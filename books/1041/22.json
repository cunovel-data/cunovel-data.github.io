{"id":16288,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. KANUCK.","content":"When he set forth upon his journey, Joseph had enough of natural shrewdness to perceive that his own personal interest in the speculation were better kept secret. The position of the Amaranth property, inserted like a wedge between the Fluke and Chowder Companies, was all the geography he needed; and he determined to assume the character of a curious traveller,—at least for a day or two,—to keep his eyes and ears open, and learn as much as might be possible to one outside the concentric \"rings\" of oil operations. He reached Corry without adventure, and took passage in the train to Oil City, intending to make the latter place the starting-point of his investigations. The car was crowded, and his companion on the seat was a keen, witty, red-faced man, with an astonishing diamond pin and a gold watch-chain heavy enough to lift an anchor. He was too restless, too full of \"operative\" energy, to travel in silence, as is the universal and most dismal American habit; and before they passed three stations he had extracted from Joseph the facts that he was a stranger, that he intended visiting the principal wells, and that he might possibly (Joseph allowing the latter point to be inferred) be tempted to invest something, if the aspects were propitious. \"You must be sure to take a look at my wells,\" said the stranger; \"not that any of our stock is in the market,—it is never offered to the public, unless accidentally,—but they will give you an illustration of the magnitude of the business. All wells, you know, sink after a while to what some people call the normal flowing capacity (we oilers call it \u0027the everidge run\u0027), and so it was reported of ourn. But since we\u0027ve begun to torpedo them, it\u0027s almost equal to the first tapping, though I don\u0027t suppose it\u0027ll hold out so long.\" \"Are the torpedoes generally used?\" Joseph asked, in some surprise. \"They\u0027re generally tried, anyhow. The cute fellow who first hit upon the idea meant to keep it dark, but the oilers, you\u0027ll find, have got their teeth skinned, and what they can\u0027t find out isn\u0027t worth finding out! Lord! I torpedoed my wells at midnight, and it wasn\u0027t a week before the Fluke was at it, bustin\u0027 and bustin\u0027 all their dry auger-holes!\" \"The what!\" Joseph exclaimed. \"Fluke. Queer name, isn\u0027t it? But that\u0027s nothing: we have the Crinoline, the Pipsissaway, the Mud-Lark, and the Sunburst, between us and Tideoute.\" \"What is the name of your company, if I may ask?\" \"About as queer as any of \u0027em,—the Chowder.\" Joseph started, in spite of himself. \"It seems to me I have heard of that company,\" he managed to say. \"O no doubt,\" replied the stranger. \"\u0027T isn\u0027t often quoted in the papers, but it\u0027s known. I\u0027m rather proud of it, for I got it up. I was boring—boss, though—at three dollars a day, two years ago, and now I have my forty thousand a year, \u0027free of income tax,\u0027 as the Insurance Companies say. But then, where one is lucky like the Chowder, a hundred busts.\" Joseph rapidly collected himself while the man was speaking. \"I should very much like to see your wells,\" he said. \"Will you be there a day or two from now? My name is Asten,—not that you have ever heard of it before.\" \"Shall be glad to hear it again, though, and to see you,\" said the man. \"My name is Blenkinsop.\" Again it was all that Joseph could do to restrain his astonishment. \"I suppose you are the President of the Chowder?\" he ventured to say. \"Yes,\" Mr. Blenkinsop answered, \"since it\u0027s a company. It was all mine at the start, but I wanted capital, and I had to work \u0027em.\" \"What other important companies are there near you?\" \"None of any account, except the Fluke and the Depravity. They flow tolerable now, after torpedoing. To be sure, there are kites and catches with all sorts o\u0027 names,—the Penny-royal, the Ruby, the Wallholler (whatever that is), and the Amaranth,—ha, ha!\" \"I think I have heard of the Amaranth,\" Joseph mildly remarked. \"Lord! are you bit already?\" Mr. Blenkinsop exclaimed, fixing his small, sharp eyes on Joseph\u0027s face. \"I—I really don\u0027t know what you mean.\" \"No offence: I thought it likely, that\u0027s all. The Amaranth is Kanuck\u0027s last dodge. He keeps mighty close, but if he don\u0027t feather his nest in a hurry, at somebody\u0027s expense, I ain\u0027t no judge o\u0027 men!\" Joseph did not dare to mention the Amaranth again. He parted with Mr. Blenkinsop at Tarr Farm, and went on to Oil City, where he spent a day in unprofitable wanderings, and then set out up the river, first to seek the Chowder wells, and afterwards to ascertain whether there was any perennial beauty in the Amaranth. The first thing which he remarked was the peculiar topography of the region. The Chowder property was a sloping bottom, gradually rising from the river to a range of high hills a quarter of a mile in the rear. Just above this point the river made a sharp horseshoe bend, washing the foot of the hills for a considerable distance, and then curving back again, with a second tract of bottom-land beyond. On the latter, he was informed, the Fluke wells were located. The inference was therefore irresistible that the Amaranth Company must be the happy possessor of the lofty section of hills dividing the two. \"Do they get oil up there?\" he asked of Blenkinsop\u0027s foreman, pointing to the ragged, barren heights. \"They may get skunk oil, or rattlesnake oil,\" the man answered. \"Them\u0027ll do to peddle, but you can\u0027t fill tanks with \u0027em. I hear they\u0027ve got a company for that place,—th\u0027 Amaranth, they call it,—but any place\u0027ll do for derned fools. Why, look \u0027ee here! We\u0027ve got seven hundred feet to bore: now, jest put twelve hundred more atop o\u0027 that, and guess whether they can even pump oil, with the Chowder and Fluke both sides of \u0027em! But it does for green \u0027uns, as well as any other place.\" Joseph laughed,—a most feeble, unnatural, ridiculous laugh. \"I\u0027ll walk over that way to the Fluke,\" he said. \"I should like to see how such things are managed.\" \"Then be a little on your guard with Kanuck, if you meet him,\" the man good-naturedly advised. \"Don\u0027t ask him too many questions.\" It was a hot, wearisome climb to the timber-skeletons on the summit (more like gibbets than anything else), which denoted shafts to the initiated as well as the ignorant eye. There were a dozen or more, but all were deserted. Joseph wandered from one to the other, asking himself, as he inspected each, \"Is this the splendid speculation?\" What was there in that miserable, shabby, stony region, a hundred acres of which would hardly pasture a cow, whence wealth should come? Verily, as stony and as barren were the natures of the men, who on this wretched basis built their cheating schemes! A little farther on he came to a deep ravine, cleaving the hills in twain. There was another skeleton in its bed, but several shabby individuals were gathered about it,—the first sign of life or business he had yet discovered. He hastened down the steep declivity, the warning of the Chowder foreman recurring to his mind, yet it seemed so difficult to fix his policy in advance that he decided to leave everything to chance. As he approached he saw that the men were laborer\u0027s, with the exception of a tall, lean individual, who looked like an unfortunate clergyman. He had a sallow face, lighted by small, restless, fiery eyes, which reminded Joseph, when they turned upon him, of those of a black snake. His greeting was cold and constrained, and his manner said plainly, \"The sooner you leave the better I shall be satisfied.\" \"This is a rough country for walking,\" said Joseph; \"how much farther is it to the Fluke wells?\" \"Just a bit,\" said one of the workmen. Joseph took a seat on a stone, with the air of one who needed rest. \"This well, I suppose,\" he remarked, \"belongs to the Amaranth?\" \"Who told you so?\" asked the lean, dark man. \"They said below, at the Chowder, that the Amaranth was up here.\" \"Did Blenkinsop send you this way?\" the man asked again. \"Nobody sent me,\" Joseph replied. \"I am a stranger, taking a look at the oil country. I have never before been in this part of the State.\" \"May I ask your name?\" \"Asten,\" said Joseph, unthinkingly. \"Asten! I think I know where that name belongs. Let me see.\" The man pulled out a large dirty envelope from his breast-pocket, ran over several papers, unfolded one, and presently asked,— \"Joseph Asten?\" \"Yes.\" (Joseph set his teeth, and silently cursed his want of forethought.) \"Proprietor of ten thousand dollars\u0027 worth of stock in the Amaranth! Who sent you here?\" His tone, though meant to be calm, was fierce and menacing. Joseph rose, scanned the faces of the workmen, who listened with a malicious curiosity, and finally answered, with a candor which seemed to impress, while it evidently disappointed the questioner:— \"No one sent me, and no one, beyond my own family, knows that I am here. I am a farmer, not a speculator. I was induced to take the stock from representations which have not been fulfilled, and which, I am now convinced, never will be fulfilled. My habit is, when I cannot get the truth from others, to ascertain it for myself. I presume you are Mr. Kanuck?\" The man did not answer immediately, but the quick, intelligent glance of one of the workmen showed Joseph that his surmise was correct. Mr. Kanuck conversed apart with the men, apparently giving private orders, and then, said, with a constrained civility:— \"If you are bound for the Fluke, Mr. Asten, I will join you. I am also going in that direction, and we can talk on the way.\" They toiled up the opposite side of the ravine in silence. When they had reached the top and taken breath, Mr. Kanuck commenced:— \"I must infer that you have little faith in anything being realized from the Amaranth. Any man, ignorant of the technicalities of boring, might be discouraged by the external appearance of things; and I shall therefore not endeavor to explain to you my grounds of hope, unless you will agree to join me for a month or two and become practically acquainted with the locality and the modes of labor.\" \"That is unnecessary,\" Joseph replied. \"You being a farmer, of course I could not expect it. On the other hand, I think I can appreciate your,—disappointment, if we must call it so, and I should be willing, under certain conditions, to save you, not from positive loss, because I do not admit the possibility of that, but from what, at present, may seem loss to you. Do I make my meaning clear?\" \"Entirely,\" Joseph replied, \"except as to the conditions.\" \"We are dealing on the square, I take it?\" \"Of course.\" \"Then,\" said Mr. Kanuck, \"I need only intimate to you how important it is that I should develop our prospects. To do this, the faith of the principal stockholders must not be disturbed, otherwise the funds without which the prospects cannot be developed may fail me at the critical moment. Your hasty and unintelligent impressions, if expressed in a reckless manner, might do much to bring about such a catastrophe. I must therefore stipulate that you keep such impressions to yourself. Let me speak to you as man to man, and ask you if your expressions, not being founded on knowledge, would be honest? So far from it, you will be bound in all fairness, in consideration of my releasing you and restoring you what you have ventured, to adopt and disseminate the views of an expert,—namely, mine.\" \"Let me put it into fewer words,\" said Joseph. \"You will buy my stock, repaying me what I have disbursed, if, on my return, I say nothing of what I have seen, and express my perfect faith (adopting your views) in the success of the Amaranth?\" \"You have stated the conditions a little barely, perhaps, but not incorrectly. I only ask for perfect fairness, as between man and man.\" \"One question first, Mr. Kanuck. Does Mr. Blessing know the real prospects of the Amaranth?\" \"No man more thoroughly, I assure you, Mr. Asten. Indeed, without Mr. Blessing\u0027s enthusiastic concurrence in the enterprise, I doubt whether we could have carried the work so far towards success. His own stock, I may say to you,—since we understand each other,—was earned by his efforts. If you know him intimately, you know also that he has no visible means of support. But he has what is much more important to us,—a thorough knowledge of men and their means.\" He rubbed his hands, and laughed softly. They had been walking rapidly during the conversation, and now came suddenly upon the farthest crest of the hills, where the ridge fell away to the bottom occupied by the Fluke wells. Both paused at this point. \"On the square, then!\" said Mr. Kanuck, offering his hand. \"Tell me where you will be to-morrow morning, and our business can be settled in five minutes. You will carry out your part of the bargain, as man to man, when you find that I carry out mine.\" \"Do you take me for an infernal scoundrel?\" cried Joseph, boiling over with disgust and rage. Mr. Kanuck stepped back a pace or two. His sallow face became livid, and there was murder in his eyes. He put his hand into his breast, and Joseph, facing him, involuntarily did the same. Not until long afterwards, when other experiences had taught him the significance of the movement, did he remember what it then meant. \"So! that\u0027s your game, is it?\" his antagonist said, hissing the words through his teeth. \"A spy, after all! Or a detective, perhaps? I was a fool to trust a milk-and-water face: but one thing I tell you,—you may get away, but come back again if you dare!\" Joseph said nothing, but gazed steadily in the man\u0027s eyes, and did not move from his position so long as he was within sight. Then, breathing deeply, as if relieved from the dread of an unknown danger, he swiftly descended the hill. That evening, as he sat in the bar-room of a horrible shanty (called a hotel), farther up the river, he noticed a pair of eyes fixed intently upon him: they belonged to one of the workmen in the Amaranth ravine. The man made an almost imperceptible signal, and left the room. Joseph followed him. \"Hush!\" whispered the former. \"Don\u0027t come back to the hill; and get away from here to-morrow morning, if you can!\" With these words he darted off and disappeared in the darkness. The counsel was unnecessary. Joseph, with all his inexperience of the world, saw plainly that his only alternatives were loss—or connivance. Nothing was to be gained by following the vile business any further. He took the earliest possible train, and by the afternoon of the following day found himself again in the city. He was conscious of no desire to meet Mr. Blessing, yet the pressure of his recent experience seemed to drive him irresistibly in that direction. When he rang the bell, it was with the hope that he should find nobody at home. Mr. Blessing, however, answered the summons, and after the first expression of surprise, ushered him into the parlor. \"I am quite alone,\" he said; \"Mrs. Blessing is passing the evening with her sister, Mrs. Woollish, and Clementina is still at Long Branch. I believe it is as good as settled that we are to lose her; at least she has written to inquire the extent of my available funds, which, in her case, is tantamount to—very much more.\" Joseph determined to avoid all digressions, and insist on the Amaranth speculation, once for all, being clearly discussed. He saw that his father-in-law became more uneasy and excited as he advanced in the story of his journey, and, when it was concluded, did not seem immediately prepared to reply. His suspicions, already aroused by Mr. Kanuck\u0027s expressions, were confirmed, and a hard, relentless feeling of hostility took possession of his heart. \"I—I really must look into this,\" Mr. Blessing stammered, at last. \"It seems incredible: pardon me, but I would doubt the statements, did they come from other lips than yours. It is as if I had nursed a dove in my bosom, and unexpectedly found it to be a—a basilisk!\" \"It can be no serious loss to you,\" said Joseph, \"since you received your stock in return for services.\" \"That is true: I was not thinking of myself. The real sting of the cockatrice is, that I have innocently misled you.\" \"Yet I understood you to say you had ventured your all?\" \"My all of hope—my all of expectation!\" Mr. Blessing cried. \"I dreamed I had overtaken the rainbow at last; but this—this is senna—-quassia—aloes! My nature is so confiding that I accept the possibilities of the future as present realities, and build upon them as if they were Quincy granite. And yet, with all my experience, my acknowledged sagacity, my acquaintance with the hidden labyrinths of finance, it seems impossible that I can be so deceived! There must be some hideous misunderstanding: I have calculated all the elements, prognosticated all the planetary aspects, so to speak, and have not found a whisper of failure!\" \"You omitted one very important element,\" Joseph said. \"What is that? I might have employed a detective, it is true—\" \"No!\" Joseph replied. \"Honesty!\" Mr. Blessing fell back in his chair, weeping bitterly. \"I deserve this!\" he exclaimed. \"I will not resent it. I forgive you in advance of the time when you shall recognize my sincere, my heartfelt wish to serve you! Go, go: let me not recriminate! I meant to be, and still mean to be, your friend: but spare my too confiding child!\" Without a word of good-by, Joseph took his hat and hastened from the house. At every step the abyss of dishonesty seemed to open deeper before his feet. Spare the too confiding child! Father and daughter were alike: both mean, both treacherous, both unpardonably false to him. With such feelings he left the city next morning, and made his way homewards.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52735.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
