{"id":16285,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. THE \"WHARF-RAT.\"","content":"On his way home Joseph reviewed the quarrel with a little more calmness, and, while admitting his own rashness and want of tact, felt relieved that it had occurred. Julia now knew, at least, how sorely he had been grieved by her selfishness, and she had thus an opportunity, if she really loved him, of showing whether her nature were capable of change. He determined to make no further reference to the dissension, and to avoid what might lead to a new one. He did not guess, as he approached the house, that his wife had long been watching at the front window, in an anxious, excited state, and that she only slipped back to the sofa and covered her head just before he reached the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n For a day or two she was silent, and perhaps a little sullen; but the payment of the most pressing bills, the progress of the new embellishments, and the necessity of retaining her affectionate playfulness in the presence of the workmen, brought back her customary manner. Now and then a sharp, indirect allusion showed that she had not forgotten, and had not Joseph closed his teeth firmly upon his tongue, the household atmosphere might have been again disturbed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Not many days elapsed before a very brief note from Mr. Blessing announced that the fifth instalment would be needed. He wrote in great haste, he said, and would explain everything by a later mail. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph was hardly surprised now. He showed the note to Julia, merely saying: \"I have not the money, and if I had, he could scarcely expect me to pay it without knowing the necessity. My best plan will be to go to the city at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think so, too,\" she answered. \"You will be far better satisfied when you have seen pa, and he can also help you to raise the money temporarily, if it is really inevitable. He knows all the capitalists.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall do another thing, Julia. I shall sell enough of the stock to pay the instalment; nay, I shall sell it all, if I can do so without loss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you—\" she began fiercely, but, checking herself, merely added, \"see pa first, that\u0027s all I stipulate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Blessing had not returned from the Custom-House when Joseph reached the city. He had no mind to sit in the dark parlor and wait; so he plunged boldly into the labyrinth of clerks, porters, inspectors, and tide-waiters. Everybody knew Blessing, but nobody could tell where he was to be found. Finally some one, more obliging than the rest, said: \"Try the Wharf-Rat!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Wharf-Rat proved to be a \"saloon\" in a narrow alley behind the Custom-House. On opening the door, a Venetian screen prevented the persons at the bar from being immediately seen, but Joseph recognized his father-in-law\u0027s voice, saying, \"Straight, if you please!\" Mr. Blessing was leaning against one end of the bar, with a glass in his hand, engaged with an individual of not very prepossessing appearance. He remarked to the latter, almost in a whisper (though the words reached Joseph\u0027s ears), \"You understand, the collector can\u0027t be seen every day; it takes time, and—more or less capital. The doorkeeper and others expect to be fed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As Joseph approached, he turned towards him with an angry, auspicious look, which was not changed into one of welcome so soon that a flash of uncomfortable surprise did not intervene. But the welcome once there, it deepened and mellowed, and became so warm and rich that only a cold, contracted nature could have refused to bathe in its effulgence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why!\" he cried, with extended hands, \"I should as soon have expected to see daisies growing in this sawdust, or to find these spittoons smelling like hyacinths! Mr. Tweed, one of our rising politicians, Mr. Asten, my son-in-law! Asten, of Asten Hall, I might almost say, for I hear that your mansion is assuming quite a palatial aspect. Another glass, if you please: your throat must be full of dust, Joseph,—pulvis faucibus h?sit, if I might be allowed to change the classic phrase.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph tried to decline, but was forced to compromise on a moderate glass of ale; while Mr. Blessing, whose glass was empty, poured something into it from a black bottle, nodded to Mr. Tweed, and saying, \"Always straight!\" drank it off. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You would not suppose,\" he then said to Joseph, \"that this little room, dark as it is, and not agreeably fragrant, has often witnessed the arrangement of political man?uvres which have decided the City, and through the City the State. I have seen together at that table, at midnight, Senator Slocum, and the Honorables Whitstone, Hacks, and Larruper. Why, the First Auditor of the Treasury was here no later than last week! I frequently transact some of the confidential business of the Custom-House within these precincts, as at present.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shall I wait for you outside?\" Joseph asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think it will not be necessary. I have stated the facts, Mr. Tweed, and if you accept them, the figures can be arranged between us at any time. It is a simple case of algebra: by taking x, you work out the unknown quantity.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With a hearty laugh at his own smartness, he shook the \"rising politician\u0027s\" hand, and left the Wharf-Rat with Joseph. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We can talk here as well as in the woods,\" he said. \"Nobody ever hears anything in this crowd. But perhaps we had better not mention the Amaranth by name, as the operation has been kept so very close. Shall we say \u0027Paraguay\u0027 instead, or—still better—\u0027Reading,\u0027 which is a very common stock? Well, then, I guess you have come to see me in relation to the Reading?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph, as briefly as possible, stated the embarrassment he suffered, on account of the continued calls for payment, the difficulty of raising money for the fifth instalment, and bluntly expressed his doubts of the success of the speculation. Mr. Blessing heard him patiently to the end, and then, having collected himself, answered:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I understand, most perfectly, your feeling in the matter. Further, I do not deny that in respect to the time of realizing from the Am—Reading, I should say—I have also been disappointed. It has cost me no little trouble to keep my own shares intact, and my stake is so much greater than yours, for it is my all! I am ready to unite with the Chowder, at once: indeed, as one of the directors, I mentioned it at our last meeting, but the proposition, I regret to say, was not favorably entertained. We are dependent, in a great measure, on Kanuck, who is on the spot superintending the Reading; he has been telegraphed to come on, and promises to do so as soon as the funds now called for are forthcoming. My faith, I hardly need intimate, is firm.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My only resource, then,\" said Joseph, \"will be to sell a portion of my stock, I suppose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is one drawback to that course, and I am afraid you may not quite understand my explanation. The—Reading has not been introduced in the market, and its real value could not be demonstrated without betraying the secret lever by which we intend hoisting it to a fancy height. We could only dispose of a portion of it to capitalists whom we choose to take into our confidence. The same reason would be valid against hypothecation.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you paid this last instalment?\" Joseph suddenly asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"N—no; not wholly; but I anticipate a temporary accommodation. If Mr. Spelter deprives me of Clementina, as I hear (through third parties) is daily becoming more probable, my family expenses will be so diminished that I shall have an ample margin; indeed, I shall feel like a large paper copy, with my leaves uncut!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He rubbed his hands gleefully; but Joseph was too much disheartened to reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This might be done,\" Mr. Blessing continued. \"It is not certain that all the stockholders have yet paid. I will look over the books, and if such be the case, your delay would not be a sporadic delinquency. If otherwise, I will endeavor to gain the consent of my fellow-directors to the introduction of a new capitalist, to whom a small portion of your interest may be transferred. I trust you perceive the relevancy of this caution. We do not mean that our flower shall always blush unseen, and waste its sweetness on the oleaginous air; we only wish to guard against its being \u0027untimely ripped\u0027 (as Shakespeare says) from its parent stalk. I can well imagine how incomprehensible all this may appear to you. In all probability much of your conversation at home, relative to crops and the like, would be to me an unknown dialect. But I should not, therefore, doubt your intelligence and judgment in such matters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph began to grow impatient. \"Do I understand you to say, Mr. Blessing,\" he asked, \"that the call for the fifth instalment can be met by the sale of a part of my stock?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In an ordinary case it might not—under the peculiar circumstances of our operation—be possible. But I trust I do not exaggerate my own influence when I say that it is within my power to arrange it. If you will confide it to my hands, you understand, of course, that a slight formality is necessary,—a power of attorney?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph, in his haste and excitement, had not considered this, or any other legal point: Mr. Blessing was right. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then, supposing the shares to be worth only their par value,\" he said, \"the power need not apply to more than one-tenth of my stock?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Blessing came into collision with a gentleman passing him. Mutual wrath was aroused, followed by mutual apologies. \"Let us turn into the other street,\" he said to Joseph; \"really, our lives are hardly safe in this crowd; it is nearly three o\u0027clock, and the banks will soon be closed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It would be prudent to allow a margin,\" he resumed, after their course had been changed: \"the money market is very tight, and if a necessity were suspected, most capitalists are unprincipled enough to exact according to the urgency of the need. I do not say—nor do I at all anticipate—that it would be so in your case; still, the future is a sort of dissolving view, and my suggestion is that of the merest prudence. I have no doubt that double the amount—say one-fifth of your stock—would guard us against all contingencies. If you prefer not to intrust the matter to my hands, I will introduce you to Honeyspoon Brothers, the bankers,—the elder Honeyspoon being a director,—who will be very ready to execute your commission.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n What could Joseph do? It was impossible to say to Mr. Blessing\u0027s face that he mistrusted him: yet he certainly did not trust! He was weary of plausible phrases, the import of which he was powerless to dispute, yet which were so at variance with what seemed to be the facts of the case. He felt that he was lifted aloft into a dazzling, secure atmosphere, but as often as he turned to look at the wings which upheld him, their plumage shrivelled into dust, and he fell an immense distance before his feet touched a bit of reality. \\n\\n \\n\\n The power of attorney was given. Joseph declined Mr. Blessing\u0027s invitation to dine with him at the Universal Hotel, the Blessing table being \"possibly a little lean to one accustomed to the bountiful profusion of the country,\" on the plea that he must return by the evening train; but such a weariness and disgust came over him that he halted at the Farmers\u0027 Tavern, and took a room for the night. He slept until long into the morning, and then, cheered in spirit through the fresh vigor of all his physical functions, started homewards. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52732.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
