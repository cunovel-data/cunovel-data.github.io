{"id":16274,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. A CONSULTATION.","content":"The family tea was served in a small dining-room in the rear. Mr. Blessing, who had become more and more cordial with Joseph after formally accepting him, led the way thither, and managed to convey a rapid signal to his wife before the family took their seats at the table. Joseph was the only one who did not perceive the silent communication of intelligence; but its consequences were such as to make him speedily feel at ease in the Blessing mansion. Even Clementina relented sufficiently to say, in her most silvery tones, \"May I offer you the butter, Mr. Asten?\" \n \n The table, it is true, was very unlike the substantial suppers of the country. There was a variety of diminutive dishes, containing slices so delicate that they mocked rather than excited the appetite; yet Julia, (of course it was she!) had managed to give the repast an air of elegance which was at least agreeable to a kindred sense. Joseph took the little cup, the thin tea, the five drops of milk, and the fragment of sugar, without asking himself whether the beverage were palatable: he divided a leaf-like piece of flesh and consumed several wafers of bread, blissfully unconscious whether his stomach were satisfied. He felt that he had been received into The Family. Mr. Blessing was magnificently bland, Mrs. Blessing was maternally interested, Clementina recognized his existence, and Julia,—he needed but one look at her sparkling eyes, her softly flushed cheeks, her bewitching excitement of manner, to guess the relief of her heart. He forgot the vague distress which had preceded his coming, and the embarrassment of his first reception, in the knowledge that Julia was so happy, and through the acquiescence of her parents, in his love. \n \n It was settled that he should pass the night there. Mrs. Blessing would take no denial; he must now consider their house as his home. She would also call him \"Joseph,\" but not now,—not until she was entitled to name him \"son.\" It had come suddenly upon her, but it was her duty to be glad, and in a little while she would become accustomed to the change. \n \n All this was so simply and cordially said, that Joseph quite warmed to the stately woman, and unconsciously decided to accept his fortune, whatever features it might wear. Until the one important event, at least; after that it would be in his own hands—and Julia\u0027s. \n \n After tea, two or three hours passed away rather slowly. Mr. Blessing sat in the pit of a back yard and smoked until dusk; then the family collected in the \"drawing-room,\" and there was a little music, and a variety of gossip, with occasional pauses of silence, until Mrs. Blessing said: \"Perhaps you had better show Mr. Asten to his room, Mr. Blessing. We may have already passed over his accustomed hour for retiring. If so, I know he will excuse us; we shall soon become familiar with each other\u0027s habits.\" \n \n When Mr. Blessing returned, he first opened the rear window, drew an arm-chair near it, took off his coat, seated himself, and lit another cigar. His wife closed the front shutters, slipped the night-bolts of the door, and then seated herself beside him. Julia whirled around on her music-stool to face the coming consultation, and Clementina gracefully posed herself in the nearest corner of the sofa. \n \n \"How do you like him, Eliza?\" Mr. Blessing asked, after several silent, luxurious whiffs. \n \n \"He is handsome, and seems amiable, but younger than I expected. Are you sure of his—his feelings, Julia?\" \n \n \"O ma!\" Julia exclaimed; \"what a question! I can only judge them by my own.\" \n \n Clementina curled her lip in a singular fashion, but said nothing. \n \n \"It seems like losing Julia entirely,\" Mrs. Blessing resumed. \"I don\u0027t know how she will be able to retain her place in our circle, unless they spend a part of the winter in the city, and whether he has means enough—\" \n \n She paused, and looked inquisitively at her husband. \n \n \"You always look at the establishment,\" said he, \"and never consider the chances. Marriage is a deal, a throw, a sort of kite-flying, in fact (except in our case, my dear), and, after all I\u0027ve learned of our future son-in-law, I must say that Julia hasn\u0027t a bad hand.\" \n \n \"I knew you\u0027d like him, pa!\" cried the delighted Julia. \n \n Mr. Blessing looked at her steadily a moment, and then winked; but she took no notice of it. \n \n \"There is another thing,\" said his wife. \"If the wedding comes off this fall, we have but two months to prepare; and how will you manage about the—the money? We can save afterwards, to be sure, but there will be an immediate and fearful expense. I\u0027ve thought, perhaps, that a simple and private ceremony,—married in travelling-dress, you know, just before the train leaves, and no cards,—it is sometimes done in the highest circles.\" \n \n \"It won\u0027t do!\" exclaimed Mr. Blessing, waving his right hand. \"Julia\u0027s husband must have an opportunity of learning our standing in society. I will invite the Collector, and the Surveyor, and the Appraiser. The money must be raised. I should be willing to pawn—\" \n \n He looked around the room, inspecting the well-worn carpet, the nankeen-covered chairs, the old piano, and finally the two pictures. \n \n \"—Your portrait, my dear; but, unless it were a Stuart, I couldn\u0027t get ten dollars on it. We must take your set of diamonds, and Julia\u0027s rubies, and Clementina\u0027s pearls.\" \n \n He leaned back, and laughed with great glee. The ladies became rigid and grave. \n \n \"It is wicked, Benjamin,\" Mrs. Blessing severely remarked, \"to jest over our troubles at such a time as this. I see nothing else to do, but to inform Mr. Asten, frankly, of our condition. He is yet too young, I think, to be repelled by poverty.\" \n \n \"Ma, it would break my heart,\" said Julia. \"I could not bear to be humiliated in his eyes.\" \n \n \"Decidedly the best thing to do,\" warbled Clementina, speaking for the first time. \n \n \"That\u0027s the way with women,—flying from one extreme to the other. If you can\u0027t have white, you turn around and say there\u0027s no other color than black. When all devices are exhausted, a man of pluck and character goes to work and constructs a new one. Upon my soul, I don\u0027t know where the money is to come from; but give me ten days, and Julia shall have her white satin. Now, girls, you had better go to bed.\" \n \n Mr. Blessing smoked silently until the sound of his daughters\u0027 footsteps had ceased on the stairs; then, bringing down his hand emphatically upon his thigh, he exclaimed, \"By Jove, Eliza, if I were as sharp as that girl, I\u0027d have had the Collectorship before this!\" \n \n \"What do you mean? She seems to be strongly attached to him.\" \n \n \"O, no doubt! But she has a wonderful talent for reading character. The young fellow is pretty green wood still; what he\u0027ll season into depends on her. Honest as the day,—there\u0027s nothing like a country life for that. But it\u0027s a pity that such a fund for operations should lie idle; he has a nest-egg that might hatch out millions!\" \n \n \"I hope, Benjamin, that after all your unfortunate experience—\" \n \n \"Pray don\u0027t lament in advance, and especially now, when a bit of luck comes to us. Julia has done well, and I\u0027ll trust her to improve her opportunities. Besides, this will help Clementina\u0027s chances; where there is one marriage in a family, there is generally another. Poor girl! she has waited a long while. At thirty-three, the market gets v-e-r-y flat.\" \n \n \"And yet Julia is thirty,\" said Mrs. Blessing; \"and Clementina\u0027s complexion and manners have been considered superior.\" \n \n \"There\u0027s just her mistake. A better copy of Mrs. Halibut\u0027s airs and attitudes was never produced, and it was all very well so long as Mrs. Halibut gave the tone to society; but since she went to Europe, and Mrs. Bass has somehow crept into her place, Clementina is quite—I may say—obsolete. I don\u0027t object to her complexion, because that is a standing fashion, but she is expected to be chatty, and witty, and instead of that she stands about like a Venus of Milo. She looks like me, and she can\u0027t lack intelligence and tact. Why couldn\u0027t she unbend a little more to Asten, whether she likes him or not?\" \n \n \"You know I never seemed to manage Clementina,\" his wife replied; \"if she were to dispute my opinion sometimes, I might, perhaps, gain a little influence over her: but she won\u0027t enter into a discussion.\" \n \n \"Mrs. Halibut\u0027s way. It was new, then, and, with her husband\u0027s money to back it, her \u0027grace\u0027 and \u0027composure\u0027 and \u0027serenity\u0027 carried all before her. Give me fifty thousand a year, and I\u0027ll put Clementina in the same place! But, come,—to the main question. I suppose we shall need five hundred dollars!\" \n \n \"Three hundred, I think, will be ample,\" said Mrs. Blessing. \n \n \"Three or five, it\u0027s as hard to raise one sum as the other. I\u0027ll try for five, and if I have luck with the two hundred over—small, careful operations, you know, which always succeed—I may have the whole amount on hand, long before it\u0027s due.\" \n \n Mrs. Blessing smiled in a melancholy, hopeless way, and the consultation came to an end. \n \n When Joseph was left alone in his chamber, he felt no inclination to sleep. He sat at the open window, and looked down into the dim, melancholy street, the solitude of which was broken about once every quarter of an hour by a forlorn pedestrian, who approached through gloom and lamplight, was foreshortened to his hat, and then lengthened away on the other side. The new acquaintances he had just made remained all the more vividly in his thoughts from their nearness; he was still within their atmosphere. They were unlike any persons he knew, and therefore he felt that he might do them injustice by a hasty estimate of their character. Clementina, however, was excluded from this charitable resolution. Concentrating his dislike on her, he found that her parents had received him with as much consideration as a total stranger could expect. Moreover, whatever they might be, Julia was the same here, in her own home, as when she was a guest in the country. As playful, as winning, and as natural; and he began to suspect that her present life was not congenial to such a nature. If so, her happiness was all the more assured by their union. \n \n This thought led him into a pictured labyrinth of anticipation, in which his mind wandered with delight. He was so absorbed in planning the new household, that he did not hear the sisters entering the rear room on the same floor, which was only separated by a thin partition from his own. \n \n \"White satin!\" he suddenly heard Clementina say: \"of course I shall have the same. It will become me better than you.\" \n \n \"I should think you might be satisfied with a light silk,\" Julia said; \"the expenses will be very heavy.\" \n \n \"We\u0027ll see,\" Clementina answered shortly, pacing up and down the room. \n \n After a long pause, he heard Julia\u0027s voice again. \"Never mind,\" she said, \"I shall soon be out of your way.\" \n \n \"I wonder how much he knows about you!\" Clementina exclaimed. \"Your arts were new there, and you played an easy game.\" Here she lowered her voice, and Joseph only distinguished a detached word now and then. He rose, indignant at this unsisterly assault, and wishing to hear no more; but it seemed that the movement was not noticed, for Julia replied, in smothered, excited tones, with some remark about \"complexion.\" \n \n \"Well, there is one thing,\" Clementina continued,—\"one thing you will keep very secret, and that is your birthday. Are you going to tell him that you are—\" \n \n Joseph had seized the back of a chair and with a sudden impulse tilted it and let it fall on the floor. Then he walked to the window, closed it, and prepared to go to rest,—all with more noise than was habitual with him. There were whispers and hushed movements in the next room, but not another audible word was spoken. Before sleeping he came to the conclusion that he was more than Julia\u0027s lover: he was her deliverer. The idea was not unwelcome: it gave a new value and significance to his life. \n \n However curious Julia might have been to discover how much he had overheard, she made no effort to ascertain the fact. She met him next morning with a sweet unconsciousness of what she had endured, which convinced him that such painful scenes must have been frequent, or she could not have forgotten so easily. His greeting to Clementina was brief and cold, but she did not seem to notice it in the least. \n \n It was decided, before he left, that the wedding should take place in October. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52721.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
