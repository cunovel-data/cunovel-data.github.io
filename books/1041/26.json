{"id":16292,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. THE ACCUSATION.","content":"For a few days it almost seemed to Joseph that the old order of his existence had been suddenly restored, and the year of his betrothal and marriage had somehow been intercalated into his life simply as a test and trial. Rachel Miller was back again, in her old capacity, and he did not yet see—what would have been plain to any other eyes—that her manner towards him was far more respectful and considerate than formerly. But, in fact, she made a wide distinction between the \"boy\" that he had been and the man and widower which he had come to be. At first, she had refused to see the dividing line: having crossed it, her new course soon became as natural and fixed as the old. She was the very type of a mechanically developed old maid,—inflexibly stern towards male youth, devotedly obedient to male maturity. Joseph had been too profoundly moved to lose at once the sense of horror which the manner of Julia\u0027s death had left in his heart. He could not forgive himself for having, though never so ignorantly, driven her to madness. He was troubled, restless, unhappy; and the mention of his loss was so painful that he made every effort to avoid hearing it. Some of his neighbors, he imagined, were improperly curious in their inquiries. He felt bound, since the doctor had suggested it, since Philip and Lucy had acquiesced, and Mrs. Blessing had expressed so much alarm lest it might become known, to keep the suicide a secret; but he was driven so closely by questions and remarks that his task became more and more difficult. Had the people taken offence at his reticence? It seemed so; for their manner towards him was certainly changed. Something in the look and voice; an indefinable uneasiness at meeting him; an awkward haste and lame excuses for it,—all these things forced themselves upon his mind. Elwood Withers, alone, met him as of old, with even a tenderer though a more delicately veiled affection; yet in Elwood\u0027s face he detected the signs of a grave trouble. It could not be possible, he thought, that Elwood had heard some surmise, or distorted echo, of his words to Lucy in the garden,—that there had been another listener besides Julia! There were times, again, when he doubted all these signs, when he ascribed them to his own disturbed mind, and decided to banish them from his memory. He would stay quietly at home, he resolved, and grow into a healthier mood: he would avoid the society of men, until he should cease to wrong them by his suspicions. First, however, he would see Philip; but on reaching the Forge he found Philip absent. Madeline received him with a subdued kindness in which he felt her sympathy; but it was also deeper, he acknowledged to himself, than he had any right to claim. \"You do not see much of your neighbors, I think, Mr. Asten?\" she asked. The tone of her voice indicated a slight embarrassment. \"No,\" he answered; \"I have no wish to see any but my friends.\" \"Lucy Henderson has just left us. Philip took her to her father\u0027s, and was intending to call at your place on his way home. I hope you will not miss him. That is,\" she added, while a sudden flush of color spread over her face, \"I want you to see him to-day. I beg you won\u0027t take my words as intended for a dismissal.\" \"Not now, certainly,\" said Joseph. But he rose from his seat as he spoke. Madeline looked both confused and pained. \"I know that I spoke awkwardly,\" she said, \"but indeed I was very anxious. It was also Lucy\u0027s wish. We have been talking about you this morning.\" \"You are very kind. And yet—I ought to wish you a more cheerful subject.\" What was it in Madeline\u0027s face that haunted Joseph on his way home? The lightsome spirit was gone from her eyes, and they were troubled as if by the pressure of tears, held back by a strong effort. Her assumed calmness at parting seemed to cover a secret anxiety; he had never before seen her bright, free nature so clouded. Philip, meanwhile, had reached the farm, where he was received by Rachel Miller. \"I am glad to find that Joseph is not at home,\" he said; \"there are some things which I need to discuss with you, before I see him. Can you guess what they are? Have you heard nothing,—no stories?\" Rachel\u0027s face grew pale, yet there was a strong fire of indignation in her eyes. \"Dennis told me an outrageous report he had heard in the village,\" she said: \"if you mean the same thing, you did well to see me first. You can help me to keep this insult from Joseph\u0027s knowledge.\" \"If I could I would, Miss Rachel. I share your feeling about it; but suppose the report were now so extended—and of course in a more exaggerated form the farther it goes—that we cannot avoid its probable consequences? This is not like a mere slander, which can be suffered to die of itself. It is equivalent to a criminal charge, and must be faced.\" She clasped her hands, and stared at him in terror. \"But why,\" she faltered—\"why does any one dare to make such a charge? And against the best, the most innocent—\" \"The fact of the poisoning cannot be concealed,\" said Philip. \"It appears, moreover, that one of the women who was in the house on the day of Julia\u0027s death heard her cry out to Joseph: \u0027Go away,—you have killed me!\u0027 I need not take up the reports any further; there is enough in these two circumstances to excite the suspicions of those who do not know Joseph as we do. It is better, therefore, to meet those suspicions before they come to us in a legal form.\" \"What can we do?\" cried Rachel; \"it is terrible!\" \"One course is clear, if it is possible. We must try to discover not only the cause of Julia\u0027s suicide, but the place where she procured the poison, and her design in procuring it. She must have had it already in the house.\" \"I never thought of that. And her ways were so quiet and sly! How shall we ever find it out? O, to think that, dead and gone as she is, she can yet bring all this upon Joseph!\" \"Try to be calm, Miss Rachel,\" said Philip. \"I want your help, and you must have all your wits about you. First, you must make a very careful examination of her clothing and effects, even to the merest scrap of paper. A man\u0027s good name—a man\u0027s life, sometimes—hangs upon a thread, in the most literal sense. There is no doubt that Julia meant to keep a secret, and she must have had a strong reason; but we have a stronger one, now, to discover it. First, as to the poison; was there any arsenic in the house when Julia came?\" \"Not a speck! I never kept it, even for rats.\" \"Then we shall begin with ascertaining where she bought it. Let us make our investigations secretly, and as speedily as possible. Joseph need not know, at present, what we have undertaken, but he must know the charge that hangs over him. Unless I tell him, he may learn it in a more violent way. I sent Elwood Withers to Magnolia yesterday, and his report leaves me no choice of action.\" Rachel Miller felt, from the stern gravity of Philip\u0027s manner, that he had not exaggerated Joseph\u0027s danger. She consented to be guided by him in all things; and this point being settled, they arranged a plan of action and communication, which was tolerably complete by the time Joseph returned. As gently as possible Philip broke the unwelcome news; but, lightly as he pretended to consider it, Joseph\u0027s instinct saw at once what might be the consequences. The circumstances were all burned upon his consciousness, and it needed no reflection to show him how completely he was entangled in them. \"There is no alternative,\" he said, at last. \"It was a mistake to conceal the cause of her death from the public: it is easy to misunderstand her exclamation, and make my crime out of her madness. I see the whole connection! This suspicion will not stop where it is. It will go further; and therefore I must anticipate it. I must demand a legal inquiry before the law forces one upon me. If it is not my only method of defence, it is certainly my best!\" \"You are right!\" Philip exclaimed. \"I knew this would be your decision; I said so to Madeline this morning.\" Now Madeline\u0027s confused manner became intelligible to Joseph. Yet a doubt still lingered in his mind. \"Did she, did Madeline question it?\" he asked. \"Neither she nor Lucy Henderson. If you do this, I cannot see how it will terminate without a trial. Lucy may then happen to be an important witness.\" Joseph started. \"Must that be!\" he cried. \"Has not Lucy been already forced to endure enough for my sake? Advise me, Philip! Is there any other way than that I have proposed?\" \"I see no other. But your necessity is far greater than that for Lucy\u0027s endurance. She is a friend, and there can be no sacrifice in so serving you. What are we all good for, if not to serve you in such a strait?\" \"I would like to spare her, nevertheless,\" said Joseph, gloomily. \"I meant so well towards all my friends, and my friendship seems to bring only disgrace and sorrow.\" \"Joseph!\" Philip exclaimed, \"you have saved one friend from more than disgrace and sorrow! I do not know what might have come, but you called me back from the brink of an awful, doubtful eternity! You have given me an infinite loss and an infinite gain! I only ask you, in return, to obey your first true, proud instinct of innocence, and let me, and Lucy, and Elwood be glad to take its consequences, for your sake!\" \"I cannot help myself,\" Joseph answered. \"My rash impatience and injustice will come to light, and that may be the atonement I owe. If Lucy will spare herself, and report me truly, as I must have appeared to her, she will serve me best.\" \"Leave that, now! The first step is what most concerns us. When will you be ready to demand a legal investigation?\" \"At once!—to-morrow!\" \"Then we will go together to Magnolia. I fear we cannot change the ordinary forms of procedure, and there must be bail for your appearance at the proper time.\" \"Already on the footing of a criminal?\" Joseph murmured, with a sinking of the heart. He had hardly comprehended, up to this moment, what his position would be. The next day they drove to the county town. The step had not been taken a moment too soon, for such representations had been made that a warrant for Joseph\u0027s arrest was in the hands of the constable, and would have been served in a few hours. Philip and Mr. Hopeton, who also happened to be in the town by a fortunate chance (though Philip knew how the chance came), offered to accept whatever amount of bail might be demanded. The matter was arranged as privately as possible, but it leaked out in some way, and Philip was seriously concerned lest the curiosity—perhaps, even, the ill-will—of a few persons might be manifested towards Joseph. He visited the offices of the county papers, and took care that the voluntary act should be stated in such a manner as to set its character properly before the people. Everything, he felt, depended on securing a fair and unprejudiced judgment of the case. This, indeed, was far more important than even he suspected. In a country where the press is so entirely free, and where, owing to the lazy, indifferent habit of thought—or, rather, habit of no thought—of the people, the editorial views are accepted without scrutiny, a man\u0027s good name or life may depend on the coloring given to his acts by a few individual minds, it is especially necessary to keep the balance even, to offset one statement by another, and prevent a partial presentation of the case from turning the scales in advance. The same phenomena were as likely to present themselves here, before a small public, as in the large cities, where the whole population of the country become a more or less interested public. The result might hinge, not upon Joseph\u0027s personal character as his friends knew it, but upon the political party with which he was affiliated, the church to which he belonged,—nay, even upon the accordance of his personal sentiments with the public sentiment of the community in which he lived. If he had dared to defy the latter, asserting the sacred right of his own mind to the largest liberty, he was already a marked man. Philip did not understand the extent and power of the external influences which control what we complacently call \"justice,\" but he knew something of the world, and acted in reality more prudently than he supposed. He was calm and cheerful for Joseph\u0027s sake; yet, now that the matter was irrevocably committed to the decision of a new, uninterested tribunal, he began to feel the gravity of his friend\u0027s position. \"I almost wish,\" Joseph said, as they drove homewards, \"that no bail had been granted. Since the court meets in October, a few weeks of seclusion would do me no harm; whereas now I am a suspected person to nearly all whom I may meet.\" \"It is not agreeable,\" Philip answered, \"but the discipline may be useful. The bail terminates when the trial commences, you understand, and you will have a few nights alone, as it is,—quite enough, I imagine, to make you satisfied with liberty under suspicion. However I have one demand to make, Joseph! I have thought over all possible lines of defence; I have secured legal assistance for you, and we are agreed as to the course to be adopted. I do not think you can help us at all. If we find that you can, we will call upon you; in the mean time, wait and hope!\" \"Why should I not?\" Joseph asked. \"I have nothing to fear, Philip.\" \"No!\" But Philip\u0027s emphatic answer was intended to deceive. He was purposely false, knew himself to be so, and yet his conscience never troubled him less! When they reached the farm, Philip saw by Rachel Miller\u0027s face that she had a communication to make. It required a little management to secure an interview with her without Joseph\u0027s knowledge; but some necessity for his presence at the barn favored his friend. No sooner were they alone than Rachel approached Philip hastily and said, in a hurried whisper:— \"Here! I have found something, at last! It took a mighty search: I thought I never should come upon the least bit that we could make anything of: but this was in the upper part of a box where she kept her rings and chains, and such likes! Take it,—it makes me uncomfortable to hold it in my fingers!\" She thrust a small paper into his hand. It was folded very neatly, and there was an apothecary\u0027s label on the back. Philip read: \"Ziba Linthicum\u0027s Drug store, No. 77 Main St., Magnolia.\" Under this printed address was written in large letters the word \"Arsenic.\" On unfolding the paper he saw that a little white dust remained in the creases: quite enough to identify the character of the drug. \"I shall go back to-morrow!\" he said. \"Thank Heaven, we have got one clew to the mystery! Joseph must know nothing of this until all is explained; but while I am gone make another and more thorough search! Leave no corner unexplored: I am sure we shall find something more.\" \"I\u0027d rip up her dresses!\" was Rachel\u0027s emphatic reply. \"That is, if it would do any good. But perhaps feeling of the lining and the hems might be enough. I\u0027ll take every drawer out, and move the furniture! But I must wait for daylight: I\u0027m not generally afeared, but there is some things, you know, which a body would as lief not do by night, with cracks and creaks all around you, which you don\u0027t seem to hear at other times.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52739.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
