{"id":16279,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. PRESENTIMENTS.","content":"The autumn lapsed into winter, and the household on the Asten farm began to share the isolation of the season. There had been friendly visits from all the nearest neighbors and friends, followed by return visits, and invitations which Julia willingly accepted. She was very amiable, and took pains to confirm the favorable impression which she knew she had made in the summer. Everybody remarked how she had improved in appearance, how round and soft her neck and shoulders, how bright and fresh her complexion. She thanked them, with many grateful expressions to which they were not accustomed, for their friendly reception, which she looked upon as an adoption into their society; but at home, afterwards, she indulged in criticisms of their manners and habits which were not always friendly. Although these were given in a light, playful tone, and it was sometimes impossible not to be amused, Rachel Miller always felt uncomfortable when she heard them. \n \n Then came quiet, lonely days, and Julia, weary of her idle life, undertook to master the details of the housekeeping. She went from garret to cellar, inspecting every article in closet and pantry, wondering much, censuring occasionally, and only praising a little when she found that Rachel was growing tired and irritable. Although she made no material changes, it was soon evident that she had very stubborn views of her own upon many points, and possessed a marked tendency for what the country people call \"nearness.\" Little by little she diminished the bountiful, free-handed manner of provision which had been the habit of the house. One could not say that anything needful was lacking, and Rachel would hardly have been dissatisfied, had she not felt that the innovation was an indirect blame. \n \n In some directions Julia seemed the reverse of \"near,\" persuading Joseph into expenditures which the people considered very extravagant. When the snow came, his new and elegant sleigh, with the wolf-skin robe, the silver-mounted harness, and the silver-sounding bells, was the envy of all the young men, and an abomination to the old. It was a splendor which he could easily afford, and he did not grudge her the pleasure; yet it seemed to change his relation to the neighbors, and some of them were very free in hinting that they felt it so. It would be difficult to explain why they should resent this or any other slight departure from their fashions, but such had always been their custom. \n \n In a few days the snow vanished and a tiresome season of rain and thaw succeeded. The south-eastern winds, blowing from the Atlantic across the intervening lowlands, rolled interminable gray masses of fog over the hills and blurred the scenery of the valley; dripping trees, soaked meadows, and sodden leaves were the only objects that detached themselves from the general void, and became in turn visible to those who travelled the deep, quaking roads. The social intercourse of the neighborhood ceased perforce, though the need of it were never so great: what little of the main highway down the valley was visible from the windows appeared to be deserted. \n \n Julia, having exhausted the resources of the house, insisted on acquainting herself with the barn and everything thereto belonging. She laughingly asserted that her education as a farmer\u0027s wife was still very incomplete; she must know the amount of the crops, the price of grain, the value of the stock, the manner of work, and whatever else was necessary to her position. Although she made many pretty blunders, it was evident that her apprehension was unusually quick, and that whatever she acquired was fixed in her mind as if for some possible future use. She never wearied of the most trivial details, while Joseph, on the other hand, would often have willingly shortened his lessons. His mind was singularly disturbed between the desire to be gratified by her curiosity, and the fact that its eager and persistent character made him uncomfortable. \n \n When an innocent, confiding nature begins to suspect that its confidence has been misplaced, the first result is a preternatural stubbornness to admit the truth. The clearest impressions are resisted, or half-consciously misinterpreted, with the last force of an illusion which already foresees its own overthrow. Joseph eagerly clung to every look and word and action which confirmed his sliding faith in his wife\u0027s sweet and simple character, and repelled—though a deeper instinct told him that a day would come when it must be admitted—the evidence of her coldness and selfishness. Yet, even while almost fiercely asserting to his own heart that he had every reason to be happy, he was consumed with a secret fever of unrest, doubt, and dread. \n \n The horns of the growing moon were still turned downwards, and cold, dreary rains were poured upon the land. Julia\u0027s patience, in such straits, was wonderful, if the truth had been known, but she saw that some change was necessary for both of them. She therefore proposed, not what she most desired, but what her circumstances prescribed,—a visit from her sister Clementina. Joseph found the request natural enough: it was an infliction, but one which he had anticipated; and after the time had been arranged by letter, he drove to the station to meet the westward train from the city. \n \n Clementina stepped upon the platform, so cloaked and hooded that he only recognized her by the deliberate grace of her movements. She extended her hand, giving his a cordial pressure, which was explained by the brass baggage-checks thus transferred to his charge. \n \n \"I will wait in the ladies\u0027 room,\" was all she said. \n \n At the same moment Joseph\u0027s arm was grasped. \n \n \"What a lucky chance!\" exclaimed Philip: then, suddenly pausing in his greeting, he lifted his hat and bowed to Clementina, who nodded slightly as she passed into the room. \n \n \"Let me look at you!\" Philip resumed, laying his hands on Joseph\u0027s shoulders. Their eyes met and lingered, and Joseph felt the blood rise to his face as Philip\u0027s gaze sank more deeply into his heart and seemed to fathom its hidden trouble; but presently Philip smiled and said: \"I scarcely knew, until this moment, that I had missed you so much, Joseph!\" \n \n \"Have you come to stay?\" Joseph asked. \n \n \"I think so. The branch railway down the valley, which you know was projected, is to be built immediately; but there are other reasons why the furnaces should be in blast. If it is possible, the work—and my settlement with it—will begin without any further delay. Is she your first family visit?\" \n \n He pointed towards the station. \n \n \"She will be with us a fortnight; but you will come, Philip?\" \n \n \"To be sure!\" Philip exclaimed. \"I only saw her face indistinctly through the veil, but her nod said to me, \u0027A nearer approach is not objectionable.\u0027 Certainly, Miss Blessing; but with all the conventional forms, if you please!\" \n \n There was something of scorn and bitterness in the laugh which accompanied these words, and Joseph looked at him with a puzzled air. \n \n \"You may as well know now,\" Philip whispered, \"that when I was a spoony youth of twenty, I very nearly imagined myself in love with Miss Clementina Blessing, and she encouraged my greenness until it spread as fast as a bamboo or a gourd-vine. Of course, I\u0027ve long since congratulated myself that she cut me up, root and branch, when our family fortune was lost. The awkwardness of our intercourse is all on her side. Can she still have faith in her charms and my youth, I wonder? Ye gods! that would be a lovely conclusion of the comedy!\" \n \n Joseph could only join in the laugh as they parted. There was no time to reflect upon what had been said. Clementina, nevertheless, assumed a new interest in his eyes; and as he drove her towards the farm, he could not avoid connecting her with Philip in his thoughts. She, too, was evidently preoccupied with the meeting, for Philip\u0027s name soon floated to the surface of their conversation. \n \n \"I expect a visit from him soon,\" said Joseph. As she was silent, he ventured to add: \"You have no objections to meeting with him, I suppose?\" \n \n \"Mr. Held is still a gentleman, I believe,\" Clementina replied, and then changed the subject of conversation. \n \n Julia flew at her sister with open arms, and showered on her a profusion of kisses, all of which were received with perfect serenity, Clementina merely saying, as soon as she could get breath: \"Dear me, Julia, I scarcely recognize you! You are already so countrified!\" \n \n Rachel Miller, although a woman, and notwithstanding her recent experience, found herself greatly bewildered by this new apparition. Clementina\u0027s slow, deliberate movements and her even-toned, musical utterance impressed her with a certain respect; yet the qualities of character they suggested never manifested themselves. On the contrary, the same words, in any other mouth, would have often expressed malice or heartlessness. Sometimes she heard her own homely phrases repeated, as if by the most unconscious purposeless imitation, and had Julia either smiled or appeared annoyed her suspicions might have been excited; as it was, she was constantly and sorely puzzled. \n \n Once only, and for a moment, the two masks were slightly lifted. At dinner, Clementina, who had turned the conversation upon the subject of birthdays, suddenly said to Joseph: \"By the way, Mr. Asten, has Julia told you her age?\" \n \n Julia gave a little start, but presently looked up, with an expression meant to be artless. \n \n \"I knew it before we were married,\" Joseph quietly answered. \n \n Clementina bit her lip. Julia, concealing her surprise, flashed a triumphant glance at her sister, then a tender one at Joseph, and said: \"We will both let the old birthdays go; we will only have one and the same anniversary from this time on!\" \n \n Joseph felt, through some natural magnetism of his nature rather than from any perceptible evidence, that Clementina was sharply and curiously watching the relation between himself and his wife. He had no fear of her detecting misgivings which were not yet acknowledged to himself, but was instinctively on his guard in her presence. \n \n It was not many days before Philip called. Julia received him cordially, as the friend of her husband, while Clementina bowed with an impassive face, without rising from her seat. Philip, however, crossed the room and gave her his hand, saying cheerily: \"We used to be old friends, Miss Blessing. You have not forgotten me?\" \n \n \"We cannot forget when we have been asked to do so,\" she warbled. \n \n Philip took a chair. \"Eight years!\" he said: \"I am the only one who has changed in that time.\" \n \n Julia, looked at her sister, but the latter was apparently absorbed in comparing some zephyr tints. \n \n \"The whirligig of time!\" he exclaimed: \"who can foresee anything? Then I was an ignorant, petted young aristocrat,—an expectant heir; now behold me, working among miners and puddlers and forgemen! It\u0027s a rough but wholesome change. Would you believe it, Mrs. Asten, I\u0027ve forgotten the mazurka!\" \n \n \"I wish to forget it,\" Julia replied: \"the spring-house is as important to me as the furnace to you.\" \n \n \"Have you seen the Hopetons lately?\" Clementina asked. \n \n Joseph saw a shade pass over Philip\u0027s face, and he seemed to hesitate a moment before answering: \"I hear they will be neighbors of mine next summer. Mr. Hopeton is interested in the new branch down the valley, and has purchased the old Calvert property for a country residence.\" \n \n \"Indeed? Then you will often see them.\" \n \n \"I hope so: they are very agreeable people. But I shall also have my own little household: my sister will probably join me.\" \n \n \"Not Madeline!\" exclaimed Julia. \n \n \"Madeline,\" Philip answered. \"It has long been her wish, as well as mine. You know the little cottage on the knoll, at Coventry, Joseph! I have taken it for a year.\" \n \n \"There will be quite a city society,\" murmured Clementina, in her sweetest tones. \"You will need no commiseration, Julia. Unless, indeed, the country people succeed in changing you all into their own likeness. Mrs. Hopeton will certainly create a sensation. I am told that she is very extravagant, Mr. Held?\" \n \n \"I have never seen her husband\u0027s bank account,\" said Philip, dryly. \n \n He rose presently, and Joseph accompanied him to the lane. Philip, with the bridle-rein over his arm, delayed to mount his horse, while the mechanical commonplaces of speech, which, somehow, always absurdly come to the lips when graver interests have possession of the heart, were exchanged by the two. Joseph felt, rather than saw, that Philip was troubled. Presently the latter said: \"Something is coming over both of us,—not between us. I thought I should tell you a little more, but perhaps it is too soon. If I guess rightly, neither of us is ready. Only this, Joseph, let us each think of the other as a help and a support!\" \n \n \"I do, Philip!\" Joseph answered. \"I see there is some influence at work which I do not understand, but I am not impatient to know what it is. As for myself, I seem to know nothing at all; but you can judge,—you see all there is.\" \n \n Even as he pronounced these words Joseph felt that they were not strictly sincere, and almost expected to find an expression of reproof in Philip\u0027s eyes. But no: they softened until he only saw a pitying tenderness. Then he knew that the doubts which he had resisted with all the force of his nature were clearly revealed to Philip\u0027s mind. \n \n They shook bands, and parted in silence; and Joseph, as he looked up to the gray blank of heaven, asked himself: \"Is this all? Has my life already taken the permanent imprint of its future?\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52726.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
