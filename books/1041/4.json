{"id":16270,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. MISS BLESSING CALLS ON RACHEL MILLER.","content":"On the following Saturday afternoon, Rachel Miller sat at the front window of the sitting-room, and arranged her light task of sewing and darning, with a feeling of unusual comfort. The household work of the week was over; the weather was fine and warm, with a brisk drying breeze for the hay on the hill-field, the last load of which Joseph expected to have in the barn before his five o\u0027clock supper was ready. As she looked down the valley, she noticed that the mowers were still swinging their way through Hunter\u0027s grass, and that Cunningham\u0027s corn sorely needed working. There was a different state of things on the Asten place. Everything was done, and well done, up to the front of the season. The weather had been fortunate, it was true; but Joseph had urged on the work with a different spirit. It seemed to her that he had taken a new interest in the farm; he was here and there, even inspecting with his own eyes the minor duties which had been formerly intrusted to his man Dennis. How could she know that this activity was the only outlet for a restless heart? \n \n If any evil should come of his social recreation, she had done her duty; but no evil seemed likely. She had always separated his legal from his moral independence; there was no enactment establishing the period when the latter commenced, and it could not be made manifest by documents, like the former. She would have admitted, certainly, that her guardianship must cease at some time, but the thought of making preparation for that time had never entered her head. She only understood conditions, not the adaptation of characters to them. Going back over her own life, she could recall but little difference between the girl of eighteen and the woman of thirty. There was the same place in her home, the same duties, the same subjection to the will of her parents—no exercise of independence or self-reliance anywhere, and no growth of those virtues beyond what a passive maturity brought with it. \n \n Even now she thought very little about any question of life in connection with Joseph. Her parents had trained her in the discipline of a rigid sect, and she could not dissociate the idea of morality from that of solemn renunciation. She could not say that social pleasures were positively wrong, but they always seemed to her to be enjoyed on the outside of an open door labelled \"Temptation;\" and who could tell what lay beyond? Some very good people, she knew, were fond of company, and made merry in an innocent fashion; they were of mature years and settled characters, and Joseph was only a boy. The danger, however, was not so imminent: no fault could be found with his attention to duty, and a chance so easily escaped was a comfortable guaranty for the future. \n \n In the midst of this mood (we can hardly say train of thought), she detected the top of a carriage through the bushes fringing the lane. The vehicle presently came into view: Anna Warriner was driving, and there were two other ladies on the back seat. As they drew up at the hitching-post on the green, she recognized Lucy Henderson getting out; but the airy creature who sprang after her,—the girl with dark, falling ringlets,—could it be the stranger from town? The plain, country-made gingham dress, the sober linen collar, the work-bag on her arm—could they belong to the stylish young lady whose acquaintance had turned Anna\u0027s head? \n \n A proper spirit of hospitality required her to meet the visitors at the gate; so there was no time left for conjecture. She was a little confused, but not dissatisfied at the chance of seeing the stranger. \n \n \"We thought we could come for an hour this afternoon, without disturbing you,\" said Anna Warriner. \"Mother has lost your receipt for pickling cherries, and Bob said you were already through with the hay-harvest; and so we brought Julia along—this is Julia Blessing.\" \n \n \"How do you do?\" said Miss Blessing, timidly extending her hand, and slightly dropping her eyelids. She then fell behind Anna and Lucy, and spoke no more until they were all seated in the sitting-room. \n \n \"How do you like the country by this time?\" Rachel asked, feeling that a little attention was necessary to a new guest. \n \n \"So well that I think I shall never like the city again,\" Miss Blessing answered. \"This quiet, peaceful life is such a rest; and I really never before knew what order was, and industry, and economy.\" \n \n She looked around the room as she spoke, and glanced at the barn through the eastern window. \n \n \"Yes, your ways in town are very different,\" Rachel remarked. \n \n \"It seems to me, now, that they are entirely artificial. I find myself so ignorant of the proper way of living that I should be embarrassed among you, if you were not all so very kind. But I am trying to learn a little.\" \n \n \"O, we don\u0027t expect too much of town\u0027s-folks,\" said Rachel, in a much more friendly tone, \"and we\u0027re always glad to see them willing to put up with our ways. But not many are.\" \n \n \"Please don\u0027t count me among those!\" Miss Blessing exclaimed. \n \n \"No, indeed, Miss Rachel!\" said Anna Warriner; \"you\u0027d be surprised to know how Julia gets along with everything—don\u0027t she, Lucy?\" \n \n \"Yes, she\u0027s very quick,\" Lucy Henderson replied. \n \n Miss Blessing cast down her eyes, smiled, and shook her head. \n \n Rachel Miller asked some questions which opened the sluices of Miss Warriner\u0027s gossip—and she had a good store of it. The ways and doings of various individuals were discussed, and Miss Blessing\u0027s occasional remarks showed a complete familiarity with them. Her manner was grave and attentive, and Rachel was surprised to find so much unobtrusive good sense in her views. The reality was so different from her previously assumed impression, that she felt bound to make some reparation. Almost before she was aware of it, her manner became wholly friendly and pleasant. \n \n \"May I look at your trees and flowers?\" Miss Blessing asked, when the gossip had been pretty well exhausted. \n \n They all arose and went out on the lawn. Rose and woodbine, phlox and verbena, passed under review, and then the long, rounded walls of box attracted Miss Blessing\u0027s eye. This was a feature of the place in which Rachel Miller felt considerable pride, and she led the way through the garden gate. Anna Warriner, however, paused, and said:— \n \n \"Lucy, let us go down to the spring-house. We can get back again before Julia has half finished her raptures.\" \n \n Lucy hesitated a moment. She looked at Miss Blessing, who laughed and said, \"O, don\u0027t mind me!\" as she took her place at Rachel\u0027s side. \n \n The avenue of box ran the whole length of the garden, which sloped gently to the south. At the bottom the green walls curved outward, forming three-fourths of a circle, spacious enough to contain several seats. There was a delightful view of the valley through the opening. \n \n \"The loveliest place I ever saw!\" exclaimed Miss Blessing, taking one of the rustic chairs. \"How pleasant it must be, when you have all your neighbors here together!\" \n \n Rachel Miller was a little startled; but before she could reply, Miss Blessing continued:— \n \n \"There is such a difference between a company of young people here in the country, and what is called \u0027a party\u0027 in the city. There it is all dress and flirtation and vanity, but here it is only neighborly visiting on a larger scale. I have enjoyed the quiet company of all your folks so much the more, because I felt that it was so very innocent. Indeed, I don\u0027t see how anybody could be led into harmful ways here.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Rachel: \"we must learn to mistrust our own hearts.\" \n \n \"You are right! The best are weak—of themselves; but there is more safety where all have been brought up unacquainted with temptation. Now, you will perhaps wonder at me when I say that I could trust the young men—for instance, Mr. Asten, your nephew—as if they were my brothers. That is, I feel a positive certainty of their excellent character. What they say they mean: it is otherwise in the city. It is delightful to see them all together, like members of one family. You must enjoy it, I should think, when they meet here.\" \n \n Rachel Miller\u0027s eyes opened wide, and there was both a puzzled and a searching expression in the look she gave Miss Blessing. The latter, with an air of almost infantine simplicity, her lips slightly parted, accepted the scrutiny with a quiet cheerfulness which seemed the perfection of candor. \n \n \"The truth is,\" said Rachel, slowly, \"this is a new thing. I hope the merry-makings are as innocent as you think; but I\u0027m afraid they unsettle the young people, after all.\" \n \n \"Do you, really?\" exclaimed Miss Blessing. \"What have you seen in them which leads you to think so? But no—never mind my question; you may have reasons which I have no right to ask. Now, I remember Mr. Asten telling Anna and Lucy and myself, how much he should like to invite his friends here, if it were not for a duty which prevented it; and a duty, he said, was more important to him than a pleasure.\" \n \n \"Did Joseph say that?\" Rachel exclaimed. \n \n \"O, perhaps I oughtn\u0027t to have told it,\" said Miss Blessing, casting down her eyes and blushing in confusion: \"in that case, please don\u0027t say anything about it! Perhaps it was a duty towards you, for he told me that he looked upon you as a second mother.\" \n \n Rachel\u0027s eyes softened, and it was a little while before she spoke. \"I\u0027ve tried to do my duty by him,\" she faltered at last, \"but it sometimes seems an unthankful business, and I can\u0027t always tell how he takes it. And so he wanted to have a company here?\" \n \n \"I am so sorry I said it!\" cried Miss Blessing. \"I never thought you were opposed to company, on principle. Miss Chaffinch, the minister\u0027s daughter, you know, was there the last time; and, really, if you could see it—But it is presumptuous in me to say anything. Indeed, I am not a fair judge, because these little gatherings have enabled me to make such pleasant acquaintances. And the young men tell me that they work all the better after them.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s only on his account,\" said Rachel. \n \n \"Nay, I\u0027m sure that the last thing Mr. Asten would wish would be your giving up a principle for his sake! I know, from his face, that his own character is founded on principle. And, besides, here in the country, you don\u0027t keep count of hospitality, as they do in the city, and feel obliged to return as much as you receive. So, if you will try to forget what I have said—\" \n \n Rachel interrupted her. \"I meant something different. Joseph knows why I objected to parties. He must not feel under obligations which I stand in the way of his repaying. If he tells me that he should like to invite his friends to this place, I will help him to entertain them.\" \n \n \"You are his second mother, indeed,\" Miss Blessing murmured, looking at her with a fond admiration. \"And now I can hope that you will forgive my thoughtlessness. I should feel humiliated in his presence, if he knew that I had repeated his words. But he will not ask you, and this is the end of any harm I may have done.\" \n \n \"No,\" said Rachel, \"he will not ask me; but won\u0027t I be an offence in his mind?\" \n \n \"I can understand how you feel—only a woman can judge a woman\u0027s heart. Would you think me too forward if I tell you what might be done, this once?\" \n \n She stole softly up to Rachel as she spoke, and laid her hand gently upon her arm. \n \n \"Perhaps I am wrong—but if you were first to suggest to your nephew that if he wished to make some return for the hospitality of his neighbors,—or put it in whatever form you think best,—would not that remove the \u0027offence\u0027 (though he surely cannot look at it in that light), and make him grateful and happy?\" \n \n \"Well,\" said Rachel, after a little reflection, \"if anything is done, that would be as good a way as any.\" \n \n \"And, of course, you won\u0027t mention me?\" \n \n \"There is no call to do it—as I can see.\" \n \n \"Julia, dear!\" cried Anna from the gate; \"come and see the last load of hay hauled into the barn!\" \n \n \"I should like to see it, if you will excuse me,\" said Miss Blessing to Rachel; \"I have taken quite an interest in farming.\" \n \n As they were passing the porch, Rachel paused on the step and said to Anna: \"You\u0027ll bide and get your suppers?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Anna replied: \"we didn\u0027t mean to; but we stayed longer than we intended—\" \n \n \"Then you can easily stay longer still.\" \n \n There was nothing unfriendly in Rachel\u0027s blunt manner. Anna laughed, took Miss Blessing by the arm, and started for the barn. Lucy Henderson quietly turned and entered the house, where, without any offer of services, she began to assist in arranging the table. \n \n The two young ladies took their stand on the green, at a safe distance, as the huge fragrant load approached. The hay overhung and concealed the wheels, as well as the hind quarters of the oxen, and on the summit stood Joseph, in his shirt-sleeves and leaning on a pitch-fork. He bent forward as he saw them, answering their greetings with an eager, surprised face. \n \n \"O, take care, take care!\" cried Miss Blessing, as the load entered the barn-door; but Joseph had already dropped upon his knees and bent his shoulders. Then the wagon stood upon the barn-floor; he sprang lightly upon a beam, descended the upright ladder, and the next moment was shaking hands with them. \n \n \"We have kept our promise, you see,\" said Miss Blessing. \n \n \"Have you been in the house yet?\" Joseph asked, looking at Anna. \n \n \"O, for an hour past, and we are going to take supper with you.\" \n \n \"Dennis!\" cried Joseph, turning towards the barn, \"we will let the load stand to-night.\" \n \n \"How much better a man looks in shirt-sleeves than in a dress-coat!\" remarked Miss Blessing aside to Anna Warriner, but not in so low a tone as to prevent Joseph from hearing it. \n \n \"Why, Julia, you are perfectly countrified! I never saw anything like it!\" Anna replied. \n \n Joseph turned to them again, with a bright flush on his face. He caught Miss Blessing\u0027s eyes, full of admiration, before the lids fell modestly over them. \n \n \"So you\u0027ve seen my home, already?\" he said, as they walked slowly towards the house. \n \n \"O, not the half yet!\" she answered, in a low, earnest tone. \"A place so lovely and quiet as this cannot be appreciated at once. I almost wish I had not seen it: what shall I do when I must go back to the hot pavements, and the glaring bricks, and the dust, and the hollow, artificial life?\" She tried to check a sigh, but only partially succeeded; then, with a sudden effort, she laughed lightly, and added: \"I wonder if everybody doesn\u0027t long for something else? Now, Anna, here, would think it heavenly to change places with me.\" \n \n \"Such privileges as you have!\" Anna protested. \n \n \"Privileges?\" Miss Blessing echoed. \"The privilege of hearing scandal, of being judged by your dress, of learning the forms and manners, instead of the good qualities, of men and women? No! give me an independent life.\" \n \n \"Alone?\" suggested Miss Warriner. \n \n Joseph looked at Miss Blessing, who made no reply. Her head was turned aside, and he could well understand that she must feel hurt at Anna\u0027s indelicacy. \n \n In the house Rachel Miller and Lucy had, in the mean time, been occupied with domestic matters. The former, however, was so shaken out of her usual calm by the conversation in the garden, that in spite of prudent resolves to keep quiet, she could not restrain herself from asking a question or two. \n \n \"Lucy,\" said she, \"how do you find these evening parties you\u0027ve been attending?\" \n \n \"They are lively and pleasant,—at least every one says so.\" \n \n \"Are you going to have any more?\" \n \n \"It seems to be the wish,\" said Lucy, suddenly hesitating, as she found Rachel\u0027s eyes intently fixed upon her face. \n \n The latter was silent for a minute, arranging the tea-service; but she presently asked again: \"Do you think Joseph would like to invite the young people here?\" \n \n \"She has told you!\" Lucy exclaimed, in unfeigned irritation. \"Miss Rachel, don\u0027t let it trouble you a moment: nobody expects it of you!\" \n \n Lucy felt, immediately, that her expression had been too frankly positive; but even the consciousness thereof did not enable her to comprehend its effect. \n \n Rachel straightened herself a little, and said \"Indeed?\" in anything but an amiable tone. She went to the cupboard and returned before speaking again. \"I didn\u0027t say anybody told me,\" she continued; \"it\u0027s likely that Joseph might think of it, and I don\u0027t see why people should expect me to stand in the way of his wishes.\" \n \n Lucy was so astonished that she could not immediately reply; and the entrance of Joseph and the two ladies cut off all further opportunity of clearing up what she felt to be an awkward misunderstanding. \n \n \"I must help, too!\" cried Miss Blessing, skipping into the kitchen after Rachel. \"That is one thing, at least, which we can learn in the city. Indeed, if it wasn\u0027t for housekeeping, I should feel terribly useless.\" \n \n Rachel protested against her help, but in vain. Miss Blessing had a laugh and a lively answer for every remonstrance, and flitted about in a manner which conveyed the impression that she was doing a great deal. \n \n Joseph could scarcely believe his eyes, when he came down from his room in fresh attire, and beheld his aunt not only so assisted, but seeming to enjoy it. Lucy, who appeared to be ill at ease, had withdrawn from the table, and was sitting silently beside the window. Recalling their conversation a few evenings before, he suspected that she might be transiently annoyed on his aunt\u0027s account; she had less confidence, perhaps, in Miss Blessing\u0027s winning, natural manners. So Lucy\u0027s silence threw no shadow upon his cheerfulness: he had never felt so happy, so free, so delighted to assume the character of a host. \n \n After the first solemnity which followed the taking of seats at the table, the meal proceeded with less than the usual decorum. Joseph, indeed, so far forgot his duties, that his aunt was obliged to remind him of them from time to time. Miss Blessing was enthusiastic over the cream and butter and marmalade, and Rachel Miller found it exceedingly pleasant to have her handiwork appreciated. Although she always did her best, for Joseph\u0027s sake, she knew that men have very ignorant, indifferent tastes in such matters. \n \n When the meal was over, Anna Warriner said: \"We are going to take Lucy on her way as far as the cross-roads; so there will not be more than time to get home by sunset.\" \n \n Before the carriage was ready, however, another vehicle drove up the lane. Elwood Withers jumped out, gave Joseph a hearty grip of his powerful hand, greeted the others rapidly, and then addressed himself specially to Lucy: \"I was going to a township-meeting at the Corner,\" said he; \"but Bob Warriner told me you were here with Anna, so I thought I could save her a roundabout drive by taking you myself.\" \n \n \"Thank you; but I\u0027m sorry you should go so far out of your road,\" said Lucy. Her face was pale, and there was an evident constraint in the smile which accompanied the words. \n \n \"O, he\u0027d go twice as far for company,\" Anna Warriner remarked. \"You know I\u0027d take you, and welcome, but Elwood has a good claim on you, now.\" \n \n \"I have no claim, Lucy,\" said Elwood, rather doggedly. \n \n \"Let us go, then,\" were Lucy\u0027s words. \n \n She rose, and the four were soon seated in the two vehicles. They drove away in the low sunshine, one pair chatting and laughing merrily as long as they were within hearing, the other singularly grave and silent. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52717.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
