{"id":16291,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. THE MOURNERS.","content":"\"It cannot be!\" cried Joseph, looking at the doctor with an agonized face; \"it is too dreadful!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is no room for doubt in relation to the cause. I suspect that her nervous system has been subjected to a steady and severe tension, probably for years past. This may have induced a condition, or at least a temporary paroxysm, during which she was—you understand me—not wholly responsible for her actions. You must have noticed whether such a condition preceded this catastrophe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucy looked from one to the other, and back to the livid face on the pillow, unable to ask a question, and not yet comprehending that the end had come. Joseph arose at the doctor\u0027s words. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is my guilt,\" he said. \"I was excited and angry, for I had been bitterly deceived. I warned her that her life must henceforth conform to mine: my words were harsh and violent. I told her that we had at last ascertained each other\u0027s true natures, and proposed a serious discussion for the purpose of arranging our common future, this afternoon. Can she have misunderstood my meaning? It was not separation, not divorce: I only meant to avoid the miserable strife of the last few weeks. Who could imagine that this would follow?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Even as he spoke the words Joseph remembered the tempting fancy which had passed through his own mind,—and the fear of Philip,—as he stood on the brink of the rock, above the dark, sliding water. He covered his face with his hands and sat down. What right had he to condemn her, to pronounce her mad? Grant that she had been blinded by her own unbalanced, excitable nature rather than consciously false; grant that she had really loved him, that the love survived under all her vain and masterful ambition,—and how could he doubt it after the dying words and looks?—it was then easy to guess how sorely she had been wounded, how despair should follow her fierce excitement! Her words, \"Go away! you have killed me!\" were now explained. He groaned in the bitterness of his self-accusation. What were all the trials he had endured to this? How light seemed the burden from which he was now free! how gladly would he bear it, if the day\u0027s words and deeds could be unsaid and undone! \\n\\n \\n\\n Tho doctor, meanwhile, had explained the manner of Julia\u0027s death to Lucy Henderson. She, almost overcome with this last horror, could only agree with his conjecture, for her own evidence confirmed it. Joseph had forborne to mention her presence in the garden, and she saw no need of repeating his words to her; but she described Julia\u0027s convulsive excitement, and her refusal to admit her to her room, half an hour before the first attack of the poison. The case seemed entirely clear to both. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For the present,\" said the doctor, \"let us say nothing about the suicide. There is no necessity for a post-mortem examination: the symptoms, and the presence of arsenic in the glass, are quite sufficient to establish the cause of death. You know what a foolish idea of disgrace is attached to families here in the country when such a thing happens, and Mr. Asten is not now in a state to bear much more. At least, we must save him from painful questions until after the funeral is over. Say as little as possible to him: he is not in a condition to listen to reason: he believes himself guilty of her death.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What shall I do?\" cried Lucy: \"will you not stay until the man Dennis returns? Mr. Asten\u0027s aunt must be fetched immediately.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not a quarter of an hour before Dennis arrived, followed by Philip and Madeline Held. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucy, who had already despatched Dennis, with a fresh horse, to Magnolia, took Philip and Madeline into the dining-room, and hurriedly communicated to them the intelligence of Julia\u0027s death. Philip\u0027s heart gave a single leap of joy; then he compelled himself to think of Joseph and the exigencies of the situation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You cannot stay here alone,\" he said. \"Madeline must keep you company. I will go up and take care of Joseph: we must think of both the living and the dead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n No face could have been half so comforting in the chamber of death as Philip\u0027s. The physician had, in the mean time, repeated to Joseph the words he had spoken to Lucy, and now Joseph said, pointing to Philip, \"Tell him everything!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip, startled as he was, at once comprehended the situation. He begged Dr. Hartman to leave all further arrangements to him, and to summon Mrs. Bishop, the wife of one of Joseph\u0027s near neighbors, on his way home. Then, taking Joseph by the arm, he said:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now come with me. We will leave this room awhile to Lucy and Madeline; but neither must you be alone. If I am anything to you, Joseph, now is the time when my presence should be some slight comfort. We need not speak, but we will keep together.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph clung the closer to his friend\u0027s arm, without speaking, and they passed out of the house. Philip led him, mechanically, towards the garden, but as they drew near the avenue of box-trees Joseph started back, crying out:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not there!—O, not there!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip turned in silence, conducted him past the barn into the grass-field, and mounted the hill towards the pin-oak on its summit. From this point the house was scarcely visible behind the fir-trees and the huge weeping-willow, but the fair hills around seemed happy under the tender sky, and the melting, vapory distance, seen through the southern opening of the valley, hinted of still happier landscapes beyond. As Joseph contemplated the scene, the long strain upon his nerves relaxed: he leaned upon Philip\u0027s shoulder, as they sat side by side, and wept passionately. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If she had not died!\" he murmured, at last. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip was hardly prepared for this exclamation, and he did not immediately answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps it is better for me to talk,\" Joseph continued. \"You do not know the whole truth, Philip. You have heard of her madness, but not of my guilt. What was it I said when we last met? I cannot recall it now: but I know that I feared to call my punishment unjust. Since then I have deserved it all, and more. If I am a child, why should I dare to handle fire? If I do not understand life, why should I dare to set death in motion?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He began, and related everything that had passed since they parted on the banks of the stream. He repeated the words that had been spoken in the house and in the garden, and the last broken sentences that came from Julia\u0027s lips. Philip listened with breathless surprise and attention. The greater part of the narrative made itself clear to his mind; his instinctive knowledge of Julia\u0027s nature enabled him to read much further than was then possible to Joseph; but there was a mystery connected with the suicide which he could not fathom. Her rage he could easily understand; her apparent submission to Joseph\u0027s request, however,—her manifest desire to live, on overhearing the physician\u0027s fears,—her last incomplete sentence, \"I—did—not—mean—\" indicated no such fatal intention, but the reverse. Moreover, she was too inherently selfish, even in the fiercest paroxysm of disappointment, to take her own life, he believed. All the evidence justified him in this view of her nature, yet at the same time rendered her death more inexplicable. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was no time to mention these doubts to Joseph. His only duty was to console and encourage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is no guilt in accident,\" he said. \"It was a crisis which must have come, and you took the only course possible to a man. If she felt that she was defeated, and her mad act was the consequence, think of your fate had she felt herself victorious!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It could have been no worse than it was,\" Joseph answered. \"And she might have changed: I did not give her time. I have accused my own mistaken education, but I had no charity, no pity for hers!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When they descended the hill Mrs. Bishop had arrived, and the startled household was reduced to a kind of dreary order. Dennis, who had driven with speed, brought Rachel Miller at dusk, and Philip and Madeline then departed, taking Lucy Henderson with them. Rachel was tearful, but composed; she said little to her nephew, but there was a quiet, considerate tenderness in her manner which soothed him more than any words. \\n\\n \\n\\n The reaction from so much fatigue and excitement almost prostrated him. When he went to bed in his own guest-room, feeling like a stranger in a strange house, he lay for a long time between sleep and waking, haunted by all the scenes and personages of his past life. His mother\u0027s face, so faded in memory, came clear and fresh from the shadows; a boy whom he had loved in his school-days floated with fair, pale features just before his closed eyes; and around and between them there was woven a web of twilights and moonlights, and sweet sunny days, each linked to some grief or pleasure of the buried years. It was a keen, bitter joy, a fascinating torment, from which he could not escape. He was caught and helplessly ensnared by the phantoms, until, late in the night, the strong claim of nature drove them away and left him in a dead, motionless, dreamless slumber. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip returned in the morning, and devoted the day not less to the arrangements which must necessarily be made for the funeral than to standing between Joseph and the awkward and inquisitive sympathy of the neighbors. Joseph\u0027s continued weariness favored Philip\u0027s exertions, while at the same time it blunted the edge of his own feelings, and helped him over that cold, bewildering, dismal period, during which a corpse is lord of the mansion and controls the life of its inmates. \\n\\n \\n\\n Towards evening Mr. and Mrs. Blessing, who had been summoned by telegraph, made their appearance. Clementina did not accompany them. They were both dressed in mourning: Mrs. Blessing was grave and rigid, Mr. Blessing flushed and lachrymose. Philip conducted them first to the chamber of the dead and then to Joseph. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is so sudden, so shocking!\" Mrs. Blessing sobbed; \"and Julia always seemed so healthy! What have you done to her, Mr. Asten, that she should be cut off in the bloom of her youth?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eliza!\" exclaimed her husband, with his handkerchief to his eyes; \"do not say anything which might sound like a reproach to our heart-broken son! There are many foes in the citadel of life: they may be undermining our—our foundations at this very moment!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Joseph; \"you, her father and mother, must hear the truth. I would give all I have in the world if I were not obliged to tell it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was, at the best, a painful task; but it was made doubly so by exclamations, questions, intimations, which he was forced to hear. Finally, Mrs. Blessing asked, in a tone of alarm:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How many persons know of this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only the physician and three of my friends,\" Joseph answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They must be silent! It might ruin Clementina\u0027s prospects if it were generally known. To lose one daughter and to have the life of another blasted would be too much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eliza,\" said her husband, \"we must, try to accept whatever is inevitable. It seems to me that I no more recognize Julia\u0027s usually admirable intellect in her—yes, I must steel myself to say the word!—her suicide, than I recognized her features just now! unless Decay\u0027s effacing fingers have already swept the lines where beauty lingers. I warned her of the experiment, for such I felt it to be; yet in this last trying experience I do not complain of Joseph\u0027s disappointment, and his temporary—I trust it is only temporary—suspicion. We must not forget that he has lost more than we have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where is—\" Joseph began, endeavoring to turn the conversation from this point. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Clementina? I knew you would find her absence unaccountable. We instantly forwarded a telegram to Long Branch; the answer said, \u0027My grief is great, but it is quite impossible to come.\u0027 Why impossible she did not particularize, and we can only conjecture. When I consider her age and lost opportunities, and the importance which a single day, even a fortunate situation, may possess for her at present, it seems to remove some of the sharpness of the serpent\u0027s tooth. Neither she nor we are responsible for Julia\u0027s rash taking off; yet it is always felt as a cloud which lowers upon the family. There was a similar case among the De Belsains, during the Huguenot times, but we never mention it. For your sake silence is rigidly imposed upon us; since the preliminary—what shall I call it?—dis-harmony of views?—would probably become a part of the narrative.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pray do not speak of that now!\" Joseph groaned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pardon me; I will not do so again. Our minds naturally become discursive under the pressure of grief. It is easier for me to talk at such times than to be silent and think. My power of recuperation seems to be spiritual as well as physical; it is congenital, and therefore exposes me to misconceptions. But we can close over the great abyss of our sorrow, and hide it from view in the depth of our natures, without dancing on the platform which covers it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip turned away to hide a smile, and even Mrs. Blessing exclaimed: \"Really, Benjamin, you are talking heartlessly!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not mean it so,\" he said, melting into tears, \"but so much has come upon me all at once! If I lose my buoyancy, I shall go to the bottom like a foundered ship! I was never cut out for the tragic parts of life; but there are characters who smile on the stage and weep behind the scenes. And, you know, the Lord loveth a cheerful giver.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was so touched by the last words he spoke, that he leaned his head upon his arms and wept bitterly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Mrs. Blessing, weeping also, exclaimed: \"O, don\u0027t take on so, Benjamin!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip put an end to the scene, which was fast becoming a torment to Joseph. But, later in the evening, Mr. Blessing again sought the latter, softly apologizing for the intrusion, but declaring that he was compelled, then and there, to make a slight explanation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When you called the other evening,\" he said, \"I was worn out, and not competent to grapple with such an unexpected revelation of villainy. I had been as ignorant of Kanuck\u0027s real character as you were. All our experience of the world is sometimes at fault; but where the Reverend Dr. Lellifant was first deceived, my own case does not seem so flagrant. Your early information, however, enabled me (through third parties) to secure a partial sale of the stock held by yourself and me,—at something of a sacrifice, it is true; but I prefer not to dissociate myself entirely from the enterprise. I do not pretend to be more than the merest tyro in geology; nevertheless, as I lay awake last night,—being, of course, unable to sleep after the shock of the telegram,—I sought relief in random scientific fancies. It occurred to mo that since the main Chowder wells are \u0027spouting,\u0027 their source or reservoir must be considerably higher than the surface. Why might not that source be found under the hills of the Amaranth? If so, the Chowder would be tapped at the fountain-head and the flow of Pactolean grease would be ours! When I return to the city I shall need instantly—after the fearful revelations of to-day—some violently absorbing occupation; and what could be more appropriate? If anything could give repose to Julia\u0027s unhappy shade, it would be the knowledge that her faith in the Amaranth was at last justified! I do not presume to awaken your confidence: it has been too deeply shaken; all I ask is, that I may have the charge of your shares, in order—without calling upon you for the expenditure of another cent, you understand—to rig a jury-mast on the wreck, and, D. V., float safely into port!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should I refuse to trust you with what is already worthless?\" said Joseph. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will admit even that, if you desire. \u0027Exitus acta probat\u0027 was Washington\u0027s motto; but I don\u0027t consider that we have yet reached the exitus! Thank you, Joseph! Your question has hardly the air of returning confidence, but I will force myself to consider it as such, and my labor will be to deserve it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He wrung Joseph\u0027s hand, shed a few more tears, and betook himself to his wife\u0027s chamber. \"Eliza, let us be calm: we never know our strength until it has been tried,\" he said to her, as he opened his portmanteau and took from it the wicker-covered flask. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then came the weariest and dreariest day of all,—when the house must be thrown open to the world; when in one room the corpse must be displayed for solemn stares and whispered comments, while in another the preparation of the funeral meats absorbs all the interest of half a dozen busy women; when the nearest relatives of the dead sit together in a room up stairs, hungering only for the consolations of loneliness and silence; when all talk under their voices, and uncomfortably fulfil what they believe to be their solemn duty; and when even Nature is changed to all eyes, and the mysterious gloom of an eclipse seems to fall from the most unclouded sun. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a general gathering of the neighbors from far and near. The impression seemed to be—and Philip was ready to substantiate it—that Julia had died in consequence of a violent convulsive spasm, which some attributed to one cause and some to another. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Rev. Mr. Chaffinch made his way, as by right, to the chamber of the mourners. Rachel Miller was comforted in seeing him, Mr. and Mrs. Blessing sadly courteous, and Joseph strengthened himself to endure with patience what might follow. After a few introductory words, and a long prayer, the clergyman addressed himself to each, in turn, with questions or remarks which indicated a fierce necessity of resignation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I feel for you, brother,\" he said, as he reached Joseph and bent over his chair. \"It is an inscrutable visitation, but I trust you submit, in all obedience?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph bowed silently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has many ways of searching the heart,\" Mr. Chaffinch continued. \"Your one precious comfort must be that she believed, and that she is now in glory. O, if you would but resolve to follow in her footsteps! He shows His love, in that He chastens you: it is a stretching out of His hand, a visible offer of acceptance, this on one side, and the lesson of our perishing mortality on the other! Do you not feel your heart awfully and tenderly moved to approach Him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph sat, with bowed head, listening to the smooth, unctuous, dismal voice at his ear, until the tension of his nerves became a positive physical pain. He longed to cry aloud, to spring up and rush away; his heart was moved, but not awfully and tenderly. It had been yearning towards the pure Divine Light in which all confusions of the soul are disentangled; but now some opaque foreign substance intervened, and drove him back upon himself. How long the torture lasted he did not know. He spake no word, and made no further sign. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Philip took him and Rachel Miller down, for the last conventional look at the stony, sunken face. He was seated here and led there; he was dimly conscious of a crowd, of murmurs and steadfast faces; he heard some one whisper, \"How dreadfully pale he looks!\" and wondered whether the words could possibly refer to him. Then there was the welcome air and the sunshine, and Dennis driving them slowly down the lane, following a gloomy vehicle, in which something—not surely the Julia whom he knew—was carried. \\n\\n \\n\\n He recalled but one other such stupor of the senses: it was during the performance of the marriage ceremony. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the longest day wears out at last; and when night came only Philip was beside him. The Blessings had been sent to Oakland Station for the evening train to the city, and Joseph\u0027s shares in the Amaranth Company were in their portmanteau. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52738.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
