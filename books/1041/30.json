{"id":16296,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. MR. BLESSING\u0027S TESTIMONY.","content":"On entering the court-room Mr. Blessing had gone to Joseph, given his hand a long, significant grasp, and looked in his face with an expression of triumph, almost of exultation. The action was not lost upon the spectators or the jury, and even Joseph felt that it was intended to express the strongest faith in his innocence. \n \n When the name was called there was a movement in the crowd, and a temporary crush in some quarters, as the people thrust forward their heads to see and listen. Mr. Blessing, bland, dignified, serene, feeling that he was the central point of interest, waited until quiet had been restored, slightly turning his head to either side, as if to summon special attention to what he should say. \n \n After being sworn, and stating his name, he thus described his occupation:— \n \n \"I hold a position under government; nominally, it is a Deputy Inspectorship in the Custom-House, yet it possesses a confidential—I might say, if modesty did not prevent, an advisory—character.\" \n \n \"In other words, a Ward Politician!\" said Mr. Spenham. \n \n \"I must ask the prosecuting attorney,\" Mr. Blessing blandly suggested, \"not to define my place according to his own political experiences.\" \n \n There was a general smile at these words; and a very audible chuckle from spectators belonging to the opposite party. \n \n \"You are the father of the late Mrs. Julia Asten?\" \n \n \"I am—her unhappy father, whom nothing but the imperious commands of justice, and the knowledge of her husband\u0027s innocence of the crime with which he stands charged, could have compelled to appear here, and reveal the painful secrets of a family, which—\" \n \n Here Mr. Spenham interrupted him. \n \n \"I merely wish to observe,\" Mr. Blessing continued, with a stately wave of his hand towards the judge and jury, \"that the De Belsains and their descendants may have been frequently unfortunate, but were never dishonorable. I act in their spirit when I hold duty to the innocent living higher than consideration for the unfortunate dead.\" \n \n Here he drew forth a handkerchief, and held it for a moment to his eyes. \n \n \"Did you know of any domestic discords between your daughter and her husband?\" \n \n \"I foresaw that such might be, and took occasion to warn my daughter, on her wedding-day, not to be too sure of her influence. There was too much disparity of age, character, and experience. It could not be called crabbed age and rosy youth, but there was difference enough to justify Shakespeare\u0027s doubts. I am aware that the court requires ocular—or auricular—evidence. The only such I have to offer is my son-in-law\u0027s own account of the discord which preceded my daughter\u0027s death.\" \n \n \"Did this discord sufficiently explain to you the cause and manner of her death?\" \n \n \"My daughter\u0027s nature—I do not mean to digress, but am accustomed to state my views clearly—my daughter\u0027s nature was impulsive. She inherited my own intellect, but modified by the peculiar character of the feminine nervous system. Hence she might succumb to a depression which I should resist. She appeared to be sure of her control over my son-in-law\u0027s nature, and of success in an enterprise, in which—I regret to say—my son-in-law lost confidence. I assumed, at the time, that her usually capable mind was unbalanced by the double disappointment, and that she had rushed, unaneled, to her last account. This, I say, was the conclusion forced upon me; yet I cannot admit that it was satisfactory. It seemed to disparage my daughter\u0027s intellectual power: it was not the act which I should have anticipated in any possible emergency.\" \n \n \"Had you no suspicion that her husband might have been instrumental?\" Mr. Spenham asked. \n \n \"He? he is simply incapable of that, or any crime!\" \n \n \"We don\u0027t want assertions,\" said Mr. Spenham, sternly. \n \n \"I beg pardon of the court,\" remarked Mr. Blessing; \"it was a spontaneous expression. The touch of nature cannot always be avoided.\" \n \n \"Go on, sir!\" \n \n \"I need not describe the shock and sorrow following my daughter\u0027s death,\" Mr. Blessing continued, again applying his handkerchief. \"In order to dissipate it, I obtained a leave of absence from my post,—the exigencies of the government fortunately admitting of it,—and made a journey to the Oil Regions, in the interest of myself and my son-in-law. While there I received a letter from Mr. Philip Held, the contents of which—\" \n \n \"Will you produce the letter?\" Mr. Spenham exclaimed. \n \n \"It can be produced, if necessary. I will state nothing further, since I perceive that this would not be admissible evidence. It is enough to say that I returned to the city without delay, in order to meet Mr. Philip Held. The requirements of justice were more potent with me than the suggestions of personal interest. Mr. Held had already, as you will have noticed from his testimony, identified the fragment of paper as having emanated from the drug-store of Wallis and Erkers, corner of Fifth and Persimmon Streets. I accompanied him to that drug-store, heard the statements of the proprietors, in answer to Mr. Held\u0027s questions,—statements which, I confess, surprised me immeasurably (but I could not reject the natural deductions to be drawn from them), and was compelled, although it overwhelmed me with a sense of unmerited shame, to acknowledge that there was plausibility in Mr. Held\u0027s conjectures. Since they pointed to my elder daughter, Clementina, now Mrs. Spelter, and at this moment tossing upon the ocean-wave, I saw that Mr. Held might possess a discernment superior to my own. But for a lamentable cataclysm, he might have been my son-in-law, and I need not say that I prefer that refinement of character which comes of good blood to the possession of millions—\" \n \n Here Mr. Blessing was again interrupted, and ordered to confine himself to the simple statement of the necessary facts. \n \n \"I acknowledge the justice of the rebuke,\" he said. \"But the sentiment of the mens conscia recti will sometimes obtrude through the rigid formula of Themis. In short, Mr. Philip Held\u0027s representations—\" \n \n \"State those representations at once, and be done with them!\" Mr. Spenham cried. \n \n \"I am coming to them presently. The Honorable Court understands, I am convinced, that a coherent narrative, although moderately prolix, is preferable to a disjointed narrative, even if the latter were terse as Tacitus. Mr. Held\u0027s representations, I repeat, satisfied me that an interview with my daughter Clementina was imperative. There was no time to be lost, for the passage of the nuptial pair had already been taken in the Ville de Paris. I started at once, sending a telegram in advance, and in the same evening arrived at their palatial residence in Fifth Avenue. Clementina\u0027s nature, I must explain to the Honorable Court, is very different from that of her sister,—the reappearance, I suspect, of some lateral strain of blood. She is reticent, undemonstrative,—in short, frequently inscrutable. I suspected that a direct question might defeat my object; therefore, when I was alone with her the next morning,—my son-in-law, Mr. Spelter, being called to a meeting of Erie of which he is one of the directors,—I said to her: \u0027My child, you are perfectly blooming! Your complexion was always admirable, but now it seems to me incomparable!\u0027\" \n \n \"This is irrelevant!\" cried Mr. Spenham. \n \n \"By no means! It is the very corpus delicti,—the foot of Hercules,—the milk (powder would be more appropriate) in the cocoa-nut!\" Clementina smiled in her serene way, and made no reply. \u0027How do you keep it up now?\u0027 I asked, tapping her cheek; \u0027you must be careful, here: all persons are not so discreet as Wallis and Erkers.\u0027 She was astounded, stupefied, I might say, but I saw that I had reached the core of truth. \u0027Did you suppose I was ignorant of it?\u0027 I said, still very friendly and playfully. \u0027Then it was Julia who told you!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027And if she did,\u0027 I answered, \u0027what was the harm? I have no doubt that Julia did the same thing.\u0027 \u0027She was always foolish,\u0027 Clementina then said; \u0027she envied me my complexion, and she watched me until she found out. I told her that it would not do for any except blondes, like myself, and her complexion was neither one thing nor the other. And I couldn\u0027t see that it improved much, afterwards.\u0027\" \n \n Mr. Pinkerton saw that the jurymen were puzzled, and requested Mr. Blessing to explain the conversation to them. \n \n \"It is my painful duty to obey; yet a father\u0027s feelings may be pardoned if he shrinks from presenting the facts at once in their naked—unpleasantness. However, since the use of arsenic as a cosmetic is so general in our city, especially among blondes, as Wallis and Erkers assure me, my own family is not an isolated case. Julia commenced using the drug, so Clementina informed me, after her engagement with Mr. Asten, and only a short time before her marriage. To what extent she used it, after that event, I have no means of knowing; but, I suspect, less frequently, unless she feared that the disparity of age between her and her husband was becoming more apparent. I cannot excuse her duplicity in giving Miss Henderson\u0027s name instead of her own at Mr. Linthicum\u0027s Drug store, since the result might have been so fearfully fatal; yet I entreat you to believe that there may have been no inimical animus in the act. I attribute her death entirely to an over-dose of the drug, voluntarily taken, but taken in a moment of strong excitement.\" \n \n The feeling of relief from suspense, not only among Joseph\u0027s friends, but throughout the crowded court-room, was clearly manifested: all present seemed to breathe a lighter and fresher atmosphere. \n \n Mr. Blessing wiped his forehead and his fat cheeks, and looked benignly around. \"There are a hundred little additional details,\" he said, \"which will substantiate my evidence; but I have surely said sufficient for the ends of justice. The heavens will not fall because I have been forced to carve the emblems of criminal vanity upon the sepulchre of an unfortunate child,—but the judgment of an earthly tribunal may well be satisfied. However, I am ready,\" he added, turning towards Mr. Spenham; \"apply all the engines of technical procedure, and I shall not wince.\" \n \n The manner of the prosecuting attorney was completely changed. He answered respectfully and courteously, and his brief cross-examination was calculated rather to confirm the evidence for the defence than to invalidate it. \n \n Mr. Pinkerton then rose and stated that he should call no other witnesses. The fact had been established that Mrs. Asten had been in the habit of taking arsenic to improve her complexion; also that she had purchased much more than enough of the drug to cause death, at the store of Mr. Ziba Linthicum, only a few days before her demise, and under circumstances which indicated a desire to conceal the purchase. There were two ways in which the manner of her death might be explained; either she had ignorantly taken an over-dose, or, having mixed the usual quantity before descending to the garden to overhear the conversation between Mr. Asten and Lucy Henderson, had forgotten the fact in the great excitement which followed, and thoughtlessly added as much more of the poison. Her last words to her husband, which could not be introduced as evidence, but might now be repeated, showed that her death was the result of accident, and not of design. She was thus absolved of the guilt of suicide, even as her husband of the charge of murder. \n \n Mr. Spenham, somewhat to the surprise of those who were unacquainted with his true character, also stated that he should call no further witness for the prosecution. The testimonies of Mr. Augustus Fitzwilliam Case and Mr. Benjamin Blessing—although the latter was unnecessarily ostentatious and discursive—were sufficient to convince him that the prosecution could not make out a case. He had no doubt whatever of Mr. Joseph Asten\u0027s innocence. Lest the expressions which he had been compelled to use, in the performance of his duty, might be misunderstood, he wished to say that he had the highest respect for the characters of Mr. Asten and also of Miss Lucy Henderson. He believed the latter to be a refined and virtuous lady, an ornament to the community in which she resided. His language towards her had been professional,—by no means personal. It was in accordance with the usage of the most eminent lights of the bar; the ends of justice required the most searching examination, and the more a character was criminated the more brightly it would shine forth to the world after the test had been successfully endured. He was simply the agent of the law, and all respect of persons was prohibited to him while in the exercise of his functions. \n \n The judge informed the jurymen that he did not find it necessary to give them any instructions. If they were already agreed upon their verdict, even the formality of retiring might be dispensed with. \n \n There was a minute\u0027s whispering back and forth among the men, and the foreman then rose and stated that they were agreed. \n \n The words \"Not Guilty!\" spoken loudly and emphatically, were the signal for a stormy burst of applause from the audience. In vain the court-crier, aided by the constables, endeavored to preserve order. Joseph\u0027s friends gathered around him with their congratulations; while Mr. Blessing, feeling that some recognition of the popular sentiment was required, rose and bowed repeatedly to the crowd. Philip led the way to the open air, and the others followed, but few words were spoken until they found themselves in the large parlor of the hotel. \n \n Mr. Blessing had exchanged some mysterious whispers with the clerk, on arriving; and presently two negro waiters entered the room, bearing wine, ice, and other refreshments. When the glasses had been filled, Mr. Blessing lifted his with an air which imposed silence on the company, and thus spake: \"\u0027Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\u0027 There may be occasions when silence is golden, but to-day we are content with the baser metal. A man in whom we all confide, whom we all love, has been rescued from the labyrinth of circumstances; he comes to us as a new Theseus, saved from the Minotaur of the Law! Although Mr. Held, with the assistance of his fair sister, was the Ariadne who found the clew, it has been my happy lot to assist in unrolling it; and now we all stand together, like our classic models on the free soil of Crete, to chant a p?an of deliverance. While I propose the health and happiness and good-fortune of Joseph Asten, I beg him to believe that my words come ab imo pectore,—from my inmost heart: if any veil of mistrust, engendered by circumstances which I will not now recall, still hangs between him and myself, I entreat him to rend that veil, even as David rent his garments, and believe in my sincerity, if he cannot in my discretion!\" \n \n Philip was the only one, besides Joseph, who understood the last allusion. He caught hold of Mr. Blessing\u0027s hand and exclaimed: \"Spoken like a man!\" \n \n Joseph stepped instantly forward. \"I have again been unjust,\" he said, \"and I thank you for making me feel it. You have done me an infinite service, sacrificing your own feelings, bearing no malice against me for my hasty and unpardonable words, and showing a confidence in my character which—after what has passed between us—puts me to shame. I am both penitent and grateful: henceforth I shall know you and esteem you!\" \n \n Mr. Blessing took the offered hand, held it a moment, and then stammered, while the tears started from his eyes: \"Enough! Bury the past a thousand fathoms deep! I can still say: foi de Belsain!\" \n \n \"One more toast!\" cried Philip. \"Happiness and worldly fortune to the man whom misfortunes have bent but cannot break,—who has been often deceived, but who never purposely deceived in turn,—whose sentiment of honor has been to-day so nobly manifested,—Benjamin Blessing!\" \n \n While the happy company were pouring out but not exhausting their feelings, Lucy Henderson stole forth upon the upper balcony of the hotel. There was a secret trouble in her heart, which grew from minute to minute. She leaned upon the railing, and looked down the dusty street, passing in review the events of the two pregnant days, and striving to guess in what manner they would affect her coming life. She felt that she had done her simple duty: she had spoken no word which she was not ready to repeat; yet in her words there seemed to be the seeds of change. \n \n After a while the hostler brought a light carriage from the stable, and Elwood Withers stepped into the street below her. He was about to take the reins, when he looked up, saw her, and remained standing. She noticed the intensely wistful expression of his face. \n \n \"Are you going, Elwood,—and alone?\" she asked. \n \n \"Yes,\" he said eagerly; and waited. \n \n \"Then I will go with you,—that is, if you will take me.\" She tried to speak lightly and playfully. \n \n In a few minutes they were out of town, passing between the tawny fields and under the russet woods. A sweet west wind fanned them with nutty and spicy odors, and made a crisp, cheerful music among the fallen leaves. \n \n \"What a delicious change!\" said Lucy, \"after that stifling, dreadful room.\" \n \n \"Ay, Lucy—and think how Joseph will feel it! And how near, by the chance of a hair, we came of missing the truth!\" \n \n \"Elwood!\" she exclaimed, \"while I was giving my testimony, and I found your eyes fixed on me, were you thinking of the counsel you gave me, three weeks ago, when we met at the tunnel?\" \n \n \"I was!\" \n \n \"I knew it, and I obeyed. Do you now say that I did right?\" \n \n \"Not for that reason,\" he answered. \"It was your own heart that told you what to do. I did not mean to bend or influence you in any way: I have no right.\" \n \n \"You have the right of a friend,\" she whispered. \n \n \"Yes,\" said he, \"I sometimes take more upon myself than I ought. But it\u0027s hard, in my case, to hit a very fine line.\" \n \n \"O, you are now unjust to yourself, Elwood. You are both strong and generous.\" \n \n \"I am not strong! I am this minute spoiling my good luck. It was a luck from Heaven to me, Lucy, when you offered to ride home with me, and it is, now—if I could only swallow the words that are rising into my mouth!\" \n \n She whispered again: \"Why should you swallow them?\" \n \n \"You are cruel! when you have forbidden me to speak, and I have promised to obey!\" \n \n \"After all you have heard?\" she asked. \n \n \"All the more for what I have heard.\" \n \n She took his hand, and cried, in a trembling voice: \"I have been cruel, in remaining blind to your nature. I resisted what would have been—what will be, if you do not turn away—my one happiness in this life! Do not speak—let me break the prohibition! Elwood, dear, true, noble heart,—Elwood, I love you!\" \n \n \"Lucy!\" \n \n And she lay upon his bosom. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52743.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
