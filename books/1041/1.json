{"id":16267,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. JOSEPH.","content":"Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept. His work-day dress had disappeared; he wore his best Sunday suit, put on with unusual care, and there were faint pomatum odors in the air when he sat down to the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n Her face said—and she knew it—as plain as any words, \"What in the world does this mean?\" Joseph, she saw, endeavored to look as though coming down to supper in that costume were his usual habit; so she poured out the tea in silence. Her silence, however, was eloquent; a hundred interrogation-marks would not have expressed its import; and Dennis, the hired man, who sat on the other side of the table, experienced very much the same apprehension of something forthcoming, as when he had killed her favorite speckled hen by mistake. \\n\\n \\n\\n Before the meal was over, the tension between Joseph and his aunt had so increased by reason of their mutual silence, that it was very awkward and oppressive to both; yet neither knew how to break it easily. There is always a great deal of unnecessary reticence in the intercourse of country people, and in the case of these two it had been specially strengthened by the want of every relationship except that of blood. They were quite ignorant of the fence, the easy thrust and parry of society, where talk becomes an art; silence or the bluntest utterance were their alternatives, and now the one had neutralized the other. Both felt this, and Dennis, in his dull way, felt it too. Although not a party concerned, he was uncomfortable, yet also internally conscious of a desire to laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n The resolution of the crisis, however, came by his aid. When the meal was finished and Joseph betook himself to the window, awkwardly drumming upon the pane, while his aunt gathered the plates and cups together, delaying to remove them as was her wont, Dennis said, with his hand on the door-knob: \"Shall I saddle the horse right off?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess so,\" Joseph answered, after a moment\u0027s hesitation. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rachel paused, with the two silver spoons in her hand. Joseph was still drumming upon the window, but with very irregular taps. The door closed upon Dennis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said she, with singular calmness, \"a body is not bound to dress particularly fine for watching, though I would as soon show him that much respect, if need be, as anybody else. Don\u0027t forget to ask Maria if there\u0027s anything I can do for her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph turned around with a start, a most innocent surprise on his face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, aunt, what are you talking about?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are not going to Warne\u0027s to watch? They have nearer neighbors, to be sure, but when a man dies, everybody is free to offer their services. He was always strong in the faith.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph knew that he was caught, without suspecting her man?uvre. A brighter color ran over his face, up to the roots of his hair. \"Why, no!\" he exclaimed; \"I am going to Warriner\u0027s to spend the evening. There\u0027s to be a little company there,—a neighborly gathering. I believe it\u0027s been talked of this long while, but I was only invited to-day. I saw Bob, in the road-field.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rachel endeavored to conceal from her nephew\u0027s eye the immediate impression of his words. A constrained smile passed over her face, and was instantly followed by a cheerful relief in his. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it rather a strange time of year for evening parties?\" she then asked, with a touch of severity in her voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They meant to have it in cherry-time, Bob said, when Anna\u0027s visitor had come from town.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That, indeed! I see!\" Rachel exclaimed. \"It\u0027s to be a sort of celebration for—what\u0027s-her-name? Blessing, I know,—but the other? Anna Warriner was there last Christmas, and I don\u0027t suppose the high notions are out of her head yet. Well, I hope it\u0027ll be some time before they take root here! Peace and quiet, peace and quiet, that\u0027s been the token of the neighborhood; but town ways are the reverse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All the young people are going,\" Joseph mildly suggested, \"and so—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, I don\u0027t say you shouldn\u0027t go, this time,\" Rachel interrupted him; \"for you ought to be able to judge for yourself what\u0027s fit and proper, and what is not. I should be sorry, to be sure, to see you doing anything and going anywhere that would make your mother uneasy if she were living now. It\u0027s so hard to be conscientious, and to mind a body\u0027s bounden duty, without seeming to interfere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She heaved a deep sigh, and just touched the corner of her apron to her eyes. The mention of his mother always softened Joseph, and in his earnest desire to live so that his life might be such as to give her joy if she could share it, a film of doubt spread itself over the smooth, pure surface of his mind. A vague consciousness of his inability to express himself clearly upon the question without seeming to slight her memory affected his thoughts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, remember, Aunt Rachel,\" he said, at last, \"I was not old enough, then, to go into society. She surely meant that I should have some independence, when the time came. I am doing no more than all the young men of the neighborhood.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, yes, I know,\" she replied, in a melancholy tone; \"but they\u0027ve got used to it by degrees, and mostly in their own homes, and with sisters to caution them; whereas you\u0027re younger according to your years, and innocent of the ways and wiles of men, and—and girls.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph painfully felt that this last assertion was true. Suppressing the impulse to exclaim, \"Why am I younger \u0027according to my years?\u0027 why am I so much more \u0027innocent\u0027—which is, ignorant—than others?\" he blundered out, with a little display of temper, \"Well, how am I ever to learn?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By patience, and taking care of yourself. There\u0027s always safety in waiting. I don\u0027t mean you shouldn\u0027t go this evening, since you\u0027ve promised it, and made yourself smart. But, mark my words, this is only the beginning. The season makes no difference; townspeople never seem to know that there\u0027s such things as hay-harvest and corn to be worked. They come out for merry-makings in the busy time, and want us country folks to give up everything for their pleasure. The tired plough-horses must be geared up for \u0027em, and the cows wait an hour or two longer to be milked while they\u0027re driving around; and the chickens killed half-grown, and the washing and baking put off when it comes in their way. They\u0027re mighty nice and friendly while it lasts; but go back to \u0027em in town, six months afterwards, and see whether they\u0027ll so much as ask you to take a meal\u0027s victuals!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph began to laugh. \"It is not likely,\" he said, \"that I shall ever go to the Blessings for a meal, or that this Miss Julia—as they call her—will ever interfere with our harvesting or milking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The airs they put on!\" Rachel continued. \"She\u0027ll very likely think that she\u0027s doing you a favor by so much as speaking to you. When the Bishops had boarders, two years ago, one of \u0027em said,—Maria told me with her own mouth,—\u0027Why don\u0027t all the farmers follow your example? It would be so refining for them!\u0027 They may be very well in their place, but, for my part, I should like them to stay there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There comes the horse,\" said Joseph. \"I must be on the way. I expect to meet Elwood Withers at the lane-end. But—about waiting, Aunt—you hardly need—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, yes, I\u0027ll wait for you, of course. Ten o\u0027clock is not so very late for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It might be a little after,\" he suggested. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not much, I hope; but if it should be daybreak, wait I will! Your mother couldn\u0027t expect less of me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When Joseph whirled into the saddle, the thought of his aunt, grimly waiting for his return, was already perched like an imp on the crupper, and clung to his sides with claws of steel. She, looking through the window, also felt that it was so; and, much relieved, went back to her household duties. \\n\\n \\n\\n He rode very slowly down the lane, with his eyes fixed on the ground. There was a rich orange flush of sunset on the hills across the valley; masses of burning cumuli hung, self-suspended, above the farthest woods, and such depths of purple-gray opened beyond them as are wont to rouse the slumbering fancies and hopes of a young man\u0027s heart; but the beauty and fascination, and suggestiveness of the hour could not lift his downcast, absorbed glance. At last his horse, stopping suddenly at the gate, gave a whinny of recognition, which was answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Elwood Withers laughed. \"Can you tell me where Joseph Asten lives?\" he cried,—\"an old man, very much bowed and bent.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph also laughed, with a blush, as he met the other\u0027s strong, friendly face. \"There is plenty of time,\" he said, leaning over his horse\u0027s neck and lifting the latch of the gate. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right; but you must now wake up. You\u0027re spruce enough to make a figure to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, no doubt!\" Joseph gravely answered; \"but what kind of a figure?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Some people, I\u0027ve heard say,\" said Elwood, \"may look into their looking-glass every day, and never know how they look. If you appeared to yourself as you appear to me, you wouldn\u0027t ask such a question as that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I could only not think of myself at all, Elwood,—if I could be as unconcerned as you are—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I\u0027m not, Joseph, my boy!\" Elwood interrupted, riding nearer and laying a hand on his friend\u0027s shoulder. \"I tell you, it weakens my very marrow to walk into a room full o\u0027 girls, even though I know every one of \u0027em. They know it, too, and, shy and quiet as they seem, they\u0027re un-merciful. There they sit, all looking so different, somehow,—even a fellow\u0027s own sisters and cousins,—filling up all sides of the room, rustling a little and whispering a little, but you feel that every one of \u0027em has her eyes on you, and would be so glad to see you flustered. There\u0027s no help for it, though; we\u0027ve got to grow case-hardened to that much, or how ever could a man get married?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Elwood!\" Joseph asked, after a moment\u0027s silence, \"were you ever in love?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\"—and Elwood pulled up his horse in surprise,—\"well, you do come out plump. You take the breath out of my body. Have I been in love? Have I committed murder? One\u0027s about as deadly a secret as the other!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two looked each other in the face. Elwood\u0027s eyes answered the question, but Joseph\u0027s,—large, shy, and utterly innocent,—could not read the answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s easy to see you\u0027ve never been,\" said the former, dropping his voice to a grave gentleness. \"If I should say Yes, what then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then, how do you know it,—I mean, how did you first begin to find it out? What is the difference between that and the feeling you have towards any pleasant girl whom you like to be with?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All the difference in the world!\" Elwood exclaimed with energy; then paused, and knitted his brows with a perplexed air; \"but I\u0027ll be shot if I know exactly what else to say; I never thought of it before. How do I know that I am Elwood Withers? It seems just as plain as that,—and yet—well, for one thing, she\u0027s always in your mind, and you think and dream of just nothing but her; and you\u0027d rather have the hem of her dress touch you than kiss anybody else; and you want to be near her, and to have her all to yourself, yet it\u0027s hard work to speak a sensible word to her when you come together,—but, what\u0027s the use? A fellow must feel it himself, as they say of experiencing religion; he must get converted, or he\u0027ll never know. Now, I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve understood a word of what I\u0027ve said!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes!\" Joseph answered; \"indeed, I think so. It\u0027s only an increase of what we all feel towards some persons. I have been hoping, latterly, that it might come to me, but—but—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But your time will come, like every man\u0027s,\" said Elwood; \"and, maybe, sooner than you think. When it does, you won\u0027t need to ask anybody; though I think you\u0027re bound to tell me of it, after pumping my own secret out of me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph looked grave. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never mind; I wasn\u0027t obliged to let you have it. I know you\u0027re close-mouthed and honest-hearted, Joseph; but I\u0027ll never ask your confidence unless you can give it as freely as I give mine to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You shall have it, Elwood, if my time ever comes. And I can\u0027t help wishing for the time, although it may not be right. You know how lonely it is on the farm, and yet it\u0027s not always easy for me to get away into company. Aunt Rachel stands in mother\u0027s place to me, and maybe it\u0027s only natural that she should be over-concerned; any way, seeing what she has done for my sake, I am hindered from opposing her wishes too stubbornly. Now, to-night, my going didn\u0027t seem right to her, and I shall not get it out of my mind that she is waiting up, and perhaps fretting, on my account.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A young fellow of your age mustn\u0027t be so tender,\" Elwood said. \"If you had your own father and mother, they\u0027d allow you more of a range. Look at me, with mine! Why, I never as much as say \u0027by your leave.\u0027 Quite the contrary; so long as the work isn\u0027t slighted, they\u0027re rather glad than not to have me go out; and the house is twice as lively since I bring so much fresh gossip into it. But then, I\u0027ve had a rougher bringing up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish I had had!\" cried Joseph. \"Yet, no, when I think of mother, it is wrong to say just that. What I mean is, I wish I could take things as easily as you,—make my way boldly in the world, without being held back by trifles, or getting so confused with all sorts of doubts. The more anxious I am to do right, the more embarrassed I am to know what is the right thing. I don\u0027t believe you have any such troubles.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, for my part, I do about as other fellows; no worse, I guess, and likely no better. You must consider, also, that I\u0027m a bit rougher made, besides the bringing up, and that makes a deal of difference. I don\u0027t try to make the scales balance to a grain; if there\u0027s a handful under or over, I think it\u0027s near enough. However, you\u0027ll be all right in a while. When you find the right girl and marry her, it\u0027ll put a new face on to you. There\u0027s nothing like a sharp, wide-awake wife, so they say, to set a man straight. Don\u0027t make a mountain of anxiety out of a little molehill of inexperience. I\u0027d take all your doubts and more, I\u0027m sure, if I could get such a two-hundred-acre farm with them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know,\" cried Joseph eagerly, his blue eyes flashing through the gathering dusk, \"I have often thought very nearly the same thing! If I were to love,—if I were to marry—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hush!\" interrupted Elwood; \"I know you don\u0027t mean others to hear you. Here come two down the branch road.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The horsemen, neighboring farmers\u0027 sons, joined them. They rode together up the knoll towards the Warriner mansion, the lights of which glimmered at intervals through the trees. The gate was open, and a dozen vehicles could be seen in the enclosure between the house and barn. Bright, gliding forms were visible on the portico. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just see,\" whispered Elwood to Joseph; \"what a lot of posy-colors! You may be sure they\u0027re every one watching us. No flinching, mind; straight to the charge! We\u0027ll walk up together, and it won\u0027t be half as hard for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52714.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
