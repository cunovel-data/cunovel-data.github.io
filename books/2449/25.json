It is clear that our cloning techniques at UMB permit us to clone a clone indefinitely. Ten thousand years from now we could possess genetic material which is contemporary with this very moment... now! Perhaps this will be of greater service to humankind than the understanding of consciousness.\\n\\n - Morgan Hempstead, Lectures at Moonbase\\n\\n ROUTINE SENSOR FIRINGS sent telltale lights flickering across the computer wall. The passage of the lights produced a weird shift in the shop\u0027s illumination. The curved bulkhead opposite the computer face reflected yellow, then green, now mauve... red.\\n\\n The color shift passed across a chart in Timberlake\u0027s hand as he read it and compared the chart\u0027s predictions with the readings in front of him.\\n\\n The overhead screen showed Prudence on Com-central about midway through her watch and Flattery dozing in his action couch.\\n\\n Strange he wouldn\u0027t take off for quarters, Timberlake thought.\\n\\n Bickel emerged from between the Ox\u0027s two branchings just as a wash of green splashed down on him from the wall.\\n\\n \"That last reading\u0027s off only .008,\" Timberlake said.\\n\\n \"Insignificant,\" Bickel said. \"Waveforms?\"\\n\\n Timberlake nodded at the oscilloscope in front of him, feeling a sharp pain shoot through his neck. He felt tired and stiff. Bickel had driven them, working through three shifts. Timberlake rubbed his neck.\\n\\n Bickel turned from studying the scope. \"Remember I told you to remind me about all the oscillations involved in life? Rhythms, vibrations just one great big series of drumbeats.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Timberlake said. \"You about ready for the full-scale run-through?\"\\n\\n Bickel stared at the flickering lights reluctant to move now that the moment of test had come. He knew the source of his reluctance - the secret thing he had done, and fear of its consequences.\\n\\n One more test... and then... what?\\n\\n Black box - white box.\\n\\n \"You think it\u0027s not going to work?\" Timberlake asked. He felt impatient with Bickel but sensed this couldn\u0027t be pushed.\\n\\n \"The human nervous system - including the region of the brain we assume influences consciousness - has come through one hell of a lot of tests,\" Bickel said.\\n\\n \"And this thing...\" Timberlake nodded toward the Ox, \"is a logically simple analogue of the human brain.\"\\n\\n \"Logical simplicity has damn little bearing on our problem. We\u0027re engineering something, all right, but not by the old bridge-building rules.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s stalling, Timberlake thought. Why? \"Then what\u0027re we doing?\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t take much, just a word sometimes to upset the logical applecart,\" Bickel said. \"The brain\u0027s had to meet a lot of requirements that had nothing whatsoever to do with design simplicity. For one thing, it had to survive while it developed. Its size and shape had a bearing on that. It had to adapt existing structure to new functions.\"\\n\\n Bickel met Timberlake\u0027s eyes. \"The human brain\u0027s an obvious hybrid mating of function and structure. There are strengths in that, but weaknesses, too.\"\\n\\n \"So?\" Timberlake said, and shrugged. \"What\u0027s upsetting the applecart now?\"\\n\\n \"Raj\u0027s talking about psychospace and psychorelationships. That damn causal track of neuron impulses spreading out to form new kinds of space. It\u0027s quite possible for our normal universe to be twisted through an infinite number of psychospaces.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" Timberlake stared at him, wondering at the fear in Bickel\u0027s voice.\\n\\n Bickel went on: \"There can be an infinite number of types of consciousness. Every time I come near turning this thing loose, I start wondering what space it\u0027ll inhabit.\"\\n\\n \"Raj and his damn horror stories,\" Timberlake said.\\n\\n Bickel continued to stare at the Ox structure, wondering if he had done the right thing to act secretly.\\n\\n Was this damn electronic maze going to create its own guilt?\\n\\n To reach a level where it could accept a black-box imprint the Ox-cum-computer had to surmount barriers, Bickel knew. It had to flex its mental muscles. And guilt was a barrier.\\n\\n By blank-space programming, supplying data with obvious holes in it, he had inserted an information series on the subject of death. The on-line operative command was for the computer to fill in the gaps. Now, by parallel insertion of the address data for the life-maintenance program on a cow embryo in the farm-stock hyb tanks, Bickel had provided the computer with a simple way to fill the gaps in its information.\\n\\n It could kill the embryo.\\n\\n I had to act secretly, Bickel told himself. I couldn\u0027t ring in Timberlake - now with his inhibitions. And any of the others might\u0027ve told Tim.\\n\\n \"You think we\u0027re missing some fault in the system?\" Timberlake asked. \"What\u0027s bugging you? The fact that the random search stopped of its own accord?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Bickel shook his head. \"That search pattern ran into an irregularity, a threshold it couldn\u0027t cross.\"\\n\\n \"Then what\u0027s holding you back, for Christ\u0027s sake?\"\\n\\n Bickel swallowed. He found it required increasing effort to hold his attention on an unbroken thread of reasoning where it concerned bringing the Ox to consciousness. There was a sensation of swimming against a stiff current.\\n\\n With what kind of a mirror can consciousness look at itself? he wondered. How can the Ox say: \"This is myself?\" What will it see?\\n\\n \"Human nervous systems have the same kinds of irregularities and imperfections,\" Timberlake said. \"Their properties vary statistically.\"\\n\\n Bickel nodded agreement. Timberlake was right. That was the reason they had introduced random error into the Ox - statistical imperfection.\\n\\n \"You worrying about pulse regulation?\" Timberlake asked.\\n\\n Bickel shook his head. \"No.\" He put his palm against a plastic-encased neuron block protruding from the Ox. \"We\u0027ve got a homeostat whose main function is dealing with errors - with negative reality. Consciousness is always looking at the back side of whatever confronts us, always staring back at us.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve left the gaps in it so it\u0027ll need us,\" Timberlake said. \"You\u0027re fussed about threshold regulation.\"\\n\\n Bickel looked at Timberlake, thinking: Threshold? Yes, that was part of it. The brain cells and peripheral neurons in a human tied together so that their differences averaged out. You got the effect of smooth gradation. The effect. Illusion.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re missing something,\" Bickel muttered.\\n\\n Timberlake wondered at the fear in Bickel\u0027s voice, the way the man\u0027s head turned from side to side like a caged animal.\\n\\n \"If this thing takes off on its own, we have no control over it,\" Bickel said. \"Raj is right.\"\\n\\n \"Raj\u0027s Golem stories!\" Timberlake sneered.\\n\\n \"No,\" Bickel was fearfully serious. \"This thing has new kinds of memories. They have only the vaguest relationship to human memories. But memories Tim - the nerve gets stacked in psychospaces - they\u0027re the patterns that create behavior. What\u0027s this thing going to do when we turn it on... if we don\u0027t give it experiences of the kind the human race has survived?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know what the racial traumas are and that\u0027s where you\u0027re hung up.\"\\n\\n The voice was Flattery\u0027s, and they looked up to the overhead screen to see him sitting still half-cocooned in his action couch and rubbing sleep from his eyes. Beyond him, Prudence maintained her vigil at the big board as though that were the only thing concerning her.\\n\\n Bickel suppressed a feeling of irritation with Flattery. \"You\u0027re the psychiatrist. Isn\u0027t knowledge of trauma supposed to be one of your tools?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re asking about racial trauma,\" Flattery said. \"We can only guess at racial trauma.\"\\n\\n Flattery stared out of the screen at Bickel, thinking:\\n\\n John\u0027s panicky. Why? Because the Ox suddenly started acting on its own?\\n\\n \"We have to bring this thing into being,\" Bickel said, looking at the Ox. \"But we can\u0027t be sure what it is. This is the ultimate stranger. It can\u0027t be like one of us. And if it\u0027s different... yet alive and aware of its aliveness...\"\\n\\n \"So you start casting around in your mind for ways to make it more like us,\" Flattery said.\\n\\n Bickel nodded.\\n\\n \"And you think we\u0027re the products of our racial and personal trauma?\" Flattery asked. \"You don\u0027t think consciousness is the apparent effect of a receptor?\"\\n\\n \"Dammit, Raj!\" Bickel snapped. \"We\u0027re within a short leap of solving this thing! Can\u0027t you feel that?\"\\n\\n \"But you wonder,\" Flattery said, \"are we making a creature that\u0027ll be invulnerable... at least invulnerable to us?\"\\n\\n Bickel swallowed.\\n\\n \"You think,\" Flattery went steadily on, \"this beast we\u0027re creating has no sexual function; it can\u0027t possibly be like us. It has no flesh; it can\u0027t possibly know what flesh fears and loves. So now you\u0027re asking: How do we simulate flesh and sex and the racial sufferings through which humans have blundered? The answer\u0027s obvious: We can\u0027t do this. We don\u0027t know all our own instincts. We can\u0027t sort the shadows and reflections out of our history.\"\\n\\n \"We can sort out some of them,\" Bickel insisted. \"We have an instinct to... win... to survive for...\" He wet his lips with his tongue, looked around at the computer wall.\\n\\n \"Perhaps that\u0027s only hubris,\" Flattery said. \"Maybe this is just monkey curiosity and we won\u0027t be satisfied until we\u0027ve been creators the way God\u0027s a creator. But then it may be too late to turn back.\"\\n\\n As though he hadn\u0027t heard, Bickel said. \"And there\u0027s the killer instinct. That one goes right down into the slime where it was kill or be killed. You can see the other side of it all the time in our instinct to play it safe... to \u0027be practical\u0027.\"\\n\\n He has done something secret, Flattery thought. What has Bickel done? He has done something he\u0027s afraid of.\\n\\n \"And guilt feelings are grafted right onto that killer instinct,\" Bickel said. \"That\u0027s the buffer... the way we keep human behavior within limits. If we implant...\"\\n\\n \"Guilt involves sin,\" Flattery said. \"Where do you find in either religion or psychiatry a need for sin?\"\\n\\n \"Instinct\u0027s just a word,\" Bickel said. \"And we\u0027re a long way from the word\u0027s source. What is it? We can raise fifty generations of chickens from embryo to chick in test tubes. They never see a shell. But the fifty-first generation, raised normally under a hen, still knows to peck its way out.\"\\n\\n \"Genetic imprint,\" Flattery said.\\n\\n \"Imprint.\" Bickel nodded. \"Something stamped on us. Stamped hard. Oh, we know. We know these instincts without ever bringing them to consciousness. They\u0027re what lower our awareness, make us angry, violent, passionate...\" Again, he nodded.\\n\\n What has he done? Flattery asked himself. He\u0027s panicky because of it. I have to find out!\\n\\n \"The Cain-and-Abel syndrome,\" Bickel said. \"Murder and guilt. It\u0027s back there someplace... stamped inside us. The cells remember.\"\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t the vaguest idea what you\u0027re saying,\" Flattery accused. \"You\u0027re separating positive and negative pairs, confusing moral judgments with reasoning, reversing the normal course of -\"\\n\\n \"Reversing!\" Bickel pounded. \"That\u0027s what I was trying to think of - reversing. The ability to turn pleasure into pain or pain into pleasure... that\u0027s a part of consciousness we haven\u0027t -\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s sickness,\" Flattery said.\\n\\n \"The power to be sane is also the power to go mad,\" Bickel said. \"Your own words!\"\\n\\n Flattery stared out of the screen at him, caught up short by this turn of the argument... and a sudden suspicion about what Bickel could have done.\\n\\n \"You know,\" Timberlake said, speaking in a low, reasonable tone, \"if an instinct is something to which the whole system must refer in a moment of stress, that\u0027s something like a computer\u0027s trapping function mated to a supervisory program.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re beyond the point of engineering and have been for some time,\" Flattery said.\\n\\n \"Right back where we started from,\" Bickel agreed. \"We can duplicate synapses with unijunction transistors; juggle conduction rate and absolute refractory periods by choice of pseudoneuron fibers, fit our neural networks with multiplying and inhibitory endbulbs at will... but, in the end, we always come up against that inescapable question...\"\\n\\n \"How do you control what must remain beyond control? I\u0027ve already told you. Love.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t control it,\" Bickel declared. \"You merely aim it... and the aiming device has to be instincts. As you say, Raj, it must love us, be loyal to us. But does that mean it will worship us? Are we to be its gods? And if it\u0027s to be loyal, does that mean it has to have a conscience? Can there be loyalty without a conscience? And can it have a conscience without experiencing guilt?\"\\n\\n \"Guilt\u0027s a prison!\" Flattery protested. \"You can\u0027t imprison a free -\"\\n\\n \"Who says it has to be free?\" Bickel demanded. \"You\u0027re arguing against yourself! That\u0027s the whole damned idea: How do we control it? When you come right down to it: Am I free? Are you?\"\\n\\n Flattery glared at him.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re instinct-ridden, conscience-ridden bits of protoplasm,\" Bickel said:\\n\\n \"What instincts?\" Flattery asked.\\n\\n \"You sound like a damn broken record!\" Bickel snapped. \"What instincts? You can\u0027t trace the instincts! Well, for one thing, we\u0027ve an instinct to kill - to kill and eat. We don\u0027t really give one particle of a damn where we get our energy - not down there in the psychic basement we don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"If it were only that simple,\" Flattery said.\\n\\n \"When you get below stairs it is,\" Bickel said. \"I don\u0027t need a doctorate in psychiatry to tell me what I\u0027d do if the veneer were stripped off.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d revert to the savage, eh? To the animal!\"\\n\\n \"To find out what\u0027s engineered into the system, you\u0027re damn right I would ! What the hell have you head doctors been studying all these years with your dreams and your complexes and your Christ? You\u0027ve trapped yourselves into an endless formal dance with fixed postures and... Christ! You remind me of a pack of fops doing the minuet!\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve employed reverence and caution to approach God in Man,\" Flattery said. \"You don\u0027t gouge into the human psyche with an egg beater and stir up all the -\"\\n\\n \"The hell you don\u0027t!\"\\n\\n They glared at each other, Bickel desperate with indecision, and Flattery\u0027s suspicions verging on certainty.\\n\\n He has given the Ox the means to kill, Flattery thought. His argument and his anger betray it. But kill what? Not one of us, certainly. A colonist in the hyb tanks? No. One of the stock animals! He\u0027d dip his toe into violence first, see if the Ox could really do it.\\n\\n But he cannot have already made the black box - white box transfer.\\n\\n Prudence, dividing her attention between the control console and the clash of wills, felt herself shift further and further into a state of heightened awareness. She sensed Com-central\u0027s minute temperature variations, heard the constant metallic creakings of deck and bulkheads around her, saw Flattery\u0027s growing suspicions and Bickel\u0027s desperate defensiveness, knew her own heartbeats and tiny variations in her body chemistry.\\n\\n It was the chemistry that fascinated her: the thought that all through this subtle play of organic and inorganic matter which she called \"myself,\" messages of which she was only dimly aware (if at all) were being transmitted and acted upon.\\n\\n The computer with its enormous library of data culled from millions of minds had offered her a way to explore the issue Bickel had raised, and she could not resist this.\\n\\n Where and how are the instincts carried?\\n\\n While the argument between Flattery and Bickel raged, she had translated the question onto an edge-coded tape, shifted it into the computer section of her board, tripped the action switch.\\n\\n This went beyond chemical-base sequence, she knew, and into the area where knowledge of protein structure itself was only theoretical code. But if the computer gave her an answer that could be translated into a physical function, she knew she could explore the answer through experiments on her own body.\\n\\n \"Bickel, what\u0027ve you done?\" Flattery demanded.\\n\\n Prudence looked up from her console, saw Flattery, his shoulders tensed as though about to leap, staring into the screen. The screen revealed Bickel and Timberlake, their backs turned, staring at the computer wall and the blocks-and-angles contortion that was the Ox.\\n\\n The hum of the computer could be felt throughout the shop and Com-central. The play of sensor and telltale lights across the big board and the shop\u0027s panels had reached a glittering tempo. Drain gauges showed energy consumption almost at the limits the system could tolerate. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/destination-void-destination-void-1/page-25.html","bookId":2449,"book":{"id":2449,"title":"Destination: Void (Destination: Void #1)","description":"Storyline: Destination: Void (Destination: Void #1) \\n The starship Earthling, filled with thousands of hybernating colonists en route to a new world at Tau Ceti, is stranded beyond the solar system when the ship\u0027s three Organic Mental Cores, disembodied human brains that control the vessel\u0027s functions, go insane.
