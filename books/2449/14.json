Working together, the components produce more than... - Prudence Lon Weygand (#3), Incomplete segment from message capsule IT REQUIRED ALMOST twenty minutes for Prudence to regain her composure. By that time, Timberlake had run a check-list survey on every hyb-tank complex. He did it with a compulsive determination that none of them misunderstood. His function as life-systems engineer had been ignited. Flattery let the thing run its course and a bit longer. Bickel was fretting to get back to his work, but Timberlake needed this role reinforcement. And Prudence needed recovery time. Bickel finally had enough waiting. \"Can we get back to work?\" he demanded. \"I can take the board now, Tim,\" Flattery said. Timberlake studied his instruments. \"Okay. On the count.\" They shifted the board, and Timberlake sat up, a sharp ache across his back telling him how tense he had been. \"Let\u0027s get back to the shop,\" Bickel said. \"How far along are you?\" Prudence asked. \"Barely beginning,\" Bickel said. \"Let\u0027s get cracking.\" \"Is a man just a machine\u0027s way of making another machine?\" she asked. \"Just like Sam Butler\u0027s hen,\" Timberlake said. \"Philosophy 1.\" \"Philosophy some other time, huh?\" Bickel suggested. \"Just a minute,\" she said. \"By attempting to reproduce an artificial consciousness, we\u0027re monkeying with variation of variability. Now, there\u0027s a field that all good little divines\" - she nodded toward Flattery - \"and most scientists have agreed by a compact of silence is the exclusive territory of God in Heaven and God\u0027s handiwork on earth - the genes.\" \"Yeah,\" Bickel said. \"That\u0027s great. Let\u0027s solve it some other time.\" \"You still don\u0027t get it, none of you,\" she said. Bickel glared at her. \"Don\u0027t I? Okay, Prue. Let\u0027s strip off the fancy verbiage. We\u0027re damned if we solve this problem and dead if we don\u0027t. Is that what you were trying to say?\" \"Bravo!\" she said, and turned to look at Flattery. Flattery scowled at his board, pointedly ignoring her. \"You see, Raj?\" she asked. She can\u0027t possibly know my instructions, Flattery thought. She might guess, but she can\u0027t know. And certainly she couldn\u0027t stop me if I had to blow us all to Kingdom Come. \"Yes, I see,\" Flattery said. \"Don\u0027t underestimate John Lon Bickel.\" At the sound of his name, Bickel\u0027s head came up. He stared at Flattery\u0027s profile, seeing the way the man\u0027s sensitive fingers moved like spider legs across the big board. \"You\u0027re so very clever, Raj,\" she said. \"And so damn stupid!\" \"That\u0027s enough of that!\" Bickel snapped, turning to glare at Prudence. \"We\u0027d better clear a little air, here. We\u0027re on our own, Prue. You\u0027ve no idea how much on our own we are. We have to depend on each other because we sure as hell can\u0027t depend on the Tin Egg! We can\u0027t afford to snap and bite at each other.\" Oh, can\u0027t we now, she thought. \"We\u0027re trapped on a ship that contains only one top-drawer mechanism,\" Bickel said. \"We\u0027ve only one thing that functions smoothly and beautifully the way it should - our computer. Everything else works as though it\u0027d been designed and built by six left-handed apes.\" \"Bickel thinks this was all deliberate,\" Timberlake said. Prudence caught herself in an involuntary glance at Flattery, forced her attention away from Bickel and onto Timberlake. This is far too early for Bickel to suspect, she thought. Timberlake avoided her eyes. He looked like a small boy who\u0027d been caught stealing jam. Flattery broke the silence. \"Deliberate?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" Timberlake said. \"He thinks the other six ships had the same kind of failure - something rotten with the OMCs.\" Bickel\u0027s far more alert and suspicious than anyone suspected, Prudence thought. Raj or I will have to side with him; there\u0027s no other way to keep control of the situation. \"Why... the OMCs?\" Flattery asked. \"Let\u0027s not tiptoe around it,\" Bickel said. \"The thing\u0027s obvious. What feature of these ships is never mentioned in the stress analyses? What feature do we assume is proof against failure?\" \"Surely not the OMCs,\" Flattery said. He tried to hold his voice to a bantering level, failed, and thought: God help us. Bickel\u0027s seen through the sham far too soon. \"Certainly the OMCs,\" Bickel said. \"And they gave us three of the damn things! One in service and two for backup. Never a hint that an OMC could fail, yet we had three on the Tin Egg!\" \"Why?\" Prudence asked. \"To make damn sure we got beyond the point of no return before we got the cold-turkey treatment,\" Bickel said. I guess I\u0027m elected, Prudence thought. She said: \"More of Project\u0027s goddamn maneuvering! Sure. It\u0027d be right in character.\" Flattery shot a startled look at her, returned his attention to the big board before Bickel noticed. \"Cold turkey;\" Bickel said. \"This ship\u0027s one elaborate simulation device with a single purpose - and my guess is the others were the same.\" \"Why?\" Flattery demanded. \"Why would they do such a thing?\" \"Can\u0027t you see it?\" Bickel asked. \"Don\u0027t you recognize the purpose? It casts its shadow over everything around us. It\u0027s the only thing that makes any sense out of this charade. The secrecy, the mystery, the maneuvering - everything\u0027s calculated to put us on a greased slide into a very special ocean. It\u0027s not just cold turkey, it\u0027s sink or swim. And the only way we can swim is to develop an artificial consciousness.\" \"Then why such an elaborate sham?\" Flattery asked. \"Why all the colonists, for example?\" \"Why not the colonists?\" Bickel countered. \"Ready replacements for any members of the crew slaughtered on the way. Another arrow in the quiver just in case we do get over the hump to a habitable planet where we can plant the seed of humankind. And... maybe there\u0027s another reason.\" \"What?\" Prudence demanded. \"I can\u0027t say just yet,\" Bickel said. \"It\u0027s just a hunch... and there\u0027s something a hell of a lot more important we have to consider - the destructive potential of this project.\" \"You\u0027d better explain that,\" Flattery said, but he could feel in the dryness of his throat and mouth that Bickel already had seen through to the horror element of Project Consciousness. \"Let\u0027s not kid ourselves,\" Bickel said. \"If we really solve this, the whatever-you-call-it we develop could be a kind of ultimate threat to humankind...ogue, Frankenstein\u0027s monster, cold intelligence without warm emotions, an angry horror.\" He shrugged. \"Once there was an island in Puget Sound; you all know about it. What happened? Did they solve it?\" \"So we install inhibitions, fail-safe features,\" Prudence said. \"How?\" Bickel asked. \"Can we develop this consciousness without giving it free will? Maybe that was the original problem with our Creator - giving us consciousness without permitting us to turn against... what? God?\" Consciousness, the gift of the serpent, Flattery thought. He wet his lips with his tongue. \"So?\" \"So this ship has an ultimate fail-safe device to protect Earth and the rest of humanity,\" Bickel said. \"The only sure one I can think of, given all the variables, is a human being - one of us.\" He looked at each of them. \"One of us set to pull the pin and blow us all to hell if we go sour.\" \"Oh, come now!\" Flattery said. \"It could be you,\" Bickel said. \"Probably is... but maybe you\u0027re too obvious.\" Prudence put a hand to her breast, thought: Holy Jesus! I never once considered that. But Bickel\u0027s right... and it\u0027s Raj, of course. He\u0027s the only one that fits. What do I do now? Timberlake stirred out of a deep silence. He had heard the argument and the only thing that surprised him was how easy it was to accept Bickel\u0027s summation. Why was Bickel right? He was right, of course. But why did they accept it when the thing really wasn\u0027t that obvious? Was it awe of Bickel - clearly the strongest mind among them? Or was it that they already knew the facts - unconsciously? \"I tell you something,\" Timberlake said. \"Bickel\u0027s right and we know it. So one of us is set to pull the pin. I don\u0027t want to know who.\" \"No argument,\" Bickel said. \"Whoever it is... if this thing goes sour, I\u0027d be the last person in the... Tin Egg to stop him.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/destination-void-destination-void-1/page-14.html","bookId":2449,"book":{"id":2449,"title":"Destination: Void (Destination: Void #1)","description":"Storyline: Destination: Void (Destination: Void #1) The starship Earthling, filled with thousands of hybernating colonists en route to a new world at Tau Ceti, is stranded beyond the solar system when the ship\u0027s three Organic Mental Cores, disembodied human brains that control the vessel\u0027s functions, go insane.
