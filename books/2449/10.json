Accepting this, you become an affirmer of The Void, which is to be understood as the Primordial Nothingness: that is, the raw stuff out of which all is created as well as the background against which every creation can be discerned.\n - The Education of a Chaplain/Psychiatrist (Moonbase Documents)\n IT HAD BEEN a tiring watch and Flattery longed to return to his quarters. He wanted to bathe himself in the field generator there, to examine the mood of the computer complex. That was one of his prime duties: to be certain that the computer had settled back into pure mechanism after being deprived of its last Organic Mental Core. There was always the off chance that one of these attempts might achieve success by accident.\n But there was no way he could leave early without arousing the wrong kinds of suspicions. Well, there was another duty for the psychiatrist-chaplain to perform. He looked at Bickel.\n \"You can\u0027t monitor every nuance of your machine\u0027s behavior,\" Flattery said. \"You can\u0027t be certain of every way its circuits may interact.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Bickel said. \"Adding all the parts doesn\u0027t give you the sum you want - or need. So why wouldn\u0027t those numbskulls at UMB build their circuits around Eng multipliers? Answer me that.\"\n Timberlake glanced at Flattery, thought: Go ahead! Get Bickel started on that subject. He\u0027s Johnny One-Note on that one!\n \"There was some mention back at UMB,\" Flattery said, \"that you were trying to get them to use -\"\n \"Trying?\" Bickel snarled. \"I practically got down on my knees and begged. They acted like I was a moron, kept saying computers only add - even when they\u0027re multiplying it\u0027s only series addition. They kept this up until I -\"\n \"You offered no logical circuit changes,\" Flattery said. \"That\u0027s the way I heard it.\"\n \"Because I didn\u0027t get the chance,\" Bickel said. \"Look! The Eng multiplier is solid-state and small enough to fit into any of our miniaturization requirements. It works something like a cathode follower; so the circuit requirements aren\u0027t too weird for us to follow. It\u0027s essentially a multiplier. Depending on the circuitry, it\u0027ll take several potentials of linear, semilinear or even nonlinear circuits and it\u0027ll yield a potential which is the product of the inputs. It multiplies them. But what\u0027s more important, when you reverse the circuitry, you get a device that taps a circuit - divides it, mind you - at a point which varies with the load. It works like a nerve cell!\"\n \"The UM B team must\u0027ve had good reason not to take you up on this,\" Prudence said. \"If they -\n \"They said I hadn\u0027t proved this was an analogue of organic function,\" Bickel sneered. \"Hadn\u0027t proved it! Kee-rist! They wouldn\u0027t even spare me computer time to work out test circuitry. Everything was tied up trying to define consciousness.\"\n \"You buy their definition, don\u0027t you?\" Flattery asked. \"If I did, I wouldn\u0027t\u0027ve asked them to define it again,\" Bickel snorted. \"I\u0027ve had about all the label juggling I can stomach. Consciousness is pure awareness, they said. Then what about the objects of consciousness? I ask. Disregard them, they say. It\u0027s pure awareness. What\u0027s awareness without an object to focus on? I ask. Not important, they say. It\u0027s pure awareness. Then they turn right around and say this pure awareness is a pattern of three primary forces. What are these three primary forces? An \u0027I\u0027 entity plus the organism of this entity plus everything external which could act as a stimulus. Plus objects! But that\u0027s not it, they say. This merely means pure awareness juggles three factors and it\u0027s a senseless complication to try to multiply them two and two when you could add them and follow the circuits in a much more direct fashion.\"\n \"You\u0027re oversimplifying the argument,\" Prudence said.\n \"All right, I\u0027m oversimplifying! But those are the essentials.\"\n \"And you had a ready answer, of course,\" she said.\n \"I\u0027ve already told you I couldn\u0027t beg, borrow, or steal any computer time.\"\n \"But you insist you can prove your -\"\n \"Look,\" Bickel said, \"they told me I couldn\u0027t prove an organic analogue. But I know I can.\"\n \"You just know it,\" she said. \"You can\u0027t find words to quite -\"\n \"When you\u0027ve worked with as many thoughtput instrumentation and computer designs as I have,\" he said, \"you get a feeling for function. There are times when you can just look at the design of a circuit and you know immediately how it\u0027s supposed to function. You don\u0027t need the manufacturer\u0027s specifications.\"\n \"Do I understand you correctly?\" Flattery asked. \"You\u0027re referring to God as a manufacturer? If that\u0027s -\"\n \"Go ahead!\" Bickel snapped. \"Look at the design of the human cerebellum. Don\u0027t try to pick a fight with me over who designed it. Just look at it. You\u0027re a doctor. What\u0027s it suggest to you?\"\n \"What does it suggest to you?\" Flattery countered.\n \"That some potential effect is mediated there,\" Bickel said. \"This is a balancing system... very like the vestibular reflex that keeps us from falling on our asses when we walk.\"\n \"But the cerebellum also is a terminus,\" Prudence said.\n \"Cerebral output to the cerebellum doesn\u0027t even stop when you\u0027re asleep,\" Flattery said. \"How can you -\"\n \"So the cerebellum soaks up energy like an infinite sponge,\" Bickel said. \"Energy is always pouring into it - emotional, sensory, motor, and mental energy. Why do we blandly assume the cerebellum engages in no activity? You can\u0027t find that anywhere else in nature or in devices made by man - where a system as complicated as this just sits there and does nothing.\"\n \"You\u0027re arguing that the cerebellum is the seat of consciousness?\" Flattery asked.\n \"And you haven\u0027t defined consciousness,\" Prudence said. She kept her attention fixed on Bickel, hiding her excitement. His argument wasn\u0027t new, but she sensed he had a clearer understanding of where he was going with it then ever before.\n \"Seat of consciousness? No! I\u0027m arguing that the cerebellum could mediate consciousness, integrate it, balance it... and that consciousness is a field phenomenon growing out of three or more lines of energy. We are more than our ideas.\"\n \"Prue\u0027s right,\" Flattery said. \"You\u0027re not defining it.\" He glanced at Prudence, aware of her excitement and resenting it. Knowing the source of his resentment gave little solace.\n \"But I can come at it through the back door,\" Bickel said.\n \"What it\u0027s not,\" Prudence said.\n \"Right!\" Bickel said. \"It\u0027s not introspection, not sensing, feeling, or thinking. These are all physiological functions. Machines can do all these things and still not be conscious. What we\u0027re hunting is a third-order phenomenon...elationship, not a thing. It\u0027s not synonymous with awareness. It\u0027s neither subjective nor objective. It\u0027s a relationship.\"\n \"We\u0027re more than our ideas,\" Prudence said.\n \"There\u0027s the answer to the UMB\u0027s glorified adding machines,\" Bickel said. \"It\u0027s what I kept telling them... about this undefined human consciousness. When you add the inputs as a series in time you don\u0027t always get an answer corresponding to the outputs. And since it isn\u0027t addition, it has to be a more sophisticated mathematical problem.\"\n Timberlake, listening to Bickel, could feel the fitness intuitively. Bickel was going in the right direction, even though the landscape around them was fuzzy. We\u0027re more than our ideas.\n Prudence leaned back, weighing Bickel\u0027s words. He had to be given free rein, that was the directive. But he also had to feel he was being obstructed. Sensing that she had let herself get too close to the problem, she forced anger into her voice: \"Damn it to hell, you still haven\u0027t defined it!\"\n \"We may never define it,\" Bickel said. \"But that doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t reproduce it.\"\n \"You want to start mocking up a prototype to test your theories?\" Flattery asked.\n \"Using our communications AAT system as a basis,\" Bickel said.\n \"The AAT is linked directly to the computer core,\" Flattery said. \"It\u0027s part of the translation master program. If you make a mistake, you destroy the heart of the computer. I\u0027m not sure we should -\"\n \"It\u0027ll be securely fused,\" Bickel said. \"No chance of a backlash getting through to -\"\n \"Without the computer, our automatics cease functioning,\" Timberlake said. \"Maybe we\u0027d better reconsider. If -\"\n \"Come off of that, Tim!\" Bickel protested. \"You could set up this safety system as well as I could. There\u0027s not a chance of anything getting through to the -\"\n \"I keep thinking of the UMB\u0027s so-called thinking machines,\" Timberlake said. \"We can\u0027t see all their behavior. If we miss one linkage we could upset a vital master program.\"\n \"We\u0027re just not going to miss any linkages. The schematics are all available. This isn\u0027t flying blind. The AAT is the only thing we could really foul up, and at this distance from Moonbase it\u0027s of dubious value.\"\n Does he want to cut us off from the UMB? Flattery wondered. They suggested he might try it. We can\u0027t let him do that.\n \"If you demolished the AAT system,\" Flattery said, \"how long would it take to restore communications?\"\n \"Fifteen to twenty hours,\" Bickel said. \"We could have a jury rig doing the job by then.\"\n Flattery looked questioningly at Timberlake.\n \"That\u0027s about right,\" Timberlake agreed.\n \"We use the AAT as a basis for our simulator,\" Bickel said. \"We\u0027ll raid colony stores for reels of neuron fiber, Eng multipliers, and the other basic components. What we have to get is a system that simulates human nerve-net function.\"\n \"But will it be conscious?\" Flattery asked.\n \"All we can do is cut and try,\" Bickel said. \"Our computer and even the AAT work on analogue additive principles. We\u0027re going to build a system that\u0027s strictly infinite-multiplying. Our system will produce message units that are products of many multipliers.\"\n \"You make it sound so simple,\" Prudence said. \"Connect net A to net B at points D and D prime and you get the Consciousness Factor - CF for short.\"\n Bickel\u0027s lips thinned. \"You have a better plan?\"\n Did I push too hard? she wondered. And she spoke quickly, \"Oh, I\u0027m with you, Bickel. You obviously know all the answers.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know all the answers,\" Bickel growled, \"but I\u0027m not going to sit out here moaning about fate... and I\u0027m not turning back.\"\n What if we have to turn back? Flattery wondered. What do we do about Bickel\u0027s inhibition then?\n \"Are you going to wait for Moonbase to answer?\" Flattery asked.\n Bickel glanced at Prudence. \"I\u0027d prefer starting at once, but that means I\u0027d miss my shift on the board... and since I\u0027ll need Tim -\"\n \"We can handle it,\" Flattery said. \"Everything seems to be running smoothly.\"\n Prudence looked up at the big board and the inactive repeaters over her couch, wondering at her sudden feeling of chill. I\u0027m afraid to take that board, she thought.\n Those thousands of lives down in the hyb tanks... all depending on right-the-first-time reactions. Did the UMB big-domes really know what they were doing when they sent us out here? Was this the only way? Should we dehyb more people to help us? But that would overload several systems... including the Bickel system. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/destination-void-destination-void-1/page-10.html","bookId":2449,"book":{"id":2449,"title":"Destination: Void (Destination: Void #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Destination: Void (Destination: Void #1) \n The starship Earthling, filled with thousands of hybernating colonists en route to a new world at Tau Ceti, is stranded beyond the solar system when the ship\u0027s three Organic Mental Cores, disembodied human brains that control the vessel\u0027s functions, go insane.
