We see reflections of this root-activity in that coordinated cell structure which we commonly refer to as a human being. Have you ever watched a man tapping his finger nervously on a desktop? Have you ever timed the periodicity of the human eyeblink? Breathing has characteristic rhythms for different conditions of the total cell structure. You must keep this in mind when you design devices to be used and occupied by this human bundle of cells. You must always remember the pulse and the needs of the component cells.\\n\\n - Vincent Frame, Biochemist/Designer\\n\\n I\u0027ll use the shot-effect generator again, Bickel thought.\\n\\n He leaned into the organized clutter of the Ox, clipped a lead onto the temporary input, threaded the lead out, and draped it to one side.\\n\\n The effect and the way to achieve it were still clear in his mind. He had awakened suddenly, not knowing how long he had slept, but feeling refreshed and with this answer filling his mind.\\n\\n He turned to the computer leads, linked the Ox through a buffer that would feed its impulses into a test-memory bank, connected this to the new bank of neuron blocks, and put the system on full interlock.\\n\\n \"Will you at least explain what you\u0027re doing, John?\" Flattery\u0027s voice flowed out of the screen.\\n\\n Bickel glanced back, saw Prudence at the controls, Flattery sitting on the edge of an action couch - no sign of Timberlake. But this screen\u0027s eyes didn\u0027t expose all of Com-central. It was probable that Timberlake was trying the hatch. Well, let him.\\n\\n \"We have only ourselves to use as models for producing this Consciousness Function,\" Bickel said. \"And everybody keeps saying we can\u0027t get into ourselves the way an engineer should to duplicate the mechanism. But, friend, there\u0027s another approach - thoroughly tested and effective.\"\\n\\n Prudence said: \"Raj?\"\\n\\n Flattery looked at her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting current drift on the auxiliary power supply.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the shop,\" Flattery stated flatly. \"John\u0027s taken a direct line to prevent us from shutting him off.\" He looked back at Bickel. \"Right?\"\\n\\n \"Right. It shouldn\u0027t cause you any trouble. I\u0027ve isolated the line. Your main board is still functioning.\" Bickel turned back to the Ox, began tying in a series of timed neurofibers.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the tested, effective method?\" Flattery looked up at the telltales on the Com-central board, following Timberlake\u0027s progress by the heat sensors. Timberlake was out in the second zone now, turning in toward the opposite side of the shielding and the hyb tanks.\\n\\n Why was Tim so reluctant to go? Flattery wondered.\\n\\n Bickel finished a triple connection along the timed fibers, straightened. \"The system you can\u0027t tear apart and examine is called a black box. If we can make a white box sufficiently similar and general in potential to the black box - that is, make it sufficiently complex - then we can force the black box, by its own operation, to transfer its pattern of action to the white box. We cross-link them and subject each to identical shot-effect bursts.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your white box?\" Flattery asked, his interest and attention caught in spite of his fears. \"That thing?\" He nodded toward the crazy-block construction of the Ox.\\n\\n \"Hell, no, this is nowhere near complex enough. But out entire computer system is.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s gone crazy! Flattery thought. He can\u0027t be suggesting seriously that he\u0027d throw a scrambling shot-effect burst into the computer!\\n\\n Again, Flattery glanced up at the telltales. Timberlake was at the edge of the hyb tanks, moving at a maddeningly slow pace.\\n\\n \"Then... how does the Ox function in this?\" Flattery asked, returning his attention to the screen.\\n\\n \"This is our sorter,\" Bickel said. \"It sorts the rhythms of the system and acts as a crude set of frontal lobes.\" He linked two parts of his construction by cross-jacks in a patchboard. \"There. Now to run a few tests.\"\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t you wait?\" Flattery demanded. \"Shouldn\u0027t we discuss this a bit more? What if you\u0027ve made a mistake and -\"\\n\\n \"No mistake,\" Bickel said.\\n\\n Flattery looked to the telltales. Timberlake was in the hyb tanks now, but he wasn\u0027t moving just stopped there.\\n\\n We set Bickel, our \"organ of analysis,\" at too high a pitch, Flattery thought. We should\u0027ve known it could run wild.\\n\\n What was keeping Timberlake?\\n\\n \"Straight line test, first,\" Bickel said, and closed a key on the computer wall. He stared at the diagnostic-circuit dials above him.\\n\\n Flattery held his breath, turned slowly to look at the big board in front of Prudence. If Bickel\u0027s test loused up the central computer system, it\u0027d show up first on the big board.\\n\\n The flashboard retained its quiet green. The steady ticking of relays through the graph counters and monitors held at an even pace. Everything appeared soothingly ordinary.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting individual nerve-net responses on the separate blocks,\" Bickel said.\\n\\n Flattery kept his attention on the flashboard. If Bickel ruined the computer, the ship was dead. Most of the Tin Egg\u0027s automatic systems depended on the computer\u0027s inner lines of communication and supervisory control programs.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t you hear me?\" Bickel demanded. \"I\u0027m getting nerve-net response! This thing\u0027ll behave like a human nervous system!\"\\n\\n \"Raj, he is!\"\\n\\n It was Prudence. Flattery dropped his gaze to where she was pointing. She had shifted a small corner of her own auxiliary board into a repeater system tied to Bickel\u0027s diagnostic circuits.\\n\\n \"Beta rhythm,\" she said, pointing to the scope in the center of the board.\\n\\n Flattery watched the sine play of the green line on the scope, digesting what Bickel had said, what that scope implied.\\n\\n Black box - white box.\\n\\n Perhaps it was possible, theoretically, to use the entire computer as a white box to take the transfer pattern called consciousness. But there remained many unanswered questions - and one was more vital than all the others.\\n\\n \"What do you intend using as a black box?\" Flattery asked. \"Where\u0027ll you get your original pattern?\"\\n\\n \"From a conscious human brain. I\u0027m going to take one of our spare hyb tanks and adapt the electroencephalographic feedback system as a man-amplifier.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s utterly mad, Flattery thought. The shot-effect shock would kill the human subject.\\n\\n Bickel looked out of the screen, stared at Flattery - realizing that the psychiatrist-chaplain had seen the possible deadliness of this proposal.\\n\\n Who will bell the cat? Bickel thought. He swallowed. Well, if necessary, I will.\\n\\n \"How would you protect the subject from the shot-effect bursts?\" Prudence asked. \"Curare?\"\\n\\n Even as she asked, she wondered how she was protecting herself from her own experiments. The answer was daunting: No better than Bickel would! What had made this crew so prone to all-or-nothing efforts?\\n\\n \"I believe the subject will have to be fully conscious,\" Bickel said. \"Without any medication... or narcoinhibitions.\"\\n\\n He waited for the explosion from Timberlake. This idea was sure to outrage the conditioning of the life-systems engineer. Where was Timberlake?\\n\\n \"Absolutely not!\" Flattery exploded. \"It\u0027d be murder!\"\\n\\n \"Or maybe... suicide,\" Bickel said.\\n\\n Prudence looked away from the console, met Bickel\u0027s eyes. \"Be reasonable, John,\" she pleaded. \"You\u0027re already endangering the computer with that...\"\\n\\n \"The ship\u0027s still functioning, isn\u0027t it?\" Bickel countered.\\n\\n \"But if you throw a shot-effect burst through that -\" she nodded toward the stacked blocks and interwoven leads of the Ox beside Bickel \"- how\u0027ll you avoid damage to the computer\u0027s core memory?\"\\n\\n \"Core memory\u0027s a fixed system and buffered. I\u0027ll keep the Ox potential below the buffer threshold. Besides...\" he shrugged, \"we\u0027ve already put shot-effect bursts through the computer without -\"\\n\\n \"And scattered information from hell to breakfast!\" she snapped.\\n\\n \"We can still find that information if we use the Ox to sort the addresses for us,\" Bickel said.\\n\\n Flattery glanced at the sensors in front of Prudence. What was wrong with Timberlake? Was he injured? Unconscious? But the sensors revealed a narrow path of movement from the life-systems engineer... all of it within the hyb tank complex.\\n\\n \"If I understand you correctly,\" Prudence said, \"you\u0027ll have to add nerve-net simulation channels to the Ox until it and the computer are as complex as a human nervous system. As you build it and test it, we become more and more dependent on that jury-rigged Ox monstrosity for our very lives.\"\\n\\n \"It has to have a full range of sensory apparatus,\" Bickel said. \"There\u0027s no other way.\"\\n\\n \"There must be!\" she said. \"Where\u0027d you get such a mad idea?\"\\n\\n \"From you.\"\\n\\n Shock momentarily stilled her tongue. \"That\u0027s impossible!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a female,\" Bickel pointed out, \"capable of biological reproduction of conscious life. In that method, you have a substrate of molecules that are capable of assuming a large number of forms... different forms. Those molecules assume a particular form in the presence of a molecule that already has that form.\" He shrugged. \"Black box - white box.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you meant from me personally,\" she said, looking up at the telltale sensors and seeing the apparently irrational movements of Timberlake.\\n\\n \"Look,\" Bickel said, unaware of their preoccupation, \"the basic behavior of the computer will remain intact. We won\u0027t interfere with supervisory programs or command constants. We want to set up a system dealing with probabilities, with mobility constant for the -\"\\n\\n \"Games theory!\" Flattery sneered. \"You can\u0027t predict all the behavior of your machine.\" He looked back at the telltales.\\n\\n What was Tim doing?\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just it!\" Bickel said. \"If the machine\u0027s going to be conscious, we can\u0027t predict all of its behavior... by the very nature of consciousness, by definition. Consciousness is a game where the permissible moves aren\u0027t arbitrarily established in advance. The sole object\u0027s to win.\"\\n\\n Anything goes? Flattery wondered. He focused suddenly on Bickel, recognizing the essentially blasphemous nature of such a concept. There had to be rules!\\n\\n \"The machine gets part of its personality from its creator, part from its opponents,\" Bickel said.\\n\\n Something from God, something from the Devil, Flattery thought. There had to be essential error in this path... somewhere. Bickel was behaving far outside the predictions. Their \"organ of analysis\" was acting illogically. He was not making the best possible move each time.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll introduce error factors and loss increment into the entire computer,\" Prudence cautioned. \"That\u0027s not only illogical, it\u0027s -\" She broke off, studied her board, made a pressure-balance correction in the atmospheric recirculation system, and waited to see if the automatics could hold the new setting.\\n\\n \"You have to make the best possible move at all times,\" Flattery said. \"Your suggestion does not appear to -\"\\n\\n \"There you\u0027ve hit it,\" Bickel agreed. \"Best possible move. Sometimes your best possible move is to make a dangerously poor move that changes the entire theoretical structure of the game. You change the game.\"\\n\\n \"What about all those lives down in the hyb tanks?\" Prudence, asked. \"Do they have any choice in this... game?\"\\n\\n \"They already made their choice.\"\\n\\n \"And while they\u0027re helpless, you change the rules,\" Flattery said.\\n\\n \"That was one of the chances they accepted when they accepted hybernation,\" Bickel said. \"That was their choice.\"\\n\\n Flattery abandoned the argument, pushed himself off his action couch.\\n\\n \"What\u0027re you going to do?\" Prudence asked.\\n\\n \"Check on Tim.\"\\n\\n \"Where is Tim?\" Bickel asked.\\n\\n \"Down in the hyb tanks,\" Flattery said, knowing Bickel could get the answer himself - once he consulted the shop\u0027s repeaters.\\n\\n \"Deep in the hyb tanks?\" Bickel asked.\\n\\n \"Of course!\"\\n\\n \"Prue!\" Bickel snapped. \"Try to raise him on the command circuit.\"\\n\\n She heard the urgency in Bickel\u0027s voice, whirled to obey.\\n\\n There was no response from Timberlake.\\n\\n \"You fools!\" Bickel said.\\n\\n Flattery stopped at the tube hatch, glared up at the screen.\\n\\n \"Who let him go down into the deep tanks?\" Bickel demanded. \"You blind idiots! Don\u0027t you know what he\u0027s likely to find down there?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"This whole damn ship\u0027s nothing but a simulation device,\" Bickel said. \"There\u0027ll be nothing down there except a few crew replacements. Those tanks have to be empty!\"\\n\\n He\u0027s wrong! Flattery thought. Or is he?\\n\\n The thought staggered Flattery. He saw immediately how that might pull the props out from under Timberlake...an tuned as fine as the rest of them for a specific function.\\n\\n \"He\u0027d still have the crew systems,\" Prudence said. She stared across the room at Flattery, feeling the loneliness. The Tin Egg with its programmed peril might contain only a few isolated humans launched into nowhere.\\n\\n They wouldn\u0027t, Flattery thought. But if they\u0027d prepare me to cheat the rest of the crew... His feet felt rooted to the deck. He swallowed in a dry throat. But it\u0027s impossible! They promised me when I discovered the actual Tau Ceti records - if we succeeded we could just send back the message capsule and continue as...\\n\\n \"Raj, are you sick?\" Prudence asked. She studied him, seeing the lost, sunken look in his eyes.\\n\\n \"The Tau Ceti planets are uninhabitable, yes,\" Hempstead had admitted when confronted with the evidence. \"No Eden. But the universe is known to contain billions of inhabitable planets. You realize you can\u0027t come back here, of course. The danger to your hosts.\"\\n\\n \"The biopsy donors were all criminals,\" Flattery had said, springing his other suspicion.\\n\\n \"Brilliant people, but misdirected,\" Hempstead had protested. \"That is one of the reasons you can\u0027t come back, but nothing\u0027s to stop you from going on to explore and find your own Eden.\"\\n\\n Remembering the words, Flattery felt how hollow they sounded.\\n\\n Sham and trickery all the way, he thought. But why? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/destination-void-destination-void-1/page-20.html","bookId":2449,"book":{"id":2449,"title":"Destination: Void (Destination: Void #1)","description":"Storyline: Destination: Void (Destination: Void #1) \\n The starship Earthling, filled with thousands of hybernating colonists en route to a new world at Tau Ceti, is stranded beyond the solar system when the ship\u0027s three Organic Mental Cores, disembodied human brains that control the vessel\u0027s functions, go insane.
