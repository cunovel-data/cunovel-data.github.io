The individual is both laser and target. - Fragment from Message Capsule #4 thought to have originated with Flattery (#4B) model IN COM-CENTRAL, the sounds were those the umbilicus crew had come to accept as normal - the creak of action couches in their gimbals, the click of an occasional relay as it called attention to a telltale on the big board. \"Has Bickel unburdened himself at all about the artificial consciousness project back at UMB?\" Prudence asked. She removed her attention momentarily from the master console, glanced at Flattery, her sole companion on the lonely watch. Flattery appeared a bit pale, his mouth drawn downward in a frown. She returned her attention to the console, noting on the time log that her shipwatch had a little more than an hour yet to run. The strain was beginning to drag at her energy reserves. Flattery was taking a hell of a long time to answer, she thought... but he was famous for the ponderous reply. \"He\u0027s said a little,\" Flattery said, and he glanced at the hatch to the computer maintenance shop where Bickel and Timberlake were working. \"Prue, shouldn\u0027t we be listening in on them, making sure they -\" \"Not yet,\" she said. \"They wouldn\u0027t have to know we were listening.\" \"You underestimate Bickel,\" she said. \"That\u0027s about the worst mistake you can make. He\u0027s fully capable of throwing a trace meter onto the communications - as I have just on the off chance something interesting\u0027ll turn up... like finding us listening.\" \"D\u0027you think he\u0027s started... building?\" \"Mostly preparation at this stage,\" she said. \"They\u0027re collecting material. You can pretty well follow their movements by watching the power drain here on the board, the shifts in temperature sensors and the dosimeter repeaters and the drain on the robox cargo handlers.\" \"They\u0027ve been out into the cargo sections?\" \"One of them has... probably Tim.\" \"You know what Bickel said about the UMB attempt?\" Flattery asked. He paused to scratch an itch under his chin. \"Said the biggest failure was in attention - the experts wandering away, doing everything but keeping their attention on the main line.\" \"That\u0027s a little too warm for comfort,\" she said. \"He may suspect,\" Flattery said, \"but he can\u0027t be certain.\" \"There you go underestimating him again.\" \"Well, at least he\u0027s going to need our help,\" Flattery said, \"and we\u0027ll be able to tell what\u0027s going on from how he needs us.\" \"Are you sure he needs us?\" \"He\u0027ll have to use you for his deeper math analysis,\" Flattery said. \"And me... well, he\u0027s going to be plowing through the von Neumann problem before he gets much beyond the first steps. He may not\u0027ve faced that yet, but he\u0027ll have to when he realizes he has to get deterministic results from unreliable hardware.\" She turned to stare at him, noting the faraway look in his eyes. \"How\u0027s that again?\" \"He has to build with nonliving matter.\" \"So what?\" She returned her attention to the board. \"Nature makes do with the same stuff. Living systems aren\u0027t living below the molecular level.\" \"And you underestimate... life,\" Flattery said. \"The basic elements Bickel has to use are from our robot stores - reels of quasibiological neurons and solid-state devices, nerex wire and things like that - all of it nonliving at a stage far above the molecular.\" \"But their fine structure\u0027s as relevant to their function as any living matter\u0027s is.\" \"Perhaps you\u0027re beginning to see the essential hubris in even approaching this problem,\" Flattery said. \"Oh, come off that, Chaplain. We\u0027re not back in the eighteenth century making Vaucanson\u0027s wonderful duck.\" \"We\u0027re tackling something much more complex than primitive automata, but our intention\u0027s the same as Vaucanson\u0027s.\" \"That\u0027s absolutely not true,\" Prudence said. \"If we succeeded and took our machine back to Vaucanson\u0027s time and showed it to him, he\u0027d just marvel at our mechanical ability.\" \"You miss the mark. Poor Vaucanson would run for the nearest priest and volunteer for the lynch mob to do away with us. You see, he never intended to make anything that was really alive.\" \"It\u0027s only a matter of degree, not basic difference,\" she protested. \"He was like Aladdin rubbing the lamp compared to us,\" Flattery said. \"And even if his intentions were the same as ours, he wasn\u0027t aware of it.\" \"You\u0027re talking in circles.\" \"Am I, really? This is the thing that writers and philosophers have skirted for centuries with their eyes half averted. This is the monster out of folklore, Prue. This is Frankenstein\u0027s poor monster and the sorcerer\u0027s apprentice. The very idea of building a conscious robot can be faced only if we recognize the implicit danger - that we may be building a Golem that\u0027ll destroy us.\" \"In your off hours you tell ghost stories.\" \"Laughter\u0027s as good a way as any of facing this fear,\" he said. \"You\u0027re really serious!\" she accused. \"Never more serious. Why d\u0027you suppose Project\u0027s so happy to send us far out into space to do our work?\" She tried to swallow in a dry throat, realized she was afraid. Flattery had touched a nerve. He had produced a powerful truth from somewhere. She forced herself to face this as a fact when she felt an urge to call the computer shop and beg Bickel and Tim to stop whatever they were doing. The urge sent a chill along her spine. \"Where do we draw the line between what\u0027s living and what\u0027s inanimate?\" Flattery asked. He studied her, seeing the fatigue shadows under her eyes, the trembling of a nerve at her temple. \"Will our... creature be alive?\" She cleared her throat. \"Wouldn\u0027t it be more to the point to ask if our creature will be able to reproduce itself? If there\u0027s any danger... any real danger to -\" \"Then, indeed, we may be on forbidden ground.\" And he wondered why this thought always brought such an empty feeling in the pit of his stomach. \"Oh, for God\u0027s sake, Raj!\" Prudence was vehement. \"Have you completely forgotten that you\u0027re a scientist?\" \"For God\u0027s sake, I can never forget it,\" he said quietly. \"Stop that!\" She realized her voice unconsciously had assumed the peremptory tone of her dormitory mother back in the UMB creche. Dormitory mother! A gray-haired image whose touch was never more than the padded flexor of a robot which she directed from some remote sanctuary in Project Central. Such a sad woman she\u0027d been, so cynical and... remote. \"Religion makes demands that can\u0027t be denied unless you\u0027re willing to pay a terrible price,\" Flattery said. \"Religion\u0027s just a fact like any other,\" Prue countered. \"We investigate primitive religions. Why can\u0027t we investigate our own? Didn\u0027t God make us curious? Aren\u0027t we as scientists supposed to put ourselves beyond the reach of prejudice?\" \"Only a fool imagines he\u0027s beyond the reach of his prejudices.\" \"Well, I prefer to be a Calvinist, I\u0027m willing to be damned for the greater glory of God.\" \"You mustn\u0027t say such things,\" he snapped. He put a hand to his head, thinking: I mustn\u0027t let her goad me this way. \"You can\u0027t show me anything I mustn\u0027t say,\" she said. \"You claim scientists can equate God with ideas of mathematical infinity. We manipulate mathematical infinity; why can\u0027t we manipulate God?\" \"What silly pretensions;\" he said. \"Mathematical infinity. Zero over zero, eh? Or infinity minus infinity? Or infinity times zero?\" \"God times zero,\" she said. \"Why not?\" \"You\u0027re the mathematician!\" he said, his voice pouncing. \"You know better\u0027n anyone that these are indeterminate forms, mathematical nonsense.\" \"God minus infinity. Mathematical nonsense.\" He glared at her. His throat felt dry and burning. She\u0027d tricked him into this corner. It was blasphemy! And he was more vulnerable than she was... guiltier. \"You\u0027re supposed to be doing this to me, aren\u0027t you,\" he accused. \"You\u0027re supposed to push me and test me, give me no peace. I know.\" How little he knows... or even suspects, she thought. \"Infinity doesn\u0027t follow the conditions of number or quantity. If there\u0027s a God, I don\u0027t see why He should follow those conditions, either. As for testing you: horseradish! All you need\u0027s an occasional kick in the philosophy.\" \"Stick to my preaching and let you play with the math, is that it?\" \"There\u0027s no blasphemy in developing a new kind of calculus or any other new tool to deal with our universe,\" she said. \"Our universe?\" Flattery asked. \"As much of it as we can take,\" she said. \"That\u0027s the whole idea of a colony ship, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Is it?\" he asked. She adjusted the course-constant repeater, said, \"I\u0027ll stick to math. How about a calculus that goes beyond the limits of X over Y as they tend toward infinity? That should be possible.\" \"Creating a new kind of calculus and building this living, sentient creature aren\u0027t the same,\" he said. \"Without the calculus we may never achieve the creature.\" She keeps trying to corner me, he thought. Why? \"The issue\u0027s whether we\u0027re intruding on God\u0027s domain of creation.\" \"You Holy Joes are all alike. You want to glorify God but you\u0027d limit the means.\" Flattery stared at the curved gray metal of the bulkhead above him, seeing the tiny imperfections in the crackle pattern of its finish. He felt he was being maneuvered. She was stalking him the way a man might stalk game. Was it his soul she was after? He sensed he was in profound danger, that the idea of consciousness as something they could create might inflict itself on his soul as an incurable wound. He put a hand to his mouth. I cannot permit her to bait me and tempt me. \"Raj,\" she whispered and there was terror in her voice. He whirled toward her, seeing the streaks of light across the big board like red knife slashes. \"We\u0027re almost at red-line temperature in Sector C-8 of the hyb tanks,\" she said. \"Everything I do seems to make the system oscillate.\" Flattery\u0027s hands flashed out to the life-systems repeater switches, brought his own monitors alive. He scanned the instruments, commanded, \"Call Tim.\" \"Nothing I do seems to work!\" she panted. He glanced at her, saw she was fighting the board, not working with it. \"Call Tim!\" he said. She hit the command circuit switch with the heel of her left hand, shouted, \"Tim to Com-central! Emergency!\" Again, Flattery scanned his instruments. There appeared to be three points of temperature shift outside the hyb tanks with corresponding variation inside. As Prue tried to compensate for one fluctuation, the others fell farther toward the red. He had to force himself to keep his hands off the controls. If tank temperature went into the red without dehyb precautions, there\u0027d be deaths among the helpless occupants. Despite Prue\u0027s desperate efforts, death was approaching three sectors of the C-8 tank-some four hundred human lives in there. The hatch from the computer shop banged open. Timberlake leaped through with Bickel right behind. \"Hyb tanks,\" Prudence gasped. \"Temperature.\" Timberlake threw himself across Com-central into his action couch. His vacsuit rasped against the cocoon lips as he turned, grasped the traveler controls. \"Give me the red switch,\" he snapped. \"To hell with the count! I\u0027m taking it.\" And he took it, the big board swinging across much too fast. \"C-8,\" she said, sinking back and wiping perspiration from her forehead. \"I\u0027ve got it,\" he said. He scanned the dials and gauges, his fingers playing over the console. Bickel slipped into his own couch, tripped his repeaters. \"It\u0027s in the hull shielding,\" he said. \"First two layers,\" Timberlake said. Prudence put a hand to her throat, tried not to look at Bickel. He mustn\u0027t suspect our attention\u0027s on him, she thought. Then: Wouldn\u0027t it be monstrous irony to lose our colonists and burden ourselves with guilt before the need for it? \"That\u0027s doing it,\" Bickel said. She looked across the board above Timberlake, saw the warning telltales winking out, the dials swinging back into normal range. \"Faulty feedback for a patch of our shell reflectors focused on C-8,\" Timberlake said. \"The system started to oscillate and that threw the overload switches, left us wide open.\" \"Another design failure,\" Bickel sneered. And such a simple problem, Bickel thought. The hull curve acted like a lens to focus energy within the ship... unless reflector and shell shielding systems compensated. Prudence traced the line of the remaining telltales. \"C-8\u0027s on a line with that robot stores section you raided. Is that all it takes to throw the ship off balance?\" \"Gives you a wonderful feeling of confidence in the Tin Egg\u0027s design, doesn\u0027t it,\" Bickel said. They didn\u0027t warn me! she thought. They cheated. Calculated emergencies, they said, just enough to keep a fine edge on your reaction abilities. Reaction abilities! \"You overcompensated, Prue,\" Timberlake said. \"Make minimal adjustments to avoid oscillation while you hunt for the source of your trouble. You had sensor telltales flaring right out through the ship to pinpoint where you needed shielding reinforcement.\" I panicked, she thought. \"I guess I let myself get too tired.\" Even as she spoke she sensed how lame the excuse sounded. \u0027 I was too intent doing the job on Flattery, she thought. I had him headed for a nice corner where he\u0027d have to fight his way out... and I missed the ship trouble until it was almost ready to wreck us. It occurred to her then to wonder if one of the crew had her as a \"special project\" to keep her abilities toned up... on edge. \"Prue, you\u0027ve got to remember that when the overload switches go, the computer automatics are out of the circuit,\" Bickel said. \"This thing was designed to be brought back into line by a conscious intelligence - one of us or an OMC.\" \"Oh, shut up!\" she flared. \"I made a mistake. I know it. I won\u0027t do it again.\" \"No damage was done,\" Timberlake said. \"I don\u0027t need you to defend me!\" she snapped. And she thought: No damage! Nothing was harmed except one of the crew - me! She pressed her hands together to still their trembling. We\u0027re sitting ducks for any real emergency. We can\u0027t turn back without the risk of a runaway dive into Sol or becoming another of her wandering comets. We can\u0027t go on unless we solve the unsolvable. Take it easy, Prue,\" Flattery soothed. \"We probably put you on the big board too soon after getting you out of hyb.\" Thanks for the excuse! she thought. Flattery glanced around the room, seeing the poised silence of Bickel and Timberlake-both of them scorched by Prue\u0027s anger. Bickel slid out of his couch, secured a set of test leads in the clip at his left shoulder. A multimeter could be seen protruding from his breast pocket. Timberlake was refining the hull temperature adjustments, putting the system back into the computer circuits. Flattery returned his attention to Prudence. She shouldn\u0027t have panicked, he thought. Not the type. She has a woman\u0027s wide perspective and confidence in her intuition. She should be better at the big board than any of us. Is she under greater strain? Does she know something I don\u0027t?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/destination-void-destination-void-1/page-13.html","bookId":2449,"book":{"id":2449,"title":"Destination: Void (Destination: Void #1)","description":"Storyline: Destination: Void (Destination: Void #1) The starship Earthling, filled with thousands of hybernating colonists en route to a new world at Tau Ceti, is stranded beyond the solar system when the ship\u0027s three Organic Mental Cores, disembodied human brains that control the vessel\u0027s functions, go insane.
