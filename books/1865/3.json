{"id":82211,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Over the next few days, Emily reluctantly unpacked the rest of her belongings that had arrived late from a hold up at the shipping company. Tonight, if it killed her, she would clear out the last of the items. Olivia helped her sift through years of memories. Those memories were all Emily had left, and she clung to them like they were her last heartbeats. The final item in the box took the breath from her, tightening her chest and spinning her emotions out of control. Sighing, Emily slumped on her bed, clinging to a photo showcasing the proud smile of her mother at her high-school graduation. The barrier that she had fought so hard to build over the last few months broke, and the tears came tumbling down. The reality of what had happened - the unwavering fact that she would never see her mother again - hit her hard in that moment.\n Sadness clouded Olivia\u0027s eyes as she watched her friend crumble. \"I don\u0027t know what to say, Emily. I wish I could take this pain and hurt away from you.\"\n Unblinking, Emily reached out her hand, taking Olivia\u0027s in her own. She was thankful that she had her there. The two friends shared a few minutes, neither saying a word, knowing nothing more could be said.\n Standing up, Emily cast a withering smile at her and hastily wiped the tears from both their cheeks. She gave Olivia a hug and sauntered to the bathroom. She was exhausted - not only mentally but also physically. Working three doubles in a row, the last few days caught up with her, and she was looking forward to a relaxing evening on the couch with Dillon. Making her way into the shower, she tried to purge her mind of anything that had to do with her mom. It was difficult, but nonetheless, she did it. Once out, she slid into a pair of comfortable pajamas and set herself up on the couch with a glass of much-needed wine.\n After a while, Olivia walked into the living room, wearing a red summer dress with her hair pinned-up off her shoulders and a clutch in her hand.\n She eyed Emily, hopeful. \"Just come out with Tina and me tonight. It will do justice to your mood.\"\n Giving Olivia a smile, Emily thought about her friend\u0027s new love endeavor, Tina Reed, a twenty-four-year-old graduate of Columbia University. Having been burned by too many men in her past, Olivia swore them off for the time being, deciding women might suit her better.\n Sighing, Emily tossed her hand through her hair. \"I really just want to relax the night away.\" She picked up the bottle of red wine and smiled. \"I plan on polishing this off, too.\"\n Olivia placed a kiss on top of her head. \"Okay, but if for some reason you change your mind, just call my cell.\"\n Emily nodded, and Olivia walked out the door.\n Glancing at the clock, Emily noted it was a quarter past ten. Knowing that Dillon should\u0027ve been there already, she wondered if another late night meeting had held him up. Her thoughts didn\u0027t stray too far when her phone rang a half hour later. It was Dillon calling to announce that he was celebrating a new account out at a club in SoHo. He insisted that she meet him down there. Emily tried to argue that she was exhausted and already settled in for the night, but he wouldn\u0027t relent, his dissatisfaction traveling through the phone. Letting out a sigh, Emily succumbed to his demand, dragged herself into her room, and prepared for an evening out despite her emotional and physical state.\n It can\u0027t be her, Gavin thought to himself, adjusting his eyes across the dimly lit club. He rubbed his palm over his face, staring in her direction. It was though. Molly - the waitress that never called him. Molly - the waitress that tugged at every sense, every fiber, and every male instinct in his body. Molly - the waitress that looked more ravishing now than he could\u0027ve ever imagined. Gavin watched as she moved across the club, making her way through the endless bodies pressed against each other.\n His eyes feasted upon her long auburn hair that spilled over her shoulders onto a tight black dress that fell just above her knees. The perfect amount of cleavage and neck burned a hole into his mind, awakening the undeniable primal urge he had to claim her. His eyes devoured her legs - sleek, long, and shapely - that came to a rest in black heels. Raking his hands through his hair, Gavin couldn\u0027t help but feel the quickening in his heart as she approached.\n He went to move toward her, talk to her, breathe in her scent, but a modest cough from Dillon reluctantly broke his gaze from hers.\n \"I see you looking, Blake, but she\u0027s mine,\" Dillon remarked, a crooked smile twisting his lips.\n Gavin\u0027s mouth fell open as if to speak, but nothing came out. His blue eyes swung over to the beautiful woman who had invaded his world a few days ago and then shifted back to Dillon.\n \"Wait, that\u0027s...Emily?\" Gavin asked, palpable confusion taking over his face.\n \"Yeah, man. I told you she was fucking gorgeous.\" Dillon motioned for Emily to hurry up where she seemed to be frozen and rooted in one spot a few feet away.\n Gavin took a long pull from his beer, a lump forming in his throat as he leaned himself against the bar. Unable to look away, he maintained eye contact with the woman that his friend just proclaimed was his.\n Chewing on her lip, Emily tried to keep her panic at bay when she saw Mr. Tall, Dark, and Fuckable Handsome with Dillon. The air seemed to shift thick. Her balance was knocked askew with every step.\n There\u0027s no way they could possibly know each other. This is Manhattan for Christ\u0027s sake, Emily thought to herself.\n Each beat of her heart pounded harder the closer she got. A curious yet boyish smile rounded Gavin\u0027s lips as a kiss of a dimple indented itself on his cheek. His piercing blue eyes were intense, unblinking in her direction. Emily\u0027s gaze flicked down to his chest, the planes of his pectorals visible under his shirt. If it were possible, he looked even more handsome, relaxed in his casual attire of a black, V-neck T-shirt and jeans that hung perfectly on his waist. His eyes seemed to delve into her and smother every bit of oxygen from her lungs. Taking a long cleansing breath with sweat beading on her brow, Emily approached the two men, trying to focus solely on Dillon.\n Dillon pulled her by the waist into his body and placed an exaggerated kiss on her lips.\n After ordering her a drink, Dillon shifted her in front of him, positioning her back against his chest. She had center view of the stranger when Dillon finally spoke. \"Gavin, this is my girlfriend, Emily Cooper. Emily, Gavin Blake.\"\n Unable to pull his eyes from hers, Gavin reached down tentatively, drawing her hand to his lips. Kissing it softly, he hesitated, almost absorbing the heat that radiated from her skin. Reluctantly, he finally let go. \"The pleasure\u0027s most definitely all mine, Emily.\"\n Inwardly marveling at the way Gavin\u0027s slight stubble felt against her knuckles, Emily gave a curt nod and smiled. \"It\u0027s nice to finally meet you.\"\n \"She\u0027s beautiful, isn\u0027t she?\" Dillon asked, looking over to Gavin.\n Averting her gaze to the floor, Emily flushed, embarrassed by the comment. Nonetheless, she grinned, trying to regain her bearings from the shock coursing its way through her body.\n Gavin\u0027s gaze dropped to her mouth, her ruby red lips fascinating every fucking inch of him. He shifted his eyes back to hers, which were a variation of green melting into gold. Beautiful, he thought to himself.\n Drawing his lower lip roughly through his teeth, Gavin let his words hang. \"You\u0027re a very lucky man, Dillon.\"\n Dillon nodded in agreement, tossing back the last of his whiskey on the rocks. \"Come dance with me, babe.\" He caught Emily by her hips and dragged her out to the dance floor.\n Knowing she shouldn\u0027t, Emily risked a glance back to Gavin as they walked away.\n Gavin tried to maintain his cool when she peered over her shoulder to look back at him. He watched the way Dillon held her close and the irrefutable loving way she responded to him. He watched the way she stared into Dillon\u0027s eyes, giving him her undivided attention. Ordering another beer, Gavin fought back the urge to walk onto the dance floor, knock his friend out, and pull her into his arms.\n As if his mind couldn\u0027t register anyone else in the club, Gavin brushed off countless women who approached him. He knew he was in uncharted territory and that his thoughts were irrational, considering Dillon was a close friend, but he felt as if Emily had a sick pull on him. These new unknown surges of emotions had him at odds with his body and mind.\n And Gavin didn\u0027t like it one bit.\n Eventually, Dillon walked up to Gavin when Emily disappeared into the restroom. He leaned against the bar, a reverent smile breaking out across his face. \"Wishing you were me, buddy?\"\n Gavin couldn\u0027t help feeling a stab of jealousy, but this wasn\u0027t something he was about to confess. \"I\u0027m just wondering how you pulled that one off.\"\n It wasn\u0027t a question but a statement on Gavin\u0027s part. Dillon usually hung with crowds of women that were far wilder than Emily seemed to be.\n Dillon threw his head back and laughed as he ordered a shot of tequila. \"You seem to think you\u0027re the only god in this city.\"\n \"I\u0027m no god, Dillon, and you\u0027re certainly not either,\" Gavin remarked, propping his arm on the rolled leather edge of the bar. \"But I do know that you need to take care of a woman like that.\"\n Dillon started flexing his hips back and forth. \"Oh, I\u0027m taking care of it. She has no complaints whatsoever in that department.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t mean it like that,\" Gavin snapped, trying to rid the thought from his mind. He then smoothed his voice out to a calmer tone. \"Be good to her, seriously.\"\n Cocking his head to the side, Dillon furrowed his brows. \"Since when did you become so worried about how I treat a woman Mr. Non-Commitment? You fuck anything that throws itself at you, and they\u0027re lucky if they get a call the next day.\"\n \"We\u0027re not talking about me,\" Gavin said, drawing a bottle of beer to his mouth. \"Like I said, take care of her.\"\n \"Gavin Blake\u0027s trying to teach me how to treat a woman. This is hysterical.\" He swallowed his drink and slammed the glass down on the bar. \"I\u0027m marrying this one. You\u0027ll see. Just to torture you, you\u0027re going to be in the wedding party.\" Dillon shook his head and laughed but recovered quickly as his expression tightened. \"Like I said earlier, she\u0027s mine. You get enough everywhere you go.\"\n Before Gavin could respond, Emily approached them.\n Dillon handed her a beer, and she smiled. \"Thanks. So what are you guys talking about?\"\n Gavin figured he would play a little game, considering he knew Dillon was taunting him. His eyes concentrated on the exact curve of Emily\u0027s jaw before locking his eyes on hers. \"I\u0027m just wondering how my friend here landed such a beautiful woman. He\u0027s obviously out of his league.\"\n Emily could feel the way Gavin stared at her. His eyes seemed to sink into her, making her want to bare every emotion and every secret.\n What a dangerous talent for a man\u0027s eyes to possess, she thought to herself.\n She went to speak, but Dillon\u0027s voice broke through the deafening level of music. \"Fuck you and your comment. Out of my league?\"\n Gavin laughed mischievously as he casually sank into a seat at the bar. \"Yes, very out of your league.\"\n A grin curled Dillon\u0027s lips. \"Whatever makes you sleep better tonight, man, but she\u0027s the one leaving with me.\" Dillon glanced down at an incoming text and then turned to Emily where she stood inwardly mortified at the conversation taking place. \"Trevor\u0027s on his way, babe. I need to use the restroom, but don\u0027t let this clown fool you while I\u0027m gone. He\u0027s a player.\"\n He dropped a chaste kiss on her cheek and walked away.\n Gavin watched Emily carefully, silence stretching between them as she sipped her beer. He felt her eyes on him, giving nervous little looks that tugged at every rational instinct he had left. Each time her gaze met his, he wanted to sink into it and live in it forever. He wondered if she felt the connection that had passed between them when he kissed her hand.\n He took a long pull from his beer, trying to ease the dryness in his mouth. \"So, Molly, are you enjoying New York?\"\n Knowing that one was coming, Emily let out a laugh. \"Yes, I am actually, stalker boy. Thanks for asking.\"\n \"I\u0027m really not a stalker or a player, honestly,\" he said, chuckling at the nickname she gave him.\n \"The stalker part may be questionable,\" she laughed and so did Gavin. \"But, I have to be honest, I\u0027ve heard otherwise about you being a player.\"\n Emily bit her lip, realizing how horribly offensive those last words must\u0027ve sounded. Even so, now knowing who he was, it was the truth. Olivia told her stories of Dillon\u0027s rich friend, Gavin, being a ladies\u0027 man. She also warned Emily that once she met him, it would take everything in her not to rip off her shirt and watch the buttons scatter on the floor, along with every sexual inhibition following behind them.\n Yep, completely fuckable.\n Shifting in his seat, Gavin flashed a smile. \"And who did you hear that from?\"\n \"Olivia Martin.\"\n \"Mmm, you must not know her that well then,\" he replied, motioning for the bartender to bring them another round.\n \"Let\u0027s see. She was my roommate in college, and I live with her now.\" She smiled. \"I consider her a pretty reliable source, but hey, to each his own.\"\n \"Forgive me and my horrible memory. That\u0027s right; that\u0027s right. You\u0027re Emily and not Molly,\" he laughed, tossing a hand through his hair. \"Of course you know Olivia.\"\n She smiled. \"Yes, my real name is Emily. We\u0027ve established that, but how come I have a feeling you might never let me live that one down?\"\n A delicious grin slid across his lips. \"Ah-ha, I may or may not. But that\u0027s for me to know, and you to find out.\" They both laughed, seeming to relax a bit around one another. \"So what else did Olivia say about me?\"\n \"Ah-ha, that\u0027s for me to know, and you to find out.\"\n Amused by her quick-witted response, Gavin hung his head and laughed. His features softened as he stared into her eyes. \"But, in my defense, the whole player thing\u0027s a misconception. I just haven\u0027t found the right woman yet.\"\n \"Well, there seems to be an awful lot of ladies trying to get your attention right now.\" With the sweep of her hand, Emily gestured toward a group of women at the end of the bar that were noticeably glancing in his direction. \"Pretty decent pick if you ask me.\"\n Although he tried, he couldn\u0027t pull his eyes away from her. He stared at Emily, wanting to let her know - again - the only woman he wanted was already with his friend. \"Unfortunately, most of them are only interested in one thing.\"\n Confusion knitted her brows. \"Isn\u0027t that what all guys want anyway?\"\n \"Not quite, but I like the way you think,\" he laughed, studying the way she nervously tucked her hair behind her ear. He liked it more than he should. \"No, seriously though, I don\u0027t want to come off like a conceited ass, but there\u0027s a fine line between me and my money.\"\n His remark struck an odd cord with Emily. She knew he had money - the whole damn city did. However, to assume women were strictly after him for his cash was obviously some sort of insecurity he had.\n \"Oh, so in your eyes, every woman you date\u0027s a gold digger?\" she remarked, drawing the bottle to her mouth as she leaned casually into her seat.\n Gavin tried hard to fixate his eyes on hers instead of her lips. \"No, it\u0027s not that at all. That came out the wrong way; I apologize.\" He placed his empty drink on the bar. \"It\u0027s just hard to tell who\u0027s real and who\u0027s not. I want a woman who wants me with or without my money.\" He flashed a sheepish grin. \"And, for some reason, I seem to attract the all-beauty-and-no-brains type, too.\"\n \"Oh.\" Emily shifted in her seat, embarrassed at her assumption. She tried to deflect her earlier statement. \"Sounds like you\u0027re trolling the wrong places, buddy.\"\n The bartender put their drinks down.\n Gavin laughed, immensely enjoying her honesty. \"Apparently, I do.\" An infectious smile ran across his mouth. \"Where is it you said you hang out these days other than Bella Lucina?\"\n \"Dillon\u0027s apartment, but thanks for trying again,\" she laughed. She tipped her beer to her lips, allowing herself to hold his gaze a little longer this time. \"Maybe you should search for women at the library? That would take care of the no-brains problem you seem to attract.\"\n \"You\u0027re a pretty funny girl, Emily,\" he remarked, shifting his body to face hers. \"I\u0027m really starting to regret Dillon getting his hands on you first.\"\n Emily\u0027s heart skidded across her chest at his declaration. Before she could answer, she felt a warm hand on her shoulder and assumed it was Dillon.\n She turned and found Trevor flashing his winning smile, his thick blonde hair falling onto his forehead. \"I\u0027m here. Let the party begin!\" he hooted, slapping his hand on Gavin\u0027s shoulder. He then gave Emily a hug and inched his way in between them to order a drink. \"It\u0027s going to be a bender tonight!\"\n Emily smiled, happy to see Trevor. She\u0027d grown close to him over the last few months. Besides the fact that he was Olivia\u0027s brother, he was an all-around good man. Even before she moved to New York, he would call to check up on her to make sure she was doing okay.\n Trevor glanced around the club from behind his glasses. \"Where\u0027s Dillon?\" he asked, accepting his drink from the bartender.\n \"Think he fell in,\" Gavin smirked, motioning toward the restrooms.\n \"I know he left the office way before I did, but that sounds like something he would do, especially if he\u0027s drunk enough,\" Trevor laughed. He then turned to Gavin. \"So how\u0027ve you been, man? Feels like I haven\u0027t seen you in forever.\"\n \"Good. Had to do some traveling for work, but I\u0027m hunkered down for the summer.\"\n \"Having your yearly Fourth of July party at your house in the Hamptons, right?\"\n \"Absolutely,\" Gavin answered. \"I\u0027m actually heading out there this week to open up the place.\"\n Trevor turned to Emily who wasn\u0027t paying attention to the conversation. His laughing brown eyes were wide with excitement. \"Yoo-hoo, Emily, you\u0027re going right?\"\n She looked puzzled as she scanned the club, knowing Dillon had been gone for a while. \"Going where?\" her voice trailed off as she looked away from Trevor.\n \"Gavin\u0027s party in the Hamptons on the Fourth of July. Dillon told you about it, right?\"\n She shrugged, bringing her attention back to Trevor. \"He hasn\u0027t mentioned it yet, but it sounds like fun. I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll be there.\"\n Dillon\u0027s voice broke through the conversation. \"Be where?\" he asked, leaning in to kiss Emily\u0027s neck. \"I hope these guys weren\u0027t trying to proposition you while I was gone.\"\n Twisting her body to face his, Emily smiled. \"No worries; they were entertaining me. You took a while. Are you okay?\"\n \"I had to make a quick phone call.\"\n A mischievous smile tugged at Gavin\u0027s lips. \"We thought you fell in, and we were actually about to assemble a search party. But don\u0027t get high on yourself though; we weren\u0027t going to look too hard.\"\n \"Wow, you two are brutal with one another,\" Emily laughed.\n Trevor took a swig of beer. \"You haven\u0027t seen anything yet, Em. They\u0027re just getting warmed up.\"\n Dillon shook his head and eyed Gavin. \"Once a wiseass, always a wiseass, Blake. Never fails.\"\n Gavin hung his head and laughed. He took a long pull from his beer, swung his eyes over to Emily, and then reluctantly looked at Dillon. \"So how\u0027s about it? Are you two coming to the party?\"\n \"I totally forgot about it,\" Dillon replied. \"But, of course, we\u0027ll be there.\"\n Trevor cocked his head to the side. \"What do you mean you forgot? Dude, you\u0027ve been coming for the last couple of years.\"\n Dillon pulled Emily close to him, anchoring her body in front of his. He wrapped his arms around her shoulders. \"I\u0027ve been distracted by my lady here. I can\u0027t seem to think of anything else.\"\n Emily smiled and noticed a beautifully groomed blonde approach Gavin. She snaked her arm around his waist and planted a kiss on the corner of his mouth. \"I thought it was you, Mr. Blake,\" she said, ordering a drink and letting the bartender know to put it on his tab. \"Where have you been hiding lately?\" Her words slurred as she clung tighter to Gavin, trying to keep her balance.\n \"Obviously not far enough,\" Trevor mumbled under his breath. The woman didn\u0027t hear his remark, but didn\u0027t need to. His expression told all.\n Dillon\u0027s eyes narrowed on the blonde.\n Gavin knew who she was and tried to play it cool. His smile was relaxed as he curled his arm around her waist, trying to hold her steady. \"I\u0027ve been away on business. How\u0027ve you been?\"\n \"Oh, I\u0027ve been doing great. Thanks for asking,\" she replied, shifting her weight closer to Gavin. \"Who do we have here?\" she asked, glancing in Emily\u0027s direction. \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve met before. You\u0027re so cute. Are you one of Gavin\u0027s newest playmates?\"\n Emily\u0027s mouth dropped open, but she said nothing, not wanting to severely insult the woman. She thought the comment was ridiculous, considering Dillon had his arms around her.\n Gavin smirked, gazing in Emily\u0027s direction. \"No, she\u0027s Dillon\u0027s girlfriend. I\u0027m trying my hardest to make a play for a girl named Molly, but unfortunately, she\u0027s already taken.\"\n Emily nervously bit her lip and looked away.\n The pleasant expression left the woman\u0027s face as she shot Dillon a hard look. \"Oh, really? I didn\u0027t know you were seeing anyone, Dillon.\"\n Gavin stood up and effectively caught the blonde by her arm. \"Come on, sweets. We have a lot to catch up on. Take a walk with me.\" He started leading her out of the club, and Emily watched the way the woman stared back at her while she tried to release herself from Gavin\u0027s hold.\n \"Who the heck was that?\" Emily asked, turning to face Dillon.\n \"No one,\" he replied, giving Emily a wide-eyed smile. He dragged a hand through his hair. \"Just some girl he went to college with.\"\n \"One of his ex-girlfriends?\" Emily probed.\n Trevor looked to Dillon but didn\u0027t say a word.\n \"Yeah, just some girl he used to screw around with,\" Dillon replied after ordering a few shots. \"Come on, let\u0027s get hammered, babe.\"\n Gavin made his way through the crowd of sweaty bodies. Walking the woman out of the club, he cornered her against a wall, propping his hand against it. Looking down to her, his expression tightened. \"What are you doing, Monica?\"\n Lifting her chin in defiance, her hazel eyes glassed over. \"What do you mean, Gavin?\" She pushed her hands through her hair. \"He thinks he can just fuck me like that and then go off and start fucking someone else so quickly?\"\n Letting out a sigh, a muscle tensed in his jaw. \"You and Dillon were exactly that and nothing more. Fuck buddies, Monica. Get over it.\"\n Her gaze narrowed on him. \"No, Gavin. If that\u0027s what I was looking for, then I would\u0027ve just fucked you,\" she huskily replied, trailing her finger across his chest. \"Want to take me home tonight? I could add another notch in your bedpost.\"\n \"Not a chance and you know it,\" he quickly noted, grabbing her by the wrist. \"The two of you have been over for a while. Now stop the bullshit.\"\n \"What a joke! We never stopped!\" she snapped. \"I was just fucking around with him upstairs.\"\n Dipping his head, Gavin forced her to stare into his eyes. \"Upstairs, huh?\"\n \"Yeah, maybe I should tell the goody two-shoes he\u0027s here with,\" she replied, trying to push her way past him.\n \"Don\u0027t even think about it, Monica,\" he growled. \"So help me if I find out you get within five feet of her.\"\n Widening her eyes, her voice rose as a curious grin stretched across her mouth. \"What? Do you have a thing for her?\" She paused for a moment and continued when he didn\u0027t answer. \"You do, don\u0027t you? Some friend you are, Gavin Blake,\" she laughed, tossing her hands through her hair again. \"All of you guys - every one of you in your rich little group - are a bunch of fucked-up assholes! I\u0027m just sorry our parents are friends!\"\n Gritting his teeth, Gavin stared down to her for a second. He then signaled for the bouncer. \"Here\u0027s a hundred bucks. Call her a cab and get her out of here now.\"\n \"No problem, Mr. Blake.\" He reached for the money and Monica. She struggled against the beefy man, causing a further spectacle as she called Gavin every name in the book.\n Finally, she was put into a New York City cab and sent on her way.\n Letting out a weighted breath, Gavin turned and headed into the club. He would have to do some damage control in the morning, considering Monica Lemay was indeed the daughter of one of his father\u0027s closest friends. Making his way back to the bar, Gavin wondered how true her statement was. He didn\u0027t put it past Dillon. Dillon was known for it, God knew he was. On the other hand, he didn\u0027t dismiss Monica lying to try and make her way back to Dillon. This wouldn\u0027t be the first time she made a desperate move to get back together with him.\n Dillon spotted Gavin as he approached. Turning to Emily, he let her know he\u0027d be right back. He stalked over to Gavin, tossing his arm around his neck. \"Everything taken care of?\"\n Crossing his arms, Gavin took a step back. \"Yeah, she\u0027s gone. What the fuck are you doing? Are you still messing around with her?\"\n Dillon shrugged nonchalantly. \"I was, but I\u0027m done with her now. She kept calling and harassing me. You know how she gets.\"\n Dillon went to walk away, but Gavin grabbed his arm. \"Man, seriously, you have a pretty cool woman now. What the fuck is wrong with you?\"\n Laughing, Dillon pulled his arm away. \"There you go again concerned about what I\u0027m doing. You just worry about yourself. I told you that I\u0027m done with the whore.\" He tossed his shot down his throat. \"Come on, I don\u0027t want to waste anymore of my night on her.\" He started to walk away and then turned back. \"Oh, I told Emily you used to fuck around with her.\"\n Before Gavin could say a word, Dillon walked back over to Emily, a smile twisting on his lips as he kissed her. Gavin watched as his friend played the smooth Jekyll-and-Hyde he\u0027d come to know over the years. Gavin couldn\u0027t help but notice the way Emily stared at him as he lounged back into his seat.\n \"You really do know how to pick them, Gavin,\" Emily laughed, tilting her beer to her mouth. \"The library - don\u0027t forget the library.\"\n Gavin finished his beer before leveling an icy look at Dillon. His eyes then flicked to Emily as he rubbed at his chin absentmindedly. \"Yeah, I\u0027ve had my share of troubled women I guess,\" he said, motioning for the bartender to bring him another. \"I\u0027ll definitely start with the library as you\u0027ve suggested, Emily.\"\n Over the next few hours, Dillon became mindlessly hammered. The many beers and shots of tequila had caught up with him. By the end of the night, both Trevor and Gavin had to help him out to Trevor\u0027s SUV. Having lost all patience by that point, Gavin tossed him in the backseat and closed the door behind him.\n Trevor shook Gavin\u0027s hand and got into the vehicle.\n Emily stood in the parking lot, feeling embarrassed by Dillon\u0027s drunken stupor. \"I\u0027m sorry about this. He gets a little out of hand when he celebrates a new account.\"\n Gavin leaned against the vehicle, his eyes coming to rest on her lips. \"There\u0027s no need for you to apologize on his behalf,\" he softly remarked, his eyes shifting to meet hers. \"I\u0027ve known him long enough to know how he gets.\"\n Drawing in a deep breath, Emily held her hand out. Trying hard to appear relaxed, her voice sounded unnatural and shaky. \"Well, it was good officially meeting you, Gavin. I guess I\u0027ll see you around.\"\n Closing the space between them, he reached for her hand. He felt momentarily frozen as he stared deeply into her green eyes. He simply shook her hand and gave her a smile. \"It was good to have finally met you, too, Emily. I\u0027ll see you at the Fourth of July party.\"\n Slipping into the front seat, she nodded and smiled in his direction. \"Fourth of July.\"\n Standing in the parking lot, Gavin watched them disappear into the heavy traffic of Manhattan while the shock of the evening from discovering who Emily really was washed over him. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collide-collide-1/page-3.html","bookId":1865,"book":{"id":1865,"title":"Collide (Collide #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Collide (Collide #1) \n A missed first encounter...
