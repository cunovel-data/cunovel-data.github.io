{"id":38544,"no":20,"title":"chapter 20","content":"Captain Gregory of the Missing\u0027 Persons Bureau laid my card down on his wide flat desk and arranged it so that its edges exactly paralleled the edges of the desk. He studied it with his head on one side, grunted, swung around in his swivel chair and looked out of his window at the barred top floor of the Hall of Justice half a block away. He was a burly man with tired eyes and the slow deliberate movements of a night watchman. His voice was toneless, flat and uninterested. \"Private dick, eh?\" he said, not looking at me at all, but looking out of his window. Smoke wisped from the blackened bowl of a briar that hung on his eye tooth. \"What can I do for you?\" \"I\u0027m working for General Guy Sternwood, 3765 Alta Brea Crescent, West Hollywood.\" Captain Gregory blew a little smoke from the corner of his mouth without removing the pipe. \"On what?\" \"Not exactly on what you\u0027re working on, but I\u0027m interested. I thought you could help me.\" \"Help you on what?\" \"General Sternwood\u0027s a rich man,\" I said. \"He\u0027s an old friend of the D.A.\u0027s father. If he wants to hire a full-time boy to run errands for him, that\u0027s no reflection on the police. It\u0027s just a luxury he is able to afford himself.\" \"What makes you think I\u0027m doing anything for him?\" I didn\u0027t answer that. He swung around slowly and heavily in his swivel chair and put his large feet flat on the bare linoleum that covered his floor. His office had the musty smell of years of routine. He stared at me bleakly. \"I don\u0027t want to waste your time, Captain,\" I said and pushed my chair back--about four inches. He didn\u0027t move. He kept on staring at me out of his washed-out tired eyes. \"You know the D.A.?\" \"I\u0027ve met him. I worked for him once. I know Bernie Ohls, his chief investigator, pretty well.\" Captain Gregory reached for a phone and mumbled into it: \"Get me Ohls at the D.A.\u0027s office.\" He sat holding the phone down on its cradle. Moments passed. Smoke drifted from his pipe. His eyes were heavy and motionless like his hand. The bell tinkled and he reached for my card with his left hand. \"Ohls?. . . Al Gregory at headquarters. A guy named Philip Marlowe is in my office. His card says he\u0027s a private investigator. He wants information from me. . . . Yeah? What does he look like? . . . Okey, thanks.\" He dropped the phone and took his pipe out of his mouth and tamped the tobacco with the brass cap of a heavy pencil. He did it carefully and solemnly, as if that was as important as anything he would have to do that day. He leaned back and stared at me some more. \"What you want?\" \"An idea of what progress you\u0027re making, if any.\" He thought that over. \"Regan?\" he asked finally. \"Sure.\" \"Know him?\" \"I never saw him. I hear he\u0027s a good-looking Irishman in his late thirties, that he was once in the liquor racket, that he married General Sternwood\u0027s older daughter and that they didn\u0027t click. I\u0027m told he disappeared about a month back.\" \"Sternwood oughta think himself lucky instead of hiring private talent to beat around in the tall grass.\" \"The General took a big fancy to him. Such things happen. The old man is crippled and lonely. Regan used to sit around with him and keep him company.\" \"What you think you can do that we can\u0027t do?\" \"Nothing at all, in so far as finding Regan goes. But there\u0027s a rather mysterious blackmail angle. I want to make sure Regan isn\u0027t involved. Knowing where he is or isn\u0027t might help.\" \"Brother, I\u0027d like to help you, but I don\u0027t know where he is. He pulled down the curtain and that\u0027s that.\" \"Pretty hard to do against your organization, isn\u0027t it, Captain?\" \"Yeah--but it can be done--for a while.\" He touched a bell button on the side of his desk. A middle-aged woman put her head in at a side door. \"Get me the file on Terence Regan, Abba.\" The door closed. Captain Gregory and I looked at each other in some more heavy silence. The door opened again and the woman put a tabbed green file on his desk. Captain Gregory nodded her out, put a pair of heavy horn-rimmed glasses on his veined nose and turned the papers in the file over slowly. I rolled a cigarette around in my fingers. \"He blew on the 16th of September,\" he said. \"The only thing important about that is it was the chauffeur\u0027s day off and nobody saw Regan take his car out. It was late afternoon, though. We found the car four days later in a garage belonging to a ritzy bungalow court place near the Sunset Towers. A garage man reported it to the stolen car detail, said it didn\u0027t belong there. The place is called the Casa de Oro. There\u0027s an angle to that I\u0027ll tell you about in a minute. We couldn\u0027t find out anything about who put the car in there. We print the car but don\u0027t find any prints that are on file anywhere. The car in that garage don\u0027t jibe with foul play, although there\u0027s a reason to suspect foul play. It jibes with something else I\u0027ll tell you about in a minute.\" I said: \"That jibes with Eddie Mars\u0027 wife being on the missing list.\" He looked annoyed. \"Yeah. We investigate the tenants and find she\u0027s living there. Left about the time Regan did, within two days anyway. A guy who sounds a bit like Regan had been seen with her, but we don\u0027t get a positive identification. It\u0027s goddamned funny in this police racket how an old woman can look out of a window and see a guy running and pick him out of a line-up six months later, but we can show hotel help a clear photo and they just can\u0027t be sure.\" \"That\u0027s one of the qualifications for good hotel help,\" I said. \"Yeah. Eddie Mars and his wife didn\u0027t live together, but they were friendly, Eddie says. Here\u0027s some of the possibilities. First off Regan carried fifteen grand, packed it in his clothes all the time. Real money, they tell me. Not just a top card and a bunch of hay. That\u0027s a lot of jack but this Regan might be the boy to have it around so he could take it out and look at it when somebody was looking at him. Then again maybe he wouldn\u0027t give adamn. His wife says he never made a nickel off of old man Sternwood except room and board and a Packard 120 his wife gave him. Tie that for an ex-legger in the rich gravy.\" \"It beats me,\" I said. \"Well, here we are with a guy who ducks out and has fifteen grand in his pants and folks know it. Well, that\u0027s money. I might duck out myself, if I had fifteen grand, and me with two kids in high school. So the first thought is somebody rolls him for it and rolls him too hard, so they have to take him out in the desert and plant him among the cactuses. But I don\u0027t like that too well. Regan carried a gat and had plenty of experience using it, and not just in a greasy-faced liquor mob. I understand he commanded a whole brigade in the Irish troubles back in 1922 or whenever it was. A guy like that wouldn\u0027t be white meat to a heister. Then, his car being in that garage makes whoever rolled him know he was sweet on Eddie Mars\u0027 wife, which he was, I guess, but it ain\u0027t something every poolroom bum would know.\" \"Got a photo?\" I asked. \"Him, not her. That\u0027s funny too. There\u0027s a lot of funny angles to this case. Here.\" He pushed a shiny print across the desk and I looked at an Irish face that was more sad than merry and more reserved than brash. Not the face of a tough guy and not the face of a man who could be pushed around much by anybody. Straight dark brows with strong bone under them. A forehead wide rather than high, a mat of dark clustering hair, a thin short nose, a wide mouth. A chin that had strong lines but was small for the mouth. A face that looked a little taut, the face of a man who would move fast and play for keeps. I passed the print back. I would know that face, if I saw it. Captain Gregory knocked his pipe out and refilled it and tamped the tobacco down with his thumb. He lit it, blew smoke and began to talk again. \"Well, there could be people who would know he was sweet on Eddie Mars\u0027 frau. Besides Eddie himself. For a wonder he knew it. But he don\u0027t seem to give a damn. We checked him pretty thoroughly around that time. Of course Eddie wouldn\u0027t have knocked him off out of jealousy. The set-up would point to him too obvious.\" \"It depends how smart he is,\" I said. \"He might try the double bluff.\" Captain Gregory shook his head. \"If he\u0027s smart enough to get by in his racket, he\u0027s too smart for that. I get your idea. He pulls the dumb play because he thinks we wouldn\u0027t expect him to pull the dumb play. From a police angle that\u0027s wrong. Because he\u0027d have us in his hair so much it would interfere with his business. You might think a dumb play would be smart. I might think so. The rank and file wouldn\u0027t. They\u0027d make his life miserable. I\u0027ve ruled it out. If I\u0027m wrong, you can prove it on me and I\u0027ll eat my chair cushion. Till then I\u0027m leaving Eddie in the clear. Jealousy is a bad motive for his type. Top-flight racketeers have business brains. They learn to do things that are good policy and let their personal feelings take care of themselves. I\u0027m leaving that out.\" \"What are you leaving in?\" \"The dame and Regan himself. Nobody else. She was a blonde then, but she won\u0027t be now. We don\u0027t find her car, so they probably left in it. They had a long start on us--fourteen days. Except for that car of Regan\u0027s I don\u0027t figure we\u0027d have got the case at all. Of course I\u0027m used to them that way, especially in good-class families. And of course everything I\u0027ve done has had to be under the hat.\" He leaned back and thumped the arms of his chair with the heels of his large heavy hands. \"I don\u0027t see nothing to do but wait,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve got readers out, but it\u0027s too soon to look for results. Regan had fifteen grand we know of. The girl had some, maybe a lot in rocks. But they\u0027ll run out of dough some day. Regan will cash a check, drop a marker, write a letter. They\u0027re in a strange town and they\u0027ve got new names, but they\u0027ve got the same old appetites. They got to get back in the fiscal system.\" \"What did the girl do before she married Eddie Mars?\"\"Torcher.\" \"Can\u0027t you get any old professional photos?\" \"No. Eddie must of had some, but he won\u0027t loosen up. He wants her let alone. I can\u0027t make him. He\u0027s got friends in town, or he wouldn\u0027t be what he is.\" He grunted. \"Any of this do you any good?\" I said: \"You\u0027ll never find either of them. The Pacific Ocean is too close.\" \"What I said about my chair cushion still goes. We\u0027ll find him. It may take time. It could take a year or two.\" \"General Sternwood may not live that long,\" I said. \"We\u0027ve done all we could, brother. If he wants to put out a reward and spend some money, we might get results. The city don\u0027t give me the kind of money it takes.\" His large eyes peered at me and his scratchy eyebrows moved. \"You serious about thinking Eddie put them both down?\" I laughed. \"No. I was just kidding. I think what you think, Captain. That Regan ran away with a woman who meant more to him than a rich wife he didn\u0027t get along with. Besides, she isn\u0027t rich yet.\" \"You met her, I suppose?\" \"Yes. She\u0027d make a jazzy week-end, but she\u0027d be wearing for a steady diet.\" He grunted and I thanked him for his time and information and left. A gray Plymouth sedan tailed me away from the City Hall. I gave it a chance to catch up with me on a quiet street. It refused the offer, so I shook it off and went about my business.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674/49332.html","bookId":1184,"book":{"id":1184,"title":"THE BIG SLEEP 长眠不醒","description":"简介： 一个古怪的父亲，一对儿古怪的姐妹。菲利普马洛第一次登场，面对的就是这样一个家庭。老迈而富有的将军请马洛去寻找他的女婿，他的两个女儿却一直阻止马洛采取进一步行动，花痴一样的妹妹甚至偷偷爬到马洛的床上。诱惑力十足的姐姐则送上双唇。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/15/13-51-33-47-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
