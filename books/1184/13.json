{"id":38537,"no":13,"title":"chapter 13","content":"He was a gray man, an gray, except for his polished black shoes and two scarlet diamonds in his gray satin tie that looked like the diamonds on roulette layouts. His shirt was gray and his double-breasted suit of soft, beautifully cut flannel. Seeing Carmen he took a gray hat off and his hair underneath it was gray and as fine as if it had been sifted through gauze. His thick gray eyebrows had that indefinably sporty look. He had a long chin, a nose with a hook to it, thoughtful gray eyes that had a slanted look because the fold of skin over his upper lid came down over the corner of the lid itself. He stood there politely, one hand touching the door at his back, the other holding the gray hat and flapping it gently against his thigh. He looked hard, not the hardness of the tough guy. More like the hardness of a well-weathered horseman. But he was no horseman. He was Eddie Mars. He pushed the door shut behind him and put that hand in the lap-seamed pocket of his coat and left the thumb outside to glisten in the rather dim light of the room. He smiled at Carmen. He had a nice easy smile. She licked her lips and stared at him. The fear went out of her face. She smiled back. \"Excuse the casual entrance,\" he said. \"The bell didn\u0027t seem to rouse anybody. Is Mr. Geiger around?\" I said: \"No. We don\u0027t know just where he is. We found the door a little open. We stepped inside.\" He nodded and touched his long chin with the brim of his hat. \"You\u0027re friends of his, of course?\" \"Just business acquaintances. We dropped by for a book.\" \"A book, eh?\" He said that quickly and brightly and, I thought, a little slyly, as if he knew all about Geiger\u0027s books. Then he looked at Carmen again and shrugged. I moved towards the door. \"We\u0027ll trot along now,\" I said. I took hold of her arm. She was staring at Eddie Mars. She liked him. \"Any message--if Geiger comes back?\" Eddie Mars asked gently. \"We won\u0027t bother you.\" \"That\u0027s too bad,\" he said, with too much meaning. His gray eyes twinkled and then hardened as I went past him to open the door. He added in a casual tone: \"The girl can dust. I\u0027d like to talk to you a little, soldier.\" I let go of her arm. I gave him a blank stare. \"Kidder, eh?\" he said nicely. \"Don\u0027t waste it. I\u0027ve got two boys outside in a car that always do just what I want them to.\" Carmen made a sound at my side and bolted through the door. Her steps faded rapidly down hill. I hadn\u0027t seen her car, so she must have left it down below. I started to say: \"What the hell--!\" \"Oh, skip it,\" Eddie Mars sighed. \"There\u0027s something wrong around here. I\u0027m going to find out what it is. If you want to pick lead out of your belly, get in my way.\" \"Well, well,\" I said, \"a tough guy.\" \"Only when necessary, soldier.\" He wasn\u0027t looking at me any more. He was walking around the room, frowning, not paying any attention to me. I looked out above the broken pane of the front window. The top of a car showed over the hedge. Its motor idled. Eddie Mars found the purple flagon and the two gold-veined glasses on the desk. He sniffed at one of the glasses, then at the flagon. A disgusted smile wrinkled his lips. \"The lousy pimp,\" he said tonelessly. He looked at a couple of books, grunted, went on around the desk and stood in front of the little totem pole with the camera eye. He studied it, dropped his glance to the floor in front of it. He moved the small rug with hisfoot, then bent swiftly, his body tense. He went down on the floor with one gray knee. The desk hid him from me partly. There was a sharp exclamation and he came up again. His arm flashed under his coat and a black Luger appeared in his hand. He held it in long brown fingers, not pointing it at me me, not pointing it at anything. \"Blood,\" he said. \"Blood on the floor there, under the rug. Quite a lot of blood.\" \"Is that so?\" I said, looking interested. He slid into the chair behind the desk and hooked the mulberry-colored phone towards him and shifted the Luger to his left hand. He frowned sharply at the telephone, bringing his thick gray eyebrows close together and making a hard crease in the weathered skin at the top of his hooked nose. \"I think we\u0027ll have some law,\" he said. I went over and kicked at the rug that lay where Geiger had lain. \"It\u0027s old blood,\" I said. \"Dried blood.\" \"Just the same we\u0027ll have some law.\" \"Why not?\" I said. His eyes went narrow. The veneer had flaked off him, leaving a well-dressed hard boy with a Luger. He didn\u0027t like my agreeing with him. \"Just who the hell are you, soldier?\" \"Marlowe is the name. I\u0027m a sleuth.\" \"Never heard of you. Who\u0027s the girl?\" \"Client. Geiger was trying to throw a loop on her with some blackmail. We came to talk it over. He wasn\u0027t here. The door being open we walked in to wait. Or did I tell you that?\" \"Convenient,\" he said. \"The door being open. When you didn\u0027t have a key.\" \"Yes. How come you had a key?\" \"Is that any of your business, soldier?\" \"I could make it my business.\" He smiled tightly and pushed his hat back on his gray hair. \"And I could make your business my business.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t like it. The pay\u0027s too small.\" \"All right, bright eyes. I own this house. Geiger is my tenant. Now what do you think of that?\" \"You know such lovely people.\" \"I take them as they come. They come all kinds.\" He glanced down at the Luger, shrugged and tucked it back under his arm. \"Got any good ideas, soldier?\" \"Lots of them. Somebody gunned Geiger. Somebody got gunned by Geiger, who ran away. Or it was two other fellows. Or Geiger was running a cult and made blood sacrifices in front of that totem pole. Or he had chicken for dinner and liked to kill his chickens in the front parlor.\" The gray man scowled at me. \"I give up,\" I said. \"Better call your friends downtown.\" \"I don\u0027t get it,\" he snapped. \"I don\u0027t get your game here.\" \"Go ahead, call the buttons. You\u0027ll get a big reaction from it.\" He thought that over without moving. His lips went back against his teeth. \"I don\u0027t get that, either,\" he said tightly. \"Maybe it just isn\u0027t your day. I know you, Mr. Mars. The Cypress Club at Las Olindas. Flash gambling for flash people. The local law in your pocket and a well-greased line into L.A. In other words, protection. Geiger was in a racket that needed that too. Perhaps you spared him a little now and then, seeing he\u0027s your tenant.\" His mouth became a hard white grimace. \"Geiger was in what racket?\" \"The smut book racket.\" He stared at me for a long level minute. \"Somebody got to him,\" he said softly. \"You know something about it. He didn\u0027t show at the store today. They don\u0027t know where he is. He didn\u0027t answer the phone here. I came up tosee about it. I find blood on the floor, under a rug. And you and a girl here.\" \"A little weak,\" I said. \"But maybe you can sell the story to a willing buyer. You missed a little something, though. Somebody moved his books out of the store today--the nice books he rented out.\" He snapped his fingers sharply and said: \"I should have thought of that, soldier. You seem to get around. How do you figure it?\" \"I think Geiger was rubbed. I think that is his blood. And the books being moved out gives a motive for hiding the body for a while. Somebody is taking over the racket and wants a little time to organize.\" \"They can\u0027t get away with it,\" Eddie Mars said grimly. \"Who says so? You and a couple of gunmen in your car outside? This is a big town now, Eddie. Some very tough people have checked in here lately. The penalty of growth.\" \"You talk too damned much,\" Eddie Mars said. He bared his teeth and whistled twice, sharply. A car slammed outside and running steps came through the hedge. Mars flicked the Luger out again and pointed it at my chest. \"Open the door.\" The knob rattled and a voice called out. I didn\u0027t move. The muzzle of the Luger looked like the mouth of the Second Street tunnel, but I didn\u0027t move. Not being bullet proof is an idea I had had to get used to. \"Open it yourself, Eddie. Who the hell are you to give me orders? Be nice and I might help you out.\" He came to his feet rigidly and moved around the end of the desk and over to the door. He opened it without taking his eyes off me. Two men tumbled into the room, reaching busily under their arms. One was an obvious pug, a good-looking pale-faced boy with a bad nose and one ear like a club steak. The other man was slim, blond, deadpan, with close-set eyes and no color in them. Eddie Mars said: \"See if this bird is wearing any iron.\" The blond flicked a short-barreled gun out and stood pointing it at me. The pug sidled over flatfooted and felt my pockets with care. I turned around for like a bored beauty modeling an evening gown. \"No gun,\" he said in a burry voice. \"Find out who he is.\" The pug slipped a hand into my breast pocket and drew out my wallet. He flipped it open and studied the contents. \"Name\u0027s Philip Marlowe, Eddie. Lives at the Hobart Arms on Franklin. Private license, deputy\u0027s badge and all. A shamus.\" He slipped the wallet back in my pocket, slapped my face lightly and turned away. \"Beat it,\" Eddie Mars said. The two gunmen went out again and closed the door. There was the sound of them getting back into the car. They started its motor and kept it idling once more. \"All right. Talk,\" Eddie Mars snapped. The peaks of his eyebrows made sharp angles against his forehead. \"I\u0027m not ready to give out. Killing Geiger to grab his racket would be a dumb trick and I\u0027m not sure it happened that way, assuming he has been killed. But I\u0027m sure that whoever got the books knows what\u0027s what, and I\u0027m sure that the blonde lady down at his store is scared batty about something or other. And I have a guess who got the books.\" \"Who?\" \"That\u0027s the part I\u0027m not ready to give out. I\u0027ve got a client, you know.\" He wrinkled his nose. \"That--\" he chopped it off quickly. \"I expected you would know the girl,\" I said. \"Who got the books, soldier?\" \"Not ready to talk, Eddie. Why should I?\" He put the Luger down on the desk and slapped it with his open palm. \"This,\" he said. \"And I might make it worth your while.\"\"That\u0027s the spirit. Leave the gun out of it. I can always hear the sound of money. How much are you clinking at me?\" \"For doing what?\" \"What did you want done?\" He slammed the desk hard. \"Listen, soldier. I ask you a question and you ask me another. We\u0027re not getting anywhere. I want to know where Geiger is, for my own personal reasons. I didn\u0027t like his racket and I didn\u0027t protect him. I happen to own this house. I\u0027m not so crazy about that right now. I can believe that whatever you know about all this is under glass, or there would be a flock of johns squeaking sole leather around this dump. You haven\u0027t got anything to sell. My guess is you need a little protection yourself. So cough up.\" It was a good guess, but I wasn\u0027t going to let him know it. I lit a cigarette and blew the match out and flicked it at the glass eye of the totem pole. \"You\u0027re right,\" I said. \"If anything has happened to Geiger, I\u0027ll have to give what I have to the law. Which puts it in the public domain and doesn\u0027t leave me anything to sell. So with your permission I\u0027ll just drift.\" His face whitened under the tan. He looked mean, fast and tough for a moment. He made a movement to lift the gun. I added casually: \"By the way, how is Mrs. Mars these days?\" I thought for a moment I had kidded him a little too far. His hand jerked at the gun, shaking. His face was stretched out by hard muscles. \"Beat it,\" he said quite softly. \"I don\u0027t give a damn where you go or what you do when you get there. Only take a word of advice, soldier. Leave me out of your plans or you\u0027ll wish your name was Murphy and you lived in Limerick.\" \"Well, that\u0027s not so far from Clonmel,\" I said. \"I hear you had a pal came from there.\" He leaned down on the desk, frozen-eyed, unmoving. I went over to the door and opened it and looked back at him. His eyes had followed me, but his lean gray body had not moved. There was hate in his eyes. I went out and through the hedge and up the hill to my car and got into it. I turned it around and drove up over the crest. Nobody shot at me. After a few blocks I turned off, cut the motor and sat for a few moments. Nobody followed me either. I drove back into Hollywood.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674/49325.html","bookId":1184,"book":{"id":1184,"title":"THE BIG SLEEP 长眠不醒","description":"简介： 一个古怪的父亲，一对儿古怪的姐妹。菲利普马洛第一次登场，面对的就是这样一个家庭。老迈而富有的将军请马洛去寻找他的女婿，他的两个女儿却一直阻止马洛采取进一步行动，花痴一样的妹妹甚至偷偷爬到马洛的床上。诱惑力十足的姐姐则送上双唇。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/15/13-51-33-47-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
