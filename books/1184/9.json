{"id":38533,"no":9,"title":"chapter 9","content":"The next morning was bright, clear and sunny. I woke up with a motorman\u0027s glove in my mouth, drank two cups of coffee and went through the morning papers. I didn\u0027t find any reference to Mr. Arthur Gwynn Geiger in either of them. I was shaking the wrinkles out of my damp suit when the phone rang. It was Bernie Ohls, the D.A.\u0027s chief investigator, who had given me the lead to General Sternwood. \"Well, how\u0027s the boy?\" he began. He sounded like a man who had slept well and didn\u0027t owe too much money. \"I\u0027ve got a hangover,\" I said. \"Tsk, tsk.\" He laughed absently and then his voice became a shade too casual, a cagey cop voice. \"SeenGeneral Sternwood yet?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Done anything for him?\" \"Too much rain,\" I answered, if that was an answer. \"They seem to be a family things happen to. A big Buick belonging to one of them is washing about in the surf off Lido fish pier.\" I held the telephone tight enough to crack it. I also held my breath. \"Yeah,\" Ohls said cheerfully. \"A nice new Buick sedan all messed up with sand and sea water . . . Oh, I almost forgot. There\u0027s a guy inside it.\" I let my breath out so slowly that it hung on my lip. \"Regan?\" I asked. \"Huh? Who? Oh, you mean the ex-legger the eldest girl picked up and went and married. I never saw him. What would he be doing down there?\" \"Quit stalling. What would anybody be doing down there?\" \"I don\u0027t know, pal. I\u0027m dropping down to look see. Want to go along?\" \"Yes.\" \"Snap it up,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be in my hutch.\" Shaved, dressed and lightly breakfasted I was at the Hall of Justice in less than an hour. I rode up to the seventh floor and went along to the group of small offices used by the D.A.\u0027s men. Ohls\u0027 was no larger than the others, but he had it to himself. There was nothing on his desk but a blotter, a cheap pen set, his hat and one of his feet. He was a medium-sized blondish man with stiff white eyebrows, calm eyes and well-kept teeth. He looked like anybody you would pass on the street. I happened to know he had killed nine men--three of them when he was covered, or somebody thought he was. He stood up and pocketed a flat tin of toy cigars called Entractes, jiggled the one in his mouth up and down and looked at me carefully along his nose, with his head thrown back. \"It\u0027s not Regan,\" he said. \"I checked. Regan\u0027s a big guy, as tail as you and a shade heavier. This is a young kid.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. \"What made Regan skip out?\" Ohls asked. \"You interested in that?\" \"I don\u0027t think so,\" I said. \"When a guy out of the liquor traffic marries into a rich family and then waves good-by to a pretty dame and a couple million legitimate bucks--that\u0027s enough to make even me think. I guess you thought that was a secret.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Okey, keep buttoned, kid. No hard feelings.\" He came around the desk tapping his pockets and reaching for his hat. \"I\u0027m not looking for Regan,\" I said. He fixed the lock on his door and we went down to the official parking lot and got into a small blue sedan. We drove out Sunset, using the siren once in a while to beat a signal. It was a crisp morning, with just enough snap in the air to make life seem simple and sweet, if you didn\u0027t have too much on your mind. I had. It was thirty miles to Lido on the coast highway, the first ten of them through traffic. Ohls made the run in three quarters of an hour. At the end of that time we skidded to a stop in front of a faded stucco arch and I took my feet out of the floorboards and we got out. A long pier railed with white two-by-fours stretched seaward from the arch. A knot of people leaned out at the far end and a motorcycle officer stood under the arch keeping another group of people from going out on the pier. Cars were parked on both sides of the highway, the usual ghouls, ofboth sexes. Ohls showed the motorcycle officer his badge and we went out on the pier, into a loud fish smell which one night\u0027s hard rain hadn\u0027t even dented. \"There she is--on the power barge,\" Ohls said, pointing with one of his toy cigars. A low black barge with a wheelhouse like a tug\u0027s was crouched against the pilings at the end of the pier. Something that glistened in the morning sunlight was on its deck, with hoist chains still around it, a large black and chromium car. The arm of the hoist had been swung back into position and lowered to deck level. Men stood around the car. We went down slippery steps to the deck. Ohls said hello to a deputy in green khaki and a man in plain clothes. The barge crew of three men leaned against the front of the wheelhouse and chewed tobacco. One of them was rubbing at his wet hair with a dirty bath-towel. That would be the man who had gone down into the water to put the chains on. We looked the car over. The front bumper was bent, one headlight smashed, the other bent up but the glass still unbroken. The radiator shell had a big dent in it, and the paint and nickel were scratched up all over the car. The upholstery was sodden and black. None of the tires seemed to be damaged. The driver was still draped around the steering post with his head at an unnatural angle to his shoulders. He was a slim dark-haired kid who had been good-looking not so long ago. Now his face was bluish white and his eyes were a faint dull gleam under the lowered lids and his open-mouth had sand in it. On the left side of his forehead there was a dull bruise that stood out against the whiteness of the skin. Ohls backed away, made a noise in his throat and put a match to his little cigar. \"What\u0027s the story?\" The uniformed man pointed up at the rubbernecks on the end of the pier. One of them was fingering a place where the white two-by-fours had been broken through in a wide space. The splintered wood showed yellow and clean, like fresh-cut pine. \"Went through there. Must have hit pretty hard. The rain stopped early down here, around nine p.m. The broken wood\u0027s dry inside. That puts it after the rain stopped. She fell in plenty of water not to be banged up worse, not more than half tide or she\u0027d have drifted farther, and not more than half tide going out or she\u0027d have crowded the piles. That makes it around ten last night. Maybe nine-thirty, not earlier. She shows under the water when the boys come down to fish this morning, so we get the barge to hoist her out and we find the dead guy.\" The plainclothesman scuffed at the deck with the toe of his shoe. Ohls looked sideways along his eyes at me, and twitched his little cigar like a cigarette. \"Drunk?\" he asked, of nobody in particular. The man who had been toweling his head went over to the rail and cleared his throat in a loud hawk that made everybody look at him. \"Got some sand,\" he said, and spat. \"Not as much as the boy friend got--but some.\" The uniformed man said: \"Could have been drunk. Showing off all alone in the rain. Drunks will do anything.\" \"Drunk, hell,\" the plainclothesman said. \"The hand throttle\u0027s set halfway down and the guy\u0027s been sapped on the side of the head. Ask me and I\u0027ll call it murder.\" Ohls looked at the man with the towel. \"What do you think, buddy?\" The man with the towel looked flattered. He grinned. \"I say suicide, Mac. None of my business, but you ask me, I say suicide. First off the guy plowed an awful straight furrow down that pier. You can read his tread marks all the way nearly. That puts it after the rain like the Sheriff said. Then he hit the pier hard and clean or he don\u0027t go through and land right side up. More likely turned over a couple of times. So he had plenty of speed and hit the rail square. That\u0027s more than half-throttle. He could have done that with his hand falling and he could have hurt his head falling too.\" Ohls said: \"You got eyes, buddy. Frisked him?\" he asked the deputy. The deputy looked at me, then at the crew against the wheelhouse. \"Okey, save that,\" Ohls said. \n A small man with glasses and a tired face and a black bag came down the steps from the pier. He picked out a fairly clean spot on the deck and put the bag down. Then he took his hat off and rubbed the back of his neck and stared out to sea, as if he didn\u0027t know where he was or what he had come for. Ohls said: \"There\u0027s your customer, Doc. Dove off the pier last night. Around nine to ten. That\u0027s all we know.\" The small man looked in at the dead man morosely. He fingered the head, peered at the bruise on the temple, moved the head around with both hands, felt the man\u0027s ribs. He lifted a lax dead hand and stared at the fingernails. He let it fall and watched it fall. He stepped back and opened his bag and took out a printed pad of D.O.A. forms and began to write over a carbon. \"Broken neck\u0027s the apparent cause of death,\" he said, writing. \"Which means there won\u0027t be much water in him. Which means he\u0027s due to start getting stiff pretty quick now he\u0027s out in the air. Better get him out of the car before he does. You won\u0027t like doing it after.\" Ohls nodded. \"How long dead, Doc?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t know.\" Ohls looked at him sharply and took the little cigar out of his mouth and looked at that sharply. \"Pleased to know you, Doc. A coroner\u0027s man that can\u0027t guess within five minutes has me beat.\" The little man grinned sourly and put his pad in his bag and clipped his pencil back on his vest. \"If he ate dinner last night, I\u0027ll tell you--if I know what time he ate it. But not within five minutes.\" \"How would he get that bruise--falling?\" The little man looked at the bruise again. \"I don\u0027t think so. That blow came from something covered. And it had already bled subcutaneously while he was alive.\" \"Blackjack, huh?\" \"Very likely.\" The little M.E.\u0027s man nodded, picked his bag off deck and went back up the steps to the pier. An ambulance was backing into position outside the stucco arch. Ohls looked at me and said: \"Let\u0027s go. Hardly worth the ride, was it?\" We went back along the pier and got into Ohls\u0027 sedan again. He wrestled it around on the highway and drove back towards town along a three-lane highway washed clean by the rain, past low rolling hills of yellow-white sand terraced with pink moss. Seaward a few gulls wheeled and swooped over something in the surf and far out a white yacht looked as if it was hanging in the sky. Ohls cocked his chin at me and said: \"Know him?\" \"Sure. The Sternwood chauffeur. I saw him dusting that very car out there yesterday.\" \"I don\u0027t want to crowd you, Marlowe. Just tell me, did the job have anything to do with him?\" \"No. I don\u0027t even know his name.\" \"Owen Taylor. How do I know? Funny about that. About a year or so back we had him in the cooler on a Mann Act rap. It seems he run Sternwood\u0027s hotcha daughter, the young one, off to Yuma. The sister ran after them and brought them back and had Owen heaved into the icebox. Then next day she comes down to the D.A. and gets him to beg the kid off with the U. S. \u0027cutor. She says the kid meant to marry her sister and wanted to, only the sister can\u0027t see it. All she wanted was to kick a few high ones off the bar and have herself a party. So we let the kid go and then darned if they don\u0027t have him come back to work. And a little later we get the routine report on his prints from Washington, and he\u0027s got a prior back in Indiana, attempted hold-up six years ago. He got off with a six months in the county jail, the very one Dillinger bust out of. We hand that to the Sternwoods and they keep him on just the same. What do you think of that?\" \"They seem to be a screwy family,\" I said. \"Do they know about last night?\"\"No. I gotta go up against them now.\" \"Leave the old man out of it, if you can.\" \"Why?\" \"He has enough troubles and he\u0027s sick.\" \"You mean Regan?\" I scowled. \"I don\u0027t know anything about Regan, I told you. I\u0027m not looking for Regan. Regan hasn\u0027t bothered anybody that I know of.\" Ohls said: \"Oh,\" and stared thoughtfully out to sea and the sedan nearly went off the road. For the rest of the drive back to town he hardly spoke. He dropped me off in Hollywood near the Chinese Theater and turned back west to Alta Brea Crescent. I ate lunch at a counter and looked at an afternoon paper and couldn\u0027t find anything about Geiger in it. After lunch I walked east on the boulevard to have another look at Geiger\u0027s store. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674/49321.html","bookId":1184,"book":{"id":1184,"title":"THE BIG SLEEP 长眠不醒","description":"简介： 一个古怪的父亲，一对儿古怪的姐妹。菲利普马洛第一次登场，面对的就是这样一个家庭。老迈而富有的将军请马洛去寻找他的女婿，他的两个女儿却一直阻止马洛采取进一步行动，花痴一样的妹妹甚至偷偷爬到马洛的床上。诱惑力十足的姐姐则送上双唇。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/15/13-51-33-47-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
