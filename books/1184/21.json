{"id":38545,"no":21,"title":"chapter 21","content":"I didn\u0027t go near the Sternwood family. I went back to the office and sat in my swivel chair and tried to catch up on my foot-dangling. There was a gusty wind blowing in at the windows and the soot from the oil burners of the hotel next door was down-drafted into the room and rolling across the top of the desk like tumbleweed drifting across a vacant lot. I was thinking about going out to lunch and that life was pretty flat and that it would probably be just as flat if I took a drink and that taking a drink all alone at that time of day wouldn\u0027t be any fun anyway. I was thinking this when Norris called up. In his carefully polite manner he said that General Sternwood was not feeling very well and that certain items in the newspaper had been read to him and he assumed that my investigation was now completed. \"Yes, as regards Geiger,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t shoot him, you know.\" \"The General didn\u0027t suppose you did, Mr. Marlowe.\" \"Does the General know anything about those photographs Mrs. Regan was worrying about?\" \"No, sir. Decidedly not.\" \"Did you know what the General gave me?\" \"Yes, sir. Three notes and a card, I believe.\" \"Right. I\u0027ll return them. As to the photos I think I\u0027d better just destroy them.\" \"Very good, sir. Mrs. Regan tried to reach you a number of times last night--\" \"I was out getting drunk,\" I said. \"Yes. Very necessary, sir, I\u0027m sure. The General has instructed me to send you a check for five hundred dollars. Will that be satisfactory?\" \"More than generous,\" I said. \"And I presume we may now consider the incident closed?\" \"Oh sure. Tight as a vault with a busted time lock.\"\"Thank you, sir. I am sure we all appreciate it. When the General is feeling a little better--possibly tomorrow--he would like to thank you in person.\" \"Fine,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll come out and drink some more of his brandy, maybe with champagne.\" \"I shall see that some is properly iced,\" the old boy said, almost with a smirk in his voice. That was that. We said good-by and hung up. The coffee shop smell from next door came in at the windows with the soot but failed to make me hungry. So I got out my office bottle and took the drink and let my self-respect ride its own race. I counted it up on my fingers. Rusty Regan had run away from a lot of money and a handsome wife to go wandering with a vague blonde who was more or less married to a racketeer named Eddie Mars. He had gone suddenly without good-bys and there might be any number of reasons for that. The General had been too proud, or, at the first interview he gave me, too careful, to tell me the Missing Persons Bureau had the matter in hand. The Missing Persons people were dead on their feet on it and evidently didn\u0027t think it worth bothering over. Regan had done what he had done and that was his business. I agreed with Captain Gregory that Eddie Mars would have been very unlikely to involve himself in a double murder just because another man had gone to town with the blonde he was not even living with. It might have annoyed him, but business is business, and you have to hold your teeth clamped around Hollywood to keep from chewing on stray blondes. If there had been a lot of money involved, that would be different. But fifteen grand wouldn\u0027t be a lot of money to Eddie Mars. He was no two-bit chiseler like Brody. Geiger was dead and Carmen would have to find some other shady character to drink exotic blends of hootch with. I didn\u0027t suppose she would have any trouble. All she would have to do would be to stand on the corner for five minutes and look coy. I hoped that the next grifter who dropped the hook on her would play her a little more smoothly, a little more for the long haul rather than the quick touch. Mrs. Regan knew Eddie Mars well enough to borrow money from him. That was natural, if she played roulette and was a good loser. Any gambling house owner would lend a good client money in a pinch. Apart from this they had an added bond of interest in Regan. He was her husband and he had gone off with Eddie Mars\u0027 wife. Carol Lundgren, the boy killer with the limited vocabulary, was out of circulation for a long, long time, even if they didn\u0027t strap him in a chair over a bucket of acid. They wouldn\u0027t, because he would take a plea and save the county money. They all do when they don\u0027t have the price of a big lawyer. Agnes Lozelle was in custody as a material witness. They wouldn\u0027t need her for that, if Carol took a plea, and if he pleaded guilty on arraignment, they would turn her loose. They wouldn\u0027t want to open up any angles on Geiger\u0027s business, apart from which they had nothing on her. That left me. I had concealed a murder and suppressed evidence for twenty-four hours, but I was still at large and had a five-hundred-dollar check coming. The smart thing for me to do was to take another drink and forget the whole mess. That being the obviously smart thing to do, I called Eddie Mars and told him I was coming down to Las Olindas that evening to talk to him. That was how smart I was. I got down there about nine, under a hard high October moon that lost itself in the top layers of a beach fog. The Cypress Club was at the far end of the town, a rambling frame mansion that had once been the summer residence of a rich man named De Cazens, and later had been a hotel. It was now a big dark outwardly shabby place in a thick grove of wind-twisted Monterey cypresses, which gave it its name. It had enormous scrolled porches, turrets all over the place, stained-glass trims around the big windows, big empty stables at the back, a general air of nostalgic decay. Eddie Mars had left the outside much as he had found it, instead of making it over to look like an MGM set. I left my car on a street with sputtering arc lights and walked into the grounds along adamp gravel path to the main entrance. A doorman in a doublebreasted guard\u0027s coat let me into a huge dim silent lobby from which a white oak staircase curved majestically up to the darkness of an upper floor. I checked my hat and coat and waited, listening to music and confused voices behind heavy double doors. They seemed a long way off, and not quite of the same world as the building itself. Then the slim pasty-faced blond man who had been with Eddie Mars and the pug at Geiger\u0027s place came through a door under the staircase, smiled at me bleakly and took me back with him along a carpeted hail to the boss\u0027s office. This was a square room with a deep old bay window and a stone fireplace in which a fire of juniper logs burned lazily. It was wainscoted in walnut and had a frieze of faded damask above the paneling. The ceiling was high and remote. There was a smell of cold sea. Eddie Mars\u0027 dark sheenless desk didn\u0027t belong in the room, but neither did anything made after 1900. His carpet had a Florida suntan. There was a bartop radio in the corner and a S鑦 res china tea set on a copper tray beside a samovar. I wondered who that was for. There was a door in the corner that had a time lock on it. Eddie Mars grinned at me sociably and shook hands and moved his chin at the vault. \"I\u0027m a pushover for a heist mob here except for that thing,\" he said cheerfully. \"The local johns drop in every morning and watch me open it. I have an arrangement with them.\" \"You hinted you had something for me,\" I said. \"What is it?\" \"What\u0027s your hurry? Have a drink and sit down.\" \"No hurry at all. You and I haven\u0027t anything to talk about but business.\" \"You\u0027ll have the drink and like it,\" he said. He mixed a couple and put mine down beside a red leather chair and stood crosslegged against the desk himself, one hand in the side pocket of his midnight-blue dinner jacket, the thumb outside and the nail glistening. In dinner clothes he looked a little harder than in gray flannel, but he still looked like a horseman. We drank and nodded at each other. \"Ever been here before?\" he asked. \"During prohibition. I don\u0027t get any kick out of gambling.\" \"Not with money,\" he smiled. \"You ought to look in tonight. One of your friends is outside betting the wheels. I hear she\u0027s doing pretty well. Vivian Regan.\" I sipped my drink and took one of his monogrammed cigarettes. \"I kind of liked the way you handled that yesterday,\" he said. \"You made me sore at the time but I could see afterwards how right you were. You and I ought to get along. How much do I owe you?\" \"For doing what?\" \"Still careful, eh? I have my pipe line into headquarters, or I wouldn\u0027t be here. I get them the way they happen, not the way you read them in the papers.\" He showed me his large white teeth. \"How much have you got?\" I asked. \"You\u0027re not talking money?\" \"Information was the way I understood it.\" \"Information about what?\" \"You have a short memory. Regan.\" \"Oh, that.\" He waved his glistening nails in the quiet light from one of those bronze lamps that shoot a beam at the ceiling. \"I hear you got the information already. I felt I owed you a fee. I\u0027m used to paying for nice treatment.\" \"I didn\u0027t drive down here to make a touch. I get paid for what I do. Not much by your standards, but I make out. One customer at a time is a good rule. You didn\u0027t bump Regan off, did you?\" \"No. Did you think I did?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t put it past you.\"He laughed. \"You\u0027re kidding.\" I laughed. \"Sure, I\u0027m kidding. I never saw Regan, but I saw his photo. You haven\u0027t got the men for the work. And while we\u0027re on that subject don\u0027t send me any more gun punks with orders. I might get hysterical and blow one down.\" He looked through his glass at the fire, set it down on the end of the desk and wiped his lips with a sheer lawn handkerchief. \"You talk a good game,\" he said. \"But I dare say you can break a hundred and ten. You\u0027re not really interested in Regan, are you?\" \"No, not professionally. I haven\u0027t been asked to be. But I know somebody who would like to know where he is.\" \"She doesn\u0027t give a damn,\" he said. \"I mean her father.\" He wiped his lips again and looked at the handkerchief almost as if he expected to find blood on it. He drew his thick gray eyebrows close together and fingered the side of his weatherbeaten nose. \"Geiger was trying to blackmail the General,\" I said. \"The General wouldn\u0027t say so, but I figure he was at least half scared Regan might be behind it.\" Eddie Mars laughed. \"Uh-uh. Geiger worked that one on everybody. It was strictly his own idea. He\u0027d get notes from people that looked legal--were legal, I dare say, except that he wouldn\u0027t have dared sue on them. He\u0027d present the notes, with a nice flourish, leaving himself empty-handed. If he drew an ace, he had a prospect that scared and he went to work. If he didn\u0027t draw an ace, he just dropped the whole thing.\" \"Clever guy,\" I said. \"He dropped it all right. Dropped it and fell on it. How come you know all this?\" He shrugged impatiently. \"I wish to Christ I didn\u0027t know half the stuff that\u0027s brought to me. Knowing other people\u0027s business is the worst investment a man can make in my circle. Then if it was just Geiger you were after, you\u0027re washed up on that angle.\" \"Washed up and paid off.\" \"I\u0027m sorry about that. I wish old Sternwood would hire himself a soldier like you on a straight salary, to keep those girls of his home at least a few nights a week.\" \"Why?\" His mouth looked sulky. \"They\u0027re plain trouble. Take the dark one. She\u0027s a pain in the neck around here. If she loses, she plunges and I end up with a fistful of paper which nobody will discount at any price. She has no money of her own except an allowance and what\u0027s in the old man\u0027s will is a secret. If she wins, she takes my money home with her.\" \"You get it back the next night,\" I said. \"I get some of it back. But over a period of time I\u0027m loser.\" He looked earnestly at me, as if that was important to me. I wondered why he thought it necessary to tell me at all. I yawned and finished my drink. \"I\u0027m going out and look the joint over,\" I said. \"Yes, do.\" He pointed to a door near the vault door. \"That leads to a door behind the tables.\" \"I\u0027d rather go in the way the suckers enter.\" \"Okey. As you please. We\u0027re friends, aren\u0027t we, soldier?\" \"Sure.\" I stood up and we shook hands. \"Maybe I can do you a real favor some day,\" he said. \"You got it all from Gregory this time.\" \"So you own a piece of him too.\"\"Oh not that bad. We\u0027re just friends.\" I stared at him for a moment, then went over to the door I had come in at. I looked back at him when I had it open. \"You don\u0027t have anybody tailing me around in a gray Plymouth sedan, do you?\" His eyes widened sharply. He looked jarred. \"Hell, no. Why should I?\" \"I couldn\u0027t imagine,\" I said, and went on out. I thought his surprise looked genuine enough to be believed. I thought he even looked a little worried. I couldn\u0027t think of any reason for that. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674/49333.html","bookId":1184,"book":{"id":1184,"title":"THE BIG SLEEP 长眠不醒","description":"简介： 一个古怪的父亲，一对儿古怪的姐妹。菲利普马洛第一次登场，面对的就是这样一个家庭。老迈而富有的将军请马洛去寻找他的女婿，他的两个女儿却一直阻止马洛采取进一步行动，花痴一样的妹妹甚至偷偷爬到马洛的床上。诱惑力十足的姐姐则送上双唇。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/15/13-51-33-47-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
