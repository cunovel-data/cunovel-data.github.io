{"id":38548,"no":24,"title":"chapter 24","content":"The apartment house lobby was empty this time. No gunman waiting under the potted palm to give me orders. I took the automatic elevator up to my floor and walked along the hallway to the tune of a muted radio behind a door. I needed a drink and was in a hurry to get one. I didn\u0027t switch the light on inside the door. I made straight for the kitchenette and brought up short in three or four feet. Something was wrong. Something on the air, a scent. The shades were down at the windows and the street light leaking in at the sides made a dim light in the room. I stood still and listened. The scent on the air was a perfume, a heavy cloying perfume. There was no sound, no sound at all. Then my eyes adjusted themselves more to the darkness and I saw there was something across the floor in front of me that shouldn\u0027t have been there. I backed, reached the wall switch with my thumb and flicked the light on. The bed was down. Something in it giggled. A blonde head was pressed into my pillow. Two bare arms curved up and the hands belonging to them were clasped on top of the blond head. Carmen Sternwood on her back, in my bed, giggling at me. The tawny wave of her hair was spread out on the pillow as if by careful and artificial hand. Her slaty eyes peered me and had the effect, as usual, of peering from behind a barrel. She smiled. Her small sharp teeth glinted. \"Cute, aren\u0027t I?\" she said. I said harshly: \"Cute as a Filipino on Saturday night.\" I went over to a floor lamp and pulled the switch, went back to put off the ceiling light, and went across the room again to the chessboard on a card table under the lamp. There was a problem laid out on the board, a six-mover. I couldn\u0027t solve it, like a lot of my problems. I reached down and moved a knight, then pulled my hat and coat off and threw them somewhere. All this time the soft giggling went on from the bed, that sound that made me think of rats behind a wainscoting in an old house. \"I bet you can\u0027t even guess how I got in.\" I dug a cigarette out and looked at her with bleak eyes. \"I bet I can. You came through the keyhole, just like Peter Pan.\" \"Who\u0027s he?\" \"Oh, a fellow I used to know around the poolroom.\" She giggled. \"You\u0027re cute, aren\u0027t you?\" she said. I began to say: \"About that thumb--\" but she was ahead of me. I didn\u0027t have to remind her. She took herright hand from behind her head and started sucking the thumb and eyeing me with very round and naughty eyes. \"I\u0027m all undressed,\" she said, after I had smoked and stared at her for a minute. \"By God,\" I said, \"it was right at the back of my mind. I was groping for it. I almost had it, when you spoke. In another minute I\u0027d have said \u0027I bet you\u0027re all undressed.\u0027 I always wear my rubbers in bed myself in case I wake up with a bad conscience and have to sneak away from it.\" \"You\u0027re cute.\" She rolled her head a little, kittenishly. Then she took her left hand from under her head and took hold of the covers, paused dramatically, and swept them aside. She was undressed all right. She lay there on the bed in the lamplight, as naked and glistening as a pearl. The Sternwood girls were giving me both barrels that night. I pulled a shred of tobacco off the edge of my lower lip. \"That\u0027s nice,\" I said. \"But I\u0027ve already seen it all. Remember? I\u0027m the guy that keeps finding you without any clothes on.\" She giggled some more and covered herself up again. \"Well, how did you get in?\" I asked her. \"The manager let me in. I showed him your card. I\u0027d stolen it from Vivian. I told him you told me to come here and wait for you. I was--I was mysterious.\" She glowed with delight. \"Neat,\" I said. \"Managers are like that. Now I know how you got in, tell me how you\u0027re going to go out.\" She giggled. \"Not going--not for a long time. . . . I like it here. You\u0027re cute.\" \"Listen,\" I pointed my cigarette at her. \"Don\u0027t make me dress you again. I\u0027m tired. I appreciate all you\u0027re offering me. It\u0027s just more than I could possibly take. Doghouse Reilly never let a pal down that way. I\u0027m your friend. I won\u0027t let you down--in spite of yourself. You and I have to keep on being friends, and this isn\u0027t the way to do it. Now will you dress like a nice little girl?\" She shook her head from side to side. \"Listen,\" I plowed on, \"you don\u0027t really care anything about me. You\u0027re just showing how naughty you can be. But you don\u0027t have to show me. I knew it already. I\u0027m the guy that found--\" \"Put the light out,\" she giggled. I threw my cigarette on the floor and stamped on it. I took a handkerchief out and wiped the palms of my hands. I tried it once more. \"It isn\u0027t on account of the neighbors,\" I told her. \"They don\u0027t really care a lot. There\u0027s a lot of stray broads in any apartment house and one more won\u0027t make the building rock. It\u0027s a question of professional pride. You know--professional pride. I\u0027m working for your father. He\u0027s a sick man, very frail, very helpless. He sort of trusts me not to pull any stunts. Won\u0027t you please get dressed, Carmen?\" \"Your name isn\u0027t Doghouse Reilly,\" she said. \"It\u0027s Philip Marlowe. You can\u0027t fool me.\" I looked down at the chessboard. The move with the knight was wrong. I put it back where I had moved it from. Knights had no meaning in this game. It wasn\u0027t a game for knights. I looked at her again. She lay still now, her face pale against the pillow, her eyes large and dark and empty as rain barrels in a drought. One of her small five-fingered thumbless hands picked at the cover restlessly. There was a vague glimmer of doubt starting to get born in her somewhere. She didn\u0027t know about it yet. It\u0027s so hard for women--even nice women--to realize that their bodies are not irresistible. I said: \"I\u0027m going out in the kitchen and mix a drink. Want one?\" \"Uh-huh.\" Dark silent mystified eyes stared at me solemnly, the doubt growing larger in them, creeping into them noiselessly, like a cat in long grass stalking a young blackbird. \"If you\u0027re dressed when I get back, you\u0027ll get the drink. Okey?\" Her teeth parted and a faint hissing noise came out of her mouth. She didn\u0027t answer me. I went out to the kitchenette and got out some Scotch and fizzwater and mixed a couple of highballs. I didn\u0027t have anything reallyexciting to drink, like nitroglycerin or distilled tiger\u0027s breath. She hadn\u0027t moved when I got back with the glasses. The hissing had stopped. Her eyes were dead again. Her lips started to smile at me. Then she sat up suddenly and threw all the covers off her body and reached. \"Gimme.\" \"When you\u0027re dressed. Not until you\u0027re dressed.\" I put the two glasses down on the card table and sat down myself and lit another cigarette. \"Go ahead. I won\u0027t watch you.\" I looked away. Then I was aware of the hissing noise very sudden and sharp. It startled me into looking at her again. She sat there naked, propped on her hands, her mouth open a little, her face like scraped bone. The hissing noise came tearing out of her mouth as if she had nothing to do with it. There was something behind her eyes, blank as they were, that I had never seen in a woman\u0027s eyes. Then her lips moved very slowly and carefully, as if they were artificial lips and had to be manipulated with springs. She called me a filthy name. I didn\u0027t mind that. I didn\u0027t mind what she called me, what anybody called me. But this was the room I had to live in. It was all I had in the way of a home. In it was everything that was mine, that had any association for me, any past, anything that took the place of a family. Not much; a few books, pictures, radio, chessmen, old letters, stuff like that. Nothing. Such as they were they had all my memories. I couldn\u0027t stand her in that room any longer. What she called me only reminded me of that. I said carefully: \"I\u0027ll give you three minutes to get dressed and out of here. If you\u0027re not out by then, I\u0027ll throw you out--by force. Just the way you are, naked. And I\u0027ll throw your clothes after you into the hall. Now-get started.\" Her teeth chattered and the hissing noise was sharp and animal. She swung her feet to the floor and reached for her clothes on a chair beside the bed. She dressed. I watched her. She dressed with stiff awkward fingers--for a woman--but quickly at that. She was dressed in a little over two minutes. I timed it. She stood there beside the bed, holding a green bag tight against a fur-trimmed coat. She wore a rakish green hat crooked on her head. She stood there for a moment and hissed at me, her face still like scraped bone, her eyes still empty and yet full of some jungle emotion. Then she walked quickly to the door and opened it and went out, without speaking, without looking back. I heard the elevator lurch into motion and move in the shaft. I walked to the windows and pulled the shades up and opened the windows wide. The night air came drifting in with a kind of stale sweetness that still remembered automobile exhausts and the streets of the city. I reached for my drink and drank it slowly. The apartment house door closed itself down below me. Steps tinkled on the quiet sidewalk. A car started up not far away. It rushed off into the night with a rough clashing of gears. I went back to the bed and looked down at it. The imprint of her head was still in the pifiow, of her small corrupt body still on the sheets. I put my empty glass down and tore the bed to pieces savagely. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674/49336.html","bookId":1184,"book":{"id":1184,"title":"THE BIG SLEEP 长眠不醒","description":"简介： 一个古怪的父亲，一对儿古怪的姐妹。菲利普马洛第一次登场，面对的就是这样一个家庭。老迈而富有的将军请马洛去寻找他的女婿，他的两个女儿却一直阻止马洛采取进一步行动，花痴一样的妹妹甚至偷偷爬到马洛的床上。诱惑力十足的姐姐则送上双唇。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/15/13-51-33-47-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
