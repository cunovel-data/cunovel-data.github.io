{"id":38534,"no":10,"title":"chapter 10","content":"The lean black-eyed credit jeweler was standing in his entrance in the same position as the afternoon before. He gave me the same knowing look as I turned in. The store looked just the same. The same lamp glowed on the small desk in the corner and the same ash blonde in the same black suede-like dress got up from behind it and came towards me with the same tentative smile on her face. \"Was it--?\" she said and stopped. Her silver nails twitched at her side. There was an overtone of strain in her smile. It wasn\u0027t a smile at all. It was a grimace. She just thought it was a smile. \"Back again,\" I chirped airily, and waved a cigarette. \"Mr. Geiger in today?\" \"I\u0027m--I\u0027m afraid not. No--I\u0027m afraid not. Let me see--you wanted. . .\" I took my dark glasses off and tapped them delicately on the inside of my left wrist. If you can weigh a hundred and ninety pounds and look like a fairy, I was doing my best. \"That was just a stall about those first editions,\" I whispered. \"I have to be careful. I\u0027ve got something he\u0027ll want. Something he\u0027s wanted for a long time.\" The silver fingernails touched the blond hair over one small jet-buttoned ear. \"Oh, a salesman,\" she said. \"Well--you might come in tomorrow. I think he\u0027ll be here tomorrow.\" \"drop the veil,\" I said. \"I\u0027m in the business too.\" Her eyes narrowed until they were a faint greenish glitter, like a forest pool far back in the shadow of trees. Her fingers clawed at her palm. She stared at me and chopped off a breath. \"Is he sick? I could go up to the house,\" I said impatiently, \"I haven\u0027t got forever.\" \"You--a--you--a--\" her throat jammed. I thought she was going to fall on her nose. Her whole body shivered and her face fell apart like a bride\u0027s pie crust. She put it together again slowly, as if lifting a great weight, by sheer will power. The smile came back, with a couple of corners badly bent. \"No,\" she breathed. \"No. He\u0027s out of town. That-- wouldn\u0027t be any use. Can\u0027t you--come in--tomorrow?\" I had my mouth open to say something when the partition door opened a foot. The tall dark handsome boy in the jerkin looked out, pale-faced and tightlipped, saw me, shut the door quickly again, but not before I had seen on the floor behind him a lot of wooden boxes lined with newspapers and packed loosely with books. A man in very new overalls was fussing with them. Some of Geiger\u0027s stock was being moved out. When the door shut I put my dark glasses on again and touched my hat. \"Tomorrow, then. I\u0027d like to give you a card, but you know how it is.\"\"Ye-es. I know how it is.\" She shivered a little more and made a faint sucking noise between her bright lips. I went out of the store and west on the boulevard to the corner and north on the street to the alley which ran behind the stores. A small black truck with wire sides and no lettering on it was backed up to Geiger\u0027s place. The man in the very new overalls was just heaving a box up on the tailboard. I went back to the boulevard and along the block next to Geiger\u0027s and found a taxi standing at a fireplug. A fresh-faced kid was reading a horror magazine behind the wheel. I leaned in and showed him a dollar: \"Tail job?\" He looked me over. \"Cop?\" \"Private.\" He grinned. \"My meat, Jack.\" He tucked the magazine over his rear view mirror and I got into the cab. We went around the block and pulled up across from Geiger\u0027s alley, beside another fireplug. There were about a dozen boxes on the truck when the man in overalls closed the screened doors and hooked the tailboard up and got in behind the wheel. \"Take him,\" I told my driver. The man in overalls gunned his motor, shot a glance up and down the alley and ran away fast in the other direction. He turned left out of the alley. We did the same. I caught a glimpse of the truck turning east on Franklin and told my driver to close in a little. He didn\u0027t or couldn\u0027t do it. I saw the truck two blocks away when we got to Franklin. We had it in sight to Vine and across Vine and all the way to Western. We saw it twice after Western. There was a lot of traffic and the freshfaced kid tailed from too far back. I was telling him about that without mincing words when the truck, now far ahead, turned north again. The street at which it turned was called Brittany Place. When we got to Brittany Place the truck had vanished. The fresh-faced kid made comforting sounds at me through the panel and we went up the hill at four miles an hour looking for the truck behind bushes. Two blocks up, Brittany Place swung to the east and met Randall Place in a tongue of land on which there was a white apartment house with its front on Randall Place and its basement garage opening on Brittany. We were going past that and the fresh-faced kid was telling me the truck couldn\u0027t be far away when I looked through the arched entrance of the garage and saw it back in the dimness with its rear doors open again. We went around to the front of the apartment house and I got out. There was nobody in the lobby, no switchboard. A wooden desk was pushed back against the wail beside a panel of gilt mailboxes. I looked the names over. A man named Joseph Brody had Apartment 405. A man named Joe Brody had received five thousand dollars from General Sternwood to stop playing with Carmen and find some other little girl to play with. It could be the same Joe Brody. I felt like giving odds on it. I went around an elbow of wall to the foot of tiled stairs and the shaft of the automatic elevator. The top of the elevator was level with the floor. There was a door beside the shaft lettered \"Garage.\" I opened it and went down narrow steps to the basement. The automatic elevator was propped open and the man in new overalls was grunting hard as he stacked heavy boxes in it. I stood beside him and lit a cigarette and watched him. He didn\u0027t like my watching him. After a while I said: \"Watch the weight, bud. She\u0027s only tested for half a ton. Where\u0027s the stuff going?\" \"Brody, four-o-five,\" he grunted. \"Manager?\" \"Yeah. Looks like a nice lot of loot.\" He glared at me with pale white rimmed eyes. \"Books,\" he snarled. \"A hundred pounds a box, easy, and me with a seventy-five pound back.\" \"Well, watch the weight,\" I said. He got into the elevator with six boxes and shut the doors. I went back up the steps to the lobby and out to the street and the cab took me downtown again to my office building. I gave the fresh-faced kid too much moneyand he gave me a dog-eared business card which for once I didn\u0027t drop into the majolica jar of sand beside the elevator bank. I had a room and a half on the seventh floor at the back. The half-room was an office split in two to make reception rooms. Mine had my name on it and nothing else, and that only on the reception room. I always left this unlocked, in case I had a client, and the client cared to sit down and wait. I had a client.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674/49322.html","bookId":1184,"book":{"id":1184,"title":"THE BIG SLEEP 长眠不醒","description":"简介： 一个古怪的父亲，一对儿古怪的姐妹。菲利普马洛第一次登场，面对的就是这样一个家庭。老迈而富有的将军请马洛去寻找他的女婿，他的两个女儿却一直阻止马洛采取进一步行动，花痴一样的妹妹甚至偷偷爬到马洛的床上。诱惑力十足的姐姐则送上双唇。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/15/13-51-33-47-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
