{"id":38535,"no":11,"title":"chapter 11","content":"She wore brownish speckled tweeds, a mannish shirt and tie, handcarved walking shoes. Her stockings were just as sheer as the day before, but she wasn\u0027t showing as much of her legs. Her black hair was glossy under a brown Robin Hood hat that might have cost fifty dollars and looked as if you could have made it with one hand out of a desk blotter. \"Well, you do get up,\" she said, wrinkling her nose at the faded red settee, the two odd semi-easy chairs, the net curtains that needed laundering and the boy\u0027s size library table with the venerable magazines on it to give the place a professional touch. \"I was beginning to think perhaps you worked in bed, like Marcel Proust.\" \"Who\u0027s he?\" I put a cigarette in my mouth and stared at her. She looked a little pale and strained, but she looked like a girl who could function under a strain. \"A French writer, a connoisseur in degenerates. You wouldn\u0027t know him.\" \"Tut, tut,\" I said. \"Come into my boudoir.\" She stood up and said: \"We didn\u0027t get along very well yesterday. Perhaps I was rude.\" \"We were both rude,\" I said. I unlocked the communicating door and held it for her. We went into the rest of my suite, which contained a rust-red carpet, not very young, five green filing cases, three of them full of California climate, an advertising calendar showing the Quints rolling around on a sky-blue floor, in pink dresses, with seal-brown hair and sharp black eyes as large as mammoth prunes. There were three near-walnut chairs, the usual desk with the usual blotter, pen set, ashtray and telephone, and the usual squeaky swivel chair behind it. \"You don\u0027t put on much of a front,\" she said, sitting down at the customer\u0027s side of the desk. I went over to the mail slot and picked up six envelopes, two letters and four pieces of advertising matter. I hung my hat on the telephone and sat down. \"Neither do the Pinkertons,\" I said. \"You can\u0027t make much money at this trade, if you\u0027re honest. If you have a front, you\u0027re making money--or expect to.\" \"Oh--are you honest?\" she asked and opened her bag. She picked a cigarette out of a French enamel case, lit it with a pocket lighter, dropped case and lighter back into the bag and left the bag open. \"Painfully.\" \"How did you get into this slimy kind of business then?\" \"How did you come to marry a bootlegger?\" \"My God, let\u0027s not start quarreling again. I\u0027ve been trying to get you on the phone all morning. Here and at your apartment.\" \"About Owen?\" Her face tightened sharply. Her voice was soft. \"Poor Owen,\" she said. \"So you know about that.\" \"A D.A.\u0027s man took me down to Lido. He thought I might know something about it. But he knew much more than I did. He knew Owen wanted to marry your sister--once.\"She puffed silently at her cigarette and considered me with steady black eyes. \"Perhaps it wouldn\u0027t have been a bad idea,\" she said quietly. \"He was in love with her. We don\u0027t find much of that in our circle.\" \"He had a police record.\" She shrugged. She said negligently: \"He didn\u0027t know the right people. That\u0027s all a police record means in this rotten crime-ridden country.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t go that far.\" She peeled her right glove off and bit her index finger at the first joint, looking at me with steady eyes. \"I didn\u0027t come to see you about Owen. Do you feel yet that you can tell me what my father wanted to see you about?\" \"Not without his permission.\" \"Was it about Carmen?\" \"I can\u0027t even say that.\" I finished filling a pipe and put a match to it. She watched the smoke for a moment. Then her hand went into her open bag and came out with a thick white envelope. She tossed it across the desk. \"You\u0027d better look at it anyway,\" she said. I picked it up. The address was typewritten to Mrs. Vivian Regan, 3765 Alta Brea Crescent, West Hollywood. Delivery had been by messenger service and the office stamp showed 8.35 a.m. as the time out. I opened the envelope and drew out the shiny 4?by 3?photo that was all there was inside. It was Carmen sitting in Geiger\u0027s high-backed teakwood chair on the dais, in her earrings and her birthday suit. Her eyes looked even a little crazier than as I remembered them. The back of the photo was blank. I put it back in the envelope. \"How much do they want?\" I asked. \"Five thousand--for the negative and the rest of the prints. The deal has to be closed tonight, or they give the stuff to some scandal sheet.\" \"The demand came how?\" \"A woman telephoned me, about half an hour after this thing was delivered.\" \"There\u0027s nothing in the scandal sheet angle. Juries convict without leaving the box on that stuff nowadays. What else is there?\" \"Does there have to be something else?\" \"Yes.\" She stared at me, a little puzzled. \"There is. The woman said there was a police jam connected with it and I\u0027d better lay it on the line fast, or I\u0027d be talking to my little sister through a wire screen.\" \"Better,\" I said. \"What kind of jam?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Where is Carmen now?\" \"She\u0027s at home. She was sick last night. She\u0027s still in bed, I think.\" \"Did she go out last night?\" \"No. I was out, but the servants say she wasn\u0027t. I was down at Las Olindas, playing roulette at Eddie Mars\u0027 Cypress Club. I lost my shirt.\" \"So you like roulette. You would.\" She crossed her legs and lit another cigarette. \"Yes. I like roulette. All Sternwoods like losing games, like roulette and marrying men that walk out on them and riding steeplechases at fifty-eight years old and being rolled on by a jumper and crippled for life. The Sternwoods have money. All it has bought them is a rain check.\" \"What was Owen doing last night with your car?\" \"Nobody knows. He took it without permission. We always let him take a car on his night off, but last nightwasn\u0027t his night off.\" She made a wry mouth. \"Do you think--\" \"He knew about this nude photo? How would I be able to say? I don\u0027t rule him out. Can you get five thousand in cash right away?\" \"Not unless I tell Dad--or borrow it. I could probably borrow it from Eddie Mars. He ought to be generous with me, heaven knows.\" \"Better try that. You may need it in a hurry.\" She leaned back and hung an arm over the back of the chair. \"How about telling the police?\" \"It\u0027s a good idea. But you won\u0027t do it.\" \"Won\u0027t I?\" \"No. You have to protect your father and your sister. You don\u0027t know what the police might turn up. It might be something they couldn\u0027t sit on. Though they usually try in blackmail cases.\" \"Can you do anything?\" \"I think I can. But I can\u0027t tell you why or how.\" \"I like you,\" she said suddenly. \"You believe in miracles. Would you have a drink in the office?\" I unlocked my deep drawer and got out my office bottle and two pony glasses. I filled them and we drank. She snapped her bag shut and pushed the chair back. \"I\u0027ll get the five grand,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve been a good customer of Eddie Mars. There\u0027s another reason why he should be nice to me, which you may not know.\" She gave me one of those smiles the lips have forgotten before they reach the eyes. \"Eddie\u0027s blonde wife is the lady Rusty ran away with.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. She stared tightly at me and added: \"That doesn\u0027t interest you?\" \"It ought to make it easier to find him--if I was looking for him. You don\u0027t think he\u0027s in this mess, do you?\" She pushed her empty glass at me. \"Give me another drink. You\u0027re the hardest guy to get anything out of. You don\u0027t even move your ears.\" I filled the little glass. \"You\u0027ve got all you wanted out of me--a pretty good idea I\u0027m not looking for your husband.\" She put the drink down very quickly. It made her gasp--or gave her an opportunity to gasp. She let a breath out slowly. \"Rusty was no crook. If he had been, it wouldn\u0027t have been for nickles. He carried fifteen thousand dollars, in bills. He called it his mad money. He had it when I married him and he had it when he left me. No--Rusty\u0027s not in on any cheap blackmail racket.\" She reached for the envelope and stood up. \"I\u0027ll keep in touch with you,\" I said. \"If you want to leave me a message, the phone girl at my apartment house will take care of it.\" We walked over to the door. Tapping the white envelope against her knuckles, she said: \"You still feel you can\u0027t tell me what Dad--\" \"I\u0027d have to see him first.\" She took the photo out and stood looking at it, just inside the door. \"She has a beautiful little body, hasn\u0027t she?\" \"Uh-huh.\" She leaned a little towards me. \"You ought to see mine,\" she said gravely. \"Can it be arranged?\" She laughed suddenly and sharply and went halfway through the door, then turned her head to say coolly: \"You\u0027re as cold-blooded a beast as I ever met, Marlowe. Or can I call you Phil?\" \"Sure.\" \"You can can me Vivian.\"\"Thanks, Mrs. Regan.\" \"Oh, go to hell, Marlowe.\" She went on out and didn\u0027t look back. I let the door shut and stood with my hand on it, staring at the hand. My face felt a little hot. I went back to the desk and put the whiskey away and rinsed out the two pony glasses and put them away. I took my hat off the phone and called the D.A.\u0027s office and asked for Bernie Ohls. He was back in his cubbyhole. \"Well, I let the old man alone,\" he said. \"The butler said he or one of the girls would tell him. This Owen Taylor lived over the garage and I went through his stuff. Parents at Dubuque, Iowa. I wired the Chief of Police there to find out what they want done. The Sternwood family will pay for it.\" \"Suicide?\" I asked. \"No can tell. He didn\u0027t leave any notes. He had no leave to take the car. Everybody was home last night but Mrs. Regan. She was down at Las Olindas with a playboy named Larry Cobb. I checked on that. I know a lad on one of the tables.\" \"You ought to stop some of that flash gambling,\" I said. \"With the syndicate we got in this county? Be your age, Marlow. That sap mark on the boy\u0027s head bothers me. Sure you can\u0027t help me on this?\" I liked his putting it that way. It let me say no without actually lying. We said good-by and I left the office, bought all three afternoon papers and rode a taxi down to the Hall of Justice to get my car out of the lot. There was nothing in any of the papers about Geiger. I took another look at his blue notebook, but the code was just as stubborn as it had been the night before. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674/49323.html","bookId":1184,"book":{"id":1184,"title":"THE BIG SLEEP 长眠不醒","description":"简介： 一个古怪的父亲，一对儿古怪的姐妹。菲利普马洛第一次登场，面对的就是这样一个家庭。老迈而富有的将军请马洛去寻找他的女婿，他的两个女儿却一直阻止马洛采取进一步行动，花痴一样的妹妹甚至偷偷爬到马洛的床上。诱惑力十足的姐姐则送上双唇。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/15/13-51-33-47-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
