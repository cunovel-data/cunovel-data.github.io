{"id":38536,"no":12,"title":"chapter 12","content":"The trees on the upper side of Laverne Terrace had fresh green leaves after the rain. In the cool afternoon sunlight I could see the steep drop of the hill and the flight of steps down which the killer had run after his three shots in the darkness. Two small houses fronted on the street below. They might or might not have heard the shots. There was no activity in front of Geiger\u0027s house or anywhere along the block. The box hedge looked green and peaceful and the shingles on the roof were still damp. I drove past slowly, gnawing at an idea. I hadn\u0027t looked in the garage the night before. Once Geiger\u0027s body slipped away I hadn\u0027t really wanted to find it. It would force my hand. But dragging him to the garage, to his own car and driving that off into one of the hundred odd lonely canyons around Los Angeles would be a good way to dispose of him for days or even for weeks. That supposed two things: a key to his car and two in the party. It would narrow the sector of search quite a lot, especially as I had had his personal keys in my pocket when it happened. I didn\u0027t get a chance to look at the garage. The doors were shut and padlocked and something moved behind the hedge as I drew level. A woman in a green and white check coat and a small button of a hat on soft blond hair stepped out of the maze and stood looking wild-eyed at my car, as if she hadn\u0027t heard it come up the hill. Then she turned swiftly and dodged back out of sight. It was Carmen Sternwood, of course. I went on up the street and parked and walked back. In the daylight it seemed an exposed and dangerous thing to do. I went in through the hedge. She stood there straight and silent against the locked front door. One hand went slowly up to her teeth and her teeth bit at her funny thumb. There were purple smears under her eyes and her face was gnawed white by nerves. She half smiled at me. She said: \"Hello,\" in a thin, brittle voice. \"Wha--what--?\" That tailed off and she went back to the thumb. \"Remember me?\" I said. \"Doghouse Reilly, the man that grew too tall. Remember?\" She nodded and a quick jerky smile played across her face. \"Let\u0027s go in,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve got a key. Swell, huh?\" \"Wha--wha--?\" I pushed her to one side and put the key in the door and opened it and pushed her in through it. I shut the door again and stood there sniffing. The place was horrible by daylight. The Chinese junk on the walls, the rug, the fussy lamps, the teakwood stuff, the sticky riot of colors, the totem pole, the flagon of ether and laudanum-all this in the daytime had a stealthy nastiness, like a fag party. The girl and I stood looking at each other. She tried to keep a cute little smile on her face but her face was too tired to be bothered. It kept going blank on her. The smile would wash off like water off sand and her pale skin had a harsh granular texture under the stunned and stupid blankness of her eyes. A whitish tongue licked at the corners of her mouth. A pretty, spoiled and not very bright little girl who had gone very, very wrong, and nobody was doing anything about it. To hell with the rich. They made me sick. I rolled a cigarette in my fingers and pushed some books out of the way and sat on the end of the black desk. I lit my cigarette, puffed a plume of smoke and watched the thumb and tooth act for a while in silence. Carmen stood in front of me, like a bad girl in the principal\u0027s office. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked her finally. She picked at the cloth of her coat and didn\u0027t answer. \"How much do you remember of last night?\" She answered that--with a foxy glitter rising at the back of her eyes. \"Remember what? I was sick last night. I was home.\" Her voice was a cautious throaty sound that just reached my ears. \"Like hell you were.\" Her eyes flicked up and down very swiftly. \"Before you went home,\" I said. \"Before I took you home. Here. In that chair--\" I pointed to it--\"on that orange shawl. You remember all right.\" A slow flush crept up her throat. That was something. She could blush. A glint of white showed under the clogged gray irises. She chewed hard on her thumb. \"You--were the one?\" she breathed. \"Me. How much of it stays with you?\" She said vaguely: \"Are you the police?\" \"No. I\u0027m a friend of your father\u0027s.\" \"You\u0027re not the police?\" \"No.\" She let out a thin sigh. \"Wha--what do you want?\" \"Who killed him?\" Her shoulders jerked, but nothing more moved in her face. \"Who else--knows?\" \"About Geiger? I don\u0027t know. Not the police, or they\u0027d be camping here. Maybe Joe Brody.\" It was a stab in the dark but it got a yelp out of her. \"Joe Brody! Him!\" Then we were both silent. I dragged at my cigarette and she ate her thumb. \"Don\u0027t get clever, for God\u0027s sake,\" I urged her. \"This is a spot for a little old-fashioned simplicity. Did Brody kill him?\" \"Kill who?\" \"Oh, Christ,\" I said. She looked hurt. Her chin came down an inch. \"Yes,\" she said solemnly. \"Joe did it.\"\"Why?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" She shook her head, persuading herself that she didn\u0027t know. \"Seen much of him lately?\" Her hands went down and made small white knots. \"Just once or twice. I hate him.\" \"Then you know where he lives.\" \"Yes.\" \"And you don\u0027t like him any more?\" \"I hate him!\" \"Then you\u0027d like him for the spot.\" A little blank again. I was going too fast for her. It was hard not to. \"Are you willing to tell the police it was Joe Brody?\" I probed. Sudden panic flamed all over her face. \"If I can kill the nude-photo angle, of course,\" I added soothingly. She giggled. That gave me a nasty feeling. If she had screeched or wept or even nosedived to the floor in a dead faint, that would have been all right. She just giggled. It was suddenly a lot of fun. She had had her photo taken as Isis and somebody had swiped it and somebody had bumped Geiger off in front of her and she was drunker than a Legion convention, and it was suddenly a lot of nice clean fun. So she giggled. Very cute. The giggles got louder and ran around the corners of the room like rats behind the wainscoting. She started to go hysterical. I slid off the desk and stepped up close to her and gave her a smack on the side of the face. \"Just like last night,\" I said. \"We\u0027re a scream together. Reilly and Sternwood, two stooges in search of a comedian.\" The giggles stopped dead, but she didn\u0027t mind the slap any more than last night. Probably all her boy friends got around to slapping her sooner or later. I could understand how they might. I sat down on the end of the black desk again. \"Your name isn\u0027t Reilly,\" she said seriously. \"It\u0027s Philip Marlowe. You\u0027re a private detective. Viv told me. She showed me your card.\" She smoothed the cheek I had slapped. She smiled at me, as if I was nice to be with. \"Well, you do remember,\" I said. \"And you came back to look for that photo and you couldn\u0027t get into the house. Didn\u0027t you?\" Her chin ducked down and up. She worked the smile. I was having the eye put on me. I was being brought into camp. I was going to yell \"Yippee!\" in a minute and ask her to go to Yuma. \"The photo\u0027s gone,\" I said. \"I looked last night, before I took you home. Probably Brody took it with him. You\u0027re not kidding me about Brody?\" She shook her head earnestly. \"It\u0027s a pushover,\" I said. \"You don\u0027t have to give it another thought. Don\u0027t tell a soul you were here, last night or today. Not even Vivian. Just forget you were here. Leave it to Reilly.\" \"Your name isn\u0027t--\" she began, and then stopped and shook her head vigorously in agreement with what I had said or with what she had just thought of. Her eyes became narrow and almost black and as shallow as enamel on a cafeteria tray. She had had an idea. \"I have to go home now,\" she said, as if we had been having a cup of tea. \"Sure.\" I didn\u0027t move. She gave me another cute glance and went on towards the front door. She had her hand on the knob when we both heard a car coming. She looked at me with questions in her eyes. I shrugged. The car stopped, right in front of the house. Terror twisted her face. There were steps and the bell rang. Carmen stared back at me over her shoulder, her hand clutching the door knob, almost drooling with fear. The bell kept on ringing. Then the ringing stopped. A key tickled at the door and Carmen jumped away from it and stood frozen. The door swung open. A man stepped through it briskly and stopped dead, staring at us quietly, with complete composure.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674/49324.html","bookId":1184,"book":{"id":1184,"title":"THE BIG SLEEP 长眠不醒","description":"简介： 一个古怪的父亲，一对儿古怪的姐妹。菲利普马洛第一次登场，面对的就是这样一个家庭。老迈而富有的将军请马洛去寻找他的女婿，他的两个女儿却一直阻止马洛采取进一步行动，花痴一样的妹妹甚至偷偷爬到马洛的床上。诱惑力十足的姐姐则送上双唇。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/15/13-51-33-47-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
