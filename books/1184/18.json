{"id":38542,"no":18,"title":"chapter 18","content":"Ohls stood looking down at the boy. The boy sat on the couch leaning sideways against the wall. Ohls looked at him silently, his pale eyebrows bristling and stiff and round like the little vegetable brushes the Fuller Brush man gives away. He asked the boy: \"Do you admit shooting Brody?\" The boy said his favorite three words in a muffled voice. Ohls sighed and looked at me. I said: \"He doesn\u0027t have to admit that. I have his gun.\" Ohls said: \"I wish to Christ I had a dollar for every time I\u0027ve had that said to me. What\u0027s funny about it?\"\"It\u0027s not meant to be funny,\" I said. \"Well, that\u0027s something,\" Ohls said. He turned away. \"I\u0027ve called Wilde. We\u0027ll go over and see him and take this punk. He can ride with me and you can follow on behind in case he tries to kick me in the face.\" \"How do you like what\u0027s in the bedroom?\" \"I like it fine,\" Ohls said. \"I\u0027m kind of glad that Taylor kid went off the pier. I\u0027d hate to have to help send him to the deathhouse for rubbing that skunk.\" I went back into the small bedroom and blew out the black candles and let them smoke. When I got back to the living room Ohls had the boy up on his feet. The boy stood glaring at him with sharp black eyes in a face as hard and white as cold mutton fat. \"Let\u0027s go,\" Ohls said and took him by the arm as if he didn\u0027t like touching him. I put the lamps out and followed them out of the house. We got into our cars and I followed Ohls\u0027 twin tail-lights down the long curving hill. I hoped this would be my last trip to Laverne Terrace. Taggart Wilde, the District Attorney, lived at the corner of Fourth and Lafayette Park, in a white frame house the size of a carbarn, with a red sandstone porte-cochere built on to one side and a couple of acres of soft rolling lawn in front. It was one of those solid old-fashioned houses which it used to be the thing to move bodily to new locations as the city grew westward. Wilde came of an old Los Angeles family and had probably been born in the house when it was on West Adams or Figueroa or St. James Park. There were two cars in the driveway already, a big private sedan and a police car with a uniformed chauffeur who leaned smoking against his rear fender and admired the moon. Ohls went over and spoke to him and the chauffeur looked in at the boy in Ohls\u0027 car. We went up to the house and rang the bell. A slick-haired blond man opened the door and led us down the hall and through a huge sunken living room crowded with heavy dark furniture and along another hall on the far side of it. He knocked at a door and stepped inside, then held the door wide and we went into a paneled study with an open French door at the end and a view of dark garden and mysterious trees. A smell of wet earth and flowers came in at the window. There were large dim oils on the walls, easy chairs, books, a smell of good cigar smoke which blended with the smell of wet earth and flowers. Taggart Wilde sat behind a desk, a middle-aged plump man with clear blue eyes that managed to have a friendly expression without really having any expression at all. He had a cup of black coffee in front of him and he held a dappled thin cigar between the neat careful fingers of his left hand. Another man sat at the corner of the desk in a blue leather chair, a cold-eyed hatchet-faced man, as lean as a rake and as hard as the manager of a loan office. His neat well-kept face looked as if it had been shaved within the hour. He wore a well-pressed brown suit and there was a black pearl in his tie. He had the long nervous fingers of a man with a quick brain. He looked ready for a fight. Ohls pulled a chair up and sat down and said: \"Evening, Cronjager. Meet Phil Marlowe, a private eye who\u0027s in a jam.\" Ohls grinned. Cronjager looked at me without nodding. He looked me over as if he was looking at a photograph. Then he nodded his chin about an inch. Wilde said: \"Sit down, Marlowe. I\u0027ll try to handle Captain Cronjager, but you know how it is. This is a big city now.\" I sat down and lit a cigarette. Ohls looked at Cronjager and asked: \"What did you get on the Randall Place killing?\" The hatchet-faced man pulled one of his fingers until the knuckle cracked. He spoke without looking up. \"A stiff, two slugs in him. Two guns that hadn\u0027t been fired. Down on the street we got a blonde trying to start a car that didn\u0027t belong to her. Hers was right next to it, the same model. She acted rattled so the boys brought her in and she spilled. She was in there when this guy Brody got it. Claims she didn\u0027t see the killer.\"\"That all?\" Ohls asked. Cronjager raised his eyebrows a little. \"Only happened about an hour ago. What did you expect--moving pictures of the killing?\" \"Maybe a description of the killer,\" Ohls said. \"A tall guy in a leather jerkin--if you call that a description.\" \"He\u0027s outside in my heap,\" Ohls said. \"Handcuffed. Marlowe put the arm on him for you. Here\u0027s his gun.\" Ohls took the boy\u0027s automatic out of his pocket and laid it on a corner of Wilde\u0027s desk. Cronjager looked at the gun but didn\u0027t reach for it. Wilde chuckled. He was leaning back and puffing his dappled cigar without letting go of it. He bent forward to sip from his coffee cup. He took a silk handkerchief from the breast pocket of the dinner jacket he was wearing and touched his lips with it and tucked it away again. \"There\u0027s a couple more deaths involved,\" Ohls said, pinching the soft flesh at the end of his chin. Cronjager stiffened visibly. His surly eyes became points of steely light. Ohls said: \"You heard about a car being lifted out of the Pacific Ocean off Lido pier this a.m. with a dead guy in it?\" Cronjager said: \"No,\" and kept on looking nasty. \"The dead guy in the car was chauffeur to a rich family,\" Ohls said. \"The family was being blackmailed on account of one of the daughters. Mr. Wilde recommended Marlowe to the family, through me. Marlowe played it kind of close to the vest.\" \"I love private dicks that play murders close to the vest,\" Cronjager snarled. \"You don\u0027t have to be so goddamned coy about it.\" \"Yeah,\" Ohls said. \"I don\u0027t have to be so goddamned coy about it. It\u0027s not so goddamned often I get a chance to be coy with a city copper. I spend most of my time telling them where to put their feet so they won\u0027t break an ankle.\" Cronjager whitened around the corners of his sharp nose. His breath made a soft hissing sound in the quiet room. He said very quietly: \"You haven\u0027t had to tell any of my men where to put their feet, smart guy.\" \"We\u0027ll see about that,\" Ohls said. \"This chauffeur I spoke of that\u0027s drowned off Lido shot a guy last night in your territory. A guy named Geiger who ran a dirty book racket in a store on Hollywood Boulevard. Geiger was living with the punk I got outside in my car. I mean living with him, if you get the idea.\" Cronjager was staring at him levelly now. \"That sounds like it might grow up to be a dirty story,\" he said. \"It\u0027s my experience most police stories are,\" Ohls growled and turned to me, his eyebrows bristling. \"You\u0027re on the air, Marlowe. Give it to him.\" I gave it to him. I left out two things, not knowing just why, at the moment, I left out one of them. I left out Carmen\u0027s visit to Brody\u0027s apartment and Eddie Mars\u0027 visit to Geiger\u0027s in the afternoon. I told the rest of it just as it happened. Cronjager never took his eyes off my face and no expression of any kind crossed his as I talked. At the end of it he was perfectly silent for a long minute. Wilde was silent, sipping his coffee, puffing gently at his dappled cigar. Ohls stared at one of his thumbs. Cronjager leaned slowly back in his chair and crossed one ankle over his knee and rubbed the ankle bone with his thin nervous hand. His lean face wore a harsh frown. He said with deadly politeness: \"So all you did was not report a murder that happened last night and then spend today foxing around so that this kid of Geiger\u0027s could commit a second murder this evening.\" \"That\u0027s all,\" I said. \"I was in a pretty tough spot. I guess I did wrong, but I wanted to protect my client and I hadn\u0027t any reason to think the boy would go gunning for Brody.\"\"That kind of thinking is police business, Marlowe. If Geiger\u0027s death had been reported last night, the books could never have been moved from the store to Brody\u0027s apartment. The kid wouldn\u0027t have been led to Brody and wouldn\u0027t have killed him. Say Brody was living on borrowed time. His kind usually are. But a life is a life.\" \"Right,\" I said. \"Tell that to your coppers next time they shoot down some scared petty larceny crook running away up an alley with a stolen spare.\" Wilde put both his hands down on his desk with a solid smack. \"That\u0027s enough of that,\" he snapped. \"What makes you so sure, Marlowe, that this Taylor boy shot Geiger? Even if the gun that killed Geiger was found on Taylor\u0027s body or in the car, it doesn\u0027t absolutely follow that he was the killer. The gun might have been planted-say by Brody, the actual killer.\" \"It\u0027s physically possible,\" I said, \"but morally impossible. It assumes too much coincidence and too much that\u0027s out of character for Brody and his girl, and out of character for what he was trying to do. I talked to Brody for a long time. He was a crook, but not a killer type. He had two guns, but he wasn\u0027t wearing either of them. He was trying to find a way to cut in on Geiger\u0027s racket, which naturally he knew all about from the girl. He says he was watching Geiger off and on to see if he had any tough backers. I believe him. To suppose he killed Geiger in order to get his books, then scrammed with the nude photo Geiger had just taken of Carmen Sternwood, then planted the gun on Owen Taylor and pushed Taylor into the ocean off Lido, is to suppose a hell of a lot too much. Taylor had the motive, jealous rage, and the opportunity to kill Geiger. He was out in one of the family cars without permission. He killed Geiger right in front of the girl, which Brody would never have done, even if he had been a killer. I can\u0027t see anybody with a purely commercial interest in Geiger doing that. But Taylor would have done it. The nude photo business was just what would have made him do it.\" Wilde chuckled and looked along his eyes at Cronjager. Cronjager cleared his throat with a snort. Wilde asked: \"What\u0027s this business about hiding the body? I don\u0027t see the point of that.\" I said: \"The kid hasn\u0027t told us, but he must have done it. Brody wouldn\u0027t have gone into the house after Geiger was shot. The boy must have got home when I was away taking Carmen to her house. He was afraid of the police, of course, being what he is, and he probably thought it a good idea to have the body hidden until he had removed his effects from the house. He dragged it out of the front door, judging by the marks on the rug, and very likely put it in the garage. Then he packed up whatever belongings he had there and took them away. And later on, sometime in the night and before the body stiffened, he had a revulsion of feeling and thought he hadn\u0027t treated his dead friend very nicely. So he went back and laid him out on the bed. That\u0027s all guessing, of course.\" Wilde nodded. \"Then this morning he goes down to the store as if nothing had happened and keeps his eyes open. And when Brody moved the books out he found out where they were going and assumed that whoever got them had killed Geiger just for that purpose. He may even have known more about Brody and the girl than they suspected. What do you think, Ohls?\" Ohls said: \"We\u0027ll find out--but that doesn\u0027t help Cronjager\u0027s troubles. What\u0027s eating him is all this happened last night and he\u0027s only just been rung in on it.\" Cronjager said sourly: \"I think I can find some way to deal with that angle too.\" He looked at me sharply and immediately looked away again. Wilde waved his cigar and said: \"Let\u0027s see the exhibits, Marlowe.\" I emptied my pockets and put the catch on his desk: the three notes and Geiger\u0027s card to General Sternwood, Carmen\u0027s photos, and the blue notebook with the code list of names and addresses. I had already given Geiger\u0027s keys to Ohls. Wilde looked at what I gave him, puffing gently at his cigar. Ohls lit one of his own toy cigars and blew smoke peacefully at the ceiling. Cronjager leaned on the desk and looked at what I had given Wilde. Wilde tapped the three notes signed by Carmen and said: \"I guess these were just a come-on. If General Sternwood paid them, it would be through fear of something worse. Then Geiger would have tightened thescrews. Do you know what he was afraid of?\" He was looking at me. I shook my head. \"Have you told your story complete in all relevant details?\" \"I left out a couple of personal matters. I intend to keep on leaving them out, Mr. Wilde.\" Cronjager said: \"Hah!\" and snorted with deep feeling. \"Why?\" Wilde asked quietly. \"Because my client is entitled to that protection, short of anything but a Grand Jury. I have a license to operate as a private detective. I suppose that word \u0027private\u0027 has some meaning. The Hollywood Division has two murders on its hands, both solved. They have both killers. They have the motive, the instrument in each case. The blackmail angle has got to be suppressed, as far as the names of the parties are concerned.\" \"Why?\" Wilde asked again. \"That\u0027s okey,\" Cronjager said dryly. \"We\u0027re glad to stooge for a shamus of his standing.\" I said: \"I\u0027ll show you.\" I got up and went back out of the house to my car and got the book from Geiger\u0027s store out of it. The uniformed police driver was standing beside Ohls\u0027 car. The boy was inside it, leaning back sideways in the corner. \"Has he said anything?\" I asked. \"He made a suggestion,\" the copper said and spat. \"I\u0027m letting it ride.\" I went back into the house, put the book on Wilde\u0027s desk and opened up the wrappings. Cronjager was using a telephone on the end of the desk. He hung up and sat down as I came in. Wilde looked through the book, wooden-faced, closed it and pushed it towards Cronjager. Cronjager opened it, looked at a page or two, shut it quickly. A couple of red spots the size of half dollars showed on his cheekbones. I said: \"Look at the stamped dates on the front endpaper.\" Cronjager opened the book again and looked at them. \"Well?\" \"If necessary,\" I said, \"I\u0027ll testify under oath that that book came from Geiger\u0027s store. The blonde, Agnes, will admit what kind of business the store did. It\u0027s obvious to anybody with eyes that that store is just a front for something. But the Hollywood police allowed it to operate, for their own reasons. I dare say the Grand Jury would like to know what those reasons are.\" Wilde grinned. He said: \"Grand Juries do ask those embarrassing questions sometimes--in a rather vain effort to find out just why cities are run as they are run.\" Cronjager stood up suddenly and put his hat on. \"I\u0027m one against three here,\" he snapped. \"I\u0027m a homicide man. If this Geiger was running indecent literature, that\u0027s no skin off my nose. But I\u0027m ready to admit it won\u0027t help my division any to have it washed over in the papers. What do you birds want?\" Wilde looked at Ohls. Ohls said calmly: \"I want to turn a prisoner over to you. Let\u0027s go.\" He stood up. Cronjager looked at him fiercely and stalked out of the room. Ohls went after him. The door closed again. Wilde tapped on his desk and stared at me with his clear blue eyes. \"You ought to understand how any copper would feel about a cover-up like this,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll have to make statements of all of it--at least for the files. I think it may be possible to keep the two killings separate and to keep General Sternwood\u0027s name out of both of them. Do you know why I\u0027m not tearing your ear off?\" \"No. I expected to get both ears torn off.\" \"What are you getting for it all?\" \"Twenty-five dollars a day and expenses.\" \"That would make fifty dollars and a little gasoline so far.\" \"About that.\"He put his head on one side and rubbed the back of his left little finger along the lower edge of his chin. \"And for that amount of money you\u0027re willing to get yourself in Dutch with half the law enforcement of this county?\" \"I don\u0027t like it,\" I said. \"But what the hell am I to do? I\u0027m on a case. I\u0027m selling what I have to sell to make a living. What little guts and intelligence the Lord gave me and a willingness to get pushed around in order to protect a client. It\u0027s against my principles to tell as much as I\u0027ve told tonight, without consulting the General. As for the cover-up, I\u0027ve been in police business myself, as you know. They come a dime a dozen in any big city. Cops get very large and emphatic when an outsider tries to hide anything, but they do the same things themselves every other day, to oblige their friends or anybody with a little pull. And I\u0027m not through. I\u0027m still on the case. I\u0027d do the same thing again, if I had to.\" \"Providing Cronjager doesn\u0027t get your license,\" Wilde grinned. \"You said you held back a couple of personal matters. Of what import?\" \"I\u0027m still on the case,\" I said, and stared straight into his eyes. Wilde smiled at me. He had the frank daring smile of an Irishman. \"Let me tell you something, son. My father was a close friend of old Sternwood. I\u0027ve done all my office permits--and maybe a good deal more--to save the old man from grief. But in the long run it can\u0027t be done. Those girls of his are bound certain to hook up with something that can\u0027t be hushed, especially that little blonde brat. They ought not to be running around loose. I blame the old man for that. I guess he doesn\u0027t realize what the world is today. And there\u0027s another thing I might mention while we\u0027re talking man to man and I don\u0027t have to growl at you. I\u0027ll bet a dollar to a Canadian dime that the General\u0027s afraid his son-in-law, the ex-bootlegger, is mixed up in this somewhere, and what he really hoped you would find out is that he isn\u0027t. What do you think of that?\" \"Regan didn\u0027t sound like a blackmailer, what I heard of him. He had a soft spot where he was and he walked out on it.\" Wilde snorted. \"The softness of that spot neither you nor I could judge. If he was a certain sort of man, it would not have been so very soft. Did the General tell you he was looking for Regan?\" \"He told me he wished he knew where he was and that he was all right. He liked Regan and was hurt the way he bounced off without telling the old man good-by.\" Wilde leaned back and frowned. \"I see,\" he said in a changed voice. His hand moved the stuff on his desk around, laid Geiger\u0027s blue notebook to one side and pushed the other exhibits toward me. \"You may as well take these,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve no further use for them.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674/49330.html","bookId":1184,"book":{"id":1184,"title":"THE BIG SLEEP 长眠不醒","description":"简介： 一个古怪的父亲，一对儿古怪的姐妹。菲利普马洛第一次登场，面对的就是这样一个家庭。老迈而富有的将军请马洛去寻找他的女婿，他的两个女儿却一直阻止马洛采取进一步行动，花痴一样的妹妹甚至偷偷爬到马洛的床上。诱惑力十足的姐姐则送上双唇。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/15/13-51-33-47-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
