{"id":38538,"no":14,"title":"chapter 14","content":"It was ten minutes to five when I parked near the lobby entrance of the apartment house on Randall Place. A few windows were lit and radios were bleating at the dusk. I rode the automatic elevator up to the fourth floor and went along a wide hail carpeted in green and paneled in ivory. A cool breeze blew down the hail from the open screened door to the fire escape. There was a small ivory pushbutton beside the door marked \"405.\" I pushed it and waited what seemed a long time. Then the door opened noiselessly about a foot. There was a steady, furtive air in the way it opened. The man was long-legged, long-waisted, high-shouldered and he had dark brown eyes in a brown expressionless face that had learned to control its expressions long ago. Hair like steel wool grew far back on his head and gave him a great deal of domed brown forehead that might at a careless glance have seemed a dwelling place for brains. His somber eyes probed at me impersonally. His long thin brown fingers held the edge of the door. He said nothing. I said: \"Geiger?\" Nothing in the man\u0027s face changed that I could see. He brought a cigarette from behind the door and tucked it between his lips and drew a little smoke from it. The smoke came towards me in a lazy, contemptuous puff and behind it words in a cool, unhurried voice that had no more inflection than the voice of a faro dealer. \"You said what?\" \"Geiger. Arthur Gwynn Geiger. The guy that has the books.\" The man considered that without any haste. He glanced down at the tip of his cigarette. His other hand, the one that had been holding the door, dropped out of sight. His shoulder had a look as though his hidden hand might be making motions. \"Don\u0027t know anybody by that name,\" he said. \"Does he live around here?\" I smiled. He didn\u0027t like the smile. His eyes got nasty. I said: \"You\u0027re Joe Brody?\" The brown face hardened. \"So what? Got a grift, brother--or just amusing yourself?\" \"So you\u0027re Joe Brody,\" I said. \"And you don\u0027t know anybody named Geiger. That\u0027s very funny.\" \"Yeah? You got a funny sense of humor maybe. Take it away and play on it somewhere else.\" I leaned against the door and gave him a dreamy smile. \"You got the books, Joe. I got the sucker list. We ought to talk things over.\" He didn\u0027t shift his eyes from my face. There was a faint sound in the room behind him, as though a metal curtain ring clicked lightly on a metal rod. He glanced sideways into the room. He opened the door wider. \"Why not--if you think you\u0027ve got something?\" he said coolly. He stood aside from the door. I went past him into the room. It was a cheerful room with good furniture and not too much of it. French windows in the end wall opened on a stone porch and looked across the dusk at the foothills. Near the windows a closed door in the west wall and near the entrance door another door in the same wall. This last had a plush curtain drawn across it on a thin brass rod below the lintel. That left the east wail, in which there were no doors. There was a davenport backed against the middle of it, so I sat down on the davenport. Brody shut the door and walked crab-fashion to a tall oak desk studded with square nails. A cedarwood box with gilt hinges lay on the lowered leaf of the desk. He carried the box to an easy chair midway between the other two doors and sat down. I dropped my hat on the davenport and waited. \"Well, I\u0027m listening,\" Brody said. He opened the cigar box and dropped his cigarette stub into a dish at his side. He put a long thin cigar in his mouth. \"Cigar?\" He tossed one at me through the air. I reached for it. Brody took a gun out of the cigar box and pointed it at my nose. I looked at the gun. It was a black Police .39. I had no argument against it at the moment. \"Neat, huh?\" Brody said. \"Just kind of stand up a minute. Come forward just about two yards. You might grab a little air while you\u0027re doing that.\" His voice was the elaborately casual voice of the tough guy in pictures. Pictures have made them all like that. \"Tsk, tsk,\" I said, not moving at all. \"Such a lot of guns around town and so few brains. You\u0027re the second guy I\u0027ve met within hours who seems to think a gat in the hand means a world by the tail. Put it down and don\u0027t be silly, Joe.\" His eyebrows came together and he pushed his chin at me. His eyes were mean. \"The other guy\u0027s name is Eddie Mars,\" I said. \"Ever hear of him?\" \"No.\" Brody kept the gun pointed at me. \"If he ever gets wise to where you were last night in the rain, he\u0027ll wipe you off the way a check raiser wipes a check.\" \"What would I be to Eddie Mars?\" Brody asked coldly. But he lowered the gun to his knee. \"Not even a memory,\" I said. We stared at each other. I didn\u0027t look at the pointed black slipper that showed under the plush curtain on the doorway to my left. Brody said quietly: \"Don\u0027t get me wrong. I\u0027m not a tough guy--just careful. I don\u0027t know hell\u0027s first whisperabout you. You might be a lifetaker for all I know.\" \"You\u0027re not careful enough,\" I said. \"That play with Geiger\u0027s books was terrible.\" He drew a long slow breath and let it out silently. Then he leaned back and crossed his long legs and held the Colt on his knee. \"Don\u0027t kid yourself I won\u0027t use this heat, if I have to,\" he said. \"What\u0027s your story?\" \"Have your friend with the pointed slippers come on in. She gets tired holding her breath.\" Brody called out without moving his eyes off my stomach. \"Come on in, Agnes.\" The curtain swung aside and the green-eyed, thigh-swinging ash blonde from Geiger\u0027s store joined us in the room. She looked at me with a kind of mangled hatred. Her nostrils were pinched and her eyes had darkened a couple of shades. She looked very unhappy. \"I knew damn well you were trouble,\" she snapped at me. \"I told Joe to watch his step.\" \"It\u0027s not his step, it\u0027s the back of his lap he ought to watch,\" I said. \"I suppose that\u0027s funny,\" the blonde squealed. \"It has been,\" I said. \"But it probably isn\u0027t any more.\" \"Save the gags,\" Brody advised me. \"Joe\u0027s watchin\u0027 his step plenty. Put some light on so I can see to pop this guy, if it works out that way.\" The blonde snicked on a light in a big square standing lamp. She sank down into a chair beside the lamp and sat stiffly, as if her girdle was too tight. I put my cigar in my mouth and bit the end off. Brody\u0027s Colt took a close interest in me while I got matches out and lit the cigar. I tasted the smoke and said: \"The sucker list I spoke of is in code. I haven\u0027t cracked it yet, but there are about five hundred names. You got twelve boxes of books that I know of. You should have at least five hundred books. There\u0027ll be a bunch more out on loan, but say five hundred is the full crop, just to be cautious. If it\u0027s a good active list and you could run it even fifty per cent down the line, that would be one hundred and twenty-five thousand rentals. Your girl friend knows an about that. I\u0027m only guessing. Put the average rental as low as you like, but it won\u0027t be less than a dollar. That merchandise costs money. At a dollar a rental you take one hundred and twenty-five grand and you still have your capital. I mean, you still have Geiger\u0027s capital. That\u0027s enough to spot a guy for.\" The blonde yelped: \"You\u0027re crazy, you goddam eggheaded--!\" Brody put his teeth sideways at her and snarled: \"Pipe down, for Chrissake. Pipe down!\" She subsided into an outraged mixture of slow anguish and bottled fury. Her silvery nails scraped on her knees. \"It\u0027s no racket for bums,\" I told Brody almost affectionately. \"It takes a smooth worker like you, Joe. You\u0027ve got to get confidence and keep it. People who spend their money for second-hand sex jags are as nervous as dowagers who can\u0027t find the rest room. Personally I think the blackmail angles are a big mistake. I\u0027m for shedding all that and sticking to legitimate sales and rentals.\" Brody\u0027s dark brown stare moved up and down my face. His Colt went on hungering for my vital organs. \"You\u0027re a funny guy,\" he said tonelessly. \"Who has this lovely racket?\" \"You have,\" I said. \"Almost.\" The blonde choked and clawed her ear. Brody didn\u0027t say anything. He just looked at me. \"What?\" the blonde yelped. \"You sit there and try to tell us Mr. Geiger ran the kind of business right down on the main drag? You\u0027re nuts!\" I leered at her politely. \"Sure I do. Everybody knows the racket exists. Hollywood\u0027s made to order for it. If a thing like that has to exist, then right out on the street is where all practical coppers want it to exist. For the same reason they favor red light districts. They know where to flush the game when they want to.\" \"My God,\" the blonde wailed. \"You let this cheesehead sit there and insult me, Joe? You with a gun in yourhand and him holding nothing but a cigar and his thumb?\" \"I like it,\" Brody said. \"The guy\u0027s got good ideas. Shut your trap and keep it shut, or I\u0027ll slap it shut for you with this.\" He flicked the gun around in an increasingly negligent manner. The blonde gasped and turned her face to the wall. Brody looked at me and said cunningly: \"How have I got that lovely racket?\" \"You shot Geiger to get it. Last night in the rain. It was dandy shooting weather. The trouble is he wasn\u0027t alone when you whiffed him. Either you didn\u0027t notice that, which seems unlikely, or you got the wind up and lammed. But you had nerve enough to take the plate out of his camera and you had nerve enough to come back later on and hide his corpse, so you could tidy up on the books before the law knew it had a murder to investigate.\" \"Yah,\" Brody said contemptuously. The Colt wobbled on his knee. His brown face was as hard as a piece of carved wood. \"You take chances, mister. It\u0027s kind of goddamned lucky for you I didn\u0027t bop Geiger.\" \"You can step off for it just the same,\" I told him cheerfully. \"You\u0027re made to order for the rap.\" Brody\u0027s voice rustled. \"Think you got me framed for it?\" \"Positive.\" \"How come?\" \"There\u0027s somebody who\u0027ll tell it that way. I told you there was a witness. Don\u0027t go simple on me, Joe.\" He exploded then. \"That goddamned little hot pants!\" he yelled. \"She would, god damn her! She would--just that!\" I leaned back and grinned at him. \"Swell. I thought you had those nude photos of her.\" He didn\u0027t say anything. The blonde didn\u0027t say anything. I let them chew on it. Brody\u0027s face cleared slowly, with a sort of grayish relief. He put his Colt down on the end table beside his chair but kept his right hand close to it. He knocked ash from his cigar on the carpet and stared at me with eyes that were a tight shine between narrowed lids. \"I guess you think I\u0027m dumb,\" Brody said. \"Just average, for a grifter. Get the pictures.\" \"What pictures?\" I shook my head. \"Wrong play, Joe. Innocence gets you nowhere. You were either there last night, or you got the nude photo from somebody that was there. You knew she was there, because you had your girl friend threaten Mrs. Regan with a police rap. The only ways you could know enough to do that would be by seeing what happened or by holding the photo and knowing where and when it was taken. Cough up and be sensible.\" \"I\u0027d have to have a little dough,\" Brody said. He turned his head a little to look at the green-eyed blonde. Not now green-eyed and only superficially a blonde. She was as limp as a fresh-killed rabbit. \"No dough,\" I said. He scowled bitterly. \"How\u0027d you get to me?\" I flicked my wallet out and let him look at my buzzer. \"I was working on Geiger--for a client. I was outside last night, in the rain. I heard the shots. I crashed in. I didn\u0027t see the killer. I saw everything else.\" \"And kept your lip buttoned,\" Brody sneered. I put my wallet away. \"Yes,\" I admitted. \"Up till now. Do I get the photos or not?\" \"About these books,\" Brody said. \"I don\u0027t get that.\" \"I tailed them here from Geiger\u0027s store. I have a witness.\" \"That punk kid?\" \"What punk kid?\" He scowled again. \"The kid that works at the store. He skipped out after the truck left. Agnes don\u0027t evenknow where he flops.\" \"That helps,\" I said, grinning at him. \"That angle worried me a little. Either of you ever been in Geiger\u0027s house--before last night?\" \"Not even last night,\" Brody said sharply. \"So she says I gunned him, eh?\" \"With the photos in hand I might be able to convince her she was wrong. There was a little drinking being done.\" Brody sighed. \"She hates my guts. I bounced her out. I got paid, sure, but I\u0027d of had to do it anyway. She\u0027s too screwy for a simple guy like me.\" He cleared his throat. \"How about a little dough? I\u0027m down to nickels. Agnes and me gotta move on.\" \"Not from my client.\" \"Listen--\" \"Get the pictures, Brody.\" \"Oh, hell,\" he said. \"You win.\" He stood up and slipped the Colt into his side pocket. His left hand went up inside his coat. He was holding it there, his face twisted with disgust, when the door buzzer rang and kept on ringing.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674/49326.html","bookId":1184,"book":{"id":1184,"title":"THE BIG SLEEP 长眠不醒","description":"简介： 一个古怪的父亲，一对儿古怪的姐妹。菲利普马洛第一次登场，面对的就是这样一个家庭。老迈而富有的将军请马洛去寻找他的女婿，他的两个女儿却一直阻止马洛采取进一步行动，花痴一样的妹妹甚至偷偷爬到马洛的床上。诱惑力十足的姐姐则送上双唇。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201611/15/13-51-33-47-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1674","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
