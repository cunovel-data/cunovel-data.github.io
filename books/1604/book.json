There are no regular people anymore.\" Ten years ago when the world ended she ran for her life. Five weeks ago the world she\u0027d hidden from came knocking on the door of her secluded cabin. Ten days ago she found salvation hiding amongst the dead. Yesterday she went back for the living. Today she wonders if she will live to see tomorrow. What do you do when the world you were born to is gone? Where do you hide when even your own body isn\u0027t safe? Emma ran when her daddy told her to. She hid like he said she should. He was the first person she turned her back on. The first one she let die. Ten years has gone by and she still lives by the simple rules he taught her when she was nine years old. \"Don\u0027t help anyone. Don\u0027t go where other people are unless you have to. Trust no one. Always pull the trigger.\" Until one night she hears the worst sound in the world, a knock. A simple, timid knock, on the door to her cabin. Only the voice of the brave little girl, ready to die for her brother, persuades Emma to open the door. As her fingers turn the lock, she has a terrible feeling she will regret her decision. But even as regret fills her world, so do love and companionship. Things she never imagined she would ever have again. Everything comes at a cost, you decide what you\u0027ll pay.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/born-born-1.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":41,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
