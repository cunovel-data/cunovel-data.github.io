The sun is above me and hot. Spring isn’t like it was when I was little. It\u0027s warm and muggy now. I know I\u0027m about halfway. Lost in the trail and thought I hear something I haven’t heard in a long time, a buzz. I follow the noise to a hive. It\u0027s small and only half built but it makes me hopeful. If the bees aren’t dead like I feared they would be, maybe there is hope. I haven’t seen a bee since before.\n I look at the small hive. Humans could do that. We could rebuild. If we stopped trying to be on top, we could stand a chance. I watch the busy bees for a moment and turn back to the trail. It isn’t a real trail. It\u0027s just a direction I walked once before.\n The sun sets, making me tired. I\u0027ve walked nearly twenty-four hours. I climb a huge tree and lay against the trunk, in one of the high up branches. I close my eyes for a minute.\n Flashes fill my head instantly.\n My father is pushing me along the road. Cars and trucks fill the freeway. People sit in them still, but my dad doesn’t think we have enough time to get out. He has waited for this day his whole life.\n \"Em we need to get to high ground and we need to get away from these people.\" His fingers bite into my back, poking it.\n \"Dad maybe we should go back to granny\u0027s.\" My voice is small, compared to the noise from the masses.\n \"No. Run faster Em. We need to run.\" He is in front and dragging me up a grassy hill. My little legs hurt. He\u0027s made me workout and run since I can remember, but it\u0027s late and I\u0027m tired.\n I think a bad thought. It\u0027s a thought I will regret always. His erratic behavior forces the thought.\n His hand squeezes mine.\n I hear a cracking noise. My father\u0027s face fades.\n I wake and look around but I see nothing. My eyes are blocked by something. I lift my head to realize I\u0027m face down in a bushy branch. The smaller branch, I\u0027m resting my weight on, is breaking. I struggle for a moment and pull myself up but the branch below me snaps loudly and falls. It hits every other branch on its way down. I cringe, as each noisy strike fills the air. The rustling of the bushes overtakes the night.\n I pant loudly, waiting.\n My heartbeat is throbbing throughout my body.\n I have nowhere to go if anything has heard my noise. I stay perfectly still, willing my body to calm itself.\n I can\u0027t believe how close I came to falling out of a tree. I never sleep in trees, I always choose underground, but tonight I have no choice. I have no plan. It\u0027s one of my rules to always have a plan. I feel naked without it.\n I stay in the tree, resting my eyes and listening to the sounds of the night.\n I climb down before the sun comes up. I never move much in the day. It\u0027s one of my rules but I have no choice. I\u0027m limited for time.\n I walk quickly, trying not to imagine the fever that has flushed his cheeks or the pain the leg is causing. His eyes unnerve me, even in my own mind.\n I see the trees thinning. I am close. My stomach is a bundle of knots and nerves.\n I walk as close as I can with my weapons. I grip them close to me as I have my last few seconds with them. I\u0027ve only been here once and it scared the shit out of me.\n I tremble and I put them in a hole under a tree. I stuff the bow to the very back of the hole and my knife. I shiver from the nakedness of being without them and I cover the hole with branches.\n I walk away, breaking a branch with my hands every few steps. I leave the snapped ends hanging. It looks like a bear or another large creature has roamed the woods.\n My father\u0027s craziness will live inside of me forever.\n The first few steps from the woods feel like wading through the river. My legs ache, but the anxiety of being on an open road is making them feel like I\u0027m wearing cement boots.\n My breath increases. My peripheral vision becomes sharper. I see a leaf blowing down the concrete. I see an old brown stain and force my brain not to hear the ripping and tearing. It feels weird to walk on a road. It\u0027s been so long I can\u0027t remember the last time.\n Just when my stomach can\u0027t hurt worse, I hear them.\n They\u0027re a ways down the road but they holler at me. I know it\u0027s me they\u0027re shouting at.\n My legs break into a run for the gates of the town, before I dare to glance at them. My muscles push and my bullet hole stings.\n I run in a way I haven’t in a long time. No backpack to weigh me down, just a small sack in my hands. No heavy clothes what with the spring sun popping out. I wearing just a long sleeve t-shirt, cargo pants and my thick-soled boots I took from the dead. I\u0027m faster than I remember being. It could be that I\u0027m more scared than I remember being.\n My arms pump as my legs dig. The ground is passing by me in a blur.\n I see the guards. They won\u0027t protect me unless I reach the town. They\u0027ll watch the men tear my clothes from my body and rape me in the field out front.\n The voices behind me are closing in on me. They\u0027re fast too. They run more than I do.\n \"Don\u0027t run baby. We\u0027ll make it worth your while.\"\n I blast through the guard gate and drop to my knees inside the walls.\n I hear a guard through the blood pounding inside my ears, \"Halt.\"\n I turn around to see four guards suddenly there. They stand in front of the gate with huge guns.\n The five men, who have chased me, are bent over and breathing heavy. I see the smirk of one of the men as his eyes meet mine.\n He points at me, \"See you on the way out. Maybe we can give you an escort home.\"\n Shivers travel my spine. His grin scares me.\n He is seedy and dirty. His smile makes me want to gag. I move away from the contact of a hand gripping my arm suddenly. An older woman helps me stand, \"I won\u0027t bite.\" She looks back at the man and gives him the middle finger. My dad called it the bird. \"Not like them anyway.\"\n She smiles at me. Her teeth are brown. She was probably poor before the world ended. The poor lived longer than any of the rich. They already knew how to survive.\n I hate the smell of the town. I remember that now, as the different smells wash over me. Sewage being the more distinct one.\n \"What can we do for you dear?\"\n I glance at the old lady. I don’t trust her. No one should trust townies. I have to remind myself of the desperate situation I am in.\n \"I need medicine for blood poisoning.\"\n She winces, \"Are you injured?\"\n I shake my head, \"Not for me.\"\n \"What kind of injury?\"\n I pause not wanting to talk to her, but I know I don’t have time to take any chances, \"A stick went into his leg. I sewed it up but I think bark is in there still.\"\n She nods, \"I have just the thing.\" She pulls me along.\n The town is a shantytown, made up of rundown houses and lean-tos. They would have been nice and pretty fancy before. Now the lean-tos almost seem nicer. The walls surrounding the town are made of sharpened poles like out of a medieval village. I see the smelly people peddling their wares to the pass-throughs and I feel like we have entered a dark age. I wish knights in armor were part of this nightmare.\n I am permitted to sleep one night with a purchase. I feel excitement I can\u0027t explain at the idea of sleeping. My rest in the tree was terrible.\n I am a pass-through. I may buy whatever I can carry. Buy is trade and I have very few things I can trade.\n We enter a rundown house with stacks of papers and garbage inside. I can smell the garbage before I enter. The people who sell things raid old towns and landfills. It\u0027s funny that the world before made enough crap to last us even now.\n She clears away a stack of plastic bags and other garbage from a long wooden counter. She lifts a white metal chest up and grins a brown smile at me.\n \"This is very special. It\u0027s from the city. It\u0027s what they use to treat the breeders. My son works there. He lets me have some, to help us here.\"\n Her words both disgust and scare me.\n I can\u0027t help but look around the room. I feel the ambush is upon me any second.\n She laughs, \"Kid don’t be a fool. He was taken there. He doesn’t work there because of the special perks.\" I gag at the way she says perks and raises her eyebrows.\n \"He\u0027s a doctor. All the doctors were taken.\"\n I don’t feel better at the thought. I feel myself panicking at the idea of the breeder farms.\n \"Girl you\u0027re going to have to wow me, for me to give you some of this.\"\n I pull out the big guns on the first try. I would try to bargain but I\u0027m in a hurry to get some sleep. I have to sneak out of the town in the middle of the night. The wolves at the gates have changed my initial plan.\n I pass the small blue bottle to her. Her eyes light up instantly.\n \"Is it still sealed?\"\n I nod. She snatches it and kisses the bottle. I feel my nose scrunch up.\n She eyeballs me with her crazy eyes, \"How did you get this?\"\n \"My father had a health food store. He left me a couple bottles. This is the last one.\" I hate that I\u0027ve given it to her. It\u0027s not really my last one but it\u0027s still priceless.\n She pushes three vials at me from the white chest and points to the door, \"Leave and tell no one what I\u0027ve sold you.\"\n I nod, \"Likewise.\"\n She hands me the slip I need to get a nights sleep at the Inn.\n I leave feeling her eyes on me, but when I look back she is hugging the bottle of pure tea tree oil like a nut. Her messy long white hair makes her look like the evil queen from snow white, hugging the poisoned apple.\n I walk out into the broken concrete street and look around. I see the Inn in the far corner of the shops. I keep my eyes low to the ground as I cross.\n \"Bread miss? Eggs?\"\n I look at a young man pointing to a house. I shake my head. I don\u0027t eat anything that comes from other people. Especially not townies. The sanitation here is far below the standards we had as a civilization. I had heard rumors of a new plague the last time I had come through.\n I enter the Inn and look around. A woman with bright red hair eyes me up and down. I pass her the slip of paper. Her face brightens up. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-8.html","bookId":1604,"book":{"id":1604,"title":"Born (Born #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Born (Born #1) \n \"It\u0027s us and them, Em.
