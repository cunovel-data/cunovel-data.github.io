{"id":92407,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"She pouts, \"Can we make me a bow maybe?\" I nod excitedly. We haven’t had much to talk about. I take the bow and arrow. I pull back and sight in the dying man. His body trembles slightly. His skin has chew marks. The infected will eat anything. \"Hold it steady, sight in what you want to shoot and then take a deep breath.\" I exhale and release the arrow. We are close enough that it makes a slicing sound as it enters his temple. \"Always exhale when you release.\" I grimace as I see the arrow sticking out of his bleeding head. \"Wow.\" I nod, \"Yeah it took a lot of practice.\" \"Sweet fucking god.\" I turn. \"What?\" Jake is standing behind us, \"You guys do realize that\u0027s a person you just shot. These were all people.\" Anna scoffs, \"They\u0027re infected Jake. They\u0027re not like you or me or even the city people.\" I frown, \"City people?\" Jake looks down at the grass. Anna looks at me, \"We saw it. We went close enough to see it.\" \"Electricity? Running water?\" She nods, \"Everything. No cars but a subway and houses and pretty big buildings. It\u0027s on the edge of the desert.\" I feel sickened by asking the question but I ask anyway, \"What about the farms?\" She shivers, \"Up and running still. I think the babies go to the city after they\u0027re born.\" Jake sighs and runs a hand through his hair. He appears to be bothered by the conversation. \"He\u0027s military.\" \"What?\" I look at Anna who is pointing at the dead man with the arrow sticking out of his temple. I look at his boots and shake my head, \"We need to be far away. Now.\" We don’t talk. We leave the arrows sticking out of the faces of the people on the ground. I never take the arrows from the infected. We walk across the small field and into the forest on the other side. I watch Leo the entire walk. It stops me from watching Jake. Leo is the best warning system. Jake is a distraction. Chapter Six The farmhouse sits quiet, just like I hoped it would. I\u0027ve never come back to it so quickly. It serves our purpose the best though. It has the longest, most off the beaten track, driveway of the four and it\u0027s the closest to my cabin. We peel off our soaking wet clothes. My wound burns from the cold river water and the exertion of wading through the river for such a long ways. I have done it before, but it\u0027s not my favorite way to get to the house. I\u0027ve been followed before. I don’t know if we were followed today but I can\u0027t chance it. I can\u0027t help but steal a glance at Jake as he pulls his wet shirt off and drops his jeans on the floor. His wound is bright purple. The brand new scar that\u0027s the developing is lumpy and ugly. \"It\u0027s bigger than I thought it would be.\" I look up at him smiling at me, staring. I pull my pants off and notice for the first time he has drawings of dinner rolls on his boxers. I raise an eyebrow. He laughs, \"Buttered buns.\" \"I don’t get it.\" \"That\u0027s because you were nine when the world went crazy.\" I feel my face blushing, realizing it\u0027s obviously something filthy, \"You were only eleven.\" I say out of spite. He laughs, \"I was but my older brother was sixteen. So that makes me more like fifteen when it happened.\" I stop smiling, but he doesn’t stop talking. \"Will was a bad kid. Our dad used to get so mad at him. He had a magazine collection that could shock a whore.\" I flinch at the word. I know what it means and I know how it works but I\u0027ve never physically heard anyone say it. The conversation feels wrong suddenly. \"One time he was dating this girl Angela and he…\" \"Jake.\" I look back at Anna who is making a distasteful face, \"Dirty Will stories in your underwear is creepy dude.\" I smile. Jake blushes. He looks at me through his bangs and my heart feels like it\u0027s too big for my chest. \"Where is your brother?\" I don’t want to ask but I know I have to. Anna answers from behind me, \"We hope dead.\" I nod. I leave it at that. I know that feeling. Jake\u0027s face is haunted. I swear I see guilt but I leave it. I feel weird being in the house with other people, not just because it\u0027s one of my havens but also because I am never with other people. Ever. My leg aches. I know I won\u0027t sleep. I look at Anna, \"You guys sleep first. Me and Leo will take first watch.\" Jake frowns, \"Why don’t we all just sleep. There is no way anyone followed us Emma.\" I want to slap him, it is irrational, but his survival skills leave a lot to be desired. Instead I turn and walk away, Anna has it. \"Dude we will take watch here every night. It just feels safe here, that doesn’t mean it is.\" \"Fine. Whatever.\" I pull the knife that I stole from the dead military guy out of my boot and rub it down with the bleach I pulled out from under the sink. I wipe the blade down and my fingers. I pour water from my bottle over my fingers and the blade. I hate that I touched something of someone else\u0027s. I catch Jake watching me. I ignore him. I ignore my heart\u0027s desire to flutter every time he glances at me. I will leave him. It\u0027s in my nature. Instead I look at Leo, who has positioned himself in front of the back door and curled into a ball. \"So much for helping, hey boy.\" He opens one yellow eye and closes it again. I take my new knife, my bow and quiver and my bottle of water to the door. I rub Leo\u0027s head once and head out into the night quietly. I stealth across the gravel silently. I open the barn door and slip inside. The darkness of the barn is frightening, but I grip the handle of the blade for strength. I climb the stairs, feeling like something will grab my feet any second and drag me down into the hay. I will finally hear my greatest fear, my own ripping and tearing. I climb into the hayloft and sit in the open window. The dark night is silent. I don’t like silence. I like the sounds of animals telling me I am safe. I open my ears and close my mind against the sounds that haunt me. I hear them suddenly. The night creatures that will warn me of any intruders fill my ears. There is a cricket, a single cricket out in the field. I hear a bat off in the woods south of the farm. Something snorts behind the barn in a way that makes me smile. Whatever it is, it\u0027s rooting. The signs of life fill me with a mistaken and misguided hope. I know the reality of it all. I am not fooled by the warm and fuzzy feelings. I know we are lost, all of humanity is. I know what we have done to each other. We are no longer human. Our humanity is lost. The animals have bested us in behavior and survival. The door to the house slips open. Anna crosses the driveway carefully. A smile crosses my lips, she is a survivor. \"His leg is infected.\" Her whispered words cut me. I know what we must do but I\u0027m not prepared to do it. She sees my face in the dull moonlight, \"I know. I feel the same way.\" \"The medicines are all expired.\" \"We have to go for him. His fever has returned. The red lines have started. My dad warned me about the red lines.\" My eyes leave the deserted yard and fix on hers. They glisten in the moonlight. \"I will go alone.\" The glistening spot in the dark lowered, \"I can\u0027t ask that of you.\" \"He can\u0027t travel.\" \"But I can\u0027t ask that of you. He is my burden.\" I laugh softly into the cool night air, \"He really is isn’t he? How is he so clueless?\" Her lips curl into a grim smile the darkness can\u0027t hide from me, \"He worshipped our brother. They joked and laughed while dad tried to teach us how to survive. Dad always called them the grasshoppers who played all summer.\" The reference makes me flinch, as my granny\u0027s face flashes across my mind. \"When dad died Will took care of us, but he wasn\u0027t a survivor. It wasn’t his fault. Dad let them play.\" I can hear the tears filling her face, \"When Will got taken I was eleven. Jake has tried but he\u0027s, well he\u0027s a moron.\" I look back out into the yard, \"He\u0027s amazing Anna. He\u0027s still full of the things we\u0027ve all lost. He smiles and laughs and sings. I heard him humming the other day and I almost shot him myself and then I realized I haven’t hummed since I was nine years old.\" My skin shivers when I think about spying on him humming. I couldn’t take my eyes off of him. \"He\u0027s a goof. We will travel together Em.\" I look back harshly, \"He will die if we make him travel. Those red lines are blood poisoning and once they reach his heart he\u0027s dead. I will go and you will stay and keep him safe.\" I am risking my life for him. I feel like I am back at the cabin door and she is knocking. I am going to regret this decision. \"I\u0027ll leave tonight. You will have to keep Leo with you. He can help you.\" Her voice is small, \"I can\u0027t ask this of you.\" It\u0027s my turn to smile bitterly, \"Guess you\u0027ll have to trust me.\" I stare out into the night, it\u0027s peaceful and quiet. It scares me more than anything suddenly. I feel my jaw tense, \"If I\u0027m not back in three days you\u0027ll have to cut the leg off and clot it. Don\u0027t give him liquor before you cut it off, it thins the blood and he will bleed out. Clotting is done with a hot iron. You press it against the stump where the leg bleeds to seal the veins.\" I don\u0027t look at her. I can\u0027t. \"The red lines means he has a week at the most. He will need tons of soup and water and rest. He can fight it somewhat with those things.\" I stand, \"I\u0027ll leave tonight.\" My leg aches at the thought of leaving. The barn feels less scary with her in it and I realize my whole life feels that way. Chapter Seven I don\u0027t look back. I know he\u0027s watching me. I can\u0027t bear to see the look on his face. His eyes will haunt me forever. I\u0027ve never left him before. He\u0027s always part of whatever I undertake. He waits in the woods while I raid houses, but he\u0027s there. This is the first time I turn my back on him and I don’t know if I will be back.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-7.html","bookId":1604,"book":{"id":1604,"title":"Born (Born #1)","description":"Storyline: Born (Born #1) \"It\u0027s us and them, Em.
