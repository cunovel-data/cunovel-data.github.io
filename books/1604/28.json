I drop the head and leave the skin and innards in the pile of blood. I know the cougar is waiting for us to leave. I cut a huge hunk of the tough meat along the front quarter off and leave it there too.\\n\\n He throws it over his shoulder. It\u0027s about seventy-five pounds with meat and bone.\\n\\n Will carries it like it weighs nothing.\\n\\n \"You are an amazing shot.\"\\n\\n I nod, \"I know. I practiced for years. I hunt regularly.\"\\n\\n He laughs, \"Good to see you\u0027re humble.\"\\n\\n I look at him offended, \"I am humble.\"\\n\\n He shakes his head. I don’t get the joke.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the plan for the breeder camps?\" He says.\\n\\n I look at him and know he can read my face perfectly.\\n\\n \"I don’t know. We have to do something. They\u0027re killing them off for no reason. Healthy women.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not no reason to them. These women will live long healthy lives and become a burden to society. They will require help and old age assistance. The New World Order is all about breeding to succeed not recreating the entire population. They don’t want the women, just the babies. Grown people are harder to brainwash. They want the new children to see that what they have done was for the greater good.\"\\n\\n I stop \"You don’t believe that do you?\"\\n\\n He frowns, \"Christ no. They have killed billions of people off Emma. They don’t deserve to run the world just because they\u0027re more organized than we are and they were prepared for the fallout. I\u0027m just saying how they think.\"\\n\\n We walk into the camp to see Jake making the girls laugh. I smile and feel like I brighten up. He makes everything feel lighter.\\n\\n He scrunches up his nose, \"What the hell is that?\" The girls giggle at him.\\n\\n \"Venison.\" I say.\\n\\n He looks relieved, \"Oh I actually like venison.\"\\n\\n I roll my eyes at him and Will and I start taking the deer apart. We cut several small steaks and stew meat. Anna starts making a stew in the pot and Jake grills the meat. Sarah cuts up some apples we got from the camp. They seem really small and old but none of us care. She adds them to the stew. Apples and venison sounds weird but when Anna adds water it makes a sweet gravy.\\n\\n Will looks at me and frowns, \"Guess we\u0027re in the same boat as last time. Nowhere to wash up.\"\\n\\n I shrug and hand him some of the cooking water, \"You clean me and I clean you?\"\\n\\n He nods and grabs a small piece of the lavender soap Jake still had from my cabin.\\n\\n We walk to the edge of camp and he pours a small amount on me. I wash up my arms and hands and face. He pours the water on me slowly.\\n\\n When it\u0027s his turns he removes his shirt. I watch him scrubbing his body and feel my stomach knot up the way it does around him. His skin is soft and strong looking. I want to touch it. Instead I pour the cold water on him. He strips to his boxers and I pour more water on him. His tanned skin gets goose pimples. I rinse him off some more and try not to get lost in the water trickling down his skin.\\n\\n We walk back over to the camp. He puts his clothes in a backpack and pulls on the baby blue t-shirt he was wearing when I met him with a pair of jeans. The shirt stretches across his chest.\\n\\n \"Emma.\"\\n\\n I look at Anna smirking at me, \"You want to get the bowls?\"\\n\\n I nod and she giggles. I blush. I know I got lost in him. I know if I\u0027m not careful I will lose myself to him. I can feel how big he is to me. He could swallow me up whole.\\n\\n Chapter Seventeen\\n\\n The old farmhouse sits alone in the field. I close my eyes and let the wind sway the tree and I. I had feared I would never see it again and here I am. Nothing moves in the field, the door to the barn swings with the wind. Everything moves in sync with the wind.\\n\\n I climb down and take my bow.\\n\\n Will and I sneak through the field first. I can hear the others as they enter the field. It\u0027s no doubt Jake and his inability to do anything quietly.\\n\\n We slink up to the farmhouse and wait in the hay.\\n\\n Will gives me a signal for going to look. I shake my head and creep from the field. I have the bow. I kill quieter than he does.\\n\\n My arrow is at the ready. My feet make their first crunch on the gravel, which starts my heartbeat.\\n\\n I don’t do circles. I know Will has my back. It\u0027s a nice feeling. I lower the bow and put the arrow back. I unsheathe my hunting knife.\\n\\n Sweat lingers on my face. Summer has started. It comes earlier every year.\\n\\n I look in the barn first. I hear footsteps but I know they\u0027re Will\u0027s. He is walking behind me, watching my six. Anna is next out of the forest. Hopefully she has left Jake and Sarah in the field.\\n\\n The barn is empty. I lift the bunker cover on the floor and am excited when I see my stuff sitting there.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll clear the house.\"\\n\\n I look at Anna as she walks behind him into the barn, \"Don’t forget the basement cellar.\" She nods. I pick up my hunting rifle with scope and toss it at her. She beams when she sees it.\\n\\n Will frowns, \"That’s a lot of fire power for her.\" He\u0027s too serious.\\n\\n I raise an eyebrow, \"She saved my life with it. She\u0027s probably a better shot than you with it.\"\\n\\n He snorts. She pushes his arm but it looks forced. I can see she isn’t as playful or friendly with him yet. She sees the differences in him. At least she is pushing and teasing him now.\\n\\n I pull the boots off and rub the bottoms of my feet. I pull on some socks I have stored and the boots I always stock piled here. My feet sigh with relief as I tie the laces. I instantly feel better.\\n\\n I grab a few sealed bags of jerky and some water bottles.\\n\\n Jake and Sarah are standing in the wheat field. I can see his face.\\n\\n I wave at him to come.\\n\\n I am happy. I wish we could live here. I can see us running this farm.\\n\\n I don’t hear it until it\u0027s too late. Sarah and Jake are walking across the gravel chatting like blue jays.\\n\\n A shot echoes through the clear sky.\\n\\n I see a dust spot rising from the ground in front of Jake and Sarah.\\n\\n I hear a scream, \"RUN!\" My arms are waving. The jerky drops from my hands and the water bottles roll along the gravel. I have an arrow out and pulled and am running to where they are ducking.\\n\\n Jake picks her up and sprints in his hobbled way to the side of the house. I see the flash from the scope and let loose the arrow. I have another pulled and am searching the windy field.\\n\\n I don’t see anything but a shot rings out again and a dust spot appears to my right. I run into the field. I duck and run with the arrow drawn. A dark shape appears through the wheat and leaps me from the right side. I am surrounded.\\n\\n My bow drops but I have my hunting knife out again. I am stabbing but the person taking me to the ground moves faster than I do. His hands grip my wrists. I see his smile as he takes me to the ground.\\n\\n He pins my wrists to the ground and I cry out, \"Why?\"\\n\\n He laughs, \"I knew you would have places like this. I knew he would set you up.\"\\n\\n Serge has me pinned. His weight is holding my body to the ground. I try kicking him, but he is too wide between my legs for me to get a good kick in.\\n\\n \"You sure have gotten pretty Emma Ray.\"\\n\\n I cringe, \"Fuck you.\"\\n\\n He presses himself into me, \"I think that can be arranged.\" He whistles. I hear the hay whisper where the other people are in the field. It sounds like the wheat rustles in about seven locations.\\n\\n \"I never imagined you would be a rebel though. When we saw you heading there, I was pretty surprised. Your daddy would be proud of the woman you\u0027ve become.\" His eyes leer. He licks his chapped lips. I gag.\\n\\n I expect several outcomes. Will will fight and probably kill three, Anna will get at least two and Jake will die. The rest will take us captive and Will will die trying to stop them.\\n\\n What I don’t expect happens as Serge lowers his face to mine. His hot breath is an inch from my face, when a dark shape rolls him from me. I see fur and fangs. He cries out but the huge jaw tears open his throat.\\n\\n I reach for the fur. Leo growls at me. He is scolding me. I know this. I bow my head to him. He snorts and shakes his head. Blood coats his muzzle.\\n\\n I hear a gunshot and know the fight has started.\\n\\n I lift the bow from the ground and pull an arrow fast. My hand trembles. I steady my arm and release the arrow hitting a man with red hair in the throat. It\u0027s the man who\u0027s nose I broke.\\n\\n I pull another arrow. Tears start to drip down my cheeks. I hit a dark haired man who is holding Sarah around the throat and pointing a gun at Jake. My arrow slices through his temple.\\n\\n Anna has shot two men and Will is ground fighting with what I think is the last of them. I don’t see movements. I hear the sobs in my chest but I can\u0027t stop them. It\u0027s like my body needs the release and whether I like it or not I am going to cry. I look down at Leo and drop to my knees. He doesn’t leap at me like normal. He can sense the differences. He comes slowly. He nudges me and covers me with his warmth. I cry into him. His thick dark fur sticks to my tears and spit. He senses the shift in me. I know he does.\\n\\n I sense it in him too. I\u0027ve left him for too long and he\u0027s come looking for me. He\u0027s thinner than I remember him being. How long has he waited in the fields for me to come to him? A moment passes that contains all of the things that could have happened. I don’t fight the bad thoughts. I let them pass through me and leave from the other side.\\n\\n \"Jake, it\u0027s Leo.\" Anna is running to me.\\n\\n Her footsteps on the gravel scare me. Not because someone is running to me but because she is making noise in a place that’s always been quiet. The quiet is gone. I fear for the old farmhouse.\\n\\n \"Goddamn Emma. That was disgusting. His brains came out the other side. Sarah is throwing up.\" Jake says making a gagging sound.\\n\\n I chuckle. It\u0027s soft and probably not a real laugh but I need something. My father\u0027s friend was going to tear my clothes and tear me the way he probably has a hundred other girls. The world is upside down now. Nothing has goodness in it except the people we are with. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-28.html","bookId":1604,"book":{"id":1604,"title":"Born (Born #1)","description":"Storyline: Born (Born #1) \\n \"It\u0027s us and them, Em.
