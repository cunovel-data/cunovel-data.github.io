{"id":35076,"no":54,"title":"Chapter 54","content":"Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned, and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is broad and solitary, where the waterside inhabitants are very few, and where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we could choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by, all night. The steamer for Hamburg, and the steamer for Rotterdam, would start from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at what time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail the first; so that if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we should have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel. The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose, was so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the movement on the river, and the moving river itself - the road that ran with us, seeming to sympathize with us, animate us, and encourage us on - freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends, and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day. At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present extent, and watermen\u0027s boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing colliers, and coasting traders, there were perhaps as many as now; but, of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide; the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries, briskly. Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate market with its oyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor\u0027s Gate, and we were in among the tiers of shipping. Here, were the Leith, Aberdeen, and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were colliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off stages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up, which were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at her moorings was to-morrow\u0027s steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took good notice; and here to-morrow\u0027s for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we crossed. And now I, sitting in the stern, could see with a faster beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs. `Is he there?\u0027 said Herbert. `Not yet.\u0027 `Right! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his signal?\u0027 `Not well from here; but I think I see it. - Now, I see him! Pull both. Easy, Herbert. Oars!\u0027 We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board and we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas bag, and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished. `Dear boy!\u0027 he said, putting his arm on my shoulder as he took his seat. `Faithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!\u0027 Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty chain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood and shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the figure-head of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds (as is done by many Johns), and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality of bosom and her nobby eyes starting two inches out of her head, in and out, hammers going in shipbuilders\u0027yards, saws going at timber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky ships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible sea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen, in and out - out at last upon the clearer river, where the ships\u0027 boys might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled waters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind. At the Stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had looked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We certainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not, either attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by any boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on, or to make her purpose evident. But, we held our own, without any appearance of molestation. He had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural part of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he had led, accounted for it), that he was the least anxious of any of us. He was no indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no notion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted it, but it must come before he troubled himself. `If you knowed, dear boy,\u0027 he said to me, `what it is to sit here alonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day betwixt four walls, you\u0027d envy me. But you don\u0027t know what it is.\u0027 `I think I know the delights of freedom,\u0027 I answered. `Ah,\u0027 said he, shaking his head gravely. `But you don\u0027t know it equal to me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it equal to me - but I ain\u0027t a going to be low.\u0027 It occurred to me as inconsistent, that for any mastering idea, he should have endangered his freedom and even his life. But I reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I was not far out, since he said, after smoking a little: `You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t\u0027other side the world, I was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for all I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody\u0027s head would be troubled about him. They ain\u0027t so easy concerning me here, dear boy - wouldn\u0027t be, leastwise, if they knowed where I was.\u0027 `If all goes well,\u0027 said I, `you will be perfectly free and safe again, within a few hours.\u0027 `Well,\u0027 he returned, drawing a long breath, `I hope so.\u0027 `And think so?\u0027 He dipped his hand in the water over the boat\u0027s gunwale, and said, smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me: `Ay, I s\u0027pose I think so, dear boy. We\u0027d be puzzled to be more quiet and easy-going than we are at present. But - it\u0027s a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water, p\u0027raps, as makes me think it - I was a thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours, than we can see to the bottom of this river what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can\u0027t no more hold their tide than I can hold this. And it\u0027s run through my fingers and gone, you see!\u0027 holding up his dripping hand. `But for your face, I should think you were a little despondent,\u0027 said I. `Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of that there rippling at the boat\u0027s head making a sort of a Sunday tune. Maybe I\u0027m a growing a trifle old besides.\u0027 He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of England. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror, for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he would be safest where he was, and he said. `Do you, dear boy?\u0027 and quietly sat down again. The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of the nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the muddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend. As our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a boat or two\u0027s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch the stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And soon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing, and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool, began to crowd upon us in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and mudbanks. Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour\u0027s rest proved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about. It was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed stranded and still. For, now, the last of the fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed; and the last green barge, straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and some ballast-lighters, shaped like a child\u0027s first rude imitation of a boat, lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles, stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stage an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us was stagnation and mud. We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder work now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed, and rowed, and rowed, until the sun went down. By that time the river has lifted us a little, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life, save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull. As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full, would not rise early, we held a little council: a short one, for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home. The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and what light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as the oars in their dipping struck as a few reflected stars. At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or other of us was sure to start and look in that direction. Here and there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them nervously. Sometimes, `What was that ripple?\u0027 one of us would say in a low voice. Or another, `Is that a boat yonder?\u0027 And afterwards, we would fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels. At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard by. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light to be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various liquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms - `such as they were,\u0027 the landlord said. No other company was in the house than the landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the `Jack\u0027 of the little causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low-water mark too. With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder, and boat-hook, and all else, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop were to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have thought the family possessed. But, we considered ourselves well off, notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found. While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the Jack - who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes on, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashore - asked me if we had seen a four-oared galley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must have gone down then, and yet she `took up too,\u0027 when she left there. `They must ha\u0027 thought better on\u0027t for some reason or another,\u0027 said the Jack, `and gone down.\u0027 `A four-oared galley, did you say?\u0027 said I. `A four,\u0027 said the Jack, `and two sitters.\u0027 `Did they come ashore here?\u0027 `They put in with a stone two-gallon jar, for some beer. I\u0027d ha\u0027been glad to pison the beer myself,\u0027 said the Jack, `or put some rattling physic in it.\u0027 `Why?\u0027 `I know why,\u0027 said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud had washed into his throat. `He thinks,\u0027 said the landlord: a weakly meditative man with a pale eye, who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack: `he thinks they was, what they wasn\u0027t.\u0027 `I knows what I thinks,\u0027 observed the Jack. `You thinks Custum \u0027Us, Jack?\u0027 said the landlord. `I do,\u0027 said the Jack. `Then you\u0027re wrong, Jack.\u0027 `AMI!\u0027 In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in his views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into it, knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on again. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he could afford to do anything. `Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then, Jack?\u0027 asked the landlord, vacillating weakly. `Done with their buttons?\u0027 returned the Jack. `Chucked \u0027em overboard. Swallered \u0027em. Sowed \u0027em, to come up small salad. Done with their buttons!\u0027 `Don\u0027t be cheeky, Jack,\u0027 remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and pathetic way. `A Custum \u0027Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,\u0027 said the Jack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, `when they comes betwixt him and his own light. A Four and two sitters don\u0027t go hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and both with and against another, without there being Custum \u0027Us at the bottom of it.\u0027 Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord, having no one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the subject. This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice, was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced Provis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Starlop by this time knew the state of the case), and held another council. Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer\u0027s time, which would be about one in the afternoon; or whether we should put off early in the morning; was the question we discussed. On the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the steamer\u0027s time, and then to get out in her track, and drift easily with the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went to bed. I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a few hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house (the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled me. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the window. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and, as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw two men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at nothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction of the Nore. My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going away. But, reflecting before I got into his room, which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder day than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I could see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I soon lost them, and feeling very cold, lay down to think of the matter, and fell asleep again. We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the men belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so - as, indeed, it might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take us aborad there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about noon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern. He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger, not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As we approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place, while I went on to reconnoitre; for, it was towards it that the men had passed in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no boat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were there any signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure the tide was high, and there might have been some footpints under water. When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I waved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited; sometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves: until we saw our boat coming round. We got aborad easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that time it wanted but ten minutes of one o\u0027clock, and we began to look out for her smoke. But, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands cordially, and neither Herbert\u0027s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us, and row out into the same track. A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer\u0027s smoke, by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible, coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to sit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, `Trust to me, dear boy,\u0027 and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was very skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and fallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars, she kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder lines, and looked at us attentively - as did all the rowers; the other sitter was wrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in either boat. Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first, and gave me the word `Hamburg,\u0027 in a low voice as we sat face to face. She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew louder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us, when the galley hailed us. I answered. `You have a returned Transport there,\u0027 said the man who held the lines. `That\u0027s the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch, otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender, and you to assist.\u0027 At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew, he ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on to our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner\u0027s shoulder, and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide, and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically. Still in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up, lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that the face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago. Still in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board the steamer and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink from under me. It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was taken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there; but our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone. What with the cries abroad the steamer, and the furious blowing off of her steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but, the crew of the galley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it, bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up his hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming, but not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles. The galley was kept steady, and the silent eager look-out at the water was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not understanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out was kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone; but, everybody knew that it was hopeless now. At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise. Here, I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch - Provis no longer - who had received some very severe injury in the chest and a deep cut in the head. He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to his chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought he had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson, but, that in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had both gone overboard together; when the sudden wrenching of him (Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him in it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down, fiercely locked in each other\u0027s arms, and that there had been a struggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out, and swum away. I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard. When I asked this officer\u0027s permission to change the prisoner\u0027s wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the public-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take charge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocketbook which had once been in my hands, passed into the officer\u0027s. He further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but, declined to accord that grace to my two friends. The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay. We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and Startop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a doleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch\u0027s side, I felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived. For now, my repugnance to him had all melted away, and in the hunted wounded shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately, gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a series of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to Joe. His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on, and often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm I could use, in any easy position; but, it was dreadful to think that I could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was unquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living, people enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not doubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had been presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken prison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation under a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who was the cause of his arrest. As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us, and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake. `Dear boy,\u0027 he answered, `I\u0027m quite content to take my chance. I\u0027ve seen my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.\u0027 No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No. Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick\u0027s hint now. I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to the Crown. `Lookee here, dear boy,\u0027 said he `It\u0027s best as a gentleman should not be knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for the last o\u0027 many times, and I don\u0027t ask no more.\u0027 `I will never stir from your side,\u0027 said I, `when I am suffered to be near you. Please God, I will be as true to you, as you have been to me!\u0027 I felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away as he lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his throat - softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing that he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might not otherwise have thought of until too late: That he need never know how his hopes of enriching me had perished. 这是三月份的一天，太阳当空照着十分温暖，风吹起时却又寒气袭人：在阳光下已经是夏季，而在背阴之处还是冬天。我们穿上厚呢大衣，我还带上一个包，包里装的是我日常需要的几件东西，其他的东西一件也未带。我究竟此去何方，去干何事，何日归来，这一连串的问题对我说来全然无知；我根本不会想这些问题，或者用它们来苦恼自己，我心中的念头只有一个，就是普鲁威斯的安全。从住宅出来，心中不免有些怅惘，于是站在门口回首观望，即使来日我还能看到这些屋子，恐怕也全都会变样。我们在去往寺区石埠的路上悠闲地踱着，逛着，有时悠闲地站上一会儿，装出若无其事，根本没有准备下水的神态。当然，我事先做了细心的安排，船只已准备妥当，万事皆备，只等上船。当时那里除了两三个寺区一带的水手外，谁都没有看见我们，于是我们略微犹豫一番，便跳上船，解索离去。赫伯特划桨，我掌舵。这时正是八点半钟，是即将满潮达到高水位的时刻。 我们的计划是，等九点潮水满盈后开始退潮时，我们的小船便顺水而下，直到当日下午三时后潮水改向，我们的小船继续缓缓逆流而上，可以一直划到天黑。那时我们早已划过肯特和艾塞克斯之间的格里夫森好长一段路程了。那里河面宽阔，人来人往稀少，是一个幽静所在，河边居民只有三两家，单门独户的小酒店、船行随处可见。我们可以停泊上岸挑选一家吃饭休息，并可以在那里过夜。无论是开往汉堡的轮船或是开往鹿特丹的轮船都会在星期四上午九时从伦敦驶出。我们根据我们小船停泊的地点推算出它们来到的时间。哪一条船先到便先招呼哪一条船，万一由于种种原因上不了第一条船，我们尚有第二次机会。好在我们对每一条船的特征记号全都熟记无误。 终于我们开始执行计划了，心情从沉闷中舒展开来，我不禁感到这是多么有意义的事情，而且几小时之前的怅们情绪再也不见了。空气清新爽快，阳光温暖，小船在水上轻驶而过，河水在阳光下泛着涟漪，整条水路似乎对我们充满了同情，使我们内心充满生机，鼓励我们一往直前，使我们充满新的希望。而我自己却感到有些屈辱，在这次行程中我的用处不大，然而我的这两位朋友却是难得的优秀桨手，他们即使终日划桨击水，也自会从容不迫，没有倦意。 在那个时代，泰晤士河的水上交通远远比不上今天，不过船夫们划的小船和今天倒也不相上下。至于驳船、运煤帆船、沿海航班这类船只不比今天的少，但是要说大大小小的蒸汽船，还不到今天的十分之一或二十分之一。这天，虽然天时尚早，已经有许多短桨舢板在水上川流不息，另外还有许多驳船也顺流而下。在那些年头驾一条敞篷小舟行驶于泰晤士河的桥与桥之间，比起这些年来更加容易，也更加普遍。所以，我们轻快地驾舟行驶于各种轻舟渡船之间。 很快就经过了老伦敦桥，接着是毕林斯门鱼市场，这里都是牡蛎船和荷兰人的船，然后就是白塔楼和叛徒门，我们穿行于密密麻麻的船只之间。这里有各式各样的蒸汽船，有开往利思的，开往阿伯丁的，也有开往格拉斯哥的，有装货的，也有卸货的。我们划过这些船只时，看到它们一艘艘犹似巨人高耸在水面之上。接着又出现了许多装煤船，每当煤从舱里吊起来时，装卸工人都奔向甲板以保持船的平衡，然后煤块便哗啦啦地倒进了驳船。接着我们看到了停泊在这里的明天驶往鹿特丹的蒸汽轮船，对它看了又看；然后又是一艘明天开往汉堡的蒸汽轮船，我们正从它下面的牙樯旁驶过。这时我正坐在船尾，磨坊河滨及磨坊河滨的石码头已在眼前，而我的心也怦怦地乱跳起来。 “他在那里吗？”赫伯特问道。 “还没有呢。” “太棒了！他不看到我们是不会来到河畔的。你看到他的信号了吗？” “这里看不清楚；不过，我看到了。现在我看到他了！你们两人快划。赫伯特，放松一些。停下！” 小船轻轻地一靠石码头，一眨眼功夫，他便跳到了船上，我们划船继续向前。他身上穿着水手斗篷，手上拎了一只黑色帆布包，看上去像是一名水上领航人，这正是我所希望的样子，因而心头很满意。 “亲爱的孩子！”他一坐好，便伸手拍拍我的肩头说道，“诚实的好孩子，你做得很好，谢谢你，谢谢你！” 我们的小船又穿行于密密麻麻的船只之间，避开生了锈的铁锚链，磨损的粗麻绳，以及上下起伏的浮标。我们划到哪里，哪里的破篮子破篓子便随着一时沉入水底，浮在水面的木片儿刨花儿也都被冲得四散逃奔，漂在水上的煤渣煤屑也分成两行。我们的小舟穿行于河上，在这里我们经过一艘船，船头是桑德兰的约翰的头像，正张大嘴巴对着风演说，和其他的许多约翰一样；在那里我们又经过一艘船，船头是雅茅斯的佩茜的头像，胸脯轮廓结实，圆眼珠从眼窝子里突出两英寸。我们的小舟穿行于河上，船厂中传来铁锤的敲打声，锯子的锯木声，不知正在干什么名堂的机器声，漏船中的抽水声，绞盘的起锚声，船只的出海声，还有海上营生的人们和轻舟的水手们隔船的对骂声，但骂的是什么，却难以理解。我们的小舟穿行于河上，直至河水忽然清澈一片。船夫们纷纷取下护船板，再不需要它们来混水摸鱼，这里各种花色的彩帆在风中都各显能力。 自我们在石码头接他上船之后，我一直保持警惕，注意着我们是否受到怀疑。我发现我们没有受到怀疑，任何受怀疑的迹象都没有。无论是刚才还是现在，我们肯定这条小船既没有被别的船跟踪，也没有被监视。如果我发现有船跟着我们，我们就会向岸边靠去，逼着它驶到前面去，如果它不向前驶去，它的目的便暴露无遗。不过，我们的小舟总是一往直前，没有发生任何干扰。 他身上穿着水手斗篷，我刚才就说过，这个样子和这个环境很相称。在我们这几个人当中他是最无忧无虑的，这可谓是怪事，也许因为他已经过惯了这种倒霉与不幸的生活。当然这并不表明他对自己漠不关心、麻木不仁，因为他告诉过我，他希望活着看到他培养起来的上流社会的人，在外国也算是出类拔萃的绅士。在我看来，他天生不是个被动的人，也不是听天由命的人；但是他不会注意到中途遇到的危险。他的性格是危险来了，就面对危险；既然危险没有到，也没有必要先苦恼自己。 “亲爱的孩子，”他对我说道，“今天我可以坐在我亲爱的孩子身边抽烟了。这之前，我只能一天接一天地坐在四面墙之间，你要是能懂得我此时此刻的心情，你一定会羡慕我。可是你不会懂的。” “我想我懂得自由的乐趣。”我答道。 “噢，”他严肃地摇着头说道，“不过，即使你懂，你也不会像我懂得那么深刻。你没有被关过，没有被锁过，亲爱的孩子，你怎么能懂得与我一般深呢。不过，我今后再不想走下贱的路了。” 听了他的话我忽然想到，他不至于再违背自己所说的话，危及自己的自由，甚至对自己的生命造成危险。但是我又想到，也许他的自由是指具有危险性的自由吧，这才符合他个人的存在习惯，这和其他人们的理解不同。我的这一想法不是异想天开，因为他抽了一会儿烟后说道： “你明白吗，亲爱的孩子，我生活在那里时，也就是生活在异国时，我的眼睛总是盯着这边望；我在那里发财成了富翁，却又感到日子很平庸。在那里，谁都认识马格韦契，马格韦契来，马格韦契去，谁也不管，谁也不来找麻烦。而这里的人对我就不会那么放心了，亲爱的孩子，至少可以这么说，他们只要知道我在这里，他们就不会那么放心了。” “如果一切平安无事，”我说道，“只消几个小时，你就又会得到完全的自由和完全的平安。” “唔，”他吸了一口长气，答道，“但愿如此。” “难道你不这样想吗？” 他把手伸到船外，伸进水中，然后微笑着，脸上出现了温和的神采，像过去一样，温和地说道： “唉，我想你说得也对，亲爱的孩子。但现在我们是如此的平安无事，如此的自由自在，而更加的平安无事和更加的自由自在会令我们困惑。小船在河上荡着多么令人舒适，多么令人愉快，也许正是这种情况才使我这样想吧。刚才我一面抽烟一面思索，几个小时之后究竟会怎么样，谁知道呢？你看，我用手可以把水捧起来，可是捧起水也看不到河底的情况。你看我捧起水，水也会从我手指间流去，同样我们也无法把握住时间。”说着他举起浸在水中的手。 “要不是看到你面孔上的表情，我还以为你失去信心了。”我说道。 “我一点也没有失去信心，亲爱的孩子！看小船平静地在河上行驶，浪花冲撞着船头发出的声音真好像和拜天唱的圣歌。此外，说不定我年纪也大了些了。” 他把烟斗放回到自己嘴里，面部表情十分安详。他坐在那里一副从容平和、心情满足的姿态，仿佛我们已出了英国一样。他对我们提出的每一句劝告都很顺从，好像他的内心一直惶恐不安，提心吊胆。比如我们跑上岸去买几瓶啤酒收在船上备用时，他也跨步出船想和我们一起去，我便向他暗示他还是留在船上安全，他便对我说：“亲爱的孩子，是这样吗？”于是又安静地坐了下来。 河上的空气尚有寒意，而天气却十分明朗，阳光和煦，令人愉快。潮水势头很猛，我们抓紧时机驾舟而下，双桨击水又稳又快地行驶于河上。接着潮水的势头减弱，在不知不觉中岸边的树林和小山越来越少，而淤泥越来越多，水位也逐渐低了下去。当小船驶出格里夫森时，我们仍然在顺水而下。因为我们所保护的人裹着一件斗篷，我们也便故意把船驶向那艘海关的船，和它仅隔一两条船，这样便易于抓住顺水的机会赶路。我们沿着两条移民船船身而过，驶到一艘大型运输船的船头下面，轮船的前甲板上站着军队，他们都向下看着我们。没有一会儿，潮水的势头就下去了，停泊在那儿的船只摇晃起来，接着便都掉转船头，乘水流的回潮之势开始驶往蒲耳地区，于是成群的船只像舰队一样迎头而来，我们不得不驶往岸边，傍岸而行。一方面我们要避开潮水对我们的冲击，另一方面还要十分仔细地不至于在浅水的地方和淤泥的岸边搁浅。 我们的两位桨手现在是兴致勃勃，因为一路之上都是顺水而下，他们不时地可以休息一两分钟。此时他们只要休息一刻钟就感到足够了。我们下船上岸，坐在滑溜溜的石头上。我们随身带了所准备的食品和酒，又吃又喝，并且观赏四周河山。这里多像我家乡的那一片沼泽地啊，地势平坦，景色单调，远远的地平线幽暗朦胧，河流蜿蜒弯曲，迂回而流，河上漂摇的浮标也蜿蜒弯曲，迂回而动，此外，其余的一切都好像静止的一样搁浅在那里。此时，那最后的一队船只也已经转进了我们刚才来时的那处转角，消失了；紧紧跟在后面的那条绿色的船只，满装着干草，抖动着棕色的帆，也在转角处消失。有几条装砂石的小船陷在淤泥之中，这些船的形状就像小孩子们所做的粗笨船模一样。有一座很小的沙滩灯塔，在那敞开的石堆上，就像一个脚踩高跷、手扶拐杖的瘤子一样，满身泥泞的标桩插在淤泥之中，满身泥泞的怪石陷在淤泥之中，红色的路标和红色的潮标也站在淤泥之中，一座破旧的浮码头和一所破得连屋顶也没有的房子也快要滑进淤泥了。总之，我们四周的一切都是停滞的，都是淤泥。 我们重新登船，离岸而去，尽力划向前方。现在逆水行舟，倍加困难，幸亏赫伯特和斯塔特普坚持不懈，划啊，划啊，划啊，一直划到太阳向西下沉。这时河水上涨，小船升高，可以浏览岸上风光了。在河岸低低的水平线上，一轮红日正衬托在一片紫色的晚霞之中，迅速地使时光进入暮色。岸上是一片沼泽地，孤寂而单调；远处是隆起的高地，荒寂得寥无人烟；偶然地会在我们面前飞起一只水鸟，也显得凄凉忧愁。 黑夜的帷幕迅速降临，刚过满月的月亮当然是姗姗来迟。我们简单地商量了一下，很快便取得一致。显而易见，在我们前面的行程中，只要发现第一个荒凉寂寞的小酒店，我们就要上岸投宿。于是，他们两人又一次奋划双桨，而我却观看岸上，看是否能找到一处房屋。我们奋力往前，言语很少，沉闷地前行了大约四五英里路。这里寒气袭人，一艘运煤船从我们船边经过，船只的厨房中正生火烧饭，烟雾四射，火光闪跃，整条船看上去就像一座舒坦的宅第。此时夜色一片漆黑，而且在明天早晨降临之前不会改变，如果说尚有一些微亮，那不是来自天空，而是来自河上，是船桨在水里击起的几颗星光倒影。 在这凄凉孤寂的时刻，我们心中都明显地有一个念头，即我们正被跟踪着。潮水在上涨着，不时地但无规则地猛击着河岸。只要一听到潮水拍岸的声音，我们中的这一个人或那一个人便会被惊动，从而转眼向发声的地方望去。由于河水的冲击，河岸边出现了一些被水冲击而形成的小港湾，凡是这些地方我们都觉得可疑，心情紧张地望着这类港湾。有时一个人会问：“那水波的声音是什么？”声音问得很低。另一个人会答道：“那边是一条小船吧！”然后，我们大家都无言了，沉人一片静寂。我不耐烦地坐着并思虑着，怎么这两只桨在划水时会发出如此大的声音。 终于我们看到了一线灯光和一间屋子，立刻把船沿着堤岸划过去。这条河堤是用附近的石头堆砌而成的。其余三人留在船上，我一人踏到岸上，才发现这灯光是从一间小酒店的窗户射出来的。这地方真是够脏的了，但我敢打赌，对于那些走私冒险的人来说，这里却是个好地方。小酒店厨房中生着温暖的火，吃的东西有鸡蛋、火腿，喝的东西有各种美酒，店里还备有两个双人房间。店主说：“就只有这些了。”这里没有别的客人在场，只有店主、店主的妻子，和一位头发已白的老年人，他在这座小石堤上干打杂的活儿，全身泥泞不堪，好像他就是一根水标，刚才还浸泡在水里呢。 我带了这位打杂的帮手又回到了船上，让大家都离船登岸，同时把船上的桨、舵以及撑篙都拿出来，把船拉拖到岸上，准备在这里过夜。我们先在厨房的炉火边美美地吃了一餐，然后我们四人分住两间卧室。赫伯特和斯塔特普两人住一间，我和我所保护的人住在另一间。这两间屋子都弄得严严实实，密不通风，好像只要通一点风就会对生命有危险一样。我们还发现在床下面有许多脏衣服和装鞋帽的纸盒，我想不通这一家小旅社怎么会有这么多的鞋帽。但不管怎样我们都认为这里挺不错的，到哪里也难找到这么一个清静保险的地方。 晚餐过后，我们舒舒服服地在炉边烤火，那位打杂的正坐在一个角落里，脚上穿了一双肥大的靴子。我们还在吃着鸡蛋和火腿时他就向我们展示过这古董了，他告诉我们几天之前有一个淹死了的海员尸体被冲到岸边，他就从尸体上脱下了这双靴子。这时他问我是否看到过有一艘四人划的小船顺潮水而下。我告诉他没有见到，他说这条船一定是驶往下游了，但这船离开这里时是顺水而上的。 这位打杂的说：“那几个人定有什么原因，把船驶往下游了。” “你说的是一条有四只桨的小船吗？”我说道。 “有四个人划船，两个人乘船。”打杂的答道。 “他们在这里上岸的吗？” “他们带了个能装两加仑酒的瓦罐进来买啤酒。我真想在啤酒中给他们放上毒药，”打杂的说道，“或者放点什么使他们肚子咕咕叫的泻药。” “为什么呢？” “我当然有理由，”打杂的说道。他说得也是泥泞般糊涂，就好像泥浆灌进了他的喉咙管里一样。 “他以为，”店主人说道，这是个身体孱弱而善于思考的人，一对眼睛暗淡无光，看来各方面都得依赖这个打杂的，“他以为他们是那种人，其实看错了。” “我知道我没有看错人。”打杂的答道。 “喂，你说他们是海关上来的人吗？”店主人问道。 “当然。”打杂的答道。 “伙计，那你可错了。” “我会错？” 他的这声回答蕴涵了无限的深意，其中他对自己的见解又是无限的自信。这位打杂的脱下一只肥大的靴子，向靴子里望了一下，敲出几粒石子，掉在厨房的地上，然后又把靴子穿上。他这番动作表现出一个真正打杂人的神气，无论打什么赌，他总是对的。 “那么，伙计，他们身上的铜钮扣到哪去了，你又作何解释呢？”这位店主人踌躇不定、软弱地问道。 “铜钮扣到哪儿去了？”打杂的答道，“从船上扔到水里去了，吞到肚子里去了，种到地里去了，还会生出小钮扣来。你说钮扣到哪里去了！” “伙计，不要这么不要脸皮。”店主人一脸的不高兴，可怜地规劝道。 “海关上当官的人，”这打杂的人说道，“发现身上的铜钮扣和他们干的事不相称时，他们知道该怎么办。”他用最轻蔑的口吻又提到铜钮扣几个字，“一艘四桨小船，还乘了两个人，他们如果不是海关上来的，他们会在这里划来划去吗？一会儿顺潮水而下，一会儿又逆潮水而上；一会儿顺水去，一会儿逆水来。”说完他便一脸的轻视离开了。店主人也自感没趣，没有人来相帮，再谈这个问题也就没有意思了。 他们的这一番对话弄得我们大家都惶惶不安，而我更加感到不安。阴郁凄凉的风在屋外转来转去，潮水哗啦啦地拍着河岸，我心中暗想到，我们身人鸟笼，危机四伏了。一艘四桨的小船会不寻常地出没于此地，而且引起了这里人们如此的注意，这不得不使我想到情况的微妙。于是我把普鲁威斯送进房中休息，然后回到外间同我的两位伙伴商议。这时斯塔特普也已了解了事情的真相。我们讨论着究竟是应该留在这里，一直等到明天下午一点，轮船快到这里的时候再出发，还是明天一早就离开此地。结果我们认为，从总的看，还是留在这里为佳，一直等到轮船抵达这里前的一小时左右，我们再出外把小船划到轮船的航线上，然后慢悠悠地在潮水上荡着，等轮船来到。我们作出了这个决定之后，便回到房中各自睡觉。 我穿着几乎大部分的衣服入睡，睡了几个小时的好觉。一觉醒来，听到屋外的风声顿起，写有《轮船之家》的这小店的招牌被风吹得吱吱嘎嘎摇晃、砰砰乱撞，令我惊觉。于是我轻手轻脚地起身，不至于吵醒正在熟睡中的被保护人，走到窗口向外望去。一眼望去，正对着我们把船拖上岸的那个石堤，等我的眼睛慢慢适应那透过乌云发出的朦胧月光后，我看到有两个人正注视着小船，然后他们从窗下走过，再没有注视什么，更没有去到那座石码头，因为我看到那里什么人也没有。他们穿过沼泽地，直向诺尔的方向走去。 我立刻冲动起来，就想唤醒赫伯特，把这两个人的行踪告诉他。但是，就在要走进他的房间时我转而一想，虽然他住在后房，就在我住的房间的隔壁，而他和斯塔特普整天劳累，比我出的劳力大，一定很疲倦了，还是不要吵醒他。我回到我住的房间的窗口，看到那两个人还在沼泽地上行走着，然而，由于月色暗淡朦胧，很快便看不见了。这时我感到夜气寒冷，于是重又返回床上，躺下后对这件事慎重地恩考着，不久重又进入梦乡。 次日一早我们便起身。早饭之前，我们四个人一起出外散步，我认为我应该把夜里所见如实相告。他们听后，我的被保护人还是唯一一个最不感到忧愁的人。在他看来，这两个人完全可能是海关人员，他平静地认为，这两个人和我们之间毫无关系。我也尽量使自己如此去想，确实也就宽慰不少。尽管如此，我还是建议，他和我两个人一起先步行到一处远远可见的地点，然后小船再划过来接我们上船，或者在靠近那里的某个地方，总之，这一切要在中午时完成。无疑，这种做法是颇为慎重的。我们对一切防备措施作了讨论，早饭后，他和我便出发了。我们在小酒店里再没有谈任何事。 我们沿河而行，一路上他抽着烟斗，有时又停下来拍拍我的肩膀。在别人看来，好像现在处于危险的是我，而不是他，是他在安慰我，要我放心。我们很少讲话。我们靠近那里时，我要求他先在一个隐蔽的地方躲起来，我则去前面探察一下，因为昨天晚上那两个人就是向着这个方向去的。他同意我的看法，留了下来，我便一人独自前往。我到了那里，发现这里不像有船下过水，也不像有船被拉上来过，附近没有留下什么样痕迹表明那两个人在这里上过船。不过，说实在话，现在潮水已涨得很高，也许那些诸如脚印的痕迹已经被河水淹没了。 远远地，他从所隐蔽的地方伸出头来张望，我向着他挥动帽子，示意他可以走过来，于是他过来和我一起，我们在那里等着。有时我们裹着大衣躺在河岸边，有时又起来走动走动，以此来暖和暖和身体，一直等到我们的小船划来。船一到，我们便轻松自如地上了船，小船也便划到了轮船的航线上。这时候，离下午一时只有十分钟了，我们盼望着能见到轮船喷出的烟雾。 我们一直等到一点半钟才看到轮船喷出的烟雾，而且在这艘轮船的后面还有另外一艘轮船，它们都开足了马力全速向我们驶来。我们两人准备好了两只包裹，正在抓紧机会和赫伯特及斯塔特普道别。我们真心诚意地握着手，赫伯特及我的眼睛一直在流着泪。说时迟，那时快，就在这当口，有一艘四桨小船似箭般地从离我们不远的岸边射出，直向同一处航线驶来。 由于河道弯弯曲曲，刚才在我们和轮船喷出的烟雾之间有一处河岸隔着，而现在轮船已出现在我们面前。我招呼赫伯特和斯塔特普让船停在潮水前面，这样轮船上的人就会看到我们正在等着轮船；我又让普鲁威斯安静地坐在船上，裹住他的斗篷，不必着急。他心情愉快地答道：“亲爱的孩子，你尽管放心吧。”他坐在那里就像一尊石雕。这时那艘四桨小船熟练地包抄到了我们前面，和我们的小船并排而行，两船之间所隔的空间仅可划桨。它紧紧地靠拢我们的船，我们停桨荡船，他们也停桨荡船，我们划一两桨，他们也划一两桨。那艘船上坐着的两个人，有一个正掌着舵，眼睛紧紧地盯住我们望，另外四个桨手也紧紧地盯住我们望。另外一个坐着的人也像普鲁威斯一样，把自己裹得严严实实，而且全身哆嗦着。他对舵手低语了几句，又对我们望了几眼。两条船上的人都没有说一个字。 我和斯塔特普面对面坐着，他不到几分钟便弄清楚第一条轮船是哪一艘了，他用低低的声音对我说，那是汉堡号。这艘船正向我们飞快地驶来，叭哒叭哒拍水的声音越来越响。我感到船的身影已经罩向我们的时候，那小船也向我们喊话了。我回答了他们。 “你们船上有一名潜逃回国的流放犯人，”那只小船的舵手说道，“就是那个裹着斗篷的人。他叫做艾伯尔·马格韦契，也叫做普鲁威斯。我是来捉拿他的，我希望你们帮助我，让他投降。” 就在说话的一霎时，没有听到一声他对桨手的吩咐，他那艘船便向我们冲过来。他们突然在船前猛划一桨，便收起了桨，船也已斜向我们，抓住了我们的船边。我们还来不及想一下究竟是怎么回事，事情便发生了。这下子使轮船上的人们也给弄糊涂了，我听到他们在呼喊着我们，我听到有人命令停止开动螺旋桨，接着叭哒叭哒的声音停止了，不过我们仍然感到轮船以不可抗拒的威势向我们扑过来。我来不及思考，就看到那艘小船上的舵手一把抓住了他要捉拿的犯人的肩头，两条小船在潮水中被冲得直打圈子。轮船上的水手们也都一齐奔向船头，你争我挤地都想站到前面。真是说时迟那时快，我们船上的犯人一跃而起，蹿到捉拿者的后面，一把扯掉那个畏缩着坐在舱里的家伙身上的斗篷。立刻便暴露出一张脸，就是那张多少年前那另外一个犯人的脸，而且这张脸因恐惧变得苍白，整个人向后倒下去。只听到轮船上的人们一声惊叫，河里扑通一声，溅起一片浪花，我感到我们的小船直向水下沉去。 顷刻之间，我仿佛在成千的漩涡中和成千闪亮的浪花搏斗着；不一会儿，我被救到另一艘船上，赫伯特在那里，斯塔特普也在那里，而我们的小船已不知去向，两个犯人也不知在何方了。 轮船上的人们叫喊着。轮机愤怒地放着气，而轮船却在向前行驶着。我们的船也在向前行驶着，起初我弄得简直分不清哪儿是天，哪儿是水，哪儿是左岸，哪儿是右岸；但船员们以最快的速度使小船平稳，又迅速地划了几桨，然后又放下桨。每一个人都沉默不语、心情焦急地望着船后的水面。不久，看到水上有一个黑点，对着我们的方向漂浮而来。没有一个人发出声音，但见舵手把手一举，桨手们便一起向后划，使船正对着那个黑点。等黑点靠近，我才看清那是马格韦契。他在游着，不过已不那么自如。他被拉到船上，立刻便给戴上手铐脚镣。 小船保持了平稳，他们又开始默默无言、焦急万分地注视着水面。这时驶往鹿特丹的轮船也已到了，看上去船上的人不知道这里出了事，只是全速驶来。这里呼喊着要它停下来时，它已措手不及，于是两艘船从我们身旁驶过，使我们的船在掀起的巨大波浪上起伏颠簸。他们继续监视着河面，两艘船已过去很远，他们仍长时间地监视着。大家都心中有数，事到如此，怕再无希望了。 最后我们对另一个犯人放弃了希望，小船沿河岸划到了我们住过的那家酒店，店里的人看到我们后吃惊非小。在这里我才有机会让马格韦契得到一些安慰，因为他再不是普鲁威斯了。他的胸口受了重伤，头上被划了一个深深的口子。 他告诉我，他掉下水后肯定是落在了轮船的下面，在他想升起来时，头撞在船底而受了伤。至于他胸部的伤（看来是很重的，连呼吸时都感到十分痛苦），他说是撞在小船上造成的。他又告诉我，他不想说假话，当时他还没有决定该怎么样对付康佩生，只是他手刚一放到康佩生的斗篷上，想拉开斗篷看是不是他，这个家伙却怕得站起来，摇摇晃晃地向后倒去，于是两个人一起翻身掉到了河里。在他（马格韦契）正扭着对方突然翻身下水时，那个来捉拿他的人又来挡住他，结果使我们的小船也翻了。他又低低地对我耳语，他们两人落水之后，他们的四只胳膊死命地扭在一起，在水下进行搏斗，然后他从扭斗中解脱出来，冲出水面泅水而走。 我没有任何理由怀疑他告诉我的不是句句大实话，因为那条船掌舵的官员关于他们下水之事的说法也是相同的。 我请示这位官员准许我在这个小酒店里买几件多余的衣服，把犯人身上穿的已湿透了的衣服换下来，他立刻便同意了，但他说，犯人随身所带的每一件物品都必须交给他保管。于是，那只曾经在我手中有一段时期的钱夹子就交到了他的手上。他还准许我陪着犯人到伦敦去，但是我的两个朋友，就没有得到这份光荣了。 当官的告诉小酒店里那个打杂的，有个落水鬼在什么地方下了水，要他在尸体可能冲上岸的地方都去找一下。我看，他一听到尸体穿着长统袜，他的兴趣立刻高了起来。说不定他现在身上的这一套上下衣物是从十来个尸体身上脱下来的呢。怪不得他一身的穿戴是如此五花八门，其破烂的程度也是各不相同，其原因就在于此。 我们留在小酒店里，直到潮水转了方向，马格韦契才被带到小船，暂时押在那里。赫伯特和斯塔特普只有尽快地从陆路赶回伦敦了。我和他们悲伤凄然地道了别。然后，坐在马格韦契的身边，我顿生一种感觉，以后，只要他活在人间，我就得呆在他的身旁。 现在，我对他的一切厌恶不满均已消融；现在我抓住的这只手是一个已经被捕的、受了伤的、上了镣铐的人的手，我在他身上发现他对我有着无比的恩情，而他多少年来却诚心诚意、一如既往地对我怀着深情厚谊，感谢我少年时的一顿早餐和一把锉刀，竟以全部的所有和生命相报。现在他在我的眼里，我觉得他对我的感情比我对待乔的情感要高出不知多少。 黑夜降临，我发现他的呼吸越来越困难，他忍受着无比的痛苦，不时地从嘴里发出一声哀吟。我让他依偎在我那只好一些的臂膀上，他觉得怎样舒服就怎样倚。我的内心出现了一个可怕的念头，对于他的重伤我并不以为然，认为他如果死去了倒更好，因为有许多人都能够而且愿意证明他有罪，这是无可怀疑的。我决无幻想他会得到宽大处理，从他当初的审判来看，情况就很恶劣，监禁期间又越狱而逃，以后重新审判，在终身流放期间又潜逃回国，再说，这次他的原告又死于他手。 昨天我们于夕阳时分而至，今日我们又于夕阳时分而归，我们怀抱的希望亦如潮水向回流去。我无限心酸地对他说，他这次回国一切都为了我，而我是多么难过。 他对我说：“亲爱的孩子，这次来试试运气我已经十分满意。我看到了我的孩子，我肯定，就是没有我，我的孩子也会成为一个上流社会的人。” 这是不可能的。我们并排而坐时，我早就把这个问题想过一遍。这是不可能的。姑且不谈我自己的想法，就说温米克的暗示吧，现在看来是够明白的了。我已经料到，只要他一被定罪，他的财产就将全部归公，送交国库。 “亲爱的孩子，你听我说，”他说道，“最好你不要让别人知道你这个上流人物是由我培养的。只希望你来看看我，来时你就仿佛是偶然和温米克一起来的。我会受审多次，在最后一次受审时，希望你来，坐在一处我看得到你的地方。我再没有别的要求了。” 我对他说道：“只要允许我和你在一起，我决不会离开你。在天之父一定能够作证，你既待我如此真诚，我一定也待你同样真诚。” 这时我感到他握着我的手抖动着，他躺在船底，把脸转了过去，我听到他喉咙管里发出和过去一样格格格的怪音，不过如今已经柔和多了，和他这个人的其他各方面一样。幸亏他提到这点，使我想到了一个重要问题，否则只怕太迟了，那就是千万不能让他知道他想让我荣华富贵的希望实际上已经破灭。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/78/4562.html","bookId":540,"book":{"id":540,"title":"Great
