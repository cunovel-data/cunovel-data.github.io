{"id":35077,"no":55,"title":"Chapter 55","content":"There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some accurate knowledge of Magwitch\u0027s affairs. When his body was found, many miles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still legible, folded in a case he carried. Among these, were the name of a banking-house in New South Wales where a sum of money was, and the designation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His ignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr Jaggers\u0027s aid.\n After three days\u0027 delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness came, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial at the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.\n It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one evening, a good deal cast down, and said:\n `My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.\u0027\n His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he thought.\n `We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am very much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.\u0027\n `Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but my need is no greater now, than at another time.\u0027\n `You will be so lonely.\u0027\n `I have not leisure to think of that,\u0027 said I. `You know that I am always with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I should be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away from him, you know that my thoughts are with him.\u0027\n The dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to both of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.\n `My dear fellow,\u0027 said Herbert, `let the near prospect of our separation - for, it is very near - be my justification for troubling you about yourself. Have you thought of your future?\u0027\n `No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.\u0027\n `But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly words go, with me.\u0027\n `I will,\u0027 said I.\n `In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a--\u0027\n I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, `A clerk.\u0027\n `A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now, Handel - in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?\u0027\n There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying `Now, Handel,\u0027 as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone, stretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.\n `Clara and I have talked about it again and again,\u0027 Herbert pursued, `and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in her eyes, to say to you that if you will live with us when we come together, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her husband\u0027s friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well, Handel!\u0027\n I thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly. Secondly - Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.\n `But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury to your business, leave the questions open for a little while--\u0027\n `For any while,\u0027 cried Herbert. `Six months, a year!\u0027\n `Not so long as that,\u0027 said I. `Two or three months at most.\u0027\n Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement, and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week.\n `And Clara?\u0027 said I.\n `The dear little thing,\u0027 returned Herbert, `holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts; but he won\u0027t last long. Mrs Whimple confides to me that the is certainly going.\u0027\n `Not to say an unfeeling thing,\u0027 said I, `he cannot do better than go.\u0027\n `I am afraid that must be admitted,\u0027 said Herbert: `and then I shall come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I will walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed darling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book, and hasn\u0027t a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for the son of my mother!\u0027\n On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert - full of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me - as he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note a Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and over again, and then went to my lonely home - if it deserved the name, for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.\n On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him alone, since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had come, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure.\n `The late Compeyson,\u0027 said Wemmick, `had by little and little got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted, and it was from the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people being always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open, seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I thought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only suppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man, habitually to deceive his own instruments. You don\u0027t blame me, I hope, Mr Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.\u0027\n `I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most earnestly for all your interest and friendship.\u0027\n `Thank you, thank you very much. It\u0027s a bad job,\u0027 said Wemmick, scratching his head, `and I assure you I haven\u0027t been so cut up for a long time. What I look at, is the sacrifice of so much portable property. Dear me!\u0027\n `What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.\u0027\n `Yes, to be sure,\u0027 said Wemmick. `Of course there can be no objection to your being sorry for him, and I\u0027d put down a five-pound note myself to get him out of it. But what I look at, is this. The late Compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and being so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have been saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved. That\u0027s the difference between the property and the owner, don\u0027t you see?\u0027\n I invited Wemmick to come up-stairs, and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he was drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up to it, and after having appeared rather fidgety:\n `What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr Pip?\u0027\n `Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.\u0027\n `These twelve years, more likely,\u0027 said Wemmick. `Yes. I\u0027m going to take a holiday. More than that; I\u0027m going to take a walk. More than that; I\u0027m going to ask you to take a walk with me.\u0027\n I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just than, when Wemmick anticipated me.\n `I know your engagements,\u0027 said he, `and I know you are out of sorts, Mr Pip. But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness. It ain\u0027t a long walk, and it\u0027s an early one. Say it might occupy you (including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn\u0027t you stretch a point and manage it?\u0027\n He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little to do for him. I said I could manage it - would manage it - and he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his particular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half-past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.\n Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday morning, and was received by Wemmick himself: who struck me as looking tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two glasses of rum-and-milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his bedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.\n When we had fortified ourselves with the rum-and-milk and biscuits, and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it over his shoulder. `Why, we are not going fishing!\u0027 said I. `No,\u0027 returned Wemmick, `but I like to walk with one.\u0027\n I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said suddenly:\n `Halloa! Here\u0027s a church!\u0027\n There was nothing very surprising in that; but a gain, I was rather surprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea:\n `Let\u0027s go in!\u0027\n We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked all round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his his coat-pockets, and getting something out of paper there.\n `Halloa!\u0027 said he. `Here\u0027s a couple of pair of gloves! Let\u0027s put \u0027em on!\u0027\n As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side door, escorting a lady.\n `Halloa!\u0027 said Wemmick. `Here\u0027s Miss Skiffins! Let\u0027s have a wedding.\u0027\n That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves, a pair of white. The Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old gentleman round the waist, that he might present and equal and safe resistance. By dint of this ingenious Scheme, his gloves were got on to perfection.\n The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at those fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself as he took something out of his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, `Halloa! Here\u0027s a ring!\u0027\n I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; while a little limp pew opener in a soft bonnet like a baby\u0027s, made a feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of giving the lady away, devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergyman\u0027s being unintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus. When he said, `Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?\u0027 the old gentlemen, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments. Upon which, the clergyman said again, `WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man?\u0027 The old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice, `Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?\u0027 To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before saying that he gave, `All right, John, all right, my boy!\u0027 And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day.\n It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church, Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it, and put the cover on again. Mrs Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. `Now, Mr Pip,\u0027 said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came out, `let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a wedding-party!\u0027\n Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the Green, and there was a bagatelle board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick\u0027s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done.\n We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on table, Wemmick said, `Provided by contract, you know; don\u0027t be afraid of it!\u0027 I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the Castle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could.\n Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with him, and wished him joy.\n `Thankee!\u0027 said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. `She\u0027s such a manager of fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for yourself. I say, Mr Pip!\u0027 calling me back, and speaking low. `This is altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.\u0027\n `I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,\u0027 said I.\n Wemmick nodded. `After what you let out the other day, Mr Jaggers may as well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or something of the kind.\u0027\n \n 第二天他就被解往违警罪法庭，本来立刻就要对他的案件进行审理，只是有必要先送信通知当年他被关押的监狱船，来一位知道他案情的狱吏，证明他当时越狱的情况。本来对此案的案情是无人怀疑的，不过本来准备安排来作证的康佩生已落入潮水而死，所以出现了意外，在伦敦又找不出一个狱吏能提供必要的证明。我在回到伦敦的当天晚上直接去到贾格斯先生的私人宅第，请他办理此案。贾格斯先生答应受理，但对案情却不提一字。因为只有这样做才是唯一的途径，他告诉我，此案只要一有人证，在五分钟内就能定案，要想挽回是人力之所不可能，无疑，这定案将是对我们十分不利的。\n 我告诉贾格斯先生，马格韦契的钱袋已交给警官，我希望能瞒住这件事，不让他知道。贾格斯先生一听便很气愤，对我大加批评，说钱是“从我手指之间溜走了”，他认为必须要写一个备忘录，无论如何要弄回一部分。不过，他也不隐瞒我，他说，虽然有许多案件也不一定绝对没收财产，但这一个案件情况不同，它不具有免予充公的条件。我对这点非常清楚。我和犯人不具备亲戚继承关系，也没有其他的公认关系或联系。在他被捕之前既没有为我立下字据，也没有做出有关安排，如果现在来补行安排和立字据，根据法律已是无效了。我又不可能提出要求。因此我最后作出决定，而且以后不改变我的决定，即决不贪图毫无希望之财。\n 现在似乎有理由作如下设想，这位被淹死的通风告密的康佩生原来希望从充公的财物中得到好处，因为他对马格韦契的财产情况了解得非常清楚。这是从下面情况得到证实的。在离现场许多里之外发现了他的尸身，当时已面目全非，无法确认；只是他口袋里的东西还可证明是他。他口袋里有一个夹子，里面写的字条清晰可认，上面记载着在新南威尔士某个银行里马格韦契有多少存款，又注明了几处地产，价值可观。被关在狱中时，马格韦契把这些财产的清单交给了贾格斯先生，说是我以后可以继承的遗产。可怜的马格韦契，他的无知却对自己起了安慰的作用；他从未怀疑过，认为有了贾格斯先生的受理，我继承这笔财产是完全有把握的了。\n 案件审理延迟了三天，这几天是用来等待监狱船上来的证人的。证人三天后才来，一来，这件简单的案子便走了案。马格韦契暂时收监，等待下一期开庭再审理，下次开庭的时间是一个月之后。\n 这时是我一生中最黑暗的时期。一个晚上，赫伯特回来，万分沮丧，他说：\n “亲爱的汉德尔，我怕不得不留下你一个人了。”\n 因为他的合伙人已经和我打过招呼，我不会像赫伯特所想象的那样感到诧异。\n “我这次非到开罗去不可了，否则我们就会失去一次良机。汉德尔，在你最需要我的时候，我却非离开你不可。”\n “赫伯特，我永远需要你，因为我永远热爱你。我不仅仅现在需要你，而且任何时候我都需要你。”\n “你会感到孤独。”\n “我没有时间考虑到这些，”我说道，“你知道，只要在允许的时间内，我都得和他在一起，只要可能，我就会成天地和他待在一起。你知道，当我离开他，我的思想也是和他在一起的。”\n 他如此可怕的处境使赫伯特和我都受了惊吓。我们只能这么说，而不能讲得更加明白具体。\n “亲爱的老兄，”赫伯特说道，“我们的分手就在眼前——的的确确为时不远——我想打扰你一下，你是否谈谈自己呢，你有没有想过你的前途呢？”\n “我还没有想过呢，因为我实在不敢想我的前途。”\n “可是你不能不去想一想你的前途；说真的，我亲爱的汉德尔，你必须想一想你的前途。我希望你现在谈一谈，和我谈一谈一个朋友的知心话。”\n “可以。”我说道。\n “汉德尔，在我们的分公司中正需要一位——”\n 我看得很清楚，他在言词上尽量不用一个确切的词来表明他的用意，所以我替他说道：“需要一位办事员。”\n “是需要一位办事员，但将来发展成一个股东不是不可能的，你看你的老相识我不是已经从一个办事员发展成一个股东了吗？汉德尔，简单地说吧，我的老兄，你愿意到我的公司里来吗？”\n 他的态度表现出一种非常可爱的真诚，他在说“汉德尔”的时候，好像这个开头是十分严肃认真的，想干一份什么重要的大事，可是突然间他换了语气，又伸出了友谊的手，说起话来又像一个学童。\n “克拉娜和我已讨论过好几次，”赫伯特继续说道，“就在今天晚上，这个可爱的小东西还向我诉说呢，她满脸泪痕地说到你，说等她和我结婚后，你如果愿意和我们住在一起，她一定尽力使你过得愉快，她要让丈夫的朋友相信，丈夫的朋友也就是她的朋友。汉德尔，我们会相处很好的！”\n 我诚心诚意地感谢她，我也谈心诚意地感谢他，不过我告诉他，虽然他向我提供了这个好机会，我目前却不可能参加到他的分公司中去。首先，我的心思完全不在这里，考虑不到这个问题，其次——是的，其次在我的心中还徘徊着一个阴影，要到我这自述的末尾才能看清。\n “赫伯特，这个问题要是对你的事业没有损坏，我的看法是，你还是把这个问题放在一边——”\n “放多少时间都行，”赫伯特说道，“六个月怎么样，一年呢？”\n “不需要那么长，”我说道，“至多两三个月吧。”\n 我们达成协议后便握手祝贺。赫伯特兴致勃勃地说，他现在可以鼓足勇气来告诉我，就在本周末他便要和我告别了。\n “克拉娜怎么办呢？”我问道。\n “这个可爱的小东西嘛，”赫伯特说道，“只要她父亲活着一天，她就要尽一天孝道，不过他活不长了。蕴普尔夫人真心地告诉我，他很快就要死了。”\n “说句不好听的话，”我说道，“他死了倒比活着好。”\n “我看这一点也不错，”赫伯特说道，“到那时我就回来看望这亲爱的小东西，这亲爱的小东西和我就静悄悄地走到一个最近的教堂。记住！这个幸福的人不是出于名门大户，亲爱的汉德尔，从来没有查过什么贵族谱这一类的书，对自己祖父一点印象都没有。我妈妈的儿子是多么幸福啊！”\n 就在这个星期的星期六，赫伯特乘上邮车向海港而去。我和他两人分了手。他带着无限光明的远景和我告别，不过心中仍然有些凄然和难过。他走之后，我去到一家咖啡馆，在那里给克拉娜写了一封短信，告诉她赫伯特已经出发，转达了他对她表示的一次又一次的爱意。然后，我回到自己孤寂的家，如果这里还够得上称为 “家”的话。我可以说已是无家可归了，因为现在这里已不能再当作“家’了。\n 我在上楼梯时正碰到温米克从楼上下来，他在楼上敲我的门，见没有人答应才下来的。自从那次企图出逃失败之后我还没有单独见到过他。他这次是以私人的身份和个人之间的关系来看我，准备和我谈谈心，就出逃失败的原因作一次分析。\n “那个死掉的康佩生，”温米克说道，“一点一点顺藤摸瓜，把整个的事情都弄得一清二楚。所有这些我都是从他手下的几个人那里听来的，这几个手下人都是惹上麻烦的（他手下有一些人总是惹上麻烦），我把听来的都告诉了你。在他们讲这些事情时我表面上装作掩耳不闻，其实我张开两耳留着神呢。上次听到康佩生不在伦敦的消息，我想这是个绝好的机会干这件事。现在我才恍然大悟，这原来是他的策略，这个人非常聪明，连自己的心腹有时也会耍欺骗手段。你不要责怪我，皮普，我想你不会吧？我是真心诚意想帮你忙的，我这可完全是真话。”\n “温米克，我绝对相信你说的话，我真挚地向你表示谢意，谢谢你对我的关心和给我的友谊。”\n “谢谢你的好意，非常感谢你。我办了一件坏事，”温米克抓抓头皮，说道，“我敢说我已经多年没有办错一件事了。而这次，我说，做了多大牺牲，大笔动产失去了。天啦！”\n “温米克，我所想到的只是这笔动产的可怜的主人。”\n “那当然，那当然，”温米克说道，“当然我不反对你因为他而感到心里难过，其实，如果能够救出他，叫我拿出五镑钞票我也乐意。不过呢，我自有看法。那个死掉的康佩生既然事先获得他回国的信息，既然下定决心要让他吃官司，我看他想逃也逃不了。而动产的情况就不同了，它是可救的。动产和动产的所有人有区别，这点你难道不懂吗？”\n 我请温米克到楼上去，喝一杯掺水烈性酒，暖暖身子休息一下，然后再回伍尔华斯。他接受了我的盛情邀请。他喝了我给他的一杯酒，显出有些烦躁不安，然后突然说出下面的话，和原来的话题毫无联系。\n “皮普先生，我准备星期一休息一天，你看怎么样？”\n “真的，我看你一年十二个月中一天也没有休息过。”\n “不要说十二个月，更该说十二年来没有休息过。”温米克说道，“确实，我准备休息一天。不仅休息，我还准备出去走走。不仅去走走，我还要约请你同我一起出去走走。”\n 我正想说请他谅解，由于心境恶劣，不想出去走，而温米克已经料到我有这一招。\n “皮普先生，我知道你有事情，”他说道，“我也知道你的心境不好，只要你答应这一次走走，我对你是很感谢的。这次走动不会很远，但要早一些，比如说上午八时到十二时吧（包括早饭在内），就这四小时。你能不能抽出一些时间和我走一趟呢？”\n 过去有许多次他都帮了我许多忙，今天为了他这区区小事又算得什么呢。我便说我能设法和他出去走走，我一定尽力想办法。他听我同意后显得非常高兴，我也很高兴。由于他特殊的要求，所以我们约定好，星期一上午八时半我到城堡去叫他，然后我们便告别了。\n 星期一早晨我准时到达城堡，拉了拉门上的铃，温米克亲自出来接我。今天我发现他比往日打扮得漂亮得多，头上戴的帽子也更加柔软光滑。在屋内，已备好了两杯朗姆酒，而且兑了牛奶，另外也放好了两份饼干。老人家恐怕也早被云雀吵醒了，我远远地向他的卧室望去，他的床上空空如也。\n 我们完成了朗姆酒兑牛奶，外加饼干的任务，正准备出发散步消耗掉这份供应，突然看到温米克拿出一根钓鱼竿，把它往肩上一扛。这一下使我吃惊不小，我便问他：“怎么，我们去钓鱼吗？”温米克答道：“不去钓鱼。不过我喜欢出去时背上一根钓鱼竿。”\n 我觉得事情有些蹊跷，不过我一言未发，便两人一起出发了。我们向坎坡威尔草地的方向走去，快走到那一带时，温米克突然说道：\n “喂！这儿可有一个教堂呢！”\n 我并不觉得这句话有什么值得惊讶的，不过我感到奇怪的是他好像有了什么灵感，想出一个奇妙的主意，说道：\n “我们到教堂里面去看看。”\n 我们走了进去，温米克把钓鱼竿放在门廊里，旋即向四周望了一下。就这时，温米克把手伸进大衣的口袋里，掏出一件纸包的东西。\n “啊呀！”他说道，“这里有两副手套呢！我们每人套上一副！”\n 这手套是小山羊皮制成的。这时他的那张邮筒式的嘴巴大大地张开着，由此我对他的这次行动也起了特别的怀疑。同时，我看到老人家也来了，从边门走进来，和他一起来的还有一位小姐，这样我的怀疑也就证实了。\n “啊呀！”温米克说道，“司琪芬小姐到了！我们的婚礼就开始了。”\n 这位斯斯文文的女郎穿的衣服也像往常一样，只是现在她正脱去手上的一副绿山羊皮手套，换上了一副白色的。老人家也同样准备向哈埃曼这位婚姻之神的祭坛奉献上同样的礼品。不过这位老先生简直没有办法戴上这副手套，温米克不得不来帮点忙，让老先生背倚在教堂柱子上，自己站在这根柱子的后面，用这种方法给他拉上手套，我也过来一把抱住老先生的腰，这样使得双方力量平衡起来，不至于不安全。耍了这么一个小技巧，手套总算套了上去，而且戴得很整齐，可说是达到尽善尽美。\n 教堂中的牧师和办事员走了出来，我们便按顺序站在终身大事的栏杆前。温米克那个样子似乎毫无事前准备，完全是偶然碰上的。在婚礼仪式开始之前，温米克从背心口袋里掏出一样东西自言自语地说道：“嗨！这里还有一枚戒指呢！”\n 我扮演的是陪新郎的角色，也就是新郎的男傧相；教堂里走出来一位身材矮小、柔弱无力的女人，是个领座员，头上戴了一顶柔软的无边帽，真像一顶娃娃帽，由她当司琪芬小姐的心腹女友。嫁姑娘的责任则移到了老人家的身上，而老人家却无意中引起了牧师的大为不满。事情是这样的，牧师问道：“是谁把这位小姐嫁给这位先生的？”而这位老先生根本就不知道现在结婚仪式进行到哪一个项目了，站在那里对着写在墙上的十诫温厚宽容地笑着。牧师看到这里又一次问道：“是谁把这位小姐嫁给这位先生的？”可是这位老先生还是一副若无其事的样子，只顾自己自得其乐，对牧师问话全然不顾。所以新郎用以往的那种声音对他喊道：“老爸爸，你知道吧，是谁嫁女儿？”老人家在说是谁嫁女儿之前却轻松活泼地说道：“对极了，约翰，对极了，我的孩子！”这时牧师满脸阴沉怒气，停顿了下来。这使我有些惶恐不安，今天能不能顺利完成婚礼倒是遇上麻烦了。\n 然而这次婚礼却顺利地结束了，我们走出教堂，温米克掀开圣水盘上的盖子，把自己的白手套放在里面，然后又随手把盖子放上。温米克夫人却指望将来，一切向前看，所以把白手套放进了口袋，换戴上那副绿色手套。温米克在走出来时又得意洋洋地扛上那根鱼竿，对我说道：“你倒说说，谁会想到这里举行的是一场婚礼？”\n 早餐已经定好，是在一家位于斜坡之上的令人兴致雅然的小酒店里，就在一英里多地的绿地上方。在酒店的正厅中放着一张台球桌，这是为了在严肃的结婚典礼之后轻松一下心情而准备的。温米克伸出手臂挽住温米克太太的腰部时，她再不把他的手臂推开。她坐在一张靠墙的高背椅上，就像放在匣里的大提琴一样，当琴师需要演奏的时候，就让他任意地拥抱。看到这一点可真叫我从心眼里高兴。\n 我们享受了一顿非常可口的早餐，无论是谁，只要对某一道菜不动刀叉，温米克便会说道：“所有的菜都是定好的，你们尽管放心大开胃口好了。”我向新郎新娘祝酒，向老人家祝酒，向城堡祝酒，在辞别时我又向新娘致意，尽量使自己显得落落大方，心情愉快。\n 温米克把我送到门口，我又一次和他紧紧地握手，并且祝他幸福快乐。\n “谢谢你！”温米克搓着双手说道，“你可一点儿也不知道吧，她可是个养鸡能手呢。什么时候到我们家来品尝一下鸡蛋你就会知道了。”说着他又拖我回来低低说道：“皮普先生，我告诉你，这可是伍尔华斯的心情。”\n “放心吧，我不会在小不列颠街提到这件事的。”我说道。\n 温米克对我点点头，说道：“哪一天说不定你会把这件事给捅出来，但千万不要让贾格斯先生知道。他会说我变得心慈手软了什么的。”\n \n
