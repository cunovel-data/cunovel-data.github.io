{"id":35064,"no":42,"title":"Chapter 42","content":"`I know\u0027d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen\u0027d Abel. How did I know it? Much as I know\u0027d the birds\u0027 names in the hedges to be chaffinch, sparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as the birds\u0027 names come out true, I supposed mine did.\n `So fur as I could find, there warn\u0027t a soul that see young Abel Magwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at him, and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up, took up, to that extent that I reg\u0027larly grow\u0027d up took up.\n `This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as much to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for there warn\u0027t many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the name of being hardened. \"This is a terrible hardened one,\" they says to prison wisitors, picking out me. \"May be said to live in jails, this boy. \"Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured my head, some on \u0027em - they had better a measured my stomach - and others on \u0027em giv me tracts what I couldn\u0027t read, and made me speeches what I couldn\u0027t understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But what the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach, mustn\u0027t I? - Howsomever, I\u0027m a getting low, and I know what\u0027s due. Dear boy and Pip\u0027s comrade, don\u0027t you be afeerd of me being low.\n `Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could - though that warn\u0027t as often as you may think, till you put the question whether you would ha\u0027 been over-ready to give me work yourselves - a bit of a poacher, a bit of a labourer, a bit of a waggoner, a bit of a haymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don\u0027t pay and lead to trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a Traveller\u0027s Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write. I warn\u0027t locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my good share of keymetal still.\n `At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi\u0027 a man whose skull I\u0027d crack wi\u0027 this poker, like the claw of a lobster, if I\u0027d got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and that\u0027s the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch, according to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night.\n `He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he\u0027d been to a public boarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was a good-looking too. It was the night afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth that I know\u0027d on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when I went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a sporting one) called him out, and said, \"It hink this is a man that might suit you\" - meaning I was.\n `Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of clothes.\n `\"To judge from appearances, you\u0027re out of luck,\" says Compeyson to me.\n `\"Yes, master, and I\u0027ve never been in it much.\" (I had come out of Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have been for something else; but it warn\u0027t.)\n `\"Luck changes,\" says Compeyson; \"perhaps yours is going to change.\"\n `I says, \"I hope it may be so. There\u0027s room.\"\n `\"What can you do?\" says Compeyson.\n `\"Eat and drink,\" I says; \"if you\u0027ll find the materials.\"\n `Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five shillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.\n `I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on to be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson\u0027s business in which we was to go pardners? Compeyson\u0027s business was the swindling, handwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts of traps as Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs out of and get the profits from and let another man in for, was Compeyson\u0027s business. He\u0027d no more heart than a iron file, he was as cold as death, and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.\n `There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur - not as being so chrisen\u0027d, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a shadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore, and they\u0027d made a pot of money by it; but Compeyson betted and gamed, and he\u0027d have run through the king\u0027s taxes. So, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him, and Compeyson\u0027s wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity on him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody.\n `I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn\u0027t; and I won\u0027t pretend I was partick\u0027ler - for where \u0027ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade? So I begun wi\u0027 Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur lived at the top of Compeyson\u0027s house (over nigh Brentford it was), and Compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in case he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled the account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a tearing down into Compeyson\u0027s parlour late at night, in only a flannel gown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson\u0027s wife, \"Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can\u0027t get rid of her. She\u0027s all in white,\" he says, \"wi\u0027 white flowers in her hair, and she\u0027s awful mad, and she\u0027s got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she says she\u0027ll put it on me at five in the morning.\"\n `Says Compeyson: \"Why, you fool, don\u0027t you know she\u0027s got a living body? And how should she be up there, without coming through the door, or in at the window, and up the stairs?\"\n `\"I don\u0027t know how she\u0027s there,\" says Arthur, shivering dreadful with the horrors, \"but she\u0027s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed, awful mad. And over where her heart\u0027s brook - you broke it! - there\u0027s drops of blood.\"\n `Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. \"Go up alonger this drivelling sick man,\" he says to his wife, \"and Magwitch, lend her a hand, will you?\" But he never come nigh himself.\n `Compeyson\u0027s wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most dreadful. \"Why look at her!\" he cries out. \"She\u0027s a shaking the shroud at me! Don\u0027t you see her? Look at her eyes!Ain\u0027t it awful to see her so mad?\" Next, he cries, \"She\u0027ll put it on me, and then I\u0027m done for! Take it away from her, take it away!\" And then he catched hold of us, and kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed I see her myself.\n `Compeyson\u0027s wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the horrors off, and by-and-by he quieted. \"Oh, she\u0027s gone!Has her keeper been for her?\" he says. \"Yes,\" says Compeyson\u0027s wife. \"Did you tell him to lock her and bar her in?\" \"Yes.\" \"And to take that ugly thing away from her?\" \"Yes, yes, all right.\" \"You\u0027re a good creetur,\" he says, \"don\u0027t leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!\"\n `He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and then he starts up with a scream, and screams out, \"Here she is!She\u0027s got the shroud again. She\u0027s unfolding it. She\u0027s coming out of the corner. She\u0027s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you - one of each side - don\u0027t let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time. Don\u0027t let her throw it over my shoulders. Don\u0027t let her lift me up to get it round me. She\u0027s lifting me up. Keep me down!\" Then he lifted himself up hard, and was dead.\n `Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and me was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own book - this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade on.\n `Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done - which \u0027ud take a week - I\u0027ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip\u0027s comrade, that that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always in debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a getting into danger. He was younger than me, but he\u0027d got craft, and he\u0027d got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi\u0027 - Stop though! I ain\u0027t brought her in--\u0027\n He looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in the book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and spread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them on again.\n `There ain\u0027t no need to go into it,\u0027 he said, looking round once more. `The time wi\u0027 Compeyson was a\u0027most as hard a time as ever I had; that said, all\u0027s said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanour, while with Compeyson?\u0027\n I answered, No.\n `Well!\u0027 he said, `I was, and got convicted. As to took up on suspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both committed for felony - on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation - and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me, \"Separate defences, no communication,\" and that was all. And I was so miserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back, afore I could get Jaggers.\n `When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman Compeyson looked, wi\u0027 his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked. When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the evidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had come for\u0027ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit. But, when the defence come on, then I see the plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, \"My lord and gentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and only suspected; t\u0027other, the elder, always seen in \u0027em and always wi\u0027his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one?\" And such-like. And when it come to character, warn\u0027t it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn\u0027t it his schoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn\u0027t it him as had been know\u0027d by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to his disadvantage? And warn\u0027t it me as had been tried afore, and as had been know\u0027d up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups? And when it come to speech-making, warn\u0027t it Compeyson as could speak to \u0027em wi\u0027 his face dropping every now and then into his white pocket-handkercher - ah! and wi\u0027 verses in his speech, too - and warn\u0027t it me as could only say, \"Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most precious rascal\"? And when the verdict come, warn\u0027t it Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and giving up all the information he could agen me, and warn\u0027t it me as got never a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, \"Once out of this court, I\u0027ll smash that face of yourn!\" ain\u0027t it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And when we\u0027re sentenced, ain\u0027t it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen, and ain\u0027t it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so well, and ain\u0027t it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to worse?\u0027\n He had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching out his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, `I ain\u0027t a going to be low, dear boy!\u0027\n He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.\n `I had said to Compeyson that I\u0027d smash that face of his, and I swore Lord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I couldn\u0027t get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at him, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn\u0027t a strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying them as was in \u0027em and all over, when I first see my boy!\u0027\n He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent to me again, though I had felt great pity for him.\n `By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to get quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him down. I smashed his face. \"And now,\" says I \"as the worst thing I can do, caring nothing for myself, I\u0027ll drag you back.\" And I\u0027d have swum off, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I\u0027d a got him abroad without the soldiers.\n `Of course he\u0027d much the best of it to the last - his character was so good. He had escaped when he was made half-wild by me and my murderous intentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought to trial again, and sent for life. I didn\u0027t stop for life, dear boy and Pip\u0027s comrade, being here.\u0027\n `He wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took his tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his button-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.\n `Is he dead?\u0027 I asked, after a silence.\n `Is who dead, dear boy?\u0027\n `Compeyson.\u0027\n `He hopes I am, if he\u0027s alive, you may be sure,\u0027 with a fierce look. `I never heerd no more of him.\u0027\n Herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his eyes on the fire, and I read in it:\n `Young Havisham\u0027s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham\u0027s lover.\u0027\n I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by; but we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he stood smoking by the fire.\n \n “亲爱的孩子和皮普的朋友，我来告诉你们关于我的生活经历，这是身世，不是一首歌，也不是讲故事。为了先让你们简单扼要地了解我的情况，不妨引几句英国人嘴上流行的顺口溜：‘进牢房出牢房，出了牢房进牢房，进了牢房出牢房，进进出出断了肠。’你们看这意思多清楚，这就是我的身世，就这样我交上了皮普这位朋友，以后便被装上船，并且被押送到海外。\n “我经受过所有的刑罚，所幸的是还没有领教过绞刑。有时他们把我当作一把银茶壶锁了起来，有时他们用车把我装到这里，运到那里，从这个城市装出，又从那个城市运走。我被他们戴上足枷，被他们鞭打，被他们折磨、驱赶。至于我出生于何处，我连一点概念也没有。我最早知道世上有我这个人时，那是在艾塞克斯，为了活命而偷萝卜吃。和我在一起的有一个男人，是个补锅匠。他后来离我而去，带走了他的火炉，只留下我一个人挨着寒冷的煎熬。\n “我知道我叫马格韦契，教名是艾伯尔。我是怎么知道我的名字的呢？这就好比我知道树篱上的鸟儿的名称，这是燕雀，那是麻雀，还有画眉，我就像知道鸟儿的名字那样知道了自己的名字。我起先也怀疑过我的名字可能是乱说的吧，可是鸟儿的名字叫起来都是真的，我想我的名字也错不了。\n “据我的记忆，这个小艾伯尔·马格韦契身上没衣穿，肚中无食吃，没有一个人不讨厌他，要么赶他走，要么捉住他。于是我就这样被他们捉来捉去，最后就被捉大了起来。\n “情况就是这样，那时我是个衣衫褴褛的小东西，我想世上没有人再比我更可怜了，不过我可没照过镜子。因为我到过许多人家，都没有发现那玩艺儿。就那时我就得到了小惯犯这个名称。来到牢房探监的客人一走进来，狱吏便对他们指着我说：‘这是个厉害的小惯犯，可以说他就是在牢房中生活的，不要小看他是个孩子。’ 然后他们打量着我，我也打量着他们。他们打量着我的脑袋，其实他们最好应打量一下我的肚子；有的给我几本我根本看不懂的《回头是岸》一类的宗教小册子，有的对我讲些从善改恶的劝教，我根本也听不懂。他们总是再三地说我遇上了魔鬼。什么魔鬼，和我有个屁关系？我要紧的是填肚子，难道我要饿死吗？对不起，我又粗野不文明起来了，亲爱的孩子和皮普的朋友，你们不必担心我会讲粗野不文明的话，我知道该怎么办的。\n “我到处流浪，到处行乞，到处偷东西，有时遇上机会也会劳动一下。你们不要以为这种机会很多，你们不妨问问自己，你们是不是会把活儿给我干？有时到人家庄园里私下偷猎，有时当一个帮工，有时帮人家赶车、翻干草，有时也做点小贩什么的，总之，干得多拿得少，大部分活儿不仅得不到报酬，而且多招惹麻烦，我就是在这种情况下长大的。在一家旅行客店中有一个开小差的兵，全身裹着破布，一直裹到下巴，他教我读书。后来又遇上个周游四方的大汉，专门为人家签一个名收一个便士，他教了我一阵子写字。这个阶段比起以前来，我被锁进牢房的次数少了，但不管怎样，那柄开关牢房的钥匙被磨得越来越细，和我的‘多进宫’有不少的关系。\n 二十多年以前，我在艾普瑟姆赛马场上认识了一个人，要是我有机会再碰到他，一定用这根火钳像大虾子的钳子一样把他的头钳碎。这个人就是康佩生。亲爱的孩子，这个人就是你看到和我在沟渠中扭打的那个人，就是昨晚我走了之后你和你朋友谈到的那个人。\n “正是这个康佩生，他在公立寄宿学校读过书，受过教育，原是要培养成绅士的。他十分善于言谈，总是以上流社会中的人士自居，模样生得也还不错。那是一次大赛马的前夜，我在荒原上的一家我常去的小棚酒家中看到了他。我进这家酒店时，他正和几个其他的人坐在店中。店老板认识我，是个善于投机冒险的人，便招呼了他一声，大声说道：‘我看这个人倒挺适合你的。’他说的这个人就是指我。\n “康佩生非常专注地看着我，我也盯住他望。他有一只带链子的挂表挂在身上，手上戴着戒指，衣服上别了胸针，衣服的质地是挺讲究的。\n “‘从体外表的气色看你不太走运吧。’康佩生对我说。\n “‘噢，先生，是这样，我从来就没有走过运。’（那时我刚从金斯顿监狱放出来不久，是犯了流浪罪被关进去的。即使不是流浪罪也会因别的罪被关进去；不过那一次确是流浪罪而不是别的。）\n “‘时来就会运转，’康佩生说道，‘也许你的运气正在好转呢。’\n “我说：‘我希望时来运转，就等待机会吧。’\n “‘你能干什么呢？’康佩生问道。\n “我答道：‘你要有什么养活我的东西，我是能吃能喝的。’\n “康佩生笑着，又非常专注地盯住我望，然后给了我五个先令，叫我明天晚上再来，在同一个地方。\n “第二天晚上我到老地方去见康佩生，康佩生让我成为他的人，并且和他合作。康佩生要我和他合伙究竟是干什么呢？原来他干的是招摇撞骗、伪造字据、偷窃银钱并迅速甩出，等等，所有在康佩生脑子里能想得出来的各种陷阱、圈套，他都装得若无其事和他无关，而得到的好处却从不放过，出了问题让别人受过，这些都是他干的买卖。他的心完全可以和钢锉比坚硬，他这个人和死尸一样冷酷，他的头脑就像刚才所提到的魔鬼一样。\n “康佩生还有一个同伙，别人都叫他亚瑟，其实这并不是他的教名，而是他的诨名。他正患有严重的肺病，看上去形似幽灵。他和康佩生两个人狼狈为奸，合伙在许多年前欺骗了一位富家小姐，因此发了大财。可是康佩生又会赌钱，又要赛马，像他这样大手大脚，皇室国库也不够他花，所以骗来的钱都被他花光了。而亚瑟却正病入膏盲，越来越穷，还恐惧缠身。康佩生的妻子（康佩生经常对她拳打脚踢）却尽量地给予他同情，而康佩生对于任何事物和任何人都毫无怜悯之心。\n “我本可以从亚瑟身上吸取教训，但是我没有；我无须假装我有什么特殊，我有什么地方可以逞能呢？亲爱的孩子和朋友，所以我和康佩生鬼混在一起，成为他手中一个可怜的工具。亚瑟住在康佩生住宅的顶楼屋子中，那里距离布兰特福德很近，康佩生把他这里的住费用费都详细记录在册，只要他身体一好就要他干活偿还。不过亚瑟却很快还清了这笔账。我记得第二次或第三次看到他时，那是一个深夜，他突然从顶楼狂奔而下，跑到康佩生的会客室中，只穿了一件法兰绒的长睡衣，全部头发都被汗水浸湿。他对康佩生的妻子说道：‘萨莉，她正在楼上和我无理取闹，我简直无法摆脱她。她全身都穿着白的，在头发间还插了白花，她都气疯了，在她的手臂上搭了一块裹尸布，她还说明天早晨五时就用这裹尸布把我裹起来。’\n “康佩生说：‘你这个大笨蛋，难道你不知道她现在还活着？她怎么会爬到这楼上来呢？她没有从门口进来，又没有从窗口进来，怎么上了楼梯呢？’\n “‘我也不知道她是怎么进来的，’亚瑟当时恐惧到极点，全身发抖，‘可是她就站在床前的一个角落里，那副气疯了的样子。她的心都碎了，是你把她的心弄碎的！血还从她心中一滴一滴地滴下来。’\n “康佩生嘴上很硬，事实上是个懦夫。他对他的妻子说：‘你把这个说梦话的病人送上楼去；还有你马格韦契，你帮她一起送他上去，怎么样？’而他自己不敢挪动一步。\n “康佩生的妻子和我重新把他扶到楼上，让他躺到床上，他却没命地说着胡话：‘你们没有看到她吗！她正打开裹尸布向我身上裹来！你们还没有看到她吗？看看她的眼睛！看她那副气疯的样子多么可怕啊2把裹尸布从她手中夺下来，把它夺下来！’然后他便一把抓住我们，继续和那个她讲话、答话，弄得我都半信半疑，仿佛我也看到了那个她。\n “康佩生的妻子对他的这种情况已经习以为常，这时给了他一些酒喝，使他的恐惧消散。没有多久他安静下来，‘噢，现在她走了！是管她的人来把她领走的吗？’ 他说。‘是的。’康佩生的妻子说。‘你有没有关照他把门锁上，关好她？’‘说了。’‘你叫他把她手中拿的那东西夺下了吗？’‘叫了，叫了，一切都关照好了。’他说道：‘你可真是个好人，可千万别离开我，现在我求你了，无论如何你别走！’\n “他睡在那里十分安静，一直到次日早晨五时还差几分的时候，他突然从床上大叫一声跳了起来。他大声惊叫着：‘她又来了！她手中又拿来了裹尸布。她正把裹尸布散开。她从角落里走出来了！她向这边走来了。快抱住我，你们两个都抱住我，一边一个，不要让她的裹尸布碰到我！哈！这次可没有碰上。不要让她把裹尸布撒在我的肩头上。不要让她把我拎起来裹。她来拖我了，快把我向下按住！’接着，他的身子向上挺了一下，便死了。\n “康佩生对于他的死处之泰然，认为简直是拔除了一个眼中钉，对双方都有利。他和我也就忙碌了起来。这个滑头的家伙做的第一件事就是要我拿着这本《圣经》发誓。亲爱的孩子，这就是这本小黑书，就是我要你朋友发誓的小黑书。\n “至于康佩生如何想坏主意，我是如何给他卖命这些事就不必细言了，因为太多了，一个礼拜也讲不完。我只想简单地告诉你们，亲爱的孩子和皮普的朋友，告诉你们这个家伙是怎样把我引进他的罗网，成为他的黑奴。我永远欠他的债，永远被他牵着鼻子转，永远为他马前马后卖命，永远为他赴汤蹈火。他比我年轻，可是他的鬼点子比我多，比我有学问，可以说比我要胜过五百倍，而且心狠手辣。我和我的太太当时也正处于艰难时期，还是不提她了！我不让她也卷进去——”\n 这时他带着惶恐的心情看了一下四周，仿佛忘掉了自己正回忆到什么地方；然后，他转回面孔对着火炉，把两手放在膝头上摊得更大，一会儿挪开，一会儿又放口到膝盖上。\n “详情无须细说，”他又环顾了一下四周，说道，“我和康佩生相处的日子是我生活中最艰难的一段；就是这样。我说没说过，在我和康佩生一起混的那段时间中，为了一桩轻罪，我还单独受过审？”\n 我说他没有说过。\n “好吧！”他说道，“我说一下，当时我受了审又定了罪。至于我因为有嫌疑而被逮捕的事，在持续的四五年之间有过两三次，但最后都证据不足。事情总归会败露，康佩生和我两个人都犯了重罪，因为偷盗货币，还有几个别的罪名。当时康佩生对我说：‘自找律师，分别辩护，互不联系。’这就是他说的一切。我那时是个穷光蛋，只有变卖了所有的衣服，只留下身上穿的，才找到了贾格斯为我讲话。\n “当他也被押到法庭被告席上的时候，我第一眼就注意到康佩生打扮得多么像一个绅土啊，一头鬈发，穿着黑色礼眼，手中拿着雪白的手帕；相比之下我多么像一个可怜的坏蛋。起诉一开始，要简短地举出证据，我一看就明白，凡是重大罪证都推到我身上，而轻的却和他有关。当证人到庭时，我又注意到他们总是把我说成是出头露面的首要分子，并且一再发誓，所有的钱都是交在我的手上，我总是插手干每一件坏事，总是从中得到利益。在被告律师开始辩护时，对他们的阴谋我看得更清楚了。就看康佩生请来的那位辩护律师吧，他说： ‘法官大人，先生们，你们看到在你们面前并排站着两个人。你们的眼睛一看便能分清，一个比较年轻，受过良好教育，在判决时就应考虑到他的这些条件；而另一个比较年长，没有受过教育，判决时也应考虑到这些。这年轻些的，很难看出他和这些案件有关，不过是有点嫌疑而已；至于这年长些的，一看就和案件有关系，他必须服罪。在这两个人中如果只有一个人犯罪，或者在这两个人中，虽两个都犯罪，哪一个罪重，难道还会有怀疑吗？’等等，他讲的都是诸如此类的话。至于涉及到我们两个人的品质，他又说康佩生受过教育，他的同学不是在这里就是在那里干事，都有地位；这些证人都和他相识，在这个俱乐部或那个社团中见过面，总不至于说对他不利的话。至于我可不同了，以前受过审讯，在监狱、感化院。拘留所，哪儿他们不认识我？再说到我们的言语方面，康佩生与他们一谈话便低下他的面孔，还掏出白手帕掩住面孔，不时在语言中还夹几句诗，一遇到我，我只会说：‘先生们，站在我旁边的这个家伙是个罪大恶极的流氓坏蛋。’等到判决一定，结果康佩生因为原来品质好，只是交上了坏朋友，而他又能尽力检举揭发我，所以对他是宽大处理。至于对我的判决除了罪名外，再没有其他的话。当时我对康佩生说： ‘只要出了这个法庭，我就要砸碎你的面孔！’康佩生连忙请求法官对他进行人身保护，请法官派出两个看守站在我们中间，把我们隔开。判决书一定，他判了七年徒刑，而我有十四年。他仅仅七年，法官还对他感到惋惜，因为他本该是一个不错的人，至于我，在法官的眼里，是一个惯犯，而且性格暴烈，所以每况愈下。”\n 他越讲越表现出极大的激动，却尽量地控制住自己，急促地呼吸了两三口气，也吞进了几口唾液，然后向我伸出他的手，用一种保证似的态度对我说：“亲爱的孩子，我不会再粗野不文明的。”\n 他激动得热气腾腾，急忙掏出手帕擦他的面孔，擦他的额角，擦他的脖子和手，然后才又继续讲下去。\n “我对康佩生说过，我要砸碎他的面孔，我自己也发誓，不砸碎他的面孔，就让老天砸烂我的面孔。我们关在同一条监狱船上，但长期中我近不了他身，努力也无用。后来遇上了一个机会，我跟在他后面，朝他脸蛋上狠狠打了一拳，等他转过脸来又一拳送过去，不巧被看到了。我被他们逮住，关进了船上的黑牢房，对于会游泳和会潜水的人来讲，黑牢房不起作用，而且又不坚固。所以我乘机逃到了岸上，躲在坟墓之间。我正在羡慕赞叹着那些故人，因为一死什么都结束了，就这个当儿我见到了你，我的孩子！”\n 他这时怀着深情厚谊地对我望了一眼，本来我对他已产生了较大的同情，但经他这一望，对他的厌恶情绪又回到了心上。\n “我的孩子，那时通过你的话我知道康佩生也到了沼泽地上。根据我的看法，我一半认为他逃出来是因为对我的恐惧，不过他并不晓得我那时已到达了岸上。我四处找他，终于找到了。我砸烂了他的面孔，又对他说：‘现在不管自己会怎么样，我也要挺而走险，把你拖回水牢船。’要是后来不发生士兵来的事，我就会拖着他的头发游回到水牢船上，我这一手弄他上船是不需要士兵帮忙的。\n “自然，这件事最后又是他讨了便宜，因为他的品质原来是好的。他为什么逃跑？因为我打他，有谋杀他的心，所以他被逼得半疯了，所以对他的惩治是轻的。我则被戴上了手铐脚镣，重新审判，判成终身流放。亲爱的孩子和皮普的朋友，现在我回来了，也就无所谓终身流放了。”\n 他又讲得热气腾腾，取出手帕擦脸擦手，和刚才一样。然后，他从口袋中慢慢地掏出一团烟草，从钮扣洞里抽出烟斗，缓慢地把烟丝填进去，开始拍起烟来。\n “他死了吗？”沉默了片刻我问道。\n “亲爱的孩子，你说谁死了？”\n “康佩生。”\n “他要是活着，就会希望我死，这是肯定的，”他眼中闪着凶狠的目光说道，“我后来就再没有听过他的消息。”\n 赫伯特拿起铅笔在一本书的封面内页上写了些字，又轻轻地把这本书递给了我，这时普鲁威斯正站在那里抽烟，两眼注意着火炉，我便读着他写的字：\n “郝维仙小姐的弟弟叫亚瑟，康佩生就是当年假作赫维仙小姐情人的那个家伙。”\n 我合上书，对赫伯特微微点了点头，便把书放在一边。我们谁也没有讲话，都凝视着站在炉边抽烟的普鲁威斯。\n \n
