{"id":35073,"no":51,"title":"Chapter 51","content":"Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard-street that night. Herbert\u0027s representations that if I did, I should probably be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive\u0027s safety would depend upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding, again and again reiterated, that come what would, I was to go to Mr Jaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out together, and at the corner of Giltspur-street by Smithfield, I left Herbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain. There were periodical occasions when Mr Jaggers and Wemmick went over the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things straight. On these occasions Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr Jaggers\u0027s room, and one of the up-stairs clerks came down into the outer office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick\u0027s post that morning, I knew what was going on; but, I was not sorry to have Mr Jaggers and Wemmick together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to compromise him. My appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders, favoured my object. Although I had sent Mr Jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence, than it had been before. While I described the disaster, Mr Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire. Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the pockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post. The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn\u0027t smell fire at the present moment. My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced Miss Havisham\u0027s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for Herbert. Mr Jaggers\u0027s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick, with instructions to draw the cheque for his signature. While that was in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked on at me. `I am sorry, Pip,\u0027 said he, as I put the cheque in my pocket, when he had signed it, `that we do nothing for you.\u0027 `Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,\u0027 I returned, `whether she could do nothing for me, and I told her No.\u0027 `Everybody should know his own business,\u0027 said Mr Jaggers. And I saw Wemmick\u0027s lips form the words `portable property.\u0027 `I should not have told her No, if I had been you,\u0027 said Mr Jaggers; `but every man ought to know his own business best.\u0027 `Every man\u0027s business,\u0027 said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me, `is portable property.\u0027 As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at heart, I said, turning on Mr Jaggers: `I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave me all she possessed.\u0027 `Did she?\u0027 said Mr Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and then straightening himself. `Hah! I don\u0027t think I should have done so, if I had been Miss Havisham. But she ought to know her own business best.\u0027 `I know more of the history of Miss Havisham\u0027s adopted child, than Miss Havisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.\u0027 Mr Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated `Mother?\u0027 `I have seen her mother within these three days.\u0027 `Yes?\u0027 said Mr Jaggers. `And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.\u0027 `Yes?\u0027 said Mr Jaggers. `Perhaps I know more of Estella\u0027s history than even you do,\u0027 said I. `I know her father too.\u0027 A certain stop that Mr Jaggers came to in his manner - he was too self-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stop - assured me that he did not know who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis\u0027s account (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark; which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr Jaggers\u0027s client until some four years later, and when he could have no reason for claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this unconsciousness on Mr Jaggers\u0027s part before, though I was quite sure of it now. `So! You know the young lady\u0027s father, Pip?\u0027 said Mr Jaggers. `Yes,\u0027 I replied, `and his name is Provis - from New South Wales.\u0027 Even Mr Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the soonest checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the action of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the announcement I am unable to say, for I was afraid to look at him just then, lest Mr Jaggers\u0027s sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us. `And on what evidence, Pip,\u0027 asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, `does Provis make this claim?\u0027 `He does not make it,\u0027 said I, `and has never made it, and has no knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.\u0027 For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so unexpected that Mr Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket without completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face. Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor, did I look towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for some time silently meeting Mr Jaggers\u0027s look. When I did at last turn my eyes in Wemmick\u0027s direction, I found that he had unposted his pen, and was intent upon the table before him. `Hah!\u0027 said Mr Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the table, ` - What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?\u0027 But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a passionate, almost an indignant, appeal to him to be more frank and manly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said that I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted assurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long, and that, although I had lost her and must live a bereaved life, whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world. And seeing that Mr Jaggers stood quite still and silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to Wemmick, and said, `Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the innocent cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr Jaggers, and to represent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be more open with me!\u0027 I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment; but, it melted as I saw Mr Jaggers relax into something like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder. `What\u0027s all this?\u0027 said Mr Jaggers. `You with an old father, and you with pleasant and playful ways?\u0027 `Well!\u0027 returned Wemmick. `If I don\u0027t bring \u0027em here, what does it matter?\u0027 `Pip,\u0027 said Mr Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling openly, `this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.\u0027 `Not a bit of it,\u0027 returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. `I think you\u0027re another.\u0027 Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking him in. `You with a pleasant home?\u0027 said Mr Jaggers. `Since it don\u0027t interfere with business,\u0027 returned Wemmick, `let it be so. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn\u0027t wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own, one of these days, when you\u0027re tired of all this work.\u0027 Mr Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and actually drew a sigh. `Pip,\u0027 said he, `we won\u0027t talk about \"poor dreams;\" you know more about such things than I, having much fresher experience of that kind. But now, about this other matter. I\u0027ll put a case to you. Mind! I admit nothing.\u0027 He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly said that he admitted nothing. `Now, Pip,\u0027 said Mr Jaggers, `put this case. Put the case that a woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to the latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put the case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.\u0027 `I follow you, sir.\u0027 `Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he saw of children, was, their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported, neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing up to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life, he had reason to look upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his net - to be prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.\u0027 `I follow you, sir.\u0027 `Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the heap, who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this power: \"I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so, this was your manner of attack and this the manner of resistance, you went so and so, you did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you through it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring you off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost, your child is still saved.\" Put the case that this was done, and that the woman was cleared.\u0027 `I understand you perfectly.\u0027 `But that I make no admissions?\u0027 `That you make no admissions.\u0027 And Wemmick repeated, `No admissions.\u0027 `Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the woman\u0027s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty, she was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be sheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the old wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend the imaginary case?\u0027 `Quite.\u0027 `Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That the mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the mother and father unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many miles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was still a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case to yourself very carefully.\u0027 `I do.\u0027 `I ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully.\u0027 And Wemmick said, `I do.\u0027 `For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father\u0027s? I think he would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother\u0027s? I think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. For the daughter\u0027s? I think it would hardly serve her, to establish her parentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for life. But, add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her the subject of those \"poor dreams\" which have, at one time or another, been in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you that you had better - and would much sooner when you had thought well of it - chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut that off, too.\u0027 I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his lips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr Jaggers did the same. `Now, Wemmick,\u0027 said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, `what item was it you were at, when Mr Pip came in?\u0027 Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one another; Mr Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they got on very well indeed together. But, they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or in that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble (which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shop-lifting. As he imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike\u0027s eye happened to twinkle with a tear. `What are you about?\u0027 demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation. `What do you come snivelling here for?\u0027 `I didn\u0027t go to do it, Mr Wemmick.\u0027 `You did,\u0027 said Wemmick. `How dare you? You\u0027re not in a fit state to come here, if you can\u0027t come here without spluttering like a bad pen. What do you mean by it?\u0027 `A man can\u0027t help his feelings, Mr Wemmick,\u0027 pleaded Mike. `His what?\u0027 demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. `Say that again!\u0027 `Now, look here my man,\u0027 said Mr Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing to the door. `Get out of this office. I\u0027ll have no feelings here. Get out.\u0027 `It serves you right,\u0027 said Wemmick, `Get out.\u0027 So the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr Jaggers and Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch. 我如此满怀热情地追查并证明埃斯苔娜父亲的身份，究竟是抱着什么目的，我自己也说不清。但不久你们就会明白，等到有一个比我更为智慧的人指明问题之后，这个问题在我心里才有了一个清楚的轮廓。 但是，赫伯特和我作了这次具有重要意义的谈话之后，我就怀着满腔的热情与信心，一定要把事情搞个水落石出，而且要趁热打铁，刨根问底。我得去看一下贾格斯先生，从他那里得到事实的真情。我这样做究竟是为了埃斯苔娜的缘故，还是为了那个我极其关心并要进行保护的人，想让他也了解这么长时间以来和她有关的罗曼蒂克的迷团，我也不知道。也许第二种可能更接近于事实吧。 当时我难以抑制住自己的心情，当夜就想要到吉拉德街去。赫伯特劝我说，要是我这般着急地去，我就可能病上加病，身心交瘁，何况那个逃犯的安全都要依靠我，我只有耐心行事，不能急躁。我明白其道理之后，他又反复地对我说，不管怎样，明天我再去贾格斯先生那里也不晚。我这才收心，保持心中的平静，一方面由他为我疗伤，另一方面安心地待在家中。第二天一早我们一起出发，在吉尔茨普街和史密斯菲广场的拐角处分了手，他向城里走去，我则转向小不列颠街。 贾格斯先生和温米克先生每隔一个阶段就要对律师事务所里的账目进行一次清理，核对各种单据，把账目整理清楚。每逢结账时期，温米克便带着账簿和票据到贾格斯先生的办公室里去，同时楼上的办事员中就有一个下来，坐在外间办公室里办公。这天早晨我看到楼上的一位办事员坐在温米克的座位上，便知道他们在结账。贾格斯先生和温米克在一起，我并不感到有什么不方便，这也可以让温米克听一听我和贾格斯先生的谈话，而且我的话一句都不会连累到他。 我的胳膊上吊了绷带，大衣松松地披在肩头，就是这样，我出现在他们的面前。虽然昨天我一抵达伦敦，便寄给贾格斯先生一封短信，告诉了他发生的这次事故，但现在我得向他详详细细叙述始末。这样的描述倒使我们的谈话既不干巴巴，又不那么生硬，更不像以前那样每句话都要有凭证。在我叙述这次事故时，贾格斯先生还是老习惯，站在壁炉之前听我讲。温米克则背靠在椅子上，瞪着我，双手插在他的裤袋中，一支笔横插在他那张邮筒式的嘴巴之中。那两个蛮横的头像在我心里老是想插手事务所的事，现在也似乎满脸火气一般，在考虑着现在他们是否闻到了火的味道呢。 我的叙述完了，他们的问题也提完了，我这才把郝维仙小姐那个凭证交给他们，领取给赫伯特的九百英镑。在我把象牙簿递给贾格斯先生时，他的双眼又向深眼窝中缩进去了一些，但他立刻就把簿子递给了温米克，让温米克开支票让他签字。温米克在开支票时，我看着他写，而贾格斯先生也看着我。他脚登擦得很亮的皮靴子，抖动着双腿，同时保持着自己的平衡。“皮普，真遗憾，”他在支票上签好字后递给我，我把支票放进我的口袋，这时他说道，“我们没有为你做些什么。” 我答道：“郝维仙小姐也善意地问过我，她是不是也帮我点什么，我感谢她的好意，说不用了。” “每个人应当了解自己的事情。”贾格斯先生说道，同时我看到温米克的嘴唇形成了“动产”的字样。 “假如我是你，我就不会对她说‘不’这个字，”贾格斯先生说道，“不过，每个人都最了解自己的事。” 温米克带了责备的口气对我说道：“每个人最休戚相关的事就是‘动产’。 我想现在是该提出问题的时候了，这个问题一直深藏在我的内心，于是我对着贾格斯先生说道： “先生，我确实也向郝维仙小姐提出过一个问题，请她告诉我关于她领养的女儿的一些情况，她把她所知道的全部告诉了我。” “她真的告诉了你？”贾格斯先生把上身弯下来看着他的皮鞋，然后又直起身体，说道，“哈！假如我是郝维仙小姐，我想是没有必要全部告诉你的。不过，每个人的事自己最了解。” “先生，对于郝维仙小姐领养女儿的情况，我比郝维仙小姐本人了解得更清楚。连她的母亲是谁我都知道。” 贾格斯先生探询性地望着我，又重复了我的话：“连她的母亲是谁都知道？” “就在三天前我还见到过她的母亲。” “是吗？”贾格斯先生说道。 “先生，其实你也见到的，就在最近你还见到她的。” “是吗？”贾格斯先生又反问道。 “也许我对埃斯苔娜身世的了解比你知道得还要多呢，”我说道，“我还认识她的父亲。” 贾格斯先生听了我的话，神色之间略略表现出吃惊的样子，但是他很稳重，一点也不慌张；不过无论如何他还是表现出了一点凝神注意的样子，就从这些我可以断定他并不知道谁是她的父亲。昨天晚上赫伯特叙述了普鲁威斯的话，说他避开任何人时，我就怀疑到这一点。因为当初普鲁威斯还不是贾格斯先生的客户，四年左右之后他才来找贾格斯先生为他办事，而且他也不需要向他供出自己的身份。这之前我还没有把握说贾格斯先生不了解其中情由，而现在我已经十分有把握了。 “皮普，那么你认识这位年轻女士的父亲喽，是吗？”贾格斯先生说道。 “是的，”我答道，“他的名字就是普鲁威斯，是新南威尔士的普鲁威斯。” 我说到这些话时，只见贾格斯先生也惊了一下。这只是轻微的一惊，并不容易被觉察出来；他极力地掩饰自己的吃惊，而且马上就消失了痕迹。但是，不管他怎么样掩饰自己，甚至掏出手帕来掩饰自己，他确实是吃了一惊。至于温米克在听了我的话后是什么反应，我无法说出，因为我尽量不去注视他，以免让贾格斯先生用他那犀利的眼光从中看出破绽，发现我们之间有什么尚未公开的来往。 贾格斯先生想用他的手帕捂住鼻子，手在半路上时却停住了，非常冷静地问道：“皮普，普鲁威斯有什么证据来证明这个事实呢？” “他没有提到这个问题，”我说道，“他根本没有提到过这个问题，他一点不知道自己的女儿还活在人间，也不敢相信她活着。” 这一次，他那块有重大作用的手帕不起作用了。我的回答太突如其来了，贾格斯先生的手帕没有完成通常的表演效果。他把手帕放回到口袋，两条臂膀交叉在一起，非常严肃地注视着我，脸上却一点也不动声色。 接着我就把我知道的一切都告诉他，还告诉了他我是怎样获知的。当然我也很注意，虽然有些事我是从温米克处听来的，我都说是郝维仙小姐告诉我的。所有这些我都是非常小心谨慎的。一直等我说完了我该说的话，并且和贾格斯先生的目光默默相对了一会儿后，我才把眼光转向温米克的方向，这之前我没有看他一眼。此时我发现温米克已经拿开他邮筒式的嘴里的那支笔，正凝神地望着他前面的桌子。 “嗨！”贾格斯先生终于说道，他移步到放着票据的桌子旁边，“温米克，皮普先生来的时候，你核对到哪一笔账目啦？” 但是我不甘心就这样被他们置之不理，这时我的心情激动起来，甚至有些愤慨，我要贾格斯先生心怀坦白些，对我要豪爽些。我提醒他要注意我曾经徒然地怀抱着多少希望，它们在我的内心深藏了多么久，而现在终于发现并不是这么回事。我向他暗示自己随时会有危险，这使我灵魂焦虑不安。我向他表明，我对他无比信赖，没有任何东西向他隐瞒，希望他应像我信任他那样地信任我。我说，我没有责备过他，我没有怀疑过他，我没有不信任过他，但是我要从他那里得到事物的真相。如果他问我，我为什么要得到事物的真相，为什么我有权利来获得事物的真相，我会对他说，虽然他并不关心我所做的这可怜的梦，但我那么真诚地爱着埃斯苔娜，爱得那么长久，却失去了她，只留下一人孤独地了此余生，所以，即使现在，凡关于她的事情对我来说，都比这世界上的其他事情更贴近，更亲切。我发现贾格斯先生仍然若无其事地站在那里，一点声色不动，看来他是顽固不化，对我的请求无动于衷，于是便转身对着温米克说道：“温米克，我知道你是一位大丈夫，心胸开阔、温和。我有幸去过你快乐的府第，拜访过你的老父亲，知道你用那些天真无邪令人愉快的生活方式消度你从工作中带来的疲劳。我请求你帮我忙，向贾格斯先生讲真情，务必请他无论在什么情况下对我都该以实言相告。 我从来没有见到过有两个人的四目相对比贾格斯先生和温米克在听了我的强调之后相互对视得那么蹊跷。起先我真担心，看来温米克马上就会从他的事务所中被解雇，但过了一会儿，我看到贾格斯先生开始软化，甚至露出了微笑，温米克也显得胆子大了些，我的担心才消去。 贾格斯先生对温米克说道：“什么一位老父亲，什么天真无邪令人愉快的生活方式，这些都是怎么一回事？” “这个嘛！”温米克答道，“我不把这些带到这里来，那又有什么关系呢？” “皮普，”贾格斯先生把他的手放在我的手臂上，嘴也露出笑容，“这个人该是整个伦敦城里最狡猾的骗子了。” “那可一点儿也不是，”温米克的胆子越来越大，答道，“我看你倒是个骗子呢。” 他们两人又一次交换着和刚才一样古怪的眼神，各自对对方都怀着戒心，唯恐自己上当。 “你有一个愉快的家庭？”贾格斯先生对他说道。 “愉快的家庭和事务所办公没有关系，”温米克答道，“那就不必问它。在我看来，先生，要是你在计划或筹备一个愉快的家，我也不会感到奇怪，一个人在干活干得厌倦后，安排一个自己的家没有什么奇怪的。” 贾格斯先生点了两三次头，似乎带有回忆往事般的神情，又叹了一口气。他说道：“皮普，我们没有必要谈什么‘可怜的梦’；对这些事情你知道得比我要多，你有更多的新鲜的亲身体验。不过现在，关于另一件事，我可以提供一个情况。请注意！我没有承认这是事实。” 说完后他便等着我表明心意，说我完全了解他的意思，他没有承认是事实。 然后贾格斯先生说道：“皮普，比如有这么一种情况，有一个女人，其情况和你刚才所说的差不多，她把自己的孩子藏了起来，可是又不得不把事实告诉她的法律顾问，因为法律顾问代表她的利益，必须了解孩子的真情，才能展开他的辩护，预计辩护的成功性。在这个情况发生的同时，有一位性格古怪却很有钱的妇女又委托这位法律顾问找一个孩子，她想领养这孩子并培养成人。” “我明白你的意思，先生。” “假使情况是这样，这个法律顾问生活于一处罪恶的环境之中，他看到孩子们成批成批地出生，又成批成批地走向毁灭。这位法律顾问时常看到孩子们在刑事法庭上受到严厉的审问；他非常了解这些孩子会被关进监狱，被鞭打，被送去流放，再没有人过问，遭到抛弃，总之，会通过各种各样的途径被送到绞刑官手中，等他们长成人后便上绞刑架。这些都司空见惯的。再说这个情况吧，他把他每天在律师事务中所见到的所有的孩子看成是鱼卵，他这样看待他们是有理由的：鱼卵都会长成鱼，都会被捕进鱼网，也就是说这些孩子会受到起诉，会找律师辩护，会被父母舍弃，会变成孤儿，总之，会堕入魔窟。” “我明白你的意思，先生。” “皮普，比如有一种情况，在一堆可以挽救的孩子当中有一个可爱的小女孩，父亲以为这孩子已经死了，不敢大闹大嚷；至于母亲呢，这个法律顾问却有权力控制住她。他对她说：‘我知道你干过什么，我知道你是怎么干的，你到过诸如此类的地方，你为了逃避嫌疑做了如此这般的安排。我对你的一切调查得了如指掌，每一件事都能说得一清二楚。你得和这个孩子分开，但如果为了洗刷罪名非得孩子作证，那当是另当别论的。你把孩子给我，我尽最大的努力使你脱险。如果你得救，你的孩子自然平安无事；万一你出事了，而你的孩子也仍然能平安无事。’情况就是这样，那个女人也就照此做了，并且这个女人也被无罪释放。” “我完全懂得你所说的意思。” “但是我并没有肯定什么。” “你没有肯定什么。” 温米克也重复了这个意思：“没有肯定。” “再说这情况，皮普，情感上的痛苦和死亡的恐怖使这个妇女的精神受到打击而有失常态。在她恢复自由之后，她竟然时时如惊弓之鸟，和世俗常情不合，于是便求助于她的法律顾问给她一个安身之处。假如情况是这个法律顾问答应了她，收容了她。每逢他看到她一有可能发作旧病的形迹，他便使用老办法控制住她，压下她那狂暴的性格，你能不能了解这一假设推理呢？” “我完全能了解。” “再说这情况的可能性，这个孩子长大了，为了金钱而出嫁。她的母亲仍旧活在人间，她的父亲也还活在人间。她的父母两人互不来往，互无音信，虽然住在几英里之内，或者几百码之隔，或者咫尺之远，随你怎么说都可以，秘密终究是秘密，你所获得的只是一丝风声。我说的这最后一点情况你可得三思。” “多谢关照。” “我同时也请温米克三思。” 温米克答道：“多谢关照。” “如果把这个秘密泄露出去，究竟对谁有益呢？难道是为了那个当父亲的？我看他知道了孩子母亲的下落不见得比现在的情况更好。难道是为那位当母亲的？我看她既然干出了那种事，她还是住在原处不动更安全。难道是为了那位当女儿的？我看这对她更糟，她的丈夫知道了她双亲的情况，倒叫她丢脸现丑，虽然逃避了二十年，还是保不了一生的平安无事。再说说情况的可能性吧，皮普。你曾经爱过她，你使她成为你‘可怜的梦’中的主角，其实前前后后她不知道成为多少人心里的偶像，多得连你也想不到。所以我要奉劝你，你最好（其实你一想通你自己也立即会愿意）用你那条扎了绷带的右手砍掉你扎着绷带的左手，然后再把斧头交给温米克，让他把你的右手再砍下来。” 我望着温米克，他的面容显得很严肃。他伸出食指严肃地碰了一下嘴唇，我也用食指碰了一下嘴唇。贾格斯先生也同样用食指碰了一下嘴唇，然后就恢复了常态，说道：“温米克，皮普先生进来的时候，你核对到哪一笔账目了？” 他们两人在核对账目时，我站在一旁观看。我看到他们用前面那种古怪目光，又相互对峙了好几次；如果有点和刚才不同，那就是他们各自似乎都在猜疑（就不说觉察到吧），他们自己向对方暴露出了某些弱点。我想，正因此，他们才各执己见，互不相让。贾格斯先生表现出高傲和专横，温米克显得顽强、固执，遇到再小的事情也会停下来争吵片刻。过去他们总是相处甚佳，今天却反目无常，斤斤计较，这种现象我从未见到过。 不过，他们两人的僵持局面由于迈克的出现解了围。迈克这个人就是我第一次来到这里时所遇到的那个客户，头上戴了顶皮帽子，有个用袖子擦鼻子的老习惯。迈克这个人本人或者他家庭中的成员总是出麻烦事，所谓麻烦事，就是指进了新门监狱。他这次来是诉说他的长女因为在店中行窃的嫌疑进了新门监狱。他忧忧怨怨一五一十地告诉了温米克，而贾格斯先生站在壁炉前，威严无比，对他的诉说毫不注意。迈克说话的同时，眼中显露出一颗晶莹的泪珠。 “你究竟来干什么？”温米克用非常愤怒的口吻对他说道，“你淌着眼泪来到这里究竟干什么？” “温米克先生，我这是没法儿。” “你是装出来的，”温米克说道，“你怎么敢装蒜？你要是总像一支坏钢笔那样不断溅出眼泪，你就不必到这里来。你哭哭啼啼究竟是干什么？” “人总是不得不流露出感情的，温米克先生。”迈克申辩似的恳求道。 “你说什么？”温米克这时也凶神恶煞似的问道，“你再说一遍！” “喂，你听着，”这时贾格斯先生向前走了一步，指着门说道，“你就从这个事务所滚出去。我们这里是不讲感情的，滚出去！” “自找苦吃，”温米克说道，“快滚。” 于是这个不幸的迈克只有低三下四地退了出去。这时贾格斯先生和温米克好像重建了友好，相互谅解了。他们重振精神，继续核对账目，仿佛刚刚吃了一顿称心如意的午餐。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/78/4559.html","bookId":540,"book":{"id":540,"title":"Great
