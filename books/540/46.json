{"id":35068,"no":46,"title":"Chapter 46","content":"Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank, a house with a wooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is another thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there, Mrs Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was immediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into the parlour and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at the corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the chimney-piece, and the coloured engravings on the wall, representing the death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George the Third in a state-coachman\u0027s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the terrace at Windsor.\n `All is well, Handel,\u0027 said Herbert, `and he is quite satisfied, though eager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you\u0027ll wait till she comes down, I\u0027ll make you known to her, and then we\u0027ll go up-stairs. - That\u0027s her father.\u0027\n I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance.\n `I am afraid he is a sad old rascal,\u0027 said Herbert, smiling, `but I have never seen him. Don\u0027t you smell rum? He is always as it.\u0027\n `At rum?\u0027 said I.\n `Yes,\u0027 returned Herbert, `and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his room, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and will weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler\u0027s shop.\u0027\n While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and then died away.\n `What else can be the consequence,\u0027 said Herbert, in explanation, `if he will cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand - and everywhere else - can\u0027t expect to get through a Double Gloucester without hurting himself.\u0027\n He seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious roar.\n `To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs Whimple,\u0027 said Herbert, `for of course people in general won\u0027t stand that noise. A curious place, Handel; isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.\n `Mrs Whimple,\u0027 said Herbert, when I told him so, `is the best of housewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.\u0027\n `Surely that\u0027s not his name, Herbert?\u0027\n `No, no,\u0027 said Herbert, `that\u0027s my name for him. His name is Mr Barley. But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother, to love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself, or anybody else, about her family!\u0027\n Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home to nurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the motherly Mrs Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser\u0027s stores.\n As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley\u0027s sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door opened, and a very pretty slight dark-eyed girl of twenty or so, came in with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the basket, and presented blushing, as `Clara.\u0027 She really was a most charming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.\n `Look here,\u0027 said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate and tender smile after we had talked a little; `here\u0027s poor Clara\u0027s supper, served out every night. Here\u0027s her allowance of bread, and here\u0027s her slice of cheese, and here\u0027s her rum - which I drink. This is Mr Barley\u0027s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two mutton chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It\u0027s stewed up together, and taken hot, and it\u0027s a nice thing for the gout, I should think!\u0027\n There was something so natural and winning in Clara\u0027s resigned way of looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out, - and something so confiding, loving, and innocent, in her modest manner of yielding herself to Herbert\u0027s embracing arm - and something so gentle in her, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks\u0027s Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-Walk, with Old Barley growing in the beam - that I would not have undone the engagement between her and Herbert, for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.\n I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come to us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert, `Papa wants me, darling!\u0027 and ran away.\n `There is an unconscionable old shark for you!\u0027 said Herbert. `What do you suppose he wants now, Handel!?\u0027\n `I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said I. `Something to drink?\u0027\n `That\u0027s it!\u0027 cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary merit. `He keeps his grog ready-mixed in a little tub on the table. Wait a moment, and you\u0027ll hear Clara lift him up to take some. - There he goes!\u0027 Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. `Now,\u0027 said Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, `he\u0027s drinking. Now,\u0027 said Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, `he\u0027s down again on his back!\u0027\n Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me up-stairs to see our charge. As we passed Mr Barley\u0027s door, he was heard hoarsely muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the following Refrain; in which I substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse.\n `Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here\u0027s old Bill Barley. Here\u0027s old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Here\u0027s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the Lord. Lying on the flat of his back, like a drifting old dead flounder, here\u0027s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy!Bless you.\u0027\n In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley would commune with himself by the day and night together; often while it was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.\n In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and airy, and in which Mr Barley was less audible than below, I found Provis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was softened - indefinably, for I could have said how, and could never afterwards recall how when I tried; but certainly.\n The opportunity that the day\u0027s rest had given me for reflection, had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting Compeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his fire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick\u0027s judgment and sources of information?\n `Ay, ay, dear boy!\u0027 he answered, with a grave nod, `Jaggers knows.\u0027\n `Then, I have talked with Wemmick,\u0027 said I, `and have come to tell you what caution he gave me and what advice.\u0027\n This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told him how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or prisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that my chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping close for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had said about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time came, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might be safest in Wemmick\u0027s judgment. What was to follow that, I did not touch upon; neither indeed was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in declared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living, by enlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?\n He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His coming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a venture. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help.\n Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick\u0027s suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. `We are both good watermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no boatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance is worth saving. Never mind the season; don\u0027t you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into that habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times, and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or fifty-first.\u0027\n I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed that it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never recognize us if we came below Bridge and rowed past Mill Pond Bank. But, we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was right.\n Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go; remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and that I would take half an hour\u0027s start of him. `I don\u0027t like to leave you here,\u0027 I said to Provis, `though I cannot doubt your being safer here than near me. Good-bye!\u0027\n `Dear boy,\u0027 he answered, clasping my hands, `I don\u0027t know when we may meet again, and I don\u0027t like Good-bye. Say Good Night!\u0027\n `Good night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time comes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, Good night!\u0027\n We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms, and we left him on the landing outside his door, holding a light over the stair-rail to light us down stairs. Looking back at him, I thought of the first night of his return when our positions were reversed, and when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now.\n Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name of Provis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr Campbell. He also explained that the utmost known of Mr Campbell there, was, that he (Herbert) had Mr Campbell consigned to him, and felt a strong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a secluded life. So, when we went into the parlour where Mrs Whimple and Clara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr Campbell, but kept it to myself.\n When I had taken leave of the pretty gentle dark-eyed girl, and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-Walk had grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the hills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks\u0027s Basin to fill it to overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and went home very sadly.\n All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The windows of the rooms of that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark and still, and there was no lounger in Garden-court. I walked past the fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between me and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert coming to my bedside when he came in - for I went straight to bed, dispirited and fatigued - made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that, he looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was a solemnly empty as the pavement of any Cathedral at that same hour.\n Next day, I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been out a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the hours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But I knew well enough how to `shoot\u0027 the bridge after seeing it done, and so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.\n In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Clara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going swiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.\n \n 时钟刚敲八时，我走进一处地方，空气中散发着锯木屑和刨花的气味，倒并不难闻，原来气味都是从长长河岸上的许多制造小船、船桅、船桨以及刹车的作坊中散发出的。泰晤士河伦敦桥的东岸蒲耳地区上上下下是一片水网地带，我对它是一点也不熟悉。我沿河而下，发现我所要找的地方并不是我原先设想的地方，实在很不容易找。这个地名是凹湾磨坊河滨。我不知道四湾怎么去，但我知道有一条老青铜制索走道通向那里。那儿是一片干燥的船坞，堆着许许多多船只准备修理，而我就在其中迷失了方向。这边放着许多的船壳，准备一件件一片片拆开，那儿堆着由海浪冲来的污泥、粘土、垃圾，到处是造新船、拆旧船的地方，一些生锈的铁锚一头插在地上，多少年未发挥用处了，还有乱七八糟的木桶、木材，堆得像一座小山。那里有许多制索走道，就是没有老青铜制索走道。我几次找来找去都扑了空，却踏破铁鞋无觅处，得来全不费功夫，一转拐角突然发现已到了磨坊河滨。这个地方从环境来看，是个空气清新的所在，河上吹来的清风在这里旋转着，其间还立着两三株树，遗留下一架已毁坏的风车残迹。这里就是老青铜制索走道，在月光下我尚能欣赏这又长又狭的夜景，一系列的木质船架都陷在地里，顺着船架走去，它们就像一些年代已久的干草耙子，不仅又老又朽，而且连耙齿都掉得差不多了。\n 在磨坊河滨上有几幢奇形怪状的房子，我发现其中有一幢建筑，前面有木门，带有罗汉肚窗的三层楼（这不是带棱角的窗子，而是另一种形式的）。我看到门上有牌子，写着蕴普尔夫人的字样。这正是我要找的屋子，于是我便上前敲门。一位稍年长的妇女应声而来，面容上和颜悦色，外表上雍容华贵。她开了门后便立刻退去，代之而出的是赫伯特，他悄悄把我领到客厅，随手把门关上。我看到他这张熟悉的面孔出现在这个很不熟悉的房间里，在这个很不熟悉的地方，而他竟对这里十分了解，这真令我十分奇怪。我一会儿望着他，一会儿望着放在角落里的橱子，里面放着杯子和瓷器，望着放在壁炉架上的贝壳，还有挂在墙上的彩色雕刻，一幅是柯克船长之死，一幅是新船下水，还有一幅是乔治三世国王陛下，戴着马车夫式的假发，身着皮短裤，脚登长统靴，站在温莎宫的阳台上。\n “汉德尔，一切都很顺利，”赫伯特说道，“他很满意，不过他渴望见到你。我亲爱的女友和她的父亲住在楼上，只要你等得及，她自会下来的，我介绍你认识她，然后我们到楼上去。——听，那就是她父亲。”\n 我这时听到楼上传出惊人的叫喊声，我的脸上大概表现出了惊讶的神色。\n “在我看来，他恐怕是一个糟透了的老坏蛋，”赫伯特微笑着说道，“不过我还没有见到过他。你问到朗姆酒的味道吗？他一天到晚和朗姆酒做伴。”\n “和朗姆酒做伴？”我说道。\n “是啊，”赫伯特答道，“你可以想一下，这朗姆酒怎么能缓减他的痛风病呢，可他还是坚持把吃喝的东西放在楼上自己的房间中，由他定时定量拿出来。他把这些东西放在头顶上的架子上，无论什么都要过秤。他的屋子就像一个杂货铺。”\n 他说这话时，上面传出来的吼叫变成了长长的怒吼，然后才趋于平静。\n 赫伯特又说道：“他偏要自己切乳酪，怎么能不得到这个结果呢？他的右手得了痛风病，其实他全身都有痛风病，又偏要自己切一块双层葛罗斯特乳酪，怎么能不伤到自己呢？”\n 现在他好像又割伤了自己，因为他又发出了一声猛烈的吼叫。\n “有像普鲁威斯这样的房客住在楼上真是老天赐给蕴普尔夫人的福气，”赫伯特说道，“因为常人一般都忍受不了这种吵闹。汉德尔，这是个奇怪的地方，对不对？”\n 这的确是个神秘奇怪的地方，不过这里倒收拾得整整齐齐、干干净净。\n 我把自己的想法告诉了赫伯特，他说道：“蕴普尔夫人是一位非常好的家庭主妇，我想要是我的克拉娜没有得到她像母亲般的慈爱关照，真不知道会怎么样。克拉娜早就失去了母亲，汉德尔，她在这个世界上孤零零无亲无故，要说有，就是这个凶狠暴怒的老父亲。”\n “赫伯特，他的名字可不会是凶狠暴怒吧？”\n “不，不是，”赫伯特说道，“这是我随便说说。他是巴莱先生。想想我父母有我这个儿子，竟然爱上了这位无亲无故的姑娘。她不需要为自己操心，也不需要别人来为她的家庭操心，这可不是我的福分吗？”\n 赫伯特现在一语提醒了我，其实他过去就已经告诉过我，他最初认识克拉娜·巴莱小姐的时候，正是她在汉莫史密斯的一所学校完成教育的那年，后来她便回到家里侍奉父亲。赫伯特和她向蕴普尔夫人吐露了他们二人的情感，蕴普尔夫人像母亲一样慈爱地关怀着他们。自从那时以来，蕴普尔夫人帮助他们培育了感情，对待他们既慈爱又照顾周到。可是，半点儿带有情感色彩的事都不能向巴莱老头儿吐露，他只知道自己的痛风病、喜欢喝的朗姆酒和航班事务长的储藏室，任何有点心理色彩的事他全然不考虑。\n 我们在楼下低声谈着话，而巴莱老头儿在楼上连声大叫，叫得使天花板上的横梁都震动起来。这时房门一开，一位十分秀丽的姑娘走了进来，身段苗条，两眼乌黑，年龄在二十岁上下，手上拎着一个篮子。赫伯特一见赶忙上前，柔情地接过篮子，脸上出现一道羞红，说这是克拉娜。她确是一位妩媚动人的姑娘，真像是一位仙女，可惜被巴莱老头这个残忍的食人魔鬼抓来，听他使唤。\n 我们谈了一会儿之后，赫伯特露出柔情怜爱的微笑，说道：“你看，这就是可怜的克拉娜的晚餐，每天晚上就给她这么点儿。这么一点儿面包，这么一片干酪，还有这么一点儿朗姆酒，不过酒都是我喝的。而这些却是巴莱先生明天的早餐，拿下来准备明火烧煮的：两块羊排骨。一堆去壳豌豆、一些面粉、两盎司黄油、一点儿盐，还有这些黑胡椒。这些东西混在一起煮，然后热腾腾地吃下去，我看这可真是治疗痛风病的好东西！”\n 克拉娜按着赫伯特指着的顺序用眼睛一样样地看着，那种神态不仅自然，而且迷人可爱。赫伯特用手臂搂着她的腰，她半带着羞容任他搂着，表现得那么诚挚，那么惹人爱怜，又那么纯真，显出一片温柔。然而，她竟住在凹湾的磨坊河滨，位于老青铜制索走道旁，陪伴着成天吼叫的巴莱老头，看来她多么需要保护啊！她和赫伯特之间的美满姻缘决不能拆散；为了他们我那尚未打开的皮夹里的钱都可以不要。\n 我正怀着愉快和羡慕的心情在欣赏着她时，突然楼上的吼声变成了乱跳乱叫，随着又响起了可怕的砰砰之声，仿佛有一个装着木腿的巨人正准备蹬破天花板，想从上面向我们扑下来。克拉娜一听到这声音便对赫伯特说道：“亲爱的，爸爸要我去！”说完便奔了出去。\n “这个没有良心、贪得无厌的老家伙！”赫伯特说道，“汉德尔，你猜他现在想要干什么？”\n “我说不清，”我说道，“也许想喝些什么吧？”\n “你猜中了！”赫伯特大声嚷道，仿佛我已经猜中了一件格外重要的事一样。“其实他的酒早就调制好了，放在桌上的一个小桶里。等一会儿，你就会听到克拉娜扶他起来喝酒的声音。听，他起来了2”一声吼叫响起，末尾拖着颤音。赫伯特说道：“现在，”吼声后是一片寂静，“他正在喝酒。”一会儿屋梁上又响起了吼叫声，赫伯特说道：“现在他又躺上了床。”\n 没有多久克拉娜回来了，于是赫伯特陪着我上楼去探望我们的被保护人。我们经过巴莱先生的房间时，听到他用嘶哑的声音哼着一首小调，忽高忽低地很像一阵风。我记下了这首小调，不过其中的意思我已经改了，改成了良好的祝愿。\n “喂，啊嗬！这里是比尔·巴莱老头，愿上帝保佑。这里是比尔·巴莱老头，愿上帝保佑。这里是比尔·巴莱老头，以主的名义，他正躺在床上。躺在床上，像一条已死去的漂在水上的老比目鱼。这就是你的比尔·巴莱老头，愿上帝保佑！喂，啊嗬，愿上帝保佑。”\n 赫伯特告诉我，这位你永远见不到的巴莱老头日日夜夜哼着这个曲调，并以此来自慰，一面自己想心思。只要天空有亮光，在一面哼一面自得其乐的时刻，他便会将一只眼睛对着设在床上的望远镜，方便自如地观赏河上的一派风光。\n 在这座屋子的顶屋有两个房间，空气流通，有一种新鲜感。住在里面和住在底层不同，这里不大听得到巴莱老头的狂呼怒吼。我看到普鲁威斯正舒舒服服地住在这里。他看到我并没有表现出惊奇，似乎没有感到有什么值得惊奇的地方。而我却感到他变温和了，当然我也说不清他怎么会变得温和了，以后我尽量回忆，都无法说清，总之，他确实是温和了。\n 白天的休息使我有了机会好好反省和思考，又使我有充分理由地决定，对普鲁威斯一字不提康佩生这个名字。因为我知道，他与这个人有不共戴天之仇，一提便会促使他出外寻找，甚至自己在粗鲁的行动中毁灭了自己。所以，赫怕特、我与他一起坐在火炉边时，我首先问他，是不是相信温米克的判断，相信他的消息来源？\n “噢，当然，亲爱的孩子！”他严肃地点着头，答道，“贾格斯不糊涂。”\n “我已经和温米克交谈过，”我说道，“我这次来是为了告诉你温米克提醒我注意的事，以及他的建议和忠告。”\n 我告诉他时是很有分寸的，当然刚才所说的康佩生这个名字是放在心里绝对不提的。我告诉他温米克在新门监狱听到人们的反映（究竟是管监狱的人的反映还是犯人们的反映，我就说不清了），说他已经受到怀疑，而且我所住的地方已在监视之中，因此，温米克建议他隐匿一个时期，而我也得和他分开。我告诉他，温米克还建议他到国外去，并且补充说，当然，时间一到我会同他一起出国，或者他先去，我会跟着去。这一切都要按照温米克的意见，要从安全着手。出国以后该怎么样，这一点我没有提到，一来我自己对这些事还没有理出头绪，心里不踏实；二来我看到他已变得温和起来，却为了我遇上了不可避免的危险。至于我改变生活方式以及过更为阔气的生活一事，我对他说，如今我们的处境既不安定，又随时会遇到艰险，如果再讲排场铺张浪费，不仅是荒唐可笑，而且会把事弄糟。\n 对于我说的一切他都不否认，而且从头至尾都是很讲情理的。他说他这次回来是冒险行为，实际上他早就知道这是一次冒险行为。当然，他说他不会不顾死活地去冒险，但他也不担心，有如此好的措施协助他，他会安全无事的。\n 赫伯特这时一直凝视着炉火，同时思考着。他也说温米克的建议对他有启发，他也想到了一个主意，不妨研究一下，也许是有价值的。“汉德尔，我们两个人都是优秀的划船手，一待时机成熟，我们自己就可以把他从这条河送出去。我们不需要雇船来完成这件事，也不需要雇船夫，至少这样做可以省去被人怀疑的麻烦，任何情况我们都需要防范到。至于是不是划船季节倒不用介意，你不妨去买一条船来，停在寺区的小码头旁，可以不时地沿河划来划去，你看这个办法好不好？一旦你养成了划船习惯，谁还会注意你呢？你划了二十次或者五十次，等你划到第二十一次或第五十一次的时候，人家是不会感到奇怪的。”\n 我非常喜欢这个计划，普鲁威斯也因此快乐得手舞足蹈。我们大家一致认为，这个计划应立刻开始施行。每逢我们划经桥下，划过磨坊河滨时，普鲁威斯千万不能和我们打招呼。我们又进一步达成一致，每次他看到我们的船经过时，如果平安无事，一切都好，他就把房子东边的百叶窗放下来。\n 我们的会议到此结束，每一件事都安排就绪，我便起身告辞了。我告诉赫伯特，我们两人最好不要同时回家，我先走半小时，他晚走半小时。我对普鲁威斯说：“我并不想把你一人留在这里，但我想你在这里一定比靠近我更为安全。再见！”\n “亲爱的孩子，”他伸出两手抓住我的双手紧握着，说道，“我们不知道什么时候才能再相见。我不喜欢用再见这个词，还是说一声晚安吧！”\n “晚安！赫伯特会来回于我们之间传达消息的，等待时机一成熟，我一定会准备好的，你放心好了。晚安，晚安！”\n 我们认为他最好留在房里，不必出外相送。我们走时他站在房外的楼梯口，高举着一支蜡烛照着我们走下楼梯。下楼时我又回眸望了他一眼，想到第一次他回来的情景，而现在我们的位置恰巧颠倒了一下。我真没有想到我此时和他相别，心头也会出现如此沉重和焦虑的情感。\n 在我们又一次经过巴莱老头的房门时，他还是咆哮着，诅咒着，看来他的乱叫还没有停止的征兆，也没有打算停下来。我们走到楼梯脚下，我问赫伯特他是否仍让他用普鲁威斯这个名字。他答道，当然不用，他住在这里用的是坎坡先生的名字。他还向我解释，这里的人只知道住在此地的坎坡先生是由他赫伯特抚养的，他赫伯特对此人有着强烈的个人责任，对他十分关心，让他过清静安稳的生活。我们走进客厅时，蕴普尔夫人和克拉娜正坐在那里干活儿。我是缄默守信，和她们没有提到我和坎坡先生之间的亲密关系。\n 我向这位可爱又温柔的黑眼睛姑娘告别，又向另一位长久以来以她诚恳的情意促成这一对小情侣的慈母般的妇女告别，这时候我感到仿佛老青铜制索走道也变了样，和我原来的印象大不相同了。这里的巴莱老头确是够老的了，而且他总是那样吼叫、骂人、诅咒，可是这样的环境中却充满了青春、真诚和希望的活力，也就使得四湾显得富有生命力了。我一路上又联想起埃斯苔娜，想到我和她分别时的情况，悲伤的情感充塞于心头，闷闷不乐地回到了家。\n 寺区像往常一样万籁俱寂，十分平静。原来普鲁威斯所住的几间房间的窗户现在显得那么黑暗，那么寂静。这时的花园里已没有闲逛的人了。在喷泉那里我来回走了两三次，然后才步下台阶，当时除了我孤独一人外，全无其他人影。我正灰心失望、身心疲倦，准备上床就寝时，赫伯特走到了我的床边，他也告诉我四下无人。然后，他开了一扇窗户，举目向外望去，外面是一片银色的月光。赫伯特告诉我，外面路上静悄悄空无一人，和大教堂旁的路上一样，此时都是静悄悄空无一人。\n 第二天，我便出去买一条船。这件事很快便办成了，我把船划到寺区的石埠码头前，从我家走到这里只需一两分钟的时间。以后我便开始划船练习，并不断地实践；有时我一人独划，有时和赫伯特一起。我时常在严寒雨雪的日子里出去划船，划了几次之后，人们也就不再注意我了。起先，我只在布莱克弗拉埃桥的上游划，后来在潮水变化的时候，我把船一直划到伦敦桥。当时的伦敦桥还是旧桥，桥下水流湍急，忽起忽落，十分危险，大家都不敢在桥下行驶。好在我看到过别人的船是如何“猛穿”老桥的，我也就掌握了其中的窍门，也敢于在桥下蒲耳区范围内的船只间穿行，一直划到埃利斯。第一次划过磨坊河滨时，赫伯特和我二人是用双桨划过去的；在划过去又划回来时，我们都看到普鲁威斯所住房屋的东边百叶窗都放了下来。赫伯特每个星期去那儿不会少于三次，每次回来带给我的消息都没有半点儿动静。不过我心里仍然是惊慌不安，因为我总有一个观念，认为我一直处在被人监视之中。我一旦有了这种看法，这种看法就像幽灵一样揪住我不放。我看到一个人就怀疑这个人在监视我，这样的人简直不可胜数。\n 总而言之，我一直充满了恐惧，担心在哪里隐藏着一个粗鲁的人。赫伯特有时告诉我，天黑之后，他站在我们住处的一个窗口，观望着潮水的退流，潮水回退而去，带着所有的东西都向克拉娜流去，令他内心感到无比的欢欣。而我的思想正相反，心中怀着无限的忧思，觉得河水是向马格韦契流去，只要河上出现任何一个黑点，就认为是追捕船，那么迅速地、悄悄地、肯定地会把他逮住。\n \n
