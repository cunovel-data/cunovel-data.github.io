{"id":35046,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my bedroom in Barnard\u0027s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my manners would be none the worse for Herbert\u0027s society. Mr Pocket did not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mr Jaggers. `If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,\u0027 said I, `and one or two other little things, I should be quite at home there.\u0027 `Go it!\u0027 said Mr Jaggers, with a short laugh. `I told you you\u0027d get on. Well! How much do you want?\u0027 I said I didn\u0027t know how much. `Come!\u0027 retorted Mr Jaggers. `How much? Fifty pounds?\u0027 `Oh, not nearly so much.\u0027 `Five pounds?\u0027 said Mr Jaggers. This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, `Oh! more than that.\u0027 `More than that, eh!\u0027 retorted Mr Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the wall behind me; `how much more?\u0027 `It is so difficult to fix a sum,\u0027 said I, hesitating. `Come!\u0027 said Mr Jaggers. `Let\u0027s get at it. Twice five; will that do? Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?\u0027 I said I thought that would do handsomely. `Four times five will do handsomely, will it?\u0027 said Mr Jaggers, knitting his brows. `Now, what do you make of four times five?\u0027 `What do I make of it?\u0027 `Ah!\u0027 said Mr Jaggers; `how much?\u0027 `I suppose you make it twenty pounds,\u0027 said I, smiling. `Never mind what I make it, my friend,\u0027 observed Mr Jaggers, with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head. `I want to know what you make it.\u0027 `Twenty pounds, of course.\u0027 `Wemmick!\u0027 said Mr Jaggers, opening his office door. `Take Mr Pip\u0027s written order, and pay him twenty pounds.\u0027 This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr Jaggers never laughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising himself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to creak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr Jaggers\u0027s manner. `Tell him that, and he\u0027ll take it as a compliment,\u0027 answered Wemmick; `he don\u0027t mean that you should know what to make of it. - Oh!\u0027 for I looked surprised, `it\u0027s not personal; it\u0027s professional: only professional.\u0027 Wemmick was at his desk, lunching - and crunching - on a dry hard biscuit; pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as if he were posting them. `Always seems to me,\u0027 said Wemmick, `as if he had set a mantrap and was watching it. Suddenly - click - you\u0027re caught!\u0027 Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life, I said I supposed he was very skilful? `Deep,\u0027 said Wemmick, `as Australia.\u0027 Pointing with his pen at the office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe. `If there was anything deeper,\u0027 added Wemmick, bringing his pen to paper, `he\u0027d be it.\u0027 Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said, `Ca-pi-tal!\u0027 Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he replied: `We don\u0027t run much into clerks, because there\u0027s only one Jaggers, and people won\u0027t have him at second-hand. There are only four of us. Would you like to see \u0027em? You are one of us, as I may say.\u0027 I accepted the offer. When Mr Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coat-collar like an iron pigtail, we went up-stairs. The house was dark and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr Jaggers\u0027s room, seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat-catcher - a large pale puffed swollen man - was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr Jaggers\u0027s coffers. `Getting evidence together,\u0027 said Mr Wemmick, as we came out, `for the Bailey.\u0027 In the room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair (his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt me anything I pleased - and who was in an excessive white-perspiration, as if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a high-shouldered man with a faceache tied up in dirty flannel, who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen, for Mr Jaggers\u0027s own use. This was all the establishment. When we went down-stairs again, Wemmick led me into my guardian\u0027s room, and said, `This you\u0027ve seen already.\u0027 `Pray,\u0027 said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again, `whose likenesses are those?\u0027 `These?\u0027 said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down. `These are two celebrated ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap (why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered his master, and, considering that he wasn\u0027t brought up to evidence, didn\u0027t plan it badly.\u0027 `Is it like him?\u0027 I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve. `Like him? It\u0027s himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate, directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me, hadn\u0027t you, Old Artful?\u0027 said Wemmick. He then explained this affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying, `Had it made for me, express!\u0027 `Is the lady anybody?\u0027 said I. `No,\u0027 returned Wemmick. `Only his game. (You liked your bit of game, didn\u0027t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr Pip, except one - and she wasn\u0027t of this slender ladylike sort, and you wouldn\u0027t have caught her looking after this urn - unless there was something to drink in it.\u0027 Wemmick\u0027s attention being thus directed to his brooch, he put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his pocket-handkerchief. `Did that other creature come to the same end?\u0027 I asked. `He has the same look.\u0027 `You\u0027re right,\u0027 said Wemmick; `it\u0027s the genuine look. Much as if one nostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fish-hook. Yes, he came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He forged wills, this blade did, if he didn\u0027t also put the supposed testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though\u0027 (Mr Wemmick was again apostrophizing), `and you said you could write Greek. Yah, Bounceable! What a liar you were!I never met such a liar as you!\u0027 Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said, `Sent out to buy it for me, only the day before.\u0027 While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair, the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewellery was derived from like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I ventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood before me, dusting his hands. `Oh yes,\u0027 he returned, `these are all gifts of that kind. One brings another, you see; that\u0027s the way of it. I always take \u0027em. They\u0027re curiosities. And they\u0027re property. They may not be worth much, but, after all, they\u0027re property and portable. It don\u0027t signify to you with your brilliant look-out, but as to myself, my guidingstar always is, \"Get hold of portable property\".\u0027 When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a friendly manner: `If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn\u0027t mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I should consider it an honour. I have not much to show you; but such two or three curiosities as I have got, you might like to look over; and I am fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.\u0027 I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality. `Thankee,\u0027 said he; `then we\u0027ll consider that it\u0027s to come off, when convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr Jaggers yet?\u0027 `Not yet.\u0027 `Well,\u0027 said Wemmick, `he\u0027ll give you wine, and good wine. I\u0027ll give you punch, and not bad punch. and now I\u0027ll tell you something. When you go to dine with Mr Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.\u0027 `Shall I see something very uncommon?\u0027 `Well,\u0027 said Wemmick, `you\u0027ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very uncommon, you\u0027ll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won\u0027t lower your opinion of Mr Jaggers\u0027s powers. Keep your eye on it.\u0027 I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr Jaggers `at it?\u0027 For several reasons, and not least because I didn\u0027t clearly know what Mr Jaggers would be found to be `at,\u0027 I replied in the affirmative. We dived into the City, and came up in a crowded policecourt, where a blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased with the fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross-examination - I don\u0027t know which - and was striking her, and the bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever degree, said a word that he didn\u0027t approve of, he instantly required to have it `taken down.\u0027 If anybody wouldn\u0027t make an admission, he said, `I\u0027ll have it out of you!\u0027 and if anybody made an admission, he said, `Now I have got you!\u0027 the magistrates shivered under a single bite of his finger. Thieves and thieftakers hung in dread rapture on his words, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction. Which side he was on, I couldn\u0027t make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and justice in that chair that day. 两三天之后，我已把自己的房间安置停当。我来来回回到伦敦市内去过几次，所需要的东西已向各有关商行订购，也都已经送来了。鄱凯特先生和我已作过一次长谈。他对于我未来的前途比我自己还清楚，他说贾格斯先生已经告诉他我的情况，所以我的学习不是为了寻求工作，而是接受教育，其教育的良好程度要和有钱人家子弟的一般情况差不多，以和我未来的命运相称。自然，对于这些我没有反对意见，也就是默认了。 他建议我先到伦敦几处地方去跑跑，可以获得一些我所缺乏的基本知识。现在他已受权在所有的功课方面对我进行讲解、指导。他希望他能够明智地帮助我，使我不至于遇到麻烦的问题。他相信要不了多久，我就完全可以由他一人指导学习了。说了这些之后，他又说了不少类似的话。他对我开门见山，以诚相待，措辞美妙，我立刻也向他表达了我的思想。既然他在履行合同时对我那么热情认真、诚实可靠，自然我在履行和他所定的合同时也会同样热情认真、诚实可靠。如果作为老师他对我表示冷漠，无疑作为学生，我也会运用冷漠回敬老师；他既然并未给我以口实，两人相互之间自也是各不相负。在教与学的过程之中，我感到在他身上没有一点荒唐可笑的地方，他给我的感觉是那么严肃认真、诚实可靠。慈祥善良。 有关学习方面的问题达成协议后，我便开始努力并付诸于实现。我又想到，假使我能在巴纳德旅馆保留一个房间，我的生活便会更加丰富多彩，再说，和赫伯特住在一起，在待人接物方面也会有所长进。鄱凯特先生并不反对这种安排，但他告诫我，在做任何事之前，都必须去请示一下我的监护人。我感到他考虑得十分周到，因为实现了这个计划也可为赫伯特节省点开支，于是我到了小不列颠街，把我的想法告诉贾格斯先生。 “假使我能够把租的一套家具买下来，”我对他说道，“再买上一两件别的小东西，我住在那里会是够舒服的了。” “去买！”贾格斯先生不高兴地笑了一声，“我早就告诉过你，你的费用会大起来的。现在怎么样，你要多少钱？” 我说我不知道要多少钱。 “说吧！”贾格斯先生紧逼道，“要多少？五十镑行吗？” “哦，用不着那么多。” “五镑怎么样？”贾格斯先生说道。 这真是从天上掉到了地下，我被弄得狼狈不堪。“哦，要比五镑多些！”我只得说道。 “比五镑多些，嗯！”贾格斯先生说道，在等我回答。他两手插在口袋中，头歪向一边，眼睛望着我背后的墙。“你究竟要多少？” “很难确准一个数字。”我感到踌躇地说道。 “得了，得了！”贾格斯先生说道，“让我们来算一下，两个五镑行不行？三个五镑行不行？四个五镑行不行？” 我说我想这个数目是足够了。 “四个五镑足够了，是不是？”贾格斯先生皱起眉头说道，“那么，你说四个五镑究竟是多少？” “要我算一下？” “嗯！”贾格斯先生说道，“你说是多少？” “我想你算出来是二十镑吧。”我笑着对他说道。 “你不必问我计算出来是多少，我的朋友，”贾格斯先生带着洞察一切的神情，但不赞成地昂起了头说道，“我所要知道的是你计算出来的是多少。” “自然是二十镑了。” “温米克！”贾格斯先生打开办公室的门，说道，“让皮普先生写一张收据，付给他二十镑。” 这种特别的处理事务的方式给我留下了特别的印象，这种印象无论如何是不令人愉快的。贾格斯先生从来没有笑容，但是，他穿了一双又大又亮又吱吱嘎嘎的皮靴。在他犹豫不决地踏着靴子站在那里，歪着他的大头，眉毛皱得快靠拢起来地等待着别人的回答时，会不时地踏一下靴子，发出吱嘎声，仿佛代替了他那种怀疑而又冷漠的笑。正巧他现在出去了，而温米克倒显得很活跃、很健谈，于是我对温米克说，要想弄清贾格斯先生的态度是很难的。 “你要告诉他数字，他觉得这才符合手续，”温米克答道，“他不是一定要你算——唔，我明白了！”他发现我面露不解，于是说道，“这不是他的个性如此，这是职业习惯，仅仅是职业习惯而已。” 温米克坐在桌边吃他的午餐，咬得又干又硬的饼于嘎喳嘎喳响。他把一片一片的饼干不断地丢进他张开的细长嘴巴，就像把一封一封信丢进邮筒一样。 “我永远有种感觉，”温米克说道，“他设计了一个捕人的机关，然后站在一旁监视着，只要你稍一疏忽，咔哒一声，你就被捉住了。” 我心里认为设置捕人的陷阱是不符合处世人情的，不过我没有挑明，只说贾格斯先生怕是个很精明的人。 温米克说道：“像澳大利亚那般深奥。”他用笔指着办公室的地板来示意澳大利亚是可以理解的，因为这是一个比喻，相对地说澳大利亚正在地球的对面。“如果说还有什么东西比澳大利亚更加深奥，”温米克把笔放到纸上，补充说道，“那就是他。” 然后我又说，我想贾格斯先生的生意一定干得挺好。温米克说：“很——不——错！”我又问他这里有许多办事员吗？对这个问题，他的回答是： “这里不需要许多办事人员，因为只有一个贾格斯先生，人们又不愿意通过间接方式和他打交道。我们一共有四个人，你要不要见见他们？你现在其实也不是外人了。” 我接受了他的盛情之邀。于是，他从衣领里掏出一根钢铁辫子似的东西，这就是收在他背上的保险箱钥匙。他用这钥匙打开了现金保险箱，从里面取出钱并交给我。这时他已经把所有的饼干一起塞进他那个邮筒似的嘴巴里，便和我一道上楼。房屋中很黑暗，又很破烂，那些在贾格斯先生房间中留下油腻腻的肩膀印的人，看来拖着缓慢的脚步在这里上上下下楼梯也有多年了，因为墙壁已被掠得油亮。二楼前部办公室里的办事员，看上去有点像酒店老板，又有些像捕鼠的人，身体长得大大的，面色苍白，而且有些浮肿。这时他正专心一致地接待着三四位外表很不体面的人，从态度上看，他对待他们很不礼貌，事实上每一位来到这里对贾格斯先生的钱柜有所贡献的人受到的都是这种待遇。温米克先生说：“他在为伦敦中央刑事法庭搜集证据。”我们走了出来。在上面一间办公室中的办事员是个小个儿，毫无生气，行动起来像一只狗，披着头发，大概在他还是小狗的时候就忘记了把毛剪短。他这时也正接待着一个人，这人的视力很差。温米克先生对我说，这个人是一个铸造假币的，他那个熔化金属的小坩锅一年到头都是烧得滚滚的，我随便有什么东西要他帮忙熔化铸造，他都会乐意的。这时，那人身上白色的汗珠正如雨下，仿佛他正在自己身上一试那熔化的高超技艺。里间办公室里有一个高耸双肩的人，可能由于面部神经痛，在脸上扎了一块肮脏的法兰绒布，穿了一件又旧又黑的衣服，看上去像涂了一层蜡，正弯腰驼背地抄写另外两位办事员先生起草的文件，都是为贾格斯先生准备的。 以上是整个律师事务所内的情况。我们又下了楼，温米克把我领到我监护人的办公室，说：“这一间你已经看过了。” 这时我看到那两个令人憎恶的头像，好像射出了凶狠的眼光。我问他：“请问一下这两个头像是谁？” “这两个头像吗？”温米克说着便爬上椅子，先把可怕头像头上的灰拂去，然后取了下来，说道，“这是两位了不起的人物。他们是两位著名的客户，曾给我们带来极大的荣誉。这一个嘛，怎么啦？你这个老流氓，你一定在夜里偷偷下来，把头探进墨水瓶里，让墨水染上了眉毛！这个家伙谋害了他的主人，一切阴谋安排妥当，连被害尸身也没有找到。” “这头像像他本人吗？”我问道。一听原来这是个残无人道者的头像，我吓得向后退去，而温米克却吐了一口唾沫在头像的眉毛上，又用袖口把它擦干净。 “像他吗？你知道，这就是他！这个头像是在新门监狱铸造而成的，是在他刚绞死后取的模型。喂，你这个老滑头，你对我特别有好感是不是？”温米克这般说着，一面用手摸摸自己的那枚胸针，胸针上有一位妇女的像，还有垂柳、坟墓以及墓旁的骨灰瓶，算是解释了他那种具有情感色彩的称呼，“你还为我定做了这枚胸针是不是？” “这女人是什么人吗？”我问道。 “不是什么人，”温米克答道，“只不过是他玩的一个小花样。你不是也喜欢弄些小花样吗，是不是？这和女人没有关系，皮普先生，如果说和某个女人有关系，除非一个，不过她不像这上面的女人那么苗条，你看她也不会专门照看这个骨灰瓶，除非里面装的是美酒。”这时温米克的注意力转向了他的胸针。他把头像放了下来，掏出手帕擦亮这枚胸针。 “另一个人的结果也是这样的下场么？”我问道，“他也有相同的神情呢。” “你说的一点不假，”温米克说道，“这是真面目。看这鼻孔里多像塞着一根马鬃和一只小鱼钩。他的确也是同样的命运；我敢说，在我们这儿有这种下场的人是不出奇的。这个人是一个花花公子，他假造遗嘱，那些被假立遗嘱的人怕也会给他弄得个长眠不醒呢！”接着温米克先生又对着头像说了起来： “噢，你这个绅士般的家伙，你说你会用希腊文写文章，你这个吹牛大王！你多么会撒谎啊！我从来没有遇到过像你这么会吹牛说谎的人！”温米克这时摸了摸他那只最大的悼念亡人的戒指，说道：“你在临死前一天还叫人买了这个东西来送给我。”然后他把这位昔日故友的头像又放回到架子上的原处。 他把另一个头像也放还原处后从椅子上爬下来。有一个疑问盘旋于我的内心，他那些私人珍宝都是这么得来的吗？当他站在我面前拍着两手的灰尘时，我想既然他并不因此而感到惭愧，我也就大着胆子向他提出了问题。 “噢，确确实实，”他答道，“这些全都是这一类的礼物。一个接一个地送给我，你看，事情就这样。既送之，则收之。这些东西不都很有意思吗，都是财产。也许价值不大，但毕竟是财产，而且是可携带的财产。对于你这个有远大前程的人来讲也许算不了什么，但是对于我来说，我的为人之道永远是，多捞财产，来者不拒。” 对他的见识我表示敬重，他便也以友好的态度继续讲下去： “一旦你有空，而且没有别的事可做时，如不在意，不妨到伍尔华斯我家中来玩玩，还可在我家过夜，这对我来说是一种荣幸。我没有什么让你欣赏，但也有两三件古董，也许你乐意看一下。我有一座小花园，还有一座凉亭，我是很喜欢的。” 我说我非常高兴接受他的盛情邀请。 “多谢，”他说道，“那么我们就这样决定了，什么时候你感到方便，就请过来。贾格斯先生和你吃过饭没有？” “还没有呢。” “好吧，”温米克说道，“他会请你喝葡萄酒的，是上等葡萄酒。我就请你喝混合葡萄酒，当然不是劣等的。现在我有件事要告诉你，你什么时候到贾格斯先生家去吃饭，留意一下他的那位管家妇。” “我会看到什么不寻常的事吗？” “是这样，”温米克说道，“你会看到一头被驯服了的野兽。也许你会说，这不是什么不寻常的事，不过我的回答是，一切要以原有的野蛮程度，以及驯化所需花费的时间精力为衡量标准，然后你就会了解贾格斯先生的能力了。你得留神观察。” 我告诉他我会留神观察的，因为他的忠告，唤起了我内心的兴趣和好奇。我正向他道别时，他问我有否兴趣再花五分钟去看看贾格斯先生“办公”？ 由于各种原因，至少由于我不十分了解贾格斯先生究竟在办什么公，所以我的回答是肯定的。我们赶进城，来到一处相当拥挤的违警罪法庭，见到一位生前对胸针特别稀奇的死者的血亲正在法庭上听候审理（当然这里的血亲是指在杀人流血方面关系密切之人），嘴里在不舒服地咀嚼着什么东西。这时我的监护人正在审问一位妇女，或者说在盘问她——我不知道该用什么词更好——这就使得这女人、法官老爷们、以及每一个在场的人都诚惶诚恐。如果有人，不管他的级别地位有多高，只要说一句贾格斯听不顺耳的话，他便立刻要人把话“记下来”。如果有人不认罪他便说：“我自有方法从他身上挖出供词！”如果有人认罪，他又会说：“看，我已经把你供词挖出来了！”他只要一咬手指，那些司法官们便吓得发抖。无论是做贼的，还是捉贼的都在恐怖中专心地听他的每一个词，只要他的一根眼睫毛对着他们的方向动了一下，他们便会心惊肉跳。我这位监护人究竟在为谁说话，我无法弄清；在我看来，他在这里折磨着所有的人。我只知道，在我跪着脚出来时，他不是在为法官们讲话，因为他指责当时正在主持审问的一位老法官，说他的行为表明他不能代表不列颠的法律坐在主审席上，使得老法官在审判桌下的双腿直抖。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/78/4532.html","bookId":540,"book":{"id":540,"title":"Great
