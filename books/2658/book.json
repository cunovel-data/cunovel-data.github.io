It\u0027s been years since she jilted him for another man, but that only means there\u0027s a lot to catch up on, a lot to make up for, and that he\u0027s going to enjoy every sweet moment... \n The same drive and passion that sent her into another man\u0027s arms is what brings Elizabeth back to Marcus. Her attraction to him is the one thing she fears, but she\u0027s run out of options. Resisting is impossible. But does she have the courage to surrender everything?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ask-for-it-georgian-1.jpg","author":"Sylvia Day","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":36,"category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
