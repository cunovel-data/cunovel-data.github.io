Or was I never to know until you came home in a coffin?”\n He scowled and crossed his arms over his chest. “I don’t see that it much matters now.”\n She stiffened at his icy tone. “All these years I feared reading the banns announcing your marriage. Instead I should have been perusing the obituaries.” Turning away, Elizabeth sheltered her racing heart with her hand. “How I wish you had stayed far, far away from me.” She gathered her skirts and hurried away. “I wish to God I’d never met you.”\n The sharp tapping of his heels on marble was the only warning she had before her elbow was caught and she was spun about.\n “The feeling is bloody damn mutual,” he growled.\n He towered over her, his sensual mouth drawn taut with anger, his emerald gaze sparkling with something that made her shiver.\n “How could Lord Eldridge assign you to me?” she cried. “And why did you accept?”\n “I insisted on taking this mission.”\n At her astonished gasp, his lips thinned further. “Make no mistake. You fled from me once. I will not allow it to happen again.” He tugged her closer and the air sweltered between them. His voice turned rough. “I don’t care if you marry the King himself this time. I will have you.”\n She struggled to escape, but his grip was firm. “Good heavens, Marcus. Haven’t we inflicted enough damage on one another?”\n “Not nearly.” He thrust her away as if the feel of her against him was distasteful. “Now let us dispatch this matter regarding your late husband so Avery can retire.”\n Shaking, Elizabeth moved swiftly toward Avery. Marcus followed behind her with the predatory gracefulness of a jungle cat.\n There was no doubt she was the one being hunted.\n She stopped beside Avery and took a shuddering breath before turning.\n Marcus watched her with an unreadable expression. “I understand you received a book written by your late husband.” He waited for her answering nod. “Is the sender familiar to you?”\n “The handwriting on the parcel was Hawthorne’s. It was obviously addressed some time ago, the wrapping was yellowed and the ink faded.” She had puzzled over the package for days, unable to determine its origin or its purpose.\n “Your husband addressed a package to himself and it arrives three years after his murder.” Marcus narrowed his gaze. “Did he leave any grilles1, any cards with odd holes in them, anything written that struck you as unusual?”\n “No, nothing.” She reached into her reticule, withdrawing the slim journal and the letter she’d received just a few days ago. She handed both to Marcus.\n After a cursory perusal he tucked the book into his coat and then glanced through the letter, a frown gathering between his brows as he read. “In the history of the agency only Lord Hawthorne’s murder remains unsolved. I had hoped to keep your involvement to a minimum.”\n “I will do whatever is necessary,” she offered quickly. “Hawthorne deserves justice and if my involvement is required, so be it.” Anything to finish this.\n Marcus folded the missive carefully. “I dislike exposing you to danger.”\n Her emotions on edge, Elizabeth bristled. “So you seek to withhold me from harm while risking your own neck? I am more heavily invested in the outcome of this than you or your precious agency.”\n Marcus growled her name in warning.\n Avery cleared his throat loudly. “It appears you two will not work well together. I would suggest bringing this difficulty to Lord Eldridge’s attention. I’m certain there are other agents who—”\n “No!” Marcus’s voice cracked like a whip.\n “Yes!” Elizabeth nearly collapsed in relief. “An excellent suggestion.” Her smile was heartfelt. “Surely Lord Eldridge will see the sense in the request.”\n “Running again?” Marcus taunted.\n She glared. “I am being practical. You and I quite obviously cannot associate with one another.”\n “Practical.” He gave a derisive snort. “The word you seek is craven.”\n “Lord Westfield!” Avery frowned.\n Elizabeth waved him off. “Leave us for a moment, Mr. James. If you would, please.” Her gaze remained locked on Marcus as Avery hesitated.\n “Do as she says,” Marcus murmured, glaring back at her. Avery grunted, then spun on his heel and moved away with angry strides.\n Elizabeth cut straight to it. “If I’m forced to work with you, Westfield, I will simply refuse to share any further information with the agency. I will handle the situation alone.”\n “Like hell you will!” The muscle in Marcus’s jaw began to tick. “I will not allow you to place yourself in jeopardy. Attempt something foolish and see what happens. You won’t like the outcome, I assure you.”\n “Truly?” she goaded, refusing to cower in the face of a temper that frightened most men. “And how do you propose to stop me?”\n Marcus approached her menacingly. “I am an agent of the Crown—”\n “We’ve established that.”\n “—on an assigned mission. Should you think to hinder my investigation I will view your actions as treasonous and treat you accordingly.”\n “You wouldn’t dare! Lord Eldridge would not allow it.”\n “Oh but I would, and he wouldn’t stop me.” He came to a halt before her. “This volume looks suspiciously like a journal of Hawthorne’s assignments and it could be related to his death. If so, you are in danger. Eldridge will not tolerate that any more than I.”\n “Why not?” she challenged. “Your feelings toward me are obvious.”\n He stepped closer, until the tips of his shoes disappeared beneath the edge of her hem. “Apparently not. However, plead your case to Eldridge if you must. Tell him how I affect you and how you long for me. Tell him about our sordid past and how even the memory of your dearly departed husband is not enough to overcome your desire.”\n She stared, and then her mouth fell open as a dry laugh escaped. “Your arrogance is stunning.” She turned away, hiding the way her hands shook. He could have the damn journal. She would seek out Eldridge in the morning.\n His mocking laughter followed her. “My arrogance? You are the one who thinks this is all about her.”\n Elizabeth stopped and spun about. “You made this personal with your threats.”\n “You and I becoming lovers is not a threat. It is a foregone conclusion and has nothing to do with your late husband’s journal.” He held up his hand when she attempted to argue. “Save your breath. This mission is important to Eldridge. I insisted for that reason alone. Having you in my bed does not require working with you.”\n “But …” She paused, recalling what he’d said to her earlier. He never stated his insistence was about her. Her face heated.\n Marcus strolled casually past her, heading in the direction of the ballroom. “So feel free to disclose to Eldridge why you cannot work with me. Just be certain he understands that I have no difficulty at all working with you.”\n Gritting her teeth, Elizabeth bit back every expletive that fought to blurt from her mouth. No fool she, she understood his game. She also understood he would not leave her be until he decided he’d had enough, mission or not. The only part of this debacle that was within her power to control was whether she survived this encounter with her pride intact.\n Her stomach tightened. Now that she had rejoined society she would have to watch his seductions. She would be forced to associate with the women who caught his fancy. She would see the smiles he shared with them, but not with her.\n Damnation. Her breathing quickened. Against every shred of self-respect and intelligence she had, she took the first step to follow him.\n The soft touch upon her elbow reminded her of Avery’s presence. “Lady Hawthorne. Is everything well?”\n She gave a jerky nod.\n “I will speak with Lord Eldridge as soon as possible and—”\n “That won’t be necessary, Mr. James.”\n Elizabeth waited until Marcus rounded the corner and disappeared from her view before facing Avery. “My role is simply to deliver the journal. Once that is accomplished the rest remains up to you and Lord Westfield. I see no need to change agents.”\n “Are you certain?”\n She nodded again, anxious to finish the conversation and return to the ballroom.\n Avery’s look was clearly skeptical, but he said, “Very well. I will assign two armed outriders to you. Take them with you everywhere and send word to me as soon as you receive details about the meeting.”\n “Of course.”\n “Since we’ve finished here, I shall depart.” His smile held a touch of relief. “I never cared much for these affairs.”\n He lifted her hand and kissed the back.\n “Elizabeth?” William’s booming voice rang through the vast space.\n Eyes wide, she clutched Avery’s fingers. “My brother must not see you. He’ll suspect immediately that something is amiss.”\n Avery, appreciating her concern and trained to think on his feet, nodded grimly and ducked swiftly behind a rounded bush.\n Turning, she caught sight of William approaching. Like Marcus, he didn’t mince his steps. He walked toward her with casual grace, his leg bearing no outward sign of the injury that had almost taken his life.\n Although they were siblings they could not have been more disparate in appearance. She had the raven hair and amethyst eyes of their mother. William had the fair hair and bluish-green eyes of their father. Tall and broad-shouldered he had the look of a Viking, strong and dangerous but prone to mirth as witnessed by the fine laugh lines that rimmed his eyes.\n “What are you about?” he queried, casting an overly curious glance around the atrium.\n Elizabeth tucked her hand in the crook of his elbow, and steered him toward the ballroom. “I was merely enjoying the view. Where is Margaret?”\n “With her acquaintances.” William slowed and then stopped, forcing her to halt with him. “I was told you danced with Westfield earlier.”\n “Gossip already?”\n “Stay away from him, Elizabeth,” he warned softly.\n “There was no polite way to refuse him.”\n “Do not be polite. I don’t trust him. It’s odd that he is in attendance tonight.”\n She sighed sadly at the rift she’d caused. Marcus made poor husband material, but he’d been a good friend to William. “The reputation he’s established these last few years has justified my actions of long ago. I’m in no danger of being swept away by his charms again, I assure you.”\n Tugging William toward the ballroom, Elizabeth was relieved when her brother gave no further resistance. If they hurried, she might be able to see where Marcus was headed.\n Marcus stepped out from his hiding place behind a tree and brushed a stray leaf from his coat. Kicking dirt off his shoes, his gaze remained riveted on Elizabeth’s retreating back until she disappeared from his sight. He wondered if it was obvious, this maddening desire he had for her. His heart raced and his legs ached with the effort he exerted not to follow her and snatch her away for his pleasure.\n She was infuriatingly stubborn and obstinate, which is how he’d known she was perfect for him. No other woman could arouse his passions thusly. Furious or consumed with lust, only Elizabeth made his blood heat with the need to have her.\n He wished to God it was love he felt. That emotion faded eventually, burning out once the fuel was gone. Hunger only grew worse with time, aching and gnawing until it was fed.\n Avery appeared at his side. “If that is what you call an ‘old friend,’ my lord, I would hate to see what your enemies are like.”\n His smile held no humor. “She was to be my wife.” Stunned silence was the reply. “Have I rendered you speechless?”\n “Damnation.”\n “An apt description.” Girding himself inwardly, Marcus asked, “Does she plan to speak with Eldridge?”\n “No.” Avery shot him a sidelong glance. “Are you certain your involvement is wise?”\n “No,” he admitted, relieved his ploy had worked and grateful that, despite the years, he still knew her so well. “But I’m certain I have no other choice.”\n “Eldridge is determined to catch Hawthorne’s murderer. In the course of our mission we may be forced to deliberately put Lady Hawthorne in danger to achieve our aims.”\n “No. Hawthorne is dead. Risking Elizabeth’s life will not bring him back. We will find other ways to carry out our mission.”\n Avery shook his head in silent bemusement. “I trust you know what you are about, even if I do not. Now if you will excuse me, my lord, I shall make my egress through the garden, before anything else untoward occurs.”\n “I believe I’ll accompany you.” Falling into step beside his partner, Marcus laughed at Avery’s raised brow. “When engaged in prolonged battle, a man must be prepared to retreat on occasion so that he may return refreshed to seize the day.”\n “Good God. Battles and brothers and broken engagements. Your personal history with Lady Hawthorne will only lead to trouble.”\n Marcus rubbed his hands together. “I look forward to it.”\n Chapter 3\n “I am under siege!” Elizabeth complained as another obnoxiously large display of flowers was carried into the sitting room.\n “There are worse fates for a woman than being courted by a devilishly handsome peer of the realm,” Margaret said dryly, as she smoothed her skirts and sat upon the settee. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ask-for-it-georgian-1/page-3.html","bookId":2658,"book":{"id":2658,"title":"Ask For It (Georgian #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Ask For It (Georgian #1) \n Fearless Surrender \n Nothing incites Marcus more than the primal hunger roused by his former fiancée, Elizabeth.
