{"id":30223,"no":83,"title":"Chapter 82","content":"\"Fleet Street?\" Langdon asked, eyeing Teabing in the back of the limo. There\u0027s a crypt on FleetStreet? So far, Leigh was being playfully cagey about where he thought they would find the\"knight\u0027s tomb,\" which, according to the poem, would provide the password for opening thesmaller cryptex.\n 　　Teabing grinned and turned to Sophie. \"Miss Neveu, give the Harvard boy one more shot at theverse, will you?\"Sophie fished in her pocket and pulled out the black cryptex, which was wrapped in the vellum.\n 　　Everyone had decided to leave the rosewood box and larger cryptex behind in the plane\u0027sstrongbox, carrying with them only what they needed, the far more portable and discreet blackcryptex. Sophie unwrapped the vellum and handed the sheet to Langdon.\n 　　Although Langdon had read the poem several times onboard the jet, he had been unable to extractany specific location. Now, as he read the words again, he processed them slowly and carefully,hoping the pentametric rhythms would reveal a clearer meaning now that he was on the ground.\n 　　In London lies a knight a Pope interred.\n 　　His labor\u0027s fruit a Holy wrath incurred.\n 　　You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.\n 　　It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb.\n 　　The language seemed simple enough. There was a knight buried in London. A knight who laboredat something that angered the Church. A knight whose tomb was missing an orb that should bepresent. The poem\u0027s final reference—Rosy flesh and seeded womb—was a clear allusion to MaryMagdalene, the Rose who bore the seed of Jesus.\n 　　Despite the apparent straightforwardness of the verse, Langdon still had no idea who this knightwas or where he was buried. Moreover, once they located the tomb, it sounded as if they would besearching for something that was absent. The orb that ought be on his tomb?\n 　　\"No thoughts?\" Teabing clucked in disappointment, although Langdon sensed the Royal Historianwas enjoying being one up. \"Miss Neveu?\"She shook her head.\n 　　\"What would you two do without me?\" Teabing said. \"Very well, I will walk you through it. It\u0027squite simple really. The first line is the key. Would you read it please?\"Langdon read aloud. \" \u0027In London lies a knight a Pope interred.\u0027 \"\"Precisely. A knight a Pope interred.\" He eyed Langdon. \"What does that mean to you?\"Langdon shrugged. \"A knight buried by a Pope? A knight whose funeral was presided over by aPope?\"Teabing laughed loudly. \"Oh, that\u0027s rich. Always the optimist, Robert. Look at the second line.\n 　　This knight obviously did something that incurred the Holy wrath of the Church. Think again.\n 　　Consider the dynamic between the Church and the Knights Templar. A knight a Pope interred?\"\"A knight a Pope killed?\" Sophie asked.\n 　　Teabing smiled and patted her knee. \"Well done, my dear. A knight a Pope buried. Or killed.\"Langdon thought of the notorious Templar round-up in 1307—unlucky Friday thethirteenth—when Pope Clement killed and interred hundreds of Knights Templar. \"But there mustbe endless graves of \u0027knights killed by Popes.\u0027 \"\"Aha, not so! \"Teabing said. \"Many of them were burned at the stake and tossed unceremoniouslyinto the Tiber River. But this poem refers to a tomb. A tomb in London. And there are few knightsburied in London.\" He paused, eyeing Langdon as if waiting for light to dawn. Finally he huffed.\n 　　\"Robert, for heaven\u0027s sake! The church built in London by the Priory\u0027s military arm—the KnightsTemplar themselves!\"\"The Temple Church?\" Langdon drew a startled breath. \"It has a crypt?\"\"Ten of the most frightening tombs you will ever see.\"Langdon had never actually visited the Temple Church, although he\u0027d come across numerousreferences in his Priory research. Once the epicenter of all Templar/Priory activities in the UnitedKingdom, the Temple Church had been so named in honor of Solomon\u0027s Temple, from which theKnights Templar had extracted their own title, as well as the Sangreal documents that gave them alltheir influence in Rome. Tales abounded of knights performing strange, secretive rituals within theTemple Church\u0027s unusual sanctuary. \"The Temple Church is on Fleet Street?\"\"Actually, it\u0027s just off Fleet Street on Inner Temple Lane.\" Teabing looked mischievous. \"I wantedto see you sweat a little more before I gave it away.\"\"Thanks.\"\"Neither of you has ever been there?\"Sophie and Langdon shook their heads.\n 　　\"I\u0027m not surprised,\" Teabing said. \"The church is hidden now behind much larger buildings. Fewpeople even know it\u0027s there. Eerie old place. The architecture is pagan to the core.\"Sophie looked surprised. \"Pagan?\"\"Pantheonically pagan!\" Teabing exclaimed. \"The church is round. The Templars ignored thetraditional Christian cruciform layout and built a perfectly circular church in honor of the sun.\" Hiseyebrows did a devilish dance. \"A not so subtle howdy-do to the boys in Rome. They might as wellhave resurrected Stonehenge in downtown London.\"Sophie eyed Teabing. \"What about the rest of the poem?\"The historian\u0027s mirthful air faded. \"I\u0027m not sure. It\u0027s puzzling. We will need to examine each of theten tombs carefully. With luck, one of them will have a conspicuously absent orb.\"Langdon realized how close they really were. If the missing orb revealed the password, they wouldbe able to open the second cryptex. He had a hard time imagining what they might find inside.\n 　　Langdon eyed the poem again. It was like some kind of primordial crossword puzzle. A five-letterword that speaks of the Grail? On the plane, they had already tried all the obviouspasswords—GRAIL, GRAAL, GREAL, VENUS, MARIA, JESUS, SARAH—but the cylinder hadnot budged. Far too obvious. Apparently there existed some other five-letter reference to the Rose\u0027sseeded womb. The fact that the word was eluding a specialist like Leigh Teabing signified toLangdon that it was no ordinary Grail reference.\n 　　\"Sir Leigh?\" Rémy called over his shoulder. He was watching them in the rearview mirror throughthe open divider. \"You said Fleet Street is near Blackfriars Bridge?\"\"Yes, take Victoria Embankment.\"\"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m not sure where that is. We usually go only to the hospital.\"Teabing rolled his eyes at Langdon and Sophie and grumbled, \"I swear, sometimes it\u0027s like baby-sitting a child. One moment please. Help yourself to a drink and savory snacks.\" He left them,clambering awkwardly toward the open divider to talk to Rémy.\n 　　Sophie turned to Langdon now, her voice quiet. \"Robert, nobody knows you and I are in England.\"Langdon realized she was right. The Kent police would tell Fache the plane was empty, and Fachewould have to assume they were still in France. We are invisible. Leigh\u0027s little stunt had just boughtthem a lot of time.\n 　　\"Fache will not give up easily,\" Sophie said. \"He has too much riding on this arrest now.\"Langdon had been trying not to think about Fache. Sophie had promised she would do everythingin her power to exonerate Langdon once this was over, but Langdon was starting to fear it mightnot matter. Fache could easily be pan of this plot. Although Langdon could not imagine theJudicial Police tangled up in the Holy Grail, he sensed too much coincidence tonight to disregardFache as a possible accomplice. Fache is religions, and he is intent on pinning these murders onme. Then again, Sophie had argued that Fache might simply be overzealous to make the arrest.\n 　　After all, the evidence against Langdon was substantial. In addition to Langdon\u0027s name scrawled onthe Louvre floor and in Saunière\u0027s date book, Langdon now appeared to have lied about hismanuscript and then run away. At Sophie\u0027s suggestion.\n 　　\"Robert, I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re so deeply involved,\" Sophie said, placing her hand on his knee. \"But I\u0027mvery glad you\u0027re here.\"The comment sounded more pragmatic than romantic, and yet Langdon felt an unexpected flickerof attraction between them. He gave her a tired smile. \"I\u0027m a lot more fun when I\u0027ve slept.\"Sophie was silent for several seconds. \"My grandfather asked me to trust you. I\u0027m glad I listened tohim for once.\"\"Your grandfather didn\u0027t even know me.\"\"Even so, I can\u0027t help but think you\u0027ve done everything he would have wanted. You helped me findthe keystone, explained the Sangreal, told me about the ritual in the basement.\" She paused.\n 　　\"Somehow I feel closer to my grandfather tonight than I have in years. I know he would be happyabout that.\"In the distance, now, the skyline of London began to materialize through the dawn drizzle. Oncedominated by Big Ben and Tower Bridge, the horizon now bowed to the Millennium Eye—acolossal, ultramodern Ferris wheel that climbed five hundred feet and afforded breathtaking viewsof the city. Langdon had attempted to board it once, but the \"viewing capsules\" reminded him ofsealed sarcophagi, and he opted to keep his feet on the ground and enjoy the view from the airybanks of the Thames.\n 　　Langdon felt a squeeze on his knee, pulling him back, and Sophie\u0027s green eyes were on him. Herealized she had been speaking to him. \"What do you think we should do with the Sangrealdocuments if we ever find them?\" she whispered.\n 　　\"What I think is immaterial,\" Langdon said. \"Your grandfather gave the cryptex to you, and youshould do with it what your instinct tells you he would want done.\"\"I\u0027m asking for your opinion. You obviously wrote something in that manuscript that made mygrandfather trust your judgment. He scheduled a private meeting with you. That\u0027s rare.\"\"Maybe he wanted to tell me I have it all wrong.\"\"Why would he tell me to find you unless he liked your ideas? In your manuscript, did you supportthe idea that the Sangreal documents should be revealed or stay buried?\"\"Neither. I made no judgment either way. The manuscript deals with the symbology of the sacredfeminine—tracing her iconography throughout history. I certainly didn\u0027t presume to know wherethe Grail is hidden or whether it should ever be revealed.\"\"And yet you\u0027re writing a book about it, so you obviously feel the information should be shared.\"\"There\u0027s an enormous difference between hypothetically discussing an alternate history of Christ,and...\" He paused.\n 　　\"And what?\"\"And presenting to the world thousands of ancient documents as scientific evidence that the NewTestament is false testimony.\"\"But you told me the New Testament is based on fabrications.\"Langdon smiled. \"Sophie, every faith in the world is based on fabrication. That is the definition offaith—acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove. Every religiondescribes God through metaphor, allegory, and exaggeration, from the early Egyptians throughmodern Sunday school. Metaphors are a way to help our minds process the unprocessible. Theproblems arise when we begin to believe literally in our own metaphors.\"\"So you are in favor of the Sangreal documents staying buried forever?\"\"I\u0027m a historian. I\u0027m opposed to the destruction of documents, and I would love to see religiousscholars have more information to ponder the exceptional life of Jesus Christ.\"\"You\u0027re arguing both sides of my question.\"\"Am I? The Bible represents a fundamental guidepost for millions of people on the planet, in muchthe same way the Koran, Torah, and Pali Canon offer guidance to people of other religions. If youand I could dig up documentation that contradicted the holy stories of Islamic belief, Judaic belief,Buddhist belief, pagan belief, should we do that? Should we wave a flag and tell the Buddhists thatwe have proof the Buddha did not come from a lotus blossom? Or that Jesus was not born of aliteral virgin birth? Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories aremetaphorical.\"Sophie looked skeptical. \"My friends who are devout Christians definitely believe that Christliterally walked on water, literally turned water into wine, and was born of a literal virgin birth.\"\"My point exactly,\" Langdon said. \"Religious allegory has become a part of the fabric of reality.\n 　　And living in that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people.\"\"But it appears their reality is false.\"Langdon chuckled. \"No more false than that of a mathematical cryptographer who believes in theimaginary number \u0027i\u0027 because it helps her break codes.\"Sophie frowned. \"That\u0027s not fair.\"A moment passed.\n 　　\"What was your question again?\" Langdon asked.\n 　　\"I can\u0027t remember.\"He smiled. \"Works every time.\"\n \"舰队街？\"兰登在车后看着提彬，问道。舰队街藏有墓穴？迄今为止，雷爵士竟然还在耍他的把戏，对将在何处找到那\"骑士的坟墓\"只字不提。然而据那首诗上讲，要找到密码从而解开那更小密码盒里的谜，就非得找到这座\"骑士的坟墓\"不可。\n 提彬张嘴笑了笑，转身对索菲说：\"奈芙小姐，让这位哈佛大学的高材生再看看那首诗怎么样？\"\n 索菲在口袋里翻了一阵，然后把用羊皮纸包着的黑色密码盒拿出来。大家一致决定将紫檀木盒子以及更大的密码盒搁在一边，放进飞机的保险箱里，只带上他们急需的、更轻便、更让人费脑筋的黑色密码盒。索菲摊开羊皮纸，将纸条递给了兰登。\n 兰登刚才虽然在飞机上已将这首诗读了好几遍，但他还是未能想出坟墓的具体位置。\n 这回他又在读着那些诗句，缓慢而又认真地，希望能从五步抑扬格的节奏里找到更为明晰的意义--既然现在，他们已从天空来到了坚实的土地。\n 诗是这样写的：在伦敦葬了一位教皇为他主持葬礼的骑士。\n 他的行为触怒了上帝，因为违背了他的旨意。\n 你们寻找的圆球，本应在这位骑士的墓里。\n 它道破了玫瑰般肌肤与受孕子宫的秘密。\n 诗的语言似乎简洁明了，说是有一位骑士葬在伦敦，这位骑士大概做了什么事情触怒了天主教会。一个本该在他的坟墓里的圆球不见了。诗在最后提到了\"玫瑰般肌肤与受孕的子宫\"，显然是指抹大拉的玛丽亚--这朵怀上耶稣基督种的\"玫瑰\"。\n 尽管诗歌简单明了，兰登依然不知道这位骑士是谁，葬在哪里。而且一旦确定了坟墓的位置，他们似乎就得寻找什么遗失的东西。那个本该在坟墓里的圆球？\n \"有什么想法吗？\"提彬咂着嘴巴，说。他似乎有些失望，尽管兰登觉得这位皇家学会的历史学家正为自己有了想法而高兴不已。提彬转而问：\"奈芙小姐，你呢？\"\n 她摇了摇头。\n \"那你们两个如果没了我，可怎么办啊？\"提彬打趣地说：\"很好，我会陪你们一路玩到底的。其实说来非常简单，第一句就是关键。你读读看怎么样？\"\n 兰登朗声读起来：\"在伦敦葬了一位教皇为他主持葬礼的骑士。\"\n \"很好，一位教皇为他主持葬礼的骑士。\"他盯着兰登：\"你认为这是什么意思？\"\n 兰登耸了耸肩：\"是不是这位骑士是由教皇来埋葬他的？或者是他的葬礼是由教皇来主持的？\"\n 提彬大声笑了起来：\"哈，真有意思。罗伯特，你总是个乐观主义者。你再看下句。这位骑士很明显做了什么事情触犯了教会的神威。你再想想，考虑一下教会与圣殿骑士之间的关系。你就会明白它的含义。\"\"难道骑士是被教皇处死的？\"索菲问道。\n 提彬微笑着拍拍她的膝盖：\"亲爱的，你真棒。一位被教皇活埋的骑士，或者是被教皇杀死的骑士。\"兰登猛地想起发生在1307 年的那次臭名昭著的围剿圣殿骑士的事件--在那个充满不祥气氛的第十三日，黑色星期五，教皇克雷芒杀害并活埋了成百上千的圣殿骑士。\"不过，肯定有无数被教皇杀害的骑士们的坟墓。\n \"哦，不对不对。\"提彬赶忙说道：\"他们大多数人是被绑在刑柱上烧死的，然后被扔进台伯河，连个仪式也没有。然而这首诗指的是一个坟墓，一个位于伦敦的坟墓，不过在伦敦，很少有骑士是被烧死的啊。\"他顿了顿，盯视着兰登，一动也不动，就像在盼着曙光盼着黎明。他终于愤怒了：\"罗伯特，看在上帝的份上，它就在由郇山隐修会的军队--圣殿骑士们亲自建造于伦敦的教堂里啊！\"\"你是说圣殿教堂？\"兰登吃了一惊，不由得倒抽了一口气：\"它那里有坟墓？\"\n \"当然，在那里，你会看到十个最让你触目惊心的坟墓。\"\n 实际上，兰登从没去过圣殿教堂，尽管他在研究郇山隐修会的过程中，曾无数次参考过有关它的资料。圣殿教堂曾是所有圣殿骑士们和郇山隐修会的活动中心，是为了向所罗门的圣庙表示敬意。圣殿骑士们的头衔，就是这座教堂赐封的。另外，《圣杯文献》也使他们在罗马产生了巨大的影响。有关骑士在圣殿教堂别具一格的礼拜堂里举行神秘而又奇异仪式的传说铺天盖地，层出不穷。\n \"圣殿教堂位于舰队街？\"\n \"实际上，它就在离圣殿教堂内通道上的舰队街不远的地方。\"提彬俏皮地说：\"我本不打算告诉你，想让你流更多的汗水，费更多的脑筋。\"\"有劳费心了。\"\n \"你俩都没去过那里？\"\n 兰登和索菲都摇了摇头。\n \"我并不觉得奇怪，教堂现隐藏在比它大得多的建筑物后面。甚至很少有人知道它在那里。那真是阴森可怕的地方。教堂从里到外，都带有异教的建筑色彩。\"索菲惊讶地问：\"带有异教的建筑色彩？\"\n \"绝对是异教徒的建筑风格！\"提彬大声说道：\"教堂的外形呈圆形。圣殿骑士们为了表达对太阳的敬意，抛弃了传统的基督教十字形的建筑布局和模式，建造了这座完全呈圆形的教堂。\"他的眉毛狠狠的跳动了一下。\"这就触动了罗马教廷的僧侣们敏感的神经。这与他们在伦敦市区复兴史前巨石柱的异教风格，也许没什么区别。\"索菲瞄了提彬一眼：\"那诗的其余部分呢？\"\n 这位皇家历史学家的高兴劲儿逐渐消失了。\"我也说不准。这真让人为难。我们还得对那十座坟墓逐一认真检查呢。如果运气好，也许就会找到那座一眼就知道没有圆球的坟墓。\"兰登意识到他们现在离目标有多近了。如果那个失踪的圆球会泄露他们要找的密码，那他们就可以打开第二个密码盒。他费了很大的劲，想象着他们会在里面发现什么。\n 兰登又开始读起子那首诗。它有点类似于原始的纵横字谜游戏。一个能揭开圣杯的秘密，由五个字母组成的词？在飞机上，他们已试过所有明显由五个字母组成的词，如GRAIL，GRAAL，GREAL，VENUS，MARIA，JESUS，SARAH 等等。这些词太明显了，显然还有其他一些由五个字母组成并与这朵圣洁\"玫瑰\"的子宫有关联的词。即使雷。提彬这样的专家也不能一下找到，对兰登来说，这就意味着它绝不是一个普通的词。\n \"雷爵士！\"雷米回头喊道。他正通过敞开的隔离间，从车上的后视镜注视着他们。\"你是说舰队街就在布莱克弗莱尔桥附近？\"\n \"对，要经过维多利亚大堤。\"\n \"对不起，我不知道是在哪里。我们平时只去医院。\"\n 提彬朝兰登和索菲滚动着眼珠子：\"妈的，有时候我真觉得是在带一个小孩子。你们稍等一会。自己动手喝点饮料，吃点零食吧。\"他站起身，笨拙的爬到敞开着的隔离间，去跟雷米说话。\n 索菲转向兰登，轻轻地说：\"罗伯特，现在无人知道我们在英格兰呢。\"\n 兰登知道她说的是实话。肯特郡的警察局肯定会告诉法希，飞机里什么东西也没有，因此法希难免会以为他们还没离开法国。我们现在在暗处呢。不过，雷爵士玩弄的把戏却浪费了他们大量的时间。\n \"法希是决不会轻易放弃的。\"索菲说道：\"他这次是铁了心，非要把我们抓住，才肯罢休。\"兰登一直不愿考虑有关法希的事情。尽管索菲曾答应过他，说等这件事办完，她将尽最大的努力，采取一切补救措施为他开脱罪责。然而他开始担心，这样做恐怕无济于事。\n 法希说不定能轻易成为这次阴谋中的一部分哩。尽管兰登无法想象，警察署竟然会在处理圣杯这事情上乱成一团，但他还是觉得，今天晚上的巧合实在是太多子。因此，他没法不将法希视作隐藏在背后的帮凶。法希是名教徒，然而他却蓄意将谋杀的一系列罪名栽赃到我的头上。还有就是，索菲曾说过，法希也许对这次追捕显得有点热心过头了。然而不管怎样，眼下对兰登不利的证据实在太多了，除了卢浮宫里的地板上、索尼埃的日志里歪歪斜斜地写有他的名字外，这次兰登似乎再次撒了个弥天大谎，然后逃之夭夭。这还是索菲在提醒他呢。\n \"罗伯特，我很抱歉把你牵扯进来，而且让你陷得这么深。\"索菲说着，把手搭在他的膝盖上。\"可有你在身边我真的很高兴。\"\n 她的话绝非夸大其词，而纯粹是肺腑之言，然而兰登还是觉得陡然生出几分意想不到的亲近来。他疲惫地给了她一个微笑：\"等我睡了觉，你会发现我更有意思哩。\"\n 索菲沉默了数秒：\"我祖父叫我相信你，我很高兴好歹听了他一次。\"\n \"可你祖父甚至还不认识我呢。\"\n \"即使是这样，我也认为你做了他想让你做的一切。你帮我找到了拱心石，给我讲述圣杯的来历，又跟我谈了地下室里的\"神婚\"仪式。\"她停了片刻：\"不管怎么说，我觉得今晚比以前任何时候跟祖父都靠得近了。我想他老人家肯定会很高兴的。\"透过清晨的蒙蒙细雨，远处的伦敦开始隐约可见。以前，伦敦最引人注目的是大笨钟与塔桥，然而现在被抢眼的\"千禧眼\"所取代了，它是一个硕大而前卫的费里斯大转轮，有五百英尺高，形成了这座城市又一令人叹为观止的景观。兰登曾想爬上去坐坐，但这些观光舱，使他联想到密封起来的肉罐头，因此他最终选择留在了地上，欣赏这泰晤士河水汽氤氲的堤岸两边的无限风光。\n 兰登忽然觉得有人掐了他膝盖一把，将他往后拖。等他回过头，索菲的绿眼睛正逼视着他。他这才知道，原来索菲一直不停地在跟他说话。\"如果我们找到《圣杯文献》，你看该如何处置呢？\"她轻声地说。\n \"我有什么想法并不重要。你祖父把密码盒给了你，你会处理好的。因为直觉告诉你，你祖父会让你这么做的。\"\"我在征求你的意见呢。你显然在书稿里写了什么东西，使我祖父相信你的判断，所以他才打算私下里跟你见面。这很不简单啊。\"\"也许他想跟我说，你把东西全弄错了。\"\n \"要是他不欣赏你的观点，他又何必让我来找你？你在书稿里是赞成将《圣杯文献》公开呢，还是将它藏起来？\"\n \"哪方面我都没有说。我在文稿中谈到神圣女性的象征意义，回顾了它被人崇拜的整部历史。我当然不能武断地说，我知道圣杯藏在哪，应不应该将它公布于天下。\"\"可你在写一本有关它的书呢，所以你显然觉得应该共享有关它的材料。\"\n \"无中生有地讨论耶稣基督的另一番历史跟--\"他暂停了一会。\n \"跟什么？\"\n \"跟把成千上万份古代文献公布于世，并以此作为《新约》是虚假的科学依据，这之间还是有很大的差别。\"\"可你告诉我《新约》是杜撰出来的呢。\"\n 兰登笑了笑：\"索菲，要我说世界上所有的宗教信仰都是建立在虚构的基础上的。这就是我对宗教信仰的定义--即相信我们想象的真实，盲从我们无法证明的东西。无论是古埃及人还是当代宗教，都是通过隐喻、寓言以及夸张的方式来描绘他们心目中的神或上帝。隐喻是这样一种方式，它可以帮助我们加工原本无法处理的东西。等我们开始完全相信自己为自己编造的隐喻时，问题也就出来了。\"\"所以你赞成将《圣杯文献》永远地隐藏起来？\"\n \"我是历史学家，我反对任何人损坏这些文献，而且我很乐意看到研究宗教的学者们，有更多的历史材料去探索耶稣基督非同寻常的人生。\"\"你对我问题的两个方面都提出了反驳呢。\"\n \"是吗？《圣经》给居住在这个星球上成千上万的人们设置了一个最根本的路标，《可兰经》、《犹太律法》，还有《巴利教规》，也以完全相同的方式，给信仰其它宗教的许多人指点了迷津。假如你我能找到一些与伊斯兰教、犹太教、佛教以及异教的传说相背离的材料，我们会那样做吗？我们会挥舞着手中的旗帜，对那些佛教徒说，我们能证明佛主不是从莲花里生出来的吗？或者告诉那些基督徒，耶稣不是真从处女的子宫里孕育出来的吗？\n 那些真正理解自身信仰的人，通常也知道这些故事传说是隐喻性的。\"索菲半信半疑：\"我那些虔诚的基督徒朋友相信基督真能在水上行走，能够将水变成真的美酒，并且相信他果真是处女生的。\"\"这完全印证了我的观点。\"兰登说道：\"宗教性的隐喻成了对现实进行虚构的一部分。\n 而在现实里，又有助于芸芸众生从容应对，完善自我。\"\"但是，他们面对的现实是虚假的现实。\"\n 兰登咯咯地笑了起来：\"不过，再怎么虚假，总比一位对臆想的数字\"i\"深信不疑的密码破译专家要来得真实些吧？！因为她竟然相信，这会有助于她破译密码。\"索菲皱起了眉：\"你这么说是不公平的。\"\n 两人沉默了一会。\n \"你刚才还问了什么问题来着？\"兰登突然问。\n \"我不记得了。\"\n 兰登笑了起来：\"你可真行啊。\"\n \n
