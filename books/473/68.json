{"id":30208,"no":68,"title":"Chapter 67","content":"The Range Rover was Java Black Pearl, four-wheel drive, standard transmission, with high-strength polypropylene lamps, rear light cluster fittings, and the steering wheel on the right. 　　Langdon was pleased he was not driving. 　　Teabing\u0027s manservant Rémy, on orders from his master, was doing an impressive job ofmaneuvering the vehicle across the moonlit fields behind Chateau Villette. With no headlights, hehad crossed an open knoll and was now descending a long slope, moving farther away from theestate. He seemed to be heading toward a jagged silhouette of wooded land in the distance. 　　Langdon, cradling the keystone, turned in the passenger seat and eyed Teabing and Sophie in theback seat. 　　\"How\u0027s your head, Robert?\" Sophie asked, sounding concerned. 　　Langdon forced a pained smile. \"Better, thanks.\" It was killing him. 　　Beside her, Teabing glanced over his shoulder at the bound and gagged monk lying in the crampedluggage area behind the back seat. Teabing had the monk\u0027s gun on his lap and looked like an oldphoto of a British safari chap posing over his kill. 　　\"So glad you popped in this evening, Robert,\" Teabing said, grinning as if he were having fun forthe first time in years. 　　\"Sorry to get you involved in this, Leigh.\"\"Oh, please, I\u0027ve waited my entire life to be involved.\" Teabing looked past Langdon out thewindshield at the shadow of a long hedgerow. He tapped Rémy on the shoulder from behind. 　　\"Remember, no brake lights. Use the emergency brake if you need it. I want to get into the woods abit. No reason to risk them seeing us from the house.\"Rémy coasted to a crawl and guided the Range Rover through an opening in the hedge. As thevehicle lurched onto an overgrown pathway, almost immediately the trees overhead blotted out themoonlight. 　　I can\u0027t see a thing, Langdon thought, straining to distinguish any shapes at all in front of them. Itwas pitch black. Branches rubbed against the left side of the vehicle, and Rémy corrected in theother direction. Keeping the wheel more or less straight now, he inched ahead about thirty yards. 　　\"You\u0027re doing beautifully, Rémy,\" Teabing said. \"That should be far enough. Robert, if you couldpress that little blue button just below the vent there. See it?\"Langdon found the button and pressed it. 　　A muted yellow glow fanned out across the path in front of them, revealing thick underbrush oneither side of the pathway. Fog lights, Langdon realized. They gave off just enough light to keepthem on the path, and yet they were deep enough into the woods now that the lights would not givethem away. 　　\"Well, Rémy,\" Teabing chimed happily. \"The lights are on. Our lives are in your hands.\"\"Where are we going?\" Sophie asked. 　　\"This trail continues about three kilometers into the forest,\" Teabing said. \"Cutting across the estateand then arching north. Provided we don\u0027t hit any standing water or fallen trees, we shall emergeunscathed on the shoulder of highway five.\"Unscathed. Langdon\u0027s head begged to differ. He turned his eyes down to his own lap, where thekeystone was safely stowed in its wooden box. The inlaid Rose on the lid was back in place, andalthough his head felt muddled, Langdon was eager to remove the inlay again and examine theengraving beneath more closely. He unlatched the lid and began to raise it when Teabing laid ahand on his shoulder from behind. 　　\"Patience, Robert,\" Teabing said. \"It\u0027s bumpy and dark. God save us if we break anything. If youdidn\u0027t recognize the language in the light, you won\u0027t do any better in the dark. Let\u0027s focus on gettingaway in one piece, shall we? There will be time for that very soon.\"Langdon knew Teabing was right. With a nod, he relatched the box. 　　The monk in back was moaning now, struggling against his trusses. Suddenly, he began kickingwildly. 　　Teabing spun around and aimed the pistol over the seat. \"I can\u0027t imagine your complaint, sir. Youtrespassed in my home and planted a nasty welt on the skull of a dear friend. I would be wellwithin my rights to shoot you right now and leave you to rot in the woods.\"The monk fell silent. 　　\"Are you sure we should have brought him?\" Langdon asked. 　　\"Bloody well positive!\" Teabing exclaimed. \"You\u0027re wanted for murder, Robert. This scoundrel isyour ticket to freedom. The police apparently want you badly enough to have tailed you to myhome.\"\"My fault,\" Sophie said. \"The armored car probably had a transmitter.\"\"Not the point,\" Teabing said. \"I\u0027m not surprised the police found you, but I am surprised that thisOpus Dei character found you. From all you\u0027ve told me, I can\u0027t imagine how this man could havetailed you to my home unless he had a contact either within the Judicial Police or within the ZurichDepository.\"Langdon considered it. Bezu Fache certainly seemed intent on finding a scapegoat for tonight\u0027smurders. And Vernet had turned on them rather suddenly, although considering Langdon wasbeing charged with four murders, the banker\u0027s change of heart seemed understandable. 　　\"This monk is not working alone, Robert,\" Teabing said, \"and until you learn who is behind all this,you both are in danger. The good news, my friend, is that you are now in the position of power. 　　This monster behind me holds that information, and whoever is pulling his strings has got to bequite nervous right now.\"Rémy was picking up speed, getting comfortable with the trail. They splashed through some water,climbed a small rise, and began descending again. 　　\"Robert, could you be so kind as to hand me that phone?\" Teabing pointed to the car phone on thedash. Langdon handed it back, and Teabing dialed a number. He waited for a very long time beforesomeone answered. \"Richard? Did I wake you? Of course, I did. Silly question. I\u0027m sorry. I have asmall problem. I\u0027m feeling a bit off. Rémy and I need to pop up to the Isles for my treatments. 　　Well, right away, actually. Sorry for the short notice. Can you have Elizabeth ready in about twentyminutes? I know, do the best you can. See you shortly.\" He hung up. 　　\"Elizabeth?\" Langdon said. 　　\"My plane. She cost me a Queen\u0027s ransom.\"Langdon turned full around and looked at him. 　　\"What?\" Teabing demanded. \"You two can\u0027t expect to stay in France with the entire Judicial Policeafter you. London will be much safer.\"Sophie had turned to Teabing as well. \"You think we should leave the country?\"\"My friends, I am far more influential in the civilized world than here in France. Furthermore, theGrail is believed to be in Great Britain. If we unlock the keystone, I am certain we will discover amap that indicates we have moved in the proper direction.\"\"You\u0027re running a big risk,\" Sophie said, \"by helping us. You won\u0027t make any friends with theFrench police.\"Teabing gave a wave of disgust. \"I am finished with France. I moved here to find the keystone. 　　That work is now done. I shan\u0027t care if I ever again see Chateau Villette.\"Sophie sounded uncertain. \"How will we get through airport security?\"Teabing chuckled. \"I fly from Le Bourget—an executive airfield not far from here. French doctorsmake me nervous, so every fortnight, I fly north to take my treatments in England. I pay for certainspecial privileges at both ends. Once we\u0027re airborne, you can make a decision as to whether or notyou\u0027d like someone from the U.S. Embassy to meet us.\"Langdon suddenly didn\u0027t want anything to do with the embassy. All he could think of was thekeystone, the inscription, and whether it would all lead to the Grail. He wondered if Teabing wasright about Britain. Admittedly most modern legends placed the Grail somewhere in the UnitedKingdom. Even King Arthur\u0027s mythical, Grail-rich Isle of Avalon was now believed to be noneother than Glastonbury, England. Wherever the Grail lay, Langdon never imagined he wouldactually be looking for it. The Sangreal documents. The true history of Jesus Christ. The tomb ofMary Magdalene. He suddenly felt as if he were living in some kind of limbo tonight... a bubblewhere the real world could not reach him. 　　\"Sir?\" Rémy said. \"Are you truly thinking of returning to England for good?\"\"Rémy, you needn\u0027t worry,\" Teabing assured. \"Just because I am returning to the Queen\u0027s realmdoes not mean I intend to subject my palate to bangers and mash for the rest of my days. I expectyou will join me there permanently. I\u0027m planning to buy a splendid villa in Devonshire, and we\u0027llhave all your things shipped up immediately. An adventure, Rémy. I say, an adventure!\"Langdon had to smile. As Teabing railed on about his plans for a triumphant return to Britain,Langdon felt himself caught up in the man\u0027s infectious enthusiasm. 　　Gazing absently out the window, Langdon watched the woods passing by, ghostly pale in theyellow blush of the fog lights. The side mirror was tipped inward, brushed askew by branches, andLangdon saw the reflection of Sophie sitting quietly in the back seat. He watched her for a longwhile and felt an unexpected upwelling of contentment. Despite his troubles tonight, Langdon wasthankful to have landed in such good company. 　　After several minutes, as if suddenly sensing his eyes on her, Sophie leaned forward and put herhands on his shoulders, giving him a quick rub. \"You okay?\"\"Yeah,\" Langdon said. \"Somehow.\"Sophie sat back in her seat, and Langdon saw a quiet smile cross her lips. He realized that he toowas now grinning. 　　Wedged in the back of the Range Rover, Silas could barely breathe. His arms were wrenchedbackward and heavily lashed to his ankles with kitchen twine and duct tape. Every bump in theroad sent pain shooting through his twisted shoulders. At least his captors had removed the cilice. 　　Unable to inhale through the strip of tape over his mouth, he could only breathe through hisnostrils, which were slowly clogging up due to the dusty rear cargo area into which he had beencrammed. He began coughing. 　　\"I think he\u0027s choking,\" the French driver said, sounding concerned. 　　The British man who had struck Silas with his crutch now turned and peered over the seat,frowning coldly at Silas. \"Fortunately for you, we British judge man\u0027s civility not by hiscompassion for his friends, but by his compassion for his enemies.\" The Brit reached down andgrabbed the duct tape on Silas\u0027s mouth. In one fast motion, he tore it off. 　　Silas felt as if his lips had just caught fire, but the air pouring into his lungs was sent from God. 　　\"Whom do you work for?\" the British man demanded. 　　\"I do the work of God,\" Silas spat back through the pain in his jaw where the woman had kickedhim. 　　\"You belong to Opus Dei,\" the man said. It was not a question. 　　\"You know nothing of who I am.\"\"Why does Opus Dei want the keystone?\"Silas had no intention of answering. The keystone was the link to the Holy Grail, and the HolyGrail was the key to protecting the faith. 　　I do the work of God. The Way is in peril. 　　Now, in the Range Rover, struggling against his bonds, Silas feared he had failed the Teacher andthe bishop forever. He had no way even to contact them and tell them the terrible turn of events. 　　My captors have the keystone! They will reach the Grail before we do! In the stifling darkness,Silas prayed. He let the pain of his body fuel his supplications. 　　A miracle, Lord. I need a miracle. Silas had no way of knowing that hours from now, he would getone. 　　\"Robert?\" Sophie was still watching him. \"A funny look just crossed your face.\"Langdon glanced back at her, realizing his jaw was firmly set and his heart was racing. Anincredible notion had just occurred to him. Could it really be that simple an explanation? \"I need touse your cell phone, Sophie.\"\"Now?\"\"I think I just figured something out.\"\"What?\"\"I\u0027ll tell you in a minute. I need your phone.\"Sophie looked wary. \"I doubt Fache is tracing, but keep it under a minute just in case.\" She gavehim her phone. 　　\"How do I dial the States?\"\"You need to reverse the charges. My service doesn\u0027t cover transatlantic.\"Langdon dialed zero, knowing that the next sixty seconds might answer a question that had beenpuzzling him all night. \"陆虎揽胜\"车采用了旧金山软件制造商\"黑珍珠\"公司开发的Java 技术。它有四个轮子，一台标准传送器，几盏高能量的聚丙烯灯，一盏后聚光灯，方向盘则安放在车子的右边。 兰登很高兴不是他在开车。 提彬的仆人雷米，按照主人的吩咐，正在做一项能给人留下深刻印象的工作。他驾着车，穿过维莱特庄园后面月光笼罩的田野。他没有打开车的头灯，此刻他已经翻过了一座小山，正顺着一道斜坡而下，因而离他们刚才所停留的房子越来越远了。他似乎正朝着远处影影绰绰、凹凸不平而又草木繁盛的远处树林驶去。 兰登将拱心石抱在怀中，从座椅上转过身来，注视着坐在后座的提彬与索菲两人。 \"罗伯特，你的头怎么样了？\"索菲关切地问道。 兰登勉强苦笑了一下：\"谢谢，比刚才要好得多啦。\"事实上，他正被疼痛折磨得半死。 坐在她身边的提彬，回头瞥了那名被五花大绑并被堵上嘴的修道士一眼，他正躺在最末一排座位后面专供存放行李之用的巴掌大的一块地方。提彬将那位修道士的枪放在膝盖上，那神情犹如某张旧照片中的英国历险者踩在捕获的猎物上摆出的那种酷酷的模样。 \"罗伯特，我真高兴你今晚突然跑到我家来。\"提彬咧着嘴，笑了笑，仿佛这些年来，平生第一次感到如此的快活。 \"雷，很抱歉是我连累了你。\" \"咳，行了，为这个机会的到来，我已经等了一辈子啦。\"提彬从兰登的肩膀上看过去，望着挡风玻璃外面灌木丛林投下的长长的暗影。突然，他从后面拍了拍雷米的肩，轻声叮嘱：\"记住，刹车时别开灯，万一刹车，就动用紧急刹车设备。我想再往树林里头开进一点。我们没理由冒险，让他们从房子里看见我们。\" 雷米依着车的惯性，缓缓移动，驾着那辆\"陆虎揽胜\"车在灌木丛林中闯出一条路来。 然后车子猛然冲上一条杂树丛生的小路，于是车上方的树木，几乎立刻就将月光挡住了。 我什么也看不见啊，兰登心想。他欠起身子想看看前面有些什么东西，然而外面漆黑一团。树枝摩擦着左侧的车身，于是雷米掉转车头，开往另一个方向。终于，他好歹将车身摆正了一些，亦步亦趋地往前行驶了大约三十码的距离。 \"雷米，你干得真棒！\"提彬夸道：\"这应该够了吧。罗伯特，你能不能按一按那边孔塞下面的蓝色小按钮？你看到了没有？\" 兰登找到按钮，便按了下去。 一束黄色的亮光，顿时无声地扩散开来，照着他们的前方。小路两边稠密的丛林依稀可辨。兰登意识到这是晨雾散发出来的亮光。这些光线，足以使他们能够继续往前赶路了，而且由于他们已经深入到树林里面，因此也就用不着担心被别人看见。 \"好啦，雷米。\"提彬快活地喊道。\"光线亮着呢。现在，我们的小命就全掌握在你手上了。\"\"那我们去哪里呢？\"索菲冷不防地问道。 \"这条通往森林的小路，大约有三公里长。我们抄庄园的近路，然后再往北走。只要不遇上死水潭或者倒下来的树什么的，我们就可以安然无恙地把车开到五号高速公路上。\"安然无恙？兰登可不这么想。他把视线投到膝盖上，拱心石安稳地躺在他膝盖上的木盒子里。那朵镶嵌在盖子上的玫瑰，被置于后面适当的位置。尽管他的头脑混沌一片，然而他还是急于想再次把镶嵌在盖子上的东西拿下来，以便能更仔细地将下面的雕饰研究一番。他打开盖子，举了起来。这时，提彬从身后将手搭在他的肩膀上。 \"耐心点，罗伯特。道路崎岖不平，天色又这么黑，万一我们把它弄坏，那就只能祈求上帝的保佑了。这种文字，要是你在光线里都认不出来，那在黑暗中就更不用说了。我们还是专心赶路吧，你看怎样？更何况你即使要看，也用不着这么猴急。\"兰登知道提彬说得对，于是他点了点头，重新将盒子盖上。 后面的修道士此刻正在呻吟，胡乱撕扯着绑在他身上的东西，突然，他的双脚疯狂的乱蹬乱踢。 提彬迅速掉过身子，俯在座位上用手枪径直瞄准了修道士。\"阁下，我看你没什么好抱怨的了。你不但非法闯进我家，而且还在我朋友的头上敲了个洞。我现在完全有权一枪毙了你，任由你的尸骨烂在这树林里。\"修道士顿时安静下来。 \"你确定我们必须带上他吗？\"兰登问道。 \"那还用说，罗伯特，你被指控犯有谋杀罪，而这家伙就是让你通向自由的通行证。很明显，警察跟踪你跑到我家就是冲你来的。\"提彬大声说。 \"这都是我的错。这辆装甲车可能有传话机对吧？\" \"话不能这样说。\"提彬接口说：\"警方找到你们，我丝毫不觉得有什么奇怪。让我奇怪的是这个天主事工会的家伙竟找上门来。从你们告诉我的情况来看，我无法想象他怎能跟着你跑到我家，除非他跟警察署或者苏黎世储蓄银行的工作人员有往来。\"兰登考虑了片刻。贝祖。法希一定是在蓄意为今晚的谋杀事件找一只替罪羊。不过，韦尔内突然将攻击的矛头指向他们--尽管考虑到兰登被指控犯有四桩谋杀案在身，这位银行家态度的转变似乎是可以理解的。 \"罗伯特，这位修道士可不是单枪匹马行事。而且，在你们知道谁是幕后操纵者之前，你们两人目前的处境都很危险，好在你们现在取得了主动权。躺在我后面的那个混蛋，就知道其中的内幕。现在，那个躲在幕后的操纵者肯定很紧张呢。\"雷米加快了车速，这样，车在小路上开得更平稳了。他们趟过一些水洼地，朝山坡上驶了一段距离，然后又开始走下坡路。 \"罗伯特，你能不能把电话递给我？\"提彬指指放在仪器板上的电话。于是兰登把电话往后递了过去。提彬拨了一个号码，但他等了很久才有人接电话。\"是理查德吗？我吵醒你了吧？我当然吵醒了你啦。我怎么问这么愚蠢的问题？！对不起，有件小事我想求你帮忙。我觉得情况有点不正常，我和雷米得赶快坐飞机到英国去接受治疗。好吧，你马上过来。我很抱歉没时间跟你详细解释。你能不能在大约二十分钟之内把我的\"伊丽莎白\"准备好？我知道了，快点，呆会儿见。\"说完他就把电话挂了。 \"\"伊丽莎白\"？\"兰登问道。 \"是我飞机的名字，它花去了我一半家产呢。\" 兰登将整个身子转了过去，两眼紧盯着他。 \"怎么啦？\"提彬询问道：\"你们两个该不会留在法国，让警察署在后面穷追不舍吧？要知道比起法国来，伦敦要安全的多啦。\"索菲也转过身，面对着他：\"你是说要我们离开这个国家？\" \"朋友们，我在伦敦的上流社会的影响比我在巴黎更大。更何况，大家都认为圣杯是在英国。如果我们能打开拱心石，我敢保证我们会找到一张地图，它会告诉我们选择的方向是对的。\"\"你是在冒很大的风险帮我们呢。你该不会跟法国警方套上交情吧？\"索菲说。 提彬不满的摆了摆手。\"我在法国生活的岁月将结束了。我之所以搬到法国来，原本就是想寻找拱心石，但现在任务已经完成，我也就不在乎还能不能见到维莱特庄园了。\"索菲的语气里有些不安：\"我们怎样才能通过机场的安全检查呢？\" 提彬呵呵的笑起来。\"我是从离这里不远的布尔歇机场坐飞机来的。法国的医生们总是搞得我很紧张，所以每隔两个星期，我都要坐飞机往北飞到英国去接受治疗。结果呢，我总得为享受某些特别的优惠而两头付钱。等我们登上机，你就可以做出决定，比如说愿不愿意去见一位来自美国大使馆的人。\"突然，兰登不想与美国大使馆搭上任何关系，他一心一意的想着拱心石、碑文，以及它们能否帮他们找到圣杯。他在想，提彬提到关于英国方面的情况是不是真的。必须承认，现代传说大都声称圣杯就在英国的某个地方，甚至还有人相信，亚瑟王传说中虚构的极乐世界阿瓦隆岛就在今天英格兰的格拉斯顿伯里。先不管圣杯在哪里，兰登从没想过有朝一日会真地去寻找它。《圣杯文献》、《耶稣基督正传》、《抹大拉的玛利亚之墓》。他突然觉得，今天晚上他似乎生活在地狱的边缘……生活在现实世界无法企及的空想里。 \"阁下。\"雷米问道：\"你真的想永远回到英格兰去吗？\" \"雷米，你别担心。\"提彬肯定地说：\"我即使回到女王管辖的领土，也并不意味着在今后的日子里，我会将我的口味仅仅局限在香肠和马铃薯上。我希望你能长久的跟我呆在那里。我打算在德文郡买一栋华美的别墅，然后马上把你所有的东西航运过去。这是在冒险，雷米。你听我说，我们是在冒险。\"兰登勉强地笑了。提彬在一边大谈特谈他衣锦还乡回英国后的各种计划，而兰登也觉得，自己已经被这个男人富有感染力的热情所感染了。 兰登心不在焉地望着窗外，注视着向后退去的树林，在黄红色的夜雾里，散发出幽灵般惨淡的光。车前的镜子被压得向里倾斜，树枝儿从车身擦边而过，弄得它歪歪斜斜的。 兰登从镜子里看到索菲安静的坐在后排的座位上，他注视了她好一会儿，心中陡然升腾起一股无比的满足感。尽管今晚遇到了一些麻烦，兰登还是很感谢一路上有这么好的朋友相伴。 过了几分钟，索菲似乎突然发觉他在盯着她，便俯身向前，将手放在他的肩膀上，飞快地捏了一下。\"你没事吧？\" \"嗯，还行。\"兰登回应道。 索菲坐回到座位上，兰登看到她的嘴角掠过一丝恬静的微笑，他发觉自己也张嘴笑了起来。 塞拉斯被塞在\"陆虎揽胜\"车的后面，几乎难以呼吸。他的胳膊被人扭向后面，并被人用厨房里的麻绳以及电缆线重重地鞭打过，就连他的脚踝也不放过。车子在路上每颠簸一下，他那扭曲的肩膀就痛的半死。好在至少他的征服者将他身上穿的粗布衣服脱去了。他的嘴巴由于被堵了个严严实实而无法吸气，所以只能通过鼻孔呼吸。然而他的鼻孔也被慢慢地堵上了，因为他被塞在满是尘埃的车后存货区里。于是他开始咳嗽起来。 \"我看他在咳嗽呢。\"法国司机的语气中透出了几分关切。 这个刚才用拐杖袭击了塞拉斯的英国人，此刻转过身子，趴在座位上，双眉紧锁，冷冷地打量着他。\"你够走运的了。我们英国人衡量一个人有没有教养，不是看他对朋友有无关切之情，而是看他对敌人是否有怜悯之心。\"英国人一边说，一边伸下手去，猛地将堵在塞拉斯嘴里的电缆线拔出来，很快地撕了个粉碎。 塞拉斯感觉双唇像着了火，不过，沁人肺腑的空气，就是上帝给他最好的恩赐。 \"你到底是在为谁卖命？\"英国人质问道。 \"我在为上帝。\"塞拉斯忍住疼痛说--因为那女人才踢了他的下巴，并向后面吐了一口唾沫。 \"你是天主事工会的人对吧？\"英国人明知故问。 \"你别想从我嘴里得到什么。\" \"天主事工会为什么要寻找拱心石？\" 塞拉斯不想回答，拱心石是找到圣杯的重要一环，而后者又是使信仰不至于遭到亵渎的关键。 我为上帝效劳。世道却在沦落。 此时，塞拉斯躺在\"陆虎揽胜\"车里，竭力想挣脱强加在他身上的束缚，他担心自己会永远辜负教主以及主教的委托。他现在甚至没有任何办法与他们取得联系，向他们汇报这突如其来发生的可怕的转折性事件。拱心石现已落入敌人之手。他们将赶在我们之前找到圣杯！塞拉斯在令人窒息的黑暗中祈祷。他想通过肉体的痛苦来增强他祈祷的动力。 上帝啊，给我奇迹吧，我现在需要奇迹。虽然塞拉斯无从知道何时会有奇迹出现，但他相信奇迹终究会出现。 \"罗伯特？\"索菲还在望着他：\"刚才你脸上的神情真逗。\" 兰登回头瞥了她一眼，意识到他的表情过于严肃，而他的内心其实却在翻江倒海。他的海中刚刚闪过一个令人难以置信的念头。真会有这么简单的解释吗？\"索菲，借你的手机给我用用。\"\"你是说现在？\" \"是的，我刚想到了一些东西。\" \"是什么？\" \"待会儿再告诉你。你先把手机给我。\" 索菲面露警惕的神色。\"我怀疑法希在跟踪我们，只是以防万一而暂时忍耐罢了。\" 她把手机递给了他。 \"我要拨美国的电话号码，该怎么拨？\" \"那你恐怕得拨打对方付费电话，我的手机不提供越洋电话服务。\" 兰登先拨了个零，他知道，接下来的这一分钟将会帮他解答困扰了他整个晚上的所有问题。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8620.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci
