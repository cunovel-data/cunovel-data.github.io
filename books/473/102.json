{"id":30242,"no":102,"title":"Chapter 101","content":"Robert Langdon stood beneath the lofty cupola of the deserted Chapter House and stared into thebarrel of Leigh Teabing\u0027s gun.\n 　　Robert, are you with me, or against me? The Royal Historian\u0027s words echoed in the silence ofLangdon\u0027s mind.\n 　　There was no viable response, Langdon knew. Answer yes, and he would be selling out Sophie.\n 　　Answer no, and Teabing would have no choice but to kill them both.\n 　　Langdon\u0027s years in the classroom had not imbued him with any skills relevant to handlingconfrontations at gunpoint, but the classroom had taught him something about answeringparadoxical questions. When a question has no correct answer, there is only one honest response.\n 　　The gray area between yes and no.\n 　　Silence.\n 　　Staring at the cryptex in his hands, Langdon chose simply to walk away.\n 　　Without ever lifting his eyes, he stepped backward, out into the room\u0027s vast empty spaces. Neutralground. He hoped his focus on the cryptex signaled Teabing that collaboration might be an option,and that his silence signaled Sophie he had not abandoned her.\n 　　All the while buying time to think.\n 　　The act of thinking, Langdon suspected, was exactly what Teabing wanted him to do. That\u0027s whyhe handed me the cryptex. So I could feel the weight of my decision. The British historian hoped thetouch of the Grand Master\u0027s cryptex would make Langdon fully grasp the magnitude of itscontents, coaxing his academic curiosity to overwhelm all else, forcing him to realize that failure tounlock the keystone would mean the loss of history itself.\n 　　With Sophie at gunpoint across the room, Langdon feared that discovering the cryptex\u0027s elusivepassword would be his only remaining hope of bartering her release. If I can free the map, Teabingwill negotiate. Forcing his mind to this critical task, Langdon moved slowly toward the farwindows... allowing his mind to fill with the numerous astronomical images on Newton\u0027s tomb.\n 　　You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.\n 　　It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb.\n 　　Turning his back to the others, he walked toward the towering windows, searching for anyinspiration in their stained-glass mosaics. There was none.\n 　　Place yourself in Saunière\u0027s mind, he urged, gazing outward now into College Garden. What wouldhe believe is the orb that ought be on Newton\u0027s tomb? Images of stars, comets, and planetstwinkled in the falling rain, but Langdon ignored them. Saunière was not a man of science. He wasa man of humanity, of art, of history. The sacred feminine... the chalice... the Rose... the banishedMary Magdalene... the decline of the goddess... the Holy Grail.\n 　　Legend had always portrayed the Grail as a cruel mistress, dancing in the shadows just out of sight,whispering in your ear, luring you one more step and then evaporating into the mist.\n 　　Gazing out at the rustling trees of College Garden, Langdon sensed her playful presence. The signswere everywhere. Like a taunting silhouette emerging from the fog, the branches of Britain\u0027s oldestapple tree burgeoned with five-petaled blossoms, all glistening like Venus. The goddess was in thegarden now. She was dancing in the rain, singing songs of the ages, peeking out from behind thebud-filled branches as if to remind Langdon that the fruit of knowledge was growing just beyondhis reach.\n 　　Across the room, Sir Leigh Teabing watched with confidence as Langdon gazed out the window asif under a spell.\n 　　Exactly as I hoped, Teabing thought. He will come around.\n 　　For some time now, Teabing had suspected Langdon might hold the key to the Grail. It was nocoincidence that Teabing launched his plan into action on the same night Langdon was scheduledto meet Jacques Saunière. Listening in on the curator, Teabing was certain the man\u0027s eagerness tomeet privately with Langdon could mean only one thing. Langdon\u0027s mysterious manuscript hastouched a nerve with the Priory.\n 　　Langdon has stumbled onto a truth, and Saunière fears its release. Teabing felt certain the GrandMaster was summoning Langdon to silence him.\n 　　The Truth has been silenced long enough!\n 　　Teabing knew he had to act quickly. Silas\u0027s attack would accomplish two goals. It would preventSaunière from persuading Langdon to keep quiet, and it would ensure that once the keystone wasin Teabing\u0027s hands, Langdon would be in Paris for recruitment should Teabing need him.\n 　　Arranging the fatal meeting between Saunière and Silas had been almost too easy. I had insideinformation about Saunière\u0027s deepest fears. Yesterday afternoon, Silas had phoned the curator andposed as a distraught priest. \"Monsieur Saunière, forgive me, I must speak to you at once. I shouldnever breach the sanctity of the confessional, but in this case, I feel I must. I just took confessionfrom a man who claimed to have murdered members of your family.\"Saunière\u0027s response was startled but wary. \"My family died in an accident. The police report wasconclusive.\"\"Yes, a car accident,\" Silas said, baiting the hook. \"The man I spoke to said he forced their car offthe road into a river.\"Saunière fell silent.\n 　　\"Monsieur Saunière, I would never have phoned you directly except this man made a commentwhich makes me now fear for your safety.\" He paused. \"The man also mentioned yourgranddaughter, Sophie.\"The mention of Sophie\u0027s name had been the catalyst. The curator leapt into action. He ordered Silasto come see him immediately in the safest location Saunière knew—his Louvre office. Then hephoned Sophie to warn her she might be in danger. Drinks with Robert Langdon were instantlyabandoned.\n 　　Now, with Langdon separated from Sophie on the far side of the room, Teabing sensed he hadsuccessfully alienated the two companions from one another. Sophie Neveu remained defiant, butLangdon clearly saw the larger picture. He was trying to figure out the password. He understandsthe importance of finding the Grail and releasing her from bondage.\n 　　\"He won\u0027t open it for you,\" Sophie said coldly. \"Even if he can.\"Teabing was glancing at Langdon as he held the gun on Sophie. He was fairly certain now he wasgoing to have to use the weapon. Although the idea troubled him, he knew he would not hesitate ifit came to that. I have given her every opportunity to do the right thing. The Grail is bigger thanany one of us.\n 　　At that moment, Langdon turned from the window. \"The tomb...\" he said suddenly, facing themwith a faint glimmer of hope in his eyes. \"I know where to look on Newton\u0027s tomb. Yes, I think Ican find the password!\"Teabing\u0027s heart soared. \"Where, Robert? Tell me!\"Sophie sounded horrified. \"Robert, no! You\u0027re not going to help him, are you?\"Langdon approached with a resolute stride, holding the cryptex before him. \"No,\" he said, his eyeshardening as he turned to Leigh. \"Not until he lets you go.\"Teabing\u0027s optimism darkened. \"We are so close, Robert. Don\u0027t you dare start playing games withme!\"\"No games,\" Langdon said. \"Let her go. Then I\u0027ll take you to Newton\u0027s tomb. We\u0027ll open thecryptex together.\"\"I\u0027m not going anywhere,\" Sophie declared, her eyes narrowing with rage. \"That cryptex was givento me by my grandfather. It is not yours to open.\"Langdon wheeled, looking fearful. \"Sophie, please! You\u0027re in danger. I\u0027m trying to help you!\"\"How? By unveiling the secret my grandfather died trying to protect? He trusted you, Robert. Itrusted you!\"Langdon\u0027s blue eyes showed panic now, and Teabing could not help but smile to see the two ofthem working against one another. Langdon\u0027s attempts to be gallant were more pathetic thananything. On the verge of unveiling one of history\u0027s greatest secrets, and he troubles himself with awoman who has proven herself unworthy of the quest.\n 　　\"Sophie,\" Langdon pleaded. \"Please... you must leave.\"She shook her head. \"Not unless you either hand me the cryptex or smash it on the floor.\"\"What?\" Langdon gasped.\n 　　\"Robert, my grandfather would prefer his secret lost forever than see it in the hands of hismurderer.\" Sophie\u0027s eyes looked as if they would well with tears, but they did not. She stareddirectly back at Teabing. \"Shoot me if you have to. I am not leaving my grandfather\u0027s legacy inyour hands.\"Very well. Teabing aimed the weapon.\n 　　\"No!\" Langdon shouted, raising his arm and suspending the cryptex precariously over the hardstone floor. \"Leigh, if you even think about it, I will drop this.\"Teabing laughed. \"That bluff worked on Rémy. Not on me. I know you better than that.\"\"Do you, Leigh?\"Yes I do. Your poker face needs work, my friend. It took me several seconds, but I can see now thatyou are lying. You have no idea where on Newton\u0027s tomb the answer lies. \"Truly, Robert? Youknow where on the tomb to look?\"\"I do.\"The falter in Langdon\u0027s eyes was fleeting but Leigh caught it. There was a lie there. A desperate,pathetic ploy to save Sophie. Teabing felt a profound disappointment in Robert Langdon.\n 　　I am a lone knight, surrounded by unworthy souls. And I will have to decipher the keystone on myown.\n 　　Langdon and Neveu were nothing but a threat to Teabing now... and to the Grail. As painful as thesolution was going to be, he knew he could carry it out with a clean conscience. The only challengewould be to persuade Langdon to set down the keystone so Teabing could safely end this charade.\n 　　\"A show of faith,\" Teabing said, lowering the gun from Sophie. \"Set down the keystone, and we\u0027lltalk.\"Langdon knew his lie had failed.\n 　　He could see the dark resolve in Teabing\u0027s face and knew the moment was upon them. When I setthis down, he will kill us both. Even without looking at Sophie, he could hear her heart beseechinghim in silent desperation. Robert, this man is not worthy of the Grail. Please do not place it in hishands. No matter what the cost.\n 　　Langdon had already made his decision several minutes ago, while standing alone at the windowoverlooking College Garden.\n 　　Protect Sophie.\n 　　Protect the Grail.\n 　　Langdon had almost shouted out in desperation. But I cannot see how!\n 　　The stark moments of disillusionment had brought with them a clarity unlike any he had ever felt.\n 　　The Truth is right before your eyes, Robert. He knew not from where the epiphany came. The Grailis not mocking you, she is calling out to a worthy soul.\n 　　Now, bowing down like a subject several yards in front of Leigh Teabing, Langdon lowered thecryptex to within inches of the stone floor.\n 　　\"Yes, Robert,\" Teabing whispered, aiming the gun at him. \"Set it down.\"Langdon\u0027s eyes moved heavenward, up into the gaping void of the Chapter House cupola.\n 　　Crouching lower, Langdon lowered his gaze to Teabing\u0027s gun, aimed directly at him.\n 　　\"I\u0027m sorry, Leigh.\"In one fluid motion, Langdon leapt up, swinging his arm skyward, launching the cryptex straightup toward the dome above.\n 　　Leigh Teabing did not feel his finger pull the trigger, but the Medusa discharged with a thunderingcrash. Langdon\u0027s crouched form was now vertical, almost airborne, and the bullet exploded in thefloor near Langdon\u0027s feet. Half of Teabing\u0027s brain attempted to adjust his aim and fire again in rage,but the more powerful half dragged his eyes upward into the cupola.\n 　　The keystone!\n 　　Time seemed to freeze, morphing into a slow-motion dream as Teabing\u0027s entire world became theairborne keystone. He watched it rise to the apex of its climb... hovering for a moment in the void...\n 　　and then tumbling downward, end over end, back toward the stone floor.\n 　　All of Teabing\u0027s hopes and dreams were plummeting toward earth. It cannot strike the floor! I canreach it! Teabing\u0027s body reacted on instinct. He released the gun and heaved himself forward,dropping his crutches as he reached out with his soft, manicured hands. Stretching his arms andfingers, he snatched the keystone from midair.\n 　　Falling forward with the keystone victoriously clutched in his hand, Teabing knew he was fallingtoo fast. With nothing to break his fall, his outstretched arms hit first, and the cryptex collided hardwith the floor.\n 　　There was a sickening crunch of glass within.\n 　　For a full second, Teabing did not breathe. Lying there outstretched on the cold floor, staring thelength of his outstretched arms at the marble cylinder in his bare palms, he implored the glass vialinside to hold. Then the acrid tang of vinegar cut the air, and Teabing felt the cool liquid flowingout through the dials onto his palm.\n 　　Wild panic gripped him. NO! The vinegar was streaming now, and Teabing pictured the papyrusdissolving within. Robert, you fool! The secret is lost!\n 　　Teabing felt himself sobbing uncontrollably. The Grail is gone. Everything destroyed. Shudderingin disbelief over Langdon\u0027s actions, Teabing tried to force the cylinder apart, longing to catch afleeting glimpse of history before it dissolved forever. To his shock, as he pulled the ends of thekeystone, the cylinder separated.\n 　　He gasped and peered inside. It was empty except for shards of wet glass. No dissolving papyrus.\n 　　Teabing rolled over and looked up at Langdon. Sophie stood beside him, aiming the gun down atTeabing.\n 　　Bewildered, Teabing looked back at the keystone and saw it. The dials were no longer at random.\n 　　They spelled a five-letter word: APPLE.\n 　　\"The orb from which Eve partook,\" Langdon said coolly, \"incurring the Holy wrath of God.\n 　　Original sin. The symbol of the fall of the sacred feminine.\"Teabing felt the truth come crashing down on him in excruciating austerity. The orb that ought beon Newton\u0027s tomb could be none other than the Rosy apple that fell from heaven, struck Newton onthe head, and inspired his life\u0027s work. His labor\u0027s fruit! The Rosy flesh with a seeded womb!\n 　　\"Robert,\" Teabing stammered, overwhelmed. \"You opened it. Where... is the map?\"Without blinking, Langdon reached into the breast pocket of his tweed coat and carefully extracteda delicate rolled papyrus. Only a few yards from where Teabing lay, Langdon unrolled the scrolland looked at it. After a long moment, a knowing smile crossed Langdon\u0027s face.\n 　　He knows! Teabing\u0027s heart craved that knowledge. His life\u0027s dream was right in front of him. \"Tellme!\" Teabing demanded. \"Please! Oh God, please! It\u0027s not too late!\"As the sound of heavy footsteps thundered down the hall toward the Chapter House, Langdonquietly rolled the papyrus and slipped it back in his pocket.\n 　　\"No!\" Teabing cried out, trying in vain to stand.\n 　　When the doors burst open, Bezu Fache entered like a bull into a ring, his feral eyes scanning,finding his target—Leigh Teabing—helpless on the floor. Exhaling in relief, Fache holstered hisManurhin sidearm and turned to Sophie. \"Agent Neveu, I am relieved you and Mr. Langdon aresafe. You should have come in when I asked.\"The British police entered on Fache\u0027s heels, seizing the anguished prisoner and placing him inhandcuffs.\n 　　Sophie seemed stunned to see Fache. \"How did you find us?\"Fache pointed to Teabing. \"He made the mistake of showing his ID when he entered the abbey.\n 　　The guards heard a police broadcast about our search for him.\"\"It\u0027s in Langdon\u0027s pocket!\" Teabing was screaming like a madman. \"The map to the Holy Grail!\"As they hoisted Teabing and carried him out, he threw back his head and howled. \"Robert! Tell mewhere it\u0027s hidden!\"As Teabing passed, Langdon looked him in the eye. \"Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh. Youtaught me that.\"\n 罗伯特。兰登立在冷冷清清的牧师会礼堂庄严肃穆的圆屋顶下，眼睛定定地看着提彬握在手中的枪。\n \"罗伯特，你到底是跟我呢，还是不跟我？\"这位皇家学会的历史学家的话还在兰登寂静的脑海里回荡。\n 兰登知道，他绝不可能给出什么行得通的答案。如果他答应提彬，那无异于出卖了索菲。而如果他严辞拒绝，那提彬除了将他们杀死，将别无选择。\n 虽说兰登在学校里呆过多年，但他毕竟没在课堂上学过什么如何在枪口的威胁下应付冲突的技巧，不过学校倒是教会了他如何提供一些似是而非的答案。当一个问题没有正确的答案时，那就只有如实地作出反应了。\n 兰登徘徊在\"是\"与\"否\"之间那个灰色的区间。\n 他只好选择了沉默。\n 他盯着手中的密码盒，只是选择了走开。\n 他头也不抬地向后退去，进入到大厅里空旷的地带。这可是中立地带呢。他希望他对密码盒的关注能给提彬一个暗示，也许合作不失为一个理性的选择；但同时，他也希望他的沉默，会让索菲明白他并没将她抛弃。\n 我所做的一切都是为了多争取一点考虑的时间啊。\n 兰登私下里怀疑，或许花点时间考虑，也正是提彬要他做的事情呢。所以他才将密码盒给我，这样好让我感觉到做出决定的分量。这位英国皇家历史学家，希望通过让兰登实实在在地触摸到大师留下的密码盒，能让他完全领会到里面的东西对他们有多重要，从而激发他对学术的好奇心，并使他认识到：如果他不能将拱心石打开，将意味着给历史本身带来巨大的损失。\n 在大厅对面，索菲仍处在枪口的威胁之下。兰登担心，找到密码盒里尚未破译的密码，恐怕将是他借此解救她的唯一希望了。如果我能解读这张地图，那么提彬就愿意跟我讨价还价。兰登将整个心思都用在这项重要的任务上，他慢慢踱着步子，走到更远的窗前……任凭他的头脑塞满了牛顿墓上众多的天体形状。\n 你们寻找的圆球，本应在这位骑士的墓里。\n 它道破了玫瑰般肌肤与受孕子宫的秘密。\n 兰登转身背对着其他人，向那些巨大的窗户走去，他想在墙上的彩色拼花玻璃里寻找灵感的火花，然而却一无所获。\n 站在索尼埃的角度去想一想吧，他这样敦促自己。他把目光投向外面的学院花园。索尼埃认为应该将什么样的球形物放入牛顿爵士的坟墓里呢？纷飞的雨中闪过无数恒星、彗星以及行星的形象，然而兰登并没在意它们。索尼埃不是研究科学的学者，而是人文学家、艺术家、历史学家。神圣女性……圣餐杯……圣洁的玫瑰……被放逐的抹大拉的玛利亚……女神的衰落……以及圣杯。\n 传说中的圣杯，经常被描绘成一位残酷的女人，她在刚好让你看不见的黑暗中翩翩起舞，在你的耳边窃窃私语，诱惑着你再走近一步，最后消失在迷雾中。\n 兰登凝视着学院花园里那片沙沙作响的树林，觉得顽皮的她此刻就在身边。征兆无处不在，就像在迷雾里嘲弄似的凸显出来的轮廓。这些英国最古老的苹果树的树枝，开满了五朵花瓣的花，它们全都像金星一样，闪着微光。女神来到了花园。现在她正在雨中跳舞，唱着那经历不知多少世纪的歌曲。她从开满花朵的树枝后面偷偷地探出头，似乎在提醒兰登，知识的果实蓬勃生长，远远超越了他力所能学的范围。\n 在大厅的对面，雷。提彬爵士踌躇满志地望着仿佛被魔法镇住了的兰登凝视窗外。\n 果然不出所料，他会回心转意的。提彬心想。\n 一段时间以来，提彬一直怀疑兰登可能找到了开启圣杯的钥匙。就在他准备开始行动的当天晚上，兰登也安排了与雅克。索尼埃的见面，这决不是什么巧合。提彬窃听这位博物馆的馆长已有很长一段时间，他确信，这位馆长急于与兰登私下会面只能意味着一件事情--即兰登的神秘文稿触动了郇山隐修会敏感的神经，他误打误撞地触及到其中的真相，而索尼埃又害怕它被泄露出去。提彬确信这位大师把兰登叫去，就是要堵他的嘴。\n 真相已经隐藏得太久了！\n 提彬知道，他必须赶快采取行动。塞拉斯的袭击将有助于完成两个目标：一方面，它可以阻止索尼埃说服兰登保持缄默；另一方面，它也可以确保如果拱心石落人提彬的手中，一旦他需要兰登，他就会跑到巴黎随时待命。\n 安排索尼埃与塞拉斯的那次带来致命性灾难的会面实在是太容易了。我掌握了索尼埃最为之恐惧的内幕消息。昨天下午，塞拉斯打电话给这位馆长，把自己装扮成一位心烦意乱的牧师。他说：\"索尼埃先生，请你宽恕我，有些事我必须马上跟你说。我本不应该破坏忏悔室的圣洁，然而眼下这种状况，我也只好这样做了。我刚才听到有个男人在忏悔，说是他谋害了你的家人。\"索尼埃惊讶万分，但还是警惕地说：\"我的家人死于车祸。这是警方经过调查做出的结论。\"\"是的，他们是死于车祸。\"塞拉斯抛下了诱饵：\"可那人跟我说，他是故意将他们的车子撞到河里去的。\"索尼埃在电话的另一端没有作声。\n \"索尼埃先生，要不是那人说了一句让我担心你安全的话，我是不会打电话找你的。\"\n 他停了片刻，说：\"那人还提到你的孙女索菲。\"\n 索菲名字的提及，无疑起到了催化剂的作用。这位馆长立即采取行动。他让塞拉斯立刻赶到他所知道的最安全的地方--即他在卢浮宫的办公室--见他。然后又打电话给索菲，警告她可能会有危险。他原先打算与兰登喝几盅的计划也很快被取消了。\n 此刻，在大厅的另一头，兰登与索菲隔得远远的。提彬觉得已成功地将这对搭档分开了。索菲。奈芙依然不愿从命，但兰登的眼光明显就看得远了。他正努力地找寻密码。他深知找到圣杯，并使它得以从束缚中解脱出来的重要性。\n \"即使他能够找到密码，也不会帮你。\"索菲冷冷地说。\n 提彬瞥了一眼兰登，却仍没忘记将枪对准索菲。他终于明白，他必须动用手中的武器。虽然这个想法困扰着他，但他知道，如果一旦下定了决心，他是决不会犹豫的。我已给了她许多改过自新的机会，圣杯可比我们中间的任何人都更重要啊！\n 就在这时，兰登从窗户边转过身来。\"那坟墓--\"他突然面对他们说，眼中有淡淡的希望之光在闪烁。\"我知道该站在哪个角度看牛顿爵士的坟墓。是的，我想我能找到密码。\n \"提彬的心立即提到了喉咙口：\"罗伯特，在哪里？你快告诉我！\"\n 索菲似乎被吓坏了：\"罗伯特，不要！你不会帮他是不是？\"\n 兰登迈着坚定的步子，大步流星地走过来，将密码盒举到面前。\"不，\"他说，转身面对着雷。提彬，目光变得强硬起来。\"他如果不放你走，我是不会说的。\"\n 提彬的乐观情绪立刻黯淡下来：\"罗伯特，我们离得这么近。你该不是想跟我玩什么游戏吧？！\"\"谁跟你玩游戏了？\"兰登说：\"你放她走，然后我就带你去看牛顿墓，一起把密码盒打开。\"\"我哪儿也不去，\"索菲大声宣布，她愤怒地眯上眼睛。\"密码盒是我祖父给我的，你们没资格把它打开。\"兰登猛地转过身，脸色阴森可怕。\"索菲，我求你了！你现在处境很危险，我是想帮你呀！\"\"你怎么帮？你想将我祖父拼了命也要保护起来的秘密泄露出去？他相信你，罗伯特。\n 我以前也相信你呐。\"兰登蓝色的眼睛此刻流露出一丝恐惧，提彬看到他们两人作对，不由暗暗地笑了。兰登试图向一个不值得同情的女人献殷勤，这比去做其他任何事情还要让人可怜。我们马上就要揭开历史上最大的秘密，可是他竟然还在跟一个已经证明了自己不配参与这次探索的女人纠缠不休。\n \"索菲，\"兰登恳求道：\"我求你了--你必须走！\"\n 索菲摇摇头：\"我不会走的，除非你把密码盒给我，或者把它砸掉。\"\n \"你说什么？\"兰登目瞪口呆。\n \"罗伯特，我祖父宁愿看到秘密永远消失，也不愿看到它落入凶手之手。\"索菲的双眼看似充盈了泪水，其实却没有。她径直转过身，瞪着提彬，说：\"你想杀我就开枪吧。我是不会让我祖父的遗物落入你手中的。\"很好。提彬用枪对准了她。\n \"别开枪！\"兰登大声喊道，他举起胳膊，将密码盒悬在坚硬的石板上方，摆出摇摇欲坠的模样。\"雷爵士，如果你敢开枪，我就把它丢在地上。\"\n 提彬大声笑起来：\"你这样虚张声势，吓得倒雷米，可吓不倒我。我对你是再了解不过的了。\"\"是吗？\"\n \"是的，我了解。我的朋友，你需要活动活动你僵硬的脸庞。虽然浪费了我一点时间，但我还是看出来了，你在撒谎。你不知道密码藏在牛顿坟墓的哪个地方。\"\"你真的知道吗，罗伯特？你知道藏在坟墓的哪个地方吗？\"\n \"我知道。\"\n 然而兰登游移不定的眼神还是被提彬捕捉到了。他在撒谎，是为了解救索菲铤而走险玩弄的拙劣的伎俩。提彬不由对罗伯特。兰登深感失望。\n 我是位孤单的骑士，身边都是一些微不足道的人。我将不得不依靠自己，去破译开启拱心石的密码。\n 现在，罗伯特。兰登与索菲。奈芙对提彬而言除了是威胁还是威胁……而且他们的存在，对圣杯本身也是威胁。他的内心不亚于接下来寻找密码的过程那般痛苦，他知道自己可以凭良心行事。不过眼下唯一的难题，就是如何说服兰登放下拱心石，这样，提彬就可以平安无事地结束这场游戏。\n 兰登知道自己撒的谎露馅了。\n 他看到提彬露出可怕的然而坚毅的神情，他知道这样的时刻就要来临了。如果我松手把拱心石掉在地上，他就会杀死我们。他即使不看索菲，也能够让我听到她在无言地拼命向他祈求。罗伯特，这个人是不配得到圣杯的。别让它落到他的手中，不管要付出多大的代价。\n 几分钟前，兰登独自站在窗前俯视学院花园的时候，就已经拿定了主意。\n 我要保护索菲。\n 也要保护圣杯。\n 兰登差点绝望地喊出声来。可我不知道该怎么办啊！\n 就在他完全绝望之时，他的思路反倒前所未有地变得清晰起来。罗伯特，真相就在你的眼前。他也不知道是从哪里领悟来的。圣杯并未嘲弄你，它只是在呼唤能够配得上它的人。\n 于是，他像一位顺从的臣民，在雷。提彬前面几码之外的地方弯下腰，将密码盒放到离石头地面只有几英寸的上方。\n \"是的，罗伯特，\"提彬轻声地说，用枪对准了他。\"把它放下。\"\n 兰登眼望天空，注视着牧师会礼堂圆顶上的许多空洞。他将身子蹲得更低了，低头盯着提彬手中笔直对准了他的枪。\n \"雷，对不起了。\"\n 他利索地跳起来，胳膊往天空一挥，将手中的密码盒径直朝头上的圆顶上掷去。\n 雷。提彬觉得自己并没有扣动扳机，但\"美杜莎\"手枪还是发出了震耳欲聋的响声。此刻，兰登蜷缩的身子已站了起来，差不多跟地面垂直了。子弹落在兰登脚下附近的地面上。提彬企图调整瞄准的方向，气急败坏地再次开枪，然而似乎却有一种更强大的力量，将他的目光吸引到头顶的圆形篷顶上。\n 我的拱心石！\n 时间仿佛顿时凝固了，变成了一个缓慢移动的梦。此时时刻，提彬整个的身心，都转移到空中的拱心石上去了。他注视着在空中飞行的拱心石的顶部……它在空中盘旋了一会……然后迅即跌落，翻着跟头，朝石头地板上砸了下来。\n 提彬所有的希望与梦想，随着拱心石骤然跌落到地上。它可不能掉下来啊！我得去接住它！提彬本能地作出了反应。他放下枪，飞身上前。他扔下拐杖，伸出他柔软的、修过指甲的手去接，舒展了胳膊和手指头，在空中一把将拱心石抓在了手里。\n 他以一副胜利者的姿态，紧紧地把拱心石攥在手中，向前倒了下去。但他觉得似乎倒下得太快了。由于没有什么东西能够阻止他倒下，他张开的胳膊首先碰到了地面，密码盒猛地撞到地板上，里面的玻璃瓶立刻发出令人难受的\"嘎吱嘎吱\"支离破碎的声音。\n 提彬足足有一秒钟屏住了呼吸。他张开手脚。躺在冰冷的的地板上，眼睛顺着伸展的胳膊望过去，呆呆地盯着掌心里的大理石圆筒，默默的祈祷里面的玻璃瓶子仍然完好无损。紧接着，一股刺鼻的醋的气味弥漫在空气里。提彬感到那冰凉的液体，正经过刻度盘流到他的手心里。\n 极度的恐惧攫住了他。不要！醋汩汩地流出来，提彬的脑海中闪过了瓶子里莎草纸在溶释的镜头。罗伯特，你这个傻瓜！完了，看来秘密是找不到了！\n 提彬情不自禁地抽泣起来。如果找不到圣杯，一切全完了。他真不敢相信，兰登竟会做出这样的事来。他全身颤抖着，拼命想把圆筒掰开。他强烈地希望，能赶在莎草纸永远溶释在醋里之前，飞快地将藏在它身上的历史看上一眼。然而，令他震惊的是，当他使劲拉住拱心石的两头时，圆石筒突然分开了。他喘着粗气，注视着里面。不过，里面除了玻璃的残渣碎片外，什么也没有。他并没看到有什么正在溶解的莎草纸。提彬翻了个身，抬头看着兰登。索菲站在兰登的身边，正拿枪朝下对准了他。\n 提彬一脸茫然，他回过头，看到了拱心石。奇怪的是，刻度盘已不再如方才那样杂乱了。它们组成了一个由五个字母组成的单词：APPLE.\n \"当年夏娃吃下苹果，\"兰登冷静地说：\"触犯了上帝的圣怒，因此犯下了原罪。于是苹果就成了神圣女性堕落的象征。\"提彬觉得真相突然以一种质朴得让人难受的方式朝他劈头盖脸地袭来。那个本来应该放在牛顿坟墓上的圆球竟然是从天而降，砸在牛顿头上并给他终生事业带来灵感的红艳艳的苹果。是他辛勤劳作的果实！是怀有身孕的玫瑰般肌肤。\n \"罗伯特，\"提彬结结巴巴地说，他已被震惊的情绪所淹没了。\"原来你把拱心石打开过了。地图在……在哪里？\"\n 兰登眼皮不眨一下，将手伸进斜纹软呢大衣靠近胸部的口袋里，小心翼翼地拿出一张卷起来的似乎一碰即碎的莎草纸。兰登就在提彬躺着的几码之外，将莎草纸往地上摊开，认真地看起来。过了很长时间，才看到他脸上出一丝会心的微笑。\n 他知道了！提彬渴望自己也能知道。他终生的梦想此刻就在眼前。\"告诉我！\"提彬请求道：\"我求你了，上帝啊，求你告诉我。现在还不算太晚吧？\"\n 这时，沉重的脚步声如雷鸣一般，从通往牧师会礼堂的大厅里传来，兰登平静地将莎草纸收好，塞回到口袋里。\n \"不要！\"提彬大声喊道，他拼命想站起来，然而却是徒劳。\n 屋里的门\"砰\"的推开了，贝祖。法希像只闯进竞技场的公牛一样闯了进来，他凶狠的目光飞快扫视了一周，这才发现所要寻找的目标--正无助地躺在地上的雷。提彬爵士。他轻松地吐了一口气，将\"马努汉\"牌手枪放进皮套里，转而向索菲说：\"奈芙侦探，看到你和兰登安然无恙我就放心了。刚才我叫你们进来的时候，你们就应该进来。\"英国警察紧跟在法希后面进来，他们一把捉住这只沮丧的瓮中之鳖，给他戴上了手铐。\n 索菲看到法希，似乎惊讶万分：\"你们是怎么找到我们的？\"\n 法希指了指提彬，说：\"他进教堂时犯了个错误，因此泄露了了他的身份。教堂里的保卫人员听到警方寻找他的广播，便告诉了我们。\"提彬像疯子一样大喊起来：\"寻找圣杯的地图，就在兰登的口袋里！\"\n 警察们将提彬举起来，架了出去。他掉转头，像狼一样吼道：\"罗伯特，你快告诉我圣杯藏在哪里！\"兰登在他经过身边时，直盯着他的眼睛：\"雷爵士，只有配得上的人才能找到圣杯。这还是你教我的呢。\"\n \n
