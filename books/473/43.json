{"id":30183,"no":43,"title":"Chapter 42","content":"The Depository Bank of Zurich was a twenty-four-hour Geldschrank bank offering the full modernarray of anonymous services in the tradition of the Swiss numbered account. Maintaining offices inZurich, Kuala Lumpur, New York, and Paris, the bank had expanded its services in recent years tooffer anonymous computer source code escrow services and faceless digitized backup. 　　The bread and butter of its operation was by far its oldest and simplest offering—the anonymeLager—blind drop services, otherwise known as anonymous safe-deposit boxes. Clients wishing tostore anything from stock certificates to valuable paintings could deposit their belongingsanonymously, through a series of high-tech veils of privacy, withdrawing items at any time, also intotal anonymity. 　　As Sophie pulled the taxi to a stop in front of their destination, Langdon gazed out at the building\u0027suncompromising architecture and sensed the Depository Bank of Zurich was a firm with little senseof humor. The building was a windowless rectangle that seemed to be forged entirely of dull steel. 　　Resembling an enormous metal brick, the edifice sat back from the road with a fifteen-foot-tall,neon, equilateral cross glowing over its facade. 　　Switzerland\u0027s reputation for secrecy in banking had become one of the country\u0027s most lucrativeexports. Facilities like this had become controversial in the art community because they provided aperfect place for art thieves to hide stolen goods, for years if necessary, until the heat was off. 　　Because deposits were protected from police inspection by privacy laws and were attached tonumbered accounts rather than people\u0027s names, thieves could rest easily knowing their stolen goodswere safe and could never be traced to them. 　　Sophie stopped the taxi at an imposing gate that blocked the bank\u0027s driveway—a cement-linedramp that descended beneath the building. A video camera overhead was aimed directly at them,and Langdon had the feeling that this camera, unlike those at the Louvre, was authentic. 　　Sophie rolled down the window and surveyed the electronic podium on the driver\u0027s side. An LCDscreen provided directions in seven languages. Topping the list was English. 　　INSERT KEY. 　　Sophie took the gold laser-pocked key from her pocket and turned her attention back to thepodium. Below the screen was a triangular hole. 　　\"Something tells me it will fit,\" Langdon said. 　　Sophie aligned the key\u0027s triangular shaft with the hole and inserted it, sliding it in until the entireshaft had disappeared. This key apparently required no turning. Instantly, the gate began to swingopen. Sophie took her foot off the brake and coasted down to a second gate and podium. Behindher, the first gate closed, trapping them like a ship in a lock. 　　Langdon disliked the constricted sensation. Let\u0027s hope this second gate works too. 　　This second podium bore familiar directions. 　　INSERT KEY. 　　When Sophie inserted the key, the second gate immediately opened. Moments later they werewinding down the ramp into the belly of the structure. 　　The private garage was small and dim, with spaces for about a dozen cars. At the far end, Langdonspied the building\u0027s main entrance. A red carpet stretched across the cement floor, welcomingvisitors to a huge door that appeared to be forged of solid metal. 　　Talk about mixed messages, Langdon thought. Welcome and keep out. 　　Sophie pulled the taxi into a parking space near the entrance and killed the engine. \"You\u0027d betterleave the gun here.\"With pleasure, Langdon thought, sliding the pistol under the seat. 　　Sophie and Langdon got out and walked up the red carpet toward the slab of steel. The door had nohandle, but on the wall beside it was another triangular keyhole. No directions were posted thistime. 　　\"Keeps out the slow learners,\" Langdon said. 　　Sophie laughed, looking nervous. \"Here we go.\" She stuck the key in the hole, and the door swunginward with a low hum. Exchanging glances, Sophie and Langdon entered. The door shut with athud behind them. 　　The foyer of the Depository Bank of Zurich employed as imposing a decor as any Langdon hadever seen. Where most banks were content with the usual polished marble and granite, this one hadopted for wall-to-wall metal and rivets. 　　Who\u0027s their decorator? Langdon wondered. Allied Steel? 　　Sophie looked equally intimidated as her eyes scanned the lobby. 　　The gray metal was everywhere—the floor, walls, counters, doors, even the lobby chairs appearedto be fashioned of molded iron. Nonetheless, the effect was impressive. The message was clear: 　　You are walking into a vault. 　　A large man behind the counter glanced up as they entered. He turned off the small television hewas watching and greeted them with a pleasant smile. Despite his enormous muscles and visiblesidearm, his diction chimed with the polished courtesy of a Swiss bellhop. 　　\"Bonsoir,\" he said. \"How may I help you?\"The dual-language greeting was the newest hospitality trick of the European host. It presumednothing and opened the door for the guest to reply in whichever language was more comfortable. 　　Sophie replied with neither. She simply laid the gold key on the counter in front of the man. 　　The man glanced down and immediately stood straighter. \"Of course. Your elevator is at the end ofthe hall. I will alert someone that you are on your way.\"Sophie nodded and took her key back. \"Which floor?\"The man gave her an odd look. \"Your key instructs the elevator which floor.\"She smiled. \"Ah, yes.\"The guard watched as the two newcomers made their way to the elevators, inserted their key,boarded the lift, and disappeared. As soon as the door had closed, he grabbed the phone. He wasnot calling to alert anyone of their arrival; there was no need for that. A vault greeter already hadbeen alerted automatically when the client\u0027s key was inserted outside in the entry gate. 　　Instead, the guard was calling the bank\u0027s night manager. As the line rang, the guard switched thetelevision back on and stared at it. The news story he had been watching was just ending. It didn\u0027tmatter. He got another look at the two faces on the television. 　　The manager answered. \"Oui?\"\"We have a situation down here.\"\"What\u0027s happening?\" the manager demanded. 　　\"The French police are tracking two fugitives tonight.\"\"So?\"\"Both of them just walked into our bank.\"The manager cursed quietly. \"Okay. I\u0027ll contact Monsieur Vernet immediately.\"The guard then hung up and placed a second call. This one to Interpol. 　　Langdon was surprised to feel the elevator dropping rather than climbing. He had no idea howmany floors they had descended beneath the Depository Bank of Zurich before the door finallyopened. He didn\u0027t care. He was happy to be out of the elevator. 　　Displaying impressive alacrity, a host was already standing there to greet them. He was elderly andpleasant, wearing a neatly pressed flannel suit that made him look oddly out of place—an old-world banker in a high-tech world. 　　\"Bonsoir,\" the man said. \"Good evening. Would you be so kind as to follow me, s\u0027il vous plait?\"Without waiting for a response, he spun on his heel and strode briskly down a narrow metalcorridor. 　　Langdon walked with Sophie down a series of corridors, past several large rooms filled withblinking mainframe computers. 　　\"Voici,\" their host said, arriving at a steel door and opening it for them. \"Here you are.\"Langdon and Sophie stepped into another world. The small room before them looked like a lavishsitting room at a fine hotel. Gone were the metal and rivets, replaced with oriental carpets, dark oakfurniture, and cushioned chairs. On the broad desk in the middle of the room, two crystal glassessat beside an opened bottle of Perrier, its bubbles still fizzing. A pewter pot of coffee steamedbeside it. 　　Clockwork, Langdon thought. Leave it to the Swiss. 　　The man gave a perceptive smile. \"I sense this is your first visit to us?\"Sophie hesitated and then nodded. 　　\"Understood. Keys are often passed on as inheritance, and our first-time users are invariablyuncertain of the protocol.\" He motioned to the table of drinks. \"This room is yours as long as youcare to use it.\"\"You say keys are sometimes inherited?\" Sophie asked. 　　\"Indeed. Your key is like a Swiss numbered account, which are often willed through generations. 　　On our gold accounts, the shortest safety-deposit box lease is fifty years. Paid in advance. So wesee plenty of family turnover.\"Langdon stared. \"Did you say fifty years?\"\"At a minimum,\" their host replied. \"Of course, you can purchase much longer leases, but barringfurther arrangements, if there is no activity on an account for fifty years, the contents of that safe-deposit box are automatically destroyed. Shall I run through the process of accessing your box?\"Sophie nodded. \"Please.\"Their host swept an arm across the luxurious salon. \"This is your private viewing room. Once Ileave the room, you may spend all the time you need in here to review and modify the contents ofyour safe-deposit box, which arrives... over here.\" He walked them to the far wall where a wideconveyor belt entered the room in a graceful curve, vaguely resembling a baggage claim carousel. 　　\"You insert your key in that slot there....\" The man pointed to a large electronic podium facing theconveyor belt. The podium had a familiar triangular hole. \"Once the computer confirms themarkings on your key, you enter your account number, and your safe-deposit box will be retrievedrobotically from the vault below for your inspection. When you are finished with your box, youplace it back on the conveyor belt, insert your key again, and the process is reversed. Becauseeverything is automated, your privacy is guaranteed, even from the staff of this bank. If you needanything at all, simply press the call button on the table in the center of the room.\"Sophie was about to ask a question when a telephone rang. The man looked puzzled andembarrassed. \"Excuse me, please.\" He walked over to the phone, which was sitting on the tablebeside the coffee and Perrier. 　　\"Oui?\" he answered. 　　His brow furrowed as he listened to the caller. \"Oui... oui... d\u0027accord.\" He hung up, and gave theman uneasy smile. \"I\u0027m sorry, I must leave you now. Make yourselves at home.\" He moved quicklytoward the door. 　　\"Excuse me,\" Sophie called. \"Could you clarify something before you go? You mentioned that weenter an account number?\"The man paused at the door, looking pale. \"But of course. Like most Swiss banks, our safe-depositboxes are attached to a number, not a name. You have a key and a personal account number knownonly to you. Your key is only half of your identification. Your personal account number is the otherhalf. Otherwise, if you lost your key, anyone could use it.\"Sophie hesitated. \"And if my benefactor gave me no account number?\"The banker\u0027s heart pounded. Then you obviously have no business here! He gave them a calmsmile. \"I will ask someone to help you. He will be in shortly.\"Leaving, the banker closed the door behind him and twisted a heavy lock, sealing them inside. 　　Across town, Collet was standing in the Gare du Nord train terminal when his phone rang. 　　It was Fache. \"Interpol got a tip,\" he said. \"Forget the train. Langdon and Neveu just walked intothe Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich. I want your men over there right away.\"\"Any leads yet on what Saunière was trying to tell Agent Neveu and Robert Langdon?\"Fache\u0027s tone was cold. \"If you arrest them, Lieutenant Collet, then I can ask them personally.\"Collet took the hint. \"Twenty-four Rue Haxo. Right away, Captain.\" He hung up and radioed hismen. 苏黎世储蓄银行24 小时营业，它以瑞士传统的账号开户方式经营全套的现代化不记名业务。苏黎世、科伦坡、纽约以及巴黎都设有其分支机构，它们运用计算机标识码来办理不记名业务，拥有先进的数字支持系统。 这个银行的业务操作方式其实是最古老也是最简单的--为客户提供匿名储藏箱。客户能够以匿名的方式存储任何物品--从证券到价值连城的名画--也可以在任何时候以匿名的方式提取这些物品，这一操作完全通过一整套保护隐私的高科技手段完成。 索菲将出租车停在银行门前，兰登从车窗里探出头来，望了望这座高大结实的建筑，觉得这真是个严肃的地方，让人活泼不得。大厦是长方形的，没有一扇窗，是个钢铁铸的庞然大物。这个\"大铁块\"耸立在马路边。前方还闪烁着十五英尺高的等边十字形霓虹灯。 瑞士的银行以其良好的保密措施闻名世界，吸引了全球各地的客户。这也在艺术界引起了极大的争议，因为它们也为艺术品偷盗者提供了隐藏赃物的最佳场所。他们可以把赃物放上几年，避避风头。由于储存的物品受隐私法保护不受警方的检查，又加上储存时只需开设数字账户，不需登记储户姓名，因此，那些偷盗者可以高枕无忧，既不用担心赃物的安全，也不必害怕被警方顺藤摸瓜地追查。 一扇大门挡住了银行的车道，门后那条水泥斜坡车道直通大楼的地下室。在大门上方，有一个摄像镜头。兰登估摸这个摄像镜头可不像卢浮宫里面的那些假货，是个真家伙。 索菲摇下车窗，看了看右手边的电子指示装置。液晶屏上有一条用七种不同语言显示的指令。最上面一行是英语：插入钥匙。 索菲从口袋里掏出那把用激光塑孔的金钥匙，又再次审视显示屏，只见屏幕下方有个三角形的钥匙孔。 \"我感觉，它肯定能打开。\"兰登说。 索菲将三棱柱形的钥匙身对准钥匙孔插了进去，然后慢慢往里推，把整个钥匙身都塞人了孔中。无需转动钥匙，门就自动打开了。索菲一松刹车，将车滑到第二个门和电子指示装置前。第一个门缓缓地合上了，就像一道闭合的船闸。 兰登不喜欢这种压抑的感觉，希望第二道门也能打开！第二条指令是同样的：插入钥匙。 索菲插入钥匙，第二道门也立即打开了。于是，他们就顺着斜坡转到了大楼下面。 私人停车库规模不大，灯光昏暗，停着十几辆车。车库的那头是大楼的中心人口。水泥地上的红地毯一直延伸到一扇厚厚的金属大门前。 兰登觉得这真是自相矛盾，欢迎来客又不轻易让人进入。 索菲把车开进人口旁的一个车位，熄灭了发动机。\"你最好把枪放在这儿。\" \"再好不过了。\"兰登想着，把枪扔到车座下面。 索菲和兰登下了车，踏上红地毯朝着大铁门走去。铁门没有把手，门边的墙上也有一个三角形的钥匙孔。这次没有任何指令。 \"没有悟性的人还进不去。\"兰登说。 索菲笑了起来，显得有些紧张。\"来吧。\"她把钥匙插进那个孔里。门\"嗡嗡\"地向里转开。他俩交换了个眼神，走了进去。门在他们身后\"砰\"地一声关上了。 这家储蓄银行的装饰气势逼人。大部分的银行通常只选用光亮的大理石和花岗岩作为装饰材料，而这家银行的墙壁上却尽是金属块和铆钉。 这是谁装修的？兰登颇感惊奇。是联合钢铁公司吗？ 地上、墙上、柜台上、门上，到处都是灰色的金属，就连走廊里的椅子也是铁制的。 这向人们表明：你走进了金库！ 柜台后面的一个高大强壮的男人抬起头来看了他们一眼。他关掉小电视机，微笑着向他们打招呼。虽然他肌肉发达，随身携带的武器隐约可配，但这并没有影响他那彬彬有礼的形象。 \"先生。\"他用一半英文一半法文的句子问道：\"需要我为您做点什么吗？\" 双语的问候是欧洲银行招呼客人的最新方式，让客人用感觉舒适的语言作答。 索菲什么也没有说，只是把那把金钥匙搁在柜台上。 那个男人低头看了一眼，马上站得更加笔直了。\"明白了，您的电梯在大厅那头。您先去，我马上叫人。\"索菲点了点头，拿回钥匙。\"在哪一层？\" 那人用古怪的眼神看了看索菲：\"您的钥匙不是告诉您了吗？\" 她笑道：\"啊，是啊。\" 警卫目送着两个人走向电梯，插进钥匙，走了进去。电梯门一关上，他就拿起电话。 他可不是打电话通知另外的人，因为根本就没有这个必要。因为客户的钥匙插进外面的大门时，通报装置就自动打开了。 实际上，这个电话是打给夜间值班经理的。等待接听时，警卫重新打开电视，眼睛紧紧盯着屏幕。他刚才看的新闻刚刚结束。但这没关系。他刚刚见到了屏幕上出现过的那两个人。 \"喂。\"电话里传来值班经理的声音。 \"下面有情况。\" \"发生了什么事？\"值班经理赶紧问道。 \"法国警方今晚正在追查两个逃犯。\" \"那又怎样？\" \"那两个人刚进了我们银行。\" 值班经理轻轻地骂了几句。\"好吧。我马上跟韦尔内先生联系。\" 警卫挂断电话，又拨了一次。这次是给国际刑警组织。 兰登惊奇地发现电梯不是在上升而是在下降。电梯不停地下降，也不知道过了几层，终于停了下来。他才不管这是第几层呢！能从电梯里出来，他就非常高兴了。 接待人员早就笑盈盈地站在那里等着他们。他看上去上了年纪，穿着一件熨烫整齐的法兰绒西装，这使得他看上去很古怪，跟这个地方一点也不相配--一个高科技世界里的老式银行工作人员。 \"先生。\"他说道。\"晚上好。请跟我来，好吗？\"没等回答，他转过身，大步走向一个狭窄的金属通道。 兰登和索菲向下穿过几个通道，走过几个摆放着大型计算机的房间。 \"就是这里。\"接待员说着，为他们打开一扇铁门。\"到了。\" 兰登和索菲踏人了另一个世界。这个小房间看上去就像是高级宾馆的豪华起居室。这里没有钢铁和铆钉，有的是东方的地毯、黑色的橡木家具和配置了坐垫的椅子。房间中央的宽大桌子上，两个水晶玻璃杯边放着一瓶矿泉水，矿泉水还冒着气泡，桌上还有一壶冒着热气的咖啡。 兰登不禁感叹道：\"瑞士人真是按部就班的典型。\" 那人会心地一笑：\"你们是第一次来吧？\" 索菲犹豫了一下，点了点头。 \"可以理解。钥匙经常被作为遗产传给下一代。第一次到我们这里来的客户大多不明白协议。\"他指了指放着饮料的桌子说。\"只要你们想用，这个房间就一直是你们的。\" \"钥匙有时是世代相传的？\"索菲问道。 \"没错。客户的钥匙就像瑞士银行的数字账号，经常会被作为遗产一代一代地传下去。 在我们的账户上，最短的保险箱租期是五十年，要求提前付款，所以我们会看到许多家族的后代。\"兰登睁大双眼。\"你刚才是说五十年吗？\" \"至少。\"接待员答道。\"当然，你也可以租用更长的时间。但除非有进一步的安排，否则，如果一个账户五十年未用，我们就会自动地把保险箱里的东西销毁。需要我启动程序来拿出您的箱子吗？\" 索菲点了点头。\"好的。\" 接待员指着这个豪华的房间，说道：\"这是供你们查看保险箱的密室。我一离开这里，你们就可以在这里查看或更换保险箱里的东西，想呆多长时间都行。而箱子就在这儿。\"他把他们带到对面的墙边，那里有一个宽大的传送带，看上去有点像行李提取处。\"请把钥匙插进这个小孔。\"那人指着传送带对面一个很大的电子指示装置说。装置上有个熟悉的三角形的钥匙孔。\"计算机确认是这把钥匙后，请输入你的账号。然后，你的保险箱就会由机器自动地从下面的金库里传送过来，你就可以查看了。查看完箱子后，请把它放在传送带上，再把钥匙插到这个孔里，程序就会自动重复一遍。由于整个过程是自动的，因此你们的隐私完全可以得到保证，即使是本银行的工作人员也完全不知情。如果你们有什么需要，就请按一下桌子中央的那个呼叫键。\"索菲正想提问，突然电话铃声响了起来。接待员显得有点迷惑。尴尬地说道：\"请原谅。\"他走向咖啡壶和矿泉水瓶边上的电话。 \"喂？\"他拿起电话。 听着话筒那头传来的声音，他皱起了眉头。\"是……是……\"挂上电话，他局促不安地对兰登和索菲笑了笑，说道：\"对不起，我现在得出去一下。请随意。\"然后，快步走了出去。 \"对不起。\"索菲喊道。\"走之前能不能给我们解释一下？您刚才是不是提到我们要输入账号数字？\" 那人在门口停了下来，脸色煞白。\"当然。跟其他瑞士银行一样。我们的储蓄保险箱业务开设数字账号，而不是姓名账号。你应该有一把钥匙和只有自己知道的账号。否则，假如你丢了钥匙，谁捡去了都可以用。\"索菲犹豫地问道：\"要是我的赠送人没告诉我账号怎么办？\" 接待员的心\"咚咚\"直跳。那显然你与保险箱无关！他故作镇静地对他们笑了一下，说道：\"那我去找个人来帮你。他马上就来。\" 接待员出门转身将门关上，然后转动着一个粗大的钥匙，把他们严严实实地锁在了房间里。 在城市的那一头，科莱正在火车北站。突然，他的电话响了起来。 是法希打来的。\"国际刑警找到了线索。\"他在电话里说道。\"别管火车了。兰登和奈芙刚到苏黎世储蓄银行的巴黎支行。我要你的人马上去那里。\"\"是不是索尼埃想告诉奈芙和罗伯特。兰登些什么呢？\" 法希冷冷地答道。\"科莱，如果你抓住他们，我就能亲自审问他们了！\" 科莱明白了他的意思：\"豪克斯街24 号。马上就到，局长。\" 他挂上电话，用对讲机把手下人召集起来。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8595.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
