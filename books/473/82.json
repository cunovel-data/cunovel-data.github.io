{"id":30222,"no":82,"title":"Chapter 81","content":"The Hawker is on final approach. 　　Simon Edwards—Executive Services Officer at Biggin Hill Airport—paced the control tower,squinting nervously at the rain-drenched runway. He never appreciated being awoken early on aSaturday morning, but it was particularly distasteful that he had been called in to oversee the arrestof one of his most lucrative clients. Sir Leigh Teabing paid Biggin Hill not only for a privatehangar but a \"per landing fee\" for his frequent arrivals and departures. Usually, the airfield hadadvance warning of his schedule and was able to follow a strict protocol for his arrival. Teabingliked things just so. The custom-built Jaguar stretch limousine that he kept in his hangar was to befully gassed, polished, and the day\u0027s London Times laid out on the back seat. A customs officialwas to be waiting for the plane at the hangar to expedite the mandatory documentation and luggagecheck. Occasionally, customs agents accepted large tips from Teabing in exchange for turning ablind eye to the transport of harmless organics—mostly luxury foods—French escargots, aparticularly ripe unprocessed Roquefort, certain fruits. Many customs laws were absurd, anyway,and if Biggin Hill didn\u0027t accommodate its clients, certainly competing airfields would. Teabing wasprovided with what he wanted here at Biggin Hill, and the employees reaped the benefits. 　　Edwards\u0027s nerves felt frayed now as he watched the jet coming in. He wondered if Teabing\u0027spenchant for spreading the wealth had gotten him in trouble somehow; the French authoritiesseemed very intent on containing him. Edwards had not yet been told what the charges were, butthey were obviously serious. At the French authorities\u0027 request, Kent police had ordered the BigginHill air traffic controller to radio the Hawker\u0027s pilot and order him directly to the terminal ratherthan to the client\u0027s hangar. The pilot had agreed, apparently believing the far-fetched story of a gasleak. 　　Though the British police did not generally carry weapons, the gravity of the situation had broughtout an armed response team. Now, eight policemen with handguns stood just inside the terminalbuilding, awaiting the moment when the plane\u0027s engines powered down. The instant this happened,a runway attendant would place safety wedges under the tires so the plane could no longer move. 　　Then the police would step into view and hold the occupants at bay until the French police arrivedto handle the situation. 　　The Hawker was low in the sky now, skimming the treetops to their right. Simon Edwards wentdownstairs to watch the landing from tarmac level. The Kent police were poised, just out of sight,and the maintenance man waited with his wedges. Out on the runway, the Hawker\u0027s nose tipped up,and the tires touched down in a puff of smoke. The plane settled in for deceleration, streaking fromright to left in front of the terminal, its white hull glistening in the wet weather. But rather thanbraking and turning into the terminal, the jet coasted calmly past the access lane and continued ontoward Teabing\u0027s hangar in the distance. 　　All the police spun and stared at Edwards. \"I thought you said the pilot agreed to come to theterminal!\"Edwards was bewildered. \"He did!\"Seconds later, Edwards found himself wedged in a police car racing across the tarmac toward thedistant hangar. The convoy of police was still a good five hundred yards away as Teabing\u0027s Hawkertaxied calmly into the private hangar and disappeared. When the cars finally arrived and skidded toa stop outside the gaping hangar door, the police poured out, guns drawn. 　　Edwards jumped out too. 　　The noise was deafening. 　　The Hawker\u0027s engines were still roaring as the jet finished its usual rotation inside the hangar,positioning itself nose-out in preparation for later departure. As the plane completed its 180-degreeturn and rolled toward the front of the hangar, Edwards could see the pilot\u0027s face, whichunderstandably looked surprised and fearful to see the barricade of police cars. 　　The pilot brought the plane to a final stop, and powered down the engines. The police streamed in,taking up positions around the jet. Edwards joined the Kent chief inspector, who moved warilytoward the hatch. After several seconds, the fuselage door popped open. 　　Leigh Teabing appeared in the doorway as the plane\u0027s electronic stairs smoothly dropped down. Ashe gazed out at the sea of weapons aimed at him, he propped himself on his crutches and scratchedhis head. \"Simon, did I win the policemen\u0027s lottery while I was away?\" He sounded morebewildered than concerned. 　　Simon Edwards stepped forward, swallowing the frog in his throat. \"Good morning, sir. I apologizefor the confusion. We\u0027ve had a gas leak and your pilot said he was coming to the terminal.\"\"Yes, yes, well, I told him to come here instead. I\u0027m late for an appointment. I pay for this hangar,and this rubbish about avoiding a gas leak sounded overcautious.\"\"I\u0027m afraid your arrival has taken us a bit off guard, sir.\"\"I know. I\u0027m off my schedule, I am. Between you and me, the new medication gives me the tinkles. 　　Thought I\u0027d come over for a tune-up.\"The policemen all exchanged looks. Edwards winced. \"Very good, sir.\"\"Sir,\" the Kent chief inspector said, stepping forward. \"I need to ask you to stay onboard foranother half hour or so.\"Teabing looked unamused as he hobbled down the stairs. \"I\u0027m afraid that is impossible. I have amedical appointment.\" He reached the tarmac. \"I cannot afford to miss it.\"The chief inspector repositioned himself to block Teabing\u0027s progress away from the plane. \"I amhere at the orders of the French Judicial Police. They claim you are transporting fugitives from thelaw on this plane.\"Teabing stared at the chief inspector a long moment, and then burst out laughing. \"Is this one ofthose hidden camera programs? Jolly good!\"The chief inspector never flinched. \"This is serious, sir. The French police claim you also may havea hostage onboard.\"Teabing\u0027s manservant Rémy appeared in the doorway at the top of the stairs. \"I feel like a hostageworking for Sir Leigh, but he assures me I am free to go.\" Rémy checked his watch. \"Master, wereally are running late.\" He nodded toward the Jaguar stretch limousine in the far corner of thehangar. The enormous automobile was ebony with smoked glass and whitewall tires. \"I\u0027ll bring thecar.\" Rémy started down the stairs. 　　\"I\u0027m afraid we cannot let you leave,\" the chief inspector said. \"Please return to your aircraft. Bothof you. Representatives from the French police will be landing shortly.\"Teabing looked now toward Simon Edwards. \"Simon, for heaven\u0027s sake, this is ridiculous! Wedon\u0027t have anyone else on board. Just the usual—Rémy, our pilot, and myself. Perhaps you couldact as an intermediary? Go have a look onboard, and verify that the plane is empty.\"Edwards knew he was trapped. \"Yes, sir. I can have a look.\"\"The devil you will!\" the Kent chief inspector declared, apparently knowing enough aboutexecutive airfields to suspect Simon Edwards might well lie about the plane\u0027s occupants in an effortto keep Teabing\u0027s business at Biggin Hill. \"I will look myself.\"Teabing shook his head. \"No you won\u0027t, Inspector. This is private property and until you have asearch warrant, you will stay off my plane. I am offering you a reasonable option here. Mr. 　　Edwards can perform the inspection.\"\"No deal.\"Teabing\u0027s demeanor turned frosty. \"Inspector, I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t have time to indulge in your games. 　　I\u0027m late, and I\u0027m leaving. If it is that important to you to stop me, you\u0027ll just have to shoot me.\"With that, Teabing and Rémy walked around the chief inspector and headed across the hangartoward the parked limousine. 　　The Kent chief inspector felt only distaste for Leigh Teabing as the man hobbled around him indefiance. Men of privilege always felt like they were above the law. 　　They are not. The chief inspector turned and aimed at Teabing\u0027s back. \"Stop! I will fire!\"\"Go ahead,\" Teabing said without breaking stride or glancing back. \"My lawyers will fricasseeyour testicles for breakfast. And if you dare board my plane without a warrant, your spleen willfollow.\"No stranger to power plays, the chief inspector was unimpressed. Technically, Teabing was correctand the police needed a warrant to board his jet, but because the flight had originated in France,and because the powerful Bezu Fache had given his authority, the Kent chief inspector felt certainhis career would be far better served by finding out what it was on this plane that Teabing seemedso intent on hiding. 　　\"Stop them,\" the inspector ordered. \"I\u0027m searching the plane.\"His men raced over, guns leveled, and physically blocked Teabing and his servant from reachingthe limousine. 　　Now Teabing turned. \"Inspector, this is your last warning. Do not even think of boarding thatplane. You will regret it.\"Ignoring the threat, the chief inspector gripped his sidearm and marched up the plane\u0027s gangway. 　　Arriving at the hatch, he peered inside. After a moment, he stepped into the cabin. What the devil? 　　With the exception of the frightened-looking pilot in the cockpit, the aircraft was empty. Entirelydevoid of human life. Quickly checking the bathroom, the chairs, and the luggage areas, theinspector found no traces of anyone hiding... much less multiple individuals. 　　What the hell was Bezu Fache thinking? It seemed Leigh Teabing had been telling the truth. 　　The Kent chief inspector stood alone in the deserted cabin and swallowed hard. Shit. His faceflushed, he stepped back onto the gangway, gazing across the hangar at Leigh Teabing and hisservant, who were now under gunpoint near the limousine. \"Let them go,\" the inspector ordered. 　　\"We received a bad tip.\"Teabing\u0027s eyes were menacing even across the hangar. \"You can expect a call from my lawyers. 　　And for future reference, the French police cannot be trusted.\"With that, Teabing\u0027s manservant opened the door at the rear of the stretch limousine and helped hiscrippled master into the back seat. Then the servant walked the length of the car, climbed in behindthe wheel, and gunned the engine. Policemen scattered as the Jaguar peeled out of the hangar. 　　\"Well played, my good man,\" Teabing chimed from the rear seat as the limousine accelerated outof the airport. He turned his eyes now to the dimly lit front recesses of the spacious interior. 　　\"Everyone comfy?\"Langdon gave a weak nod. He and Sophie were still crouched on the floor beside the bound andgagged albino. 　　Moments earlier, as the Hawker taxied into the deserted hangar, Rémy had popped the hatch as theplane jolted to a stop halfway through its turn. With the police closing in fast, Langdon and Sophiedragged the monk down the gangway to ground level and out of sight behind the limousine. Thenthe jet engines had roared again, rotating the plane and completing its turn as the police cars cameskidding into the hangar. 　　Now, as the limousine raced toward Kent, Langdon and Sophie clambered toward the rear of thelimo\u0027s long interior, leaving the monk bound on the floor. They settled onto the long seat facingTeabing. The Brit gave them both a roguish smile and opened the cabinet on the limo\u0027s bar. \"CouldI offer you a drink? Some nibblies? Crisps? Nuts? Seltzer?\"Sophie and Langdon both shook their heads. 　　Teabing grinned and closed the bar. \"So then, about this knight\u0027s tomb...\" \"猎鹰者\"号飞机终于靠近机场了。 西蒙。爱德华兹，比金山机场负责接待工作的一名长官，在控制塔里走来走去，不时紧张地看着那被雨水浸湿的跑道。他从不喜欢周六早上一大早就被人叫醒，不过特别让他倒胃口的是，竟然叫他负责逮捕一位对他来说好处多多的客户。雷。提彬爵士不但为他租借的私人停机库付了比金山机场一大笔钱，而且每次在他驾机来去时，总要付给他们一笔\"着陆费\"。机场会将他的飞行日程提前通知他，这样，他来时就可以严格遵照商定的协议执行。 提彬对此很是赞赏。他停靠在停机库里的专门定做的\"美洲虎\"加长豪华车，总有人给它全部上光并擦拭一新，当天的《伦敦时报》也会有人放在他的车后座上。一位海关官员将在停机库等着他的到来，以方便对他的入境证明以及行李进行检查。这里的海关工作人员不时会从提彬那里得到大笔的小费，作为交换，他们对他从外地运来的无害有机化学物--其中多半是些奢侈食品，如法国食用蜗牛，特别是宜于食用但尚未加工的羊乳干酪，还有一些水果--睁一只眼闭一只眼。不管怎么说，某些海关法律条文本身就很荒谬，而如果比金山机场不给客户提供方便，那肯定会有其他机场来跟它抢生意。比金山机场满足了提彬的要求，也从他那里得到了回报。 爱德华兹看到那架飞机，全身的神经都紧绷起来。他不知道提彬乐善好施的品性是否已莫名其妙地使他陷入麻烦之中。法国当局似乎有意对他进行抵制。但还没人告诉他是因为什么罪名。不过，他们显然太认真了。肯特警方根据法国当局的要求，命令比金山机场的航班调度员用无线电通知\"猎鹰者\"号的驾驶员，命令他直接把飞机开到机场的航空集散站，而不是此客户的私人停机库。而这位驾驶员竟然也毫无异议，很明显他相信了八辈子也打不着的所谓泄漏事件。 尽管英国警方通常都不携带武器，然而形势的严峻迫使他们组织了一支全副武装的别动队。此刻，八名荷枪实弹的警察就站在机场候车室里，等待飞机的到来。等飞机一着陆，机场的工作人员就会跑过去，在飞机轮胎下面钉上楔子，这样飞机就不能动了。然后警察就会出动，机上的人员就会束手就擒，单等法国警方前来控制局面。 \"猎鹰者\"号此时已经离地面很近了，它的右舷飞速从树梢上掠过。西蒙。爱德华兹走下楼来，站在停机坪的水平线上注视着飞机的着陆。肯特警方已蓄势待发，只是目前隐藏起来而已。而那名维修工也已经拿着楔子在旁边等待。在跑道的外头。\"猎鹰者\"号的前端翘了起来，飞机的轮胎刚挨着地面，便冒出一股青烟。飞机逐渐减速，在航空集散站前从右往左地飞奔，它那银色的机身，在这寒冷的清晨，闪烁着冷冷的光。然而飞机并没停下驶入航空集散站，而是平静地沿着机场的跑道滑行，继续往远处提彬的私人停机库驶去。 所有的警察将爱德华兹团团围住，瞪着眼睛看着他：\"我们还以为驾驶员同意把飞机开到航空集散站来呢。\"爱德华兹一脸茫然：\"他说过的呀。\" 很快，爱德华兹被裹挟进警车里，然后警车穿过停机坪向远处的停机库疾驶而去。警察的车队还远在五百码以外，而提彬的\"猎鹰者\"号飞机已经平稳地滑进私人停机库里，消失了。所有的警车终于来到了停机库，并猛地在开着的门前停住，警察们拔出枪，从车里蜂拥而出。 爱德华兹也跳了出来。 声音震耳欲聋。 那架已经停在机库里的螺旋桨飞机虽然已经停止了旋转，但引擎还在发出震天动地的响声。\"猎鹰者\"号机身朝外准备再次起飞，飞机来了个180 度大转弯，然后摇晃着向停机库的前面驶去。爱德华兹看到了驾驶员的那张脸，他露出既惊讶又恐惧的神色。面对这么多警车的包围，有这样的反应是完全可以理解的。 驾驶员终于将飞机停了下来，并关小了引擎的声音。警察蜂拥而至，在飞机四周摆好了架势。爱德华兹跟着肯特警察局的检察官小心翼翼地向飞机的舱口走去。过了几秒钟，机舱的门\"砰\"的一声打开了。 雷。提彬出现在舱口，飞机的电动舷梯平稳地放了下来。他一边紧盯着外面数不清的对准他的枪，一边将身子倚靠在拐杖上。他搔了搔头，说：\"西蒙，我不在的时候，你是不是中了警察的六合彩票了？\"他的语气里，更多的是迷茫，而不是关切。 爱德华兹走上前，他强咽下沁入喉中的雾水。\"早上好，爵士，我为造成这样混乱的局面向你道歉。我们发生了泄漏事故，可你的驾驶员答应把飞机开到航空集散站去呢。\"\"是的是的，不过是我让他到这里来。我有个约会要迟到了。我付了停机库的钱，但你们竟胡说什么是为避免油泵泄漏的事故起见，这未免太小心了吧。\"\"爵士，恐怕这次你是趁我们没做准备就跑来的吧。\" \"这我知道，我是没作此行安排。我觉得，你我之间的关系，真得用新药方来好好处理一下哩。我还以为我是到这里来休养的呢。\"警察们彼此交换着眼色。爱德华兹眨了眨眼睛，说：\"很好，爵士。\" 肯特郡的检察官走上前，说：\"恐怕你还得在飞机上再等半小时左右。\" 提彬并不为之所动，他摇摇晃晃地走下舷梯：\"这不可能。我跟医生已经约好了。\"他来到停机坪，说：\"如果失约我可担待不起。\" 检察官再次挺身挡住了提彬的去路，不让他从飞机上下来。\"我是奉法国警署之命而来的。他们说在你的飞机上藏有至今逍遥法外的逃犯。\"提彬顶了肯特警察局的检察官很长一段时间，突然大笑起来：\"你该不是在玩什么暗箱游戏吧？太有意思啦！\"检察官毫不退让：\"先生，我可是认真的。法国警方说你飞机上可能还藏有一名人质。\" 仆人雷米出现在舷梯顶端的舱口。\"我倒是很想找个人质给雷爵士干活呢，但他向我保证说我随时可以走。\"雷米看看表。\"先生，我们真的要迟到了。\"他朝停机库很远的角落里那辆\"美洲虎\"加长高级轿车点了点头。这辆庞大的汽车全身漆黑，车窗玻璃呈灰黑色，轮胎是白色的。\"我去把车开过来。\"雷米开始向舷梯下走来。 \"我们不能让你走。\"检察官说道：\"你们两位还是请回吧。法国警方马上会来这里。\" 提彬于是望着西蒙。爱德华兹：\"西蒙，看在上帝的份上，这太荒唐了吧！飞机上根本没其他人。跟往常一样，只有雷米、驾驶员和我三个人。或许你可以做中间人。你到飞机上去瞧瞧，看是否还有其他什么人。\"爱德华兹觉得自己身不由己了。\"好的，爵士，我去看看。\" \"看你个头！\"肯特警察局的长官高声叫嚷，很明显他对比金山机场的事早有所闻，所以他怀疑西蒙。爱德华兹可能会撒谎，以便能留住提彬这样的客户，继续与比金山机场交往。\"我自己去。\" 提彬摇摇头。\"你不行的，长官。这可是私人财产。如果你没有搜查令，我看你还是乖乖地呆一边去吧。在此，我也给你一个总算说得过去的机会。我只允许爱德华兹先生到上面去查。\"\"你想得倒美！\" 提彬的表情顿时冷淡下来：\"长官，我想我没时间跟你玩什么把戏。我跟医生的预约已经迟到了，我得走了。如果你非要阻止，就朝我开枪吧。\"提彬说着，便和雷米绕过这位长官，穿过停机库，向停靠在角落里的豪华轿车走去。 肯特警察局的长官望着提彬挑衅性地从他身边蹒跚而过，不禁对此人萌生一种说不出来的厌恶。来自特权阶层的人，总觉得自己能凌驾于法律之上。 但他们是不行的。那位长官转过身，瞄准了提彬的背：\"站住！否则我要开枪了。\" \"那你就开吧。\"提彬头也不回，继续大步流星向前走。\"我的律师会一刀剁了你下面的家伙，煮熟当早饭吃。如果你没搜查证就跑到我的飞机上去，那你是活得不耐烦了。\"装腔作势，吓唬谁呀。警察局的检察官对此无动于衷。尽管从正常的法律程序上讲，提彬是对的，警方要登上他的飞机，必须有证件才行，然而由于这次飞行的始发地是在法国，而且神通广大的贝祖。法希给了他这样的权力，所以肯特警察局的这位长官自信，如果他能在飞机上找到提彬似乎刻意隐藏的东西，那他今后的日子就好过多了。 \"截住他们。\"他大声命令道：\"我到飞机上去看看。\" 他的下属即刻跑过去，拿枪瞄准了提彬和雷米，并用身体挡住了他们走向轿车的去路。 提彬回过头：\"长官，我可是最后一次警告你。要上我的飞机，你最好想都别想。不然的话，你会后悔的。\"然而长官没有理会，他紧抓住扶手，朝飞机的舷梯上爬去。他来到舱口，往里面瞧了几眼。过了一会，他才走进机舱。他到底看到什么了？ 只有那个驾驶员满脸恐惧地蜷缩在飞机的座舱里，除此以外，整架飞机都是空荡荡的，连个人影也没有。他快速的在浴室里、椅子中间以及行李区里搜查了一遍，却没有发现任何东西--更不用说有人了。 贝祖。法希上尉究竟在想些什么？雷。提彬似乎并没有撒谎呢。 这位肯特警察局的检察官孤零零地站在空旷的机舱里，拼命地咽下几口气。妈的！他红着脸回到舷梯口，目不转睛地看了对面的提彬与他的仆人几眼。此时，他俩站在豪华汽车的附近，正处在枪口的威胁之下。\"放他们走。\"长官命令道：\"我们接到错误的情报了。\" 即使隔着那么远，提彬的那双眼睛仍然让人不寒而栗：\"我的律师会打电话找你的。另外就是，你们以后再也不要随便相信法国的警察了。\" 提彬的仆人打开那辆加长豪华车的后门，扶着瘸腿的主人坐到车后的椅子上，接着走到车的前方，挨着车轮钻了进去，然后开动马达。警察们慌忙散开。\"美洲虎\"飞速地冲出了停机库。 \"伙计，戏演的真棒！\"等到轿车加快速度离开了机场，提彬在车后高兴的嚷嚷。他又掉转头，看着偌大的车里模糊不清的前方，问了一句：\"各位，感觉还舒服吧？\" 兰登无力的点了点头。他和索菲还蜷缩在地上，那个被绑起来并被堵上嘴的白化病患者，此刻就躺在他们身旁。 早些时候，当\"猎鹰者\"号驶入空荡荡的停机库时，雷米在飞机中途转弯时还没等它停下来，就已经先把舱口打开了。在警察紧跟而来的那会儿，兰登与索菲一把将修道士拖下舷梯。很快躲到车子的后面，不见了。接着飞机的引擎声又惊天动地地响起来，等警车赶到停车库，飞机已经转了180 度的弯。 此刻，这辆豪华轿车正飞快的向肯特郡奔去，兰登和索菲爬到车后，将绑着的修道士撂在地上。他们找了一张面对着提彬的长椅坐下。那名英国佬狡黠的朝他们一笑，打开车内吧台的橱柜，冲他们说道：\"两位要不要喝点饮料，比如塞尔查矿泉水，或者吃点饼干、土豆片、果仁什么的？\" 索菲和兰登一起摇头。 提彬咧嘴笑了笑，关上了橱柜：\"那好，那我们开始研究这骑士的坟墓吧……\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8634.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
