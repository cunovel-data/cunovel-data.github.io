{"id":30198,"no":58,"title":"Chapter 57","content":"Standing at the roadblock outside the Depository Bank of Zurich, Lieutenant Collet wondered whatwas taking Fache so long to come up with the search warrant. The bankers were obviously hidingsomething. They claimed Langdon and Neveu had arrived earlier and were turned away from thebank because they did not have proper account identification.\\n\\n 　　So why won\u0027t they let us inside for a look?\\n\\n 　　Finally, Collet\u0027s cellular phone rang. It was the command post at the Louvre. \"Do we have a searchwarrant yet?\" Collet demanded.\\n\\n 　　\"Forget about the bank, Lieutenant,\" the agent told him. \"We just got a tip. We have the exactlocation where Langdon and Neveu are hiding.\"Collet sat down hard on the hood of his car. \"You\u0027re kidding.\"\"I have an address in the suburbs. Somewhere near Versailles.\"\"Does Captain Fache know?\"\"Not yet. He\u0027s busy on an important call.\"\"I\u0027m on my way. Have him call as soon as he\u0027s free.\" Collet took down the address and jumped inhis car. As he peeled away from the bank, Collet realized he had forgotten to ask who had tippedDCPJ off to Langdon\u0027s location. Not that it mattered. Collet had been blessed with a chance toredeem his skepticism and earlier blunders. He was about to make the most high-profile arrest ofhis career.\\n\\n 　　Collet radioed the five cars accompanying him. \"No sirens, men. Langdon can\u0027t know we\u0027recoming.\"Forty kilometers away, a black Audi pulled off a rural road and parked in the shadows on the edgeof a field. Silas got out and peered through the rungs of the wrought-iron fence that encircled thevast compound before him. He gazed up the long moonlit slope to the chateau in the distance.\\n\\n 　　The downstairs lights were all ablaze. Odd for this hour, Silas thought, smiling. The informationthe Teacher had given him was obviously accurate. I will not leave this house without the keystone,he vowed. I will not fail the bishop and the Teacher.\\n\\n 　　Checking the thirteen-round clip in his Heckler Koch, Silas pushed it through the bars and let it fallonto the mossy ground inside the compound. Then, gripping the top of the fence, he heavedhimself up and over, dropping to the ground on the other side. Ignoring the slash of pain from hiscilice, Silas retrieved his gun and began the long trek up the grassy slope.\\n\\n 科莱中尉站在苏黎世储蓄银行外的路障旁，琢磨着究竟是什么耽搁了法希，让他拿一个搜查令也用了这么长时间。那些银行的高级职员显然隐瞒了什么。他们声称兰登和奈芙早些时候来过银行，但是由于不能提供正确的账号，被赶了出去。\\n\\n 那为什么不让我们进去搜查呢？\\n\\n 科莱的手机终于响了起来。不过，电话却是从卢浮宫案发现场的指挥部打来的。\"拿到搜查令了吗？\"科莱急忙问。\\n\\n 那个警察说道：\"中尉，别管银行了。我们刚刚得到线索，知道兰登和奈芙的藏身之处了。\"科莱一屁股坐在车盖上。\"你在开玩笑吧？\"\\n\\n \"我得到一个郊区的地址，在凡尔赛附近。\"\\n\\n \"法希局长知道这件事吗？\"\\n\\n \"还不知道。他在忙着接一个重要的电话。\"\\n\\n \"我马上去。他打完电话，就马上通知他。\"他记下那地址，跳上了车。当他开着车离开银行时，他突然想起刚才竟忘了问是谁向警署透露了兰登的藏身之地。但那并不重要。他现在遇到良机来弥补因多疑而犯下的大错了。他要开始职业生涯中最令人注目的一次逮捕行动。\\n\\n 他用无线电对讲机通知其他五辆车上的人。\"别拉警报，伙计们。兰登不可能知道我们要去。\"五十公里以外的一条乡间公路上，一辆黑色的奥迪车停在了田地旁的树影里。塞拉斯下了车，透过大院外的铁栅栏朝里张望。月光下，他顺着长长的斜坡向上望去，看到了远处的别墅。\\n\\n 别墅的底楼灯火通明。\"这个时候还亮着灯，定有蹊跷。\"塞拉斯想着，不禁偷笑了起来。\\n\\n \"导师\"告诉他的消息一点儿也没错。\"我一定要拿到楔石才能离开这里。\"他发誓道。\"我决不能辜负了主教和\"导师\"的期望。\"塞拉斯检查了一下赫克勒。克奇手枪的子弹夹，子弹夹中装着十三发子弹。他把手枪塞过栅栏，扔到院子里那长满青苔的地面上。接着，他抓住栅栏，一跃而起，翻了过去，落到栅栏内。他顾不得毛布衬衫里鞭伤引起的阵阵疼痛，捡起枪，顺着长满青草的长长斜坡向上走去。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8610.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
