{"id":30186,"no":46,"title":"Chapter 45","content":"\"The police are blocking the street,\" André Vernet said, walking into the waiting room. \"Gettingyou out will be difficult.\" As he closed the door behind him, Vernet saw the heavy-duty plasticcase on the conveyor belt and halted in his tracks. My God! They accessed Saunière\u0027s account?\n 　　Sophie and Langdon were at the table, huddling over what looked to be a large wooden jewelrybox. Sophie immediately closed the lid and looked up. \"We had the account number after all,\" shesaid.\n 　　Vernet was speechless. This changed everything. He respectfully diverted his eyes from the boxand tried to figure out his next move. I have to get them out of the bank! But with the police alreadyhaving set up a roadblock, Vernet could imagine only one way to do that. \"Mademoiselle Neveu, ifI can get you safely out of the bank, will you be taking the item with you or returning it to the vaultbefore you leave?\"Sophie glanced at Langdon and then back to Vernet. \"We need to take it.\"Vernet nodded. \"Very well. Then whatever the item is, I suggest you wrap it in your jacket as wemove through the hallways. I would prefer nobody else see it.\"As Langdon shed his jacket, Vernet hurried over to the conveyor belt, closed the now empty crate,and typed a series of simple commands. The conveyor belt began moving again, carrying theplastic container back down to the vault. Pulling the gold key from the podium, he handed it toSophie.\n 　　\"This way please. Hurry.\"When they reached the rear loading dock, Vernet could see the flash of police lights filteringthrough the underground garage. He frowned. They were probably blocking the ramp. Am I reallygoing to try to pull this off? He was sweating now.\n 　　Vernet motioned to one of the bank\u0027s small armored trucks. Transport s.r was another serviceoffered by the Depository Bank of Zurich.\n 　　\"Get in the cargo hold,\" he said, heaving open the massive rear door and motioning to theglistening steel compartment. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\"As Sophie and Langdon climbed in, Vernet hurried across the loading dock to the dock overseer\u0027soffice, let himself in, collected the keys for the truck, and found a driver\u0027s uniform jacket and cap.\n 　　Shedding his own suit coat and tie, he began to put on the driver\u0027s jacket. Reconsidering, he donneda shoulder holster beneath the uniform. On his way out, he grabbed a driver\u0027s pistol from the rack,put in a clip, and stuffed it in the holster, buttoning his uniform over it. Returning to the truck,Vernet pulled the driver\u0027s cap down low and peered in at Sophie and Langdon, who were standinginside the empty steel box.\n 　　\"You\u0027ll want this on,\" Vernet said, reaching inside and flicking a wall switch to illuminate the lonecourtesy bulb on the hold\u0027s ceiling. \"And you\u0027d better sit down. Not a sound on our way out thegate.\"Sophie and Langdon sat down on the metal floor. Langdon cradled the treasure wadded in histweed jacket. Swinging the heavy doors closed, Vernet locked them inside. Then he got in behindthe wheel and revved the engine.\n 　　As the armored truck lumbered toward the top of the ramp, Vernet could feel the sweat alreadycollecting beneath his driver\u0027s cap. He could see there were far more police lights in front than hehad imagined. As the truck powered up the ramp, the interior gate swung inward to let him pass.\n 　　Vernet advanced and waited while the gate behind him closed before pulling forward and trippingthe next sensor. The second gate opened, and the exit beckoned.\n 　　Except for the police car blocking the top of the ramp.\n 　　Vernet dabbed his brow and pulled forward.\n 　　A lanky officer stepped out and waved him to a stop a few meters from the roadblock. Four patrolcars were parked out front.\n 　　Vernet stopped. Pulling his driver\u0027s cap down farther, he effected as rough a facade as his culturedupbringing would allow. Not budging from behind the wheel, he opened the door and gazed downat the agent, whose face was stern and sallow.\n 　　\"Qu\u0027est-ce qui se passe?\" Vernet asked, his tone rough.\n 　　\"Je suis Jérome Collet,\" the agent said. \"Lieutenant Police Judiciaire.\" He motioned to the truck\u0027scargo hold. \"Qu\u0027est-ce qu\u0027ily a là dedans?\"\"Hell if I know,\" Vernet replied in crude French. \"I\u0027m only a driver.\"Collet looked unimpressed. \"We\u0027re looking for two criminals.\"Vernet laughed. \"Then you came to the right spot. Some of these bastards I drive for have so muchmoney they must be criminals.\"The agent held up a passport picture of Robert Langdon. \"Was this man in your bank tonight?\"Vernet shrugged. \"No clue. I\u0027m a dock rat. They don\u0027t let us anywhere near the clients. You need togo in and ask the front desk.\"\"Your bank is demanding a search warrant before we can enter.\"Vernet put on a disgusted look. \"Administrators. Don\u0027t get me started.\"\"Open your truck, please.\" Collet motioned toward the cargo hold.\n 　　Vernet stared at the agent and forced an obnoxious laugh. \"Open the truck? You think I have keys?\n 　　You think they trust us? You should see the crap wages I get paid.\"The agent\u0027s head tilted to one side, his skepticism evident. \"You\u0027re telling me you don\u0027t have keysto your own truck?\"Vernet shook his head. \"Not the cargo area. Ignition only. These trucks get sealed by overseers onthe loading dock. Then the truck sits in dock while someone drives the cargo keys to the drop-off.\n 　　Once we get the call that the cargo keys are with the recipient, then I get the okay to drive. Not asecond before. I never know what the hell I\u0027m lugging.\"\"When was this truck sealed?\"\"Must have been hours ago. I\u0027m driving all the way up to St. Thurial tonight. Cargo keys arealready up there.\"The agent made no response, his eyes probing as if trying to read Vernet\u0027s mind.\n 　　A drop of sweat was preparing to slide down Vernet\u0027s nose. \"You mind?\" he said, wiping his nosewith his sleeve and motioning to the police car blocking his way. \"I\u0027m on a tight schedule.\"\"Do all the drivers wear Rolexes?\" the agent asked, pointing to Vernet\u0027s wrist.\n 　　Vernet glanced down and saw the glistening band of his absurdly expensive watch peeking outfrom beneath the sleeve of his jacket. Merde. \"This piece of shit? Bought it for twenty euro from aTaiwanese street vendor in St. Germain des Prés. I\u0027ll sell it to you for forty.\"The agent paused and finally stepped aside. \"No thanks. Have a safe trip.\"Vernet did not breathe again until the truck was a good fifty meters down the street. And now hehad another problem. His cargo. Where do I take them?\n \"警察正在封锁街道。\"安德烈。韦尔内边说边走进房间。\"让你们出去很困难。\"关上门后，他发现了传送带上的那个结实的塑料箱。上帝！他们找到了索尼埃的账号？\n 索菲和兰登正挤在桌旁看着一个大大的木头珠宝盒。索菲合上盖子，抬头说道：\"我们终究还是找到了账号。\"韦尔内一句话也没说。一切都为之改变了。他敬畏地把眼光从盒子上移开，计划着下一步的行动。\"我必须得把他们送出银行！\"由于警察已经设置了路障，韦尔内只能想出一个办法把他们弄出去。\"奈芙小姐，如果我能把你们安全地送出银行，你是要把这个东西带上呢，还是在走之前把它重新放回金库？\"\n 索菲看了兰登一眼，对韦尔内说：\"我们得把它带走。\"\n 韦尔内点点头，说道：\"好的。那么，不管那是什么，我建议你们穿过通道时用夹克衫把它包起来。我不希望让别人看到。\"兰登脱下夹克衫，韦尔内快步走到传送带旁关上那个空箱子，然后输入了几个简单的指令。于是，传送带又开始转动，把那个塑料箱运回金库。他从电子装置上拔出钥匙递给索菲。\n \"这边走。快！\"\n 他们到达装货台时，韦尔内可以看到从地下车库里透过来的闪烁的警灯。他皱起了眉头。他们也许正在封锁坡道。我能把他们成功地带出去吗？他浑身冷汗直冒。\n 他走向一辆银行的小型装甲车。安全运输是苏黎世储蓄银行提供的另一项服务。\"快进货舱。\"他打开沉重的后门，指着闪闪发亮的铁车厢说。\"我马上就回来。\"索菲和兰登往车厢里爬，韦尔内则急匆匆地穿过装货台，走进装货台那头的办公室，拿起一串钥匙，找出一件司机穿的工装夹克衫和一顶帽子。他脱下自己的西装外套，解下领带，换上司机穿的夹克衫。转念一想，他又在制服里面系上了枪套。出来时，他从行李架上抓起一把司机用的手枪，装上子弹，把枪塞进枪套，然后扣上制服的纽扣。他走回装甲车，拉低帽檐，瞅了瞅站在空荡荡的铁车厢里的索菲和兰登。\n \"你们需要把这个打开。\"韦尔内边说边伸手进货舱按了一下墙上的开关，打开了舱顶上的照明灯。\"你们最好坐下。出大门时千万别出声。\"\n 索菲和兰登坐在货舱的金属地板上。兰登抱着那个用斜纹呢夹克裹着的宝贝。韦尔内\"砰\"地一声把大铁门关上，把他们锁在了里面。然后，他坐到方向盘后，启动了装甲车。\n 当装甲车轰隆隆地顺着坡道往上开时，韦尔内感到帽子里已经满是汗水。前方的警灯远比想象的要多。当装甲车加速爬上坡道时，第一道门朝里打开了。韦尔内开了过去。门在车后关上了。他继续把车开到第二道门前。第二道门也打开了。马上就可以出去了。\n 除非警车把坡道口封住了。\n 韦尔内轻轻地擦了擦眉头的汗，继续前进。\n 一个瘦高个的警察走上前来，挥手让他把车停在路障前。前面远一点的地方停着四辆巡逻车。\n 韦尔内把车停下。他把帽檐压得低低的，尽量掩饰起平时温文尔雅的风度，装出一副粗暴冷酷的样子。他推开车门，坐在方向盘后俯视着那个脸色铁青的警察。\n \"这不是我们自己的通道吗？\"韦尔内粗声问道。\n \"我是科莱，警署中尉。\"那个警察说道。他指着装甲车的货舱问：\"这里面是什么？\"\n 韦尔内用粗鲁的法语回答：\"见鬼！我怎么知道那是什么东西。我只不过是个司机。\"\n 科莱不动声色，继续说道：\"我们正在寻找两个罪犯。\"\n 韦尔内放声大笑起来：\"那你就来对地方了。雇我开车的几个混蛋这么有钱，他们肯定是罪犯。\"\n 那个警察拿出一张罗伯特。兰登护照上的照片，问道：\"这个人今天晚上是不是在你们银行？\"\n 韦尔内耸耸肩说：\"不知道。我只是装货台上的小老鼠。他们不让我们接近客户。你应该进去问一下前台。\"\"银行非要我们出示搜查令才让我们进。\"\n 韦尔内露出厌烦的表情。\"别拿当官的吓唬人。\"\n \"请打开车厢。\"科莱指着货舱说。\n 韦尔内瞪了他一眼，发出一阵怪笑。\"打开车厢？你以为我有钥匙？你以为他们这么信任我们？他XX 的，你看看我拿的那一丁点薪水就知道了。\"警察歪着头，显然不相信他的话。\"你说你没有自己车上的钥匙？\"\n 韦尔内摇摇头。\"没有货舱的钥匙。只有开车用的。工头把货舱在装车的地方锁好后，让车等在那里，然后派人另外开着车把钥匙交给收货人。我们这边接到电话说收货人已经拿到钥匙后，才能发车。提前一秒钟都不行。他妈的，我从来都不知道我拉的是什么东西。\"\"这辆车是什么时候锁上的？\"\n \"肯定是在几个小时之前。我今晚要一直把车开到圣。塞瑞，货舱的钥匙早就到那儿了。\"警察不吱声，只是死死地盯着他，好像要看出他的心思。\n 一颗汗珠眼看就要滑下韦尔内的鼻子了。\"你不介意把它开走吧？\"他用袖子擦了一下鼻子，顺势指着那辆挡在路上的警车说。\"我要赶时间。\"\n \"所有的司机都戴劳力士手表吗？\"警察指着韦尔内的手腕问道。\n 韦尔内低头一看，发现他那块闪闪发亮的昂贵的名表从夹克衫的袖子下面露了出来。\n \"他妈的，这个东西吗？在圣。塞瑞时从一个台湾小贩那里用20 欧元买的。你要的话，我40块钱卖给你。\"警察犹豫了一下，终于还是放行了。\"不用，谢谢。路上注意安全。\"\n 韦尔内把车开出足足50 米后，才长出了一口气。现在，他又要面对另外一个问题--他的货物。我把他们送到哪里去呢？\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8598.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
