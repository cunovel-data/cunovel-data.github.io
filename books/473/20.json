{"id":30160,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 19","content":"The Church of Saint-Sulpice, it is said, has the most eccentric history of any building in Paris. Builtover the ruins of an ancient temple to the Egyptian goddess Isis, the church possesses anarchitectural footprint matching that of Notre Dame to within inches. The sanctuary has playedhost to the baptisms of the Marquis de Sade and Baudelaire, as well as the marriage of VictorHugo. The attached seminary has a well-documented history of unorthodoxy and was once theclandestine meeting hall for numerous secret societies.\\n\\n 　　Tonight, the cavernous nave of Saint-Sulpice was as silent as a tomb, the only hint of life the faintsmell of incense from mass earlier that evening. Silas sensed an uneasiness in Sister Sandrine\u0027sdemeanor as she led him into the sanctuary. He was not surprised by this. Silas was accustomed topeople being uncomfortable with his appearance.\\n\\n 　　\"You\u0027re an American,\" she said.\\n\\n 　　\"French by birth,\" Silas responded. \"I had my calling in Spain, and I now study in the UnitedStates.\"Sister Sandrine nodded. She was a small woman with quiet eyes. \"And you have never seen Saint-Sulpice?\"\"I realize this is almost a sin in itself.\"\"She is more beautiful by day.\"\"I am certain. Nonetheless, I am grateful that you would provide me this opportunity tonight.\"\"The abbé requested it. You obviously have powerful friends.\"You have no idea, Silas thought.\\n\\n 　　As he followed Sister Sandrine down the main aisle, Silas was surprised by the austerity of thesanctuary. Unlike Notre Dame with its colorful frescoes, gilded altar-work, and warm wood, Saint-Sulpice was stark and cold, conveying an almost barren quality reminiscent of the asceticcathedrals of Spain. The lack of decor made the interior look even more expansive, and as Silasgazed up into the soaring ribbed vault of the ceiling, he imagined he was standing beneath the hullof an enormous overturned ship.\\n\\n 　　A fitting image, he thought. The brotherhood\u0027s ship was about to be capsized forever. Feeling eagerto get to work, Silas wished Sister Sandrine would leave him. She was a small woman whom Silascould incapacitate easily, but he had vowed not to use force unless absolutely necessary. She is awoman of the cloth, and it is not her fault the brotherhood chose her church as a hiding place fortheir keystone. She should not be punished for the sins of others.\\n\\n 　　\"I am embarrassed, Sister, that you were awoken on my behalf.\"\"Not at all. You are in Paris a short time. You should not miss Saint-Sulpice. Are your interests inthe church more architectural or historical?\"\"Actually, Sister, my interests are spiritual.\"She gave a pleasant laugh. \"That goes without saying. I simply wondered where to begin yourtour.\"Silas felt his eyes focus on the altar. \"A tour is unnecessary. You have been more than kind. I canshow myself around.\"\"It is no trouble,\" she said. \"After all, I am awake.\"Silas stopped walking. They had reached the front pew now, and the altar was only fifteen yardsaway. He turned his massive body fully toward the small woman, and he could sense her recoil asshe gazed up into his red eyes. \"If it does not seem too rude, Sister, I am not accustomed to simplywalking into a house of God and taking a tour. Would you mind if I took some time alone to praybefore I look around?\"Sister Sandrine hesitated. \"Oh, of course. I shall wait in the rear of the church for you.\"Silas put a soft but heavy hand on her shoulder and peered down. \"Sister, I feel guilty already forhaving awoken you. To ask you to stay awake is too much. Please, you should return to bed. I canenjoy your sanctuary and then let myself out.\"She looked uneasy. \"Are you sure you won\u0027t feel abandoned?\"\"Not at all. Prayer is a solitary joy.\"\"As you wish.\"Silas took his hand from her shoulder. \"Sleep well, Sister. May the peace of the Lord be with you.\"\"And also with you.\" Sister Sandrine headed for the stairs. \"Please be sure the door closes tightlyon your way out.\"\"I will be sure of it.\" Silas watched her climb out of sight. Then he turned and knelt in the frontpew, feeling the cilice cut into his leg.\\n\\n 　　Dear God, I offer up to you this work I do today....\\n\\n 　　Crouching in the shadows of the choir balcony high above the altar, Sister Sandrine peered silentlythrough the balustrade at the cloaked monk kneeling alone. The sudden dread in her soul made ithard to stay still. For a fleeting instant, she wondered if this mysterious visitor could be the enemythey had warned her about, and if tonight she would have to carry out the orders she had beenholding all these years. She decided to stay there in the darkness and watch his every move.\\n\\n 据说，在巴黎，圣叙尔皮斯教堂的历史最为奇异。它是在一座古庙的废墟上建立起来的，而那座古庙原先是为埃及女神爱塞丝而修建的。圣叙尔皮斯教堂的建筑风格与巴黎圣母院的风格极其相似。这座教堂曾主持过马尔。德。萨特和波德莱尔的洗礼仪式和雨果的婚礼。它的附属神学院见证过一段异教发展史，曾被作为许多秘密团体的地下集会场所。\\n\\n 今晚，圣叙尔皮斯那洞穴般幽深的中殿寂静得好似一座坟墓。傍晚人们焚香时残留的气味，是这里唯一的一丝生气。当桑德琳嬷嬷将塞拉斯领进教堂时，塞拉斯从她的举止中感觉到了不安。他并不感到奇怪。人们看见他的样子都会觉得不舒服，塞拉斯对此早已习以为常了。\\n\\n \"你是美国人吧。\"她说。\\n\\n \"我出生在法国。\"塞拉斯回答道。\"在西班牙入教，现在在美国学习。\"\\n\\n 桑德琳嬷嬷身材矮小，目光安详。\"你第一次来这个教堂吧？\"\\n\\n \"以前没来过，我想这就是个罪过。\"\\n\\n \"白天时，她看上去更美丽。\"\\n\\n \"我相信。无论如何，感谢您这么晚还让我进来。\"\\n\\n \"院长下了命令。你肯定有一些有权势的朋友吧。\"\\n\\n 你一无所知，塞拉斯想。\\n\\n 当塞拉斯在桑德琳嬷嬷的引导下沿着走道前行时，他为中殿的朴素感到惊讶。这里没有巴黎圣母院里那种色彩缤纷的壁画，也没有光彩夺目的圣坛，更没有用来取暖的柴火。\\n\\n 圣叙尔皮斯让人感到荒凉而寒冷，让人回想起西班牙禁欲者的大教堂。由于缺乏装饰，大殿显得更加空旷。塞拉斯仰望着拱顶，觉得自己仿佛置身于许多倒扣着的船身下。\\n\\n 这个样子正合我意，塞拉斯想。兄弟会的人就要翻船了，他们都将永沉海底。塞拉斯迫不及待地想开始执行他的任务，希望把桑德琳嬷嬷支开。虽然塞拉斯可以轻而易举地废了这个矮小瘦弱的女人，但他已经发过誓不在迫不得已时绝不使用暴力。她也不知情，兄弟会将楔石藏在她所在的教堂，这也不是她的错。她不应该为别人的罪过而受到惩罚。\\n\\n \"真不好意思，我把您吵醒了。\"\\n\\n \"没关系。你刚来到巴黎，不应该错过到这里的机会。你对教堂的建筑感兴趣，还是对教堂的历史感兴趣呢？\"\\n\\n \"嬷嬷，其实我只是为信仰而来的。\"\\n\\n 嬷嬷高兴地笑了起来。\"这还用说？不过，带你从哪里开始参观呢？\"\\n\\n 塞拉斯注视着圣坛。\"不用参观了。您不必这么客气。我可以自己逛逛。\"\\n\\n \"没关系，反正我已经醒了。\"嬷嬷说。\\n\\n 这时，他们已走到了教堂的前排座位，距圣坛不足十五码远了。塞拉斯停住了脚步，转过庞大的身躯，面对着嬷嬷。他可以感觉到嬷嬷正畏惧地看着他那发红的眼睛。\"嬷嬷，请原谅我的粗鲁。我不习惯走进教堂这样神圣的地方就四处闲逛。我想在参观前独自做一下祷告，您不介意吧？请您回去睡觉吧！我可以独自欣赏一下您的圣殿，然后自己离开。\"桑德琳嬷嬷犹豫了一下，说：\"哦，当然不介意。我在后排座位上等你。\"\\n\\n 塞拉斯将他那柔软而又厚重的大手放在嬷嬷身上，俯视着她，说道：\"嬷嬷，把您吵醒我已经很不好意思了，再不让您去睡觉更是过意不去。请您回去睡觉吧！我可以独自欣赏一下您的圣殿，然后自己离开。\"嬷嬷看上去很不安。\"你肯定自己不会有种被遗弃般的孤独吗？\"\\n\\n \"不会的。祷告是一个人享受的快乐。\"\\n\\n \"那你就自便吧。\"\\n\\n 塞拉斯将手从她的肩膀上移开。\"睡个好觉，嬷嬷。愿上帝保佑你平安。\"\\n\\n \"也保佑你平安。\"桑德琳嬷嬷朝楼梯走去。\"走的时候一定要把门关紧。\"\\n\\n \"我一定会的。\"塞拉斯看着桑德琳嬷嬷爬上了楼梯，消失在他的视线中。然后，他转过身来，跪在前排的座位上。\\n\\n 亲爱的上帝，我今晚的工作是为您而做的……\\n\\n 桑德琳嬷嬷蹲在圣坛上方的唱诗班站台的阴影中，透过栏杆，静静地注视着独自跪在下方的那个伪装的修道士。突然袭上她心头的恐惧使她难以平静。刹那间，她觉得这个神秘的来访者可能就是兄弟会提醒她要注意的敌人，可能今晚她必须执行多年来她一直肩负着的使命。她决定躲在黑暗中，观察他的一举一动。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8572.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
