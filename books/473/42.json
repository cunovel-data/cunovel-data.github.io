{"id":30182,"no":42,"title":"Chapter 41","content":"Outside Castel Gandolfo, an updraft of mountain air gushed over the top of the cliff and across thehigh bluff, sending a chill through Bishop Aringarosa as he stepped from the Fiat. I should haveworn more than this cassock, he thought, fighting the reflex to shiver. The last thing he needed toappear tonight was weak or fearful.\\n\\n 　　The castle was dark save the windows at the very top of the building, which glowed ominously.\\n\\n 　　The library, Aringarosa thought. They are awake and waiting. He ducked his head against the windand continued on without so much as a glance toward the observatory domes.\\n\\n 　　The priest who greeted him at the door looked sleepy. He was the same priest who had greetedAringarosa five months ago, albeit tonight he did so with much less hospitality. \"We were worriedabout you, Bishop,\" the priest said, checking his watch and looking more perturbed than worried.\\n\\n 　　\"My apologies. Airlines are so unreliable these days.\"The priest mumbled something inaudible and then said, \"They are waiting upstairs. I will escortyou up.\"The library was a vast square room with dark wood from floor to ceiling. On all sides, toweringbookcases burgeoned with volumes. The floor was amber marble with black basalt trim, ahandsome reminder that this building had once been a palace.\\n\\n 　　\"Welcome, Bishop,\" a man\u0027s voice said from across the room.\\n\\n 　　Aringarosa tried to see who had spoken, but the lights were ridiculously low—much lower thanthey had been on his first visit, when everything was ablaze. The night of stark awakening.\\n\\n 　　Tonight, these men sat in the shadows, as if they were somehow ashamed of what was about totranspire.\\n\\n 　　Aringarosa entered slowly, regally even. He could see the shapes of three men at a long table onthe far side of the room. The silhouette of the man in the middle was immediatelyrecognizable—the obese Secretariat Vaticana, overlord of all legal matters within Vatican City.\\n\\n 　　The other two were high-ranking Italian cardinals.\\n\\n 　　Aringarosa crossed the library toward them. \"My humble apologies for the hour. We\u0027re on differenttime zones. You must be tired.\"\"Not at all,\" the secretariat said, his hands folded on his enormous belly. \"We are grateful you havecome so far. The least we can do is be awake to meet you. Can we offer you some coffee orrefreshments?\"\"I\u0027d prefer we don\u0027t pretend this is a social visit. I have another plane to catch. Shall we get tobusiness?\"\"Of course,\" the secretariat said. \"You have acted more quickly than we imagined.\"\"Have I?\"\"You still have a month.\"\"You made your concerns known five months ago,\" Aringarosa said. \"Why should I wait?\"\"Indeed. We are very pleased with your expediency.\"Aringarosa\u0027s eyes traveled the length of the long table to a large black briefcase. \"Is that what Irequested?\"\"It is.\" The secretariat sounded uneasy. \"Although, I must admit, we are concerned with therequest. It seems quite...\"\"Dangerous,\" one of the cardinals finished. \"Are you certain we cannot wire it to you somewhere?\\n\\n 　　The sum is exorbitant.\"Freedom is expensive. \"I have no concerns for my own safety. God is with me.\"The men actually looked doubtful.\\n\\n 　　\"The funds are exactly as I requested?\"The secretariat nodded. \"Large-denomination bearer bonds drawn on the Vatican Bank. Negotiableas cash anywhere in the world.\"Aringarosa walked to the end of the table and opened the briefcase. Inside were two thick stacks ofbonds, each embossed with the Vatican seal and the title PORTATORE, making the bondsredeemable to whoever was holding them.\\n\\n 　　The secretariat looked tense. \"I must say, Bishop, all of us would feel less apprehensive if thesefunds were in cash.\"I could not lift that much cash, Aringarosa thought, closing the case. \"Bonds are negotiable as cash.\\n\\n 　　You said so yourself.\"The cardinals exchanged uneasy looks, and finally one said, \"Yes, but these bonds are traceabledirectly to the Vatican Bank.\"Aringarosa smiled inwardly. That was precisely the reason the Teacher suggested Aringarosa getthe money in Vatican Bank bonds. It served as insurance. We are all in this together now. \"This isa perfectly legal transaction,\" Aringarosa defended. \"Opus Dei is a personal prelature of VaticanCity, and His Holiness can disperse monies however he sees fit. No law has been broken here.\"\"True, and yet...\" The secretariat leaned forward and his chair creaked under the burden. \"We haveno knowledge of what you intend to do with these funds, and if it is in any way illegal...\"\"Considering what you are asking of me,\" Aringarosa countered, \"what I do with this money is notyour concern.\"There was a long silence.\\n\\n 　　They know I\u0027m right, Aringarosa thought. \"Now, I imagine you have something for me to sign?\"They all jumped, eagerly pushing the paper toward him, as if they wished he would simply leave.\\n\\n 　　Aringarosa eyed the sheet before him. It bore the papal seal. \"This is identical to the copy you sentme?\"\"Exactly.\"Aringarosa was surprised how little emotion he felt as he signed the document. The three menpresent, however, seemed to sigh in relief.\\n\\n 　　\"Thank you, Bishop,\" the secretariat said. \"Your service to the Church will never be forgotten.\"Aringarosa picked up the briefcase, sensing promise and authority in its weight. The four menlooked at one another for a moment as if there were something more to say, but apparently therewas not. Aringarosa turned and headed for the door.\\n\\n 　　\"Bishop?\" one of the cardinals called out as Aringarosa reached the threshold.\\n\\n 　　Aringarosa paused, turning. \"Yes?\"\"Where will you go from here?\"Aringarosa sensed the query was more spiritual than geographical, and yet he had no intention ofdiscussing morality at this hour. \"Paris,\" he said, and walked out the door.\\n\\n 岗道尔夫堡外，一股由下而上的山风刮过悬崖，穿过峭壁，直直地吹向刚从菲亚特轿车上下来的阿林加洛沙主教，让他感到阵阵寒意。我应该在这件法衣之外再加点衣服，他想道，竭力控制着不让自己打寒颤。他今晚决不能表现出软弱。\\n\\n 除了顶层的几扇窗户里透出几缕不祥的灯光外，整个城堡一片漆黑。那肯定是图书馆，阿林加洛沙想。他们还没睡，正等着我呢。他扫视了一下天文台的圆形屋顶，低下头，迎着风继续往前走。\\n\\n 在门口迎接他的教土睡眼惺忪。他就是五个月前迎接阿林加洛沙的那个教士，只是今晚他显得没有以前那么热情。\"我们正为您担心呢，主教大人。\"那个教士看了一下手表，说道。他那副表情与其说是担忧，倒不如说是忐忑不安。\\n\\n \"非常抱歉。最近的航班时刻表老是靠不住。\"\\n\\n 教士小声地嘟囔了些什么，接着说道：\"他们在楼上等着您呢。我陪您上去。\"\\n\\n 图书馆设在一个宽敞的方形房间里，地板和天花板上都由深色的木材装饰。墙壁的四周摆放着高大的书柜，上面摆满了书。琥珀色大理石地砖和地面边缘的黑色玄武岩，仿佛在提醒人们这里曾是皇宫。\\n\\n \"欢迎您，主教大人。\"一个男人的声音从房间那头传来。\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙试图找到讲话的人，可是灯光出奇地暗，远比上次他来访时暗得多。那时灯光耀眼。彻底觉醒之夜。今晚，这些人坐在阴影里，像为将要发生的事情感到羞愧似的。\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙慢慢地踱进房门，看上去像个帝王。他隐约地看到房间那头的长桌子边有三个男人的身影。他一眼就从轮廓辨认出了中间的那个人，那是梵蒂冈的肥胖秘书，全权负责梵蒂冈城的所有法律事务。另外两个人是意大利的高级主教。\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙向他们走去。\"我非常抱歉这时候来找你们。我们的时区不同，你们一定很累了吧。\"\"没关系。\"那位秘书说着，双手交叉着放在他肥大的肚子上。\"我们非常感激您能这么远赶来。我们只不过是起床迎接您罢了，谈不上辛苦。您要不要喝杯咖啡，或是来些点心？\"\\n\\n \"不必客套。我还要去赶另一班飞机。我们谈正事吧？\"\\n\\n \"当然可以。\"秘书说道。\"没想到您行动这么快。\"\\n\\n \"是吗？\"\\n\\n \"您还有一个月的时间呢。\"\\n\\n \"你们五个月之前就告诉了我你们关心的事情。\"阿林加洛沙说：\"我为什么要等呢？\"\\n\\n \"确实。您的快速的行动让我们非常高兴。\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙望着长桌那头的黑色大公文包，问道：\"那就是我要的？\"\\n\\n \"是的。\"\"秘书不太自然地回答道。\"虽然我不得不承认我们非常尊重您的要求，可是那也太……\"\"危险。\"一位红衣主教接下去说道。\"您要知道我们不能寄给您。数目太庞大。\"\\n\\n \"自由是昂贵的！我已将生死置之度外，上帝会保佑我。\"\\n\\n 那帮人看上去有点儿怀疑。\\n\\n \"是我要的数目吗？\"\\n\\n 秘书点了点头：\"梵蒂冈银行签发的大额持票人证券。跟现金一样，世界通用。\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙走到桌子的尽头，打开公文包。里面有两叠厚厚的证券，每张上面都有梵蒂冈的印章和教堂的字样，那确保了任何持票人都可将其兑换成现金。\\n\\n 秘书看上去有些局促不安。\"我不得不承认，主教大人，假如这笔款子是现金的话，我们都会稍稍安心一些。\"\\n\\n 我可拿不动那么多现金，阿林加洛沙想道。他合上公文包，说道：\"证券跟现金一样可以在各地流通。这可是你们说的。\"几个红衣主教交换了一下不安的眼神，最后说道：\"是的。可是通过这些证券可以追查到梵蒂冈银行。\"阿林加洛沙暗笑，这正是那位导师让阿林加洛沙要梵蒂冈银行证券的原因。这是为保险起见，我们的命运被绑在一起了。\"这说明我们的交易是完全合法的。\"阿林加洛沙辩解道。\\n\\n \"天主事工会是梵蒂冈的最高统领，它有权处置这笔钱。况且，我们所做的一切都在法律许可的范围之内。\"\"确实如此，可是……\"秘书身体前倾，椅子被他压得吱吱作响。\"我们并不知道你究竟会怎样处置这笔款子。假如有任何违法行为的话……\"\"考虑到你们对我的要求。\"阿林加洛沙反驳道：\"我怎样处理这笔款子与你们无关。\"\\n\\n 房间里顿时鸦雀无声。\\n\\n 他们知道我是对的，阿林加洛沙想。\"那么现在，有什么东西需要我签字吗？\"\\n\\n 他们一跃而起，急切地把一份文件推到他面前，好像都盼望着他快点离开。\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙扫视了一下面前那张薄薄的纸，只见上面盖着教皇的大印。\"这份文件跟你们给我的那张复印件一模一样吗？\"\\n\\n \"完全一样。\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙签上了名，他为自己能如此平静而颇感意外。那三个人看上去松了一口气。\\n\\n \"感谢您，主教。\"秘书说。\"您对教会的贡献将永远被人们铭记。\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙拿起公文包，此刻他真切地感受到了承诺和权威的分量。四个人面面相觑，好像有什么话要说，但显然又说不出什么。\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙走到门口时，一位红衣主教喊住了他。\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙停下脚步，转身问道：\"什么事？\"\\n\\n \"离开这里后，您打算去哪儿？\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙知道他问的应该是灵魂的归属，不是地理方位，而他现在不想讨论精神道德的问题。\"巴黎。\"他说着，走出了房门。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8594.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
