{"id":30240,"no":100,"title":"Chapter 99","content":"Sir Leigh Teabing felt rueful as he gazed out over the barrel of his Medusa revolver at RobertLangdon and Sophie Neveu. \"My friends,\" he said, \"since the moment you walked into my homelast night, I have done everything in my power to keep you out of harm\u0027s way. But your persistencehas now put me in a difficult position.\"He could see the expressions of shock and betrayal on Sophie\u0027s and Langdon\u0027s faces, and yet hewas confident that soon they would both understand the chain of events that had guided the three ofthem to this unlikely crossroads.\\n\\n 　　There is so much I have to tell you both... so much you do not yet understand.\\n\\n 　　\"Please believe,\" Teabing said, \"I never had any intention of your being involved. You came to myhome. You came searching for me.\"\"Leigh?\" Langdon finally managed. \"What the hell are you doing? We thought you were in trouble.\\n\\n 　　We came here to help you!\"\"As I trusted you would,\" he said. \"We have much to discuss.\"Langdon and Sophie seemed unable to tear their stunned gazes from the revolver aimed at them.\\n\\n 　　\"It is simply to ensure your full attention,\" Teabing said. \"If I had wanted to harm you, you wouldbe dead by now. When you walked into my home last night, I risked everything to spare your lives.\\n\\n 　　I am a man of honor, and I vowed in my deepest conscience only to sacrifice those who hadbetrayed the Sangreal.\"\"What are you talking about?\" Langdon said. \"Betrayed the Sangreal?\"\"I discovered a terrible truth,\" Teabing said, sighing. \"I learned why the Sangreal documents werenever revealed to the world. I learned that the Priory had decided not to release the truth after all.\\n\\n 　　That\u0027s why the millennium passed without any revelation, why nothing happened as we entered theEnd of Days.\"Langdon drew a breath, about to protest.\\n\\n 　　\"The Priory,\" Teabing continued, \"was given a sacred charge to share the truth. To release theSangreal documents when the End of Days arrived. For centuries, men like Da Vinci, Botticelli,and Newton risked everything to protect the documents and carry out that charge. And now, at theultimate moment of truth, Jacques Saunière changed his mind. The man honored with the greatestresponsibility in Christian history eschewed his duty. He decided the time was not right.\" Teabingturned to Sophie. \"He failed the Grail. He failed the Priory. And he failed the memory of all thegenerations that had worked to make that moment possible.\"\"You?\" Sophie declared, glancing up now, her green eyes boring into him with rage andrealization. \"You are the one responsible for my grandfather\u0027s murder?\"Teabing scoffed. \"Your grandfather and his sénéchaux were traitors to the Grail.\"Sophie felt a fury rising from deep within. He\u0027s lying!\\n\\n 　　Teabing\u0027s voice was relentless. \"Your grandfather sold out to the Church. It is obvious theypressured him to keep the truth quiet.\"Sophie shook her head. \"The Church had no influence on my grandfather!\"Teabing laughed coldly. \"My dear, the Church has two thousand years of experience pressuringthose who threaten to unveil its lies. Since the days of Constantine, the Church has successfullyhidden the truth about Mary Magdalene and Jesus. We should not be surprised that now, onceagain, they have found a way to keep the world in the dark. The Church may no longer employcrusaders to slaughter non-believers, but their influence is no less persuasive. No less insidious.\"He paused, as if to punctuate his next point. \"Miss Neveu, for some time now your grandfather haswanted to tell you the truth about your family.\"Sophie was stunned. \"How could you know that?\"\"My methods are immaterial. The important thing for you to grasp right now is this.\" He took adeep breath. \"The deaths of your mother, father, grandmother, and brother were not accidental.\"The words sent Sophie\u0027s emotions reeling. She opened her mouth to speak but was unable.\\n\\n 　　Langdon shook his head. \"What are you saying?\"\"Robert, it explains everything. All the pieces fit. History repeats itself. The Church has aprecedent of murder when it comes to silencing the Sangreal. With the End of Days imminent,killing the Grand Master\u0027s loved ones sent a very clear message. Be quiet, or you and Sophie arenext.\"\"It was a car accident,\" Sophie stammered, feeling the childhood pain welling inside her. \"Anaccident!\"\"Bedtime stories to protect your innocence,\" Teabing said. \"Consider that only two familymembers went untouched—the Priory\u0027s Grand Master and his lone granddaughter—the perfect pairto provide the Church with control over the brotherhood. I can only imagine the terror the Churchwielded over your grandfather these past years, threatening to kill you if he dared release theSangreal secret, threatening to finish the job they started unless Saunière influenced the Priory toreconsider its ancient vow.\"\"Leigh,\" Langdon argued, now visibly riled, \"certainly you have no proof that the Church hadanything to do with those deaths, or that it influenced the Priory\u0027s decision to remain silent.\"\"Proof?\" Teabing fired back. \"You want proof the Priory was influenced? The new millennium hasarrived, and yet the world remains ignorant! Is that not proof enough?\"In the echoes of Teabing\u0027s words, Sophie heard another voice speaking. Sophie, I must tell you thetruth about your family. She realized she was trembling. Could this possibly be that truth hergrandfather had wanted to tell her? That her family had been murdered? What did she truly knowabout the crash that took her family? Only sketchy details. Even the stories in the newspaper hadbeen vague. An accident? Bedtime stories? Sophie flashed suddenly on her grandfather\u0027soverprotectiveness, how he never liked to leave her alone when she was young. Even when Sophiewas grown and away at university, she had the sense her grandfather was watching over. Shewondered if there had been Priory members in the shadows throughout her entire life, looking afterher.\\n\\n 　　\"You suspected he was being manipulated,\" Langdon said, glaring with disbelief at Teabing. \"Soyou murdered him?\"\"I did not pull the trigger,\" Teabing said. \"Saunière was dead years ago, when the Church stole hisfamily from him. He was compromised. Now he is free of that pain, released from the shamecaused by his inability to carry out his sacred duty. Consider the alternative. Something had to bedone. Shall the world be ignorant forever? Shall the Church be allowed to cement its lies into ourhistory books for all eternity? Shall the Church be permitted to influence indefinitely with murderand extortion? No, something needed to be done! And now we are poised to carry out Saunière\u0027slegacy and right a terrible wrong.\" He paused. \"The three of us. Together.\"Sophie felt only incredulity. \"How could you possibly believe that we would help you?\"\"Because, my dear, you are the reason the Priory failed to release the documents. Yourgrandfather\u0027s love for you prevented him from challenging the Church. His fear of reprisal againsthis only remaining family crippled him. He never had a chance to explain the truth because yourejected him, tying his hands, making him wait. Now you owe the world the truth. You owe it tothe memory of your grandfather.\"Robert Langdon had given up trying to get his bearings. Despite the torrent of questions runningthrough his mind, he knew only one thing mattered now—getting Sophie out of here alive. All theguilt Langdon had mistakenly felt earlier for involving Teabing had now been transferred toSophie.\\n\\n 　　I took her to Chateau Villette. I am responsible.\\n\\n 　　Langdon could not fathom that Leigh Teabing would be capable of killing them in cold blood herein the Chapter House, and yet Teabing certainly had been involved in killing others during hismisguided quest. Langdon had the uneasy feeling that gunshots in this secluded, thick-walledchamber would go unheard, especially in this rain. And Leigh just admitted his guilt to us.\\n\\n 　　Langdon glanced at Sophie, who looked shaken. The Church murdered Sophie\u0027s family to silencethe Priory? Langdon felt certain the modern Church did not murder people. There had to be someother explanation.\\n\\n 　　\"Let Sophie leave,\" Langdon declared, staring at Leigh. \"You and I should discuss this alone.\"Teabing gave an unnatural laugh. \"I\u0027m afraid that is one show of faith I cannot afford. I can,however, offer you this.\" He propped himself fully on his crutches, gracelessly keeping the gunaimed at Sophie, and removed the keystone from his pocket. He swayed a bit as he held it out forLangdon. \"A token of trust, Robert.\"Robert felt wary and didn\u0027t move. Leigh is giving the keystone back to us?\\n\\n 　　\"Take it,\" Teabing said, thrusting it awkwardly toward Langdon.\\n\\n 　　Langdon could imagine only one reason Teabing would give it back. \"You opened it already. Youremoved the map.\"Teabing was shaking his head. \"Robert, if I had solved the keystone, I would have disappeared tofind the Grail myself and kept you uninvolved. No, I do not know the answer. And I can admit thatfreely. A true knight learns humility in the face of the Grail. He learns to obey the signs placedbefore him. When I saw you enter the abbey, I understood. You were here for a reason. To help. Iam not looking for singular glory here. I serve a far greater master than my own pride. The Truth.\\n\\n 　　Mankind deserves to know that truth. The Grail found us all, and now she is begging to berevealed. We must work together.\"Despite Teabing\u0027s pleas for cooperation and trust, his gun remained trained on Sophie as Langdonstepped forward and accepted the cold marble cylinder. The vinegar inside gurgled as Langdongrasped it and stepped backward. The dials were still in random order, and the cryptex remainedlocked.\\n\\n 　　Langdon eyed Teabing. \"How do you know I won\u0027t smash it right now?\"Teabing\u0027s laugh was an eerie chortle. \"I should have realized your threat to break it in the TempleChurch was an empty one. Robert Langdon would never break the keystone. You are an historian,Robert. You are holding the key to two thousand years of history—the lost key to the Sangreal.\\n\\n 　　You can feel the souls of all the knights burned at the stake to protect her secret. Would you havethem die in vain? No, you will vindicate them. You will join the ranks of the great men youadmire—Da Vinci, Botticelli, Newton—each of whom would have been honored to be in yourshoes right now. The contents of the keystone are crying out to us. Longing to be set free. The timehas come. Destiny has led us to this moment.\"\"I cannot help you, Leigh. I have no idea how to open this. I only saw Newton\u0027s tomb for amoment. And even if I knew the password...\" Langdon paused, realizing he had said too much.\\n\\n 　　\"You would not tell me?\" Teabing sighed. \"I am disappointed and surprised, Robert, that you donot appreciate the extent to which you are in my debt. My task would have been far simpler hadRémy and I eliminated you both when you walked into Chateau Villette. Instead I riskedeverything to take the nobler course.\"\"This is noble?\" Langdon demanded, eyeing the gun.\\n\\n 　　\"Saunière\u0027s fault,\" Teabing said. \"He and his sénéchaux lied to Silas. Otherwise, I would haveobtained the keystone without complication. How was I to imagine the Grand Master would go tosuch ends to deceive me and bequeath the keystone to an estranged granddaughter?\" Teabinglooked at Sophie with disdain. \"Someone so unqualified to hold this knowledge that she required asymbologist baby-sitter.\" Teabing glanced back at Langdon. \"Fortunately, Robert, yourinvolvement turned out to be my saving grace. Rather than the keystone remaining locked in thedepository bank forever, you extracted it and walked into my home.\"Where else would I run? Langdon thought. The community of Grail historians is small, andTeabing and I have a history together.\\n\\n 　　Teabing now looked smug. \"When I learned Saunière left you a dying message, I had a pretty goodidea you were holding valuable Priory information. Whether it was the keystone itself, orinformation on where to find it, I was not sure. But with the police on your heels, I had a sneakingsuspicion you might arrive on my doorstep.\"Langdon glared. \"And if we had not?\"\"I was formulating a plan to extend you a helping hand. One way or another, the keystone wascoming to Chateau Villette. The fact that you delivered it into my waiting hands only serves asproof that my cause is just.\"\"What!\" Langdon was appalled.\\n\\n 　　\"Silas was supposed to break in and steal the keystone from you in Chateau Villette—thusremoving you from the equation without hurting you, and exonerating me from any suspicion ofcomplicity. However, when I saw the intricacy of Saunière\u0027s codes, I decided to include you both inmy quest a bit longer. I could have Silas steal the keystone later, once I knew enough to carry onalone.\"\"The Temple Church,\" Sophie said, her tone awash with betrayal.\\n\\n 　　Light begins to dawn, Teabing thought. The Temple Church was the perfect location to steal thekeystone from Robert and Sophie, and its apparent relevance to the poem made it a plausibledecoy. Rémy\u0027s orders had been clear—stay out of sight while Silas recovers the keystone.\\n\\n 　　Unfortunately, Langdon\u0027s threat to smash the keystone on the chapel floor had caused Rémy topanic. If only Rémy had not revealed himself, Teabing thought ruefully, recalling his own mockkidnapping. Rémy was the sole link to me, and he showed his face!\\n\\n 　　Fortunately, Silas remained unaware of Teabing\u0027s true identity and was easily fooled into takinghim from the church and then watching naively as Rémy pretended to tie their hostage in the backof the limousine. With the soundproof divider raised, Teabing was able to phone Silas in the frontseat, use the fake French accent of the Teacher, and direct Silas to go straight to Opus Dei. Asimple anonymous tip to the police was all it would take to remove Silas from the picture.\\n\\n 　　One loose end tied up.\\n\\n 　　The other loose end was harder. Rémy.\\n\\n 　　Teabing struggled deeply with the decision, but in the end Rémy had proven himself a liability.\\n\\n 　　Every Grail quest requires sacrifice. The cleanest solution had been staring Teabing in the facefrom the limousine\u0027s wet bar—a flask, some cognac, and a can of peanuts. The powder at thebottom of the can would be more than enough to trigger Rémy\u0027s deadly allergy. When Rémyparked the limo on Horse Guards Parade, Teabing climbed out of the back, walked to the sidepassenger door, and sat in the front next to Rémy. Minutes later, Teabing got out of the car,climbed into the rear again, cleaned up the evidence, and finally emerged to carry out the finalphase of his mission.\\n\\n 　　Westminster Abbey had been a short walk, and although Teabing\u0027s leg braces, crutches, and gunhad set off the metal detector, the rent-a-cops never knew what to do. Do we ask him to remove hisbraces and crawl through? Do we frisk his deformed body? Teabing presented the flustered guardsa far easier solution—an embossed card identifying him as Knight of the Realm. The poor fellowspractically tripped over one another ushering him in.\\n\\n 　　Now, eyeing the bewildered Langdon and Neveu, Teabing resisted the urge to reveal how he hadbrilliantly implicated Opus Dei in the plot that would soon bring about the demise of the entireChurch. That would have to wait. Right now there was work to do.\\n\\n 　　\"Mes amis,\" Teabing declared in flawless French, \"vous ne trouvez pas le Saint-Graal, c\u0027est leSaint-Graal qui vous trouve.\" He smiled. \"Our paths together could not be more clear. The Grailhas found us.\"Silence.\\n\\n 　　He spoke to them in a whisper now. \"Listen. Can you hear it? The Grail is speaking to us across thecenturies. She is begging to be saved from the Priory\u0027s folly. I implore you both to recognize thisopportunity. There could not possibly be three more capable people assembled at this moment tobreak the final code and open the cryptex.\" Teabing paused, his eyes alight. \"We need to swear anoath together. A pledge of faith to one another. A knight\u0027s allegiance to uncover the truth and makeit known.\"Sophie stared deep into Teabing\u0027s eyes and spoke in a steely tone. \"I will never swear an oath withmy grandfather\u0027s murderer. Except an oath that I will see you go to prison.\"Teabing\u0027s heart turned grave, then resolute. \"I am sorry you feel that way, mademoiselle.\" Heturned and aimed the gun at Langdon. \"And you, Robert? Are you with me, or against me?\"\\n\\n 雷。提彬爵士从他的\"美杜莎\"左轮手枪枪口望过去，盯着罗伯特。兰登与索菲。奈芙，觉得有些懊悔。\"朋友们。\"他开口说：\"自从昨晚你们闯进我家，我已经尽了最大的努力使你们免于受到伤害。然而现在，你们的执着已让我陷入了困境。\"他看到索菲与兰登脸上露出震惊与被人出卖的无辜表情，然而他还是相信他俩很快就会明白，就是这一连串的事件，将他们三人带到了这些看似不太可能的十字路口上。\\n\\n 我有很多的东西要跟你们两个人说……你们不明白的事情也有很多。\\n\\n \"请相信我。\"提彬继续说：\"我从没想过要把你们牵扯进来。你们跑到我家，就是来找我的吧。\"\"是吗，雷爵士？\"终于，兰登勉强接过话茬：\"你到底要干什么？我们还以为你目前的处境很危险呢。我们是来帮你的啊。\"\"我相信你们会来帮我。\"提彬说：\"有很多事情我们还需要一起讨论呢。\"\\n\\n 兰登与索菲惊惶失措地紧盯着那把对准他们的左轮手枪，一时似乎无法将视线从它身上移开。\\n\\n \"我只想引起你们充分的注意。\"提彬说：\"如果我想伤害你们，那现在你们的小命早玩完了。昨晚你们闯到我家，我拼了老命把你们救出来。我是讲信义的人，我凭良心起誓，我只会让那些出卖圣杯的人沦为牺牲品。\"\"你在胡说什么啊？\"兰登说：\"谁出卖圣杯了？\"\\n\\n \"我发现了一个可怕的事实。\"提彬叹了口气：\"我知道为什么《圣杯文献》从没公开于世人。我也知道为什么郇山隐修会决定，无论如何也决不泄露真相。所以千禧年才能平静地过去，人们没看到任何神示，\"世界末日\"来临时却什么事也没有发生。\"兰登深吸了一口气，想要争辩几句。\\n\\n \"郇山隐修会。\"提彬继续说下去。\"接受了要将真相与世人分享的神圣任务，即在\"世界末日\"来临之际将《圣杯文献》公之于众。几百年来，像达。芬奇、波提切利，以及牛顿这样的人，不顾一切地保护这些文献，并执行那项神圣的任务。然而在真相即将大白的紧要关头，雅克。索尼埃却改变了主意。这位担负了基督教历史上最重大使命的人，最终逃避了自己的责任。他认定将真相公布的时间不很合理。\"提彬转向索菲说：\"他辜负了圣杯，辜负了郇山隐修会，也辜负子曾经努力使这个时刻早日来临的无数代人。\"\"你？\"索菲大声叫道，她终于抬头瞥了他一眼，她绿色的眼睛愤怒地逼视着他，她显然意识到什么了。\"是你害死了我祖父？！\"\\n\\n 提彬冷笑道：\"你祖父和他的护卫长是圣杯的背叛者。\"\\n\\n 索菲顿时觉得怒从心起。他在撒谎！\\n\\n 提彬的语调很是无情：\"你祖父投靠了天主教会，很明显是他们逼他不要泄漏真相的。\"\\n\\n 提彬冷冷地笑了：\"亲爱的，教会镇压那些企图威胁揭穿谎言的人，有着两千多年的历史经验。自康斯坦丁时代以来，教会成功隐瞒了抹大拉的玛丽亚与耶稣基督的有关事实。\\n\\n 如果他们现在再次耍花招欺骗世人，那也用不着大惊小怪。教会也许不会再次雇佣十字军去屠杀异教徒，但它们的影响却丝毫未减，而且采用的手段也同样的阴险。\"他顿了顿，仿佛是要强调接下来的观点：\"奈芙小姐，你祖父想把你家庭的情况告诉你，这已经有-段时间了吧。\"索菲大吃一惊：\"你怎么知道？\"\\n\\n \"我怎么知道的并不重要。眼下对你来说重要的是知道这个。\"他深吸了一口气：\"你父母、你奶奶以及你的兄弟都不是死于意外的车祸。\"索菲乍听此言，百感交集。她张嘴想说，却开不了口。\\n\\n 兰登摇了摇头：\"你在胡说什么呀？！\"\\n\\n \"罗伯特，它可以解释一切。所有的细枝末节都能够说明这一点。历史往往会重复上演。教会每次在要别人对《圣杯文献》保持沉默前，都要暗杀一些人。随着\"世界末日\"的临近，害死大师的亲人等于向他传达了一个明确的信息，嘴巴闭紧一点，否则，接下来遭殃的就是你和你的孙女了。\"\"可他们死于车祸。\"索菲结结巴巴地说，她觉得童年时代遭受的那种痛苦又在心里蔓延开来了。\"是一次意外。\"\\n\\n \"你这是在编造晚间的催眠故事骗你自己呢！你想，一家子就剩下两个人--郇山隐修会的大师和他唯一的孙女--这一对能让教会得以控制同业公会的完美组合安然无恙。我只能想象在过去的这些年里天主教会对你祖父造成了多大的恐惧。他们威胁说，如果他胆敢将圣杯秘密透露出去，就杀死他；他们还威胁说，除非他使郇山隐修会重新考虑他们先前的誓约，否则将即刻来个了断。\"\"雷爵士。\"兰登终于明显被激怒了：\"你肯定没有证据，证明教会跟这些人的死有关，你也没证据证明，是它让郇山隐修会决定保持沉默。\"\"证据？\"提彬激动地反驳道：\"你想要郇山隐修会受到外来影响的证据？新的千禧年已经来临，而世人却依然懵懂无知！这样的证据难道还不够吗？\"\\n\\n 索菲在提彬说话的余音里，听到了另外一个声音。索菲，我必须把你家里的情况告诉你。她意识到自己全身在发抖。这会不会就是祖父一直想告诉她的真相？会不会对她说她的家人是遭人暗算？对于那次夺走她亲人生命的车祸，她又真正了解多少呢？只是一些支离破碎的细节而已。甚至报纸上的报导也已经变得模糊起来。是车祸？抑或是晚间的催眠故事？索菲头脑里闪电一般，突然，她想起祖父一直对她严加保护。在她还小的时候，祖父从不轻易丢下她一个人。甚至在她长大成人，离家上大学期间，她也觉得祖父时时在关注着她。她不知道，在她整个的一生当中，是不是都有郇山隐修会的成员在暗中照顾着她。\\n\\n \"你怀疑他被人操纵了。\"兰登满腹狐疑，朝提彬瞪大了眼睛：\"所以你就把他杀了？\"\\n\\n \"不是我开的枪。多年以前，当天主教会夺走他的亲人时，索尼埃其实就已经死了。他终于屈服了。现在，他总算摆脱了无法完成神圣使命的耻辱给他带来的痛苦。你想，他必须在二者之间作出选择。他总得做些什么吧。难道世人愿意永远被蒙蔽下去吗？难道世人会允许教会将他们的谎言永远载人历史教科书里去吗？难道世人会允许天主教会以谋杀及巧取豪夺的手段对外施加影响吗？不，我们必须采取一些应变措施。现在，我们正准备继承索尼埃先生的遗志，将犯下的可怕错误纠正过来。\"他停了片刻，又说：\"而这就得看我们三人是否齐心协力了。\"索菲除了怀疑还是怀疑：\"你怎么知道我们会帮你？\"\\n\\n \"亲爱的，因为你的缘故，郇山隐修会才没能将《圣杯文献》公之于众。你祖父对你的关爱，使他没有勇气去挑战天主教会，因为他担心教会会对他唯一的亲人进行报复，这种恐惧挫败了他。然而他从未找到机会跟你解释，因为你排斥他，从而束缚了他的手脚，让他只有耐心地等了。现在，你必须向世界澄清一个事实，以告慰你祖父的在天之灵。\"罗伯特。兰登已经放弃了准备承受重担的努力。尽管在他的脑海里闪过无数的疑问，然而他知道，眼下只有一件事情对他是重要的了--那就是让索菲从这里活着出去。他所有的内疚，所有原先误以为是他连累了提彬而引发的内疚，现在统统转移到索菲的头上去了。\\n\\n 是我带她去维莱特庄园，我必须承担起这个责任。\\n\\n 兰登揣摩不透，不知道雷。提彬究竟有没有能力，将他们残忍地杀死在牧师会礼堂里。\\n\\n 不过，在被人误导的探索过程中，他肯定参与过杀人。一想到这间偏僻的、四周都是厚厚高墙的屋子里，即使枪声响起外面也听不到时--更糟糕的是外面还下着雨，兰登就不安起来。何况提彬的罪行他刚才向我们坦白过了。\\n\\n 兰登瞥了索菲一眼，她全身似乎还在发抖。难道教会杀害索菲的家人，就是为了堵上郇山隐修会的嘴吗？兰登确信现代的天主教会是不会杀人的，因此其中必定有其他的缘由。\\n\\n \"放索菲走。\"兰登怒视着提彬，大声喝道：\"你我两人得就这个问题私下里谈谈。\"\\n\\n 提彬极不自然地笑起来：\"这恐怕涉及到信誉问题了，这样的风险我赔不起，不过我可以把这个给你。\"他将整个身子都靠在拐杖上，却仍然毫无绅士风度地拿枪对准了索菲。他从口袋里掏出拱心石，晃了晃，这才把它递给了兰登。\"罗伯特，这是我信得过你的表现。\"\\n\\n 罗伯特。兰登满怀戒心，没有伸手去接。雷。提彬打算把拱心石还给我们？\\n\\n \"你快拿着。\"提彬说着，笨拙的把拱心石硬塞过来。\\n\\n 兰登只想到一个提彬愿意将拱心石还给他们的原因。\"你已经把它打开过了。你把地图拿走了是吧？\"\\n\\n 提彬摇摇头说：\"如果我解开了拱心石的谜，我也许早就不在这里，而是独自去寻找圣杯，不需要让你们插手了。真正的骑士在圣杯面前学会了谦卑。他学会了该如何根据出现在他面前的征兆行事。当我看到你们走进教堂，我便明白了，你们是来帮我的忙的。我并不是为了维护我的尊严，而是为真相这位更伟大的主人服务的。人类有权知道历史的真相。是圣杯找到了我们，现在它在请求我们将它向世人公开，因此我们应该携起手来。\"虽然提彬一再要求合作、彼此信任，然而当兰登走上前去接过冷冰冰的拱心石时，他始终把枪对准了索菲。兰登猛地抓过拱心石，往后退去，这时瓶里的醋发出\"咕咚咕咚\"的响声。刻度盘依然杂乱无章，然而密码盒原封不动。\\n\\n 兰登看了看提彬，说：\"你怎么知道我现在不会把它砸碎？\"\\n\\n 提彬发出一阵得意的怪笑：\"你威胁说要砸毁拱心石，还在圣殿教堂时我就已经意识到你不过是在虚张声势罢了。罗伯特。兰登怎么会砸毁拱心石呢？你是位历史学家，你手中掌握了开启两千年历史的钥匙--是一把借以找到圣杯的失而复得的钥匙。从中你能感受到为严守它的秘密而被活活烧死在火刑柱上的所有骑士的灵魂。你会让他们死得毫无价值吗？不，你不会的。相反，你会维护他们。你会加入你所崇拜的伟人，如达。芬奇、波提切利、牛顿他们的行列。他们当中的每一个人，都会对你眼下的处境感到光荣。拱心石在大声召唤着我们，它渴望得到自由。这时刻现在已经来到了。是命运，给了我们这样千载难逢的机会。\"\"雷爵士，我不能帮你，我不知道怎么把它打开。牛顿爵士的坟墓我也只看了一会儿。\\n\\n 再说，就算我知道密码--\"兰登停了下来，意识到自己说得太多了。\\n\\n \"你也不会告诉我是不是？\"提彬叹了口气：\"罗伯特，我很失望，也很奇怪，你竟然毫不买我的账呢。要是在你们闯入维莱特庄园之前，我和雷米把你们结果了，那我现在的任务就简单多了。可我当时却不顾一切，选择了一条正道，更为光明磊落。\"\"你这也叫光明磊落？\"兰登盯着枪质问道。\\n\\n \"这都是索尼埃的错。\"提彬继续说道：\"他和他的护卫长向塞拉斯撒了谎。要不然我也许会毫不费事地将拱心石弄到手。我怎么会想到这位大师竟然欺骗我，把拱心石留给他素来不合的孙女儿？\"他轻蔑的看了索菲一眼：\"罗伯特，幸好有你参与进来，多少给了我一些补偿。你没让拱心石永远被锁在银行的保险柜里，而是将它取出，并跑到我家来。\"兰登心想，我还能去哪里呢？对圣杯史有所了解的历史学家少而又少，唯有提彬和我都知道它的历史。\\n\\n 提彬看上去有点得意：\"当我得知索尼埃临死之前给你留下话时，我就清楚，你手中一定掌握了很有价值的郇山隐修会的资料。至于是不是与拱心石有关，或者与到哪里去寻找拱心石有关，我就不敢肯定了。不过，当我看到警察在后面追踪你们，我就在心里怀疑你们可能会来我家了。\"兰登怒目而视：\"要是我们没去你家呢？\"\\n\\n \"我当时就在想方设法向你们伸出援手，不管怎样，拱心石最后还是来到了维莱特庄园。你们把它送到我期待已久的手中，这只能证明我当初的方向是正确的。\"\"你说什么！\"兰登大惊失色。\\n\\n \"塞拉斯按照预先定好的计划，突然闯进维莱特庄园，从你们手中夺走了拱心石，因此一方面使你们免于受到伤害，另一方面也给我开脱了罪责，也使你们不至于怀疑我在跟塞拉斯串通一气。不过，当我看到索尼埃设置的密码有多复杂时，我决定再利用你们一会。\\n\\n 一旦我知道可以单独干下去时，稍后我也许就会派塞拉斯来盗走拱心石。\"\"所以你选择在圣殿教堂下手。\"索菲愤愤地说，语气里充满了被人出卖的懊恼。\\n\\n 曙光就要来临了，提彬心想。圣殿教堂无疑是他从罗伯特。兰登和索菲。奈芙手中夺取拱心石的最佳地点，而教堂与那首诗的明显联系又使它成为一个似是而非的陷阱。他对雷米交代得很清楚--那就是在塞拉斯夺回拱心石时躲起来。然而不幸的是，当兰登威胁着要把拱心石砸烂时，雷米吓坏了。要是雷米没有露脸，那该多好啊！提彬回想起自导自演的那场绑架游戏，不由懊悔地想。雷米是我对外的唯一联系人，可他竟然暴露了自己的身份！\\n\\n 幸运的是，塞拉斯还不知道提彬的真实身份，因而轻而易举地受了骗，并将他带离教堂，然后又傻乎乎地在一边看着雷米假装将人质绑在轿车的后面。隔音的屏障在他们中间一竖起来，他就可以给坐在汽车前排的塞拉斯打电话了，他模仿教主的法国口音，命令塞拉斯径直去天主事工会。然后，他只需要向警方挂个匿名电话，就可以让塞拉斯永远的从他的视线里消失。\\n\\n 这样，松开的一端线被绑紧了。\\n\\n 但更难对付的是松开的另一端线，那就是雷米。\\n\\n 提彬内心激烈地挣扎着，想尽快做出决定，但雷米最终证明自己是个沉重的包袱。在找寻圣杯的过程中，每次总得有人做出牺牲。早在提彬看到车中酒吧柜里的酒瓶、法国白兰地酒以及一听花生罐头时，他就想好了最妥帖的解决方法。罐子底下的药粉会更有效地触动雷米过于敏感的神经，并给他致命的一击。雷米把车停在骑兵校阅场时，提彬从后面爬了出来，走到供乘客出入的车门，然后坐到前排靠近雷米的座位。几分钟后，提彬从车里钻出来，又重新爬到车子后面。他清除掉所有可疑的痕迹，然后着手完成最后的计划。\\n\\n 威斯敏斯特教堂并不远。尽管提彬绑在腿上的支架、拐杖和手枪引起了金属检测器的反应，然而那些酒囊饭袋一碰到事情就不知该如何处理。我们要不要让他解下支架爬进去？要不要搜查他有残疾的身体呢？倒是提彬教给这些狼狈不堪的保卫人员一个更简便的解决方法--他拿出一张表明自己是王国骑士的印有浮凸印章的身份卡，这些可怜的家伙差点没被吓得晕倒，便手忙脚乱地将他放了进去。\\n\\n 此刻，提彬看着茫然不知所措的兰登和索菲，拼命抑制住内心的冲动，他本想告诉他们，他是如何巧妙地把天主事工会卷入到即将给天主教会带来灭顶之灾的阴谋中来。但他们还得等待一段时间。现在，他们还有其他事情要先去做。\\n\\n \"朋友们。\"提彬用极纯正的法语大声说：\"不是你们去找圣杯，而是圣杯自动找你们来了。\"他微笑了一下：\"现在我们只有通力合作，这是再清楚没有的了。圣杯已经找上我们的门来了。\"没有人搭他的话，只有沉默。\\n\\n 他转而低声地说：\"听着，你们听到我说话吗？圣杯穿越了数个世纪，正在跟我们说话哩。它要求摆脱郇山隐修会的愚弄。我恳求你们抓住这个机会。现在，是不可能找得到三个比我们更能干的人聚在一起，破译最后的密码，来打开这个密码盒了。\"他停下来，双目低垂。\"我们得一起发誓。彼此之间信守诺言。我将以骑士的拳拳之心，努力揭开历史的真相，告知于世人。\"索菲深深地望了提彬一眼，斩钉截铁地说：\"我决不会和杀害我祖父的凶手一起宣誓。\\n\\n 我只希望他日能在监狱里看到你。\"提彬神情顿时变得凝重，然后又果断起来：\"女士，我对你的想法深感抱歉。\"他转过身，拿枪对准了兰登：\"罗伯特，你怎么样？你到底是跟我呢，还是不跟我？\\n\\n \\n\\n
