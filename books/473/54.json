{"id":30194,"no":54,"title":"Chapter 53","content":"\"Monsieur Vernet!\" The night manager of the Depository Bank of Zurich felt relieved to hear thebank president\u0027s voice on the phone. \"Where did you go, sir? The police are here, everyone iswaiting for you!\"\"I have a little problem,\" the bank president said, sounding distressed. \"I need your help rightaway.\"You have more than a little problem, the manager thought. The police had entirely surrounded thebank and were threatening to have the DCPJ captain himself show up with the warrant the bankhad demanded. \"How can I help you, sir?\"\"Armored truck number three. I need to find it.\"Puzzled, the manager checked his delivery schedule. \"It\u0027s here. Downstairs at the loading dock.\"\"Actually, no. The truck was stolen by the two individuals the police are tracking.\"\"What? How did they drive out?\"\"I can\u0027t go into the specifics on the phone, but we have a situation here that could potentially beextremely unfortunate for the bank.\"\"What do you need me to do, sir?\"\"I\u0027d like you to activate the truck\u0027s emergency transponder.\"The night manager\u0027s eyes moved to the LoJack control box across the room. Like many armoredcars, each of the bank\u0027s trucks had been equipped with a radio-controlled homing device, whichcould be activated remotely from the bank. The manager had only used the emergency systemonce, after a hijacking, and it had worked flawlessly—locating the truck and transmitting thecoordinates to the authorities automatically. Tonight, however, the manager had the impression thepresident was hoping for a bit more prudence. \"Sir, you are aware that if I activate the LoJacksystem, the transponder will simultaneously inform the authorities that we have a problem.\"Vernet was silent for several seconds. \"Yes, I know. Do it anyway. Truck number three. I\u0027ll hold. Ineed the exact location of that truck the instant you have it.\"\"Right away, sir.\"Thirty seconds later, forty kilometers away, hidden in the undercarriage of the armored truck, a tinytransponder blinked to life.\n 银行夜间值班经理听到行长的声音从电话中传来，长吁了一口气。\"韦尔内先生！您到哪儿去了？警察来了，大家都在等您呢！\"\"我碰到个小问题。\"行长有些哀伤地说道。\"我现在急需你的帮助。\"\n 你的问题可不小，经理想。警察已经把银行包围了，并威胁说会让警署上尉亲自把银行搜查令带来。\"您要我怎样帮您，先生？\"\n \"三号装甲车不见了。我得找到它。\"\n 经理疑惑地核对了一下发货时刻表。\"它在这里呀。就在地下装货台。\"\n \"实际上不在。那辆车被警察正在追捕的人偷走了。\"\n \"什么？他们是怎么开走的？\"\n \"电话里说不清楚，但这件事有可能会对我们银行造成非常不利的影响。\"\n \"那您要我做什么呢？先生。\"\n \"你启动那辆车的紧急雷达监视器。\"\n 经理看着对面墙边上的控制箱。跟其他装甲车一样，这家银行的装甲车也安装了无线电控制的自动导引装置，这个装置可以由银行自动开启。这位经理只在银行遭到抢劫后用过一次这个紧急启动系统。那次，系统情况运转良好，很快地找到了那辆车，并自动把车的方位报告给了警方。可是今晚，经理觉得行长理应更谨慎一点。\"先生，您要知道，如果我启动了自动搜索系统，那个雷达监视器就会自动通知警方我们这里出了事。\"韦尔内沉默了一会儿，然后说道：\"是的，我知道。开吧。三号车。我不挂电话。发现那辆车的确切位置就马上告诉我。\"\"我马上启动，先生。\"\n 三十秒钟之后，四十公里外，一辆装甲车下的小雷达启动了。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8606.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
