{"id":30185,"no":45,"title":"Chapter 44","content":"\"Ten digits,\" Sophie said, her cryptologic senses tingling as she studied the printout. 　　13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5Grand-père wrote his account number on the Louvre floor! 　　When Sophie had first seen the scrambled Fibonacci sequence on the parquet, she had assumed itssole purpose was to encourage DCPJ to call in their cryptographers and get Sophie involved. Later,she realized the numbers were also a clue as to how to decipher the other lines—a sequence out oforder... a numeric anagram. Now, utterly amazed, she saw the numbers had a more importantmeaning still. They were almost certainly the final key to opening her grandfather\u0027s mysterious safe-deposit box. 　　\"He was the master of double-entendres,\" Sophie said, turning to Langdon. \"He loved anythingwith multiple layers of meaning. Codes within codes.\"Langdon was already moving toward the electronic podium near the conveyor belt. Sophie grabbedthe computer printout and followed. 　　The podium had a keypad similar to that of a bank ATM terminal. The screen displayed the bank\u0027scruciform logo. Beside the keypad was a triangular hole. Sophie wasted no time inserting the shaftof her key into the hole. 　　The screen refreshed instantly. 　　ACCOUNT NUMBER: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _The cursor blinked. Waiting. 　　Ten digits. Sophie read the numbers off the printout, and Langdon typed them in. 　　ACCOUNT NUMBER: 1332211185When he had typed the last digit, the screen refreshed again. A message in several languagesappeared. English was on top. 　　CAUTION: 　　Before you strike the enter key, please check the accuracy of youraccount number. 　　For your own security, if the computer does not recognize youraccount number, this system will automatically shut down. 　　\"Fonction terminer,\" Sophie said, frowning. \"Looks like we only get one try.\" Standard ATMmachines allowed users three attempts to type a PIN before confiscating their bank card. This wasobviously no ordinary cash machine. 　　\"The number looks right,\" Langdon confirmed, carefully checking what they had typed andcomparing it to the printout. He motioned to the ENTER key. \"Fire away.\"Sophie extended her index finger toward the keypad, but hesitated, an odd thought now hitting her. 　　\"Go ahead,\" Langdon urged. \"Vernet will be back soon.\"\"No.\" She pulled her hand away. \"This isn\u0027t the right account number.\"\"Of course it is! Ten digits. What else would it be?\"\"It\u0027s too random.\"Too random? Langdon could not have disagreed more. Every bank advised its customers to choosePINs at random so nobody could guess them. Certainly clients here would be advised to choosetheir account numbers at random. 　　Sophie deleted everything she had just typed in and looked up at Langdon, her gaze self-assured. 　　\"It\u0027s far too coincidental that this supposedly random account number could be rearranged to formthe Fibonacci sequence.\"Langdon realized she had a point. Earlier, Sophie had rearranged this account number into theFibonacci sequence. What were the odds of being able to do that? 　　Sophie was at the keypad again, entering a different number, as if from memory. \"Moreover, withmy grandfather\u0027s love of symbolism and codes, it seems to follow that he would have chosen anaccount number that had meaning to him, something he could easily remember.\" She finishedtyping the entry and gave a sly smile. \"Something that appeared random... but was not.\" Langdonlooked at the screen. 　　ACCOUNT NUMBER: 1123581321It took him an instant, but when Langdon spotted it, he knew she was right. 　　The Fibonacci sequence. 　　1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21When the Fibonacci sequence was melded into a single ten-digit number, it became virtuallyunrecognizable. Easy to remember, and yet seemingly random. A brilliant ten-digit code thatSaunière would never forget. Furthermore, it perfectly explained why the scrambled numbers onthe Louvre floor could be rearranged to form the famous progression. 　　Sophie reached down and pressed the ENTER key. 　　Nothing happened. 　　At least nothing they could detect. 　　At that moment, beneath them, in the bank\u0027s cavernous subterranean vault, a robotic claw sprang tolife. Sliding on a double-axis transport system attached to the ceiling, the claw headed off in searchof the proper coordinates. On the cement floor below, hundreds of identical plastic crates layaligned on an enormous grid... like rows of small coffins in an underground crypt. 　　Whirring to a stop over the correct spot on the floor, the claw dropped down, an electric eyeconfirming the bar code on the box. Then, with computer precision, the claw grasped the heavyhandle and hoisted the crate vertically. New gears engaged, and the claw transported the box to thefar side of the vault, coming to a stop over a stationary conveyor belt. 　　Gently now, the retrieval arm set down the crate and retracted. 　　Once the arm was clear, the conveyor belt whirred to life.... 　　Upstairs, Sophie and Langdon exhaled in relief to see the conveyor belt move. Standing beside thebelt, they felt like weary travelers at baggage claim awaiting a mysterious piece of luggage whosecontents were unknown. 　　The conveyor belt entered the room on their right through a narrow slit beneath a retractable door. 　　The metal door slid up, and a huge plastic box appeared, emerging from the depths on the inclinedconveyor belt. The box was black, heavy molded plastic, and far larger than she imagined. Itlooked like an air-freight pet transport crate without any airholes. 　　The box coasted to a stop directly in front of them. 　　Langdon and Sophie stood there, silent, staring at the mysterious container. 　　Like everything else about this bank, this crate was industrial—metal clasps, a bar code sticker ontop, and molded heavy-duty handle. Sophie thought it looked like a giant toolbox. 　　Wasting no time, Sophie unhooked the two buckles facing her. Then she glanced over at Langdon. 　　Together, they raised the heavy lid and let it fall back. 　　Stepping forward, they peered down into the crate. 　　At first glance, Sophie thought the crate was empty. Then she saw something. Sitting at the bottomof the crate. A lone item. 　　The polished wooden box was about the size of a shoebox and had ornate hinges. The wood was alustrous deep purple with a strong grain. Rosewood, Sophie realized. Her grandfather\u0027s favorite. 　　The lid bore a beautiful inlaid design of a rose. She and Langdon exchanged puzzled looks. Sophieleaned in and grabbed the box, lifting it out. 　　My God, it\u0027s heavy! 　　She carried it gingerly to a large receiving table and set it down. Langdon stood beside her, both ofthem staring at the small treasure chest her grandfather apparently had sent them to retrieve. 　　Langdon stared in wonderment at the lid\u0027s hand-carved inlay—a five-petal rose. He had seen thistype of rose many times. \"The five-petal rose,\" he whispered, \"is a Priory symbol for the HolyGrail.\"Sophie turned and looked at him. Langdon could see what she was thinking, and he was thinking ittoo. The dimensions of the box, the apparent weight of its contents, and a Priory symbol for theGrail all seemed to imply one unfathomable conclusion. The Cup of Christ is in this wooden box. 　　Langdon again told himself it was impossible. 　　\"It\u0027s a perfect size,\" Sophie whispered, \"to hold... a chalice.\"It can\u0027t be a chalice. 　　Sophie pulled the box toward her across the table, preparing to open it. As she moved it, though,something unexpected happened. The box let out an odd gurgling sound. 　　Langdon did a double take. There\u0027s liquid inside? 　　Sophie looked equally confused. \"Did you just hear...?\"Langdon nodded, lost. \"Liquid.\"Reaching forward, Sophie slowly unhooked the clasp and raised the lid. 　　The object inside was unlike anything Langdon had ever seen. One thing was immediately clear toboth of them, however. This was definitely not the Cup of Christ. \"确实是十位数。\"索菲说道。当她仔细地查看那张照片时，对密码学的感觉被唤醒了。 13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5祖父把账号写在了卢浮宫的地板上！ 当索菲第一次在卢浮宫的木地板上看到这个凌乱的斐波那契数列时，以为这串数字的唯一目的只是让警署请密码员来参与侦破，从而让索菲有机会参与其中。后来，她认识到这些数字还是破解另外几行词句的线索--一个打破顺序的序列……一个数字之谜。现在，更加使她惊异的是，她发现这些数字还有一个更重要的含意。几乎可以肯定，这些数字肯定是打开祖父的神秘保险箱的关键。 \"他是使用双关语的大师。\"索菲转过身对兰登说道。\"他喜欢有多层意思的东西。喜欢在密码里套密码。\"此时，兰登已走近了传送带边上的计算机装置。索菲抓起那张电脑打印的照片，跟了上去。 那个装置的键盘和银行自动取款机的键盘相似。显示屏上显示着十字形标志。键盘旁边有一个三角形的孔。索菲毫不犹豫地把钥匙插进那个孔里。 屏幕马上刷新了。 账号：----------光标闪烁等待着。 十位数。索菲念着照片上的数字，兰登把它们输了进去。 账号：1332211185最后一个数字输入完毕后，屏幕又刷新了，出现了用几种不同的语言写成的信息。最上面的一段是英语。 注意：在按确认键之前，请核对您输入的账号是否准确。 如果计算机无法识别您的账号，为了安全，系统将自动关闭。 \"终审判决。\"索菲皱着眉头说道。\"看来我们只有一次机会。\"普通的自动提款机一般都会允许用户输入三次密码，然后才会没收他们的银行卡。不过，这一台显然不是普通的取款机。 兰登对照着照片上的数字仔细地核对输入，确认无误后，他说道：\"数字没错。\" 他指了指确认键。\"按吧。\" 索菲把食指伸向键盘，但一种奇怪的感觉突然袭来，她犹豫了。 \"按呀。\"兰登催促道。\"韦尔内马上就回来了。\" \"不对。\"她把手指拿开。\"这个账号不正确。\" \"肯定对！十位数。还会是什么？\" \"这个账号太没有规律了。\" 太没有规律？兰登不同意这个说法。每家银行都会建议他们的用户随机选择密码，这样就不会被人猜到。这家银行当然也会建议用户随机选择密码。 索菲删除了刚刚输进去的所有数字，抬头看着兰登，目光中流露出自信。\"这个理应很随意的账号竟能重新排列成斐波那契数列，这也太偶然了吧？\" 兰登明白她已有了主意。来这里之前，索菲就曾把这组数字排成了斐波那契数列。随便一组数字能排列成斐波那契数列的可能性有大呢？ 索菲又敲起了键盘，边回忆边输入了一组不同的数字。\"而且，就祖父对符号学和密码的偏爱来说，他应该会选择一组对他来说有意义的、容易记住的数字。\"把数字全部输进去之后，她狡猾地笑了一下。\"看上去很随意，但实际不然。\" 兰登看了看屏幕。 账号：1123581321兰登一时没看懂。可是当他回过神，就明白索菲所言极是。 斐波那契数列：1-1-2-3-5-8-13-2l当斐波那契数列混合成一组十项数字的组合时，根本就无法辨认。容易记住，但从表面看却很随意！这是一个永远都不会被忘记的极为巧妙的十位数密码。而且，这也充分说明了为什么卢浮宫地板上那组凌乱的数字可以重新排列成这著名的数列。 索菲伸出手按下确认键。 毫无动静。 至少他们没有觉察出有什么动静。 就在那一刻，在他们脚下的那个巨大地下金库里，一个机械手被激活了。这个机械手在双轴传送装置上滑动着，寻找与输入账号相匹配的保险箱。金库里，上千个一模一样的塑料箱子在巨大的铁架上排成一行，看上去就像教堂地下室里的一排排灵柩。 机械手迅速地移动到正确方位，然后垂了下来，用电子眼确认了一下上面的条形码。 接着，机械手非常准确地抓起箱子沉重的把手，把箱子直直地提了起来。传送装置上的齿轮转动着，机械手把箱子运到金库的另一头，然后在一个静止的传送带上方停了下来。 机械手轻轻地放下箱子，收了回去。 紧接着，传送带迅速地转动了起来…… 兰登和索菲看到传送带转了起来，长出了一口气。他们站在传送带旁，就像在行李提取处等待神秘行李的疲惫旅客。 传送带从一个伸缩门下面的窄缝里穿进来，延伸到他们右侧。铁门滑了开来，一个很大的塑料箱子从倾斜的传送带上运了过来。那个箱子是个笨重的黑色塑料箱，比索菲想象的要大得多，就像一个没有气孔的宠物空运箱。 箱子沿斜坡滑到他们面前。 兰登和索菲静静地站在那里注视着这个神秘的箱子。 跟这家银行的其他东西一样，这个箱子的所有零部件--从铁扣到顶端的不干胶条形码以及结实的把手一一-都是由机械制造的。索菲觉得它就像一个巨大的工具箱。 索菲迅速地打开箱子上面的两个扣，看了一眼兰登。然后，两个人一起抬起沉重的盖子，向后掀开。 他们走上前，朝箱子里望去。 索菲看第一眼时，还以为箱子是空的。不过，接下来她在箱子底上看到了一件东西。 那是个打磨光滑的木盒，有鞋盒那么大，配着精美的合页。木头是深紫色的，发着黯淡的光，上面有粗线条的纹理。紫檀木，索菲认了出来。这是祖父最喜爱的木材。盒盖上镶嵌着一朵美丽的玫瑰花图案。她和兰登交换了一下困惑的眼神。索菲侧过身，拿起盒子仔细端详。 天哪，它竟然很沉！ 索菲小心翼翼地把盒子放到大桌子上。兰登站到她身边，和她一起目不转睛地盯着这个小小的财宝箱。这就是祖父要他们来拿的东西！ 兰登惊异地看着盒盖上手工雕刻的图案--那是一朵五瓣玫瑰。他以前曾多次看到过这种玫瑰的图案。他低声说道：\"五瓣玫瑰。这是隐修会用来代表圣杯的标志呀。\" 索菲转过身，看着他。兰登看得出索菲的心思，他也有相同的疑虑。盒子的大小、重量以及隐修会代表圣杯的标志似乎都暗示着一个不可思议的结论。耶稣的圣杯就在这个木盒子里！兰登再一次告诉自己这是不可能的。 索菲低声说道：\"这个盒子倒是挺适合放圣杯。\" 但里面不可能是圣杯。 索菲把盒子拽过来，准备打开。可是，就在她拖动盒子的时候，意想不到的事情发生了。盒子里传出汩汩的水声。 兰登把盒子拿起来。里面有液体？ 索菲也感到迷惑不解。\"刚才你有没有听到……\" 兰登困惑地点点头。\"液体。\" 索菲伸手慢慢地打开盒扣，掀起盖子。 里面的东西是兰登从没见过的。然而，可以肯定的是那绝对不是圣杯。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8597.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
