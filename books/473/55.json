{"id":30195,"no":55,"title":"Chapter 54","content":"As Langdon and Sophie drove the armored truck up the winding, poplar-lined driveway toward thehouse, Sophie could already feel her muscles relaxing. It was a relief to be off the road, and shecould think of few safer places to get their feet under them than this private, gated estate owned bya good-natured foreigner. 　　They turned into the sweeping circular driveway, and Chateau Villette came into view on theirright. Three stories tall and at least sixty meters long, the edifice had gray stone facing illuminatedby outside spotlights. The coarse facade stood in stark juxtaposition to the immaculatelylandscaped gardens and glassy pond. 　　The inside lights were just now coming on. 　　Rather than driving to the front door, Langdon pulled into a parking area nestled in the evergreens. 　　\"No reason to risk being spotted from the road,\" he said. \"Or having Leigh wonder why we arrivedin a wrecked armored truck.\"Sophie nodded. \"What do we do with the cryptex? We probably shouldn\u0027t leave it out here, but ifLeigh sees it, he\u0027ll certainly want to know what it is.\"\"Not to worry,\" Langdon said, removing his jacket as he stepped out of the car. He wrapped thetweed coat around the box and held the bundle in his arms like a baby. 　　Sophie looked dubious. \"Subtle.\"\"Teabing never answers his own door; he prefers to make an entrance. I\u0027ll find somewhere inside tostash this before he joins us.\" Langdon paused. \"Actually, I should probably warn you before youmeet him. Sir Leigh has a sense of humor that people often find a bit... strange.\"Sophie doubted anything tonight would strike her as strange anymore. 　　The pathway to the main entrance was hand-laid cobblestone. It curved to a door of carved oak andcherry with a brass knocker the size of a grapefruit. Before Sophie could grasp the knocker, thedoor swung open from within. 　　A prim and elegant butler stood before them, making final adjustments on the white tie and tuxedohe had apparently just donned. He looked to be about fifty, with refined features and an austereexpression that left little doubt he was unamused by their presence here. 　　\"Sir Leigh will be down presently,\" he declared, his accent thick French. \"He is dressing. Heprefers not to greet visitors while wearing only a nightshirt. May I take your coat?\" He scowled atthe bunched-up tweed in Langdon\u0027s arms. 　　\"Thank you, I\u0027m fine.\"\"Of course you are. Right this way, please.\"The butler guided them through a lush marble foyer into an exquisitely adorned drawing room,softly lit by tassel-draped Victorian lamps. The air inside smelled antediluvian, regal somehow,with traces of pipe tobacco, tea leaves, cooking sherry, and the earthen aroma of stone architecture. 　　Against the far wall, flanked between two glistening suits of chain mail armor, was a rough-hewnfireplace large enough to roast an ox. Walking to the hearth, the butler knelt and touched a match toa pre-laid arrangement of oak logs and kindling. A fire quickly crackled to life. 　　The man stood, straightening his jacket. \"His master requests that you make yourselves at home.\"With that, he departed, leaving Langdon and Sophie alone. 　　Sophie wondered which of the fireside antiques she was supposed to sit on—the Renaissancevelvet divan, the rustic eagle-claw rocker, or the pair of stone pews that looked like they\u0027d beenlifted from some Byzantine temple. 　　Langdon unwrapped the cryptex from his coat, walked to the velvet divan, and slid the wooden boxdeep underneath it, well out of sight. Then, shaking out his jacket, he put it back on, smoothed thelapels, and smiled at Sophie as he sat down directly over the stashed treasure. 　　The divan it is, Sophie thought, taking a seat beside him. 　　As she stared into the growing fire, enjoying the warmth, Sophie had the sensation that hergrandfather would have loved this room. The dark wood paneling was bedecked with Old Masterpaintings, one of which Sophie recognized as a Poussin, her grandfather\u0027s second-favorite painter. 　　On the mantel above the fireplace, an alabaster bust of Isis watched over the room. 　　Beneath the Egyptian goddess, inside the fireplace, two stone gargoyles served as andirons, theirmouths gaping to reveal their menacing hollow throats. Gargoyles had always terrified Sophie as achild; that was, until her grandfather cured her of the fear by taking her atop Notre Dame Cathedralin a rainstorm. \"Princess, look at these silly creatures,\" he had told her, pointing to the gargoylerainspouts with their mouths gushing water. \"Do you hear that funny sound in their throats?\"Sophie nodded, having to smile at the burping sound of the water gurgling through their throats. 　　\"They\u0027re gargling,\" her grandfather told her. \"Gargariser! And that\u0027s where they get the silly name\u0027gargoyles.\u0027 \" Sophie had never again been afraid. 　　The fond memory caused Sophie a pang of sadness as the harsh reality of the murder gripped heragain. Grand-père is gone. She pictured the cryptex under the divan and wondered if LeighTeabing would have any idea how to open it. Or if we even should ask him. Sophie\u0027s grandfather\u0027sfinal words had instructed her to find Robert Langdon. He had said nothing about involving anyoneelse. We needed somewhere to hide, Sophie said, deciding to trust Robert\u0027s judgment. 　　\"Sir Robert!\" a voice bellowed somewhere behind them. \"I see you travel with a maiden.\"Langdon stood up. Sophie jumped to her feet as well. The voice had come from the top of a curledstaircase that snaked up to the shadows of the second floor. At the top of the stairs, a form movedin the shadows, only his silhouette visible. 　　\"Good evening,\" Langdon called up. \"Sir Leigh, may I present Sophie Neveu.\"\"An honor.\" Teabing moved into the light. 　　\"Thank you for having us,\" Sophie said, now seeing the man wore metal leg braces and usedcrutches. He was coming down one stair at a time. \"I realize it\u0027s quite late.\"\"It is so late, my dear, it\u0027s early.\" He laughed. \"Vous n\u0027êtes pas Américaine?\"Sophie shook her head. \"Parisienne.\"\"Your English is superb.\"\"Thank you. I studied at the Royal Holloway.\"\"So then, that explains it.\" Teabing hobbled lower through the shadows. \"Perhaps Robert told you Ischooled just down the road at Oxford.\" Teabing fixed Langdon with a devilish smile. \"Of course, Ialso applied to Harvard as my safety school.\"Their host arrived at the bottom of the stairs, appearing to Sophie no more like a knight than SirElton John. Portly and ruby-faced, Sir Leigh Teabing had bushy red hair and jovial hazel eyes thatseemed to twinkle as he spoke. He wore pleated pants and a roomy silk shirt under a paisley vest. 　　Despite the aluminum braces on his legs, he carried himself with a resilient, vertical dignity thatseemed more a by-product of noble ancestry than any kind of conscious effort. 　　Teabing arrived and extended a hand to Langdon. \"Robert, you\u0027ve lost weight.\"Langdon grinned. \"And you\u0027ve found some.\"Teabing laughed heartily, patting his rotund belly. \"Touché. My only carnal pleasures these daysseem to be culinary.\" Turning now to Sophie, he gently took her hand, bowing his head slightly,breathing lightly on her fingers, and diverting his eyes. \"M\u0027lady.\"Sophie glanced at Langdon, uncertain whether she\u0027d stepped back in time or into a nuthouse. 　　The butler who had answered the door now entered carrying a tea service, which he arranged on atable in front of the fireplace. 　　\"This is Rémy Legaludec,\" Teabing said, \"my manservant.\"The slender butler gave a stiff nod and disappeared yet again. 　　\"Rémy is Lyonais,\" Teabing whispered, as if it were an unfortunate disease. \"But he does saucesquite nicely.\"Langdon looked amused. \"I would have thought you\u0027d import an English staff?\"\"Good heavens, no! I would not wish a British chef on anyone except the French tax collectors.\"He glanced over at Sophie. \"Pardonnez-moi, Mademoiselle Neveu. Please be assured that mydistaste for the French extends only to politics and the soccer pitch. Your government steals mymoney, and your football squad recently humiliated us.\"Sophie offered an easy smile. 　　Teabing eyed her a moment and then looked at Langdon. \"Something has happened. You both lookshaken.\"Langdon nodded. \"We\u0027ve had an interesting night, Leigh.\"\"No doubt. You arrive on my doorstep unannounced in the middle of the night speaking of theGrail. Tell me, is this indeed about the Grail, or did you simply say that because you know it is thelone topic for which I would rouse myself in the middle of the night?\"A little of both, Sophie thought, picturing the cryptex hidden beneath the couch. 　　\"Leigh,\" Langdon said, \"we\u0027d like to talk to you about the Priory of Sion.\"Teabing\u0027s bushy eyebrows arched with intrigue. \"The keepers. So this is indeed about the Grail. 　　You say you come with information? Something new, Robert?\"\"Perhaps. We\u0027re not quite sure. We might have a better idea if we could get some information fromyou first.\"Teabing wagged his finger. \"Ever the wily American. A game of quid pro quo. Very well. I am atyour service. What is it I can tell you?\"Langdon sighed. \"I was hoping you would be kind enough to explain to Ms. Neveu the true natureof the Holy Grail.\"Teabing looked stunned. \"She doesn\u0027t know?\"Langdon shook his head. 　　The smile that grew on Teabing\u0027s face was almost obscene. \"Robert, you\u0027ve brought me a virgin?\"Langdon winced, glancing at Sophie. \"Virgin is the term Grail enthusiasts use to describe anyonewho has never heard the true Grail story.\"Teabing turned eagerly to Sophie. \"How much do you know, my dear?\"Sophie quickly outlined what Langdon had explained earlier—the Priory of Sion, the KnightsTemplar, the Sangreal documents, and the Holy Grail, which many claimed was not a cup... butrather something far more powerful. 　　\"That\u0027s all?\" Teabing fired Langdon a scandalous look. \"Robert, I thought you were a gentleman. 　　You\u0027ve robbed her of the climax!\"\"I know, I thought perhaps you and I could...\" Langdon apparently decided the unseemly metaphorhad gone far enough. 　　Teabing already had Sophie locked in his twinkling gaze. \"You are a Grail virgin, my dear. Andtrust me, you will never forget your first time.\" 装甲车顺着那条两旁排列着白杨树的蜿蜒车道驶向别墅。索菲觉得浑身紧绷的肌肉放松了下来。能离开公路，她感到很欣慰。除了这个篱笆包围中的外国人的私家庄园，她再也想不出其他什么避难所了。 车转入了宽阔的弧形车道后，别墅就映人了他们的眼帘。那座房子有三层，六十英尺长，耀眼的聚光灯照耀着灰色的石块墙面。外观粗糙的楼房前面是优美洁净的花园和波光粼粼的池塘。 楼房里亮起了灯。 兰登没把车开到前门，而是把它停在了常春藤环绕的停车场上。他说道：\"没必要冒险被公路上的人发现，也没有必要让雷为我们开来一辆破破烂烂的装甲车而疑惑。\"索菲点点头：\"那我们怎么处置密码筒呢？我们不能把它留在这里，可是如果让雷看到了，他肯定想知道这是什么东西。\"\"不用担心。\"兰登说。他跳下车，脱下身上的夹克衫，把盒子裹了起来，然后像抱婴儿似的把那捆衣服小心翼翼地搂在怀中。 索菲不放心地看着他：\"小心一点。\" \"提彬从不亲自给客人开门，他喜欢让客人自己进去。等进去后，在他没来招呼我们之前，我会找个地方把它藏起来。\"兰登停了一下，接着说道：\"实际上，我得在你见他之前提醒你一下：许多人都觉得他的幽默有些……奇特。\"索菲暗想，还能有什么比今晚发生的事更奇特呢？ 弧形的鹅卵石小路通向一座刻有橡树和樱桃图案的门，门上的铜门环有葡萄那么大。 索菲正想去抓那个门环，门就打开了。 一个穿着整洁得体的男管家站在他们面前，整理着刚刚才穿戴上的白领带和晚礼服。 他看上去五十岁左右，举止优雅，可是表情严肃，显然对他们的到来不太欢迎。 \"雷先生马上就下来。\"他朗声说道，法语口音很重。\"他在更衣。他不喜欢穿着睡衣迎接客人。要我为您拿外套吗？\"他皱着眉头，看着兰登怀中的衣服，说道。 \"谢谢，我自己来。\" \"当然。请这边走。\" 管家领着他们穿过一个铺着大理石的豪华大厅，走进了一间装修精美的客厅，在那里垂着缨穗的维多利亚时代灯具投射着柔和的灯光。空气有些陈腐--烟草、茶叶、煮葡萄酒的味道和石质建筑发出的泥土气息混合在一起--但颇有帝王气息。在对面的墙上，有一个大得能烤牛的壁炉。男管家走到壁炉前，弯下腰，划了一根火柴，点燃了里面的橡木。不一会儿，木头就\"噼噼啪啪\"地燃烧了起来。 管家站起来，整了一下衣服，说道：\"先生希望你们随意。\"说完，他转身走了，只留下索菲和兰登独自在屋里。 索菲发现壁炉旁边有许多古董式的座位--一个文艺复兴时期的天鹅绒长沙发，一个乡村鹰爪形摇椅，还有一对好像是从拜占庭古庙里搬来的靠背长凳--一时竟不知应该坐在哪里。 兰登把木盒从外套里拿出来，塞到了天鹅绒长沙发里。从外面一点也看不到木盒的影子。然后，他抖了一下夹克衫，穿在了身上，整了整衣领，一屁股坐在那个藏着宝贝的沙发上面，笑盈盈地看着索菲。 就坐沙发吧，索菲想着，靠着兰登坐了下来。 索菲看着燃烧的火焰，感受着温暖，心想要是祖父在的话，肯定会喜欢这个房间。黑色的木板墙上装饰着早期绘画大师的作品。索菲认出其中一幅是祖父最喜欢的画家之一普桑的作品。壁炉架上放着一尊古埃及生育女神伊希斯的半身石膏像。 埃及女神像下面，有两个在壁炉里当柴架的石质\"怪兽滴水嘴\"，它们大张着嘴巴，露出了吓人的喉咙。小时候，索菲总是很害怕怪兽状的滴水嘴。有一次，在暴风雨大作的时候，祖父把她带到了巴黎圣母院的房顶上。他指着那些嘴里不断涌出雨水的怪兽状排水口，说道：\"我的小公主，看看这些蠢家伙，你听到它们嘴里发出的有趣声音了吗？\"索菲点点头，觉得它们好像在打嗝，不禁笑了起来。祖父说：\"它们在漱口呢。这就是把它们叫做\"怪兽滴水嘴\"的原因。\"从那以后，索菲再也没怕过\"怪兽滴水嘴\"了。 美好的回忆使索菲感到一阵悲伤，祖父被谋杀的现实又一次被摆到了她的面前。祖父死了。她想到了长沙发下的密码筒，想知道兰登能否打开它，想知道雷爵士究竟能否帮上忙。祖父去世前留下话，让她去找罗伯特。兰登，可没说要把其他人也牵扯进来。可是，我们需要藏身之处呀，索菲自言自语道，她决定相信罗伯特的判断。 \"罗伯特先生！\"他们身后传来一声咆哮。\"我看到你在跟一位少女一起旅行。\" 兰登站了起来。索菲也一跃而起。声音来自通向二楼阴暗处的螺旋形楼梯。楼梯上面，一个身影在阴影里移动着，只能看到他的轮廓。 兰登说道：\"晚上好。雷先生。请允许我给您介绍索菲。奈芙。\" 提彬边向灯光处走来，边说道：\"非常荣幸见到您。\" \"非常感谢您接待我们。\"索菲说道。现在她看清了那个男子腿上装着金属假肢，拄着拐杖。他一次只能下一级台阶。她又说道：\"我想现在来打搅您，实在是太晚了。\" \"是太早了，亲爱的。都是早上了。\"他大笑着说道。\"你是美国人吗？\" 索菲摇摇头说：\"巴黎人。\" \"你的英语很棒啊。\" \"谢谢。我是在英国皇家霍洛威大学念的书。\" \"啊！怪不得。\"提彬从阴影里蹒跚着走下来。\"也许罗伯特告诉过你，我是在贵校旁边的牛津上的学。\"提彬看着兰登，调皮地笑了起来。\"当然了。我也申请了哈佛大学。做候补学校。\" 提彬来到楼下。索菲认为他和埃尔顿。约翰爵士一样是典型的骑士。他身材魁伟，面色红润。长着一头浓密的红发，说话时一双淡褐色眼睛快活地眨动着。他穿着笔挺的裤子，宽大的真丝衬衫外套着一件佩斯利螺旋花纹呢背心。虽然他腿上绑着铝制假肢，但他看上去乐观开朗。腰杆笔直。言行举止问自然地流露出一种贵族气质。 提彬走过来，握住兰登的手说：\"罗伯特，你瘦了。\" 兰登笑着说：\"你胖了。\" 提彬拍着他那圆鼓鼓的肚子，开心地大笑了起来。\"讲得好！近来我的肉体快乐只有在厨房里才能得到满足。\"他转向索菲，温柔地拿起她的手，微微地低下头，在她手指上轻轻地吹了一下，然后看着她说：\"我的小姐。\" 索菲疑惑地看着兰登，不知道自己是应该及时地向后退一步呢，还是停在原地。 这时，男管家把茶点端了进来，放在了壁炉旁边的桌子上。 \"这是雷米。莱格鲁德。\"提彬说道。\"我的男佣。\" 那位瘦长的管家僵硬地点了一下头，走了出去。 \"雷米是里昂人。\"提彬轻声说道，好像提到了可怕的疾病。\"可是他擅长做汤。\" 兰登被逗笑了。\"我还以为你会从英国招一个佣人呢！\" \"天哪！决不！我只会让英国厨子去侍奉那些法国税务官。\"他抬头看着索菲说道：\"请原谅，奈芙小姐。请放心，我对法国的憎恨仅限于政治和足球。你们的政府偷走了我的钱，而你们的球队刚刚羞辱了我们。\"索菲轻声地笑了一下。 提彬瞪着眼看了她一会儿，然后看了看兰登，说道：\"肯定出了什么事。你们看上去都很惊慌。\"兰登点点头，说道：\"雷，我刚刚度过了一个有趣的夜晚。\" \"毫无疑问。你们招呼也不打，半夜三更跑到我家，要跟我谈论圣杯的事情，难道这还不够有趣吗？你们要说的事确实跟圣杯有关吗？还是你们知道只有跟圣杯有关的事才能让我半夜从床上爬起来，才这样说的？\" \"两个原因都有。\"索菲惦记着垫子下面的密码筒。 兰登说道：\"雷，我们想跟你谈谈关于隐修会的事。\" 提彬好奇地抬起浓密的眉毛，睁大了双眼。\"秘密保守人？那么，这确实跟圣杯有关了。你们说带来了一些消息。是新消息吗，罗伯特？\" \"也许是，我们不肯定。如果你能先告诉我们一些消息，我们会作出更好的判断。\" 提彬指着他，轻蔑地说：\"你可真是个老谋深算的美国人。那么，就让我们一物换一物。好吧，乐意为你们服务。你们想知道什么呢？\" 兰登叹了口气，说道：\"你能否好心地向奈芙小姐讲解一下圣杯的实质？\" 提彬目瞪口呆：\"她不知道？\" 兰登摇了摇头。 提彬笑了起来，脸上浮现出看似猥亵的表情。\"罗伯特，你给我带来了一个\"处女\"？\" 兰登挥了一下手，看着索菲说：\"\"处女\"是圣杯的狂热追随者对从未听过圣杯故事的人的称呼。\"提彬急切地转向索菲，问道：\"亲爱的，关于圣杯你知道多少呢？\" 索菲把兰登早些时候告诉她的一些东西简要地说了一下：从隐修会到圣殿武士团，从圣杯文件到圣杯拥有神奇力量的传说。 提彬震惊地看着兰登，不怀好意地说道：\"就这些？罗伯特，我还以为你是个绅士呢。 你根本就没有让她达到高潮！\"\"我知道，我想你和我或许可以用更……\"兰登显然觉得这个比喻太过火了。 提彬早已盯住了索菲，双眼冒光：\"亲爱的，你是个圣杯处女。请相信，你永远都忘不了你的第一次。\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8607.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
