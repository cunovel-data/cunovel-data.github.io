{"id":30245,"no":105,"title":"Chapter 104","content":"Rosslyn Chapel—often called the Cathedral of Codes—stands seven miles south of Edinburgh,Scotland, on the site of an ancient Mithraic temple. Built by the Knights Templar in 1446, thechapel is engraved with a mind-boggling array of symbols from the Jewish, Christian, Egyptian,Masonic, and pagan traditions.\n 　　The chapel\u0027s geographic coordinates fall precisely on the north-south meridian that runs throughGlastonbury. This longitudinal Rose Line is the traditional marker of King Arthur\u0027s Isle of Avalonand is considered the central pillar of Britain\u0027s sacred geometry. It is from this hallowed Rose Linethat Rosslyn—originally spelled Roslin—takes its name.\n 　　Rosslyn\u0027s rugged spires were casting long evening shadows as Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveupulled their rental car into the grassy parking area at the foot of the bluff on which the chapel stood.\n 　　Their short flight from London to Edinburgh had been restful, although neither of them had sleptfor the anticipation of what lay ahead. Gazing up at the stark edifice framed against a cloud-sweptsky, Langdon felt like Alice falling headlong into the rabbit hole. This must be a dream. And yet heknew the text of Saunière\u0027s final message could not have been more specific.\n 　　The Holy Grail \u0027neath ancient Roslin waits.\n 　　Langdon had fantasized that Saunière\u0027s \"Grail map\" would be a diagram—a drawing with an X-marks-the-spot—and yet the Priory\u0027s final secret had been unveiled in the same way Saunière hadspoken to them from the beginning. Simple verse. Four explicit lines that pointed without a doubtto this very spot. In addition to identifying Rosslyn by name, the verse made reference to several ofthe chapel\u0027s renowned architectural features.\n 　　Despite the clarity of Saunière\u0027s final revelation, Langdon had been left feeling more off balancethan enlightened. To him, Rosslyn Chapel seemed far too obvious a location. For centuries, thisstone chapel had echoed with whispers of the Holy Grail\u0027s presence. The whispers had turned toshouts in recent decades when ground-penetrating radar revealed the presence of an astonishingstructure beneath the chapel—a massive subterranean chamber. Not only did this deep vault dwarfthe chapel atop it, but it appeared to have no entrance or exit. Archaeologists petitioned to beginblasting through the bedrock to reach the mysterious chamber, but the Rosslyn Trust expresslyforbade any excavation of the sacred site. Of course, this only fueled the fires of speculation. Whatwas the Rosslyn Trust trying to hide?\n 　　Rosslyn had now become a pilgrimage site for mystery seekers. Some claimed they were drawnhere by the powerful magnetic field that emanated inexplicably from these coordinates, someclaimed they came to search the hillside for a hidden entrance to the vault, but most admitted theyhad come simply to wander the grounds and absorb the lore of the Holy Grail.\n 　　Although Langdon had never been to Rosslyn before now, he always chuckled when he heard thechapel described as the current home of the Holy Grail. Admittedly, Rosslyn once might have beenhome to the Grail, long ago... but certainly no longer. Far too much attention had been drawn toRosslyn in past decades, and sooner or later someone would find a way to break into the vault.\n 　　True Grail academics agreed that Rosslyn was a decoy—one of the devious dead ends the Priorycrafted so convincingly. Tonight, however, with the Priory\u0027s keystone offering a verse that pointeddirectly to this spot, Langdon no longer felt so smug. A perplexing question had been runningthrough his mind all day:\n 　　Why would Saunière go to such effort to guide us to so obvious a location?\n 　　There seemed only one logical answer.\n 　　There is something about Rosslyn we have yet to understand.\n 　　\"Robert?\" Sophie was standing outside the car, looking back at him. \"Are you corning?\" She washolding the rosewood box, which Captain Fache had returned to them. Inside, both cryptexes hadbeen reassembled and nested as they had been found. The papyrus verse was locked safely at itscore—minus the shattered vial of vinegar.\n 　　Making their way up the long gravel path, Langdon and Sophie passed the famous west wall of thechapel. Casual visitors assumed this oddly protruding wall was a section of the chapel that had notbeen finished. The truth, Langdon recalled, was far more intriguing.\n 　　The west wall of Solomon\u0027s Temple.\n 　　The Knights Templar had designed Rosslyn Chapel as an exact architectural blueprint ofSolomon\u0027s Temple in Jerusalem—complete with a west wall, a narrow rectangular sanctuary, and asubterranean vault like the Holy of Holies, in which the original nine knights had first unearthedtheir priceless treasure. Langdon had to admit, there existed an intriguing symmetry in the idea ofthe Templars building a modern Grail repository that echoed the Grail\u0027s original hiding place.\n 　　Rosslyn Chapel\u0027s entrance was more modest than Langdon expected. The small wooden door hadtwo iron hinges and a simple, oak sign.\n 　　ROSLINThis ancient spelling, Langdon explained to Sophie, derived from the Rose Line meridian on whichthe chapel sat; or, as Grail academics preferred to believe, from the \"Line of Rose\"—the ancestrallineage of Mary Magdalene.\n 　　The chapel would be closing soon, and as Langdon pulled open the door, a warm puff of airescaped, as if the ancient edifice were heaving a weary sigh at the end of a long day. Her entryarches burgeoned with carved cinquefoils.\n 　　Roses. The womb of the goddess.\n 　　Entering with Sophie, Langdon felt his eyes reaching across the famous sanctuary and taking it allin. Although he had read accounts of Rosslyn\u0027s arrestingly intricate stonework, seeing it in personwas an overwhelming encounter.\n 　　Symbology heaven, one of Langdon\u0027s colleagues had called it.\n 　　Every surface in the chapel had been carved with symbols—Christian cruciforms, Jewish stars,Masonic seals, Templar crosses, cornucopias, pyramids, astrological signs, plants, vegetables,pentacles, and roses. The Knights Templar had been master stonemasons, erecting Templarchurches all over Europe, but Rosslyn was considered their most sublime labor of love andveneration. The master masons had left no stone uncarved. Rosslyn Chapel was a shrine to allfaiths... to all traditions... and, above all, to nature and the goddess.\n 　　The sanctuary was empty except for a handful of visitors listening to a young man giving the day\u0027slast tour. He was leading them in a single-file line along a well-known route on the floor—aninvisible pathway linking six key architectural points within the sanctuary. Generations of visitorshad walked these straight lines, connecting the points, and their countless footsteps had engravedan enormous symbol on the floor.\n 　　Star of DavidThe Star of David, Langdon thought. No coincidence there. Also known as Solomon\u0027s Seal, thishexagram had once been the secret symbol of the stargazing priests and was later adopted by theIsraelite kings—David and Solomon.\n 　　The docent had seen Langdon and Sophie enter, and although it was closing time, offered apleasant smile and motioned for them to feel free to look around.\n 　　Langdon nodded his thanks and began to move deeper into the sanctuary. Sophie, however, stoodriveted in the entryway, a puzzled look on her face.\n 　　\"What is it?\" Langdon asked.\n 　　Sophie stared out at the chapel. \"I think... I\u0027ve been here.\"Langdon was surprised. \"But you said you hadn\u0027t even heard of Rosslyn.\"\"I hadn\u0027t...\" She scanned the sanctuary, looking uncertain. \"My grandfather must have brought mehere when I was very young. I don\u0027t know. It feels familiar.\" As her eyes scanned the room, shebegan nodding with more certainty. \"Yes.\" She pointed to the front of the sanctuary. \"Those twopillars... I\u0027ve seen them.\"Langdon looked at the pair of intricately sculpted columns at the far end of the sanctuary. Theirwhite lacework carvings seemed to smolder with a ruddy glow as the last of the day\u0027s sunlightstreamed in through the west window. The pillars—positioned where the altar would normallystand—were an oddly matched pair. The pillar on the left was carved with simple, vertical lines,while the pillar on the right was embellished with an ornate, flowering spiral.\n 　　Sophie was already moving toward them. Langdon hurried after her, and as they reached thepillars, Sophie was nodding with incredulity. \"Yes, I\u0027m positive I have seen these!\"\"I don\u0027t doubt you\u0027ve seen them,\" Langdon said, \"but it wasn\u0027t necessarily here.\"She turned. \"What do you mean?\"\"These two pillars are the most duplicated architectural structures in history. Replicas exist all overthe world.\"\"Replicas of Rosslyn?\" She looked skeptical.\n 　　\"No. Of the pillars. Do you remember earlier that I mentioned Rosslyn itself is a copy of Solomon\u0027sTemple? Those two pillars are exact replicas of the two pillars that stood at the head of Solomon\u0027sTemple.\" Langdon pointed to the pillar on the left. \"That\u0027s called Boaz—or the Mason\u0027s Pillar. Theother is called Jachin—or the Apprentice Pillar.\" He paused. \"In fact, virtually every Masonictemple in the world has two pillars like these.\"Langdon had already explained to her about the Templars\u0027 powerful historic ties to the modernMasonic secret societies, whose primary degrees—Apprentice Freemason, Fellowcraft Freemason,and Master Mason—harked back to early Templar days. Sophie\u0027s grandfather\u0027s final verse madedirect reference to the Master Masons who adorned Rosslyn with their carved artistic offerings. Italso noted Rosslyn\u0027s central ceiling, which was covered with carvings of stars and planets.\n 　　\"I\u0027ve never been in a Masonic temple,\" Sophie said, still eyeing the pillars. \"I am almost positive Isaw these here.\" She turned back into the chapel, as if looking for something else to jog hermemory.\n 　　The rest of the visitors were now leaving, and the young docent made his way across the chapel tothem with a pleasant smile. He was a handsome young man in his late twenties, with a Scottishbrogue and strawberry blond hair. \"I\u0027m about to close up for the day. May I help you findanything?\"How about the Holy Grail? Langdon wanted to say.\n 　　\"The code,\" Sophie blurted, in sudden revelation. \"There\u0027s a code here!\"The docent looked pleased by her enthusiasm. \"Yes there is, ma\u0027am.\"\"It\u0027s on the ceiling,\" she said, turning to the right-hand wall. \"Somewhere over... there.\"He smiled. \"Not your first visit to Rosslyn, I see.\"The code, Langdon thought. He had forgotten that little bit of lore. Among Rosslyn\u0027s numerousmysteries was a vaulted archway from which hundreds of stone blocks protruded, jutting down toform a bizarre multifaceted surface. Each block was carved with a symbol, seemingly at random,creating a cipher of unfathomable proportion. Some people believed the code revealed the entranceto the vault beneath the chapel.\n 　　Others believed it told the true Grail legend. Not that it mattered—cryptographers had been tryingfor centuries to decipher its meaning. To this day the Rosslyn Trust offered a generous reward toanyone who could unveil the secret meaning, but the code remained a mystery. \"I\u0027d be happy toshow...\"The docent\u0027s voice trailed off.\n 　　My first code, Sophie thought, moving alone, in a trance, toward the encoded archway. Havinghanded the rosewood box to Langdon, she could feel herself momentarily forgetting all about theHoly Grail, the Priory of Sion, and all the mysteries of the past day. When she arrived beneath theencoded ceiling and saw the symbols above her, the memories came flooding back. She wasrecalling her first visit here, and strangely, the memories conjured an unexpected sadness.\n 　　She was a little girl... a year or so after her family\u0027s death. Her grandfather had brought her toScotland on a short vacation. They had come to see Rosslyn Chapel before going back to Paris. Itwas late evening, and the chapel was closed. But they were still inside.\n 　　\"Can we go home, Grand-père?\" Sophie begged, feeling tired.\n 　　\"Soon, dear, very soon.\" His voice was melancholy. \"I have one last thing I need to do here. Howabout if you wait in the car?\"\"You\u0027re doing another big person thing?\"He nodded. \"I\u0027ll be fast. I promise.\"\"Can I do the archway code again? That was fun.\"\"I don\u0027t know. I have to step outside. You won\u0027t be frightened in here alone?\"\"Of course not!\" she said with a huff. \"It\u0027s not even dark yet!\"He smiled. \"Very well then.\" He led her over to the elaborate archway he had shown her earlier.\n 　　Sophie immediately plopped down on the stone floor, lying on her back and staring up at thecollage of puzzle pieces overhead. \"I\u0027m going to break this code before you get back!\"\"It\u0027s a race then.\" He bent over, kissed her forehead, and walked to the nearby side door. \"I\u0027ll beright outside. I\u0027ll leave the door open. If you need me, just call.\" He exited into the soft eveninglight.\n 　　Sophie lay there on the floor, gazing up at the code. Her eyes felt sleepy. After a few minutes, thesymbols got fuzzy. And then they disappeared.\n 　　When Sophie awoke, the floor felt cold.\n 　　\"Grand-père?\"There was no answer. Standing up, she brushed herself off. The side door was still open. Theevening was getting darker. She walked outside and could see her grandfather standing on theporch of a nearby stone house directly behind the church. Her grandfather was talking quietly to aperson barely visible inside the screened door.\n 　　\"Grand-père?\" she called.\n 　　Her grandfather turned and waved, motioning for her to wait just a moment. Then, slowly, he saidsome final words to the person inside and blew a kiss toward the screened door. He came to herwith tearful eyes.\n 　　\"Why are you crying, Grand-père?\"He picked her up and held her close. \"Oh, Sophie, you and I have said good-bye to a lot of peoplethis year. It\u0027s hard.\"Sophie thought of the accident, of saying good-bye to her mother and father, her grandmother andbaby brother. \"Were you saying goodbye to another person?\"\"To a dear friend whom I love very much,\" he replied, his voice heavy with emotion. \"And I fear Iwill not see her again for a very long time.\"Standing with the docent, Langdon had been scanning the chapel walls and feeling a risingwariness that a dead end might be looming. Sophie had wandered off to look at the code and leftLangdon holding the rosewood box, which contained a Grail map that now appeared to be no helpat all. Although Saunière\u0027s poem clearly indicated Rosslyn, Langdon was not sure what to do nowthat they had arrived. The poem made reference to a \"blade and chalice,\" which Langdon sawnowhere.\n 　　The Holy Grail \u0027neath ancient Roslin waits.\n 　　The blade and chalice guarding o\u0027er Her gates.\n 　　Again Langdon sensed there remained some facet of this mystery yet to reveal itself.\n 　　\"I hate to pry,\" the docent said, eyeing the rosewood box in Langdon\u0027s hands. \"But this box... mightI ask where you got it?\"Langdon gave a weary laugh. \"That\u0027s an exceptionally long story.\"The young man hesitated, his eyes on the box again. \"It\u0027s the strangest thing—my grandmother hasa box exactly like that—a jewelry box. Identical polished rosewood, same inlaid rose, even thehinges look the same.\"Langdon knew the young man must be mistaken. If ever a box had been one of a kind, it was thisone—the box custom-made for the Priory keystone. \"The two boxes may be similar but—\"The side door closed loudly, drawing both of their gazes. Sophie had exited without a word andwas now wandering down the bluff toward a fieldstone house nearby. Langdon stared after her.\n 　　Where is she going? She had been acting strangely ever since they entered the building. He turnedto the docent. \"Do you know what that house is?\"He nodded, also looking puzzled that Sophie was going down there. \"That\u0027s the chapel rectory. Thechapel curator lives there. She also happens to be the head of the Rosslyn Trust.\" He paused. \"Andmy grandmother.\"\"Your grandmother heads the Rosslyn Trust?\"The young man nodded. \"I live with her in the rectory and help keep up the chapel and give tours.\"He shrugged. \"I\u0027ve lived here my whole life. My grandmother raised me in that house.\"Concerned for Sophie, Langdon moved across the chapel toward the door to call out to her. He wasonly halfway there when he stopped short. Something the young man said just registered.\n 　　My grandmother raised me.\n 　　Langdon looked out at Sophie on the bluff, then down at the rosewood box in his hand. Impossible.\n 　　Slowly, Langdon turned back to the young man. \"You said your grandmother has a box like thisone?\"\"Almost identical.\"\"Where did she get it?\"\"My grandfather made it for her. He died when I was a baby, but my grandmother still talks abouthim. She says he was a genius with his hands. He made all kinds of things.\"Langdon glimpsed an unimaginable web of connections emerging. \"You said your grandmotherraised you. Do you mind my asking what happened to your parents?\"The young man looked surprised. \"They died when I was young.\" He paused. \"The same day as mygrandfather.\"Langdon\u0027s heart pounded. \"In a car accident?\"The docent recoiled, a look of bewilderment in his olive-green eyes. \"Yes. In a car accident. Myentire family died that day. I lost my grandfather, my parents, and...\" He hesitated, glancing downat the floor. \"And your sister,\" Langdon said.\n 　　Out on the bluff, the fieldstone house was exactly as Sophie remembered it. Night was falling now,and the house exuded a warm and inviting aura. The smell of bread wafted through the openedscreened door, and a golden light shone in the windows. As Sophie approached, she could hear thequiet sounds of sobbing from within.\n 　　Through the screened door, Sophie saw an elderly woman in the hallway. Her back was to thedoor, but Sophie could see she was crying. The woman had long, luxuriant, silver hair thatconjured an unexpected wisp of memory. Feeling herself drawn closer, Sophie stepped onto theporch stairs. The woman was clutching a framed photograph of a man and touching her fingertipsto his face with loving sadness.\n 　　It was a face Sophie knew well.\n 　　Grand-père.\n 　　The woman had obviously heard the sad news of his death last night.\n 　　A board squeaked beneath Sophie\u0027s feet, and the woman turned slowly, her sad eyes findingSophie\u0027s. Sophie wanted to run, but she stood transfixed. The woman\u0027s fervent gaze never waveredas she set down the photo and approached the screened door. An eternity seemed to pass as the twowomen stared at one another through the thin mesh. Then, like the slowly gathering swell of anocean wave, the woman\u0027s visage transformed from one of uncertainty... to disbelief... to hope... andfinally, to cresting joy.\n 　　Throwing open the door, she came out, reaching with soft hands, cradling Sophie\u0027s thunderstruckface. \"Oh, dear child... look at you!\"Although Sophie did not recognize her, she knew who this woman was. She tried to speak butfound she could not even breathe.\n 　　\"Sophie,\" the woman sobbed, kissing her forehead.\n 　　Sophie\u0027s words were a choked whisper. \"But... Grand-père said you were...\"\"I know.\" The woman placed her tender hands on Sophie\u0027s shoulders and gazed at her with familiareyes. \"Your grandfather and I were forced to say so many things. We did what we thought wasright. I\u0027m so sorry. It was for your own safety, princess.\"Sophie heard her final word, and immediately thought of her grandfather, who had called herprincess for so many years. The sound of his voice seemed to echo now in the ancient stones ofRosslyn, settling through the earth and reverberating in the unknown hollows below.\n 　　The woman threw her arms around Sophie, the tears flowing faster. \"Your grandfather wanted sobadly to tell you everything. But things were difficult between you two. He tried so hard. There\u0027sso much to explain. So very much to explain.\" She kissed Sophie\u0027s forehead once again, thenwhispered in her ear. \"No more secrets, princess. It\u0027s time you learn the truth about our family.\"Sophie and her grandmother were seated on the porch stairs in a tearful hug when the young docentdashed across the lawn, his eyes shining with hope and disbelief.\n 　　\"Sophie?\"Through her tears, Sophie nodded, standing. She did not know the young man\u0027s face, but as theyembraced, she could feel the power of the blood coursing through his veins... the blood she nowunderstood they shared.\n 　　When Langdon walked across the lawn to join them, Sophie could not imagine that only yesterdayshe had felt so alone in the world. And now, somehow, in this foreign place, in the company ofthree people she barely knew, she felt at last that she was home.\n 罗斯林教堂，又被称作\"密码大教堂\"，它坐落在苏格兰爱丁堡市以南的七英里处，其旧址是一座崇拜密特拉神的神庙。该教堂是圣殿骑士于1446 年建造的，教堂各处，雕刻了令人叹为观止的、有着犹太教、基督教、埃及人、同济会以及异教传统的标志物。\n 教堂正处在南北交叉子午线经过格拉斯顿伯里的位置。这条纵向的\"玫瑰线\"，是传说中亚瑟王死后移葬的阿瓦隆岛的传统性标志，它被认为是英国这块神圣领域的中流砥柱。\n 罗斯林（Rosslyn），最早的拼法是Roslin，就是从这条被神化的\"玫瑰线\"得来的。\n 罗伯特。兰登与索菲。奈芙开着租来的轿车，驶入悬崖绝壁下面杂草丛生的停车区域。\n 罗斯林教堂就屹立在悬崖绝壁上。它那饱经风雨的塔尖，正投下悠长的背影。在从伦敦飞往爱丁堡的短暂旅程中，他们恢复了精力，尽管俩人谁也没有睡个好觉，因为他们对即将发生的事情充满了期待。兰登抬头凝望着那座荒凉的建筑物，它高高耸立在没有一丝云彩的天空。兰登觉得自己就像梦游仙境的爱丽丝，一头栽进了兔子洞。这一定是梦吧！然而他知道，索尼埃所给的最后提示是再具体不过了。\n 圣杯在古老的罗斯林教堂下面等待。\n 兰登本以为索尼埃的\"圣杯地图\"会是一张绘图，是一张用各种各样符号标明位置的地图，然而揭开郇山隐修会最终秘密的方式，竟然跟索尼埃开始说的是一样的。都是些简单的诗句。四行含义清楚的诗句，毫无疑问就是指这个地方。除了通过提到的名字可以确定是罗斯林教堂之外，诗里还提到这座教堂若干有名的建筑特征。\n 尽管索尼埃在他的最终暗示里已经说得很清楚。然而兰登心里还是七上八下，全然没有茅塞顿开之感。对他而言，罗斯林教堂似乎是太引人注目的地方了。几百年来，在这座石头砌就的教堂里，就一直回荡着人们私下议论圣杯就在此地的声音。最近几十年，由于人们利用探测地下的雷达技术，在教堂底下发现子一座大得惊人的地下宫殿，使得这样的低声议论逐渐汇集成震耳欲聋的一片呐喊。这个离地面极深的地下宫殿，不仅使建在其上的教堂相形见绌，而且似乎找不到什么进出口。考古学家们纷纷要求在它下层的基岩炸开一个洞，以便能进到里面去，然而罗斯林监管会明文禁止在这块神圣的土地上进行任何挖掘文物的活动。这当然只会引起人们更多无端的猜测。罗斯林监管会究竟想隐瞒什么呢？\n 罗斯林教堂现已成为喜欢冒险的猎奇者们朝圣的圣地。有人声称，他们是被它独特的地理位置产生的让人说不清道不明的强大磁场吸引到这里来的；有人则声称他们是为到山坡上寻找地下宫殿的人口而来的；但大多数人承认，他们到此地来转悠，不过是想来听听有关圣杯的故事，增长点见识罢了。\n 虽然此前兰登从未来过罗斯林教堂，但每当听人说起眼下圣杯就藏在这里时，他总是付之一笑。老实说，它或许曾经是圣杯的栖身之所，但这早已是多年前的事了；然而现在，它肯定不在那里了。在过去的几十年里，人们将过多的注意力集中在罗斯林教堂上，迟早有一天，人们会想方设法闯入这座地下宫殿的。\n 研究圣杯史的正统学院派，同意罗斯林教堂只是一个掩人耳目的陷阱的观点，认为它是郇山隐修会精心设计、颇具说服力而又迂回曲折的死胡同。不过今晚，由于郇山隐修会在诗中清楚指明圣杯就藏在这个地方，兰登便不再自以为是了。然而有个问题仍令他百思不得其解，并在他脑海里盘桓了一整天。\n 为什么索尼埃要如此煞费苦心将我们带到这么一个引人注目的地方来呢？\n 答案似乎只有一个。\n 罗斯林教堂的某些情况我们还没有充分了解。\n \"罗伯特？\"索菲站在车外，回头对他说。\"你来了没？\"她手拿紫檀木盒子，这是法希上尉还给他们的。里面两个密码盒被重新放在一起，就跟当初找到它们时一样。那张写有诗文的莎草纸被稳妥地锁在里面--只是盒里被打碎的玻璃醋瓶子已不见了。\n 兰登和索菲沿着长长的砾石路向山上走去，他们经过教堂有名的西墙。漫不经心的游客们也许会武断地认为，这堵模样古怪、向外突出的墙壁是这座尚未竣工的教堂的一部分。兰登想，真相本身远比这种主观臆断要有趣得多。\n 所罗门神庙式的西墙。\n 圣殿骑士们当初建造罗斯林教堂时，就是完全按照位于耶路撒冷的所罗门神庙的建筑风格设计的--在它竣工之初，就有一堵西墙，一个狭长的长方形礼拜堂，还有一座与至圣所相似的地下宫殿，在这座宫殿里，最初的九位骑士首先发现了无价之宝。兰登不得不承认。这些骑士，当初在为圣杯建造与它最早藏身之所遥相呼应的储藏所时，头脑里就已存在了某些有趣的几何概念。\n 罗斯林教堂的人口，比兰登原先估计的要质朴得多。小小的木门上，挂着两条铰链和一个粗糙的橡木标志，上面写着：罗斯林（ROSLIN）\n 兰登向索菲解释说，这种古代拼法，是从这座教堂建于其上的\"玫瑰\"子午线演化而来的；或者如研究圣杯史的学院派宁愿相信的观点所言，是由\"圣母族谱\"----即抹大拉的玛利亚一脉相承的家族谱系演变而来的。\n 教堂马上要关门了。然而兰登推开门，一股热气迎面飘来，仿佛是这座古老建筑，在漫长的白天行将结束时，发出的一声疲惫的叹息。教堂的拱形门上，满眼都是梅花形的雕饰。\n 它们是玫瑰，是女神怀孕子宫的标志。\n 兰登与索菲走进去，望向那间赫赫有名的礼拜堂的尽头，将它尽收眼底。尽管他读过许多关于罗斯林教堂里引人人胜却又错综复杂的石雕的文章，但亲眼所见的感觉，毕竟有很大的不同。\n 这是象征学研究的天堂，兰登的一位同事曾做过如是的评价。\n 教堂各处都雕刻了各种各样的象征物，其中有基督教的十字、犹太人的星状物、同济会的印章、圣殿骑士的十字架、哺乳过宙斯的羊、金字塔、星象符号、各种植物、蔬菜瓜果、五角星形以及玫瑰等等。圣殿骑士们以前都是技术娴熟的石匠出身，他们在欧洲各地建造圣殿教堂，然而唯有罗斯林教堂被认为是他们赢得人们热爱与崇敬的顶峰之作。这些能工巧匠精雕细刻，不放过任何一块石头。罗斯林教堂是所有宗教信仰的供奉所，是沿循所有传统的供奉所，尤其是大自然与女神的供奉所。\n 礼拜堂里空荡荡的，只有几位游客，在聆听一位领着他们作当天最后一游的年轻人给他们讲解。他带着他们排成一行，沿着地上一条非常有名的路线行走--那是条将礼拜堂内六个主要建筑区域连在一块的无形的小道。一代又一代的游客，从这些将六个建筑区域连起来的直线上走过，而他们留下的数不清的足迹，在地面上形成一个巨大的六角星形。\n △▽▽△△▽这是大卫之星，兰登心想。这里面绝不是什么巧合。这个六角星形，又被称作所罗门之印，它曾经是耽于幻想的牧师们秘密的象征物，只是后来又被以色列的国王--大卫与所罗门相继采用过。\n 虽然已到关门时刻，但那位年轻的导游，看到兰登与索菲进来，还是露出了令人愉悦的微笑，并示意他们可以随便到各处去转转。\n 兰登点头表示感谢，然后向礼拜堂的里头走去。然而索菲站在门口，仿佛被钉住了，她的脸上，写满了迷惑。\n \"你怎么啦？\"兰登关切地问。\n 索菲打量着教堂外面：\"我想……我曾经到过这里。\"\n 兰登有点惊奇：\"可你不是说，罗斯林教堂你甚至连听都没听过？！\"\n \"我是说过的……\"她扫视了礼拜堂一眼，似乎有点不敢肯定。\"我祖父在我小的时候，肯定带我来过这里。我不知道事实是不是这样。但我觉得它真的非常眼熟。\"她将大厅巡视了一遍，然后开始更加肯定地点头说：\"是的。\"她指了指礼拜堂的前面，说：\"那两根柱子……我见过。\"兰登望着礼拜堂远处两根经过精雕细刻的柱子。它们上面的白色花纹，仿佛被西边窗户里投射进来的最后一束阳光燃烧起来了，散发出通红的光芒。那两根柱子，建造在通常应该是圣坛所处的位置，因此总体上显得极不和谐。左面的柱子上，雕刻了一些简单垂直的线条，而右边的柱子上，泽装饰了华丽的螺旋型花纹。\n 此时索菲已经朝那两根柱子走去，兰登急忙跟在后面。当他们来到柱子前，索菲半信半疑地点点头。\"是的，我敢肯定我见过这些柱子。\"\n \"我并不怀疑你见过它们。\"兰登说：\"但你不一定是在这里看到的啊。\"\n 索菲转过身：\"你这是什么意思？\"\n \"这两根柱子，是历史上被仿制最多的建筑物。它们的仿制品满世界都能找到。\"\n \"你是说仿造罗斯林教堂？\"索菲满腹狐疑。\n \"不是，我是指这两根柱子。你还记得刚才我跟你说的，罗斯林教堂是仿造所罗门神庙的话吗？这两根柱子，就是所罗门神庙前两根柱子的翻版。\"兰登指了指左边的柱子，说：\"那根柱子被称作波阿斯--又叫石匠之柱，另外一根柱子，被称作亚钦--或称作学徒之柱。\"他稍停片刻，又说：\"实际上，世界各地所有由同济会建造的庙宇都有两根这样的柱子。\"兰登曾给她解释过，圣殿骑士们与现代同济会的秘密组织之间，存在着某种密不可分的历史联系。这些秘密组织几个最基本的等级--石工学徒、石工能手，以及石工大师--都会令人想起早期圣殿骑士的石工生涯。索菲的祖父在最后一首诗里，就直接提到以高超的雕刻技巧装扮了罗斯林教堂的石匠大师们。他在诗里还提到罗斯林教堂的中心顶篷，雕刻了各种各样的星球。\n \"我从未去过同济会建造的神庙。\"索菲说着，眼睛却仍盯着柱子。\"我几乎可以肯定，我是在这里见到这些柱子的。\"她回头又朝教堂里面张望，仿佛想寻找什么能唤起她记忆的东西。\n 其他的参观者现在都要走了，年轻的导游一脸灿烂的微笑，从教堂对面向他们走来。\n 他是个相貌英俊，大约二十八九岁年纪的年轻人，操-口苏格兰口音，长着一头红褐色的头发。\"教堂马上要关门了。需要我帮什么忙吗？\"\n 那你帮我们寻找圣杯，你看怎么样？兰登很想跟他这样说。\n \"密码。\"索菲脱口而出，突然发现什么了：\"这里有个密码。\"\n 导游似乎被她的热情劲儿逗乐了：\"是密码呀，女士。\"\n \"它在天花板上。\"她转身面对右边的墙，说：\"在那边的……某个地方呢。\"\n 导游笑了：\"我看得出来，你不是第一次到这里来的吧。\"\n 是这个密码啊，兰登心想。他已把这方面的知识忘得差不多了。罗斯林教堂拥有众多神秘的东西，其中有座拱顶门，数百块石头向外凸出来，一直向下延伸，形成一个奇异的多面体。每一块石头上都雕刻了标志物，表面上看来似乎漫不经心，然而由这些标志物设置的密码却深不可测。有人相信，这个密码将为人们开启通往教堂下面的地下宫殿的大门；其他人则相信，它向人们讲述了一个真实的圣杯故事。那倒是没什么关系--几个世纪以来，密码专家们就一直在努力寻找它的含义，而且直到今天，罗斯林监管会还许诺给任何能够解释其内在含义的人以丰厚的奖赏，但这个密码，至今仍然是一个谜。\n \"我很乐意带你们到各处去转转--\"\n 导游的声音逐渐变弱了。\n 那是我平生接触的第一个密码，索菲心想。她恍恍惚惚独自朝藏着密码的拱门走去。\n 她把紫檀木盒子递给兰登，很快就把圣杯、郇山隐修会，以及过去诸多难解之谜什么的统统抛在了脑后。她来到那块镶嵌着密码的天花板下面，注视着头上各种各样的符号，记忆如潮水一般涌上心来。她在回忆第一次到这里来的情景。不过奇怪的是，这些记忆却意外地令她伤心。\n 那时她还小--大约就是在她家人死后的一两年，祖父带着她到苏格兰去短期度假。\n 在回巴黎之前，他们去了罗斯林教堂。当时天色已晚，教堂都已关门。但他们还是进去了。\n \"祖父，我们回家去好吗？\"索菲觉得累了，于是她请求道。\n \"快了，宝贝，快了。\"他的声音听起来很忧郁。\"我还有件事要在这里办完，你在车里等我怎样？\"\n \"你又要去做大人的事情吗？\"\n 他点了点头，说：\"我答应你，我很快就回来的。\"\n \"那我可不可以再去猜一猜拱门上的密码呢？很好玩哩。\"\n \"我不知道，我要到外面去。你一个人在这里不害怕吧？\"\n \"当然不啦！\"她很不高兴地说：\"天还没有黑呢！\"\n 他微笑着说：\"那好。\"他领着她来到先前带她看过的精雕细刻的拱门前。\n 索菲立刻\"扑通\"一声扑倒在石地板上，仰面朝天地躺着，瞪着眼睛注视头上由各种谜组成的图案。\"我要在你回来前找到这个密码。\"\n \"那咱们来比赛吧。\"他弯下腰，吻了她的前额，然后朝附近的侧门走去。\"我就在外面，我把门开着，有事就叫我。\"随即，他走进了柔和的夜色里。\n 索菲躺在地上，抬头凝视着密码。很快，睡意上来了。过了一段时间，头上的符号逐渐变得模糊，然后消失了。\n 索菲醒过来时，觉得地面很是冰凉。\n \"祖父！\"\n 然而没有回音。她站起来，拂去身上的灰尘。侧门仍然开着。夜色更暗了。她走出去，看到祖父正站在附近一栋房子的走廊上。这栋房子就在教堂的后面。她祖父正跟一个站在纱门里几乎看不清楚的人悄悄地说话。\n \"祖父！\"她叫起来。\n 祖父转过身，向她挥了挥手，示意她再等一会。然后。他跟站在门里的人缓缓地说完最后几句话，并朝纱门给了一个飞吻。这才眼泪汪汪地走了过来。\n \"祖父，你怎么哭了？\"\n 他把她举起来，紧紧抱住子她。\"哦，索菲，今年，我和你要跟这么多人告别。我很难受啊。\"索菲想到了那次车祸，想到了跟她爸爸妈妈、奶奶还有尚在襁褓中的弟弟告别的情景。\"你是说又要跟另外一个人告别是吗？\"\n \"是跟我一位挚爱的朋友。\"他充满感情地回答说：\"我恐怕要很长时间见不到她了。\"\n 兰登站在导游身边，眼睛一直在教堂的墙上扫视着，他越来越担心又走进了一个死胡同。索菲已走开去，留下兰登端着紫檀木盒子，里面的地图，现在看来是没啥用处了。虽然索尼埃的诗里明显提到了罗斯林教堂，并且他们也已经来到了这里，兰登还是不知道怎么办才好。诗里提到的\"剑刃和圣杯\"，兰登却没在哪里看到。\n \"圣杯在古老的罗斯林教堂下面等待。\n 剑刃和圣杯一道看护着她的门外。\"兰登再次感到，这个谜的某些庐山真面目尚待他们去揭开。\n \"我并不喜欢打探别人的事情，\"导游看着兰登手中的紫檀木盒子，说：\"但这个盒子……我可以问问是从哪里弄来的吗？\"\n 兰登疲倦地笑了：\"这个嘛，说来可就话长了。\"\n 年轻人犹豫了一下，他的眼睛又盯着盒子看。\"这就怪了。我奶奶有个珠宝盒跟你的一模一样。同样光亮的紫檀木，镶嵌着同样的玫瑰，甚至连铰链都是一样。\"兰登心想，这位年轻人想必是弄错了。如果有什么盒子是这种款式的话，那就是这个盒子了--这可是为了放置郇山隐修会的拱心石而特意定做的盒子。\"两个盒子也许相似，可是--\"突然，侧门重重地被关上了，他们两人不由自主地望过去。索菲一言不发，走了。她正沿着悬崖峭壁，朝附近的一幢大卵石砌就的房子走去。兰登的目光追随着她。她要到哪里去呢？自他们进得教堂来，她的行为就一直很古怪。他转向年轻的导游，说：\"你知道那房子是做什么用的吗？\"\n 导游点点头，看着索菲朝那边走去，心里很是疑惑。\"那是教堂主持的住宅。教堂的主持就住在那里。她恰好也是罗斯林监管会的会长。\"他停下来又说：\"也是我的奶奶。\"\"你奶奶是罗斯林监管会的会长？\"\n 年轻人点了点头。\"我跟她--起住在那栋房子里，帮她管理教堂，顺便给游客们做导游。\"他耸耸肩，又说：\"我在这里住了大半辈子，我是奶奶一手养大的。\"兰登心里惦记着索菲，他穿过教堂，向门边走去，想把她叫住。他走到半路上，猛地停住。年轻人刚才说的话提醒了他。\n 我是奶奶一手养大的。\n 兰登望着走在外面悬崖上的索菲，然后低头看着手里的紫檀木盒子。这是不可能的！\n 慢慢地，兰登转身面对着那位年轻人，问道：\"你刚才说，你奶奶也有一个同样的盒子？\"\n \"差不多吧。\"\n \"她是从哪里弄来的？\"\n \"是我祖父给她做的。他死的时候，我还很小，可我奶奶至今仍经常谈到他，说他有双天才般的巧手。他经常给她做各种各样的东西。\"兰登仿佛看到一张各种关系盘根错节的大网在眼前出现了。\"你说你是奶奶抚养长大的。那你介不介意告诉我，你父母怎么啦？\"\n 年轻人看来很惊讶。\"我很小的时候他们就走了。\"他停了停又补充说：\"是与我祖父同一天去世的。\"兰登的心怦怦地跳了起来：\"是死于车祸吗？\"\n 年轻的导游退缩了一下，他那橄榄色的眼睛闪过一丝茫然：\"是的，他们是死于车祸。\n 我全家人都死于那一天，我祖父、父母，还有--\"他迟疑了片刻，低着头望着脚下的地面。\n \"还有你姐姐。\"兰登接口说。\n 在外面的悬崖上，那幢大卵石房子跟索菲记忆中的毫无二致。深夜正在降临，而烤熟的面包，正从那栋房子里散发出一股温暖而又诱人的香气，正透过那开着的纱门，弥漫在无尽的夜色里。一盏金黄的灯，将窗户都照亮了。索菲走近那幢房子，这时，她听到里面传出低低的饮泣声。\n 透过纱门，她看到走廊里坐着一位上了年纪的女人。她背对着门，但索菲还是看到她哭了。那女人长着一头长而茂密的银发，这使她猛然想起了什么。索菲觉得自己受了什么力量的牵引，因而走得越发近了，她跨上了走廊台阶。女人将一张镶人镜框的男人相片紧紧抓在手上，不时用手指充满爱怜地触碰着他的脸，神情十分悲伤。\n 这是一张索菲十分熟悉的脸。\n 是祖父。\n 这女人，显然已听说他昨晚被谋杀的噩耗了。\n 索菲脚下的木地板\"吱吱呀呀\"地响起来，那女人这才慢慢转过身。她悲伤的眼神，终于注意到了索菲。索菲想跑开，但脚下似乎被什么东西钉住了，终究没有动。女人放下照片，朝纱门走来，她炽烈的眼神一刻也没移开。当两个女人隔着薄薄的纱门网眼盯着对方互相看时，那一刻似乎定格成了永远。接着，那女人的表情犹如蓄势待发冲向浪尖的海浪，她先是半信半疑……然后又难以置信……接着又充满希望……最后又惊喜异常。\n 她一把推开门，走了出来，伸出柔软的双手，抱住索菲被惊呆了的脸。\"哦，宝贝，你看你！\"索菲虽然没有立刻认出她，但却知道这女人是谁。她竭力想说什么，却发现自己快要停止了呼吸。\n \"索菲。\"女人吻着她的前额，抽泣起来。\n 索菲轻声地说，似乎被噎住了：\"可是……祖父说你是……\"\n \"我知道。\"女人慈爱地将手搭在索菲的肩膀上，用那种熟悉的眼神把她打量。\"你祖父和我被迫说了很多事。我们做了我们以为是正确的事情。我很抱歉。可那是为你的安全着想，我的小公主。\"索菲听到最后一句话，马上想起了祖父，多少年来，他一直把她称作公主。此刻，他熟悉的声音似乎又在罗斯林教堂这座古老的石头房子里回荡，并侵入地下，在无名的空穴里产生回响。\n 女人张开双臂抱住索菲，眼泪流得更快了。\"你祖父好想把一切都告诉你。可你们两人的积怨太深。他努力想缓和你们之间的关系。要跟你解释的东西实在是太多，太多了。\"她再次吻了吻索菲的前额，然后在她耳边轻声地说：\"公主，再没有什么秘密了。现在，是该让你知道我们家中情况的时候了。\"索菲和她的奶奶，就这样你抱着我，我抱着你，泪流满面地坐在走廊的台阶上。这时，那位年轻的导游从草坪对面急奔过来，眼睛里闪烁着希望，还有怀疑的光芒。\n \"你是索菲？\"\n 索菲透过泪光，点点头，随即站起来。她并不认识这位年轻人，但在他们拥抱时，她分明感到血液在他血管里汹涌地扩张……她终于明白，一样的血液，在他们两个人的身上流淌。\n 当兰登走过草坪来到他们身边时，索菲无法想象，就在昨天晚上，她还觉得自己是那么孤单，然而现在，在这个陌生的地方，竟然有三个几乎说不上很熟悉的人相伴，她感到自己终于回到了故乡。\n \n
