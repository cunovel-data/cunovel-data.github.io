{"id":30193,"no":53,"title":"Chapter 52","content":"The Sprawling 185-acre estate of Chateau Villette was located twenty-five minutes northwest ofParis in the environs of Versailles. Designed by Fran.ois Mansart in 1668 for the Count of Aufflay,it was one of Paris\u0027s most significant historical chateaux. Complete with two rectangular lakes andgardens designed by Le N.tre, Chateau Villette was more of a modest castle than a mansion. Theestate fondly had become known as la Petite Versailles. 　　Langdon brought the armored truck to a shuddering stop at the foot of the mile-long driveway. 　　Beyond the imposing security gate, Sir Leigh Teabing\u0027s residence rose on a meadow in thedistance. The sign on the gate was in English: PRIVATE PROPERTY. NO TRESPASSING. 　　As if to proclaim his home a British Isle unto itself, Teabing had not only posted his signs inEnglish, but he had installed his gate\u0027s intercom entry system on the right-hand side of thetruck—the passenger\u0027s side everywhere in Europe except England. 　　Sophie gave the misplaced intercom an odd look. \"And if someone arrives without a passenger?\"\"Don\u0027t ask.\" Langdon had already been through that with Teabing. \"He prefers things the way theyare at home.\"Sophie rolled down her window. \"Robert, you\u0027d better do the talking.\"Langdon shifted his position, leaning out across Sophie to press the intercom button. As he did, analluring whiff of Sophie\u0027s perfume filled his nostrils, and he realized how close they were. Hewaited there, awkwardly prone, while a telephone began ringing over the small speaker. 　　Finally, the intercom crackled and an irritated French accent spoke. \"Chateau Villette. Who iscalling?\"\"This is Robert Langdon,\" Langdon called out, sprawled across Sophie\u0027s lap. \"I\u0027m a friend of SirLeigh Teabing. I need his help.\"\"My master is sleeping. As was I. What is your business with him?\"\"It is a private matter. One of great interest to him.\"\"Then I\u0027m sure he will be pleased to receive you in the morning.\"Langdon shifted his weight. \"It\u0027s quite important.\"\"As is Sir Leigh\u0027s sleep. If you are a friend, then you are aware he is in poor health.\"Sir Leigh Teabing had suffered from polio as a child and now wore leg braces and walked withcrutches, but Langdon had found him such a lively and colorful man on his last visit that it hardlyseemed an infirmity. \"If you would, please tell him I have uncovered new information about theGrail. Information that cannot wait until morning.\"There was a long pause. 　　Langdon and Sophie waited, the truck idling loudly. 　　A full minute passed. 　　Finally, someone spoke. \"My good man, I daresay you are still on Harvard Standard Time.\" Thevoice was crisp and light. 　　Langdon grinned, recognizing the thick British accent. \"Leigh, my apologies for waking you at thisobscene hour.\"\"My manservant tells me that not only are you in Paris, but you speak of the Grail.\"\"I thought that might get you out of bed.\"\"And so it has.\"\"Any chance you\u0027d open the gate for an old friend?\"\"Those who seek the truth are more than friends. They are brothers.\"Langdon rolled his eyes at Sophie, well accustomed to Teabing\u0027s predilection for dramatic antics. 　　\"Indeed I will open the gate,\" Teabing proclaimed, \"but first I must confirm your heart is true. Atest of your honor. You will answer three questions.\"Langdon groaned, whispering at Sophie. \"Bear with me here. As I mentioned, he\u0027s something of acharacter.\"\"Your first question,\" Teabing declared, his tone Herculean. \"Shall I serve you coffee, or tea?\"Langdon knew Teabing\u0027s feelings about the American phenomenon of coffee. \"Tea,\" he replied. 　　\"Earl Grey.\"\"Excellent. Your second question. Milk or sugar?\"Langdon hesitated. 　　\"Milk,\" Sophie whispered in his ear. \"I think the British take milk.\"\"Milk,\" Langdon said. 　　Silence. 　　\"Sugar?\"Teabing made no reply. 　　Wait! Langdon now recalled the bitter beverage he had been served on his last visit and realizedthis question was a trick. \"Lemon!\" he declared. \"Earl Grey with lemon\"\"Indeed.\" Teabing sounded deeply amused now. \"And finally, I must make the most grave ofinquiries.\" Teabing paused and then spoke in a solemn tone. \"In which year did a Harvard scullerlast outrow an Oxford man at Henley?\"Langdon had no idea, but he could imagine only one reason the question had been asked. \"Surelysuch a travesty has never occurred.\"The gate clicked open. \"Your heart is true, my friend. You may pass.\" 维莱特庄园位于凡尔赛近郊，占地185 公顷，从巴黎驱车25 分钟就可以到达。它最早是由弗兰西斯。曼萨特于1668 年为奥弗提伯爵设计的，是巴黎附近的历史名址之一。维莱特庄园里有两个四边形的湖泊和众多的花园，这些都是勒。瑙特设计的。与其说这座庄园看上去像座大厦，倒不如说它像个现代化的城堡。 兰登把车停在长达一英里的车道前。透过那扇气派的防盗大门，可以看到远处草坪边上雷。提彬爵士居住的那座城堡。门上的告示牌用英语写着：\"私人领地，非请勿入。\" 为了表明这是英国人的领地，提彬不仅在告示牌上写上英语，还把对讲电话安装在了车辆的右侧。除了英国，在整个欧洲那可是乘客坐的方位。 索菲诧异地看了看对讲电话，问道：\"要是有人没带乘客怎么办？\" \"别管这么多了。\"兰登很熟悉提彬那套我行我素的做法。\"他喜欢按英国的规矩行事。\" 索菲摇下车窗：\"罗伯特，最好由你来叫门。\" 兰登从索菲的身前倾过身子，去按对讲电话的按钮。这时，他闻到了索菲身上诱人的香水味，突然意识到他们俩已紧紧地靠在了一起。他尴尬地等在那儿，听对讲机不停地振铃。 最后，对讲机里终于传来\"咔嗒\"一声，接着传出带法国口音的声音：\"这里是维莱特庄园。是谁在按铃？\" \"我是罗伯特。兰登。\"兰登俯在索菲的膝盖上，答道：\"我是雷。提彬爵士的朋友。我需要他的帮助。\"\"主人正在睡觉。我也是。你找他有什么事？\" \"有点私事。他会非常感兴趣的。\" \"那么，我敢肯定他会非常愉快地在早上会见您。\" 兰登变换了一个姿势，坚持道：\"这件事非常重要，我需要马上见他。\" \"可是雷爵士正在睡觉。如果您是他朋友，您应该知道他身体不好，经不起折腾。\" 雷。提彬爵士小时候得过脑灰质炎，现在腿上还绑着矫形器，走路得用拐杖。可是兰登上次见他时，发现他是那么活泼风趣，一点也不像有病的样子。\"如果可以，请告诉他我找到了有关圣杯的新线索。非常紧急，不能等到早上。\"接下来就是一片沉寂。 兰登和索菲等在那里，耳边只有装甲车发动机的隆隆响声。 足足过了一分钟。 终于对讲机那头传来了清脆而温和说话声。\"好家伙，我敢说你现在还在按照美国哈佛大学的标准时间来行事呢。\"兰登听出话里浓重的英国口音，笑了起来。\"雷，非常抱歉在这个不合适的时间把你吵醒。\"\"我的男佣告诉我你不仅来到了巴黎，而且还带来了圣杯的消息。\" \"我想那样会把你从床上喊起来。\" \"不错。\" \"能为老朋友开开门吗？\" \"寻求真理的人不仅仅是朋友，而且是兄弟。\" 兰登看了看索菲。提彬喜欢用戏剧里的古怪台词，这一点他早就习惯了。 \"我会打开大门的。\"提彬宣称道。\"但是首先我得确认你的心是否真诚。为了测试一下你的道义，你得回答三个问题。\"兰登叹了一口气，在索菲的耳边低声说道：\"请忍耐一会儿。我跟你说过，他是个有个性的人。\" 这时，提彬大声说道：\"第一个问题。你是要喝茶还是咖啡？\" 兰登知道提彬讨厌美国人喝咖啡的习惯，于是说道：\"茶，而且是伯爵红茶。\" \"很好。第二个问题。要加牛奶还是糖？\" 兰登犹豫了一下。 \"牛奶。\"索菲低声说。\"我想英国人喜欢加牛奶。\" \"牛奶。\"兰登答道。 沉默。 \"要不，就加糖吧？\" 提彬仍旧没有回答。 等一下。兰登突然想起了上次来访时喝的苦茶，意识到这个问题是个圈套。\"柠檬！\"他大声说道：\"伯爵红茶加柠檬。\" \"好的。\"提彬听起来非常开心。\"我要问最后一个非常严肃的问题。\"提彬停顿了一下，然后用庄重的语气问：\"哈佛大学的划桨手，于哪一年在英国亨利市举办的划船比赛中胜过了牛津的划桨手？\" 兰登对此一无所知，但他却非常明了提彬提出这个问题的原因。于是，他答道：\"这种滑稽事从来就没有发生过。\"大门\"嗒\"的一声打开了。\"你有一颗真诚的心，我的朋友。你可以进来了。\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8605.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
