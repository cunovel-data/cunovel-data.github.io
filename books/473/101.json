{"id":30241,"no":101,"title":"Chapter 100","content":"Bishop Manuel Aringarosa\u0027s body had endured many kinds of pain, and yet the searing heat of thebullet wound in his chest felt profoundly foreign to him. Deep and grave. Not a wound of theflesh... but closer to the soul.\\n\\n 　　He opened his eyes, trying to see, but the rain on his face blurred his vision. Where am I? He couldfeel powerful arms holding him, carrying his limp body like a rag doll, his black cassock flapping.\\n\\n 　　Lifting a weary arm, he mopped his eyes and saw the man holding him was Silas. The great albinowas struggling down a misty sidewalk, shouting for a hospital, his voice a heartrending wail ofagony. His red eyes were focused dead ahead, tears streaming down his pale, blood-spattered face.\\n\\n 　　\"My son,\" Aringarosa whispered, \"you\u0027re hurt.\"Silas glanced down, his visage contorted in anguish. \"I am so very sorry, Father.\" He seemedalmost too pained to speak.\\n\\n 　　\"No, Silas,\" Aringarosa replied. \"It is I who am sorry. This is my fault.\" The Teacher promised methere would be no killing, and I told you to obey him fully. \"I was too eager. Too fearful. You and Iwere deceived.\" The Teacher was never going to deliver us the Holy Grail.\\n\\n 　　Cradled in the arms of the man he had taken in all those years ago, Bishop Aringarosa felt himselfreel back in time. To Spain. To his modest beginnings, building a small Catholic church in Oviedowith Silas. And later, to New York City, where he had proclaimed the glory of God with thetowering Opus Dei Center on Lexington Avenue.\\n\\n 　　Five months ago, Aringarosa had received devastating news. His life\u0027s work was in jeopardy. Herecalled, with vivid detail, the meeting inside Castel Gandolfo that had changed his life... the newsthat had set this entire calamity into motion.\\n\\n 　　Aringarosa had entered Gandolfo\u0027s Astronomy Library with his head held high, fully expecting tobe lauded by throngs of welcoming hands, all eager to pat him on the back for his superior workrepresenting Catholicism in America.\\n\\n 　　But only three people were present.\\n\\n 　　The Vatican secretariat. Obese. Dour.\\n\\n 　　Two high-ranking Italian cardinals. Sanctimonious. Smug.\\n\\n 　　\"Secretariat?\" Aringarosa said, puzzled.\\n\\n 　　The rotund overseer of legal affairs shook Aringarosa\u0027s hand and motioned to the chair oppositehim. \"Please, make yourself comfortable.\"Aringarosa sat, sensing something was wrong.\\n\\n 　　\"I am not skilled in small talk, Bishop,\" the secretariat said, \"so let me be direct about the reasonfor your visit.\"\"Please. Speak openly.\" Aringarosa glanced at the two cardinals, who seemed to be measuring himwith self-righteous anticipation.\\n\\n 　　\"As you are well aware,\" the secretariat said, \"His Holiness and others in Rome have beenconcerned lately with the political fallout from Opus Dei\u0027s more controversial practices.\"Aringarosa felt himself bristle instantly. He already had been through this on numerous occasionswith the new pontiff, who, to Aringarosa\u0027s great dismay, had turned out to be a distressingly ferventvoice for liberal change in the Church.\\n\\n 　　\"I want to assure you,\" the secretariat added quickly, \"that His Holiness does not seek to changeanything about the way you run your ministry.\"I should hope not! \"Then why am I here?\"The enormous man sighed. \"Bishop, I am not sure how to say this delicately, so I will state itdirectly. Two days ago, the Secretariat Council voted unanimously to revoke the Vatican\u0027s sanctionof Opus Dei.\"Aringarosa was certain he had heard incorrectly. \"I beg your pardon?\"\"Plainly stated, six months from today, Opus Dei will no longer be considered a prelature of theVatican. You will be a church unto yourself. The Holy See will be disassociating itself from you.\\n\\n 　　His Holiness agrees and we are already drawing up the legal papers.\"\"But... that is impossible!\"\"On the contrary, it is quite possible. And necessary. His Holiness has become uneasy with youraggressive recruiting policies and your practices of corporal mortification.\" He paused. \"Also yourpolicies regarding women. Quite frankly, Opus Dei has become a liability and an embarrassment.\"Bishop Aringarosa was stupefied. \"An embarrassment?\"\"Certainly you cannot be surprised it has come to this.\"\"Opus Dei is the only Catholic organization whose numbers are growing! We now have overeleven hundred priests!\"\"True. A troubling issue for us all.\"Aringarosa shot to his feet. \"Ask His Holiness if Opus Dei was an embarrassment in 1982 when wehelped the Vatican Bank!\"\"The Vatican will always be grateful for that,\" the secretariat said, his tone appeasing, \"and yetthere are those who still believe your financial munificence in 1982 is the only reason you weregranted prelature status in the first place.\"\"That is not true!\" The insinuation offended Aringarosa deeply.\\n\\n 　　\"Whatever the case, we plan to act in good faith. We are drawing up severance terms that willinclude a reimbursement of those monies. It will be paid in five installments.\"\"You are buying me off?\" Aringarosa demanded. \"Paying me to go quietly? When Opus Dei is theonly remaining voice of reason!\"One of the cardinals glanced up. \"I\u0027m sorry, did you say reason?\"Aringarosa leaned across the table, sharpening his tone to a point. \"Do you really wonder whyCatholics are leaving the Church? Look around you, Cardinal. People have lost respect. The rigorsof faith are gone. The doctrine has become a buffet line. Abstinence, confession, communion,baptism, mass—take your pick—choose whatever combination pleases you and ignore the rest.\\n\\n 　　What kind of spiritual guidance is the Church offering?\"\"Third-century laws,\" the second cardinal said, \"cannot be applied to the modern followers ofChrist. The rules are not workable in today\u0027s society.\"\"Well, they seem to be working for Opus Dei!\"\"Bishop Aringarosa,\" the secretariat said, his voice conclusive. \"Out of respect for yourorganization\u0027s relationship with the previous Pope, His Holiness will be giving Opus Dei sixmonths to voluntarily break away from the Vatican. I suggest you cite your differences of opinionwith the Holy See and establish yourself as your own Christian organization.\"\"I refuse!\" Aringarosa declared. \"And I\u0027ll tell him that in person!\"\"I\u0027m afraid His Holiness no longer cares to meet with you.\"Aringarosa stood up. \"He would not dare abolish a personal prelature established by a previousPope!\"\"I\u0027m sorry.\" The secretariat\u0027s eyes did not flinch. \"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.\"Aringarosa had staggered from that meeting in bewilderment and panic. Returning to New York,he stared out at the skyline in disillusionment for days, overwhelmed with sadness for the future ofChristianity.\\n\\n 　　It was several weeks later that he received the phone call that changed all that. The caller soundedFrench and identified himself as the Teacher—a title common in the prelature. He said he knew ofthe Vatican\u0027s plans to pull support from Opus Dei.\\n\\n 　　How could he know that? Aringarosa wondered. He had hoped only a handful of Vatican powerbrokers knew of Opus Dei\u0027s impending annulment. Apparently the word was out. When it came tocontaining gossip, no walls in the world were as porous as those surrounding Vatican City.\\n\\n 　　\"I have ears everywhere, Bishop,\" the Teacher whispered, \"and with these ears I have gainedcertain knowledge. With your help, I can uncover the hiding place of a sacred relic that will bringyou enormous power... enough power to make the Vatican bow before you. Enough power to savethe Faith.\" He paused. \"Not just for Opus Dei. But for all of us.\"The Lord taketh away... and the Lord giveth. Aringarosa felt a glorious ray of hope. \"Tell me yourplan.\"Bishop Aringarosa was unconscious when the doors of St. Mary\u0027s Hospital hissed open. Silaslurched into the entryway delirious with exhaustion. Dropping to his knees on the tile floor, hecried out for help. Everyone in the reception area gaped in wonderment at the half-naked albinooffering forth a bleeding clergyman.\\n\\n 　　The doctor who helped Silas heave the delirious bishop onto a gurney looked gloomy as he feltAringarosa\u0027s pulse. \"He\u0027s lost a lot of blood. I am not hopeful.\"Aringarosa\u0027s eyes flickered, and he returned for a moment, his gaze locating Silas. \"My child...\"Silas\u0027s soul thundered with remorse and rage. \"Father, if it takes my lifetime, I will find the onewho deceived us, and I will kill him.\"Aringarosa shook his head, looking sad as they prepared to wheel him away. \"Silas... if you havelearned nothing from me, please... learn this.\" He took Silas\u0027s hand and gave it a firm squeeze.\\n\\n 　　\"Forgiveness is God\u0027s greatest gift.\"\"But Father...\"Aringarosa closed his eyes. \"Silas, you must pray.\"\\n\\n 曼努阿尔。阿林加洛沙主教经受过各种各样肉体上的苦难，然而子弹射人胸膛冒出来的灼人热气，却使他产生一种非常异样的感觉。它深入肺腑，却又痛彻心扉。令人觉得这不是肉体上的伤痛，而是近乎于精神上的磨难了。\\n\\n 他睁开双眼，努力想看看面前有些什么，然而雨水落在他的脸上，模糊了他的视线。\\n\\n 我在哪里呢？他觉得有双强壮有力的胳膊托住了他，那人抱住他虚弱的身体，就像抱着一个破旧的布娃娃。他的黑色长袍，被风\"呼啦啦\"地吹了起来。\\n\\n 他抬起虚弱的胳膊，抹去脸上的雨水，终于看清了那人是塞拉斯。这位块头硕大的白化病患者，正沿着雨雾缭绕的人行道，踉踉跄跄地走着，他大声呼喊，希望有医院闻声前来搭救。声音撼人心魄，仿佛是痛苦的哀鸣。他通红的眼睛，坚定地望着远方；止不住的泪水，从他苍白的、血迹斑斑的脸上流了下来。\\n\\n \"孩子，\"阿林加洛沙主教轻轻地说道：\"你受伤了。\"\\n\\n 塞拉斯低头看看，脸上的表情由于极度痛苦而扭曲。\"神父，我真的很抱歉。\"他似乎快要痛苦得说不出话来。\\n\\n \"塞拉斯，你快别这么说，\"阿林加洛沙主教赶忙回答：\"说对不起的应该是我。这都是我的错。\"教主答应过我，说不会有人死的；而我也叫你完全听命于他。\"我太急于求成，也太担惊受怕。结果我们两人都被人骗了。\"教主根本就未曾打算把圣杯交给我们啊。\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙主教躺在这位多年前他收留的男人的怀里，觉得自己纷飞的思绪立刻又回到了从前，回到了西班牙，回到了当年他辛苦起家的地方--在奥维耶多市，他带着塞拉斯建造了一座很小的天主教堂；再后来，他的思绪又飞到了纽约，在那里，他与坐落在莱克星顿大街上的高耸入云的天主事工会中心一起演绎了上帝的辉煌。\\n\\n 五个月前，阿林加洛沙主教得到了颇令他气馁的消息。他终生的事业由此走到了危险的边缘。他至今还能想起那次在岗道尔夫堡会面的每一个细节，他的人生由于那次会面而彻底被改变了……那条引发这场灾难的消息，他至今依然记得。\\n\\n 那天，阿林加洛沙主教高昂着头颅，走进了岗道尔夫堡的天文图书馆，他满以为会有无数人前来迎接他，急不可待地走上前来，拍拍他的后背，然后他在美国为基督教作出的杰出贡献倍加赞美。\\n\\n 然而，使他失望的是，里面迎接他的只有三个人。\\n\\n 一位是是梵蒂冈罗马教廷的秘书，他身材臃肿，脸色阴沉。\\n\\n 还有两位意大利的高级红衣主教，洋洋得意，却假装非常的虔诚。\\n\\n 那名身材圆嘟嘟的罗马教廷法律事务负责人，握了握阿林加洛沙主教的手，然后示意他在对面的椅子上坐下。\"请坐，不要有什么拘谨。\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙主教坐到椅子上，然而他总觉得有什么地方不对劲。\\n\\n 这位秘书又开口了：\"主教，我这人不太善于唠叨家常，所以，还是让我直接挑明叫你来的原因吧。\"\"那你就直说吧。\"阿林加洛沙主教瞥了瞥两位红衣主教，他们似乎正在掂量着他，表情很是自持，却又满怀期待。\\n\\n \"你应该非常清楚，\"秘书说道：\"最近教皇陛下以及罗马教廷的其他人，一直很关注天主事工会颇有争议的做法所带来的政治影响。\"阿林加洛沙主教顿时气得连毛发都竖了起来。这件事，他已经不知在多少次的场合里跟这位新任的教皇交代过了，然而，令他沮丧的是，他原来还以为这位新教皇是在教会中实行民主改革的热烈拥护者呢。\\n\\n \"我向你保证，\"那位秘书很快地补充了一句：\"教皇陛下对你的管理方式，并没打算作任何的改变。\"\\n\\n 我倒不希望有什么改变呢！阿林加洛沙主教心想。\"那叫我到这里来，又是什么意思？\\n\\n \"这位身材庞大的男人叹了一口气，说：\"主教，我不知道怎样说才能说得得体，所以我不妨直说了吧。两天前，我们秘书处进行无记名投票，否决了梵蒂冈颁布的针对天主事工会的法令。\"阿林加洛沙主教怀疑是自己听错了。\"你说什么？\"\\n\\n \"说白了，就是从今天起以后六个月，罗马教廷将不再将天主事工会视为它麾下的一员。你的教会是你自己的教会，圣座也将与你脱离干系。教皇业已同意，我们也已经在起草相关的法律文件。\"\"但--但那是不可能的！\"\\n\\n \"恰恰相反，这很有可能，也是很有必要的。教皇陛下已对你咄咄逼人的招收教徒的政策以及肉体苦修的做法深感不安。\"他停顿了一下。\"还有，他对你们的妇女政策也非常的不满。坦率地说，天主事工会已经成了罗马教廷的负担，也使它感到难堪！\"阿林加洛沙主教呆住了：\"使它难堪？\"\\n\\n \"事情发展到今天这个地步，你肯定很奇怪吧？\"\\n\\n \"但天主事工会是唯一的教徒在不断增加的天主教组织。迄今为止我们已有1100 多名牧师。\"\"不错，但却使我们陷入了困境。\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙主教忽地站了起来：\"你去问教皇陛下，1982 年天主事工会协助梵蒂冈银行摆脱困境时，有没有使他难堪？\"\\n\\n \"对那件事，罗马教廷会永远感激你们的。\"秘书语气平静地说：\"不过还是有人相信，你之所以被优先封为主教，唯一的原因就是因为1982 年你的那次慷慨的馈赠。\"\"这不是真的。\"阿林加洛沙主教觉得自己被深深地伤害了。\\n\\n \"不管怎样，我们确实有这个打算。我们正在起草脱离彼此关系的条款，其中也包括对那笔钱的偿还。我们将分五次付清欠款。\"\"你们想用钱打发我吗？\"阿林加洛沙质问道：\"你们给我钱，好让我安安静静地走开？\\n\\n 眼下，也就剩下天主事工会在发出理性的声音了！\"其中一位红衣主教抬起头：\"对不起，你是说理性？\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙主教俯到桌子上，声音提高了八度：\"你们果真不知道教徒们脱离天主教会的原因么？还是看看你周围吧，大主教。人们已经对它失去了敬重。过去恪守信仰的作风已不见了，教规也成了一纸空文。什么禁欲、忏悔、圣餐、洗礼，还有弥撒--你们挑来拣去--选择了其中的几样，然后就将其余的清规戒律抛在脑后。你说，在精神上，天主教会又能给人们指点什么样的迷津呢？\"\\n\\n \"那都是一些3 世纪的陈规陋习了，\"另外一位红衣主教说：\"不适用于现代的基督徒。\\n\\n 这些法规，在今天这个社会里已经行不通了。\"\"是吗？不过似乎对天主事工会还有用呢！\"\\n\\n \"阿林加洛沙主教，\"秘书好像在做总结性陈词似的说道：\"教皇陛下出于对贵组织与前任教皇关系的尊重，将给天主事工会六个月的时间，主动与罗马教廷断绝关系。我建议你利用你与圣座之间的分歧，创立属于你自己的基督教组织。\"\"我反对。\"阿林加洛沙大声宣称：\"我要亲自质问教皇陛下。\"\\n\\n \"只怕教皇陛下不想再见到你了。\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙主教站了起来：\"谅他也不敢轻易罢免前任教皇赐封的主教职位吧。\"\\n\\n \"对不起，\"秘书的眼皮没眨一下。\"上帝之所予，为上帝之所取。\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙主教跌跌撞撞地走了出来，内心一阵恐惧与茫然。他回到纽约，万念俱灰，整天望着天空发呆。一想到基督教的未来，他的内心就充满了悲哀。\\n\\n 他是在几个星期之后，才接到那个改变了一切的电话的。打电话的人说话听起来很像是法国人，并自称是教主--这是高级教士之职中极为普通的头衔，他说他知道罗马教廷不打算再给予天主事工会任何的支持。\\n\\n 他怎么知道的？阿林加洛沙主教大惑不解。他原本希望只有一小撮罗马教廷的政治掮客知道天主事工会即将与罗马教廷断绝关系的消息，显然是有人走漏风声了。说到遏制流言蜚语，那么除了梵蒂冈城四周的围墙，世上还没有哪个地方的高墙能具有如此强的渗透力。\\n\\n \"我在各处都有耳目。\"教主低声地说：\"通过这些耳目我总能得到某些信息。如果你愿意帮忙，我就能找到藏有神圣遗迹的地方，它将给你带来巨大的影响，你将获得足够的力量，使罗马教廷对你俯首称臣；你也将获得足够的力量，来拯救我们的信仰。\"他略微停了停：\"这不仅对天主事工会有利，也是为我们大家着想。\"\\n\\n 为上帝之所取……上帝之所予。阿林加洛沙主教仿佛看到了希望的曙光。\"那你给我说说，你有什么打算。\"圣玛丽医院的门\"吱呀\"一声打开了，此时，阿林加洛沙主教已经失去了知觉。塞拉斯筋疲力尽，一下子扑倒在进门的通道上。他双膝跪地，大声地呼救。接待室里的所有人，看到这位半裸着身子的白化病患者怀抱着一位满身是血的牧师，都吓得目瞪口呆。\\n\\n 那名来帮塞拉斯将昏迷不醒的主教抬上轮床的大夫，在给阿林加洛沙把脉时，脸上的神情很是令人沮丧。\"他失血过多，我看没有多少生还的希望。\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙主教的眼睛忽然闪动了一下，他又清醒了片刻，眼睛直勾勾的看着塞拉斯：\"孩子--\"\\n\\n 懊悔与愤怒，如闪电般将塞拉斯淹没。\"神父，我就是花上一辈子的时间，也要找到那个欺骗我们的人，亲手宰了他。\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙主教摇了摇头，神情很是悲伤，这时医院的人过来准备把他推走。\"塞拉斯……如果你没从我这里学到什么，那请你--请你看看这个吧。\"他抓住塞拉斯的手，用力掐了一下：\"记住，宽恕是上帝此给我们的最好礼物。\"\\n\\n \"可是神父--\"\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙主教闭上眼睛，说：\"塞拉斯，你应该做祷告了。\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8653.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
