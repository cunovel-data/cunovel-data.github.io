{"id":30192,"no":52,"title":"Chapter 51","content":"Even at a modest sixty kilometers an hour, the dangling front bumper of the armored truck gratedagainst the deserted suburban road with a grinding roar, spraying sparks up onto the hood.\\n\\n 　　We\u0027ve got to get off the road, Langdon thought.\\n\\n 　　He could barely even see where they were headed. The truck\u0027s lone working headlight had beenknocked off-center and was casting a skewed sidelong beam into the woods beside the countryhighway. Apparently the armor in this \"armored truck\" referred only to the cargo hold and not thefront end.\\n\\n 　　Sophie sat in the passenger seat, staring blankly at the rosewood box on her lap.\\n\\n 　　\"Are you okay?\" Langdon asked.\\n\\n 　　Sophie looked shaken. \"Do you believe him?\"\"About the three additional murders? Absolutely. It answers a lot of questions—the issue of yourgrandfather\u0027s desperation to pass on the keystone, as well as the intensity with which Fache ishunting me.\"\"No, I meant about Vernet trying to protect his bank.\"Langdon glanced over. \"As opposed to?\"\"Taking the keystone for himself.\"Langdon had not even considered it. \"How would he even know what this box contains?\"\"His bank stored it. He knew my grandfather. Maybe he knew things. He might have decided hewanted the Grail for himself.\"Langdon shook his head. Vernet hardly seemed the type. \"In my experience, there are only tworeasons people seek the Grail. Either they are naive and believe they are searching for the long-lostCup of Christ...\"\"Or?\"\"Or they know the truth and are threatened by it. Many groups throughout history have sought todestroy the Grail.\"The silence between them accentuated the sound of the scraping bumper. They had driven a fewkilometers now, and as Langdon watched the cascade of sparks coming off the front of the truck,he wondered if it was dangerous. Either way, if they passed another car, it would certainly drawattention. Langdon made up his mind.\\n\\n 　　\"I\u0027m going to see if I can bend this bumper back.\"Pulling onto the shoulder, he brought the truck to a stop.\\n\\n 　　Silence at last.\\n\\n 　　As Langdon walked toward the front of the truck, he felt surprisingly alert. Staring into the barrelof yet another gun tonight had given him a second wind. He took a deep breath of nighttime air andtried to get his wits about him. Accompanying the gravity of being a hunted man, Langdon wasstarting to feel the ponderous weight of responsibility, the prospect that he and Sophie mightactually be holding an encrypted set of directions to one of the most enduring mysteries of all time.\\n\\n 　　As if this burden were not great enough, Langdon now realized that any possibility of finding away to return the keystone to the Priory had just evaporated. News of the three additional murdershad dire implications. The Priory has been infiltrated. They are compromised. The brotherhoodwas obviously being watched, or there was a mole within the ranks. It seemed to explain whySaunière might have transferred the keystone to Sophie and Langdon—people outside thebrotherhood, people he knew were not compromised. We can\u0027t very well give the keystone back tothe brotherhood. Even if Langdon had any idea how to find a Priory member, chances were goodthat whoever stepped forward to take the keystone could be the enemy himself. For the moment, atleast, it seemed the keystone was in Sophie and Langdon\u0027s hands, whether they wanted it or not.\\n\\n 　　The truck\u0027s front end looked worse than Langdon had imagined. The left headlight was gone, andthe right one looked like an eyeball dangling from its socket. Langdon straightened it, and itdislodged again. The only good news was that the front bumper had been torn almost clean off.\\n\\n 　　Langdon gave it a hard kick and sensed he might be able to break it off entirely.\\n\\n 　　As he repeatedly kicked the twisted metal, Langdon recalled his earlier conversation with Sophie.\\n\\n 　　My grandfather left me a phone message, Sophie had told him. He said he needed to tell me thetruth about my family. At the time it had meant nothing, but now, knowing the Priory of Sion wasinvolved, Langdon felt a startling new possibility emerge.\\n\\n 　　The bumper broke off suddenly with a crash. Langdon paused to catch his breath. At least the truckwould no longer look like a Fourth of July sparkler. He grabbed the bumper and began dragging itout of sight into the woods, wondering where they should go next. They had no idea how to openthe cryptex, or why Saunière had given it to them. Unfortunately, their survival tonight seemed todepend on getting answers to those very questions.\\n\\n 　　We need help, Langdon decided. Professional help.\\n\\n 　　In the world of the Holy Grail and the Priory of Sion, that meant only one man. The challenge, ofcourse, would be selling the idea to Sophie.\\n\\n 　　Inside the armored car, while Sophie waited for Langdon to return, she could feel the weight of therosewood box on her lap and resented it. Why did my grandfather give this to me? She had not theslightest idea what to do with it.\\n\\n 　　Think, Sophie! Use your head. Grand-père is trying to tell you something!\\n\\n 　　Opening the box, she eyed the cryptex\u0027s dials. A proof of merit. She could feel her grandfather\u0027shand at work. The keystone is a map that can be followed only by the worthy. It sounded like hergrandfather to the core.\\n\\n 　　Lifting the cryptex out of the box, Sophie ran her fingers over the dials. Five letters. She rotated thedials one by one. The mechanism moved smoothly. She aligned the disks such that her chosenletters lined up between the cryptex\u0027s two brass alignment arrows on either end of the cylinder. Thedials now spelled a five-letter word that Sophie knew was absurdly obvious.\\n\\n 　　G-R-A-I-L.\\n\\n 　　Gently, she held the two ends of the cylinder and pulled, applying pressure slowly. The cryptexdidn\u0027t budge. She heard the vinegar inside gurgle and stopped pulling. Then she tried again.\\n\\n 　　V-I-N-C-IAgain, no movement.\\n\\n 　　V-O-U-T-ENothing. The cryptex remained locked solid.\\n\\n 　　Frowning, she replaced it in the rosewood box and closed the lid. Looking outside at Langdon,Sophie felt grateful he was with her tonight. P.S. Find Robert Langdon. Her grandfather\u0027s rationalefor including him was now clear. Sophie was not equipped to understand her grandfather\u0027sintentions, and so he had assigned Robert Langdon as her guide. A tutor to oversee her education.\\n\\n 　　Unfortunately for Langdon, he had turned out to be far more than a tutor tonight. He had becomethe target of Bezu Fache... and some unseen force intent on possessing the Holy Grail.\\n\\n 　　Whatever the Grail turns out to be.\\n\\n 　　Sophie wondered if finding out was worth her life.\\n\\n 　　As the armored truck accelerated again, Langdon was pleased how much more smoothly it drove.\\n\\n 　　\"Do you know how to get to Versailles?\"Sophie eyed him. \"Sightseeing?\"\"No, I have a plan. There\u0027s a religious historian I know who lives near Versailles. I can\u0027t rememberexactly where, but we can look it up. I\u0027ve been to his estate a few times. His name is LeighTeabing. He\u0027s a former British Royal Historian.\"\"And he lives in Paris?\"\"Teabing\u0027s life passion is the Grail. When whisperings of the Priory keystone surfaced about fifteenyears ago, he moved to France to search churches in hopes of finding it. He\u0027s written some bookson the keystone and the Grail. He may be able to help us figure out how to open it and what to dowith it.\"Sophie\u0027s eyes were wary. \"Can you trust him?\"\"Trust him to what? Not steal the information?\"\"And not to turn us in.\"\"I don\u0027t intend to tell him we\u0027re wanted by the police. I\u0027m hoping he\u0027ll take us in until we can sortall this out.\"\"Robert, has it occurred to you that every television in France is probably getting ready tobroadcast our pictures? Bezu Fache always uses the media to his advantage. He\u0027ll make itimpossible for us to move around without being recognized.\"Terrific, Langdon thought. My French TV debut will be on \"Paris\u0027s Most Wanted.\" At least JonasFaukman would be pleased; every time Langdon made the news, his book sales jumped.\\n\\n 　　\"Is this man a good enough friend?\" Sophie asked.\\n\\n 　　Langdon doubted Teabing was someone who watched television, especially at this hour, but stillthe question deserved consideration. Instinct told Langdon that Teabing would be totallytrustworthy. An ideal safe harbor. Considering the circumstances, Teabing would probably tripover himself to help them as much as possible. Not only did he owe Langdon a favor, but Teabingwas a Grail researcher, and Sophie claimed her grandfather was the actual Grand Master of thePriory of Sion. If Teabing heard that, he would salivate at the thought of helping them figure thisout.\\n\\n 　　\"Teabing could be a powerful ally,\" Langdon said. Depending on how much you want to tell him.\\n\\n 　　\"Fache probably will be offering a monetary reward.\"Langdon laughed. \"Believe me, money is the last thing this guy needs.\" Leigh Teabing waswealthy in the way small countries were wealthy. A descendant of Britain\u0027s First Duke ofLancaster, Teabing had gotten his money the old-fashioned way—he\u0027d inherited it. His estateoutside of Paris was a seventeenth-century palace with two private lakes.\\n\\n 　　Langdon had first met Teabing several years ago through the British Broadcasting Corporation.\\n\\n 　　Teabing had approached the BBC with a proposal for a historical documentary in which he wouldexpose the explosive history of the Holy Grail to a mainstream television audience. The BBCproducers loved Teabing\u0027s hot premise, his research, and his credentials, but they had concerns thatthe concept was so shocking and hard to swallow that the network might end up tarnishing itsreputation for quality journalism. At Teabing\u0027s suggestion, the BBC solved its credibility fears bysoliciting three cameos from respected historians from around the world, all of whom corroboratedthe stunning nature of the Holy Grail secret with their own research.\\n\\n 　　Langdon had been among those chosen.\\n\\n 　　The BBC had flown Langdon to Teabing\u0027s Paris estate for the filming. He sat before cameras inTeabing\u0027s opulent drawing room and shared his story, admitting his initial skepticism on hearing ofthe alternate Holy Grail story, then describing how years of research had persuaded him that thestory was true. Finally, Langdon offered some of his own research—a series of symbologicconnections that strongly supported the seemingly controversial claims.\\n\\n 　　When the program aired in Britain, despite its ensemble cast and well-documented evidence, thepremise rubbed so hard against the grain of popular Christian thought that it instantly confronted afirestorm of hostility. It never aired in the States, but the repercussions echoed across the Atlantic.\\n\\n 　　Shortly afterward, Langdon received a postcard from an old friend—the Catholic Bishop ofPhiladelphia. The card simply read: Et tu, Robert?\\n\\n 　　\"Robert,\" Sophie asked, \"you\u0027re certain we can trust this man?\"\"Absolutely. We\u0027re colleagues, he doesn\u0027t need money, and I happen to know he despises theFrench authorities. The French government taxes him at absurd rates because he bought a historiclandmark. He\u0027ll be in no hurry to cooperate with Fache.\"Sophie stared out at the dark roadway. \"If we go to him, how much do you want to tell him?\"Langdon looked unconcerned. \"Believe me, Leigh Teabing knows more about the Priory of Sionand the Holy Grail than anyone on earth.\"Sophie eyed him. \"More than my grandfather?\"\"I meant more than anyone outside the brotherhood.\"\"How do you know Teabing isn\u0027t a member of the brotherhood?\"\"Teabing has spent his life trying to broadcast the truth about the Holy Grail. The Priory\u0027s oath is tokeep its true nature hidden.\"\"Sounds to me like a conflict of interest.\"Langdon understood her concerns. Saunière had given the cryptex directly to Sophie, and althoughshe didn\u0027t know what it contained or what she was supposed to do with it, she was hesitant toinvolve a total stranger. Considering the information potentially enclosed, the instinct was probablya good one. \"We don\u0027t need to tell Teabing about the keystone immediately. Or at all, even. Hishouse will give us a place to hide and think, and maybe when we talk to him about the Grail, you\u0027llstart to have an idea why your grandfather gave this to you.\"\"Us,\" Sophie reminded.\\n\\n 　　Langdon felt a humble pride and wondered yet again why Saunière had included him.\\n\\n 　　\"Do you know more or less where Mr. Teabing lives?\" Sophie asked.\\n\\n 　　\"His estate is called Chateau Villette.\"Sophie turned with an incredulous look. \"The Chateau Villette?\"\"That\u0027s the one.\"\"Nice friends.\"\"You know the estate?\"\"I\u0027ve passed it. It\u0027s in the castle district. Twenty minutes from here.\"Langdon frowned. \"That far?\"\"Yes, which will give you enough time to tell me what the Holy Grail really is.\"Langdon paused. \"I\u0027ll tell you at Teabing\u0027s. He and I specialize in different areas of the legend, sobetween the two of us, you\u0027ll get the full story.\" Langdon smiled. \"Besides, the Grail has beenTeabing\u0027s life, and hearing the story of the Holy Grail from Leigh Teabing will be like hearing thetheory of relativity from Einstein himself.\"\"Let\u0027s hope Leigh doesn\u0027t mind late-night visitors.\"\"For the record, it\u0027s Sir Leigh.\" Langdon had made that mistake only once. \"Teabing is quite acharacter. He was knighted by the Queen several years back after composing an extensive historyon the House of York.\"Sophie looked over. \"You\u0027re kidding, right? We\u0027re going to visit a knight?\"Langdon gave an awkward smile. \"We\u0027re on a Grail quest, Sophie. Who better to help us than aknight?\"\\n\\n 就算只以60 公里的时速前行，装甲车上摇摇欲坠的保险杠在沙土路面上拖行，还是摩擦出了巨大的声响，擦出的火花不断飞溅到引擎盖上。\\n\\n 我们必须离开这条路，兰登寻思道。\\n\\n 他甚至看不清前进的方向。装甲车那唯一能亮的车头灯被撞歪了，一条横梁也飞进了乡村公路边的树林里。显然，这辆车所谓的\"装甲\"指的不过是货舱而并非车头。\\n\\n 索菲坐在乘客席上，面无表情地看着膝上的木盒。\\n\\n \"你没事吧？\"兰登问道。\\n\\n 索菲看起来有些动摇：\"你相信他么？\"\\n\\n \"你指的是另外三宗谋杀？当然。这解释了很多事情--为什么你祖父拼命要将楔石传下来，为什么法希要极力追捕我。\"\"不，我指的是韦尔内竭力要保全他的银行。\"\\n\\n 兰登瞥了索菲一眼：\"而不是……？\"\\n\\n \"把楔石据为已有。\"\\n\\n 兰登根本没有考虑这个问题：\"他怎么可能知道这盒子里装的到底是什么呢？\"\\n\\n \"楔石被保存在他的银行，他认识祖父，也许他知道些什么，可能他下定决心一定要把圣杯搞到手。\"兰登摇了摇头。韦尔内不像这种人。\"依我看，人们寻找圣杯只有两个原因：不是他们幼稚地以为自己正在追寻遗失已久的耶稣用过的杯子……\"\"就是？\"\\n\\n \"就是他们了解真相，并因此受到威胁。历史上有很多组织曾经寻找并试图销毁圣杯。\"\\n\\n 车内的沉默使破保险杠发出的摩擦声更响了。现在他们已经开出了好几公里。兰登看着那瀑布般溅落在车头的火花，担心那会给行驶造成危险。再说，这一定会引起过往车辆的注意。于是兰登打定子主意。\\n\\n \"我下去看看能不能把保险杠扳回原位。\"\\n\\n 他把车靠边，开进一个车站。\\n\\n 噪音终于消失了。\\n\\n 兰登走向车头时极其警觉。现在，他不用再盯着枪管，终于能够自由地呼吸了。他深吸了一口夜晚的空气，让头脑恢复清醒。他不仅背负着被迫捕的压力，也开始感到一份沉甸甸的责任。他和索菲的命运将与一个历史上最重要的秘密联系在一起。\\n\\n 兰登感到肩头的担子沉重，因为他知道他们不能再将楔石送还隐修会了。另外三个人遇害的消息说明已经有外人打人了隐修会内部，他们妥协了。显然，隐修会的成员被人监视着，要么就是组织里混进了奸细。看来这就是索尼埃把楔石交给索菲和兰登的原因--他们不是隐修会的成员，他们是不会妥协的人。把楔石交还给隐修会是不妥当的。即使兰登有办法找到隐修会的成员，但很有可能来拿楔石的人恰恰就是敌人。至少现在，不管索菲和兰登想不想要，楔石还在他们手里。\\n\\n 装甲车的车头看上去比兰登想象的还要糟。左边的车头灯已经不见了，右边的那个就像在眼窝里晃荡的眼球。兰登把它塞回原处，它又滚落出来，唯一让人高兴的就是前保险杠就快要掉下来了。兰登飞起一脚，想把它踢掉。\\n\\n 他一边踹那块扭曲的金属，一边回忆着和索菲的谈话。索菲曾告诉他。\"祖父在电话中给我留言，说他要告诉我关于我家庭的真相\"。这句话在当时听来似乎毫无意义，但现在，当了解到郇山隐修会与此有关之后，兰登想出了一种令人吃惊的可能性。\\n\\n 前保险杠完全脱落了下来。兰登喘了口气。至少这辆车不会再好像燃放国庆节的烟花了。他拎起那条保险杠，把它拖到树林的隐蔽处，盘算着接下来的去向。他们不知道如何打开密码筒，也不知道为什么索尼埃会把这个交给他们。但不幸的是，他们今晚的生死存亡就取决于能否找到这些问题的答案。\\n\\n 兰登想道：我们需要专业的帮助。\\n\\n 在圣杯与郇山隐修会的研究领域，只有一个人可以帮上这个忙了。当然，最麻烦的问题是首先必须要说服索菲。\\n\\n 索菲呆在货舱里等着兰登，她感到膝盖上的紫檀木盒子沉沉的，对它心生厌恶。为什么祖父要给我这个？她百思不得其解。\\n\\n 思考，索菲！动动脑筋。祖父想告诉你什么？\\n\\n 索菲打开盒子，取出密码筒，仔细端详。她甚至可以感触到祖父制作密码筒的双手。\\n\\n 楔石是一个只有杰出的人才能读懂的地图。祖父就是那样一个\"杰出的人\"。\\n\\n 索菲抚摸着转筒。五个字母。石盘在她手中流畅地转动着。她把五个字母对准了石筒两端的铜箭头。这一举动看似荒谬，那五个字母组成了一个单词。\\n\\n G-R-A-I-L.\\n\\n 她轻轻地抓着圆柱体的两端往外拉。密码筒一动不动。她听见筒内响起醋的流动声，于是停了下来。她又试了一次。\\n\\n V-I-N-C-I.\\n\\n 还是没有动静。\\n\\n V-O-U-T-E.\\n\\n 密码筒依旧紧锁。\\n\\n 她皱着眉头把密码筒放回盒里。看着车外的兰登，索菲很感激他能够陪伴自己。附言：去找罗伯特。兰登。祖父要把他也拉进来的原因已经很清楚了。索菲还不知如何理解祖父的意图，因此祖父指定罗伯特。兰登做她的向导。一个全面指导她的老师。不幸的是，对兰登来说，他今晚可远远不止是老师，他变成了贝祖。法希的猎物……而且还有某些未知势力也在企图夺取圣杯。\\n\\n 圣杯到底是什么？\\n\\n 索菲怀疑最终的发现是否值得他们牺牲性命。\\n\\n 装甲车再次上路了。兰登觉得心情舒畅，因为驾驶变得轻松多了。\"你认识去凡尔赛的路吗？\"\\n\\n 索菲看着他：\"观光？\"\\n\\n \"不，我有个计划。我认识的一个宗教史学家住在凡尔赛附近。虽然我不记得具体的地址，但是我们可以去找找，我曾经去过他的庄园几次。他叫雷。提彬，是前英国皇家历史学家。\"\"他住在巴黎？\"\\n\\n \"提彬的生活激情就来自于圣杯。十五年前当隐修会楔石现身的传说散布开来时，他搬到法国，希望能够在教堂里找到圣杯。他也写过一些关于楔石和圣杯的书。也许他可以帮助我们打开这个密码筒并且告诉我们如何处置它。\"索菲的眼神中充满警惕：\"你信任他么？\"\\n\\n \"相信他什么？不会盗窃信息？\"\\n\\n \"而且不会把我们交出去。\"\\n\\n \"我并不打算告诉他我们正被警方通缉。我希望他会收留我们直到真相大白。\"\\n\\n \"罗伯特，不要忘了，法国的每一台电视机都可能正在播出咱们的照片。贝祖。法希经常利用媒体，他会让我们寸步难行。\"太棒了，兰登想。我的荧屏处女秀就要献给\"巴黎通缉犯\"节目了。至少琼纳斯。福克曼要幸灾乐祸了：每次兰登弄出什么新闻来，他的书一定会卖疯的。\\n\\n \"他真的是靠得住的朋友吗？\"索菲问。\\n\\n 兰登也拿不准提彬是不是会看电视，特别是在这个时段，不过直觉告诉兰登，提彬是完全值得信任的。一个理想的避风港。鉴于当前的情况，提彬应该会全力帮助他们的。这不仅是因为他欠兰登一个人情，而且也因为提彬是一个执着的圣杯研究者。索菲声称她祖父是郇山隐修会的掌门人，而提彬一旦知道这些，定会渴望帮助他们揭开谜底。\\n\\n \"提彬将会是一个有力的盟友。\"兰登说。\"不过，这还要看你打算告诉他多少实情。\"\\n\\n \"法希很可能会悬赏。\"\\n\\n 兰登笑了。\"相信我，钱对此人来说是最次要的需求。\"雷。提彬富可敌国，作为英国兰卡斯特公爵一世的后代，提彬用传统的方法--继承--获得了钱财。他在巴黎郊外的庄园是一座拥有两个私人湖泊的十七世纪宫殿。\\n\\n 兰登是在几年前通过BBC 第一次见到提彬的。提彬找到BBC，想通过主流媒体向人们揭示一段关于圣杯的爆炸性历史事实。BBC 的制片人对提彬的假设、研究和证据都非常感兴趣，但是他认为这些观点实在太令人难以接受，担心节目会影响广播网在新闻界的盛名。在提彬的建议下，BBC 恳请世界各地的著名历史学家帮助解决信任危机，请他们通过各自的研究证实那则令人震惊的圣杯秘密。\\n\\n 兰登就是被选中的学者之一。\\n\\n BBC 曾经让兰登飞去提彬的庄园协助拍摄。他在提彬富丽堂皇的画室里面对着摄像机讲述他的观点，从他对圣杯故事的怀疑讲到数年来自己对这个问题的研究。最后，兰登提供了一些自己的研究成果--一系列象征性的联系有力地支持了提彬的主张。\\n\\n 虽然这个节目在英国拍摄时排出了强大的拍摄阵容并提供了充分的证据，可还是由于它跟大多数基督徒的看法有激烈冲突而招致了强烈的不满。这个节目没有在大西洋彼岸的美国播出，可却也在那里引起了强烈的反响。节目在英国播出后不久，兰登接到了来自老朋友、费城基督教主教的一张明信片。上面简单地写道：\"是你干的吗，罗伯特？\"\\n\\n \"罗伯特。\"索菲问道。\"你肯定那个人值得信任吗？\"\\n\\n \"绝对肯定。我们是朋友，而且他不缺钱。碰巧，他很讨厌法国政府。法国政府向他征收高得出奇的地皮税，理由是他买的那块地是著名的风景区。他绝对不会和法希合作的。\"索菲望着车窗外漆黑的公路，问道：\"要是我们去找他的话，你打算告诉他多少情况呢？\"\\n\\n 兰登满不在乎地说：\"相信我，关于隐修会和圣杯，雷。提彬知道得比世界上任何人都多。\"索菲看着他问道：\"比祖父知道得多吗？\"\\n\\n \"我是说比隐修会之外的人知道得多。\"\\n\\n \"那你怎么知道提彬不是隐修会的人呢？\"\\n\\n \"提彬一生都在试图告诉人们圣杯的真相。而隐修会则是要隐藏圣杯的实质。\"\\n\\n \"听上去似乎有利益上的冲突。\"\\n\\n 兰登明白她的担忧。索尼埃把密码筒交给了索菲，虽然索菲不知道里面装着什么，也不知道如何处置它，可她不会情愿把一个陌生人牵扯到这件事里来。密码筒里可能隐藏着重大秘密，凭直觉办事也许没错。\"我们不需要马上告诉提彬关于楔石的事。或者根本就不告诉他。我们可以藏在他家，同时也可以好好思考一下。也许当我们跟他谈论圣杯的时候。你能搞明白祖父把楔石交给你的原因呢。\"\"祖父是把它交给了你和我。\"索菲提醒道。\\n\\n 兰登感到有些自豪，不过也再一次为索尼埃把他牵扯进来而大惑不解。\\n\\n \"你应该对提彬先生的住处有所了解吧？\"索菲问道。\\n\\n \"他住的地方叫维莱特庄园。\"\\n\\n 索菲以怀疑的眼光看着他：\"你是说那曾是皇室的维莱特庄园吗？\"\\n\\n \"正是。\"\\n\\n \"那他可是个友善的人啊。\"\\n\\n \"你知道那个地方？\"\\n\\n \"我以前从那里经过。在城堡区。离这里有20 分钟的路程。\"\\n\\n 兰登皱着眉头问道：\"这么远啊？\"\\n\\n \"是啊。不过这正好可以让你有足够的时间来告诉我圣杯到底是什么。\"\\n\\n 兰登停了一下，说道：\"我会在提彬的住处告诉你的。他和我对圣杯的研究各有专攻，因此如果同时听我们两人讲，你会了解得更加全面。\"兰登微笑着继续说道：\"另外，圣杯就是提彬的命根子。他会把圣杯的故事讲得精彩无比，就像爱因斯坦讲相对论一样。\"\"希望雷不会介意我们在深夜拜访他。\"\\n\\n \"他可是正宗的\"雷爵士\"。\"兰登很清楚。\"提彬是个有个性的人。他是在写了一本详尽的约克家族史后被英国女王封为爵士的。\"索菲直视着他。\"你在开玩笑吧？我们要去拜访一位爵士？\"\\n\\n 兰登尴尬地笑了一下，说道：\"我们在寻找圣杯，索菲。还有谁能比一位爵士能为我们提供更多的帮助呢？\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8604.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
