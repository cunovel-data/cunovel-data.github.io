{"id":30191,"no":51,"title":"Chapter 50","content":"The unmarked Fiat sedan departing Castel Gandolfo snaked downward through the Alban Hillsinto the valley below. In the back seat, Bishop Aringarosa smiled, feeling the weight of the bearerbonds in the briefcase on his lap and wondering how long it would be before he and the Teachercould make the exchange.\\n\\n 　　Twenty million euro.\\n\\n 　　The sum would buy Aringarosa power far more valuable than that.\\n\\n 　　As his car sped back toward Rome, Aringarosa again found himself wondering why the Teacherhad not yet contacted him. Pulling his cell phone from his cassock pocket, he checked the carriersignal. Extremely faint.\\n\\n 　　\"Cell service is intermittent up here,\" the driver said, glancing at him in the rearview mirror. \"Inabout five minutes, we\u0027ll be out of the mountains, and service improves.\"\"Thank you.\" Aringarosa felt a sudden surge of concern. No service in the mountains? Maybe theTeacher had been trying to reach him all this time. Maybe something had gone terribly wrong.\\n\\n 　　Quickly, Aringarosa checked the phone\u0027s voice mail. Nothing. Then again, he realized, the Teachernever would have left a recorded message; he was a man who took enormous care with hiscommunications. Nobody understood better than the Teacher the perils of speaking openly in thismodern world. Electronic eavesdropping had played a major role in how he had gathered hisastonishing array of secret knowledge.\\n\\n 　　For this reason, he takes extra precautions.\\n\\n 　　Unfortunately, the Teacher\u0027s protocols for caution included a refusal to give Aringarosa any kind ofcontact number. I alone will initiate contact, the Teacher had informed him. So keep your phoneclose. Now that Aringarosa realized his phone might not have been working properly, he fearedwhat the Teacher might think if he had been repeatedly phoning with no answer.\\n\\n 　　He\u0027ll think something is wrong.\\n\\n 　　Or that I failed to get the bonds.\\n\\n 　　The bishop broke a light sweat.\\n\\n 　　Or worse... that I took the money and ran!\\n\\n 没有牌照的菲亚特轿车启程离开了岗道尔夫堡，沿着奥尔本山蜿蜒的盘山公路向山下行驶，进入了山谷。车后座上，阿林加洛沙主教面带微笑，琢磨着还要等多久才能和导师交易，他的膝盖可以感受到公文包里无记名支票的分量。\\n\\n 两千万欧元。\\n\\n 这笔钱能够为阿林加洛沙带来远比其本身更重要的权力。\\n\\n 在飞奔向罗马的车上，阿林加洛沙再次琢磨着为什么导师到现在还没有和他联络。于是他拿出手机来看，发现信号非常微弱。\\n\\n \"在这里，手机的信号总是断断续续的。\"司机从后视镜里瞥了他一眼说。\"再过五分钟，出了山区，信号就会好了。\"\"谢谢。\"阿林加洛沙突然担忧起来：山区没有信号？也许导师一直在试图联系他，也许出什么大乱子了。\\n\\n 阿林加洛沙迅速地检查了语音信箱，结果一无所获。他这才想起导师根本就不可能给他留下什么信息记录。导师是一个对通讯交流极为谨慎的人，他深谙在现代化社会中口无遮拦的危险性。他之所以能收集到令人惊讶的秘密信息，电子窃听功不可没。\\n\\n 因此，他总是格外警惕。\\n\\n 不幸的是，不留联系电话给阿林加洛沙正是导师的防范措施之一。我会主动联系你的，导师曾经告诉过他。所以把你的手机带在身边。当阿林加洛沙发现他的手机可能无法接通时，他真担心导师会误以为他一直不接听电话。\\n\\n 他可能会以为出了什么事。\\n\\n 也许会以为我没有弄到支票。\\n\\n 主教出了一身冷汗。\\n\\n 或许更糟……他可能认为我卷了钱跑了！\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8603.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
