{"id":30197,"no":57,"title":"Chapter 56","content":"Sophie stared at Teabing a long moment and then turned to Langdon. \"The Holy Grail is a person?\"Langdon nodded. \"A woman, in fact.\" From the blank look on Sophie\u0027s face, Langdon could tellthey had already lost her. He recalled having a similar reaction the first time he heard thestatement. It was not until he understood the symbology behind the Grail that the feminineconnection became clear.\n 　　Teabing apparently had a similar thought. \"Robert, perhaps this is the moment for the symbologistto clarify?\" He went to a nearby end table, found a piece of paper, and laid it in front of Langdon.\n 　　Langdon pulled a pen from his pocket. \"Sophie, are you familiar with the modern icons for maleand female?\" He drew the common male symbol mail and female symbol female.\n 　　\"Of course,\" she said.\n 　　\"These,\" he said quietly, \"are not the original symbols for male and female. Many peopleincorrectly assume the male symbol is derived from a shield and spear, while the female symbolrepresents a mirror reflecting beauty. In fact, the symbols originated as ancient astronomicalsymbols for the planet-god Mars and planet-goddess Venus. The original symbols are far simpler.\"Langdon drew another icon on the paper.\n 　　/\\\"This symbol is the original icon for male,\" he told her. \"A rudimentary phallus.\"\"Quite to the point,\" Sophie said.\n 　　\"As it were,\" Teabing added.\n 　　Langdon went on. \"This icon is formally known as the blade, and it represents aggression andmanhood. In fact, this exact phallus symbol is still used today on modern military uniforms todenote rank.\"\"Indeed.\" Teabing grinned. \"The more penises you have, the higher your rank. Boys will be boys.\"Langdon winced. \"Moving on, the female symbol, as you might imagine, is the exact opposite.\" Hedrew another symbol on the page. \"This is called the chalice.\"\\/Sophie glanced up, looking surprised.\n 　　Langdon could see she had made the connection. \"The chalice,\" he said, \"resembles a cup orvessel, and more important, it resembles the shape of a woman\u0027s womb. This symbolcommunicates femininity, womanhood, and fertility.\" Langdon looked directly at her now.\n 　　\"Sophie, legend tells us the Holy Grail is a chalice—a cup. But the Grail\u0027s description as a chaliceis actually an allegory to protect the true nature of the Holy Grail. That is to say, the legend usesthe chalice as a metaphor for something far more important.\"\"A woman,\" Sophie said.\n 　　\"Exactly.\" Langdon smiled. \"The Grail is literally the ancient symbol for womanhood, and theHoly Grail represents the sacred feminine and the goddess, which of course has now been lost,virtually eliminated by the Church. The power of the female and her ability to produce life wasonce very sacred, but it posed a threat to the rise of the predominantly male Church, and so thesacred feminine was demonized and called unclean. It was man, not God, who created the conceptof \u0027original sin,\u0027 whereby Eve tasted of the apple and caused the downfall of the human race.\n 　　Woman, once the sacred giver of life, was now the enemy.\"\"I should add,\" Teabing chimed, \"that this concept of woman as life-bringer was the foundation ofancient religion. Childbirth was mystical and powerful. Sadly, Christian philosophy decided toembezzle the female\u0027s creative power by ignoring biological truth and making man the Creator.\n 　　Genesis tells us that Eve was created from Adam\u0027s rib. Woman became an offshoot of man. And asinful one at that. Genesis was the beginning of the end for the goddess.\"\"The Grail,\" Langdon said, \"is symbolic of the lost goddess. When Christianity came along, the oldpagan religions did not die easily. Legends of chivalric quests for the lost Grail were in fact storiesof forbidden quests to find the lost sacred feminine. Knights who claimed to be \"searching for thechalice\" were speaking in code as a way to protect themselves from a Church that had subjugatedwomen, banished the Goddess, burned nonbelievers, and forbidden the pagan reverence for thesacred feminine.\"Sophie shook her head. \"I\u0027m sorry, when you said the Holy Grail was a person, I thought youmeant it was an actual person.\"\"It is,\" Langdon said.\n 　　\"And not just any person,\" Teabing blurted, clambering excitedly to his feet. \"A woman whocarried with her a secret so powerful that, if revealed, it threatened to devastate the very foundationof Christianity!\"Sophie looked overwhelmed. \"Is this woman well known in history?\"\"Quite.\" Teabing collected his crutches and motioned down the hall. \"And if we adjourn to thestudy, my friends, it would be my honor to show you Da Vinci\u0027s painting of her.\"Two rooms away, in the kitchen, manservant Rémy Legaludec stood in silence before a television.\n 　　The news station was broadcasting photos of a man and woman... the same two individuals towhom Rémy had just served tea.\n 索菲盯着提彬看了好一会儿，然后转身看着兰登问道：\"圣杯是个人吗？\"\n 兰登点点头。\"实际上是个女人。\"从索菲茫然的表情中，兰登知道她已经被弄得晕头转向了。他记得自己第一次听到这个说法时，也有这样的反应。直到明白了圣杯的象征意义，他才搞清了圣杯和女性之间的联系。\n 提彬显然也是这么想的。\"罗伯特，也许现在是你这位象征学专家把事情说明白的时候了。\"他走到桌子一头，找了一张纸，放在兰登面前。\n 兰登从口袋里拿出一支笔，说道：\"索菲，你熟悉代表女性和男性的图示吗？\"说着，他在纸上画了一个很常见的代表男性的图示含和一个代表女性的图示早。\n \"当然了。\"索菲说。\n 兰登平静地说道：\"可是这并不是最早代表男性和女性的图示。许多人都误认为这个代表男性的图示源于盾牌和长矛，而这个代表女性的图示则源于能照出她们美丽容貌的镜子。实际上这些标记源自古代天文学用来代表行星的男神马尔斯和女神维纳斯的标记。原来的标记更加简单。\"兰登在纸上又画了一个图示。\n ／＼他接着说道：\"这是最早代表男性的图示。男性生殖器的基本形状。\"\n 索菲说道：\"确实很像。\"\n 提彬补充道：\"原本如此。\"\n 兰登接着说道：\"这个图示的正式名称为\"刀刃\"，它代表着进攻和男子气。实际上，时至今日，这个图示还被用在军队的制服上来表示军衔。\"提彬笑着说道：\"确实如此。你的生殖器越多，军衔就越高。男人真是本性难移啊。\"\n 兰登不由得皱了一下眉头。\"让我们继续。可以想象，代表女性的标志方向完全相反。\n \"他在纸上又画了一个图示。\n ＼／\n \"这个叫做圣餐杯。\"\n 索菲抬头看着他，满脸惊讶。\n 兰登看出她已经开始联想了。他说道：\"圣餐杯就像一个酒杯或容器。但更重要的是，它还像妇女的子宫。\"兰登盯着她说道：\"索菲，根据传说，圣杯是一个圣餐杯，一个酒杯。\n 但是，这样的描述隐藏了圣杯的实质。也就是说，传说只是把圣杯作为一个重要事物的比喻。\"\"女人。\"索菲说道。\n 兰登微笑着说道：\"一点没错。杯子实际上是古代代表女性的标记。那么圣杯代表的就是神圣的女性和女神了。她现在已经消失得无影无踪，实际上是被教廷毁灭了。女性的力量和创造生命的能力非常神奇，而这对当时正在崛起的男性统治的罗马教廷构成了严重的威胁。于是他们就把神圣的女性说成是魔鬼，并说她们不圣洁。按照他们的说法，是男人而不是上帝创造了\"原罪\"，而夏娃则偷尝了禁果，招致了人类的堕落。一度被奉为神圣的生命创造者的女性现在成了敌人。\"提彬附和道：\"认为女性是生命缔造者的观点是很多古代宗教的基础。生育后代是件非常神奇而又充满了力量的事。然而，令人伤心的是，基督教的哲学决定通过忽略女性的生理特征来抹灭女性的创造力量，而把男性尊为\"创造者\"。《创世纪》告诉世人夏娃是用亚当的肋骨做成的。女人成了男人的衍生物，而且还是罪人。《创世纪》结束了对女神的崇拜。\"兰登说道：\"圣杯代表着失落的女神。当基督教产生时，所谓的邪教并没有轻易地消亡。关于骑士们寻找圣杯的传说实际上是关于寻找圣女的故事。那些宣称\"寻找圣杯\"的骑士是以此来掩盖真相，以免受到罗马教廷的迫害。当时的教廷欺压妇女，驱逐女神，烧死不信奉基督教的人，而且还禁止异教徒崇拜圣女。\"索菲摇摇头，说道：\"对不起，当您说圣杯是个人时，我还以为那是个真人呢。\"\n 兰登说道：\"是个真人。\"\n 提彬兴奋得站了起来，脱口而出：\"但并不是指所有人。那位特殊的女性携带着一个重大的秘密，一旦秘密泄露，将会动摇基督教的根基！\"索菲激动地问道：\"这位妇女在历史上很有名吗？\"\n \"非常有名。\"提彬拿起拐杖，向走廊走去：\"朋友们，到我的书房去继续讨论吧，我将很荣幸地给你们看一幅达。芬奇为她画的肖像。\"厨房里，男佣雷米。莱格鲁德一言不发地站在电视机前。新闻中正播放着一个男人和一个女人的照片……雷米刚刚为这两个人送过茶。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8609.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
