{"id":30188,"no":48,"title":"Chapter 47","content":"Riding inside the dimly lit cargo hold of the armored truck was like being transported inside a cellfor solitary confinement. Langdon fought the all too familiar anxiety that haunted him in confinedspaces. Vernet said he would take us a safe distance out of the city. Where? How far?\n 　　Langdon\u0027s legs had gotten stiff from sitting cross-legged on the metal floor, and he shifted hisposition, wincing to feel the blood pouring back into his lower body. In his arms, he still clutchedthe bizarre treasure they had extricated from the bank.\n 　　\"I think we\u0027re on the highway now,\" Sophie whispered.\n 　　Langdon sensed the same thing. The truck, after an unnerving pause atop the bank ramp, hadmoved on, snaking left and right for a minute or two, and was now accelerating to what felt like topspeed. Beneath them, the bulletproof tires hummed on smooth pavement. Forcing his attention tothe rosewood box in his arms, Langdon laid the precious bundle on the floor, unwrapped his jacket,and extracted the box, pulling it toward him. Sophie shifted her position so they were sitting sideby side. Langdon suddenly felt like they were two kids huddled over a Christmas present.\n 　　In contrast to the warm colors of the rosewood box, the inlaid rose had been crafted of a pale wood,probably ash, which shone clearly in the dim light. The Rose. Entire armies and religions had beenbuilt on this symbol, as had secret societies. The Rosicrucians. The Knights of the Rosy Cross.\n 　　\"Go ahead,\" Sophie said. \"Open it.\"Langdon took a deep breath. Reaching for the lid, he stole one more admiring glance at theintricate woodwork and then, unhooking the clasp, he opened the lid, revealing the object within.\n 　　Langdon had harbored several fantasies about what they might find inside this box, but clearly hehad been wrong on every account. Nestled snugly inside the box\u0027s heavily padded interior ofcrimson silk lay an object Langdon could not even begin to comprehend.\n 　　Crafted of polished white marble, it was a stone cylinder approximately the dimensions of a tennisball can. More complicated than a simple column of stone, however, the cylinder appeared to havebeen assembled in many pieces. Six doughnut-sized disks of marble had been stacked and affixedto one another within a delicate brass framework. It looked like some kind of tubular, multiwheeledkaleidoscope. Each end of the cylinder was affixed with an end cap, also marble, making itimpossible to see inside. Having heard liquid within, Langdon assumed the cylinder was hollow.\n 　　As mystifying as the construction of the cylinder was, however, it was the engravings around thetube\u0027s circumference that drew Langdon\u0027s primary focus. Each of the six disks had been carefullycarved with the same unlikely series of letters—the entire alphabet. The lettered cylinder remindedLangdon of one of his childhood toys—a rod threaded with lettered tumblers that could be rotatedto spell different words.\n 　　\"Amazing, isn\u0027t it?\" Sophie whispered.\n 　　Langdon glanced up. \"I don\u0027t know. What the hell is it?\"Now there was a glint in Sophie\u0027s eye. \"My grandfather used to craft these as a hobby. They wereinvented by Leonardo da Vinci.\"Even in the diffuse light, Sophie could see Langdon\u0027s surprise.\n 　　\"Da Vinci?\" he muttered, looking again at the canister.\n 　　\"Yes. It\u0027s called a cryptex. According to my grandfather, the blueprints come from one of DaVinci\u0027s secret diaries.\"\"What is it for?\"Considering tonight\u0027s events, Sophie knew the answer might have some interesting implications.\n 　　\"It\u0027s a vault,\" she said. \"For storing secret information.\"Langdon\u0027s eyes widened further.\n 　　Sophie explained that creating models of Da Vinci\u0027s inventions was one of her grandfather\u0027s best-loved hobbies. A talented craftsman who spent hours in his wood and metal shop, Jacques Saunièreenjoyed imitating master craftsmen—Fabergé, assorted cloisonne artisans, and the less artistic, butfar more practical, Leonardo da Vinci.\n 　　Even a cursory glance through Da Vinci\u0027s journals revealed why the luminary was as notorious forhis lack of follow-through as he was famous for his brilliance. Da Vinci had drawn up blueprintsfor hundreds of inventions he had never built. One of Jacques Saunière\u0027s favorite pastimes wasbringing Da Vinci\u0027s more obscure brainstorms to life—timepieces, water pumps, cryptexes, andeven a fully articulated model of a medieval French knight, which now stood proudly on the deskin his office. Designed by Da Vinci in 1495 as an outgrowth of his earliest anatomy andkinesiology studies, the internal mechanism of the robot knight possessed accurate joints andtendons, and was designed to sit up, wave its arms, and move its head via a flexible neck whileopening and closing an anatomically correct jaw. This armor-clad knight, Sophie had alwaysbelieved, was the most beautiful object her grandfather had ever built... that was, until she had seenthe cryptex in this rosewood box.\n 　　\"He made me one of these when I was little,\" Sophie said. \"But I\u0027ve never seen one so ornate andlarge.\"Langdon\u0027s eyes had never left the box. \"I\u0027ve never heard of a cryptex.\"Sophie was not surprised. Most of Leonardo\u0027s unbuilt inventions had never been studied or evennamed. The term cryptex possibly had been her grandfather\u0027s creation, an apt title for this devicethat used the science of cryptology to protect information written on the contained scroll or codex.\n 　　Da Vinci had been a cryptology pioneer, Sophie knew, although he was seldom given credit.\n 　　Sophie\u0027s university instructors, while presenting computer encryption methods for securing data,praised modern cryptologists like Zimmerman and Schneier but failed to mention that it wasLeonardo who had invented one of the first rudimentary forms of public key encryption centuriesago. Sophie\u0027s grandfather, of course, had been the one to tell her all about that.\n 　　As their armored truck roared down the highway, Sophie explained to Langdon that the cryptexhad been Da Vinci\u0027s solution to the dilemma of sending secure messages over long distances. In anera without telephones or e-mail, anyone wanting to convey private information to someone faraway had no option but to write it down and then trust a messenger to carry the letter.\n 　　Unfortunately, if a messenger suspected the letter might contain valuable information, he couldmake far more money selling the information to adversaries than he could delivering the letterproperly.\n 　　Many great minds in history had invented cryptologic solutions to the challenge of data protection:\n 　　Julius Caesar devised a code-writing scheme called the Caesar Box; Mary, Queen of Scots createda transposition cipher and sent secret communiqués from prison; and the brilliant Arab scientistAbu Yusuf Ismail al-Kindi protected his secrets with an ingeniously conceived polyalphabeticsubstitution cipher.\n 　　Da Vinci, however, eschewed mathematics and cryptology for a mechanical solution. The cryptex.\n 　　A portable container that could safeguard letters, maps, diagrams, anything at all. Once informationwas sealed inside the cryptex, only the individual with the proper password could access it.\n 　　\"We require a password,\" Sophie said, pointing out the lettered dials. \"A cryptex works much like abicycle\u0027s combination lock. If you align the dials in the proper position, the lock slides open. Thiscryptex has five lettered dials. When you rotate them to their proper sequence, the tumblers insidealign, and the entire cylinder slides apart.\"\"And inside?\"\"Once the cylinder slides apart, you have access to a hollow central compartment, which can hold ascroll of paper on which is the information you want to keep private.\"Langdon looked incredulous. \"And you say your grandfather built these for you when you wereyounger?\"\"Some smaller ones, yes. A couple times for my birthday, he gave me a cryptex and told me ariddle. The answer to the riddle was the password to the cryptex, and once I figured it out, I couldopen it up and find my birthday card.\"\"A lot of work for a card.\"\"No, the cards always contained another riddle or clue. My grandfather loved creating elaboratetreasure hunts around our house, a string of clues that eventually led to my real gift. Each treasurehunt was a test of character and merit, to ensure I earned my rewards. And the tests were neversimple.\"Langdon eyed the device again, still looking skeptical. \"But why not just pry it apart? Or smash it?\n 　　The metal looks delicate, and marble is a soft rock.\"Sophie smiled. \"Because Da Vinci is too smart for that. He designed the cryptex so that if you tryto force it open in any way, the information self-destructs. Watch.\" Sophie reached into the box andcarefully lifted out the cylinder. \"Any information to be inserted is first written on a papyrusscroll.\"\"Not vellum?\"Sophie shook her head. \"Papyrus. I know sheep\u0027s vellum was more durable and more common inthose days, but it had to be papyrus. The thinner the better.\"\"Okay.\"\"Before the papyrus was inserted into the cryptex\u0027s compartment, it was rolled around a delicateglass vial.\" She tipped the cryptex, and the liquid inside gurgled. \"A vial of liquid.\"\"Liquid what?\"Sophie smiled. \"Vinegar.\"Langdon hesitated a moment and then began nodding. \"Brilliant.\"Vinegar and papyrus, Sophie thought. If someone attempted to force open the cryptex, the glassvial would break, and the vinegar would quickly dissolve the papyrus. By the time anyoneextracted the secret message, it would be a glob of meaningless pulp.\n 　　\"As you can see,\" Sophie told him, \"the only way to access the information inside is to know theproper five-letter password. And with five dials, each with twenty-six letters, that\u0027s twenty-six tothe fifth power.\" She quickly estimated the permutations. \"Approximately twelve millionpossibilities.\"\"If you say so,\" Langdon said, looking like he had approximately twelve million questions runningthrough his head. \"What information do you think is inside?\"\"Whatever it is, my grandfather obviously wanted very badly to keep it secret.\" She paused, closingthe box lid and eyeing the five-petal Rose inlaid on it. Something was bothering her. \"Did you sayearlier that the Rose is a symbol for the Grail?\"\"Exactly. In Priory symbolism, the Rose and the Grail are synonymous.\"Sophie furrowed her brow. \"That\u0027s strange, because my grandfather always told me the Rose meantsecrecy. He used to hang a rose on his office door at home when he was having a confidentialphone call and didn\u0027t want me to disturb him. He encouraged me to do the same.\" Sweetie, hergrandfather said, rather than lock each other out, we can each hang a rose—la fleur dessecrets—on our door when we need privacy. This way we learn to respect and trust each other.\n 　　Hanging a rose is an ancient Roman custom.\n 　　\"Sub rosa,\" Langdon said. \"The Romans hung a rose over meetings to indicate the meeting wasconfidential. Attendees understood that whatever was said under the rose—or sub rosa—had toremain a secret.\"Langdon quickly explained that the Rose\u0027s overtone of secrecy was not the only reason the Prioryused it as a symbol for the Grail. Rosa rugosa, one of the oldest species of rose, had five petals andpentagonal symmetry, just like the guiding star of Venus, giving the Rose strong iconographic tiesto womanhood. In addition, the Rose had close ties to the concept of \"true direction\" andnavigating one\u0027s way. The Compass Rose helped travelers navigate, as did Rose Lines, thelongitudinal lines on maps. For this reason, the Rose was a symbol that spoke of the Grail on manylevels—secrecy, womanhood, and guidance—the feminine chalice and guiding star that led tosecret truth.\n 　　As Langdon finished his explanation, his expression seemed to tighten suddenly.\n 　　\"Robert? Are you okay?\"His eyes were riveted to the rosewood box. \"Sub... rosa,\" he choked, a fearful bewildermentsweeping across his face. \"It can\u0027t be.\"\"What?\"Langdon slowly raised his eyes. \"Under the sign of the Rose,\" he whispered. \"This cryptex... Ithink I know what it is.\"\n 坐在装甲车那光线昏暗的货舱里就像在小房间里关禁闭一样。兰登极力克制自己的焦急，这种感觉太熟悉了，每次他被关起来时，都会有这种感觉。韦尔内说要把我们送到一个远离城市的安全的地带。那是什么地方呢？有多远呀？\n 长时间盘腿而坐的姿势使兰登的双腿都僵硬了。他换了个姿势，疼得向后一仰，感觉血又重新流回到了下半身。他仍然紧紧抱着那个从银行里拯救出来的奇异宝贝。\n \"我想我们已经上了高速公路。\"索菲轻声说。\n 兰登也有同感。装甲车爬上银行的坡道后，停了老大一会儿，让人捏了一把汗。然后，车又左右迂回地前行了一两分钟，现在则好像在全速前进。防弹轮胎在乎坦的公路上转动，发出\"轰隆隆\"的声响。兰登又将注意力转到怀中的紫檀木盒子上。他把这宝贝盒子放在车厢地板上，打开包裹在外面的夹克衫，取出盒子，拉到自己面前。索菲转身，靠到他身边。兰登突然觉得他俩就像挤在一起看圣诞礼物的孩子。\n 与暖色调的紫檀木盒子不同，嵌在上面的玫瑰是用浅色的木头--可能是白腊木--刻成的。玫瑰在昏暗的灯光下清晰可辨。玫瑰。整个军队、宗教组织和秘密团体都是以它为基础建立起来的。蔷薇十字会员。玫瑰十字社的骑士。\n \"来啊，打开。\"索菲说。\n 兰登深吸了一口气，把手伸向盒盖，用欣赏的目光看了看精致的盒子，打开扣钩，掀开盖子。里面的东西露了出来。\n 兰登曾猜想过盒子里究竟是什么东西，可是现在看来，他原有的猜测都是错的。盒内厚厚的紫红色丝绸衬里上放着一个兰登根本就不认识的东西。\n 那是个光滑的白色大理石圆筒，有网球罐那么大，非常精致。它看上去远比普通的圆柱形石头复杂，因为它好像是由好几块小石头拼凑成的。一个精致的铜框里叠放着六个大理石圆盘，就像一个管状的万花筒、圆筒的两端也用大理石粘着，根本无法看到圆柱内部。因为听到过液体的声音，所以兰登推测这个圆筒应该是中空的。\n 圆筒不仅外形神秘，周围还雕刻着许多图案，这引起了兰登的极大兴趣。每个小圆盘上都雕刻着一系列精致的字母--这些字母组成了完整的字母表。这样的圆筒使兰登想起了儿时的一种玩具--一根木棍上穿着刻有字母的转筒，转筒一转，就能拼出不同的单词。\n \"不可思议，是吧？\"索菲小声问道。\n 兰登抬起头。\"我不知道这到底是个什么鬼东西。\"\n 索菲的眼睛闪闪发亮。\"祖父过去特别喜欢制作这种东西。它是由达。芬奇发明的。\"\n 即便在微弱的灯光下，索菲也能看到兰登脸上吃惊的表情。\n \"达。芬奇？\"他又瞅了瞅那个圆筒，喃喃地说。\n \"是的。这叫做密码筒。祖父说，这个东西的设计图来自于达。芬奇的秘密日记。\"\n \"这有什么用呢？\"\n 想起今晚发生的事情，索菲觉得自己的回答也许会包含一些有趣的暗示。\"这是个宝库，是用来保存秘密信息的。\"兰登把眼睛睁得更大了。\n 索菲解释说，祖父最大的爱好之一就是根据达。芬奇的发明制作模型。雅克。索尼埃是个很有天分的工匠，经常会在放满木料和金属的工作室里呆上半天。他喜爱模仿工匠大师--精通景泰蓝的各种制作工艺的费伯奇，和艺术感略逊一筹，但更注重实用性的列昂纳多。达。芬奇。\n 只要浏览一下达。芬奇的日记，就会明白为什么这个博学的人在以聪明睿智而闻名于世的同时，会因做事虎头蛇尾而名声狼藉。达。芬奇曾画了上千张设计图纸，但从来也没有把它们付诸实践。雅克。索尼埃的消遣之一就是把达。芬奇的突发奇想变成现实--他制作了时间机器、水泵、密码筒，甚至还做了一个完全用铰链连接的中世纪法国骑士的模型。那个模型骑士现在正骄傲地站在他办公室的桌上。这个模型是达。芬奇于1495 年设计的。它以达。芬奇早年对解剖学和运动机能学的研究为基础，因此这个模型人有非常准确的关节和肌腱机构。根据设计，这个模型人可以坐起来，并能挥动手臂，还能转动脖子，同时张开下巴。在没看见这个密码筒之前，索菲还以为那个穿着盔甲的骑士是祖父的最佳作品。\n \"我小时候，他就给我做过一个这样的东西。\"索菲说。\"只是没有这么大，这么精美。\"\n 兰登目不转睛地看着盒子：\"我从没听说过密码筒。\"\n 索菲完全可以理解他的反应。很少人研究达。芬奇那些纸上谈兵的发明，而且一些发明连名字都没有。\"密码筒\"这个名字可能也是祖父起的。这个名称还是很贴切的，因为这个装置是运用密码术来保存信息的。\n 虽然达。芬奇对密码学的研究鲜为人知，但索菲确信他确实是这方面的先锋人物。索菲的大学老师在演示电脑编写密码的方法时，曾高度赞扬了斯莫曼和史格涅尔等当代密码学家，但没有指出实际上是达。芬奇在几百年前就发明了最基本的公众密码的编写方法。当然，索菲的祖父早就跟她说过这些。\n 装甲车在公路上呼啸着疾驰。索菲解释道：\"密码筒是达。芬奇为长途运送秘密情报而设计的。在那个没有电话和电子邮件的时代，人们要想把私人信息传递给远方朋友的话，就只能把要说的话写下来然后拜托信使送去。然而，如果送信人知道信里有重要信息，为了能赚更多的钱，就会把这个消息卖给发信者的敌人。\"历史上有许多著名人物都曾尝试利用密码来保护信息。朱利亚斯。凯萨设计过一个叫做\"凯萨盒\"的密码保护工具；苏格兰女王马路亚创造过一种换位密码，成功地将秘密报告从监狱里送了出去；著名的阿拉伯科学家阿布曾运用字母替换密码保护他的秘密。\n 然而，达。芬奇却避开了数学和密码学而采用了\"机械\"的方法来保护信息。他发明了密码筒--一个可以保护信件、地图、图表等任何东西的便携容器。一旦把秘密放进这个密码筒，那么就只有知道密码的人才能将它取出。\n \"我们需要密码。\"索菲指着刻满字母的转盘说。\"密码筒的工作原理跟自行车上的号码锁一样。如果你把这些转盘上的字母正确地排成一行，锁就打开了。这个密码筒有五个转盘。把它们转到正确的位置，整个圆筒就会自动打开了。\"\"那么里面呢？\"\n \"圆筒一打开，你就能看到中间有个隔层，隔层里可以放下一卷纸，你可以把秘密写在上面。\"兰登不解地问道：\"你说你小时候祖父给你做过这些东西？\"\n \"是的，不过都比这个小。有几次是为了我的生日。他会给我一个密码筒，然后再让我猜一个谜语。谜底就是密码筒的密码。一旦我猜出谜底，就能打开密码筒找到生日卡片了。\"\"要找到生日卡片，还真得费一番功夫。\"\n \"不仅如此，卡片上总是写着另一个谜语或线索。祖父喜欢在房子周围精心地设计\"寻宝行动\"，提供一连串的线索让我去寻找真正的礼物。每次的寻宝行动都是对个性和品德的测试，以确保我有资格得到那个礼物，而且每次的测验都不简单。\"兰登转头用怀疑的眼神打量着这个装置。\"但是，为什么不把它撬开呢？或者干脆把它砸开？这金属看上去不算结实，大理石也不硬。\"索菲笑道：\"达。芬奇那么聪明，怎么会想不到这一点呢。如果你把它强行打开，里面的信息会自动销毁。看。\"索菲把手伸进盒子，小心翼翼地拿起那个圆筒。\"放进去的任何信息都要先写在一张草质纸卷上。\"\"不是羊皮纸？\"\n 索菲摇摇头。\"草质的纸张。我知道羊皮纸更耐用，而且在那个年代更普遍。但是必须得用草质的纸张，而且越薄越好。\"\"接着说。\"\n \"把草质纸张放进密码筒的隔层之前，得先把它绕在一个玻璃小瓶上。\"她敲了一下密码筒，筒里的液体汩汩作响。\"瓶里是液体。\"\n \"什么液体？\"\n 索菲笑道：\"醋。\"\n 兰登愣了一会儿，然后点头称赞：\"聪明。\"\n 醋和草质纸张，索菲想。如果有人强行打开密码器，就会弄破玻璃瓶，瓶里的醋就会迅速溶解草质纸张。等密码筒被打开的时候，那卷纸早已化作了一团纸浆。\n \"正如你所见。\"索菲说。\"得到秘密的唯一方法就是要知道一个正确的五位数密码。这上面有五个转盘，每个转盘上有26 个字母，那可能作为密码的数字就有26 的5 次方……\"她迅速地估算。\"约有1，200 万个。\"\n \"这么说来。\"兰登边说，边琢磨着那1，200 万种可能的排列。\"你认为里面藏着什么秘密呢？\"\n \"不管是什么，显然祖父非常想保守这个秘密。\"她合上盖子看着那朵五瓣玫瑰，突然愣住了。\"你刚才说这个玫瑰是圣杯的标志？\"\n \"一点没错。对隐修会来说，五瓣玫瑰就意味着圣杯。\"\n 索菲皱起眉头：\"那就太奇怪了，因为祖父一直对我说玫瑰代表着\"秘密\"。过去他在家里打秘密的电话，不想让我打搅时，总是在他办公室门上挂一朵玫瑰。他让我也学他这么做。祖父会说：\"宝贝，当我们需要独处的时候，与其把对方锁在门外，倒不如在自己的门上挂一朵代表秘密的玫瑰。这样我们就会学会尊重和信任对方。\"要知道，在门上挂玫瑰可是古罗马人的习俗哪。\"兰登说道：\"罗马人开会时在门上挂玫瑰表示会议需要保密。与会者明白凡是在挂玫瑰的会议上通报的内容都是机密的。\"兰登又继续解释说，玫瑰暗示着秘密并不是隐修会把它作为圣杯的标志的唯一原因。\n 一种最古老的玫瑰--五瓣玫瑰--呈对称的五边形，就像维纳斯女神指路的明星，这样玫瑰在形状上就与\"女性气质\"产生了关联。而且，玫瑰还代表了\"正确的方向\"。罗盘可以为旅客导航，而\"玫瑰线\"，也就是地图上的经线也可以帮助人们确定方位。因此，玫瑰从多个层面上代表着圣杯的特质--秘密、女性气质、指引方向--就像指引人们寻求真理的明星。\n 兰登说完，突然僵在了那里。\n \"罗伯特，你没事吧？\"\n 兰登死死地盯着紫檀木的盒子。\"五瓣玫瑰。\"他的喉咙突然哽住了，险上闪过一丝疑惑。\n \"这不可能。\"\n \"什么？\"\n 兰登慢慢抬起头，轻声说道：\"在玫瑰标记下面，这个密码筒……我想我知道了。\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8600.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
