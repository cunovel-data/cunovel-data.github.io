{"id":30165,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"Silas gazed upward at the Saint-Sulpice obelisk, taking in the length of the massive marble shaft.\n 　　His sinews felt taut with exhilaration. He glanced around the church one more time to make sure hewas alone. Then he knelt at the base of the structure, not out of reverence, but out of necessity.\n 　　The keystone is hidden beneath the Rose Line.\n 　　At the base of the Sulpice obelisk.\n 　　All the brothers had concurred.\n 　　On his knees now, Silas ran his hands across the stone floor. He saw no cracks or markings toindicate a movable tile, so he began rapping softly with his knuckles on the floor. Following thebrass line closer to the obelisk, he knocked on each tile adjacent to the brass line. Finally, one ofthem echoed strangely.\n 　　There\u0027s a hollow area beneath the floor!\n 　　Silas smiled. His victims had spoken the truth.\n 　　Standing, he searched the sanctuary for something with which to break the floor tile.\n 　　High above Silas, in the balcony, Sister Sandrine stifled a gasp. Her darkest fears had just beenconfirmed. This visitor was not who he seemed. The mysterious Opus Dei monk had come to Saint-Sulpice for another purpose.\n 　　A secret purpose.\n 　　You are not the only one with secrets, she thought.\n 　　Sister Sandrine Bieil was more than the keeper of this church. She was a sentry. And tonight, theancient wheels had been set in motion. The arrival of this stranger at the base of the obelisk was asignal from the brotherhood.\n 　　It was a silent call of distress.\n 塞拉斯抬头看着圣叙尔皮斯方尖碑，估量着巨大的大理石碑面的高度。他身上的肌肉因为兴奋绷得紧紧的。他再次环视了一下教堂，确认四周无人。然后，他跪倒在石碑的基座前。当然，这并非是出于尊敬，只是出于实际需要。\n 楔石藏在玫瑰线下。\n 在圣叙尔皮斯方尖碑的基座处。\n 所有隐修会的成员都这么说。\n 塞拉斯跪在地上，双手在石块铺就的地面上摸索着。他没有发现哪块地砖上有表明可以移动的裂纹或标记，于是就开始用指关节敲击地面。他沿着铜线敲击着方尖碑附近的每一块地砖，最后终于发现有一块地砖的回音与众不同。\n 地砖下是空的！\n 塞拉斯笑了起来，看来他杀的那几个人都说了实话。\n 他站起身来，在圣殿里寻找可以用来撬开地砖的东西。\n 桑德琳嬷嬷蹲在塞拉斯上方那高高的唱诗班站台上，屏住了呼吸。她最担心的事终于发生了。这个来访者的身份与他的表象不符。这个神秘的天主事工会的僧侣另有所图。\n 为了一个秘密的目的。\n 有秘密的又何止你一人呢，她想。\n 桑德琳嬷嬷不仅是这所教堂的看守人，还是一名卫士。今晚，那古老的隐修会机制又开始运行了。陌生人来到方尖碑的基座边是教友们发出的信号。\n 那是无声的痛苦呼唤。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8577.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
