But how could Langdon have known about the GPS dot?\"\"Sophie Neveu,\" Fache replied. \"She told him.\"\"What! Why?\"\"Damned good question, but I just heard a recording that confirms she tipped him off.\"Collet was speechless. What was Neveu thinking? Fache had proof that Sophie had interfered witha DCPJ sting operation? Sophie Neveu was not only going to be fired, she was also going to jail.\n 　　\"But, Captain... then where is Langdon now?\"\"Have any fire alarms gone off there?\"\"No, sir.\"\"And no one has come out under the Grand Gallery gate?\"\"No. We\u0027ve got a Louvre security officer on the gate. Just as you requested.\"\"Okay, Langdon must still be inside the Grand Gallery.\"\"Inside? But what is he doing?\"\"Is the Louvre security guard armed?\"\"Yes, sir. He\u0027s a senior warden.\"\"Send him in,\" Fache commanded. \"I can\u0027t get my men back to the perimeter for a few minutes,and I don\u0027t want Langdon breaking for an exit.\" Fache paused. \"And you\u0027d better tell the guardAgent Neveu is probably in there with him.\"\"Agent Neveu left, I thought.\"\"Did you actually see her leave?\"\"No, sir, but—\"\"Well, nobody on the perimeter saw her leave either. They only saw her go in.\"Collet was flabbergasted by Sophie Neveu\u0027s bravado. She\u0027s still inside the building?\n 　　\"Handle it,\" Fache ordered. \"I want Langdon and Neveu at gunpoint by the time I get back.\"As the Trailor truck drove off, Captain Fache rounded up his men. Robert Langdon had proven anelusive quarry tonight, and with Agent Neveu now helping him, he might be far harder to cornerthan expected.\n 　　Fache decided not to take any chances.\n 　　Hedging his bets, he ordered half of his men back to the Louvre perimeter. The other half he sent toguard the only location in Paris where Robert Langdon could find safe harbor.\n 科莱中尉坐在索尼埃的桌前，吃惊地将电话紧紧贴在耳朵上。我没有听错法希的话吧？\"一块肥皂？可是兰登是怎么会知道有全球定位系统跟踪器的？\"\n \"索菲。奈芙。\"法希说道。\"是索菲。奈芙告诉他的。\"\n \"什么？怎么会这样？\"\n \"他妈的，问得好，我刚刚听了一段电话录音，证实是索菲教唆的。\"\n 科莱惊讶得说不出话来。奈芙到底是怎么想的？法希已经掌握了她妨碍警务的证据，她不仅将被开除，而且将被投入监狱。\"警长……兰登现在在哪里呢？\"\n \"火警有没有响起过？\"\n \"没有，先生。\"\n \"没有人走出艺术大画廊的大门？\"\n \"没有。按您的吩咐，我们已经派了一个卢浮宫的保安人员守住大门。\"\n \"好的，那么兰登一定还在艺术大画廊里面。\"\n \"还在里面？可他在里面做什么呢？\"\n \"卢浮宫的保安人员有武器吗？\"\n \"有，先生。他是一名高级保卫人员。\"\n \"让他进来。\"法希命令道。\"我无法在几分钟之内将我的人调回来，我可不想让兰登夺路而逃。\"法希顿了顿，接着说。\"你最好告诉那个保卫人员，索菲。奈芙说不定正和兰登在一起。\"\"我想，奈芙警官已经走了。\"\n \"你确实看见她走了吗？\"\n \"没有，但是--\"\n \"也没有警卫看见她离开。他们只看见她走了进去。\"\n 科莱被虚张声势的索菲蒙住了。她还在卢浮宫里？\n \"你去办这件事。\"法希命令道。\"我希望回来的时候可以看到兰登和奈芙在枪口前。\"\n 拖挂卡车开走后，法希探长将手下人集合起来。今晚的事已经证明了兰登是个难以捉摸的追捕目标，现在他又得到了奈芙警官的帮助，追捕工作将比想像中困难得多。\n 法希决定一切行动要稳扎稳打。\n 他把赌注一分为二，将一半人派回卢浮宫把守出口，将另一半人派往兰登在巴黎可以找到的惟一的避风港。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8580.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
