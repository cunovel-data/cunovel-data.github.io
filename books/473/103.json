{"id":30243,"no":103,"title":"Chapter 102","content":"The mist had settled low on Kensington Gardens as Silas limped into a quiet hollow out of sight.\n 　　Kneeling on the wet grass, he could feel a warm stream of blood flowing from the bullet woundbelow his ribs. Still, he stared straight ahead.\n 　　The fog made it look like heaven here.\n 　　Raising his bloody hands to pray, he watched the raindrops caress his fingers, turning them whiteagain. As the droplets fell harder across his back and shoulders, he could feel his body disappearingbit by bit into the mist.\n 　　I am a ghost.\n 　　A breeze rustled past him, carrying the damp, earthy scent of new life. With every living cell in hisbroken body, Silas prayed. He prayed for forgiveness. He prayed for mercy. And, above all, heprayed for his mentor... Bishop Aringarosa... that the Lord would not take him before his time. Hehas so much work left to do.\n 　　The fog was swirling around him now, and Silas felt so light that he was sure the wisps wouldcarry him away. Closing his eyes, he said a final prayer.\n 　　From somewhere in the mist, the voice of Manuel Aringarosa whispered to him.\n 　　Our Lord is a good and merciful God.\n 　　Silas\u0027s pain at last began to fade, and he knew the bishop was right.\n 塞拉斯一瘸一拐地走进一个看不见的寂静空间里。这时薄雾已经在肯辛顿花园中弥漫开来。他跪在湿漉漉的草地上，感到有股热血正从他肋骨以下的伤口里流了出来。然而他还是坚定地望着前方。\n 雾，使这里似乎变成了天堂。\n 他举起沾满鲜血的双手祈祷，注视着雨滴抚摸着他的手指头。雨水使他的手都变白了。由于雨滴更加猛烈地落在他的后背与肩膀上，他觉得自己的身体正逐渐地融化到薄雾里去了。\n 我快变成鬼了！\n 一阵风从他身边吹过，沙沙作响，带来了潮湿的泥土的芬芳，这是孕育了新生命的芳香。塞拉斯拖着散了架的身子祈祷。他祈祷上帝能给他宽恕，祈祷上帝能给他怜悯。他尤其要为他的恩师--阿林加洛沙主教祈祷……他祈祷上帝不要过早让这位主教离开这个世界。还有许多事情，在等着他去做呢。\n 雾，此刻在他身边缭绕，塞拉斯感觉是那么的轻盈，以至于他相信这缕缕烟雾会把他带走。他闭上眼睛，做完了最后的祷告。\n 从雾中的某个地方，传来曼努埃尔。阿林加洛沙主教的低语。\n 我主是和蔼仁慈的上帝。\n 塞拉斯的痛苦终于慢慢地消失了，他知道这位主教说的是对的。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/100/8655.html","bookId":473,"book":{"id":473,"title":"The Da Vinci Code达芬奇密码","description":"简介： The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective fiction novel written by American author, Dan Brown.
