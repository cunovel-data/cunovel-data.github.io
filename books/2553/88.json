He had no doubt that the child\u0027s pedigree, despite all the challenges and smokescreens SimGen would throw up, eventually would elevate sims to the status of \"persons.\" That one change in designation would tumble SimGen and send the world\u0027s labor and financial markets into chaos. The simple realization that he\u0027d occupy a pivotal position in the eye of that oncoming storm would have made sleep difficult; knowing that a cadre of ruthless men were on the prowl, looking for him and Romy and Meerm to prevent that from happening made it impossible.\\n\\n Zero had departed late this afternoon after a protracted debate as to whether or not Kek should stay here for security. They finally decided against that. Zero was the only one who could control him. What if Kek decided he wanted to go outside? Who was going to stop him? If he were spotted, that would blow their cover. Better to keep all nonhumans away from Betsy\u0027s.\\n\\n After a light dinner, they\u0027d all turned in early. Romy was in the next bedroom down the hall, Meerm was on a cot in Betsy\u0027s bedroom, Tome and Kek were with Zero at his home, wherever that was, God was in His heaven, and not one damn thing seemed right with the world.\\n\\n He jumped as he heard the bedroom door open.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s only me.\" He recognized Romy\u0027s whisper. \"Didn\u0027t mean to frighten you.\"\\n\\n \"Just startled me,\" he said. Then she startled him even further him by slipping under the covers and huddling against him. \"Hold me, Patrick.\"\\n\\n \"Gladly.\"\\n\\n He wound his arms around her. She was wearing some sort of long T-shirt. He didn\u0027t know what she had on under it, if anything.\\n\\n \"No, I mean, just hold me,\" she said. \"Nothing more. I don\u0027t want to be alone tonight, Patrick. I need a friend.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s me,\" he sighed. He was about to add, Friend to the friendless, but bit it back. She was trembling, as if chilled. So he said, \"Tough day, huh.\"\\n\\n \"Believe it.\"\\n\\n \"Want to talk about it?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n And then she said, \"I feel lost, Patrick. I used to have some pretty hard and fast ideas about right and wrong, up and down, latitude and longitude, but now everything\u0027s been twisted out of shape. Like one of those computer programs that let you distort a photo or a famous painting, you know, push it and pull it this way and that until it bears only a passing resemblance to the original. That\u0027s how my world feels. That\u0027s how my life feels. That\u0027s howI feel. Like I don\u0027t even know myself anymore.\" A harsh little laugh. \"Not that I ever did.\"\\n\\n \"You loved him, didn\u0027t you.\"\\n\\n He heard a soft sob and felt her head nod against his shoulder.\\n\\n \"Do you still?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she whispered. \"I think I was in love with an image I\u0027d concocted. But now that the mask is off...\"\\n\\n \"Let me ask you something,\" Patrick said. \"If he\u0027d taken off the mask and revealed a face horribly disfigured by birth defects or an accident, how would that have changed things?\"\\n\\n He marveled at the way his thoughts were running. He should have been searching for the best angle to wedge himself between Romy and Zero; instead he was looking for a way to ease her pain. As much as he wanted her - and right now, with her bare legs warm against his, that was very, very much - comforting her seemed even more important.\\n\\n \"Not at all. It wasn\u0027t a physical attraction. I see where you\u0027re going, but it\u0027s not the same. A disfigured man would still be a man. Zero isn\u0027t...\"\\n\\n \"A man? What\u0027s your definition of a man, Romy?\"\\n\\n \"A maleHomo sapiens .\"\\n\\n Patrick sensed himself clicking into attorney mode, felt the well-oiled teeth of his rhetoric and advocacy gears meshing. He\u0027d always prided himself on an ability to mount a convincing argument for either side of an issue, even one he didn\u0027t particularly care for. Like this one.\\n\\n \"But before today, when you thought of both Zero and me as maleHomo saps , you gravitated more toward him than me. Why?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know you, Patrick. And I didn\u0027t trust you. At least not at first. But you\u0027ve got to admit you\u0027ve changed.\"\\n\\n \"How?\"\\n\\n \"Well...,\" she said, drawing out the word, \"you\u0027ve gone from a man with no commitments to one who believes in something and is willing to put himself on the line for it.\"\\n\\n \"Romy, Zero has been committed since day one, from the roots of his hair down to his toenails, and that was what you responded to. But it went beyond commitment, didn\u0027t it. He demonstrated high intelligence, integrity, decency, courage, dignity, a reverence for life that matches, maybe even exceeds, your own. Those are traits you admire in humans. They\u0027re what make you value a human, and until this morning you\u0027d thought you could find them only in a human. But this is a new world, Romy, where the definition of \u0027human\u0027 is being revised - and let me tell you, when we take Meerm\u0027s baby public, it\u0027s going to undergo a total rewrite.\"\\n\\n Listen to me, Patrick thought. I\u0027m making his case and killing my own.\\n\\n But he was on a roll, high on his rhetorical momentum, and couldn\u0027t stop himself.\\n\\n \"As for Zero, he says he\u0027s a mutated sim. Well, it looks to me like he mutated in theHomo sapiens direction, big time. He\u0027s more human than a lot ofHomo saps I know, and we both knowHomo saps who look more apelike than he does. Meerm\u0027s baby is going to upgrade the sims from \u0027product\u0027 to \u0027person,\u0027 from the Pongidae family to Hominidae, but as far as I can see, Zero is already there. A new species of Hominidae - Homo zero. So what else do you want from the guy? What else does he have to do to deserve you?\"\\n\\n He felt her stiffen. \"It\u0027s not about deserving me. I\u0027d never - \"\\n\\n \"Then decide what makes a guy worthy of your love - his genome or his values.\"\\n\\n A long silence. Patrick had run out of steam, and Romy...he wished he knew what she was thinking.\\n\\n Then she snuggled closer. \"Thank you, Patrick. That doesn\u0027t settle things, but it helps. Helps a lot. You\u0027re a good friend.\"\\n\\n Good friend...he wished he were much more, but for now he\u0027d settle for that. Didn\u0027t have much choice. And who knew? Maybe things wouldn\u0027t work out between Zero and her. They\u0027d barely spoken today. Maybe Zero had other plans. But even if they both agreed on trying a relationship, they had a hell of a lot stacked against them.\\n\\n He\u0027d wait, because he knew of no other woman in the world like Romy Cadman. He\u0027d hang around so he could be close by to catch her if she fell. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-88.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) \\n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \\n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \\n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \\n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
