{"id":111810,"no":53,"title":"Page 53","content":"Luca Portero went directly from the CEO\u0027s office to the parking lot where he picked up one of the SimGen Jeeps. He grinned as he drove out the gate. A million-dollar reward - and Sinclair thinks it was his idea. Doesn\u0027t have a clue that I steered him into the whole thing. The meeting had been a thing of beauty, he had to admit. Knowing Sinclair-1\u0027s obsession with SimGen\u0027s public image, Luca had simply parceled out the information - first playing dumb about the xenografts, then mentioning an unaccounted-for sim, then hinting that she might be a witness - letting Sinclair pounce from one to the next like a mouse following a trail of cheese bits, until he\u0027d ended up right where Luca wanted him. A reward! Put SimGen in the news: The corporation with a heart as big as its market cap value! Putty in my hands, Luca thought. His grin faded as he thought about what lay ahead. Another meeting. This one with Darryl Lister. He and his old CO hadn\u0027t had a face-to-face in almost a year, which could only mean that the subject was as delicate as it was important. That made him uneasy. Worse yet, they were meeting at Luca\u0027s house. He pulled up the long drive to the rented two-bedroom cabin in the center of five acres of dense woods. He liked the isolation. This was his retreat from SimGen and lost sims. Lister wasn\u0027t due for another half hour. Still plenty of time to get Maria out of the way and - He hit the brakes when he saw the black Mercedes SUV parked in front of the house. Lister? Shit! He still had time to salvage this. Was Lister alone? With the late morning sun glinting off the SUV\u0027s windshield, Luca couldn\u0027t tell how many were in the car. When he pulled up next to it he was startled to see that it was empty. He hurried through his front door and found Darryl Lister sitting on the couch, sipping a beer. Maria stood behind him, rubbing her hands together, her dark eyes wide with anxiety. Luca stared at Lister. This plump country squire type was miles away from the hardbodied CO who\u0027d parachuted with him onto the Shahi Kot mountains. He was a pogue now, in his late forties, and the brown corduroys and bulky white Irish wool sweater he wore couldn\u0027t hide the inches he\u0027d been adding to his waist. And judging from the new gelled-up style of his light brown hair, it looked like he\u0027d started going to a fag barber. The man was becoming a stranger. \"Luca.\" He rose and smiled as he extended his hand. \"I was going to wait in the car, but then this sweet young thing surprised the hell out of me by opening the front door. I invited myself in.\" As they shook hands, his smile faded. \"Who is she, Portero? I know you don\u0027t have any kids. A niece?\" \"No one you have to worry about.\" \"You know the rules.\" Luca held up the car keys.\"Maria, esperame en el auto.\" She scurried around the couch. Her jeans and bulky flannel shirt couldn\u0027t hide her ripe young figure as she grabbed the keys and ran out the door. Luca noticed Lister\u0027s eyes following her all the way. \"Nice,\" he said. \"What is she? Sixteen?\" Luca felt invaded. He wanted to tell Lister it was none of his fucking business, but bit it back. To a very real extent, itwas Lister\u0027s business. \"She\u0027s old enough,\" Luca said. Maria had told him she was eighteen, but she might be even younger. He\u0027d seen her begging on an East Village sidewalk last summer. Maybe it was her flat peasant face, or the desperation in her black eyes...something about her spurred an impulse from a nameless place to shove a couple of singles into her hand. He heard her soft, \"Gracias, senor,\" saw the sudden faraway look in her eyes as she clutched the bills between her breasts like a family heirloom, and he had to speak to her. Good thing he knew Spanish because she didn\u0027t know anything else. He bought her lunch, took her to a Spanish film at the Angelika, bought her dinner, then brought her home. She\u0027d been living here ever since. She cleaned his house, cooked his food, kept his bed warm at night, and thought she\u0027d found heaven. \"She\u0027s an illegal who\u0027s young enough to be your daughter, right?\" True on both counts, but so what? \"Don\u0027t worry. She doesn\u0027t know anything. Can\u0027t speak a word of English.\" \"But Iam worried. It\u0027s against the rules. You\u0027re supposed to be a model citizen. A clean nose, no legal hassles. That\u0027s the deal when you come in. You agreed, now look at you: shacking up with a barely legal illegal.\" \"No one\u0027s going to know. Not way out here.\" \"Butour people will know. Sooner or later you know they\u0027ll find out. And they won\u0027t like it. And since I sponsored you, that will reflect on me.\" \"Look - \" \"They\u0027ve already got questions about you. Like why you don\u0027t seem to own anything. You rent this place and...\" He looked around with distaste. \"And it looks like you furnish it from secondhand stores.\" \"It came with the territory. It\u0027s a furnished rental.\" \"I know we pay you enough to afford to buy.\" Of course they did. But Luca saw no point in tying up money in real estate. He wanted no anchors. When the time came to move on, as it inevitably would, he wanted to be able to pick up and go without a second\u0027s hesitation, without a single look back. \"It\u0027s the way I\u0027ve always lived.\" \"I know. I\u0027ve tried to explain that to them. They don\u0027t care. They want you settled in. I went out on a limb to get you this cushy assignment, but if you don\u0027t put down some roots, they\u0027ll transfer you out to Idaho. And I\u0027ll have egg on my face.\" Luca had spent a few months at the Idaho facility and had no desire to go back. He held up his hands in surrender. \"Message received. I\u0027ll see what I can do about buying this place.\" \"Luca,\" Lister said, smiling as he put a hand on his shoulder. He rarely called him by his first name. \"You\u0027re making good money. And you\u0027ll be making better and better money. Enjoy it, for Christ\u0027s sake. That\u0027s what it\u0027s for. You can\u0027t take it with you.\" Luca nodded. \"I guess you\u0027re right.\" But he was thinking, Youcan take it with you - if you\u0027ve got it squirreled away in a secret offshore account. Luca believed in being prepared. He\u0027d learned that from his mother. She might have been a whore, but she was no dummy. She always kept a roll of cash hidden away for what she called \"the rainy days,\" when the cops periodically would raid her place and roust her out. The cash had always kept her out of jail. The same held true here. Who knew when the weather would change? He could handle the proverbial rainy day, but SIRG played rough, and if a shitstorm struck, he believed in having a safe harbor to hole up in. His was in Hamilton, Bermuda. He repressed a shudder. If SIRG ever found out about that account... \"But that\u0027s only half the reason for this face-to-face,\" Lister said. \"If it\u0027s about the missing sim,\" Lucas blurted, relieved to be moving away from his personal life, \"I just enlisted Mercer Sinclair\u0027s help - a million-dollar reward.\" Lister was looking at him. \"So you told him?\" \"Not yet. Not till I find the sim. I\u0027ve got people combing the city, visiting any place that uses sim labor. This reward will flush out anyone who\u0027s seen her. Once I have her, the Sinclairs can take over.\" Lister frowned. \"You might have had this sewn up by now if they\u0027d been on board from the start.\" \"They\u0027d have added nothing but panic.\" Bad enough to have Lister calling twice a day, he didn\u0027t need the Sinclairs yammering in his ear every free minute too. \"And don\u0027t forget, it took days for the fire department to sift through all the rubble. Until they reported no sim remains, we didn\u0027t know for sure she was missing.\" \"Still, if this million-dollar reward had been announced days ago...\" \"You know my problem with telling SimGen too much.\" \"This \u0027leak\u0027 you suspect?\" Luca nodded. Lister shoved his hands in his pockets and looked around. \"I thought you were way off base with that at first. Now I\u0027m not so sure.\" \"Why? What\u0027s happened?\" \"The Manassas attorneys met with the Cadman woman and Sullivan. What a farce. She could have walked away with millions but she\u0027s asking forbillions in damages.\" Luca wanted to laugh. He\u0027d known they couldn\u0027t buy off Romy Cadman. Just hearing her name set off reactions within him, part anger, part lust. Sometimes when he was with Maria, moving inside her, he thought of Romy Cadman. Young stuff like Maria pushed his buttons,all his buttons, but that didn\u0027t mean he didn\u0027t have anything left over for a prime piece of mature tail like Cadman. \"Did you agree to pay it?\" Lister stared at him. \"You\u0027re not serious.\" \"You should have called their bluff, just to see what they\u0027d do. Because we all know they\u0027re not after money. But what does this have to do with a leak?\" \"The Cadman woman said she\u0027d come to the Manassas office because she wanted to know why a truck leased in Idaho by Manassas was driving around the SimGen campus.\" \"But...\" Luca\u0027s heart stalled, then picked up again. \"But there\u0027s no connection. Those leases are paid through Golden\u0027s credit card.\" Hal Golden was dead, but no one knew that. His body lay six feet deep in a field in Thailand, but his credit record, active and pristine, lived on in the computers of the finance world. Golden had never even heard of Manassas Ventures while he lived, so how had Cadman and Sullivan linked him to the company? \"I know that. But at one time Manassas leased them directly. Somehow she made the connection. And I\u0027m beginning to wonder if she might have been tipped.\" \"But that doesn\u0027t make sense. If someone\u0027s leaking her information about Manassas Ventures, wouldn\u0027t they tell her everything?\" \"You\u0027d think so, wouldn\u0027t you. But whatever her source, somehow this woman has identified Manassas as the tie between SimGen and our Idaho facility.\" \"So then, why not just abandon Manassas? It served its purpose.\" \"It\u0027s not like some dinghy you can cut loose at sea and forget. It\u0027s part of a chain of subsidiary corporate entities that this Sullivan fuck has already traced back four or five levels. This haseveryone upset.\" The way Lister emphasized \"everyone\" made it clear to Luca that this went far up the SIRG ladder. \"They want the woman and the lawyer stopped,\" Lister added, staring at him. \"And since you were in charge of the Cadman woman when she saw the truck with the Idaho plates, that puts this square in your lap. They want you to take care of it.\" \"What? Take her out? If anything happens to her, anythingfinal , Manassas Ventures will be a prime suspect.\" \"I\u0027m talking aboutinformation , not termination. She\u0027s obviously not alone in this. They want to know who\u0027s behind her. They want her source. And if there\u0027s a leak in SimGen, they want to know who it is. Word has come down: This has equal priority with the missing sim. Understand me, Luca? This isn\u0027t me talking to you.\" Lister suddenly looked uncomfortable. \"This comes from the Old Man himself.\" The Old Man? Luca swallowed. That meant this wentall the way up the ladder, and all eyes would be on him. Damn Romy Cadman for mentioning that truck. It almost seemed like she was doing everything in her power to screw him. \"Word is he\u0027s raising hell how if you\u0027d done the job right the first time, when you rolled Sullivan\u0027s car off the Saw Mill, we wouldn\u0027t be facing this now.\" Luca felt sick. \"Jesus...\" \"I went to bat for you, sent the Old Man your record in Operation Anaconda and the Baghdad sorties, and apparently that carried some weight. You know, soldier to soldier. He\u0027s giving you a chance to redeem yourself. That doesn\u0027t happen too often.\" \"I\u0027m grateful,\" he said, forcing the words past stiff lips. Luca felt a growing pressure in his head. Was someone out to get him...dump more on him than any one man could handle, then wait for him to buckle under the weight? \"I\u0027ll help you with the logistics and anything else I can,\" Lister told him. He looked fidgety now. Maybe Luca wasn\u0027t the only one being given a second chance. \"We\u0027vegot to know who she\u0027s fronting for.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Got to run.\" Luca followed him outside to the cars. He waved to Maria and jerked his thumb over his shoulder toward the open front door. She jumped out of the Jeep and ran back into the house. Again, Lister\u0027s eyes followed her. \"Remember what I said about putting down roots.\" \"Roger that,\" Luca said. But not till he saw how all this settled out. Until then he wanted that Bermuda account as fat as possible. \"And ditch the kid. Put her back where you found her.\" \"Will do.\" Lister smiled. \"Or marry her.\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" He\u0027d miss Maria, miss her a lot. She loved sex, cooked up a storm, and was crazy about him, would doanything for him. Maybe he\u0027d keep her around till he found a replacement. Someone who could - Luca\u0027s PCA chirped. He flipped it open and turned away from Lister as he spoke. \"Yes.\" \"This is Grimes. We found her. She\u0027s been hiding out in a sim crib.\" Relief flooded through him. \"You have her?\" \"Not yet. But we\u0027ve got an address and we\u0027re on our way.\" \"Where\u0027s the crib?\" Luca listened as Grimes read off a Newark address. \"I\u0027ll meet you there.\" He ended the call and turned back to Lister. \"One of my men. We\u0027ve located the missing sim. We\u0027re on our way to pick her up.\" He grinned at Lister. \"One problem down, one more to go.\" \"Let\u0027s hope so,\" Lister said. Luca jumped into the Jeep. Newark. Not a long drive. And the timing could not be better. Tying this up would free him up to devote all his energies to Romy Cadman, and settling with her once and for all.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-53.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result?
