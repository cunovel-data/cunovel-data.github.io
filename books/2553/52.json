Portero had personally delivered the police reports on the sim massacre in Brooklyn, an unusual courtesy. Perhaps the man was coming around, learning to be a team player.\n Who am I kidding? Someone like Harry Carstairs is a team player, but not Portero. He doesn\u0027t know the meaning of the word \"team.\" Mercer smiled to himself. Come to think of it, neither do I.\n This visit meant one thing: Portero wanted something.\n He\u0027d never come right out and ask, Mercer knew. He\u0027d use an oblique approach, try to sneak it in when no one was looking. Mercer was sure he\u0027d find out what it was before the meeting ended.\n \"I thought you\u0027d be upset,\" Portero said.\n Is that why he came? To watch me blow my top? Sorry, Little Luca. Not today.\n \"I am. I hate the idea of losing a dozen of our sims. That\u0027s something people seem to forget - they\u0027reour sims. No matter what country they\u0027re shipped to, even if it\u0027s the other side of the world, they still belong to SimGen. We can barely keep up with demand as it is, so of course I hate to lose even one.\"\n \"But you seem almost...happy.\"\n \"I\u0027m happy that these SLA creeps have been exposed for what they are. Yesterday\u0027s discovery shows they\u0027re not pro-sim activists, they\u0027re murderous organleggers.\" He glanced at the police report again. \"They\u0027re sure these are the same sims that were hijacked from the globulin farm?\"\n Portero nodded. \"Absolutely. Lucky thing NYPD was able to resuscitate that memory chip from the Bronx. And lucky too these globulin farmers were excellent record keepers: They scanned the neck bar codes of all their \u0027cows\u0027 into their computers.\"\n \"Then that nails the SLA. When they\u0027re caught they\u0027ll go down for murder and illegal organ trafficking. Any chance of tracing those organs?\"\n Portero shrugged. \"Unlikely. They were probably shipped overseas while still warm. I\u0027ve heard the Third World black market in transplant organs is booming, but...\" He looked troubled.\n \"But what?\"\n \"I know there\u0027s a big demand for human organs, but sim organs?\"\n \"They\u0027re called xenografts - nonhuman organs. Human bodies used to reject them almost immediately, but with the new treatments that remove his to compatibility antigens, the rejection rate is about equal to human allografts. Those hearts, livers, and kidneys are worth a fortune on the black market.\"\n Portero nodded and Mercer thought, You haven\u0027t a clue as to anything I just said.\n \"Hearts, livers, kidneys,\" Portero said. \"What about uteruses and ovaries? Are they transplantable?\"\n \"No value at all. Nor are the testicles they cut off - unless someone\u0027s developed a taste for a new kind of Rocky Mountain oyster.\"\n Just the thought made Mercer ill.\n \"Then why go to the trouble to harvest them?\"\n \"Maybe they were stupid organleggers.\"\n \"One other thing concerns me,\" Portero said. \"The chip from the globulin farm shows records of thirteen sims housed there right up until the night of the fire. But only twelve were found in that Brooklyn basement.\"\n \"You\u0027re sure?\"\n \"We know from the records that a female sim is unaccounted for. The only reason I can imagine why she wasn\u0027t butchered along with the rest is that she wasn\u0027t with them.\"\n \"You think she escaped?\"\n \"I suspect she was never captured. I think she fled the raid and the fire, and is hiding somewhere in the city.\"\n \"Why on earth would she hide?\"\n \"Maybe she saw the security man murdered and she\u0027s frightened. She could be anywhere, too terrified to show herself.\"\n A witness, Mercer thought. A sim could never testify in court, but this one might be able to provide the police with a lead or two.\n Mercer glanced down at the embedded monitor in his desktop. Damn near every headline scrolling up the screen this morning seemed to be about the sim slaughter in Brooklyn. The good part was that the phony \"SLA\" had shown its true colors; the bad part was the depiction of sims as helpless victims, easy prey for human scum. Too high a sympathy factor there. He needed to counter that, and this missing sim offered a unique opportunity.\n \"I want that sim found,\" he told Portero. \"To make sure she is, SimGen is going to offer a million- dollar reward to whoever finds her.\"\n Portero looked dubious. \"Do you think that\u0027s necessary? I\u0027m sure my people - \"\n \"Forget your people. This is strictly a SimGen matter. We\u0027ll handle it.\"\n Yes. The more he thought about this, the more he liked it. Here was a way to take back the headlines and reassert SimGen as the true champion and defender of sims.\n \"Very well,\" Portero said, rising. \"Since there\u0027s nothing for me to do in that regard, I\u0027ll get back to my office.\"\n After Portero was gone it occurred to Mercer that he hadn\u0027t discovered the reason for the security chief\u0027s personal visit. He\u0027d been sure he\u0027d wanted something. But what?\n Well, whatever it was, he hadn\u0027t got it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-52.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: \n Sims (Sims complete) \n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
