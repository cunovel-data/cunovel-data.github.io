{"id":111860,"no":109,"title":"Page 109","content":"This was a different Mercer Sinclair than the one Romy had seen at the shareholders\u0027 meeting. The suave good looks, the debonair poise were gone. This man looked haggard, years older. But he hadn\u0027t lost any of his fight. \"As usual, Ellis, you want to give up. You always were a quitter. But I\u0027mnot giving up. Not by a long shot. We can win, and I can tell you how. But I\u0027m not discussing it before outsiders - certainly not with someone here from OPRR.\" \"I\u0027m not representing OPRR today,\" Romy told him, \"but I\u0027ll leave if - \" \"No,\" Ellis said. \"We all stay. We all have a stake in this.\" Romy looked around, realizing how true that was. Ellis had led them all to the CEO\u0027s office - Romy, Patrick, Zero, and Tome and Kek as well. The last three had the most at stake. \"Then this meeting is over,\" said Mercer Sinclair. \"When you come to your - \" Abruptly the door opened and Luca Portero swaggered in. The pistol in his hand startled Romy, and the wild look in his eyes terrified her. \"Hail, hail, the gang\u0027s all here,\" he said, breaking into a sharklike grin. \"And a motley crew if I ever saw one,\" he said. \"Four humans, a sim, a - holy shit! Sothat\u0027s how you took down four of my men! Where\u0027d you get the mandrilla? I never would\u0027ve - \" His cold gaze settled on Zero. \"And who or what the fuck are you?\" \"They were just leaving, Portero,\" Mercer Sinclair said quickly. \"And so are you.\" \"Am I?\" \"Yes. You\u0027re fired. As of this minute you are no longer employed at SimGen.\" \"You talk to me like that?\" Portero said. \"Where do you get the balls to use that tone of voice with me after what you did?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You stood there time after time and looked down your nose at me and pretended to be horrified at what you called my \u0027methods,\u0027 when all the while you built this company by turning humans into monkeys and telling the world it was the other way around. You can\u0027t fire me, you piece of shit. I\u0027m firingyou !\" And before Romy knew it, Portero\u0027s pistol was leveled at Mercer Sinclair\u0027s chest. He fired twice, two rapid, booming reports, hitting him in the chest. Images strobe-flashed through Romy\u0027s shocked brain - Sinclair\u0027s eyes bulging - his mouth forming an astonished O - his backward tumble with outflung arms - the window behind him cracking as it was splattered with red. And then Portero was swinging his pistol in her direction. Patrick and Zero stood frozen to her right, Ellis was lunging toward his fallen brother. Portero shifted his pistol toward him, then seemed to change his mind. \"Later,\" he said softly, then focused on Romy. Kek growled and started forward. \"Kree-gah!\" Portero said and Kek froze. Portero smiled as he eyed Kek. \"Before being assigned here I worked with some of these mandrillas in our Idaho facility. They\u0027re conditioned from birth to stop whatever they\u0027re doing when they hear that word, then wait for another command - from the person who said it. I\u0027m told the word is ape talk from the Tarzan books.\" His gaze returned to Romy. \"Pretty cool, huh?\" He heaved a theatrical sigh. \"And now it\u0027s your turn, Ms. Romy Cadman. You\u0027ve messed up my future, so now it\u0027s only fair I mess up yours.\" Out of the corner of her right eye she saw Zero take a step closer to her, saying, \"Leave her alone!\" \"Hey, listen!\" Portero snarled. \"I don\u0027t know what kind of a freak you are, but another step and you\u0027re a dead freak. Got that?\" Kek growled again and Portero yelled, \"Kree-gah\" a second time. \"Don\u0027t make me shoot you, boy,\" he told Kek. \"I\u0027ve got plans for you.\" \"What plans can you possibly have for Kek?\" Romy said, hoping she could get him talking, maybe long enough for help to arrive, if any was coming. \"I may need a diversion at the airport. I\u0027ll just set him to tearing things up in another part of the terminal after I get there.\" He raised the pistol, centering it on Romy\u0027s chest. \"But enough idle chatter. Good-bye Romy Cadman.\" Romy felt a stunning impact against her right shoulder as, once again, two booming reports split the air. She saw the muzzle flashes as she fell to her left and realized that Zero had hurled himself against her. No! She heard Kek\u0027s enraged howl as he launched himself through the air, saw Portero try to bring his pistol to bear on the hurtling creature but he wasn\u0027t fast enough, heard him shout \"Kree-gah! Kree- gah!\" but no amount of conditioning was going to keep Kek from anyone who hurt Zero. Portero went down with screams of pain and terror. Zero! Romy rolled and was on her feet in a heartbeat, but Zero was down, slumped on his side, his life running out of him front and back into two red puddles. Romy swims into Zero\u0027s vision. Joy bursts within his ruined chest at the sight of her alive and unharmed. Her pale, strained face is framed in scintillating fog as she leans over him and wails for someone to call for help. Too late. Even though he feels no pain, or perhaps because he feels no pain, Zero knows he\u0027s dying. The impact of the bullets tearing though his chest was agonizing, but now...now he feels feather light and completely at peace. He stares at Romy\u0027s tear-stained face as she calls his name again and again, begging him to hang on. But he has no strength to hang on. He tries to move his lips but they won\u0027t respond. They must! He has to tell her that it\u0027s better this way. If this morning had gone differently...if Betsy hadn\u0027t confided to him her suspicions about Meerm\u0027s baby, and if Ellis hadn\u0027t confirmed them, his outlook would have been so different. He could have lived with the belief that he was an intellectual improvement on a nonhuman creature, could have held his head high as the best of his breed that aspired to the next evolutionary step. But the truth changed all that. He is not a step up from anything. He\u0027s an adulterated...thing...a freak of science. He doesn\u0027t know how long he could have survived knowing that he was cheated of his humanity. He feels her hand in his. He wills his fingers to move, and they do, they close on hers. She bursts into sobs. He wants to tell her how he\u0027s loved her. And how, thinking he was a sim, he could have been satisfied to go on loving her from afar. But he doesn\u0027t know how he could bear seeing her and being with her, and ever dreaming about what, but for the violation of a few genes, might have been. It\u0027s better this way. The opening in the glittering cloud encircling Romy\u0027s face begins to narrow, brightening as she seems to recede. A sob builds in what\u0027s left of his chest. Not yet. Let me look at her a little longer. But the cloud brightens further as the iris closes. And then she\u0027s gone and only the swirling light remains. And Zero wonders if there\u0027s a heaven. For Romy\u0027s sake he hopes so, because he knows that\u0027s where she\u0027ll go when her time is up. But what about him? Did he retain enough of that transcendent spark to allow him to pass on into another life? Will he be welcomed? Or rejected as unfit? He never fit anywhere during his earthly life. Just once in his existence he\u0027d like to feel he fits somewhere. Wouldn\u0027t that be wonderful. And now the light suffuses him and he\u0027s floating... Dazed, Patrick dropped to his knees beside Romy where she cradled Zero\u0027s head on her lap. She was bent over his face, weeping. The sound tore at his heart. One look at Zero\u0027s glazed eyes and Patrick knew he was gone. But maybe Romy hadn\u0027t realized that yet. He didn\u0027t want to be the one to tell her. \"I called the security office, the county sheriff, the state police. Cops and ambulances are on the way.\" \"Too late!\" she sobbed. \"He\u0027s gone!\" \"I know,\" he said softly. He reached past her arm and closed Zero\u0027s eyes. She leaned over further and kissed his forehead. \"I loved him, Patrick.\" \"And he loved you. You should have heard how he talked about you. And it wasn\u0027t just talk. He loved you enough to die for you.\" \"I want him back.\" \"I know...I know...\" Heputa hand on her shoulder. \"I do too.\" \"Can I...?\" she said without looking up. \"Do you mind if I just stay here with him alone until...until they come?\" \"Sure. Of course.\" Patrick was stung, but he understood. He rose and became aware of a wet slapping sound. He saw Kek kneeling on Portero\u0027s chest. He gripped the man\u0027s ears as he repeatedly smashed the back of his head against the floor. That head, wobbly on an obviously broken neck, was bleeding from the eyes, nose, and mouth; the gray carpet was red under his skull. \"He\u0027s dead, Kek,\" Patrick said. \"You can\u0027t kill him any more.\" Kek looked up with tears in his eyes, then, without missing a beat, went back to his work. Suddenly Patrick remembered Tome. He whirled and found the old sim squatting on the carpet a few feet away, his face buried in the arms folded atop his knees. \"Tome? Are you hurt?\" The sim looked up with tear-filled eyes. \"Ver sad, Mist Sulliman. All Tome\u0027s fault.\" \"No way, Tome,\" he said, feeling a surge of anger. \"Weknow whose fault this is, and it\u0027s not yours.\" With that Patrick turned toward the CEO\u0027s desk and saw Ellis rise from behind it. He shot him a question with his eyes, and Ellis shook his head. His expression was grim and sad, but no tears. Three men dead in less than half a minute. Yes, men. From this day on Patrick swore to remember Zero as a man. Although, considering the two others who\u0027d joined him in death, that might not be a compliment. As sirens began to wail outside, he wanted to ask Ellis Sinclair where they went from here, but the rhythmic smacking of Portero\u0027s head against the wet carpet was turning his stomach. \"Kek! Stop! Please!\" But the mandrilla ignored him. \"Can\u0027t somebody stop him?\" \"Let him be,\" Romy said in a flat tone without looking up. \"Let him take as long as he wants.\" Epilogue \"I still can\u0027t believe it,\" Abel Voss said. \"Neither can I,\" Ellis replied. The two of them sat in Mercer\u0027s old office. Less than a week now since death had filled this space. Ellis had ordered the carpets cleaned, but the removal of the bloodstains had been only partially successful. He\u0027d expected that, and had declined to order new carpet. Just as he\u0027d declined to repair the cracked picture window. He didn\u0027t want to help anyone, especially himself, forget what had happened here. He\u0027d attended funerals of two brothers since that day. At Mercer\u0027s he was part of a huge throng of mourners, none of whom shed a tear. At Zero\u0027s he stood among a few select members of the organization - Dr. Cannon and Reverend Eckert among them - all weeping openly. He\u0027d been a central figure at the first; he\u0027d had to invite himself to the second, his presence tolerated only because he claimed a blood relationship. \"Then again,\" Voss said, \"when you think about it, who else was he gonna leave it to?\" Mercer\u0027s personal attorney had read his will this morning. He\u0027d left all his stock to Ellis, who was still in shock. \"It was an old will,\" Ellis said. \"If he\u0027d had the slightest inkling he was going to die, I\u0027m sure he would have changed it. But Merce thought he\u0027d go on forever. Or damn near.\" \"So now that you\u0027re the absolute head honcho, what\u0027s your first step?\" \"I\u0027ve already taken it,\" Ellis said, rising and moving to the window. \"I\u0027m shutting down the natal centers. No new sim embryos implanted, all unborns aborted.\" Killing unborn sims...the idea sickened him. But it had to stop now. Voss grunted. \"That leaves us a company without a product. But I guess you\u0027re just stayin ahead of the curve, seein as how the government will pretty soon be gettin around to forcin us to do just that.\" How true. News networks around the world had picked up the film of Meerm\u0027s delivery; repeated broadcasts had raised a firestorm of protest: if sims and humans can interbreed, then sims should be members of the human genus. If they only knew. But they never would. Romy and Patrick had struck a deal: they would never reveal what they knew if Ellis never revealed that Romy would be raising Meerm\u0027s baby, who she\u0027d named Una. She wanted the child - mother a sim, father a pervert - to grow up out of the limelight without ever knowing her origins. Fair enough. Una and her mother had already done enough to further the sim cause. Ellis would do the rest. \"Okay,\" Voss said. \"So no new sims. What about all the others out there already?\" \"I\u0027m going to start recalling them. I want you to get the ball rolling on building dorms for them on our Arizona land. I want them built as fast as possible. As soon as a block is ready for habitation, I\u0027ll cancel enough leases to fill it. That\u0027s the way we\u0027ll do it: a rolling recall until every living sim is out of the workforce and assured of freedom and comfort for the rest of their lives.\" Voss swallowed. \"At least they don\u0027t live too long, but even so, you\u0027re gonna bankrupt the company, son!\" \"Most likely.\" He looked out at the gleaming buildings of the main campus, and the rolling hills beyond. \"But we\u0027ve got lots of hard assets. We\u0027ll sell them all.\" And when that\u0027s not enough, he thought, I\u0027ll use my own funds, every last penny if necessary. Ellis Sinclair figured he was long overdue to become his brothers\u0027 keeper.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-109.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true.
