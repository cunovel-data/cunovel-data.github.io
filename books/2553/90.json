The air seemed close in the spare, windowless little procedure room. Patrick had walked out - the sim\u0027s distress had been too much for him - leaving Romy alone with Betsy and Meerm. Betsy looked up at her. \"The contractions have subsided.\" \"How long can this go on?\" Romy asked, relieved the sim\u0027s pain had finally eased. Betsy shook her head. \"Not too much longer. I was right in the middle of an ultrasound when she started having contractions. I\u0027d love to give the baby another week but Meerm\u0027s uterus won\u0027t last that long.\" \"Why baby hurt Meerm?\" the sim said. \"As I told you, Meerm,\" Betsy said softly, \"the baby\u0027s not trying to hurt you. It\u0027s just that you\u0027re too small and the baby\u0027s too large.\" She turned to Romy and lowered her voice. \"I tried to give her an anatomy lesson earlier. I don\u0027t know how much of it took.\" \"On the new ultrasound,\" Romy said, \"did you see what sex it was?\" Betsy smiled. \"Meerm wanted to know too. Isn\u0027t that something? I didn\u0027t think sims differentiated that much between sexes, but she was very curious. She wants a girl.\" \"And?\" \"Can\u0027t say. The baby\u0027s packed in too tight. If I had one of the higher resolution imagers I could tell, but not with this model. I\u0027ll do another one tomorrow. Maybe we\u0027ll get lucky.\" \"Yes. It would be nice to be able to call the baby \u0027he\u0027 or \u0027she\u0027 instead of \u0027it.\u0027\" \"Indeed it would. Oh, by the way, Zero called to see how the night went.\" \"When will he be here?\" \"He won\u0027t. He thinks it\u0027s safer for all concerned if I\u0027m the only one seen coming and going from here.\" Romy hoped her disappointment didn\u0027t show. She needed to talk to Zero - not on the phone, but face to face. Her emotions were still in wild turmoil, but she needed to know howhe felt, and whathe wanted. Once she knew that, she could begin to sort out her own feelings, make some decisions. She didn\u0027t know what the future held, but she was keeping all options open for now. Then Patrick stuck his head into the little room. \"I think the house is being watched.\" Romy felt her shoulders tighten. \"You\u0027re sure?\" \"I haven\u0027t seen men with binoculars trained on us, but someone\u0027s sitting in a car parked up the street facing this way, and he\u0027s been there for a while.\" \"Show me.\" He led her to the picture window in the living room. It was midday but the low gray sky shed little light into the room. Romy reached for a lamp, then thought better of it. \"Damn,\" Patrick said. \"It\u0027s gone. But I tell you, it was sitting right over there for a good half hour.\" Romy scanned the street and saw a blue sedan parked against the curb at the other end. \"Was that there before?\" she asked, pointing. \"No,\" Patrick said. \"I\u0027m sure it wasn\u0027t. And this one\u0027s got - doesn\u0027t that look like two men inside?\" \"Yes, it does,\" Betsy said, coming up behind them. \"I\u0027m calling the police.\" \"Is that such a good idea?\" Patrick said. Romy smiled. \"I think it\u0027s a great idea. If theyknew something, they\u0027d havedone something. Betsy left SimGen with a roar, so it\u0027s no surprise they\u0027re watching her. Probably watching a number of ex-Natal- Center people. But why should we let them have an easy time of it? Let\u0027s make them explain to the local constabulary what they\u0027re doing out there.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-90.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
