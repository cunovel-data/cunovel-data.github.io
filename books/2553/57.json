{"id":111813,"no":57,"title":"Page 57","content":"MANHATTAN DECEMBER 15 \"This is fabulous!\" Patrick shouted, venting his glee. \"Ab-so-lute-ly faaaaabulous!\" He shuffled in a circle around the cracked concrete floor, punching the air, wanting to laugh aloud but fearing if he ever let himself get started he might not be able to stop. Zero had called Romy and him to a meeting here in the garage without hinting at what it might be about. Patrick wished he could have watched Zero\u0027s face, especially his eyes, as he\u0027d laid the news on them about a sim made pregnant by a human. He hadn\u0027t been able to fathom the mystery man\u0027s feelings through the ski mask and shades, but Patrick knew exactly howhe felt. Suddenly his whole world had burst wide open in a blinding blaze of glory. Lawyers dream about an opportunity like this. Dream, hell, most of them didn\u0027t even have the capacity to imagine something like this. It was a home run. In the bottom of the ninth. With the bases loaded. On Christmas Day. With a winning lotto ticket waiting in the dugout. Life was good, life was sooooo good! Finally he turned back to Romy and Zero. As usual, Zero hung back in the shadows; Romy stood by the panel truck; both were watching him as if he were mad. He glanced up at the square of darkness in the ceiling above the ladder fastened to the rear wall. No eyes peering at him this time. But even if there were, it wouldn\u0027t have fazed him. Not today. \"I get a feeling I\u0027ve made Mr. Sullivan\u0027s day,\" Zero said, ostensibly to Romy. \"I think you made his year,\" she said, her expression troubled. Patrick couldn\u0027t figure that. She should be beaming. \"Year?\"he cried. \"This makes mylife! A baby with a sim mother and a human father! Don\u0027t you see what this means?\" \"Of course,\" Zero said. \"Undeniable proof that humans and sims can cross-fertilize.\" \"Right! And that means they have to be upgraded into the same category as humans.\" \"It\u0027s called \u0027genus,\u0027\" Zero said, \"not category.\" \"Oh, right.\" He\u0027d never found science very interesting. No juice. \"Genus and species. We\u0027reHomo sapiens , right? So what genus are sims?\" \"Start with the root: the animal kingdom; from there you move to the Chordata phylum, then to the Mammalia class. The next divisions are known as \u0027orders.\u0027 Humans, apes, monkeys, even tree shrews are all members of the Primate order. But after that we branch into different families. Chimps, gorillas, and orangutans are classified as members of the Pongidae family, while humans are the only existing members of the Hominidae family.\" \"Pongidae...Hominidae,\" Patrick said, rolling the unfamiliar words over his tongue. He guessed scientists were like lawyers, using dead languages to confuse and confute. \"Even before sims were created,\" Zero was saying, \"there were movements in the scientific community to shift chimps to the Hominidae family, and they might have succeeded if not for SimGen. Once SimGen got into the act, the movement ran out of gas.\" Romy said, \"I\u0027ve never understood how one corporation could wield so much influence.\" \"Money,\" Zero said. Her brow furrowed. \"I can see that working where legislation is involved, but how can you buy a scientific classification?\" \"With grants. The right amount of money to the right universities to see the right man as head of the right department, and suddenly there are more important concerns than to which familyPan troglodytes belong. And so chimps stayed Pongidae.\" \"Pan troglodytes,\" Patrick said. \"That\u0027s the chimp genus and species, right?\" Zero nodded. \"And sims are known asPan sinclairis of the family Pongidae.\" \"Pan sinclairis,\" Patrick said, shaking his head. \"Talk about ego.\" Then he grinned. \"But no amount of grants is going to keep them out of Hominidae once word gets out about this baby. We\u0027ll move them up to theHomo genus and get them a brand new name:Homo simiens . How does that sound?\" \"It sounds like the end of SimGen,\" Zero said. \"Damn right. Move sims to genus Homo, they become humans. And since owning a human hasn\u0027t been legal since the Emancipation Proclamation, SimGen loses everything. Tome and I are going to lead the biggest class action lawsuit this world has ever seen. The tobacco settlements will look like chump change. Every sim will have a Caddy and a condo, and the Sinclair brothers, when I\u0027m through with them, will be living on the street.\" Patrick waited for a reaction - a laugh, a cheer, encouragement, anything - but Zero remained silent behind his shields, while Romy frowned and seemed to be miles away. \"I won\u0027t even take the customary thirty or forty percent,\" he added. \"I\u0027ll settle for one point.\" Plus expenses, of course. He could handle one percent of a zillion - last him the rest of his life and then some. Still no reaction from either of them. He felt like a singer with a dead mike. Finally Zero stirred, lacing his gloved fingers and popping the knuckles. \"All fine and good, Patrick, but your scenario is missing one crucial element: You need proof.\" \"Oh. Yeah. Right.\" No arguing with that: no pregnant sim, no case. \"And we can\u0027t offer five million for a tip.\" \"No,\" Patrick said, \"but maybe you can intercept that tip.\" \"How do you propose I do that?\" \"Obviously you\u0027ve got a line into the heart of SimGen.\" He noticed Zero stiffen into a wary pose. \"Obviously?\" \"Sure. How else could you come by all this inside information. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a person or a bug, and I don\u0027t want to know. What I\u0027m saying is, if we can intercept the crucial tip, or even get it at the same time SimGen does, maybe we can reach this sim - \" \"She\u0027s got a name: Meerm.\" \"See? You even know her name. So if we can use the tip to reach her before SimGen does, we\u0027re golden.\" Zero shook his head. \"I doubt that\u0027s possible. All tips will be directed to Luca Portero, and he\u0027s not the type to share information, even with the Sinclairs.\" \"Well...,\" Patrick said slowly, discarding a new idea immediately, but voicing it just to get a rise out of Romy. \"He does have the hots for Romy...\" \"Don\u0027t even think about it,\" she snapped. \"Joke, Romy.\" At least she\u0027d been listening. \"Are you okay?\" She shook her head. \"Not really. Something about this bothers me. How can a sim and a human cross- fertilize? Sims have twenty-two chromosome pairs and humans have twenty-three. Somewhere along the line they\u0027re not going to match up, and a pair of chromosomes is going to be left hanging.\" \"Not necessarily,\" Zero said. \"Look at the mule. Its father is a donkey, which has thirty-one pairs and its mother is a horse, which has thirty-two, though both are members of the genusEquus . Mules have been around for ages with no problems from the dangling chromosomes, other than the fact that they\u0027re usually sterile.\" Romy\u0027s frown deepened. \"Then this baby, if it\u0027s ever born, will probably be sterile too.\" \"We\u0027ll have to see. We\u0027re in uncharted territory here.\" \"So a mule,\" Patrick said, \"is the offspring of a male donkey and a female horse. What if it\u0027s the other way around?\" \"That\u0027s a less common combination, but then you get something called a hinny. They look like mules but tend to be smaller because most donkeys are smaller than horses.\" \"Where do all these fascinating tidbits of animal husbandry leave us?\" Patrick said. \"With the realization that, given a fertile sim, a human-sim hybrid is a very real possibility.\" \"I keep thinking about that baby,\" Romy said. \"What\u0027s going to happen to it? Who\u0027ll take care of it? And being neither sim nor human, what place will it have in the world?\" Zero\u0027s tone softened. \"Until we find Meerm I suggest you put off worrying about the baby. Given your nature, I know that won\u0027t be easy, but your own safety should be at the top of your list right now. You won\u0027t be able to help that baby if anything happens to you.\" Patrick felt the muscles between his shoulder blades tighten. \"What do you mean, \u0027happens\u0027?\" He sighed. \"You haven\u0027t heard the whole story yet.\" \"What are you holding back?\" \"Nothing. I never had a chance to finish. Your war dance got us off track.\" Romy eyed Zero. \"There\u0027s a poor, frightened sim whore out there pregnant by a human degenerate. Isn\u0027t that enough?\" \"I never mentioned a whore, sim or otherwise.\" \"I just assumed...\" Zero looked at Romy. \"You might want to sit down.\" \"Oh, no.\" She stood blinking for a few heartbeats, then retreated two steps and dropped into the chair by the wall. \"Do I want to hear this?\" \"Probably not, but you need to.\" Zero then went on to explain who was behind the SLA and the reasons for its atrocities. Patrick listened, but all the while his eyes were fixed on Romy. He watched her initial disbelief give way to unwilling acceptance of a horrifying truth. Her expression was slack by the time Zero finished. He wanted to step to her side and slip his arms around her, but thought better of it. Jostle her now and she might explode. Patrick too was shocked. To think that just two weeks ago in front of the burned-out ruins of the Bronx globulin farm, Romy had introduced him to the engineer of all this death and destruction. \"There\u0027s got to be some way we can nail Portero for this,\" Patrick said. \"Don\u0027t count on it. He\u0027s a pro, a very careful one.\" \"That doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t manufacture some evidence.\" \"No,\" Zero said, shaking his head. \"Too dangerous.\" Romy finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I...I\u0027d always figured Portero for a snake. But...I never dreamed...I mean, executing three humans and twelve sims...just to cover his tracks.\" \"And those are just the ones we know about. You two might have been added to list if we hadn\u0027t intervened when Patrick\u0027s car was knocked off the road.\" \"That was him?\" Patrick said, turning toward Romy. \"You mean I was standing two feet away from the guy who tried to kill me and I didn\u0027t know it?\" \"Not him directly,\" Zero said. \"But he planned it.\" \"Why didn\u0027t anyone tell me?\" He shrugged. \"No one said, \u0027Let\u0027s not tell Patrick.\u0027 When it happened, we still weren\u0027t sure of you. And after you came on board, it simply never came up.\" \"Just as well, I guess,\" he said. \"If I\u0027d known I might have opened my big yap and given something away.\" \"Which brings me back to what I was saying before,\" Zero said. \"Watch your backs. You and Romy have put yourselves on the wrong side of Manassas Ventures. Manassas is connected to SimGen and therefore, by extension, to Luca Portero. We\u0027ve known he was ruthless, we just didn\u0027t know until nowhow ruthless. There\u0027s nothing this man won\u0027t do, so please be careful. I\u0027ll do whatever I can to back you up, but the organization can do only so much.\" Patrick turned to Romy. \"Maybe we should move in together.\" She rolled her eyes. \"Not that again.\" \"For mutual protection, of course.\" \"Of course.\" \"Not such a bad idea, actually,\" Zero said. \"I know I\u0027d rest easier, but I\u0027ll leave that up to you two.\" Zero, I think I love you, Patrick thought. But Romy didn\u0027t appear to be buying. \"Let\u0027s worry about Meerm,\" she said. \"How do we find her first?\" \"Why don\u0027t we try thinking like a sim?\" Patrick said, hating to leave the subject of cohabitation. \"If I were a lost and frightened sim, where would I hide?\" \"With other sims,\" Zero said. \"The trouble is, if she\u0027s hiding from humans she\u0027s not exactly going to come out and announce herself.\" Patrick had a thought. \"How about my roomie? Is there some way Tome can help sniff her out? You know, set a sim to find a sim?\" Zero pointed at him. \"Now that\u0027s an idea.\" \"As long as it doesn\u0027t put him in any danger,\" Patrick added. He\u0027d grown fond of that old sim, and the possibility of anything happening to him put a twist in his gut. \"I don\u0027t want him hurt.\" \"None of us do,\" Zero said. \"Let\u0027s sit down and see where we can take that. Meanwhile, I\u0027ve appealed to a higher power for help.\" \"You\u0027ve been praying?\" Romy said. \"No, I meant that in a more literal sense. I was speaking of the Reverend\u0027s satellite.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-57.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true.
