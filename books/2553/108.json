He\u0027d wanted to avoid any small talk because he could barely hear his own thoughts, but he\u0027d take ringing in his ear over a hole in his head any day. When he\u0027d buried an AK-47 and an extra pistol in a waterproof gun case, he\u0027d doubted he\u0027d ever have to use them. It was simply a precautionary measure. But when Lister had told him it was time to \"do the right thing,\" he\u0027d known exactly where he wanted to do it. Do the right thing...was Lister crazy? Like there was some sort of honor in executing yourself instead of making somebody else do it? What century was he living in? Correction:used to live in. Luca had raised the pistol to his head but pointed at the very rear of his skull. At the last second he\u0027d angled it even further rearward to send the slug past the back of his head. But the report had damn near deafened him. He might never hear out of his right ear again. He\u0027d dropped right onto the spot where he\u0027d buried the gun case. The two inches of covering dirt scraped off quickly. The pistols Lister\u0027s butt boys were carrying were nothing against the Kalashnikov. After they were down, Portero ran back and caught Lister trying to get away in his car. The bastard had squealed for mercy, screaming about friendship - friendship!After handing me a pistol so I could off myself! Luca blew his head off. Now he had to sky out of the country. No need for panic. No one here knew about Lister. He figured he had hours yet, and wanted to use some of that to deal with his office computer. He\u0027d been scrupulous about avoiding any links to his numbered account in Bermuda, but you couldn\u0027t be too careful where SIRG was involved. They had people who could drag all sorts of information from a supposedly destroyed memory chip. So the chip was going with him. The ocean floor dropped to a couple of miles deep off Bermuda; he\u0027d bury the chip at sea. As expected, the campus was all but deserted. Only a few security personnel about. Perfect. He\u0027d just sat down before his computer and was preparing to open the box and tear out the memory chip, when he heard his office door open behind him. His fingers closed around the grip of his .45. \"Oh, it\u0027s you, Mr. Portero,\" said a voice he couldn\u0027t place. \"I didn\u0027t expect you in today.\" He turned and recognized one of the newer men on the security force - knew the face but not the name. He\u0027d been hired last summer; low on the ladder, which was no doubt how he\u0027d pulled Christmas duty. \"Yeah,\" Luca said. \"Just checking on something before I go home.\" \"Lots of brass in today.\" Luca\u0027s ears were singing and the last thing he needed was chitchat with this kid, but his curiosity got the better of him. \"Really? Who?\" \"Both Sinclairs. First the big guy copters in. Then Ellis Sinclair arrives in this beat-up van, driving it himself.\" \"Is that a fact?\" Luca wasn\u0027t surprised. If there was any time for a crisis meeting it was now. \"And you\u0027ll never believe who was with him: that fox from OPRR - you know, the one who led the inspection a few - \" \"Romy Cadman,\" Luca said, and felt his blood jump a few degrees. The bitch was back. And with Sinclair-2. So they were no longer hiding their connection. Lister had put the blame on Luca, but that was wrong. This wastheir fault. Especially hers. Things had started downhill the moment she arrived. If not for Romy Cadman he\u0027d still be sitting pretty here, building his retirement account, planning ways to move up the SIRG ladder. Instead he was on the run and would have to keep on running the rest of his life. Maybe it was fate that had brought him back at this moment. He had scores to settle, scales to balance. What was the expression - in for a dime, in for a dollar? He\u0027d left a pile of bodies back at his house; no reason why he couldn\u0027t leave a few more in Sinclair-1\u0027s office.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-108.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
