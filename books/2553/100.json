To Romy\u0027s horror, she\u0027d had to watch while Betsy cracked open Meerm\u0027s chest and manually compressed her heart. She was still at it, working like a mad woman. \"We\u0027ve still got a chance!\"\\n\\n \"Betsy, she is dead.\"\\n\\n Romy looked at the anesthetist\u0027s black eyes and noticed they were rimmed with tears. Joanna\u0027s too. Romy knew they mirrored her own. They all knew that Meerm wasn\u0027t coming back.\\n\\n She reached across and gently gripped Betsy\u0027s forearms. \"She\u0027s right, Betsy. Meerm\u0027s gone. You did your best but - \"\\n\\n \"I should have brought her in sooner!\" Betsy wailed. She leaned forward over Meerm\u0027s inert heart, and sobbed. \"But I was worried about the baby! Damn it, damn it, damn it!\"\\n\\n \"You did all you could,\" Romy said, touching the back of her sweat-soaked scrubs. \"But she - \"\\n\\n Zero burst through the OR doors. \"We have to go! SIRG just stormed into the lobby, armed to the teeth!\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s SIRG?\" Joanna said, gaping at Zero\u0027s mask. \"And who the hell are you?\"\\n\\n \"A friend,\" Betsy said, ripping off her bloody gloves. She\u0027d regained some of her composure but seemed exhausted.\\n\\n \"And SIRG,\" Romy added, feeling her gut clench, \"is a group that wants to kill that baby.\"\\n\\n \"Like hell they will!\" Joanna cried.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go!\" Betsy said. \"We\u0027ve got a minute, maybe two at the most before they\u0027re here!\"\\n\\n \"But what about Meerm?\" Romy said.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have to leave her.\"\\n\\n \"No - \"\\n\\n \"Romy,\" Zero said softly, \"I grieve for her as much as you - more than you - but they won\u0027t be interested in Meerm now; they\u0027ll want her baby, and we can\u0027t let them have her.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll take her,\" Joanna said. \"Madhuri, Betsy, and me. We\u0027ll put her in an isolette and hide her in a motel or something.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s an isolette?\" Patrick asked. He was still holding the baby and seemed very protective.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an incubator of sorts,\" Madhuri said. \"A special enclosed container we use for preemies. Keeps them safe and warm.\"\\n\\n \"Good idea,\" Betsy said. \"Since they probably know my car, we\u0027ll leave it here and take one of yours.\"\\n\\n Joanna said, \"We\u0027ll rustle up a portable isolette and meet you at the doctor\u0027s entrance.\"\\n\\n She and Madhuri bustled off while Betsy and Romy pulled a green sheet over Meerm\u0027s body. As the rest of them hurried out into the hall with the baby, Romy hung back. She rested a hand on the lifeless form beneath the sheet.\\n\\n \"You never had a chance, did you,\" she whispered. \"But things are going to change. And whenever people talk about the change, they\u0027ll mention your name.\"\\n\\n Small goddamn consolation, she thought as she hurried away to catch up to the others. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-100.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) \\n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \\n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \\n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \\n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
