It was clear after last night that she was under surveillance, so she\u0027d picked a spot at random and wound up in a coffee shop not far from the federal district courthouse in White Plains. At this hour - 10:32A .M. - the dining area contained only a handful of late breakfasters, and the ladies\u0027 room was empty; she\u0027d checked all the stalls before calling.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sure? Absolutely sure?\"\\n\\n The concern in his voice touched her. \"Absolutely. Those martial arts lessons you made me take came in handy.\"\\n\\n \"I never thought you\u0027d be in physical danger, but I felt it best you be prepared for it.\"\\n\\n \"If nothing else, it\u0027s helped me keep my cool.\"\\n\\n Relative cool, she thought. Her nerves were still jangled. She\u0027d tried to rest at the motel - in her own room, much to Patrick\u0027s dismay - but sleep had remained steadfastly out of reach; so she\u0027d compensated this morning by drinking too much coffee, which did nothing to settle her nerves.\\n\\n She caught sight of herself in one of the mirrors. A little haggard looking, but not half bad for someone who\u0027d ducked an attempt on her life just a few hours ago.\\n\\n \"But murder?\" she said. \"Somehow I don\u0027t see the brothers Sinclair sitting around and deciding to have us killed.\"\\n\\n \"That decision was reached elsewhere, I\u0027m sure. By someone connected to the company but with his own best interests at heart.\"\\n\\n \"Someone also connected to Manassas Ventures, perhaps?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps. Our investigation into that little company keeps coming up empty. It seems to exist in a vacuum. We\u0027ve avoided direct inquiries, keeping everything back door because we don\u0027t want to let them know anyone\u0027s interested. But if nothing pans out soon we may have to arrange a little accident.\"\\n\\n \"Accident?\"\\n\\n He went on without elaborating. \"In the meantime we want to keep you and Patrick alive and well. Connecting SimGen to the vans was a brilliant stroke. Your idea?\"\\n\\n \"No. Patrick\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Clever fellow. The Beacon Ridge sims could do a lot worse.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m beginning to see that.\" After last night, despite his tough talk, she\u0027d half expected him to wake up this morning and run off with his tail tucked between his legs. But he was in court now, arguing motions. \"What I don\u0027t see is how you managed to be down in that ravine with us.\"\\n\\n \"Iwasn\u0027t there.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mean you personally - the organization.\"\\n\\n \"We had a tail on Portero.\"\\n\\n That startled her. \"For how long?\"\\n\\n \"Long enough to see him rent a couple of vans. After that, we kept an eye on the vans. When some mercenary types became attached to the vans, I suspected strong-arm tactics were in the works. Some of our people followed one van to that ravine and you-know-who intervened.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad.\"\\n\\n \"So am I. I\u0027d never forgive myself if...\" He cleared his throat. \"Anyway, the gloves are off, I\u0027m afraid. The organization is going to mount its own surveillance on you and Patrick. The Beacon Ridge barrack as well.\"\\n\\n Romy\u0027s stomach turned. \"Oh, no. You don\u0027t think - \"\\n\\n \"Anything is possible. And we must be prepared for it.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-30.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) \\n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \\n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \\n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \\n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
