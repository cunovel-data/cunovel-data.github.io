{"id":111816,"no":60,"title":"Page 60","content":"Every muscle in Luca\u0027s body wound tight as he let himself into the foyer of Romy Cadman\u0027s apartment building. Something had gone wrong. He didn\u0027t know what, couldn\u0027t imagine what, but Palmer and Jackson weren\u0027t answering his calls.\\n\\n They\u0027d been flown in from the Idaho facility especially for this op - both of them experienced men who\u0027d return there immediately after they completed their work. The chance of Cadman or Sullivan ever seeing either of them again was nil. They\u0027d called in when they\u0027d set themselves up in the apartment; they\u0027d responded when the surveillance team in the car outside let them know that both the woman and Sullivan were on their way up.\\n\\n But that had been over an hour ago. No one had heard from them since. No one had entered or left the building since Cadman and Sullivan\u0027s arrival.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t help remembering the first time he\u0027d run an op against these two: a humiliating failure and two of his men dead.\\n\\n Not again, he thought, almost a prayer. Please, not again.\\n\\n But the previous op had been a complicated outdoor job, with innumerable variables; this one was in a small apartment, a limited, controlled field of operation that Palmer and Jackson had secured beforehand. What was wrong? An hour was more than enough for a pair of armed pros to deal with two unarmed civilians, juice them up with Totuus, and record the answers to a few questions. Like, who do you take instructions from, where do you get your money, and so on.\\n\\n Luca had wanted to be there, and would have been if termination had been in the plan; but since Cadman and Sullivan were going to be released, he couldn\u0027t risk showing his face.\\n\\n He hurried up the stairs. Key in hand, he pressed his ear against the door to 3A and knocked. No sound from within, not a whisper, not a rustle. He knocked again, same result.\\n\\n Steeling himself for what might lie within - visions of Ricker\u0027s and Green\u0027s smashed skulls from the last time flashed through his brain - Luca unlocked the door and stepped inside.\\n\\n Empty silence. Quick dodges in and out of the rooms, another circuit to check out the closets, and then back to the center of the front room, to wander in a slow, baffled circle. Where the hell was everybody? Could he be in the wrong apartment?\\n\\n And then he spotted white fragments and powder on the carpet in the corner. He stepped closer and recognized it as plaster. A quick look up and he found a deep pock in the wall. Bullet hole. Fresh one. Looked for more but came up empty.\\n\\n He felt his pulse kick up. Someone had got off a shot, but only one. That confirmed that he was in the right place. But where did everybody go? He stepped to the window and looked down at the small rear courtyard. No way out here - the fire escape was in front. They had to be hiding in another apartment - the only possible answer. He\u0027d keep the building under surveillance. Sooner or later they had to show themselves.\\n\\n But what if they weren\u0027t here? What if they\u0027d got away clean?\\n\\n He pulled out his PCA and called down to the surveillance car across the street. \"Anybody leave since I\u0027ve been inside?\"\\n\\n \"Negative.\" Snyder\u0027s voice. He and Lowery were on watch. \"Saw a grayish van pull out of an alley half a block down right after you went in, but that\u0027s about it.\"\\n\\n A van. Could that be...?\\n\\n \"Did you get the plate number?\"\\n\\n \"Yep. You want a read back?\"\\n\\n Luca closed his eyes. Thank God for Snyder. At least someone was on the ball. \"No. But don\u0027t lose it. It might be important.\"\\n\\n And then again, it might not mean a goddamn thing.\\n\\n Luca Portero dried his sweaty palms on his coat sleeves. Two more men gone, and he knew no more now about who was behind Cadman and Sullivan than he did before.\\n\\n How the hell was he going to tell Lister? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-60.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) \\n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \\n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \\n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \\n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
