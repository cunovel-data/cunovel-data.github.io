As he drove he pondered how to tackle this sim union thing, and wondered why he was attracted to it. He smiled, realizing the two things he most enjoyed in his professional life were making money and pissing off people he didn\u0027t like - in that order. And when he could combine the two, that was heaven. Better than sex. Well, almost.\\n\\n A bid to unionize the Beacon Ridge sims would be a definite two-fer.\\n\\n As he wound through the back streets of Katonah he tried to organize what he knew about sims. They weren\u0027t news anymore but they hadn\u0027t been around long enough to be taken for granted. He was old enough to remember the uproar when Mercer Sinclair introduced the first sim at an international genetics conference in Toronto.\\n\\n He shook his head. He remembered how at the time it had been all anybody talked about. Religious groups, animal rights groups, and branches of the government from the FTC to the FDA had raised holy hell. You couldn\u0027t turn on a TV or radio without hearing about sims or the Sinclairs.\\n\\n Everybody knew the Sinclair brothers\u0027 story. Sims hadn\u0027t been their first brush with genetic notoriety. Ellis and Mercer started gene-swapping while grad students at Yale, published some groundbreaking papers, then quit and went into business for themselves. Their first \"product\" had been an instant success: a dander-free feline pet for people allergic to cats. They used the enormous profits from that to start work on altering apes.\\n\\n What they came up with was a creature more than chimpanzee and less than human. As Mercer Sinclair, the brother who seemed to do all the talking, had tirelessly explained on every show from Leno to Letterman to Ackenbury, and anyone else who had an audience, they\u0027d settled on the chimpanzee because its genome was so close to a human\u0027s - a ninety-eight-point-four percent match-up in their DNA. As Sinclair liked to point out, there was far greater genetic difference between a chimp and a gorilla, or between the different species of squirrels running around the average backyard.\\n\\n One-point-six percent, Patrick thought, shaking his head...the difference between me and a monkey. If ninety percent of DNA was useless junk, how many genes was that? Couldn\u0027t be many.\\n\\n With so much shared DNA, it hadn\u0027t taken a whole lot of germ-line engineering to produce a larger skull - allowing for a larger brain, greater intelligence, and the intellectual capacity for speech - and a larger, sturdier, more humanlike skeleton. That took care of functional requirements. Smaller ears, less hirsute skin, a smaller lower jaw, and other refinements made for a creature that looked far more human than a chimp, one that might be mistaken for aHomo erectus , but never for aHomo sap .\\n\\n The result was the sim: a good worker, agile, docile, with no interest in sex or money. Not an Einstein among them, but bright enough to speak a stilted form of whatever language they grew up with.\\n\\n To manufacture and market the product - Mercer Sinclair insisted from the get-go on referring to sims as a product - the brothers had formed SimGen. And SimGen got the government to agree that the creatures were just that: a product.\\n\\n How they accomplished that feat remained a mystery to Patrick and lots of other folks. President Bush the Second had come out against the whole idea, calling it \"Godless science,\" and the Democratic congress, with its hands deep in the pockets of the very anti-sim Big Labor, was ready to put the kibosh on the whole thing. SimGen stock was in the toilet.\\n\\n But somehow anti-sim legislation kept getting deadlocked in various committees; for some unfathomable reason, union bluster tapered off.\\n\\n Instead of waiting for the ax to fall, SimGen started cranking out sims for the unskilled labor markets. Common consensus was that the Sinclair brothers had lost their minds and very soon would lose their shirts. Who\u0027d want transgenic laborers during a global recession with millions of humans out of work.\\n\\n The Bush administration, wrapped up in the seemingly endless war on terrorism, failed to pass any regulatory bills. And then came the boom of the mid-oughts, making the nineties look like a pop gun and tightening all the labor markets. Suddenly sims weren\u0027t such a godless idea after all. In fact, they made good economic sense. They even allowed the US to compete with Asia in the textile markets. The result: A lot of senators and congressmen who previously might have been expected to vote against, came out in support of pro-SimGen legislation.\\n\\n Patrick remembered how animal rights activists had cried foul and said the fix was in, but nothing was ever proven, and in those days SimGen hadn\u0027t anywhere near the money to buy off so many legislators.\\n\\n Now was a different story, of course. SimGen had been raking in the megabucks for years. As the darling of mutual funds and small investors alike, its market cap value was soaring.\\n\\n All of which made Patrick feel like a microminiature David. Because the real heavyweight opposition to organizing the sims would come from the SimGen Goliath. The last thing they\u0027d want was someone unionizing their property.\\n\\n What he needed were allies. But who? The religious fundamentalists would be no help; Orthodox Jews, Moslems, and Christian Born Agains had found common ground in their opposition to sims, but they wanted sims abolished, not unionized. The animal rights groups like PETA and Greenpeace were a possibility, but they seemed to be in disarray; they\u0027d tried guerrilla tactics like raiding piecework shops and \"liberating\" the sim workers; but the sims, unused to freedom, and lost and confused in the big wide world, wound up returning to the shops on their own.\\n\\n Patrick could see that he was going to be all alone out there.\\n\\n On the other hand, maybe SimGen wouldn\u0027t bother to lift a finger. Maybe they\u0027d know what Patrick knew: that he didn\u0027t have a kitten\u0027s chance in a room full of pit bulls. But what he could do was raise a ruckus and embarrass the hell out of Beacon Ridge, then settle out of court for a nice piece of change. That was what he\u0027d aim for.\\n\\n But after that...what? What would the Beacon Ridge sims do with their money? Maybe Patrick could convince them to start a practice of tipping thegolfers . He smiled. Wouldn\u0027t that be a kick.\\n\\n He checked his watch: 10:14. Time to meet with his new clients.\\n\\n He parked on a side street near the creek that ran through the grounds. Yellow legal pad in hand, he stepped out, found an opening in the high privet hedge, and for some reason thought of his father.\\n\\n Mike Sullivan was a retired steamfitter who had been a diehard union man all his life. He\u0027d raised his family within earshot of the Rensselaer rail-yards outside Albany until Patrick was twelve, then moved them to Dobbs Ferry. Patrick remembered how proud he\u0027d been when his son became the first member of the family to graduate college. But he hadn\u0027t been so crazy about Patrick\u0027s idea of a career in law. He couldn\u0027t afford to send him, so Patrick had paid his own way through Pace Law. If he\u0027d gone on to become a champion of the labor movement, Dad might have bragged about his son the lawyer; but Patrick had shied away from the crusader role, opting to join the lumpen proletariat of the profession in a medium-size firm, and scratch his way up through the ranks.\\n\\n Dad had been able to live with that. But would he be able to live with the idea of his son as a labor organizer - of sims?\\n\\n Do I really want to do this?\\n\\n Patrick knew he should give himself a little more time - maybe a lot more time - to weigh the pros and cons. He had an impulsive nature which he managed to control at the bargaining table, but it had put him in hot spots more than once. Did he want to start this fire?\\n\\n Damn right he did. Hell hath no fury like an attorney scorned. Beacon Ridge didn\u0027t want him? Fine. They were going to regret that. Not only was there a buck or two to be made, but instead of seeing less of the man he\u0027d blackballed, Holmes Carter was pretty soon going to feel like he was married to Patrick Sullivan.\\n\\n Here comes the bride, Patrick thought as he stepped through the hedge onto Beacon Ridge property. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-3.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) \\n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \\n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \\n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \\n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
