The sun was down but only a corner floor lamp was lit.\n Luca glanced around. No one else present. \"Watch what?\"\n \"This, goddamn it. I just recorded it off the dish.\"\n Sinclair poked his desktop and the plasma TV screen on the wall flickered, then lit with the face of the Reverend Eckert.\n \"My dear brothers and sisters. I had an entirely different sermon prepared for this broadcast, but just moments ago I experienced an epiphany, a revelation of such staggering importance that I felt it my duty to you and to my ministry to discard my prepared sermon and immediately address this matter.\n \"Do you know what an \u0027urban legend\u0027 is? I\u0027m sure you do, but in case some of you don\u0027t, let me explain. Urban legends are stories that are told and retold so many times that they take on a patina - or should I say, the appearance - of truth. We never get the story firsthand; usually we\u0027re told that somebody\u0027s uncle or aunt, or that a friend\u0027s grandmother knows someone who personally experienced the incident.\n \"You might have been warned against bringing home a large cactus because somebody knows someone whose cactus burst open to let out a torrent of deadly tarantulas.\n \"Or you heard about the burned corpse of a frogman found in the ashes of a forest fire, the story going that he was SCUBA diving when he was scooped up by a firefighting helicopter as it filled its bucket from the lake near the fire.\n \"Or the \u0027documented facts\u0027 that eelskin wallets erase magnetic cards and giant alligators infest New York City sewers, and on and on.\n \"Brothers and sisters, I could spend the whole program cataloguing these tales, but that\u0027s not why I\u0027m speaking to you today. I pray you\u0027ve caught my meaning, because I want you to believe that what I am about to say is not an urban legend.\n \"As I told you earlier, I\u0027ve had a revelation from On High. But some people, for their own selfish reasons, will want to deny its truth. My words, as they spread,will be written off by these professional doubters as just the latest in a long line of urban legends. But don\u0027t listen to them, friends. I have it on excellent authority, not from a friend of a friend, but from the ultimate Unimpeachable Source that what I am about to tell you is God\u0027s Truth.\n \"That Truth concerns a sim, a female sim, lost, alone, frightened, hiding somewhere in New York City. Yes, I\u0027m talking about the same sim that Satan\u0027s own corporation, SinGen, has offered five million dollars for. But have you asked yourselves why SinGen is offering so much for one lowly sim? They\u0027ll tell you it\u0027s to help bring murderers to justice, but is that really the case? The humans these murderers killed were criminals themselves. And sims are killed every day without SinGen offering so much as a dime to find the culprits.\n \"So there I was today, sitting alone in my home chapel, spending quiet time in communion with the Lord, wondering what was so special about this particular sim to make the devil\u0027s company squander so much of its tainted lucre to find her.\n \"And then it came to me. In a blaze of inspiration that could only be the result of the touch of the Lord his own self, I knew!\n \"This lost sim is pregnant!\n \"Now, now, I know we\u0027ve all been told that sims can\u0027t procreate, but think about who\u0027s been telling us that: the devil corporation run by Satan, the Father of Lies. Only God is perfect. Satan makes mistakes - that\u0027s why he rules in Hell after all, instead of in Heaven. And Satan made a real whopper of a mistake this time.\n \"What\u0027s that? Yes, I hear you. I hear what you\u0027re saying. You\u0027re saying, \u0027A pregnant sim, Reverend Eckert? How can that be? Who is the father?\u0027 \"And that, brothers and sisters, is the worst part. This was no immaculate conception. No, this is an abomination. This sim pregnancy is the result of un-plumbed wickedness and moral decrepitude. For the father, I say to you, the father of this sim\u0027s baby ishuman!\n \"Of course, I use the term loosely, for what sort of human would defile himself so by doing such a thing to a helpless animal? But yes, you heard correctly, the father is human!\n \"Now, I know what you\u0027re saying in your hearts, if you\u0027re not crying it out loud, \u0027Why, Reverend Eckert? Why would God allow such an unspeakable thing to occur?\u0027 And I must tell you, friends, that I asked myself the same question. I wondered if this could be a sign of the End Times: Could the child of this unholy union be the Antichrist?\n \"But the Lord his own self was guiding my thoughts because I suddenly realized that this unborn child is just the opposite of the Antichrist. For it will notbe born to establish Satan\u0027s rule on earth, but to dislodge his foul foothold, destroy the satanic beachhead we know as SinGen!\n \"That is therealreason the company is offering so much to find this poor, mistreated, pregnant sim.\n \"So I say to you, my brothers and sisters, do not listen when you are told that this can\u0027t be true, that it\u0027s just another urban legend. It isnot!If you live in the Northeast, live anywhere in or around New York City, I beg you, as soon as I am finished here: Leave your homes and hie into the streets to look for this unfortunate creature.\n \"And if you find her, do not call SinGen, no matter how much money it is offering. Do not allow yourselves to be tempted by the devil\u0027s offer. Sell this sim and you are selling your soul. Instead, call the number flashing at the bottom of your screen and I will personally see to it that this sim and its child are protected from Satan\u0027s forces.\n \"And when the child is born, I shall bring it to the halls of Congress and display it to the leaders of our nation. And then the scales shall fall from their eyes and they will see that they have allowed an abomination to move into their house; and the shackles shall loosen from their limbs and they will act, casting SinGen into the outer darkness whence it came, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n \"Go now, my brothers and sisters. Fill the streets. Waste not another moment. Find - \"\n The screen went blank. Another touch on the desktop and the lights came up.\n Luca blinked, momentarily mute with shock. He opened his mouth to speak but Sinclair voiced his thoughts.\n \"He knows! How thehell did he find out?\"\n \"A leak,\" Luca said. \"I\u0027ve suspected one for some time now.\"\n \"You think the room is bugged? By someone other than you, I mean.\"\n Luca was taken aback by the casualness of the remark.\n \"What?\" Sinclair said, a tiny smile twisting his lips. \"You think I don\u0027t know your people have this office bugged? Probably the whole campus as well, am I right?\"\n He was. Offices, labs, even rest rooms - all bugged. Luca shrugged it off.\n \"We sweep this office regularly. No listening devices of any sort.\" Other than ours.\n \"Ifound out yesterday,\" Sinclair said, then pointed to the blank TV screen. \"Heknows today. How else but a bug?\"\n \"A person. I\u0027ve long suspected your brother. This confirms it.\"\n \"It confirms nothing of the sort. Ellis? Ridiculous!\"\n \"Really? Until yesterday, only a select few of our people knew. Even the men I\u0027ve had combing the city don\u0027t know; they think we want this sim because she\u0027s got a rare immune globulin in her blood. Weeks of searching without a hint of a leak. But yesterday afternoon I tell you and your brother, and today, just twenty-four hours later, the Reverend Eckert is telling the world. If it\u0027s not your brother, then it\u0027s you.\"\n Sinclair sat down and drummed his fingers on the desk. \"Well, it\u0027s not me. And I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s Ellis, not after the way your people threatened his children.\"\n \"I\u0027m not aware of any threat.\"\n \"No? Well, I guess it was before your time.\"\n That part was true. But Luca knew perfectly well what the CEO was talking about. A brilliant little op, involving nothing overt, but it had kept Ellis Sinclair in line ever since.\n Sinclair looked at him. \"Maybe Eckert did have a revelation.\"\n \"You don\u0027t really expect - \"\n \"I don\u0027t mean from God.\"\n \"Then - \"\n \"Hear me out. Here\u0027s this guy who\u0027s got a hard-on for SimGen. He hears we\u0027re offering five million to find this lost sim, so he figures out the worstcase scenario for us, and broadcasts it. It\u0027s just a coincidence that he happens to hit on the truth.\"\n Luca snorted. \"You don\u0027t believe that any more than I do.\"\n Sinclair sighed. \"No. No, I don\u0027t.\"\n \"However Eckert came to it, we can count on a lot of his people on the streets looking for that sim, trying to find her first.\"\n \"Does that worry you, Mr. Portero? Don\u0027t let it. The more the merrier. Eckert\u0027s people merely increase our chances. They may believe in God, but when it comes down to five million dollars\u0027 worth of cold hard cash, they\u0027ll believe in that even more.\"\n \"We\u0027ll see.\" Luca wasn\u0027t so sure about that, but saw no point in arguing. He had another point to press. \"In the meantime, my people will expect you to do something about your brother.\"\n \"Very well. From now on, any meetings concerning matters of a sensitive nature will be conducted without him.\" His eyes narrowed. \"But you don\u0027t have any hard evidence against Ellis, do you. Otherwise you wouldn\u0027t have looked so shocked when I played you that tape. I\u0027d be surprised if you weren\u0027t monitoring his calls. Have you been following him as well?\"\n \"No. But we will.\"\n Truth was, he\u0027d set tails on Sinclair-2 a number of times but they always lost him. Looked like he\u0027d have to tail him personally.\n I can spread myself only so thin, damn it.\n \"Starting when? Tonight?\"\n \"No, not tonight. But soon.\"\n He had a more pressing matter to attend to. He and Lister had spent much of the day setting up an op for tonight. The target, Romy Cadman, knew Luca\u0027s face so he could not be directly involved, but he\u0027d be on standby, eagerly awaiting the results. By the end of the night he\u0027d have established a solid link of money and information between Cadman and Ellis Sinclair.\n And then there\u0027d be no need to follow anyone anywhere. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-58.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: \n Sims (Sims complete) \n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees.
