That was what they\u0027d expect him to do, only this time he wouldn\u0027t.\n \"Everyone take a floor, take a hall, go from room to room. Look for a baby, a newborn baby girl.\"\n Luca kicked back through the operating room doors and grabbed the old guard by his collar. \"The nursery! Where\u0027s the nursery?\"\n \"Th-third floor,\" the old man cried, cringing.\n \"Take me there!\"\n A few minutes later he was standing before a plate-glass window, staring at the rows of bassinets, only half a dozen of them occupied. To his right a frightened new mother cried out and asked him what was wrong. He ignored her.\n These babies, all so human looking. But that didn\u0027t mean the sim baby couldn\u0027t be among them. No way to tell. The safest thing would be to kill all the girls, but he didn\u0027t know if he could do such a thing.\n Movement on the screen of the monitor over the nurse\u0027s station at the rear of the nursery caught his eye. The sim operation film...the one Lowery had supposedly shot up...it was still playing. Suddenly the film cut off and a man appeared. Luca knew that face...the Reverend Eckert! Somehow he\u0027d got hold of the film. Eckert was broadcasting it all over the world!\n Luca turned and began a stumbling trot back toward the elevators. Only one thing to do now.\n Run. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-103.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: \n Sims (Sims complete) \n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
