She checked the readout:\\n\\n GARAGE 10AM\u0026Oslash;\\n\\n She was glad for the change from the Worth Street basement. Use one place too often and eventually the wrong person was going to make the right connection. She and Patrick hopped a cab to the West Side.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see a garage,\" Patrick said as they stepped out onto Ninth Avenue in the Thirties.\\n\\n He noticed the sidewalks were busy here, but nowhere near as crowded as the midtown madhouse a few blocks east.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s down the street, closer to Tenth. But let\u0027s stand here awhile. Just to be sure no one followed us.\"\\n\\n The sun had poked through the clouds but did little to moderate the chill wind whistling off the Hudson.\\n\\n \"Do you ever ask yourself if you\u0027re crazy?\" Patrick said, looking around as if expecting to see trench- coated men lurking in doorways.\\n\\n \"All the time.\"\\n\\n \"Good. That\u0027s a healthy sign. Because I think we\u0027re both crazy.\"\\n\\n \"I think I know where this is going.\"\\n\\n \"Do you? Great. Then maybe you can tell me why we\u0027re at the beck and call of this guy. Who is he? What\u0027s driving him? Why\u0027s he doing this? What\u0027s in it for him?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t answer all your questions,\" she told Patrick, \"but I can tell you why he\u0027s doing it: to stop the slave trade of sentient beings.\"\\n\\n \"But what\u0027s in it for him?\"\\n\\n \"Cessation of the slave trade of sentient beings.\"\\n\\n \"Bull. Idealistic crap.\"\\n\\n The words stung Romy. \"You don\u0027t believe people can be motivated by ideals?\"\\n\\n \"Foot soldiers can be, and they often are. But not the generals, not the guys running the war. They\u0027ve got something else driving them, whether it\u0027s a better place in history or a spot closer to their god or riches or fame or glory or power or revenge or guilt; there\u0027s always something in it for them.\"\\n\\n \"What about Gandhi? Schindler? Father Damien? Mother Teresa?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"Everyone in the world knows their names. Maybe that\u0027s what they were after.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad I\u0027m not you,\" she said. \"What an awful way to view life.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027ve seen too many so-called idealists caught with their hands in the till.\"\\n\\n \"A corrupt individual doesn\u0027t corrupt the ideal.\"\\n\\n \"No argument there, and I didn\u0027t bring this up to start one. But look at the situation. Here\u0027s a guy who has to have spent a fortune setting up this nameless organization to stop SimGen, and then he hides his identity from everyone who works for him. I can see him not trusting me, but what about you? You say you\u0027ve worked with him for years. He\u0027s got to know you\u0027re in this for the long run. Why doesn\u0027t he let you see his face?\"\\n\\n \"How do you know he hasn\u0027t?\" she shot back.\\n\\n Patrick\u0027s eyebrows jumped. \"Has he?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"See what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe he\u0027s someone we\u0027d recognize.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, there\u0027s a thought. You know...he seems to be built a lot like David Letterman.\"\\n\\n Romy wasn\u0027t going to dignify that with a response.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s walk,\" she said, satisfied that no one was on their tail.\\n\\n \"Seriously, though, I\u0027d feel a lot better about this Zero guy if I knew what makes his motor run.\" Patrick seemed to be in summation mode as they headed toward Tenth Avenue, walking sideways, the wind ruffling his blond hair as he gestured with his hands. \"If it\u0027s because a SimGen truck ran over his mother when he was a kid, fine. Or if he\u0027s got huge short positions on SimGen stock, fine. Or even if it\u0027s because of something crazy like Mercer Sinclair stole his girlfriend in seventh grade, okay too. I just want to know so I can have a handle on how much he\u0027ll risk to get what he wants. Because so far we\u0027re the ones in the line of fire, not him. He wasn\u0027t in my car when it was run off the Saw Mill. He wasn\u0027t at Beacon Ridge when the sims offered to share their poisoned food with us.\"\\n\\n Romy hated to admit it, but Patrick was making sense. She\u0027d been taken with Zero from their first meeting. She\u0027d sensed the fire burning beneath all his layers of disguise, and had been warmed by its heat. But what fueled that fire? It was a question she\u0027d never asked. She\u0027d assumed it burned the same as her own, an all-consuming desire to right a wrong. Was that foolish? Perhaps. But she had to go with what she felt.\\n\\n \"All I can tell you,\" she said, \"is that I believe in his cause and he\u0027s never let me down. I don\u0027t intend to let him down.\"\\n\\n He sighed. \"Fair enough. I\u0027m trusting your judgment. For now.\"\\n\\n Down near Tenth, Romy stopped before a dirty white doorway next to an equally dirty white roll-up garage door and pressed a buzzer. She glanced up into the eye of an overhead security camera and nodded once, signaling that all was clear. The door buzzed open.\\n\\n Inside, a single dusty bulb glowed in the ceiling. They found Zero, barely visible in the gloom, his tall lean figure swathed in sweater, jeans, ski mask, dark glasses, and gloves, pacing beside a beat-up Ford Econoline delivery van, once white, now soot gray.\\n\\n \"Have you heard any more about this SLA group?\" he said without preamble.\\n\\n Romy sensed the tension in his voice.\\n\\n \"Nothing. I called a few of the cops I know but nothing\u0027s broken yet beyond the identity of the corpse in the ashes: Craig Strickland, a twenty-four-year-old loser with a history of assaults.\"\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t sound like your typical globulin farmer.\"\\n\\n \"They figure he was security. He may have tried to resist. As for the SLA, an all-points has been issued but they and their captives seem to have vanished.\"\\n\\n \"Two vans filled with human and sim hostages and no one\u0027s seen a thing?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet.\"\\n\\n Zero slammed a gloved fist against the already dented side of the van.\\n\\n \"Damn! Whoare these psychos? What do they hope to accomplish for sims by murdering humans? Not that the world is any poorer for the loss of a globulin farmer, but killing him shifts the focus. The public\u0027s attention is on the murder now, not on the sims the dead man was abusing.\"\\n\\n \"Pardon my paranoia,\" Patrick said, \"but maybe that\u0027s the whole point. Maybe these aren\u0027t sim sympathizers. Maybe SimGen is behind them.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t buy that,\" Zero said, \"but let\u0027s assume SimGen has somehow come to the conclusion that the gains from high-profile murder will, by some stretch of the imagination, outweigh the risks. If that\u0027s true, and if they\u0027re going to spray paint \u0027Death to sim oppressors\u0027 at the scene, then why kill only one of the globulin farmers? Why not make a real statement and kill them all?\"\\n\\n \"Hostages?\"\\n\\n Zero\u0027s expression was unreadable behind his mask and shades, but Romy could imagine a dour look as he stopped his pacing and faced Patrick.\\n\\n \"How many people can you see stepping forward to pay a globulin farmer\u0027s ransom?\"\\n\\n Patrick shrugged. \"Okay. So much for the hostage idea.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Death to sim oppressors!\u0027\" Zero said, slamming his fist against the van again. \"Damn them! Idiots!\"\\n\\n Romy had never seen him show so much emotion. She found it oddly exciting.\\n\\n Down, girl, she told herself as she pulled her digital camera\u0027s chip case from her pocket.\\n\\n She said, \"I may have another piece to add to the puzzle. I took a shot of an Asian man - Japanese, I think - at the scene. He ducked away as soon as he saw the camera. I\u0027ve never seen him before, and it may mean nothing, but he was definitely camera shy.\"\\n\\n Zero seemed to have calmed himself. He took the chip. \"I\u0027ll see if he\u0027s anyone we should know about.\"\\n\\n \"But what\u0027s the plan?\" she said. \"What do we do about this SLA?\"\\n\\n \"No choice but to wait and see. I doubt we\u0027ll have much of a wait. A group like that won\u0027t want to stay out of the headlines. But in the meantime, we\u0027re ready to make our move against Manassas Ventures.\"\\n\\n Romy stiffened. \"When?\"\\n\\n \"Monday, first thing in the morning. Are you up for it?\"\\n\\n Monday...she\u0027d have to take a personal day.\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t looking forward to this. It involved playing a role, pretending she was a kind of person she despised. She hoped she could bring it off.\\n\\n Zero\u0027s dark lenses were trained on her. \"Something wrong?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t want to let him in on her apprehensions. He had enough on his plate.\\n\\n \"I just keep thinking about those sims.\" And that was no lie. \"Whoever these SLA people are, I hope they\u0027re taking good care of them.\"\\n\\n \"Amen to that,\" Zero muttered. He shook his head. \"\u0027Free the sims.\u0027 Don\u0027t they understand? Sims have never been allowed to learn to fend for themselves. A free sim isn\u0027t free at all. It\u0027s a lost soul.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-38.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) \\n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech.

It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \\n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect.
