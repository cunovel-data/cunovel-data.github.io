He didn\u0027t have to worry about anyone hearing; security staff was minimal on Sundays. Luca hadn\u0027t seen the bodies yet, but Lowery, who\u0027d found them, had told them that both their skulls had been cracked like eggs. That sounded eerily similar to the way Ricker and Green had bought it off the Saw Mill. But this was in broad daylight, damn it! Could things get any fucking worse? As if in answer to his question, the secure phone rang. He hesitated - because, yes, things could get a lot worse - then answered it. He repressed a sigh of relief when he heard Lowery\u0027s hello. \"What?\" \"I\u0027ve been checking around the area and found some squatters in this broke down old apartment house on the same block.\" \"Did they see anything?\" \"Not what happened to Snyder and Grimes, but they did see this black van parked on the street - \" \"They\u0027re sure it was black?\" \"Double-checked that. They swear it was black. But here\u0027s the meat: the one looking out the window says she saw a very swollen looking female sim being led into the black van.\" Oh, no! No! They\u0027ve found her! Snatched her right out from under our noses! How the fuck could this happen? \"She\u0027s absolutely sure?\" \"No question.\" \"Who was doing the leading?\" \"Two men - one \u0027very strange looking,\u0027 according to her, but she was kinda vague about that - along with a woman, and another sim, an old male.\" Luca dropped into his desk chair and cradled his head in his free hand. Cadman and Sullivan. Had to be. Plus that old sim Sullivan kept around, and someone else working with them. And they had the pregnant sim. \"All right,\" Luca said, straightening. This wasn\u0027t FUBAR yet. It still could be salvageable. \"We abandon Newark. Divide the remaining men into four teams: one on Sullivan\u0027s apartment, one on his office, one on Cadman\u0027s apartment, one on her office. You see them, grab them.\" \"But - \" \"I don\u0027t care what you have to do to nab them, just get it done. If there\u0027s any flack we\u0027ll straighten it out later. I want one of those shits and I want them brought to me!\" He\u0027d interrogate them personally and they\u0027d lead him to this pregnant sim. No need to worry about being recognized because whoever he dealt with would not be leaving vertically. But what if they\u0027d all gone to ground?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-85.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
