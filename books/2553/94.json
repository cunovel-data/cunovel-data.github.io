{"id":111845,"no":94,"title":"Page 94","content":"MINEOLA, NY The racket - footsteps in the upstairs hallway, a fist pounding on a door, Betsy\u0027s voice shouting - startled Romy awake. She found herself up and moving without knowing how or why. \"Wake up! Patrick! Romy! It\u0027s time! We\u0027ve got to go!\" Go? Where? She pulled open her door and caught Betsy as she hurried by. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"Meerm\u0027s in hard labor. We can\u0027t hold off any longer. Got to get her to the hospital right now!\" Romy saw Patrick stick his head out of his room and called to him. \"Did you hear?\" He nodded blearily. \"What time is it?\" \"Three-twenty!\" Betsy cried, moving away. \"Get dressed. We\u0027ve got to move!\" Romy jumped into her clothes and was down the stairs in seconds, Patrick right behind her. They dashed to Betsy\u0027s bedroom where they found a very confused and frightened Meerm lying on a cot and wrapped in blankets. \"Patrick, you carry her,\" Betsy said as she yanked the spread and blankets off her own bed. \"We\u0027ll fix up the car.\" Romy followed her to the garage where they flattened the rear seats in the Volvo and spread out the bedclothes. Patrick appeared a moment later carrying the moaning Meerm. They nestled her in the rear section. \"Patrick, you drive,\" Betsy said. \"Do you know the way to the hospital?\" \"No.\" \"I\u0027ll direct you, then. Romy, you stay here in the back with me.\" And then they were on their way, Betsy and Romy kneeling on either side of Meerm in the back as Patrick pulled out of the driveway. Romy opened her PCA and left a beeper message for Zero: \"It\u0027s happening. We\u0027re on our way to the hospital.\" As she hung up she heard Betsy on her own PCA. \"...know it\u0027s Christmas, Joanna, but this is more than just an emergency section, it\u0027s an historical event...I wish I could say more than that, but I can\u0027t. Have I ever lied to you? Well then, believe me, Joanna, youwant to be part of this. Okay, good. I\u0027ll see you there.\" As Betsy hung up and punched in another speed-dial code, she glanced at Romy and smiled. \"My surgical team. A dedicated bunch, but itis Christmas Day. My nurse anesthetist is Hindu, so she\u0027ll be no problem; but both my scrub nurses have small children.\" She shrugged. \"One\u0027s coming. I hope I can persuade the other. If not...do you faint at the sight of blood, Romy?\" \"Me?\" Romy said, caught off guard. \"No, I\u0027m okay with blood. But if you\u0027re talking about assisting on a surgery...I don\u0027t think...\" \"Let\u0027s hope you won\u0027t have to, but be prepared. I may need you.\" Slice open Meerm\u0027s belly? Romy didn\u0027t know if she could help with that.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-94.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
