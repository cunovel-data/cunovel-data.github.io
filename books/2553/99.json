But for that he needed to know where the exits were, and the place to find out was Information. As they stormed into the dimly lit, high-ceilinged lobby he found the reception desk empty; the entire population was two gray-haired ladies and an aging security guard clustered before a TV monitor fixed on a wall. He hurried over to grab the guard but stopped dead when he saw what they were watching. Four humans operating on a pregnant sim. The guard turned, saw them, and stumbled backward, reaching for his two-way. Luca reached out and grabbed his arm. \"FBI!\" He shouted and pointed to the monitor. \"Take us to that operating room!\" \"W-wait,\" the guard said. \"You can\u0027t just come in here and - \" Luca squeezed his arm. Hard.\"Now!\" He shoved him toward a hallway.\"Move!\" As the cowed guard led them toward a bank of elevators, Luca turned to Stritch and pointed toward the old ladies. \"You stay here. Keep them away from the phones.\" Behind his visor Luca repressed a sigh of relief. No need to worry about covering the exits. The baby hadn\u0027t been born yet.

Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
