He\u0027d been out in the woods surrounding his cabin, taking some fresh morning air, taking precautions...the way things were going, precautions might come in handy. The news didn\u0027t surprise him.\\n\\n \"How?\"\\n\\n \"Broken neck. His body was found around 5:00A .M. A red flag went up at our end when NYPD tried to run his prints this morning. They\u0027ve got him listed as a John Doe and he\u0027ll remain that way.\"\\n\\n \"What about Palmer?\"\\n\\n \"Not a peep. And that worries me more. I\u0027d almost prefer to have his corpse surface.\"\\n\\n Luca knew what Lister meant. An experienced operative caught in the act while carrying a supply of Totuus was a recipe for disaster. But Luca had taken precautions for just this eventuality.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re protected,\" Luca said. \"I had him and Jackson down a dose of MTW before they went out.\"\\n\\n \"Thank God for that. How did you ever convince them to take it?\"\\n\\n \"I told them they had no choice, that it was a direct order from the Old Man himself.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky they believed you. Still...MTW is still pretty new. Not much field experience with it. Better pray it worked. Because if it didn\u0027t...\"\\n\\n Lister didn\u0027t finish the sentence. Didn\u0027t have to. If the MTW had failed, Palmer would have spilled everything by now.\\n\\n The MTWdid work, Luca thought. Ithad to.\\n\\n \"But even if it works perfectly,\" Lister went on, \"you\u0027re not off the hook for muffing another operation. And neither am I.\"\\n\\n \"We didn\u0027t muff athing !\" Luca said as a cold lump formed in his belly. \"The Idaho hotshots blew it.\"\\n\\n \"The people upstairs don\u0027t see it that way. They\u0027re out four skilled operatives in two months with nothing to show for it. And they keep asking me, \u0027Where\u0027s the pregnant sim? All our resources at your disposal, a five-million-dollar reward for information leading to her, and what have you come up with?\u0027 Do you hear what they\u0027re saying, Luca? It used to be, \u0027When\u0027s Portero coming up with something?\u0027 Now it\u0027s, \u0027When areyou coming up with something?\u0027 Me. Like we\u0027re Siamese twins.\"\\n\\n Luca thought he heard a tremor in Lister\u0027s voice. He\u0027d never known Darryl Lister to be scared. When they\u0027d been pinned down by Taliban mortars outside Gardez, he\u0027d been the picture of cool. But now...\\n\\n \"Shit. I\u0027m sorry, man.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, we\u0027re not dead yet. We\u0027ve gotten out of tighter places. But they want results by the end of the year.\"\\n\\n The end of the year - two weeks!\\n\\n Luca said, \"What about the plate number Snyder spotted on that van last night?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing. He must have got it wrong. The number\u0027s not in use. Tell Snyder he needs glasses.\"\\n\\n Luca didn\u0027t think so. More likely the plates were phony, and Palmer and Jackson had been in that van along with Cadman, Sullivan, and who knew who else.\\n\\n \"All right then,\" Luca said. \"What\u0027s the status of Cadman and Sullivan now? Do we keep after them?\"\\n\\n \"The decision\u0027s been made to back off for the time being. They\u0027ll be on guard now and - \"\\n\\n \"Obviously they werealready on guard.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, well, be that as it may, they\u0027ll be on full alert now, and we can\u0027t risk losing any more men. The legal people can put the stall on any discovery motions Sullivan files; we\u0027ll find out who\u0027s behind them later. Right now concentrate on finding that sim.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s possible she\u0027s dead,\" Luca said, hoping it was true. \"That cold snap after she escaped was pretty mean. She could have crawled into a pipe somewhere and froze to death.\"\\n\\n \"Then find her body. Since that fool Eckert started blathering about her being pregnant and the baby\u0027s father being human, SimGen stock price has slid six points. Most people think he\u0027s crazy, but he\u0027s making a lot of investors nervous. And that makes everyone upstairs nervous. You know what SimGen stock means.\"\\n\\n Luca nodded. It meant independence for SIRG. No strings, no brakes.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got to find her, Luca. I don\u0027t have to tell you what will happen if Eckert or Cadman and Sullivan get to her first.\"\\n\\n Luca closed his eyes. That would finish SimGen, finish SIRG, and leave him running for his life.\\n\\n \"They won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n And to make sure they wouldn\u0027t, he had to nail Ellis Sinclair as their informant and serve up his head on a silver platter. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-62.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) \\n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \\n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \\n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \\n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
