He was nearly finished packing up the books in his office. Strangely enough, he wasn\u0027t the least bit sad about leaving Payes \u0026 Hecht. And from the cool reception he\u0027d received in the hallways, he gathered the feeling was mutual. Only Maggie seemed genuinely sorry to see him go. She was out now, scrounging up more boxes for him, so there\u0027d been no one to intercept his visitor. He saw a thin, aging woman in a faded blue flowered dress and a rumpled red cardigan sweater. She wore a yellow scarf around her head, babushka style, and clutched a battered black handbag before her with both her bony hands. Her pale hazel eyes peered at him and she nodded vigorously. \"Yes, you\u0027re him,\" she said. \"I recognize you from the TV.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am?\" he said. \"Can I help you, Ms....?\" \"Fredericks.Miss Alice Fredericks.\" She offered a smile that might have been girlish had she possessed more teeth. \"I wish to retain your services, Mr. Sullivan.\" The poor woman didn\u0027t look like she had enough for her next meal. Not that it mattered. He was no longer with the firm. \"I\u0027m afraid I - \" \"I want you to sue SimGen for me. I can tell you\u0027re a brave man. You\u0027re taking on the company on behalf of those poor dear sims, so I figure you\u0027re just the man, in fact theonly man with the guts to tackle them for me.\" This was interesting. \"That\u0027s very gratifying. On what grounds would you wish me to tackle them, may I ask?\" Her face screwed up, accentuating her wrinkles, and she looked as if she was about to cry. \"They took my baby!\" she wailed. Baby? Patrick stared at her. A warning bell clanged in his brain. SimGen might have some skeletons in its corporate closets, but he doubted stealing babies was one of them. And this woman was long, long past the baby-bearing years. \"When did this happen?\" She sobbed. \"Years and years ago! I...I\u0027m not sure how many. Things get fuzzy...\" \"Why have you waited so long to go after them?\" \"I\u0027ve been to every lawyer in New York City and no one will take the case. They\u0027re all afraid!\" \"I find that hard to believe, Miss Fredericks. There are literally thousands of lawyers in the city who would get in line to sue SimGen.\" \"Sure...until they hear about the space aliens.\" Oh, Christ. No need for a warning bell anymore. There it was, right out on the table: a big, multicolored bull\u0027s-eye withLooney Tunes scrawled across it. Patrick didn\u0027t want to ask but had to. \"Aliens?\" \"Yes. Space aliens abducted me, impregnated me, and then when I delivered, it was a sim. But I loved him anyway. That didn\u0027t matter, though. They took my baby boy away from me. And do you know who they handed him to? Right in front of me? Mercer Sinclair! Mercer Sinclair took my baby and I want him back!\" She sobbed again. She wasn\u0027t scamming. Patrick had a sensitive bullshit meter and it wasn\u0027t even twitching. This poor woman believed every word. \"I sympathize, Miss Fredericks, but - \" \"And you know what Mercer Sinclair did with my son, don\u0027t you? He made the whole race of sims from him. And he did it for the aliens so that earth can be repopulated by a slave race that the aliens can use around the galaxy.\" Patrick blinked. A living breathing talking issue ofWeekly World News had walked into his office. It might be funny if the woman weren\u0027t so genuinely upset. And he might be tempted to sit down and listen to her - purely for entertainment - if he didn\u0027t have such a burning need to put this place behind him. \"Tell you what, Miss Fredericks. I\u0027m leaving the firm, so I won\u0027t be able to help you. But you could try one of the firm\u0027s associates. I suggest you go down the hall and find Mr. Richard Berger\u0027s office and tell him your story. And tell him I referred you.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. I\u0027ll do that right now.\" That should teach Berger to call him Sim-Sim Sullivan.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-24.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
