Beece hear talk. \"I\u0027m from the city Animal Control Center, Mr. Lachter.\" \"Hey, I treat my sims good.\" \"No, Mr. Lachter, that would fall under the auspices of the ASPCA. We have a different mandate, and at the moment we\u0027re looking for a lost sim.\" Beece almost leave sink, now stay. Lost sim? Could be Meerm? Listen more. \"I got all mine. I count \u0027em every morning. None missing, no extras.\" \"Good. But from past experience we know that lost sims tend to seek out other sims, so we\u0027d greatly appreciate it if you\u0027d keep your eye out for any sim that might wander in.\" Boss laugh. \"He does, I\u0027ll put him to work!\" \"It\u0027s a female and if she shows up you should isolate her immediately.\" \"Why\u0027s that?\" \"She may be sick. Nothing contagious to humans, but she might infect other sims.\" Infect? Beece think. What mean infect? \"I don\u0027t need none of that. I can barely make production quotas now.\" \"If she shows she may look a little different than the average sim and - \" \"Different? What is she, a new breed?\" \"No. Same as the rest, but she might look a little heavier...perhaps \u0027bloated\u0027 is a better term. She\u0027s sick and we can take care of her, but we have to find her first.\" Meerm! Man talk about Meerm! Meerm sick but fraid doctor. Beece feel sorry Meerm. City Man want help Meerm. No hurt Meerm. Beece fraid talk Boss. Boss yell all time. But Meerm Beece friend. Must help Meerm. Beece step in office. \"\u0027Scuse, please, boss.\" Boss face go mad. \"What the hell you doing here! Get back to work, you lazy - \" \"No, wait,\" red-hair city man say. He look Beece. \"Do you know something?\" \"Sick sim come home.\" \"Home? Where\u0027s home?\" \"I crib them in Newark overnight,\" Boss say. \"Newark? Why so far?\" \"Because it\u0027s tons cheaper to bus them back and forth than rent space for them around here. Sorry if that\u0027s out of your jurisdiction, pal, but - \" \"Oh, don\u0027t you worry about that. Just give me the address of this place. I\u0027ll take it from there.\" Beece happy. Red-hair city man nice. Help Meerm. Make Meerm better.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-51.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
