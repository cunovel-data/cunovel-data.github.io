Says he\u0027s got the pregnant sim.\"\n \"Sure. Him and half a million others.\"\n Luca shook his head. How many times had he heard that since the fivemegabuck reward hit the news? People were crawling out of the woodwork with crazy stories, some wishful thinking, others outright lies. Meerm, or an equally pregnant sim, had been sighted in Chicago, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, London, Hong Kong. The world was suddenly full of pregnant sims.\n \"This Morales says he met you at the Newark crib when you came looking for the pregnant sim; says she\u0027s been hiding there right under his nose all along.\"\n Luca remembered Morales now, a quick, jittery little ferret of a man. Remembered that damn crib too. After a weeklong fruitless vigil, he\u0027d yanked surveillance from the place, figuring if the pregnant sim hadn\u0027t returned by then, she wasn\u0027t coming back at all.\n But if she\u0027d never left the building in the first place...\n \"Put him though.\"\n Luca\u0027s hand darted toward the phone and hovered over the receiver. He let it ring twice before picking up.\n A few minutes later, after listening to Morales\u0027s story, Luca hung up and jabbed the intercom button. \"Nowicki. Get Grimes and Alessi. Meet me in the garage. We\u0027re rolling!\"\n This was it. Morales\u0027s story hung together too well to be anything but the real thing.\n We\u0027ve found her!\n Luca felt as if a magnum of Dom Perignom had popped open inside his chest.\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-69.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: \n Sims (Sims complete) \n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
