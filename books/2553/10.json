He toyed idly with the ExecSec plant on his desktop, brushing his pen against the leaves and watching its tendrils whip around the shaft and hold it in place. Then he\u0027d tug on the pen and the tendrils would release it. Back and forth, give and take, noting with pleasure how the plant rotated use of its tendrils to avoid fatigue. He sighed and let the plant keep the pen as he leaned back in his chair. The ExecSec had been a modest success back in the days before SinclairGen became SimGen. He wished they\u0027d stuck to harmless little gimmicky products like this instead of going for the killer app. They wouldn\u0027t be fractionally as wealthy, but how much money can you spend? And there\u0027d be no sims wandering the earth. He rubbed his cold palms together. The artificial sunlight streaming through the frosted panes at his back did nothing to warm him. More and more lately he craved a real window. Just one. But that was out of the question. Basic research\u0027s windowless design was his own doing, for he knew as well as anyone that a window to the outside was also a portal in. So he had allowed not a pinhole through the walls of this lead-lined box of steel-reinforced concrete. To keep the place from looking too much like the Berlin Wall, mirror-glass panes had been set into the exterior to simulate windows and, perhaps, to tempt industrial and media spies to bounce the beams of their snoop lasers off the glass in vain attempts to hear what was being said on the other side. Ellis could not allow anyone to know the reasons behind what he was doing here. Not even his assistants knew. Only Mercer. And then there was the sealed section, with its separate staff who were ferried in and ferried out with no one ever seeing them. If the truth about either ever leaked... He shuddered. He heard the door open and looked up to see Harry step through, followed by a handler leading a young male sim by the hand. He\u0027d asked Harry to bring in the highest scoring sim from the latest batch of the special breed. \"Here he is,\" Harry said. \"F27-63 - at your service. We call him Seymour.\" He turned to the handler. \"I\u0027ll take him now.\" The handler stepped out. Harry Carstairs, chief of sim education, had trained more of the creatures than anyone else presently with the company; a big man, six-four at least, and probably weighing in at an eighth of a ton. He towered over the sim. Ellis glanced down at his desktop memo screen. F27-63 - yes, that was Seymour\u0027s serial number. He had longer arms and looser lips than the average commercial sim. Smaller too. \"All right,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s see what he can do.\" \"Sit in the red chair, Seymour,\" Harry said gently. He stood with his hands clasped in front of him, staring straight ahead as he spoke, allowing the sim no hints or cues from his body language. The sim looked around, spotted the dark red leather chair against the wall, and loped over to seat himself. \"Good. Now turn on the lamp on the opposite side of the room.\" The sim rose, crossed in front of Ellis\u0027s desk, and stopped before the lamp. He looked under the shade, found the switch, and turned it on. \"Very good,\" Harry said. \"Now - \" \"I\u0027m satisfied with his comprehension,\" Ellis said. Comprehension had never been the problem; he was anxious to cut to the chase. \"What about his speech?\" \"It\u0027s getting there.\" \"Gettingthere?\" \"He\u0027s a great signer.\" \"I\u0027m sure he is.\" Sims started ASL lessons in infancy because signing stimulated development of the speech cortex; this helped enormously with vocalization later on. \"Want to see him sign?\" \"No,\" Ellis said, balling a fist in frustration. \"I want to hear him speak.\" He turned to the sim. \"What is your name?\" The creature looked at Harry who nodded encouragement. The sim\u0027s thick pink tongue protruded between his yellow teeth as he said, \"Thee...\" in a low-pitched voice. Ellis was about to say that \"Thee\" wasn\u0027t a name when the sim continued, laboriously pronouncing, \"Mmmm...mmmm...\" And then he seemed to run out of gas. He glanced uncertainly at Harry who smiled and nodded. \"You\u0027re doing good. Go on.\" \"Mmmm...,\" said Seymour, picking up where he\u0027d left off. But he seemed stuck on the sound. Ellis held up a hand. \"All right. He can\u0027t say his name. Whatcan he say?\" Harry turned to the sim. \"Did you have breakfast?\" The sim nodded. \"Eth.\" \"Are you hungry now?\" A head shake. \"Oh.\" Ellis waited but gathered from the look on Harry\u0027s face that the show was over. \"That\u0027s it? He\u0027s your best and his entire vocabulary consists of two incomplete words and half his name?\" Ellis tried to keep the anger from his voice - none of this was Harry\u0027s fault - but still he heard it slip through. Because damn it, hewas angry. When was he going to see some results? The sim sensed his emotion and shrank back a step. Harry rested a reassuring hand on the creature\u0027s shoulder. \"Seymour\u0027s doing the best that he can.\" Ellis wanted to beat his fists on his desk and scream,It\u0027s not enough! Notnearly enough! Instead he sighed and leaned back in his swivel chair. \"You don\u0027t work them hard enough.\" Maybe Harry had been around sims too long. An inherently gentle man, maybe he was identifying with them too much, cutting them too much slack. And maybe Harry was thinking about another sim, a special long-ago sim who was gone. \"You\u0027re too easy on them.\" \"What do you want me to do?\" Harry said, his face darkening. \"Whip them?\" \"No, of course not.\" What an awful thought. \"Not Seymour\u0027s fault if his hyoid\u0027s not up to par with the main breed\u0027s.\" The hyoid - always the damn hyoid. The little arch of bone that supported the tongue and its muscles was crucial to human speech. Ellis\u0027s new lines all lacked a fully developed hyoid bone. That wasn\u0027t the only thing not up to par. \"Ever hear of evolutionary synergy, Harry?\" The big man\u0027s brow furrowed. \"I don\u0027t recall...\" \"You wouldn\u0027t have. It\u0027s a new theory I\u0027ve developed as a result of my recent work. It\u0027s the subtle, as yet unquantifiable cooperation between genes that have evolved together. It\u0027s so subtle that I can\u0027t prove it, but I know it\u0027s there, I know it\u0027s true.\" \"What\u0027s that got to do with Seymour?\" Harry said. \"Everything.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"I know.\" He saw Harry glance at the plastic pill organizer on his desk - three compartments labeledAM ,AFT, andPM . Ellis always left it in plain sight, to maintain his image as a heavily medicated eccentric. But the pills were for show. He\u0027d been off medication for quite some time now. Harry led the sim to the door, signaled for the handler, then closed it after them. \"Mr. Sinclair,\" he said, approaching the desk. \"I work your new breeds harder than the main breed, and - \" \"I know you do, Harry.\" Ellis stared at his hands, bunched into fists. \"It\u0027s just that it\u0027s so damn frustrating.\" \"Youthink it\u0027s frustrating? How about for me and my staff? We slave with these new breeds day after day and get nowhere. And we keep asking ourselveswhy ...why does the company keep developing breeds that are inferior to the one we already have?\" Not the company, Ellis thought. Me. Just me. \"I can\u0027t go into that, Harry.\" \"Then can you tell me what\u0027s wrong with the main breed that you want to correct?\" Everything!Ellis wanted to shout.Every fucking thing! \"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t go into that either.\" \"It has something to do with the sealed section then.\" A statement. The sealed section...only a handful of employees in the basic research building knew it existed, and even they didn\u0027t know that most of it was underground. No access through the main areas; the only entry and exit was through an enclosed loading dock on the northwest corner of the building. Sealed staff never mixed with other employees; they ate and slept where they worked, leaving only on weekends in enclosed trucks. This he could answer truthfully. \"No, Harry. It does not.\" Harry stood silent a moment. \"Then what? I would think that I\u0027ve proven myself loyal enough by now to be entrusted - \" \"Please, Harry,\" Ellis said, holding up a hand. \"It\u0027s not a question of trust. It\u0027s a matter of...\" Of what? What could he say? \"A matter of deciding which way the company should go in the future. We haven\u0027t agreed - haven\u0027t decided on which way that will be. But when we do, I assure you, you\u0027ll be the first to know.\" Ellis noted that this seemed to salve Harry\u0027s wounded pride. \"But until then,\" he added, \"bear with the frustration. I promise you, it will be well worth it in the end.\" IfI succeed. Harry\u0027s smile was lopsided. \"I\u0027ll trust you on that.\" Harry left and Ellis was alone with the chrome-framed faces of his children staring at him across the desktop. Robbie and Julie...God, he missed them. Somewhere along the course of his consuming monomania he\u0027d forgotten about them. He didn\u0027t know exactly when he\u0027d metamorphosed from husband and father to something other, something distant...obsessed...a shadow...a ghost drifting through their lives, through his own life as well. But Judy and the kids hadn\u0027t been able to live with what he\u0027d become, and so he\u0027d lost them. He wasn\u0027t bitter though. Just lonely. Didn\u0027t blame Judy. He\u0027d deserved to lose them. But he was working toward getting them back - earningthem back. And when he deserved to have them call him father again, he knew he\u0027d win them back. But not until he\u0027d fixed SimGen.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-10.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
