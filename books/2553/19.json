So, net gain thus far from all this effort is zip. Or maybe I should sayzero - if you\u0027ll pardon the expression.\"\n \"Any time,\" Zero said.\n They had assumed their usual positions in the dank basement under the abandoned storefront on Worth Street: Zero backlit behind the rickety table, swathed in a turtleneck, dark glasses, and a ski mask this time; Romy sitting across from him. She\u0027d walked twice around the block today to assure she hadn\u0027t been followed.\n Romy knew she\u0027d been in a foul mood lately; she\u0027d spent the past couple of weeks snapping at everyone in the office. And with good reason. The organization was getting nowhere with SimGen. Lots of movement but no forward progress. Like jogging on a treadmill.\n And she resented Zero too, with his corny disguise and his secrets and his damned elliptical manner. She could sense him smiling at her behind the layers of cloth hiding his face. She wanted to kick over his crummy folding table, snap his dark glasses, rip off his ski mask, and say, Let\u0027s just cut this melodramatic bullshit and talk face-to-face.\n Usually she didn\u0027t like herself when she fell into this state, but today she relished it. She wanted someone to push her buttons so she could tap dance on a head or two.\n \"But \u0027zero\u0027 isn\u0027t quite accurate,\" he said. \"Your inspections confirmed that SimGen is treating its sims as humanely as advertised.\"\n Romy nodded. That had been the plus side. Though the young sims led a barracks-style life of multilevel bunks and regimented hours, their environment was clean and they were well nourished.\n \"Humanely,\" she said. \"After spending all that time with so many of them, the word has garnered new meaning in respect to sims.\"\n \"How so?\"\n \"Well, so many typical chimp behaviors are missing. The mothers don\u0027t carry their young on their backs like chimps, but on their hips like humans. And I saw only a rare sim grooming another. Chimps are always grooming each other. I\u0027d think if SimGen wanted to keep the public thinking of sims as animals they would have allowedsome chimp behavior to carry over.\"\n \"First off,\" Zero said, \"it could be learned behavior. If they\u0027ve never seen or experienced grooming, they might not do it. Plus, sims don\u0027t have anywhere near the amount of hair as chimps, so it\u0027s not necessary. And if it\u0027s genetically linked behavior, it might have disappeared when SimGen \u0027cleaned up\u0027 the sim genome by removing most of the so-called junk DNA. Or the company might have engineered it out of them because it would interfere with their work efficiency.\"\n \"That last sounds typical. Too bad, because it seems to give chimps comfort.\" Romy shook her head. \"No grooming, no sex, no joy, no aggression, no love, no hate...it\u0027s like they\u0027re half alive - lessthan half. It\u0027s unconscionable. Chimps laugh, they cry, they exhibit loyalty and treachery, they can be loving and murderous, they can be born ambitious, they can fight wars, they can commit infanticide. A mix of the good and the bad, the best and the worst, just like humans. But sims...sims have been stripped of the extremes, pared down to a bland mean to make them workforce fodder.\"\n She closed her eyes a moment to hold back a hot surge of anger. No use getting herself worked up now.\n \"How do sims feel about it?\" Zero asked. \"Ever wonder?\"\n \"All the time. I signed to a lot of the young ones during the inspection tours, asking them just that:How do you feel? andAre you happy? \"\n \"How did they answer?\"\n \"They answered \u0027Okay\u0027 to the first, but they didn\u0027t seem to know what \u0027happy\u0027 meant.\"\n \"Tough concept.\"\n Romy shot to her feet and walked around in a tight circle, grinding a fist against her palm.\n \"Maybe I should quit this.\"\n \"Romy - \"\n \"No, I\u0027m serious. My life is one tangled mass of dissatisfaction. I should quit the organization, put in my time at OPRR, settle down, marry a fellow bureaucrat, buy a house, have kids, and forget all this crap! Life would be so much simpler and I\u0027d be so much happier!\"\n \"Would you?\"\n \"At least I wouldn\u0027t be so damn frustrated!\" You\u0027re losing it, she thought. Keep a lid on it. But she couldn\u0027t. She needed to spew. \"Everywhere I turn, someone\u0027s hiding something from me: couldn\u0027t find anything useful at SimGen, you won\u0027t show me your face or let me in on who else is in the organization. Hell, for all I know, OPRR\u0027s got a secret agenda they\u0027re keeping from me too! I\u0027m sick of it! Sick to death!\"\n Zero said nothing, merely sat and waited for her to cool. Good move.\n With a little more circle walking and fist grinding, the heat seeped away and she dropped back into the chair.\n \"Okay,\" she said. \"I\u0027m back.\"\n \"What can I do to make this better?\"\n \"Nothing. It\u0027s not you, it\u0027s me. I always seem at odds with a world that I should be so thankful for. Look what the genome revolution has done. We\u0027ll all live longer because so many genetic diseases have already been wiped out, and days are numbered for the rest of them. Heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, certain cancers - if they ran in your family you pretty much had to resign yourself to dealing with them at some point in your life. Not these days. Germline therapy has seen to that. Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, MS - hell,nobody has those anymore.\"\n \"Jerry Lewis finally stopped those telethons.\"\n Romy had to smile. \"There you go - something else to be thankful for. And then there\u0027s...me. You know about my splice, I assume.\"\n Zero nodded. \"Changed your life, didn\u0027t it.\"\n Oh, yes, she thought. You might even say it saved my life.\n She remembered adolescence as a time of chaos. Under the influence of the new hormones surging through her maturing body, her childhood fits of violence segued into other modes of acting out. When she was Reasonable Romy she was an A student, but then somewhere in her system a switch would be thrown and Raging Romy would emerge. If Reasonable Romy had a fault, it was that she felt too much, cared too much. Raging Romy cared for no one, least of all herself, and needed to go to extremes to feel anything.\n She stifled a groan as she remembered the reckless sex - she cut a sexual swath through the willing males and females in each of the three high schools she attended, then jumped into drinking, drugs, shoplifting, the whole gamut. When she was caught dancing naked on the roof of the gym she qualified for emergency institutionalization.\n During her time in the locked ward of the hospital, the doctors explained that Reasonable Romy was the real Romy, the only Romy, but at times her neurohormones would undergo wild fluctuations, causing her to act out of character. They said it was a form of what they called bipolar disorder and they had medications that would keep her neurohormones - and thus her behavior - on an even keel.\n Wrong.\n Oh, the drugs worked for a while. She survived high school and her parents\u0027 divorce - Raging Romy\u0027s behavior playing a major part in the breakup - And Got Through College Without too many incidents. During grad school she started noticing increasingly wide mood swings. She managed to earn her Ph.D. in Anthropology, but shortly after that she was out of control.\n A parade of doctors tried a wide array of chemical cocktails to regulate her behavior. No luck. Finally someone suggested a radical new treatment - gene therapy. A defective gene in her brain cells had been identified as the cause of her disorder. Using a viral vector, they could replace the aberrant base sequence in the gene and get it back to normal functioning.\n But no success was guaranteed. The therapy was still experimental in those days. The virus would target only areas of the brain that controlled her serotonin and dopamine levels; if it got to enough cells, the levels would stabilize, normalize. If not...well, there\u0027d been all sorts of releases to sign.\n Apparently the vector virus reached a sufficient number of cells: Raging Romy never showed her face again.\n But she wasn\u0027t gone. She remained in the unspliced cells, whispering, rattling her chains...a ghost in Romy\u0027s machine. And when Reasonable Romy was angry or stressed, she could feel Raging Romy pushing her way to the surface, trying to break through to be reborn.\n And the scary part was, sometimes Romy found herself cheering her on, almost hoping she\u0027d make it. Because she\u0027d felt so damngood when Raging Romy had the wheel.\n \"Yes, it did,\" Romy told Zero. \"I had a genetic defect spliced out of me and I\u0027ve never regretted it. I\u0027m more my own boss because of it. So why aren\u0027t I overjoyed with our brave new world?\"\n Zero said nothing.\n The perfect response, Romy thought. If I don\u0027t know, he sure as hell doesn\u0027t.\n She sighed. \"Anyway, our inspections were satisfactory - as far as they got. But they could be performing vivisection in that basic research building for all we know.\"\n She\u0027d had two ongoing problems to contend with during the inspection tour. Lack of access to basic research had been the major issue. The other had been the relentless come-ons from Luca Portero; the man somehow had developed the notion that he was irresistible to women, and that Romy\u0027s repeated refusals of his invitations to lunch, dinner, and even breakfast were simply her way of playing hard to get.\n She didn\u0027t mention that to Zero. What was the point? OPRR would be locked in court with SimGen for the foreseeable future and she probably wouldn\u0027t see Luca Portero again for a long time, if ever.\n But just thinking about that man only added to her edginess.\n Zero said, \"We\u0027ll let the courts deal with the basic research issue for now. The good news is that after many man-hours of effort by a number a people, we\u0027ve finally hit pay dirt on that license plate number you so wisely recorded - a number we wouldn\u0027t know had you not thrown them a curve by showing up early. A lucky day for us when you joined the organization.\"\n She could feel his praise mellowing her - a little. Always nice to be appreciated, but how sincere was he? Was it that he had sensed her mood and was simply trying to placate her? So damn hard to read him without a glimpse of his face or his eyes. Almost as bad as email. Worse - even email had those annoying little smilies.\n But she remembered his excitement when she\u0027d told him about the plate. He hadn\u0027t been faking that.\n \"About time something paid off,\" she said.\n \"Not a big payday, I\u0027m afraid, but who knows where it will lead. The truck was leased from a firm in Gooding, Idaho, by a private individual named Harold Golden.\"\n \"Really.\" She drew out the word. \"What\u0027s a private individual from Idaho doing on SimGen\u0027s campus?\"\n \"It gets better: Harold Golden\u0027s MasterCard is sound, so the leasing company never checked him out. But we did, and guess what? Harold Golden doesn\u0027t exist. He\u0027s just a name on a credit card account.\"\n \"How can you be sure?\"\n \"Can\u0027t be one hundred percent sure unless we find something like his Social Security number belonging to a soldier who died in Afghanistan or Iraq. That\u0027s not the case here. The provenance of his Social Security number appears sound, but can you imagine a man who\u0027s doing some sort of business with SimGen who has never taken out a loan of any kind? Who has one credit card on which he charges only one thing: the lease of three trucks?\"\n \"Unlikely...but that doesn\u0027t mean he doesn\u0027t exist.\"\n \"I can tell you that he doesn\u0027t live at the Boise address he gave the leasing company. And that his MasterCard bill goes to an entirely different address: a mail drop in Hicksville.\"\n \"Long Island?\"\n \"At the risk of sounding like an infomercial: But wait - there\u0027s more. The investigator I sent to Idaho turned up something else: Harold Golden began leasing these trucks four years ago. The man who runs the company remembers him because Golden wanted the exact same trucks that had been returned that very day from another lessee. Guess who that lessee was?\"\n Romy shrugged. \"Mercer Sinclair?\"\n \"Close. Manassas Ventures.\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t mean a thing to me.\"\n \"Manassas Ventures was the source of the start-up capital that allowed the brothers Sinclair to get SimGen rolling. Consequently it controls a huge block of SimGen stock.\"\n \"And the connection to Harold Golden?\"\n \"At this point, nothing beyond the trucks. But guess where Manassas Ventures has its office.\"\n \"Hicksville?\"\n \"Exactly. And it has a strange way of doing business. The company rents space in a small out-of-the- way office building but doesn\u0027t seem to have any employees. Manassas Ventures is on the door, but it\u0027s a door that remains locked all day, every day, week after week. Makes you wonder, doesn\u0027t it.\"\n \"A man who doesn\u0027t exist and a business that doesn\u0027t do any business.\"\n Romy felt a tingle along the nape of her neck. \"Am I detecting a pattern here?\"\n \"I think so. Ironically, we\u0027ve been aware of Manassas Ventures all along but never paid any attention to it. I\u0027d assumed it was simply another of the countless venture capital groups that have popped up since the early nineties - one that happened to get lucky and strike it very rich. But I should have known never to assume anything where SimGen is concerned.\"\n \"If Manassas owns a lot of company stock, then it\u0027s logical for it to be involved in SimGen doings.\"\n \"But logic seems to be taking a breather here. For instance, if you were an investment group with SimGen on your list and flush with capital, what would you be doing?\"\n \"I\u0027d be crowing. I\u0027d have impressive offices to attract new ventures to underwrite.\"\n \"Exactly. Yet Manassas Ventures\u0027s only address is a deserted space in a nowhere building.\"\n \"Almost as if they\u0027re hiding.\"\n \"They are. Behind Harold Golden. I believe Manassas invented him as a layer of insulation between itself and the truck rentals. And it almost worked. We were just lucky that our investigator asked the right questions on a day when someone at the leasing company was in a talkative mood. Otherwise, we\u0027d never know the Manassas connection.\"\n \"But why insulate itself?\"\n The tingle in Romy\u0027s neck moved across her shoulders and down her spine. She sensed the situation moving beyond simply wrong...something sinister at work here.\n Zero said, \"Because I\u0027m betting that Manassas Ventures has ongoing involvement with SimGen\u0027s day- to-day workings that it doesn\u0027t want anyone to know about. And the most likely reason for keeping an activity secret is that it\u0027s illegal.\"\n \"But SimGen is one of the richest corporations in the world, with a lock on a unique product\" - she hated when sims were referred to as \"product,\" but this time it fit - \"in high demand. They\u0027re practicallyminting money. They\u0027ve got it all. Why risk a connection to something illegal? It doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\n \"It does if whoever is behind Manassas Ventures is pulling strings inside SimGen. Pulling strings that lead to the basic research facility, perhaps?\"\n That struck a nerve...might explain the company\u0027s adamant refusal to let OPRR near the building, even with a court order.\n Zero went on and Romy could sense him fairly vibrating with anticipation. \"If something illegal or even quasi-legal is going on, we may have found the lever to crack open SimGen\u0027s wall of secrecy. All because you showed up earlier than expected.\"\n \"And caught a worm.\"\n \"Maybe a snake. I\u0027d say Manassas Ventures is long overdue for an in-depth probe of its workings and personnel, wouldn\u0027t you.\"\n \"Anything I can do?\"\n \"In regard to Manassas, no. But as for our friend, Patrick Sullivan - \"\n \"Oh? So he\u0027s \u0027our friend\u0027 now, is he?\"\n Romy sensed a smile behind Zero\u0027s ski mask. \"Not a close friend, not a bosom buddy, but...\" His voice trailed off.\n \"But what?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know...there\u0027s something about him. Maybe I\u0027m feeling a little sorry for him because he\u0027s going through the worst time of his life.\"\n \"Really?\"\n \"His girlfriend dumped him, his house is a charred ruin, he\u0027s been living in a motel room for weeks, and SimGen is putting the screws to his career.\"\n Romy felt her interest growing. \"How so?\"\n \"They\u0027re pressuring Sullivan\u0027s clients to drop him.\"\n She shook her head in amazement. \"How do youknow all this?\"\n \"I have my sources.\"\n \"You\u0027re a SimGen insider. You\u0027ve got to be.\"\n \"Back to Mr. Sullivan?\"\n Romy tore her mind away from the tantalizing possibilities of Zero\u0027s identity. Sullivan...his predicament did sound pretty awful, but the shyster deserved it.\n \"Don\u0027t expect me to shed tears for any lawyer, especially one of the headline hunting variety who\u0027s been taking those sims for a ride.\"\n \"You\u0027re assessment of him might be accurate, but I\u0027ve got to hand it to him: He\u0027s lost a number of big clients and he\u0027s still hanging tough.\"\n \"No kidding?\" Romy was surprised. \"I\u0027d have thought he\u0027d have folded like an old suitcase by now.\"\n \"Well, I don\u0027t expect him to hold up forever, so I believe it\u0027s time we stepped in. And speaking of suitcases...\" Zero lifted a large metal attache case onto the table. \"I\u0027m hoping the contents of this will bolster his fortitude.\"\n He slid it toward Romy who released the catches and lifted the top. She repressed a gasp at sight of the stacks of currency.\n \"How much is in here?\"\n \"Two hundred and fifty thousand.\"\n \"What\u0027s wrong with a check?\"\n \"I feel a man like Mr. Sullivan - I am not blind to his failings - will require more concrete proof of the seriousness of our interest.\"\n Here was concrete, all right - a whole sidewalk. \"How do I approach him?\"\n \"Directly, I would think. I\u0027ll leave the details up to you.\"\n Zero rose. A sign the meeting was over.\n \"But where do I say the money\u0027s from?\"\n \"Again, I leave that to your inventive mind. But since I know how lying bothers you, I\u0027m going to make things easier. I\u0027m giving the money to you, no strings attached.\"\n \"You\u0027rewhat ?\"\n \"That\u0027s right. To do with as you wish. Buy a house or a fleet of sports cars if you want. It\u0027s all yours.\"\n As the shock wore off, she began to understand. \"I see what you\u0027re up to.\"\n Zero said, \"But should you decide to approach Mr. Sullivan with it, I suggest being nice to him. You might find yourself spending a good deal of time with Mr. Patrick Sullivan.\"\n \"I can hardly wait.\" She snapped the lid shut on the money. \"That\u0027s it? You\u0027re letting me walk out of here with a quarter of a million in cash?\"\n \"Yourquarter of a million. Remember?\"\n Romy smiled. This was turning out to be not such a bad day after all. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-19.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: \n Sims (Sims complete) \n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees.
