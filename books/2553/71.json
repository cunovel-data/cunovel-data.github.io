We\u0027ve only got a few more to go.\"\n It seemed like they\u0027d been at this all day. Romy had arrived at his office late this afternoon and together they\u0027d cooked up a list of acronyms, using every possible combination of letters that might conceivably be pronounced \"surge\" - from CERGE, CERJE, CIRJ, and so on, to SIURJ, ZIRJE, ZOORGE and beyond. Then he\u0027d begun plugging them into one Internet search engine after another.\n So far the hits had been few and none had panned out.\n \"Only a few more, you say?\" He stretched. \"I\u0027ll keep at it then. What\u0027s next?\"\n Romy consulted her list. \"S-I-R-G.\"\n Patrick typed it into the entry box on the searcher and hitENTER . Half a second later a string of varicolored type cascaded down the screen. The engine reported 1,753 hits.\n \"We\u0027ve got something,\" he said.\n SIRG turned out to be the acronym for a raft of organizations, ranging from the Summit Implementation Review Group to the Spatial Information Research Group to the Student Internet Research Group.\n \"These sound exciting,\" Romy said dryly, reading over his shoulder. She\u0027d been nibbling on a sweet roll and her breath carried a hint of cinnamon. He was sure her lips would taste even better. \"Hope you didn\u0027t get your hopes up.\"\n Patrick shook his head, trying to forget how close she was and focus on the screen. \"I\u0027ve learned better by now.\"\n He clicked his way through one link after another; all the groups seemed pretty straightforward. Then he came to something called the Social Impact Research Group.\n \"Social impact of what?\" he said.\n \"And on what?\" Romy added.\n The article was an old one, quoting from another even older article. SIRG received only passing mention in reference to some unspecified appropriations bill.\n \"Wait,\" Romy said. \"Appropriations means government. Hit a few more links.\"\n He did but found only scattered mentions of the group; nothing of substance, no hint as to its purpose.\n \"Let me try,\" Romy said.\n They switched seats. Patrick watched her access a directory of US Federal Government agencies and enter a string of asterisks into a password box.\n \"Don\u0027t forget,\" she said, as if reading his mind, \"I work for a government agency myself. I\u0027ve picked up a few passwords and access codes along the way.\"\n He watched a while longer, then got up and moved away. Romy was far more facile than he at the keyboard. She worked too fast for him - he\u0027d no sooner focus on a screen than she\u0027d be clicking to another. He stepped to the window and stared out at the night.\n This block of Henry Street was reasonably well lit. He studied the parked cars for signs of life. None. The only pedestrian was a drab-looking woman making her way along the sidewalk directly below.\n This constant vigilance rawed his nerves. When would it end? When could he relax again, if ever?\n He wandered over to where Tome was busily filing papers.\n \"Getting tired, Tome?\"\n \"No, Mist Sulliman,\" the old sim said, grinning up at him in the narrow confines of the file room. \"This fun.\"\n Whatever turns you on, he thought. He patted the sim\u0027s bony back.\n \"Great, my friend. Have a ball.\"\n Patrick was turning to go when he spotted something blinking on a little table in the corner. Tome followed his gaze. He snatched up the rectangular object and hid it behind his back.\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\n Tome looked down. \"Picture, Mist Sulliman.\"\n \"A picture? Can I see it?\"\n \"Mist Sulliman be mad,\" he said, eyes still on his shoes.\n \"Nonsense. Just let me see.\"\n With obvious reluctance, Tome placed the framed picture, upside down, into Patrick\u0027s outstretched hand.\n He turned it over and stared in shock. The Virgin Mary...Our Lady of Guadalupe, to be exact, but not like Patrick had ever seen her. The traditional gold-leaf glory radiating around her had been enhanced with flashing red rays. Patrick flipped it over and spotted the battery case that powered the diodes.\n \"This is...amazing,\" Patrick said. \"Where did you get it?\"\n \"Buy on street. Mist Sulliman not mad?\"\n \"Why on earth would I be mad?\"\n \"Lady on street yell Tome. Say Mother Mary not for sim.\"\n Bitch. Although he could see how true believers would object to sims taking up their religion, worshippingtheir god. It diminished them, made them feel less special.\n \"But why, Tome? Why\u0027d you buy it?\"\n \"Tome pray for Mist Sulliman and Miss Romy. Ask Lady to protect.\"\n Patrick was touched, didn\u0027t know quite what to say. He stepped past Tome and replaced the blinking icon on the table.\n \"Thank you, Tome. I...we have something called freedom of religion in this country. That means you can pray to any god you want. And...thanks.\"\n He wandered back toward Romy, ready to tell her about Tome\u0027s prayers, when she called out to him.\n \"Look at this,\" she said, her expression troubled. \"This particular SIRG - the Social Impact Research Group - had millions and millions of government dollars poured into it through most of the nineties and into the oughts, and then the money stopped.\"\n \"Money from where?\"\n \"That\u0027s the weird part. I can\u0027t find out who picked up the tab.\"\n \"Somebody had to. Some department or agency had to be debited before SIRG could be credited.\"\n \"I know. There\u0027s a whole string of agencies and departments and groups that seem to be intermediaries but I keep running into dead ends or getting lost in the maze whenever I try to track the money back to its source.\"\n Patrick shook his head. \"Almost like...\"\n Romy looked up at him. \"Manassas Ventures.\"\n \"Do you think...?\"\n She held up a hand. \"Before you go getting excited, let me tell you that I think SIRG might be dead. As in defunct. Can\u0027t find a mention or a penny of appropriations from any source whatsoever for years.\"\n \"Damn! For a moment I thought we were on to something. But then again, how much pay dirt could we expect from something with a name like the Social Impact Research Group?\"\n \"Don\u0027t let a title put you off,\" she said. \"Ever hear of SOG?\"\n \"Son of Godzilla?\"\n Romy smiled up at him. \"Close. Try the \u0027Studies and Observations Group.\u0027 It was started in the Nam era. That innocent title covered a joint Special Operations unit that included members from the Air Force, Navy SEALs, and Special Forces. They were sent into Laos to wage a secret war.\"\n \"So you think someone who thought SOG was a clever cover might have come up with SIRG?\"\n \"Just a thought.\" Romy looked back at the screen and rubbed her neck.\n \"Stiff?\"\n \"Yeah. Been a long day.\"\n He gripped both her shoulders and began kneading the back of her neck with his thumbs. He could feel the warmth of her skin through the light weave of her sweater.\n She groaned. \"That feelsgood .\"\n You\u0027re telling me, he thought.\n \"SIRG appears to be defunct,\" she said as he continued to knead. \"But it could be operating under a different name. Either way, just to be sure we\u0027ve turned over every rock before we move on, I think we should know where its money came from, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"But how?\"\n Patrick stretched his fingers forward, working his massage down to her collar bones.\n \"My...office.\" Romy groaned again. \"You\u0027re making it hard to concentrate.\"\n \"Just soothing those tight muscles. Relax.\" Patrick himself was anything but as a rapturous pressure built within.\n She cleared her throat. \"What was I saying?\"\n \"Something about your office.\" He slipped his fingers over her collar bones onto the upper edges of her pectorals.\n \"Oh, right. OPRR\u0027s computers are linked to the government. And my boss, Milton Ware, is an absolute master at weaving through bureaucratese. I need to find a way to put Uncle Miltie onto the scent without knowing why. Maybe if I - \"\n \"Excuse me?\"\n They both jumped and turned at the sound of a woman\u0027s voice. Relief flooded Patrick as he recognized the figure standing in the doorway.\n \"Miss Fredericks! How did you get in here?\" He could have sworn he\u0027d locked the door.\n Alice Fredericks smiled. \"I\u0027m sorry if I startled you, Mr. Sullivan. But I was walking by and just happened to look up and see the lights, so I thought I\u0027d stop in and inquire as to why you haven\u0027t called me.\"\n Walking by? Patrick thought. Probably watching the place with a telescope.\n He leaned closer to Romy and whispered, \"She\u0027s the one I told you about.\" Romy gave him a puzzled look, but before he could elaborate - \"Oh, no!\" Alice cried, pointing to Tome who had stepped out of the filing room. \"It\u0027s one of them! One of my long lost great-grandchildren! Please take him away! The sight of him tears at my heart!\"\n \"Now I remember,\" Romy whispered. \"Dramatic, isn\u0027t she.\"\n \"Just a bit.\"\n He motioned the baffled Tome back into the file room where he\u0027d be out of sight, then turned to Alice. Though he was still rattled by the way she\u0027d strolled in here off the street, he didn\u0027t want to take it out on her. But it was time to put a stop to these intrusions.\n \"Miss Fredericks, I\u0027m sorry, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be able to spare the time to take your case. And even if I did, in the long run it will come down to your word against SimGen\u0027s, and I don\u0027t think - \"\n \"Even if I have proof?\"\n \"What sort of proof can you have?\"\n \"A check made out to me from Mercer Sinclair.\"\n Yeah, right, he thought. \"How would you happen to have that? Once you cash a check it goes back to the one who issued it.\"\n \"But I didn\u0027t cash it,\" Alice said, eyes wide. \"It was the last payment for letting them use my body to incubate the alien child. I didn\u0027t know they\u0027d steal him from me. How could I take money from the man who stole my child?\" Her eye filled with tears. \"That would be like...like selling my baby!\"\n \"So why didn\u0027t you burn it or tear it up?\"\n \"I kept it as a reminder to stay the course, and because I knew someday I\u0027d have a chance to confront Mercer Sinclair again, and when I did I wanted to be able to throw it back in his face!\"\n \"We\u0027d love to see that check,\" Romy said. When Patrick gave her an are you-nuts? look she nudged him with her elbow and whispered, \"No stone unturned, right?\" Then she raised her voice: \"Can you bring it here?\"\n \"Oh no,\" Alice said. \"I never take it out of my room. But if you want to come visit me, I\u0027ll be very happy to show it to you.\"\n Patrick regarded Alice Fredericks. Was she completely bonkers and dreaming all this up? Just a lonely lady who\u0027d say anything to have company? Or could there be a kernel of truth at the heart of her crazy story?\n Patrick sighed. \"Leave me your address and I\u0027ll see if I can get over tomorrow.\"\n \"Hewill get over tomorrow,\" Romy said, giving him a wry smile. \"Even if I have to drag him.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-71.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: \n Sims (Sims complete) \n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees.
