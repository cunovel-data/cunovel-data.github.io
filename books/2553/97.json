As the Jeep screeched to an unexpected halt, the two following vehicles skidded past and swerved to stops ahead. \"Where\u0027s the blower?\" Luca shouted. \"Give me the fucking blower!\" \"Here,\" Lowery said, slapping the PCA into his palm. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"I am so stupid,\" Luca said, punching in 4-1-1. \"So fucking stupid!\" \"Are you going to tell me - ?\" \"Cannon\u0027s answering service! They\u0027ll know where she is!\" He got the number from information, punched it in, and asked for Dr. Cannon. \"Dr. Cannon\u0027s not available,\" a woman\u0027s voice told him. \"Dr. Moss is covering.\" Shit! \"I really need to speak to Elizabeth personally. This is her brother and we\u0027ve got a family emergency that needs her immediate attention.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m so sorry to hear that. I\u0027ll try her house and - \" \"I\u0027ve already called and she doesn\u0027t answer.\" \"Maybe she\u0027s at the hospital. I can page her if you wish.\" \"Would you? That would be wonderful.\" Luca waited on hold, feeling the time drag by, and then the operator was back on. \"I just spoke to the hospital. Dr. Cannon is in surgery. I can leave a message for her as soon as she gets out.\" Surgery? Could it be...? \"Which hospital?\" \"Nassau Community. Do you want me to - ?\" He cut her off and turned to Lowery. \"Nassau Community Hospital. You know where it is?\" \"Not a clue. Give me the address and the GPU will - \" \"Right.\" Luca punched 4-1-1 again. He\u0027d call the switchboard and ask for the address. \"Why didn\u0027t I see it?\" he shouted. \"The sim\u0027s in labor! That\u0027s why Cannon\u0027s house was empty. Everyone\u0027s at the hospital. She\u0027s having her baby.\" Lowery grinned. \"And we didn\u0027t bring any cigars.\" \"Yes, we did,\" Luca said, patting his HK. \"The exploding kind.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-97.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
