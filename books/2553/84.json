He glanced at Romy, huddled against the passenger door at the far end of the front seat, staring dead ahead without blinking, looking as if she were in a trance. I\u0027ve really done it now, Zero thought. I\u0027ve lost her. She\u0027ll never trust me again. Meerm whimpered at his side. She was curled next to him on the rear seat. He laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder. Tome and Kek hunched behind them in the open rear section. \"Goethals,\" Patrick said. \"Got it. But I think...I think we...\" He seemed to run out of words. \"You think you deserve an explanation,\" Zero said. \"Of course you do.\" \"I mean,\" Patrick said, \"I feel as if the world just tipped ninety degrees.\" Zero glanced again at Romy who still hadn\u0027t moved. She\u0027d known him so much longer than Patrick. Her world must feel even further out of kilter. \"You\u0027re not human?\" Patrick said. \"No.\" \"I heard you tell Meerm that you\u0027re a sim.\" \"I am.\" \"But how come you don\u0027t...?\" \"...look like the average sim? I\u0027m one of the earliest, so early that you\u0027ll find no UPC tattoo on the nape of my neck. Plus I\u0027m a mutant - bigger and paler than my brother sims - too big and too human- looking for the workforce. So they kept me separate. I was raised in SimGen\u0027s basic research facility and after a while I became a mascot of sorts. My only contacts growing up were the Sinclair brothers and their most trusted techs. Later, when Harry Carstairs arrived to take over sim training, he took a special interest in me.\" Harry...how he\u0027d loved Harry Carstairs. The man\u0027s daily visits had been the high point of his adolescence. \"He was impressed by my linguistic skills so he tested my intelligence; when he found it to be not only far above sim average but above human average as well, he and - \" He cut himself off. Better not mention Ellis. \"He got permission to see how far they could take me. I learned to read, and built up my own library; I was never allowed out of basic research, but television gave me a window onto the rest of the world. Harry and I...I guess you might say we bonded. He taught me to play chess and we spent hours hovering over the board.\" He missed Harry, especially their chess games. Every so often Zero would give in to a compulsion to see the man. He\u0027d sneak by Harry\u0027s house at night and watch him as he sat and played chess against his computer; he\u0027d longed to knock on the window and challenge him to a game. But Harry believed him dead, and had to go on believing that. Patrick said, \"But how did you graduate from SimGen mascot to Zero, SimGen nemesis?\" \"I\u0027ve always been called Zero. I imagine it\u0027s derived from part of my serial number when I was an embryo. As for my \u0027graduation\u0027...I believe I became inconvenient. Here I was, this man-size sim who was an evolutionary and commercial dead end. Somewhere along the line, a corporate decision was made to terminate me.\" \"Jesus,\" Patrick whispered. \"Just like that?\" \"Just like that.\" \"What were they going to do - shoot you?\" \"An injection. They drew blood from me at regular intervals. This time they were going to put something in instead of take something out.\" Zero saw Romy glance quickly over her shoulder, then return to her thousand mile stare. \"Scumbags,\" Patrick muttered, shaking his head. Only one, Zero thought. Mercer Sinclair had made the unilateral decision. He looked down at Meerm who\u0027d closed her eyes and seemed to be dozing. Termination would have been her fate if Portero had found her first. Patrick asked, \"How\u0027d you manage to escape?\" \"I found I had a highly placed ally in the company who arranged to fake my death.\" Ellis again. He\u0027d told his brother that he didn\u0027t want a stranger terminating Zero, that he\u0027d do it himself. But he injected Zero with a sedative instead of poison, cremated another dead sim in his place, and spirited him out of SimGen. He told Zero everything, and set him up with a steady flow of cash and data aimed toward one purpose: to stop SimGen and free his brother sims. \"This ally is the source of all your inside information, I take it,\" Patrick said. \"Yes.\" Patrick shook his head again. \"A high-up inside SimGen working against it. Is he nuts or does he have a personal beef with the Sinclairs?\" \"Both, I think. But it\u0027s also a moral issue with him.\" All true. But Zero had always sensed something else driving Ellis Sinclair, almost as if he felt he had to atone for something. Something \"unspeakable,\" perhaps? Patrick laughed. \"Put a sim in charge of bringing down the makers of sims. I\u0027ve got to say, it has a nice symmetry to it. And now that we\u0027ve got Meerm, it looks like your job is just about over. Congratulations, Zero. They chose the right man. I mean sim. I mean - hell, I don\u0027t know what I mean. All I can say is I never had an inkling you weren\u0027t human.\" And now we come to the crucial junction, Zero thought. \"Does it bother you that I\u0027m not?\" He directed the question at Patrick but he was watching Romy. He thought he saw her flinch. \"I don\u0027t know. You\u0027re not like Tome or any other sim I\u0027ve met. In fact, you\u0027re more human than some humans I know. Smarter too. What a world! But you haven\u0027t steered me wrong yet. So I guess the answer is no. To tell the truth, every day I\u0027m getting less and less sure about what exactly \u0027human\u0027 means.\" Bless you, Patrick, he thought, then looked at Romy. He couldn\u0027t bear her silence any longer. This had to be dragged out in the open now. \"And you, Romy?\" he said. \"You haven\u0027t said a word.\" For a few seconds, she didn\u0027t move, then she twisted swiftly in her seat and faced him. Angry tears streaked her cheeks. \"You lied to me!\" \"I never told you I was human.\" \"You pretended to be!\" \"I never pretended to be anything other than who I am. I didn\u0027t even change my name.\" \"You hid yourself - that was a lie!\" \"No, I had to. Would you have joined me if you\u0027d known I was a sim? A mutant sim?\" Her angry expression faltered, then she turned away again. \"Think, Romy. When was I ever untrue to you? Were the goals of our activities against SimGen ever other than what I said they were? Have I ever misled you into doing something that you didn\u0027t want to do, or worked you toward an end that wasn\u0027t your own as well?\" She replied in a tiny voice. \"No.\" \"Then can I ask you why you\u0027re so angry at me?\" \"Who says I\u0027m angry at you?\" she said in that same small voice. \"Maybe I\u0027m angry at me.\" Baffled, he replied, \"I don\u0027t - \" She held up a hand. \"Can we just leave it be? I\u0027ve got some adjusting to do and I need some time. Okay?\" \"I understand, but I need to know: Are you still with us?\" She nodded without speaking, without looking around. Zero leaned back and closed his eyes to hold back the tears. After a while Patrick said, \"Goethals Bridge dead ahead. Why do we want that?\" \"Because it\u0027s the quickest route out of Jersey.\" \"But where are we going?\" \"Dr. Cannon\u0027s.\" He took one of Meerm\u0027s hands in his. \"We\u0027re bringing her the most important patient of her career.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-84.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true.
