No turkey for our sim Christmas, I\u0027m afraid. Just two large pies - a plain and a sausage.\" He glanced at his two guests. \"Do either of you know what Christmas means, by the way?\"\\n\\n Kek didn\u0027t even look up; he\u0027d been lured away from one of the computers where he\u0027d been engrossed inMortal Kombat XX , and now he grabbed a slice of the sausage pie and started wolfing it down.\\n\\n But Tome smiled and said, \"Lights and trees and presents.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s a big part of it. A time of peace on earth and good will toward men, I\u0027m told. But what about sims? Does that include good will toward sims?\"\\n\\n Zero had made the mistake of allowing himself a glass of holiday cheer: one Scotch and water. Terrible tasting stuff, didn\u0027t know how Ellis Sinclair had drunk so much of it all those years, but he\u0027d forced it down - the season to be jolly and all that. Now he wished he hadn\u0027t. Not used to alcohol, and though he wasn\u0027t feeling much in the way of physical effects, it seemed to have untethered his thoughts, leaving them to wander. Now they were wandering into terra incognita.\\n\\n \"Tome not know, Mist Zero.\"\\n\\n Not know what? Oh, yes...about good will toward sims.\\n\\n \"Of course you don\u0027t, Tome. Christmas has become a secular holiday for the most part, but it\u0027s still a religious occasion for those who celebrate the arrival of their god to save mankind. But what of us sims? Are we included in that salvation? Or are we damned?\" He toasted with a piece of plain pie. \"Joy to the world.\"\\n\\n But he felt no trace of joy, felt instead as if he were standing on the brink of a precipice, gazing into the unknown. The world as he\u0027d always known it was about to change. Radically. And with it his relationship to that world and all the people he knew in it. Nothing would ever be the same.\\n\\n He tried to imagine what it would be like to come out of hiding, to wander about with his face exposed to the world, to be aperson . He could not.\\n\\n He surprised himself by starting to sing: \"We three sims of chimpanzee blood, wondering how we\u0027ll ride out the flood...\" He noticed Tome and Kek staring at him. \"Come on, sing! You know the words!\"\\n\\n But then he couldn\u0027t go on, not with his throat constricting around a sob.\\n\\n What have I done? My race, my brother sims - what will happen to them when Meerm\u0027s baby is shoved in the face of the world? By saving them will I doom them to extinction? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-92.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) \\n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \\n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \\n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \\n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
