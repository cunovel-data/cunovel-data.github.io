With the six team members divided between two Jeeps and a rented van, they\u0027d arrived in town with time to spare. They\u0027d left the Jeeps in the lot of an autobody shop and headed for Cannon\u0027s house in the van. The plan was to ditch the van at the shop lot after the op and make it back to SimGen in the Jeeps. But now...\\n\\n Shit, the house was empty.\\n\\n Luca had had his first premonition the moment they\u0027d pulled up in front: the lights were on. Upstairs and down. At four in the morning?\\n\\n They\u0027d crept up to the windows - no one moving about inside. They\u0027d slammed through the rear door - no alarm.\\n\\n Footsteps pounded down the stairs behind him. Luca turned and saw a helmeted figure approaching, recognized him as Lowery when he lifted his visor.\\n\\n \"Three bedrooms upstairs. The reports on her say she lives alone, but all three have slept-in beds. They\u0027re not warm, but I\u0027d guess they haven\u0027t been cold too long. Looks like they left in a big hurry.\"\\n\\n Luca felt as if he were turning to ice. \"You\u0027re saying they might have been tipped?\"\\n\\n Lowery shrugged. \"Who\u0027d tip them? You and me were the only ones who knew where we were going. Maybe they got spooked. Maybe they spotted us watching the place and decided to take off.\"\\n\\n Luca turned away and ground his teeth. He should have kept someone here until the raid, but without Snyder and Grimes he was short-handed. What did he do now?\\n\\n \"All right,\" he said into his helmet mike. \"Everybody back to the van. We\u0027re outta here.\"\\n\\n They\u0027d return to the other cars, but not to SimGen. Not yet. He was staying in this area. Maybe he\u0027d split up the team and send them looking for Cannon\u0027s Volvo. Slim chance there, but better than doing nothing.\\n\\n Needed time to think. No question now that Cannon and the sim were together. Find the doc and he\u0027d have the sim, and Cadman and Sullivan too, no doubt.\\n\\n Butwhere? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-95.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) \\n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \\n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \\n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \\n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
