{"id":111849,"no":98,"title":"Page 98","content":"Romy, capped, masked, and garbed in surgical green, stood between Betsy and Joanna at the stainless steel sink and learned how to scrub. Betsy\u0027s other scrub nurse had begged off, refusing to leave her five-year-old son to open his Christmas presents without her. That left Romy to fill in.\n \"Work the lather into the skin,\" Betsy was saying, her voice slightly muffled by her surgical mask, \"especially between the fingers and around the nails.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know if I can do this,\" Romy said. She was shaking inside. \"It\u0027s not the blood or the cutting, it\u0027s just that I\u0027ve never even seen - \"\n \"You\u0027ll be fine,\" said Joanna to her right. \"I\u0027ll handle the technical stuff. The most you\u0027ll have to do is hang on to a retractor while - \"\n \"She\u0027s crashing!\" cried an accented voice from the operating room. \"Something\u0027s happened!\"\n \"Oh, God, her uterus!\" Betsy said. \"It\u0027s ruptured!\" She grabbed three packets of sterile gloves and handed them out. \"Just put them on! Forget about gowns and sterile procedure. We\u0027ll worry about sepsis later. Right now we\u0027ve got to move or we\u0027ll lose her!\"\n The next ten minutes were a crimson-tinged blur through which Romy watched Betsy and Joanna work like a single four-armed organism. Their communication seemed almost telepathic as Joanna would slap an instrument into Betsy\u0027s palm as soon as she thrust out her hand. Romy repressed a cry of anguish as Betsy cut quickly through Meerm\u0027s abdominal wall, releasing a torrent of blood that gushed down her flanks and soaked the table. Joanna said something about a uterine artery and Betsy was calling for suction but Romy\u0027s eyes were locked on the glistening bloody dome of Meerm\u0027s uterus floating in that sea of red. And the surreal aspect of being able to glance up at the TV monitor suspended in a corner and view the scene from a different angle. And then Betsy was cutting into that muscular sack, reaching through the slit and pulling out a limp, bloody, silent baby. She held it up by its feet, slapped it once, then again, and with that the little arms jerked outward and the baby emitted a piercing cry. And then Betsy was clamping and cutting the cord as she called for Zero or Patrick, she didn\u0027t care who, to get down here and take charge of this baby because she needed everyone here to help her stop Meerm\u0027s hemorrhaging before she died.\n Seconds later, Patrick, looking even more frightened than he had after they\u0027d been run off the Saw Mill, stumbled through the doors into the OR.\n \"What do Ido ?\" Patrick said as Joanna deposited the squirming, squalling, scrawny, blood-slippery bundle of baby into his arms. It terrified him. God, what if he dropped it? \"I don\u0027t know a thing about babies! I\u0027ve never - \"\n \"No Butterfly McQueens allowed,\" the nurse told him. \"Madhuri will talk you through it.\" Then she turned back to the furious activity on the operating table.\n Patrick turned to the anesthetist. \"Madhuri?\"\n \"Take it to the table over there,\" she replied in a voice that was at once lilting and rapid fire. \"There\u0027s a basin of warm water. Rinse it off, wipe it down, and then wrap it tightly in one of the blankets.\"\n \"But - \"\n \"Hurry! Get it wrapped up! You don\u0027t want hypothermia! I\u0027d help you but I can\u0027t leave - \" She glanced at a monitor and called out, \"Heart rate up to one-sixty!\"\n Gingerly cradling the slippery baby in his arms, Patrick stepped to the cleaning table and placed it on a towel. And now, as it screamed and thrust out its skinny limbs, he could see that it was a girl. He dipped a towel in the basin of warm water and began wiping away the blood and clinging membranes. This caused an escalation in the wails. She was so small, so fragile looking. He hoped he didn\u0027t rub too hard and break something, but he kept it up, working as quickly as he could. As soon as she was reasonably clean, he found a soft blanket at the rear of the table and wrapped it around her.\n He looked over to Madhuri to ask, Now what? but she was busy hanging a new IV bag, a small, red one, on an IV pole so loaded with infusion bags it looked like a Christmas tree. The baby was still crying so he lifted her into his arms - he felt a little more confident now that she was dry and blanket wrapped - and held her tight against him.\n Amazingly, her wails tapered off. And now that he had a chance to look at her, he marveled at how human she looked. He\u0027d never seen a real live newborn. He\u0027d seen photos, of course; whenever the associates at his old firm had entered fatherhood, they always brought in pictures taken right after birth showing these homely, scrunched-up elfin faces that everyone pronounced beautiful. But this babywas beautiful. Maybe because she hadn\u0027t been extruded through a birth canal. A nice symmetrical face, a tiny nose, little bow lips, a light down of hair on her head but none on her body. Damn, she looked human. More so than some of those associates\u0027 kids.\n He turned to look at the operating table and met Romy\u0027s dark eyes, the only part of her face visible between the cap and the mask.\n \"How\u0027s Meerm doing?\" he asked.\n Betsy stood next to Romy, and answered without looking up. \"I clamped the big bleeder but she\u0027s not out of the woods yet. She damn near bled out. We\u0027ve got packed red cells and volume expanders running full blast, and that should bring her pressure back.\"\n \"Patrick,\" said Zero\u0027s voice over the loudspeaker, \"hold up the baby so we can get a good view.\"\n Patrick turned, loosened the blanket, and lifted her toward the camera lens pointed his way from the balcony. Zero had got the video system working in time; now he seemed to have mastered it. Patrick glanced at the monitor and saw himself, viewed from above, holding the baby.\n \"Boy or girl?\" Romy asked as Patrick turned back their way.\n \"Girl. A beauty.\"\n Betsy\u0027s head snapped up. \"Abeautiful girl?\"\n \"A real doll.\"\n Patrick saw the confusion in Betsy\u0027s eyes and was framing a question about it when Madhuri began shouting.\n \"V-fib! She\u0027s in V-fib!\"\n Oh, no! Zero felt a pang as he saw the sudden frenzied activity around the operating table on the computer screen. You can\u0027t lose her. She just became a mother.\n He watched with growing dismay as Betsy performed CPR on Meerm\u0027s chest, then applied the defibrillator paddles, shocking her heart again and again. His eyes drifted from the painful scene to the thumbnail feeds he\u0027d accessed from the hospital\u0027s security cameras - an easy task once he\u0027d got the hang of the program. Almost five in the morning and all quiet at Nassau County Community Hos - Zero stiffened as he saw two Jeeps and a van pull up at the emergency room entrance. No audio, but the way the vehicles rocked on their springs meant they\u0027d been moving fast.\n Most likely nothing, he told himself, but he kept watching, and his gut began a quick crawl when he saw six men in full SWAT gear pile out onto the pavement. He couldn\u0027t see their faces through their lowered visors but he spotted \"FBI\" on the back of one of them. He didn\u0027t believe that for an instant. This was SIRG through and through, and maybe Portero himself.\n He glanced at the OR feed - Betsy was still laboring over Meerm\u0027s inert, supine form - then at his upload indicator for the digital movie of the birth. Almost complete. But now he had to slow the invaders, mislead them, divert them.\n As Zero slipped the ski mask back over his head, he had an idea... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-98.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: \n Sims (Sims complete) \n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
