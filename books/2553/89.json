A perfect meeting place. The mall was staying open late for last-minute Christmas shoppers. Luca had taken advantage of that, arriving early and picking up a bracelet for Maria. He\u0027d wait until after the holidays to dump her - no sense in spending New Year\u0027s Eve alone.\\n\\n He wondered why Lister had insisted on a face to face tonight. He guessed it wouldn\u0027t be a happy meeting. When he opened the SUV\u0027s door and saw the expression on his old CO\u0027s fleshy face, he was sure of it.\\n\\n \"Cold out there,\" Luca said as he slipped into the passenger seat and slammed the door.\\n\\n \"Cold everywhere,\" Lister said. He sounded tired.\\n\\n Not a good start. Better cut to the chase.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the word on the plan? How many men they giving us?\"\\n\\n Lister shook his head. \"None.\"\\n\\n Luca felt as if he\u0027d been slapped. \"None? How are we going to - ?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not.\" He unbuttoned his camel hair coat. \"They think using Strickland\u0027s body as bait is a waste of time. Why should anyone care about his body when his DNA fingerprint is on computer.\"\\n\\n \"But it won\u0027t be,\" Luca said. \"Not after we hack the NYPD system.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s not on just the NYPD computer. If you remember, Strickland had a rap sheet that included a couple of sexual assaults - one in Nassau County and one in Rockland - and a rape in Queens that he pleaded down to simple assault. He got around. And so did his RFLP. Seems if you\u0027re caught on a sexual assault in one area, the Special Victims Units in all the surrounding areas check your DNA for a match in the unsolved cases on their books. Craig Strickland\u0027s DNA is in dozens and dozens of police computers all over the tri-state area. Even we can\u0027t hack all those databases. It\u0027s an easy bet that a sharpie lawyer like Sullivan will figure that out, and have a good laugh at us if we try to use Strickland as bait.\"\\n\\n Luca clenched his teeth. Damn. He should have thought of that.\\n\\n \"Dumb idea, Luca,\" Lister said. \"It had people questioning your suitability for leading a field operation. Fortunately I was able to defuse that talk with your other idea. That went over big. The Old Man sent two people from his own office to help me canvass the SimGen Natal Center staff. We\u0027ve been at it all day.\"\\n\\n \"We?\" Luca said, glad he\u0027d presented the Natal Center idea as his own.\\n\\n Lister smiled. \"I know I\u0027ve become something of a REMF, but with manpower so short, I had to get personally involved.\"\\n\\n \"Did anyone mention being approached?\"\\n\\n Lister shook his head. \"Negative.\"\\n\\n \"One of them could be lying. That sim\u0027s baby is too valuable to leave the delivery to chance. They\u0027re going to want experienced help.\"\\n\\n \"I agree. But then I thought to myself, if I was looking for that kind of expertise, would I approach a Natal Center OB and ask him or her to jeopardize career and benefits and pension plan and stock optionsand take a pass on a five-million-dollar bounty? I don\u0027t think so. No, if I were smart - and these people are reasonably smart - I\u0027d go to aformer SimGen Natal Center OB, preferably a disgruntled one. One with a grudge or a score to settle.\"\\n\\n Luca found himself nodding. Good thinking.\\n\\n \"Any hits?\"\\n\\n \"A few of them look promising. Most have relocated but one still lives in the area. Name\u0027s Elizabeth Cannon. Her letter of resignation was a real bridge burner, calling SimGen a \u0027slave factory\u0027 and its board of directors \u0027morally bankrupt.\u0027 She lives on Long Island now and needs checking out. I emailed you the particulars. Finding this sim isn\u0027t just your number-one priority, Luca; it\u0027s theonly priority.\"\\n\\n \"I understand.\"\\n\\n \"Do you? I hope so. This couldn\u0027t be happening at a worse time. We should be devoting all our resources to making sure Guillotine comes off letter perfect; instead, I\u0027m not reporting two dead operatives and praying that damn monkey doesn\u0027t give birth before you find her. This has got all the makings of a major clusterfuck.\"\\n\\n Luca realized with a start that Lister was scared. Beneath the tough-guy pose, he was terrified. Not for his future in SIRG, but the future of SIRG itself. They were all frightened, all the way up to the Old Man.\\n\\n Lister took a deep breath. \"I\u0027ll be hunting down the other disgruntled OBs. Cannon\u0027s yours.\" He paused. \"You look tired, but I don\u0027t advise sleep. Get on this ASAP. We don\u0027t know how much time we have.\"\\n\\n \"Roger.\"\\n\\n The meeting over, Luca stepped out of the SUV and watched Lister drive away.\\n\\n Elizabeth Cannon...he\u0027d check her out first thing in the morning. But he also wanted to check out this genomic competition that had so rattled the Sinclairs. He needed every edge he could get.\\n\\n He headed for his office computer to look up some genetics. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-89.html","bookId":2553,"book":{"id":2553,"title":"SIMS","description":"Storyline: Sims (Sims complete) \\n Just a few hundred genes separate humans from chimpanzees. Imagine someone altering the chimp genome, splicing in human genes to increase the size of the cranium, reduce the amount of body hair, enable speech. What sort of creature would result? \\n Sims takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It\u0027s a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated. A world where dangerous or boring manual labor is gradually being transferred to \"sims,\" genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human. The chief innovator in this world is SimGen, which owns the patent on the sim genome and has begun leasing the creatures worldwide. \\n But SimGen is not quite what it seems. It has secrets . . . secrets beyond patents and proprietary processes . . . secrets it will go to any lengths to protect. Sims explores this brave new world as it is turned upside down and torn apart when lawyer Patrick Sullivan decides to try to unionize the sims. \\n Right now, as you read these words, some company somewhere in the world is toying with the chimp genome. That is not fiction, it is fact. Sims is a science thriller that will come true. One way or another.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sims.jpg","author":"F.
