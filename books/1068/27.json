{"id":39620,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. WEAVING THE WEB.","content":"In his well-deserved character of prudent campaigner, Mr. Simnel took no immediate steps to avail himself of the signal advantage which he had gained in his interview with Mr. Townshend. That eminent British merchant went abroad, and his name was recorded among a choice sprinkling of fashionables as honouring the steamship Baron Osy, bound for Antwerp, with their presence, and, on the \"better-day-better-deed\" principle, selecting the Sunday as the day of their departure. Mr. Simnel read the paragraph with a placid smile; he had seen sufficient of Mr. Townshend in that interview to guess that his illness was merely the result of care and worry, and that there was no reason to apprehend his proximate death. Antwerp--doubtless thence Brussels, the Rhine, and perhaps Switzerland--would make a pleasant tour; and as for any idea of escape, he knew well enough that that thought had never crossed Mr. Townshend\u0027s mind. The old gentleman knew he would have to pay the possessor of his secret heavily in one way or another, but in what he was as yet totally ignorant; besides, his business engagements in London utterly prevented all chance of his retiring in any sudden manner. And so Mr. Simnel remained quietly at his post at the Tin-Tax Office, apparently not taking any notice of any thing save the regular business routine, but in reality intent on his earnest cat-like watching of all around him, and always ready to pull any string at what he considered the proper opportunity. He kept his eyes on Mr. Beresford, and knit his eyebrows very much as he contemplated that gentleman\u0027s proceedings. Whether prompted by anxiety for the fate of his eight-hundred pounds loan or by some other occult reason, Mr. Simnel had been specially watchful over the Commissioner, and urged upon him to bring the speculation in which he had embarked to a prosperous close. With this view he had dissuaded Beresford from going to Scotland, whither, as usual, he was bound on his autumnal excursion; representing to him that he had of late been very lax in his attendance; that he had had much more leave of absence than any of his brother commissioners; that Sir Hickory Maddox had once or twice referred to the subject in any thing but a complimentary manner; and that the best thing he could do to stave off an impending row would be to volunteer to stop in town, and let the other members of the board have a chance of running away in the fine weather. At this suggestion Mr. Beresford looked very black and waxed very wroth, and couldn\u0027t see why the deuce, and on his oath couldn\u0027t tell the necessity, \u0026c.; but relented somewhat when his friend pointed out to him that there was no necessity for his attending more than twice a week at the office, just to sign such papers as were pressing; and that instead of remaining in his South-Audley-Street lodgings, he could go out and take rooms at a beautiful little inn in the village of Whittington, where there was a glorious cook, a capital cellar, beautiful air, splendid prospect, and above all, which was twenty minutes\u0027 canter from the Uplands, Schr?der\u0027s summer place. To this plan Mr. Beresford consented; and after asking for a further loan of fifty, and getting five-and-twenty, from Simnel, Beresford and his mare Gulnare were domesticated at the Holly Bush, and he prepared to make play. But somehow the state of affairs did not please Mr. Simnel. One day, when he and Mr. and Mrs. Schr?der were Beresford\u0027s guests, he seemed specially annoyed; and on the next occasion of his friend\u0027s visiting the office, he took the opportunity of speaking to him. \"I want to say a word to you, Master Charles,\" said he, entering the board-room and addressing Beresford, who was stretched on the sofa reading the Post, and envying the sportsmen whose bags were recorded therein. \"I want to know how you\u0027re getting on.\" \"Getting on! in what way?\" asked Beresford, putting down the paper and lazily looking round; \"as regards money, do you mean? because, if so, I could take that other five-and-twenty from you with a great amount of satisfaction.\" \"You\u0027re very good,\" said Simnel, with a sardonic grin; \"but I\u0027d rather not. I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ve been trying some of Dr. Franklin\u0027s experiments with kites again recently; at all events, I\u0027ve seen several letters addressed to you in Parkinson\u0027s--of Thavies Inn, I mean--handwriting; which looks any thing but healthy. However, I didn\u0027t mean that; I meant in the other business--the great venture.\" \"Oh,\" said Beresford, \"that\u0027s all right.\" \"I\u0027m glad to hear it. Satisfactory, and all that sort of thing, eh?\" \"Perfectly. Why do you ask?\" \"Well, to tell you the truth,\" said Simnel, with that kind of honest bluntness, that inexpressible frankness, generally assumed by a man who is going to say something disagreeable, \"I had an idea that it was quite the opposite. When we dined with you the other day,--deuced good dinner it was too; I was right to recommend you there, wasn\u0027t I? I haven\u0027t tasted such spitchcocked eels for years; and that man\u0027s moselle has a finer faint flavour of the muscat than any I know in England,--when we dined with you, as I say, I fancied things were all wrong with the lady. I talked to the old boy, as in duty bound, and listened to all his platitudes about the influence of money--as though I didn\u0027t know about that, good lord! But the whole time I was listening, and chiming in here and there with such interjections as I thought appropriate, I kept my eye on you and madam; and from what I saw, I judged it wasn\u0027t all plain-sailing. I was right; wasn\u0027t I?\" \"Well,\" said Mr. Beresford, between his teeth, \"you were, and that\u0027s the truth. We\u0027ve come to grief somehow; but how, I can hardly tell. It was going on splendidly; I had followed all your instructions to the letter, and, in fact, I was thoroughly accepted as her brother, when she suddenly veered round; and though I can\u0027t say she\u0027s been unkind, yet she has lost all that warmth that so pleasantly characterised her regard; and now, I think, rather avoids me than otherwise.\" \"You\u0027ve not overdone it, have you? Not been lapsing into your old style of flirtation, and--\" \"No; on my honour, no. I rather think some of her friends have been putting the moral screw on. You recollect a Miss Lexden--Mrs. Churchill that is now?\" \"Perfectly! But she would not be likely to object to a flirtation.\" \"Not as mademoiselle, but as madame she has rangéed herself, and I believe her husband is a straight-laced party. She was up at Uplands for a couple of days, and rather snubbed me when I presented myself there in my fraternal character. I\u0027ve been putting things together in my mind, and I begin to think that Mrs. Schr?der\u0027s coldness dated from Mrs. Churchill\u0027s visit.\" \"Likely enough. I daresay Mrs. Churchill goes in tremendously now for all the domestic virtues. If a reformed rake makes the best husband, a penitent flirt ought to make the best wife; and, by all accounts, Miss Barbara Lexden was a queen of the art. I hear that she and her husband lead a perpetually billing-and-cooing existence, like a pair of genteelly-poor turtles, in some dovecot near Gray\u0027s Inn.\" \"That man Lyster\u0027s been a good deal to the house lately, too. I always hated that fellow, and I know he hates me; he looks at me sometimes as though he could eat me. Schr?der seems to have taken a fancy to him; and I sometimes half fancy that he has a kind of spoony attachment to Mrs. Schr?der--if you recollect, I told you I thought he was after her when we were all down at Bissett--though I don\u0027t think very much of that. I\u0027ll tell you what it is, Simnel,\" continued Mr. Beresford, in a burst of confidence, straggling up into a sitting position on the sofa, and beating his legs with the folded newspaper as he spoke, \"I\u0027m getting devilish sick of all this dodging and duffing, and I\u0027ve been thinking seriously of calling my creditors together, getting them to take so much a-year, and then going in quietly and marrying Kate Mellon after all.\" Mr. Simnel\u0027s face flushed but for an instant; it was its normal colour when he said, \"You\u0027re mad! You, with the ball at your foot, to think of such a course! So much a-year, indeed! Butchers and bakers do that sort of thing, I believe, when they\u0027ve been let in; but not forty-per-cent men; not money-lending insurance-offices. Breathe a hint of your state, and they\u0027d be down upon you at once, and sell you up like old sticks. Besides, you couldn\u0027t come to any arrangement with your creditors without its leaking out somehow. It would get into those infernal trade-circulars, or protection-gazettes, or whatever they\u0027re called; and if the Bishop or Lady Lowndes heard of it, all your chances of inheriting in either of those quarters would be blown to the winds. As to--to Kate Mellon, you may judge how your alliance with her would please either of the august persons I have named.\" \"Jove! you\u0027re right,\" said Beresford, biting his nails. \"Right, of course I am; and here you\u0027ve only to wait, and an heiress--a delightful little creature to boot--is absolutely thrown into your arms. You\u0027re a child, Charley, in some things,--you clever men always have a slate off somewhere, you know,--and in business you\u0027re a positive child. Can\u0027t you see that yours must be a waiting race?--that you mustn\u0027t mind being hustled, and bothered, and cramped, at the beginning, but must always keep your eyes open for your chance, and then make the running? The least impetuosity, such as you hint at, would throw away every hope, and destroy a very excellently planned scheme. Oh, you needn\u0027t wince at the word; we are all schemers in love, as well as in every thing else, if we only acknowledged it.\" \"Then you counsel my keeping on still, and endeavouring to regain my influence?\" \"Certainly; by all means. It will come back, never fear. And look here, Charley; don\u0027t fall into that horribly common and vulgar error of abusing the people who are supposed to be thwarting your plans. Be specially kind, on the contrary, in all you say of them. This Captain Lyster, for instance, I should proclaim, if I were you, a thorough gentleman--a prolix chevalier of a type now seldom seen--a man evidently smothering an unhappy passion for--for--any body but Mrs. Schr?der. Wouldn\u0027t the other one do? Mrs. Churchill, I mean.\" \"Do! What do you mean? There used certainly to be a flirtation between them at one time, and--\" \"Quite enough. Only keep Mrs. Schr?der from the notion that Lyster is spooning her; for that\u0027s enough at once to turn her silly little thoughts to him. Speak kindly of every one; and don\u0027t show the smallest signs of weariness, depression, or discouragement.\" When Mr. Simnel returned to his own room, he settled himself down into his chair, and fell to nursing his leg and thinking, with the old sinister smile on his face. \"He\u0027s not the easiest fellow in the world to deal with--Beresford! At least, he\u0027d be difficult to some; but I think I\u0027ve got him in hand. Wants every thing to run slick off the reel at once, the idiot! As though any great coup had ever been pulled off, save by waiting, and watching, and patience. Marry Kate Mellon, indeed!\" and here Mr. Simnel\u0027s fingers, intertwined across his knee, cracked as he pulled at them--\"marry Kate Mellon, and with such a damned air of patronage too! No, my young friend, never! You held a trump-card there, and you neglected to play it; and in my game there\u0027s no revoking. I must see Kitty, and look how the land lies. I think I\u0027ve stalled Master Charley off for some little time; and it\u0027s no use bringing about an éclaircissement of the Schr?der business; which Kitty would be safe to do as soon as she had any tangible proof. Then I should lose my eight hundred pounds in Charley Beresford\u0027s general and helpless smash. But I\u0027d sooner drop them than miss my chance of Kitty. Slippery, though--slippery as the deuce!\" and Mr. Simnel put his elbow on his knee, and his face into his hand, and sat plucking at his chin \"hankers after Beresford, no doubt,--I think has a liking for that young Prescott; but that I\u0027ll put a stop to to-day,--and I suppose only thanks me for my kindness. And yet I can put the finishing stroke to the whole thing in one moment; only want the one connecting-link and the story\u0027s complete; and then I\u0027ll take my oath she\u0027ll have me. I\u0027ll ride up there this afternoon, and just see how the land lies.\" In accordance with this determination, Mr. Simnel that afternoon mounted his thoroughbred and cantered off to The Den. He found the mistress of the house at home, seated on a rustic seat, in a little grass-plot in front of the drawing-room window, with a carriage-whip in her hand, with which she was flicking the heads off such flowers as were within reach. She had evidently just come in from a drive, for she still wore her bonnet and black-lace shawl, though the former was perched on the top of her head, to keep off the sun, while the latter hung trailing down her back. She had altered in appearance, and not for the better: her eyes were unnaturally bright; her cheeks sunken, and marked here and there with hectic patches. Simnel gave his horse to a groom, and walked up the garden-path. Kate Mellon looked up at the sound of his advancing footsteps; at first vacantly enough, but when she recognised him, she roused herself, and got up to meet him. \"How are you Simnel?\" she said, with outstretched hand. \"I was thinking of you only to-day, and wondering what had become of you. It\u0027s ages since you\u0027ve been up here.\" \"I\u0027ve been very busy, Kate, and been unable to come. You know my wish is to come as frequently as possible; oh, you needn\u0027t shake your head, because you are quite certain of it; but that\u0027s neither here nor there. I keep to my portion of the contract, and shall not bore you about myself until I\u0027ve shown you I\u0027ve a right to ask you to listen to me. And now, how are you, and what are you doing? To tell truth, I don\u0027t think you look very bonny, young woman: a little dragged, eh? End of the season, perhaps?\" \"Oh, I\u0027m all right!\" said Kate, hurriedly; \"never better in health, and jolly; that\u0027s the great point, isn\u0027t it, Simnel, eh? I\u0027m learning to look after number one, you know; and when you can do that, you\u0027re all right, ain\u0027t you? Have some lunch? No? then look here; I\u0027ve got something you must taste,--some wonderful Madeira. Oh, all right; I know it\u0027ll put some colour into your cheeks, and do you good.\" She called to a passing servant, and the wine was brought,--rare old tawny, full-bodied, mellow Madeira,--such wine as is now to be met in about a dozen houses in the land, and utterly different from the mixture of mahogany-shavings and brandy which is sold under its name. Simnel poured out two half-glasses; but Kate took the decanter from him, filled her glass to the brim, and nodding to him, drank off half its contents. \"Ah!\" said she, with a long-drawn inspiration; \"that\u0027s the stuff! No nonsense in that, you know; doesn\u0027t pretend to be what it isn\u0027t, and can\u0027t deceive you. Tom Gillespie sent me a lot of that: found no end of it in the cellars of his old uncle, the East-India Director, whose tin he came in for. I find it does me good, steadies my nerve, and gives me fresh life. What are you shaking your head at?\" \"It\u0027s dangerous tipple, Kate. I don\u0027t like to hear you talk like that. Your nerves used to be as strong as steel, without any steadying. I say, Kitty,\" said Mr. Simnel with a grave face; \"you\u0027re not giving way to this sort of thing for--\" \"For what?\" interrupted Kate, with a discordant laugh; \"for comfort? Oh, no, thank you; I don\u0027t want that yet: I don\u0027t want to drown my sorrows in the bowl. I haven\u0027t got any sorrows, and I shouldn\u0027t do that with them if I had. By the way, Simnel, how is that affair going on,--you know what I mean? You promised to let me know.\" \"I believe it stands very much the same as it did,\" said he. \"Then it hasn\u0027t worn out yet? he isn\u0027t tired of it, eh?\" she asked eagerly. \"No; it still goes on.\" \"You promised to tell me the woman\u0027s name, Simnel; why haven\u0027t you done so? You pretend friendship for me, and then you keep things from me that I ought to know; and you don\u0027t come and see me, and,--There, I don\u0027t believe in you a bit!\" \"I keep things from you until the proper time for you to know them. I don\u0027t come and see you, because all the leisure time I have had has been devoted to your interests; and, by the way, Kate, that brings me to the occasion of my present visit. I suppose you give me credit for sincerity--\" \"Oh, ah; well, what then?\" \"I mean that you believe in me sufficiently to think that any step I should take, any question I should ask, would not be out of mere idle curiosity; but because I thought they would be beneficial to you?\" She nodded her head, and stretched her hand towards the decanter; but seeing Simnel frown, she stopped short, took up the whip which lay close by, and commenced flicking the flowers again. \"I want to ask you about your people,\"--the girl started;--\"who they are; where you came from; what you know of them.\" \"You know all that fast enough,--from Yorkshire,--you\u0027ve heard me say before. What more\u0027s wanted to be known? I pay my way, don\u0027t I, and who does more? I\u0027m not required to show my christening certificate to every one that wants a horse broke, I suppose?\" \"What a fiery child it is!\" said Simnel. \"No one has a right to ask any thing at all about it,--I least of all; but I think,--and I am not sanguine, you know--that I shall be able, if you will confide in me, to help you very greatly in the most earnest wish of your life.\" \"Stop!\" exclaimed Kate; \"do you know what that is?\" \"I think I do,\" said Simnel, looking at her kindling eyes, quivering nostril, and twitching lips. \"If not, I\u0027ll tell you; I don\u0027t mind telling you: revenge on Charles Beresford! revenge! revenge!\" and at each repetition of the word she slashed savagely at the tall flowers near her. \"Well, I think I might say I could help you in that,\" said Simnel quietly; \"but you must be frank. You know I\u0027m a man of the world; and I\u0027ve made it my business to go a little into this question. So now tell me your life, from the first that you can remember of it.\" \"You\u0027re a cool hand, Simnel but I know you mean running straight, so I don\u0027t mind. First thing of all I can recollect is being held out at arm\u0027s length by Phil Fox, as the child in his great trick-act of Rolla, or the something of Peru. The circus belonged to old Fox, Phil\u0027s father; and I used to live with the Foxes,--the old man and woman and Bella Fox, and Phil and his wife. Bad lot she was: had been a splendid rider, but fell and broke her leg; and was always vicious and snappish, and that irritating, I wonder Phil could put up with her. They were very kind to me, the Foxes, and I was quite like their own child; and I played fairies, and flower-girls, and columbines, and such like, all on horseback, in all the towns we went circuit. I used to ask the old man sometimes about myself; but he never would say more than that I was his little apprentice, and I should find it all right some day. And so I went on with them till I grew quite a big girl, and used to do the barebacked-steed business, and what I liked better, the riding-habit and the highly-trained charger dodge, until old Fox declared there was no better rider in England than me. I was just nineteen, when he sent for me one night,--it was at Warwick, I recollect, and we\u0027d had a stunning house,--and I found him with two gentlemen standing with him. He pointed to one of them, and he said to me: \u0027Express\u0027--that\u0027s the name he used to call me,--\u0027Express, this is the gentleman that bound you \u0027prentice to me ever so many years ago. He\u0027s come to take you away now, and make your fortune.\u0027 I cried, and said I didn\u0027t want my fortune made, and that I wouldn\u0027t go; but after a long talk full of business, I saw it would be for my good, and I agreed. So this place was bought for me in my name, and here I\u0027ve been ever since.\" \"And who were those gentlemen?\" \"That\u0027s exactly what I can\u0027t tell you.\" \"Can\u0027t tell?\" \"Won\u0027t, if you like it better. There, don\u0027t look vexed. I\u0027ll tell you this much, one of them was my uncle,--my real uncle, I firmly believe,--though on which side you must find out.\" \"And the other?\" \"The other I love dearer than any one on earth.\" \"Dearer than you loved--\" \"I know who you\u0027re going to say; infinitely dearer! but in--there; there\u0027s enough of that. One thing more I\u0027ll tell you: up to this hour I\u0027ve never been told my father\u0027s name or rank in life.\" \"And this benevolent uncle did it all? Quite like a play, by Jove! Well, I\u0027ve not learned much; but I may be able to make something of it--something that will be good for us both.\" \"That\u0027s all right! and now your business is finished?\" \"Yes, entirely--no, not quite, by the way; I wanted to say one word to you on another subject. You know I\u0027m not likely to be jealous Kitty--\" \"So far as I\u0027m concerned, you\u0027ve no right to be.\" \"I know, of course; but still one doesn\u0027t like these things. There\u0027s a young man named Prescott, who is in my office. I notice that he\u0027s constantly in your company; I\u0027ve met you with him half-a-dozen times, and I hear frequently from others of his being with you.\" \"What of that?\" she asked, with flushing cheek; \"are you to settle my company for me?\" \"Not at all--not at all; but I\u0027m speaking both for your good and his. He\u0027s a young fellow of good abilities; but he\u0027s thoughtless and foolish, and, what\u0027s worse than all, he\u0027s poor. Now this riding about, horse-hiring and that sort of thing, necessarily leads him into expense; and from what I hear, he\u0027s going a great deal too fast. I hear all sorts of things about the young fellows who are under me, and I\u0027m told that your friend Mr. Prescott is getting involved in money-matters; in fact, that he\u0027s mixed up in bill-transactions to an amount which, for him, is heavy, with a blood-sucking rascal named Scadgers, who is one of the pests of society in general, and government offices in particular.\" \"Scadgers!\" replied Kate; \"what a funny name! Scadgers, eh?\" \"A good many people have found it any thing but a funny name, Kitty. Now, though I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any thing between you and Mr. Prescott--\" \"Don\u0027t you trouble any more about that; perhaps you\u0027ve never noticed that Mr. Prescott never is with me except when one of my pupils is there too: now do you understand?\" \"There was no pupil nor any one else with you when I saw him talking to you in the Row some twelve months since; and he scuttled off as I rode up: however, I thought I\u0027d warn you about him. He\u0027s on the downward road, and unless he pulls up, he\u0027ll come to grief; and it wouldn\u0027t do for you to be mixed up in any thing of that sort.\" He sat some time longer talking of ordinary matters, and rattling on in his best style. In every thing he said there was a tinge of attention almost bordering on respect to his companion, which she did not fail to notice, and which decidedly impressed her in his favour. Indeed, Kate Mellon never had imagined that Mr. Simnel could have made such progress in her good graces as he did this day. They never recurred to any serious topic until his horse was brought, when just as he was mounting she touched him on the shoulder, and said, \"You\u0027ll not forget to keep me up to the mark about that business?\" then, with a half-shuddering laugh, \"I\u0027m still interested, you know, in that young man\u0027s progress.\" Simnel wheeled round and looked at her steadily under his bent eyebrows. \"You shall be made acquainted with any thing that happens, depend upon it. Adieu!\" and he sprang to the saddle, raised his hat, and rode slowly off. \"Not half cured yet,\" said he to himself, \"not half; and yet so savage at his slight, that she\u0027d do him any bad turn on the spur of the moment, and repent of it instantly. She was telling truth about Prescott, I know; but it was best to break up that instantly. How lovely she looked! a little flushed, a little excited; but that only added to her charm. I didn\u0027t like that Madeira being so handy, by the way; I must look after that. By Jove, what a fairy it is! where\u0027s there one to compare to her? so round and plump and well put together! And if I can only square this family history--uncle, eh? who the deuce can that have been? That\u0027s an important link in the chain. And somebody she loves, too; what the deuce does that mean? Ah, well, it\u0027s coming to a head now: another month ought to enable me to pull up the curtain on the last act of the drama.\" And Kate returned to her garden-chair as the sound of the horse\u0027s hoofs died away in the distance; and throwing herself back, and drumming with her fingers upon the little table, went off into a reverie. She thought of her devotion to Beresford; how the passion had first grown when he first knew her; how she had given way to it; and how the nourishment of it was one of the brightest phases in her strange odd life. She remembered the first time she saw him, the first compliment he paid her; the way in which his easy jolly behaviour struck her as compared with the dreary vapidity, or, what was worse, the slangy fastness of the other men of her acquaintance. And then she thought of that eventful evening when she had knelt at his feet and--she dashed her clenched fist upon the table as she remembered that, and shuddered and bit her lips when she thought that a description of that scene had been given amid ribald shouts. Mr. Simnel had not so much share of her thoughts as probably he would have wished; but she pondered for a few moments on his eagerness to obtain particulars of her early life, and wondered what scheme he had in hand. She had a very high opinion of his intellect, and felt sure he was using it just then in her service; but she could not conceive to what end his labours were tending. And then she remembered what he had said about Mr. Prescott; and her face grew a little sad. \"Poor Jim!\" she said to herself; \"poor fellow! going to grief, is he? in debt and dropping his money, like a young fool as he is. And that nice girl, too, so fresh and jolly and countrified and innocent! Lord help us! What are you at, Kitty, you idiot why should those things give you a twinge? Steady, now; it\u0027s not often your heart buck-jumps like that. They\u0027ll go all right, those though, if Jim can only be put square. And that he shall be! What\u0027s the use of my hoarding in my old stocking; it\u0027ll never be any good to me; and so I may as well have the pleasure of helping somebody else. Scadgers, that was the name; I\u0027ll get that put right at once. Scadgers! I wonder where he lives. However, that\u0027ll be easily found out. Poor Jim! what a good husband he\u0027ll make that rosy-faced girl!\" What was it that made Kate Mellon\u0027s head drop on her hands, and the tears ooze through the fingers covering her eyes? Not the thought of Mr. Prescott\u0027s marrying some one else surely, for had she not resolutely snubbed his proposals? Certain it is that she remained with her head bowed for full ten minutes, and that when she looked up, her face was tear-dabbled and her eyes red and swollen. She took no heed of her appearance, however, but walked into the house, and pulling out her gaudy blotting-book, she scrawled a long letter, which, when finished, she addressed to \"E.
