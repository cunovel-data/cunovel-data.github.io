{"id":100635,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"I GOT UP very late the next morning, which was not too surprising. Gran had been asleep when I got home, to my relief, and I was able to climb into my bed without waking her.\\n\\n I WAS DRINKING a cup of coffee at the kitchen table and Gran was cleaning out the pantry when the phone rang. Gran eased her bottom up onto the stool by the counter, her normal chatting perch, to answer it.\\n\\n \"Hel-lo,\" she said. For some reason, she always sounded put out, as if a phone call were the last thing on earth she wanted. I knew for a fact that wasn\u0027t the case.\\n\\n \"Hey, Everlee. No, sitting here talking to Sookie, she just got up. No, I haven\u0027t heard any news today. No, no one called me yet. What? What tornado? Last night was clear. Four Tracks Corner? It did? No! No, it did not! Really? Both of\u0027em? Um, um, um. What did Mike Spencer say?\"\\n\\n Mike Spencer was our parish coroner. I began to have a creepy feeling. I finished my coffee and poured myself another cup. I thought I was going to need it.\\n\\n Gran hung up a minute later. \"Sookie, you are not going to believe what has happened!\"\\n\\n I was willing to bet I would believe it.\\n\\n \"What?\" I asked, trying not to look guilty.\\n\\n \"No matter how smooth the weather looked last night, a tornado must have touched down at Four Tracks Corner! It turned over that rent trailer in the clearing there. The couple that was staying in it, they both got killed, trapped under the trailer somehow and crushed to a pulp. Mike says he hasn\u0027t seen anything like it.\"\\n\\n \"Is he sending the bodies for autopsy?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I think he has to, though the cause of death seems clear enough, according to Stella. The trailer is over on its side, their car is halfway on top of it, and trees are pulled up in the yard.\"\\n\\n \"My God,\" I whispered, thinking of the strength necessary to accomplish the staging of that scene.\\n\\n \"Honey, you didn\u0027t tell me if your friend the vampire came in last night?\"\\n\\n I jumped in a guilty way until I realized that in Gran\u0027s mind, she\u0027d changed subjects. She\u0027d been asking me if I\u0027d seen Bill every day, and now, at last, I could tell her yes - but not with a light heart.\\n\\n Predictably, Gran was excited out of her gourd. She fluttered around the kitchen as if Prince Charles were the expected guest.\\n\\n \"Tomorrow night. Now what time\u0027s he coming?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"After dark. That\u0027s as close as I can get.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re on daylight saving time, so that\u0027ll be pretty late.\" Gran considered. \"Good, we\u0027ll have time to eat supper and clear it away beforehand. And we\u0027ll have all day tomorrow to clean the house. I haven\u0027t cleaned that area rug in a year, I bet!\"\\n\\n \"Gran, we\u0027re talking about a guy who sleeps in the ground all day,\" I reminded her. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027d ever look at the rug.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if I\u0027m not doing it for him, then I\u0027m doing it for me, so I can feel proud,\" Gran said unanswerably. \"Besides, young lady, how do you know where he sleeps?\"\\n\\n \"Good question, Gran. I don\u0027t. But he has to keep out of the light and he has to keep safe, so that\u0027s my guess.\"\\n\\n Nothing would prevent my grandmother from going into a house-proud frenzy, I realized very shortly. While I was getting ready for work, she went to the grocery and rented a rug cleaner and set to cleaning.\\n\\n On my way to Merlotte\u0027s, I detoured north a bit and drove by the Four Tracks Corner. It was a crossroads as old as human habitation of the area. Now formalized by road signs and pavement, local lore said it was the intersection of two hunting trails. Sooner or later, there would be ranch-style houses and strip malls lining the roads, I guessed, but for now it was woods and the hunting was still good, according to Jason.\\n\\n Since there was nothing to prevent me, I drove down the rutted path that led to the clearing where the Rattrays\u0027 rented trailer had stood. I stopped my car and stared out the windshield, appalled. The trailer, a very small and old one, lay crushed ten feet behind its original location. The Rattrays\u0027 dented red car was still resting on one end of the accordian-pleated mobile home. Bushes and debris were littered around the clearing, and the woods behind the trailer showed signs of a great force passing through; branches snapped off, the top of one pine hanging down by a thread of bark. There were clothes up in the branches, and even a roast pan.\\n\\n I got out slowly and looked around me. The damage was simply incredible, especially since I knew it hadn\u0027t been caused by a tornado; Bill the vampire had staged this scene to account for the deaths of the Rattrays.\\n\\n An old Jeep bumped its way down the ruts to come to a stop by me.\\n\\n \"Well, Sookie Stackhouse!\" called Mike Spencer, \"What you doing here, girl? Ain\u0027t you got work to go to?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. I knew the Rat - the Rattrays. This is just an awful thing.\" I thought that was sufficiently ambiguous. I could see now that the sheriff was with Mike.\\n\\n \"An awful thing. Yes, well. I did hear,\" Sheriff Bud Dearborn said as climbed down out of the Jeep, \"that you and Mack and Denise didn\u0027t exactly see eye to eye in the parking lot of Merlotte\u0027s, last week.\"\\n\\n I felt a cold chill somewhere around the region of my liver as the two men ranged themselves in front of me.\\n\\n Mike Spencer was the funeral director of one of Bon Temps\u0027 two funeral homes. As Mike was always quick and definite in pointing out, anyone who wanted could be buried by Spencer and Sons Funeral Home; but only white people seemed to want to. Likewise, only people of color chose to be buried at Sweet Rest. Mike himself was a heavy middle-aged man with hair and mustache the color of weak tea, and a fondness for cowboy boots and string ties that he could not wear when he was on duty at Spencer and Sons. He was wearing them now.\\n\\n Sheriff Dearborn, who had the reputation of being a good man, was a little older than Mike, but fit and tough from his thick gray hair to his heavy shoes. The sheriff had a mashed-in face and quick brown eyes. He had been a good friend of my father\u0027s.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir, we had us a disagreement,\" I said frankly in my down-homiest voice.\\n\\n \"You want to tell me about it?\" The sheriff pulled out a Marlboro and lit it with a plain, metal lighter.\\n\\n And I made a mistake. I should have just told him. I was supposed to be crazy, and some thought me simple, too. But for the life of me, I could see no reason to explain myself to Bud Dearborn. No reason, except good sense.\\n\\n \"Why?\" I asked.\\n\\n His small brown eyes were suddenly sharp, and the amiable air vanished.\\n\\n \"Sookie,\" he said, with a world of disappointment in his voice. I didn\u0027t believe in it for a minute.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t do this,\" I said, waving my hand at the destruction.\\n\\n \"No, you didn\u0027t,\" he agreed. \"But just the same, they die the week after they have a fight with someone, I feel I should ask questions.\"\\n\\n I was reconsidering staring him down. It would feel good, but I didn\u0027t think feeling good was worth it. It was becoming apparent to me that a reputation for simplicity could be handy.\\n\\n I may be uneducated and unworldly, but I\u0027m not stupid or unread.\\n\\n \"Well, they were hurting my friend,\" I confessed, hanging my head and eyeing my shoes.\\n\\n \"Would that be this vampire that\u0027s living at the old Compton house?\" Mike Spencer and Bud Dearborn exchanged glances.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\" I was surprised to hear where Bill was living, but they didn\u0027t know that. From years of deliberately not reacting to things I heard that I didn\u0027t want to know, I have good facial control. The old Compton house was right across the fields from us, on the same side of the road. Between our houses lay only the woods and the cemetery. How handy for Bill, I thought, and smiled.\\n\\n \"Sookie Stackhouse, your granny is letting you associate with that vampire?\" Spencer said unwisely.\\n\\n \"You can sure talk to her about that,\" I suggested maliciously, hardly able to wait to hear what Gran would say when someone suggested she wasn\u0027t taking care of me. \"You know, the Rattrays were trying to drain Bill.\"\\n\\n \"So the vampire was being drained by the Rattrays? And you stopped them?\" interrupted the sheriff.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said and tried to look resolute.\\n\\n \"Vampire draining is illegal,\" he mused.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it murder, to kill a vampire that hasn\u0027t attacked you?\" I asked.\\n\\n I may have pushed the naivete a little too hard.\\n\\n \"You know damn good and well it is, though I don\u0027t agree with that law. It is a law, and I will uphold it,\" the sheriff said stiffly.\\n\\n \"So the vampire just let them leave, without threatening vengeance? Saying anything like he wished they were dead?\" Mike Spencer was being stupid.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\" I smiled at both of them and then looked at my watch. I remembered the blood on its face, my blood, beaten out of me by the Rattrays. I had to look through that blood to read the time.\\n\\n \"Excuse me, I have to get to work,\" I said. \"Good-bye, Mr. Spencer, Sheriff.\"\\n\\n \"Good-bye, Sookie,\" Sheriff Dearborn said. He looked like he had more to ask me, but couldn\u0027t think of how to put it. I could tell he wasn\u0027t totally happy with the look of the scene, and I doubted any tornado had shown up on radar anywhere. Nonetheless, there was the trailer, there was the car, there were the trees, and the Rattrays had been dead under them. What could you decide but that the tornado had killed them? I guessed the bodies had been sent for an autopsy, and I wondered how much could be told by such a procedure under the circumstances.\\n\\n The human mind is an amazing thing. Sheriff Dearborn must have known that vampires are very strong. But he just couldn\u0027t imagine how strong one could be: strong enough to turn over a trailor, crush it. It was even hard for me to comprehend, and I knew good and well that no tornado had touched down at Four Corners.\\n\\n The whole bar was humming with the news of the deaths. Maudette\u0027s murder had taken a backseat to Denise and Mack\u0027s demises. I caught Sam eyeing me a couple of times, and I thought about the night before and wondered how much he knew. But I was scared to ask in case he hadn\u0027t seen anything. I knew there were things that had happened the night before that I hadn\u0027t yet explained to my own satisfaction, but I was so grateful to be alive that I put off thinking of them.\\n\\n I\u0027d never smiled so hard while I toted drinks, I\u0027d never made change so briskly, I\u0027d never gotten orders so exactly. Even ol\u0027 bushy-haired Rene didn\u0027t slow me down, though he insisted on dragging me into his long-winded conversations every time I came near the table he was sharing with Hoyt and a couple of other cronies.\\n\\n Rene played the role of crazy Cajun some of the time, though any Cajun accent he might assume was faked. His folks had let their heritage fade. Every woman he\u0027d married had been hard-living and wild. His brief hitch with Arlene had been when she was young and childless, and she\u0027d told me that from time to time she\u0027d done things then that curled her hair to think about now. She\u0027d grown up since then, but Rene hadn\u0027t. Arlene was sure fond of him, to my amazement.\\n\\n Everyone in the bar was excited that night because of the unusual happenings in Bon Temps. A woman had been murdered, and it was a mystery; usually murders in Bon Temps are easily solved. And a couple had died violently by a freak of nature. I attributed what happened next to that excitement. This is a neighborhood bar, with a few out of towners who pass through on a regular basis, and I\u0027ve never had much problem with unwanted attention. But that night one of the men at a table next to Rene and Hoyt\u0027s, a heavy blond man with a broad, red face, slid his hand up the leg of my shorts when I was bringing their beer.\\n\\n That doesn\u0027t fly at Merlotte\u0027s.\\n\\n I thought of bringing the tray down on his head when I felt the hand removed. I felt someone standing right behind me. I turned my head and saw Rene, who had left his chair without my even realizing it. I followed his arm down and saw that his hand was gripping the blond\u0027s and squeezing. The blond\u0027s red face was turning a mottled mixture.\\n\\n \"Hey, man, let go!\" the blond protested. \"I didn\u0027t mean nothing.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t touch anyone who works here. That\u0027s the rule.\" Rene might be short and slim, but anyone there would have put his money on our local boy over the beefier visitor.\\n\\n \"Okay, okay.\"\\n\\n \"Apologize to the lady.\"\\n\\n \"To Crazy Sookie?\" His voice was incredulous. He must have been here before.\\n\\n Rene\u0027s hand must have tightened. I saw tears spring into the blond\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Sookie, okay?\"\\n\\n I nodded as regally as I could. Rene let go of the man\u0027s hand abruptly and jerked his thumb to tell the guy to take a hike. The blond lost no time throwing himself out the door. His companion followed.\\n\\n \"Rene, you should have let me handle that myself,\" I said to him very quietly when it seemed the patrons had resumed their conversations. We\u0027d given the gossip mill enough grist for at least a couple of days. \"But I appreciate you standing up for me.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want no one messing with Arlene\u0027s friend,\" Rene said matter-of-factly. \"Merlotte\u0027s is a nice place, we all want to keep it nice.\u0027Sides, sometimes you remind me of Cindy, you know?\"\\n\\n Cindy was Rene\u0027s sister. She\u0027d moved to Baton Rouge a year or two ago. Cindy was blond and blue-eyed: beyond that I couldn\u0027t think of a similarity. But it didn\u0027t seem polite to say so. \"You see Cindy much?\" I asked. Hoyt and the other man at the table were exchanging Shreveport Captains scores and statistics.\\n\\n \"Every so now and then,\" Rene said, shaking his head as if to say he\u0027d like it to be more often. \"She works in a hospital cafeteria.\"\\n\\n I patted him on the shoulder. \"I gotta go work.\"\\n\\n When I reached the bar to get my next order, Sam raised his eyebrows at me. I widened my eyes to show how amazed I was at Rene\u0027s intervention, and Sam shrugged slightly, as if to say there was no accounting for human behavior.\\n\\n But when I went behind the bar to get some more napkins, I noticed he\u0027d pulled out the baseball bat he kept below the till for emergencies.\\n\\n G RAN KEPT ME busy all the next day. She dusted and vacuumed and mopped, and I scrubbed the bathrooms - did vampires even need to use the bathroom? I wondered, as I chugged the toilet brush around the bowl. Gran had me vacuum the cat hair off the sofa. I emptied all the trash cans. I polished all the tables. I wiped down the washer and the dryer, for goodness\u0027s sake.\\n\\n When Gran urged me to get in the shower and change my clothes, I realized that she regarded Bill the vampire as my date. That made me feel a little odd. One, Gran was so desperate for me to have a social life that even a vampire was eligible for my attention; two, that I had some feelings that backed up that idea; three, that Bill might accurately read all this; four, could vampires even do it like humans?\\n\\n I showered and put on my makeup and wore a dress, since I knew Gran would have a fit if I didn\u0027t. It was a little blue cotton-knit dress with tiny daisies all over it, and it was tighter than Gran liked and shorter than Jason deemed proper in his sister. I\u0027d heard that the first time I\u0027d worn it. I put my little yellow ball earrings in and wore my hair pulled up and back with a yellow banana clip holding it loosely.\\n\\n Gran gave me one odd look, which I was at a loss to interpret. I could have found out easily enough by listening in, but that was a terrible thing to do to the person you lived with, so I was careful not to. She herself was wearing a skirt and blouse that she often wore to the Descendants of the Glorious Dead meetings, not quite good enough for church, but not plain enough for everyday wear.\\n\\n I was sweeping the front porch, which we\u0027d forgotten, when he came. He made a vampire entrance; one minute he wasn\u0027t there, and the next he was, standing at the bottom of the steps and looking up at me.\\n\\n I grinned. \"Didn\u0027t scare me,\" I said.\\n\\n He looked a little embarrassed. \"It\u0027s just a habit,\" he said, \"appearing like that. I don\u0027t make much noise.\"\\n\\n I opened the door. \"Come on in,\" I invited, and he came up the steps, looking around.\\n\\n \"I remember this,\" he said. \"It wasn\u0027t so big, though.\"\\n\\n \"You remember this house? Gran\u0027s gonna love it.\" I preceded him into the living room, calling Gran as I went.\\n\\n She came into the living room very much on her dignity, and I realized for the first time she\u0027d taken great pains with her thick white hair, which was smooth and orderly for a change, wrapped around her head in a complicated coil. She had on lipstick, too.\\n\\n Bill proved as adept at social tactics as my grandmother. They greeted, thanked each other, complimented, and finally Bill ended up sitting on the couch and, after carrying out a tray with three glasses of peach tea, my Gran sat in the easy chair, making it clear I was to perch by Bill. There was no way to get out of this without being even more obvious, so I sat by him, but scooted forward to the edge, as if I might hop up at any moment to get him a refill on his, the ritual glass of iced tea.\\n\\n He politely touched his lips to the edge of the glass and then set it down. Gran and I took big nervous swallows of ours.\\n\\n Gran picked an unfortunate opening topic. She said, \"I guess you heard about the strange tornado.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me,\" Bill said, his cool voice as smooth as silk. I didn\u0027t dare look at him, but sat with my hands folded and my eyes fixed to them.\\n\\n So Gran told him about the freak tornado and the deaths of the Rats. She told him the whole thing seemed pretty awful, but cut-and-dried, and at that I thought Bill relaxed just a millimeter.\\n\\n \"I went by yesterday on my way to work,\" I said, without raising my gaze. \"By the trailer.\"\\n\\n \"Did you find it looked as you expected?\" Bill asked, only curiosity in his voice.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"It wasn\u0027t anything I could have expected. I was really ... amazed.\"\\n\\n \"Sookie, you\u0027ve seen tornado damage before,\" Gran said, surprised.\\n\\n I changed the subject. \"Bill, where\u0027d you get your shirt? It looks nice.\" He was wearing khaki Dockers and a green-and-brown striped golfing shirt, polished loafers, and thin, brown socks.\\n\\n \"Dillard\u0027s,\" he said, and I tried to imagine him at the mall in Monroe, perhaps, other people turning to look at this exotic creature with his glowing skin and beautiful eyes. Where would he get the money to pay with? How did he wash his clothes? Did he go into his coffin naked? Did he have a car or did he just float wherever he wanted to go?\\n\\n Gran was pleased with the normality of Bill\u0027s shopping habits. It gave me another pang of pain, observing how glad she was to see my supposed suitor in her living room, even if (according to popular literature) he was a victim of a virus that made him seem dead.\\n\\n Gran plunged into questioning Bill. He answered her with courtesy and apparent goodwill. Okay, he was a polite dead man.\\n\\n \"And your people were from this area?\" Gran inquired.\\n\\n \"My father\u0027s people were Comptons, my mother\u0027s people Loudermilks,\" Bill said readily. He seemed quite relaxed.\\n\\n \"There are lots of Loudermilks left,\" Gran said happily. \"But I\u0027m afraid old Mr. Jessie Compton died last year.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Bill said easily. \"That\u0027s why I came back. The land reverted to me, and since things have changed in our culture toward people of my particular persuasion, I decided to claim it.\"\\n\\n \"Did you know the Stackhouses? Sookie says you have a long history.\" I thought Gran had put it well. I smiled at my hands.\\n\\n \"I remember Jonas Stackhouse,\" Bill said, to Gran\u0027s delight. \"My folks were here when Bon Temps was just a hole in the road at the edge of the frontier. Jonas Stackhouse moved here with his wife and his four children when I was a young man of sixteen. Isn\u0027t this the house he built, at least in part?\"\\n\\n I noticed that when Bill was thinking of the past, his voice took on a different cadence and vocabulary. I wondered how many changes in slang and tone his English had taken on through the past century.\\n\\n Of course, Gran was in genealogical hog heaven. She wanted to know all about Jonas, her husband\u0027s great-great-great-great-grandfather. \"Did he own slaves?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Ma\u0027am, if I remember correctly, he had a house slave and a yard slave. The house slave was a woman of middle age and the yard slave a very big young man, very strong, named Minas. But the Stackhouses mostly worked their own fields, as did my folks.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that is exactly the kind of thing my little group would love to hear! Did Sookie tell you...\" Gran and Bill, after much polite do-si-doing, set a date for Bill to address a night meeting of the Descendants.\\n\\n \"And now, if you\u0027ll excuse Sookie and me, maybe we\u0027ll take a walk. It\u0027s a lovely night.\" Slowly, so I could see it coming, he reached over and took my hand, rising and pulling me to my feet, too. His hand was cold and hard and smooth. Bill wasn\u0027t quite asking Gran\u0027s permission, but not quite not, either.\\n\\n \"Oh, you two go on,\" my grandmother said, fluttering with happiness. \"I have so many things to look up. You\u0027ll have to tell me all the local names you remember from when you were...\" and here Gran ran down, not wanting to say something wounding.\\n\\n \"Resident here in Bon Temps,\" I supplied helpfully.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" the vampire said, and I could tell from the compression of his lips that he was trying not to smile.\\n\\n Somehow we were at the door, and I knew that Bill had lifted me and moved me quickly. I smiled, genuinely. I like the unexpected.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll be back in a while,\" I said to Gran. I didn\u0027t think she\u0027d noticed my odd transition, since she was gathering up our tea glasses.\\n\\n \"Oh, you two don\u0027t hurry on my account,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll be just fine.\"\\n\\n Outside, the frogs and toads and bugs were singing their nightly rural opera. Bill kept my hand as we strolled out into the yard, full of the smell of new-mown grass and budding things. My cat, Tina, came out of the shadows and asked to be tickled, and I bent over and scratched her head. To my surprise, the cat rubbed against Bill\u0027s legs, an activity he did nothing to discourage.\\n\\n \"You like this animal?\" he asked, his voice neutral.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my cat,\" I said. \"Her name is Tina, and I like her a lot.\"\\n\\n Without comment, Bill stood still, waiting until Tina went on her way into the darkness outside the porch light.\\n\\n \"Would you like to sit in the swing or the lawn chairs, or would you like to walk?\" I asked, since I felt I was now the hostess.\\n\\n \"Oh, let\u0027s walk for a while. I need to stretch my legs.\"\\n\\n Somehow this statement unsettled me a little, but I began moving down the long driveway in the direction of the two-lane parish road that ran in front of both our homes.\\n\\n \"Did the trailer upset you?\"\\n\\n I tried to think how to put it.\\n\\n \"I feel very ... hmmm. Fragile. When I think about the trailer.\"\\n\\n \"You knew I was strong.\"\\n\\n I tilted my head from side to side, considering. \"Yes, but I didn\u0027t realize the full extent of your strength,\" I told him. \"Or your imagination.\"\\n\\n \"Over the years, we get good at hiding what we\u0027ve done.\"\\n\\n \"So. I guess you\u0027ve killed a bunch of people.\"\\n\\n \"Some.\" Deal with it, his voice implied.\\n\\n I clasped both hands behind my back. \"Were you hungrier right after you became a vampire? How did that happen?\"\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t expected that. He looked at me. I could feel his eyes on me even though we were now in the dark. The woods were close around us. Our feet crunched on the gravel.\\n\\n \"As to how I became a vampire, that\u0027s too long a story for now,\" he said. \"But yes, when I was younger - a few times - I killed by accident. I was never sure when I\u0027d get to eat again, you understand? We were always hunted, naturally, and there was no such thing as artificial blood. And there were not as many people then. But I had been a good man when I was alive - I mean, before I caught the virus. So I tried to be civilized about it, select bad people as my victims, never feed on children. I managed never to kill a child, at least. It\u0027s so different now. I can go to the all-night clinic in any city and get some synthetic blood, though it\u0027s disgusting. Or I can pay a whore and get enough blood to keep going for a couple of days. Or I can glamor someone, so they\u0027ll let me bite them for love and then forget all about it. And I don\u0027t need so much now.\"\\n\\n \"Or you can meet a girl who gets head injuries,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Oh, you were the dessert. The Rattrays were the meal.\"\\n\\n Deal with it.\\n\\n \"Whoa,\" I said, feeling breathless. \"Give me a minute.\"\\n\\n And he did. Not one man in a million would have allowed me that time without speaking. I opened my mind, let my guards down completely, relaxed. His silence washed over me. I stood, closed my eyes, breathed out the relief that was too profound for words.\\n\\n \"Are you happy now?\" he asked, just as if he could tell.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I breathed. At that moment I felt that no matter what this creature beside me had done, this peace was priceless after a lifetime of the yammering of other minds inside my own.\\n\\n \"You feel good to me, too,\" he said, surprising me.\\n\\n \"How so?\" I asked, dreamy and slow.\\n\\n \"No fear, no hurry, no condemnation. I don\u0027t have to use my glamor to make you hold still, to have a conversation with you.\"\\n\\n \"Glamor?\"\\n\\n \"Like hypnotism,\" he explained. \"All vampires use it, to some extent or another. Because to feed, until the new synthetic blood was developed, we had to persuade people we were harmless ... or assure them they hadn\u0027t seen us at all ... or delude them into thinking they\u0027d seen something else.\"\\n\\n \"Does it work on me?\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" he said, sounding shocked.\\n\\n \"Okay, do it.\"\\n\\n \"Look at me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s dark.\"\\n\\n \"No matter. Look at my face.\" And he stepped in front of me, his hands resting lightly on my shoulders, and looked down at me. I could see the faint shine of his skin and eyes, and I peered up at him, wondering if I\u0027d begin to squawk like a chicken or take my clothes off.\\n\\n But what happened was ... nothing. I felt only the nearly druglike relaxation of being with him.\\n\\n \"Can you feel my influence?\" he asked. He sounded a little breathless.\\n\\n \"Not a bit, I\u0027m sorry,\" I said humbly. \"I just see you glow.\"\\n\\n \"You can see that?\" I\u0027d surprised him again.\\n\\n \"Sure. Can\u0027t everyone?\"\\n\\n \"No. This is strange, Sookie.\"\\n\\n \"If you say so. Can I see you levitate?\"\\n\\n \"Right here?\" Bill sounded amused.\\n\\n \"Sure, why not? Unless there\u0027s a reason?\"\\n\\n \"No, none at all.\" And he let go of my arms and began to rise.\\n\\n I breathed a sigh of pure rapture. He floated up in the dark, gleaming like white marble in the moonlight. When he was about two feet off the ground, he began hovering. I thought he was smiling down at me.\\n\\n \"Can all of you do that?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Can you sing?\"\\n\\n \"Nope, can\u0027t carry a tune.\"\\n\\n \"Well, we can\u0027t all do the same things, either.\" Bill came down slowly and landed on the ground without a thump. \"Most humans are squeamish about vampires. You don\u0027t seem to be,\" he commented.\\n\\n I shrugged. Who was I to be squeamish about something out of the ordinary? He seemed to understand because, after a pause, during which we\u0027d resumed walking, Bill said, \"Has it always been hard for you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, always.\" I couldn\u0027t say otherwise, though I didn\u0027t want to whine. \"When I was very small, that was worst, because I didn\u0027t know how to put up my guard, and I heard thoughts I wasn\u0027t supposed to hear, of course, and I repeated them like a child will. My parents didn\u0027t know what to do about me. It embarrassed my father, in particular. My mother finally took me to a child psychologist, who knew exactly what I was, but she just couldn\u0027t accept it and kept trying to tell my folks I was reading their body language and was very observant, so I had good reason to imagine I heard people\u0027s thoughts. Of course, she couldn\u0027t admit I was literally hearing people\u0027s thoughts because that just didn\u0027t fit into her world.\\n\\n \"And I did poorly in school because it was so hard for me to concentrate when so few others were. But when there was testing, I would test very high because the other kids were concentrating on their own papers ... that gave me a little leeway. Sometimes my folks thought I was lazy for not doing well on everyday work. Sometimes the teachers thought I had a learning disability; oh, you wouldn\u0027t believe the theories. I must have had my eyes and ears tested every two months, seemed like, and brain scans ... gosh. My poor folks paid through the nose. But they never could accept the simple truth. At least outwardly, you know?\"\\n\\n \"But they knew inside.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Once, when my dad was trying to decide whether to back a man who wanted to open an auto parts store, he asked me to sit with him when the man came to the house. After the man left, my dad took me outside and looked away and said, ¡®Sookie, is he telling the truth?\u0027 It was the strangest moment.\"\\n\\n \"How old were you?\"\\n\\n \"I must\u0027ve been less than seven\u0027cause they died when I was in the second grade.\"\\n\\n \"How?\"\\n\\n \"Flash flood. Caught them on the bridge west of here.\"\\n\\n Bill didn\u0027t comment. Of course, he\u0027d seen deaths piled upon deaths.\\n\\n \"Was the man lying?\" he asked after a few seconds had gone by.\\n\\n \"Oh, yes. He planned to take Daddy\u0027s money and run.\"\\n\\n \"You have a gift.\"\\n\\n \"Gift. Right.\" I could feel the corners of my mouth pull down.\\n\\n \"It makes you different from other humans.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re telling me.\" We walked for a moment in silence. \"So you don\u0027t consider yourself human at all?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t for a long time.\"\\n\\n \"Do you really believe you\u0027ve lost your soul?\" That was what the Catholic Church was preaching about vampires.\\n\\n \"I have no way of knowing,\" Bill said, almost casually. It was apparent that he\u0027d brooded over it so often it was quite a commonplace thought to him. \"Personally, I think not. There is something in me that isn\u0027t cruel, not murderous, even after all these years. Though I can be both.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not your fault you were infected with a virus.\"\\n\\n Bill snorted, even managing to sound elegant doing that. \"There have been theories as long as there have been vampires. Maybe that one is true.\" Then he looked as if he was sorry he\u0027d said that. \"If what makes a vampire is a virus,\" he went on in a more offhand manner, \"it\u0027s a selective one.\"\\n\\n \"How do you become a vampire?\" I\u0027d read all kinds of stuff, but this would be straight from the horse\u0027s mouth.\\n\\n \"I would have to drain you, at one sitting or over two or three days, to the point of your death, then give you my blood. You would lie like a corpse for about forty-eight hours, sometimes as long as three days, then rise and walk at night. And you would be hungry.\"\\n\\n The way he said \"hungry\" made me shiver.\\n\\n \"No other way?\"\\n\\n \"Other vampires have told me humans they habitually bite, day after day, can become vampires quite unexpectedly. But that requires consecutive, deep, feedings. Others, under the same conditions, merely become anemic. Then again, when people are near to death for some other reason, a car accident or a drug overdose, perhaps, the process can go ... badly wrong.\"\\n\\n I was getting the creepies. \"Time to change the subject. What do you plan on doing with the Compton land?\"\\n\\n \"I plan on living there, as long as I can. I\u0027m tired of drifting from city to city. I grew up in the country. Now that I have a legal right to exist, and I can go to Monroe or Shreveport or New Orleans for synthetic blood or prostitutes who specialize in our kind, I want to stay here. At least see if it\u0027s possible. I\u0027ve been roaming for decades.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of shape is the house in?\"\\n\\n \"Pretty bad,\" he admitted. \"I\u0027ve been trying to clean it out. That I can do at night. But I need workmen to get some repairs done. I\u0027m not bad at carpentry, but I don\u0027t know a thing about electricity.\"\\n\\n Of course, he wouldn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"It seems to me the house may need rewiring,\" Bill continued, sounding for all the world like any other anxious homeowner.\\n\\n \"Do you have a phone?\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" he said, surprised.\\n\\n \"So what\u0027s the problem with the workmen?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hard to get in touch with them at night, hard to get them to meet with me so I can explain what needs doing. They\u0027re scared, or they think it\u0027s a prank call.\" Frustration was evident in Bill\u0027s voice, though his face was turned away from me.\\n\\n I laughed. \"If you want, I\u0027ll call them,\" I offered. \"They know me. Even though everyone thinks I\u0027m crazy, they know I\u0027m honest.\"\\n\\n \"That would be a great favor,\" Bill said, after some hesitation. \"They could work during the day, after I\u0027d met with them to discuss the job and the cost.\"\\n\\n \"What an inconvenience, not being able to get out in the day,\" I said thoughtlessly. I\u0027d never really considered it before.\\n\\n Bill\u0027s voice was dry. \"It certainly is.\"\\n\\n \"And having to hide your resting place,\" I blundered on.\\n\\n When I felt the quality of Bill\u0027s silence, I apologized.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. If it hadn\u0027t been so dark, he would have seen me turn red.\\n\\n \"A vampire\u0027s daytime resting place is his most closely guarded secret,\" Bill said stiffly.\\n\\n \"I apologize.\"\\n\\n \"I accept,\" he said, after a bad little moment. We reached the road and looked up and down it as if we expected a taxi. I could see him clearly by the moonlight, now that we were out of the trees. He could see me, too. He looked me up and down.\\n\\n \"Your dress is the color of your eyes.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" I sure couldn\u0027t see him that clearly.\\n\\n \"Not a lot of it, though.\"\\n\\n \"Excuse me?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hard for me to get used to young ladies with so few clothes on,\" Bill said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve had a few decades to get used to it,\" I said tartly. \"Come on, Bill! Dresses have been short for forty years now!\"\\n\\n \"I liked long skirts,\" he said nostalgically. \"I liked the underthings women wore. The petticoats.\"\\n\\n I made a rude noise.\\n\\n \"Do you even have a petticoat?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I have a very pretty beige nylon slip with lace,\" I said indignantly. \"If you were a human guy, I\u0027d say you were angling for me to talk about my underwear!\"\\n\\n He laughed, that deep, unused chuckle that affected me so strongly. \"Do you have that slip on, Sookie?\"\\n\\n I stuck out my tongue at him because I knew he could see me. I edged the skirt of my dress up, revealing the lace of the slip and a couple more inches of tanned me.\\n\\n \"Happy?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"You have pretty legs, but I still like long dresses better.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re stubborn,\" I told him.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what my wife always told me.\"\\n\\n \"You were married.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I became a vampire when I was thirty. I had a wife, and I had five living children. My sister, Sarah, lived with us. She never wed. Her young man was killed in the war.\"\\n\\n \"The Civil War.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I came back from the battlefield. I was one of the lucky ones. At least I thought so at the time.\"\\n\\n \"You fought for the Confederacy,\" I said wonderingly. \"If you still had your uniform and wore it to the club, the ladies would faint with joy.\"\\n\\n \"I hadn\u0027t much of a uniform by the end of the war,\" he said grimly. \"We were in rags and starving.\" He seemed to shake himself. \"It had no meaning for me after I became vampire,\" Bill said, his voice once again chilly and remote.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve brought up something that upset you,\" I said. \"I am sorry. What should we talk about?\" We turned and began to stroll back down the driveway toward the house.\\n\\n \"Your life,\" he said. \"Tell me what you do when you get up in the morning.\"\\n\\n \"I get out of bed. Then I make it up right away. I eat breakfast. Toast, sometimes cereal, sometimes eggs, and coffee - and I brush my teeth and shower and dress. Sometimes I shave my legs, you know. If it\u0027s a workday, I go in to work. If I don\u0027t go in until night, I might go shopping, or take Gran to the store, or rent a movie to watch, or sunbathe. And I read a lot. I\u0027m lucky Gran is still spry. She does the wash and the ironing and most of the cooking.\"\\n\\n \"What about young men?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I told you about that. It\u0027s just impossible.\"\\n\\n \"So what will you do, Sookie?\" he asked gently.\\n\\n \"Grow old and die.\" My voice was short. He\u0027d touched on my sensitive area once too often.\\n\\n To my surprise, Bill reached over and took my hand. Now that we\u0027d made each other a little angry, touched some sore spots, the air seemed somehow clearer. In the quiet night, a breeze wafted my hair around my face.\\n\\n \"Take the clip out?\" Bill asked.\\n\\n No reason not to. I reclaimed my hand and reached up to open the clip. I shook my head to loosen my hair. I stuck the clip in his pocket, since I hadn\u0027t any. As if it was the most normal thing in the world, Bill began running his fingers through my hair, spreading it out on my shoulders.\\n\\n I touched his sideburns, since apparently touching was okay. \"They\u0027re long,\" I observed.\\n\\n \"That was the fashion,\" he said. \"It\u0027s lucky for me I didn\u0027t wear a beard as so many men did, or I\u0027d have it for eternity.\"\\n\\n \"You never have to shave?\"\\n\\n \"No, luckily I had just shaven.\" He seemed fascinated with my hair. \"In the moonlight, it looks silver,\" he said very quietly.\\n\\n \"Ah. What do you like to do?\"\\n\\n I could see a shadow of a smile in the darkness.\\n\\n \"I like to read, too.\" He thought. \"I like the movies ... of course, I\u0027ve followed their whole inception. I like the company of people who lead ordinary lives. Sometimes I crave the company of other vampires, though most of them lead very different lives from mine.\"\\n\\n We walked in silence for a moment.\\n\\n \"Do you like television?\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes,\" he confessed. \"For a while I taped soap operas and watched them at night when I thought I might be forgetting what it was like to be human. After a while I stopped, because from the examples I saw on those shows, forgetting humanity was a good thing.\" I laughed.\\n\\n We walked into the circle of light around the house. I had half-expected Gran to be on the porch swing waiting for us, but she wasn\u0027t. And only one dim bulb glowed in the living room. Really, Gran, I thought, exasperated. This was just like being brought home from a first date by a new man. I actually caught myself wondering if Bill would try to kiss me or not. With his views on long dresses, he would probably think it was out of line. But as stupid as kissing a vampire might seem, I realized that was what I really wanted to do, more than anything.\\n\\n I got a tight feeling in my chest, a bitterness, at another thing I was denied. And I thought, Why not?\\n\\n I stopped him by pulling gently on his hand. I stretched up and lay my lips on his shining cheek. I inhaled the scent of him, ordinary but faintly salty. He was wearing a trace of cologne.\\n\\n I felt him shudder. He turned his head so his lips touched mine. After a moment, I reached to circle his neck with my arms. His kiss deepened, and I parted my lips. I\u0027d never been kissed like this. It went on and on until I thought the whole world was involved in this kiss in the vampire\u0027s mouth on mine. I could feel my breathing speeding up, and I began to want other things to happen.\\n\\n Suddenly Bill pulled back. He looked shaken, which pleased me no end. \"Good night, Sookie,\" he said, stroking my hair one last time.\\n\\n \"Good night, Bill,\" I said. I sounded pretty quavery myself. \"I\u0027ll try to call some electricians tomorrow. I\u0027ll let you know what they say.\"\\n\\n \"Come by the house tomorrow night - if you\u0027re off work?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said. I was still trying to gather myself.\\n\\n \"See you then. Thanks, Sookie.\" And he turned away to walk through the woods back over to his place. Once he reached the darkness, he was invisible.\\n\\n I stood staring like a fool, until I shook myself and went inside to go to bed.\\n\\n I spent an indecent amount of time lying awake in bed wondering if the undead could actually do - it. Also, I wondered if it would be possible to have a frank discussion with Bill about that. Sometimes he seemed very old-fashioned, sometimes he seemed as normal as the guy next door. Well, not really, but pretty normal.\\n\\n It seemed both wonderful and pathetic to me that the one creature I\u0027d met in years that I\u0027d want to have sex with was actually not human. My telepathy limited my options severely. I could have had sex just to have it, sure; but I had waited to have sex I could actually enjoy.\\n\\n What if we did it, and after all these years I discovered I had no talent for it? Or maybe it wouldn\u0027t feel good. Maybe all the books and movies exaggerated. Arlene, too, who never seemed to understand that her sex life was not something I wanted to hear about.\\n\\n I finally got to sleep, to have long, dark dreams.\\n\\n The next morning, between fielding Gran\u0027s questions about my walk with Bill and our future plans, I made some phone calls. I found two electricians, a plumber, and some other service people who gave me phone numbers where they could be reached at night and made sure they understood that a phone call from Bill Compton was not a prank.\\n\\n Finally, I was lying out in the sun turning toasty when Gran carried the phone out to me.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s your boss,\" she said. Gran liked Sam, and he must have said something to make her happy because she was grinning like a Cheshire cat.\\n\\n \"Hi, Sam,\" I said, maybe not sounding too glad because I knew something had gone wrong at work.\\n\\n \"Dawn didn\u0027t make it in, cher,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Oh ... hell,\" I said, knowing I\u0027d have to go in. \"I kind of have plans, Sam.\" That was a first. \"When do you need me?\"\\n\\n \"Could you just come in from five to nine? That would help out a lot.\"\\n\\n \"Am I gonna get another full day off?\"\\n\\n \"What about Dawn splitting a shift with you another night?\"\\n\\n I made a rude noise, and Gran stood there with a stern face. I knew I\u0027d get a lecture later. \"Oh, all right,\" I said grudgingly. \"See you at five.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Sookie,\" he said. \"I knew I could count on you.\"\\n\\n I tried to feel good about that. It seemed like a boring virtue. You can always count on Sookie to step in and help because she doesn\u0027t have a life!\\n\\n Of course, it would be fine to get to Bill\u0027s after nine. He\u0027d be up all night, anyway.\\n\\n Work had never seemed so slow. I had trouble concentrating enough to keep my guard intact because I was always thinking about Bill. It was lucky there weren\u0027t many customers, or I would have heard unwanted thoughts galore. As it was, I found out Arlene\u0027s period was late, and she was scared she was pregnant, and before I could stop myself I gave her a hug. She stared at me searchingly and then turned red in the face.\\n\\n \"Did you read my mind, Sookie?\" she asked, warning written in her voice. Arlene was one of the few people who simply acknowledged my ability without trying to explain it or categorizing me as a freak for possessing such an ability. She also didn\u0027t talk about it often or in any normal voice, I\u0027d noticed.\\n\\n \"Sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to,\" I apologized. \"I\u0027m just not focused today.\"\\n\\n \"All right, then. You stay out from now on, though.\" And Arlene, her flaming curls bobbing around her cheeks, shook her finger in my face.\\n\\n I felt like crying. \"Sorry,\" I said again and strode off into the storeroom to collect myself. I had to pull my face straight and hold in those tears.\\n\\n I heard the door open behind me.\\n\\n \"Hey, I said I was sorry, Arlene!\" I snapped, wanting to be left alone. Sometimes Arlene confused telepathy with psychic talent. I was scared she\u0027d ask me if she was really pregnant. She\u0027d be better off buying an early home pregnancy kit.\\n\\n \"Sookie.\" It was Sam. He turned me around with a hand on my shoulder. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n His voice was gentle and pushed me much closer to tears.\\n\\n \"You should sound mean so I won\u0027t cry!\" I said.\\n\\n He laughed, not a big laugh, a small one. He put an arm around me.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" He wasn\u0027t going to give up and go away.\\n\\n \"Oh, I...\" and I stopped dead. I\u0027d never, ever explicitly discussed my problem (that\u0027s how I thought of it) with Sam or anyone else. Everyone in Bon Temps knew the rumors about why I was strange, but no one seemed to realize that I had to listen to their mental clatter nonstop, whether I wanted to or not - every day, the yammer yammer yammer. . .\\n\\n \"Did you hear something that bothered you?\" His voice was quiet and matter-of-fact. He touched the middle of my forhead, to indicate he knew exactly how I could \"hear.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t help it, can you?\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\"\\n\\n \"Hate it, don\u0027t you, cher?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Not your fault then, is it?\"\\n\\n \"I try not to listen, but I can\u0027t always keep my guard up.\" I felt a tear I hadn\u0027t been able to quell start trickling down my cheek.\\n\\n \"Is that how you do it? How do you keep your guard up, Sookie?\"\\n\\n He sounded really interested, not as though he thought I was a basket case. I looked up, not very far, into Sam\u0027s prominent, brilliant blue eyes.\\n\\n \"I just ... it\u0027s hard to describe unless you can do it ... I pull up a fence - no, not a fence, it\u0027s like I\u0027m snapping together steel plates - between my brain and all others.\"\\n\\n \"You have to hold the plates up?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. It takes a lot of concentration. It\u0027s like dividing my mind all the time. That\u0027s why people think I\u0027m crazy. Half my brain is trying to keep the steel plates up, and the other half might be taking drink orders, so sometimes there\u0027s not a lot left over for coherent conversation.\" What a gush of relief I was feeling, just being able to talk about it.\\n\\n \"Do you hear words or just get impressions?\"\\n\\n \"Depends on who I\u0027m listening to. And their state. If they\u0027re drunk, or really disturbed, it\u0027s just pictures, impressions, intentions. If they\u0027re sober and sane it\u0027s words and some pictures.\"\\n\\n \"The vampire says you can\u0027t hear him.\"\\n\\n The idea of Bill and Sam having a conversation about me made me feel very peculiar. \"That\u0027s true,\" I admitted.\\n\\n \"Is that relaxing to you?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes.\" I meant it from my heart.\\n\\n \"Can you hear me, Sookie?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to try!\" I said hastily. I moved to the door of the storeroom and stood with my hand on the knob. I pulled a tissue from my shorts pocket and patted the tear track off my cheek. \"I\u0027ll have to quit if I read your mind, Sam! I like you, I like it here.\"\\n\\n \"Just try it sometime, Sookie,\" he said casually, turning to open a carton of whiskey with the razor-edged box cutter he kept in his pocket. \"Don\u0027t worry about me. You have a job as long as you want one.\"\\n\\n I wiped down a table Jason had spilled salt on. He\u0027d been in earlier to eat a hamburger and fries and down a couple of beers.\\n\\n I was turning over Sam\u0027s offer in my mind.\\n\\n I wouldn\u0027t try to listen to him today. He was ready for me. I\u0027d wait when he was busy doing something else. I\u0027d just sort of slip in and give him a listen. He\u0027d invited me, which was absolutely unique.\\n\\n It was kind of nice to be invited.\\n\\n I repaired my makeup and brushed my hair. I\u0027d worn it loose, since Bill had seemed to like that, and a darn nuisance it had been all evening. It was just about time to go, so I retrieved my purse from its drawer in Sam\u0027s office.\\n\\n T HE COMPTON HOUSE, like Gran\u0027s, was set back from the road. It was a bit more visible from the parish road than hers, and it had a view of the cemetery, which her house didn\u0027t. This was due (at least in part) to the Compton house\u0027s higher setting. It was on top of a knoll and it was fully two-storied. Gran\u0027s house had a couple of spare bedrooms upstairs, and an attic, but it was more like half a top story.\\n\\n At one point in the family\u0027s long history, the Comptons had had a very nice house. Even in the dark, it had a certain graciousness. But I knew in the daylight you could see the pillars were peeling, the wood siding was crooked, and the yard was simply a jungle. In the humid warmth of Louisiana, yard growth could get out of hand mighty quick, and old Mr. Compton had not been one to hire someone to do his yard work. When he\u0027d gotten too feeble, it had simply gone undone.\\n\\n The circular drive hadn\u0027t gotten fresh gravel in many years, and my car lurched to the front door. I saw that the house was all lit up, and I began to realize that the evening would not go like last evening. There was another car parked in front of the house, a Lincoln Continental, white with a dark blue top. A blue-on-white bumper sticker read VAMPIRES SUCK. A red and yellow one stated HONK IF YOU\u0027RE A BLOOD DONOR! The vanity plate read, simply, FANGS 1.\\n\\n If Bill already had company, maybe I should just go on home.\\n\\n But I had been invited and was expected. Hesitantly, I raised my hand and knocked.\\n\\n The door was opened by a female vampire.\\n\\n She glowed like crazy. She was at least five feet eleven and black. She was wearing spandex. An exercise bra in flamingo pink and matching calf-length leggings, with a man\u0027s white dress shirt flung on unbuttoned, constituted the vampire\u0027s ensemble.\\n\\n I thought she looked cheap as hell and most likely absolutely mouthwatering from a male point of view.\\n\\n \"Hey, little human chick,\" the vampire purred.\\n\\n And all of a sudden I realized I was in danger. Bill had warned me repeatedly that not all vampires were like him, and he had moments when he was not so nice, himself. I couldn\u0027t read this creature\u0027s mind, but I could hear cruelty in her voice.\\n\\n Maybe she had hurt Bill. Maybe she was his lover.\\n\\n All of this passed through my mind in a rush, but none of it showed on my face. I\u0027ve had years of experience in controlling my face. I could feel my bright smile snap on protectively, my spine straightened, and I said cheerfully, \"Hi! I was supposed to drop by tonight and give Bill some information. Is he available?\"\\n\\n The female vampire laughed at me, which was nothing I wasn\u0027t used to. My smile notched up a degree brighter. This critter radiated danger the way a light bulb gives off heat.\\n\\n \"This little human gal here says she has some information for you, Bill!\" she yelled over her (slim, brown, beautiful) shoulder.\\n\\n I tried not to let relief show in any way.\\n\\n \"You wanna see this little thing? Or shall I just give her a love bite?\"\\n\\n Over my dead body, I thought furiously, and then realized it might be just that.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t hear Bill speak, but the vampire stood back, and I stepped into the old house. Running wouldn\u0027t do any good; this vamp could undoubtedly bring me down before I\u0027d gone five steps. And I hadn\u0027t laid eyes on Bill, and I couldn\u0027t be sure he was all right until I saw him. I\u0027d brave this out and hope for the best. I\u0027m pretty good at doing that.\\n\\n The big front room was crammed with dark old furniture and people. No, not people, I realized after I\u0027d looked carefully; two people, and two more strange vampires.\\n\\n The two vampires were both male and white. One had a buzz cut and tattoos on every visible inch of his skin. The other was even taller than the woman, maybe six foot four, with a head of long rippling dark hair and a magnificent build.\\n\\n The humans were less impressive. The woman was blond and plump, thirty-five or older. She was wearing maybe a pound too much makeup. She looked as worn as an old boot. The man was another story. He was lovely, the prettiest man I\u0027d ever seen. He couldn\u0027t have been more than twenty-one. He was swarthy, maybe Hispanic, small and fine-boned. He wore denim cut-offs and nothing else. Except for makeup. I took that in my stride, but I didn\u0027t find it appealing.\\n\\n Then Bill moved and I saw him, standing in the shadows of the dark hall leading from the living room to the back of the house. I looked at him, trying to get my bearings in this unexpected situation. To my dismay, he didn\u0027t look at all reassuring. His face was very still, absolutely impenetrable. Though I couldn\u0027t believe I was even thinking it, it would have been great at that point to have had a peek into his mind.\\n\\n \"Well, we can have a wonderful evening now,\" the longhaired male vampire said. He sounded delighted. \"Is this a little friend of yours, Bill? She\u0027s so fresh.\"\\n\\n I thought of a few choice words I\u0027d learned from Jason.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027ll just excuse me and Bill a minute,\" I said very politely, as if this was a perfectly normal evening, \"I\u0027ve been arranging for workmen for the house.\" I tried to sound businesslike and impersonal, though wearing shorts and a T-shirt and Nikes does not inspire professional respect. But I hoped I conveyed the impression that nice people I encountered in the course of my working day could not possibly hold any threat of danger.\\n\\n \"And we heard Bill was on a diet of synthetic blood only,\" said the tattooed vampire. \"Guess we heard wrong, Diane.\"\\n\\n The female vampire cocked her head and gave me a long look. \"I\u0027m not so sure. She looks like a virgin to me.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t think Diane was talking hymens.\\n\\n I took a few casual steps toward Bill, hoping like hell he would defend me if worst came to worst, but finding myself not absolutely sure. I was still smiling, hoping he would speak, would move.\\n\\n And then he did. \"Sookie is mine,\" he said, and his voice was so cold and smooth it wouldn\u0027t have made a ripple in the water if it had been a stone.\\n\\n I looked at him sharply, but I had enough brains to keep my mouth shut.\\n\\n \"How good you been taking care of our Bill?\" Diane asked.\\n\\n \"None of your fucking business,\" I answered, using one of Jason\u0027s words and still smiling. I said I had a temper.\\n\\n There was a sharp little pause. Everyone, human and vampire, seemed to examine me closely enough to count the hairs on my arms. Then the tall male began to rock with laughter and the others followed suit. While they were yukking it up, I moved a few feet closer to Bill. His dark eyes were fixed on me - he wasn\u0027t laughing - and I got the distinct feeling he wished, just as much as I did, that I could read his mind.\\n\\n He was in some danger, I could tell. And if he was, then I was.\\n\\n \"You have a funny smile,\" said the tall male thoughtfully. I\u0027d liked him better when he was laughing.\\n\\n \"Oh, Malcolm,\" said Diane. \"All human women look funny to you.\"\\n\\n Malcolm pulled the human male to him and gave him a long kiss. I began to feel a little sick. That kind of stuff is private. \"This is true,\" Malcolm said, pulling away after a moment, to the small man\u0027s apparent disappointment. \"But there is something rare about this one. Maybe she has rich blood.\"\\n\\n \"Aw,\" said the blond woman, in a voice that could blister paint, \"That\u0027s just crazy Sookie Stackhouse.\"\\n\\n I looked at the woman with more attention. I recognized her at last, when I mentally erased a few miles of hard road and half the makeup. Janella Lennox had worked at Merlotte\u0027s for two weeks until Sam had fired her. She\u0027d moved to Monroe, Arlene had told me.\\n\\n The male vampire with the tattoos put his arm around Janella and rubbed her breasts. I could feel the blood drain out of my face. I was disgusted. It got worse. Janella, as lost to decency as the vampire, put her hand on his crotch and massaged.\\n\\n At least I saw clearly that vampires can sure have sex.\\n\\n I was less than excited about that knowledge at the moment.\\n\\n Malcolm was watching me, and I\u0027d showed my distaste.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s innocent,\" he said to Bill, with a smile full of anticipation.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s mine,\" Bill said again. This time his voice was more intense. If he\u0027d been a rattlesnake his warning could not have been clearer.\\n\\n \"Now, Bill, you can\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve been getting everything you need from that little thing,\" Diane said. \"You look pale and droopy. She ain\u0027t been taking good care of you.\"\\n\\n I inched a little closer to Bill.\\n\\n \"Here,\" offered Diane, whom I was beginning to hate, \"have a taste of Liam\u0027s woman or Malcolm\u0027s pretty boy, Jerry.\"\\n\\n Janella didn\u0027t react to being offered around, maybe because she was too busy unzipping Liam\u0027s jeans, but Malcolm\u0027s beautiful boyfriend, Jerry, slithered willingly over to Bill. I smiled as though my jaws were going to crack as he wrapped his arms around Bill, nuzzled Bill\u0027s neck, rubbed his chest against Bill\u0027s shirt.\\n\\n The strain in my vampire\u0027s face was terrible to see. His fangs slid out. I saw them fully extended for the first time. The synthetic blood was not answering all Bill\u0027s needs, all right.\\n\\n Jerry began licking a spot at the base of Bill\u0027s neck. Keeping my guard up was proving to be more than I could handle. Since three present were vampires, whose thoughts I couldn\u0027t hear, and Janella was fully occupied, that left Jerry. I listened and gagged.\\n\\n Bill, shaking with temptation, was actually bending to sink his fangs into Jerry\u0027s neck when I said, \"No! He has the Sino-virus!\"\\n\\n As if released from a spell, Bill looked at me over Jerry\u0027s shoulder. He was breathing heavily, but his fangs retracted. I took advantage of the moment by taking more steps. I was within a yard of Bill, now.\\n\\n \"Sino-AIDS,\" I said.\\n\\n Alcoholic and heavily drugged victims affected vampires temporarily, and some of them were said to enjoy that buzz; but the blood of a human with full-blown AIDS didn\u0027t, nor did sexually transmitted diseases, or any other bugs that plagued humans.\\n\\n Except Sino-AIDS. Even Sino-AIDS didn\u0027t kill vampires as surely as the AIDS virus killed humans, but it left the undead very weak for nearly a month, during which time it was comparatively easy to catch and stake them. And every now and then, if a vampire fed from an infected human more than once, the vampire actually died - redied? - without being staked. Still rare in the United States, Sino-AIDS was gaining a foothold around ports like New Orleans, with sailors and other travelers from many countries passing through the city in a partying mood.\\n\\n All the vampires were frozen, staring at Jerry as if he were death in disguise; and for them, perhaps, he was.\\n\\n The beautiful young man took me completely by surprise. He turned and leapt on me. He was no vampire, but he was strong, evidently only in the earliest stages of the virus, and he knocked me against the wall to my left. He circled my throat with one hand and lifted the other to punch me in the face. My arms were still coming up to defend myself when Jerry\u0027s hand was seized, and his body froze.\\n\\n \"Let go of her throat,\" Bill said in such a terrifying voice that I was scared myself. By now, the scares were just piling up so quickly I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever feel safe again. But Jerry\u0027s fingers didn\u0027t relax, and I made a little whimpering sound without wanting to at all. I slewed my eyes sideways, and when I looked at Jerry\u0027s gray face, I realized that Bill was holding his hand, Malcolm was gripping his legs, and Jerry was so frightened he couldn\u0027t grasp what was wanted of him.\\n\\n The room began to get fuzzy, and voices buzzed in and out. Jerry\u0027s mind was beating against mine. I was helpless to hold him out. His mind was clouded with visions of the lover who had passed the virus to Jerry, a lover who had left him for a vampire, a lover Jerry himself had murdered in a fit of jealous rage. Jerry was seeing his death coming from the vampires he had wanted to kill, and he was not satisfied that he had extracted enough vengeance with the vampires he had already infected.\\n\\n I could see Diane\u0027s face over Jerry\u0027s shoulder, and she was smiling.\\n\\n Bill broke Jerry\u0027s wrist.\\n\\n He screamed and collapsed on the floor. The blood began surging into my head again, and I almost fainted. Malcolm picked Jerry up and carried him over to the couch as casually as if Jerry were a rolled-up rug. But Malcolm\u0027s face was not as casual. I knew Jerry would be lucky if he died quickly.\\n\\n Bill stepped in front of me, taking Jerry\u0027s place. His fingers, the fingers that had just broken Jerry\u0027s wrist, massaged my neck as gently as my grandmother\u0027s would have done. He put a finger across my lips to make sure I knew to keep silent.\\n\\n Then, his arm around me, he turned to face the other vampires.\\n\\n \"This has all been very entertaining,\" Liam said. His voice was as cool as if Janella wasn\u0027t giving him a truly intimate massage there on the couch. He hadn\u0027t troubled himself to budge during the whole incident. He had newly visible tattoos I could never in this world have imagined. I was sick to my stomach. \"But I think we should be driving back to Monroe. We have to have a little talk with Jerry when he wakes up, right, Malcolm?\"\\n\\n Malcolm heaved the unconscious Jerry over his shoulder and nodded at Liam. Diane looked disappointed.\\n\\n \"But fellas,\" she protested. \"We haven\u0027t found out how this little gal knew.\"\\n\\n The two male vampires simultaneously switched their gaze to me. Quite casually, Liam took a second off to reach a climax. Yep, vampires could do it, all right. After a little sigh of completion, he said, \"Thanks, Janella. That\u0027s a good question, Malcolm. As usual, our Diane has cut to the quick.\" And the three visiting vampires laughed as if that was a very good joke, but I thought it was a scary one.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t speak yet, can you, sweetheart?\" Bill gave my shoulder a squeeze as he asked, as if I couldn\u0027t get the hint.\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n \"I could probably make her talk,\" Diane offered.\\n\\n \"Diane, you forget,\" Bill said gently.\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah. She\u0027s yours,\" Diane said. But she didn\u0027t sound cowed or convinced.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have to visit some other time,\" Bill said, and his voice made it clear the others had to leave or fight him.\\n\\n Liam stood, zipped up his pants, gestured to his human woman. \"Out, Janella, we\u0027re being evicted.\" The tattoos rippled across his heavy arms as he stretched. Janella ran her hands along his ribs as if she just couldn\u0027t get enough of him, and he swatted her away as lightly as if she\u0027d been a fly. She looked vexed, but not mortified as I would have been. This was not new treatment for Janella.\\n\\n Malcolm picked up Jerry and carried him out the front door without a word. If drinking from Jerry had given him the virus, Malcolm was not yet impaired. Diane went last, slinging a purse over her shoulder and casting a bright-eyed glance behind her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll leave you two lovebirds on your own, then. It\u0027s been fun, honey,\" she said lightly, and she slammed the door behind her.\\n\\n The minute I heard the car start up outside, I fainted.\\n\\n I\u0027d never done so in my life, and I hoped never to again, but I felt I had some excuse.\\n\\n I seemed to spend a lot of time around Bill unconscious. That was a crucial thought, and I knew it deserved a lot of pondering, but not just at that moment. When I came to, everything I\u0027d seen and heard rushed back, and I gagged for real. Immediately Bill bent me over the edge of the couch. But I managed to keep my food down, maybe because there wasn\u0027t much in my stomach.\\n\\n \"Do vampires act like that?\" I whispered. My throat was sore and bruised where Jerry had squeezed it. \"They were horrible.\"\\n\\n \"I tried to catch you at the bar when I found out you weren\u0027t at home,\" Bill said. His voice was empty. \"But you\u0027d left.\"\\n\\n Though I knew it wouldn\u0027t help a thing, I began crying. I was sure Jerry was dead by now, and I felt I should have done something about that, but I couldn\u0027t have kept silent when he was about to infect Bill. So many things about this short episode had upset me so deeply that I didn\u0027t know where to begin being upset. In maybe fifteen minutes I\u0027d been in fear of my life, in fear for Bill\u0027s life (well - existence), made to witness sex acts that should be strictly private, seen my potential sweetie in the throes of blood lust (emphasis on lust), and nearly been choked to death by a diseased hustler.\\n\\n On second thought, I gave myself full permission to cry. I sat up and wept and mopped my face with a handkerchief Bill handed me. My curiosity about why a vampire would need a handkerchief was just a little flicker of normality, drenched by the flood of my nervous tears.\\n\\n Bill had enough sense not to put his arms around me. He sat on the floor, and had the grace to keep his eyes averted while I mopped myself dry.\\n\\n \"When vampires live in nests,\" he said suddenly, \"they often become more cruel because they egg each other on. They see others like themselves constantly, and so they are reminded of how far from being human they are. They become laws unto themselves. Vampires like me, who live alone, are a little better reminded of their former humanity.\"\\n\\n I listened to his soft voice, going slowly through his thoughts as he made an attempt to explain the unexplainable to me.\\n\\n \"Sookie, our life is seducing and taking and has been for centuries, for some of us. Synthetic blood and grudging human acceptance isn\u0027t going to change that overnight - or over a decade. Diane and Liam and Malcolm have been together for fifty years.\"\\n\\n \"How sweet,\" I said, and my voice held something I\u0027d never heard from myself before: bitterness. \"Their golden wedding anniversary.\"\\n\\n \"Can you forget about this?\" Bill asked. His huge dark eyes came closer and closer. His mouth was about two inches from mine.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" The words jerked out of me. \"Do you know, I didn\u0027t know if you could do it?\"\\n\\n His eyebrows rose interrogatively. \"Do ... ?\"\\n\\n \"Get - \" and I stopped, trying to think of a pleasant way to put it. I\u0027d seen more crudity this evening than I\u0027d seen in my lifetime, and I didn\u0027t want to add to it. \"An erection,\" I said, avoiding his eyes.\\n\\n \"You know better now.\" He sounded like he was trying not to be amused. \"We can have sex, but we can\u0027t make children or have them. Doesn\u0027t it make you feel better, that Diane can\u0027t have a baby?\"\\n\\n My fuses blew. I opened my eyes and looked at him steadily. \"Don\u0027t - you - laugh - at - me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Sookie,\" he said, and his hand rose to touch my cheek.\\n\\n I dodged his hand and struggled to my feet. He didn\u0027t help me, which was a good thing, but he sat on the floor watching me with a still, unreadable face. Bill\u0027s fangs had retracted, but I knew he was still suffering from hunger. Too bad.\\n\\n My purse was on the floor by the front door. I wasn\u0027t walking very steadily, but I was walking. I pulled the list of electricians out of a pocket and lay it on a table.\\n\\n \"I have to go.\"\\n\\n He was in front of me suddenly. He\u0027d done one of those vampire things again. \"Can I kiss you good-bye?\" he asked, his hands down at his sides, making it so obvious he wouldn\u0027t touch me until I said green light.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said vehemently. \"I can\u0027t stand it after them.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll come see you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Maybe.\"\\n\\n He reached past me to open the door, but I thought he was reaching for me, and I flinched.\\n\\n I spun on my heel and almost ran to my car, tears blurring my vision again. I was glad the drive home was so short. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-until-dark-sookie-stackhouse-1/page-2.html","bookId":2191,"book":{"id":2191,"title":"Dead Until Dark (Sookie Stackhouse #1)","description":"Storyline: Dead Until Dark (Sookie Stackhouse #1) \\n Sookie Stackhouse is just a small-time cocktail waitress in small-town Louisiana.
