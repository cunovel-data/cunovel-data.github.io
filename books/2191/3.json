{"id":100636,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"THE PHONE WAS ringing. I pulled my pillow over my head. Surely Gran would get it? As the irritating noise persisted, I realized Gran must be gone shopping or outside working in the yard. I began squirming to the bed table, not happy but resigned. With the headache and regrets of someone who has a terrible hangover (though mine was emotional rather than alcohol induced) I stretched out a shaky hand and grabbed the receiver.\n \"Yes?\" I asked. It didn\u0027t come out quite right. I cleared my throat and tried again. \"Hello?\"\n \"Sookie?\"\n \"Um-hum. Sam?\"\n \"Yeah. Listen, cher, do me a favor?\"\n \"What?\" I was due to work today anyway, and I didn\u0027t want to hold down Dawn\u0027s shift and mine, too.\n \"Go by Dawn\u0027s place, and see what she\u0027s up to, would you? She won\u0027t answer her phone, and she hasn\u0027t come in. The delivery truck just pulled up, and I got to tell these guys where to put stuff.\"\n \"Now? You want me to go now?\" My old bed had never held on to me harder.\n \"Could you?\" For the first time, he seemed to grasp my unusual mood. I had never refused Sam anything.\n \"I guess so,\" I said, feeling tired all over again at the very idea. I wasn\u0027t too crazy about Dawn, and she wasn\u0027t too crazy about me. She was convinced I\u0027d read her mind and told Jason something she\u0027d been thinking about him, which had cause him to break up with her. If I took that kind of interest in Jason\u0027s romances, I\u0027d never have time to eat or sleep.\n I showered and pulled on my work clothes, moving sluggishly. All my bounce had gone flat, like soda with the top left off. I ate cereal and brushed my teeth and told Gran where I was going when I tracked her down; she\u0027d been outside planting petunias in a tub by the back door. She didn\u0027t seem to understand exactly what I meant, but smiled and waved anyway. Gran was getting a little more deaf every week, but I realized that was no great wonder since she was seventy-eight. It was marvelous that she was so strong and healthy, and her brain was sound as a bell.\n As I went on my unwelcome errand, I thought about how hard it must have been for Gran to raise two more children after she\u0027d already raised her own. My father, her son, had died when I was seven and Jason ten. When I\u0027d been twenty-three, Gran\u0027s daughter, my Aunt Linda, had died of uterine cancer. Aunt Linda\u0027s girl, Hadley, had vanished into the same subculture that had spawned the Rattrays even before Aunt Linda had passed away, and to this day we didn\u0027t know if Hadley realizes her mother is dead. That was a lot of grief to get through, yet Gran had always been strong for us.\n I peered through my windshield at the three small duplexes on one side of Berry Street, a run-down block or two that ran behind the oldest part of downtown Bon Temps. Dawn lived in one of them. I spotted her car, a green compact, in the driveway of one of the better-kept houses, and pulled in behind it. Dawn had already put a hanging basket of begonias by her front door, but they looked dry. I knocked.\n I waited for a minute or two. I knocked again.\n \"Sookie, you need some help?\" The voice sounded familiar. I turned around and shielded my eyes from the morning sun. Rene Lenier was standing by his pickup, parked across the street at one of the small frame houses that populated the rest of the neighborhood.\n \"Well,\" I began, not sure if I needed help or not, or if I did that Rene could supply it. \"Have you seen Dawn? She didn\u0027t come to work today, and she never called in yesterday. Sam asked me to stop by.\"\n \"Sam should come do his own dirty work,\" Rene said, which perversely made me defend my boss.\n \"Truck came in, had to be unloaded.\" I turned and knocked again. \"Dawn,\" I yelled. \"Come let me in.\" I looked down at the concrete porch. The pine pollen had begun falling two days ago. Dawn\u0027s porch was solid yellow. Mine were the only footprints. My scalp began to prickle.\n I barely registered the fact that Rene stood awkwardly by the door to his pickup, unsure whether to stay or go.\n Dawn\u0027s duplex was a one-story, quite small, and the door to the other half was just feet away from Dawn\u0027s. Its little driveway was empty, and there were no curtains at the windows. It looked as though Dawn was temporarily out of a neighbor. Dawn had been proud enough to hang curtains, white with dark gold flowers. They were drawn, but the fabric was thin and unlined, and Dawn hadn\u0027t shut the cheap one-inch aluminum blinds. I peered in and discovered the living room held only some flea-market furniture. A coffee mug sat on the table by a lumpy recliner and an old couch covered with a hand-crocheted afghan was pushed against the wall.\n \"I think I\u0027ll go around back,\" I called to Rene. He started across the street as though I\u0027d given him a signal, and I stepped off the front porch. My feet brushed the dusty grass, yellow with pine pollen, and I knew I\u0027d have to dust off my shoes and maybe change my socks before work. During pine pollen season, everything turns yellow. Cars, plants, roofs, windows, all are powdered with a golden haze. The ponds and pools of rainwater have yellow scum around the edges.\n Dawn\u0027s bathroom window was so discreetly high that I couldn\u0027t see in. She\u0027d lowered the blinds in the bedroom, but hadn\u0027t closed them tightly. I could see a little through the slats. Dawn was in bed on her back. The bedclothes were tossed around wildly. Her legs were spraddled. Her face was swollen and discolored, and her tongue protruded from her mouth. There were flies crawling on it.\n I could hear Rene coming up behind me.\n \"Go call the police,\" I said.\n \"What you say, Sookie? You see her?\"\n \"Go call the police!\"\n \"Okay, okay!\" Rene beat a hasty retreat.\n Some female solidarity had made me not want Rene to see Dawn like that, without Dawn\u0027s consent. And my fellow waitress was far beyond consenting.\n I stood with my back to the window, horribly tempted to look again in the futile hope I\u0027d made a mistake the first time. Staring at the duplex next door to Dawn\u0027s, maybe a scant six feet away, I wondered how its tenants could have avoided hearing Dawn\u0027s death, which had been violent.\n Here came Rene again. His weatherbeaten face was puckered into an expression of deep concern, and his bright brown eyes looked suspiciously shiney.\n \"Would you call Sam, too?\" I asked. Without a word, he turned and trudged back to his place. He was being mighty good. Despite his tendency to gossip, Rene had always been one to help where he saw a need. I remembered him coming out to the house to help Jason hang Gran\u0027s porch swing, a random memory of a day far different from this.\n The duplex next door was just like Dawn\u0027s, so I was looking directly at its bedroom window. Now a face appeared, and the window was raised. A tousled head poked out. \"What you doing, Sookie Stackhouse?\" asked a slow, deep, male voice. I peered at him for a minute, finally placing the face, while trying not to look too closely at the fine, bare chest underneath.\n \"JB?\"\n \"Sure thing.\"\n I\u0027d gone to high school with JB du Rone. In fact, some of my few dates had been with JB, who was lovely but so simple that he didn\u0027t care if I read his mind or not. Even under today\u0027s circumstances, I could appreciate JB\u0027s beauty. When your hormones have been held in check as long as mine, it doesn\u0027t take much to set them off. I heaved a sigh at the sight of JB\u0027s muscular arms and pectorals.\n \"What you doing out here?\" he asked again.\n \"Something bad seems to have happened to Dawn,\" I said, not knowing if I should tell him or not. \"My boss sent me here to look for her when she didn\u0027t come to work.\"\n \"She in there?\" JB simply scrambled out of the window. He had some shorts on, cut-offs.\n \"Please don\u0027t look,\" I asked, holding up my hand and without warning I began crying. I was doing that a lot lately, too. \"She looks so awful, JB.\"\n \"Aw, honey,\" he said, and bless his country heart, he put an arm around me and patted me on the shoulder. If there was a female around who needed comforting, by God, that was a priority to JB du Rone.\n \"Dawn liked\u0027em rough,\" he said consolingly, as if that would explain everything.\n It might to some people, but not to unworldly me.\n \"What, rough?\" I asked, hoping I had a tissue in my shorts pocket.\n I looked up at JB to see him turn a little red.\n \"Honey, she liked ... aw, Sookie, you don\u0027t need to hear this.\"\n I had a widespread reputation for virtue, which I found somewhat ironic. At the moment, it was inconvenient.\n \"You can tell me, I worked with her,\" I said, and JB nodded solemnly, as if that made sense.\n \"Well, honey, she liked men to - like, bite and hit her.\" JB looked weirded out by this preference of Dawn\u0027s. I must have made a face because he said, \"I know, I can\u0027t understand why some people like that, either.\" JB, never one to ignore an opportunity to make hay, put both arms around me and kept up the patting, but it seemed to concentrate on the middle of my back (checking to see if I was wearing a bra) and then quite a bit lower (JB liked firm rear ends, I remembered.)\n A lot of questions hovered on the edge of my tongue, but they remained shut inside my mouth. The police got there, in the persons of Kenya Jones and Kevin Prior. When the town police chief had partnered Kenya and Kevin, he\u0027d been indulging his sense of humor, the town figured, for Kenya was at least five foot eleven, the color of bitter chocolate, and built to weather hurricanes. Kevin possibly made it up to five foot eight, had freckles over every visible inch of his pale body, and had the narrow, fatless build of a runner. Oddly enough, the two K\u0027s got along very well, though they\u0027d had some memorable quarrels.\n Now they both looked like cops.\n \"What\u0027s this about, Miss Stackhouse?\" Kenya asked. \"Rene says something happened to Dawn Green?\" She\u0027d scanned JB while she talked, and Kevin was looking at the ground all around us. I had no idea why, but I was sure there was a good police reason.\n \"My boss sent me here to find out why Dawn missed work yesterday and hadn\u0027t shown up today,\" I said. \"I knocked on her door, and she didn\u0027t answer, but her car was here. I was worried about her, so I started around the house looking in the windows, and she\u0027s in there.\" I pointed behind them, and the two officers turned to look at the window. Then they looked at each other and nodded as if they\u0027d had a whole conversation. While Kenya went over to the window, Kevin went around to the back door.\n JB had forgotten to pat while he watched the officers work. In fact, his mouth was a little open, revealing perfect teeth. He wanted to go look through the window more than anything, but he couldn\u0027t shoulder past Kenya, who pretty much took up whatever space was available.\n I didn\u0027t want my own thoughts any more. I relaxed, dropping my guard, and listened to the thoughts of others. Out of the clamor, I picked one thread and concentrated on it.\n Kenya Jones turned back to stare through us without seeing us. She was thinking of everything she and Kevin needed to do to keep the investigation as textbook perfect as Bon Temps patrol officers could. She was thinking she\u0027d heard bad things about Dawn and her liking for rough sex. She was thinking that it was no surprise Dawn had met a bad end, though she felt sorry for anyone who ended up with flies crawling on her face. Kenya was thinking she was sorry she\u0027d eaten that extra doughnut that morning at the Nut Hut because it might come back up and that would shame her as a black woman police officer.\n I tuned in to another channel.\n JB was thinking about Dawn getting killed during rough sex just a few feet away from him, and while it was awful it was also a little exciting and Sookie was still built wonderful. He wished he could screw her right now. She was so sweet and nice. He was pushing away the humiliation he\u0027d felt when Dawn had wanted him to hit her, and he couldn\u0027t, and it was an old humiliation.\n I switched.\n Kevin came around the corner thinking that he and Kenya better not botch any evidence and that he was glad no one knew he\u0027d ever slept with Dawn Green. He was furious that someone had killed a woman he knew, and he was hoping it wasn\u0027t a black man because that would make his relationship with Kenya even more tense.\n I switched.\n Rene Lenier was wishing someone would come and get the body out of the house. He was hoping no one knew he\u0027d slept with Dawn Green. I couldn\u0027t spell out his thoughts exactly, they were very black and snarled. Some people I can\u0027t get a clear reading on. He was very agitated.\n Sam came hurrying toward me, slowing down when he saw JB was touching me. I could not read Sam\u0027s thoughts. I could feel his emotions (right now a mix of worry, concern, and anger) but I could not spell out one single thought. This was so fascinating and unexpected that I stepped out of JB\u0027s embrace, wanting to go up to Sam and grab his arms and look into his eyes and really probe around in his head. I remembered when he\u0027d touched me, and I\u0027d shied away. Now he felt me in his head and though he kept on walking toward me, his mind flinched back. Despite his invitation to me, he hadn\u0027t known I would see he was different from others: I picked up on that until he shut me down.\n I\u0027d never felt anything like it. It was like an iron door slamming. In my face.\n I\u0027d been on the point of reaching out to him instinctively, but my hand dropped to my side. Sam deliberately looked at Kevin, not at me.\n \"What\u0027s happening, Officer?\" Sam asked.\n \"We\u0027re going to break into this house, Mr. Merlotte, unless you have a master key.\"\n Why would Sam have a key?\n \"He\u0027s my landlord,\" JB said in my ear, and I jumped.\n \"He is?\" I asked stupidly.\n \"He owns all three duplexes.\"\n Sam had been fishing in his pocket, and now he came up with a bunch of keys. He flipped through them expertly, stopping at one and singling it out, getting it off the ring and handing it to Kevin.\n \"This fits front and back?\" Kevin asked. Sam nodded. He still wasn\u0027t looking at me.\n Kevin went to the back door of the duplex, out of sight, and we were all so quiet we could hear the key turn in the lock. Then he was in the bedroom with the dead woman, and we could see his face twist when the smell hit him. Holding one hand across his mouth and nose, he bent over the body and put his fingers on her neck. He looked out the window then and shook his head at his partner. Kenya nodded and headed out to the street to use the radio in the patrol car.\n \"Listen, Sookie, how about going to dinner with me tonight?\" JB asked. \"This has been tough on you, and you need some fun to make up for it.\"\n \"Thanks, JB.\" I was very conscious of Sam listening. \"It\u0027s really nice of you to ask. But I have a feeling I\u0027m going to be working extra hours today.\"\n For just a second, JB\u0027s handsome face was blank. Then comprehension filtered in. \"Yeah, Sam\u0027s gotta hire someone else,\" he observed. \"I got a cousin in Springhill needs a job. Maybe I\u0027ll give her a call. We could live right next door to each other, now.\"\n I smiled at him, though I am sure it was a very weak smile, as I stood shoulder to shoulder with the man I\u0027d worked with for two years.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Sookie,\" he said quietly.\n \"For what?\" My own voice was just as low. Was he going to acknowledge what had passed between us - or rather, failed to pass?\n \"For sending you to check on Dawn. I should have come myself. I was sure she was just shacked up with someone new and needed a reminder that she was supposed to be working. The last time I had to come get her, she yelled at me so much I just didn\u0027t want to deal with it again. So like a coward, I sent you, and you had to find her like that.\"\n \"You\u0027re full of surprises, Sam.\"\n He didn\u0027t turn to look at me or make any reply. But his fingers folded around mine. For a long moment, we stood in the sun with people buzzing around us, holding hands. His palm was hot and dry, and his fingers were strong. I felt I had truly connected with another human. But then his grip loosened, and Sam stepped over to talk with the detective, who was emerging from his car, and JB began asking me how Dawn had looked, and the world fell back into its same old groove.\n The contrast was cruel. I felt tired all over again, and remembered the night before in more detail than I wanted to. The world seemed a bad and terrible place, all its denizens suspect, and I the lamb wandering through the valley of death with a bell around my neck. I stomped over to my car and opened the door, sank sideways into the seat. I\u0027d be standing plenty today; I\u0027d sit while I could.\n JB followed me. Now that he\u0027d rediscovered me, he could not be detached. I remembered when Gran had had high hopes for some permanent relationship between us, when I\u0027d been in high school. But talking to JB, even reading his mind, was as interesting as a kindergarten primer was to an adult reader. It was one of God\u0027s jokes that such a dumb mind had been put in such an eloquent body.\n He knelt before me and took my hand. I found myself hoping that some smart rich lady would come along and marry JB and take care of him and enjoy what he had to offer. She would be getting a bargain.\n \"Where are you working now?\" I asked him, just to distract myself.\n \"My dad\u0027s warehouse,\" he said.\n That was the job of last resort, the one JB always returned to when he got fired from other jobs for doing something lamebrained, or for not showing up, or for offending some supervisor mortally. JB\u0027s dad ran an auto parts store.\n \"How are your folks doing?\"\n \"Oh, fine. Sookie, we should do something together.\"\n Don\u0027t tempt me, I thought.\n Someday my hormones were going to get the better of me and I\u0027d do something I\u0027d regret; and I could do worse than do it with JB. But I would hold out and hope for something better. \"Thanks, honey,\" I said. \"Maybe we will. But I\u0027m kind of upset right now.\"\n \"Are you in love with that vampire?\" he asked directly.\n \"Where did you hear that?\"\n \"Dawn said so.\" JB\u0027s face clouded as he remembered Dawn was dead. What Dawn had said, I found on scanning JB\u0027s mind, was \"That new vampire is interested in Sookie Stackhouse. I\u0027d be better for him. He needs a woman who can take some rough treatment. Sookie would scream if he touched her.\"\n It was pointless being mad at a dead person, but briefly I indulged myself by doing just that.\n Then the detective was walking toward us, and JB got to his feet and moved away.\n The detective took JB\u0027s position, squatting on the ground in front of me. I must look in bad shape.\n \"Miss Stackhouse?\" he asked. He was using that quiet intense voice many professionals adopt in a crisis. \"I\u0027m Andy Bellefleur.\" The Bellefleurs had been around Bon Temps as long as there\u0027d been a Bon Temps, so I wasn\u0027t amused at a man being \"beautiful flower.\" In fact, I felt sorry for whoever thought it was amusing as I looked down at the block of muscle that was Detective Bellefleur. This particular family member had graduated before Jason, and I\u0027d been one class behind his sister Portia.\n He\u0027d been placing me, too. \"Your brother doing okay?\" he asked, his voice still quiet, not quite as neutral. It sounded like he\u0027d had a run-in or two with Jason.\n \"The little I see of him, he\u0027s doing fine,\" I answered.\n \"And your grandmother?\"\n I smiled. \"She\u0027s out planting flowers this morning.\"\n \"That\u0027s wonderful,\" he said, doing that sincere head shake that\u0027s supposed to indicate admiring amazement. \"Now, I understand that you work at Merlotte\u0027s?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"And so did Dawn Green?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"When was the last time you saw Dawn?\"\n \"Two days ago. At work.\" I already felt exhausted. Without shifting my feet from the ground or my arm from the steering wheel, I lay my head sideways on the headrest of the driver\u0027s seat.\n \"Did you talk to her then?\"\n I tried to remember. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"Were you close to Miss Green?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"And why did you come here today?\"\n I explained about working for Dawn yesterday, about Sam\u0027s phone call this morning.\n \"Did Mr. Merlotte tell you why he didn\u0027t want to come here himself?\"\n \"Yes, a truck was there to unload. Sam has to show the guys where to put the boxes.\" Sam also did a lot of the unloading himself, half the time, to speed up the process.\n \"Do you think Mr. Merlotte had any relationship with Dawn?\"\n \"He was her boss.\"\n \"No, outside work.\"\n \"Nope.\"\n \"You sound pretty positive.\"\n \"I am.\"\n \"Do you have a relationship with Sam?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Then how are you so sure?\"\n Good question. Because from time to time I\u0027d heard thoughts that indicated that if she didn\u0027t hate Sam, Dawn sure as hell wasn\u0027t real fond of him? Not too smart a thing to tell the detective.\n \"Sam keeps everything real professional at the bar,\" I said. It sounded lame, even to me. It just happened to be the truth.\n \"Did you know anything about Dawn\u0027s personal life?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"You weren\u0027t friendly?\"\n \"Not particularly.\" My thoughts drifted as the detective bent his head in thought. At least that was what it looked like.\n \"Why is that?\"\n \"I guess we didn\u0027t have anything in common.\"\n \"Like what? Give me an example.\"\n I sighed heavily, blowing my lips out in exasperation. If we didn\u0027t have anything in common, how could I give him an example?\n \"Okay,\" I said slowly. \"Dawn had a real active social life, and she liked to be with men. She wasn\u0027t so crazy about spending time with women. Her family is from Monroe, so she didn\u0027t have family ties here. She drank, and I don\u0027t. I read a lot, and she didn\u0027t. That enough?\"\n Andy Bellefleur scanned my face to see if I was giving him attitude. He must have been reassured by what he saw.\n \"So, you two didn\u0027t ever see each other after working hours?\"\n \"That\u0027s correct.\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t it seem strange to you that Sam Merlotte asked you to check on Dawn, then?\"\n \"No, not at all,\" I said stoutly. At least, it didn\u0027t seem strange now, after Sam\u0027s description of Dawn\u0027s tantrum. \"This is on my way to the bar, and I don\u0027t have children like Arlene, the other waitress on our shift. So it would be easier for me.\" That was pretty sound, I thought. If I said Dawn had screamed at Sam the last time he\u0027d been here, that would give exactly the wrong impression.\n \"What did you do after work two days ago, Sookie?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t come to work. I had the day off.\"\n \"And your plan for that day was - ?\"\n \"I sunbathed and helped Gran clean house, and we had company.\"\n \"Who would that be?\"\n \"That would be Bill Compton.\"\n \"The vampire.\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"How late was Mr. Compton at your house?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe midnight or one.\"\n \"How did he seem to you?\"\n \"He seemed fine.\"\n \"Edgy? Irritated?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Miss Stackhouse, we need to talk to you more at the station house. This is going to take awhile, here, as you can see.\"\n \"Okay, I guess.\"\n \"Can you come in a couple of hours?\"\n I looked at my wristwatch. \"If Sam doesn\u0027t need me to work.\"\n \"You know, Miss Stackhouse, this really takes precedence over working at a bar.\"\n Okay, I was pissed off. Not because he thought murder investigations were more important than getting to work on time; I agreed with him, there. It was his unspoken prejudice against my particular job.\n \"You may not think my job amounts to much, but it\u0027s one I\u0027m good at, and I like it. I am as worthy of respect as your sister, the lawyer, Andy Bellefleur, and don\u0027t you forget it. I am not stupid, and I am not a slut.\"\n The detective turned red, slowly and unattractively. \"I apologize,\" Andy said stiffly. He was still trying to deny the old connection, the shared high school, the knowledge of each other\u0027s family. He was thinking he should have been a detective in another town, where he could treat people the way he thought a police officer should.\n \"No, you\u0027ll be a better detective here if you can get over that attitude,\" I told him. His gray eyes flared wide in shock, and I was childishly glad I\u0027d rocked him, though I was sure I would pay for it sooner or later. I always did when I gave people a peek at my disability.\n Mostly, people couldn\u0027t get away from me fast enough when I\u0027d given them a taste of mind reading, but Andy Bellefleur was fascinated. \"It\u0027s true, then,\" he breathed, as if we were somewhere alone instead of sitting in the driveway of a rundown duplex in rural Louisiana.\n \"No, forget it,\" I said quickly. \"I can just tell sometimes by the way people look what they\u0027re thinking.\"\n He deliberately thought about unbuttoning my blouse. But I was wary now, back to my normal state of barricaded seige, and I did no more than smile brightly. I could tell I wasn\u0027t fooling him, though.\n \"When you\u0027re ready for me, you come to the bar. We can talk in the storeroom or Sam\u0027s office,\" I said firmly and swung my legs into the car.\n The bar was buzzing when I got there. Sam had called Terry Bellefleur, Andy\u0027s second cousin if I recalled correctly, in to watch the bar while he talked to the police at Dawn\u0027s place. Terry had had a bad war in Vietnam, and he existed narrowly on government disability of some kind. He\u0027d been wounded, captured, held prisoner for two years, and now his thoughts were most often so scary that I was extra special careful when I was around him. Terry had a hard life, and acting normal was even harder for him than it was for me. Terry didn\u0027t drink, thank God.\n Today I gave him a light kiss on the cheek while I got my tray and scrubbed my hands. Through the window into the little kitchen I could see Lafayette Reynold, the cook, flipping burgers and sinking a basket of fries into hot oil. Merlotte\u0027s serves a few sandwiches, and that\u0027s all. Sam doesn\u0027t want to run a restaurant, but a bar with some food available.\n \"What was that for, not that I\u0027m not honored,\" Terry said. He\u0027d raised his eyebrows. Terry was redhaired, though when he needed a shave, I could tell his whiskers were gray. Terry spent a lot of time outside, but his skin never exactly tanned. It got a rough, reddened look, which made the scars on his left cheek stand out more clearly. That didn\u0027t seem to bother Terry. Arlene had been to bed with Terry one night when she\u0027d been drinking, and she\u0027d confided in me that Terry had many scars even worse than the one on his cheek.\n \"Just for being here,\" I said.\n \"It true about Dawn?\"\n Lafayette put two plates on the serving hatch. He winked at me with a sweep of his thick, false lashes. Lafayette wears a lot of makeup. I was so used to him I never thought of it any more, but now his eye shadow brought the boy, Jerry, to my mind. I\u0027d let him go with the three vampires without protest. That had probably been wrong, but realistic. I couldn\u0027t have stopped them from taking him. I couldn\u0027t have gotten the police to catch up with them in time. He was dying anyway, and he was taking as many vampires and humans with him as he could; and he was already a killer himself. I told my conscience this would be the last talk we\u0027d have about Jerry.\n \"Arlene, burgers up,\" Terry called, jerking me back into the here and how. Arlene came over to grab the plates. She gave me a look that said she was going to pump me dry at the first chance she got. Charlsie Tooten was working, too. She filled in when one of the regular women got sick or just didn\u0027t show. I hoped Charlsie would take Dawn\u0027s place full-time. I\u0027d always liked her.\n \"Yeah, Dawn\u0027s dead,\" I told Terry. He didn\u0027t seem to mind my long pause.\n \"What happened to her?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, but it wasn\u0027t peaceful.\" I\u0027d seen blood on the sheets, not a lot, but some.\n \"Maudette,\" Terry said, and I instantly understood.\n \"Maybe,\" I said. It sure was possible that whoever had done in Dawn was the same person who\u0027d killed Maudette.\n Of course, everyone in Renard Parish came in that day, if not for lunch, then for an afternoon cup of coffee or a beer. If they couldn\u0027t make their work schedule bend around that, they waited until they clocked out and came in on their way home. Two young women in our town murdered in one month? You bet people wanted to talk.\n Sam returned about two, with heat radiating off his body and sweat trickling down his face from standing out in the shadeless yard at the crime scene. He told me that Andy Bellefleur had said he was coming to talk to me again soon.\n \"I don\u0027t know why,\" I said, maybe a tad sullenly. \"I never hung around with Dawn. What happened to her, did they tell you?\"\n \"Someone strangled her after beating on her a little,\" Sam said. \"But she had some old tooth marks, too. Like Maudette.\"\n \"There are lots of vampires, Sam,\" I said, answering his unspoken comment.\n \"Sookie.\" His voice was so serious and quiet. It made me remember how he\u0027d held my hand at Dawn\u0027s house, and then I remembered how he\u0027d shut me out of his mind, known I was probing, known how to keep me out. \"Honey, Bill is a good guy, for a vampire, but he\u0027s just not human.\"\n \"Honey, neither are you,\" I said, very quietly but very sharply. And I turned my back on Sam, not exactly wanting to admit why I was so angry with him, but wanting him to know it nonetheless.\n I worked like a demon. Whatever her faults, Dawn had been efficient, and Charlsie just couldn\u0027t keep up with the pace. She was willing, and I was sure she\u0027d catch up with the rhythm of the bar, but for tonight, Arlene and I had to take up the slack.\n I earned a ton of money in tips that evening and on into the night when people found out I\u0027d actually discovered the body. I just kept my face solemn and got through it, not wanting to offend customers who just wanted to know what everyone else in town wanted to know.\n On my way home, I allowed myself to relax a little. I was exhausted. The last thing I expected to see, after I turned into the little drive through the woods that led to our house, was Bill Compton. He was leaning against a pine tree waiting for me. I drove past him a little, almost deciding to ignore him. But then I stopped.\n He opened my door. Without looking him in the eyes, I got out. He seemed comfortable in the night, in a way I never could be. There were too many childhood taboos about the night and the darkness and things that went bump.\n Come to think of it, Bill was one of those things. No wonder he felt at ease.\n \"Are you going to look at your feet all night, or are you going to talk to me?\" he asked in a voice that was just above a whisper.\n \"Something happened you should know about.\"\n \"Tell me.\" He was trying to do something to me: I could feel his power hovering around me, but I batted it away. He sighed.\n \"I can\u0027t stand up,\" I said wearily. \"Let\u0027s sit on the ground or something. My feet are tired.\"\n In answer, he picked me up and set me on the hood of the car. Then he stood in front of me, his arms crossed, very obviously waiting.\n \"Tell me.\"\n \"Dawn was murdered. Just like Maudette Pickens.\"\n \"Dawn?\"\n Suddenly I felt a little better. \"The other waitress at the bar.\"\n \"The redheaded one, the one who\u0027s been married so often?\"\n I felt a lot better. \"No, the dark-haired one, the one who kept bumping into your chair with her hips to get you to notice her.\"\n \"Oh, that one. She came to my house.\"\n \"Dawn? When?\"\n \"After you left the other night. The night the other vampires were there. She\u0027s lucky she missed them. She was very confident of her ability to handle anything.\"\n I looked up at him. \"Why is she so lucky? Wouldn\u0027t you have protected her?\"\n Bill\u0027s eyes were totally dark in the moonlight. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he said.\n \"You are...\"\n \"I\u0027m a vampire, Sookie. I don\u0027t think like you. I don\u0027t care about people automatically.\"\n \"You protected me.\"\n \"You\u0027re different.\"\n \"Yeah? I\u0027m a waitress, like Dawn. I come from a plain family, like Maudette. What\u0027s so different?\"\n I was in a sudden rage. I knew what was coming.\n His cool finger touched the middle of my forehead. \"Different,\" he said. \"You\u0027re not like us. But you\u0027re not like them, either.\"\n I felt a flare of rage so intense it was almost divine. I hauled off and hit him, an insane thing to do. It was like hitting a Brink\u0027s armored truck. In a flash, he had me off the car and pinned to him, my arms bound to my sides by one of his arms.\n \"No!\" I screamed. I kicked and fought, but I might as well have saved the energy. Finally I sagged against him.\n My breathing was ragged, and so was his. But I didn\u0027t think it was for the same reason.\n \"Why did you think I needed to know about Dawn?\" He sounded so reasonable, you\u0027d think the struggle hadn\u0027t happened.\n \"Well, Mr. Lord of Darkness,\" I said furiously, \"Maudette had old bite marks on her thighs, and the police told Sam that Dawn had bite marks, too.\"\n If silence can be characterized, his was thoughtful. While he was mulling, or whatever vampires do, his embrace loosened. One hand began rubbing my back absently, as if I was a puppy who had whimpered.\n \"You imply they didn\u0027t die from these bites.\"\n \"No. From strangulation.\"\n \"Not a vampire, then.\" His tone put it beyond question.\n \"Why not?\"\n \"If a vampire had been feeding from these women, they would have been drained instead of strangled. They wouldn\u0027t have been wasted like that.\"\n Just when I was beginning to be comfortable with Bill, he\u0027d say something so cold, so vampirey, I had to start all over again.\n \"Then,\" I said wearily, \"either you have a crafty vampire with great self-control, or you have someone who\u0027s determined to kill women who\u0027ve been with vampires.\"\n \"Hmmm.\"\n I didn\u0027t feel very good about either of those choices.\n \"Do you think I\u0027d do that?\" he asked.\n The question was unexpected. I wriggled in his pinioning embrace to look up at him.\n \"You\u0027ve taken great care to point out how heartless you are,\" I reminded him. \"What do you really want me to believe?\"\n And it was so wonderful not to know. I almost smiled.\n \"I could have killed them, but I wouldn\u0027t do it here, or now,\" Bill said. He had no color in the moonlight except for the dark pools of his eyes and the dark arches of his brows. \"This is where I want to stay. I want a home.\"\n A vampire, yearning for home.\n Bill read my face. \"Don\u0027t pity me, Sookie. That would be a mistake.\" He seemed willing me to stare into his eyes.\n \"Bill, you can\u0027t glamor me, or whatever you do. You can\u0027t enchant me into pulling my T-shirt down for you to bite me, you can\u0027t convince me you weren\u0027t ever here, you can\u0027t do any of your usual stuff. You have to be regular with me, or just force me.\"\n \"No,\" he said, his mouth almost on mine. \"I won\u0027t force you.\"\n I fought the urge to kiss him. But at least I knew it was my very own urge, not a manufactured one.\n \"So, if it wasn\u0027t you,\" I said, struggling to keep on course, \"then Maudette and Dawn knew another vampire. Maudette went to the vampire bar in Shreveport. Maybe Dawn did, too. Will you take me there?\"\n \"Why?\" he asked, sounding no more than curious.\n I just couldn\u0027t explain being in danger to someone who was so used to being beyond it. At least at night. \"I\u0027m not sure Andy Bellefleur will go to the trouble,\" I lied.\n \"There are still Bellefleurs here,\" he said, and there was something different in his voice. His arms hardened around me to the point of pain.\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"Lots of them. Andy is a police detective. His sister, Portia, is a lawyer. His cousin Terry is a veteran and a bartender. He substitutes for Sam. There are lots of others.\"\n \"Bellefleur...\"\n I was getting crushed.\n \"Bill,\" I said, my voice squeaky with panic.\n He loosened his grip immediately. \"Excuse me,\" he said formally.\n \"I have to go to bed,\" I said. \"I\u0027m really tired, Bill.\"\n He set me down on the gravel with scarcely a bump. He looked down at me.\n \"You told those other vampires that I belonged to you,\" I said.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"What exactly did that mean?\"\n \"That means that if they try to feed on you, I\u0027ll kill them,\" he said. \"It means you are my human.\"\n \"I have to say I\u0027m glad you did that, but I\u0027m not really sure what being your human entails,\" I said cautiously. \"And I don\u0027t recall being asked if that was okay with me.\"\n \"Whatever it is, it\u0027s probably better than partying with Malcolm, Liam, and Diane.\"\n He wasn\u0027t going to answer me directly.\n \"Are you going to take me to the bar?\"\n \"What\u0027s your next night off?\"\n \"Two nights from now.\"\n \"Then, at sunset. I\u0027ll drive.\"\n \"You have a car?\"\n \"How do you think I get places?\" There might have been a smile on his shining face. He turned to melt into the woods. Over his shoulder he said, \"Sookie. Do me proud.\"\n I was left standing with my mouth open.\n Do him proud indeed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-until-dark-sookie-stackhouse-1/page-3.html","bookId":2191,"book":{"id":2191,"title":"Dead Until Dark (Sookie Stackhouse #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Dead Until Dark (Sookie Stackhouse #1) \n Sookie Stackhouse is just a small-time cocktail waitress in small-town Louisiana.
