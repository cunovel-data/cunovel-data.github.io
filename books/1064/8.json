{"id":9776,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII","content":"At one o\u0027clock on the following day La Grille was in rehearsal, for the first time, in the green-room of the theatre. A dismal light spread like a pall over the grey stones of the roof, the galleries, and the columns. In the depressing majesty of this pallid architecture, beneath the statue of Racine, the leading actors were reading before Pradel, the manager of the house, their parts, which they did not yet know. Romilly, the stage manager, and Constantine Marc, the author of the piece, were all three seated on a red velvet sofa, while, from a bench set back between two columns, was exhaled the vigilant hatred and whispered jealousy of the actresses left out of the cast. The lover, Paul Delage, was with difficulty deciphering a speech: \"\u0027I recognize the chateau with its brick walls, its slated roof; the park, where I have so often entwined her initials and mine on the bark of the trees; the pond whose slumbering waters....\u0027\" Fagette rebuked him: [Pg 98] \"\u0027Beware, Aimeri, lest the chateau know you not again, lest the park forget your name, lest the pond murmur: \"Who is this stranger?\"\u0027\" But she had a cold, and was reading from a manuscript copy full of mistakes. \"Don\u0027t stand there, Fagette: it\u0027s the summer-house,\" said Romilly. \"How do you expect me to know that?\" \"There\u0027s a chair put there.\" \"\u0027Lest the pond murmur: \"Who is this stranger?\"\u0027\" \"Mademoiselle Nanteuil, it\u0027s your cue——Where has Nanteuil got to? Nanteuil!\" Nanteuil came forward muffled up in her furs, her little bag and her part in her hand, white as a sheet, her eyes sunken, her legs nerveless. When fully awake she had seen the dead man enter her bedroom. She inquired: \"Where do I make my entrance from?\" \"From the right.\" \"All right.\" And she read: \"\u0027Cousin, I was so happy when I awoke this morning, I do not know why it was. Can you perhaps tell me?\u0027\" Delage read his reply: [Pg 99] \"\u0027It may be, Cécile, that it was due to a special dispensation of Providence or of fate. The God who loves you suffers you to smile, in the hour of weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\u0027\" \"Nanteuil, my darling, you cross the stage,\" said Romilly. \"Delage, stand aside a bit to let her pass.\" Nanteuil crossed over. \"\u0027Terrible days, do you say, Aimeri? Our days are what we make them. They are terrible for evil-doers only.\u0027\" Romilly interrupted: \"Delage, efface yourself a trifle; be careful not to hide her from the audience. Once more, Nanteuil.\" Nanteuil repeated: \"\u0027Terrible days, do you say, Aimeri? Our days are what we make them. They are terrible for evil-doers only.\u0027\" Constantin Marc no longer recognized his handiwork, he could no longer even hear the sound of his beloved phrases, which he had so often repeated to himself in the Vivarais woods. Dumbfounded and dazed, he held his peace. Nanteuil tripped daintily across the stage, and resumed reading her part: \"\u0027You will perhaps think me very foolish, Aimeri; in the convent where I was brought up, I often used to envy the fate of the victims.\u0027\" [Pg 100] Delage took up his cue, but he had overlooked a page of the manuscript: \"\u0027The weather is magnificent. Already the guests are strolling about the garden.\u0027\" It became necessary to start all over again. \"\u0027Terrible days, do you say, Aimeri....\u0027\" And so they proceeded, without troubling to understand, but careful to regulate their movements, as if studying the figures of a dance. \"In the interests of the play, we shall have to make some cuts,\" said Pradel to the dismayed author. And Delage continued: \"\u0027Do not blame me, Cécile: I felt for you a friendship dating from childhood, one of those fraternal friendships which impart to the love which springs from them a disquieting appearance of incest.\u0027\" \"Incest,\" shouted Pradel. \"You cannot let the word \u0027incest\u0027 remain, Monsieur Constantin Marc. The public has susceptibilities of which you have no idea. Moreover, the order of the two speeches which follow must be transposed. The optics of the stage require it.\" The rehearsal was interrupted. Romilly caught sight of Durville who, in a recess, was telling racy stories. \"Durville, you can go. The second act will not be rehearsed to-day.\" [Pg 101] Before leaving, the old actor went up to Nanteuil, to press her hand. Judging that this was the moment to assure her of his sympathy, he summoned up the tears to his eyes, as anyone condoling with her would have done in his place. But he did it admirably. The pupils of his eyes swam in their orbits, like the moon amid clouds. The corners of his lips were turned down in two deep furrows which prolonged them to the bottom of his chin. He appeared to be genuinely afflicted. \"My poor darling,\" he sighed, \"I pity you, I do indeed! To see one for whom one has experienced a—feeling—with whom one has—lived in intimacy—to see him carried off at a blow—a tragic blow—is hard, is terrible!\" And he extended his compassionate hands. Nanteuil, completely unnerved, and crushing her tiny handkerchief and her part in her hands, turned her back upon him, and hissed between her teeth: \"Old idiot!\" Fagette passed her arm round her waist, and led her gently aside to the foot of Racine\u0027s statue, where she whispered into her ear: \"Listen to me, my dear. This affair must be completely hushed up. Everybody is talking about it. If you let people talk, they will brand you for life as Chevalier\u0027s widow.\" Then, being something of a talker, she added: [Pg 102] \"I know you, I am your best friend. I know your value. But beware, Félicie: women are held at their own valuation.\" Every one of Fagette\u0027s shafts told. Nanteuil, with fiery cheeks, held back her tears. Too young to possess or even to desire the prudence which comes to celebrated actresses when of an age to graduate as women of the world of fashion, she was full of self-esteem, and since she had known what it was to love another she was eager to efface everything unfashionable from her past; she felt that Chevalier, in killing himself for her sake, had behaved towards her publicly with a familiarity which made her ridiculous. Still unaware that all things fall into oblivion, and are lost in the swift current of our days, that all our actions flow like the waters of a river, between banks that have no memory, she pondered, irritated and dejected, at the feet of Jean Racine, who understood her grief. \"Just look at her,\" said Madame Marie-Claire to young Delage. \"She wants to cry. I understand her. A man killed himself for me. I was greatly upset by it. He was a count.\" \"Well, begin again!\" shouted Pradel. \"Come now, Mademoiselle Nanteuil, your cue!\" Whereupon Nanteuil: \"\u0027Cousin, I was so happy when I awoke this morning....\u0027\" [Pg 103] Suddenly, Madame Doulce appeared. Ponderous and mournful, she let fall the following words: \"I have very sad news. The parish priest will not allow him to enter his church.\" As Chevalier had no relations left other than a sister, a working-woman at Pantin, Madame Doulce had undertaken to make arrangements for the funeral at the expense of the members of the company. They gathered round her. She continued: \"The Church rejects him as though he were accurst! That\u0027s dreadful!\" \"Why?\" asked Romilly. Madame Doulce replied in a very low tone and as if reluctantly: \"Because he committed suicide.\" \"We must see to this,\" said Pradel. Romilly displayed an eager desire to be of service. \"The curé knows me,\" he said. \"He is a very decent fellow. I\u0027ll just run over to Saint-étienne-du-Mont, and I\u0027d be greatly surprised if——\" Madame Doulce shook her head sadly: \"All is useless.\" \"All the same, we must have a religious service,\" said Romilly, with all the authority of a stage-manager. [Pg 104] \"Quite so,\" said Madame Doulce. Madame Marie-Claire, deeply exercised in her mind, was of opinion that the priests could be compelled to say a Mass. \"Let us keep cool,\" said Pradel, caressing his venerable beard. \"Under Louis VIII the people broke in the doors of Saint-Roch, which had been closed to the coffin of Mademoiselle Raucourt. We live in other times, and under different circumstances. We must have recourse to gentler methods.\" Constantin Marc, seeing to his great regret that his play was abandoned, had likewise approached Madame Doulce; he inquired of her: \"Why should you want Chevalier to be blessed by the Church? Personally, I am a Catholic. With me, it is not a faith, it is a system, and I look upon it as a duty to participate in all the external practices of worship. I am on the side of all authorities. I am for the judge, the soldier, the priest. I cannot therefore be suspected of favouring civil burials. But I hardly understand why you persist in offering the curé of Saint-étienne-du-Mont a dead body which he repudiates. Now why do you want this unfortunate Chevalier to go to church?\" \"Why?\" replied Madame Doulce. \"For the salvation of his soul and because it is more seemly.\" [Pg 105] \"What would be seemly,\" replied Constantin Marc, \"would be to obey the laws of the Church, which excommunicates suicides.\" \"Monsieur Constantin Marc, have you read Les Soirées de Neuilly?\" inquired Pradel, who was an ardent collector of old books and a great reader. \"What, you have not read Les Soirées de Neuilly, by Monsieur de Fongeray? You have missed something. It is a curious book, which can still be met with sometimes on the quays. It is adorned by a lithograph of Henry Monnier\u0027s, which is, I don\u0027t know why, a caricature of Stendhal. Fongeray is the pseudonym of two Liberals of the Restoration, Dittmer and Cavé. The work consists of comedies and dramas which cannot be acted; but which contain some most interesting scenes representing manners and customs. You will read in it how, in the reign of Charles X, a vicar of one of the Paris churches, the Abbé Mouchaud, would refuse burial to a pious lady, and would, at all costs, grant it to an atheist. Madame d\u0027Hautefeuille was religious, but she held some national property. At her death, she received the ministrations of a Jansenist priest. For this reason, after her death, the Abbé Mouchaud refused to receive her into the church in which she had passed her life. At the same time, in the same parish, Monsieur Dubourg, a big banker, was good enough to die. In his will he stipulated that he [Pg 106] should be borne straight to the cemetery. \u0027He is a Catholic,\u0027 reflected the Abbé Mouchaud, \u0027he belongs to us.\u0027 Quickly making a parcel of his stole and surplice, he rushed off to the dead man\u0027s house, administered extreme unction, and brought him into his church.\" \"Well,\" replied Constantin Marc, \"that vicar was an excellent politician. Atheists are not formidable enemies of the Church. They do not count as adversaries. They cannot raise a Church against her, and they do not dream of doing so. Atheists have existed at all times among the heads and princes of the Church, and many of them have rendered signal services to the Papacy. On the other hand, whoever does not submit strictly to ecclesiastical discipline and breaks away from tradition upon a single point, whoever sets up a faith against the faith, an opinion, a practices against the accepted opinion and the common practice, is a factor of disorder, a menace of peril, and must be extirpated. This the vicar, Mouchaud, understood. He should have been made a Cardinal.\" Madame Doulce, who had been clever enough not to tell everything in a breath, went on to say: \"I did not allow myself to be discomfited by the opposition of Monsieur le Curé. I begged, I entreated. And his answer was: \u0027We owe respectful obedience to the Ordinary. Go to the [Pg 107] Archbishop\u0027s Palace. I will do as Monseigneur bids me.\u0027 There is nothing left for me but to follow this advice. I\u0027m hurrying off to the Archbishop\u0027s Palace.\" \"Let us get to work,\" said Pradel. Romilly called to Nanteuil: \"Nanteuil! Come, Nanteuil, begin your whole scene over again.\" And Nanteuil said once more: \"\u0027Cousin, I was so happy when I awoke this morning....\u0027\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3030/83798.html","bookId":1064,"book":{"id":1064,"title":"A Mummer\u0027s Tale","description":"简介： Flicie Nanteuil, her hair powdered, with blue on her eyelids, rouge on her cheeks and ears, and white on her neck and shoulders, was holding out her foot to Madame Michon, the dresser, who was fitting on a pair of little black slippers with red heels...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3030","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM"}}
