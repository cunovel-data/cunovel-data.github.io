{"id":9784,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI","content":"After a fortnight\u0027s patience Ligny urged her to resume their former intercourse. The period which she herself had fixed had elapsed. He would not wait any longer. She suffered as much as he did in refusing herself to him. But she dreaded to see the dead man return. She found lame excuses for postponing appointments; at last she confessed that she was afraid. He despised her for displaying so little common sense and courage. He no longer felt that she loved him, and he spoke harshly to her, but he pursued her incessantly with his desire. Bitter days and barren hours followed. As she no longer dared to seek the shelter of a roof in his company, they used to take a cab, and after driving for hours about the outskirts of the city they would alight in some gloomy avenue, wandering far down it under the bitter east wind, walking swiftly, as though chastised by the breath of an unseen wrath. Once, however, the weather was so mild that it filled them with its soft languor. Side by side they [Pg 198] trod the deserted paths of the Bois de Boulogne. The buds, which were beginning to swell on the tips of the slender black branches, dyed the tree-tops violet under the rosy sky. To their left stretched the fields, dotted with clumps of leafless trees, and the houses of Auteuil were visible. Slowly driven coupés, with their elderly passengers, crawled along the road, and the wet-nurses pushed their perambulators. A motor-car broke the silence of the Bois with its humming. \"Do you like those machines?\" asked Félicie. \"I find them convenient, that\u0027s all.\" It was true that he was no chauffeur. He had no taste for any kind of sport; he concerned himself only with women. Pointing to a cab which had just passed them, she exclaimed: \"Robert, did you see?\" \"No.\" \"Jeanne Perrin was in it with a woman.\" And, as he displayed a calm indifference, she added in a reproachful tone: \"You are like Dr. Socrates. Do you think that sort of thing natural?\" The lake slept, bright and serene, within its sombre walls of pines. They took the path to their right, which skirted the bank where the white geese and swans were preening their feathers. At their [Pg 199] approach a flotilla of ducks, like living hulls, their necks curving like prows, set sail toward them. Félicie told them, in a regretful tone, that she had nothing to give them. \"When I was little,\" she went on to say, \"Papa used to take me out on Sundays to feed the animals. It was my reward for having learned my lessons well all the week. Papa used to delight in the country. He was fond of dog, horses, all animals in fact. He was very gentle and very clever. He used to work very hard. But life is difficult for an officer who has no money of his own. It grieved him sorely not to be able to do as the wealthy officers did, and then he didn\u0027t hit it off with Mamma. Papa\u0027s life was not a happy one. He was often wretched. He didn\u0027t talk much; but we two understood one another without speaking. He was very fond of me. Robert, dearest, later on, in the distant future, the very distant future, I shall have a tiny house in the country. And when you come there, my beloved, you will find me in a short skirt, throwing corn to my fowls.\" He asked her what gave her the idea of going on the stage. \"I knew very well that I\u0027d never find a husband, since I had no dowry. And from what I saw of my older girl friends, working at dress-making or in a telegraph office, I was not encouraged to follow in [Pg 200] their steps. When I was quite a little girl I thought it would be nice to be an actress. I had once acted, at my boarding-school, in a little play, on St. Nicholas\u0027 Day. I thought it no end of a lark. The schoolmistress said I didn\u0027t act well, but that was because Mamma owed her for a whole term. From the time I was fifteen I began to think seriously about going on the stage. I entered the Conservatoire, I worked, I worked very hard. It\u0027s a back-breaking trade. But success brings rest.\" Opposite the chalet on the island they found the ferry-boat moored to the landing. Ligny jumped into it, pulling Félicie after him. \"Those tall trees are lovely, even without leaves,\" she said. \"But I thought the chalet was closed at this time of the year.\" The ferryman told them that, on fine winter days, people out for a walk liked to visit the island, because they could enjoy quiet there, and that he had only just ferried a couple of ladies across. A waiter, who was living amid the solitude of the island, brought them tea, in a rustic sitting-room, furnished with a couple of chairs, a table, a piano, and a sofa. The panelling was mildewed, the planks of the flooring had started. Félicie looked out of the window at the lawn and the tall trees. [Pg 201] \"What is that,\" she asked, \"that big dark ball on the poplar?\" \"That\u0027s mistletoe, my pet.\" \"One would think it was an animal rolled round the branch, gnawing at it. It isn\u0027t nice to look at.\" She rested her head on her lover\u0027s shoulder, saying in a languid tone: \"I love you.\" He drew her down upon the sofa. She felt him, kneeling at her feet, his hands, clumsy with impatience, gliding over her, and she suffered his attempts, inert, discouraged, foreseeing that it was useless. Her ears were ringing like a little bell. The ringing ceased, and she heard; on her right, a strange, clear, glacial voice say. \"I forbid you to belong to one another.\" It seemed to her that the voice spoke from above, in the glow of light, but she did not dare to turn her head. It was an unfamiliar voice. Involuntarily and despite herself she tried to remember his voice, and she realized that she had forgotten its sound, and that she could never again remember it. The thought came to her \"Perhaps this is the voice he has now.\" Terrified, she swiftly pushed her skirt over her knees. But she refrained from crying out, and she did not speak of what she had just heard, lest she should be taken for a madwoman, and because she realized somehow that it was not real. [Pg 202] Ligny drew away from her. \"If you don\u0027t want anything more to do with me, say so honestly. I am not going to take you by force.\" Sitting upright, with her knees pressed together, she told him: \"Whenever we are in a crowd, as long as there are people about us, I want you, I long for you, but as soon as we are by ourselves I am afraid.\" He replied by a cheap, spiteful sneer: \"Ah, if you must have a public to stimulate you!\" She rose, and returned to the window. A tear was running down her cheek. She wept for some time in silence. Suddenly she called to him: \"Look there!\" She pointed to Jeanne Perrin, who was strolling on the lawn with a young woman. Each had an arm about the other\u0027s waist; they were giving one another violets to smell, and were smiling. \"See! That woman is happy; her mind at peace.\" And Jeanne Perrin, tasting the peace of long-established habits, strolled along satisfied and serene, without even betraying any pride in her strange preference. Félicie watched her with, an interest which she did not confess to herself, and envied her her serenity. [Pg 203] \"She\u0027s not afraid, that woman.\" \"Let her be! What harm is she doing us?\" And he caught her violently by the waist. She freed herself with a shudder. In the end, disappointed, frustrated, humiliated, he lost his temper, called her a silly fool, and swore that he would not stand her ridiculous way of treating him any longer. She made no reply, and once more she began to weep. Angered by her tears, he told her harshly: \"Since you can no longer give me what I ask you, it is useless for us to meet any more. There is nothing more to be said between us. Besides, I see that you have ceased to love me. And you would admit, if for once you could speak the truth, that you have never loved anyone except that wretched second-rate actor.\" Then her anger exploded, and she moaned in despair: \"Liar! Liar! That\u0027s an abominable thing to say. You see I\u0027m crying, and you want to make me suffer more. You take advantage of the fact that I love you to make me miserable. It\u0027s cowardly. Well, no then, I don\u0027t love you any longer. Go away! I don\u0027t want to see you again. Go! But it\u0027s true—what are we doing like this? Are we going to spend our lives staring at each other [Pg 204] like this, wild with each other, full of despair and rage? It is not my fault—I can\u0027t, I can\u0027t. Forgive me, darling, I love you, I worship you, I want you. Only drive him away. You are a man, you know what there is to do. Drive him away. You killed him, not I. It was you. Kill him altogether then—Oh God, I am going mad. I am going mad!\" On the following day, Ligny applied to be sent as Third Secretary to The Hague. He was appointed a week later, and left at once, without having seen Félicie again.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3030/83806.html","bookId":1064,"book":{"id":1064,"title":"A Mummer\u0027s Tale","description":"简介： Flicie Nanteuil, her hair powdered, with blue on her eyelids, rouge on her cheeks and ears, and white on her neck and shoulders, was holding out her foot to Madame Michon, the dresser, who was fitting on a pair of little black slippers with red heels...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3030","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM"}}
