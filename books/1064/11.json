{"id":9779,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI","content":"Having said her prayer, Nanteuil, without waiting to hear Pradel\u0027s speech, jumped into a carriage in order to join Robert de Ligny, who was waiting for her in front of the Montparnasse railway station. Amid the throng of passers-by they shook hands, gazing at one another without a word. More than ever did they feel that they were bound together. Robert loved her. He loved her without knowing it. She was for him, or so he believed, merely one delight in the infinite series of possible delights. But delight had assumed for him the form of Félicie, and, had he reflected more deeply upon the innumerable women whom he promised himself in the vast remainder of his newly begun life, he would have recognized that now they were all Félicies. He might at least have realized that, without having any intention of being faithful to her, he did not dream of being unfaithful, and that since she had given herself to him he had not desired any other woman. But he did not realize it. [Pg 167] On this occasion, however, standing in the bustling commonplace square, on seeing her no longer in the voluptuous shadow of night, nor under the caressing glimmer of the alcove which gave her naked form the delicious vagueness of a Milky Way, but in a harsh, diffused daylight, by the circumstantial illumination of a sunlight devoid of splendour and without shadows, which revealed beneath her veil her eyelids that were seared with tears, her pearly cheeks and roughened lips, he realized that he felt for this woman\u0027s flesh a profound and mysterious inclination. He did not question her. They exchanged only tender trivial phrases. And, as she was very hungry, he took her to lunch at a well-known cabaret whose name shone in letters of gold on one of the old houses in the square. They had their meal served in the winter-garden, whose rockery, fountain, and solitary tree were multiplied by mirrors framed in a green trellis. When seated at the table, consulting the bill of fare, they conversed with less restraint than heretofore. He told her that the emotions and worries of the past three days had unstrung his nerves, but he no longer thought about it, and it would be absurd to worry about the matter any further. She spoke to him of her health, complaining that she could not sleep, save for a restless slumber full of dreams. But she did not tell him what she saw [Pg 168] in those dreams, and she avoided speaking of the dead man. He asked her if she had not spent a tiring morning, and why she had gone to the cemetery, a useless proceeding. Incapable of explaining to him the depths of her soul, submissive to rites and propitiatory ceremonies and incantations, she shook her head as if to say: \"Had to.\" While those lunching at the adjoining tables were finishing their meal, they talked for a long time, both in subdued tones, while waiting to be served. Robert had promised himself, had sworn indeed never to reproach Félicie for having had Chevalier for her lover, or even to ask her a single question in this connection. And yet, moved by some obscure resentment, by an ebullition of ill-temper or natural curiosity, and also because he loved her too deeply to control himself, he said to her, with bitterness in his voice: \"You were on intimate terms with him, formerly.\" She was silent, and did not deny the fact. Not that she felt that it was henceforth useless to lie. On the contrary, she was in the habit of denying the obvious truth, and she had, of course, too much knowledge of men to be ignorant of the fact that, when in love, there is no lie, however clumsy, [Pg 169] which they cannot believe if they wish to do so. But on this occasion, contrary to her nature and habit, she refrained from lying. She was afraid of offending the dead. She imagined that in denying him she would be doing him a wrong, depriving him of his share, angering him. She held her peace, fearing to see him come and rest his elbows on the table, with his fixed smile and the hole in his head, and to hear him say in his plaintive voice. \"Félicie, you surely cannot have forgotten our little room, in the Rue des Martyrs?\" What he had become, for her, since his death, she could not have said, so alien was it to her beliefs, so contrary to her reason, and so antiquated, ridiculous and obsolete did the words which would have expressed her feeling seem to her. But from some remote inherited instinct, or more likely from certain tales which she had heard in her childhood, she derived a confused idea that he was of the number of those dead who in the days of old were wont to torment the living, and were exorcised by the priests; for upon thinking of him she instinctively began to make the sign of the cross, and she checked herself only that she might not seem ridiculous. Ligny, seeing her melancholy and distracted, blamed himself for his harsh and useless words, while at the very moment of reproaching himself [Pg 170] for them he followed them by others equally harsh and equally useless. \"And yet you told me it was not true!\" She replied, fervently: \"Because, don\u0027t you see, I wanted it not to be true.\" She added: \"Oh, my darling, since I\u0027ve been yours, I swear to you that I\u0027ve not belonged to anyone else. I don\u0027t claim any merit for this; I should have found it impossible.\" Like the young of animals, she had need of gaiety. The wine, which shone in her glass like liquid amber, was a joy to her eyes, and she moistened her tongue with it with luxurious pleasure. She took an interest in the dishes set before her, and especially in the pommes de terre soufflées, like golden blisters. Next she watched the people lunching at the tables in the dining-room, attributing to them, according to their appearance, ridiculous opinions or grotesque passions. She noticed the ill-natured glances which the women directed toward her, and the efforts of the men to appear handsome and important. And she gave utterance to a general reflection: \"Robert, have you noticed that people are never natural? They do not say a thing because they think it. They say it because they think it is what [Pg 171] they ought to say. This habit makes them very wearisome. And it is extremely rare to find anyone who is natural. You, you are natural.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m guilty of posing.\" \"You pose like the rest. But you pose in your own character. I can see perfectly well when you are trying to surprise and impress me.\" She spoke to him of himself and, led back by an involuntary train of thought to the tragedy enacted at Neuilly, she inquired: \"Did your mother say anything to you?\" \"No.\" \"Yet she must have known.\" \"It is probable.\" \"Are you on good terms with her?\" \"Why, yes!\" \"They say she is still very beautiful, your mother, is it so?\" He did not answer her and sought to change the conversation. He did not like Félicie to speak to him of his mother, or to turn her attention to his family. Monsieur and Madame de Ligny enjoyed the highest consideration in Parisian society. Monsieur de Ligny, a diplomatist by birth and by profession, was in himself a person worthy of the greatest consideration. He was so even before his birth, by virtue of the diplomatic services which his ancestors had rendered to France. His great-grandfather [Pg 172] had signed the surrender of Pondicherry to England. Madame de Ligny lived with her husband on the most correct terms. But, although she had no money of her own, she lived in great style, and her gowns were one of the greatest glories of France. She received intimate visits from an ex-Ambassador. His age, his position, his opinions, his titles, and his great fortune made the connection respectable. Madame de Ligny kept the ladies of the Republic at arm\u0027s length, and, when the spirit moved her, gave them lessons in decorum. She had nothing to fear from the opinion of the fashionable world. Robert knew that she was looked upon with respect by people in society. But he was continually dreading that, in speaking of her, Félicie might fail to do so with all the needful reserve. He feared lest, not being in society, she might say that which had better have been left unsaid. He was wrong; Félicie knew nothing of the private life of Madame de Ligny; moreover, had she known of it, she would not have blamed her. The lady inspired her with a naive curiosity and an admiration mingled with fear. Since her lover was unwilling to speak to her of his mother, she attributed his reserve to a certain aristocratic arrogance, even to a lack of consideration, for her, at which the pride of the freewoman and the plebeian was up in arms. She was wont to say to him tartly: [Pg 173] \"I\u0027m perfectly free to speak of your mother.\" The first time she had added: \"Mine is just as good as yours.\" But she had realized that the remark was vulgar, and she had not repeated it. The dining-room was now empty. She looked at her watch, and saw that it was three o\u0027clock. \"I must be off,\" she said. \"La Grille is being rehearsed this afternoon. Constantin Marc ought to be at the theatre already. There\u0027s another queer fellow for you! He boasts that when he\u0027s in the Vivarais he ruins all the women. And yet he is so shy that he daren\u0027t even talk to Fagette and Falempin. I frighten him. It amuses me.\" She was so tired that she had not the courage to rise. \"Isn\u0027t it queer? They are saying everywhere that I\u0027m engaged for the Fran?ais, it\u0027s not true. There\u0027s not even a question of it. Of course, I can\u0027t remain indefinitely where I am. In the long run one would get besotted there. But there is no hurry. I have a great part to create in La Grille. We shall see after that. What I want is to play comedy. I don\u0027t want to join the Fran?ais and then to do nothing.\" Suddenly, gazing in front of her with eyes full of terror, she flung herself backwards, turned pale, and uttered a shrill scream. Then her eyelids fluttered, and she murmured that she could not breathe. [Pg 174] Robert loosened her jacket, and moistened her temples with a little water. She spoke. \"A priest! I saw a priest. He was in his surplice. His lips were moving, but no sound came from them. He looked at me.\" He tried to comfort her. \"Come now, my darling, how can you suppose that a priest, a priest in his surplice, would show himself in a restaurant?\" She listened obediently, and allowed herself to be persuaded. \"You are right, you are right, I know it well enough.\" In that little head of hers illusions were soon dispelled. She was born two hundred and thirty years after the death of Descartes, of whom she had never heard; yet, as Dr. Socrates would have said, he had taught her the use of reason. Robert met her at six o\u0027clock after the rehearsal, under the arcades of the Odéon, and drove away with her in a cab. \"Where are we going?\" she inquired. He hesitated a little. \"You would not care to go back to our house out there?\" She cried out at the suggestion. \"Oh no! I couldn\u0027t! Oh, heavens, never!\" He replied that he had thought as much; that he would try to find something else: a little ground-floor flat in Paris; that in the meantime, just for to-day, they would content themselves with a chance abode. She gazed at him with fixed, heavy eyes, drew him violently towards her, scorching his neck and ear with the breath of her desire. Then her arms fell away from him, and she sank back beside him, dejected and relaxed. When the cab stopped, she said: \"You will not be vexed with me, will you, my own Robert, at what I am going to say? Not to-day—to-morrow.\" She had considered it necessary to make this sacrifice to the jealous dead.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3030/83801.html","bookId":1064,"book":{"id":1064,"title":"A Mummer\u0027s Tale","description":"简介： Flicie Nanteuil, her hair powdered, with blue on her eyelids, rouge on her cheeks and ears, and white on her neck and shoulders, was holding out her foot to Madame Michon, the dresser, who was fitting on a pair of little black slippers with red heels...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3030","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM"}}
