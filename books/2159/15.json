{"id":97639,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Wrapped in a plain, darkpiwafwi,the cowl drawn over her head, Quenthel tramped south across the city. The experience was strange, unique in her personal experience. She was on foot, not mounted on a lizard or enthroned on a floating stone disk. She was alone, not accompanied by a column of guards and servants, and most strangely of all, no one paid her any real attention. Oh, slaves scurried out of her path, and males offered her a cursory show of respect, but no one feared her or cringed in awe of her. Indeed, she herself had to offer obeisance to the noble females she encountered along the way, lest their soldiers chastise her for insolence.\n It was galling, unsettling, and somehow tempting as well. In her most private thoughts, she\u0027d imagined herself simply running away from the implacable foe who worked so assiduously to kill her. It might be the only way she could survive. If she opted to flee this minute, she was already off to a good start. She\u0027d managed to slip away from Tier Breche with no one, she hoped, the wiser.\n Flight was a cowardly notion, though, unworthy of a Baenre, and it angered her when she entertained it even for a moment. Until the attacks began, she never had before. She turned a corner, and Qu\u0027ellarz\u0027orl, came into view. Her destination was nigh, and she focused her thoughts on the task at hand.\n Sneaking away from the Academy had been a little complicated. First, she\u0027d had to surreptitiously lay hands on nondescript outerwear that would allow her to pass for a commoner. Such apiwafwi certainly hadn\u0027t existed among her own garments, all of which were costly and bejeweled, but she\u0027d found it among the effects of one of the kitchen staff. After disposing of the cook lest the missing garment be reported, she had to exit Arach-Tinilith without anyone realizing it was her, including her own watchful sentries. Finally, she needed to skulk to the edge of the plateau andfloat down to the cavern floor below\n without the guards at the top of the staircase noticing.\n She\u0027d managed it, though, and she was confident of her ability to sneak back into the Academy, even after the plateau had been put on a state of heightened security.\n A road ran up the eminence that was Qu\u0027ellarz\u0027orl to the castles of Menzoberranzan\u0027s greatest families. It wasn\u0027t off limits to commoners. Merchants and supplicants used it all the time, but they were subject to search and interrogation by House Baenre patrols.\n Quenthel started up the twisting road and made it better than halfway to the top before she heard the distinctive grunt and hiss of a riding lizard. She scurried off the path into the forest of giant, phosphorescent mushrooms, where she crouched behind a particularly massive specimen.\n The patrol, a mounted officer and a dozen foot soldiers, marched by without so much as glancingher way. Hiding from her own troops was another bizarre, almost surreal experience.\n When the warriors passed, she hurried on up the slope. In another minute, she reached the top of the rise. Before her rose the most opulent fortresses in the city. At the easternmost end of the expanse, House Baenre towered on the highest ground of all, dwarfing every other structure.\n She turned her steps toward the tall, slender spire known as Spelltower Xorlarrin, residence of the Fifth House. Bands of shimmering faerie fire striped the iron walls.\n She climbed the steep steps to the gate under the watchful eyes of the sentries on the battlements. Had she not already known it, their vigilance would have shown that she could maintain complete anonymity no longer.\n Still, she\u0027d do the best she could.\n When a sentry armed with spear and long sword strode over to ask her business, she said, \"I\u0027m going to show you something remarkable. Don\u0027t let your amazement show.\"\n He looked skeptical. He lived in the Spelltower, after all, and had seen his share of marvels.\n \"All fight, ma\u0027am. Show me, if you will.\"\n She twitched open herpiwafwi, giving him a glimpse of the Baenre House insignia hanging at her throat.\n His eyes widened, but otherwise, he did a fair job of doing as she\u0027d bade him.\n \"How may I serve you?\" he asked softly, the slightest quaver in his voice.\n \"I want to enter the tower without anyone paying the least attention to me, and I want to talk to your matron alone.\"\n \"Please, come with me.\"\n The guard led her through the gate and into a confusion of service passages such as every castle possessed. The corridors eventually brought them into a nicely appointed room with comfortable-looking sandstone chairs, a carnelian-and-obsidiansava set awaiting a pair of players, and frescos of some of Lolth\u0027s attendant demons adorning the walls.\n Her escort departed in search of his mistress, leaving Quenthel to prowl restlessly about the room. Finally the door opened, and Zeerith Q\u0027Xorlarrin slipped through. Her features were plain and nondescript, but she was notable for a dignified bearing and composure that rarely failed her even in the most extreme situations. For a matron, her costume was rather plain and austere.\n The two princesses saluted one another, then Zeerith ushered her guest to a seat.\n \"When Antatlab told me you\u0027d come without a single guard, I wondered if he\u0027d gone mad,\" the matron remarked.\n \"Can I trust him not to gossip about my visit?\"\n \"He\u0027s discreet enough. Now, may I ask why I\u0027m so unexpectedly enjoying the honor of your company?\"\n Quenthel related the events of the past three nights.\n \"If I still possessed my magic,\" she concluded. \"I could deal with this matter easily, but as things stand ... I need help.\"\n The words galled her, but they had to be said.\n \"Why have you sought it here?\" Zeerith asked.\n \"The Xorlarrins have always supported the Baenre and profited thereby. Try as I might, I can\u0027t think of a compelling reason you\u0027d want me dead, and your House boasts many of the best wizards in Menzoberranzan. So, if I must trust someone, you\u0027re a good chance. Will you aid me, Matron?\"\n Zeerith took her time replying. Quenthel knew the other female was cold-bloodedly pondering whether to help, deny, or betray her. Where did the greatest advantage lie?\n \"Your plight is an outrage,\" the Xorlarrin said at last, \"an affront to all priestesses. Of course I\u0027ll aid you. For ten thousand talents of gold, and your support when my clan\u0027s dispute with House Agrach Dyrr becomes publicknowledge.\"\n \"What dispute?\"\n \"The one I\u0027ll be stirring up in a tenday or two. Do we have a bargain?\"\n Quenthel\u0027s mouth tightened. If she\u0027d come to the Spelltower in the full panoply of a Baenre princess, Zeerith would have thought twice about making conditions, but by arriving incognito the mistress had shown her desperation and in so doing, shifted the transaction to another level.\n \"Yes,\" she growled, \"I agree.\"\n \"I thank you for your generosity. What do you require?\"\n \"Every night,\" said Quenthel, \"a new demon comes to kill me, and I fend it off as best I can. If this goes on, a night will come when the entity kills me instead. I need to do more. I need to end the siege, and it\u0027s my hope your mages know a way. I confess I don\u0027t. I\u0027ve ransacked every vault, chest, and drawer in Arach-Tinilith and found nothing that will serve.\"\n \"So that\u0027s why you came in secret. You want a weapon, and you don\u0027t want your foe to know about it. Otherwise, he might take counter-measures.\"\n \"Correct.\"\n Zeerith rose. \"We\u0027ll ask Horroodissomoth. He can do it if anyone can, and he\u0027ll keep his mouth shut after.\"\n She opened the door and directed Antatlab, who\u0027d been standing watch outside, to go and fetch her patron and House wizard.\n Horroodissomoth arrived shortly thereafter. Quenthel felt a little twinge of disgust, for the mage was the antithesis of the typical vital dark elf male. His features were lined and wrinkled, and his posture, bent. Rumor had it that his appearance of decrepitude had resulted not from extreme age but rather some dangerous magical experimentation.\n Moving stiffly, all but creaking audibly, Horroodissomoth tendered obeisance then, at Zeerith\u0027s invitation, settled in a chair to listen to a reprise of Quenthel\u0027s story. At first the wizard\u0027s demeanor was impassive, perhaps even utterly disinterested, but a light came into his rheumy eyes when he realized she was asking him to solve a magical problem.\n \"Hmm,\" he said, \"hmm. I think I might have something that will help. In a way, I regret giving it to you, because as far as I know, it\u0027s unique. Even we Xorlarrins don\u0027t know how to make another. But on the other hand, I\u0027ve always been curious to see if it actually works.\"\n Gossip whispered that at some point in the distant past, the females of House Ousstyl had interbred with humans. Naturally the contemporary Ousstyls denied it and would do their meager best to punish anyone they suspected of passing the rumor. Still, as Faeryl gazed across the table at Talindra Ousstyl, Matron Mother of the Fifty-second House, she could readily believe it. Talindra was tall and, for a dark elf, extraordinarily rawboned. Her jaw was too square, and her ears, insufficiently pointed. Most telling of all was the scatter of empty plates before her. She\u0027d annihilated every morsel of her seven-course supper with a lesser beings insatiable voracity.\n Talindra finished with a juicy belch.\n \"Excuse me.\"\n \"Of course,\" Faeryl said. She thought she heard a thump issuing from elsewhere in the ambassadorial residence. Inwardly, she flinched but Talindra didn\u0027t seem to notice the sound.\n \"Well,\" the matron said, \"that was tasty, but I believe you invited my brood to supper and spirited me away to this private room, because you wanted to talk of something more important than cuisine.\"\n Faeryl smiled and said, \"You\u0027ve found me out, and I have a confession to make, I don\u0027t always devote myself to the interests of Ched Nasad as a whole. Occasionally I work solely to advance the fortunes of House Zauvirr\n If the matron had the capacity to throw a spell, that changed the complexion of the fight considerably. Faeryl needed to end it quickly, perhaps before the first magical effect manifested. She charged her opponent, striking at her head in an all-out attack.\n It was a reckless move, and she suffered the consequences. The knife point jabbed painfully into her ribs. Luckily, it failed to penetrate the mail she wore beneath her silken gown. Mother\u0027s Kiss slammed into the Menzoberranyr\u0027s head and dashed her to the ground. Her hand slipped away from the amulet, and the glow faded.\n An instant later, a second guard burst into the room.\n \"We\u0027ve secured them all, my lady.\"\n The warrior was a rugged-looking male with a chipped incisor and a broken nose, whom she had on occasion summoned to her bed.\n \"Good,\" Faeryl replied. \"How many did you have to kill?\"\n \"Only one, but we could slaughter the rest. If I may say so, it seems more sensible and less bother than tying them up.\"\n \"It does, but I came here to promote good relations between Menzoberranzan and Ched Nasad. Even though some schemer has rendered my efforts futile, I won\u0027t exacerbate the situation by committing any more outrages than necessary. You soldiers will do as I bade you. Strip the Ousstyls, gag them, and tie them up.\"\n Talindra groaned and groped feebly for her knife. Impressed that the matron was still conscious to any degree at all after the blow she\u0027d suffered, Faeryl kicked the blade out of her reach.\n \"You can\u0027t do this,\" Talindra croaked, \"not to House Ousstyl. We are mighty and never forget an affront.\"\n Tense as she was, Faeryl smiled. The matron\u0027s arrogance was woefully misplaced. The Ousstyls were so insignificant they hadn\u0027t even known the ambassador had lost the good will of Triel Baenre. Otherwise, they would never have accepted an invitation to feast with such a pariah.\n Faeryl bashed Talindra again, this time rendering her entirely insensible, then she roamed through the castle, exhorting her minions to make haste. Soon all were wearing the clothing of the Ousstyls. For the first time, Faeryl was grateful that her household was relatively small. Otherwise, they wouldn\u0027t have had enough pilfered garments to go around.\n She and her lieutenants sported the finery of the Ousstyl dignitaries, while the common soldiers had donnedpiwafwis and mail, and carried the arms of Talindra\u0027s bodyguards.\n The outlanders stowed provisions beneath their mantles. The quantity was insufficient, for they couldn\u0027t\n conceal all that much. With luck, they\u0027d be able to hunt and forage on the trail. They headed for the mansion\u0027s enclosed stable, where Talindra had left her driftdisc.\n Faeryl noticed that some of her retainers were sweaty and wide-eyed. Though she was careful not to show it, she still felt just as apprehensive herself. Was she mad to flout Triel Baenre\u0027s express command, especially when she and her subordinate priestesses had virtually no magic implements left?\n Well, no. It would be lunacy to sit on her rump and do nothing, knowing that Triel would eventually get around to ordering her arrest. Even if Faeryl weren\u0027t concerned about her own fate, with every passing hour she grew more anxious to learn what had halted all traffic from Ched Nasad, and not just because the trade was important in its own right. Absurd as it seemed, she couldn\u0027t shake the irrational fear that some misfortune had befallen the City of Shimmering Webs itself.\n She had to know. Any great event affecting Ched Nasad could conceivably injure House Zauvirr and diminish her own status. Moreover, though she would never admit it to another, she cared about her homeland for its own sake. Not, she assured herself, that she suffered from love, loyalty, or any other soft, un-drowlike emotion. Yet Ched Nasad had shaped her into the person she was. It was a part of her, and anything that harmed the city would trouble her as well.\n In any case, having assaulted and robbed her dinner guests, the die was cast.\n The pack and riding lizards hissed and grunted when the party entered the stable. Faeryl dearly wished she could take some of the reptiles with her, but since Talindra hadn\u0027t brought any such beasts along with her, it was out of the question.\n The matron\u0027s driftdisc was a round, flat stone with an ivory throne fastened on top, the whole floating about a foot above the floor. The device glowed with a soft white light tinged ever so faintly with green.\n Since it was Faeryl who\u0027d appropriated Talindra\u0027s attire, she hopped up on the driftdisc, sat in the ornate cushioned chair, and mentally commanded the apparatus to levitate up to the proper dignified height. She endured a bad moment during which nothing happened, and she was sure the Ousstyl had rigged the vehicle in such a way as to keep anyone else from riding it, then the circular platform rose. It was just sluggish, about what you\u0027d expected of the equipment of the Fifty-second House.\n Two of Faeryl\u0027s soldiers threw open the gates, and the party ventured out into the open, her retainers forming a proper column around her as soon as they had the room.\n They marched away from the luminous keep that had been their home for fourteen years, past the alleyway where Umrae had died, and onward. Faeryl couldn\u0027t see Triel\u0027s watchers, but she could feel their eyes on her. She felt all but certain they would recognize her.\n But maybe not. Most people saw what they expected to see. The spies had watched the Ousstyls enter the residence, and just as anticipated, the petty nobles were departing. Why would anyone bother to peer closely when he was sure he already knew what was going on?\n That was the theory, anyway. At the moment, it seemed a dubious notion on which to gamble her life.\n Her company left the immediate vicinity of the residence without anyone trying to hinder them, which proved nothing. The watchers wouldn\u0027t pop out of hiding and confront the fugitives themselves, They\u0027d scurry away to rouse a company of warriors, who\u0027d intercept the daughters and sons of Ched Nasad in the street.\n Thus, while her expression conveyed the proper mix of serenity and haughtiness, her muscles were stiff, and her mouth dry as she floated down the avenues. For the moment, she was heading for Narbondellyn, site of the Ousstyls\u0027 modest citadel. It was where the spies would expect her to go.\n Drow did their best to clear the way for the matron of even a minor House. She was grateful for that. Still, heavily laden carts and the like could only pull aside so quickly. The impostors\u0027 progress was necessarily and nerve-rackingly sedate.\n Finally, though, they passed Narbondel itself, where the magical glow had climbed three quarters of the way to the top of the great stone column. Faeryl spotted Talindra\u0027s fortress and turned her company aside. If they actually approached the place, some guard peering down from the ramparts was bound to penetrate their disguises.\n They marched south, still without interference. If someone was chasing them, the ambassador was sure it would have become apparent by then. Faeryl took a deep breath, told herself her ruse had succeeded, and tried to relax. She couldn\u0027t, quite. Perhaps when she reached the Bauthwaf, or better still, escaped Menzoberranyr territory altogether . . .\n The outlanders\u0027 route carried them to the west of the elevation that was Qu\u0027ellarz\u0027orl, its slopes thick with enormous mushrooms. Then, at last, they reached one of the city\u0027s hundred gates to the tunnels beyond. The Menzoberranyr defended all of them, but this one at least was a minor exit. It boasted fewer guards than most.\n The fugitives approached boldly, as if they had every legitimate expectation of the sentries ushering them through. The guards must have wondered why a high priestess would wear an elegant cloak and gown and ride her ceremonial transport for an excursion into the dirty, dangerous caves beyond the city, but a matron\u0027s whim was law in Menzoberranzan. They offered her obeisance, then set about the cumbersome process of unbarring the granite-and-adamantine valves - or most of them did.\n One officer eyed Faeryl thoughtfully. He had a foxy, humorousface and was smaller than most males, which apparently didn\u0027t hinder him when wielding the heavy broadsword hanging from his baldric. Though he carried the blade of a warrior, he\u0027d eschewed mail - which could disrupt arcane spells - for a cloak and jerkin possessed of the countless telltale pockets of a wizard. Evidently he was fighter and wizard both. When she gazed directly at him, he respectfully lowered his head but resumed his scrutiny as soon as she turned her head.\n She pivoted around to face him and asked, \"Captain, is it?\"\n The small male gave her a smart salute.\n \"Captain Filifar, my lady, at your service.\"\n \"Please, come here.\"\n Filifar obeyed. If he betrayed any wariness, it was only in his eyes. The two gigantic spiders graven in the leaves of the gate stirred ever so slightly. Faeryl realized they would emerge from the carving and fight for him if commanded.\n \"You have the look of an intelligent male,\" she said, gazing down at him from atop the driftdisc.\n \"Thank you, my lady.\"\n \"Perhaps you received orders,\" she continued, \"to refuse passage to the delegation from Ched Nasad.\"\n \"No, my lady.\"\n Fillfar\u0027s hand twitched ever so slightly. It wanted to reach for either the hilt of his sword or the spell components in one of his pockets.\n \"Your subordinates were content to receive their instructions and let it go at that, but not a sharp boy like you. Somehow you contrived to find out what the ambassador looks like, thus making sure you\u0027d be able to recognize her if she came this way.\"\n Filifar\u0027s mouth tightened. \"My lady,\" he said, \"my company is well armed and well trained. You may also have observed the spiders graven - \"\n She raised her hand. \"Don\u0027t agitate yourself, Captain. I mean you no harm. We\u0027re just two Menzoberranyr idly chatting, passing the time it takes your fellows to open the gate.\"\n \"I regret, my lady, that now that I\u0027ve seen you up close, I can\u0027t allow them to do that.\"\n He took two careful steps back, retreating beyond her reach, then pivoted to shout the order.\n Faeryl stopped him dead by displaying a gaudy ruby brooch, formerly Talindra\u0027s property.\n \"I said you were an intelligent lad, Captain Filifar, but I don\u0027t believe you\u0027re a prosperous one. You wear no jewelry, and your clothing is made of common stuff.\"\n \"You\u0027re right, milady. Fortune hasn\u0027t favored me.\"\n \"It can.\"\n Faeryl brought out one ornament after another, the jewels her retainers had stolen from the Ousstyls and her own legitimate treasure as well. She filled her lap with them and laid the surplus on the pale, luminous rim of the drift-disc.\n \"Here\u0027s enough wealth to improve your luck and that of your minions as well.\"\n Filifar hesitated before saying, \"My lady, I was told that Matron Triel herself wishesyou detained. It\u0027s no light matter to cross the Baenre.\"\n \"Just say the Zauvirr didn\u0027t pass throughthis gate, or if they did, you didn\u0027t recognize them. No one will know any different.\"\n He jerked his head in a nod. \"Right. Why not, curse it?\"\n He removed hispiwafwi to use as a makeshift bag arid swept the jewelry in. Some of the soldiers noticed what their captain was doing and scurried over to investigate.\n Once the gate was well behind her, Faeryl abandoned the driftdisc. The stately conveyance was just too slow. She and her party quick-marched on through the mostly unimproved passages at the fringe of\n Menzoberranyr territory, past hunters\u0027 outposts and adamantine mines, making for the genuine wilderness beyond.\n Faeryl realized she was grinning. It was absurd, really. She\u0027d just surrendered a queen\u0027s ransom in gems, Triel would send troops after her, and she was all but certain some dire peril lay ahead, but somehow, for the moment, none of it mattered. Faeryl had outwitted her foes and finally, after fourteen years, she was going home.\n The fugitives rounded a bend, and dark figures seemed to flow from the tunnel walls just ahead. The Zauvirr turned to run. Somehow, the shadows were behind them as well.\n On the fringe of Menzoberranyr territory, Valas Hune could sense the genuine wilderness beyond. He could feel its vast and labyrinthine spaces and hear its pregnant silences. He could smell and taste its variations of rock and imagined himself simply slipping away into that limitless world.\n As fancies went, his wasn\u0027t entirely absurd. Most dark elves feared to travel the Underdark except in armed convoys, and with good reason. They, however, lacked the abilities he\u0027d spent decades developing, survival skills that made him one of the finest scouts in Menzoberranzan.\n Indeed, the small, wiry male in the rugged outdoorsman\u0027s garb liked traversing the subterranean world alone. He relished the wonders, the quiet, and the freedom. Sometimes, when he\u0027d idled in camp too long, he felt he preferred it to the striving, conniving existence of his fellow drow, the luxuries of Menzoberranzan notwithstanding. He yearned for an errand that would take him out into the wilderness, and played with the notion of simply running away.\n He heard the Zauvirr coming and put the dream aside. Like itor not, his mission this day wasn\u0027t to explore the wild. It was to direct his company, fellow mercenaries of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, in the taking of Faeryl Zauvirr and her retainers.\n That was the theory, anyway. In point of fact, he didn\u0027t have to give any more orders. No doubt the warriors of Ched Nasad were competent fighters in their own right, but when the sellswords swarmed out of hiding, they caught them entirely by surprise, then proceeded to cut them down with murderous efficiency.\n Once Valas was certain his band would be victorious, he started searching for Faeryl herself. His smallness and natural agility enabled him to thread his way through the fury of battle without harm.\n He found the princess at the center of the carnage. She\u0027d just finished killing one of his command. The dead male\u0027s brains and bloody hair adhered to one end of her basalt-headed warhammer.\n \"Ambassador,\" Valas called. \"I have orders to take you alive, if possible.\"\n She answered with a curse. He didn\u0027t blame her for that. In her place, he wouldn\u0027t want to be delivered alive to Matron Baenre, either.\n He hefted one of his matched pair of kukris - vicious curved daggers - and fingered a little brass ovoid, one of many trinkets adorning his tunic and cloak.\n He\u0027d collected the amulets and brooches from races and civilizations across the Underdark. Fashioned according to alien aesthetics, most of the ornaments were ugly and uncouth to dark elf eyes, but he hadn\u0027t acquired them for their appearance, nor were they merely souvenirs. Each contained a different enchantment.\n Three images, exact facsimiles of himself, flickered into existence around him. He edged toward Faeryl, and the phantoms came with him.\n She stared fiercely, obviously trying to pick out the real Valas from the false. It didn\u0027t help. When she swung, she struck at the image on his left.\n The illusion vanished on contact, and at the same instant, he sprang. She couldn\u0027t come back on guard in time to fend him off. He hooked a leg behind her and threw her to the ground, then kicked her repeatedly in the head until she went limp. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dissolution-war-of-the-spider-queen-1/page-15.html","bookId":2159,"book":{"id":2159,"title":"Dissolution (War of the Spider Queen #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Dissolution (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
