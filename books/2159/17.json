{"id":97641,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"All the undercreatures gawked when Pharaun and Ryld strolled into the cellar, and why not? The mage doubted this foul little drinking pit had ever seen such an elegant figure as himself, an aristocrat of graceful carriage, exquisite ornaments, dress, and coiffure . . . well, he hoped that, after some emergency adjustments, his hair was at least passable.\n In any case, it was plain the goblins, orcs, and whatevers had little interest in aesthetic appreciation. They whispered, glowered, and fingered their weapons whenever they thought the two dark elves weren\u0027t looking at them, and the fear and hate in the sweltering, low-ceilinged room were palpable. Pharaun supposed that considering what Greyanna and her hunters had wrought in the Braeryn the previous night, a measure of surliness was, if not good form, at least understandable.\n He wondered how they\u0027d react if they discovered his sister had slaughtered their fellows by the score merely to create an opportunity to kill him. Perhaps if was a question best left in the realm of the hypothetical.\n Knowing that Ryld was watching his back, the Master of Sorcere sauntered to the bar and, with a sweep of his arm, scattered clattering coins across it. The currency was the usual miscellany encountered in Menzoberranzan - rounds, squares, triangles, rings, spiders, and octagons - half of it minted by the dozen or so greatest noble Houses and the rest imported from other lands in the Underdark and even the World Above. It was all silver, platinum, or gold, though, more precious metal than this squalid hole probably saw in a decade.\n \"Tonight,\" Pharaun announced, \"this company of boon companions drinks at my expense!\"\n The taverner, a squat orc with a twisted, oozing mouth and a mangy scalp, stared for a heartbeat or two, scooped up the coins, and began dipping some foul-smelling brew from a filthy tub. Cursing and threatening one another, the rest of the undercreatures shoved forward to get it. The wizard noted that no one thanked him.\n After looking around for another moment, Pharaun spotted another dark elf slouched in a corner, evidently one of the wretches who\u0027d sunk so low the goblinoids accepted him as one of their own.\n \"Come here, my friend,\" the wizard beckoned.\n The outcast flinched. \"Me?\"\n \"Yes. What\u0027s your name?\"\n The fellow hesitated, then said, \"Bruherd, once of House Duskryn.\"\n \"Indeed, until your noble kin kicked you out. We have much in common, Bruherd, for I myself am outcast twice over. Now come advise me on a matter of vital importance.\"\n \"I\u0027m, uh, all right where I am.\"\n \"I know you don\u0027t mean to be unsociable,\" said Pharaun, setting blue sparks dancing on his fingertips.\n The Duskryn sighed, and, limping in a manner that betrayed some chronic pain, did as Pharaun had bade him. He was gaunt, and half a dozen boils studded his neck and jaw. He\u0027d evidently parted with his piwafwiat some point during his decline, but he still wore a filthy robe that, the Mizzrym noted with mild surprise, had once been a wizard\u0027s. With the aid of the silver ring, he could see that the dozens of pockets no longer held the slightest trace of magic.\n \"They may kill me for this,\" Bruherd said, subtly indicating the goblins. \"They only tolerate me because they believe me cut off from my own race.\"\n \"I\u0027ll pray for your welfare,\" Pharaun said. \"Meanwhile, what I need to know is this: Of all the libations laid up in our host\u0027s no doubt vast and well-stocked cellar, which is the least vile?\"\n \"Vile?\" Bruherd\u0027s lip twitched. \"You get used to them.\"\n \"One hopes not.\"\n Pharaun handed the other drow a gold, hammer-shaped coin minted in some dwarf enclave.\n \"Tell the barkeep you want the stuff that bubbles,\" Bruherd advised.\n \"\u0027The stuff that bubbles.\u0027 Charming. Clearly, I\u0027ve fallen among connoisseurs.\"\n \"It\u0027ll do,\" said Ryld, still unobtrusively studying the crowd. \"The important thing is that we toast our victory.\"\n Pharaun waited a beat, then chuckled. \"You\u0027re supposed to ask him what he\u0027s talking about,\" he said to Bruherd, \"thus affording us a graceful way to commence boasting of our triumph.\"\n The lip twitched again. \"I don\u0027t think much about victories or triumphs anymore.\"\n Pharaun shook his head. \"So much bitterness in the world! It weighs on the heart. Would it cheer you to learn I\u0027ve avenged us in some small measure?\"\n \"Us?\" Bruherd grunted.\n Across the room, a scuffle erupted between a shaggy hobgoblin and a wolf-faced gnoll. As the combatants rolled about the floor, somebody tossed them a knife, apparently just out of curiosity as to which would manage to grab it first.\n \"Hark to the glad tidings,\" said the Master of Sorcere. \"I\u0027m Pharaun Mizzrym, expelled first from the Seventh House and now Tier Breche, neither time for any rational cause. Incensed, I chose to take vengeance on the Academy. With the aid of my similarly disgruntled friend Master Argith, I destroyed a patrol in the Bazaar earlier today. You may have heard something about it.\"\n Bruherd stared. The kobold and goblins within earshot did the same.\n \"It\u0027s true,\" said Ryld.\n \"That was you?\" Bruherd said. \"And you\u0027re bragging about it? Are you insane? They\u0027ll hunt you down!\"\n Pharaun said, \"They were trying anyway.\" The entire cellar was falling quiet. \"I\u0027ve heard rumors of an agency that will spirit a drow boy away if he\u0027s well and truly discontent with his lot in life, as I trust Ryld and I have shown we are.\"\n Bruherd said, \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n \"Well,\" Pharaun said, \"they probably have to think you can be of some use to them, and if you\u0027ll forgive my saying so . . .\"\n He caught a flash of movement from the corner of his eye, and turned just in time to see the taverner fall back in two pieces. Evidently he\u0027d been in the process of climbing silently over the bar with a short sword in hand, and Ryld, sensing him, had pivoted and cuthim. The drow warrior spun smoothly back around, Splitter at the ready.\n Pharaun turned back as well, just in time to see a mass of undercreatures rushing him. He snatched three smooth gray stones from a pocket and started to recite a spell. Ryld\u0027s greatsword nicked across the wizard\u0027s field of vision, killing two gnolls that sought to engage him, allowing him to finish the incantation unmolested.\n A cloud of vapor boiled into existence in front of him. Those orcs and goblins caught in the fumes collapsed. Others recoiled to avoid their touch.\n The fog blinked out of existence a heartbeat later.\n \"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t permit you to kill us and sell the corpses to the authorities,\" Pharaun told the crowd, \"and I\u0027m shocked - shocked! - you would even try. Aren\u0027t you pleased we massacred a patrol?\"\n \"They don\u0027t want the priestesses to find you here,\" said Bruherd. He hadn\u0027t made a move during the skirmish. Perhaps he\u0027d frozen, or maybe he\u0027d figured his best hope of survival lay in passivity. \"I don\u0027t, either. They\u0027re liable to kill us, too.\"\n \"How disappointing,\" Pharaun said. \"And here I thought Ryld and I had found a cozy enclave of kindred spirits. But of course we won\u0027t force our company on those who lack the ratified sensibility to appreciate it. Neither, however, will we quit this place before we slake our thirst. You goblins and whatnot will have to withdraw. Good evening.\"\n The undercreatures glowered. The mage could tell what they were thinking. They were many, and the intruders only two. Yet they\u0027d seen what those two could do, and after a few seconds, they started trudging out, leaving their unconscious comrades sprawled on the floor.\n \"You\u0027re crazy,\" Bruherd told the masters. \"You need to keep your heads down very low for a few years. Give the matrons and the Academy time to forget.\"\n \"Alas,\" Pharaun said, \"I suspect I\u0027m unforgettable. You too may depart If you can bear to tear yourself away.\"\n \"Crazy,\" the outcast repeated.\n He limped for the stairs and in a moment was gone like the rest.\n Pharaun walked behind the bar. \"Now,\" he said, \"to begin drow\u0027s eternal search forthe stuff that, bubbles.\"\n Ryld surveyed the slumbering goblins as if pondering whether to stick hissword in them.\n \"I still think this is a bad idea,\" the weapons master said.\n Careful not to soil his boots, Pharaun stepped around the two bloody pieces of the barkeep and inspected a rack of jugs and bottles.\n \"You always say that, and you\u0027re always mistaken. The goblinoids will carry word of our whereabouts far and wide. The rogues are bound to hear.\"\n \"As will your sister and everyone else we\u0027ve managed to annoy.\"\n Pharaun uncorked a jug. The pungent liquid inside didn\u0027t seem to be fizzing, so he moved on.\n \"Care to make a wager on who\u0027ll arrive first?\"\n \"Either way,\" Ryld snorted, \"we wind up dead.\"\n \"Had I wished to hear the dreary voice of pessimism, I would have detained our friend Bruherd,\" the wizard said as he inspected a jar full of cloudy liquid. \"Here\u0027s a jar of pickled sausages if you care to break your fast, but I won\u0027t vouch for the ingredients. I think I see a kobold\u0027s horn floating in the brine.\"\n He opened a glass bottle with a long, double-curved neck, and the contents hissed.\n \"Aha! I\u0027ve found the draught the Duskryn recommended.\"\n \"Someone\u0027s here,\" said Ryld.\n The mage turned. Two figures were descending the stairs. They looked like orcs, with coarse, tangled manes and lupine ears, but Pharaun\u0027s silver ring revealed that the appearance was an illusion, disguising dark elf males. The wizard saw the masks as translucent veils lying atop the reality.\n He conveyed the truth of the situation to Ryld with a rapid flexing and crooking of his fingers.\n \"Gentlemen,\" said the mage, \"well met! My comrade and I have been looking everywhere for you.\"\n \"We know,\" said the taller of the newcomers, evidently not surprised that a Master of Sorcere had instantly penetrated his disguise. He was Houndaer Tuin\u0027Tarl, one of the highest ranked of the missing males, likewise one of the first to elope, and thus almost certainly one of the ringleaders. Certainly he looked like a princely commander of lesser folk. His rich silk and velvet garments, the magical auras of many of his possessions, and strutting demeanor all proclaimed it. He wore crystals in his thick, flowing hair - a nice effect - had close-set eyes and a prominent jaw, and looked as if he knew how to manage the scimitar hanging at his side. He also looked rather tense.\n \"We\u0027ve known for a while,\" said the other stranger, whom Pharaun didn\u0027t recognize.\n At first glance, he appeared to be a nondescript commoner, with the squint and small hands of a craftsman proficient at fine work. However, the dagger tucked in his sash fairly blazed with potent enchantments, as did an object concealed within his jerkin. Evidently he\u0027d layered one disguise on another.\n \"Well,\" said Ryld, \"you took your time contacting us. I guess that\u0027s understandable.\"\n \"I think so,\" said Houndaer as he and his comrade advanced. A goblin moaned, and the noble kicked the creature silent. \"Why were you seeking us?\"\n \"It\u0027s our understanding,\" said Pharaun, stepping from behind the bar, \"that you offer a haven for males who find existence under the thumbs of their female relatives uncongenial and who, for whatever reason, aspire neither to the Academy, a merchant clan, nor Bregan D\u0027aerthe. If so, then we wish to join your company.\"\n \"But you two already did aspire to the Academy,\" the aristocrat said. \"You rose to high rank there. Some might say that gives my associates and I cause for concern.\"\n The orc mask\u0027s tusked mouth perfectly copied the motions of his actual lips. Pharaun couldn\u0027t have created a better illusion himself.\n \"You speak of the dead past,\" Pharaun said. \"You\u0027ve no doubt heard I\u0027m in disgrace, and Master Argith finds Melee-Magthere stale and tedious.\" The dark powers knew, his discontented friend shouldn\u0027t have much trouble convincing them of that. \"We require an alternative way of life.\"\n Houndaer nodded and replied, \"I\u0027m glad to hear it, but what assurances can you give that you aren\u0027t an agent the matrons sent to find us?\"\n Pharaun grinned. \"My solemn oath?\"\n Everyone chuckled, even Ryld and the boy with the dagger, who were both quietly, thoughtfully watching their more loquacious companions palaver.\n \"Seriously,\" the wizard continued, \"if our escapade in the Bazaar failed to convince you of our bona fides, I have no idea what other persuasion we can offer. But it didn\u0027t fail, did it? Otherwise, you wouldn\u0027t be here. So unless you perceive something in our manner that screams spy . . .\"\n The faux commoner smiled. \"You\u0027re right.\" He turned to Houndaer and added, \"They smell all right to me, and if they\u0027re not, I doubt a little quizzing in this stinking goblin hole will prove otherwise. Let\u0027s get them home before some servant of the clergy comes sniffingfor them and finds us. Either way, it\u0027ll all get sorted out in the end.\"\n For a moment, as the power of Pharaun\u0027s silver ring wavered, the drow\u0027s rnild, civilized tone became an orc\u0027s growl. He even smelled like a dirty undercreature.\n The Tuin\u0027Tarl\u0027s mouth tightened. Pharaun suspected he didn\u0027t much like taking advice from anyone, his companion included.\n \"I\u0027m just being careful - as should you - but you may have a point.\" He turned back to the masters and said, \"If we take you to our stronghold, there\u0027s no going back. You\u0027ll aid our cause or die.\"\n Pharaun grinned. \"Well spoken, and quite in the spirit of a thousand thousand conspiracies before you. Whisk us away.\"\n \"Gladly,\" the noble said with a mean little smile of his own, \"as soon as the two of you surrender your weapons and that cloak of pockets.\"\n The wizard crooked an eyebrow and said, \"I thought you\u0027d decided to trust us.\"\n \"It\u0027s time for you to show a little trust,\" Houndaer replied.\n Pharaun surrendered hispiwafwi.,hand crossbow, and dagger. He was a little worried about Ryld\u0027s willingness to do the same. He could easily imagine the warrior deciding that, in preference to entering the\n dragon\u0027s cave unarmed, he\u0027d subdue Houndaer and his companion there and then and wring what information out of them he could.\n The problem with that strategy was that the Tuin\u0027Tarl and his nameless companion might not be privy to all the mystic secrets held by the cabal as a whole, and those who were might flee when the two emissaries failed to return. Thus, while the masters would likely succeed in forestalling a goblin revolt, they\u0027d miss acquiring the extraordinary power they sought.\n Besides, it would be much more fun to join, and undo the rogues from within.\n Apparently Ryld shared Pharauns perspective, or else he was simply content to follow the wizard\u0027s lead, for he handed over Splitter and his other weapons to Houndaer without demur.\n The Tuin\u0027Tarl reached into his pouch, extracted a stone, and tossed it. It exploded in a strange, lopsided way, tearing a wound in the air, a gash the size and shape of a sarcophagus standing on end and the color of the light that swims inside closed eyelids.\n He gestured to the portal and said, \"After you.\"\n Pharaun smiled.\n \"Thank you.\"\n As easy as that? Pharaun thought. He was experiencing a certain sense of anticlimax, which was absurd, really. It had been astonishingly difficult to get this far.\n He stepped into the portal, and experienced none of the spinning vertigo of ordinary teleportation. Save for a split second of blindness, it was just like striding from one room to the next. The only problem was the drider waiting on the other side.\n The wizard struggled not to make a sound. Still, the huge creature, half spider, half drow, a bow in its hand and a quiver of arrows slung across its naked back, turned toward him. Pharaun had no fear of a single such aberration, but the goddess only knew just how elaborate this trap actually was. He whirled back toward the magical doorway just as Ryld came through.\n Ryld, who\u0027d slain his share of driders in the caverns surrounding Menzoberranzan, knew that this one - a hybrid creature with the head, arms, and torso of a dark elf male married to the body and segmented legs of a colossal spider - was larger than average; a robust example of its species, if species was the proper term. Nature didn\u0027t make them, magic did. Sometimes, when the goddess deemed one of her worshipers insufficiently reverent, the punishment was transformation at the hands of a circle of priestesses and a demon called a yochlol.\n The Master of Melee-Magthere naturally focused on the venomous aberration as soon as he stepped through the portal, but like every competent warrior - and unlike Pharaun, evidently - he also took in the disposition of the entire area.\n The portal had deposited them in a large, unfurnished hall with a number of openings along the wall. It was the sort of central hub used in castles to link the various wings. A couple males were wandering\n through, and while neither had ventured into the drider\u0027s immediate vicinity, they weren\u0027t preparing to attack him or flee from him, either. Nor did the creature himself appear on the verge of assaulting anyone, though he regarded the newcomers with a scowl.\n Somewhat pleased to be ahead of his clever friend for once, Ryld gripped Pharaun by the shoulder.\n \"Steady,\" the swordsman said. \"Don\u0027t embarrass yourself.\"\n The wizard looked around, then grinned and said, \"Right. Our friends didn\u0027t trick us into entering a trap. The drider\u0027s magically constrained.\"\n \"No.\"\n Ryld glanced back to see that the two bogus orcs had stepped through the portal, which dwindled to nothing behind them. It was the bigger and more talkative of the duo who was speaking.\n \"The driders help us of their own free will.\"\n \"Interesting,\" said Pharaun.\n In the blink of an eye, the goblinoids turned into an aristocratic warrior - Houndaer Tuin\u0027Tarl, specifically, whom Ryld had trained - and a craftsman of one sort or another. The prince closed the portal with a wave of his arm.\n \"Do you still use that second-intention indirect attack?\" Ryld asked. \"That was a nice move.\"\n For the first time, Houndaer smiled a smile that had neither malice nor suspicion in it.\n \"You remember that, Master? It\u0027s been so long, I\u0027m surprised you even remember me.\"\n \"I always remember the ones who truly learn.\"\n \"Well, thank you. It\u0027s good to have you with us, and you\u0027re going to be glad you are. Great things are in store.\" the noble said. The drider scuttled toward them. \"All, here comes Tsabrak. You\u0027ll see his mind isn\u0027t sluggish or otherwise crippled, yet he\u0027s on our side nonetheless.\"\n In point of fact, the drider didn\u0027t look especially congenial. The length of his legs lifted his head above those of the four dark elves, and he glared down at them with eyes full of madness and hate. Ryld inferred that Tsabrak had entered into a typical Menzoberranyr alliance. He\u0027d thrown in with the runaways to secure some practical advantage, but he still loathedall the drow who\u0027d deformed him and cast him out.\n \"What is this?\" the drider snarled, exposing his fangs. They seemed to impede his speech a trifle. \"Syrzan said no!\"\n Syrzan wasn\u0027t a typical drow name, but Ryld had no idea to which other race it might belong. He glanced over at Pharaun, who conveyed with a subtle shrug that he didn\u0027t know, either.\n \"Syrzan is my ally, not my superior,\" said Houndaer, glaring back at the spider-thing. \"I make my own decisions, and I\u0027ve decided these gentlemen can help us. They\u0027re masters of Tier Breche - \"\n \"I know who they are!\" Tsabrak screamed, flecks of foam, perhaps mixed with venom, flying from his lips. \"Do you think me a mindless beast? I studied on Tier Breche the same as anyone!\"\n \"Then you know how useful their talents could be,\" said the craftsman, \"and how unlikely it is they can do us any harm, particularly now that the prince has disarmed them.\"\n \"Just point us to Syrzan,\" Houndaer said. \"It will allay your fears.\"\n It? Ryld wondered.\n \"I can\u0027t,\" the drider said. \"It\u0027s gone off somewhere.\"\n \"Where?\" Houndaer asked.\n \"Agitating slaves? Acquiring more magic fire from its secret source? How do I know? You\u0027ll just have to sit on these two until it gets back.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right,\" the noble said. \"Master Argith and I can reminisce \u0027bout old times. We\u0027ll all wait in the room where Syrzan interviewed the other recruits.\"\n \"Perhaps you\u0027d care to tag along,\" the craftsman said, \"to make absolutely sure the masters don\u0027t cause any trouble.\"\n Pharaun beamed up at the bloodthirsty aberration and asked, \"Please? There are half a dozen questions concerning drider existence that have perplexed me for years.\"\n Tsabrak ignored him, instead glowering at Houndaer and the artisan as if he suspected them of playing a trick on him.\n Finally, he said, \"Yes. I\u0027ll go. Somebody with sense needs to be there.\"\n \"Fine.\" Houndaer nodded to Ryld and Pharaun and said, \"Come this way.\"\n The masters and their hosts, or captors, set off through a maze of passageways. As promised, Pharaun treated Tsabrak to a barrage of questions, and, when the drider failed to respond, cheerfully answered himself with a gush of scholarly speculation.\n Ryld paid little attention. He was too busy studying the rogues\u0027 citadel, a forlorn and dusty place where Pharaun\u0027s monologue echoed away into the quiet. No servants were in evidence, merely runaway males and driders, who often recognized their former instructors and curiously peered after them. The marks of magical attacks, bursts of lightning and sprays of acid, scarred thewalls.\n By all appearances, the conspirators were hiding in the seat of a House extinguished by its enemies. No one was supposed to take possession of such a fortress without the Baenre\u0027s permission, and few would dare. The vacant castles were supposedly cursed and haunted places, breeding grounds for sickness, insanity, and bad luck. As if to compound the potential for ill fortune, the squatters had broken the copious shrouds of spiderweb wherever they impeded traffic and even in corners where they didn\u0027t.\n At one point, the masters and their warders passed a row of small octagonal windows. The glass was gone but the molded calcite frames remained. Ryld glanced out and saw mansions shining green and violet far below. The rogues had taken a stalactite castle,hanging from the cavern ceiling, for their hiding\n place. No doubt the isolation had attracted them.\n A minute later, the little procession reached its destination, a chapel with rows of benches, a crooked aisle snaking up the middle to an asymmetrical basalt altar, and murals, agleam with silvery phosphorescence, carved in bas-relief on the walls and ceiling. To Ryld\u0027s surprise, these last depicted not the Demonweb but other hells entirely devoid of spiders, yochlols, or the goddess Lolth herself. Apparently the House that once abode here had sacrificed to forbidden deities. Perhaps that transgression had contributed to its downfall.\n The dark elves settled themselves in the pews. While Houndaer and the commoner seemed convinced of the masters\u0027 claim of estrangement from Tier Breche, they nonetheless retained possession of the newcomers\u0027 gear. Tsabrak crouched just inside the door, his legs splayed out on either side of the entrance.\n \"I admire the decor,\" Pharaun said. \"Without even trying, I noticed images of Cyric, Orcus, Bane, Ghaunadaur, and Vhaeraun. Quite a nice selection of patron powers for the discriminating worshiper.\"\n \"We\u0027re not looking for a new god,\" Houndaer spat.\n \"I\u0027m sure,\" the wizard said. \"Perhaps you\u0027d be kind enough to tell Master Argith and me what your grand and glorious schemeis all about. And why now?\"\n \"Why now?\" the noble asked.\n \"Our fellowship has existed for decades,\" the craftsman cut in, \"though it\u0027s only recently that we all eloped and took up residence here full time. Formerly we merely gathered for an hour or two every fortnight or so.\"\n \"If you\u0027re a male,\" Houndaer said, \"and utterly dissatisfied with your place in Menzoberranzan, you need some sort of a refuge, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"I quite agree,\" the wizard said. \"Of course, others have opted for a merchant House, the Academy, or Bregan D\u0027aerthe.\"\n Houndaer made a spitting sound. \"Those are just places to hide from the matrons. This is a fortress for males who want to turn Menzoberranzan upside down and put ourselves on top. Why not? Aren\u0027t our mages and even our warriors as powerful as the clergy?\"\n Pharaun grinned and said, \"They certainly are now that the priestesses have mislaid their magic.\"\n Houndaer blinked. \"You know about that?\"\n \"I\u0027ve inferred it. You obviously know as well. Otherwise, you wouldn\u0027t run about breaking spiderwebs simply for the fun of it, to say nothing of putting your master plan into motion. I\u0027d be curious to hear how you found out and if you know why.\"\n \"We don\u0027t know why,\" Houndaer said, shaking his head. \"We started to figure it out after a couple of us saw priestesses die fighting gricks out in the Bauthwaf. The bitches should\u0027ve used spells to save themselves, but they didn\u0027t, and we guessed it was because they couldn\u0027t. After that, we kept our eyes open and waylaid a few clerics to see what they\u0027d do to defend themselves. Everything we learned supported our theory.\"\n Pharaun sighed and said, \"Then you aren\u0027t in touch with some chatty informant in the realms of the divine. Like me, you merely observed and deduced. What a pity. Aren\u0027t you, in your ignorance, apprehensive that Lolth will rekindle the priestesses\u0027 magic just when it\u0027s least convenient?\"\n \"Maybe the goddess turned against the clergy because it\u0027s our turn to rule,\" said the commoner. \"Who\u0027s to say? In any case, this is our chance, and we\u0027re taking it.\"\n \"Your chance to do what?\" asked Ryld. \"You talk as if you intend to revolt, but instead you\u0027re inciting the slaves into an uprising.\"\n Houndaer cursed. \"You know that, too?\"\n \"We stumbled on it while looking for you,\" Pharaun explained. He brushed a stray strand of his coiffure back into place. His white hair shone like ghost flesh in the soft light shining from the carvings. \"As Master Argith noted, on first inspection, whipping the undercreatures into a lather would seem irrelevant to your objective.\"\n \"Look deeper,\" the noble said. \"We\u0027re canny enough to know we can\u0027t topple the matriarchy all at once. Even without their spells, our mothers and sisters are too powerful. They have too many talismans, fortresses, and, most importantly, troops and vassals serving out of fear.\"\n \"I begin to comprehend, and I apologize for not giving you sufficient credit,\" Pharaun said. \"This is merely the opening gambit in asava game that will last a number of years.\"\n \"When fighting engulfs Menzoberranzan,\" Houndaer said, \"and the clerics cast no spells to put down the revolt, their weakness will become apparent to everyone. Meanwhile, our brotherhood will take advantage of the chaos to assassinate those females who pose the greatest obstacles to our ambitions. With luck, the orcs will account for a few more. At the end of the day, our gender\u0027s position in the scheme of things will be considerably stronger, and every male in the city will start aspiring to supremacy.\n \"In the years to come, our cabal will do whatever we can to diminish the females and put ourselves in their place. One day soon, we\u0027ll see a noble House commanded by a male and eventually, a master in every House.\"\n He smiled and added, \"Needless to say, a master who belongs to this fraternity. I\u0027ll enjoy ruling over House Tuin\u0027Tarl, and I imagine that you, Brother of Sorcere, wouldn\u0027t say no to primacy over your own family.\"\n Pharaun nodded and said, \"You\u0027re far too canny to have forgotten we\u0027ve all gone rogue. . . .\"\n \"Our kin will welcome us back once we\u0027ve weakened them to the point where they\u0027re desperate for reinforcements. We\u0027ll concoct tales of travels to the far ends of the Underdark, or something. It won\u0027t matter to them when they\u0027re desperate enough.\"\n \"Indeed, you\u0027ve plotted everything out so shrewdly that I only see one potential pitfall, Pharaun said. \"What if the goblins and gnolls should actuallysucceedin slaughtering us all, or at least inflicting such damage on our city that the devastation breaks our hearts?\"\n Houndaer stared at the mage for a moment, then laughed. \"For a moment, I almost thought you serious.\"\n Pharaun grinned. \"Forgive me. I have a perverse fondness for japes at inappropriate moments, as Master Argith will attest.\"\n Houndaer smiled at Ryld and said, \"I\u0027d just as soon hear him attest that I mastered all those lessons on strategy he pounded into my skull.\"\n \"You did,\" said Ryld, and perhaps it was true. His instincts told him that this scheme, outlandish as it seemed, might work, and he abruptly realized he didn\u0027t know how he felt about the possibility.\n He and Pharaun had infiltrated the rogues to betray them, to placate the archmage, and because the Mizzrym wizard had some vague notion that they\u0027d achieve greater status and power and thus a permanent cure for Ryld\u0027s formless dissatisfaction, thereby. Yet now the conspirators were offering high rank and a role in a grand adventure. Perhaps, then, the teachers should become in truth the rebels they were pretending to be.\n The warrior glanced over at Pharaun. With a flick of his fingers so subtle that no one else would notice, the wizard signed one word in the silent language:Persevere.\n Ryld took it to mean that his friend, with his usual acuity, had divined what he was thinking and was urging him to hold to their original intent. He gave a tiny nod of assent. He didn\u0027t know if Pharaun was making a wise choice, but he did realize he wouldn\u0027t even be here listening to this apocalyptic talk if his friend hadn\u0027t asked for his aid. When all was said and done, Ryld had descended from Melee-Magthere to help the wizard achievehis ends, and that was what he was going to do.\n Pharaun turned to Tsabrak and said, \"I assume the driders have allied themselves with the conspiracy because the boys promised you a place of honor in the splendid Menzoberranzan to come. Perhaps they even pledged to find a way to transform you back into a drow.\"\n \"Something like that,\" Tsabrak sneered. \"Mainly, though, those of us who joined did it for the chance to kill lots and lots of priestesses.\"\n \"I can\u0027t say I blame you,\" Pharaun said. \"Well, gentlemen, your plans are inspiring to say the least. I\u0027m glad we sought you out.\"\n \"So am I,\" said Ryld.\n \"The only things I\u0027m still hazy on,\" the mage continued, \"are Syrzan and the Prophet one and the same? I see by your expressions that they are. Who is ...it really, and what power does it use to so enthrall the goblins?\"\n \"I think you\u0027re about to find out,\" Houndaer said.\n An instant later, something droned through the air, almost like a noise, but not. Actually, the sensation existed solely within the mind. Pharaun turned, and Tsabrak scuttled aside to reveal the robed figure in the doorway. Ryld felt a jolt of dismay. Afraid it was already too late, he sprang up from the bench. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dissolution-war-of-the-spider-queen-1/page-17.html","bookId":2159,"book":{"id":2159,"title":"Dissolution (War of the Spider Queen #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Dissolution (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
