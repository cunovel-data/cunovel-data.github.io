{"id":97648,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Her pack weighting her shoulders, her heart pounding, Waerva turned and peered about. The cave stretched out before her and behind, with stalactites stabbing down from the ceiling and stalagmites jutting up from the uneven floor. Nothing moved. What, then, had she heard? As if in response to her unspoken question, a drop of falling water plopped somewhere in the passages ahead. It was one of the most common sounds of the Underdark, and scarcely a harbinger of peril. Waerva wiped sweat from her brow and scowled at her own jumpiness. She had good reason to be edgy, though. Everyone said it was suicide to travel the subterranean wilderness alone. Sadly, thanks to the cursed goblin rebellion, she had little choice. Because of the desperate fighting all across the city, the clergy\u0027s incapacity was no great secret anymore. Certainly Gromph had discerned it, which meant Triel no longer had anything to hide from him. Surely, then, she would seek his counsel once more. Waerva had been confident she could manipulate the frazzled matron mother, but she very much doubted she could fool the canny archmage. Accordingly, she\u0027d cleared out of the Great Mound and Menzoberranzan itself before her kinsman could start asking questions, and there she was, a solitary wayfarer hiking through a perilous wilderness. But she was strong and cunning, and she\u0027d survive. She\u0027d make her way to her secret allies, and everything would be all right. She took four more strides, then heard another little sound, and this one wasn\u0027t falling water. It sounded more like a stealthy footstep brushing stone, and it came from behind her. She whirled and saw no one, then something stung her arm. She pivoted. At her feet lay the pebble someone had thrown. Soft, sibilant laughter rippled through the air. From the sound of it, the merrymakers were all around her. Why, then, couldn\u0027t she see them? Adamantine mace at the ready, one wing of herpiwafwitossed back to facilitate the action of her weapon arm, Waerva advanced in the direction from which the rock had come. Weaving her way through the stalagmites, she reached the cavern wall without so much as glimpsing her attacker. She caught a whiff of a familiar reptilian musk, though, and she knew. Kobolds. The horned, scaly undercreatures were small enough that it was relatively easy for them to hide amid the calcite bumps and spikes. She turned once more, and despite herself, gave a start. Evidently the kobolds lacked the patience to play their skulking game for very long, because they were done hiding. While her back was turned, they\u0027d crept out into the open and there formed a ragged C-shaped line to pen her against the wall. The brutes were Menzoberranyr thralls. House brands and whip scars gave that fact away. Indeed, a couple still wore broken shackles. Waerva plainly wasn\u0027t the only one who\u0027d fled the city. She glared at the kobolds and said, \"I\u0027m a Baenre. You know what that means. Make way, or I\u0027ll strike you dead.\" The undercreatures stared back at her for a moment, then lowered their eyes. The line broke in the middle, making an exit. Sneering, head held high, Waerva srarted for the opening. Fora moment, all was silent, then the reptiles laughed, screeched, and rushed her. Bellowing a battle cry, she swung her mace, and every stroke smashed the life from a thrall. But for every one she killed, there were dozens more hacking and beating at her legs. Her knee screamed with pain, and she fell. The kobolds swarmed over her and pounded her until she just couldn\u0027t struggle any more. With some difficulty, they divested her of her armor and clothing, and went to work on her. Amazingly for such a bestial race, they seemed to understand anatomy as thoroughly as her dear Tluth, but their ministrations were nothing like massage. Faeryl had learned to court unconsciousness. It brought surcease from the lingering pains of past tortures. Unfortunately, it couldn\u0027t avert new ones. When Jeggred found her so, he simply waved a bottle of pungent smelling salts beneath her nose until it jolted her awake. She could hear him coming. So could the jailers, who scurried to the back of the dungeon to give him privacy. Shivering, she struggled to compose herself. Perhaps she could deny him the satisfaction of a scream - at least for a while - or even provoke him into killing her. That would be wonderful. The draegloth appeared in the doorway, stooping to pass through. Despite herself, Faeryl flinched, then saw he was not alone. Dainty little Triel accompanied him. So did her harsh-featured brother, clad as usual in the Robes of the Archmage. \"My . . . salutations, Matron,\" the Zauvirr croaked. \"Hush,\" said Gromph, \"and all will be well.\" He looked up at the glowering half-demon. \"Free her, and be gentle about it.\" Jeggred strode to Faeryl. This time, she managed not to cringe. The draegloth supported her weight with his smaller hands while cutting her bonds with the claws of the larger ones, then scooped her up in his arms. She passed out. Next came a blur of hours or days, during which she would wake for a few muddled seconds, then lapse into unconsciousness again. She lay on a soft divan, where servants salved and bandaged her wounds and sometimes spooned broth into her mouth. Priestesses read scrolls of healing, and Gromph appeared periodically to cast his own spells over her. She noticed Mother\u0027s Kiss lying on a little table beside her, and when she felt strong enough, stretched out her trembling arm and touched it. Finally she opened her eyes to find her thoughts clear and vitality tingling in her limbs. The servants helped her don new raiment. They said it was for a meeting with Triel. Faeryl considered taking her warhammer along, then thought better of it. If her rehabilitation was an elaborate prank, if the Baenre was summoning her to further torment, the weapon wouldn\u0027t save her. Her legs still the least bit unsteady, she followed a male through the endless corridors of the Great Mound. Eventually he opened the door to a small but lavishly decorated room. Triel sat at the table in the center of the space, with two bodyguards standing against the wall behind her. Faeryl inferred that this was a chamber the matron used when she wished to palaver away from the formal trappings of her court. The Baenre rose and took her prisoner\u0027s hands. \"My child,\" Triel said, \"I rejoice to see you. Some folk said you wouldn\u0027t recover, but I never doubted it. I knew you were strong, a true drow princess favored of Lolth.\" \"Thank you, Matron,\" said Faeryl, thoroughly perplexed. Triel conducted her a chair. \"You\u0027ll be glad to know we caught them,\" the matron said. \"Them?\" \"The brigands who waylaid you and murdered your followers, who left you for dead in that place where my servant Valas found you. I supervised the executions myself.\" Faeryl was beginning to comprehend her situation. For some reason, Triel had forgiven her her disobedience. The Zauvirr could go free, her honor and rank restored, but there was a catch. Henceforth, she would have to endorse the fiction that Triel was in no way responsible for any of her misfortunes. For after all, the sovereign of Menzoberranzan was a perfect being, whom the Spider Queen herself had exalted above all others. How, then, could she possibly make a mistake? It rankled a little, but Faeryl was more than willing to embrace the lie to avoid a return to the dungeon. \"Thank you, Matron,\" she said. \"Thank you with all my heart.\" Triel waved her hand, and a servant brought wine. \"Do you still want to go home?\" the Baenre asked. Pharaun had been summoned to a good many audiences in the course of his checkered career, and it had been his experience that no matter how urgent the occasion, one generally wound up parked in an antechamber for a while. Matron Baenre\u0027s waiting area was considerably more lavish than most, and in ordinary circumstances, he would have amused himself by passing esthetic judgment on the decor. Instead he had to address another matter, for when he arrived, Ryld was sitting on a chair in the corner, half hidden behind a marble statue. The carving depicted a beautiful female doing something unpleasant to a deep gnome, for the greater glory of the Dread Queen of Spiders,one assumed. The Mizzrym hadn\u0027t spoken to his friend since the slaughter of the renegades. He supposed the time had come. But first he paid his respects to Quenthel, who, much to her annoyance, was being kept waiting as well. The mage then bowed to a stern-faced drow male, looking ill at ease and out of place in rough outdoorsman\u0027s clothes and ugly trinkets. Pharaun didn\u0027t know him. \"Valas Hune,\" the warrior said, \"of Bregan D\u0027aerthe.\" Pharaun introduced himself, then strolled toward the Master of Melee-Magthere. \"Ryld!\" the wizard said. \"Good afternoon! Have you any idea why the Council summoned us?\" The burly swordsman rose and said, \"No.\" \"To shower us with honors, one assumes. How are you?\" \"Alive.\" \"I rejoice to hear it. I was concerned because I could tell that warriors trance strained even your constitution.\" For a moment, the two masters regarded one another in silence. \"My friend,\" Pharaun said, having lowered his voice. \"I truly regret what happened.\" \"What you did was tactically sound,\" said Ryld. \"It was what any sensible drow would have done. I hold no grudge.\" The wizard looked into weapons master\u0027s eyes and realized that for the first time, he couldn\u0027t read him. Perhaps Ryld meant what he was saying, but it was just as likely he was lying, lulling his betrayer\u0027s suspicions to facilitate some eventual revenge. Thus, while Pharaun might continue to observe the forms of their long friendship, he could never trust his fellow master again. For a moment he felt a pang of loss, but he quashed the sensation. Friendship and trust were for lesser races. They weakened a dark elf, and he was better off without them. Pharaun gave Ryld an affectionate clap on the shoulder, just as he had a thousand times before. When the tall doors opened, all eight Matrons of the Council sat enthroned and illuminated on an eight-tiered pyramid of a dais, with Triel of course set higher than the others, and a span of radiant marble webbing arching overhead. Quenthel stalked in proudly, ahead of Pharaun and the other males, and why not? She was Mistress of Arach-Tinilith and a Baenre. Truth to tell, a miniscule part of her, a part she loathed and repudiated, hadn\u0027t wanted to come in, because her unknown enemy was very likely in the room The matriarchs weren\u0027t the only folk in the vicinity of the platform. A symbol of the goddess\u0027s favor and a source of practical protection, Jeggred loomed behind Triel\u0027s chair. Servants scurried about the steps to do the great ladies\u0027 bidding. Gromph stood on the highest riser, a place of ultimate honor for a male. When she, the mage, the weapons master, and the mercenary reached the foot of the dais, Triel began to praise them for their efforts against the illithilich and its pawns. At first the oration was pretty much what Quenthel had expected, but soon it took an unexpected turn. She herself would lead an expedition to Ched Nasad to find out why no travelers came from that direction, and what the priestesses of the vassal city might know concerning the silence of Lolth. Ryld Argith, Pharaun Mizzrym, and Valas Hune would serve as her lieutenants, accompanying the ambassador, Faeryl Zauvirr. Upon hearing the news, the hulking warrior in the dwarven breastplate simply inclined his head in acquiescence. The wizard grinned, and the scout smiled. At first the envoy, who was standing nearby, looked equally pleased. Then Triel said, \"Finally, dear sister, I lend you my own son Jeggred for your journey. A draegloth carries the blessing of the Dark Mother, and you may need his strength.\" For an instant, it looked as if Faeryl would protest, and Jeggred leered down at her. Plainly, something had once transpired between them, an unpleasantness that made the ambassador loathe and mistrust him. Gromph shifted his weight as well and Quenthel thought he looked surprised, even a bit put out. Perhaps he hadn\u0027t thought Triel had sense enough to want her own special agent on the mission, a minion devoted to her particular interests alone. A thousand arguments against her being sent away at so uncertain a time for Menzoberranzan, the faith, House Baenre . . . came to Quenthel in a rush. Ultimately, however, she said nothing. The assembly discussed the practicalities of their scheme for an hour or so, and Triel dismissed her newly appointed emissaries. Pharaun caught up with Quenthel in the antechamber. He bowed to her, and she waved her hand, giving him permission to speak. \"I assume, Mistress, that you know why they picked us?\" he murmured. \"I understand better than you,\" she said. Pharaun arched an eyebrow and asked, \"Indeed. Will you elucidate?\" She hesitated, but why not state at least the obvious? He had come to her, after all, when the slave revolt began. He was a true drow - - ambitious and ruthless enough that she could always trust him to do what was to his advantage. Gromph had made him a decoy and a target, perhaps someday she would make him Archmage of Menzoberranzan. \"My brother and sister send us both forth because they fear our ambitions.\" \"I daresay that\u0027s very sensible of them,\" Pharaun said. \"Does this mean you undertake our errand reluctantly?\" \"By no means. Whatever my siblings\u0027 motives, the plan has merit, and I would go anywhere and do anything to restore my bond with Lolth and save Menzoberranzan; it is of course the same thing.\" In fact, she was eager to distance herself from them until such time as she recovered her magic, provided she could do it without a loss of status, and surprisingly, it seemed she could. The matter of the demonic assassins had still not been settled, too, and she wondered if her leaving the city would bring her unknown assailant into the open. She looked her foppish companion up and down. \"What of you?\" she asked the wizard. \"You\u0027re brave enough - I\u0027ve seen the proof - but still, are you eager to march across the Underdark?\" \"You mean, can an exquisite specimen such as myself bear to dispense with warm, scented baths, succulent meals, and delicate, freshly laundered attire?\" Pharaun asked with a grin, \"It will be excruciating, but under the circumstances, I\u0027ll manage. I enjoy unraveling mysteries, particularly when I suspect I might enhance my personal power thereby.\" \"Perhaps you will,\" Quenthel said, \"but I recommend you keep your hands off any prize your leader covets for herself.\" \"Of course, Mistress, of course.\" The Master of Sorcere bowed low. Pharaun cast a spell, then slipped through the closed door like a ghost. On the other side was a drab, stale-smelling little room. Wrapped in a blanket like an invalid, her scarred face a mask of bitterness, Greyanna sat in the only chair. For an instant, she stared at him stupidly, then started to throw off the cover, presumably with the intent of jumping up. He lifted his hands as if to cast a spell, and the threat froze her in place. \"What a dreary habitation,\" he said. \"It was Sabal\u0027s, wasn\u0027t it, when her fortunes were at their nadir. Mother has a good memory and a charming sense of irony as well.\" \"And she\u0027ll kill you, outcast, for breaking into the castle.\" \"I always assumed so. That\u0027s one reason I never paid you a visit hitherto. But our circumstances have changed. The Council needs me to help determine what\u0027s become of the Spider Queen, and you, dear sib, are no longer a person of any importance. As Miz\u0027ri\u0027s demoted you for your repeated failures to kill me, I doubt she\u0027ll make an issue of your extinction, even if she\u0027s certain I\u0027m responsible. Shesmiled atme this afternoon when I saw her in House Baenre, can you believe it? She must have decided she\u0027d like me to resign from Sorcere and rejoin the family someday. Evidently she\u0027s just realizing how powerful I\u0027ve become in the decades since you chased me out the door.\" \"I\u0027m surprised you still want to kill me,\" Greyanna said. \"You\u0027ve already defeated and ruined me. Death may prove a mercy.\" \"I considered that, but I\u0027m going on a journey into the unknown, a quest fraught with peril and adversity to be sure, and I need something special to hearten me, a memory fraught with spectacle and drama to cheer me on the trail.\" \"I suppose I understand,\" the priestess said, \"but I wonder why it\u0027s come to this. All these years, I\u0027ve never truly understood the basis for our feud. If I\u0027m to die, will you at least tell me why you chose Sabal over me? Was it fondness? Was it lust?\" \"Neither,\" Pharaun chuckled. \"My choice had nothing whatever to do with personalities. How could it, when you twins were so alike? I threw in with Sabal simply because she was dangling from thebottom rung of the Mizzrym ladder. I thought it would be an amusing challenge to lift her to the top.\" \"Thank you for explaining,\" Greyanna said. \"Now die.\" Pharaun\u0027s own living rapier leaped from beneath the blanket. Obviously Greyanna had not only claimed the fallen weapon but figured out how to control it. No doubt she\u0027d been wearing it in its steel-ring form when he entered the room. Knowing how he loved to talk, she\u0027d lulled him with conversation and took him by surprise. The long, thin-bladed sword hurtled across the room toward Pharaun\u0027s chest. He frantically shifted to the side, and the point plunged into his left forearm instead. For a second, he couldn\u0027t feel the puncture, and it flared with pain. He had to immobilize the weapon or it would pull itself free and attack again. He grabbed hold of the blade with his right hand, and it sliced into his palm. A rapier was made for thrusting, but it had sharp edges even so. Sharp enough, anyway. At the same instant, Greyanna cast off the blanket and snatched a mace from behind her chair. She jumped up and charged. Pharaun narrowly dodged her first swing, then threw himself against her, ramming her with his shoulder. The impact knocked her stumbling backward. It didn\u0027t hurt her, though. She laughed and advanced on him again. He knew why she was so exhilarated. She thought that with his left hand dangling at the end of a spastic arm and the right busy gripping the rapier, he wouldn\u0027t be able to cast any appropriate spells to fend her off. And she was right. Edging away from Greyanna, his hand dripping blood, he let go of the living sword and started to conjure, rapidly as only a master could. His sister rushed him. The rapier jerked itself out of hiswound, hurting him anew. It pivoted in the air and aimed itself at his heart. Five darts of azure force shot from his right hand into Greyanna\u0027s body. She made a sighing sound and collapsed, her mace clanking against the floor. At once the rapier became inert, and fell clattering to the floor. He studied Greyanna, making sure she was truly dead, then examined his own wounds. They were unpleasant, bur a healing potion or two would mend them. \"Thank you, sister,\" he said, \"for a most inspiring interlude. When I sally forth to save our beloved Menzoberranzan, it will be with a heart full of joy.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dissolution-war-of-the-spider-queen-1/page-25.html","bookId":2159,"book":{"id":2159,"title":"Dissolution (War of the Spider Queen #1)","description":"Storyline: Dissolution (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
