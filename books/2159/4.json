{"id":97628,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Tall and lithe, the left side of her otherwise handsome face creased with an old battle scar of which, she recognized, she was rather foolishly proud, Greyanna Mizzrym entered her mother\u0027s presence dirty, sweaty, and still clad in her mail shirt. Greyanna knew Mother didn\u0027t like for her daughters and other chattels to come to meet with her fully armed, but she had an excuse. She\u0027d just returned from an inspection tour of Mizzrym operations in Bauthwaf - \"around-cloak,\" as the dangerous network of tunnels immediately surrounding Menzoberranzan was called - only to hear from a frantic functionary bearing the fresh marks of a whip of fangs that the matron mother wished to see her as soon as possible.\n Actually, even knowing the articles likely wouldn\u0027t save her if things went horribly wrong, Greyanna rather liked having a justification to walk in on her parent with her mace in her hand and her shield on her arm. She couldn\u0027t think of any reason why Mother would have decided to kill her at this particular point in time, but one could never be altogether sure, could one?\n Certainly not with Miz\u0027ri Mizzrym, a female regarded even by other dark elves as excessively and capriciously cruel. She sat enthroned in her temple with all ofher weaponsand protections ready to hand, the six-headed whip and the purple rod of tentacles, the enchanted rings gleaming on her fingers. She might have been considered comely even by the exacting standards of her exquisite race, except that her mouth drew down in an ugly and all but perpetual scowl. She regarded her daughter\u0027s martial appointments coldly but without comment.\n Greyanna lowered her head and spread her hands, offering the proper obeisance, and said, \"Matron Mother. You wished to see me?\"\n \"I wished to see you yesterday.\"\n \"I wasoff conducting family business.\" Of course, Mother knew that as well as she did. \"We have to keep up with our duties even now. Especially now - as you yourself have observed on more than one occasion.\"\n \"Watch your insolent tongue!\"\n Greyanna sighed. \"Yes, Mother. I apologize. I didn\u0027t mean to speak out of turn.\"\n \"See that you refrain from doing so again.\"\n Miz\u0027ri fell silent, perhaps to gather her thoughts, perhaps simply in an effort to rattle her daughter\u0027s nerves. Such petty, pointless attempts at intimidation were virtually a reflex with her.\n Greyanna wondered if a servant had been instructed to fetch her a chair for the remainder of the interview. It didn\u0027t look like it. That was typical of her mother as well.\n \"Your brother Pharaun ...\" Miz\u0027ri said at last.\n Greyanna\u0027s eyes opened wide. \"Yes?\"\n \"I think it might finally be time for the two of you to get reacquainted.\"\n The younger female held her scarred features calm and composed. It was rarely a good idea to show strong emotion to anyone, particularly Mother. If you showed her that something mattered to you, she would find a way to hurt you with it. Even so, Greyanna couldn\u0027t quite suppress a shiver of anticipation.\n She and her twin sister Sabal had loathed one another from the cradle onward. Of course, in the noble Houses of Menzoberranzan, rivalry between sisters was expected and encouraged. Certainly Miz\u0027ri encouraged it, perhaps simply for her own amusement. But for some reason - perhaps it had something to do with the fact that outwardly, they were identical - her daughters\u0027 enmity far transcended even her expectations. It was more bitter and more personal. Each yearned to injure and thwart the other for its own sake at least as much as to improve her own relative standing in the family.\n All but choking on their loathing of one another, they fought a duel that lasted decades and encompassed every facet of their existence, and gradually, on every battlefield, Greyanna began to prevail. She sabotaged many of Sabal\u0027s plans to enhance the fortunes of House Mizzrym and found ways to take credit for those that succeeded. By secretly tainting some of the sacred articles in this very shrine, she ensured that her twin\u0027s public rituals would fail to produce even the feeblest sign that the Spider Queen found her worship acceptable. She sowed doubt about Sabal\u0027s competence and loyalty in the ears of everyone who would listen.\n Over time, Greyanna rose to become her mother\u0027s most valued aide, while Sabal was seen as a dolt fit only for the simplest of tasks. She was forbidden the use of her family\u0027s more powerful magical artifacts, lest she break them or turn them to some ill-conceived purpose. From kin to slave warriors, any member of the household who might once have supported her aspirations shunned her as if she were diseased. At that point, Greyanna could have killed her easily, and she expected she\u0027d get around to it eventually, but Sabal\u0027s misery was so satisfying that she put it off.\n Put if off until Pharaun came home from Sorcere.\n Before her little brother departed to Tier Breche, Greyanna had barely noticed him. Of course, you didn\u0027t pay attention to young males unless you were unlucky enough to be put in charge of them. They were the silent little shadows creeping about the house, cleaning, ever cleaning, straining to master their inherent magical abilities, and learning their subordinate place in the world, all under the impatient eyes - and whips - of their minders. As far as she could remember, Pharaun had been as cowed and pathetic as the rest.\n The Academy transformed him into something considerably more interesting, though, to say nothing of dangerous. Perhaps it was mastering the formidable powers of wizardry, or maybe it was immersion in an enclave comprised entirely of males, but somehow he emerged from his schooling polished, clever, and bold, possessed of a sharp wit and glib tongue that frequently danced him up to the brink of chastisement and safely back again.\n Amazingly, he threw in with Sabal, who had all but abandoned hope of ever climbing higher than her current degraded estate. To this day, Greyanna could only explain his decision by positing a perverse and unnatural bond between them, but whatever his reasons, with the help of Pharaun\u0027s ideas, advocacy, and magic, Sabal essayed new ventures, succeeded brilliantly, and began to scale the ladder of status once more. She did so more quickly than Greyanna could have imagined, and the family came once more to\n regard the twins as peers, equal in merit and promise. Accordingly, their private war resumed, even more vicious and murderous than before, but this time Sabal - say Pharaun, rather - proved a match for her.\n Greyanna tried to break the stalemate by convincing Pharaun to change sides. She expected it to work, for after all, she and Sabal looked exactly alike and shared precisely the same prospects. Why, then, should the wizard not throw in with the stronger, shrewder sister who had risen to the top of House Mizzrym without his help? Think of the triumphs they could accomplish together! Though inwardly sickened by the prospect, she even smiled lasciviously and offered him the inducement she believed Sabal had given him.\n Her brother laughed at her. It was at that instant that Greyanna came to hate him just as savagely as she did her sister.\n Perhaps she owed him a debt for his cutting mockery. Conceivably, it goaded her to new heights of ingenuity, for it was shortly afterward that she hit on the stratagem that would destroy Sabal.\n A band of gray dwarves had been raiding in the tunnels southeast of the city, and Sabal was leading the force endeavoring to hunt the bandits down. Taking extraordinary measures, driving her agents, whether mortal, elemental, or demonic, relentlessly, Greyanna located the duergar in advance of her twin. Then came the hard part. She and her helpers had to abduct one of the slate-colored little males without the knowledge of his fellows, equip him with a platinum amulet that her subordinate clerics, mages, and her personal jeweler had created in an amazingly brief time, bind the marauder with spells of forgetfulness and persuasion, and slip him back among his friends.\n Sabal found the duergar two days later. After her troops exterminated the brigands, they looted the bodies and found the brooch, which was valuable, beautiful, and, as those wizards who were present soon discovered, conferred several useful magical abilities. It never occurred to Sabal that a treasure plundered from a dead dwarf might constitute a trap laid by a sister dark elf, and she happily laid claim to that portion of the spoils.\n From that day forward, Sabal slowly, subtly sickened in body, mind, and spirit, meanwhile struggling pathetically to hide any appearance of weakness from all who might discern it and decide to exploit it to kill her, torment her, or strip her of her rank. Which, ofcourse, was pretty much everyone in Menzoberranzan.\n Pharaun probably recognized her deterioration, but he was unable to arrest it. Perhaps he didn\u0027t even know she was constantly carrying an unusual new magical device about her person. The curse that was poisoning her, that lay insidiously threaded among all the benign enchantments, made her cling to the amulet with an obsessive fascination and fear that others would steal it if she didn\u0027t keep it hidden.\n During the several months of Sabal\u0027s malaise, Greyanna sometimes wondered if Pharaun would ally himself with her if asked again. She didn\u0027t. She just watched and waited for her chance to finish Sabal off. She\u0027d learned her lesson. No matter how unlikely the possibility seemed, she would not leave her twin alive to recoup her fortunes yet again.\n One night, Pharaun left the castle, either on some errand or simply because he was finding the situation inside oppressive. Later on, the suspicious, insomniac Sabal somehow slipped away from her guards and servants and began aimlessly wandering the citadel on her own.\n Greyanna and half a dozen of her minions confronted Sabal in the fungus garden, where the topiarist had trimmed the phosphorescent growths into fanciful shapes, fertilized in some cases with the ripe, diced\n remains of expired slaves. Sabal\u0027s final moments might have seemed pitiful, had Greyanna been susceptible to that crippling emotion. Her addled, desperate twin tried to use the platinum amulet against its maker, but Greyanna dispelled its powers with a thought. Then Sabal endeavored to cast a spell, but she couldn\u0027t recite the lines with the proper cadence or execute the gestures with the necessary precision.\n Laughing, Greyanna and the other waylayers closed in on their victim, and they didn\u0027t even have to strike a blow. Their mere proximity made Sabal wail, clutch at her heart, and fall over dead as a stone. Weak to the last.\n For a second, Greyanna felt a bit cheated, but she shook the feeling off. Sabal was dead, that was the main thing, and with a bit of luck, she would still have Pharaun to torture.\n Chanting words that sent a cold, charnel breeze moaning through the garden, she reanimated Sabal\u0027s corpse. She had use for it, first as a lure then as an instrument of humiliation. She hoped that before his extermination, her brother might be induced to spend one more tender interlude with it.\n When Pharaun returned to House Mizzrym an hour later, his hair and garments were as immaculate as ever, but he reeked of wine and walked with a slightly weaving and excessively careful tread. Evidently he\u0027d been drinking his troubles away. Perfect.\n As it had been instructed, the zombie stepped out of a doorway at the other end of the hall. Its arms were extended in a beseeching gesture.\n Pharaun took a few steps toward it and faltered. Drunk or not, he had finally noticed that, despite Greyanna\u0027s efforts to keep it warm, it was moving stiffly, awkwardly, as Sabal, even in the throes of her illness, never had. But he\u0027d spotted the anomaly too late. He\u0027d already advanced to the very center of the trap.\n Greyanna whispered a spell of paralysis. Pharaun staggered as his muscles all clenched at once. The fighters swarmed out of their hiding places, surrounded him, clubbed him repeatedly, and threw him down beneath them.\n She laughed with delight. Then her henchmen, more or less clumped in a pile on the floor, cried out in surprise and consternation. They started to stand up, and she saw that Pharaun did not lie crushed, bloody, and helpless on the floor beneath them. Impossible as it seemed, somehow he\u0027d resisted the paralysis, then used his wizardry to extricate himself from the midst of his attackers.\n Knowing that Sabal was dead, Pharaun must likewise assume that without the aegis of a high priestess he could no longer survive in House Mizzrym. Certainly he couldn\u0027t count on his vicious mother, who hadn\u0027t bestirred herself to save one daughter from another, to do more for a paltry son. He was surely running back toward the exit.\n \"That way! Fast!\" Greyanna shouted, pointing, goading her agents into motion.\n When they rounded a corner, they saw Pharaun sprinting along ahead of them, hispiwafwi billowing out behind him. He wasn\u0027t weaving or stumbling - evidently desperation had cured his intoxication - but he was clutching his head, and leaving a trail of bloody drops on the polished floor. Evidently all the bludgeoning had done at least a little good.\n Greyanna\u0027s minions shot their hand crossbows, but the darts bounced off the wizard\u0027s cloak, which had obviously been enchanted to serve as armor. She stopped running long enough to conjure a blaze of fire\n under Pharaun\u0027s feet. Her assassins cried out and shielded their eyes against the glare. Though surely burned, her brother stayed on his feet and kept going. The flames winked out behind him as suddenly as they\u0027d appeared.\n The chase rounded another corner. Ahead of Pharaun was an adamantine double door, which swung open seemingly of its own accord. In reality, Greyanna knew, the wizard had used his silver-and-jet Mizzrym House token to open it. She tried to use her own insignia to slam it shut again, but she was just out of range, Pharaun plunged through the exit. He was on the landing, a sort of balcony from which the occupants of the stalactite castle that was House Mizzrym could look down on the city. As was the custom, a company of guards stood watch there, and Greyanna screamed for them to stop the mage.\n They no doubt intended to be obey. She was a high priestess and he, a mere male, and manifestly trying to run away to boot. But alas, since their primary function was to look for miscreants trying toenter the castle, Pharaun had taken them by surprise. He had time to conjure some sort of hindering spell and dash on.\n When Greyanna made it to the door, she saw what manner of hindrance the fugitive had chosen. The guards were all bewildered, some standing stupefied or milling aimlessly, a couple fighting with each other.\n A clattering, followed a split second later by grunts and cries of pain, snapped her head around to the right. At the far end of the landing, a second contingent of sentries also looked at least temporarily incapacitated, these because Pharaun had pelted them with a conjured barrage of ice. He disappeared down the exit they\u0027d been guarding, the winding crystal staircase, gorgeous with magical luminescence, which connected House Mizzrym with the cave floor below.\n Greyanna felt a twinge of annoyance, but only that. Apparently she wasn\u0027t going to get a chance to torture Pharaun, but he was unquestionably going to die. He really had nowhere to run, and if the wretch weren\u0027t mired in a blind panic, he\u0027d know it.\n At least she could deliver the stroke that would seal his doom. She hurried to the edgeof the landing, saw that the blistered, bloody-headed fool was better than halfway down the radiant diamond steps, and pronounced, as quickly as possible, the long, awkward arcane word that would make the staircase vanish. That alone wouldn\u0027t kill him unless he lost his head. The ability to levitate granted by the same brooch that allowed him to pass through the House\u0027s doors would keep him from falling. Limited to strictly vertical movement, however, he ought to make an easy mark for spells and arrows.\n She spoke the final syllable. Just as the steps seemed to pop like a bubble, Pharaun leaped, his long legs making him look like a pair of scissors spread to the maximum possible width. He barely made it onto the flattened apex of the gigantic stalagmite that served as the stairs lower terminus.\n Greyanna was impressed. That jump was an impressive display of athleticism for a battered scholar of hedonistic habits. Not that it would do him any good. He really had run to the end of his race. She leaned out and shouted for the foulwings to kill him. Winded, still stumbling off-balance from hurdling across the empty space, Pharaun surely couldn\u0027t fend off both of them at once.\n Grotesque winged predators that commonly reeked of their caustic ammonia breath, the foulwings bespokethe Mizzryms power and magical prowess and lent the first step on the path to their citadel a certain style that mere soldiers could not match. They also made terrifying watchbeasts. With a snap of their clawed, batlike wings, in no wise hindered by their lack of legs, they spun their long-necked bodies around to loom over Pharaun. Forked snouts with fanged jaws at the end of either branch came questing\n hungrily down. From her perch, Greyanna looked on with a rapacity no less keen than theirs, albeit a rapacity of the soul.\n Pharaun shouted something. Greyanna couldn\u0027t quite make it out, but it didn\u0027t seem to be a magical word, just a cry of fear or a desperate plea for mercy - a plea the giant beasts would not heed.\n Except that they did. They hesitated, and he lifted his hands. Their deadly jaws played delicately about his fingers, taking in his scent.\n She cried again for the brutes to kill him. They twisted their heads around to look at her, but he spoke to them once more, and they ignored her command.\n Greyanna stared in amazement. Pharaun had no doubt had some limited contact with the foulwings, for after all, he lived in the same castle with them, but she knew he\u0027d never ridden one. Only the females of House Mizzrym enjoyed that privilege, and it was only by riding that you established genuine mastery over the creatures. How, then, could he possibly enjoy a rapport with them deeper than her own?\n Pharaun scrambled onto a foulwing\u0027s back, and both it and its fellow sprang into the air. Obviously her brother had managed to dissolve the enchantment that made the beasts want to sit contentedly at their post.\n The wizard managed his mount more deftly than Greyanna herself could have done without benefit of saddle, bridle, and goad. He shot her a mocking grin as he turned to flee. The other, riderless foulwing soared and swooped aimlessly, enjoying its liberty.\n Greyanna shook off her stunned disbelief. She still desperately wanted to know how Pharaun had learned to ride the creatures - probably Sabal had taught him, but how had they managed it without anyone else finding out? - but she wasn\u0027t going to stand there pondering the question. The answer was less important than the kill.\n She turned and looked around. Those guards whom Pharaun had addled were disoriented still, but some of the soldiers he\u0027d battered with hailstones appeared to have regained their composure.\n \"Shoot him!\" she shouted, pointing at the rapidly receding target. \"Shoot!\"\n With commendable haste, they obeyed. They took up their crossbows, aimed, and the bolts leaped forth m a ragged clatter.\n Pharaun\u0027s foulwing lurched, then plummeted down and down and down, crashing to earth somewhere amid the hollowed stalagmite edifices of the city.\n \"Got him,\" said the captain of the guard.\n Bigger and stronger than he, Greyanna had no difficulty knocking the male to the floor.\n \"You got the foulwing,\" she said. \"We don\u0027t know that you hit Pharaun at all. We don\u0027t know that he didn\u0027t use his wizardry or his levitation to cushion his fall. We don\u0027t know that he isn\u0027t down there alive and well laughing at us. I need to see his corpse, and one way or the other, you will fetch it for me. Turn out every available priestess, wizard, and warrior - drow or slave.Jump! \"\n Jump he did. It was the last bit of satisfaction that was to come her way.\n Her mortal agents flooded the streets, while she remained in her personal sanctum in House Mizzrym, summoning spirits and casting divinations to aid the search. Astonishingly, maddeningly, it was all to no avail. When light flowered in the base of Narbondel, signaling the advent of the new day, she was forced to admit that at least for the time being, Pharaun had eluded her.\n A month later, she learned that her brother had somehow made his way all the way up to Tier Breche and begged the Archmage of Menzoberranzan himself for a place in Sorcere, and, remembering the wizardly talent the younger male had demonstrated throughout his training, Gromph had seen fit to take him in.\n The news came as a considerable relief. She\u0027d feared her brother had fled Menzoberranzan and placed himself permanently beyond her reach. Instead, he\u0027d simply hopped up on a shelf above the city. He was bound to hop down again eventually, and she would have him.\n Or so she thought, until her mother sent for her. Possessed of the same intelligence concerning her fugitive son\u0027s whereabouts, Miz\u0027ri had formed a very different idea of what ought to be done about it: Nothing.\n Even though they were only males, the Masters of Sorcere possessed both a degree of practical autonomy and an abundance of mystical power, and, always weaving her labyrinthine schemes to elevate the status of House Mizzrym, Mother had decided not to unnecessarily provoke the wizards. Which was to say, as Pharaun had obtained a place in that cloistered, many-spired tower, he was more significant in exile than he had ever been at home, and Greyanna would have to let him live. She had achieved what ought to have been her primary goal, preeminence among her sisters and cousins, but her vengeance would remain unfinished.\n Through all the decades that followed, it galled her. A hundred times she planned to defy her mother\u0027s command and kill Pharaun anyway, only to abandon her stratagems just short of implementation. As fiercely as she hated him, she feared Miz\u0027ri\u0027s displeasure even more.\n Was it possible that at long last the matron mother had changed her mind? Or was this some new cruelty, was Miz\u0027ri perhaps going to somehow force Greyanna into an odious proximity with a brother who was still untouchable?\n \"It might be nice to see Pharaun again,\" the younger female said in the blandest tone she could muster.\n Miz\u0027ri laughed. \"Oh, I daresay it would, to see him and kill him, isn\u0027t that the way of it?\"\n \"If you say so. You know our history. We played out the wholesavagame under your nose.\" I imagine you relished every minute of it, she thought.\n \"Yes, you did, and so I know this will interest you. Sadly, a problem has arisen that even supercedes my desire to get along with the mages of the Academy. While you were away, males continued to desert - \"\n \"Pharaun ran off from Sorcere?\" Greyanna interrupted, her eyes narrowed. \"Were they finally going to punish him for getting those novices killed?\"\n \"No, and no! Shut your mouth, let me tell the tale, and we\u0027ll come to your little obsession in a moment.\"\n \"Yes, Mother.\"\n \"Males continue to elope, and despiteour warning him off, Gromph still intends to investigate the matter. Hoping to escape our notice and displeasure, he decided to do so by proxy, and summoned a suitable agent to his office to discuss the matter. Happily, we members of the Council possess a scrying crystal with which we recently managed to pierce the obscuring enchantments shrouding theroom. Some of them, anyway. We still can\u0027t see in, but we can hear what goes on, and that sufficed to reveal the archmage\u0027s plan as well as the identity of his minion. Now, if you must, you may excitedly babble your brother\u0027s name.\"\n \"I imagine Gromph told him this is his one big chance to redeem himself.\"\n \"Exactly. The question is, how shall we priestesses respond?\"\n \"I gather there\u0027s a reason you don\u0027t just tell Gromph you\u0027re on to his plan.\"\n \"Of course, several. For one, our first confrontation with him was courteous and rnild, but who knows, a second might be less so. As things stand, we hesitate to push him very hard. For another, we don\u0027t want him to know we can eavesdrop on him. He\u0027d either block us out or hatch his plots elsewhere. It\u0027s better all around simply to take his pawn out of play. Given that Pharaun is asecret operative, whatever may befall him, the archmage can hardly take exception to it. The catch being that dealing with your brother is a formidable undertaking, arguably on any occasion but certainly at the moment.\"\n Greyanna nodded. \"Because he\u0027s a wizard, and we are . . . what we are.\"\n \"So where, the Council wondered, can we find a priestess so bold, so motivated, that even now she\u0027ll be eager to hunt the male when he descends to the city. I told the others I thought I knew of a candidate.\"\n \"You were right.\"\n \"The beauty of it is that you do have a personal score to settle. If people see you do something unpleasant to Pharaun, they won\u0027t have to wonder what the reason is.\"\n \"Yes, I see that. May I draw on all the resources of our House to aid me in my efforts?\"\n \"I can only give you a few helpers. If people saw you descend on the city with House Mizzrym\u0027s entire army at your back, they wouldn\u0027t assume it\u0027s a personalmatter. You can have your pick of magic weapons from the armory. Don\u0027t waste them, though. Expend only what you need.\"\n Greyanna inclined her head. \"I\u0027ll start preparing right away.\"\n Miz\u0027ri finally smiled, and somehow, in defiance of any reasonable expectation, it made her face more threatening, not less. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dissolution-war-of-the-spider-queen-1/page-4.html","bookId":2159,"book":{"id":2159,"title":"Dissolution (War of the Spider Queen #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Dissolution (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
