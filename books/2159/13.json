{"id":97637,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"As Quenthel skulked down the corridor, it occurred to her that at the same time, Gromph was casting his radiant heat into the base of Narbondel. Even revelers and necromancers were settling in for a rest. She, however, was too busy to do the same. She wouldn\u0027t have a chance to relax until late the next night, unless, of course, she wound up resting forever. Fortunately, one of the Baenre alchemists brewed a stimulant to delay the onset of the aching eyes, fuzzy head, and leaden limbs that lack of rest produced. Quenthel extracted a silver vial of the stuff from one of the pouches on her belt and took a sip of it. She gasped, and her shoulder muscles jumped. Jolted back to alertness, she continued on her way. In another minute, she reached the door to Drisinil\u0027s quarters. In deference to the status of her family, the novice resided in one of Arach-Tinilith\u0027s most comfortable student habitations. Quenthel regretted not sticking her in a dank little hole. Perhaps then the girl would have learned her place. The high priestess inspected the arched limestone panel that was the door. She couldn\u0027t see any magical wards. \"Is it safe?\" she whispered to the vipers. \"We believe so,\" Yngoth replied. How reassuring, Quenthel thought, but it was either trust them or use another precious, irreplaceable scroll to wipe away protections that probably didn\u0027t exist. She activated the power of her brooch. When a novice came to Arach-Tinilith, the enchantments on certain doors were keyed to allow her to enter, based on the unique magical signature of her House insignia, rooms the high priestesses deemed it necessary for her to pass into. Only Quenthel\u0027s brooch could unlock them all. She unlocked Drisinil\u0027s door and warily cracked it open. No magic sparked, nor did any mechanical trap jab a blade at her. As quietly as she could, Quenthel crept on into the suite. Sensing her desire for quiet, the snakes hung mute and limp. She found Drisinil sitting motionless in a chair, her bandaged, mutilated hands in her lap. For a moment, Quenthel, thinking the other female must have a dauntless spirit to enter the Reverie at such a perilous time, rather admired her - then she caught the smell of brandy, and noticed the bottle lying in a puddle of liquor on the floor. Quenthel stalked toward the novice. It occurred to her that she was doing to Drisinil as the living darkness had done to her. The thought vaguely amused her, perhaps simply because she was finally the predator, not the prey. Smiling, she gently laid the vipers across the other drow\u0027s face and upper torso. The snakes hissed and writhed. Drisinil roused with a cry and a start. She started to rear up, and Quenthel pushed her back down in her chair. \"Sit!\" the Baenre snapped, \"or the serpents will bite.\" Her wide eyes framed by the cool, scaly loops of the vipers, Drisinil stopped struggling. \"Mistress, what\u0027s wrong?\" Quenthel smiled and said, \"Very good, child, you sound sincere. After your first ploy failed, you should at the very least have rested elsewhere.\" \"I don\u0027t know what you mean.\" Drisinil\u0027s hand shifted stealthily, no doubt toward a hidden weapon or charm. The vipers struck at the student\u0027s face, their fangs missing her sharp-nosed features by a fraction of an inch. She froze. \"Please,\" Quenthel said. \"This will go easier if you don\u0027t insult my intelligence. You have spirit, you believe I punished you too harshly, and you\u0027re Barrison Del\u0027Armgo, eager to bring down the one House standing between your family and supremacy. Of course you\u0027re involved in the plot against me. You\u0027re also an idiot if you didn\u0027t think I\u0027d realize it.\" \"Plot?\" Quenthel sighed. \"Halavin tried to kill me last night, and she didn\u0027t act alone. A single traitor couldn\u0027t have drugged all the food and drink set out at various points around the temple. It would have required abandoning her station for long enough that someone would have marked her absence.\" \"Halavin could have tainted the meal while it was still in the kitchen.\" \"She was never there.\" \"Then perhaps the demon poisoned the viands with its magic.\" \"No. As I\u0027m sure you noted, each spirit represents one ofthe facets of reality over which the goddess holds special dominion. Poison is the weapon of an assassin, while with its continually fluctuating form, last night\u0027s assailant was plainly a manifestation of chaos. \"The conspirators,\" Quenthel continued, \"had to contaminate each and every table because they didn\u0027t know where I would stop and eat. Many fell unconscious, but you and the other plotters knew not to sample the repast.\" Drisinil said, \"I had no part in it.\" \"Novice, you\u0027re beginning to irritate me. Admit your guilt, or I\u0027ll give you to the vipers and interrogate someone else.\" The serpents hissed and flicked their tongues. \"All right,\" said Drisinil, \"I was involved. A little. The others talked me into it. Don\u0027t kill me.\" \"I know what your little cabal has done, but I want to understand how youdared.\" Drisinil swallowed and said, \"You . . . you said it yourself. Each demon seeks to kill only you, and each in its own particular way reflects the divine majesty of Lolth. We thought she sent them. We thought we were doing what the goddess wanted.\" \"Because you\u0027re imbeciles. Has no one taught you to look beyond appearances? If Lolth wanted me dead, I couldn\u0027t survive her displeasure for a heartbeat, let alone three nights. The attacks resemble her doing because some blasphemous mortal arranged it so, to manipulate you into doing her killing for her. I\u0027d hoped you conspirators knew the trickster\u0027s identity, but I see it isn\u0027t so.\" \"No.\" \"Curse you all!\"Quenthel exploded. \"The goddess favorsme. How could you possibly doubt it? I\u0027m a Baenre, the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith, and I rose to the rank of high priestess more quickly that any Menzoberranyr ever has!\" \"I know . . .\" The novice hesitated, then said, \"The Mother of Lusts must have some reason for distancing herself from the city, and we . . . speculated.\" \"Some of you did, I\u0027m sure. Others simply liked the idea of eliminating me. I imagine your Aunt Molvayas would relish seeing me dead. She\u0027d have an excellent chance of becoming mistress in her turn. We Baenre don\u0027t have another princess seasoned enough to assume the role.\" \"Itwasmy aunt!\" Drisinil exclaimed. \"She came up with the idea of helping the demons kill you. I didn\u0027t even want to help. I thought it was a stupid idea, but within our family, she holds authority over me.\" Quenthel smiled. \"It\u0027s too bad you weren\u0027t more impressed with my authority.\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"No doubt that. Now, I need the names of all the conspirators.\" Drisinil didn\u0027t hesitate an instant. \"My aunt, Vlondril Tuin\u0027Tarl . . .\" As ever, Quenthel maintained a calm, knowing expression, but inwardly she was surprised at the number of conspirators. An eighth of the temple! It was unprecedented, but then she was living in unprecedented times. When Drisinil finished, the Baenre said, \"Thank you. Where did you gather to hatch your schemes?\" \"One of the unused storerooms in the fifth leg,\" Drisinil said. Quenthel shook her head. \"That won\u0027t do. It\u0027s not big enough. Convene the group in Lirdnolu\u0027s old classroom. Nobody\u0027s used it since she had her throat slit, so it will seem a safe meeting place.\" Drisinil blinked. \"Convene?\" \"Yes. Last night\u0027s plot failed, so obviously you must hatch a new one. You\u0027ve chosen a new chamber for the conference because you suspect the storeroom is no longer safe. Say whatever you need to say to assemble your cabal in four hours\u0027 time.\" \"If I do, will you spare me?\" \"Why not? As you\u0027ve explained, you only participated reluctantly. But you know, it suddenly occurs to me that we have a problem. If Isend you forth to perform this task, how do I know you won\u0027t simply flee Tier Breche and take refuge in your mother\u0027s castle?\" \"Mistress, you already explained that such a course could only lead to my death.\" \"But did you believe me? Do you still? How can I be sure?\" \"Mistress ... I ...\" \"If I had my magic, I could compel you to do as you\u0027re told, but in its absence, I must take other measures,\" Quenthel raised the whip, sweeping the vipers off Drisinil\u0027s face in the process, and slammed the metal butt of the weapon down in the middle of her forehead. The mistress then took out the silver vial. She pinched the dazed, feebly struggling girl\u0027s nostrils closed, poured the stimulant into her open mouth, and forced her to swallow. The effect was immediate. The younger female bucked and thrashed until her eyes flew open. The high priestess hopped back down to the floor. \"How does it feel? I imagine your heart is hammering.\" Drisinil trembled like the string of a viol. Sweat seeped from her pores. \"What did you do to me?\" \"That should be obvious to an accomplished poisoner like yourself.\" \"You\u0027ve poisoned me?\" \"It\u0027s a slow toxin. Do as I ordered, and I\u0027ll give you the antidote.\" \"I can\u0027t cozen the others like this. They\u0027ll see something\u0027s wrong with me.\" \"The external signs should ease in a minute or two, though you\u0027ll still feel the poison speeding your heart and gnawing at your nerves. You\u0027ll just have to put up with that.\" \"All right,\" Drisinil said. \"Just bring the antidote with you when you come to Lirdnolu\u0027s room.\" The mistress arched an eyebrow, and Drisinil added, \"Please.\" Quenthel smiled. Catching her mood, the whip vipers sighed with pleasure. \"How didyou know your darkness would madden the beast?\" asked Pharaun, lathering his narrow chest. The night before, after he made way back to Pharaun, the two of them had found they had enough healing potions to cure all the wounds that either had sustained. Still, despite their restoration to full vitality, the next few hours proved exhausting, as they struggled to survive the madness of the hunt and watch out for Greyanna at the same time. At last they\u0027d escaped the Braeryn. Claiming that while Greyanna was seeking them in the Stenchstreets, they\u0027d be safe in pleasant, prosperous Narbondellyn, Pharaun had insisted that he and Ryld dispense with disguises and celebrate their sundry discoveries and escapes with a visit to one of Menzoberranzan\u0027s finest public baths. The warrior had objected to what he saw as reckless bravado, but not too vehemently. Ryld supposed that he and Pharaun would climb beyond their foes\u0027 reach soon enough. The prospect made him feel rather wistful. Over the course of the past few minutes, he\u0027d been enjoying the luxury of scrubbing off the sweat and grime that had accumulated on his person, sitting down, and thinking about nothing in particular. He should have known the peace and quiet couldn\u0027t last for long. Pharaun couldn\u0027t go long without craving conversation. \"How did you know that, shrouded in darkness or no, the foul wing wouldn\u0027t just keep descending, guided by its other senses?\" the wizard persisted. The warrior shrugged and said, \"I didn\u0027t know, but it seemed like a good guess. The thing\u0027s an animal, isn\u0027t it?\" Pharaun grinned. \"Not really. It\u0027s a creature from another plane. Still, your instincts were sound.\" Ryld shrugged and replied, \"I was lucky to get away from there with my life. Very lucky.\" \"Fire and glare, you\u0027re a master of Tier Breche. You\u0027re not supposed to be modest. Are you ready to move?\" They rose from an octagonal pool set in the black marble floor, and, having completed the quotidian business of cleaning themselves, headed for a larger basin where they would luxuriate in steaming, scented mineral water. Later in the day, it would be packed, but it wasn\u0027t fashionable to visit the baths so early in the morning. They had it to themselves, which was convenient. They could converse without fear of eavesdroppers. Ryld walked straight down the steps and sat on the underwater ledge. The warmth felt good on his leg, mended but still a little sore, and he sighed with contentment. Pharaun made a production of immersing himself in stages, an inch at a time, as if the heat were almost more than he could bear. \"I\u0027ve been thinking about your malaise,\" the wizard said, once everything but his head was finally submerged. \"I have a solution.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Resign from Melee-Magthere and become the weapons master of a noble House. It will have to be one of the lesser ones, of course, you being a commoner, but that\u0027s all right. You may see more excitement that way.\" \"Why would I do that? It\u0027s not a move up. It might not be a loss of rank, depending on the House, but still, what would be the point?\" \"You\u0027re bored, and it would be a change.\" \"One that would put me under the thumb of any number of high priestesses. I\u0027d have less autonomy than I do as an instructor.\" \"I managed to pursue my own objectives while under my mother\u0027s supervision. Still, you make a legitimate point. You might find yourself abhorring the tug of the reins. What\u0027s the answer, then?\" \"Who says there is one? Except, perhaps, further lunatic holidays with you. I admit, this one broke the tedium.\" A diminutive female gnome carried a pile of freshly laundered and folded towels out of a doorway on the far wall. Ryld wondered if she was one of the Prophet\u0027s followers, and if she had any of the rabble-rouser\u0027s duergar firepots stashed somewhere in the bathhouse. It felt strange to think of a humble undercreature that way - wielding stone-burning bombs against its betters. \"You speak of our errand in the past tense,\" the wizard said. \"Well, once you tell the archmage the runaways are in the Braeryn fomenting a pitiful little goblin uprising, it\u0027ll be over, won\u0027t it? Gromph will pardon your transgressions. The Council, having failed to stop our inquiries, will, I trust, see no point in continuing to try to kill us. It\u0027ll be more to their advantage to let us go on training wizards and soldiers to serve them.\" \"You\u0027re very certain the insurrection will be pitiful. Is it because Greyanna\u0027s followers exterminated so many undercreatures last night?\" Ryld scooped upa handful of hot water and splashed it on his neck, which had gotten a little stiff from his exertions. \"No,\" he said. \"The hunters killed plenty of goblins, but they were only a fraction of a fraction of the creatures jammed into every nook and cranny of the district - you saw the interior of Smylla\u0027s home. Trust me, you still don\u0027t really understand.\" \"I understand that many other such specimens inhabit the rest of the city as well. Why, then, do you doubt their ability to do some appreciable damage? It can\u0027t be for want of spirit. The underfolk are in an excellent humor, enflamed by their Prophet\u0027s oratory, painting their racial emblems hither and yon, and murdering potential informers and unbelievers.\" \"They still lack martial training and proper weapons.\" \"Some were warriors before the slavers captured them. Some are thrall soldiers still. As for the arms, well, when visiting the World Above, did you ever see a city burn? I did. I had to torch one myself to complete a mission. The destruction and loss of life were impressive, even though the inhabitants knew their buildings could catch fire and had procedures for dealing with it.\" \"Whereas we don\u0027t? Surely you wizards . . . ?\" Pharaun shrugged. \"Not really. Why would it occur to us? Perhaps we could improvise something, but if we didn\u0027t catch the conflagration early, it might not be entirely effective.\" \"But you would catch it early. The undercreatures won\u0027t rebel all at once, and that will make it possible to quash each little uprising as it begins.\" \"You\u0027re assuming \u0027the Call,\u0027 whatever it is, will pass by word of mouth, or at any rate, that it won\u0027t be disseminated rapidly. You could be right. The noise baffles may hinder it, but what if the Prophet has some arcane means of rousing every goblin and bugbear at the exact same instant?\" \"Do you know of such a magic?\" \"No.\" \"And you\u0027re a Master of Sorcere. So it\u0027s reasonable to assume no such power exists.\" Pharaun arched an eyebrow. \"Indeed? Thank you for your expert opinion.\" Ryld made a spitting sound and said, \"Look. You think a rebellion could amount to something. I disagree, but say you\u0027re right. Isn\u0027t that all the more reason to report to Gromph immediately?\" The wizard waved to a goblin slave who was sauntering by. \"The difficulty is that I have yet to succeed.\" \"What?\" \"My assignment is to find the runaways. I glimpsed two of them for a matter of minutes, then lost them. Do you think the Baenre will deem that satisfactory?\" Frowning, Ryld said, \"Considering that we did uncover something of interest. . .\" \"Remember, our great and glorious archmage doesn\u0027t hold me in high esteem. He sent me out as a decoy, a target for the priestesses to harass. Knowing him as I do, I\u0027m sure that if I fulfill the letter of our agreement, he\u0027ll swallow his dislike and keep his end, but should I fall the least bit short, it will be a different matter.\" \"You can at least tell him the rogues are in the Braeryn.\" \"Can I? We sifted through the Stenchstreets as well as any outsiders could. We didn\u0027t find the house where the runaways hang their cloaks, and we actually have only the flimsiest of reasons for assuming it\u0027s in the Braeryn at all.\" \"I suppose you\u0027re right.\" \"Of course. When am I not? Now, here\u0027s what I intend to do: Find the rogues\u0027 hiding place. Discover who the Prophet is and how his wizardry - or whatever it is - works. Learn where the firepots came from, where they\u0027re cached around the city, and the master plan for the rebellion. And most importantly of all, determine what the fugitives know about the clergy losing its magic.\" \"In hopes of coming out of this affair more powerful than you ever were before.\" Pharaun grinned. \"More powerful thanwe ever were before. That might dispel your boredom for good and all.\" \"And those are the real reasons you aren\u0027t ready to go back to Tier Breche.\" \"All my motives are genuine, including my wariness of Gromph. I take it youarein a frantic hurry to return?\" Ryld sighed. \"I\u0027m in no rush. Our excursion has been interesting, and I like to finish what I start, but what if the orcs rebel before we get around to warning our fellow drow?\" \"Then we\u0027ll make sure never to tell anyone we knew it was coming.\" The wizard grinned and added, \"Actually, the awareness that we race to avert a calamity will make our exploits all the more stimulating.\" \"And should we lose the race, maybe the rebellion won\u0027t kill anyone who matters to the two of us. I suppose I agree. We\u0027ll keep on searching.\" \"Excellent!\" Bearing a silver tray, the goblin bustled to the side of the pool. Bending the knees of his splayed, bristly legs, he brought the salver low enough for the dark elves to take the goblets on top of it. Pharaun gave the thrall a smile anda wave, dismissing him, then lifted his cup. \"To mystery and glory!\" Ryld sipped from his own cup, acknowledging the toast. The drink was red morel juice, sweet and very cold, a pleasant contrast to the heat of the water. \"So I guess it\u0027s back to looking like orcs,\" said the weapons master. \"I grieve to disappoint you, but the time for that sort of deception has passed.\" \"What do you mean? If we don\u0027t look like undercreatures, how are we going to get into another one of those secret meetings?\" \"We don\u0027t know that the Prophet will hold another assembly. He\u0027s already explained his strategy and distributed his secret weapon. Even if he does, it might not be for several days, during which we\u0027ll have Greyanna seeking us relentlessly. We\u0027ve evaded her so far, but we must acknowledge the possibility that our luck could sour eventually.\" \"You\u0027re right about that.\" \"Therefore, we need to find the rogues quickly, which means a change of tactics is in order. Why are the boys trying to instigate a goblin revolt?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Nor do I, really. It doesn\u0027t appear to make sense. Still, would you agree that the intent, like the act of eloping itself, reflects an antipathy to the established order?\" \"Possibly.\" \"Then let\u0027s assume the Prophet or some other ringleader lured the males away from their homes because he knew they were more than ordinarily resentful of their places in the world.\" \"It\u0027s possible. Where does the notion lead?\" The wizard grinned and said, \"If we demonstrate that we share their distemper, the rogues may recruit us as well.\" \"How can we do that? We may not be clerics, but we\u0027re Masters of the Academy. We\u0027re pillars of the hierarchy, and more to the point, we have a pleasanter lot and thus less reason for discontent than most.\" \"That doesn\u0027t seem to slow you down.\" \"Even so.\" \"Here\u0027s what you\u0027re overlooking. Thanks to my misadventure with the Sarthos demon, I\u0027m adisgraced master, likely in line for some ghastly punishment. Whereas you with your dour demeanor and dwarven armor are clearly an iconoclast and malcontent. Moreover, we\u0027ve been asking everywhere for news of the runaways. They must know of it, even though they didn\u0027t see fit to make contact. During that same time, a high priestess from House Mizzrym has tried to murder us. They surely have some cognizance of that as well.\" \"Yet they still didn\u0027t approach us. Why would they do it now?\" Pharaun smiled. \"Because we\u0027ll provide proof that we do in fact share their perspective.\" \"How?\" \"The priestesses lead regular patrols through the Bazaar. We\u0027ll destroy one, repair to the Braeryn, boast of the deed, and await developments. The rogues will seek us out. How can they not? Whatever their ultimate objective, I\u0027m sure they can use the services of two such talented fellows.\" \"No doubt, but back up. You want to murder a patrol?\" \"In as showy a manner as possible. With a bit of planning, it should be easy enough. They won\u0027t be as numerous as Greyanna\u0027s hunters and they won\u0027t be expecting that sort of trouble.\" \"What happened to not killing anybody, especially clerics, unless we absolutely have to?\" \"We do absolutely have to. We\u0027re in a race against time, remember, and this is the speediest route to our objective.\" \"Maybe, but what happens afterward? Won\u0027t any number of folk want to punish us for our impudence?\" \"We won\u0027t confide our involvement to those likely to prove unsympathetic.\" \"The priestesses will figure it out.\" \"Ah, but snug and safe in the lair of our friend the Prophet, we won\u0027t care. Besides, the Council has already authorized our annihilation, so we really have nothing to lose.\" \"Perhaps the crime can\u0027t worsen our current situation, but what about the long term?\" \"In the long term,\" Pharaun said, \"it won\u0027t matter. As you yourself observed mere moments ago, we Menzoberranyr are a pragmatic lot. People forgive whatever outrages I committed yesterday if I make myself useful today.\" \"Greyanna didn\u0027t.\" The wizard laughed and replied, \"Well, of course, we\u0027re likewise prone to grudges, vendettas, and blood feuds. It\u0027s one of the paradoxes central to our natures. With luck, though, no one of importance will take our little massacre personally, I doubt we\u0027ll be murdering any princesses, or anyone of genuine significance to her family.\" \"I think it\u0027s crazy,\" Ryld said, shaking his head. \"You don\u0027t know that the rogues will contact us, or if they\u0027ll like what they see if they do.\" \"Then we\u0027ll simply hatch another scheme.\" Ryld scowled and shook his head again. \"You\u0027re mad,\" the weapons master said, \"but I\u0027m with you.\" \"Splendid! We must toast our homicidal designs with something stronger than juice.\" Pharaun looked about and spotted the goblin. \"May we see the wine list, please?\" Ryld said, \"It\u0027s the very beginning of the morning.\" \"Don\u0027t be misled by superficial appearances,\" Pharaun replied. \"As neither of us has enjoyed a moment of repose, it must still be night. Do you think they have any of that \u002753 Barrison Del\u0027Armgo heartwine?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dissolution-war-of-the-spider-queen-1/page-13.html","bookId":2159,"book":{"id":2159,"title":"Dissolution (War of the Spider Queen #1)","description":"Storyline: Dissolution (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
