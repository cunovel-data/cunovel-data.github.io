{"id":97632,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"For an instant, the world blazed bright and hot, searing Pharaun\u0027s skin. However, when the flame was gone it left little more than a tactile memory of pain. Gasping, the wizard took stock of himself. Except for a blister or two, he was all right. Some combination of the protective enchantments woven into both his vest andpiwafwi, his innate drow resistance to hostile magic, and the silver ring he wore bearing the insignia of Sorcere, had saved him from fatal burns.\\n\\n Ryld had drawn Splitter. An arrow whizzed down from a rooftop across the street, and the burly swordsman batted it out of the air. A huge flying mount wheeled overhead, vanishing from view before Pharaun could get a good look at it.\\n\\n \"Are you all right?\" Ryld asked.\\n\\n \"Just singed a little,\" Pharaun replied.\\n\\n \"Here are your rogues, not so canny after all. We\u0027ll either have to rise into the air after them or pull them down to the street.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll do neither. Follow me.\"\\n\\n \"Run?\" the weapons master asked, swatting away another arrow. \"I thought we wanted to catch one of them.\"\\n\\n \"Just follow.\"\\n\\n Pharaun began moving down the street, meanwhile peering upward, looking for his attackers. Ryld scowled but trailed along behind him.\\n\\n The Master of Sorcere glimpsed a swirling motion from the corner of his eye. He pivoted. Crouched on the edge of a roof, a spellcaster spun his hands in fluid mystic passes.\\n\\n Gesturing, speaking rapidly, Pharaun rattled off his own incantation. He was racing the other mage, and he finished his magic first. Five darts of azure light leaped from his fingertips, shot at the spellcaster, and plunged into his chest. From that distance, he couldn\u0027t tell how badly he\u0027d hurt his colleague, but at the least his foe flailed his arms m pain. The Academician\u0027s attack had disrupted his spell.\\n\\n Ryld knocked another arrow away, and only then did Pharaun realize that this time, the shaft had been hurtling at him. An instant later, a studded mace seemingly made of shadow flew out of nowhere and swung itself at his head. Splitter flicked over and tapped that manifestation. As conjured objects often did, the war club vanished at the greatsword\u0027s touch.\\n\\n \"In here,\" Pharaun said.\\n\\n The two masters ran to the arched sandstone door of one of the modest houses on the street. Pharaun suspected that the tenants had locked it at the first sign of trouble, and evidently Ryld agreed, because he didn\u0027t bother trying the handle. He simply booted the door and broke the latch. The weapons master scrambled inside.\\n\\n The front room of the home was crowded. Pharaun might have expected that. The population of the city had grown considerably since its founding but the number of stalagmite buildings was of necessity fixed. The poor had to squeeze in wherever they could.\\n\\n Thus, an abundance of paupers lived in the hovel, and a goodly number of them had gathered in this common space, either to relax or to dip rothe stew from the iron caldron on the trestle table. Surprisingly, the simple meal actually smelled appetizing. The aroma made Pharaun\u0027s mouth water and reminded him that he hadn\u0027t dined in several hours.\\n\\n Ryld brandished Splitter at the occupants of the house with a flashy facility calculated to quell aggressive impulses.\\n\\n \"We apologize for the intrusion,\" Pharaun said.\\n\\n The weapons master glowered at him.\"Why are we running?\"\\n\\n \"That pillar of fire was divine magic, not arcane.\" Pharaun lifted his hand, displaying the silver Sorcere ring and reminding his friend of its power to identify, not just protect him from, magic. \"It\u0027s priestesses attacking us. Killing them would call attention to us, make the Council even more eager to put a stop to our inquiry. It might even make them want to kill us irrespective of how our mission turns out or of what Gromph decides.\"\\n\\n Pharaun grinned and added, \"I know I promised you glorious mayhem, but that will have to wait.\"\\n\\n Ryld replied, \"It\u0027s a difficult thing to sneak away from foes who hold the high ground.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m an inexhaustible font of tricks, haven\u0027t you noticed?\" Pharaun beamed at the assembled paupers and said, \"How would you all like to assist two masters of the Academy engaged in a mission of vital importance? I assure you, Archmage Baenre himself will wax giddy with gratitude when I inform him of your aid.\"\\n\\n His audience stared back at him, fear in their eyes. One of the female commoners produced a bone-handled, granite-headed mallet and threw it. Ryld caught it and hurled it back. The makeshift weapon thudded into the center of the laborer\u0027s forehead, and she collapsed.\\n\\n \"Would anyone else care to express a reservation of any sort?\" Pharaun asked. He waited a beat. \"Splendid, then just stand still. I assure you, this won\u0027t hurt.\"\\n\\n The Master of Sorcere pulled a wisp of fleece from a pocket and recited an incantation. With a soft hissing, a wave of magical force shimmered through the room. When it touched the paupers, they changed, each into a facsimile of Ryld or Pharaun himself. Only a single child remained unaffected.\\n\\n \"Excellent,\" said Pharaun. \"Now all you have to do is go outside, at which point, I recommend you scatter. With luck, many, if not all of you, will survive.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" cried one of Ryld\u0027s doubles in a high, agitated voice. \"You can\u0027t make us - \"\\n\\n \"But we can,\" said Pharaun. \"I can fill the house with a poisonous vapor, my friend can start chopping you to pieces. ... So please, be sensible, go now. If the enemy breaks in here, your chances will be significantly worse.\"\\n\\n They looked sullenly back at him. He smiled and shrugged, and Ryld hefted Splitter. The commoners began to scurry toward the door.\\n\\n The two masters fell in at the back of the crowd, prepared to chivvy folk along as necessary.\\n\\n \"Shadows of the Pit,\" murmured Pharaun, \"I wasn\u0027t at all sure they would actually do it. I am a persuasive devil, aren\u0027t I? It must be my honest face.\"\\n\\n \"Decoys aren\u0027t a bad idea,\" said Ryld, \"but now that I think of it, why not just turn us invisible?\"\\n\\n Pharaun snorted. \"Do I tell you which end of the sword to grip? Invisibility\u0027s too common a trick. I\u0027m sure our foes are prepared to counter it. Whereas the illusion may work. It\u0027s one of my personal, private spells, and we Mizzrym are famously deft with phantasmata. Now, when we get outside, don\u0027t lose track of me. You don\u0027t want to go skipping off with the wrong Pharaun.\"\\n\\n Most of the commoners had vacated the house. Pharaun drew a deep breath, steadying himself, and he and Ryld plunged out into the open.\\n\\n The commoners were scattering as directed. As far as Pharaun could tell, no one had attacked any of them. Perhaps, as he\u0027d hoped, the enemy was entirely flummoxed.\\n\\n The masters, fleeing like the rest, turned one corner and another. Pharaun was beginning to feel the smugness that comes from outwitting an adversary when something rattled and rustled above his head. He looked up in time for it to slam him in the face and knock him down. Dropped from a fair height, the thick, coarse strands of rope comprising the net struck with the force of a club.\\n\\n Also trapped, Ryld cursed, the language vulgar enough tomake the Braeryn proud.\\n\\n Pharaun needed a second to shake off the shock of the impact, and he realized his current situation was even more unfortunate than he\u0027d initially thought. The net, woven in a spiderweb pattern, was animate. Scraping his skin, striving to render him completely immobile, the heavy mesh shifted and tightened around him.\\n\\n A foulwing landed on the street. In the saddle sat an otherwise handsome priestess with a scarred face - a Mizzrym face, lean, intelligent, and sardonic. Strangely, she wore a domino mask, and Pharaun suspected he knew why.\\n\\n Grinning, the female said, \"I knew you\u0027d try to trick me with illusions, Pharaun. That\u0027s why I brought a talisman of true seeing.\"\\n\\n Though he wasn\u0027t sure she could see itfrom outside the net, Pharaun made it a point to smile back when he said, \"And you were correct. Hello, Greyanna.\"\\n\\n Quenthel was immune to fear. She did not, could not, panic. Or so she had always believed, and in fact, she wasn\u0027t panicking, but she was as desperate and bewildered as any ill-wisher could desire.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t certain, but she believed the vipers\u0027 hissing and a bump and clatter had roused her from her trancelike state of repose. She\u0027d opened her eyes and seen nothing. Evidently someone had conjured a patch of darkness around her, or worse, cursed her with a blindness spell. She opened her mouth to speak to the whip snakes, and something cold and thick jammed itself inside.\\n\\n Her throat clogged, she was suffocating. Meanwhile, something else, something that felt like the cool, dexterous tip of a demon\u0027s tentacle, slid around her wrist.\\n\\n She yanked her hand away just before the unseen member could lock around it and thrashed to keep her limbs free of the other tendrils that began to grope after them. None of it helped her breathe.\\n\\n She battered furiously at the space around her. Logic told her that her attacker had to be there, but her fists merely swept through empty space. Her chest ached with the need for air, and she felt unconsciousness nibbling at her mind.\\n\\n She did the only thing left. She bit down.\\n\\n At first, she couldn\u0027t penetrate the mass, but she strained, snarled in her throat with effort, and her teeth sank into something leathery and oily.\\n\\n In an instant, it vanished. It didn\u0027t yank itself free, it just melted away.\\n\\n Quenthel\u0027s teeth snapped together with a clack.\\n\\n Scrambling to her knees, she sucked in a couple deep breaths, then called, \"Whip!\"\\n\\n \"Here!\" Yngoth cried from somewhere on the floor. \"We didn\u0027t see the demon until the last second. Itis the darkness!\"\\n\\n \"I understand.\"\\n\\n At least she wasn\u0027t blind. She\u0027d heard of demons made of darkness itself, though she had never had occasion to summon one. They were said to be hard to catch and even harder to bind.\\n\\n \"Guard!\" she called.\\n\\n This time she didn\u0027t hear an answer and wasn\u0027t surprised. The invader\u0027s presence suggested the sentry was either a traitor or dead.\\n\\n Quenthel sensed something rushing at her. She flung herself sideways, and something crashed against the patch of wall immediately behind the space she\u0027d just vacated. The stone floor chilled her through her gauzy wisp of a chemise.\\n\\n As planned, she fetched up against the stand where she kept certain small pieces of her regalia. She leaped up and groped about the rectangular stone tabletop. To her disgust, a couple items rattled to the floor, but then her fingers closed on a medallion of beautifully cut glass.\\n\\n Squinting, she invoked the trinket\u0027s power. A dazzling glare blazed through the room. Quenthel had to shield her own eyes, hoping the terrible light would destroy a living darkness altogether.\\n\\n The magic light and the equally supernatural darkness made for a split second when the lighting in the room was as it was before the creature had entered. At least Quenthel could open her eyes.\\n\\n Her assailant, seemingly unaffected by the light, was a ragged central blot with long, tattered arms snaking throughout the room, ubiquitous as smoke. Drinking in all the glow, reflecting none, it was dead black and deceptively flat-looking. It thrust a long, thin probe at the medallion and Quenthel jerked the token aside. The shaft of blackness veered, compensating, and struck the medallion hard enough to knock it out of her hand. The light died instantly when the glass medallion shattered on the floor.\\n\\n Fortunately, the illumination had lasted long enough for her to note the locations ofseveral other objects on the stand. She instinctively ducked, the tentacle swept over her head and tousled her hair, and she grabbed a scroll. As before, she would regret expending any of the spells contained therein - but she\u0027d regret dying even more.\\n\\n Conversant with the contents of the parchment, she didn\u0027t need to see the trigger phrase to \"read\" it. She recited the words, and a shaft of yellow flame roared down from the ceiling through the spot where the core of the demon had been floating. The firelight showed that it was still there. The blaze passed right through it, and all its arms and streamers of murk convulsed.\\n\\n The column of flame vanished after a moment, leaving, despite the care the drow had taken to shield her eyes, a haze of afterimage bisecting her vision. It took her a second to realize that dull, wavering stripe was the only thing she could see. The darkness had survived. It had clotted its essence around her to seal her eyes once more.\\n\\n You\u0027re a tough one,she thought, sending the unspoken words to the mind of the demon as she, a divine emissary of Lolth, was trained to do.\\n\\n There was no response, and Quenthel felt no connection made between her mind and the consciousness of the demon. This was no servant of Lolth\u0027s.\\n\\n Alive and impossible to command, it would surely grab or strike at her, and this time intuition was failing her. She had no idea from where the attack would come, so she didn\u0027t know which way to dodge to evade it. She simply had to guess, jump somewhere and not let blindness and indecision delay her. She pivoted, and something struck her shoulder.\\n\\n At first it was just a startling jolt, then pain burned at the point of impact, and wet blood flowed. Either the darkness could harden its members into claws or else it had picked up a blade from somewhere in the chamber.\\n\\n Quenthel was glad her teachers had taught her to suffer a wound without the shock of it freezing her in her tracks, helpless to avert her adversary\u0027s follow-up attack. She kept moving, making herself, she hoped, a more difficult target.\\n\\n Something hissed. The source of the sound was almost under her feet. Evidently, dragging the whip handle behind them, her vipers had been slithering about endeavoring to locate her in the dark. She stooped, fumbled about their cool, sinuous lengths for a moment, achieved the proper grip, and lifted the weapon.\\n\\n The serpents reared, hissed, and peered, each in a different direction. Quenthel realized they could see\\n\\n what she could not. The darkness was preparing toattack.\\n\\n The priestess deepened her psionic link with her snake-demon servants. She still couldn\u0027t see where her adversary\u0027s tentacles were poised, but she had a sense of them. That would have to do.\\n\\n The darkness reached for her, and, turning and turning, she swung the whip repeatedly. Her aim was inexact, but the vipers twisted in the air to correct it.\\n\\n Toward the end, she was breathing harder, and her actions were getting bigger, slower, and wilder, as any combatant\u0027s will if she performs too many without a pause. Then something long and pointed plunged into the back of her thigh.\\n\\n Quenthel knew at once from the flare of pain and the gush of blood that this puncture wound was worse than the gash in her shoulder. She staggered a step, and her leg began to fold. The whip vipers hissed in alarm.\\n\\n She shouted to focus her will and quell the agony, to force the limb to obey. Throbbing, it straightened.\\n\\n She spun and struck at the tentacle that had stabbed her, lashing it to pieces before it could do the same again. At that same instant, her serpent familiars detected hands reaching for her neck. She spun, destroyed those as well, and at last the shadow stopped attacking.\\n\\n Feeling the blood stream down herleg to pool on the floor, her mind racing, Quenthel considered her situation. She must be causing the demon pain - if not it would attack relentlessly, never faltering until she fell - but that didn\u0027t necessarily mean she was well on her way tokilling it. From what she knew of such entities, it seemed entirely possible that she would have to do more harm to the nucleus at the end of the tendrils to accomplish that. Assuming she could reach or even locate it amid the obfuscating gloom.\\n\\n It might be better not to try, to take advantage of this momentary respite and make a run for it, but she knew that if she moved the demon would move with her, which would mean she\u0027d still be scurrying sightlessly along. In her suite, that wasn\u0027t an enormous problem - she knew every inch of the space by heart - but outside, she could easily take a hard, incapacitating fall. If that happened or if her leg gave out before she found help, her foe would have little difficulty finishing her off.\\n\\n No, she would kill the cursed thing by herself, quickly, while she was still on her feet. The only question was, how?\\n\\n One of the weapons in her hidden closet might do the trick, but she had no way of reaching them. The demon would slay her while she fumbled in the dark to manipulate the hidden lock. She would have to make do with the resources in her hands, which meant using another scroll spell and taking a gamble as well.\\n\\n The demon renewed the attack. Quenthel struck and deflected a tentacle with sawlike teeth on the edge. Next came an arm terminating in a studded bulb like the head of a mace. Poised to beat her skull in, that one was no use either. She sidestepped the blow, the vipers tore into the limb, and the living darkness snatched it back.\\n\\n A simple tentacle, with no blades or bludgeons sprouting from its end, snaked toward her. It seemed as if it was going to try to grab and restrain her weapon arm. She pretended she didn\u0027t notice.\\n\\n The strand of shadow dipped to the floor, hooked around Quenthel\u0027s ankle, and jerked her good leg out\\n\\n from under her. The change of target caught her by surprise, and she fell hard on her back, banging her head and shooting pain through her wounded limbs.\\n\\n It took her an instant to shake off the shock. When she did, she sensed the fiend\u0027s other limbs poised to slash and pound. She was almost out of time to recite the trigger phrase.\\n\\n But not quite.\\n\\n She rattled off the three words, and power seethed and tingled inside her flesh. She discharged it into the living darkness, an easy task since the demon was holding onto her. She held her breath, waiting to see what would happen.\\n\\n Like allowing her adversary to seize her, this too was a part of the gamble. The magic she had just unleashed would weaken a dark elf or pretty much any other mortal being to the point of death. However, depending on its precise nature, the demon - or whatever it was - might simply shrug it off. It might even feed on the blast of force and grow stronger than before.\\n\\n The ploy worked. The fiend was susceptible, at least to some degree. She knew it when the entity\u0027s limbs flailed and thrashed in spasms, the one on her ankle releasing her to twist and flop about. The ambient darkness blinked out of existence for a second as the creature\u0027s grip on its surroundings wavered.\\n\\n One instant of vision was all Quenthel needed to mark where her enemy\u0027s ragged core was floating. She scrambled up, charged it, and found that she was hobbling, every other stride triggering a jolt of pain. She didn\u0027t let the discomfort slow her down.\\n\\n The creature of darkness was recovering. Two tendrils squirmed at Quenthel. She ducked one and lashed the other, which flinched back.\\n\\n After two more steps, she judged, hoped, that she\u0027d limped within striking distance of the entity\u0027s formless heart. She swung the whip, and shouted in satisfaction when she felt the vipers\u0027 fangs rip something more resistant than empty air.\\n\\n She struck as hard and as fast as she could, grunting with every stroke. Her snakes warned her of tendrils looping around behind her, and she ignored the threat. If she left off attacking the center of the darkness, she might not get another chance.\\n\\n The darkness obscuring the room started rapidly oscillating between presence and absence. Quenthel\u0027s motions looked oddly jerky in the disjointed moments of vision.\\n\\n Tentacles grabbed and dragged her backward. She shouted in rage and frustration. As if responding to her cry, the arms dissolved, dumping her back on the floor.\\n\\n Quenthel raised her head and peered about. There was no longer any impediment to sight. The murderous darkness was gone. Her last blow must have been mortal. It had just taken the creature another second or two to succumb.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s dead!\" hissed Hsiv. \"What now, Mistress?\"\\n\\n \"First . . . I\u0027m going to sit ... and tend my wounds, then we\u0027re going to look . . . for my sentry,\" panted Quenthel, attenuating her rapport with the vipers. In too deep and prolonged a communion, shades of identity could bleed in one direction or the other. \"If she\u0027s lucky, she\u0027s already dead.\"\\n\\n She wished she were as undaunted as she was trying to sound, but it appeared that demonic assassins were going to keep coming for her. She\u0027d hoped that the appearance of the spider demon might be an isolated incident. She\u0027d thought that if any more such fiends did appear, the renewed wards would keep them out. Plainly, she\u0027d been too optimistic.\\n\\n At least Arach-Tinilith was the seat of her power. There, she could deploy a small army of retainers and a hoard of magical devices in her own defense, but those resources hadn\u0027t helped her against the darkness, and she couldn\u0027t help wondering how many hostile visitations a priestess in her condition could hope to survive. EIGHT\\n\\n Greyanna\u0027s henchmen came floating down around her. Two were warriors, one a wizard, and the third was another priestess. All wore the half masks of true seeing, giving them the deceptively foolish look of actors in a pantomime.\\n\\n Pharaun tried to levitate, but the net was too heavy. He willed his animate rapier into existence. The steel ring vanished from his finger, and the long, slim sword materialized outside the net. The blade started slicing at the thick ropes, but to little effect. A rapier was a thrusting weapon and not suited to sawing. Tensing his muscles against the remorseless pressure of the tightening web, he turned the floating sword around to threaten his fellow representatives of House Mizzrym.\\n\\n Greyanna laughed. \"Is that one little bodkin supposed to hold us all at bay?\"\\n\\n \"Possibly not,\" said Pharaun, straining to work his fingers closer to one of his pockets. \"That\u0027s why I instructed it to kill you first.\"\\n\\n \"Did you, now?\"\\n\\n His sister motioned her warriors forward. Twin brothers possessed of the same slightly yellowish hair and deeply cleft chin, they carried pale bone longbows slung over their backs in preference to the more common crossbows.\\n\\n Greyanna herself remained on her mount and produced a scroll from within herpiwafwi.Thanks to his remaining ring, Pharaun could see from the complex corona of magical force shining around the rolled parchment that it contained, among others, a spell to disrupt the other fellow\u0027s magic. Perhaps she intended to use it to render the dancing rapier inert long enough for her minions to break or immobilize it.\\n\\n The wretched ropes were digging into the wizard\u0027s flesh like knives. He would hardly have been surprised if they drew blood. They were certainly cutting off his circulation and numbing his extremities.\\n\\n Trembling with effort, he shifted his fingers another inch.\\n\\n \"My companion is Ryld Argith,\" he said, \"a Master of Melee-Magthere. He\u0027s never done anything to you, and you will place yourself in debt to the warriorsof the pyramid by killing him.\"\\n\\n Entangled as he was, Pharaun couldn\u0027t even turn his head to look at his friend anymore, but he could hear Ryld grunting and swearing and feel him shaking the net. The swordsman was plainly trying to free himself, but it seemed unlikely that even his extraordinary strength would be enough if he was unable to bring one of his blades to bear, and apparently such was the case.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve kept tabs on you through the years.\" Greyanna said. \"I know Master Argith is your most valued comrade. I don\u0027t need him trying to liberate or avenge you. Our mother will handle Melee-Magthere.\"\\n\\n On further inspection, Pharaun observed that the subordinate priestess had readied a scroll as well. That struck him as vaguely odd, but he supposed this was hardly the time to ponder the possible significance.\\n\\n The warriors were approaching steadily but warily, and not merely, he suspected, because of the hovering rapier. Greyanna could neutralize the weapon, but they feared that Pharaun would work some terrible magic that only required speech, not gestures or a focal object. He was sorry to disappoint them. He did have one or two such spells in his memory but none that could annihilate all five of these unpleasant folk at a single stroke, and he knew that once he conjured some devastating attack, they would abandon any intention of taking him alive for a demise by torture. They would strike back as fast and murderously as possible, and immobilized in the mesh, he would have little hope of defending against their efforts.\\n\\n \"Actually, you ought to think twice about harming either of us,\" he said, hoping that further conversation would slow the fighters\u0027 advance, even if only for a second.\\n\\n Greyanna chuckled. \"Be assured, I\u0027ve thought of it a thousand thousand times.\"\\n\\n \"The archmage won\u0027t like it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m acting on behalf of the Council. I doubt he\u0027ll deem it politic to retaliate . . . any more than Melee-Magthere will.\"\\n\\n \"Well, Gromph won\u0027t sign his name to your cadaver, but someday . . .\"\\n\\n Pharaun\u0027s fingers finally jerked into the pocket and closed around a small but sturdy leather glove. With the net still tightening every second, it was just as hard to withdraw the article as it had been to reach it. He experimented to see if he could possibly fumble it through the proper mystical pass.\\n\\n Such a cramped, tiny motion was neither easy nor natural for him. He was accustomed to conjure with a certain flair, making sweeping, dramatic gestures. Yet he had on occasion practiced making the signs as small as possible. It was good for his control and had a few times allowed him to cast a spell without an adversary realizing what he was about. So he had some hope of properly manipulating the glove. If only the web wasn\u0027t so constrictive or his hand so dead and awkward.\\n\\n \"Excuse me,\" Greyanna said, then suspended the conversation to read from her scroll.\\n\\n It was of course divine magic, not arcane, and Pharaun didn\u0027t recognize all the words. The effect, however, was unmistakable. The rapier jerked and fell to the ground with a clank. The masked wizard stepped forward and scooped it up. Pharaun was content at least with the fact that the rapier\u0027s peculiar enchantment would make it impossible for Greyanna\u0027s henchman to turn the weapon on him - at least not for an hour or so.\\n\\n Pharaun recognized the mage, whose high, wide forehead and small, pointed chin were unmistakable. Pharaun had always thought they made the other mage\u0027s head look like an egg. He was Relonor Vrinn, an able wizard and longtime Mizzrym retainer. He was still wearing his silk sash with the spell foci tucked inside and an eight-pointed gold brooch securing it.\\n\\n Scimitars in hand, the warriors approached the net. Judging from their smiles, they\u0027d decided there was nothing to fear and were looking forward to beating the two prisoners unconscious.\\n\\n Pharaun was not yet satisfied with his employment of the glove, but he was rather clearly out of time. He would just have to try the pass and see if it worked. He shifted the focus one more time, meanwhile reciting an incantation under his breath.\\n\\n A giant hand, radiant and translucent, appeared beneath the net. The instantaneous addition of another object lodged inside jerked the mesh even tighter. Pharaun knew the jolt was coming, but he cried out anyway.\\n\\n The pain only intensified when, responding to the wizard\u0027s unspoken command, the hand hurtled twenty-five feet into the air, carrying the net and its prisoners along. For a moment, Pharaun feared he would black out, but the pressure eased. As he\u0027d hoped, and despite the best sliding, bunching efforts of the web of ropes, his own weight was dragging him free. He shoved and thrashed to speed the process along.\\n\\n When he was able, he looked over at Ryld. The hulking warrior was wrestling free of the net as well, though he lost hold of Splitter doing it. The greatsword fell point first, narrowly missed plunging through one of the Mizzrym warriors, and stuck pommel up in the smooth stone surface of the street.\\n\\n \"We have to fall,\" said Ryld. \"If we just float here, they\u0027ll shoot and magic us to pieces.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go,\" Pharaun replied.\\n\\n The masters released their holds and plummeted. One of the soldiers hit Ryld with an arrow, but the missile failed to penetrate his armor. A ball of flame exploded in the air, but Relonor had aimed too high, and the blast only made his targets flinch. Pharaun used his House insignia to slow his descent just a little. He thought that otherwise he\u0027d break his legs.\\n\\n As a result, he saw Ryld - who possessed a similar levitating talisman, his bearing the sigil of Melee-Magthere - reach the ground a moment ahead of him. The Master of Melee-Magthere tucked into a ball, rolled, sprang up with short sword in hand, and lunged at the soldier who\u0027d loosed the arrow. The masked male leaped backward, dropped his bow, and whipped his scimitar our of its scabbard again. While he was so engaged, Ryld yanked Splitter out of the ground.\\n\\n Pharaun landed. Despite his attempt to cushion the impact, it slammed up his legs and sent him staggering. As he fought to recover his balance, he noticed Relonor swirlinghis hands ina star-shaped pattern.\\n\\n As the Master of Sorcere lurched upright, the other mage completed his incantation. A long, angular reptilian thing sprang from the palms of the older drow\u0027s outstretched hands as if they were the doorway to another world. Wreathed in flowing blue flame, the monster charged Pharaun.\\n\\n Relonor was a gifted mage but no marvel as a tactician. In the excitement of the moment, he\u0027d reflexively cast his favorite spell, and characteristically for a Mizzrym retainer, it was an illusion. He\u0027d forgotten that his foe, born in the same House, might well recognize the sequence of mystic passes. Of course, even if Pharaun hadn\u0027t, his silver ring would have shown him what sort of magic the other male was creating.\\n\\n He ignored the phantasm and reached into a pocket to snatch a tiny crystal and commence a spell. He ignored the apparition even when it lunged so close he felt the imaginary but searing heat of its halo of flame.\\n\\n An intense coldness, visible in the fan of drifting ice crystals it instantly created, exploded from his hand. It passed right through the reptile, dissipating the illusion in the process, and washed over Relonor. It painted him with rime, and he fell backward.\\n\\n Pharaun grinned. Greyanna was a fool to accost him with so few retainers in her train. Didn\u0027t she realize that two masters of Tier Breche were more than equal to the worst that she and her four dolts could do?\\n\\n The foulwing flapped its batlike wings and hopped closer to the melee. As its legless body pounded down on the ground, Greyanna opened a leather bag and flung a handful of its contents into the air.\\n\\n The falling motes flared with greenish light when they struck the ground. Each seethed and sparkled upward like a spore instantaneously growing into a fungus. In an instant, a number of animate skeletons stood upon the street. They carried a miscellany of weapons and shields but shared a common purpose. As one, they oriented on the masters and advanced.\\n\\n Shifting back and forth, Ryld cut the undead creatures down. Pharaun took momentary shelter behind his friend, then the swordsman cried out, staggered, and dropped his guard. The skeletons surged forward, and the twins, who\u0027d been hovering at the periphery of the fight, darted in as well.\\n\\n Caught by surprise, Pharaun only just had time to conjure a dazzling, crackling fork of lightning. The power held the enemy back for a moment, and Ryld recovered his balance.\\n\\n \"All right?\" asked the Master of Sorcere.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Ryld chopped a spear-wielding skeleton\u0027s legs out from under it. \"Something was trying to tamper with my mind, but it\u0027s gone now.\"\\n\\n \"It won\u0027t stay gone unless I confront the spellcasters.\"\\n\\n Pharaun floated up into the air, beyond the skeletons\u0027 reach, making sure he would have a clear shot at Greyanna and the others. In his absence, the creatures would likely be able to surround Ryld, but that couldn\u0027t be helped.\\n\\n Surveying the scene, he saw that Relonor was still lying motionless on his back. Positioned beyond the melee, Greyanna and her sister priestess were reading from scrolls.\\n\\n For a moment, Pharaun\u0027s thoughts exploded into a terrifying madness, but reason quickly reasserted itself. He sucked in a deep breath, trying to quell the residual fear, and a second assault wracked his body. He cried out, and the agony passed. Somehow he\u0027d weathered both spells.\\n\\n He threw a seething ball of lighting at Greyanna, but it winked out of existence halfway to the target, unmade by the priestess\u0027s defenses. She and the other cleric employed their scrolls again.\\n\\n A dazzling, searing beam of light erupted from Greyanna\u0027s hand. It slashed across Pharaun\u0027s face, and he closed his eyes just in time to keep it from blinding him. It was painful nonetheless, but his own defenses kept it from burning his face off.\\n\\n The other priestess flailed at him with a sizzling bolt of lightning. As it was one of his own favorite forces to command, it hardly seemed fair. He stiffened with the shock for a moment or two, and the magic lost its grip on him.\\n\\n He feared the spasm had cost him precious time. By the time it passed, he thought the priestesses were surely in the process of casting new spells, but when he looked at the lesser of the two she wasn\u0027t creating any magic. She\u0027d dropped her suddenly blank scroll on the ground and was rooting in her leather pouch, presumably for another means of magical attack.\\n\\n Clasping a bit of coal and a tiny dried eyeball held in a little vial, Pharaun created an effect. Power sighed and rippled through the air, and a mass of darkness appeared around the female\u0027s head, blinding her.\\n\\n The wizard\u0027s thoughts flew apart once more, then reassembled themselves. He rounded on Greyanna. She was still clutching her scroll, evidently still casting from it. He began to conjure, and she, evidently uncertain of the parchment\u0027s power to protect her, tore open the bag.\\n\\n It had occurred to Pharaun that the sack might have more spores in it, but he\u0027d assumed they would produce more skeletons. This time, though, the glittering motes burst in midair, swelling into ugly little beasts resembling a cross between a bat and a mosquito.\\n\\n The stirges swirled around him, jabbing at him with their proboscises, striving to drink his blood. They interfered with the motion of his hands and so spoiled his conjuration. He restored his weight and fell back to the ground, where Ryld, beset by clinking skeletons on all sides, beheaded one with a sudden cut. One of the twins edged toward him but balked when the big male pivoted in his direction.\\n\\n Pharaun slammed down on the street. Trailing chattering stirges, he sprinted toward the fallen Relonor. A couple skeletons turned to hack at him, but most of them were too intent on killing Ryld to notice him. Up close, the things stank. Pharaun thought they must still have some scraps of rotting flesh about them somewhere.\\n\\n Just as he reached the unconscious wizard, Greyanna\u0027s foulwing landed on the other side of the body with a ground-shaking thump. Pharaun roared out a painfully loud magical shout, and the beast recoiled, carrying its rider with it.\\n\\n Pharaun stooped, ripped the brooch off Relonor\u0027s sash, turned, and ran. Greyanna screamed in rage. The foulwing roared its strange double roar, and two sets of jaws clashed shut behind the fleeing male.\\n\\n A stirge\u0027s proboscis jabbed him in the back, staggering him, but was unable to penetrate hispiwafwi. Another spell rattled his mind but with no permanent ill effects. A skeleton appeared on his flank, swinging a notched, rusty axe at his head. Splitter flashed in an arc and smashed the undead thing into tiny pieces.\\n\\n Pharaun caught hold of the hem of Ryld\u0027spiwafwi and glanced around at Greyanna.\\n\\n Her face a mask of fury, she tossed away her scroll, which was likely blank, and held her hands high to receive the long staff materializing from some extradimensional storage. He could see why she wanted the instrument. It blazed with mystic power, but it was also slow in attaining tangibility. Some chance interaction of the magical energies playing about the battleground was retarding its transition to the physical plane.\\n\\n Why, then, didn\u0027t she leave off summoning it and attack in some other manner? Why - \\n\\n In a flash of inspiration, the answer came to him, and it was astonishing.\\n\\n But he was scarcely in a place conducive to contemplation of his discovery,and it was time to remedy that. He peered at the brooch he\u0027d taken from Relonor, found the trigger word implicit in the kaleidoscopic pattern shining around it, and spoke.\\n\\n Greyanna regarded the open space in the middle of the ring of aimlessly milling skeletons, and the stirges swooping and wheeling above. A moment before, Pharaun and his hulking accomplice had been standing there, but they were gone. If her eyes had not deceived her, her brother had flashed her that old familiar mocking grin as he vanished. How dare he smirk at her like that when it was she who had driven him from House Mizzrym!\\n\\n She regarded her iron staff, taller than she was, square in cross-section, graven with hundreds of tiny runes, and warm as blood to the touch. The weapon had failed her. She trembled with the impulse to swing it over her head and smash it against the stone beneath her feet until it was defaced, deformed, and useless.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t, because she knew Pharaun\u0027s escape was really her fault, not the staff\u0027s. She should have summoned the weapon sooner. She should have been more aggressive with the sack. Damn this degrading and inexplicable season! Because of its vicissitudes, her mother had instructed her to play the miser with every personal resource, even though she was fighting for the welfare of House Mizzrym and all Menzoberranzan.\\n\\n Well, she wouldn\u0027t make the same mistake next time. It was her responsibility to look after her troops and return them to the castle. She dismounted, squared her shoulders, put on a calm, commanding expression, and proceeded with the business at hand.\\n\\n Neither of the twins were hurt, and her cousin Aunrae merely needed the ball of darkness around her head dispelled. It was Relonor who concerned Greyanna, but fortunately the mage was still alive. A healing potion mended him sufficiently to stand, clutching his sash so it wouldn\u0027t slip off and shrugging out of his ice-encrusted cloak.\\n\\n While the twins helped Relonor hobble about and so restore his circulation, Aunrae came sidling up to Greyanna. To her cousin\u0027s admittedly jaundiced eye, in Aunrae the usual Mizzrym tendency to leanness had run to a grotesque extreme. The younger female resembled a stick insect.\\n\\n \"My commiseration on your failure,\" Aunrae said.\\n\\n Her expression was grave, but she wasn\u0027t really trying to hide the smile lurking underneath.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t realize just how powerful Pharaun has become,\" Greyanna admitted. \"Before his exile, he was quite competent but nothing extraordinary. It was his cunning that made him so dangerous. I see that all the decades in Tier Breche have turned him into one of the most formidable wizards in the city. That complicates things, but I\u0027ll manage.\"\\n\\n \"I hope the matron will forgive you your ignorance,\" Aunrae said. \"You\u0027ve wasted so much magic to no effect.\"\\n\\n The conjured skeletons and stirges began to wink out of existence, leaving a residue of magic energy. The air seemed to tingle and buzz, though if a person stopped and listened, it really wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"Is that how you see it?\" Greyanna asked.\\n\\n Aunrae shrugged. \"I\u0027m just worried she\u0027ll feel you bungled things, that your hatred of Pharaun made you blind and clumsy. She might even decide someone else is more deserving of the preeminence you currently possess. Of course, I hope not! You know I wish you well. My plan for my future has always been to support you and prosper as your aide.\"\\n\\n \"Cousin, your words move me,\" Greyanna said as she lifted the staff.\\n\\n No one could heave such a long, heavy implement into a fighting position without giving the opponent an instant\u0027s warning, so Aunrae was able to come on guard. It didn\u0027t matter. Not bothering to unleash any of the magic within her weapon, wielding it like an ordinary quarterstaff, Greyanna bashed the mace from the younger priestess\u0027s fingers, knocked her flat with a ringing blow to her armored shoulder, and dug the tip of the iron rod into her throat.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to confer on one or two matters,\" said Greyanna. \"Doyouhave a moment?\"\\n\\n Aunrae made a liquid, strangling sound.\\n\\n \"Excellent. Listen and grow wise. Today\u0027s little fracas was not in vain. It proved that Relonor can locate Pharaun with his divinations. Even more importantly, the battle enabled me to take our brother\u0027s measure. When we track him down again, we\u0027ll crush him. Now, do you see that I have this venture well in hand?\"\\n\\n Deprived of her voice, Aunrae nodded enthusiastically. Her chin bumped against the butt of the staff.\\n\\n \"What a sensible girl you are. You must also bear in mind that we aren\u0027t hunting Pharaun simply for my own personal gratification. It\u0027s for the benefit of all, including yourself. Therefore, this isn\u0027t an ideal time to seek to discredit and supplant one of your betters. It\u0027s a time for us to swallow our mutual distaste and work together until the threat is gone. Do you think you can remember that?\"\\n\\n Aunrae kept nodding. She was shaking, too, and her eyes were wide with terror. Small wonder; she must have been running short of breath. Still, she had the sense not to try to grab the staff and jerk it away from her neck. She knew what would happen if she tried.\\n\\n Greyanna was tempted to make it happen anyway. Aunrae\u0027s submission was a small pleasure beside the fierce satisfaction that would come from ramming the staff into the helpless female\u0027s windpipe. The urge was a hot tightness in her hands and a throbbing in the scar across her face.\\n\\n But she needed minions to catch the relative she truly hated, and, annoying as she was, Aunrae was game, and wielded magic with a certain facility. It would be more practical to murder her another day.\\n\\n Greyanna was sure she could manage it whenever she chose. Despite her ambitions, Aunrae was no threat. She lacked the intelligence.\\n\\n Feeling a strange pang of nostalgia for Sabal, who had at least been a rival worth destroying, Greyanna lifted the staff away from her cousin\u0027s throat.\\n\\n \"You will whisper no poison words in Mother\u0027s ears,\" the First Daughter of House Mizzrym said. \"For the time being, you will leave off plotting against me or anyone else. You will devote your every thought to finding our truant brother. Otherwise, I\u0027ll put an end to you.\"\\n\\n Ryld had never experienced instantaneous travel before. To his surprise, he was conscious of the split second of teleportation, and he found it rather unpleasant. It didn\u0027t feel as if he were speeding through the world but as if the world were hurtling at and through him, albeit painlessly.\\n\\n Then it was over. He\u0027d unconsciously braced himself to compensate for the jolt of a sudden stop, and the absence of any such sensation rocked him on his feet.\\n\\n By the time he recovered his balance, he knew more or less where he was. A whiff of dung told him. He looked around and confirmed the suspicion.\\n\\n Pharaun had dropped the two of them in a disused sentry post on a natural balcony. The ledge overlooked Donigarten with its moss fields, grove of giant mushrooms, and fungus farms fertilized with night soil from the city. Hordes of orc and goblin slaves either tended the malodorous croplands or speared fish from rafts on the lake, while rothe lowed from the island in the center of the water. Overseers and an armed patrol wandered the fields to keep the thralls in line. Additional guards looked down from other high perches about the cavern wall.\\n\\n Ryld knew Pharaun had transported them about as far as was possible. In the Realms that See the Sun, teleportation could carry folk around the world, but in the Underdark, the disruptive radiance of certain elements present in the rock limited the range to about half a mile - far enough to throw Greyanna and her pack off the scent.\\n\\n Pharaun held the pilfered golden ornament up, inspecting it.\\n\\n \"It only holds one teleportation at a time,\" he said after a moment. Even after all his exertions, he wasn\u0027t panting as hard as he might have been; not bad for such a sybarite, thought Ryld as he set down his bloody great-sword. \"It\u0027s useless now, and I lost my dancing rapier, curse it, but I\u0027m not too disconsol - \"\\n\\n Ryld grabbed Pharaun by the arm and flipped him, laying him down hard.\\n\\n The wizardblinked, sat up, and brushed a strand of his sculpted hair back into place.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027d told me you craved more fighting,\" Pharaun said, \"I could have left you behind with my kin.\"\\n\\n \"The hunters, you mean,\" Ryld growled, \"who found us quickly.\"\\n\\n \"Well, we asked a fair number of questions in a fair number of places. We evenwanted someone to find us, just not that lot.\" Pharaun stood back up and brushed at his garments, adding, \"Now, I have\\n\\n something extraordinary to tell you.\"\\n\\n \"Save it,\" Ryld replied. \"Back there in the net, when you and Greyanna were chatting, I got the strong impression that the priestesses weren\u0027t just hunting some faceless agent. They knew from the start their target was you, and you knew they knew.\"\\n\\n Pharaun sighed. \"I didn\u0027t know thematrons would choose Greyanna to discourage our efforts. That was a somewhat disconcerting surprise. But the rest of it? Yes.\"\\n\\n \"How?\"\\n\\n \"Gromph has invisible glyphs scribed on the walls of his office. Invisible to most people, anyway. They protect him in various ways. One, a black sigil shaped a little like a bat, is supposed to keep scryers and spellcasters from eavesdropping on his private conversations, but when he and I spoke, it was drawn imperfectly. It still would have balked many a spy, but not someone with the resources and expertise of, oh, say, his sisters ... or the Council.\"\\n\\n Ryld frowned. \"Gromph botched it?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" Pharaun snorted. \"Do you think the Archmage of Menzoberranzan incompetent? He drew it precisely as he wanted it. He knew the high priestesses were trying to spy on him - they surely always have and doubtless always will - and he intended them to overhear.\"\\n\\n \"He was setting you up.\"\\n\\n \"Nowyou\u0027re getting it. While the clerics stay busy seeking me, the decoy, my illustrious chief will undertake another, more discreet inquiry undisturbed, by performing divinations and interrogating demons, probably. \"\\n\\n \"You knew, and you undertook the mission anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Because knowing doesn\u0027t change my fundamental circumstances. If I want to retain my rank and quite possibly my life, I still have to complete the task the archwizard set me, even though he was playing me for a fool, even with Greyanna striving to hinder the process.\" Pharaun grinned and added, \"Besides, wheredid all those runaways go, and why do the greatest folk in Menzoberranzan care? It\u0027s a fascinating puzzle, even more so nowthat I\u0027ve inferred a portion of the answer. Did I leave it unsolved, it would haunt me forevermore.\"\\n\\n \"You played me for a fool,\" said Ryld. \"Granted, you warned me the priestesses might interfere with us, but you greatly understated the danger. You didn\u0027t tell me you were marked before we even descended from Tier Breche. Why not? Did you think I\u0027d refuse to accompany you?\"\\n\\n Most uncharacteristically, the glib wizard hesitated. Far below the shelf, a whip snapped and a goblin screamed.\\n\\n \"No,\" said Pharaun eventually, \"not really. I suppose it\u0027s just that dark elves are jealous of their secrets. So are the nobly born. So are wizards. And I\u0027m all three! Will you pardon me? It isn\u0027t as if you\u0027ve never kept a secret from me.\"\\n\\n \"When?\"\\n\\n \"During the first three years of our acquaintance, whenever we fraternized, you kept a dagger specially charmed for the killing of mages ever close to your hand. You suspected I was only seeking your company because one of your rivals in Melee-Magthere had engaged me to murder you as soon as the opportunity arose.\"\\n\\n \"How did you discover that? Never mind, I suppose it was your silver ring. I didn\u0027t know what it was back then. Anyway, that\u0027s not the same kind of secret.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right, it isn\u0027t, and I regret my reticence but I do proposeto make up for it by sharing the most astonishing confidence you\u0027ve ever heard.\"\\n\\n Ryld stared into Pharaun\u0027s eyes. \"I\u0027ll pardon you. With the understanding that if you withhold any other pertinent information, I\u0027ll knock you over the head and deliver you to your bitch sister myself.\"\\n\\n \"Point taken. Shall we sit?\" Pharaun pointed to a bench hewn from the limestone wall at the back of the ledge. \"My discourse may take a little time, and I daresay we could use a rest after our exertions.\"\\n\\n As he turned away from the molded rock rampart, Ryld noticed that the cracking of the whip had stopped. When he glanced down, two goblins were carrying the corpse of a third, hauling it somewhere to be chopped apart and the pieces turned to some useful purpose. Possibly chow for other thralls.\\n\\n The fencing teacher sat down and removed a cloth, a whetstone, and a vial of oil from the pockets of his garments. He unfastened his short sword from his belt, pulled on the hilt, and made alittle spitting sound of displeasure when the blade, which he had been forced to put away bloody, stuck in the scabbard. He yanked more forcefully, and it came free.\\n\\n He looked over at Pharaun, who was regarding with him with a sort of quizzical exasperation.\\n\\n \"Talk,\" the warrior said. \"I can care for my gear and listen at the same time.\"\\n\\n \"Isthis how you attend to mind-boggling revelations? I suppose I\u0027m lucky you don\u0027t have to use the Jakes. All right, here it is ... Lolth is gone. Well, maybe notgone, but unavailable at least in the sense that it\u0027s no longer possible for her Menzoberranyr clerics to receive spells from her.\"\\n\\n For a moment, Ryld thought he\u0027d misheard the words. \"I guess that\u0027s a joke?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t make it while we were in the middle of a crowd. There\u0027s no point compounding our crimes with blasphemy.\"\\n\\n \"Blasphemy or not, it\u0027s the truth.\"\\n\\n Rag in hand, Ryld scrubbed tacky blood off the short sword. \"What are you suggesting,\" the weapons master asked, \"another Time of Troubles? Could there be two such upheavals?\"\\n\\n Pharaun grinned and said, \"Possibly, but I think not. When the gods were forced to inhabit the mortal world, the arcane forces we wizards command fluctuated unpredictably. One day, we could mold the world like clay. The next, we couldn\u0027t turn ice to water. That isn\u0027t happening now. My powers remain constant as ever, from which I tentatively infer this is not the Time of Troubles come again but a different sort of occurrence.\"\\n\\n \"What sort?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, am I supposed to know that already? I thought I was doing rather well to detect the occurrence at all.\"\\n\\n \"Only if it\u0027s really happening.\"\\n\\n Ryld inspected the point of the short stabbing blade, then took the hone to it. Bemused by Pharaun\u0027s contention, he wondered how his canny friend could credit such a ludicrous idea.\\n\\n \"I want you to think back over the confrontation from which we just emerged,\" said the Master of Sorcere. \"Did you even once see Greyanna or the other priestess cast divine magic from her own mind and inner strength as opposed to off a scroll or out of some device?\"\\n\\n \"I was fighting the skeletons.\"\\n\\n \"You keep track of every foe on the battleground. I know you do. So, did you see them casting spells out of their own innate power?\"\\n\\n Ryld thought that of course he had . . . then realized he hadn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"What does that suggest?\" Pharaun asked. \"They have no spells left in their heads, or only a few, which they\u0027re hoarding desperately because they can\u0027t solicit new ones from their goddess. Lolth has withdrawn her favor from Menzoberranzan, or ... something.\"\\n\\n \"Why would she do that?\"\\n\\n \"Would she need a reason - or at any rate, one her mortal children can comprehend? She is a deity of chaos. Perhaps she\u0027s testing us somehow, or else she\u0027s angry and deems us unworthy of her patronage.\\n\\n \"Or, as I suggested before, the cause of her silence, if in fact she is mute when her clerics pray to her and not just uncooperative, may be something else altogether. Perhaps even another happenstance involving all the gods. Since we have only one faith and clergy in Menzoberranzan, it\u0027s difficult to judge.\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Ryld said. He unstoppered his little bottle of oil. The sharp smell provided a welcome counterpoint to the moist stink of the dung fields. \"I admit, I didn\u0027t see Greyanna or any of the lesser priestesses working magic, but didn\u0027t you yourself once tell me that in the turmoil of battle, it\u0027soften easier and more reliable to cast your effects from a wand or parchment?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose I did. Still, under normal circumstances, would you expect a pair of spellcasters to conjure every single manifestation that way? Just before our exit, I saw Greyanna groping in the ether for a weapon that was slow in coming to her hand. The sister I remember would have said to the Hells with it and dumped some other magic on our heads. That is, unless something had circumscribed her options.\"\\n\\n \"I see what you mean,\" Ryld conceded, \"but when the clerics lost their powers in the Time of Troubles, it destabilized the balance of power among the noble Houses. Those who believed the change made them stronger in relative terms struck hard to supplant their rivals. As far as I can see, that isn\u0027t happening now, just the usual level of controlled enmity.\"\\n\\n He laid the short sword aside and picked up Splitter.\\n\\n Pharaun nodded and said, \"You\u0027ll recall that none of the Houses attempting to exploit the Time of Troubles ultimately profited thereby. To the contrary, the Baenre and others punished them for their\\n\\n temerity. Perhaps the matron mothers took the lesson to heart.\"\\n\\n \"So instead of hatching schemes to topple one another, they . . . what? Enlisted every single priestess in a grand conspiracy to conceal their fall from grace? If your mad idea is right, that\u0027s what they must have done.\"\\n\\n \"Why is that implausible? Picture the day - a few tendays past? - when they lost the ability to draw power from their goddess. Clerics of Lolth routinely collaborate in magical rituals, so they would have discovered fairly quickly that they were all similarly afflicted. Apprised of the scope of the situation, Triel Baenre, possibly in hurried consultation with our esteemed Mistress Quenthel and the matrons of the Council, might well have decided to conceal the priesthood\u0027s debility and sent the word round in time to keep anyone from blabbing.\"\\n\\n \"The word would have to pass pretty damn quickly,\" said Ryld, examining Splitter\u0027s edge. As he\u0027d expected, despite all the bone it had just bitten through, it was as preternaturally keen and free of notches and chips as ever.\\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" the wizard said. \"If you lost the strength of your arms, would you be eager to announce it, knowing the news would find its way to everyone who\u0027d ever taken a dislike to you? Anyway, since this is the first we\u0027ve learned of the problem, the deception obviously did organize in time.\"\\n\\n \"Or else everything is as it always was, and the plot exists only in your imagination.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s real. I\u0027m sure Triel deemed the ruse necessary to make sure no visitor would discern Menzoberranzan\u0027s sudden weakness.\" He grinned and added, \"And to fix it so we poor males wouldn\u0027t swoon with terror upon learning that our betters had lost a measure of their ability to guide and protect us.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s an amusing fancy.\"\\n\\n \"Fire and glare, you\u0027re a hard boy to convince, and I\u0027ll be cursed if I know why. You\u0027ve already lived through the Time of Troubles, the previous Matron Baenre\u0027s death, and the defeat of Menzoberranzan by a gaggle of wretched dwarves. Why do you assume our world cannot have altered in some fundamental way when you\u0027ve watched it change so many times before? Open your mind, and you\u0027ll see my hypothesis makes sense of all that has puzzled us.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Whatever they\u0027re up to, how is it that for the past month an unusual number of males have dared to elope from their families? Because they somehow tumbled to the fact that a priestess\u0027s wrath now constitutes less of a threat.\"\\n\\n \"While the clerics,\" said Ryld, catching the thread of the argument, \"are eager to catch them because they want to know how the males know about the Silence, if we\u0027re going to call it that. Hells, if all those males had the nerve to run away, maybe they even know more about the problem than the females do.\"\\n\\n \"Conceivably,\" said Pharaun. \"The priestesses can\u0027t rule it out until they strap a few of them to torture racks, can they? But they don\u0027t want Gromph involved with capturing the rogues because . . . ?\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t want him to find out what the runaways know.\"\\n\\n \"Very good, apprentice. We\u0027ll make a logician of you yet.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think the archmage already knows the divines have lost their magic?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d bet your left eye on it, but he\u0027s in the same cart as the high priestesses. He posits that the fugitives might know even more.\"\\n\\n Ryld nodded. \"In a war, or any crisis, you have to cover every possibility.\"\\n\\n \"The notion of the Silence even explains why the Jewel Box was so crowded, and why some of the patrons were in a belligerent humor or even bruised and battered. Females divested of their magic might well feel weak and vulnerable. Consciously or otherwise, they\u0027d worry about losing control of the folk in their household and compensate by instituting a harsher discipline than usual.\"\\n\\n \"I see that,\" said Ryld.\\n\\n \"Of course you do. As I said, the one hypothesis accounts for every anomaly. That\u0027s why we can be confident the idea is valid.\"\\n\\n \"How does it account for the relative paucity of goods in the Bazaar?\"\\n\\n Pharaun blinked, narrowed his eyes in thought, and finally laughed. \"You know, it\u0027s difficult for genius to soar in the face of these carping little irrelevancies. Actually, you\u0027re right. At first glance, the Silence doesn\u0027t explain the marketplace, but it explains so much else that I still believe the idea correct. Have I persuaded you?\"\\n\\n \"I... maybe. You do make a kind of twisted sense. It\u0027s just that its a hard idea to take in. The one truth our people have never questioned is that Menzoberranzan belongs to Lolth. Everything in the cavern is as it is because she willed it so, and the might of her priestesses is the primary force maintaining all that we have and are. If she\u0027s turned her face from the entire city, or is lost to us in some other way. . . .\" Ryld spread his hands.\\n\\n \"It is unsettling, but perhaps, just perhaps, it affords us an opportunity as well.\"\\n\\n Ryld extended a telescoping metal probe, attached a cloth to the hook on the end, and started swamping out the blood-clogged scabbard.\\n\\n The warrior asked, \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Just for fun, let\u0027s make the same leap of faith - or fear - that Gromph and the Council did. Assume the rogue males can explain the cessation of Lolth\u0027s beneficence. Assume you and I will find them and extract the information. Finally, assume we can somehow employ it to restore the status quo.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a lot of assuming.\"\\n\\n \"It is. Obviously, I\u0027m letting my imagination run amok. Yet I have a hunch - only a hunch, but still - that if two masters of the Academy could accomplish such a triumph, they might thereby win enough power to make my friend the Sarthos demon look like small beer. You wanted to find something to our advantage, as I recall.\"\\n\\n \"Your sister may find us first. She tracked us once. Do you still think we shouldn\u0027t kill her, or her vassals\\n\\n either?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a good question,\" Pharaun sighed. \"They\u0027re attacking us with potent magic. I suspect that leather bag holds nine sets of servant creatures, each deadlier than the one before.\"\\n\\n \"In that case, why didn\u0027t she chuck them all at us?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps, in the absence of her innate powers, she was trying to conserve her other resources. Alas, she may not be so parsimonious next time.\"\\n\\n \"So what do we do?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you know, I truly do want to kill Greyanna. I always have, but I suppose the prudent course is to avoid our hunters if possible. If not, we\u0027ll do what we must to survive. I may at least make a point of disposing of Relonor. I suspect he located us with divinatory magic. He was always good at that.\"\\n\\n \"Can you shield us?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps. I intend to try. Stay right where you are, and don\u0027t speak.\"\\n\\n Pharaun rose and reached into one of his pockets. Out in the lake, something big jumped. Noticing the splash, an orc on a raft grunted to his fellows, and they readied their barb-headed lances. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dissolution-war-of-the-spider-queen-1/page-8.html","bookId":2159,"book":{"id":2159,"title":"Dissolution (War of the Spider Queen #1)","description":"Storyline: Dissolution (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
