{"id":97633,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"As Drisinil took hold of the door handle, the stump of her little finger throbbed beneath its dressing. The novice still found it difficult to believe that, after fighting for her life against the demon spider, Mistress Quenthel had immediately returned to the matter of the would-be truants and their self-inflicted punishment. It bespoke a calm and meticulous nature. Drisinil admired those qualities, but it didn\u0027t make her hate their exemplar any less. She took a final glance around the deserted corridor. No one was about, and no one was supposed to be, not in that length of that particular wing of Arach-Tinilith at that hour of the night. She slipped through the sandstone door and pulled it shut behind her. Unlike much of the temple, no lamps, torches, or candles burned in the room beyond the threshold. That was by design, to keep a telltale gleam from leaking out under the door. Drisinil\u0027s sister conspirators awaited her. Some were novices with bandaged hands, just like herself. Others were instructors. Those high priestesses, hampered by their dignity, were having some difficulty making themselves comfortable among the haphazardly stacked boxes and tangles of furniture littering the half-forgotten storeroom. Of course, it didn\u0027t help that they hesitated to clear away the shrouds of filthy cobwebs dangling everywhere for fear a living spider remained within. Drisinil wondered if that particular prohibition made sense any longer.Perhaps spiders were no longer sacred. Then, angry at herself, she pushed the blasphemous thought away. Lolth abided, beyond any question, and was likely to chastise those who even for a moment imagined otherwise. Once she wrenched her mind back to immediate concerns, Drisinil was momentarily nonplussed to find the company regarding her expectantly, Did they expect her to preside over the meeting? But then again, why not? She might be a novice, but she was Barrison Del\u0027Armgo as well, and breeding mattered, perhaps more than ever when even the most powerful priestesses were running out of magic. Besides, the secret gathering had been her idea. \"Good evening,\" she said. \"Thank you all for attending,\" - she smiled wryly - \"and for not reporting me to Quenthel Baenre.\" \"We still could,\" said Vlondril Tuin\u0027Tarl, a strange smile on her wrinkled lips. \"Your task is to convince us we shouldn\u0027t.\" The teacher was so old that she had begun to wither like a human crone. Most folk believed her mystical contemplations of ultimate chaos had left her a little mad. No one, not even another instructor, had opted to sit in her immediate vicinity. \"With respect, Holy Mother,\" Drisinil said, \"isn\u0027t that self-evident? The goddess, who nurtured and exalted our city since its founding, has turned her back on us.\" Once again, Drisinil couldn\u0027t help thinking of other possibilities, but even if she\u0027d seen a point to it, she wouldn\u0027t have dared to mention them. No one would, not in her present company. \"And Quenthel is to blame,\" added Molvayas Barrison Del\u0027Armgo. Though stockier and shorter than Drisinil, her aunt had the same sort of sharp nose and uncommon green eyes. Richly clad, the elder scion of the House carried an enemy\u0027s soul imprisoned in a jade ring, and at quiet moments one could occasionally hear the spirit weeping and pleading for release. Second to Quenthel as Barrison Del\u0027Armgo was ever second to Baenre, Molvayas had helped her niece pass word of the meeting, and her support lent it a certain credibility. \"How do you know that?\" asked T\u0027risstree T\u0027orgh. Deceptively slender, a fully trained warrior as well as a priestess, she was notorious for carrying a naked falchion about in preference to the usual mace or whip of fangs, and gashing the exposed flesh of any student who displeased her with a fast but precisely controlled cut to the face. The short, curved blade lay across her knees. Drisinil waited a beat to make sure Molvayas intended her to answer the question. Apparently she did, and rightly so, since it was the younger female who had actually conceived the argument. \"When Triel was mistress here,\" said the novice, \"all was well. Shortly after Quenthel assumed the office, Lolth rejected us.\" \" \u0027Shortly\u0027 being a relative term,\" said a sardonic voice from somewhere in the back of the room. \"Shortly enough,\" Drisinil retorted. \"Perhaps the goddess gave us time to rectify the error. We failed to do so, so now she\u0027s punishing us.\" \"She\u0027s afflicting all Menzoberranzan,\" T\u0027risstree said, \"not just Tier Breche.\" \"Surely,\" said Drisinil, \"you didn\u0027t expect her to befair . I hope a priestess knows Lolth\u0027s ways better than that. Her wrath is as boundless as her might. Besides which, Arach-Tinilith is the repository of the deepest mysteries and thus the mystic heart of Menzoberranzan. It makes perfect sense that whatever befalls us here should touch the city as a whole. \"In any case,\" the novice continued, \"Lolth has shown us her intent. Despite our safeguards, two spirits invaded the temple, the first in the guise of a spider, the second a living darkness. Spider and darkness, reflections of the essence of the goddess. The demons injured those who got in their way. They bruised them and broke their bones, but they didn\u0027t try to kill any of us, did they? They were plainly seeking Quenthel, and they sought to kill her and her alone.\" Some of the other priestesses frowned or nodded thoughtfully. \"It did seem that way,\"said Vlondril, \"but what do you think is unacceptable about Quenthel? Isn\u0027t she doing all the same things Triel did?\" \"We don\u0027t know everything she does,\" said Drisinil, \"and we don\u0027t know what she thinks. Lolth does.\" \"But you don\u0027t know she sent the demons,\" T\u0027risstree said. Born a commoner but risen to a level of power and prestige, she had evidently shed the habit of deference to the aristocracy. \"Perhaps one of Quenthel\u0027s mortal enemies sent them.\" \"What mortal possesses a magic potent and cunning enough to penetrate the temple wards?\" Drisinil replied. \"The archmage?\" Vlondril offered, picking at the skin on the back of her hand. Her tone was light, as if she spoke in jest. \"Even if he does,\" Drisinil said, \"Gromph is a Baenre, too, and Quenthel serving as mistress strengthens his House. He has no reason to kill her, and if it isn\u0027t he, then who? Who but the goddess?\" \"Quenthel is still alive,\" said a priestess from House Xorlarrin. She\u0027d worn a long veil to the conclave, apparently so anyone who noticed her walking the halls would assume she was engaged in a certain necromantic meditation. \"Do we think Lolth tried to kill her and failed?\" \"Perhaps,\" Drisinil said. Some of her audience scowled or stiffened at what could be construed as blasphemy. \"She is all-powerful, but her agents are not. However, I think she intended the first two assassins to fail. She\u0027s giving her priestesses a chance to ponder what\u0027s happening. To comprehend her will, perform our appointed task, and earn her favor once more.\" Vlondril smiled. \"And we do that by murdering Quenthel ourselves? Oh, good, child, very good.\" \"We kill her ourselves,\" Drisinil agreed, \"or, if that isn\u0027t feasible, we at least assist the next demonic assassin in whatever way we can.\" T\u0027risstree shook her head. \"This is sheer speculation. You don\u0027t know the mistress\u0027s death will bring Lolth back.\" \"It\u0027s worth a chance,\" Drisinil said. \"At the very least, if we give the demons what they want, they\u0027ll stop invading Arach-Tinilith. They haven\u0027t slain any of us yet, but if we don\u0027t help them, and Quenthel lives on, they may decide to eliminate us, too, for after all, it\u0027s a demon\u0027s nature to kill.\" \"The demons may be less dangerous than House Baenre,\" T\u0027risstree said. \"The Baenre won\u0027t know who facilitated Quenthel\u0027s demise,\" Drisinil said. \"So what will they do, wreak their vengeance on every priestess in Arach-Tinilith? They can\u0027t. They need us to educate their daughters and perform the secret rites.\" \"If Quenthel dies,\" said a priestess leaning against the wall, \"Molvayas has a fair chance of becoming Mistress of Arach-Tinilith - but how do the rest of us stand to gain?\" \"My niece has explained,\" said Molvayas, \"that we\u0027ll allrenew our bond with the goddess and replenish our magic. Beyond that, I promise that if I become mistress, I\u0027ll remember those who lifted me up. High priestesses, you will be my lieutenants, ranking higher than any other instructor. Novices, your time at Arach-Tinilith will be spent far more pleasantly than is the rule. You, too, will exercise authority over your peers. You\u0027ll enjoy luxuries. I\u0027ll excuse you from the more onerous ordeals and teach you secrets most pupils never learn.\" \"We\u0027ll hold you to that,\" said another voice from the back, \"and expose you if you renege.\" \"Exactly,\" said Molvayas. \"You\u0027ll always be in a position to inform House Baenre of my guilt. Your numbers are too great for me to murder all of you, and so you know you can trust me to keep my pledge. Even if it were otherwise, I\u0027d be stupid to play you false, considering that I\u0027ll always need loyal supporters.\" \"It\u0027s tempting,\" the veiled Xorlarrin said. \"I\u0027d take almost any chance to win my magic back. Still, we\u0027re talking about the Baenre.\" \"Damn the Baenre!\" Drisinil spat. \"Perhaps killing Quenthel is the first rumble of the cave-in that will bury the entire clan.\" \"What cave-in?\" T\u0027risstree asked. \"I don\u0027t know, exactly,\" Drisinil admitted. \"Still, consider this: Houses rise and fall. It\u0027s the way of Menzoberranzan and the will of Lolth. Thus far, House Baenre has been the exception, perching on the top of the heap for century after century. Perhaps, with the old matron mother\u0027s death, the family has finally forfeited the goddess\u0027s regard. Why not . . . everyone knows Triel is out of her depth. Perhaps it\u0027s time at last for House Baenre to honor the universal law. If so, wouldn\u0027t it be glorious to commence the decline in their fortunes here, now, this very minute in this very room?\" \"Yes,\" T\u0027risstree declared. Surprised, Drisinil turned to face her. \"You agree?\" Setting her razor-edged falchion aside, T\u0027risstree rose and said, \"I was dubious, but you convinced me.\" For an instant, she grinned. \"I don\u0027t like Quenthel anyway. So yes, we\u0027ll usher her into her tomb, regain the goddess\u0027s approval, and run the academy as we please.\" She extended her hands. Drisinil smiled and clasped them despite the twin shooting pains the pressure produced, thenshe turned to the other females and said, \"What about the rest of you? Are you with us?\" They tendered a ragged chorus of assent. She guessed that those who doubted she had hit on the way to propitiate Lolth were nonetheless eager to move up in the temple hierarchy, or at least disliked Quenthel. Maybe they were simply indulging the innate dark elf taste for bloodshed and betrayal. Drisinil herself truly did believe she\u0027d contrived the proper metaphysical remedy for their woes but deep down, she was even more excited at the prospect of avenging herself on her torturer. How could it be otherwise? For the rest of her life, her self-mutilated hands would announce to any who looked that someone had once defeated and humiliated her. \"I thank you,\" she said to the other clerics. \"Now, let\u0027s put our heads together. We have much to plan and only a little time before others will start to miss us.\" And plan they did, whispering, bickering, occasionally grinning at some particularly inventive and vicious suggestion. Drisinil knew that some if not all of the scheming would come to nothing - it was too contingent on Quenthel\u0027s doing precisely what the plotters wanted exactly when and where they wanted it done - but the effort served to cement their commitment to the conspiracy and to limn at least the bare bones of a strategy. Finally it was done. The priestesses started to slip out the way they\u0027d come, one and two at a time. The more restless stood in a clump around the exit, awaiting their turns. T\u0027risstree was among them. Drisinil crossed the floor in as relaxed and casual a manner as she could affect. She didn\u0027t want someone to realize her intent, and, surprised, react in some audible way. No one did. All dark elves were actors in that they were liars, and perhaps she was a better dissembler than most. She sauntered within arm\u0027s reach of T\u0027risstree, took hold of the dirk concealed inside her long, fringed shawl, and drove the blade into the high priestess\u0027s spine. This time, for whatever reason, the stumps of her severed pinkies didn\u0027t hurt a bit. T\u0027risstree\u0027s back arched in a spasm of agony, and, to Drisinil\u0027s surprise, her teacher tried to flounder around to face her. Her arm shaking, T\u0027risstree lifted the falchion. Drisinil turned along with the high priestess, keeping behind her. She grabbed hold of T\u0027risstree\u0027s hair, jerked her head back, and sliced open her throat. The instructor collapsed. The sword slipped from her fingers and clanked on the floor. The onlookers gawked. \"T\u0027risstree T\u0027orgh meant to betray us,\" Drisinil said. \"I saw it in her eyes when I took her hands. We can leave the carcass here for the time being. With luck, no one will discover it until after Quenthel\u0027s death.\" Either the other conspirators believed her explanation, or, more likely, didn\u0027t care that she\u0027d murdered the teacher. A few congratulated her on her finesse, and, utterly indifferent to the corpse sprawled in their midst, resumed their departures. Drisinil picked up and examined the fallen falchion. Once Quenthel was slain, it ought to look nice on her wall. Faeryl prowled the rounded, treacherous surfaces at the apex of the ambassadorial residence. She was trying to monitor all four sides of her home, which entailed clambering about with a certain celerity. Yet she was also trying to hide from anyone who might be peering from the window of a neighboring mansion or up from one of the quiet residential boulevards of prosperous West Wall, and the faster she moved, the more problematic stealth became. She\u0027d sneaked up there two hours ago, when everyone else thought she was bundling or burning documents, and she still wasn\u0027t sure she\u0027d struck the proper balance between the two necessities. She wished she could have ordered a retainer or two up there to help her keep her vigil, but it would have been ill-advised, considering that any of her minions might be the object of her hunt. She also wished she had more cover. Except for a few token walkways and crenellations so small as to be essentially ornamental, the apex of the stalagmite keep was bare of fortifications or even level places to stand. If Faeryl looked closely, she could see subtle signs that at one time, when the keep had served another purpose, such defenses had existed in abundance, but subsequently, a wizard had melted the ramparts back into the rest of the calcite. It made sense. The Menzoberranyr would see no reason to gift an outsider with any notable capacity to resist a siege. Faeryl perched on the northeast side of the roof. Outlined in blue, green, or violet phosphorescence, the homes of her wealthier neighbors glowed all around her. Had she looked from a distance, she would have observed her own residence shining in the same way. Fortunately, the luminescence only defined the silhouette of the tower and picked out several spiders sculpted in bas-relief. As long as she stayed away from the images, kept silent, and enjoyed a measure of luck, it shouldn\u0027t reveal her presence. A soft, indefinable sound rose from the northwest. Grateful that she at least still had the brooch that would make her weightless, she scuttled quickly along the sloping pitch of the roof, fearless in the knowledge that even if she lost her footing, she needn\u0027t fall. In a few seconds, she reached the northwest aspect. She peered over the drop and discovered the source of the sound in the plaza below. Bare to the waist, rapiers in one hand and parrying daggers in the other, two males circled one another. They stood straight and stepped lightly in the manner of well-trained fencers. Their discardedpiwafwis, mail, and shirts lay where they\u0027d tossed them on the ground along with a pair of empty wineskins. A third male looked on from beneath an overhanging balcony some distance away, where the combatants quite possibly hadn\u0027t noticed him. Faeryl sighed. This little tableau was mildly intriguing, but it clearly had nothing to do with her own situation. After her frustrating interview with Matron Mother Baenre, she\u0027d realized she had an opponent. Someone who\u0027d traduced her, possibly to keep her from departing Menzoberranzan, though she couldn\u0027t imagine why. From that inference, it was a small step to the suspicion that the enemy had an agent inside her household. It was what any intelligent foe would try to arrange, and it arguably explained how Faeryl\u0027s intention to go home had been discerned and countered with a word in Triel\u0027s ear. Seething with the need to outwit those who had made a fool of her, Faeryl devised a ruse to unmask the spy. She surprised her retainers with the order to pack. They were slipping out of Menzoberranzan that very night. She thought her loyal vassals would obey, but the traitor would try to sneak away to report the household\u0027s imminent flight. Crouched on the roof, Faeryl would spot her when she did. That was the plan, anyway. The ambassador could think of several reasons why it might fail. The residence had means of egress on all four sides, but she couldn\u0027t survey all four at once, not unless she floated well above the roof, and that option presented problems of its own. Most dark elf boots possessed a virtue of silence, and their mantles, one of obscuration. The traitor might even have some more potent means of escaping notice, such as a talisman of invisibility. Were she any higher above the ground, Faeryl might have no hope at all of detecting the spy\u0027s surreptitious exit. Of course, the traitor might also have a means of communicating with her confederates via clairaudience, or a charm of instantaneous transit, in which case the envoy\u0027s scheme was doomed no matter what. She\u0027d cling to the roof until someone in authority, a company of Baenre guards, perhaps, showed up to take her and her entourage into custody, but she\u0027d had to try something. She crawled on. Below and behind her, one of the duelists groaned as his foe\u0027s blade plunged through his torso. Magic flickered and sizzled, and the victor dropped as well. The wizard who\u0027d been watching from a distance strolled forward to inspect the steaming corpses. Faeryl wondered if the three had been siblings, and the wizard was the clever one. She\u0027d had a brother like that once, until an even trickier male turned him to dust and absconded with his wands and grimoires. A minor setback for her House, but interesting to watch. Overhead, something snapped. She glanced up. Four or five riders on wyvern-back were winging their way east. Above them, projecting from the cavern ceiling, the stalactite castles shone with their own enchantments, a far lovelier sight, in her opinion, than the miniscule monochromatic stars that speckled the night sky of the so-called Lands of Light. Then, so faintly that she wondered if she\u0027d imagined it, something brushed against something else. The sound had issued from the southwest. Faeryl scurried over to that part of the roof and peered down. At first glance, nothing appeared changed since the last time she\u0027d checked that way. Perhaps her nerves were playing tricks on her, but she kept on looking anyway. Octagonal steel grilles protected the round windows cut in the wall below her, but if a drow knew the trick, she could unlatch one and swing it aside for an entrance or exit via levitation. Apparently, someone had, for after a few more moments, Faeryl noticed that one of the web-pattern shields hung ever so slightly ajar. With that sign to guide her, she spotted the shrouded figure skulking toward the mouth of an alleyway. The noble of Ched Nasad was a fair hand with a crossbow. She might have been able to shoot down the traitor from behind, but that would gain her few answers. She didn\u0027t happen to possess a scroll with the spell for interrogating the dead. She needed to catch up with the spy and take the wretch alive. She read from a scroll she did have, then she stepped away from the top of the tower into empty space. Except that it wasn\u0027t empty for her. The air was as firm as stone beneath her soles. For two paces, she strode on a level surface, and, because she willed it so, the unseen platform dipped into an equally invisible ramp. She sprinted down with no fear of blundering off the edge. Wherever she set her foot, the incline would be there to meet it. That was how the magic worked. Her progress entirely silent, she dashed unnoticed above the traitor\u0027s head, then with a thought dissolved the support beneath her boots. Her crossbow ready, she dropped the last few feet to the ground and landed infront of the spy. Started, the traitor jumped. Faeryl felt her own pang of surprise, for though she liked to think she maintained a proper suspicion of everyone, in truth, she never could have guessed the pinched, sour face she saw half hidden inside the close-drawn cowl could be the spy\u0027s. \"Umrae,\" the ambassador said, aiming her hand crossbow. \"My lady,\" the secretary answered, bending with her usual stiffness into an obeisance. \"I know all about it, traitor. I\u0027m not actually planning to leave tonight. My pretending so was a trick to see who would slip away to play informer.\" \"I don\u0027t know what you mean. I just wanted to buy some items for the journey. I thought that if I hurried over to the Bazaar, I could find one of those merchants who stays open late and be back before anyone missed me.\" \"Doyou think I haven\u0027t realized I have an enemy here in Menzoberranzan, someone with access to Matron Baenre? Two tendays ago, Triel considered me loyal. She approved of me. She granted a good deal of what I asked on behalf of our people. Now, she doubts me, because someone has persuaded her to question my true intentions. What did my foe offer to lure you to her side? Don\u0027t you realize that in betraying me, you betray Ched Nasad itself?\" The scribe hesitated, then said, \"Matron Baenre has people watching the residence. Someone is watching us right now.\" \"Perhaps,\" Faeryl replied. Umrae swallowed. \"So you can\u0027t harm me. Or they\u0027ll harm you.\" Faeryl laughed. \"Rubbish. Triel\u0027s agents won\u0027t reveal their presence just to keep me from disciplining one of my own retainers. They won\u0027t see anything odd or detrimental to Menzoberranzan\u0027s interests in that. Now, be sensible and surrender.\" After another pause, Umrae said, \"Give me your word you won\u0027t hurt me. That you\u0027ll set me free and help me flee the city.\" \"I promise you nothing except that your insolence is making me angrier by the second, and a quick capitulation is your only hope. Tell me, who turned you, and why? What does anyone hereabouts have to gain by persecuting an envoy, one who stands apart from the feuds and rivalries among the Menzoberranyr Houses?\" \"You must understand, I fear to betray them and remain. They\u0027ll kill me if I do.\" \"They won\u0027t get the chance. I\u0027m the one pointing a poisoned dart at you. Who are your employers?\" \"I won\u0027t say, not without your pledge.\" \"Your friend didn\u0027t slander me to Triel until after I started contemplating a return to Ched Nasad. Was that the point of the lie? To keep me from venturing out into the Underdark? Why?\" Umrae shook her head. \"You\u0027re mad,\" Faeryl said. \"Why would you condemn yourself to perpetuate someone else\u0027s existence? Ah well, you\u0027re plainly unfit to live, so I suppose it\u0027s for the best.\" She made a show of sighting down the length of the crossbow. \"No!\" Umrae cried. \"Don\u0027t! You\u0027re right, why should I die?\" \"If you answer my questions, perhaps you won\u0027t.\" \"Yes.\" Trembling a little, her nerve having been broken, the clerk raised her hand to her face, perhaps to massage her brow. No - to lift a tiny vial to her lips! Faeryl pulled the trigger and her aim was true, but by the time the quarrel pierced Umrae\u0027s stomach, the secretary\u0027s form was changing. She grew even thinner, shriveling, but taller as well. Her flesh cooled and stank of corruption, leathery wings sprouted from her shoulder blades, and her eyes sank into her head. Even her garments altered, blurring and splitting into moldering rags. No blood flowed from the wound the poisoned dart had made, and it didn\u0027t seem to inconvenience her in the slightest. She didn\u0027t even bother to pull the missile out. Faeryl was furious at herself for allowing Umrae to trick her. Next time, she\u0027d remember that even a dark elf devoid of beauty, grace, and facile wit, seemingly undone by fear, was yet a drow, born to guile and deception. The potion had temporarily transformed Umrae into some sort of undead, in which form she likely wouldn\u0027t suffer at all from her usual clumsiness. Had Lolth not forsaken her priestesses, Faeryl might have controlled the cadaverous thing with her clerical powers, but that was no longer an option. Nor were any of her other retainers likely to notice her plight and dash to her rescue. She had them all too busy packing up the house. It was unfortunate, because like most undead, except for the lowly corpses and skeletons spellcasters reanimated to serve as mindless thralls, Umrae in winged-ghoul form could probably do grievous harm with any strike that so much as grazed the skin, and Faeryl didn\u0027t even have a shield to fend her off. How was she to know the spy would possess such a potent means of defense? Umrae took a shambling step, then, with a clap of her wings, bounded forward. Faeryl hastily retreated, dropped the useless crossbow, and opened the clasp of her cloak. Pulling the garment off her shoulders with one hand, she unsheathed a little adamantine rod with the other. At a snap of her wrist, the harmless-looking object swelled into Mother\u0027s Kiss, the long-hafted, basalt-headed warhammer the females of House Zauvirr had borne since the founding of their line. Perhaps an enchanted weapon would slay Umrae where the envenomed quarrel had failed. Faeryl would have to hope so. Even if she were willing to stand meekly aside and let the traitor fly away, Umrae, her thoughts perhaps colored by the predatory guise she\u0027d assumed, plainly wanted a fight, and the envoy could see no way to evade her. It would be stupid to evoke darkness and run. In undead form, Umrae would likely manage better in the murk than its maker did. It would be even more pointless to try to levitate or ascend through the use of the air-walking charm when the shapeshifter could simply spread her ragged wings and follow. Faeryl waved herpiwafwi back and forth at the end of her extended arm, to confuse Umrae and serve as some semblance of a shield. No one had ever taught Faeryl to fight thusly, but she\u0027d observed warriors practicing the technique, and she tried to believe that if mere males could do it, it would surely present no difficulty to a high priestess. Umrae lunged, Faeryl lashed the cloak in a horizontal arc. Possibly thanks to luck as much as skill, the garment blocked Umrae\u0027s hands. Her talons snagged in the weave. Surprised, Umrae faltered in the attack and struggled to free her hands. Faeryl stepped through and smashed the pointed stone head of her hammer into the center of the servant\u0027s carious brow. Bone crunched, and Umrae\u0027s head snapped backward. A goodly portion of her left profile fell off her skull. Certain the fight was over, Faeryl relaxed, and that was nearly the end of her. Transformed, Umrae could evidently endure more damage than almost any creature with warm flesh and a beating heart. She opened her mouth, exposing long, thin fangs, and what was left of her head shot forward over the top of the cape. The ambassador only barely managed to fling herself back out of the way in time. Thepiwafwi was stretched taut between the two combatants, as if they were playing tug-of-war. Both yanked on it simultaneously, and Faeryl was the luckier. The cloak tore freeof Umrae\u0027s grasp, but despite the garment\u0027s reinforcing enchantments, it returned to the ambassador with long rips the ghoul\u0027s claws had cut. A few more such rendings and it would be useless. The capes sudden release also sent Faeryl stumbling backward. With another beat of her festering wings, Umrae hopped and closed the distance. Her clawed hands shot forward. Crying out in desperation, Faeryl managed to plant her feet and arrest her helpless stagger. She lashed out with the hammer and clipped one of Umraes hands. The imitation ghoul snatched it back and gave up the attack. Instead, she began to circle.Just as a living creature would, she shook her battered extremity several times as if to dislodge the pain, then lifted it back on guard. Faeryl turned to keep the foe with her crushed, half-flayed head in view. What is it going to take to stop this thing? the ambassador wondered,Can I stop it? Yes, curse it! When she was a child, her cousin Merinid, weapons master of House Zauvirr, dead these many years since her mother tired of him, had told her that any opponent could be destroyed. It was just a matter of finding the vulnerable spot. Umrae lunged. Once again, the ambassador snapped out the folds of her frail, flapping shield. The cloak entangled one of the servant\u0027s hands. The other raked, rasping and snagging, across Faeryl\u0027s coat of fine adamantine links. The winged ghoul\u0027s touch sowed cramping sickness in its wake, but the claws hadn\u0027t quite sheared through the sturdy mail, and the sensation only lasted an instant. Faeryl swung at Umrae\u0027s withered chest in its covering of filthy, crumbling cloth. If she couldn\u0027t slay the ghoul-thing with a strike to the head, then the heart must be the vulnerable spot, just as with a vampire. Or at least she hoped so. To her surprise, Umrae denied her the chance to find out one way or the other. It looked as if the traitor had so committed to her attack that she would find it impossible to defend against a riposte. Yet she interposed her withered arm to take the shock of the warhammer, then stooped to claw at Faeryl\u0027s unarmored knee. The envoy avoided that potentially crippling attack with a fast retreat, meanwhile ripping the cloak away from her foul-smelling adversary. The garment was starting to look more like a bunch of ribbons than one coherent piece of silk. The duelists resumed circling, each looking for an opening. Occasionally Faeryl let the tatteredpiwafwi slip or droop out of line, offering an invitation, but Umrae proved too canny to attack when and how her opponent wished her to. Faeryl realized she was panting and did the best to control her breathing. She wasn\u0027t afraid - shewasn\u0027t - but she was impressed with her servant\u0027s potion-induced prowess. Formidable from the moment she imbibed it, Umrae was truly getting the hang of her borrowed capabilities as the battle progressed. While still maneuvering and keeping an eye on Umrae, Faeryl nevertheless entered a light trance. With a sense that was neither sight, hearing, nor any faculty comprehensible to those who\u0027d never pledged her service to a deity, she reached into that formless yet somehow jagged place where she had once been accustomed to touch the shadow of the goddess. The presence of Lolth had absented itself from the meeting ground, leaving a vacancy that somehow throbbed like a diseased tooth. Still, it seemed an appropriate domain in which to pray. Dread Queen of Spiders, Faeryl silently began, I beg you, reveal yourself to me. Restore my powers, even if only for a moment. Has Menzoberranzan offended you? So be it, but I\u0027m not one of her daughters. I\u0027m from Ched Nasad. Make me as I was, and I\u0027ll give you many lives - a slave every day for a year. Nothing happened. Umrae sprang in, clawing. Faeryl jerked the part of her spirit that had groped in the void back into her body. Retreating, she blocked the undead creature\u0027s claws with her cloak and struck a couple blows with the warhammer. She didn\u0027t withdraw quickly enough to take herself completely out of harm\u0027s way, nor did she settle into a strong stance and swing as hard as she could have. She wanted the ghoul to feel on the brink of overwhelming her opponent and keep coming. If Umrae grew too eager, she might open herself up for an effective counterattack. Umrae\u0027s talons whizzed through the air, tearing scraps from the sheltering cloak until it was the size of a ragged hand towel. Unexpectedly, the spy beat her riddled wings, hopped in close, and struck at Faeryl\u0027s face. The noble recoiled, but even so the claws streaked past a fraction of an inch before her eyes, so close she could feel the malignancy inside them as a pulse of headache. Still, it was all right, because she thought Umrae was finally open. She sidestepped and swung her stone-headed hammer at the ghoul\u0027s rib cage - to no avail, even though Faeryl had been correct, Umrae couldn\u0027t swing her hands around in time to block the blow. Instead, she took another stride, slapped the ambassador with a flick of her wing, and sent her reeling. Faeryl\u0027s head rang, and the world blurred. As she struggled to throw off the stunning effects of the blow, she thought fleetingly how unfair it was that Umrae, who had long ago forsaken combat training as a humiliating exercise in futility, was demolishing a female who still doggedly reported to her captain-of-the-guard for practice once a tenday. After what seemed a long time, her head cleared. She whirled, certain that Umrae was about to attack her from behind. She wasn\u0027t. In fact, the animate corpse was nowhere to be seen. Plainly, Umrae had taken to the air. Had she finally done the sensible thing and fled? Faeryl couldn\u0027t believe it. Umrae hated her. The envoy didn\u0027t know why, but she\u0027d seen it in the traitor\u0027s eyes. Such being the case, Umrae wouldn\u0027t break off when she had every reason to believe she was winning and close to making the kill. No drow would, which meant she was still hovering somewhere overhead, poised to swoop down and, she undoubtedly hoped, catch her mistress by surprise and smash her to the ground. Her heart pounding, Faeryl peered upward and saw nothing. She listened for the beat of the creature\u0027s wings but heard only the eternal muffled whisper of the city as a whole. She wasn\u0027t entirely surprised. The undead were famously stealthy when stalking their prey. A black sliver momentarily cut the line of violet luminescence adorning a spire of the castle of House Vandree. The obstruction had surely been the tip of one of Umrae\u0027s wings. Faeryl stared for another moment, then jumped when she finally spotted Umrae. Her tattered cloak flapping between her wings, the transformed secretary was already hurtling down like a raptor from the World Above diving to plunge its talons into a rodent. Hoping Umrae hadn\u0027t seen her react to the sight of her, Faeryl kept turning and peering. When she felt the disturbance in the air, or perhaps simply the urgent prompting of her instincts, she jumped aside, pivoted, and swung the warhammer in an overhand blow. Under those circumstances, she had little chance of smashing the thing\u0027s heart, but she\u0027d seen that Umrae could suffer pain. Perhaps the initial blow would freeze the undead thing in place for an instant, affording Faeryl the opportunity for what she prayed would be the finishing stroke. The ambassador had timed the move properly, and the weapon\u0027s basalt head smashed into Umrae\u0027s flank. Deprived of her victim, unexpectedly battered, the ghoul slammed into the smooth stone surface of the street with a satisfying crash. Scraps of flesh broke away from her raddled body, releasing a fresh puff of stench. Faeryl marked her target, the place on Umrae\u0027s chest beneath which her heart ought to lie, and swung Mother\u0027s Kiss back for the follow-up attack. The traitor rolled and scrambled to her knees. Faeryl struck, and Umrae lashed out with a taloned hand. The ghoul caught the warhammer in mid-flight, tore it out of the ambassador\u0027s grip, and sentit spinning to clack down on the ground ten feet away. Faeryl felt a crazy impulse to turn and go after the thing, but she knew Umrae would rip her apart if she tried. She backstepped instead. The inhumanly gaunt spy leaped to her feet - she looked like a pile of sticks spontaneously assembling themselves into a crude facsimile of a person - and pursued. While retreating, Faeryl started edging around in a looping course that might ultimately bring her to the spot where the hammer lay. Leering, Umrae moved sideways right along with her in a way that demonstrated she knew exactly what her mistress had in mind and would never permit it. Well, the aristocrat still had one weapon - pitifully inadequate to the situation though it was - a knife hidden in the belt that gathered her light, supple coat of mail at the waist. The gold buckle was the hilt, and when she pulled on it, the stubby adamantine blade would slide free. She started to reach for it, then hesitated. Against Umrae\u0027s talons, long reach, and resistance to harm, the dagger really would be useless . . . unless Faeryl could get in close enough to use it, and unless she attacked by surprise. But how in the name of the Demonweb was she to accomplish that? Umrae was rapidly closing the distance, snapping her wings every few steps to lengthen a stride, and for three unnerving backward paces, Faeryl\u0027s mind was blank. Then she remembered the cloak, or rather, the remnants of it, still clutched in her offhand. Perhaps she could employ it to conceal her drawing of the knife. Thepiwafwi was just a sad little mass of tatters, and she was no juggler adept at sleight-of-hand, but curse it, if clumsy Umrae had palmed a potion vial without her mistress noticing until it was too late, surely the mistress could do as well. Faeryl had been reflexively moving the cloak around the whole time, so it shouldn\u0027t look suspicious for her to cover her waist with it. At the same time, she hooked the fingers of her weapon hand in the oval hollow at the center of the buckle and pulled. She had never before had occasion to employ this last desperate means of defense, but in the sixteen years since an artisan had made it to her specifications, she had always kept the knife and scabbard oiled, and the blade easily slid free. She studied Umrae. As far as the envoy could tell, the imitation ghoul hadn\u0027t seen her bare the dagger, but she doubted she could keep it hidden for more than a second or two. She had to manufacture a chance for herself quickly if she was to have one at all. She pretended to stumble. She hoped her unsteadiness looked genuine. Umrae had touched her, after all, so it might seem credible that her strength was failing. The ghoul took the bait. She leaped forward and seized Faeryl by the forearms. This time, her claws punched through the envoy\u0027s layer of mail and jabbed their tips into her flesh. At once, a surge of nausea wracked Faeryl, then another. Retching, she wasn\u0027t sure she could still use the knife in any sort of controlled manner. Perhaps she\u0027d just served herself up to her foe like a plate of mushrooms. Umrae grinned at Faeryl\u0027s seeming - or genuine - helplessness. The envoy felt the clerk\u0027s fingers tense, preparing to flense the meat from her bones, even as she pulled the noble closer and opened her jaws to bite down on her head. Fighting the sickness and weakness, Faeryl tried to thrust her hand forward. The effort strained her flesh against the ghoul\u0027s talons, tearing her wounds larger and bringing a burst of pain - but then her arm jerked free. The blade rammed into Umrae\u0027s withered chest, slipping cleanly between two ribs and plunging in all the way up to Faeryl\u0027s knuckles. Umrae convulsed and threw back her head for a silent scream. The spasms jerked her hands and threatened to rip Faeryl apart even without the traitor\u0027s conscious intent. Umrae froze, and toppled backward, carrying her assailant with her. In contradiction of every tale Faeryl had ever heard, the shapeshifter didn\u0027t revert to her original form when true death claimed her. Still horribly sick, the envoy lay for some time in the ghoul\u0027s fetid embrace. Eventually, however, she mustered the trembling strength to pull free of the claws embedded in her bleeding limbs, after which she crawled a few feet away from the winged corpse. Gradually, despite the sting of her punctures and bruises, she started to feel a little better. Physically, anyway. Inside her mind, she was berating herself for an outcome that wasn\u0027t really a victory at all. Given that she needed to learn what Umrae knew, not kill her, she\u0027d bungled their encounter from the beginning. She supposed she should have agreed to the traitor\u0027s terms, but she\u0027d been too angry and too proud. She should also have spotted the vial and fought more skillfully. If not for luck, it would be she and not her erstwhile scribe lying dead on the stone. She wondered if her sojourn in Menzoberranzan had diminished her. Back in Ched Nasad, she had enemies in- and outside House Zauvirr to keep her strong and sharp, but in the City of Spiders none had wished her ill. Had she forgotten the habits that protected her for her first two hundred years of life? If so, she knew she\u0027d better remember them quickly. The enemy hadn\u0027t finished with her. She wasn\u0027t so dull and rusty that she didn\u0027t recall how these covert wars unfolded.It was like asava game, progressing a step at a time, gradually escalating in ferocity. Her unknown adversary\u0027s first move, though she hadn\u0027t known it at the time, had been to turn Umrae and lie to Triel. Faeryl\u0027s countermove was to capture the spy and remove her from the board. As soon as Umrae missed some prearranged rendezvous, the foe would know her pawn had been taken and advance another piece. Perhaps it would be the mother. Perhaps the foe would suggest to Matron Baenre that the time had come to throw Faeryl in a dungeon. But life wasn\u0027t really asava game. Faeryl could cheat and make two moves in a row, which in this instance meant truly fleeing Menzoberranzan as soon as possible, before the enemy learned of her agents demise. Light-headed and sour-mouthed from her exertions, Faeryl dragged herself to her feet, trudged in search of Mother\u0027s Kiss, and wondered just how she would accomplish that little miracle.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dissolution-war-of-the-spider-queen-1/page-9.html","bookId":2159,"book":{"id":2159,"title":"Dissolution (War of the Spider Queen #1)","description":"Storyline: Dissolution (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
