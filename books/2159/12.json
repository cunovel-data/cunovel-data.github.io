{"id":97636,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"When Quenthel had decided she must don armor, she had performed the task as methodically as she did everything else. She\u0027d put on a cunningly crafted adamantine gorget, a Baenre heirloom, beneath her chain mail andpiwafwi, and it was likely that protective collar that saved her life. Still, the unexpected impact on the nape of her neck knocked her forward and down onto one knee, and the edge of her enchanted buckler clanked against the floor. For a moment, she was dazed. The whip vipers hissed and clamored to rouse her, their outburst clashing with the jumbled howling of the advancing chaos demon. She felt something hanging down her back and bade the serpents pull it off. Hsiv reared over her shoulder, tugged the article out of the mail links and cloth with his jaws, and displayed it for her inspection. She recognized it from the armory. It was an enchanted quarrel sized for a two-hand arbalest, and if it, or one like it, so much as pricked a dark elf\u0027s skin, it would almost certainly kill. Quenthel thought her assailant had had just about enough time to reload. If so, the Baenre obviously couldn\u0027t trust her cloak and mail to protect her - the first bolt had pierced them easily enough. Though it meant turning her back on the demon, she wrenched herself around, remaining on one knee to make a smaller target, and did her best to cover herself with her tiny shield. Just in time. A second quarrel cracked against the armor. A shadowy but recognizably female figure ducked back into an arched doorway, no doubt to ready her weapon again. Trapped between two foes, Quenthel thought that if she didn\u0027t eliminate one of them quickly, they were almost certainly going to kill her. Judging her sister dark elf the easier mark, she leveled a long, thin rod at her. A glob of seething green vitriol materialized in the air before her, then shot toward her enemy. Quenthel could just see the edge of her opponent\u0027s body in the recessed space, and that was what she aimed for. Even if she missed, the magic ought to slow the assassin down. The green mass clipped her foe\u0027s shoulder. It exploded, and the dark figure jumped. The stonework around her was covered in a sticky mass of something like glue. Quenthel smiled, but her foe, apparently unhindered by the entrapping magic, returned to the task of cocking the crossbow. Something, her innate drow resistance to hostile magic, perhaps, had shielded her from harm. Quenthel glanced over her shoulder as she slipped the rod back into her belt. Though moving at a leisurely pace, the chaos demon had already traversed more than half of the lengthy gallery, and of course its speed could increase at any moment, just as every other aspect of its being altered unpredictably from one second to the next. But if the Spider Queen favored Quenthel and the entity didn\u0027t accelerate, she might have time for another strike at her foe of flesh and blood. Silently directing the vipers to keep an eye on the demon, she turned back, and read from a precious scroll. When Quenthel pronounced the last syllable, the scroll disappeared in a puff of dust and a brilliant light filled the chamber. The dark elf in the doorway reeled and clutched blindly at the door frame. She touched the slowly-dripping mass of glue and snatched her fingers away, leaving skin behind. Quenthel started to read another scroll as the air around her stirred, blowing one direction then another. Hot one second and cold the next, the gusts wafted countless smells, pleasant and foul alike. She took it for a sign that the demon had drawn very close, and the vipers\u0027 warning confirmed it. Still, she wanted tofinish her lesser adversary off before the girl recovered her sight. She completed the spell, the exquisitely inked characters burning through the parchment like hot coals. From the elbow down, the enemy female\u0027s left arm rippled and swelled, becoming an enormous black spider with green markings on its bristling back. Still attached to the rest of her body, it lunged at her throat and plunged its mandibles in. Quenthel spun around. Mauve with golden spots, then white, then half red and half blue, the demon loomed over her. Most of the time it looked flat, like a hole into some other luminous, turbulent universe, and an observer had only its inconstant outline from which to infer its shape. Over the course of a couple seconds, it seemed to become an enormous crab claw, a wagon complete with driver, and a whirling dust devil. The length of gallery behind it resembled a tunnel carved from melting rainbow-colored slush except for one little stretch. That section appeared unchanged until Quenthel noticed that the carvings had flipped upside down. The high priestess scrambled to her feet. As she rooted in her bag for another scroll, her scourge dangled from her wrist. The vipers writhed and twisted. The chaos demon blinked from ochre to a pattern of black and white stripes, and from the form of a simple isosceles triangle to that of an ogre. Its cry currently a mix of roaring and cawing, it swung its newly acquired club. Quenthel caught the blow on her buckler. To her surprise, she didn\u0027t feel the slightest shock, but the shield turned blue, changed from round to rectangular, and became many times heavier than it had been before. The unexpected weight dragged her down to the floor again. Resembling a cresting wave, the intruder flowed toward her. She yanked, but her shield arm was caught somehow and wouldn\u0027t pull free of the straps. Rippling from magenta to brown stippled with scarlet, the demon advanced to within inches of her foot. Quenthel\u0027s boot evaporated into wisps of vapor, and pain stabbed through the extremity. Finally her hand jerked out of its restraints, and she flung herself backward, rolling, her mail whispering against the floor. When she\u0027d put sufficient distance between herself and her foe, she rose, then faltered. For an instant, she couldn\u0027t locate the fiend, and her mind struggled to make sense of the scene before her. Green and blue, shaped like an hourglass, the demon was gliding along the ceiling, not the floor. It was still pursuing her. The cursed thing was random in every respect save its doggedly murderous intent. The entity\u0027s howl ceased for a moment, then resumed with a peal of childish laughter. Quenthel snatched and unrolled a scroll, which abruptly turned into a rothe\u0027s jawbone. The air took on a sooty tinge, and her next breath seared her lungs. Choking, she stumbled back out of the cloud. She could breathe, though the stinging heat in her throat and chest persisted. She suspected that, had she inhaled any more of it, the taint might well have killed her. As it was, it had incapacitated and possibly slain the vipers, who hung inert from the buttof the whip. She tossed away the jawbone, grabbed another scroll, and started reading the powerful spell contained therein. Shaped like some hybrid of dragon and wolf, the demon, back on the floor again, advanced without moving its legs. Though colored the blue and gold of flame, it threw off a bitter chill that threatened to freeze the skin on her face and spoil her recitation with a stammer. Quenthel thanked the goddess that her own education in Arach-Tinilith had taught her to transcend discomfort. She forced out the words in the proper manner, and a black blade, like a greatsword without a guard, hilt, or tang, shimmered into existence in front of her. She smiled. The floating weapon was a devastating magic known only to the priestesses of Lolth. Quenthel had never seen any creature resist it. Though the stone floor was still chilly against the sole of her bare foot, the ghastly cold had passed, and she stood her ground, the blade interposed between her and her pursuer. \"Do you know what this is?\" she asked it. \"It can kill you. It can kill anything.\" Certain the demon could hear her thoughts, she sent it the words,Surrender and tell me who sent you, or I\u0027ll slice you to pieces. Emitting a sweet scent she\u0027d never encountered before, looking like a giant frog crudely chiseled from mica with rows of wicked fangs in its sparkling jaws, the chaos demon waddled forward. Fine,the Baenre thought,be stupid. Controlling the black blade with her thoughts, she bade it attack. It hacked a long gash in the top of the frog head and knocked the demon down on its belly. The edges of the wound burned with scarlet fire. The intruder turned inky black while flowing into a shape that resembled two dozen hands growing on long, leafy stalks. The stems stretching and twisting, the creature grabbed for the sword. Quenthel let the hands seize hold of it, and as she\u0027d expected, the magically keen double edge cut them to pieces, which dropped away onto the floor. The demon gave a particularly loud cry, which sounded in part like the rhythmic clanging of a hammer beating metal in a forge. Wincing at the noise, the priestess didn\u0027t know if the extreme volume equated to a scream of pain, but she hoped so. The demon turned into a miniature green tower shaped according to the uncouth architectural notions of some inferior race. A force surrounding it tugged at the sword as if the keep were a magnet and the conjured weapon, forged of steel. Quenthel found it easy to compensate for the pull. She slashed away chunks of masonry. The tower opened lengthwise like a sarcophagus. It lurched forward, swallowed the sword, and closed up again. The entity had caught Quenthel by surprise, but she didn\u0027t see why it should matter. It might even be more effective to cut and stab her foe from the inside. She used the blade to thrust, felt the point bite, and her psionic link with the weapon snapped. Startled, she nonetheless reflexively reached for another scroll. The demon spread out into a low, squirming red and yellow mass. A hole dilated in the midst of it, and it spat the sword out. The weapon retained its shape but rippled with shifting colors just as the intruder did, and Quenthel still couldn\u0027t feel it with her mind. She backed away, the blade followed, and, rattling and growling, the demon brought up the rear. The sword swept back and forth, up and down, while she ducked and dodged. So far, she was evading it, but it hampered and hurt her simply by being near. Her mail turned to moss and crumbled away. Her flesh throbbed with sudden pains as the demon\u0027s power sought to transform it. One leg turned numb and immobile for a second, and she nearly fell. Itchy scales grew on her skin then faded away. Her eyes ached, the world blurred to black, white, and gray, and the colors exploded back into view. Her identity itself was in flux. For one instant, she thought the thoughts and felt the soft, alien emotions of an arthritic human seamstress dwelling somewhere in the World Above. Somehow, despite all such disconcerting phenomena, she managed to read the spell on the scroll and avoid the radiant blade at the same time. She wasn\u0027t sure how this particular parchment had found its way to Arach-Tinilith. She questioned that a dark elf had scribed it, for it contained a spell that few drow ever cast. Indeed, some priestesses would disdain to cast it, because it invoked a force regarded as anathema to their faith. But Quenthel knew the goddess would want her to use any weapon necessary to vanquish her foe, and it was remotely possible that this magic would prevail where even the supposedly invincible black blade had failed. Bright, intricate harmonies sang from the empty air. A field of bluish phosphorescence sprang up around her. Within it, she could make out intangible geometric forms revolving around one another in complex symmetrical patterns. The cool radiance expressed the power of order, of law, the antithesis of chaos. The sword that had become an extension of the demon\u0027s will froze inside it like an insect in amber - and the demon was equally still. For a moment, at least. The creature began hitching ever so slightly forward, working itself loose of the restricting magic. The Mistress of Arach-Tinilith was essentially a creature of chaos as well, but mortal and native to the material plane, and thus the spell had no power over her. She wheeled and dashed to the body lying in the doorway. Only the spider part of it was moving, chewing and slurping on the rest. The dead girl turned out to be Halavin Symryvvin, who\u0027d had the surprisingly good sense to remove all that gaudy, clinking jewelry before attempting to attack by surprise. The novice had managed the arbalest rather deftly, considering her sore, mutilated hands. Quenthel stooped to pick up the weapon and the quiver containing the rest of the enchanted quarrels. She moved warily, but the feasting arachnid paid her no mind. She turned, laid a dart in the channel, and shot. When the shaft hit it, the demon shuddered in its nearly immobile form, but didn\u0027t die. It occurred to her that she could get away from it while it was trapped, muster any loyal minions who hadn\u0027t partaken of the poisoned supper, and fight the thing at the head of a company, just as she\u0027d originally intended. After the harrowing events of the past minutes, the idea had a certain appeal. But after what she\u0027d endured, she wanted to be the one to teach this vermin alesson about molesting the clergy of Lolth. Besides, the appearance of strength was vital. So she kept shooting as fast as the cocking action of the weapon would allow. The demon inched its way toward her as if it was made of half-cooled magma. Four bolts left, then three. She pulled the trigger, the dart struck the demon in the middle of its horned, triangular head, and it winked out of existence. She could still hear its voice, but knew that was just because it had shrieked so long and loudly. She gave her head a shake, trying to quell the phantom sound, then glimpsed yet another shadow watching her from some distance away. \"You!\" she shouted, cocking the arbalest to receive the penultimate quarrel. \"Come here!\" The other dark elf bolted. Quenthel gave chase, but she was still a little winded from the struggle with the demon, and her quarry outdistanced her and disappeared. The Baenre stalked on through the labyrinthine chambers and corridors until she rounded a bend and came face to face with three of her minions. The goddess only knew what their true sentiments were, but confronted with her leveled arbalest and the obvious fact that, while her gear was much the worse for wear, she herself was unscathed, they hastily saluted. \"I killed tonight\u0027s intruder,\" she said, \"and a homegrown enemy as well. What do you know of our situation? Is anyone else dead?\" \"No, Mistress,\" said a priestess. The lowered visor of her spider-crested helmet completely concealed her features, but from her voice, Quenthel recognized Quave, one of the senior instructors. \"Most of those who ate and drank the tainted meal are waking. I think the poisoner only wanted to render us unconscious, not kill us.\" \"Apparently,\" said Quenthel, \"she was willing to let the demon administer the coup de grace to me. What of those who encountered the entity before I did?\" Quave hesitated, then said, \"When they tried to hinder it, it hurt them, but not to the point of death. They should recover as well.\" \"Good,\" Quenthel said, though she took no joy in knowing she was the unknown enemy\u0027s sole target. \"What are your orders, Mistress?\" asked Quave. \"We\u0027ll have to sort out the living from the dead, and deal with each accordingly. We\u0027ll also look for the place where the demon got in, and seal it.\" These were tasks that would doubtless keep her occupied for the rest of the night, but she knewshe had to find a way to stop the intrusions, and pull the fangs of another crisis as well. It would all make for an arduous day\u0027s labor, with the outcome uncertain enough to depress even a high priestess. Still, her mood lifted slightly when her vipers began to stir. \"I have a healing potion,\" said Ryld. He took a small pewter vial from his pouch, unstoppered it, and held it to Pharaun\u0027s lips. The wizard drank the liquid down. \"That might be a little better,\" Pharaun said after a moment. \"But it\u0027s still bad. I\u0027m still bleeding. On the inside, too, I think. Do you have any more?\" \"No.\" \"Pity. A wretched little goblin did this. I can\u0027t believe it.\" \"Can you walk?\" asked Ryld. Pharaun would have to move or be moved, somehow. He couldn\u0027t just lie in the street, not in the Braeryn, not on a night when the hunt was out. It was far too dangerous. \"Possibly.\" The mage strained to lift himself up with his hands, then slumped back down. \"But apparently not.\" \"I\u0027ll carry you,\" said Ryld. He gathered the mage in his arms, and bidding Pharaun do the same,called upon the magic of his House insignia. They floated slowly upward, and swung onto a rooftop. The view from that vantage point was far from encouraging. Screaming undercreatures ran through the streets and alleys of the Braeryn with whooping riders in pursuit. The dark elves killed the goblins with the thrust of a lance, the slash of a sword, or simply by trampling them under the clawed feet of their lizards. They tended to find intimate mayhem more amusing. Some, however, had no qualms about loosing a quarrel or conjuring a blast of magic. Still other drow wheeled above the scene on foulwings, wyverns, and other winged mounts. Ryld saw danger on every side. He hauled Pharaun up against a sort of gable in the hope that it would provide cover against the scrutiny of the flyers. \"It\u0027s bad,\" the swordsman said. \"A lot of drow are hunting. There\u0027s no clear path out of the district.\" The wizard didn\u0027t reply. \"Pharaun!\" \"Yes,\" sighed his friend, \"I\u0027m still conscious. Barely.\" \"We\u0027ll hide here until the hunt ends. I\u0027ll covet us with a patch of darkness.\" \"That might w - \" Pharaun gasped and thrashed. Ryld held on to him for fear that he\u0027d roll off the roof. When the seizure ended, the Mizzrym\u0027s face seemed gaunt and drawn in a way it hadn\u0027t been before. More blood seeped from his wounded stomach. \"This isn\u0027t going to work,\" said Ryld, \"not by itself. Unless you have some more healing, you\u0027re going to die.\" \"That would be ... a profound tragedy . . . but . . .\" \"We have plenty of dark elves in the Braeryn tonight. One of them surely brought some restorative magic along. I\u0027ll just have to take it from him, or her. Here\u0027s that darkness.\" Ryld touched the roof and conjured a shadow that covered the Master of Sorcere and not much else. With luck, the effect was localized enough that no one would notice the obscuration itself. The weapons master rose and raced away. Whenever possible, he ran along the rooftops, bounding from one to the next. Often enough, however, the houses were far enough apart that he had to jump down to the ground and skulk his way through the slaughter. It was at such a time that he saw another hunting party.Unfortunately, the group was too large to tackle. He had to hide from it instead. Crouched low, he watched a mage on lizard-back lob a yellow spark through the window of one of the houses. Booming, yellow flame exploded through the room beyond. A moment after it died, the screaming began. Ryld winced. As a child of six, he\u0027d survived precisely such a massacre, and, severely blistered, lain trapped for hours beneath a weight of charred, stinking bodies, the luckier ones dead, the live ones whimpering and twitching in their helpless agony. But it wasn\u0027t him burned nor buried tonight, and he spat the unpleasant memory away. He glanced about, checking to see if anyone was looking at him, then broke from cover and floated upward. He dashed on along a steeply sloping roof engraved with web patterns and defaced, he noticed, with another slave race emblem. He sensed something above and behind him, and pivoted. His boots slipped, and he levitated for an instant while he found his footing amid the carvings. He looked up and spied a huge black horse galloping through the air as easily as the common equines of the World Above could run across a field. Fire crackled around its hooves and pulsed from its nostrils. The dark elf male on its back held a scimitar, but wasn\u0027t making any extraordinary effort to lift it into position for a cut. Apparently he was counting on his demonic steed to make the kill, and why not? What goblinoid could withstand a nightmare? Ryld froze as if he were such a hapless undercreature paralyzed with fear. Meanwhile, he timed the speed of the nightmare\u0027s approach. At the last possible moment, hoping to take the phantom horse and its master by surprise, he whipped Splitter out of its scabbard and cut. And missed. Somehow the demon arrested its charge, and the blade fell short. Its fiery hooves churning eighteen inches above the rooftop, the nightmare snorted. Thick, hot, sulfurous smoke streamed from its nostrils, enveloping Ryld, stinging and half blinding him. He heard more than saw the black creature lunging, striking with its reptilian fangs, and he retreated a step. The move saved him, but when he counterattacked, the nightmare too had taken itself out of range. Through the stinking vapor, he glimpsed the infernal horse circling. It sprang at him again, this time rearing to batter him with its front hooves. He crouched and lifted Splitter. The point took the steed in the chest, and for a moment, he thought he\u0027d disposed of it, but, its legs working frantically, it flew upward, lifting itself off the blade before it could penetrate too deeply. The next few seconds were difficult. Ryld could barely make out his foes,while the nightmare could apparently see through its own smoke perfectly well. He stood and turned precariously on the crest of the roof, in constant danger of losing his balance, whereas the flying horse could maneuver wherever it pleased. Just to make life even more interesting, the rider started swinging his curved sword. Fortunately, like most denizens of the Underdark, he had little notion of how to fight on horseback, but his clumsy strokes still posed a danger. Ryld wanted to end the confrontation quickly, before someone discovered Pharaun\u0027s hiding place. Unfortunately, in light of all his disadvantages, the weapons master thought the only way of doing that was to take a risk. The next time the demon reared, he let one of the blazing hooves slam him in the chest. His dwarven breastplate rang but held. The blow hurt cruelly but didn\u0027t break any ribs or otherwise incapacitate him. He fell backward, banged down on the cast pitch of the roof, and started to tumble. Kicking and scrabbling, negating his weight, he managed to catch himself and twist around into a low fighting stance. The nightmare was rushing in to finish him off. He swung Splitter, and this time the demon was too committed to the attack to halt its forward momentum. The greatsword slashed through its neck, nearly severing the head with its luminous scarlet eyes. The steed toppled sideways and rolled, leaving a trail of embers. The rider tried to jump free, but he was too slow. The nightmare crushed him on its way to the ground. Ryld tore open the dead male\u0027s purse, then floated down to the demon horse and checked the saddlebags. There were no potions or any other means of mending a wound. Why, he wondered, should he expect to find such a thing among the noble\u0027s effects? The noble had come to the Braeryn for some lighthearted sport. He hadn\u0027t believed the goblins couldn\u0027t hurt him or that he was in any other danger, so why bring a remedy for grievous harm to the festivities, even if he was lucky enough to possess one? There were only five hunters who\u0027d come there with a deadly serious purpose, prepared to cross swords with formidable foes: Greyanna and her retainers. They were far more likely to carry healing magic than any other drowwhom Ryld might opt to waylay. Alas, they were likely to prove more trouble as well, but if he wanted to save Pharaun, he\u0027d just have to cope. Pharaun was a useful ally, and Ryld was unwilling to let that carefully nurtured relationship expire easily. He skulked on, ignoring the hunters who obliviously crossed his path, until he finally spied a familiar figure on a rooftopjust ahead of him. Still masked, one of Greyanna\u0027s twin warriors was stalking along that eminence. An arrow nocked, he peered down into the street below. Ryld threw himself down behind a stubby little false minaret on his roof. He peered around it, looking for the rest of the would-be murderers. He didn\u0027t see them. Maybe the band had split up, the better to look for their quarry. They\u0027d have to, wouldn\u0027t they, to oversee the entire district. He ducked back, cocked his hand crossbow and laid a poisoned dart in the channel. He and Pharaun had been reluctant to kill their pursuers, but with the wizard dying, Ryld was no longer overly concerned with a petty retainer\u0027s life. He leaned back around, his finger already tightening on the trigger - and the space where the archer had stood was empty. Ryld cast about, and after a moment spotted the male atop a round, flat-roofed little tower adhering to the main body of the building. That posed two problems. One was that the warrior was farther away and ten feet higher up, at or beyond the limit of the little crossbow\u0027s range. The other was that the male happened to be looking in Ryld\u0027s direction. His eyes flew open wide when he spotted his quarry. Ryld shot, and his dart fell short of the tower. A split second later, the twin pulled back his bowstring and loosed his arrow in one fluid motion. The shaft looked like a gradually swelling dot, which meant it was speeding straight at its target. Ryld dodged back. The arrow whizzed past, and the archer shouted, \"Here! I\u0027ve got him here!\" The weapons master scowled, feeling the pressure of passing time even more acutely than before. He didn\u0027t want to be there when the rest of the enemy arrived, and the only hope of avoiding it was to dispose of his present opponent quickly. The longbow simply had his hand crossbow outclassed. He needed to get in close. He drew Splitter, sprang out into the open, and strode toward his foe. The archer sent one arrow after another winging his way, and he knocked them out of the air. The defense was considerably more difficult advancing across the irregular surface of the roof than it would have been standing still on the ground. Ryld began to sweat, and his heart beat faster, but he was managing. There came another shaft, this one aglitter with some form of enchantment, and he swatted it down. Rattling, it rolled on down the pitch of the roof. He took another step, slapped aside another missile, then heard something - he didn\u0027t know what, just an indefinable change in the sounds around him. He remembered that some enchanters created magical weapons capable of more than flying truer and hitting harder. He spun around. The sparkling arrow had launched itself back into the air and circled around behind him. It was streaking toward its target and was only a few feet from his body. Ryld wrenched Splitter across in a desperate parry. The edge caught the arrow and split it in two. Spinning through the air, the piece with the point hit his shoulder, but, thanks to his armor, did him no harm. He lurched back around with barely enough time to deflect the next shaft, then marched on. Four more paces brought him to the end of the roof. The gap between this house and the next was five yards across. He took a running start, made himself nearly weightless, and jumped. The twin tried to hit when he was in the air, but for a blessed change, his arrow flew wild. Ryld thumped down atop the same structurehis opponent occupied. It felt as if it had taken forever to get this far, even though he knew it had really been less than a minute. Not that he was done running the gauntlet. The arrows kept hurtling at him, including one that gave an eerie scream, filling him with an unnatural fear until he quashed the feeling, and another that turned into a miniature harpy in flight. Yet another struck two paces in front him and exploded into a curtain of fire. Squinting at the glare, he wrapped hispiwafwiaround him and dived through, emerging singed but essentially unscathed. After that, he was close enough to the tower to cancel most of his weight and leap up to the top. He sprang into the air like a jumping spider and alit on the platform. The twin hastily set down his bow and drew his scimitar. \"Do you have any healing magic?\" Ryld asked. \"If so, give it to me, and I\u0027ll let you go.\" The other warrior smiled unpleasantly and said, \"My comrades will start arriving any second. Surrender now, tell me where Pharaun is, and perhaps Princess Greyanna will let you live.\" \"No.\" Ryld cut at the warrior\u0027s head. The other male jumped back out of range, sidestepped, and slashed at the weapons master\u0027s arm. Ryld parried, beat the scimitar aside, and the fight was on. Over the course of the next few seconds, the Mizzrym warrior gave ground consistently. Twice, he nearly stepped off the flat, round tabletop that was the apex of the tower but on both occasions spun himself away from the edge in time. He was a good duelist, and he was fighting defensively while he waited for reinforcements to arrive. That made him hard to hit. Hard, but not impossible. Pressing, Ryld feinted high on the inside to draw the parry, swung his greatsword down and around, and cut low on the outside. Splitter sheared into the Mizzrym\u0027s torso just below the ribs, and he collapsed in a gush of blood. Magic trilled and flickered through the air. When Ryld spun around, the other twin and Relonor popped into being on the rooftop below. Obviously, House Mizzrym\u0027s mage could teleport on his own, without the aid of the brooch Pharaun had pilfered. His voluminous sleeves sliding down to his elbows, Relonor lifted his arms and started to cast a spell. The newly arrived twin nocked an arrow and drew back the string of his pale bone bow. Ryld threw himself down on his stomach. He was ten feet above his adversaries, and he hoped that they couldn\u0027t see him. Sure enough, no magic or arrow flew in his direction. He scuttled across the platform - enchantments in his armor deadening the sound of his footfalls - and grabbed his previous opponent\u0027s bow and quiver, then scrambled to his knees The twin and the wizard rose above the platform, the former levitating, the latter soaring in an arc that revealed some magical capacity for actual flight. The archer loosed an arrow, and mystical energy flashed from Relonor\u0027s fingertips. The Mizzrym\u0027s magic reached its target first. A ghastly shriek stabbed through Ryld\u0027s ears and into his brain. He cried out and flailed in agony. The warrior\u0027s arrow plunged into his thigh, and the razor-edged point burst from the other side. After a moment, the screaming stopped. Ryld could feel that it had hurt him, perhaps worse than the arrow had, but had no time or inclination to fret about it. Quickly as few folk save a master of Melee-Magthere could manage, he loosed two shafts of his own. The first took Relonor in the chest, and the second stabbed into the warrior\u0027s belly. They both dropped down out of sight. Ryld looked at the twin with the sword cut in his flank. The male appeared to be unconscious, which would facilitate searching him. Ryld hobbled over to him to rifle his pockets and the leather satchel he wore on his belt. Blessedly, he found four silver vials, each marked with the rune for healing. Greyanna had indeed outfitted her agents properly for a martial expedition. It was the twin\u0027s misfortune that he hadn\u0027t had time to drink of her bounty before going into shock. His brother and Relonor no doubt carried healing draughts as well, and Ryld had no guarantee that they\u0027d be unable to use them. They might come after him again any second, and he\u0027d just as soon avoid a second round. He needed to beat a hasty - Enormous wings beat the air. A long-necked, legless beast passed overhead with Greyanna and the other priestess, the skinny one, astride its back. Glaring down at Ryld, Pharaun\u0027s sister pulled at the laces securing the mouth of her bag of monsters. Ryld dumped the remaining arrows out of the quiver, the better to examine them. One was fletched with red feathers while the rest had black. He\u0027d already seen his first foe shoot one fire arrow. Praying that the red-fletched arrow was another, he drew back his bowstring and sent it hurtlinginto the air. The arrow plunged Into the sack, and burst into flame. The scarred high priestess reflexively dropped the bag, and it fell, burning as it went. The magic spores combusting inside turned the fire green, then blue, then violet. Greyanna screamed in fury and sent the foulwing swooping lower. Ryld looked for another magic arrow and found that none were left. He nocked an ordinary one, and his hands began to shake, no doubt an aftereffect of the punishment he\u0027d taken. For a moment, it seemed to him that he was finished. If he couldn\u0027t shoot accurately, he couldn\u0027t hit one of the foulwing\u0027s vital spots, or the riders on its back, for that matter. Nor was he in any shape to fight them hand to hand. Then he realized he still had a chance. He surrounded his arrow with a cloud of murky darkness, then shot it upward. The descending beast was a huge target. Even shooting blind with trembling hands, he had a fair chance of hitting in somewhere, and the foul-wing gave a double shriek that told him he\u0027d succeeded. He watched the mass of darkness he\u0027d created tumble and zigzag drunkenly through the air. Stung, suddenly and inexplicably sightless, the winged mount inside had panicked, and Greyanna was evidently unable to control it. She quite possibly could have dissolved the darkness with some scroll or talisman, but she couldn\u0027t see either or lay hands on her equipment easily with the foulwing lurching and swooping about beneath her. Ryld snapped the head off the arrow in his leg and pulled the offending object out. He gathered up the healing potions, and quickly as he was able, activated the magic in his talisman, floated down off the roof, and limped away.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dissolution-war-of-the-spider-queen-1/page-12.html","bookId":2159,"book":{"id":2159,"title":"Dissolution (War of the Spider Queen #1)","description":"Storyline: Dissolution (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
