{"id":70011,"no":54,"title":"Page 54","content":"“Oh, no…” After all the times they’d made love, learned and explored each other’s bodies in the past three days, he still couldn’t completely accept her tears, fearing he was the cause. Once again, Carol tried to make him understand. “I…I didn’t realize making love could be so wonderful…so good.” Alex momentarily closed his eyes, his look full of chagrin and something else she couldn’t name. “We didn’t take any precautions last night.” His words triggered a slow easy smile. “I know, and I’m glad.” “Why? I thought we decided to wait a few months before we even considered starting a family. “What do you think your chances of getting pregnant are?” he asked after several minutes of kissing and touching. She smiled again. “About a hundred percent.” The room went quiet. When Alex spoke, his voice was strangled. “How would you feel about that?” “Unbelievably happy. I want your child, Alex.” His mouth found hers again for a kiss that grew wilder and wilder. Nestling her head against his strong shoulder, Carol sighed. She felt happier than she’d ever imagined possible. Happy with her husband, her family, herself. Epilogue After all the years Carol had worked as an obstetrical nurse, after all the birthing classes she’d taught, she should be able to recognize a contraction. Still, she wasn’t a hundred percent sure and had delayed contacting Alex until she was several hours into labor. Resting her hands on her distended abdomen, she rubbed it gently, taking in several relaxing breaths. Twins! She and Alex were having twins. He felt as excited, as ecstatic, as she did. Maybe even more so…Everything was ready for their babies. The nursery was furnished with two cradles, each with a different mobile hanging above it, and Alex had painted a mural, a forest scene, on the wall for his daughters. All their little sweaters and sleepers were stacked in twin dressers he’d lovingly refinished. Carol took another deep breath as the next pain struck. Then, knowing she shouldn’t delay much longer, she reached for the phone and called Alex at the office. “Yes,” he cried impatiently. This last week he’d been as nervous as…a father-to-be. “It’s Carol.” She heard his soft intake of breath. “Are you all right?” “I’m fine.” “You wouldn’t be calling me at the office if you were fine,” he countered sharply. “Is something going on that I should know about?” “Not really. At least not yet, but I think it might be a good idea if you took the rest of the afternoon off and came home.” “Now?” “If you’re in the middle of a project, I can wait,” she assured him, but she hoped he’d be home soon, otherwise she was going to end up driving herself to the hospital. “I’m not worried about me,” he said. “Are the babies coming now? Oh, Carol, I don’t know if I’m prepared for this.” “Don’t worry. I am.” Alex expelled his breath forcefully. “I’ll be there in ten minutes.” “Alex,” she cried. “Don’t speed.” She used the time before his arrival to make some phone calls, then collected her purse and her small suitcase—packed several weeks ago. Finally, she sank into her favorite chair, counting the minutes between contractions. From a block away, Carol could hear the roar of his truck as he sped toward the house. The squealing of brakes was followed by the truck door slamming. Seconds afterward, Alex vaulted into the house, breathless and pale. She didn’t get up from her chair; instead, Carol held out both hands to him. “Settle down, big daddy.” He flew to her side and knelt in front of her, clasping her hands in his. It took him a moment to compose himself. “This is it, isn’t it? We’re in labor?” he asked when he’d found his voice. “We’re in labor,” Carol told him and stroked his hair. “How can you be so calm about this?” She smiled and bent forward to brush her lips over his. “One of us has to be.” “I know…I know…you need me to be strong for you now, but look at me,” he said, holding out his hands for her inspection. “I’m shaking.” Gently he laid those same shaking hands on Carol’s abdomen, and when he glanced up at her, his eyes were bright with unshed tears. “I love these babies—our daughters—so much. I can’t believe how lucky I am. And now that they’re about to be born, I feel so humble, so unworthy.” “Oh, Alex…” “I guess we’d better go. Is there anything we need to do first?” “No. I’ve phoned my mother and the doctor, and my suitcase is by the door.” She made an effort to disguise the intensity of her next contraction by closing her eyes and breathing slowly and deeply until it passed. When she opened her eyes, she discovered Alex watching her intently. If possible, he looked paler than he had before. “Are you going to be all right?” she asked. “I…I don’t know. I love our babies, but I love you more than anything. I can’t stand to see you in pain. I—” His words were interrupted by the sound of another car pulling into the driveway and two doors slamming. James burst into the house first, followed by Peter, both looking as excited as if it were Christmas morning. “What are you two doing home from school?” Carol demanded. “We heard you were in labor. You don’t think we’d miss this, do you?” “You heard?” Carol echoed. “How? From whom?” The two boys eyed each other. “We’ve got our sources,” James said. This wasn’t the time or place to question them. “All right, we won’t discuss it now. James, take care of your father. Peter, load up the car. I think it might be best if you drove me yourself. James, bring your father—he’s in no condition to drive.” Their sons leaped into action. “Come on, Dad, we’re going to have a couple of babies,” James said, urging his father toward the late-model sedan the two boys shared. By the time they got to Ford Memorial, Carol’s pains had increased dramatically. She was wheeled to the labor room while James and Peter were left to fend for themselves in the waiting room. Alex was more composed by now, more in control. He smiled shyly and took her hand, clutching it between both of his. “How are you doing?” “Alex, I’m going to be fine and so are our daughters.” Janice Mandle came bustling in, looking pleased. “Okay, we all ready for this special delivery?” she asked. “Ready,” Carol said, nodding firmly. “Ready,” Alex echoed. With Janice’s help and Alex’s love, Carol made it through her next contractions. As she was being taken into the delivery room, Alex walked beside her. The pains were coming faster, but she managed to smile up at him. “Don’t worry,” she whispered. “I love you,” he whispered back. He reached for her hand again and they met, palm to palm, heart to heart. “Grandma, can I have seconds on the zabaglione?” James called from the large family kitchen. Angelina Pasquale’s smile widened and her eyes met those of her daughter. “I told you my cooking would put some meat on his bones.” “That you did, Mama,” Carol said, exchanging a private smile with her husband. She and the babies had been home for a week. Royalty couldn’t have been treated better. James and Peter were crazy about their sisters, and so far the only tasks allotted Carol had been diaper-changing and breastfeeding. She was well aware that the novelty would wear off, but she didn’t expect it to be too soon. Angie and Alison had stolen two teenage hearts without even trying. “I brought you some tea,” Alex said, sliding onto the sofa beside her. His eyes were filled with love. From the moment Carol was brought to the delivery room, the light in Alex’s eyes hadn’t changed. It was filled with an indescribable tenderness. As she gave birth, his hand had gripped hers and when their two perfect identical daughters were born, there’d been tears in both parents’ eyes. Tears of joy. Tears of gratitude. They’d each been granted so much more than they’d ever dreamed. New life. New love. A new appreciation for all the good things in store for them and their combined families. The soft lilting words of an Italian lullaby drifted toward Carol and Alex. Eyes closed, Carol’s mother rocked in her chair, a sleeping infant cradled in each arm. The words were familiar to Carol; she’d heard her mother sing them to her as a child. When she’d finished, Angelina Pasquale murmured a soft, emotional prayer. “What did she say?” Alex asked, leaning close to Carol. A smile tugged at the edges of Carol’s mouth. Her fingers were twined with Alex’s and she raised his knuckles to her lips and kissed them gently. “She was thanking St. Rita for a job well done.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/right-next-door/page-54.html","bookId":1962,"book":{"id":1962,"title":"Right Next Door","description":"Storyline: Right Next Door (The Courtship of Carol Sommars \u0026 Father\u0027s Day) The Courtship of Carol Sommars Peter Sommars is fifteen, and what he needs is a little more independence.
