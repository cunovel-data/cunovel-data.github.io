That self was?and still is?the wife of a rich, handsome executive with an ocean-view house and his own security staff. \\n It was in that house, two years ago, that Bryce Palmer learned Bronwyn was pregnant with their first child. But Bryce\u0027s rage over his impending fatherhood touched off a chain reaction of emotional and physical traumas that wounded them both. For Bronwyn, it meant fleeing the perfect marriage to start over with nothing but a precocious daughter named Kayla to care for. For Bryce, it meant a tortuous two years spent blaming his wife for deserting him, and living with the pain of not knowing his child. Now a chance encounter has brought Bronwyn back into Bryce\u0027s life, both bearing scars?and neither knowing the whole truth of that fateful night that drove them apart.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-husband-s-regret-unwanted-2.jpg","author":"Natasha Anders","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
