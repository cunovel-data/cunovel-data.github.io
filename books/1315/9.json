{"id":33082,"no":9,"title":"Chapter Nine. The Honourable Rosalind.","content":"By the beginning of October Peggy had quite settled down in her new home, and had established her right to be Arthur Saville’s sister by convulsing the quiet household with her tricks and capers. She was affectionate, obedient, and strictly truthful; her prim little face, grandiose expressions, and merry ways, made her a favourite with everyone in the house, from the vicar, who loved to converse with her in language even more high-flown than her own, to the old North-country cook, who confided in the housemaid that she “fair–ly did love that little thing,” and manoeuvred to have apple charlotte for dinner as often as possible, because the “little thing” had praised her prowess in that direction, and commended the charlotte as a “delicious confection.” Mrs Asplin was specially tender over the girl who had been left in her charge, and, in return, Peggy was all that was sweet and affectionate, vowed that she could never do enough to repay such kindness, and immediately fell into a fresh pickle, and half frightened the life out of her companions by her hairbreadth escapes. Her careless, happy-go-lucky ways seemed all the more curious because of the almost Quaker-like neatness of her appearance. Mellicent was often untidy, and even Esther had moments of dishevelment, but Peggy was a dainty little person, whose hair was always smooth, whose dress well brushed and natty. Her artistic sense was too keen to allow of any shortcoming in this respect; but she seemed blessed with a capacity of acting before she thought, which had many disastrous consequences. She was by no means a robust girl, and Mrs Asplin fussed over her little ailments like an old mother-hen with a delicate nursling. One prescription after another was unearthed for her benefit, until the washstand in her room looked like a small chemist’s shop. An array of doctor’s tinctures, gargles, and tonics, stood on one side, while on the other were a number of home-made concoctions in disused wine-bottles, such as a paregoric cough-mixture, and a cooling draught to be taken the first thing in the morning, which last pretended to be lemonade, but in reality contained a number of medicinal powders. “Take it up tenderly, treat it with care!” was Peggy’s motto with respect to this last-named medicine, for she had discovered that by judicious handling it was possible to enjoy a really tasty beverage, and to leave the sediment untouched at the bottom of the bottle! Esther and Mellicent were almost equally well supplied by their anxious mother, but their bottles behaved in a well-regulated fashion, and never took upon themselves to play tricks, while those in Peggy’s room seemed infected by the spirit of the owner, and amused themselves with seeing how much mischief they could accomplish. A bottle of ammonia had been provided as a cure for bites of gnats and flies; Peggy flicked a towel more hastily than usual, and down it fell, the contents streaming over the wood, and splashing on to the wardrobe near at hand, with the consequence that every sign of polish was removed, and replaced by white unsightly stains. The glass stopper of a smelling-salts bottle became fixed in its socket, and, being anointed with oil and placed before the fire to melt, popped out suddenly with a noise as of a cannon shot, aimed accurately for the centre of the mirror, and smashed it into a dozen pieces. The “safety ink-pot,” out of which she indited her letters to her mother, came unfastened of its own accord and rolled up and down the clean white toilet cover. This, at least, was the impression left by Peggy’s innocent protestations, while the gas and soap seemed equally obstinate—the one refusing to be lowered when she left the room, and the other insisting upon melting itself to pieces in her morning bath! “Mrs Saville was right—Peggy is a most expensive person!” cried Mrs Asplin in dismay, when the bills for repairs came in; but when the vicar suggested the advisability of a reproof, she said, “Oh, poor child; she is so lonely—I haven’t the heart to scold her;” and Peggy continued to detail accounts of her latest misfortune with an air of exaggerated melancholy, which barely concealed the underlying satisfaction. It required a philosophic mind to be able to take damages to personal property in so amiable a fashion; but occasionally Peggy’s pickles took an irresistibly comical character. The story was preserved in the archives of the family of one evening when the three girls had been sent upstairs to wash their abundant locks and dry them thoroughly before retiring to bed. A fire was kindled in the old nursery, which was now used as a sewing-room, and Mrs Asplin, who understood nothing if it was not the art of making young folks happy, had promised a supper of roast apples and cream when the drying process was finished. Esther and Mellicent were squatted on the hearth, in their blue dressing-gowns, when in tripped Peggy, fresh as a rose, in a long robe of furry white, tied round the waist with a pink cord. One bath-towel was round her shoulders, and a smaller one extended in her hands, with the aid of which she proceeded to perform a fancy dance, calling out instructions to herself the while, in imitation of the dancing-school mistress. “To the right—two—three! To the left—two—three! Spring! Pirouette! Atti–tude!” She stood poised on one foot, towel waving above her head, damp hair dripping down her back, while Esther and Mellicent shrieked with laughter, and drummed applause with heel and toe. Then she flopped down on the centre of the hearth, and there was an instantaneous exclamation of dismay. “Phew! What a funny smell! Phew! Phew! Whatever can it be?” “I smelt it too. Peggy, what have you been doing? It’s simply awful!” “Hair-wash, I suppose, or the soap—I noticed it myself. It will pass off,” said Peggy easily; but at that moment Mrs Asplin entered the room, sniffed the air, and cried loudly— “Bless me, what’s this? A regular Apothecaries’ Hall! Paregoric! It smells as if someone had been drinking quarts of paregoric! Peggy, child, your throat is not sore again?” “Not at all, thank you. Quite well. I have taken no medicine to-day.” “But it is you, Peggy—it really is!” Mellicent declared. “There was no smell at all before you came into the room. I noticed it as soon as the door was opened, and when you came and sat down beside us—whew! simply fearful!” “I have taken no medicine to-day,” repeated Peggy firmly. Then she started, as if with a sudden thought, lifted a lock of hair, sniffed at it daintily, and dropped it again with an air of conviction. “Ah, I comprehend! There seems to have been a slight misunderstanding. I have mistaken the bottles. I imagined that I was using the mixture you gave me, but—” “She has washed her hair in cough-mixture! Oh, oh, oh! She has mixed paregoric and treacle with the water! Oh, what will I do! what will I do! This child will be the death of me!” Mrs Asplin put her hand to her side, and laughed until the tears ran down her cheeks, while Mellicent rolled about on the floor, and Esther’s quiet “He, he, he!” filled up the intervals between the bursts of merriment. Peggy was marched off to have her hair re-washed and rinsed, and came back ten minutes later, proudly complacent, to seat herself in the most comfortable stool and eat roast apple with elegant enjoyment. She was evidently quite ready to enlarge upon her latest feat, but the sisters had exhausted the subject during her absence, and had, moreover, a piece of news to communicate which was of even greater interest. “Oh, Peggy, what y’think?” cried Mellicent, running her words into each other in breathless fashion, as her habit was when excited; “I’ve got something beautiful to tell you. S’afternoon Bob got a letter from his mother to say that they were all coming down next week to stay at the Larches for the winter. They come almost every year, and have shooting-parties, and come to church and sit in the big square pew, where you can just see their heads over the side. They look so funny, sitting in a row without their bodies. Last year there was a young lady with them who wore a big grey hat—the loveliest hat you ever saw—with roses under the brim, and stick-up things all glittering with jewels, and she got married at Christmas. I saw her photograph in a magazine, and knew her again in a moment. I used to stare at her, and once she smiled back at me. She looked sweet when she smiled. Lady Darcy always comes to call on mother, and she and father go there to dinner ever so many times, and we are asked to play with Rosalind—the Honourable Rosalind. I expect they will ask you to go too. Isn’t it exciting?” “I can bear it,” said Peggy coldly. “If I try very hard, I think I can support the strain.” The Larches, the country house of Lord Darcy, had already been pointed out to her notice; but the information that the family was coming down for the yearly visit was unwelcome to her, for a double reason. She feared, in the first place, lest it should mean a separation from Bob, who was her faithful companion, and fulfilled his promise of friendship in a silent, undemonstrative fashion, much to her fancy. In the second place, she was conscious of a rankling feeling of jealousy towards the young lady who was distinguished by the name of the Honourable Rosalind, and who seemed to occupy an exalted position in the estimation of the vicar’s daughters. Her name was frequently introduced into conversation, and always in the most laudatory fashion. When a heroine was of a superlatively fascinating description, she was “Just like Rosalind”; when an article of dress was unusually fine and dainty, it would “do for Rosalind.” Rosalind was spoken of with bated breath, as if she were a princess in a fairy tale, rather than an ordinary flesh-and-blood damsel. And Peggy did not like it; she did not like it at all, for, in her own quiet way, she was accustomed to queen it among her associates, and could ill brook the idea of a rival. She had not been happy at school, but she had been complacently conscious that of all the thirty girls she was the most discussed, the most observed, and also, among the pupils themselves, the most beloved. At the vicarage she was an easy first. When the three girls went out walking, she was always in the middle, with Esther and Mellicent hanging on an arm at either side. Robert was her sworn vassal, and Max and Oswald her respectful and, on the whole, obedient servants. Altogether, the prospect of playing second fiddle to this strange girl was by no means pleasant. Peggy tilted her chin, and spoke in a cool, cynical tone. “What is she like, this wonderful Rosalind? Bob does not seem to think her extraordinary. I cannot imagine a ‘Miss Robert’ being very beautiful, and as she is his sister, I suppose they are alike.” Instantly there arose a duet of protests. “Not in the least. Not a single bit. Rosalind is lovely! Blue eyes, golden hair—” “Down past her waist—” “The sweetest little hands—” “A real diamond ring—” “Pink cheeks—” “Drives a pony-carriage, with long-tailed ponies—” “Speaks French all day long with her governess—jabber, jabber, jabber, as quick as that—just like a native—” “Plays the violin—” “Has a lovely little sitting-room of her own, simply crammed with the most exquisite presents and books, and goes travelling abroad to France and Italy and hot places in winter. Lord and Lady Darcy simply worship her, and so does everyone, for she is as beautiful as a picture. Don’t you think it would be lovely to have a lord and lady for your father and mother?” Peggy sniffed the air in scornful superiority. “I am very glad I’ve not! Titles are so ostentatious! Vulgar, I call them! The very best families will have nothing to do with them. My father’s people were all at the Crusades, and the Wars of the Roses, and the Field of the Cloth of Gold. There is no older family in England, and they are called ‘Fighting Savilles,’ because they are always in the front of every battle, winning honours and distinctions. I expect they have been offered titles over and over again, but they would not have them. They refused them with scorn, and so would I if one were offered to me. Nothing would induce me to accept it!” Esther rolled her eyes in a comical, sideway fashion, and gave a little chuckle of unbelief; but Mellicent looked quite depressed by this reception of her grand news, and said anxiously— “But, Peggy, think of it! The Honourable Mariquita! It would be too lovely! Wouldn’t you feel proud writing it in visitors’ books, and seeing it printed in newspapers when you grow up? ‘The Honourable Mariquita wore a robe of white satin, trimmed with gold!’” “Peggy Saville is good enough for me, thank you,” said that young lady, with a sudden access of humility. “I have no wish to have my clothes discussed in the public prints. But if you are invited to the Larches to play with your Rosalind, pray don’t consider me! I can stay at home alone. I don’t mind being dull. I can turn my time to good account. Not for the world would I interfere with your pleasure?” “But P–P–Peggy, dar–ling Peggy, we would not leave you alone!” Mellicent’s eyes were wide with horror, she stretched out entreating hands towards the unresponsive figure. To see Peggy cross and snappish like—any other ordinary mortal was an extraordinary event, and quite alarming to her placid mind. “They will ask you, too, dear! I am sure they will—we will all be asked together!” she cried; but Peggy tossed her head, refusing to be conciliated. “I shall have a previous engagement. I am not at all sure that they are the sort of people I ought to know,” she said. “My parents are so exclusive! They might not approve of the acquaintance!”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1503/44839.html","bookId":1315,"book":{"id":1315,"title":"About Peggy Saville","description":"简介： The afternoon post had come in, and the Vicar of Renton stood in the bay window of his library reading his budget of letters.
