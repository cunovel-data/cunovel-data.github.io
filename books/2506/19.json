{"id":107307,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Although the morning was cool, Konige Kunigunde had ordered the windows in her reception hall thrown open, not only to give the room more light, but to provide the new arrivals with an opportunity to view Praha, spread out below Vaclav Castle, a reminder of the power of the Court. There were sprays of blossom-covered branches over the windows, and fresh rushes on the floor. An air of strained expectancy hung over the Court, the delay in the presentation of the new ladies creating restiveness everywhere, for there was to be a parade of the Konig\u0027s army later that afternoon, a grand occasion no one wanted to miss, least of all for the presentation of three Hungarian ladies.\\n\\n At the far end of the reception hall, Konige Kunigunde sat on her throne that glowed with gold-leaf; she glistened with jewels in her profusion of necklaces. Her crown, too, was studded with pearls and polished gems. Her posture was stiff as the golden cloth of her huchine encouraged her to be, and her face was expressionless; her gaze was fixed on the far wall where a new tapestry depicted the life of Sant Vaclav, Dux of Bohemia, featuring a central scene of the Dux and his page trudging through the snow; Hovarth Pisti and two of his apprentices stood next to the wall where the tapestry hung, all three of them glorious in new Court finery.\\n\\n The Konige\u0027s current ladies-in-waiting stood around the throne, each in her newest formal Court garments, displaying the wealth and beauty of Bohemia and the grandeur of its Court. All the women wore cloth-of-gold huchines over their bleihauts, the long, open-sleeved garments the most opulent sign of luxury in all the sumptuous display. Only Milica of Olmutz was absent so that she could take care of the Konige\u0027s daughters.\\n\\n In the broad corridor beyond the reception hall, the new arrivals waited with their escorts. Two of the women, new to the Court, fretted, fidgeted, and tried to hide it; they both were still weary from their long journey and as yet unsettled in their own quarters. The third woman, Rozsa of Borsod, affected a kind of boredom to remind all those around her that she was accustomed to the rituals and trials of Court life. Her displeasure was the ache in her back from standing too long; her pregnancy was beginning to show, her breasts had become larger, and she was hungrier than she wanted to admit.\\n\\n As the younger of the two new ladies-in-waiting, Iliska of Szousa was the most restive; she made mincing steps around her brother, who was escorting her, shaking her hands as if to rid herself of her edginess.\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" her brother hissed in Magyar.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m nervous,\" Iliska answered in an undervoice. She stroked the elaborate belt of braided silver that hung low on her waist; her bleihaut was of Hungarian cut, with deep sleeves edged in more silver thread, setting off her blue-silk chainse.\\n\\n The escorts of the other two women ignored Iliska\u0027s complaints, their attention on the reception room and the magnificent Konige\u0027s Court.\\n\\n \"Why do we have to go through all this elaborate ceremony?\" Iliska bounced on her toes. \"Why can\u0027t we just join the Konige at table? We could be more easily introduced there, couldn\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n \"You know the answer, sister mine: that would do no honor to Bohemia and its territories and it would insult Hungary, into the bargain.\" He reached out his hand. \"Be still and comport yourself with dignity. You are a Konige\u0027s woman now. You are observed.\"\\n\\n \"Why must I do that? Doesn\u0027t the Court ever get excited?\" She rounded on Rozsa. \"You have been here before. Do we always have to behave as if we were watching the Pope celebrate Mass?\"\\n\\n \"When there are strangers present, yes we do,\" said Rozsa, her mouth turned down in disapproval. \"If the occasion is made a Court function, then we are more than ourselves, and we must never forget that.\" Her ruby-colored silken bleihaut was lavishly embroidered with patterns of birds flying worked in thread that ranged from wine to purple to black, and her chainse was golden Persian silk. She tried to smile at the newcomers, but only achieved a rictus.\\n\\n \"Are you glad to be back at Court?\" Iliska persisted.\\n\\n \"Under the circumstances, yes, I am.\"\\n\\n \"Iliska, be quiet,\" her brother ordered her.\\n\\n She paid no attention. \"Under what circumstances?\" When she received no answer she bounced closer to Rozsa. \"Tell me; what circumstances?\"\\n\\n \"Why ask me? I would have thought that you\u0027d worm it out of my escorts while we came here,\" said Rozsa, her patience strained.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t realize you might have more than the honor of serving the Konige to bring you back to the Court,\" said Iliska, offering a brazen grin. \"Traveling in your condition shows dedication.\"\\n\\n \"It shows prudence, you child; Bela is ailing and my husband is away,\" Rozsa said sharply, hoping to quell Iliska\u0027s questions. \"I am here at the behest of my husband, and the pleasure of the Konige.\"\\n\\n \"You have a task to perform,\" Iliska decided aloud.\\n\\n \"As have you, as have we all,\" said Rozsa, growing more weary of their game.\\n\\n \"Then you will know if we will be presented to Golden Otakar before he and his army departs, or whether this will be our presentation for both Konige and Konig.\" There was a hard light in her honey-colored eyes.\\n\\n \"Do be quiet,\" said Antal, glaring at his sister. \"This isn\u0027t the time.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re waiting. Why can\u0027t we talk while we wait?\" She glared at him. \"If we must remain still, can\u0027t we talk?\"\\n\\n \"We wait at the pleasure of the Konige,\" said Antal. \"Be grateful you are here and ask God to give you contentment for it.\"\\n\\n \"But must we all keep silent?\" Iliska flung up her hands in frustration.\\n\\n Kustansze of Lugoj gave Iliska a hard look. \"We are waiting upon Episcopus Fauvinel, who has been delayed with the Konig\u0027s men. He has blessed the criminals being hanged from the walls and now he is saying the farewell Mass for the Konig\u0027s army, since it departs tomorrow at dawn, and the men wish to be shriven before they go.\"\\n\\n Iliska pursed her lips in annoyance. \"Doesn\u0027t he know it\u0027s ill-mannered to keep the Konige\u0027s Court dependent on him to begin, but unable to on his account because he can\u0027t be bothered to arrive when everyone else does? Can\u0027t another religious open the Court if the Episcopus is attending to the Konig? It\u0027s allowed in Hungary.\"\\n\\n \"Bohemia isn\u0027t Hungary,\" Kustansze reminded Iliska as if she were talking to a child of eight.\\n\\n \"We are in a foreign land, for the sake of the Konige Kunigunde and Konig Bela.\" Rozsa stared directly at Iliska. \"And don\u0027t forget that the Episcopus has as many spies in the Konige\u0027s household as anyone. Nothing you say, and nothing you do, will go unnoticed. Nothing.\" Something self-satisfied flickered in her face, but vanished before Iliska was sure it was there.\\n\\n \"All right-I\u0027ll be quiet,\" Iliska said, sulking.\\n\\n Kustansze managed a near-smile. \"Cultivate patience, Iliska. You\u0027ll need it at Court.\"\\n\\n Iliska gave a heavy sigh. \"We shouldn\u0027t have to stand here like this.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, we should,\" said Kustansze, reaching up to push a holding pin into the elaborate braid that encircled her head. \"It is required of us for the Konige\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n \"Will you both be quiet,\" Rozsa exclaimed. \"We are being overheard. Keep that in your thoughts at all times.\"\\n\\n \"Spies.\" Iliska sighed. \"Everyone knows spies can be bought.\"\\n\\n \"Iliska, hold your tongue,\" Antal told her more forcefully as he raised his hand. \"You wouldn\u0027t want to make your courtisy with a mark on your face.\"\\n\\n Iliska glowered at him, then turned away, her lower lip quivering in fear and chagrin. She muttered something about unfairness and the ill-conduct of brothers. The others pointedly looked away from her, for which she was grateful, but she suspected it was because they wanted to divorce themselves from her jejune behavior. A short while later, she sighed again and said, \"At least the windows are open.\"\\n\\n \"On the Konige\u0027s order,\" Kustansze reminded her.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Iliska; she had taken the end of her long white veil in her hands and was pressing minute pleats into the cloth.\\n\\n A sudden squeal of buisines announced the arrival of the Episcopus, and a second ostentation informed all of Vaclav Castle that the Konig was accompanying the Episcopus. Servants rushed to man the doors of the reception hall, almost shoving the women and their escorts aside in their haste.\\n\\n \"Move to the wall,\" Rozsa recommended. \"The Konig is going to pass.\"\\n\\n Iliska glanced at her brother, giving him a wicked grin. \"And you said he wouldn\u0027t have time for the Konige\u0027s Court.\"\\n\\n \"He may not linger. Don\u0027t assume he\u0027ll notice you,\" Antal said blightingly.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Iliska said, slipping next to the window so that the light would fall on her face.\\n\\n \"Courtisy him, but do not speak unless he addresses you,\" Rozsa reminded the other two women. \"And the Episcopus as well.\"\\n\\n The doors at the end of the broad corridor banged open, and the Konig\u0027s German Guards strode toward the reception room, their armor shining, their weapons jangling as they walked. At their rear came Otakar himself, crowned and in full armor but for his helmet. His breastplate and the chain mail of his coif were gilded, and his new ceremonial sword with its gem-encrusted hilt hung in a jeweled scabbard. He barely glanced at the women and their escorts, the women courtisying, the men kneeling, but went directly into the reception hall of the Konige\u0027s Court, her herald crying out his name as he came into the hall.\\n\\n \"Remain as you are,\" Rozsa warned Iliska, who was starting to rise. \"The Episcopus is coming.\"\\n\\n Iliska clicked her tongue but remained in the half-crouch position of the courtisy. \"Where is he, then?\" she whispered.\\n\\n As if responding to her remark, a company of Trinitarian and Assumptionist monks entered the corridor in double-file, two of them bearing a large golden monstrance between them. At their rear came Episcopus Fauvinel, his vestments and miter glistening with gold and silver thread and studded with pearls and diamonds. He carried a tall crozier that thumped with every second step he took. He paused long enough to make the sign of the cross over the three women and their escorts, then passed on into the reception hall to the greeting of the herald\u0027s stentorian voice.\\n\\n \"Can I straighten up now?\" Iliska asked impatiently.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Rozsa rubbed at the small of her back. \"It is many, many days until September,\" she remarked to Kustansze.\\n\\n \"And you will feel the days more keenly than we will,\" said the Konige\u0027s second cousin. \"Especially after June. I know how it was with my children.\"\\n\\n \"You are to return home in June, do I have that right?\" Iliska inquired with apparent solicitousness.\\n\\n \"You know you do,\" Rozsa told her. \"You\u0027ve asked me about it often enough coming here.\"\\n\\n Iliska said something under her breath and looked away from Rozsa. \"The Konig is bowing to the Konige.\"\\n\\n \"He is in her Court. Of course he bows,\" said Rozsa. \"Didn\u0027t your father tell you anything about Court?\"\\n\\n \"He told me what I had to do for Szousa, and what I ought not to do,\" said Iliska, trying to show more confidence than she felt.\\n\\n From the reception hall came a rustle of clothes as the Court knelt, followed by the Episcopus\u0027 voice droning out his blessing on the Konige\u0027s Court and the dear Royals themselves, and admonishing all attending to strive to be worthy of the gracious friendship the dear Royals extended to all, and explaining that failure to be upstanding in the name of the Konige would also mean that the courtier had failed God, Whose Will it was that Konig Otakar and Konige Kunigunde should rule here. Last he called upon all the Konige\u0027s Court to welcome the new-comers and to show them courtesy for the sake of Konige Kunigunde. At the sign from the Episcopus the Court rose, and the Konig went to kneel to his wife and charge her with the safety of Praha in his absence.\\n\\n \"May God guide me in all ways to serve you, dear Royal, and the Kingdom of Bohemia,\" the Konige said to her husband.\\n\\n The herald bawled out the names of the women to be presented and their escorts, giving their titles and their estates; in the reception hall, the Konig, his personal guard, and the Episcopus stood aside, leaving an aisle for the women to approach the Konige\u0027s dais.\\n\\n \"Kustansze of Lugoj, daughter of Kazmir of Lugoj, kinswoman of Konige Kunigunde, escorted by Padnagy Kalman, Dux of Oradea.\"\\n\\n Kustansze stepped forward and courtisied the Konige. \"May God show you all favor, dear Royal,\" she said in awkward Bohemian.\\n\\n \"Be welcome in Bohemia, good cousin,\" said the Konige, and nodded to her so that she would step aside.\\n\\n \"Iliska of Szousa, daughter of the Comes of Szousa,\" announced the herald, \"escorted by her brother, Antal of Szousa.\"\\n\\n Iliska felt a warning jab in her side from Antal\u0027s thumb as she stepped away from him to courrtisy the Konige. \"The blessings of God and man be with you, dear Royal.\"\\n\\n \"Prettily said,\" Konige Kunigunde approved, and waved her away.\\n\\n \"Rozsa of Borsod, wife of Notay Tibor of Kaposvar,\" the herald declared.\\n\\n Rozsa\u0027s courtisy was not as deep as Court usually required, but the Konige made allowances for Rozsa\u0027s pregnancy. \"I am greatly honored to return to your resplendent Court, dear Royal,\" she said, using Milan of Gyula\u0027s arm to steady herself.\\n\\n \"I am happy to have you here again, Rozsa of Borsod. Kinga has missed you.\" For the first time there was animation in Kunigunde\u0027s face. \"You will find your friends are glad of your return.\" She held up her hand to indicate her ladies-in-waiting. \"And I will be happy to have news of my grandfather and my brother.\"\\n\\n \"Dear Royal is all kindness; it will be my most pressing duty to speak with you of all that has been happening at Konig Bela\u0027s Court,\" said Rozsa, stepping back and taking a surreptitious glance around the room caught sight of Rakoczy Ferancsi standing with Tirz Agoston of Mures; Rakoczy held a new lyre in his hands, softly testing the strings and listening to Agoston\u0027s instructions as he did. Rozsa kept herself from smiling, but she felt encouraged to find him still at Court; she had plans to see him again.\\n\\n Konig Otakar stepped up onto the dais, the Konige\u0027s women moving back from her so that they would not offend the ruler. \"I have members of your Court to thank, dear Royal, before I leave for battle, and it is fitting that I do it here.\"\\n\\n \"You are welcome, my Konig,\" said Kunigunde, rising to honor him.\\n\\n \"If you will call forth those who have done service for you to my benefit?\" He raised his new ceremonial sword. \"I will bestow my thanks upon them.\"\\n\\n The herald called out, \"Hovarth Pisti of Buda.\"\\n\\n The tapestry-weaver came through the assembled Court, not quite strutting, his face flushed with pride. \"Dear Royal,\" he said as he went on his knee in front of the dais.\\n\\n \"For the magnificent tapestry that now adorns this hall, and the two others that hang in the Konige\u0027s private apartments, I show you my thanks and bestow upon you this ring\"-he took a gold band from his sleeve-\"and ask you to wear it in testament to your service to the Konige and the glory of Bohemia. A stipend of ten golden Vaclavs will be paid to you annually for a period of ten years as a sign of our gratitude, and one golden Vaclav annually for a decade to each of your apprentices.\"\\n\\n Hovarth Pisti put the ring on his middle finger-the only one on which it would not be loose-and lowered his head. \"I and mine will thank your generosity for all generations to come.\"\\n\\n \"Most worthy,\" murmured the Konige as she signaled the Master Tapestry-Weaver to rise.\\n\\n \"Tirz Agoston of Mures,\" bellowed the herald, and the instrument-maker ducked his head to Rakoczy and went to the dais to kneel.\\n\\n Konig Otakar whispered a few words to Rytir Steffal von Passau, the German Guard nearest to him, then turned his attention to Tirz Agoston while Rytir Steffal departed on an errand. \"Good musician and maker of instruments,\" the Konig said, \"you and your instruments have brought many hours of pleasure to the Konige, and have soothed her in times of sadness, for which we are deeply grateful. In recognition of your excellent service, I present you with a badge of your service, set in gold, and dependent from a gold chain, so that all may witness our esteem and thanks. We also bestow upon you a grant of fifty golden Vaclavs to encourage you to help to bring your craft to greater perfection. In addition, we pledge to match that amount for a period of five years to enable your work to continue without hesitation or let.\" He took the chain with its pendant badge from his capacious sleeve and dropped it around Tirz Agoston\u0027s neck.\\n\\n \"I ... am overwhelmed by your k-kindness, dear Royal,\" Tirz Agoston stammered, touching the links as if he couldn\u0027t believe he wore them, his eyes dazed. \"May God reward your goodness.\"\\n\\n \"Most courteous,\" said the Konige, motioning him away from the dais.\\n\\n \"Pader Klothor,\" the herald summoned; a buzz of conversation rushed through the hall, for it was unusual to summon the Konige\u0027s treasurer to such events as these.\\n\\n A thin, elderly man in Redemptionist priest\u0027s habit came from the corridor leading into the private parts of the Konige\u0027s Court; he carried a ledger as if it were made of solid Bohemian gold. He stopped before Episcopus Fauvinel before he went to the Konig. \"Dear Royal,\" he said in a dusty voice as he went onto his knee.\\n\\n \"Pader Klothor,\" said the Konig, raising his ceremonial sword, \"tell the Court the accounting on this splendid symbol of Bohemia\u0027s power that my Konige has presented to me.\"\\n\\n Obediently the little priest opened the ledger and began to read, \"For gold, a measure equal to twenty-eight roundels of lead was used in the hilt, which is ornamented with two diamonds in the pommel, ten white sapphires in the grip, four emeralds, four tourmalines, four peridots, four topazes, four rubies, and ten tiger\u0027s-eyes in the quillons. The blade is of Luccan steel, weighing equal to fifteen roundels of lead. The scabbard is of silver the equivalent of twenty-one roundels of lead ornamented with ten amethysts and eight rose zircons. The gold is the work and the gift of Hrodperht von Ratisbon; the jewels are the gift of Rakoczy Ferancsi, Comes Santu-Germaniu.\"\\n\\n \"A princely treasure, provided by men who are not Bohemians, which is an excellent omen, for it says that the reach of this sword extends beyond this kingdom. It is a pledge of greater things to come beyond our present borders, one I will display to all the world when I am Holy Roman Emperor,\" the Konig proclaimed, hefting the sword above his head, smiling at the general acclaim. When he lowered the sword, the clamor quieted. \"In recognition of this imperial treasure-\" He signaled the herald.\\n\\n \"Hrodperht von Ratisbon,\" the herald called.\\n\\n The goldsmith made his way to the Konig, kneeling down with a great show of deference. He lowered his head and waited for Otakar to speak.\\n\\n \"Your workmanship and your gift have distinguished you among the Master Goldsmiths of Praha, and to demonstrate my appreciation, you will henceforth be known as Goldsmith to the Konig. As part of that advancement, you will be awarded a pension of twenty golden Vaclavs a year for life, and for ten years beyond for your heirs.\"\\n\\n Hrodperht was overcome with emotion; tears welled in his eyes and rolled down his face. He flung himself forward to seize Otakar\u0027s steel-booted foot and kiss it, exclaiming through his sobs, \"Most, most dear Royal, nothing can say how greatly your munificence has honored me.\"\\n\\n The Konig grinned. \"May I be so beloved by all my vassals,\" he said, and watched as the men in the reception hall went down on their knees to him, and the women courtisied. \"Rise, rise, all of you,\" he ordered a long moment later, using his sword to motion them upward. \"And you, my goldsmith, you have set a most admirable example. My choice of you is an excellent one.\"\\n\\n Nearly stumbling, Hrodperht got to his feet; he was still weeping, and his hands were clasped in devotion. \"Dear Royal is-\"\\n\\n \"Yes, yes,\" said Otakar. \"I have no doubt that you will show yourself fit for my favor.\"\\n\\n \"Your gift and work are beyond price,\" said the Konige as Hrodperht staggered away.\\n\\n At the Konig\u0027s sign, the herald yelled, \"Rakoczy Ferancsi, Comes Santu-Germaniu.\"\\n\\n This was the moment Rakoczy had been dreading, but there was no avoiding it without giving unpardonable offense to Bohemia. He moved through the Court with no sign of his dismay at this recognition; he paused to bow to the Episcopus, and then knelt to the Konig, his demeanor calm and self-contained, elegant in his black-and-silver velvet huch over a chainse of darkest-red silk against which his eclipse pectoral shone with the luster of the night sky.\\n\\n \"Comes, your jewels have made my sword and scabbard an object of beauty and a symbol of wealth and power. Were you a vassal of mine, I would be hard-pressed to reward you, for you have more riches than most of Bohemia together. I will not insult you with paltry riches when you are so clearly monied past all want.\" His chuckle was dutifully echoed by the Court. \"But as you are an exile, and your movements are restricted to Mansion Belcrady, the Konige\u0027s Court, the Council Hall, and the public streets of Praha, on the order of Konig Bela, I can at least reduce your restrictions and grant you free movements within five leagues of Praha, and all the buildings within the city\u0027s walls, your safety and protection assured through this, my grant to you.\"\\n\\n \"Dear Royal is most gracious,\" said Rakoczy, thinking of how irate Konig Bela would be when he learned of Otakar\u0027s modification of his exile. Nothing about him betrayed his anxiety as he lowered his head in another sign of respect.\\n\\n \"You have more than earned it,\" Otakar declared. \"You have enriched the Konige\u0027s Court, you have eased the Konige\u0027s sorrows, you have aided the Counselors, you have conducted yourself with probity, and you have cost the treasury nothing. I would be a fool not to give you what little I can in return.\" Before the Konig could launch into more fulsome praise, the Konige spoke up.\\n\\n \"You have my gratitude, and that of my daughters,\" she said, and dismissed Rakoczy with a turn of her hand. \"And I thank Pader Klothor for his careful accounts.\" A nod of her head sent the priest away.\\n\\n More relieved than he dared reveal, Rakoczy got to his feet and returned to the far end of the reception hall, his thoughts roiling: how was he to behave now? If he did not travel outside the city, Konig Otakar would be insulted, but if he did travel outside the city, Konig Bela would send his soldiers to pillage and ransack Santu-Germaniu. He was still deep in thought when he felt a hand on his sleeve; he turned and saw Rozsa of Borsod smiling conspiratorially at him. \"Dear lady,\" he said with an automatic bow.\\n\\n \"Oh, very prettily done,\" she said, staring directly at him. \"I didn\u0027t know you would still be here. I thought Konig Bela might have relented and summoned you home.\"\\n\\n \"That has not happened,\" said Rakoczy.\\n\\n \"More fool Konig Bela, then, for surely you could enrich his treasury as you have done for Konig Otakar.\" She studied him silently for a short while, then said, \"At least you haven\u0027t forgot me.\"\\n\\n \"No, I have not,\" he agreed, trying to discern her intentions.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you haven\u0027t.\"\\n\\n He bowed to her again, curious to learn what she wanted. \"Your husband must be pleased that you will give him a child.\"\\n\\n She laughed angrily. \"He may be, but his cousins are not. I\u0027m here so that they won\u0027t be able to cause me to miscarry. They have been Tibor\u0027s heirs and want to remain so. At home, with Tibor gone, they might do anything to remain his heirs.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" he said.\\n\\n \"The Counselors of Praha,\" the herald announced as the crowd parted once more to admit ten of the Counselors.\\n\\n \"My husband has gone to join Konig Otakar in his on-going war with Rudolph von Hapsburg; the Comes of Austria is determined to reclaim his fief from Bohemia. Tibor knew he would have to protect our child, and he couldn\u0027t do it sending me to Konig Bela\u0027s Court, for his cousins are there as well as at Kaposvar, and my position wouldn\u0027t protect me there.\" She touched him again. \"So he sent me back here-isn\u0027t that fortunate.\"\\n\\n \"If it spares your child, it certainly is,\" said Rakoczy, wishing he had reason to excuse himself from the Court.\\n\\n \"Yes, but there may be other reasons as well,\" she said, her eyes provoking him.\\n\\n \"For your child\u0027s sake, I think not,\" said Rakoczy drily.\\n\\n \"You can do me no disgrace now, no matter what you do to me,\" she persisted, relishing the risk she was taking in speaking so directly to him. \"I am pregnant, and no other seed shall quicken in my womb until this child I carry now is delivered. I have to protect my husband\u0027s heir.\"\\n\\n Rakoczy held up his hand. \"Say nothing more if you wish to keep your reputation.\"\\n\\n She laughed in her practiced way, her head tilted to beguile him. \"Are you afraid of what might happen to me? Then you aren\u0027t indifferent to my fate, are you?\"\\n\\n \"I have tasted your blood, Rozsa,\" he said in a hurried whisper. \"I cannot be indifferent to you.\"\\n\\n \"How that must vex you,\" she said, moving away from him to greet Gyongyi of Tolan, who had just stepped down from the dais on an errand for the Konige.\\n\\n Rakoczy stood by himself while the Konig spoke confidently of the victory that he knew would be his by the end of summer. Each assertion he made was greeted by the Court\u0027s acclaim, though the Konige\u0027s eyes were distant and troubled.\\n\\n \"They\u0027ve gone to get the two daughters,\" said a voice beside him; Rakoczy glanced around, then down, to discover Tahir standing next to him. \"Otakar is already planning brilliant marriages for them both.\"\\n\\n \"It is what all Konigs do with their daughters,\" said Rakoczy, feeling a pang for the two girls.\\n\\n \"Too long has Bohemia been denied its place in the world. God now shows us the way to the highest place in the Holy Roman Empire. What can I, and all of you, be but grateful for His gift to Golden Otakar?\"\\n\\n \"Would you repeat what you said?\" Rakoczy asked the dwarf.\\n\\n \"I told you to be careful of spies. With so much favor from the Konig, your enemies will multiply as maggots in a corpse.\" He ducked his head and went away through the crowd, while Rakoczy resisted the impulse to look about in the hope of discovering whom Tahir had had in mind when he gave his warning.\\n\\n Text of a report on the damage done by the Moltava\u0027s flooding, presented by Pader Baltzsar of Budejovice to Episcopus Fauvinel and the Counselors of Praha six days after the flood-waters receded.\\n\\n To the most reverend Episcopus Fauvinel and the most esteemed Counselors of Praha, the dutiful greetings of Pader Baltzsar of Budejovice, with his report of the flooding of the Moltava on the 23rd, 24th, 25th, and 26th days of March in the 1270th Year of Grace. May God guide me to report aright. Amen.\\n\\n Pursuant to the Episcopus\u0027 instructions issued in his capacity as deputy to Przemysl Otakar II in his absence, I have now completed my initial inspection of the countryside for ten leagues upriver and ten leagues downriver and herewith offer my observations for your considerations.\\n\\n The tillers of the fields tell me that at least one third of all they have planted is lost. Some may be planted again, but they will not have a full harvest even if they plow and plant again. No assessments of orchards and vineyards has yet been made. The current loss of livestock for the region I have covered stands at 162 drowned cattle, 248 drowned goats, 429 drowned sheep, 754 drowned chickens, 127 drowned geese, 81 drowned horses, 96 drowned asses, 722 drowned swine, 358 drowned dogs. Of the peasants themselves, 16 men have drowned, 24 women, and 53 children; there may be more, but these are all that have been reported to the priests and monasteries, most of whose losses are accounted in these figures, with the sole exception of the monks of the Monastery of the Holy Martyrs, where all but six of the monks there have perished. Not all the bodies have been found, but they will receive the blessing of the Church and burial in sacred ground when they are.\\n\\n Uncounted numbers of peasants are without food or shelter, and only two monasteries are in good enough repair to take them in: Sant-Phedor and Sant-Weilant, and they are strained to the limit. Food is needed in both establishments if the peasants who survived the flood are not to starve instead. I beseech both you, Episcopus, and you, Counselors, to gather together as much foodstuffs as you can spare and dispatch wagon-loads of bread, cheese, sausages, and wine to help relieve the monks who have extended their charity to these unfortunates.\\n\\n Eleven roads are in great need of repair, three bridges have been washed away entirely, leaving only their foundations behind, and another five are badly damaged, including two which will be used by the Konig and his men for their triumphal return, and therefore must be brought into good repair as soon as may be. Masons and woodmen will be needed to begin the rebuilding as soon as they may be dispatched so that they may begin their work.\\n\\n I will revisit all the places I have seen in another week and prepare an amended report to this one for your perusal.\\n\\n Gloria in excelsis Deo, et pacem in terris,\\n\\n Baltzsar of Budejovice\\n\\n Trinitarian Pader \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-embarrassment-of-riches-saint-germain-24/page-19.html","bookId":2506,"book":{"id":2506,"title":"An Embarrassment of Riches (Saint-Germain #24)","description":"Storyline: An Embarrassment of Riches (Saint-Germain #24) \\n More than two decades strong, the Saint-Germain cycle is one of the most compelling works of dark fantasy and horror of our age. Historically accurate, often involving key events or figures from throughout world history, these deeply emotional novels have a devoted readership. Each novel is written as a stand-alone and they are not chronologically consecutive, so readers may enter the saga with any book and move backward or forward in time as they choose, from Pharaonic Egypt to Paris in the 1700s, from the fall of the Roman Empire to World War II Europe. \\n In An Embarrassment of Riches, the vampire Count finds himself a virtual prisoner in the Court of Kunigunde in Bohemia in the 1200s. Rakoczy Ferncsi, as Saint-Germain is known, passes his days making jewels to delight Queen Kunigunde and trying not to become involved in the Court\u0027s intrigues. In this, the vampire fails. Handsome, apparently wealthy, and obviously unmarried, he soon finds himself being sexually blackmailed by Rozsa, an ambitious lady-in-waiting. If he does not satisfy her, she will denounce him to the priests and he\u0027ll be burned at the stake, resulting in his True Death. Despite his care, the vampire makes more than one enemy at the Bohemian Court, and by the end of An Embarrassment of Riches, the Count can see only one road to freedom...through death.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/an-embarrassment-of-riches-saint-germain-24.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/an-embarrassment-of-riches-saint-germain-24.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:36 PM"}}
