{"id":13526,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXV The Merry Men Score Goals","content":"In football garb the Squirms, on the whole, looked unimpressive. They had bulk, but it was beef without brawn. Some of them had so outgrown their togs that their arms stuck out sideways, in a grotesque semi-circular fashion. Others had fat faces, too, which turned unhealthily blue in the wind. \"What a mug\u0027s game it is,\" grumbled Grain. \"We\u0027re prize idiots to appear at all.\" \"Couldn\u0027t honourably do otherwise,\" retorted Osbody. \"Honour be hanged! We\u0027re not heroes of a sporting novel. Look at the crowd of Foxes round the ropes. They\u0027ve come to laugh at us!\" \"Perhaps they\u0027ll cheer us before we\u0027ve finished.\" \"Rubbish! We\u0027re all as soft as putty. Given football a miss whenever possible. Hated the muddy misery of it. The Merry Men will tie us into every kind of knot.\" \"Shut up, fusspot!\" said Osbody, with spirit. \"It\u0027s rotten bad form to cry \u0027stinking fish\u0027.\" \"Rather!\" agreed Niblo. \"Where\u0027s the sense of piling up imaginary goals against your own side, Grain? Grouse when they\u0027re actually scored, not before.\" \"You\u0027re living in a fool\u0027s paradise,\" retorted Grain. \"Go on kidding yourselves that you\u0027re an International side. All I can say is, that you don\u0027t jolly well look it. More like a row of plucked turkeys outside a poulterer\u0027s shop.\" His bitter comments were interrupted by the arrival of the Merry Men, looking fit as fiddles in their white shirts and blue knickers. Rosy-cheeked and bright-eyed, full of vim and confidence, they formed a striking contrast to their shivering opponents. Judging by appearances, there would only be one team in the picture that afternoon. Osbody, as captain, met Arkness in the centre of the field. \"Who\u0027s to referee?\" he inquired. \"I forgot to ask about that.\" \"That\u0027s all right,\" Robin answered cheerily. \"Thought we\u0027d have a good \u0027un while we were about it. I\u0027ve asked Forge to take the whistle.\" \"You never dared!\" cried Osbody, evidently taken aback. \"Why not? Forge doesn\u0027t bite. What better \u0027ref.\u0027 could we have? He\u0027ll see fair play to the last kick.\" \"Who said there was going to be any play that wasn\u0027t fair?\" asked Osbody, ungraciously. \"Not I, you thin-skinned beggar. All I meant was that Forge knows the rules backwards way. He\u0027ll hold the scales even and favour neither side.\" \"That\u0027s as may be,\" remarked Grain. He had come up behind them with his customary cheek to butt into the conversation. \"Some people know how to wangle things. Even school-captains swallow butter occasionally.\" Robin looked at Grain with cold contempt. \"Here comes Forge,\" he said. \"Time to start. If you\u0027ll ask your men to stand back, Osbody, we\u0027ll toss for ends.\" A cordial cheer greeted Forge, who concealed an amused smile with difficulty as he saw, through the corner of his eye, the long faces the Squirms were pulling at his appearance. Doubtless they would have preferred a milder and shorter-sighted referee. Dick shook hands with both captains in a manner of becoming gravity. It might have been a First League match, so seriously did he take it. \"Good afternoon, chaps,\" he said. \"Ideal afternoon for footer. Winning the toss won\u0027t help either of you much. Hope we\u0027ll have a pleasant game.\" The news that Dick was refereeing quickly spread. It was a totally unexpected honour for a junior match. Usually the captain was too busy leather-hunting himself to take any notice of scratch games. That he had decided to referee this contest between the Merry Men and the Squirms excited curiosity, resulting in a rapid thickening of the ring of spectators round the ropes. It was all very depressing to the Squirms. They had hoped against hope that the crowd of onlookers would be small, having a lively fear that they were bound to make fools of themselves. The advent of the captain as referee had turned the limelight full on them, and more than half Foxenby would now be present to deride their floundering efforts at football. \"Arkness did it on purpose, the crafty bounder,\" they told one another. \"This is his revenge for the tournament licking. Nice figures of fun we\u0027ll look after a bit.\" \"Buck up, chaps, and put all in,\" Osbody counselled them. \"We\u0027re eleven against eleven, after all. Use your weight and knock some of the steam out of them at the start.\" With Niblo in goal, and himself at left full-back, the captain of the Squirms really made a gallant attempt to save his side from immediate humiliation. Doing the work of three players, he nipped in time after time to throw the Merry Men\u0027s scoring schemes awry. His only mistake in the first fifteen minutes was to bring Robin down somewhat roughly when a goal seemed certain. Forge took a charitable view of the foul and merely awarded an ordinary free kick. This Niblo, who was playing a surprisingly good game, fisted away with convincing force. \"We\u0027re doing top-hole, chaps,\" Osbody told the Squirms. \"Get farther down the field, you forwards, and chance your luck more.\" Grain could play decently enough at centre-forward when he liked, but was lazy by nature and a confirmed grumbler. \"Talking\u0027s easy,\" he sneered. \"Fat lot of attacking you\u0027d do yourself if you\u0027d two sugar babies instead of players at each side of you.\" \"Try a gallop on your own anyhow, Grain. You\u0027re big enough.\" \"I see. Plenty for them to kick at, you mean. Hadn\u0027t you better get back towards goal, \u0027Body, before the squibs go off?\" Truly, Osbody had been caught napping. The ball had been restarted while he was talking, and Dave and Robin had lured the other full-back into a booby-trap. He zigzagged in bewilderment towards Niblo, whose toes he trod on, with the result that the hampered goalkeeper had the mortification of seeing the ball lobbed past him for the first goal of the match. \"You clumsy clown!\" he cried to the faulty fullback. \"Either keep off my toes or get off the field. You gave them that goal!\" Bad temper is the worst opponent a goalkeeper can have. While he remained cool Niblo had kept goal excellently well; now that he was hot and cross he could do nothing right. Robin beat him again with quite a simple shot; Dave bagged a couple more in as many minutes, and the thrashing which the Squirms themselves had expected began in real earnest. Niblo\u0027s sole occupation seemed to be that of picking the ball from the back of the net and booting it savagely back to the centre of the field. Osbody wiped his forehead in miserable perplexity. \"Nine goals to nil,\" he said. \"This is sheer slaughter, Niblo. Steady, old man, steady!\" \"Right, \u0027Body, old son,\" answered Niblo. \"I lost my head, but they\u0027re all on top of me. Can\u0027t you go to your old place and draw them off me a bit?\" \"Good idea, Niblo. I\u0027ll feel more at home at centre-half, putting a spoke in Arkness\u0027s wheel.\" Grain watched the change with cynical approval. \"Time you came to give me a hand,\" he said. \"The Professor\u0027s no more use behind me than a draughty keyhole.\" \"Have a pot at goal whenever you can, Grain. We must get a chalk or two, or it\u0027ll be \u0027thirty—nil\u0027 on the hall notice-board.\" Between them they managed to get a move on, juggling the ball into the Merry Men\u0027s penalty-area by deft touches which won applause. Osbody was then in a splendid scoring position, and ought to have shot without hesitation. Probably wishing, however, to put Grain in a better temper, he unselfishly gave his grumbling colleague the ball, saying to him: \"Let fly first time, Grain.\" It was what is known as a gift-goal. The Merry Men\u0027s custodian had slipped and fallen, and Grain had only to lift the ball gently into the net. But the excitement of the moment must have unnerved him, for instead of shooting he trod on the ball, which flew up and hit him in the face. The next moment, to the accompaniment of a loud roar of laughter, he had sprawled full length in the mud. There was mud on this particular patch of the field, too. It was facetiously called the \"Nigger Pond\", because on most days a pool of black water was present there. If Grain had been in the habit of practising more he would have remembered this patch and kept clear of it. But now he was wholly in it from head to foot, sending a fountain of black drops over Osbody also, and (what was worse still from his captain\u0027s standpoint) spoiling all chance of a score by accidentally fisting the ball over the goal-line. When, at last, he managed to raise himself dolefully to his feet, who was there on the field who could have refrained from grinning at him? Black he was, but not in any way comely. His appearance was that of a golliwog too tightly stuffed with sawdust—an irresistibly comical sight. The spectators exploded with mirth; the Squirms laughed even louder than the Merry Men; Forge himself could not keep a straight face, and laughed aloud with the rest. Only Grain failed to see the broad humour of the thing. \"Keep it up, you blinking idiots!\" he snorted, as he flung the mud from his blazing eyes. \"Pretty cads you all are to make game of a fellow\u0027s misery.\" \"Cut off and change, Grain,\" Dick advised him. \"So I will, and I shan\u0027t come back,\" whined Grain. \"Nonsense,\" Dick returned. \"Take it in good part, youngster. Your side needs you. Play the game.\" Grain ran off sulkily, and at half-time, when the Merry Men had a dozen goals to their credit, he had washed off the mud and made himself presentable in a clean costume from the emergency kit. \"That\u0027s right, kid,\" Dick said to him. \"You\u0027re going in again. Better luck next time.\" Grain grunted something in an off-hand manner—a piece of surly cheek which Dick tactfully ignored. But the captain of the school decided to keep a watchful eye on this unmannerly young Squirm, whose ways were far from being ways of pleasantness. The bulk of the crowd had melted away at half-time, the game being too one-sided to hold their attention. It was just target practice for the Merry Men\u0027s forwards and halves, and runaway victories quickly pall on unbiassed spectators. But it gradually became evident that the play was becoming too warm for some of the combatants. Cries of \"Stop that, you dirty cad!\" were audible at intervals, and Dick had at last to push himself unceremoniously between two sparring opponents, one of whom was painfully hopping up and down on a bruised leg. \"That\u0027ll do, Storm—that\u0027s enough, Grain,\" said Dick. \"This is a football-field, not a rat-pit.\" \"I was nowhere near the ball when he hacked me,\" pleaded Dave. \"Rot!\" said Grain. \"You fell over my foot. I\u0027m as much hurt as you.\" \"Better temper, please,\" said Dick, restarting the game. But this time he paid less heed to the play in general than to the movements of Grain in particular. Very soon he saw something which confirmed his suspicions. Pretending to head a ball which was nowhere near him, Grain scraped some skin off Arkness\u0027s knees with his boot, while striking the back of his hand against Tom Jaye\u0027s nose, causing that organ to bleed a little. Dick promptly blew his whistle and ran to the scene. \"Free kick against you, Grain,\" he announced. \"Don\u0027t be more like a windmill than you can help. It\u0027s dangerous!\" Grain smiled in a supercilious sort of way, and, folding his arms like a gladiator, contemptuously watched Dave take the free kick. To show how utterly a word in season was lost on him, the next minute he literally jumped, knees up, into Allan a Dale\u0027s back, sending that lightly-built and altogether harmless Merry Man somersaulting over the ropes. \"Here, stop rotting, you lout!\" cried Robin, his blood boiling. Grain\u0027s immediate answer was an uplifted fist and a vicious blow at Robin\u0027s face. Robin saved his beauty, not to mention a considerable amount of sticking-plaster, by ducking swiftly and taking the hard smack on his shoulder. There were cries of indignant disgust from players and spectators alike. \"How\u0027s that for dirty play, referee?\" somebody shouted. Dick needed no such reminder of his duty. Like an avenging force he fell upon Grain and gripped the Squirm\u0027s arm. \"Clear off the field, Grain!\" he commanded. \"Out of it. March!\" \"Ridiculous,\" protested Grain. \"I only charged a man off the ball.\" \"You might have snapped his backbone like a carrot. Make yourself scarce and don\u0027t argue.\" But Grain did argue. To the awed amazement of both Squirms and Merry Men, he fired a lot of audacious back-talk at the grimly-silent captain. \"You can\u0027t send me off, Forge,\" he declared. \"Haven\u0027t power to. This isn\u0027t a league match or a cup-tie. You weren\u0027t asked to referee—at least, not by our side. I\u0027ve done no harm; why should I go?\" \"Never mind the why and the wherefore,\" snapped the captain. \"Take yourself off.\" Grain looked round at the frightened faces watching him, and had a mind to show them what a devil-may-care fellow he was. \"Shan\u0027t!\" he answered, with a stupidly defiant laugh. He was asking for trouble there, and did not seek in vain. Round the back of his neck Forge\u0027s fingers fastened like a vice. He next felt himself lifted over the ropes as though he were no more than a bag of shavings, and at a furious and undignified speed he was hustled to the gate of the football-field and pitched into the lane. HE NEXT FELT HIMSELF LIFTED OVER THE ROPES HE NEXT FELT HIMSELF LIFTED OVER THE ROPES \"Stay there till the dust-cart picks you up, you vermin,\" said Dick, with withering scorn. After that the game was better and brighter. Nobody said anything, but everybody felt that a spirit of mischief had been erased from the match. Osbody fell back to defend again, and he and Niblo put up so stout a defence that the Merry Men could only score twice more before Dick\u0027s whistle blew for time. Still, twenty-three goals to none represented a terrible drubbing for the Squirms, and one that made their tournament victory seem a very feeble triumph indeed. Yet nobody seemed the least inclined to rub the licking in. The Squirms, with one conspicuous exception, had played a clean game, and kept their tempers in humiliating circumstances. Just, then, as they were trooping dejectedly from the field, they were electrified by hearing Robin\u0027s familiar treble calling out: \"Three cheers for Osbody\u0027s team, you fellows—hip, hip, hooray!\" Forge turned to listen in smiling approval as the Merry Men whole-heartedly gave three cheers. Osbody blushed like a girl and gazed apprehensively round at the Squirms, wondering how they would take this totally unexpected outburst. Then, swinging his arm round his head, he cried to them: \"Three cheers for the winners, you chaps.\" What matter that the Squirms\u0027 cheers were but throaty croaks compared with the full-voiced hurrahs of the Merry Men? They did their best in an unaccustomed part, plainly realizing that their honourable foes had treated them in a thoroughly sporting spirit. Not to have responded in a similar vein would have disgraced them in Foxenby\u0027s eyes. Glancing at one another sheepishly, they made haste to leave the field, but were overtaken by Dick Forge, who accommodated his pace to theirs. \"You chaps look down in the mouth,\" the captain said, briskly. \"Don\u0027t be. You\u0027ve no need. There\u0027s quite decent footer in some of you. All you require is practice. You\u0027ve played particularly well, Osbody. Ditto you, Niblo.\" The two leading Squirms flushed with unconcealed delight at this compliment from Foxenby\u0027s greatest footballer. \"But—but they made all sorts of rings round us, Forge,\" Osbody stammered. \"True. Served you right. You loafed about indoors, getting flabbier than jellyfish, while Arkness and Co. hardened themselves outside. I am pretty keen on footer, as you know, boys. When a Fox has legs to stand on I like to see him chasing a ball with them, even if he never catches up with it. Now, tell me, are you chaps game to stick together and practise footer every week, for the honour of Foxenby?\" A quick little catching of breath was audible here and there. What could the Squirms do when the great captain of Foxenby was pleading with them thus? His whole heart was in his voice—his deadly earnestness could not be mistaken. The meanest boy amongst them knew how passionately Forge loved Foxenby, and his pure devotion to its interests was infectious. \"Why, of course, Forge, we\u0027ll practise like the very dickens—won\u0027t we, you chaps?\" said Osbody, turning on them a pair of eyes that shone with new resolution. \"Rather!\" they answered, in somewhat tremulous chorus. \"Good biz,\" commented Forge, as he turned aside into Rooke\u0027s House. \"It bucks me up no end to hear you say so.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2760/76184.html","bookId":1342,"book":{"id":1342,"title":"Forge of Foxenby","description":"简介： But, until the ball is seen resting in the back of the net, it is as unwise to count a goal as it is to reckon chickens still in the shell.
