{"id":13520,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX Roger returns to Brighter Skies","content":"Immediately after breakfast the Head called the boys together in the hall and gave them a graphic account of the recovery of his collection, praising the blushing captain sky-high. Then he gave the school a holiday, and topped it by declaring that \"some very special dainties\" would be provided for supper that night. It was a red-letter day all round. Robin Hood and his Merry Men held high revelry in the Forest, and even called a truce with the Squirms so that there might be no shadow on the day\u0027s sunshine. They were not tempted from grace, either, by the red-rag irritation of Peter Mawdster\u0027s presence. That sick and sorry youth took advantage of the holiday to slip down home, and, for some reason never publicly explained, he was seen at Foxenby no more. Possibly his doting parents decided to remove him to a less robust and more genteel atmosphere than that which Foxenby afforded. Anyhow, his disappearance had no more effect on the school than the swift death of a midge in a summer thunderstorm. Dick took his fifty-pound cheque to the head-master\u0027s bank and withdrew thirty-five pounds of it, leaving the remainder on deposit in his own name. Then he hunted up \"Chuck\" Smithies, who was amusing himself by turning over a portfolio of old sporting prints. \"Hallo, sonny! Come to tell me how you ticked off that jelly-fish, Aaron Mawdster, yesterday afternoon? I can see by your face that you wrung the low-down animal\u0027s withers for him!\" \"Thanks to you, I metaphorically mopped him up,\" said Dick. The bookmaker roared with laughter over Dick\u0027s unvarnished account of the printing-office interview, in which the captain had seen nothing particularly funny at the time. \"You rattled the hypocrite\u0027s teeth with a rasping upper-cut there, lad,\" said Smithies. \"Oh, I\u0027ll laugh till I cry! Threatening to expose him as a blackmailer got right through his sanctimonious guard. He\u0027d dread that. You could have bowled him out with it, whether you\u0027d paid him or not.\" \"I paid him, though. He took all you lent me and some odd shillings besides.\" \"Exactly what he would do, the dirty blighter! But here, I say, what are you trying on, youngster? Repaying me already?\" He stared almost resentfully at the thirty-five pounds which Dick laid before him. \"Been picking paper-money off trees, kid, or what is it? Pardon me if I seem dazed, but——\" \"Please take it, Smithies. I\u0027d the luck of a lifetime yesterday.\" Briefly Dick described his moonlit trip to the hills with Fluffy Jim, and what came of it. \"So, you see, I can repay your kind loan with a balance in hand.\" What seemed distinctly like a shade of annoyance crossed the bookmaker\u0027s face. \"Sonny, we parted on good terms yesterday—don\u0027t strew tacks under the wheel of friendship to-day. Am I Shylock, that you should plunk down a fiver for a day\u0027s interest on thirty pounds? I\u0027ll take back what I lent you and not a penny more.\" Dick felt rather foolish. \"But you said it was a business transaction,\" he replied, defensively. \"I\u0027m most awfully sorry if I\u0027ve unwittingly hurt your feelings—do please forgive me for being such a clown. I—I only thought it would be rather nice to make you a little friendly acknowledgment of your great kindness.\" \"Well, you\u0027ve put it on the wrong footing, youngster, that\u0027s all. \u0027Business transaction\u0027 was my camouflage for it. Just a loan to oblige a pal—which it did, thank goodness, in putting you top-side of Aaron Mawdster yesterday. There, now, take no notice of my bluster—I\u0027m only kidding. Take back your fiver and give me instead a little souvenir of the occasion—one I rather fancy.\" \"Whatever it is, it\u0027s yours, Smithies,\" Dick eagerly agreed. \"A photograph of yourself in football togs—this size—to fit into my portfolio of sporting cracks.\" \"The honour\u0027s mine there,\" said Dick. He bethought himself of Robin Arkness\u0027s autograph-book, and smiled. \"You\u0027re putting me early into the gallery of Fame! I hate being photographed, Smithies, but you shall have the picture. Mr. Rooke will take it—he\u0027s a wizard with a camera.\" \"That\u0027ll suit me down to the ground, sonny. It\u0027ll be a nice memento to put beside a photograph of the football cup, which you\u0027re sure to win next time. \"For,\" added the bookmaker inwardly, as Dick left the office, \"I\u0027m taking no bets on that replay from Ike Doccan\u0027s dirty paw. If he wasn\u0027t acting for a few schoolboys who meant Foxenby no good, I\u0027ll eat my go-to-meeting suit of clothes.\" Dick had swung happily half-way back to school when he observed Robin Arkness running towards him breathlessly. The Junior waved at him an orange-coloured envelope. \"A telegram for you, Forge,\" he announced. \"I saw you come down here, so I risked bringing it along.\" \"Jolly decent of you, youngster—thanks,\" said Dick, trying to behave as though telegrams were an everyday event with him, though his pulse was rapid as he opened the envelope and read its contents. \"Kid, what splendid news you\u0027ve brought me! Cayton is coming back to school by the midday train, and wants me to meet him. We\u0027ve just time to celebrate it. Come and have a lemonade or something.\" The \"something\" spread itself out into quite a classy midday feed for Robin, who, having done himself proud at the smiling captain\u0027s expense, hurried back to school to scatter envy among his less fortunate comrades. It was then time for the train, which brought with it a paler but much-happier-looking Roger than the anxious prefect who left Foxenby in December. \"Why, Roger, old boy,\" said Dick, when they had treated themselves to a very fervent handshake, \"I expected to see you a limping crock, looking justifiably sorry for yourself, yet you\u0027re laughing all across your face and half-way down your back. Does being feverishly ill buck a chap up so much as all that?\" \"Dear old Dick, I meant to keep it dark till we were locked in our study to-night, but I simply can\u0027t hold it in. It\u0027s ripping tidings I\u0027ve got for you—top-hole!\" \"Judging by your beaming countenance, it must be.\" \"Laddie, it\u0027s great! I\u0027m no longer a \u0027deadhead\u0027, financially speaking, in the Rooke\u0027s House Rag partnership. I can go shares in the cost, whatever it is. I\u0027ve made money—I\u0027m a professional author!\" \"No, never! Get away with your nonsense, Roger!\" \"It\u0027s sober truth, old Doubting Thomas. I\u0027ve a savings-bank book in my pocket, showing that twenty guineas is standing to my credit. And every penny of that was made by writing—I\u0027ve the proofs of the series of sketches in my pocket, and you and I are going to correct them together to-night!\" He had an enraptured and admiring auditor in Dick as he explained how, determined to do his bit towards making good the loss of the Rag\u0027s subscription-money, he had conceived the idea of writing a dialect sketch descriptive of the quaint customs and mannerisms of his own village. By great good fortune the simple humour of it had caught the fancy of the first editor to whom he offered it. \"Send me eleven more brief sketches in the same vein,\" wrote the editor, \"and I\u0027ll pay you twenty guineas for the dozen.\" It was, Roger admitted, a staggering commission, and ultimately it overweighted him. What with tramping about in search of \"local colour\" in the daytime, and then sitting up secretly at nights in order to transfer his thoughts to paper, he broke down, and only just finished the job in time—indeed, he had no recollection of actually posting the series, and was only certain he had done so when, a few days before returning to school, he had received the promised cheque in payment. \"There was absolutely nothing in them, old chap—the simplest stuff you could imagine. I said as much to the editor-chap, who replied that their simplicity was their charm. I just jotted down the fairy-stories of the district, and described the funny folk who told them, and it clicked.\" \"You\u0027re a wise old bird, Roger,\" said Dick, almost worshipping this revelation of his chum\u0027s intellect. \"I shall put a special paragraph in the new Rag about all this—yes, I shall—I\u0027m editor-in-chief, so you can\u0027t stop me. Now, it\u0027s your turn to listen to me, and I think my tale about even beats yours, old lad!\" An opinion which Roger emphatically confirmed when, despite many excited interruptions from him, Dick had completed the yarn. \"Great!\" commented Roger. \"A thrill from beginning to end. Isn\u0027t it strange how things work out? Grand bit of compensation that Fluffy Jim, after spoiling your goal, should put that fifty-pound reward right under your nose. Rough gratitude for your services in snatching him from Juddy Stockgill\u0027s clutches, though he only meant to show you his \u0027cottage musical-box\u0027.\" They spent a happy afternoon in their study, exchanging confidences over the fire concerning almost everything that had happened during their enforced separation. One thing, and one thing only, did Dick keep from Roger, and that was his suspicion that Luke Harwood had had some hand in messing up the final tie. He wanted to bring an unprejudiced mind to that subject when he discussed it with Luke, which he fully intended to do at the first opportunity. By dusk Roger knew nearly as much about Foxenby\u0027s affairs as if illness had not kept him away. He was sympathetic about the misfortune that had overtaken Dick\u0027s aunt, but rather thought that he would personally be able to make up for any loss of pocket-money in that direction by writing more sketches for the Press. Which shows how little success is needed to make an amateur author vain. \"The Rag must come out again,\" he said, \"and that right speedily. The firm that prints the Foxonian shall do it for us this time—they\u0027re clean and above reproach.\" \"Right you are,\" said Dick. \"I\u0027m game. In an hour the fellows will be trooping in to supper which the Old Man is making a toothsome event to-night. On their way they\u0027ll pass the notice-board.\" And thus it happened that, after a happy day of unexpected liberty, the Foxes were able to read more sympathetically than they would have done a day or two before, the following intimation on the hall notice-board:— THE ROOKE\u0027S HOUSE RAG The Editors of the above Magazine have pleasure in informing its readers that its publication will be resumed within the course of a few weeks. It is hoped to introduce some new features of special interest in the forthcoming number. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2760/76178.html","bookId":1342,"book":{"id":1342,"title":"Forge of Foxenby","description":"简介： But, until the ball is seen resting in the back of the net, it is as unwise to count a goal as it is to reckon chickens still in the shell.
