{"id":13513,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII The Printer is Polite no Longer","content":"Christmas appeared to have upset the liver of the printer of The Rooke\u0027s House Rag. He was half-way down Dick\u0027s throat, in a manner of speaking, the moment that unfortunate young editor entered the works. \"There\u0027ll be no more copies of your precious magazine issued from this establishment, I warn you,\" he flared. \"Call yourself captain of a gentlemen\u0027s school! You\u0027re captain of a lot of prigs and bullies, that\u0027s what you are!\" Dick was getting used to reverses of fortune nowadays, and he received this outburst calmly. \"I\u0027ve some recollection that you called me the soul of honour last term,\" he replied. \"Now you apparently think me a hooligan.\" \"I didn\u0027t say that. But you\u0027re a captain of hooligans all the same, Mr. Forge. A nice life you let them lead my poor boy last term! I sent him to Foxenby to learn to be a gentleman—not having had the advantages of a public-school education myself—and instead he\u0027s set-upon and browbeaten daily by gangs of young blackguards, and you never lift a finger to protect him.\" Dick looked bewildered. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" he said. \"How, please, does this concern me? Your son at Foxenby! Who, pray, may that be?\" \"My name is Mawdster, and my son\u0027s name is Peter. Now, perhaps you\u0027ll \u0027get\u0027 me. My poor, delicate boy has been shockingly ill-treated, and you\u0027ve stood by and looked on. Come, you don\u0027t deny it, Mr. Forge.\" This was truly an eye-opener to Dick. Clear as noonday now became the mystery of young Mawdster\u0027s championship of the Rag. That parting shot of his, in which he had told the co-editors that he had not meant to praise the contents of the Rag, but only its printing and \"make-up\", was fully explained. The manager of the Cleartype Press and the fat, unhealthy Squirm were father and son. \"Well, Mr. Mawdster, I admit that your boy has become unpopular with his class-mates, but he boards in Holbeck\u0027s House and is therefore not under my protection. His remedy for ill-treatment lies with his own prefect and housemaster. I cannot interfere in any circumstances.\" \"Oh, can\u0027t you, Mr. High-and-mighty Captain!\" snarled the manager, mocking Dick\u0027s dignified tones. \"But you\u0027ll jolly well have to, or I\u0027ll know the reason why. You\u0027ve got into my ribs for a lot of money—more perhaps than you dream of—and I guess I hold the whip-hand of you all right. You\u0027ll either take my poor boy\u0027s part at Foxenby or sup sorrow, Mr. Forge.\" \"Don\u0027t be vulgar, and don\u0027t be absurd, Mr. Mawdster. Keep business and private affairs apart. Admittedly, I cannot pay you yet for publishing the magazine, but on that account you shall not blackmail me.\" At this the manager suddenly dropped his threatening manner, and became more like his old suave self. He commenced to wheedle. \"Look here, Mr. Forge, don\u0027t let us quarrel, you and me,\" he said. \"You\u0027ve got a rare lot of power at Foxenby if you like to use it. I appeal to you as a father. I love my boy—he\u0027s the only child we\u0027ve got, and it cost a little fortune to rear him, he was so weak at first. But I\u0027d spend another fortune—ay, all I\u0027ve got in the world—to see him happy and to know he was making nice chums amongst gentlemen\u0027s sons up yonder. Stop them bullyin\u0027 him, Mr. Forge, and—and——\" \"And what?\" asked Dick. \"And I\u0027ll present you with a signed receipt for every penny that your magazine has cost me,\" the printer blurted out. \"I say, that\u0027s fair, isn\u0027t it? You couldn\u0027t have a more sporting offer.\" Beneath his calm exterior Dick was conscious of a heart that beat quickly and uncomfortably. Here, if he could bring himself to adopt it, was a way out of all his difficulties! But he gave no second thought to the temptation. \"It is neither a sporting offer nor a workable one, Mr. Mawdster,\" he answered, without hesitation. \"I am sorry you are unhappy about your son, but I can do nothing for him.\" \"What! You, the Captain of Foxenby, can\u0027t save my poor lad from being beaten black and blue?\" \"I have told you I cannot. It would be an unpardonable breach of school etiquette.\" \"Etiquette be blowed!\" cried the manager. \"You\u0027ve got to stick up for my boy, or else——\" \"drop that, Mr. Mawdster. I won\u0027t be threatened. If you are dissatisfied with your son\u0027s treatment, why don\u0027t you write to his housemaster, or direct to the Head himself?\" \"And have the poor, dear lad hounded out of the place as a tell-tale! Not much, young fellow—he\u0027s suffered enough already without that. See here, Mr. Stiff-neck Forge, you and I have got to have a straight talk about this editorial stunt of yours.\" \"Certainly. That\u0027s why I came here so soon.\" \"I\u0027ve published three numbers of the magazine on art paper, and they\u0027ve cost a lot of money. If I pass you the bill now, can you pay it?\" \"I\u0027m sorry to say I cannot.\" \"Very well, then. You\u0027re a minor, and therefore I can\u0027t sue you in the County Court. I knew of that risk when I took your job on, but I trusted to your honour as a gentleman.\" \"You shall be paid every farthing in the end.\" \"So you say! But I\u0027m not prepared to wait. Either you\u0027ll pay now, on the nail, or you\u0027ll protect my boy from insult and injury!\" \"I have already explained that I can do neither.\" The two faced each other angrily now. No quarter was asked or given. \"Is that your last word, Mr. Forge?\" \"Quite!\" \"Then your blood be on your own stupid head. A fortnight from to-day, when your next number is due to be published, I shall go to your headmaster and tell him how you\u0027ve let me in! Politely ask him, I shall, to write to your people about it, or to give me their address so\u0027s I can write them myself.\" At once Dick\u0027s thoughts turned home in alarm to his distressed aunt and disdainful stepmother. There were strong reasons, of a different character, why neither should know of his humiliating bother. \"Oh, don\u0027t do that, Mr. Mawdster, please!\" he pleaded. \"Ah, that touches you, does it?\" sneered the printer. \"You wince now, my proud young aristocrat. Well, I rather thought you\u0027d see reason in the end. You\u0027ve got a fortnight\u0027s grace. Stretch a protectin\u0027 wing over my poor, delicate boy, and all will be well. Be pig-headed, and it won\u0027t! Your people will know all about it, and so will the whole school. Nice pie for the editor of The Foxonian, eh? He won\u0027t half smack his lips over it!\" These were the taunting words which followed Dick through the doorway as he wisely decided to go. It was a relief to pass from the stuffy printing-office into the clear air of a frosty January afternoon. Out in the street he had rather less of the feeling of a rat caught hopelessly in a trap. \"The beggar has me by the throat,\" he groaned inwardly. \"Either I\u0027ve got to save the skin of his corpulent skunk of a son, or be shown up at home and here as a fellow who doesn\u0027t pay his debts. Dear old Roger little guessed what a rod he was making for my back when he egged me on to start journalism.\" It was the Moston half-holiday, and farm-lads were strolling about in their best bell-bottomed trousers, in search of more amusement than the little place was capable of providing. Some of them had gathered in the Tavern Square, and were entertaining themselves by roughly baiting Fluffy Jim, the village idiot. One big rustic, probably about eighteen years of age, though he had the beginnings of a strong beard on his unbarbered chin, was holding Fluffy Jim\u0027s head tightly between his legs while the other lads took turns at knocking dust out of the idiot\u0027s clothes with the ash-sticks and canes they carried. \"Nah then, yo\u0027 chaps, let drive at him,\" shouted the biggest tyrant. \"Iverybody as makes him \u0027bale oot\u0027 sco?ars one point, and them chaps \u0027at he \u0027shoots\u0027 mo?ast for gets a fat cigar apiece!\" To \"bale oot\" and to \"shoot\" meant the same thing in the dialect of the district—the poor half-witted boy was to be made to shout out in pain beneath the succession of strokes, and from this cruel pastime the yokels were obviously deriving coarse amusement. Now, Dick had no reason to feel tenderly disposed towards the village idiot, who had had so much to do with one of the greatest disappointments of his life. Nevertheless his blood boiled as he joined the little crowd of watchers, some of them elderly men, and realized that, far from showing any desire to interfere, they seemed actually to be enjoying the \"fun\". Dick had meant going straight into the inn to claim the shelter of the snug little private room which he had booked. His brain was in a whirl, and above everything he craved quietude. His last wish was to be mixed up in a brawl with skylarking farm-hands. The Captain of Foxenby could not really afford the luxury of a \"scrap\" in the open street. A very genuine howl of agony from Fluffy Jim settled the matter, however. Dick suddenly appeared in the centre of the laughing rustics, and tapped the leader of them on the shoulder. \"That\u0027ll do, you,\" he said, curtly. \"Let Fluffy Jim go. He\u0027s had enough knocking about for to-day.\" The young horseman gaped, as well he might, for this was an audacious thing that the Foxenby schoolboy had done. The square was thick with the yokel\u0027s friends, a united rush by whom would speedily have put the intruder out and under. \"Oh, by gum! An\u0027 who\u0027s thee when tha\u0027re at ho?am?\" inquired the horseman. \"Run away to thee mammy, kid, afo?ar tha gets hurt!\" Great laughter rewarded this outburst of rural wit. But Dick\u0027s reply, eagerly awaited, was not in words. Catching hold of the yokel\u0027s neckcloth he jerked him smartly back, thereby releasing Fluffy Jim from that unhappy youth\u0027s painful position. In an instant there was angry uproar. \"Hit \u0027im in t\u0027mooth, Juddy! Clart \u0027im in t\u0027lug, lad! Rub \u0027is cheeky nose in t\u0027snow, Juddy, boy!\" Thus urged on all sides to action, \"Juddy\" bunched together a fist of terrifying size, swung it round a few times to emphasize its power, and then lifted it carefully to the level of Dick\u0027s eyes. \"See that?\" he said. \"It\u0027s what tha\u0027re goin\u0027 to get for interferin\u0027 wi\u0027 the likes o\u0027 me. Ah\u0027ve gi\u0027en thee fair warnin\u0027, so look art!\" \"SEE THAT?\" HE SAID \"SEE THAT?\" HE SAID He drew back his arm to strike, and Dick, secretly somewhat dismayed by the size of the fist he had been invited to inspect, got ready to defend himself. Then it was that the landlord of the \"Anvil Inn\", an old quartermaster-sergeant, took a hand in the game. \"Not here, gentlemen, I beg,\" said he. \"Do you both want to spend a night in the lock-up? There\u0027s the bowling-green behind, nice and handy. If you must fight, come and have it out there!\" This fresh turn of events was still more hateful to Dick, who would have preferred to be done with the unfortunate affair after a quick set-to in the open. But some gratis sport of a thrilling character was exactly what the crowd wanted, and they swept both Dick and the horseman, willy-nilly, on to the snow-covered bowling-green at the rear. \"Now then, gents, you all know me as an old boxer and a clean sportsman,\" the landlord shouted. \"So I\u0027ll be referee and see fair play. Juddy here will have plenty of supporters, but who\u0027s going to hold the sponge for the representative of Foxenby?\" \"I will, old bean,\" said a man at the back of the crowd, which parted to make way for him. \"Give me your coat, youngster. I\u0027ll see you through this all right.\" And it was with a thankful heart that Dick saw \"Chuck\" Smithies, his travelling companion of the previous day, elbowing his way towards him. In this hostile crowd he was now assured of at least one friend! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2760/76171.html","bookId":1342,"book":{"id":1342,"title":"Forge of Foxenby","description":"简介： But, until the ball is seen resting in the back of the net, it is as unwise to count a goal as it is to reckon chickens still in the shell.
