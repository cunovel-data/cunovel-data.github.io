{"id":13502,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II The Captain and \"The Octopus\"","content":"There was more talk than Forge liked in the cramped little dressing-room during the interval. Nevertheless, he grimly held his tongue while those candid advisers, whose speciality is winning football matches with their mouths, put in their interfering oars. \"What killed St. Cuthbert\u0027s pig was the way their backs held aloof till the last few minutes,\" said one. \"Yes,\" agreed another expert. \"If they\u0027d crowded on all sail like that earlier on, they could have walked the ball through.\" \"Rather—by sheer force of numbers,\" chimed in a third. \"We shan\u0027t make that mistake,\" quoth yet another oracle. \"Why, even old Ennis will come out of his hutch and have a pot-shot now and again, won\u0027t you, Ennis?\" Ennis might have been part of the furniture for all the notice he took of this remark. He just sat back in the corner, sprawling out his long legs, and breathing hard. Some of his finger-nails were torn, the backs of his hands wore long scratches, and his knuckles were bruised and bleeding. Smears of mud blackened his face, which he had not yet found energy to sponge. Battered knees and swollen shins, too, were part of the price he had paid for keeping his goal unpierced. None but he knew the aches and pains he had endured to hold the fort for Foxenby. It would be many a long day before his skin was free of scars. \"Here, old man, have a drink of this,\" said Forge, holding to the goalie\u0027s lips a cup of coffee. \"Good stuff, eh? Buck you up no end. Alstone, hurry up with that bowl of warm water. All St. Cuthbert\u0027s have printed their autographs on Ennis\u0027s face.\" The water was hurriedly brought, and Dick sponged the goalie\u0027s features with it as well as he could, what time the babel of voices went on uninterruptedly about them. \"What a narrow squeak when Lyon handled! Looked all over like a penalty to me. Had they got it their \u0027cap.\u0027 would have converted—he never misses a spot-kick.\" \"If we have a penalty Broome must take it. He put three through for Holbeck\u0027s in the practice match last Saturday—didn\u0027t you, Broome?\" \"Shut up!\" snapped Broome, colouring a little. He was still kicking himself for what he had said to Forge before, and was determined in future to leave captaincy to the captain. Luke Harwood, too, thought the time ripe for an exhibition of the good-sportsmanship which he liked to think was a feature of Holbeck\u0027s House. \"Outside, you wiseacres,\" he commanded. \"This is a dressing-room, not a monkey-house. Don\u0027t burn up the team\u0027s oxygen. Don\u0027t speak to the man at the wheel. Other \u0027don\u0027ts\u0027 to follow if you don\u0027t clear quickly.\" He bundled out a few Juniors, and, as if by accident, bustled Roger Cayton too. Roger flushed and side-stepped, but said nothing. He was a slimly-built, spectacled youth, healthy enough, but physically no match for boys of his own age. By pretending to mistake him for one of the batch of Juniors Luke Harwood was, Roger believed, deliberately putting a slight on him. Still, he pursed his lips and swallowed his resentment, and the bit of by-play passed unnoticed by the others. \"All ready again, chaps?\" asked Forge. \"Come on, then. The referee\u0027s piping up.\" Not a word, you will notice, did Forge speak of encouragement or advice. They knew better than to expect \"jaw\" from him, he being one of those wise captains who shout instructions only when the necessity is strong. He expected them all to do their best without any nagging, and to use their own wits in an emergency. \"Now we\u0027ll put it across you, Cuthy,\" said Robin Arkness, as the teams lined up. \"We\u0027re after goals, not \u0027hard lines\u0027 and \u0027try again, boys!\u0027 You\u0027ll be wanting to creep into a rabbit-hole, Cuthy, before we\u0027ve done with you.\" \"Swank!\" retorted Cuthy. \"You can\u0027t get goals against St. Cuthbert\u0027s; nobody ever does.\" All the same, the youthful Cuthbertian\u0027s voice had an anxious tremor in it. He had a lively idea where all the play was likely to be, for he had never budged from his excellent standpoint behind the goal. Nor had Robin and his chums. Even the chance of a warming cup of coffee had failed to lure them away. The Foxenby \"mascot\" stuck there, too, grinning amiably at those who chaffed him about his make-up. The bulk of the spectators, neutral or otherwise, had not moved either. They pulled their overcoats closely about them, and stamped their feet to nullify the effect of the cold wind, which still blew straight towards that particular goal with unabated fury. \"Unless they\u0027ve gotten a goalkeeper as \u0027wick\u0027 as Foxenby—which ain\u0027t to be expected—it\u0027s all ower but shoutin\u0027,\" remarked a Walsbridge rustic. \"Wi\u0027 a wind like this behind me, Ah could sco?ar mesen.\" \"Leave that to us, old boy,\" Robin answered him complacently. \"You won\u0027t have long to wait. See that? Oh, what a top-hole shot, Forge! An inch lower, and he\u0027d have been beaten to the \u0027wide\u0027!\" Indeed, for the past ten minutes one continuous roar of delighted cheering had accompanied Foxenby\u0027s sparkling bombardment of the St. Cuthbert\u0027s goal. Excellent shots went astray by fractions of inches only. Broome twice nearly did damage to the cross-bar, and one crafty \"balloon\" from Forge, over the heads of a bobbing mass of players, was scooped out of the top angle of the goal by the keeper\u0027s finger-tips only. Hundreds of hoarse throats yelled \"Goal!\" prematurely. It was only a corner, which tall Bessingham, the six-foot captain of St. Cuthbert\u0027s, leapt high to head away. \"Whose toes are you jumping on, clumsy?\" grumbled the Junior Cuthbertian, sourly. \"Sorry, Cuthy—I couldn\u0027t help it,\" Robin confessed. \"Simply can\u0027t keep still. It\u0027s our turn for a song and dance this half, you know.\" \"Laugh when you\u0027ve beaten old \u0027Bess\u0027, not before,\" Cuthy cautioned him. There was something in the warning, too. A wonderful boy this reed-like, overgrown Bessingham, with arms always straight to his sides, and legs that seemed everywhere. He could use either foot with equal power, and when his boot caught the ball he made kicking against the wind seem as simple as kicking with it. St. Cuthbert\u0027s called him \"The Octopus\", and by that nickname he was known also to certain Football League Clubs, who wanted him to play for them when he left school. A weird, silent player, ever where the ball was, never seeming to take a useless stride. Those who saw him to-day ceased to marvel at St. Cuthbert\u0027s feat in reaching the final tie without yielding a goal. The seventeen-year-old footballer was a man in all but age, with the cool judgment of a veteran to guide his restless legs. \"Botheration, I can\u0027t dodge him!\" panted Broome to Dick. \"Did you see us mixed together just now? His legs were round my neck. It—it\u0027s clammy—like having snakes crawling over you.\" \"We\u0027ve something to learn from him, Broome,\" said Dick. \"Single combat won\u0027t pay us. We must work round his flanks.\" \"Flanks! Why, he faces all ways,\" Broome groaned. \"Superman, eh! Chuck that, Broome—we\u0027ve got to hammer away till we find his weak spot. Nothing to fear from the forwards, the wind has them in a bottle-neck. Let\u0027s drop this first-time shooting stunt, and try a bit of conjuring.\" \"And he\u0027ll juggle better,\" said Broome, still despairing. Then, brightening up a little, he cried eagerly: \"Here, take that centre from Lake; it\u0027s a ripe cherry, Forge!\" So it was. But the Octopus had a taste for ripe fruit too, and at this particular cherry he had the first bite. Though Dick made quickly for the outside-right\u0027s fine centre, Bessingham matched him. Their boots met the ball together, and the greater force of Bessingham\u0027s kick lifted Dick off his feet. He sprawled yards within the penalty-area, with a conviction that something awkward had happened to his big toe. \"Penalty, penalty!\" roared some of the crowd. It is the habit of football spectators to claim free kicks when things like this happen. To eyes blinded by prejudice it looked as though Dick had been roughly kicked about, but the players and the referee knew better. In a straight-out trial of physical strength, the sturdy captain of Foxenby had come off second-best. Moreover, he limped a little as the result, which was more ominous still. \"What did I tell you, kid?\" said the Junior Cuthbertian, taking heart of grace. \"You can\u0027t get past old \u0027Bess\u0027. Old Bess is a brick wall. Old Bess is a house-side!\" \"He\u0027s a clinking player, I admit,\" said Robin, \"but who\u0027ll pay the doctor\u0027s bill if he kicks somebody\u0027s teeth out?\" \"That\u0027s your affair,\" snapped Cuthy. \"Perhaps you\u0027d like old Bess to play on crutches to give your forwards a chance.\" \"He\u0027s not All England versus The Rest,\" retorted Robin. \"We\u0027ll make rings round him yet.\" Spoken like a true optimist, Robin! But spectators cannot win games, however loyal they may be, and rose-coloured spectacles are as useless in football as in any other field of activity. Bluff could not disguise that the luck had again turned against Foxenby. The sun came out and shone in their eyes and the wind suddenly moderated. Forwards who had stood idly on the half-way line (glad enough to rest after their first-half exertions) now found it possible to pick up Bessingham\u0027s big kicks and move towards Ennis again. True, they kept a respectable distance from Lyon and Lebberston, and only sent in long-range shots with little powder behind them. Ennis, ever reliable, hugged them safely to his breast and punted them back with ease. All very well and good; but each movement in his direction brought relief to St. Cuthbert\u0027s defenders, and cut down Foxenby\u0027s scoring chances at the same time. The gathering behind the top goal thinned a little as some of the crowd drifted speculatively down the field. They thought they saw a prospect of a bit of sport at the other end. There was always a chance of Ennis\u0027s sun-dazzled eyes failing to judge a straight one, however languidly the ball were kicked. Gradually the outlook became darker for the Foxes. Broome appeared to have lost heart and could do nothing right. Atack, the inside-right, quite openly shrank from close contact with the Octopus. He had once chanced his arm in a flying charge at Bessingham, and had been feeling it ever since in the fear that it was dislocated. Lake, bothered by the sun, kept missing his luck entirely and blundering into touch. All he could do, it seemed, was to tread down the flags and inconvenience the linesmen. Meynard, the swift-footed outside-left, certainly kept cool, but that was because he had little to do. He waited in vain to be fed by Broome, who seemed always under Bessingham\u0027s feet. It didn\u0027t mend matters when the Foxenby halves lost patience with the men in front of them and commenced to play hard on top of them. Not being marksmen, they drew upon themselves the ironical contempt of the crowd by shooting high over goal—\"aiming at the new moon\", to quote the gleeful opinion of \"Cuthy\", who had once more become offensively cocksure of his team\u0027s abilities. Precious time oozed away while spectators retrieved the ballooned ball, and all the while Dick\u0027s big toe hurt like toothache. A pretty kettle of fish all round. Dick had a temper, and came near to losing it publicly. Again the maddening voice of the village idiot began to boom at him. \"Owd can\u0027t sco?ar!\" it bellowed monotonously. It had the melancholy effect of a ship\u0027s steam-siren in a fog. It worried the sensitive captain more than his damaged toe did. \"This is aching misery,\" he mentally decided. \"Hang it all, I\u0027ll waste no more passes on Lake and Atack. Fifteen minutes to go, and not a ghost of a goal in sight. \u0027Owd can\u0027t sco?ar\u0027 or not, I\u0027ll butt right into the Octopus and chance it.\" From the moment of this resolve a mighty change was wrought in the game. Of combination there was none, but of vigorous individual action there was a great deal. Giving his damaged foot no quarter, using it as though it were sound, Dick dribbled for goal by the straightest route, clashing against Bessingham each time he did so. It became a battle of giants, almost too thrilling to those onlookers who favoured one team more than the other. Players on both sides, brought to a standstill by the gruelling pace, seemed to have slipped out of the picture, leaving the centre of the field to Dick and the Octopus, two gladiators at ever-closer grips. \"Stick to him, Forge!\" yelled Robin. \"He\u0027s cracking up! You\u0027ll be his \u0027daddy\u0027 yet!\" \"Old Bess lets nobody be his daddy,\" indignantly retorted Cuthy. \"Your captain\u0027s only a kid beside him.\" \"Kid yourself!\" snorted Robin. \"Just you watch Forge, Cuthy—there\u0027ll be a hole in the back of this net shortly.\" Lyon alone on the Foxenby side gave useful aid to his captain, and it was from two of the plodding fullback\u0027s returns that Dick twice dodged Bessingham and struck the cross-bar. Both shots went where the keeper was not—each, an inch lower, would have made a goal. Such rough luck notwithstanding, \"Owd can\u0027t sco?ar, owd can\u0027t sco?ar!\" bawled Fluffy Jim, derisively waving his papered arms. \"Some sort of mascot, this,\" thought the bitterly-disappointed captain, \"and to make sure I shan\u0027t miss seeing him, they flatten him against the ropes. Fun for them—rotten for me!\" Time travelled apace. The referee looked at his watch—a plain hint that the end was nigh. Nothing seemed likelier than the match fizzling out in a goalless draw—a depressing result, satisfactory to neither side. Yet there was one among the spectators whose youthful heart declined to be downcast. One also whose lungs were sound as a bell, and whose throat was still capable of leading the way in a fresh chorus of rousing yells. Robin Arkness was the undaunted enthusiast who started the swelling cheer which infected the neutral spectators and struck a warm, reviving glow to Dick Forge\u0027s heart. \"Well played, Forge—played the captain of the Foxes!\" yelled the Juniors, in uplifting chorus. \"Three cheers for the good old captain—hip, hip, hooray!\" Ah, what priceless encouragement was this, at a moment when all seemed lost! To Dick it seemed to bring new life, fresh strength. He could feel his pulses leaping again as the ball came his way once more. Broome, too, felt the spur of that timely cheer, shook off his ill-humour, and sprinted to the captain\u0027s side. \"Hang on, Forge!\" he said. \"Go ahead! Don\u0027t bother passing just yet.\" Bessingham, cool and confident as ever, bore down upon the pair, feeling for the ball with feet that never erred. Clever, uncanny Bessingham! Just how he did it, you couldn\u0027t tell, but he nipped the leather right from Dick\u0027s toe, and down went the mercury behind the goal, changing the Cub-foxes\u0027 cheer to a groan. \"Oh, jumping crackers!\" cried Robin. \"Forge has lost it!\" \"Didn\u0027t I tell you?\" shrieked the delighted Cuthy. \"The chap isn\u0027t born that can run round old Bess.\" But this time it was not to be altogether a one-man show. Broome did not fail his captain. The funk, which had weakened his knees before, passed suddenly away from him. Brain-concussion was the risk he lightly took as he jumped up to Bessingham\u0027s mighty kick and headed the ball down again. Jove, how it hurt him! For a moment it knocked him silly, but he recovered himself sufficiently to dribble a few yards and pass the ball to Dick. Oh, glorious moment, sweet to have come to see! At last, at last, the Octopus was beaten—stranded in utter helplessness. His long legs, stride they never so widely, could not overtake the flying Foxonian now. His colleagues had trusted implicitly to him to clear; only one of them could get near enough to Forge to thrust out a hacking foot, over which Dick nimbly jumped. It was then a clear man-to-man encounter between centre-forward and goalkeeper, with all the rest of the players as idle spectators. For the first time, in eighty-eight minutes of strenuous football, the Octopus betrayed emotion and spoke. \"Come out to meet him, goalie!\" he cried, in desperation. Out came \"goalie\" at the word of command, and round him, with the ease of a dancing-master, waltzed Dick. Tears of real joy stung Dick\u0027s eyelids, for there in front of him yawned the empty goal that nobody could miss. To make assurance doubly sure, he would not even risk a gentle kick, but would, he told himself, walk the ball into the net. Oh, surely the Cup was Foxenby\u0027s now! And then, right across his path, almost beneath the cross-bar, there came blundering an absurdly clumsy figure in blue-and-white paper trappings—the grotesque form of Fluffy Jim, the village idiot, who lunged at the ball with a hobnailed boot and kicked it into the net under the very eyes of the horrified captain. \"Theer!\" cried Fluffy Jim, with a shriek of imbecile laughter. \"Tha couldn\u0027t sco?ar thesen, so Ah\u0027ve sco?ared for thee!\" Poor Forge! Unlucky captain of the luckless Foxes! What miserable turn of events was this? Why had so farcical a thing come to mock him on the very verge of his triumph? A wild absurdity, yet an unspeakable misfortune! It made him feel dazed and stupid. There was a queer vagueness in the impression he got of an excited crowd of spectators and players falling upon Fluffy Jim and tearing to tatters his blue-and-white costume. He felt himself pulled hither and thither by roughly-sympathizing hands, and with difficulty wrenched himself free. Then up strode the Octopus, genuinely distressed and grimly resolute. \"Forge,\" said the Octopus, \"the goal was yours and the game is yours. You will take the Cup.\" \"I can\u0027t,\" said Dick despairingly. \"I didn\u0027t score.\" Bessingham turned abruptly to the referee. \"Sir,\" he said, \"that was Forge\u0027s goal—this is Foxenby\u0027s game. Give them the verdict.\" The referee was a big man, nearing middle age, who had ruled exciting games before Bessingham was born. He knew the laws of football from A to Z—had, indeed, helped to make not a few of them. And pleading with him to alter those rules, even by a hairsbreadth, was merely a way of wasting breath. \"Impossible,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorrier than I can say, but Regulation 17 definitely rules that, if all or any portion of the crowd encroaches on the ground during the game, the tie shall be replayed in its entirety. The spectator broke in—that washes out the match.\" \"No, no, I beg of you,\" the Octopus pleaded. \"Restart the game here and now, and I\u0027ll see that all comes right. Foxenby\u0027s won, sir—be a sport!\" \"I\u0027m a referee first—a sport afterwards,\" said the whistle-blower, sharply. \"Time!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2760/76160.html","bookId":1342,"book":{"id":1342,"title":"Forge of Foxenby","description":"简介： But, until the ball is seen resting in the back of the net, it is as unwise to count a goal as it is to reckon chickens still in the shell.
