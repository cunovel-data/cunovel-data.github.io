{"id":13509,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX Luke Harwood in the Picture","content":"British weather is notorious for its very quick changes. Thus, the day after the fruitless burglar hunt, the Captain of Foxenby was sitting in warm sunshine on the verge of the Shrubbery when the Prefect of Holbeck\u0027s House strolled across to condole with him. \"At the risk of seeming to rub it in, Forge, I want to tender my sincere sympathy,\" said Harwood, sitting beside him. \"In your shoes I\u0027d be puzzled what to do.\" \"Thanks—yes. I\u0027m pretty well bunkered, Harwood. Unconsciously, by your kindness in collecting all those subs., you did us a bad turn; they all went.\" \"And by now, doubtless, have been spent on a fuddle in the Thieves\u0027 Kitchen,\" Harwood agreed. \"More of my mistaken zeal coming back on me! The money\u0027s gone—Kismet! No subscriptions, no paper!\" The captain turned sharply round to stare at the Prefect. \"What do you mean, Harwood? \u0027No paper!\u0027 Are you thinking, then, that there\u0027ll be no Rooke\u0027s House Rag after this?\" Luke gave his pleasant laugh. \"Well, it\u0027s rather a natural inference, Forge. Paper costs money. Printing-ink ditto. If the money\u0027s in the Thieves\u0027 Kitchen it can\u0027t be spent here. Ergo, you are justified in ceasing publication.\" He felt annoyed during this speech to find himself getting somewhat red in the face beneath the questioning scrutiny of Dick\u0027s clear eyes. There was something about what he had said which evidently did not appeal to the Captain. \"I say, Harwood, please don\u0027t suggest a get-out that I\u0027m sure you wouldn\u0027t adopt yourself! Take the Foxes\u0027 money and give them nothing in return! Impossible!\" \"But you didn\u0027t take the brass—the burglars pinched it. Don\u0027t be too straitlaced, Forge, for your own sake. Men of business \u0027wind up\u0027 when their funds are stolen, and nobody blames them. It\u0027s simply Fate!\" \"Oh, thanks for the tip, Harwood! Perhaps I am over-squeamish, but I took a quarter\u0027s subscription from Foxenby in exchange for a fortnightly mag., and I mean, by hook or by crook, to deliver the goods.\" Harwood jumped up and shot out his hand impulsively. There seemed to be a troublesome lump in his throat as he spoke. \"Bravo, old fellow! You\u0027re top-hole. Keep the flag flying by all means, and if there\u0027s anything I can do to help; any—er—little loan——\" \"Oh, by Jove, no thanks, Harwood! Awfully decent of you, but this is entirely my own show.\" Contrary to his custom, Harwood did not efface himself this time. He resumed his seat beside Dick and talked in quiet tones of other things, apparently oblivious of a growing disturbance in the shrubbery behind him—a row which closely concerned him, too, because the Juniors of his House were foremost in making it. It was not now the old squabble between Merry Men and Squirms, to which the Prefects, by common consent, turned a deaf ear. On this occasion the Squirms had it all to themselves. They were \"ragging\" somebody, and the shrieks of their victim were agonized enough to suggest a lynching. \"Are your youngsters killing a pig this morning, Harwood?\" the Captain inquired, uneasily. \"Rather more din than usual, what? Shouldn\u0027t like the Old Man to hear it in his present raw state.\" Harwood looked languidly round at the heaving mass in the shrubbery. \"It\u0027ll die down,\" he said. \"Like Bo-peep\u0027s lost sheep, they\u0027re better left alone. Let me see, what was I saying? Oh, about that Cup re-play, old man——\" He got no further, for at that moment the dishevelled victim of the Squirms\u0027 horseplay burst from the shrubbery and fastened his dirty hands frantically on the Prefect\u0027s knees. \"Oh, Harwood, please, they\u0027re murdering me—murdering me, I say. Send them back—take their sticks from them. I\u0027m beaten black and blue!\" The boy\u0027s fat, unwholesome cheeks shook like those of an overfed man. His small eyes protruded with fear. Though bearing no visible sign of ill-usage, he looked the picture of abject terror. \"Get up, Mawdster—take your filthy paws off my breeks!\" Harwood commanded, in disgust. \"But—but aren\u0027t you going to do anything for me, Harwood?\" \"Yes—I\u0027m going to cane some of the dirt off your hands if you aren\u0027t inside Holbeck\u0027s within half a minute,\" said Harwood, inexorably. This was an order which few Juniors would have dared to disobey, but the trembling boy, after a nervous glance back at the Squirms (discreetly silent now), stretched out an imploring hand to the Captain. \"Oh, please, Forge, won\u0027t you protect me?\" he whined. \"Harwood never will. He doesn\u0027t care if they kill me!\" Here, indeed, was rank rebellion—open defiance of a prefect, and insult heaped upon it. For the second time, Peter Mawdster had committed the gross offence of appealing to the Captain of the School over the head of his own prefect. Dick said nothing at all. With a nod to Harwood, he rose to go. \"Hop into my study at once, Mawdster,\" said Harwood furiously. \"As you\u0027re determined to seek trouble, you shall have it—six on each hand.\" This incident—trivial perhaps in itself—left an unpleasant impression on Dick\u0027s mind. That a cheeky youngster from another House should twice have tried to secure his protection was irritating enough, but Harwood\u0027s method of handling the shrubbery trouble did not strike him as possessing the wisdom of Solomon. Whatever Mawdster had done to deserve his unpopularity, in bullying him so badly the Squirms had earned punishment. Yet the Prefect of Holbeck\u0027s House, without inquiry, caned the victim and let the tormentors go free! \"Is that bias or just an error of judgment?\" Dick asked of Roger, to whom he confided the details of the occasion. \"I\u0027d better not voice an opinion, Dick! Where Luke Harwood is concerned, possibly I\u0027m one-eyed, too!\" \"But wouldn\u0027t you, in my place, have interfered?\" \"Emphatically, no. If anybody in Holbeck\u0027s House has a grievance against its prefect, he can report it to Mr. Holbeck. There is a further Court of Appeal—to the Headmaster himself.\" \"Well put, Roger, K.C.! You have freed my mind. I want nothing more on it than is already there, I can assure you.\" He was about to tell Roger what Harwood had said about ceasing the publication of the Rag, but a second thought stopped his tongue. He did not himself question the sincerity of Harwood\u0027s suggestion, but he felt instinctively that Roger would. He feared that Roger, always prejudiced against The Foxonian\u0027s editor, would say that the wish was father to the thought—that the early death of The Rooke\u0027s House Rag, leaving The Foxonian once more alone in the field, would just suit Harwood\u0027s book. So he changed the subject for another. \"I\u0027ve got my exeat, Roger, and shall cycle to Moston to see the Fairtype Press manager this afternoon.\" \"Good luck!\" said Roger. \"Hope he\u0027ll be decent about it.\" Head scholar of Rooke\u0027s House though he was, neck-and-neck rival of Luke Harwood in the race for the Christmas prizes, Roger made mistakes that afternoon which caused amused astonishment in class. Work could not hold him. His thoughts were elsewhere. Heart and mind he was with Dick Forge in the Moston printing-office, wherein much that affected their reputation at Foxenby was in the balance to-day. What if that fair-spoken printing manager declined to wait for his money, or, worse still, refused to print off another number of the Rag? Luke Harwood had already announced a \"special term-end number\" of The Foxonian—how humiliating it would be if no Rag appeared as a counter-blast to it! Yet, if such a downfall threatened them, Roger was powerless to avert it. His people were in poor circumstances; only by dint of winning scholarships could Roger keep himself at Foxenby. The small burden of his scanty savings had been lifted from him by the burglars, and Dick had been relieved of far more. No wonder Roger had no appetite for tea that night! His eyes were pools of troubled light as he raised them to greet Dick on the latter\u0027s return. \"Come, dear old fiddle-face, cheer up!\" laughed Dick. \"All\u0027s well!\" \"Dick, I can see the good news oozing out of you. Bravo—you\u0027ve worked the oracle!\" \"Easily!\" said Dick. \"That printer\u0027s heart must be all aswim with the milk of human kindness. It seems he\u0027d read about the burglary in the newspaper, which was obviously hard up for \u0027copy\u0027, because it mentioned us by name as co-editors of the Rag, and made far more sympathetic fuss over our loss than it did over the Head\u0027s. Well, Mr. Printer put out his hand, said how sorry he was and all that, and told me to lose no sleep—he\u0027d do his bit in the publication department if I cared to carry on.\" \"Why, what a brick! Who\u0027d have thought it from the looks of him? At first I considered him rather soapily insincere.\" \"You\u0027re a funny old ox, Roger—always suspicious of everybody!\" \"Except of you, old sport,\" Roger replied. \"Didn\u0027t he want a guarantee of some sort?\" \"None whatever. Accepted without demur my promise to pay up in full next term. Made me blush half-way down my back by saying he could see I was the soul of honour. And I can manage it quite O.K. by the exercise of strict economy. It means mortgaging a year\u0027s allowance at least, and docking every kind of luxury, but who cares for that if the dear old Rag goes on?\" \"Nobody—three cheers!\" cried Roger. \"Out with the ink and paper, you jolly old editor chap! I\u0027m going to present your next number with a burlesque of the burglary, just to show the school how lightly we carry misfortune!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2760/76167.html","bookId":1342,"book":{"id":1342,"title":"Forge of Foxenby","description":"简介： But, until the ball is seen resting in the back of the net, it is as unwise to count a goal as it is to reckon chickens still in the shell.
