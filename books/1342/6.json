{"id":13506,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI The Plea of Peter Mawdster","content":"The complete failure of the first number of their Rooke\u0027s House Rag gave Dick and Roger rather a wretched night. But with the morning-time there came a ray of hope. Luke Harwood brought in a whole sheaf of subscriptions which he had voluntarily collected from Holbeck\u0027s House. There was a fine spirit of sportsmanship about his unsought assistance, which almost betrayed the grateful Captain into a display of emotion. O\u0027er Roger Cayton\u0027s head it heaped coals of fire indeed! \"\u0027Pon my word, Harwood, you\u0027re real jannock,\" Dick managed to stammer. \"What hours you must have spent on this collecting stunt! It—it\u0027s downright brickish of you.\" \"Oh, cut that out,\" said Harwood, with a laugh. \"To be honest, it was a jolly good excuse for dodging \u0027prep.\u0027. I didn\u0027t feel like swotting last night.\" \"But I say, you know, you shame me. I never thought of doing anything like this for you, Harwood!\" \"The cases don\u0027t run on all fours, old man. I took over The Foxonian as a going concern. Generations of Foxonians had edited it before me. It was almost as old and venerable as Nelson\u0027s monument. You had competition to face—your Rag was an infant in arms. I love rivalry—it stimulates me. Let nothing discourage you, old boy—keep right on making each number better than the last.\" He faded away with his customary grace, leaving behind him a completely captivated Dick and a non-plussed and sour-visaged Roger. \"How now, Stormy Petrel!\" cried Dick. \"It\u0027s amusing to what extremes you carry your prejudice against Luke Harwood, Roger. Bears you no malice whatever for the hard knocks you gave him in your \u0027Sauce for the Gander\u0027 column. Now, Roger, knuckle under, old man! He\u0027s our Good Samaritan.\" \"Who appointed him our collector, anyway?\" said Roger. \"Sly impertinence, I call it. Well,\" he added, relenting at sight of Dick\u0027s crestfallen face, \"perhaps I am rather a graceless churl to-night. I\u0027ll put this bagful of money safely away in the locker, and then start raking the subscriptions in myself before some other voluntary helper queers my pitch!\" Harwood\u0027s \"sly impertinence\" had gingered Roger up, at any rate. By nightfall he had wheedled \"subs\" out of the majority of Rooke\u0027s House, and when they visited Moston with \"copy\" for the second number of the Rag, they carried with them funds ample enough to defray the cost of publication for months ahead. \"Gentlemen, do you mind holdin\u0027 over the matter of payment a week or two?\" said the Manager of the Moston Fairtype Press, almost plaintively. \"I\u0027m just now neck-deep in arrears of work—never a spare moment for book-keepin\u0027 do I get.\" \"Oh, but we\u0027d rather pay, really, and get it off our minds,\" said Dick. \"Then we shall know exactly where we stand,\" Roger supplemented. The manager spread out his ink-stained hands imploringly. \"It\u0027s all right, Mr. Forge—carry on, Mr. Cayton. I know you both—we can trust one another. I\u0027ll make out a bill to-morrow and you can pay me next time you\u0027re in town. I\u0027d much rather!\" So the co-editors went away again with the money in their pockets, excusably touched by this further proof of confidence in their honesty. Number two of the Rag came out in all its glory, irreproachably printed on fine-quality paper, and so far they hadn\u0027t been permitted to pay a farthing towards its cost! It seemed almost like philanthropy. It was gratifying, too, to see how much better the second issue went down than the first had done. Probably because they had paid for it this time, the boys did not chuck it about, and it appeared to be read with even closer attention than was the monthly Foxonian, brought out simultaneously. In truth, the rival papers lashed out at each other, though with perfect fairness, and the contents of both were voted \"particularly spicy\". \"Roger, old man, shake!\" cried Dick, after tea. \"This is my life\u0027s happiest day, I really think. Thanks, as much as anything, to your pungent \u0027Sauce for the Gander\u0027, we are in this pleasant position—— Now, kid, why are you nosing about here? Clear off!\" He broke into his congratulatory speech to turn irritably on a flabby-faced, unhealthily fat youngster, who had had the amazing cheek to draw his attention by plucking at his sleeve. \"Oh, please, Forge, I\u0027d rather not go until I\u0027ve spoken to you privately,\" the Junior said. \"Privately! Well, of all the nerve! You can say anything you\u0027ve got to say in front of my friend here, and look slippery, too. Doubt if I ought to let you speak at all—butting into our conversation like that.\" \"Sorry, Forge, but I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll mind when I\u0027ve told you everything. I\u0027ve come to you for protection.\" \"Protection! From me? I\u0027m honoured—overwhelmed! Take a square look at this young genius, Roger. Is he quite \u0027all there\u0027, do you consider?\" \"Nothing balmy about me, Forge,\" said the youngster, with self-possession. \"I merely called to lay a complaint——\" \"Well, don\u0027t lay it as heavily as a foundation-stone,\" interrupted Dick. \"That\u0027ll do for the first part of your speech, youngster. Hurry up with the second. I\u0027ll give you a couple of minutes.\" He took out his watch. \"I\u0027m Mawdster, from Holbeck\u0027s House—the boy who stuck up for the Rooke\u0027s House Rag when all my chums were slating it.\" \"Ah, to be sure!\" said Roger. \"One of the Squirms, and looks it, too.\" The Junior gave Roger a quick glance which seemed to say, \"It\u0027s none of your business, anyhow.\" Then he made his moan. \"Ever since that day, Forge, I\u0027ve caught it hot from both sides—my own and Robin Hood\u0027s. And all because I said your mag. was better got-up than The Foxonian.\" Dick and Roger exchanged half-amused glances. Then Dick looked back at his watch. \"One minute,\" he chuckled. \"Any more of this, kid?\" \"A lot, Forge! They blackguard me all the time—I\u0027ve a dog\u0027s life between the two gangs—and yesterday they held my head down ever so long in the fountain.\" \"Did you report that to your prefect?\" \"Yes—to Harwood. But he only laughed and said it would save me the trouble of washing myself—or some such rot. I know why he did nothing—because he\u0027d heard I\u0027d been running The Foxonian down and praising your Rag, Forge. He\u0027ll always have his knife into me for that.\" \"Oh, rather!\" said the Captain, ironically. \"Quite a natural assumption that Harwood will lie awake o\u0027 nights wondering how to get even with you. Don\u0027t be an idiot, young Mudster.\" \"Mawdster, if you please, Forge,\" the Junior corrected, not too respectfully. \"Mawdster, then! Don\u0027t snap! I think I understand you now. You belong to Holbeck\u0027s House, whose prefect snubs you. Then, because you once praised my magazine, you expect me to slip across and break a stick over the backs of a score of youngsters who are ragging you. If there\u0027s a more brazen little bounder in the whole of Foxenby, I\u0027ve yet to hear of him. Quit!\" \"But please, Forge——\" \"Quit, you little ass!\" put in Roger. \"Don\u0027t you know how hard the Captain can kick?\" The flabby youth, realizing that his audacious appeal had failed, got quickly out of the range of Dick\u0027s boot. But he paused long enough to get in a parting shot—a stinger, too. \"After all,\" he said, \"it\u0027s putrid to be bullied for praising the contents of a magazine, when all you really fancied was the paper and print!\" Both laughed ruefully at this when Mawdster had vanished. \"That\u0027s a backhander for us, straight between the eyes,\" said Roger. \"Rather!\" Dick agreed. \"The oily maggot! I only wish I\u0027d taken your tip, Roger, and driven my uninjured foot into his fat carcase!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2760/76164.html","bookId":1342,"book":{"id":1342,"title":"Forge of Foxenby","description":"简介： But, until the ball is seen resting in the back of the net, it is as unwise to count a goal as it is to reckon chickens still in the shell.
