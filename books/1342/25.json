{"id":13525,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV The Three-cornered Tournament","content":"Never had the Squirms, as a body, succeeded in scoring points over the Merry Men. Duffers at football and cricket, which they only played because both were compulsory, slackers in the gymnasium, and too flabby to shine in athletic sports, their chief recreations were indoor ones which did not fret their fat, such as chess, draughts, and dominoes. At these three games they frequently played to pass away the long winter evenings, while other boys indulged in gymnastics and boxing. Consequently, quite a number of them became, through constant practice, fairly proficient in table games—certainly far cleverer at them than other Foxes of their own age, who seldom cared to play with them. \"I\u0027ve got a rattling good idea for taking the starch out of Robin and his gang,\" Osbody announced to a little group of Squirms. \"Their beastly heads are swollen to the size of balloons over the flukey way they nabbed the burglars. Odious to see them swanking about, isn\u0027t it, chaps?\" \"Makes me sick,\" agreed Grain. \"Positively nauseating to hear Old Man Wykeham puffing \u0027em up sky-high,\" said Niblo. \"Special holiday in their honour, indeed!\" \"I vote we all stick in the class-room and swot that day, just to show our contempt for it,\" suggested Vinns, a boy with a rather uncanny gift for mathematics—the only Squirm who had ever distinguished himself in a scholastic way. \"Swot yourself, Professor Vinns,\" snorted Grain. \"I\u0027d swop all my school-books for a penny bag of popcorn. Time to wonder how to spend the holiday when it comes. Just now, I\u0027m waiting to hear \u0027Body\u0027s plan for wiping Arkness\u0027s eye.\" \"It\u0027s this,\" said Osbody. \"Half the Merry Men (as they have the cheek to call themselves) scarcely know one end of a chess-board from another. Dominoes are just slabs of wood to them. Draughts make them shiver.\" \"Granting all that,\" said Niblo, \"I don\u0027t see what you\u0027re driving at.\" \"Well, we all want to take Robin\u0027s conceited \u0027crush\u0027 down a peg, I guess?\" \"Rather! Aching for the chance.\" \"Then it\u0027s yours for the asking. Not to make a song of it, I\u0027ve written something on a sheet of paper which, if you\u0027re all agreeable, I shall send to Arkness to-night. Listen, and I\u0027ll read it.\" He smoothed out a sheet of foolscap, cleared his throat, and began: \"We, the Foxenby Junior Games Club, hereby challenge Robin Hood and his Merry Men to a three-cornered tournament, viz: Games of Chess, Draughts, and Dominoes, to be played in the Holbeck House Games-room on Friday evening next.\" \"Oh, great gingerbreads, that\u0027s ripping!\" said Niblo. \"Best idea ever!\" said Vinns. \"Humph!\" grunted Grain. \"Must be grass-green, both of you, if you fancy they\u0027ll rise to a bait like that.\" Osbody looked annoyed. Grain\u0027s habit of throwing cold water on everything he suggested was always a thorn in the flesh of the leader of the Squirms. \"See nothing to sneer about, Grain,\" he snapped. \"Why shouldn\u0027t they bite?\" \"They\u0027ll make paper pellets of the challenge,\" Grain persisted. \"What asses they would be to play us on our own pitch, so to speak, at games they don\u0027t stand an earthly in. Fancy Arkness bringing his men like lambs to the slaughter! He\u0027s too fly for that!\" \"I agree,\" said Niblo, with a sigh of disappointment. \"It won\u0027t come off, \u0027Body, old man. Better make paper boats of the challenge than give Robin the chance to be sarcastic about it.\" \"Yes,\" said Vinns. \"He\u0027s confoundedly clever at writing skits.\" But Osbody stubbornly declined to be talked out of his venture. \"Stow your jaw, everybody,\" he said. \"This challenge is going, whatever you say. I\u0027m positive it\u0027s the only way of taking a rise out of Arkness and his Shrubbery hooligans.\" \"It\u0027ll come back like a boomerang,\" growled Grain. \"Well, if it does, only my head will suffer, for I shall sign it,\" said Osbody. \"Here, younker,\" he broke off, collaring a First-form boy who was trying to slip past, \"take this paper to Robin Arkness, in Rooke\u0027s House. Look alive, now.\" Five minutes later Robin was reading out the challenge to a group of Merry Men in the \"gym\". Its arrival quite knocked the steam out of a ding-dong glove-fight between Little John and Friar Tuck, old rivals in pugilism. They ceased banging each other and gathered round Robin with the rest. \"What a beastly lot of one-eyed badgers,\" exclaimed David of Doncaster. \"Rather!\" agreed Will Scarlet. \"Licked at everything that matters, they want to draw us into chimney-corner and parish-tea games.\" \"No jolly fear,\" said Little John. \"Chess always gives me a headache.\" \"Same here,\" said the Miller. \"I always end by building castles with my dominoes,\" said the Tinker. \"Draughts strikes me as a sort of girl\u0027s game,\" another Merry Man put in. \"Allan a Dale\u0027s the only man we have who can play all three games decently,\" the Tanner declared. \"Good idea,\" said Dave. \"Set Allan on playing Osbody, and we\u0027ll all stand round to watch.\" Shy Allan hastily declined the honour, whereupon Robin, having waited for the hubbub to subside, gave his opinion. \"Cheek in chunks, but artful—particularly artful,\" he said. \"We don\u0027t want to play the Squirms at games. We don\u0027t want to sit in the same room with them. We\u0027d rather play snakes-and-ladders with the Tinker\u0027s flamingoes at the Zoo.\" \"We would indeed!\" cried Will Scarlet. \"Send him a snorting answer, Robin.\" \"Refuse the challenge, do you mean?\" queried Robin. \"I should say so, thumbs down.\" Robin shook his head sadly. \"We can\u0027t,\" he groaned. \"If we did, they\u0027d never afterwards cease yapping at us. Oh, yes, I can see you staring at me, but what would you say, chaps, if Osbody put up his dukes to me in the Shrubbery and sang out \u0027Come on\u0027?\" \"We\u0027d tell you to go for him, Robin, like old steam.\" \"Just so. It would be a challenge, and you\u0027d expect me to take it. If he said, \u0027I\u0027ll race you up the Moston Church-side to the steeple\u0027, daft though that would be, I\u0027d have to climb with him. Twig what I mean, boys? The Merry Men\u0027s reputation is at stake. We cannot refuse.\" Many of them decidedly differed from this opinion. Why, they argued, should they give the Squirms the chance of scalping them in a tournament of Osbody\u0027s own choosing? But Robin was not to be shaken. \"I\u0027ll put that right, chaps,\" he said. \"Give me two minutes while I answer the challenge.\" He scribbled furiously for a time and then read out the following: \"We, the Merry Men, accept the challenge of the Foxenby Junior Games Club to play them at Chess, Draughts, and Dominoes on Friday evening next IF they will agree to play us at football on the following Wednesday afternoon. \"(Signed) Robin Hood.\" \"Good!\" exclaimed David of Doncaster. \"That\u0027s a facer for them, Robin.\" \"You\u0027ve turned their flanks,\" commented Will Scarlet. \"The mere thought of meeting us at footer will make them goggle-eyed.\" \"It\u0027ll wash out the Games Tournament, hurrah!\" cried Little John, intensely relieved. \"Don\u0027t be too cocksure of that, fellows,\" said Robin, gloomily. \"I hope it will, but we\u0027ve got to be ready for anything.\" He found a messenger to carry the answer to Osbody, whose face lengthened somewhat as he read it aloud to his cronies. \"There, you\u0027ve let us in for it now!\" cried Grain, angrily. \"Didn\u0027t I warn you the boomerang would come back? Fancy having to play \u0027em at football! The bare idea gives me a stitch in my side.\" It was a turning of the tables which the Squirms had not even remotely anticipated, and they followed Grain\u0027s lead in heaping reproaches on Osbody\u0027s head. But he, too, had a will of his own, combined with a gift of leadership almost equal to that of Robin. \"Chaps,\" he said, \"have I ever failed you as a leader of this band? We have had some pretty rough times—when did I ever show funk?\" They were compelled to admit that he had stood by them through thick and thin. \"Very well, then,\" said Osbody. \"Either I\u0027m to have the pleasure of leading you to victory once in a while, or the whole bag-o\u0027-tricks goes overboard. Football or no football afterwards, we\u0027re playing this games\u0027 tournament on Friday evening.\" Grain\u0027s crafty eyes lit up with sudden hope. \"Nobody\u0027s indispensable,\" he said, significantly. Osbody shot a fiery glance at his rival. \"Let the fellows choose!\" he snapped. \"I\u0027ll have my way, or go.\" If Grain had any serious hopes of stepping into Osbody\u0027s shoes at that moment, his disappointment must have been intense. Fully twenty of the Squirms were present, and they crowded round Osbody with assurances of loyalty that did them credit. \"You\u0027re right, \u0027Body,\" said \"Professor\" Vinns. \"Revenge is sweet, and for once we\u0027ll have it.\" \"So we will,\" said Niblo. \"At chess, draughts, and dominoes we\u0027ll make crawling worms of them. They shall taste the dust beneath our feet.\" \"Just as we shall taste the mud beneath their boots when the football match comes off,\" sneered Grain, savagely. \"Rats to the old football match!\" said Niblo. \"If necessary, we will play two goalkeepers to hold the score down. Friday comes before Wednesday, and thrice-armed is he who gets his blow in first.\" In the few remaining days before the tournament some of the Merry Men tried desperately hard to rub up their knowledge of indoor games. Allan a Dale, bashful and slow-spoken as a rule, became almost as loud-voiced as a drill-sergeant in his efforts to teach chess and draughts to his chums. Lovers of the open-air as they were, their thoughts were continually wandering from the chequered board. Robin alone made satisfactory progress. It was up to him, he believed, to set his men a good example, though all his eloquence failed to keep Little John longer at the chess-board than fifteen minutes at a time. \"I shall just move the pieces anyhow and trust to luck,\" Little John said. \"Then your opponent will wipe the floor with you.\" \"If he does,\" said Little John, grimly, \"let him look out for himself when I meet him on the football-field, that\u0027s all.\" Generally speaking, it was this thought of out-door revenge which sustained the dejected Merry Men when they took their seats for the tournament on Friday evening. Osbody had arranged the order of things most craftily. First came dominoes, as the game in which there was only a slight element of skill. It was natural that the Merry Men would score a few points at dominoes, though three-fourths of them were well-beaten, Robin and Allan being amongst the losers. The Squirms were openly exultant. Even Osbody had difficulty in repressing a triumphant smile. \"Draughts next,\" announced the leader of the Squirms. \"Any particular fancy about pairing off, Arkness?\" \"I\u0027ll play you,\" said Robin. \"The other fellows can sort themselves out as they like.\" Osbody whispered something to Vinns, who casually dropped into a chair opposite Allan a Dale. This was a pre-arranged plan, for \"Professor\" Vinns was as weirdly clever at board-games as he was at mathematics, and all Allan a Dale\u0027s skill proved powerless to prevent him winning. Their game lasted longest, but the result was never in doubt. Allan, the hope of the Merry Men, was cornered and beaten. No sum of subtraction was needed to reckon the tally in favour of the Squirms. They had won every game but two drawn ones, Osbody having failed to beat Robin, and Grain having found in Will Scarlet an opponent too tough to knock out. \"Something like an evening\u0027s sport,\" commented Osbody. \"Most enjoyable,\" murmured Niblo. These happy meetings ought to become a permanent feature,\" said \"Professor\" Vinns, beaming over his glasses at his crestfallen opponent. \"I beg to differ,\" said Robin. \"Not in an atmosphere like this, anyhow. Phew! I can scarcely breathe! I vote we have all the windows open, chaps; the place is like a furnace.\" Some of the Merry Men ran at once to the window-cords, but Osbody violently protested. \"Windows open be hanged!\" he cried. \"It\u0027s freezing outside. There\u0027s a sea-breeze that cuts like a knife. We should all get our deaths of cold.\" \"Rubbish!\" retorted Robin. \"Fresh air never harmed anyone. Better to shiver than be baked alive. I feel like a bread-loaf in an oven.\" \"I can\u0027t help that,\" snapped Osbody. \"I hate to sit in a draught. What do you other fellows say?\" The Squirms unanimously agreed with their leader. It would, they said, be like courting almost certain death from influenza or pneumonia to open the windows on such a night. \"Well,\" said Robin, \"it comes to this: we want air and you want suffocation. What\u0027s the polite rule in these cases? The visiting team is given the choice. Are you for ventilation, my Merry Men?\" \"Ay, ay, Robin!\" the Merry Men cried, with one voice. \"Fresh-air fiends!\" snorted Grain. \"We shan\u0027t agree,\" said Osbody. \"Right you are,\" cried Robin easily. \"There\u0027s only one thing to do, then. We\u0027ll leave the tournament as it is, and call it a draw.\" The Squirms stared at one another in blank consternation. To be robbed of their sweeping victory in this freakish fashion was a misfortune not to be borne. \"Tommy-rot!\" exclaimed Osbody. \"We haven\u0027t played a single chess-game yet.\" \"Funkpots!\" sneered Grain. \"You\u0027re afraid to see it through.\" For answer Robin pulled down the upper part of a big window and his Merry Men followed his lead, flooding the over-heated room with sweet night air. \"There, that\u0027s better!\" cried Robin. \"Carry on with the chess.\" The Squirms were outmanoeuvred. They had either to abandon full and complete victory or finish the tournament in a torrent of air which swept their score-cards to the floor. So, with sinking hearts, and the sourest of faces, they turned up their coat-collars and decided to \"stick it\". At chess most of the Merry Men went down like ninepins, some of them having difficulty in distinguishing knights from bishops. Once again the Squirms swept the board. Allan a Dale and Robin, by dint of mental gymnastics which made their heads swim, wrung draws from Vinns and Osbody respectively; but these partial successes only threw the general rout of the Merry Men into stronger relief. Just as they had expected, they were decisively and ignominiously thrashed. Immediately the Squirms became a Mutual Admiration Society. Hands were wrung and shoulders were slapped, and in every way the Merry Men were made to feel that they were very small potatoes indeed. In unutterable disgust at such exceedingly bad taste, they trooped to the door. \"Here, aren\u0027t you going to give three cheers for the winners?\" Osbody called after them. With eyes that blazed contemptuously Robin flung round on him. \"No, we\u0027re not,\" he said. \"This wasn\u0027t a tournament from the start. It was like a rabbit-coursing match, where they blind and starve the rabbits before they let the dogs loose.\" \"Rubbish!\" Osbody scoffed. \"It was man to man. We met on even terms!\" \"All serene,\" answered Robin. \"Hope you\u0027ll think the same when we\u0027re dry-rubbing you next Wednesday!\" He hurried his Merry Men out of the room, and then, as a parting shot, popped his head round the door to shout— \"Hot water-bottles and babies\u0027 comforters, this way! All dirty Squirms with stiff necks should grease \u0027em with goose-fat. Like cures like!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2760/76183.html","bookId":1342,"book":{"id":1342,"title":"Forge of Foxenby","description":"简介： But, until the ball is seen resting in the back of the net, it is as unwise to count a goal as it is to reckon chickens still in the shell.
