{"id":24570,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 21 The Choices of Master Samwise","content":"Frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending over him, so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of Sam and his cries, until he was close at hand. As he rushed up he saw that Frodo was already bound in cords, wound about him from ankle to shoulder, and the monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his body away. On the near side of him lay, gleaming on the ground, his elven-blade, where it had fallen useless from his grasp. Sam did not wait to wonder what was to be done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage. He sprang forward with a yell, and seized his master\u0027s sword in his left hand. Then he charged. No onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world of beasts; where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth alone, will spring upon a tower of horn and hide that stands above its fallen mate. Disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless years, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw. Sam sprang in, inside the arches of her legs, and with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head. One great eye went dark. Now the miserable creature was right under her, for the moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claws. Her vast belly was above him with its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down. Still his fury held for one more blow, and before she could sink upon him, smothering him and all his little impudence of courage, he slashed the bright elven-blade across her with desperate strength. But Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her eyes. Knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide, but ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth. The blade scored it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of men, not though Elf or Dwarf should forge the steel or the hand of Beren or of T畆in wield it. She yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up the great bag of her belly high above Sam\u0027s head. Poison frothed and bubbled from the wound. Now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again. Too soon. For Sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping his own sword, with both hands he held the elven-blade point upwards, fending off that ghastly roof; and so Shelob, with the driving force of her own cruel will, with strength greater than any warrior\u0027s hand, thrust herself upon a bitter spike. Deep, deep it pricked, as Sam was crushed slowly to the ground. No such anguish had Shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in all her long world of wickedness. Not the doughtiest soldier of old Gondor, nor the most savage Orc entrapped, had ever thus endured her, or set blade to her beloved flesh. A shudder went through her. Heaving up again, wrenching away from the pain, she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap. Sam had fallen to his knees by Frodo\u0027s head, his senses reeling in the foul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword. Through the mist before his eyes he was aware dimly of Frodo\u0027s face and stubbornly he fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him. Slowly he raised his head and saw her, only a few paces away, eyeing him, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom, and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye. There she crouched, her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground, the great bows of her legs quivering, as she gathered herself for another spring-this time to crush and sting to death: no little bite of poison to still the struggling of her meat; this time to slay and then to rend. Even as Sam himself crouched, looking at her, seeing his death in her eyes, a thought came to him, as if some remote voice had spoken. and he fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he sought: cold and hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phantom world of horror, the Phial of Galadriel. \u0027Galadriel! \u0027 he said faintly, and then he heard voices far off but clear: the crying of the Elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved shadows of the Shire, and the music of the Elves as it came through his sleep in the Hall of Fire in the house of Elrond. Gilthoniel A Elbereth! And then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which he did not know: A Elbereth Gilthoniel o menel palan-diriel, le nallon sn di\u0027nguruthos! A tiro nin, Fanuilos! And with that he staggered to his feet and was Samwise the hobbit, Hamfast\u0027s son, again. \u0027Now come, you filth!\u0027 he cried. \u0027You\u0027ve hurt my master, you brute, and you\u0027ll pay for it. We\u0027re going on; but we\u0027ll settle with you first. Come on, and taste it again!\u0027 As if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion, the glass blazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand. It flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light. No such terror out of heaven had ever burned in Shelob\u0027s face before. The beams of it entered into her wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain, and the dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye. She fell back beating the air with her forelegs, her sight blasted by inner lightnings, her mind in agony. Then turning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and began to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind. Sam came on. He was reeling like a drunken man, but he came on. And Shelob cowed at last, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered as she tried to hasten from him. She reached the hole, and squeezing down, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as Sam hewed a last stroke at her dragging legs. Then he fell to the ground. Shelob was gone; and whether she lay long in her lair, nursing her malice and her misery, and in slow years of darkness healed herself from within, rebuilding her clustered eyes, until with hunger like death she spun once more her dreadful snares in the glens of the Mountains of Shadow, this tale does not tell. Sam was left alone. Wearily, as the evening of the Nameless Land fell upon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master. \u0027Master, dear master,\u0027 he said, but Frodo did not speak. As he had run forward, eager, rejoicing to be free, Shelob with hideous speed had come behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. He lay now pale, and heard no voice. and did not move. \u0027Master, dear master! \u0027 said Sam, and through a long silence waited. listening in vain. Then as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his head upon Frodo\u0027s breast and to his mouth, but no stir of life could he find, nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart. Often he chafed his master\u0027s hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all were cold. \u0027Frodo, Mr. Frodo! \u0027 he called. \u0027Don\u0027t leave me here alone! It\u0027s your Sam calling. Don\u0027t go where I can\u0027t follow! Wake up, Mr. Frodo! O wake up, Frodo, me dear, me dear. Wake up!\u0027 Then anger surged over hint, and he ran about his master\u0027s body in a rage, stabbing the air, and smiting the stones, and shouting challenges. Presently he came back, and bending looked at Frodo\u0027s face, pale beneath him in the dusk. And suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was revealed to him in the mirror of Galadriel in Lurien: Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Or fast asleep he had thought then. \u0027He\u0027s dead! \u0027 he said. \u0027Not asleep, dead! \u0027 And as he said it, as if the words had set the venom to its work again. it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green. And then black despair came down on him, and Sam bowed to the ground, and drew his grey hood over his head, and night came into his heart, and he knew no more. When at last the blackness passed, Sam looked up and shadows were about him; but for how many minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he could not tell. He was still in the same place, and still his master lay beside him dead. The mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into ruin. \u0027What shall I do, what shall I do? \u0027 he said. \u0027Did I come all this way with him for nothing? \u0027 And then he remembered his own voice speaking words that at the time he did not understand himself, at the beginning of their journey: I have something to do before the end. I must see it through, sir, if you understand. \u0027But what can I do? Not leave Mr. Frodo dead, unburied on the top of the mountains, and go home? Or go on? Go on?\u0027 he repeated, and for a moment doubt and fear shook him. \u0027Go on? Is that what I\u0027ve got to do? And leave him?\u0027 Then at last he began to weep; and going to Frodo he composed his body, and folded his cold hands upon his breast, and wrapped his cloak about him; and he laid his own sword at one side, and the staff that Faramir had given at the other. \u0027If I\u0027m to go on,\u0027 he said, \u0027then I must take your sword, by your leave, Mr. Frodo, but I\u0027ll put this one to lie by you, as it lay by the old king in the barrow; and you\u0027ve got your beautiful mithril coat from old Mr. Bilbo. And your star-glass, Mr. Frodo, you did lend it to me and I\u0027ll need it, for I\u0027ll be always in the dark now. It\u0027s too good for me, and the Lady gave it to you, but maybe she\u0027d understand. Do you understand, Mr. Frodo? I\u0027ve got to go on.\u0027 But he could not go, not yet. He knelt and held Frodo\u0027s hand and could not release it. And time went by and still he knelt, holding his master\u0027s hand, and in his heart keeping a debate. Now he tried to find strength to tear himself away and go on a lonely journey -- for vengeance. If once he could go, his anger would bear him down all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: Gollum. Then Gollum would die in a corner. But that was not what he had set out to do. It would not be worth while to leave his master for that. It would not bring him back. Nothing would. They had better both be dead together. And that too would be a lonely journey. He looked on the bright point of the sword. He thought of the places behind where there was a black brink and an empty fall into nothingness. There was no escape that way. That was to do nothing, not even to grieve. That was not what he had set out to do. \u0027What am I to do then? \u0027 he cried again, and now he seemed plainly to know the hard answer: see it through. Another lonely journey, and the worst. \u0027What? Me, alone, go to the Crack of Doom and all? \u0027 He quailed still, but the resolve grew. \u0027What? Me take the Ring from him? The Council gave it to him.\u0027 But the answer came at once: \u0027And the Council gave him companions, so that the errand should not fail. And you are the last of all the Company. The errand must not fail.\u0027 \u0027I wish I wasn\u0027t the last,\u0027 he groaned. \u0027I wish old Gandalf was hare or somebody. Why am I left all alone to make up my mind? I\u0027m sure to go wrong. And it\u0027s not for me to go taking the Ring, putting myself forward.\u0027 \u0027But you haven\u0027t put yourself forward; you\u0027ve been put forward. And as for not being the right and proper person, why, Mr. Frodo wasn\u0027t as you might say, nor Mr. Bilbo. They didn\u0027t choose themselves.\u0027 \u0027Ah well, I must make up my own mind. I will make it up. But I\u0027ll be sure to go wrong: that\u0027d be Sam Gamgee all over. \u0027Let me see now: if we\u0027re found here, or Mr. Frodo\u0027s found, and that Thing\u0027s on him, well, the Enemy will get it. And that\u0027s the end of all of us, of Lorien, and Rivendell, and the Shire and all. And there s no time to lose, or it\u0027ll be the end anyway. The war\u0027s begun, and more than likely things are all going the Enemy\u0027s way already. No chance to go back with It and get advice or permission. No, it\u0027s sit here till they come and kill me over master\u0027s body, and gets It: or take It and go.\u0027 He drew a deep breath. \u0027Then take It, it is! \u0027 He stooped. Very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his hand inside Frodo\u0027s tunic; then with his other hand raising the head, he kissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the chain over it. And then the head lay quietly back again in rest. No change came over the still face, and by that more than by all other tokens Sam was convinced at last that Frodo had died and laid aside the Quest. \u0027Good-bye, master, my dear! \u0027 he murmured. \u0027Forgive your Sam. He\u0027ll come back to this spot when the job\u0027s done -- if he manages it. And then he\u0027ll not leave you again. Rest you quiet till I come; and may no foul creature come anigh you! And if the Lady could hear me and give me one wish, I would wish to come back and find you again. Good-bye! \u0027 And then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it, and at once his head was bowed to the ground with the weight of the Ring, as if a great stone had been strung on him. But slowly, as if the weight became less, or new strength grew in him, he raised his head, and then with a great effort got to his feet and found that he could walk and bear his burden. And for a moment he lifted up the Phial and looked down at his master, and the light burned gently now with the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer, and in that light Frodo\u0027s face was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty, as of one who has long passed the shadows. And with the bitter comfort of that last sight Sam turned and hid the light and stumbled on into the growing dark. He had not far to go. The tunnel was some way behind; the Cleft a couple of hundred yards ahead, or less. The path was visible in the dusk\u0027 a deep rut worn in ages of passage, running now gently up in a long trough with cliffs on either side. The trough narrowed rapidly. Soon Sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps. Now the orc-tower was right above him, frowning black, and in it the red eye glowed. Now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it. He was coming to the top of the steps and was in the Cleft at last. \u0027I\u0027ve made up my mind,\u0027 he kept saying to himself. But he had not. Though he had done his best to think it out, what he was doing was altogether against the grain of his nature. \u0027Have I got it wrong? \u0027 he muttered. \u0027What ought I to have done? \u0027 As the sheer sides of the Cleft closed about him, before he reached the actual summit, before he looked at last on the path descending into the Nameless Land. he turned. For a moment, motionless in intolerable doubt, he looked back. He could still see, like a small blot in the gathering gloom, the mouth of the tunnel; and he thought he could see or guess where Frodo lay. He fancied there was a glimmer on the ground down there, or perhaps it was some trick of his tears, as he peered out at that high stony place where all his life had fallen in ruin. \u0027If only I could have my wish, my one wish,\u0027 he sighed, \u0027to go back and find him! \u0027 Then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few steps: the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken. Only a few steps; and now only a few more and he would be going down and would never see that high place again. And then suddenly he heard cries and voices. He stood still as stone. Orc-voices. They were behind him and before him. A noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts: Orcs were coming up to the Cleft from the far side, from some entry to the tower, perhaps. Tramping feet and shouts behind. He wheeled round. He saw small red lights, torches, winking away below there as they issued from the tunnel. At last the hunt was up. The red eye of the tower had not been blind. He was caught. Now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was very near. In a minute they would reach the top and be on him. He had taken too long in making up his mind, and now it was no good. How could he escape, or save himself, or save the Ring? The Ring. He was not aware of any thought or decision. He simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking the Ring in his hand. The head of the orc-company appeared in the Cleft right before him. Then he put it on. The world changed, and a single moment of time was filled with an hour of thought. At once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was dimmed, but otherwise than in Shelob\u0027s lair. All things about him now were not dark but vague; while he himself was there in a grey hazy world, alone, like a small black solid rock and the Ring, weighing down his left hand, was like an orb of hot gold. He did not feel invisible at all, but horribly and uniquely visible; and he knew that somewhere an Eye was searching for him. He heard the crack of stone, and the murmur of water far off in Morgul Vale; and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of Shelob, groping, lost in some blind passage; and voices in the dungeons of the tower; and the cries of the Orcs as they came out of the tunnel; and deafening, roaring in his ears, the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the Orcs before him. He shrank against the cliff. But they marched up like a phantom company, grey distorted figures in a mist, only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands. And they passed him by. He cowered, trying to creep away into some cranny and to hide. He listened. The Orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down had sighted one another, and both parties were now hurrying and shouting. He heard them both clearly, and he understood what they said. Perhaps the Ring gave understanding of tongues, or simply understanding, especially of the servants of Sauron its maker, so that if he gave heed, he understood and translated the thought to himself. Certainly the Ring had grown greatly in power as it approached the places of its forging; but one thing it did not confer, and that was courage. At present Sam still thought only of hiding, of lying low till all was quiet again; and he listened anxiously. He could not tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his ears. \u0027Hola! Gorbag! What are you doing up here? Had enough of war already? \u0027 \u0027Orders, you lubber. And what are you doing, Shagrat? Tired of lurking up there? Thinking of coming down to fight? \u0027 \u0027Orders to you. I\u0027m in command of this pass. So speak civil. What\u0027s your report? \u0027 \u0027Nothing.\u0027 \u0027Hai! hai! yoi!\u0027 A yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders. The Orcs lower down had suddenly seen something. They began to run. So did the others. \u0027Hai! Hola! Here\u0027s something! Lying right in the road. A spy, a spy! \u0027 There was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices. With a dreadful stroke Sam was wakened from his cowering mood. They had seen his master. What would they do? He had heard tales of the Orcs to make the blood run cold. It could not be borne. He sprang up. He flung the Quest and all his decisions away, and fear and doubt with them. He knew now where his place was and had been: at his master\u0027s side, though what he could do there was not clear. Back he ran down the steps, down the path towards Frodo. \u0027How many are there?\u0027 he thought. \u0027Thirty or forty from the tower at least, and a lot more than that from down below, I guess. How many can I kill before they get me? They\u0027ll see the flame of the sword, as soon as I draw it, and they\u0027ll get me sooner or later. I wonder if any song will ever mention it: How Samwise fell in the High Pass and made a wall of bodies round his master. No, no song. Of course not, for the Ring\u0027ll be found, and there\u0027ll be no more songs. I can\u0027t help it. My place is by Mr. Frodo. They must understand that -- Elrond and the Council, and the great Lords and Ladies with all their wisdom. Their plans have gone wrong. I can\u0027t be their Ring-bearer. Not without Mr. Frodo.\u0027 But the Orcs were out of his dim sight now. He had had no time to consider himself, but now he realized that he was weary, weary almost to exhaustion: his legs would not carry him as he wished. He was too slow. The path seemed miles long. Where had they all got to in the mist? There they were again! A good way ahead still. A cluster of figures round something lying on the ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and that, bent like dogs on a trail. He tried to make a spurt. \u0027Come on, Sam! \u0027 he said, \u0027or you\u0027ll be too late again.\u0027 He loosened the sword in its sheath. In a minute he would draw it, and then-- There was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted from the ground. \u0027Ya hoi! Ya harri hoi! Up! Up! \u0027 Then a voice shouted: \u0027Now off! The quick way. Back to the Undergate! She\u0027ll not trouble us tonight by all the signs.\u0027 The whole band of orc-figures began to move. Four in the middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders. \u0027Ya hoi! \u0027 They had taken Frodo\u0027s body. They were off. He could not catch them up. Still he laboured on. The Orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in. Those with the burden went first, and behind them there was a good deal of struggling and jostling. Sam came on. He drew the sword, a flicker of blue in his wavering hand, but they did not see it. Even as he came panting up, the last of them vanished into the black hole. For a moment he stood, gasping, clutching his breast. Then he drew his sleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears. \u0027Curse the filth! \u0027 he said, and sprang after them into the darkness. It no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if he had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog. His weariness was growing but his will hardened all the more. He thought he could see the light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch them up. Orcs go fast in tunnels, and this tunnel they knew well.; for in spite of Shelob they were forced to use it often as the swiftest way from the Dead City over the mountains. In what far-off time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been made, where Shelob had taken up her abode in ages past. they did not know: but many byways they had themselves delved about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters. Tonight they did not intend to go far down. but were hastening to find a side-passage that led back to their watch-tower on the cliff. Must of them were gleeful, delighted with what they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the fashion of their kind. Sam heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. The captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing up the rear, debating as they went. \u0027Can\u0027t you stop your rabble making such a racket, Shagrat? \u0027 grunted the one. \u0027We don\u0027t want Shelob on us.\u0027 \u0027Go on, Gorbag! Yours are making more than half the noise,\u0027 said the other. \u0027But let the lads play! No need to worry about Shelob for a bit, I reckon. She\u0027s sat on a nail, it seems, and we shan\u0027t cry about that. Didn\u0027t you see: a nasty mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers? If we\u0027ve stopped it once, we\u0027ve stopped it a hundred times. So let \u0027em laugh. And we\u0027ve struck a bit of luck at last: got something that Lugb畆z wants.\u0027 \u0027Lugb畆z wants it, eh? What is it, d\u0027you think? Elvish it looked to me, but undersized. What\u0027s the danger in a thing like that? \u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know till we\u0027ve had a look.\u0027 \u0027Oho! So they haven\u0027t told you what to expect? They don\u0027t tell us all they know, do they? Not by half. But they can make mistakes, even the Top Ones can.\u0027 \u0027Sh, Gorbag!\u0027 Shagrat\u0027s voice was lowered, so that even with his strangely sharpened hearing Sam could only just catch what was said. \u0027They may, but they\u0027ve got eyes and ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as not. But there\u0027s no doubt about it, they\u0027re troubled about something. The Nazgyl down below are, by your account; and Lugb畆z is too. Something nearly slipped.\u0027 \u0027Nearly, you say! \u0027 said Gorbag. \u0027All right,\u0027 said Shagrat, \u0027but we\u0027ll talk of that later: Wait till we get to the Under-way. There\u0027s a place there where we can talk a bit, while the lads go on.\u0027 Shortly afterwards Sam saw the torches disappear. Then there was a rumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. As far as he could guess the Orcs had turned and gone into the very opening which Frodo and he had tried and found blocked. It was still blocked. There seemed to be a great stone in the way, but the Orcs had got through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. They were still running along, deeper and deeper into the mountain, back towards the tower. Sam felt desperate. They were carrying off his master\u0027s body for some foul purpose and he could not follow. He thrust and pushed at the block, and he threw himself against it, but it did not yield. Then not far inside, or so he thought, he heard the two captains\u0027 voices talking again. He stood still listening for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful. Perhaps Gorbag, who seemed to belong to Minas Morgul, would come out, and he could then slip in. \u0027No, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Gorbag\u0027s voice. \u0027The messages go through quicker than anything could fly, as a rule. But I don\u0027t enquire how it\u0027s done. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazgyl give me the creeps. And they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side. But He likes \u0027em; they\u0027re His favourites nowadays, so it\u0027s no use grumbling. I tell you, it\u0027s no game serving down in the city.\u0027 \u0027You should try being up here with Shelob for company,\u0027 said Shagrat. \u0027I\u0027d like to try somewhere where there\u0027s none of \u0027em. But the war\u0027s on now, and when that\u0027s over things may be easier.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s going well, they say.\u0027 \u0027They would.\u0027 grunted Gorbag. \u0027We\u0027ll see. But anyway, if it does go well, there should be a lot more room. What d\u0027you say? -- if we get a chance, you and me\u0027ll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few trusty lads, somewhere where there\u0027s good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses.\u0027 \u0027Ah! \u0027 said Shagrat. \u0027Like old times.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Gorbag. \u0027But don\u0027t count on it. I\u0027m not easy in my mind. As I said, the Big Bosses, ay,\u0027 his voice sank almost to a whisper, \u0027ay, even the Biggest, can make mistakes. Something nearly slipped you say. I say, something has slipped. And we\u0027ve got to look out. Always the poor Uruks to put slips right, and small thanks. But don\u0027t forget: the enemies don\u0027t love us any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, we\u0027re done too. But see here: when were you ordered out? \u0027 \u0027About an hour ago, just before you saw us. A message came: Nazgyl uneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to head of Stairs. I came at once.\u0027 \u0027Bad business,\u0027 said Gorbag. \u0027See here -- our Silent Watchers were uneasy more than two days ago. that I know. But my patrol wasn\u0027t ordered out for another day, nor any message sent to Lugb畆z either: owing to the Great Signal going up, and the High Nazgyl going off to the war, and all that. And then they couldn\u0027t get Lugb畆z to pay attention for a good while, I\u0027m told.\u0027 \u0027The Eye was busy elsewhere, I suppose,\u0027 said Shagrat. \u0027Big things going on away west, they say.\u0027 \u0027I daresay,\u0027 growled Gorbag. \u0027But in the meantime enemies have got up the Stairs. And what were you up to? You\u0027re supposed to keep watch, aren\u0027t you, special orders or no? What are you for?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s enough! Don\u0027t try and teach me my job. We were awake all right. We knew there were funny things going on.\u0027 \u0027Very funny! \u0027 \u0027Yes, very funny: lights and shouting and all. But Shelob was on the go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.\u0027 \u0027Her Sneak? What\u0027s that? \u0027 \u0027You must have seen him: little thin black fellow; like a spider himself, or perhaps more like a starved frog. He\u0027s been here before. Came out of Lugb畆z the first time, years ago, and we had word from High Up to let him pass. He\u0027s been up the Stairs once or twice since then, but we\u0027ve left him alone: seems to have some understanding with Her Ladyship. I suppose he\u0027s no good to eat: she wouldn\u0027t worry about words from High Up. But a fine guard you keep in the valley: he was up here a day before all this racket. Early last night we saw him. Anyway my lads reported that Her Ladyship was having some fun, and that seemed good enough for me, until the message came. I thought her Sneak had brought her a toy. or that you\u0027d perhaps sent her a present, a prisoner of war or something. I don\u0027t interfere when she\u0027s playing. Nothing gets by Shelob when she\u0027s on the hunt.\u0027 \u0027Nothing, say you! Didn\u0027t you use your eyes back there? I tell you I\u0027m not easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, did get by. It cut her web and got clean out of the hole. That\u0027s something to think about! \u0027 \u0027Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn\u0027t she? \u0027 \u0027Got him? Got who? This little fellow? But if he was the only one then she\u0027d have had him off to her larder long before, and there he\u0027d be now. And if Lugb畆z wanted him, you\u0027d have to go and get him. Nice for you. But there was more than one.\u0027 At this point Sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear against the stone. \u0027Who cut the cords she\u0027d put round him, Shagrat? Same one as cut the web. Didn\u0027t you see that? And who stuck a pin into Her Ladyship? Same one, I reckon. And where is he? Where is he, Shagrat? \u0027 Shagrat made no reply. \u0027You may well put your thinking cap on, if you\u0027ve got one. It\u0027s no laughing matter. No one, no one has ever stuck a pin in Shelob before, as you should know well enough. There\u0027s no grief in that; but think-there\u0027s someone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel that ever walked since the bad old times, since the Great Siege. Something has slipped.\u0027 \u0027And what is it then? \u0027 growled Shagrat. \u0027By all the signs, Captain Shagrat, I\u0027d say there\u0027s a large warrior loose, Elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: and he\u0027s loose in your bounds, too, and you\u0027ve never spotted him. Very funny indeed! \u0027 Gorbag spat. Sam smiled grimly at this description of himself. \u0027Ah well, you always did take a gloomy view.\u0027 said Shagrat. \u0027You can read the signs how you like, but there may be other ways to explain them. Anyhow. I\u0027ve got watchers at every point, and I\u0027m going to deal with one thing at a time. When I\u0027ve had a look at the fellow we have caught, then I\u0027ll begin to worry 1cb2 about something else.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s my guess you won\u0027t find much in that little fellow,\u0027 said Gorbag. \u0027He may have had nothing to do with the real mischief. The big fellow with the sharp sword doesn\u0027t seem to have thought him worth much anyhow -- just left him lying: regular elvish trick.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll see. Come on now! We\u0027ve talked enough. Let\u0027s go and have a look at the prisoner! \u0027What are you going to do with him? Don\u0027t forget I spotted him first. If there\u0027s any game, me and my lads must be in it.\u0027 \u0027Now, now,\u0027 growled Shagrat. \u0027I have my orders. And it\u0027s more than my belly\u0027s worth, or yours, to break \u0027em. Any trespasser found by the guard is to be held at the tower. Prisoner is to be stripped. Full description of every article, garment, weapon, letter, ring. or trinket is to be sent to Lugb畆z at once, and to Lugb畆z only. And the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact, under pain of death for every member of the guard, until He sends or comes Himself. That\u0027s plain enough, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do.\u0027 \u0027Stripped, eh? \u0027 said Gorbag. \u0027What, teeth, nails, hair, and all? \u0027 \u0027No, none of that. He\u0027s for Lugb畆z, I tell you. He\u0027s wanted safe and whole.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll find that difficult,\u0027 laughed Gorbag. \u0027He\u0027s nothing but carrion now. What Lugb畆z will do with such stuff I can\u0027t guess. He might as well go in the pot.\u0027 \u0027You fool,\u0027 snarled Shagrat. \u0027You\u0027ve been talking very clever, but there\u0027s a lot you don\u0027t know, though most other folk do. You\u0027ll be for the pot or for Shelob, if you don\u0027t take care. Carrion! Is that all you know of Her Ladyship? When she binds with cords, she\u0027s after meat. She doesn\u0027t eat dead meat, nor suck cold blood. This fellow isn\u0027t dead! \u0027 Sam reeled, clutching at the stone. He felt as if the whole dark world was turning upside down. So great was the shock that he almost swooned, but even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses, deep inside him he was aware of the comment: \u0027You fool, he isn\u0027t dead, and your heart knew it. Don\u0027t trust your head, Samwise, it is not the best part of you. The trouble with you is that you never really had any hope. Now what is to be done? \u0027 Fur the moment nothing, but to prop himself against the unmoving stone and listen, listen to the vile orc-voices. \u0027Garn!\u0027 said Shagrat. \u0027She\u0027s got more than one poison. When she\u0027s hunting, she just gives \u0027em a dab in the neck and they go as limp as boned fish, and then she has her way with them. D\u0027you remember old Ufthak? We lost him for days. Then we found him in a corner; hanging up he was, but he was wide awake and glaring. How we laughed! She\u0027d forgotten him, maybe, but we didn\u0027t touch him-no good interfering with Her. Nar -- this little filth, he\u0027ll wake up, in a few hours; and beyond feeling a bit sick for a hit, he\u0027ll be all right. Or would be, if Lugb畆z would let him alone. And of course, beyond wondering where he is and what\u0027s happened to him.\u0027 \u0027And what\u0027s going to happen to him,\u0027 laughed Gorbag. \u0027We can tell him a few stories at any rate, if we can\u0027t do anything else. I don\u0027t suppose he\u0027s ever been in lovely Lugb畆z, so he may like to know what to expect. This is going to be more funny than I thought. Let\u0027s go!\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s going to be no fun, I tell you,\u0027 said Shagrat. \u0027And he\u0027s got to be kept safe, or we\u0027re all as good as dead.\u0027 \u0027AII right! But if I were you, I\u0027d catch the big one that\u0027s loose, before you send in any report to Lugb畆z. It won\u0027t sound too pretty to say you\u0027ve caught the kitten and let the cat escape.\u0027 The voices began to move away. Sam heard the sound of feet receding. He was recovering from his shock, and now a wild fury was on him. \u0027I got it all wrong! \u0027 he cried. \u0027I knew I would. Now they\u0027ve got him, the devils! the filth! Never leave your master, never, never: that was my right rule. And I knew it in my heart. May I be forgiven! Now I\u0027ve got to get back to him. Somehow, somehow! \u0027 He drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt, but it only gave out a dull sound. The sword, however, blazed so brightly now that he could see dimly in its light. To his surprise he noticed that the great block was shaped like a heavy door, and was less than twice his own height. Above it was a dark blank space between the top and the low arch of the opening. It was probably only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of Shelob, fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning. With his remaining strength Sam leaped and caught the top, scrambled up, and dropped; and then he ran madly, sword blazing in hand, round a bend and up a winding tunnel. The news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort beyond thought of weariness. He could not see anything ahead. for this new passage twisted and turned constantly; but he thought he was catching the two Orcs up: their voices were growing nearer again. Now they seemed quite close. \u0027That\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do,\u0027 said Shagrat in angry tones. \u0027Put him right up in the top chamber.\u0027 \u0027What for? \u0027 growled Gorbag. \u0027Haven\u0027t you any lock-ups down below? \u0027 \u0027He\u0027s going out of harm\u0027s way, I tell you,\u0027 answered Shagrat. \u0027See? He\u0027s precious. I don\u0027t trust all my lads, and none of yours; nor you neither, when you\u0027re mad for fun. He\u0027s going where I want him, and where you won\u0027t come, if you don\u0027t keep civil. Up to the top, I say. He\u0027ll be safe there.\u0027 \u0027Will he?\u0027 said Sam. \u0027You\u0027re forgetting the great big elvish warrior that\u0027s loose!\u0027 And with that he raced round the last corner, only to find that by some trick of the tunnel, or of the hearing which the Ring gave him, he had misjudged the distance. The two orc-figures were still some way ahead. He could see them now, black and squat against a red glare. The passage ran straight at last, up an incline; and at the end, wide open, were great double doors, leading probably to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower. Already the Orcs with their burden had passed inside. Gorbag and Shagrat were drawing near the gate. Sam heard a burst of hoarse singing, blaring of horns and banging of gongs, a hideous clamour. Gorbag and Shagrat were already on the threshold. Sam yelled and brandished Sting, but his little voice was drowned in the tumult. No one heeded him. The great doors slammed to. Boom. The bars of iron fell into place inside. Clang. The gate was shut. Sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground. He was out in the darkness. Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy. Here ends the second part of the history of the War of the Ring. The third part tells of the last defence against the Shadow, and the end of the mission of the Ring-bearer in THE RETURN OF THE KING.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/47/209.html","bookId":836,"book":{"id":836,"title":"The Two Towers双塔奇兵","description":"简介： 护戒联盟中的哈比人梅里与皮平被奥克斯掳走，护戒使者们不得不分头行事。弗拉多与好友山姆继续向索隆领地莫都进发，途中他们制服了也在疯狂寻找魔戒的怪物古鲁姆，魔戒曾经为他带来了长寿与隐身之道直到弗拉多的前辈毕尔博拿走了这枚戒指。由于通向莫都的路途十分艰险，...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1285403016512bd.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/47","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:04 AM"}}
