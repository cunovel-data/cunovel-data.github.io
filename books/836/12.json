{"id":24563,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 13 The Passage of the Marshes","content":"Gollum moved quickly, with his head and neck thrust forward, often using his hands as well as his feet. Frodo and Sam were hard put to it to keep up with him; but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping, and if they fell behind, he would turn and wait for them. After a time he brought them to the brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before; but they were now further from the hills. \u0027Here it is!\u0027 he cried. \u0027There is a way down inside, yes. Now we follows it -- out, out away over there.\u0027 He pointed south and east towards the marshes. The reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy and foul even in the cool night air. .\n Gollum cast up and down along the brink, and at length he called to them. \u0027Here! We can get down here. Smjagol went this way once: I went this way, hiding from Orcs.\u0027\n He led the way, and following him the hobbits climbed down into the gloom. It was not difficult, for the rift was at this point only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across. There was running water at the bottom: it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond. Gollum turned to the right, southward more or less, and splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream. He seemed greatly delighted to feel the water, and chuckled to himself, sometimes even croaking in a sort of song.\n \u0027Ha! ha! What does we wish?\u0027 he said, looking sidelong at the hobbits. \u0027We\u0027ll tell you.\u0027 he croaked. \u0027He guessed it long ago, Baggins guessed it.\u0027 A glint came into his eyes, and Sam catching the gleam in the darkness thought it far from pleasant.\n These words only made more pressing to Sam\u0027s mind a problem that had been troubling him from the moment when he understood that hir master was going to adopt Gollum as a guide: the problem of food. It did not occur to him that his master might also have thought of it. hut he supposed Gollum had. Indeed how had Gollum kept himself in all his lonely wandering? \u0027Not too well,\u0027 thought Sam. \u0027He looks fair famished. Not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if there ain\u0027t no fish, I\u0027ll wager -- supposing as he could catch us napping. Well, he won\u0027t: not Sam Gamgee for one.\u0027\n They stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it seemed to the tired feet of Frodo and Sam. The gully turned eastward, and as they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. At last the sky above grew faint with the first grey of morning. Gollum had shown no signs of tiring, but now he looked up and halted. \u0027Day is near,\u0027 he whispered, as if Day was something that might overhear him and spring on him. \u0027Smjagol will stay here: I will stay here, and the Yellow Face won\u0027t see me.\u0027 \u0027We should be glad to see the Sun;\u0027 said Frodo, \u0027but we will stay here: we are too tired to go any further at present.\u0027 \u0027You are not wise to be glad of the Yellow Face,\u0027 said Gollum. \u0027It shows you up. Nice sensible hobbits stay with Smjagol. Orcs and nasty things are about. They can see a long way. Stay and hide with me! \u0027\n The three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully. It was not much more than a tall man\u0027s height now, and at its base there were wide flat shelves of dry stone; the water ran in a channel on the other side. Frodo and Sam sat on one of the flats, resting their backs. Gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream. \u0027We must take a little food,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Are you hungry, Smjagol? We have very little to share, but we will spare you what we can.\u0027\n At the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in Gollum\u0027s pale eyes, and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face. For a moment he relapsed into his old Gollum-manner. \u0027We are famisshed, yes famisshed we are. precious,\u0027 he said. \u0027What is it they eats? Have they nice fisshes? \u0027 His tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth. licking his colourless lips. \u0027No, we have got no fish,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027We have only got this\u0027 -- he held up a wafer of lembas -- \u0027and water, if the water here is fit to drink.\u0027 \u0027Yess, yess, nice water,\u0027 said Gollum. \u0027Drink it, drink it, while we can! But what is it they\u0027ve got, precious? Is it crunchable? Is it tasty? \u0027\n Frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its leaf-wrapping. Gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed: a spasm of disgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice. \u0027Smjagol smells it! \u0027 he said. \u0027Leaves out of the elf-country, gah! They stinks. He climbed in those trees, and he couldn\u0027t wash the smell off his hands, my nice hands.\u0027 Dropping the leaf, he took a corner of the lembas and nibbled it. He spat, and a fit of coughing shook him. \u0027Ach! No! \u0027 he spluttered. \u0027You try to choke poor Smjagol. Dust and ashes, he can\u0027t eat that. He must starve. But Smjagol doesn\u0027t mind. Nice hobbits! Smjagol has promised. He will starve. He can\u0027t eat hobbits\u0027 food. He will starve. Poor thin Smjagol! \u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 said Frodo; \u0027but I can\u0027t help you, I\u0027m afraid. I think this food would do you good, if you would try. But perhaps you can\u0027t even try, not yet anyway.\u0027\n The hobbits munched their lembas in silence. Sam thought that it tasted far better, somehow, than it had for a good while: Gollum\u0027s behaviour had made him attend to its flavour again. But he did not feel comfortable. Gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth, like an expectant dog by a diner\u0027s chair. Only when they had finished and were preparing to rest, was he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share in. Then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little.\n \u0027Look here! \u0027 Sam whispered to Frodo, not too softly: he did not really care whether Gollum heard him or not. \u0027We\u0027ve got to get some sleep; but not both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no promise. Smjagol or Gollum, he won\u0027t change his habits in a hurry, I\u0027ll warrant. You go to sleep, Mr. Frodo, and I\u0027ll call you when I can\u0027t keep my eyelids propped up. Turn and about, same as before, while he\u0027s loose.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps you\u0027re right, Sam,\u0027 said Frodo speaking openly. \u0027There is a change in him, but just what kind of a change and how deep, I\u0027m not sure yet. Seriously though, I don\u0027t think there is any need for fear -- at present. Still watch if you wish. Give me about two hours, not more, and then call me.\u0027\n So tired was Frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he slept. almost as soon as he had spoken the words. Gollum seemed no longer to have any fears. He curled up and went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned. Presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth, hut he lay still as stone. After a while, fearing that he would drop off himself, if he sat listening to his two companions breathing, Sam got up and gently prodded Gollum. His hands uncurled and twitched, but he made no other movement. Sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear, but there was no response, not even a catch in Gollum\u0027s breathing.\n Sam scratched his head. \u0027Must really be asleep,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027And if I was like Gollum, he wouldn\u0027t wake up never again.\u0027 He restrained the thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and went and sat down by his master.\n When he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted. Sam leapt to his feet. Not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away, nine hours at least. Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched on his side. Gollum was not to be seen. Various reproachful names for himself came to Sam\u0027s mind, drawn from the Gaffer\u0027s large paternal word-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right: there had for the present been nothing to guard against. They were at any rate both alive and unthrottled.\n \u0027Poor wretch! \u0027 he said half remorsefully. \u0027Now I wonder where he\u0027s got to? \u0027\n \u0027Not far, not far! \u0027 said a voice above him. He looked up and saw the shape of Gollum\u0027s large head and ears against the evening sky.\n \u0027Here, what are you doing? \u0027 cried Sam, his suspicions coming back as soon as he saw that shape. \u0027Smjagol is hungry,\u0027 said Gollum. \u0027Be back soon.\u0027\n \u0027Come back now!\u0027 shouted Sam. \u0027Hi! Come back!\u0027 But Gollum had vanished.\n Frodo woke at the sound of Sam\u0027s shout and sat up, rubbing his eyes. \u0027Hullo!\u0027 he said. \u0027Anything wrong? What\u0027s the time?\u0027\n \u0027I dunno,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027After sundown, I reckon. And he\u0027s gone off. Says he\u0027s hungry.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t worry!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027There\u0027s no help for it. But he\u0027ll come back, you\u0027ll see. The promise will hold yet a while. And he won\u0027t leave his Precious, anyway.\u0027\n Frodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for hours with Gollum, and a very hungry Gollum too, loose beside them. \u0027Don\u0027t think of any of your Gaffer\u0027s hard names,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were worn out, and it has turned out well: we are now both rested. And we have a hard road ahead, the worst road of all.\u0027 \u0027About the food,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027How long\u0027s it going to take us to do this job? And when it\u0027s done, what are we going to do then? This waybread keeps you on your legs in a wonderful way, though it doesn\u0027t satisfy the innards proper, as you might say: not to my feeling anyhow, meaning no disrespect to them as made it. But you have to eat some of it every day, and it doesn\u0027t grow. I reckon we\u0027ve got enough to last, say, three weeks or so, and that with a tight belt and a light tooth, mind you. We\u0027ve been a bit free with it so far.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know how long we shall take to -- to finish,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027We were miserably delayed in the hills. But Samwise Gamgee, my dear hobbit -- indeed, Sam my dearest hobbit, friend of friends -- I do not think we need give thought to what comes after that. To do the job as you put it -- what hope is there that we ever shall? And if we do, who knows what will come of that? If the One goes into the Fire, and we are at hand? I ask you, Sam, are we ever likely to need bread again? I think not. If we can nurse our limbs to bring us to Mount Doom, that is all we can do. More than I can, I begin to feel.\u0027\n Sam nodded silently. He took his master\u0027s hand and bent over it. He did not kiss it, though his tears fell on it. Then he turned away, drew his sleeve over his nose, and got up, and stamped about, trying to whistle, and saying between the efforts: \u0027Where\u0027s that dratted creature?\u0027\n It was actually not long before Gollum returned; but he came so quietly that they did not hear him till he stood before them. His fingers and face were soiled with black mud. He was still chewing and slavering. What he was chewing, they did not ask or like to think.\n \u0027Worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes,\u0027 thought Sam. \u0027Brr! The nasty creature; the poor wretch! \u0027\n Gollum said nothing to them, until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stream. Then he came up to them, licking his lips. \u0027Better now,\u0027 he said. \u0027Are we rested? Ready to go on? Nice hobbits, they sleep beautifully. Trust Smjagol now? Very, very good.\u0027\n The next stage of their journey was much the same as the last. As they went on the gully became ever shallower and the slope of its floor more gradual. Its bottom was less stony and more earthy, and slowly its sides dwindled to mere banks. It began to wind and wander. That night drew to its end, but clouds were now over moon and star, and they knew of the coming of day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light.\n In a chill hour they came to the end of the water-course. The banks became moss-grown mounds. Over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled and fell down into a brown bog and was lost. Dry reeds hissed and rattled though they could feel no wind.\n On either side and in front wide fens and mires now lay, stretching away southward and eastward into the dim half-light. Mists curled and smoked from dark and noisome pools. The reek of them hung stifling in the still air. Far away, now almost due south, the mountain-walls of Mordor loomed, like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog-bound sea.\n The hobbits were now wholly in the hands of Gollum. They did now know, and could not guess in that misty light. that they were in fact only just within the northern borders of the marshes. the main expanse of which lay south of them. They could, if they had known the lands, with some delay have retraced their steps a little, and then turning east have come round over hard roads to the bare plain of Dagorlad: the field of the ancient battle before the gates of Mordor. Not that there was great hope in such a course. On that stony plain there was no cover, and across it ran the highways of the Orcs and the soldiers of the Enemy. Not even the cloaks of Lurien would have concealed them there.\n \u0027How do we shape our course now, Smjagol? \u0027 asked Frodo. \u0027Must we cross these evil-smelling fens? \u0027 \u0027No need, no need at all,\u0027 said Gollum. \u0027Not if hobbits want to reach the dark mountains and go to see Him very quick. Back a little, and round a little\u0027 -- his skinny arm waved north and east -- \u0027and you can come on hard cold roads to the very gates of His country. Lots of His people will be there looking out for guests, very pleased to take them straight to Him, O yes. His Eye watches that way all the time. It caught Smjagol there, long ago.\u0027 Gollum shuddered. \u0027But Smjagol has used his eyes since then, yes, yes: I\u0027ve used eyes and feet and nose since then. l know other ways. More difficult, not so quick; but better, if we don\u0027t want Him to see. Follow Smjagol! He can take you through the marshes, through the mists. nice thick mists. Follow Smjagol very carefully, and you may go a long way. quite a long way, before He catches you, yes perhaps.\u0027\n It was already day, a windless and sullen morning, and the marsh-reeks lay in heavy banks. No sun pierced the low clouded sky, and Gollum seemed anxious to continue the journey at once. So after a brief rest they set out again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of the lands about, either the hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought. They went slowly in single file: Gollum, Sam, Frodo.\n Frodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they went. he often lagged. The hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vast fen was really an endless network of pools, and soft mires. and winding half-strangled water-courses. Among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path. Gollum certainly had that cunning, and needed all of it. His head on its long neck was ever turning this way and that, while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself. Sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them, while he went forward a little, crouching, testing the ground with fingers or toes. or merely listening with one ear pressed to the earth.\n It was dreary and wearisome. Cold clammy winter still held sway in this forsaken country. The only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark greasy surfaces of the sullen waters. Dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers.\n As the day wore on the light increased a little, and the mists lifted, growing thinner and more transparent. Far above the rot and vapours of the world the Sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors of dazzling foam, but only a passing ghost of her could they see below, bleared, pale, giving no colour and no warmth. But even at this faint reminder of her presence Gollum scowled and flinched. He halted their journey, and they rested, squatting like little hunted animals, in the borders of a great brown reed-thicket. There was a deep silence, only scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed-plumes, and broken grass-blades trembling in small air-movements that they could not feel.\n \u0027Not a bird! \u0027 said Sam mournfully. \u0027No, no birds,\u0027 said Gollum. \u0027Nice birds! \u0027 He licked his teeth. \u0027No birds here. There are snakeses, wormses, things in the pools. Lots of things, lots of nasty things. No birds,\u0027 he ended sadly. Sam looked at him with distaste.\n So passed the third day of their journey with Gollum. Before the shadows of evening were long in happier lands, they went on again, always on and on with only brief halts. These they made not so much for rest as to help Gollum; for now even he had to go forward with great care, and he was sometimes at a loss for a while. They had come to the very midst of the Dead Marshes, and it was dark.\n They walked slowly, stooping, keeping close in line, following attentively every move that Gollum made. The fens grew more wet, opening into wide stagnant meres, among which it grew more and more difficult to find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling mud. The travellers were light, or maybe none of them would ever have found a way through.\n Presently it grew altogether dark: the air itself seemed black and heavy to breathe. When lights appeared Sam rubbed his eyes: he thought his head was going queer. He first saw one with the corner of his left eye, a wisp of pale sheen that faded away; but others appeared soon after: some like dimly shining smoke, some like misty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands. But neither of his companions spoke a word.\n At last Sam could bear it no longer. \u0027What\u0027s all this, Gollum? \u0027 he said in a whisper. \u0027These lights? They\u0027re all round us now. Are we trapped? Who are they? \u0027\n Gollum looked up. A dark water was before him, and he was crawling on the ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. \u0027Yes, they are all round us,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027The tricksy lights. Candles of corpses, yes, yes. Don\u0027t you heed them! Don\u0027t look! Don\u0027t follow them! Where\u0027s the master? \u0027\n Sam looked back and found that Frodo had lagged again. He could not see him. He went some paces back into the darkness, not daring to move far, or to call in more than a hoarse whisper. Suddenly he stumbled against Frodo, who was standing lost in thought, looking at the pale lights. His hands hung stiff at his sides; water and slime were dripping from them. \u0027Come, Mr. Frodo! \u0027 said Sam. \u0027Don\u0027t look at them! Gollum says we mustn\u0027t. Let\u0027s keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as we can -- if we can! \u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 said Frodo, as if returning out of a dream. \u0027I\u0027m coming. Go on! \u0027\n Hurrying forward again, Sam tripped, catching his foot in some old root or tussock. He fell and came heavily on his hands, which sank deep into sticky ooze, so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark mere. There was a faint hiss, a noisome smell went up, the lights flickered and danced and swirled. For a moment the water below him looked like some window, glazed with grimy glass, through which he was peering. Wrenching his hands out of the bog, he sprang back with a cry. \u0027There are dead things, dead faces in the water,\u0027 he said with horror. \u0027Dead faces! \u0027\n Gollum laughed. \u0027The Dead Marshes, yes, yes: that is their names,\u0027 he cackled. \u0027You should not look in when the candles are lit.\u0027 \u0027Who are they? What are they? \u0027 asked Sam shuddering, turning to Frodo, who was now behind him.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Frodo in a dreamlike voice. \u0027But I have seen them too. In the pools when the candles were lit. They lie in all the pools, pale faces, deep deep under the dark water. I saw them: grim faces and evil, and noble faces and sad. Many faces proud and fair, and weeds in their silver hair. But all foul, all rotting, all dead. A fell light is in them.\u0027 Frodo hid his eyes in his hands. \u0027I know not who they are; but I thought I saw there Men and Elves, and Orcs beside them.\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 said Gollum. \u0027All dead, all rotten. Elves and Men and Orcs. The Dead Marshes. There was a great battle long ago, yes, so they told him when Smjagol was young, when I was young before the Precious came. It was a great battle. Tall Men with long swords, and terrible Elves, and Orcses shrieking. They fought on the plain for days and months at the Black Gates. But the Marshes have grown since then, swallowed up the graves; always creeping, creeping.\u0027\n \u0027But that is an age and more ago,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027The Dead can\u0027t be really there! Is it some devilry hatched in the Dark Land? \u0027 \u0027Who knows? Smjagol doesn\u0027t know,\u0027 answered Gollum. \u0027You cannot reach them, you cannot touch them. We tried once, .yes, precious. I tried once; but you cannot reach them. Only shapes to see, perhaps, not to touch. No precious! All dead.\u0027\n Sam looked darkly at him and shuddered again, thinking that he guessed why Smjagol had tried to touch them. \u0027Well, I don\u0027t want to see them,\u0027 he said. \u0027Never again! Can\u0027t we get on and get away? \u0027 \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 said Gollum. \u0027But slowly, very slowly. Very carefully! Or hobbits go down to join the Dead ones and light little candles. Follow Smjagol! Don\u0027t look at lights! \u0027\n He crawled away to the right, seeking for a path round the mere. They came close behind, stooping, often using their hands even as he did. \u0027Three precious little Gollums in a row we shall be, if this goes on much longer,\u0027 thought Sam.\n At last they came to the end of the black mere, and they crossed it, perilously, crawling or hopping from one treacherous island tussock to another. Often they floundered, stepping or falling hands-first into waters as noisome as a cesspool, till they were slimed and fouled almost up to their necks and stank in one another\u0027s nostrils.\n It was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground again. Gollum hissed and whispered to himself, but it appeared that he was pleased: in some mysterious way, by some blended sense of feel, and smell, and uncanny memory for shapes in the dark, he seemed to know just where he was again, and to be sure of his road ahead. \u0027Now on we go! \u0027 he said. \u0027Nice hobbits! Brave hobbits! Very very weary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. But we must take master away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.\u0027 With these words he started off again, almost at a trot, down what appeared to be a long lane between high reeds, and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could. But in a little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully, hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again.\n \u0027What is it? \u0027 growled Sam, misinterpreting the signs. \u0027What\u0027s the need to sniff? The stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held. You stink, and master stinks; the whole place stinks.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, yes, and Sam stinks! \u0027 answered Gollum. \u0027Poor Smjagol smells it, but good Smjagol bears it. Helps nice master. But that\u0027s no matter. The air\u0027s moving, change is coming. Smjagol wonders; he\u0027s not happy.\u0027\n He went on again, but his uneasiness grew, and every now and again he stood up to his full height, craning his neck eastward and southward. For some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him. Then suddenly all three halted, stiffening and listening. To Frodo and Sam it seemed that they heard, far away, a long wailing cry, high and thin and cruel. They shivered. At the same moment the stirring of the air became perceptible to them; and it grew very cold. As they stood straining their ears, they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance. The misty lights wavered, dimmed, and went out.\n Gollum would not move. He stood shaking and gibbering to himself, until with a rush the wind came upon them, hissing and snarling over the marshes. The night became less dark, light enough for them to see, or half see, shapeless drifts of fog, curling and twisting as it rolled over them and passed them. Looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then high in the south the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack.\n For a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but Gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face. Then Frodo and Sam staring at the sky, breathing deeply of the fresher air, saw it come: a small cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from Mordor; a vast shape winged and ominous. It scudded across the moon, and with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed.\n They fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth. But the shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing lower now, right above them, sweeping the fen-reek with its ghastly wings. And then it was gone, flying back to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron; and behind it the wind roared away, leaving the Dead Marshes bare and bleak. The naked waste, as far as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, was dappled with the fitful moonlight.\n Frodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. But Gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned. They roused him with difficulty, and for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on his elbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands. \u0027Wraiths!\u0027 he wailed. \u0027Wraiths on wings! The Precious is their master. They see everything, everything. Nothing can hide from them. Curse the White Face! And they tell Him everything. He sees, He knows. Ach, gollum, gollum, gollum! \u0027 It was not until the moon had sunk, westering far beyond Tol Brandir, that he would get up or make a move.\n From that time on Sam thought that he sensed a change in Gollum again. He was more fawning and would-be friendly; but Sam surprised some strange looks in his eyes at times, especially towards Frodo; and he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking. And Sam had another growing anxiety. Frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said nothing. indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he walked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind.\n In fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards. But far more he was troubled by the Eye: so he called it to himself. It was that more than the drag of the Ring that made him cower and stoop as he walked. The Eye: that horrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud, and earth, and flesh, and to see you: to pin you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the veils were become that still warded it off. Frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its potency beat upon his brow.\n Gollum probably felt something of the same sort. But what went on in his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring that was so near, and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold iron, the hobbits did not guess: Frodo gave no thought to it. Sam\u0027s mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart. He put Frodo in front of him now, and kept a watchful eye on every movement of his, supporting him if he stumbled, and trying to encourage him with clumsy words.\n When day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn. The air was now clearer and colder, and though still far off, the walls of Mordor were no longer a cloudy menace on the edge of sight, but as grim black towers they frowned across a dismal waste. The marshes were at an end, dying away into dead peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud. The land ahead rose in long shallow slopes, barren and pitiless, towards the desert that lay at Sauron\u0027s gate.\n While the grey light lasted, they cowered under a black stone like worms, shrinking, lest the winged terror should pass and spy them with its cruel eyes. The remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon. For two more nights they struggled on through the weary pathless land. The air, as it seemed to them, grew harsh, and filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths.\n At last, on the fifth morning since they took the road with Gollum, they halted once more. Before them dark in the dawn the great mountains reached up to roofs of smoke and cloud. Out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and broken hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen miles away. Frodo looked round in horror. Dreadful as the Dead Marshes had been, and the arid moors of the Noman-lands, more loathsome far was the country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes. Even to the Mere of Dead Faces some haggard phantom of green spring would come; but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again. Here nothing lived, not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness. The gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about. High mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted and poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly revealed in the reluctant light.\n They had come to the desolation that lay before Mordor: the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their purposes were made void; a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing -- unless the Great Sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion. \u0027I feel sick,\u0027 said Sam. Frodo did not speak.\n For a while they stood there, like men on the edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only come to morning through the shadows. The light broadened and hardened. The gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear. The sun was up, walking among clouds and long flags of smoke, but even the sunlight was defiled. The hobbits had no welcome for that light; unfriendly it seemed, revealing them in their helplessness -- little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the ash-heaps of the Dark Lord.\n Too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest. For a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of slag; but foul fumes leaked out of it, catching their throats and choking them. Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering and cursing he rose, and without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours. Frodo and Sam crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular pit, high-banked upon the west. It was cold and dead, and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom. In this evil hole they cowered, hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye.\n The day passed slowly. A great thirst troubled them, but they drank only a few drops from their bottles-last filled in the gully, which now as they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty. The hobbits took it in turn to watch. At first, tired as they were, neither of them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo\u0027s turn to bc on guard. He lay back on the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him. He looked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark riding shapes, and faces out of the past. He lost count of time, hovering between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him.\n Suddenly Sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling. It was evening. Frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit. Gollum was by him. For a moment Sam thought that he was trying to rouse Frodo; then he saw that it was not so. Gollum was talking to himself. Smjagol was holding a debate with some other thought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss. A pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke. \u0027Smjagol promised,\u0027 said the first thought. \u0027Yes, yes, my precious,\u0027 came the answer, \u0027we promised: to save our Precious, not to let Him have it -- never. But it\u0027s going to Him yes, nearer every step. What\u0027s the hobbit going to do with it, we wonders, yes we wonders.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t help it. Master\u0027s got it. Smjagol promised to help the master.\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes, to help the master: the master of the Precious. But if we was master, then we could help ourselfs, yes, and still keep promises.\u0027 \u0027But Smjagol said he would be very very good. Nice hobbit! He took cruel rope off Smjagol\u0027s leg. He speaks nicely to me.\u0027\n \u0027Very very good, eh, my precious? Let\u0027s be good, good as fish, sweet one, but to ourselfs. Not hurt the nice hobbit, of course, no, no.\u0027 \u0027But the Precious holds the promise,\u0027 the voice of Smjagol objected. \u0027Then take it,\u0027 said the other, \u0027and let\u0027s hold it ourselfs! Then we shall be master, gollum! Make the other hobbit, the nasty suspicious hobbit, make him crawl, yes, gollum!\u0027 \u0027But not the nice hobbit? \u0027 \u0027Oh no, not if it doesn\u0027t please us. Still he\u0027s a Baggins, my precious, yes, a Baggins. A Baggins stole it. He found it and he said nothing, nothing. We hates Bagginses.\u0027\n \u0027No, not this Baggins.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, every Baggins. All peoples that keep the Precious. We must have it! \u0027 \u0027But He\u0027ll see, He\u0027ll know. He\u0027ll take it from us! \u0027\n \u0027He sees. He knows. He heard us make silly promises -- against His orders, yes. Must take it. The Wraiths are searching. Must take it.\u0027\n \u0027Not for Him! \u0027\n \u0027No, sweet one. See, my precious: if we has it, then we can escape, even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord Smjagol? Gollum the Great? The Gollum! Eat fish every day, three times a day; fresh from the sea. Most Precious Gollum! Must have it. We wants it, we wants it, we wants it! \u0027\n \u0027But there\u0027s two of them. They\u0027ll wake too quick and kill us,\u0027 whined Smjagol in a last effort. \u0027Not now. Not yet.\u0027\n \u0027We wants it! But\u0027 -- and here there was a long pause, as if a new thought had wakened. \u0027Not yet, eh? Perhaps not. She might help. She might, yes.\u0027 \u0027No, no! Not that way! \u0027 wailed Smjagol. \u0027Yes! We wants it! We wants it! \u0027\n Each time that the second thought spoke, Gollum\u0027s long hand crept out slowly, pawing towards Frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as Smjagol spoke again. Finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twitching, clawed towards his neck.\n Sam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move that Gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. To his simple mind ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in Gollum. He realized now that it was not so: Gollum was feeling the terrible call of the Ring. The Dark Lord was He, of course; but Sam wondered who She was. One of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings, he supposed. Then he forgot the point, for things had plainly gone far enough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness was in all his limbs, but he roused himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate. He let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn. \u0027What\u0027s the time? \u0027 he said sleepily.\n Gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth. He stood up for a moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all fours and crawling up the bank of the pit. \u0027Nice hobbits! Nice Sam! \u0027 he said. \u0027Sleepy heads, yes, sleepy heads! Leave good Smjagol to watch! But it\u0027s evening. Dusk is creeping. Time to go.\u0027 \u0027High time! \u0027 thought Sam. \u0027And time we parted, too.\u0027 Yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them. \u0027Curse him! I wish he was choked!\u0027 he muttered. He stumbled down the bank and roused his master.\n Strangely enough, Frodo felt refreshed. He had been dreaming. The dark shadow had passed, and a fair vision had visited him in this land of disease. Nothing remained of it in his memory, yet because of it he felt glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. Gollum welcomed him with dog-like delight. He chuckled and chattered, cracking his long fingers, and pawing at Frodo\u0027s knees. Frodo smiled at him.\n \u0027Come! \u0027 he said. \u0027You have guided us well and faithfully. This is the last stage. Bring us to the Gate, and then I will not ask you to go further. Bring us to the Gate, and you may go where you wish -- only not to our enemies.\u0027\n \u0027To the Gate, eh?\u0027 Gollum squeaked, seeming surprised and frightened. \u0027To the Gate, master says! Yes, he says so. And good Smjagol does what he asks, O yes. But when we gets closer, we\u0027ll see perhaps we\u0027ll see then. It won\u0027t look nice at all. O no! O no!\u0027\n \u0027Go on with you! \u0027 said Sam. \u0027Let\u0027s get it over! \u0027\n In the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land. They had not gone far before they felt once more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the marshes. They halted, cowering on the evil-smelling ground; but they saw nothing in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the menace passed, high overhead, going maybe on some swift errand from Barad-dyr. After a while Gollum got up and crept forward again, muttering and shaking.\n About an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time, but it now seemed more remote, as if it were passing far above the clouds, rushing with terrible speed into the West. Gollum, however, was helpless with terror, and was convinced that they were being hunted, that their approach was known. \u0027Three times! \u0027 he whimpered. \u0027Three times is a threat. They feel us here, they feel the Precious. The Precious is their master. We cannot go any further this way, no. It\u0027s no use, no use! \u0027\n Pleading and kind words were no longer of any avail. It was not until Frodo commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword-hilt that Gollum would get up again. Then at last he rose with a snarl, and went before them like a beaten dog.\n So they stumbled on through the weary end of the night, and until the coming of another day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads, seeing nothing, and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/47/202.html","bookId":836,"book":{"id":836,"title":"The Two Towers双塔奇兵","description":"简介： 护戒联盟中的哈比人梅里与皮平被奥克斯掳走，护戒使者们不得不分头行事。弗拉多与好友山姆继续向索隆领地莫都进发，途中他们制服了也在疯狂寻找魔戒的怪物古鲁姆，魔戒曾经为他带来了长寿与隐身之道直到弗拉多的前辈毕尔博拿走了这枚戒指。由于通向莫都的路途十分艰险，...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1285403016512bd.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/47","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:04 AM"}}
