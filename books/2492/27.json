{"id":105339,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Love wasn\u0027t rational. \"In summary,\" Chen said, using her Nazi march across the stage, a pulse-mike attached to the lapel of her Sensible Black Suit, \"there are sufficient grief counselors for any student that wishes to discuss yesterday\u0027s incident involving Thomas Proctor.\" She looked out over the sea of faces, many of which had taken the time to glance at Sophie and Buddy. She actually looked worse than Buddy. Probably because she hadn\u0027t been able to defend herself. I would have given a lot to see Buddy and the attacker. I wondered what that guy looked like. I really did. \"No one need shoulder this grief on their own. Thank you for your attention,\" she finished. I guess I was just desensitized to everything, being a Cadaver-Manipulator and all. I sorta felt he had been neglectful with Sophie. He shouldn\u0027t have tempted fate after that Amanda chick had almost been a casualty. Chen got down off the stage and we were dismissed from assembly. Waste of time but there were actually students crying. Brother. Sophie was crying. But I\u0027d give her that. Jonesy watched her with a frustrated look on his face. \"God I want to mangle that prick that did that to Soph,\" he said to me in a low voice, his fists clenched as he watched Buddy and Sophie together. Her nose was red from crying, her face distorted on the side that\u0027d been hit. \"I hear that, man,\" I clapped him on the shoulder. If someone touched Jade I\u0027d have a physical reaction. I knew because I had. Speaking of that I turned toward her and motioned her over. \"Hey.\" \"How\u0027s she doin\u0027?\" I motioned with my head toward Buddy and Sophie. She shrugged. \"Still kinda shaky. It was okay with the Null last night. She didn\u0027t think she\u0027d get any sleep but she did sleep.\" \"Good.\" I looked at her and she put her hand on my arm, the palm burning my skin. Everyone melted away around us and her mouth made a little \"O.\" She may know what I was thinking about now. \"He hasn\u0027t been back,\" she said. The J\u0027s looked at her. \"Who?\" Jonesy asked. \"My dad,\" she whispered. \"What about Andrea?\" I asked. \"She was pissed that I said something, of course.\" That didn\u0027t make sense to me. You\u0027d think she\u0027d want the cops involved, protecting the two of them. She nodded. \"Yeah, I know, it\u0027s weird but it\u0027s like a code in our house.\" \"What is code?\" John asked. \"Not telling,\" she said automatically. \"I could never do the code,\" Tiff said, hearing that last. Jade shrugged. \"I know it\u0027s not normal, but it\u0027s all I knew before I lived with Aunt Andrea. And that is all she knows.\" Tiff snapped her gum. \"That\u0027s seriously effed up.\" Bry frowned. \"Come on sib-spawn, stop elaboratin\u0027 and get your butt in the car. It\u0027s bad enough I had to suffer through that weak assembly with all the cry babies.\" She narrowed her eyes at him. \"Just a sec, briefs-in-a-bunch.\" He exhaled impatiently, stalking off to talk to some other seniors. Jade smiled at Tiff. \"I wish I had just a little,\" Jade made her index finger and thumb have a tiny little space between them, \"of your feisty attitude.\" \"No,\" the J\u0027s and I said together and Tiff whipped her head in our direction, her eyes like slits. Jonesy saved it, \"There can only be one Tiff,\" spreading his hands wide \"Damn straight, Jones,\" she said in cautious agreement. Cripes. He winked at us as she began to walk away. Randi came walking up at the same moment as Alex was backing away from a group of people and he plowed into her, spilling her pulse-reader, purse and all that girl related crap all over the place. As a bonus, she fell on her ass. Tiff noticed all this and said, \"Nice job, dimwit, creaming Randi. Could you go a step further? Maybe just sit on her and get it over with.\" Alex actually looked green. Here was this chick that he had a thing for and he had just used his two hundred and forty pounds of pure muscle to sideswipe her. Into the floor. Nice. He recovered, running over to her and tried to help her up. She glared up at him, completely intimidated-not. Perfect. He ignored her look and jerked her up by her arms and she yelped. He\u0027d grabbed her too hard and let her go immediately, misjudging his strength in the midst of his desire to right the wrong. Wow. She fell again. Jade cringed and walked over to Randi, as did Sophie and Buddy. \"What\u0027s going on?\" Buddy asked. Tiff blew a huge bubble and before she could suck it in, John popped it, splattering it all over her face, some of it trying to climb into her hair. She swiped a ton off her face, rolling the gum into itself in a sticky wad and glared at John. Who calmly looked back. \"I\u0027ve been dying to do that since forever.\" \"Good for you, jackass. Now the crap\u0027s in my hair!\" Tiff said, unhinged for once, flailing around trying to get all the gum with the rest of the gum. It was priceless. Bry laughed and knuckle bumped John. \"The things I can\u0027t do because she\u0027s my sister.\" \"That was kinda compulsive, Terran,\" Jonesy said with a smirk of pure admiration. \"I know, I\u0027m sort of shocked myself,\" he said. \"Argh! This nasty shit is everywhere, John!\" Tiff said, beyond annoyed. He grinned, high color riding his cheekbones, his hair a darkly burnished orange flame on his head. Alex smiled and Randi laughed, brushing her butt off and taking the hand that he offered. His grip swallowed hers whole and it struck me they were the most unlikely couple. He was tremendous and she was built like a China doll. Fragile and delicate, she came to maybe mid-chest. I guess perv-boy would have to catch a clue. I was thinking she was feistier than Tiff even. I looked at Tiff again. Probably not today though. The Dump \"I know I\u0027m not a longstanding member of the group,\" Archer said, looking around the inside of the hideaway, \"but I was wondering what your parents thought of the last Parker episode, Caleb?\" Jonesy opened his mouth to elaborate when Lewis said, \"Thanks for your willingness, Mark, but I am interested to hear what Caleb has to say.\" Jonesy glared at him. I still couldn\u0027t recover when he called him Mark. We had reconvened at the hideaway with a loose plan to go to Gramps\u0027. His house was huge. It wasn\u0027t lake weather but he\u0027d have the fire going and food galore. And no Nazi parent in sight. Mom had been on the warpath (I saw one of the Skopamish in my mind\u0027s eye and almost laughed). I thought my friends could use a break. We\u0027d miss her pizza but Gramps had ideas. Interesting ideas. \"He\u0027s a problem. But Parker\u0027s an untouchable problem. Garcia said that when he filed his report about the chopper chock full of zombies that he was stonewalled.\" The group looked at me weird. \"His words, guys.\" John clarified, \"He was met with resistance and a basic lack of cooperative info exchange.\" Tiff snapped her gum. \"Nice, Terran. Now, if you\u0027d just put that smartness to use with gum.\" John blushed. I thought it was too funny. The one time John had got a wild hair diggin\u0027 up his ass to be spontaneous he pulled it on Tiff. Nice. I shrugged. \"So, it\u0027s the cops\u0027 call. My parents are leaving it in their hands. Now,\" I looked at Lewis, who didn\u0027t really have the full flavor of the group, \"the first time he was gonna take me. I\u0027m not gonna lie, it sorta set the tone from that point on.\" Archer smiled. \"I would think so.\" \"Can ya talk like a teenager, Archer? Or is that part of the gay thing?\" Jonesy asked rudely. Sophie said, \"Jonesy, lay off. I think it\u0027s cool how he expresses himself.\" \"I can dumb down my sentences directed at you, Mark. Would that be equitable?\" Archer said with the ghost of a smile on his lips. John laughed. \"Need a translation, Jonesy?\" He shot a look to John I interpreted as, go die. \"No! I get what he\u0027s saying, but all that fancy talk...\" \"Well then, Mark, reiterate what I just said,\" Lewis said. And I was pretty sure this time our group may have been busting at the seams with brainiacs. Terran, Sims and now... Archer. Gayness aside, he was Smart as Hell. Mom would have said his gayness didn\u0027t define his intellect or some happy shit like that. Of course, the beauty of that was that she wasn\u0027t here. So why did her thoughts come to my mind? I shook my head. Haunted by the parental dynamic. Jonesy looked helplessly around him. Getting nowhere he huffed, crossing his arms. \"I\u0027m pretty sure. But... whatever.\" Archer smirked and Alex gave him a guy clap. \"Hey... where\u0027s Jade?\" Tiff asked, seeing how strange it was that Jade wasn\u0027t here with me. \"Mia\u0027s pickin\u0027 her up,\" I replied. It got me thinking. I looked down at my old watch and saw she was taking her time. I looked up at Bry, the lantern hissing around the conversations that were going on. \"Did ya talk to Mia?\" He nodded then frowned. \"Yeah, she said she\u0027d be here... \" he looked at his pulse, his eyes snapping up to mine. \"Thirty minutes ago.\" \"What?\" Archer asked, not understanding our immediate alarm. Jonesy smiled. \"Here\u0027s the deal, when something happens around Caleb, it could be life threatening.\" Way to break in the new guy, Jones. \"Pulse her, Caleb,\" Sophie said as a logic girl move. Communication is Key. Right! I swung my pulse up and thumb-swiped it. Initializing... The neon green characters illuminated, floating together and flashed- Hot One- Top five contact. I waited impatiently while nothing happened. I tapped my foot, itched my head, shifted my weight. The group hanging on the head of a pin. The silence became bloated. Finally. Pulse inoperative. Non-receiving. My head jerked upright and met Bry\u0027s eyes. \"Can\u0027t reach her... \" he said, dread filling his face. \"Inoperative,\" I inserted, panic clutching my body, adrenaline making surging bile rise, engaging the gorge reflex. \"Non-receiving,\" he added, his eyes holding all the weight of the world. It was a miracle that we got to Jade\u0027s house in one piece. We put maniac driving to the test. We piled out of the car and Sophie and Tiff came charging alongside us. Bry stopped Tiff with a hand on her arm, dragging her over to him before she could bash through Jade\u0027s front gate. My eyes flicked to the house, all in white. Silent. Silent as a tomb. \"No, sister,\" he shook his head. She tried to tear her arm away. \"Knock it off, Bry! That\u0027s Jade in there... and Mia,\" she added in a low voice and Bry flinched. He shook her slightly. \"You don\u0027t get it cuz you\u0027re a girl. But you\u0027re my sister. I can\u0027t let anything happen to you. Got it?\" His eyes bored into hers. \"Mom and Dad would have my butt in a sling. But more than that, you\u0027re a pain in my ass, but I love ya.\" She stopped her gum chewing, eyes wide. \"Promise me you won\u0027t do something stupid,\" he said, shaking her again for good measure. \"Okay,\" she said in a quiet voice. Wow, a miracle. John came up next to them. \"I\u0027ll keep an eye on her.\" Bry swept his eyes to Terran, taking in his lanky build and extreme height. But it was his eyes that convinced Bry. It was like Gramps said- it\u0027s not the size of the dog in the fight. It\u0027s the size of the fight in the dog. John Terran had a lot of fight. Bry knew it and nodded his head. Tiff rolled her eyes like she was having an epileptic fit. Jonesy was all ready to be on point with Sophie when Buddy showed up. Flanked by all his friends. Bry and I exchanged an uneasy glance as Diego, Brett, Carson and Brody walked up. Christi was there as the cherry on top of the misery cake. Fuck me, I moaned inside my head. \"Who invited the ass hats?\" Jonesy said, inciting them instantaneously. Sophie raised her pulse in the air and Jonesy said, \"Soph, seriously? Like things aren\u0027t stupid enough?\" She rolled her lip between her teeth, the bruise below her eye a grotesque green and violet, the swelling gone, a fine network of bloodshot lightning running through it like spider webbing. \"I wanted Buddy to come.\" Great idea, I thought miserably. I glanced at Jade\u0027s house and Bry and I nodded at each other, getting ready to infiltrate. \"This is swell for you doofuses to show, but I think Jade and Mia are in trouble... \" I began. \"Yeah, as much as we\u0027d like to parley, I think you need to piss off,\" John said and Alex grinned. Terran the Glib.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-screams-death-4/page-27.html","bookId":2492,"book":{"id":2492,"title":"Death Screams (Death #4)","description":"Storyline: Death Screams (Death #4) Caleb\u0027s second year of high school starts off without a hitch until Jade touches the wrong clairvoyance sample that foretells a murder in her future.
