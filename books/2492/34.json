It gave me a weird visual when I thought about it.\"\\n\\n \"Pink tutus?\" she asked.\\n\\n I swiveled my head toward her in surprise.\\n\\n She laughed. \"It\u0027s what I think of too when I hear the word ballet. I didn\u0027t like... peek.\"\\n\\n Good thing. She may see some images that didn\u0027t have anything to do with dancing.\\n\\n We got to the dojo and Jade got out of the car before I could open the door for her. \"Knock it off, Jade. Let me help you,\" I said, kinda pissed.\\n\\n She plugged her hands onto her hips. \"Don\u0027t be pushy, Caleb, I\u0027m not an invalid. I got beat up, it\u0027s over. He\u0027s gone. Ya don\u0027t need to baby me.\"\\n\\n We sorta glared at each other. Finally, I said, \"You don\u0027t make being your boyfriend easy sometimes, Jade.\"\\n\\n She searched my eyes. \"I know that you want to help. But I don\u0027t need this much,\" she waved her hand toward the door and at her body, \"body guarding. I just don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Give a guy a break, Jade. Any dude that wasn\u0027t a dick would want to keep ya next to him after that effin\u0027 mess. Right? You gotta feel me on your safety here,\" I said, my hands on my hips, my gaze steady on hers.\\n\\n She came closer, my anger at her stubbornness dissipating the closer she came, her hold on me that strong. Jade wrapped her hands around my forearms, my hoodie sleeves jacked up to my elbows and I realized too late that she would feel my unease.\\n\\n She gasped a little. \"You\u0027re worried.\"\\n\\n I nodded. No use hiding it now.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not just what happened.\"\\n\\n I shook my head, sighing. \"I don\u0027t know what it is. Been feeling it all week. It\u0027s like, there\u0027s something just out of reach that doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\\n\\n \"Parker,\" Jade pressed her eyes closed, searching. Searching my consciousness.\\n\\n Her eyes sprung open. \"It\u0027s that creepy attacker. The one that almost got Sophie.\"\\n\\n I shrugged. \"Maybe. If I knew, I could figure something out. Plan a defense, be prepared.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like you have a little overlap ability.\"\\n\\n It was possible. But if that was the case, I wasn\u0027t diggin\u0027 this. It was too vague to do anything with. Except maybe call in the undead troops again and get my ass in trouble for nothing. Yeah, like I needed that.\\n\\n I heard a jarring noise and sprung away from Jade, moving in front of her protectively and burst out laughing when I saw who it was.\\n\\n Bry rolled up in his hunk-o-crap car. It was a testimony to its powers of perseverance that it still ran. John, Alex, Jonesy and Tiff rolled out as Mia\u0027s toaster pulled up, Archer riding shotgun.\\n\\n Jade reached behind her and pulled on her pink puffy, it consumed her shape. She looked like a big piece of candy in the thing.\\n\\n I got a pulse-vision visual on that one. X-rated. I grinned and Bry came over and gave me a knuckle-bump. \"Whatcha ya thinkin\u0027 about, Hart.\"\\n\\n \"Stuff,\" I said. Like I\u0027d say.\\n\\n Tiff came up in a bright orange hoodie (hunter orange, Gramps would have called it) and said, \"We have to hang out through your boring practice Hart?\"\\n\\n \"No Tiff, beat it. We\u0027ll watch Hart own the mat without ya,\" Jonesy said, coming to my manhood defense.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you show us your moves, Jones?\" Tiff said, goading him.\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I don\u0027t need any of that martial arts shit. I can give a reckoning with my fists alone,\" Jonesy put up his fists like a boxer.\\n\\n \"Nah, you\u0027d shit an orangutan if you had to go toe to toe with someone.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s an orangutan?\" Alex asked, interested.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s some kind of monkey, animal-whore,\" Jonesy said, without rancor, eyes on Tiff.\\n\\n \"Really, Mark. Alex can\u0027t \u0027whore\u0027 anything if the pimping is being done by an animal,\" Archer clarified.\\n\\n That made too much sense for Jonesy to figure out and he glared at Archer. \"You... we saved your ass from a fate worse than death. Now you need to side with me on everything, it\u0027s an honor thing.\"\\n\\n Archer crossed his arms over a perfectly ironed button-down. \"No. Alex was part of the group that came to my rescue. Your brutish tactics were effective but in this instance, you\u0027re not being logical.\"\\n\\n I put up my hands, Jade\u0027s arms wrapped around me from behind to stay warm, her cold hands buried against the skin underneath my hoodie. How she was not a boiling inferno in that puffy I couldn\u0027t figure out.\\n\\n \"Orangutans aside,\" I began, immediately getting the crooked mouth, \"I\u0027m gonna be late while you guys are out here posturing.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not posturing, Hart. I don\u0027t think Jonesy\u0027s got it,\" Tiff said and I frowned at her. What was this about?\\n\\n Jonesy walked over to her. \"What\u0027s your real problem?\" his black eyes held hers. He wasn\u0027t threatening but he\u0027d gotten John\u0027s and Bry\u0027s attention.\\n\\n \"Ya know, Sophie\u0027s my friend too. And you running around, chasing every skank in the school has turned her to Buddy. You\u0027re so busy trying to show everyone how you\u0027re all that, that you missed the coolest girl there was,\" she huffed, folding her arms over her chest.\\n\\n \"Ya know, I don\u0027t care who she dates!\" Jonesy said, sounding as false as I\u0027d ever heard him.\\n\\n \"Do the self-lie tune all day and into the night. The rest of us know the truth.\" She stalked off just as Sophie and Buddy pulled up.\\n\\n Marvelous.\\n\\n Tiff had poured the fuel before the flame and right now, the edge of it was igniting.\\n\\n Sensei Anderson appeared at the front door, throwing his arms out to his sides. Crap. I looked down at my watch and realized I was already three minutes into class time.\\n\\n I brought Jade around gently by her hand, feeling how cool it was. \"You okay?\"\\n\\n She smiled and looked behind her to where Jonesy was glaring at Buddy and Sophie, Tiff smiling triumphantly.\\n\\n \"That nap is sounding good.\"\\n\\n I got it. She\u0027d leave the rest of the gang to hash it out while she slept.\\n\\n I stroked her jaw. \"K, you stay in the car and use that thermal blanket.\" As an afterthought I said, \"I\u0027ll pulse the lock.\"\\n\\n She scrunched her nose. \"Really?\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"Yeah. I won\u0027t be able to concentrate if you\u0027re out here unprotected while you sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Caleb... \" she began then looked at my face.\\n\\n Whatever she saw there must have been enough to convince her. \"Okay,\" she said reluctantly. She slipped out of my hold and turned to the car. Once she was situated it was almost comical, her pink puffy like a cloud of roundness, then on top of that the plaid thermal blanket was over that. It smelled vaguely of vanilla from all the times we\u0027d spent wrapped up in it together. I smiled one more time then closed the door, her eyes, the color of her namesake, already closing as she turned on her side.\\n\\n I depressed my thumb against the square black pad that rode above the door handle, the clicking of all the locks a satisfying sound.\\n\\n I walked past all the bickering, Buddy and the other guys with their hands in their pockets as Sophie and Tiff had words. I got that maybe Tiff had gone too far by saying what she had to Jonesy. I gave the guy nod to the troops and they followed me, relieved as hell to leave the girls to their arguing. I swung my head around one more time to look at my car. Jade was in there.\\n\\n Safe.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t, but I wouldn\u0027t know that for another five minutes or so.\\n\\n CHAPTER 25\\n\\n I walked into the dojo and was met by a silence that was absolute. I looked around for Sensei, who had just been at the doors, looking like he was pissed at my tardiness. Usually, if I was tardy, I paid on the mat. But he was nowhere.\\n\\n The dojo suddenly seemed ominous, the mirrors that reflected the friends at my back like a fun house. The feeling of infinity from all the reflections in the room swelling in a disquieting vibration, discordant and piercing.\\n\\n I turned to John. We shared a moment, Lewis and Alex standing between us. \"What\u0027s going on, Caleb?\" Alex asked, his stance stiffening.\\n\\n Lewis looked around, his eyes searching every crevice of the dojo. \"Where are all the other students?\" he asked logically.\\n\\n \"Where indeed?\" a voice said from behind us. I whirled around and there stood Skinny-Smoker of the Graysheet fame.\\n\\n Great.\\n\\n My eyes slid past his and immediately took in my car, a sleeping Jade still inside, locked and safe.\\n\\n I relaxed. Whatever these jag-ups brought I could handle if I knew where Jade was. I could sure use Sensei\u0027s help about now.\\n\\n Maybe they had taken care of him, fear coiling in my belly.\\n\\n Immediately I thought that if they\u0027d killed him, he\u0027d be hell on their asses as a zombie. I was mildly surprised at how practical I\u0027d become.\\n\\n Intensely practical.\\n\\n That made me smile and John said, \"This is not looking good, Caleb,\" as he inclined his head toward the direction of five more men as they poured out of the back of the dojo. Artillery was standing bare in their practiced hands. Not trained on us yet, but a beat away from it.\\n\\n \"Caleb... what\u0027s going on?\" Archer whispered.\\n\\n \"Graysheet action,\" John replied, strain evident on his face.\\n\\n I stared at him. \"What do they have?\"\\n\\n John didn\u0027t bother to look at me. \"Telekinetic for one... \"\\n\\n I realized that a Null in training would know what ability he was subduing. Right now, our asses were in a wringer if they had a high level Telekinetic on board.\\n\\n \"Pull the leash on your boy, Hart or we\u0027ll kill him,\" Skinny said, casually lighting up a smoke.\\n\\n His absolute lack of concern while talking about the death of a J made me want to take a flock of zombies to rip his arms off but I sat on it.\\n\\n Debating.\\n\\n \"Why are you here?\" I asked instead, stalling. Giving myself time to think.\\n\\n He smiled at me, the grin obscured by the wall of smoke. He pointed the cig at me and said, \"You\u0027re a smart boy. I want you to think about it and tell me why this is a special place for you?\"\\n\\n One heartbeat\\n\\n Two.\\n\\n Three.\\n\\n A feeling of unveiled horror washed over me in a sick adrenaline surge.\\n\\n He laughed. \"I see you are your father\u0027s son. Understand that we know you don\u0027t apply yourself at school. But your IQ scores are off the chart. You hide a fine mind behind that persona you perpetuate. But you haven\u0027t fooled us.\"\\n\\n My power unfolded like shuffling a deck of cards. The play of them throwing out a call with trembling and spiky fingers of energy. There were no dead around us. I felt an absolute absence of them.\\n\\n \"The dead. I can\u0027t feel the dead,\" I said in a low voice.\\n\\n \"See? What did I tell you, high IQ.\"\\n\\n \"Answer me,\" I said softly.\\n\\n \"We want the girl. She\u0027s a liability. You stay out of our way while we handle the security issue of her.\" The group of Graysheets swirled around him like a loose-fitting garment, all in black, lethal.\\n\\n My mind swirled. \"And Jade?\" I asked, my heart trapped in my throat.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s collateral damage. It\u0027s the Morris girl.\" He smiled a small smile, the cruelness like arsenic on his face. \"She has witnessed some things that she should not have.\" He saw my face and said, \"Don\u0027t worry, you won\u0027t be blamed, after all, what could you do?\" He grinned, his nicotine stained teeth as obscene as his expression.\\n\\n He laughed at me as he put his cigarette out in his hand, his singed flesh filling the studio with the smell of charred skin.\\n\\n I gulped. I looked quickly outside and Buddy and Jonesy were beside a collapsed Sophie, their knees bracketing her body.\\n\\n I whipped my head around, thinking furiously.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing you can do. Just leave. Let the girl go. Both of them.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll kill you if you touch her,\" I said and felt something vital clicked into place.\\n\\n Intent becoming promise. If Jade had felt me now I would surely have been a DI. I was certain.\\n\\n The kiss of his death like a taste in my tongue, a smell filling my nostrils, the fiber of my being coming alive.\\n\\n His eyes narrowed. \"I think Parker misjudged you. Misjudged you greatly.\"\\n\\n I stalked toward him before I knew I\u0027d moved. The gun rising to meet my chest. His eyes met mine, the irises yellowed. \"You could kill. I think you\u0027re more instinctual than he gave you credit for.\" He barked out a laugh and with a signal one of his drones opened a storage closet.\\n\\n I could feel the steel of the gun pressed against my hoodie, the coldness of it seeping through the layers. My eyes followed the Graysheet as the body of Sensei was revealed through bars.\\n\\n Locked bars.\\n\\n I closed my eyes for a moment, thinking about the death of my teacher.\\n\\n Then they popped open. He wasn\u0027t dead. No way. I couldn\u0027t feel his death when I\u0027d tested the area for it. But even from where I stood I could make out the frenetic movement of his eyes beneath his lids. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-screams-death-4/page-34.html","bookId":2492,"book":{"id":2492,"title":"Death Screams (Death #4)","description":"Storyline: Death Screams (Death #4) \\n Caleb\u0027s second year of high school starts off without a hitch until Jade touches the wrong clairvoyance sample that foretells a murder in her future.
