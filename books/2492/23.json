{"id":105335,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"He had him there. John looked properly chastened. \"Yes, it doesn\u0027t matter what era a male is from. As a matter of fact,\" Alex began, \"I read a study that said the sexual appetites and methods... \" \"No,\" Tiff said, snapping a bubble. When she recovered she said, \"Just... no.\" Alex frowned and shut his mouth with a snap, rolling his massive shoulders into a shrug. His gaze narrowed on her. \"This from the gnome-phobe.\" She gave a small shudder then said, \"Bite me, Sims.\" Alex smirked, giving it consideration, making Tiff frown harder and Alex\u0027s smile widen into a grin. Archer said to Jonesy, \"This is all so entertaining. All the time you guys spend on sex, while no one is actually having any?\" he said, nodding. Everyone looked at Jade and I. Hell. Jade blushed so hard I thought her skin had changed permanently to a dusky red. \"Okay,\" I said, containing my embarrassment with a supreme effort, \"the deal is what to do about Clyde? We are here in the hideaway to come to a vote. Get a plan. Me telling you guys about... \" I paused here for phrasing purposes, \"Gale\u0027s compulsion to visit Clyde is not the point.\" \"Secondary?\" John clarified. I nodded. \"That\u0027ll work.\" \"Second,\" Jonesy continued, raising a finger. Huh. Jonesy the locomotive, no brake in sight. \"He\u0027s not really dead anymore.\" Jonesy looked at us. I shook my head. \"No... I felt him, guys. He is definitely dead. Done. Lights out. Taking a dirt nap... \" I looked up at the ceiling of cars, trying to think of additional idioms from Gramps. \"Chillax, Hart, we gotcha.\" Jonesy rolled his eyes just as Sophie squeezed through the opening. \"Hi!\" she said. \"What did I miss?\" Tiff barked out a laugh and Bry put his face in his hands. \"What?\" she asked. Jonesy said, \"And three,\" he nodded to Sophie in greeting, \"Gale is AFTD but she may just be the juice old Clyde needs to stay above ground.\" Bry nodded, scrubbing his face then said, \"No more six feet under for him!\" Tiff nodded, cackling. Sophie gave a confused look to the group. \"Boy, I definitely came in too late. What\u0027s going on?\" Jonesy bit into some of the secret stash of candy, tearing half the Snicker\u0027s bar right off. Through a mouthful he said, \"Gale wants to do the nasty with Clyde.\" I slapped my forehead and John groaned. \"No!\" I said, defending Gale\u0027s honor. \"She\u0027s been going to the cemetery to spend time by his grave and, well, I don\u0027t know exactly what it\u0027s all about.\" I leveled a spiteful look at Jones. He shrugged. \"That\u0027s really weird, Caleb,\" Sophie said, a look of distaste puckering her fully glossed lips. Jonesy stuck his palm out like, see what I\u0027m sayin\u0027? \"Anyway, I think we\u0027ve gotten terribly off topic,\" John said, centering the group. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know, I like the first part. I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 we should let that romance develop,\" Jonesy said and winked at Sophie. \"Eewww!\" Sophie said. Tiff frowned. \"What\u0027s wrong about it?\" Alex smiled. Everyone blanched at her comment but she went on, unfazed, \"Okay, I know it seems gross but let\u0027s address that somehow. From what Clyde says, she recharges his battery.\" She popped off the milk crate and began to circle the area of their confined space, the ceiling cavernous, the floor space barely adequate. \"Caleb raised Clyde right?\" I nodded slowly, a dawning horror of revelation just out of reach. \"Then you jerked him out of the ground how many times after that?\" She looked a question at me. I didn\u0027t know, I\u0027d lost count. Her eyes narrowed. \"You don\u0027t even know how many now, do ya?\" I shook my head. \"And Parker said, he may never go down again. What would you think if sometime you go over there and he\u0027s not in his grave?\" I thought of Clyde the last time I\u0027d seen him. Standing on his own grave, the wind lifting his hair as the rain pelted his clothes to his skin. The body he possessed alive, the one that held ownership now, his death signature a singing tone in my brain. \"Who wants to believe Parker, raise their hand,\" Jade said. Nobody did. \"Okay,\" Tiff pegged us with her eyes. \"I\u0027ll give you that, he\u0027s a murderous dick.\" Bry barked out a laugh and she grinned, continuing, \"But he had some wisdom to sling our way.\" \"Yeah, like monkey\u0027s throwing their own shit,\" Jonesy muttered. Tiff laughed. \"Yeah.\" \"It doesn\u0027t answer the question of what to do,\" I said. The group was quiet for a second. Then Jade offered, \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s up to us. I mean, if Gale wants to ... \" Jade couldn\u0027t bring herself to say it. \"Commune,\" Alex offered with a lecherous smile and Jade gulped. \"See,\" she began, \"it\u0027s really none of our business, right? I mean, it\u0027s not against the law?\" Sophie shifted uncomfortably. \"Yet.\" She had a point. Jonesy looked at Sophie. \"They have any more idea about the attacker, Soph?\" She stared at him then said after a pause, \"No.\" \"How\u0027s realm going?\" Jade asked. She shook her head, her soft hair bouncing around with the movement. \"I\u0027m not doing so hot. Proctor\u0027s up my ass about it.\" Alex smiled and John gave him The Look. Sophie sighed. \"Not literally, ya perv.\" Jonesy pointed at Sophie and said, \"Yeah, what she said.\" Alex laughed. Archer said, \"Like I said before: obsessed about sex. And it appears that wars with ass obsession.\" \"Speak for yourself, Lewis,\" Jonesy said. \"Anyway,\" Sophie said, \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s that worried, he\u0027s Level Five so what does he care? He\u0027s all Mr. Confident because he got to Amanda before the guy could do the deed. But it was close,\" Sophie said, her hand going to her mouth, covering it entirely while her aqua eyes held water. Lots of it. Jonesy, not one to know what to do if the water fell said quickly, \"What\u0027s that schmuck boyfriend of yours doing about it?\" It shut down the almost tears episode and she glared at him. Exactly what he\u0027d been going for. \"Listen, there aren\u0027t two or three Buddy\u0027s. He is aware of it, he spends time in realm but he\u0027s only Level two.\" \"I knew that guy didn\u0027t have it,\" Jonesy said and Sophie rolled her eyes. Credit where it was due, I thought. \"Well, he\u0027s got something because if I ever go again with him, I\u0027m gonna have to bring it.\" Remembering the fight where it had been a near thing that I didn\u0027t get my ass kicked. The guys were silent, they\u0027d been there. \"Sorry Caleb,\" Sophie said. \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" I said, thinking she could have better taste. She didn\u0027t know it, but Jonesy was perfect for her. Of course, Jonesy hadn\u0027t woken up to that little fact either. \"Like I said, you can\u0027t help who you like,\" Alex shrugged. It was perfect timing because Mia came in the hideaway with that chick that had the inside scoop on Alex\u0027s perviness. Randi. I thought Alex would shrivel up and crawl up his own ass. He gulped and looked at Mia like she had brought a demon into his lair. It was almost funny but then I thought about how nervous I\u0027d been with Jade at first. Jonesy couldn\u0027t let awkwardness lie so he took one look at Alex, six-foot-four of two hundred and forty pounds of awkwardness and almost rubbed his hands together in glee. Hell. \"Well hiya Randi!\" Jonesy said. \"Wuzzup?\" Randi looked at him curiously, her almond-shaped eyes widening. \"Mia invited me.\" \"Hey Randi,\" Sophie said. She flicked back hair that was even blacker than Jade\u0027s. \"Hey Sophie!\" She seemed relieved to have another girl she knew around. Archer said, \"Let us \u0027lessers\u0027 hang, Mia. The stuck up ones can converge and pet each other like alley cats.\" Mia laughed. \"It\u0027s okay Lewis, I am totally okay with being a lowly Photographic.\" She scrunched up her nose delicately and pointed a finger at him. \"You\u0027re a...?\" \"Lock-Manipulator.\" \"Right,\" she snapped her fingers. \"I forgot, sorry.\" \"No problem,\" Archer said and suddenly she noticed his shoes. No irony that the Photographic forgot Lewis\u0027 ability. \"Wow, those are super cute,\" she said, then added, \"where\u0027d you get them?\" \"Nordstrom\u0027s,\" he said, the faintest blush covering the perfect skin of his face, the broken nose that Gramps fixed barely noticeable, the bruises- gone. Jonesy strolled over to him, touching the lantern absently, its sudden illumination startling Randi into a gasp. \"Wow,\" she breathed out. He continued looking at Archer\u0027s footwear. Then the pants, shirt and jacket. He was well put together, all his clothes coordinated and perfect. Yet, he somehow made it look natural, like he wasn\u0027t trying. Unstudied elegance. I wasn\u0027t sure if it was a gay thing or an Archer thing. Whatever, I wasn\u0027t sure it mattered, he looked like he was stylin\u0027. The girls all came over there and began oohing and ahhing over his great wardrobe and even I could tell he was loving the attention for his efforts. He had the fashion thing totally handled. Jonesy ruined his moment of glory with, \"Hate the fruit boots, man.\" Archer\u0027s perfect brows jacked down over his eyes. Mia turned to Jonesy, taking in his classic jock ensemble of jeans, tennis shoes and hoodie. \"Coming from you... I\u0027d say that\u0027s a compliment.\" \"What?\" Jonesy said, hand to his chest. \"So I don\u0027t worship clothing...\" \"Totally,\" Sophie said. \"Yeah,\" Tiff agreed. \"Shut up, Tiff. You wear the same crap I do,\" Jonesy said. \"Don\u0027t tell my sister to shut up, Jones,\" Bry said, body tense. Jonesy looked at him. \"Didn\u0027t mean anything by it, pal.\" \"I\u0027m just sayin... \" \"You tell her to shut up all the time,\" Alex said logically. \"Yeah,\" Bry admitted. Jonesy threw up his hands and Bry said sheepishly, \"I can, man. It\u0027s a sib thing.\" He shrugged. I didn\u0027t get it. Of course I was lucky enough to be an only child. \"I don\u0027t get to tell my sister to shut up,\" Jonesy mumbled. Bry nodded. \"Trust me, pal, your time will come,\" he winked. And the awkward moment was over like that. Until we heard the noises outside. My head swiveled to Jade. \"You didn\u0027t feel anything?\" I looked at the group and John looked embarrassed. My eyes narrowed on him. \"Were you tuned up?\" He shrugged. \"I didn\u0027t want any undead surprises.\" Great. Now we had company and we\u0027d all been offline. \"Can ya warn us next time before you give us a dead arm?\" I asked. \"What the hell is that?\" Archer asked and Jonesy\u0027s eyes widened as I punched him in the place where the bicep begins on the outer arm and the shoulder starts. With my knuckles. \"Damn Man!\" Jonesy wailed. \"Why the eff am I the fall guy for the demos?\" John smirked. Nice, his look said. Archer looked on with interest. \"Can you... ya know, move it?\" \"Hell no! He screwed me for the next two minutes, the prick!\" Jonesy said with characteristic drama. I laughed and Jade said, \"Caleb, I hate to say it but we need to see what\u0027s going on out there.\" \"Yeah, ya ass hat, let me take my gimp arm that I can\u0027t use anymore and see what I can defend, ya moron.\" Alex guffawed, pleased. We tumbled out of the hideaway and came face to face with Parker and his zombies. They held Gale between them and Parker had one zombie on point, his steel grip latched onto Garcia. The night was not looking up. Parker\u0027s eyes met mine. Stick a fork in me, I was about done on Parker. He was popping up all the time, cramping my style, trying to kidnap me one moment, then warning me the next. Piss. Off. Jade moved behind me and I wondered what to do in this mess. But of course, that didn\u0027t take long. In the distance I saw a figure begin to grow as it gained proximity. Moving toward us with alarming speed. It was Clyde. Handy timing. And he had rage etched on his face in hard lines. He came before Parker and met his gaze.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-screams-death-4/page-23.html","bookId":2492,"book":{"id":2492,"title":"Death Screams (Death #4)","description":"Storyline: Death Screams (Death #4) Caleb\u0027s second year of high school starts off without a hitch until Jade touches the wrong clairvoyance sample that foretells a murder in her future.
