{"id":109548,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"SHOTS RANG OUT across the arena, taking down several more armed Warriors. I realized that Dimitri and Eddie weren\u0027t alone - because neither was holding a gun. The shots were coming from the roofs of the compound buildings that surrounded the arena. Chaos broke out as the gathered spectators jumped to their feet to join in the fray. My breath caught as I realized that many of them had their own weapons too. I was shocked to notice that the fallen Warrior on the ground next to me wasn\u0027t bleeding. A small dart hung from his shoulder. The sharpshooters\u0027 \"bullets\" must have been tranquilizers. Who were they? I looked back toward the entrance and saw that a few others with the look of guardians had entered the arena and were fighting with some of the Warriors, including Chris. This provided cover for Dimitri and Eddie to free Sonya. A flash of strawberry blonde hair caught my eye near them, and I recognized Angeline\u0027s lithe figure. Dimitri efficiently cut Sonya\u0027s straps then helped lift her toward Eddie. A zealous Warrior came at them, and Angeline quickly knocked him out - as though he were a motivational speaker. Beside me, one of the masters shouted, \"Get the Alchemist girl! Hold her hostage! They\u0027ll negotiate for her!\" The Alchemist girl. Right. That would be me. In the roar of fighting, hardly anyone heard him - save one. The bleach blonde girl had managed to evade being tranquilized. She leapt toward me. My adrenaline kicked in, and I was suddenly no longer afraid. With reflexes I didn\u0027t know I had, I reached into my purse and pulled out the so-called \"potpourri.\" I ripped it open and flung it out around me, shouting a Latin incantation that translated roughly to \"see no more.\" Compared to the scrying spell, this one was astonishingly easy. It required will on my part, certainly, but most of the magic was tied into the physical components and didn\u0027t need the hours of concentration that the other one had. The power surged through me almost instantly, filling me with a thrill I hadn\u0027t expected. The girl screamed and dropped her gun, clawing at her eyes. Cries of dismay from the masters sitting by me showed they too had been affected. I\u0027d cast a blindness spell, one that would affect those near me for about thirty seconds. Some part of me knew that wielding magic was wrong, but the rest of me felt triumphant at stopping some of these trigger-happy fanatics, if only temporarily. I didn\u0027t waste any of that precious time. I jumped up from where I was sitting and ran across the arena, away from the fighting near the entrance. \"Sydney!\" I don\u0027t know how I managed to hear my name above all that noise. Glancing behind me, I saw Eddie and Angeline carrying Sonya out through the door. They paused, and a pained look crossed Eddie\u0027s face as he glanced around, assessing the situation. I could guess his thoughts. He wanted me to come with them. Most of the gathered Warriors had raced to the center of the arena, trying to stop Sonya\u0027s rescue. They outmatched me by a long shot, creating a wall between my friends and me. Even if I didn\u0027t have to actually fight anyone, it seemed impossible I\u0027d slip by unnoticed - especially since several people were still shouting about \"that Alchemist girl.\" Shaking my head adamantly, I motioned for Eddie to go on without me. Indecision warred on his face, and I hoped he wouldn\u0027t attempt to break through the throng to get to me. I pointed at the door, again urging him to go. Sonya was the incapacitated one. I would find my own way out. Not waiting to see what he\u0027d do, I turned and continued the way I\u0027d been going. There was a lot of open space for me to cover, but fewer Warriors to stop me. Several buildings ringed the arena, some with doors and windows. I moved toward them, though I had nothing to break the glass. Two of the doors had padlocks. That left two without. The first one I tried turned out to have some unseen lock and wouldn\u0027t open. Frantic, I ran to the second and heard a shout behind me. The bleach blonde girl had regained her sight and was coming after me. Desperately, I turned the doorknob. Nothing happened. Reaching into my purse, I pulled out what the Warriors had mistaken for hand sanitizer. I dumped it out, spilling acid over the metal knob. It melted before my eyes. I hoped that would kill the lock. I threw my shoulder into the door, and it gave. Then I dared a peek behind me. My pursuer was lying on the ground, another victim of the tranquilizers. I breathed a sigh of relief and pushed through the door. I\u0027d expected to enter another garage like the one I\u0027d first been taken to, but instead I found myself in some sort of residential building. The empty hallways turned this way and that, and I felt disoriented. Everyone was at the free-for-all in the arena. I passed makeshift bedrooms, filled with cots and partially unpacked suitcases and backpacks. When I noticed what looked like an office, I hesitated in the doorway. Papers covered large foldout tables inside, and I wondered if any contained useful information about the Warriors. I wanted so badly to go in and investigate. These Warriors were a mystery to the Alchemists. Who knew what intel these papers contained? What if there was information that could protect the Moroi? I hesitated for the space of a few heartbeats then reluctantly kept going. The guardians were using tranquilizers, but the Warriors had real guns - guns they wouldn\u0027t be afraid to use on me. Better to get out of here with the information I already had than not get out alive. I reached the far side of the building at last and peered out a bedroom window. It was so dark outside now that I could hardly see anything. I didn\u0027t have the benefit of torches anymore. The only thing I could tell for sure was that I was no longer adjacent to the arena. That was good enough for me, though it would\u0027ve been better if there was a door leading outside. I\u0027d have to make my own. Grabbing a chair, I swung it into the window and was completely astonished when the glass broke easily. A few shards hit me, but nothing large enough to cause injury. Standing on the chair, I managed to climb out the window without injuring my hands. I was met by a warm, dark night. No electric lights were visible ahead, just open black land. I took this to mean I was on the opposite side of the compound where Trey had brought me. There were no roads, no sound from the highway we had traveled. There was also no sign of life anywhere, which I took as a good sign. Hopefully all the Warrior guards who normally paroled the grounds were off fighting guardians. If Sonya was out now, my hope was that the guardians would begin retreating - and grab me along the way. Even if they didn\u0027t, I wasn\u0027t above walking back to I-10 and hitchhiking. The compound was sprawling and confusing, and as I walked around it and still saw no sign of the highway, I began to grow uneasy. How turned around had I gotten? I only had a limited amount of time to get off Warrior property. They could be hunting me right now. There was also the disconcerting problem that once I made it to the periphery, I\u0027d have to deal with the electric fence. Still, it might be best to forget looking for the freeway and simply make for the edge of the Warriors\u0027 camp so that I could - A hand grabbed my shoulder, and I screamed. \"Easy there, Sage. I\u0027m no gun-toting crazy guy. Crazy, yes. But not the rest.\" I stared in disbelief, not that I could really make out much of the tall, dark figure standing over me. \"Adrian?\" The height was right, as was the build. As I stared, I became more and more certain. His hands steadied my shaking. I was so glad to see a friendly face - to see him - that I nearly sank into his arms in relief. \"It is you. How\u0027d you find me?\" \"You\u0027re the only human out here with a yellow and purple aura,\" he said. \"Makes you easy to spot.\" \"No, I mean, how\u0027d you find me here? At the compound?\" \"I followed the others. They told me not to, but... well.\" In the faint moonlight I could barely see his shrug. \"I don\u0027t follow directions well. When Castile came out with Sonya and started babbling about how you\u0027d gone out some random door, I thought I\u0027d take a quick walk around. I don\u0027t think I was supposed to do that either, but the guardians were kind of busy.\" \"You are crazy,\" I snapped, despite how happy I was to know I hadn\u0027t been abandoned in this miserable place. \"The Warriors are so mad that they\u0027d probably kill a Moroi on sight if they saw you.\" He tugged my hand forward. Even through his banter, there\u0027d been a hard tone to his words. He was fully aware of the danger we faced. \"Then we\u0027d better get out of here.\" Adrian led me back in the direction I\u0027d come, then went around the opposite side of the building. I didn\u0027t see the freeway lights yet, but he soon turned and began running toward the property\u0027s far edge, away from the building. I ran alongside him, still holding his hand. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. \"The guardians assembled near the back side of the compound, so they wouldn\u0027t be spotted. That part of the fence has been deactivated - if you can climb it.\" \"Of course I can climb it. I\u0027m practically a prodigy in PE,\" I pointed out. \"The question is, can you, Mr. Smoker?\" The fence began to come into focus as we approached, mostly because its shape blocked some of the stars. \"That\u0027s the section. Behind the scraggly bush,\" Adrian said. I couldn\u0027t see any bush but trusted in his eyes. \"Go a little ways past that, and there\u0027s this country highway that the guardians used as a staging point. I\u0027m parked there.\" We came to a halt in front of the fence, both of us a little breathless. I peered upward. \"You\u0027re sure it\u0027s still off?\" \"It was when we came in,\" said Adrian, but I could hear a little uncertainty in his voice. \"You think those guys would have gotten their act together enough to fix it already?\" \"No,\" I admitted. \"But I\u0027d still like to know for sure. I mean, most commercial electric fences won\u0027t significantly hurt someone, but we should know.\" He glanced around. \"Can we throw a stick at it?\" \"Wood doesn\u0027t conduct.\" I rifled through my purse and found what I wanted: a metal pen with a foam grip. \"Hopefully, the foam on this will block the worst of it if the fence really is hot.\" Trying not to grimace, I reached out and touched the pen\u0027s barrel to the fence, half-expecting some intense charge to send me flying backward. Nothing happened. I slowly ran the pen along the fence, since most electric ones had an intermittent pulse. Sustained contact would be needed. \"Looks clean,\" I said, exhaling in relief and turning to Adrian. \"I guess we\u0027re good to - ahh!\" A bright light shone in my eyes, blinding me and killing whatever night vision I\u0027d gained out here. I heard Adrian cry out in surprise as well. \"It\u0027s the girl!\" a male voice exclaimed. \"And... and one of them!\" The flashlight was moved out of my face, and although spots still danced in my vision, I could make out two hulking figures rapidly approaching. Were they armed? My mind raced. Whether they were or not, they were still an obvious threat since Warriors apparently liked to practice bashing each other in their free time, and Adrian and I didn\u0027t. \"Don\u0027t move,\" said one of them. A blade shone in the gleam of the lowered flashlight. Not as bad as a gun, but not great either. \"You\u0027re both coming with us, back inside.\" \"Slowly,\" added the other. \"Don\u0027t try any tricks.\" Unfortunately for them, I still had a few up my sleeve. Quickly I put the pen back in my purse and grabbed another souvenir from Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s homework: a thin, round wooden bracelet. Before either Warrior could do anything, I snapped the wooden circle into four pieces and tossed them on the ground, calling out another Latin incantation. Again, I felt the rush of power and its exultation. The men cried out - I\u0027d cast a disorientation spell, one that messed with equilibrium and made vision blurry and surreal. It worked a lot like the blindness spell, affecting those around me. I lunged forward and pushed one of our assailants down. He fell easily, too incapacitated by the spell to resist. The other guy was so distraught that he\u0027d dropped the flashlight and was practically on the ground already as his attempts at balance failed. Nonetheless, I gave him a good kick to the chest to make sure he stayed down and grabbed his flashlight in the process. I didn\u0027t necessarily need it with Adrian\u0027s night vision, but these two would now be helpless in the dark when the spell wore off. \"Sage! What the hell did you do to me?\" Turning, I saw Adrian clinging to the fence, using it to hold himself up. In my eagerness to stop the Warriors, I\u0027d forgotten the spell affected everyone near me. \"Oh,\" I said. \"Sorry.\" \"Sorry? My legs don\u0027t work!\" \"It\u0027s your inner ear, actually. Come on. Grab the fence and climb. One hand in front of the other.\" I caught hold as well and urged him up. It wasn\u0027t the most difficult fence to climb - it wasn\u0027t electrified or barbed - and having it for support negated some of Adrian\u0027s disorientation. Nonetheless, it was still slow going as we made it toward the top. This spell lasted a little longer than the blindness one, but I was painfully aware that as soon as Adrian was free from it, the Warriors would be too. Against all odds, we made it to the top of the fence. Getting over to the other side was much more difficult, and I had to do a fair amount of acrobatics to help Adrian make the transition while keeping myself steady. Finally, I wrangled him into the correct position to climb down. \"Good,\" I said. \"Now just reverse what you did before, one hand down in front of the - \" Something slipped, either his hand or foot, and Adrian plummeted to the ground. It wasn\u0027t that long of a drop, and his height helped a little - not that he was in any shape to actually use his legs and land on his feet. I winced. \"Or you can just take the short way down,\" I said. I quickly scaled down after him and helped him stand. Aside from the spell\u0027s debilitation, he didn\u0027t seem to have suffered any damage. Slipping an arm around him and letting him lean his weight on me, I attempted to run toward the road he\u0027d mentioned, which was now slightly visible. \"Running\" was difficult, however. It was hard work keeping Adrian up and I kept stumbling. Still, we made our way slowly from the compound, which was about as much as we could hope for. Adrian\u0027s state made him clumsy and heavy, and his height was a real inconvenience. Then, without warning, the spell wore off, and Adrian instantly recovered. His legs strengthened and his unwieldy gait straightened out. Suddenly, it was as though he were carrying me, and we practically tripped over each other trying to adjust. \"You okay?\" I asked, letting go. \"I am now. What the hell was that?\" \"It\u0027s not important. What is important is that those guys have recovered too. Maybe I knocked them down hard enough to slow them down.\" That seemed kind of unlikely. \"But run anyway.\" We ran, and even if he undoubtedly had the respiratory system of a chain smoker, his long legs made up for it. He could easily outdistance me but slowed so that we stayed together. Whenever he started to get ahead, he\u0027d grab my hand again. Shouts sounded behind us, and I turned off the flashlight to make us harder to spot. \"There,\" said Adrian. \"See the cars?\" Slowly, out of the darkness, two SUVs materialized, along with a much more conspicuous yellow Mustang. \"Very covert,\" I muttered. \"Most of the guardians have gotten away,\" said Adrian. \"But not everyone.\" Before I could respond, someone grabbed me from behind. In a maneuver that would have made Wolfe proud, I managed the backward kick that he\u0027d tried so hard to teach us. It caught my attacker by surprise, and he released me, only for his companion to shove me to the ground. Three figures ran toward us from the cars and hurled themselves at our attackers. Thanks to his signature duster, I knew Dimitri led the group. \"Get out of here,\" he called to Adrian and me. \"You know where to meet. We\u0027ll cover you. Drive fast - they\u0027ll probably be on the road soon.\" Adrian helped me up, and once again we ran together. I\u0027d hurt my ankle in the fall, so I moved slowly, but Adrian helped me along and let me lean on him. All the while, my heart was threatening to pound out of my chest, even when we reached the safety of the Mustang. He guided me to the passenger side. \"Can you get in okay?\" \"I\u0027m fine,\" I said, sliding in and unwilling to admit the pain was growing. I prayed I hadn\u0027t slowed us too much. I couldn\u0027t stand the thought of being the one responsible for Adrian\u0027s capture. Satisfied, Adrian raced over to the driver\u0027s side and started the car. The engine roared to life, and he followed Dimitri\u0027s orders to the letter, peeling out at a speed I was envious of. Out on this country highway, however, it seemed unlikely there were any cops. I glanced behind us a few times, but by the time we made it to I-10, it was obvious no one had followed us. I sighed gratefully and leaned my head against the seat, though I was still a long way from being calm. I couldn\u0027t assume we were safe yet. \"Okay,\" I said. \"How on earth did you guys find me?\" Adrian didn\u0027t answer right away. When he did, I could tell it was with great reluctance. \"Eddie put a tracking device in your purse, back at my place.\" \"What? He couldn\u0027t have! They searched me.\" \"Well, I\u0027m sure it didn\u0027t look like one. I don\u0027t know what he ended up getting. He got it from your people, actually. As soon as Trey confirmed the meeting tonight, Belikov was on the phone with every guardian in a two-hour radius, trying to recruit backup. He called the Alchemists too and convinced them to share some tech.\" There were so many crazy things about what he\u0027d just said, I didn\u0027t know where to begin parsing it. All sorts of wheeling and dealing had gone on without me realizing it. And even when it had been settled, no one had told me about it. Plus, the Alchemists had been involved? Helping the guardians to track me? \"The earrings,\" I said. \"That\u0027s where they came from. The tracker must be in one of them. I never would have guessed.\" \"I\u0027m not surprised, knowing the way you guys work.\" The rest of tonight\u0027s reality began to sink in. The last of my fear subsided - only to be replaced by anger. \"You lied to me! All of you! You should have told me what you were doing - that you were tracking me and planning a raid! How could you keep that from me?\" He sighed. \"I didn\u0027t want to, believe me. I told them over and over they needed to get you in the loop. But everyone was afraid you\u0027d refuse to take the device if you knew about it. Or that you\u0027d somehow slip up and give away the plan to those nuts. I didn\u0027t believe that, though.\" \"And yet, you didn\u0027t bother telling me yourself,\" I snapped, still outraged. \"I couldn\u0027t! They made me promise not to.\" Somehow, his betrayal hurt worse than all the others. I had come to trust him implicitly. How could he do this to me? \"No one believed I\u0027d be able to talk the Warriors down, so everyone just made contingency plans without me.\" Never mind that I hadn\u0027t been able to talk them down. \"Someone should have told me. You should have told me.\" There was legitimate pain and regret in his voice. \"I\u0027m telling you, I wanted to. But I was trapped. You of all people should know what it\u0027s like being caught between groups, Sage. Besides, don\u0027t you remember what I said just before you got in the car with Trey?\" I did, actually. Almost word for word. No matter what happens, I want you to know that I never doubted what you\u0027re going to do. It\u0027s smart, and it\u0027s brave. I slouched further into my seat and felt like I was on the verge of tears. Adrian was right. I did know what it was like to have your loyalty stretched between different groups. I understood the position he\u0027d been in. It was just, some selfish part of me wished that I\u0027d been the one his loyalty had been strongest to. He tried, an inner voice said. He tried to tell you. The meeting spot that Dimitri had told Adrian to go to turned out to be Clarence\u0027s house. The place was crawling with guardians, some of whom were patching up each other\u0027s injuries. No one had been killed on either side, something the guardians had been very cautious about. The Warriors of Light already thought vampires were twisted and corrupt. They didn\u0027t need more fuel added to the fire. Not that tonight\u0027s raid was probably going to help matters. I had no clue how the Warriors would react or if there might be some lethal retaliation in store. I supposed the guardians and Alchemists had taken that into consideration. I wondered bitterly if any of them would share their opinions on it with me. \"I know better than to offer to heal you,\" Adrian told me, as we squeezed past a group of guardians. \"Grab a seat in the living room, and I\u0027ll get you some ice.\" I started to say I could get my own, but my ankle was growing increasingly painful. With a nod, I left him and made my way to the living room. A couple of unknown guardians were there, along with a beaming Clarence. To my surprise, Eddie and Angeline were also in there, sitting side by side - and holding hands? \"Sydney!\" he exclaimed. He immediately released Angeline\u0027s hand and hurried over to me, astonishing me with a hug. \"Thank God you\u0027re okay. I hated having to leave you there. That wasn\u0027t part of the plan. I was supposed to have gotten you out with Sonya.\" \"Yeah, well, maybe next time, someone can fill me in on the plan,\" I said pointedly. Eddie grimaced. \"I\u0027m sorry about that. I really am. We just...\" \"I know, I know. Didn\u0027t think I\u0027d go along with it, were afraid something would go wrong, etc., etc.\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" I didn\u0027t entirely forgive him, but I was too tired to push the matter much further. \"Just tell me this,\" I said, lowering my voice. \"Were you just holding hands with Angeline?\" He blushed, which seemed ludicrous after the fierceness I\u0027d seen him pull off back at the compound. \"Er, yeah. We were just... talking. I mean, that is... I think we might go out sometime. Not at school, of course, since everyone thinks we\u0027re related. And probably not anything serious. I mean, she\u0027s still a little out there, but she\u0027s not as bad as I used to think. And she was really great in that battle. I feel like maybe I should get my head out of the fantasy with Jill and try some normal dating. If you\u0027ll let me borrow your car.\" I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. \"Sure,\" I said. \"Far be it for me to stop a budding romance.\" Should I tell him Jill might not be such a fantasy after all? I didn\u0027t want to meddle. Eddie deserved to be happy, but I couldn\u0027t help but feel a little bad that I\u0027d told Jill he might be interested. I hope I hadn\u0027t made things more complicated. Adrian returned with a bag of ice. I sat down in an armchair, and he helped position the ice on my ankle after I propped it up on a footstool. I relaxed as the ice began numbing the pain and hoped I hadn\u0027t broken anything. \"Isn\u0027t this exciting?\" Clarence asked me. \"Finally, you were able to see the vampire hunters for yourselves!\" I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d describe the night with that much enthusiasm, but I did have to concede a point to him. \"You were right,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sorry for not believing you sooner.\" He gave me a kind smile. \"It\u0027s all right, my dear. I probably wouldn\u0027t have believed a crazy old man either.\" I smiled in return and then thought of something from earlier. \"Mr. Donahue... you said when you encountered the hunters before that a human named Marcus Finch intervened on your behalf.\" Clarence nodded eagerly. \"Yes, yes. Nice young man, that Marcus. Certainly hope I run into him again someday.\" \"Was he an Alchemist?\" I asked. Seeing Clarence\u0027s puzzled look, I tapped my cheek. \"Did he have a tattoo like mine?\" \"Like yours? No, no. It was different. Hard to explain.\" I leaned forward. \"But he did have a tattoo on his cheek?\" \"Yes. Didn\u0027t you see in the picture?\" \"What picture?\" Clarence\u0027s gaze turned inward. \"I could\u0027ve sworn I showed you some of my old pictures, back when Lee and Tamara were young... ah, such good days those were.\" I worked hard to stay patient. Clarence\u0027s moments of coherence were sometimes hard to get a hold of. \"And Marcus? You have a picture of him too?\" \"Of course. A lovely one of the two of us. I\u0027ll find it one day and show you.\" I wanted to ask him if he\u0027d show it to me now, but with his place so crowded, it didn\u0027t seem like the right time. Dimitri arrived shortly thereafter, along with the last of the guardians who\u0027d been at the compound. Dimitri immediately asked about Sonya, who I\u0027d learned was resting in her bedroom. Adrian had offered to heal her, but Sonya had had enough clarity of mind to refuse him, saying she simply wanted blood and rest and a chance for the drugs to wear off naturally. Once Dimitri got this report and could rest easy about Sonya, he came straight to me, looking down from his lofty height at where I sat with my ice. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I know you must have heard by now what happened.\" \"That I was sent into a dangerous situation with only half the information I needed?\" I asked. \"Yeah, I heard all about that.\" \"I\u0027m not a fan of lies and half truths,\" he said. \"I wished there\u0027d been another way. We had so little time, and this just seemed like the best option. No one doubted your ability to reason and make a compelling case. It was the Warriors\u0027 ability to listen and see reason that we didn\u0027t believe in.\" \"I can see why you guys didn\u0027t trust me with the plan.\" Near me, I saw Adrian flinch at the way I said \"you guys.\" I hadn\u0027t intentionally meant anything by it but realized now that it sounded very condescending and Alchemist - so Us versus Them. \"But I still can\u0027t believe the Alchemists went along with that - that they condoned keeping me out of the loop.\" There were no free chairs left, so Dimitri simply sat down cross-legged. \"There\u0027s not much I can tell you about that. Like I said, it was all short notice, and when I spoke with Donna Stanton, she felt it would be safer all around if you didn\u0027t know what was coming. If it makes you feel better, she was very adamant about us keeping you safe once we were there.\" \"Maybe,\" I said. \"It\u0027d be better still if she\u0027d thought about how I might feel when I found out I wasn\u0027t trusted with vital information.\" \"She did think about it,\" said Dimitri, looking slightly uncomfortable. \"She said you wouldn\u0027t mind because you understand the importance of not questioning your superiors\u0027 decisions and that you know what they do is for the best. She said you\u0027re an exemplary Alchemist.\" Don\u0027t question. They know what\u0027s best. We can\u0027t take any chances. \"Of course she did,\" I said. I never question anything.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-golden-lily-bloodlines-2/page-22.html","bookId":2042,"book":{"id":2042,"title":"The Golden Lily (Bloodlines #2)","description":"Storyline: The book follows Sydney Sage, a young Alchemist that is forced to hide inside a ritzy boarding school in Palm Springs, California so that she can protect Jill Dragomir, a Moroi princess.
