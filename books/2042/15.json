{"id":109541,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"I FELT SO BAD for Brayden the next day that I actually called him, as opposed to our usual texting and e-mailing. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I said. \"Running out like that... it\u0027s not my usual style. Not at all. I wouldn\u0027t have left if it wasn\u0027t a family emergency.\" Maybe that was stretching it. Maybe not. \"It\u0027s okay,\" he said. Without seeing his face, I couldn\u0027t tell if it really was okay. \"I suppose things were winding down anyway.\" I wondered what \"things\" he meant. Did he mean the dance itself? Or was he talking about us? \"Let me take you out to make up for it,\" I said. \"You always do everything. I\u0027ll handle it for a change. Dinner will be on me, and I\u0027ll even pick you up.\" \"In the Subaru?\" I ignored the judgment in his tone. \"Are you in or not?\" He was in. We made the necessary arrangements, and I hung up feeling better about everything. Brayden wasn\u0027t mad. Adrian\u0027s visit hadn\u0027t ruined my fledgling relationship. Things were back to normal - at least for me. I\u0027d kept to myself the day after the dance, wanting to catch up on work and not stress about social matters. Monday morning started the school week again, back to business as usual. Eddie walked into East\u0027s cafeteria when I did, and we waited together in the food line. He wanted to know about Adrian\u0027s visit to the dance, and I gave a glossed-over version of the night, simply saying that Adrian had gotten drunk and needed a ride home. I made no mention of my role in getting the queen to act on his behalf or of me being \"the most beautiful creature walking this earth.\" I certainly didn\u0027t mention the way I\u0027d felt when Adrian had touched me. Eddie and I walked over to a table and found the unusual sight of Angeline trying to cheer up Jill. Normally, I would\u0027ve chastised Angeline for what she\u0027d done at the dance, but there\u0027d been no damage done... this time. Plus, I was too distracted by Jill. It was impossible for me to see her down without immediately assuming something was wrong with Adrian. Eddie spoke before I could, noticing what I hadn\u0027t. \"No Micah?\" he asked. \"He was out the door before me. I figured he would\u0027ve beat me over here.\" \"You had to ask, didn\u0027t you?\" Angeline grimaced. \"They had a fight.\" I swear, Eddie looked more upset about this than Jill. \"What? He didn\u0027t say anything. What happened? You guys seemed to be having such a great time on Saturday.\" Jill nodded morosely but didn\u0027t look up from her uneaten food. I could just barely catch sight of tears in her eyes. \"We did. So good that he actually talked to me yesterday and asked... well, he asked if I wanted to have Thanksgiving with his family. They\u0027re from Pasadena. He thought he could either get permission from the school or talk to you guys.\" \"That doesn\u0027t sound so bad,\" said Eddie cautiously. \"Thanksgiving with his family is serious! It\u0027s one thing for us to hang out together here, but if we start expanding that... becoming a couple outside of school...\" She sighed. \"It\u0027s going to go too fast. How long would I be able to hide what I am? And even if that wasn\u0027t an issue, it\u0027s not safe anyway. The whole point of me being here is that it\u0027s a safe, controlled environment. I can\u0027t just take off to meet strangers.\" It was another step of progress to her accepting the difficulties of a \"casual\" relationship with Micah. I offered a neutral comment. \"Sounds like you\u0027ve thought a lot about this.\" Jill looked up sharply, almost as if she hadn\u0027t even realized I was there. \"Yeah. I guess I have.\" She scrutinized me for a few seconds, and weirdly, her distraught expression softened. She smiled. \"You look really pretty today, Sydney. The way the light hits you... it\u0027s kind of amazing.\" \"Um, thanks,\" I said, uncertain as to what had prompted that comment. I was pretty sure there was nothing remarkable about me today. My hair and makeup were the same as ever, and I\u0027d chosen a white shirt and plaid skirt uniform combo today. I had to make up for this weekend\u0027s color splurge. \"And the burgundy trim in your skirt really brings out the amber in your eyes,\" Jill continued. \"It\u0027s not as good as the bright red, but still looks great. Of course, every color looks great on you, even the dull ones.\" Eddie was still focused on Micah. \"How\u0027d the fight come about?\" Jill dragged her gaze from me, much to my relief. \"Oh. Well. I told him I didn\u0027t know if I could do Thanksgiving. Probably if I\u0027d just given him one reason, it would\u0027ve all been fine. But I started freaking out, thinking about all the problems, and just went off on a ramble, saying we might go back to South Dakota or maybe family would come here or maybe you wouldn\u0027t let me... or, well, a bunch of other things. I guess it was pretty obvious I was kind of making it all up, and then he outright asked me if I didn\u0027t want to be with him anymore. Then I said I did but that it was complicated. He asked what I meant, but of course I couldn\u0027t explain it all, and from there...\" She threw up her hands. \"It all just kind of exploded from there.\" I\u0027d never thought much about Thanksgiving or meeting one\u0027s family as a rite of passage in dating. Brayden\u0027s family lived in southern California too... would I be expected to meet them someday? \"Micah\u0027s not the type to hold a grudge,\" said Eddie. \"He\u0027s also pretty reasonable. Just tell him the truth.\" \"What, that I\u0027m one of the last in a line of vampire royalty and my sister\u0027s throne is dependent on me staying in hiding and surviving?\" Jill asked incredulously. Amusement flickered in Eddie\u0027s eyes, though I could tell he was trying to stay serious for her sake. \"That\u0027s one way, I suppose. But no... I meant, just give him the simplified version. You don\u0027t want to get too serious. You like him but just want to watch how fast things are going. It\u0027s not unreasonable, you know. You\u0027re fifteen and have been \u0027dating\u0027 for barely a month.\" She pondered his words. \"You don\u0027t think he\u0027d be mad?\" \"Not if he really cares about you,\" said Eddie vehemently. \"If he really cares, he\u0027ll understand and respect your wishes - and be happy at just any chance of spending time with you.\" I wondered if Eddie was referring to Micah or himself, but that was a thought best kept quiet. Jill\u0027s face lit up. \"Thanks,\" she told Eddie. \"I hadn\u0027t thought of it that way. You\u0027re so right. If he can\u0027t accept my feelings, then there\u0027s no point to anything.\" She glanced over at a wall clock and jumped to her feet. \"I think I\u0027m going to go try to find him now before class.\" Like that, she was gone. Good work, Eddie, I thought. You may have just helped get the girl of your dreams back together with her boyfriend. When Eddie caught my eye, the look on his face told me he was thinking the exact same thing. Angeline watched Jill dart out of the cafeteria, her blue eyes narrowed in thought. \"Even if they make up, I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll last. With their situation... it can\u0027t work.\" \"I thought you were all about vampire and human relationships,\" I said. \"Oh, sure. Back home, no problem. Even out in your world, no problem. But Jill\u0027s a special case. She\u0027s got to stay out of sight and stay safe if she\u0027s going to help her family. Dating him won\u0027t do that, and she knows it - no matter how much she wishes it weren\u0027t true. She\u0027ll do the right thing in the end. This is duty. It\u0027s bigger than personal wants. Jill gets that.\" Angeline then declared she needed to get back to her room to catch up on homework. Eddie and I were left staring. He shook his head in amazement. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen Angeline so...\" \"... subdued?\" I suggested. \"I was thinking... coherent.\" I laughed. \"Come on, she\u0027s coherent plenty of times.\" \"You know what I mean,\" he argued. \"What she just said? It was totally true. It was... wise. She understands Jill and this situation.\" \"I think she understands more than we give her credit for,\" I said, recalling how much better-behaved she\u0027d been since the assembly - breaking into dances aside. \"It\u0027s just taken her time to adjust, which makes sense, considering what a change this is. If you\u0027d seen where she\u0027s from, you\u0027d understand.\" \"I may have misjudged her,\" Eddie admitted. He seemed astonished by his own words. Part of me had expected to get chastised by Trey today for having skipped out on Brayden at the dance. Instead, I found Trey missing again from our morning classes. I almost worried but then reminded myself that his cousin was still in town, possibly muddling Trey in \"family stuff.\" Trey was competent. Whatever was going on, he could handle it. Then why all the bruises? I wondered. When I reached Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s independent study, she was waiting expectantly for me, which I took as a bad sign. Usually, she was already hard at work at her own desk and just gave me a nod of acknowledgment when I took out my books. Today, she was standing in front of her desk, arms crossed, watching the door. \"Miss Melbourne. I trust you had an enjoyable weekend? You were certainly the belle of the ball at the Halloween dance.\" \"You saw me?\" I asked. For a moment, I expected her to say she\u0027d been watching the whole dance through a crystal ball or something. \"Well, certainly. I was there as a chaperone. My post was near the DJ, so I\u0027m not surprised you didn\u0027t see me. That, and I hardly stood out the way you did. I must say, that was an exquisite neo-Greco reproduction you were wearing.\" \"Thanks.\" I was getting compliments left and right today, but hers were much less creepy than Jill\u0027s. \"Now then,\" said Ms. Terwilliger, all business again. \"I thought it might be useful for us to discuss some of the spells you\u0027ve been researching for my project. Notating them is one thing. Understanding them is another.\" My stomach sank. I\u0027d grown comfortable in my avoidance of her and the repetitive, almost mindless nature of annotating and translating spells. So long as we didn\u0027t have to actually delve into them, I felt reassured that I wasn\u0027t doing anything real with magic. I dreaded whatever she had in mind, but there was little I could make in the way of protest, so long as this was all couched in the terms of my study and didn\u0027t involve harm to myself or others. \"Would you be kind enough to close the door?\" she asked. I did, and my feeling of unease increased. \"Now. I wanted to examine that book I gave you further - the one on protective spells.\" \"I don\u0027t have it with me, ma\u0027am,\" I said, relieved. \"But if you want, I\u0027ll go get it from my dorm room and bring it back.\" If I timed the shuttle bus right - by which I meant, wrong - I could probably use up a huge part of our hour in the round-trip. \"That\u0027s all right. I obtained that copy for your personal use.\" She lifted a book from her desk. \"I have my own. Let\u0027s take a look, shall we?\" I couldn\u0027t hide my dismay. We sat in adjacent student desks, and she began by simply going over the table of contents with me. The book was divided into three sections: Defense, Planned Attacks, and Instant Attacks. Each of those subsections was divided into levels of difficulty. \"Defense includes a lot of protective charms and evasion spells,\" she told me. \"Why do you think those come first in the book?\" \"Because the best way to win a fight is to avoid one,\" I said immediately. \"Makes the rest superfluous.\" She looked startled that I had come up with that. \"Yes... precisely.\" \"That\u0027s what Wolfe said,\" I explained. \"He\u0027s the instructor in a self-defense class I\u0027m taking.\" \"Well, he\u0027s quite right. Most of the spells in this section do exactly that. This one...\" She flipped a few pages into the book. \"This one\u0027s very basic but extremely useful. It\u0027s a concealment spell. Many physical components - which you\u0027d expect from a beginner spell - but well worth it. You create an amulet and keep a separate ingredient - crumbled gypsum - on hand. When you\u0027re ready to activate it, add the gypsum, and the amulet comes to life. It makes it nearly impossible for someone to see you. You can leave a room or area in safety, undetected, before the magic wears off.\" The wording wasn\u0027t lost on me, and in spite of my inner resistance, I couldn\u0027t help but ask: \"\u0027Nearly impossible?\u0027\" \"It won\u0027t work if they actually know you\u0027re there,\" she explained. \"You can\u0027t just cast it and become invisible - though there are more advanced spells for that. But if someone isn\u0027t actively expecting to see you... well, they won\u0027t.\" She showed me others, many of which were basic and amulet based, requiring a similar means of activation. One that she dubbed intermediate had kind of a reverse activation process. The caster wore an amulet that protected her when she cast the rest of the spell - one that made all people within a certain radius go temporarily blind. Only the caster retained sight. Listening, I still squirmed at the thought of using magic to directly affect someone else. Concealing yourself was one thing. But blinding someone? Making them dizzy? Forcing them to sleep? It crossed that line, using wrong and unnatural means to do things humans had no business doing. And yet... deep inside, some part of me could see the usefulness. The attack had made me reconsider all sorts of things. As much as it pained me to admit it, I could even see how giving blood to Sonya might not be so bad. Might. I wasn\u0027t ready to do it yet by any means. I listened patiently as she went through the pages, all the while wondering what her game was here. Finally, when we had five minutes left of class, she told me, \"For next Monday, I\u0027d like you to re-create one of these, just as you did with the fire amulet and write a paper on it.\" \"Ms. Terwilliger - \" I began. \"Yes, yes,\" she said, closing the book and standing up. \"I\u0027m well aware of your arguments and objections, how humans aren\u0027t meant to wield such power and all of that nonsense. I respect your right to feel that way. No one\u0027s making you use any of this. I just want you to continue getting a feel for the construction.\" \"I can\u0027t,\" I said adamantly. \"I won\u0027t.\" \"It\u0027s no different than dissecting a frog in biology,\" she argued. \"Hands-on work to understand the material.\" \"I guess...\" I relented, glumly. \"Which one do you want me to do, ma\u0027am?\" \"Whichever you like.\" Something about that bothered me even more. \"I\u0027d rather you choose.\" \"Don\u0027t be silly,\" she said. \"You have freedom in your larger term paper and freedom in this. I don\u0027t care what you do, so long as the assignment\u0027s complete. Go with what interests you.\" And that was the problem. In having me choose, she was making me get invested in the magic. It was easy for me to claim no part in it and point out that everything I did for her was under duress. Even if this assignment was technically dictated by her, that one small choice she\u0027d given me forced me to become proactive. So, I put the decision off - which was almost unheard of for me when it came to homework. Some part of me thought that maybe if I ignored the assignment, it would go away or she\u0027d change her mind. Besides, I had a week. No point in stressing about it yet. Although I knew we had no obligation to Lia for giving us the costumes, I still felt the appropriate thing to do was return them to her - just so there was no doubt of my intentions. Once Ms. Terwilliger released me, I packed up my and Jill\u0027s costumes into their garment bags and headed into downtown. Jill was sad to let hers go but conceded that it was the right thing to do. Lia, however, felt otherwise. \"What am I going to do with these?\" she asked when I showed up at her shop. Large rhinestone hoop earrings made her dazzling to look at. \"They were custom made for you.\" \"I\u0027m sure you can alter them. And I\u0027m sure they\u0027re not far off from your sample sizes anyway.\" I held the hangers out, and she obstinately crossed her arms. \"Look, they were great. We really appreciate what you did. But we can\u0027t keep them.\" \"You will keep them,\" she stated. \"If you don\u0027t take them, I\u0027ll just leave them on your counter,\" I warned. \"And I\u0027ll have them shipped back to your dorm.\" I groaned. \"Why is this so important to you? Why can\u0027t you take no for an answer? There are plenty of pretty girls in Palm Springs. You don\u0027t need Jill.\" \"That\u0027s exactly it,\" said Lia. \"Plenty of pretty girls that all blend into each other. Jill is special. She\u0027s a natural and doesn\u0027t even know it. She could be great someday.\" \"Someday,\" I repeated. \"But not right now.\" Lia attempted another approach. \"The campaign is for scarves and hats. I can\u0027t do masks again, but I can put her in sunglasses - especially if we shoot outside. Tell me if you\u0027d agree to this plan - \" \"Lia, please. Don\u0027t bother.\" \"Just listen,\" she urged. \"We\u0027ll go do a photo shoot. Afterward, you can go through all the pictures and throw out any that don\u0027t meet your weird religious criteria.\" \"No exceptions,\" I insisted. \"And I\u0027m leaving the dresses.\" I set them on a counter and headed out, ignoring Lia\u0027s protests about all the amazing things she could do for Jill. Maybe someday, I thought. Someday when all of Jill\u0027s problems are gone. Something told me that day was far away, however. Although my loyalty to Spencer\u0027s was steadfast, a small French cafe caught my attention as I walked back to my car. Or rather, the scent of their coffee caught my attention. I had no obligations at school and stopped into the cafe for a cup. I had a book for English class on me and decided to do some reading at one of the cafe\u0027s small tables. Half of that time was spent texting back and forth with Brayden. He\u0027d wanted to know what I was reading, and we were swapping our favorite Tennessee Williams quotes. I\u0027d barely been there for ten minutes when shadows fell over me, blocking the late afternoon sun. Two guys stood there, neither of whom I knew. They were a little older than me, one blond haired and blue eyed while the other was dark haired and deeply tanned. Their expressions weren\u0027t hostile, but they weren\u0027t friendly either. Both were well built, like those who trained regularly. And then, after a double-take, I realized I did recognize one of them. The dark-haired guy was the one who\u0027d approached Sonya and me a while ago, claiming to know her from Kentucky. Immediately, all the panic I\u0027d been trying to suppress this last week came back to me, that sense of being trapped and helpless. It was only the realization that I was in a public place, surrounded by people, which allowed me to regard these two with astonishing calm. \"Yes?\" I asked. \"We need to talk to you, Alchemist,\" said the blond guy. I didn\u0027t twitch a muscle in my face. \"I think you\u0027ve got me mixed up with someone else.\" \"No one else around here has a lily tattoo,\" said the other guy. He\u0027d said his name was Jeff, but I wondered if he\u0027d told the truth. \"It\u0027d be great if you could take a walk with us.\" My tattoo was covered up today, but something told me these guys had been following me for a while and didn\u0027t need to see the lily to know it was there. \"Absolutely not,\" I said. I didn\u0027t even need Wolfe\u0027s reminders to know that was a terrible idea. I was staying here in the safety of the crowd. \"If you want to talk, you\u0027d best take a seat. Otherwise, go away.\" I looked back down at my book, like I didn\u0027t have a care in the world. Meanwhile, my heart was pounding, and it took every ounce of control I had to keep my hands from shaking. A few moments later, I heard the sounds of metal scraping on concrete, and the two guys sat down opposite me. I looked back up at their impassive faces. \"You\u0027ve got to go inside if you want coffee,\" I remarked. \"They don\u0027t have service out here.\" \"We\u0027re not here to talk about the coffee,\" said Jeff. \"We\u0027re here to talk about vampires.\" \"Why? Are you filming a movie or something?\" I asked. \"We know you hang out with them,\" said Blond Hair. \"Including that Strigoi, Sonya Karp.\" Part of my tattoo\u0027s magic was to prevent Alchemists from revealing information about the vampire world to outsiders. We literally couldn\u0027t do it. The magic would kick in and prevent it if we tried. Since these guys seemed to already know about vampires, the tattoo wasn\u0027t going to censor my words. Instead, I chose to censor myself of my own free will. Something told me ignorance was the best tactic here. \"Vampires aren\u0027t real,\" I said. \"Look, if this is some kind of a joke - \" \"We know what you do,\" continued Blond Hair. \"You don\u0027t like them any more than we do. So why are you helping them? How could your group have gotten so muddled and lost sight of our original vision? Centuries ago, we were one united group, determined to see all vampires wiped from the face of the earth in the name of the light. Your brethren betrayed that goal.\" I had another protest ready, and then I noticed a glint of gold in Jeff\u0027s ear. He was wearing a tiny earring, a small golden sphere with a dark dot in the middle. I couldn\u0027t help myself. \"Your earring,\" I said. \"It\u0027s the sun symbol - the symbol for gold.\" And, I realized, it was exactly the same symbol that had been on the hilt of the sword we\u0027d retrieved from the alley. He touched his earring and nodded. \"We haven\u0027t forgotten the mission - or our original purpose. We serve the light. Not the darkness that hides vampires.\" I still refused to acknowledge anything they said about vampires. \"You\u0027re the ones who attacked my friend and me in the alley last week.\" Neither one denied it. \"Your \u0027friend\u0027 is a creature of darkness,\" said Blond Hair. \"I don\u0027t know how she\u0027s managed this current enchantment - making herself look like one of the other vampires - but you can\u0027t be fooled. She\u0027s evil. She\u0027ll kill you and countless others.\" \"You guys are crazy,\" I said. \"None of this makes any sense.\" \"Just tell us where her main lair is,\" said Jeff. \"We know it\u0027s not that apartment on the other side of downtown. We\u0027ve been watching it and she hasn\u0027t returned since our last attempt to destroy her. If you won\u0027t actively help us, that information will be all we need to rid the world of her evil.\" We\u0027ve been watching it. Adrian\u0027s apartment. Chills ran through me. How long had they been spying on his place? And to what extent? Had they simply sat outside in a car, stakeout style? Did they have high tech surveillance equipment? Wolfe had warned against being stalked in parking lots, not in homes. The small comfort I had here was that they obviously didn\u0027t know about Clarence\u0027s. Their surveillance couldn\u0027t have been that thorough if no one had followed her yet. But had they followed me? Did they know where I went to school? And with their own words, they were confirming the terrible reality I\u0027d hardly dared speculate about. It was a reality that meant there were forces moving unseen beneath the Alchemists\u0027 seemingly all-knowing vision, forces working against our goals. Vampire hunters were real. With that realization came a hundred more terrifying questions. What did this mean for the Moroi? Was Jill in danger? Was Adrian? \"The only thing I\u0027m going to do is call the police,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know who you guys are or why you\u0027re obsessed with my friend, but neither of us have done anything to you. You\u0027re even crazier than I first thought if you think I\u0027m going to tell you where she is so that you can stalk her.\" Then, by the sheerest luck, I saw a patrolling police officer walking down the street. The two guys at my table followed my gaze and undoubtedly could guess my thoughts. It would be very easy to call her over. We\u0027d filed no report about the alley attack, but accusing these guys of a recent assault would certainly detain them. In sync, they both rose. \"You\u0027re making a terrible mistake,\" Jeff said. \"We could have had this problem eradicated ages ago if our groups worked together. First the Strigoi, then the Moroi. Your misguided descent into their corruption has nearly ruined everything. Fortunately, we still walk the true path.\" The fact that he\u0027d just named the two groups was particularly alarming. These guys were scary, certainly, but less so if they were just talking about vampires in shadowy, vague terms. Using \"Moroi\" and \"Strigoi\" indicated extensive knowledge. Blond Hair tossed down a small, homemade pamphlet. \"Read this, and maybe you\u0027ll see the light. We\u0027ll be in touch.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t if I were you,\" I said. \"Mess with me again, and I\u0027ll do a lot more than just have a pleasant chat.\" My words came out more fiercely than I\u0027d expected. Maybe Dimitri and Wolfe were rubbing off on me. Jeff laughed as the two of them began walking away. \"Too bad you got so bogged down in books,\" he said. \"You\u0027ve got the spirit of a hunter.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-golden-lily-bloodlines-2/page-15.html","bookId":2042,"book":{"id":2042,"title":"The Golden Lily (Bloodlines #2)","description":"Storyline: The book follows Sydney Sage, a young Alchemist that is forced to hide inside a ritzy boarding school in Palm Springs, California so that she can protect Jill Dragomir, a Moroi princess.
