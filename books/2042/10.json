{"id":109536,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"THE SAN DIEGO TRIP continued to bother me, even though I knew I should let it go. As I often reminded myself, Adrian wasn\u0027t my concern, not like Jill and the others. Yet, I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about the terrible confrontation with him and Nathan - or Adrian\u0027s face afterwards. I felt even worse when a worried Eddie came to talk to me about Jill during breakfast on the following Monday. \"Something\u0027s wrong with her,\" he told me. Immediately, I looked up toward the cafeteria line, where Jill was waiting with her tray. There was a vacant look on her face, like she was barely aware of her surroundings. Even with no magical talent for auras, I could practically see the misery radiating off of her. \"Micah\u0027s noticed it too,\" Eddie added. \"But we don\u0027t know anything that could be upsetting her this much. Is it because of Lia? Or is she being harassed again?\" In that moment, I wasn\u0027t sure who I felt worse for: Adrian, Jill - or Eddie. There was practically as much pain in Eddie as there was in Jill. Oh, Eddie, I thought. Why do you keep doing this to yourself? He was clearly worried about her but wouldn\u0027t dare approach her or offer comfort. \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with Jill. It\u0027s Adrian, and she\u0027s feeling it through the bond. He\u0027s going through a rough time.\" I offered no more details on Adrian\u0027s situation. It wasn\u0027t my story to tell. Eddie\u0027s face darkened a little. \"It\u0027s not fair that she has to endure his moods.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Seems like it might be a fair trade for her being alive.\" Adrian using spirit to bring Jill back from the dead was still a troubling matter for me. Every bit of Alchemist training I had said that kind of magic was wrong, far worse than any of the other magic I\u0027d witnessed. One could even argue that what he\u0027d managed was only a few steps away from the undead immortality of Strigoi. At the same time, whenever I saw Jill bright and alive, I was convinced that Adrian had done a good thing. I\u0027d meant it when I said as much to him in San Diego. \"I suppose,\" said Eddie. \"I wish there was a way she could block him out. Or at least a way to make him a little less moody.\" I shook my head. \"From what I\u0027ve heard, Adrian was like that long before Jill was shadow-kissed.\" Still, that conversation stuck with me, and I spent the day asking myself: what could I do to make Adrian happier? A new father obviously wasn\u0027t possible. I would have tried that on myself years ago if I could. Slushes were also out, partially because they only offered ten minutes of comfort and because I was still recovering from the last one. An idea finally came to me later on, but it wasn\u0027t one I could easily implement. In fact, I knew my superiors would say it was nothing I should even attempt - which is why I decided to do it in a way that wouldn\u0027t leave an e-mail or paper trail. I couldn\u0027t do it today, however, so I made a mental note to deal with it later. Besides, who could say? Maybe Adrian would shake off the effects of his fatherly encounter on his own. These hopes were actually reinforced when I saw Jill the next day at a school assembly. Assemblies like this were still a new concept to me, and we\u0027d had exactly two since school started. One had been a welcoming gathering during our first week. The other had been a pep rally to cheer on the football team before Homecoming. Today\u0027s was called \"Healthy Lifestyles.\" I couldn\u0027t figure out what it was about or why it was important enough to interrupt my chemistry class. We were seated by grade in the school\u0027s gym, putting Jill and me in separate sections of the bleachers. Craning my neck to get a glimpse of her, I saw her sitting down near the front with Angeline and several friends she\u0027d made through Micah. They\u0027d welcomed her easily once they got to know her, which wasn\u0027t a surprise with how nice she was. Even Laurel, a girl who\u0027d once tormented Jill, now gave her a friendly look. Angeline said something that made Jill laugh, and, overall, there was definitely an improvement in Jill\u0027s attitude. A very big improvement, judging from how much she was giggling. My spirits rose. Maybe Adrian really had bounced back. \"Can someone tell me what this is about?\" I asked. I had Eddie and Micah on one side of me, Trey on the other. \"It\u0027s this group that comes to school and gives presentations about things like drugs and safe sex,\" explained Micah. He was pretty active in student government, so I wasn\u0027t surprised he knew about today\u0027s agenda. \"Those are kind of big topics,\" I said. \"Isn\u0027t this just supposed to be an hour? Doesn\u0027t seem like they can really provide thorough coverage of these issues.\" \"I think it\u0027s just supposed to be a quick overview,\" said Trey. \"Not like they\u0027re trying to do a seminar or anything.\" \"Well,\" I declared. \"They should.\" \"Did we miss anything?\" Julia and Kristin pushed their way through others and squeezed themselves in between Trey and me. Trey didn\u0027t seem to mind. \"We\u0027re trying to explain the point of this to Sydney,\" Trey told them. \"I thought the point was to get out of class,\" said Julia. Kristin rolled her eyes. \"This\u0027ll show you what you were missing by being homeschooled, Sydney.\" Nothing could have prepared me for the spectacle that followed - mostly because never in my craziest dreams had I imagined weighty social issues would be addressed in musical numbers. The group performing for us called themselves Koolin\u0027 Around, and the inappropriate use of that K was nearly enough to make me walk out then and there. Before each song, they\u0027d give a quick and totally vague info-blurb about the topic or - even worse - a skit. These little lectures always began with, \"Hey, kids!\" The first song was called \"STDs Are Not for Me.\" That was when I took out my math homework. \"Come on,\" Eddie told me, laughing. \"It\u0027s not that bad. And people should know about this stuff.\" \"Exactly,\" I said, not looking up from my homework. \"In trying to be \u0027hip\u0027 and \u0027relatable,\u0027 they\u0027re trivializing issues that need to be taken more seriously.\" The only time I tuned in again was when Koolin\u0027 Around had moved on to the evils of alcohol. One of the lyrics in their particularly atrocious song was, \"Don\u0027t listen to what your friends say / Bourbon will totally ruin your day.\" \"Ugh. That\u0027s it,\" I muttered. I sought out Jill again. She was watching with kind of a stunned disbelief, but just like earlier, there was none of that despair or melancholy. Some gut instinct told me why she\u0027d had the mood change. Adrian hadn\u0027t snapped out of his gloom. Most likely he was drinking his way through it. Sometimes Jill would pick up some of the sillier side effects of intoxication - like the giggling I\u0027d observed earlier - but eventually, alcohol actually numbed the spirit bond. The bright side of his indulgence was that it spared her some of his depression. The down side was that she could actually suffer the physical effects of a hangover later. Koolin\u0027 Around mercifully reached their last song, a big production number celebrating the joys of feeling good and living a healthy, happy lifestyle. They pulled up members of the student body to dance with them, earning a variety of reactions. Some students just stood there frozen and embarrassed, wearing expressions that said they were counting the seconds until this ended. Other students - particularly those who normally sought attention in class - made the biggest, most outlandish spectacle they could of themselves. \"Sydney.\" The warning note in Eddie\u0027s voice stopped me as I was about to return to my homework. That kind of concern could only be reserved for Jill, and I immediately looked at her again. Only, she wasn\u0027t the issue. Angeline was. One of the Koolin\u0027 Around members was trying to coax her out and even grabbed her hand. Angeline shook her head emphatically, but the guy seemed oblivious. Angeline might be okay around wild dances in the backwoods of West Virginia, but this was not a situation she was comfortable with. To be fair, what happened next wasn\u0027t entirely her fault. He really should have left her alone when she said no, but I guess he was too caught up in his feel-good mood. He actually managed to drag her to her feet, and that\u0027s when Angeline made her disapproval perfectly clear. She punched him. It was pretty impressive since the guy had almost a foot on her in height. I supposed that came from Eddie\u0027s training in how to take out taller Moroi. The guy staggered backward and fell, hitting the floor hard. There was a gasp from most of the students sitting nearby, though only one of the band members - a guitarist - noticed. The rest kept on singing and dancing. The guitarist hurried forward to her fallen colleague and must have threatened Angeline\u0027s personal space because Angeline punched her too. \"Eddie, do something!\" I said. He turned to me in astonishment. \"Like what? I\u0027d never make it there in time.\" It was true. We were two thirds of the way up in the bleachers, surrounded by others. I could only watch helplessly as the rest of the spectacle unfolded. The band soon caught on that something was terribly wrong, and their music faltered, finally coming to silence. Meanwhile, a group of teachers had rushed the floor, trying to pry Angeline away from Koolin\u0027 Around\u0027s bass player. There was a frantic look in her eyes, like a trapped animal that had gone beyond reason and only wanted escape. The teachers finally managed to restrain her, but not before she\u0027d thrown a speaker at the lead singer (she missed) and punched the school\u0027s shop teacher. Trey leaned forward, mouth gaping. \"That\u0027s your cousin? Wow.\" I didn\u0027t even bother responding. All I could think about was how in the world I was going to do damage control this time. Fighting was a serious offense in and of itself. I couldn\u0027t even imagine what attacking a motivational musical group would elicit. \"She took out, like, three people twice her size!\" Kristin exclaimed. \"And I mean took out. Knocked them to the floor.\" \"Yeah, I know,\" I said dismally. \"I\u0027m right here. I saw it all.\" \"How was she even able to do that?\" asked Julia. \"I taught her some moves,\" remarked Eddie in disbelief. Unsurprisingly, no one even bothered sending this to Mrs. Weathers. Angeline was referred directly to the principal and vice principal. After her display, maybe they felt there was safety in numbers. It may have been Mrs. Weathers\u0027s recommendation or simply the fact that our fictitious parents (and \"cousin\" Angeline\u0027s) were notoriously hard to get a hold of, but I was asked to accompany her when she met with the administration. My pre-briefing with Angeline was short and to the point. \"You will act apologetic and contrite,\" I told her as we sat outside the principal\u0027s office. \"What\u0027s contrite mean?\" \"Apologetic.\" \"Then why didn\u0027t you just say - \" \"And,\" I continued. \"If pushed for reasons, you will say you were overwhelmed and panicked. You\u0027ll say you don\u0027t know what came over you.\" \"But I didn\u0027t - \" \"And you will not mention how stupid they were or say anything negative whatsoever.\" \"But they are - \" \"In fact, don\u0027t speak at all unless you\u0027re asked something directly. If you let me handle this, it\u0027ll be over fast.\" Angeline apparently took that to heart because she crossed her arms and glared at me, refusing to say anything else. When we were ushered into the office, the principal and vice principal - Mrs. Welch and Mr. Redding, respectively - were both sitting on the same side of one desk. They were side by side, presenting a united front that again made me think they feared for their lives. \"Miss McCormick,\" began Mrs. Welch. \"I hope you know that what you did was completely out of line.\" McCormick was Angeline\u0027s fake last name around here. \"Violence and fighting of any kind are not tolerated at Amberwood,\" said Mr. Redding. \"We have high standards - standards meant to ensure the safety of everyone at this school - and expect our students to adhere to them. None of your other violations of school rules come close to what you did today.\" \"Even if we didn\u0027t have those other transgressions on file, there can be no question here,\" said Mrs. Welch. \"There is no place for you at Amberwood.\" My stomach sank. Expulsion. Although the Keepers weren\u0027t entirely uneducated, her academic background had hardly been up to that of average high school students in the modern world. She was in a lot of remedial classes, and getting her into Amberwood at all had been quite a feat. Expulsion wasn\u0027t as bad as someone investigating how a petite girl like her could do so much damage, but it still wasn\u0027t an outcome I wanted. I could already imagine one of my superiors asking, why didn\u0027t you realize how volatile the school was making her? To which I would have to respond: because I\u0027ve been too busy going on dates and helping vampires who aren\u0027t my concern. \"Do you have anything to say for yourself before we notify your parents?\" asked Mrs. Welch. They looked at Angeline expectantly. I braced myself for an irrational tirade. Instead, Angeline managed to produce some tears which, I had to admit, certainly looked contrite. \"I... I panicked,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know what came over me. So much happened at once, and that guy was so scary, and I just freaked out. I felt threatened. I wanted everyone to get away from me...\" I was nearly convinced, probably because it was seeded with truth. Angeline had had a number of flustered moments at Amberwood, no matter her bravado. There were more people at the school than had been in her mountain community, and she\u0027d been so overwhelmed in her first week that we\u0027d had to take turns escorting her to class. I really should\u0027ve been paying more attention to her. Mr. Redding looked a tiny bit sympathetic - but not enough to change his mind. \"I\u0027m sure that must have been hard, but it was hardly reason for you to act in that way. Injuring three people and damaging expensive audio visual equipment were in no way appropriate responses.\" Understatement. I was tired of the formalities and needed to fix things before they escalated further. I leaned forward in my chair. \"You know what else isn\u0027t appropriate? A thirty-year-old guy - because that\u0027s how old he was, no matter how young and cool they were trying to be - grabbing a fifteen-year-old girl. It was bad enough that he did so when she clearly didn\u0027t want to go with him. The point is he never should have touched her in the first place. She\u0027s a minor. If a teacher did that, he\u0027d be fired. I\u0027ve read the book teachers are given from your HR department.\" It had been an attempt to see if Ms. Terwilliger was abusing me. \"Medical emergencies and breaking up a fight are the only times teachers can lay hands on students. Now, you might argue that that guy wasn\u0027t a teacher or employed by the school, but his group was invited here by the school - which is obligated to keep its students safe. You\u0027re a private school, but I\u0027m certain the California Department of Education would have a few things to say about what happened here today - as will Angeline\u0027s father, who\u0027s a lawyer.\" He was actually the leader of a bunch of mountain vampires and had multiple wives, but that was beside the point. I looked back and forth between Mrs. Welch and Mr. Redding\u0027s faces. \"Now then. Shall we renegotiate your position?\" Angeline was in awe after we left the office and went back to our dorm. \"Suspension,\" she exclaimed, a bit too much joy in her voice for my liking. \"I really just get to skip class? That sounds more like a reward.\" \"You still have to keep up with your homework,\" I warned. \"And you can\u0027t leave the dorm. Don\u0027t even think about sneaking out because that will get you expelled, and I won\u0027t be able to save you again.\" \"Still,\" she said, practically skipping, \"this was all pretty easy.\" I came to a halt in front of her, forcing her to face me. \"It was not easy. You got off on a technicality. You\u0027ve continually resisted efforts to follow the rules around here, and today - well, that was off the charts. You aren\u0027t back home. The only time you should even think about fighting here is if Jill is attacked. That\u0027s why you\u0027re here. Not to do whatever you want. You said you were up to the challenge of protecting her. If you get expelled - and it\u0027s a miracle you weren\u0027t - she\u0027s at risk. So get in line or start packing for home. And for God\u0027s sake, leave Eddie alone.\" Her face had been kindling with anger as I spoke, but that last bit caught her off guard. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, you constantly throwing yourself at him.\" She sniffed. \"That\u0027s how you show a guy you like him.\" \"Maybe among the uncivilized! Here you need to back off and start acting like a responsible human being - er, dhampir. Whatever. You\u0027re making him miserable! Besides, you\u0027re supposed to be cousins. You\u0027re screwing up our cover.\" Angeline\u0027s jaw dropped. \"I... I\u0027m making him miserable?\" I almost felt bad for her. The look of shock on her face was so great that it was obvious she really hadn\u0027t known what she was doing to Eddie was wrong. I was too worked up to feel much sympathy right then, though. Jill had acted out when we\u0027d first arrived, and that had been just as frustrating. I\u0027d come to enjoy our peace, and now Angeline was threatening all of that. Unlike Jill, she didn\u0027t seem to realize it, and I didn\u0027t know if that made things better or worse. I left an upset and frustrated Angeline off at her dorm room and also verified with Jill that Adrian had indeed been drinking. That and my agitation were more than enough to make me want to leave campus, if only for the escape. Brayden had asked earlier if I wanted to go out, but I wasn\u0027t up to that. I sent a quick text: Can\u0027t go out tonight. Family stuff. Then I headed off to Clarence\u0027s. I\u0027d called ahead to make sure Dimitri and Sonya were there since I had no interest in having a one-on-one visit with the ancient Moroi. He wasn\u0027t around when I arrived. I found Dimitri and Sonya huddled over some cards with blots of dried blood, speculating on how to proceed. \"It\u0027d be interesting to get Strigoi blood and see if anything happened when I applied spirit,\" she was saying. \"Do you think you could manage that?\" \"Gladly,\" said Dimitri. They noticed me. As soon as she looked up, Sonya asked, \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I didn\u0027t even bother asking how she knew. My face probably said more than my aura did. \"Angeline got into a brawl with a motivational group at school.\" Dimitri and Sonya exchanged looks. \"Maybe we should go get some dinner,\" he said. He grabbed a set of keys from the table. \"Let\u0027s go downtown.\" I never would\u0027ve imagined that I\u0027d look forward to going out with a Moroi and a dhampir. It was yet another sign of how far I\u0027d advanced - or regressed, by Alchemist standards. Compared to most of the other people in my life, Dimitri and Sonya were grounded and stable. It was refreshing. I gave them a rundown of Angeline\u0027s behavior, as well as my thinly veiled legal threat. That part seemed to amuse Sonya. \"Smart,\" she said, twirling spaghetti on a fork. \"Maybe you should be in law school instead of the Alchemists.\" Dimitri found it less funny. \"Angeline came here to do a job. She wanted out of the Keepers and swore she\u0027d devote every waking minute to protecting Jill.\" \"There has been a bit of a culture shock,\" I admitted, unsure as to why I was defending Angeline. \"And those guys today... I mean, if they\u0027d tried to get me to join their sing-along, I probably would\u0027ve punched them too.\" \"Unacceptable,\" said Dimitri. He used to be a combat instructor, and I could understand why. \"She\u0027s here on a mission. What she did was reckless and irresponsible.\" Sonya gave him a sly smile. \"And here I thought you had a soft spot for reckless young girls.\" \"Rose never would have done anything like that,\" he countered. He paused to reconsider, and I could\u0027ve sworn there was the hint of a smile there. \"Well, at least not in such a public setting.\" Once the Angeline topic was put to rest, I brought up the reason I\u0027d come here. \"So... no experiments today?\" Even Sonya\u0027s good nature faltered. \"Ah. No, not exactly. We\u0027ve gone over some notes on our own, but Adrian hasn\u0027t been... he hasn\u0027t been quite up to the research this week. Or up to going to class.\" Dimitri nodded. \"I was over there earlier. He could barely answer the door. No idea what he\u0027d been drinking, but whatever it was, he\u0027d had a lot.\" Considering their rocky relationship, I would\u0027ve expected disdain in discussing Adrian\u0027s vices. Instead, Dimitri sounded disappointed, as though he\u0027d expected better. \"That\u0027s what I wanted to talk to you about,\" I said. I\u0027d eaten little of my dinner and was nervously tearing a roll into pieces. \"Adrian\u0027s current mood isn\u0027t entirely his fault. I mean, it is, but I can kind of understand it. You know we saw his dad this weekend, right? Well... it didn\u0027t go well.\" There was a knowing glint in Dimitri\u0027s dark eyes. \"I\u0027m not surprised. Nathan Ivashkov isn\u0027t the easiest man to get along with.\" \"He sort of tore down everything Adrian\u0027s been trying to do. I tried to make a case for Adrian, but Mr. Ivashkov wouldn\u0027t listen. That\u0027s why I was wondering if you guys could help.\" Sonya couldn\u0027t hide her surprise. \"I\u0027d gladly help Adrian, but something tells me Nathan\u0027s not going to really put much stock in what we have to say.\" \"That\u0027s not what I was thinking.\" I gave up on the bread and dropped all the pieces to my plate. \"You guys are both close to the queen. Maybe you could get her to tell Adrian\u0027s dad how... I don\u0027t know. What an asset he\u0027s been. How much he\u0027s been helping. Obviously, she couldn\u0027t explain exactly what he\u0027s doing, but anything might help. Mr. Ivashkov won\u0027t listen to Adrian or anyone else, but he\u0027d have to take a commendation from the queen seriously. If she\u0027d do it.\" Dimitri looked thoughtful. \"Oh, she\u0027d do it. She\u0027s always had a soft spot for him. Everyone seems to.\" \"No,\" I said stubbornly. \"Not everyone. There\u0027s a split. Half condemn him and write him off as useless like his dad. The other half just shrug and indulge him and say, \u0027Well, that\u0027s Adrian.\u0027\" Sonya studied me carefully, a trace of that amusement returning. \"And you?\" \"I don\u0027t think he should be babied or disregarded. If you expect him to do great things, he will.\" Sonya said nothing right away, and I shifted uncomfortably under her scrutiny. I didn\u0027t like when she looked at me like this. It was about more than auras. It was like she could see into my heart and soul. \"I\u0027ll speak to Lissa,\" she said at last. \"And I\u0027m sure Dimitri will too. In the meantime, let\u0027s hope that if we follow your advice and expect Adrian to sober up soon, he will.\" We had just paid the check when Dimitri\u0027s cell phone rang. \"Hello?\" he answered. And like that, his face transformed. That fierceness I so associated with him softened, and he practically glowed. \"No, no. It\u0027s always a good time for you to call, Roza.\" Whatever the response on the other end was, it made him smile. \"Rose,\" said Sonya to me. She stood up. \"Let\u0027s give them a little privacy. You want to take a walk?\" \"Sure,\" I said, rising as well. Outside, dusk was falling. \"There\u0027s a costume store a few blocks away I actually want to check - if they\u0027re still open.\" Sonya glanced at Dimitri. \"Meet us there?\" she whispered. He gave a quick nod. Once we were outside in the warm evening air, she laughed. \"Ah, those two. In a fight, they\u0027re lethal. Around each other, they melt.\" \"Is that how you and Mikhail are?\" I asked, thinking there wasn\u0027t much melting with Brayden and me, no matter how much I enjoyed spending time with him. She laughed again and glanced up at the sky, painted in shades of orange and blue. \"Not exactly. Every relationship is different. Everyone loves differently.\" There was a long pause as she chose her next words. \"That was a nice thing you chose to do for Adrian.\" \"There was no choice to be made,\" I countered. We crossed onto a busier street, full of brightly lit stores with water misters outside that were meant to cool off hot shoppers. I winced at what that mist was doing to my hair. \"I had to help. He didn\u0027t deserve that kind of treatment. I can\u0027t imagine how Adrian\u0027s put up with that his whole life. And would you believe that what worried Adrian the most was that I would think less of him?\" \"Actually,\" said Sonya softly, \"I can very much believe that.\" The costume store was still open, thanks to extended Halloween hours, but only for ten more minutes. Sonya wandered around the aisles with no real goal, but I headed immediately for the historical section. They had exactly one Greek-style dress left, a plain white gown with a gold plastic belt. I knelt down to take a better look. Opening the package, I felt the fabric. It was cheap, probably flammable. The dress was also an XL, and I wondered if Jill had learned enough in sewing club to take it in for me. With less than a week until the dance, my options were limited. \"Really?\" a voice beside me said. \"Haven\u0027t you insulted me enough without resorting to this trash?\" Standing above me was Lia DiStefano. Her curly hair was bound up with a bright red scarf, and a voluminous peasant blouse made her petite body look like it had wings. She peered down at me disapprovingly with kohl-lined eyes. \"Are you following me?\" I asked, getting to my feet. \"Every time I\u0027m downtown, here you are.\" \"If I were following you, I never would have let you set foot in here in the first place.\" She pointed at the costume. \"What is that?\" \"My outfit for Halloween,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going Greek.\" \"It\u0027s not even the right size.\" \"I\u0027ll get it taken in.\" She tsked. \"I\u0027m so appalled, I don\u0027t even know where to start. You want a Greek dress? I\u0027ll make you one. A good one. Not this monstrosity. My God. People know you know me. If you were seen in that, it\u0027d ruin my career.\" \"Yeah, because what I wear to a high school dance will really make or break you.\" \"When\u0027s your dance?\" she asked. \"Saturday.\" \"Easy,\" she declared. She gave me a once-over and nodded in satisfaction. \"Easy measurements too. Is your sister dressing just as badly?\" \"Not sure,\" I admitted. \"She talked about making a fairy dress in sewing club. A blue one, I think.\" Lia blanched. \"Even worse. I\u0027ll make her a dress too. I\u0027ve already got her measurements.\" I sighed. \"Lia, I know what you\u0027re trying to do, and it won\u0027t work. Jill absolutely cannot model for you again. It doesn\u0027t matter how much bribery you try.\" Lia attempted an innocent look that was in no way convincing. \"Who said anything about bribery? I\u0027m doing this out of charity. It\u0027d be a disgrace to let you two go out in anything less than the best.\" \"Lia - \" \"Do not buy that,\" she warned, pointing at the costume. \"It\u0027s a waste. You might as well set your money on fire - although, it probably wouldn\u0027t light as fast as that dress. I\u0027ll let you know when your costumes are ready.\" With that, she turned on her high wooden heels and walked away, leaving me staring. \"Did you get a costume?\" Sonya asked me later, once the closing store forced us to leave. \"Weirdly, yes,\" I said. \"But not from there.\" Dimitri apparently wasn\u0027t done with his call, since he hadn\u0027t joined us yet. We strolled leisurely back toward the restaurant, wanting to give him more time with Rose. Other stores were closing, and the tourists were beginning to thin out. I explained the meeting with Lia. Sonya found it more amusing than I did. \"Well, don\u0027t knock it,\" she said. \"If a designer wants to make you something, you\u0027re not obligated to give her anything else. Maybe she could help me out with bridesmaid dresses.\" We crossed a less busy street and cut through a narrow alley with a brick building on one side and a tree-filled church lawn on the other. I\u0027d admired the church on our way over, but now, in only a short time, evening had filled it with shadows and given it a foreboding look and feel. I was glad I wasn\u0027t walking through here alone.
