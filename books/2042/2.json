{"id":109529,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"I DIDN\u0027T SLEEP THAT NIGHT. Part of it was simply the time change. My flight back to Palm Springs was scheduled for six in the morning - which was three in the morning in the time zone my body still thought it was in. Sleeping seemed pointless.\\n\\n And, of course, there was the teeny-tiny fact that it was kind of hard to relax after everything I\u0027d witnessed over at the Alchemist bunker. If I wasn\u0027t envisioning Liam\u0027s freaky eyes, then I was replaying the constant warnings I\u0027d heard about those who got too close to vampires.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t help the situation that I had an inbox full of messages from the gang in Palm Springs. Normally, I checked my e-mail automatically on my phone when I was out and about.\\n\\n Now, in my hotel room, staring at the various messages, I found myself filled with doubt. Were these truly professional? Were they too friendly? Did they blur the lines of Alchemist protocol?\\n\\n After seeing what had happened to Keith, it was more obvious than ever that it didn\u0027t take much to get in trouble with my organization.\\n\\n One message was from Jill, with a subject line reading: Angeline... sigh. This wasn\u0027t a surprise to me, and I didn\u0027t bother reading it yet. Angeline Dawes, a dhampir recruited to be Jill\u0027s roommate and provide an extra layer of security, had had a little trouble fitting into Amberwood.\\n\\n She was always in trouble for something, and I knew whatever it was this time, there was nothing I could do about it right now.\\n\\n Another message was from Angeline herself. I also didn\u0027t read it. The subject was: READ\\n\\n THIS! SO FUNNY! Angeline had only recently discovered e-mail. She had not, so it seemed, discovered how to turn off the caps-lock key. She also had no discrimination when it came to forwarding jokes, financial scams, or virus warnings. And speaking of that last one... we\u0027d had to finally install child protection software on her laptop, in order to block her from certain websites and ads. That had come after she\u0027d accidentally downloaded four viruses.\\n\\n It was the last e-mail in my inbox that gave me pause. It was from Adrian Ivashkov, the only person in our group who wasn\u0027t posing as a student at Amberwood Preparatory School.\\n\\n Adrian was a twenty-one-year-old Moroi, so it would have been kind of a stretch passing him off in high school. Adrian was along because he and Jill had a psychic bond that had been inadvertently created when he\u0027d used his magic to save her life. All Moroi wielded some type of elemental magic, and his was spirit - a mysterious element tied to the mind and healing. The bond allowed Jill to see Adrian\u0027s thoughts and emotions, which was troubling to both of them.\\n\\n His staying near her helped them work out some of the bond\u0027s kinks. Also, Adrian had nothing better to do.\\n\\n His message\u0027s subject was: SEND HELP IMMEDIATELY. Unlike Angeline, Adrian knew the rules of capitalization and was simply going for dramatic effect. I also knew that if I had any doubts about which of my messages related to my job, this was hands-down the most nonprofessional one in the set. Adrian wasn\u0027t my responsibility. Yet, I clicked the message anyway.\\n\\n Day 24. Situation is growing worse. My captors continue to find new and horrific ways to torture me. When not working, Agent Scarlet spends her days examining fabric swatches for bridesmaid dresses and going on about how in love she is. This usually causes Agent Boring Borscht to regale us with stories of Russian weddings that are even more boring than his usual ones. My attempts at escape have been thwarted thus far. Also, I am out of cigarettes. Any assistance or tobacco products you can send will be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n - Prisoner 24601\\n\\n I began smiling in spite of myself. Adrian sent me some kind of message like this nearly every day. This summer, we had learned that those who were forcibly turned Strigoi could be turned back with the use of spirit. It was still a tricky, complicated process... made more so by the fact that there were so few spirit users. Even more recent events had suggested that those restored from being Strigoi could never be turned again. That had electrified Alchemists and Moroi alike. If there was some magical way to prevent Strigoi conversion, freaks like Liam would no longer be a problem.\\n\\n That was where Sonya Karp and Dimitri Belikov came in - or, as Adrian called them in his angst-filled letters, \"Agent Scarlet\" and \"Agent Boring Borscht.\" Sonya was a Moroi; Dimitri was a dhampir. Both had once been Strigoi and had been saved by spirit magic. The two of them had come to Palm Springs last month to work with Adrian in a sort of think tank to figure out what might protect against Strigoi turning. It was an extremely important task, one that could have huge ramifications if successful. Sonya and Dimitri were some of the hardest working people I knew - which didn\u0027t always mesh with Adrian\u0027s style.\\n\\n A lot of their work involved slow, painstaking experiments - many involving Eddie Castile, a dhampir who was also undercover at Amberwood. He was serving as the control subject since, unlike Dimitri, Eddie was a dhampir untouched by spirit or a Strigoi history. There wasn\u0027t much I could do to help Adrian with his frustration over his research group - and he knew it. He just liked playing up the drama and venting to me. Mindful of what was essential and nonessential in the Alchemist world, I was on the verge of deleting the message, but...\\n\\n One thing made me hesitate. Adrian had signed his e-mail with a reference to Victor Hugo\u0027s Les Miserables. It was a book about the French Revolution that was so thick, it could easily double as a weapon. I had read it in both French and English. Considering Adrian had once gotten bored while reading a particularly long menu, I had a hard time imagining he\u0027d read the Hugo book in any language. So how did he know the reference? It doesn\u0027t matter, Sydney, a stern Alchemist voice said inside my head. Delete it. It\u0027s irrelevant. Adrian\u0027s literary knowledge (or lack thereof) is no concern of yours.\\n\\n But I couldn\u0027t do it. I had to know. This was the kind of detail that would drive me crazy. I wrote back with a quick message: How do you know about 24601? I refuse to believe you read the book. You saw the musical, right?\\n\\n I hit send and received a response back from him almost immediately: SparkNotes.\\n\\n Typical. I laughed out loud and immediately felt guilty. I shouldn\u0027t have responded. This was my personal e-mail account, but if the Alchemists ever felt the need to investigate me, they\u0027d have no qualms about accessing it. This kind of thing was damning, and I deleted the e-mail exchange - not that it mattered. No data was ever truly lost.\\n\\n By the time I landed in Palm Springs at seven the next morning, it was painfully obvious that I had surpassed my body\u0027s limits to subsist on caffeine. I was too exhausted. No amount of coffee would help anymore. I nearly fell asleep at the airport\u0027s curb, waiting for my ride.\\n\\n When it arrived, I didn\u0027t notice until I heard my name called.\\n\\n Dimitri Belikov jumped out of a blue rental car and strode toward me, grabbing hold of my suitcase before I could utter a word. A few nearby women stopped talking to stare at him admiringly.\\n\\n I got to my feet. \"You don\u0027t have to do that,\" I said, even though he was already loading my suitcase into the trunk.\\n\\n \"Of course I do,\" he said, his words lightly touched with a Russian accent. He gave me a small smile. \"You looked like you were asleep.\"\\n\\n \"I should be so lucky,\" I said, getting into the passenger side. Even if I\u0027d been wide awake, I knew Dimitri would\u0027ve taken my suitcase anyway. That\u0027s how he was, a lost remnant of chivalry in the modern world, ever-ready to help others.\\n\\n That was only one of the many striking things about Dimitri. His looks alone were certainly enough to make many halt in their tracks. He had dark brown hair pulled back into a short ponytail, with matching brown eyes that seemed mysterious and alluring. He was tall, too - about 67 - rivaling some Moroi. Dhampirs were indistinguishable from humans to me, so even I could admit that he scored pretty high on the attractiveness scale.\\n\\n There was also an energy around him that you couldn\u0027t help but be affected by. He was always on alert, always ready for the unexpected. I\u0027d never seen his guard down. He was constantly ready to strike. He was dangerous, no question, and I was comforted that he was on our side. I always felt safe around him - and a little wary.\\n\\n \"Thanks for the ride,\" I added. \"I could\u0027ve called a taxi.\" Even as I spoke, I knew my words were as useless as when I\u0027d told him he didn\u0027t need to help me with my bag.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s no problem,\" he assured me, driving toward suburban Palm Springs. He wiped sweat off his brow and somehow made that look attractive. Even this early in the morning, the heat was beginning to build. \"Sonya insisted. Besides, no experiments today.\" I frowned at that. Those experiments and the amazing potential they represented to prevent the creation of more Strigoi were vastly important. Dimitri and Sonya knew that and were dedicated to the cause - especially on weekends, when Adrian and Eddie didn\u0027t have classes - which made this news so puzzling. My own work ethic had a hard time understanding why there\u0027d be no research happening on a Sunday.\\n\\n \"Adrian?\" I guessed. Maybe he wasn\u0027t \"in the mood\" for research today.\\n\\n \"Partially,\" said Dimitri. \"We\u0027re also missing our control subject. Eddie said he had some conflict and couldn\u0027t make it.\"\\n\\n My frown deepened. \"What conflict could Eddie have?\"\\n\\n Eddie was intensely dedicated too. Adrian sometimes called him mini-Dimitri. Although Eddie was going to high school and completing assignments just like me, I knew he\u0027d drop any homework in an instant to help out with the greater good. I could think of only one thing that would take precedence over helping find a \"cure\" for being Strigoi. My heart suddenly raced.\\n\\n \"Is Jill okay?\" She had to be. Someone would have told me, right? Eddie\u0027s main purpose in Palm Springs - and mine - was to keep her safe. If she was in danger, it would trump everything else.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s fine,\" said Dimitri. \"I talked to her this morning. I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s going on, but Eddie wouldn\u0027t be away without good reason.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose not,\" I murmured, still concerned.\\n\\n \"You worry as much as me,\" teased Dimitri. \"I didn\u0027t think that was possible.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my job to worry. I always have to make sure everyone\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes it\u0027s not a bad thing to make sure you\u0027re okay too. You might find it actually helps others.\"\\n\\n I scoffed. \"Rose always joked about your \u0027Zen Master Wisdom.\u0027 Am I getting a taste of it?\\n\\n If so, I can see why she was helpless against your charms.\" This earned me one of Dimitri\u0027s rare, genuine laughs. \"I think so. If you ask her, she\u0027ll claim it was the staking and decapitation. But I\u0027m sure it was the Zen wisdom that won her in the end.\"\\n\\n My answering smile immediately melted into a yawn. It was amazing that I could joke with a dhampir. I used to have panic attacks being in the same room with them or Moroi. Slowly, over the last six months, my anxiety had begun to ease up. I\u0027d never shake the feeling of\\n\\n \"otherness\" I got from all of them, but I\u0027d come a long way. Part of me knew it was a good thing that I still drew that line between them and humans, but it was also good to be flexible in order to make my job smoother. Not too flexible, that inner Alchemist voice warned.\\n\\n \"Here we are,\" said Dimitri, pulling up in front of my dorm at Amberwood Prep. If he\u0027d noticed my shift in mood, he didn\u0027t say so. \"You should get some rest.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try,\" I said. \"But I need to find out what\u0027s going on with Eddie first.\" Dimitri\u0027s face turned all-business. \"If you can find him, you should bring him over tonight, and we can see about getting a little work done. Sonya would love it. She has some new ideas.\"\\n\\n I nodded, reminding myself that that was the kind of standard we needed to adhere to.\\n\\n Work, work, work. We had to remember our higher goals. \"I\u0027ll see what I can do.\" I thanked him again and then headed inside, filled with resolve to carry out my mission.\\n\\n So, it was a bit disappointing when my lofty goals were shattered so quickly.\\n\\n \"Miss Melrose?\"\\n\\n I turned immediately at the sound of the last name I\u0027d assumed here at Amberwood. Mrs.\\n\\n Weathers, our plump, elderly dorm matron, was hurrying over to me. Her face was lined with worry, which couldn\u0027t bode well.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re back,\" she said. \"I trust you had a good family visit?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" If by \"good,\" she meant \"terrifying and unsettling.\" Mrs. Weathers beckoned me over to her desk. \"I need to talk to you about your cousin.\" I held back a grimace as I recalled Jill\u0027s e-mail. Cousin Angeline. All of us attending Amberwood were doing so under fake family connections. Jill and Eddie were my siblings. Angeline was our cousin. It helped explain why we were always together and getting involved with each other\u0027s business.\\n\\n I sat down with Mrs. Weathers and thought longingly of my bed. \"What\u0027s happened?\" I asked.\\n\\n Mrs. Weathers sighed. \"Your cousin is having trouble with our dress code.\" That was a surprise. \"But we have uniforms, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" she said. \"But not outside of classes.\"\\n\\n That was true. I was in khaki dress pants and a green short-sleeved blouse, along with a small gold cross I always wore. I did a mental rundown of Angeline\u0027s wardrobe, trying to recall if I\u0027d ever seen anything concerning about it. Probably the most appalling part was its quality.\\n\\n Angeline had come from the Keepers, a mixed community of humans, Moroi, and dhampirs who lived in the Appalachian Mountains. Along with a lack of electricity and plumbing, the Keepers chose to make a lot of their clothing or at least wear it into threads.\\n\\n \"Friday night, I saw her wearing the most appallingly short jean shorts,\" continued Mrs.\\n\\n Weathers with a shudder. \"I immediately chastised her, and she told me they were the only way she could be comfortable in the heat outside. I gave her a warning and advised she find more appropriate attire. Saturday, she appeared in the same shorts and a tank top that was totally indecent. That was when I suspended her to the dorm for the rest of the weekend.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, ma\u0027am,\" I said. Really, I had no idea what else to say. I\u0027d spent the weekend caught up in the epic battle to save humanity, and now... jean shorts?\\n\\n Mrs. Weathers grew hesitant. \"I know... well, I know this isn\u0027t really anything you should be involved in. It\u0027s a parental matter. But, seeing as how you\u0027re so responsible and look out for the rest of your family...\"\\n\\n I sighed. \"Yes, ma\u0027am. I\u0027ll take care of it. Thank you for not taking more severe action against her.\"\\n\\n I went upstairs, my small suitcase growing heavier with each step. When I reached the second floor, I stopped, unsure what to do. One more floor would take me to my room. This floor would take me to \"Cousin Angeline.\" Reluctantly, I turned into the second floor hall, knowing the sooner this was dealt with, the better.\\n\\n \"Sydney!\" Jill Mastrano opened the dorm room\u0027s door, her light green eyes shining with joy. \"You\u0027re back.\"\\n\\n \"So it seems,\" I said, following her inside. Angeline was there as well, lounging on her bed with a textbook. I was pretty sure that was the first time I\u0027d ever seen her study, but the house arrest probably limited her recreational options.\\n\\n \"What did the Alchemists want?\" asked Jill. She sat cross-legged on her own bed and began absentmindedly playing with the strands of her curly, light brown hair.\\n\\n I shrugged. \"Paperwork. Boring stuff. Sounds like things were a little more exciting here.\" That was delivered with a pointed look at Angeline.\\n\\n The dhampir girl jumped off her bed, face furious and blue eyes flashing. \"It wasn\u0027t my fault! That Weathers woman was completely out of line!\" she exclaimed, a slight southern drawl in her words.\\n\\n A quick scan of Angeline showed nothing too concerning. Her jeans were threadbare but decent, as was her T-shirt. Even her mop of strawberry blonde hair was tame for a change, tied back in a ponytail.\\n\\n \"What on earth did you wear that got her so upset then?\" I asked.\\n\\n Scowling, Angeline went to her dresser and produced a pair of jean shorts with the most ragged hem I\u0027d ever seen. I thought they\u0027d unravel before my eyes. They were also so short that I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised if they showed underwear when she wore them.\\n\\n \"Where did you get those?\"\\n\\n Angeline almost looked proud. \"I made them.\"\\n\\n \"With what, a hacksaw?\"\\n\\n \"I had two pairs of jeans,\" she said pragmatically. \"It was so hot out, I figured I might as well turn one into shorts.\"\\n\\n \"She used a knife from the cafeteria,\" said Jill helpfully.\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t find the scissors,\" explained Angeline.\\n\\n My bed. Where was my bed?\\n\\n \"Mrs. Weathers mentioned something about an indecent shirt too,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Jill. \"That was mine.\"\\n\\n I felt my eyebrows rise. \"What? I know you don\u0027t own anything \u0027indecent.\"\u0027 Before Angeline had come along a month ago, Jill and I had been roommates.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not,\" agreed Jill. \"Except, it\u0027s not really Angeline\u0027s size.\" I glanced between the two girls and understood. Jill was tall and slim, like most Moroi, with a figure much coveted among human fashion designers, a figure I would\u0027ve killed to have. Jill had even done some modeling. With that figure came a modest chest. Angeline\u0027s chest...\\n\\n was not so modest. If she wore a tank top in Jill\u0027s size, I imagined the shirt\u0027s structural integrity would indeed be stretched to indecent limits.\\n\\n \"Jill wears that tank top all the time and doesn\u0027t get in trouble,\" said Angeline defensively.\\n\\n \"I figured there wouldn\u0027t be a problem if I borrowed it.\" My head was starting to hurt. Still, I supposed this was better than the time Angeline had been caught making out with a guy in the boys\u0027 bathroom. \"Well. This is easily fixed. We can go - well, I can go since you\u0027re stuck here - and get you some clothes in your size tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" Angeline said, suddenly turning more upbeat, \"you don\u0027t have to. Eddie\u0027s handling it.\"\\n\\n If not for Jill nodding along, I would\u0027ve thought it was a joke. \"Eddie? Eddie\u0027s buying you clothes?\"\\n\\n Angeline sighed happily. \"Isn\u0027t that nice of him?\"\\n\\n Nice? No, but I understood why Eddie would do it. Getting decent clothes for Angeline was the last thing he probably wanted to do, but he would do it. Like me, he understood duty.\\n\\n And now I could guess why Eddie had canceled the experiments - and been vague about his reasons for doing so.\\n\\n I immediately took out my cell phone and called him. He answered right away, like always.\\n\\n I was certain he was never more than three feet from his phone at all times. \"Hello, Sydney.\\n\\n Glad you\u0027re back.\" He paused. \"You are back, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m with Jill and Angeline. I understand you\u0027ve been doing some shopping.\" He groaned. \"Don\u0027t get me started. I just walked into my room.\"\\n\\n \"You want to swing by with your purchases? I need the car back anyway.\" There was a moment\u0027s hesitation. \"Would you mind coming over here? As long as Jill\u0027s okay. She is okay, right? She doesn\u0027t need me? Because if she does - \"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s fine.\" His dorm wasn\u0027t far, but I\u0027d been hoping for a quick nap. Nonetheless, I found myself agreeing, just like I always did. \"Okay. I\u0027ll meet you in the lobby in about fifteen minutes?\"\\n\\n \"Sounds good. Thanks, Sydney.\"\\n\\n As soon as I disconnected, Angeline asked excitedly, \"Is Eddie coming over?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to him,\" I said.\\n\\n Her face fell. \"Oh. Well, I guess it doesn\u0027t matter since I have to stay here anyway. I can\u0027t wait until I\u0027m free to train again. I\u0027d like to get some more one-on-one time with him.\" I hadn\u0027t realized how focused Angeline was on her training. In fact, she seemed really excited about the prospect of it.\\n\\n I left their room and was surprised to find Jill right behind me once the door shut. Her eyes were wide and anxious. \"Sydney... I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n I regarded her curiously, wondering now if she\u0027d done something. \"For what?\" She gestured toward the door. \"For Angeline. I should have done better at keeping her out of trouble.\"\\n\\n I almost smiled. \"That\u0027s not your job.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know...\" She glanced down, letting some of her long hair fall forward. \"But still. I know I should be more like you. Instead, I\u0027ve just been... you know. Having fun.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re entitled to it,\" I said, trying to ignore the subtle commentary on me.\\n\\n \"I should still be more responsible,\" she argued.\\n\\n \"You are responsible,\" I assured her. \"Especially compared to Angeline.\" My family had a cat back in Utah that I was pretty sure was more responsible than Angeline.\\n\\n Jill\u0027s face brightened, and I left her so that I could return the suitcase to my room. Angeline\u0027s arrival and my work in busting Keith had earned me my own private room in the dorm, something I treasured. Inside it, everything was quiet and orderly. My perfect world.\\n\\n The one place that the chaos of my life couldn\u0027t touch. The neatly made bed was asking to be slept in. Begging, really. Soon, I promised it. I hope.\\n\\n Amberwood Prep was divided into three campuses, East (where the girls were housed), West (where the boys were), and Central (containing all the academic buildings). A shuttle bus ran between them on a regular schedule, or brave souls could walk between them in the heat. I usually didn\u0027t mind the temperatures, but walking seemed like a lot of work today. So, I took the shuttle to West Campus and tried to stay awake.\\n\\n The lobby of the boys\u0027 dorm was a lot like my own, people coming and going to either catch up on academic work or simply enjoy the Sunday off. I glanced around, but Eddie wasn\u0027t here yet.\\n\\n \"Hey, Melbourne.\"\\n\\n I turned and found Trey Juarez approaching, a grin on his tanned face. He was a senior like me and had picked up the Melbourne nickname after one of our teachers proved incapable of remembering Melrose. Honestly, with all these names, it was a wonder I knew who I was anymore.\\n\\n \"Hey, Trey,\" I said. Trey was a bona fide high school football star - but also pretty brainy, no matter how much he tried to hide it. We got along well as a result, and my help in restoring his athletic status last month had gone a long way to raise my stock in his eyes. A backpack hung on one of his shoulders. \"Are you finally going to finish that chem lab write-up?\"\\n\\n \"Yup,\" he said. \"Me and half the cheerleading squad. You want to join us?\" I rolled my eyes. \"Somehow I doubt there\u0027ll be much work going on. Besides, I\u0027m meeting Eddie.\"\\n\\n Trey gave an easy shrug and brushed some unruly black hair out of his eyes. \"Your loss.\\n\\n See you tomorrow.\" He took a couple of steps and then glanced back at me. \"Hey, are you dating anyone?\"\\n\\n I immediately started to say no, and then a panicked thought occurred to me. I had a tendency to take things very literally. Friends of mine here, Kristin and Julia, had been trying to train me up in the subtleties of high school social life. One of their chief lessons was that what people said wasn\u0027t always what they meant - particularly in romantic matters.\\n\\n \"Are you... are you asking me out?\" I asked, taken aback. This was the last thing I needed right now. How should I respond? Should I say yes? Should I say no? I\u0027d had no idea helping him with chemistry homework would be so alluring. I should\u0027ve made him do it on his own.\\n\\n Trey looked as startled by the thought as I was. \"What? No. Of course not.\"\\n\\n \"Thank God,\" I said. I liked Trey, but I had no interest in dating him - or figuring out what the appropriate way to say \"no\" would be.\\n\\n He shot me a wry look. \"You don\u0027t have to look that relieved.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" I said, trying to mask my embarrassment. \"Why\u0027d you ask?\"\\n\\n \"Because I know the perfect guy for you. I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s your soul mate.\" We were back in familiar territory now: logic vs. lack of logic. \"I don\u0027t believe in soul mates,\" I said. \"It\u0027s statistically unreasonable that there\u0027s only one ideal person for everyone in the world.\" And yet, for half a moment, I wished it was kind of possible. It\u0027d be nice to have someone who understood some of the things that went on in my head.\\n\\n Trey rolled his eyes. \"Okay. Not a soul mate. How about just someone you could maybe go out with once in a while and have a nice time with?\" I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t have time for anything like that.\" And I didn\u0027t. Keeping everything in order with the group, and pretending to be a student, was a full time job as it was.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m telling you, you\u0027d like him. He goes to a public school and just started at Spencer\u0027s.\" Spencer\u0027s was a coffee shop Trey worked at, an arrangement that yielded me discounts. \"The other day, he was going off on unaerobic vs. aerobic respiration, and I was thinking, \u0027You know who this sounds like? Melbourne.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s anaerobic respiration,\" I corrected. \"And it still doesn\u0027t mean I have the time. Sorry.\" I had to admit, I was immensely curious about how that topic would have come up between baristas, but figured it was best not to encourage Trey.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t say I never tried to help you.\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t dream of it,\" I assured him. \"Hey, there\u0027s Eddie.\"\\n\\n \"My cue to go then. See you guys.\" Trey gave a mock salute to Eddie and me. \"Don\u0027t forget my offer if you want a hot date, Melbourne.\"\\n\\n Trey left, and Eddie shot me an astonished look. \"Did Trey just ask you out?\"\\n\\n \"No. He\u0027s just got some co-worker he wants to set me up with.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe that\u0027s not a bad idea.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a terrible idea. Let\u0027s go outside.\"\\n\\n The desert heat didn\u0027t seem to care that it was October, and I led us to a bench right by the dorm\u0027s stucco walls. Partial shade from some nearby palm trees offered mild relief.\\n\\n People swore the temperature would taper soon, but I\u0027d seen no sign of change. Eddie handed me my car keys and a shopping bag from a local superstore.\\n\\n \"I had to guess at size,\" he told me. \"When in doubt, I went big. Figured it was safer that way.\"\\n\\n \"Probably.\" I sat down on a bench and rifled through his purchases. Jeans, khakis, a few solid colored T-shirts. They were very practical, very much something a no-nonsense guy like Eddie would pick out. I approved. \"The size actually looks right. Good eye. We\u0027ll have to send you out shopping more often.\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s what I have to do,\" he said, face serious. I couldn\u0027t help but laugh in surprise.\\n\\n \"I was joking.\" I put the shirts back in the bag. \"I know that couldn\u0027t have been fun.\" Eddie\u0027s face gave nothing away. \"Oh, come on. It\u0027s okay. You don\u0027t have to play stoic with me. I know you didn\u0027t enjoy it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here to do a job. Doesn\u0027t matter if I enjoy it or not.\" I started to protest but then thought better of it. After all, wasn\u0027t that my philosophy too?\\n\\n Sacrificing my own wants for higher goals? Eddie was intensely dedicated to this mission. He never backed down. I expected nothing less from him than single-minded focus.\\n\\n \"So, does that mean you\u0027re up for some experiments tonight?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Of cours - \" He stopped and reconsidered. \"Are Jill and Angeline coming?\"\\n\\n \"No. Angeline\u0027s still under house arrest.\"\\n\\n \"Thank God,\" he said with visible relief.\\n\\n His reaction was probably the most surprising thing to happen today. I couldn\u0027t imagine why Eddie would look so relieved. Aside from his guardian loyalty to Jill, he was also crazy about her. He would\u0027ve done anything for her, even if it wasn\u0027t his job, but refused to share his feelings with her. He thought he was unworthy of a princess. An uneasy thought occurred to me.\\n\\n \"Are you... are you avoiding Jill because of her and Micah?\" Micah was Eddie\u0027s roommate, a nice guy who caused Eddie all sorts of therapy-worthy trauma because he bore so much similarity to Eddie\u0027s dead best friend, Mason. Micah also had a weird pseudo-dating relationship with Jill. None of us were happy about it, since (aside from the Keepers) humans dating Moroi or dhampirs was strictly taboo. We\u0027d finally decided it would be impossible to keep Jill from a social life, and she swore nothing serious or physical was going on between her and Micah. They just spent a lot of time together. And flirted incessantly.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t know the truth about her, but I wondered at what point he\u0027d want more from their relationship. Eddie kept insisting it was better for Jill to have a casual relationship with a human than one with an \"unworthy\" dhampir like him, but I knew it had to be torturous.\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" said Eddie sharply. \"It\u0027s not Jill I want to avoid. It\u0027s Angeline.\"\\n\\n \"Angeline? What\u0027s she done now?\"\\n\\n Eddie ran a hand through his hair in frustration. His was a sandy blond, not far from my own, which was a dark gold. The similarity made it easy to pass ourselves off as twins. \"She won\u0027t leave me alone! She\u0027s always dropping these suggestive comments when I\u0027m around...\\n\\n and she won\u0027t stop staring at me. Like, you wouldn\u0027t think that\u0027d be creepy, but it is. She\u0027s always watching. And I can\u0027t avoid her because she\u0027s with Jill a lot of the time, and I have to keep Jill safe.\"\\n\\n I thought back on recent interactions. \"Are you sure you\u0027re reading this right? I\u0027ve never noticed anything.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because you don\u0027t notice that kind of thing,\" he said. \"You cannot imagine how many excuses she finds to rub up against me.\"\\n\\n After seeing her homemade jean shorts, I actually could imagine it. \"Huh. Well, maybe I can talk to her.\"\\n\\n Like that, Eddie snapped back to all-business. \"No. It\u0027s my problem, my personal life. I\u0027ll deal with it.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure? Because I can - \"\\n\\n \"Sydney,\" he said gently. \"You\u0027re the most responsible person I know, but this isn\u0027t what you\u0027re here to do. You don\u0027t have to take care of everything and everyone.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mind,\" I said automatically. \"It is what I\u0027m here for.\" But even as I said it, I wondered if that was true. A bit of the anxiety from the bunker returned, making me question if what I did was truly Alchemist responsibility or the desire to help those who - against protocol -\\n\\n had become my friends.\\n\\n \"See? Now you sound just like I did earlier.\" He stood up and flashed me a grin. \"You want to come with me to Adrian\u0027s? Be responsible together?\" His words were meant as a compliment, but they echoed too close to what the Alchemists had told me. And Mrs. Weathers. And Jill. Everyone thought I was so amazing, so responsible and controlled.\\n\\n But if I was so amazing, then why was I always so unsure if I was doing the right thing? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-golden-lily-bloodlines-2/page-2.html","bookId":2042,"book":{"id":2042,"title":"The Golden Lily (Bloodlines #2)","description":"Storyline: The book follows Sydney Sage, a young Alchemist that is forced to hide inside a ritzy boarding school in Palm Springs, California so that she can protect Jill Dragomir, a Moroi princess.
