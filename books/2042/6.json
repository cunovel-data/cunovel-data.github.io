{"id":109532,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\"YOU SHOOK HIS HAND?\" Adrian asked incredulously.\\n\\n I shot an accusing look at Eddie and Angeline. \"Is nothing private around here?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Angeline, as bluntly honest as ever. Eddie actually chuckled. It was a rare moment of camaraderie between them.\\n\\n \"Was it supposed to be a secret?\" he asked. We were over at Clarence Donahue\u0027s house for Jill and Adrian\u0027s biweekly blood feedings. Jill was off right now with Clarence\u0027s human housekeeper, Dorothy, who doubled as his feeder. I could take a lot of Moroi things in stride now, but drinking blood - human blood - made me shudder every time. My best coping mechanism was trying to forget why we were here.\\n\\n \"No,\" I admitted. Julia and Kristin had grilled me for date details a couple of days ago, so I\u0027d given them some. I supposed I had to accept that once I told them anything, it would inevitably get back to everyone in the world. No doubt my Amberwood family had then passed it on to Adrian.\\n\\n \"Really?\" Adrian was still hung up on the end of my date. \"His hand?\" I sighed and sank back into a sleek leather sofa. Clarence\u0027s house always reminded me of some stereotypical haunted manor from the outside - but inside it was modern and well furnished.\\n\\n \"Look, it just happened - okay, you know what? Never mind. This is none of your business. Just let it go.\" But something in Adrian\u0027s expression told me he would not, in fact, be letting it go anytime soon.\\n\\n \"With all that red-hot passion, it\u0027s a wonder you guys can stay away from each other,\" said Adrian, deadpan. \"Is there going to be a second date?\" Eddie and Angeline looked at me expectantly. I hesitated. This was information I hadn\u0027t given up to Julia and Kristin, largely because it had only just been arranged. \"Yes,\" I said at last. \"We\u0027re going on a, um, windmill tour later this week.\" If I\u0027d wanted to shut them all up, I\u0027d definitely succeeded. They all looked stunned.\\n\\n Adrian spoke first. \"I\u0027m going to assume that means he\u0027s flying you to Amsterdam on his private jet. If so, I\u0027d like to come along. But not for the windmills.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a huge windmill farm north of Palm Springs,\" I explained. \"It\u0027s one of the only ones in the world that does public tours.\"\\n\\n More blank looks.\\n\\n \"Wind energy is a powerful renewable resource that could have a huge impact on our country\u0027s future!\" I said in exasperation. \"This is a cool thing.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Cool,\u0027\" said Adrian. \"\u0027Wind.\u0027 I see what you did there, Sage. Pretty clever.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t meant to be a - \"\\n\\n The sitting room\u0027s stained glass French doors opened, and Dimitri and Sonya entered with our host Clarence in tow. I hadn\u0027t seen him since I arrived and gave him a polite smile, glad for the distraction from my so-called love life.\\n\\n \"Hello, Mr. Donahue,\" I said. \"It\u0027s nice to see you again.\"\\n\\n \"Eh?\" The elderly Moroi man squinted in my direction, and after a few moments, recognition lit his features. He had white hair and always dressed as though he were at a formal dinner party from about fifty years ago. \"There you are. Glad you could stop by, my dear. What brings you over?\"\\n\\n \"Jill\u0027s feeding, sir.\" We did this two times every week, but Clarence\u0027s mind wasn\u0027t quite what it used to be. He\u0027d been pretty scattered since we first met, but the death of his son, Lee, had seemed to push the old man even farther over the edge - particularly since he didn\u0027t seem to believe it. We\u0027d told him gently - a number of times - that Lee had died, leaving out the Strigoi part. Each time we did, Clarence insisted Lee was just \"away right now\" and would be back. Scattered or not, Clarence was always kind and relatively harmless - for a vampire, of course.\\n\\n \"Ah, yes, naturally.\" He settled into his massive armchair and then glanced back toward Dimitri and Sonya. \"So you\u0027ll be able to fix the window locks?\" There had apparently been some other discussion going on before they joined us.\\n\\n Dimitri seemed to be trying to find a nice way to respond. He was as amazing to look at as ever, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, with a long leather duster over it all. How anyone could survive wearing a coat like that in Palm Springs was beyond me, but if anyone could, I supposed it was him. Usually he only wore it inside, but sometimes, I\u0027d see it outside too. I\u0027d mentioned this odd wardrobe choice to Adrian a couple of weeks ago: \"Isn\u0027t Dimitri hot?\" Adrian\u0027s response hadn\u0027t been entirely unexpected: \"Well, yeah, according to most women, at least.\"\\n\\n Dimitri\u0027s face was the picture of politeness as he addressed Clarence\u0027s concerns. \"I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s anything wrong with the ones you have,\" Dimitri said. \"Everything is sealed up pretty tightly.\"\\n\\n \"So it seems,\" said Clarence ominously. \"But you don\u0027t know how resourceful they are. I\u0027m not behind the times, you know. I know there are all sorts of technologies out there that you can put in. Like lasers that tell you if someone\u0027s breaking in.\" Dimitri arched an eyebrow. \"You mean a security system?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, exactly,\" said Clarence. \"That\u0027ll keep the hunters out.\" This turn in conversation wasn\u0027t exactly a surprise to me. Clarence\u0027s paranoia had also increased recently - and that was saying something. He lived in constant fear of what he claimed were vampire hunters, humans who... well, hunted vampires. For the longest time, he\u0027d claimed they were responsible for his niece\u0027s death and that reports of her being killed by a Strigoi were incorrect. It turned out he was half-right. Her death hadn\u0027t been the result of a Strigoi attack - it had been caused by Lee, in a desperate attempt to change back from a Moroi to a Strigoi. Clarence refused to accept that, however, and persisted in his beliefs about the hunters. My assurances that the Alchemists had no records of any groups like that existing since the Middle Ages hadn\u0027t gone very far. Consequently, Clarence was always making people do \"security checks\" of his house. Since Sonya and Dimitri were actually staying with him throughout the experimentation, that tedious task often fell to them.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not really qualified to install a security system,\" said Dimitri.\\n\\n \"Really? There\u0027s something you can\u0027t do?\" Adrian\u0027s voice was so soft that I could barely hear him, and he was sitting right next to me. I doubted even the others, with their superior hearing, could\u0027ve made out his words. Why does he still let Dimitri get to him? I wondered.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d have to call professionals,\" Dimitri continued to Clarence. \"I\u0027m guessing you wouldn\u0027t want a bunch of strangers coming in and out of your house.\" Clarence frowned. \"That\u0027s true. It\u0027d be very easy for the hunters to infiltrate them.\" Dimitri was the picture of patience. \"I\u0027ll do daily checks of all the doors and windows while I\u0027m here - just to be sure.\"\\n\\n \"That would be wonderful,\" said Clarence, some of his tension easing. \"Admittedly, I\u0027m not really the hunters\u0027 usual type. Not dangerous enough. Not anymore.\" He chuckled to himself.\\n\\n \"Still. You never know what could happen. Best to be safe.\" Sonya gave him a gentle smile. \"I\u0027m sure everything will be fine. You have nothing to worry about.\"\\n\\n Clarence met her eyes, and after a few seconds, a smile slowly spread over his face as well. His rigid posture slackened. \"Yes, yes. You\u0027re right. Nothing to worry about.\" I shivered. I\u0027d been around Moroi enough to know what had happened. Sonya had just used compulsion - only a whisper of it - to calm Clarence. Compulsion, the ability to force your will on others, was a skill all Moroi possessed to varying degrees. Spirit users were the strongest, rivaling Strigoi. Using compulsion on others was taboo among the Moroi, and there were serious consequences for those who abused it.\\n\\n I was guessing Moroi authorities would overlook her soothing a nervous old man, but the small act still unsettled me. Compulsion in particular had always struck me as one of the most insidious Moroi powers. And had Sonya really needed to use it? She was already so kind and soothing. Wouldn\u0027t that be enough for Clarence? Sometimes I wondered if they just used magic for the sake of doing so. Sometimes I wondered if it was being used around me... without me even knowing.\\n\\n Clarence\u0027s talk of vampire hunters always triggered a mix of amusement and unease around everyone. With him pacified (even if I didn\u0027t like the means), we were all able to relax a little bit. Sonya leaned back against the loveseat, drinking some fruity drink that looked perfect on a hot day like this. From her dirty clothes and haphazard hairstyling, I was willing to bet she\u0027d been outside - not that she still didn\u0027t look beautiful. Most Moroi avoided this kind of intense sun, but her love of plants was so great that she\u0027d been risking it to work on some of the ailing flowers in Clarence\u0027s garden. Heavy sunscreen could work wonders.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to be around much longer,\" she told us. \"A few more weeks at most. I need to go back and work on some wedding plans with Mikhail.\"\\n\\n \"When\u0027s the big day again?\" Adrian asked.\\n\\n She smiled. \"It\u0027s in December.\" That surprised me until she added, \"There\u0027s a huge, tropical greenhouse near the Court that we\u0027re going to use. It\u0027s gorgeous - not that it matters.\\n\\n Mikhail and I could be married anywhere. All that counts is that we\u0027re together. Of course, if we\u0027re able to choose, then why not go all out?\"\\n\\n Even I smiled at that. Leave it to Sonya to find a spot of green in the middle of a Pennsylvania winter.\\n\\n \"Dimitri may stay on,\" she continued. \"But it\u0027d be great if we could make some kind of progress before I go. The aura tests so far have been...\"\\n\\n \"Useless?\" suggested Adrian.\\n\\n \"I was going to say inconclusive,\" she replied.\\n\\n Adrian shook his head. \"So all that time we spent was wasted?\" Sonya didn\u0027t answer and instead took another sip of her drink. I was willing to bet it was non-alcoholic - she didn\u0027t self-medicate the way Adrian did - and that Dorothy could make me one if I wanted. Yet, I was also willing to bet it was terrible for me. Maybe I\u0027d see if there was any Diet Coke in the kitchen.\\n\\n Sonya leaned forward, an eager glint in her eye. \"Dimitri and I were talking and realized there\u0027s something obvious we\u0027ve been missing. Actually, I should say avoiding, but not pursuing it would be a waste.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" asked Adrian.\\n\\n \"Blood,\" said Dimitri.\\n\\n I winced. I didn\u0027t like it when this topic came up. It reminded me of exactly what kind of people I was with.\\n\\n \"Obviously, there\u0027s something about restored Strigoi that protects them - us,\" he said.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve looked for magical signs, but the answer might be more physical. And from the report I read, the Strigoi had trouble drinking ll - his blood.\" Dimitri had been about to say Lee, but had amended his choice out of respect for Clarence. The old man\u0027s dazed, happy look made it hard to tell if he understood what we were discussing at all.\\n\\n \"They complained about it,\" I agreed. \"But that didn\u0027t seem to stop them from drinking it.\" Strigoi could be forcibly created if a Strigoi drained a victim\u0027s blood and then fed Strigoi blood back to him or her. Lee had asked Strigoi to do this for him, but all draining him had achieved was death.\\n\\n \"We\u0027d like to take a sample of Dimitri\u0027s blood and then compare it to yours, Eddie,\" said Sonya. \"Blood can hold all sorts of magical properties, which might show us how to fight Strigoi.\"\\n\\n I kept my face as blank as possible, praying no one would notice me. Blood can hold all sorts of magical properties. Hopefully, in all this talk, no one would recall the mystery of why my blood was inexplicably revolting to Strigoi. And really, why should they? I\u0027d never been restored.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t a dhampir. There was no reason at all they\u0027d want me in these experiments.\\n\\n And yet, if that was true, why was I suddenly sweating?\\n\\n \"We can send it to a lab for the chemical part and try to read any magical properties off it too,\" Sonya continued. She sounded apologetic, but Eddie didn\u0027t look concerned.\\n\\n \"No problem,\" he said. \"Whatever you need.\" He meant it too, I knew. Losing blood was a million times easier for him than being inactive. Besides, he probably lost more blood in daily practice than he\u0027d even need to give up for this experiment.\\n\\n \"If you need another dhampir,\" said Angeline. \"You can use me too. Me and Eddie could help you. We\u0027d be a team. Sydney wouldn\u0027t have to keep coming along, especially now that she\u0027s got a boyfriend.\"\\n\\n There were so many things wrong with that, I didn\u0027t know where to start. The confidence Eddie had shown over giving blood vanished at \"we\u0027d be a team.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll consider it,\" said Sonya. There was a sparkle in her eye, and I remembered her saying she could see affection in auras. Could she detect Angeline\u0027s crush? \"For now, I\u0027d rather not take you away from your schoolwork. It\u0027s less important for Eddie since he\u0027s already graduated, but you should keep up with it.\" Angeline looked unhappy about that.\\n\\n She\u0027d had a number of difficulties with her classes, not to mention some outright embarrassments -\\n\\n like when she\u0027d been asked to create a map of Central America and had shown up with one of Nebraska and Kansas. She put on a cocky face, but I knew Amberwood overwhelmed her sometimes.\\n\\n Jill joined us, looking bright and refreshed. Ideally, Moroi drank blood every day. They could survive on this twice-a-week schedule, but I\u0027d noticed that Jill grew tired and rundown the farther she got from feedings.\\n\\n \"Your turn, Adrian,\" she said.\\n\\n He was yawning and looked startled at being noticed. I don\u0027t think he\u0027d really been interested in Sonya\u0027s blood experiments. As he stood up, he glanced over at me. \"Will you walk with me a sec, Sage?\" Before I could even lodge my protest, he said, \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m not taking you to the feeding. I just want to ask you a quick question.\" I nodded and followed him out of the room. As soon as we were away from the others, I said, \"I do not want to hear any more \u0027witty\u0027 commentary on Brayden.\"\\n\\n \"My commentary\u0027s hilarious, not witty. But that\u0027s not what I wanted to talk about.\" He came to a halt in the hallway, outside what I suspected was Dorothy\u0027s room. \"So, it seems my old man\u0027s coming to San Diego on business next weekend.\"\\n\\n I leaned against the wall and crossed my arms, already getting a bad feeling about this.\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t know why I\u0027m here, of course, or that I\u0027m with Jill. He doesn\u0027t even know what city I\u0027m in. He just thinks I\u0027m partying in California, up to no good as usual.\" I wasn\u0027t surprised that Mr. Ivashkov wouldn\u0027t know the true reason for Adrian being here. Jill\u0027s \"resurrection\" was top secret, as were her whereabouts. We couldn\u0027t risk any extra people - not even someone who might not mean her harm - finding out where she was.\\n\\n What did surprise me was that Adrian was working so hard to act like he didn\u0027t care what his father thought - but he obviously did. Adrian\u0027s face was convincing, but there was a note of bitterness in his voice that gave him away. \"Anyway,\" Adrian continued, \"he said he\u0027d meet me for lunch if I wanted. Normally, I\u0027d blow it off... but I\u0027d kind of like to know what\u0027s going on with my mom - they never tell me when I call or e-mail.\" Again, I picked up mixed emotions from him. Adrian\u0027s mother was serving time in a Moroi prison for crimes of intrigue. You wouldn\u0027t know it by his cocky attitude and sense of humor, but it must have been hard on him.\\n\\n \"Let me guess,\" I said. \"You want to borrow my car.\" I was sympathetic to those with difficult fathers, even Adrian. But my compassion only went so far and didn\u0027t extend to Latte. I couldn\u0027t risk any dents. Besides, the idea of being stuck without any way to get around scared me, especially when vampires were involved.\\n\\n \"No way,\" he said. \"I know better than that.\"\\n\\n He did? \"Then what do you want?\" I asked, surprised.\\n\\n \"I was hoping you\u0027d drive me.\"\\n\\n I groaned. \"Adrian, it takes two hours to get there.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s pretty much a straight shot down the highway,\" he pointed out. \"And I figured you\u0027d drive a four-hour round-trip before giving up your car to someone else.\" I eyed him. \"That\u0027s true.\"\\n\\n He took a step closer, a disconcertingly earnest expression all over his face. \"Please, Sage. I know it\u0027s a lot to ask, so I\u0027m not even going to pretend you\u0027d benefit. I mean, you can spend the day in San Diego doing whatever you want. It\u0027s not the same as going to see solar panels or whatever with Brady, but I\u0027d owe you - literally and figuratively. I\u0027ll pay you gas money.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Brayden, and where in the world would you get gas money?\" Adrian lived on a very tight allowance his father gave him. It was part of why Adrian was taking college classes, in the hopes that he\u0027d get financial aid next semester and have a bit more of an income. I admired that, though if we were all actually still in Palm Springs come January, it\u0027d mean the Moroi had some serious political problems.\\n\\n \"I... I\u0027d cut back on things to come up with the extra money,\" he said after a few moments of hesitation.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t bother hiding my surprise. \"Things\" most likely meant alcohol and cigarettes, which was where his meager allowance usually went. \"Really?\" I asked. \"You\u0027d give up drinking to go see your dad?\"\\n\\n \"Well, not permanently,\" he said. \"That\u0027d be ridiculous. But maybe I could switch to something slightly cheaper for a while. Like... slushes. Do you know how much I love those?\\n\\n Cherry, especially.\"\\n\\n \"Um, no,\" I said. Adrian was easily distractible by wacky topics and shiny objects. \"They\u0027re pure sugar.\"\\n\\n \"Pure deliciousness, you mean. I haven\u0027t had a good one in ages.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re getting off topic,\" I pointed out.\\n\\n \"Oh. Right. Well, whether I have to go on a slush-based diet or whatever, you\u0027ll get your money. And that\u0027s the other reason... I\u0027m kind of hoping the old man might agree to up my income.\\n\\n You probably don\u0027t believe it, but I hate always borrowing from you. It\u0027s easy for my dad to dodge phone calls, but face-to-face? He can\u0027t escape. Plus, he thinks it\u0027s more \u0027manly\u0027\\n\\n and \u0027respectable\u0027 to ask for something directly. Classic Nathan Ivashkov honor.\" Once again, the bitterness. Maybe a little anger. I studied Adrian for a long time as I thought about my next response. The hall was dim, giving him the advantage. He could probably see me perfectly while some details were more difficult for me. Those green, green eyes I so often admired in spite of myself simply looked dark now. The pain on his face, however, was all too apparent. He hadn\u0027t yet learned to hide his feelings from Jill and the bond, but I knew he kept that lazy, devil-may-care attitude on for the rest of the world - well, for everyone except me lately. This wasn\u0027t the first time I\u0027d seen him vulnerable, and it seemed weird to me that I, of all people, was the one he kept baring his emotions to. Or was it weird? Maybe this was just my social ineptitude confusing me again. Regardless, it pulled at something within me.\\n\\n \"Is that really what this is about? The money?\" I asked, tucking my other questions aside.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t like him. There has to be something more here.\"\\n\\n \"The money\u0027s a big part. But I meant what I said earlier... about my mom. I need to know how she is, and he won\u0027t tell me about her. Honestly, I think he just wants to pretend it never happened - either for that reputation of his or maybe... maybe because it hurts him. I don\u0027t know, but like I said, he can\u0027t dodge if I\u0027m right there. Plus...\" Adrian glanced away a moment before mustering the courage to meet my eyes again. \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s stupid. But I thought... well, maybe he\u0027d be impressed that I was sticking to college this time. Probably not, though.\"\\n\\n My heart ached for him, and I suspected that last part - earning his dad\u0027s approval - was bigger than Adrian was letting on. I knew all about what it was like to have a father who continually judged, whom nothing was ever good enough for. I understood as well the warring emotions... how one day you could say you didn\u0027t care, yet be yearning for approval the next.\\n\\n And I certainly understood motherly attachment. One of the hardest parts of being in Palm Springs was the distance from my mom and sisters.\\n\\n \"Why me?\" I blurted out. I hadn\u0027t meant to touch on those earlier questions, but I suddenly couldn\u0027t help myself. There was too much tension here, too much emotion. \"You could\u0027ve asked Sonya or Dimitri to drive you. They probably would\u0027ve even let you borrow their rental car.\"\\n\\n The ghost of a smile flashed across Adrian\u0027s face. \"I don\u0027t know about that. And I think you know why I don\u0027t want to risk being trapped in a car with our Russian friend. As for the rest... I don\u0027t know, Sage. There\u0027s something about you... you don\u0027t judge like the others. I mean, you do. You\u0027re more judgmental than any of them in some ways. But there\u0027s an honesty to it. I feel...\" The smile left his face as he faltered for words. \"Comfortable around you, I guess.\" There was no way I could stand against that, though I find it ironic he was allegedly most comfortable around me when Moroi gave me panic attacks half the time. You don\u0027t have to help, an inner voice warned me. You don\u0027t owe him anything. You don\u0027t owe any Moroi anything that isn\u0027t absolutely necessary. Have you forgotten Keith? This isn\u0027t a part of your job.\\n\\n The bunker came back to me, and I recalled how one vampire deal had landed Keith in Reeducation.\\n\\n How much worse was I? Social interaction was an inevitable part of this assignment, but I was blurring all the lines around it again.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll do it. E-mail me what time you need to leave.\" That\u0027s when the funniest part came. He looked totally floored. \"Really?\" I couldn\u0027t help but laugh. \"You gave me that whole pitch and didn\u0027t really think I\u0027d agree, did you?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he admitted, still clearly amazed. \"I can\u0027t always tell with you. I cheat with people, you know. I mean, I\u0027m good at reading faces, but I pick up a lot from auras and act like I just have amazing insight. I haven\u0027t learned to totally understand humans, though. You\u0027ve got the same colors but a different feel.\"\\n\\n Auras didn\u0027t weird me out as much as other vampire magic, but I still wasn\u0027t entirely comfortable with them. \"What color is mine?\"\\n\\n \"Yellow, of course.\"\\n\\n \"Of course?\"\\n\\n \"Smart, analytic types usually have yellow. You\u0027ve got a little purple here and there, though.\" Even in the dimness, I could see a mischievous spark in his eyes. \"That\u0027s what makes you interesting.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s purple mean?\"\\n\\n Adrian put his hand on the door. \"Gotta go, Sage. Don\u0027t want to keep Dorothy waiting.\"\\n\\n \"Come on. Tell me what purple is.\" I was so curious, I nearly grabbed his arm.\\n\\n He turned the knob. \"I will if you want to join us.\"\\n\\n \"Adrian - \"\\n\\n Laughing, he disappeared inside the room and shut the door. With a shake of my head, I started to return to the others and then decided to seek out my Diet Coke after all. I lingered with it in the kitchen for a while, leaning against the granite countertops and staring absentmindedly at the brilliant copper pots hanging from the ceiling. Why had I agreed to drive Adrian?\\n\\n What was it about him that managed to crack all the propriety and logic I built my life around? I understood why I often had a soft spot for Jill. She reminded me of my younger sister, Zoe. But Adrian? He wasn\u0027t like anyone I knew. In fact, I was fairly certain there was no one in the entire world quite like Adrian Ivashkov.\\n\\n I delayed so long that when I returned to the living room, Adrian was on his way back too.\\n\\n I sat down on the couch, nursing the last of my Diet Coke. Sonya brightened upon seeing me.\\n\\n \"Sydney, we just had a wonderful idea.\"\\n\\n Maybe I wasn\u0027t always the quickest in picking up social cues, but I did notice this wonderful idea was addressed to me, and not Adrian and me.\\n\\n \"We were just talking about the reports from the night of the... incident.\" She gave Clarence a meaningful look, and I nodded in understanding. \"Both the Moroi and the Alchemists said the Strigoi had trouble with your blood too, correct?\" I stiffened, not liking this at all. It was a conversation I\u0027d lived in fear of. The Strigoi who\u0027d killed Lee hadn\u0027t just had \"trouble\" with my blood. Lee\u0027s had tasted strange to them. Mine had been disgusting. The one who\u0027d tried to drink from me hadn\u0027t been able to tolerate it at all.\\n\\n She\u0027d even spit it out.\\n\\n \"Yes...\" I said carefully.\\n\\n \"Obviously, you\u0027re not a restored Strigoi,\" said Sonya. \"But we\u0027d like to take a look at your blood too. Maybe there\u0027s something about it that could help us. A small sample should suffice.\" All eyes were on me, even Clarence\u0027s. The room started to close in as a familiar panic filled me. I had thought a lot about why the Strigoi hadn\u0027t liked my blood - actually, I\u0027d tried to avoid thinking about it. I didn\u0027t want to believe there was anything special about me. There couldn\u0027t be. I didn\u0027t want to attract anyone\u0027s attention. It was one thing to facilitate these experiments and another to actually be a subject. If they wanted me for one test, they might want me for something else. And then something else. I\u0027d end up locked away, poked and prodded.\\n\\n There was also the fact that I just didn\u0027t want to give up my blood. It didn\u0027t matter that I liked Sonya and Dimitri. It didn\u0027t matter that the blood would be drawn with a needle, not teeth. The basic concept was still there, a taboo stemming from the most rudimentary of Alchemist beliefs: giving blood to vampires was wrong. It was my blood. Mine. No one - especially vampires - had any business with it.\\n\\n I swallowed, hoping I didn\u0027t look like I wanted to bolt. \"It was only one Strigoi\u0027s opinion.\\n\\n And you know they don\u0027t like humans as well as... you guys.\" That was part of why the Moroi lived in such fear and had seen their numbers reduced over time. They were the creme de la creme of Strigoi cuisine. \"That\u0027s probably all it was.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" said Sonya. \"But there\u0027s no harm done in checking.\" Her face was alight with this new idea. I hated turning her down... but my principles on this matter were too strong. It was everything I\u0027d been raised to believe.\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s a waste of time,\" I said. \"We know spirit has to be involved, and I have no connection to that.\"\\n\\n \"I do think it would be helpful,\" she said. \"Please.\"\\n\\n Helpful? From her point of view, yes. She wanted to rule out every possibility. But my blood had nothing to do with Strigoi conversions. It couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"I... I\u0027d rather not.\" A tame response, considering the emotions churning inside me. My heart was starting to race, and the walls were still closing in on me. My anxiety increased as I was visited by an old feeling, the awful realization that I was outnumbered here at Clarence\u0027s.\\n\\n That it was me and a roomful of vampires and dhampirs. Unnatural creatures. Unnatural creatures who wanted my blood...\\n\\n Dimitri studied me curiously. \"It won\u0027t hurt, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re afraid of. We don\u0027t need any more than what a doctor would take.\"\\n\\n I shook my head adamantly. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Both Sonya and I have training in this sort of thing,\" he added, trying to reassure me.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to worry about - \"\\n\\n \"She said no, okay?\"\\n\\n All the eyes that had been on me suddenly jerked toward Adrian. He leaned forward, fixing his gaze on Sonya and Dimitri, and I saw something in those pretty eyes I\u0027d never seen before: anger. They were like emerald fire.\\n\\n \"How many times does she have to refuse?\" Adrian demanded. \"If she doesn\u0027t want to, then that\u0027s all there is to it. This has nothing to do with her. This is our science project. She\u0027s here to protect Jill and has plenty to do there. So stop harassing her already!\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Harassing\u0027 is kind of a strong word,\" Dimitri said, calm in the face of Adrian\u0027s outburst.\\n\\n \"Not when you keep pushing someone who wants to be left alone,\" countered Adrian. He shot me a concerned look before fixing his anger back on Sonya and Dimitri. \"Stop ganging up on her.\"\\n\\n Sonya glanced uncertainly between us. She looked legitimately hurt. As astute as she was, I don\u0027t think she\u0027d realized how much this bothered me. \"Adrian... Sydney... we aren\u0027t trying to upset anyone. We just really want to get to the bottom of this. I thought all of you did too. Sydney\u0027s always been so supportive.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" growled Adrian. \"Take Eddie\u0027s blood. Take Belikov\u0027s blood. Take your own for all I care. But if she doesn\u0027t want to give hers, then that\u0027s all there is to it. She said no.\\n\\n This conversation is done.\" Some distant part of me noticed that this was the first time I\u0027d ever seen Adrian stand up to Dimitri. Usually, Adrian simply tried to ignore the other man - and hoped to be ignored in return.\\n\\n \"But - \" began Sonya.\\n\\n \"Let it go,\" said Dimitri. His expression was always difficult to read, but there was a gentleness in his voice. \"Adrian\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n Unsurprisingly, the room was a little tense after that.\\n\\n There were a few halting attempts at small talk that I hardly noticed. My heart was still in overtime, my breath still coming fast. I worked hard to calm down, reassuring myself that the conversation was done, that Sonya and Dimitri weren\u0027t going to interrogate me or forcibly drain my blood. I dared a peek at Adrian. He no longer looked angry, but there was still a fierceness there. It was almost... protective. A strange, warm feeling swirled in my chest, and for a brief moment, when I looked at him, I saw... safety. That wasn\u0027t usually the first sentiment I had around him. I shot him what I hoped was a grateful look. He gave me a small nod in return.\\n\\n He knows, I realized. He knows how I feel about vampires. Of course, everyone knew. Alchemists made no secret about how we believed most vampires and dhampirs were dark creatures who had no business interacting with humans. Because I was with them so often, however, I didn\u0027t think my cohort here in Palm Springs really understood how deeply that belief ran. They understood it in theory but didn\u0027t really feel it. They had no reason to since they hardly ever saw any evidence of it in me.\\n\\n But Adrian understood. I didn\u0027t know how, but he did. I thought back on the handful of times I\u0027d freaked out around them since being in Palm Springs. Once had been at a mini-golf course when Jill had used her water magic. Another time had been with the Strigoi and Lee, when Adrian had offered to heal me with his magic. Those were small lapses of control for me, ones none of the others had even noticed. Adrian had.\\n\\n How was it that Adrian Ivashkov, who never seemed to take anything seriously, was the only one among these \"responsible\" people who had paid attention to such small details?\\n\\n How was he the only one to really understand the magnitude of what I was feeling?\\n\\n When the time came to leave, I drove Adrian home along with the rest of us Amberwood students. More silence persisted in the car. Once Adrian had been dropped off, Eddie relaxed and shook his head.\\n\\n \"Man. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen Adrian so mad. Actually, I\u0027ve never seen Adrian mad at all.\"\\n\\n \"He wasn\u0027t that mad,\" I said evasively, eyes on the road.\\n\\n \"He seemed pretty mad to me,\" said Angeline. \"I thought he was going to jump up and attack Dimitri.\"\\n\\n Eddie scoffed. \"I don\u0027t think it was going to quite reach that point.\"\\n\\n \"I dunno,\" she mused. \"I think he was ready to take on anyone who messed with you, Sydney.\"\\n\\n I continued staring ahead, refusing to look at any of them. The whole encounter had left me feeling confused. Why had Adrian protected me? \"I offered to do him a favor next weekend,\" I said. \"I think he feels like he owes me.\"\\n\\n Jill, sitting beside me in the passenger seat, had been quiet thus far. With the bond, she might know the answer. \"No,\" she said, a puzzled note in her voice. \"He would have done it for you regardless.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-golden-lily-bloodlines-2/page-6.html","bookId":2042,"book":{"id":2042,"title":"The Golden Lily (Bloodlines #2)","description":"Storyline: The book follows Sydney Sage, a young Alchemist that is forced to hide inside a ritzy boarding school in Palm Springs, California so that she can protect Jill Dragomir, a Moroi princess.
