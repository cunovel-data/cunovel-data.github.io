{"id":71699,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The ships came swarming out of space in perfect coordination. An entire wing struck directly at the Observatory. In response to this, almost inevitably, the defending forces on Ceres concentrated their power at that point.\n The attack was not pressed full-force. Ship after ship dived downward to launch energy beams at an obviously impregnable shield. None took the risky step of trying to blast the underground power plants, the location of which they must have known. Government ships took to space and ground batteries opened up. In the end two pirate ships were destroyed when their shields broke down and they flared into glowing vapor. Another one, its energy reserves down to a trickle, was almost captured in the eventual pursuit. It was blown up at the last moment, probably by its own crew.\n Even during the attack some of the defenders suspected it to be a feint. Later, of course, they knew that for a fact. While the Observatory was engaged, three ships landed on the asteroid a hundred miles away. Pirates disembarked and with hand weapons and portable blasting cannon attacked the residential air-locks from flitting \"space-sleds.\"\n The locks were blasted open and space-suited pirates swarmed down the corridors from which air emptied. The upper reaches of the corridors were factories and offices, the occupants of which had evacuated at the first alarm. Their place was taken by space-suited members of the local militia who fought bravely, but were no match for the professionals of the pirate fleet.\n In the lower depths, in the peaceful apartments of Ceres, the noise of blasting battle sounded. Calls for help were sent out. Then, almost as suddenly as they came, the pirates retreated.\n When they left, the men of Ceres counted their casualties. Fifteen Cereans were dead and many more hurt in one way or another, as against the bodies of five pirates. Damage to property was very high.\n \"And one man,\" Conway explained furiously to Lucky when the latter arrived, \"is missing. Only he\u0027s not on the list of inhabitants and we\u0027ve been able to keep his name out of the news reports.\"\n Lucky found Ceres the focus of almost hysterical excitement now that the raid was over. It had been the first attack on an important Terrestrial center by any enemy in a generation. He had had to pass three inspections before being allowed to land.\n He sat in the Council office with Conway and Henree and said bitterly, \"So Hansen is gone! That\u0027s what it boils down to.\"\n \"I\u0027ll say this for the old hermit,\" said Henree. \"He had guts. When the pirates penetrated, he insisted on getting into a suit, grabbing up a blaster, and going up there with the militia.\"\n \"We weren\u0027t short on militia,\" said Lucky. \"If he had stayed down here, he would have done us a much greater service. How is it you didn\u0027t stop him? Under the circumstances was he a person to be allowed to do such a thing?\" Lucky Starr\u0027s usually even voice contained a repressed anger.\n Conway said patiently, \"We weren\u0027t with him. The guard we left in charge had to report for militia duty. Hansen insisted on joining him and the guard decided he could do both duties at once that way; fight the pirates and guard the hermit.\"\n \"But he didn\u0027t guard the hermit.\"\n \"Under the circumstances he can scarcely be blamed. The guard saw Hansen last charging a pirate. Next thing he knew there was no one in sight and the pirates were retreating. Hansen\u0027s body hasn\u0027t been recovered. The pirates must have him alive or dead.\"\n \"So they must,\" said Lucky. \"Now let me tell you something. Let me tell you exactly what a bad mistake this was. I\u0027m certain that the whole attack on Ceres was arranged simply to capture Hansen.\"\n Henree reached for his pipe. \"You know, Hector,\" he said to Conway, \"I\u0027m almost tempted to go along with Lucky on that. The attack on the Observatory was a miserable one, an obvious false alarm to draw off our defenses. Getting Hansen was the only thing they did accomplish.\"\n Conway snorted. \"One possible information leak like the hermit isn\u0027t worth risking thirty ships.\"\n \"That\u0027s the whole point,\" said Lucky vehemently. \"Right now, it may be. I told you about the asteroid I was on, the kind of industrial plant it must have been. Suppose they\u0027re almost at the point where they\u0027re ready to make the big push? Suppose Hansen knows the exact date for when the push is scheduled? Suppose he knows the exact method?\"\n \"Then why hasn\u0027t he told us?\" demanded Conway.\n \"Maybe,\" said Henree, \"he\u0027s waiting to use it as material with which to buy his own immunity. We never did have a chance really to discuss that question with him. You\u0027ve got to admit, Hector, that if he had that kind of key information, any number of ships would have been worth the risk. And you\u0027ve got to admit Lucky is probably right about their being ready for the big push.\"\n Lucky looked sharply from one to the other. \"Why do you say that, Uncle Gus? What\u0027s happened?\"\n \"Tell him, Hector,\" said Henree.\n \"Why tell him anything,\" growled Conway. \"I\u0027m tired of his one-man trips. He\u0027ll be wanting to go to Ganymede.\"\n \"What\u0027s on Ganymede?\" asked Lucky coldly. As far as he knew, there was little or nothing on Ganymede to interest anyone. It was Jupiter\u0027s largest moon, but the very nearness of Jupiter made it difficult to maneuver space-ships, so that space travel in its vicinity was unprofitable.\n \"Tell him,\" said Henree.\n \"Look,\" said Conway. \"Here it is. We knew Hansen was important. The reason we didn\u0027t have him under tighter observation, the reason Gus and I weren\u0027t there ourselves, was that two hours before the pirate attack a report came in from the Council to the effect that there was evidence that Sirian forces had landed on Ganymede.\"\n \"What kind of evidence?\"\n \"Tight-beam sub-etheric signals had been penetrated. It\u0027s a long story, but the nub of it was that, more by accident than by anything else, a few scraps of code were picked up. The experts say it\u0027s a Sirian code and certainly there isn\u0027t anything Terrestrial on Ganymede that\u0027s capable of putting out signals in a beam tliat tight. Gus and I were going to take Hansen and return to Earth when the pirates attacked, and that\u0027s it. Right now we\u0027ve still got to return to Earth. With Sirius on the scene there may be war at any time.\"\n Lucky said, \"I see. Well, before we go to Earth, there\u0027s one thing I would like to check on. Do we have motion pictures of the pirate attack? I\u0027m supposing the defenses of Ceres weren\u0027t so disorganized that pictures weren\u0027t taken?\"\n \"They\u0027ve been taken. How do you expect them to help?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you after I\u0027ve seen them.\"\n Men in the uniform of the fleet, and wearing high-rank insignia, projected the top-secret motion pictures of what later became known in history as the \"Ceres Raid.\"\n \"Twenty-seven ships attacked the Observatory. Is that right?\" asked Lucky,\n \"Right,\" said a commander. \"No more than that.\"\n \"Good. Now let\u0027s see if I have the rest of the facts straight. Two of the ships were accounted for during the fight and a third during the pursuit. The remaining twenty-four got away, but you have one or more shots of each of them in retreat.\"\n The commander smiled. \"If you\u0027re implying that any of them landed on Ceres and are still hidden here, you\u0027re quite wrong.\"\n \"As far as those twenty-seven ships are concerned, perhaps. But three more ships did land on Ceres and their crew attacked the Massey Air-lock. Where are the pictures of those?\"\n \"Unfortunately we didn\u0027t get many of those,\" admitted the commander uncomfortably. \"It was a case of complete surprise. But we have pictures of them in retreat, too, and we showed you those.\"\n \"Yes, you did, and there were only two ships in those pictures. Eyewitnesses reported three as having landed.\"\n The commander said stiffly, \"And three took off and retreated. There\u0027s eyewitness evidence of that also.\"\n \"But you have pictures of only two?\"\n \"Well... yes.\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n Back in the office Conway said, \"Now what was that all about, Lucky?\"\n \"I thought Captain Anton\u0027s ship might be in an interesting place. The motion pictures proved it was.\"\n \"Where was it?\"\n \"Nowhere. That was what was interesting. His ship is the one pirate ship I would recognize, yet no ship faintly similar took part in the raid. This is strange because Anton must be one of their very best men or they wouldn\u0027t have sent him out after the Atlas. Or it would be strange if the truth wasn\u0027t that thirty ships attacked Ceres and we had pictures of only twenty-nine. The missing thirtieth was Anton!\"\n \"I could figure that out too,\" said Conway. \"What of it?\"\n Lucky said, \"The attack on the Observatory was a feint. That\u0027s admitted even by the defending ships, now. It was the three ships that attacked the air-lock that were important and they were under Anton\u0027s command. Two of those ships joined the rest of the squadron in their retreat, a feint within a feint. The third ship, Anton\u0027s own, the only one we didn\u0027t see, continued on with the main business of the day. It left on an entirely different trajectory. People saw it lift into space but it veered off so radically that our own ships, chasing the main body of enemy with all its might, never even caught it on film.\"\n Conway said unhappily, \"You\u0027re going to say that it\u0027s going to Ganymede.\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t it follow? The pirates, however well organized, can\u0027t attack Earth and its dependencies on their own. But they can put up an excellent diversionary fight. They can keep enough Terrestrial ships patrolling the endless asteroid belt to allow Sirian fleets to defeat the remainder. On the other hand, Sirius can\u0027t safely conduct a war eight light years away from their own planet unless they can count on major help from the asteroids. After all, eight light years amounts to forty-five trillion miles. Anton\u0027s ship is speeding to Ganymede to assure them of that help and to give the word to begin the war. Without warning, of course.\"\n \"If only,\" muttered Conway, \"we could have stumbled on their Ganymede base sooner.\"\n \"Even with the knowledge of Ganymede,\" said Henree, \"we would not have known the seriousness of the situation without Lucky\u0027s two trips into asteroid territory.\"\n \"I know. My apologies, Lucky. Meanwhile we have very little time to do anything. We\u0027ll have to strike at the heart instantly. A squadron of ships sent to the key asteroid Lucky has told us of-\"\n \"No,\" said Lucky. \"No good.\"\n \"Why do you say that?\"\n \"We don\u0027t want to start a war, even if it\u0027s with a victory. That\u0027s what they want to do. Look here, Uncle Hector, the pirate, Dingo, might have burned me down right there on the asteroid. Instead, he had orders to set me adrift in space. For a while I thought that was to make my death look like an accident. Now I feel it was intended to anger the Council. They were going to broadcast the fact they had killed a Councilman, not hide it, goading us into a premature attack. One of the reasons for the Ceres Raid might have been to insure an added provocation.\"\n \"And if we do start the war with a victory?\"\n \"Here on this side of the Sun? And leave Earth on the other side stripped of important units of the fleet? With Sirian ships waiting at Ganymede, also on the other side of the Sun? I predict that it would be a very costly victory. Our best bet is not to start a war, but to prevent one.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"Nothing will happen until Anton\u0027s ship reaches Ganymede. Suppose we intercept him and prevent the meeting-\"\n \"Interception is a long chance,\" said Conway doubtfully.\n \"Not if Z go. The Shooting Starr is faster and has better Ergometrics than any ship in the fleet.\"\n \"You go?\" cried Conway.\n \"It would be unsafe to send fleet units. The Sirians on Ganymede would have no way of being certain an attack wasn\u0027t heading their way. They\u0027d have to take counteraction and that would mean the very war we\u0027re trying to avoid. The Shooting Starr would look harmless to them. It would be one ship. They\u0027d stay put.\"\n Henree said, \"You\u0027re overeager, Lucky. Anton has a twelve-hour head start. Even the Shooting Starr can\u0027t make that up.\"\n \"You\u0027re wrong. It can. And once I catch them, Uncle Gus, I think I can force the asteroids into surrender. Without them Sirius won\u0027t attack and there\u0027ll be no war.\"\n They stared at him.\n Lucky said earnestly, \"I\u0027ve come back twice now.\"\n \"Each time by half a miracle,\" grumbled Conway.\n \"The other times I didn\u0027t know what I was tackling. I had to feel my way. This time I do know. I know exactly. Look, I\u0027ll warm up the Shooting Starr and make the necessary arrangements with the Ceres Observatory while that\u0027s taking place. You two can get on the sub-ether to Earth. Get the Co-ordinator to-\"\n Conway said, \"I can take care of that, son. I\u0027ve been dealing with government affairs before you were born. And Lucky, will you take care of yourself?\"\n \"Don\u0027t I always, Uncle Hector? Uncle Gus?\" He shook hands warmly and whirled away.\n Bigman scuffed the dust of Ceres disconsolately. He said, \"I\u0027ve got my suit on. Everything.\"\n \"You can\u0027t go, Bigman,\" said Lucky. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because I\u0027m taking a short cut to get to Ganymede.\"\n \"So what? What kind of a short cut?\"\n Lucky smiled tightly. \"I\u0027m cutting through the Sun!\"\n He walked out on to the field toward the Shooting Starr, leaving Bigman standing there, mouth open. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-pirates-of-the-asteroids-lucky-starr-2/page-14.html","bookId":1755,"book":{"id":1755,"title":"Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2) \n Twenty-five years before, Lucky Starr\u0027s parents had been destroyed during a pirate raid on the Terrestrial Empire.
