{"id":71690,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Pirates crowded the outer skin of the Atlas and of their own Sirian-designed ship. Some were standing, held by the magnetic field of their boots. Others had cast themselves loose for better viewing, maintaining their place by means of a short magnetic cable attached to the ship\u0027s hull. Fifty miles apart two metal-foil goal posts had been set. Not more than three feet square in their collapsed state aboard ship, they opened into a hundred feet either way of thin-beaten beryl-magnesium sheets. Undimmed and undamaged in the great emptiness of space, they were set spinning, and the flickering reflections of the sun on their gleaming surfaces sent beams that were visible for miles. \"You know the rules.\" Anton\u0027s voice was loud in Lucky\u0027s ears, and presumably in Dingo\u0027s ears as well. Lucky could make out the other\u0027s space-suited shape as a sunlit speck half a mile away. The lifeboat that had brought them here was racing away now, back toward the pirate ship. \"You know the rules,\" said Anton\u0027s voice. \"The one who gets pushed back to his own goal post is the loser. If neither gets pushed back, the one whose push-gun expires first is the loser. No time limit. No off-side. You have five minutes to get set. The push-gun can\u0027t be used till the word is given.\" No off-side, thought Lucky. That was the giveaway. Push duels as a legal sport could not take place more than a hundred miles from an asteroid at least fifty miles in diameter. This would place a definite, though small, gravitational pull on the players. It would not be enough to affect mobility. It would be enough, however, to rescue a contestant who found himself miles out in space with an expired push-gun. Even if not picked up by the rescue boat he had only to remain quiet and in a matter of hours or, at most, one or two days, he would drift back to the asteroid\u0027s surface. Here, on the other hand, there was no sizable asteroid within hundreds of thousands of miles. A real push would continue indefinitely. It would end, as likely as not, in the sun, long after the unlucky contestant had smothered to death when his oxygen gave out. Under such conditions it was usually understood that, when one contestant or another passed outside certain set limits, time was called until their return. Saying \"no off-side\" was saying \"to the death.\" Anton\u0027s voice came clear and sharp across the miles of space between himself and the radio receiver in Lucky\u0027s helmet. He said, \"Two minutes to go. Adjust body signals.\" Lucky brought his hand up and closed the switch set into his chest. The colored metal foil which had earlier been magnet-set into his helmet was spinning. It was a miniature goal post. Dingo\u0027s figure, a moment before merely a dim dot, now sprang into flickering ruddy hie. His own signal, Lucky knew, was a flashing green. And the goal posts were pure white. Even now a fraction of Lucky\u0027s mind was far away. He had tried to make one objection at the very beginning. He had said, \"Look, this all suits me, you understand. But while we\u0027re fooling around, a government patrol ship might-\" Anton barked contemptuously, \"Forget it. No patrol ship would have the guts to get this far into the rocks. We\u0027ve a hundred ships within call, a thousand rocks to hold us if we had to make a getaway. Get into your suit.\" A hundred ships! A thousand rocks! If true, the pirates had never yet shown their full hand. What was going on? \"One minute left!\" said Anton\u0027s voice through space. Grimly Lucky brought up his two push-guns. They were L-shaped objects connected by springy, gummed-f abric tubing to the doughnutlike gas cylinders (containing carbon dioxide liquid under great pressure) that had been adjusted about his waist. In the old days the connecting tubing had been metal mesh. But that, though stronger, had also been more massive and had added to the momentum and inertia of the guns. In push duels rapid aiming and firing was essential. Once a fluorinated silicone had been invented which could remain a flexible gum at space temperatures and yet not become tacky in the direct rays of the sun, the lighter tubing material was universally used. \"Fire when ready!\" cried Anton. One of Dingo\u0027s push-guns triggered for an instant. The liquid carbon dioxide of his gas cylinder bubbled into violent gas and spurted out through the push-gun\u0027s needlelike orifice. The gas froze into a line of tiny crystals within six inches of its point of emersion. Even in the half second allowed for release a line of crystals, miles long, had been formed. As they pushed out one way, Dingo was pushed in the other. It was a spaceship and its rocket blast in miniature. Three times the \"crystal line\" flashed and faded in the distance. It pointed into space directly away from Lucky, and each time Dingo gained speed toward Lucky. The actual state of affairs was deceptive. The only change visible to the eye was the slow brightening of Dingo\u0027s suit signal, but Lucky knew that the distance between them was closing with hurtling velocity. What Lucky did not know was the proper strategy to expect; the appropriate defense. He waited to let the other\u0027s offensive moves unfold. Dingo was large enough now to see as a humanoid shape with head and four limbs. He was passing to one side, and making no move to adjust his aim. He seemed content to bear far to Lucky\u0027s left. Lucky still waited. The chorus of confused cries that rang in his helmet had died down. They came from the open transmitters of the audience. Though these were too far away to see the contestants, they could still follow the passage of the body signals and the flashes of the carbon dioxide streams. They were expecting something, Lucky thought. It came suddenly. A blast of carbon dioxide, then another appeared to Dingo\u0027s right, and his line of flight veered toward the young Councilman\u0027s position. Lucky brought his push-gun up, ready to flash downward and avoid close quarters. The safest strategy, he thought, was to do just that, and to move as slowly and as little as possible otherwise, in order to conserve carbon dioxide. But Dingo\u0027s flight did not continue toward Lucky. He fired straight ahead of himself, a long streak, and began to recede. Lucky watched him, and only too late the streak of light met his eyes. The line of carbon dioxide that Dingo had last fired traveled forward, yes, but he had been moving leftward at the time and so it did likewise. The two motions together moved it directly toward Lucky and it struck his left shoulder bull\u0027s-eye. To Lucky it felt like a sharp blow pounding him. The crystals were tiny, but they extended for miles and they were traveling at miles per second. They all hit his suit in the space of what seemed a fraction of an eyelid\u0027s flicker. Lucky\u0027s suit trembled and the roar of the audience was in his ear. \"You got him, Dingo!\" \"What a blast!\" \"Straight toward goal post. Look at him!\" \"It was beautiful. Beautiful!\" \"Look at the joker spin!\" Underneath that there were murmurs that seemed, somehow, less exuberant. Lucky was spinning or, rather, it seemed to his eyes that the heavens and all the stars in it were spinning. Across the face plate of his helmet the stars were white streaks, as though they were sparkles of trillions of carbon dioxide crystals themselves. He could see nothing but the numerous blurs. For a moment it was as though the blow had knocked the power of thinking out of him. A blow in the midriff and one in the back sent him, still spinning, further on his hurtling way through space. He had to do something or Dingo would make a football of him from one end of the Solar System to the other. The first thing was to stop the spin and get his bearings. He was tumbling diagonally, left shoulder over right hip. He pointed the push-gun in the direction counter to that twist, and in lightning releases pumped out streams of carbon dioxide. The stars slowed until their turning was a stately march that left them sharply defined points. The sky became the familiar sky of space. One star flickered and was too bright. Lucky knew it to be his own goal post. Almost diametrically opposed was the angry red of Dingo\u0027s body signal. Lucky could not fling himself backward beyond the goal post or the duel would be over and he would have lost. Beyond the goal post and within a mile of it was the standard rule for a goal ending. Nor, on the other hand, could he afford to get closer to his opponent. He brought his push-gun straight up over his head, closed contact, and held it so. He counted a full minute before he released contact, and through all the sixty seconds he felt the pressure against the top of his helmet as he accelerated downward. It was a desperate maneuver, for he threw away a half hour\u0027s supply of gas in that one minute. Dingo, in outrage, yelled hoarsely, \"You flumstered coward! You yellow mugger!\" The cries of the audience also rose to a crescendo. \"Look at him run.\" \"He got past Dingo. Dingo, get him.\" \"Hey, Williams. Put up a fight.\" Lucky saw the crimson blur of his enemy again. He had to keep on the move. There was nothing else he could do. Dingo was an expert and could hit a one-inch meteorite as it flashed by. He himself, Lucky thought ruefully, would do well to hit Ceres at a mile. He used his push-guns alternately. To the left, to the right; then quickly, to the right, to the left and to the right again. It made no difference. It was as though Dingo could foretell his moves, cut across the corners, move in inexorably. Lucky felt the perspiration beading out upon his forehead, and suddenly he was aware of the silence. He could not remember the exact moment it had come, but it had come like the breaking of a thread. One moment there had been the yells and laughter of the pirates, and the next moment only the dead silence of space where sound could never be heard. Had he passed beyond range of the ships? Impossible! Suit radios, even the simplest type, would carry thousands of miles in space. He pushed the sensitivity dial on his chest to maximum. \"Captain Anton!\" But it was Dingo\u0027s rough voice that answered. \"Don\u0027t yell. I hear you.\" Lucky said, \"Call time! There\u0027s something wrong with my radio.\" Dingo was close enough to be made out as a human figure again. A flashing line of crystals and he was closer. Lucky moved away, but the pirate followed on his heels. \"Nothing wrong,\" said Dingo. \"Just a gimmicked radio. I\u0027ve been waiting. I\u0027ve been waiting. I could have knocked you past goal long ago, but I\u0027ve been waiting for the radio to go. It\u0027s just a little transistor I gimmicked before you put on your suit. You can still talk to me, though. It\u0027ll still carry a mile or two. Or at least you can talk to me for a little while.\" He relished the joke and barked l^is laughter. Lucky said, \"I don\u0027t get it.\" Dingo\u0027s voice turned harshly cruel. \"You caught me on the ship with my blaster in its holster. You trapped me there. You made me look like a fool. No one traps me and I don\u0027t let anyone make a fool out of me in front of the captain and live very long after that. I\u0027m not goaling you for someone else to finish. I\u0027m finishing you here! Myself!\" Dingo was much closer. Lucky could almost make out the face behind the thick glassite of the face plate. Lucky abandoned attempts at bobbing and weaving. That would lead, he decided, to being consistently out-maneuvered. He considered straight flight, pushing outward at increasing velocity as long as his gas held out. But then afterward? And was he going to be content to die while running away? He would have to fight back. He aimed the push-gun at Dingo, and Dingo wasn\u0027t there when the line of crystals passed through the spot where a moment before he had been. He tried again and again, but Dingo was a flitting demon. And then Lucky felt the hard impact of the other\u0027s push-gun blast and he was spinning again. Desperately he tried to come out of the spin and before he could do so, he felt the clanging force of a body\u0027s collision with his. Dingo held his suit in tight embrace. Helmet to helmet. Face plate to face plate. Lucky was staring at the white scar splitting Dingo\u0027s upper lip. It spread tightly as Dingo smiled. \"Hello, chum,\" he said. \"Pleased to meet you.\" For a moment Dingo floated away, or seemed to, as he loosened the grip of his arms. The pirate\u0027s thighs held firm about Lucky\u0027s knees, their apelike strength immobilizing him. Lucky\u0027s own whipcord muscles wrenched this way and that uselessly. Dingo\u0027s partial retreat had only been designed to free his arms. One lifted high, push-gun held butt-first. It came down directly on the face plate and Lucky\u0027s head snapped back with the sudden, shattering impact. The relentless arm swung up again, while the other curled about Lucky\u0027s neck. \"Hold your head still,\" the pirate snarled. \"I\u0027m finishing this.\" Lucky knew that to be the literal truth unless he acted quickly. The glassite was strong and tough, but it would hold out only so long against the battering of metal. He brought up the heel of his gauntleted hand against Dingo\u0027s helmet, straightening his arm and pushing the pirate\u0027s head back. Dingo rocked his head to one side, disengaging Lucky\u0027s arm. He brought the butt of his push-gun down a second time. Lucky dropped both push-guns, let them dangle from their connecting tubes, and with a sure movement snatched at the connecting tubes of Dingo\u0027s guns. He threaded them between the fingers of his steel gloves. The muscles of his arms lumped and tightened painfully. His jaws clenched and he felt the blood creep to his temples. Dingo, his mouth twisted in fierce joyful anticipation, disregarded everything but the upturned face of his victim behind the transparent face plate, contorted, as he thought, with fear. Once more the butt came down. A small cracking star appeared where the metal had struck. Then something else gave and the universe seemed to go mad. First one and, almost immediately afterward, the other of the connecting tubes of Dingo\u0027s two push-guns parted and an uncontrollable stream of carbon dioxide ravened out of each broken tube. The tubes whipped like insane snakes, and Lucky was slammed against his suit first this way, then that, in violent reaction to the mad and uncontrolled acceleration. Dingo yelled in jolted surprise and his grip loosened. The two almost separated, but Lucky held on grimly to one of the pirate\u0027s ankles. The carbon dioxide stream slackened and Lucky went up his opponent\u0027s leg hand over hand. They were apparently motionless now. The chance whippings of the stream had left them even without any perceptible spin. Dingo\u0027s push-gun tubes, now dead and flaccid, stretched out in their last position. All seemed still, as still as death. But that was a delusion. Lucky knew they were traveling at miles per second in whatever direction that last stroke of gas had sent them. They were alone and lost in space, the two of them.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-pirates-of-the-asteroids-lucky-starr-2/page-5.html","bookId":1755,"book":{"id":1755,"title":"Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2)","description":"Storyline: Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2) Twenty-five years before, Lucky Starr\u0027s parents had been destroyed during a pirate raid on the Terrestrial Empire.
