A dozen of his men in every stage of space-suit undress had crowded into the room, watching and listening with gaping interest.\\n\\n He reddened slightly. His voice rose. \"Get on your business, scum. I want a complete report on this ship. And keep your weapons ready. There may be more men on board and if anyone else gets caught as Dingo did, he\u0027ll be tossed out an air-lock.\"\\n\\n There was slow, shuffling motion outward.\\n\\n Anton\u0027s voice was a sudden scream. \"Quickly! Quickly!\" One snaking gesture, and a blaster was in his hand. \"I\u0027ll count three and shoot. One... two...\"\\n\\n They were gone.\\n\\n He faced Lucky again. His eyes glittered and his breath came and went quickly through pinched white nostrils.\\n\\n \"Discipline is a great thing,\" he breathed. \"They must fear me. They must fear me more than they fear capture by the Terrestrial Navy. Then a ship is one mind and one arm. My mind and arm.\"\\n\\n Yes, thought Lucky, one mind and one arm, but whose? Yours?\\n\\n Anton\u0027s smile had returned, boyish, friendly, and open. \"Now tell me what you want.\"\\n\\n Lucky jerked a thumb toward the other\u0027s blaster, still drawn and ready. He matched the other\u0027s smile. \"Do you intend shooting? If so, get it over with.\"\\n\\n Anton was shaken. \"Space! You\u0027re a cool one. I\u0027ll shoot when I please. I like it this way. What\u0027s your name?\" The blaster held on its line with deadly steadiness.\\n\\n \"Williams, Captain.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a tall man, Williams. You look strong. And yet here I sit and with just a pressure of my thumb you\u0027re dead. I think it\u0027s very instructive. Two men and one blaster is the whole secret of power. Did you ever think of power, Williams?\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the only meaning to life, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\"\\n\\n \"I see you\u0027re anxious to do business. Let\u0027s begin. Why are you here?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard of pirates.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re the men of the asteroids, Williams. No other name.\"\\n\\n \"That suits me. I\u0027ve come to join the men of the asteroids.\"\\n\\n \"You flatter us, but my thumb is still on the blaster contact. Why do you want to join?\"\\n\\n \"Life is closed on Earth, Captain. A man like myself could settle down to be an accountant or an engineer. I might even run a factory or sit behind a desk and vote at stockholders\u0027 meetings. It doesn\u0027t matter. Whatever it is, it would be routine. I would know my life from beginning to end. There would be no adventure, no uncertainty.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a philosopher, Williams. Go on.\"\\n\\n \"There are the colonies, but I\u0027m not attracted by a life as a farm boy on Mars or as a vat tender on Venus. What does attract me is the Me on the asteroids. You live hard and dangerously. A man can rise to \"power as you have. As you say, power gives meaning to life.\"\\n\\n \"So you stow away on an empty ship?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know it was empty. I had-to stow away somewhere. Legitimate space passage comes high and passports to the asteroids aren\u0027t being handed out these days. I knew this ship was part of a mapping expedition. The word had got around. It was headed for the asteroids. So I waited till just before it blasted off. That\u0027s when everybody would be busy getting ready for take-off and yet the air-locks would still be open. I had a pal take a sentry out of circulation.\\n\\n \"I figured we\u0027d stop at Ceres. It would be bound to be Prime Base for any asteroid expedition. Once there, it seemed to me I could get off without trouble. The crew would be astronomers and mathematicians. Snatch off their glasses and they\u0027d be blind. Point a blaster at them and they\u0027d die of fright. Once on Ceres I\u0027d contact the pi-The men of the asteroids, somehow. Simple.\"\\n\\n \"Only you got a surprise when you boarded ship? Is that it?\" asked Anton.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll say. No one aboard and before I could get it straight in my mind that there wasn\u0027t anyone aboard, it blasted off.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s it all about, Williams? How do you figure it?\" \"I don\u0027t. It beats me.\"\\n\\n \"Well, let\u0027s see if we can find out. You and I together.\" He gestured with his blaster and said sharply, \"Come on\".\\n\\n The pirate chief led the way out of the control room into the long central corridor of the ship. A group of men came out of a door up ahead. They rumbled short comments at one another and stilled into silence when they caught Anton\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n Anton said, \"Come here.\"\\n\\n They approached. One wiped a grizzled mustache with the back of his hand and said, \"No one else on board this ship, Captain.\"\\n\\n \"All right. What do you think of the ship?\"\\n\\n There were four of them. The number increased as more men joined the group.\\n\\n Anton\u0027s voice grew edgy. \"What do any of you think of the ship?\"\\n\\n Dingo pushed his way forward. He had got rid of his space-suit and Lucky could see him as a man. It was not altogether a pleasant sight. He was broad and heavy and his arms were slightly bowed as they hung loosely from bulging shoulders. There were tufts of dark hair on the back of his fingers and the scar on his upper lip twitched. His eyes glared at Lucky.\\n\\n He said, \"I don\u0027t like it.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t like the ship?\" Anton asked sharply.\\n\\n Dingo hesitated. He straightened his arms, threw back his shoulders. \"It stinks.\"\\n\\n \"Why? Why do you say that?\"\\n\\n \"I could take it apart with a can opener. Ask the rest and see if they don\u0027t agree with me. This crate is put together with toothpicks. It wouldn\u0027t hold together for three months.\"\\n\\n There were murmurs of agreement. The man with the gray mustache said, \"Beg your pardon, Captain, but the wiring is taped in place. It\u0027s a two-bit job. The insulation is almost burnt through already.\"\\n\\n \"All the welding was done in a real hurry,\" said another. \"The seams stand out like that.\" He held out a thick and dirty thumb.\\n\\n \"What about repairs?\" asked Anton.\\n\\n Dingo said, \"It would take a year and a Sunday. It isn\u0027t worth it. Anyway, we couldn\u0027t do it here. We\u0027d have to take it to one of the rocks.\"\\n\\n Anton turned to Lucky, explaining suavely, \"We always refer to the asteroids as \u0027rocks,\u0027 you understand.\"\\n\\n Lucky nodded.\\n\\n Anton said, \"Apparently my men feel that they wouldn\u0027t care to ride this ship. Why do you suppose the Earth government would send out an empty ship and such a jerry-built job to boot?\"\\n\\n \"It keeps getting more and more confusing,\" said Lucky.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s complete our investigation, then.\"\\n\\n Anton walked first. Lucky followed closely. The men tagged behind silently. The back of Lucky\u0027s neck prickled. Anton\u0027s back was straight and fearless, as though he expected no attack from Lucky. He might well feel so. Ten armed men were on Lucky\u0027s heels.\\n\\n They glanced through the small rooms, each designed for utmost economy in space. There was the computation room, the small observatory, the photographic laboratory, the galley and the bunk rooms.\\n\\n They slipped down to the lower level through a narrow curving tube within which the pseudo-grav field was neutralized so that either direction could be \"up\" or \"down\" at will. Lucky was motioned down first, Anton following so closely that Lucky barely had time to scramble out of the way (his legs buckling slightly with the sudden access of weight) before the pirate chief was upon him. Hard, heavy space-boots missed his face by inches.\\n\\n Lucky regained his balance and whirled angrily, but Anton was standing there smiling pleasantly, his blaster lined up straight and true at Lucky\u0027s heart.\\n\\n \"A thousand apologies,\" he said. \"Fortunately you are quite agile.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" muttered Lucky.\\n\\n On the lower level were the engine room and the power plant; the empty berths where the lifeboats had been. There were the fuels store, the food and water stores, the air fresheners, and the atomic shielding.\\n\\n Anton murmured, \"Well, what do you think of it all? Shoddy, perhaps, but I see nothing out of order.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hard to tell like this,\" said Lucky.\\n\\n \"But you must have lived on this ship for days.\"\\n\\n \"Sure, but I didn\u0027t spend time looking it over. I just waited for it to get somewhere.\"\\n\\n \"I see. Well, back to upper level.\"\\n\\n Lucky was first \"down\" the travel tube again. This time he landed lightly and sprang six feet to one side with the grace of a cat.\\n\\n Seconds passed before Anton popped out of the tube. \"Jumpy?\" he asked.\\n\\n Lucky flushed.\\n\\n One by one the pirates appeared. Anton did not wait for all of them, but started down the corridor again.\\n\\n \"You know,\" he said, \"you\u0027d think we\u0027d been all over this ship. Most people would say so. Wouldn\u0027t you say so?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Lucky calmly, \"I wouldn\u0027t. We haven\u0027t been in the washroom.\"\\n\\n Anton scowled and for more than just a moment the pleasantness was gone from his face, and only a tight, white anger flashed in its place.\\n\\n Then it passed. He adjusted a stray lock of hair on his head, then regarded the back of his hand with interest. \"Well, let\u0027s look there.\"\\n\\n Several of the men whistled and the rest exclaimed in a variety of ways when the appropriate door clicked open.\\n\\n \"Very nice,\" murmured Anton. \"Very nice. Luxurious, I would say.\"\\n\\n It was! There was no question of that. There were separate stall showers, three of them, with their plumbing arranged for sudsing water (hike-warm) and rinsing water (hot or cold). There were also half a dozen washbowls in ivory-chrome, with shampoo stands, hair driers and needle-jet skin stimulators. Nothing that was necessary was missing.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s certainly nothing shoddy about this,\" said Anton. \"It\u0027s like a show on the sub-etherics, eh, Williams? What do you make of this?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m confused.\"\\n\\n Anton\u0027s smile vanished like the fleeting flash of a speeding space-ship across a visiplate. \"I\u0027m not. Dingo, come in here.\"\\n\\n The pirate chief said to Lucky, \"It\u0027s a simple problem, you. We have a ship here with no one aboard, thrown together in the cheapest possible way, as though it were done in a hurry, but with a washroom that is the last word. Why? I think it\u0027s just in order to have as many pipes as possible in the washroom. And why that? So that we\u0027d never suspect that one or two of them were dummies... Dingo, which pipe is it?\"\\n\\n Dingo kicked one.\\n\\n \"Well, don\u0027t kick it, you misbegotten fool. Take it apart.\"\\n\\n Dingo did so, a micro-heatgun flashing briefly. He yanked out wires.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that, Williams?\" demanded Anton.\\n\\n \"Wires,\" said Lucky briefly.\\n\\n \"I know that, you lump.\" He was suddenly furious. \"What else? I\u0027ll tell you what else. Those wires are set to explode every ounce of the atomite on board ship as soon as we take the ship back to base.\"\\n\\n Lucky jumped. \"How can you tell that?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re surprised? You didn\u0027t know this was one big trap? You didn\u0027t know we were supposed to take this back to base for repairs? You didn\u0027t know we were supposed to explode ourselves and the base, too, into hot dust? Why, you\u0027re here as the bait to make sure we were-properly fooled. Only I\u0027m not a fool!\"\\n\\n His men were crowding close. Dingo licked his lips.\\n\\n With a snap Anton brought up his blaster and there was no mercy, no dream of mercy, in his eyes.\\n\\n \"Wait! Great Galaxy, wait! I know nothing about this. You have no right to shoot me without cause.\" He tensed for a jump, one last fight before death.\\n\\n \"No right!\" Anton, eyes glaring, lowered his blaster suddenly. \"How dare you say no right. I have all rights on this ship.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t kill a good man. The men of the asteroids need good men. Don\u0027t throw one away for nothing.\"\\n\\n A sudden, unexpected murmur came from some of the pirates.\\n\\n A voice said, \"He\u0027s got guts, Cap\u0027n. Maybe we could use-\"\\n\\n It died away as Anton turned.\\n\\n He turned back. \"What makes you a good man, Williams? Answer that and I\u0027ll consider.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll hold my own against anyone here. Bare fists or any weapon.\"\\n\\n \"So?\" Anton\u0027s teeth bared themselves. \"You hear that, men?\"\\n\\n There was an affirmative roar.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s your challenge, Williams. Any weapon. Good! Come out of this alive and you won\u0027t be shot. You\u0027ll be considered for membership in my crew.\"\\n\\n \"I have your word, Captain?\"\\n\\n \"You have my word, and I never break my word. The crew hears me. If you come out of this alive.\"\\n\\n \"Whom do I fight?\" demanded Lucky.\\n\\n \"Dingo here. A good man. Anyone who can beat him is a very good man.\"\\n\\n Lucky measured the huge lump of gristle and sinew standing before him, its little eyes glittering with anticipation, and glumly agreed with the captain.\\n\\n But he said firmly, \"What weapons? Or is it bare fists?\"\\n\\n \"Weapons! Push-tubes, to be exact. Push-tubes in open space.\"\\n\\n For a moment Lucky found it difficult to maintain an appropriate stolidity.\\n\\n Anton smiled. \"Are you afraid it won\u0027t be a proper test for you? Don\u0027t be. Dingo is the best man with a push-gun in our entire fleet.\"\\n\\n Lucky\u0027s heart plummeted. A push-gun duel required an expert. Notoriously so! Played as he had played it in college days, it was a sport. Fought by professionals, it was deadly!\\n\\n And he was no professional! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-pirates-of-the-asteroids-lucky-starr-2/page-4.html","bookId":1755,"book":{"id":1755,"title":"Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2)","description":"Storyline: Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2) \\n Twenty-five years before, Lucky Starr\u0027s parents had been destroyed during a pirate raid on the Terrestrial Empire.
