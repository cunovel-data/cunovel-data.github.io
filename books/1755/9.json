Conway was obviously speechless.\n \"It was necessary. I had to introduce myself to the pirates without suspicion. If they found me on what they thought was a mapping ship, they would have shot me out of hand. On the other hand, if they found me on a booby-trapped ship the secret of which they had stumbled on by what seemed a stroke of fortune, they would have taken me at face value as a stowaway. Don\u0027t you see? On a mapping ship I\u0027m only a member of the crew that didn\u0027t get away in time. On a booby trap, I\u0027m a poor jerk who didn\u0027t realize what he was stowing away on.\"\n \"They might have shot you anyway. They might have seen through your double-cross and considered you a spy. In fact, they almost did.\"\n \"True! They almost did,\" admitted Lucky.\n Conway finally exploded. \"And what about the original plan. Were we or were we not going to explode one of their bases? When I consider the months we spent on the construction of the Atlas, the money that went into it-\"\n \"What good would it have done to explode one of their bases? We spoke about a huge hangar of pirate ships, but actually that was only wishful thinking. An organization based upon the asteroids would have to be decentralized. The pirates probably don\u0027t have more than three or four ships in any one place. There wouldn\u0027t be room for more. Exploding three or four ships would mean very little compared with what would have been accomplished if I had succeeded in penetrating their organization.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t succeed,\" said Conway. \"With all your fool risks, you didn\u0027t succeed.\"\n \"Unfortunately the pirate captain who took the Atlas was too suspicious, or perhaps too intelligent for us. I\u0027ll try not to underestimate them again. But it\u0027s not all loss. We know for a fact that Sirius is behind them. In addition, we have my hermit friend.\"\n \"He won\u0027t help us,\" said Conway. \"From what you\u0027ve said about him, it sounds as though he were only interested in having as little to do with the pirates as possible. So what can he know?\"\n \"He may be able to tell us more than he himself thinks is possible,\" said Lucky coolly. \"For instance, there\u0027s one piece of information he can give us that will enable me to continue efforts at working against piracy from the inside.\"\n \"You\u0027re not going out there again,\" said Conway hastily.\n \"I don\u0027t intend to,\" said Lucky.\n Conway\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Where\u0027s Bigman?\"\n \"On Ceres. Don\u0027t worry. In fact,\" and a shadow crossed Lucky\u0027s face, \"he should be here by now. The delay is beginning to bother me a little.\"\n John Bigman Jones used his special pass card to get past the guard at the door to the Control Tower. He was muttering to himself as he half-ran along the corridors.\n The slight flush on his pug-nosed face dimmed his freckles and his reddish hair stood up in tufts like fence pickets. Lucky had frequently told him he cultivated a vertical hair-do to make himself look taller, but he always denied that vigorously.\n The final door to the Tower swung open as he broke the photoelectric beam. He stepped inside and looked about.\n Three men were on duty. One with earphones sat at the sub-etheric receiver, another was at the calculating machine and the third was at the curved radarized visi-plate.\n Bigman said, \"Which one of you knotbrains called me Shortie?\"\n The three turned toward him in unison, their faces startled and scowling.\n The man with the earphones pulled one away from his left ear. \"Who in space are you? How the dickens did you get in here?\"\n Bigman stood erect and puffed out his small chest. \"My name is John Bigman Jones. My friends call me Bigman. Everyone else calls me Mr. Jones. Nobody calls me Shortie and stays in one piece. I want to know which one of you made that mistake.\"\n The man with the earphones said, \"My name is Lem Fisk and you can call me anything you blame please as long as you do it somewhere else. Get out of here, or I\u0027ll come down, pick you up by one leg, and toss you out.\"\n The fellow at the calculating machine said, \"Hey, Lem, that\u0027s the crackpot who was haunting the port a while back. There\u0027s no point in wasting time on him. Get the guards to throw him out.\"\n \"Nuts,\" said Lem Fisk, \"we don\u0027t need guards for that\n guy.\" He took off his earphones altogether and set the sub-\n etherics at automatic signal. He said, \"Well, son, you came in here and asked us a nice question in a nice way. I\u0027ll give you a nice answer. I called you Shortie, but wait, don\u0027t get mad. I had a reason. You see you\u0027re such a real tall fellow. You\u0027re such a long drink of water. You\u0027re such a high-pockets. It makes my friends laugh to hear me call you Shortie.\"\n He reached into his hip pocket and drew out a plastic container of cigarettes. The smile on his face was bland.\n \"Come down here,\" yelled Bigman. \"Come down here and back up your sense of humor with a couple of fists.\"\n \"Temper, temper,\" said Fisk, clucking his tongue. \"Here, boy, have a cigarette. King-size, you know. Almost as long as you are. Liable to create some confusion, though, come to think of it. We won\u0027t be able to tell whether you\u0027re smoking the cigarette or the cigarette is smoking you.\"\n The other two Tower men laughed vigorously.\n Bigman was a passionate red. Words came thickly to his tongue. \"You won\u0027t fight?\"\n \"I\u0027d rather smoke. Pity you don\u0027t join me.\" Fisk leaned back, chose a cigarette, and held it before his face as though admiring its slim whiteness. \"After all, I can\u0027t be bothered to fight children.\"\n He grinned, brought his cigarette to his lips, and found them closing on nothingness.\n His thumb and first two fingers still held their positions about three eighths of an inch apart, but there was no cigarette between them.\n \"Watch out, Lem,\" cried the man at the visiplate. \"He has a needle-gun.\"\n \"No needle-gun,\" snarled Bigman. \"Just a buzzer.\"\n There was an important difference. A buzzer\u0027s projectiles, although needle-like, were fragile and nonexplo-sive. They were used for target practice and small game. Striking human skin, a buzz needle would do no serious damage, but it would smart like the devil.\n Fisk\u0027s grin disappeared completely. He yelled, \"Watch that, you crazy fool. You can blind a man with that.\"\n Bigman\u0027s fist remained clenched at eye level. The thin snout of the buzzer projected between his two middle fingers. He said, \"I won\u0027t blind you. But I can fix it so you won\u0027t sit down for a month. And as you can see, my aim isn\u0027t bad. And you,\" he called over his shoulder to the one at the calculator, \"if you move an inch closer to the alarm circuit, you\u0027ll have a buzz needle right through your hand.\"\n Fisk said, \"What do you want?\"\n \"Come down here and fight.\"\n \"Against a buzzer?\"\n \"I\u0027ll put it away. Fists. Fair fight. Your buddies can see to that.\"\n \"I can\u0027t hit a guy smaller than I am.\"\n \"Then you shouldn\u0027t insult him, either.\" Bigman brought up the buzzer. \"And I\u0027m not smaller than you are. I may look that way on the outside, but inside I\u0027m as big as you. Maybe bigger. I\u0027m counting three.\" He narrowed one eye as he aimed.\n \"Galaxy!\" swore Fisk. \"I\u0027m coming down. Fellas, be my witness that this was forced on me. I\u0027ll try not to hurt the crazy idiot too much.\"\n He leaped down from his perch. The man at the calculating machine took his place at the sub-etherics.\n Fisk was five feet ten, eight inches taller than Bigman, whose slight figure was more like a boy\u0027s than a man\u0027s. But Bigman\u0027s muscles were steel springs under perfect control. He awaited the other\u0027s approach without expression.\n Fisk did not bother to put up a guard. He simply extended his right hand as though he were going to lift Bigman by the collar and toss him through the still open door.\n Bigman ducked under the arm. His left and right thudded into the larger man\u0027s solar plexus in a rapid one-two, and almost in the same instant he danced out of reach.\n Fisk turned green and sat down, holding his stomach and groaning.\n \"Stand up, big boy,\" said Bigman. \"I\u0027ll wait for you.\"\n The other two Tower men seemed frozen into immobility by the sudden turn of events.\n Slowly Fisk rose to his feet. His face glowed with rage, but he approached more slowly.\n Bigman drifted away.\n Fisk lunged! Bigman was not there by two inches. Fisk whipped a sharp overhand right. It\u0027s thrust ended an inch short of Bigman\u0027s jaw.\n Bigman bobbed about like a cork on rippling water. His arms lifted occasionally to deflect a blow.\n Fisk, yelling incoherently, rushed blindly at his gnat-like opponent. Bigman stepped to one side and his open hand slapped sharply at the other\u0027s smooth-shaven cheek. It hit with a sharp report, like a meteor hitting the first layers of dense air above a planet. The marks of four fingers were outlined in red on Fisk\u0027s face.\n For a moment Fisk stood there, dazed. Like a striking snake, Bigman stepped in again, his fists moving upward to crack against Fisk\u0027s jaw. Fisk went down into a half crouch.\n Distantly Bigman was suddenly aware of the steady ringing of the alarm.\n Without a moment\u0027s hesitation he turned on his heel and was out the door. He wove through a startled trio of guards heading up the corridor at a clattering run, and was gone!\n \"And why,\" questioned Conway, \"are we waiting for Bigman?\"\n Lucky said, \"Here\u0027s the way I see the situation. There is nothing we need so badly as more information about the pirates. I mean inside information. I tried to get it and things didn\u0027t quite break the way I hoped they would. I\u0027m a marked man now. They know me. But they don\u0027t know Bigman. He has no official connection with the Council. Now it\u0027s my idea that if we can trump up a criminal charge against him, for realism, you know, he can hightail it out of Ceres in the hermit\u0027s ship-\"\n \"Oh, space,\" groaned Conway.\n \"Listen, will you! He\u0027ll go back to the hermit\u0027s asteroid. If the pirates are there, good! If not, he\u0027ll leave the ship in plain view and wait for them inside. It\u0027s a very comfortable place to wait in.\"\n \"And when they come,\" said Henree, \"they\u0027ll shoot him.\"\n \"They will not. That\u0027s why he\u0027s taking the hermit\u0027s ship. They\u0027ll have to know where Hansen went, to say nothing of myself, where Bigman came from, how he got hold of the ship. They\u0027ll have to know. That will give him time to talk.\"\n \"And to explain how he picked out Hansen\u0027s asteroid out of all the rocks in creation? That would take some tall talking.\"\n \"That won\u0027t take any talking at all. The hermit\u0027s ship was on Ceres, which it is. I\u0027ve arranged to leave it out there unguarded, so he can take it. He\u0027ll find the ship\u0027s home asteroid\u0027s space-time co-ordinates in the logbook. It would just be an asteroid to him, not too far from Ceres, as good as any other, and he would make a beeline for it in order to wait for the furor on Ceres to die down.\"\n \"It\u0027s a risk,\" grumbled Conway.\n \"Bigman knows it. And I tell you right now, we\u0027ve got to take risks. Earth is underestimating the pirate menace so badly that-\"\n He interrupted himself as the signal light of the Com-mum-tube flashed on and off in rapid dots of light.\n Conway, with an impatient motion of his hand, cut in the signal analyzer, then sat up straight.\n He said, \"It\u0027s on the Council wave length and, by Ceres, it\u0027s one of the Council scramblings.\"\n The small visiplate above the Communi-tube was showing a characteristic rapidly shifting pattern of light and dark.\n Conway inserted a sliver of metal, which he took from a group of such in his wallet, into a narrow slot in the Communi-tube. The sliver was a crystallite unscrambler, the active portion of the gadget consisting of a particular pattern of tiny crystals of tungsten embedded in an aluminum matrix. It filtered the sub-etheric signal in a specific way. Slowly Conway adjusted the unscrambler, pushing it in deeper and extracting it again until it matched exactly a scrambler, similar in nature but opposite in function, at the other end of the signal.\n The moment of complete adjustment was heralded by the sudden sharp focusing of the visiplate.\n Lucky half-rose to his feet. \"Bigman!\" he said. \"Where in space are you?\"\n Bigman\u0027s little face was grinning puckishly out at them. \"I\u0027m in space all right. A hundred thousand miles off Ceres. I\u0027m in the hermit\u0027s ship.\"\n Conway whispered furiously, \"Is this another of your tricks? I thought you said he was on Ceres?\"\n \"I thought he was,\" Lucky said. Then, \"What happened, Bigman?\"\n \"You said we had to act quickly, so I fixed things up myself. One of the wise guys in the Control Tower was giving me the business. So I slammed him around a little and took off.\" He laughed. \"Check the guardhouse and see if they\u0027re not on the lookout for a guy like me with a complaint of assault and battery against him.\"\n \"That wasn\u0027t the brightest thing you could have done,\" said Lucky gravely. \"You\u0027ll have a hard time convincing the men of the asteroids that you\u0027re the type for assault. I don\u0027t want to hurt your feelings, but you look a little small for the job.\"\n \"I\u0027ll knock down a few,\" Bigman retorted. \"They\u0027ll believe me. But that\u0027s not why I called.\"\n \"Well, why did you?\"\n \"How do I get to this guy\u0027s asteroid?\"\n Lucky frowned. \"Have you looked in the logbook?\"\n \"Great Galaxy! I\u0027ve looked everywhere. I\u0027ve looked under the mattress even. There\u0027s no record anywhere of any kind of co-ordinates.\"\n Lucky\u0027s look of uneasiness grew. \"That\u0027s strange. In fact it\u0027s worse than strange. Look, Bigman,\" he spoke rapidly and incisively, \"match Ceres\u0027 speed. Give me your co-ordinates with respect to Ceres right now and keep them that way, whatever you do, till I call you. You\u0027re too close to Ceres now for any pirates to bother you, but if you drift out further, you may be in a bad way. Do you hear me?\"\n \"Check. Got you. Let me calculate my co-ordinates.\"\n Lucky wrote them down and broke connections. He said, \"Space, when will I learn not to make assumptions.\"\n Henree said, \"Hadn\u0027t you better have Bigman come back? It\u0027s a foolhardy setup at best and as long as you haven\u0027t the co-ordinates, give the whole thing up.\"\n \"Give it up?\" said Lucky. \"Give up the one asteroid we know to be a pirates\u0027 base? Do you know of any other? One single other? We\u0027ve got to find the asteroid. It\u0027s our only clue to the inside of this knot.\"\n Conway said, \"He\u0027s got a point there, Gus. It is a base.\"\n Lucky jiggled a switch on the intercom briskly and waited.\n Hansen\u0027s voice, sleep-filled but startled, said, \"Hello! Hello!\"\n Lucky said briskly, \"This is Lucky Starr, Mr. Hansen. Sorry to disturb you, but I would like to have you come down here to Dr. Conway\u0027s room as fast as you can.\"\n The hermit\u0027s voice answered after a pause, \"Certainly, but I don\u0027t know the way.\"\n \"The guard at your door will take you. I\u0027ll contact him. Can you make it in two minutes?\"\n \"Two and a half anyway,\" he said, good-humoredly. He sounded more awake.\n \"Good enough!\"\n Hansen was as good as his word. Lucky was waiting for him.\n Lucky paused for a moment, holding the door open. He said to the guard, \"Has there been any trouble at the base earlier this evening? An assault, perhaps?\"\n The guard looked surprised. \"Yes, sir. The man who got hurt refused to press charges, though. Claimed it was a fair fight.\"\n Lucky closed the door. He said, \"That follows. Any normal man would hate to get up in a guardhouse and admit a fellow the size of Bigman had given him a banging. I\u0027ll call the authorities later and have them put the charge on paper anyway. For the record..,. Mr. Hansen.\"\n \"Yes, Mr. Starr?\"\n \"I have a question the answer to which I did not want floating around the intercom system. Tell me, what are the co-ordinates of your home asteroid. Standard and temporal both, of course.\"\n Hansen stared and his china-blue eyes grew round. \"Well, you may find this hard to believe, but do you know, I really couldn\u0027t tell you.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-pirates-of-the-asteroids-lucky-starr-2/page-9.html","bookId":1755,"book":{"id":1755,"title":"Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2) \n Twenty-five years before, Lucky Starr\u0027s parents had been destroyed during a pirate raid on the Terrestrial Empire.
