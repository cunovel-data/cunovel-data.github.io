{"id":71692,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Lucky had seen few such luxurious rooms even on Earth. It was thirty feet long, twenty wide, and thirty high. A balcony circled it. Above and below the walls were lined with book films. A wall projector was set on a pedestal, while on another was a gemlike model of the Galaxy. The lighting was entirely indirect.\n As soon as he set foot within the room, he felt the tug of pseudo-grav motors. It wasn\u0027t set at Earth normal. From the feel of it it seemed somewhere between Earth and Mars normal. There was a delightful sensation of lightness and yet enough pull to allow full muscular co-ordination.\n The hermit had removed his space-suit and suspended it over a white plastic trough into which the frost that had collected thickly over it when they stepped out of frozen space and into the warm, moist air of the room might trickle as it melted.\n He was tall and straight, his face was pink and un-lined, but his hair was quite white, as were his bushy eyebrows, and the veins stood out on the back of his hands.\n He said politely, \"May I help you with your suit?\"\n Lucky came to life. \"That\u0027s all right.\" He clambered out quickly. \"This is an unusual place you have here.\"\n \"You like it?\" Hansen smiled. \"It took many years to make it look like this. Nor is this all there is to my little\n home.\" He seemed filled with a quiet pride.\n \"I imagine so,\" said Lucky. \"There must be a power-plant for light and heat as well as to keep the pseudo-grav field alive. You must have an air purifier and re-placer, water supplies, food stores, all that. \"That\u0027s right.\" \"A hermit\u0027s life is not bad.\"\n The hermit was obviously both proud and pleased. \"It doesn\u0027t have to be,\" he said. \"Sit down, Williams, sit down. Would you like a drink?\"\n \"No, thank you.\" Lucky lowered himself into an armchair. Its apparently normal seat and back masked a soft diamagnetic field that gave under his weight only so far, then achieved a balance that molded itself to every curve of his body. \"Unless you can scare up a cup of coffee?\n \"Easily!\" The old man stepped into an alcove. In seconds he was back with a fragrant and steaming cup, plus a second for himself.\n The arm of Lucky\u0027s chair unfolded into a narrow ledge at the proper touch of Hansen\u0027s toe and the hermit set down one cup into an appropriate recess. As he did so he paused to stare at the younger man. Lucky looked up. \"Yes?\" Hansen shook his head. \"Nothing. Nothing. They faced one another. The lights in the more distant parts of the large room faded until only the area immediately surrounding the two men was clear to vision. \"And now if you\u0027ll pardon an old man\u0027s curiosity, said the hermit, \"I\u0027d like to ask you why you\u0027ve come here.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t come. I was brought,\" said Lucky.\n \"You mean you\u0027re not one of-\" Hansen paused.\n \"No, I\u0027m not a pirate. At least, not yet.\"\n Hansen put down his cup and looked troubled. \"I don\u0027t understand. Perhaps I\u0027ve said things I shouldn\u0027t have.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it. I\u0027m going to be one of them soon enough.\"\n Lucky finished his coffee and then, choosing his words carefully, began with his boarding of the Atlas on the Moon and carried it through to the moment.\n Hansen listened in absorption. \"And are you sure this is what you want to do, young man, now that you\u0027ve seen a little of what the life is like?\"\n I\u0027m sure.\n \"Why, for Earth\u0027s sake?\"\n \"Exactly. For the sake of Earth and what it did to me. It\u0027s no place to live. Why did you come out here?\"\n \"It\u0027s a long story, I\u0027m afraid. You needn\u0027t look alarmed. I won\u0027t tell it. I bought this asteroid long ago as a place for small vacations, and I grew to like it. I kept enlarging the room space, brought furniture and book films from Earth little by little. Eventually I found I had all I needed here. So why not stay here permanently? I asked myself. And I did stay here permanently.\"\n \"Sure. Why not? You\u0027re smart. Back there it\u0027s a mess. Too many people. Too many rut jobs. Next to impossible to get out to the planets, and if you do, it means a job of manual labor. No opportunity for a man any more unless he comes to the asteroids. I\u0027m not old enough to settle down like you. But for a young fellow it\u0027s a free life and an exciting one. There\u0027s room to be boss.\"\n \"The ones who are already boss don\u0027t like young fellows with boss notions in their head. Anton, for instance. I\u0027ve seen him and I know.\"\n \"Maybe, but so far he\u0027s kept his word,\" said Lucky. \"He said if I came out winner over this Dingo, I\u0027d have my chance to join the men of the asteroids. It looks as though I\u0027m getting the chance.\"\n \"It looks as though you\u0027re here, that\u0027s all. What if he returns with proof, or what he calls proof, that you\u0027re a government man.\"\n \"tt \u0026#8250;i_?\u0026#8250;\n He won t.\n \"And if he does? Just to get rid of you?\"\n Lucky\u0027s face darkened and again Hansen looked at him curiously, frowning a bit.\n Lucky said, \"He wouldn\u0027t. He can use a good man and he knows it. Besides, why are you preaching to me? You\u0027re out here yourself playing ball with them.\"\n Hansen looked down. \"It\u0027s true. I shouldn\u0027t interfere with you. It\u0027s just that being alone here so long, I\u0027m apt to talk too much when a person does come along, just to hear the sound of voices. Look, it\u0027s about time for dinner. I would be glad to have you eat with me in silence, if you\u0027d rather. Or else we\u0027ll talk about anything you choose.\"\n \"Well, thanks, Mr. Hansen. No hard feelings.\"\n \"Good.\"\n Lucky followed Hansen through a door into a small pantry lined with canned food and concentrates of all sorts. None of the brand names familiar to Lucky were represented. Instead the contents of each can were described in brightly colored etchings that were themselves integral parts of the metal.\n Hansen said, \"I used to keep fresh meat in a special freeze room. You can get the temperature down all the way on an asteroid, you know, but it\u0027s been two years since I could get that kind of supplies.\"\n He chose half a dozen cans off the shelves, plus a container of milk concentrate. At his suggestion Lucky took up a sealed gallon container of water from a lower shelf.\n The hermit set the table quickly. The cans were of the self-heating type that opened up into dishes with enclosed cutlery.\n Hansen said, with some amusement, indicating the cans, \"I\u0027ve got a whole valley on the outside brim-filled with these things. Discarded ones, that is. A twenty years\u0027 accumulation.\"\n The food was good, but strange. It was yeast-base material, the kind only the Terrestrial Empire produced. Nowhere else in the Galaxy was the pressure of population so great, the billions of people so numerous, that yeast culture had been developed. On Venus, where most of the yeast products were grown, almost any variety of food imitation could be produced: steaks, nuts, butter, candy. It was as nourishing as the real thing, too. To Lucky, however, the flavor was not quite Venusian. There was a sharper tang to it.\n \"Pardon me for being nosy,\" he said, \"but all this takes money, doesn\u0027t it?\"\n \"Oh yes, and I have some. I have investments on Earth. Quite good ones. My checks are always honored, or at least they were until not quite two years ago.\"\n \"What happened then?\"\n \"The supply ships stopped coming. Too risky on account of the pirates. It was a bad blow. I had a good backlog of supplies in most things, but I can imagine how it must have been for the others.\"\n \"The others?\"\n \"The other hermits. There are hundreds of us. They\u0027re not all as lucky as I am. Very few can afford to make their worlds quite this comfortable, but they can manage the essentials. It\u0027s usually old people like myself, with wives dead, children grown up, the world strange and different, who go off by themselves. If they have a little nest egg, they can get a little asteroid started. The government doesn\u0027t charge. Any asteroid you want to settle on, if it\u0027s less than five miles in diameter, is yours. Then if they want they can invest in a sub-etheric receiver and keep up with the universe. If not, they can have book films, or can arrange to have news transcripts brought in by the supply ships once a year, or they can just eat, rest, sleep, and wait to die if they\u0027d rather. I wish, sometimes, I\u0027d got to know some of them.\"\n \"Why haven\u0027t you?\"\n \"Sometimes I\u0027ve felt willing, but they\u0027re not easy people to know. After all, they\u0027ve come here to be alone, and for that matter, so have I.\"\n \"Well, what did you do when the supply ships stopped coming?\"\n \"Nothing at first. I thought surely the government would clean up the situation and I had enough supplies for months. In fact, I could have skimped along for a year, maybe. But then the pirate ships came.\"\n \"And you threw in with them?\"\n The hermit shrugged. His eyebrows drew together in a troubled frown and they finished their meal in silence.\n At the end he gathered the can plates and cutlery and placed them in a wall container in the alcove that led to the pantry. Lucky heard a dim grating noise of metal on metal that diminished rapidly.\n Hansen said, \"The pseudo-grav field doesn\u0027t extend to the disposal tube. A puff of air and they sail out to the valley I told you of, even though it\u0027s nearly a mile away.\"\n \"It seems to me,\" said Lucky, \"that if you\u0027d try a little harder ptaff, you\u0027d get rid of the cans altogether.\"\n \"So I would. I think most hermits do that. Maybe they all do. I don\u0027t like the idea, though. It\u0027s a waste of air, and of metal too. We might reclaim those cans someday. Who knows? Besides even though most of the cans would scatter here and there, I\u0027m sure that some would circle this asteroid like little moons and it\u0027s undignified to think of being accompanied on your orbit by your garbage... Care to smoke? No? Mind if I do?\"\n He lit a cigar and with a contented sigh went on. \"The men of the asteroids can\u0027t supply tobacco regularly, so this is becoming a rare treat for me.\"\n Lucky said, \"Do they furnish you the rest of your supplies?\"\n \"That\u0027s right. Water, machine parts and power-pack renewals. It\u0027s an arrangement.\"\n \"And what do you do for them?\"\n The hermit studied his cigar\u0027s lighted end. \"Not much. They use this world. They land their ships on it and I don\u0027t report them. They don\u0027t come in here and what they do elsewhere on the rock isn\u0027t my business. I don\u0027t want to know. It\u0027s safer that way. Men are left here sometimes, like yourself, and are picked up later. I have an idea they stop for minor repairs sometimes. They bring me supplies in return.\"\n \"Do they supply all the hermits?\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t know. Maybe.\"\n \"It would take an awful lot of supplies. Where would they get them from?\"\n \"They capture ships.\"\n \"Not enough to supply hundreds of hermits and themselves. iSnean, it would take an awful lot of ships.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t know.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you interested? It\u0027s a soft life you have here, but maybe the food we just ate came off a ship whose crew are frozen corpses circling some other asteroid like human garbage. Do you ever think of that?\"\n The hermit flushed painfully. \"You\u0027re getting your revenge for my having preached to you earlier. You\u0027re right, but what can I do? I didn\u0027t abandon or betray the government. They abandoned and betrayed me. My estate on Earth pays taxes. Why am I not protected then? I registered this asteroid with the Terrestrial Outer World Bureau in good faith. It\u0027s part of the Terrestrial dominion. I have every right to expect protection against the pirates. If that\u0027s not forthcoming; if my source of supply coolly says that they can bring me nothing more at any price, what am I supposed to do?\n \"You might say I could have returned to Earth, but how could I abandon all this? I have a world of my own here. My book films, the great classics that I love. I even have a copy of Shakespeare; a direct filming of the actual pages of an ancient printed book. I have food, drink, privacy. I could find nowhere as comfortable as this anywhere else in the Universe.\n \"Don\u0027t think it\u0027s been an easy choice, though. I have a sub-etheric transmitter. I could communicate with Earth. I\u0027ve got a little ship that can make the short haul to Ceres. The men of the asteroids know that, but they trust me. They know I have no choice. As I told you when we first met, I\u0027m an accessory after the fact.\n \"I\u0027ve helped them. That makes me legally a pirate. It would be jail, execution, probably, if I return. If not, if they free me provided I turn state\u0027s evidence, the men of the asteroids won\u0027t forget. They would find me no matter where I went, unless I could be guaranteed complete government protection for life.\"\n \"It looks like you\u0027re in a bad way,\" said Lucky.\n \"Am I?\" said the hermit. \"I might be able to get that complete protection with the proper help.\"\n It was Lucky\u0027s turn. \"I wouldn\u0027t know,\" he said.\n \"I think you would.\"\n I don t get you.\n \"Look, I\u0027ll give you a word of warning in return for help.\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing Z can do. What\u0027s your word?\"\n \"Get off the asteroid before Anton and his men come back.\"\n \"Not on your life. I came here to join them, not to go home.\"\n \"If you don\u0027t leave, you\u0027ll stay forever. You\u0027ll stay as a dead man. They won\u0027t let you on any crew. You won\u0027t qualify, mister.\"\n Lucky\u0027s face twisted in anger. \"What in space are you talking about, old-timer?\"\n \"There it is again. When you get angry, I see it plainly. You\u0027re not Bill Williams, son. What\u0027s your relationship to Lawrence Starr of the Council of Science? Are you Starr\u0027s son?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-pirates-of-the-asteroids-lucky-starr-2/page-7.html","bookId":1755,"book":{"id":1755,"title":"Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2) \n Twenty-five years before, Lucky Starr\u0027s parents had been destroyed during a pirate raid on the Terrestrial Empire.
