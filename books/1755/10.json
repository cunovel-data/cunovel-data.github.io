I should think you would know your coordinates as well as a planet dweller would know his home address.\"\\n\\n The hermit looked at his toes and said mildly, \"I suppose so. It is my home address, really. Yet I don\u0027t know it.\"\\n\\n Conway said, \"If this man is deliberately-\"\\n\\n Lucky broke in. \"Now wait. Let\u0027s force patience on ourselves if we have to. Mr. Hansen must have some explanation.\"\\n\\n They waited for the hermit to speak.\\n\\n Co-ordinates of the various bodies in the Galaxy were the lifeblood of space travel. They fulfilled the same function that lines of latitude and longitude did on the two-dimensional surface of a planet. However, since space is three dimensional, and since the bodies in it move about in every possible way, the necessary coordinates are more complicated.\\n\\n Basically there is first a standard zero position. In the case of the Solar System, the Sun was the usual standard. Based on that standard, three numbers are necessary. The first number is the distance of an object or a position in space from the Sun. The second and third numbers are two angular measurements indicating the position of the object with reference to an imaginary line connecting the Sun and the center of the Galaxy. If three sets of such co-ordinates are known for three different times, set well apart, the orbit of a moving body could be calculated and its position, relative to the Sun, known for any given time.\\n\\n Ships could calculate their own co-ordinates with respect to the Sun or, if it were more convenient, with respect to the nearest large body, whatever it was. On the Lunar Lines, for instance, of which vessels traveled from Earth to the Moon and back, Earth was the customary \"zero point.\" The Sun\u0027s own co-ordinates could be calculated with respect to the Galactic Center and the Galactic Prime Meridian, but that was only important in traveling between the stars.\\n\\n Some of all this might have been passing through the hermit\u0027s mind as he sat there with the three Councilmen watching him narrowly. It was hard to tell.\\n\\n Hansen said suddenly, \"Yes, I can explain.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re waiting,\" said Lucky.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never had occasion to use the co-ordinates in fifteen years. I haven\u0027t left my asteroid at all for two years and before that any trips I made, maybe one or two a year, were short ones to Ceres or Vesta for supplies of one sort or another. When I did that, I used local coordinates which I always calculated out for the moment. I never worked out a table because I didn\u0027t have to.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d only be gone a day or two, three at the most, and my own rock wouldn\u0027t drift far in that time. It travels with the stream, a little slower than Ceres or Vesta when it\u0027s further from the Sun and a little faster when it\u0027s nearer. When I\u0027d head back for the position I calculated, my rock might have drifted ten thousand or even a hundred thousand miles off its original spot, but it was always close enough to pick up with the ship\u0027s telescope. After that, I could always adjust my course by eye. I never used the solar standard co-ordinates because I never had to, and there it is.\"\\n\\n \"What you\u0027re saying,\" said Lucky, \"is that you couldn\u0027t get back to your rock now. Or did you calculate its local co-ordinates before you left?\"\\n\\n \"I never thought to,\" said the hermit sadly.\"It\u0027s been so long since I left it that I never gave the matter a second\u0027s attention. Not until the minute you called me in here.\"\\n\\n Dr. Henree said, \"Wait. Wait.\" He had lit up a fresh pipeful of tobacco and was puffing strongly. \"I may be wrong, Mr. Hansen, but when you first took over ownership of your asteroid, you must have filed a claim with the Terrestrial Outer World Bureau. Is that right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Hansen, \"but it was only a formality.\"\\n\\n \"That could be. I\u0027m not arguing that. Still, the coordinates of your asteroid would be on record there.\"\\n\\n Hansen thought a bit, then shook his head. \"I\u0027m afraid not, Dr. Henree. They took only the standard co-ordinate set for January 1 of that year. That was just to identify the asteroid, like a code number, in case of disputed ownership. They weren\u0027t interested in anything more than that and you can\u0027t compute an orbit from only one set of numbers.\"\\n\\n \"But you yourself must have had orbital values. Lucky told us that you first used the asteroid as an annual vacation spot. So you must have been able to find it from year to year.\"\\n\\n \"That was fifteen years ago, Dr. Henree. I had the values, yes. And those values are somewhere in my record books on the rock, but they\u0027re not in my memory.\"\\n\\n Lucky, his brown eyes clouded, said, \"There\u0027s nothing else at the moment, Mr. Hansen. The guard will take you back to the room and we\u0027ll let you know when we need you again. And, Mr. Hansen,\" he added as the hermit rose, \"if you should happen to think of the co-ordinates, let us know.\"\\n\\n \"My word on that, Mr. Starr,\" said Hansen gravely.\\n\\n The three were alone again. Lucky\u0027s hand shot out to the Communi-tube. \"Key me in for transmission,\" he said.\\n\\n The voice of the man at Central Communications came back. \"Was the previous incoming message for you, sir? I couldn\u0027t unscramble it so I thought-\"\\n\\n \"You did well. Transmission, please.\"\\n\\n Lucky adjusted a scrambler and used Bigman\u0027s coordinates to zero in the sub-etheric beam.\\n\\n \"Bigman,\" he said when the other\u0027s face appeared, \"open the logbook again.\"\\n\\n \"Do you have the co-ordinates, Lucky?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet. Have you got the logbook open?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Is there a sheet of scrap paper somewhere in it? Loose, with calculations all over it?\"\\n\\n \"Wait. Yes. Here it is.\"\\n\\n \"Hold it up in front of your transmitter. I want to see it.\"\\n\\n Lucky pulled a sheet of paper before him and copied down the figuring. \"All right, Bigman, take it away. Now listen, stay put. Get me? Stay put, no matter what, till you hear from me. Signing off.\"\\n\\n He turned to the two older men. \"I navigated the ship from the hermit\u0027s rock to Ceres by eye. I adjusted course three or four times, using his ship\u0027s telescope and vernier instruments for observation and measurements. These are my calculations.\"\\n\\n Conway nodded. \"Now, I suppose, you intend calculating backwards to find out the rock\u0027s co-ordinates.\"\\n\\n \"It can be done easily enough, particularly if we make use of the Ceres Observatory.\"\\n\\n Conway rose heavily. \"I can\u0027t help but think you make too much of all this, but I\u0027ll follow your instinct for a while. Let\u0027s go to the Observatory.\"\\n\\n Corridors and elevators took them close to Ceres\u0027 surface, one half mile above the Council of Science offices on the asteroid. It was chilly there, since the Observatory made every attempt to keep the temperature as constant as possible and as near surface temperature as the human body could endure.\\n\\n Slowly and carefully a young technician was unraveling Lucky\u0027s calculations, feeding them into the computer and controlling the operations.\\n\\n Dr. Henree, in a not too comfortable chair, huddled his thin body together and seemed to be trying to extract warmth from his pipe, for his large-knuckled hands hovered closely about its bowl.\\n\\n He said, \"I hope this comes to something.\"\\n\\n Lucky said, \"It had better.\" He sat back, his eyes fixed thoughtfully on the opposite wall. \"Look, Uncle Hector, you referred to my \u0027instinct\u0027 a while back. It isn\u0027t instinct; not any more. This run of piracy is entirely different from that of a quarter century ago.\"\\n\\n \"Their ships are harder to catch or stop, if that\u0027s what you mean,\" said Conway.\\n\\n \"Yes, but doesn\u0027t that make it all the stranger that their raids are confined to the asteroid belt? It\u0027s only here in the asteroids that trade has been disrupted.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re being cautious. Twenty-five years ago, when their ships ranged all the way to Venus, we were forced to mount an offensive and crush them. Now they stick to the asteroids and the government hesitates to take expensive measures.\"\\n\\n \"So far, so good,\" said Lucky, \"but how do they support themselves? It\u0027s always been the assumption that pirates didn\u0027t raid for pure joy of it alone, but to pick up ships, food, water, and supplies. You would think that now more than ever that was a necessity. Captain Anton boasted to me of hundreds of ships and thousands of worlds. That may have been a lie to impress me, but he certainly took time for the push-gun duel, drifting openly in space for hours as though he had no fear whatever of government interference. And Hansen said, moreover, that the pirates had appropriated the various hermit worlds as stopping-off places. There are hundreds of hermit worlds. If the pirates dealt with all of them, or even a good part of them, that also means a large organization.\\n\\n \"Now where do they get the food to support a large organization and at the same time mount fewer raids now than pirates did twenty-five years ago? The pirate crewman, Martin Maniu, spoke to me of wives and families. He was a vat-man, he said. Presumably he cultured yeast. Hansen had yeast foods on his asteroid and they weren\u0027t Venus yeast. I know the taste of Venus yeast.\\n\\n \"Put it all together. They grow their own food in small yeast farms distributed among asteroid caverns. They can get carbon dioxide directly from limestone rocks, and water and extra oxygen from the Jovian satellites. Machinery and power units may be imported from Sirius or obtained by an occasional raid. Raids will also supply them with more recruits, both men and women.\\n\\n \"What it amounts to is that Sirius is building an independent government against us. It\u0027s making use of discontented people to build a widespread society that will be difficult or impossible to crush if we wait too long. The leaders, the Captain Antons, are after power in the first place and they\u0027re perfectly willing to give half the Terrestrial Empire to Sirius if they themselves can keep the other half.\"\\n\\n Conway shook his head. \"That\u0027s an awfully big structure for the small foundation of fact you have. I doubt if we could convince the government. The Council of Science can act by itself only so far, you know. We don\u0027t have a fleet of our own, unfortunately.\"\\n\\n \"I know. That\u0027s exactly why we need more information. If, while it is still early in the game, we can find their major bases, capture their leaders, expose their Sirian connections-\"\\n\\n \"Well?\"\\n\\n \"Why, it\u0027s my opinion the movement would be done with. I\u0027m convinced that the average \u0027man of the asteroids,\u0027 to use their own phrase, has no idea he\u0027s being made a Sirian puppet. He probably has a grievance against Earth. He may think he\u0027s had a raw deal, resent the fact that he couldn\u0027t find a job or advancement, that he wasn\u0027t getting along as well as he should have. He may have been attracted to what he thought would be a colorfyl life. All that, maybe. Still, that\u0027s a long way from saying he\u0027d be willing to side with Earth\u0027s worst enemy. When he finds out that his leaders have been tricking him into doing just that, the pirate menace will fall apart.\"\\n\\n Lucky halted his intense whispering as the technician approached, holding a flexible transparent tape with the computer\u0027s code prickings upon it.\\n\\n \"Say,\" he said, \"are you sure these figures you gave me were right?\"\\n\\n Lucky said, \"I\u0027m sure. Why?\"\\n\\n The technician shook his head. \"There\u0027s something wrong. The final co-ordinates put your rock inside one of the forbidden zones. That\u0027s allowing for proper motion, too. I mean it can\u0027t be.\"\\n\\n Lucky\u0027s eyebrows lifted sharply. The man was certainly right about the forbidden zones. No asteroids could possibly be found within them. Those zones represented portions of the asteroid belt in which asteroids, if they had existed, would have had times of revolution about the Sun that were an even fraction of Jupiter\u0027s twelve-year period of revolution. That would have meant that the asteroid and Jupiter would have continually approached, every few years, in the same portion of space. Jupiter\u0027s repeated pull would slowly move the asteroid out of that zone. In the two billion years since the planets had been formed Jupiter had cleared every asteroid out of the forbidden zones and that was that.\\n\\n \"Are you sure,\" Lucky said, \"that your calculations are right?\"\\n\\n The technician shrugged as though to say, \"I know my business.\u0027 * But aloud he only said, \"We can check it by telescope. The thousand-incher is busy, but that\u0027s no good for close work anyway. We\u0027ll get one of the smaller ones. Will you follow me, please?\"\\n\\n The Observatory proper was almost like a shrine, with the various telescopes the altars. Men were absorbed in their work and did not pause to look up when the technician and the three Councilmen entered.\\n\\n The technician led the way to one of the wings into which the huge, cavernous room was divided.\\n\\n \"Charlie,\" he said to a prematurely balding young man, \"can you swing Bertha into action?\"\\n\\n \"What for?\" Charlie looked up from a series of photographic prints, star-speckled, over which he had been bending.\\n\\n \"I want to check the spot represented by these coordinates.\" He held out the computer film.\\n\\n Charlie glanced at it and frowned. \"What for? That\u0027s forbidden-zone territory.\"\\n\\n \"Would you focus the point anyway?\" asked the technician. \"It\u0027s Council of Science business.\"\\n\\n \"Oh? Yes, sir.\" He was suddenly far more pleasant. \"It won\u0027t take long.\"\\n\\n He closed a switch and a flexible diaphragm sucked inward high above, closing about the shaft of \"Bertha,\" a hundred-twenty-inch telescope used for close work. The diaphragm made an air-tight seal, and above it Lucky could make out the smooth whir of the surface-lock opening. Bertha\u0027s large eye lifted upward, the diaphragm clinging, and was exposed to the heavens.\\n\\n \"Mostly,\" explained Charlie, \"we use Bertha for photographic work. Ceres\u0027 rotation is too rapid for convenient optical observations. The point you\u0027re interested in is over the horizon, which is lucky.\"\\n\\n He took his seat near the eyepiece, riding the telescope\u0027s shaft as though it were the stiff trunk of a giant elephant. The telescope angled and the young astronomer lifted high. Carefully he adjusted the focus.\\n\\n He lifted out of his perch then and stepped down the rungs of a wall ladder. At the touch of his finger a partition directly below the telescope moved aside to show a black-lined pit. Into it a series of mirrors and lenses could focus and magnify the telescopic image.\\n\\n There was only blackness.\\n\\n Charlie said, \"That\u0027s it.\" He used a meter stick as a point. \"That little speck is Metis, which is a pretty big rock. It\u0027s twenty-five miles across, but it\u0027s millions of miles away. Here you have a few specks within a million miles of the point you\u0027re interested in, but they\u0027re to one side, outside the forbidden zone. We\u0027ve got the stars blanked out by phase polarization or they\u0027d confuse everything.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Lucky. He sounded stunned.\\n\\n \"Any time. Glad to help whenever I can.\"\\n\\n They were in the elevator, headed downward, before Lucky spoke again. He said distantly, \"It can\u0027t be.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" said Henree. \"Your figures were wrong.\"\\n\\n \"How could they be? I got to Ceres.\"\\n\\n \"You may have intended one figure and put d wn another by mistake, then made a correction by eye and forgot to correct the paper.\"\\n\\n Lucky shook his head. \"I couldn\u0027t have done that. 1\\n\\n just don\u0027t-Wait. Great Galaxy!\" He stared at them\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter, Lucky?\"\\n\\n \"It works out! Space, it fits in! Look, I was wrong. It\u0027s not early in the game at all; it\u0027s darned late in the game. It may be too late. I\u0027ve underestimated them again.\"\\n\\n The elevator had reached the proper level. The door opened and Lucky was out with a rapid stride.\\n\\n Conway ran after, seized his elbow, swung him about. \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going out there. Don\u0027t even think of stopping me. And if I don\u0027t come back, for Earth\u0027s sake, force the government to begin major preparations. Otherwise the pirates may be in control of the entire System within a year. Perhaps sooner.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" demanded Conway violently. \"Because you couldn\u0027t find an asteroid?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly,\" said Lucky. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-pirates-of-the-asteroids-lucky-starr-2/page-10.html","bookId":1755,"book":{"id":1755,"title":"Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2)","description":"Storyline: Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2) \\n Twenty-five years before, Lucky Starr\u0027s parents had been destroyed during a pirate raid on the Terrestrial Empire.
