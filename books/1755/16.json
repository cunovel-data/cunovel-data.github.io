{"id":71701,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"For an hour the maneuvers of both ships were indecisive. Lucky had the faster ship and the better, but Captain Anton had a crew. Each of Anton\u0027s men could specialize. One could focus and one could release, while a third could control the reactor banks and Anton himseh0 could direct operations.\\n\\n Lucky, trying to do everything at once and by himseh0, had to rely heavily on words.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t get to Ganymede, Anton, and your friends won\u0027t dare tip their hand by coming out now before they know what\u0027s up... You\u0027re all through, Anton; we know all your plans... There\u0027s no use trying to get a message through to Ganymede, Anton; we\u0027re blanketing the sub-ether from you to Jupiter. Nothing can get through... Government ships are coming, Anton. Count your minutes. You don\u0027t have many, unless you surrender... Give up, Anton. Give up.\"\\n\\n And all this while the Shooting Starr dodged through as concentrated a fire as Lucky had ever seen. Nor were all the blasts successfully dodged. The Shooter\u0027s energy stores began to show the strain. Lucky would have liked to believe that Anton\u0027s ship was suffering equally, but he himseh0 was aiming few blasts at Anton and landing virtually none.\\n\\n He dared not take his eyes off the screen. Terrestrial ships, speeding to the scene, would not be there for hours. In those hours, if Anton beat down his energy banks, broke away, and made good head toward Ganymede, while a limping Shooting Starr could only pursue, without catching... Or if a pirate fleet suddenly sparkled on-screen...\\n\\n Lucky dared not follow those lines of thought further. Perhaps he had been wrong in not entrusting the interception to government ships in the first place. No, he told himself, only the Shooting Starr could have caught Anton still fifty million miles from Ganymede; only the Shooter\u0027s speed; more important still, only the Shooter\u0027s Er-gometers. At this distance from Ganymede it was safe to call in units of the fleet for the kill. Closer to Ganymede and fleet action would have been unsafe.\\n\\n Lucky\u0027s receiver, open all this time, was suddenly activated. Anton\u0027s face filled it, smiling and carefree.\\n\\n \"You got away from Dingo again, I see.\"\\n\\n Lucky said, \"Again? You\u0027re admitting he was working under orders in the push duel!\"\\n\\n An energy feeler toward Lucky\u0027s ship suddenly hardened into a beam of disruptive force. Lucky moved aside with an acceleration that wrenched him.\\n\\n Anton laughed. \"Don\u0027t watch me too closely. We almost caught you then with a lulu. Certainly Dingo was working under orders. We knew what we were doing. Dingo didn\u0027t know who you really were, but I did. Nearly from the first.\"\\n\\n \"Too bad the knowledge didn\u0027t help you,\" said Lucky.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Dingo that it hasn\u0027t helped. It may amuse you to know that he has been, shall we say, executed. It\u0027s bad to make mistakes. But this kind of talk is out of place here. I\u0027m only plating you to say that this has been fun, but I\u0027ll be going now.\"\\n\\n \"You have nowhere to go,\" said Lucky.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try Ganymede.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be stopped.\"\\n\\n \"By government ships? I don\u0027t see them yet. And there\u0027s not one that can catch me in time.\"\\n\\n \"I can catch you.\"\\n\\n \"You have caught me. But what can you do with me? From the way you\u0027re fighting, you must be the only man on board. If I had known that from the beginning, I wouldn\u0027t have bothered with you as long as this. You can\u0027t fight a whole crew.\"\\n\\n Lucky said in a low, intense voice, \"I can ram you. I can smash you completely.\"\\n\\n \"And yourself. Remember that.\"\\n\\n \"That wouldn\u0027t matter.\"\\n\\n \"Please. You sound like a space-scout. You\u0027ll be reciting the junior scout-patrol oath next.\"\\n\\n Lucky raised his voice. \"You men aboard the ship, listen! If your captain tries to break away in the direction of Ganymede, I will ram the ship. It is certain death for all of you, unless you surrender. I promise you all a fair trial. I promise all of you the utmost consideration possible if you co-operate with us. Don\u0027t let Anton throw your lives away for the sake of his Sirian friends.\"\\n\\n \"Talk on, government boy, talk on,\" said Anton. \"I\u0027m letting them listen. They know what kind of a trial they can expect and they know what kind of consideration, too. An injection of enzymic poison.\" His fingers made the quick movements of someone inserting a needle into another\u0027s skin. \"That\u0027s what they\u0027ll get. They\u0027re not afraid of you. Good-by, government boy.\"\\n\\n The needles on Lucky\u0027s gravimetrics wavered downward as Anton\u0027s ship picked up speed and moved away. Lucky watched his visiplates. Where were the government ships? Blast all space, where were the government ships?\\n\\n He let acceleration take hold. Gravimetric needles moved upward again.\\n\\n The miles between the ships were sliced away. Anton\u0027s ship put on more speed; so did the Shooting Starr. But the accelerative possibilities of the Shooter were higher.\\n\\n The smile on Anton\u0027s face did not alter. \"Fifty miles away,\" he said. Then, \"Forty-five.\" Another pause. \"Forty. Have you said your prayers, government boy?\"\\n\\n Lucky did not answer. For him there was no way out. He would have to ram. Sooner than let Anton get through, sooner than allow war to come to Earth, he would have to stop the pirates by suicide, if there were no other way. The ships were curving toward one another in a long, slow tangent.\\n\\n \"Thirty,\" said Anton lazily. \"You\u0027re not frightening anyone. You\u0027ll look a fool in the end. Veer off and go home, Starr.\"\\n\\n \"Twenty-five,\" retorted Lucky firmly. \"You have fifteen minutes to surrender or die.\" He himself, he reflected, had the same fifteen minutes to win or die.\\n\\n A face appeared behind Anton\u0027s in the visiplate. It held a finger to pale, tight lips. Lucky\u0027s eyes might have flickered. He tried to conceal that by looking away, then coming back.\\n\\n Both ships were at maximum acceleration.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter, Starr?\" asked Anton. \"Scared? Heart beating fast?\" His eyes were dancing and his lips were parted.\\n\\n Lucky had the sudden, sure knowledge that Anton was enjoying this, that he considered it an exciting game, that it was only a device whereby he might demonstrate his power. Lucky knew at that moment that Anton would never surrender, that he would allow himself to be rammed rather than back away. And Lucky knew that there was no escape from death.\\n\\n \"Fifteen miles,\" Lucky said.\\n\\n It was Hansen\u0027s face behind Anton. The hermit\u0027s! And there was something in his hand.\\n\\n \"Ten miles,\" said Lucky. Then, \"Six minutes. I\u0027ll ram you. By space, I\u0027ll ram you.\"\\n\\n It was a blaster! Hansen held a blaster.\\n\\n Lucky\u0027s breath came tightly. If Anton turned...\\n\\n But Anton was not going to miss a second of Lucky\u0027s face if he could help it. He was waiting to see the fright come and grow. To Lucky, that was plain as could be in the pirate\u0027s expression. Anton would not have turned for a much noisier event than the careful lifting of a blaster.\\n\\n Anton caught it in the back. Death came too suddenly for the eager smile to disappear from his face, and though life left it, the look of cruel joy did not. Anton fell forward across the visiplate and for a moment his face remained pressed there, larger than life-size, leering at Lucky out of dead eyes.\\n\\n Lucky heard Hansen\u0027s shout, \"Back, all of you. Do you want to die? We\u0027re giving up. Come and get us, Starr!\"\\n\\n Lucky veered the direction of acceleration by two degrees. Enough to miss.\\n\\n His Ergometers were registering the motors of approaching government ships strongly now. They were coming at last.\\n\\n The screens on Anton\u0027s ship were glowing white as a sign of surrender.\\n\\n It was almost an axiom that the fleet was never entirely pleased when the Council of Science interfered too much in what they considered to be the province of the military. Especially so when the interference was spectacularly successful. Lucky Starr knew that well. He was quite prepared for the admiral\u0027s poorly hidden disapproval.\\n\\n The admiral said, \"Dr. Conway has explained the situation adequately, Starr, and we commend you for your actions. However, you must realize that the fleet has been aware of the Sirian danger for some time now and had a careful program of its own. These independent actions on the part of the Council can be harmful. You might mention that to Dr. Conway. Now I have been requested by the Co-ordinator to co-operate with the Council in the next stages of the fight against the pirates, but,\" he looked stubborn, \"I cannot agree to your suggestion that we delay an attack on Ganymede. I think the fleet is capable of making its own decisions where battle, and victory are concerned.\"\\n\\n The admiral was in his fifties and unused to consulting on equal terms with anyone, let alone a youngster of half his age. His square-cut face with its bristly gray mustache showed it.\\n\\n Lucky was tired. The reaction, now that Anton\u0027s ship had been taken in tow and its crew in custody, had set in. He managed, however, to be very respectful. He said, \"I think that if we mop up the asteroids first, the Sirians on Ganymede will automatically cease being a problem.\"\\n\\n \"Good Galaxy, man, how do you mean \u0027mop up.\u0027 We\u0027ve been trying to do that for twenty-five years without success. Mopping up the asteroids is like chasing feathers. As for the Sirian base, we know where it is, and we have a good notion as to its strength.\" He smiled briefly. \"Oh, it may be hard for the Council to realize this, but the fleet is on its toes as well as they are. Perhaps even more so. For instance, I know that the power at my command is enough to break their strength on Ganymede. We are ready for the battle.\"\\n\\n \"I have no doubt that you are and that you can defeat the Sirians. But the ones on Ganymede are not all the Sirians there are. You may be ready for a battle, but are you ready for a long and costly war?\"\\n\\n The admiral reddened. \"I have been asked to cooperate, but I cannot do so at the risk of Earth\u0027s safety. I can under no conditions lend my voice to a plan which involves dispersing our fleet among the asteroids, while a Sirian expedition is in being in the Solar System.\"\\n\\n \"May I have an hour?\" interrupted Lucky. \"One hour to speak with Hansen, the Cerean captive I had brought aboard this ship just before you boarded, sir?\"\\n\\n \"How will that help?\"\\n\\n \"May I have an hour to show you?\"\\n\\n The admiral\u0027s lips pressed together. \"An hour may be valuable. It may be priceless... Well, begin, but quickly. Let\u0027s see how it goes.\"\\n\\n \"Hansen!\" called Lucky without taking his calm eyes from the admiral.\\n\\n The hermit entered from the bunk room. He looked tired, but managed a smile for Lucky. His stay on the pirate ship had apparently left his spirits unmarked.\\n\\n He said, \"I\u0027ve been admiring your ship, Mr. Starr. It\u0027s quite a piece of metal.\"\\n\\n \"Look here,\" said the admiral, \"none of that. Get on with it, Starr! Never mind your ship.\"\\n\\n Lucky said, \"This is the situation, Mr. Hansen. We\u0027ve stopped Anton, with your invaluable help, for which I thank you. That means we\u0027ve delayed the start of hostilities with Sirius. However, we need more than delay. We must remove the danger completely, and as the admiral will tell you, our time is very short.\"\\n\\n \"How can I help?\" asked Hansen.\\n\\n \"By answering my questions.\"\\n\\n \"Gladly, but I\u0027ve told you all I know. I\u0027m sorry that it turned out to be worth so little.\"\\n\\n \"Yet the pirates believed you to be a dangerous man. They risked a great deal to get you out of our hands.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t explain that.\"\\n\\n \"Is it possible that you have a piece of knowledge without being aware of it? Something that could be deadly for them?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see how.\"\\n\\n \"Well, they trusted you. By the information you yourself gave me, you were rich; a man with good investments on Earth. Certainly you were much better off than the average hermit. Yet the pirates treated you well. Or at least they didn\u0027t mistreat you. They didn\u0027t rifle your belongings. In fact, they left your very luxurious home completely in peace.\"\\n\\n \"Remember, Mr. Starr, I helped them in return.\"\\n\\n \"Not very much. You said that you allowed them to land on your rock, to leave people there sometimes and that\u0027s about all. If they had simply shot you down, they could have had that and your quarters as well. In addition, they would not have had to worry about your becoming an informer. You eventually did become one, you know.\"\\n\\n Hansen\u0027s eyes shifted. \"That\u0027s the way it was, though. I told you the truth.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, what you told me was true. It wasn\u0027t the whole truth, however. I say that there must have been a good reason for the pirates to trust you so completely. They must have known that it meant your life to go to the government.\"\\n\\n \"I told you that,\" said Hansen mildly.\\n\\n \"You said that you had incriminated yourself by helping the pirates, but they trusted you when they first arrived, before you had begun helping them. Otherwise they would have blasted you to begin with. Now, let me guess. I\u0027d say that once, before you became a hermit, you were a pirate yourself, Hansen, and that Anton and men like him knew about it. What do you say?\"\\n\\n Hansen\u0027s face went white.\\n\\n Lucky said, \"What do you say, Hansen?\"\\n\\n Hansen\u0027s voice was very soft. \"You are right, Mr. Starr. I was once a member of the crew of a pirate ship. That was a long time ago. I have tried to live it down. I retired to the asteroids and did my best to be dead as far as Earth was concerned. When a new group of pirates arose in the Solar System and entangled me, I had no choice but to play along with them.\\n\\n \"When you landed, I found my first chance to leave; my first chance to take the risk of facing the law. Twenty-five years had passed, after all. And I would have in my favor the fact that I had risked my life to save the life of a Councilman. That was why I was so anxious to fight the pirate raiders on Ceres. I wanted to make another point in my favor. Finally, I killed Anton, saving your life a second time, and giving Earth a breathing space, you tell me, in which a war may be prevented. I was a pirate, Mr. Starr, but that\u0027s gone, and I think I\u0027ve evened the score.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Lucky, \"as far as it goes. Now do you have any information for us that you didn\u0027t mention before?\"\\n\\n Hansen shook his head.\\n\\n Lucky said, \"You didn\u0027t tell us you were a pirate.\"\\n\\n \"That was irrelevant, really. And you found out for yourself. I didn\u0027t try to deny it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, then let\u0027s see if we can find anything else which you won\u0027t deny. You see, you still haven\u0027t told the whole truth.\"\\n\\n Hansen looked surprised. \"What remains?\"\\n\\n \"The fact that you\u0027ve never stopped being a pirate.\"\\n\\n The fact that you are a person that was only mentioned once in my hearing, and that by one of Anton\u0027s crewmen; shortly after my push-gun duel with Dingo. The fact I that you are the so-called Boss. You, Mr. Hansen, are the mastermind of the asteroid pirates.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-pirates-of-the-asteroids-lucky-starr-2/page-16.html","bookId":1755,"book":{"id":1755,"title":"Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2)","description":"Storyline: Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (Lucky Starr #2) \\n Twenty-five years before, Lucky Starr\u0027s parents had been destroyed during a pirate raid on the Terrestrial Empire.
