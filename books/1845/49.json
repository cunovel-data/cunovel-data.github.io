You look tired.\"\n \"So do you. Brenna, don\u0027t ever put me through this torment again. Promise me you won\u0027t leave me, no matter what happens.\"\n \"I promise you. Come and meet my sister. What in heaven\u0027s name is she doing? She\u0027s entirely too close to the end of the path. None of the MacAlisters would…\"\n \"Quinlan would.\"\n \"What are you saying?\"\n \"If she steps off the path, he\u0027s got her. That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying.\"\n \"Make him stop staring at her.\"\n \"Your sister doesn\u0027t seem to mind. She\u0027s staring back. She keeps moving closer to him too.\"\n \"Faith, come over here,\" Brenna shouted.\n Her sister ignored her. \"Connor, make Quinlan and Crispin come here.\"\n \"I can ask, but neither one of them will come. As far as they\u0027re concerned, their duty has already been determined. They\u0027re protecting us, sweetheart. You should be proud of their restraint.\"\n \"Why should I be proud of them?\"\n \"They want to kill the English, of course.\"\n Dear heavens, she\u0027d forgotten about Gillian. \"You must come and meet my brother.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"If he comes to you, will you meet him then?\"\n He shrugged before he gave her his conditions. \"If he\u0027s armed, I\u0027ll have to take him aside and discuss the insult with him.\"\n She knew what that meant. \"He won\u0027t be armed,\" she rushed out. \"I\u0027ll go get him.\"\n \"No.\"\n The force behind the denial told her she wasn\u0027t going to get him to change his mind. Father Sinclair came to her aid. A moment later, Gillian joined them at the center of the path. Like Connor, he was also unarmed.\n Her husband didn\u0027t particularly want her to embrace her brother, but he didn\u0027t make an issue of it.\n While she thanked Gillian for coming to get Faith, Father Sinclair went to fetch their sister. He got to her in the nick of time, he realized, when Quinlan winked at her. The priest grabbed her before she stepped off the path.\n \"You may say good-bye to the MacAlisters in a few minutes, Faith. Your sister would appreciate your help in gaining Gillian\u0027s cooperation.\"\n \"Is Brenna\u0027s husband cooperating?\"\n \"No, no, of course not, but both Brenna and I know he will never cooperate with an Englishman. He hasn\u0027t killed him, though, and we must all appreciate the control he is showing for his wife\u0027s benefit.\"\n Faith shook her head but quickened her step until she was running.\n \"I\u0027m sorry I took so long, Gillian.\"\n Her brother\u0027s response was to push her behind him. She took immediate exception and pushed him back. Then she ran to her sister and sat down on the wall next to her.\n The two men continued to face each other as adversaries.\n Brenna became impatient in no time at all. \"Gillian, aren\u0027t you happy to see me?\"\n He finally stopped staring at Connor long enough to look at her. \"Yes, of course I am. Are you coming home with me?\"\n \"No. I\u0027m going home with my husband. We are married, Gillian, and I assure you, I\u0027m very happy. Tell Father I forgive him for sending me to MacNare.\"\n \"He didn\u0027t know what the bastard was capable of, Brenna. He also doesn\u0027t know you\u0027re married.\"\n Faith explained before Brenna could ask any questions. \"He thinks you\u0027re living in sin,\" she whispered so her sister\u0027s husband wouldn\u0027t overhear.\n Father Sinclair stepped forward. \"It was a proper ceremony, Gillian, with the church\u0027s blessing.\"\n \"Did you marry them?\" Gillian asked.\n \"I did.\"\n His blue eyes bore into the priest. It was obvious he was trying to decide if he should believe him or not.\n \"Gillian, please tell Mother I\u0027m sorry she and Father weren\u0027t able to attend my wedding.\"\n Her brother once again turned to her. \"Were you married in a church?\"\n \"We were married in one of God\u0027s most beautiful chapels. No expense was spared. There were flowers everywhere, and in every color imaginable. I entered the chapel under a canopy of green branches that were so fresh and new, dew still clung to them and sparkled like jewels against the flickering lights above.\n The scent of heather surrounded us while we pledged ourselves to one another. Both Connor and I were finely adorned in the most magnificent of robes, and when the ceremony was properly blessed, we attended our wedding feast.\"\n Her eyes were misty with her recollection, and the joy her brother saw as she gave the details only a woman would remember convinced him that she had indeed been properly wed. It was also apparent that she was happy.\n \"The wedding was magical, wasn\u0027t it, Father?\" The priest was overcome by her recitation. He dabbed at the corners of his eyes with the edge of his sleeve, nodded several times, and said, \"Aye, lass, it was magical, and meant to be. Do you realize, Baron, that if it weren\u0027t for Laird MacAlister, your sister probably wouldn\u0027t be alive today.\"\n \"Yes, I realize it.\"\n It was all he was willing to give. Brenna found his acknowledgment satisfying. Connor couldn\u0027t have cared less. His wife\u0027s memory of their wedding had overwhelmed him, and all he wanted to do was get her alone and tell her how proud he was of her.\n \"Brenna, it\u0027s time to go home.\"\n \"Yes, Connor.\"\n She stood up, went to her brother, and kissed him on his cheek. \"I love you, Gillian.\"\n \"I love you too, Brenna. Make him take care of you.\"\n \"He does take good care of me. He loves me, Gillian, and I love him.\"\n \"I can see you do.\"\n The two men stared at each other for a long silent moment. Brenna stood between them, waiting for them to acknowledge each other.\n Gillian finally conceded. He bowed his head to her husband. Connor inclined his head then to him.\n It was as good as it was going to get, Brenna knew, and even though they were both arrogant and stubborn, she still loved them.\n Connor put his arm around his wife and turned to leave.\n \"Just one minute, Laird,\" Faith called out. She went around her brother\u0027s back so he couldn\u0027t detain her and chased after Brenna and Connor.\n \"Laird, do you know how many brothers and sisters your wife has?\"\n Brenna nudged him so he would answer. \"My wife is the seventh of eight in the family. You\u0027re the youngest, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes. Do you know their names?\"\n \"Faith, it isn\u0027t necessary to…\"\n \"Yes, it is necessary. We\u0027re important to you, and therefore we should be important to your husband, shouldn\u0027t we?\"\n \"Come here, Faith.\"\n She didn\u0027t even think about refusing him. She hurried forward and looked up into his eyes. \"Yes?\"\n \"Yes, Laird,\" Brenna corrected.\n \"He\u0027s my brother now. Must I still call him Laird?\"\n \"You know perfectly well you must until he gives you permission to drop the title, which I might add, he hasn\u0027t done yet. We were raised in the same household.\"\n Faith laughed. \"Very well. My question wasn\u0027t answered yet, Laird. Would you like me to tell you the names of our brothers and sisters?\"\n \"That isn\u0027t necessary. There\u0027s Gillian, William, Arthur, Matilda, whom you call Mattie, Joan, Rachel, my wife, and you.\"\n \"You knew… all the while, you knew who they were?\" Brenna asked.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Then why didn\u0027t you let me talk about them?\"\n \"Because you were mourning your family. Talking about them wouldn\u0027t have made you feel any better. I also wanted your loyalty. I believe I already explained this to you.\"\n She leaned against him. \"You may explain it again when we get home. Faith, it\u0027s time to say good-bye. I\u0027ll miss you.\"\n Her sister hugged her. \"I shall miss you more. Laird, I forgot to thank you. Gillian told me you sent men to my home to protect me from MacNare.\"\n \"You sent soldiers to my parents? They went into England?\"\n Brenna was staggered.\n \"Yes, he did,\" Faith assured her. \"Mother liked the soldiers. Father wasn\u0027t there, but he was pleased when he heard the lengths your husband had gone to to protect me. I was wondering…\"\n \"Yes?\" Connor asked. Neither his wife nor her sister realized they were walking toward the end of the sanctuary. Quinlan certainly noticed, if his grin was a true indicator. Knowing his friend as well as he did, Connor was certain he had already counted the number of steps Faith would have to take to leave the sanctuary of the church and become fair game.\n \"Are the others here? I wanted to tell the man in charge thank you too, but I don\u0027t know his name.\"\n \"His name is Quinlan. He will soon be laird over his uncle\u0027s clan, now that his duty to me has ended, and yes, he is here, Faith. He\u0027s watching you even now.\"\n She immediately looked up at Quinlan and took another step toward him.\n \"My brother told me what you did. My father will want to thank you for coming to his home to protect me. I thank you too, Quinlan, with all my heart.\"\n Her Gaelic was music to his ears, and unlike her sister\u0027s, her command of his language was remarkable.\n He didn\u0027t speak to her, but he bowed his head in acknowledgment. Lord above, when she smiled, she had dimples.\n \"Apparently, my mother has taken quite a fancy to you. I hear that she wonders if you will ever come back.\"\n Connor heard what she said and looked up at his friend. \"She makes it almost too easy for you, doesn\u0027t she?\"\n Quinlan laughed. \"Aye, she does.\"\n Neither Brenna nor Faith understood what Connor had meant by his question. What would be easy?\n Faith was just about to leave when Quinlan spoke to her. \"Tell your mother I will be coming back. She has something I want.\"\n She wanted to ask him to explain, but felt it would be impolite of her to question him any further. \"Then perhaps I will see you again. I don\u0027t plan to marry for at least two years, no matter how much my father disagrees. I\u0027m old enough, of course, but I\u0027ve realized I\u0027m hopelessly spoiled, and since I don\u0027t have any intention of changing, I will have to find a baron who will promise to pamper me, and that\u0027s going to take time. If I have already wed before you arrive, then please remember how thankful I am to you.\n Good-bye, Quinlan. I hope God watches over you.\"\n She made a perfect curtsy to show her respect, kissed Brenna and her husband farewell, much to Connor\u0027s astonishment, then turned and went running back to her scowling brother.\n \"I\u0027m going to miss Faith most of all,\" Brenna admitted.\n \"You\u0027ll probably see her again,\" he said.\n \"I doubt that,\" she replied. \"I\u0027m sorry Quinlan will be leaving us. Will Crispin be given command each time you\u0027re called away?\"\n \"No, he\u0027ll go to Hugh\u0027s holding. They have asked me to assign someone to become their leader. They need Crispin, and he will be pleased as well.\"\n He lifted his wife onto the black, swung up behind her, and then leaned down close to her ear and told her again how much he loved her.\n \"We\u0027re starting over again, aren\u0027t we?\"\n \"If it makes you happy to think we are, then I won\u0027t argue with you. It will be easier, however, because I will remember always to be thoughtful.\"\n \"You already are thoughtful, and is it any wonder at all why I love you? I was wondering…\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"I would like to ride bareback again, and if you rode with me, could I ride one of the other horses?\"\n \"If you agree to stay inside the fortress when you ride bareback, I will grant this request. Do you see how I can be accommodating, wife?\"\n \"Yes, I do,\" she agreed. \"And since you\u0027re in such a wonderful mood…\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"About the chapel…\"\n Epilogue\n Sunset was a magical time. The children would be outside, running barefoot up and down the paths and shrieking with laughter while their mother kept a watchful eye on their youngest, a fiery-headed bairn with a wobble in her gait and a devilish gleam in her blue eyes, who found great sport in plucking the flowers out of the ground as soon as her mama planted them.\n He would go up to his bedroom to remove his sword before joining them in their games, but he always lingered in front of the window to look out beyond the walls.\n The first sprig of heather blossomed almost as soon as the ruins were torn down, and now the field was alive with rich, glorious hues, a fitting tribute, his wife believed, to the man who had gone before.\n The scent of honey mingled with the sound of laughter, and, oh, what a joy it was to be home. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-49.html","bookId":1845,"book":{"id":1845,"title":"The Wedding (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #2)","description":"Storyline: \n It\u0027s a classic plot: a marriage of convenience that lays the groundwork for true love. \n 1119.
