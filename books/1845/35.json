{"id":77271,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\"Thank you, madam.\"\n Managing to get to her bedroom without offending the woman, Brenna leaned against the door and let out a loud sigh.\n Netta stood at the hearth, warming herself in front of the fire. \"Did Lady Euphemia go along with your plan to try five different cooks?\"\n Brenna smiled. \"Yes, she did. Be sure to remind Ada she mustn\u0027t let Euphemia see her until the end of the week.\"\n \"She knows, mi\u0027lady, and she\u0027s most appreciative of your efforts. She\u0027s worried though that Lady Euphemia will know she prepared all the meals through the week. Are you sure you wouldn\u0027t rather have someone else…\"\n \"I\u0027m certain,\" Brenna replied. \"Ada\u0027s a fine cook. Our laird\u0027s stepmother likes to be difficult. I\u0027ve decided we aren\u0027t being disloyal to our laird with our trickery,\" she added. \"We\u0027re simply trying to make his relatives happy, that\u0027s all.\"\n \"None of us feel tricking Lady Euphemia is disloyal. Do you have any idea how long she and her son plan to stay?\"\n \"No, but I assure you, that will be the first question I ask my husband.\"\n \"Is there something else bothering you? I noticed you barely touched your food tonight, and when you came inside the room a moment ago, your face was terribly pale.\"\n Brenna wasn\u0027t about to tell her about Raen, believing it was up to her, not a servant, to solve this problem. To condemn the laird\u0027s stepbrother would have severe ramifications, she imagined; God only knew, she would have been sickened if one of her own brothers\u0027 wives cried out against another brother.\n As Connor\u0027s wife, it was her dreaded duty to tell him, no one else.\n \"I wasn\u0027t very hungry tonight,\" she said in answer to Netta\u0027s question.\n The servant left a few minutes later. After bolting the door, Brenna sat down on the bed and worked on her sewing. Ada had given her a bright saffron-colored cloth to put on the table, and Brenna was trying to embroider the colors of Connor\u0027s plaid into a square in the center of the material. Because she wanted it to be perfect, she labored well into the night, making certain each one of the stitches was straight, and if she kept to her schedule, she would be finished in just a few more days.\n She didn\u0027t plan to put it on the table until she had sewn into squares the plaids she\u0027d cut and stuffed with sheep\u0027s wool, which meant she would have to sew at least one hour every morning, but if the weather proved accommodating, she meant to sit outside with the other women and get to know them at the same time.\n She wasn\u0027t going to sit about all day long though, especially when the sun was out, and so she decided to allow one hour each afternoon to go riding. Learning how to ride bareback intrigued her, and as Connor\u0027s wife, shouldn\u0027t she know how?\n Besides, how difficult could it be?\n Chapter 12\n She almost killed herself—several times as a matter of fact—and all in the first afternoon she tried to ride bareback.\n Davis swore to Quinlan that he never would have allowed his mistress to even look at their laird\u0027s stallion if he had known what she intended to do. She hadn\u0027t understood why her husband would leave the horse behind, and Davis was happy to explain that the stallion needed to rest and feed because he\u0027d been ridden so hard. She suggested the beast needed a little pampering as well, and Davis hadn\u0027t disagreed with her.\n When she asked him if she could take the stallion out for a little stroll, he made her give him every assurance she meant only to walk the black up the hill and back so he could get a little exercise and attention. The stallion had obviously taken to her. Why, the way he let her lead him to the stables on the very first day of her arrival proved he had accepted her, and hadn\u0027t her skill handling the horse been apparent to just about everyone?\n Watching the docile way the animal pranced up the hill at her side had assured Davis he had made the right decision. His suspicions surely would have been aroused if Lady Brenna had asked him for a saddle, but she hadn\u0027t asked, now had she?\n \"I\u0027m not saying our mistress out and out lied to me, Quinlan. That ain\u0027t what I\u0027m saying, or even suspecting. I\u0027m thinking she must have changed her mind once she walked over the crest. The notion must have struck her then, and she couldn\u0027t resist giving it a try. Don\u0027t you worry though. I won\u0027t be so easily swayed again, but I\u0027m not even thinking she might try to lie to me. I\u0027m just saying she might get another one of her notions again. That\u0027s all.\"\n Quinlan accepted Davis\u0027s explanation. Like the stablemaster, he wasn\u0027t concerned his mistress would ever take such a chance again, because he thought she\u0027d finally come to her senses after the scare she had flying through the air like an eagle suddenly deprived of its wings.\n And so, the very next day, while he was checking on the progress of the soldiers working on the wall, she took the stallion out for a nice stroll once again. Because she was walking with such a stiff gait, Davis didn\u0027t suffer a moment\u0027s worry.\n But then, he hadn\u0027t realized his mistress was completely daft. At least that was the excuse he whispered to Quinlan, begging his forgiveness all the while because he knew he shouldn\u0027t criticize his laird\u0027s dear wife.\n \"She tricked me, she did,\" Davis told his commander. \"I\u0027m not saying she looked me right in the eye and lied to me. No, that\u0027s not what I\u0027m saying at all. I\u0027m thinking it though, because this time I was real specific with her, firm as I could be, and when I demanded her promise she wouldn\u0027t get up on the beast again, she answered me with a big smile, which told me she agreed with my ruling, because anyone with any sense at all knows a woman doesn\u0027t smile at you after being given an order unless she means to follow it. You don\u0027t have to be worried another minute, Quinlan. I\u0027m on to her now, all right. She won\u0027t be fooling me again.\"\n She did exactly that the following afternoon. Davis conveniently disappeared as soon as word reached him his mistress was once again riding the stallion.\n He needn\u0027t have bothered to hide, as Quinlan finally realized he was going to have to take up the problem himself before his mistress killed herself. Davis simply wasn\u0027t up to it.\n Determined to prevent disaster, the soldier had every intention of forbidding Lady Brenna to ever take such a dangerous risk again; yet as he strode through the break in the pines at the crest of the slope, he heard her laughter and began to have misgivings. A second later, he saw her sitting upright on the stallion\u0027s back. The look of joy on her face made him smile, and he stood there a long while watching her, even though he knew he should put an immediate stop to her dangerous antics.\n Saints be praised, Lady Brenna managed to stay upright for several minutes before she was tossed to the ground.\n Quinlan waited for her to get up. She didn\u0027t move. He started running down the incline, and he swore later to Crispin that his heart had surely stopped when, just he was about to reach her, the stallion came charging back.\n He was certain the beast would trample her. The big black nudged her instead, and quick as a wink, she rolled over, grabbed hold of the horse\u0027s reins, and burst into laughter.\n He took the reins out of her hand, slapped the stallion\u0027s hindquarters to get him to move away from her, and then bent down to offer his hand. \"When you didn\u0027t move, I thought you were dead.\"\n \"It\u0027s a game we play. If I stay perfectly still, Willie comes right over to my side, and I can grab hold of his reins. Otherwise, he makes me chase him.\"\n Quinlan was too distraught to pay attention to a word she said. He kept telling himself not to raise his voice to her—she was his mistress, for the love of God, not his younger sister. \"Have you lost your sense?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"If you insist on killing yourself, do so on Crispin\u0027s watch, not mine.\"\n After giving her his order, he pulled her to her feet, then stood back while she brushed the dust off her plaid. He wanted her full attention so there wouldn\u0027t be any misunderstandings. \"You will not take such a risk again. I want your word you\u0027ll never ride without a saddle, and I assure you, a smile isn\u0027t going to work on me.\"\n \"No, you are far more clever than I am, Quinlan. I would never dare to trick you.\"\n Somewhat placated, he reminded her she still hadn\u0027t given him her promise.\n \"Do you think you could manage to stop shouting at me? You\u0027re making my head pound.\"\n Quinlan was appalled by his conduct. \"I beg your forgiveness, mi\u0027lady. I cannot imagine what came over me.\"\n \"I gave you a scare,\" she reminded him. \"Now, tell me what I\u0027m doing wrong. Why can\u0027t I stay very long on his back?\"\n \"You sit too far back on the black\u0027s back,\" he answered. \"As for your promise…\"\n She cut him off. \"I certainly could have used your advice yesterday. My grip was off as well, but I have already corrected that problem. Poor Willie. For a while there, he kept tossing his head back at me, and I\u0027m sure he thought I was daft.\"\n The horse had more sense than his mistress did, Quinlan thought. He was still too upset to consider how uncharitable he was being. \"It\u0027s amazing he didn\u0027t trample you to death,\" he muttered. \"Willie… did I hear you call the black Willie?\"\n \"Yes, but I made certain first that Connor hadn\u0027t already named him. Davis assured me he hadn\u0027t.\"\n \"No, Connor didn\u0027t name…\" His voice trailed off into silence.\n \"Then I\u0027m certain he won\u0027t mind if I call him Willie.\"\n Quinlan\u0027s eyelid began to twitch. \"Why \u0027Willie\u0027?\" he asked.\n \"It\u0027s short for William,\" she explained. She took the reins away from Quinlan and turned to walk back to the stables. He happened to notice she left one of her shoes behind, picked it up, and handed it to her.\n She thanked him while she held on to his arm so she could keep her balance slipping the shoe back on.\n \"I\u0027m naming Willie after my brother. If I don\u0027t mention it to my husband, I\u0027m sure he won\u0027t be bothered.\n Connor doesn\u0027t like it when I talk about my family.\"\n \"Why would you think he doesn\u0027t like it?\"\n \"He frowns and tries to change the subject. I\u0027m not certain why he feels the way he does. He can\u0027t dislike them, because he doesn\u0027t know them. Perhaps he just doesn\u0027t care. The topic of my family probably bores him,\" she added with a nod.\n \"I doubt that, mi\u0027lady.\"\n She shrugged. \"Perhaps,\" she agreed, but not because she thought he might be right. She was just being polite.\n \"I would appreciate it if you wouldn\u0027t mention my name for his horse. Connor can be peculiar about some things, and even though I\u0027m almost certain he won\u0027t be irritated, there\u0027s a slim chance he might.\"\n \"Mi\u0027lady, are you asking me not to tell him?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I won\u0027t make a point of telling him, but if he asks, I will explain. Are you going to give me your promise you won\u0027t ride bareback again?\"\n \"What would you do if I gave you my promise and then I deliberately broke it? I would never do such a thing, but I am curious about the consequences.\"\n \"I would have you locked in your chamber until your husband returns.\"\n \"You would do such a thing?\"\n \"I certainly wouldn\u0027t want to, but keeping you safe would outweigh your feelings.\"\n \"Could you ever banish anyone?\"\n \"I would never banish you,\" he assured her.\n \"But do you have the authority to banish someone else while Connor is away?\"\n \"Yes, as long as I have valid reasons to give my laird.\"\n \"Do I happen to have the authority? Don\u0027t look so stunned. I wasn\u0027t thinking of banishing you, even if you dared to lock me in my room, which, by the way, I happen to know you would never do. I was wondering if I could send someone else away.\"\n \"If you\u0027re having difficulty with someone, then you should tell me about it, or wait until your husband comes home.\"\n She interpreted his explanation to mean she didn\u0027t have the authority. At least now she knew what she was up against, and she certainly wouldn\u0027t threaten Raen with banishment because he would know she was bluffing. She let out a weary sigh and stared down at the ground while she walked along.\n Her disappointment was softened by the recollection that she was only going to resort to such a drastic measure if Raen ever came near her again. Thankfully, she had a plan to keep him at bay.\n Quinlan couldn\u0027t understand why his mistress looked so disheartened. \"Did you wish to hold such a position of strength, mi\u0027lady?\"\n She didn\u0027t answer him and, in fact, didn\u0027t say another word for a long while.\n \"If you have a problem and you cannot solve it on your own, then tell me what it is and I will be happy to take care of it.\"\n She shook her head. \"The problem is of a personal nature involving a family member.\"\n Quinlan was relieved, and though he felt like smiling, he didn\u0027t, for fear he would injure her feelings and make her think her problem wasn\u0027t important to him.\n \"You\u0027re having difficulty with Euphemia, aren\u0027t you?\" He didn\u0027t give her time to answer him but continued on with a suggestion he was certain would solve her worry. \"It would be appropriate for you to speak to Raen about his mother. I\u0027m certain he\u0027ll talk to her.\"\n She shook her head again, though far more vehemently. \"I should be able to solve this problem, and when Connor returns, I\u0027ll discuss it with him.\"\n \"As you wish, mi\u0027lady.\"\n She changed the subject then. \"You know that ever since I arrived, I\u0027ve been trying to understand how things are done here. There seems to be a set of regulations everyone else understands but me. I constantly fear I\u0027ll offend someone because of my lack of education about Highlanders, and I could certainly benefit from your instruction.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be happy to help in any way that I can.\"\n \"Will you and two others you select join me for the evening meal tonight? We could continue our discussion then, and I could learn about the MacAlisters. I\u0027m one of you now and do want to fit in.\"\n \"I would be honored to join you at the table, and I\u0027m certain the other two I choose will feel the same way.\"\n And I\u0027ll be relieved, she thought to herself.\n \"I don\u0027t want to show any favoritism, however, and so, each night that Connor is away, if you would please select two other guests, then I could also become acquainted with some of my husband\u0027s followers.\"\n \"Certainly,\" he answered.\n \"When will Connor be home?\"\n \"I cannot say for certain.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-35.html","bookId":1845,"book":{"id":1845,"title":"The Wedding (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #2)","description":"Storyline: \n It\u0027s a classic plot: a marriage of convenience that lays the groundwork for true love. \n 1119.
