{"id":77253,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"He wouldn\u0027t be cruel, though, and for that reason, Quinlan didn\u0027t try to intervene. The fat was in the fire now, and she had placed it there when she deliberately provoked her husband by asking him such an atrocious question. She would have to suffer the consequences of her actions, and by moving a little distance away from the two of them, Quinlan hoped she would realize he wouldn\u0027t, and couldn\u0027t, come to her assistance.\\n\\n Connor didn\u0027t have any intention of losing his temper, for he knew that his bride was worn out. The shadows under her eyes indicated her exhaustion. He was fully responsible for her condition, of course, and believed the only thing he could do about it now was force her to bed. Getting her to relax enough to sleep was going to be a little more difficult. She\u0027d have to get rid of the tension inside her first, and perhaps arguing would serve that purpose. A good fight always left him feeling relaxed, and while he admitted he didn\u0027t know anything at all about how gentlewomen like Brenna would react, he didn\u0027t believe there was any harm in letting her rail at him. Once she was rested, she would become reasonable again, or so he hoped, and then she would beg his forgiveness.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re being unreasonable, Brenna.\"\\n\\n \"I believe I\u0027m being very reasonable.\"\\n\\n \"You do? Then explain your reason for asking me such a question. Did your sainted parents leave you behind?\" He fully expected a denial, of course.\\n\\n She gave him the truth instead. \"As a matter of fact, they did.\" As soon as the words were out of her mouth, she regretted them. Now Connor was going to have an even lower opinion of her dear parents.\\n\\n \"They didn\u0027t leave me on purpose. They just forgot. Surely you see the difference.\"\\n\\n \"Do you expect me to believe they forgot you? No parents would leave their child behind, even English parents.\"\\n\\n \"Your wife looks as though she means what she says,\" Quinlan interjected. \"Did they leave you at home, mi\u0027lady?\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"I spoke in haste.\"\\n\\n \"Then you exaggerated?\" Connor asked, thinking he was being considerate because he hadn\u0027t asked her to admit she\u0027d lied to him.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re making this more important that it was. I wish I\u0027d never said a word now, because you\u0027re going to think ill of my mother and father. You just don\u0027t understand. It only happened a couple of times, and they were still loving parents. They had eight children, and with so many, they were bound to forget about one of us every now and again. It was all my own fault anyway. I should have stayed with the others.\"\\n\\n \"They left you twice?\"\\n\\n The bit of added information she\u0027d mentioned had stunned him.\\n\\n \"You look furious, and I cannot imagine why. You weren\u0027t left behind. I was, and I assure you, it didn\u0027t bother me at all.\"\\n\\n \"Of course it bothered you,\" he countered. \"Did they ever forget any of the others?\"\\n\\n \"No, but I tended to wander…\"\\n\\n He wouldn\u0027t listen to any excuses. \"Where did these loving parents leave you?\"\\n\\n The pigheaded man was never going to understand, and she was suddenly too tired to keep on trying to make him. Lord, he was a trial, and if she didn\u0027t find a little peace and quiet soon, she was going to start screaming like a madwoman.\\n\\n Connor didn\u0027t look as if he was in any mood to leave, and so she decided she would.\\n\\n He had other inclinations. He wasn\u0027t going to let her walk away from him until she satisfied his curiosity. \"I want an answer.\"\\n\\n \"I have finished discussing this topic.\"\\n\\n The look he gave her suggested she change her mind.\\n\\n \"Honestly, Connor, you\u0027re just like a flea chasing after a hound. My parents left me in the middle of the countryside. Are you happy now? Or was there something more embarrassing you wanted me to admit?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t wait around long enough to find out. She didn\u0027t bother to ask permission to leave either, but she couldn\u0027t seem to stop herself from bowing her head to both men before she walked away. She blamed the courtesy on her mother because she\u0027d been relentless in her attempts to turn her daughters into proper ladies.\\n\\n Owen called out to his mistress as she passed him. \"Mi\u0027lady, if you\u0027re looking for water, it\u0027s in the opposite direction.\"\\n\\n She answered the soldier, but her voice wasn\u0027t strong enough to carry across the clearing.\\n\\n \"Now what?\" Connor muttered as soon as he saw how startled Owen looked. The soldier glanced his way before chasing after his mistress.\\n\\n Quinlan didn\u0027t dare smile, though he was vastly amused by the resignation he\u0027d heard in Connor\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"Owen looked surprised. Your wife must have said something to alarm him.\"\\n\\n \"Of course she did,\" Connor replied. \"Honest to God, Quinlan, she\u0027s a damned nuisance.\"\\n\\n In Quinlan\u0027s estimation, she was still just about perfect. Connor didn\u0027t realize his blessing yet, but Quinlan could tell from the way Connor studied his wife with such a perplexed look on his face that he was already captivated by her. He obviously didn\u0027t like the way he reacted to her if his dark mood of late was any indication. From what Quinlan had observed about his mistress, he could only conclude she was having just as much difficulty understanding her reaction to her husband.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s going to cause quite a disturbance at home.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t let that happen.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure you can stop it from happening,\" Quinlan said. \"The men will have trouble concentrating on their duties. They\u0027ll want to spend their days staring at your wife, and their women won\u0027t like it much.\\n\\n Have you any idea how beautiful she is, or haven\u0027t you taken the time to notice?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not blind; of course I noticed. Her appearance is yet another flaw I must contend with.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see it as such.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a shallow man. That\u0027s why you don\u0027t see it as such.\"\\n\\n Quinlan thoroughly appreciated the insult and smiled in reaction.\\n\\n \"Laird?\" Owen shouted. \"May I have a moment of your time? It\u0027s important.\"\\n\\n He waited for Connor\u0027s approval before coming forward. \"Mi\u0027lady told me she wasn\u0027t going to the creek.\\n\\n She\u0027s going to get her trunk. Then she thought she might want to walk all the way back to England. Those were her very words to me, and given with a smile, mind you. I tried to dissuade her, but she wouldn\u0027t listen to reason. Do you think she really means to try?\"\\n\\n Connor didn\u0027t answer the soldier. He doubted Owen would hear a word he said anyway, as Quinlan\u0027s laughter was gratingly loud. He considered shoving his friend to the ground just for the sheer hell of it, then decided he couldn\u0027t really fault him. Connor would find Brenna\u0027s independence amusing too, if he weren\u0027t married to the impossible woman; but he was married to her, and that made everything different.\\n\\n Why couldn\u0027t she be more agreeable? Her impulsiveness was going to drive him to distraction. She surprised him every time he turned around, and he didn\u0027t like it at all. She should be more predictable, shouldn\u0027t she? Oh, he should have known she was going to be trouble the minute he met her. Hell, his wife was thoroughly unique. Connor wasn\u0027t a fool; he realized his good fortune. Still, he wished she would hurry up and get used to him; once she did, she\u0027d calm down enough for him to be able to concentrate on more important matters.\\n\\n He was beginning to think he would never understand how her mind worked. How could he when she was constantly changing on him? One minute she was soft and willing, and the next, she was stubborn and difficult.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t be expected to put up with a whirlwind. Most men surely wouldn\u0027t have been as patient as he\u0027d been, but he was finished with that now. He could take only so much provocation in one day, and he had had his fill.\\n\\n \"I wonder if Lady Brenna realizes she\u0027s going the wrong way,\" Quinlan remarked. \"She\u0027ll be knocking on Kincaid\u0027s door if she keeps walking through the night.\"\\n\\n \"Mi\u0027lady knows she\u0027s going north,\" Owen said. \"She told me she\u0027s deliberately making a wide circle so as not to disturb the soldiers patrolling the creek.\"\\n\\n Quinlan turned to Connor. \"Shouldn\u0027t you go after your wife?\"\\n\\n \"My brother\u0027s soldiers won\u0027t let her get far.\"\\n\\n \"I believe she expects you to come after her.\"\\n\\n \"The hell with that,\" he muttered.\\n\\n He contradicted his own decision a second later, when he shoved the two men aside and went striding after his wife.\\n\\n He had to go farther than he\u0027d expected. He found her leaning against a tree a fair distance away from the clearing. She looked defeated. He didn\u0027t like to see her like that, especially when he realized he was largely responsible. Still, he was still thankful she wasn\u0027t weeping.\\n\\n She put her hand up in a silent command to stop him from coming any closer, which he completely ignored, and as soon as he reached her, he lifted her into his arms.\\n\\n He expected her to fight him; she surprised him by putting her arms around his neck and resting her head against his shoulder. She was suddenly soft and willing again.\\n\\n \"My brother told me no woman in her right mind would marry me, and if you really meant to go after your trunk, I would have to say…?\"\\n\\n \"That I\u0027m not in my right mind?\" she responded. \"If I\u0027m demented, it\u0027s all your fault. You pushed me right over the edge, Connor.\"\\n\\n He smiled in spite of himself. His wife said the most outrageous things to him.\\n\\n \"You meant to keep on walking?\"\\n\\n \"No. I meant to have a few minutes alone. You knew that, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n No, he hadn\u0027t known, but he decided to pretend he had. \"Yes,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I was never alone, though. You knew that too, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I did.\"\\n\\n \"Who are the two soldiers following me?\"\\n\\n \"My brother\u0027s sentries. You\u0027re on Alec\u0027s land, if you\u0027ll remember.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t remember any such thing. She yawned then and turned her attention to a more worrisome problem. \"I seem to have misplaced my shoe. I can\u0027t imagine how it happened.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t have any trouble imagining it at all. She was constantly leaving her things about. \"I\u0027ll find it,\" he promised. \"Brenna, what was it really all about back there? Do you know?\"\\n\\n \"Do you mean to ask me if I had another reason for becoming upset?\"\\n\\n He had just asked her that very question, hadn\u0027t he? \"Yes,\" he said.\\n\\n She began to rub the back of his neck while she thought about how she could make him understand.\\n\\n Connor doubted she was even aware of what she was doing, but he found the caresses very pleasing.\\n\\n \"I understand now what was bothering me. I didn\u0027t understand then.\"\\n\\n He rolled his eyes heavenward. Getting a straight answer out of her was turning into strenuous work.\\n\\n \"And?\" he prodded.\\n\\n \"The trunk and the saddle and my mare were all gifts from members of my family. You\u0027re trying to take them away from me, and I can\u0027t let you do that. I\u0027m not ready to let go.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly what am I taking away?\"\\n\\n \"My family.\"\\n\\n \"Brenna…\"\\n\\n She wouldn\u0027t let him continue. \"You are trying to take them away, aren\u0027t you? And if I let you succeed, what will I have left?\"\\n\\n \"Me.\"\\n\\n The impact of what he said struck her, and yet she still tried to resist the truth. She didn\u0027t want him; she wanted her family.\\n\\n \"You have me.\" His voice was hard now, insistent.\\n\\n She looked up at him then, and her childish resolution to cling to the old and the familiar seemed to lose its importance. The look in his eyes mesmerized her. There was such tenderness and vulnerability there.\\n\\n \"Do I have you, Connor?\"\\n\\n \"Aye, lass, you do.\"\\n\\n She smiled then, her doubts gone. He had surely spoken from his heart, or so she believed, and her own heart warmed in reaction. She had seen this side of him only once before, on their wedding night, when he\u0027d taken her into his arms and made love to her. The warlord had vanished then, and she had embraced the man. Now he was giving her this magical gift once again. How could she resist him?\\n\\n She nodded her acceptance, her mind at peace, because she finally understood that what she was doing was both holy and right, made so by the church and God himself the minute Father Sinclair had united them as husband and wife, and although she\u0027d been telling herself she would make the best of her circumstances, she admitted now she hadn\u0027t really accepted the marriage.\\n\\n It was time for her to stop fearing her future and let go of her desperate hold on her past, and as soon as she made the decision to do just that, the most wondrous thing happened to her. She willingly gave herself to him.\\n\\n \"You have me now, Connor MacAlister, because I have decided that you should.\"\\n\\n She sealed her promise with a kiss, in spite of his specific order that she must never, ever kiss him without first gaining permission, and when she\u0027d finished, she tucked her head under his chin and closed her eyes.\\n\\n He was never again going to be surprised by anything she said, Connor thought. She\u0027d decided? Aye, those had been her very words all right.\\n\\n \"You and I are starting over,\" she whispered.\\n\\n Here we go again, he thought to himself. He still didn\u0027t understand what she was talking about, but if she\u0027d asked him for his agreement, he would have given it just to make her happy. He really shouldn\u0027t have cared if she was happy or not, but he did care. He consoled himself with his hope that once she adjusted to her new life, she would stop having such peculiar ideas.\\n\\n Connor leaned back against the tree and stared down at his wife. She seemed serene now, which meant he was finally going to get some peace and quiet and could figure out what in hell he would say to his brother tomorrow, and wasn\u0027t that all that mattered anyway?\\n\\n \"Connor?\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take good care of you.\"\\n\\n He was stunned by this promise, and though he probably should have been insulted, because it was his duty to take care of her and not the other way around, she\u0027d sounded so sincere, he knew she meant to please him.\\n\\n She fell asleep before he could set her straight. She moved closer to him until her soft mouth was pressed against the base of his neck. She tightened her hold on him as well, and he realized he liked the way she tried to get as close as she could to him. He liked the way she sighed in her sleep too. When her guard wasn\u0027t up and she wasn\u0027t trying to argue with him every other minute, she became sweet and loving. She was beginning to trust him, he knew, or she wouldn\u0027t have allowed herself to fall asleep in his arms, and with a smile. He realized he liked that most of all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-17.html","bookId":1845,"book":{"id":1845,"title":"The Wedding (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #2)","description":"Storyline: It\u0027s a classic plot: a marriage of convenience that lays the groundwork for true love. \\n 1119.
