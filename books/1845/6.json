Let them go to Laird MacNare or back to my father.\" The innocent woman actually thought she was saving their lives. Connor knew better. MacNare would surely torture the men before he disposed of them, and although her father probably wouldn\u0027t be as twisted with his punishment, Connor assumed he would still kill them because they had dishonored him. \"And if I agree to this difficult bargain?\" he asked, trying to keep his amusement out of his voice. \"You\u0027ll accept this marriage? I want your agreement and your acceptance.\" \"There\u0027s a difference?\" \"There is,\" he replied. \"In time, you\u0027ll understand.\" \"Do you expect me to give you my promise without knowing exactly what it is I\u0027m promising?\" \"Do you expect me to let twelve cowards live when they poison the air I breathe?\" He was frowning at her now, and she couldn\u0027t help but worry he might be changing his mind. She decided not to press her good fortune. She had just won an important victory, hadn\u0027t she? Still, she didn\u0027t feel like celebrating. \"I\u0027ll agree and I\u0027ll accept.\" \"You have a kind heart.\" She was astonished by his compliment. \"Thank you.\" \"It wasn\u0027t praise,\" he snapped. \"I want you to rid yourself of such a weakness.\" He\u0027d rendered her speechless. How could she possibly argue with such opinions? His followers were just as odd as their leader. When they were ordered to let the soldiers leave unharmed, they didn\u0027t even try to hide their disappointment. They pouted like babies. She glared at the Highlanders while she was being pulled along by their leader. Quinlan had the gall to smile back at her. The man she had just promised to accept didn\u0027t speak to her again until they were well away from the others. \"Brenna?\" \"Yes?\" \"I\u0027m not always going to be this pleasant.\" She could tell he was serious, but still she wanted to laugh until she cried. She was fast losing her control and forced herself to calm down. She needed to stay clearheaded so she could figure a way to get out of this nightmare. Oh, Lord, what had she gotten herself into? Damn it all, none of this was her fault. She knew the truth, though she doubted anyone in her family would understand, especially her father. On her way out the door to go to MacNare, hadn\u0027t she threatened to do something rash? Papa was surely going to think she\u0027d done just that. \"If my father blames me for this marriage, you\u0027re going to have to set him straight. I didn\u0027t plan this, and you\u0027re going to tell him so. Promise me you will.\" He didn\u0027t answer her. She knew he\u0027d heard every word, though, because she\u0027d shamelessly raised her voice. \"Promise me,\" she demanded again. He lifted her onto her horse, and while that was very thoughtful of him indeed, she didn\u0027t thank him. She grabbed his hand as he let go of her waist. \"Promise me?\" she asked yet again. \"\u0027Tis doubtful you\u0027ll ever see your family again. Your concern is foolish.\" He thought he was very reasonable. She thought he was deliberately cruel. Tears filled her eyes over the very idea that she might not see her family again. She pushed his hand away. \"I will see them again. You cannot expect me to… Didn\u0027t your mother ever tell you it\u0027s rude to walk away from someone when she\u0027s talking to you?\" Connor couldn\u0027t believe what he\u0027d just heard. She had actually criticized him. No one had ever spoken to him with such open disapproval before, and a woman addressing him in such a fashion was simply beyond his comprehension. Honest to God, he didn\u0027t know how to react. If she were a man, he knew exactly what he would do, of course, but she wasn\u0027t a man, and that made his dilemma confusing. Brenna certainly wasn\u0027t like any of the women he\u0027d known. Most avoided him, and those who had more courage kept their heads lowered and their bearing humble in his presence. His reaction to Brenna was bewildering. She made him feel like smiling, even when she was frowning at him. In truth, she was such a refreshing change from all of the others, he couldn\u0027t even begin to imagine her cowering before him, and though her bizarre behavior pleased him, he knew it would be a mistake to let her think she could always get away with such defiance. It would be a poor beginning at best. He was going to be her laird, and she needed to understand exactly what that meant. Appreciation would come later. He decided to be understanding now, so he put his hand on her thigh, gently squeezed, and stared into her eyes. \"You don\u0027t understand yet, and for that reason, I will be patient with you.\" \"Exactly what don\u0027t I understand?\" \"Your position in my household. Soon you\u0027ll learn to value the great honor I\u0027ve bestowed on you by marrying you.\" Her eyes turned a deep violet blue. Lord, she was pretty when she was angry. \"I will?\" she asked. \"You will.\" She put her hand on top of his and began to squeeze. She wasn\u0027t at all gentle. \"Perhaps you should bestow this great honor on someone who does understand,\" she suggested. He ignored her remark and continued on with his explanation. \"Until you learn to appreciate the gift I\u0027ve given you, I expect you to voice your opinions only when you are asked to do so. I cannot tolerate insolence. Now give me your promise.\" She was neither impressed nor intimidated by his gruff commands. A woman could only take so much, after all, and she\u0027d just about reached her limit. Surely she would wake up from this nightmare any moment now. \"I may never voice my opinions?\" she asked. \"When others who follow me are present, you may not,\" he qualified. \"When we are alone, you may do whatever you wish.\" \"I wish to go home.\" \"That isn\u0027t possible.\" She let out a sigh. Home meant facing her father, and until someone explained the truth to him, she honestly didn\u0027t think she wanted to see him again. \"I\u0027ll give you my promise just as soon as you promise you\u0027ll explain to my father.\" \"I won\u0027t ever bend to you.\" \"Nor I, to you.\" He ignored her outrageous boast. \"However, because you\u0027re so obviously afraid of me and fear your future, I\u0027ve decided to make this one exception. If I ever see your father, I\u0027ll explain what happened.\" She wanted clarification. \"But you won\u0027t go into detail about the proposals. Even though I was just a child, Father still might not understand.\" \"I won\u0027t mention your proposals.\" Her smile was radiant. \"Thank you.\" He pointedly looked down at her hand resting on top of his. In her gratitude, she was now patting him. He couldn\u0027t resist teasing her. \"It isn\u0027t appropriate for you to show me your affection in front of the English soldiers.\" She snatched her hand away. \"I was not showing you affection.\" \"Aye, you were.\" He liked having the last word. She saw him smile as he turned away from her. What a twisted sense of humor he had. Were all the people who lived in the Highlands as strange as this one? Brenna fervently hoped not. How in heaven\u0027s name was she ever going to get along with such peculiar people? Good Lord, she was already thinking about a future with the barbarian. What was happening to her? She should be trying to think of a way to get away from him instead of wondering what it would be like to live with him. Her reaction to him was most puzzling. She\u0027d felt relief and true appreciation when he\u0027d promised to speak to her father, and yet she had absolutely no reason to trust he would keep his word. There was only one possible reason for her odd behavior, she decided. Her mind had snapped. \"He\u0027s made me as addled as Beatrice… Good God, Beatrice…\" She\u0027d forgotten all about her lady\u0027s maid. The poor woman was probably quivering with terror in the bushes somewhere. Brenna dismounted and went running back to her father\u0027s soldiers. They were standing now, silently replacing their weapons. None of them would look at her when she called out to them, and so she moved closer. Quinlan intercepted her by blocking her path. He didn\u0027t touch her, just stood in her way so she couldn\u0027t take another step. The other Highlanders had also moved forward to put themselves between her and her father\u0027s men. If she hadn\u0027t known better, she would have believed they were actually trying to protect her from her very own escort. The idea was too ludicrous to consider, however, and she decided that they were simply being rude. \"I would like to speak to my father\u0027s soldiers.\" Quinlan shook his head. \"Your laird wouldn\u0027t like it.\" He wasn\u0027t her laird; she was English, for the love of God and king, but she knew she wouldn\u0027t get what she wanted if she argued with him. She needed his cooperation, not his anger. \"I doubt your laird will mind at all,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll only take a minute. I promise.\" Quinlan reluctantly gave in. He moved to her side, clasped his hands behind his back, and said, \"You may speak to them from here.\" She didn\u0027t waste any time. \"Harold, please don\u0027t forget Beatrice. She\u0027s hiding near the stream. I would appreciate it if you would take her back home.\" Although Harold wouldn\u0027t look at her, he did nod agreement. \"Will you tell my parents not to worry?\" Harold mumbled something under his breath she couldn\u0027t quite make out. She tried to move closer so she could hear his whisper, but Quinlan put his arm out to stop her. She gave the Highlander a good frown to let him know what she thought of his high-handed behavior and then turned back to Harold once again. \"What did you say?\" she asked. \"I couldn\u0027t quite hear you.\" The soldier finally looked at her. \"Your father will go to war over this atrocity, mi\u0027lady. That is what I said.\" Her heart felt as though it had just dropped into her shoes. \"No, no, he mustn\u0027t go to war over me. Make him understand, Harold.\" She stopped when she heard the panic in her voice, took a deep breath, and then whispered, \"I won\u0027t have anyone fighting because of me. Tell my father I wanted this marriage. I asked the Highlander to come for me.\" \"You wanted to marry MacNare?\" Harold asked, obviously misunderstanding. \"No, no, I never wanted MacNare. I wanted…\" Dear God, she was so flustered, she couldn\u0027t remember the laird\u0027s name. \"I wanted…\" She gave Quinlan a frantic look. \"What is the name of your laird?\" she whispered. \"Connor MacAlister.\" \"MacAlister,\" she called out. \"I wanted MacAlister. Please remind my father he met my future husband a long time ago.\" \"It\u0027s time to leave, mi\u0027lady,\" Quinlan advised, for he\u0027d just spotted Connor watching from the edge of the clearing. The laird didn\u0027t look at all pleased with what he was seeing. \"One last request,\" she pleaded. She didn\u0027t give Quinlan time to argue with her. \"Harold, tell my father not to come after me. I want him to celebrate my…\" \"Your what, mi\u0027lady?\" She could barely get the words out without choking. \"My happiness.\" She ran back to her horse and was already settled in the saddle by the time Connor reached her side. He sat atop a huge black stallion that looked as mean as his master. She made the mistake of looking up, and promptly dropped her reins in reaction to the anger she saw in his eyes. She quickly lowered her head and pretended to be terribly busy getting comfortable so he wouldn\u0027t know she was deliberately trying to shield herself from his temper. He wasn\u0027t about to be ignored. Did she actually want him to believe she was trying to protect him from her father\u0027s wrath? The thought was both insulting and laughable. He forced his mount closer until Brenna\u0027s leg was pressed tight against his, and then demanded her full attention by taking hold of her chin and forcing her to look at him. \"Why?\" She knew what he was asking and didn\u0027t even try to pretend she didn\u0027t. \"War means death,\" she answered. He shrugged. \"For some men it does,\" he agreed. \"Even one man would be too many,\" she explained. \"I don\u0027t want anyone to fight because of me. Father has a large army, but it would be a hardship and a nuisance for him to come after me. He would insist on leading his soldiers, and I cannot help but worry you might…\" \"I might what?\" \"Kill him.\" He was appeased. She wished she had the strength in her to push him off his horse. He was a proud and arrogant man, and she had used both flaws to her benefit by letting him assume she believed he would be the superior warrior on the battlefield. While it was true that he was physically superior—because he was younger, bigger, and obviously stronger—her father would make up for the differences by having staggering numbers on his side. It would be a slaughter, all right, and Connor MacAlister would probably end up on the bottom of the pile of wounded. Why had she lied to Harold, then? Honest to heaven, she didn\u0027t know. She had just sealed her fate with her father, because she knew that as soon as his vassal gave him her message, he would go into a rage. He wouldn\u0027t be at all reasonable or bother to take the time to think it through and realize she couldn\u0027t possibly have planned this trickery. Not only did she not have the heart for it, she hadn\u0027t had the time. Papa was going to blame her, and then he would turn his back on her and never acknowledge her as his daughter again. But he would stay alive to hate her. And no one would die. \"I will not inconvenience my father. However, upon reflection, I realize my own wishes won\u0027t matter. Laird MacNare is sending an escort to meet me, and I\u0027m certain his men will kill the lot of you. I expect they should be here any moment now.\" \"No, they won\u0027t be coming after you.\" He sounded terribly certain. It would take too much effort to argue, and she was simply too worn out to worry any longer. Her heartache for her family was so intense, she could barely keep herself from bursting into tears. Unfortunately, she was given a long time to feel sorry for herself. They left the clearing a minute later, and no one spoke to her again until late that evening. She was squeezed in between two stone-faced warriors who didn\u0027t even glance her way. Gilly, her sweet-tempered mare, didn\u0027t like the closeness any more than she did.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-6.html","bookId":1845,"book":{"id":1845,"title":"The Wedding (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #2)","description":"Storyline: It\u0027s a classic plot: a marriage of convenience that lays the groundwork for true love. 1119.

She couldn\u0027t know that her capture was merely the first act of vengeance against her betrothed, Connor\u0027s sworn enemy.
