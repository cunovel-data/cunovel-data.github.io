I also thought we argued, but you have explained we didn\u0027t.\" He nodded. \"Why are you so restless in your saddle?\" He was going to make her admit her embarrassment. \"There is a little tenderness,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027ve been shifting my weight to ease the discomfort.\" He lifted her from Gilly onto his lap and put his arms around her. His chin dropped down on the top of her head next. \"Is it better now?\" \"Yes, thank you.\" \"I\u0027m not going to be able to touch you tonight, am I?\" He actually sounded a little disappointed. She had trouble believing him, of course. Then she thought he might be jesting with her and looked up to see if he was smiling. His expression didn\u0027t give anything away, however, and so she asked, \"You want to touch me again?\" \"Of course. Why does that surprise you? I told you you didn\u0027t disappoint me, and I want children as soon as possible.\" She leaned away from him. \"But after we, directly after… You told me you weren\u0027t disappointed, but I know you weren\u0027t very happy either.\" \"Why would you think such a thing?\" \"You rolled away and ignored me. You needn\u0027t pretend now just to make me feel better. I\u0027m bound to improve.\" \"Ah, lass, you\u0027ll kill me if you do.\" She turned scarlet. \"Then you were happy… after?\" He let out a long sigh. He couldn\u0027t understand why she needed to hear him admit it. \"Yes.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me how you felt?\" \"Why would I?\" He was ignorant of women\u0027s feelings, she reminded herself so she wouldn\u0027t get angry. \"You could have given me a compliment or two.\" He gave her a surprised look, and she immediately recognized it. It was the same look he had given her when she\u0027d told him she wanted to be comforted. \"I cannot guess what you want. You have to tell me, Brenna.\" She shook her head at him. \"I no longer have any need for compliments, so you can stop looking appalled. It only just occurred to me that I didn\u0027t compliment you either. I certainly wasn\u0027t disappointed.\" \"I know.\" She ignored his arrogant remark. \"I believe we should start over.\" She nodded to emphasize her conclusion before repeating it. \"Yes, that\u0027s what we must do. As of this minute, we\u0027re starting all over.\" What was she talking about? Start what over? If she hadn\u0027t looked so pleased with herself, and so damned happy, he probably would have demanded she explain herself. Brenna suddenly realized how considerate it was of him to gain privacy for their intimate talk about her condition. \"I\u0027m grateful you waited until we were alone to discuss my discomfort, and I feel better because you were concerned.\" \"That isn\u0027t why we stopped.\" She looked so disappointed, he decided to soften the truth. \"It was only one of the reasons we stopped. I also wanted to talk to you about your horse.\" \"Gilly\u0027s worn out, isn\u0027t she?\" \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"We\u0027re going to have to leave her behind. She won\u0027t make it up the last climb,\" he continued on, in spite of the fact that she was vehemently shaking her head at him. His wife still didn\u0027t understand it was not proper to disagree with her husband. He hoped she\u0027d figure that out soon. \"She\u0027s ready to collapse even now.\" She knew he was right about Gilly\u0027s condition, yet she wanted him to realize what he asked of her was impossible. \"My brother gave me Gilly years ago. I\u0027m very fond of her. Surely you can understand I can\u0027t leave her behind. Couldn\u0027t we stay here until she regains some of her strength?\" \"No.\" \"Please be reasonable.\" \"I am being reasonable. The horse can\u0027t possibly regain what she never had. She wasn\u0027t bred for endurance.\" \"But if we lingered just a little while…\" \"It\u0027s too dangerous to stay here. Would you put the lives of my men above those of your animal?\" Her shoulders slumped in defeat. There didn\u0027t seem to be any point in continuing to try to sway him, especially since he\u0027d given her such a valid reason. \"I know you\u0027re right,\" she whispered. \"I would feel terrible if something happened to your soldiers. Gilly might well injure herself if I continue to press her. I was just being selfish, I realize that now. Where should we leave her?\" \"Right here is as good a place as any.\" She dared to shake her head at him again. Connor was again taken aback by her defiance. In time she must learn to have faith in his judgment. She had certainly changed since their initial meeting. \u0027Twas a fact she\u0027d done a complete turnabout. She could barely speak a coherent word to him when she\u0027d first met him, no doubt because of her fear. Now, however, she didn\u0027t seem intimidated at all. Admittedly, he wasn\u0027t sorry about the change, for he probably wouldn\u0027t have liked being married to a woman who trembled every time he looked at her. He had expected Brenna to be like the other women he\u0027d known, and he realized now his assumption had been wrong. She wasn\u0027t anything like the others; she was wonderfully, and exasperatingly, unique, too damned beautiful for her own good and his peace of mind, and while he found her boldness refreshing, he really didn\u0027t believe it was necessary for her to tell him about every little detail in her life. Arguing with him regarding her horse was just one example; unfortunately there were already countless others. \"Gilly couldn\u0027t possibly survive on her own. Do pay attention, Connor. I want you to understand. You look a bit stunned,\" she added with a nod. \"Have I said something to upset you?\" He counted to ten before he answered her, hoping to calm his rising temper. His voice still had a noticeable sting in it when he asked, \"Did you just tell me to pay attention?\" She lifted her shoulders in a dainty shrug. \"I might have,\" she admitted. \"And that upset you? Is that why your jaw\u0027s clenched tight? I\u0027ll apologize if you\u0027d like me to.\" \"Listen carefully,\" he ordered in a suspiciously soft voice. \"You do not tell your husband to pay attention.\" He waited for her to nod before continuing. \"I am not upset with you, but honest to God, you do try my patience.\" Because she wanted him to change his mind about Gilly, she didn\u0027t think it would be a good idea to contradict him now. It almost killed her to keep silent. He was such a stubborn man, determined to have things done his way and none other. He was also her husband, however, and so she would try to get along with him. If he wanted to believe he wasn\u0027t upset, she\u0027d let him, even though it was most apparent to her that he was. The muscle in the side of his face was twitching, for heaven\u0027s sake, and if that wasn\u0027t a telling sign that he was bothered, she didn\u0027t know what was. Getting along with this impossible man was going to be the death of her, she decided. Pride would be his downfall, unless he learned to be less arrogant. \"Thank you for explaining,\" she said. She didn\u0027t sound very sincere, but she didn\u0027t choke on her words either, and that had to count for something, didn\u0027t it? \"I just thought you might wish to know that Gilly is used to being pampered, and therefore won\u0027t know how to forage for food.\" He was now thoroughly exasperated with her. They were talking about an animal and not a child, weren\u0027t they? His wife didn\u0027t seem to understand the difference. He was just about to take a much firmer stand when she waylaid him by touching the side of his face. He felt as though he were being stroked by the wings of an angel. She looked like an angel too, damn it all, with those enchanting blue eyes and that innocent expression on her face. While he knew the caress had been calculated to make him forget his own thoughts, that very thing happened. He took hold of her hand so he could concentrate. His wife was being ridiculous, of course, but he knew it would be a mistake to tell her so. She\u0027d only increase her efforts to sway him. Diplomacy was called for. Unfortunately, he didn\u0027t have any. \"She\u0027ll be just fine,\" he snapped. \"She won\u0027t be fine. She\u0027ll be dead.\" \"You will stop arguing with me, Brenna,\" he said, allowing his anger to show. She wasn\u0027t the least bit intimidated. \"I\u0027m not arguing. I\u0027m just trying to make you understand how important Gilly is to me. She\u0027s like a member of my family. I even named her after my brother.\" \"He must have loved that,\" he said dryly. She ignored his sarcasm. \"No, Gillian didn\u0027t like it much at all, but he eventually got used to it. Can\u0027t you think of someone kind and loving to take care of her?\" \"Do you think I would admit to knowing anyone kind and loving?\" She was determined not to lose her temper, no matter how much he provoked her. Gilly\u0027s welfare was at issue, after all, and she was responsible for her. \"I know of someone who might take her,\" Brenna offered. \"No, we aren\u0027t taking her back to England. Quinlan\u0027s family doesn\u0027t live too far from here, but I\u0027ve already replaced everything they lost. You aren\u0027t going to let this go, are you?\" \"If you tell me I must, I will try. Will you at least think about your decision a little longer before you make it final?\" Connor finally conceded. \"I\u0027m not an unreasonable man, and so I have decided to think about it.\" Less than a minute later, he admitted Quinlan\u0027s father would be willing to have Gilly. She was so pleased he\u0027d decided to cooperate, she put her arms around his neck and kissed him. She only meant to give him a quick kiss to show her gratitude, but what she meant to do and what she ended up doing were vastly different. It was all Connor\u0027s fault anyway, because he\u0027d shown her how wonderful a kiss could be. She thought she was only following his lead, and before she could pull away or draw a proper breath, his mouth was moving over hers in a long, deep kiss that made her tremble for more in no time at all. He became more demanding and she became even more uninhibited, until her tongue was every bit as wild as his in her quest to satisfy him. The taste and texture of him mingled with his scent, and God help her, it wasn\u0027t long before she felt her control slipping away. She forgot all about the outside world. They could have been surrounded by an army of heathens and she wouldn\u0027t have noticed, or cared. Nothing mattered but the warlord in her arms. Fortunately, Connor didn\u0027t lose his sanity. He abruptly pulled back, then grabbed hold of her hands and forced her to stop tugging on his hair and let go of him. He knew she didn\u0027t have any idea how shaken the kiss had left him. He told himself not to look at her mouth again until he was in complete control, but damn if he didn\u0027t look anyway. Exactly what he knew would happen did happen, of course, because he ravaged her mouth a second time to keep her from tempting him to do far more intimate things to her, and when at last he found enough strength to end it, he was furious with himself. \"You make me forget where we are, wife.\" Believing he must have enjoyed the tender moments as much as she had, she smiled with pleasure. He lost his temper then and there. \"What in God\u0027s name did you think you were doing?\" The radical change in him took her breath away. \"I was…\" Lord save her, what had she been doing? He wouldn\u0027t wait long enough for her to regain her wits. \"Yes?\" he demanded. \"I was showing my appreciation.\" \"If this is how you show your gratitude, I wonder how you were able to remain innocent until your wedding night.\" She was stunned. How dare he ruin such a perfect kiss by making such a vile remark about her character? Her temper rose to the occasion. \"It\u0027s miraculous really. My father was constantly dragging me away from the men I attacked. They were all completely helpless, of course, and like you, they never kissed me back.\" Her comment was laughable, given the fact that she\u0027d been so timid and terrified on their wedding night. Although he still thought she should learn to be more demure around him, he had to admit he continued to be impressed by her boldness in standing up to him. Didn\u0027t she understand she wasn\u0027t supposed to give him her opinion unless he asked for it? She should give him her undying loyalty and faith in everything he said or did… shouldn\u0027t she? Hell, he didn\u0027t know what she was supposed to do. He\u0027d never been married before and was basing his beliefs on observation and past experience with women he\u0027d taken to his bed. They\u0027d been thankful, damn it, and certainly had never shown any boldness. And he\u0027d become bored in no time at all. Brenna was a refreshing change from what he was used to, no doubt about it, but he didn\u0027t have the faintest idea how to get her to do what he thought she should do. Connor wasn\u0027t certain why he tried to provoke her again, but he thought perhaps it was because he wanted to hear another of her outrageous remarks. \"Dare you try to placate me by giving me such an ignorant rebuttal?\" \"Nay, Connor. I was simply trying to give you what you wanted. It was apparent to me that you were deliberately trying to make me angry. I let you succeed. You may thank me later.\" His smile gave him away of course. \"You really don\u0027t understand why I became irritated, do you?\" She wasn\u0027t at all happy about his amusement. \"No, I don\u0027t, but I have a feeling you\u0027re going to tell me.\" \"It isn\u0027t proper for you to kiss me unless I have given you permission.\" She could feel her spine stiffening in annoyance. \"Then I won\u0027t be kissing you much in future.\" \"Ah, wife, you will.\" The conversation abruptly ended when he shoved her face against his chest. \"Will you stop doing that?\" she demanded. \"It\u0027s rude.\" He didn\u0027t acknowledge her demand and in fact didn\u0027t speak to her again until late that evening when they finally stopped for the night. He waited for Brenna to notice Gilly wasn\u0027t tethered near the other horses. The woman would probably pitch a fit then and possibly weep, God help him, which he was fully prepared to stop before she started. She didn\u0027t say a cross word to him, but after he saw the look on her face, he began to wish she were shouting at him. The sadness in her eyes was far more bothersome. He suffered her disappointment in him throughout supper because he was determined not to explain his actions to her, but an hour later, he changed his mind. He told himself he was making this one exception because she was so fond of the mare. Hell, she\u0027d elevated the creature to a family member.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-15.html","bookId":1845,"book":{"id":1845,"title":"The Wedding (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #2)","description":"Storyline: It\u0027s a classic plot: a marriage of convenience that lays the groundwork for true love. 1119.
