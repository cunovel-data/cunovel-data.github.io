You will stop it now.\" She started to laugh before she realized he was perfectly serious. \"Do you have any idea how arrogant you sound?\" She didn\u0027t wait for him to answer her. \"I\u0027m getting cold again. If you\u0027ll let go of me, I\u0027ll finish getting dressed.\" \"There isn\u0027t any need to dress. We\u0027re going to bed.\" It wasn\u0027t what he said, but how he said it that made her panic. He reeked with authority and looked as tense as a warrior about to go in for the kill. She deliberately tried to misunderstand. \"Together?\" \"Of course.\" \"Now? You want to go to bed now?\" He really was beginning to hate that word. \"Yes, now.\" \"I\u0027d rather not.\" \"I\u0027d rather so.\" \"You might as well know I\u0027m dreading it, Connor. I don\u0027t want to hurt your feelings, but I must be honest with you. Surely you don\u0027t want to force your attentions on an unwilling… Now what are you doing?\" \"Putting the MacAlister plaid around you. Will you stop backing away from me every time I reach for you? It\u0027s damned irritating. Lift your hair out of my way.\" \"I\u0027d rather you left me alone.\" \"You\u0027re trying my patience.\" Why wouldn\u0027t he understand? She tried once again to get through to him. \"Connor, I don\u0027t have any experience.\" She was sure she didn\u0027t need to explain in more detail. Surely he could hear the worry in her voice, see it in her eyes, and feel it in the way she trembled. Any decent, caring man would immediately try to soothe her. \"I do.\" \"That\u0027s it?\" she cried out. \"I\u0027m supposed to be comforted because you have experience?\" \"You want me to comfort you?\" He sounded appalled by the very idea. His reaction didn\u0027t sit well with her. Her frustration mounted until she wanted to scream. She took a slow, deep breath, instead, to calm herself. It didn\u0027t help. \"Yes, I most certainly do want you to comfort me.\" He was afraid she was going to say that. For the first time in a very long while, he was at a loss for words. No other woman had ever made such a strange request of him before. In the past, women had always come to him willingly and offered their bodies, and if he\u0027d been in the mood to accommodate them—which, he had to admit, was most of the time—he\u0027d accepted. He\u0027d been mindful of his responsibility to be gentle with them, of course, and he\u0027d always made certain their enjoyment matched his own. None of them had been virgins, though; he wouldn\u0027t have taken them to his bed if they had been, and now that he thought about it, damned near every one of them had been well-versed in the art of pleasuring a man. In fact, they\u0027d usually had more experience than he had. But they\u0027d all left smiling. This gentle lady standing before him wasn\u0027t at all like other women. She was his bride, the woman who would carry his name and bear his children. He should respect her by doing whatever was required of him to allay her fears. Admittedly, he was completely lacking in experience when it came to meeting the emotional needs of women, but he was certain that, if he put his mind to it, he could draw from past observations. No, no, he was wrong about that, Connor realized after contemplating the dilemma for a moment. He guessed he\u0027d never taken the time to notice what other men did with their women, not even his brother, Alec. Now what? He wasn\u0027t about to tell her she was out of luck. She\u0027d probably start crying then, and he wouldn\u0027t have any idea how to get her to stop. His brother always left the hall whenever his wife wept and returned only after she\u0027d calmed down enough to listen to reason. He wasn\u0027t going to follow Alec\u0027s example now. He\u0027d never get her bedded if he walked away from her. Hell, she\u0027d think she\u0027d been given a reprieve. There seemed to be only one way out of this mire. He was going to have to help her get over this foolish worry of hers, no matter how long it took. He prayed for the unthinkable—understanding. \"I have decided to comfort you.\" \"You have?\" She looked thrilled. \"Yes, I have. However, you\u0027re going to have to explain this duty to me first so I\u0027ll know how to proceed. You may begin.\" \"This isn\u0027t the time for jests.\" \"I wasn\u0027t jesting.\" \"You\u0027re really telling me the truth?\" The scowl on his face told her he didn\u0027t like being doubted. She hurried to calm him. \"Yes, of course you\u0027re telling the truth. You\u0027re a laird, for heaven\u0027s sake. You wouldn\u0027t ever lie.\" \"Will you get on with it?\" She nodded, but didn\u0027t say another word. \"Brenna…\" \"I\u0027m thinking about it,\" she cried. \"Your impatience is making me nervous. How to give comfort is rather difficult to explain. I don\u0027t want to make a muck of it.\" She lapsed into silence again for what seemed like an hour. He couldn\u0027t understand what was taking her so long. He hadn\u0027t asked her to solve an impossible riddle, for the love of God. Why was she acting as though he had? He honestly didn\u0027t know how much longer he was going to be able to stand there without touching her. Couldn\u0027t she see what she was doing to him? No, of course she couldn\u0027t. She was fully occupied thinking about comfort, of all things. She seemed to have forgotten how to speak. She\u0027d forgotten she was half na*ed too, but he hadn\u0027t. The second she stopped holding her gown together over her chest, the gap in the material widened enough for him to see the gentle swell of her breasts. It almost killed him to look away. He suddenly realized that if he didn\u0027t get her covered up at once, he was going to completely lose his sense of discipline. He would run his fingers down her smooth, enticing skin, gently, of course, and then rip the thin-as-air gown off her. She sure as hell wouldn\u0027t be thinking about comfort then, would she? Connor quickly wrapped the plaid around her. He draped one long end over her shoulder, spread the material wide to cover her breasts, and secured the wool with the roped belt he\u0027d carried along. The back of his hands deliberately brushed across her bare skin, not once but twice, while he dressed her, and damned if he didn\u0027t feel as though he\u0027d been struck by hot lightning. Covering her up didn\u0027t make his primitive urges go away. Now all he wanted to do was tear the plaid and her gown off her. He stared into the distance instead. \"I\u0027m pleased you\u0027re thinking about this.\" She certainly gained his full attention with her remark. \"You are?\" \"Yes.\" He gave her a hard look. \"Exactly what do you think I\u0027m thinking about?\" \"Comfort.\" He didn\u0027t laugh. She wouldn\u0027t understand why he was amused, and God help him, he\u0027d probably tell her. \"You still haven\u0027t explained what you want from me.\" \"When you were younger, didn\u0027t your mother…\" \"She\u0027s dead.\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"Why?\" \"Because she died. What about your father? Didn\u0027t he ever comfort you.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"He\u0027s dead. That\u0027s why not.\" \"Connor, wasn\u0027t there anyone you could turn to when you were a little boy?\" He shrugged. \"My brother, Alec.\" \"Did he ever comfort you?\" \"Hell, no.\" He was disgusted by the very idea. \"Wasn\u0027t there anyone who cared about you?\" He shrugged. \"My stepmother, Euphemia, but she was in no condition to ever comfort me, or her own son, Raen, for that matter. My father\u0027s sudden death destroyed her, and she\u0027s been in mourning ever since. She cannot even bear to come back to my land. Her pain is still terrible.\" \"She must have loved your father a great deal.\" \"Of course she did,\" he answered impatiently. \"Does comforting take long?\" How in heaven\u0027s name was she supposed to know the answer to that question? \"I don\u0027t think so,\" she decided. \"Some husbands simply pat their wives on their shoulders as they walk past them to let them know they care about their feelings. My father did that very thing all the time, but now that I think about it, I must admit I\u0027m not certain if he was offering my mother comfort or showing her affection.\" She lifted her shoulders in a dainty shrug. Trying to make him understand was turning out to be more complicated than she\u0027d expected. She tried to think of another example to give him. \"Perhaps other husbands put their arms around their wives and…\" \"Which do you prefer?\" \"I beg your pardon?\" He repeated his question in a brisk, will-you-hurry-up tone of voice. \"Do you want me to pat you or put my arms around you?\" He was hopeless. Comfort needed to come from the heart, and Connor needed to feel it before he showed it. She guessed it was also an acquired art, learned after years of being loved and cared for by family members. And if she weren\u0027t so rattled about what was going to happen to her tonight, she probably would be able to explain it all quite nicely. She couldn\u0027t even remember her new name now. \"This isn\u0027t a lesson in sword fighting. You have to be sincere, spontaneous… and…\" She didn\u0027t continue because she couldn\u0027t think of anything else to say. \"You really don\u0027t have any idea what you\u0027re talking about, do you?\" She let out a long sigh. \"No, not really.\" He wasn\u0027t amused. \"Then why in God\u0027s name have we been standing here?\" \"I didn\u0027t realize how impatient you were, and I… Now what are you doing?\" \"Lifting your hair up from under the plaid.\" \"Why?\" \"I want to.\" \"Do you always do what you want to do? You do, don\u0027t you?\" \"You\u0027d be flat on your back now if I always did what I wanted to do.\" She quit trying to push his hands away. There really didn\u0027t seem to be any reason for her to continue to argue with him anyway. Admittedly, she couldn\u0027t stop him from touching her—he was at least twice her size and strength, after all—but she protected the fragments of her pride by pretending she was in control of what was happening to her. He made quick work of his task, and his hands were surprisingly gentle when he touched the sides of her neck. A shiver of pleasure raced down her back, and though it was a nice sensation, what was even more pleasing and surprising to her was that he corrected what bothered him instead of criticizing her. She had grown up constantly being told what was wrong with her—God only knew, something always did seem to be amiss—then being ordered to correct the flaw. She knew Connor wouldn\u0027t be any different. It was only a matter of time before he got the hang of it and fell into the same routine as her parents and brothers and sisters. Connor wasn\u0027t going to wait any longer. He took hold of Brenna\u0027s hand and started walking toward the bed he\u0027d prepared. He was a little surprised she didn\u0027t fight him now. \"I might as well warn you now that I\u0027m rarely put together,\" she suddenly blurted out. \"Your appearance doesn\u0027t matter to me.\" \"It doesn\u0027t?\" \"Of course not.\" She thought about that for a moment or two before realizing they were walking back toward camp. \"Where are we going?\" He heard the panic in her voice. God, he hated being patient. Were all virgins this impossible? \"What can I do to end this ridiculous fear of yours?\" \"You could start by not snapping at me. It isn\u0027t ridiculous.\" \"Answer me.\" \"You could say something I might find… pleasant and hopeful about…\" \"Mating?\" He thought of a thousand answers to give her, but all of them focused on how he would feel. \"Your hesitation worries me,\" she whispered. \"It won\u0027t kill you.\" \"It won\u0027t kill me? That\u0027s it?\" He smiled over the outrage in her voice. \"You\u0027ll like it. Eventually.\" She gave him a look that told him she didn\u0027t believe him. She kept walking though, and that was all he cared about at the moment. \"It\u0027s messy, isn\u0027t it?\" \"No, it isn\u0027t.\" \"I doubt I\u0027ll like it,\" she whispered, for they were getting close to where his soldiers had bedded down for the night, and she didn\u0027t wish to be overheard. \"I do want children, though.\" \"Exactly how did you plan to get them?\" She ignored the sarcasm in his voice. \"Do you want children?\" \"Of course. Why do you think I married you?\" \"I don\u0027t know why. You promised to explain it all after we were wed.\" \"Later,\" he promised. \"Any woman could give you children. Why did you choose me?\" They stopped talking and now faced each other in the center of the clearing. She looked around, saw the other soldiers feigning sleep on their blankets, and in the center of the circle of men was an empty bed, fashioned together with yet another plaid. She was horrified. Did he really expect her to sleep there, in the middle of the others? Yes, of course he did, she realized. Honest to God, he really didn\u0027t have any idea about the needs of women, did he? She couldn\u0027t make a scene. His men would hear her if she started ranting at their laird, and that would only embarrass her and make him angry. What was she going to do? She wasn\u0027t about to let him touch her with his men pretending to sleep not five feet away. Yet how could she stop him? Connor didn\u0027t look as though he would be reasonable much longer. His stance was rigid, his frown intense, and now that she thought about it, hadn\u0027t he already given her enough time to calm her worries? He had wanted to comfort her, or at least had tried to give her what she wanted, and she couldn\u0027t even imagine any other man going to such lengths to accommodate her. The truth made her smile. Good lord, he really had comforted her, and she hadn\u0027t even realized it. She sighed. Her husband wasn\u0027t such a bad sort, after all. It wouldn\u0027t be right for her to argue with him now. No, she would be diplomatic instead. If she was clever enough, he might not even realize she was getting her way. She reached for his hand just as he was about to take off his boots, and bent down, picked up the blanket from the ground, and then whispered,","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-11.html","bookId":1845,"book":{"id":1845,"title":"The Wedding (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #2)","description":"Storyline: It\u0027s a classic plot: a marriage of convenience that lays the groundwork for true love. 1119.
