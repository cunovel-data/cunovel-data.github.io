{"id":110256,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"I\u0027m really not a serial killer. It just seemed like too good a chance to pass up.\" \"Man,\" I said. \"If I had a dime for every time I heard that...\" Liam, the guy who\u0027d bought me at the auction, laughed and opened the car door for me. He drove a shiny black Lotus Elise that he\u0027d had imported from the UK. I found that impressive. It appeared to have just been freshly washed. I found that impressive too - and a little sad since it looked like it was going to rain at any moment. \"It\u0027s supposed to be really good, though,\" he added, starting up the engine. \"So, I hope you\u0027ll like it and not think it\u0027s too demented for the holidays.\" I hadn\u0027t been keen on following up with my charity date, but I\u0027d known it would have to happen sooner or later. When Liam had called earlier to say he\u0027d gotten tickets to a dramatic production of three Edgar Allan Poe stories tonight, I figured it was as good a time as any to get it over with. Besides, I liked Poe. It was kind of a creepy date to have around the happiest time of the year, true, but that would be the theater\u0027s fault, not Liam\u0027s. It was an early show, so we planned to attend first and catch dinner later. On the drive there, he turned out to be a lot like I\u0027d expected. Intelligent. Nice. Moderately funny. He worked for an investment company downtown and had enough sense not to bore me with the details. We traded light banter, sharing anecdotes and experiences. I still would have rather been with Seth, but Liam was a fine guy for one night, and I figured he should have a fun time after donating so much money. The play was about as twisted as I\u0027d hoped. They started with \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" followed by \"The Cask of Amontillado.\" \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" closed the night off because honestly, what sort of Poe festivities would be complete without that crowd pleaser? \"I\u0027ve never heard of \u0027The Masque of the Red Death,\u0027\" Liam said afterwards. We\u0027d decided to leave the car and walk the six blocks to the restaurant he had reservations at. \"I read the others in high school. I guess it\u0027s some kind of allegory about how you can\u0027t escape death, huh? You can lock yourself away, but it doesn\u0027t work.\" \"More than an allegory, actually,\" I mused. \"Historically, that wasn\u0027t an uncommon way for people to deal with plague and disease. Lock themselves up. Or else leave town and run away. Sometimes they\u0027d throw the sick people out of town and lock the doors, so to speak.\" \"That\u0027s horrible,\" said Liam. We stepped inside the restaurant, a small Italian one that was almost always booked. I had to admit, he was doing a good job with this date thing. \"People didn\u0027t know any better,\" I said. \"They didn\u0027t know what caused diseases, and aside from good hygiene and luck, there were few treatments for ancient and medieval epidemics.\" \"That auctioneer didn\u0027t say anything about you being a history buff,\" he teased. \"Yeah? Would you not have bid?\" \"Are you kidding? A beautiful woman who uses the words \u0027ancient and medieval epidemics\u0027 on the first date? I would have bid more.\" I grinned and let the maitre d\u0027 lead us to our table. I was glad Liam appreciated my historical knowledge, but I\u0027d have to be careful not to get too nerdy. I knew more than the average girl should and could get into levels of detail that modern people had no way of knowing about. I shifted to something else. \"Well, I think the auctioneer was kind of distracted by the other contestants.\" \"Oh, you mean the feminazi who went before you?\" I frowned. \"No, I mean the giant blonde in silver that he bid on.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Liam agreed. \"She was crazy. Attractive, but crazy.\" \"You actually thought she was pretty?\" \"Sure. Not as pretty as you, of course,\" he hastily added, mistaking my meaning. \"But the auctioneer apparently thought otherwise. He couldn\u0027t keep his hands off of her.\" \"Oh, come on. He barely touched her.\" \"Well, not during the auction, of course. I mean afterward.\" \"What?\" I was interrupted when the waiter came by. I had to wait for Liam to order wine before he could finish the story. \"After the auction. I was there helping wrap things up. Deanna\u0027s a friend of my ex-wife\u0027s. When we all finished, Nick and that blonde were all over each other and left together.\" \"That...that isn\u0027t possible.\" Tawny had said they\u0027d left separately. There was no way she and Nick could have been hot and heavy the night of the auction. The following night had been when she showed up for the dance lesson. Even if she was lying about things falling apart with Nick - and really, why would she? - she\u0027d obviously had no recent energy fix. Massive shape-shifting, on the scale of nonhuman shapes, could burn through energy that quickly, but a new succubus wouldn\u0027t have that skill yet. None of this made sense. Liam, obviously, didn\u0027t catch my confusion. \"Why\u0027s it so hard to believe?\" he asked. I shook my head. \"It\u0027s...never mind. I hope they had a great time. Now...what kind of wine did you order? I missed it.\" Not wanting to ruin dinner, I put the Tawny conundrum into a holding bin in my mind and did my best to give Liam his seventeen-hundred-dollars worth. When dinner ended, we walked back toward his car, enjoying a leisurely pace. The weather, though damp, had warmed to about fifty. Seattle\u0027s fickle winters did that sometimes, only to freeze up a day or so later. When Liam slipped his hand into mine, I let him, but it presented me with a dilemma. He was no one I really planned on seeing again. As a courtesy to Seth and an attempt at a normal life, I avoided casual affairs in this body. All of those reasons meant I shouldn\u0027t let the night escalate into anything more than a friendly handshake good-bye. But suddenly, I was feeling the loss of my energy. It had felt so good to have Simon\u0027s - yet it had been stripped from me before I could even do anything with it. It\u0027d be so nice to have that feeling back, to go home with Liam and get what I needed. When we reached his car, he kept holding my hand and turned me so that I faced him. \"What now?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t know.\" I was still torn on what to do. \"I\u0027m open to suggestion.\" Liam smiled, a cute smile that showed in his blue eyes too. \"Well, how about this?\" He leaned down and kissed me, much as Dante had nearly done. Oh, Liam. Liam was a good man. A good, good man. Seth caliber. The moment our lips touched, I felt the sweetness of his life energy trickling into me. My desire woke up, and I pressed myself to him. I might not like to use this body, but these were unusual circumstances. I made my decision. I\u0027d sleep with him and part ways. He was a nice guy, not a psycho stalker. He might be disappointed, but he wouldn\u0027t give me grief for wanting to be friends in the morning. He kissed me harder, pushing me against the side of the car. All that energy from just one kiss. The sex was going to be great. Yes, yes. More. Get more. Feed me. I jerked away from Liam. He looked down at me, legitimately concerned. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" It had been a whisper in my head. Faint but real. It had been paired with a longing, a deep longing for Liam\u0027s energy that rivaled my own need - but it hadn\u0027t been mine. It had belonged to someone - or something - else. Suddenly, it all came back to me. The conversations with Dante and Erik. Some creature preying on me and stealing my energy. True, it was what I did to men...but, well, I couldn\u0027t help how I felt. And just then, I felt nauseous at the thought of some parasitic creature coming to me tonight because I was full of energy. It made my skin crawl. Bad enough this thing was using me. It was also using me to use Liam. I looked back at him; he was so cute and so nice. I shook my head. I couldn\u0027t do this. I needed the energy, but I was going to put if off as long as possible. I wouldn\u0027t give this thing what it wanted. \"Liam...\" I said slowly. \"I should tell you something. I, um, just recently got out of a long relationship, and I went to the auction because I thought I could, you know...\" He sighed, not appearing angry so much as regretful. \"You aren\u0027t ready.\" I shook my head. \"I\u0027m really sorry. I wanted to help at the auction, and I thought I could move on.\" He squeezed the hand he was still holding and released it. \"Well...I\u0027m sad, but I understand. And I like you...if we went out, I\u0027d like to work on something serious. That can\u0027t happen until you\u0027re ready, and I\u0027d never want to force you.\" Oh, God. Nice, nice guy. \"I\u0027m so, so sorry,\" I said. I meant it. I so wanted his energy. \"Nothing to be sorry about,\" he told me, smiling. \"Come on, I\u0027ll take you home.\" He returned me to Queen Anne, and I kissed him on the cheek before leaving the car. He told me to call him when I was ready to date again, and I told him I would. Once he was gone, I didn\u0027t go inside. Instead, I called Dante. \"It\u0027s your favorite succubus,\" I said when he answered. I heard him yawn. \"Debatable. What do you want? It\u0027s late.\" \"I need to talk to you. Something weird happened.\" \"I\u0027m in bed, succubus. Unless you plan on joining me, I\u0027d rather not receive visitors right now.\" \"Please, Dante. It\u0027s important.\" He sighed. \"Fine, come on over.\" \"I don\u0027t know where you live.\" \"Of course you do. You\u0027ve been here a gazillion times.\" \"You live in your store?\" \"Why would I want to pay rent for two different places?\" I drove down to the shop. The sign read CLOSED, but there was a faint light inside. Dante opened the door when I knocked. He wore jeans and a plain T-shirt, nothing unusual, but the disheveled hair suggested he had indeed been in bed. \"Sorry,\" I told him. \"Maybe I should have waited.\" \"Too late for regrets. Come on in.\" He led me through the storefront, back to the small door I usually saw closed. On the other side was a large room that appeared to be a combination living space, office, supply closet, and...workshop. \"Erik was right,\" I said, walking over to a high set of shelves. They were filled with jars and bottles of herbs and unidentifiable liquids. \"You are a magician.\" I considered. \"Or at least you\u0027re pretending to be.\" \"No faith in me. Probably smart.\" He pointed to a bean bag chair and a plaid ottoman. \"Take your pick if you don\u0027t want the bed.\" I chose the ottoman. \"Well, it\u0027s not that I don\u0027t trust you...but everything else you do is a scam. Of course, Erik has to hate you for something legitimate, and he wouldn\u0027t have sent me to you in the first place if you didn\u0027t have some kind of skill.\" \"Interesting logic. Maybe he hates me for my charming personality.\" He rubbed his eyes and yawned again. With the motion of his arm, I noticed faint punctures in the middle of his arm that I\u0027d never seen with long sleeves. \"Maybe he hates you for your vices.\" Dante looked at where I was staring. He shrugged, unconcerned. \"Nah, Lancaster has better things to worry about than a casual hit now and then.\" \"From my experience, there\u0027s no such thing as a casual hit.\" \"What, are you here to do an intervention now, succubus?\" \"No,\" I admitted. I had neither time nor interest to reform Dante. \"But I heard a voice tonight.\" \"I heard a voice too. It called and woke me up.\" \"Dante!\" Angrily, I explained the situation. A hint of his sarcastic smile remained, but otherwise, he actually seemed concerned. \"Huh. Interesting. It actually raised its ugly head.\" \"What do you think that means?\" \"Not a clue until we know what it is. The only thing I can guess is that it was desperate for some reason. Until now, it\u0027s done a pretty good job at hiding itself - aside from your energy loss, obviously.\" He brightened a little. \"I don\u0027t suppose it\u0027s here now, urging you to jump me?\" \"Sorry.\" \"Ah, well. I\u0027m probably not as good a catch as Seventeen-hundred-dollar Man. Your predator has standards.\" I shuddered, hating the idea that I actually had a predator. I looked up at Dante and must have looked truly pathetic because a startled look crossed his features. \"Dante, you have to help me. I know we don\u0027t have the answers yet...but, well, I\u0027m scared of this thing. I can\u0027t bring myself to take a victim because I\u0027m afraid of this monster coming back. I don\u0027t even want to go to sleep.\" His gray eyes assessed me, and to my astonishment, he almost looked gentle. It completely transformed him. \"Ah, succubus. You can sleep tonight. No energy, no visit. I doubt the kiss was enough of a lure.\" \"But eventually...eventually I\u0027ll have to get another fix...and until I\u0027m able to talk to Jerome about all this...\" \"Well, I could maybe make you a charm or something. Protection to ward this thing away.\" \"You can do that?\" I tried to keep the skepticism out of my voice but failed. His face turned wry once more. \"If you don\u0027t want the help...\" \"No! I do. I\u0027m sorry. That was wrong of me. I asked for your help, then backed off.\" \"Well, as you said, I haven\u0027t inspired much faith in you.\" \"I\u0027ll take whatever help I can get,\" I said honestly. He stood up and stretched, then walked over to his shelves, studying their contents. \"You sure about that? You might not like what I have to do to make this. How badly do you want it?\" I thought about that voice, that creature\u0027s need inside my head. \"Pretty badly. Provided you don\u0027t, like, give me a necklace made out of goat entrails, I think we\u0027re good.\" His eyes were still on his shelves and jars. Several moments passed while he considered. \"I\u0027m going to need some time on this, I\u0027m afraid. It\u0027d be a lot easier if I knew what it was we\u0027re dealing with. Without that, I\u0027ve got to try to make some sort of catch-all charm that may or may not work. The broad spectrum ones are always hard, too.\" \"So nothing tonight.\" He strolled back over to me. \"You\u0027re fine tonight, remember? Of course, you\u0027re welcome to stay here, and I\u0027ll stay awake and make sure nothing happens to you.\" I couldn\u0027t help a smile. \"Just like Kayla.\" \"Who?\" \"My boyfriend\u0027s niece...\" I\u0027d nearly forgotten about our weird conversation. \"She said some funny things. But I don\u0027t know if it was just kid imaginings or if she maybe has some kind of psychic ability.\" \"Fine line with kids,\" he said. \"If she has any powers, I\u0027m sure science and discipline will work them out of her. What\u0027d she say?\" \"She said that I was \u0027magic.\u0027 And that there were monsters in the air who got into people\u0027s dreams.\" When he didn\u0027t respond, I exclaimed, \"Do you think she could help with this?\" He shook his head. \"No. If she is psychic or gifted or whatever, she\u0027s too young and inexperienced to know what she\u0027s perceiving to be of any real use.\" \"But she could be sensing what\u0027s following me.\" \"Sure. If she\u0027s a really astute psychic, she\u0027d be sensitive to anomalies in the magical and spiritual worlds.\" Interesting. Tiny little Kayla, possibly with the potential for great spiritual powers some day. \"What\u0027s your advice?\" \"Huh?\" he asked. \"For someone like her. To develop her abilities and make sure science and discipline don\u0027t beat it out of her.\" \"My advice?\" He gave a harsh laugh. \"Let them beat it out of her. You\u0027ll be doing her a favor.\" I sat quietly for a long time, studying my feet. When I finally looked back up at him, I asked, \"Why are you so unhappy?\" \"Who says I\u0027m unhappy? I make money by doing nothing.\" I gestured around. \"Everything says you\u0027re unhappy. Your attitude. Your arm. The pile of beer bottles over there. The fact that even though you claim I annoy you, you keep helping me and always seem glad to have me around.\" \"Misery loves company. You aren\u0027t exactly all that chipper yourself.\" \"I\u0027m very happy with my life,\" I argued. \"Well, then, go back to it, and let me sleep.\" In a not too subtle signal, he walked over to the door and opened it. \"I\u0027ll work on your charm and get back to you.\" I started to snap back at the abrupt dismissal, but he looked so weary, I couldn\u0027t bring myself to do it. Besides, I knew I\u0027d been right. Dante Moriarty was a very unhappy man who used sarcasm and substances to hide it. I wondered what it was that plagued him so much - what it was that had darkened his soul. \"Are you ever going to tell me why Erik hates you so much?\" I asked quietly. Dante pointed at the door. \"Good night, succubus. Sweet dreams.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-13.html","bookId":2056,"book":{"id":2056,"title":"Succubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid #3)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 3: Succubus Dreams especially when the girl in question is Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men.
