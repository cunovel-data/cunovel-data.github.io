{"id":110262,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"I didn\u0027t expect to hear from Dante so quickly. Based on what he\u0027d said about the difficulty of the Nyx-charm, I\u0027d figured it would be a while - if at all. Hugh\u0027s observations on the matter had only reinforced my growing skepticism about Dante\u0027s abilities. \"I\u0027ve got your protection,\" Dante told me on the phone. \"Or at least as close as I can get. You want it, come pick it up.\" He disconnected. I drove to Rainier Valley, finding Dante\u0027s shop empty as usual. \"Guess you don\u0027t see a lot of business so close to Christmas, huh?\" \"Actually,\" he told me, emerging from the back room, \"you\u0027d be surprised at the kind of desperation the holidays can bring out in people. Here, catch.\" He tossed me something baseball-sized. I caught it, feeling a little disappointed when I studied it closer. It looked like a wicker ball, made of very thin, dark branches. Through the gaps, I could make out a few things inside. One looked like a rock. Another looked like a feather. The whole thing rattled when I shook it. \"This is it?\" I asked. \"This is going to keep away an uber-powerful dream entity? It looks like a prop from The Blair Witch Project.\" \"It can\u0027t force her away,\" he said. \"Nothing can. But it might make her think twice. It\u0027s more of...a repellent.\" \"Like citronella?\" He rolled his eyes. \"Yes, like citronella. Depending on her energy charge, she might blow past it. If she\u0027s weak enough...well, it might hold her back.\" I examined the ball again. It still didn\u0027t look like much to me. I sensed no power or magic off of it, but not all objects had an aura I could sense. For reading inanimate items, a psychic mortal tended to be more adept than a lesser immortal. My silence appeared to further annoy Dante. \"Look,\" he snapped. \"You don\u0027t have to use it, but it took a fuckload of power for me to craft it, okay? It\u0027d be nice if you could maybe withhold your customary sarcasm for a whole five minutes to thank me.\" \"My customary sarc - \" I stopped the burst of temper starting to flare in me. Dante ranked near the top of my list of cynical acquaintances, but I wasn\u0027t exactly Pollyanna myself. I\u0027d given him nothing but a hard time since I first came to him for help. And now, studying him, I noticed he was pale and tired-looking. His eyes were bloodshot. The ball might be worthless, but he\u0027d clearly exerted some sort of effort in making it. \"You\u0027re right,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sorry. Thank you. Thank you for this.\" His eyebrows rose, and I could actually see the self-control it took for him not to mock my sincerity. He nodded. \"You\u0027re welcome.\" We each waited for the other to speak. I don\u0027t think we knew what to do without the sarcasm. \"So...did you find your angel friends?\" \"No. I apparently need a fucking Bat Signal or something. Jerome\u0027s gone too. Hugh - this imp friend of mine - could get a hold of him, but it\u0027d probably piss Jerome off if we were wrong about all this.\" I scowled, recalling the conversation in the deli. \"Anyway, Hugh\u0027s pissing me off right now, so I don\u0027t even know if I want his help.\" Dante smiled. \"I thought succubi were supposed to make friends everywhere they went. Or is that a myth like the bat wings and flame eyes?\" \"He\u0027s just being an asshole about Seth.\" Dante looked at me expectantly. I sighed. \"He thinks us dating is a waste of time. And not because of the sex thing. He thinks I\u0027m going to get hurt.\" \"Terribly altruistic of an imp. But then, considering your quasi-morals, I\u0027m starting to think it\u0027s a bad idea to assume anything about you guys.\" He took a few steps toward me and playfully tapped my nose. \"And what about you? Do you think you\u0027re going to get hurt?\" \"No. And if I do, that\u0027s for me to deal with. Hugh shouldn\u0027t be worrying about it. And he shouldn\u0027t make Seth worry about it either!\" \"Don\u0027t get so upset about people worrying about you. It means they care. If enough of us were like that, there\u0027d be a lot less pain in the world.\" That was an unexpected observation from Dante. \"Maybe. But there\u0027d also be a lot less unnecessary stress.\" He chuckled and caught hold of my hand. Flipping it over, he looked at the palm. \"A random assortment of lines for this body?\" he asked. I nodded. \"Can you change it to your original?\" \"What, so you can read it? I thought this was a bunch of bullshit.\" \"Sometimes.\" I waited for more, but it didn\u0027t come. His gray eyes were serious and thoughtful as they met mine. Something in them compelled me, and with great reluctance, I shape-shifted my hands back to the ones I\u0027d been born with. I hadn\u0027t worn my original body since the day I\u0027d become a succubus, and this small change felt unnatural. I hated this form. While my original hands weren\u0027t gargantuan, they were larger than was proportional to this petite frame I carried and appeared weird and mismatched. Dante held my hands in his and glanced back and forth between the palms. After just a few seconds, he snorted and dropped them both. \"Surprise, surprise.\" I shape-shifted them back to the way they had been. \"What?\" I asked. \"Right-handed?\" \"Yeah.\" He pointed to the left hand. \"Those lines represent what you\u0027re born with - your inherent traits. The right hand is the hand that shows how you grow and change and adapt to what you\u0027re born with. Nature and nurture.\" \"So?\" \"Yours are identical on both hands. Your heart line is high on the palm - which means you have an intense, passionate nature. No surprise there. But it\u0027s broken into a million pieces. Sliced and diced.\" He tapped my left hand. \"You were destined for heartache.\" He tapped my right hand. \"And you are going to repeat that pattern forever. You aren\u0027t learning. You aren\u0027t changing.\" \"If I\u0027m destined for it, then what does learning or changing have to do with anything? Isn\u0027t it a done deal?\" I didn\u0027t like the censuring tone in his voice, like I\u0027d done something wrong by having these palms. \"Don\u0027t start,\" he said. \"I\u0027m not a philosopher and don\u0027t want to get into any pre-destination or free-will debates. Besides, palm reading is a bunch of bullshit.\" \"Yeah,\" I said dryly. \"So I hear.\" To my surprise, Dante put his arm around me and drew me close in a sort of half-hug. \"Be careful, succubus. You\u0027ve got a mess o\u0027 dangerous things in your life right now. On all fronts. I don\u0027t want to see you get hurt either.\" I stayed in the embrace and rested my head on his chest. \"When did you get so nice? Are you still trying to get me into bed?\" \"I\u0027m always trying to get you into bed.\" He pressed a kiss to my forehead, to my nose, and then to my lips. \"But I kind of like you too. Just watch out.\" I drove home after that, a bit confused over Dante\u0027s surprising behavior. Thinking about him, I soon arrived in Queen Anne before I knew it. I found neither Vincent nor the angels in my apartment and decided to go to the bookstore. I had today off too, but I knew they were busy and could use the extra help. I needed the distraction. Just before closing, Seth called my cell and asked if I could pick him up at his brother\u0027s. He and Terry had indeed gone to see the movie, but Seth\u0027s car was actually here in Queen Anne and he needed a ride now since Terry had originally picked him up. I finished what I was working on in my office and headed out. Terry and Andrea greeted me warmly when I showed up, reminding me to come to Christmas dinner - even though I\u0027d long since told them I\u0027d be there. They always regarded my relationship with Seth as a tenuous, fragile thing (which it was) and felt compelled to do all they could to protect it. The girls were as thrilled as always to see me, and they assaulted me with questions and chatter. All except Kayla. She\u0027d apparently gotten to stay up late tonight. In some ways, her silence wasn\u0027t surprising. Aside from the startling conversation the other night, she almost never spoke anyway. But usually, she\u0027d come forward with the other girls to see me. Tonight, she simply stayed on the couch, watching me solemnly. When Seth made motions to leave, I broke from the girls and went over to Kayla. \"Hey, you,\" I said, sitting down beside her. \"How\u0027s it - \" I hadn\u0027t touched her, but Kayla suddenly jerked away from me as though she\u0027d been burned. Backing up, she scrambled off the couch and tore out of the room. We heard her small footsteps on the stairs as she ran to her room. Startled, I looked at the others. \"What did I do?\" \"No idea,\" said Andrea, puzzled. \"She\u0027s been fine all night.\" \"Something must have gotten into her,\" said Terry. \"No telling with kids. Especially with girls.\" He mussed Kendall\u0027s hair, and she yelped. Everyone promptly forgot about Kayla and continued to make farewells to Seth and me. I spoke to them half-heartedly, though. Kayla was always happy to see me, and last time, she\u0027d demonstrated a special trust and belief in me. Tonight, she had looked at me with abject terror. Why? Was it a little girl mood? Or was there something hanging on me from another plane that I couldn\u0027t see? Just before we left, I asked if I could go say good-bye to Kayla and give talking to her another shot. Upstairs, I found her curled into a corner of her bed, clutching the unicorn. Her eyes widened in terror when she saw me, and I stopped in the bedroom door. \"Hey,\" I said. \"You okay?\" No answer, just wider eyes. \"I won\u0027t come any closer,\" I said. \"Promise. But, please...just tell me. What do you see? Why are you afraid of me?\" For a moment, I didn\u0027t think she\u0027d answer. Then, finally, she spoke in a voice I could barely hear. \"You\u0027re bad,\" she whispered. \"Why are you so bad?\" That wasn\u0027t what I\u0027d been expecting. I\u0027d thought maybe she\u0027d tell me there was a ghostly hag hovering above my head. Something in Kayla\u0027s words made my stomach sink. I knew I was evil - it was kind of the definition of a Hellish servant. I lived day to day with my eternal task, seducing and corrupting men. But somehow, a little girl telling me I was \"bad\" hit me harder than the cruelest, most profane accusation could. Without another word to her, I headed back downstairs. As I drove Seth back to my place, I gave him the scoop on the angels and my subsequent lack of progress. \"You\u0027ve got some creature stalking you, and you decided to go into work?\" He sounded both amused and exasperated. \"You might as well have gone to the movie with me.\" \"Oh.\" I felt kind of stupid. \"I didn\u0027t want to interrupt any brotherly bonding.\" \"And,\" he added, \"you forgot.\" \"I never forget about you,\" I said stoutly. \"But I was kind of distracted.\" \"Funny how that\u0027s never a good excuse when the roles are reversed...\" My apartment was still empty when we got there. I left my coat and Dante\u0027s charm in my bedroom and then went to sit on the couch with Seth. \"I hate waiting,\" I told him. \"Why does this always happen? Some big, supernatural crisis pops up in my life, and I always end up sitting around and feeling useless. I\u0027m always dependent on others.\" \"No, you aren\u0027t,\" he said, lacing his fingers through mine. \"You\u0027re wonderful and capable. But you can\u0027t do everything.\" \"I just wish I could do something else besides shape-shift and look good. I wish I could, I don\u0027t know, shoot laser beams out of my fingers or something.\" \"You think that\u0027d stop Nyx?\" \"No. But it\u0027d be cool.\" \"Me, I always wanted frost power.\" \"Frost power?\" \"Yeah.\" Seth gestured dramatically toward my coffee table. \"If we\u0027re talking superhero abilities. If I had frost power, I could wave my hand, and suddenly that whole thing would be covered in ice.\" \"Not frost?\" \"Same difference.\" \"How would frost and/or ice power help you fight crime?\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know that it would. But it\u0027d be cool.\" I laughed and snuggled into Seth, feeling better. I could wait this out. \"Are you hungry?\" I asked him. \"Yasmine and Vincent have been waging their own version of Top Chef around here.\" We went to the kitchen and found it stocked with more food than it had ever had since I moved in. I unwrapped a plate of what appeared to be slices of freshly baked shortcake. Seth pointed to the refrigerator. \"If there are strawberries in there, it\u0027s proof of God\u0027s existence.\" I opened the door and peered around. \"Get ready for a religious experience,\" I told him, pulling out a bowl of chopped-and-sugared strawberries. With the other hand, I pulled out a larger bowl covered in plastic wrap. \"And homemade whipped cream.\" \"Hallelujah,\" he said. We piled plates high with shortcake and strawberries, and suddenly, dream entities seemed downright comical. I unwrapped the whipped cream, and Seth promptly dabbed a finger in it. \"Savage,\" I scolded. \"Heavenly,\" he countered, licking off the cream. He stuck another finger into the bowl and held it out to me. I leaned forward and ran my tongue over the tip. Rich sweetness flooded my mouth. \"Mmm,\" I said, closing my eyes. \"Mmm,\" said Seth. I opened my eyes. \"Are you talking about the whipped cream?\" \"Not exactly.\" \"You talking about this?\" There was still whipped cream on his finger. I took it into my mouth and sucked gently on it, cleaning up the last of the cream and stroking Seth\u0027s skin with my tongue. When I finished, he exhaled a held breath. \"Thanks for the cleanup.\" \"Cleanliness is next to godliness, I hear.\" \"I think I have more on me, though,\" he said. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Where?\" He swiped his finger through more whipped cream. \"Right here.\" I licked that off too, sucking and kissing all of the fingers on his hand - not just the guilty one. Finished, I flipped the hand over and kissed the top of it. \"There. Sparkling clean.\" Seth shook his head. \"Oh no.\" \"What?\" \"You\u0027ve got some on you too.\" \"Do I? Where?\" He dipped into more whipped cream and dabbed it on my lips, my chin, and the side of my throat. \"Everywhere,\" he said. Before I could formulate a response, his mouth was on my neck, licking and kissing with as much sensuality as I had just used on his fingers. The eroticism of it astounded me - and I was hardly one to be caught by surprise with such things. I instinctually moved my body toward his, arching my neck back as his lips continued moving up. I felt his tongue, warm and amazingly skilled, clean up every drop of the whipped cream on my throat before sliding to my chin and finally to my mouth. We kissed harder, dessert (of the food nature) now forgotten. I felt his lips fit perfectly with my own. My back was against the counter, and Seth pressed his body against mine, trapping me. When I finally pulled back from the kiss, I could scarcely breathe. \"Wow,\" I said, eyes wide. \"This is why I don\u0027t cook. It only leads to trouble.\" Seth, still right against me, glanced left and then right. There was a heated, feral look in his eyes that made me shiver. \"I don\u0027t see anything too bad happening.\" \"Not yet,\" I admitted. \"But you know the drill.\" He shrugged. \"Yeah. But nothing bad is happening now.\" \"It will if we - mmphf!\" Seth was kissing me again, and this time his arms went around my waist, pulling us closer still. I wrapped my own arms around his neck, tilting my face upward to get more of the kiss. It was hot and dangerous and amazing, and I couldn\u0027t get enough. I knew, though, that I\u0027d have to get enough of it pretty quickly here and was contemplating how to stop it when Seth broke away first. \"Ah,\" I teased. \"You\u0027ve come to your senses.\" Seth smiled at me, and my heart raced at the juxtaposition of the animal desire and trademark laidback look on his face. \"Nope,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s see how far we can go.\" \"You already know,\" I said. \"We\u0027ve timed this before.\" That was a bit of an exaggeration. We\u0027d never had a stopwatch or anything, but we\u0027d gained a good sense of how long and how deep a kiss could go before it was time to part. He shook his head. \"Not kissing. This.\" I wore a black tank top with a red cardigan over it. Seth reached out and unfastened the sweater\u0027s three large buttons and pulled it off of me. Letting it drop to the floor, he then rested his hands on my arms, fingers warm against my bare skin. He looked at me expectantly. \"We\u0027re timing how quickly you can take off my sweater?\" I asked. \"Wrong answer. It\u0027s not always about you.\" Removing his hands, he caught the bottom edge of his Cap\u0027n Crunch T-shirt and pulled it over his head. He\u0027d pulled me to his chest before it even hit the floor, and suddenly, I was face to face with golden, delicious-smelling Seth skin. Lots of it. Resisting the urge to start kissing his chest then and there, I looked up into his face and attempted levity. \"Is this like strip poker? Except...without the poker part?\" \"This, Thetis,\" he said, grabbing the edge of my tank top, \"is a test. A test to see how far we can go on all dimensions. Not just kissing.\" I should have stopped him, but the feel of his hands sliding up my torso was too intoxicating. The tank top went over my head and joined the other clothing on my kitchen floor. I laughed. \"So...we know how much kissing we can do. Now you\u0027re trying to see how much naked we can do?\" \"Yes,\" he said. He was attempting a dignified air. \"It\u0027s a scientific experiment.\" \"Mostly it seems like you pulling off my clothes.\" \"That\u0027s part of it. We know how much we can kiss. But can we kiss naked? How long can we kiss naked? Is it the same?\" \"I don - \" Again, he cut me off with a kiss, and my whole body tingled as my breasts pressed up against his chest. There was nothing between us, just skin on skin, and it was incredible. Between that and the kiss, I felt dizzy. And so, Seth\u0027s experiment progressed. He removed articles of our clothing one at a time, then would kiss me, pause, and examine the results. When we were both completely naked, he stepped back and admired my body, his face gleeful and smug. \"I don\u0027t think the succubus thing is working,\" he said. \"Oh, it works, believe me,\" I said, suddenly nervous. Every inch of me wanted to be touched and caressed and ravaged. My skin burned. And the hunger within me - the instinct that urged me to feed off human energy - was raging, realizing just how close it was to dinnertime. This had started out as an amusing game, but it now occurred to me how dangerous this had become. \"It\u0027s less about naked and more about us not kissing so much. Remember that time we started making out in bed? I got some of your energy then, and we were dressed. Push this enough - or start doing things with other parts of our bodies - and it\u0027ll be game over.\" I stepped back and reached for my shirt. \"But you made good scientific progress tonight, I\u0027ll give you that.\" Seth caught my wrist before I could get the shirt. He pulled me back to him. \"Just a little bit more. Just to see.\" He still had the same intensity and arousal all over him. I\u0027d seen it in him before but never like this. \"What more is there?\" I asked. \"Just one more kiss,\" he said, feigning innocence. \"A...parting kiss.\" \"Oh good grief.\" \"One kiss, Thetis. That\u0027s it.\" I hesitated, then nodded. \"Okay. Fine. But I\u0027m onto you, so don\u0027t think you can get away with anything here.\" \"Noted.\" At least that\u0027s what I think he said because it came out kind of muffled with his mouth crushing mine. I was pressed back against the counter again, and his hand was moving down my ass, down the back of my thigh. We were so close. So, so close. We\u0027d never been this close, this naked, before. We\u0027d certainly never been this naked and kissing before. I felt alive and on fire, craving him both as a succubus and a woman in love. The floodgates burst, and all the passion we kept restrained flowed forth. I could feel him, how hard he was and how much he wanted me. My own body responded in kind, pushing closer and grinding against him. His hand on the back of my thigh tensed and then pulled my leg up. It was barely around his hip when I felt...it. It. Seth\u0027s life. Sweeter than kissing, sweeter than whipped cream. It came into me pure and bright, unlike anything else I\u0027d ever tasted - well, other than the last time I\u0027d stolen some from him. I would have moaned if my mouth wasn\u0027t preoccupied. Reason seized me, and I did my best to squirm free. My best wasn\u0027t good enough, and all I could do was slide my mouth away from his. He simply moved down, kissing my neck. The energy didn\u0027t stop. \"Seth. Seth. We made the point. We saw how far we can go.\" His eyes, full of so much longing and passion, held mine. \"Please, Georgina...we\u0027re so close...just this once...\" We were so close. Too close. \"No.\" I pressed my palms to his chest. \"Seth! Stop.\" I shoved hard. \"Stop!\" I broke free all at once and staggered a few feet back, my hand catching the counter for support. The energy transfer cut off abruptly. He reached out a hand to help steady me, but I stayed out of reach. \"Are...are you okay?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m fine,\" I said, breath heavy. \"But you aren\u0027t. I got a little - a little of your energy.\" \"A little is nothing.\" \"Not to me,\" I said, still keeping my distance. \"It\u0027s not your energy,\" he said. His eyes were still heated and hungry. \"It\u0027s mine. And I think it was worth it.\" He took a step forward. \"And I\u0027d think it was worth it, even if I lost more.\" I held out my hand, palm-first. \"Stop. Don\u0027t come closer. I don\u0027t trust you.\" His expression became less aroused and more dumbfounded. \"You...don\u0027t trust me? I never thought I\u0027d hear you say that.\" \"That\u0027s not what I meant. Exactly. I mean, I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to rape me or anything, but you\u0027re...uh, persuasive. And you haven\u0027t been yourself lately. Ever since you got shot. You\u0027ve been...I don\u0027t know. Risky. Like you\u0027re having a mid-life crisis.\" \"I\u0027m having a life crisis, Thetis. I don\u0027t want to be one of those people who discovers on my death bed that I didn\u0027t do anything. Why can\u0027t you understand this? You\u0027re so quick to encourage Maddie to do exciting things, but you\u0027re still trying to protect me.\" \"It...it\u0027s different.\" \"How?\" he asked. \"Why is it okay for her to take risks but not me?\" \"Because there\u0027s a big difference between going rock climbing and sleeping with someone who\u0027s going to take years off your life. How long is this phase going to last? You always said it wasn\u0027t about sex between us.\" \"It\u0027s not,\" he said stoutly. \"Not at all. I love you for...so many reasons. More than I can even begin to describe. But I don\u0027t want to die never having touched you. Really touched you.\" I stared. He was serious. How could he say he didn\u0027t want to die without touching me when touching me would only lead him closer to death? \"You\u0027re only saying this because you haven\u0027t had sex in so long,\" I accused. \"You got all turned on and now you\u0027re not thinking straight.\" \"I am turned on,\" he agreed. \"By you. The woman I love.\" He took another step toward me but still stayed far enough away so we didn\u0027t touch. \"I want you, Georgina. So badly it kills me. I know you want me too. How can we go on being afraid of something we never tried? I\u0027ll take a hit for it, yeah, but if we go on for years...without ever knowing...\" He shook his head and sighed. \"Please, Georgina. Just this once. Let us be together - really together.\" I swallowed. He was so earnest. So sweet. So sexy. And so help me, he sounded reasonable. The calm way he spoke almost made me believe it didn\u0027t matter, that if I gave in and let our bodies come together, the loss would be small and inconsequential. I looked into his eyes and tried to convince myself of his rationalization, bringing up what Carter and others had said. That it was Seth\u0027s choice to make, nothing for me to worry about. But, of course, it was. \"No,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t. Please, Seth. Don\u0027t do this. Don\u0027t look at me like that. I love you too - so, so much. But we can\u0027t do this. I\u0027m telling you, you just need to have sex. Go out and find someone - anyone. It doesn\u0027t matter. I don\u0027t care. It\u0027ll fix all this and make it easier for us to go on.\" \"You would care,\" he said, voice deadly calm. \"You say you wouldn\u0027t, but you would.\" \"Not if it protects you.\" \"Protecting me doesn\u0027t matter.\" \"Damn it, it does!\" I yelled, lunging forward. I drove my fists - lightly - into his chest, and all the emotion that had been building up throughout this argument suddenly burst out. \"Don\u0027t you get it? I have to protect you! If anything happens to you - if I\u0027m responsible for anything happening to you - it will kill me. It. Will. Kill. Me. I can\u0027t handle that. I can\u0027t handle anything happening to you. It will kill me!\" I stopped my yelling and met Seth\u0027s eyes. Neither of us said anything. And as he stared down at me, I knew what he was thinking. Because I was thinking exactly the same thing. I had just given voice to what Hugh had said, what Seth had been worried about. In my outburst, I\u0027d changed the balance of risk. It wasn\u0027t about Seth hurting. It was about me hurting. Gently, he reached out and caught my wrists. He removed them from his chest and let go. Backing up, still not speaking, he picked up his clothes and began dressing. I stayed where I was, naked and frozen. \"Seth...\" I said slowly. \"I didn\u0027t mean it.\" \"It\u0027s okay, Thetis,\" he said, fastening his pants and not meeting my eyes. \"I understand. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry I pushed you.\" \"No, no...it\u0027s not...\" \"It\u0027s okay,\" he repeated. His voice was so, so neutral. So, so steady. It wasn\u0027t natural. \"Really. But I think I need to go. I think it\u0027s better for both of us, and God only knows you have enough going on without me to worry about.\" I felt tears starting to fill my eyes. \"I didn\u0027t mean...\" \"I know what you meant,\" he said. He straightened his shirt and finally looked at me. \"But seriously...I should leave. We\u0027ll talk...I don\u0027t know. We\u0027ll talk later.\" He held out his hand, like he might touch my cheek, and then let it drop. With another sigh, he said good-bye and left. I stood exactly where I was, still not moving. My heart felt like it had just had acid thrown on it. It was burning and raw. Finally, finally, it all caught up with me. My knees gave out, and I sank to the floor. It was cold and hard against my bare skin. I drew my knees up to me and buried my face in them, wondering what I had done. Part of me screamed to go follow him, to beg him to come back, to tell him we could make love and have everything we had ever wanted. Another part, half-reason and half-pride, held me back. It was that same part that had stopped me from going after Andrew that day back in the garden after we\u0027d fought about the Black Death. I\u0027d let him go and gone out of my way to avoid him after that. When the plague finally came to our town, my bishop was one of the first to leave. I went with him and the rest of our household. Just like in The Masque of the Red Death, there was no true place to hide from sickness. Still, some places were better than others, and my bishop took care to keep to the better places. He survived. Months went by, and stories and rumors trickled in about the town we\u0027d lived in. By that point, I\u0027d grown weary of Geoffrey and decided it was time for me to move on. I got permission from my archdemon for a transfer to Florence and sneaked out of Geoffrey\u0027s house one night to make the long journey. Our old town was along the way, and a week later, I passed through it. A plague town wasn\u0027t quite like what modern people might imagine. It wasn\u0027t as though there were piles of bodies lying in the streets or anything. Not always. After all, Europe had survived the Black Death in the end, and civilization had still functioned through the worst of it. Crops were still grown, houses still built, babies still born. But the town seemed quieter and more melancholy than when I\u0027d lived there. Andrew wasn\u0027t at the church when I stopped by, and an old man tending the grounds told me that Andrew was off helping some of his parishioners in one of the poorer districts. I found him there, inside the home of a brewer. The brewer had a large family - eight children - as well as a couple of brothers living with him. The house was small and cramped and filthy. Everyone in it was sick except for the brewer\u0027s wife who wearily tried to help Andrew take care of her family. \"Cecily?\" he asked in astonishment when he saw me. He was kneeling by a teenage boy. Something inside my chest blossomed with both joy and relief. Andrew was alive. He\u0027d stayed, fought disease, and won. I strode forward and knelt beside him. The wife, giving water to a small girl, watched me uneasily. I wasn\u0027t in silk or anything, but I was clearly from a different class than theirs, and she didn\u0027t entirely know how to treat me. \"You\u0027re alive,\" I breathed. \"I\u0027ve been so worried. So worried I\u0027d never see you again.\" He smiled that gentle smile of his, and I saw more lines around his eyes than I\u0027d seen before. \"God didn\u0027t want to separate us quite yet,\" he said. I looked down at the boy. I\u0027d figured Andrew was feeding him or something, but I realized then that the priest was actually giving him last rites. The boy wore no shirt, and I could see on his neck and in his armpits the tell-tale dark pustules that had given the plague its name. The plague usually did what it was going to do in about a week, but from his emaciated look, you would have thought he\u0027d been dying for years. His eyes were fever-bright, and I didn\u0027t know if he even knew we were there. Bile rose in my throat, and I averted my eyes. Standing up, I told Andrew, \"I\u0027ll let...I\u0027ll let you finish this and wait outside.\" I left the house, going out to where it was warm and things weren\u0027t dying. A while later, Andrew found me. I didn\u0027t ask if the boy was still alive. Instead, I said, \"How many of them live? Out of all the ones you stay and risk your life for, how many of them actually survive?\" He shrugged. \"Three-quarters. Sometimes half, if they\u0027re very young or very old.\" \"Half,\" I repeated flatly. \"That\u0027s not very good.\" \"If one more person lives because of me, then that\u0027s very good.\" I looked at that confident, serene face and sighed. \"You\u0027re so damned frustrating.\" He smiled. I sighed again. \"What can I do to help?\" The smile disappeared. \"Don\u0027t make light of this, Cecily.\" \"I\u0027m not. Tell me what to do.\" And that was how I found myself playing nurse in a small town in backwoods England. Honestly, there wasn\u0027t anything glamorous one could do to fight the plague. It was all about basics, keeping the people clean and supplied with as much food and water as they could take in. The rest was in the hands of their immune system and - if you believed Andrew - God. When my patients began declining past the point of no return, I usually stopped helping. I couldn\u0027t stand to watch and left them to Andrew and his prayers. But sometimes I\u0027d see people come back around, people whom I\u0027d given up on, and then I could almost believe there was a higher power at work. At least, I believed that until Andrew got sick. It started slowly at first, a fever and aches, but we both knew what that meant. He ignored it and kept working until the symptoms began compounding. Finally, he couldn\u0027t fight it. Neglecting my other patients, I devoted myself fully to him. \"You should help others,\" he told me one day. His skin was pink and blotchy, and he was starting to get the dark spots around his lymph glands. Through all the sickness and fatigue, he was still beautiful to me. \"Don\u0027t worry about me.\" \"I have to worry about you. No one else is.\" It was true. Andrew had helped so many, but no one had come to his side, despite the fact that plague survivors tended not to catch it again. \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Andrew told me, voice frail. \"I\u0027m glad they\u0027ve survived.\" \"You will too,\" I said obstinately, even though the signs were starting to suggest otherwise. \"You have to go on so you can keep doing your annoying good works.\" He managed a smile. \"I hope so, but I think my time in this world may be drawing to a close. You, though...\" He looked at me - truly looked at me - and I was astonished at the love I saw there. I knew he\u0027d been attracted to me, but I\u0027d never expected this. \"You, Cecily...you won\u0027t get sick. You will go on, strong and healthy and beautiful. I can feel it. God loves you.\" \"No,\" I said sadly. \"God hates me. That\u0027s why he lets me keep living.\" \"God only gives us tasks he knows we can handle. Here, take this.\" He touched the gold cross around his neck, but he was too weak to take it off. \"Take it when I\u0027m gone.\" \"No, Andrew, you won\u0027t - \" \"Take it,\" he repeated in as firm a voice as he could manage. \"Take it, and whenever you see it, remember that God loves you and knows that no tragedy you face is ever too much for you to bear. You are strong. You will endure.\" Hot tears spilled down my cheeks. \"You shouldn\u0027t have done this,\" I told him. \"You shouldn\u0027t have helped them. You would\u0027ve lived if you hadn\u0027t.\" He shook his head. \"Yes, but then I wouldn\u0027t have been able to live with myself.\" Andrew lingered a few more days after that. I stayed with him, but every moment of it was agony. I hated watching what happened to him and was more convinced than ever that there really was no benevolent power looking after humans. He died peacefully and quietly, much as he\u0027d lived. Another priest came to administer last rites when it happened, and Andrew\u0027s final conscious moments reflected hope and absolute faith in what would come next. I stayed to make sure the funeral arrangements were taken care of, not that there was much fanfare or anything. There were no viewings or fancy funeral halls in those days - at least not for men like him. I soon left England for the continent, and after a while, the pain of his death began to take on a new form. Oh, I still missed him - still burned and ached and felt like part of me had been ripped away. But added to that, guilt was starting to create a pain of its own. I felt like I should have taken better care of him. I should have insisted on him leaving with me when the plague came. Or maybe I should have gotten my hands dirtier while helping him tend the sick; it might have kept him away from whomever had infected him. Florence was a beautiful city, on the verge of the Renaissance when I got there. Yet even while living amongst all that splendor and art, Andrew\u0027s death tormented me for many years, the pain of guilt and missing him digging into my heart. It never entirely went away, but it did lessen - it just took a really, really long time. As Hugh had said, a long life simply means having more time to mourn.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-20.html","bookId":2056,"book":{"id":2056,"title":"Succubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid #3)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 3: Succubus Dreams especially when the girl in question is Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men.
