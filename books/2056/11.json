It played out the same as always, starting with the dishes, going all the way up to when my dream-self looked into the living room to smile at the little girl. After a few more moments, my dream-self returned to her dishes. Silently, I screamed at her to look back. I couldn\u0027t get enough of the girl. I wanted to drink her in. I could have watched her forever, taking in those long-lashed eyes and wispy curls. Then, as though she could hear me, my dream-self glanced back into the other room. The girl was gone. My dream-self jerked her hands out of the water, just in time to hear a thump and a crash. The sound of crying followed, and then I woke up. It was late morning, and my energy was gone. That honestly didn\u0027t surprise me anymore. Coupled with that loss, however, was a new sensation. I felt cold, chilled to the bone. My skin also felt wet, like I\u0027d been submerged in water. When I ran my fingers over my arm, it was perfectly dry. Nonetheless, I put on the heaviest sweater I could find, and eventually the chill abated. Work was busy and not particularly eventful until the end, when Maddie casually reminded me about us hanging out afterward. I nearly walked into a display when she said that. In my haste yesterday, I\u0027d gone ahead and made plans with both Maddie and Seth for after work. I had a tendency to do that kind of thing when I was stressed. I felt so popular. And, as I often did in this kind of situation, I solved it by combining both of my mistakes into one solution. \"Maddie wanted to hang out tonight,\" I told Seth. \"I think she\u0027s lonely. Mind if I bring her in for the babysitting thing?\" \"Sure,\" he said, not looking up from his laptop. \"Seth wanted help babysitting tonight,\" I told Maddie. \"Do you mind if we sort of make that our evening activity?\" Maddie gave the proposition a bit more thought than Seth had. She didn\u0027t look upset so much as puzzled. \"I haven\u0027t really been around many kids. It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t like them...just that it\u0027s always kind of weird.\" \"His nieces are great,\" I assured her. \"You\u0027ll be a convert.\" I felt a little bad about strong-arming her into the Mortensen family adventure. She stayed silent for most of the ride up, keeping her thoughts to herself. Seth\u0027s family lived up north of the city, in Lake Forest Park. Their house looked exactly like the other ones on the street, but I suspected it was a necessary sacrifice in order to accommodate two adults and five girls. \"Oh my God,\" said Maddie when we stepped inside the house. All five Mortensen daughters were there. They ranged in age from four to fourteen, all sharing their mother\u0027s blond hair and blue eyes. We seemed to have walked into the middle of an argument. \"Maybe...this wasn\u0027t such a good idea...\" I looked around the room. Seth had gotten there earlier, and Terry and Andrea had already left to do their shopping. Fourteen-year-old Brandy tried to make her voice heard over that of Kendall, who was nine and the twins McKenna and Morgan who were six. Only four-year-old Kayla, sitting on the couch beside her uncle, listened quietly. I couldn\u0027t even tell what the others were fighting about. \"It can spin webs!\" cried Kendall. \"No, it can\u0027t. That\u0027s just its name.\" Brandy looked weary. The others weren\u0027t paying attention to her. \"The horn would slice the webs!\" cried McKenna. Morgan backed her by making a chopping motion with her hand. \"Not if the monkey trapped it first,\" retorted Kendall. \"The unicorn can run fast. The monkey couldn\u0027t catch it.\" \"Then it\u0027s a coward!\" Kendall looked triumphant. \"It loses automatically if it doesn\u0027t show up for the fight.\" Both twins appeared stumped by this bit of logic. \"This is a stupid argument,\" said Brandy. \"Unicorns aren\u0027t real.\" The other three girls turned on her and started shouting their protests. \"HEY!\" I yelled over the cacophony. Everyone fell silent and looked at me. I don\u0027t think the girls had noticed my arrival. \"What\u0027s going on?\" \"A debate over who would win if a unicorn got in a fight with a spider monkey,\" said Seth. Beside me, Maddie made a strange noise that sounded suspiciously like a squelched laugh. \"It\u0027s been compelling and well thought out,\" added Seth, his voice deadpan. Brandy groaned. \"Unicorns aren\u0027t real.\" \"Spider monkeys aren\u0027t real!\" McKenna shot back. \"Yes, they are,\" said Brandy. \"This is all pointless.\" Kendall glared at her. \"It\u0027s hypocritical.\" \"Hypothetical,\" I corrected. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Seth told Maddie and me. \"It\u0027s downright civil compared to the mermaid-centaur debate.\" \"Guys,\" I said. \"This is Maddie.\" I ticked off the girls\u0027 names for her, one by one. \"Hi,\" said Maddie nervously. She eyed each girl, then looked at Seth uncertainly. She\u0027d been acting differently around him since the auction, and I made a mental note to harass him about their date. \"This might have been a bad idea...\" He smiled one of those sweet smiles that could make anyone feel better. She smiled back, relaxing a little. \"Nope. We need all the help we can get around here.\" He rose, scooping up Kayla as he rose. \"What I actually need is a distraction while everyone under age nine gets put to bed.\" The twins cried out in dismay. I glanced at Brandy and Kendall. \"Sounds easy enough.\" \"Don\u0027t speak so soon,\" warned Brandy. Kendall was already in motion. She tore out of the room and returned with a long cardboard box that she nearly shoved into my face. \"Look what Grandma sent me.\" It was a Monopoly game. \"The Industrial Revolution edition?\" I asked dumbfounded. \"It\u0027s about the only edition they hadn\u0027t made yet,\" remarked Seth. \"I think they\u0027re kind of grasping at straws.\" \"You got that for Christmas?\" I asked. \"You wanted it for Christmas?\" \"I want to be a real estate mongrel when I grow up,\" she explained. \"Mogul,\" I corrected. \"And I thought you wanted to be a pirate?\" She gave me a pitying look. \"They don\u0027t have very good health insurance.\" I pointed to the box. \"But why the Industrial Revolution? Wouldn\u0027t you have rather had, I don\u0027t know, the Barbie edition? Or the Sephora edition?\" I kind of wanted that last one for myself. \"The Industrial Revolution was an important period in Western Civilization. The developments in production and manufacturing forever changed the face of our culture and socioeconomic status.\" She paused. \"You wanna play?\" \"Is one of the pieces a spinning jenny?\" asked Maddie. Seth laughed. \"Actually, it is.\" \"I\u0027m in,\" she said. Kayla, who was in Seth\u0027s arms, appeared on the verge of falling asleep then and there. Her cuddly form reminded me of the dream girl, and my heart lurched. Suddenly, Monopoly held little appeal. I walked over to Seth. \"Tell you what. You play, and I\u0027ll take bedtime duty.\" \"You sure?\" \"Positive.\" He passed her off, and she wrapped her little arms around my neck. With the twins in tow, I left the others to set up the game. Maddie looked distinctly uncomfortable at being abandoned, but I knew she\u0027d do fine. Sometimes being forced to socialize was the best way to learn. The twins were surprisingly easy to put to bed, probably because they slept in the same room. Going to bed wasn\u0027t such a big deal when you had a sister to whisper to and giggle with. I supervised the brushing of teeth and putting on of pajamas, then closed them in with warnings that I\u0027d check back. Still balancing Kayla on one hip, I carried her to the room she shared with Kendall. Kayla almost never said anything, so I wasn\u0027t particularly surprised when she didn\u0027t protest having a pink nightgown pulled over her head and being tucked under the covers. I sat on the edge of her bed and handed her a stuffed unicorn I\u0027d found on the floor. She wrapped it in her arms. \"I think it could take the spider monkey,\" I told her. Kayla said nothing but just watched me with those huge blue eyes. They were filled with such trust and sweetness - just like my daughter in the dream. How amazing would it be to do this every night? To tuck someone in and kiss her forehead, then wake up with her each morning? Suddenly, fearing I might cry in front of a four-year-old, I started to rise. To my complete astonishment, she held out her hand and touched my arm. \"Georgina.\" Her voice was small and soprano and sweet. I sat back down. \"Hmm?\" \"Don\u0027t leave,\" she said. \"Oh, honey. I have to. You need to sleep.\" \"Monsters will come.\" \"What monsters?\" \"The bad ones.\" \"Ah. I see. Are they under your bed?\" I was pretty sure that\u0027s where most monsters lived. Aside from the ones I played poker with and bought Secret Santa presents for. She shook her head and pointed up at the ceiling. \"They live there. In space.\" \"Are they aliens?\" As much as I hated the thought of her being afraid to go to bed, I was rather enchanted to be having a conversation with her for the first time ever. She was as articulate as all the other girls - not that I should have been surprised by that. \"No. They\u0027re monsters. They swoop in the air and go in people\u0027s dreams.\" I caught on to her reluctance to sleep now. \"Have you been having nightmares?\" \"No. But the monsters are there. I feel them.\" Something about her words and the serious set of her face sent a chill down my spine. \"You want me to stay until you fall asleep? Will that keep them away?\" \"Maybe,\" she said. She touched my arm again. \"You\u0027re magic.\" I wondered then if Kayla might be a psychic in the making, like Erik or Dante. The way she spoke implied more than a childhood belief in magic. There was almost an authority there. She\u0027d be worth keeping an eye on, but I wouldn\u0027t pursue anything now. I certainly wasn\u0027t going to start quizzing her about auras. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll stay.\" I lay down beside her, and she studied me in silence. I began humming an old song, which made her smile and close her eyes. When I finished, she opened her eyes again. \"What are the words?\" \"Eh...\" That was hard to answer. It was a song from my mortal life, one that had been composed in an ancient Cyprian dialect no one spoke anymore. My husband used to sing it to me. Knowing I couldn\u0027t reproduce the rhymes or any sort of good translation on the spot, I simply sang it to her in the original language. The syllables, familiar yet strange, came awkwardly to my lips. When I finished, Kayla didn\u0027t say anything or move. I waited a couple more minutes and slowly got out of the bed. She continued sleeping. Turning off the light, I left the room and returned to the Monopoly players. Seth smiled at my approach and made room for me beside him on the floor. \"Luddites burn your mill. Pay five-hundred dollars.\" Brandy grimaced at her Chance card. \"Weak.\" \"That\u0027s not as much as I had to pay when the Factory Acts cut my child labor force a couple turns ago,\" Maddie pointed out. As I\u0027d hoped, she seemed perfectly at ease now. Kendall rolled the dice and moved her miniature pewter Oliver Twist book ahead three spaces. \"I wish I had a job, so I could save capitalism for my investments.\" \"Capital,\" the rest of us said in unison. Kendall glanced up at me. \"I could work at your bookstore. Under the table.\" \"Like stacking books under the table?\" asked Brandy. Kendall ignored her. \"Don\u0027t you need extra help?\" I ruffled her hair. \"Not until you\u0027re of age, I\u0027m afraid.\" Maddie moved her pewter spinning jenny. \"Yeah, haven\u0027t you learned anything from this game? You\u0027d get us shut down. Georgina doesn\u0027t need that kind of paperwork.\" \"How\u0027s your manager job?\" asked Brandy. \"Is it harder?\" \"Mostly it\u0027s...different.\" Kendall brightened. \"I could have your old job.\" \"Sorry. No vacancy. Maddie took my place.\" Kendall sighed. Seth landed on a silk mill no one had purchased yet and began rustling up money. \"The girls go to bed okay?\" \"Yeah...Kayla had a hard time, though. She was worried about nightmares.\" He looked up in surprise. \"She told you that? She, like, spoke?\" \"Yeah, we had a whole discourse. Laughed, cried, shared our hopes and fears. I think she has an oratorical career ahead of her.\" \"What\u0027s \u0027oratorical\u0027 mean?\" asked Kendall. \"It refers to speaking in public,\" Maddie explained. \"Giving speeches. Talking in front of others.\" \"Oh. Uncle Seth doesn\u0027t have an oratorical career.\" We all laughed. \"No,\" agreed Maddie. \"He doesn\u0027t. I certainly don\u0027t either.\" Seth high-fived her. \"Introverts unite.\" Brandy picked up another Chance card and groaned. \"Cholera outbreak! Not again!\" When the night finally ended and Seth\u0027s brother and sister-in-law came home, I was happy to learn that Maddie had had a really good time. \"Kids aren\u0027t so bad as long as they\u0027re brainiac Mortensen offspring. Terry and Andrea were nice too. Good genes in that group.\" \"Yup,\" I agreed. Maddie definitely needed more socialization, I decided. She was cheerful and upbeat, her eyes sparkling and excited. This had been a good night. I dropped her off at Doug\u0027s and drove back to my apartment. The parking gods weren\u0027t with me tonight, and I ended up about five blocks away. As I walked, I passed a newspaper dispenser for the Seattle Times. I usually read the headlines at the store but hadn\u0027t today. I paused in front of it, one article catching my eye. It was a weird story about a local man who\u0027d turned delusional. He\u0027d had a dream that if he swam across Puget Sound, it would bring wealth and security to his struggling family. Sadly, he hadn\u0027t made it very far before drowning in the freezing waters. The ironic part was that although some might consider the feat suicidal, his massive life insurance policy was going to pay out. His family would get their wealth and security after all. Staring blankly at the paper, I thought about the poor man succumbing and disappearing under the dark waves. I suddenly flashed back to this morning, and it was like I could feel the cold, wet sensation all over again. For half a second, I couldn\u0027t breathe. It was as though my lungs were filling with water, suffocating me. I shuddered and absentmindedly ran my hands over my arms, the d¨¦j¨¤ vu nearly overpowering me. Water. Water everywhere. Cold. Black. Smothering... I shivered and finally made myself start walking again, needing to find someplace warm.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-11.html","bookId":2056,"book":{"id":2056,"title":"Succubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid #3)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 3: Succubus Dreams especially when the girl in question is Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men.
