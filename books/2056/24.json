During that ride to the airport, however, I got a taste of what eternity might feel like.\\n\\n Maddie spent almost the entire time talking about Seth. In fact, I\u0027m pretty sure the only time she didn\u0027t was when she stopped to check her watch and ponder whether we would make it on time. I knew we would make it on time because I would stop the car and carry her on my back before I\u0027d risk her missing her flight and needing to ride back with me to the city. Once she\u0027d decided we were still okay with time, it was back to Seth. Seth, Seth, Seth.\\n\\n I\u0027m pretty sure there were only about three people in the world I wouldn\u0027t have suspected of fucking with me if they\u0027d come telling a story like this. Unfortunately, Maddie was one of them. She was telling the truth. It was written all over her, and something in me - maybe the part that really understood how serious the fight between Seth and me had been - could feel it.\\n\\n After a while, my mind sort of went numb, and I stopped thinking about it all. I finally dropped her off at the airport and went home, barely aware of the traffic I once again had to fight my way through. When I got back to my apartment, I ate dinner and watched A Christmas Carol. A long, hot bath followed, and five shots of vodka finally put me down for the night. I slept on the couch because I couldn\u0027t bear to go in the room where an angel had fallen. Some Christmas Eve.\\n\\n Seth came over the next morning to take me to dinner at Terry and Andrea\u0027s. Uneasiness radiated around him, but he still smiled when he saw me.\\n\\n \"You look great.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n I knew I did. I\u0027d spent two hours getting ready, the last thirty minutes of which had been me simply standing in front of the mirror. I\u0027d stood there, taking in every detail of my appearance. The clinging red dress. The curve of my neck under the glittering black choker. The way my golden-brown hair, worn sleek and smooth today, hung down my back. Gold eye shadow and black liner framed my eyes. My lips glowed under pale peach lip gloss. Even at five-four, my legs looked long and supple. My face, carved with high cheekbones and flawless skin, was beautiful.\\n\\n I was beautiful.\\n\\n Call it vanity or egotism, but it was true. I was so, so beautiful. More beautiful than Maddie. More beautiful than any mortal woman. Staring at that gorgeous reflection, I begged it to tell me that Seth would want me. He had to want me. How could he not?\\n\\n But I knew all the beauty in the world couldn\u0027t mask the pain in me. And after a couple more moments, Seth noticed too. His smile vanished.\\n\\n \"How did you find out?\" he asked.\\n\\n I dropped the coat I\u0027d been holding. \"How do you think? She told me. She couldn\u0027t wait to tell me.\"\\n\\n He sighed and sat on the arm of my couch and stared into space.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it? You have nothing else to say?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry. God, I\u0027m really sorry. I didn\u0027t mean for you to find out like this.\"\\n\\n \"Were you ever going to tell me?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah...of course.\"\\n\\n His voice was so sweet and so gentle that it momentarily defused the anger that wanted to explode out of me. I stared at him, looking hard into those amber brown eyes. \"She said...she said you didn\u0027t drink, but you did, right? That\u0027s what happened?\" I sounded like I was Kendall\u0027s age and suspected I wore the pleading expression Yasmine had given Jerome.\\n\\n Seth\u0027s face stayed expressionless. \"No, Thetis. I wasn\u0027t drunk. I didn\u0027t drink at all.\"\\n\\n I sank down into the armchair opposite him. \"Then...then...what happened?\"\\n\\n It took a while for him to get the story out. I could see the two warring halves within him: the one that wanted to be open and the one that hated to tell me things I wouldn\u0027t like.\\n\\n \"I was so upset after what happened with us. I was actually on the verge of calling that guy...what\u0027s his name? Niphon. I couldn\u0027t stand it - I wanted to fix things between us. But just before I did, I ran into Maddie. I was so...I don\u0027t know. Just confused. Distraught. She asked me to get food, and before I knew it, I\u0027d accepted.\" He raked a hand through his hair, neutral expression turning confused and frustrated. \"And being with her...she was just so nice. Sweet. Easy to talk to. And after leaving things off physically with you, I\u0027d been kind of...um...\"\\n\\n \"Aroused? Horny? Lust-filled?\"\\n\\n He grimaced. \"Something like that. But, I don\u0027t know. There was more to it than just that.\"\\n\\n The tape in my mind rewound. \"Did you say you were going to call Niphon?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. We\u0027d talked at poker...and then he called me once. Said if I ever wanted...he could make me a deal. I thought it was crazy at the time, but after I left you that night...I don\u0027t know. It just made me wonder if maybe it was worth it to live the life I wanted and make it so you wouldn\u0027t have to worry so much.\"\\n\\n \"Maddie coming along was a blessing then,\" I muttered. Christ. Seth had seriously considered selling his soul. I really needed to deal with Niphon. He hadn\u0027t listened to me when I\u0027d told him to leave Seth alone. I wanted to rip the imp\u0027s throat out, but my revenge would have to wait. I took a deep breath.\\n\\n \"Well,\" I told Seth. \"That\u0027s that. I can\u0027t say I like it...but, well...it\u0027s over.\"\\n\\n He tilted his head curiously. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"This. This Maddie thing. You finally had a fling. We\u0027ve always agreed you could, right? I mean, it\u0027s not fair for me to be the only one who gets some. Now we can move on.\"\\n\\n A long silence fell. Aubrey jumped up beside me and rubbed her head against my arm. I ran a hand over her soft fur while I waited for Seth\u0027s response.\\n\\n \"Georgina,\" he said at last. \"You know...I\u0027ve told you...well. I don\u0027t really have flings.\"\\n\\n My hand froze on Aubrey\u0027s back. \"What are you saying?\"\\n\\n \"I...don\u0027t have flings.\"\\n\\n \"Are you saying you want to start something with her?\"\\n\\n He looked miserable. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n No. This wasn\u0027t happening.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s this mean for us?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n The anger returned, and I leapt up, much to Aubrey\u0027s annoyance. \"What do you know?\" I demanded. \"Do you even know why you did this?\"\\n\\n \"There were a lot of things going on...\" he said. \"A lot of factors. It just happened...\"\\n\\n I put my hands on my hips and stalked toward him. \"Did it? Did it really? Because I\u0027m not so sure.\"\\n\\n His distraught expression turned wary. \"What\u0027s that mean?\"\\n\\n \"I think you were getting back at me for not giving in that night. I made you mad. I hurt you. So, you\u0027re trying to hurt me. Teach me a lesson.\"\\n\\n \"I - what? Are you insane? You think I\u0027d do something like this to teach you a lesson? You think I would want to hurt you? Just because you refused sex?\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" I asked. \"Guys always want sex from me. Why are you any different?\"\\n\\n \"Georgina,\" he said incredulously. \"You can\u0027t believe that. It\u0027s always been about more than sex. You have to know that. I\u0027ve told you that over and over. I would never purposely hurt you. And yet...\"\\n\\n \"And yet what?\"\\n\\n He looked away from me and focused on the carpet. \"I don\u0027t know that we can keep going on without me hurting you.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if you don\u0027t sleep with my friends - \"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t even have to be that. There are so many things it could be. I could get hit by a car tomorrow or catch some disease. If you ever do crack some day and sleep with me, you\u0027ll hate yourself forever. And if I crack and sell my soul, that\u0027s going to upset you too. One way or another, you will get hurt. It\u0027s just a matter of when. I saw it that night in the kitchen - I saw your face when you were yelling at me. That\u0027s when I knew it was all true.\"\\n\\n \"I...I was upset,\" I told him. \"And, I mean...we knew this relationship wouldn\u0027t be easy. You were okay with all this in the beginning...the sex and everything else....\"\\n\\n \"Things change,\" he said bluntly. He met my eyes, and I again saw warring sides within him. \"And back then, I thought I was the one who would get hurt, not you. I can handle it.\"\\n\\n \"Are you saying I can\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m saying I don\u0027t want to find out. And honestly, it\u0027s not even about sex either. We\u0027ve got communication problems, time problems...I don\u0027t know. Hell, we have death problems. I don\u0027t really know if we should keep doing this.\"\\n\\n It felt like Joel\u0027s death again, like all the energy was being sucked away from me.\\n\\n \"How,\" I demanded, \"can you always lecture me about open communication and then dump this on me now? If you were feeling all this...you should have brought it up beforehand, not in some bluff break-up at the zero hour.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not entirely sure what that last part meant, but I\u0027m not bluffing. And I\u0027ve tried to talk to you about this. I tried the night you massaged me - you didn\u0027t want to hear it.\" Seth took a deep breath. \"Georgina...I really mean it. I don\u0027t think we should be together anymore.\"\\n\\n I gaped. No, this wasn\u0027t right. This wasn\u0027t right at all. I\u0027d expected a big fight, one we\u0027d eventually get over, like always. I\u0027d expected him to ask for forgiveness. I\u0027d expected to set new boundaries in the relationship. I\u0027d expected me to be the one to have the high ground and decide if we were going to continue this.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t expected to be pleading.\\n\\n \"No. No. Seth...we\u0027ve just got to make it work. Look, I\u0027ll get over Maddie, okay? And if you want to sleep with other women...I mean, it is okay. I always said you could. It\u0027s just this first time...well, it\u0027s a shock, that\u0027s all.\" He just continued to watch me quietly, and I found myself babbling on more and more. \"But we can make it work. We always do. We\u0027ll find a way. You can\u0027t just go ahead and decide something like this on your own. There are two of us in this, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I do know. And I\u0027m one of the two. And I want to split up.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said frantically. \"You don\u0027t want to. This is just some weird...I don\u0027t know. You don\u0027t mean it.\"\\n\\n Seth\u0027s silence was more infuriating than if he\u0027d shouted back at me. He just kept watching me, letting me talk. His expression had so much regret - but so much determination too.\\n\\n \"You were the one who told me we could overcome anything,\" I cried. \"Why not this?\"\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s too late.\"\\n\\n \"It can\u0027t be. If you do this...it\u0027s all for nothing...you\u0027ll have ended up hurting me. Me and Maddie both.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a small hurt compared to what could really happen,\" he said. \"And as for Maddie...I don\u0027t plan on hurting her. I...I like her.\"\\n\\n \"But you love me.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I do. I probably always will. But maybe that\u0027s not enough. I have to move on. We can\u0027t do this. I think maybe...I don\u0027t know. I think something good could happen with me and Maddie. In some ways, she\u0027s like you, only - \"\\n\\n Seth had started to slip into the rambling he sometimes did when nervous enough. He bit his lip now, as though he might summon the words back, and looked away.\\n\\n \"Only what?\" I asked. I could barely hear my own voice.\\n\\n He turned his gaze back to me, firm and unflinching. \"Only...more human.\"\\n\\n And that was it. All the anger and sorrow vanished. There was nothing in me. Nothing at all. I was empty.\\n\\n \"Get out,\" I said.\\n\\n He paled. Something in my voice and expression must have been truly terrifying. Tentatively, he extended a hand.\\n\\n \"I never meant to hurt you. Thetis, I\u0027m sorr - \"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t ever call me that again,\" I told him, stepping away. I didn\u0027t know how any of these words were coming out of my mouth. It was like someone else was controlling me. \"Leave. Now.\"\\n\\n He opened his mouth, and I thought all that resolve he\u0027d just shown might crumble. In the end, it didn\u0027t.\\n\\n He left. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-24.html","bookId":2056,"book":{"id":2056,"title":"Succubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid #3)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 3: Succubus Dreams \\n especially when the girl in question is Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men.
