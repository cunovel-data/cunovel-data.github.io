{"id":110267,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"I\u0027d sworn I\u0027d never go back into my bedroom, but just then, I needed my bed. I spent the rest of the day in it, curled up in the proverbial fetal position. Much like when I\u0027d made Seth leave, I didn\u0027t feel anything. I was dead inside. There was nothing left, nothing in my life, nothing to keep me going. Some wise part of my brain said I should cry. I knew there was grief inside of me, grief that would eventually explode. But I was blocking it for now, afraid to acknowledge that all of this was real or face the consequences. This, I realized, was why Yasmine had screamed. It was a terrible thing to be cut off from something you loved so much. To be cut off from the thing that gave your existence meaning.\n Hours passed, and light and shadows moved across my bedroom as the sun began its descent. My room grew dark, but I didn\u0027t bother flipping on the lights. I didn\u0027t have the energy or motivation.\n I don\u0027t know how much time passed before I heard the knock. At first, I wasn\u0027t even sure that\u0027s what it was. Then, it sounded again - definitely someone knocking on my front door. I stayed in bed, not wanting to see or talk to anyone. What if it\u0027s Seth? Some small part of me clung to that hope, that maybe he\u0027d changed his mind. The rest of me didn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027d seen the look in his eyes. The resolve. He wasn\u0027t coming back. And if he wasn\u0027t coming back, then there was no point in being social.\n My visitor knocked a third time, louder still. Beside me, Aubrey turned her head toward the living room, then toward me, no doubt wondering why I wouldn\u0027t put a stop to the noise. With a sigh, I crawled out of bed and stalked toward the front of the apartment. Half-way there, I stopped. It wasn\u0027t Seth.\n \"Georgina!\" wailed a twangy soprano voice. \"I know you\u0027re in there. I can sense you.\" I\u0027d sensed Tawny too, of course, which is why I\u0027d stopped walking. I sighed again, wondering if it would be possible to ignore her. Probably not. Even if I didn\u0027t answer, she\u0027d probably stand out there all day, now that she knew I was here.\n I opened the door, expecting to be barreled into with tears and fanfare. Instead, I found Tawny standing calmly outside my door, hesitant to enter. Her eyes were wet after all, but she seemed to be trying very hard to rein herself in. The trembling of her lip suggested that wasn\u0027t going to be easy.\n And she had a glow.\n \"C-can I come in?\" she asked.\n I stepped to the side and waved her in. \"You want me to take you out for a drink to celebrate your conquest?\"\n That was it. She lost it. Sobbing into her hands, she sank down on to my loveseat. Still numbed from the Seth fallout, I had no mental energy to deal with this. Not enough energy to hate her, not enough energy to pity her. I was living apathy.\n \"Tawny, I - \"\n \"I\u0027m sorry!\" she interrupted. \"I\u0027m so, so sorry. I didn\u0027t want to. I didn\u0027t want to do it. But he told me if I did that it\u0027d pay off for both of us, that he\u0027d pull strings to get me faster advancement and that I\u0027d - \"\n \"Whoa, hang on,\" I said. \"Who\u0027s \u0027he\u0027? Niphon?\"\n She nodded and produced a pack of tissues from her purse. At least she traveled prepared now. She blew her nose loudly before going on. \"He told me to fake it - fake being bad. I mean...well, actually, I am kind of bad. Okay, a lot bad. I can\u0027t flirt like you. And I really can\u0027t dance.\" She paused a moment, as though this caused her particular pain. \"But you were right in saying it was impossible for me to not get sex from someone. I did. I just lied and said I couldn\u0027t.\"\n It was just as I\u0027d suspected for a while now, but hearing her confirm it didn\u0027t really cheer me up. It was yet another reminder of all the miserable things in my life these last couple of weeks. Staring at her, I still couldn\u0027t bring myself to feel angry at her. Partially because I was still drained of feeling and partially because it just wasn\u0027t worth it. Niphon had used her to play me, but he\u0027d played her too.\n \"You\u0027re a good liar,\" I told her finally. \"I could never be sure if you were telling the truth or not - but you seemed to be. I\u0027m usually good at reading people.\"\n Tawny smiled, just a little, with something almost like pride. \"I hustled people a lot when I was mortal. Worked some con jobs.\" The smile disappeared. \"Until that asshole dumped me for a cheap blond whore. She had no idea what she was doing, but did he care? No. Dick. He\u0027s sorry now. They both are.\"\n I blinked. I hadn\u0027t expected to hear that. I wasn\u0027t sure I wanted to hear that. Suddenly, Tawny\u0027s initial desire to make men everywhere suffer made a lot more sense - as did the reason she might have sold her soul in the first place. I hoped her current appearance wasn\u0027t some weird bastardization of the cheap blond whore. Because that would just be kind of creepy.\n \"Well, um, I\u0027m...sure they are. And you know, the skills you need to hustle and con aren\u0027t that different from seduction.\" Maybe it was the moving and talking, but as I sat there, my sluggish brain began to stir to life and analyze the situation. \"Tawny, why are you telling me this? If you\u0027re working for Niphon, he\u0027s probably not going to appreciate you blowing his cover.\"\n \"You\u0027re right. He doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m here. But...but I was afraid. I know it\u0027ll all come out if you tell, and I don\u0027t want to go down with him! I thought if I came and talked to you and told you what happened that maybe...maybe you could forgive me. I\u0027m starting to like it here. I don\u0027t want to leave. And if they punish him, they\u0027ll punish me too and - \"\n \"Wait, wait. Stop again. Punish him for what? For getting you to lie?\" I frowned. \"And what is it I\u0027m going to tell?\"\n Tawny was so surprised that she forgot to sniffle. \"About her.\"\n \"Her?\"\n \"That - that hag. The one who came into my dreams...\"\n \"Nyx? Oh. That really is how you hid your glow. Hugh was right.\"\n \"I hated it,\" said Tawny vehemently. \"Every time he made me go to her so she could suck me out. And then I\u0027d have such weird dreams.\"\n Think, Georgina, think! It was all coming together here if I could just put my own romantic disaster off to the side of my mind for a moment.\n \"You...went to Nyx willingly? To have your energy sucked out so I wouldn\u0027t find out that you were lying?\" Tawny nodded. My brain hurt. \"And he - Niphon - made you, and - \" I stopped. \"Niphon knew about Nyx. You both did. And how to find her.\"\n \"He\u0027s the one who got her to come here when she escaped. Promised her two succubi,\" sniffed Tawny. She gave me a puzzled look. \"I thought...I thought you knew all that? I heard you were there when they captured her...\"\n Tawny looked a little nervous, like she was wondering if maybe she\u0027d done the wrong thing in betraying Niphon. As for me, I was suddenly reliving the battle back in my bedroom and Nyx\u0027s offer to help me get revenge on the one who\u0027d sent her after me....\n Niphon.\n \"Niphon?\" I exclaimed. \"Niphon sent a crazy chaos goddess after me? Why? Why does he hate me that much?\"\n Tawny\u0027s eyes went wide, no doubt surprised at my sudden outburst. \"I...I don\u0027t know. He just said that he wanted to make things difficult for you. Screw up your life. Maybe get you sent away.\"\n Hugh\u0027s words came back to me. All I know is that when an imp shows up and is going to this much trouble over something, the evidence suggests it\u0027s big.\n My heart raced, and I grabbed hold of her hand. \"Tawny. Did he ever say anything about my contract? Any contract at all?\"\n She shook her head frantically, tousling her blond curls even more than they already were. \"No, not while I was around.\"\n \"Are you sure? Think! Think of anything, anything at all he might have said to explain why he did what he did.\"\n \"No, nothing!\" She broke her hand away. \"I\u0027m telling you the truth this time. He just made it sound as though...well, like he didn\u0027t like you. He wanted you to be unhappy. Suffer. I don\u0027t know.\"\n Niphon. So many things could be laid at his feet.\n According to Tawny, he\u0027d used her to make me look like a bad mentor (which I was, kind of) and possibly get sent away. The imp had also talked to Seth about selling his soul - despite my warnings. Seth\u0027s decision to leave me had been his own, true. But, I realized, Niphon had played a role in getting Seth to think about such things. The distraction Nyx had caused - which apparently Niphon had brought about too - had cut me off from spending time with Seth. Realizing how close he\u0027d been to selling his soul had driven Seth away. The fear of how that would affect him and me both had been too strong - strong enough that he chose to walk away from me.\n \"Georgina?\"\n I made a decision then. It wasn\u0027t going to change what had happened with Seth and me, but it was going to make me feel better.\n \"Georgina?\" repeated Tawny, peering at me. \"Are you okay? You aren\u0027t going to get me sent away, are you? Georgina?\"\n I rose from my chair, surprised at how my muscles had become kinked. No longer wanting to be dressed up, I shape-shifted out of the dress and into jeans and an empire cut sweater. Black. Like my mood. I glanced over at Tawny.\n \"You want to go to a party with me?\"\n I drove us over to Peter and Cody\u0027s, where the \"evil\" holiday party was taking place. I barely noticed that it was raining again. I walked up the building\u0027s stairs like one going to her own funeral, grim and purposeful - and with enough speed that Tawny had to scurry to keep up in her stilettos. When I felt the immortal signatures within the apartment, smug relief flooded me upon discovering Niphon was still there.\n Peter opened the door before I finished knocking. He wore a red sweater with an appliqu¨¦ Santa on it. It matched his tree, of course.\n \"Look at this,\" he said sarcastically. \"She deigns to show up and join us lowly - \"\n I strode past him without a word. He gaped. Moving through the room, I was vaguely aware of the others there. Jerome. Cody. Hugh. But I didn\u0027t want any of them.\n Niphon, standing with a glass of wine, regarded me with curious amusement as I headed straight for him. Considering I usually avoided him if it all possible, my approach undoubtedly astonished him.\n But not as much as when I punched him.\n I didn\u0027t even need to shape-shift much bulk into my fist. I\u0027d caught him by surprise. The wineglass fell out of his hand, hitting the carpet and spilling its contents like blood. The imp flew backward, hitting Peter\u0027s china cabinet with a crash. Niphon slumped to the floor, eyes wide with shock. I kept coming. Kneeling, I grabbed his designer shirt and jerked him toward me.\n \"Stay the fuck out of my life, or I will destroy you,\" I hissed.\n Terror filled his features. \"Are you out of your fucking mind? What do you - \" Suddenly, the fear disappeared. He started laughing. \"He did it, didn\u0027t he? He broke up with you. I didn\u0027t know if he could do it, even after giving him the spiel about how it\u0027d be better for both of you. Oh my. This is lovely. All your so-called charms weren\u0027t enough to - ahh!\"\n I\u0027d pulled him closer to me, digging my nails into him, and finally, I felt an emotion. Fury. Niphon\u0027s role had been greater than I believed. My face was mere inches from his.\n \"Remember when you said I was nothing but a backwoods girl from some gritty fishing village? You were right. And I had to survive in gritty circumstances - in situations you\u0027d never be able to handle. And you know what else? I spent most of my childhood gutting fish and other animals.\" I ran a finger down his neck. \"I can do it for you too. I could slit you from throat to stomach. I could rip you open, and you\u0027d scream for death. You\u0027d wish you weren\u0027t immortal. And I could do it over and over again.\"\n That wiped the smirk off Niphon\u0027s face. Behind me, the rest of the room had come to life.\n \"For fuck\u0027s sake,\" yelled Jerome. \"Get her off him.\"\n Strong hands pulled me back, Cody and Hugh each grabbing one of my arms. I fought against them, struggling to get back to a cringing Niphon. My friends were too strong. I couldn\u0027t break free and didn\u0027t have the life left to shape-shift added bulk.\n \"Get rid of him, Jerome!\" I yelled. \"Get rid of him, or I swear to God, I really will rip him apart. He set me up to fail with Tawny. He brought Nyx here, for fuck\u0027s sake! Get rid of him!\"\n I saw my boss\u0027s face. He didn\u0027t like being yelled at or ordered around - particularly in front of others. His face was hard and angry. I could tell he was about to tell me to shut up, and then something in his expression shifted. He turned his attention back to Niphon.\n \"Get out,\" the demon said.\n Niphon stared open-mouthed. Very fishlike, actually.\n \"Jerome! You can\u0027t just - \"\n \"Get out. I know what you were trying to do, but you shouldn\u0027t have done it behind my back. Go back to your hotel, and be out of town by tomorrow.\"\n Niphon still wanted to protest. But then, he looked at Jerome, looked at me, and then looked at Jerome again. Swallowing, the imp scrambled to his feet and grabbed a briefcase sitting on the couch. With one more glance back at me, he ran out the door.\n Jerome\u0027s gaze fell on Tawny, who was pressing herself against the wall in a futile effort to disappear.\n \"It\u0027s not her fault,\" I said quickly. \"Don\u0027t punish her.\"\n Jerome studied her a few more moments before sighing impatiently. \"Later. I\u0027ll deal with you later.\" I wasn\u0027t sure if that was a good thing or not, but the fact that he hadn\u0027t smote her on the spot was a positive sign. Judging from the grateful look on her face, she agreed.\n Cody and Hugh still had a death grip on me, but after several moments, they released me. I sagged with exhaustion, surprised to see I was breathing heavily.\n Tension filled the room. Finally, Cody said, \"Where did you learn to throw a right hook?\"\n \"You don\u0027t live through the Dark Ages without learning stuff like that,\" mused Peter. He glanced at the spilled wine and sighed. \"Club soda\u0027s not going to get that out.\"\n \"Georgie,\" said Jerome in a rumbling voice. \"Do not ever speak to me like that.\"\n I steadied my breathing and swallowed back the bloodlust coursing through me. I met Jerome\u0027s dark eyes defiantly.\n \"Noted,\" I said. Then, unable to handle my friends\u0027 looks of both astonishment and concern, I ran out of the apartment. I made it down one flight of stairs before collapsing and sitting on the landing. I buried my face in my hands and started sobbing. The grief had finally won.\n A few minutes later, I heard footsteps on the stairs. Hugh sat down beside me and put his arms around me. I pressed my face to his chest and kept crying.\n \"You\u0027ll get over this,\" he said quietly.\n \"No. I will never get over this. I\u0027m alone. I wish I was dead.\"\n \"No, you don\u0027t. You\u0027re too wonderful and have too many people who love you.\"\n I lifted my head and looked at him. I\u0027d never seen his face so compassionate, so serious - except when he\u0027d yelled at Seth during poker. I sniffed and ran a hand over my wet eyes.\n \"We broke up. This is what you wanted. You didn\u0027t want me and Seth to be together.\"\n Hugh shook his head. \"I like Seth. I want you to be happy. If you could be together without all the heartache, I\u0027d send you on with my blessing. But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s possible. I think this is best.\"\n \"You told him the only way I\u0027d let him go is if he hurt me, if he was an asshole. Do you think that\u0027s why he did it? Slept with Maddie? Because only something drastic would drive me away?\"\n Hugh looked surprised at the reference to Maddie. \"I don\u0027t know, sweetie. I don\u0027t know what he was thinking.\"\n Sighing, I leaned back into him. \"I will never get over this.\"\n \"You will.\"\n \"It\u0027s going to take a lot of time.\"\n \"Well, you have a lot of time.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-25.html","bookId":2056,"book":{"id":2056,"title":"Succubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 3: Succubus Dreams \n especially when the girl in question is Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men.
