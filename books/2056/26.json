{"id":110268,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"New Year\u0027s Eve. Warren, Emerald City\u0027s owner, had thrown a swank party at his house and invited the whole staff, along with about fifty others. His house was enormous, and he\u0027d spared no expense. Waiters worked the crowd. A bartender made drinks with great flourish. A DJ spun music in the corner. It was probably the most elaborate party I\u0027d been to all year. Everyone was having a great time. Well, except me, naturally. Maddie and Seth were there. Together. It was strange to see them out as a couple so openly, after all the time he and I had spent hiding our relationship. But when she\u0027d arrived back in Seattle a few days ago, she\u0027d made no attempts at secrecy. Everyone at the store had known within twenty-four hours, and it was still a source of much buzzing and speculation. The general consensus was that they were cute. And, watching them, I supposed that if I weren\u0027t so intimately involved, I\u0027d think they were cute too. Mostly they made me want to go throw up the caviar I\u0027d just eaten. They stood together with a few other staff across the room, holding hands. Maddie glowed like a succubus, talking animatedly to Beth about something. Seth, dressed up for a change and looking gorgeous, listened with a small smile - though there was something solemn in his eyes. He looked uncomfortable, and I strongly suspected he\u0027d been brought here at Maddie\u0027s urging. I didn\u0027t think he was the type who\u0027d come and rub their relationship in my face, but then, I\u0027d never thought he\u0027d break up with me either. Just then, he glanced up to scan the room and met my gaze. By accident or on purpose, I couldn\u0027t say. We held each other\u0027s eyes for a moment. His expression grew troubled, wistful. I don\u0027t know what mine looked like. A moment later, he turned his attention back to the others. But the small smile was gone. \"Makes you want to brush your teeth, doesn\u0027t it?\" Doug approached me, holding what I believed to be his fifth rum and coke. I pointed to it. \"What, all that sugar you\u0027re drinking?\" He grinned. \"I mean my sister and Mortensen, as well you know.\" I gave them one more glance, then turned back to him. \"Everyone thinks they\u0027re cute.\" \"I guess. I can\u0027t decide how to feel.\" He knocked back his drink. \"I mean, he\u0027s sleeping with my sister, right? I\u0027m supposed to be, like, outraged and want to defend her honor. Or something. But part of me\u0027s thinking maybe they\u0027ll hit it off so well that she\u0027ll move in with him. And that kind of makes me...happy.\" Ugh. Bad enough they were dating at all. Moving in together? I couldn\u0027t even think that far ahead. They\u0027d only been an item for a week. I silently counted to five and tried not to say something I\u0027d regret. \"Who can say?\" I murmured vaguely. Doug tilted his head as he regarded me. \"Always figured you\u0027d be the one going after him, what with your hero worship and his erotic stories about you.\" He was referring to a short story of Seth\u0027s that had appeared in a magazine not too long ago. The kinky heroine bore an uncanny - and completely coincidental - resemblance to me. I could tell by his voice and face that Doug was joking. He\u0027d never believed there had been anything between Seth and me. Little did he know how close to home his joke hit. \"Well,\" I told him. \"Looks like your sister\u0027s going to be the one in the erotic stories now.\" Doug paled. \"Oh my God. I never thought of that.\" He glanced at his empty glass. \"I gotta get another one.\" I watched him go and felt a smile tug at my lips, despite my resolution to be miserable. And I was definitely doing a good job at the miserable part. I didn\u0027t approach anyone at the party and only spoke a few words to those who tried to engage me in conversation. I\u0027d already turned down several men who\u0027d tried to fetch me a drink or get me to dance. I just wanted to be alone. Really, I shouldn\u0027t have come. \"Never thought I\u0027d see you alone at an event like this.\" I\u0027d felt his presence behind me before I heard him. \"Carter, you party crasher. I know you didn\u0027t get an invitation.\" \"Hey, I heard this was the place to be.\" \"Isn\u0027t crashing one of the seven deadly - holy shit.\" The angel had stepped in front of me. His chin-length blond hair was washed and brushed, and he wore khakis and a blue polo shirt. The ensemble was utterly casual and also the nicest thing I\u0027d ever seen him in. He laughed, knowing what had surprised me. \"I couldn\u0027t show up like I usually do. I\u0027m still underdressed compared to you.\" I had on a form-fitting satin dress with a collar that went all the way up to my neck. Black. Like my mood. \"Yeah,\" I said, \"but if we\u0027re measuring comparison to our normal ware, you\u0027re the best-dressed person in here.\" \"This is a great party,\" he said, eyeing the room. He had a drink in his hand that I swore he hadn\u0027t had a moment ago. \"You don\u0027t look like you\u0027re having a very good time.\" I wasn\u0027t ready to talk about that yet, not to him. Averting my eyes, I stared absentmindedly to where Doug was hitting on some woman about twenty years older than he was. The DJ\u0027s current song ended, and the guitar notes of a new one kicked up. \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" \"Oh, fuck,\" I said. \"What?\" asked Carter. \"I hate this song.\" \"Really? I\u0027ve always liked it.\" I sighed. \"What happened to Yasmine?\" His mocking humor faded. \"You know what happened to her. She belongs to Hell now. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll make good use of her.\" \"But will she do it?\" I asked. \"Will she really turn her back on Heaven and fight?\" \"They always do.\" It was exactly what Vincent had said. \"Once she\u0027s spent enough time shunned by other angels and denied the face of the divine...well, she\u0027ll want to fight against Heaven.\" \"That\u0027s stupid. It\u0027s like she\u0027s...I don\u0027t know. Like she\u0027s being forced to go bad.\" \"She made the decision to fall.\" \"She did it out of love! You\u0027re always telling me that love is the most wonderful thing in the universe.\" \"It is. But an angel\u0027s love must be given to the power above first, then to humanity as a whole second. It can\u0027t be bestowed on just one person - human or nephilim.\" \"That\u0027s stupid. I think the nephilim have it right thinking all of us are messed up.\" I handed my glass to a passing waitress. It had been empty for a while. Hesitantly, I brought up something that was still troubling me, something this song wouldn\u0027t let me forget. \"Carter...about Nyx. Her visions...are they always true?\" \"As far as I know. They don\u0027t always play out like people think, though. Why do you ask?\" \"No reason. Well, I mean, just curious about what she showed me.\" \"Ah. Yeah, that\u0027s tricky.\" He frowned. \"Since she was actually manipulating you, it\u0027s hard to say...I don\u0027t know everything about her. What\u0027d she show you?\" \"It\u0027s not impor - \" The music abruptly stopped, and from across the room, I heard someone shouting numbers. \"Ten...nine...\" I looked at a nearby clock. Nearly midnight. \"Eight...seven...\" People were getting out noise makers and drinks. Couples were getting close. \"Six...five...\" Maddie drew close to Seth. He leaned down toward her, looking nervous. \"Four...three...\" I clutched Carter\u0027s arm. I couldn\u0027t watch this. I couldn\u0027t watch Seth and Maddie kiss. \"Get me out of here,\" I gasped, suddenly having trouble breathing. \"Two...\" \"Carter! Get me - \" The world exploded in color around me. Cold night air blasted my face. Disoriented, I staggered and felt Carter catch my arm to steady me. We stood on top of a roof, directly facing the Space Needle. Fireworks burst around it in showers of rainbow sparks. The accompanying noise startled me, and I gasped. Farther away, other fireworks sparkled on the horizon. \"Best view in the city,\" joked Carter. I stared around, still confused, until I was finally able to triangulate our position. \"We\u0027re on top of the bookstore.\" He released my arm, and we stood there watching the fireworks for several minutes. We were so close to the Space Needle that I could soon smell the smoke as the wind blew over us. I started to rub my arms, then remembered to shape-shift on a coat. \"A new year has all sorts of possibilities, Georgina,\" Carter finally said, eyes still on the show. \"Not for me. I\u0027ve lost all mine. I\u0027ve lost Seth. I screwed up.\" \"It\u0027s not all your fault. Relationships are symbiotic. Takes two to make them work, two to make them fall apart. Seth\u0027s got plenty of blame in this.\" I shook my head. \"No...the things he did. It was my fault.\" \"You\u0027re missing the big picture, Daughter of Lilith. You\u0027re forgetting Niphon\u0027s role. What was he trying to do?\" \"Ruin my life,\" I said bitterly. \"He had a part, yeah, but he complicated what I\u0027d already messed up.\" \"Why? Why\u0027d he do it?\" \"Because he hates me.\" Carter sighed. \"You\u0027re not getting it.\" I turned toward him. \"What do you mean? What more is there to get?\" \"Only so much I can tell you. Only so much I can interfere.\" He fell silent as a particularly showy burst of silver sparkles lit the night sky. The deli conversation with Hugh came back to me. \"Did...did he really mess something up with my contract? Is it flawed?\" \"That\u0027s your side\u0027s business. I can\u0027t tell you anything about that.\" He sighed once more. \"I can tell you that eternity is an awfully long time to keep accruing and carrying around guilt.\" \"Why do you care so much?\" I demanded. \"Why do you care so much about what happens to me and Seth?\" He looked back down at me. \"I like happy endings. I like helping make them happen.\" \"Yeah, well. You kind of fucked this one up.\" His old, cynical smile returned. \"You want to go home?\" I turned toward the Space Needle. \"I want to finish the show.\" \"Okay.\" \"Oh, hey. Wait.\" I reached into my purse and pulled out a cashmere knit hat. I handed it to him. \"Merry Christmas. Sorry I didn\u0027t wrap it.\" Carter examined his Secret Santa present, then put it on. \"Neat.\" When he did finally take me home, he used the same angelic teleportation that always made me slightly nauseous. Aubrey greeted my entrance, rubbing against my legs as I fumbled for the lights. Beneath the floor, it sounded like my neighbors were having a party. I kicked my heels off in the middle of the living room floor and walked toward my bedroom, unbuttoning my dress as I went. I let it fall to the floor, happy to be free of the tight fabric. Opening my closet door, I knelt down and began rummaging through it until I unearthed the old shoe box again. Reaching up to the spot just above my breastbone, I found Seth\u0027s ring on its chain. I unfastened it and held the ring in one hand for a long time, staring at its smooth, shining surface and winking sapphires. I took out the old worn ring from the box and held it in my other hand. For a while, I just sat there, looking back and forth between the two. They were different...and yet so alike. You were destined for heartache. And are going to repeat that forever. You aren\u0027t learning. You aren\u0027t changing. With a sigh, I placed both rings into the box, next to a heavy gold cross. I closed the lid and shoved it all back into the closet. It was over. It was all over. Still half-naked, I walked back to where I\u0027d dropped my purse and found my cell phone. I dialed a number and waited. \"Hello?\" \"Dante? This is Georgina.\" \"Who?\" With a start, I realized I\u0027d never actually told him my name. \"The succubus.\" \"Oh.\" I had a feeling he\u0027d already recognized my voice. \"Happy New Year.\" I took a deep breath. \"Are you free tonight?\" There was a long, pregnant pause. \"What about the man in the dream?\" he finally asked. \"There is no man in the dream.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-26.html","bookId":2056,"book":{"id":2056,"title":"Succubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid #3)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 3: Succubus Dreams especially when the girl in question is Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men.
