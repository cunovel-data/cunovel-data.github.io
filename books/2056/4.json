{"id":110247,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The next day, I went to the address on Dante\u0027s business card. It was in Rainier Valley, which wasn\u0027t exactly rundown but wasn\u0027t upwardly mobile either. The directions led to a narrow shop jammed in between a barber and a shady-looking convenience store. PSYCHIC hung in red neon letters in the window. The \"I\" had burned out. Underneath it, a handwritten sign read: PALM READING \u0026 TAROT CARDS.\\n\\n I stepped through the door, making bells ring. The interior proved to be as barren as the exterior. A narrow counter flanked one wall. The rest of the small, stark space was empty, save for a round table covered in red velvet that had cigarette burns on it. A tacky crystal ball sat on top. This place was a wasteland compared to Erik\u0027s warm, inviting shop.\\n\\n \"Just a minute,\" a voice called from an open doorway in the back. \"I\u0027ve just got to - \"\\n\\n A man entered the room and stopped when he saw me. He was about six-foot, with black hair pulled back in a ponytail. Two days worth of facial hair covered his face, and he wore jeans and a plain black T-shirt. Early forties, maybe, and pretty cute. He looked me over from head to toe and gave me a sly, knowing smile.\\n\\n \"Well, hello. What do we have here?\" He tilted his head, still studying me. \"Not human, that\u0027s for sure. Demon? No, not strong enough. Vampire? No...not this time of day.\"\\n\\n \"I...\" I stopped, surprised that he\u0027d sensed something in me. He had no immortal signature; he was definitely human. He must be like Erik, I realized. A mortal who could sense the immortal world, though he didn\u0027t have enough skill to pinpoint what I was exactly. Deciding there was no point in subterfuge, I said, \"I\u0027m a succubus.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"No, you aren\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I am.\"\\n\\n \"You aren\u0027t.\"\\n\\n I was a bit surprised to be having this conversation. \"I am too.\"\\n\\n \"No. Succubi are flame-eyed and bat-winged. Everyone knows that. They don\u0027t wear jeans and sweaters. At the very least, you should have a bigger chest. What are you, 34B or something?\"\\n\\n \"C,\" I said indignantly.\\n\\n \"If you say so.\"\\n\\n \"Look, I am a succubus. I can prove it.\" I let my form change, shifting through several different female variations before returning to my usual one. \"See?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll be damned.\"\\n\\n I had a feeling he was playing with me. \"Are you Dante?\"\\n\\n \"For now.\" He approached and shook my hand, holding on to it. He flipped it over. \"You here for a palm reading? I\u0027ll show you how to shape-shift your hand to get a good future.\"\\n\\n I took my hand back. \"No, thanks. I\u0027m here because I have some questions...questions that Erik Lancaster thought you might be able to answer.\"\\n\\n Dante\u0027s smile dropped. He rolled his eyes and walked over to the counter. \"Oh. Him.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean? Erik\u0027s my friend.\"\\n\\n Dante leaned his back against the counter and crossed his arms over his chest. \"Of course he\u0027s your friend. He\u0027s everyone\u0027s friend. Fucking boy scout. If he could have shaken his holier-than-thou attitude and worked with me, we could have made a fortune by now.\"\\n\\n I remembered what Erik had said about Dante being a con artist and a Hell-bound person. I didn\u0027t pick up any evil vibes off him, but there was a definite abrasiveness to his attitude that made Erik\u0027s assessment more plausible.\\n\\n \"Erik has standards,\" I declared.\\n\\n Dante laughed. \"Oh, great. A holier-than-thou succubus. This is going to be fun.\"\\n\\n \"Look, can you just answer my questions? It won\u0027t take long.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got time - at least until the next rush of customers.\" The bitter tone in his voice as he gestured to the empty room indicated that there hadn\u0027t been a rush in a very long time.\\n\\n \"I had a dream the other night,\" I explained. \"And when I woke up, all my energy was gone.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a succubus. Supposedly. That kind of thing happens.\"\\n\\n \"I wish everyone would stop saying that! This wasn\u0027t normal. And I\u0027d been with a man the night before. I was charged up, so to speak.\"\\n\\n \"You do anything afterward that would have depleted the energy?\"\\n\\n Everyone kept asking that too. \"No. I just went to bed. But the dream...it was really strange. I don\u0027t know how to explain it. Really, really vivid. I\u0027ve never felt anything like it.\"\\n\\n \"What was it about?\"\\n\\n \"A, um, dishwasher.\"\\n\\n Dante sighed. \"Did someone pay you to come here and mess with me?\"\\n\\n Through gritted teeth, I related the dream.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it?\" he asked when I finished.\\n\\n \"Yup.\"\\n\\n \"Lame dream.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know what it means?\"\\n\\n \"Probably that you need to fix your dishwasher.\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t broken!\"\\n\\n He straightened up. \"Sorry. Can\u0027t help you then.\"\\n\\n \"Erik said this was your specialty.\"\\n\\n \"It is, I suppose. But, sometimes a dream is just a dream. You sure you don\u0027t want me to read your palm? It\u0027s all bullshit, but I can at least make something up so you feel like the trip wasn\u0027t wasted.\"\\n\\n \"No, I want to know about my fucking dream. How can it be just a dream if I woke up with no energy?\"\\n\\n Dante walked back over to me and flicked a piece of escaped hair out of his face. \"I don\u0027t know. You aren\u0027t giving me enough to go on. How many times has it happened?\"\\n\\n \"Just the one time.\"\\n\\n \"Then it may be just a fluke, kiddo.\"\\n\\n I turned toward the door. \"Well, thanks for the \u0027help.\u0027\"\\n\\n Hurrying over to my side, Dante caught my arm. \"Hey, wait. You want to go get a drink now?\"\\n\\n \"I - what?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll risk upsetting the masses and close up shop for the day. There\u0027s a great bar around the corner. Draft Budweiser - only a dollar a glass during happy hour. My treat.\"\\n\\n I scoffed. I didn\u0027t know what was more absurd. That Dante thought I\u0027d go out with him or that he thought I\u0027d drink Budweiser. His attractiveness wasn\u0027t enough to make up for his weird personality.\\n\\n \"Sorry. I have a boyfriend.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not looking to be your boyfriend. Cheap sex is fine with me.\"\\n\\n I met his eyes. They were gray, similar to Carter\u0027s but without the silvery hue. I expected a joke here, but despite the perpetual smirk, Dante appeared to be perfectly serious.\\n\\n \"Why on earth do you think I\u0027d have cheap sex with you? Do I look that easy?\"\\n\\n \"You say you\u0027re a succubus. You\u0027re easy by definition. And even without the bat-wings and flame-eyes, you\u0027re pretty cute.\"\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you worried about your soul?\" Even if he was as corrupt as Erik had insinuated - and I still wasn\u0027t really seeing that - Dante would take some kind of hit from sleeping with me. All mortals did. Of course, I\u0027d met plenty of men - good and evil alike - who\u0027d been willing to risk their souls for sex.\\n\\n \"Nope. My soul\u0027s pretty far gone. This would just be for fun. Look, if you want to skip the beer, we can just get right to it. I\u0027ve always wanted to do it on the table over there.\"\\n\\n \"Un-fucking-believable.\" I pushed open the door.\\n\\n \"Oh, come on,\" he pleaded. \"I\u0027m pretty good. And hey, maybe your boyfriend\u0027s poor sexual performance is what\u0027s stressing you out and taking away your energy.\"\\n\\n \"Not likely,\" I told him. \"We don\u0027t have sex.\"\\n\\n There was a moment\u0027s silence, then Dante threw back his head and laughed. \"Did it occur to you that maybe that\u0027s stressing you out? Clearly the dishwasher is a metaphor for your broken sex life, which then forces you to wash dishes \u0027by hand.\u0027\"\\n\\n I left, heading back to the bookstore where I could get a little respect. Some dream expert Dante had turned out to be. I could see now why Erik didn\u0027t really like him. I was also starting to wonder if maybe everyone was right. Maybe I had mentally burned myself out. Maybe the dream was really just a dream.\\n\\n I was almost at the bookstore when I got a phone call.\\n\\n \"Miss Kincaid?\" asked a pleasant female voice. \"This is Karen from the Seattle Children\u0027s Alliance, calling to confirm your participation in our auction this week.\"\\n\\n \"Your what?\"\\n\\n There was a pause. \"Our charity date auction, to raise money for the Alliance.\"\\n\\n I was still baffled. \"Um, sounds like a great cause, but I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n I heard papers being ruffled. \"We have you listed as a volunteer.\"\\n\\n \"For what, to be auctioned off for a date?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. It looks like...here we are. Your name was submitted by Dr. Mitchell.\"\\n\\n I sighed. \"Let me call you back.\" I hung up and dialed Hugh. \"Hey, Dr. Mitchell. You volunteered me to be auctioned off?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that different from what you usually do,\" he argued. \"And it\u0027s for charity.\"\\n\\n \"I buy the peace-on-Earth-and-good-will-toward-men thing from Peter and Cody - but not from you. You don\u0027t care about those kids.\"\\n\\n \"I care about the group\u0027s director,\" Hugh said. \"She\u0027s a fucking fox. I get some high quality candidates to raise money, and I can probably get her in bed.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re using a children\u0027s charity to further your sex life. That\u0027s horrible. And why didn\u0027t you ask Tawny? If anyone needs a date, she does.\"\\n\\n \"Her? Jesus Christ. It\u0027d be a disaster. We\u0027re trying to make money here. Do you hate kids or something?\"\\n\\n \"No, but I don\u0027t have time to do it. I\u0027ll write them a check.\"\\n\\n I hung up on his protests, just as I turned onto Queen Anne Avenue. I was a little early for my shift and decided to stop home and grab an apple and a granola bar. Last time I\u0027d worked, we\u0027d been so busy that I\u0027d skipped my lunch break. I figured that this time, I should come prepared. My immortality wouldn\u0027t let me starve to death, but I could still get lightheaded and weak.\\n\\n Halfway down the hall to my apartment, I felt a shock wave of crystalline goodness. Angelic auras. I opened my door and found the whole gang: Carter, Yasmine, Whitney, Joel, and Vincent. None of them spoke; they were all just watching me expectantly. The angels would have sensed me long before I sensed them. They all sat in my living room, casually occupying my sofa and chairs as though they weren\u0027t a host of heavenly warriors. Well, not all of them were casual. Joel sat as stiff and formal as he had the first time I met him.\\n\\n \"Oh, man,\" I said, shutting the door behind me. \"It\u0027s just like that They Might Be Giants song.\"\\n\\n Vincent grinned. \"\u0027She\u0027s an Angel\u0027?\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"Somewhere they\u0027re meeting on a pinhead - \"\\n\\n \" - calling you an angel, calling you the nicest things,\" he finished.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" demanded Joel, interrupting our jam session.\\n\\n \"Or not so nice,\" I muttered. I turned from Vincent and glared at Joel. \"I live here, remember?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re having a meeting,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Hey, when you asked if Vince could stay here, you never said anything about making this your top secret tree house headquarters. I don\u0027t care if you guys hold your choir practice here or whatever, but don\u0027t try to throw me out while you do.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" said Yasmine. I did a double-take. Apologies from angels were about as rare as from demons. From the look on his face, Joel was about as surprised as me. \"We probably should have asked first. We can go somewhere else.\" She leaned over my coffee table and started gathering up newspapers. Interesting. Apparently Vincent\u0027s fixation with the news was more than just a personal hobby. I glanced back up at Yasmine and tried to act like I hadn\u0027t noticed anything.\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s fine. I\u0027m actually heading right back out. I just came by for some food.\"\\n\\n She pushed strands of long, black hair out of her face. They\u0027d slipped out of her ponytail. \"You want Vince to make you something?\"\\n\\n He turned to her, startled, wearing an astonished, yet still-amused look. \"What am I, your personal assistant?\"\\n\\n \"Not with the kind of respect you show us,\" she grumbled.\\n\\n I hid a smile. \"Thanks, but I\u0027m fine. I don\u0027t have the time.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Joel. \"Then hurry up.\"\\n\\n Whitney sighed and looked a little embarrassed - but not enough to contradict him. Yasmine had no such qualms and elbowed him in the ribs. \"What was that for?\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n \"You have no manners,\" she scolded.\\n\\n Grinning broadly, I went to the kitchen and found an apple. When I opened the cupboard to look for my granola bars, I found the box empty. \"Hey,\" I said, carrying it out to the living room. \"Did somebody eat these? I had two left this morning.\"\\n\\n Carter spoke up for the first time. \"I was hungry.\"\\n\\n I stared at him, incredulous. \"You ate both of them?\"\\n\\n \"I was hungry,\" he repeated, not looking contrite in the least.\\n\\n \"Does it ever stop with you?\" I exclaimed. \"First the Christmas tree, now this? You didn\u0027t even throw the box away!\"\\n\\n \"I was hoping you\u0027d forgotten about the Christmas tree. That was an accident, and you know it.\"\\n\\n I sighed loudly and put the apple in my purse.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to the grocery store later,\" said Vincent helpfully. Aubrey jumped up and settled herself between him and Yasmine. Both their hands instantly moved to pet her. Aubrey gave me a smug cat look at the attention. \"I\u0027ll pick you up some more if you want.\"\\n\\n \"Pick him up some more so that he doesn\u0027t go rob the food bank next. See you guys later. No wild parties while I\u0027m gone.\" Carter, Yasmine, and Vincent laughed; Whitney and Joel didn\u0027t.\\n\\n When I\u0027d shut the door behind me, I paused in the hall, wishing there was some way to spy on angels. There wasn\u0027t, unfortunately. I couldn\u0027t even hide from them. They could mask their signatures from me, but not vice versa. In fact, they all knew I hadn\u0027t left yet. Annoyed, I headed downstairs, curiosity burning in me. Why were they all here? Why did they need a human? And what role did the newspapers play?\\n\\n Figuring out what angels did with their time was always difficult. With my side, it was pretty straightforward. We were always looking to commit souls to Hell and did so in a well-monitored, micro-managed manner. Heaven\u0027s forces moved in mysterious ways, though. Carter\u0027s purpose in Seattle was a continual puzzle for my friends and me since none of us ever saw any evidence of him doing anything particularly noble, aside from sharing his cigarettes. He did always show a lot of interest in my love life and was quick to dispense cryptic pieces of advice, but I suspected that was more curiosity than altruism.\\n\\n Work was only a few blocks away. Since it wasn\u0027t raining, I simply walked down there. As soon as I entered Emerald City, Maddie approached me, an uncomfortable expression on her face.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" she said uneasily. \"I, um, need your advice. I\u0027m going to a wedding tomorrow and don\u0027t know what to wear. This is so stupid...but could you take a look at my options?\"\\n\\n Peering around, I decided the store could function without us for ten minutes, particularly since it had taken Maddie a fair amount of courage to broach this subject. I\u0027d never actually seen her dress up before. \"Okay. Let\u0027s see what you\u0027ve got.\"\\n\\n We went back to my office, and she tried on three different dresses. No doubt Seth would have been amused to know she was changing clothes while I was in there.\\n\\n When she\u0027d finished, I gave my honest opinion. \"They don\u0027t do you justice.\"\\n\\n \"Which is a nice way of saying they look awful on me.\" Maddie balled one of the dresses up and tossed it to the floor. \"I hate this sort of thing. How can I write about women\u0027s issues and not be any good at them?\"\\n\\n \"Well...you write about different kinds of issues. The problem here is that you\u0027re wearing clothes that are too big for you.\"\\n\\n Her dark eyes widened in surprise. \"I\u0027m big. They\u0027re loose. They hide it.\"\\n\\n Maddie wasn\u0027t big, not really. She was a size ten or twelve, if I had to guess, and her short height emphasized that a little. But her curves were all proportioned correctly, and she had a very pretty face. Of course, compared to the anorexic models so popular among humans today, I could understand her attitude.\\n\\n \"You are not big. But those dresses make you look it. Something smaller\u0027s going to make you look better.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t wear tight clothes.\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t have to be tight. They just have to fit.\"\\n\\n Maddie sighed and ran her hands down the sides of her thighs. \"You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like,\" she said, the slightest accusatory note in her voice. \"You\u0027re beautiful and tiny. Not all of us have the luxury of looking perfect all the time.\"\\n\\n \"No one looks perfect all the time,\" I argued. \"I certainly don\u0027t.\" Okay, I kind of did. \"You\u0027ve just got to find the right things. And really, half of beauty is attitude. You feel sexy, then you are sexy.\"\\n\\n Maddie looked dubious. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s that easy. Guys aren\u0027t exactly chomping at the bit to ask me out. You know how long it\u0027s been since I was on a date?\"\\n\\n \"That goes back to attitude,\" I said. \"Look, I don\u0027t mean to sound harsh, but you don\u0027t always give off friendly vibes. I mean, you do to me. And to Doug. Sort of. But really, that\u0027s it.\"\\n\\n \"I know I\u0027m not the best with people,\" she admitted, crossing her arms over her chest. \"But I just can\u0027t do meaningless small talk.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but you still have to do some talking. It\u0027s a fact of life.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if guys came and actually talked to me, maybe I could try. But they aren\u0027t really lining up.\" She gestured at her body. \"Because of this. And now we\u0027ve come full circle.\"\\n\\n \"What if I could guarantee you a date?\" I asked, suddenly inspired.\\n\\n Her lips quirked into a smile. It instantly transformed her face. \"Are you asking me out?\"\\n\\n \"No, but someone else will, I\u0027m certain of it. You just have to let me pick out your outfit.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not wearing anything slutty.\"\\n\\n \"It won\u0027t be,\" I promised. I stood up from my chair. \"Look, I\u0027ve gotta run. Wear the yellow dress to the wedding. With a belt. I\u0027ll give you details later about the date plan.\" She left, looking skeptical, and I threw myself into work.\\n\\n The rest of the day flew by. I never saw Seth in the caf¨¦ and presumed he was working at home today. We had a date later on, so I knew I\u0027d see him then. Since becoming manager, I spent a lot of time holed up in my office, which was hard on the social part of me. But, every once in a while, I got to escape to cover someone\u0027s break or arrange a display.\\n\\n While near the self-help section, a guy carrying some books stumbled near me and dropped the stack. Hoping he hadn\u0027t tripped on a bump in the carpet and was planning a lawsuit, I hastily knelt down to help him.\\n\\n \"No, no,\" he said, cheeks burning. He was the age I looked, late twenties. Early thirties at most. \"You don\u0027t have to...\"\\n\\n I was already stacking them, though, and quickly understood his discomfort. They were books on all sorts of fetishes - in particular, exhibitionism and voyeurism.\\n\\n \"Oh God,\" he said, as I handed him the books. \"I\u0027m so embarrassed. I feel like such a pervert.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I told him. \"It\u0027s your business, and we\u0027ve all got our...ah, preferences.\"\\n\\n He looked mildly reassured but still clearly wanted to bolt. There was a wedding ring on his hand, and I expected I was dealing with a fetish he probably didn\u0027t share with his wife. Honestly, I was surprised he\u0027d resorted to actual books when he could find a hundred times more sources on the Internet. Most likely he and his wife shared a home computer, and he feared discovery.\\n\\n It was Georgina the succubus, not Georgina the bookstore manager, who asked the next question. Georgina the bookstore manager would have gotten fired for it if caught.\\n\\n \"You like the watching or the doing?\" I kept my voice low.\\n\\n He swallowed, studied me for mockery, and must have decided I was serious. \"The, um, doing.\"\\n\\n For half a breath, I considered going for it with him. I needed the energy, badly. He\u0027d be an easy mark, consumed with a secret obsession he couldn\u0027t fulfill anywhere else. But, it\u0027d mean doing it in this body, and I didn\u0027t like that. This was my preferred, everyday shape. I didn\u0027t want to sully it with business.\\n\\n So, I smiled and sent him on his way, silently wishing him well in fulfilling his sexual desires.\\n\\n I called Seth later while I was walking home from work to confirm our date. We were going to meet over at the Pacific Northwest Ballet to see The Nutcracker. While he appreciated the performing arts, getting him to go out while his book\u0027s ending loomed had been a Herculean task, and I still couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d agreed. He\u0027d only conceded after I\u0027d promised he could show up at the last possible minute.\\n\\n Only, we apparently had different definitions of \"last possible minute\" because when the lights went down, he still hadn\u0027t surfaced. The ballet started, and I craned my neck each time I heard one of the doors open. The chair beside me stayed empty, unfortunately. It was a sign of my agitation that I missed a lot of the performance and couldn\u0027t appreciate Clara\u0027s dream - a dream as vivid for her as mine had been for me. I loved the ballet. I\u0027d danced in a few shows over my lifetime and never got tired of watching graceful muscles and elaborate costumes.\\n\\n At intermission, I turned on my cell phone and saw that Seth had tried to call. I dialed him back without even listening to the voice message. When he answered, I said, \"Please tell me a crazy fan kidnapped you and broke your legs with a sledgehammer.\"\\n\\n \"Um, no. Didn\u0027t you get my message?\"\\n\\n \"Well, no, seeing as my phone said it came in a half-hour ago. I didn\u0027t have it on because I was busy watching this thing. You know, The Nutcracker?\"\\n\\n He sighed. \"I\u0027m sorry. I couldn\u0027t leave. I was too wrapped up. I thought if I, uh, gave you enough notice...\"\\n\\n \"Notice? This was more like a belated birthday card. Six months after the fact.\"\\n\\n Silence fell, and I felt some satisfaction in knowing he was quietly acknowledging his wrongdoing.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Thetis. It was...I shouldn\u0027t have done it, busy or not. I\u0027m really sorry. You know how I get.\"\\n\\n Now I sighed. He was so damned sincere and adorable that I had a hard time holding a grudge. This wasn\u0027t, however, the first time he\u0027d stood me up or otherwise neglected our social life. Sometimes I wondered if I allowed him too much indulgence. I spent so much time worrying about my transgressions taking advantage of him; maybe I was the one being walked over without even realizing it.\\n\\n \"You want to meet up after the show?\" I asked, trying not to sound mad. \"Cody invited me out to the bar with them. We could hang out there for a while.\"\\n\\n \"Um...well, no.\"\\n\\n \"No?\" The annoyance I\u0027d tried to quell shot its head back up again. \"I just forgave you for standing me up and wasting the money I paid on your ticket, and now you\u0027re turning down my conciliatory offer?\"\\n\\n \"Look...I really am sorry, but watching you and your friends get drunk isn\u0027t exactly appealing.\"\\n\\n I sat for a moment, too stunned to respond. He\u0027d spoken in his typically mild way, but I\u0027d heard the slightest bit of derision underscoring his words. Seth didn\u0027t drink. He always tolerated my excesses good-naturedly, but I suddenly wondered if they irritated him after all. His meaning came through as haughtiness to me.\\n\\n \"Sorry we\u0027re not up to your standards. God knows we can\u0027t expect you to do anything outside of your comfort zone.\"\\n\\n \"Please, stop. I don\u0027t want to fight with you,\" he said with exasperation. \"I\u0027m really, really, really sorry about all this. I didn\u0027t mean to stand you up. You know that.\"\\n\\n The lights flashed, signaling the end of intermission. \"I\u0027ve got to go.\"\\n\\n \"Will you...will you please come over tonight? Go out with your friends, let me finish, and then I\u0027ll make things up to you. I promise. I...I have an early Christmas present for you.\"\\n\\n The hesitancy in his voice softened my heart. A little. \"Yeah. Okay. It might be really late when I get there.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll wait up.\"\\n\\n We said our good-byes and disconnected. I watched the rest of the show in a grumpy mood and decided drinking and bitching with the gang couldn\u0027t come a moment too soon. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-4.html","bookId":2056,"book":{"id":2056,"title":"Succubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid #3)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 3: Succubus Dreams \\n especially when the girl in question is Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men.
