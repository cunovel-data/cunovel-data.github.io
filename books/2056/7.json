{"id":110250,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\"Get out,\" I said immediately. Yasmine and Vincent, finishing their breakfast at my table, looked up in surprise. Niphon gestured toward them. \"I was invited in. I didn\u0027t think it\u0027d be a problem.\" Angel and human looked distinctly uncomfortable, and I could guess what had happened. Niphon had turned up, and they\u0027d let him inside, not knowing about our animosity. They\u0027d probably figured he was a partner in evil which, in the most technical of ways, he was. Vincent hastily stood up and took his empty plate to the sink. Yasmine followed. \"Well,\" said Vincent. \"We should probably get going.\" \"Yeah,\" agreed Yasmine, grabbing her coat. Fools rushed in where angels feared to tread, apparently. \"Great seeing you guys.\" They left so fast that they might as well have teleported out. I fixed my attention back on Niphon. \"Get out,\" I repeated. He leaned back against my couch, draping his arms over the back of it. \"Letha, Letha - \" \"And stop calling me that.\" \"Whatever you like. And don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be out of your hair soon. I just wanted to give you a Tawny update.\" Oh God. Tawny. Please, please let her have scored last night, I silently begged. Her attitude at the bar hadn\u0027t really inspired confidence, but maybe me leaving with Jude had set a good example. \"She hasn\u0027t taken a victim yet.\" Damn. \"Alright, thanks,\" I said, pointing at the door. \"You can leave now. And next time, it\u0027s really okay if you call to give me an update. Preferably when you\u0027re in the taxi that\u0027s taking you to the airport so I don\u0027t ever have to fucking see you again.\" He rose from the couch, giving me a wounded look. \"Fine, fine. But there is one other thing I wanted to talk to you about.\" \"There is nothing at all I want to talk to you about.\" I was on the verge of growling. \"Oh, I\u0027m not so sure about that.\" His hand rested on the doorknob, but he showed no intention of actually leaving. \"I think you\u0027ll be very interested. It\u0027s about your love life.\" \"No! We are not talking about this.\" \"Le - Georgina, I just want to help you,\" he whined. \"I think it\u0027s terrible that you two can\u0027t fully express your love.\" \"We. Are. Fine. And don\u0027t lean against the door. I don\u0027t want your hair to leave an oil stain.\" Niphon straightened up and ran a solicitous hand over the back of his head. \"Look, I get why you don\u0027t want to sleep with him. It\u0027s admirable. You want to protect his lifespan, not wipe him out, etc., etc. But what if that wasn\u0027t an issue? What if I made it so that you could have sex without the dire side effects?\" \"Right. And you\u0027d do that out of the kindness of your heart.\" \"Well...\" He shrugged and spread his hands wide. \"There\u0027s always a price.\" \"It\u0027s not worth it. Not worth Seth selling his soul.\" \"I could sweeten the deal. Give him a longer lifespan...longer youth...\" \"No. I swear to God, if you don\u0027t leave now, I\u0027m calling Jerome.\" That was a bluff, seeing as Jerome was out of town. \"Like I said, just trying to help,\" Niphon said. \"Yeah, like you helped me?\" I asked, not bothering to hide the sarcasm. Suddenly, the mocking, teasing look vanished. Niphon\u0027s face grew hard. Angry. Scary. \"I did help you, Little Letha. You were no one. No one at all. Some poor fisherman\u0027s daughter in a shit, backwoods town. Some whore in a shit, backwoods town. You fucked up your life, and I fixed it for you. I made you who you are. Erased your problems. Saved your husband. Gave you eternal life and beauty. If anything, you owe me.\" \"It wasn\u0027t worth it,\" I said, in a voice that matched his dark expression. \"It wasn\u0027t worth it.\" \"Wasn\u0027t it? Would you have rather watched your husband commit suicide? Would you rather have died an outcast and disgraced?\" I didn\u0027t answer. I thought about the desperate look on my husband\u0027s face when he\u0027d found out that I\u0027d cheated on him. Even after all these centuries, that expression still haunted me. He\u0027d been driven to such despair that he\u0027d been on the verge of taking his own life. In selling my soul and becoming a succubus, I\u0027d struck a bargain with Hell that made him and everyone else I knew forget me. My husband had lived and gone on with his life, forgetting I\u0027d ever existed. Had it been worth it? Observing my silence, Niphon\u0027s face turned taunting once more. He opened the door. \"Good-bye, Georgina. Let me know if you change your mind.\" He left, and I stared at the door for a long time before finally forcing my feet to start moving. The Seth soul-selling offer held no temptation for me whatsoever. That didn\u0027t trouble me. But his other words...the reminders of my past... I sighed. I didn\u0027t want to deal with that, not with everything else going on in my life right now. And speaking of which...with two hours left until work, I decided to bite the bullet and again try to get more information about my dreams. From Dante. His store looked as bleak as the last time I\u0027d visited, but this time, he actually had a customer. She was a young woman, college-aged maybe, with layered brown hair and a gray sweatshirt. Seeing her, I started to step back outside, but he waved me in. \"No, no, it\u0027s okay. You can wait here.\" Dante glanced at the girl. Both of them sat at the shabby, velvet-covered table. \"You don\u0027t mind, do you?\" She barely spared me a glance. \"No! No! Hurry, go on. I want to hear more about the man.\" Dante produced a dazzling grin that seemed a bit fake to me but which I suspected was actually very effective on her. Taking a step closer, I realized he was reading her Tarot cards. Several already lay on the table. He flipped another over. \"Ah, the Hierophant.\" His voice held a mysterious, knowing note. \"What\u0027s that mean?\" she squealed. \"You don\u0027t know? You don\u0027t know anything about these?\" She shook her head. \"Nothing.\" \"Well, the Hierophant is a great love card. It represents a romantic man, someone good-looking and charming who loves giving gifts and doing small gestures. You know the kind.\" \"I don\u0027t, actually,\" she said wistfully. \"All my boyfriends have been jerks.\" \"Well, that\u0027s going to change,\" he promised. I knew quite a bit about Tarot cards, actually. The Hierophant represented tradition, wisdom, and organized religion. He wasn\u0027t exactly a romantic figure, particularly considering he was usually depicted as a priest. \"Why is he dressed so weird?\" asked the girl. \"He looks like he\u0027s in robes.\" \"It\u0027s not weird,\" Dante said. \"It\u0027s opulent. Remember, the Tarot is an ancient system. A guy dressed like this represented the height of fashion back in the old days. You know, a real designer label kind of guy.\" I caught Dante\u0027s gaze and rolled my eyes. He maintained his poker face and flipped the next card. \"Things are looking good,\" he declared. \"The Tower.\" The Tower was pretty much the worst card in the deck. \"This shows you guys have a promising future.\" \"Why is it on fire?\" she asked. \"And why are people falling out of the windows?\" \"It\u0027s all symbolic,\" he said hastily. \"And although things look really good for when you meet this guy, it means you have to be cautious and read the signs around you.\" \"Oh, wow,\" she said. \"I hope I can.\" Dante gathered up the cards and stacked them neatly. \"Well, I can help if you want. I could give you a package set of readings at a discount. That way, you\u0027ll have a guide as you go along. You\u0027ll be prepared for when you meet him.\" I sincerely doubted she was ever going to meet this mythical guy. \"How much?\" she asked hesitantly. \"Hmm, let\u0027s see.\" Dante turned speculative. \"Well, they\u0027re normally fifty dollars. Usually, I give a five-dollar discount for packages...but, hell. I really want to see this work. I\u0027m a romantic myself, you know? It\u0027s a stretch, but I\u0027ll do a set of six for forty dollars each. You can buy them now and then come in whenever you want to claim them.\" The girl deliberated, and I wanted to yell at her that it was a scam. But I needed Dante\u0027s advice and didn\u0027t want to get on his bad side. Not that I was necessarily on his good side right now. \"I don\u0027t want to pressure you,\" he told her gently. \"So, please. Don\u0027t feel obligated. Just do whatever your heart tells you to do. I mean, if the cards have told us anything, it\u0027s that you have to protect your heart now as you enter this important stage of your life.\" That sold her. \"Okay. I\u0027ll do it.\" I watched in disbelief as the two of them walked to his register. She handed over two-hundred-forty dollars - plus tax - and he gave her a Tarot punch card, not unlike what you\u0027d get at a coffee or sandwich shop. \"You should be ashamed of yourself,\" I told him when she was gone. \"Succubus. Nice to see you too.\" \"That wasn\u0027t a romance reading.\" \"Nope,\" he agreed, coming over to stand beside me. \"It actually suggested she\u0027d soon be having a sex change and joining a suicide cult.\" \"But you told her it was about love.\" \"She\u0027s twenty years old. Love\u0027s all they want to hear about at that age.\" \"You\u0027re going to Hell.\" \"I could have told you that. In fact, I did tell you that last time, didn\u0027t I? Now. What can I do for you? You change your mind about the sex?\" \"No. Of course not.\" He looked offended. \"Of course not? What\u0027s with the attitude? I\u0027m not that unappealing.\" \"No,\" I agreed. He looked like he still hadn\u0027t shaved in a couple days, and there was something very sexy about that and the way his indigo T-shirt fit him. I hadn\u0027t realized before what nice ab muscles he had. Probably the lack of business around here gave him lots of time to work out. \"But that\u0027s not why I\u0027m here. And honestly, if this behavior is just the tip of the iceberg, I\u0027m thinking your soul isn\u0027t going to be worth my time anyway.\" He threw his hands in the air. \"She comes and insults me, then expects help. So what is it you want? Your dishwasher finally break?\" \"No, but I had the dream again. And there was more.\" I recapped it, and he listened, face unreadable. \"You sure you don\u0027t want a new dishwasher?\" he asked dubiously. \"No!\" \"What about kids?\" \"What about them?\" \"You want them?\" I fell silent, and despite his lopsided smile, I could see Dante scrutinizing me. He might be a con artist, but he was smart. The best ones always are. People like him make their living reading people and exploiting little things - like that girl\u0027s longing for romance. \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" I said. \"You know that. I can\u0027t have them.\" \"I didn\u0027t ask that, succubus. I asked if you wanted them.\" I averted my eyes, studying the crystal ball. With the way the sunlight hit it, I suspected it was actually plastic. \"Sure. I did even when I was mortal. If I could have kids now, I would.\" He nodded, and for the first time, I got the impression he might almost be taking me seriously. Almost. \"And let me guess. You woke up without energy.\" \"Yes, and I\u0027d gotten a victim the night before. Just like last time.\" His face turned speculative. \"Interesting. It only happens when you\u0027re charged up.\" \"What do you think it means?\" \"Dunno. Might not mean anything.\" \"It has to! I\u0027m losing energy for no reason at all.\" \"You\u0027re stressed,\" he argued. \"And you\u0027re, like, one of the most uptight people I\u0027ve ever met - immortal or otherwise. You\u0027ve spent centuries wishing you could get knocked up. You have this celibate boyfriend thing going on. And you work for that demon, right? The one who looks like Matthew Broderick?\" \"John Cusack,\" I corrected. \"He looks like John Cusack.\" \"Whatever. That\u0027s enough to tax anybody. Your dreams are manifestations of the woes in your life, coming out of your subconscious in vivid, energy-sucking ways.\" \"You are so unhelpful. Your dream expertise is a scam - like everything else.\" \"Nah. Not everything I do is a scam. I know dreams. I know spells. And I know what could help you.\" \"What?\" He pointed to the counter. \"You and me. Up there. Naked. Horizontal.\" I groaned. \"Wow, you really weren\u0027t lying. You are a romantic.\" \"A pragmatist. And an opportunist.\" \"A sleazy guy, treating me like a cheap whore...\" \"Fuck, I haven\u0027t been laid in months, and now this succubus shows up wanting my help. You\u0027d try to bargain for sex too.\" I eyed him warily. \"Is that what this is about? I have to sleep with you to get help?\" Dante shoved his hands in his pockets. \"Nope. You\u0027d be more fun if you were willing, I think. Besides, I have no other help to give.\" Disappointed, I made motions to leave. \"Okay. Thanks. Sort of.\" \"You know what else might help?\" he called after me. \"If it involves sex - \" \"A vacation. At the very least, a massage. Basic stress reliever things.\" Those were actually reasonable things, and I was pleasantly surprised to see his mind wasn\u0027t always in the gutter. \"They can help,\" I told him. \"But I doubt a massage will fix the problems in my life.\" \"Maybe. Maybe not. But if you want a free one...a naked free one...\" I left. I\u0027d already felt like my romance with Seth was some infinite loop tape reel. The rest of my life apparently was too. Have the same dream, go to Dante, get no help, go to work, and ruminate. Because that\u0027s exactly how my day was unfolding, just like before. I went through the motions of paperwork and customer service at Emerald City, all the while consumed by images of the little girl in the dream and the sweet fantasy of having a daughter. My heart ached to see her again, to see that smile. Everything at my job seemed so shallow and meaningless compared with her. When work ended, I brought Maddie back to my apartment to make good on my promise to get her a date. \"You\u0027re going to sell me?\" she exclaimed when I told her the plan. \"It\u0027s an auction,\" I said. \"For a children\u0027s charity. You don\u0027t hate kids, do you?\" \"Well, no, but - \" \"Then this\u0027ll be great. Here, try this on.\" I tossed her a BCBG shopping bag. She eyed it warily. \"Isn\u0027t that a place for teenagers?\" \"It\u0027s a place for anybody with style,\" I assured her. She opened the bag and pulled out the knee-length dress I\u0027d picked up for her the other day. It was silk chiffon with a dark pink geometric print. The empire waist had a slightly gathered top, and the V-neck had a bow that tied underneath it. Fluttery cap sleeves finished it off. \"I can\u0027t wear this,\" she said immediately. \"Why? Because it\u0027ll look good?\" She shot me a glare. \"There\u0027s hardly anything there.\" \"What? There\u0027s plenty.\" I owned lots of dresses that had \"hardly anything there.\" This was elegant and tasteful. Amish country compared to some of my clothing. \"Try it on, and we\u0027ll see.\" She did, reluctantly, and I could have crowed with delight when she stepped out of my bathroom. I\u0027d totally nailed the size. It fit perfectly. \"There isn\u0027t an extra inch here,\" she fretted, pulling at the fabric around the waist. \"Exactly.\" \"Doesn\u0027t it make me look fat?\" \"It makes you look great. If it were spandex or something, there might be a problem, but this is light and drapey.\" \"The neckline\u0027s awfully low - \" \"Oh, be quiet,\" I snapped. \"And let\u0027s finish the rest of you.\" I did her makeup and arranged her hair down for a change. It shone like black silk when brushed out, and I thought it was a shame she wore it in a haphazard ponytail so often. Besides, everyone knows that in the movies, shy girls always become beautiful by letting down their hair and taking off their glasses. Maddie already wore contacts, but the principle was still sound. I finally finished her off with half-heeled shoes I\u0027d bought to match the dress. Higher ones would have looked better, but even I knew when not to press my luck. Satisfied with the results, we headed out to the auction. \"You\u0027re like my fairy godmother,\" she muttered as we walked into the hotel the event was being held at. \"But I\u0027m still a pumpkin.\" I elbowed her. \"How did you get so negative? You should start some angstful emo rock band to compete with Doug\u0027s.\" \"Oh, yeah. That\u0027d go over - hey, is that Seth?\" We were cutting across the open room the auction would take place in, heading toward the volunteers\u0027 area. Lots of people had gathered, filling most of the round tables facing the stage. I followed her gesture to where Seth sat at one of the few tables that wasn\u0027t already full. Seeing us notice him, he held up his hand in greeting. \"He wanted to come support you,\" I told her. Actually, Seth had been appalled at me strong-arming Maddie into this and had attended mainly out of a perverse fascination at what he thought might end in disaster. But Maddie, not knowing his motives, was pleasantly surprised. She smiled, and I nearly swooned. \"That,\" I said. \"That right there is what you need to do.\" The smile dropped. \"That what?\" Hugh practically skipped over when he saw us. \"I knew you didn\u0027t hate kids. I knew you\u0027d cave and come help - \" \"Not me,\" I said. \"Maddie.\" I rested a hand on her shoulder. Hugh\u0027s face turned perfectly blank. \"Oh?\" Just then, a tall brunette in a black satin evening dress strolled over. The \"fucking fox,\" presumably. She extended her hand. \"Hello, I\u0027m Deanna, the coordinator. You must be Hugh\u0027s friend?\" \"Georgina,\" I said, shaking. \"But Maddie here is your volunteer. She\u0027s a journalist for an important women\u0027s magazine.\" Deanna\u0027s eyes lit up. \"Ah! We love celebrities. Let me take down your information.\" She led Maddie away. As soon as they were gone, Hugh turned on me. \"What the hell? I wanted Georgina, and you give me Georgy Girl.\" \"You are such an asshole. That\u0027s a horrible thing to say.\" He shrugged, eyes on Maddie. \"I call \u0027em like I see \u0027em. She\u0027s huge.\" My eyes were on Maddie too. She actually looked quite slim in the dress, but Hugh was one of those guys who liked bony types - so long as their chests were big enough. \"You\u0027re the reason women have such horrible self-esteem issues. You tear them apart. Women, I mean. Not the issues.\" \"Look, I\u0027m sure she\u0027s not all bad,\" he said. \"She probably gives good head.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Flatterer. Why do you say that?\" \"Fat girls always do. They have to. Only way they can get men.\" I punched him in the arm. Hard. \"Ow! Fuck, that hurt.\" \"You\u0027re a jerk,\" I told him. \"Maddie\u0027s beautiful.\" \"She\u0027s okay,\" he said, rubbing his injured arm. \"And I can\u0027t exactly have just okay tonight - not with that liability already on deck.\" He pointed over to where some of the other volunteers waited. Immediately, I found what he referred to. It was easy because Tawny towered over the other women by about a foot. \"Holy Christ,\" I said. \"How did that happen?\" He threw up his hands, looking miserable. \"She latched on to the idea when you mentioned it at the bar.\" \"I didn\u0027t even think she heard me,\" I said apologetically. Hugh waved me toward the crowd. \"Too late now. Go have a seat, Brutus, so this disaster can get under way. You\u0027ve ruined the night. I don\u0027t know why you hate kids so much.\" I gave him a parting glare and went off to find Seth. The vampires had joined him since I\u0027d come in. \"You guys here to get a date or a victim?\" I asked. \"Neither,\" said Peter. \"We\u0027re here to see the Tawny Show.\" I sighed. \"This is supposed to be a charity event, and people are treating it like a freak show. Hugh already accused me of ruining it by bringing Maddie.\" Seth looked surprised. \"Why? She looks great.\" I pointed her out to Peter and Cody, who also concurred about her cuteness. \"She\u0027ll be fine,\" said Cody. \"Tawny\u0027s going to be the one to watch. I haven\u0027t really been able to see what she\u0027s wearing. I hope it\u0027s up to her usual standards.\" \"Maybe her Secret Santa will get her some nicer clothes,\" said Peter. He glanced at me. \"You bought for yours yet?\" \"Huh?\" Right. Carter. I\u0027d completely forgotten. Buying something for that cynical angel hadn\u0027t exactly been at the top of my priority list. \"I, um, have some ideas. Still thinking about it.\" \"What about a Christmas tree? You got one of those?\" \"Um, haven\u0027t done that either.\" \"I didn\u0027t know you wanted a Christmas tree,\" said Seth. \"Do you need help picking one out?\" \"Well, I don - \" The auction started, cutting me off. The auctioneer, Nick, was a young guy in his early thirties who probably had a second job doing minor modeling contracts that would never actually get him out of Seattle. He smiled non-stop and did a good job flirting with the women and making guy-jokes to the men. Bids flew fast and furious, and it was easy to get caught up in the excitement. \"Next up,\" said the auctioneer, reading from a card, \"is Tawny Johnson.\" \"Johnson?\" asked Cody. \"Kind of boring.\" \"She made up both her names,\" I said. Succubi often did. \"She probably didn\u0027t have any mental energy left after choosing the first one.\" \"Ouch,\" said Seth. \"Who\u0027s being mean now?\" \"You haven\u0027t met her,\" I warned. Tawny pranced up, wearing seven-inch high-heeled shoes that appeared to be made out of stainless steel. They looked like medieval torture devices but matched her super-tight, silver lam¨¦ hot pants and jacket. \"She didn\u0027t disappoint,\" said Cody, studying the outfit. Unsurprisingly, she stumbled the last couple of steps, and Nick reached out to steady her. \"Careful there,\" he said, flashing his brilliant white teeth. \"Men are supposed to fall all over you.\" It took her a moment to get the joke, and then she burst into small, high-pitched giggles. The noise grated on my nerves, but Nick seemed quite pleased to have someone appreciate his jokes. \"Why don\u0027t you tell us a little bit about yourself, Tawny,\" he said. \"It says here you\u0027re currently unemployed. Does that mean you\u0027re out looking for something right now?\" \"Well, Nick, I\u0027m out looking for someone right now - if you know what I mean.\" \"Oh my God,\" I said. \"That was kind of funny,\" Peter noted. \"No, it wasn\u0027t.\" Nick apparently agreed with Peter. He threw back his head and laughed. \"Careful there, guys...we got a dangerous one on our hands. Tell me, Tawny, what is it you\u0027re looking for in a man?\" She pursed her red-lacquered lips in deep thought. \"I\u0027m looking for heart, Nick. Heart and soul. Those are the most important things.\" There was a collective \"aww\" from the audience. Beside me, Peter said, \"Okay, the soul thing really was funny. Only to us, of course, but still.\" Tawny then winked at the crowd. \"But stamina and a big checkbook can make up for that sometimes.\" Nick waited for the audience\u0027s laughter to fade. \"Okay, let\u0027s start the bidding at fifty - oh my God.\" Tawny had taken off her jacket, revealing a zebra-print bandeau top underneath. \u0027Top\u0027 was a dubious term at best, though. When wrapped around her enormous bust, it looked more like a rubber band and really only served to cover her nipples. Bids exploded from the audience, much to the astonishment of my friends and me. More surprising still was when Nick the auctioneer actually joined in. \"Folks, I know this is a bit unusual...but, well, I just can\u0027t help myself. Three-hundred dollars.\" \"Three-fifty!\" \"Four-hundred!\" In the end, Nick was the one who ended up winning her, paying a startling five-fifty. \"Well, I\u0027ll be damned,\" said Peter. I would have made a joke about his comment if I wasn\u0027t so shocked. When I finally found my voice, it was to say, \"Well...this is a good thing, right? That guy looks like he\u0027d sleep with her right now.\" \"And,\" added Cody, \"it was all for the kids.\" Slowly, my astonishment faded into relief. This was an unexpected twist to the evening. The Tawny problem was fixed. Apparently, all we\u0027d needed to do was essentially run an ad for her. She\u0027d sleep with him, and Niphon would get off my back. One less thing for me to worry about - which was good, because I certainly had plenty of other things. Like Maddie. It was her turn next. She walked out, face grim and set for battle. She looked both terrified and terrifying. In spite of that hard countenance, I still saw a few interested faces in the audience. \"Smile, smile,\" I muttered to no one in particular. \"Maddie Sato,\" said Nick cheerily. \"You write magazine articles. Anything I\u0027d know?\" \"Probably not,\" she said, still wearing that grimace. \"Not unless you read feminist publications.\" \"Feminist,\" he said, clearly amused. \"Next you\u0027ll be telling us you hate men.\" She gave him a blank look. \"I only hate stupid men who don\u0027t actually understand what \u0027feminist\u0027 means.\" He laughed. \"You run into a lot of men like that?\" \"All the time.\" \"Really?\" \"Even as we speak, Nick.\" \"Oh no she didn\u0027t,\" said Peter. I groaned. It took Nick a full ten seconds to realize he had just been insulted. Then, for the first time that night, he stopped smiling. Turning to the crowd, he said flatly, \"Okay, let\u0027s start the bidding at fifty.\" Silence met him. The interested faces no longer looked so interested. I swallowed a scream. No, this couldn\u0027t be happening. I\u0027d promised her a date. This would destroy her. After what seemed like an eternity, I heard a voice in the back of the room. \"Fifty.\" Relieved, I craned my head and looked. The guy who had bid was about fifty years old and looked exactly like this pedophile I\u0027d once seen on a news special. \"Fifty,\" said Nick. \"Do I hear seventy-five?\" Silence. I turned to Seth. \"Do something!\" I hissed. He flinched. \"What?\" \"Going once...\" I elbowed him, and his hand shot up. \"Seventy-five.\" There was a collective \"ooh\u0027 in the room. Apparently no one, including Maddie, had expected a bidding war for the belligerent man-hater. Her eyes widened in surprise. \"One hundred,\" said the pedophile look-alike. Then, either to end this quickly or because he felt sorry for Maddie, Seth said, \"Three hundred.\" More sounds of astonishment followed. The other bidder couldn\u0027t compete; he must have spent all his money on bail. \"Sold to the gentleman in the Welcome Back, Kotter T-shirt.\" \"Nice,\" said Cody, as Maddie exited the stage. I reached out and squeezed Seth\u0027s hand. \"Thank you.\" He gave me his half-smile. \"Anything for the kids.\" Nick flipped to his next card. \"And now we have...Georgina Kincaid.\" My head shot up. Across the room, I saw Hugh\u0027s smirking face. \"Oh no he didn\u0027t,\" I said through gritted teeth. Nick, puzzled, glanced toward where the other auctionees were. \"Georgina Kincaid?\" \"No avoiding it,\" Peter told me. \"Might as well go up there. Otherwise people\u0027ll think you hate kids.\" \"That joke is getting old,\" I hissed. Vowing to slap Hugh later, I reluctantly rose from my chair. Upon seeing me, Nick turned on the supernova smile. \"Ah, there she is. Fashionably late.\" On the subject of fashion, I wished I\u0027d worn something as nice as Maddie\u0027s dress. I might have just gotten tricked into this thing, but now I wished I could do it right. I still looked good; my normal sense of aesthetics would allow for nothing less. I had on a black skirt and a purple cashmere sweater, my hair in a ponytail. In tiny increments - too slow and small for anyone to notice - I tightened the sweater around my figure and made the neckline bigger. I put a saunter into my hips and pulled out my ponytail tie, shaking out my hair. It had worked for Maddie and countless nerdy movie girls. It would work for me because I suddenly had a serious issue at stake here. There was no way on God\u0027s green earth that I was going for less than Tawny. \"Georgina,\" said Nick, helping me onto the stage. \"My notes say you prefer Georgie.\" Yeah, Hugh was definitely getting slapped. \"And that you run a bookstore.\" If I\u0027d taken a victim recently and had succubus glamour on me, I wouldn\u0027t have to do a single thing except stand there. I wouldn\u0027t even have to smile. Now I\u0027d have to work a little. Quickly, I assessed this crowd. The kinds of guys who came to events like this tended to be white-collar professionals with disposable income. Some would be here simply because philanthropy was trendy and good for the image, and this was a stylish way to do it. Others, while perhaps not desperate, were nonetheless intellects and introverts who found this a good opportunity to meet women. These men all wanted smart, competent women - women who were also pretty, of course. And wit...wit always went over well. I gave Nick, then the audience, a heart-stopping smile. \"That\u0027s right. I organize events, bring in money, make sure everything looks good, and whip people into shape.\" \"Sounds like a lot of work,\" he said. \"Or,\" I said, \"an excellent first date.\" There was no cymbal crash, but my punch line elicited the laughs I\u0027d hoped for. \"You have some high expectations,\" said Nick. \"Well, I think everyone should. Why settle? If a guy meets my expectations, I\u0027ll meet his. And in the end, it\u0027s all about sense of humor and a conversation that won\u0027t put me to sleep.\" I realized I sounded vaguely like a Miss America contestant, but maybe there wasn\u0027t much difference. I could see from the intrigue in the audience that I\u0027d made a good impression. \"This one\u0027s a keeper,\" said Nick. \"Let\u0027s start at fifty for Georgie.\" I got my fifty and then some. Bids flew around the room. At one point, I glanced at Seth. Our eyes met, and I could tell by his expression that he was on the verge of bidding. I shook my head. He was the only one I wanted to go out with in this room, but I didn\u0027t want to taint Maddie\u0027s win. I wanted her to feel special. Besides, I also didn\u0027t want Seth to blow that much money. I went for seventeen-hundred dollars. \"I can\u0027t believe that,\" Maddie whispered to me afterward. \"I think you\u0027re the highest one so far. The guy looked cute too.\" He had. Late thirties. Armani suit. Harmless. Nobody I planned on establishing anything meaningful with, but he\u0027d do for a casual date. Maybe an energy fix if I decided to use this body. \"You brought in some money yourself,\" I teased. Her eyes found Seth, sitting across the room, and studied him speculatively. \"Seth probably did it because he felt sorry for me.\" \"Of course not,\" I said quickly. She still looked skeptical. \"Well, it doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027d rather drink coffee and talk shop with him than go out with some sleazy guy. That other bidder reminded me of this sex offender I saw on TV once...\" When the auction wound down, I exchanged contact info with my buyer for a future date. Hugh attached himself to Deanna and stayed as far away from me as possible. No worries. I\u0027d have plenty of time to deal with him later. Tawny, fortunately, also stayed away from me and clung to Nick\u0027s arm. I watched them like a proud parent. Tonight was going to be a great night.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-7.html","bookId":2056,"book":{"id":2056,"title":"Succubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid #3)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 3: Succubus Dreams especially when the girl in question is Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men.
