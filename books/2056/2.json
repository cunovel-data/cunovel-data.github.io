{"id":110245,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"For a few seconds, I was no longer at the party. My mind\u0027s eye flashed back to where I stood on a cliff outside the town I\u0027d grown up in, barely old enough to be called an adult by today\u0027s standards. And Niphon was there, smiling at me, promising me he had all the answers and could make my problems disappear.... I shook my head, driving off the memories and returning to the party at hand. His smile grew, an evil smile that promised even more evil things. I could have been facing Eden\u0027s serpent himself. \"I knew you had it in you,\" he continued, stepping toward me. His voice stayed soft. \"I knew it the minute I saw you. I can\u0027t wait to find out firsthand just how...experienced you\u0027ve become.\" My defenses snapped into place, and I stepped back. \"Touch me, and I\u0027ll break your fucking neck.\" \"Such ingratitude, considering I made you what you are.\" \"Stay away from me.\" He started to move forward again, and my heart leapt to a pace that would have killed most humans. Suddenly, Jerome\u0027s voice fell over us, and I realized the room had become silent. \"Leave her alone, Niphon. She said no.\" The imp paused and made a pleading face. \"Aw, come on, Jerome. What kind of demon doesn\u0027t share his goods?\" \"You aren\u0027t here to fuck my succubus. If you can\u0027t do your job, I can replace you.\" Jerome\u0027s voice held a warning note that even an asshole like Niphon couldn\u0027t ignore. Maybe someone would be consigned to Hell tonight after all. Disappointingly, the imp inclined his head in obeisance and backed off. The look he gave me warned we would have a later conversation. I walked over to Jerome. \"Maybe you should have given me a heads up earlier.\" \"And ruin things for you lovebirds? Hardly something a die-hard romantic like me could do. Besides, I told you to come early.\" Hugh snapped his cell phone shut and wandered over to join us. He kissed my cheek. \"Hey, sweetie. Big things going on here.\" My already enormous sense of dread grew by leaps and bounds. \"Such as?\" \"Re-org. Seattle\u0027s lines have been redrawn. We\u0027re getting another succubus. Or, well, we\u0027ve got one.\" My jaw dropped, and I replayed Niphon\u0027s earlier words. \"You are so joking.\" \"Afraid not. This is Tawny.\" Robo-Blonde pranced over on her stiletto heels and tried to shake my hand again. I kept it out of reach, fearing for my bones. I forced a smile. \"Hi, Tawny.\" I turned back to Jerome and jerked my head at Niphon. \"Why is he here then?\" \"I acquired her,\" the imp explained. \"Acquired\" was a nice way of saying he\u0027d bought her soul for Hell, just as he\u0027d purchased mine. \"It\u0027s my job to stay and watch her until she\u0027s settled in and taken her first victim.\" \"No one ever did that for me,\" I recalled. \"You sort of threw me to the wolves.\" I\u0027d had to be some innkeeper\u0027s sex toy in Constantinople for a few years until I\u0027d learned the succubus ropes. Niphon shrugged. \"HR\u0027s new policy. Just think of all the time it\u0027ll give us to catch up.\" Giving Tawny a sidelong glance, I hoped her adamant desire to destroy men everywhere meant she\u0027d be a quick study. Eyeing her leopard-skin skirt, I had my doubts. \"Well. Fantastic. Now that I\u0027m up to speed, I guess there\u0027s no need to stay - \" Hugh shook his head, suddenly becoming my-friend-the-imp as opposed to the all-business imp. I could tell from his expression that I wouldn\u0027t like what he had to say next. \"There\u0027s something else you need to know. For the next year or so, you have to be her...uh, mentor.\" \"Mentor,\" I repeated flatly. He nodded, looking sympathetic. Jerome watched our exchange with amusement. \"What, um, does that mean for me exactly?\" Hugh set his briefcase on a coffee table and pulled out what looked like the kind of copied-and-bound manual Kinko\u0027s would run off. He tossed it to me. I caught it and nearly keeled over. The thing had about eight-hundred pages. Mentor\u0027s Official and Complete Procedural Handbook on Initial Succubus Intake and Probationary Period (Abridged). \"Abridged?\" I spun toward Jerome. \"Tell me you\u0027re getting back at me for the time I accused you of wearing Old Spice.\" \"That one\u0027s still coming,\" said the demon. \"This one\u0027s for real.\" \"I can\u0027t do this, Jerome. I don\u0027t have the time! Do you know how much stuff I\u0027ve got going on? I\u0027m still training the new assistant manager at work - \" He stood up with speed a vampire might have admired. He leaned toward me, the amusement gone from his face. \"Oh gee, Georgie. How inconsiderate of me to take you away from your human boyfriend and your crucial-to-the-world bookstore job and all the other fucking absurdity in your life! Let me just go ahead and tell my superiors that you\u0027ve got more important things to do than answer to the powers who control your immortal soul and could wipe out your existence in the blink of an eye.\" Heat flooded my cheeks. I didn\u0027t really appreciate being verbally bitch-slapped in front of Niphon and Seattle\u0027s entire dream team of evil. \"I didn\u0027t mean it like that. I just - \" \"It\u0027s not up for debate any longer.\" His words crawled over my skin. I swallowed. \"Yes, Jerome.\" Even I knew when to back down. Silence fell. A smirk played over Niphon\u0027s face. \"A human boyfriend. How terribly quaint. I can\u0027t wait to hear all about it.\" \"I think it\u0027s cute,\" said Tawny. \"I hope you\u0027re making him suffer.\" \"Their romance is a great tale of self-exploration,\" remarked Hugh, straight-faced. I shot him a glare. As a sexual workaround, Seth and I found we could do unto ourselves what we couldn\u0027t do to each other. I\u0027d never actually told my friends about this solution, but they\u0027d kind of figured it out. With the drama complete, the rest of the room lost interest in me. Tawny did not, however, and immediately began talking to me about the joys of ripping out men\u0027s hearts and watching them cry. I left her as quickly as I could, working the room and talking to those I hadn\u0027t seen in a while. I was good at smiling and making people laugh while all the while, my mind spun and processed this new complication. When I finally found Cody, Peter, and Hugh huddled in a corner, I breathed a sigh of relief. I could tell from the looks on their faces that this was the most hilarious thing they\u0027d seen in a while. Cody, young for a vampire but ancient compared to Tawny, threw an arm around me. His shaggy blond hair was tamed into a short stub of a ponytail. He was perpetually laidback and upbeat, and his \"youth\" always made the rest of us want to baby him. \"Oh, man. This is going to be great. You are so screwed.\" \"As if,\" I said, squirming away. \"You think I\u0027m afraid of her?\" \"I am,\" said Peter with a shiver. He had thinning brown hair and wore casual yet exquisitely coordinated clothes, all the way down to his argyle socks. He was an old vampire, close to my age, and was Cody\u0027s mentor. I\u0027d never thought much about their mentor-apprentice relationship before. It always seemed pretty effortless, but then, Cody was no Tawny. I followed Peter\u0027s gaze to where the new succubus animatedly told a story to a stone-faced demoness named Grace. From the dangerous jiggling of Tawny\u0027s breasts, it looked as though the structural integrity of her shirt could only last so long. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re afraid,\" said Hugh slyly. \"I think you\u0027re jealous.\" \"Of what exactly? Bad fashion sense? An ergonomically unsound bustline? I have nothing to be jealous of.\" \"Whatever. I saw your face when you heard we were getting a new succubus. Looks like someone isn\u0027t going to be the only girl in our little clique anymore.\" \"So?\" \"So, we\u0027ll have a new little sister to fawn and fret over. You\u0027ll have to share the spotlight.\" \"I\u0027m not sharing anything,\" I said huffily. Peter laughed. \"So it does bother you. Can\u0027t wait until the fur starts flying.\" \"Her fate is in your hands,\" said Cody. \"You should make her call you \u0027Miss Georgina,\u0027\" added Hugh with a mocking southern drawl. \"Or at least \u0027ma\u0027am.\u0027\" Niphon\u0027s presence and Jerome\u0027s lecture had put me in a grouchy mood. \"I\u0027m not doing any mentoring. She\u0027s so gungho to take on the world\u0027s male population, she doesn\u0027t even need me.\" The three men exchanged more smirks. Cody made some hissing and meowing sounds, scratching at the air. \"This isn\u0027t funny,\" I said. \"Sure it is,\" said Cody. \"Besides, don\u0027t you want to help others? Where\u0027s your sense of goodness and charity?\" \"I think I cashed that in when I, you know, sold my soul to Hell.\" Peter waved his hand. \"Details, details. \u0027Tis the season to put aside petty rivalries and animosity. You\u0027ve got to get into the holiday spirit. You probably haven\u0027t even put up your Christmas tree yet.\" \"I\u0027m not getting a tree this year.\" The smile slipped from Peter\u0027s face. \"What?\" \"Oh, shit. You\u0027ve done it now,\" said Hugh. \"I already got lectured earlier for not having one.\" \"You\u0027re a Scrooge,\" Peter told him while still looking at me. \"No one expects that kind of festive cheer from you. But Georgina...didn\u0027t you have a Christmas tree last year?\" \"Yeah. Somebody burned it down. At my Christmas Eve Martini Party.\" \"I was there,\" said Peter. \"I don\u0027t remember that.\" \"You were drunk. You\u0027d already passed out.\" \"What kind of sick bastard burns down a Christmas tree?\" Hugh and I exchanged glances. \"That\u0027s an excellent question,\" I said dryly. Peter looked startled. \"Was it you?\" he asked Hugh. \"No,\" said the imp. \"It was Carter.\" \"Your Christmas tree was burned down by an angel?\" asked Cody. He hadn\u0027t been with our group last December, so this was all new to him. And Peter too, apparently. \"Yup. The irony isn\u0027t lost on me,\" I said. \"He had his ashtray too close to where a branch was hanging down.\" \"Well, I think he did you a favor,\" said Hugh. \"You can get a fake one now. They\u0027re easier. No watering. No woodland animals. Besides, you can get them to match your d¨¦cor. Did you notice Peter\u0027s is \u0027pissed-off ocean green\u0027?\" Peter sighed. \"It\u0027s \u0027jaded sea green.\u0027\" I followed their gazes to Peter\u0027s monstrosity of a Christmas tree. Nine feet of perfectly shaped needles draped in gold tinsel and red glass ornaments. Everything on it coordinated. In fact, I suddenly realized, it matched Peter\u0027s outfit. The tree looked like a display model from a department store. The green in the multicolored bejeweled star on top even seemed to bring out the blue in the \u0027jaded sea green.\u0027 \"At least you don\u0027t have an angel on top,\" I said. \"Because that would have been kind of wrong. And possibly a fire hazard.\" \"Joke all you want,\" the vampire said, \"but you have to have a Christmas tree. Oh, yeah - you also have to draw a name for Secret Santas.\" I groaned. \"Are we doing that again?\" \"Let me go get the cup,\" he said, trotting to the other side of the kitchen. I looked at the other two. \"A vampire obsessed with Christmas. That has to be the weirdest thing I\u0027ve ever heard.\" \"No weirder than an angel burning down a Christmas tree,\" pointed out Cody. Peter returned with a reindeer mug that held a few folded pieces of paper. He held it out to me. \"Not many left. Pick.\" I pulled out a slip and opened it. Carter. \"Son of a bitch,\" I swore. \"I hate Christmas.\" \"You do not,\" said Peter. \"You just have to get a tree. Then you\u0027ll feel better.\" My eyes drifted from the star, down to Tawny and Niphon. \"What I have to do is get out of here,\" I told them, setting my glass on the counter. I made my good-byes to them and endured a bit more teasing about my new mentoring job. As I walked to the door, I overheard Jerome saying to Grace, \"...but I\u0027ll be out of town for a few days.\" I suddenly realized I needed to ask him something. \"Hey, Jerome.\" He turned from the demoness, shooting me an impatient look. In as few words as possible, I recapped how I\u0027d woken up without the energy I\u0027d stolen the previous night. Jerome listened, looking bored. \"What\u0027d you do last night? Bursts of shape-shifting? Rocket science? Heavy lifting?\" I didn\u0027t need him to tell me what sorts of things would burn through my energy. \"I didn\u0027t do any of those things. I just slept. I did dream, though.\" \"Dreams only suck the life out of humans, not us,\" he remarked dryly. \"It\u0027s what keeps Hell in business.\" Seeing my expression, he sighed. \"It\u0027s probably nothing, Georgie. Mental exhaustion\u0027ll do it. You probably spent the whole night unconsciously wrestling with sexual temptation.\" I didn\u0027t appreciate his flippant answer, but there was nothing I could do about it. I left the party, driving home at a reasonable speed limit this time. As soon as I cleared the door, I tossed that ridiculous manual to the floor. It landed with a ground-shaking thump that made my cat Aubrey puff up her tail. \"Sorry,\" I mumbled, scratching her black-speckled head in consolation. Traipsing to the bedroom, I promptly dialed Seth on my cell phone. \"Hey,\" he said. \"Hey. You have to come over here tonight.\" A pause. \"Well, I could, but...\" \"Oh, come on! You won\u0027t believe what I just went through. We\u0027re getting another succubus.\" He paused again. \"I\u0027m not really sure how to respond to that.\" \"Respond by getting your ass over here. I need you.\" \"Thetis...I\u0027m so close to the end here. Four chapters away. And I got this idea while we were having breakfast...\" I groaned. Cady and O\u0027Neill had defeated me again. Before actually meeting Seth, I\u0027d worshipped him from afar as a literary genius, reading his novels over and over. Now I knew the dark truth about being a bestselling author\u0027s girlfriend. Hearing my silence, he reluctantly added: \"But, I mean, if you really need me...\" \"No, no. Don\u0027t worry about it. It\u0027s okay.\" \"You don\u0027t sound like it\u0027s okay. I know how women work. You say that, then you\u0027ll hold a grudge against me forever. Literally.\" \"No, really. It\u0027s fine. I\u0027ll be seeing you tomorrow anyway. Besides, as soon as I get out of this dress, I\u0027m just going to pass out anyway.\" No way was I starting that procedural tome. \"You\u0027re wearing a dress?\" \"Yup.\" \"You weren\u0027t wearing one earlier. What\u0027s it look like?\" I started laughing. \"Ooh...are you trying to have phone sex with me?\" \"Phone sex? Hardly. We haven\u0027t even had a phone first date.\" \"It\u0027s not that hard. You see, I tell you how the dress has a really low neckline with nothing underneath. Then, you tell me how you\u0027ll reach out and peel it off and stroke my - \" \"Oh my God. No. We are not doing this.\" Typical Seth. He could write sex scenes that set the page on fire or dialogue clever enough to impress even me. Make him vocalize any of it, and he choked up. He was shy around others, fearful in large groups, and much happier staying an unnoticed listener. I sympathized but sometimes had trouble really comprehending it, considering how often I became the center of attention. I liked to think he\u0027d improved a bit since we got together, but he had a long way to go. \"It just takes practice. Here, I\u0027ll help you. Picture it. I\u0027m getting on my knees and slowly unfastening your pants - \" \"Okay, look. If you really want to go through with this, I\u0027d be happy to, you know, go get on my computer and IM it...\" \"Oh good grief. Go work on your book.\" I hung up the phone and sat down on my bed. Good Lord. My weekend had taken an abrupt U-turn. Like it or not, I supposed it had been only a matter of time before a new succubus joined the ranks here. Seattle had grown significantly over the years, and I could only do so much. But a green succubus? One I had to train up? If I hadn\u0027t known such administrative decisions were out of the demon\u0027s hands, I would have accused Jerome of doing it on purpose. It was on par with his sense of humor. Why couldn\u0027t we have just gotten some antisocial pro who did her job without ever interacting with me? And Niphon...well, that was the coup de gras. I didn\u0027t like being reminded of my past, and I didn\u0027t like him. Something told me he had it in for me, though I couldn\u0027t entirely fathom why. He\u0027d bought my soul and recruited my eternal services. What more was there? Wait and see, a warning voice whispered in my head. I shivered. Tawny couldn\u0027t make her first score a moment too soon. Suddenly, I didn\u0027t feel like passing out after all. I wanted to go out. Not for a victim or anything...just to, well, be out. Grab a drink. Do a little flirting. It might salvage the train wreck I\u0027d just endured. I headed downtown to the Cellar, a favorite watering hole for local immortals. After Tawny\u0027s coming-out party tonight, I doubted anyone I knew would be there. A little alone time suited me just fine. Yet, as I entered the crowded bar and slipped through the drinking, laughing patrons, I felt a cool sensation tickle my immortal senses. It made me think of crystal and ozone. Scanning around, I finally found Carter sitting across the room at a round table. Seattle\u0027s most powerful angel - and the one who had burned down my Christmas tree - had sensed me too, and a slight smile curled his lips in greeting. Although he naturally hadn\u0027t been at Hell\u0027s all staff meeting, he did have a tendency to hang out with my little clique. It had weirded me out at first, but I\u0027d since come to view him as a normal fixture in my life, albeit a strange and badly dressed one. More startling than seeing him out tonight, however, was his assortment of companions. Three angels and a human - none of whom I\u0027d ever met before. All of them watched me, displaying curiosity and - for one of them - scorn at my presence. Whatever. He could scorn all he wanted. It would take more than an angel posse to get to me after everything I\u0027d experienced today. Carter\u0027s company did strike me as odd; I\u0027d never known him to work with others. A grudging curiosity rose up within me, wondering what could have brought them all together - with a human, no less. Noting my scrutiny, Carter winked and made a small gesture of invitation, much to the astonishment of two of the angels. I nodded back in acknowledgement, first stopping by the bar to get a vodka gimlet. When I walked over a minute later, I put on my best saucy succubus attitude and pulled up a chair beside Carter. \"Well, well,\" I said. \"I feel like it\u0027s Rush weekend or something. We\u0027re all entertaining guests, huh?\" \"So I hear,\" he said. He absentmindedly ran a hand through his chin-length blond hair. Unless I was mistaken, it had been washed for the first time in six months. These guests must be serious. \"I also hear one of yours is of a more permanent nature.\" I pulled a face. \"I don\u0027t really want to talk about that, if it\u0027s all the same to you.\" \"Can we expect a cat fight soon?\" \"That joke is so one hour ago. You want to introduce me to the rest of the class?\" This made one of the angels laugh. She had deeply tanned skin and black hair that shone like silk. A merry glitter danced in her eyes as she extended a hand to me. \"Yasmine. And you\u0027re Georgina.\" I nodded back, unable to help a smile. The one she gave me in return filled me with warmth and joy. Maybe some angels weren\u0027t so bad after all. It was a good thing, too, because her companions seemed less thrilled to make my acquaintance. \"I\u0027m Whitney,\" said another slowly, a pretty black woman whose hair consisted of myriad tiny braids. She dressed with a fashion sense that met my standards and wore cat-eye glasses that made her look both cute and wise. Her handshake took a moment in coming, but it did come. I glanced at the last angel expectantly. He had dark brown hair and blue eyes, paired with a long and narrow face. His expression conveyed clear disapproval and a haughty coldness. Now that was behavior I associated with angels. For a moment, I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d speak at all. Then, with great stiffness, he said, \"I\u0027m Joel.\" No handshake followed. I turned to the human. He grinned back with as much enthusiasm as Yasmine and flipped his longish dark hair out of his eyes. \"Vincent Damiani. Nice to meet you.\" \"You too.\" I cut Carter a sly look. \"And all this time, I didn\u0027t think you had any friends.\" \"You\u0027re jumping to conclusions, Daughter of Lilith.\" He sipped from what looked like whiskey straight up. \"They\u0027re here on business.\" \"Ooh. Top secret angel business, huh? What\u0027re you going to do? Dance on a pinhead? Lobby for National Cute Puppy Day?\" Joel\u0027s cold look dropped another ten degrees. \"As if we would discuss our affairs with a dark seductress of evil.\" Yasmine elbowed him with an eye roll. \"She\u0027s joking.\" \"That\u0027s what she wants you to think,\" he warned ominously. \"I for one am not going to let my guard down while she attempts to use her wily and sinister powers of seduction on us.\" Fixing him with a slow, languid smile, I leaned back in the chair, crossing my legs so the skirt rode up my thighs. \"Baby, if I were using my wily and sinister powers of seduction, you\u0027d be the first to know.\" A dark flush stained his cheeks. He fixed his gaze on Carter. \"I don\u0027t know what game you think you\u0027re playing, but you need to get rid of her.\" Carter stayed unfazed. \"She\u0027s harmless - unless you\u0027re a drug-pushing god or a nephilim. Or an introverted writer.\" Yasmine flinched, her cheerful countenance becoming sober. \"Don\u0027t joke about nephilim.\" \"In fact,\" Carter obliviously continued, \"she might fix that little logistical problem. Georgina, I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d mind playing hostess, would you? Vincent needs a place to stay while he\u0027s in town.\" I arched an eyebrow in surprise. Misinterpreting my silence, Vincent hastily added, \"It\u0027s okay if you don\u0027t want to. I mean, you don\u0027t even know me. I can see how that\u0027d be weird.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" I told him, even more curious as to what was transpiring with this odd group. \"If angels vouch for you...well, you can\u0027t really get a better recommendation than that. If you don\u0027t mind sleeping on the couch, it\u0027s fine by me.\" \"You\u0027re a pearl among succubi,\" Carter declared. Joel nearly choked on his drink. Considering his stick-up-the-ass attitude, I doubted he had anything alcoholic. Probably Kool-Aid or Pepsi. Diet Pepsi, at that. \"Are you out of your mind?\" he exclaimed. \"She\u0027s a succubus. You can\u0027t subject him to that. Think about his soul.\" \"She\u0027s not really into nice guys,\" Carter said. \"Usually. You won\u0027t have a problem.\" Yasmine offered Vincent a playful look. \"He\u0027s not that nice anyway.\" \"Carter - \" began Joel. \"I told you, she\u0027s fine. Let it go. You have my word. Besides, she won\u0027t ask any questions, and it\u0027ll give him an accessible place to stay while you guys search.\" I jumped on the word \"search.\" Now we were getting somewhere. \"What are you guys looking for?\" Dead silence met me. Whitney crossed her arms. Vincent sipped his drink. \"Okay, I get it.\" I finished the gimlet with a gulp. \"Need to know basis. Mum\u0027s the word. Hush-hush and all that.\" Yasmine\u0027s easy grin returned. \"I love her, Carter. No wonder you keep her around.\" She then started talking about another succubus she\u0027d met in Boston, smoothly changing subjects as deftly as Carter could. Guessing what I was thinking, Carter caught my eye and grinned. I rolled my own eyes in exasperation. Nonetheless, as the evening progressed, I found myself liking Yasmine immensely. She, Vincent, and Carter carried most of the conversation, and while angels weren\u0027t nearly as fun as the rest of my friends, I found this group entertaining in their own way. They also swore and drank a lot less, but well, nobody\u0027s perfect. When the bar closed, I took Vincent with me, but not before Joel issued warnings about the sanctity of the human soul. Vincent listened to it with a patient face, nodding along at the key parts. \"Is he always like that?\" I asked on the drive home. Vincent laughed. \"He can\u0027t help it. He means well. He\u0027s just worried about me.\" \"Are you worried?\" \"Nah. You\u0027re pretty cute, but no, I\u0027m not worried. I\u0027m already in love with someone.\" I started to joke that that was no protection against anything, that I\u0027d seduced plenty of guys who thought they were in love. Something in his voice stopped my quip. The way he spoke implied that being in love was indeed protection from me and all the other evils of the world. He spoke like one who was invincible. I suddenly felt sad. \"Good for you,\" I said softly. He cut me a sidelong look. \"You\u0027re okay for a succubus.\" \"Okay enough to tell me what you and the Super Friends are doing in town?\" A smile flashed back over his face. \"No.\" At home, I set him up on the couch, producing piles of blankets to keep him warm. I kept my apartment at a steamy temperature most of the time, but it was December, and the part of me that still remembered huddling around meager fires in days gone by felt one could never have enough blankets. I soon went to bed, buried under my own stash of covers. This time, I didn\u0027t dream.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-2.html","bookId":2056,"book":{"id":2056,"title":"Succubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid #3)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 3: Succubus Dreams especially when the girl in question is Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men.
