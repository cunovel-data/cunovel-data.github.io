{"id":3620,"no":36,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 2","content":"I MARRIED WHILE I was still clerking. Gertrud and I had met at the ski lodge, and when the others left at the end of vacation, she stayed behind until I was released from the hospital and she could take me home. She was also studying law; we studied together, passed our exams together, and began our clerking together. We got married when Gertrud got pregnant.\\n\\n I did not tell her about Hanna. Who, I thought, wants to know about the other’s earlier relationships, if he or she is not the fulfillment of their promise? Gertrud was smart, efficient, and loyal, and if our life had involved running a farm with lots of farmhands and maids, lots of children, lots of work, and no time for each other, it would have been fulfilling and happy. But our life was a three-room apartment in a modern building on the edge of the city, our daughter Julia and Gertrud’s and my work as legal clerks. I could never stop comparing the way it was with Gertrud and the way it had been with Hanna; again and again, Gertrud and I would hold each other, and I would feel that something was wrong, that she was wrong, that she moved wrong and felt wrong, smelled wrong and tasted wrong. I thought I would get over it. I hoped it would go away. I wanted to be free of Hanna. But I never got over the feeling that something was wrong.\\n\\n We got divorced when Julia was five. Neither of us could keep things going; we parted without bitterness and retained our loyalty to each other. It tormented me that we were denying Julia the sense of warmth and safety she obviously craved. When Gertrud and I were open and warm with each other, Julia swam in it like a fish in water. She was in her element. When she sensed tension between us, she ran from one to the other to assure us that we were good and she loved us. She longed for a little brother and probably would have been happy with more siblings. For a long time, she didn’t understand what divorce meant; when I came to visit, she wanted me to stay, and when she came to visit me, she wanted Gertrud to come too. When it was time to go, and she watched me from the window, and I had to get into the car under her sad gaze, it broke my heart. And I had the feeling that what we were denying her was not only her wish, but her right. We had cheated her of her rights by getting divorced, and the fact that we did it together didn’t halve the guilt.\\n\\n I tried to approach my later relationships better, and to get into them more deeply. I admitted to myself that a woman had to move and feel a bit like Hanna, smell and taste a bit like her for things to be good between us. I told them about Hanna. And I told them more about myself than I had told Gertrud; they had to be able to make sense of whatever they might find disconcerting in my behavior and moods. But the women didn’t want to hear that much. I remember Helen, an American literary critic who stroked my back silently and soothingly as I talked, and continued to stroke me just as silently and soothingly after I’d stopped speaking. Gesina, a psychoanalyst, thought I needed to work through my relationship with my mother. Did it not strike me that my mother hardly appeared in my story at all? Hilke, a dentist, kept asking about the time before we met, but immediately forgot whatever I told her. So I stopped talking about it. There’s no need to talk, because the truth of what one says lies in what one does.\\n\\n 　　当我还是候补官员时我就结了婚。葛特茹德和我是在滑雪棚中认识的。在假期结束时，其他人都回去后，她仍旧留了下来，一直呆到我出院，然后把我送了回去。她也是学法律的，我们一起学习，一起通过考试并一起成为候补官员。当她怀孕时，我们结了婚。\\n\\n 　　我没有向她提起汉娜的事。我想，如果不是有义务，谁愿意听我来讲我以前与另外一个人的关系呢？葛特茹德聪明、勤奋、忠实。如果我们的生活是经营一座农庄，雇用许多男女奴工，生许多孩子，有许多活要干，没有时间给对方的话，那么我们的生活会充实幸福的。但是，一个三口之家，女儿朱丽雅和两个候补官员，即葛特茹德和我，住在市郊的一处新建楼房的三居室里，这就是我们的生活。与葛特茹德在一起时，我一直无法停止把她和我的共同生活与我和汉娜的共同生活进行比较。每当我们拥抱在一起时，我总有一种不对劲的感觉、有一种她不对劲的感觉，她接触和抚摸的地方不对，她的气味不对，滋味也不对。我想，这种感觉会消失的，我希望这种感觉会消失，我想摆脱汉娜，但是，这种不对劲的感觉从未消失过。\\n\\n 　　当朱丽雅五岁时，我们离了婚，因为我们两人都无法再忍受下去了。我们没有痛苦地离了婚，此后也忠诚地保持联系。令我痛苦的是我们不能给予朱丽雅安全感，她很明显地希望有这种安全感。当我和葛特茹德亲密无间、彼此之间都有好感时，朱丽雅在我们中间感到如鱼得水一样自由自在。当她注意到我们之间的紧张气氛时，就从我们的一方跑到另一方，向我们保证我们都很可爱，她爱我们。她希望有个小弟弟，也高兴能有很多兄弟姐妹。很长时间内，她没有明白离婚是怎么一回事。当我去看她时，她要我留下来。当她来看我时，要和葛特茹德一起来。每当我离开她时，她都趴着窗户往外看，当我在她伤心目光的注视下上车时，我感到心已碎。我有一种感觉，我们没有给予她的不仅仅是她的一种愿望，而是她拥有这种愿望的权利。当我们离婚时，我们就骗取了她的权利，我们共同做了这件事，但我们的罪责并没有因此减半。\\n\\n 　　我试图再建立一个较好的婚姻关系。我承认，我要找的女人必须要有点像汉娜，像她那样接触和抚摸，其气味和滋味都必须有点像汉娜的，只有这样，我们的共同生活才不会有不对劲的感觉。而且，我跟她们讲我和汉娜的事。我也在其他女人面前比在葛特茹德面前更多地讲述了我自己。她们应该按照自己的想法解释我在举止言谈中表现出来的令她们感到惊异的东西。但是，那些女人不想听得太多。我记得海伦，一位研究美国文学的学者，当我讲述时，她默默无声抚摸我的后背，安慰我；我停止讲述时，她同样默默无声地继续抚摸我，安慰我。葛西娜是位精神分析学家，她认为，我必须清理我与母亲的关系。她问过我是否注意到我的母亲在我的故事中几乎没有出现过？希尔克是位牙医，她翻来覆去地问我以前的事情，但是，随后就忘了我给她讲的一切。这样一来，我就又什么都不讲了，因为人们所讲的，不过是人们自己所做的，既然是事实，那就不一定非讲木可。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406/3443.html","bookId":130,"book":{"id":130,"title":"朗读者The Reader","description":"简介： 二战后作为战败国的德国处在盟军和苏军的管制中，万事萧条，百废待兴。生活在柏林的15岁少年迈克伯格患上了猩红热，但他仍然时不时的坐车到很远的图书馆中找寻自己爱看的书籍...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/111022/1-111022151520116.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
