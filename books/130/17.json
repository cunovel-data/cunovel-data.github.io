{"id":3601,"no":17,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 17","content":"N EXT DAY she was gone. I came at the usual time and rang the bell. I looked through the door, everything looked the way it always did, I could hear the clock ticking. I sat down on the stairs once again. During our first few months, I had always known what line she was working on, even though I had never repeated my attempt to accompany her or even pick her up afterwards. At some point I had stopped asking, stopped even wondering. It hadn’t even occurred to me until now. I used the telephone booth at the Wilhelmsplatz to call the streetcar company, was transferred from one person to the next, and finally was told that Hanna Schmitz had not come to work. I went back to Bahnhofstrasse, asked at the carpenter’s shop in the yard for the name of the owner of the building, and got a name and address in Kirchheim. I rode over there. “Frau Schmitz? She moved out this morning.” “And her furniture?” “It’s not her furniture.” “How long did she live in the apartment?” “What’s it to you?” The woman who had been talking to me through a window in the door slammed it shut. In the administration building of the streetcar company, I talked my way through to the personnel department. The man in charge was friendly and concerned. “She called this morning early enough for us to arrange for a substitute, and said that she wouldn’t be coming back, period.” He shook his head. “Two weeks ago she was sitting there in your chair and I offered to have her trained as a driver, and she throws it all away.” It took me some days to think of going to the citizens’ registration office. She had informed them she was moving to Hamburg, but without giving an address. The days went by and I felt sick. I took pains to make sure my parents and my brothers and sisters noticed nothing. I joined in the conversation at table a little, ate a little, and when I had to throw up, I managed to make it to the toilet. I went to school and to the swimming pool. I spent my afternoons there in an out-of-the-way place where no one would look for me. My body yearned for Hanna. But even worse than my physical desire was my sense of guilt. Why hadn’t I jumped up immediately when she stood there and run to her! This one moment summed up all my halfheartedness of the past months, which had produced my denial of her, and my betrayal. Leaving was her punishment. Sometimes I tried to tell myself that it wasn’t her I had seen. How could I be sure it was her when I hadn’t been able to make out the face? If it had been her, wouldn’t I have had to recognize her face? So couldn’t I be sure it wasn’t her at all? But I knew it was her. She stood and looked—and it was too late. 　　第二天她不在了。和往常的时间一样我去了她那里，按响了门铃。透过房门我看到一切依旧，听得见挂钟在滴答滴答地响。 　　我又坐在了楼梯台阶上。在最初的几个月里，我一直知道她在哪条路段工作，尽管我不再设法去陪伴她，也不再想方设法去接她。不知从什么时候起，我不再问起此事，对此不再感兴趣了。现在，我又想到这事。 　　在威廉广场的电话厅里，我给有轨电车公司打了电话。电话被转来转去，最后得知汉娜·史密芝没有去上班。我又回到了火车站街，在院子里的木工厂那儿打听到那座房子为谁所有。我得到了一个名字和地址。这样我就去了基西海姆。 　　\"史密芝女士？她今天早上搬了出去。\" 　　\"那她的家具呢？\" 　　\"那不是她的家具。\" 　　\"她是从什么时候起住在那个房子里的？\" 　　\"这与您有什么关系呢？\"那个透过门窗跟我说话的女人把窗户关上了。 　　在有轨电车公司的办公大楼里，我到处打听人事部。有关的一位负责人很友好，也很担忧。 　　\"她今天早上打来电话，很及时，使我们有可能安排别人来代替。她说她不再来了，彻底地不来了。\"他摇着头说，\"十四天前，她坐在您现在的位子上，我给她提供了一次受培训当司机的机会，可她放弃了一切。\" 　　几天以后，我才想起来去居民登记局。她注销了户籍去了汉堡，可没有留下地址。 　　我难受了许多天，注意着不让父母和兄弟姐妹看出来。在饭桌上，我参与他们的谈话，吃少许的东西，如果非要呕吐不可，也能忍看到了洗手间才吐出来。我去上学，去游泳池。在游泳池一个无人找得到的偏僻的角落里把下午的时间打发掉。我的肉体思念着汉娜，但是，比这种肉体的思念更严重的是我的负疚感。当她站在那儿时，我为什么没有立即跳起来向她跑过去！这件小事使我联想起了我在过去的几个月里对她的半心半意，由于这种半心半意，我否认了她，背叛了她。她的离去是对我的惩罚。 　　有时候，我企图这样开脱自己，说我看见的那个人不是她。我怎么能确信就是她呢？当时我的确没有看清楚她的脸。如果真的是她，难道我连她都认不出来吗？我真的不能确定那个人是不是她。 　　但是，我知道那个人就是她。她站在那儿，望着我。一切都晚了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406/3424.html","bookId":130,"book":{"id":130,"title":"朗读者The Reader","description":"简介： 二战后作为战败国的德国处在盟军和苏军的管制中，万事萧条，百废待兴。生活在柏林的15岁少年迈克伯格患上了猩红热，但他仍然时不时的坐车到很远的图书馆中找寻自己爱看的书籍...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/111022/1-111022151520116.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
