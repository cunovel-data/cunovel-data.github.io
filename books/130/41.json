{"id":3625,"no":41,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 7","content":"A T THE TIME I never thought about the fact that Hanna would be released one day. The exchange of notes and cassettes was so normal and familiar, and Hanna was both close and removed in such an easy way, that I could have continued the situation indefinitely. That was comfortable and selfish, I know.\\n\\n Then came the letter from the prison warden.\\n\\n For years you and Frau Schmitz have corresponded with each other. This is the only contact Frau Schmitz has with the outside world, and so I am turning to you, although I do not know how close your relationship is, and whether you are a relative or a friend.\\n\\n Next year Frau Schmitz will again make an appeal for clemency, and I expect the parole board to grant the appeal. She will then be released quite shortly—after eighteen years in prison. Of course we can find or try to find her an apartment and a job; a job will be difficult at her age, even though she is in excellent health and has shown great skill in our sewing shop. But rather than us taking care of her, it would be better for relatives or friends to do so, to have the released prisoner live nearby, and keep her company and give her support. You cannot imagine how lonely and helpless one can be on the outside after eighteen years in prison.\\n\\n Frau Schmitz can take care of herself quite well, and manages on her own. It would be enough if you could find her a small apartment and a job, visit her, and invite her to your house occasionally during the first weeks and months and make sure she knows about the programs offered by the local congregation, adult education, family support groups, and so on.\\n\\n It is not easy, after eighteen years, to go into the city for the first time, go shopping, deal with the authorities, go to a restaurant. Doing it with someone else helps.\\n\\n I have noticed that you do not visit Frau Schmitz. If you did, I would not have written to you, but would have asked to talk to you during one of your visits. Now it seems as if you will have to visit her before she is released. Please come and see me at that opportunity.\\n\\n The letter closed with sincere greetings which I did not think referred to me, but to the fact that the warden was sincere about the issue. I had heard of her; her institution was considered extraordinary, and her opinion on questions of penal reform carried weight. I liked her letter.\\n\\n But I did not like what was coming my way. Of course I would have to see about a job and an apartment, and I did. Friends who neither used nor rented out the apartment attached to their house agreed to let it to Hanna at a low rent. The Greek tailor who occasionally altered my clothes was willing to employ Hanna; his sister, who ran the tailoring business with him, wanted to return to Greece. And long before Hanna could have used them, I looked into the social services and educational programs run by churches and secular organizations. But I put off the visit to Hanna.\\n\\n Precisely because she was both close and removed in such an easy way, I didn’t want to visit her. I had the feeling she could only be what she was to me at an actual distance. I was afraid that the small, light, safe world of notes and cassettes was too artificial and too vulnerable to withstand actual closeness. How could we meet face to face without everything that had happened between us coming to the surface?\\n\\n So the year passed without me going to the prison. For a long time I heard nothing from the warden; a letter in which I described the housing and job situation for Hanna went unanswered. She was probably expecting to talk to me when I visited Hanna. She had no way to know that I was not only putting off this visit, but avoiding it. Finally, however, the decision came down to pardon and release Hanna, and the warden called me. Could I come now? Hanna was getting out in a week.\\n\\n 　　当时，我从未想过汉娜有一天会出狱。问候信和录音带的交流是如此正常和亲密，汉娜对我如此自如，使我感到她既近在咫尺又远在天边，我完全可能让这种状态持续下去。我知道，这很舒适，很自私。\\n\\n 　　然而，女监狱长寄来了一封信：\\n\\n 　　几年以来，史密芝女士与您一直有书 信往来，这是史密芝女士与外界的谁一联系。这样，我只好求助于您，尽管我不知道您与她关系的密切程度，不知您是她的亲属，还是朋友。\\n\\n 　　明年史密芝女士将再次提出赦免申请，我认为，赦免委员会将会批准她的申请。在被监禁了十八年之后，她不久将要被释放。当然了，我们可以为她找房子和工作，也就是说，我们可以尽量为她找房子和工作。依她的年龄来看找工作将会比较困难，尽管她的身体仍旧很健康，尽管她在我们的缝纫厂里表现得非常出色，但是，如果亲属或朋友来操心这件事，在她出狱之后把她安排在他们附近，陪伴她，让她有个依靠，这要比我们来做好得多。您无法想象，一个人被监禁了十八年，出去之后会是多么孤独无助。\\n\\n 　　史密芝女士自理能力非常强。如果您能为她找到一个住处和一份工作，头几周或头几个月能常去看看她，能邀请邀请她，能让她了解教会、业余大学及家庭教育机构提供的各种机会，这就足够了。此外，十八年之后第一次进城购物，与政府部门约谈，或找一家饭店吃饭都不那么容易，有人陪伴就容易多了。\\n\\n 　　我注意到您没有探望过更密芝女士。\\n\\n 　　如果您这样做了，我也就不必给您写信了，而会是借您探望她的机会与您商谈此事。现在没有别的办法，只好请您在她出狱之前来探望她。烦请您借次机会来我这儿一起。\\n\\n 　　那封信以最衷心的问候结束。那问候并未让我感到那是对我的衷心问候，而是让我感到这件事是女监狱长的一桩心事。我已经听说过她，她的机构被认为是极不寻常的，她的意见在监禁法改革问题上举足轻重。我喜欢她的信。\\n\\n 　　但是，我不喜欢我所面临的事情。当然了，我必须要为她找房子，找工作，而且我也付诸行动了。一些朋友愿意把房子里既未使用也尚未出租的小住宅廉价出租给汉娜。我偶尔到一家希腊裁缝那里修改衣服，这位裁缝想雇用汉娜。和他一起经营这家裁缝店的是他的妹妹，她搬回希腊去了。早在汉娜出狱以前，我就开始关心教会和世俗机构所提供的社会福利和教育机会。但是，探望汉娜我却一拖再拖。\\n\\n 　　正因为汉娜对我如此自如，使我感到她既近在咫尺又远在天边，我才不想去探望她。我有一种感觉，她将说她与我像过去一样只能保持一种实际距离。我怕她说，那微不足道的、隐匿的问候和录音带太做作和太伤害人了，她必须因而承受近在咫尺之苦。我们怎么还能再次面对面地接触而对这期间我们之间发生的一切不感到恶心呢？\\n\\n 　　时间就这样过去了，我几乎就要挨到不必去监狱了。我好久没有从女监狱长那儿听到什么消息了。我曾经写过一封信，信中谈到为汉娜找房子和找工作这些汉娜将要面临的问题，但是，我没有得到答复。她大概指望借我探望汉娜之际与我谈一次。她哪里会知道，我不仅把这次探望拖延了下去，而且想逃避它。但是，赦免汉娜的决定终于批下来了，汉娜即将出狱。女监狱长给我打电话，问我现在是否能过去一下。她说，一周之内汉娜就要出来了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406/3448.html","bookId":130,"book":{"id":130,"title":"朗读者The Reader","description":"简介： 二战后作为战败国的德国处在盟军和苏军的管制中，万事萧条，百废待兴。生活在柏林的15岁少年迈克伯格患上了猩红热，但他仍然时不时的坐车到很远的图书馆中找寻自己爱看的书籍...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/111022/1-111022151520116.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
