{"id":3623,"no":39,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 5","content":"I BEGAN WITH the Odyssey. I read it after Gertrud and I had separated. There were many nights when I couldn’t sleep for more than a few hours; I would lie awake, and when I switched on the light and picked up a book, my eyes closed, and when I put the book down and turned off the light, I was wide awake again. So I read aloud, and my eyes didn’t close. And because in all my confused half-waking thoughts that swirled in tormenting circles of memories and dreams around my marriage and my daughter and my life, it was always Hanna who predominated, I read to Hanna. I read to Hanna on tape.\n It was several months before I sent off the tapes. At first I didn’t want to send just bits of it, so I waited until I had recorded all of the Odyssey. Then I began to wonder if Hanna would find the Odyssey sufficiently interesting, so I recorded what I read next after the Odyssey, stories by Schnitzler and Chekhov. Then I put off calling the court that had convicted Hanna to find out where she was serving her sentence. Finally I had everything together, Hanna’s address in a prison near the city where she had been tried and convicted, a cassette player, and the cassettes, numbered from Chekhov to Schnitzler to Homer. And so finally I sent off the package with the machine and the tapes.\n Recently I found the notebook in which I entered what I recorded for Hanna over the years. The first twelve titles were obviously all entered at the same time; at first I probably just read, and then realized that if I didn’t keep notes I would not remember what I had already recorded. Next to the subsequent titles there is sometimes a date, sometimes none, but even without dates I know that I sent Hanna the first package in the eighth year of her imprisonment, and the last in the eighteenth. In the eighteenth, her plea for clemency was granted.\n In general I read to Hanna the things I wanted to read myself at any given moment. With the Odyssey, I found at first that it was hard to take in as much when I read aloud as when I read silently to myself. But that changed. The disadvantage of reading aloud remained the fact that it took longer. But books read aloud also stayed long in my memory. Even today, I can remember things in them absolutely clearly.\n But I also read books I already knew and loved. So Hanna got to hear a great deal of Keller and Fontane, Heine and M?rike. For a long time I didn’t dare to read poetry, but eventually I really enjoyed it, and I learned many of the poems I read by heart. I can still say them today.\n Taken together, the titles in the notebook testify to a great and fundamental confidence in bourgeois culture. I do not ever remember asking myself whether I should go beyond Kafka, Frisch, Johnson, Bachmann, and Lenz, and read experimental literature, literature in which I did not recognize the story or like any of the characters. To me it was obvious that experimental literature was experimenting with the reader, and Hanna didn’t need that and neither did I.\n When I began writing myself, I read these pieces aloud to her as well. I waited until I had dictated my handwritten text, and revised the typewritten version, and had the feeling that now it was finished. When I read it aloud, I could tell if the feeling was right or not. And if not, I could revise it and record a new version over the old. But I didn’t like doing that. I wanted to have my reading be the culmination. Hanna became the court before which once again I concentrated all my energies, all my creativity, all my critical imagination. After that, I could send the manuscript to the publisher.\n I never made a personal remark on the tapes, never asked after Hanna, never told her anything about myself. I read out the title, the name of the author, and the text. When the text was finished, I waited a moment, closed the book, and pressed the Stop button.\n 　　我是从《奥德赛》开始的。我和葛特茹德分手后，我重读了它。许多夜里我只能睡上几小时，我躺在那儿睡不着。当我打开灯拿起一本书看时，眼睛就睁不开了；而当我把书放到一边、关上灯时，我却又睡不着。这样我就大声朗读，大声朗读时，我就不再打盹。当我的大脑处于杂乱无章的回忆和梦幻中时，当痛苦在我脑中盘旋时，当我在似睡非睡的状态中对我的婚姻，对我的女儿和我的生活进行反思时，汉娜总是在左右着我，我干脆就为汉娜朗读，为汉娜在录音机上朗读。\n 　　当我把我录制的录音带寄出去时，几个月的时间已经过去了。起初，我不想寄片段，我在等着把全部的《奥德赛》录完。之后，我又怀疑汉娜是否对《奥德赛》有足够的兴趣。于是，在录完《奥德赛》之后，我又给她录了施尼茨勒和契河夫的短篇小说。然后，我硬着头皮给审判汉娜的法庭打了电话，打听出了汉娜在什么地方服刑。最后，我把一切都准备好了：汉娜服刑监狱的地址——它离审判和判处汉娜的城市不远，一台录音机和按照契河天——施尼茨勒——荷马这个顺序录制的录音带。最后，我把录音机和录音带一同打进邮包，寄给了汉娜了\n 　　最近，我找到了一个本子，上面记有那些年我为汉娜录过的东西。最早的十二个篇目很显然是同时做的记录。起初，我大概只是往下读，后来才注意到没有记录就记不住已经读过什么了。在后来的篇目中，有时注明了日期，有时没有注明，但是，即使是没有日期，我也知道第一次给汉娜寄录音带是她服刑的第八年，最后一次是第十八年。在第十八年的时候，她的赦免申请被批准。\n 　　我继续为汉娜朗读，读我自己也正想看的书。在录制《奥德赛》时我注意到，大声朗读不像自己轻声阅读那样容易让我集中精力，后来有所好转。朗读的缺点是它持续的时间较长，但是，正因为如此它才使朗读者把内容深深地铭刻在脑子里。至今我对一些内容仍记忆犹新。\n 　　我也朗读我已经熟悉和喜爱的作品。这样汉娜能听到很多凯勒、冯塔纳、海涅和默里克的作品。很长时间里，我不敢朗读诗歌，但是后来，我却乐此不疲。我可以背诵一系列我所朗读过的诗歌，时至今日仍能朗朗上口。\n 　　那个记录本所记载的书目，证明了受过教育的市民阶层的原始信赖。我也不记得了，是否我曾经想过不必局限于卡夫卡、弗里施、约翰逊、巴克曼和伦茨而读一些实验文学作品，也就是我既弄不清故事讲的是什么也不喜欢其中的任何人物的文学作品。我认为，实验文学自然是要拿读者做实验，汉娜和我都不需要这个。\n 　　当我自己开始写作时，我也把我写的东西拿来为她朗读。我要等我的手稿口授之后，打字稿也修改过以后，而且有了一种完全做好了的感觉之后才朗读。在朗读时，我能发现我的感觉正确与否。如果不正确，我可以重新再来，把！目的去掉，重新录制。但是．我不喜欢这样做，我想用朗读来划个圆满句号。我把我的一切力量。一切创造力和富于批判的想象力再次为汉娜调动起来。这之后，我才把手稿寄给出版社。\n 　　在录音中，我没做个人的评论，没有问起过汉娜的情况，没有讲述过我自己的情况。我只朗读书名、作者名和书的内容。当内容结束对，我稍等一会儿，合上书，按下录音机的停止键。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406/3446.html","bookId":130,"book":{"id":130,"title":"朗读者The Reader","description":"简介： 二战后作为战败国的德国处在盟军和苏军的管制中，万事萧条，百废待兴。生活在柏林的15岁少年迈克伯格患上了猩红热，但他仍然时不时的坐车到很远的图书馆中找寻自己爱看的书籍...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/111022/1-111022151520116.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
