{"id":3617,"no":33,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 16","content":"I DID GO to the presiding judge after all. I couldn’t make myself visit Hanna. But neither could I endure doing nothing.\\n\\n Why didn’t I manage to speak to Hanna? She had left me, deceived me, was not the person I had taken her for or imagined her to be. And who had I been for her? The little reader she used, the little bedmate with whom she’d had her fun? Would she have sent me to the gas chamber if she hadn’t been able to leave me, but wanted to get rid of me?\\n\\n Why did I find it unendurable to do nothing? I told myself I had to prevent a miscarriage of justice. I had to make sure justice was done, despite Hanna’s lifelong lie, justice both for and against Hanna, so to speak. But I wasn’t really concerned with justice. I couldn’t leave Hanna the way she was, or wanted to be. I had to meddle with her, have some kind of influence and effect on her, if not directly then indirectly.\\n\\n The judge knew about our seminar group and was happy to invite me to come and talk after a session in court. I knocked, was invited in, greeted, and offered the chair in front of his desk. He was sitting in his shirtsleeves behind it. His robe hung over the back and arms of his chair; he had sat down in the robe and then slipped out of it. He seemed relaxed, a man who had finished his day’s work and was content. Without the irritated expression he hid behind during the trial, he had a nice, intelligent, harmless civil servant’s face.\\n\\n He made general easy chitchat, asking me about this and that: what our seminar group thought of the trial, what our professor intended to do with the trial record, which semester we were in, which semester I was in, why I was studying law and when I planned to take my exams. He told me I must be sure to register for the exams on time.\\n\\n I answered all his questions. Then I listened while he talked about his studies and his exams. He had done everything the right way. He had taken the right classes and seminars at the right time and had passed his final exams with the right degree of success. He liked being a lawyer and a judge, and if he had to do it all again he would do it the same way.\\n\\n The window was open. In the parking lot, doors were being slammed and engines turned on. I listened to the cars until their noise was swallowed up in the roar of the traffic. Then children came to play and yell in the emptied parking lot. Sometimes a word came through quite clearly: a name, an insult, a call.\\n\\n The judge stood up and said goodbye. He told me I could come again if I had any other questions, or if I wanted advice on my studies. And he would like to know our seminar group’s evaluation and analysis of the trial.\\n\\n I walked through the empty parking lot. One of the bigger boys told me how I could walk to the railroad station. Our car pool had driven back right after the session, and I had to take the train. It was a slow rush-hour train that stopped at every station; people got on and off. I sat at the window, surrounded by ever-changing passengers, conversations, smells. Outside, houses passed by, and roads, cars, trees, distant mountains, castles, and quarries. I took it all in and felt nothing. I was no longer upset at having been left, deceived, and used by Hanna. I no longer had to meddle with her. I felt the numbness with which I had followed the horrors of the trial settling over the emotions and thoughts\\n\\n 　　我到底还是去找了审判长。去找汉娜我做不到，但是，袖手旁观什么都不做，我也做不到。\\n\\n 　　与汉娜谈一谈为什么我做不到呢？她离我而去，她欺骗了我，她不是那个我了解的汉娜，或令我为之想入非非的汉娜，而我对她来说又是何许人呢？一个被她利用的小朗读者？一个陪她睡觉，使她获得床第之欢的小家伙？如果无法离开我，但又想摆脱我时，她也会把我送进毒气室吗？\\n\\n 　　那么，为什么我连袖手旁观也做不到呢？我心想，我一定要阻止一场错误的判决。我一定要主持公道，一种不计较汉娜的生活谎言的绝对公道，它或许对汉娜有利，也可能对她不利，但是，对我来说，这的确不是公道不公道的问题。我不能让汉娜想怎样就怎样，想怎么说就怎么说。我必须要对她施加影响，如果不能直接地，就间接地。\\n\\n 　　审判长知道我们这个小组，愿意在下次开庭后与我谈一次。我敲了敲门，然后被请了进去。他问候我之后请我坐在写字台前面的一把椅子上。他只穿了个衬衫，坐在写字台的后面。他的法官长袍挂在椅背和椅子的扶手上。他朝长袍坐下去，然后又让长袍滑落在地上。他看上去很轻松，像一个完成了当天的工作并对此感到很满意的人。脸上没有在法庭审理期间那种烦躁易怒的表情，取而代之的是一副和蔼可亲、充满智慧、心地善良的政府官员的面部表情，原来他在法庭上用假面具把自己掩饰了起来。他无拘无束地与我聊天，向我问这问那，譬如，我们这个小组对法庭审理程序是怎样想的，我们的教授对法庭备忘录将如何处理，我们是几年级的学生，我上了几个学期了，我为什么要学法律，我想何时参加考试等等。还说，报名参加考试无论如何不应该太晚。\\n\\n 　　我回答了所有的问题。之后我听他给我讲述了他的学习和考试的情况。他把一切都做得很好，他及时地以优异的成绩修满了各科学分，最后又及时地参加了毕业考试。他喜欢做法学家和法官，如果让他重新做一遍的话，他仍旧会如此去做。\\n\\n 　　窗户敞开着，我听得见停车场上的关门声和一辆车发动马达的声音。我听着那辆车开出去，直到它的声音被喧嚣的交通淹没为止。之后，我听得见孩子们在空旷的停车场上的玩耍吵闹声，时而非常清楚地听得见一个名字、一句骂人话或一声喊叫。\\n\\n 　　审判长站起来与我告别，他说如果我还有什么问题尽管再来找他，如果需要学业上的咨询也可找他。还说我们小组对审判程序的分析评估结果应该让他知道。\\n\\n 　　我向空旷的停车场走去，请一个稍大一点的男孩告诉我去火车站的路怎么走。我们一起乘车的那伙人在休庭之后马上就赶了回去，我只好坐火车回去。这是一辆慢行的班车，每站都停，人们上上下下。我靠窗坐着，被其他旅客的谈笑声和他们身上所发出的气味所环绕。外面的一座座房子、一条条街道、一辆辆汽车、一棵棵树木从窗外掠过，远处看得见山脉、城堡和采石场。我能看见一切，但对什么都毫无感觉。我不再为汉娜的弃我而去、为她对我的欺骗和利用感到伤心，我不必再对她施加什么影响了。在参加法庭的审理的过程中，对那些骇人听闻的事情我感到麻木木仁。现在我注意到，这种麻木不仁在过去的几周里对我的感觉和思想产生了影响。如果说我完全解脱了的话，那么未免有些言过其词了，但是我认为这样做是对的，这样才有可能让我重新回到我的日常生活中去，并在这种生活中继续生活下去。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406/3440.html","bookId":130,"book":{"id":130,"title":"朗读者The Reader","description":"简介： 二战后作为战败国的德国处在盟军和苏军的管制中，万事萧条，百废待兴。生活在柏林的15岁少年迈克伯格患上了猩红热，但他仍然时不时的坐车到很远的图书馆中找寻自己爱看的书籍...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/111022/1-111022151520116.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
