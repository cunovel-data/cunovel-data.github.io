{"id":3618,"no":34,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 17","content":"T HE VERDICT was handed down at the end of June. Hanna was sentenced to life. The others received terms in jail. The courtroom was as full as it had been at the beginning of the trial. People from the justice system, students from my university and the local one, a class of schoolchildren, domestic and foreign journalists, and the people who always find their way into courtrooms. It was loud. At first, no one noticed when the defendants were brought in. But then the spectators fell silent. The first to stop talking were those sitting up front near the defendants. They nudged their neighbors and turned around to those sitting behind them. “Look,” they whispered, and those who looked fell silent too and nudged their neighbors and turned to those sitting behind them and whispered, “Look!” Until eventually the whole courtroom was silent. I don’t know if Hanna knew how she looked, or maybe she wanted to look like that. She was wearing a black suit and a white blouse, and the cut of the suit and the tie that went with the blouse made her look as if she were in uniform. I have never seen the uniform of the women who worked for the SS. But I believed, and the spectators all believed, that before us we were seeing that uniform, and the woman who had worked for the SS in it, and all the crimes Hanna was accused of doing. The spectators began to whisper again. Many were audibly outraged. They felt that Hanna was ridiculing the trial, the verdict, and themselves, they who had come to hear the verdict read out. They became more vociferous, and some of them began calling out what they thought of Hanna. But then the court entered the courtroom and after an irritated glance at Hanna, the judge announced the verdict. Hanna listened standing up, straight-backed, and absolutely motionless. She sat down during the reading of the reasons for the verdict. I did not take my eyes off her head and neck. The entire verdict took several hours to read. When the trial was over and the defendants were being led away, I waited to see whether Hanna would look at me. I was sitting in the same place I always sat. But she looked straight ahead and through everything. A proud, wounded, lost, and infinitely tired look. A look that wished to see nothing and no one. 　　六月底，宣布了审判结果。汉娜被判处终身监禁，其他人被判处有期徒刑。 　　法院大厅里像审判之初一样座无虚席，其中有司法部门的工作人员、我所在大学及当地大学的学生们、一组中学生、国内外的记者和那些平时总是在场的人。大厅里喧嚣不止。当被告被传叫送来时，起初没有人注意她们，但是随后大厅就变得鸦雀无声了。首先是在被告前就座的听众安静了下来。他们碰碰左右的邻居，然后转过身来对坐在后面的人低声地说道：\"注意看片于是后面的人开始向前看，并安静下来。他们再碰碰左右邻居，然后转向他们身后的男人低声说：\"注意看！。这样，审判大厅终于变得鸦雀无声了。 　　我不知道是否汉娜自己也清楚她看上去是什么样子，也许她愿意看上去就是这个样子。她穿了一套黑色套装，配一件白衬衫。那套装的式样和衬衫的领带使她看上去就好像穿了一套制服。我从未见过为纳粹党卫军工作的女人们所穿的制服，但是我认为——所有其他的听众也都这样认为，我们眼前的这个制服就是纳粹党卫军的女式制服，这个女人就是穿着这样的制服为纳粹党卫军工作的，汉娜的所作所为就是她被控告的原因。 　　听众又开始小声嘀咕起来。很多人发出的愤怒的声音都可以听得到。他们认为审判过程、判决还有那些为听宣读判决结果而来的人都被汉娜嘲弄了。他们的声音越来越大，少数人向汉娜又喊又叫，清楚地说出他们认为汉娜是什么东西，直到审判人员步人大厅，审判长愤怒地看着汉娜宣布判决结果时人们才安静下来。汉娜笔直地站着，一动不动地听着。当宣读判决原因时，她坐了下来。我的目光一直没有离开汉娜的头和后颈。 　　宣判持续了好几个小时。当宣判结束后被告被带走时，我在等着，看汉娜是否会看我一眼。我坐在老位子上。但是，她目不斜视，看穿了一切。那是一种高傲的、受到伤害的、绝望的、无限疲惫的目光，一种任何人、任何东西都不想看的目光。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406/3441.html","bookId":130,"book":{"id":130,"title":"朗读者The Reader","description":"简介： 二战后作为战败国的德国处在盟军和苏军的管制中，万事萧条，百废待兴。生活在柏林的15岁少年迈克伯格患上了猩红热，但他仍然时不时的坐车到很远的图书馆中找寻自己爱看的书籍...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/111022/1-111022151520116.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/406","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
