{"id":30626,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER 17","content":"A flourish of trumpets announced the return of the Lady Iduna and the Prince of Athens, magnificently attired, came forward with a smile, and led her, with a compliment on her resuming the dress of her sex, if not of her country, to the banquet. Iduna was not uninfluenced by that excitement which is insensibly produced by a sudden change of scene and circumstances, and especially by an unexpected transition from hardship, peril, and suffering, to luxury, security, and enjoyment. Their spirits were elevated and gay: she smiled upon Nic?|us with a cheerful sympathy. They feasted, they listened to sweet music, they talked over their late adventures, and, animated by their own enjoyment, they became more sanguine as to the fate of Iskander. “In two or three days we shall know more,” said Nic?|us. “In the meantime, rest is absolutely necessary to you. It is only now that you will begin to be sensible of the exertion you have made. If Iskander be at Croia, he has already informed your father of your escape; if he have not arrived, I have arranged that a courier shall be dispatched to Hunniades from that city. Do not be anxious. Try to be happy. I am myself sanguine that you will find all well. Come, pledge me your father’s health, fair lady, in this goblet of Tenedos!” “How know I that at this moment he may not be at the point of death,” replied Iduna. “When I am absent from those I love, I dream only of their unhappiness.” “At this moment also,” rejoined Nic?|us, “he dreams perhaps of your imprisonment among barbarians. Yet how mistaken! Let that consideration support you. Come! here is to the Eremite.” “As willing, if not as sumptuous, a host as our present one,” said Iduna; “and when, by-the-bye, do you think that your friend, the Lord Justinian, will arrive?” “Oh! never mind him,” said Nic?|us. “He would have arrived to-morrow, but the great news which I gave him has probably changed his plans. I told him of the approaching invasion, and he has perhaps found it necessary to visit the neighbouring chieftains, or even to go on to Croia.” “Well-a-day!” exclaimed Iduna, “I would we were in my father’s camp!” “We shall soon be there, dear lady,” replied the Prince. “Come, worthy Seneschal,” he added, turning to that functionary, “drink to this noble lady’s happy meeting with her friends.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2868/79274.html","bookId":1180,"book":{"id":1180,"title":"The Rise of Iskander","description":"简介： The sun had set behind the mountains, and the rich plain of Athens was suffused with the violet glow of a Grecian eye.
