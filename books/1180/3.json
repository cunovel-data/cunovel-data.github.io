{"id":30612,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER 3","content":"Three weeks bad elapsed since the parting of Iskander and Nic?|us, when the former, at the head of ten thousand men, entered by a circuitous route the defiles of Mount H?|mus, and approached the Turkish camp, which had been pitched, upon a vast and elevated table-ground, commanded on all sides by superior heights, which, however, were fortified and well-garrisoned by Janissaries. The Epirots halted, and immediately prepared to raise their tents, while their commander, attended by a few of his officers, instantly proceeded to the pavilion of Karam Bey. The arrival of Iskander diffused great joy among the soldiery; and as he passed through the encampment, the exclamations of the Turkish warriors announced how ready they were to be led to the charge by a chieftain who had been ever successful. A guard of honour, by the orders of Karam Bey, advanced to conduct Iskander to his presence; and soon, entering the pavilion, the Grecian prince exchanged courtesies with the Turkish general. After the formal compliments had passed, Karam Bey waved his hand, and the pavilion was cleared, with the exception of Mousa, the chief secretary, and favourite of Karam. “You have arrived in good time, Iskander, to assist in the destruction of the Christian dogs,” said the Bey. “Flushed with their accursed success, they have advanced too far. Twice they have endeavoured to penetrate the mountains; and each time they have been forced to retire, with great loss. The passages are well barricadoed with timber and huge fragments of rock. The dogs have lost all heart, and are sinking under the joint sufferings of hunger and cold. Our scouts tell me they exhibit symptoms of retreat. We must rush down from the mountains, and annihilate them.” “Is Hunniades here in person?” inquired Iskander. “He is here,” replied Karam, “in person, the dog of dogs! Come, Iskander, his head would be a fine Ramadan present to Amurath. ‘Tis a head worth three tails, I guess.” Mousa, the chief secretary, indulged in some suppressed laughter at this joke. Iskander smiled. “If they retreat we must assuredly attack them,” observed Iskander, musingly. “I have a persuasion that Hunniades and myself will soon meet.” “If there be truth in the Prophet!” exclaimed Karam. “I have no doubt of it. Hunniades is reserved for you, Bey. We shall hold up our heads at court yet, Iskander. You have had letters lately?” “Some slight words.” “No mention of us, of course?” “Nothing, except some passing praise of your valour and discretion.” “We do our best, we do our best. Will Isa Bey have ??tolia, think you?” “I have no thoughts. Our royal father will not forget his children, and Isa Bey is a most valiant chieftain.” “You heard not that he was coming here?” inquired Karam. “Have you?” responded the cautious Iskander. “A rumour, a rumour,” replied Karam. “He is at Adrianople, think you?” “It may be so: I am, you know, from Athens.” “True, true. We shall beat them, Iskander, we shall beat them.” “For myself, I feel sanguine,” replied the Prince, and he arose to retire. “I must at present to my men. We must ascertain more accurately the movements of the Christians before we decide on our own. I am inclined myself to reconnoitre them. How far may it be?” “There is not room to form our array between them and the mountains,” replied Karam. “‘Tis well. Success attend the true believers! By to-morrow’s dawn we shall know more.” \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2868/79260.html","bookId":1180,"book":{"id":1180,"title":"The Rise of Iskander","description":"简介： The sun had set behind the mountains, and the rich plain of Athens was suffused with the violet glow of a Grecian eye.
