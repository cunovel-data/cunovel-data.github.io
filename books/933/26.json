Maitre Nicolay!\" the marquis shouted. \"Holloa!\" and a head showed up the companion. On seeing who it was, the speaker emerged. \"It is you, Maitre Perrot.\" \"Have you your cargo on board?\" \"Every barrel,\" said the skipper. \"We sail tomorrow morning.\" \"I will give you two hundred and fifty louis if you will sail in ten minutes, and as much more if you land us safely in England.\" \"Really?\" \"Really.\" \"It is a bargain. Holloa! Pierre! Etienne!\" Two lads ran up from below. \"Run to the wine shops on the quay, fetch the crew. Just whisper in their ears. Say I am casting off, that no man must wait to say goodbye to his wife, and that each down in five minutes will have as many louis, and that in ten I sail, if with only half the crew. Run! Run!\" The two boys set off at full speed. \"I fear ten minutes will be impossible, Maitre Perrot; but all that can be done, shall. Is ten absolutely necessary?\" \"Twenty may do, Maitre Nicolay; but if we are not off by that time, we shall not be able to go at all.\" \"You are pursued?\" \"Yes. In half an hour at latest a troop of soldiers will be here after us.\" Maitre Nicolay looked at the sky. \"There is wind enough when we once get well beyond the town; but unless we get a good start they will overtake us in boats. Is it a state affair, Maitre Perrot? For I own to you I don\u0027t like running my head against the state.\" \"I will tell you frankly, captain. I am the Marquis de Pignerolles. This is my daughter. The king wants her to marry a man she does not like, and I am running away with her, to save her from being shut up in a convent till she agrees.\" \"And this one?\" Maitre Nicolay said, pointing to Rupert. \"That is the gentleman whom both I and my daughter like better than the king\u0027s choice.\" \"That is all right,\" Maitre Nicolay said. \"There is no hanging matter in that. But look, sir; if you should be late, and they come up with us in boats, or warn the forts at the entrance, mind, we cannot fight; you must send us all below, with your swords and pistols, you see, and batten us down, so that we shan\u0027t be responsible, else I could never show my face in a French port again. \"Ah! Here come four of the men; yes, and two more after them. That is good. \"Now,\" he said, when the men came up, \"not a question, not a word. There is money, but it has to be earned. Now set to work. Loosen the sails, and get all ready for casting off.\" In a quarter of an hour from the moment the party had reached the Belle Jeanne eight men had arrived, and although these were but half her crew, the captain, who had been throwing himself heart and soul in the work, declared that he would wait for no more. The last rope was thrown off, and the lugger dropped out into the stream. It was running rapidly out; and as the wind caught the sails, the Belle Jeanne began to move, standing down towards the sea. During the time the lugger had been prepared for sea the passengers had remained below, so as not to attract the attention of the little crowd of sailors whom the sudden departure had assembled on the quay. But they now came up on deck. Scarcely were they in the middle of the stream, and the sails had fairly gathered way on her, when Rupert exclaimed, \"There they are!\" as a party of horseman rode down on to the quay, now nearly a quarter of a mile away. Then a faint shout came across the water, followed by a musket shot, the ball splashing in the water a little way astern. The men looked at each other and at their captain. \"Look here, lads, I will tell you the truth about this matter; and I know that, as men of La Vendee, you will agree with me. This gentleman who crossed with us before is a noble, and the king wants this lady, his daughter, to marry a man she does not like. The father agrees with her; and he and her fiance, this gentleman here, have run away with her, to prevent her being locked up. Now we are bound, as true Vendeans, to assist them; and besides, they are going to pay handsomely. Each of you will get ten louis if we land them safe in England. \"But you know we cannot resist the law; so we must let these gentlemen, with their swords and pistols, drive us below, do you see? And then we shan\u0027t be responsible if the \u0027Jeanne\u0027 does not heave to when ordered. \"Now let us make a bit of a scuffle; and will you fire a shot or two, gentlemen? They will be watching us with glasses from the shore, and will see that we make a fight for it.\" The sailors entered into the spirit of the thing, and a mock fight took place. The marquis and Rupert flashed their swords and fired their pistols, the crew being driven below, and the hatch put on above them. The fugitives had time to look around. Two boats laden with soldiers had put out, and were rowing after them. The marquis took the helm. \"The wind is freshening, and I think it will be a gale before morning, Rupert; but they are gaining upon us. I fear they will overtake us.\" \"I don\u0027t think they will get on board if they do, sir,\" Rupert said. \"Had not Adele better sit down on deck under shelter of the bulwarks? For they keep on firing, and a chance shot might hit her.\" \"It is no more likely to hit me than papa or you, Rupert.\" \"No more likely, my dear,\" her father said; \"but we must run the risk, and you need not. Besides, if we are anxious about you, we shall not be so well able to attend to what we have to do.\" Adele sat down by the bulwark, but presently said: \"If they come up close, papa, I might take the helm, if you show me which way to hold it. I could do it sitting down on deck, and you could help Rupert keep them off.\" \"Your proposal is a very good one, Adele, and it pleases me much to see you so cool and steady.\" The bullets were now whistling past the lugger, sometimes striking her sails, sometimes with a sharp tap hitting her hull or mast. \"We may as well sit down out of sight till the time comes for fighting, Rupert,\" the marquis said. \"Our standing up does no good, and only frightens this little girl.\" The firing ceased when they sat down, as it was clearly a waste of powder and ball continuing. Rupert from time to time looked over the stern. \"The first boat is not more than fifty yards behind, the other thirty or forty behind it. They gain on us very slowly, but I think they will catch us.\" \"Then we must do our best, Rupert. We have each our pistols, and I think we might begin to fire at the rowers.\" \"The pistols are not much good at that distance, sir. My idea is to let them come alongside; then I will heave that cask of water down into the boat, and there will be an end of it.\" \"That water cask!\" the marquis said. \"That is an eighteen gallon cask. It is as much as we can lift it, much less heave it through the air.\" \"I can do it, never fear,\" Rupert said. \"You forget my exercises at Loches, and as a miller\u0027s man. \"My only fear,\" he said in a low voice, \"is that they may shoot me as I come to the side with it. For that reason we had better begin to fire. I don\u0027t want to kill any of them, but just to draw their fire. Then, just as they come alongside put a cap and a cloak on that stick, and raise them suddenly. Any who are still loaded are sure to fire the instant it appears.\" The marquis nodded, and they began to fire over the stern, just raising their heads, and instantly lowering them. The boats again began to fire heavily. Not a man in the boats was hit, for neither of those in the lugger took aim. The men cheered, and rowed lustily, and soon the boat was within ten yards of the lugger, coming up to board at the side. Rupert went to the water barrel, and rolled it to the bulwarks at the point towards which the boat was making. The marquis stooped behind the bulwarks, a few paces distant, with the dummy. \"Now!\" Rupert said, stooping over the barrel, as the boat made a dash at the side. The marquis lifted the dummy, and five or six muskets were simultaneously discharged. Then a cry of amazement and horror arose, as Rupert, with the barrel poised above his head, reared himself above the bulwarks. He bent back to gain impetus, and then hurled the barrel into the boat as she came within a yard of the side of the lugger. There was a wild shout, a crash of timber, and in an instant the shattered boat was level with the water, and the men were holding on, or swimming for their lives. A minute later the other boat was on the spot, and the men were at work picking up their comrades. By the time all were in, she was only an inch or two out of the water, and there was only room for two men to pull; and the last thing those on board the lugger saw of her in the gathering darkness, she was slowly making her way towards shore. Now that all immediate danger was at an end, the marquis took the tiller, and Rupert lifted the hatchway. \"The captain and two of the crew may come on deck if they promise to behave well,\" he said. There was a shout of laughter, and all the sailors pressed up, eager to know how the pursuit had been shaken off. When Rupert told them simply that he had tossed one of the water barrels into one of the boats and staved it, the men refused to believe him; and it was not until he took one of the carronades, weighing some five hundred weight, from its carriage, and lifted it above his head as if to hurl it overboard, that their doubts were changed into astonishment. \"I suppose our danger is not over, captain?\" the marquis asked. \"No, we have the forts at the mouth of the river to pass, but we shall be there before it is light. They will send off a horseman when they get back to the town, but they will not be there for some time, and the wind is rising fast. I hope we shall be through before they get news of what has taken place. In any case, at the speed we shall be going through the water in another hour or two, no rowboat could stop us.\" \"I think, Captain Nicolay, it would be as well for you to keep only as many men as you absolutely want on deck, so that you can say we only allowed two or three up, and kept watch over you with loaded pistols.\" \"It would be better, perhaps,\" Maitre Nicolay said. \"There is sure to be a nice row about it, and it is always as well to have as few lies as possible to tell. \"Perhaps mademoiselle will like to go below. My cabin is ready for her, and I have told the boy to get supper for us all.\" The captain\u0027s prediction about the rising wind was correct, and in another hour the Belle Jeanne was tearing down the river at a rate of speed which, had the road from Nantes to the forts been no longer than that by water, would have rendered the chance of any horseman arriving before it slight indeed; but the river was winding, and although they calculated that they had gained an hour and a half start, Captain Nicolay acknowledged that it would be a close thing. Long ere the forts were reached Adele was fast asleep below, while her father and Rupert paced the deck anxiously. The night was not a dark one. The moon shone out at times bright and clear between the hurrying clouds. \"There are the forts,\" Maitre Nicolay said. \"The prospect is hopeful, for I do not see a light.\" The hands were all ordered below as they neared the forts, Maitre Nicolay himself taking the helm. All was dark and silent as they approached, and as La Belle Jeanne swept past them like a shadow, and all was still, a sigh of relief burst from the marquis and Rupert. Five minutes later the wind brought down the sound of a drum, a rocket soared into the air, and a minute or two later lights appeared in every embrasure of the forts on both sides. \"It has been a near thing,\" the marquis said; \"we have only won by five minutes.\" Three minutes later came a flash, followed by the roar of a gun, and almost at the same moment a shot struck the water, fifty yards ahead of them on their beam. \"We are nearly a mile away already,\" the captain said. \"It is fifty to one against their crippling us by this light, though they may knock some holes in our sails, and perhaps splinter our timbers a little. \"Ah! Just what I thought, here come the chasse marees,\" and he pointed to two vessels which had lain close under the shadow of the forts, and which were now hoisting sail. \"It is lucky that they are in there, instead of cruising outside, as usual. I suppose they saw the gale coming, and ran in for a quiet night.\" The forts were now hard at work, and the balls fell thickly around. One or two went through the sails, but none touched her hull or spars, and in another ten minutes she was so far away that the forts ceased firing. By this time, however, the chasse marees were under full sail, and were rapidly following in pursuit. La Belle Jeanne had, however, a start of fully a mile and a half. \"How do those craft sail with yours?\" Rupert asked. \"In ordinary weather the \u0027Jeanne\u0027 could beat them, though they are fast boats; but they are heavier than we are, and can carry their sail longer; besides, our being underhanded is against us. It will be a close race, monsieur. It will be too rough when we are fairly out for them to use their guns. But the best thing that can happen for us is that there may be an English cruiser not far off. I must have the hands up, and take in some sail; she will go just as fast, for she has too much on to be doing her best now we are in the open sea. \"Now, gentlemen, I advise you to lie down for an hour or two. I will call you if they gain much upon us.\" It was morning before the voyagers awoke, and made their way on deck. They looked round, but no sail was in sight, only an expanse of foaming sea and driving cloud. The captain was on deck. \"I suspect they have given it up and run back,\" he said; \"and no fools either. It is not weather for anyone to be out who has a choice in the matter. But the \u0027Jeanne\u0027 is a good sea boat, and has been out in worse weather than this. Not but that it is a big gale, but it is from the north, and the land shelters us a bit. If it keeps on like this, I shall lie-to a few hours. The sea will be tremendous when we get beyond Ushant.\" For three days the gale blew furiously, and the \"Jeanne\" lay-to. Then the storm broke, and the wind veered round to the south, and La Belle Jeanne flew along on her way towards England. It was at a point on the Hampshire coast, near Lymington, that she was to run her cargo; and on the fifth day after leaving the river she was within sight of land. They lowered their sails, and lay a few miles off land until nightfall, and then ran in again. Two lights on the shore, one above the other, told that the coast was clear; and the boats were quickly lowered. The marquis, who had come well provided with gold to meet all emergencies, handed over to Maitre Nicolay fifty pounds over the sum agreed on, and in a few minutes the travellers set foot on shore. Six days later, a post chaise brought them to the door of Windthorpe Chace, where Madame Holliday and the colonel stood on the steps to welcome Rupert\u0027s future wife. The very day after their return, Rupert mooted to the marquis the subject of an early marriage, but the latter said at once: \"I must first take a place for Adele to be married from. Mademoiselle Adele de Pignerolles must not be married like the daughter of a little bourgeois. Moreover, Rupert, it is already near the end of the year. In three months you will be setting out to join your regiment again. It would be cruel to Adele for you to marry her before the war is over, or until you at any rate have done with soldiering. You tell me that you have gone through enough, and that the next campaign shall be your last. At any rate you can obtain a year\u0027s leave after nine years of campaigning. So be it. When you return at the end of next year\u0027s campaign you shall find all ready, and I will answer for it that Adele will not keep you waiting. It is but a fortnight since you were affianced to each other. You can well wait the year.\" And so it was arranged, for Rupert himself saw that it would be cruel to expose Adele to the risk of being made a widow after a few weeks only of married life. The winter passed very quietly and happily. The marquis was always talking of taking a house, but Adele joined her voice with those of the others in saying that it would be cruel indeed for him to take her away from the Chace until it was time for Rupert to start for the war again. In the middle of March he received orders to join his regiment, as large numbers of recruits had been sent out, and every officer was required at his post. During the winter of 1708, Marlborough had laboured strenuously to obtain a peace which would satisfy all parties. Louis offered great concessions, which the duke urged strongly should be accepted; but the English and Dutch wanted terms so severe and humiliating that Louis would not accept them, and both sides prepared for a great final struggle. The King of France addressed an appeal to his people, telling them that he had offered to make the greatest possible sacrifices to obtain peace for them, but that the enemy demanded terms which would place France at their mercy. He therefore appealed to their patriotism to come forward to save the country. The people responded readily to the summons, and Marshal Villars took the field in the spring with 110,000 men, a force just equal to that of the allies. The French had taken up a position of such extraordinary strength, that it was hopeless for the allies to attempt to attack. His left wing was covered by the stream of Roubaix; his centre by the marsh of Cambriu; his right by the canal between Douai and Lille; and this naturally strong position had been so strengthened by artificial inundations, ditches, abattis, and earthworks, as to be practically impregnable. Marlborough and Eugene made, however, as if they would attack, and Villars called to him as many men as could be spared from the garrisons round. The allies then by a sudden night march arrived before Tournai, and at once commenced its investment. Tournai was an immensely strong town, but its garrison was weak. The heavy artillery was brought up from Ghent, and on the 6th of July the approaches were commenced; and on the 29th of that month, the governor, finding that the allies were gradually winning fort after fort, and that Villars made no movement to relieve him, surrendered the town, and retired into the citadel, which was then besieged. This was one of the most terrible sieges ever undertaken, for not only were the fortifications enormously strong, but beneath each bastion and outwork, and far extending beyond them, an immense number of galleries had been driven for mines. At all times soldiers, even the bravest, have found it difficult to withstand the panic brought about by the explosion of mines, and by that underground warfare in which bravery and strength were alike unavailing, and where the bravest as well as the most cowardly were liable at any moment to be blown into the air, or smothered underground. The dangers of this service, at all times great; were immensely aggravated by the extraordinary pains taken by those who had constructed the fortifications to prepare for subterranean warfare by the construction of galleries. The miners frequently met underground, breaking into each other\u0027s galleries. Sometimes the troops, mistaking friend for foe, fought with each other. Sometimes whole companies entered mines by mistake at the very moment that they were primed for explosion. They were often drowned, suffocated with smoke, or buried alive. Sometimes scores were blown into the air. It was not surprising that even the hearts of the allied troops were appalled at the new and extraordinary dangers which they had to face at the siege of Tournai; and the bravest were indeed exposed to the greatest danger. The first to mount a breach, to effect a lodgment in an outwork, to enter a newly discovered mine, was sure to perish. First there was a low rumbling noise, then the earth heaved, and whole companies were scattered with a frightful explosion. On the 5th of August, a sally made by the besieged was bravely repulsed, and the besiegers, pressing closely upon them, effected a lodgment; but immediately a mine was sprung, and 150 men blown into the air. On the 20th, the besieged blew down a wall which overhung a sap, and two officers and thirty-four soldiers were killed. On the 23rd a mine sixty feet long and twenty feet broad was discovered, just as a whole battalion of Hanoverian troops had taken up their place above it. All were congratulating themselves on the narrow escape, when a mine placed below that they had discovered exploded, burying all in the upper mine in the ruins. On the 25th, 300 men posted in a large mine which had been discovered, were similarly destroyed by the explosion of another mine below it; and the same night 100 men posted in the ditch were killed by a wall being blown out upon them. In resisting the attack upon one side of the fortress only, thirty-eight mines were sprung in twenty-six days, almost every one with fatal effect. It is no detriment to the courage of the troops to say, that they shrank appalled before such sudden and terrible a mode of warfare, and Marlborough and Eugene in person visited the trenches and braved the dangers in order to encourage the men. At last, on the 3rd of September, the garrison, reduced to 3000 men, surrendered; and were permitted to march out with the honours of war, and to return to France on the promise not to serve again. This siege cost the allies 5000 men. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3111/85675.html","bookId":933,"book":{"id":933,"title":"The Cornet of Horse","description":"简介： One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four--turn to your lady; one, two, three, four--now deep reverence.
