{"id":19854,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 19: The Evasion.","content":"Upon the ride from Versailles to Paris Rupert told the marquis what he had done and heard. \"It is bad news, Rupert. I will ride back this afternoon, when I have lodged you in Paris, and see Adele. If she objects--as I know she will object to this marriage--I shall respectfully protest. That any good will come of the protest I have no thought, but my protest may strengthen Adele\u0027s refusal, by showing that she has her father\u0027s approval. \"Adele will of course be treated coldly at first, then she will have pressure put upon her, then be ordered to choose between a convent and marriage. She will choose a convent. Now in some convents she could live quietly and happily, in others she would be persecuted. If she is sent to a convent chosen for her, it will be worse than a prison. Her life will be made a burden to her until she consents to obey the king\u0027s command. Therefore, my object will be to secure her retreat to a convent where she will be well treated and happy. But we will talk of this again.\" It was not until the following afternoon that the marquis returned from Versailles. \"I am off to the front again,\" he said. \"I had an audience with his Majesty this morning, and respectfully informed him of my daughter\u0027s incurable repugnance to the Duc de Carolan, and of her desire to remain single until at least she reached the age of twenty. His Majesty was pleased to say that girls\u0027 whims were matters to which it behoved not to pay any attention. He said, however, that for the present he would allow it to remain in abeyance, and that he begged me to see Adele, and to urge upon her the necessity for making up her mind to accept his Majesty\u0027s choice. He also said that the news from the army was bad, that good officers were urgently required there, and that it would be therefore advisable for me to repair at once to the front and again take the command of my regiment. He said that he wished me to take you with me as far as Lille, and that you should there take up your residence.\" \"Of course I will accompany you, sir,\" Rupert said; \"but I will withdraw my parole as soon as you hand me over, and take my chance of escaping.\" \"Yes, I should do that, Rupert. indeed, as you gave your parole to me, you can give it back to me now, if you choose. I will run the risk of some little anger on the part of the king, if you quit me on your way to Lille and make the best of your way to the frontier.\" \"No, I thank you,\" Rupert said. \"There can\u0027t be much difficulty in escaping from a town when one wants to do so; and it would do you an evil turn indeed to incense the king against you at the present time.\" The next morning, just as they were setting out, a lackey placed a note in Rupert\u0027s hands. \"I hear you are sent off to Lille. I have a cousin there, and have written to recommend you to his care. I will keep my promise, and let you know, if needs be, of what is happening to the young person we spoke of--Diana.\" Rupert wrote a few words of earnest thanks, and imitating the example set him, gave it unaddressed and unsigned to the lackey, with a handsome present to himself. On the way to Lille, the marquis told Rupert his plans for the withdrawal of Adele from court, and her concealment, should Louis insist on the marriage being pressed on. Arriving at Lille, Rupert was handed over to the governor, and having formally withdrawn his parole to make no effort to escape, he was assigned quarters in barracks, whence he was allowed to go into the town during daylight; being obliged, however, to attend at roll call at midday. The fortifications of the town were so strong and well guarded that it was supposed that the chance of escape was small. The following day the Marquis de Pignerolles took an affectionate leave of Rupert, and went on to join the army; and an hour or two later Captain Louis d\u0027Etamps, the cousin of whom Diana had written, called upon him, and placed himself at his service. His cousin had told him of the supposed crime for which Rupert had been sent away from court, and felt much sympathy with what she considered his hard treatment. Not only Louis d\u0027Etamps, but the French officers of the garrison, showed great kindness and attention to the English prisoner, for the Duke of Marlborough had treated the French officers who fell into his hands at Ramilies with such kindness and courtesy, that the French were glad to have an opportunity of reciprocating the treatment when the chance fell in their way. Late in the autumn, the Marquis de Pignerolles was brought back to Lille seriously wounded in one of the last skirmishes of the campaign. Rupert spent all the time he was allowed to be out of barracks at his friend\u0027s quarters. The wound was not considered dangerous, but it would keep the marquis a prisoner to his room for weeks. A few days after the marquis was brought in, Louis d\u0027Etamps came into Rupert\u0027s room early in the morning. \"I have a note for you from my fair cousin,\" he said. \"It must be something particular, for she has sent a special messenger with a letter to me, and on opening it I find only a line asking me to give you the enclosed instantly.\" Rupert opened the latter from Diana d\u0027Etamps; it was as follows: \"Adele has been ordered to marry the Duc de Carolan on the 15th. Unless she consents, she is on the 14th to be sent to the nunnery of Saint Marie, the strictest in France, where they will somehow or other wring consent from her before many weeks are over. They have done so in scores of cases like hers. I promised to tell you, and I have done so. But I don\u0027t see that anything can be done. I hear Monsieur le Marquis is badly wounded, but even were he here, he could do nothing. The king is resolute. The Duc de Carolan has just given 200,000 crowns towards the expenses of the war.\" \"May I see?\" Louis d\u0027Etamps said, for the young men were now fast friends. Rupert handed him the note. \"What can you do, my poor boy?\" he said. \"I will go and see the marquis, and let you know afterwards,\" Rupert said. \"I shall do something, you may be sure.\" \"If you do, you will want to escape from Lille. I will see about the arrangements for that. There is no time to be lost. It is the 10th today.\" Rupert\u0027s conversation with the Marquis de Pignerolles was long and interesting. The marquis chafed at being confined to a sick bed and permitting Rupert to run the risk, which was immense, of the attempt alone. However, as he could not move, and as Rupert was determined to do something, the marquis entered into all the plans he had drawn up, and intended to follow when such an emergency occurred. He gave him a letter for Adele, and then they parted. At his room Rupert found Louis. \"Quick,\" he said, \"there is no time to lose. At ten o\u0027clock a convoy of wounded leave for Paris. The doctor in charge is a friend of mine and a capital fellow. I have just seen him. All is arranged. Come along to my quarters, they are on the line that the convoy goes to the gate. Jump in bed, then I will bandage up your head with plaisters so that not more than space to see and breathe out of will be left. When the convoy arrives at the door, he will have an empty litter ready, will bring up four men who will lift you in, supposing you to be a wounded French officer, carry you down, and off you go with the convoy, not a soul save the doctor, you, and I, the wiser. He has got a pass to leave the city with forty-eight sick and ten soldiers, and he has only to tell one of those marked to go that he is not well enough to be moved, and will go with the next convoy. The messenger who brought the letter has started again, and has taken with him a led horse of mine. He will be at the hostelry of Henri the 4th, at the place where you will stop tonight. He will not know who you are, I have told him that a friend of mine will call for the horse, which I had promised to send him. \"When you halt for the night, the doctor will order you to be carried into his own room. You will find two or three suits of clothes in the litter, a lackey\u0027s suit of our livery which may be useful, a country gentleman\u0027s, and one of mine. When you are alone with the doctor and all is safe, get up, put on the country gentleman\u0027s suit, say goodbye to him and go straight to the stables at the Henri the 4th. You are the Sire de Nadar. I have written a note here, telling you the horse will be there and you are to fetch it--here it is. The messenger will know my seal.\" \"I am indeed obliged to you,\" Rupert said, \"you have thought of everything; but how will the doctor explain my not being forthcoming in the morning?\" \"Oh, he will arrange that easily enough. The soldiers will all sleep soundly enough after this march; besides, they will not, in all probability, be near his quarters, so he will only have to say that he found you were too ill to continue the journey, and had therefore had you carried to a confrere of his. You must be under no fear, Rupert, of any evil consequences to anyone, for no one will ever connect you with the convoy. You will be missed at roll call, but that will go for nothing. When you are absent again at six o\u0027clock, you will be reported as missing. Then it will be supposed that you are hid in the city, and a sharp watch will be set at the gates; but after a few days it will be supposed that you have either got over the walls, or that you have gone out disguised as a peasant. A prisoner of war more or less makes but little difference, and there will never be any fuss about it.\" Soon after dusk on the evening of the 13th of October, Adele de Pignerolles was sitting alone in a large room in the house of Madame de Soissons. A wood fire was blazing, and even in that doubtful light it might have been seen that the girl\u0027s eyes were swollen with crying. She was not crying now, but was looking into the fire with a set, determined look in her face. \"I don\u0027t care,\" she said; \"they may kill me at Saint Marie, but I will never say yes. Oh, if papa were but here.\" At that moment there was a knock at the door, and a bright-looking waiting maid entered. \"A note, mademoiselle, from Mademoiselle d\u0027Etamps--and mademoiselle,\" and she put her finger mysteriously to her lips, \"it is a new lackey has brought it. I told him to come again in ten minutes for an answer; for I thought it better he should not come in to be looked at by Francois and Jules.\" \"Why not, Margot?\" Adele asked in great surprise. \"Because, mademoiselle, he seemed to me--I may be wrong, you know--but he seemed to me very, very like--\" \"Like whom, Margot? How mysterious you are.\" \"Like the English officer,\" Margot said, with an arch nod. Adele leapt to her feet. \"You must be mad, Margot. There, light a candle.\" But without waiting, Adele knelt down close to the fire, and broke open the letter. A flush, even ruddier than that given by the fire, mounted over her face. \"It is him, Margot. He has come from my father. Now we are to do what I told you about. We are to go off tonight under his charge, to your mother\u0027s, my dear old nurse, and there I am to live with you, and be as your cousin, till papa can get me out of the country.\" \"And is the young officer to live there till the marquis comes?\" Margot asked, slyly. \"He might pass as another cousin, mademoiselle.\" \"How foolish you are, Margot, and this is no time for folly. But listen. My father says, \u0027Rupert will be in the street round the corner, with three horses, at eleven o\u0027clock. You and Margot are to be dressed in the boys\u0027 clothes that I bade you prepare. Take in bundles two of Margot\u0027s dresses. Do not be afraid to trust yourself with Rupert Holliday. Regard him as a brother; he has all my confidence and trust.\u0027\" \"We must remember that,\" Margot said. \"Remember what, Margot?\" \"Only that you are to regard him as a brother, mademoiselle.\" \"Margot, Margot, I am surprised at you, joking like a child when we have a terrible business before us. But indeed I feel so happy at the thought of escape from that terrible convent, that I could joke like a child also.\" \"You had better write a line for him, mademoiselle. It was from chance that I happened to be in the hall when he rang; and we don\u0027t want him to come in to be stared at by Francois while you write an answer.\" Quickly Adele sat down at a table, and wrote: \"At the hour and place named, expect us--Yours, trustfully, Adele.\" As the clock struck eleven two slight figures stole noiselessly out of the garden gate of Madame de Soissons\u0027 house at Versailles. The town was hushed in sleep, and not a sound was moving in the street. They carried bundles with them, and walked with rapid steps to a small lane which led off the street by the side of the garden wall. It was quite dark, and they could see nothing, but a voice said: \"Adele!\" \"Rupert!\" one of the figures answered, in shy, trembling tones. \"Please stay where you are,\" Rupert said. \"It is lighter in the street.\" The horses were led forth noiselessly, for Rupert had fastened cloths round their feet, to prevent the iron shoes sounding on the round pebbles which paved the streets. Not a word was said. There was a warm clasp of the hand, and Rupert lifted Adele into the saddle. Margot climbed into another, and the three rode rapidly down the streets. Not a word was spoken until they were in the open country. \"Thank God, you are safe thus far, Adele. The last time I helped you on to a horse was the day you went out to see my hawk kill a heron.\" \"Oh, Rupert,\" the girl said, \"it seems like a dream. But please do not let us talk yet about ourselves. Tell me about Papa. How is he?\" Rupert told her; and gradually as they talked the excitement and agitation passed off. \"And where did you get the horses, Rupert?\" \"The one I am riding is Louis d\u0027Etamps\u0027,\" he said, \"the others are your father\u0027s. I brought orders from him to his steward in Paris, that two of his best horses were to be sent this morning to a stable in Versailles, and left there, and that a person with an order from him would call for them.\" \"I cannot see you in the least. Are you dressed as Monsieur d\u0027Etamps\u0027 lackey still?\" \"No, I am now a quiet country gentleman, riding down from Paris with my two sons, who have been up with me to see their aunt who lives in the Rue du Tempe.\" \"Talk French, please, Rupert. Margot will understand then; and she is so brave and good, and shares my danger, so she ought to be as one of us.\" Adele\u0027s spirits rose as they got farther from Versailles, and they talked and laughed cheerfully, but in low tones. Three miles from Versailles, as they rode past a crossroad, two mounted men dashed out suddenly. \"Stand, in the king\u0027s name! Who are you?\" \"We are travellers,\" Rupert said, quietly, \"and go where we will. Who are you?\" \"We are guards of the court, and we must know who you are before we suffer you to pass. None ride at night near Versailles but with a pass.\" \"I am an exception then,\" Rupert said, \"and I advise you not to interfere with us;\" and he urged his horse a few feet in advance of his companions. One of the horsemen seized his bridle, while another drew a pistol. Rupert\u0027s sword leaped from its scabbard and cut down the man who held the rein. The other fired, but Rupert threw himself forward on the horse\u0027s neck and the bullet whizzed over his head. He rode at the garde, and with a heavy blow with the pommel of the sword struck him senseless from his horse. \"Now,\" he said to Adele, \"we can ride on again. You are not frightened, I hope?\" \"Not so frightened as I was the first time you drew sword in my behalf,\" the girl said; \"but it is very dreadful. Are they killed, Rupert?\" \"Not a bit of it,\" Rupert said; \"one has got a gash on the head which will cost him a crown in plaister, the other may have lost some teeth. It would have been wise to have killed them, for their tale in the morning is likely to be regarded as throwing some light upon your disappearance; but I could not kill men who were only doing their duty. At any rate we have twelve hours\u0027 start, even if they take up the clue and pursue us on this line tomorrow. \"It is about ten miles this side of Poitiers that your mother lives, is it not, Margot?\" \"Yes, Monsieur Rupert. How surprised she will be at my arrival with my cousins.\" \"Oh, we are both your cousins, are we, Margot?\" \"Mademoiselle Adele is to pass as my cousin, monsieur, and I suppose you must be either another cousin, or else her brother.\" \"Margot,\" Adele said, \"you chatter too much.\" \"Do I, mademoiselle? It is better than riding through the darkness without speaking. I was very glad when the cloths were off the horses\u0027 feet, for we seemed like a party of ghosts.\" \"How long shall we be getting there?\" Adele asked, presently. \"Six days, if we do it all with the same horses,\" Rupert said; \"and I am afraid to hire horses and leave them on the way, as it would look as if we were pressed for time. No, for today we are safe--but for today only. Messengers will be sent in all directions with orders for our arrest. They will take fresh relays of horses; and really our only hope is in disguise. I propose that we go the first stage without halting as far as our horses will carry us. I think we can get to Orleans. There we will put them up, and take rooms. Then Margot must slip out in her own dress and buy two peasant girls\u0027 attire, and I will pick up at some dealer in old clothes a suit which will enable me to pass as a wounded soldier making his way home. Then we will strike off from the main road and follow the lanes and get on some other road. They will inquire all along the road and will hear of a gentleman and two youths, and will for a while have that in their minds. No one will particularly notice us, and we shall get into Tours safely enough. \"We must never enter a house or town together, for they will be on the lookout for three people, and neither a soldier with his head bound up, nor two peasant girls, will attract attention. At Tours I will get a farmer\u0027s dress, and will buy a horse and cart, and a load of hay, and will pick you up outside the town. You can get on the hay, and can cover yourselves over if you see any horsemen in pursuit. After that it will be all easy work.\" \"Why could you not get the cart at Orleans, Rupert?\" Adele asked. \"I might,\" he said; \"but I think that the extra change would be best, as they would then have no clue whatever to follow. They will trace us to Orleans, and you may be sure that there will be a hot hue and cry, and it may be that the fact of a horse and cart having been sold would come out. They will not know whether we have made east, west, or south from there, so there will be a far less active search at Tours than there will at Orleans.\" So the journey was carried out, and without any serious adventure; although with a great many slight alarms, and some narrow escapes of detection, which cannot be here detailed. The party arrived at the spot where the lane leading to the little farm occupied by Margot\u0027s mother left the main road. Here they parted, the girls taking their bundles, and starting to trudge the last few miles on foot. Margot discreetly went on a little ahead, to give her mistress the opportunity of speaking to Rupert alone, but she need not have done so, for all that Rupert said was: \"I have been in the light of your brother this time, Adele, as your father gave you into my charge. If I ever come again, dear, it will be different.\" \"You are very good, Rupert. Goodbye;\" and with a wave of the hand she ran after Margot; while Rupert, mounting the cart, drove on into Poitiers. Here he sold his load of hay to a stable keeper, drove a mile or two out of the town, entered a wood, and then took the horse out of the cart, and leaving the latter in a spot where, according to all appearances, it was not likely to be seen for months, drove the horse still further into the wood, and, placing a pistol to its head, shot it dead. Then he renewed his disguise as a soldier, but this time dispensed with the greater part of his bandages, and set out on his return, in high spirits at having so successfully performed his journey. He pursued his journey as far back as Blois without the slightest interruption, but here his tramp came to a sudden termination. Secure in the excellence of his French, Rupert had attempted no disguise as to his face beyond such as was given by a strip of plaister, running from the upper lip to the temple. He strode gaily along, sometimes walking alone, sometimes joining some other wayfarer, telling every one that he was from Bordeaux, where he had been to see his parents, and get cured of a sabre cut. As he passed through the town of Blois, Rupert suddenly came upon a group of horsemen. Saluting as he passed--for in those days in France no one of inferior rank passed one of the upper classes without uncovering--he went steadily on. \"That is a proper looking fellow,\" one of the party said, looking after him. \"By our Lady,\" exclaimed another, \"I believe I have seen that head and shoulders before. Yes, I feel sure. \"Gentlemen, we have made a prize. Unless I am greatly mistaken, this is the villainous Englishman who it is believed aided that malapert young lady to escape.\" In another moment Rupert was surrounded. His hat was knocked off; and the Duc de Carolan, for it was he, exclaimed in delight: \"I thought that I could not be mistaken. It is himself.\" Rupert attempted no resistance, for alone and on foot it would have been hopeless. The governor of the royal castle of Blois was one of the party, and Rupert found himself in another ten minutes standing, with guards on each side of him, before a table in the governor\u0027s room, with the governor and the Duc de Carolan sitting as judges before him. \"I have nothing to say,\" Rupert said, quietly. \"I escaped from Lille because I had been, as I deemed it, unworthily treated in Paris. I had withdrawn my parole, and was therefore free to escape if I could. I did escape, but finding the frontier swarmed with French troops, I thought it safer to make for central France, where a wayfarer would not be looked upon as suspiciously as in the north. Here I am. I decline to answer any further questions. \"As to the lady of whom you question me, I rejoice to find, by the drift of your questions, that she has withdrawn herself from the persecution which she suffered, and has escaped being forced into marriage with a man she once described in my hearing as an ape in the costume of the day.\" \"And that is all you will say, prisoner?\" the governor asked, while the Duc de Carolan gave an exclamation of fury. \"That is all, sir; and I would urge, that as an English officer I am entitled to fair and honourable treatment; for although I might have been shot in the act of trying to escape from prison, it is the rule that an escaping prisoner caught afterwards, as I am, should have fair treatment, although his imprisonment should be stricter and more secure than before. \"As to the other matter, there cannot be, I am assured, even a tittle of evidence to connect me with the event you mention. As far as I hear from you, I escaped on the 10th from Lille, which date is indeed accurate. Three days later Mademoiselle de Pignerolles left Versailles. The connection between the two events does not appear in any way clear to me.\" \"It may or it may not be,\" the governor said. \"However, my duty is clear, to keep you here in safe ward until I receive his Majesty\u0027s orders.\" Four days later the royal order came. Rupert was to be taken to the dreaded fortress prison of Loches, a place from which not one in a hundred of those who entered in ever came from alive.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3111/85668.html","bookId":933,"book":{"id":933,"title":"The Cornet of Horse","description":"简介： One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four--turn to your lady; one, two, three, four--now deep reverence.
