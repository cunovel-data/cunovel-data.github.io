{"id":19852,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17: A Prisoner of War.","content":"In the brilliant results which arose from the victory at Ramilies, Rupert Holliday had no share. The 5th dragoons formed part of the cavalry force which, when the battle was over, pursued the broken French cavalry to the gates of Hochstad. In the pursuit, along a road encumbered with deserted waggons, tumbrels, and guns, the pursuers after nightfall became almost as much broken up as the pursued. Rupert\u0027s horse towards the end of the pursuit went dead lame, and he dismounted in order to see if he could do anything to its hoof. He found a sharp stone tightly jammed in the shoe, and was struggling to get this out when the troop again moved forward. Not doubting that he would overtake them in a minute or two, and fearing that unless his horse was relieved of the stone it would become so lame that it would not be able to carry him back, Rupert hammered away at it with a large boulder from the road. It was a longer job than he had anticipated, and five minutes elapsed before he succeeded in getting the stone out, and then, mounting his horse, he rode briskly forward. Presently he came to a point where the road forked. He drew rein and listened, and thought he heard the tramping of horse on the road that led to the left. As he rode on the noise became louder, and in another five minutes he came up to the troop. It was quite dark, and riding past the men, he made his way to the head of the column. \"I have had an awful bother in getting rid of that stone,\" he said, as he rode up to the leader. \"I began to think that I should lose you altogether. It is quite a chance I took this road.\" \"An unfortunate chance, sir, for you. A fortunate one for us,\" the officer he addressed said in English, but with a strong accent, \"since you are our prisoner,\" and as he spoke he laid his hand on Rupert\u0027s bridle. Rupert gave an exclamation of horror at finding the mistake that he had made, but he saw at once that resistance would be useless. \"Je me rends, monsieur. But what horrible luck.\" The three French officers at the head of the troop burst into a laugh. \"Monsieur,\" the one who had first spoken said, now in his native tongue, \"we are indebted to you, for you have made us laugh, and heaven knows we have had little enough to laugh at today. But how came you here? Your cavalry have taken the upper road. We were drawn up to make a last charge, when we heard them turn off that way; and were, I can tell you, glad enough to get off without more fighting. We have had enough of it for one day.\" As the speaker proceeded, Rupert became more and more convinced that he knew the voice; and the fact that the speaker was acquainted with English, the more convinced him that he was right. \"I stopped to get rid of a stone in my horse\u0027s hoof,\" he said. \"If I had only had a fight for it I should not have minded, but not even to have the pleasure of exchanging a pass or two with one of you gentlemen is hard indeed.\" \"It is just as well that you did not,\" one of the officers said, \"for Monsieur le Marquis de Pignerolles is probably the best swordsman in our army.\" \"The Marquis de Pignerolles,\" Rupert said, courteously; \"it would have been a pleasure to have crossed swords with him, but scarcely fair, for he knows already that he is not a match for me.\" \"What!\" exclaimed the marquis himself and the two officers, in astonishment. \"You are pleased to joke, sir,\" the marquis said haughtily. \"Not at all,\" Rupert said, gravely. \"You have met two persons who were your match. You remember Monsieur Dalboy?\" \"Dalboy!\" the marquis said. \"Surely, surely, le Maitre Dalboy, yet--?\" \"No, I am assuredly not Monsieur Dalboy,\" Rupert said. \"And the other?\" The marquis reined in his horse suddenly. \"What!\" he said, \"you are--?\" \"Rupert Holliday, my dear Monsieur Dessin.\" \"My dear, dear lad,\" the marquis exclaimed. \"What pleasure! What delight!\" and drawing his horse by the side of Rupert he embraced him with affection. \"My friends,\" he said to the other officers, who were naturally astonished at this sudden recognition between their prisoner and their colonel, \"gentlemen, this English officer is my very dear friend. What kindness have I not received from his grandfather during my time of exile! While to himself I am deeply indebted. \"What a fortunate chance, that if you were to have the bad luck to be made prisoner, you should fall into my hands of all men. I wish that I could let you go, but you know--\" \"Of course, of course,\" Rupert said. \"Really I am hardly sorry, since it has brought us together again.\" \"Did you recognize my name?\" the marquis said. \"No indeed,\" Rupert answered. \"The letter which, we doubted not, that you wrote to my grandfather, never came to hand, and we never knew what Monsieur Dessin\u0027s real name was, so that Colonel Holliday did not know to whom to write in France.\" \"I wrote twice,\" the marquis said, \"but I guessed that the letters had never arrived. And the good gentleman your grandfather, he is still alive and well?\" \"As well as ever,\" Rupert said, \"and will be delighted to hear of you. \"Mademoiselle is well, I trust?\" \"Quite well, and quite a belle at the court, I can assure you,\" the marquis said. \"But there are the gates of Louvain. You will, of course, give me your parole not to try to escape, and then you can come straight to my quarters with me, and I need not report you for a day or so. We shall be in fearful confusion tonight, for half our army is crowding in here, and every one must shift for himself. \"Peste! What a beating you have given us! That Marlborough of yours is terrible. \"I know some people here,\" he said, turning to the officers. \"They will take us four in, and the men must picket their horses in the courtyard and street, and lie down in their cloaks. Tomorrow we will see what is to be done, and how many have escaped from the terrible debacle.\" The streets of Louvain were crowded with fugitives, some of them had thrown themselves down by the sidewalks, utterly exhausted; others mingled with the anxious townsmen, and related the incidents of the disastrous day; while the horses stood, with drooping heads, huddled together along the middle of the street. It was only by making long detours that the Marquis de Pignerolles reached the house of which he was in search. Late as was the hour the inmates were up, for the excitement at Louvain was so great that no one had thought of going to bed; and Monsieur Cardol, his wife and family, did all in their power for their guests. Supper was quickly laid for the four gentlemen; a barrel of wine was broached for the troops, and what provisions were in the house were handed over to them. \"Now let us look at you,\" the Marquis de Pignerolles said, as they entered the brightly lighted room. \"Ah, you are a man now; but your face has little changed--scarcely at all.\" \"I am scarcely a man yet,\" Rupert said, laughing. \"I am just twenty now; it is rather more than four years since we parted, without even saying goodbye.\" \"Yes, indeed, Rupert. I tried to do you a good turn in the matter of the Brownlows. I hope it succeeded.\" \"It did indeed,\" Rupert said. \"We are indeed indebted to you for your intervention then. You saved my lady mother from a wretched marriage, and you saved for me the lands of Windthorpe Chace.\" \"Ah, I am glad it came off well. But I am your debtor still, mind that; and always shall be. And now to supper. First, though, I must introduce you formally to my comrades, and to our host and hostess, and their pretty daughters.\" Very much surprised were the latter when they heard that the handsome young officer was an Englishman and a prisoner. \"He does not look very terrible, does he, this curly-haired young fellow, mademoiselles; but he is one of those terrible horse which have broken the cavalry of the Maison du Roi today, and scattered the chivalry of France. As to himself, he is a Rustium, a Bobadil, if he has, as I doubt not, kept up his practice--\" and he looked at Rupert, who nodded smilingly; for he had indeed, during the four years he had been in Flanders, not only practised assiduously in the regimental fencing salles, but had attended all the schools kept by the best Spanish, Italian, and German teachers, keeping himself in practice, and acquiring a fresh pass here, an ingenious defence there, and ever improving--\"The first swordsman in France would run a chance against this good-tempered-looking lad with his blue eyes.\" The French girls opened their eyes in astonishment, but they were not quite sure whether the marquis was not making fun of them. \"Parbleu!\" the two officers exclaimed. \"You are not in earnest surely, marquis?\" \"I am, indeed, gentlemen; and I can claim some share of the merit, for I taught him myself; and before he was sixteen he was a better swordsman than I was; and as he loved the art, he will have gone on improving, and must be miraculous. \"By the way,\" he said, suddenly, \"there was a story went through Flanders near four years back of the best swordsman in the German army being killed by a mere boy in an English regiment, and I said then, I think that this must be my pupil. Was it so?\" \"It was,\" Rupert said. \"It was a painful affair; but I was forced into it.\" \"Make no excuse, I beg,\" the marquis said, laughing. \"Now, young ladies, let us to supper; but beware of this prisoner of war, for if he is only half as formidable with his eyes as with his wrist, it is all up with your poor hearts.\" Then, with much merriment, the four officers sat down to table, their host and hostess joining for company, and the young ladies acting as attendants. No one would have guessed that three of the party had formed part of an army which that day had been utterly routed, or that the other was their prisoner; but the temperament of the French enables them to recover speedily from misfortune; and although they had been dull and gloomy enough until Rupert so suddenly fell into their hands, the happy accident of his being known to their colonel, and the pleasure and excitement caused by the meeting, sufficed to put them in high spirits again, especially as their own corps had suffered but slightly in the action, having been in reserve on the left, and never engaged except in a few charges to cover the retreat. When the battle was alluded to, the brows of the French officers clouded, and they denounced in angry terms the fatal blunder of the marshal of weakening his centre to strengthen the left against a feigned attack. But the subject soon changed again, for, as the marquis said, \"It would be quite time to talk it over tomorrow, when they would know who had fallen, and what were the losses;\" for from their position on the left, they had little idea of the terrible havoc which had been made among the best blood in France. Long after all the others had retired, the marquis and Rupert sat together talking over old times. Rupert learned that even before he had left the Chace the marquis had received news that the order of banishment, which the king had passed against him because he had ventured to speak in public in terms of indignation at the wholesale persecution of the Protestants, had been rescinded; and that the estates, which had also been confiscated, were restored. The Protestant persecutions had become things of the past, the greater portion of the French Protestants having fled the country; and the powerful friends of De Pignerolles had never ceased to interest themselves in his favour. The king, too, was in need of experienced soldiers for the war which was about to break out; and lastly, and by the tone in which his friend spoke Rupert saw that the subject was rather a sore one, his Majesty wished to have Adele near the court. \"Mademoiselle Dessin!\" Rupert said, in astonishment. \"Well, not exactly Mademoiselle Dessin,\" the marquis said, smiling, \"but la Marquise Adele de Pignerolles, who is by her mother\u0027s side--she was a Montmorency--one of the richest heiresses in France, and as inheriting those lands, a royal ward, although I, her father, am alive.\" \"But even so,\" Rupert said, \"what can his Majesty wish to have her at court for?\" \"Because, as a very rich heiress, and as a very pretty one, her hand is a valuable prize, and his Majesty may well intend it as a reward to some courtier of high merit.\" \"Oh, Monsieur Dessin!\" Rupert said, earnestly; \"surely you do not mean that!\" \"I am sorry to say that I do, Master Rupert. The Grand Monarque is not in the habit of considering such trifles as hearts or inclinations in the bestowal of his royal wards; and although it is a sort of treason to say so, I would rather be back in England, or have Adele to myself, and be able to give her to some worthy man whom she might love, than to see her hand held out as a prize of the courtiers of Versailles. I have lived long enough in England to have got some of your English notions, that a woman ought at least to have the right of refusal.\" Rupert said nothing, but he felt sorry and full of pity at the thought of the young girl he remembered so well being bestowed as a sort of royal gift upon some courtier, quite irrespective of the dictates of her own heart. After sitting some time in silence, the marquis changed the subject suddenly. \"I am afraid you will not be exchanged before next winter, Rupert. There are, no doubt, plenty of prisoners in Marlborough\u0027s hands, but the campaign is sure to be a stirring and rapid one after this defeat. He will strike heavy blows, and we shall be doing our best to avoid them. It will not be until the fighting is over that the negotiations for the exchange of prisoners will begin.\" The next morning the Marquis de Pignerolles went off early to the headquarters of the commandant; and Rupert remained chatting with the family of his host. Two hours later he returned. \"Things are worse than I even feared,\" he said; \"the royal guards are almost destroyed, and the destruction wrought in all our noble families is terrible. It is impossible to estimate our total loss at present, but it is put down at 20,000, including prisoners. In fact, as an army it has almost ceased to exist; and your Marlborough will be able to besiege the fortresses of Flanders as he likes. There has been a council of all the general officers here this morning. I am to carry some dispatches to Versailles--not altogether a pleasant business, but some one must do it, and of course he will have heard the main incidents direct from Villeroi. I leave at noon, Rupert, and you will accompany me, unless indeed you would prefer remaining here on the chance of getting an earlier exchange.\" Rupert naturally declared at once for the journey to Paris. Officers on parole were in those days treated with great courtesy, especially if they happened to have a powerful friend. He therefore looked forward to a pleasant stay in Paris, and to a renewal of his acquaintance with Adele, and to a sight of the glories of Versailles, which, under Louis XIV, was the gayest, the most intellectual, and the most distinguished court of Europe. Louis XIV could not be termed a good man, but he was unquestionably a great king. He did much for France, whose greatness and power he strove to increase; and yet it was in no slight degree owing to his policy that, seventy years later, a tempest was to burst out in France, which was to sweep away the nobility and the crown itself; which was to deluge the soil of France with its best blood, to carry war through Europe, and to end at last by the prostration of France beneath the feet of the nations to whom she had been a scourge. The tremendous efforts made by Louis XIV to maintain the Spanish succession, which he had secured for France; the draining of the land of men; and the impoverishing of the nobles, who hesitated at no sacrifices and efforts to enable the country to make head against its foes, exhausted the land; while the immense extravagance of the splendid court in the midst of an impoverished land, ruined not only by war, but by the destruction of its trade, by the exile of the best and most industrious of its people on account of their religion, caused a deep and widespread discontent throughout the towns and country of France. Three hours later, Rupert set out with the Marquis of Pignerolles and two troopers. After two days ride through Belgium they reached Valenciennes, where the uniform of Rupert, in the scarlet and bright cuirass of the British dragoons, excited much attention, for British prisoners were rare in France. On the evening of the fifth day they reached Paris, where they rode to the mansion of the marquis. Rupert was aware that he would not see Adele, who was, her father had told him, at Versailles, under the care of Madame de Soissons, one of the ladies of the court. Rupert was told to consider himself at home; and then the marquis rode on to Versailles. \"I saw his Majesty last night,\" he told Rupert when he returned next morning, \"and he was very gracious. I hear that even Brousac, who brought the news of our defeat, was kindly received. I am told that he feels the cutting up of his guards very much. A grand entertainment, which was to have taken place this week, has been postponed, and there will be no regular fetes this autumn. I told his Majesty that I had brought you with me on parole, and the manner of your capture. He charged me to make the time pass pleasantly for you, and to bring you down to Versailles, and to present you at the evening reception. \"We must get tailors to work at once, Rupert, for although you must of course appear in uniform, that somewhat war-stained coat of yours is scarcely fit for the most punctilious court in Europe. However, as they will have this coat for a model, the tailors will soon fashion you a suit which would pass muster as your uniform before Marlborough himself. \"I saw Adele, and told her I had brought an English officer, who had galloped in the darkness into our ranks, as a prisoner. I did not mention your name. It will be amusing to see if she recognizes you. She was quite indignant at my taking you prisoner, and said that she thought soldiers ought not to take advantage of an accident of that kind. In fact, although Adele, as I tell her, is very French at heart, the five years she passed in Derby have left a deep impression upon her. She was very happy at school. Every one, as she says, was kind to her; and the result is, that although she rejoices over our victories in Italy and Germany, she talks very little about the Flanders campaign; about which, by the way, were she even as French as possible, there would not be anything very pleasant to say.\" Rupert was at once furnished from the wardrobe of the marquis with clothes of all kinds, and as they were about the same height--although Rupert was somewhat broader and heavier--the things fitted well, and Rupert was able to go about Paris, without being an object of observation and curiosity by the people. Rupert was somewhat disappointed in Paris. Its streets were narrower than those of London, and although the public buildings were fine, the Louvre especially being infinitely grander than the Palace of Saint James, there was not anything like the bustle and rush of business which had struck Rupert so much on his arrival in London. Upon arriving at Versailles, however, Rupert was struck with wonder. Nothing that he had seen could compare with the stately glories of Versailles, which was then the real capital of France. A wing of the magnificent palace was set apart for the reception of the nobles and military men whose business brought them for short periods to the court, and here apartments had been assigned to the marquis. The clothes had already been sent down by mounted lackeys, and Rupert was soon in full uniform again, the cuirass alone being laid aside. The laced scarlet coat, and the other items of attire, were strictly in accordance with the somewhat lax regulations as to the dress of an officer of dragoons; but the lace cravat falling in front, and the dress lace ruffles of the wrists, were certainly more ample than the Duke of Marlborough might have considered fit for strict regimental attire. But indeed there was little rule as to dress in those early days of a regular British army. Rupert\u0027s knee breeches were of white satin, and his waistcoat of thick brocaded silk of a delicate drab ground. Standing as he did some six feet high, with broad shoulders, and a merry, good-tempered face, with brown curls falling on his lace collar, the young lieutenant was as fine a looking specimen of a well-grown Englishman as could be desired. \"Ma foi!\" the marquis said, when he came in in full dress to see if Rupert was ready, \"we shall have the ladies of the court setting their caps at you, and I must hasten to warn my countrymen of your skill with the rapier, or you will be engaged in a dozen affairs of honour before you have been here as many days. \"No,\" he said, laughing at Rupert\u0027s gestures of dislike to duelling, \"his gracious Majesty has strictly forbidden all duelling, and--well, I will not say that there is none of it, but it goes on behind the scenes, for exile from court is the least punishment, and in some cases rigorous imprisonment when any special protege of the king has been wounded. \"And now, Rupert, it is time to be off. The time for gathering in the antechamber is at hand. By the way, I have said nothing to the king of our former knowledge of each other. There were reasons why it was better not to mention the fact.\" Rupert nodded as he buckled on his sword and prepared to accompany his friend. Along stately corridors and broad galleries, whose magnificence astonished and delighted Rupert, they made their way until they reached the king\u0027s antechamber. Here were assembled a large number of gentlemen, dressed in the extreme of fashion, some of whom saluted the marquis, and begged particulars of him concerning the late battles; for in those days news travelled slowly, newspapers were scarcely in existence, special correspondents were a race of men undreamed of. To each of those who accosted him the marquis presented Rupert, who was soon chatting as if at Saint James\u0027s instead of Versailles. In Flanders he had found that all the better classes spoke French, which was also used as the principal medium of communication between the officers of that many-tongued body the allied army, consequently he spoke it as fluently and well as he had done as a lad. Presently the great door at the end of the antechamber was thrown back, and the assembled courtiers fell back on either side. Then one of the officers of the court entered, crying, \"The king, gentlemen, the king!\" And then Louis himself, followed by some of the highest officers of state, entered. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3111/85666.html","bookId":933,"book":{"id":933,"title":"The Cornet of Horse","description":"简介： One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four--turn to your lady; one, two, three, four--now deep reverence.
