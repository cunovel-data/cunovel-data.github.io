{"id":19849,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14: The Riot at Dort.","content":"The Duke of Marlborough lost no time in utilizing the advantages gained by the victory of Blenheim. He at once raised the siege of Ingoldstadt, which, when all the country was in his power, must sooner or later surrender, and detached a portion of the force which had been there engaged to besiege Ulm, an important fortress on the Danube. Then with the bulk of his army he marched to the Rhine, crossed at Philipsburg on the 6th of September, and advanced towards Landau. Marshal Villeroi had constructed an entrenched camp to cover the town; but on the approach of the victor of Blenheim he fell back, leaving Landau to its fate. Marlborough followed him, and made every effort to bring the French to a battle; but Villeroi fell back behind the Lauter, and then behind the Motter, abandoning without a blow one of the strongest countries in Europe. On the 11th of September Ulm surrendered, with 250 pieces of cannon; and upon the following day, Landau was invested. The Prince of Baden with 20,000 men conducted the siege, and Marlborough and Eugene with 30,000 covered the operations. Marlborough, however, determined on ending the campaign, if possible, by driving the French beyond the Moselle, and leaving Prince Eugene with 18,000 men, marched with 12,000 men on the 14th of October. After a tremendous march through a wild and desolate country, he arrived with his exhausted troops at Treves on the 29th, one day before the arrival of 10,000 French, who were advancing to occupy it. The garrison of 600 men in the citadel evacuated it at his approach. He immediately collected and set to work 6000 peasants to restore the fortifications. Leaving a garrison, he marched against the strong place of Traesbach. Here he was joined by twelve Dutch battalions from the Meuse; and having invested the place, he left the Prince of Hesse to conduct the siege--which speedily ended in the surrender of the place--and marched back with all haste to rejoin Prince Eugene. Leaving Eugene to cover the siege of Landau, Marlborough now hurried away to Hanover and Berlin, to stimulate the governments of Hanover and Prussia to renewed exertion; and by his address and conciliatory manner succeeded in making arrangements for 8000 fresh Prussian troops to be sent to the imperial armies in Italy, as the Duke of Savoy had been reduced to the last extremity there by the French. The Electress of Bavaria, who had been regent of that country since her husband left to join the French, had now no resource but submission, and she accordingly agreed to disband her remaining troops, and to make peace. The Hungarian insurrection was suppressed by Austria, now able to devote all its attention to that point: and Landau surrendered towards the end of November, when its garrison was reduced from 7000 to 3500, who became prisoners of war. All these decisive results arose from the victory of Blenheim. Had the British Government during the winter acceded to Marlborough\u0027s request, and voted men and money, he would have been able to march to Paris in the next campaign, and could have brought the war to an end; but the mistaken parsimony then, as often since, crippled the British general, allowed the French to recover from their disaster, prolonged the war for years, and cost the country very many times the money and the men that Marlborough had asked for to bring the war to a decisive termination. But while the English and Dutch governments refused to vote more money or men, and the German governments, freed from their pressing danger, became supine and lukewarm, the French, upon the contrary, set to in an admirable manner to retrieve the disasters they had suffered, and employed the winter in well-conceived efforts to take the field with a new army, to the full as strong as that which they had lost; and the fruits of Blenheim were, with the exception of the acquisition of a few fortresses, entirely thrown away. At the battle of Blenheim, Rupert Holliday escaped untouched, but Hugh was struck with a fragment of shell, and severely wounded. He was sent down the Rhine by water to the great military hospital which had been established at Bonn; and Rupert, who was greatly grieved at being separated from his faithful follower, had the satisfaction of hearing ere long that he was doing well. Rupert had assigned him as orderly a strong, active young fellow, named Joe Sedley, who was delighted at his appointment, for the \"little cornet\" was, since his defeat of the German champion, the pride of the regiment. Joe was a Londoner, one of those fellows who can turn their hand to anything, always full of fun, getting sometimes into scrapes, but a general favourite with his comrades. The campaign over, Rupert, who was now a lieutenant, asked and obtained leave to go home for the winter; he had long since been reconciled with his mother; and it was two years and a half since he had left home. Hugh and Joe Sedley had also obtained leave, upon Rupert\u0027s application on their behalf. On his way down Rupert resolved to pay a visit for a few days to his kind friends at Dort. They had written begging him to come and see them; and a postscript which Maria had put in her last letter to him, to the effect that she had reason to believe that her old persecutor was in the neighbourhood, and that her father had taken renewed precautions for her safety, added to his desire to visit Dort. \"That fellow\u0027s obstinacy is really admirable in its way,\" Rupert said, on reading this news. \"He has made up his mind that there is a fortune to be obtained by carrying off Maria van Duyk, and he sticks to it with the same pertinacity which other men display in the pursuit of commerce or of lawful trade, or that a wild beast shows in his tireless pursuit of his prey.\" Had it not been for the postscript, Rupert would have deferred his visit to Dort until after his return from England, but the news caused him serious uneasiness. He knew but too well the unscrupulous nature of this desperate man, whom he had heard of since his last attempt upon his life as being a leader of one of the bands of freebooters who, formed of deserters and other desperate men, frequented the Black Forest, the Vosges mountains, the Ardennes, and other forests and hill districts. That he would dare lead his band down into the plains of Holland, Rupert had no fear; still he could have no difficulty in finding men of ruined fortunes even there to join in any wild attempt. Leaving the army when it went into winter quarters, Rupert travelled by land to Bonn, and there picked up Hugh, who was now completely restored to health, and then, taking boat, journeyed down the Rhine. Then he took horse again, and rode to Dort. Mynheer van Duyk and Maria were delighted to see him; and Hugh and Sedley were hospitably received by the servants, with whom Hugh had, on the occasion of his last visit, made himself a prime favourite. For the first day of their arrival Rupert had all the talking to do, and his adventures to relate from the time he set sail from Dort. He had of course written from time to time, but his letters, although fairly full, did not contain a tithe of the detail which his friends were anxious to learn. The next morning, after breakfast, he asked his host if he was unwell, for he looked worn and anxious. \"I am well in body, but disturbed in mind,\" he said. \"Six months ago I stood well with my fellow citizens, and few were more popular in Dort than myself. Now, save among the better class, men look askance at me. Subtle whispers have gone abroad that I am in correspondence with France; that I am a traitor to Holland; that I correspond with the Spanish at Antwerp. In vain have I tried to force an open accusation, in order that I might disperse it. The merchants, and others of my rank, scoff at these rumours, and have in full council denounced their authors as slanderers; but the lower class still hold to their belief. Men scowl as I walk along; the boys shout \u0027Traitor!\u0027 after me; and I have received threatening letters.\" \"But this is abominable,\" Rupert said, hotly. \"Is there no way of dealing with these slanderers?\" \"No,\" the merchant said; \"I see none, beyond living it down. Some enemy is at work, steadily and powerfully.\" \"Have you any enemy you suspect?\" \"None, save indeed that rascal countryman of yours. He is desperate, and, as you know, relentless. My house has always been guarded by six stout fellows since we returned from the Hague; and any open attempt to carry off my daughter would be useless. It is difficult to see what he proposes to himself by stirring up a party against me; but he might have some scheme which we cannot fathom. Our Dutchmen are slow but obstinate, and once they get an idea in their head it is difficult to discharge.\" \"You do not fear any public tumult, surely?\" Rupert said. \"I do not anticipate it, and yet I regard it as possible,\" Van Duyk said. \"The people in our town have been given to bursts of frenzy, in which some of our best men have been slain.\" \"Why don\u0027t you go down to the Hague again till this madness has passed by?\" \"I cannot do that. My enemies would take advantage of it, and might sack my house and warehouses.\" \"But there is the burgher guard; and all the respectable citizens are with you.\" \"That is true enough,\" the merchant said; \"but they are always slow to take action, and I might be killed, and my place burnt before they came on to the ground. I will send Maria with you down to the Hague to her aunt\u0027s. If this be the work of the man we wot of, it may be that he will then cease his efforts, and the bad feeling he has raised will die away; but in truth, I shall never feel that Maria is safe until I hear that his evil course has come to an end.\" \"If I come across him, I will bring it to an end, and that quickly,\" Rupert said, wrathfully. \"At any rate, I think that the burgomaster ought to take steps to protect the house.\" \"The council laugh at the idea of danger,\" Van Duyk said. \"To them the idea that I should be charged with dealing with the enemy is so supremely ridiculous that they make light of it, and are inclined to think that the state of things I describe is purely a matter of my own imagination. If I were attacked they would come as quickly as they could to my aid; but they may be all too late. \"There is one thing, Rupert. This enemy hates you, and desires your death as much as he wishes to carry off my daughter, and through her to become possessed of my money bags. If, then, this work is his doing, assuredly he will bring it to a head while you are here, so as to gratify both his hate and his greed at once.\" \"It is a pity that you cannot make some public statement, that unless your daughter marries a man of whom you approve you will give her no fortune whatever.\" \"I might do that,\" Van Duyk said; \"but he knows that if he forced her to marry him, I should still give her my money. In the second place, she has a large fortune of her own, that came to her through her mother. And lastly, I believe that it is not marriage he wishes now, for he must be sure that Maria would die rather than accept him, but to carry her off, and then place some enormous sum as a ransom on condition of her being restored safe and unharmed to me. He knows that I would give all that I possess to save her from his hands.\" \"The only way out of it that I see,\" Rupert said, \"is for me to find him, and put an end to him.\" \"You will oblige me, Rupert, if, during the time you remain here, you would wear this fine mail shirt under your waistcoat. You do not wear your cuirass here; and your enemy might get a dagger planted between your shoulders as you walk the streets. It is light, and very strong. It was worn by a Spanish general who fell, in the days of Alva, in an attack upon Dort. My great-grandfather shot him through the head, and kept his mail shirt as a trophy.\" \"It is a useful thing against such a foe as this,\" Rupert said, putting it on at once. \"I could not wear it in battle, for it would be an unfair advantage; but against an assassin all arms are fair.\" During the day Rupert went out with his host, and the scowling looks which were turned upon the latter convinced him that the merchant had not exaggerated the extent to which the feeling of the lower class had been excited against him. So convinced was he of the danger of the position, that, to the immense surprise of Hugh and Joe Sedley, he ordered them to lie down at night in their clothes, with their swords and pistols ready by them. With eight armed men in the house--for four of the porters engaged in the merchant\u0027s warehouse slept on truckle beds placed in the hall--Rupert thought that they ought to be able to repel any assault which might be made. It was on the fourth night after Rupert\u0027s coming to Dort, that he was aroused by a touch on his shoulder. He leapt to his feet, and his hand, as he did so, grasped his sword, which lay ready beside him. \"What is it?\" he exclaimed. \"There is mischief afloat,\" Van Duyk said. \"There is a sound as of a crowd in front of the house. I have heard the tramp of many footsteps.\" Rupert went to the window and looked out. The night was dark, and the oil lamps had all been extinguished; but it seemed to him that a confused mass filled the place in which the house stood. \"Let me get the men under arms,\" he said, \"and then we can open the window, and ask what they want.\" In two minutes he returned. \"Now, sir, let us ask them at once. They are probably waiting for a leader or order.\" The merchant went to the window, and threw it open. \"Who is there?\" he asked. \"And what means this gathering at the door of a peaceful citizen?\" As if his voice had been the signal for which they waited, a roar went up from the immense crowd. A thunder of axes at the door and shutters, and a great shout arose, \"Death to the traitor! Death to the Frenchmen!\" Shots were fired at the windows, and at the same moment the alarm bell at the top of the house pealed loudly out, one of the serving men having previously received order to sound the signal if needed. In answer to the alarm bell, the watchman on the tower, whose duty it was to call the citizens from their beds in case of fire, struck the great bell, and its deep sounds rang out over the town. Two minutes later the church bells joined in the clamour; and the bell on the town hall with quick, sharp strokes called the burgher guard to arms. Van Duyk, knowing now that all that could be done had been effected, ran to his daughter\u0027s room, bade her dress, and keep her door locked until she heard his voice, come what may. Then he ran downstairs to join the defenders below. \"The shutters are giving everywhere,\" Rupert cried. \"We must hold this broad staircase. How long will it be, think you, before the burgher guard are here?\" \"A quarter of an hour, maybe.\" \"We should beat them back for that time,\" Rupert said. \"Light as many lights as you can, and place them so as to throw the light in their faces, and keep us in the shade.\" In two or three minutes a smashing of timber and loud shouts of triumph proclaimed that the mob were effecting an entrance. \"For the present I will stand in front, with one of these good fellows with their axes on each side of me. The other two shall stand behind us, a step or two higher. You, Hugh and Joe, take post with our host in the gallery above with your pistols, and cover us by shooting any man who presses us hard. Fire slowly, pick off your men, and only leave your posts and join me here on the last necessity.\" They had just taken the posts assigned to them when the door fell in with a crash, and the mob poured in, just as a rush took place from the side passages by those who had made their way in through the lower windows. \"A grim set of men,\" Rupert said to himself. They were indeed a grim set. Many bore torches, which, when once need for quiet and concealment was over, they had lighted. Dort did a large export trade in hides and in meat to the towns lying below them, and it was clear that it was from the butchers and skinners that the mob was chiefly drawn. Huge figures, with poleaxes and long knives, in leathern clothes spotted and stained with blood, showed wild and fierce in the red light of the torches, as they brandished their weapons, and prepared to assault the little band who held the broad stairs. Rupert advanced a step below the rest, and shouted: \"What means this? I am an officer of the Duke of Marlborough\u0027s army, and I warn you against lifting a hand against my host and good friend Mynheer van Duyk.\" \"It\u0027s a lie!\" shouted one of the crowd. \"We know you; you are a Frenchman masquerading in English uniform. \"Down with him, my friends. Death to the traitors!\" There was a rush up the stairs, and in an instant the terrible fight began. On open ground, Rupert, with his activity and his straight sword, would have made short work of one of the brawny giants who now attacked him, for he could have leapt out of reach of the tremendous blow, and have run his opponent through ere he could again lift his ponderous axe. But there was no guarding such swinging blows as these with a light sword; and even the advantage of the height of the stairs was here of little use. At first he felt that the combat was desperate. Soon, however, he regained confidence in his sword. With it held ever straight in front of him, the men mounting could not strike without laying open their breasts to the blade. There must, he felt, be no guarding on his part; he must be ever on the offensive. All this was felt rather than thought in the whirl of action. One after another the leaders of the assailants fell, pierced through the throat while their ponderous axes were in the act of descending. By his side the Dutchman\u0027s retainers fought sturdily, while the crack of the pistols of Hugh, Joe Sedley, and the master of the house were generally followed by a cry and a fall from the assailants. As the difficulty of their task became more apparent, the yells of fury of the crowd increased. Many of them were half drunk, and their wild gestures and shouts, the waving of their torches, and the brandishing of knives and axes, made the scene a sort of pandemonium. Ten minutes had passed since the first attack, and still the stairs were held. One of the defenders lay dead, with his head cloven to his shoulders with a poleaxe, but another had taken his place. Suddenly, from behind, the figure of a man bounded down the stairs from the gallery, and with a cry of \"Die, villain!\" struck Rupert with a dagger with all his strength, and then bounded back into the gallery. Rupert fell headlong amid his assailants below. Hugh and Joe Sedley, with a shout of rage and horror, dashed from their places, sword in hand, and leaping headlong down the stairs, cutting and hewing with their heavy swords, swept all opposition back, and stood at the foot, over the body of Rupert. The three Dutchmen and Van Duyk followed their example, and formed a group round the foot of the stairs. Then there was a wild storm of falling blows, the clash of sword and axe, furious shouts, loud death cries, a very turmoil of strife; when there was a cry at the door of \"The watch!\" and then a loud command: \"Cut the knaves down! Slay every man! Dort! Dort!\" There was a rush now to escape. Down the passages fled the late assailants, pursued by the burgher guard, who, jealous of the honour of their town, injured by this foul attack upon a leading citizen, cut down all they came upon; while many who made their escape through the windows by which they had entered, were cut down or captured by the guard outside. The defenders of the stairs made no attempt at pursuit. The instant the burgher guard entered the hall, Hugh and Joe threw down their bloodstained swords, and knelt beside Rupert. \"Ough!\" sighed the latter, in a long breath. \"Thank God! He is not dead.\" \"Dead!\" Rupert gasped, \"not a bit of it; only almost trodden to death. One of my stout friends has been standing on me all the time, though I roared for mercy so that you might have heard me a mile off, had it not been for the din.\" \"But are you not stabbed, Master Rupert?\" \"Stabbed! No; who should have stabbed me? One of you somehow hit me on the back, and down I went; but there is no stab.\" \"He had a dagger. I saw it flash,\" Hugh said, lifting Rupert to his feet. \"Had he?\" Rupert said; \"and who was he? \"If it was an enemy, it is your coat of mail has saved me,\" he continued, turning to Van Duyk. \"I have never taken it off since. But how did he get behind me I wonder? \"Run,\" he continued energetically, \"and see if the lady is safe. There must have been mischief behind.\" Mynheer van Duyk, closely followed by the others, ran upstairs to his daughter\u0027s room. The door was open. He rushed into the room. It was empty. The window was open; and looking out, two ladders were seen, side by side. It was clear that while the fray had been raging, Maria von Duyk had been carried off. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3111/85663.html","bookId":933,"book":{"id":933,"title":"The Cornet of Horse","description":"简介： One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four--turn to your lady; one, two, three, four--now deep reverence.
