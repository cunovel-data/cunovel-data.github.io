{"id":19840,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5: The Fencing School.","content":"It was with no small trepidation that Rupert Holliday ascended the steps of the Earl of Marlborough\u0027s residence in Pall Mall. Hugh accompanied him thus far and stopped at the door, outside which, in the courtyard and in the hall, were standing many lackeys who had attended their masters. Rupert felt very young, and the somewhat surprised looks of the servants in the hall at his appearance added to his feeling of youth. He was shown into an antechamber, where a number of officers of all ranks, of courtiers, and politicians, were assembled, talking in groups. Rupert felt alone and uncomfortable among this crowd of distinguished men, none of whom did he know, and no one paid the smallest attention to him. He had on entering written his name down in a book in the hall, whence it would be taken in with others to the great man. Presently an officer in general\u0027s uniform came out from an inner room, and an instant afterwards the earl himself appeared. Not only was John Churchill one of the most handsome men in Europe, but he was the most courtly and winning in manner; and Rupert, shrinking back from observation, watched with admiration as he moved round the room, stopping to say a few words here, shaking hands there, listening to a short urgent person, giving an answer to a petition, before presented, by another, giving pleasure and satisfaction wherever he moved. Rupert saw, however, that even while speaking his eye was wandering round the room, and directly he perceived him he walked straight towards him, those standing between falling back as he advanced. \"Ah, my young friend,\" he said warmly, holding out his hand to Rupert, \"I was expecting you. \"Sir John Loveday, Lord Fairholm,\" he said, turning to two young gentlemen near, \"let me present to you Master Rupert Holliday, grandson of Colonel Holliday, one of the bravest of our cavaliers, and who I can guarantee has inherited the skill and courage of his grandfather. He will make the campaign in Holland with you, gentlemen, for his commission has been made out today in her Majesty\u0027s fifth regiment of dragoons. \"I will speak to you more, presently, Rupert.\" So saying, the earl moved away among his visitors, leaving Rupert flushed with pleasure and confusion. The young gentlemen to whom the earl had introduced him, much surprised at the flattering manner in which the great general had spoken of the lad before them, at once entered into conversation with him, and hearing that he was but newly come to London, offered to show him the various places where men of fashion resorted, and begged him to consider them at his disposal. Rupert, who had been carefully instructed by his grandfather in courtly expression and manner, returned many thanks to the gentlemen for their obliging offers, of which, after he had again spoken to the earl, and knew what commands he would lay upon him, he would thankfully avail himself. It was nearly an hour before the Earl of Marlborough had made the round of the antechamber, but the time passed quickly to Rupert. The room was full of men whose names were prominent in the history of the time, and these Sir John Loveday, and Lord Fairholm, who were lively young men, twenty-two or twenty-three years old, pointed out to him, often telling him a merry story or some droll jest regarding them. There was Saint John, handsome, but delicate looking, with a half sneer on his face, and dressed in the extremity of fashion, with a coat of peach-coloured velvet with immense cuffs, crimson leather shoes with diamond buckles; his sword was also diamond hilted, his hands were almost hidden in lace ruffles, and he wore his hair in ringlets of some twenty inches in length, tied behind with a red ribbon. The tall man, with a haughty but irritable face, in the scarlet uniform of a general officer, was the Earl of Peterborough. There too were Godolphin and Orford, both leading members of the cabinet; the Earl of Sutherland, the Dukes of Devonshire and Newcastle, Lord Nottingham, and many others. At last the audience was over, and the minister, bowing to all, withdrew, and the visitors began to leave. A lackey came up to Rupert and requested him to follow him; and bidding adieu to his new friends, who both gave him their addresses and begged him to call up on them, he followed the servant into the hall and upstairs into a cosy room, such as would now be called a boudoir. There stood the Earl of Marlborough, by the chair in which a lady of great beauty and commanding air was sitting. \"Sarah,\" he said, \"this is my young friend, Rupert Holliday, who as you know did me good service in the midlands.\" The countess held out her hand kindly to Rupert, and he bent over it and touched it with his lips. \"You must remember you are my friend as well as my husband\u0027s,\" she said. \"He tells me you saved his life; and although I can scarce credit the tale, seeing how young you are, yet courage and skill dwell not necessarily in great bodies. Truly, Master Holliday, I am deeply indebted to you; and Sarah Churchill is true in her friendships.\" \"As in her hates, eh?\" laughed the earl. Between the Earl of Marlborough and his wife there existed no common affection. They were passionately attached to each other; and the earl\u0027s letters show that at all times, even when in the field surrounded by difficulties, harassed by opposition, menaced with destruction by superior forces, his thoughts were turned affectionately towards her, and he was ever wishing that the war would end that he might return to her side. She on her part was equally attached to him, but much as she strove to add to his power and to forward his plans, her haughty and violent temper was the main cause of the unmerited disgrace into which he fell with his royal mistress, who owed so much to him personally, and whose reign he did so much to render a brilliant and successful one. At the present time, however, she stood upon the footing of the closest intimacy and affection with Queen Anne. The earl then introduced Rupert to those other ladies who were present; the eldest, his daughter Lady Harriet, recently married to Mr. Godolphin; the second, Anne, married to Lord Spencer; and the two daughters still unmarried, aged sixteen and seventeen respectively. Rupert was so confused with the earl\u0027s kindness that he had difficulty in finding words, but he made a great effort, and expressed in proper set terms his thankfulness to the countess for her great kindness to him, and of his own want of deserts. \"There,\" the countess said, \"that will do very nicely and prettily; and now put it aside until we are in public, and talk in your own natural way. So you have been fighting again, have you, and well-nigh killing young Master Brownlow?\" Rupert was completely astounded at this address; and the earl said, laughing: \"I told you that I expected you. The worthy colonel your grandfather wrote me a letter, which I received this morning, telling me the incident which had taken place, and your sudden disappearance, stating that he doubted not you had made for London, and begging--which indeed was in no way necessary--my protection on your behalf.\" \"Did my grandfather say, sir,\" Rupert asked anxiously, \"aught of the state of Master Brownlow?\" \"Yes; he said that the leech had strong hopes that he would recover.\" \"I am indeed glad of that,\" Rupert said; \"for I had no ill will to him.\" \"We must be careful of you, Master Holliday,\" the countess said; \"for if you go on like this you will much diminish the number of the queen\u0027s subjects.\" \"I can assure your grace,\" Rupert said earnestly, \"that I am no brawler, and am not quarrelsome by nature, and that the thought of shedding blood, except of the foes of my country in battle, pains me much.\" \"I\u0027ll warrant me you are the mildest-tempered boy alive,\" the earl said. \"Now tell me frankly: you have been in London some forty-eight hours; have you passed that time without getting into a fray or quarrel of any kind?\" Rupert turned scarlet with confusion. \"His looks betray him,\" the earl laughed. \"Look, girls, at the mild-tempered young gentleman. \"Now, out with it. How was it?\" Thus exhorted, Rupert very stammeringly gave an account of the fray in which he had been engaged. \"Von Duyk!\" the earl said. \"She must be a daughter of the great merchant of Dort--a useful friend to have made, maybe, Master Holliday; and it may be that your adventure may even be of service to the state. Never speak now, Master Rupert, of your peaceful intentions. You take after your namesake, the Prince, and are a veritable knight errant of adventure. The sooner I have you over in Holland fighting the queen\u0027s enemies, and not the queen\u0027s subjects, the better. \"Now tell me, where have you taken up your abode?\" \"At the Bell, at Bishopsgate Street,\" Rupert answered. \"And your follower, for I know one accompanied you; where is he?\" \"He waits without, sir.\" The earl touched a hand bell. \"Fetch in Master Holliday\u0027s retainer; you will find him without. Make him at home in the servant\u0027s hall. Send a messenger down to the Bell at Bishopsgate, fetch hither the mails of Master Holliday; he will remain as my guest at present.\" Rupert now entered upon a life very different to that which he had led hitherto. He received a letter from Colonel Holliday, enclosing an order on a London banker for fifty pounds, and he was soon provided with suits of clothes fit for balls and other occasions. Wherever the earl went, Rupert accompanied him as one of his personal followers; and the frank, straightforward manners of the lad pleased the ladies of the court, and thus \"Little Holliday,\" as he was called, soon became a great favourite. It was about a fortnight after his arrival in town that, for the first time, he accompanied his friends Sir John Loveday and Lord Fairholm to the fencing school of Maitre Dalboy, the great fencing master of the day. Rupert had been looking forward much to this visit, as he was anxious to see what was the degree of proficiency of the young court gallants in the art which he so much loved. Maitre Dalboy\u0027s school was a fashionable lounge of the young men of the court and army. It was a large and lofty room, and some six assistants were in the act of giving instructions to beginners, or of fencing with more advanced students, when the trio entered. Maitre Dalboy himself came up to greet them, for both Rupert\u0027s friends had been his pupils. \"You are strangers,\" he said reproachfully. \"How are your muscles to keep in good order, and your eye true, if you do not practise? It is heart rending! I take every pains to turn out accomplished swordsmen; and no sooner have my pupils learned something of the business, than they begin to forget it.\" \"We shall begin to put your teaching into effect before long, Maitre Dalboy,\" Sir John Loveday said, with a smile, \"for we are going over to join the army in Holland in a few weeks, and we shall then have an opportunity of trying the utility of the parries you have taught us.\" \"It is too bad,\" the Frenchman said, shrugging his shoulders, \"that my pupils should use the science I have taught them against my countrymen; but what would you have? It is the fortune of war. Is this young gentleman a new pupil that you have brought me?\" \"No, indeed,\" Lord Fairholm said; \"this is Master Rupert Holliday, a cornet in the 5th regiment of dragoons, who is also about to start for Holland.\" \"I have had the advantage of learning from a countryman of yours, Monsieur Dalboy,\" Rupert said, \"a Monsieur Dessin, who is good enough to teach the noble art in the town of Derby.\" \"Dessin! Dessin!\" Maitre Dalboy said, thoughtfully \"I do not remember the name among our maitres d\u0027escrime.\" \"The Earl of Marlborough himself vouches for the skill of Master Holliday with the sword. His grandfather, Colonel Holliday, was, I believe, noted as one of the finest blades at the court of Saint Germains.\" \"I have heard of him,\" Monsieur Dalboy said, with interest. \"Let me think; he wounded the Marquis de Beauchamp, who was considered one of the best swordsmen in France. Yes, yes, his fame as a swordsman is still remembered. And he is alive yet?\" \"Alive and active,\" Rupert said; \"and although, as he says himself, he has lost some of his quickness of reposte, there are, Monsieur Dessin says, few fencers who could even now treat him lightly.\" \"And you have had the benefit of his instruction as well as that of my countryman?\" Monsieur Dalboy asked. \"Yes,\" Rupert said, \"my grandfather, although he cares not at his age for prolonged exercise, has yet made a point of giving me for a few minutes each day the benefit of his skill.\" \"I should like to have a bout with you, Master Holliday,\" Monsieur Dalboy said; \"will you take a foil? I am curious to see what the united teaching of my countryman and that noted swordsman Colonel Holliday may have done. To me, as a master, it is interesting to discover what is possible with good teachers, when the science is begun young. What may your age be, Master Holliday?\" \"I am four months short of sixteen,\" Rupert said, \"and I shall be very proud of the honour of crossing swords with so famed a master as yourself, if you think me worthy of so great a privilege.\" There was quite a sensation in the fencing school, round which were gathered some forty or fifty of the young men of the day, when Maitre Dalboy called for his plastron and foil, for it was seldom indeed, and then only with swordsmen of altogether exceptional strength, that Monsieur Dalboy condescended to fence, contenting himself ordinarily with walking about the school and giving a hint now and then to those fencing with his assistants, not, perhaps, more than once a week taking a foil in his hand to illustrate some thrust or guard which he was inculcating. At this call, therefore, there was a general silence; and everyone turned to see who was the fencer whom the great master thus signally deigned to honour. Great was the astonishment when, as Monsieur Dalboy divested himself of his coat and vest, the lad who had entered with Lord Fairholm and Sir John Loveday was seen similarly to prepare for the contest. \"Who is he? What singular freak is this of the maitre to take up a foil with a boy!\" was the question which ran round the room. Several of those present had met Rupert Holliday, and could give his name; but none could account for the freak on the part of the master. Fortunately Rupert was unacquainted with the fact that what seemed to him a natural occurrence was an extraordinary event in the eyes of all assembled, and he therefore experienced no feeling of nervousness whatever. He knew that Colonel Holliday was a master of the sword, and his grandfather had told him that Monsieur Dessin was an altogether exceptional swordsman. As he knew himself to be fully a match for the latter, he felt sure that, however perfect a master Monsieur Dalboy might be, he need not fear discrediting his master, even if his present opponent should prove more than his match. There was a dead silence of curiosity at the singularity of the affair, as Rupert Holliday took his post face to face with the master; but a murmur of surprise and admiration ran round the room at the grace and perfection of accuracy with which Rupert went through the various parades which were then customary before the combatants crossed swords. Rupert felt as calm and as steady as when fencing at home, and determined to use all his caution as well as all his skill; for not only did he feel that his own strength was upon trial, but that the honour of the teachers who had taken such pains with him was concerned in the result. The swords had scarcely crossed when an expression of surprise passed across Maitre Dalboy\u0027s face. The first few passes showed him that in this lad he had found an opponent of no ordinary character, and that all his skill would be needed to obtain a victory over him. For the first few minutes each fought cautiously, feeling each other\u0027s strength rather than attempting to attack seriously. Then the master dropped his point. \"Ma foi! Young sir, you have done monsieur le colonel and my compatriot justice. I offer you my congratulations.\" \"They are premature, sir,\" Rupert said, smiling; \"you have not as yet begun.\" The silence in the school was even more profound when the swords again crossed than it had been when the bout began, for wonder had now taken the place of amused curiosity. The struggle now commenced in earnest. Several times at first Rupert narrowly escaped being touched, for the master\u0027s play was new to him. The thrusts and feints, the various attacks, were all familiar; but whereas Colonel Holliday had fought simply with his arm and his head, standing immovably in one place, and Monsieur Dessin had, although quick to advance and fall back, fought comparatively on the defensive, while he himself had been the assailant from his superior activity, Monsieur Dalboy was as quick and as active as himself, and the rapidity of the attacks, the quick bounds, the swift rushes, at first almost bewildered him; but gradually, as he grew accustomed to the play, he steadied himself, and eluded the master\u0027s attacks with an activity as great as his own. In vain Monsieur Dalboy employed every feint, every combination in his repertoire. Rupert was always prepared, for from one or other of his teachers he had learnt the defence to be employed against each; and at last, as the master, exhausted with his exertions, flagged a little, Rupert in turn took the offensive. Now Monsieur Dalboy\u0027s skill stood him in equal stead to defend himself against Rupert\u0027s rapid attacks and lightning-like passes and thrusts; and although the combat had lasted without a second\u0027s interruption for nearly a quarter of an hour, neither combatant had touched the other. At last Rupert saw by his opponent\u0027s eye that a new and special combination was about to be put into action against him, and he instantly steadied himself to resist it. It came with the rapidity of thought, but Rupert recognized it by the first pass as the very last combination which Monsieur Dessin had taught him, assuring him at the time that he would find it irresistible, for that there were not three men in Europe acquainted with it. He met the attack then with the defence which Monsieur Dessin had showed him to be the sure escape, ending with a wrench which nearly tore the sword from the hand of his opponent. Monsieur Dalboy sprang back on guard, with a look of profound astonishment; and then throwing down his foil, he threw himself, in the impetuous manner of his countrymen, on Rupert\u0027s neck, and embraced him. \"Mon dieu! mon dieu!\" he exclaimed, \"You are incroyable, you are a miracle. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, turning to those present, when the burst of enthusiastic applause which greeted the conclusion of this extraordinary contest subsided, \"you see in this young gentleman one of the finest swordsmen in Europe. I do not say the finest, for he has not touched me, and having no idea of his force I extended myself rashly at first; but I may say he is my equal. Never but once have I crossed swords with such a fencer, and I doubt if even he was as strong. His parry to my last attack was miraculous. It was a coup invented by myself, and brought to perfection with that one I speak of. I believed no one else knew it, and have ever reserved it for a last extremity; but his defence, even to the last wrench, which would have disarmed any other man but myself, and even me had I not known that it should have come then, was perfect; it was astounding. \"This maitre of yours--this Monsieur Dessin,\" he went on, turning to Rupert, \"must be a wonder. \"Ah!\" he said suddenly, and as if to himself; \"c\u0027est bien possible! What was he like, this Monsieur Dessin?\" \"He is tall, and slight except as to his shoulders, where he is very broad.\" \"And he has a little scar here, has he not?\" the fencing master said, pointing to his temple. \"Yes,\" Rupert said, surprised; \"I have often noticed it.\" \"Then it is he,\" Monsieur Dalboy said, \"the swordsman of whom I spoke. No wonder you parried my coup. I had wondered what had become of him. And you know him as Monsieur Dessin? And he teaches fencing?\" \"Yes,\" Rupert said; \"but my grandfather always said that Monsieur Dessin was only an assumed name, and that he was undoubtedly of noble blood.\" \"Your grandfather was right,\" the master said. \"Yes, you have had wonderful masters; but unless I had seen it, I should not have believed that even the best masters in the world could have turned out such a swordsman as you at your age.\" By this time the various couples had begun fencing again, and the room resounded with the talk of the numerous lookers on, who were all discoursing on what appeared to them, as to Monsieur Dalboy, the almost miraculous occurrence of a lad under sixteen holding his own against a man who had the reputation of being the finest maitre in Europe. Lord Fairholm, Sir John Loveday, and other gentlemen, now came round. \"I was rather thinking,\" Sir John said, with a laugh, \"of taking you under my protection, Master Holliday, and fighting your battles for you, as an old boy does for a young one at school; but it must even be the other way. And by my faith, if any German Ritter or French swordsman should challenge the British dragoons to a trial of the sword, we shall put you forth as our David.\" \"I trust that that may not be,\" Rupert said; \"for though in battle I hope that I shall not be found wanting, yet I trust that I shall have nought to do in private quarrels, but be looked upon as one of a peaceful disposition.\" \"Very peaceful, doubtless!\" laughed Lord Fairholm. \"Tell me, Master Rupert, honestly now, didst ever use in earnest that sword that you have just shown that you know so well how to wield?\" Rupert flushed up crimson. \"Yes,\" he said, with a shame-faced look, \"I have twice used my sword in self defence.\" \"Ha, ha! Our peaceful friend!\" laughed Lord Fairholm. \"And tell me, didst put an end to both unfortunates?\" Rupert coloured still more deeply. \"I had the misfortune to slay one, my lord; but there are good hopes that the other will recover.\" A general shout of laughter greeted the announcement, which together with Rupert\u0027s evident shame-faced look, was altogether too much for their gravity. Just at this moment a diversion was caused by a young man dressed in the extreme of fashion who entered the school. He had a dissipated and jaded air. \"Fulke, where hast been?\" one of the group standing round Rupert asked. \"We have missed you these two weeks. Someone said you had been roughly mauled, and had even lost some teeth. Is it so?\" \"It is,\" the newcomer said, with an angry scowl. \"Any beauty I once may have had is gone forever. I have lost three of my upper teeth, and two of my lower, and I am learning now to speak with my lips shut, so as to hide the gap.\" \"But how came it about?\" \"I was walking down a side street off the Strand, when four men sprang out and held my hands to my side, another snatched my watch and purse, and as I gave a cry for the watch, he smote me with the pommel of his rapier in my mouth, then throwing me on the ground the villains took to their heels together.\" The exclamations of commiseration and indignation which arose around, were abruptly checked by a loud laugh from Rupert. There was a dead silence and Sir Richard Fulke, turning his eyes with fury towards the lad who had dared to jeer at his misfortune, demanded why he laughed. \"I could not help but laugh,\" Rupert said, \"although doubtless it was unmannerly; but your worship\u0027s story reminded me so marvellously of the tale of the stout knight, Sir John Falstaff\u0027s adventure with the men of buckram.\" \"What mean you?\" thundered Sir Richard. \"I mean, sir,\" Rupert said quietly, \"that your story has not one word of truth in it. I came upon you in that side street off the Strand, as you were trying to carry off by force, aided by a rascal named Captain Copper, a lady, whose name shall not be mentioned here. I had not my sword with me, but with a walking stick I trounced your friend the captain, and then, with my stick against your rapier, I knocked out those teeth you regret, with a fair thrust. \"If my word is doubted, gentlemen, Alderman Hawkins, who heard the details of the matter from the young lady and her chairman, can vouch for it.\" A cry of fury burst from Sir Richard Fulke; and drawing his sword he would have sprung upon the lad, who had not only disfigured him for life, but now made him the laughingstock of society, for the tale would, he knew, spread far and wide. Several of the gentlemen threw themselves between him and Rupert. \"I will have his life\u0027s blood!\" he exclaimed, struggling in the arms of those who would hold him back. \"I will kill the dog as he stands.\" \"Sir Richard Fulke,\" Lord Fairholm said, \"Master Holliday is a friend of mine, and will give you an honourable meeting when you will; but I should advise you to smother your choler. It seems he proved himself with a stick your superior, although armed with a sword, and Master Dalboy will tell you that it is better to leave him alone.\" Master Dalboy was standing by, and going up to Sir Richard, he said: \"Sir, if you will take my poor advice you will go your way, and leave Master Holliday to himself. He has, as those here will tell you, proved himself fully my equal as a swordsman, and could kill you if only armed with a six-inch dagger against your sword. It would be safer for you to challenge the whole of those in this present company than to cross swords with him.\" A few words from those standing round corroborated a statement which at first appeared fabulous; and then finding that an open encounter with Rupert would be the worst possible method of obtaining satisfaction for the injuries he had received, Sir Richard Fulke flung himself out of the school, muttering deep vows of future vengeance. \"You have made a dangerous enemy,\" Lord Fairholm said, as the three friends walked homeward. \"He bears a bad character, and is a reckless and ruined man. After what he has heard of your skill as a swordsman he will, we may be sure, take no open steps against you; but it is certain that he will scheme night and day for vengeance. When the report gets abroad of his cock-and-bull story, and the true history of the loss of his teeth, he will not be able to show his face in public for some time; but he will be none the less dangerous. Through that notorious ruffian, Captain Copper, he can dispose of half the cutthroats about the town, and I should advise you not to go out after dark until you have put the seas between you and him, and even then you had better be cautious for a time.\" Rupert agreed with his friend\u0027s advice, and the next day begged his patron to let him embark at once for Holland, in a ship that was to sail with troops from London Bridge. He urged as his reason for desiring to go at once, his wish to learn something at least of his duties before the campaign began. As the earl had already heard a rumour of the scene in the fencing school, he made no opposition to the plan, and the next day Rupert, accompanied by Hugh, sailed down the Thames, bound for Rotterdam.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3111/85654.html","bookId":933,"book":{"id":933,"title":"The Cornet of Horse","description":"简介： One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four--turn to your lady; one, two, three, four--now deep reverence.
