{"id":19839,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4: The Sedan Chair.","content":"\"This is our last stage, Hugh, and tonight we shall be in London,\" Rupert said, as they rode out of Watford. \"Methinks we shall find it very strange in that great city. I am glad I thought of asking our host the name of an inn at which to put up. The Bell in Bishopsgate Street, he said. It will seem less strange asking the way there than it would be to be wandering about gazing for a place at which to alight.\" \"Ay, truly, Master Rupert; and I\u0027ve heard say those London folk are main fond of making game of strangers.\" \"So I have heard, Hugh; any reasonable jest we had best put up with with good temper. If they push it too far, we shall be able, I doubt not, to hold our own. The first thing to do will be to get clothes of the cut in vogue, for I have come away just as I stood; and I fear that even your clothes will have a marvellously country air about them in the eyes of the city folk. \"There is London,\" he said, as they passed over the crest of Hampstead Hill. \"That great round dome that stands up so high must be Saint Paul\u0027s; and look how many other church towers and spires there are. And there, away to the right, those must be the towers of Westminster.\" \"It is a big place, surely, Master Rupert. How many people do you think live there?\" \"I believe there are near 300,000 souls there, Hugh. It seems wonderful, does it not?\" \"It\u0027s too big to think of, Master Rupert,\" Hugh said, and they continued their journey southward. They entered the city at Aldersgate, but they had ridden some distance through houses before they arrived at the boundary, for the city was already spreading beyond its ancient limits. Once inside the walls, the lads were astonished at the bustle and noise. Hugh inquired the way to Bishopsgate Street of a respectable citizen, who directed them to follow the road until they came to a broad turning to their left. This would be Chepeside, and they were to follow this until they came to the Exchange, a large building straight in front of them. Passing this, they would find themselves in Bishopsgate Street. If Aldersgate Street had surprised them, much more were they astonished at the din and turmoil of Chepeside, and Hugh, having twice narrowly escaped riding over a citizen, and being soundly rated for a country gawk, Rupert turned to him. \"Look at your horse\u0027s head, Hugh, and pay no attention to aught else. When we have reached our destination, we shall have plenty of time to look at all these wonders.\" The advice was good, and without mischance they reached the Bell in Bishopsgate Street, and rode into the yard. The host at once came out, and after a momentary look of surprise at the youth of the new arrivals, he asked Rupert courteously if he needed a room. \"Two rooms if it please you,\" Rupert said, \"and together.\" The host called a hostler, who at once took charge of the horses, and led them to the stable, the lads first removing the valises and holsters, which a servant carried up to their rooms. \"We would have supper,\" Rupert said; \"and while that is preparing we would, if it is not too late, order some clothes more in the mode than these. Can you direct us to a tailor?\" \"You cannot do better,\" the landlord said, \"than visit my neighbour, Master John Haliford. His shop is just opposite, and he makes for many of our best city folk, and for more than one of the gentry of the Court.\" Rupert thanked him, and they crossed the street to the shop indicated. The landlord looked after them with a puzzled air. \"It is not often that Joe Miles cannot guess the quality and errand of his guests, but this time he is floored. Has that young spark run away from home? I hardly think so, for he speaks gravely, and without haste; lads who have run away may generally be known by their speaking in a hurry, and as if anxious. They are both well mounted; the younger is clearly of the higher estate, although but meanly dressed; nor does the other seem like his lackey. What are they talking about outside neighbour Haliford\u0027s shop, I wonder? I would give a silver penny to know. I will walk over presently, and smoke a pipe with him, and hear what he thinks of them.\" The conversation which the host of the Bell had wished he could overhear was as follows: Hugh began it. \"Look, Master Rupert, before we go into the shop, let us talk over what you are going to order.\" \"I am going to order a walking suit, Hugh, and a court suit for myself, and a suit for you.\" \"Yes, but what sort of a suit, Master Rupert?\" \"I should say a walking suit, Hugh, such as would become a modest citizen.\" \"That\u0027s just it, Master Rupert. So far you have treated me as a friend; but now, sir, it must be different, for to do so any longer would not be seemly. You are going to be an officer. I am going to follow you as a trooper; but till we go to the war I must be dressed as your retainer. Not a lackey, perhaps, but a sort of confidential retainer. That will be best, Master Rupert, in every way.\" Rupert was silent for a moment. \"Well, Hugh, perhaps that would be best; but you must remember that whatever we are before others, we are always friends when we are alone.\" \"Very well,\" Hugh said, \"that is understood; but you know that alone or before others, I shall always be your faithful servant.\" \"What can I make you, sir?\" the tailor asked, as the lads entered his shop. Master Haliford was a small man; neat in his dress; a little fussy in manner. He was very upright, and seemed to look under rather than through the pair of horn spectacles which he wore. His look changed from affability to doubt as he took a nearer look at his intending customers. \"I need a suit such as a gentleman might wear at court,\" Rupert said, quietly, \"and a walking or ordinary suit for myself; and a suit such as would be worn by a trusted retainer for my friend here.\" The tailor put his head on one side, and rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \"Have I had the honour of being recommended to you by the honourable gentleman your father?\" he asked. \"No, indeed,\" Rupert said. \"It was mine host at the Bell, who advised me that I could not do better than come to your shop.\" \"Ah, you are known to him, beyond doubt,\" John Haliford said, brightening. \"No, indeed,\" Rupert answered. \"He was a stranger to me to within five minutes back.\" \"You must excuse my caution, young sir,\" John Haliford said, after another minute\u0027s reflection; \"but it is the custom of us London tradesmen with those gentlemen who may honour us with their custom, and whom we have not the honour of knowing, to require payment, or at least a portion of payment, at the time of giving the order, and the rest at the time of delivery of the goods. In your case, sir, I am sure, an unnecessary piece of caution, but a rule from which I never venture to go.\" \"That is only fair and right,\" Rupert said. \"I will pay half now, and the other half when the garments are completed; or if it please you, will pay the whole in advance.\" \"By no means, by no means,\" the tailor said with alacrity; \"one third in advance is my rule, sir. And now, sir, what colour and material do you affect?\" \"As sober both in hue and in material as may be,\" Rupert said, \"and yet sufficiently in the fashion for me to wear in calling upon a nobleman of the court.\" \"Pardon me,\" the tailor said, \"but perhaps you would condescend to take me into your confidence. There are noblemen, and noblemen. A tory lord, for instance, is generally a little richer in his colour than a whig nobleman, for these affect a certain sobriety of air. With some again, a certain military cut is permitted, while with others this would be altogether out of place.\" \"I am going to the Earl of Marlborough,\" Rupert said briefly. \"Dear me, dear me! Indeed now!\" the little tailor said with an instant and great accession of deference, for the Earl of Marlborough was the greatest man in the realm. \"Had your honour mentioned that at first, I should not have ventured to hint at the need for previous payment.\" \"What!\" Rupert said, with a smile. \"You would have broken your fixed rule! Surely not, Master Haliford.\" The tailor looked sharply at his young customer. Whoever he might be, he was clearly no fool; and without more ado he brought forward his patterns and bent himself to the work in hand. Having chosen the colours and stuffs for the suits of clothes, the lads returned to the Bell, where a supper of cold chicken and the remains of a fine sirloin awaited them, with two tankards of home-brewed ale. The next morning, before sallying out to see the town, Rupert wrote to his grandfather, asking his pardon for running away, expressing his intention of applying to the Earl of Marlborough for a cornetcy of horse, and giving his address at the Bell; asking him also to make his humble excuse to his lady mother, and to assure her of his devotion and respect, although circumstances had caused his apparent disobedience to her wishes. Although there was a much greater amount of filial respect and obedience expressed in those days than now, human nature has differed but slightly in different ages of the world; and it is probable that sons went their own way quite as much as they do now, when there is very little talk either of obedience or respect. Indeed, the implicit obedience, and almost servile respect, which our forefathers expected from their sons, could not but in a great number of cases drive the sons to be hypocrites as well as undutiful; and our modern system of making our boys companions and friends, of taking an interest in all they do, and in teaching them to regard us as their natural advisers, has produced a generation of boys less outwardly respectful, no doubt, but as dutiful, and far more frank and truthful than those of the bygone times. Rupert, finding that few of the citizens wore swords, and feeling that in his present attire he would attract attention by so doing, left his sword at the inn, and bought for Hugh and himself a couple of stout sticks--Hugh\u0027s a cudgel which would be useful in a hand well accustomed to singlestick, his own a cane of a wood such as he had never before seen--light, strong, and stiff. He chose it because it was well balanced in the hand. Then they sallied out into Cornhill, past the Exchange, erected by the worshipful citizen Sir Thomas Gresham, and then into Chepeside, where they were astonished at the wealth and variety of the wares displayed in the shops. Gazing into the windows, they frequently got into the way, and were saluted many times with the query, \"Where are you going, stupids?\" a question which Hugh was largely inclined to resent, and would have done so had not Rupert told him that evidently they did get into the way of the hurrying citizens, and that it was more wise to put up with rudeness than to embark in a series of quarrels, in which, moreover, as strangers they were likely to get the worst of the dispute. Saint Paul\u0027s Cathedral, then but newly finished, astonished them vastly with its size and magnificence, and they returned to the midday dinner at the Bell delighted with all that they had seen. Asking the landlord how he would recommend them to pass the afternoon, he said that they could do no better than take a boat at London Bridge, and be rowed up to the village of Chelsea, where many of the nobility did dwell, and then coming back to Westminster might get out there, see the Abbey and the great Hall, and then walk back along the Strand. The lads followed the advice, and were soon delighted and surprised with the great river, then pure and limpid, and covered with boats proceeding rapidly in all directions, for it was at that time the great highway of London. Tide was flowing and the river nearly full, and having given their waterman the intimation that time did not press, he rowed them very gently along in the centre of the stream, pointing out to them, when they had passed above the limits of the city, the various noblemen\u0027s houses scattered along the banks of the river. Off Westminster the waterman ceased rowing, to allow them to view the grand old Abbey; and then as they went on again, they marvelled at the contrast of the low, deserted marshes of Lambeth and Bankside, which contrasted so strongly with the magnificence and the life they had left behind. At Chelsea they admired the grand palace for the reception of old soldiers, and then--for the tide was turning now--floated back to Westminster. So long were they in going round the Abbey, and examining the tombs of the kings, that it was getting dark when they started eastward again, up past the Palace of Whitehall, and then along the Strand. Already the distance between the city and Westminster was connected with houses, and the junction of the two cities had fairly taken place. Dim oil lamps were lighted here and there as they went along, foot passengers bore lanterns to enable them to pick their way across rough places, and link men carried torches in front of sedan chairs, in which ladies were being taken to fashionable entertainments, which then commenced at six o\u0027clock. All this was new and amusing to the boys; and having gone into a tavern near the Abbey, and partaken of some refreshment, they were not pressed for time; and it was near eight before they seriously thought of proceeding towards the city. When a few hundred yards from Temple Bar, they heard a shouting and a scream down one of the streets leading to the river. The street was deserted, but down at the farther end they could see the flash of sword blades, in the light of an oil lamp. \"Come along, Hugh; that is a woman\u0027s scream.\" \"Better not interfere, Master Rupert,\" Hugh said. But Rupert had already darted off, and Hugh without a moment\u0027s hesitation followed in his steps. At the end of the street they came upon a sedan chair. The two porters stood surlily against the wall, menaced by the drawn swords of two men standing over them; while two other men--evidently of higher rank, but enveloped in cloaks--were forcibly dragging a lady from the chair. They had thrown a cloak over her head to drown her cries. As the lads came up, one of the men uttered a furious oath. \"Rolf, Simon! leave those fellows and keep these springalls back. They are but boys. I will whistle when I am in the boat. \"Now, mistress!\" and he began to carry the lady away. As the lads arrived, the servitors--for such they were by their appearance--leaving the chairmen, turned upon them. One of the chairmen at once ran off as fast as his legs could carry him; but the other, a sturdy fellow, leaped on the back of the man who had been guarding him, as the latter turned upon Rupert. Hugh was attacked by the other. \"Be careful, Hugh! keep out of reach of his point,\" Rupert cried; and darting past, he struck the man who had hold of the lady a sharp blow across the ankle, which brought him instantly to the ground with his burden. The other gentleman drew his sword, and rushed upon Rupert. It was fortunate for the latter that he had chosen his stick for lightness and balance, for it moved as quickly and easily as a foil. Without a thought of guarding, his assailant rushed at him to run him through; but Rupert parried the thrust, and in turn drove the end of his stick, with all his force, into his opponent\u0027s stomach. The man instantaneously doubled up with a low cry, and fell on the ground. Then the other man, who had by this time risen to his feet, in turn rushed furiously at Rupert. A few times the sword and stick scraped and rasped against each other, and then Rupert lunged full at the other\u0027s face. There was a loud cry, an oath, and then, as the sound of the watch running down the street, led by the chairman who had run away, was heard, the man took to his feet and fled. The lackey who had engaged Hugh, and who had in vain endeavoured to get to close quarters with the lad, imitated his example; but the prostrate man on the ground, and the fellow held by the chairman, were seized by the watch. Rupert turned to the young lady, who, having now disencumbered herself of the folds of the cloak over her head, was leaning, half fainting, against the chair. Taking off his hat and bowing deeply, he expressed his hope that she had suffered no harm through the unmannerly assault upon her. \"I thank you greatly, sir,\" she said, speaking with a slightly foreign accent. \"I am unhurt, although somewhat breathless. I owe you my deep gratitude for rescue from these evil-minded men.\" \"What may be your name, mistress?\" one of the watch asked. \"You will be needed tomorrow to testify against these men.\" \"My name is Maria Von Duyk, and I reside at present with the worthy alderman, Peter Hawkins, to whom I was returning in the chair, as the chairmen will tell you, after a visit to Mistress Vanloct, whose house we had just left when molested.\" \"And yours, young sir?\" the watchman asked. \"My name is Rupert Holliday. I am staying at the Bell, in Bishopsgate Street.\" \"You will both have to be present tomorrow morning before the worshipful magistrate Master Forman, at Westminster.\" The watch now secured the man on the ground, who was recovering from the effect of the violent thrust in the stomach, and putting handcuffs on him and the other, led them away. \"You will permit me, I trust, to escort you to your door,\" Rupert said, as he ceremoniously handed the young lady into her chair. \"Yes, indeed, sir; and I trust that you will enter, and allow Dame Hawkins to add her thanks to mine.\" Rupert bowed, and the chair being closed the chairmen lifted it, and with Rupert and Hugh following, proceeded eastward. When they arrived at the house of Alderman Hawkins, in Lawrence Pulteney, the young lady on alighting begged Rupert to enter; but the latter excused himself on account of the hour, but said that he would call next morning, and would, if allowed, accompany her and the alderman to give evidence as to the assault. On arriving next morning, Rupert was overwhelmed with thanks by the alderman, his wife, and Mistress Maria Von Duyk, all of whom were much surprised at his youth, for in the dim light of the preceding evening the young lady had not perceived that her rescuer was a mere lad. Rupert found that there was no occasion to go before the magistrate, for the alderman having sent down early to the watch house to inquire at what hour their presence would be required, found that the prisoners had been rescued, on their way to the watch house, by a party of armed men. \"We are,\" the alderman said, \"well aware who was the leader of the assailants, the man who escaped. Sir Richard Fulke is a ruined gamester, and is a distant relation of Dame Vanloct, whom my young friend was yesterday visiting. Knowing the wealth of Mistress Von Duyk\u0027s good father, he has sought to mend his ruined fortune by a match with her. At the urgent request of Mistress Von Duyk I wrote to him, saying that his attentions were unpleasing to her, and that they must be discontinued, or that she could no longer visit at Dame Vanloct\u0027s where she usually had met him. This was a week since. He replied courteously, regretting that the deep devotion he felt was unrequited, but withdrawing from the undertaking of trying to win her, and promising that henceforth she should be no longer troubled with his presence when she visited Dame Vanloct. This was of course done to lull our suspicion. When the chair was stopped yesterday, Maria at once recognized his voice. As they dragged her from the chair, he said: \"\u0027Quick! hurry her down to the boat.\u0027 \"There is no doubt upon my mind that he intended to carry her off, and to compel her to marry him. I bethought me at first of applying to the secretary of state for a warrant for his arrest to answer for this outrage, but Mistress Maria leaves us tomorrow for Holland, and the process would delay her departure, and would cause a scandal and talk very unpleasant to herself, and which would greatly offend my good friend her father. Had the men in custody been brought up this morning, there would have been no choice but to have carried the matter through. It was then a relief to us to find that they had escaped. I have told you this, young sir, as your due after having rescued Mistress Von Duyk from so great a peril. Now, as to yourself, believe me if my friendship and assistance can in any way advantage you, they are at your service. Even of your name I am yet in ignorance.\" Rupert thanked the worthy alderman, and then stated that he was the grandson of Colonel Holliday, of Windthorpe Chace, in Derbyshire, and had come up to London to wait upon the Earl of Marlborough, who had promised him his protection and a cornetcy in a regiment of horse for service in Holland. \"In that case, sir,\" Mistress Von Duyk said, \"it is like you may come to Dort. If so, believe me that my father, whom I shall tell how much we are indebted to you, will not be backward in manifesting his gratitude for the great service that you have rendered to his daughter.\" \"How were you thinking of passing the day?\" the alderman asked. \"I had no plan,\" Rupert said. \"In truth, I am waiting to call upon the Earl of Marlborough until Master Haliford has fashioned me a suit of clothes fitted for such an occasion; he has promised them for this evening.\" \"Would it please you to go down the river? I have a boat, and if you would like to see the shipping of this great port, and the palace at Greenwich for our seamen, my boatmen will take you down; and you will, I trust, return and take your midday meal with us.\" And so it was arranged; and as Rupert and Hugh were rowed down the river, lost in wonder at the numerous craft that lay there, Hugh admitted that Rupert\u0027s interference in a business which was no concern of his had turned out a fortunate occurrence. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3111/85653.html","bookId":933,"book":{"id":933,"title":"The Cornet of Horse","description":"简介： One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four--turn to your lady; one, two, three, four--now deep reverence.
