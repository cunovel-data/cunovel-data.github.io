{"id":93529,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"CHAPTER 1\n Schuyler\n There had been little time to mourn. Upon returning to New York after Lawrence\u0027s murder in Rio (covered up by the Committee with a proper obituary in the Times), Schuyler Van Alen had been on the run. No rest. No respite. A year of constant motion, barely one step ahead of the Venators hunting her. A flight to Buenos Aires followed by one to Dubai. A sleepless night in a youth hostel in Amsterdam followed by another in a bunk bed in an auditorium in Bruges.\n She had marked her sixteenth birthday aboard the Trans-Siberian Railway, celebrating with a cup of watery Nescaf¨¦ coffee and several crumbly Russian tea cookies. Somehow, her best friend, Oliver Hazard-Perry, had found a candle to light in one of the suharkies. He took his job as human Conduit pretty seriously. It was thanks to Oliver\u0027s careful accounting that they had been able to stretch their money so far. The Conclave had frozen his access to the well-funded Hazard-Perry accounts as soon as they had left New York.\n Now it was August in Paris, and hot. They had arrived to find most of the city a ghost town: bakeries, boutiques, and bistros shuttered while their proprietors absconded to three-week vacations in the beaches up north. The only people around were American and Japanese tourists, who mobbed every museum gallery, every garden in every public square, inescapable and ubiquitous in their white sneakers and baseball caps. But Schuyler welcomed their presence. She hoped the slow-moving crowds would make it easier for her and Oliver to spot their Venator pursuers. Schuyler had been able to disguise herself by changing her physical features, but performing the mutatio was taking a toll on her. She didn\u0027t say anything to Oliver, but lately she couldn\u0027t even do so much as change the color of her eyes.\n And now, after almost a year of hiding, they were coming out into the open. It was a gamble, but they were desperate. Living without the protection and wisdom of the secret society of vampires and their select group of trusted humans had taken its toll. And while neither of them would ever admit it, they were both tired of running.\n So for now Schuyler was seated in the back of a bus, wearing a pressed white shirt buttoned to the neck over slim black pants and flat black shoes with rubber soles. Her dark hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and except for a hint of lip gloss, she wore no makeup. She meant to blend in with the rest of the catering staff who had been hired for the evening. But surely someone would notice. Surely someone would hear how hard her heart was beating, would remark on how her breathing was shallow and quick. She had to calm down. She had to clear her mind and become the blas¨¦ contract caterer she was pretending to be. For so many years Schuyler had excelled at being invisible. This time, her life depended on it. The bus was taking them over a bridge to the H\u0027tel Lambert on the isle Saint-Louis, a small island on the Seine River. The Lambert was the most beautiful house in the most beautiful city in the world. At least, she had always thought so. Although \"house\" was putting it mildly. \"Castle\" was more like it, something out of a fairy tale, its massive river walls and gray mansard roofs rising from the surrounding mist. As a child she had played hide-and-seek in the formal gardens, where the conical sculpted trees reminded her of figures on a chessboard. She remembered staging imaginary productions inside the grand courtyard and throwing bread crumbs to the geese from the terrace overlooking the Seine. How she had taken that life for granted! Tonight she would not enter the hotel\u0027s exclusive, exalted domain as an invited guest, but rather as a humble servant. Like a mouse creeping into a hole. Schuyler was anxious by nature, and she needed almost all her self-control to keep it together. At any moment she feared she might scream, she was already so nervous she couldn\u0027t stop her hands from trembling. They vibrated, fluttering in her lap like trapped birds.\n Next to her, Oliver was handsome in a bartender\u0027s uniform, a tuxedo with a black silk bow tie and silver shirt studs. But he was pale beneath his butterfly collar, his shoulders tense under a jacket that was a little too big. His clear hazel eyes were clouded, looking more gray than green. Oliver\u0027s face did not display the same blank, bored look as the others. He was alert, ready for a fight or flight. Anyone who looked at him long enough could see it.\n We shouldn\u0027t be here, Schuyler thought. What were we thinking? The risk is too great. They\u0027re going to find us and separate us... and then... well, the rest was too horrible to contemplate.\n She was sweating under her starched shirt. The air-conditioning wasn\u0027t working, and the bus was packed. She leaned her head against the windowpane. Lawrence had been dead for over a year now. Four hundred forty-five days. Schuyler kept count, thinking that maybe once she hit a magical number, it would stop hurting.\n This was no game, although sometimes it felt like a horrid, surreal version of cat and mouse. Oliver put a hand on top of hers to try and stop her hands from shaking. The tremors had begun a few months ago, just a slight twitching, but soon she realized she had to concentrate whenever she did something as simple as pick up a fork or open an envelope. She knew what it was, and there was nothing she could do about it. Dr. Pat had told her the first time she visited her office: she was the only one of her kind, Dimidium Cognato, the first half-blood, and there was no telling how her human body would react to the transformation into immortal; there would be side effects, obstacles particular to her case. Still, she felt better once Oliver held her hand in his. He always knew what to do. She depended on him for so much, and her love for him had only deepened in the year they had spent together. She squeezed his hand, intertwined her fingers around his. It was his blood that ran through her veins, his quick thinking that had secured her freedom.\n As for everyone and everything they had left behind in New York, Schuyler did not dwell on it anymore. All of that was in the past. She had made her choice and was at peace with it. She had accepted her life for what it was. Once in a while she missed her friend Bliss very keenly, and more than once wanted to get in touch with her, but that was out of the question. No one could know where they were. No one. Not even Bliss.\n Maybe they would be lucky tonight. Their luck had held so far. Oh, there had been a few close calls here and there, that one evening in Cologne when she\u0027d abruptly run from a woman who had asked for directions to the cathedral. Illuminata had given the agent away. Schuyler had caught that soft imperceptible glow in the twilight before booking as fast as she could. Disguises only went so far. At some point, your true nature revealed itself.\n Wasn\u0027t that what the Inquisitor had argued during the official investigation into the events in Rio? That maybe Schuyler wasn\u0027t who she was supposed to be?\n Outlaw. Fugitive. That\u0027s what she was now. Certainly not Lawrence Van Alen\u0027s grieving granddaughter.\n No.\n According to the Conclave, she was his killer.\n CHAPTER 2\n Mimi\n Oh, gross! She\u0027d stepped in something icky. Beyond icky. It squished beneath her foot, a wet, gasping sound. Whatever it was, it was sure to ruin her pony-hair boots. What was she doing wearing pony-hair boots to a reconnaissance mission anyway? Mimi Force lifted her heel and assessed the damage. The zebra pattern was stained with something brown and leaky.\n Beer? Whiskey? A combination of all the bottom-shelf alcohol they served in this place? Who knew? For the umpteenth time this year, she wondered why on earth she\u0027d ever signed up for this assignment. It was the last week of August. By all rights she should be on a beach in Capri, working on her tan and her fifth limoncello. Not creeping around some honky-tonk bar in the middle of the country. Somewhere between the dust bowl and the rust belt, or was it the rust bowl and the dust belt? Wherever they were, it was a sleepy, sad little place, and Mimi couldn\u0027t wait to leave it.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Kingsley Martin nudged her. \u0027shoes too tight again?\"\n \"Will you leave me alone?\" she sighed, moving away from him, making it clear she found the alcove they were hiding in too close quarters. She was tired of his teasing. Especially since, to her complete and utter horror, she discovered she was starting to like it. That was simply unacceptable. She hated Kingsley Martin. After everything that he\u0027d done to her, she couldn\u0027t see how she could feel otherwise.\n \"But where\u0027s the fun in that?\" He winked. The most infuriating thing about Kingsley, other than the fact that he had once tried to bring about her demise, was that somewhere between chasing down leads on the beaches of Punta del Este or through the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, Mimi had started to find him... attractive. It was enough to make her stomach turn.\n \"C\u0027mon, Force, lighten up. You know you want me,\" he said with a smug smile.\n \"Oh my god!\" she huffed, turning around so that her long blond hair whipped over her shoulder and hit him square in the face. \"As if!\"\n He might be faster and stronger than she was, the big man on the Venator team, and for all intents and purposes her boss, but really she should be the one leading them, as she outranked him in the Conclave hierarchy. If you could call that sorry group of cowards a Conclave.\n Kingsley Martin had another think coming if he thought he had any chance with her. He might be too cute for words (damn those rock-star looks), but it didn\u0027t matter one iota. She was not interested, no matter how much her pulse quickened whenever he was near. She was bound to another.\n \"Mmm. Nice. You don\u0027t use the hotel shampoo from the airport Hilton, do you? This is the good stuff,\" he purred. \"But is it the conditioner that makes it so soft and silky?\"\n \"Shut up... just?\"\n \"Hold on. Save your speech for the after-party. I see our guy. You ready?\" Kingsley interrupted, his voice serious now, controlled.\n \"Like a shot.\" Mimi nodded, all business as well. She saw their witness, the reason they were a few miles outside of Lincoln, Nebraska (that was it! She remembered now) in the first place. A former frat boy, probably just shy of thirty, with a baby beer gut and the beginnings of middle-age \"carb face\" He was the type of guy who looked like he\u0027d played cornerback in high school, but whose pounds of muscle had turned to fat after a few years behind a desk.\n \"Good, because this is not going to be easy,\" Kingsley warned. \"Okay, the boys will bring him to that corner booth and we\u0027ll follow. Square him off and then go. No one will notice as long as we don\u0027t get up. Waitress won\u0027t even bother to come around.\"\n It was easier and more painless to enter the mind of another during REM sleep, but they didn\u0027t have the luxury of waiting until their suspect had drifted off to la-la land.\n Instead they planned to barge into his subconscious with no warning and no consideration. Better that way: there would be no place for him to hide. No time to prepare. They wanted the unadulterated truth, and this time they were going to get it.\n The Venators were truth-tellers, skilled in the ability to decipher dreams and access memories. While only a bloodletting would allow them to tell true memory from false, there were other, quicker ways to discriminate fact from fiction without having to resort to the Sacred Kiss. Mimi learned that the Committee only consented to the blood trial when a most grievous charge had been levied, as in her case. Otherwise, the practice of memory hunting, venatio, while not infallible, was acceptable for their purposes. Mimi had been given a crash course in Venator training before joining up. It helped that she had been one in previous lifetimes. Once she had relearned the basics, it was just like riding a bike, her core memories kicked in and the whole exercise became second nature.\n Mimi watched as Sam and Ted Lennox, the twin brothers who rounded out their Venator team, led their witness to a dark corner booth. They had been plying him with pitcher after pitcher of beer at the bar. Mr. Glory Days probably thought he\u0027d just made a couple of new friends. As soon as they sat down, Kingsley slipped into the opposite bench, Mimi right next to him.\n \"Hey, buddy, remember us?\" he asked.\n \"Huh?\" The guy was awake, but drunk and drowsy. Mimi felt a twinge of pity. He had no idea what was about to happen.\n \"I\u0027m sure you remember her,\" Kingsley said, guiding the witness to lock eyes with Mimi.\n Mimi held Frat Boy with her shoulder, and for all anyone in the real world knew, the dude was just entranced with the pretty blonde, staring deep into her green eyes.\n \"Now,\" Kingsley ordered.\n Without a moment to spare, the four Venators stepped into the glom, taking the witness with them. It was as easy as slipping down the rabbit hole. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-van-alen-legacy-blue-bloods-4/page-2.html","bookId":2122,"book":{"id":2122,"title":"The Van Alen Legacy (Blue Bloods #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Van Alen Legacy (Blue Bloods #4) \n This book was an excellent addition to the series.
