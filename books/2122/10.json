She\u0027s written a cell phone novel? What does it say?\"\n He quieted her with a look and showed them the letter. One line, written in the same beautiful calligraphy. Phoebus ostend praeeo.\n Phoebus was the name of the sun king in the old tongue, Mimi knew, and the rest was easy enough to understand.\n \"The sun shall show the way,\" she said. \"What does it mean?\"\n In answer, Kingsley folded up the note carefully and tucked it into his jacket pocket.\n He has no idea, does he, Mimi thought. \"Why would the Watcher take the trouble to send us a note but then have the note be nonsense?\" she asked, annoyed. \"And how did she know I was coming? And bringing a stuffed toy?\"\n \"You forget. The Watcher can see into the future. If she was being held by Silver Bloods, as she surely was, she must have felt threatened enough to allow only the most cryptic of communications.\"\n \"It\u0027s a riddle. A clue,\" Ted said suddenly. \"A clue to her whereabouts. \u0027the sun shall show the way.\"\n It was the longest sentence he had said in a year. Even Sam looked surprised to find his brother so garrulous. Kingsley nodded.\n \"Of course. Sophia always did say wisdom had to be earned.\"\n A riddle. Great. A year of tracking down the Watcher, and when they finally get somewhere, they find some kind of one-eyed sphinx blocking the path. Could it have hurt her to have written Am being held captive at 101 Favela Lane! Come soon and bring a Luna Bar! Or was that just too much to ask?\n \"You make light of trivial matters\", Kingsley sent.\n \"Just trying to keep things interesting\", Mimi telepathed in return. \"And get out of my head. You don\u0027t belong here.\"\n Meanwhile, the other Venators were deep in the glom, consulting their memories, trying to ascertain the meaning behind the words. Finally, Ted opened his eyes and spoke.\n \"There\u0027s a bar not too far away called El Sol de Ajuste. The Setting Sun.\"\n \"So?\" Mimi said.\n \"It\u0027s an old Silver Blood expression, the setting sun describes Lucifer\u0027s fall to Earth,\" Kingsley explained. \u0027That could be it.\"\n Right, Mimi remembered. Lucifer was the Prince of Heaven. The Morningstar. It made sense that to the Silver Bloods, his doom was akin to the setting sun.\n \"Well, what are we waiting for?\" Mimi asked. \"We\u0027ve got a missing Watcher to find, and I don\u0027t know about you guys, but I need a drink.\"\n CHAPTER 18\n Schuyler\n \"There\u0027s nothing to fear. Please don\u0027t run from me again.\" Jack\u0027s breath was hot in her ear, and Schuyler felt each word as a caress. But his hands did not release their hold, his fingers gripped tightly around her arms.\n \"Let me go!\" she said. \"You\u0027re hurting me.\"\n She gasped, even though, to her surprise, her tremors had lessened the moment he\u0027d touched her. She felt his grip loosen, and part of her sagged a little that he had given in so quickly. That damnable, hateful part of her that missed his touch the moment it was withdrawn. She hugged herself, trying not to feel so abandoned. Why did she feel this way? She was the one who had spurned him. She was the one who had left. Jack was nothing to her now. Nothing.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he whispered. \"What\u0027s wrong? Are you okay?\" He looked at her carefully. \"You\u0027re trembling.\"\n \"It\u0027s just this thing... I get shaky sometimes... it\u0027s nothing,\" she said. She turned to face him directly. \"Anyway, I\u0027m not going back. I\u0027m not going back to New York.\"\n To her surprise, Jack suddenly looked relieved, as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders.\n \"Is that why you\u0027ve been running? Because you thought I was taking you back to New York? That\u0027s not why I\u0027m here at all.\"\n Now it was her turn to be confused. \u0027Then why?\"\n \"You really don\u0027t know?\" Jack asked.\n She shook her head.\n \"You\u0027re in danger here, Schuyler,\" he said, looking around warily. \u0027there are Silver Bloods all around. Can\u0027t you feel them? Their hunger?\" The minute he said it, she could feel exactly what he was talking about, that deep and consuming voraciousness, an unabated wanting.\n So that\u0027s what she\u0027d felt at the party, a bottomless appetite of greed and sex and desire, that spellbinding siren call to depravity. It hummed in the background, like a noise you couldn\u0027t make out but knew was there. Croatan. So she did have reason to be afraid. She had felt it.\n Jack had backed her into a corner of the prison cell, and Schuyler was starting to feel claustrophobic in the small space. She knew instinctively that many souls had suffered and died in the same place she was standing now. She could feel the primal pain, an unmistakable sense of injustice. Back then prisoners were sent to the dungeons to die, rotting underground, never to see the sun.\n How funny that the Conspiracy made humans believe vampires feared the sun, when the opposite was true. They had loved it so much they had been exiled from heaven because of their love of Lucifer\u0027s light. Schuyler shivered as Jack continued to explain.\n \u0027The party has been compromised. They\u0027re here for you.\"\n \"But why do the Silver Bloods even care about me? What\u0027s so important about me?\" Schuyler asked, trying not to sound petulant and self-pitying. Why her? She hadn\u0027t chosen this. All she\u0027d ever wanted was to be left in peace, but it was as if she had been born already a target.\n When Jack answered, it was with the assurance and gravity of a much older presence, revealing a small glimpse into the very ancient creature behind the young vampire mask. What had Lawrence called him? Abbadon. The Angel of Destruction. The Angel of the Apocalypse. One of the most fearsome of Lucifer\u0027s former generals.\n \"The cycles are the key to our existence; they guarantee our continued invisibility in the human world. According to the Code, the expression of each spirit is closely monitored and recorded. There are lists and rules that govern who is called up, and by whom and when. There was no record of Allegra being allowed to bear a daughter in this cycle. So the mere fact that you were born was already a violation.\"\n From birth she had been a mistake, Schuyler thought. Her mother... that still, silent figure in the hospital bed... why did she choose to have me? Schuyler wondered.\n \"But so what? That still doesn\u0027t explain it. Why would they even care about that? What\u0027s it to them? It doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\n \"I know,\" Jack sighed.\n \"You\u0027re not telling me everything,\" Schuyler realized. He was protecting her. \u0027tell me the truth. There has to be a reason why they\u0027ve been trying to kill me.\"\n Jack hung his head. Finally he spoke. \"A long time ago, during the crisis in Rome, the Pistis Sophia saw the future. She said that one day, the irrevocable bond among the Uncorrupted would break. That Gabrielle would spurn Michael and bear a daughter with a Red Blood. And that daughter would be the death of the Silver Bloods. Sophia has never been wrong.\"\n \"So I\u0027m their death?\" Schuyler found it absurdly funny. \"Me? They\u0027re scared... of me?\" A half-hysterical yelp escaped before she could stop herself. It was so absolutely ridiculous. What could she do to harm them? As the Inquisitor had pointed out, she had used her mother\u0027s sword and missed. She might be fast and strong and light, but she was not a fighter, not a warrior, not a soldier.\n Jack crossed his arms. \"It\u0027s nothing to laugh about. Leviathan would have killed you right there that night in Rio if he had known who you were. And now that he knows he was so close and failed to kill you, he\u0027s tracked you down here to finish the job.\"\n \"But how do you know Leviathan has tracked me?\"\n \"Because I have been tracking Leviathan,\" Jack said grimly. \"My father and I have been tracking him for months.\"\n \"Charles is here?\" she asked. She wondered why the news did not make her feel safer. Charles Force was the greatest of them all. He was Michael, Pure of Heart, the Valiant, Prince of the Angels, Supreme Commander of the Lord\u0027s Army. She had been looking for Charles herself, and to know that he was here in Paris, and as her protector, or one of them, anyway, should have gladdened her heart. But it did not.\n Charles Force was not a friend. He was not an enemy, but he was not a friend either. But maybe now she would be able to find out what Lawrence had asked her to do. Charles would have to tell her about the Van Alen Legacy. Schuyler had to know. She owed her grandfather that much. Jack nodded.\n \"Yes. He decided to come himself when the Conclave would not send the Venators after Leviathan following your testimony. We have been one step and two cities behind him for months. When Leviathan led us here, to this party, we thought he was after the countess, as she was instrumental in bringing about his imprisonment on Corcovado. But when we saw you in the ballroom, we suddenly knew what his real intentions were. Charles sent me to make sure you were safe while he took care of Leviathan himself.\"\n So basically she was in danger from the baddest demon around. Wonderful. She was running from the Venators when she probably should have been running toward them, now that she knew what was truly after her.\n \"So you believe me? You believe that I didn\u0027t kill Lawrence like the Conclave thinks?\" Schuyler asked.\n He looked down. \"I can\u0027t speak for the Conclave. But I have always believed you. I\u0027ve always believed in you,\" he said softly.\n \"Right.\" She nodded, trying to appear businesslike, to hide the fact that she had been moved by his faith. Jack believed her. He was on her side. He didn\u0027t hate her, at least. He didn\u0027t hate her for breaking his heart. \"So what now?\"\n \"First things first,\" he said briskly. \"Let\u0027s get out of this dungeon. I was worried you would choose this place to hide. And I think you\u0027ve noticed it smells pretty awful down here.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-van-alen-legacy-blue-bloods-4/page-10.html","bookId":2122,"book":{"id":2122,"title":"The Van Alen Legacy (Blue Bloods #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Van Alen Legacy (Blue Bloods #4) \n This book was an excellent addition to the series.
