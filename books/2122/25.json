John\u0027s Cathedral, the Met reception, the Boys Choir of Harlem, the Peter Duchin Orchestra, and a dozen other details, had all been decided upon a year ago. It was simply a matter of securing a new date and rehiring vendors, most of whom were more than happy to take her security deposit once again. The bonding was set for mid-October, the earliest date that worked for everyone.\\n\\n But Mimi wasn\u0027t thinking of her upcoming bonding as she sat in the lobby of the Mandarin Oriental hotel, waiting for Kingsley Martin to arrive that evening. It was the farthest thing from her mind, almost as if the whole bonding scenario were simply a role she would step into at the right moment, like a glass slipper that had to fit. But until then, she could do as she pleased.\\n\\n The Repository aide who had unearthed the tape recorder that was able to play the tapes from Charles\u0027s study had advised her to go easy on it; it was the only one they had left. He couldn\u0027t even let her take it out of the building.\\n\\n \"Venators don\u0027t like to upgrade,\" he\u0027d grumbled, handing her the bulky black object. \"We\u0027ve given them the attachments for their phones, but they still use their old junk to turn stuff in. Someone gave us a report on parchment the other day. In longhand. You know how hard that is to read? Let alone retype?\"\\n\\n Mimi had murmured sympathies, and then found an empty cubicle and some headphones. She started to listen.\\n\\n She had spent almost the entire night at the Repository, leaving only so she wouldn\u0027t miss her first class.\\n\\n When Kingsley finally walked in, she wondered why it was that almost every time she was with him, she had been awake for more than twenty four hours.\\n\\n As he sauntered over, Mimi noticed how everyone at the bar turned to gape at him. Talk about using the glamour.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re late,\" she said, tapping at her watch.\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re just early.\" Kingsley smiled and slid in next to her on the banquette.\\n\\n She inched away from him. \"Aren\u0027t you staying at this hotel? You don\u0027t even have an excuse. I\u0027ve been waiting for over an hour for you.\"\\n\\n And Mimi Force did not wait for anyone. It was a new and frustrating experience. She\u0027d read the looks of pity from the cocktail waitress.\\n\\n Kingsley yawned. \"I know you\u0027re not here to talk about my inability to master time management. So what\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"Order first,\" Mimi snarled, as the waitress glided up to their table. Mimi noticed the girl was already making eyes at Kingsley.\\n\\n \"Macallan. Straight. And whatever the lady desires,\" Kingsley said, winking at Mimi.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have a dirty martini,\" Mimi said.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027ll have to see your ID,\" the waitress said with a fake smile.\\n\\n I have never been carded in my life! Mimi wanted to scream. This is New York City! Do you even have any idea how old I am? But before Mimi could say anything, or use the glom to her advantage, Kingsley reached over and snagged her purse and plucked out Mimi\u0027s driver\u0027s license to hand to the waitress. The girl didn\u0027t even bother to look at it.\\n\\n \"Whiskey and a martini coming right up.\"\\n\\n \"Smooth. What did you do? Change the date?\" Mimi asked. Some vampires had the ability to transform inanimate objects. Mimi would have loved that talent. Imagine all the knockoffs she could turn into real Birkins! She\u0027d make a fortune.\\n\\n \"Nah. No need. She just wanted to mess with you. It\u0027s my attention she was after.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re really something else, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Kingsley grinned. \"I\u0027ve missed you, Force. You still mad at me from last time? I hope not. No hard feelings, yeah?\"\\n\\n She snorted, but it was hard to stay mad at him when he was smiling at her like that.\\n\\n Their drinks came with no further flirtation from the waitress. Mimi took a sip of hers. Meanwhile, Kingsley had somehow managed it so that she was practically sitting on his lap at their cozy table.\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" she said, pushing off. \"I want to talk to you about something serious.\"\\n\\n \"That sounds boring,\" he sighed. \"I was hoping you wanted to talk about something else.\"\\n\\n \"Listen. I found the tapes. Your reports from two years ago. They were in Charles\u0027s office,\" Mimi said, looking him square in the eye.\\n\\n \"Spying on me now?\" Kingsley cocked an eyebrow and finished off his whiskey in one gulp. But he sat up straight and looked alert. With his right hand he motioned for the check.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand?\" she whispered fiercely. \"What were you doing for Charles? Why did you call the Silver Blood? What were the two of you trying to do?\"\\n\\n \"Do you really want to know?\" Kingsley asked. He returned her forthright stare, so she could look right into his dark eyes. She could see the hint of silver at the edge of his pupils.\\n\\n Mimi didn\u0027t blink. \"Yes. Tell me. Tell me everything.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 48\\n\\n Bliss\\n\\n The Prada sample sale, while admittedly an exclusive experience (they checked two IDs against the guest list at the door) and filled to the brim with last season\u0027s must-haves, struck Bliss as completely anticlimactic. Where were the hordes of fashion-mad women fighting over the last pair of six-inch embroidered platforms? Was the lack of buzz because the economy was in a downturn, or maybe because sample sales were inherently secretly lame? Filled with overstock of designs whose life expectancy rate was the three months that fashionistas actually wore the stuff.\\n\\n Because who needed a degrade skirt when it was no longer in fashion? Or for that matter, vertiginious pumps in a crocodile pattern that turned a foot into a hoof .\\n\\n Was it still fashion when it was no longer fashionable?\\n\\n Bliss wandered around the shelves, pulling a bag to look at here and there. Four hundred dollars was still too much to pay for a handbag, she thought. They called this a sample sale? A dress caught her eye, one of those babydoll dresses that had looked so cute in the advertising campaign. Purple with yellow flowers. She picked it up.\\n\\n When Schuyler walked in, dressed in her various layers but looking as ethereal and beautiful as ever, Bliss could see the envy from all the other insect-sized fashionistas, which made her feel proud and happy. Seeing Schuyler reminded Bliss that she wasn\u0027t some centuries-old freak, some cursed being... that part of her was only sixteen years old and still innocent, and no one else, no one else in this room, would understand what she was going through....\\n\\n Except for the girl in the gray trenchcoat and black sweater.\\n\\n \"Bliss! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god?\" Schuyler cried, and soon they were embracing, hugging each other tightly, tears flowing down their cheeks, making a bit of a commotion so that the other shoppers turned away and tried to pretend they weren\u0027t gawking.\\n\\n \"Do we have to stay here?\" Schuyler asked, looking curiously at Bliss. \"Are you buying that dress?\"\\n\\n \"I might... Why? Do you not like it? But no, I mean yes, it\u0027s better if we stay here... but I think there\u0027s a room where we can talk,\" Bliss said, leading Schuyler outside to the hallway and into a little anteroom on the side.\\n\\n They sat side by side, still clutching each other. Bliss noticed how thin Schuyler had gotten.\\n\\n \"When I heard you guys had to run away, I was so worried. What happened?\"\\n\\n She listened while Schuyler told her about the investigation and all that had happened afterward. As she did, she realized more and more what a danger she was posing to Schuyler. Even without the title, Forsyth was already leading the Conclave. Bliss could feel the Visitor behind it all. But why would he care what happened to Schuyler Van Alen?\\n\\n \"I saw Oliver at school, but we haven\u0027t had a chance to get together,\" Bliss said.\\n\\n She\u0027d had an awkward reunion with him. They were friends-inlaw, Bliss thought. Without Schuyler, she and Oliver didn\u0027t have too much in common.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s weird to see him without you. You guys were always joined at the hip.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Schuyler said, and twisted her thumbs. \"It\u0027s better this way. If the Conclave knew I was back...\"\\n\\n Bliss nodded. Forsyth had been asking her if Schuyler had been in touch, which meant the Conclave was still interested in her whereabouts. Bliss had told him nothing, of course. Schuyler was right to hide. But Bliss had a feeling there was something other than just fear of the Conclave that was keeping Schuyler and Oliver apart. She\u0027d once hoped that Schuyler would find happiness with Oliver, but friendship was one thing, and love was another. The Greeks were right about that.\\n\\n \"Have you seen Jack?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Schuyler hesitated. \"It\u0027s fine. It\u0027s... we\u0027re... it\u0027s over.\"\\n\\n She looked Bliss straight in the eyes when she said it and held her head high.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad to hear that,\" Bliss said gently.\\n\\n The Force twins were finally going to be bonded, and she could imagine how much that had to hurt. Mimi had even asked Bliss to be one of her bondsmaids, which was unexpected since they hardly spoke to each other anymore. Bliss had said yes to be polite.\\n\\n \"And you? I... I\u0027m sorry we never got to talk about what happened to Dylan. I can only imagine how terrible...\" Schuyler\u0027s voice trailed off and her eyes grew bright. \"I\u0027m really sorry I haven\u0027t been there for you. I didn\u0027t want you to be alone after that, but we didn\u0027t have much of a choice.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay. I\u0027m all right. I really missed you guys. It\u0027s been... kind of crazy for me....\" she said. Inside Bliss\u0027s head a familiar voice said, Tell her I say hello, which made Bliss smile. \"Anyway, sometimes I feel like he\u0027s still with me.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll always be with you,\" Schuyler said, grasping for Bliss\u0027s hand and squeezing it.\\n\\n Bliss leaned over so they could speak more intimately. She could feel the darkness coming, a sensation not unlike reaching the precipice of a roller coaster. Hanging over the abyss, right before the drop.\\n\\n \"Listen, Sky, I need to tell you something. There\u0027s something wrong with me. I can\u0027t talk about it too much, or whatever is wrong with me will put you in a lot of danger. But I\u0027m taking this class... Ancient Civilizations... and I was reading about Rome... and I started to remember some stuff... stuff that happened before, and I think it might-\" she was going to say, \"might be happening again,\" but she never had a chance because Schuyler\u0027s iPhone began to ring.\\n\\n \"Hold on. God, I\u0027m so sorry. Bliss, I have to take it. It\u0027s my mother\u0027s hospital,\" Schuyler said, checking the number. She put the phone to her ear. \"Hello? Yes, this is Schuyler Van Alen.... What? Sorry? Yes... yes of course... I\u0027ll come right now.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" asked Bliss.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s - it\u0027s my mother. She\u0027s awake! She\u0027s asking for me. Bliss, I\u0027m sorry, I have to go!\"\\n\\n Allegra? Allegra\u0027s awake? Wait\u0027schuyler! Let me come with you?\" But it was too late. Her friend had gone so fast it was as if she had disappeared into thin air. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-van-alen-legacy-blue-bloods-4/page-25.html","bookId":2122,"book":{"id":2122,"title":"The Van Alen Legacy (Blue Bloods #4)","description":"Storyline: The Van Alen Legacy (Blue Bloods #4) \\n This book was an excellent addition to the series.
