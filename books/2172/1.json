The Warrior\u0027s Union thugs were professionals, if he passed out he simply wasted their time. In his three days at their hands he had never passed out. They knew that he was no good to them right from the start. The rest of his agony had been the penalty he paid for wasting their time. When they were through tormenting him at last they hooked him up, as he knew they would, to the obsidian cliff below the high reaches. Subversives were often hooked up to die in full view of the settlement as a lesson - the exact meaning of the lesson was never clear.\\n\\n The three from the Warrior\u0027s Union hooked him up there in the dark, as they\u0027d taken him in the dark, and Jephtha thought them cowards for this. His left eyelid was less swollen than the right, and he managed to work it open. A pale hint of dawn pried the starry sky away from the black cheek of the sea. Predawn lights of a commuter ferry wallowed at the dark dockside down below him in the settlement. Like the rest, it loaded up the shift changes of workers at Project Voidship.\\n\\n Running lights from the submersible ferries flickered the night sea\u0027s blackness all the way from the settlement at Kalaloch out to the project\u0027s launch tower complex. A maze of organic dikes and rock jetties fanned out both up- and downcoast of Kalaloch, supporting the new aquaculture projects of Merman Mercantile, none of which had hired Jephtha after his fishing gear had been seized and his license revoked. His partner had kept a couple of fish for himself instead of registering them dockside. The Director\u0027s \"new economy\" prohibited this, and the Director\u0027s henchmen made a lesson of the both of them.\\n\\n Under the opening sky of morning Jephtha felt himself lighten, then separate from his body. He peeled the pain from himself, his self wriggling free of its wounded skin like a molted skreet, and watched the sagging wretch of his flesh from atop a boulder a couple of meters away. This far south, Pandora\u0027s days lasted nearly fourteen hours. He wondered how many more breaths he had left in his sack of cracked ribs and pain.\\n\\n Marica, he thought, my Marica and our three little wots. The Warrior\u0027s Union said they\u0027d hunt them down, too...\\n\\n They would think maybe she had something to tell. They would claim that his woman and their three little ones were dangerous, subversive. They would start on the children to make her talk and she could say nothing, she knew nothing. Jephtha squeezed his good eye closed against his blood and shame.\\n\\n The Director\u0027s \"special squad\" of the Warrior\u0027s Union had pierced Jephtha\u0027s chest and back with maki hooks, steel fishhooks with a cruel incurve the size of his thumb. They caught the glimmer of fresh daylight like armor across his chest. The steel snaffles and cable leaders hung to his knees like a kilt. The glitter of the hooks, as well as the smell of his blood, would attract the dasher that would kill him.\\n\\n Jephtha had caught thousands of maki on hooks like these, set tens of thousands of these ganions on hundreds of longlines. Most of them hung free now, clinking with his movements or the rare morning breeze. His weight hung from two dozen of them - twelve puncturing the skin of his chest, and twelve through his back. He thought this had a significance, too, but they had not told him what it was. But they had told him what he\u0027d wanted to know for years.\\n\\n The Shadows are real! Jephtha played the thought over and over. The Shadows are real!\\n\\n Everyone had heard about these Shadows, but no one he knew had ever met one. Now in the last few months had come the mysterious broadcasts that came on the holo or the telly or the radio made by \"Shadowbox.\" Everybody said those were the work of the Shadows. There were stories in every village about their fight to depose the Director, Raja Flattery, and hamstring his hired muscle. The Nightly News reported daily on Shadow activities: detoured supplies, food theft, sabotage. Anything unpopular or harmful to the Director\u0027s cause was laid at the Shadows\u0027 hatch, including natural disasters. \"Shadowbox,\" using pirated air space and great expertise, reported on the Director.\\n\\n Jephtha had whispered around many a hatchway trying to join up with the Shadows, but no word came forward. \"Shadowbox\" had given him enough hope that he had set out to strike his own blow. He understood, now, that this was how the Shadows worked.\\n\\n He\u0027d wanted to destroy the seat of power itself - the main electrical station between the Director\u0027s private compound and the sprawling manufacturing settlement adjacent to it, Kalaloch.\\n\\n The power station that Jephtha chose was a hydrogen retrieval plant that supplied hydrogen, oxygen and electricity to all of the subcontractors in the Director\u0027s space program. Blowing the plant would set Flattery\u0027s precious Project Voidship and his orbiting factory on its heels for a while. The poor of the town were used to doing without, Jephtha reasoned. Thousands didn\u0027t even have electricity. It would be this new Voidship project and Flattery who would be most crippled. He should have known that the Director\u0027s security had already thought of that.\\n\\n The interrogation had been very old-fashioned, as most of them were. He\u0027d been caught easily and forced to stand naked under a hood for three days while being tortured for nothing. Now a host of steel snaffles clinked against hooks whenever any of his muscles moved. His wounds, for the most part, had stopped bleeding. That just made the flies sting him more. Two poisonous flatwings crawled his left leg, fluttering their wings in some ritual dance, but neither bit.\\n\\n Dashers, he prayed. If it\u0027s anything, let it be dashers and quick. That was what they\u0027d hung him out there for - dasher bait. The hooded dasher would strike him hard, as is their habit, then it would get hung up on the maki hooks and snare itself. The hide would bring a pretty price in the village market. It was an amusement to the security guards, and he\u0027d heard them planning to split the change they\u0027d get for the hide. He didn\u0027t want to be nibbled to death, a dasher would accommodate him nicely. His mouth was so dry from thirst that his lips split every time he coughed.\\n\\n In this hungry downslide of his life Jephtha had dared to hope for two things: to join up with the Shadows, and to glimpse Her Holiness, Crista Galli. He had tried his best with the Shadows. Here, chained to the rocks overlooking the Director\u0027s compound, Jephtha watched the stirrings of the great household through his darkening vision.\\n\\n One of them might be her, he thought. He was lightheaded, and he puffed his chest against the hooks and thought, If I were a Shadow, I\u0027d get her out of there.\\n\\n Crista Galli was the holy innocent, a mysterious young woman born deep in the wild kelp beds twenty-four years ago. When Flattery\u0027s people blew up a rogue kelp bed five years back, Crista Galli surfaced with the debris. How she\u0027d been raised by the kelp underwater and delivered back to humankind was one of those mysteries that Jephtha and his family accepted simply as \"miracle.\"\\n\\n It was rumored that Crista Galli held the hope for Pandora\u0027s salvation. People claimed that she would feed the hungry, heal the sick, comfort the dying. The Director, a Chaplain/Psychiatrist, kept her locked away.\\n\\n \"She needs protection,\" Flattery had said. \"She grew up with the kelp, she needs to know what it is to be human.\"\\n\\n How ironic that Flattery would set out to teach her how to be human. Jephtha knew now, with the clarity of his pain-transcendence, that she was the Director\u0027s prisoner down there as much as all Pandorans were his slaves. Except for now, at the base of the high reaches, Jephtha\u0027s chains had been invisible: hunger chains, propaganda chains, the chain of fear that rattled in his head like cold teeth.\\n\\n He prayed that the security would not find Marica and the wots. The settlement sprawled, people hid people like fish among fish.\\n\\n Mayb...\\n\\n He shook his head, clink-clinking the terrible hooks and snaffles. He felt nothing except the cool breeze that wafted up from morning low tide. It brought the familiar iodine scent of kelp decomposing on the beach.\\n\\n There! At that port high in the main buildin...\\n\\n The glimpse was gone, but Jephtha\u0027s heart raced. His good eye was not focusing and a new darkness was upon him, but he was sure that the form he\u0027d seen had been the pale Crista Galli.\\n\\n She can\u0027t know of this, he thought. If she knew what a monster Raja Flattery is, and she could do it, she would destroy him. Surely if she knew, she would save us all.\\n\\n His thoughts again turned to Marica and the wots. The thoughts were not so much thoughts as dreams. He saw her with the children, hand in hand, traversing an upcoast field in the sunlight. The single sun was bright but not scorching, there were no bugs. Their bare feet were cushioned by the fleshy blossoms of a thousand kinds of flower...\\n\\n A dasher shriek from somewhere below jerked him out of his dream. He knew there was no field without bugs, nowhere on Pandora to stroll barefoot through blossoms. He knew that Vashon security and the Warrior\u0027s Union were known for their persistence, their efficiency, their ruthlessness. They were after his wife and their children, and they would find them. His last hope was that the dasher would find him before they hooked what was left of Marica up here by his side.\\n\\n Again we have let another Chaplain/Psychiatrist kill tens of thousands of us - Islander and Merman alike. This new C/P, Raja Flattery, calls himself \"the Director,\" but he will see. We have kissed the ring and bared the throat for the last time.\\n\\n - First Shadowbox broadcast, 5 Bunratti 493\\n\\n First light through the single plasma-glass pane stroked a plain white pillow with its rosy fingers. It outlined the sparse but colorful furnishings of this cubby in shades of gray. The cubby itself, though squarely on land and squarely gridded to a continent, reflected traditions of a culture freely afloat for nearly five centuries on Pandora\u0027s seas.\\n\\n These Islanders, the biowizards of Pandora, grew everything. They grew their cups and bowls, the famous chairdogs, insulation, bondable organics, rugs, shelves and the islands themselves. This cubby was organically furnished, and under the old law warranted a heft of supply chits that converted easily to food coupons. Black-market coupons were a cheap enough price for the Director to pay to assimilate the Islander culture that had been dashed to the rocks the day he splashed down on the sea.\\n\\n As the grip of dawn strengthened into morning it further brightened the single wall-hanging of clasped hands that enriched this small cubby. Red and blue fishes swam the border, their delicate fins interlacing broad green leaves of kelp. Orange fin and blue leaf joined at the foot of the hanging to form a stylized Oracle. The tight stitch of the pattern and its crisp colors all rippled with the progress of dawn. A sleeper\u0027s chest rose and fell gently on the bed beneath them.\\n\\n The night and its shadows shrank back from the plasma-glass window at the head of the bed. Islanders had always enjoyed the light and in building their islands they let it in wherever they could. They persisted in light, even though most of them were now solidly marooned on land. In their undersea dwellings Mermen put pictures on their walls of the things they wall out - Islanders preferred the light, the breezes, the smells of life and the living. This cubby was small and spare, but light.\\n\\n This was a legal cubby, regularly inspected, a part of the shopkeeper\u0027s quarters. It was a second-floor street room above the new Ace of Cups coffee shop at Kalaloch harbor. A huge white coffee cup swung from a steel rod beneath the window.\\n\\n Almost synchronous with the sleeper\u0027s breathing came the slup slup of waves against the bulkhead below. Respirations caught, then resumed at the occasional splashings of a waking squawk and the wind-chime effect of sail riggings that clapped against a host of masts.\\n\\n Dawn brightened the room enough to reveal a seated figure beside the bed. The posture was one of alert stillness. This stillness was broken by an occasional move of cup to mouth, then back to the knee. The figure sat, back to the wall, beside the plaz and facing the hatch. First light glinted from a shining, intricately inlaid Islander cup of hardwood and mother-of-pearl. The hand that held the cup was male, neither delicate nor calloused.\\n\\n The figure leaned forward once, noting the depth of the sleeper\u0027s odd, open-eyed slumber. The progress of light across the bay outside their room was reflected in the hardening of shadows inside, and their relentless crawl.\\n\\n The watcher, Ben Ozette, pulled the cover higher over the sleeper\u0027s bare shoulder to ward off morning dampness. The pupils in her green irises stayed wide with the onset of dawn. He closed her eyes for her with his thumb. She didn\u0027t seem to mind. The shudder that passed over him uncontrollably was not due to the morning chill.\\n\\n She was a picture of white - white hair, eyelashes, eyebrows and a very fair porcelain skin. Her shaggy white hair was cropped around her face, falling nearly to her shoulders in the back. It was a perfect frame to those green, bright eyes. His hand strayed to the pillow, then back.\\n\\n His profile in the light revealed the high cheekbones, aquiline nose and high eyebrows of his Merman ancestry. In his years as a reporter for Holovision, Ben Ozette had become famous, his face as familiar planetwide as that of a brother or a husband. Listeners worldwide recognized his voice immediately. On their Shadowbox broadcasts, however, he became writer and cameramaster and Rico got out in the lights - in disguise, of course. Now their family, friends, coworkers would feel the snap of Flattery\u0027s wrath.\\n\\n They hadn\u0027t exactly had time to plan. During their weekly interviews, they both noticed how everyone, including compound security, stayed well out of microphone range as they taped. The next time they walked the grounds as they taped, interviewing with gusto. Then last night they simply walked out. Rico did the rest. The prospect of being hunted by Flattery\u0027s goons dried Ben\u0027s mouth a little. He sipped a little more water.\\n\\n Maybe it\u0027s true, maybe she\u0027s a construction, he thought. She\u0027s too perfectly beautiful to be an accident.\\n\\n If the Director\u0027s memos were right, she was a construction, something grown by the kelp, not someone born of a human. When dredged up at sea she was judged by the examining physician to be \"a green-eyed albino female, about twenty, in respiratory distress secondary to ingestion of sea water; agitated, recent memory excellent, remote memory judged to be poor, possibly absent...\"\\n\\n It had been five years since she washed out of the sea and into the news, and in that five years Flattery had allowed no one but his lab people near her. Ben has asked to do the story out of curiosity, and wound up pursuing more than he\u0027d bargained for. He\u0027d learned to hate the Director, and as he watched Crista\u0027s fitful sleep, he wasn\u0027t the least bit sorry.\\n\\n He had to admit that, yes, he knew from the first that it had always been a matter of time. He\u0027d fought Flattery and Holovision too openly and too long.\\n\\n A recent Shadowbox accused Holovision of being a monopoly of misinformation, Flattery\u0027s propaganda agent that would not regain credibility until it became worker-owned. Ben had leveled the same attack at the production assistant the previous day.\\n\\n Ben found himself being preempted by propagandistic little specials that Flattery\u0027s technicians were grinding out. Ben and Rico had bought or built their own cameras and laserbases to minimize the company\u0027s intimidation and Flattery\u0027s interference. Now they had full-time, nonpaying jobs as air pirates with Shadowbox.\\n\\n And fugitives, he thought.\\n\\n Ben Ozette eased back into the old chairdog and let the sleeper lie. Of all the deadliness on Pandora, this sleeper could be the most deadly. It was rumored that people had died at her touch, and this was not just the Director\u0027s professional rumor mill. Ben had dared touch her, and he was not yet one of the dead. It was rumored she was very, very bright.\\n\\n He whispered her name under his breath.\\n\\n Crista Galli.\\n\\n Her breathing skipped, she sniffed once, twice and settled down.\\n\\n Crista Galli had green eyes. Even now they opened ever so slightly, turning toward the sun, visible but not waking.\\n\\n Eerie.\\n\\n Ben\u0027s last love, his longest love, had brown eyes. She had also been his only love, practically speaking. That was Beatriz. Her coffee-colored eyes became vivid to him now against the shadows. Yes, Beatriz. They were still good friends, and she would take this hard. Ben\u0027s heart jumped a beat whenever their wakes crossed, and they crossed often at Holovision.\\n\\n Beatriz took on her series about Flattery\u0027s space program, she was away for weeks at a time. Ben freelanced docudramas on earthquake survivors, Islander relocation camps and an in-depth series on the kelp. His latest project featured Crista Galli and her life since her rescue in the kelp.\\n\\n Flattery agreed to the series and Ben agreed to confine the material to her rescue and subsequent rehabilitation. This project led him into Raja Flattery\u0027s most sacred closets, and further away from Beatriz. The Holovision rumor mill claimed that she and the Orbiter Commander, Dwarf MacIntosh, were seeing each other lately. Through his own choice Ben and Beatriz had been separated for nearly a year. He knew she\u0027d find someone else eventually. Now that it was real he decided he\u0027d better get used to it.\\n\\n Beatriz Tatoosh was the most stunning correspondent on Holovision, and one of the toughest. Like Ben, she did field work for Holovision Nightly News. She also hosted a weekly feature on the Director\u0027s \"Project Voidship,\" a project of great religious and economic controversy. Beatriz championed the project, Ben remained a vocal opponent. He was glad he\u0027d kept her away from the Shadowbox plan. At least she didn\u0027t have to be on the run.\\n\\n Those dark eyes of her...\\n\\n Ben snapped himself alert and shook off the vision of Beatriz. Her wide eyes and broad smile dissolved in the sunrise.\\n\\n The woman who slept, Crista Galli, put quite a stutter into his heartbeat the first time he saw her. Though she was young, she had more encyclopedic knowledge than anyone he\u0027d ever met. Facts were her thing. About her own life, her nearly twenty years down under, she apparently knew very little. Ben\u0027s agreement with Flattery prohibited much probing of this while they were inside the Preserve.\\n\\n She had dreams of value and so he let her dream. He would ask about them when she woke, keep them with his notes, and the two of them would make a plan.\\n\\n This, he realized, was something of a dream in itself. There was already a plan, and he would follow the rest of it as soon as he was told what it was.\\n\\n Today for the first time she would see what the people had made of the myth that was Crista Galli, the holy being that had been kept away from them for so long. She could not know, closed away from humans as she\u0027d been for all of her twenty-four years, what it meant that she had become the people\u0027s god. He hoped that, when the crunch came, she would be a merciful god.\\n\\n Someone entered the building below and Ben tensed, setting his cup aside. He patted his jacket pocket where the weight of his familiar recorder had been replaced by Rico\u0027s old lasgun. There was the rush of water and the chatter of a grinder downstairs. A rich coffee fragrance wafted up to him, set his stomach growling. He sipped more water from the cup and half-relaxed.\\n\\n Ben felt his memories pale with the light, but the light did not still his unease. Things were out of control in the world, that had made him uneasy for years. He had a chance to change the world, and he wasn\u0027t letting go of it.\\n\\n Flattery\u0027s totalitarian fist was something that Beatriz had refused to see. Her dreams lay out among the stars and she would believe almost anything if it would take her there. Ben\u0027s dreams lay at his feet. He believed that Pandorans could make this the best of all worlds, once the Director moved aside. Now that things were out of control in his personal life it made him, for the first time, a little bit afraid.\\n\\n Ben was glad for the light. He reminisced in the dark but he always felt he thought best in the light. The fortune, the future of millions of lives lay sleeping in this cubby. Crista could be either the savior of humanity or its destroying angel.\\n\\n Or neither.\\n\\n Shadowbox would do its best to give her the chance at savior. Ben and Crista Galli stood at the vortex of the two conflicts dividing Pandora: Flattery\u0027s handhold on their throats, and the Avata/Human standoff that kept it there.\\n\\n Crista Galli had been born in Avata, the kelp. She represented a true Avata/Human mix, reputed to be the sole survivor of a long line of poets, prophets and genetic tinkering.\\n\\n She had been educated by the kelp\u0027s store of genetic memories, human and otherwise. She knew without being taught. She\u0027d heard echoes of the best and the worst of humanity fed to her mind for nearly twenty years. There were some other echoes, too.\\n\\n The Others, the thoughts of Avata itself, those were the echoes that the Director feared.\\n\\n \"The kelp\u0027s sent her to spy on us,\" Flattery was heard to have said early on. \"No telling what it\u0027s done to her subconscious.\"\\n\\n Crista Galli was one of the great mysteries of genetics. The faithful claimed she was a miracle made flesh.\\n\\n \"I did it myself,\" she told him during their first interview, \"as we all do.\"\\n\\n Or, as she put it in their last interview: \"I made good selections from the DNA buffet.\"\\n\\n Flattery\u0027s fear had kept Crista under what he called \"protective custody\" for the past five years while the people clamored worldwide for a glimpse. The Director\u0027s Vashon Security Force provided the protection. It was the Vashon Security Force that hunted them now.\\n\\n She could be a monster, Ben thought. Some kind of time bomb set by Avata to go of... when? Why?\\n\\n The great body of kelp that some called \"Avata\" directed the flow of all currents and, therefore, all shipping planetwide. It calmed the ravages of Pandora\u0027s two-sun system, making land and the planet itself possible. Ben, and many others, believed that Avata had a mind of its own.\\n\\n Crista Galli stirred, tucked herself further under the quilt and resumed her even breathing. Ben knew that killing her now while she slept might possibly save the world and himself. He had heard that argument among the rabid right, among those accustomed to working with Flattery.\\n\\n Possibly.\\n\\n But Ozette believed now that she could save the world for Avata and human alike, and for this he vowed to guard her every breath - for this, and for the stirrings of love that strained in old traces.\\n\\n Spider Nevi and his thugs hunted the both of them now. Ben had wooed her away from the Director\u0027s very short leash, but Crista did the rest. Crista and Rico. Ben knew well that the leash would become a lash, a noose for himself and possibly for her next time and he had better see to it that there was no next time. Flattery had made it clear that there was nothing in the world more deadly, more valuable than Crista Galli. It was certain the man who\u0027d made off with her wouldn\u0027t be lightly spared.\\n\\n Ben was forty now. At fifteen he\u0027d been plunged into war with the sinking of Guemes Island. Many thousands died that day, brutally slashed, burned, drowned at the attack of a huge Merman submersible, a kelp-trimmer that burst through the center of the old man-made island, lacerating everything in its path. Ben had been rimside when the sudden lurch and collapse sent him tumbling into the pink-frothed sea.\\n\\n The years since and the horrors he had seen gave him a wisdom of sorts, an instinct for trouble and the escape hatch. This wisdom was only wisdom as long as he kept alive, and he remembered how easily he had thrown instinct out the porthole the time he fell in love with Beatriz. He had not thought that could happen again until the day he met Crista Galli, a meeting that had been half-motivated at the possibility of seeing Beatriz somewhere inside Flattery\u0027s compound. Crista had whispered, \"Help me,\" that day, and while swimming in her green-eyed gaze he\u0027d said, simply, \"Yes.\"\\n\\n In her head sleeps the Great Wisdom, he thought. If she can unlock it without destroying herself, she can help us all.\\n\\n Even if it wasn\u0027t true, Ben knew that Flattery thought it was true, and that was good enough.\\n\\n She rolled over, still asleep, and turned her face up at the prospect of the dim light.\\n\\n Keep you away from light, they say, he thought. Keep you away from kelp, keep you away from the sea. Don\u0027t touch you. In his back pocket he carried the precautionary instructions in case he accidentally touched her bare skin.\\n\\n And what would Operations think if they knew I\u0027d kissed her?\\n\\n He chuckled, and marveled at the power beside him in that room.\\n\\n The Director had already seen to it that no interview of Crista Galli would ever be aired. Now, at Flattery\u0027s direction, Holovision had lured Beatriz with an extra hour of air time a week glorifying Flattery\u0027s \"Project Voidship.\"\\n\\n Beatriz is running blind, he thought. She loves the idea of exploring the void so much that she\u0027s ignored the price that Flattery\u0027s exacting.\\n\\n Flattery\u0027s fear of Crista\u0027s relationship with the kelp had kept her under guard. The Director sequestered her \"for her own protection, for study, for the safety of all humankind.\" Despite weekly access to Flattery\u0027s private compound, Beatriz showed no interest in Crista Galli. She lobbied his support, however, when Ben had requested the interviews.\\n\\n Maybe she hoped to see more of me, too.\\n\\n Beatriz was wedded to her career, just as Ben was, and something as nebulous as a career made pretty intangible competition. Ben couldn\u0027t understand how Beatriz let the Crista Galli story slip through her fingers. Today he was very happy that she had.\\n\\n Fire smolders in a soul more surely than it does under ashes.\\n\\n - Gaston Bachelard, The Psychoanalysis of Fire\\n\\n Kalan woke up from his nestling spot between his mother\u0027s large breasts to loud curses and a scuffle a few meters down The Line. The chime overhead tolled five, the same as his fingers, same as his years. He did not look in the direction of the scuffle because his mother told him it was bad luck to look at people having bad luck. A pair of line patrolmen appeared with their clubs. There were the thudding noises again and the morning quieted down.\\n\\n He and his warm mother stayed wrapped in her drape, the same one that had shaded them the day before. This morning, at the chime of five, they had been in The Line for seventeen hours. His mother warned him how long it would be. At noon the previous day Kalan had looked forward to seeing the inside of the food place but after everything he\u0027d seen in The Line he just wanted to go home.\\n\\n They had slept the last few hours at the very gates of the food place. Now he heard footsteps behind the gates, the metallic unclick of locks.\\n\\n His mother brushed off their clothes and gathered all of their containers. He already wore the pack she\u0027d made him, he hadn\u0027t taken it off since they turned in their scrap. Kalan wanted to be ready when she negotiated rice, because carrying the rice back home was his job. They had made it right up to the warehouse door at midnight, then had it locked in their faces. His mother helped him read the sign at the door: \"Closed for cleaning and restocking 12-5.\" He wanted to start his job carrying the rice now so he could be going home.\\n\\n \"Not yet.\" His mother tugged his shirttail to restrain him. \"They\u0027re not ready. They\u0027d just beat us back.\"\\n\\n An older woman behind Kalan clucked her tongue and collected a breath on an inward hiss.\\n\\n \"Look there,\" she whispered, and lifted a bony finger to point at the figure of a man trotting down the street. He looked backward toward the docks more than forward, so he stumbled a lot, and he ran with his hands over his ears. As he ran by he crouched, wild-eyed, as though everyone in The Line would eat him. As two of the security moved to cross the street, the short young man skittered away down the street uttering frightened, out-of-breath cries that Kalan didn\u0027t understand.\\n\\n \"Driftninny,\" the old woman said. \"One of those family islands must\u0027ve grounded. It\u0027s hardest for them.\" She raised her reedy voice to lecture pitch: \"The unfathomable wrath of Ship will strike the infidel Flatter...\"\\n\\n \"Shaddup!\" a security barked, and she muttered herself to silence.\\n\\n Then there arose in The Line a grumbled discussion of the difficulties of adjustment, the same kind of talk that Kalan had heard muttered around the home fire when they first settled here from the sea. He didn\u0027t remember the sea at all, but his mother told him stories about how beautiful their little island was, and she named all the generations that had drifted their island before Kalan was born.\\n\\n The Line woke up and stretched and passed the word back in a serpentine ripple: \"Keys up.\" \"Hey, keys are up!\" \"Keys, sister. Keys up.\"\\n\\n His mother stood, and leaned against the wall to balance herself as she strapped on her pack.\\n\\n \"Hey, sister!\"\\n\\n A scar-faced security reached between Kalan and his mother and tapped the side of her leg with his stick.\\n\\n \"Off the warehouse. C\u0027mon, you know bette...\"\\n\\n She stepped right up to his nose as she shouldered her carryall, but she didn\u0027t speak. He did not back down. Kalan had never seen anyone who didn\u0027t back down to his mother.\\n\\n \"First tickets up, alphabetical order, left to right,\" he said. This time he tapped his stick against her bottom. \"Get moving.\"\\n\\n Then they were inside a press of bodies and through the gates, into a long narrow room. Where Kalan had expected to see the food place, he saw instead a wall with a line of stalls. An attendant and a security armed with stunstick flanked each stall, and out of each one jutted what he thought must be the nose or tongue of some great demon.\\n\\n His mother hurried him and their things to the furthest stall.\\n\\n \"Those are conveyer belts,\" she explained. \"They go way back into the building and bring out our order to us and they drop it here.
