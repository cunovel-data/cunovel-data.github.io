{"id":98986,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"Me? Wha... ?\" \"That show they did when you first installed this station,\" Spud said. \"They reran it. Your hair wasn\u0027t as gray two years ago. I wish that Beatriz Tatoosh would look at me the way she looked at you.\" \"Stow it!\" MacIntosh said. Soleus\u0027s shoulders sagged slightly, but he kept at his keyboard in silence. \"Sorry,\" MacIntosh said. \"Inappropriate,\" Spud replied. \"Want me to take it now?\" \"I wish somebody would. What the hell\u0027s happening to our kelp?\" \"It\u0027s not our kelp,\" MacIntosh reminded him. \"The kelp is its ow... self. We\u0027re keeping it in chains. It\u0027s doing what any enslaved being with dignity does - it\u0027s fighting the chains.\" \"But Flattery\u0027s men will just prune it back, or worse yet they\u0027ll stump the whole stand.\" \"Not forever. There is a basic problem with slavery. The master is enslaved by the slave.\" \"C\u0027mon, Dr. Mac...\" MacIntosh laughed. \"It\u0027s true,\" he said. \"Look at history, that\u0027s easy enough. And Flattery, of all people, should know better. We clones were the slaves of our age. First-generation clones had it real tough. They were grown as organ farms for the donors. They needed us, but they needed us to do what we were told. Now he\u0027s enslaved the kelp, stunted its reason, because he needs it to do what it\u0027s told. He can\u0027t keep cutting it back, because he can\u0027t afford the regrowth time.\" \"So, what\u0027ll happen?\" \"A showdown,\" MacIntosh said. \"And if Flattery\u0027s still groundside when it comes he\u0027d better hope that the kelp needs him for something or I wouldn\u0027t give you two bits for his chances.\" \"Two bits of what?\" MacIntosh laughed again, a big bark of a laugh to match his size. \"I wouldn\u0027t want to guess how old that expression is,\" he said. \"When I was at Moonbase, two bits was a quarter, which was a quarter of a dollar, which was the currency we used. But it started way before that.\" \"We\u0027d say, \u0027I wouldn\u0027t give a dasher turd for his chances.\u0027\" \"That\u0027s probably a better assessment.\" MacIntosh pointed at the six red lights blinking on their messenger console. \"Whose calls are we not taking?\" \"The Director,\" Spud said, and swiveled his chair from the console board. \"He wants us to do something about the kelp in sector eight, as though we weren\u0027t trying.\" \"Do somethin... hah! If we push any harder we\u0027ll fry our board, and that kelp, and anybody inside it.\" \"I wonder what it is that the kelp wants?\" \"What if we gave it its head?\" MacIntosh mused. \"That would be one way to find out. What could it do that it hasn\u0027t already done?\" Spud shrugged, and said, \"You\u0027ve got my vote. How you going to convince the Director?\" A glance at the display showed the entire stand of kelp to be twisting itself into a vortex, like the whirlpool in a drain. As near as MacIntosh could tell, Current Control was at its maximum limit of restraint. Spud pointed at the display. \"There\u0027s a focus of electrical override here. Whatever\u0027s bugging the kelp is right there.\" \"Electrical or mechanical?\" \"Could be either, or both - it\u0027s a heavy traffic area,\" Spud said. \"Something down there is definitely irritating the kelp.\" \"Yes,\" MacIntosh agreed, \"that\u0027s my thought. The electrical override is coming from the kelp itself. It must be responding to something. That stand\u0027s not mature enough to think for itself. Or, at least, it shouldn\u0027t be.\" \"Doc?\" \"Yeah?\" MacIntosh watched the console review the kelp\u0027s configuration changes over the past half-hour. Something nagged at him, something that would explain the kelp\u0027s sudde... behavior. \"I\u0027ve extrapolated the path of the override.\" MacIntosh looked at Spud, who was busy at his own console, and saw a very thin, very pale assistant. Spud\u0027s pointing finger trembled with excitement. \"What is it?\" \"It\u0027s a spiral, headed into the middle of sector eight.\" \"That means the one kelp bed is delivering something to its neighbor - isn\u0027t that what it looks like to you?\" \"Or the neighbor is snatching it away.\" \"Spud, I\u0027ll bet you\u0027re right.\" MacIntosh stepped up to the console and tapped out a sequence with his two huge index fingers. The red lights on the messenger panel went black. \"We just had a relay malfunction,\" MacIntosh said, and winked at Spud. \"Next time Flattery calls, tell him it was a hardwire failure and you worked it out personally. Maybe you\u0027ll get a promotion. If I\u0027ve guessed wrong, my job will be up for grabs. Now, we might as well let go the reins on this kelp and see where the hell it runs.\" MacIntosh heard Spud swallow behind him and he smiled. \"What\u0027s the big deal, Spud? It\u0027s a plant, it\u0027s not going anywhere.\" \"Wel... well, it\u0027s just that Flattery doesn\u0027t trust anybody - it\u0027d be like him to have some kind of booby-tra...\" \"He did,\" MacIntosh said, \"and this stand got itself blown apart a few years back. But he hasn\u0027t reset charges here yet - the kelp\u0027s not supposed to get this frisky this soon.\" He waited for the burst line to charge. \"There!\" he said, and pressed the send signal. \"Now let\u0027s sit back and see what cooks. Something bizarre is inside there, and I\u0027d like to be the first to know what it is. If we can\u0027t do anything with this stand, maybe we can at least learn from it. Besides,\" he winked again, \"Flattery\u0027s down there, we\u0027re not.\" A beeping signal from his console interrupted him. He opened the intercom to Launch Command. \"We sling our bird your way in five minutes,\" the voice said. \"Any contraindications?\" \"Negative,\" MacIntosh replied. \"Currents at your site are stable, weather will arrive your location in approximately one hour.\" \"Roger that, Current Control. Launch is a go fo... four minutes.\" Canon in D - Pachelbel The Immensity recoiled with a snap from the shock of freedom, then let its tendrils and fronds drift in their tingling bliss. It had been a long time since this union of stands had felt good, and never had it felt this good. The submarine trains foundering among its vines were inconsequential now. A pulse went out among the fronds, a ripple throughout the Immensity from the tiny foil adrift at its outer reaches. A mass of tentacles cradled the foil and delighted in the scent of self that it gave from its brittle skin. The little craft was slippery and the Immensity knew it to be extremely fragile, so it was gently tumbled frond to frond inward. Other scents mingled with that of the One. One of these scents was familiar, provocative, kelplike. The Holomaster, Rico LaPush, was in the company of someone that the kelp had encountered befor... befor... well, no matter. It would find out soon enough. The Immensity had learned to sniff out the holo language of humans from their spectrum of odd scents. It decided, early upon awakening this time, that it would have to speak with humans to live. It also concluded that it would have to speak the holo language if it wanted to speak with humans. The foil tried to wriggle out of the kelp\u0027s net. There was much pain now through the vines, where all of the trains trapped in sector eight were trying to burn, cut, slash their way toward their precious atmosphere topside. Some of these the kelp crushed reflexively, but when the death scents of the crews mingled with the sea it forced itself to calm and to reason. Death, it reminded itself, is not the answer to life. The Immensity managed to open several kelpways and marveled at the easy ballet of subs heading topside. Only the bright white Holovision foil suffered the grip of the Immensity. It strained its engines trying to flee, but never lashed out at its tormentor. This the Immensity would expect of the One, who was civilized in the arms of kelp, and of the honorable associates of Holomaster Rico LaPush. In conscience you find the structure, the form of consciousness, the beauty. - Kerro Panille, \"Translations from the Avata,\" The Histories Beatriz listened to the launch crew director count down the final minute over the speaker. Her shaky fingers chattered the metal clips as she snugged up her harness. She tried to think of the straps around her as Mack\u0027s arms and she tried to imagine they held her as Ben\u0027s did the night they drove old Vashon down. It didn\u0027t work. Nothing could erase the sight of her crew, slaughtered like sebet in a pen. For a mistake, she thought. They all died because that bastard made a mistake. She knew that the captain was afraid, she could smell it on him before he gave the final order at the studio. He obviously didn\u0027t know whether Flattery would promote him or execute him for his decision. Beatriz knew that her life, perhaps many other lives, teetered in this balance. \"Ten seconds to launch.\" She inhaled a long, slow breath through her mouth and let it sigh out her nostrils. This was a relaxation technique that Rico had taught her when they all nearly drowned five years ago. \"Five, fou...\" She took a little breath. ... on...\" The compressed-air \"boot\" punched them up the launch tube and a pair of Atkinson Rams slung them toward orbit. This was the part of the ride she hated - it reminded her of the time the fat girl sat on her chest when she was just starting school, and she didn\u0027t like the feel of her face flattening out against the strain. On this launch, however, she wasn\u0027t worried about wrinkles, engine failure, being trapped in orbit. She was worried about the captain, and how she could help convince him of the necessity of keeping her alive. No one in the shuttle cabin looked familiar. Most of them had changed out of their fatigues and into civilian clothes. They were quiet; Beatriz thought that they must be weighing the consequences of the shootings. She didn\u0027t see the man who started it. That was the man she feared even more than the captain - Ben had always said that the jumpy ones get you killed. How could he be so right and be so far away from me? She rubbed her tired face and patted her cheeks to keep hysteria at bay. She needed information, and a lot of it. Mack, she thought. He\u0027ll help me, I\u0027m sure. For an instant her fear included him. After all, he was an original crew member like Flattery. They had worked together long before waking from hybernation on Pandora. What i... what i... ? She shook off her fears. If her imagination had to run away with her, she preferred that it ally her with Mack instead of against him. Mack was not at all like Flattery, this she knew. Even Mack had cringed at the news when Flattery converted Alyssa Marsh to an Organic Mental Core. \"I never believed we needed such a thing,\" he\u0027d told her privately. \"Now, with the kelp research, I\u0027m even more convinced that OMCs were just another built-in frustration, a goad to push us even further from humanity.\" According to reports - Flattery\u0027s reports - Marsh had been found in extremis after an accident in the kelp. He explained to her how clones were property, often merely living stores for spare parts, and how Alyssa Marsh had been prepared for this moment from her girlhood. Now Beatriz realized how fortuitous the timing had been for Flattery, how unfortunate for Marsh and her kelp studies with Dwarf MacIntosh. What will Mack do? He would need information, too. Like, how many in this squad? What kinds of weapons? Do they have a plan or is this just reaction to the killings groundside? She couldn\u0027t remember how many people worked the orbiter station - two thousand? Three? And how much security did they have aloft? Not much, she remembered. Just a handful to handle fights and petty theft among the workers. She\u0027d counted thirty-two in the captain\u0027s squad as they boarded the shuttle, and each was heavily armed. Eight of them were assigned to fill out her crew, and they grumbled under the double load. This bunch carried a lot of the old, disfiguring mutations. The gear they\u0027d loaded aboard was mostly weapons, but a few of them knew enough about holo broadcast to bring the bare bones of what they\u0027d need to get Newsbreak on the air. A couple of techs were assigned to oversee the OMC. Beatriz had kept the worst of the shakes at bay and now, strapped firmly into her couch, she nearly let herself go. No, she warned herself, hold tight. I can\u0027t help anyone dead. I am the only witness against them. She hoped that the console tape survived back there, and that someone sympathetic would find it. Who would they show it to that could do anything? she wondered. Flattery? Beatriz grunted a laugh at herself, then felt the captain\u0027s grip on her shoulder. It was firm, not painful. It was not gentle. It reminded her of her father\u0027s grip the night he died, and it lightened the same when their engines shut down. This man was the same age as her youngest brother, but there was infinity in his dark eyes. She didn\u0027t see much wisdom. \"I know what you\u0027re thinking,\" he said. \"I have taken hundreds of prisoners, I have been a prisoner. Believe me, I know what you\u0027re thinking.\" He gestured the guard beside her away and, surprisingly clumsy in zero-gee, moved up to join her. His voice sounded gravelly, strained, as though it had been screaming. He continued speaking, while his men drifted out of earshot, their glances furtive and their conversations spare. \"We are both in a bad spot, you and I. We both need out of it.\" She had to agree. \"Up here it will be all or nothing, we are trapped. There is no escape for either one of us that doesn\u0027t require both of us.\" To this, too, she had to agree. But only for the moment, she assured herself, only until I find Mack. Beatriz realized that, much as it disgusted her, her life depended on communicating with this man. \"You are a military man, an officer. How is it that you walk yourself out the plank like this? You wouldn\u0027t have done it on reflex. This is a plan and w... I simply fall into i...\" \"My God, you\u0027re perceptive,\" the words came in a rush, the captain\u0027s eyes aglitter. \"We can only win, Flattery is finished. We have the Voidship and Orbiter - enough food stores for years. We control their currents and weather. We have Flattery\u0027s precious Organic Mental Core - shit, we can hook it up to the ship ourselves and fly out of her...\" She didn\u0027t hear the rest. Her mind focused on what he\u0027d said at the beginning: \"enough food stores for years.\" If he kills everyone aboard the Orbiter. ... He\u0027ll have to throw it in,\" the captain was saying. \"The rabble will have at him down there, and he doesn\u0027t dare destroy everything that he\u0027s worked for up here. Whoever beats him on the ground then can deal with me.\" He\u0027s really going to do this, she thought. He\u0027s going to kill everyone aboard. He took her hand and she snapped it back with a revulsion that she couldn\u0027t hide. \"Us,\" he said. \"I meant they can deal with us. You and me. They\u0027ll believe whatever you tell them, at least for a while.\" He leaned closer, whispered, \"You don\u0027t want to make another mistake, get more people killed.\" She propelled herself out of her couch, not caring where the thrust might throw her in the gravity-free cabin. No one pursued her. The first handhold she grabbed stopped her beside a pair of security, younger than the young captain, who were reviewing the basics of holo camera triangulation. They really intend to go on the air, she thought. She looked back at the captain. He had his back to her, briefing several men. The tone of his voice, briskness of his gestures told her that he meant business. It was true, he could do it without her. It was true, that by helping him she might save others. She could not bring herself to speak to him, to go to him in any way. She sighed, and interrupted her two new cameramen. \"No,\" she said, \"with that setup the alpha set only gets fifteen degrees of pan. OK if you\u0027re covering a launch, but we\u0027ll be inside, in a small spac...\" As she instructed the two young amateurs she saw Brood watching her. He winked at her once, and she successfully suppressed the shudder that tempted her spine. \"They\u0027ll want to see this Organic Mental Core in transport, and they\u0027ll want to know something about its - her - background. Let\u0027s start by getting some of that in the can.\" She passed the two-hour flight instructing her camera operators, two men and a woman, none of whom she recognized from the massacre at the SLS studio. Beatriz preferred their company, even if they did answer to the captain. Whether by accident or design, she did not encounter any of that squad during their flight. The Organic Mental Core was a living brain, enclosed in an intricate plasma-glass container that made allowances for the hookups to come. A complex plug would connect the brain with the control system aboard the Voidship. What she didn\u0027t expect horrified her the most. They\u0027re supported b... bodies! She had done a report on such a thing several years ago. Scientists had connected a brain from a crushed body to a healthy body that had suffered a massive head injury. Each kept the other alive, though there had been no way to communicate with the healthy brain. At that time it was simply trapped in there, cut off from all sensation, alive and dreaming. She took a deep breath and let the reporter in her take over. The medtech in charge had a number of active facial tics and each of her questions seemed to accelerate them. She learned nothing about the principle that she hadn\u0027t already learned through research or through Dwarf MacIntosh. \"...s you well know, it was because of a failure in the OMCs that we wound up on Pandora.\" \"I understand that the OMCs were traditionally taken from infants with fatal birth defects. This OMC is from an adult human. How will the performance differ?\" \"Twofold,\" the tech replied. \"First, this person was dying at the time of conversion, therefore it - she - should be thankful for an extension of her life in a useful, indeed noble, role. Second, this person survived the longest hybernation known to humankind and woke to life on Pandora. She knows that if humans are to survive, it must be elsewhere. She can take comfort in being the instrument of that survival.\" \"Does she know any of this?\" The tech looked perplexed. \"Much of this was included in her early training. The rest we extrapolate from the evidence.\" \"What was she like as a person?\" \"What do you mean?\" The tech\u0027s tics accelerated rapidly to a very distracting crescendo.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ascension-factor-destination-void-4/page-11.html","bookId":2172,"book":{"id":2172,"title":"The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4)","description":"Storyline: The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4) As one of three survivours of the orbiting hibernation tanks, a Raja Flattery clone has established himself as \"Director\" of Pandora.
