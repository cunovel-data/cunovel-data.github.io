{"id":98980,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"Yeah, and he\u0027s up in Victoria,\" Dana said. \"They think different up there. You know they split them up so if they shoot somebody it won\u0027t be family.\"\n \"That\u0027s not true!\" Flutterby said. \"They just don\u0027t want them working the same district as their family because - because -\"\n \"They\u0027re going to walk in here if we don\u0027t get busy,\" Jaka interrupted. His voice was changing, and he tried to make it sound authoritative. Jaka lived at the edge of Kalaloch\u0027s largest refugee camp. He was more fearful than the others of the immediacy of hunger and the reprisals of security. At twelve, he had already seen enough death from both. He uncased his well-worn flute and snapped the sections together.\n Dana shrugged, sighed and uncased her caracol. Its new strings glistened in a stray sliver of sunlight. The swirled black back of its huge shell shone with the polish of four generations of fingers.\n \"Give me an A,\" she said.\n Jaka obliged, and as they proceeded to tune the caracol the other two youngsters tore the cloth into four equal lengths of about three meters each.\n \"Has your brother ever killed anybody?\" Leet whispered.\n \"Of course not,\" Flutterby said. She smoothed out the wrinkles in their cloth without meeting the other girl\u0027s eyes.\n \"He\u0027s not like that. You\u0027ve met him.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Leet said. Her brown eyes brightened and she giggled.\n \"He\u0027s so cute.\"\n Flutterby found that she got her banner lettered with less than half a tube of green. It was dark green and would be nearly as visible as black. The large block letters read, \"WE\u0027RE HUNGRY NOW!\" It had become the rallying cry of the refugees, but she\u0027d heard it mumbled everywhere lately. As scarcity spread and rations declined, Flutterby had even heard it whispered in The Line.\n The Line, where everyone stood for hours to get into the food distribution centers, was where she chose to hang her banner. Leet\u0027s would go over their school, which faced the concrete-and-plasteel offices of Merman Mercantile. Jaka wanted to smuggle his into Merman Hyperconductor, and Dana said she\u0027d hang hers from the ferry dock, within easy view of Holovision\u0027s offices on the pier.\n Dana ran up and down the scales a few times, then she and Jaka played a fast, lilting dance piece they\u0027d practiced at school. Flutterby thought it the best her friend had ever played. Jaka struggled, as usual, but diligently played on.\n \"Do you think the Shadows kidnapped Crista Galli?\" Leet asked.\n The bulky tube was difficult for her to handle, and she was going over her letters twice to make them bold enough to be read at a distance.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Flutterby said. \"I don\u0027t know what to believe anymore. My mother grew up on Vashon, and she says that Crista Galli is some kind of god or something. My dad says she\u0027s just another freak.\"\n \"Your mother?\"\n \"No,\" Flutterby giggled, \"Crista Galli, you stoop. He says that the only way to feed the world is to keep control of the currents, and that if Crista Galli helps control the kelp then the Director is right to make sure she doesn\u0027t get away, or turn it against us. What do your parents think?\"\n Leet frowned.\n \"They don\u0027t say much of anything, anymore,\" she said. \"They\u0027re both working all the time, every day. Mom says she\u0027s too tired to hear herself think. My dad won\u0027t even watch the news anymore. He doesn\u0027t say anything, just bites his lip and goes to bed. I think they\u0027re afrai...\"\n An explosion in the harbor startled them both. Dana set her caracol on the deck with a thump.\n \"That was close,\" she said. Dana had a lisp that came out when she was nervous, and it slipped out now.\n The four of them crowded the tiny plaz porthole at the far end of the attic. A smudge of black smoke blotted the sky to their right at the end of the street. Looking up the street to the left, Flutterby watched the giant cup on the Ace of Cups sign swing to and fro from the concussion. The street was packed with morning commuters and vendors at their little tables. Flutterby heard a gasp from Dana, and looked where she pointed, straight beneath them.\n \"Security!\" she whispered. \"He\u0027s covering the hatch. They must already be inside!\"\n \"We\u0027ve got to hide this stuff,\" Jaka said, his whisper cracking into its high range. \"If they find this, they\u0027ll kill us.\"\n \"Or worse,\" Dana muttered.\n They scrambled to gather up the paints and to roll up the two wet banners, but it was too late.\n The flimsy hatch burst aside as a fat, no-neck security kicked it in. Another, nearly identical to him, slipped inside and waited with his back to the wall.\n \"Look here,\" he said, straightening the banners with the muzzle of his weapon. \"A little nest of flatwings, no?\"\n Without waiting for a reply he snapped two bursts from his lasgun. Jaka and Leet dropped to the deck, dead.\n Flutterby wanted to scream, but she couldn\u0027t catch her breath.\n \"They\u0027re wots,\" his partner said. \"What did yo... ?\"\n \"Maggots make flies,\" the other said. \"We have orders.\" The muzzle came up again and Flutterby didn\u0027t even see the flash that killed her.\n Mankind owns four things\n that are no good at sea:\n rudder, anchor, oars\n and the fear of going down.\n - Antonio Machado\n Ben undogged the hatch and Rico LaPush rushed inside. Rico nodded once to the girl, who looked ghastly pale, and handed Ben the pocket messenger. Most of the briefing on it was already outdated, but Ben would want to hear it, anyway. Rico was careful to keep from touching the girl.\n \"Ready?\" he asked.\n \"Ready,\" Ben said.\n \"Yes,\" said the girl.\n Rico scratched his chin stubble and adjusted the lasgun in the back of his pants. He had been with Ben since Guemes island was sunk, more years than Crista Galli had been alive. His mistrust of people had kept them alive more than once, and he did not intend to let his guard down with Her Holiness.\n \"Deja vu,\" he said to Ben, nodding at her Islander dress. \"She reminds me of the old days, when things were simply tough. The streets are crawling with security, she\u0027ll need a good ac...\"\n \"You can speak to me,\" Crista interrupted, her cheeks flushed with a run of anger. \"I have ears to hear, mouth to answer. This sister is not a chairdog, nor a glass of water on her brother\u0027s table.\"\n Rico had to muster a smile. Her Islander accent was perfect, her phrasing perfect. She was a very quick study - of course, she had more intimate ways of getting inside people\u0027s head...\n \"Thank you for the lesson, sister,\" he said. \"You are most cheerfully dressed, my compliments.\"\n Rico noted Ben\u0027s smile, and the fact that his partner\u0027s gaze never wavered from Crista Galli\u0027s perfect face.\n Rico\u0027s cameras had taped the faces of many beautiful women for Holovision and he had to admit that everything he\u0027d heard about Crista Galli was true. When Ben became a reporter, Rico LaPush signed on as a field triangulator with the holography crew. A well-placed lie got him the job, but his facility for learning kept it. He had filmed more pomp and more horror in any given year than most cameramen witnessed in a lifetime.\n She\u0027s pale, but beautiful, he thought. Maybe the sun will give her some color.\n Operations said to keep her out of the sun, but Rico thought that, given their recent bad luck, this would be impossible. Operations, whoever they were, didn\u0027t have their butts on the line.\n \"We\u0027ll be walking for a while,\" Rico told them. \"Don\u0027t hurry.\"\n He nodded at the messenger in Ben\u0027s hand.\n \"Don\u0027t bother,\" he said. \"You might as well shitcan that thing. They tell us we\u0027re going by air but the airstrip\u0027s already locked up by Flattery\u0027s boys. We\u0027ll have to do it by water.\"\n \"But they sai...\"\n \"I know what they said,\" Rico snapped. \"They said the airstrip would be secure. They said keep her away from water. Let\u0027s move.\"\n Crista Galli carried a sadness about her that Rico didn\u0027t like. He could take fear, or anger, or even hysteria but sadness felt too much like bad luck. They\u0027d started out with that. When she reached out a tentative hand toward Ben, Rico stopped her with a word.\n \"No,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t let you touch him.\"\n \"Your fear?\" she shot back, \"or this \u0027Operations\u0027? He is clothed.\"\n \"My fear.\"\n She was hurt when Ben remained silent.\n Crista shrank back from him, and Rico slipped into the Guemes dialect that he\u0027d set aside years ago.\n \"Among Islanders, I am merely advising one of my sisters that she needs to recognize the depth of trust and love that the people have for her,\" he said, with a curt nod of his head. \"They speak out to her when the speaking is painful.\"\n \"And the fear?\"\n Good! Rico thought. She won\u0027t be bullied.\n He continued to speak to her in the manner of the Guemes Islanders.\n \"This sister apprises the brother well. Let the brother remind the sister that only the unknown is feared. Perhaps the sister will set this brother at ease, in time. Shall we begin?\"\n She was quiet then, and Rico liked that about her. Whatever curse she carried, she carried it with grace. He had known Ben Ozette for twenty-five years. Rico had fallen in love with a dozen women during that time, but Ben had only fallen once. Rico remembered that Ben had looked at Beatriz Tatoosh the same way he now looked at Crista Galli.\n It\u0027s about time, he thought, and smiled to himself. Beatriz is tight with that guy MacIntosh. Ben needs somebody solid, too.\n Everybody knew that relationships within the industry had to be short-lived, and that families were impossible. With all of the travel and stress something, somewhere, had to give and it was usually the relationship. Rico had given up long ago and was currently seeing a redhead who worked full-time for Operations.\n \"The harbor,\" Rico said as they started down the ramp. \"It\u0027s a madhouse there and so far no security near the Flying Fish. Victoria\u0027s as secure as Victoria gets, so we\u0027ll head up there. Risky, but not so risky as this.\"\n They turned right, walking slowly down the pier, toward the crowd at dockside. Rico trailed slightly behind the couple, keeping buildings and hatchways close, and didn\u0027t speak. He nearly stumbled into the Galli girl several times as she stopped suddenly to stare at some of the shops and the relics of herself that were sold there. At each shop, she pulled the mantilla closer about her face.\n So, it\u0027s true, Rico thought. She doesn\u0027t know!\n He watched her reach out toward a tasteless vest in a glass case that bore the inscription: \"Vest of Crista Galli, worn at age twelve. Not for sale.\" Also arranged about the case were various microscope slides with blood smears on them, a clipping of hair too obviously dark to be hers and several bits of cloth - all with price tags, all claiming to come from \"Her Holiness,\" Crista Galli. Above the case was scrawled a hand-lettered warning: \"Extreme danger, do not touch. Safety packaging included with each sale.\"\n You\u0027d think she\u0027d never seen a dog before, he thought, watching her, or a chicken - she sure went loony over those goddamn chickens.\n Rico dawdled close behind them and tried not to listen to their talk. He hadn\u0027t eaten since the previous morning and the charcoal spatter of hot food set his stomach rumbling. He was a little nervous, plenty could still go wrong. But the diversion had taken one patrol off their backs.\n If the boys are doing their jobs, we shouldn\u0027t see a security between here and the boat.\n Just as he thought it he knew better, but there was no calling the thought back and there was no calling back the two security guards rounding the corner ahead of them. Rico pressed a switch on the broadcast unit in his pocket. A third explosion went off near the harbor but neither guard took the bait. Rico sighed and adjusted the lasgun at the back of his waistband. It was an older model, short-range. He remembered thinking, as the two guards veered across the street toward them, how difficult it had become to buy spare charges.\n Ben and Crista saw the security and slowed to a stop. Commuters and street vendors pressed past them in waves. Rico stopped, too, a few paces behind them and in front of a deep hatchway. With the new explosion there was a renewed flurry among those crowding toward the harbor, and Rico was not happy that Ben had stopped. Both of the men approaching wore the khaki fatigues of the Vashon Security Forces, rank four. They were both burly, armed only with stunsticks, nearly normal but with the creased ears and fat lower lips betraying certain internal defects typical of Lummi Islanders.\n Just as Rico\u0027s hand clutched the grips of his lasgun, Crista Galli stepped forward, exaggerating the rolling walk of the heavily pregnant. She spoke, her hand upraised and head tilted in the Guemes fashion of greeting.\n \"Brothers,\" she said, \"this mother cannot find a rest station and she is in great need.\" This she delivered matter-of-factly, and turned her palm up. Though the guards were obviously jumpy, the response was automatic.\n \"Up two streets, one street left. The shops -\"\n The other security gave his partner a shove and interrupted: \"This could be the start of a Shadow attac... let\u0027s move! Sister, get out of the street. You two,\" he pointed to Ben and Rico, \"get her inside someplace and lay low.\"\n The two guards huffed toward their station at the harbor and Rico let out the breath he\u0027d been holding in a low whistle. It was a coded whistle, from their childhood days, that any Islander wot would recognize as \"all clear.\"\n \"You sure made Rico happy,\" Ben said, grinning.\n \"Got it all on tape, too,\" Rico said. He tapped a tiny lens at his shirtfront. \"It\u0027ll look great in your memoirs.\"\n He nodded at Crista.\n \"Good job thinking, helluva good job acting.\" He rechecked the charges in the camera at his belt and buffed the lapel lens with his sleeve. The lens looked like a small pin made of a glossy gray stone.\n \"Shouldn\u0027t we get out of here?\" Crista asked. \"You heard what he said, the Shadows -\"\n \"Are us,\" Rico interrupted in a whisper, \"and there will be no attack. The villagers might bust loose, though. Things are pretty hot. The Flying Fish is down there.\" He pointed out the \"Pier Four\" sign just ahead.\n One of the huge cross-bay ferries had surfaced dockside, unwilling to risk explosive damage in the comparatively shallow waters of the bay. Foot passengers from all over Pandora streamed out of the rear hatch, while two- and three-wheeled vehicles crowded the roadway. The morning dust changed to mud under all the feet and hosewater, and mud splashed up from wheels to stain the hems of fine Islander embroidery. Islanders even dressed up to go to market.\n About half of the crowd that elbowed back down the pier wore the plastic ID tag around their necks that marked them as Project Voidship employees. Whatever they did, they did it for Flattery\u0027s paycheck. This was a huge village, huge enough to strain the bonds of family, and today many of the dockside vendors threw catcalls and curses after the workers from the shuttle launch site.\n The pier itself was a bridge between two subway mouths - one from the village to the pier, and another that loaded onto the submarine ferry. Vendors crowded the station entrances, selling tubes of suntan lotion, sodas, dried fruits. Here the smell of charcoal and the spatter of grilled fish were drowned out in the babble of the crowds.\n Suddenly, one of Rico\u0027s greatest fears was made real. An Islander refugee, carrying a placard and wet to the skin from a firehosing, rushed down the crowded pier and attacked one of the commuters. They both fell in a tumble and, out of reflex as much as anger, the knot of commuters began kicking at him. Several dozen refugees tried in their weak way to free him, then to fight back, but within a matter of blinks they were all set upon and beaten.\n Rico and Ben closed tight on Crista Galli and Rico looked for a way down the pier. Screams of anger turned to grunts of pain all around them. Bodies splashed into the bay and the hot morning was filled with curses and the wet red smack of fists on skin.\n Crista kept her arms folded in front of her and her hands in her sleeves, like many of the old Islander women. She seemed locked in position with her hand out, like a figure from a wot\u0027s game of freeze-tag. As they worked through the crowd she stumbled on the Islander\u0027s battered placard and Rico saw that it read, \"Give a Brother a Break!\"\n A splintering sound and the wail of bent bracing came from behind them, then screams of fear. Rico saw, over his shoulder, that a portion of the pier had given way and hundreds of people spilled into the water.\n That might cool things for now, he thought, but not for long.\n \"Walk slower,\" Rico said at Crista Galli\u0027s ear. \"You\u0027re tired and pregnant and haven\u0027t eaten since last night.\"\n He knew that the last was true. He thought of all the meals he\u0027d missed as a wot, wondered when was the last time Crista Galli or the Director had missed a meal. He and Ben missed plenty working the news business, but that was different. When Rico was a wot, he hadn\u0027t chosen to go hungry.\n He scanned the beach where it broke out from the Islander settlement on the coast and flattened to a grassy plateau at the village perimeter. Security gathered there in their black personnel carriers, waiting for the crowd to tire before it was their turn to work them over. A bloody frenzy this close to the perimeter, and relatively open to beach and bay, might bring in dashers. The sight of a hunt of dashers would disperse the crowd, then security could take down the dashers and hardly wrinkle a crease in their fatigues.\n Rico\u0027s visual and electronic sweep of the area detected no signs of security on the pier itself. He had nothing that would detect the high-power listening devices that the Director favored lately.\n Crista stared straight ahead as they walked, eyes widely dilated, and Ben took her elbow.\n \"Tell them before we go that they are all one. Make them understand that they are all the same being and if they cut off their arms and legs they\u0027ll di...\"\n Ben gripped her elbow and gave it a shake. Rico saw her eyes as she turned to face him. They went from wild, wide and unfocused to normal. Rico noted that Ben was careful and didn\u0027t touch her skin.\n \"We\u0027re going to Port Hope,\" he lied, talking quickly as they walked. \"The lake there is beautiful this time of year, and even with the altitude you will find it warm at night. The older Islands are too vulnerable. We have strong loyalties among the Mermen but you can\u0027t move freely in their settlements down under. Our immediate danger is security. The Director\u0027s got spotter planes up all along the coast, particularly near the Preserve. Of course, there are his Skyhawks. At sea we are vulnerable to the kelp,\" he paused, and when Crista looked his way he nodded, then continued, \"and the Director\u0027s new fleet of foils, some of which he conveniently sold to Vashon security. Of course, we also have his spies among us.\"\n Rico was relieved. What Ben had said was for the benefit of listening devices, not for Crista Galli. He was sure, by her blank stare, that she had not understood a word.\n She shuffled on through the shouts and cries along Pier Four as though she heard nothing. Rico saw that there were more boats burning now, maybe a dozen, and firefighters were trying to push them away from the others. One of the Vashon Security Forces power foils steamed full-tilt toward the blaze from the Preserve side of the water.\n The Flying Fish, Holovision\u0027s private foil, was within sight at the end of the slip. Rico felt the tease of adrenaline in his belly. He hoped that Operations had briefed Elvira, pilot of the Flying Fish. She didn\u0027t much care for sudden changes of plans, and she really didn\u0027t like encounters with Vashon Security.\n Elvira was the toughest pilot that Holovision had ever hired. No one inconvenienced Elvira. To Rico\u0027s knowledge she had no politics, no hobbies, no friends and no religious convictions whatsoever. Her sole passion was to pilot the hottest hydrogen-ram foil in the world as often and as fast as possible. In surface mode she was highly competent; in undersea mode or flight she had no equal in the world. She had flown Ben and Rico in and out of more hot assignments than he could count. This would undoubtedly be the hottest.\n Ben caught Rico\u0027s gaze and raised a quizzical eyebrow, nodding toward the girl.\n Rico scratched his two-day beard. Crista turned to stare past him at the crowd that now had worked its way up the pier, gathering bodies and momentum, and was now fanning out into the streets of Kalaloch.\n Everyone who was to remember this event recalled that the morning air split with a crack like summer thunder, or a whip. No echo, not a breath of breeze. Even a cluster of fussing children nearby silenced themselves in their mother\u0027s skirts.\n Rico touched a fingertip to each of his ears, acutely conscious of the scratchings at each contour, each follicle and fold. If a shock wave had hit his ears, they\u0027d still be ringing.\n She did that in m... in our minds!\n Crista felt the sudden clap of stillness crack with her anger. She was glad that Ben and Rico were the first to recover, though what she saw in their eyes was clearly fear. The mob had stopped, momentarily stunned and looking about for a weapon, then it boiled anew at the onslaught of the truckloads of Vashon Security that came to meet it.\n Crista spun away from them and boarded the Flying Fish, still affecting the wide-beamed walk of the largely pregnant. She stood on the deck, beside the cabin hatchway, hugging herself and looking out to sea. The children started fussing again, stunned villagers rubbed their ears and began to move. Rico noticed that the boat fires had spread to the pier itself and some of the shops. Both ferries at the slip had submerged, empty, for safety. Rico approached Crista at the rail while Ben cast off the lines.\n \"This was coming for months,\" Rico said, \"you could tell by the feel in the streets. They\u0027ve had enough. It\u0027s too soon, and they\u0027re not organized. It will fail, for them. Some will be drawn out after us. Some, to the harbor. Others, to the attack that is inevitable inside the settlement. That will leave the Preserve wea...\"\n \"It\u0027s too well-protected,\" she said, her voice matter-of-fact. \"They will fail.\"\n She fixed Rico with those striking green eyes. He noticed, once again, that they were dilated in spite of the sunlight.\n \"I know how you felt now, back there, when you were so afraid of my touch.\" She smoothed the dress over her makeshift belly. \"What I know of the Shadows and what you know of me are the same. I only know what Flattery told me. I don\u0027t know whether you should fear my touch. Do you know whether I should fear yours?\"\n When he didn\u0027t answer she turned and shuffled into the cabin of the Holovision foil in silence.\n Evil is in the eye of the beholder.\n - Spider Nevi, special assistant to the Director\n Lights had been suitably dimmed in the Director\u0027s holo suite, and one tight spotlight illuminated his face from below. This effect accentuated Flattery\u0027s height, nearly a head taller than the average Pandoran, and it added an imperiousness to his stature that pleased him.\n An empty holo cassette teetered across the red armrest of his favorite recliner. One fluorescent orange sticker on the cassette read \"For Eyes Only,\" and under that was handwritten: \"TD, S. Nevi only.\" Under that was stamped in black: \"Extreme Penalty.\" Flattery smiled at the euphemism. At his direction, all those who violated the \"Extreme Penalty\" sanction became the homework of Spider Nevi\u0027s apprentice interrogators. Messy business, security.\n \"Mr. Nevi,\" he acknowledged, with a nod. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ascension-factor-destination-void-4/page-5.html","bookId":2172,"book":{"id":2172,"title":"The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4) \n As one of three survivours of the orbiting hibernation tanks, a Raja Flattery clone has established himself as \"Director\" of Pandora.
