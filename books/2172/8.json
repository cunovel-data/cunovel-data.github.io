She was a thousand meters above Kalaloch, and beneath her writhed a mass of brown tentacles.\n She was a hylighter, tacking her great sail across the breeze to keep the shadow of their foil in sight below. She was aware of herself, of her own being inside the foil, but felt every ripple along the hylighter\u0027s supple body as well.\n Ben Ozette was calling her name, barely audible at this distance. It seemed she shared an umbilicus from his navel to her own and he was pulling her in by it, reeling her back to the Flying Fish hand over hand.\n Ben touched her cheek and Crista snapped awake. He did not take his hand away.\n \"You scared me,\" he said. \"Your eyes were open and you quit breathing.\"\n As she sat forward, resisting his gentle pressure, she saw that Rico also stood over her, an open medical kit beside his feet. He was wearing gloves. What had been blue sky covering the plaz of the cabin was now the green-gray twilight of the middle deep. They were riding a kelpway, and somehow she knew that they had already cleared the harbor, heading north.\n Rico stared at Ben\u0027s hand stroking her cheek, then at Crista.\n \"I was gone,\" she said. \"Somewhere above us. I was a hylighter watching this foil and you reached out and brought me back.\"\n \"A hylighter?\" Ben laughed, but it was a tight, very nervous laugh. \"That\u0027s a strange enough dream.\n \u0027 Gasbag from the sky\n How her tentacles writhe\n for m...\u0027\n Remember that song? \u0027Come and Gon...\u0027\"\n \"I remember that it was some tasteless play on words, ridiculing the hylighter\u0027s spore-casting function. And this was no dream.\"\n She saw the snap in her voice reflected in the tightening of his lips, a closing off that she didn\u0027t know how to stop.\n Rico turned without saying anything and stowed the kit beneath his seat. Crista smelled something like anger, something like fear pulse from Rico\u0027s turned back. All of her senses washed back into her trembling body, delivering her into a state of hypersensitivity that she had never known before.\n The undersea landscape of blues and greens blurred past her like the settlement had blurred past her - too much wonder, too little time.\n Of everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required; and of him to whom they have entrusted much, they will demand the more.\n - Jesus\n Beatriz was awaiting her cue for the two-minute windup of News-break when the fully armed security detachment entered the studio, sliding from the hatchway with their backs along the walls. They hung back beyond the fringe of lights, which blazed their reflection in the squad leader\u0027s mirrored sunglasses. Her mouth was suddenly dry, her throat tightening, and she was due for the wrap-up in thirty seconds.\n Still on the air, she thought. The preempt isn\u0027t running yet.\n Her console showed her what the three cameras saw, but the monitor at the rear of the studio showed what went out on the air. Now it showed Harlan fast-talking the weather.\n It could be bypassed.\n She shuddered in her newfound paranoia and thought that the floor director would probably stop Harlan if they\u0027d gone to tape, but she couldn\u0027t be sure anymore.\n Maybe they want to see just how much more I\u0027d try to say.\n She had deviated from the prompter, amid the waving hands of the producer and director. She hadn\u0027t linked Ben with the Galli kidnapping, she\u0027d just listed him as missing, along with Rico, on assignment. She noted signs of surprise and muttering among the crew when she said it. Both Ben and Rico were admired in the industry. Indeed, many of Rico\u0027s inventions and innovations made the holo industry possible.\n Harlan finished morning fishing patterns, and the countdown went to Beatriz. The officer of the security squad had moved up in the studio and placed a man beside each of her cameramen. She had the sudden, weighty thought that her crew might not be on the shuttle this afternoon.\n Harlan finished and smiled from the monitor, and the floor director\u0027s fingers counted her down: Three, two, on...\n \"That\u0027s our morning Newsbreak from our launch site studios. Evening Newsbreak will be broadcast live from our Orbital Assembly Station. Our crew will have the opportunity to accompany the OMC, Organic Mental Core, and take you, the viewer, through each step of installation and testing. Other news that we will follow at that time: the abduction of Crista Galli. As you know, there is still no word from her abductors and no ransom demand. More on this and other news at eighteen. Good morning.\"\n Beatriz held her smile until the red light faded out, then slumped back into her chair with a sigh. The studio erupted around her in a babble of questions.\n \"What\u0027s this about Ben?\"\n \"Rico, too? Where were they?\"\n \"Does the company know about this?\"\n They cared. She knew they would care, that most of Pandora probably cared, and that was her power. As the mirrored sunglasses made their way through the crew toward her, she knew that there was nothing he could do. Even if they\u0027d preempted and run the canned show, the crew knew and there would be no keeping this leak plugged.\n When the security officer reached her, the babbling in the studio fell quiet.\n \"I must ask you to come with us.\"\n These were the words she\u0027d been afraid she might hear. These words, \"Come with us,\" were what Ben had tried to warn her about for the last couple of years. He had said more than once, \"If they ask you to come, don\u0027t do it. They will take you away and you will disappear. They will take the people around you away. If they say this to you, make whatever happens happen in public, where they can\u0027t hide it from the world.\"\n \"Roll cameras one, two and three,\" she announced. Then she turned to Gus, the floor director. \"Were we preempted?\"\n \"No,\" he said, and his voice trembled. He was sweating heavily even though she was the one under the lights. \"If a preempt signal was sent, I didn\u0027t see it. You went out live.\"\n God bless Gus! she thought.\n She turned to the security.\n \"Now, Captai... I didn\u0027t get your nam... what was it you wanted of me?\"\n What then shall we do?\n - Leo Tolstoy\n \"Trimmed and steady,\" Elvira reported. \"No pursuit. Course?\"\n When Ben didn\u0027t answer, Rico said, \"Victoria.\"\n Elvira grunted.\n It was obvious to Crista that Elvira trusted both Ben and Rico completely. She had seen loyalty at the Preserve, but never trust. She had manipulated the distrust rampant throughout Flattery\u0027s organization to open the hatch for her escape. That same distrust would bring Flattery down, once and for all. Of this she was certain.\n \"Flattery\u0027s people hoard information like spinarettes at the web,\" she told Ben. \"It\u0027s barter to them, a medium of exchange. So no one has the full picture and rumor guides the hand that blesses or damns. That\u0027s why Shadowbox has threatened him more than anything else.\"\n \"There\u0027s food in the galley,\" Rico announced, and she saw the accompanying green indicator flash on the console at her right hand. \"Ben, you two take a break. Bring me back some coffee. We\u0027re a few hours out yet. Elvira would like the usual.\"\n Ben led Crista to the galley behind the cabin with a hand at her elbow. Her legs seemed wobbly in spite of the even-keeled submersible run of the foil. She had been hungry now for hours. Her head ached with it, and the memory of broiled sebet on the village air charged her stomach.\n \"We live in the galley,\" Ben told her. \"When we\u0027re on a job, this room is jammed, it\u0027s where everything happens.\"\n She stepped from the semidim cabin into a warm yellow glow. The galley was a bright room of wood, yellowpanel and brass. She could imagine a Holovision Nightly News crew spread out over the two tables with coffee and notes in the half-hour before air time. It was a clean, well-lighted space. Holo cubes of the crew in action on various assignments sat in a rack against the inboard bulkhead. Crista sat at the first of two hexagonal tables and pulled down a couple of the cubes to look at.\n \"These really stand out at you,\" she said, moving the holograms through different angles of light. \"Nothing in Flattery\u0027s collection matches these for quality.\"\n \"Thanks to Rico,\" Ben said. \"He\u0027s a born inventor. He\u0027d be a rich man today if Flattery\u0027s Merman Mercantile hadn\u0027t jumped into the middle of things. Our stuff is good because Rico makes up the equipment himself. We always roll with the best.\"\n \"She\u0027s very pretty,\" Crista said, holding a scene of Ben and Beatriz with their arms around each other. \"You two have worked together for a long time. Were you in love, the two of you?\"\n Ben cleared his throat and pushed a few buttons. She heard the whirr of galley machinery at work.\n \"Now it\u0027s hard to know whether we were truly in love or whether we\u0027d just survived so much together that we felt no one else could understand - except maybe Rico, of course.\"\n \"And you made love with her?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n Ben stood with his back to her, staring at the backs of his hands on the countertop. \"Yes, we made love. For several years. Given our lives, it would have been impossible that we didn\u0027t become intimates.\"\n \"But now you\u0027re not?\"\n She saw the slightest shake of the back of his head. \"No.\"\n \"Does that make you sad? Do you miss her?\"\n When he turned to her she saw the consternation on his face, the struggle he seemed to be having with words. She thought perhaps he\u0027d started out to lie to her, but with a sigh he changed his mind.\n \"Yes,\" he said, \"I miss her. Not as a lover, that\u0027s past and would be too clumsy to rekindle. I miss working with her because she\u0027s so goddamn good at getting people to talk in front of cameras. Rico handled the techno stuff, and between us she and I could get to the bottom of most anything. I think she\u0027s in love with MacIntosh up in Current Control, but I don\u0027t think she\u0027s admitted it, yet. If it\u0027s true, it should make life easier for both of us.\"\n \"If one of you is in love, then that takes the heat off?\"\n Ben laughed. \"I suppose you could say that, yes.\"\n She lowered her gaze to the cube that her hands passed back and forth in front of her. \"Could you ever be in love with me?\"\n He laughed a soft laugh and gripped her shoulder.\n \"I remember everything about you,\" he said. \"That first day I saw you in Flattery\u0027s lab, when you looked at me over your shoulder and smile... I had a feeling when our eyes met like I\u0027ve never had before. I still get it every time I see you, think of you, dream of you. Isn\u0027t that something like love?\"\n Her pale skin flushed red from the neck of her dress to the roots of her shaggy white hair at her forehead.\n \"It\u0027s the same for me,\" she said. \"But I have nothing to compare with. And how could I live up to whatever you\u0027ve shared wit... her?\"\n \"Love isn\u0027t a competition,\" he said. \"It happens. There were tough times, living with B, but I don\u0027t have to bring up the bad parts to punish myself for missing the friendship, the good parts. I think she and I are both people who refuse to dislike someone we\u0027ve loved. She\u0027s an exceptional person or I wouldn\u0027t have loved her. There was a lot of bliss, a lot of turmoil, no boredom at all. The bliss part she called \u0027our convergent lines.\u0027 Ultimately we each blamed the other for being impossible when it was our situation we couldn\u0027t bea...\"\n \"Did you take the job of interviewing me because you knew that she was working with Flattery at the Preserve?\"\n He laughed again.\n \"You have me pegged, don\u0027t you? That\u0027s a yes and no answer. I thought, and still think, that your story is the most exciting thing I can show the rest of Pandora. I wouldn\u0027t have tried for it otherwise. But, yes, I did hope, in a moment of wallowing in loneliness, that I\u0027d see her again.\"\n \"An... ?\"\n \"I did. The thrill was gone and we were good friends. Good friends who still work very well together.\"\n \"You knew that Flattery was buying us both off with those interviews, didn\u0027t you?\" Crista asked.\n She set her hat beside her on the deck and peeled off her headband and mantilla. She gave her matted hair a shake. She was relieved that he smiled at this as he gathered their utensils at the sideboard.\n \"I figured it out,\" he said. \"That\u0027s wh... this. Flattery pulled the corporate strings, denying air time before the first can was shot. But no one was told. I was paid, you were interviewed at length on five occasions - and this was the story of the century! He paid to have it done so he could kill it.\"\n \"Yes,\" she said, \"with no pangs of conscience whatsoever. Look what it got him: We are here, together. I, at least, am happier. And hungry,\" she indicated her disguise, \"in spite of how it looks.\"\n Ben patted the lump of clothing strapped to her belly. \"And fulfilled, too,\" he teased. He dared to stroke her cheek again with a smile and then busied himself setting out the food.\n She watched the seascape as their foil slithered through the kelpways, her quick breaths fogging the plaz. Though the Preserve was a seaside base camp Crista never once had been allowed down to the shore. Flattery feared her relationship with the kelp, and saw to it that others around her did, too.\n Ben nudged her shoulder and pointed through the starboard port toward the skeletal remains of a kelp outpost, dimly visible in the foil\u0027s deepwater lights. The kelp itself had been burned back to knobby stumps for a thousand meters all around.\n \"Report says kelp killed three families here, sixteen people,\" he said. \"Vashon Security did their retaliatory number on the kelp, as you can see. They call it \u0027pruning.\u0027\"\n Though it was shadowland beneath a weak wash of light and though the engines had quieted in submersible mode, Crista focused on the tingle at her shoulder where Ben had touched her. She fought back tears of joy at his touch. How could she explain this to him, who touched people and was touched at will?\n He pulled two hot trays out of the unit and set them on the table. He dealt out napkins, spoons, chopsticks. She knew she needed food, strength, but some dreaminess had caught her up since boarding the foil and she didn\u0027t really want to shake it.\n Sunlight strengthened her, this she knew. The beautiful kiss from Ben, that strengthened her, too. Something about this Rico LaPush also strengthened her, but she didn\u0027t know what.\n Crista glanced again at Ben, beside her, as his eyes searched the dimness of the passing landscape.\n \"The Preserve is under attack,\" Ben said. She didn\u0027t respond. \"You can watch it onscreen if you want.\" He indicated the briefing screen against the aft galley bulkhead. She preferred the old word \"wall,\" but not many used it. Tribute to Pandora\u0027s watery history.\n Though Ben talked on, Crista concentrated on her meal, eating half of Ben\u0027s as well, leaving him the vegetables. His words buzzed like a fat bee in the warm galley air. All the while a lullaby kept running through her head that no human ear had heard in two thousand years.\n Hush little baby don\u0027t say a word\n Momma\u0027s gonna buy you a mockingbir...\n She had learned to be cautious wandering her memories, too. When the flashbacks started sometimes they took over, unpeeling whole sections of other people\u0027s lives. They lasted longer each time, dragging Crista through hours of lightning-fast memories. There was no focus, no fine-tuning, simply off or on.\n First it was blinks, then seconds, moments. A minute of high-speed memory, lived with a full sensory component, could wring an entire lifetime out of the wet cloth of her mind. Her last flashback had terminated only after exhaustion and heavy sedation. It had lasted nearly four hours. Though conscious immediately, she had been dazed and unable to speak for three days. Flattery had used this as an excuse to further limit her life at his compound, and to adjust her medications.\n She felt that same dazedness now, but no onslaught of memories, no sweat, no fear.\n \"Crista Galli,\" Ben said, \"you have quite the life awaiting you. You are \u0027the One, Her Holiness,\u0027 a living legend. You are the most important person alive today.\"\n She felt an uneasiness at what he said, and sought reason to feel uneasy at the way he said it. She found none.\n \"\u0027The One\u0027?\" she muttered. \"\u0027The One\u0027 to do what?\"\n \"You are the One for whom they have waited in suffering for so long,\" he said. \"Depending on whom you believe, you are the last salvation of humankind, or you are the kelp\u0027s secret weapon to eradicate humans forever. In your glimpse of the people of Kalaloch you must have felt your power. There is a lot for you to learn, and quickly. We will help you with that. But because one does not touch a god, one does not come before a god scratching one\u0027s fleas, you will see only the best side of the faithful, and the worst side of the rest.\"\n \"When the people know me, know it\u0027s all a -\"\n \"They will not know you,\" he interrupted. \"Not the \u0027you\u0027 that you mean. They want to believe something else too much to stop them. Faith can do that.\n \"You must be careful, you must be quiet. And you must be a mystery. We need that mystery to beat Flattery. You will see plenty of need before very much longer, and I think you will agree with me. Eat the rest if you are hungry. We may not always be among those who have food.\"\n She was hungry, very hungry. She drank the broth from her soup, left the vegetables and picked out the meat. She also picked out the meat from the sandwich he made her. She ate the bread in tiny bites to make it last longer.\n She thought she could tell Ben, tell them all something of need. Touch was a human need and she was mostly human. At times someone would touch her by accident or quickly in a breathless dare. The daring ones, she recognized now, must be the religious zealots, the Zavatans that Ben had told her about. There was no way to know which way it would be: embarrassment or death.\n When she let Ben kiss her the previous night she had known it was possible that he would die. She had the strongest feeling that she would die, too, and somehow that made it all right. For the first time she felt mortal, and risked it. When neither of them died, she even kissed him back a little. Her heart pumped something like fear, even at the memory. Afterward, in his green eyes so nearly like her own, there was the glitter of laughter and a good dare taken.\n He looked so happy!\n She remembered that few people around her had ever looked happy, except the Director. Mostly, they seemed afraid.\n \"Why did you kiss me?\" she asked. A flush crept out of her collar. She didn\u0027t want to look at him but finally couldn\u0027t help it. He was smiling.\n \"Because you let me.\"\n \"You weren\u0027t afrai... ?\"\n \"Afraid you wouldn\u0027t like it? Yes. Afraid of what you might do to me? No.\" He laughed. \"I have a theory. If people expect to go crazy when they touch you, then that\u0027s what they do. It\u0027s a hysteria, that\u0027s al...\"\n She put her palm on his chest and said, evenly, \"You don\u0027t know anything about me. You were luck... we were lucky.\" She patted his shirt. \"You didn\u0027t sleep,\" she said. \"If it\u0027s necessary that one of us sit up, I can do it from now on.\"\n Something dark passed over his expression.\n \"There were arrangements,\" he said, \"with some of the women we\u0027ll meet upcoast - you were to stay with them. It was assumed that you would prefe...\"\n \"It has to be you,\" she insisted. \"You have no woman in your life, isn\u0027t that right?\"\n \"That\u0027s right, but it\u0027s not a matter o...\"\n \"What\u0027s it a matter of?\" she blurted. \"Don\u0027t you like me?\"\n Maybe it was the surprise that lifted the darkness from his face, or maybe it was the blush. \"I like you,\" he said. \"I like you a lot.\"\n \"Then it\u0027s settled,\" she said. \"I can stay with you.\"\n \"It\u0027s not as easy as that.\"\n \"It is if we make it so,\" she said. \"Get some rest between now and then. If you really are immune to me, you\u0027re going to need it.\"\n Intervention into destiny by god or man requires the most delicate care.\n - Dwarf MacIntosh, Kelpmaster, Current Control\n Raja Flattery\u0027s private bunker lay safely beneath almost thirty meters of Pandoran stone.
