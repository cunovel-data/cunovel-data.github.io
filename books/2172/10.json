This kelp grew up expecting to be left alone. It learned reaction only after its vines twined with domestic kelp. It learned to kill when threatened and to show no mercy. Then it learned to expect retaliation for killing.\\n\\n This Immensity expected to live forever. Logic dictated that it would not live forever if it continued reacting to humans. And now, the One was passing! It knew this as surely as the blind snapperfish knows the presence of muree.\\n\\n The original Immensity of kelp, Avata, encompassed all of the seas of Pandora under one consciousness, one voice, one \"being.\" Its first genetic extinction came early in the formation of the planet. It had been at the mercy of a fungus. A burst of ultraviolet from a huge sunstorm killed off the fungus. Somewhere, a primitive frond lay mummified in a salt bog awaiting Pandora\u0027s first ocean.\\n\\n The second extinction was by human beings, by a human bioengineer named Jesus Lewis. The kelp was teased back to life by a few DNA miners about fifty years later. The revitalized kelp that the Mermen resurrected was developed from these early experiments. Now kelp once again filled the seas, dampening the murderous storms.\\n\\n Once again the great stands scattered scent. They grew close with the years, their fronds spoke the chemical tongue. This Immensity itself retained two and a quarter million cubic kilometers of ocean.\\n\\n The One rode a kelpway that skimmed the Immensity\u0027s reach. This particular kelpway came out of a stand of blue kelp that had been known to attack its own kind, overpowering nearby stands, sucking out their beings and injecting its own. It had suffered many prunings, and was sorely in need of guidance. This the Immensity knew from snatches of terror that drifted in on torn fronds. The One could not be trusted to such a dangerous stand. At whatever cost, the One must be spared.\\n\\n The kelp shifted itself slightly, against the electrical stings from Current Control, to bring the One into its outmost currents, spiraling into the safer deeps of its own stand.\\n\\n You have been educated in judgment, which is the essence of worship. Judgment always occurs in the past. It is past-thinking. Will, free or otherwise, is concerned with the future. Thinking is the performance of the moment, out of which you use your judgment to modulate will. You are a convection center through which past prepares future.\\n\\n - Dwarf MacIntosh, Kelpmaster, from Conversations with the Avata\\n\\n \"Course change.\"\\n\\n Elvira\u0027s voice was emotionless as rock but Rico detected the slightest edge of worry in the flurry of her fingers across her command console. She never piloted the foil in its voice mode because she preferred to speak as seldom as possible. That Elvira had spoken at all worried him - that, and the increasing shimmy that had begun a few minutes back.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n When working with Elvira, Rico picked up her habit of non-speech. She seemed to like that.\\n\\n \"Channel change,\" she said, nodding toward her screen. \"We\u0027re being steered off course.\"\\n\\n \"Steered?\" he muttered, and checked his own instruments. They maintained their position in the kelpway, but their compass said the huge undersea corridor was running in the wrong direction.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s doing the steering?\"\\n\\n Elvira shrugged, still busy with her keyboard. She had taken them deep into sub train traffic to minimize tracking, and they ran without the help of sensors that would light their progress through the kelpways.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re out of the wild kelp sector outside Flattery\u0027s launch site,\" he said, \"that\u0027s where the weirdness usually happens.\"\\n\\n One-half of his screen displayed the navigation grid projected by Current Control from its command center aboard the Orbiter. The other half of the screen tracked their actual course through the grid, which now appeared to be bent.\\n\\n Bending, he corrected himself. It looks like our whole end of the screen is pouring down a drain.\\n\\n \"Anything on the Navcom?\" he asked.\\n\\n Sometimes Current Control changed grids through the kelp to accommodate weather conditions further upchannel or the recent stumping of a stand of rogue kelp.\\n\\n \"Negative,\" she said. \"All clear.\"\\n\\n The ride began to get bumpy and Rico cinched himself tighter to his couch. He keyed the intercom and said, \"Rough water, everybody cinch up. Ben, you\u0027d better come up here.\"\\n\\n Below them Rico could see another cargo train careening dangerously close to the kelp, attempting to recover from the sudden change. Their dive lights showed him that the kelp seemed to be in a struggle with itself, fluttering the channel as if pressing against a great force.\\n\\n Ben used the hand grips along the bulkhead to work his way to his console.\\n\\n \"Can we get Current Control?\" Ben asked. He dropped into his couch and cinched up.\\n\\n \"Not without giving up our position.\"\\n\\n \"We got out too easy,\" Ben said. \"They\u0027ve got a bug on this thing, anywa...\"\\n\\n \"Had,\" Rico said, smiling. \"I did an E-sweep when we left the harbor, thinking the same thing. Found it. Elvira here jettisoned the little devil into a netful of krill that we passed about a dozen grids back.\"\\n\\n \"Good work, both of you,\" Ben said. \"All right, then let\u0027s try that cargo train belo...\"\\n\\n The Flying Fish was buffeted again by something like a huge fist. Elvira wrestled with the controls to keep them out of the kelp.\\n\\n Rico knew, as they all knew, that any damage to the kelp could be construed as an attack. A lot of kelp lights were active in this sector. Besides the red and blue telltales of a waking stand, this kelp flashed its cold navigation light at random and occasionally flooded them with the brighter fiber-optic sunlight that it transported from the surface. If the stand was one that had awakened, any mistake could get the foil and themselves torn apart at the seams.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t Flattery just go on the air to tell us how safe he\u0027d made the kelpways?\"\\n\\n \"Just goes to show,\" Rico said, \"you can\u0027t believe that bastard for a goddamn blink.\"\\n\\n The cargo train passing in the opposite direction beneath them was having even more trouble than they were. A relatively tiny foil could stop in midchannel and hover if necessary, but the cargo train needed to maintain a constant speed for maneuverability. The grid system was set up so that the trains, Pandora\u0027s lifeline, could travel the kelpways swiftly and undisturbed with minimal course changes. From what Rico could see of the bucking cargo, the crew below at both ends of the train had their hands full.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s bending,\" Rico said, watching the Navcom monitor that marked out their grid system. \"The whole grid\u0027s bending.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027d better surface,\" Ben said. \"Prepare for -\"\\n\\n \"Negative,\" Elvira said. \"If this is a surface disturbance, things will be worse up there. We need information.\"\\n\\n Ben grunted acknowledgment.\\n\\n \"Cargo train identity signal is registered to the Simplicity Maru,\" Elvira reported, fighting the controls to maintain hover and an equidistance between walls of the kilometer-wide channel. This ordinarily simple maneuver was made nearly impossible by the ever-changing walls of their kelpway. Rico noticed a sweat beading on Elvira\u0027s brow and upper lip.\\n\\n Ben keyed for a low-frequency broadcast. He hoped he didn\u0027t have to explain the absence of their identity signal.\\n\\n \"Simplicity Maru, this is Quicksilver,\" he lied. \"Do you have reports on current disruption?\"\\n\\n Static hissed back at them, then a microphone clicked on. The message came in badly broken. Undersea communication, especially around active kelp, was always difficult.\\n\\n \"Sim... Maru. Negativ... into kelp.\" There was the sound of shrieking metal in the background... . king up. We are preparin... ballast. Repeat, preparin...\"\\n\\n Elvira threw the throttles forward and in spite of a violent buffeting the foil leaped at her touch. Her lips were pressed into a tight line and her knuckles shone white on the controls.\\n\\n \"Wait, we can\u0027...\" Ben said. His body pressed further into his couch. \"We can\u0027t go into deep kelp.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re blowing ballast,\" Elvira growled. \"That whole cargo train\u0027s going to pop up into us like a cork.\"\\n\\n Rico felt every fixture aboard rattle like his teeth.\\n\\n \"Ben, is the girl secure?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s strapped in,\" Ben said.\\n\\n Just then they cleared the rear cabin of the train. It blew past them toward the surface, containers and cabins tumbling like toys. A few of the containers snagged in the walls of the kelpway, walls that still vibrated with light and that same strange force.\\n\\n \"This is too weird,\" Ben said. \"Let\u0027s surface and take our chances with the Director\u0027s air cover. This ride\u0027s getting much too ugly.\"\\n\\n Elvira nodded curtly and the foil started its ascent. As though alerted by their control panel, the kelp fronds began closing above the Flying Fish. First they formed a canopy, then, a tight and impenetrable mesh. A sudden change of current lurched them to starboard and sent the foil tumbling end over end. Elvira righted them manually, her face very pale.\\n\\n \"Shit!\" Ben fisted the arm of his couch. \"Somehow Flattery must\u0027ve got to Current Contro...\" He snicked his harness release over Rico\u0027s protests.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m checking on Crista,\" Ben said.\\n\\n He had to use the handholds to make his way aft on the rolling deck. At the galley\u0027s hatch he turned, suddenly a bit pale himself, and Rico knew what thought had just struck Ben. Rico smiled.\\n\\n \"Rico,\" Ben said, \"what i...\"\\n\\n \"What if the kelp knows she\u0027s here?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Ben said. \"What if the kelp knows she\u0027s here?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027d better hope she likes us.\"\\n\\n \"She probably doesn\u0027t have any say in this,\" Ben said, and undogged the hatch. Rico didn\u0027t care for the snap in his voice.\\n\\n \"Somebody has a say in this,\" Rico muttered. The hatch slammed, dogged itself. That was when Rico remembered when the kelp could have had a whiff of Crista Galli. It was the only time that hull integrity had been breached.\\n\\n That bug! he thought. That goddamn little mercuroid chip of Flattery\u0027s.\\n\\n \"We ejected that transmitter, Elvira, and we ejected it in cabin air.\" He thought he detected an infinitesimal stiffening of her posture. \"If that kelp can sniff, and I hear it can, then it knows there\u0027s more in this can than us worms.\"\\n\\n Mercenary captains either are or are not skilful soldiers. If they are, you cannot trust them, for they will always seek to gain power for themselves either by oppressing you, the master, or by oppressing others against your wishes.\\n\\n - Machiavelli, The Prince\\n\\n The young security captain, Yuri Brood, was rumored by his men to be the unacknowledged son of the Director, product of an early tryst with a Merman woman from the Domes. The men based this notion on the strong physical resemblance between Brood and the Director, and on Brood\u0027s quick rise to an advisorship that went beyond the formalities of his rank. The two men shared a ruthlessness that did not go unnoticed outside the confines of the squad.\\n\\n Captain Brood and his squad had been reared in a Merman compound near this Kalaloch district. Brood himself had been schooled privately in the mathematics of logic and strategy - that was standard operating procedure for anyone anticipating an executive position with Merman Mercantile. Brood himself preferred the more direct solutions of physical pressure to the subtleties of politics. His superiors shrugged it off as a phase, agreeing that Brood got results where others failed.\\n\\n The old families, Islander and Merman alike, retained a strong sense of loyalty to their community that made the kind of enforcement that Flattery demanded impossible from within. Security command removed Captain Brood\u0027s team to Mesa for their training and formation of their combat bond, then deployed them to Kalaloch and its shuttle launch site for \"police work.\" They were one another\u0027s only family, an Island adrift in a sea of enemy. Everyone was kept three villages away from home.\\n\\n Survive your tour, advance your rank, retire to an office at the Preserve - this was the universal goal.\\n\\n The young captain was afraid, and he wasn\u0027t afraid often. When he was afraid, heads rolled. He and his team were short-timers at one month remaining, just starting their countdown to home. The captain had something to return home to, and he intended to rotate on schedule. He intended that his men rotate back home with him, alive. For a year his district had been Kalaloch and the SLS. His squad\u0027s actions had drawn more citations than a dress suit could hold. During that year either the site or his men had been under fire daily.\\n\\n Today the captain faced Beatriz Tatoosh from the back of the studio, and he thought what a pity it would be to have to kill her.\\n\\n Beatriz did not know what the captain thought, but fear dried out her mouth when she saw his squad enter behind the lights and fan out along the bulkhead backing the studio.\\n\\n The captain pointed out each of the live cameras to three of his men. They pulled away from their squad, drew lasguns and without a word each took careful aim at a cameraman.\\n\\n Beatriz heard gasps, curses, the arming of weapons. It was difficult to see what was happening because of the glare in her eyes. The large monitor at the back of the studio cleared, then displayed a tape of the last launch, a tape cut by Beatriz and her present team.\\n\\n We\u0027re not going out live! she thought.\\n\\n \"Dak,\" she alerted her floor man, \"check the monitor.\"\\n\\n When her gaze left the monitor it caught the young captain watching her. She remembered seeing him before, his dark eyes flashing her a smile as he led his squad through the labyrinth of the launch site. He half-smiled now, and nodded at her, and with that nod his three men executed her three cameramen.\\n\\n At the first shot she was stunned at the suddenness of it all, the audacity as much as the horror. At the second shot it was the smell of death itself that stunned her. At the third shot she faced the immediacy of her own death. She also faced the captain, who was no longer smiling.\\n\\n She remembered thinking how hard everyone was breathing just then, how the second guard stood over her dead cameraman and said to the first, \"Shit, man, that was no signa...\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, man,\" the third one said. \"It\u0027s done. Just shut up. It don\u0027t change nothing here at all.\"\\n\\n \"All right!\"\\n\\n The captain fanned his fingers out from his left palm and the rest of the squad sealed off the studio area. She started to tremble, then concentrated on controlling it so that the captain wouldn\u0027t see.\\n\\n Ben was right! replayed through her mind. And who will know?\\n\\n Beatriz watched the replay of herself on the monitor, interviewing the Director during one of his ritual visits to the launch site. The expression on her face onscreen, one of admiration and deference, now made her sick to her stomach. Even so, her eyes stayed on the screen, rather than face the unbelievable reality unreeling in her studio.\\n\\n Through the shock and the trembling she heard Harlan\u0027s voice from the back of the studio, speeding through a Zavatan chant for the dead. She remembered that the skinny cameraman with the fanlike ears on number three was Harlan\u0027s cousin. The security who had shot him was now dragging him by the feet to the wall. The cameraman\u0027s head bumped over the sprawl of cables across the deck, the hole in his chest burned so clean it barely bled.\\n\\n The three assassins took wider positions in the room. Fifteen people were being held by nine guards in a very small studio with some very hot lights. The captain scanned the studio once, then turned to Beatriz. He indicated the red lights on the triangulators.\\n\\n \"The red light means the camera is on, correct? It is still recording?\"\\n\\n She did not answer. She felt it was important that he didn\u0027t hear her voice quaver. She could not take her eyes from his eyes.\\n\\n He did not smile this time, nor did he nod.\\n\\n \"Finish them,\" he said. Then he nodded at Beatriz, \"Except for her.\"\\n\\n The screams, the pleading, the curses with Flattery\u0027s name on them silenced in the few moments it took the captain to walk her to the hatchway. It seemed that she walked forever, because there were the bodies of her crew to step over, and her legs were so uncharacteristically unsteady.\\n\\n \"Now see what you have done,\" Brood said to her. He squeezed her upper arm and shook her. \"See what a mess your broadcast has made.\"\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t speak or she would cry, and she didn\u0027t want to cry for him. She slapped away his touch when he took her arm to steady her. The last body she had to step over to reach the hatchway was the makeup girl\u0027s.\\n\\n What was her name? Beatriz felt a new panic rise. I can\u0027t blank out her nam... !\\n\\n It was Nephertiti, yes, Nephertiti. Someone pretty and dark-skinned, like herself, with wide eyes. She told herself to remember this, to remember it and to see that somehow, sometime the world would know.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a cool one,\" the captain told her. \"You probably saw worse than this at Mesa two years back.\"\\n\\n She stopped in the hatchway and turned, still not speaking.\\n\\n \"I saw you there, too,\" he said. \"I saw both you and your boyfriend bounced ass over teakettle when that mine blew up your rig. Thought you both bought it.\"\\n\\n She nodded, started to say, \"So did we,\" but nothing came out of her throat but a croak.\\n\\n For the first time she noticed his name, stitched above the Vashon Security insignia at his left breast: \"Brood.\" Her only wish right now was that she would live long enough to see Captain Brood die.\\n\\n He turned back to the studio and its seventeen dead warm bodies. Beatriz looked once again at herself on the monitor. The tape replayed an interview with Dwarf MacIntosh, Kelpmaster of Current Control. He was one of the few humans, other than Flattery, to survive the opening of the hyb tanks twenty-five years ago. He was so tall she\u0027d had to stand on a box to do the interview. She had met him on her first flight to the new orbital complex, the day after her last night with Ben. Within a month she was sure that she was in love.\\n\\n \"Bag \u0027em up,\" the captain told his men. \"Squeegee this place down, seal it off, then get all their production shit aboard.\"\\n\\n He bowed to her then, opened the hatch for her and said, \"We\u0027re expecting the replacements for your crew any minute. They are my men, and will do as they\u0027re told. My squad and I will travel along, to see that you do, too.\"\\n\\n The mind at ease is a dead mind.\\n\\n - Dwarf MacIntosh, Kelpmaster, Current Control\\n\\n Dwarf MacIntosh floated in the turretlike chamber of Current Control and surveyed the planet below for the birth of a certain squall at sea. It happened at about this time every day that a swirl of clouds materialized over Pandora\u0027s largest wild kelp bed. It was some comfort now to see this squall forming; it told him that something was normal today even though the behavior of the kelp was completely loco. Today, humans didn\u0027t make much sense to him, either.\\n\\n \"The Turret,\" as he called it, was a plasma-glass extravagance of materials and workmanship that MacIntosh had fabricated for himself before installing Current Control in the orbital station.\\n\\n I\u0027d have taken the job anyway, Mack admitted, but only to himself. \"Kelpmaster\" wasn\u0027t so much a job to him as it was a privilege. He couldn\u0027t have allowed any of Flattery\u0027s goons such an easy throttlehold on the kelp. Besides, he felt much more comfortable in orbit than he did on Pandora\u0027s surface.\\n\\n Like Flattery, Mack had been cloned, raised and trained in the sterility of Moonbase, in the hyperregimentation and clonophobia of Moonbase. His whole life, until hybernation, had been spent orbiting an Earth that, for him and for all clones, never existed. In those days, Flattery had openly pined for a life Earthside, but even then Dwarf MacIntosh looked outward, past Earth\u0027s measly system to the possibilities beyond.\\n\\n From his turret Mack observed and charted many of these possibilities. He named them, but not the few special names he saved for his unborn children. He had spent the past two years above Pandora, refusing the usual R\u0026R rotations groundside. In that time MacIntosh had not recognized a single star that would lead them Earthward. He liked it that way.\\n\\n Dwarf MacIntosh awoke from hybernation on Pandora one day in indescribable pain and found himself in the middle of nowhere, galactically speaking. In spite of the planet\u0027s horrors he was in his own heaven among a trillion brand-new stars. The other survivors clung to that little wretch of a planet and most of them died there. Alyssa Mars... well, she died, too. She died the day Moonbase started imprinting her for backup OMC.\\n\\n Mack and Flattery shared a dream of driving further into the void. Mack felt it a pity, in a way, since he had never liked Flattery, even during training with him back at Moonbase. Their differences had come out lately over management of the kelp.\\n\\n If Flattery had any idea of what we\u0027ve done, of what the kelp i...\\n\\n \"Dr. MacIntosh, shuttle\u0027s set for launch.\"\\n\\n Mack handed himself out of the turret and with one foot-thrust sailed across the huge control room to his personal console. Spud Soleus, his first assistant, busied himself at the primary terminal.\\n\\n A glance at the number six display told Mack that the kelp in the SLS sector was performing as directed. The number eight display was a different story, however. The great kelp bed down-coast of Victoria was still a writhing tangle. No telling how many freighters were lost in there. He punched up another batch of coffee.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the delay?\"\\n\\n Spud shrugged his skinny shoulders, keeping to his console.\\n\\n \"They said something about replacements for the news crew. You know Flattery, can\u0027t do anything without crowing to the press.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s been replaced?\" he asked. He felt his heart jump a bit. He\u0027d been hopin... no, planning to see Beatriz Tatoosh again. He\u0027d thought about Beatriz Tatoosh daily from the moment her shuttle left nearly two months ago. His dreams took up where his thoughts left off, and he had dreamed up the hope that she could make a permanent base aboard the Orbiter.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know,\" Spud said. \"Don\u0027t know why, either. Everything was cool just a while ago for Newsbreak. Did you see it?\"\\n\\n MacIntosh shook his head.\\n\\n \"Yeah, you were in your turret. The Tatoosh woman did the show, said something about Ben Ozette missing. That must throw their staffing off or something.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Mack said, \"he\u0027s a little goody-goody for me, but he means well. He\u0027s sure been on the Director\u0027s tail lately.\"\\n\\n Dwarf could see Spud\u0027s frown reflected in one of the dead screens.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a good idea to get on the Director\u0027s tail,\" Spud said. \"Not good at all. If you didn\u0027t see the Newsbreak, then you didn\u0027t see yourself, either.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ascension-factor-destination-void-4/page-10.html","bookId":2172,"book":{"id":2172,"title":"The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4)","description":"Storyline: The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4) \\n As one of three survivours of the orbiting hibernation tanks, a Raja Flattery clone has established himself as \"Director\" of Pandora.
