He had two fingers and a thumb on each hand and she tried to remember which of the old islands carried that trait.\\n\\n Orcas? Camano?\\n\\n He smiled with the gesture, showing teeth that had been filed to horrible points - rumored to be the mark of one of the death squads that called themselves \"the Bite.\"\\n\\n \"Your belongings are already aboard the ferry,\" he said. \"You are famous, so we recognize your needs. You will have the privacy of a stateroom for the crossing and a guard to escort you.\"\\n\\n \"Bu...\"\\n\\n His hand was on her elbow, guiding her out the hatchway.\\n\\n \"We have delayed the ferry while you board,\" he said. \"For the sake of the project, please make haste.\"\\n\\n She was already out in the passageway and he was propelling her toward the ferry\u0027s lower boarding section.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" she said, \"I don\u0027t thin...\"\\n\\n \"You have a task already awaiting you at the launch site,\" the captain said. \"I am to inform you that you will be doing a special Newsbreak there shortly after arrival and before your launch.\"\\n\\n He handed her the messenger that she usually carried at her hip.\\n\\n \"Everything\u0027s in here,\" he said, and grinned.\\n\\n Beatriz felt that he was entirely too happy for her own comfort. Certainly the sight of his teeth gave her no comfort at all. She was curious, in her journalistic way, about the hows and whys of the death squads. Her survival instinct overrode her curiosity. The security escort met them at the gangway. He was short, young and loaded down with several of her equipment bags.\\n\\n \"A pleasure to have met you,\" the captain said, with another slight bow. He handed her a stylus and an envelope. \"If you please, for my wife. She admires you and your show very much.\"\\n\\n \"What is her name?\"\\n\\n \"Anna.\"\\n\\n Beatriz wrote in a hasty hand, \"For Anna, for the future,\" and signed it with the appropriate flourish. The captain nodded his thanks and Beatriz climbed aboard the ferry. She had barely cleared the second lock when she felt it submerge.\\n\\n Worship isn\u0027t really love. An object of worship can never be itself. Remember that people love people, and vice versa. People fear gods.\\n\\n - Dwarf MacIntosh, Kelpmaster, Current Control\\n\\n The early morning light clarified the new drift that Ben\u0027s life had taken. He knew that he would use Crista\u0027s holy image on Shadowbox, much as Flattery had used it on Holovision, to manipulate the people of Pandora. He would use Crista to whip them up against Flattery. He knew that doing this would further bury her humanity, her womanhood. Knowing he would do it cost him something, too. He vowed it would not cost them their love that he already felt filling the space between them. There would be a wa...\\n\\n Damn!\\n\\n Ben had not wanted anything to step between himself and the story he\u0027d set out to get. Now he was the lead story on prime time. He and Crista had watched the Holovision newsbreak the night before in one of the Zavatans\u0027 underground chambers. Though it didn\u0027t surprise him, he found it ironic that Beatriz was taking his place.\\n\\n \"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,\" she began, \"I\u0027m Beatriz Tatoosh, standing in for Ben Ozette, who is on assignment in Sappho. In our headlines this evening, Crista Galli was abducted a few hours ago from her quarters in the Preserve. Eight armed terrorists, thought to be Shadow...\"\\n\\n Maybe she thought she was doing me a favor, he thought.\\n\\n But it was no favor, at least not to Ben. He was not on assignment in Sappho, and there had been no eight armed terrorists. They\u0027d simply walked away. Beatriz read the lines that Flattery\u0027s hired maggot fed her. Wrapped up as she was in the Orbiter and Project Voidship, she probably didn\u0027t know the difference.\\n\\n Ben wondered what was going on in the boardroom of Holovision right now. Holovision was owned by Merman Mercantile, and the Director had acquired control of Merman Mercantile through bribery, manipulation, extortion and assassination. This was the story that Ben had begun to broadcast on Shadowbox. What had started as the biggest story of his life had become an act that would change his life forever, probably change Crista\u0027s life forever and perhaps save the people of Pandora from the Director\u0027s backlash of poverty and hunger.\\n\\n Now Crista was hiding out with him. He had touched her and lived. He had kissed her and lived. Even now, it took great self-control to keep Ben from moving that pale lock of hair out of the corner of her mouth, to keep from caressing her forehead, to keep from slipping underneath the silky cover an...\\n\\n You\u0027re too young to be an old fool, he thought, so stop acting like one. You could be a dead fool.\\n\\n He reflected on the combined coincidence, fate or divine inspiration that had brought them together, at this time, in this cubby, on this world a millennium at light speed from the origins of humans themselves. It had taken thousands of years, travel from star to star, the near-annihilation of humankind to bring Ben and Crista Galli together. Avata, too, had been nearly annihilated, but a few kelp genes were safely tucked away in most Pandoran humans. Perhaps they were all altered for eternity and these stray bits of the genetic code would bring them together at last.\\n\\n Why? he wondered. Why us?\\n\\n This was one of those times when Ben wished for a normal life. He did not want to be the salvation of society, the species, or anybody\u0027s salvation but his own. Things weren\u0027t working out that way, and it was too late now to change that. Now, against his better judgment, he was once again in love with an impossible woman.\\n\\n In the long scheme of things Crista was much more human than Avatan - at least, in appearance. What her kelpness held in check was anyone\u0027s guess, including Crista\u0027s. In theory, it meant she had many complete minds, capable of thinking and acting independently. This had been discovered in one of the Director\u0027s cherished studies. Crista herself had exhibited only one personality during her five years under scrutiny, and it was the one subject that she was reluctant to speak of with Ben.\\n\\n She was alleged to be the daughter of Vata, and Vata was the \"Holy Child\" of the poet/prophet Kerro Panille and Waela TaoLini. Vata had been conceived in a thrash of human limbs and the intrusion of Avatan tendrils and spores inside the cabin of a sabotaged LTA centuries ago. She was born with a total genetic memory and some form of thigmocommunication common to the kelp. She lay comatose for nearly two centuries.\\n\\n The human purported to be Crista\u0027s father, Duque, had Avatan characteristics instilled through his mother\u0027s egg in the labs of the infamous Jesus Lewis, the bioengineer who once wiped out the kelp, body of Avata. He very nearly destroyed humanity along with the kelp. Vata was the beloved saint of Pandora, symbol of the union of humanity with the gods, voice of the gods themselves. Crista Galli, beloved of Ben Ozette, was no less godlike in her power and mystery, in her beauty, in the shadow of death about her. This did not make loving her easy.\\n\\n Ben knew that the kelp - Avata - had been the survival key to humans on Pandora. It was difficult, maybe impossible, for humans to relate to a sentien... kelp. And this new kelp was not the same creature that the pioneers had encountered. Ben had studied The Histories enough to agree with the experts - this kelp was fragmented, it was not the single sentient being of old. Many of the faithful among the people of Pandora claimed that this was why Avata formed Crista Galli, to present itself in an acceptable form. This theory was fast gaining support.\\n\\n Then what does it want?\\n\\n To live!\\n\\n The sudden thought intruded on his mind like a shout, startling him alert. It was a voice he almost recognized. He listened deep inside himself, head tilted, but nothing more came. The sleeper still slept.\\n\\n The kelp, the body of Avata, was responsible for the stability of the very planet itself. One moon had pulverized itself to asteroids while several continents had ripped apart like tissue paper after the kelp was killed off by the bioengineer Jesus Lewis. Now, the kelp was replanted and the land masses returned after a couple of centuries under the sea. Humans were relearning to live on land as well as on or undersea. It pained Ben that people were still just scratching in dirt when they should be thriving.\\n\\n That\u0027s the Director\u0027s fault, he reminded himself, not the kelp\u0027s.\\n\\n The Director refused to recognize publicly the sentience of the kelp and used it simply as a mechanism, a series of powerful switches that controlled worldwide currents and, to some degree, weather. Everyone knew this was getting more difficult daily. There was more kelp daily, and very little of it was hooked up to Current Control.\\n\\n The kelp is resisting Flattery, he thought. When it breaks completely free, I want it to have a conscience.\\n\\n Ben\u0027s diligent research, with a few leads from Crista, uncovered the secret reports and he knew the real depth of Flattery\u0027s interest in what one paper called \"the Avata Phenomenon.\" Ben had spoken with the Zavatans, monks in the hills who used the kelp in their rituals.\\n\\n Crista says the Director should be consulting the kelp! he thought. And I get the same story from those monks.\\n\\n She stirred again, and he knew she would wake soon. She would see the dockside shops fill with vendors and hear the morning calls from the street of: \"Milk! Juices!\" \"Eggs! We have licensed squawk eggs today!\" This was one of the many small pleasures that the Director had denied her - human companionship. Ben knew that he, too, in his way, would deny her this.\\n\\n For now, he reminded himself. Soon, we will have all the time in the world together.\\n\\n From the coffee shop below he could hear the faint scrape of furniture, the metallic clink of utensils and china.\\n\\n Ben Ozette leaned back against the wall and let out a long, slow breath. Though he\u0027d refused to admit it until now, he was surprised to be alive. He\u0027d not only touched the forbidden Crista Galli, but he\u0027d kissed her. It was twelve hours later and he was still breathing. They\u0027d made it through the night without Vashon Security hunting them down. He waited for Crista to wake, for Rico\u0027s code-knock at the door, to see what they would make of the rest of their lives.\\n\\n When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, \"A shower is coming,\" and so it comes to pass. And when you see the south wind blow, you say, \"There will be a scorching heat,\" and so it comes to pass. You hypocrites! you know how to judge the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that you do not judge this time?\\n\\n - Jesus\\n\\n Crista Galli\u0027s first memory of waking up that morning on Kalaloch was of the way the light caught the carved cup in Ben Ozette\u0027s hand, and of his hand. She wanted that hand to touch her, to brush her cheek or rest on her shoulder. It was so still, that hand balancing the cup on his knee, that she lay there for a while wondering whether he had fallen asleep sitting up beside the bed. She shuddered at the thought of sitting in one of those pieces of ghastly Islander furniture, a living creature that they called \"chairdog.\"\\n\\n Kalaloch, too, was waking outside. She heard the stirrings of people and the stutter of engines starting as the dozer and crawler crews headed for another day\u0027s work advancing the perimeter. The hungry and homeless of a dozen grounded islands also woke from their sleep in the gritty folds of greater Kalaloch.\\n\\n Crista listened to the closer, warmer sound of Ben\u0027s quiet breathing.\\n\\n God, she thought, what if I\u0027d killed him?\\n\\n She stifled a giggle, imagining the news lead as Ben himself might have written it: \"Holovision\u0027s popular Nightly News correspondent Ben Ozette was kissed to death last night on assignmen...\" The warmth, the taste of that kiss replayed itself in her mind. This was her first kiss, the one she\u0027d nearly given up on.\\n\\n Ben suffered no ill effects, which she attributed to the action of Flattery\u0027s daily dose of antidote, still in her system. Yet she had received the flood of Ben\u0027s past with the touch of his lips to her own, a cascade of memories, emotions and fear that nearly paralyzed her with its unexpected clarity and force.\\n\\n There were these matters of his life that she preferred not to know: Ben\u0027s first kiss, a pretty redhead; his last kiss, Beatriz Tatoosh. Both of these and more lingered on her own lips. She witnessed his first lovemaking through the memory of his cells, witnessed his birth, the sinking of Guemes Island, the deaths of his parents. His memories impregnated her very cells, waiting for her own emotional trigger that would call them to life.\\n\\n She had received his memories with his kiss, too stunned to tell him. Her dreams that night were his dreams, his memories. She saw Shadowbox as he saw it, as the organ of truth in a body riddled with lies. She knew that he, like herself, was vulnerable and lonely and had a life to live for others. She did not want to keep this from him, the fact that she now owned his life. She did not want to lose him now that they had finally found each other, and she did not want to be the death of him, either.\\n\\n Ben was not afraid of \"the Tingle,\" as people called it - this kelp death that supposedly lurked in her touch as it did in some kelp, within her very chemistry. Sometimes she didn\u0027t believe it, either. Flattery himself had developed the antidote, which he saw to it that she received daily. It did not diminish the chemical messages she received, such as Ben\u0027s memories. It merely muted those that her body might send. Still, none dared touch her and all of her attendants in Flattery\u0027s compound kept her at a safe distance.\\n\\n This was the first morning in her memory that she did not wake up to attendants, endless tests, to the difficult task of being a revered prisoner in the great house of the Director. Crista had slept the refreshing sleep of the newborn in spite of their escape, their hiding, her first kiss. An emptiness rumbled through her stomach as delicious aromas rose to her of pastries, hot breads, coffee.\\n\\n Somewhere beneath them hot sebet sizzled on a grill. Meat was something she craved. Flattery\u0027s labtechs had explained this to her, some mumbo-jumbo about her Avatan genes affecting her protein synthesis, but she knew this simply as hunger. She also hungered for fresh fruits of all kinds, and nuts and grains. The very thought of a salad gagged her and always had.\\n\\n Though they\u0027d fled here in the night, Crista had memorized the warrenlike underground system they took to get from the Director\u0027s complex at the Preserve to this Islander community at Kalaloch. She was reminded of the maze of kelpways down under. She knew nothing of the local geography save that she was near the sea, relieving some other hunger that rumbled within.\\n\\n She heard the sea now, a wet pulse over the babble of street vendors and the increasing traffic of the day. Pandorans were an early lot, she\u0027d heard, but unhurried. It is difficult for the hungry to hurry. Only a very few remained on their traditional organic islands. Drifting the seas had become much too dangerous a life in this day of jagged coastlines and sea lanes choked with kelp. The majority who settled landside still called themselves \"Islander\" and retained their old manners of dress and custom. Those Islanders whom she\u0027d known at the Preserve compound were either servants or security, close-mouthed about their lives outside Flattery\u0027s great basalt walls. Many were horribly mutated, a revulsion to Flattery but a fascination to her.\\n\\n Crista Galli tucked the cover under her chin and stretched backward, unfolding to the sunlight, aware of some new modesty in the company of Ben Ozette. She had all of the intimacies of his life stored in her head, now, and she was afraid of what he might think of her if he knew. She felt herself flush, a bit of a voyeur, as she remembered his first night with Beatriz.\\n\\n Men are so strange, Crista thought. He\u0027d brought her here on the run from Vashon security and the Director, assured her that they were safely hidden in this tiny cubby, then he sat up all night beside her rather than join her in bed. He\u0027d already proven immune to her deadly touch, and she liked the kiss as much as the daring gesture of the kiss.\\n\\n The attentions of other men, the Director among them, had taught her something of the power of her beauty. Ben Ozette was attracted to her, that had been clear the first time she\u0027d looked into his eyes. They were green, something like her own only darker. She treasured the one magic kiss they had shared before she slept. She treasured his memories that now were hers, the family she shared with him, his lover...\\n\\n Her reverie was interrupted by a shriek in the street below, then a long, high-voiced wail that chilled her in spite of her warm bed. She lay quiet while Ben set aside his cup and rose to the window.\\n\\n They\u0027ve found someone, she thought, someone who\u0027s been killed.\\n\\n Ben had told her about the bodies in the streets in the morning, but it was something too far from her life to imagine.\\n\\n \"The death squads leave them for a lesson,\" he said. \"Bodies are there in the mornings for people to see when they go to work, when they take the children to their creche. Some have no hands, some have no tongues or heads. Some are mutilated obscenely. If you stop to look, you are questioned: \u0027Do you know this man? Come with us.\u0027 No one wants to go with them. Sooner or later a wife is notified, or a mother or a son. Then the body is removed.\"\\n\\n Ben had seen hundreds of such bodies in his work, and she had glimpsed these the night before in the speedy unreeling of his memories into her own. This wail she thought must come from a mother who had just found her dead son. Crista was not tempted to look outside. Ben returned to his watch at her bedside.\\n\\n Had he seen anything of her when she kissed him? Such a thing happened sometimes with the kelp, but seldom anymore with herself. It had happened with others who\u0027d touched her. First, the shock of wide-eyed disbelief; then, the unfocused eyes and the trembling; at last, the waking and the registry of stark terror. For those who had been lucky enough to wake.\\n\\n What did I show them? she wondered. Why some and not all? She had studied the kelp\u0027s history and found no help there, precious little comfort. She still smoldered over some research tech\u0027s pointed reference to her \"family tree.\"\\n\\n She remembered how she had been kept alive down under by the cilia of the kelp that probed the recesses of her body. She received the ministrations of the mysterious, nearly mythological Swimmers, the severest of human mutations. Adapted completely to water, Swimmers resembled giant, gilled salamanders more than humans. They occupied caves, Oracles, abandoned Merman outposts and some kelp lagoons. She had been one with the kelp, more kelp than human, for her first nineteen years. There were some of Flattery\u0027s people who thought that she had been manufactured by the kelp, but she herself believed that couldn\u0027t be true.\\n\\n A lot of other Pandorans sported the green-eyed gene of the kelp, including Ben. At a little over a meter and a half tall she could look over the heads of most women and looked most men nearly in the eye. Her surface network of blue veins was slightly more visible than other people\u0027s because she was nearly pale enough to be translucent. The blood in her veins was red, based on iron, and incontrovertibly human - facts that had been established her first day out of the kelp.\\n\\n Her full lips puckered slightly when she was thinking, hanging on the edge of a kiss. Her straight, slender nose flared slightly at the nostrils and flared even more when she was angry - another emotion she dared not indulge among Flattery\u0027s people.\\n\\n Crista had been educated by the touch of the kelp, which infused in her certain genetic memories of the humans that it had encountered. Before Flattery took power, most humans contacted the kelp by being buried at sea. She had to shut out the flood of memories that came rolling in with the sounds of the nearby waves. She treated herself to another languorous stretch then turned to Ben.\\n\\n \"Did you sit up all night?\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t sleep anyway,\" he said.\\n\\n He stood slowly, working out the kinks in his body, then sat on the edge of her bed.\\n\\n Crista sat up and leaned against his shoulder. The disturbance below their window was gone. They faced the plaz, the morning sunlight off the bay, and Crista was lulled into a half-sleep by the warmth from the window, the coziness of Ozette beside her, and the harmonious chatter of the street vendors. In the distance she heard the heavy machinery of construction tear into the hills.\\n\\n \"Will we leave here soon?\" she asked. She was invigorated by the sunlight, the plop-plop-plop of waves against the bulkhead and a whiff of broiling sebet on the air. The years of lies and imprisonment at the hands of the Director washed through her like a current of cold blood. Every morning that she had awakened in his compound she simply wanted to curl up under those covers and doze. Today, wherever Ben Ozette was going, Crista was going with him.\\n\\n Someone whistled at their hatch, a short musical phrase, repeated once. It was the same kind of whistle-language that she\u0027d heard from dockside the night before.\\n\\n Ozette grunted, rapped twice on the deck. A single whistle replied.\\n\\n \"Our people,\" he said. \"They will move us this morning, much as I\u0027d like to show you the neighborhood. Rico is setting it up. The whole world knows by now that you\u0027re gone. The reward for your return, and for my head, will be enough to tempt even good peopl... on either side. There is much hunger.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t go back there,\" she said. \"I won\u0027t. I have seen the sky. You kissed m...\"\\n\\n He smiled at her, offered her a drink of his water. But he did not kiss her.\\n\\n She knew that he would be killed if caught, that Flattery had already signed his death warrant. The Warrior\u0027s Union would take care of it, had probably already taken care of every servant and selected others at the Preserve.\\n\\n The night before, emerging from the underground, they had dodged from building to building along the waterfront streets, fearful of security patrols enforcing Flattery\u0027s curfew. Crista had stopped in the open to look at the stars and at Pandora\u0027s nearer moons. She bathed firsthand in the touch of a cool breeze on her face and arms, smelled the charcoal cookery of the poor, saw the stars with only the atmosphere in her way.\\n\\n \"I want to go outside,\" she whispered. \"Can we go out soon, to the street?\"\\n\\n Always the answer from the Director had been no. It was always no. \"The demons,\" they would say at first, \"you would hardly make a meal for them.\" Or, later, \"The Shadows want you killed,\" the Director would say. Lately, he had repeated, \"You can\u0027t tell - the swine could look like anyone. It would be horrible if they got their hooks into you.\"\\n\\n The Director had a particular leer that gave her the creeps, though to hear him tell it there was no one who could protect her but him, no one she could trust in the world but him. For most of that five years she had believed him. Shadowbox changed all that. Then Ben Ozette came to do his story, and she realized that the only reason Flattery forbade her touch was his fear that she would learn something from him, from his people, and expose his intricate system of lies.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Ben said. \"We\u0027ll get out soon. Things are going to get very hot here very soo...\"\\n\\n He stiffened suddenly and swore under his breath. He pointed at a Vashon security patrol working their way down the pierside toward them: two men on each side of the street. They poured an insidious stillness over a choppy sea of commuters and shoppers in the marketplace. The press of commuters crowding toward the ferries parted for them without touching.\\n\\n Each guard carried a small lasgun slung under one arm, and from each belt hung various tools of the security trade: coup baton for infighting hand to hand, charges for the lasguns, a fistful of small but efficient devices of chemical and mechanical restraint. They each wore a pair of mirrored sunglasses - trademark of the Warrior\u0027s Union, the Director\u0027s personal assassination squad. Among the people there was much smiling, headshaking, shoulder-shrugging; some cringed.\\n\\n Crista watched the pair work their way along the dockside street and felt the small hairs rise on her arms and the back of her neck.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Ben said, as though reading her mind. With his hand on her bare shoulder like that she believed it was possible that he was reading her mind - or, at least, her emotions. She loved his touch. She felt a new flood of his life enter through her skin. It stored itself somewhere in her brain while her eyes went on watching the street.\\n\\n The security team left one man in front of each building in turn while the other searched inside. They were close.\\n\\n \"What do we do?\" she asked.\\n\\n He reached to the other side of the bed for a bundle of Islander clothes and set them in her lap.\\n\\n \"Get dressed,\" he said, \"and watch. Stay back from the plaz.\"\\n\\n There was a sudden, concussive whump and a flash of orange from the harbor, then a roil of black smoke. The street turned into a scramble of bodies as people ran to their boats dockside and to their firefighting stations. Pandorans had used hydrogen for their engines and stoves, their welding torches and power production since the old days. Hydrogen storage tanks were everywhere, and fire one of their great fears.\\n\\n \"Wha... ?\"\\n\\n \"An old coracle,\" Ben said, \"registered to me. They will be busy for a while. With luck, they will believe we were aboard.\"\\n\\n Another whump took Crista\u0027s breath away, and as she pulled on the unfamiliar clothing she saw that the security squad had not disappeared with the crowd. They came on with the same precision and deliberation, door to door. The street was nearly empty as everyone else who was able-bodied fought the fires or moved nearby boats to safety.\\n\\n While Ben stood watch beside the window, Crista pulled on a heavily embroidered white cotton dress that was much too big for her. Her breasts, though not small, bobbled free inside. She held the fabric away from her flat belly and looked questioningly at Ben.\\n\\n He tossed her a black pajama-type worksuit of the Islanders that appeared identical to the one he wore. From a drawer beside the bed he pulled a long woven sash and handed it to her.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know how to tell you this, but you\u0027re pregnant. Quite a ways along, too.\"\\n\\n When she still didn\u0027t follow his intent, he said, \"Strap the worksuit on your belly to fill out the dress,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll need it later. For now, you are a pregnant Islander. I am your man.\"\\n\\n She strapped the worksuit around her as instructed and adjusted the dress. In the mirror beside the hatch she did look pregnant.\\n\\n Crista watched in the mirror as Ben wrapped a long red bandana around his head, letting the tails fall between his shoulder blades. It was embroidered with the same geometries that appeared on her dress.\\n\\n My man, she thought with a smile, and we\u0027re dressing to go out.\\n\\n She patted the padding on her stomach fondly and rested her hand there, half-expecting to feel some tiny movement. Ben stood behind her and tied a similar bandana around her forehead. He gave her a floppy straw hat to wear over it.\\n\\n \"This manner of dress is the mark of the Island I grew up on,\" he said. \"You have heard about Guemes Island?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, of course. Sunk the year before I was born.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"You are now the pregnant wife of a Guemes Island survivor. Among Islanders you will receive the greatest respect. Among Mermen you will be treated with the deference that only the guilty can bestow. As you know, it means absolutely nothing among Flattery\u0027s people. We have no papers, there wasn\u0027t tim...\"\\n\\n Two whistles at their hatch. Two different whistles.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s Rico,\" he said, and matched her smile. \"Now we get to go outside.\"\\n\\n The things that people want and the things that are good for them are very different... Great art and domestic bliss are mutually incompatible. Sooner or later, you\u0027ll have to make your choice.\\n\\n - Arthur C. Clarke\\n\\n Beatriz dozed awhile on the couch after shutting off her alarm. The dark, plazless office at the launch site helped keep the fabric of her dream alive. Freed from the confines of her mind, it flowed about the room with the ease of a ghost. In a way, it was a ghost.\\n\\n She had been dreaming of Ben, of their last night together, and there were parts of the dream that she wanted to savor. It was two years ago, the night before she made her first trip up to the Orbiter, before she met Mack. She was nervous about her first shuttle flight to the Orbiter, and Ben was going off to the High Reaches to meet with some Zavatan elder. In spite of the fact that they\u0027d been lovers for years, they both felt awkward. It was ending, they knew it was ending, but neither of them could talk about it.\\n\\n It was early evening, clear and warm. A shot of sunset still streaked the horizon pink and blue. They sat aboard one of Holovision\u0027s foils at dockside, in the crew\u0027s quarters. She remembered the familiar shlup-shlip of water against the hull and the occasional mutter of wild squawks settling down. Children played their evening games before being called in for the night and they whistle-signaled from pier to pier. She and Ben had talked of children, of wanting them and of bad timing. This night the rest of their crews had discreetly left them alone. She found out later it was at Rico\u0027s suggestion.\\n\\n \"Women are the answer,\" Ben said, handing her a glass of white wine.\\n\\n \"And what was the question?\"\\n\\n She touched glasses with him, sipped, and set it down. She did not want to ride a rocket into orbit in the morning with a hangover.\\n\\n Ben\u0027s green eyes looked particularly beautiful against his dark skin. His lean, muscular body had always been perfect with hers. She couldn\u0027t understand why he had to go off on his wild projects chasing down Shadows when he could stay and work with her.
