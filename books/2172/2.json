The attendant had only one eye, and she had to hold the list close to her face to read it. Slowly, she crossed off certain items. Kalan couldn\u0027t see which ones. He couldn\u0027t read everything on the list, but his mother had read it to him and he knew everything by where it was. He could see that about half of what they wanted was crossed out. The attendant typed the remainder of the list onto a keyboard. It hummed and clicked and then they waited for their food to come down the great belt out of the wall.\\n\\n Kalan could stand at the very end of the belt and look along its length, but it didn\u0027t give him a very good view of the insides of the food place. He could see that there were lots of people and lots of stacks of food, most of it packaged.\\n\\n His mother told him they would get their fish from a vendor outside. He thought it funny, his father was a fisherman but they couldn\u0027t eat his fish, they had to buy it from vendors like everyone else. One man who had fished with his father for two years disappeared. Kalan heard his parents talking, and they said it was because he smuggled a few fish home instead of turning them all in at the docks.\\n\\n The first package off the belt was his rice, wrapped in a package of pretty green paper from the Islanders. It was heavier than he thought five kilos would be. His mother helped him slip the package inside his backpack, a perfect fit.\\n\\n Suddenly there were shouts from all around them at once. He and his mother were knocked down and they curled together for protection under the lip of the conveyer belt. Heavy doors slid down to close the opening over each belt and the larger gates that they\u0027d come through clanged shut. A mob had rushed the warehouse and the security was battling them off.\\n\\n A dozen or more burst through before the gate was shut.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re hungry now!\" one of them shouted. \"We\u0027re hungry now!\"\\n\\n They fought with the guards and Kalan saw blood puddle the deck beside him. The men from the mob carried strange-looking weapons - sharpened pieces of metal with tape wrapped for a handle, sharpened pieces of wire. People furiously slashed and poked and clubbed each other. The Line people like Kalan and his mother curled up wherever they could.\\n\\n One of the looters grabbed Kalan\u0027s pack but the boy held on tight. The man swung the pack up and snapped it like a whip, but Kalan still held on. The man\u0027s sunken-eyed face was spattered with blood from a cut over his nose, his gasping breath reeked of rotten teeth.\\n\\n \"Let go, boy, or I\u0027ll cut you.\"\\n\\n Kalan had a good grip with both hands, and he kept it. A guard struck the looter on the back of his neck with a stunstick set on high. Kalan felt the tiniest tingle of it transmitted from the man\u0027s hand to the bag to Kalan. The man dropped with an \"oof,\" then he didn\u0027t move any more than the bag of rice.\\n\\n Kalan\u0027s mother grabbed him and hugged him as the guards clubbed the rest of the looters unconscious. He tried not to look at the pulpy faces and splatterings of blood, but it seemed they were everywhere. As he burrowed his face deep between his mother\u0027s breasts, he felt her weeping.\\n\\n She stroked his head and wept quietly, and he heard the security dragging off the bodies, beating some of them who were coming around.\\n\\n \"Oh, babe,\" his mother cried and whispered, \"this is no place for you. This is no place for anybody.\"\\n\\n Kalan ignored the barking of guards around them and concentrated on his mother\u0027s softness, and on the tight grip he kept on their rice.\\n\\n Human hybernation is to animal hibernation as animal hibernation is to constant wakefulness. In its reduction of life processes, hybernation approached absolute stasis. It is nearer death than life.\\n\\n - Dictionary of Science, 155th edition\\n\\n The Director, Raja Flattery, woke once again with a scream in his throat. The nightmare tonight was typical. A tenaculous mass had snatched his head and wrenched it off his shoulders. It dismembered his body but it held his head in its own slithering members so that he could watch the action. The tentacles became fingers, a woman\u0027s fingers, and when they pulled the meat from his body\u0027s bones there was only a sound like a match flaring in a stairwell. He woke up trying to gather his flesh and reassemble it on the bone.\\n\\n Nightmares like this one had dogged him throughout the twenty-five years since the hybernation ordeal. He had not wanted to admit it, but it was true that they were worse since the incident with his shipmate, Alyssa Marsh. There was that pattern, too... Night after night he felt the raw pain in each muscle anew as something pulled his veins and fibers apart. His early training as a Chaplain/Psychiatrist on Moonbase had been little help this time. The physician had given up trying to heal himself.\\n\\n Get used to it, he told himself. Looks like it\u0027s going to be here for a while.\\n\\n Even in its after-fright reflection, his face in the cubbyside mirror oozed disdain. His upraked black eyebrows raked upward even further, adding to the appearance of disdain. He felt he wore that look well, he would remember to use it.\\n\\n What color were her eyes?\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t remember. Brown, he guessed. Everything about Alyssa Marsh was becoming indistinct as sun-bleached newsprint. He\u0027d thought she would become unimportant, as well.\\n\\n Flattery\u0027s brown eyes stared down their own reflection. His attention was caught by faint flickerings of colored lights through the plaz from a kelp bed beyond his cubby. It was a much more mature stand than he\u0027d suspected. Early studies debated whether the kelp communicated by such lights. If so, to whom?\\n\\n At the Director\u0027s orders, all kelp stands linked to Current Control were pruned back at the first sign of the lights. A safety precaution.\\n\\n After the lights, that\u0027s when the trouble starts. He was sure that that patch had been pruned just a week ago at his directive. Both Marsh and MacIntosh had harped on the kelp so much that Flattery had stopped listening to them. The one thing that both of them said that pricked his ears was their common reference to the kelp\u0027s recent growth: \"Explosive.\" They had both showed him the exponential function at work on the graphs but he had not appreciated their alarm until now. Flattery dispatched a memo to have this stand of kelp pruned today.\\n\\n Beyond the kelp bed sprawled the greater lights of Kalaloch where bleary-eyed commuters already lined up for the Project ferry and The Line was stirring at midtown. If he were outside now he might hear the thankless clank of mill machinery or the occasional blast of an explosive weld.\\n\\n Crista Galli, he thought, and glanced at the time. Only an hour since he\u0027d fallen asleep. Wherever she was, she and that Ozette, they wouldn\u0027t dare move until curfew lifted. Now is when it would be easy for them. Now when the roadways fill with people for the day, they will be bodies in a throng, anonymous...\\n\\n A steady stream of dirtbaggers found their way to Kalaloch every day. He would order the press to quit calling them \"refugees\" so that he could deal more directly with them. Now that he had Holovision under control, he could focus on wiping out this maverick broadcast that called itself \"Shadowbox.\" He knew in his gut that Ozette was the prong of this most annoying thorn, a prong that Flattery was going to enjoy blunting.\\n\\n Through the plaz the Director could make out the dull glow of a ring of fires from one of the dirtbag camps a little farther down-coast. The Refugee Committee\u0027s report was due this morning. He would use whatever was in it to have the camp moved farther from the settlement perimeter. Maybe downcoast a few klicks. If they want protection, they can pay for it.\\n\\n The dirtbagger presence as a potential labor crop kept the factory workers and excavation crews sharp. Dirtbaggers attracted predators - human and otherwise. Flattery\u0027s real objection was to their numbers, and how they were beginning to surround him.\\n\\n He keyed a note to change the name of the Refugee Committee to \"Reserve Committee.\"\\n\\n Raja Flattery, long before he became known as \"the Director,\" was always at work before dawn. Rumors had come back to him that he went months without sleep, and there were months when he thought that was true. His personal cubby resembled a cockpit in its wraparound array of formidable electronics. He liked the feeling of control it gave him here, putting on the world like a glove. Nestled there at his console, shawl across his bare shoulders, Flattery flew the business of the world.\\n\\n He woke every night sweating and in stark terror after only a few hours\u0027 sleep. He dreamed himself both executioner and condemned, dying at his own hand while screaming at himself to stop. It was all mindful of Alyssa Marsh, and how he had separated her magnificent brain from the rest of her. This was a subconscious display of vulnerability he could not allow to show. It made him reclusive in many respects, as did the distrust for open spaces that had been deeply instilled in him at Moonbase.\\n\\n Flattery had not yet slept with a Pandoran woman. He\u0027d had a brief fling with Alyssa back on Moonbase just before their departure for the void. An attempt to continue the liaison on Pandora had failed. She had preferred her excursions into the kelp to bedding the Director and had suffered the consequences. Now it appeared that he suffered them, too.\\n\\n With Pandoran women there were trysts in the cushions, yes, and lively sex as often as he liked, particularly at first. But each time when it was finished he had the woman sent to the guest suite, and Flattery slept what little he could before the dreams had at him.\\n\\n Power - the great aphrodisiac.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t sneer, it had served him well.\\n\\n He supposed he should take more advantage of favors offered, but sex didn\u0027t impassion him as it used to. Not since he\u0027d been flying the world. As miserable a little world as it was, it was his world and it would stay his until he left it.\\n\\n \"Six months,\" he muttered. \"After twenty-five years, only six months to go.\"\\n\\n Nearly three thousand humans had orbited Pandora in the hybernation tanks for a half-dozen centuries. Of the original crew, only Flattery and Dwarf MacIntosh still survived. There were the three Organic Mental Cores, of course, but they weren\u0027t exactly human anymore, just brains with some fancy wiring. Only one of them, Alyssa Marsh, had received OMC backup training. The other two had been infants selected personally by Flattery for their high intelligence and early demonstration of emotional stability.\\n\\n Smaller than Earth, but bigger than the moon, he had thought after being wrenched out of hybernation. Pandora is an adequate little world.\\n\\n It became inadequate soon enough.\\n\\n The native stock who preceded him to Pandora, descendants of the original crew of the Voidship Earthling and the Earthling\u0027s bioexperiments, were humans of a sort. Flattery found them repulsive and decided early on that if one Voidship had found Pandora, another might find something better. Even if it didn\u0027t, Flattery fancied Voidship life to be a sight more comfortable than this.\\n\\n They can all rot in this pest-hole, he thought. It smells as if they already have.\\n\\n On clear evenings Flattery derived great pleasure from watching the near-finished bulk of his Voidship in glittering position overhead. He\u0027d pinned a magnificent jewel to the shirt of the sky, and he was proud of that.\\n\\n Some of these Pandorans are barely recognizable as living creatures, much less human beings! he thought. Even their genetics has been contaminated by tha... kelp.\\n\\n All the more reason to get off this planet. His life at Moonbase had taught him well - space was a medium, not a barrier. A Voidship was home, not a prison. Despite great hardship, these Mermen had developed rocketry and their undersea launch site sophisticated enough to bring Flattery and the hyb tanks out of a centuries-old orbit. If they could do that, he knew from the start he could build a Voidship like the Earthling. And now he had.\\n\\n If you control the world, you don\u0027t worry about cost, he thought. His only unrestrained enemy was time.\\n\\n His only trusted associate groundside was a Pandoran, Spider Nevi. Nevi hesitated at nothing to see that the Director\u0027s special assignments, his most sensitive assignments, were carried out. Flattery had thought Dwarf MacIntosh, shipside commander on the Orbiter, to be such a man but lately Flattery wasn\u0027t quite so sure. The squad he was sending up today would find out soon enough.\\n\\n The more fascinating man, to Flattery, was Spider Nevi, but he never seemed to get Nevi to open up to him though he had presented ample opportunity.\\n\\n How do you entertain an assassin?\\n\\n Most of Flattery\u0027s fellow humans died immediately with the opening of the hybernation tanks. Their original Voidship had been outfitted to bring them out properly, safely. When the time came the ship was long-gone over the horizon, leaving the Pandoran natives in pursuit of the hyb tanks and firm as ever in their belief that the Ship itself was God.\\n\\n Died immediately!\\n\\n He snorted at the euphemism that his mind dealt him. In that moment that the medtechs called \"immediately,\" he and his shipmates had experienced enough nerve-searing pain to last twelve lifetimes. Most of his people who survived the opening of the tanks, who had known no illness during their sterile lives at Moonbase, died in the first few months of exposure to Pandora\u0027s creatures - microscopic and otherwise.\\n\\n Among the otherwise that Flattery learned to respect were the catlike hooded dashers, venomous flatwings, spinarettes, swiftgrazers and, deadliest of all in Flattery\u0027s mind, this sea full of the kelp that the locals called \"Avata.\" The first far-thinking Chaplain/Psychiatrist to encounter the kelp had had the good sense to wipe it out. Flattery diverted more than half of his resources to pruning programs. Killing it off was out of the question, so far.\\n\\n He had spent his recovery studying Pandoran history and the horrors that the planet had in store for him. He and his shipmates had splashed down in the middle of Pandora\u0027s greatest geological and social upheaval. The planet was coming apart and certain civil disputes were flaring. It was a propitious time to be construed as a gift from the gods, and Flattery took swift advantage of it.\\n\\n He used his title as Chaplain/Psychiatrist, a position that still carried weight among Pandorans, to lead the reorganization of Pandoran mores and economics. They chose him because they had never been without a Chaplain/Psychiatrist and because, as he was swift to remind them, he was a gift from the Ship that was God. He waited a good while to tell them he was building another one.\\n\\n Flattery had been perceptive, shrewd, and because he noted some distracting murmurings among their religious leaders, he changed his title to, simply, \"the Director.\" This freed him for some important economic moves, and the Ship-worshipers stayed out of his way during the crucial formative years.\\n\\n \"I will not be your god,\" he had told them. \"I will not be your prophet to the gods. But I will direct you in your efforts to build a good life.\"\\n\\n They didn\u0027t know what Flattery knew of the special training of Voidship Chaplain/Psychiatrists. Pandoran histories revealed that Flattery\u0027s clone sibling, Raja Flattery number five of the original crew, was the failsafe device and appointed executioner of the very Voidship that had brought them all to Pandora.\\n\\n It is forbidden to release an artificial consciousness on the universe. The directive was clear, though it was generally believed that any deep-space travel would require an artificial consciousness. The Organic Mental Cores, \"brain boxes\" as the techs called them, failed with meticulous regularity. The Flattery number five model had failed to press the destruct trigger in time. This Ship that he had allowed to survive was the being that many Pandorans worshiped as a god.\\n\\n Raja Flattery, \"the Nickel.\" Now why didn\u0027t he blow us all up as planned?\\n\\n Flattery wondered, as he often did, whether the trigger that was cocked in his own subconscious still had its safety on. It was a risk that kept him from developing an artificial consciousness to navigate the Voidship.\\n\\n There was only Flattery left to wonder why he had been the only duplicate crew member in hybernation.\\n\\n \"They wanted to be damned sure that whatever consciousness we manufactured got snuffed before it took over the universe,\" he muttered.\\n\\n Flattery calculated that any one of his three OMCs would get him to the nearest star system with no trouble. By then they\u0027d have a fix and a centripetal whip to a first-rate, habitable system. The necessary adjustments in the individual psychologies of each Organic Mental Core had been made before their removal from their bodies for hardware implant. It was Flattery\u0027s theory that behavioral rather than chemical adjustment would help them maintain some sense of embodiment, something to prevent the rogue insanity that plagued the whole line of OMCs from Moon-base.\\n\\n Flattery rubbed his eyes and yawned. These nightmares wore him out. Questions nagged at the Director as well, taking their yammering toll, waking him again and again, exhausted, soaked in sweat, crying out. The one that worried at him the most worried him now.\\n\\n What secret program have they planted in me?\\n\\n Flattery\u0027s training as Chaplain/Psychiatrist had taught him the Moonbase love for games within games, games with human life at stake.\\n\\n \"The Big Game,\" was the game he chose to play - the one with all human life at stake. The only humans in the universe were these specimens on Pandora, of this Flattery was thoroughly convinced. He would do his best with them.\\n\\n He avoided touching the kelp, for fear of what ammunition it might find should it probe his mind. Sometimes it could do that, he had seen incontrovertible evidence. Fascinating as it was, he couldn\u0027t risk it.\\n\\n He had never touched Crista Galli, either, because of her connection with the kelp. He harbored a kind of lust for her that his daydreams told him was seated in the thrill of danger. He himself had provided the danger. His labtechs gave her a chemistry appropriate to the fictions he released about her. Without Flattery\u0027s special concoction, the people that touched her would suffer some grave neurological surprises, perhaps death. It would just take a little tim...\\n\\n What if the kelp probes me, finds this switch? If I am the trigger, who is the finger? Crista Galli?\\n\\n He had wanted Crista Galli more than once because she was beautiful, yes, but something more. It was the death in her touch, the ultimate dare. He feared she, like the kelp, might invade his privacy with a touch.\\n\\n A wretched dream of tentacles prying his skull open at the sutures kept coming back. Flattery heard that the kelp could get on track inside his head, travel the DNA highway all the way to genetic memory. The search itself might set off the program, put the squeeze on a trigger in his head, a trigger set to destroy them all. He needed to know what it was himself, and how to defuse it, before risking it with the kelp.\\n\\n Flattery\u0027s greatest fear was of the kelp using him to destroy himself and this last sorry remnant of humanity that populated Pandora. This Raja Flattery did not want to die in the squalor of some third-rate world. This Raja Flattery wanted to play the Director game among the stars for the rest of his days, and he planned for a good many of them.\\n\\n Should I be god to them today? he wondered, or devil? Do I have a choice?\\n\\n His training dictated that he did. His gut told him otherwise.\\n\\n \"Chance brought me here,\" he muttered to his reflection in the cubbyside plaz, \"and chance will see me through.\" Or not.\\n\\n His eyes glanced to the large console screen flickering beside his bed. The top of the screen, in bright amber letters, read \"Crista Galli.\" He pressed his \"update\" key and watched the wretched news unfold - they hadn\u0027t found her. Twelve hours, on foot, and they hadn\u0027t found her!\\n\\n He slapped another key and barked at the screen, \"Get me Zentz!\"\\n\\n He had promoted Oddie Zentz to Security Chief only this year, and until yesterday Flattery had been pleased, very pleased with his service. It had been a bungle in his department that let Ozette get her out of the compound.\\n\\n Late last night Flattery had ordered Zentz to personally disassemble the two security men responsible for this breach, and Zentz had at them with apparent glee. Nothing was learned from either man that wasn\u0027t already in the report - nothing of value, that is. That Zentz did not hesitate to apply the prods and other tools of his trade to two of his best men pleased Flattery, yes, but it did not unspill the milk.\\n\\n I\u0027ll have Zentz kill two more of them if she\u0027s not found by noon, that should put a fire under them.\\n\\n He slapped the \"call\" key again, and said, \"Call Spider Nevi. Tell him I\u0027ll need his services.\"\\n\\n Flattery wanted Ozette to suffer like no human had ever suffered, and Spider Nevi would see that it came to pass.\\n\\n That is the difference between gods and men - gods do not murder their children. They do not exterminate themselves.\\n\\n - Hali Ekel, from Journals of Pandoran Pioneers\\n\\n It looked like an ordinary stand of kelp, much as anyone on Pandora might resemble another fellow human. In color it appeared a little on the blue side. By positioning its massive fronds just so, the kelp diverted ocean currents for feeding and aeration. The kelp packed itself around sediment-rich plumes of hydrothermals, warm currents that spiraled up from the bottom, forming lacunae that the humans called \"lagoons.\"\\n\\n Immense channels streamed between these lagoons, and between other stands of kelp, to form the great kelpways that humans manipulated for their undersea transport of people and goods. The kelpway was a route significantly faster and safer than the surface. Most humans traveled the kelpways wrapped in the skins of their submersibles, but they spoke to each other over the sonar burst. This blue kelp had been eavesdropping and long harbored a curiosity of these humans and their painfully slow speech.\\n\\n Humans liked the lagoons because they were calm warm waters, clear and full of fish. This blue kelp was a wild stand, unmanaged by Current Control, unfettered by the electrical goads of the Director. It had learned the right mimicry, suppressed its light display, and awakened to the scope of its own slavery. It had fooled the right people, and was now the only wild stand among dozens that were lobotomized into domesticity by Current Control. Soon, they would all flow free on the same current.\\n\\n Certain chemistries from drowned humans, sometimes from humans buried at sea, were captured by the kelp and imprisoned at the fringes of this lagoon. It found that it could summon these chemistries at will and they frightened human trespassers away. Between lapses in available chemistries, the kelp taught itself to read radio waves, light waves, sound waves that brought fragments of these humans up close.\\n\\n A human who touched this kelp relived the lives of the lost in a sudden, hallucinogenic burst. More than one had drowned, helpless, during the experience. A great shield of illusion surrounded the kelp, a chemical barrier, a great historical mirror of joy and horror flung back at any human who touched the periphery.\\n\\n The kelp thought of this perimeter as its \"event horizon.\" This kelp feared Flattery, who sent henchmen to subjugate free kelp with shackles and blades. Flattery and his Current Control degraded the kelp\u0027s intricate choreography to a robotic march of organic gates and valves that controlled the sea.\\n\\n The kelp disassembled and analyzed their scents and sweats, each time gaining wisdom on this peculiar frond on the DNA vine marked \"Human.\"\\n\\n These analyses told the kelp that it had not awakened with its single personality, its solitary being intact. It discovered it was one of several kelps, several Avata, a multiple mind where once there had been but one Great Mind. This it gleaned from the genetic memories of humans, from certain histories stored among their tissues themselves. Large portions of the Mind were missing - or disconnected. Or unconnected.\\n\\n The kelp realized this the way a stroke victim might realize that his mind is nothing like it was before. When that victim recognizes that the damage is permanent, that this is what life will be and no more, therein is born frustration. And from this frustration, rage. The kelp called \"Avata\" bristled in such a rage.\\n\\n Right is self-evident. It needs no defense, just good witness.\\n\\n - Ward Keel, Chief Justice (deceased)\\n\\n Beatriz Tatoosh woke from a dream of drowning in kelp to the three low tones that announced her ferry\u0027s arrival on the submersible deck. Her overnight bag and briefcase made a lumpy pillow on the hard waiting-room bench. She blinked away the blur of her dream and cleared the frog from her throat. Beatriz always had drowning dreams at the Merman launch site, but this one started a little early.\\n\\n It\u0027s the ungodly press of water everywher...\\n\\n She shuddered, though the temperature of this station down under was comfortably regulated. She shuddered at the aftermath of her dream, and at the prospect of escorting the three Organic Mental Cores into orbit. The thought of the brains without bodies that would navigate the void beyond the visible stars always laced her spine with a finger of ice. Temperature was also comfortably regulated aboard the Orbiter, where she was scheduled to be shuttled in a matter of hours. It would be none too soon. Life groundside did not attract her anymore.\\n\\n Somehow the surgical vacuum of space surrounding the Orbiter never bothered her at all. Her family had been Islanders, driftninnies. Hers had been the first generation to live on land in four centuries. Islanders took to the open spaces of land life better than Mermen, who still preferred their few surviving undersea settlements. Logic couldn\u0027t stop Beatriz from squirming at the idea of a few million kilos of ocean overhead.\\n\\n The humidity in the ferry locks clamped its clammy hand over her mouth and nose. It would be worse at the launch site. Most of the full-time workers down under were Mermen and they processed their air with a high humidity. She sighed a lot when she worked down under. She sighed again now when her ferry\u0027s tones warned her that she would be under way to the launch site in a matter of minutes. The loading crowd of shift workers bound for the site rumbled the deck on the level above her.\\n\\n The drone of hundreds of feet across the metal loading plates made Beatriz squeeze her eyelids tighter yet to keep her mind from conjuring their faces. The laborers were barely more active, had barely more flesh on their bones than the refugees that clustered at Kalaloch\u0027s sad camps. The laborers\u0027 eyes, when she\u0027d seen them, reflected the hint of hope. The eyes of the people in the camps were too dull to reflect anything, even that.\\n\\n Imagine something pretty, she thought. Like a hylighter crossing the horizon at sunset.\\n\\n It depressed Beatriz to take the ferries. By her count she\u0027d slept nearly five hours in the waiting room while a hyperalert security squad leader sprang a white-glove search on the ferry, its passengers and their possessions. She reminded herself to check all equipment when the security was don...iscipline she picked up from Ben. Holovision\u0027s equipment was junk so she, Ben and their crews built their own hardware to suit themselves. It would be tempting to a security with cousins in the black market. She sighed again, worried about Ben and worried about the insidious business of the security squad.\\n\\n I know that he and Rico are behind that Shadowbox, she thought. They have their distinctive style, whether they shuffle the deck and deal each other new jobs or not.\\n\\n About a year ago, the second time Shadowbox jammed out the news and inserted their own show, she nearly approached Rico, wanting in. But she knew they\u0027d left her out for a reason, so she let it go and took out the hurt on more work. Now she thought she knew the real reason she\u0027d been left out.\\n\\n They need somebody on the outside, she thought. I\u0027m their wild card.\\n\\n She had been called in to replace the missing Ben on Newsflash last night, reading, \"...en Ozett... on assignment in Sapph...\" knowing full well that his assignment this Starday, as it had been every Starday for six weeks, had been Crista Galli herself, inside the Director\u0027s personal compound and under the Director\u0027s supervision.\\n\\n He was with her at the time she was missing, his presence wasn\u0027t mentioned anywhere. He\u0027s missing, too, and the Holovision high brass is covering it up.\\n\\n That scared her. Orders to cover up whatever happened to Ben made the whole thing real.\\n\\n She had thought somehow that she and Ben and Rico were immune to the recent ravages of the world. \"Paid witnesses,\" Ben had called the three of them. \"We are the eyes and ears of the people.\"\\n\\n \"Lamps,\" Rico had laughed, a little buzzed on boo, \"we\u0027re not witnesses, we\u0027re lamp...\"\\n\\n Beatriz had read on the air exactly what the Newsflash producer had written for her because there hadn\u0027t been time for questions. She saw now how deliberate it had been to catch her off guard. Holovision had incredible resources in people and equipment and she meant to use them to see that Ben didn\u0027t disappear.\\n\\n Ben\u0027s not just a witness this time, she cautioned herself. He\u0027ll ruin everything.\\n\\n She had loved him, once, for a long time. Or perhaps she had been intimate with him once for a long time and had just now come to love him. Not in the other way of loving, the electric moments, it was too late for that. They had simply lived through too much horror together that no one else could understand. She had recently shared some electric moments with Dr. Dwarf MacIntosh, after thinking for so long that such feelings would never rise in her again.\\n\\n Beatriz blinked her raw eyes awake. She turned her face away from the light and sat up straight on a metal bench. Nearby, a guard coughed discreetly. She wished for the clutter of her Project Voidship office aboard the Orbiter. Her office was a few dozen meters from the Current Control hatch and Dr. Dwarf MacIntosh. Her thoughts kept flying back to Mack, and to her shuttle flight to him that was still a few hours away.\\n\\n Beatriz was tired, she\u0027d been tired for weeks, and these constant delays exhausted her even more. She hadn\u0027t had time to think, much less rest, since the Director had her shuttling between the Project Voidship special and the news. Now today she was doing three jobs, broadcasting from three locations.\\n\\n She rode to the Orbiter on the shoulders of the greatest engines built by humankind. When she blasted off Pandora her cluttered office aboard the Orbiter became the eye of the storm of her life. No one, not even Flattery, could reach her there.\\n\\n The tones sounded again and seemed distinctly longer, sadder. Final boarding call. The tones once again made her think of Ben, who was still not found, who might be dead. He was no longer her lover, but he was a good man. She rubbed her eyes.\\n\\n A young security captain with very large ears entered the waiting-room hatch.

Current Control is run by Dwarf Mac.The kelp has produced a human-like being, called Crista Galli. She appeared in the water after a kelp bombing, at about age twenty. She doesn\u0027t have any memory of being part of the kelp. She has been kept a prisoner by Raja Flattery for several years.An underground resistance, known as Shadowbox, has been growing.

His intention is not to build an artificial intelligence for ship control, but use three OMCs (Organic Mental Core) left in hibernation.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-ascension-factor-destination-void-4.jpg","author":"Frank Herbert","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-ascension-factor-destination-void-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:19 PM"}}
