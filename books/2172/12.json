Children?\"\n Her camera crew was warming to the task. They had not brought a monitor into the tiny space, and now she wished they had. It might be an OK piece, after all.\n While staring at this brain behind glass, Beatriz knew that it was alive, a person. She also realized that the tech was surrounded by the squad that had murdered her crew and he probably hadn\u0027t the slightest inkling of what had happened.\n No one will know if I don\u0027t tell them, Beatriz thought. I\u0027m like this brain, cut off but alive inside. I wonder what she dreams?\n \"I know very little about the person,\" he said. \"It\u0027s in the record. I do know that she had a child that was given up for adoption so that she could continue her studies in the kelp outposts.\"\n \"Dr. MacIntosh stated two years ago that Organic Mental Cores were crude, cruel, inefficient and unnecessary,\" she said. \"Do you have a comment on that?\"\n The tech cleared his throat.\n \"I respect Dr. MacIntosh. He, along with the Director and this OMC, is one of the last survivors of the original flight of the old Earthling - \u0027Ship,\u0027 if you prefer. Yes, it\u0027s true that there were failures, and this required some compensation, but those bugs have been worked out.\"\n \"For some of our viewers, your term \u0027compensation\u0027 might seem a little cold. The \u0027compensation\u0027 you refer to was the first known creation of an artificial intelligence - one that turned out to be smarter than its creators, one that many believe is the personality \u0027Ship,\u0027 one that most Pandorans still revere as a god. Why did your department pursue the failed course of OMCs, severed living brains, rather than pick up on the artificial intelligence?\"\n \"We were instructed to take this course.\"\n \"You were ordered to take this course,\" she corrected. \"Why? Why is the Director more comfortable with failure than with the success that saved his lif... and hers?\"\n Beatriz pointed to the OMC, wired into her box, deaf, blind and dumb beside her warm, dead host.\n \"That\u0027s enough!\"\n The captain\u0027s voice behind her froze her spine and started her hands trembling. She was stunned silent again while the tech and her crew inspected the deck and their shoes.\n \"I\u0027ll speak with you in the cabin.\"\n She followed him out of the shuttle storage lockers and into the dimly lit passenger cabin.\n \"I had to stop you,\" he said. \"It is expected of me, no matter what my opinion. Soon there will be no need for deception. Prepare for docking. There will be briefing materials for the next Newsbreak when we get aboard.\"\n Three Orbiter security lounged at the docking bay as the hatch opened from the shuttle. They were ready for the press, for the Holovision cameras, but they weren\u0027t ready for Captain Brood. The captain remained inside the hatchway, with Beatriz beside him.\n \"Three men out there,\" he said to her in a gentle voice. His eyes held her with that same wild glitter. She tried not to look at his face. \"Choose one for yourself. One t... entertain yourself.\"\n She was stunned at the question and his calm, disarming manner. She felt a something rise at the back of her neck, something that she\u0027d felt tingling there before the killing started groundside.\n \"You want none of them?\" he answered for her. \"How fickle.\"\n He pulled her aside and signaled the men behind them to fire. In seconds nearly a quarter of the Orbiter\u0027s token security force lay dead on the deck.\n \"Dispose of them through the shuttle airlock,\" he told his men. \"If you kill one in a room, kill all in the room. I don\u0027t want to see any bodies. Beatriz will announce that there is a revolt in progress aboard the Orbiter and the Voidship. We\u0027ve been sent to stop it.\"\n \"Why do you do this to me?\" Beatriz hissed. \"Why do you tell me I have a choice when I don\u0027t? You were going to kill them anyway, but you have to include m...\"\n He waved his hand, a dismissal gesture that she\u0027d long associated with Flattery.\n \"A diversion,\" he said. \"Part of a gam... but see, you are stronger for it already. It amuses me, and it strengthens you.\"\n \"It\u0027s torture to me,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want to get stronger. I don\u0027t want people to die.\"\n \"Everybody dies,\" he said, motioning his men aboard. \"What a waste when they don\u0027t die for someone\u0027s convenience.\"\n Anyone who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it may expect to be destroyed by it.\n - Machiavelli, The Prince\n Spider Nevi\u0027s favorite color was green, he found it peaceful. He jockeyed Flattery\u0027s private foil across the green-tinged seas and allowed the plush command couch to soothe the tension out of his back and shoulders. Green was the color of new-growth kelp, and tens of thousands of square kilometers of it stretched out around them as far as the eye could see.\n Some sunny days Nevi spun a foil out of moorage just to drift a kelp bed, enjoying the smell of salt water and iodine, the calm of all that green. He didn\u0027t like red, it reminded him of work and always seemed so angry. The interior of Flattery\u0027s foil was finished in red, upholstered in red. The coffee cup that Zentz handed him was also red.\n \"What\u0027s so special about this Tatoosh woman,\" Zentz gurgled, \"the Director got the hots for her?\"\n Nevi ignored the question, partly because he wasn\u0027t listening, partly because he didn\u0027t care. He was about to have his first sip of coffee for the day when the Navcom warning light flicked on. He almost didn\u0027t notice it because the light, like everything else, was red. An abrasive warning tone blatted from the console and he started, spilling hot coffee into the lap of his jumpsuit. He doubted that he would have missed that tone if he were comatose. Their foil slowed automatically with the warning.\n \"Go ahead,\" he told Zentz, \"let\u0027s hear it.\"\n Zentz turned up the volume on the Navcom system. Nevi couldn\u0027t stand the radio chatter while he was trying to relax, so he\u0027d had Zentz shut it down when they hit open water.\n \"...ou are approaching a \u0027no entry\u0027 area. Sector eight is disrupted, kelpways not secure. Code your destination and alternate routes will appear on your screen. Be prepared to take on survivors. Repeat - warning, \u0027code red,\u0027 you ar...\"\n Nevi took the foil down off its step and kept the engines idling.\n \"Fools!\" Nevi muttered. \"They were warned to keep her away from the kelp.\"\n \"Do you think they\u0027re in there? Maybe they made it through befor...\" Zentz cut himself off when he saw the anger in Nevi\u0027s eyes.\n \"Get a display up,\" Nevi ordered, \"I want to get a look at this \u0027disruption.\u0027\"\n He coded in the private carrier code for Flattery\u0027s quarters. The waters around the foil had already gone from choppy to rough, and in the offshore distance Nevi could make out portions of a large sub train bobbing the surface.\n \"Yes?\" It was a female voice, curt.\n \"Nevi here, get me the Director.\"\n The display that Zentz had been working on spread across their screen. It reminded Nevi of a weather picture of a hurricane - everything on the outside swirling toward the center. But this was kelp, not clouds, and it was happening undersea, almost within sight of their point. He was not happy with the delay from Flattery\u0027s office.\n The woman\u0027s voice came back as curt as the first time.\n \"The Director is busy, Mr. Nevi, we are in full alert here. Someone blew up one of the outer offices, a security detachment has attacked the Kalaloch power plant and there is some problem with the kelp in sector eigh...\"\n \"I\u0027m in sector eight right now,\" he said, his voice as even as he could make it. \"If he can\u0027t talk, get me a direct line to Current Control.\"\n \"Current Control has been incommunicado for nearly an hour,\" she said. \"We are attempting to find out the meaning of -\"\n \"I\u0027ll keep this frequency open,\" Nevi snapped. \"Get him on the air now!\"\n Her only response was to close the circuit. Nevi pinched the bridge of his nose for a moment, staving off one of his headaches.\n \"You should\u0027ve kept her on,\" Zentz said. \"What did she mean, \u0027A security detachment has attacked the Kalaloch power plant\u0027? We defend the Kalaloch power plant.\"\n \"We need to figure out where the Galli woman is and we need to get our hands on her fast,\" Nevi interrupted. \"She\u0027s our bargaining chip no matter what\u0027s going on.\" He tapped their Navcom screen with a well-manicured finger and traced the spiral pathway that wound from edge to center.\n \"I\u0027m guessing she\u0027s in there somewhere,\" he mused, \"and anything in there is heading for the center. There isn\u0027t time to bring in any hardware. We\u0027ll have to chase them down or intercept.\"\n \"You mea... follow them in there?\" Zentz asked. \"What about the attack on the power plant? Something\u0027s coming down in the ranks and my men -\"\n \"Your men seem to be undecided about their loyalties,\" Nevi said. \"They can work that out among themselves. But I\u0027ll put you out here and radio for a pickup if you\u0027d prefer.\"\n Zentz\u0027s massive face paled, then flushed.\n \"I\u0027m no coward,\" he said, puffing himself up. \"There\u0027s just something going down at the Preserve, wher... .\"\n Flattery\u0027s carrier frequency sounded its tone and his voice crackled in their speakers.\n \"Mr. Nevi, we\u0027re having some urgent problems here that need our full attention. What do you want?\"\n \"I want a direct line to Current Control. The kelp out here is going berserk, and if you want the Galli woman we need to straighten it out or knock it down.\"\n \"I\u0027m monitoring their actions,\" Flattery said. \"They\u0027ve applied full power to that sector and the subs have all surfaced. Things here are getting sticky. A bomb went off in my outer quarters about a half hour ago. Killed my staff girl, Rachel, and that guard, Ellison. Looks like he brought the damned thing inside. Mop up out there as soon as you can and get back here. We may go Code Brutus on this one. Our Chief of Security has some answering to do.\"\n The connection was broken at Flattery\u0027s end.\n Code Brutus, Nevi thought. So, it\u0027s starting already. At least out here, right now, we don\u0027t have to choose sides.\n He had no doubt which side Zentz would ally with. For Zentz, a return to Flattery meant sure execution. Too many errors, too little strategy.\n Maybe he\u0027s already in on it, he thought.\n Zentz was on the radio to his command center at the Preserve, chewing out some major. If this was a coup from the security side, he didn\u0027t believe Zentz was in on it.\n Nevi kept his attention on the screen, where the kelp configuration didn\u0027t seem to change.\n Would it be worth it, going in after them?\n He thought it probably would. The different factions of Pandora only needed a symbol to bring them together, and Nevi knew Crista Galli was ready-made for the job. Better his hands on her than Shadowbox. Besides, he\u0027d maneuvered around troublesome kelp in the past and never had problems that he couldn\u0027t handle. And if a coup did come down, Nevi could be seen as rescuing Crista Galli, along with the very popular Ozette. That would get the media on his side.\n Either way; that LaPush has to go, he thought. That one\u0027s been too much trouble for too damned long.\n Nevi didn\u0027t want to be the one to rule Pandora, if that was what all of this came to. He was happy being the shadow, being the arranger of possibilities. His distaste for Flattery and his style grew more unbearable by the year, but he had no desire for the hot seat himself.\n Code Brutus, he thought. A coup attempt from within.\n Nevi didn\u0027t think that Zentz was capable of carrying off a coup, though he had to admit that he was in the middle of the perfect alibi - at sea with the Director\u0027s highest-ranking assistant, a known and effective assassin.\n Zentz was finished chewing out the major in charge of the power plant and the configuration of the kelp on the monitor hadn\u0027t changed a bit. Nevi checked his fuel reserves: all four tanks full. He pressurized the fuel, retracted the hydrofoils and extended the airfoil.\n \"We\u0027re going back?\" Zentz asked. His voice sounded eager, but not greedy.\n \"No,\" Nevi said, and smiled. \"We\u0027re going to pinpoint them from the air, then go in. We have enough fuel for almost an hour.\"\n After an hour they\u0027d be forced to set down on the water to extract more hydrogen, but Nevi planned to have everything that he needed aboard by then.\n The highest function of love is that it makes the loved one a unique and irreplaceable being.\n - T. Robbins, from A Literary Encyclopedia of the Atomic Age\n Beatriz was hustled through the passageway and locked inside the Orbiter\u0027s makeshift Holovision studio with three techs from Brood\u0027s crew. None of the three had been at the launch site killings, but none of them had much to say to her, either. A large portable screen behind her hid the wet lights and mirrors that cluttered all six studio bulkheads. The same Holovision logo she wore at the left breast of her jacket emblazoned the screen: it was an eye, bidimensional, but the pupil was a holo stage.\n Beatriz loved weather and had never liked the claustrophobic world inside the studios. That was why she and Ben had worked so well together and, in spite of offers, spent so many years in the field. Her recent promotion carried a lot of studio work, and her contract guaranteed a room with a view - on paper. She missed the sense of drifting she\u0027d had, growing up an Islander.\n Aboard the Orbiter she was assigned a cubby rimside, more than a kilometer from the studio near the axis. From her cubby she watched Pandora wake and sleep above her bed. Her father, a fisherman, would be taking his midafternoon break right now. Inside the studio there was no time of day, no night.\n Her instructions from Brood were simple and cold: \"Relax, we\u0027ll do the work. You just read what\u0027s in front of you when the red light goes on.\"\n A small security camera mounted high on the bulkhead kept track of her every move. It was a toy, a trinket compared to the personalized cameras and triangulators that her team used at the launch site. Holovision\u0027s equipment got worse every year. She missed her own gear.\n They were the best, she thought. And maybe that last tape is still inside.\n She wondered whether Brood\u0027s men had picked them up.\n Rico made those sets, she thought, and those triangulators, too. Nobody who knew cameras could pass those up.\n She felt her first rush of real hope. The cameras weren\u0027t down at the launch site at all.\n They\u0027re here, she thought, or at least they\u0027re in orbit with us.\n She didn\u0027t want to think about the tapes. For now, she wanted only to focus on the cameras.\n She couldn\u0027t help wondering what they\u0027d do with the tapes.\n Keep them, as backup. Record over them when their other tapes are full.\n She doubted that whatever this team planned would involve a whole lot of tape. But the techs had brought them along, her logic assured her of that.\n They might still be on the shuttle.\n She didn\u0027t want to go back to that hatchway, where Brood\u0027s men had shot those guards down.\n Beatriz glanced up at the surveillance camera.\n Is it a person behind that thing, she wondered, or tape?\n She didn\u0027t think they\u0027d waste the tape. The techs ignored her altogether. They worked quickly at several editing and sound stations, coordinating something among themselves. She suspected it had something to do with her.\n Maybe there\u0027s no one behind it.\n The three-hour light flashed. Three o\u0027clock in the afternoon marked the start of the assembly of the six-clock news. Getting the tapes was only one problem. Inserting them into a Holovision Nightly News broadcast with Brood\u0027s men watching posed another problem. She knew who could help her with the second problem, and it was the one person she most wanted to see.\n Mack could get a message groundside, coded to the right frequency and digitally encoded.\n She knew, because he\u0027d done it once for her at Ben\u0027s request.\n He was teaching me, she realized. Ben must\u0027ve thought something like this might happen.\n Most Pandorans were too hungry to fight, she knew that. Thousands already slept in holes dug in the talus, under torn plastic vulnerable to demons and the weather. From her family she learned that fighting was only one way.\n She remembered something her grandfather had told her, something she\u0027d told Dwarf MacIntosh last time: \"Educate, agitate, organize.\"\n Flattery had organized the world. Now Beatriz wanted to use that organization against him.\n Communication would do it. People had their bodies. Coordination of all those bodies would be the key to their freedom.\n How to get away with it?\n Maybe she couldn\u0027t get away with it. What kind of message would she deliver then?\n It might save Ben and Rico, too, she thought, though in a part of her somewhere they were already beginning to disappear. She tried to make her shocked and exhausted mind think through all that had happened in the past twenty-four hours, all that there was to go.\n I\u0027ve got to get to Mack, she thought. That is, if Brood hasn\u0027... hasn\u0027...\n She wouldn\u0027t allow herself to complete the thought. She concentrated on what she had to work with. This small studio aboard the Orbiter had been her project all along, her excuse to stay close to the stars. It was a little larger than the one at launch site. Flattery had had it installed to be sure that the Voidship project received the best documentation, the best publicity, the world\u0027s complete attention. She knew now what its primary purpose had been all along - diversion, something to keep people looking up while Flattery stole their boots.\n The studio was divided into six engineering units and the one live set where Beatriz worked. Quarters were very cramped. Six editing screens and a couple of very large clocks kept them in touch with the world. A constant barrage of images rolled across the six screens as the editorial team groundside reviewed the day\u0027s film from the field and made their selections. There was a small holo stage in the center of the room for final mock-up and a large viewscreen behind it. Both the clocks and the growl in her belly told her things she didn\u0027t want to know.\n \"Three hours to air time,\" she said.\n Her console indicated she was speaking into a dead microphone.\n She raised her voice. \"We\u0027re five hours behind schedule.\"\n No answer. The techs worked as though she were a piece of furniture. They relayed tapes of their own groundside for editing and placement.\n Beatriz rolled her tape of the Organic Mental Core up one of the screens and suppressed a shudder. This was a person, a living, thinking brain, kept alive by attachment to a comatose host. She wondered what it was that caused the coma. She was certain that she knew who.\n \"I need to talk with Dr. MacIntosh,\" she said.\n This was not the first time she\u0027d said it, and the response was always the same - silence. She\u0027d received the silent treatment from the techs since docking aboard the Orbiter. From the occasional glances in her direction she surmised this to be orders from Brood, rather than choice.\n Unlike counterparts of old, this OMC would be able to talk, using neuroelectrical pickups. When the time came it could communicate with the neuromusculature of the ship, feel everything that transpired aboard. This, Flattery reasoned, would keep the OMC sane where the original OMCs had failed.\n It was clear to Beatriz that Flattery didn\u0027t want to face the kind of artificial consciousness that had brought humankind to Pandora. There were those who believed that Ship still existed, and would return. The hyb tanks that had brought Flattery, Mack and Alyssa Marsh were evidence to Beatriz that Ship could be very much alive, God or not.\n If I can get one of these techs to start talking, that would be a wedge against Brood, she thought. And it might be a way to Mack.\n Current Control and MacIntosh were only a few meters down the passageway. Beatriz could practically feel the vibrations from his throaty speech, his huge body bashing about his offices. Current Control and the Holovision remote studio shared a few kilometers of cable between them, but no hatchway. Both areas were soundproofed.\n Beatriz tried to remember what Mack had taught her about their hookups. He\u0027d spent a lot of time orienting her during her trips aloft. What came to her were his philosophies and musings, the relaxing tone of his deep voice. She remembered nothing of the linkup between the two rooms. She had already tried a few electronic tricks of her own to contact him, but with no luck.\n He knows I\u0027m due, she thought. Maybe he\u0027ll come looking for me.\n She hoped that it wouldn\u0027t mean walking into his own execution. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ascension-factor-destination-void-4/page-12.html","bookId":2172,"book":{"id":2172,"title":"The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4) \n As one of three survivours of the orbiting hibernation tanks, a Raja Flattery clone has established himself as \"Director\" of Pandora.
