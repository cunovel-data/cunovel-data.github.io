If there are dead, my friend, we should get their cards for the poor.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going out there.\"\\n\\n Torvin\u0027s voice was muffled by his sleeve, but David knew he was firm on that point. It was just as well. His eyes were bad, and his feet not quick enough to outrun the security. It was a shame when the security got the cards. They sold them, or traded them. Every day Torvin and David risked their lives to give a bit of stale cake or a rind of dried fruit to a hungry one without a card. David shook his head.\\n\\n What foolishness!\\n\\n He worked beside Torvin, they were friends, yet he could not trade him a cake for a dried fruit. He had to have a marker on his card for the fruit, and Torvin would have to punch it out, and then he could have it. If Torvin didn\u0027t have a pastry marker on his card, David could not give him a cake. For Torvin to possess a cake without a proper punched card would mean losing his next turn in The Line. Under the best of conditions, he would not have expected a turn for at least a week. Under the worst conditions, he could starve with a fistful of coupons.\\n\\n \"This is craziness!\" he told Torvin. \"It is well I am old and ready to die, because the world makes no sense to me. Our children run about killing each other. It is permissible to have food on one table but not another. We have a leader who takes food from the mouths of babies so he can travel to the stars - good riddance, I say. But what will he leave behind? His bullies, who are also our children. Torvin, explain this to me.\"\\n\\n \"Bah!\"\\n\\n Torvin\u0027s faded blue sleeve was crusted with blood but the bleeding on his nose had stopped. David could tell by the way he said \"Bah!\" that the nose was stopped up. He remembered that time the security slapped him, the fragrant burst of blood in his nose.\\n\\n \"Thinking will get you into trouble,\" he heard Torvin warning him. \"We are better off to keep quiet, dry our allowance of fruit, bake our allowance of cakes and be thankful that our families have something to eat.\"\\n\\n \"Be thankful?\" David wheezed one of his silent laughs. \"You are no youngster, Torvin. Who taught you to be thankful to eat when someone across the wall has nothing? There is no greater sin, my friend, than to eat a full meal when your neighbor has none.\"\\n\\n \"We give cards to the poo...\"\\n\\n \"Graverobbers!\" David hissed. \"That\u0027s what they\u0027ve made us. Graverobbers who can be shot for throwing scraps to the hungry. This is craziness, Torvin, such craziness that this mob is making sense to me. Burn it all and start over. They are hungry no...\"\\n\\n \"Thos... animals who beat me, they are not hungry. They have cards. They work down under and we see them here daily. Where do they get off chanting \u0027We\u0027re hungry now\u0027 when -\"\\n\\n \"Listen, Torvin, to me an old man now gone crazy. Listen. We are old, you and I. You, not so old. Would you have given them something if you could?\"\\n\\n Torvin stuck his head out the hatchway, looked up and down the street, then hunched back inside.\\n\\n \"Of course. You know me, I\u0027m not a greedy man. I have done such a thing.\"\\n\\n \"Well, listen to me, old man. The mob we saw, yes, they have cards. Yes, they bring a little food home - for a family of four. If there are six, eight, ten then the card still only feeds a family of four.\"\\n\\n \"No one argues with that,\" Torvin said. \"We can\u0027t breed ourselves out of -\"\\n\\n \"When you or I get too old and have to live with our children, Ship forbid, that will be one more on a card of four. Take in a refugee who has no card, my friend. Yes, that makes it six on a card of four and the average of people who have cards is eight.\\n\\n \"The ones without cards, the stinking ones who are dying at the settlement\u0027s edge begging for food, begging for work, sleeping in the mud - they cannot run through the streets themselves to shout \u0027We\u0027re hungry now,\u0027 because they can barely stand. We give crumbs from our guilt, from our shame. This mob gives their bodies, their voices to the hungry. They give whatever they have.\"\\n\\n David leaned heavily on his folded table and got to his feet. The mob had moved on quickly. Had his body allowed, he might have followed them. He watched Torvin test his nose gingerly with his fingertips.\\n\\n \"I am afraid, David, of people like that. They might have killed us. It could have happened.\"\\n\\n Torvin sounded as if he had corks in his nose.\\n\\n David shrugged.\\n\\n \"They are afraid, too, because only the card gives them a place in The Line, and then only when their turns come around. Without a card, how long before you or I wake up in the mud downcoast? How many nights, Torvin, could you sleep in the mud and still wake in the morning?\"\\n\\n Torvin tested the bridge of his nose again, wincing.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like this, David. I don\u0027t like getting beat u...\"\\n\\n \"Such drama,\" David said. \"The man was pushed in here. You were hiding under your table and the corner hit your nose. That is not a beating. The Poet, over there, now that man took a beating.\"\\n\\n David\u0027s nod indicated a dark shape pacing the hatchway across from them. The street was nearly clear, only a few stragglers scurried about, dodging the stunsticks of security. The Line to the warehouse was reforming already as the bravest, or the hungriest, came out of hiding.\\n\\n Only one adult and one child of a card could wait in line, so the chore usually fell to the strongest unemployed member. Whoever did the shopping might have to carry out a two weeks\u0027 supply of foodstuffs for eight people or more. Security protection was good in The Line, but spotty elsewhere, so there were actually two lines, one on one side of the street going in and one on the other going out.\\n\\n Licensed vendors like David and Torvin worked The Line, selling to those who were afraid they wouldn\u0027t get inside today, or who wanted a little something different to take home to the wots.\\n\\n The man they called \"the Poet\" across the way worked his way up and down The Line each day, babbling of Ship and the return of Ship. He was careful not to speak against Flattery\u0027s Voidship project. He had done that once, and come back a broken man. The Poet had not stood upright since, but walked in a shuffle, bent nearly double at the waist. David could hear him now, shouting after the tail-end of the mob:\\n\\n \"I have been to the mountaintop! Let freedom ring!\"\\n\\n \"That one?\" Torvin snorted, and started his nose bleeding again. \"That one has been into the spore-dust once too often.\"\\n\\n David smiled at his friend. He and Torvin were nearly the same age, in their sixties, but he hadn\u0027t known Torvin long. There was much he had never told him.\\n\\n \"I was taken once,\" David whispered. \"A security wanted cakes without a marker and I wouldn\u0027t give them to him. I knew if I did he would be back every day. He bullied me. I would rather give them to the poor, so I did a foolish thing. I threw them into The Line, and there was a scramble. Well, I knew I would be arrested, but I forgot about the others. They rounded up everyone who had a cake without a punch on the card and took them in.\"\\n\\n Torvin\u0027s face paled. \"My friend, I didn\u0027t kno... what did they do to you?\"\\n\\n \"They took me to a shed that had cubicles in it, separated by curtains. In each one they were doing something to someone. The screams were terrible, and the smel...\"\\n\\n David took a deep breath and let it out slow. The Poet was still gesturing and railing from his hatchway.\\n\\n \"He was there, in the cubicle next to me. He was an important man from down under who was the director of all of Holovision. Flattery had taken ove...idn\u0027t know that - and this man had commented on the air that Flattery wanted to brainwash the world.\"\\n\\n \"A brave man,\" Torvin said. He appraised the Poet in a new light.\\n\\n \"A fool,\" David said. \"He would\u0027ve been better off to find a way to fight inside, or hidden out to do something like those Shadowbox people are doing. He must\u0027ve known what would happen.\"\\n\\n David dusted off his threadbare trousers, put on his cap and leaned against the hatchway, his gaze very distant and his voice low.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you what happened to him. They put him in a metal barrel, bent over double, and tied a block of concrete to his testicles. There was no floor in the barrel, so he could move it around by shuffling, but he had to keep bent over, and his knees bent down, to keep the weight off his testicles. His hands were tied behind his back, and throughout the day they would beat the sides of the barrel with those sticks they carry.\\n\\n \"They seldom fed him, but when they did he had to take food and water from the floor, bent over like that, an animal inside the barrel. He was a learned man. I never heard him curse. He only prayed. He prayed to every god I\u0027ve heard of, and many that I don\u0027t know. They made him crazy to discredit him - who would believe a madman? Particularly a madman who eats bugs and scraps and sometimes dirt to stay alive.\"\\n\\n Torvin was quiet for many blinks, digesting what his friend had told him. The Poet continued his rant, and the few security patrolling nearby ignored him.\\n\\n \"My friend,\" Torvin said, \"what did the... were yo... ?\"\\n\\n \"They beat me,\" David said. \"It was nothing. I was in and out in a day for being insubordinate. I don\u0027t think the captain cared much for the security guard who charged me. At any rate, he was never seen on this street again. Look, now. It is clear, and we should go sell what we can. I want to get home and check on my Annie. She worries about me in times like this.\"\\n\\n Both men strapped on their little folding tables that fit around their waists and hurriedly neatened their wares. As they stepped into the muddy street Torvin heard the Poet\u0027s hoarse voice exhort him, \"Brother, brother, let freedom ring!\"\\n\\n Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master.\\n\\n - Mary Shelley, Frankenstein, Vashon Literature Repository\\n\\n Spider Nevi watched Rico pull the gangway up and onto the deck of the Flying Fish, then he manipulated the sensor for a close view of Rico\u0027s back as he turned away.\\n\\n \"Lasgun there,\" Nevi said, and tapped a finger against the screen. \"Belt, middle of the back. Carries himself like a fighter.\"\\n\\n Nevi never once glanced at the security officer watching the screen at his side. As the Flying Fish departed moorage he switched to another sensor at the mouth of the harbor, one that confirmed Crista Galli\u0027s presence on board.\\n\\n At Nevi\u0027s command, the sensor zoomed in on the cabin of the passing foil, revealing LaPush in the copilot\u0027s seat and Crista Galli buckled in behind him. Ozette sat to her left, behind the pilot, and was speaking to her. Nevi recognized the pilot, Elvira, and cursed under his breath.\\n\\n \"If your security launch tries an intercept, it will be outclassed,\" he said. \"What then?\"\\n\\n \"There will be a show of force,\" Zentz said, \"then a warning shot.\"\\n\\n \"And then?\"\\n\\n Zentz cleared his throat, stroked the swollen area near the middle of his face that functioned as a nose.\\n\\n \"Shoot to disable.\"\\n\\n Nevi snorted at the ridiculousness of it. A laser cannon strike on a hydrogen-ram foil could ignite a fireball a thousand meters wide. He thought that a rather narrow definition of \"disable.\"\\n\\n Zentz continued, flustered at Nevi\u0027s silence.\\n\\n \"The Director declared a \u0027state of security\u0027 almost a year ago,\" he said. \"You know the routine: mandatory interception and search of all vessels, except company ferries, that enter or leave Kalaloch; search of any air or ground craft entering or leaving the perimete...\"\\n\\n Nevi let Zentz go on with his tedious recital.\\n\\n Flattery\u0027s precious Preserve was his nest, and Nevi knew he would take no chances here. But Nevi was sure that any interception of the Flying Fish right now could easily be bungled into a disaster of the greatest proportions. Flattery had just called him to duty because Zentz had permitted such a bungle.\\n\\n \"We want Shadowbox and Crista Galli,\" Nevi said. \"To exterminate nerve runners you have to bum their nest. This foil, intact, will lead us there.\"\\n\\n Zentz, ramrod-stiff in his seat, cleared his dry throat and offered, \"We suspect LaPush has been a Shadow commandant for about six year...\"\\n\\n \"Your crew is not to interfere with this vessel,\" Nevi ordered. He keyed in the security frequency on his console. \"You can give the order right here.\" He flipped a switch and looked Zentz in the eyes.\\n\\n Zentz cleared his throat again, then leaned toward the microphone.\\n\\n \"Zentz here. Thirty-four, disregard white class-three foil departing harbor.\"\\n\\n \"Sir,\" a young voice came back, \"by the Director\u0027s orders we\u0027re to seize any vessels sighted but not searched.\"\\n\\n Zentz paused, and in that pause Nevi enjoyed the exquisite dilemma that was now added to the Security Chiefs fatigue. There was only one way out, one way to satisfy the by-the-book greenhorn officer, one way to keep the Director at bay.\\n\\n \"I searched it personally at dockside,\" Zentz said. \"We know what\u0027s on board.\"\\n\\n Nevi switched off the connection, satisfied with the choice he\u0027d made in Zentz. If it came right down to it, Zentz would be the perfect sacrifice in the holiest of games, survival.\\n\\n \"Young officers haven\u0027t learned their priorities yet,\" Zentz said, forcing a smile.\\n\\n \"They have only learned fear,\" Nevi said. \"They mature when they understand greed.\"\\n\\n Zentz rubbed at the back of his thick neck, only half-listening. He had spent the entire night interrogating two of his best guards as an example to the rest, and now that Nevi had ordered Crista Galli out of his grasp it looked as if he was going to have to go through it all again. From the moment he\u0027d freed the foil Zentz could feel a tightening at his collar that he didn\u0027t like - it was a nooselike grip, unrelenting as baldness, cold.\\n\\n Nevi would be the death of him, this he was beginning to understand. With this came the understanding that there was nothing he could do about it, nowhere he could hide. The dasher coiled to spring, that was what Spider Nevi saw when Zentz met his gaze.\\n\\n \"I am going to make you a hero,\" Nevi said. \"I have a part for you to play. If we hand the Director Shadowbox we hand him back Pandora. The implications for you and me are obvious. You will, of course, prefer this to whatever the Director has in mind for you here?\"\\n\\n Zentz did not clear his throat, he did not speak. He nodded once and his grotesque lump of a jaw quivered with what Nevi presumed was the clenching of his teeth.\\n\\n \"It will be just you and I,\" Nevi said. \"The more we can tell the Director about these vermin and their warrens, the happier he will be. You desperately need to make him happy.\"\\n\\n The white foil slipped under the bay\u0027s waves, keeping the burning wreckage between itself and the Vashon Security foil opposite. They would be suspicious of not being challenged during an alert, this Nevi knew, but he still had the advantage. They knew he was behind them, they didn\u0027t know how close.\\n\\n Nevi used the sensor system to pan the riot that was now in full bloom in Kalaloch.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re working their way toward the Preserve,\" he noted. \"Can your men handle this?\"\\n\\n Zentz\u0027s wattles rose in indignation.\\n\\n \"Security is my business, too, Mr. Nevi. I handle it my way. We will let them throw their tantrum and trash their nest, then we will slaughter them here at the wall. They must be made to be very sorry that they attack the Preserve. The damage they do to their streets will keep the survivors busy for a time.\"\\n\\n Nevi flipped off the sensors and stood, straightening his tight suit with a tug.\\n\\n \"Secure one of Flattery\u0027s personal foils,\" Nevi snapped. \"Full gear for two, plus a week\u0027s rations. See to it there\u0027s coffee. Meet me in the Preserve hangar in one-half hour.\"\\n\\n His eyebrows indicated dismissal and Zentz rose to leave. Nevi saw the seed of hope in Zentz\u0027s eyes, a seed that Nevi would nourish to a rich blossom and snip, when necessary, to make just the right bouquet for the Director.\\n\\n I consider the positions of kings and rulers as that of dust mote... I look upon the judgment of right and wrong as the serpentine dance of a dragon, and the rise and fall of beliefs as but traces left by the four seasons.\\n\\n - Buddha\\n\\n Crista Galli reclined in a leather crew couch that smelled faintly of Rico. She gripped the armrests, eyes closed. Noise and the press of the crowd had always frightened her, at least since she had been blasted free of the kelp five years past. Memory of her life before that blast seemed hopelessly lost.\\n\\n The supple leather couch and roomy cabin muted the pierside clamor. The others had finished casting off and were returning to the cabin. A green circle flashed on the pilot\u0027s screen for each hatch they dogged behind them.\\n\\n Their pilot, a severe, sensuous woman in her mid-thirties, prepared the ballast tank pumps and other predive systems. She spoke the sequences aloud crisply as she completed her checkoff.\\n\\n \"Taking on ballast.\"\\n\\n Three fuel tanks flared together from the fire at the center of the bay and Crista felt the concussions puff her lungs. A three-headed rage of fire boiled up from the waters off their bow, heeling the foil over in a lurch to starboard. Ben and Rico sealed off the cabin and strapped in.\\n\\n \"Going down?\" Rico asked, and laughed. The pilot didn\u0027t miss a beat.\\n\\n \"No security challenge,\" she reported. \"Twenty-meter level-off mandatory until clear of marker five-five-seve...\"\\n\\n Since boarding the foil Crista had felt a calm such as she\u0027d not known for several years, in spite of the madness outside. She felt something pull her toward the mouth of the harbor, to the open water beyond. Ben handed her a child\u0027s dessert stick from his pocket.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll need the energy,\" he said. \"Once we\u0027re clear of the harbor we can raid the galley. Is the cabin air too dry for you?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she shook her head, \"it feels fine. Like my room at the Preserve.\"\\n\\n This was the cool, processed air that Crista had breathed for five years at the Preserve, free of the charcoal odors of the street braziers, the whiff of raw iodine from the beaches and scant wet blooms of upland slopes. It was air swept nearly clean of humanity - the humanity that idolized Crista Galli, the humanity she had only known now for less than a single day.\\n\\n It was midmorning yet, second sun just clearing the horizon, and Crista felt the race of sunlight through her surging pulse. She was outside the Preserve now. Regardless of the circumstances, she intended never to go back, never to be a prisoner of walls again.\\n\\n Watch yourself, an ancient one inside her warned, that you don\u0027t become a prisoner of action, or words. And remember, when you make a choice you abandon freedom of choice.\\n\\n She\u0027d had no choice in her appearance among humans, and Flattery had given her no choices since that time. She had been plucked from the vine of the kelp and dropped into Flattery\u0027s basket. Crista thought that if the people of Pandora thought her a god, it was time she acted like one. Now that the water had begun closing about the foil, she felt an energy surge her blood that she\u0027d never felt before.\\n\\n What could she do that would help herself and these people who were still alien to her? Even Ben, though she felt a love for him, was a stranger. She had tried daily for five years, and could summon no memories of her earlier life.\\n\\n Everyone, everyone is a stranger.\\n\\n She\u0027d had this thought before, but today it didn\u0027t surround her with the loneliness that it had in the past. She\u0027d touched Ben Ozette, and seen that he, too, had these thoughts and he\u0027d lived among humans for his whole life.\\n\\n This is what they could learn from the kelp, she mused. We are not alone because we are elements of one being.\\n\\n She listened as Rico muttered loudly to no one in particular.\\n\\n \"Operations won\u0027t like it,\" he said. \"Under no circumstances is she to be allowed near the sea. Of course, they\u0027re welcome to drop in here and give us a hand after they promised us the airstri...\"\\n\\n She could tell that Rico felt more comfortable in the foil. He had smiled, finally, and though he seemed to be complaining he was complaining with a smile.\\n\\n \"Ever ride a foil?\" Ben asked her.\\n\\n \"Never,\" she said, her wide eyes trying to take in everything at once. \"I\u0027ve watched them from the Preserve. This one is beautiful.\"\\n\\n \"Let me point out our three-way option,\" he said, and indicated certain diagrams on his control panel. \"We are riding Pandora\u0027s finest vehicle on, above or under the sea. The hydrofoil mode is fast on the surface, but the foil struts clog up easily in thick kelp. Except in flight, these class-one foils use the old Bangasser converter to retrieve hydrogen from seawater, a virtually infinite source of fuel. If we go to the air, we have to remember that the fuel tanks do get empty.\"\\n\\n He glanced over at Elvira\u0027s indifference and shrugged.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going down under,\" he said. \"Their lasgun\u0027s no good underwater. But this guarantees we\u0027ll be tracked, all the kelpways are heavily wired -\"\\n\\n \"It might be something bigger than Flattery doing the tracking,\" Rico interrupted. \"Heads up, we\u0027re going down.\"\\n\\n He paused and, when there was no response from Ben, he assisted Elvira with the dive checkout. While they busied themselves with tasks at their consoles, Crista watched the water close over the cabin.\\n\\n Ironically, it was probably Flattery who best understood her life among the kelp. In his hybernation, Flattery had lain nearly lifeless, his vitals monitored and maintained by several devices on and inside his body. According to Flattery\u0027s lab people, Crista Galli had lived in symbiosis with the kelp, a hundred million kelp cilia inside her, breathing for her, feeding her. They claimed that these tiny projections supported her for her first twenty years, until Flattery had this stand of kelp blown up, lobotomized to the needs of Current Control.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s like being an embryo until you\u0027re twenty,\" she\u0027d told Ben. \"There\u0027s no other way I can explain it. You don\u0027t eat, breathe, or move around much. The only people you meet are in the dreams that Avata brings. Now I don\u0027t know what was dream and what was me, it\u0027s all confused. There was no me unti... until that day. But Flattery knows something of how this feels. So does that Dwarf MacIntosh, and that brain that Flattery\u0027s hooking up to his ship.\"\\n\\n \"It sounds horrible,\" Ben had said, and she realized that it probably did.\\n\\n In dive mode the engine shift vibrated so much that it rocked her from side to side in her seat, forcing her attention back to the present.\\n\\n Crista fought back a tear, and couldn\u0027t turn away from the green water surging ahead of the cabin.\\n\\n There are laws against touching me!\\n\\n She thought of that kiss again, the one that had lasted only a blink in real time but would replay forever in her mind. Even in the hot climate of Kalaloch, Crista wore the coverings dictated by the Director. But alone, in the privacy of her suite, she had often shucked her clothes in spite of Flattery\u0027s sensors, which she knew to be everywhere.\\n\\n Any portion of her skin left bare tingled at its awareness of breezes and light. If she noticed nothing else in a day she noticed the thousand tiny touches between humans around her. It had become difficult to think of herself as human. Now, having glimpsed the public idolatry focused on her, she felt the frayed tether weaken even more.\\n\\n A surge in cabin air pressure popped her ears, and the great plasma-glass dome of the cabin settled completely under the waves. She caught herself holding her breath and cautioned herself to relax. She heard the susurrations of voices rise and fall with the pulse of the engines. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ascension-factor-destination-void-4/page-7.html","bookId":2172,"book":{"id":2172,"title":"The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4)","description":"Storyline: The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4) \\n As one of three survivours of the orbiting hibernation tanks, a Raja Flattery clone has established himself as \"Director\" of Pandora.
