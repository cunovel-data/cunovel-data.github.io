Nevi had been prompt, unhurried, arriving in a snappy gray cut of a Merman lounging suit right at the first blood of dawn.\\n\\n \"Zentz hasn\u0027t found them,\" Flattery said. His voice was clipped, betraying more anger than he wished.\\n\\n \"It was Zentz who lost them,\" Nevi countered.\\n\\n Flattery grunted. He hadn\u0027t needed the reminder, especially from Nevi.\\n\\n \"You find them,\" he said, and jabbed a finger at the air between them. \"Bring back the girl, wring what you can from the others. Save Ozette for a special occasion. He\u0027s at the bottom of this Shadowbox and they\u0027ve got to be shut down now.\"\\n\\n Nevi nodded, and the agreement was struck. Bounty would be worked out later, as usual. Nevi\u0027s terms were always reasonable, even on difficult matters, because he liked his work. His was the kind of work that might go unpracticed if it weren\u0027t for the Director.\\n\\n Every art has its canvas. Flattery thought.\\n\\n \"The airstrip is secure,\" Nevi said. \"There were preparations for them there, including a half-dozen collaborators, so we have cut them off. Solid intelligence. Zentz\u0027s men are turning the usual screws in the village. They will be forced to move the girl soon. Overland is out, that would be insane. It would have to be by water, and under diversion to get out of here. My guess would be Victoria. It would pay to wait and make as big a sweep as possible, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n \"You have the docks under watch?\"\\n\\n \"Of course. The Holovision foil is bugged, a precaution. Your sensor system is now keyed into it.\" Nevi glanced at the clock on Flattery\u0027s console. \"You should be able to tune them in just about any time.\"\\n\\n Flattery shifted slightly in his command couch, betraying his uneasiness at this loss of control. Nevi was second-guessing his moves, and he didn\u0027t like it.\\n\\n \"Well,\" Flattery said, splitting his face with a smile, \"this is magnificent! We will have them all - and you will be rewarded for this. Zentz grumbles that you steal away his best men but, dammit, you get the job done.\" He slapped his palm on the tabletop and held the smile.\\n\\n Spider Nevi\u0027s expression did not change, and he said nothing. His only response was the barest perceptible nod of his horrible head. The shape of it was more or less normal, except for the mucous slit where the nose should be. Nevi\u0027s dark skin was shot through with a glowing web work of red veins. His dark eyes glittered, missed nothing.\\n\\n \"What do you want done with the Tatoosh woman?\"\\n\\n Flattery felt his smile droop, and he tried to pick it up a bit.\\n\\n \"Beatriz Tatoosh is very helpful to us,\" Flattery said. \"She has a passion for the Voidship project that we could not buy.\" He raised his hand to stop Nevi\u0027s interruption. \"I know what you\u0027re thinking - that little tryst between her and Ozette. That\u0027s been over for over a year -\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t a \u0027little tryst,\u0027\" Nevi interrupted. \"It lasted years. They were wounded together at the miners\u0027 rebellion two years ago -\"\\n\\n \"I know women,\" Flattery hissed, \"and she will hate him for this. Running away with a younger woma... sabotaging Holovision and the Voidship. Didn\u0027t she do the broadcast as written last night?\"\\n\\n A nod from Nevi, and silence.\\n\\n \"She knows as well as we do that mentioning Ozette as party to this abduction would lend it a popularity and a credence that we cannot afford. It is over between them, and as soon as he\u0027s back in our hands everything will be over for Ben Ozette. The Tatoosh woman will be aboard the orbital assembly station this afternoon and out of our hair.\"\\n\\n At Nevi\u0027s continued silence, Flattery rubbed his hands together briskly.\\n\\n \"Now,\" he said, \"let me show you how I\u0027ve kept the kelp pruned back for the last couple of years. You know how the people resist this, it always takes a disaster to get them to go along with it. Well, the kelp\u0027s will was breached long ago by our lab at Orcas. Too complex to explain, but suffice it to say it is not merely a matter of mechanical control - diverting currents and the like. Thanks to the neurotoxin research we tapped into its emotions. Remember that stand of kelp off Lilliwaup, the one that hid the Shadow commando team?\"\\n\\n Nevi nodded. \"I remember. You told Zentz \u0027Hands off.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Flattery said. He drew himself upright in his recliner and snapped the backrest up to meet him. He keyed the holo and automatically the lights dimmed further. Between the two men, in the center of the room, appeared in miniature several monitor views of a Merman undersea outpost, a kelp station at the edge of a midgrowth stand. Kelp lights flickered from the depths beyond the outpost. The kelp station had been built atop the remnants of an old Oracle.\\n\\n Oracles, as the Pandorans called them, were those points where the kelp rooted into the crust of the planet itself. Because of the incredible depth of these three-hundred-year-old roots, and because the Mermen of old planted them in straight lines, Pandora\u0027s crust often fractured along root lines. It was such a series of fractures that had given birth to Pandora\u0027s new continents and rocky island chains.\\n\\n Flattery\u0027s private garden, \"the Greens,\" lay underground in a cavern that had once been an Oracle. Flattery had had his people burn out the three-hundred-meter-thick root to accommodate his landscaping plans.\\n\\n Three views clarified on the holo stage in front of the two men: The first was of the inside of a kelp station, with a balding Merman fretting at his control console; the second, outside the station, from the kelp perimeter, focused on the station\u0027s main hatch; the third, also outside the station, took in the gray mass of kelp from the rear hatch. The Merman looked very, very nervous.\\n\\n \"His children have been swimming in the kelp,\" Flattery said. \"He is worried. Their airfish are due for replacement. All have been dutifully taking their antidote. The kelp, when treated with my new blend, shows an unhealthy attraction for the antidote.\"\\n\\n There were occasional glimpses of the children among the kelp fronds. They moved in the ultra-slow-motion of dreams, much slower than undersea movement dictated, considerably slower than the usual polliwog wriggle of children.\\n\\n The Merman activated a pulsing tone that shut itself off after a few blinks.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the third time he\u0027s sounded \u0027Assembly,\u0027\" Flattery said. Anticipation made it difficult for him to sit still.\\n\\n The Merman spoke to a female, dressed in a worksuit, wet from her day\u0027s labor of wiring up the kelp stand for Current Control.\\n\\n \"Linna,\" he said, \"I can\u0027t get them out of the kelp. Those airfish will be dr... what\u0027s happening out there?\"\\n\\n She was thin and pale, much like her husband, but she appeared dreamy-eyed and unfocused. Most of those who worked the outposts did not wear their dive suits inside their living quarters. She worked the fringes of what the Mermen called \"the Blue Sector.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s the touch of it,\" she murmured. \"The touc... special. You don\u0027t work in it, you don\u0027t know. Not slick and cold, like before. Now the kelp feels like, wel...\" She hesitated and even on the holo Flattery could detect a blush.\\n\\n \"Like what?\" the Merman asked.\\n\\n \"... lately it feels like you when it touches me.\" Her blush accented her crop of thick blonde hair. \"Warm, kind of. And it makes me tingle inside. It makes my veins tingle.\"\\n\\n He grunted, squinted at her, and sighed. \"Where are those wots?\"\\n\\n He glanced out the plaz beside him into the dim depths beyond the compound. Flattery could detect no flicker of children swimming. He felt a niggling sense of glee at the Merman\u0027s growing apprehension.\\n\\n The Merman activated his console tone again and the proper systems check light winked on with it. His finger snapped the scanner screen.\\n\\n \"They were just there,\" the man blurted. \"This is crazy. I\u0027m going code red.\" He unlocked the one button on the console that Flattery knew no outpost wanted to press: Code Red. That would notify Current Control in the Orbiter overhead and Communications Central at the nearest Merman base that the entire compound was in imminent danger.\\n\\n \"You see?\" Flattery said. \"He\u0027s getting the idea.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going out there,\" the man announced to his wife, \"you stay put. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n No answer. She sat, still dreamy-eyed, watching the fifty-meter-long fronds of blue kelp that reached her way from the perimeter.\\n\\n The Merman scooped an airfish out of the locker beside the hatch and buckled on a toolbelt. He grabbed up a long-handled laser pruner and a set of charges. As if on second thought, he picked up the whole basket of airfish, the Mermen\u0027s symbiotic gills that filtered oxygen from the sea directly into the bloodstream.\\n\\n Ghastly things, Flattery thought with a shudder. Unconsciously, he rubbed his neck where they were customarily attached.\\n\\n Once outside, the Merman\u0027s handlight barely illuminated the stand of kelp at the compound\u0027s edge. This holo had been made at the onset of evening, and the waning light above the scene coupled with the depth darkened the holo and made it difficult to see detail of the man\u0027s fac...mall disappointment for such a good chronicle of the test itself.\\n\\n As the Merman reached the compound\u0027s perimeter within range of the kelp\u0027s longest fronds, he whirled at the click-hiss of an opening hatch. His wife swam lazily out of it directly into deep kelp. The atmosphere from their station bubbled toward the surface in a rush. He must have realized then that everything was lost as he watched the sea rush into their quarters through the un-dogged hatch. All sensors went blank.\\n\\n Flattery switched off the holo and turned up the lights. Nevi sat unmoved with the same unreadable expression on his horrible face.\\n\\n \"So the kelp lured them and ate them?\" Nevi asked.\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n \"On command?\"\\n\\n \"On command - my command.\"\\n\\n Flattery was pleased at the trace of a smile that flickered across Spider Nevi\u0027s lips. It must have been a luxury that he allowed himself for the moment.\\n\\n \"We both know what will come of the hue and cry,\" the Director said, and puffed himself a little before continuing. \"There will be a demand for vengeance. My men will be forced, by popular demand, to prune this stand back. You see how it\u0027s done?\"\\n\\n \"Very neat. I always though...\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Flattery gloated, \"so has everyone else. The kelp has been a very sensitive subject, as you know. Religious overtones and whatnot.\" Another dismissive wave of the hand. Flattery couldn\u0027t stop bragging.\\n\\n \"I had to accomplish two things: I had to get control of Current Control, and I had to find the point at which the kelp became sentient. Not necessarily smart, just sentient. By the time it sends off those damned gasbags it\u0027s too late - the only solution there is to stump the lot. We lost a lot of good kelpways for a lot of years that way.\"\\n\\n \"So, what\u0027s the key?\"\\n\\n \"The lights,\" Flattery said. He pointed out his huge plaz port at the bed just off the tideline. \"When the kelp starts to flicker, it\u0027s waking up. It\u0027s like an infant, then, and only knows what it\u0027s told. The language it speaks is chemical, electrical.\"\\n\\n \"And you do the telling?\"\\n\\n \"Of course. First, keep it out of contact with any other kelp. That\u0027s a must. They educate each other by touch. Make sure the kelpways are always very wide between stand...ilometer or more. The damned stuff can learn from leaves torn off other stands. The effect dies out very quickly. A kilometer usually does it.\"\\n\\n \"But how do yo... teach it what you want?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t teach. I manipulate. It\u0027s very old-fashioned, Mr. Nevi. Quite simply, beings gravitate toward pleasure, flee pain.\"\\n\\n \"How does it respond to this kind o... betrayal?\"\\n\\n Flattery smiled. \"Ah, yes. Betrayal is your department, is it not? Well, once pruned and kept at the light-formation stage, it doesn\u0027t remember much. Studies show that it can remember if allowed to develop to the spore-casting stage. You have just seen what the answer is to that - don\u0027t let it get that far. Also, studies show that this spore-dust can educate an ignorant stand.\"\\n\\n \"I thought it was just a nuisance,\" Nevi said. \"I didn\u0027t realize that you believed it could think.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, very much so. You forget, Mr. Nevi, I\u0027m a Chaplain/Psychiatrist. That I don\u0027t pray doesn\u0027t mea... well, any mind interests me. Anything that stands in my way interests me. This kelp does both.\"\\n\\n \"Do you consider it a \u0027worthy adversary\u0027?\" Nevi smiled.\\n\\n \"Not at all,\" Flattery barked a laugh, \"not worthy, no. It\u0027ll have to show me more than I\u0027ve seen before I consider this plant a \u0027worthy adversary.\u0027 It\u0027s merely an interesting problem, requiring interesting solutions.\"\\n\\n Nevi stood, and the crispness of his gray suit accentuated the fluidity of the muscles within it.\\n\\n \"This is your business,\" Nevi told him. \"Mine is Ozette and the girl.\"\\n\\n Flattery resisted the reflex to stand and waved a limp hand, affecting a nonchalance that he did not at all feel.\\n\\n \"Of course, of course.\" He avoided Nevi\u0027s gaze by switching the holo back on. He keyed it to the Tatoosh woman\u0027s upcoming Newsbreak. She would accompany the next shuttle flight to the Orbiter, a shuttle that contained the Organic Mental Core for hookup to the Voidship. Already the OMC was an \"it\" in his mind, rather than the \"she\" who used to be Alyssa Marsh.\\n\\n Flattery seethed inside. He\u0027d wanted something more from Nevi, something that now smelled distinctly of approval. He didn\u0027t like detecting weakness in himself, but he liked even less the notion of letting it pass unbridled.\\n\\n \"Whatever you nee...\" Flattery left the obvious unsaid.\\n\\n Nevi left everything unsaid, nodded, and then left the suite. Flattery felt a profound sense of relief, then checked it. Relief meant that he\u0027d begun to rely on Spider Nevi, when he knew full well that reliance on anyone meant a blade at the throat sooner or later. He did not intend for the throat to be his own.\\n\\n And out of the ground made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\\n\\n - Christian Book of the Dead\\n\\n A trail left the beach about a kilometer beyond the limits of the Preserve. It was a Zavatan trail, used by the faithful to transport their gleanings of the kelp from the beach to their warrens in the high reaches. Because it was a Zavatan trail it was well-kept and reasonably safe. Its rest spots were ample and afforded a sweeping vista of Flattery\u0027s huge Preserve. The jumbled, jerry-rigged tenements of Kalaloch sprawled from the downcoast side of the Preserve, covered today by a cloak of black smoke. Mazelike channels of aquafarms and jetties branched both up- and down-coast into the horizon. Distant screams and explosions echoed from the panorama below up the winding trail.\\n\\n Two Zavatan monks stopped to study the clamor rising from the settlement a few klicks away. One man was tall, lanky, with very long arms. The other was small even for a Pandoran, and moved in a scuttle that kept him tucked inside the larger man\u0027s shadow. Both were dressed in the loose, pajamalike gi of the Hylighter Lodge: durable cotton, dusky orange that represented the color of hylighters, their spirit guides.\\n\\n A gith of hylighters lazed overhead, drawn to the scene by their attraction for fire, lightning and the arc of lasguns from building to building. The hylighters dragged their ballast rocks from long tentacles and circled widely, audibly valving off hydrogen and snapping their great sails in the wind. Should they contact fire or spark, the hylighters would explode, scattering their fine blue spore-dust, which the monks gathered for their most private rituals. Many of the monks had not left the high reaches, except to walk this trail, for ten years.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a shame they don\u0027t understand,\" the younger monk mused. \"If we could only teach them the letting g...\"\\n\\n \"Judgement, too, is an anchor,\" the elder warned. \"It is Nothing that they need to know - the No-thing that frees the mind from noise and perfects the senses.\"\\n\\n He lifted his mutant arms in a long skyward reach, then turned slowly, rejoicing in the morning glow of both suns.\\n\\n This elder monk, Twisp, loved the press of sunlight on his skin. He had been a fisherman and adventurer in his youth, and what drew him to the Zavatans was not so much their contemplative life as other possibilities that he saw in them. Like most of the monks, Twisp had been wooed by the romance of the new quiet earth that rose from the sea. They summarily rejected the petty squabblings of politics and money that raged across Pandora to establish an underground network of illegal farms and hideaways.\\n\\n Twisp, however, had remained entrenched in Pandora\u0027s civil struggles, something he troubled few of his fellow Zavatans about. Now, once again, all was changing, he was changing. He had more to offer Pandora than contemplation, though he refrained from telling the younger monk so. He was not religious, merely thoughtful, and he had made a good life among the Zavatans. It would pain him greatly to leave.\\n\\n Two hylighters tacked toward them and Mose, the younger monk, set down his bag and began his Chant of Fulfillment. With this chant he hoped to be swept skyward by the mass of tentacles and transported to a higher level of being. Twisp had experienced the hylighter enlightenment at the first awakening of the kelp a quarter century past. That was before Flattery\u0027s iron fist came down, and before the people he loved were killed.\\n\\n Hylighters, though born from the kelp, remained indifferent to humans, treating them as a wonderful curiosity. Mose\u0027s chant became more vigorous as the hylighters drew near, their magnificent sail membranes golden in the sunlight.\\n\\n \"These two want their death today,\" Twisp said. \"Do you really want to go with them?\"\\n\\n It was the fire that attracted them, and Mose should know that. The younger monk had eaten too much kelp, too much hylighter spore-dust over the years. Two humans in the open near the Preserve usually meant armed security. Hylighters wanting the-death-that-meant-life learned how to draw their fire.\\n\\n Now the musty smell of their undersides filled the air. The musical flutings of their vents lilted on the breeze as they valved off hydrogen to drop closer. Mose\u0027s chant became more tremulous.\\n\\n Each hylighter carried ten tentacles in the underbelly, two of them longer than the rest. Usually these two carried rocks for ballast. Hylighters that felt the death need coming on sought out lightning, often gathering in giths to ride the afternoon thunderstorms. Sparks or fire attracted them as well, setting them off in a concussive blaze of flame and blue spore-dust. Some dragged their ballast rocks to spark a grand suicide, an ultimate orgasm.\\n\\n Twisp breathed easier when the two great hulks tacked back toward the Preserve. He interrupted Mose, whose eyes were closed and whose stubbled face was pale and sweaty.\\n\\n \"This tack will take them into range of the Preserve\u0027s perimeter cannon,\" he said. \"There will be dust to take back for the others.\"\\n\\n Mose silenced himself and followed Twisp\u0027s long pointing arm. The two hylighters tacked in tight formation, using all that they could capture of the slight breeze blowing up from the shore.\\n\\n \"Flattery\u0027s security will wait to fire until the hylighters are over the settlement,\" Twisp whispered. \"That way, the hylighters become a weapon. Watch.\"\\n\\n It was almost as he said. Either the cannoneer was a fool or one of the Islanders got in a clear shot, but the hylighters exploded over the Preserve in a double blast that took Twisp\u0027s breath away and stung his eyes with light. Much of the main compound aboveground was incinerated in the fireball and the great wall of the Preserve was breached for a hundred meters in either direction.\\n\\n A lull in the fighting brought his ears the cacophonous screams of the charred and the dying. It was a sound that Twisp remembered all too well.\\n\\n The young Mose came down this trail seldom and had been only twelve when he went to live in the high reaches. He did not have much of a life in the outside world, and knew little of the ways of human hatred and greed.\\n\\n \"All we can do is stay out of it,\" Twisp muttered. \"They will have at themselves and leave us in peace.\"\\n\\n The wet patter of hylighter shreds fell among the brush and rocks below them.\\n\\n There will be the refugees, too, he thought. Always the homeless and the hungry. Where will we put them this time?\\n\\n The Zavatans supported refugee camps all along the coastline, turning some into gardens, hydroponics ranches and fish farms. Twisp calculated that there were already more refugees both up- and downcoast than Flattery housed in Kalaloch. Though it was true everyone was hungry, only those in Kalaloch starved. This was the story he hoped Shadowbox would tell.\\n\\n In time, the Director will be the hungry one.\\n\\n Twisp remembered Guemes Island and the refugees of twenty-five years ago, hacked and burned and stacked like dead maki in a Merman rescue station down under. Twisp and a few friends hunted down the terrorists responsible, and a hylighter executed the leader. A Chaplain/Psychiatrist had been at the bottom of the trouble that time, too.\\n\\n Flattery had burrowed as much of his compound below the rock as above it, and Twisp knew of bolt-holes that led to escape routes along the shore. Flattery wouldn\u0027t need them this time. The older monk had seen fighting before, and knew Flattery\u0027s strategy: lure as many of the rebels inside as possible, then kill them all. Let them think, for a time, that they might win. Blame it on the Shadows. The rest, who lost everything but their lives, would not rise so easily to anger again.\\n\\n Mose pulled at his garment, straightening the folds. He faced away from the horror below. His eyes did not meet Twisp\u0027s, but focused in the middle distance beyond the trail. His were eyes sunken deeply for one so young, for one dwelling among the untroubled. He was attempting inner peace at breakneck speed. He shaved his head daily, customary these days with younger Zavatan monks and many nuns. Many ragged scars crisscrossed his scalp from his reconstruction surgery.\\n\\n Twisp was one of a handful of exceptions. His full head of long, graying hair was tied into a single braid at the back, mimicking the family style of an old friend, long dead. His friend, Shadow Panille, was said to have been of the blood lines that led to Crista Galli.\\n\\n \"We should get the others,\" Mose said. \"We\u0027ll need lasguns if we\u0027re going dust-gathering in the valley.\"\\n\\n Twisp shaded his eyes and surveyed the scene below. A blur that must be villagers spilled into the Preserve\u0027s compound. Running the other way, like fish fighting their way upcurrent, Flattery\u0027s precious cattle from the Preserve stampeded out the breached wall and into the unprotected valley.\\n\\n Security had kept the demon population at a minimum near the Preserve, but with the scent of blood thick on the air and cattle milling about loose dashers were sure to follow. Things were going to get nasty enough without a new hunt of hooded dashers slinking about. He grunted himself out of reverie.\\n\\n \"Spore-dust goes bad,\" Twisp said. \"If we\u0027re going to bring any back, we\u0027ll have to do it now.\"\\n\\n He and Mose stored the kelp fronds they\u0027d collected in the shade of a white rock. Mose still did not look Twisp in the eye.\\n\\n \"Are you afraid?\" Twisp asked.\\n\\n \"Of course!\" Mose snapped back, \"aren\u0027t you? We could be killed down there. Dashers will smell th... th...\"\\n\\n \"Just moments ago you wanted to die in the arms of that hylighter,\" Twisp said. \"What\u0027s the difference? There are demons up here, too. You feel safe on the trail because we say the trail is safe. You know that some have died here in the past, others will die in the future. You stick to the trail, with no cover except these scrub bushes and the rock, no weapon but your body.\"\\n\\n Twisp pointed past the flames below them and out to sea.\\n\\n \"Weather will kill you as dead as any demon, on or off the trail. It is a danger now, as dangerous as a dasher. It always stays alive, to kill another day. If dashers come, they will go to the blood, not to us. If anything, we are safest now. This is the present, and you are alive. Stay in the present, and you stay alive.\"\\n\\n With that he shouldered his empty bag and set out in long strides for the valley and the spore-dust below. Mose stumbled along behind him, his nervous eyes too busy hunting fears to watch the trail.\\n\\n To think of a power means not only to use it, but above all to abuse it.\\n\\n - Gaston Bachelard, The Psychoanalysis of Fire\\n\\n Two old vendors hunched in a hatchway, protecting themselves and their wares from the jostlings of a mob that muscled its way toward the Preserve. One munched a smashed cake, the other nursed a bleeding nose against his sleeve.\\n\\n \"Animals!\" Torvin spat, and a fine spray of blood came with it. \"Is there anyone left who is not an animal? Except you, my friend. You are a human being.\"\\n\\n His free hand patted the other\u0027s shoulder and found a large rip in the fabric of the older man\u0027s coat.\\n\\n \"Look, David, your coa...\"\\n\\n David brushed crumbs from his chin and pulled the shoulder of his coat across his chest, closer to his good eye. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ascension-factor-destination-void-4/page-6.html","bookId":2172,"book":{"id":2172,"title":"The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4)","description":"Storyline: The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4) \\n As one of three survivours of the orbiting hibernation tanks, a Raja Flattery clone has established himself as \"Director\" of Pandora.
