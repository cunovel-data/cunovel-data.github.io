Whatever it was was warm, and it always melted downward like a hand inside her underwear. Beatriz was a strong woman, and she knew it. She also knew that Ben Ozette was the only man who ever made her weak in the knees. She sipped her wine and kept the glass at her chest.\n \"What am I thinking now?\" she asked, feeling she had to change the subject.\n \"You\u0027re wishing I\u0027d get on with whatever it was I was going to say so that we can get on with the evening.\"\n She laughed a little louder than she liked, and ran a hand through her black hair.\n \"Why, Mr. Ozette, what kind of girl do you think I am?\"\n He ignored her flirtation. His manner turned serious.\n \"I think you\u0027re the kind of girl who wants to see the best for everyone - for the refugees, yourself, even Flattery. You\u0027ve covered some of the most horrible disasters and bloodiest atrocities this world has seen. I know because I was there. Now it won\u0027t go away, so you\u0027re going away. You want to see progress, you want to see good things. Well, so d... .\"\n \"But look what you\u0027re doing!\" She fisted her thigh and scooted back in the couch. \"OK, security is more than enthusiastic, that\u0027s bad enough. If you make heroes out of the people fighting them, then more will join them. They will have to fight the same way. There will be no end to the cycle. Dammit, Ben, that\u0027s why they call it \u0027Revolution.\u0027 Wheels turn and turn in place and the vehicle gets mired down. I\u0027ve come damned close to dying more times than I can count - most of those times with you - and now I want to get somewhere. I want a famil...\"\n Ben set down his glass and grasped her hand across the table.\n \"I know,\" he said. \"I understand. Maybe I understand more than you think. I want to offer you life, advances, progress.\"\n Neither of them spoke for a while, but their hands conversed with each other in the familiar language of lovers.\n \"OK,\" she said. She tossed off her wine, trying to appear lighthearted, \"what\u0027s the plan, man?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know the plan, yet,\" he said. \"But I know the key. It\u0027s information. Our business, remember?\"\n \"Yes?\" She refilled her glass, then his. \"Explain.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t see any women in Flattery\u0027s security force, and you set out to do a story, remember? What happened?\"\n \"Not approved, we never shot a centimete...\"\n \"And how many times has that happened?\"\n \"To me? Not much. But then, there are plenty of stories to do, more than I\u0027ll ever live to do, I just find another one or take an assignmen...\"\n \"An important point,\" Ben said. He hunched over their little table, tapping the top with his index finger. \"If Flattery doesn\u0027t get flattered, the story, whatever it is, doesn\u0027t get aired. He is from a different world - literally, a different world. He is from a world that starves women and children because they are on the wrong side of an imaginary line, and he won\u0027t allow them to cross it. We are from a world that used to teach: \u0027Life, at all cost. Preserve life.\u0027 Pandora has been adversary enough. We haven\u0027t been able to afford the luxury of fighting amongst ourselves.\"\n \"So, I don\u0027t get wher...\"\n \"Half of the shows I do get dropped,\" Ben said. \"It\u0027s not because they\u0027re not good, it\u0027s because it\u0027s getting harder and harder to keep Flattery from looking like the hood that he is. What would happen if people refused to have anything to do with him - refused to speak with him, feed him, shelter him - what would happen then?\"\n She laughed again.\n \"What makes you think they\u0027d do that? It would take -\"\n \"Information. Show him up for what he is, show the people what they can do. This whole world\u0027s been a disaster since Flattery took over. He promises them food and keeps them hungry. He keeps us in line because we know what he can do to us. If people knew they\u0027d be no more hungry without Flattery, without the Vashon Security Force, would they put up with him?\"\n \"It would take a miracle,\" she finished.\n She couldn\u0027t look him in the eye. This was the conversation she really didn\u0027t want to have on their last night together. He leaned over and kissed her on the cheek.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I\u0027m running off at the mouth again. I interviewed a group of mothers today who are petitioning the Chief of Security for news of their sons and husbands who have disappeared. Another group, over five hundred mothers, says that they had sons killed but there was never an investigation, never an arrest. They say security did it, there are witnesses. Now, I don\u0027t know about that. What I do know is that mothers are the ones on the march. Holovision\u0027s refusing to pick up on it, forbidding me to report on what people have the right to know. There has to be a wa... I\u0027m just thinking out loud, is all.\"\n He kissed her again on the cheek, then lifted her chin.\n \"I\u0027ll shut up now,\" he said. He kissed her lips and she pulled him down to the carpet beside the table.\n \"Promise?\" She kissed him back, and untucked his shirt from his pants so she could get her hands under his clothes, onto his smooth, warm skin.\n His hands unbuttoned her Islander blouse, unpeeled her cotton skirt and found her bare under both.\n \"Pretty daring,\" he muttered, and kissed her belly as she undressed him.\n \"You realize we\u0027re going to get rug burn.\"\n \"I thought you promised to shut up.\"\n Her alarm went off again and startled Beatriz out of her waking dream. She shut it off and sat up to give herself some energy. Ben had been right about the rug burn. They\u0027d kicked the wine over on themselves, too. She was sure that had been the night that Ben conceived the idea for Shadowbox. She sighed, trying to lift a heavy sadness from her chest.\n Too bad we couldn\u0027t have conceived a little one, she thought. It might\u0027ve saved us both.\n If they had, she wouldn\u0027t have met Mack. Her relationship with Ben prepared her for Mack. He was a little older, and because of his upbringing on Moonbase he wanted a family as much as she did.\n Beatriz pressed the \"start\" key on her pocket messenger and it announced: \"063...\" She twisted the volume knob down and massaged her tired eyelids. The preliminary briefing from the Holovision head office would be followed by more details before air time so she half-listened, intent only on news of Ben Ozette. Another deep sigh.\n The smell at her launch site office down under was distinctly Merman - air swept clean of particulate, saturated with the scent of mold inhibitors and sterile water. Lighting in Holovision\u0027s small broadcast studio always dried things out a bit and helped her breathe easier on the air. She suspected she would be on the air again in less than half an hour.\n She pulled the legs of her singlesuit straight and unbunched the wrinkled sleeves from her armpits. Her office was backlit in the Merman way, so her reflection in the plaz was a warm one, capturing the glow of her brown skin and the sheen of her shaggy black hair. Her generation and Ben\u0027s was the first in two centuries to have more children born to the ancient norm of human appearance than not. Beatriz did not pity the severely mutated, pity was an emotion that most Pandorans could do without. She thanked the odds daily for her natural good looks. Right now she wanted a hot shower before facing her messenger\u0027s latest story of woe.\n That\u0027s what Ben always called it, she thought. She spoke it aloud, \"\u0027Another story of woe.\u0027\"\n Fatigue and a half-sleep deepened her voice enough that it sounded vaguely like his. It made her want to hear his voice, to argue with him one more time about who worked the hardest and who got the shower first. She smiled in spite of her worry. It was more than symbolic that they had always wound up in hot water together.\n It was fear for Ben that made her not want to face the messenger just yet. It was hard enough to face the fact that she still loved him, though in an unloverly way.\n Suicide, she thought. He might just as well have run the perimeter on a bet and let a dasher have at him.\n Beatriz knew the signs, and it was Ben who\u0027d made her aware of them. Crossing the Director was a survival matter.\n She dolloped enough milk into her coffee to cool it off, then sipped at the rim while she replayed the brief, chilling message.\n 0630 Memo:\n Location brief, Launch Bay Five, air time 0645.\n Lead: Crista Galli still in hands of Shadows.\n Second lead: OMCs to Orbital Station today.\n Detail: ref terrorists, arms, drugs, religious fervor, Shadows. Final assembly of Voidship drive in orbit, OMC installation imminent. Items follow on Location.\n Secondary discretion: Mandatory at 0640.\n Time out: 0631.\n Beatriz glanced at the processor\u0027s time display: 0636.\n \"Secondary Discretion!\" she muttered. That meant they were doing a time-delay. Time enough that Holovision could run a pretaped Newsbreak if she didn\u0027t show up or, worse, if they didn\u0027t like what she said on the air. Ben had warned her it would come to this.\n \"Damn!\"\n What else was he right about?\n The elevator to the Newsbreak studio at Launch Bay Five was only a dozen meters down the passageway from her office. She fingered the tangles out of her hair and hurried out the hatchway. The hurry didn\u0027t slow her worrying one whit.\n Ben had something to do with this Crista Galli thing, and she knew that Flattery knew that, too. Why, then, was there still no release on Ben? The answer was one that Ben had tried to warn her about, and it chilled her to think it.\n They\u0027ll see that he disappears, she thought. If there\u0027s nothing on him in the briefin... She didn\u0027t want to think of that.\n Flattery knows about u... about Ben, she thought. She knew about the disappearances, the bodies in the streets of Kalaloch in the mornings. Ben had warned her about this more than once and shown her firsthand, finally, how it happened. She knew that unpopular people disappeared. She had never thought it would happen to one of them.\n Another thought shook her as she faced the elevator.\n If I don\u0027t say something about him on the air, then he\u0027s going to disappear for sure!\n She was scheduled to fly with the crew that delivered the OMCs to the Orbital Station for their Voidship installation. He must know about her budding relationship with Mack, that was no secret. The installation of the Organic Mental Cores was a nice piece of propaganda for Flattery that would take her conveniently out of the picture. It would also make it impossible for her to investigate Ben\u0027s disappearance on her own.\n She hadn\u0027t known what to think last night when she\u0027d had to fill in for Ben. She\u0027d read the prompter cold, too surprised at the lie on her screen, at the suddenness of the lie, to challenge it there. Flattery had finally tossed her a gauntlet.\n What is the worst? she asked herself now.\n The worst would be that they would both disappear.\n She squeezed into the elevator among the press of techs and mechanics, left their greetings unreturned. They were a sweaty bunch in the cramped humidity.\n What is for sure?\n For sure Ben would disappear if she said nothing, if Holovision Nightly News continued to lie about his absence.\n She rounded the passageway into the studio suite of the Holovision feature assignment crew. It was an engine assembly hangar with ten-meter-high ceilings. The makeup tech\u0027s hands were fussing over Beatriz\u0027s hair and face as soon as she entered the hatchway. Someone else helped her slip into a bulky pullover blouse with the Holovision logo at the left breast. As usual, several of the crew were talking at once, none of them saying what she wanted to hear. She wouldn\u0027t be doing this Newsbreak unless Ben were still missing.\n She had seen Ben and Crista Galli together a few days ago at Flattery\u0027s compound. Ben and Crista, in the hibiscus courtyard, Ben leaning toward Crista in that intent way he had. Beatriz knew then that he had fallen in love with the girl. She also knew that he probably didn\u0027t know that yet himself.\n I should have had a talk with hi... not a lover talk, a friend talk. Now he might be dead.\n She patted her cheeks flush and the lights turned up. It was nearly time, and still she spoke to no one, heard little, viewed the blank prompter with a certain measure of fear. He had held her own gaze intently hundreds of times over the years, dozens of times with the same argument.\n \"I look at the big picture,\" she\u0027d say. \"Pandora\u0027s unstable, we\u0027ve seen that. We could all die here on any given day at the whim of meteorology. We need another worl...\" And he would always argue for the now.\n \"People are hungry now,\" he would say. \"They need to be fed now or there won\u0027t be a later for any of u...\"\n She always felt insignificant in the studio in spite of her fame, but today as they scrubbed and dusted her face, fluffed her hair and placed her earpiece she was writing her own script for the Newsbreak - one that she hoped would keep Ben in the news but keep Flattery off her back. She looked into the prompter, adjusted the contrast and cleared her throat. She had thirty seconds. She cleared her throat again, smiled at the lens cluster and took a deep breath.\n \"Ten seconds, B.\"\n She let the breath out slow, blinked her eyes for the shine and said to the red light, \"Good Morning, Pandora. This is Beatriz Tatoosh for Newsbrea...\"\n Since every object is simply the sum of its qualities, and since qualities exist only in the mind, the whole objective universe of matter and energy, atoms and stars does not exist except as a construction of the consciousness, an edifice of conventional symbols shaped by the senses of man.\n - Lincoln Barnett, The Universe and Dr. Einstein\n Alyssa Marsh lived in the past, because the past was all that Flattery could not strip from her. He had tried chemicals, laser probes, tiny implants but the person who had been Alyssa Marsh survived them all.\n He is afraid, she thought. He is afraid that my life here has made me unfit as an OMC - and he\u0027s right.\n He had taken her body away fiber by fiber, or taken her away from her body. Her carotids and jugulars had been bypassed to a life-support system and she had been decapitated, then Flattery himself excised the remaining flesh and bone from around her unfeeling brain. The only sense she retained was the vaguest sense of being. She no longer felt much kinship with humans, and had no way of knowing how long she\u0027d felt that way. Until someone hooked her up to her Voidship she had no means of measuring time. Time became her newest toy. Time, and the past.\n Even fog has substance, she thought.\n Logic told her that her brain still existed or she wouldn\u0027t be entertaining herself with these thoughts. Training in her Moon-base creche hundreds of years ago had prepared her for her responsibility as an OMC - purely mental functions, making human decisions out of mechanically derived data - but Pandora had opened up other possibilities, all of them requiring a body. Having a child, something she\u0027d never have been permitted as a Moon-base clone, changed her perspective but it didn\u0027t change her indoctrination. She kept her child\u0027s birth secret, especially from his father, Raja Lon Flattery number six, the Director.\n Without eyes or ears she would have thought herself a perpetual prisoner of a completely silent darkness. Without skin she expected not to feel, and without the rest she imagined she\u0027d sniffed her last blossom, tasted her last bootleg chocolate. None of this proved to be true.\n Alyssa had expected to be cut off from her senses, but reality proved her to be free of them instead. Like the gods, she was free now to clench the folds of time and replay her life at will, mining sensory details that she\u0027d missed when they filtered through her emotions. She did not miss her emotions much, either, but she allowed as this might be a simple denial process protecting what was left of Alyssa Marsh from the full horror of what Flattery had done to her.\n \"You\u0027ll be the Organic Mental Core,\" he had announced to her. He spoke of it as privilege, honor, as the salvation of humankind. He might have been right about the salvation of humankind. At the time, even drugged as she was, she didn\u0027t buy the first two. She recognized that she was listening to one of the oldest arguments for martyrdom known to her species.\n \"Be reasonable,\" he\u0027d told her. \"Accept this banner and you will live in a thousand bodies. The Voidship itself will become your bones, your skin.\"\n \"Spare me the speech,\" she slurred, her tongue thickened by drugs. \"I\u0027m ready. If you\u0027re not going to let me go back to my studies in the kelp, if you\u0027re not going to kill me, then just get on with it.\"\n She now felt that the major difference between herself and the kelp was that the kelp\u0027s entire body was also its brain. The tissues were integrated and the appropriate accomplishments measurable. Flattery would hear none of this.\n He had spoken to her of an Elysium of sorts, of a pain-free and disease-free life. He reminded her that an OMC in its harness was the closest that humans came to immortality. This did nothing to comfort her. She knew the insanity record of other OMCs, the rate at which they\u0027d turned rogue and destroyed their host ships and their expendable cargoes of clones, clones like herself, and Flattery, and Mack. Indeed, the same thing had happened aboard the Voidship Earthling, which brought them all to Pandora. Three OMCs went crazy and the crew had to fabricate an artificial intelligence to save their skins. It brought them to Pandora and abandoned them there.\n I\u0027m understanding that more and more, she thought. I\u0027d like to meet this Ship sometime, interface to interface.\n Words had always amused her, and a lack of flesh to laugh with did not seem to diminish that amusement. Thinking of her son was always serious, however, especially since he\u0027d made such good headway in Flattery\u0027s security service. She thought of him now because her one regret was not seeing him face to face before sh...\n ...hucked my mortal coil, she thought. I wanted to see him with my own eyes. N... I wanted him to see me befor... this.\n She had given him up to an upwardly mobile Merman couple rather than risk what would happen if Flattery found out she\u0027d borne him a son. She had been afraid he would kill her and take the son, turning him into another ruthless Director.\n I should\u0027ve kept him, she thought. He\u0027s turned out like Flattery, anyway.\n The boy would know by now - she\u0027d left the appropriate papers hidden in her cubby before Flattery reduced her to a convoluted lump of pink tissue. It had been her last act of sentimentality.\n \"Your body betrays you,\" Flattery growled that last day. \"You\u0027ve had a child. Where is it?\"\n \"I gave it up,\" she said. \"You know how I am about my work. I have no time for anything but the kelp. A chil... well, it was only a temporary inconvenience.\"\n It was the kind of argument that Flattery would make, and he bought it. He never seemed to suspect that the child was his. Their liaison had been brief enough and long enough ago that Flattery seemed not to remember it at all. He had made no further reference to it after she left his cubby for the last time more than twenty years back. He only grunted his acknowledgment, probably thinking that the child was the product of a recent indiscretion. He could not deny her passion for her work in the kelp. Only Dwarf MacIntosh shared her passion for delving into this mysterious near-consciousness that filled Pandora\u0027s seas.\n I should have kept him with me in the kelp, she thought. Now he\u0027s become what I\u0027d most feared and I\u0027ve lost his presence, too.\n In her present state, the OMC Alyssa Marsh dwelt often on that birth and those few precious moments her child had been with her. He had stopped crying immediately after birth, happy to watch the Natali as they cleaned up his mother and the room. He had a full head of black hair and seemed fully alert right from the start.\n \"He was a month overdue,\" the midwife said. \"Looks like he wasn\u0027t wasting his time in there.\"\n After a few minutes she handed him to the couple who would give him their name. Frederick and Kazimira Brood had visited her weekly for the past few months, and they had made full arrangements for his care. It would cost Alyssa dearly, but she wanted him to have the best of chances. Flattery was determined to turn Kalaloch into a real city, the center of Pandoran thought and commerce. He had hired the young Broods - an architect and a social geographer - to build the security warehouses and garrisons for his troops. There was talk at the time that they might get the university contract. Who could have foreseen the changes in Pandora, the changes in Flattery then?\n I could, she thought. I thought development of the kelp as an ally more important than raising my son.\n If she had had her body with her, she would have let out a long, slow breath to relieve the tension that would have been brewing in her belly. She had neither belly nor breath and her reason now was relatively free of emotion.\n I did the right thing, she thought. In the grand scheme of humankind, I did the right thing.\n Even if they, with minds overcome by greed, see no evil in the destruction of a family, see no sin in the treachery to friends, shall we not, who see the evil of destruction, shall we not refrain from this terrible deed?\n - from Zavatan Conversations with the Avata, Queets Twisp, elder\n Flutterby Bodeen unrolled her precious bolt of stolen muslin across the dusty attic deck. Her three young schoolmates clapped in their excitement.\n \"You did it!\" Jaka cheered. He was twelve, lanky, and the only boy. His father, like Flutterby\u0027s, worked down under at the Shuttle Launch Site, or SLS. His mother also worked at Merman Hyperconductor, so their family received nearly double the usual scrip at The Line.\n \"Shhh!\" Flutterby warned them. \"We don\u0027t want them finding us now. Leet, did you get the paints?\"\n Leet, at eleven the youngest of the four, pulled four thick tubes from under her bulky cotton blouse.\n \"Here,\" she said, without looking up, \"I couldn\u0027t get black.\"\n \"Green!\" Jaka blew out an impatient breath. \"You want them to think we\u0027re Shadows? You know they all use gree...\"\n \"Shush!\" Dana emphasized her point with a finger at her lips and an exaggerated scowl. \"Maybe we are Shadows now, did you ever think of that? They\u0027ll treat us the same if we\u0027re caught, you know.\"\n \"OK, OK,\" Flutterby interrupted. \"We\u0027re not going to get caught unless we\u0027re here all day. Dana, Jaka, we\u0027re supposed to be practicing our music, so you two play awhile. Leet and I will each make a banner, then we\u0027ll play so you can do two.\"\n \"Security\u0027s all over the street this morning,\" Dana warned.\n \"It\u0027s because of Crista Galli. Maybe they think she\u0027s around here, somewher...\"\n \"Maybe she is around her...\"\n \"We should have a lookou...\"\n \"They won\u0027t come in while wots are practicing,\" Flutterby said, and put her hand up to quiet the others. \"Who wants to have anything to do with music lessons? Besides,\" she sniffed, and her chin raised a fraction, \"my brother\u0027s a security. I know how they think.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ascension-factor-destination-void-4/page-4.html","bookId":2172,"book":{"id":2172,"title":"The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Ascension Factor (Destination: Void #4) \n As one of three survivours of the orbiting hibernation tanks, a Raja Flattery clone has established himself as \"Director\" of Pandora.
