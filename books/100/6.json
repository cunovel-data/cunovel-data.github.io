{"id":2509,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"6:1 [hgb] 那 夜 王 睡 不 着 觉 ， 就 吩 咐 人 取 历 史 来 ， 念 给 他 听 。 \n [kjv] On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. \n [bbe] That night the king was unable to get any sleep; and he sent for the books of the records; and while some one was reading them to the king, \n 6:2 [hgb] 正 遇 见 书 上 写 着 说 ， 王 的 太 监 中 有 两 个 守 门 的 ， 辟 探 和 提 列 ， 想 要 下 手 害 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 ， 末 底 改 将 这 事 告 诉 王 后 。 \n [kjv] And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king\u0027s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. \n [bbe] It came out that it was recorded in the book how Mordecai had given word of the designs of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king\u0027s servants, keepers of the door, by whom an attack on the king had been designed. \n 6:3 [hgb] 王 说 ， 末 底 改 行 了 这 事 ， 赐 他 什 么 尊 荣 爵 位 没 有 。 伺 候 王 的 臣 仆 回 答 说 ， 没 有 赐 他 什 么 。 \n [kjv] And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king\u0027s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. \n [bbe] And the king said, What honour and reward have been given to Mordecai for this? Then the servants who were waiting on the king said, Nothing has been done for him. \n 6:4 [hgb] 王 说 ， 谁 在 院 子 里 。 （ 那 时 哈 曼 正 进 王 宫 的 外 院 ， 要 求 王 将 末 底 改 挂 在 他 所 预 备 的 木 架 上 ） \n [kjv] And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king\u0027s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. \n [bbe] Then the king said, Who is in the outer room? Now Haman had come into the outer room to get the king\u0027s authority for the hanging of Mordecai on the pillar which he had made ready for him. \n 6:5 [hgb] 臣 仆 说 ， 哈 曼 站 在 院 内 。 王 说 ， 叫 他 进 来 。 \n [kjv] And the king\u0027s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. \n [bbe] And the king\u0027s servants said to him, See, Haman is waiting in the outer room. And the king said, Let him come in. \n 6:6 [hgb] 哈 曼 就 进 去 。 王 问 他 说 ， 王 所 喜 悦 尊 荣 的 人 ， 当 如 何 待 他 呢 ？ 哈 曼 心 里 说 ， 王 所 喜 悦 尊 荣 的 ， 不 是 我 是 谁 呢 ？ \n [kjv] So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself? \n [bbe] So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring? Then the thought came into Haman\u0027s mind, Whom, more than myself, would the king have pleasure in honouring? \n 6:7 [hgb] 哈 曼 就 回 答 说 ， 王 所 喜 悦 尊 荣 的 人 ， \n [kjv] And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, \n [bbe] And Haman, answering the king, said, For the man whom the king has delight in honouring, \n 6:8 [hgb] 当 将 王 常 穿 的 朝 服 和 戴 冠 的 御 马 ， \n [kjv] Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head: \n [bbe] Let them take the robes which the king generally puts on, and the horse on which the king goes, and the crown which is on his head: \n 6:9 [hgb] 都 交 给 王 极 尊 贵 的 一 个 大 臣 ， 命 他 将 衣 服 给 王 所 喜 悦 尊 荣 的 人 穿 上 ， 使 他 骑 上 马 ， 走 遍 城 里 的 街 市 ， 在 他 面 前 宣 告 说 ， 王 所 喜 悦 尊 荣 的 人 ， 就 如 此 待 他 。 \n [kjv] And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king\u0027s most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour. \n [bbe] And let the robes and the horse be given to one of the king\u0027s most noble captains, so that they may put them on the man whom the king has delight in honouring, and let him go on horseback through the streets of the town, with men crying out before him, So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring. \n 6:10 [hgb] 王 对 哈 曼 说 ， 你 速 速 将 这 衣 服 和 马 ， 照 你 所 说 的 ， 向 坐 在 朝 门 的 犹 大 人 末 底 改 去 行 。 凡 你 所 说 的 ， 一 样 不 可 缺 。 \n [kjv] Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king\u0027s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. \n [bbe] Then the king said to Haman, Go quickly, and take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, who is seated at the king\u0027s doorway: see that you do everything as you have said. \n 6:11 [hgb] 于 是 哈 曼 将 朝 服 给 末 底 改 穿 上 ， 使 他 骑 上 马 ， 走 遍 城 里 的 街 市 ， 在 他 面 前 宣 告 说 ， 王 所 喜 悦 尊 荣 的 人 ， 就 如 此 待 他 。 \n [kjv] Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour. \n [bbe] Then Haman took the robes and the horse, and dressing Mordecai in the robes, he made him go on horseback through the streets of the town, crying out before him, So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring. \n 6:12 [hgb] 末 底 改 仍 回 到 朝 门 ， 哈 曼 却 忧 忧 闷 闷 地 蒙 着 头 ， 急 忙 回 家 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And Mordecai came again to the king\u0027s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered. \n [bbe] And Mordecai came back to the king\u0027s doorway. But Haman went quickly back to his house, sad and with his head covered. \n 6:13 [hgb] 将 所 遇 的 一 切 事 ， 详 细 说 给 他 的 妻 细 利 斯 ， 和 他 的 众 朋 友 听 。 他 的 智 慧 人 ， 和 他 的 妻 细 利 斯 对 他 说 ， 你 在 末 底 改 面 前 始 而 败 落 ， 他 如 果 是 犹 大 人 ， 你 必 不 能 胜 他 ， 终 必 在 他 面 前 败 落 。 \n [kjv] And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him. \n [bbe] And Haman gave his wife Zeresh and all his friends an account of what had taken place. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, If Mordecai, who is starting to get the better of you, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not be able to do anything against him, but you will certainly go down before him. \n 6:14 [hgb] 他 们 还 与 哈 曼 说 话 的 时 候 ， 王 的 太 监 来 催 哈 曼 ， 快 去 赴 以 斯 帖 所 预 备 的 筵 席 。 \n [kjv] And while they were yet talking with him, came the king\u0027s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared. \n [bbe] While they were still talking, the king\u0027s servants came to take Haman to the feast which Esther had made ready. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159/2190.html","bookId":100,"book":{"id":100,"title":"以斯帖记 Esther","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 随 鲁 作 王 ， 从 印 度 直 到 古 实 ， 统 管 一 百 二 十 七 省 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an h...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
