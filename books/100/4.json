{"id":2507,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"4:1 [hgb] 末 底 改 知 道 所 做 的 这 一 切 事 ， 就 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 穿 麻 衣 ， 蒙 灰 尘 ， 在 城 中 行 走 ， 痛 哭 哀 号 。 [kjv] When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; [bbe] Now when Mordecai saw what was done, pulling off his robe, he put on haircloth, with dust on his head, and went out into the middle of the town, crying out with a loud and bitter cry. 4:2 [hgb] 到 了 朝 门 前 停 住 脚 步 ， 因 为 穿 麻 衣 的 不 可 进 朝 门 。 [kjv] And came even before the king\u0027s gate: for none might enter into the king\u0027s gate clothed with sackcloth. [bbe] And he came even before the king\u0027s doorway; for no one might come inside the king\u0027s door clothed in haircloth. 4:3 [hgb] 王 的 谕 旨 所 到 的 各 省 各 处 ， 犹 大 人 大 大 悲 哀 ， 禁 食 哭 泣 哀 号 ， 穿 麻 衣 躺 在 灰 中 的 甚 多 。 [kjv] And in every province, whithersoever the king\u0027s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. [bbe] And in every part of the kingdom, wherever the king\u0027s word and his order came, there was great sorrow among the Jews, and weeping and crying and going without food; and numbers of them were stretched on the earth covered with dust and haircloth. 4:4 [hgb] 王 后 以 斯 帖 的 宫 女 和 太 监 来 把 这 事 告 诉 以 斯 帖 ， 她 甚 是 忧 愁 ， 就 送 衣 服 给 末 底 改 穿 ， 要 他 脱 下 麻 衣 ， 他 却 不 受 。 [kjv] So Esther\u0027s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not. [bbe] And Esther\u0027s women and her servants came and gave her word of it. Then great was the grief of the queen: and she sent robes for Mordecai, so that his clothing of haircloth might be taken off; but he would not have them. 4:5 [hgb] 以 斯 帖 就 把 王 所 派 伺 候 她 的 一 个 太 监 ， 名 叫 哈 他 革 召 来 ， 吩 咐 他 去 见 末 底 改 ， 要 知 道 这 是 什 么 事 ， 是 什 么 缘 故 。 [kjv] Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king\u0027s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was. [bbe] Then Esther sent for Hathach, one of the king\u0027s unsexed servants whom he had given her for waiting on her, and she gave him orders to go to Mordecai and see what this was and why it was. 4:6 [hgb] 于 是 哈 他 革 出 到 朝 门 前 的 宽 阔 处 见 末 底 改 。 [kjv] So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king\u0027s gate. [bbe] So Hathach went out and saw Mordecai in the open square of the town before the king\u0027s doorway. 4:7 [hgb] 末 底 改 将 自 己 所 遇 的 事 ， 并 哈 曼 为 灭 绝 犹 大 人 ， 应 许 捐 入 王 库 的 银 数 都 告 诉 了 他 。 [kjv] And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king\u0027s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them. [bbe] And Mordecai gave him an account of what had taken place, and of the amount of money which Haman had said he would put into the king\u0027s store for the destruction of the Jews. 4:8 [hgb] 又 将 所 抄 写 传 遍 书 珊 城 ， 要 灭 绝 犹 大 人 的 旨 意 交 给 哈 他 革 ， 要 给 以 斯 帖 看 ， 又 要 给 她 说 明 ， 并 嘱 咐 她 进 去 见 王 ， 为 本 族 的 人 在 王 面 前 恳 切 祈 求 。 [kjv] Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people. [bbe] And he gave him the copy of the order which had been given out in Shushan for their destruction, ordering him to let Esther see it, and to make it clear to her; and to say to her that she was to go in to the king, requesting his mercy, and making prayer for her people. 4:9 [hgb] 哈 他 革 回 来 ， 将 末 底 改 的 话 告 诉 以 斯 帖 。 [kjv] And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. [bbe] And Hathach came back and gave Esther an account of what Mordecai had said. 4:10 [hgb] 以 斯 帖 就 吩 咐 哈 他 革 去 见 末 底 改 ， 说 ， [kjv] Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai; [bbe] Then Esther sent Hathach to say to Mordecai: 4:11 [hgb] 王 的 一 切 臣 仆 和 各 省 的 人 民 ， 都 知 道 有 一 个 定 例 ， 若 不 蒙 召 ， 擅 入 内 院 见 王 的 ， 无 论 男 女 必 被 治 死 。 除 非 王 向 他 伸 出 金 杖 ， 不 得 存 活 。 现 在 我 没 有 蒙 召 进 去 见 王 已 经 三 十 日 了 。 [kjv] All the king\u0027s servants, and the people of the king\u0027s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days. [bbe] It is common knowledge among all the king\u0027s servants and the people of every part of the kingdom, that if anyone, man or woman, comes to the king in his inner room without being sent for, there is only one law for him, that he is to be put to death; only those to whom the king\u0027s rod of gold is stretched out may keep their lives: but I have not been sent for to come before the king these thirty days. 4:12 [hgb] 人 就 把 以 斯 帖 这 话 告 诉 末 底 改 。 [kjv] And they told to Mordecai Esther\u0027s words. [bbe] And they said these words to Mordecai. 4:13 [hgb] 末 底 改 托 人 回 覆 以 斯 帖 说 ， 你 莫 想 在 王 宫 里 强 过 一 切 犹 大 人 ， 得 免 这 祸 。 [kjv] Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king\u0027s house, more than all the Jews. [bbe] Then Mordecai sent this answer back to Esther: Do not have the idea that you in the king\u0027s house will be safe from the fate of all the Jews. 4:14 [hgb] 此 时 你 若 闭 口 不 言 ， 犹 大 人 必 从 别 处 得 解 脱 ， 蒙 拯 救 ， 你 和 你 父 家 ， 必 至 灭 亡 。 焉 知 你 得 了 王 后 的 位 分 ， 不 是 为 现 今 的 机 会 吗 ？ [kjv] For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father\u0027s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? [bbe] If at this time you say nothing, then help and salvation will come to the Jews from some other place, but you and your father\u0027s family will come to destruction: and who is to say that you have not come to the kingdom even for such a time as this? 4:15 [hgb] 以 斯 帖 就 吩 咐 人 回 报 末 底 改 说 ， [kjv] Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, [bbe] Then Esther sent them back to Mordecai with this answer: 4:16 [hgb] 你 当 去 招 聚 书 珊 城 所 有 的 犹 大 人 ， 为 我 禁 食 三 昼 三 夜 ， 不 吃 不 喝 。 我 和 我 的 宫 女 也 要 这 样 禁 食 。 然 后 我 违 例 进 去 见 王 ， 我 若 死 就 死 吧 。 [kjv] Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish. [bbe] Go, get together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and go without food for me, taking no food or drink night or day for three days: and I and my women will do the same; and so I will go in to the king, which is against the law: and if death is to be my fate, then let it come. 4:17 [hgb] 于 是 末 底 改 照 以 斯 帖 一 切 所 吩 咐 的 去 行 。 [kjv] So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him. [bbe] So Mordecai went away and did everything as Esther had said.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159/2188.html","bookId":100,"book":{"id":100,"title":"以斯帖记 Esther","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 随 鲁 作 王 ， 从 印 度 直 到 古 实 ， 统 管 一 百 二 十 七 省 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an h...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
