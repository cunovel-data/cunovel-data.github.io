{"id":2510,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"7:1 [hgb] 王 带 着 哈 曼 来 赴 王 后 以 斯 帖 的 筵 席 。 \n [kjv] So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. \n [bbe] So the king and Haman came to take wine with Esther the queen. \n 7:2 [hgb] 这 第 二 次 在 酒 席 筵 前 ， 王 又 问 以 斯 帖 说 ， 王 后 以 斯 帖 阿 ， 你 要 什 么 ， 我 必 赐 给 你 。 你 求 什 么 ， 就 是 国 的 一 半 也 必 为 你 成 就 。 \n [kjv] And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom. \n [bbe] And the king said to Esther again on the second day, while they were drinking, What is your prayer, Queen Esther? for it will be given to you; and what is your request? for it will be done, even to the half of my kingdom. \n 7:3 [hgb] 王 后 以 斯 帖 回 答 说 ， 我 若 在 王 眼 前 蒙 恩 ， 王 若 以 为 美 ， 我 所 愿 的 ， 是 愿 王 将 我 的 性 命 赐 给 我 。 我 所 求 的 ， 是 求 王 将 我 的 本 族 赐 给 我 。 \n [kjv] Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request: \n [bbe] Then Esther the queen, answering, said, If I have your approval, O king, and if it is the king\u0027s pleasure, let my life be given to me in answer to my prayer, and my people at my request: \n 7:4 [hgb] 因 我 和 我 的 本 族 被 卖 了 ， 要 剪 除 杀 戮 灭 绝 我 们 。 我 们 若 被 卖 为 奴 为 婢 ， 我 也 闭 口 不 言 。 但 王 的 损 失 ， 敌 人 万 不 能 补 足 。 \n [kjv] For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king\u0027s damage. \n [bbe] For we are given up, I and my people, to destruction and death and to be cut off. If we had been taken as men-servants and women-servants for a price, I would have said nothing, for our trouble is little in comparison with the king\u0027s loss. \n 7:5 [hgb] 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 问 王 后 以 斯 帖 说 ， 擅 敢 起 意 如 此 行 的 是 谁 。 这 人 在 哪 里 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so? \n [bbe] Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, Who is he and where is he who has had this evil thought in his heart? \n 7:6 [hgb] 以 斯 帖 说 ， 仇 人 敌 人 就 是 这 恶 人 哈 曼 。 哈 曼 在 王 和 王 后 面 前 就 甚 惊 惶 。 \n [kjv] And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. \n [bbe] And Esther said, Our hater and attacker is this evil Haman. Then Haman was full of fear before the king and the queen. \n 7:7 [hgb] 王 便 大 怒 ， 起 来 离 开 酒 席 往 御 园 去 了 。 哈 曼 见 王 定 意 要 加 罪 与 他 ， 就 起 来 ， 求 王 后 以 斯 帖 救 命 。 \n [kjv] And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. \n [bbe] And the king in his wrath got up from the feast and went into the garden: and Haman got to his feet to make a prayer for his life to Esther the queen: for he saw that the king\u0027s purpose was evil against him. \n 7:8 [hgb] 王 从 御 园 回 到 酒 席 之 处 ， 见 哈 曼 伏 在 以 斯 帖 所 靠 的 榻 上 。 王 说 ， 他 竟 敢 在 宫 内 ， 在 我 面 前 凌 辱 王 后 吗 ？ 这 话 一 出 王 口 ， 人 就 蒙 了 哈 曼 的 脸 。 \n [kjv] Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king\u0027s mouth, they covered Haman\u0027s face. \n [bbe] Then the king came back from the garden into the room where they had been drinking; and Haman was stretched out on the seat where Esther was. Then the king said, Is he taking the queen by force before my eyes in my house? And while the words were on the king\u0027s lips, they put a cloth over Haman\u0027s face. \n 7:9 [hgb] 伺 候 王 的 一 个 太 监 名 叫 哈 波 拿 ， 说 ， 哈 曼 为 那 救 王 有 功 的 末 底 改 做 了 五 丈 高 的 木 架 ， 现 今 立 在 哈 曼 家 里 。 王 说 ， 把 哈 曼 挂 在 其 上 。 \n [kjv] And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon. \n [bbe] Then Harbonah, one of the unsexed servants waiting before the king, said, See, the pillar fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who said a good word for the king, is still in its place in Haman\u0027s house. Then the king said, Put him to death by hanging him on it. \n 7:10 [hgb] 于 是 人 将 哈 曼 挂 在 他 为 末 底 改 所 预 备 的 木 架 上 。 王 的 忿 怒 这 才 止 息 。 \n [kjv] So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king\u0027s wrath pacified. \n [bbe] So Haman was put to death by hanging him on the pillar he had made for Mordecai. Then the king\u0027s wrath became less. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159/2191.html","bookId":100,"book":{"id":100,"title":"以斯帖记 Esther","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 随 鲁 作 王 ， 从 印 度 直 到 古 实 ， 统 管 一 百 二 十 七 省 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an h...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
