{"id":2506,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"3:1 [hgb] 这 事 以 后 ， 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 抬 举 ， 亚 甲 族 哈 米 大 他 的 儿 子 哈 曼 ， 使 他 高 升 ， 叫 他 的 爵 位 超 过 与 他 同 事 的 一 切 臣 宰 。 \n [kjv] After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. \n [bbe] After these things, by the order of the king, Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, was lifted up and given a position of honour and a higher place than all the other captains who were with him. \n 3:2 [hgb] 在 朝 门 的 一 切 臣 仆 都 跪 拜 哈 曼 ， 因 为 王 如 此 吩 咐 。 惟 独 末 底 改 不 跪 不 拜 。 \n [kjv] And all the king\u0027s servants, that were in the king\u0027s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence. \n [bbe] And all the king\u0027s servants who were in the king\u0027s house went down to the earth before Haman and gave him honour: for so the king had given orders. But Mordecai did not go down before him or give him honour. \n 3:3 [hgb] 在 朝 门 的 臣 仆 问 末 底 改 说 ， 你 为 何 违 背 王 的 命 令 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Then the king\u0027s servants, which were in the king\u0027s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king\u0027s commandment? \n [bbe] Then the king\u0027s servants who were in the king\u0027s house said to Mordecai, Why do you go against the king\u0027s order? \n 3:4 [hgb] 他 们 天 天 劝 他 ， 他 还 是 不 听 ， 他 们 就 告 诉 哈 曼 ， 要 看 末 底 改 的 事 站 得 住 站 不 住 ， 因 他 已 经 告 诉 他 们 自 己 是 犹 大 人 。 \n [kjv] Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai\u0027s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew. \n [bbe] Now when they had said this to him day after day and he gave no attention, they let Haman have news of it, to see if Mordecai\u0027s behaviour would be overlooked: for he had said to them that he was a Jew. \n 3:5 [hgb] 哈 曼 见 末 底 改 不 跪 不 拜 ， 他 就 怒 气 填 胸 。 \n [kjv] And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath. \n [bbe] And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not go down before him and give him honour, Haman was full of wrath. \n 3:6 [hgb] 他 们 已 将 末 底 改 的 本 族 告 诉 哈 曼 。 他 以 为 下 手 害 末 底 改 一 人 是 小 事 ， 就 要 灭 绝 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 通 国 所 有 的 犹 大 人 ， 就 是 末 底 改 的 本 族 。 \n [kjv] And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai. \n [bbe] But it was not enough for him to make an attack on Mordecai only; for they had made clear to him who Mordecai\u0027s people were; so Haman made it his purpose to put an end to all the Jews, even Mordecai\u0027s people, through all the kingdom of Ahasuerus. \n 3:7 [hgb] 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 十 二 年 正 月 ， 就 是 尼 散 月 ， 人 在 哈 曼 面 前 ， 按 日 日 月 月 掣 普 珥 ， 就 是 掣 签 ， 要 定 何 月 何 日 为 吉 ， 择 定 了 十 二 月 ， 就 是 亚 达 月 。 \n [kjv] In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar. \n [bbe] In the first month, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, from day to day and from month to month they went on looking for a sign given by Pur (that is chance) before Haman, till the sign came out for the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar. \n 3:8 [hgb] 哈 曼 对 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 说 ， 有 一 种 民 ， 散 居 在 王 国 各 省 的 民 中 ， 他 们 的 律 例 与 万 民 的 律 例 不 同 ， 也 不 守 王 的 律 例 ， 所 以 容 留 他 们 与 王 无 益 。 \n [kjv] And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king\u0027s laws: therefore it is not for the king\u0027s profit to suffer them. \n [bbe] And Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain nation living here and there in small groups among the people in all the divisions of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of any other nation, and they do not keep the king\u0027s laws: for this reason it is not right for the king to let them be. \n 3:9 [hgb] 王 若 以 为 美 ， 请 下 旨 意 灭 绝 他 们 。 我 就 捐 一 万 他 连 得 银 子 交 给 掌 管 国 帑 的 人 ， 纳 入 王 的 府 库 。 \n [kjv] If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king\u0027s treasuries. \n [bbe] If it is the king\u0027s pleasure, let a statement ordering their destruction be put in writing: and I will give to those responsible for the king\u0027s business, ten thousand talents of silver for the king\u0027s store-house. \n 3:10 [hgb] 于 是 王 从 自 己 手 上 摘 下 戒 指 ， 给 犹 大 人 的 仇 敌 亚 甲 族 哈 米 大 他 的 儿 子 哈 曼 。 \n [kjv] And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews\u0027 enemy. \n [bbe] And the king took his ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the hater of the Jews. \n 3:11 [hgb] 王 对 哈 曼 说 ， 这 银 子 仍 赐 给 你 ， 这 民 也 交 给 你 ， 你 可 以 随 意 待 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee. \n [bbe] And the king said to Haman, The money is yours, and the people, to do with them whatever seems right to you. \n 3:12 [hgb] 正 月 十 三 日 ， 就 召 了 王 的 书 记 来 ， 照 着 哈 曼 一 切 所 吩 咐 的 ， 用 各 省 的 文 字 ， 各 族 的 方 言 ， 奉 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 的 名 写 旨 意 ， 传 与 总 督 和 各 省 的 省 长 ， 并 各 族 的 首 领 。 又 用 王 的 戒 指 盖 印 。 \n [kjv] Then were the king\u0027s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king\u0027s lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king\u0027s ring. \n [bbe] Then on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king\u0027s scribes were sent for, and they put in writing Haman\u0027s orders to all the king\u0027s captains and the rulers of every division of his kingdom and the chiefs of every people: for every division of the kingdom in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in the language which was theirs; it was signed in the name of King Ahasuerus and stamped with the king\u0027s ring. \n 3:13 [hgb] 交 给 驿 卒 传 到 王 的 各 省 ， 吩 咐 将 犹 大 人 ， 无 论 老 少 妇 女 孩 子 ， 在 一 日 之 间 ， 十 二 月 ， 就 是 亚 达 月 十 三 日 ， 全 然 剪 除 ， 杀 戮 灭 绝 ， 并 夺 他 们 的 财 为 掠 物 。 \n [kjv] And the letters were sent by posts into all the king\u0027s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey. \n [bbe] And letters were sent by the runners into every division of the kingdom ordering the death and destruction of all Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the same day, even the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar, and the taking of all their goods by force. \n 3:14 [hgb] 抄 录 这 旨 意 ， 颁 行 各 省 ， 宣 告 各 族 ， 使 他 们 预 备 等 候 那 日 。 \n [kjv] The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day. \n [bbe] A copy of the writing, to be made public in every part of the kingdom, was sent out to all the peoples, so that they might be ready when that day came. \n 3:15 [hgb] 驿 卒 奉 王 命 急 忙 起 行 ， 旨 意 也 传 遍 书 珊 城 。 王 同 哈 曼 坐 下 饮 酒 ， 书 珊 城 的 民 却 都 慌 乱 。 \n [kjv] The posts went out, being hastened by the king\u0027s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed. \n [bbe] The runners went out quickly by the king\u0027s order, and a public statement was made in Shushan: and the king and Haman took wine together: but the town of Shushan was troubled. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159/2187.html","bookId":100,"book":{"id":100,"title":"以斯帖记 Esther","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 随 鲁 作 王 ， 从 印 度 直 到 古 实 ， 统 管 一 百 二 十 七 省 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an h...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
