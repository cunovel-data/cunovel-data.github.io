the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him: \n [bbe] In the third year of his rule he gave a feast to all his captains and his servants; and the captains of the army of Persia and Media, the great men and the rulers of the divisions of his kingdom, were present before him; \n 1:4 [hgb] 他 把 他 荣 耀 之 国 的 丰 富 ， 和 他 美 好 威 严 的 尊 贵 ， 给 他 们 看 了 许 多 日 ， 就 是 一 百 八 十 日 。 \n [kjv] When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days. \n [bbe] And for a long time, even a hundred and eighty days, he let them see all the wealth and the glory of his kingdom and the great power and honour which were his. \n 1:5 [hgb] 这 日 子 满 了 ， 又 为 所 有 住 书 珊 城 的 大 小 人 民 ， 在 御 园 的 院 子 里 设 摆 筵 席 七 日 。 \n [kjv] And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king\u0027s palace; \n [bbe] And at the end of that time, the king gave a feast for all the people who were present in Shushan, the king\u0027s town, small as well as great, for seven days, in the outer square of the garden of the king\u0027s house. \n 1:6 [hgb] 有 白 色 ， 绿 色 ， 蓝 色 的 帐 子 ， 用 细 麻 绳 ， 紫 色 绳 从 银 环 内 系 在 白 玉 石 柱 上 。 有 金 银 的 床 榻 摆 在 红 ， 白 ， 黄 ， 黑 玉 石 铺 的 石 地 上 。 \n [kjv] Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble. \n [bbe] There were fair hangings of white and green and blue, fixed with cords of purple and the best linen to silver rings and pillars of polished stone: the seats were of gold and silver on a floor of red and white and yellow and black stone. \n 1:7 [hgb] 用 金 器 皿 赐 酒 ， 器 皿 各 有 不 同 。 御 酒 甚 多 ， 足 显 王 的 厚 意 。 \n [kjv] And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king. \n [bbe] And they gave them drink in gold vessels, every vessel being different, and wine of the kingdom, freely given by the king. \n 1:8 [hgb] 喝 酒 有 例 ， 不 准 勉 强 人 ， 因 王 吩 咐 宫 里 的 一 切 臣 宰 ， 让 人 各 随 己 意 。 \n [kjv] And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man\u0027s pleasure. \n [bbe] And the drinking was in keeping with the law; no one was forced: for the king had given orders to all the chief servants of his house to do as was pleasing to every man. \n 1:9 [hgb] 王 后 瓦 实 提 在 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 的 宫 内 ， 也 为 妇 女 设 摆 筵 席 。 \n [kjv] Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus. \n [bbe] And Vashti the queen gave a feast for the women in the house of King Ahasuerus. \n 1:10 [hgb] 第 七 日 ， 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 饮 酒 ， 心 中 快 乐 ， 就 吩 咐 在 他 面 前 侍 立 的 七 个 太 监 ， 米 户 幔 ， 比 斯 他 ， 哈 波 拿 ， 比 革 他 ， 亚 拔 他 ， 西 达 ， 甲 迦 ， \n [kjv] On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, \n [bbe] On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was glad with wine, he gave orders to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven unsexed servants who were waiting before Ahasuerus the king, \n 1:11 [hgb] 请 王 后 瓦 实 提 头 戴 王 后 的 冠 冕 到 王 面 前 ， 使 各 等 臣 民 看 她 的 美 貌 ， 因 为 她 容 貌 甚 美 。 \n [kjv] To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on. \n [bbe] That Vashti the queen was to come before him, crowned with her crown, and let the people and the captains see her: for she was very beautiful. \n 1:12 [hgb] 王 后 瓦 实 提 却 不 肯 遵 太 监 所 传 的 王 命 而 来 ， 所 以 王 甚 发 怒 ， 心 如 火 烧 。 \n [kjv] But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king\u0027s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him. \n [bbe] But when the servants gave her the king\u0027s order, Vashti the queen said she would not come: then the king was very angry, and his heart was burning with wrath. \n 1:13 [hgb] 那 时 ， 在 王 左 右 常 见 王 面 ， 国 中 坐 高 位 的 ， 有 波 斯 和 玛 代 的 七 个 大 臣 ， 就 是 甲 示 拿 ， 示 达 ， 押 玛 他 ， 他 施 斯 ， 米 力 ， 玛 西 拿 ， 米 母 干 ， 都 是 达 时 务 的 明 哲 人 。 按 王 的 常 规 ， 办 事 必 先 询 问 知 例 明 法 的 人 。 王 问 他 们 说 ， \n [kjv] Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king\u0027s manner toward all that knew law and judgment: \n [bbe] And the king said to the wise men, who had knowledge of the times, (for this was the king\u0027s way with all who were expert in law and in the giving of decisions: \n 1:14 [hgb] \n [kjv] And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king\u0027s face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;) \n [bbe] And second only to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven rulers of Persia and Media, who were friends of the king, and had the first places in the kingdom:) \n 1:15 [hgb] 王 后 瓦 实 提 不 遵 太 监 所 传 的 王 命 ， 照 例 应 当 怎 样 办 理 呢 ？ \n [kjv] What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains? \n [bbe] What is to be done by law to Vashti the queen, because she has not done what King Ahasuerus, by his servants, gave her orders to do? \n 1:16 [hgb] 米 母 干 在 王 和 众 首 领 面 前 回 答 说 ， 王 后 瓦 实 提 这 事 ， 不 但 得 罪 王 ， 并 且 有 害 于 王 各 省 的 臣 民 。 \n [kjv] And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. \n [bbe] And before the king and the captains, Memucan gave his answer: Vashti the queen has done wrong, not only to the king, but to all the captains and to all the peoples in all the divisions of the kingdom of King Ahasuerus; \n 1:17 [hgb] 因 为 王 后 这 事 必 传 到 众 妇 人 的 耳 中 ， 说 ， 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 吩 咐 王 后 瓦 实 提 到 王 面 前 ， 她 却 不 来 ， 她 们 就 藐 视 自 己 的 丈 夫 。 \n [kjv] For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not. \n [bbe] For news of what the queen has done will come to the ears of all women, and they will no longer give respect to their husbands when it is said to them, King Ahasuerus gave orders for Vashti the queen to come before him and she came not. \n 1:18 [hgb] 今 日 波 斯 和 玛 代 的 众 夫 人 听 见 王 后 这 事 ， 必 向 王 的 大 臣 照 样 行 。 从 此 必 大 开 藐 视 和 忿 怒 之 端 。 \n [kjv] Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king\u0027s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath. \n [bbe] And the wives of the captains of Persia and Media, hearing what the queen has done, will say the same to all the king\u0027s captains. So there will be much shame and wrath. \n 1:19 [hgb] 王 若 以 为 美 ， 就 降 旨 写 在 波 斯 和 玛 代 人 的 例 中 ， 永 不 更 改 ， 不 准 瓦 实 提 再 到 王 面 前 ， 将 她 王 后 的 位 分 赐 给 比 她 还 好 的 人 。 \n [kjv] If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. \n [bbe] If it is pleasing to the king, let an order go out from him, and let it be recorded among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it may never be changed, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her place to another who is better than she. \n 1:20 [hgb] 所 降 的 旨 意 传 遍 通 国 （ 国 度 本 来 广 大 ） ， 所 有 的 妇 人 ， 无 论 丈 夫 贵 贱 都 必 尊 敬 他 。 \n [kjv] And when the king\u0027s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small. \n [bbe] And when this order, given by the king, is made public through all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give honour to their husbands, great as well as small. \n 1:21 [hgb] 王 和 众 首 领 都 以 米 母 干 的 话 为 美 ， 王 就 照 这 话 去 行 ， \n [kjv] And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan: \n [bbe] And this suggestion seemed good to the king and the captains; and the king did as Memucan said; \n 1:22 [hgb] 发 诏 书 ， 用 各 省 的 文 字 ， 各 族 的 方 言 通 知 各 省 ， 使 为 丈 夫 的 在 家 中 作 主 ， 各 说 本 地 的 方 言 。 \n [kjv] For he sent letters into all the king\u0027s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people. \n [bbe] And sent letters to all the divisions of the kingdom, to every division in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in the language which was theirs, saying that every man was to be the ruler in his house, and that this order was to be given out in the language of his people. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159/2185.html","bookId":100,"book":{"id":100,"title":"以斯帖记 Esther","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 随 鲁 作 王 ， 从 印 度 直 到 古 实 ， 统 管 一 百 二 十 七 省 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an h...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
