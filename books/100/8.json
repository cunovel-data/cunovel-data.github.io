{"id":2511,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 当 日 ， 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 把 犹 大 人 仇 敌 哈 曼 的 家 产 ， 赐 给 王 后 以 斯 帖 。 末 底 改 也 来 到 王 面 前 ， 因 为 以 斯 帖 已 经 告 诉 王 ， 末 底 改 是 她 的 亲 属 。 [kjv] On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews\u0027 enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. [bbe] That day the king gave all the family of Haman, the hater of the Jews, to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had made clear what he was to her. 8:2 [hgb] 王 摘 下 自 己 的 戒 指 ， 就 是 从 哈 曼 追 回 的 ， 给 了 末 底 改 。 以 斯 帖 派 末 底 改 管 理 哈 曼 的 家 产 。 [kjv] And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. [bbe] And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther put Mordecai over the family of Haman. 8:3 [hgb] 以 斯 帖 又 俯 伏 在 王 脚 前 ， 流 泪 哀 告 ， 求 他 除 掉 亚 甲 族 哈 曼 害 犹 大 人 的 恶 谋 。 [kjv] And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews. [bbe] Then Esther again came before the king, falling down at his feet, and made request to him with weeping, that he would put a stop to the evil purposes of Haman the Agagite and the designs which he had made against the Jews. 8:4 [hgb] 王 向 以 斯 帖 伸 出 金 杖 ， 以 斯 帖 就 起 来 ， 站 在 王 前 。 [kjv] Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king, [bbe] Then the king put out the rod of gold to Esther, and she got up before the king. 8:5 [hgb] 说 ， 亚 甲 族 哈 米 大 他 的 儿 子 哈 曼 设 谋 传 旨 ， 要 杀 灭 在 王 各 省 的 犹 大 人 。 现 今 王 若 愿 意 ， 我 若 在 王 眼 前 蒙 恩 ， 王 若 以 为 美 ， 若 喜 悦 我 ， 请 王 另 下 旨 意 ， 废 除 哈 曼 所 传 的 那 旨 意 。 [kjv] And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king\u0027s provinces: [bbe] And she said, If it is the king\u0027s pleasure and if I have his approval and this thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing to him, then let letters be sent giving orders against those which Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, sent out for the destruction of the Jews in all divisions of the kingdom: 8:6 [hgb] 我 何 忍 见 我 本 族 的 人 受 害 ？ 何 忍 见 我 同 宗 的 人 被 灭 呢 ？ [kjv] For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? [bbe] For how is it possible for me to see the evil which is to overtake my nation? how may I see the destruction of my people? 8:7 [hgb] 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 对 王 后 以 斯 帖 ， 和 犹 大 人 末 底 改 说 ， 因 哈 曼 要 下 手 害 犹 大 人 ， 我 已 将 他 的 家 产 赐 给 以 斯 帖 ， 人 也 将 哈 曼 挂 在 木 架 上 。 [kjv] Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. [bbe] Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, See now, I have given Esther the family of Haman, and he has come to his death by hanging, because he made an attack on the Jews. 8:8 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 可 以 随 意 ， 奉 王 的 名 写 谕 旨 给 犹 大 人 ， 用 王 的 戒 指 盖 印 。 因 为 奉 王 名 所 写 ， 用 王 戒 指 盖 印 的 谕 旨 ， 人 都 不 能 废 除 。 [kjv] Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king\u0027s name, and seal it with the king\u0027s ring: for the writing which is written in the king\u0027s name, and sealed with the king\u0027s ring, may no man reverse. [bbe] So now send a letter about the Jews, writing whatever seems good to you, in the king\u0027s name, and stamping it with the king\u0027s ring: for a writing signed in the king\u0027s name and stamped with the king\u0027s ring may not be changed. 8:9 [hgb] 三 月 ， 就 是 西 弯 月 二 十 三 日 ， 将 王 的 书 记 召 来 。 按 着 末 底 改 所 吩 咐 的 ， 用 各 省 的 文 字 ， 各 族 的 方 言 ， 并 犹 大 人 的 文 字 方 言 写 谕 旨 。 传 给 那 从 印 度 直 到 古 实 一 百 二 十 七 省 的 犹 大 人 和 总 督 省 长 首 领 。 [kjv] Then were the king\u0027s scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language. [bbe] Then at that time, on the twenty-third day of the third month, which is the month Sivan, the king\u0027s scribes were sent for; and everything ordered by Mordecai was put in writing and sent to the Jews and the captains and the rulers and the chiefs of all the divisions of the kingdom from India to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven divisions, to every division in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing and their language. 8:10 [hgb] 末 底 改 奉 亚 哈 随 鲁 王 的 名 写 谕 旨 ， 用 王 的 戒 指 盖 印 ， 交 给 骑 御 马 圈 快 马 的 驿 卒 ， 传 到 各 处 。 [kjv] And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus\u0027 name, and sealed it with the king\u0027s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries: [bbe] The letters were sent in the name of King Ahasuerus and stamped with his ring, and they were taken by men on horseback, going on the quick-running horses used for the king\u0027s business, the offspring of his best horses: 8:11 [hgb] 谕 旨 中 ， 王 准 各 省 各 城 的 犹 大 人 在 一 日 之 间 ， 十 二 月 ， 就 是 亚 达 月 十 三 日 ， 聚 集 保 护 性 命 ， 剪 除 杀 戮 灭 绝 那 要 攻 击 犹 大 人 的 一 切 仇 敌 ， 和 他 们 的 妻 子 儿 女 ， 夺 取 他 们 的 财 为 掠 物 。 [kjv] Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, [bbe] In these letters the king gave authority to the Jews in every town to come together and make a fight for their lives, and to send death and destruction on the power of any people in any part of the kingdom attacking them or their children or their women, and to take their goods from them by force, 8:12 [hgb] [kjv] Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. [bbe] On one day in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, that is, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar. 8:13 [hgb] 抄 录 这 谕 旨 ， 颁 行 各 省 ， 宣 告 各 族 ， 使 犹 大 人 预 备 等 候 那 日 ， 在 仇 敌 身 上 报 仇 。 [kjv] The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. [bbe] A copy of the writing, to be made public as an order in every division of the kingdom, was given out to all the peoples, so that the Jews might be ready when that day came to give punishment to their haters. 8:14 [hgb] 于 是 骑 快 马 的 驿 卒 被 王 命 催 促 ， 急 忙 起 行 。 谕 旨 也 传 遍 书 珊 城 。 [kjv] So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king\u0027s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace. [bbe] So the men went out on the quick-running horses used on the king\u0027s business, wasting no time and forced on by the king\u0027s order; and the order was given out in Shushan, the king\u0027s town. 8:15 [hgb] 末 底 改 穿 着 蓝 色 白 色 的 朝 服 ， 头 戴 大 金 冠 冕 ， 又 穿 紫 色 细 麻 布 的 外 袍 ， 从 王 面 前 出 来 。 书 珊 城 的 人 民 都 欢 呼 快 乐 。 [kjv] And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. [bbe] And Mordecai went out from before the king, dressed in king-like robes of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold and clothing of purple and the best linen: and all the town of Shushan gave loud cries of joy. 8:16 [hgb] 犹 大 人 有 光 荣 ， 欢 喜 快 乐 而 得 尊 贵 。 [kjv] The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour. [bbe] And the Jews had light and joy and honour. 8:17 [hgb] 王 的 谕 旨 所 到 的 各 省 各 城 ， 犹 大 人 都 欢 喜 快 乐 ， 设 摆 筵 宴 ， 以 那 日 为 吉 日 。 那 国 的 人 民 ， 有 许 多 因 惧 怕 犹 大 人 ， 就 入 了 犹 大 籍 。 [kjv] And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king\u0027s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them. [bbe] And in every part of the kingdom and in every town, wherever the king\u0027s letter and his order came, the Jews were glad with great joy, and had a feast and a good day. And a great number of the people of the land became Jews: for the fear of the Jews had come on them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159/2192.html","bookId":100,"book":{"id":100,"title":"以斯帖记 Esther","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 随 鲁 作 王 ， 从 印 度 直 到 古 实 ， 统 管 一 百 二 十 七 省 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an h...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
