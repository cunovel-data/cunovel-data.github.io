I brush past the gaping Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button with my fist. The doors slide together and I zip upward. I actually make it back to my floor before the tears start running down my cheeks. I can hear the others calling me from the sitting room, but I fly down the hall into my room, bolt the door, and fling myself onto my bed. Then I really begin to sob.\\n\\n Now I\u0027ve done it! Now I\u0027ve ruined everything! If I\u0027d stood even a ghost of chance, it vanished when I sent that arrow flying at the Gamemakers. What will they do to me now? Arrest me? Execute me? Cut my tongue and turn me into an Avox so I can wait on the future tributes of Panem? What was I thinking, shooting at the Gamemakers? Of course, I wasn\u0027t, I was shooting at that apple because I was so angry at being ignored. I wasn\u0027t trying to kill one of them. If I were, they\u0027d be dead!\\n\\n Oh, what does it matter? It\u0027s not like I was going to win the Games anyway. Who cares what they do to me? What really scares me is what they might do to my mother and Prim, how my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness. Will they take their few belongings, or send my mother to prison and Prim to the community home, or kill them? They wouldn\u0027t kill them, would they? Why not? What do they care?\\n\\n I should have stayed and apologized. Or laughed, like it was a big joke. Then maybe I would have found some leniency. But instead I stalked out of the place in the most disrespectful manner possible.\\n\\n Haymitch and Effie are knocking on my door. I shout for them to go away and eventually they do. It takes at least an hour for me to cry myself out. Then I just lay curled up on the bed, stroking the silken sheets, watching the sun set over the artificial candy Capitol.\\n\\n At first, I expect guards to come for me. But as time passes, it seems less likely. I calm down. They still need a girl tribute from District 12, don\u0027t they? If the Gamemakers want to punish me, they can do it publicly. Wait until I\u0027m in the arena and sic starving wild animals on me. You can bet they\u0027ll make sure I don\u0027t have a bow and arrow to defend myself.\\n\\n Before that though, they\u0027ll give me a score so low, no one in their right mind would sponsor me. That\u0027s what will happen tonight. Since the training isn\u0027t open to viewers, the Gamemakers announce a score for each player. It gives the audience a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout the Games. The number, which is between one and twelve, one being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably high, signifies the promise of the tribute. The mark is not a guarantee of which person will win. It\u0027s only an indication of the potential a tribute showed in training. Often, because of the variables in the actual arena, high-scoring tributes go down almost immediately. And a few years ago, the boy who won the Games only received a three. Still, the scores can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship. I had been hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or a seven, even if I\u0027m not particularly powerful. Now I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll have the lowest score of the twenty-four. If no one sponsors me, my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero.\\n\\n When Effie taps on the door to call me to dinner, I decide I may as well go. The scores will be televised tonight. It\u0027s not like I can hide what happened forever. I go to the bathroom and wash my face, but it\u0027s still red and splotchy.\\n\\n Everyone\u0027s waiting at the table, even Cinna and Portia. I wish the stylists hadn\u0027t shown up because for some reason, I don\u0027t like the idea of disappointing them. It\u0027s as if I\u0027ve thrown away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies without a thought. I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny spoonfuls of fish soup. The saltiness reminds me of my tears.\\n\\n The adults begin some chitchat about the weather forecast, and I let my eyes meet Peeta\u0027s. He raises his eyebrows. A question. What happened? I just give my head a small shake. Then, as they\u0027re serving the main course, I hear Haymitch say, \"Okay, enough small talk, just how bad were you today?\"\\n\\n Peeta jumps in. \"I don\u0027t know that it mattered. By the time I showed up, no one even bothered to look at me. They were singing some kind of drinking song, I think. So, I threw around some heavy objects until they told me I could go.\"\\n\\n That makes me feel a bit better. It\u0027s not like Peeta attacked the Gamemakers, but at least he was provoked, too.\\n\\n \"And you, sweetheart?\" says Haymitch.\\n\\n Somehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me off enough that I\u0027m at least able to speak. \"I shot an arrow at the Gamemakers.\"\\n\\n Everyone stops eating. \"You what?\" The horror in Effie\u0027s voice confirms my worse suspicions.\\n\\n \"I shot an arrow at them. Not exactly at them. In their direction. It\u0027s like Peeta said, I was shooting and they were ignoring me and I just. I just lost my head, so I shot an apple out of their stupid roast pig\u0027s mouth!\" I say defiantly.\\n\\n \"And what did they say?\" says Cinna carefully.\\n\\n \"Nothing. Or I don\u0027t know. I walked out after that,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Without being dismissed?\" gasps Effie.\\n\\n \"I dismissed myself,\" I said. I remember how I promised Prim that I really would try to win and I feel like a ton of coal has dropped on me.\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s that,\" says Haymitch. Then he butters a roll.\\n\\n \"Do you think they\u0027ll arrest me?\" I ask. \"Doubt it. Be a pain to replace you at this stage,\" says Haymitch.\\n\\n \"What about my family?\" I say. \"Will they punish them?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t think so. Wouldn\u0027t make much sense. See they\u0027d have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population. People would need to know what you did. But they can\u0027t since it\u0027s secret, so it\u0027d be a waste of effort,\" says Haymitch. \"More likely they\u0027ll make your life hell in the arena.\"\\n\\n \"Well, they\u0027ve already promised to do that to us any way,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n \"Very true,\" says Haymitch. And I realize the impossible has happened. They have actually cheered me up. Haymitch picks up a pork chop with his fingers, which makes Effie frown, and dunks it in his wine. He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to chuckle. \"What were their faces like?\"\\n\\n I can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up. \"Shocked. Terrified. Uh, ridiculous, some of them.\" An image pops into my mind. \"One man tripped backward into a bowl of punch.\"\\n\\n Haymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except Effie, although even she is suppressing a smile. \"Well, it serves them right. It\u0027s their job to pay attention to you. And just because you come from District Twelve is no excuse to ignore you.\" Then her eyes dart around as if she\u0027s said something totally outrageous. \"I\u0027m sorry, but that\u0027s what I think,\" she says to no one in particular.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get a very bad score,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Scores only matter if they\u0027re very good, no one pays much attention to the bad or mediocre ones. For all they know, you could be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose. People use that strategy,\" said Portia.\\n\\n \"I hope that\u0027s how people interpret the four I\u0027ll probably get,\" says Peeta. \"If that. Really, is anything less impressive than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards. One almost landed on my foot.\"\\n\\n I grin at him and realize that I\u0027m starving. I cut off a piece of pork, dunk it in mashed potatoes, and start eating. It\u0027s okay. My family is safe. And if they are safe, no real harm has been done.\\n\\n After dinner, we go to sitting room to watch the scores announced on television. First they show a photo of the tribute, then flash their score below it. The Career Tributes naturally get in the eight-to-ten range. Most of the other players average a five. Surprisingly, little Rue comes up with a seven. I don\u0027t know what she showed the judges, but she\u0027s so tiny it must have been impressive.\\n\\n District 12 comes up last, as usual. Peeta pulls an eight so at least a couple of the Gamemakers must have been watching him. I dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up, expecting the worst. Then they\u0027re flashing the number eleven on the screen.\\n\\n Eleven!\\n\\n Effie Trinket lets out a squeal, and everybody is slapping me on the back and cheering and congratulating me. But it doesn\u0027t seem real.\\n\\n \"There must be a mistake. How. how could that happen?\" I ask Haymitch.\\n\\n \"Guess they liked your temper,\" he says. \"They\u0027ve got a show to put on. They need some players with some heat.\"\\n\\n \"Katniss, the girl who was on fire,\" says Cinna and gives me a hug. \"Oh, wait until you see your interview dress.\" \"More flames?\" I ask. \"Of a sort,\" he says mischievously.\\n\\n Peeta and I congratulate each other, another awkward moment. We\u0027ve both done well, but what does that mean for the other? I escape to my room as quickly as possible and burrow down under the covers. The stress of the day, particularly the crying, has worn me out. I drift off, reprieved, relieved, and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids.\\n\\n At dawn, I lie in bed for a while, watching the sun come up on a beautiful morning. It\u0027s Sunday. A day off at home. I wonder if Gale is in the woods yet. Usually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the week. Rising early, hunting and gathering, then trading at the Hob. I think of Gale without me. Both of us can hunt alone, but we\u0027re better as a pair. Particularly if we\u0027re trying for bigger game. But also in the littler things, having a partner lightened the load, could even make the arduous task of filling my family\u0027s table enjoyable.\\n\\n I had been struggling along on my own for about six months when I first ran into Gale in the woods. It was a Sunday in October, the air cool and pungent with dying things. I\u0027d spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting Katniss. The only meat I\u0027d shot was a squirrel that had practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns, but the animals would still be afoot when the snow buried my other food sources. Having strayed farther afield than usual, I was hurrying back home, lugging my burlap sacks when I came across a dead rabbit. It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot above my head. About fifteen yards away was another. I recognized the twitch-up snares because my father had used them. When the prey is caught, it\u0027s yanked into the air out of the reach of other hungry animals. I\u0027d been trying to use snares all summer with no success, so I couldn\u0027t help dropping my sacks to examine this one. My fingers were just on the wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out. \"That\u0027s dangerous.\"\\n\\n I jumped back several feet as Gale materialized from behind a tree. He must have been watching me the whole time. He was only fourteen, but he cleared six feet and was as good as an adult to me. I\u0027d seen him around the Seam and at school. And one other time. He\u0027d lost his father in the same blast that killed mine. In January, I\u0027d stood by while he received his medal of valor in the Justice Building, another oldest child with no father. I remembered his two little brothers clutching his mother, a woman whose swollen belly announced she was just days away from giving birth.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your name?\" he said, coming over and disengaging the rabbit from the snare. He had another three hanging from his belt.\\n\\n \"Katniss,\" I said, barely audible.\\n\\n \"Well, Catnip, stealing\u0027s punishable by death, or hadn\u0027t you heard?\" he said.\\n\\n \"Katniss,\" I said louder. \"And I wasn\u0027t stealing it. I just wanted to look at your snare. Mine never catch anything.\"\\n\\n He scowled at me, not convinced. \"So where\u0027d you get the squirrel?\"\\n\\n \"I shot it.\" I pulled my bow off my shoulder. I was still using the small version my father had made me, but I\u0027d been practicing with the full-size one when I could. I was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring down some bigger game.\\n\\n Gale\u0027s eyes fastened on the bow. \"Can I see that?\" I handed it over. \"Just remember, stealing\u0027s punishable by death.\"\\n\\n That was the first time I ever saw him smile. It transformed him from someone menacing to someone you wished you knew. But it took several months before I returned that smile.\\n\\n We talked hunting then. I told him I might be able to get him a bow if he had something to trade. Not food. I wanted knowledge. I wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day. He agreed something might be worked out. As the seasons went by, we grudgingly began to share our knowledge, our weapons, our secret places that were thick with wild plums or turkeys. He taught me snares and fishing. I showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave him one of our precious bows. And then one day, without either of us saying it, we became a team. Dividing the work and the spoils. Making sure that both our families had food.\\n\\n Gale gave me a sense of security I\u0027d lacked since my father\u0027s death. His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods. I became a much better hunter when I didn\u0027t have to look over my shoulder constantly, when someone was watching my back. But he turned into so much more than a hunting partner. He became my confidante, someone with whom I could share thoughts I could never voice inside the fence. In exchange, he trusted me with his. Being out in the woods with Gale. sometimes I was actually happy.\\n\\n I call him my friend, but in the last year it\u0027s seemed too casual a word for what Gale is to me. A pang of longing shoots through my chest. If only he was with me now! But, of course, I don\u0027t want that. I don\u0027t want him in the arena where he\u0027d be dead in a few days. I just. I just miss him. And I hate being so alone. Does he miss me? He must.\\n\\n I think of the eleven flashing under my name last night. I know exactly what he\u0027d say to me. \"Well, there\u0027s some room for improvement there.\" And then he\u0027d give me a smile and I\u0027d return it without hesitating now.\\n\\n I can\u0027t help comparing what I have with Gale to what I\u0027m pretending to have with Peeta. How I never question Gale\u0027s motives while I do nothing but doubt the latter\u0027s. It\u0027s not a fair comparison really. Gale and I were thrown together by a mutual need to survive. Peeta and I know the other\u0027s survival means our own death. How do you sidestep that?\\n\\n Effie\u0027s knocking at the door, reminding me there\u0027s another \"big, big, big day!\" ahead. Tomorrow night will be our televised interviews. I guess the whole team will have their hands full readying us for that.\\n\\n I get up and take a quick shower, being a bit more careful about the buttons I hit, and head down to the dining room. Peeta, Effie, and Haymitch are huddled around the table talking in hushed voices. That seems odd, but hunger wins out over curiosity and I load up my plate with breakfast before I join them.\\n\\n The stew\u0027s made with tender chunks of lamb and dried plums today. Perfect on the bed of wild rice. I\u0027ve shoveled about halfway through the mound when I realize no one\u0027s talking. I take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth. \"So, what\u0027s going on? You\u0027re coaching us on interviews today, right?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" says Haymitch.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to wait until I\u0027m done. I can listen and cat at the same time,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Well, there\u0027s been a change of plans. About our current approach,\" says Haymitch.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" I ask. I\u0027m not sure what our current approach is. Trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tributes is the last bit of strategy I remember.\\n\\n Haymitch shrugs. \"Peeta has asked to be coached separately.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunger-games-the-hunger-games-1/page-8.html","bookId":1685,"book":{"id":1685,"title":"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1)","description":"Storyline: The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1) \\n Winning will make you famous. \\n Losing means certain death. \\n The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts.
