{"id":63834,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"7 My slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams. The face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier Hunger Games, with my mother withdrawn and unreachable, with Prim emaciated and terrified. I bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of light. Dawn is breaking through the windows. The Capitol has a misty, haunted air. My head aches and I must have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night. My tongue probes the ragged flesh and I taste blood. Slowly, I drag myself out of bed and into the shower. I arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming hot water assault me. Then I\u0027m deluged in lemony foam that I have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush. Oh, well. At least my blood is flowing. When I\u0027m dried and moisturized with lotion, I find an outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet. Tight black pants, a long-sleeved burgundy tunic, and leather shoes. I put my hair in the single braid down my back. This is the first time since the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself. No fancy hair and clothes, no flaming capes. Just me. Looking like I could be headed for the woods. It calms me. Haymitch didn\u0027t give us an exact time to meet for breakfast and no one has contacted me this morning, but I\u0027m hungry so I head down to the dining room, hoping there will be food. I\u0027m not disappointed. While the table is empty, a long board off to the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes. A young man, an Avox, stands at attention by the spread. When I ask if I can serve myself, he nods assent. I load a plate with eggs, sausages, batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves, slices of pale purple melon. As I gorge myself, I watch the sun rise over the Capitol. I have a second plate of hot grain smothered in beef stew. Finally, I fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table, breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate, the way Peeta did on the train. My mind wanders to my mother and Prim. They must be up. My mother getting their breakfast of mush. Prim milking her goat before school. Just two mornings ago, I was home. Can that be right? Yes, just two. And now how empty the house feels, even from a distance. What did they say last night about my fiery debut at the Games? Did it give them hope, or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twenty-four tributes circled together, knowing only one could live? Haymitch and Peeta come in, bid me good morning, fill their plates. It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit I am. I need to say something to Cinna. This twins act is going to blow up in out faces once the Games begin. Surely, they must know this. Then I remember Haymitch telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. If it was anyone but Cinna, I might be tempted to ignore him. But after last night\u0027s triumph, I don\u0027t have a lot of room to criticize his choices. I\u0027m nervous about the training. There will be three days in which all the tributes practice together. On the last afternoon, we\u0027ll each get a chance to perform in private before the Gamemakers. The thought of meeting the other tributes face-to-face makes me queasy. I turn the roll I have just taken from the basket over and over in my hands, but my appetite is gone. When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, he pushes back his plate with a sigh. He takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table. \"So, let\u0027s get down to business. Training. First off, if you like, I\u0027ll coach you separately. Decide now.\" \"Why would you coach us separately?\" I ask. \"Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about,\" says Haymitch. I exchange a look with Peeta. \"I don\u0027t have any secret skills,\" he says. \"And I already know what yours is, right? I mean, I\u0027ve eaten enough of your squirrels.\" I never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I shot. Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself. Not out of greed. But because town families usually eat expensive butcher meat. Beef and chicken and horse. \"You can coach us together,\" I tell Haymitch. Peeta nods. \"All right, so give me some idea of what you can do,\" says Haymitch. \"I can\u0027t do anything,\" says Peeta. \"Unless you count baking bread.\" \"Sorry, I don\u0027t. Katniss. I already know you\u0027re handy with a knife,\" says Haymitch. \"Not really. But I can hunt,\" I say. \"With a bow and arrow.\" \"And you\u0027re good?\" asks Haymitch. I have to think about it. I\u0027ve been putting food on the table for four years. That\u0027s no small task. I\u0027m not as good as my father was, but he\u0027d had more practice. I\u0027ve better aim than Gale, but I\u0027ve had more practice. He\u0027s a genius with traps and snares. \"I\u0027m all right,\" I say. \"She\u0027s excellent,\" says Peeta. \"My father buys her squirrels. He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body. She hits every one in the eye. It\u0027s the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher. She can even bring down deer.\" This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by surprise. First, that he ever noticed. Second, that he\u0027s talking me up. \"What are you doing?\" I ask him suspiciously. \"What are you doing? If he\u0027s going to help you, he has to know what you\u0027re capable of. Don\u0027t underrate yourself,\" says Peeta. I don\u0027t know why, but this rubs me the wrong way. \"What about you? I\u0027ve seen you in the market. You can lift hundred-pound bags of flour,\" I snap at him. \"Tell him that. That\u0027s not nothing.\" \"Yes, and I\u0027m sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people. It\u0027s not like being able to use a weapon. You know it isn\u0027t,\" he shoots back. \"He can wrestle,\" I tell Haymitch. \"He came in second in our school competition last year, only after his brother.\" \"What use is that? How many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death?\" says Peeta in disgust. \"There\u0027s always hand-to-hand combat. All you need is to come up with a knife, and you\u0027ll at least stand a chance. If I get jumped, I\u0027m dead!\" I can hear my voice rising in anger. \"But you won\u0027t! You\u0027ll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows. You know what my mother said to me when she came to say good-bye, as if to cheer me up, she says maybe District Twelve will finally have a winner. Then I realized, she didn\u0027t mean me, she meant you!\" bursts out Peeta. \"Oh, she meant you,\" I say with a wave of dismissal. \"She said, \u0027She\u0027s a survivor, that one.\u0027 She is,\" says Peeta. That pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that about me? Did she rate me over her son? I see the pain in Peeta\u0027s eyes and know he isn\u0027t lying. Suddenly I\u0027m behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of the rain running down my back, the hollowness in my belly. I sound eleven years old when I speak. \"But only because someone helped me.\" Peeta\u0027s eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and I know he remembers that day, too. But he just shrugs. \"People will help you in the arena. They\u0027ll be tripping over each other to sponsor you.\" \"No more than you,\" I say. Peeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch. \"She has no idea. The effect she can have.\" He runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table, refusing to look at me. What on earth does he mean? People help me? When we were dying of starvation, no one helped me! No one except Peeta. Once I had something to barter with, things changed. I\u0027m a tough trader. Or am I? What effect do I have? That I\u0027m weak and needy? Is he suggesting that I got good deals because people pitied me? I try to think if this is true. Perhaps some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades, but I always attributed that to their long-standing relationship with my father. Besides, my game is first-class. No one pitied me! I glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me. After about a minute of this, Haymitch says, \"Well, then. Well, well, well. Katniss, there\u0027s no guarantee they\u0027ll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with the Gamemakers, show them what you can do. Until then, stay clear of archery. Are you any good at trapping?\" \"I know a few basic snares,\" I mutter. \"That may be significant in terms of food,\" says Haymitch. \"And Peeta, she\u0027s right, never underestimate strength in the arena. Very often, physical power tilts the advantage to a player. In the Training Center, they will have weights, but don\u0027t reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes. The plan\u0027s the same for both of you. You go to group training. Spend the time trying to learn something you don\u0027t know. Throw a spear. Swing a mace. Learn to tie a decent knot. Save showing what you\u0027re best at until your private sessions. Are we clear?\" says Haymitch. Peeta and I nod. \"One last thing. In public, I want you by each other\u0027s side every minute,\" says Haymitch. We both start to object, but Haymitch slams his hand on the table. \"Every minute! It\u0027s not open for discussion! You agreed to do as I said! You will be together, you will appear amiable to each other. Now get out. Meet Effie at the elevator at ten for training.\" I bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making sure Peeta can hear the door slam. I sit on the bed, hating Haymitch, hating Peeta, hating myself for mentioning that day long ago in the rain. It\u0027s such a joke! Peeta and I going along pretending to be friends! Talking up each other\u0027s strengths, insisting the other take credit for their abilities. Because, in fact, at some point, we\u0027re going to have to knock it off and accept we\u0027re bitter adversaries. Which I\u0027d be prepared to do right now if it wasn\u0027t for Haymitch\u0027s stupid instruction that we stick together in training. It\u0027s my own fault, I guess, for telling him he didn\u0027t have to coach us separately. But that didn\u0027t mean I wanted to do everything with Peeta. Who, by the way, clearly doesn\u0027t want to be partnering up with me, either. I hear Peeta\u0027s voice in my head. She has no idea. The effect she can have. Obviously meant to demean me. Right? but a tiny part of me wonders if this was a compliment. That he meant I was appealing in some way. It\u0027s weird, how much he\u0027s noticed me. Like the attention he\u0027s paid to my hunting. And apparently, I have not been as oblivious to him as I imagined, either. The flour. The wrestling. I have kept track of the boy with the bread. It\u0027s almost ten. I clean my teeth and smooth back my hair again. Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about meeting the other tributes, but now I can feel my anxiety rising again. By the time I meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator, I catch myself biting my nails. I stop at once. The actual training rooms are below ground level of our building. With these elevators, the ride is less than a minute. The doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle courses. Although it\u0027s not yet ten, we\u0027re the last ones to arrive. The other tributes are gathered in a tense circle. They each have a cloth square with their district number on it pinned to their shirts. While someone pins the number 12 on my back, I do a quick assessment. Peeta and I are the only two dressed alike. As soon as we join the circle, the head trainer, a tall, athletic woman named Atala steps up and begins to explain the training schedule. Experts in each skill will remain at their stations. We will be free to travel from area to area as we choose, per our mentor\u0027s instructions. Some of the stations teach survival skills, others fighting techniques. We are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute. There are assistants on hand if we want to practice with a partner. When Atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations, my eyes can\u0027t help flitting around to the other tributes. It\u0027s the first time we\u0027ve been assembled, on level ground, in simple clothes. My heart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than I am, even though many of the tributes have never been fed properly. You can see it in their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their eyes. I may be smaller naturally, but overall my family\u0027s resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area. I stand straight, and while I\u0027m thin, I\u0027m strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me. The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts, the volunteers, the ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment. The tributes from 1, 2, and 4 traditionally have this look about them. It\u0027s technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it happens every year. In District 12, we call them the Career Tributes, or just the Careers. And like as not, the winner will be one of them. The slight advantage I held coming into the Training Center, my fiery entrance last night, seems to vanish in the presence of my competition. The other tributes were jealous of us, but not because we were amazing, because our stylists were. Now I see nothing but contempt in the glances of the Career Tributes. Each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me. They project arrogance and brutality. When Atala releases us, they head straight for the deadliest-looking weapons in the gym and handle them with ease. I\u0027m thinking that it\u0027s lucky I\u0027m a fast runner when Peeta nudges my arm and I jump. He is still beside me, per Haymitch\u0027s instructions. His expression is sober. \"Where would you like to start?\" I look around at the Career Tributes who are showing off, clearly trying to intimidate the field. Then at the others, the underfed, the incompetent, shakily having their first lessons with a knife or an ax. \"Suppose we tie some knots,\" I say. \"Right you are,\" says Peeta. We cross to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students. You get the feeling that the knot-tying class is not the Hunger games hot spot. When he realizes I know something about snares, he shows us a simple, excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree. We concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it. Then we move on to camouflage. Peeta genuinely seems to enjoy this station, swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale skin, weaving disguises from vines and leaves. The trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work. \"I do the cakes,\" he admits to me. \"The cakes?\" I ask. I\u0027ve been preoccupied with watching the boy from District 2 send a spear through a dummy\u0027s heart from fifteen yards. \"What cakes?\" \"At home. The iced ones, for the bakery,\" he says. He means the ones they display in the windows. Fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting. They\u0027re for birthdays and New Year\u0027s Day. When we\u0027re in the square, Prim always drags me over to admire them, although we\u0027d never be able to afford one. There\u0027s little enough beauty in District 12, though, so I can hardly deny her this. I look more critically at the design on Peeta\u0027s arm. The alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods. I wonder how he knows this, since I doubt he\u0027s ever been beyond the fence. Has he been able to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his backyard? Somehow the whole thing - his skill, those inaccessible cakes, the praise of the camouflage expert - annoys me. \"It\u0027s lovely. If only you could frost someone to death,\" I say. \"Don\u0027t be so superior. You can never tell what you\u0027ll find in the arena. Say it\u0027s actually a gigantic cake - \" begins Peeta. \"Say we move on,\" I break in. So the next three days pass with Peeta and I going quietly from station to station. We do pick up some valuable skills, from starting fires, to knife throwing, to making shelter. Despite Haymitch\u0027s order to appear mediocre, Peeta excels in hand-to-hand combat, and I sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye. We steer clear of archery and weightlifting though, wanting to save those for our private sessions. The Gamemakers appeared early on the first day. Twenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple robes. They sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium, sometimes wandering about to watch us, jotting down notes, other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them, ignoring the lot of us. But they do seem to be keeping their eye on the District 12 tributes. Several times I\u0027ve looked up to find one fixated on me. They consult with the trainers during our meals as well. We see them all gathered together when we come back. Breakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at lunch the twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium. Food is arranged on carts around the room and you serve yourself. The Career Tributes tend to gather rowdily around one table, as if to prove their superiority, that they have no fear of one another and consider the rest of us beneath notice. Most of the other tributes sit alone, like lost sheep. No one says a word to us. Peeta and I eat together, and since Haymitch keeps dogging us about it, try to keep up a friendly conversation during the meals. It\u0027s not easy to find a topic. Talking of home is painful. Talking of the present unbearable. One day, Peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how they have been careful to include types from the districts along with the refined bread of the Capitol. The fish-shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from District 4. The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from District 11. Somehow, although it\u0027s made from the same stuff, it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home. \"And there you have it,\" says Peeta, scooping the breads back in the basket. \"You certainly know a lot,\" I say. \"Only about bread,\" he says. \"Okay, now laugh as if I\u0027ve said something funny.\" We both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the stares from around the room. \"All right, I\u0027ll keep smiling pleasantly and you talk,\" says Peeta. It\u0027s wearing us both out, Haymitch\u0027s direction to be friendly. Because ever since I slammed my door, there\u0027s been a chill in the air between us. But we have our orders. \"Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear?\" I ask. \"No, but it sounds fascinating,\" says Peeta. I try and animate my face as I recall the event, a true story, in which I\u0027d foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights to a beehive. Peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue. He\u0027s much better at this than I am. On the second day, while we\u0027re taking a shot at spear throwing, he whispers to me. \"I think we have a shadow.\" I throw my spear, which I\u0027m not too bad at actually, if I don\u0027t have to throw too far, and see the little girl from District 11 standing back a bit, watching us. She\u0027s the twelve-year-old, the one who reminded me so of Prim in stature. Up close she looks about ten. She has bright, dark, eyes and satiny brown skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended to her sides, as if ready to take wing at the slightest sound. It\u0027s impossible not to think of a bird. I pick up another spear while Peeta throws. \"I think her name\u0027s Rue,\" he says softly. I bite my lip. Rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the Meadow. Rue. Primrose. Neither of them could tip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet. \"What can we do about it?\" I ask him, more harshly than I intended. \"Nothing to do,\" he says back. \"Just making conversation.\" Now that I know she\u0027s there, it\u0027s hard to ignore the child. She slips up and joins us at different stations. Like me, she\u0027s clever with plants, climbs swiftly, and has good aim. She can hit the target every time with a slingshot. But what is a slingshot against a 220-pound male with a sword? Back on the District 12 floor, Haymitch and Effie grill us throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the day. What we did, who watched us, how the other tributes size up. Cinna and Portia aren\u0027t around, so there\u0027s no one to add any sanity to the meals. Not that Haymitch and Effie are fighting anymore. Instead they seem to be of one mind, determined to whip us into shape. Full of endless directions about what we should do and not do in training. Peeta is more patient, but I become fed up and surly. When we finally escape to bed on the second night, Peeta mumbles, \"Someone ought to get Haymitch a drink.\" I make a sound that is somewhere between a snort and a laugh. Then catch myself. It\u0027s messing with my mind too much, trying to keep straight when we\u0027re supposedly friends and when we\u0027re not. At least when we get into the arena, I\u0027ll know where we stand. \"Don\u0027t. Don\u0027t let\u0027s pretend when there\u0027s no one around.\" \"All right, Katniss,\" he says tiredly. After that, we only talk in front of people. On the third day of training, they start to call us out of lunch for our private sessions with the Gamemakers. District by district, first the boy, then the girl tribute. As usual, District 12 is slated to go last. We linger in the dining room, unsure where else to go. No one comes back once they have left. As the room empties, the pressure to appear friendly lightens. By the time they call Rue, we are left alone. We sit in silence until they summon Peeta. He rises. \"Remember what Haymitch said about being sure to throw the weights.\" The words come out of my mouth without permission. \"Thanks. I will,\" he says. \"You. shoot straight.\" I nod. I don\u0027t know why I said anything at all. Although if I\u0027m going to lose, I\u0027d rather Peeta win than the others. Better for our district, for my mother and Prim. After about fifteen minutes, they call my name. I smooth my hair, set my shoulders back, and walk into the gymnasium. Instantly, I know I\u0027m in trouble. They\u0027ve been here too long, the Gamemakers. Sat through twenty-three other demonstrations. Had too much to wine, most of them. Want more than anything to go home. There\u0027s nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I walk to the archery station. Oh, the weapons! I\u0027ve been itching to get my hands on them for days! Bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials I can\u0027t even name. Arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines. I choose a bow, string it, and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. There\u0027s a shooting range, but it\u0027s much too limited. Standard bull\u0027s-eyes and human silhouettes. I walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target. The dummy used for knife practice. Even as I pull back on the bow I know something is wrong. The string\u0027s tighter than the one I use at home. The arrow\u0027s more rigid. I miss the dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention I had been commanding. For a moment, I\u0027m humiliated, then I head back to the bull\u0027s-eye. I shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons. Back in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart. Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing, and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground. Without pausing, I shoulder-roll forward, come up on one knee, and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor. A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture. It\u0027s excellent shooting. I turn to the Gamemakers. A few are nodding approval, but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table. Suddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, they don\u0027t even have the decency to pay attention to me. That I\u0027m being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound, I can feel my face burning. Without thinking, I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers\u0027 table. I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. The arrow skewers the apple in the pig\u0027s mouth and pins it to the wall behind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief. \"Thank you for your consideration,\" I say. Then I give a slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without being dismissed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunger-games-the-hunger-games-1/page-7.html","bookId":1685,"book":{"id":1685,"title":"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1)","description":"Storyline: The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1) Winning will make you famous.
