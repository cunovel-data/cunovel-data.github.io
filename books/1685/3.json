I don\u0027t mean we\u0027re handcuffed or anything, but a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice Building. Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past. I\u0027ve never seen that happen though.\\n\\n Once inside, I\u0027m conducted to a room and left alone. It\u0027s the richest place I\u0027ve ever been in, with thick, deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs. I know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the stuff. When I sit on the couch, I can\u0027t help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly. It helps to calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour. The time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones. I cannot afford to get upset, to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose. Crying is not an option. There will be more cameras at the train station.\\n\\n My sister and my mother come first. I reach out to Prim and she climbs on my lap, her arms around my neck, head on my shoulder, just like she did when she was a toddler. My mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us. For a few minutes, we say nothing. Then I start telling them all the things they must remember to do, now that I will not be there to do them for them.\\n\\n Prim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by, if they\u0027re careful, on selling Prim\u0027s goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the Seam. Gale will get her the herbs she doesn\u0027t grow herself, but she must be very careful to describe them because he\u0027s not as familiar with them as I am. He\u0027ll also bring them game - he and I made a pact about this a year or so ago - and will probably not ask for compensation, but they should thank him with some kind of trade, like milk or medicine.\\n\\n I don\u0027t bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt. I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous. The woods terrified her, and whenever I shot something, she\u0027d get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough. But she makes out well with her goat, so I concentrate on that.\\n\\n When I am done with instructions about fuel, and trading, and staying in school, I turn to my mother and grip her arm, hard. \"Listen to me. Are you listening to me?\" She nods, alarmed by my intensity. She must know what\u0027s coming. \"You can\u0027t leave again,\" I say.\\n\\n My mother\u0027s eyes find the floor. \"I know. I won\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t help what - \"\\n\\n \"Well, you have to help it this time. You can\u0027t clock out and leave Prim on her own. There\u0027s no me now to keep you both alive. It doesn\u0027t matter what happens. Whatever you see on the screen. You have to promise me you\u0027ll fight through it!\" My voice has risen to a shout. In it is all the anger, all the fear I felt at her abandonment.\\n\\n She pulls her arm from my grasp, moved to anger herself now. \"I was ill. I could have treated myself if I\u0027d had the medicine I have now.\"\\n\\n That part about her being ill might be true. I\u0027ve seen her bring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since. Perhaps it is a sickness, but it\u0027s one we can\u0027t afford.\\n\\n \"Then take it. And take care of her!\" I say.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be all right, Katniss,\" says Prim, clasping my face in her hands. \"But you have to take care, too. You\u0027re so fast and brave. Maybe you can win.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t win. Prim must know that in her heart. The competition will be far beyond my abilities. Kids from wealthier districts, where winning is a huge honor, who\u0027ve been trained their whole lives for this. Boys who are two to three times my size. Girls who know twenty different ways to kill you with a knife. Oh, there\u0027ll be people like me, too. People to weed out before the real fun begins.\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" I say, because I can hardly tell my mother to carry on if I\u0027ve already given up myself. Besides, it isn\u0027t in my nature to go down without a fight, even when things seem insurmountable. \"Then we\u0027d be rich as Haymitch.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care if we\u0027re rich. I just want you to come home. You will try, won\u0027t you? Really, really try?\" asks Prim.\\n\\n \"Really, really try. I swear it,\" I say. And I know, because of Prim, I\u0027ll have to.\\n\\n And then the Peacekeeper is at the door, signaling our time is up, and we\u0027re all hugging one another so hard it hurts and all I\u0027m saying is \"I love you. I love you both.\" And they\u0027re saying it back and then the Peacekeeper orders them out and the door closes. I bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this can block the whole thing out.\\n\\n Someone else enters the room, and when I look up, I\u0027m surprised to see it\u0027s the baker, Peeta Mellark\u0027s father. I can\u0027t believe he\u0027s come to visit me. After all, I\u0027ll be trying to kill his son soon. But we do know each other a bit, and he knows Prim even better. When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob, she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return. We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife isn\u0027t around because he\u0027s so much nicer. I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread. But why has he come to see me?\\n\\n The baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush chairs. He\u0027s a big, broad-shouldered man with burn scars from years at the ovens. He must have just said goodbye to his son.\\n\\n He pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me. I open it and find cookies. These are a luxury we can never afford.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I say. The baker\u0027s not a very talkative man in the best of times, and today he has no words at all. \"I had some of your bread this morning. My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it.\" He nods, as if remembering the squirrel. \"Not your best trade,\" I say. He shrugs as if it couldn\u0027t possibly matter.\\n\\n Then I can\u0027t think of anything else, so we sit in silence until a Peacemaker summons him. He rises and coughs to clear his throat. \"I\u0027ll keep an eye on the little girl. Make sure she\u0027s eating.\"\\n\\n I feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words. People deal with me, but they are genuinely fond of Prim. Maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive.\\n\\n My next guest is also unexpected. Madge walks straight to me. She is not weepy or evasive, instead there\u0027s an urgency about her tone that surprises me. \"They let you wear one thing from your district in the arena. One thing to remind you of home. Will you wear this?\" She holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier. I hadn\u0027t paid much attention to it before, but now I see it\u0027s a small bird in flight.\\n\\n \"Your pin?\" I say. Wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind.\\n\\n \"Here, I\u0027ll put it on your dress, all right?\" Madge doesn\u0027t wait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress. \"Promise you\u0027ll wear it into the arena, Katniss?\" she asks. \"Promise?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I say. Cookies. A pin. I\u0027m getting all kinds of gifts today. Madge gives me one more. A kiss on the cheek. Then she\u0027s gone and I\u0027m left thinking that maybe Madge really has been my friend all along.\\n\\n Finally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us, but when he opens his arms I don\u0027t hesitate to go into them. His body is familiar to me - the way it moves, the smell of wood smoke, even the sound of his heart beating I know from quiet moments on a hunt - but this is the first time I really feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own.\\n\\n \"Listen,\" he says. \"Getting a knife should be pretty easy, but you\u0027ve got to get your hands on a bow. That\u0027s your best chance.\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t always have bows,\" I say, thinking of the year there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with.\\n\\n \"Then make one,\" says Gale. \"Even a weak bow is better than no bow at all.\"\\n\\n I have tried copying my father\u0027s bows with poor results. It\u0027s not that easy. Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t even know if there\u0027ll be wood,\" I say. Another year, they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes. I particularly hated that year. Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s almost always some wood,\" Gale says. \"Since that year half of them died of cold. Not much entertainment in that.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s true. We spent one Hunger Games watching the players freeze to death at night. You could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything. It was considered very anti-climactic in the Capitol, all those quiet, bloodless deaths. Since then, there\u0027s usually been wood to make fires.\\n\\n \"Yes, there\u0027s usually some,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Katniss, it\u0027s just hunting. You\u0027re the best hunter I know,\" says Gale.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not just hunting. They\u0027re armed. They think,\" I say.\\n\\n \"So do you. And you\u0027ve had more practice. Real practice,\" he says. \"You know how to kill.\"\\n\\n \"Not people,\" I say.\\n\\n \"How different can it be, really?\" says Gale grimly.\\n\\n The awful thing is that if I can forget they\u0027re people, it will be no different at all.\\n\\n The Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for more time, but they\u0027re taking him away and I start to panic. \"Don\u0027t let them starve!\" I cry out, clinging to his hand.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t! You know I won\u0027t! Katniss, remember I - \" he says, and they yank us apart and slam the door and I\u0027ll never know what it was he wanted me to remember.\\n\\n It\u0027s a short ride from the Justice Building to the train station. I\u0027ve never been in a car before. Rarely even ridden in wagons. In the Seam, we travel on foot.\\n\\n I\u0027ve been right not to cry. The station is swarming with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face. But I\u0027ve had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now. I catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall that\u0027s airing my arrival live and feel gratified that I appear almost bored.\\n\\n Peeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up. I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the Games. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out fighting. This worked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from District 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a sniveling, cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left. It turned out she could kill viciously. Pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because he\u0027s a baker\u0027s son. All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him.\\n\\n We have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the train while the cameras gobble up our images, then we\u0027re allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us. The train begins to move at once.\\n\\n The speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, I\u0027ve never been on a train, as travel between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties. For us, that\u0027s mainly transporting coal. But this is no ordinary coal train. It\u0027s one of the high-speed Capitol models that average 250 miles per hour. Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a day.\\n\\n In school, they tell us the Capitol was built in a place once called the Rockies. District 12 was in a region known is Appalachia. Even hundreds of years ago, they mined coal here. Which is why our miners have to dig so deep.\\n\\n Somehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides basic reading and math most of our instruction is coal-related. Except for the weekly lecture on the history of Panem. It\u0027s mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the Capitol. I know there must be more than they\u0027re telling us, an actual account of what happened during the rebellion. But I don\u0027t spend much time thinking about it. Whatever the truth is, I don\u0027t see how it will help me get food on the table.\\n\\n The tribute train is fancier than even the room in the Justice Building. We are each given our own chambers that have a bedroom, a dressing area, and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water. We don\u0027t have hot water at home, unless we boil it.\\n\\n There are drawers filled with fine clothes, and Effie Trinket tells me to do anything I want, wear anything I want, everything is at my disposal. Just be ready for supper in an hour. I peel off my mother\u0027s blue dress and take a hot shower. I\u0027ve never had a shower before. It\u0027s like being in a summer rain, only warmer. I dress in a dark green shirt and pants.\\n\\n At the last minute, I remember Madge\u0027s little gold pin. For the first time, I get a good look at it. It\u0027s as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips. I suddenly recognize it. A mocking jay.\\n\\n They\u0027re funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons. The common term for them was muttations, or sometimes mutts for short. One was a special bird called a jabber jay that had the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations. They were homing birds, exclusively male, that were released into regions where the Capitol\u0027s enemies were known to be hiding. After the birds gathered words, they\u0027d fly back to centers to be recorded. It took people awhile to realize what was going on in the districts, how private conversations were being transmitted. Then, of course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and the joke was on it. So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild.\\n\\n Only they didn\u0027t die off. Instead, the jabber jays mated with female mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies. They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds, from a child\u0027s high-pitched warble to a man\u0027s deep tones. And they could re-create songs. Not just a few notes, but whole songs with multiple verses, if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice.\\n\\n My father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When we went hunting, he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and, after a polite pause, they\u0027d always sing back. Not everyone is treated with such respect. But whenever my father sang, all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen. His voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time. I could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone. Still, there\u0027s something comforting about the little bird. It\u0027s like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. I fasten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a background, I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees.\\n\\n Effie Trinket comes to collect me for supper. I follow her through the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls. There\u0027s a table where all the dishes are highly breakable. Peeta Mellark sits waiting for us, the chair next to him empty.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Haymitch?\" asks Effie Trinket brightly.\\n\\n \"Last time I saw him, he said he was going to take a nap,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s been an exhausting day,\" says Effie Trinket. I think she\u0027s relieved by Haymitch\u0027s absence, and who can blame her?\\n\\n The supper comes in courses. A thick carrot soup, green salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a chocolate cake. Throughout the meal, Effie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because there\u0027s more to come. But I\u0027m stuffing myself because I\u0027ve never had food like this, so good and so much, and because probably the best thing I can do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds.\\n\\n \"At least, you two have decent manners,\" says Effie as we\u0027re finishing the main course. \"The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages. It completely upset my digestion.\"\\n\\n The pair last year were two kids from the Seam who\u0027d never, not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. And when they did have food, table manners were surely the last thing on their minds. Peeta\u0027s a baker\u0027s son. My mother taught Prim and I to eat properly, so yes, I can handle a fork and knife. But I hate Effie Trinket\u0027s comment so much I make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers. Then I wipe my hands on the tablecloth. This makes her purse her lips tightly together.\\n\\n Now that the meal\u0027s over, I\u0027m fighting to keep the food down. I can see Peeta\u0027s looking a little green, too. Neither of our stomachs is used to such rich fare. But if I can hold down Greasy Sae\u0027s concoction of mice meat, pig entrails, and tree bark - a winter specialty - I\u0027m determined to hang on to this.\\n\\n We go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reapings across Panem. They try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live, but only people in the Capitol could really do that, since none of them have to attend reapings themselves.\\n\\n One by one, we see the other reapings, the names called, (the volunteers stepping forward or, more often, not. We examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition. A few stand out in my mind. A monstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from District 2. A fox-faced girl with sleek red hair from District 5. A boy with a crippled foot from District 10. And most hauntingly, a twelve-year-old girl from District 11. She has dark brown skin and eyes, but other than that, she\u0027s very like Prim in size and demeanor. Only when she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers, all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her. There\u0027s no one willing to take her place.\\n\\n Last of all, they show District 12. Prim being called, me running forward to volunteer. You can\u0027t miss the desperation in my voice as I shove Prim behind me, as if I\u0027m afraid no one will hear and they\u0027ll take Prim away. But, of course, they do hear. I see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the stage. The commentators are not sure what to say about the crowd\u0027s refusal to applaud. The silent salute. One says that District 12 has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming. As if on cue, Haymitch falls off the stage, and they groan comically. Peeta\u0027s name is drawn, and he quietly takes his place. We shake hands. They cut to the anthem again, and the pro-gram ends.\\n\\n Effie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in. \"Your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation. A lot about televised behavior.\"\\n\\n Peeta unexpectedly laughs. \"He was drunk,\" says Peeta. \"He\u0027s drunk every year.\"\\n\\n \"Every day,\" I add. I can\u0027t help smirking a little. Effie Trinket makes it sound like Haymitch just has somewhat rough manners that could be corrected with a few tips from her.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" hisses Effie Trinket. \"How odd you two find it amusing. You know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in these Games. The one who advises you, lines up your sponsors, and dictates the presentation of any gifts. Haymitch can well be the difference between your life and your death!\"\\n\\n Just then, Haymitch staggers into the compartment. \"I miss supper?\" he says in a slurred voice. Then he vomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the mess.\\n\\n \"So laugh away!\" says Effie Trinket. She hops in her pointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the room. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunger-games-the-hunger-games-1/page-3.html","bookId":1685,"book":{"id":1685,"title":"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1)","description":"Storyline: The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1) \\n Winning will make you famous. \\n Losing means certain death. \\n The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts.
