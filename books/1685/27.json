{"id":63854,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"27 The anthem booms in my ears, and then I hear Caesar Flickerman greeting the audience. Does he know how crucial it is to get every word right from now on? He must. He will want to help us. The crowd breaks into applause as the prep teams are presented. I imagine Flavius, Venia, and Octavia bouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing bows. It\u0027s a safe bet they\u0027re clueless. Then Effie\u0027s introduced. How long she\u0027s waited for this moment. I hope she\u0027s able to enjoy it because as misguided as Effie can be, she has a very keen instinct about certain things and must at least suspect we\u0027re in trouble. Portia and Cinna receive huge cheers, of course, they\u0027ve been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. I now understand Cinna\u0027s choice of dress for me for tonight. I\u0027ll need to look as girlish and innocent as possible. Haymitch\u0027s appearance brings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes. Well, he\u0027s accomplished a first. Keeping not only one but two tributes alive. What if he hadn\u0027t warned me in time? Would I have acted differently? Flaunted the moment with the berries in the Capitol\u0027s face? No, I don\u0027t think so. But I could easily have been a lot less convincing than I need to be now. Right now. Because I can feel the plate lifting me up to the stage. Blinding lights. The deafening roar rattles the metal under my feet. Then there\u0027s Peeta just a few yards away. He looks so clean and healthy and beautiful, I can hardly recognize him. But his smile is the same whether in mud or in the Capitol and when I see it, I take about three steps and fling myself into his arms. He staggers back, almost losing his balance, and that\u0027s when I realize the slim, metal contraption in his hand is some kind of cane. He rights himself and we just cling to each other while the audience goes insane. He\u0027s kissing me and all the time I\u0027m thinking, Do you know? Do you know how much danger we\u0027re in? After about ten minutes of this, Caesar Flickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the show, and Peeta just pushes him aside without even glancing at him. The audience goes berserk. Whether he knows or not, Peeta is, as usual, playing the crowd exactly right. Finally, Haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good-natured shove toward the victor\u0027s chair. Usually, this is a single, ornate chair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the highlights of the Games, but since there are two of us, the Gamemakers have provided a plush red velvet couch. A small one, my mother would call it a love seat, I think. I sit so close to Peeta that I\u0027m practically on his lap, but one look from Haymitch tells me it isn\u0027t enough. Kicking off my sandals, I tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against Peeta\u0027s shoulder. His arm goes around me automatically, and I feel like I\u0027m back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep warm. His shirt is made of the same yellow material as my dress, but Portia\u0027s put him in long black pants. No sandals, either, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted on the stage. I wish Cinna had given me a similar outfit, I feel so vulnerable in this flimsy dress. But I guess that was the point. Caesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then it\u0027s time for the show. This will last exactly three hours and is required viewing for all of Panem. As the lights dim and the seal appears on the screen, I realize I\u0027m unprepared for this. I do not want to watch my twenty-two fellow tributes die. I saw enough of them die the first time. My heart starts pounding and I have a strong impulse to run. How have the other victors faced this alone? During the highlights, they periodically show the winner\u0027s reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen. I think back to earlier years. some are triumphant, pumping their fists in the air, beating their chests. Most just seem stunned. All I know is that the only thing keeping me on this love seat is Peeta - his arm around my shoulder, his other hand claimed by both of mine. Of course, the previous victors didn\u0027t have the Capitol looking for a way to destroy them. Condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a feat, especially when you consider how many cameras were going at once. Whoever puts together the highlights has to choose what sort of story to tell. This year, for the first time, they tell a love story. I know Peeta and I won, but a disproportionate amount of time is spent on us, right from the beginning. I\u0027m glad though, because it supports the whole crazy-in-love thing that\u0027s my defense for defying the Capitol, plus it means we won\u0027t have as much time to linger over the deaths. The first half hour or so focuses on the pre-arena events, the reaping, the chariot ride through the Capitol, our training scores, and our interviews. There\u0027s this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under it that makes it twice as awful because, of course, almost everyone on-screen is dead. Once we\u0027re in the arena, there\u0027s detailed coverage of the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us. Mostly Peeta really, there\u0027s no question he\u0027s carrying this romance thing on his shoulders. Now I see what the audience saw, how he misled the Careers about me, stayed awake the entire night under the tracker jacker tree, fought Cato to let me escape and even while he lay in that mud bank, whispered my name in his sleep. I seem heartless in comparison - dodging fireballs, dropping nests, and blowing up supplies - until I go hunting for Rue. They play her death in full, the spearing, my failed rescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from District 1\u0027s throat, Rue drawing her last breath in my arms. And the song. I get to sing every note of the song. Something inside me shuts down and I\u0027m too numb to feel anything. It\u0027s like watching complete strangers in another Hunger Games. But I do notice they omit the part where I covered her in flowers. Right. Because even that smacks of rebellion. Things pick up for me once they\u0027ve announced two tributes from the same district can live and I shout out Peeta\u0027s name and then clap my hands over my mouth. If I\u0027ve seemed indifferent to him earlier, I make up for it now, by finding him, nursing him back to health, going to the feast for the medicine, and being very free with my kisses. Objectively, I can see the mutts and Cato\u0027s death are as gruesome as ever, but again, I feel it happens to people I have never met. And then comes the moment with the berries. I can hear the audience hushing one another, not wanting to miss anything. A wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me when they end not with the announcement of our victory, but with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, screaming Peeta\u0027s name as they try to revive him. In terms of survival, it\u0027s my best moment all night. The anthem\u0027s playing yet again and we rise as President Snow himself takes the stage followed by a little girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown. There\u0027s just one crown, though, and you can hear the crowd\u0027s confusion - whose head will he place it on? - until President Snow gives it a twist and it separates into two halves. He places the first around Peeta\u0027s brow with a smile. He\u0027s still smiling when he settles the second on my head, but his eyes, just inches from mine, are as unforgiving as a snake\u0027s. That\u0027s when I know that even though both of us would have eaten the berries, I am to blame for having the idea. I\u0027m the instigator. I\u0027m the one to be punished. Much bowing and cheering follows. My arm is about to fall off from waving when Caesar Flickerman finally bids the audience good night, reminding them to tune in tomorrow for the final interviews. As if they have a choice. Peeta and I are whisked to the president\u0027s mansion for the Victory Banquet, where we have very little time to eat as Capitol officials and particularly generous sponsors elbow one another out of the way as they try to get their picture with us. Face after beaming face flashes by, becoming increasingly intoxicated as the evening wears on. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of Haymitch, which is reassuring, or President Snow, which is terrifying, but I keep laughing and thanking people and smiling as my picture is taken. The one thing I never do is let go of Peeta\u0027s hand. The sun is just peeking over the horizon when we straggle back to the twelfth floor of the Training Center. I think now I\u0027ll finally get a word alone with Peeta, but Haymitch sends him off with Portia to get something fitted for the interview and personally escorts me to my door. \"Why can\u0027t I talk to him?\" I ask. \"Plenty of time for talk when we get home,\" says Haymitch. \"Go to bed, you\u0027re on air at two.\" Despite Haymitch\u0027s running interference, I\u0027m determined to see Peeta privately. After I toss and turn for a few hours, I slip into the hall. My first thought is to check the roof, but it\u0027s empty. Even the city streets far below are deserted after the celebration last night. I go back to bed for a while and then decide to go directly to his room, but when I try to turn the knob, I find my own bedroom door has been locked from the outside. I suspect Haymitch initially, but then there\u0027s a more insidious fear that the Capitol may by monitoring and confining me. I\u0027ve been unable to escape since the Hunger Games began, but this feels different, much more personal. This feels like I\u0027ve been imprisoned for a crime and I\u0027m awaiting sentencing. I quickly get back in bed and pretend to sleep until Effie Trinket comes to alert me to the start of another \"big, big, big day!\" I have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain and stew before the prep team descends. All I have to say is, \"The crowd loved you!\" and it\u0027s unnecessary to speak for the next couple of hours. When Cinna comes in, he shoos them out and dresses me in a white, gauzy dress and pink shoes. Then he personally adjusts my makeup until I seem to radiate a soft, rosy glow. We make idle chitchat, but I\u0027m afraid to ask him anything of real importance because after the incident with the door, I can\u0027t shake the feeling that I\u0027m being watched constantly. The interview takes place right down the hall in the sitting room. A space has been cleared and the love seat has been moved in and surrounded by vases of red and pink roses. There are only a handful of cameras to record the event. No live audience at least. Caesar Flickerman gives me a warm hug when I. come in. \"Congratulations, Katniss. How are you faring?\" \"Fine. Nervous about the interview,\" I say. \"Don\u0027t be. We\u0027re going to have a fabulous time,\" he says, giving my cheek a reassuring pat. \"I\u0027m not good at talking about myself,\" I say. \"Nothing you say will be wrong,\" he says. And I think, Oh, Caesar, if only that were true. But actually, President Snow may be arranging some sort of \"accident\" for me as we speak. Then Peeta\u0027s there looking handsome in red and white, pulling me off to the side. \"I hardly get to see you. Haymitch seems bent on keeping us apart.\" Haymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive, but there are too many ears listening, so I just say, \"Yes, he\u0027s gotten very responsible lately.\" \"Well, there\u0027s just this and we go home. Then he can\u0027t watch us all the time,\" says Peeta. I feel a sort of shiver run through me and there\u0027s no time to analyze why, because they\u0027re ready for us. We sit somewhat formally on the love seat, but Caesar says, \"Oh, go ahead and curl up next to him if you want. It looked very sweet.\" So I tuck my feet up and Peeta pulls me in close to him. Someone counts backward and just like that, we\u0027re being broadcast live to the entire country. Caesar Flickerman is wonderful, teasing, joking, getting choked up when the occasion presents itself. He and Peeta already have the rapport they established that night of the first interview, that easy banter, so I just smile a lot and try to speak as little as possible. I mean, I have to talk some, but as soon as I can I redirect the conversation back to Peeta. Eventually though, Caesar begins to pose questions that insist on fuller answers. \"Well, Peeta, we know, from our days in the cave, that it was love at first sight for you from what, age five?\" Caesar says. \"From the moment I laid eyes on her,\" says Peeta. \"But, Katniss, what a ride for you. I think the real excitement for the audience was watching you fall for him. When did you realize you were in love with him?\" asks Caesar. \"Oh, that\u0027s a hard one. \" I give a faint, breathy laugh and look down at my hands. Help. \"Well, I know when it hit me. The night when you shouted out his name from that tree,\" says Caesar. Thank you, Caesar! I think, and then go with his idea. \"Yes, I guess that was it. I mean, until that point, I just tried not to think about what my feelings might be, honestly, because it was so confusing and it only made things worse if I actually cared about him. But then, in the tree, everything changed,\" I say. \"Why do you think that was?\" urges Caesar. \"Maybe. because for the first time. there was a chance I could keep him,\" I say. Behind a cameraman, I see Haymitch give a sort of huff with relief and I know I\u0027ve said the right thing. Caesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a moment because he\u0027s so moved. I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks, \"So now that you\u0027ve got me, what are you going to do with me?\" I turn in to him. \"Put you somewhere you can\u0027t get hurt.\" And when he kisses me, people in the room actually sigh. For Caesar, this is a natural place to segue into all the ways we did get hurt in the arena, from burns, to stings, to wounds. But it\u0027s not until we get around to the mutts that I forget I\u0027m on camera. When Caesar asks Peeta how his \"new leg\" is working out. \"New leg?\" I say, and I can\u0027t help reaching out and pulling up the bottom of Peeta\u0027s pants. \"Oh, no,\" I whisper, taking in the metal-and-plastic device that has replaced his flesh. \"No one told you?\" asks Caesar gently. I shake my head. \"I haven\u0027t had the chance,\" says Peeta with a slight shrug. \"It\u0027s my fault,\" I say. \"Because I used that tourniquet.\" \"Yes, it\u0027s your fault I\u0027m alive,\" says Peeta. \"He\u0027s right,\" says Caesar. \"He\u0027d have bled to death for sure without it.\" I guess this is true, but I can\u0027t help feeling upset about it to the extent that I\u0027m afraid I might cry and then I remember everyone in the country is watching me so I just bury my face in Peeta\u0027s shirt. It takes them a couple of minutes to coax me back out because it\u0027s better in the shirt, where no one can see me, and when I do come out, Caesar backs off questioning me so I can recover. In fact, he pretty much leaves me alone until the berries come up. \"Katniss, I know you\u0027ve had a shock, but I\u0027ve got to ask. The moment when you pulled out those berries. What was going on in your mind. hm?\" he says. I take a long pause before I answer, trying to collect my thoughts. This is the crucial moment where I either challenged the Capitol or went so crazy at the idea of losing Peeta that I can\u0027t be held responsible for my actions. It seems to call for a big, dramatic speech, but all I get out is one almost inaudible sentence. \"I don\u0027t know, I just. couldn\u0027t bear the thought of. being without him.\" \"Peeta? Anything to add?\" asks Caesar. \"No. I think that goes for both of us,\" he says. Caesar signs off and it\u0027s over. Everyone\u0027s laughing and crying and hugging, but I\u0027m still not sure until I reach Haymitch. \"Okay?\" I whisper. \"Perfect,\" he answers. I go back to my room to collect a few things and find there\u0027s nothing to take but the mockingjay pin Madge gave me. Someone returned it to my room after the Games. They drive us through the streets in a car with blackened windows, and the train\u0027s waiting for us. We barely have time to say good-bye to Cinna and Portia, although we\u0027ll see them in a few months, when we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies. It\u0027s the Capitol\u0027s way of reminding people that the Hunger Games never really go away. We\u0027ll be given a lot of useless plaques, and everyone will have to pretend they love us. The train begins moving and we\u0027re plunged into night until we clear the tunnel and I take my first free breath since the reaping. Effie is accompanying us back and Haymitch, too, of course. We eat an enormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the television to watch a replay of the interview. With the Capitol growing farther away every second, I begin to think of home. Of Prim and my mother. Of Gale. I excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants. As I slowly, thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and put my hair in its braid, I begin transforming back into myself. Katniss Everdeen. A girl who lives in the Seam. Hunts in the woods. Trades in the Hob. I stare in the mirror as I try to remember who I am and who I am not. By the time I join the others, the pressure of Peeta\u0027s arm around my shoulders feels alien. When the train makes a brief stop for fuel, we\u0027re allowed to go outside for some fresh air. There\u0027s no longer any need to guard us. Peeta and I walk down along the track, hand in hand, and I can\u0027t find anything to say now that we\u0027re alone. He stops to gather a bunch of wildflowers for me. When he presents them, I work hard to look pleased. Because he can\u0027t know that the pink-and-white flowers are the tops of wild onions and only remind me of the hours I\u0027ve spent gathering them with Gale. Gale. The idea of seeing Gale in a matter of hours makes my stomach churn. But why? I can\u0027t quite frame it in my mind. I only know that I feel like I\u0027ve been lying to someone who trusts me. Or more accurately, to two people. I\u0027ve been getting away with it up to this point because of the Games. But there will be no Games to hide behind back home. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Peeta asks. \"Nothing,\" I answer. We continue walking, past the end of the train, out where even I\u0027m fairly sure there are no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along the track. Still no words come. Haymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my back. Even now, in the middle of nowhere, he keeps his voice down. \"Great job, you two. Just keep it up in the district until the cameras are gone. We should be okay.\" I watch him head back to the train, avoiding Peeta\u0027s eyes. \"What\u0027s he mean?\" Peeta asks me. \"It\u0027s the Capitol. They didn\u0027t like our stunt with the berries,\" I blurt out. \"What? What are you talking about?\" he says. \"It seemed too rebellious. So, Haymitch has been coaching me through the last few days. So I didn\u0027t make it worse,\" I say. \"Coaching you? But not me,\" says Peeta. \"He knew you were smart enough to get it right,\" I say. \"I didn\u0027t know there was anything to get right,\" says Peeta. \"So, what you\u0027re saying is, these last few days and then I guess. back in the arena. that was just some strategy you two worked out.\" \"No. I mean, I couldn\u0027t even talk to him in the arena, could I?\" I stammer. \"But you knew what he wanted you to do, didn\u0027t you?\" says Peeta. I bite my lip. \"Katniss?\" He drops my hand and I take a step, as if to catch my balance. \"It was all for the Games,\" Peeta says. \"How you acted.\" \"Not all of it,\" I say, tightly holding onto my flowers. \"Then how much? No, forget that. I guess the real question is what\u0027s going to be left when we get home?\" he says. \"I don\u0027t know. The closer we get to District Twelve, the more confused I get,\" I say. He waits, for further explanation, but none\u0027s forthcoming. \"Well, let me know when you work it out,\" he says, and the pain in his voice is palpable. I know my ears are healed because, even with the rumble of the engine, I can hear every step he takes back to the train. By the time I\u0027ve climbed aboard, Peeta has disappiared into his room for the night. I don\u0027t see him the next morning, either. In fact, the next time he turns up, we\u0027re pulling into District 12. He gives me a nod, his face expressionless. I want to tell him that he\u0027s not being fair. That we were strangers. That I did what it took to stay alive, to keep us both alive in the arena. That I can\u0027t explain how things are with Gale because I don\u0027t know myself. That it\u0027s no good loving me because I\u0027m never going to get married anyway and he\u0027d just end up hating me later instead of sooner. That if I do have feelings for him, it doesn\u0027t matter because I\u0027ll never be able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family, to children. And how can he? How can he after what we\u0027ve just been through? I also want to tell him how much I already miss him. But that wouldn\u0027t be fair on my part. So we just stand there silently, watching our grimy little station rise up around us. Through the window, I can see the platform\u0027s thick with cameras. Everyone will be eagerly watching our homecoming. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Peeta extend his hand. I look at him, unsure. \"One more time? For the audience?\" he says. His voice isn\u0027t angry. It\u0027s hollow, which is worse. Already the boy with the bread is slipping away from me. I take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras, and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let go.
