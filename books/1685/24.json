How Foxface stole the food from the supply pile before I blew it up, how she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that anyone would notice it, how she wouldn\u0027t question the safety of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves.\\n\\n \"I wonder how she found us,\" says Peeta. \"My fault, I guess, if I\u0027m as loud as you say.\"\\n\\n We were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, but I try to be kind. \"And she\u0027s very clever, Peeta. Well, she was. Until you outfoxed her.\"\\n\\n \"Not on purpose. Doesn\u0027t seem fair somehow. I mean, we would have both been dead, too, if she hadn\u0027t eaten the berries first.\" He checks himself. \"No, of course, we wouldn\u0027t. You recognized them, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n I give a nod. \"We call them nightlock.\"\\n\\n \"Even the name sounds deadly,\" he says. \"I\u0027m sorry, Katniss. I really thought they were the same ones you\u0027d gathered.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t apologize. It just means we\u0027re one step closer to home, right?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get rid of the rest,\" Peeta says. He gathers up the sheet of blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, and goes to toss them into the woods.\\n\\n \"Wait!\" I cry. I find the leather pouch that belonged to the boy from District 1 and fill it with a few handfuls of berries from the plastic. \"If they fooled Foxface, maybe they can fool Cato as well. If he\u0027s chasing us or something, we can act like we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them - \"\\n\\n \"Then hello District Twelve,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it,\" I say, securing the pouch to my belt.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll know where we are now,\" says Peeta. \"If he was anywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft, he\u0027ll know we killed her and come after us.\"\\n\\n Peeta\u0027s right. This could be just the opportunity Cato\u0027s been waiting for. But even if we run now, there\u0027s the meat to cook and our fire will be another sign of our whereabouts. \"Let\u0027s make a fire. Right now.\" I begin to gather branches and brush.\\n\\n \"Are you ready to face him?\" Peeta asks.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ready to eat. Better to cook our food while we have the chance. If he knows we\u0027re here, he knows. But he also knows there\u0027s two of us and probably assumes we were hunting Foxface. That means you\u0027re recovered. And the fire means we\u0027re not hiding, we\u0027re inviting him here. Would you show up?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Maybe not,\" he says.\\n\\n Peeta\u0027s a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the damp wood. In no time, I have the rabbits and squirrel roasting, the roots, wrapped in leaves, baking in the coals. We take turns gathering greens and keeping a careful watch for Cato, but as I anticipated, he doesn\u0027t make an appearance.\\n\\n When the food\u0027s cooked, I pack most of it up, leaving us each a rabbit\u0027s leg to eat as we walk.\\n\\n I want to move higher into the woods, climb a good tree, and make camp for the night, but Peeta resists. \"I can\u0027t climb like you, Katniss, especially with my leg, and I don\u0027t think I could ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not safe to stay in the open, Peeta,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t we go back to the cave?\" he asks. \"It\u0027s near water and easy to defend.\"\\n\\n I sigh. Several more hours of walking - or should I say crashing - through the woods to reach an area we\u0027ll just have to leave in the morning to hunt. But Peeta doesn\u0027t ask for much. He\u0027s followed my instructions all day and I\u0027m sure if things were reversed, he wouldn\u0027t make me spend the night in a tree. It dawns on me that I haven\u0027t been very nice to Peeta today. Nagging him about how loud he was, screaming at him over disappearing. The playful romance we had sustained in the cave has disappeared out in the open, under the hot sun, with the threat of Cato looming over us. Haymitch has probably just about had it with me. And as for the audience.\\n\\n I reach up and give him a kiss. \"Sure. Let\u0027s go back to the cave.\"\\n\\n He looks pleased and relieved. \"Well, that was easy.\"\\n\\n I work my arrow out of the oak, careful not to damage the shaft. These arrows are food, safety, and life itself now.\\n\\n We toss a bunch more wood on the fire. It should be sending off smoke for a few more hours, although I doubt Cato assumes anything at this point. When we reach the stream, I see the water has dropped considerably and moves at its old leisurely pace, so I suggest we walk back in it. Peeta\u0027s happy to oblige and since he\u0027s a lot quieter in water than on land, it\u0027s a doubly good idea. It\u0027s a long walk back to the cave though, even going downward, even with the rabbit to give us a boost. We\u0027re both exhausted by our hike today and still way too underfed. I keep my bow loaded, both for Cato and any fish I might see, but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures.\\n\\n By the time we reach our destination, our feet are dragging and the sun sits low on the horizon. We fill up our water bottles and climb the little slope to our den. It\u0027s not much, but out here in the wilderness, it\u0027s the closest thing we have to a home. It will be warmer than a tree, too, because it provides some shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from the west. I set a good dinner out, but halfway through Peeta begins to nod off. After days of inactivity, the hunt has taken its toll. I order him into the sleeping bag and set aside the rest of his food for when he wakes. He drops off immediately. I pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead, not for the audience, but for me. Because I\u0027m so grateful that he\u0027s still here, not dead by the stream as I\u0027d thought. So glad that I don\u0027t have to face Cato alone.\\n\\n Brutal, bloody Cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his arm, who had the power to overcome Thresh, who has had it out for me since the beginning. He probably has had a special hatred for me ever since I outscored him in training. A boy like Peeta would simply shrug that off. But I have a feeling it drove Cato to distraction. Which is not that hard. I think of his ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up. The others were upset, of course, but he was completely unhinged. I wonder now if Cato might not be entirely sane.\\n\\n The sky lights up with the seal, and I watch Foxface shine in the sky and then disappear from the world forever. He hasn\u0027t said it, but I don\u0027t think Peeta felt good about killing her, even if it was essential. I can\u0027t pretend I\u0027ll miss her, but I have to admire her. My guess is if they had given us some sort of test, she would have been the smartest of all the tributes. If, in fact, we had been setting a trap for her, I bet she\u0027d have sensed it and avoided the berries. It was Peeta\u0027s own ignorance that brought her down. I\u0027ve spent so much time making sure I don\u0027t underestimate my opponents that I\u0027ve forgotten it\u0027s just as dangerous to overestimate them as well.\\n\\n That brings me back to Cato. But while I think I had a sense of Foxface, who she was and how she operated, he\u0027s a little more slippery. Powerful, well trained, but smart? I don\u0027t know. Not like she was. And utterly lacking in the control Foxface demonstrated. I believe Cato could easily lose his judgment in a fit of temper. Not that I can feel superior on that point. I think of the moment I sent the arrow flying into the apple in the pig\u0027s mouth when I was so enraged. Maybe I do understand Cato better than I think.\\n\\n Despite the fatigue in my body, my mind\u0027s alert, so I let Peeta sleep long past our usual switch. In fact, a soft gray day has begun when I shake his shoulder. He looks out, almost in alarm. \"I slept the whole night. That\u0027s not fair, Katniss, you should have woken me.\"\\n\\n I stretch and burrow down into the bag. \"I\u0027ll sleep now. Wake me if anything interesting happens.\"\\n\\n Apparently nothing does, because when I open my eyes, bright hot afternoon light gleams through the rocks. \"Any sign of our friend?\" I ask.\\n\\n Peeta shakes his head. \"No, he\u0027s keeping a disturbingly low profile.\"\\n\\n \"How long do you think we\u0027ll have before the Gamemakers drive us together?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Well, Foxface died almost a day ago, so there\u0027s been plenty of time for the audience to place bets and get bored. I guess it could happen at any moment,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I have a feeling today\u0027s the day,\" I say. I sit up and look out at the peaceful terrain. \"I wonder how they\u0027ll do it.\"\\n\\n Peeta remains silent. There\u0027s not really any good answer.\\n\\n \"Well, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting day. But we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we run into trouble,\" I say.\\n\\n Peeta packs up our gear while I lay out a big meal. The rest of the rabbits, roots, greens, the rolls spread with the last bit of cheese. The only thing I leave in reserve is the squirrel and the apple.\\n\\n By the time we\u0027re done, all that\u0027s left is a pile of rabbit bones. My hands are greasy, which only adds to my growing feeling of grubbiness. Maybe we don\u0027t bathe daily in the Seam, but we keep cleaner than I have of late. Except for my feet, which have walked in the stream, I\u0027m covered in a layer of grime.\\n\\n Leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it. I don\u0027t think there will be another night in the arena somehow. One way or the other, dead or alive, I have the feeling I\u0027ll escape it today. I give the rocks a pat good-bye and we head down to the stream to wash up. I can feel my skin, itching for the cool water. I may do my hair and braid it back wet. I\u0027m wondering if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub when we reach the stream. Or what used to be the stream. Now there\u0027s only a bone-dry bed. I put my hand down to feel it.\\n\\n \"Not even a little damp. They must have drained it while we slept,\" I say. A fear of the cracked tongue, aching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my previous dehydration creeps into my consciousness. Our bottles and skin are fairly full, but with two drinking and this hot sun it won\u0027t take long to deplete them.\\n\\n \"The lake,\" says Peeta. \"That\u0027s where they want us to go.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe the ponds still have some,\" I say hopefully.\\n\\n \"We can check,\" he says, but he\u0027s just humoring me. I\u0027m humoring myself because I know what I\u0027ll find when we return to the pond where I soaked my leg. A dusty, gaping mouth of a hole. But we make the trip anyway just to confirm what we already know.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right. They\u0027re driving us to the lake,\" I say. Where there\u0027s no cover. Where they\u0027re guaranteed a bloody fight to the death with nothing to block their view. \"Do you want to go straightaway or wait until the water\u0027s tapped out?\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go now, while we\u0027ve had food and rest. Let\u0027s just go end this thing,\" he says.\\n\\n I nod. It\u0027s funny. I feel almost as if it\u0027s the first day of the Games again. That I\u0027m in the same position. Twenty-one tributes are dead, but I still have yet to kill Cato. And really, wasn\u0027t he always the one to kill? Now it seems the other tributes were just minor obstacles, distractions, keeping us from the real battle of the Games. Cato and me.\\n\\n But no, there\u0027s the boy waiting beside me. I feel his arms wrap around me.\\n\\n \"Two against one. Should be a piece of cake,\" he says.\\n\\n \"Next time we eat, it will be in the Capitol,\" I answer.\\n\\n \"You bet it will,\" he says.\\n\\n We stand there a while, locked in an embrace, feeling each other, the sunlight, the rustle of the leaves at our feet. Then without a word, we break apart and head for the lake.\\n\\n I don\u0027t care now that Peeta\u0027s footfalls send rodents scurrying, make birds take wing. We have to fight Cato and I\u0027d just as soon do it here as on the plain. But I doubt I\u0027ll have that choice. If the Gamemakers want us in the open, then in the open we will be.\\n\\n We stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where the Careers trapped me. The husk of the tracker jacker nest, beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning sun, confirms the location. I touch it with the tip of my boot, and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the breeze. I can\u0027t help looking up in the tree where Rue secretly perched, waiting to save my life. Tracker jackers. Glimmer\u0027s bloated body. The terrifying hallucinations.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s move on,\" I say, wanting to escape the darkness that surrounds this place. Peeta doesn\u0027t object.\\n\\n Given our late start to the day, when we reach the plain it\u0027s already early evening. There\u0027s no sign of Cato. No sign of anything except the gold Cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun rays. Just in case Cato decided to pull a Foxface on us, we circle the Cornucopia to make sure it\u0027s empty. Then obediently, as if following instructions, we cross to the lake and fill our water containers.\\n\\n I frown at the shrinking sun. \"We don\u0027t want to fight him after dark. There\u0027s only the one pair of glasses.\"\\n\\n Peeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the water. \"Maybe that\u0027s what he\u0027s waiting for. What do you want to do? Go back to the cave?\"\\n\\n \"Either that or find a tree. But let\u0027s give him another half an hour or so. Then we\u0027ll take cover,\" I answer.\\n\\n We sit by the lake, in full sight. There\u0027s no point in hiding now. In the trees at the edge of the plain, I can see the mockingjays flitting about. Bouncing melodies back and forth between them like brightly colored balls. I open my mouth and sing out Rue\u0027s four-note run. I can feel them pause curiously at the sound of my voice, listening for more. I repeat the notes in the silence. First one mockingjay trills the tune back, then another. Then the whole world comes alive with the sound.\\n\\n \"Just like your father,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n My fingers find the pin on my shirt. \"That\u0027s Rue\u0027s song,\" I say. \"I think they remember it.\"\\n\\n The music swells and I recognize the brilliance of it. As the notes overlap, they compliment one another, forming a lovely, unearthly harmony. It was this sound then, thanks to Rue, that sent the orchard workers of District 11 home each night. Does someone start it at quitting time, I wonder, now that she is dead?\\n\\n For a while, I just close my eyes and listen, mesmerized by the beauty of the song. Then something begins to disrupt the music. Runs cut off in jagged, imperfect lines. Dissonant notes intersperse with the melody. The mockingjays\u0027 voices rise up in a shrieking cry of alarm.\\n\\n We\u0027re on our feet, Peeta wielding his knife, me poised to shoot, when Cato smashes through the trees and bears down on us. He has no spear. In fact, his hands are empty, yet he runs straight for us. My first arrow hits his chest and inexplicably falls aside.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got some kind of body armor!\" I shout to Peeta.\\n\\n Just in time, too, because Cato is upon us. I brace myself, but he rockets right between us with no attempt to check his speed. I can tell from his panting, the sweat pouring off his purplish face, that he\u0027s been running hard a long time. Not toward us. From something. But what?\\n\\n My eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first creature leap onto the plain. As I\u0027m turning away, I see another half dozen join it. Then I am stumbling blindly after Cato with no thought of anything but to save myself. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunger-games-the-hunger-games-1/page-24.html","bookId":1685,"book":{"id":1685,"title":"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1)","description":"Storyline: The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1) \\n Winning will make you famous. \\n Losing means certain death. \\n The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts.
