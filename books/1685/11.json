{"id":63838,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"11\n Sixty seconds. That\u0027s how long we\u0027re required to stand on our metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us. Step off before the minute is up, and land mines blow your legs off. Sixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant from the Cornucopia, a giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved tail, the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high, spilling over with the things that will give us life here in the arena. Food, containers of water, weapons, medicine, garments, fire starters. Strewn around the Cornucopia are other supplies, their value decreasing the farther they are from the horn. For instance, only a few steps from my feet lays a three-foot square of plastic. Certainly it could be of some use in a downpour. But there in the mouth, I can see a tent pack that would protect from almost any sort of weather. If I had the guts to go in and fight for it against the other twenty-three tributes. Which I have been instructed not to do.\n We\u0027re on a flat, open stretch of ground. A plain of hard-packed dirt. Behind the tributes across from me, I can see nothing, indicating either a steep downward slope or even cliff. To my right lies a lake. To my left and back, spars piney woods. This is where Haymitch would want me to go. Immediately.\n I hear his instructions in my head. \"Just clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others, and find a source of water.\"\n But it\u0027s tempting, so tempting, when I see the bounty waiting there before me. And I know that if I don\u0027t get it, someone else will. That the Career Tributes who survive the bloodbath will divide up most of these life-sustaining spoils. Something catches my eye. There, resting on a mound of blanket rolls, is a silver sheath of arrows and a bow, already strung, just waiting to be engaged. That\u0027s mine, I think. It\u0027s meant for me.\n I\u0027m fast. I can sprint faster than any of the girls in our school although a couple can beat me in distance races. But this forty-yard length, this is what I am built for. I know I can get it, I know I can reach it first, but then the question is how quickly can I get out of there? By the time I\u0027ve scrambled up the packs and grabbed the weapons, others will have reached the horn, and one or two I might be able to pick off, but say there\u0027s a dozen, at that close range, they could take me down with the spears and the clubs. Or their own powerful fists.\n Still, I won\u0027t be the only target. I\u0027m betting many of the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl, even one who scored an eleven in training, to take out their more fierce adversaries.\n Haymitch has never seen me run. Maybe if he had he\u0027d tell me to go for it. Get the weapon. Since that\u0027s the very weapon that might be my salvation. And I only see one bow in that whole pile. I know the minute must be almost up and will have to decide what my strategy will be and I find myself positioning my feet to run, not away into the stir rounding forests but toward the pile, toward the bow. When suddenly I notice Peeta, he\u0027s about five tributes to my right, quite a fair distance, still I can tell he\u0027s looking at me and I think he might be shaking his head. But the sun\u0027s in my eyes, and while I\u0027m puzzling over it the gong rings out.\n And I\u0027ve missed it! I\u0027ve missed my chance! Because those extra couple of seconds I\u0027ve lost by not being ready are enough to change my mind about going in. My feet shuffle for a moment, confused at the direction my brain wants to take and then I lunge forward, scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of bread. The pickings are so small and I\u0027m so angry with Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because I can\u0027t stand leaving with virtually nothing.\n A boy, I think from District 9, reaches the pack at the same time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he coughs, splattering my face with blood. I stagger back, repulsed by the warm, sticky spray. Then the boy slips to the ground. That\u0027s when I see the knife in his back. Already other tributes have reached the Cornucopia and are spreading out to attack. Yes, the girl from District 2, ten yards away, running toward me, one hand clutching a half-dozen knives. I\u0027ve seen her throw in training. She never misses. And I\u0027m her next target.\n All the general fear I\u0027ve been feeling condenses into at immediate fear of this girl, this predator who might kill me in seconds. Adrenaline shoots through me and I sling the pack over one shoulder and run full-speed for the woods. I can hear the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my head. The blade lodges in the pack. Both straps on my shoulders now, I make for the trees. Somehow I know the girl will not pursue me. That she\u0027ll be drawn back into the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is gone. A grin crosses my face. Thanks for the knife, I think.\n At the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to survey the field. About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one another at the horn. Several lie dead already on the ground. Those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void opposite me. I continue running until the woods have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a steady jog that I think I can maintain for a while. For the next few hours, I alternate between jogging and walking, putting as much distance as I can between myself and my competitors. I lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District 9 but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold it neatly and tuck it into a pocket. I also free the knife - it\u0027s a fine one with a long sharp blade, serrated near the handle, which will make it handy for sawing through things - and slide it into my belt. I don\u0027t dare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet. I just keep moving, pausing only to check for pursuers.\n I can go a long time. I know that from my days in the woods. But I will need water. That was Haymitch\u0027s second instruction, and since I sort of botched the first, I keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it. No luck.\n The woods begin to evolve, and the pines are intermixed with a variety of trees, some I recognize, some completely foreign to me. At one point, I hear a noise and pull my knife, thinking I may have to defend myself, but I\u0027ve only startled a rabbit. \"Good to see you,\" I whisper. If there\u0027s one rabbit, there could be hundreds just waiting to be snared.\n The ground slopes down. I don\u0027t particularly like this. Valleys make me feel trapped. I want to be high, like in the hills around District 12, where I can see my enemies approaching. But I have no choice but to keep going.\n Funny though, I don\u0027t feel too bad. The days of gorging myself have paid off. I\u0027ve got staying power even though I\u0027m short on sleep. Being in the woods is rejuvenating. I\u0027m glad for the solitude, even though it\u0027s an illusion, because I\u0027m probably on-screen right now. Not consistently but off and on. There are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekking through the woods isn\u0027t much to look at. But they\u0027ll show me enough to let people know I\u0027m alive, uninjured and on the move. One of the heaviest days of betting is the opening, when the initial casualties come in. But that can\u0027t compare to what happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players.\n It\u0027s late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons. Each shot represents a dead tribute. The fighting must have finally stopped at the Cornucopia. They never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers have dispersed. On the opening day, they don\u0027t even fire the cannons until the initial fighting\u0027s over because it\u0027s too hard to keep track of the fatalities. I allow myself to pause, panting, as I count the shots. One. two. three. on and on until they reach eleven. Eleven dead in all. Thirteen left to play. My fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from District 9 coughed into my face. He\u0027s gone, certainly. I wonder about Peeta. Has he lasted through the day? I\u0027ll know in a few hours. When they project the dead\u0027s images into the sky for the rest of us to see.\n All of a sudden, I\u0027m overwhelmed by the thought that Peeta may be already lost, bled white, collected, and in the process of being transported back to the Capitol to be cleaned up, redressed, and shipped in a simple wooden box back to District 12. No longer here. Heading home. I try hard to remember if I saw him once the action started. But the last image I can conjure up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang out.\n Maybe it\u0027s better, if he\u0027s gone already. He had no confidence he could win. And I will not end up with the unpleasant task of killing him. Maybe it\u0027s better if he\u0027s out of this for good.\n I slump down next to my pack, exhausted. I need to go through it anyway before night falls. See what I have to work with. As I unhook the straps, I can feel it\u0027s sturdily made although a rather unfortunate color. This orange will practically glow in the dark. I make a mental note to camouflage it first thing tomorrow.\n I flip open the flap. What I want most, right at this moment, is water. Haymitch\u0027s directive to immediately find water was not arbitrary. I won\u0027t last long without it. For a few days, I\u0027ll be able to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration, but after that I\u0027ll deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a week, tops. I carefully lay out the provisions. One thin black sleeping bag that reflects body heal. A pack of crackers. A pack of dried beef strips. A bottle of iodine. A box of wooden matches. A small coil of wire. A pair of sunglasses. And a half-gallon plastic bottle with a cap for carrying water that\u0027s bone dry.\n No water. How hard would it have been for them to fill up the bottle? I become aware of the dryness in my throat and mouth, the cracks in my lips. I\u0027ve been moving all day long. It\u0027s been hot and I\u0027ve sweat a lot. I do this at home, but there are always streams to drink from, or snow to melt if it should come to it.\n As I refill my pack I have an awful thought. The lake. The one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound. What if that\u0027s the only water source in the arena? That way they\u0027ll guarantee drawing us in to fight. The lake is a full day\u0027s journey from where I sit now, a much harder journey with nothing to drink. And then, even if I reach it, it\u0027s sure to be heavily guarded by some of the Career Tributes. I\u0027m about to panic when I remember the rabbit I startled earlier today. It has to drink, too. I just have to find out where.\n Twilight is closing in and I am ill at ease. The trees are too thin to offer much concealment. The layer of pine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes tracking animals harder when I need their trails to find water. And I\u0027m still heading downhill, deeper and deeper into a valley that seems endless.\n I\u0027m hungry, too, but I don\u0027t dare break into my precious store of crackers and beef yet. Instead, I take my knife and go to work on a pine tree, cutting away the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the softer inner bark. I slowly chew the stuff as I walk along. After a week of the finest food in the world, it\u0027s a little hard to choke down. But I\u0027ve eaten plenty of pine in my life. I\u0027ll adjust quickly.\n In another hour, it\u0027s clear I\u0027ve got to find a place to camp. Night creatures are coming out. I can hear the occasional hoot or howl, my first clue that I\u0027ll be competing with natural predators for the rabbits. As to whether I\u0027ll be viewed as a source of food, it\u0027s too soon to tell. There could be any number of animals stalking me at this moment.\n But right now, I decide to make my fellow tributes a priority. I\u0027m sure many will continue hunting through the night. Those who fought it out at the Cornucopia will have food, an abundance of water from the lake, torches or flashlights, and weapons they\u0027re itching to use. I can only hope I\u0027ve traveled far and fast enough to be out of range.\n Before settling down, I take my wire and set two twitch-up snares in the brush. I know it\u0027s risky to be setting traps, but food will go so fast out here. And I can\u0027t set snares on the run. Still, I walk another five minutes before making camp.\n I pick my tree carefully. A willow, not terribly tall but set in a clump of other willows, offering concealment in those long, flowing tresses. I climb up, sticking to the stronger branches close to the trunk, and find a sturdy fork for my bed. It takes some doing, but I arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable manner. I place my backpack in the foot of the bag, then slide in after it. As a precaution, I remove my belt, loop it all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag, and refasten it at my waist. Now if I roll over in my sleep, I won\u0027t go crashing to the ground. I\u0027m small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my head, but I put on my hood as well. As night falls, the air is cooling quickly. Despite the risk I took in getting the backpack, I know now it was the right choice. This sleeping bag, radiating back and preserving my body heat, will be invaluable. I\u0027m sure there are several other tributes whose biggest concern right now is how to stay warm whereas I may actually be able to get a few hours of sleep. If only I wasn\u0027t so thirsty.\n Night has just come when I hear the anthem that proceeds the death recap. Through the branches I can see the seal of the Capitol, which appears to be floating in the sky. I\u0027m actually viewing another screen, an enormous one that\u0027s transported by of one of their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home, we would be watching full coverage of each and every killing, but that\u0027s thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes. For instance, if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone, my secret would be revealed to all. No, here in the arena, all we see are the same photographs they showed when they televised our training scores. Simple head shots. But now instead of scores they post only district numbers. I take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my fingers.\n The first to appear is the girl from District 3. That means that the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all survived. No surprise there. Then the boy from 4. I didn\u0027t expect that one, usually all the Careers make it through the first day. The boy from District 5. I guess the fox-faced girl made it. Both tributes from 6 and 7. The boy from 8. Both from 9. Yes, there\u0027s the boy who I fought for the backpack. I\u0027ve run through my fingers, only one more dead tribute to go. Is it Peeta? No, there\u0027s the girl from District 10. That\u0027s it. The Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish. Then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume.\n I\u0027m relieved Peeta\u0027s alive. I tell myself again that if I get killed, his winning will benefit my mother and Prim the most. This is what I tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when I think of Peeta. The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. The anger at his superiority on the roof. The dread that we may come face-to-face at any moment in this arena.\n Eleven dead, but none from District 12. I try to work out who is left. Five Career Tributes. Foxface. Thresh and Rue. Rue. so she made it through the first day after all. I can\u0027t help feeling glad. That makes ten of us. The other three I\u0027ll figure out tomorrow. Now when it is dark, and I have traveled far, and I am nestled high in this tree, now I must try and rest.\n I haven\u0027t really slept in two days, and then there\u0027s been the long day\u0027s journey into the arena. Slowly, I allow my muscles to relax. My eyes to close. The last thing I think is it\u0027s lucky I don\u0027t snore.\n Snap! The sound of a breaking branch wakes me. How long have I been asleep? Four hours? Five? The tip of my nose is icy cold. Snap! Snap! What\u0027s going on? This is not the sound of a branch under someone\u0027s foot, but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree. Snap! Snap! I judge it to be several hundred yards to my right. Slowly, noiselessly, I turn myself in that direction. For a few minutes, there\u0027s nothing but blackness and some scuffling. Then I see a spark and a small fire begins to bloom. A pair of hands warms over flames, but I can\u0027t make out more than that.\n I have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I know at the fire starter. What are they thinking? A fire I\u0027ll just at nightfall would have been one thing. Those who battled at the Cornucopia, with their superior strength and surplus of supplies, they couldn\u0027t possibly have been near enough to spot the flames then. But now, when they\u0027ve probably been combing the woods for hours looking for victims. You might as well be waving a flag and shouting, \"Come and get me!\"\n And here I am a stone\u0027s throw from the biggest idiot in the Games. Strapped in a tree. Not daring to flee since my general location has just been broadcast to any killer who cares. I mean, I know it\u0027s cold out here and not everybody has a sleeping bag. But then you grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn!\n I lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours really thinking that if I can get out of this tree, I won\u0027t have the least problem taking out my new neighbor. My instinct has been to flee, not fight. But obviously this person\u0027s a hazard. Stupid people are dangerous. And this one probably doesn\u0027t have much in the way of weapons while I\u0027ve got this excellent knife.\n The sky is still dark, but I can feel the first signs of dawn approaching. I\u0027m beginning to think we - meaning the person whose death I\u0027m now devising and me - we might actually have gone unnoticed. Then I hear it. Several pairs of feet breaking into a run. The fire starter must have dozed off. They\u0027re on her before she can escape. I know it\u0027s a girl now, I can tell by the pleading, the agonized scream that follows. Then there\u0027s laughter and congratulations from several voices. Someone cries out, \"Twelve down and eleven to go!\" which gets a round of appreciative hoots.\n So they\u0027re fighting in a pack. I\u0027m not really surprised. Often alliances are formed in the early stages of the Games. The strong band together to hunt down the weak then, when the tension becomes too great, begin to turn on one another. I don\u0027t have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance. It\u0027ll be the remaining Career Tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4. Two boys and three girls. The ones who lunched together.\n For a moment, I hear them checking the girl for supplies. I can tell by their comments they\u0027ve found nothing good. I wonder if the victim is Rue but quickly dismiss the thought. She\u0027s much too bright to be building a fire like that.\n \"Better clear out so they can get the body before it starts stinking.\" I\u0027m almost certain that\u0027s the brutish boy from District 2. There are murmurs of assent and then, to my horror, I hear the pack heading toward me. They do not know I\u0027m here. How could they? And I\u0027m well concealed in the clump of trees. At least while the sun stays down. Then my black sleeping bag will turn from camouflage to trouble. If they just keep moving, they will pass me and be gone in a minute.\n But the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from my tree. They have flashlights, torches. I can see an arm here, a boot there, through the breaks in the branches. I turn to stone, not even daring to breathe. Have they spotted me? No, not yet. I can tell from their words their minds are elsewhere.\n \"Shouldn\u0027t we have heard a cannon by now?\"\n \"I\u0027d say yes. Nothing to prevent them from going in immediately.\"\n \"Unless she isn\u0027t dead.\"\n \"She\u0027s dead. I stuck her myself.\"\n \"Then where\u0027s the cannon?\"\n \"Someone should go back. Make sure the job\u0027s done.\"\n \"Yeah, we don\u0027t want to have to track her down twice.\"\n \"I said she\u0027s dead!\"\n An argument breaks out until one tribute silences the others. \"We\u0027re wasting time! I\u0027ll go finish her and let\u0027s move on!\"\n I almost fall out of the tree. The voice belongs to Peeta. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunger-games-the-hunger-games-1/page-11.html","bookId":1685,"book":{"id":1685,"title":"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1) \n Winning will make you famous. \n Losing means certain death. \n The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts.
