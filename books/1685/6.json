{"id":63833,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"6 The Training Center has a tower designed exclusively for the tributes and their teams. This will be our home until the actual Games begin. Each district has an entire floor. You simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your district. Easy enough to remember. I\u0027ve ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice Building back in District 12. Once to receive the medal for my father\u0027s death and then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to my friends and family. But that\u0027s a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk. The walls of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air. It\u0027s exhilarating and I\u0027m tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can ride it again, but somehow that seems childish. Apparently, Effie Trinket\u0027s duties did not conclude at the station. She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena. In a way, that\u0027s a plus because at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we haven\u0027t seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train. Probably passed out somewhere. Effie Trinket, on the other hand, seems to be flying high. We\u0027re the first team she\u0027s ever chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies. She\u0027s complimentary about not just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves. And, to hear her tell it, Effie knows everyone who\u0027s anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all day, trying to win us sponsors. \"I\u0027ve been very mysterious, though,\" she says, her eyes squint half shut. \"Because, of course, Haymitch hasn\u0027t bothered to tell me your strategies. But I\u0027ve done my best with what I had to work with. How Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister. How you\u0027ve both successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your district.\" Barbarism? That\u0027s ironic coming from a woman helping to prepare us for slaughter. And what\u0027s she basing our success on? Our table manners? \"Everyone has their reservations, naturally. You being from the coal district. But I said, and this was very clever of me, I said, \u0027Well, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls!\u0027\" Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though it\u0027s wrong. Coal doesn\u0027t turn to pearls. They grow in shellfish. Possibly she meant coal turns to diamonds, but that\u0027s untrue, too. I\u0027ve heard they have some sort of machine in District 1 that can turn graphite into diamonds. But we don\u0027t mine graphite in District 12. That was part of District 13\u0027s job until they were destroyed. I wonder if the people she\u0027s been plugging us to all day either know or care. \"Unfortunately, I can\u0027t seal the sponsor deals for you. Only Haymitch can do that,\" says Effie grimly. \"But don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary.\" Although lacking in many departments, Effie Trinket has a certain determination I have to admire. My quarters are larger than our entire house back home. They are plush, like the train car, but also have so many automatic gadgets that I\u0027m sure I won\u0027t have time to press all the buttons. The shower alone has a panel with more than a hundred options you can choose regulating water temperature, pressure, soaps, shampoos, scents, oils, and massaging sponges. When you step out on a mat, heaters come on that blow-dry your body. Instead of struggling with the knots in my wet hair, I merely place my hand on a box that sends a current through my scalp, untangling, parting, and drying my hair almost instantly. It floats down around my shoulders in a glossy curtain. I program the closet for an outfit to my taste. The windows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command. You need only whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears, hot and steamy, before you in less than a minute. I walk around the room eating goose liver and puffy bread until there\u0027s a knock on the door. Effie\u0027s calling me to dinner. Good. I\u0027m starving. Peeta, Cinna, and Portia are standing out on a balcony that overlooks the Capitol when we enter the dining room. I\u0027m glad to see the stylists, particularly after I hear that Haymitch will be joining us. A meal presided over by just Effie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster. Besides, dinner isn\u0027t really about food, it\u0027s about planning out our strategies, and Cinna and Portia have already proven how valuable they are. A silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all stemmed glasses of wine. I think about turning it down, but I\u0027ve never had wine, except the homemade stuff my mother uses for coughs, and when will I get a chance to try it again? I take a sip of the tart, dry liquid and secretly think it could be improved by a few spoonfuls of honey. Haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served. It looks as if he\u0027s had his own stylist because he\u0027s clean and groomed and about as sober as I\u0027ve ever seen him. He doesn\u0027t refuse the offer of wine, but when he starts in on his soup, I realize it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever seen him eat. Maybe he really will pull himself together long enough to help us. Cinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Haymitch and Effie. At least they\u0027re addressing each other decently. And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists\u0027 opening act. While they make small talk, I concentrate on the meal. Mushroom soup, bitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas, rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper, noodles in a green sauce, cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet blue grapes. The servers, all young people dressed in white tunics like the one who gave us wine, move wordlessly to and from the table, keeping the platters and glasses full. About halfway through my glass of wine, my head starts feeling foggy, so I change to water instead. I don\u0027t like the feeling and hope it wears off soon. How Haymitch can stand walking around like this full-time is a mystery. I try to focus on the talk, which has turned to our interview costumes, when a girl sets a gorgeous-looking cake on the table and deftly lights it. It blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out. I have a moment of doubt. \"What makes it burn? Is it alcohol?\" I say, looking up at the girl. \"That\u0027s the last thing I wa - oh! I know you!\" I can\u0027t place a name or time to the girl\u0027s face. But I\u0027m certain of it. The dark red hair, the striking features, the porcelain white skin. But even as I utter the words, I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her, and while I can\u0027t pull it up, I know some bad memory is associated with her. The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease. She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table. When I look back, the four adults are watching me like hawks. \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous, Katniss. How could you possibly know an Avox?\" snaps Effie. \"The very thought.\" \"What\u0027s an Avox?\" I ask stupidly. \"Someone who committed a crime. They cut her tongue so she can\u0027t speak,\" says Haymitch. \"She\u0027s probably a traitor of some sort. Not likely you\u0027d know her.\" \"And even if you did, you\u0027re not to speak to one of them unless it\u0027s to give an order,\" says Effie. \"Of course, you don\u0027t really know her.\" But I do know her. And now that Haymitch has mentioned the word traitor I remember from where. The disapproval is so high I could never admit it. \"No, I guess not, I just - \" I stammer, and the wine is not helping. Peeta snaps his fingers. \"Delly Cartwright. That\u0027s who it is. I kept thinking she looked familiar as well. Then I realized she\u0027s a dead ringer for Delly.\" Delly Cartwright is a pasty-faced, lumpy girl with yellowish hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does a butterfly. She may also be the friendliest person on the planet - she smiles constantly at everybody in school, even me. I have never seen the girl with the red hair smile. But I jump on Peeta\u0027s suggestion gratefully. \"Of course, that\u0027s who I was thinking of. It must be the hair,\" I say. \"Something about the eyes, too,\" says Peeta. The energy at the table relaxes. \"Oh, well. If that\u0027s all it is,\" says Cinna. \"And yes, the cake has spirits, but all the alcohol has burned off. I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut.\" We eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the replay of the opening ceremonies that\u0027s being broadcast. A few of the other couples make a nice impression, but none of them can hold a candle to us. Even our own party lets out an \"Ahh!\" as they show us coming out of the Remake Center. \"Whose idea was the hand holding?\" asks Haymitch. \"Cinna\u0027s,\" says Portia. \"Just the perfect touch of rebellion,\" says Haymitch. \"Very nice.\" Rebellion? I have to think about that one a moment. But when I remember the other couples, standing stiffly apart, never touching or acknowledging each other, as if their fellow tribute did not exist, as if the Games had already begun, I know what Haymitch means. Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes. \"Tomorrow morning is the first training session. Meet me for breakfast and I\u0027ll tell you exactly how I want you to play it,\" says Haymitch to Peeta and I. \"Now go get some sleep while the grown-ups talk.\" Peeta and I walk together down the corridor to our rooms. When we get to my door, he leans against the frame, not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to him. \"So, Delly Cartwright. Imagine finding her lookalike here.\" He\u0027s asking for an explanation, and I\u0027m tempted to give him one. We both know he covered for me. So here I am in his debt again. If I tell him the truth about the girl, somehow that might even things up. How can it hurt really? Even if he repeated the story, it couldn\u0027t do me much harm. It was just something I witnessed. And he lied as much as I did about Delly Cartwright. I realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. Someone who might be able to help me figure out her story. Gale would be my first choice, but it\u0027s unlikely I\u0027ll ever see Gale again. I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any possible advantage over me, but I don\u0027t see how. Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a friend. Besides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me. She has reminded me why I\u0027m here. Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer. To tell or not to tell? My brain still feels slow from the wine. I stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there. Peeta picks up on my hesitation. \"Have you been on the roof yet?\" I shake my head. \"Cinna showed me. You can practically see the whole city. The wind\u0027s a bit loud, though.\" I translate this into \"No one will overhear us talking\" in my head. You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here. \"Can we just go up?\" \"Sure, come on,\" says Peeta. I follow him to a flight of stairs that lead to the roof. There\u0027s a small dome-shaped room with a door to the outside. As we step into the cool, windy evening air, I catch my breath at the view. The Capitol twinkles like a vast field of fireflies. Electricity in District 12 comes and goes, usually we only have it a few hours a day. Often the evenings are spent in candlelight. The only time you can count on it is when they\u0027re airing the Games or some important government message on television that it\u0027s mandatory to watch. But here there would be no shortage. Ever. Peeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. I look straight down the side of the building to the street, which is buzzing with people. You can hear their cars, an occasional shout, and a strange metallic tinkling. In District 12, we\u0027d all be thinking about bed right now. \"I asked Cinna why they let us up here. Weren\u0027t they worried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over the side?\" says Peeta. \"What\u0027d he say?\" I ask. \"You can\u0027t,\" says Peeta. He holds out his hand into seemingly empty space. There\u0027s a sharp zap and he jerks it back. \"Some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof.\" \"Always worried about our safety,\" I say. Even though Cinna has shown Peeta the roof, I wonder if we\u0027re supposed to be up here now, so late and alone. I\u0027ve never seen tributes on the Training Center roof before. But that doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re not being taped. \"Do you think they\u0027re watching us now?\" \"Maybe,\" he admits. \"Come see the garden.\" On the other side of the dome, they\u0027ve built a garden with flower beds and potted trees. From the branches hang hundreds of wind chimes, which account for the tinkling I heard. Here in the garden, on this windy night, it\u0027s enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard. Peeta looks at me expectantly. I pretend to examine a blossom. \"We were hunting in the woods one day. Hidden, waiting for game,\" I whisper. \"You and your father?\" he whispers back. \"No, my friend Gale. Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once. Except one. As if it were giving a warning call. And then we saw her. I\u0027m sure it was the same girl. A boy was with her. Their clothes were tattered. They had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep. They were running as if their lives depended on it,\" I say. For a moment I\u0027m silent, as I remember how the sight of this strange pair, clearly not from District 12, fleeing through the woods immobilized us. Later, we wondered if we could have helped them escape. Perhaps we might have. Concealed them. If we\u0027d moved quickly. Gale and I were taken by surprise, yes, but we\u0027re both hunters. We know how animals look at bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them. But we only watched. \"The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere,\" I continue to Peeta. \"I mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there. It didn\u0027t make a sound, but they saw it. A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like the elevator. They shot some sort of spear through the boy. It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well. But I\u0027m certain he was dead. We heard the girl scream once. The boy\u0027s name, I think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. Vanished into thin air. And the birds began to sing again, as if nothing had happened.\" \"Did they see you?\" Peeta asked. \"I don\u0027t know. We were under a shelf of rock,\" I reply. But I do know. There was a moment, after the birdcall, but before the hovercraft, where the girl had seen us. She\u0027d locked eyes with me and called out for help. But neither Gale or I had responded. \"You\u0027re shivering,\" says Peeta. The wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my body. The girl\u0027s scream. Had it been her last? Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders. I start to take a step back, but then I let him, deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness. A friend would do that, right? \"They were from here?\" he asks, and he secures a button at my neck. I nod. They\u0027d had that Capitol look about them. The boy and the girl. \"Where do you suppose they were going?\" he asks. \"I don\u0027t know that,\" I say. District 12 is pretty much the end of the line. Beyond us, there\u0027s only wilderness. If you don\u0027t count the ruins of District 13 that still smolder from the toxic bombs. They show it on television occasionally, just to remind us. \"Or why they would leave here.\" Haymitch had called the Avoxes traitors. Against what? It could only be the Capitol. But they had everything here. No cause to rebel. \"I\u0027d leave here,\" Peeta blurts out. Then he looks around nervously. It was loud enough to hear above the chimes. He laughs. \"I\u0027d go home now if they let me. But you have to admit, the food\u0027s prime.\" He\u0027s covered again. If that\u0027s all you\u0027d heard it would just sound like the words of a scared tribute, not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol. \"It\u0027s getting chilly. We better go in,\" he says. Inside the dome, it\u0027s warm and bright. His tone is conversational. \"Your friend Gale. He\u0027s the one who took your sister away at the reaping?\" \"Yes. Do you know him?\" I ask. \"Not really. I hear the girls talk about him a lot. I thought he was your cousin or something. You favor each other,\" he says. \"No, we\u0027re not related,\" I say. Peeta nods, unreadable. \"Did he come to say good-bye to you?\" \"Yes,\" I say, observing him carefully. \"So did your father. He brought me cookies.\" Peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. But after watching him lie so smoothly, I don\u0027t give this much weight. \"Really? Well, he likes you and your sister. I think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys.\" The idea that I might ever have been discussed, around the dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in passing in Peeta\u0027s house gives me a start. It must have been when the mother was out of the room. \"He knew your mother when they were kids,\" says Peeta. Another surprise. But probably true. \"Oh, yes. She grew up in town,\" I say. It seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread. We\u0027re at my door. I give back his jacket. \"See you in the morning then.\" \"See you,\" he says, and walks off down the hall. When I open my door, the redheaded girl is collecting my unitard and boots from where I left them on the floor before my shower. I want to apologize for possibly getting her in trouble earlier. But I remember I\u0027m not supposed to speak to her unless I\u0027m giving her an order. \"Oh, sorry,\" I say. \"I was supposed to get those back to Cinna. I\u0027m sorry. Can you take them to him?\" She avoids my eyes, gives a small nod, and heads out the door. I\u0027d set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner. But I know that my apology runs much deeper. That I\u0027m ashamed I never tried to help her in the woods. That I let the Capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without lifting a finger. Just like I was watching the Games. I kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes. The shivering hasn\u0027t stopped. Perhaps the girl doesn\u0027t even remember me. But I know she does. You don\u0027t forget the face of the person who was your last hope. I pull the covers up over my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl who can\u0027t speak. But I can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing through walls and doors and bedding. I wonder if she\u0027ll enjoy watching me die.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunger-games-the-hunger-games-1/page-6.html","bookId":1685,"book":{"id":1685,"title":"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1)","description":"Storyline: The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1) Winning will make you famous.
