But Peeta\u0027s voice stops me. \"We better take it slow on that stew. Remember the first night on the train? The rich food made me sick and I wasn\u0027t even starving then.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right. And I could just inhale the whole thing!\" I say regretfully. But I don\u0027t. We are quite sensible. We each have a roll, half an apple, and an egg-size serving of stew and rice. I make myself eat the stew in tiny spoonfuls - they even sent us silverware and plates - savoring each bite. When we finish, I stare longingly at the dish. \"I want more.\"\\n\\n \"Me, too. Tell you what. We wait an hour, if it stays down, then we get another serving,\" Peeta says.\\n\\n \"Agreed,\" I say. \"It\u0027s going to be a long hour.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe not that long,\" says Peeta. \"What was that you were saying just before the food arrived? Something about me. no competition. best thing that ever happened to you. \"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember that last part,\" I say, hoping it\u0027s too dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush.\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s right. That\u0027s what I was thinking,\" he says. \"Scoot over, I\u0027m freezing.\"\\n\\n I make room for him in the sleeping bag. We lean back against the cave wall, my head on his shoulder, his arms wrapped around me. I can feel Haymitch nudging me to keep up the act. \"So, since we were five, you never even noticed any other girls?\" I ask him.\\n\\n \"No, I noticed just about every girl, but none of them made a lasting impression but you,\" he says.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure that would thrill your parents, you liking a girl from the Seam,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Hardly. But I couldn\u0027t care less. Anyway, if we make it back, you won\u0027t be a girl from the Seam, you\u0027ll be a girl from the Victor\u0027s Village,\" he says.\\n\\n That\u0027s right. If we win, we\u0027ll each get a house in the part of town reserved for Hunger Games\u0027 victors. Long ago, when the Games began, the Capitol had built a dozen fine houses in each district. Of course, in ours only one is occupied. Most of the others have never been lived in at all.\\n\\n A disturbing thought hits me. \"But then, our only neighbor will be Haymitch!\"\\n\\n \"Ah, that\u0027ll be nice,\" says Peeta, tightening his arms around me. \"You and me and Haymitch. Very cozy. Picnics, birthdays, long winter nights around the fire retelling old Hunger Games\u0027 tales.\"\\n\\n \"I told you, he hates me!\" I say, but I can\u0027t help laughing at the image of Haymitch becoming my new pal.\\n\\n \"Only sometimes. When he\u0027s sober, I\u0027ve never heard him say one negative thing about you,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s never sober!\" I protest.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. Who am I thinking of? Oh, I know. It\u0027s Cinna who likes you. But that\u0027s mainly because you didn\u0027t try to run when he set you on fire,\" says Peeta. \"On the other hand, Haymitch. well, if I were you, I\u0027d avoid Haymitch completely. He hates you.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you said I was his favorite,\" I say.\\n\\n \"He hates me more,\" says Peeta. \"I don\u0027t think people in general are his sort of thing.\"\\n\\n I know the audience will enjoy our having fun at Haymitch\u0027s expense. He has been around so long, he\u0027s practically an old friend to some of them. And after his head-dive off the stage at the reaping, everybody knows him. By this time, they\u0027ll have dragged him out of the control room for interviews about us. No telling what sort of lies he\u0027s made up. He\u0027s at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a partner, another victor to help them whereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment. Kind of like me when I was alone in the arena. I wonder how he\u0027s holding up, with the drinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to keep us alive.\\n\\n It\u0027s funny. Haymitch and I don\u0027t get along well in person, but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike because he seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts. Like how I knew I must be close to water when he withheld it and how I knew the sleep syrup just wasn\u0027t something to ease Peeta\u0027s pain and how I know now that I have to play up the romance. He hasn\u0027t made much effort to connect with Peeta really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl of broth to Peeta, whereas I\u0027ll see the strings attached to it.\\n\\n A thought hits me, and I\u0027m amazed the question\u0027s taken so long to surface. Maybe it\u0027s because I\u0027ve only recently begun to view Haymitch with a degree of curiosity. \"How do you think he did it?\"\\n\\n \"Who? Did what?\" Peeta asks.\\n\\n \"Haymitch. How do you think he won the Games?\" I say.\\n\\n Peeta considers this quite a while before he answers. Haymitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or Thresh. He\u0027s not particularly handsome. Not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on you. And he\u0027s so surly, it\u0027s hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. There\u0027s only one way Haymitch could have won, and Peeta says it just as I\u0027m reaching this conclusion myself.\\n\\n \"He outsmarted the others,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n I nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly I\u0027m wondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help Peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive. Maybe he wasn\u0027t always a drunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he tried to help the tributes. But then it got unbearable. It must be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after year after year. I realize that if I get out of here, that will become my job. To mentor the girl from District 12. The idea is so repellent, I thrust it from my mind.\\n\\n About half an hour has passed before I decide I have to eat again. Peeta\u0027s too hungry himself to put up an argument. While I\u0027m dishing up two more small servings of lamb stew and rice, we hear the anthem begin to play. Peeta presses his eyes against a crack in the rocks to watch the sky.\\n\\n \"There won\u0027t be anything to see tonight,\" I say, far more interested in the stew than the sky. \"Nothing\u0027s happened or we would\u0027ve heard a cannon.\"\\n\\n \"Katniss,\" Peeta says quietly.\\n\\n \"What? Should we split another roll, too?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Katniss,\" he repeats, but I find myself wanting to ignore him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to split one. But I\u0027ll save the cheese for tomorrow,\" I say. I see Peeta staring at me. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Thresh is dead,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n \"He can\u0027t be,\" I say.\\n\\n \"They must have fired the cannon during the thunder and we missed it,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n \"Are you sure? I mean, it\u0027s pouring buckets out there. I don\u0027t know how you can see anything,\" I say. I push him away from the rocks and squint out into the dark, rainy sky. For about ten seconds, I catch a distorted glimpse of Thresh\u0027s picture and then he\u0027s gone. Just like that.\\n\\n I slump down against the rocks, momentarily forgetting about the task at hand. Thresh dead. I should be happy, right? One less tribute to face. And a powerful one, too. But I\u0027m not happy. All I can think about is Thresh letting me go, letting me run because of Rue, who died with that spear in her stomach.\\n\\n \"You all right?\" asks Peeta.\\n\\n I give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my hands, hugging them close to my body. I have to bury the real pain because who\u0027s going to bet on a tribute who keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents. Rue was one thing. We were allies. She was so young. But no one will understand my sorrow at Thresh\u0027s murder. The word pulls me up short. Murder! Thankfully, I didn\u0027t say it aloud. That\u0027s not going to win me any points in the arena. What I do say is, \"It\u0027s just. if we didn\u0027t win. I wanted Thresh to. Because he let me go. And because of Rue.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know,\" says Peeta. \"But this means we\u0027re one step closer to District Twelve.\" He nudges a plate of foot into my hands. \"Eat. It\u0027s still warm.\"\\n\\n I take a bite of the stew to show I don\u0027t really care, but it\u0027s like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow. \"It also means Cato will be back hunting us.\"\\n\\n \"And he\u0027s got supplies again,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be wounded, I bet,\" I say.\\n\\n \"What makes you say that?\" Peeta asks.\\n\\n \"Because Thresh would have never gone down without a fight. He\u0027s so strong, I mean, he was. And they were in his territory,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Good,\" says Peeta. \"The more wounded Cato is the better. I wonder how Foxface is making out.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, she\u0027s fine,\" I say peevishly. I\u0027m still angry she thought of hiding in the Cornucopia and I didn\u0027t. \"Probably be easier to catch Cato than her.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe they\u0027ll catch each other and we can just go home,\" says Peeta. \"But we better be extra careful about the watches. I dozed off a few times.\"\\n\\n \"Me, too,\" I admit. \"But not tonight.\"\\n\\n We finish our food in silence and then Peeta offers to take the first watch. I burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him, pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras. I just need a few moments of privacy where I can let any emotion cross my face without being seen. Under the hood, I silently say good-bye to Thresh and thank him for my life. I promise to remember him and, if I can, do something to help his family and Rue\u0027s, if I win. Then I escape into sleep, comforted by a full belly and the steady warmth of Peeta beside me.\\n\\n When Peeta wakes me later, the first thing I register is the smell of goat cheese. He\u0027s holding out half a roll spread with the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices. \"Don\u0027t be mad,\" he says. \"I had to eat again. Here\u0027s your half.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, good,\" I say, immediately taking a huge bite. The strong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind Prim makes, the apples are sweet and crunchy. \"Mm.\"\\n\\n \"We make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery,\" he says.\\n\\n \"Bet that\u0027s expensive,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Too expensive for my family to eat. Unless it\u0027s gone very stale. Of course, practically everything we eat is stale,\" says Peeta, pulling the sleeping bag up around him. In less than a minute, he\u0027s snoring.\\n\\n Huh. I always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life.\\n\\n And it\u0027s true, Peeta has always had enough to eat. But there\u0027s something kind of depressing about living your life on stale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no one else wanted. One thing about us, since I bring our food home on a daily basis, most of it is so fresh you have to make sure it isn\u0027t going to make a run for it.\\n\\n Somewhere during my shift, the rain stops not gradually but all at once. The downpour ends and there\u0027s only the residual drippings of water from branches, the rush of the now overflowing stream below us. A full, beautiful moon emerges, and even without the glasses I can see outside. I can\u0027t decide if the moon is real or merely a projection of the Gamemakers. I know it was full shortly before I left home. Gale and I watched it rise as we hunted into the late hours.\\n\\n How long have I been gone? I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s been about two weeks in the arena, and there was that week of preparation in the Capitol. Maybe the moon has completed its cycle. For some reason, I badly want it to be my moon, the same one I see from the woods around District 12. That would give me something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena where the authenticity of everything is to be doubted.\\n\\n Four of us left.\\n\\n For the first time, I allow myself to truly think about the possibility that I might make it home. To fame. To wealth. To my own house in the Victor\u0027s Village. My mother and Prim would live there with me. No more fear of hunger. A new kind of freedom. But then. what? What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food. Take that away and I\u0027m not really sure who I am, what my identity is. The idea scares me some. I think of Haymitch, with all his money. What did his life become? He lives alone, no wife or children, most of his waking hours drunk. I don\u0027t want to end up like that.\\n\\n \"But you won\u0027t be alone,\" I whisper to myself. I have my mother and Prim. Well, for the time being. And then. I don\u0027t want to think about then, when Prim has grown up, my mother passed away. I know I\u0027ll never marry, never risk bringing a child into the world. Because if there\u0027s one thing being a victor doesn\u0027t guarantee, it\u0027s your children\u0027s safety. My kids\u0027 names would go right into the reaping balls with everyone else\u0027s. And I swear I\u0027ll never let that happen.\\n\\n The sun eventually rises, its light slipping through the cracks and illuminating Peeta\u0027s face. Who will he transform into if we make it home? This perplexing, good-natured boy who can spin out lies so convincingly the whole of Panem believes him to be hopelessly in love with me, and I\u0027ll admit it, there are moments when he makes me believe it myself? At least, we\u0027ll be friends, I think. Nothing will change the fact that we\u0027ve saved each other\u0027s lives in here. And beyond that, he will always be the boy with the bread. Good friends. Anything beyond that though. and I feel Gale\u0027s gray eyes watching me watching Peeta, all the way from District 12.\\n\\n Discomfort causes me to move. I scoot over and shake Peeta\u0027s shoulder. His eyes open sleepily and when they focus on me, he pulls me down for a long kiss.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re wasting hunting time,\" I say when I finally break away.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t call it wasting,\" he says giving a big stretch as he sits up. \"So do we hunt on empty stomachs to give us an edge?\"\\n\\n \"Not us,\" I say. \"We stuff ourselves to give us staying power.\"\\n\\n \"Count me in,\" Peeta says. But I can see he\u0027s surprised when I divide the rest of the stew and rice and hand a heaping plate to him. \"All this?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll earn it back today,\" I say, and we both plow into our plates. Even cold, it\u0027s one of the best things I\u0027ve ever tasted. I abandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my finger. \"I can feel Effie Trinket shuddering at my manners.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Effie, watch this!\" says Peeta. He tosses his fork over his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue making loud, satisfied sounds. Then he blows a kiss out to her in general and calls, \"We miss you, Effie!\"\\n\\n I cover his mouth with my hand, but I\u0027m laughing. \"Stop! Cato could be right outside our cave.\"\\n\\n He grabs my hand away. \"What do I care? I\u0027ve got you to protect me now,\" says Peeta, pulling me to him.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" I say in exasperation, extricating myself from his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss.\\n\\n Once we\u0027re packed up and standing outside our cave, our mood shifts to serious. It\u0027s as though for the last few days, sheltered by the rocks and the rain and Cato\u0027s preoccupation with Thresh, we were given a respite, a holiday of sorts. Now, although the day is sunny and warm, we both sense we\u0027re really back in the Games. I hand Peeta my knife, since whatever weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his belt. My last seven arrows - of the twelve I sacrificed three in the explosion, two at the feast - rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver. I can\u0027t afford to lose any more.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be hunting us by now,\" says Peeta. \"Cato isn\u0027t one to wait for his prey to wander by.\"\\n\\n \"If he\u0027s wounded - \" I begin.\\n\\n \"It won\u0027t matter,\" Peeta breaks in. \"If he can move, he\u0027s coming.\"\\n\\n With all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by several feet on either side. We stop there to replenish our water. I check the snares I set days ago and come up empty. Not surprising with the weather. Besides, I haven\u0027t seen many animals or signs of them in this area.\\n\\n \"If we want food, we better head back up to my old hunting grounds,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Your call. Just tell me what you need me to do,\" Peeta says.\\n\\n \"Keep an eye out,\" I say. \"Stay on the rocks as much as possible, no sense in leaving him tracks to follow. And listen for both of us.\" It\u0027s clear, at this point, that the explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for good.\\n\\n I\u0027d walk in the water to cover our tracks completely, but I\u0027m not sure Peeta\u0027s leg could take the current. Although the drugs have erased the infection, he\u0027s still pretty weak. My forehead hurts along the knife cut, but after three days the bleeding has stopped. I wear a bandage around my head though, just in case physical exertion should bring it back.\\n\\n As we head up alongside the stream, we pass the place where I found Peeta camouflaged in the weeds and mud. One good thing, between the downpour and the flooded banks, all signs of his hiding place have been wiped out. That means that, if need be, we can come back to our cave. Otherwise, I wouldn\u0027t risk it with Cato after us.\\n\\n The boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn to pebbles, and then, to my relief, we\u0027re back on pine needles and the gentle incline of the forest floor. For the first time, I realize we have a problem. Navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg - well, you\u0027re naturally going to make some noise. But even on the smooth bed of needles, Peeta is loud. And I mean loud loud, as if he\u0027s stomping his feet or something. I turn and look at him.\\n\\n \"What?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to move more quietly,\" I say. \"Forget about Cato, you\u0027re chasing off every rabbit in a ten-mile radius.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" he says. \"Sorry, I didn\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n So, we start up again and he\u0027s a tiny bit better, but even with only one working ear, he\u0027s making me jump.\\n\\n \"Can you take your boots off?\" I suggest.\\n\\n \"Here?\" he asks in disbelief, as if I\u0027d asked him to walk barefoot on hot coals or something. I have to remind myself that he\u0027s still not used to the woods, that it\u0027s the scary, forbidden place beyond the fences of District 12. I think of Gale, with his velvet tread. It\u0027s eerie how little sound he makes, even when the leaves have fallen and it\u0027s a challenge to move at all without chasing off the game. I feel certain he\u0027s laughing back home.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I say patiently. \"I will, too. That way we\u0027ll both be quieter.\" Like I was making any noise. So we both strip off our boots and socks and, while there\u0027s some improvement, I could swear he\u0027s making an effort to snap every branch we encounter.\\n\\n Needless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my old camp with Rue, I\u0027ve shot nothing. If the stream would settle down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too strong. As we stop to rest and drink water, I try to work out a solution. Ideally, I\u0027d dump Peeta now with some simple root-gathering chore and go hunt, but then he\u0027d be left with only a knife to defend himself against Cato\u0027s spears and superior strength. So what I\u0027d really like is to try and conceal him somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him. But I have a feeling his ego isn\u0027t going to go for that suggestion.\\n\\n \"Katniss,\" he says. \"We need to split up. I know I\u0027m chasing away the game.\"\\n\\n \"Only because your leg\u0027s hurt,\" I say generously, because really, you can tell that\u0027s only a small part of the problem.\\n\\n \"I know,\" he says. \"So, why don\u0027t you go on? Show me some plants to gather and that way we\u0027ll both be useful.\"\\n\\n \"Not if Cato comes and kills you.\" I tried to say it in a nice way, but it still sounds like I think he\u0027s a weakling.\\n\\n Surprisingly, he just laughs. \"Look, I can handle Cato. I fought him before, didn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n Yeah, and that turned out great. You ended up dying in a mud bank. That\u0027s what I want to say, but I can\u0027t. He did save my life by taking on Cato after all. I try another tactic. \"What if you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while I hunted?\" I say, trying to make it sound like very important work.\\n\\n \"What if you show me what\u0027s edible around here and go get us some meat?\" he says, mimicking my tone. \"Just don\u0027t go far, in case you need help.\"\\n\\n I sigh and show him some roots to dig. We do need food, no question. One apple, two rolls, and a blob of cheese the size of a plum won\u0027t last long. I\u0027ll just go a short distance and hope Cato is a long way off.\\n\\n I teach him a bird whistle - not a melody like Rue\u0027s but a simple two-note whistle - which we can use to communicate that we\u0027re all right. Fortunately, he\u0027s good at this. Leaving him with the pack, I head off.\\n\\n I feel like I\u0027m eleven again, tethered not to the safety of the fence but to Peeta, allowing myself twenty, maybe thirty yards of hunting space. Away from him though, the woods come alive with animal sounds. Reassured by his periodic whistles, I allow myself to drift farther away, and soon have two rabbits and a fat squirrel to show for it. I decide it\u0027s enough. I can set snares and maybe get some fish. With Peeta\u0027s roots, this will be enough for now.\\n\\n As I travel the short distance back, I realize we haven\u0027t exchanged signals in a while. When my whistle receives no response, I run. In no time, I find the pack, a neat pile of roots beside it. The sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers it. But where is he?\\n\\n \"Peeta!\" I call out in a panic. \"Peeta!\" I turn to the rustle of brush and almost send an arrow through him. Fortunately, I pull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to his left. He jumps back, flinging a handful of berries into the foliage.\\n\\n My fear comes out as anger. \"What are you doing? You\u0027re supposed to be here, not running around in the woods!\"\\n\\n \"I found some berries down by the stream,\" he says, clearly confused by my outburst.\\n\\n \"I whistled. Why didn\u0027t you whistle back?\" I snap at him.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t hear. The water\u0027s too loud, I guess,\" he says. He crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders. That\u0027s when I feel that I\u0027m trembling.\\n\\n \"I thought Cato killed you!\" I almost shout.\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m fine.\" Peeta wraps his arms around me, but I don\u0027t respond. \"Katniss?\"\\n\\n I push away, trying to sort out my feelings. \"If two people agree on a signal, they stay in range. Because if one of them doesn\u0027t answer, they\u0027re in trouble, all right?\"\\n\\n \"All right!\" he says.\\n\\n \"All right. Because that\u0027s what happened with Rue, and I watched her die!\" I say. I turn away from him, go to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water, although I still have some in mine. But I\u0027m not ready to forgive him. I notice the food. The rolls and apples are untouched, but someone\u0027s definitely picked away part of the cheese. \"And you ate without me!\" I really don\u0027t care, I just want something else to be mad about.\\n\\n \"What? No, I didn\u0027t,\" Peeta says.\\n\\n \"Oh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese,\" I say.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what ate the cheese,\" Peeta says slowly and distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, \"but it wasn\u0027t me. I\u0027ve been down by the stream collecting berries. Would you care for some?\"\\n\\n I would actually, but I don\u0027t want to relent too soon. I do walk over and look at them. I\u0027ve never seen this type before. No, I have. But not in the arena. These aren\u0027t Rue\u0027s berries, although they resemble them. Nor do they match any I learned about in training. I lean down and scoop up a few, rolling them between my fingers.\\n\\n My father\u0027s voice comes back to me. \"Not these, Katniss. Never these. They\u0027re nightlock. You\u0027ll be dead before they reach your stomach.\"\\n\\n Just then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting Peeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away. What\u0027s left of Foxface\u0027s emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight.\\n\\n I should have known the moment I saw the missing cheese.\\n\\n Peeta has me by the arm, pushing me toward a tree. \"Climb. He\u0027ll be here in a second. We\u0027ll stand a better chance fighting him from above.\"\\n\\n I stop him, suddenly calm. \"No, Peeta, she\u0027s your kill, not Cato\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"What? I haven\u0027t even seen her since the first day,\" he says. \"How could I have killed her?\"\\n\\n In answer, I hold out the berries. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunger-games-the-hunger-games-1/page-23.html","bookId":1685,"book":{"id":1685,"title":"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1)","description":"Storyline: The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1) \\n Winning will make you famous. \\n Losing means certain death. \\n The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games.
