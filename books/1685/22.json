{"id":63849,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"22 The sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gently pulls me toward consciousness. I fight to return to sleep though, wrapped in a warm cocoon of blankets, safe at home. I\u0027m vaguely aware that my head aches. Possibly I have the flu and this is why I\u0027m allowed to stay in bed, even though I can tell I\u0027ve been asleep a long time. My mother\u0027s hand strokes my cheek and I don\u0027t push it away as I would in wakefulness, never wanting her to know how much I crave that gentle touch. How much I miss her even though I still don\u0027t trust her. Then there\u0027s a voice, the wrong voice, not my mother\u0027s, and I\u0027m scared. \"Katniss,\" it says. \"Katniss, can you hear me?\" My eyes open and the sense of security vanishes. I\u0027m not home, not with my mother. I\u0027m in a dim, chilly cave, my bare feet freezing despite the cover, the air tainted with the unmistakable smell of blood. The haggard, pale face of a boy slides into view, and after an initial jolt of alarm, I feel better. \"Peeta.\" \"Hey,\" he says. \"Good to see your eyes again.\" \"How long have I been out?\" I ask. \"Not sure. I woke up yesterday evening and you were lying next to me in a very scary pool of blood,\" he says. \"I think it\u0027s stopped finally, but I wouldn\u0027t sit up or anything.\" I gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged. This simple gesture leaves me weak and dizzy. Peeta holds a bottle to my lips and I drink thirstily. \"You\u0027re better,\" I say. \"Much better. Whatever you shot into my arm did the trick,\" he says. \"By this morning, almost all the swelling in my leg was gone.\" He doesn\u0027t seem angry about my tricking him, drugging him, and running off to the feast. Maybe I\u0027m just too beat-up and I\u0027ll hear about it later when I\u0027m stronger. But for the moment, he\u0027s all gentleness. \"Did you eat?\" I ask. \"I\u0027m sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that groosling before I realized it might have to last a while. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m back on a strict diet,\" he says. \"No, it\u0027s good. You need to eat. I\u0027ll go hunting soon,\" I say. \"Not too soon, all right?\" he says. \"You just let me take care of you for a while.\" I don\u0027t really seem to have much choice. Peeta feeds me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water. He rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around my chin. \"Your boots and socks are still damp and the weather\u0027s not helping much,\" he says. There\u0027s a clap of thunder, and I see lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. Rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging the square of plastic into the rock above me. \"I wonder what brought on this storm? I mean, who\u0027s the target?\" says Peeta. \"Cato and Thresh,\" I say without thinking. \"Foxface will be in her den somewhere, and Clove. she cut me an then. \" My voice trails off. \"I know Clove\u0027s dead. I saw it in the sky last night,\" h says. \"Did you kill her?\" \"No. Thresh broke her skull with a rock,\" I say. \"Lucky he didn\u0027t catch you, too,\" says Peeta. The memory of the feast returns full-force and I feel sick. \"He did. But he let me go.\" Then, of course, I have to tell him. About things I\u0027ve kept to myself because he was too sick to ask and I wasn\u0027t ready to relive anyway. Like the explosion and my ear and Rue\u0027s dying and the boy from District 1 and the bread. All of which leads to what happened with Thresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts. \"He let you go because he didn\u0027t want to owe you anything?\" asks Peeta in disbelief. \"Yes. I don\u0027t expect you to understand it. You\u0027ve always had enough. But if you\u0027d lived in the Seam, I wouldn\u0027t have to explain,\" I say. \"And don\u0027t try. Obviously I\u0027m too dim to get it.\" \"It\u0027s like the bread. How I never seem to get over owing you for that,\" I say. \"The bread? What? From when we were kids?\" he says. \"I think we can let that go. I mean, you just brought me back from the dead.\" \"But you didn\u0027t know me. We had never even spoken. Besides, it\u0027s the first gift that\u0027s always the hardest to pay back. I wouldn\u0027t even have been here to do it if you hadn\u0027t helped me then,\" I say. \"Why did you, anyway?\" \"Why? You know why,\" Peeta says. I give my head a slight, painful shake. \"Haymitch said you would take a lot of convincing.\" \"Haymitch?\" I ask. \"What\u0027s he got to do with it?\" \"Nothing,\" Peeta says. \"So, Cato and Thresh, huh? I guess it\u0027s too much to hope that they\u0027ll simultaneously destroy each other?\" But the thought only upsets me. \"I think we would like Thresh. I think he\u0027d be our friend back in District Twelve,\" I say. \"Then let\u0027s hope Cato kills him, so we don\u0027t have to,\" says Peeta grimly. I don\u0027t want Cato to kill Thresh at all. I don\u0027t want anyone else to die. But this is absolutely not the kind of thing that victors go around saying in the arena. Despite my best efforts, I can feel tears starting to pool in my eyes. Peeta looks at me in concern. \"What is it? Are you in a lot of pain?\" I give him another answer, because it is equally true but can be taken as a brief moment of weakness instead of a terminal one. \"I want to go home, Peeta,\" I say plaintively, like a small child. \"You will. I promise,\" he says, and bends over to give me a kiss. \"I want to go home now,\" I say. \"Tell you what. You go back to sleep and dream of home. And you\u0027ll be there for real before you know it,\" lie says. \"Okay?\" \"Okay,\" I whisper. \"Wake me if you need me to keep watch.\" \"I\u0027m good and rested, thanks to you and Haymitch. Besides, who knows how long this will last?\" he says. What does he mean? The storm? The brief respite ii brings us? The Games themselves? I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027m ion sad and tired to ask. It\u0027s evening when Peeta wakes me again. The rain has turned to a downpour, sending streams of water through our ceiling where earlier there had been only drips. Peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it from me. I feel a bit better, able to sit up without getting too dizzy, and I\u0027m absolutely famished. So is Peeta. It\u0027s clear he\u0027s been waiting for me to wake up to eat and is eager to get started. There\u0027s not much left. Two pieces of groosling, a small mishmash of roots, and a handful of dried fruit. \"Should we try and ration it?\" Peeta asks. \"No, let\u0027s just finish it. The groosling\u0027s getting old anyway, and the last thing we need is to get sick off spoiled food,\" I say, dividing the food into two equal piles. We try and eat slowly, but we\u0027re both so hungry were done in a couple of minutes. My stomach is in no way satisfied. \"Tomorrow\u0027s a hunting day,\" I say. \"I won\u0027t be much help with that,\" Peeta says. \"I\u0027ve never hunted before.\" \"I\u0027ll kill and you cook,\" I say. \"And you can always gather.\" \"I wish there was some sort of bread bush out there,\" says Peeta. \"The bread they sent me from District Eleven was still warm,\" I say with a sigh. \"Here, chew these.\" I hand him a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth. It\u0027s hard to even see the projection in the sky, but it\u0027s clear enough to know there were no more deaths today. So Cato and Thresh haven\u0027t had it out yet. \"Where did Thresh go? I mean, what\u0027s on the far side of the circle?\" I ask Peeta. \"A field. As far as you can see it\u0027s full of grasses as high as my shoulders. I don\u0027t know, maybe some of them are grain. There are patches of different colors. But there are no paths,\" says Peeta. \"I bet some of them are grain. I bet Thresh knows which ones, too,\" I say. \"Did you go in there?\" \"No. Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that grass. It has a sinister feeling to it. Every time I look at that field, all I can think of are hidden things. Snakes, and rabid animals, and quicksand,\" Peeta says. \"There could be anything in there.\" I don\u0027t say so but Peeta\u0027s words remind me of the warnings they give us about not going beyond the fence in District 12. I can\u0027t help, for a moment, comparing him with Gale, who would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a threat. Thresh certainly did. It\u0027s not that Peeta\u0027s soft exactly, and he\u0027s proved he\u0027s not a coward. But there are things you don\u0027t question too much, I guess, when your home always smells like baking bread, whereas Gale questions everything. What would Peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes between us as we break the law each day? Would it shock him? The things we say about Panem? Gale\u0027s tirades against the Capitol? \"Maybe there is a bread bush in that field,\" I say. \"Maybe that\u0027s why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started the Games.\" \"Either that or he\u0027s got very generous sponsors,\" says Peeta. \"I wonder what we\u0027d have to do to get Haymitch to send us some bread.\" I raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesn\u0027t know about the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago. One kiss equals one pot of broth. It\u0027s not the sort of thing I can blurt out, either. To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all. Somehow, believably, I\u0027ve got to get things back on track. Something simple to start with. I reach out and take his hand. \"Well, he probably used up a lot of resources helping me knock you out,\" I say mischievously. \"Yeah, about that,\" says Peeta, entwining his fingers in mine. \"Don\u0027t try something like that again.\" \"Or what?\" I ask. \"Or. or. \" He can\u0027t think of anything good. \"Just give me a minute.\" \"What\u0027s the problem?\" I say with a grin. \"The problem is we\u0027re both still alive. Which only reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing,\" says Peeta. \"I did do the right thing,\" I say. \"No! Just don\u0027t, Katniss!\" His grip tightens, hurting my hand, and there\u0027s real anger in his voice. \"Don\u0027t die for me. You won\u0027t be doing me any favors. All right?\" I\u0027m startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent opportunity for getting food, so I try to keep up. \"Maybe I did it for myself, Peeta, did you ever think of that? Maybe you aren\u0027t the only one who. who worries about. what it would be like if. \" I fumble. I\u0027m not as smooth with words as Peeta. And while I was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again and I realized how much I don\u0027t want him to die. And it\u0027s not about the sponsors. And it\u0027s not about what will happen back home. And it\u0027s not just that I don\u0027t want to be alone. It\u0027s him. I do not want to lose the boy with the bread. \"If what, Katniss?\" he says softly. I wish I could pull the shutters closed, blocking out this moment from the prying eyes of Panem. Even if it means losing food. Whatever I\u0027m feeling, it\u0027s no one\u0027s business but mine. \"That\u0027s exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer clear of,\" I say evasively, although Haymitch never said anything of the kind. In fact, he\u0027s probably cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged moment. But Peeta somehow catches it. \"Then I\u0027ll just have to fill in the blanks myself,\" he says, and moves in to me. This is the first kiss that we\u0027re both fully aware of. Neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious. Our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold. This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest. Warm and curious. This is the first kiss that makes me want another. But I don\u0027t get it. Well, I do get a second kiss, but it\u0027s just a light one on the tip of my nose because Peeta\u0027s been distracted. \"I think your wound is bleeding again. Come on, lie down, it\u0027s bedtime anyway,\" he says. My socks are dry enough to wear now. I make Peeta put his jacket back on. The damp cold seems to cut right down to my bones, so he must be half frozen. I insist on taking the first watch, too, although neither of us think it\u0027s likely anyone will come in this weather. But he won\u0027t agree unless I\u0027m in the bag, too, and I\u0027m shivering so hard that it\u0027s pointless to object. In stark contrast to two nights ago, when I felt Peeta was a million miles away, I\u0027m struck by his immediacy now. As we settle in, he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow, the other rests protectively over me even when he goes to sleep. No one has held me like this in such a long time. Since my father died and I stopped trusting my mother, no one else\u0027s arms have made me feel this safe. With the aid of the glasses, I lie watching the drips of water splatter on the cave floor. Rhythmic and lulling. Several times, I drift off briefly and then snap awake, guilty and angry with myself. After three or four hours, I can\u0027t help it, I have to rouse Peeta because I can\u0027t keep my eyes open. He doesn\u0027t seem to mind. \"Tomorrow, when it\u0027s dry, I\u0027ll find us a place so high in the trees we can both sleep in peace,\" I promise as I drift off. But tomorrow is no better in terms of weather. The deluge continues as if the Gamemakers are intent on washing us all away. The thunder\u0027s so powerful it seems to shake the ground. Peeta\u0027s considering heading out anyway to scavenge for food, but I tell him in this storm it would be pointless. He won\u0027t be able to see three feet in front of his face and he\u0027ll only end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles. He knows I\u0027m right, but the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful. The day drags on turning into evening and there\u0027s no break in the weather. Haymitch is our only hope, but nothing is forthcoming, either from lack of money - everything will cost an exorbitant amount - or because he\u0027s dissatisfied with our performance. Probably the latter. I\u0027d be the first to admit we\u0027re not exactly riveting today. Starving, weak from injuries, trying not to reopen wounds. We\u0027re sitting huddled together wrapped in the sleeping bag, yes, but mostly to keep warm. The most exciting thing either of us does is nap. I\u0027m not really sure how to ramp up the romance. The kiss last night was nice, but working up to another will take some forethought. There are girls in the Seam, some of the merchant girls, too, who navigate these waters so easily. But I\u0027ve never had much time or use for it. Anyway, just a kiss isn\u0027t enough anymore clearly because if it was we\u0027d have gotten food last night. My instincts tell me Haymitch isn\u0027t just looking for physical affection, he wants something more personal. The sort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when we were practicing for the interview. I\u0027m rotten at it, but Peeta\u0027s not. Maybe the best approach is to get him talking. \"Peeta,\" I say lightly. \"You said at the interview you\u0027d had a crush on me forever. When did forever start?\" \"Oh, let\u0027s see. I guess the first day of school. We were five. You had on a red plaid dress and your hair. it was in two braids instead of one. My father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up,\" Peeta says. \"Your father? Why?\" I ask. \"He said, \u0027See that little girl? I wanted to marry her mother, but she ran off with a coal miner,\u0027\" Peeta says. \"What? You\u0027re making that up!\" I exclaim. \"No, true story,\" Peeta says. \"And I said, \u0027A coal miner? Why did she want a coal miner if she could\u0027ve had you?\u0027 And he said, \u0027Because when he sings. even the birds stop to listen.\u0027\" \"That\u0027s true. They do. I mean, they did,\" I say. I\u0027m stunned and surprisingly moved, thinking of the baker telling this to Peeta. It strikes me that my own reluctance to sing, my own dismissal of music might not really be that I think it\u0027s a waste of time. It might be because it reminds me too much of my father. \"So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who knew the valley song. Your hand shot right up in the air. She stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us. And I swear, every bird outside the windows fell silent,\" Peeta says. \"Oh, please,\" I say, laughing. \"No, it happened. And right when your song ended, I knew - just like your mother - I was a goner,\" Peeta says. \"Then for the next eleven years, I tried to work up the nerve to talk to you.\" \"Without success,\" I add. \"Without success. So, in a way, my name being drawn in the reaping was a real piece of luck,\" says Peeta. For a moment, I\u0027m almost foolishly happy and then confusion sweeps over me. Because we\u0027re supposed to be making up this stuff, playing at being in love not actually being in love. But Peeta\u0027s story has a ring of truth to it. That part about my father and the birds. And I did sing the first day of school, although I don\u0027t remember the song. And that red plaid dress. there was one, a hand-me-down to Prim that got washed to rags after my father\u0027s death. It would explain another thing, too. Why Peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. So, if those details are true. could it all be true? \"You have a. remarkable memory,\" I say haltingly. \"I remember everything about you,\" says Peeta, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. \"You\u0027re the one who wasn\u0027t paying attention.\" \"I am now,\" I say. \"Well, I don\u0027t have much competition here,\" he says. I want to draw away, to close those shutters again, but I know I can\u0027t. It\u0027s as if I can hear Haymitch whispering in my ear, \"Say it! Say it!\" I swallow hard and get the words out. \"You don\u0027t have much competition anywhere.\" And this time, it\u0027s me who leans in. Our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside makes us jump. My bow comes up, the arrow ready to fly, but there\u0027s no other sound. Peeta peers through the rocks and then gives a whoop. Before I can stop him, lie\u0027s out in the rain, then handing something in to me. A silver parachute attached to a basket. I rip it open at once and inside there\u0027s a feast - fresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a tureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice. The very dish I told Caesar Flickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to offer. Peeta wriggles back inside, his face lit up like the sun. \"I guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve.\" \"I guess so,\" I answer. But in my head I can hear Haymitch\u0027s smug, if slightly exasperated, words, \"Yes, that\u0027s what I\u0027m looking lot, sweetheart.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunger-games-the-hunger-games-1/page-22.html","bookId":1685,"book":{"id":1685,"title":"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1)","description":"Storyline: The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games #1) Winning will make you famous.
