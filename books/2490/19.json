{"id":105050,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"She dreamt of the old seraglio again, of wandering through its cramped, lightless cells with a ledger in one hand and a lantern in the other. One of the rooms had been filled with ice, and holding the lantern aloft, she had seen Jamie, frozen in a block of it, like a fly trapped in amber. It should have been comical, absurd, but it wasn\u0027t. His eyes were open, sunken like the eyes of the corpses the workhouse sent, and she saw blood on his neck, staining the open collar of his shirt. The ice flashed like blue diamonds when she raised her lantern, making his eyes seem to move, but she knew he was dead. Her heart twisted, slammed within her, hurting, hurting, knowing he was dead and that she\u0027d have to go home alone. It was her fault. She hadn\u0027t come swiftly enough, been clever enough, been brave enough... She had failed to be adequate, as she had failed all her life. She propped the ledger against the block, trying desperately to find his name in it, but the cold in the room made her hands shake so badly she couldn\u0027t read. He can\u0027t be dead, she thought frantically, he can\u0027t be. He\u0027s frozen in the ice, but the ice will keep him alive... She woke gasping, her hands and feet bitter cold, and heard, from the other room, Margaret saying, \"You hadn\u0027t found anything there, but she insisted on going anyway! As if she knew more about it than you did! Just because she\u0027s got that horrid medical degree, and cuts up bodies, which makes me shudder just to think about, she thinks she knows everything! And she wouldn\u0027t even stop when I turned my foot...\" Under the indignation of Margaret\u0027s voice there was a brittleness that Lydia recognized as nervousness. Ysidro, she thought. A moment later the vampire\u0027s cool voice responded, \"Well, she is worried about her husband, and perhaps that made her careless of your comforts, Margharita? You do not recall which cemetery this was? I would not wish to waken her.\" \"Um... I can\u0027t remember... We went in Prince Razumovsky\u0027s carriage, after we visited this filthy mosque and she talked to a horrid old man. And anyway, if you didn\u0027t see anything there when you went...\" Lydia fumbled her spectacles from the bed beside her, pushed back her hair and pulled her shawl about her shoulders as she emerged from the bedroom, rumpled, creased, and slightly disoriented, wondering what time it was. Ysidro was on his feet at once, bowing. \"Mistress.\" The room smelled of lamb and onions. There was an empty plate of very fine red-glazed local ware, and horn- and-steel flatware. Crumbs and droplets at the other side of the table indicated that Margaret had made her meal. Lydia shook her head, saying, \"Later, thank you,\" when Ysidro moved toward the sideboard. \"Some wine, at least?\" But his own hand was too unsteady to hold the glass. Margaret took it swiftly from him, poured the black-red fluid like blood in the brazen lamplight. Ysidro flicked aside the napkin from the basket on the table, tore a chunk from the bread inside. \"Sop it in the wine,\" he suggested, holding it out to her. \"A jauntering slut I can abide, but a drunken jauntering slut, never.\" And Lydia gave him a quick, shaky grin. He perched on a corner of the table. \"Margharita informs me you passed an adventuresome day.\" Lydia outlined to him the events of the Blue Mosque and the finding of the turbe and the cravat pin. \"I had the most extraordinary sensation that he was there, listening,\" she said. \"I know you\u0027ve said vampires sleep in the daytime and can\u0027t be wakened, but... Would he have heard me-seen me-in dreams? Do vampires dream?\" \"Yes and no,\" replied Ysidro, holding out his hand for the pin. \"Sleep is only a term that we use for what happens to us when the sun is in the sky; I do not know another. Dreaming...\" He paused, then shook his head, very slightly, and turned the tiny gold griffin over in his hands. \"I doubt not that you have found one of the sleeping places of the intruder, the newcomer,\" he said after a time. \"And havine sensed you in his sleep, I misdoubt he will ever rest in that tomb again. Still, it is worth the visiting, to see perhaps what I have missed. There is a great strength to him, and it is not at all unlikely that he could turn my mind, my perceptions, away from him... And it goes without saying that any place he dominates with his presence at night, Anthea will avoid. It is no chance thing that he haunts the cemeteries, that any coming or going from the city would pass him and be in danger of coming under his sway. Anthea, at least, coming in by train with your husband, would have sensed his presence and taken care to avoid him. Charles...\" He shook his head. \"He plays a dangerous game, this Karolyi.\" He slipped the griffin pin into the pocket of his waistcoat and stood to fetch a pot of honey from the sideboard and set it for her next to the bread. \"He still does not understand what it is that he courts. Does he think to take this interloper back to Vienna and introduce him to that stodgy mediocrity in the Hofburg? The Master of Vienna will surely destroy him, as he attempted to destroy Ernchester. Or does he think to make him Master of Constantinople, forge an alliance here?\" \"Could he do that?\" she asked, surprised. \"He may, could he find the master\u0027s hiding place.\" The sparse brows pinched together, and his eyes went to the pile of notes and pencils on the other side of the table lamps. \"And what did your search reveal?\" \"That a lot of wealthy old Turks who\u0027d had their money in gold and land all had the same idea around July of this year.\" She sighed ruefully and pushed her glasses up onto her nose. \"I\u0027ve got a tremendous list of companies that all came into being at the same time and don\u0027t seem to have any reason to exist. Besides, I know from Herr Hindi that the Bey paid for his refrigeration unit in cash.\" \"True enough.\" Ysidro lifted the lid of the honey pot, brought up a spoonful, and let it run down again in a column of shining amber. \"Yet at short notice he would have used a bank draft. I believe a ticket on the Orient Express is twenty pounds? Another two pounds to London, plus the costs of hotels and meals... maybe a total of sixty pounds? Find a draft of that, to someone of Hungarian name. Even incognito, a noble will usually take one of his lesser titles. Karolyi\u0027s are Leukovina, Feketelo, and Mariaswalther, if I recall my genealogies aright. My guess is he will have used one of those.\" Ysidro covered the honey again and stood; Margaret sprang up to fetch his cloak, which lay like a dense black winding sheet over a nearby chair. She asked brightly, \"Will you be back tonight?\" Ysidro seemed to settle into stillness, considering her with eyes that looked, in the lamplight, as gold as the honey. \"My errand should take me no great time.\" He pulled on his gloves and held out one hand to Lydia. \"It is true that the Dead travel fast.\" It was still impossible to see him leave a room. \"Frankly, I\u0027ve always wondered how they do,\" remarked Lydia, spooning honey onto a chunk of bread. \"And considering the fuss he made about traveling in the daytime...\" But the slamming of the bedroom door was her only answer. For a moment Lydia considered knocking and asking what real or fancied slight Margaret suffered from now. But it would only provoke another tantrum, another spate of incoherent romanticism about the eternal bond carried across lifetimes, and she felt simply too weary to go through with it. Margaret had coolly refused Lydia\u0027s offer yesterday of instruction in the intricacies of cosmetic art. Lydia was still unsure whether she was being blamed for Ysidro\u0027s absence from Margaret\u0027s dreams, for finding clues where Ysidro had missed them, or for some other offense entirely. And indeed, she thought with a stirring of old anger, it was Ysidro\u0027s fault as much as Margaret\u0027s. More, in fact, for originating the whole silly vaudeville of romance and need and lies. She put from herself in disgust the concern she had been feeling for him and ladled lamb and stuffed aubergines onto her plate, cursing Ysidro tiredly for his command that for safety the girls share bedroom and bed. It was not anything she was looking forward to tonight. The meal made her feel better. She spread out her papers again, jotting down the names Ysidro had mentioned and seeking them among the lists of drafts drawn at the end of October, but it was difficult to keep her mind on her work. She was angry at Ysidro and, she realized, hurt. Disillusioned. But what illusion had she held, she wondered, that she felt robbed of it now? The illusion that behind those bleached, crystalline eyes still lurked a living man\u0027s smile? Don Simon Xavier Christian Morado de la Cadena-Ysidro had been dead since 1558. She recalled the books on his parlor chest. A dead man might read medical journals, and mathematics texts, and volumes of logic. But would a dead man read the stories of Toad and Ratty and Mole? She took off her spectacles, leaned her forehead on her hands. And why should it matter to her whether he was dead inside or alive? In the street below, the dogs began to bark. Lydia raised her head, startled, and looked at the clock. It was nearly three. Had she been asleep, she wondered, since Margaret\u0027s huffy departure, or had she wakened from her first sleep later than she\u0027d thought? Below in the street, someone pounded on the outer gate. \"Hamam, hamam!\" cried a voice, vaguely familiar, though she could not have said from where. \"Hamam, it is your husband! Your husband!\" She jerked to her feet, ran to the window that overlooked the street. She pushed aside the chains of garlic and wild rose that hung there, unhooked the heavy lattice; down below she could see a cluster of dim shapes in a lantern\u0027s blurry light. \"Where?\" \"Your husband!\" cried the man below. \"Find you, he say.\" The hakdwati shair, she thought. The man in the yellow turban. Catching up the lamp from the table, she paused only long enough to snatch her silver knife as a precautionary measure and then ran downstairs. They\u0027d want money, she thought, stepping through the door out into the carriageway. As the light of the lamp jostled huge shadows over the carriageway\u0027s vaulted roof, she thought, Good heavens, they could be thieves for all I know... She stood on tiptoe to slide back the cover of the judas in the main gate, and tried to hold the lamp so that light would illuminate the faces of those who stood outside. There was no one in the street. Behind her, the house door slammed. Lydia whirled, her breath stopping in her lungs-a glance showed her that both the main outer gate and the small postern were firmly locked and bolted. The silence seemed suddenly, dreadfully alive. She strode back toward the door, cold with terror, pulling the silver table knife from her belt... The lamp in her hand went out. Instinct more than anything else made her flatten at once to the wall. Shadow moved in the dark arch where the carriageway let into the little courtyard, where fallen pomegranate leaves made spots like dripped blood in the thin moonlight; she threw the lamp with all her force in that direction and heard it strike something soft, then shatter on the pavement. In that instant she flung herself to the door, yanked the handle, and felt the heavy jar of the bolt. She whirled and slashed at the shadow that she felt more than saw suddenly beside her. She slashed, felt it give, turn before her. For an instant crushing pressure seized her wrist, a hand hideously strong closed over her throat, and with her mind swimming in a curious, hazy dream state she saw a face close to hers: smooth, full, olive-complected, fangs gleaming behind a thick mustache. Then he cried, \"Orospu!\" and his hand jerked away, and she cut at his face again, knowing she couldn\u0027t let him get near enough to take her by the elbow, the waist, someplace where she wasn\u0027t wearing silver. She tried to scream, but it came out thick and tiny, like a child\u0027s wailing in a dream; a vision flashed through her mind of letting him seize her, of wanting to feel those iron arms holding her, pressing her close to that iron chest. She cut again at his face and cursed as hands seized her arms above the elbow, gasped out the worst word she\u0027d ever heard from the grave diggers who brought bodies into the infirmary for dissection and felt the claws tear her arms, ripping through her sleeves. She kicked and slashed and cursed at the face that she saw now as if through the muzzy darkness of a dream. There were two of them, she thought, blindly terrified, hacking and twisting against a grip like devil-inhabited stone. Two of them, two faces in the patchy moon shadows... Then she was alone, leaning against the stuccoed wall with the knife shaking in her hand. Her sleeves were torn, the blood shockingly hot against flesh that seemed to be getting colder by the minute. I can\u0027t go into shock, she thought, from what seemed like a great distance off. I can\u0027t let myself... \"Madonna...\" Darkness came out of the deeper dark behind her, though she hadn\u0027t heard the gate open or close-a glint of eyes and the smoke of pale hair. Cold hands seized her arms, icy despite the frost that seemed to be spreading through her own flesh. She sobbed something, she didn\u0027t know what, pressed her face to the damp wool of a cloak that smelled of dew and graveyards, as if its weight could save her from the fanged brown face that had come so close to hers. She was unable to breathe, barely felt the cold, gloved hands that thrust her hair back from her face, touched her neck. \"Are you hurt?\" The words had no meaning to her. She considered them from a great distance away, turning them-for she seemed to have all the time in the world-one way and another, like a rare bone. Was she hurt? she wondered. For a moment she floated weightless against him, conscious, it seemed, of the skeleton within his clothing, like Death in his winding sheet... conscious of almost nothing else. She heard him say her name, or thought she did, and looking up she saw, at some unbridgeable distance, the face of a living man. He called her name again, and she gasped, shaken, disoriented, but alive once more, and stepped back quickly from him so that he had to catch her elbow to keep her from falling. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" she managed to say. She looked around the courtyard. Everything seemed very distant and odd, as if nothing had anything to do with her. Shock, she diagnosed. The silver knife lay on the ground at her feet, the smashed lamp beneath the pomegranate tree. She wondered how much it would cost to replace. \"I didn\u0027t mean-\" \"Are you hurt?\" Her blood gleamed all over his gloves from the talon rakes of her arms, but she knew he didn\u0027t mean that. \"No.\" \"You\u0027re sure?\" She nodded and felt her throat. She\u0027d unbuttoned her high collar before she\u0027d taken her nap, but the chains of silver were still there, close against the untouched skin. She bent to pick up the knife and nearly fell; he caught her in his arms as if she\u0027d been a child, and with a single, vicious kick cracked the door bolt and carried her inside. \"You\u0027re freezing.\" He set her in a chair in the small downstairs hall; shut the door again and put a second chair under its latch to hold it. Then he turned back to her and wrapped her in the pall of his cloak. \"And afraid.\" The fear she felt was only now coming into focus; she had not been conscious of much during the attack itself. She wondered why. In the drift of light from the lamp on the landing he looked at his hands, gloved in leather and blood. With a quick gesture he tore the gloves off and threw them on the stairs, and vanished through the dark doorway into the kitchen. He came back a few moments later, coatless and carrying a pottery basin of water and another lamp, which Lydia found profoundly comforting. As he set the lamp on the hall table, he paused to listen at the foot of the stairs, and for some reason she remembered him, white-robed and barefoot, picking knacker\u0027s meat from its paper for his cats. \"She is safe,\" he said, his voice very soft. \"They have not been inside. My apologies for the water. The boiler is long cold.\" Lydia wondered what he heard of Margaret\u0027s breathing: the peaceful snuffling of sleep or the swift, thready pant of guilt and fear and feelings hideously torn? She looked across at the door bolt, but even had the glow of the single lamp been stronger, the violence of Ysidro\u0027s breaking in had shaken loose the hasp from the bar, and it was impossible to tell whether the bolt had been shot behind her when she\u0027d gone out, or had merely somehow slipped. He put the cloak back from her arms, pulled the remains of the sleeve free with a single flick of his hand and reached into the basin for a sponge. The wounds were little more than scratches, but smarted horribly. Lydia flinched from the water, which was, as Ysidro had hinted, stone cold. \"I saw the interloper,\" she said, gritting her teeth. To her own vast annoyance she had begun to tremble again and couldn\u0027t seem to stop. With grim effort she kept her voice steady. A woman in hysterics was the last thing either of them needed. Besides, he\u0027d want the information quickly. \"He\u0027s a Turk, I think, I... I didn\u0027t get a clear look. Here,\" she added suddenly, realizing how disturbing he must find the smell of blood, \"I\u0027ll do that. There\u0027s some brandy in the pantry...\" He\u0027d brought napkins as well, but she was unable to bind up her own arms with them and had to wait till he returned after all. \"There were two of them,\" she resumed, while he pinned the bandages, white fingers neat and swift and chill as the touch of death. \"I think... I didn\u0027t see the other clearly but I don\u0027t think he was a Turk.\" \"Was he vampire?\" She hadn\u0027t thought of that. \"I... I don\u0027t know.\" Their voices echoed strangely in the well of the hallway, shadows leaning over them, monstrous and upside down. Ysidro left again, carrying the basin and sponge. When he returned, he held a cup of tea cradled in his hands, the smell of it gently neutral, like sunlight on grass. \"They... they called to me from the street... Or I thought someone called to me from the street. They said Jamie needed me.\" \"I doubt there was ever anyone in the street,\" Ysidro said softly. \"He will have felt your mind, a little, at the tomb, and with that little he could fool you about what you saw in darkness. You were right, the turbe of Al-Bayad was one of his sleeping places... He will have others.\" \"But you found nothing of Anthea? Or Ernchester?\" \"Nothing.\" He went to the hall table and stood for a moment, holding his hand near the flame of the lamp there to warm it. The fire, moving in its little red- glass bowl, lent his fingers, his hair, the skull-like ridges of his no- longer-human face a mockery of sunburnt health. \"Like him, she will change her sleeping place from night to night, and his glamour will work on her mind as well, hiding him from her, even as it hides her from the Master of Constantinople-and hides her from me. If your husband is alive at all, it is because the Master of Constantinople seeks to use him as bait to trap her, for he fears her, even as Grippen does.\" \"Grippen?\" said Lydia. \"Isn\u0027t he her master, as he is Ernchester\u0027s?\" \"It is not unheard of, for fledgings to turn against those that get them.\" He turned his hand over. The light seemed to shine through his fingers like parchment, illuminating spidery bones. \"It takes great strength, and great anger... but then, Anthea is strong. He has always distrusted her, as all masters distrust their get; and between Anthea and Grippen has always lain a most delicate balance of wariness, and power, and hate. I do not think he would have made her vampire had not he thought he would lose Charles when Anthea, still a mortal woman, died.\" \"So they didn\u0027t... they weren\u0027t made vampires at the same time.\" \"No. Charles was forty, Anthea thirty-three, when Grippen took Charles. Anthea was a widow for over thirty years. She had grown old when Charles finally came for her- or got Gnppen to come. She hated Gnppen for holding the dominance of a master over her, but she understood that it was the gate she had to walk through if she would be with Charles again. It is... a rather sad tale. Will you have more?\" She shook her head. As he took the cup from her, she saw how his clothing hung on him, as if there were nothing inside it but bones. The turned-back cuffs of his shirt showed wrist bones knobbed like hazelnuts under milk-white skin. \"Thank you,\" she said softly. He made a move, as if he would take her hand, then stopped himself. For a long time their eyes held, and she thought, quite irrationally, There is something else to say. It was he who moved his face aside, still for a moment, then turning fully to look at the door. \"I will remain here until it nears dawn, though I doubt he will be back. Tomorrow the bolt of the door can be repaired, and things placed about the doorsills and the windows that he cannot pass. I have no doubt he learned from Karolyi that you were here and wanted to put you under his influence-to force you to tell what Karolyi has been trying to persuade from you, did you but know it.\" Lydia shivered, thinking of the long climb to the bedroom. Even Margaret\u0027s presence in the bed beside her seemed welcome now. Ysidro put his head a little to one side, listening. \"She sleeps now.\" He started to speak again, then didn\u0027t, as if he, like Lydia for the moment, did not wish to raise the issue of Margaret, and his use of Margaret, between them. There is something else, Lydia thought again as they stood together, looking at one another in the lamplight. But Ysidro turned away and settled himself in the chair she had occupied, folding his bony arms within the shirt that seemed too large for him. Lydia slipped the cloak from her shoulders, and when he took it, slowly climbed the stairs. As Ysidro had said, Margaret was asleep. She\u0027d loosened her corsets and pulled the pins from her hair but still was dressed, as if she\u0027d fallen asleep huddled wretchedly on top of the covers, and in the glow of the bedside lamp her face was taut with unhappy dreams. Lydia\u0027s hands shook as she unbuttoned her torn shirtwaist, for reaction was settling on her. She had no intention of turning out the lamp beside the bed, but it was too bright for easy sleep. As she walked around to it, she saw half a dozen sheets of paper on the floor around Margaret\u0027s basket of crocheted flowers. They were tumbled untidily, as if she had been reading them when sleep overcame her and they\u0027d slid from the coverlet. When Lydia picked them up, she saw the handwriting, precise and black and, though the ink was clearly modern, nothing that had been seen since the days of Elizabeth. They were sonnets. About darkness. About mirrors. About roads untrodden stretching endlessly into night. One of them Margaret had ripped into quarters. Lydia had to lay it on the nightstand to fit its pieces together again. And she understood. Blood on marble-petals of a rose- Or copper-dark upon the lion\u0027s paw; Brightness and heat, like wine drunk red and raw. Wine vends dreams, but life in lifeblood flows. Thus warmth from flesh to flesh the blood imparts, A ruby heat reviving life and mind. Where can hunger better substance find than sanguine fire drawn from living hearts? I\u0027ve seen a brightness dwells not in the veins- In thinking eyes, and smiles that shame despair. Color and heat beyond what blood contains- Rose and copper in cheek and lips and hair. But flesh that can\u0027t be warmed by such a fire To only blood and silence may aspire. The papers were creased, as if they\u0027d been wadded small- hidden in the crochet basket, she thought, or in Margaret\u0027s carpetbag. She wondered at what point Margaret had found them and pocketed them for her own. She laid them back on the floor where they had been and turned down the light.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/traveling-with-the-dead-james-asher-2/page-19.html","bookId":2490,"book":{"id":2490,"title":"Traveling with the Dead (James Asher #2)","description":"Storyline: Traveling with the Dead (James Asher #2) Down through the deathless centuries, the vampires had drunk human blood for sustenance and for sport.
