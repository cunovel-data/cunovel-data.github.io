He\u0027d been wakened hours earlier by gunshots in the streets, had lain listening as the sounds of horror-driven fury, the random ululation of violence, ebbed and then flared like the sullen quarreling of a drunkard who returns again and again to the wellsprings of his rage.\\n\\n It was deep in the night, probably not many hours until dawn, when he heard them coming toward the house. Even in the Tientsin riots, the worst he\u0027d known, this was the hour when such things quieted. Something, someone, was stirring them up, rousing them anew when they flagged.\\n\\n And for the first time he could hear, among the confused buzzing shouts, words that he knew.\\n\\n Vlokslak. Hortolak. Ordog.\\n\\n They were coming to burn the House of Oleanders.\\n\\n The vampires will flee, he thought.\\n\\n Olumsiz Bey will kill me, rather than let me tell others what I\u0027ve seen.\\n\\n The spotted light of the stairway lamp still outlined the open door.\\n\\n The thought of getting up appalled him. Just breathing was like being struck in the side with an ax. He rolled carefully off the divan and managed to get on his feet- achingly glad that a Turkish divan wasn\u0027t even as high as the average milking stool the floor icy under bare soles, cold breathing around his ankles and stirring the long cotton shirt that someone had put on him when they brought him upstairs. He found his clothes farther along the divan, and put them on sitting. The boots were the worst. His bandaged arm ached and the stab of his broken ribs left him breathless as he pulled them on, but he knew the streets of Constantinople and knew he\u0027d need them.\\n\\n To his enormous surprise, he made it to the door on his feet. The house below was soundless. They\u0027d probably break in on the other side, through the crypt where the ice was delivered. If he met them in the crypt, they\u0027d quite possibly kill him out of hand before they realized he wasn\u0027t a vampire himself.\\n\\n Descending the stairs left him dizzy, but he didn\u0027t fall. The thing in the crypt hadn\u0027t been able to drink much of his blood, though a good deal had been lost. He felt desperately thirsty. Down in the courtyard the sound of the mob didn\u0027t penetrate, and it was hard to disregard the voice in the back of his mind that argued that he certainly had time to lie down on the nice, comfortable pavement and rest a little...\\n\\n He took the vigil lamp from its niche and continued. In the Turkish part of the house the mob\u0027s fury sounded closer, a heavy sea surge that would stop at nothing.\\n\\n The tiled room. The overgrown court. The Roman baths. The long stair and the stench of ammonia, of wet brick...\\n\\n Of decay.\\n\\n The leopard glimmer of the lamp suddenly outlined the dark form standing before him. The light gleamed in the citrine eyes and on the silver blade of the halberd, and Asher, leaning panting on the wall, knew he had lost.\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t even the strength to turn and flee; the Bey would pull him down like a staghound a crippled fawn. Throwing the lamp would buy him seconds, but...\\n\\n \"God sent you,\" the vampire said softly. \"Help me. I beg you.\"\\n\\n He stepped forward, holding out one hand with its steel talons and winking jewels. \"The others have fled. I have to get him someplace where the mob will not find him, have to get enough ice there, that he will live through the night.\"\\n\\n In the corridor behind him, when Asher moved the lamp, he could see the wet diamond glint of ice where it showed through the oilskin in which it was wrapped. Masses of it, far more than a living man could carry. But even with a vampire\u0027s strength, he could not make it more wieldy. He couldn\u0027t carry it, and a body as well, up those twisting stairs.\\n\\n \"Please,\" the Bey said. \"After that you may do as you will. I have the keys to the outer doors, you are free to go. On my honor, by the Prophet I swear it. But help me get him to safety. Please.\"\\n\\n Asher set down the lamp. \"Is he able to walk at all?\"\\n\\n The Bey stepped forward, some of the terrible tension lifting from the set of his shoulders, the angle of his shaven head. His snake-colored eyes seemed suddenly old, filled with the weariness of uncounted years alone. \"With support, I thmk. We weigh not so heavy as living flesh.\"\\n\\n Asher touched his arm, staying him as they edged between the ice blocks and the wall, to the silver bars that guarded the corridor to the crypts. The last time they were eye-to-eye had been here, with the Bey\u0027s claws lodged deep in his throat. Those wounds throbbed under a dressing of sticking plaster every time he spoke.\\n\\n \"You know it\u0027s not going to do you any good.\" He spoke, not in triumph, but in a kind of matter-of-fact compassion, for the creature beyond the bars was clearly beyond hope even if, by some miracle, Ernchester or some other vampire could be found to complete his transformation to the vampire state.\\n\\n He half expected the same rage that, earlier in the night, had almost killed him, but the Bey only shook his head.\\n\\n \"If he can get through the night,\" he murmured. \"If he can last through another day... The... transformation... of the flesh, when it takes place, is little short of miraculous. I have seen sere and aged crones return to the beauty of their girlhood once they have the power of the vampire mind. The flesh returns to the form that is in the mind. And in any case,\" he added, still more quietly, \"though what you say may be true, I cannot leave him. He is... dear to me.\"\\n\\n The body that the Bey brought forth from the crypt was wrapped in a sort of shroud of oiled silk, with oilskins on top of that. Still it stank, a limp and filthy thing in the tall vampire\u0027s arms, its wet black curls glistening between the bandages, its dangling fingers dripping brownish fluid. Asher flinched back from it, remembering the slimy lips mumbling at his arm, as the Bey set it on its feet beside him; his shoulders cringed from the limp arm the Bey laid over them. Then the bandaged head lolled, like a drunken man\u0027s, and the livid eyelids, almost black in the gloom, rose to show dark eyes flooded with agony, horror, and dumb pleading for relief.\\n\\n The thing lived.\\n\\n \"He was beautiful,\" whispered Olumsiz Bey. He bent, gathering the corners of the oilcloth around the ice. He had laid down his silver halberd to carry the thing from the crypt, the first time Asher had seen him let it out of his hand. Now he slipped it through the knot of the oilskins, the haft where he could grip it at once. There must have been several hundred pounds of ice, but he lifted it easily, for it was only the awkwardness of it that had prevented him from bearing both it and the boy leaning, weaving drunkenly, on his shoulders. At close range the smell was suffocating, and he tried not to think about the consistency of the arm that held so desperately to his neck. He himself, with his cracked ribs sawing like broken bamboo within him, could barely keep his feet.\\n\\n \"Beautiful,\" the Bey said, \"and more beautiful still in his heart. He was ardent as fire, my Kahlil. A young warrior, and loyal to me to the bottom of his soul.\" It was as if he heard Asher\u0027s thought, And you repaid him thus? But Asher did not speak it, so there was no anger in the vampire\u0027s quiet reply.\\n\\n \"He would have been one of my living servants, here in this house. This was what I had planned.\" The shouting of the mob was very near, the sky above the tall Turkish roof-usually so dark-smoldering with the flare of torches. Smoke and rage burned the air.\\n\\n \"This was hard for me. I wanted to make him as I am, to keep him by me in his glorious youth forever. But I knew this was no longer possible for me. Fifty, sixty years ago, in the days of Abdul Mezid, when my friend Tinnin was killed, I tried to make a fledgling. Though that youth\u0027s mind stayed alive, a burning flame in mine through the death of his body, when I returned that flame to the flesh, there was no change, no alteration in the flesh itself. The fledgling rotted as he lay until in mercy I struck off his head. This had happened... once, maybe twice before to me, long ago. But afterward all was well. This time-after Tinnin- the power did not return.\"\\n\\n He laughed soundlessly, bitterly, a tall figure in robes mottled like a tiger\u0027s in the shifting light. The jewels he wore threw back fire from the reddish glare of the sky, echoes of it catching in the ice he carried like some monstrous, Sisyphean gem loaded onto him by hilarious gods.\\n\\n \"I tried three, perhaps four times since that time, and I knew there was little chance of bringing Kahlil across to the vampire state. And I knew this was God\u0027s mockery of me: that having found the one I could trust, the one who could help me, I had squandered my gift of dark immortality on such as Zardalu and the Baykus Kadine, and that cobweb witch Zenaida who hides in the old harem, only because I needed those I could command to do my bidding.\\n\\n \"And then the interloper came.\"\\n\\n The stairs from the old bans court were the worst. Where it had been silent, now the shouting was clearly audible, and drifts of smoke swirled harsh in the air. Asher abandoned the lamp to its niche again, his own injuries stabbing him as he struggled to help the shrouded form up the long flights, the Bey at his heels with the huge, unwieldy burden of dripping ice.\\n\\n \"Golge Kurt,\" said the Bey\u0027s soft voice, almost as if it were in his ear, while beneath the bandages Kahlil made soft, broken noises of pain. \"The Shadow Wolf. God knows where he came from, or how he came to be vampire. Some Greek witch, no doubt, whom he later escaped... But he is a Turk of the new Turks, this upland peasantry that they\u0027ve given guns and delusions of rule. I saw him first just after the coup, when all the city was in confusion. He had made a fledgling already- as easy as spitting-to challenge my power. I killed the fledgling-but I could not kill him. And after that I had no choice.\"\\n\\n They reached the long upper chamber. Asher sank, hand pressed to his side, onto the divan, the wrapped and shrouded living corpse beside him. While the Bey unfurled his oilskin to let the ice clatter down, filling the dry tiles of the fish pool, Kahlil, instead of lying on the divan, remained sitting beside Asher, clinging to him, as if frantic for the comfort of a living touch. Stinking, rotting, horrible within the bandages, but Asher could not thrust him away.\\n\\n The Bey came back, tenderly lifted the boy\u0027s body and carried it to the ice. Watching them in the juddering orange flare of the lamps around the walls, Asher wondered bitterly how many men fell back on that phrase, I had no choice, when it came to what they wanted-even when it did that to those they loved.\\n\\n Ernchester, when he had killed Cramer.\\n\\n Karolyi, certainly, if he thought at all.\\n\\n He himself.\\n\\n Olumsiz Bey knelt on the steps of the basin, holding the putrefying bundle that had been the boy\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"So you tried to make him vampire,\" Asher said quietly. \"Even though you knew.\"\\n\\n The Bey nodded, once.\\n\\n \"And when you saw that though his mind survived, his body was beginning to rot, you sent for Ernchester.\"\\n\\n \"I could rule him,\" the Bey said simply. \"I knew him. I knew he was weak. He could get fledglings but had not the strength to command them. Once away from that woman of his-\"\\n\\n \"Who loves him,\" Asher said. \"Who cares for him, as you care for Kahlil.\"\\n\\n The Bey did not even look up at that, didn\u0027t take his eyes from his friend; only shook his head, a heavy, animal gesture, impatient and puzzled, as if he truly did not understand what Asher said. \"Women don\u0027t love. Not like men. Not like a man loves one who is the son he would have chosen out of all souls in the Universe. No love is like that.\"\\n\\n No, thought Asher. A vampire to the end, even to the nature of his love.\\n\\n The Bey did not even pause to speculate, to justify. His love was unique, and because it was-and because it was his-that justified all. He went on, \"But without the Sultan\u0027s power, I had to find what help I could. A savage, Karolyi, for all his civilized manners. A Magyar Hun. I think he had already begun to guess at what I was before I sent for his help. I think he had already wondered what use he-in the name of his country-could make of the Undead.\"\\n\\n He leaned over to touch the forehead of the boy who lay now unmoving in his bed of ice. The great uneven blocks were old, dried and cleared and slick; they caught the feeble ember light like monster diamonds, faceting it to a wild rainbow over the walls, as if from a bier of jewels.\\n\\n \"I was able to hold Golge Kurt at bay for a time-I think ail would have been well, had not Karolyi chosen to make what he could of the chance, to try to force Ernchester into the service of his country.\" His eyes, in their dark hollows, were dying coals of some old rage. \"Country. We the Undead at least were human once. Our sins are human sin. Magnified a million times, but human. These countries, these nations-they are not human. They care not what they use, so long as it serves them. They care not what they do, and their sins are far beyond ours, literally of a different nature. You have served them. Karolyi told me that, Karolyi who is hollow inside, nothing inside, because this \u0027country\u0027 requires that he be nothing. You know.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Asher said, remembering again. \"I know.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"And so Karolyi delayed. And Golge Kurt was able to gain a little more territory, to learn a little more of the city. I fear that when Ernchester tried to come into the city to obey my summons, he was met by Golge Kurt and made a prisoner, and a slave. I thought that if I could trap the woman through you, I could draw Ernchester to me... Or at the worst, use her to make Kahlil whole. But it did not come about. And now it is finished.\"\\n\\n Shouts rang in the courtyard, echoing from distant regions of the house. In the windows that ringed each shallow dome, the sky was red, like a cloth used to mop blood. The Bey reached in his robe, threw something to Asher that caught a spangle of the light as it flew. It was a key.\\n\\n \"Go,\" he said. \"First light is not far off. They\u0027ll be gone before then, and they will not come here. They will not even realize there is a stairway, though they stand at its foot looking up. Such is still my power.\" After a moment\u0027s thought he took the halberd and slid it across the floor to him, the silver blade flashing.\\n\\n \"You may meet one of them still,\" he added. \"If it is Golge Kurt, kill him. Not for me. He is a man of the new breed who will try to buy power from whatever country he thinks will give it him. And he will buy it with any terms they ask. He is like your Karolyi. I only wanted one fledgling. They will want hundreds, loyal to their service. And what will come of that I do not wish to think.\"\\n\\n He shook his heavy head, turned back to the boy in the ice. His voice was so low as to be almost inaudible, like the murmur of a fading ghost. \"And-thank you, Scheherazade. Thank you for your help.\"\\n\\n Asher stood in the doorway for a moment, leaning on the silver halberd, shivering, for he had stripped off his death-stinking coat and only the piercing cold prevented him from shedding his shirt as well.\\n\\n How many had the Bey killed? wondered Asher, looking at the bowed form in its golden robes beside the pathetic, shrouded figure on its jeweled pyre of ice. As many as a war, certainly. Karolyi would justify himself the same way-as he, Asher, had justified himself, time and again. At the time he may even have been right.\\n\\n Painfully, clinging to the halberd for support, Asher made his way down the long stairs.\\n\\n In the courtyard the noise was louder, echoing from the archway that led to the Byzantine house. Shouts, and the crash of precious things breaking, the thud of running feet. Smoke rolled in, burning his eyes and catching in the light-too much, too strong, for torches. Some part of the house was in flames.\\n\\n Legs shaking, Asher leaned on the column at the foot of the stair and wondered if he had enough strength left to make it down the colonnade, across the overgrown court, through the crypts...\\n\\n And home, he thought.\\n\\n If Golge Kurt became Master of Constantinople-and Asher knew it lay beyond his strength, now, to stop him-it was only a matter of time before Karolyi, or some Young Turk just as eager for his country\u0027s triumph, convinced him to become a weapon of the state.\\n\\n And then a new age would come indeed.\\n\\n He would tell Clapham, though he knew Clapham wouldn\u0027t believe. Even the redoubtable Lady Clapham would think his ravings delirium. One had to be born to it, raised in it, as Karolyi had been, to believe quickly... quickly enough.\\n\\n Razumovsky would believe, and Razumovsky would help him home... but Razumovsky would make a deal with Karolyi for what he could get. Bulgaria for you-India for us.\\n\\n And the infection would spread.\\n\\n Something dark rushed through the archway into the court, making straight for the stair. It paused before him, dark eyes flaring in the lamplight, and Asher realized, tardily, who it was. Tall for a Turk, with a Turk\u0027s black hair and scimitar nose, a feral bristle of mustache... the eyes were indeed the eyes of a wolf. All this he saw in less than a second; Asher didn\u0027t even have time to raise the halberd from its position as a crutch to that of a weapon when the vampire struck him aside, the impact with the wall like a sword in his side.\\n\\n Breath left him and wouldn\u0027t return, and when he opened his eyes again the vampire was partway up the stairs, lithe and silent as a lion in his torn khaki rags.\\n\\n Asher thought, grimly, I have to pursue... but knew he was incapable of catching him, of moving more than a step or so without agony...\\n\\n And Golge Kurt was not alone. Asher had seen vampires run-eerily weightless and without a sound-and knew the second dark form that streamed in like smoke and bones was a vampire as well. Even before he realized it was Ysidro-Ysidro?-the vampire of London, gaunt and starved and ghastly, fell upon Golge Kurt like a silent falcon with a talon-rip at his throat that would have ex-sanguinated him had he not, impossibly, heard and turned at the last instant to meet the attack.\\n\\n The two closed, fell, locked together on the steps, ripping at one another with clawlike nails, and seconds later a third vampire emerged from the dark, sprang up the steps. Him Asher knew at once, though in a strange way he seemed to have changed even more than Ysidro. When they last had spoken, by the flame light of the burning sanitarium in the Vienna Woods, Ernchester, if torn by indecision and grief, at least had been his own man. Now his face was empty, faded as the rags of his old black coat and filthy trousers, his blue eyes pieces of dirty glass. He caught Ysidro by the arms, dragging him back from the silent, slashing tangle on the steps, and held him while Golge Kurt whipped a long soldier\u0027s knife from his belt. Ysidro took one cut across the chest before he kicked the blade aside, another across the face as he slid bonelessly free of Ernchester\u0027s grip...\\n\\n Then twisted as a pistol roared in the enclosing walls of the court. Ernchester and Golge Kurt stood frozen, as between them Ysidro sank like a broken thing to the steps.\\n\\n Ignace Karolyi stepped from the colonnade on the other side of the court. \"Go,\" he said. He had an army pistol in his hand, the barrel smoking. \"I\u0027ll finish him.\" He spoke German.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s faking.\" Golge Kurt looked down at the crumpled tangle of black and white at the foot of the steps. Blood glittered darkly on his face and throat where Ysidro\u0027s claws had ripped, but there was no sweat, nor did he pant-in fact, he did not breathe at all. \"I never saw bullet stop one of us yet.\"\\n\\n Karolyi grinned. \"My dear Kurt, you\u0027ve never heard of silver bullets? They\u0027re a sovereign remedy for Evil. You\u0027ll have to look out for them, when you\u0027re working for us.\"\\n\\n Golge Kurt\u0027s dark eyes glittered warily on the last sentence, but he made a smile, a demon manufacturing one for human consumption. \"Even so. Sharl...\"\\n\\n Charles Farren, third Earl of Ernchester, had come down the steps to kneel beside Ysidro\u0027s body, his hand pressed to his mouth. \"Simon,\" he whispered, half unbelieving, and Asher, still leaning against the wall in the warehouse bay\u0027s concealing shadow, knew then that it was true. It was, somehow, Ysidro. \"Simon ...\"\\n\\n \"Come.\" Golge Kurt had mounted a step, half turned back, and Asher remembered how Olumsiz Bey had spoken to Zardalu that night in the garden.\\n\\n Ernchester looked up, his face struggling to regain an expression, some sign of life. The air was nauseating with the smell of blood. \"This man...\" he said haltingly.\\n\\n \"Come.\"\\n\\n He did not touch him, did not make a move, but Ernchester flinched. Vampires do not generally show age, but Ernchester\u0027s face, thought Asher, was lined and haggard with the weight of centuries of immortality in which he had never, for one moment, been free.\\n\\n He rose to his feet and followed. The two vampires passed like shadows up the stairs.\\n\\n Karolyi crossed the court, cocking the pistol as he moved. From the shadows of the bay where Asher stood it was three long strides to the foot of the stairs, too long to move without taking a bullet in the chest himself. Still, the key was in his hand, ready to throw as a distraction to buy himself time to spring, when a voice called out from the passageway to the house, \"Mr. Karolyi!\" and Karolyi turned in surprise.\\n\\n If Asher hadn\u0027t spent seventeen years on Her Majesty\u0027s Service dealing with the absolutely unexpected, he would have thought, Lydia??? in sheer, baffled, horrified shock... and lost the split second her distraction bought him. He knew it was Lydia\u0027s voice even as he was moving, two fast strides, slashing down with the silver halberd blade at Karolyi\u0027s neck. The Austrian spun, his bullet cracking the pink plaster of the arch through which Asher came at him, and Asher reversed the halberd and caught Karolyi across the temple with the shaft.\\n\\n Karolyi fell back, dropping the gun, and grabbed for the halberd shaft. The two men grappled, and someone-absolutely and unmistakably Lydia-plunged out of the salon with a long bronze candlestick in hand whose weighted base she smashed into Karolyi\u0027s spine. Karolyi gagged, lurched; Asher kicked him hard in the belly, thrust him away, then stooped and snatched the pistol from the floor-at the same moment Lydia sprang back out of any possible range and stood panting, red hair everywhere, like a disheveled mermaid in a torn green gown and opera gloves, her neck a treasury of silver and pearls.\\n\\n Karolyi backed, his hands raised, panting. \"My dear Dr. Asher.\" Firelight from the windows of the Byzantine house made everything luridly clear in the court.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t shoot me, you know.\" There was a wryness, almost amusement, in his eyes, his voice; the same glint he\u0027d had in his eye when he saluted Asher as Asher was led away to the Vienna jail.\\n\\n It was a game. The Great Game.\\n\\n His clothes were rough, a laborer\u0027s clothes, spattered with mud and blood. His dark hair hung in his eyes. But his appearance, thus or in his gorgeous Hussar uniform, had always been only a disguise.\\n\\n Hollow inside, as the Bey had said.\\n\\n \"Silly niggers broke up the refrigeration coils in the crypt,\" he said. \"I heard them choking behind me. The place is chock-ablock with ammonia gas, and spreading. I know another way out.\"\\n\\n \"That true?\" Asher asked.\\n\\n Lydia nodded. She was well clear of them both, in the center of the court, firelight a carnival of brass and vermilion on her hair, her spectacles rounds of fire. \"We were directly behind them, Ysidro and I. He covered my face with his cloak...\" She glanced toward the silent, bleeding huddle at the foot of the stairs, but said nothing more.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll never get out of here without me.\" Karolyi lowered his hands a little.\\n\\n \"In fact you look hardly able to get yourself anywhere, if I may say so. They killed two of the Bey\u0027s servants already. We nearly fell over them in the alley. They\u0027re going to think you\u0027re exactly the same.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re not?\"\\n\\n He widened his eyes, amused. \"Who, me? You must know me better than that.\" \"He started the rioting,\" Lydia said quietly. \"He and the interloper.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, nonsense, madame, the Armenians have been itching for days to start fighting again.\" He turned back to Asher with a rueful grin. \"So we\u0027re stalemated, you see. And you\u0027d better make up your mind soon, because in another few minutes you\u0027re going to pass out and that would probably be a bad idea right now. At least I can get you-and more importantly your wife-out of here alive.\"\\n\\n He was right, Asher reflected. Every movement of his ribs was a sword cut, and he could feel his hands and feet growing cold. God knew what the mob would do to Lydia...\\n\\n \"Come now.\" Karolyi held out his hand. \"A temporary alliance, offensive and defensive. Nations do it all the time. You can\u0027t tell me I\u0027ve done anything you wouldn\u0027t have done yourself. You would have done exactly what I did, and for exactly the same reasons.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Asher, seeing again the whore in Paris and the beggar in the alley he hadn\u0027t helped. Cramer laughing as he suggested going to Notre Dame for a crucifix. The body of his Czech guide all those years ago in the Dinaric Alps.\\n\\n Fairport dying in the light of the burning sanitarium, and the last, baffled, uncomprehending look in Jan van der Platz\u0027s eyes. He felt strangely distant from himself, the world narrowing to the handsome face he had seen-what? almost three weeks ago-at Charing Cross. \"I would have. That\u0027s why I quit.\"\\n\\n And he shot Karolyi through the head.\\n\\n There seemed to be no transition between that and Lydia propping him up, holding him under the arms-it was the stab in his ribs that brought him back from momentary unconsciousness He clutched her convulsively against him, pressing his face to hers. \"Lydia...\"\\n\\n \"God, Jamie...\"\\n\\n It seemed absurd to ask her how she\u0027d tracked him. Ysidro, he thought, turning, even as she broke from him and ran to the vampire lying like a smashed kite on the bloody pavement.\\n\\n \"Simon...\"\\n\\n The skeleton hand moved, gripping hers. \"Go after them.\\n\\n \"You...\"\\n\\n \"I shall be well.\"\\n\\n She was already tearing his black evening coat aside, revealing the white shirt nearly as black with blood. \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous, you can\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \"It went through... I\u0027ll be ill for a time... the silver... burns...\" He raised his head, long hair falling back bloodied from his face. Surely, Asher thought, horrified, he had not looked like that when they had parted a year ago. \"Go.\"\\n\\n His hand pressed to his side and blood welled between the spidery fingers. \"Both must die. The man and the Undead with whom he made his bargain. It is your part of the pact, mistress,\" he added, still more softly. \"For this I came with you.\"\\n\\n Asher propped himself on the nearest archway and checked the revolver\u0027s chamber. Four bullets left, all silver. He started to say, Stay with him, but there was a crashing within the passageway to the house, renewed smoke and voices cursing.\\n\\n Madness fleered in the air. Instead he said, \"Stay behind me.\" But it was Lydia who helped him mount the stairs.\\n\\n The gallery stank like an abattoir of corruption and blood. The door stood open, and Asher stepped through quickly, gun held ready and his other hand clamped hard on Lydia\u0027s shoulder for support.\\n\\n The long room was still. The few lamps flung huge shadows, glistened stickily on black lakes of gore.\\n\\n It soaked the pile carpets, ran down the tiled steps to blend with the melting ice; splashed the walls, the columns, the divan. Asher took another step into the room, sickened, heart hammering, and in the heavy blackness made out shapes, the broken ruin of battle.\\n\\n That thing like a killed dragon, glittering with blood and jewels, was Olumsiz Bey. It was too dark to see well, but he looked as if most of his throat had been torn out and his intestines strewn among the ripped silk of the robes. It might have been a trick of the candle flame, but Asher thought he saw the movement of those orange eyes. Unsheathed and covered with blood, the silver knife lay in his open hand. Beside him was a broken form in a black coat, wounds curling, blistering, blackening with the burning of the silver, short fair hair soaked dark with grue. Asher said softly, \"Charles...\"\\n\\n And Ernchester moved. Spastic, desperate, unable to rise or speak, still he\\n\\n flung out his hand in warning. Asher turned, throwing himself against the wall, and fired at the shadow that fell upon him from the denser shadows near the door. The bullet went wild; he fired again, and blackness covered his mind, blinding him, followed by pain in his side, in his shoulder, his neck. He rolled, struck one of the pillars at the end of the hall and someone dragged him back against it-Lydia-and his head cleared in time to see Golge Kurt walking away toward the broken and bloodied forms of Ernchester and Olumsiz Bey. He moved unhurried, without the drifting, ghostly swiftness of Ysidro. Asher guessed he had not been vampire long.\\n\\n Lydia ripped free one of her gloves, fumbled with the tangle of silver and pearls around her throat. \"Put this on.\" She pressed a couple of chains into his hands. He realized Golge Kurt was between them and the distant door.\\n\\n Asher obeyed, knowing it would do no good.\\n\\n Olumsiz Bey was moving. Golge Kurt pressed the barrel of Karolyi\u0027s pistol to the older vampire\u0027s head and fired. The report was like a cannon in the long room.\\n\\n In the pit of ice the boy Kahlil cried out, a terrible sound; the Turk turned and fired at him from where he stood. The body jounced and lay still.\\n\\n Lamplight glittered on Golge Kurt\u0027s smile.\\n\\n \"I should give you to my friend, I think.\" He touched Ernchester with his foot.\\n\\n \"We are hurt, and the taste of death will make us feel better. But I think with the silver of the knife burning in his wounds, he may be hurt too much. So maybe I\u0027ll just have you both myself.\"\\n\\n He grinned wider, then threw back his head and laughed, the blood from Ysidro\u0027s talons running black down his face.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll hold him,\" Asher said very softly. \"You run for the door.\"\\n\\n She had to know it was hopeless, because she nodded. The silk whispered as she gathered handfuls of it to free her legs. \"I love you, Jamie.\"\\n\\n At the far end of the chamber the door closed, with a sound like the shutting of a tomb. The shadow standing just within it moved, turning the old-fashioned key.\\n\\n Candlelight flickered on the wicked, curving blade of the silver halberd.\\n\\n Golge Kurt turned his head.\\n\\n She stood there like a witch, like a thing truly risen from a nameless grave, filthy in her rags of luminous blue, blood in the curling raven ocean of her hair. The brown eyes had the weird sanity sometimes found on the far side of madness: calm, but a demon\u0027s eyes. There was blood on her mouth, and on her hands to the elbow, but the gold of her wedding band shone through.\\n\\n Golge Kurt pointed the gun at her and fired, and she was stepping forward even before the hammer clicked harmlessly on the empty chamber, and with a vicious blow of the silver halberd took the gun hand off at the wrist.\\n\\n The vampire screamed as blood exploded from the severed arteries, lunged at her only to be driven back with face and chest slashed, clutching, grabbing at the wounds where the silver blistered and burned. \"Orospu!\" he shrieked at her, rage inhuman in his eyes. \"Infidel whore!\"\\n\\n She stepped in toward him, slashing with the silver weapon, slicing open his legs, his feet, his thighs. When he tried to climb up the lamp niches, to spring from them to the windows of the dome, she cut the backs of his knees so that, when he fell back screaming with his remaining palm a fingerless charred wreck, he could not stand. And all the while her face did not change, nor did the tears cease to run from the empty demon eyes.\\n\\n Only when she had driven him into a corner, blood gushing from his wounds to splash her skirts, the walls, the floor, did she stop, looking at him with an inner peace beyond compassion or hate.\\n\\n \"You killed him,\" she said, quite gently. \"You let him take the brunt of the fight, let him destroy the master you hoped to supersede. You cared no more for him than he did, this Bey, this... this master. It will be day very soon,\" she said.\\n\\n Golge Kurt made a move to lunge, but with his hamstrings severed he could only flop on elbows and knees, while blood spattered around him like thick and stinking rain. She stood out of his range, looking down at him. Without turning her head she said, \"Charles?\"\\n\\n The broken form moved then, lying near Olumsiz Bey on the blood-sodden carpets; moved, and reached for her with one hand. No louder than the scratch of a single leaf blown across a marble floor, Asher thought he heard a voice whisper, \"Beloved...\"\\n\\n \"Beloved,\" she replied. Her voice shook a little, but she never took her eyes from Golge Kurt. \"You never did want this life, did you?\" she asked softly. \"Never wanted to continue, Undead but Unalive...\"\\n\\n \"... Don\u0027t... know.\" Ernchester moved his hand again, tried to raise his head. The guttering candles showed his throat cut almost to the hawse bone. Asher didn\u0027t even know whether the dying vampire was actually capable of making a sound.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t... remember... what I wanted. Only that I did not want to leave you.\"\\n\\n \"Nor I, to leave life,\" she replied. \"Not if your love was part of that life, no matter what the cost to my soul. Nights and nights and nights, killing that I might not die... and you killing, that you might stay here with me. Not so?\"\\n\\n \"I chose...\"\\n\\n She moved back to kneel at his side, though she still watched the Shadow Wolf, bleeding on the floor. One hand still held the master\u0027s silver weapon; the other reached down to touch the graying hair. \"I understand,\" she said. \"We all choose. And in a very short time it will be time for us both to go.\"\\n\\n Black eyes wide with horror now, Golge Kurt shouted at her, raged at her, cursed her in German and Turkish and broken French, and she listened with a face of stone.\\n\\n \"It is not I who brought him to this place,\" the vampire shouted. \"Not I who did this to him...\"\\n\\n \"It was you who met him among the tombs,\" Anthea said. \"You who used him, who controlled his mind, because he is what he is, weak... Don\u0027t you think I was aware of it, hiding among the cisterns and the catacombs of this city, when you two walked its streets to war with Olumsiz Bey? Don\u0027t you think I sensed it in my dreams, when you covered and hid his mind that he might not even know I followed and sought? To kill you is nothing.\"\\n\\n The yellow light edged her face as it edged the halberd\u0027s dripping blade. There was no sound, now, outside, and the windows above showed as squares of ash against the night.\\n\\n \"I have killed every night to stay alive. Brought victims to him to kill when he was so weary of the life he lived that he could not even go to seek his own. All because Grippen wanted him- and Olumsiz Bey wanted him-and you wanted him to keep him from the Bey. And all you wanted was rest, Charles.\"\\n\\n Charles shook his head and did not let go of her hand. \"No,\" he whispered. \"I wanted you.\"\\n\\n It was Golge Kurt whose flesh ignited first. It puckered, blistered, blackening as he crawled screaming for the door, and Anthea cut at him again and again with the silver halberd until he retreated, screaming, to the corner, where the fire took hold. It swelled up from within him, not great flame, but thick blue- burning sheets. He sank to the floor and ceased to move quite soon, but he continued to scream for some time.\\n\\n By that time Olumsiz Bey was burning as well, though Asher heard no sound from him. Perhaps he was dead, perhaps only lapsed into the vampire sleep that came at daylight, mercifully unaware of the end of his long unlife.\\n\\n Anthea, who had begun to nod with the onset of that same sleep, laid down the weapon she carried and knelt beside the man she had loved, gathering him up into her arms. Their mouths were pressed together as the fire took them, and neither moved, except to tighten their grip on one another until the very bones locked within the veils of heat. Lydia watched until the end, but Asher turned his face against her shoulder, the suffocating heat pounding him, nauseated with the stink of burning flesh and blind with tears. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/traveling-with-the-dead-james-asher-2/page-22.html","bookId":2490,"book":{"id":2490,"title":"Traveling with the Dead (James Asher #2)","description":"Storyline: Traveling with the Dead (James Asher #2) \\n Down through the deathless centuries, the vampires had drunk human blood for sustenance and for sport.
