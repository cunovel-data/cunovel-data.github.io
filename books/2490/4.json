{"id":105036,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"I have long deplored the manners of what fondly believes itself to be society these days.\" Lydia gasped as if she had been wakened by a freezing drench of water. The pale man took the sprayer weapon from her grasp with one hand and with the other pulled her to her feet, the strength of his fingers on her elbow such that she felt instinctively he could, had he so wished, have snapped the bone within the flesh. Past his shoulder she saw that the grille stood open, though she had been aware of no movement on the part of the dead man within the niche. For some moments, she realized, in a rush of frightened shock, she had been aware of nothing at all. He stood beside her now, thin and cold and utterly correct in his long white robe. His eyes, level with hers-for he was not a tall man-were a light, clear yellow, flecked with the brown-gray that wood turns when desiccated with age. He shoved her against the stone of the wall, and when he spoke, she could see the gleam of his fangs in the strangely reversed lamp glow. \"Not that proper manners, or genuine society, have existed in this country since the departure of the last of her true kings for France and the advent of that rabble of sausage-devouring German heretics and their hangers-on.\" There was no anger in his voice, nor wore his face any expression whatsoever, but his grip on her arm kept her pinned where she was. His hands were like marble-a dead man\u0027s hands. He went on, \"It has always been considered that a woman who sought a man out in his chamber while he slept did so at her peril.\" James was in danger. Later on Lydia realized that only that fact gave her courage to speak. Her single encounter with Ysidro had been part and parcel of a greater jeopardy, and in that instance, she had known where she stood. This was different. \"I had to speak to you. I came in the daylight so the others wouldn\u0027t know.\" He released her arm, but standing in the confines of the narrow stair, it was as if they embraced. She noted that no heat came from his body, and save for the very faint reek of old blood in the folds of his shroud, no smell. Except when he spoke, his body made no sound whatsoever, neither of breath nor of movement. All these data she observed, while aware that no analysis of them came anywhere near describing what he was like. She pushed up her spectacles. \"Lord Ysidro-Don Simon-I think my husband is in trouble. I need your advice.\" \"Your husband, mistress, has had all the boon and gift I could make him, and more, in the breath of life that still passes his lips.\" The sulfur eyes regarded her, remote and chill. Not catlike, nor snakelike, nor like any beast\u0027s, but neither were they a man\u0027s eyes. Even his lashes were white, like his hair. \"And a second time will I fill his hands with undeserved treasure, when I let you walk from this house.\" \"The Earl of Ernchester is selling his services to a foreign government.\" Don Simon Ysidro\u0027s expression did not alter. Indeed, his face, still as the peeled ivory statue of some forgotten god, had shown neither anger nor scorn, as if over the years the flesh had settled to a final resting place on the delicate substructure of skull. Nor had his voice risen over the soft level that was almost, but not quite, a monotone, and all the more terrifying for that. Don Simon Xavier Christian Morado de la Cadena-Ysidro was the only vampire Lydia had met. She wondered if others were like him. \"Come upstairs.\" He handed her back her weapon and led the way, lamp upraised to shed light on the damp stone stairs. His feet beneath the hem of his shroudlike woolen robe were bare. Though Lydia \u0027s breath clouded gold in the lamplight, the owner of the nameless house seemed to feel nothing of the cold. Four cats somehow materialized in the scullery, miawing to be fed, though Lydia observed that none came within arm\u0027s reach of the vampire. Ysidro set the lamp on the table and touched a spill to the flame. Though he was extremely difficult to see when he moved, Lydia had impressions, like frozen images from a dream, of white hands cupping light above the curved glass chimney and carrying it to the fishtail burners above the stove; of dense gold outlining the slight hook of the nose, the long chin and trace of shadow at the corner of his mouth. He opened the icebox, addressed the cats in Spanish and put meat and milk down for them. Then he stepped away from their dishes. Only then did they come close to eat. \"Where did you hear this?\" He held a chair while she sat, then perched a flank on the corner of the table. His English was flawless, save for the faintest touch of a Castilian lisp, and the occasional oddly bent inflection that Lydia knew would have conveyed volumes to James. In the set of Ysidro\u0027s shoulders, the way he held his head, she saw the echo of a long-vanished doublet and stiffened ruff. She held out to him the telegram she had received Monday morning from the Gare du Nord. \"Ignace Karolyi is-\" \"I know who Ignace Karolyi is.\" His voice still held no very great interest, as if all emotion had long been worn away by the sheer abrasion of passing time. Indeed, in stillness, Lydia had the odd impression that he had been sitting so on the corner of the table for years, perhaps centuries. The vampire turned the paper in ivory fingers, raised it to his nostrils, then touched it, very gently, first to his cheekbone, then to his lower lip. \"A Hungarian boyar and, like your husband at one time, a man who cherishes the honor of service to his empire above personal honor, though perhaps Hungarians as a rule do not consider truth and loyalty as the English do. A diplomat, and a spy.\" \"I didn\u0027t know then about Karolyi,\" Lydia said. Some of her panic was passing-at least he appeared willing to listen to what she said. \"I mean, only what James says in his wire. But I recognized his name. I found it in one of the lists I made a year ago, when I was trying to track down medical doctors I suspected of contacts with vampires. I was making notes of every name I found in any article. This one was in an article about Dr. Bedford Fairport.\" He tilted his head a little, like an albinistic bird. \"The man who seeks to have men live forever.\" \"You\u0027ve heard of him, then.\" Reading over the long series of articles last night, she hadn\u0027t thought of Fairport\u0027s work on the changes wrought in brain and blood and glandular chemistry over time in exactly that light-she doubted that Fairport himself would see it that way. But suddenly she knew that Ysidro was right. \"This was one of his early articles,\" she went on slowly. \"Back in \u0027eighty-six or \u0027eighty-seven, when he first went to Austria to study those Styrian peasants who live to be a hundred and ten. He mentions that the private sanitarium he was given charge of is owned by the Karolyi family, and that it was Ignace Karolyi who made the arrangements. He mentions Karolyi in the next article as a financial contributor who made research possible. And then Karolyi vanishes. In fact, all reference to Fairport\u0027s funding vanishes. It\u0027s never mentioned again. I checked.\" \"It astounds me that I did not read that myself.\" Ysidro sounded not the slightest astounded. \"But I subscribe to a good many journals, as I daresay you saw.\" Lydia blushed. What had seemed, at the time, to be the necessary investigation of a vampire\u0027s lair became trespass in a gentleman\u0027s house. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she stammered, but he vouchsafed no reply. Instead his finger moved in the direction of the sprayer. \"And what is this?\" \"Oh.\" Lydia took the sticking plaster from her pocket and recapped the nozzle. \"It\u0027s full of silver nitrate solution. One can buy it in any chandlery. I-well, James once mentioned that vampires sometimes slept several to a house. I didn\u0027t know what I might meet, you see.\" She was afraid he would mock her, since, upon consideration, the weapon would certainly have been difficult to deploy quickly enough to do her any good. She had learned to deal with mockery from an early age over her medical studies, but this was a matter from which she could not simply walk away. But the vampire only said, \"Ingenious,\" and touched the side of the pump\u0027s reservoir with the backs of his fingers, then took them quickly away. In the pale gaslight, Lydia could see that his ears had been long ago pierced for earrings, like a Gypsy\u0027s. \"Then this Fairport is in truth Karolyi\u0027s pensioner.\" \"I think so.\" Lydia held out to him another telegram, the telegram which, reaching her that morning from Munich, had caused her to pack her trunks, manufacture a moderately plausible tale for her servants, and take the train down to London in search of the man in whose kitchen she now sat, with the smallest of his cats-a sinuous shadow-gray torn-winding itself around her ankles. Ysidro took the second paper from her hand. LEAVING PARIS STOP STAYING EPPLER ADDRESS BOOK JAMES \"He\u0027s waxed cautious since his first wire.\" The vampire touched the paper to his lower lip again. \"You conned this book of his?\" \"After I decoded the message, yes.\" She reached down half unconsciously to stroke the cat, looking up at Ysidro where he sat above her, hands folded over his knee. His nails projected some half inch beyond the tips of his fingers and had a strange glassy appearance, far thicker than human nails. Some kind of chitin? It would be rude to ask for a cutting. \"The words \u0027address book\u0027 were the tip, you see,\" she explained. \"It\u0027s a simple code; last for first, counting inward, and A means B, B means C, et cetera. He keeps duplicate books. Eppler is two from the end of the E\u0027s-Mrs. Eppler is the mother of an old pupil of his. She lives in Botley, about ten miles from Oxford, and it\u0027s ridiculous that he\u0027d be going there from Paris. Two from the beginning of the F\u0027s was Fairport, in Vienna. As you see, the telegram was sent from Munich, at one-forty Tuesday afternoon.\" \"And I was that easy to find?\" Lydia hesitated, wondering if she should lie. Although her initial fears had subsided, she realized she was still in a great deal of danger. She supposed that if Ysidro didn\u0027t have the ability to make people stop fearing him, he would have starved to death centuries ago. The greater fears still lay ahead of her, a vast uncharted territory of deeds she had no concept how to perform. At last she said, \"I knew about this house a year ago. In theory. I hadn\u0027t sought it out. But I looked up all the possibilities of vampire lairs for James while he was... working for you.\" A small line printed itself briefly near the fanged mouth, and the smallest flare of annoyance moved Ysidro\u0027s nostrils. But he only said, \"Then this Fairport is thought by the Department in Vienna to be their man-they, too, having missed the articles which speak of Karolyi\u0027s contributions to Fairport\u0027s research. No matter of surprise, given the fewness of agents and the troubles in the Balkans in that year, and in France. Afterward, one presumes Fairport would have known not to publish his patron\u0027s name.\" \"What it means,\" Lydia said quietly, \"is that James is walking into a trap.\" Ysidro remained still for some time, the telegram unmoving in his fingers, but Lydia could see thought and memory like swift-shuffled cards in the back of the jeweled yellow eyes. Remembering, she guessed, Fairport\u0027s articles on Hungarian and Romanian centenarians, his preoccupation with extending life, his work in a part of the world that James had described as a hotbed of vampire lore. Then he raised his head and said, \"Await me.\" And without seeing him leave, Lydia found herself alone. She checked her watch, wondering how long \"Await me\" meant. If she herself were in a tremendous hurry, she could wash, dress, curl, frizz and put up her hair, and apply a judiciously minuscule quantity of rice powder, kohl, rouge, and cologne in just under two hours and a half, which her husband, manlike, seemed to consider an unreasonable length of time. At least, Lydia thought, she knew how long it took her to make herself presentable and allowed for it, unlike dandies of her acquaintance who lived in the fond delusion that they could assemble the component parts of their facade in \"only a moment, my dearest Mrs. Asher.\" She remembered the clothing in the dressing room upstairs, by the finest tailors in Saville Row. James had warned her, and now she knew from terrifying experience, how fast vampires could move, but she also knew that males as a species tended to potter, fidgeting endlessly with cravats and shifting coins, notebooks, and theater tickets from pocket to pocket as if fearing they would capsize if not properly trimmed. She wondered if death altered this. Twenty- five minutes, she made a mental wager with herself, and was within three of it when she turned her head to find Ysidro at her side again. In his cinder- gray suit, his flesh white as the linen of his shirt, he seemed more ghostlike than he had in the white robe, as if the clothing were a barrier, a shadow of distance. \"Come.\" The alleys and back streets through which he led her were unlit and stinking, full of furtive movement. She guessed their route was not a direct one, but could not be sure, for as soon as they descended the front steps of his house, he took her spectacles from her. Moreover, she was aware that three or four times in the fifteen minutes of their walk, he touched her mind with the blankness, the empty reverie, that vampires apparently could extend. She had the sensation of waking repeatedly from dreams to find herself each time in a new street or court, blinking at ten shades of blurred darkness all spangled with the colored embers of reflected pub lights, with Yiddish or German or Russian yammering on all sides from the little knots of seedy, bearded men clustered in doorways or around chestnut vendors\u0027 braziers. The men would step aside unconsciously to let Ysidro pass, not looking at him, as if they, too, partook of his dream of invisibility; their clothes smelled of hard work and poor diet and not enough hot water for washing. Every other week Lydia took the train down to London to work in the dissecting rooms of St. Luke\u0027s. Men like these, with their brown, broken teeth and their flea bites and their dirty, callused hands would be delivered by the workhouse vans, smelling of carbolic and formalin, dead of tumors that had burst untreated, of pneumonia, of consumption or the other ills of poverty, so that she and others like her could study the intricate beauty of muscle and nerve beneath the knife. It was the first time in her scholarly life that Lydia had been among them living, and her mind swarmed with questions she wished to ask them about the food and working conditions that had contributed to their pathologies. On the other hand, she felt very glad of Ysidro\u0027s protection. They crossed a plank bridge over water nearly invisible beneath low-lying fog, passed the wry, dark roofline of some very ancient church. In time they traversed a sordid alley behind a pub near the river and descended an areaway thick with garbage and the smell of cats. Though her eyes had grown used to darkness, Lydia saw only the moth flicker of pale hands before she heard the snick of a lock going over. Hinges creaked. Ysidro said \"Come\" again and stepped into absolute dark. A match scratched. Ysidro\u0027s narrow face appeared, outlined in saffron. \"You need not concern yourself over rats.\" He touched the flame to a pair of guttered candles in a double branch. The plaster of the walls was black with mildew, falling away to reveal underlying brick. \"Like cats, they are aware of what we are and know that though it is the human death we need to feed our minds, we can derive sustenance from the blood of any living thing.\" He lifted the branch. Twin lights called twin ghosts of shadow, merging and circling in a strange cotillion as he led her toward the back stair. \"Anthea and Ernchester sleep seldom at the house on Savoy Walk these days. It is best to let memories lie. She scarce ever hunts this early in the night, but it may be that she has gone to her dressmaker.\" Lydia checked her watch again as they passed through a downstairs hall: peeling silk wall covering, doors blackly ajar. \"I suppose this close to Christmas there\u0027d be one open...\" \"If one has money, mistress, one always finds those willing to sell their sleep and their leisure. I have visited my bootmaker at midnight and never found him but that he was consumed with delight.\" \"What do you tell him?\" She couldn\u0027t imagine her aunt Harriet\u0027s modiste keeping open past seven for Queen Alexandra herself. Ysidro regarded her with eyes turned amber by the ruddy light. \"That I will have none of this foolishness of two-colored shoes, nor buttons up the side.\" He turned to the room at the top of the stair. \"So.\" Like Ysidro\u0027s house, the chamber held little furniture, and that furniture old. A tester bed with a curving footboard stood against the rotted wall panels, the counterpane as faded as the silk paper downstairs; on the other wall, a blackwood armoire, stained, chipped, thick with dust-choked carving and mottled with water damage. Its doors stood open. Petticoats, corsets, stockings lay across the bed, and with them-separated by the length of space that would have accounted for a large portmanteau-two dresses Lydia immediately recognized as unsuitable for travel, one because of its now-unfashionable leg-o\u0027-mutton sleeves, the other because it was white, a color no sane woman, dead or Undead, would wear on a train. \"She\u0027s gone after him,\" Lydia said, opening the armoire doors. The only dresses there in the current fashion were the decollete silks and sumptuous velvets of evening wear. No waists, no skirts- Lydia peered shortsightedly into the lower drawer, and Ysidro handed her eyeglasses back-and no walking shoes. \"She packed in a hurry...\" She halted, frowning, as her eyes adjusted to the sudden clarity and she realized that the tops of the dressers were in disorder: scarves, sleeves, kerchiefs caught in drawers that had been hastily closed. \"The place has been searched.\" Ysidro, who had passed swiftly into the other room, returned, moving his head as if scenting the air. \"Living men, days ago, before she packed, I think. The air still whispers of their tobacco and their blood.\" He crossed to the bed, studied the garments lying there. All the colors, as far as Lydia could tell in the low amber radiance of candlelight, that a dark woman would wear; everything of the highest quality- Swiss cotton, Melton wool, Italian silk. They were cut for a woman of Lydia \u0027s height, with a waist like a stem and breasts like blown roses. \"Her clothing.\" Ysidro turned a chemise over in one gray-gloved hand. \"None of his. I like this not, Mistress Asher.\" He let the silk slither away. \"For many years now it has only been love of her that has kept him on this earth. She is the strong one. He hunts in her shadow, brittle, like antique glass.\" \"Might that be reason in itself?\" Lydia turned from the dresser, where an ivory hair receiver and ivory-handled scissors spoke of other pieces of a matched toilet set now vanished: brush, comb, mirror. A glove box lay open, gloves of all colors lying like dried and flaccid spiders where they had been spilled. Ysidro lifted a brow. Lydia went on hesitantly, \"Might he be fleeing her?\" \"To such sanctuary as the Austrian Empire would afford?\" He moved around the corner of the bed, touched the imprint on the dusty counterpane where the portmanteau had rested, and his nostrils flared again, seeking clues from the alien scents of the air. \"I would not have said so. She loves him, guards him; she is all in all to him.\" He paused for a long time, his face half turned from her, inexpressive as the level softness of his voice. \"But it is true that one may hate one\u0027s all in all at the same time that one loves. This was something...\" Another pause, debating; then he went on, \"This was something I never understood as a living man.\" He met her eyes, expressionless, and she could not reply. After a time he said, \"The Calais Mail departs Charing Cross at nine. I doubt we can prepare swiftly enough to make tonight\u0027s. Meet me tomorrow night at eight on the platform, you and your maid. I shall wire my own arrangements to Paris beforehand; I can-\" \"I\u0027m not taking a maid!\" Lydia said, shocked. Ysidro\u0027s brows lifted again, colorless against his colorless face. \"Naturally, she shall know nothing of me, save as a chance-met companion on the train.\" \"No.\" \"Mistress Asher-\" \"This is not a matter for discussion, Don Simon.\" Frightened as she was at the thought of traveling to Vienna -of dealing with one or possibly several vampires- the thought of journeying in company with one unnerved her still more. And as for putting Ellen or anyone else in similar danger... \"I came to you for advice in dealing with vampires, specifically with Lord Ernchester. There isn\u0027t a great deal of reliable information on the subject, you know.\" She saw the flare of genuine exasperation in his eyes behind the vampire stillness, and rather to her own surprise it didn\u0027t frighten her as it had. \"But I would not take anyone-certainly not a woman who\u0027s been my friend and servant for nearly fifteen years-into that situation without telling her what kind of danger she may be facing, which, on the face of it, is impossible.\" \"A woman of your station does not travel alone.\" \"Nonsense. My friend Josetta Beyerly travels by herself all the time. So does-\" \"You will not.\" Ysidro\u0027s voice did not grow louder, nor his expression change, but she felt his irritation like a wave of cold off a block of ice. \"In my day no woman traveled alone, save peasants and women of the streets.\" \"Well, when I encounter a roving band of paid-off mercenary soldiers between here and Calais, I\u0027ll certainly wish I\u0027d taken your advice.\" \"Don\u0027t talk foolishness. You might trace Karolyi but you would never get near Ernchester, and it is Ernchester to whom I must speak on this matter.\" \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s talking foolishness,\" retorted Lydia, though she knew he was right. \"This is the twentieth century, not the sixteenth. I will certainly appreciate whatever advice you can give me...\" \"Advice will gain you little against either Karolyi or Ernchester. If you wish to warn your husband of his danger, you must travel with me-and travel I will, to prevent Charles from doing this thing, whatever his motives.\" Lydia was silent for a moment, unnerved beyond words at the thought of such a journey but remembering how utterly unprepared she had been to encounter him in the crypt. \"If you must,\" she said slowly, her dream of fanged white faces returning to her. \"Thank you... but I am not taking my maid into the situation she\u0027d face if we meet Ernchester, and I\u0027m not exposing her to the chance of finding out inconvenient things about you. Which she\u0027d do,\" added Lydia. \"Ellen\u0027s got an inquisitive streak, and she\u0027s smarter than she appears. I won\u0027t do that to her.\" \"Hire one for the journey, then.\" \"So that you can kill her when the journey is done? And kill me, too, for that matter?\" she added, her mind making a tardy leap to the ultimate danger of traveling with the dead. She knew too much already-even her admission of knowing where his lairs lay had violated the lines so carefully drawn when James and Ysidro had parted a year ago in the burning house on Harley Street. He needs a human companion, she thought, in his search for Ernchester, someone who could deal with such problems as might overtake him when daylight was near; and he needs someone who knows James well enough to track him, to guess his movements, and through him, Karolyi and Ernchester. She\u0027d told Ellen and Mrs. Grimes she was visiting her cousins in Maida Vale. It would be weeks before she was even missed. She kept her eyes on his, positive she resembled nothing so much as a myopic rabbit attempting to stare down a dragon. Slowly, the vampire said, \"You need have no fear of me, mistress. Nor will your woman, so long as she keeps from asking about that which does not concern her.\" \"No.\" James had told her of the vampire ability to touch living minds, a cold grip, the dreadful sensation of steely will. But his power extended to blanking and smothering thought, to diverting attention... not to changing resolve. It was a predator\u0027s power, a spy\u0027s and a fugitive\u0027s, not that of one who must negotiate with humankind. She saw that realization dawn in his eyes, and his mouth tightened with annoyance. \"If we are to be companions in this enterprise, I will not have you traveling alone abroad like a jauntering slut,\" he said. \"I think your husband would agree with me in that.\" \"What my husband thinks is my husband\u0027s business, and neither yours nor mine,\" said Lydia. \"And I would rather be taken for a jauntering slut than betray a woman who\u0027s dependent on me. And if it doesn\u0027t suit you, I\u0027ll travel by myself.\" Ysidro bent and kissed her hand, his lips like silk left outside on a dry night of hard frost. \"Bon voyage, then, mistress. And bonne chance in your dealings with the Undead.\" With a sensation like waking up, Lydia found herself alone. It was not, in fact, terribly late to be abandoned in a completely unfamiliar part of London. Though the fog had thickened and the night was growing colder, the streets were still populous, albeit with foreign laborers from the sweatshops that abounded in the neighborhood and with sailors who seemed to accept Ysidro\u0027s outdated presumption that a woman on her own was a jauntering slut, at least as far as Lydia could understand their idiomatic references to Master John Thursday and pintle jigs. Evidently, Josetta\u0027s suffragist doctrines had yet to penetrate this far. Lydia made a mental note to let her know. As she had guessed, she wasn\u0027t far from the river, and on the broad, electric lit thoroughfare of the Embankment, she had no trouble in finding a cab to take her back to the small hotel near the museum where she had left her luggage. Taken in the balance, she thought-removing her gloves and unpinning cook\u0027s nondescript hat-she was more glad than sorry that Ysidro would not be accompanying her to Vienna. People did travel alone, of course, and there was no reason why she shouldn\u0027t, Ysidro\u0027s antiquated notions notwithstanding: The world abounded with policemen to be appealed to, porters to be tipped, cabs, guides, travel bureaus, quality hotels with obliging managers, and shops in which to purchase anything she might forget to pack. The lack of a maid would engender certain difficulties, of course, but that was what hotel chambermaids were for. It was unlikely she would catch up with James before he reached Vienna, but with luck, his cautious nature might keep him out of immediate peril until she could arrive and apprise him of the fact that he was dealing with a double agent-if worse came to worst, she could inform whoever was in charge of the Vienna Department that Dr. Fairport\u0027s sanitarium in the Vienna Woods was the likeliest place to search for a clue to James\u0027 whereabouts. If whoever was in charge wasn\u0027t taking money from the Austrians as well. From what James had told her, that was at least a possibility, and Lydia wondered how on earth she\u0027d be able to tell. Forcing down her sense of panic again, she reviewed such of her luggage as she had unpacked for the night: peignoir, two pairs of slippers-the prettier but far less comfortable ones in case any of the hotel staff came in-rose water and glycerine for her hands, distilled water of green pineapples to alleviate the incipient wrinkles Aunt Harriet had always assured her excessive reading would bring on, silver-backed hairbrush, comb, toothbrush, nail file, curling irons, frizzing irons, hairpins, several sets of underwear, corsetry, petticoats, an array of silver table knives whetted to as deadly an edge as silver would take, and a.38 caliber revolver containing the silver bullets she had had made last year. Lydia had felt like the heroine of a penny dreadful, packing that along with the talcum, rice powder, rouge, lotions, and perfumes. There was also the market basket that she\u0027d bought in Covent Garden that afternoon, containing thick braids of garlic bulbs, packets of aconite and whitethorn, branches of wild rose. She wreathed her pillow with them and hung them in the single window of the unheated little back bedroom, and as she undressed and unlaced herself-there were disadvantages to staying in hotels where she was unlikely to meet anyone she or her family knew- she turned over in her mind her other options. Confide in one of her friends and take her as a companion? Josetta understood politics and feared nothing but, Lydia knew from experience, wasn\u0027t particularly practical: she always seemed outraged at being arrested for suffragist activities which, though certainly necessary for the overall strategy of that movement, flagrantly violated the law. Her other close friend, Anne Gresholm, wiser and more intelligent, had lectures and students of her own to tend to, and her health was not good. In any case, the danger remained the same. Lydia was also aware that she had a certain amount of sufferance from Ysidro as long as she told no one of the existence of vampires. If she violated that secret, or if Josetta or Anne guessed-which they surely would-she could not answer for their safety or her own on their return. Go to Ysidro, then, and ask him to accompany her after all? It would only resurrect the issue of a maid. She wouldn\u0027t endanger Ellen, and a chance-hired stranger would be in the same peril and might be more inquisitive and less reliable to boot. Lydia sighed, slipped the revolver under her single, paltry pillow, and at length drifted into sleep among blankets strewed with wolfsbane, railway timetables, and guidebooks to the eastern reaches of the Austrian lands. It must be the smell of the garlic, she thought, aware that she was dreaming and that the dream was far more vivid-lurid, even- than anything she had dreamed at home. The garlic, or that house in the fog... She stood on the terrace of a tall mansion, a glory of half-timbering and ornamental stone, with a moon-drenched garden maze on one hand and lighted windows of many-paned glass on the other. Looking in, she saw courtiers in the stiff velvets, the soft-glowing pearls of Elizabeth \u0027s reign. They were dancing, and she could hear the swift and complex run of the music: hands linking, farthingales flouncing, the men all wearing little Shakespearean chin beards and looking silly beyond description in tights and trunk hose and bulging peasecod doublets, the women in skirts hooped out like kitchen tables and in collars of upstanding, wired lace. A woman stood near the windows, whom Lydia noticed because she was wearing modern garments, a plain brown serge that didn\u0027t fit her particularly well and certainly didn\u0027t become her. She was plain-faced, with a slightly receding chin, of medium height, and rather pear-shaped without being fat; a wealth of curly black hair lay loose upon her narrow shoulders. Sometimes when Lydia \u0027s eyes left her and returned, she\u0027d be wearing Elizabethan clothing, dull-colored and worked high to the neck. A servant\u0027s gown, or a poor relation\u0027s. Her small hands fussed with the jet buttons of her sleeves. Then, very softly, Ysidro spoke. \"You would think, the way they danced, they\u0027d wear something more suited to the exercise, would you not?\" His voice was so quiet Lydia wondered that she could hear it through the glass and over the music. She saw him then, standing at the brown woman\u0027s side. His black velvet doublet, his knee-length breeches, his high, supple boots, harked just enough to a later period to avoid the inherent ridiculousness of male Elizabethan garb without appearing anachronistic, and his hueless hair seemed warmer in the torchlight, darkened almost to honey. The girl replied, maudibly, but it made Ysidro laugh, as if he were playing the part of someone else. Can\u0027t she see it? wondered Lydia, terrified. Can\u0027t she see what he is? For a time they stood shoulder to shoulder watching the dancers in their fairy-tale costumes, the vampire and the girl. Lydia \u0027s dreams changed, fleeted. She saw them again, this time in another garden, wide parterres of topiary and tapis verte, when he taught the dark-haired girl to waltz in the moonlight under the blank eyes of marble gods. Saw them later kiss beneath the gargoyles of an archway, among crowded houses built on a bridge, torchlight and lamplight from the windows above them red as jewels in Ysidro\u0027s eyes. Through another window-two windows, for Lydia herself was in a dark room across an alley that plunged sixty feet down into a canyon of night-she saw Ysidro lying wounded on the girl\u0027s sparse bed, the girl bending over him in some kind of old-fashioned garb, knotting dressings over a sword cut in his chest that would have killed a living man. Ysidro moved his hand a little, and the girl bent down to press her lips to his. \"You are different from all these others,\" she heard him say, in the curtained embrasure of a palace window, the sound of violins like fragile perfume amid the talk and laughter of dancers. Palace of Versailles, Lydia guessed vaguely from the cut of Ysidro\u0027s plum-colored silk coat. \"How sick I have grown of them, through all eternity. I had not thought to find a woman like you.\" He raised the girl\u0027s hand to his lips. \"We have known one another, loved one another, down through endless time.\" He wrapped the girl in the dense velvet weight of his cloak as they stood alone in winter-locked woodlands, moonlight shiny on a meringue of snow beyond the barred shadows of the copse in which they stood. The girl\u0027s hair was disheveled, her gown torn, and Lydia knew that Ysidro had rescued her from some peril, and that the bodies of dead men lay out of sight in the gully by a winter-silent stream. Lydia \u0027s own feet were cold in shoes wet with slush as she stood behind a tree with the wet weight of her skirt sticking to her ankles. \"Do you not remember?\" The girl in brown-it was the same brown dress as before, with the puffed sleeves and wide collar ten years behind current mode-whispered, \"I remember, Simon. I remember... everything,\" and their mouths met in the zebra moonlight. No! cried Lydia, and though her breath swirled in a diamond cloud, she could produce no sound. He\u0027s lying to you! He\u0027s going to kill you! Horrified, she fought to run toward them, but black thorns caught her skirts, held her back. She tried to pull free, and the branches cracked beneath her fingers like dried insects. She woke to find herself clutching the bony fragments of hawthorn twig that lay on her pillow. Lydia took the two o\u0027clock tram for Paris. Even after that strange farrago of romantic interludes by moonlight faded from her dreams, she kept waking with the icy sense that a slender shadow with yellow eyes waited just outside her door. By the time she was awake, bathed, laced, dressed, packed, powdered, perfumed, made-up, and had fixed her hair-no small accomplishment without a maid-and considered herself fit to be viewed by the public, she had missed both the morning trains. Never again, she thought, will I stay at an inconspicuous hotel just to avoid questions from my family. She reached Paris shortly after nine that night, missing the train to Vienna by an hour and a half-it left from another station in any case-and registered, travel-weary and aching, at the Hotel St. Petersbourg that Thomas Cook and Sons had obligingly contacted on her behalf the day before. Paris, at least, she knew from her days of debutante shopping and educational sightseeing, and later from medical conferences. Her French was good, and she understood how to handle herself in this milieu. Perhaps, she reflected, the journey would be easier than she feared, as long as she took everything methodically, one step at a time, like a complicated dissection or a series of analyses of unknown secretions. Again she slept badly, her dreams filled with the dark-haired girl in brown and Don Simon Ysidro rescuing each other from the cardinal\u0027s guards and trading kisses on the sands of moon-soaked Moroccan deserts. Waking in the darkness, comforter drawn up to her chin, she stared at the slits of reflected streetlamp outlining the shutters and listened to the voices of the cafe down in the street below, wondering where James was and if he was all right. Milk wagons were creaking in the streets when she finally slept. The Vienna Express didn\u0027t leave until seven-thirty that evening, so there was plenty of time, not only to pack and dress properly and have the hotel maid fix her hair, but to do a little shopping at the Magasins du Printemps, which lay just down the street. She was buttering a croissant in the almost empty dining room and speculating about the pathology of Don Simon Ysidro\u0027s fingernails-clearly there had been an organic change of some kind, so the physical side of the vampire syndrome did not involve complete cellular stasis-when she heard the solitary waiter murmur, \"B\u0027njour, m\u0027mselle,\" and glanced up to see another woman enter the room. Even at this distance and without her spectacles, Lydia deduced this woman to be harmless: tallish and slightly stooped, she moved with the uncertainty of one who feels herself to be half a foreigner even in her own country, let alone in a land where she doesn\u0027t speak the language. The next second she frowned, wondering why she thought she recognized her. There was something familiar about her, and as the woman drew near and came a little more into focus, Lydia realized what it was. She was wearing a brown dress with the puffed sleeves and wide collar fashionable in the nineties. Lydia set down her coffee cup. \"Mrs. Asher?\" The woman stopped beside her table, fidgeting her hands in mended gloves, a look of anxiety in her blue eyes. She was about twenty-three, much more awkward than she\u0027d been in the dreams, and, like Lydia when Lydia knew nobody would see her, wore eyeglasses. \"Don Simon told me I\u0027d find you here.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/traveling-with-the-dead-james-asher-2/page-4.html","bookId":2490,"book":{"id":2490,"title":"Traveling with the Dead (James Asher #2)","description":"Storyline: Traveling with the Dead (James Asher #2) Down through the deathless centuries, the vampires had drunk human blood for sustenance and for sport. They preyed where they willed, for no mortal humans could resist their unclean powers. But now came the ultimate perversion, the unthinkable: someone was conscripting the vampires into the secret services of a foreign power. No government agency or bureaucrat could control the Undead. The idea was absurd, as Dr. James Asher knew all too well. Years in His Majesty\u0027s service had taught Asher the finer points of espionage. And he knew the secrets of the vampires--a familiarity hard-won in unwilling service to Don Simon Ysidro, oldest and most subtle of the hunters of the London night. What Asher didn\u0027t know was why one of England\u0027s established vampires would risk everything to travel across the European continent at the behest of a ruthless spymaster. But he could see the terrifying potential of such an unholy alliance...","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/traveling-with-the-dead-james-asher-2.jpg","author":"Barbara Hambly","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/traveling-with-the-dead-james-asher-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:42:25 PM"}}
