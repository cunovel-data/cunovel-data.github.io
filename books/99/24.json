{"id":2499,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"24:1 [hgb] 过 了 五 天 ， 大 祭 司 亚 拿 尼 亚 ， 同 几 个 长 老 ， 和 一 个 辩 士 帖 土 罗 ， 下 来 ， 向 巡 抚 控 告 保 罗 。 \n [kjv] And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul. \n [bbe] And after five days, the high priest, Ananias, came with certain of the rulers, and an expert talker, one Tertullus; and they made a statement to Felix against Paul. \n 24:2 [hgb] 保 罗 被 提 了 来 ， 帖 土 罗 就 告 他 说 ， \n [kjv] And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, \n [bbe] And when he had been sent for, Tertullus, starting his statement, said, Because by you we are living in peace, and through your wisdom wrongs are put right for this nation, \n 24:3 [hgb] 腓 力 斯 大 人 ， 我 们 因 你 得 以 大 享 太 平 ， 并 且 这 一 国 的 弊 病 ， 因 着 你 的 先 见 ， 得 以 更 正 了 。 我 们 随 时 随 地 ， 满 心 感 谢 不 尽 。 \n [kjv] We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. \n [bbe] In all things and in all places we are conscious of our great debt to you, most noble Felix. \n 24:4 [hgb] 惟 恐 多 说 ， 你 嫌 烦 絮 ， 只 求 你 宽 容 听 我 们 说 几 句 话 。 \n [kjv] Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. \n [bbe] But, so that I may not make you tired, I make a request to you of your mercy, to give hearing to a short statement. \n 24:5 [hgb] 我 们 看 这 个 人 ， 如 同 瘟 疫 一 般 ， 是 鼓 动 普 天 下 众 犹 太 人 生 乱 的 ， 又 是 拿 撒 勒 教 党 里 的 一 个 头 目 。 \n [kjv] For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: \n [bbe] For this man, in our opinion, is a cause of trouble, a maker of attacks on the government among Jews through all the empire, and a chief mover in the society of the Nazarenes: \n 24:6 [hgb] 连 圣 殿 他 也 想 要 污 秽 。 我 们 把 他 捉 住 了 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 要 按 我 们 的 律 法 审 问 。 \n [kjv] Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. \n [bbe] Who, in addition, was attempting to make the Temple unclean: whom we took, \n 24:7 [hgb] 不 料 千 夫 长 吕 西 亚 前 来 甚 是 强 横 从 我 们 手 中 把 他 夺 去 ， 吩 咐 告 他 的 人 到 你 这 里 来 ） 。 \n [kjv] But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, \n [bbe] [] \n 24:8 [hgb] 你 自 己 究 问 他 ， 就 可 以 知 道 我 们 告 他 的 一 切 事 了 。 \n [kjv] Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. \n [bbe] And from whom you will be able, by questioning him yourself, to get knowledge of all the things which we say against him. \n 24:9 [hgb] 众 犹 太 人 也 随 着 告 他 说 ， 事 情 诚 然 是 这 样 。 \n [kjv] And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. \n [bbe] And the Jews were in agreement with his statement, saying that these things were so. \n 24:10 [hgb] 巡 抚 点 头 叫 保 罗 说 话 ， 他 就 说 ， 我 知 道 你 在 这 国 里 断 事 多 年 ， 所 以 我 乐 意 为 自 己 分 诉 。 \n [kjv] Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: \n [bbe] Then when the ruler had given him a sign to make his answer, Paul said, Because I have knowledge that you have been a judge over this nation for a number of years, I am glad to make my answer: \n 24:11 [hgb] 你 查 问 就 可 以 知 道 ， 从 我 上 耶 路 撒 冷 礼 拜 ， 到 今 日 ， 不 过 有 十 二 天 。 \n [kjv] Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. \n [bbe] Seeing that you are able to make certain of the fact that it is not more than twelve days from the time when I came up to Jerusalem for worship; \n 24:12 [hgb] 他 们 并 没 有 看 见 我 在 殿 里 ， 或 是 在 会 堂 里 ， 或 是 在 城 里 ， 和 人 辩 论 ， 耸 动 众 人 。 \n [kjv] And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: \n [bbe] And they have not seen me in argument with any man in the Temple, or working up the feelings of the people, in the Synagogues or in the town: \n 24:13 [hgb] 他 们 现 在 所 告 我 的 事 ， 并 不 能 对 你 证 实 了 。 \n [kjv] Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. \n [bbe] And they are not able to give facts in support of the things which they say against me now. \n 24:14 [hgb] 但 有 一 件 事 ， 我 向 你 承 认 ， 就 是 他 们 所 称 为 异 端 的 道 ， 我 正 按 着 那 道 事 奉 我 祖 宗 的 神 ， 又 信 合 乎 律 法 的 ， 和 先 知 书 上 一 切 所 记 载 的 。 \n [kjv] But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: \n [bbe] But this I will say openly to you, that I do give worship to the God of our fathers after that Way, which to them is not the true religion: but I have belief in all the things which are in the law and in the books of the prophets: \n 24:15 [hgb] 并 且 靠 着 神 ， 盼 望 死 人 ， 无 论 善 恶 ， 都 要 复 活 ， 就 是 他 们 自 己 也 有 这 个 盼 望 。 \n [kjv] And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. \n [bbe] Hoping in God for that which they themselves are looking for, that there will be a coming back from the dead for upright men and wrongdoers. \n 24:16 [hgb] 我 因 此 自 己 勉 励 ， 对 神 ， 对 人 ， 常 存 无 亏 的 良 心 。 \n [kjv] And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men. \n [bbe] And in this, I do my best at all times to have no reason for shame before God or men. \n 24:17 [hgb] 过 了 几 年 ， 我 带 着 周 济 本 国 的 捐 项 和 供 献 的 物 上 去 。 \n [kjv] Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. \n [bbe] Now after a number of years I came to give help and offerings to my nation: \n 24:18 [hgb] 正 献 的 时 候 ， 他 们 看 见 我 在 殿 里 已 经 洁 净 了 ， 并 没 有 聚 众 ， 也 没 有 吵 嚷 。 惟 有 几 个 从 亚 西 亚 来 的 犹 太 人 。 \n [kjv] Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. \n [bbe] And having been made clean, I was in the Temple, but not with a great number of people, and not with noise: but there were certain Jews from Asia, \n 24:19 [hgb] 他 们 若 有 告 我 的 事 ， 就 应 当 到 你 面 前 来 告 我 。 \n [kjv] Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. \n [bbe] And it would have been better if they had come here to make a statement, if they have anything against me. \n 24:20 [hgb] 即 或 不 然 ， 这 些 人 ， 若 看 出 我 站 在 公 会 前 ， 有 妄 为 的 地 方 ， 他 们 自 己 也 可 以 说 明 。 \n [kjv] Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council, \n [bbe] Or let these men here present say what wrongdoing was seen in me when I was before the Sanhedrin, \n 24:21 [hgb] 纵 然 有 ， 也 不 过 一 句 话 ， 就 是 我 站 在 他 们 中 间 大 声 说 ， 我 今 日 在 你 们 面 前 受 审 ， 是 为 死 人 复 活 的 道 理 \n [kjv] Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day. \n [bbe] But only this one thing which I said among them in a loud voice, I am this day being judged on the question of the coming back from the dead. \n 24:22 [hgb] 腓 力 斯 本 是 详 细 晓 得 这 道 ， 就 支 吾 他 们 说 ， 且 等 千 夫 长 吕 西 亚 下 来 ， 我 要 审 断 你 们 的 事 。 \n [kjv] And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. \n [bbe] But Felix, who had a more detailed knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, When Lysias, the chief captain, comes down, I will give attention to your business. \n 24:23 [hgb] 于 是 吩 咐 百 夫 长 看 守 保 罗 并 且 宽 待 他 ， 也 不 拦 阻 他 的 亲 友 来 供 给 他 。 \n [kjv] And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him. \n [bbe] And he gave orders to the captain to keep Paul under his control, and to let him have everything he had need of; and not to keep his friends from coming to see him. \n 24:24 [hgb] 过 了 几 天 ， 腓 力 斯 和 他 夫 人 犹 太 的 女 子 土 西 拉 ， 一 同 来 到 ， 就 叫 了 保 罗 来 ， 听 他 讲 论 信 基 督 耶 稣 的 道 。 \n [kjv] And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. \n [bbe] But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was of the Jews by birth, and sent for Paul, and gave hearing to him about faith in Christ Jesus. \n 24:25 [hgb] 保 罗 讲 论 公 义 ， 节 制 ， 和 将 来 的 审 判 ， 腓 力 斯 甚 觉 恐 惧 ， 说 ， 你 暂 且 去 吧 ， 等 我 得 便 再 叫 你 来 。 \n [kjv] And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. \n [bbe] And while he was talking about righteousness and self-control and the judging which was to come, Felix had great fear and said, Go away for the present, and when the right time comes I will send for you. \n 24:26 [hgb] 腓 力 斯 又 指 望 保 罗 送 他 银 钱 ， 所 以 屡 次 叫 他 来 ， 和 他 谈 论 。 \n [kjv] He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. \n [bbe] For he was hoping that Paul would give him money: so he sent for him more frequently and had talk with him. \n 24:27 [hgb] 过 了 两 年 ， 波 求 非 斯 都 接 了 腓 力 斯 的 任 ， 腓 力 斯 要 讨 犹 太 人 的 喜 欢 ， 就 留 保 罗 在 监 里 。 \n [kjv] But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix\u0027 room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. \n [bbe] But after two years Porcius Festus took the place of Felix, who, desiring to have the approval of the Jews, kept Paul in chains. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2218.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
