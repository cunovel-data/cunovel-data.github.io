for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. \n [bbe] Then Paul said, What are you doing, weeping and wounding my heart? for I am ready, not only to be a prisoner, but to be put to death at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. \n 21:14 [hgb] 保 罗 既 不 听 劝 ， 我 们 便 住 了 口 ， 只 说 ， 愿 主 的 旨 意 成 就 便 了 。 \n [kjv] And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. \n [bbe] And as he might not be moved we did no more, saying, Let the purpose of God be done. \n 21:15 [hgb] 过 了 几 日 ， 我 们 收 拾 行 李 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 。 \n [kjv] And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem. \n [bbe] And after these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem. \n 21:16 [hgb] 有 该 撒 利 亚 的 几 个 门 徒 和 我 们 同 去 ， 带 我 们 到 一 个 久 为 （ 久 为 或 作 老 ） 门 徒 的 家 里 ， 叫 我 们 与 他 同 住 ， 他 名 叫 拿 孙 ， 是 居 比 路 人 。 \n [kjv] There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge. \n [bbe] And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, taking a certain Mnason of Cyprus, one of the early disciples, in whose house we were to be living. \n 21:17 [hgb] 到 了 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 弟 兄 们 欢 欢 喜 喜 地 接 待 我 们 。 \n [kjv] And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. \n [bbe] And when we came to Jerusalem, the brothers were pleased to see us. \n 21:18 [hgb] 第 二 天 ， 保 罗 同 我 们 去 见 雅 各 。 长 老 们 也 都 在 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present. \n [bbe] And on the day after, Paul went with us to James, and all the rulers of the church were present. \n 21:19 [hgb] 保 罗 问 了 他 们 安 ， 便 将 神 用 他 传 教 ， 在 外 邦 人 中 间 所 行 之 事 ， 一 一 地 述 说 了 。 \n [kjv] And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. \n [bbe] And when he had said how glad he was to see them, he gave them a detailed account of the things which God had done through his work among the Gentiles. \n 21:20 [hgb] 他 们 听 见 ， 就 归 荣 耀 与 神 ， 对 保 罗 说 ， 兄 台 ， 你 看 犹 太 人 中 信 主 的 有 多 少 万 ， 并 且 都 为 律 法 热 心 。 \n [kjv] And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: \n [bbe] And hearing it, they gave praise to God; and they said to him, You see, brother, what thousands there are among the Jews, who have the faith; and they all have a great respect for the law: \n 21:21 [hgb] 他 们 听 见 人 说 ， 你 教 训 一 切 在 外 邦 的 犹 太 人 ， 离 弃 摩 西 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 不 要 给 孩 子 行 割 礼 ， 也 不 要 遵 行 条 规 。 \n [kjv] And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. \n [bbe] And they have had news of you, how you have been teaching all the Jews among the Gentiles to give up the law of Moses, and not to give circumcision to their children, and not to keep the old rules. \n 21:22 [hgb] 众 人 必 听 见 你 来 了 ， 这 可 怎 么 办 呢 ？ \n [kjv] What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. \n [bbe] What then is the position? They will certainly get news that you have come. \n 21:23 [hgb] 你 就 照 着 我 们 的 话 行 吧 ， 我 们 这 里 有 四 个 人 ， 都 有 愿 在 身 。 \n [kjv] Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; \n [bbe] Do this, then, which we say to you: We have four men who have taken an oath; \n 21:24 [hgb] 你 带 他 们 去 ， 与 他 们 一 同 行 洁 净 的 礼 ， 替 他 们 拿 出 规 费 ， 叫 他 们 得 以 剃 头 。 这 样 ， 众 人 就 可 知 道 ， 先 前 所 听 见 你 的 事 都 是 虚 的 。 并 可 知 道 ， 你 自 己 为 人 ， 循 规 蹈 矩 ， 遵 行 律 法 。 \n [kjv] Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. \n [bbe] Go with these, and make yourself clean with them, and make the necessary payments for them, so that they may be free from their oath: and everyone will see that the statements made about you are not true, but that you put yourself under rule, and keep the law. \n 21:25 [hgb] 至 于 信 主 的 外 邦 人 ， 我 们 已 经 写 信 拟 定 ， 叫 他 们 谨 忌 那 祭 偶 像 之 物 ， 和 血 ， 并 勒 死 的 牲 畜 ， 与 奸 淫 。 \n [kjv] As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication. \n [bbe] But as to the Gentiles who have the faith, we sent a letter, giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods, and from blood, and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law, and from the evil desires of the body. \n 21:26 [hgb] 于 是 保 罗 带 着 那 四 个 人 ， 第 二 天 与 他 们 一 同 行 了 洁 净 的 礼 ， 进 了 殿 ， 报 明 洁 净 的 日 期 满 足 。 只 等 祭 司 为 他 们 各 人 献 祭 。 \n [kjv] Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them. \n [bbe] Then Paul took the men, and on the day after, making himself clean with them, he went into the Temple, giving out the statement that the days necessary for making them clean were complete, till the offering was made for every one of them. \n 21:27 [hgb] 那 七 日 将 完 ， 从 亚 西 亚 来 的 犹 太 人 ， 看 见 保 罗 在 殿 里 ， 就 耸 动 了 众 人 ， 下 手 拿 他 ， \n [kjv] And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, \n [bbe] And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the Temple, got the people together and put their hands on him, \n 21:28 [hgb] 喊 叫 说 ， 以 色 列 人 来 帮 助 ， 这 就 是 在 各 处 教 训 众 人 糟 践 我 们 百 姓 ， 和 律 法 ， 并 这 地 方 的 。 他 又 带 着 希 利 尼 人 进 殿 ， 污 秽 了 这 圣 地 。 \n [kjv] Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place. \n [bbe] Crying out, Men of Israel, come to our help: this is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place: and in addition, he has taken Greeks into the Temple, and made this holy place unclean. \n 21:29 [hgb] 这 话 是 因 他 们 曾 看 见 以 弗 所 人 特 罗 非 摩 ， 同 保 罗 在 城 里 ， 以 为 保 罗 带 他 进 了 殿 。 \n [kjv] (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.) \n [bbe] For they had seen him before in the town with Trophimus of Ephesus, and had the idea that Paul had taken him with him into the Temple. \n 21:30 [hgb] 合 城 都 震 动 ， 百 姓 一 齐 跑 来 ， 拿 住 保 罗 ， 拉 他 出 殿 ， 殿 门 立 刻 都 关 了 。 \n [kjv] And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut. \n [bbe] And all the town was moved, and the people came running together and put their hands on Paul, pulling him out of the Temple: and then the doors were shut. \n 21:31 [hgb] 他 们 正 想 要 杀 他 ， 有 人 报 信 给 营 里 的 千 夫 长 说 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 合 城 都 乱 了 。 \n [kjv] And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. \n [bbe] And while they were attempting to put him to death, news came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem was out of control. \n 21:32 [hgb] 千 夫 长 立 时 带 着 兵 丁 ， 和 几 个 百 夫 长 ， 跑 下 去 到 他 们 那 里 。 他 们 见 了 千 夫 长 和 兵 丁 ， 就 止 住 不 打 保 罗 。 \n [kjv] Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. \n [bbe] And straight away he took some armed men and went quickly down to them: and the Jews, seeing them, gave no more blows to Paul. \n 21:33 [hgb] 于 是 千 夫 长 上 前 拿 住 他 ， 吩 咐 用 两 条 铁 链 捆 锁 。 又 问 他 是 什 么 人 ， 作 的 是 什 么 事 。 \n [kjv] Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. \n [bbe] Then the chief captain came near and took him, and gave orders for him to be put in chains, questioning them as to who he was and what he had done. \n 21:34 [hgb] 众 人 有 喊 叫 这 个 的 ， 有 喊 叫 那 个 的 。 千 夫 长 因 为 这 样 乱 嚷 ， 得 不 着 实 情 ， 就 吩 咐 人 将 保 罗 带 进 营 楼 去 。 \n [kjv] And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle. \n [bbe] And some said one thing and some another, among the people: and as he was not able to get a knowledge of the facts because of the noise, he gave orders for Paul to be taken into the army building. \n 21:35 [hgb] 到 了 台 阶 上 ， 众 人 挤 得 凶 猛 ， 兵 丁 只 得 将 保 罗 抬 起 来 。 \n [kjv] And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. \n [bbe] And when he came on to the steps, he was lifted up by the armed men, because of the force of the people; \n 21:36 [hgb] 众 人 跟 在 后 面 ， 喊 着 说 ， 除 掉 他 。 \n [kjv] For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him. \n [bbe] For a great mass of people came after them, crying out, Away with him! \n 21:37 [hgb] 将 要 带 他 进 营 楼 ， 保 罗 对 千 夫 长 说 ， 我 对 你 说 句 话 ， 可 以 不 可 以 ？ 他 说 ， 你 懂 得 希 利 尼 话 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? \n [bbe] And when Paul was about to be taken into the building, he said to the chief captain, May I say something to you? And he said, Have you a knowledge of Greek? \n 21:38 [hgb] 你 莫 非 是 从 前 作 乱 ， 带 领 四 千 凶 徒 ， 往 旷 野 去 的 那 埃 及 人 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers? \n [bbe] Are you by chance the Egyptian who, before this, got the people worked up against the government and took four thousand men of the Assassins out into the waste land? \n 21:39 [hgb] 保 罗 说 ， 我 本 是 犹 太 人 ， 生 在 基 利 家 的 大 数 ， 并 不 是 无 名 小 城 的 人 ， 求 你 准 我 对 百 姓 说 话 。 \n [kjv] But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people. \n [bbe] But Paul said, I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, which is not an unimportant town: I make a request to you to let me say a word to the people. \n 21:40 [hgb] 千 夫 长 准 了 ， 保 罗 就 站 在 台 阶 上 ， 向 百 姓 摆 手 ， 他 们 都 静 默 无 声 ， 保 罗 便 用 希 伯 来 话 对 他 们 说 。 \n [kjv] And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, \n [bbe] And when he let him do so, Paul, from the steps, made a sign with his hand to the people, and when they were all quiet, he said to them in the Hebrew language, \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2215.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
