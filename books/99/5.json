And she said, Yea, for so much. \n [bbe] And Peter said to her, Give me an answer: was this amount of money the price of the land? And she said, Yes, it was. \n 5:9 [hgb] 彼 得 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 同 心 试 探 主 的 灵 呢 ？ 埋 葬 你 丈 夫 之 人 的 脚 ， 已 到 门 口 ， 他 们 也 要 把 你 抬 出 去 。 \n [kjv] Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. \n [bbe] But Peter said to her, Why have you made an agreement together to be false to the Spirit of the Lord? See, the feet of the young men who have put the body of your husband in the earth, are at the door, and they will take you out. \n 5:10 [hgb] 妇 人 立 刻 仆 倒 在 彼 得 脚 前 ， 断 了 气 。 那 些 少 年 人 进 来 ， 见 她 已 经 死 了 ， 就 抬 出 去 ， 埋 在 她 丈 夫 旁 边 。 \n [kjv] Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. \n [bbe] And straight away she went down at his feet, and her life went from her: and the young men came in and saw her dead, and they took her out and put her in the earth with her husband. \n 5:11 [hgb] 全 教 会 ， 和 听 见 这 事 的 人 ， 都 甚 惧 怕 。 \n [kjv] And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things. \n [bbe] Then great fear came on all the church and on all who had knowledge of these things. \n 5:12 [hgb] 主 借 使 徒 的 手 ， 在 民 间 行 了 许 多 神 迹 奇 事 ， （ 他 们 （ 或 作 信 的 人 ） 都 同 心 合 意 地 在 所 罗 门 的 廊 下 。 \n [kjv] And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon\u0027s porch. \n [bbe] Now a number of signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the Apostles; and they were all together in Solomon\u0027s covered way. \n 5:13 [hgb] 其 余 的 人 ， 没 有 一 个 敢 贴 近 他 们 。 百 姓 却 尊 重 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them. \n [bbe] The others, in fear, kept back from joining them: but the people made much of them; \n 5:14 [hgb] 信 而 归 主 的 人 越 发 增 添 ， 连 男 带 女 很 多 ） 。 \n [kjv] And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.) \n [bbe] And a great number of men and women had faith, and were joined to the Lord; \n 5:15 [hgb] 甚 至 有 人 将 病 人 抬 到 街 上 ， 放 在 床 上 ， 或 褥 子 上 ， 指 望 彼 得 过 来 的 时 候 ， 或 者 得 他 的 影 儿 照 在 什 么 人 身 上 。 \n [kjv] Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. \n [bbe] And they even took into the streets people who were ill, and put them on beds, so that when Peter went by, some of them might be in his shade. \n 5:16 [hgb] 还 有 许 多 人 ， 带 着 病 人 ， 和 被 污 鬼 缠 磨 的 ， 从 耶 路 撒 冷 四 围 的 城 邑 来 ， 全 都 得 了 医 治 。 \n [kjv] There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one. \n [bbe] And numbers of people came together from the towns round about Jerusalem, with those who were ill and those who were troubled with unclean spirits: and they were all made well. \n 5:17 [hgb] 大 祭 司 和 他 的 一 切 同 人 ， 就 是 撒 都 该 教 门 的 人 ， 都 起 来 ， 满 心 忌 恨 。 \n [kjv] Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation, \n [bbe] But the high priest and those who were with him (the Sadducees) were full of envy, \n 5:18 [hgb] 就 下 手 拿 住 使 徒 ， 收 在 外 监 。 \n [kjv] And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. \n [bbe] And they took the Apostles and put them in the common prison. \n 5:19 [hgb] 但 主 的 使 者 ， 夜 间 开 了 监 门 ， 领 他 们 出 来 ， \n [kjv] But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, \n [bbe] But in the night an angel of the Lord, opening the doors of the prison, took them out and said, \n 5:20 [hgb] 说 ， 你 们 去 站 在 殿 里 ， 把 这 生 命 的 道 ， 都 讲 给 百 姓 听 。 \n [kjv] Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. \n [bbe] Go, take your place in the Temple and give the people all the teaching about this Life. \n 5:21 [hgb] 使 徒 听 了 这 话 ， 天 将 亮 的 时 候 ， 就 进 殿 里 去 教 训 人 。 大 祭 司 和 他 的 同 人 来 了 ， 叫 齐 公 会 的 人 ， 和 以 色 列 族 的 众 长 老 ， 就 差 人 到 监 里 去 ， 要 把 使 徒 提 出 来 。 \n [kjv] And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. \n [bbe] And hearing this, they went into the Temple at dawn, and were teaching. But the high priest and those who were with him got together the Sanhedrin and the representatives of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to get them. \n 5:22 [hgb] 但 差 役 到 了 ， 不 见 他 们 在 监 里 ， 就 回 来 禀 报 说 ， \n [kjv] But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told, \n [bbe] But the men who were sent saw that they were not in the prison, and came back with the news, \n 5:23 [hgb] 我 们 看 见 监 牢 关 得 极 妥 当 ， 看 守 的 人 也 站 在 门 外 ， 及 至 开 了 门 ， 里 面 一 个 人 都 不 见 。 \n [kjv] Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. \n [bbe] Saying, The doors of the prison were safely shut, and the keepers were at the doors, but when they were open, there was nobody inside. \n 5:24 [hgb] 守 殿 官 和 祭 司 长 听 见 这 话 ， 心 里 犯 难 ， 不 知 这 事 将 来 如 何 。 \n [kjv] Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow. \n [bbe] Now, at these words, the captain of the Temple and the chief priests were greatly troubled about what might be the end of this business. \n 5:25 [hgb] 有 一 个 人 来 禀 报 说 ， 你 们 收 在 监 里 的 人 ， 现 在 站 在 殿 里 教 训 百 姓 。 \n [kjv] Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. \n [bbe] And someone came and said to them, The men, whom you put in prison, are in the Temple teaching the people. \n 5:26 [hgb] 于 是 守 殿 官 和 差 役 去 带 使 徒 来 ， 并 没 有 用 强 暴 。 因 为 怕 百 姓 用 石 头 打 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned. \n [bbe] Then the captain and some of the police went and took them, but not violently, for fear that they might be stoned by the people. \n 5:27 [hgb] 带 到 了 ， 便 叫 使 徒 站 在 公 会 前 ， 大 祭 司 问 他 们 说 ， \n [kjv] And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them, \n [bbe] And they took them into the Sanhedrin, and the high priest said to them, \n 5:28 [hgb] 我 们 不 是 严 严 地 禁 止 你 们 ， 不 可 奉 这 名 教 训 人 吗 ？ 你 们 倒 把 你 们 的 道 理 充 满 了 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 想 要 叫 这 人 的 血 归 到 我 们 身 上 。 \n [kjv] Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man\u0027s blood upon us. \n [bbe] We gave you very clear orders not to give teaching in this name: and now Jerusalem is full of your teaching, and you are attempting to make us responsible for this man\u0027s death. \n 5:29 [hgb] 彼 得 和 众 使 徒 回 答 说 ， 顺 从 神 ， 不 顺 从 人 ， 是 应 当 的 。 \n [kjv] Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. \n [bbe] But Peter and the Apostles, answering, said, We have to do the orders of God, not of man. \n 5:30 [hgb] 你 们 挂 在 木 头 上 杀 害 的 耶 稣 ， 我 们 祖 宗 的 神 已 经 叫 他 复 活 。 \n [kjv] The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. \n [bbe] The God of our fathers gave Jesus back to life, whom you had put to death, hanging him on a tree. \n 5:31 [hgb] 神 且 用 右 手 将 他 高 举 ， （ 或 作 他 就 是 神 高 举 在 自 己 的 右 边 ） 叫 他 作 君 王 ， 作 救 主 ， 将 悔 改 的 心 ， 和 赦 罪 的 恩 ， 赐 给 以 色 列 人 。 \n [kjv] Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. \n [bbe] Him God has put on high at his right hand, as a Ruler and a Saviour, to give to Israel a change of heart and forgiveness of sins. \n 5:32 [hgb] 我 们 为 这 事 作 见 证 。 神 赐 给 顺 从 之 人 的 圣 灵 ， 也 为 这 事 作 见 证 。 \n [kjv] And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. \n [bbe] And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who keep his laws. \n 5:33 [hgb] 公 会 的 人 听 见 就 极 其 恼 怒 ， 想 要 杀 他 们 。 \n [kjv] When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them. \n [bbe] But when these words came to their ears, they were cut to the heart, and had a mind to put them to death. \n 5:34 [hgb] 但 有 一 个 法 利 赛 人 ， 名 叫 迦 玛 列 ， 是 众 百 姓 所 敬 重 的 教 法 师 ， 在 公 会 中 站 起 来 ， 吩 咐 人 把 使 徒 暂 且 带 到 外 面 去 。 \n [kjv] Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; \n [bbe] But one of the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a man of learning in the law, of whom all the people had a high opinion, got up and made a suggestion for the men to be put outside for a little time. \n 5:35 [hgb] 就 对 众 人 说 ， 以 色 列 人 哪 ， 论 到 这 些 人 ， 你 们 应 当 小 心 怎 样 办 理 。 \n [kjv] And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. \n [bbe] And he said to them, Men of Israel, take care what you do about these men. \n 5:36 [hgb] 从 前 丢 大 起 来 ， 自 夸 为 大 。 附 从 他 的 人 约 有 四 百 。 他 被 杀 后 ， 附 从 他 的 全 都 散 了 ， 归 于 无 有 。 \n [kjv] For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. \n [bbe] For before this there was Theudas, who said he was someone important, to whom about four hundred men gave their support: he was put to death, and his band was broken up and came to nothing. \n 5:37 [hgb] 此 后 报 名 上 册 的 时 候 ， 又 有 加 利 利 的 犹 大 起 来 ， 引 诱 些 百 姓 跟 从 他 ， 他 也 灭 亡 ， 附 从 他 的 人 也 都 四 散 了 。 \n [kjv] After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. \n [bbe] After this man, there was Judas of Galilee, at the time of the numbering, and some of the people went after him: he was put to death, and all his supporters were put to flight. \n 5:38 [hgb] 现 在 我 劝 你 们 不 要 管 这 些 人 ， 任 凭 他 们 吧 ， 他 们 所 谋 的 ， 所 行 的 ， 若 是 出 于 人 ， 必 要 败 坏 。 \n [kjv] And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: \n [bbe] And now I say to you, Do nothing to these men, but let them be: for if this teaching or this work is of men, it will come to nothing: \n 5:39 [hgb] 若 是 出 于 神 ， 你 们 就 不 能 败 坏 他 们 。 恐 怕 你 们 倒 是 攻 击 神 了 。 \n [kjv] But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. \n [bbe] But if it is of God, you will not be able to overcome them, and you are in danger of fighting against God. \n 5:40 [hgb] 公 会 的 人 听 从 了 他 ， 便 叫 使 徒 来 ， 把 他 们 打 了 ， 又 吩 咐 他 们 不 可 奉 耶 稣 的 名 讲 道 ， 就 把 他 们 释 放 了 。 \n [kjv] And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. \n [bbe] And he seemed to them to be right: and they sent for the Apostles, and, after having them whipped and giving them orders to give no teaching in the name of Jesus, they let them go. \n 5:41 [hgb] 他 们 离 开 公 会 ， 心 里 欢 喜 。 因 被 算 是 配 为 这 名 受 辱 。 \n [kjv] And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. \n [bbe] So they went away from the Sanhedrin, happy to undergo shame for the Name. \n 5:42 [hgb] 他 们 就 每 日 在 殿 里 ， 在 家 里 ， 不 住 地 教 训 人 ， 传 耶 稣 是 基 督 。 \n [kjv] And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. \n [bbe] And every day, in the Temple and privately, they went on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2199.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
