and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. \\n\\n [bbe] And the word of God was increasing in power; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem became very great, and a great number of priests were in agreement with the faith. \\n\\n 6:8 [hgb] 司 提 反 满 得 恩 惠 能 力 ， 在 民 间 行 了 大 奇 事 和 神 迹 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. \\n\\n [bbe] And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people. \\n\\n 6:9 [hgb] 当 时 有 称 利 百 地 拿 会 堂 的 几 个 人 ， 并 有 古 利 奈 ， 亚 力 山 太 ， 基 利 家 ， 亚 西 亚 ， 各 处 会 堂 的 几 个 人 ， 都 起 来 ， 和 司 提 反 辩 论 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. \\n\\n [bbe] But some of those who were of the Synagogue named that of the Libertines, and some of the men of Cyrene and of Alexandria and those from Cilicia and Asia, had arguments with Stephen. \\n\\n 6:10 [hgb] 司 提 反 是 以 智 慧 和 圣 灵 说 话 ， 众 人 敌 挡 不 住 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. \\n\\n [bbe] But they were not able to get the better of him, for his words were full of wisdom and of the Spirit. \\n\\n 6:11 [hgb] 就 买 出 人 来 说 ， 我 们 听 见 他 说 谤 ？ ？ 摩 西 ， 和 神 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. \\n\\n [bbe] Then they got men to say, He has said evil against Moses and against God, in our hearing. \\n\\n 6:12 [hgb] 他 们 又 耸 动 了 百 姓 ， 长 老 ， 并 文 士 ， 就 忽 然 来 捉 拿 他 ， 把 他 带 到 公 会 去 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, \\n\\n [bbe] And the people, with the rulers and the scribes, were moved against him, and they came and took him before the Sanhedrin, \\n\\n 6:13 [hgb] 设 下 假 见 证 说 ， 这 个 人 说 话 ， 不 住 地 糟 践 圣 所 和 律 法 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: \\n\\n [bbe] And they got false witnesses who said, This man is for ever saying things against this holy place and against the law: \\n\\n 6:14 [hgb] 我 们 曾 听 见 他 说 ， 这 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 ， 要 毁 坏 此 地 ， 也 要 改 变 摩 西 所 交 给 我 们 的 规 条 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. \\n\\n [bbe] For he has said in our hearing that this Jesus of Nazareth will put this place to destruction and make changes in the rules which were handed down to us by Moses. \\n\\n 6:15 [hgb] 在 公 会 里 坐 着 的 人 ， 都 定 睛 看 他 ， 见 他 的 面 貌 ， 好 像 天 使 的 面 貌 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. \\n\\n [bbe] And all those who were in the Sanhedrin, looking at him, saw that his face was like the face of an angel. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2200.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
