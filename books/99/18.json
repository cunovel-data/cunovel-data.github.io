{"id":2493,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"18:1 [hgb] 这 事 以 后 ， 保 罗 离 了 雅 典 ， 来 到 哥 林 多 。 \n [kjv] After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; \n [bbe] After these things, he went away from Athens, and came to Corinth. \n 18:2 [hgb] 遇 见 一 个 犹 太 人 ， 名 叫 亚 居 拉 ， 他 生 在 本 都 。 因 为 革 老 丢 命 犹 太 人 都 离 开 罗 马 ， 新 近 带 着 妻 百 基 拉 ， 从 义 大 利 来 。 保 罗 就 投 奔 了 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. \n [bbe] And there he came across a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by birth, who not long before had come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had given orders that all Jews were to go away from Rome: and he came to them; \n 18:3 [hgb] 他 们 本 是 制 造 帐 棚 为 业 。 保 罗 因 与 他 们 同 业 ， 就 和 他 们 同 住 作 工 。 \n [kjv] And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. \n [bbe] And because he was of the same trade, he was living with them, and they did their work together; for by trade they were tent-makers. \n 18:4 [hgb] 每 逢 安 息 日 ， 保 罗 在 会 堂 里 辩 论 ， 劝 化 犹 太 人 和 希 利 尼 人 。 \n [kjv] And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. \n [bbe] And every Sabbath he had discussions in the Synagogue, turning Jews and Greeks to the faith. \n 18:5 [hgb] 西 拉 和 提 摩 太 从 马 其 顿 来 的 时 候 ， 保 罗 为 道 迫 切 ， 向 犹 太 人 证 明 耶 稣 是 基 督 。 \n [kjv] And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. \n [bbe] And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was completely given up to the word, preaching to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus. \n 18:6 [hgb] 他 们 既 抗 拒 ， 毁 谤 ， 保 罗 就 抖 着 衣 裳 说 ， 你 们 的 罪 归 到 你 们 自 己 头 上 ， （ 罪 原 文 作 血 ） 与 我 无 干 ， （ 原 文 作 我 却 干 净 ） 从 今 以 后 ， 我 要 往 外 邦 人 那 里 去 ， \n [kjv] And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. \n [bbe] And when they put themselves against him, and said evil words, he said, shaking his clothing, Your blood be on your heads, I am clean: from now I will go to the Gentiles. \n 18:7 [hgb] 于 是 离 开 那 里 ， 到 了 一 个 人 的 家 中 ， 这 人 名 叫 提 多 犹 士 都 ， 是 敬 拜 神 的 ， 他 的 家 靠 近 会 堂 。 \n [kjv] And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man\u0027s house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. \n [bbe] And moving from there, he went into the house of a man named Titus Justus, a God-fearing man, whose house was very near the Synagogue. \n 18:8 [hgb] 管 会 堂 的 基 利 司 布 和 全 家 都 信 了 主 。 还 有 许 多 哥 林 多 人 听 了 ， 就 相 信 受 洗 。 \n [kjv] And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. \n [bbe] And Crispus, the ruler of the Synagogue, with all his family, had faith in the Lord; and a great number of the people of Corinth, hearing the word, had faith and were given baptism. \n 18:9 [hgb] 夜 间 主 在 异 象 中 对 保 罗 说 ， 不 要 怕 ， 只 管 讲 ， 不 要 闭 口 。 \n [kjv] Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Paul in the night, in a vision, Have no fear and go on preaching: \n 18:10 [hgb] 有 我 与 你 同 在 ， 必 没 有 人 下 手 害 你 。 因 为 在 这 城 里 我 有 许 多 的 百 姓 。 \n [kjv] For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. \n [bbe] For I am with you, and no one will make an attack on you to do you damage: for I have a number of people in this town. \n 18:11 [hgb] 保 罗 在 那 里 住 了 一 年 零 六 个 月 ， 将 神 的 道 教 训 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. \n [bbe] And he was there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. \n 18:12 [hgb] 到 迦 流 作 亚 该 亚 方 伯 的 时 候 ， 犹 太 人 同 心 起 来 攻 击 保 罗 ， 拉 他 到 公 堂 ， \n [kjv] And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, \n [bbe] But when Gallio was ruler of Achaia, all the Jews together made an attack on Paul, and took him to the judge\u0027s seat, \n 18:13 [hgb] 说 ， 这 个 人 劝 人 不 按 着 律 法 敬 拜 神 。 \n [kjv] Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. \n [bbe] Saying, This man is teaching the people to give worship to God in a way which is against the law. \n 18:14 [hgb] 保 罗 刚 要 开 口 ， 迦 流 就 对 犹 太 人 说 ， 你 们 这 些 犹 太 人 ， 如 果 是 为 冤 枉 ， 或 奸 恶 的 事 ， 我 理 当 耐 性 听 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: \n [bbe] But when Paul was about to say something, Gallio said to the Jews, If this was anything to do with wrongdoing or crime, there would be a reason for me to give you a hearing: \n 18:15 [hgb] 但 所 争 论 的 ， 若 是 关 乎 言 语 ， 名 目 ， 和 你 们 的 律 法 ， 你 们 自 己 去 办 吧 。 这 样 的 事 我 不 愿 意 审 问 。 \n [kjv] But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. \n [bbe] But if it is a question of words or names or of your law, see to it yourselves; I will not be a judge of such things. \n 18:16 [hgb] 就 把 他 们 撵 出 公 堂 。 \n [kjv] And he drave them from the judgment seat. \n [bbe] And he sent them away from the judge\u0027s seat. \n 18:17 [hgb] 众 人 便 揪 住 管 会 堂 的 所 提 尼 ， 在 堂 前 打 他 。 这 些 事 迦 流 都 不 管 。 \n [kjv] Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. \n [bbe] And they all made an attack on Sosthenes, the ruler of the Synagogue, and gave him blows before the judge\u0027s seat; but Gallio gave no attention to these things. \n 18:18 [hgb] 保 罗 又 住 了 多 日 ， 就 辞 别 了 弟 兄 ， 坐 船 往 叙 利 亚 去 ， 百 基 拉 ， 亚 居 拉 和 他 同 去 。 他 因 为 许 过 愿 ， 就 在 坚 革 哩 剪 了 头 发 。 \n [kjv] And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. \n [bbe] And Paul, after waiting some days, went away from the brothers and went by ship to Syria, Priscilla and Aquila being with him; and he had had his hair cut off in Cenchrea, for he had taken an oath. \n 18:19 [hgb] 到 了 以 弗 所 ， 保 罗 就 把 他 们 留 在 那 里 ， 自 己 进 了 会 堂 ， 和 犹 太 人 辩 论 。 \n [kjv] And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. \n [bbe] And they came down to Ephesus and he left them there: and he himself went into the Synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews. \n 18:20 [hgb] 众 人 请 他 多 住 些 日 子 ， 他 却 不 允 。 \n [kjv] When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; \n [bbe] And being requested by them to be there for a longer time, he said, No; \n 18:21 [hgb] 就 辞 别 他 们 说 ， 神 若 许 我 ， 我 还 要 回 到 你 们 这 里 。 于 是 开 船 离 了 以 弗 所 。 \n [kjv] But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. \n [bbe] And went from them, saying, I will come back to you if God lets me; and he took ship from Ephesus. \n 18:22 [hgb] 在 该 撒 利 亚 下 了 船 ， 就 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 问 教 会 安 ， 随 后 下 安 提 阿 去 。 \n [kjv] And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. \n [bbe] And when he had come to land at Caesarea, he went to see the church, and then went down to Antioch. \n 18:23 [hgb] 住 了 些 日 子 ， 又 离 开 那 里 ， 挨 次 经 过 加 拉 太 和 弗 吕 家 地 方 ， 坚 固 众 门 徒 。 \n [kjv] And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. \n [bbe] And having been there for some time, he went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, making the disciples strong in the faith. \n 18:24 [hgb] 有 一 个 犹 太 人 ， 名 叫 亚 波 罗 ， 来 到 以 弗 所 。 他 生 在 亚 力 山 太 ， 是 有 学 问 的 ， 最 能 讲 解 圣 经 。 （ 学 问 或 作 口 才 ） 。 \n [kjv] And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. \n [bbe] Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, and a man of learning, came to Ephesus; and he had great knowledge of the holy Writings. \n 18:25 [hgb] 这 人 已 经 在 主 的 道 上 受 了 教 训 ， 心 里 火 热 ， 将 耶 稣 的 事 ， 详 细 讲 论 教 训 人 。 只 是 他 单 晓 得 约 翰 的 洗 礼 。 \n [kjv] This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. \n [bbe] This man had been trained in the way of the Lord; and burning in spirit, he gave himself up to teaching the facts about Jesus, though he had knowledge only of John\u0027s baptism: \n 18:26 [hgb] 他 在 会 堂 里 放 胆 讲 道 ， 百 基 拉 ， 亚 居 拉 听 见 ， 就 接 他 来 ， 将 神 的 道 给 他 讲 解 更 加 详 细 。 \n [kjv] And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. \n [bbe] And he was preaching in the Synagogue without fear. But Priscilla and Aquila, hearing his words, took him in, and gave him fuller teaching about the way of God. \n 18:27 [hgb] 他 想 要 往 亚 该 亚 去 。 弟 兄 们 就 勉 励 他 ， 并 写 信 请 门 徒 接 待 他 。 （ 或 作 弟 兄 们 就 写 信 劝 门 徒 接 待 他 ） 他 到 了 那 里 ， 多 帮 助 那 蒙 恩 信 主 的 人 。 \n [kjv] And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: \n [bbe] And when he had a desire to go over into Achaia, the brothers gave him help, and sent letters to the disciples requesting them to take him in among them: and when he had come, he gave much help to those who had faith through grace: \n 18:28 [hgb] 在 众 人 面 前 极 有 能 力 ， 驳 倒 犹 太 人 ， 引 圣 经 证 明 耶 稣 是 基 督 。 \n [kjv] For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. \n [bbe] For he overcame the Jews in public discussion, making clear from the holy Writings that the Christ was Jesus. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2212.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
