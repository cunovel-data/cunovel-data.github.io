{"id":2485,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"10:1 [hgb] 在 该 撒 利 亚 有 一 个 人 ， 名 叫 哥 尼 流 ， 是 义 大 利 营 的 百 夫 长 。 [kjv] There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, [bbe] Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius, the captain of the Italian band of the army; 10:2 [hgb] 他 是 个 虔 诚 人 ， 他 和 全 家 都 敬 畏 神 ， 多 多 周 济 百 姓 ， 常 常 祷 告 神 。 [kjv] A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. [bbe] A serious-minded man, fearing God with all his family; he gave much money to the poor, and made prayer to God at all times. 10:3 [hgb] 有 一 天 ， 约 在 申 初 ， 他 在 异 象 中 ， 明 明 看 见 神 的 一 个 使 者 进 去 ， 到 他 那 里 ， 说 ， 哥 尼 流 。 [kjv] He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. [bbe] He saw in a vision, clearly, at about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of the Lord coming to him and saying to him, Cornelius! 10:4 [hgb] 哥 尼 流 定 睛 看 他 ， 惊 怕 说 ， 主 阿 ， 什 么 事 呢 ？ 天 使 说 ， 你 的 祷 告 ， 和 你 的 周 济 ， 达 到 神 面 前 已 蒙 记 念 了 。 [kjv] And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. [bbe] And he, looking on him in fear, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your offerings have come up to God, and he has kept them in mind. 10:5 [hgb] 现 在 你 当 打 发 人 往 约 帕 去 ， 请 那 称 呼 彼 得 的 西 门 来 。 [kjv] And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter: [bbe] Now send men to Joppa, and get one Simon, named Peter, 10:6 [hgb] 他 住 在 海 边 一 个 硝 皮 匠 西 门 的 家 里 。 房 子 在 海 边 上 。 [kjv] He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. [bbe] Who is living with Simon, a leather-worker, whose house is by the sea. 10:7 [hgb] 向 他 说 话 的 天 使 去 后 ， 哥 尼 流 叫 了 两 个 家 人 ， 和 常 伺 候 他 的 一 个 虔 诚 兵 来 。 [kjv] And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; [bbe] And when the angel who said these words to him had gone away, he sent for two of his house-servants, and a God-fearing man of the army, one of those who were waiting on him at all times; 10:8 [hgb] 把 这 事 都 述 说 给 他 们 听 ， 就 打 发 他 们 往 约 帕 去 。 [kjv] And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. [bbe] And having given them an account of everything, he sent them to Joppa. 10:9 [hgb] 第 二 天 ， 他 们 行 路 将 近 那 城 ， 彼 得 约 在 午 正 ， 上 房 顶 去 祷 告 。 [kjv] On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: [bbe] Now the day after, when they were on their journey and were near the town, Peter went up to the top of the house for prayer, about the sixth hour: 10:10 [hgb] 觉 得 饿 了 ， 想 要 吃 。 那 家 的 人 正 预 备 饭 的 时 候 ， 彼 得 魂 游 象 外 。 [kjv] And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, [bbe] And he was in need of food: but while they were getting it ready, a deep sleep came on him; 10:11 [hgb] 看 见 天 开 了 ， 有 一 物 降 下 ， 好 像 一 块 大 布 。 系 着 四 角 ， 缒 在 地 上 。 [kjv] And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: [bbe] And he saw the heavens opening, and a vessel coming down, like a great cloth let down on the earth, 10:12 [hgb] 里 面 有 地 上 各 样 四 足 的 走 兽 ， 和 昆 虫 ， 并 天 上 的 飞 鸟 。 [kjv] Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. [bbe] In which were all sorts of beasts and birds. 10:13 [hgb] 又 有 声 音 向 他 说 ， 彼 得 起 来 ， 宰 了 吃 。 [kjv] And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. [bbe] And a voice came to him, saying, Come, Peter; take them for food. 10:14 [hgb] 彼 得 却 说 ， 主 阿 ， 这 是 不 可 的 ， 凡 俗 物 ， 和 不 洁 净 的 物 ， 我 从 来 没 有 吃 过 。 [kjv] But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. [bbe] But Peter said, No, Lord; for I have never taken food which is common or unclean. 10:15 [hgb] 第 二 次 有 声 音 向 他 说 ， 神 所 洁 净 的 ， 你 不 可 当 作 俗 物 。 [kjv] And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. [bbe] And the voice came to him a second time, What God has made clean, do not you make common. 10:16 [hgb] 这 样 一 连 三 次 ， 那 物 随 即 收 回 天 上 去 了 。 [kjv] This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven. [bbe] And this was done three times: and then the vessel was taken back into heaven. 10:17 [hgb] 彼 得 心 里 正 在 猜 疑 之 间 ， 不 知 所 看 见 的 异 象 是 什 么 意 思 ， 哥 尼 流 所 差 来 的 人 ， 已 经 访 问 到 西 门 的 家 ， 站 在 门 外 ， [kjv] Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon\u0027s house, and stood before the gate, [bbe] Now while Peter was in doubt as to the purpose of this vision, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made search for Simon\u0027s house, came to the door, 10:18 [hgb] 喊 着 问 ， 有 称 呼 彼 得 的 西 门 住 在 这 里 没 有 。 [kjv] And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. [bbe] To see if Simon, named Peter, was living there. 10:19 [hgb] 彼 得 还 思 想 那 异 象 的 时 候 ， 圣 灵 向 他 说 ， 有 三 个 人 来 找 你 。 [kjv] While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. [bbe] And, while Peter was turning the vision over in his mind, the Spirit said to him, See, three men are looking for you. 10:20 [hgb] 起 来 ， 下 去 ， 和 他 们 同 往 ， 不 要 疑 惑 。 因 为 是 我 差 他 们 来 的 。 [kjv] Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. [bbe] Go down, then, and go with them, doubting nothing, for I have sent them. 10:21 [hgb] 于 是 彼 得 下 去 见 那 些 人 ， 说 ， 我 就 是 你 们 所 找 的 人 。 你 们 来 是 为 什 么 缘 故 。 [kjv] Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? [bbe] And Peter went down to the men, and said, I am the man you are looking for: why have you come? 10:22 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 百 夫 长 哥 尼 流 是 个 义 人 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 为 犹 太 通 国 所 称 赞 ， 他 蒙 一 位 圣 天 使 指 示 ， 叫 他 请 你 到 他 家 里 去 ， 听 你 的 话 。 [kjv] And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. [bbe] And they said, Cornelius, a captain, an upright and God-fearing man, respected by all the nation of the Jews, had word from God by an angel to send for you to his house, and to give hearing to your words. 10:23 [hgb] 彼 得 就 请 他 们 进 去 ， 住 了 一 宿 。 次 日 起 身 和 他 们 同 去 ， 还 有 约 帕 的 几 个 弟 兄 同 着 他 去 。 [kjv] Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him. [bbe] So he took them in for the night. And the day after, he went with them, taking some of the brothers from Joppa with him. 10:24 [hgb] 又 次 日 ， 他 们 进 入 该 撒 利 亚 。 哥 尼 流 已 经 请 了 他 的 亲 属 密 友 ， 等 候 他 们 。 [kjv] And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. [bbe] And the day after that, they came to Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having got together his relations and his near friends. 10:25 [hgb] 彼 得 一 进 去 ， 哥 尼 流 就 迎 接 他 ， 俯 伏 在 他 脚 前 拜 他 。 [kjv] And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. [bbe] And when Peter came in, Cornelius came to him and, falling down at his feet, gave him worship. 10:26 [hgb] 彼 得 却 拉 他 说 ， 你 起 来 ， 我 也 是 人 。 [kjv] But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. [bbe] But Peter, lifting him up, said, Get up, for I am a man as you are. 10:27 [hgb] 彼 得 和 他 说 着 话 进 去 ， 见 有 好 些 人 在 那 里 聚 集 ， [kjv] And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. [bbe] And saying these words, he went in, and saw that a great number of people had come together; 10:28 [hgb] 就 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 知 道 犹 太 人 ， 和 别 国 的 人 亲 近 来 往 ， 本 是 不 合 例 的 。 但 神 已 经 指 示 我 ， 无 论 什 么 人 ， 都 不 可 看 作 俗 而 不 洁 净 的 。 [kjv] And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. [bbe] And he said to them, You yourselves have knowledge that it is against the law for a man who is a Jew to be in the company of one who is of another nation; but God has made it clear to me that no man may be named common or unclean: 10:29 [hgb] 所 以 我 被 请 的 时 候 ， 就 不 推 辞 而 来 。 现 在 请 问 ， 你 们 叫 我 来 有 什 么 意 思 呢 ？ [kjv] Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? [bbe] And so I came without question, when I was sent for. What then is your purpose in sending for me? 10:30 [hgb] 哥 尼 流 说 ， 前 四 天 这 个 时 候 ， 我 在 家 中 守 着 申 初 的 祷 告 ， 忽 然 有 一 个 人 ， 穿 着 光 明 的 衣 裳 ， 站 在 我 面 前 ， [kjv] And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, [bbe] And Cornelius said, Four days from now I was in my house in prayer at the ninth hour; and I saw before me a man in shining clothing, 10:31 [hgb] 说 ， 哥 尼 流 ， 你 的 祷 告 ， 已 蒙 垂 听 ， 你 的 周 济 ， 达 到 神 面 前 已 蒙 记 念 了 。 [kjv] And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. [bbe] Who said, Cornelius, your prayer has come to the ears of God, and your offerings are kept in his memory. 10:32 [hgb] 你 当 打 发 人 往 约 帕 去 ， 请 那 称 呼 彼 得 的 西 门 来 ， 他 住 在 海 边 一 个 硝 皮 匠 西 门 的 家 里 。 [kjv] Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. [bbe] Send, then, to Joppa, and get Simon, named Peter, to come to you; he is living in the house of Simon, a leather-worker, by the sea. 10:33 [hgb] 所 以 我 立 时 打 发 人 去 请 你 ， 你 来 了 很 好 。 现 今 我 们 都 在 神 面 前 ， 要 听 主 所 吩 咐 你 的 一 切 话 。 [kjv] Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. [bbe] So, straight away, I sent for you; and you have done well to come. And now, we are all present before God, ready to give attention to all the things which the Lord has given you to say. 10:34 [hgb] 彼 得 就 开 口 说 ， 我 真 看 出 神 是 不 偏 待 人 。 [kjv] Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: [bbe] Then Peter said, Truly, I see clearly that God is no respecter of persons: 10:35 [hgb] 原 来 各 国 中 ， 那 敬 畏 主 行 义 的 人 ， 都 为 主 所 悦 纳 。 [kjv] But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. [bbe] But in every nation, the man who has fear of him and does righteousness is pleasing to him. 10:36 [hgb] 神 借 着 耶 稣 基 督 （ 他 是 万 有 的 主 ） 传 和 平 的 福 音 ， 将 这 道 赐 给 以 色 列 人 。 [kjv] The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) [bbe] The word which he sent to the children of Israel, giving the good news of peace through Jesus Christ (who is Lord of all)-- 10:37 [hgb] 这 话 在 约 翰 宣 传 洗 礼 以 后 ， 从 加 利 利 起 ， 传 遍 了 犹 太 。 [kjv] That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; [bbe] That word you yourselves have knowledge of, which was made public through all Judaea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism of which John was the preacher, 10:38 [hgb] 神 怎 样 以 圣 灵 和 能 力 ， 膏 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 ， 这 都 是 你 们 知 道 的 。 他 周 流 四 方 行 善 事 ， 医 好 凡 被 魔 鬼 压 制 的 人 。 因 为 神 与 他 同 在 。 [kjv] How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. [bbe] About Jesus of Nazareth, how God gave the Holy Spirit to him, with power: and how he went about doing good and making well all who were troubled by evil spirits, for God was with him. 10:39 [hgb] 他 在 犹 太 人 之 地 ， 并 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 所 行 的 一 切 事 ， 有 我 们 作 见 证 。 他 们 竟 把 他 挂 在 木 头 上 杀 了 。 [kjv] And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: [bbe] And we are witnesses of all the things which he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they put to death, hanging him on a tree. 10:40 [hgb] 第 三 日 神 叫 他 复 活 ， 显 现 出 来 ， [kjv] Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; [bbe] On the third day God gave him back to life, and let him be seen, 10:41 [hgb] 不 是 显 现 给 众 人 看 ， 乃 是 显 现 给 神 预 先 所 拣 选 为 他 作 见 证 的 人 看 ， 就 是 我 们 这 些 在 他 从 死 里 复 活 以 后 ， 和 他 同 吃 同 喝 的 人 。 [kjv] Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. [bbe] Not by all the people, but by witnesses marked out before by God, even by us, who took food and drink with him after he came back from the dead. 10:42 [hgb] 他 吩 咐 我 们 传 道 给 众 人 ， 证 明 他 是 神 所 立 定 的 ， 要 作 审 判 活 人 死 人 的 主 。 [kjv] And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. [bbe] And he gave us orders to give news of this to the people, and to give public witness that this is he whom God has made judge of the living and the dead. 10:43 [hgb] 众 先 知 也 为 他 作 见 证 ， 说 ， 凡 信 他 的 人 ， 必 因 他 的 名 ， 得 蒙 赦 罪 。 [kjv] To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. [bbe] To him all the prophets give witness, that through his name everyone who has faith in him will have forgiveness of sins. 10:44 [hgb] 彼 得 还 说 这 话 的 时 候 ， 圣 灵 降 在 一 切 听 道 的 人 身 上 。 [kjv] While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. [bbe] While Peter was saying these words, the Holy Spirit came on all those who were hearing the word. 10:45 [hgb] 那 些 奉 割 礼 和 彼 得 同 来 的 信 徒 ， 见 圣 灵 的 恩 赐 也 浇 在 外 邦 人 身 上 ， 就 都 希 奇 。 [kjv] And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. [bbe] And the Jews of the faith, who had come with Peter, were full of wonder, because the Holy Spirit was given to the Gentiles, 10:46 [hgb] 因 听 见 他 们 说 方 言 ， 称 赞 神 为 大 。 [kjv] For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, [bbe] And they were talking in tongues, and giving glory to God. Then Peter said, 10:47 [hgb] 于 是 彼 得 说 ， 这 些 人 既 受 了 圣 灵 ， 与 我 们 一 样 ， 谁 能 禁 止 用 水 给 他 们 施 洗 呢 ？ [kjv] Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? [bbe] Will any man say that these may not have baptism who have been given the Holy Spirit as we have? 10:48 [hgb] 就 吩 咐 奉 耶 稣 基 督 的 名 给 他 们 施 洗 。 他 们 又 请 彼 得 住 了 几 天 。 [kjv] And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. [bbe] And he gave orders for them to have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they kept him with them for some days.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2204.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
