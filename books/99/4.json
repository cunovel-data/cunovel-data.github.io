\n [bbe] Then sending for Peter and John, they said, By what power and in whose name have you done this? \n 4:8 [hgb] 那 时 ， 彼 得 被 圣 灵 充 满 ， 对 他 们 说 ， \n [kjv] Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, \n [bbe] Then Peter, being full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, O you rulers of the people and men of authority, \n 4:9 [hgb] 治 民 的 官 府 ， 和 长 老 阿 ， 倘 若 今 日 ， 因 为 在 残 疾 人 身 上 所 行 的 善 事 ， 查 问 我 们 他 是 怎 么 得 了 痊 愈 。 \n [kjv] If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; \n [bbe] If we are questioned today about a good work done to a man who was ill, as to how he has been made well, \n 4:10 [hgb] 你 们 众 人 ， 和 以 色 列 百 姓 ， 都 当 知 道 ， 站 在 你 们 面 前 的 这 人 得 痊 愈 ， 是 因 你 们 所 钉 十 字 架 ， 神 叫 他 从 死 里 复 活 的 ， 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 基 督 的 名 。 \n [kjv] Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. \n [bbe] Take note, all of you, and all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you put to death on the cross, whom God gave back from the dead, even through him is this man now before you completely well. \n 4:11 [hgb] 他 是 你 们 匠 人 所 弃 的 石 头 ， 已 成 了 房 角 的 头 块 石 头 。 \n [kjv] This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. \n [bbe] He is the stone which you builders had no use for, but which has been made the chief stone of the building. \n 4:12 [hgb] 除 他 以 外 ， 别 无 拯 救 。 因 为 在 天 下 人 间 ， 没 有 赐 下 别 的 名 ， 我 们 可 以 靠 着 得 救 。 \n [kjv] Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. \n [bbe] And in no other is there salvation: for there is no other name under heaven, given among men, through which we may have salvation. \n 4:13 [hgb] 他 们 见 彼 得 约 翰 的 胆 量 ， 又 看 出 他 们 原 是 没 有 学 问 的 小 民 ， 就 希 奇 ， 认 明 他 们 是 跟 过 耶 稣 的 。 \n [kjv] Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. \n [bbe] Now when they saw that Peter and John were without fear, though they were men of no education or learning, they were greatly surprised; and they took note of them that they had been with Jesus. \n 4:14 [hgb] 又 看 见 那 治 好 了 的 人 ， 和 他 们 一 同 站 着 ， 就 无 话 可 驳 。 \n [kjv] And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. \n [bbe] And, seeing that the man who had been made well was there with them, they were not able to say anything against it. \n 4:15 [hgb] 于 是 吩 咐 他 们 从 公 会 出 去 ， 就 彼 此 商 议 说 ， \n [kjv] But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, \n [bbe] But when they had given them orders to go out of the Sanhedrin, they had a discussion among themselves, \n 4:16 [hgb] 我 们 当 怎 样 办 这 两 个 人 呢 ？ 因 为 他 们 诚 然 行 了 一 件 明 显 的 神 迹 ， 凡 住 耶 路 撒 冷 的 人 都 知 道 ， 我 们 也 不 能 说 没 有 。 \n [kjv] Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. \n [bbe] Saying, What are we to do with these men? for certainly it is clear to all who are living in Jerusalem that a most important sign has been done by them, and it is not possible to say that it is not so. \n 4:17 [hgb] 惟 恐 这 事 越 发 传 扬 在 民 间 ， 我 们 必 须 恐 吓 他 们 ， 叫 他 们 不 再 奉 这 名 对 人 讲 论 。 \n [kjv] But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. \n [bbe] But so that it may not go farther among the people, let us put them in fear of punishment if they say anything in future in this name. \n 4:18 [hgb] 于 是 叫 了 他 们 来 ， 禁 止 他 们 ， 总 不 可 奉 耶 稣 的 名 讲 论 教 训 人 。 \n [kjv] And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. \n [bbe] And they sent for them, and gave them orders not to make statements or give teaching in the name of Jesus. \n 4:19 [hgb] 彼 得 约 翰 说 ， 听 从 你 们 ， 不 听 从 神 ， 这 在 神 面 前 合 理 不 合 理 ， 你 们 自 己 酌 量 吧 。 \n [kjv] But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. \n [bbe] But Peter and John in answer said to them, It is for you to say if it is right in the eyes of God to give attention to you more than to God: \n 4:20 [hgb] 我 们 所 看 见 所 听 见 的 ， 不 能 不 说 。 \n [kjv] For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. \n [bbe] For it is not possible for us to keep from saying what we have seen and have knowledge of. \n 4:21 [hgb] 官 长 为 百 姓 的 缘 故 ， 想 不 出 法 子 刑 罚 他 们 ， 又 恐 吓 一 番 ， 把 他 们 释 放 了 。 这 是 因 众 人 为 所 行 的 奇 事 ， 都 归 荣 耀 与 神 。 \n [kjv] So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done. \n [bbe] And when they had said more sharp words to them, they let them go, not seeing what punishment they might give them, because of the people; for all men were giving praise to God for what had taken place. \n 4:22 [hgb] 原 来 借 着 神 迹 医 好 的 那 人 ， 有 四 十 多 岁 了 。 \n [kjv] For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed. \n [bbe] For the man on whom this act of power was done was more than forty years old. \n 4:23 [hgb] 二 人 既 被 释 放 ， 就 到 会 友 那 里 去 ， 把 祭 司 长 和 长 老 所 说 的 话 ， 都 告 诉 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. \n [bbe] And when they had been made free, they came back to their friends, and gave an account of all the things which the chief priests and the authorities had said to them. \n 4:24 [hgb] 他 们 听 见 了 ， 就 同 心 合 意 地 ， 高 声 向 神 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 是 造 天 ， 地 ， 海 ， 和 其 中 万 物 的 。 \n [kjv] And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: \n [bbe] And hearing it, they all, with one mind, made prayer to God and said, O Lord, maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them: \n 4:25 [hgb] 你 曾 借 着 圣 灵 ， 托 你 仆 人 我 们 祖 宗 大 卫 的 口 ， 说 ， 外 邦 为 什 么 争 闹 ， 万 民 为 什 么 谋 算 虚 妄 的 事 。 \n [kjv] Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? \n [bbe] Who has said, by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David your servant, Why are the nations so violently moved, and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish? \n 4:26 [hgb] 世 上 的 君 王 一 齐 起 来 ， 臣 宰 也 聚 集 ， 要 敌 挡 主 ， 并 主 的 受 膏 者 。 （ 或 作 基 督 ） \n [kjv] The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. \n [bbe] The kings of the earth were lifted up, the rulers came together, against the Lord, and against his Christ: \n 4:27 [hgb] 希 律 和 本 丢 彼 拉 多 ， 外 邦 人 和 以 色 列 民 ， 果 然 在 这 城 里 聚 集 ， 要 攻 打 你 所 膏 的 圣 仆 耶 稣 ， （ 仆 或 作 子 ） 。 \n [kjv] For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, \n [bbe] For, truly, in this town, against your holy servant, Jesus, who was marked out by you as Christ, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, came together, \n 4:28 [hgb] 成 就 你 手 和 你 意 旨 所 预 定 必 有 的 事 。 \n [kjv] For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. \n [bbe] To do that which had been fixed before by your hand and your purpose. \n 4:29 [hgb] 他 们 恐 吓 我 们 ， 现 在 求 主 鉴 察 。 一 面 叫 你 仆 人 大 放 胆 量 ， 讲 你 的 道 ， 一 面 伸 出 你 的 手 来 ， 医 治 疾 病 ， 并 且 使 神 迹 奇 事 ， 因 着 你 圣 仆 耶 稣 的 名 行 出 来 （ 仆 或 作 子 ） 。 \n [kjv] And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, \n [bbe] And now, Lord, take note of their cruel words, and give your servants power to be preachers of your word without fear, \n 4:30 [hgb] \n [kjv] By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. \n [bbe] While your hand is stretched out to do works of mercy; so that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus. \n 4:31 [hgb] 祷 告 完 了 ， 聚 会 的 地 方 震 动 ， 他 们 就 都 被 圣 灵 充 满 ， 放 胆 讲 论 神 的 道 。 \n [kjv] And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. \n [bbe] And when their prayer was ended, the place where they were was violently moved, and they all became full of the Holy Spirit, preaching the word of God without fear. \n 4:32 [hgb] 那 许 多 信 的 人 ， 都 是 一 心 一 意 的 ， 没 有 一 人 说 ， 他 的 东 西 有 一 样 是 自 己 的 ， 都 是 大 家 公 用 。 \n [kjv] And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. \n [bbe] And all those who were of the faith were one in heart and soul: and not one of them said that any of the things which he had was his property only; but they had all things in common. \n 4:33 [hgb] 使 徒 大 有 能 力 ， 见 证 主 耶 稣 复 活 。 众 人 也 都 蒙 大 恩 。 \n [kjv] And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. \n [bbe] And with great power the Apostles gave witness of the coming back of the Lord Jesus from the dead; and grace was on them all. \n 4:34 [hgb] 内 中 也 没 有 一 个 缺 乏 的 ， 因 为 人 人 将 田 产 房 屋 都 卖 了 ， 把 所 卖 的 价 银 拿 来 ， 放 在 使 徒 脚 前 。 \n [kjv] Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, \n [bbe] And no one among them was in need; for everyone who had land or houses, exchanging them for money, took the price of them, \n 4:35 [hgb] 照 各 人 所 需 用 的 ， 分 给 各 人 。 \n [kjv] And laid them down at the apostles\u0027 feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. \n [bbe] And put it at the feet of the Apostles for distribution to everyone as he had need. \n 4:36 [hgb] 有 一 个 利 未 人 ， 生 在 居 比 路 ， 名 叫 约 瑟 ， 使 徒 称 他 为 巴 拿 巴 。 （ 巴 拿 巴 翻 出 来 ， 就 是 劝 慰 子 ） 。 \n [kjv] And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, \n [bbe] And Joseph, who was given by the Apostles the name of Barnabas (the sense of which is, Son of comfort), a Levite and a man of Cyprus by birth, \n 4:37 [hgb] 他 有 田 地 ， 也 卖 了 ， 把 价 银 拿 来 ， 放 在 使 徒 脚 前 。 \n [kjv] Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles\u0027 feet. \n [bbe] Having a field, got money for it and put the money at the feet of the Apostles. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2198.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
