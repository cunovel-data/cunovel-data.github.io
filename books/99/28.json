{"id":2503,"no":28,"title":"Chapter 28","content":"28:1 [hgb] 我 们 既 已 得 救 ， 才 知 道 那 岛 名 叫 米 利 大 。 [kjv] And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. [bbe] And when we were safe, we made the discovery that the island was named Melita. 28:2 [hgb] 土 人 看 待 我 们 ， 有 非 常 的 情 分 ， 因 为 当 时 下 雨 ， 天 气 又 冷 ， 就 生 火 ， 接 待 我 们 众 人 。 [kjv] And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. [bbe] And the simple people living there were uncommonly kind to us, for they made a fire for us, and took us in, because it was raining and cold. 28:3 [hgb] 那 时 保 罗 拾 起 一 捆 柴 ， 放 在 火 上 ， 有 一 条 毒 蛇 ， 因 为 热 了 出 来 ， 咬 住 他 的 手 。 [kjv] And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. [bbe] But when Paul had got some sticks together and put them on the fire, a snake came out, because of the heat, and gave him a bite on the hand. 28:4 [hgb] 土 人 看 见 那 毒 蛇 ， 悬 在 他 手 上 ， 就 彼 此 说 ， 这 人 必 是 个 凶 手 ， 虽 然 从 海 里 救 上 来 ， 天 理 还 不 容 他 活 着 。 [kjv] And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. [bbe] And when the people saw it hanging on his hand, they said to one another, Without doubt this man has put someone to death, and though he has got safely away from the sea, God will not let him go on living. 28:5 [hgb] 保 罗 竟 把 那 毒 蛇 ， 甩 在 火 里 ， 并 没 有 受 伤 。 [kjv] And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. [bbe] But shaking off the beast into the fire, he got no damage. 28:6 [hgb] 土 人 想 他 必 要 肿 起 来 ， 或 是 忽 然 仆 倒 死 了 。 看 了 多 时 ， 见 他 无 害 ， 就 转 念 说 ， 他 是 个 神 。 [kjv] Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. [bbe] But they had the idea that they would see him becoming ill, or suddenly falling down dead; but after waiting a long time, and seeing that no damage came to him, changing their opinion, they said he was a god. 28:7 [hgb] 离 那 地 方 不 远 ， 有 田 产 是 岛 长 部 百 流 的 。 他 接 纳 我 们 ， 尽 情 款 待 三 日 。 [kjv] In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. [bbe] Now near that place there was some land, the property of the chief man of the island, who was named Publius; who very kindly took us into his house as his guests for three days. 28:8 [hgb] 当 时 ， 部 百 流 的 父 亲 ， 患 热 病 和 痢 疾 躺 着 。 保 罗 进 去 ， 为 他 祷 告 ， 按 手 在 他 身 上 ， 治 好 了 他 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. [bbe] And the father of Publius was ill, with a disease of the stomach; to whom Paul went, and put his hands on him, with prayer, and made him well. 28:9 [hgb] 从 此 ， 岛 上 其 余 的 病 人 ， 也 来 得 了 医 治 。 [kjv] So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: [bbe] And when this took place, all the others in the island who had diseases came and were made well. 28:10 [hgb] 他 们 又 多 方 的 尊 敬 我 们 。 到 了 开 船 的 时 候 ， 也 把 我 们 所 需 用 的 送 到 船 上 。 [kjv] Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. [bbe] Then they gave us great honour, and, when we went away, they put into the ship whatever things we were in need of. 28:11 [hgb] 过 了 三 个 月 ， 我 们 上 了 亚 力 山 太 的 船 ， 往 前 行 。 这 船 以 丢 斯 双 子 为 记 ， 是 在 那 海 岛 过 了 冬 的 。 [kjv] And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. [bbe] And after three months we went to sea in a ship of Alexandria sailing under the sign of the Dioscuri, which had been at the island for the winter. 28:12 [hgb] 到 了 叙 拉 古 ， 我 们 停 泊 三 日 。 [kjv] And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. [bbe] And going into the harbour at Syracuse, we were waiting there for three days. 28:13 [hgb] 又 从 那 里 绕 行 ， 来 到 利 基 翁 。 过 了 一 天 ， 起 了 南 风 ， 第 二 天 就 来 到 部 丢 利 。 [kjv] And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: [bbe] And from there, going about in a curve, we came to Rhegium: and after one day a south wind came up and on the day after we came to Puteoli: 28:14 [hgb] 在 那 里 遇 见 弟 兄 们 ， 请 我 们 与 他 们 同 住 了 七 天 。 这 样 我 们 来 到 罗 马 。 [kjv] Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. [bbe] Where we came across some of the brothers, who kept us with them for seven days; and so we came to Rome. 28:15 [hgb] 那 里 的 弟 兄 们 ， 一 听 见 我 们 的 信 息 ， 就 出 来 到 亚 比 乌 市 ， 和 三 馆 地 方 迎 接 我 们 。 保 罗 见 了 他 们 ， 就 感 谢 神 ， 放 心 壮 胆 。 [kjv] And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. [bbe] And the brothers, when they had news of us, came out from town as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns to have a meeting with us: and Paul, seeing them, gave praise to God and took heart. 28:16 [hgb] 进 了 罗 马 城 ， （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 百 夫 长 把 众 囚 犯 交 给 御 营 的 统 领 惟 有 ） 保 罗 蒙 准 ， 和 一 个 看 守 他 的 兵 ， 另 住 在 一 处 。 [kjv] And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. [bbe] And when we came into Rome, they let Paul have a house for himself and the armed man who kept watch over him. 28:17 [hgb] 过 了 三 天 ， 保 罗 请 犹 太 人 的 首 领 来 。 他 们 来 了 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 弟 兄 们 ， 我 虽 没 有 作 什 么 事 干 犯 本 国 的 百 姓 ， 和 我 们 祖 宗 的 规 条 ， 却 被 锁 绑 ， 从 耶 路 撒 冷 解 在 罗 马 人 的 手 里 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. [bbe] Then after three days he sent for the chief men of the Jews: and when they had come together, he said to them, My brothers, though I had done nothing against the people or the ways of our fathers, I was given, a prisoner from Jerusalem, into the hands of the Romans. 28:18 [hgb] 他 们 审 问 了 我 ， 就 愿 意 释 放 我 。 因 为 在 我 身 上 ， 并 没 有 该 死 的 罪 。 [kjv] Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. [bbe] Who, when they had put questions to me, were ready to let me go free, because there was no cause of death in me. 28:19 [hgb] 无 奈 犹 太 人 不 服 ， 我 不 得 已 ， 只 好 上 告 于 该 撒 。 并 非 有 什 么 事 ， 要 控 告 我 本 国 的 百 姓 。 [kjv] But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. [bbe] But when the Jews made protest against it, I had to put my cause into Caesar\u0027s hands; not because I have anything to say against my nation. 28:20 [hgb] 因 此 ， 我 请 你 们 来 见 面 说 话 。 我 原 为 以 色 列 人 所 指 望 的 ， 被 这 链 子 捆 锁 。 [kjv] For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. [bbe] But for this reason I sent for you, to see and have talk with you: for because of the hope of Israel I am in these chains. 28:21 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 我 们 并 没 有 接 着 从 犹 太 来 论 你 的 信 ， 也 没 有 弟 兄 到 这 里 来 ， 报 给 我 们 说 ， 你 有 什 么 不 好 处 。 [kjv] And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. [bbe] And they said to him, We have not had letters from Judaea about you, and no one of the brothers has come to us here to give an account or say any evil about you. 28:22 [hgb] 但 我 们 愿 意 听 你 的 意 见 如 何 。 因 为 这 教 门 ， 我 们 晓 得 是 到 处 被 毁 谤 的 。 [kjv] But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. [bbe] But we have a desire to give hearing to your opinion: for as to this form of religion, we have knowledge that in all places it is attacked. 28:23 [hgb] 他 们 和 保 罗 约 定 了 日 子 ， 就 有 许 多 人 到 他 的 寓 处 来 ， 保 罗 从 早 到 晚 ， 对 他 们 讲 论 这 事 ， 证 明 神 国 的 道 ， 引 摩 西 的 律 法 和 先 知 的 书 ， 以 耶 稣 的 事 ， 劝 勉 他 们 。 [kjv] And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. [bbe] And when a day had been fixed, they came to his house in great numbers; and he gave them teaching, giving witness to the kingdom of God, and having discussions with them about Jesus, from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening. 28:24 [hgb] 他 所 说 的 话 ， 有 信 的 ， 有 不 信 的 。 [kjv] And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. [bbe] And some were in agreement with what he said, but some had doubts. 28:25 [hgb] 他 们 彼 此 不 合 ， 就 散 了 。 未 散 以 先 ， 保 罗 说 了 一 句 话 ， 说 ， 圣 灵 借 先 知 以 赛 亚 ， 向 你 们 祖 宗 所 说 的 话 ， 是 不 错 的 。 [kjv] And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, [bbe] And they went away, for there was a division among them after Paul had said this one thing: Well did the Holy Spirit say by the prophet Isaiah to your fathers, 28:26 [hgb] 他 说 ， 你 去 告 诉 这 百 姓 说 ， 你 们 听 是 要 听 见 ， 却 不 明 白 。 看 是 要 看 见 ， 却 不 晓 得 。 [kjv] Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: [bbe] Go to this people and say, Though you give ear, you will not get knowledge; and seeing, you will see, but the sense will not be clear to you: 28:27 [hgb] 因 为 这 百 姓 ， 油 蒙 了 心 ， 耳 朵 发 沉 ， 眼 睛 闭 着 。 恐 怕 眼 睛 看 见 ， 耳 朵 听 见 ， 心 里 明 白 ， 回 转 过 来 ， 我 就 医 治 他 们 。 [kjv] For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. [bbe] For the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut; for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me, so that I might make them well. 28:28 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 当 知 道 ， 神 这 救 恩 ， 如 今 传 给 外 邦 人 ， 他 们 也 必 听 受 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 ， [kjv] Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. [bbe] Be certain, then, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will give hearing. 28:29 [hgb] 保 罗 说 了 这 话 犹 太 人 议 论 纷 纷 的 就 走 了 ） 。 [kjv] And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. [bbe] [] 28:30 [hgb] 保 罗 在 自 己 所 租 的 房 子 里 ， 住 了 足 足 两 年 。 凡 来 见 他 的 人 ， 他 全 都 接 待 ， [kjv] And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, [bbe] And for the space of two years, Paul was living in the house of which he had the use, and had talk with all those who went in to see him, 28:31 [hgb] 放 胆 传 讲 神 国 的 道 ， 将 主 耶 稣 基 督 的 事 教 导 人 ， 并 没 有 人 禁 止 。 [kjv] Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him. [bbe] Preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ without fear, and no orders were given that he was not to do so.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2222.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
