{"id":2490,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"15:1 [hgb] 有 几 个 人 ， 从 犹 太 下 来 ， 教 训 弟 兄 们 说 ， 你 们 若 不 按 摩 西 的 规 条 受 割 礼 ， 不 能 得 救 。 [kjv] And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. [bbe] Now certain men came down from Judaea, teaching the brothers and saying that without circumcision, after the rule of Moses, there is no salvation. 15:2 [hgb] 保 罗 巴 拿 巴 与 他 们 大 大 地 分 争 辩 论 ， 众 门 徒 就 定 规 ， 叫 保 罗 ， 巴 拿 巴 和 本 会 中 几 个 人 ， 为 所 辩 论 的 ， 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 见 使 徒 和 长 老 。 [kjv] When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. [bbe] And after Paul and Barnabas had had no little argument and discussion with them, the brothers made a decision to send Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them to the Apostles and the rulers of the church at Jerusalem about this question. 15:3 [hgb] 于 是 教 会 送 他 们 起 行 ， 他 们 经 过 腓 尼 基 ， 撒 玛 利 亚 ， 随 处 传 说 外 邦 人 归 主 的 事 ， 叫 众 弟 兄 都 甚 欢 喜 。 [kjv] And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. [bbe] So they, being sent on their way by the church, went through Phoenicia and Samaria, giving news of the salvation of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the brothers. 15:4 [hgb] 到 了 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 教 会 和 使 徒 并 长 老 ， 都 接 待 他 们 ， 他 们 就 述 说 神 同 他 们 所 行 的 一 切 事 。 [kjv] And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. [bbe] And when they came to Jerusalem, they had a meeting with the church and the Apostles and the rulers, and they gave an account of all the things which God had done through them. 15:5 [hgb] 惟 有 几 个 信 徒 是 法 利 赛 教 门 的 人 ， 起 来 说 ， 必 须 给 外 邦 人 行 割 礼 ， 吩 咐 他 们 遵 守 摩 西 的 律 法 。 [kjv] But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. [bbe] But some of the Pharisees, who were of the faith, got up and said, It is necessary for these to have circumcision and to keep the law of Moses. 15:6 [hgb] 使 徒 和 长 老 ， 聚 会 商 议 这 事 。 [kjv] And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. [bbe] And the Apostles and the rulers of the church came together and gave thought to the question. 15:7 [hgb] 辩 论 已 经 多 了 ， 彼 得 就 起 来 ， 说 ， 诸 位 弟 兄 ， 你 们 知 道 神 早 已 在 你 们 中 间 拣 选 了 我 ， 叫 外 邦 人 从 我 口 中 得 听 福 音 之 道 ， 而 且 相 信 。 [kjv] And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. [bbe] And when there had been much discussion, Peter got up and said to them, My brothers, you have knowledge that some time back it was God\u0027s pleasure that by my mouth the good news might be given to the Gentiles so that they might have faith. 15:8 [hgb] 知 道 人 心 的 神 ， 也 为 他 们 作 了 见 证 。 赐 圣 灵 给 他 们 ， 正 如 给 我 们 一 样 。 [kjv] And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; [bbe] And God, the searcher of hearts, was a witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit even as he did to us; 15:9 [hgb] 又 借 着 信 ， 洁 净 了 他 们 的 心 ， 并 不 分 他 们 我 们 。 [kjv] And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. [bbe] Making no division between them and us, but making clean their hearts by faith. 15:10 [hgb] 现 在 为 什 么 试 探 神 ， 要 把 我 们 祖 宗 和 我 们 所 不 能 负 的 轭 ， 放 在 门 徒 的 颈 项 上 呢 ？ [kjv] Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? [bbe] Why then are you testing God, by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke so hard that not even our fathers or we were strong enough for it? 15:11 [hgb] 我 们 得 救 ， 乃 是 因 主 耶 稣 的 恩 ， 和 他 们 一 样 ， 这 是 我 们 所 信 的 。 [kjv] But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. [bbe] But we have faith that we will get salvation through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same way as they. 15:12 [hgb] 众 人 都 默 默 无 声 ， 听 巴 拿 巴 和 保 罗 ， 述 说 神 借 他 们 在 外 邦 人 中 所 行 的 神 迹 奇 事 。 [kjv] Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. [bbe] And all the people were quiet while Barnabas and Paul gave an account of the signs and wonders which God had done among the Gentiles by them. 15:13 [hgb] 他 们 住 了 声 ， 雅 各 就 说 ， 诸 位 弟 兄 ， 请 听 我 的 话 。 [kjv] And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: [bbe] And when they had come to an end, James, answering, said, My brothers, give ear to me: 15:14 [hgb] 方 才 西 门 述 说 神 当 初 怎 样 眷 顾 外 邦 人 ， 从 他 们 中 间 选 取 百 姓 归 于 自 己 的 名 下 [kjv] Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. [bbe] Symeon has given an account of how God was first pleased to take from among the Gentiles a people for himself. 15:15 [hgb] 众 先 知 的 话 ， 也 与 这 意 思 相 合 。 [kjv] And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, [bbe] And this is in agreement with the words of the prophets, as it is said, 15:16 [hgb] 正 如 经 上 所 写 的 ， 此 后 我 要 回 来 ， 重 新 修 造 大 卫 倒 塌 的 帐 幕 ， 把 那 破 坏 的 ， 重 新 修 造 建 立 起 来 。 [kjv] After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: [bbe] After these things I will come back, and will put up the tent of David which has been broken down, building up again its broken parts and making it complete: 15:17 [hgb] 叫 余 剩 的 人 ， 就 是 凡 称 为 我 名 下 的 外 邦 人 ， 都 寻 求 主 。 [kjv] That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. [bbe] So that the rest of men may make search for the Lord, and all the Gentiles on whom my name is named, 15:18 [hgb] 这 话 是 从 创 世 以 来 ， 显 明 这 事 的 主 说 的 。 [kjv] Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. [bbe] Says the Lord, who has made these things clear from the earliest times. 15:19 [hgb] 所 以 据 我 的 意 见 ， 不 可 难 为 那 归 服 神 的 外 邦 人 。 [kjv] Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: [bbe] For this reason my decision is, that we do not put trouble in the way of those who from among the Gentiles are turned to God; 15:20 [hgb] 只 要 写 信 ， 吩 咐 他 们 禁 戒 偶 像 的 污 秽 和 奸 淫 ， 并 勒 死 的 牲 畜 ， 和 血 。 [kjv] But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. [bbe] But that we give them orders to keep themselves from things offered to false gods, and from the evil desires of the body, and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law, and from blood. 15:21 [hgb] 因 为 从 古 以 来 ， 摩 西 的 书 在 各 城 有 人 传 讲 ， 每 逢 安 息 日 ， 在 会 堂 里 诵 读 。 [kjv] For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. [bbe] For Moses, from times long past, has his preachers in every town, reading his law in the Synagogues every Sabbath. 15:22 [hgb] 那 时 ， 使 徒 和 长 老 并 全 教 会 ， 定 意 从 他 们 中 间 拣 选 人 ， 差 他 们 和 保 罗 ， 巴 拿 巴 ， 同 往 安 提 阿 去 。 所 拣 选 的 ， 就 是 称 呼 巴 撒 巴 的 犹 大 ， 和 西 拉 ， 这 两 个 人 在 弟 兄 中 是 作 首 领 的 。 [kjv] Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: [bbe] Then it seemed good to the Apostles and the rulers and all the church, to send men from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas, named Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers: 15:23 [hgb] 于 是 写 信 交 付 他 们 ， 内 中 说 ， 使 徒 和 作 长 老 的 弟 兄 们 ， 问 安 提 阿 ， 叙 利 亚 ， 基 利 家 外 邦 众 弟 兄 的 安 。 [kjv] And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: [bbe] And they sent a letter by them, saying, The Apostles and the older brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, may joy be with you: 15:24 [hgb] 我 们 听 说 有 几 个 人 ， 从 我 们 这 里 出 去 ， 用 言 语 搅 扰 你 们 ， 惑 乱 你 们 的 心 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 你 们 必 须 受 割 礼 守 摩 西 的 律 法 ） 。 其 实 我 们 并 没 有 吩 咐 他 们 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment: [bbe] Because we have knowledge that some who went from us have been troubling you with their words, putting your souls in doubt; to whom we gave no such order; 15:25 [hgb] 所 以 我 们 同 心 定 意 ， 拣 选 几 个 人 ， 差 他 们 同 我 们 所 亲 爱 的 巴 拿 巴 ， 和 保 罗 ， 往 你 们 那 里 去 。 [kjv] It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, [bbe] It seemed good to us, having come to an agreement together, to send these men to you, with our well loved Barnabas and Paul, 15:26 [hgb] 这 二 人 是 为 我 主 耶 稣 基 督 的 名 ， 不 顾 性 命 的 。 [kjv] Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. [bbe] Men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 15:27 [hgb] 我 们 就 差 了 犹 大 和 西 拉 ， 他 们 也 要 亲 口 诉 说 这 些 事 。 [kjv] We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. [bbe] And so we have sent Judas and Silas, who will say the same things to you themselves, by word of mouth. 15:28 [hgb] 因 为 圣 灵 和 我 们 ， 定 意 不 将 别 的 重 担 放 在 你 们 身 上 。 惟 有 几 件 事 是 不 可 少 的 ， [kjv] For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; [bbe] For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, to put on you nothing more than these necessary things; 15:29 [hgb] 就 是 禁 戒 祭 偶 像 的 物 ， 和 血 ， 并 勒 死 的 牲 畜 ， 和 奸 淫 。 这 几 件 你 们 若 能 自 己 禁 戒 不 犯 ， 就 好 了 。 愿 你 们 平 安 。 [kjv] That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. [bbe] To keep from things offered to false gods, and from blood, and from things put to death in ways which are against the law, and from the evil desires of the body; if you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. May you be happy. 15:30 [hgb] 他 们 既 奉 了 差 遣 ， 就 下 安 提 阿 去 ， 聚 集 众 人 ， 交 付 书 信 。 [kjv] So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: [bbe] So they, being sent away, came down to Antioch, and having got the people together, they gave them the letter. 15:31 [hgb] 众 人 念 了 ， 因 为 信 上 安 慰 的 话 ， 就 欢 喜 了 。 [kjv] Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. [bbe] And after reading it, they were glad of its comfort. 15:32 [hgb] 犹 大 和 西 拉 也 是 先 知 ， 就 用 许 多 话 劝 勉 弟 兄 ， 坚 固 他 们 。 [kjv] And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. [bbe] And Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, gave teaching to the brothers and made them strong in the faith. 15:33 [hgb] 住 了 些 日 子 ， 弟 兄 们 打 发 他 们 平 平 安 安 地 回 到 差 遣 他 们 的 人 那 里 去 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 [kjv] And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. [bbe] And when they had been there for some time, they were sent back in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. 15:34 [hgb] 惟 有 西 拉 定 意 仍 住 在 那 里 。 ） [kjv] Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. [bbe] [] 15:35 [hgb] 但 保 罗 和 巴 拿 巴 ， 仍 住 在 安 提 阿 ， 和 许 多 别 人 一 同 教 训 人 ， 传 主 的 道 。 [kjv] Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. [bbe] But Paul and Barnabas kept on in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of God, with a number of others. 15:36 [hgb] 过 了 些 日 子 ， 保 罗 对 巴 拿 巴 说 ， 我 们 可 以 回 到 从 前 宣 传 主 道 的 各 城 ， 看 望 弟 兄 们 景 况 如 何 。 [kjv] And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do. [bbe] And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go back and see the brothers in every town where we have given the word of God, and see how they are. 15:37 [hgb] 巴 拿 巴 有 意 ， 要 带 称 呼 马 可 的 约 翰 同 去 。 [kjv] And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. [bbe] And Barnabas had a desire to take with them John, named Mark. 15:38 [hgb] 但 保 罗 ， 因 为 马 可 从 前 在 旁 非 利 亚 离 开 他 们 ， 不 和 他 们 同 去 作 工 ， 就 以 为 不 可 带 他 去 。 [kjv] But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. [bbe] But Paul was of the opinion that it was not right to take with them one who had gone away from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with the work. 15:39 [hgb] 于 是 二 人 起 了 争 论 ， 甚 至 彼 此 分 开 。 巴 拿 巴 带 着 马 可 ， 坐 船 往 居 比 路 去 。 [kjv] And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; [bbe] And there was a sharp argument between them, so that they were parted from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and went by ship to Cyprus; 15:40 [hgb] 保 罗 拣 选 了 西 拉 ， 也 出 去 ， 蒙 弟 兄 们 把 他 交 于 主 的 恩 中 。 [kjv] And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. [bbe] But Paul took Silas and went away with the blessing of the brothers. 15:41 [hgb] 他 就 走 遍 叙 利 亚 ， 基 利 家 ， 坚 固 众 教 会 。 [kjv] And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. [bbe] And he went through Syria and Cilicia, making the churches stronger in the faith.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2209.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
