And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. \n [bbe] And when he had been there three months, because the Jews had made a secret design against him when he was about to take ship for Syria, he made a decision to go back through Macedonia. \n 20:4 [hgb] 同 他 到 亚 西 亚 去 的 ， 有 庇 哩 亚 人 毕 罗 斯 的 儿 子 所 巴 特 ， 帖 撒 罗 尼 迦 人 亚 里 达 古 ， 和 西 公 都 ， 还 有 特 庇 人 该 犹 ， 并 提 摩 太 ， 又 有 亚 西 亚 人 推 基 古 ， 和 特 罗 非 摩 。 \n [kjv] And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. \n [bbe] And Sopater of Beroea, the son of Pyrrhus, and Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia, went with him as far as Asia. \n 20:5 [hgb] 这 些 人 先 走 在 特 罗 亚 等 候 我 们 。 \n [kjv] These going before tarried for us at Troas. \n [bbe] But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas. \n 20:6 [hgb] 过 了 除 酵 的 日 子 ， 我 们 从 腓 立 比 开 船 ， 五 天 到 了 特 罗 亚 ， 和 他 们 相 会 ， 在 那 里 住 了 七 天 。 \n [kjv] And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days. \n [bbe] And we went away from Philippi by ship after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days; and we were there for seven days. \n 20:7 [hgb] 七 日 的 第 一 日 ， 我 们 聚 会 掰 饼 的 时 候 ， 保 罗 因 为 要 次 日 起 行 ， 就 与 他 们 讲 论 ， 直 讲 到 半 夜 。 \n [kjv] And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. \n [bbe] And on the first day of the week, when we had come together for the holy meal, Paul gave them a talk, for it was his purpose to go away on the day after; and he went on talking till after the middle of the night. \n 20:8 [hgb] 我 们 聚 会 的 那 座 楼 上 ， 有 好 些 灯 烛 。 \n [kjv] And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. \n [bbe] And there were a number of lights in the room where we had come together. \n 20:9 [hgb] 有 一 个 少 年 人 ， 名 叫 犹 推 古 ， 坐 在 窗 台 上 ， 困 倦 沉 睡 。 保 罗 讲 了 多 时 ， 少 年 人 睡 熟 了 ， 就 从 三 层 楼 上 掉 下 去 。 扶 起 他 来 ， 已 经 死 了 。 \n [kjv] And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. \n [bbe] And a certain young man named Eutychus, who was seated in the window, went into a deep sleep; and while Paul went on talking, being overcome by sleep, he had a fall from the third floor, and was taken up dead. \n 20:10 [hgb] 保 罗 下 去 ， 伏 在 他 身 上 ， 抱 着 他 ， 说 ， 你 们 不 要 发 慌 ， 他 的 灵 魂 还 在 身 上 。 \n [kjv] And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. \n [bbe] And Paul went down and, falling on him, took him in his arms and said, Do not be troubled, for his life is in him. \n 20:11 [hgb] 保 罗 又 上 去 ， 掰 饼 ， 吃 了 ， 谈 论 许 久 ， 直 到 天 亮 ， 这 才 走 了 。 \n [kjv] When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. \n [bbe] And when he had gone up, and had taken the broken bread, he went on talking to them for a long time, even till dawn, and then he went away. \n 20:12 [hgb] 有 人 把 那 童 子 活 活 地 领 来 ， 得 的 安 慰 不 小 。 \n [kjv] And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted. \n [bbe] And they took the boy in, living, and were greatly comforted. \n 20:13 [hgb] 我 们 先 上 船 开 往 亚 朔 去 ， 意 思 要 在 那 里 接 保 罗 。 因 为 他 是 这 样 安 排 的 ， 他 自 己 打 算 要 步 行 。 \n [kjv] And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot. \n [bbe] But we, going before him by ship, went to Assos with the purpose of taking Paul in there: for so he had given orders, because he himself was coming by land. \n 20:14 [hgb] 他 既 在 亚 朔 与 我 们 相 会 ， 我 们 就 接 他 上 船 ， 来 到 米 推 利 尼 。 \n [kjv] And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene. \n [bbe] And when he came up with us at Assos, we took him in the ship and went on to Mitylene. \n 20:15 [hgb] 从 那 里 开 船 ， 次 日 到 了 基 阿 的 对 面 。 又 次 日 ， 在 撒 摩 靠 岸 。 又 次 日 ， 来 到 米 利 都 。 \n [kjv] And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus. \n [bbe] And going from there by sea, we came on the day after opposite Chios, and touching at Samos on the day after that, we came on the third day to Miletus. \n 20:16 [hgb] 乃 因 保 罗 早 已 定 意 越 过 以 弗 所 ， 免 得 在 亚 西 亚 耽 延 。 他 急 忙 前 走 ， 巴 不 得 赶 五 旬 节 能 到 耶 路 撒 冷 。 \n [kjv] For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. \n [bbe] For Paul\u0027s purpose was to go past Ephesus, so that he might not be kept in Asia; for he was going quickly, in order, if possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. \n 20:17 [hgb] 保 罗 从 米 利 都 打 发 人 往 以 弗 所 去 ， 请 教 会 的 长 老 来 。 \n [kjv] And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. \n [bbe] And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the rulers of the church. \n 20:18 [hgb] 他 们 来 了 ， 保 罗 就 说 ， 你 们 知 道 ， 自 从 我 到 亚 西 亚 的 日 子 以 来 ， 在 你 们 中 间 始 终 为 人 如 何 ， \n [kjv] And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, \n [bbe] And when they had come, he said to them, You yourselves have seen what my life has been like all the time from the day when I first came into Asia, \n 20:19 [hgb] 服 事 主 ， 凡 事 谦 卑 ， 眼 中 流 泪 ， 又 因 犹 太 人 的 谋 害 ， 经 历 试 炼 。 \n [kjv] Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: \n [bbe] Doing the Lord\u0027s work without pride, through all the sorrow and troubles which came on me because of the evil designs of the Jews: \n 20:20 [hgb] 你 们 也 知 道 ， 凡 与 你 们 有 益 的 ， 我 没 有 一 样 避 讳 不 说 的 。 或 在 众 人 面 前 ， 或 在 各 人 家 里 ， 我 都 教 导 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, \n [bbe] And how I kept back nothing which might be of profit to you, teaching you publicly and privately, \n 20:21 [hgb] 又 对 犹 太 人 ， 和 希 利 尼 人 ， 证 明 当 向 神 悔 改 ， 信 靠 我 主 耶 稣 基 督 。 \n [kjv] Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. \n [bbe] Preaching to Jews and to Greeks the need for a turning of the heart to God, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. \n 20:22 [hgb] 现 在 我 往 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 心 甚 迫 切 ， （ 原 文 作 心 被 捆 绑 ） 不 知 道 在 那 里 要 遇 见 什 么 事 。 \n [kjv] And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: \n [bbe] And now, as you see, I am going to Jerusalem, a prisoner in spirit, having no knowledge of what will come to me there: \n 20:23 [hgb] 但 知 道 圣 灵 在 各 城 里 向 我 指 证 ， 说 ， 有 捆 锁 与 患 难 等 待 我 。 \n [kjv] Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. \n [bbe] Only that the Holy Spirit makes clear to me in every town that prison and pains are waiting for me. \n 20:24 [hgb] 我 却 不 以 性 命 为 念 ， 也 不 看 为 宝 贵 ， 只 要 行 完 我 的 路 程 ， 成 就 我 从 主 耶 稣 所 领 受 的 职 事 ， 证 明 神 恩 惠 的 福 音 。 \n [kjv] But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. \n [bbe] But I put no value on my life, if only at the end of it I may see the work complete which was given to me by the Lord Jesus, to be a witness of the good news of the grace of God. \n 20:25 [hgb] 我 素 常 在 你 们 中 间 来 往 ， 传 讲 神 国 的 道 ， 如 今 我 晓 得 你 们 以 后 都 不 得 再 见 我 的 面 了 。 \n [kjv] And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. \n [bbe] And now I am conscious that you, among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom, will not see my face again. \n 20:26 [hgb] 所 以 我 今 日 向 你 们 证 明 ， 你 们 中 间 无 论 何 人 死 亡 ， 罪 不 在 我 身 上 。 （ 原 文 作 我 于 众 人 的 血 是 洁 净 的 ） 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. \n [bbe] And so I say to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men. \n 20:27 [hgb] 因 为 神 的 旨 意 ， 我 并 没 有 一 样 避 讳 不 传 给 你 们 的 。 \n [kjv] For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. \n [bbe] For I have not kept back from you anything of the purpose of God. \n 20:28 [hgb] 圣 灵 立 你 们 作 全 群 的 监 督 ， 你 们 就 当 为 自 己 谨 慎 ， 也 为 全 群 谨 慎 ， 牧 养 神 的 教 会 ， 就 是 他 用 自 己 血 所 买 来 的 （ 或 作 救 赎 的 ） 。 \n [kjv] Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. \n [bbe] Give attention to yourselves, and to all the flock which the Holy Spirit has given into your care, to give food to the church of God, for which he gave his blood. \n 20:29 [hgb] 我 知 道 我 去 之 后 ， 必 有 凶 暴 的 豺 狼 ， 进 入 你 们 中 间 ， 不 爱 惜 羊 群 。 \n [kjv] For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. \n [bbe] I am conscious that after I am gone, evil wolves will come in among you, doing damage to the flock; \n 20:30 [hgb] 就 是 你 们 中 间 ， 也 必 有 人 起 来 ， 说 悖 谬 的 话 ， 要 引 诱 门 徒 跟 从 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. \n [bbe] And from among yourselves will come men who will give wrong teaching, turning away the disciples after them. \n 20:31 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 应 当 儆 醒 ， 记 念 我 三 年 之 久 ， 昼 夜 不 住 地 流 泪 ， 劝 戒 你 们 各 人 。 \n [kjv] Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. \n [bbe] So keep watch, having in mind that for three years without resting I was teaching every one of you, day and night, with weeping. \n 20:32 [hgb] 如 今 我 把 你 们 交 托 神 ， 和 他 恩 惠 的 道 。 这 道 能 建 立 你 们 ， 叫 你 们 和 一 切 成 圣 的 人 同 得 基 业 。 \n [kjv] And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. \n [bbe] And now, I give you into the care of God and the word of his grace, which is able to make you strong and to give you your heritage among all the saints. \n 20:33 [hgb] 我 未 曾 贪 图 一 个 人 的 金 ， 银 ， 衣 服 。 \n [kjv] I have coveted no man\u0027s silver, or gold, or apparel. \n [bbe] I have had no desire for any man\u0027s silver or gold or clothing. \n 20:34 [hgb] 我 这 两 只 手 ， 常 供 给 我 和 同 人 的 需 用 ， 这 是 你 们 自 己 知 道 的 。 \n [kjv] Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. \n [bbe] You yourselves have seen that with these hands I got what was necessary for me and those who were with me. \n 20:35 [hgb] 我 凡 事 给 你 们 作 榜 样 ， 叫 你 们 知 道 ， 应 当 这 样 劳 苦 ， 扶 助 软 弱 的 人 ， 又 当 记 念 主 耶 稣 的 话 ， 说 ， 施 比 受 更 为 有 福 。 \n [kjv] I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. \n [bbe] In all things I was an example to you of how, in your lives, you are to give help to the feeble, and keep in memory the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, There is a greater blessing in giving than in getting. \n 20:36 [hgb] 保 罗 说 完 了 这 话 ， 就 跪 下 同 众 人 祷 告 。 \n [kjv] And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. \n [bbe] And having said these words, he went down on his knees in prayer with them all. \n 20:37 [hgb] 众 人 痛 哭 ， 抱 着 保 罗 的 颈 项 ， 和 他 亲 嘴 。 \n [kjv] And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul\u0027s neck, and kissed him, \n [bbe] And they were all weeping, falling on Paul\u0027s neck and kissing him, \n 20:38 [hgb] 叫 他 们 最 伤 心 的 ， 就 是 他 说 ， 以 后 不 能 再 见 我 的 面 那 句 话 。 于 是 送 他 上 船 去 了 。 \n [kjv] Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship. \n [bbe] Being sad most of all because he had said that they would not see his face again. And so they went with him to the ship. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2214.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
