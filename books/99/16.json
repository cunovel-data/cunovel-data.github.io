{"id":2491,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"16:1 [hgb] 保 罗 来 到 特 庇 ， 又 到 路 司 得 。 在 那 里 有 一 个 门 徒 ， 名 叫 提 摩 太 ， 是 信 主 之 犹 太 妇 人 的 儿 子 ， 他 父 亲 却 是 希 利 尼 人 。 \n [kjv] Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: \n [bbe] And he came to Derbe and Lystra: and there was a certain disciple there named Timothy, whose mother was one of the Jews of the faith, but his father was a Greek; \n 16:2 [hgb] 路 司 得 和 以 哥 念 的 弟 兄 ， 都 称 赞 他 。 \n [kjv] Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. \n [bbe] Of whom the brothers at Lystra and Iconium had a high opinion. \n 16:3 [hgb] 保 罗 要 带 他 同 去 ， 只 因 那 些 地 方 的 犹 太 人 ， 都 知 道 他 父 亲 是 希 利 尼 人 ， 就 给 他 行 了 割 礼 。 \n [kjv] Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek. \n [bbe] Paul had a desire for him to go with him, and he gave him circumcision because of the Jews who were in those parts: for they all had knowledge that his father was a Greek. \n 16:4 [hgb] 他 们 经 过 各 城 ， 把 耶 路 撒 冷 使 徒 和 长 老 所 定 的 条 规 ， 交 给 门 徒 遵 守 。 \n [kjv] And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. \n [bbe] And on their way through the towns, they gave them the rules which had been made by the Apostles and the rulers of the church at Jerusalem, so that they might keep them. \n 16:5 [hgb] 于 是 众 教 会 信 心 越 发 坚 固 ， 人 数 天 天 加 增 。 \n [kjv] And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily. \n [bbe] So the churches were made strong in the faith and were increased in number every day. \n 16:6 [hgb] 圣 灵 既 然 禁 止 他 们 在 亚 西 亚 讲 道 ， 他 们 就 经 过 弗 吕 家 ， 加 拉 太 一 带 地 方 。 \n [kjv] Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, \n [bbe] And after they had gone through the land of Phrygia and Galatia, the Holy Spirit did not let them take the word into Asia; \n 16:7 [hgb] 到 了 每 西 亚 的 边 界 ， 他 们 想 要 往 庇 推 尼 去 ， 耶 稣 的 灵 却 不 许 。 \n [kjv] After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not. \n [bbe] And having come to Mysia, they made an attempt to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them; \n 16:8 [hgb] 他 们 就 越 过 每 西 亚 ， 下 到 特 罗 亚 去 。 \n [kjv] And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. \n [bbe] And going past Mysia, they came down to Troas. \n 16:9 [hgb] 在 夜 间 有 异 象 现 与 保 罗 。 有 一 个 马 其 顿 人 ， 站 着 求 他 说 ， 请 你 过 到 马 其 顿 来 帮 助 我 们 。 \n [kjv] And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. \n [bbe] And Paul had a vision in the night; a man of Macedonia came, requesting him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia and give us help. \n 16:10 [hgb] 保 罗 既 看 见 这 异 象 ， 我 们 随 即 想 要 往 马 其 顿 去 ， 以 为 神 召 我 们 传 福 音 给 那 里 的 人 听 。 \n [kjv] And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them. \n [bbe] And when he had seen the vision, straight away we made the decision to go into Macedonia, for it seemed certain to us that God had sent us to give the good news to them. \n 16:11 [hgb] 于 是 从 特 罗 亚 开 船 ， 一 直 行 到 撒 摩 特 喇 ， 第 二 天 到 了 尼 亚 波 利 。 \n [kjv] Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; \n [bbe] So, from Troas we went straight by ship to Samothrace and the day after to Neapolis; \n 16:12 [hgb] 从 那 里 来 到 腓 立 比 ， 就 是 马 其 顿 这 一 方 的 头 一 个 城 。 也 是 罗 马 的 驻 防 城 。 我 们 在 这 城 里 住 了 几 天 。 \n [kjv] And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. \n [bbe] And from there to Philippi, which is the most important town of Macedonia and a Roman colony: and we were there for some days. \n 16:13 [hgb] 当 安 息 日 ， 我 们 出 城 门 ， 到 了 河 边 ， 知 道 那 里 有 一 个 祷 告 的 地 方 ， 我 们 就 坐 下 对 那 聚 会 的 妇 女 讲 道 。 \n [kjv] And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither. \n [bbe] And on the Sabbath we went outside the town, by the river, where we had an idea that there would be a place of prayer; and, being seated, we had talk with the women who had come together. \n 16:14 [hgb] 有 一 个 卖 紫 色 布 疋 的 妇 人 ， 名 叫 吕 底 亚 ， 是 推 雅 推 喇 城 的 人 ， 素 来 敬 拜 神 。 她 听 见 了 ， 主 就 开 导 她 的 心 ， 叫 她 留 心 听 保 罗 所 讲 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. \n [bbe] And a certain woman named Lydia, a trader in purple cloth of the town of Thyatira, and a God-fearing woman, gave ear to us: whose heart the Lord made open to give attention to the things which Paul was saying. \n 16:15 [hgb] 她 和 她 一 家 ， 既 领 了 洗 ， 便 求 我 们 说 ， 你 们 若 以 为 我 是 真 信 主 的 ， （ 或 作 你 们 若 以 为 我 是 忠 心 事 主 的 ） 请 到 我 家 里 来 住 。 于 是 强 留 我 们 。 \n [kjv] And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. \n [bbe] And when she and her family had had baptism, she made a request to us, saying, If it seems to you that I am true to the Lord, come into my house and be my guests. And she made us come. \n 16:16 [hgb] 后 来 ， 我 们 往 那 祷 告 的 地 方 去 。 有 一 个 使 女 迎 着 面 来 ， 她 被 巫 鬼 所 附 ， 用 法 术 ， 叫 她 主 人 们 大 得 财 利 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: \n [bbe] And when we were going to the place of prayer, we came across a girl with a spirit which gave knowledge of the future, whose masters made great profit from her power. \n 16:17 [hgb] 她 跟 随 保 罗 和 我 们 ， 喊 着 说 ， 这 些 人 是 至 高 神 的 仆 人 ， 对 你 们 传 说 救 人 的 道 。 \n [kjv] The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. \n [bbe] She came after Paul and us, crying out and saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who are giving you news of the way of salvation. \n 16:18 [hgb] 她 一 连 多 日 这 样 喊 叫 ， 保 罗 就 心 中 厌 烦 ， 转 身 对 那 鬼 说 ， 我 奉 耶 稣 基 督 的 名 ， 吩 咐 你 从 她 身 上 出 来 。 那 鬼 当 时 就 出 来 了 。 \n [kjv] And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. \n [bbe] And this she did on a number of days. But Paul was greatly troubled and, turning, said to the spirit, I give you orders in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her. And it came out that very hour. \n 16:19 [hgb] 使 女 的 主 人 们 ， 见 得 利 的 指 望 没 有 了 ， 便 揪 住 保 罗 和 西 拉 ， 拉 他 们 到 市 上 去 见 首 领 。 \n [kjv] And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers, \n [bbe] But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they took Paul and Silas, pulling them into the market-place before the rulers; \n 16:20 [hgb] 又 带 到 官 长 面 前 说 ， 这 些 人 原 是 犹 太 人 ， 竟 骚 扰 我 们 的 城 ， \n [kjv] And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, \n [bbe] And when they had taken them before the authorities, they said, These men, who are Jews, are greatly troubling our town; \n 16:21 [hgb] 传 我 们 罗 马 人 所 不 可 受 ， 不 可 行 的 规 矩 。 \n [kjv] And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans. \n [bbe] Teaching rules of living which it is not right for us to have or to keep, being Romans. \n 16:22 [hgb] 众 人 就 一 同 起 来 攻 击 他 们 。 官 长 吩 咐 剥 了 他 们 的 衣 裳 ， 用 棍 打 。 \n [kjv] And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them. \n [bbe] And the people made an attack on them all together: and the authorities took their clothing off them, and gave orders for them to be whipped. \n 16:23 [hgb] 打 了 许 多 棍 ， 便 将 他 们 下 在 监 里 ， 嘱 咐 禁 卒 严 紧 看 守 。 \n [kjv] And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: \n [bbe] And when they had given them a great number of blows, they put them in prison, giving orders to the keeper of the prison to keep them safely: \n 16:24 [hgb] 禁 卒 领 了 这 样 的 命 ， 就 把 他 们 下 在 内 监 里 ， 两 脚 上 了 木 狗 。 \n [kjv] Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. \n [bbe] And he, having such orders, put them into the inner prison with chains on their feet. \n 16:25 [hgb] 约 在 半 夜 ， 保 罗 和 西 拉 ， 祷 告 唱 诗 赞 美 神 ， 众 囚 犯 也 侧 耳 而 听 。 \n [kjv] And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. \n [bbe] But about the middle of the night, Paul and Silas were making prayers and songs to God in the hearing of the prisoners; \n 16:26 [hgb] 忽 然 地 大 震 动 ， 甚 至 监 牢 的 地 基 都 摇 动 了 。 监 门 立 刻 全 开 ， 众 囚 犯 的 锁 链 也 都 松 开 了 。 \n [kjv] And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one\u0027s bands were loosed. \n [bbe] And suddenly there was an earth-shock, so that the base of the prison was moved: and all the doors came open, and everyone\u0027s chains came off. \n 16:27 [hgb] 禁 卒 一 醒 ， 看 见 监 门 全 开 ， 以 为 囚 犯 已 经 逃 走 ， 就 拔 刀 要 自 杀 。 \n [kjv] And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. \n [bbe] And the keeper, coming out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, took his sword and was about to put himself to death, fearing that the prisoners had got away. \n 16:28 [hgb] 保 罗 大 声 呼 叫 说 ， 不 要 伤 害 自 己 ， 我 们 都 在 这 里 。 \n [kjv] But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. \n [bbe] But Paul said in a loud voice, Do yourself no damage, for we are all here. \n 16:29 [hgb] 禁 卒 叫 人 拿 灯 来 ， 就 跳 进 去 ， 战 战 兢 兢 地 俯 伏 在 保 罗 西 拉 面 前 。 \n [kjv] Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, \n [bbe] And he sent for lights and came rushing in and, shaking with fear, went down on his face before Paul and Silas, \n 16:30 [hgb] 又 领 他 们 出 来 说 ， 二 位 先 生 ， 我 当 怎 样 行 才 可 以 得 救 ？ \n [kjv] And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? \n [bbe] And took them out and said, Sirs, what have I to do to get salvation? \n 16:31 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 当 信 主 耶 稣 ， 你 和 你 一 家 都 必 得 救 。 \n [kjv] And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. \n [bbe] And they said, Have faith in the Lord Jesus, and you and your family will have salvation. \n 16:32 [hgb] 他 们 就 把 主 的 道 ， 讲 给 他 和 他 全 家 的 人 听 。 \n [kjv] And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. \n [bbe] And they gave the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. \n 16:33 [hgb] 当 夜 就 在 那 时 候 ， 禁 卒 把 他 们 带 去 ， 洗 他 们 的 伤 。 他 和 属 乎 他 的 人 ， 立 时 都 受 了 洗 。 \n [kjv] And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. \n [bbe] And that same hour of the night, he took them, and when he had given attention to their wounds, he and all his family had baptism straight away. \n 16:34 [hgb] 于 是 禁 卒 领 他 们 上 自 己 家 里 去 ， 给 他 们 摆 上 饭 ， 他 和 全 家 ， 因 为 信 了 神 ， 都 很 喜 乐 。 \n [kjv] And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. \n [bbe] And he took them into his house and gave them food, and he was full of joy, having faith in God with all his family. \n 16:35 [hgb] 到 了 天 亮 ， 官 长 打 发 差 役 来 说 ， 释 放 那 两 个 人 吧 。 \n [kjv] And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go. \n [bbe] But when it was day, the authorities sent the police, saying, Let these men go. \n 16:36 [hgb] 禁 卒 就 把 这 话 告 诉 保 罗 说 ， 官 长 打 发 人 来 叫 释 放 你 们 。 如 今 可 以 出 监 ， 平 平 安 安 地 去 吧 。 \n [kjv] And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace. \n [bbe] And the keeper said to Paul, The authorities have given orders to let you go: come out now, and go in peace. \n 16:37 [hgb] 保 罗 却 说 ， 我 们 是 罗 马 人 ， 并 没 有 定 罪 ， 他 们 就 在 众 人 面 前 打 了 我 们 ， 又 把 我 们 下 在 监 里 。 现 在 要 私 下 撵 我 们 出 去 吗 ？ 这 是 不 行 的 。 叫 他 们 自 己 来 领 我 们 出 去 吧 。 \n [kjv] But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out. \n [bbe] But Paul said to them, They have given us who are Romans a public whipping without judging us, and have put us in prison. Will they now send us out secretly? no, truly, let them come themselves and take us out. \n 16:38 [hgb] 差 役 把 这 话 回 禀 官 长 。 官 长 听 见 他 们 是 罗 马 人 ， 就 害 怕 了 。 \n [kjv] And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. \n [bbe] And the police gave an account of these words to the authorities, and they were full of fear on hearing that they were Romans; \n 16:39 [hgb] 于 是 来 劝 他 们 ， 领 他 们 出 来 ， 请 他 们 离 开 那 城 。 \n [kjv] And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city. \n [bbe] Then they came and made prayers to them, requesting them, when they had taken them out, to go away from the town. \n 16:40 [hgb] 二 人 出 了 监 ， 往 吕 底 亚 家 里 去 。 见 了 弟 兄 们 ， 劝 慰 他 们 一 番 ， 就 走 了 。 \n [kjv] And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed. \n [bbe] And they came out of the prison and went to the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers they gave them comfort and went away. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2210.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
