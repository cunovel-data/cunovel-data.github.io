{"id":2487,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"12:1 [hgb] 那 时 ， 希 律 王 下 手 苦 害 教 会 中 几 个 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. \\n\\n [bbe] Now, about that time, Herod the king made cruel attacks on the Christians. \\n\\n 12:2 [hgb] 用 刀 杀 了 约 翰 的 哥 哥 雅 各 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. \\n\\n [bbe] And he put James, the brother of John, to death with the sword. \\n\\n 12:3 [hgb] 他 见 犹 太 人 喜 欢 这 事 ， 又 去 捉 拿 彼 得 。 那 时 正 是 除 酵 的 日 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) \\n\\n [bbe] And when he saw that this was pleasing to the Jews he went on to take Peter in addition. This was at the time of the feast of unleavened bread. \\n\\n 12:4 [hgb] 希 律 拿 了 彼 得 收 在 监 里 ， 交 付 四 班 兵 丁 看 守 ， 每 班 四 个 人 ， 意 思 要 在 逾 越 节 后 ， 把 他 提 出 来 ， 当 着 百 姓 办 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. \\n\\n [bbe] And having taken him, he put him in prison, with four bands of armed men to keep watch over him; his purpose being to take him out to the people after the Passover. \\n\\n 12:5 [hgb] 于 是 彼 得 被 囚 在 监 里 。 教 会 却 为 他 切 切 地 祷 告 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. \\n\\n [bbe] So Peter was kept in prison: but the church made strong prayer to God for him. \\n\\n 12:6 [hgb] 希 律 将 要 提 他 出 来 的 前 一 夜 ， 彼 得 被 两 条 铁 链 锁 着 ， 睡 在 两 个 兵 丁 当 中 。 看 守 的 人 也 在 门 外 看 守 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Herod was about to take him out, the same night Peter was sleeping in chains between two armed men, and the watchmen were keeping watch before the door of the prison. \\n\\n 12:7 [hgb] 忽 然 有 主 的 一 个 使 者 ， 站 在 旁 边 ， 屋 里 有 光 照 耀 。 天 使 拍 彼 得 的 肋 旁 ， 拍 醒 了 他 ， 说 ， 快 快 起 来 。 那 铁 链 就 从 他 手 上 脱 落 下 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. \\n\\n [bbe] And a great light was seen shining in the room, and an angel of the Lord came to Peter and, touching him on his side so that he came out of his sleep, said, Get up quickly. And his chains came off his hands. \\n\\n 12:8 [hgb] 天 使 对 他 说 ， 束 上 带 子 。 穿 上 鞋 。 他 就 那 样 作 。 天 使 又 说 ， 披 上 外 衣 跟 着 我 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the angel said, Put on your shoes and get ready to go. And he did so. And he said, Put your coat round you and come with me. \\n\\n 12:9 [hgb] 彼 得 就 出 来 跟 着 他 ， 不 知 道 天 使 所 作 是 真 的 ， 只 当 见 了 异 象 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. \\n\\n [bbe] And he went out after him; and he was not certain if what was done by the angel was a fact, for it seemed to him that he was seeing a vision. \\n\\n 12:10 [hgb] 过 了 第 一 层 ， 第 二 层 监 牢 ， 就 来 到 临 街 的 铁 门 。 那 门 自 己 开 了 。 他 们 出 来 ， 走 过 一 条 街 ， 天 使 便 离 开 他 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. \\n\\n [bbe] And when they had gone past the first and second watchmen they came to the iron door into the town, which came open by itself: and they went out and down one street; and then the angel went away. \\n\\n 12:11 [hgb] 彼 得 醒 悟 过 来 ， 说 ， 我 现 在 真 知 道 主 差 遣 他 的 使 者 ， 救 我 脱 离 希 律 的 手 ， 和 犹 太 百 姓 一 切 所 盼 望 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Peter came to his senses he said, Now, truly, I am certain that the Lord has sent his angel and taken me out of the hands of Herod, against all the hopes of the Jews. \\n\\n 12:12 [hgb] 想 了 一 想 ， 就 往 那 称 呼 马 可 的 约 翰 他 母 亲 马 利 亚 家 去 。 在 那 里 有 好 些 人 聚 集 祷 告 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying. \\n\\n [bbe] And when he became clear about this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John named Mark, where a number of them had come together for prayer. \\n\\n 12:13 [hgb] 彼 得 敲 外 门 ， 有 一 个 使 女 ， 名 叫 罗 大 出 来 探 听 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. \\n\\n [bbe] And he gave a blow on the door, and a young girl came to it, named Rhoda. \\n\\n 12:14 [hgb] 听 得 是 彼 得 的 声 音 ， 就 欢 喜 得 顾 不 得 开 门 ， 跑 进 去 告 诉 众 人 说 ， 彼 得 站 在 门 外 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when she knew Peter\u0027s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. \\n\\n [bbe] And hearing the voice of Peter, in her joy she went running, without opening the door, to say that Peter was outside. \\n\\n 12:15 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 你 是 疯 了 。 使 女 极 力 地 说 ， 真 是 他 。 他 们 说 ， 必 是 他 的 天 使 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. \\n\\n [bbe] And they said to her, You are off your head. But still she said, with decision, that it was so. And they said, It is his angel. \\n\\n 12:16 [hgb] 彼 得 不 住 地 敲 门 。 他 们 开 了 门 ， 看 见 他 ， 就 甚 惊 奇 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished. \\n\\n [bbe] But Peter went on giving blows on the door: and when it was open and they saw him, they were full of wonder. \\n\\n 12:17 [hgb] 彼 得 摆 手 ， 不 要 他 们 作 声 ， 就 告 诉 他 们 主 怎 样 领 他 出 监 。 又 说 ， 你 们 把 这 事 告 诉 雅 各 ， 和 众 弟 兄 。 于 是 出 去 往 别 处 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place. \\n\\n [bbe] But he made a sign to them with his hand to be quiet, and gave them an account of how the Lord had taken him out of prison. And he said, Give the news to James and the brothers. And then he went away. \\n\\n 12:18 [hgb] 到 了 天 亮 ， 兵 丁 扰 乱 得 很 ， 不 知 道 彼 得 往 哪 里 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. \\n\\n [bbe] Now when it was day, the armed men were greatly troubled about what had become of Peter. \\n\\n 12:19 [hgb] 希 律 找 他 ， 找 不 着 ， 就 审 问 看 守 的 人 ， 吩 咐 把 他 们 拉 去 杀 了 。 后 来 希 律 离 开 犹 太 ， 下 该 撒 利 亚 去 ， 住 在 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode. \\n\\n [bbe] And Herod, when he sent for him, and he was not there, after questioning the watchmen, gave orders that they were to be put to death. Then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea for a time. \\n\\n 12:20 [hgb] 希 律 恼 怒 推 罗 西 顿 的 人 。 他 们 那 一 带 地 方 ， 是 从 王 的 地 土 得 粮 ， 因 此 就 托 了 王 的 内 侍 臣 伯 拉 斯 都 的 情 ， 一 心 来 求 和 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king\u0027s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king\u0027s country. \\n\\n [bbe] Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon: and they came to him, all together, and having made friends with Blastus, the controller of the king\u0027s house, they made a request for peace, because their country was dependent on the king\u0027s country for its food. \\n\\n 12:21 [hgb] 希 律 在 所 定 的 日 子 ， 穿 上 朝 服 ， 坐 在 位 上 ， 对 他 们 讲 论 一 番 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] And on the day which had been fixed, Herod, dressed in his robes and seated in his place, made a public statement to them. \\n\\n 12:22 [hgb] 百 姓 喊 着 说 ， 这 是 神 的 声 音 ， 不 是 人 的 声 音 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. \\n\\n [bbe] And the people, with loud cries, said, It is the voice of a god, not of a man. \\n\\n 12:23 [hgb] 希 律 不 归 荣 耀 给 神 ， 所 以 主 的 使 者 立 刻 罚 他 。 他 被 虫 所 咬 ， 气 就 绝 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost. \\n\\n [bbe] And straight away the angel of the Lord sent a disease on him, because he did not give the glory to God: and his flesh was wasted away by worms, and so he came to his end. \\n\\n 12:24 [hgb] 神 的 道 日 见 兴 旺 ， 越 发 广 传 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the word of God grew and multiplied. \\n\\n [bbe] But the word of the Lord went on increasing. \\n\\n 12:25 [hgb] 巴 拿 巴 和 扫 罗 ， 办 完 了 他 们 供 给 的 事 ， 就 从 耶 路 撒 冷 回 来 ， 带 着 称 呼 马 可 的 约 翰 同 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark. \\n\\n [bbe] And Barnabas and Saul came back from Jerusalem, when their work was ended, taking with them John named Mark. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2206.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
