And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. \n [bbe] And Saul gave approval to his death. Now at that time a violent attack was started against the church in Jerusalem; and all but the Apostles went away into all parts of Judaea and Samaria. \n 8:2 [hgb] 有 虔 诚 的 人 ， 把 司 提 反 埋 葬 了 ， 为 他 捶 胸 大 哭 。 \n [kjv] And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. \n [bbe] And God-fearing men put Stephen\u0027s body in its last resting-place, making great weeping over him. \n 8:3 [hgb] 扫 罗 却 残 害 教 会 ， 进 各 人 的 家 ， 拉 着 男 女 下 在 监 里 。 \n [kjv] As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. \n [bbe] But Saul was burning with hate against the church, going into every house and taking men and women and putting them in prison. \n 8:4 [hgb] 那 些 分 散 的 人 ， 往 各 处 去 传 道 。 \n [kjv] Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. \n [bbe] But those who had gone in flight went everywhere preaching the word. \n 8:5 [hgb] 腓 利 下 撒 玛 利 亚 城 去 ， 宣 讲 基 督 。 \n [kjv] Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. \n [bbe] And Philip went down to Samaria and was teaching them about Christ. \n 8:6 [hgb] 众 人 听 见 了 ， 又 看 见 腓 利 所 行 的 神 迹 ， 就 同 心 合 意 地 听 从 他 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. \n [bbe] And all the people gave attention to the words which Philip said, when they saw the signs which he did. \n 8:7 [hgb] 因 为 有 许 多 人 被 污 鬼 附 着 ， 那 些 鬼 大 声 呼 叫 ， 从 他 们 身 上 出 来 。 还 有 许 多 瘫 痪 的 ， 瘸 腿 的 ， 都 得 了 医 治 。 \n [kjv] For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. \n [bbe] For unclean spirits came out from those who had them, crying with a loud voice; and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well. \n 8:8 [hgb] 在 那 城 里 ， 就 大 有 欢 喜 。 \n [kjv] And there was great joy in that city. \n [bbe] And there was much joy in that town. \n 8:9 [hgb] 有 一 个 人 ， 名 叫 西 门 ， 向 来 在 那 城 里 行 邪 术 ， 妄 自 尊 大 ， 使 撒 玛 利 亚 的 百 姓 惊 奇 。 \n [kjv] But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: \n [bbe] But there was a certain man named Simon, who in the past had been a wonder-worker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was a great man: \n 8:10 [hgb] 无 论 大 小 ， 都 听 从 他 ， 说 ， 这 人 就 是 那 称 为 神 的 大 能 者 。 \n [kjv] To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. \n [bbe] To whom they all gave attention, from the smallest to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is named Great. \n 8:11 [hgb] 他 们 听 从 他 ， 因 他 久 用 邪 术 ， 使 他 们 惊 奇 。 \n [kjv] And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. \n [bbe] And they gave attention to him, because for a long time his wonder-working powers had kept them under his control. \n 8:12 [hgb] 及 至 他 们 信 了 腓 利 所 传 神 国 的 福 音 ， 和 耶 稣 基 督 的 名 ， 连 男 带 女 就 受 了 洗 。 \n [kjv] But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. \n [bbe] But when they had faith in the good news given by Philip about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, a number of men and women had baptism. \n 8:13 [hgb] 西 门 自 己 也 信 了 。 既 受 了 洗 ， 就 常 与 腓 利 在 一 处 。 看 见 他 所 行 的 神 迹 和 大 异 能 ， 就 甚 惊 奇 。 \n [kjv] Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. \n [bbe] And Simon himself had faith and, having had baptism, he went with Philip and, seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did, he was full of surprise. \n 8:14 [hgb] 使 徒 在 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 听 见 撒 玛 利 亚 人 领 受 了 神 的 道 ， 就 打 发 彼 得 约 翰 往 他 们 那 里 去 。 \n [kjv] Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: \n [bbe] Now when the Apostles at Jerusalem had news that the people of Samaria had taken the word of God into their hearts, they sent to them Peter and John; \n 8:15 [hgb] 两 个 人 到 了 ， 就 为 他 们 祷 告 ， 要 叫 他 们 受 圣 灵 。 \n [kjv] Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: \n [bbe] Who, when they came there, made prayer for them, that the Holy Spirit might be given to them: \n 8:16 [hgb] 因 为 圣 灵 还 没 有 降 在 他 们 一 个 人 身 上 。 他 们 只 奉 主 耶 稣 的 名 受 了 洗 。 \n [kjv] (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) \n [bbe] For up to that time he had not come on any of them; only baptism had been given to them in the name of the Lord Jesus. \n 8:17 [hgb] 于 是 使 徒 按 手 在 他 们 头 上 ， 他 们 就 受 了 圣 灵 。 \n [kjv] Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. \n [bbe] Then they put their hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came on them. \n 8:18 [hgb] 西 门 看 见 使 徒 按 手 ， 便 有 圣 灵 赐 下 。 就 拿 钱 给 使 徒 ， \n [kjv] And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles\u0027 hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, \n [bbe] Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the touch of the Apostles\u0027 hands, he made them an offering of money, saying, \n 8:19 [hgb] 说 ， 把 这 权 柄 也 给 我 ， 叫 我 手 按 着 谁 。 谁 就 可 以 受 圣 灵 。 \n [kjv] Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. \n [bbe] Give me this power, so that when I put my hands on anyone he may get the Holy Spirit. \n 8:20 [hgb] 彼 得 说 ， 你 的 银 子 ， 和 你 一 同 灭 亡 吧 。 因 你 想 神 的 恩 赐 ， 是 可 以 用 钱 买 的 。 \n [kjv] But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. \n [bbe] But Peter said, May your money come to destruction with you, because you had the idea that what is freely given by God may be got for a price. \n 8:21 [hgb] 你 在 这 道 上 ， 无 分 无 关 。 因 为 在 神 面 前 ， 你 的 心 不 正 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. \n [bbe] You have no part in this business, because your heart is not right before God. \n 8:22 [hgb] 你 当 懊 悔 你 这 罪 恶 ， 祈 求 主 。 或 者 你 心 里 的 意 念 可 得 赦 免 。 \n [kjv] Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. \n [bbe] Let your heart be changed, and make prayer to God that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts. \n 8:23 [hgb] 我 看 出 你 正 在 苦 胆 之 中 ， 被 罪 恶 捆 绑 。 \n [kjv] For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. \n [bbe] For I see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin. \n 8:24 [hgb] 西 门 说 ， 愿 你 们 为 我 求 主 ， 叫 你 们 所 说 的 ， 没 有 一 样 临 到 我 身 上 。 \n [kjv] Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. \n [bbe] And Simon, answering, said, Make prayer for me to the Lord, so that these things which you have said may not come on me. \n 8:25 [hgb] 使 徒 既 证 明 主 道 ， 而 且 传 讲 ， 就 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 一 路 在 撒 玛 利 亚 好 些 村 庄 传 扬 福 音 。 \n [kjv] And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. \n [bbe] So they, having given their witness and made clear the word of the Lord, went back to Jerusalem, giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of Samaria. \n 8:26 [hgb] 有 主 的 一 个 使 者 对 腓 利 说 ， 起 来 ， 向 南 走 ， 往 那 从 耶 路 撒 冷 下 迦 萨 的 路 上 去 。 那 路 是 旷 野 。 \n [kjv] And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. \n [bbe] But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Get up, and go to the south, to the road which goes from Jerusalem to Gaza, through the waste land. \n 8:27 [hgb] 腓 利 就 起 身 去 了 。 不 料 ， 有 一 个 埃 提 阿 伯 （ 即 古 实 ， 见 以 赛 亚 十 八 章 一 节 ） 人 ， 是 个 有 大 权 的 太 监 ， 在 埃 提 阿 伯 女 王 干 大 基 的 手 下 总 管 银 库 ， 他 上 耶 路 撒 冷 礼 拜 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, \n [bbe] And he went and there was a man of Ethiopia, a servant of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and controller of all her property, who had come up to Jerusalem for worship; \n 8:28 [hgb] 现 在 回 来 ， 在 车 上 坐 着 ， 念 先 知 以 赛 亚 的 书 。 \n [kjv] Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. \n [bbe] He was going back, seated in his carriage, and was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah. \n 8:29 [hgb] 圣 灵 对 腓 利 说 ， 你 去 贴 近 那 车 走 。 \n [kjv] Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. \n [bbe] And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and get on his carriage. \n 8:30 [hgb] 腓 利 就 跑 到 太 监 那 里 ， 听 见 他 念 先 知 以 赛 亚 的 书 ， 便 问 他 说 ， 你 所 念 的 ， 你 明 白 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? \n [bbe] And Philip, running up to him, saw that he was reading Isaiah the prophet, and said to him, Is the sense of what you are reading clear to you? \n 8:31 [hgb] 他 说 ， 没 有 人 指 教 我 ， 怎 能 明 白 呢 ？ 于 是 请 腓 利 上 车 ， 与 他 同 坐 。 \n [kjv] And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. \n [bbe] And he said, How is that possible when I have no guide? And he made Philip get up by his side. \n 8:32 [hgb] 他 所 念 的 那 段 经 ， 说 ， 他 像 羊 被 牵 到 宰 杀 之 地 ， 又 像 羊 羔 在 剪 毛 的 人 手 下 无 声 ， 他 也 是 这 样 不 开 口 。 \n [kjv] The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: \n [bbe] Now the place in the book where he was reading was this: He was taken, like a sheep, to be put to death; and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut, so he made no sound: \n 8:33 [hgb] 他 卑 微 的 时 候 ， 人 不 按 公 义 审 判 他 。 （ 原 文 作 他 的 审 判 被 夺 去 ） 谁 能 述 说 他 的 世 代 ， 因 为 他 的 生 命 从 地 上 夺 去 。 \n [kjv] In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. \n [bbe] Being of low degree, his cause was not given a hearing: who has knowledge of his family? for his life is cut off from the earth. \n 8:34 [hgb] 太 监 对 腓 利 说 ， 请 问 先 知 说 这 话 ， 是 指 着 谁 ， 是 指 着 自 己 呢 ？ 是 指 着 别 人 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? \n [bbe] And the Ethiopian said to Philip, About whom are these words said by the prophet? about himself, or some other? \n 8:35 [hgb] 腓 利 就 开 口 从 这 经 上 起 ， 对 他 传 讲 耶 稣 \n [kjv] Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. \n [bbe] So Philip, starting from this writing, gave him the good news about Jesus. \n 8:36 [hgb] 二 人 正 往 前 走 ， 到 了 有 水 的 地 方 ， 太 监 说 ， 看 哪 ， 这 里 有 水 ， 我 受 洗 有 什 么 妨 碍 呢 ？ （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 \n [kjv] And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? \n [bbe] And while they were going on their way, they came to some water, and the Ethiopian said, See, here is water; why may I not have baptism? \n 8:37 [hgb] 腓 利 说 ， 你 若 是 一 心 相 信 就 可 以 ， 他 回 答 说 ， 我 信 耶 稣 基 督 是 神 的 儿 子 ） \n [kjv] And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. \n [bbe] [] \n 8:38 [hgb] 于 是 吩 咐 车 站 住 ， 腓 利 和 太 监 二 人 同 下 水 里 去 ， 腓 利 就 给 他 施 洗 。 \n [kjv] And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. \n [bbe] And he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped, and the two of them went down into the water, and Philip gave him baptism. \n 8:39 [hgb] 从 水 里 上 来 ， 主 的 灵 把 腓 利 提 了 去 ， 太 监 也 不 再 见 他 了 ， 就 欢 欢 喜 喜 地 走 路 。 \n [kjv] And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. \n [bbe] And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away; and the Ethiopian saw him no more, for he went on his way full of joy. \n 8:40 [hgb] 后 来 有 人 在 亚 锁 都 遇 见 腓 利 ， 他 走 遍 那 地 方 ， 在 各 城 宣 传 福 音 ， 直 到 该 撒 利 亚 。 \n [kjv] But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. \n [bbe] But Philip came to Azotus, and went through all the towns, preaching the good news, till he came to Caesarea. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2202.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
