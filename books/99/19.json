And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. \n [bbe] And he said to them, Did you get the Holy Spirit when you had faith? And they said to him, No, we have had no knowledge of the Holy Spirit. \n 19:3 [hgb] 保 罗 说 ， 这 样 ， 你 们 受 的 是 什 么 洗 呢 ？ 他 们 说 ， 是 约 翰 的 洗 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John\u0027s baptism. \n [bbe] And he said, What sort of baptism did you have? And they said, The baptism of John. \n 19:4 [hgb] 保 罗 说 ， 约 翰 所 行 的 是 悔 改 的 洗 ， 告 诉 百 姓 ， 当 信 那 在 他 以 后 要 来 的 ， 就 是 耶 稣 。 \n [kjv] Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. \n [bbe] And Paul said, John gave a baptism which goes with a change of heart, saying to the people that they were to have faith in him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus. \n 19:5 [hgb] 他 们 听 见 这 话 ， 就 奉 主 耶 稣 的 名 受 洗 。 \n [kjv] When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. \n [bbe] And hearing this, they had baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus. \n 19:6 [hgb] 保 罗 按 手 在 他 们 头 上 ， 圣 灵 便 降 在 他 们 身 上 。 他 们 就 说 方 言 ， 又 说 预 言 。 （ 或 作 又 讲 道 ） 。 \n [kjv] And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. \n [bbe] And when Paul had put his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they had the power of talking in tongues, and acting like prophets. \n 19:7 [hgb] 一 共 约 有 十 二 个 人 。 \n [kjv] And all the men were about twelve. \n [bbe] And there were about twelve of these men. \n 19:8 [hgb] 保 罗 进 会 堂 ， 放 胆 讲 道 ， 一 连 三 个 月 ， 辩 论 神 国 的 事 ， 劝 化 众 人 。 \n [kjv] And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. \n [bbe] And he went into the Synagogue, and for three months he was preaching there without fear, reasoning and teaching about the kingdom of God. \n 19:9 [hgb] 后 来 有 些 人 ， 心 里 刚 硬 不 信 ， 在 众 人 面 前 毁 谤 这 道 ， 保 罗 就 离 开 他 们 ， 也 叫 门 徒 与 他 们 分 离 ， 便 在 推 喇 奴 的 学 房 ， 天 天 辩 论 。 \n [kjv] But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. \n [bbe] But because some of the people were hard-hearted and would not give hearing, saying evil words about the Way before the people, he went away from them, and kept the disciples separate, reasoning every day in the school of Tyrannus. \n 19:10 [hgb] 这 样 有 两 年 之 久 ， 叫 一 切 住 在 亚 西 亚 的 ， 无 论 是 犹 太 人 ， 是 希 利 尼 人 ， 都 听 见 主 的 道 。 \n [kjv] And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. \n [bbe] And this went on for two years, so that all those who were living in Asia had knowledge of the word of the Lord, Greeks as well as Jews. \n 19:11 [hgb] 神 借 保 罗 的 手 ， 行 了 些 非 常 的 奇 事 。 \n [kjv] And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: \n [bbe] And God did special works of power by the hands of Paul: \n 19:12 [hgb] 甚 至 有 人 从 保 罗 身 上 拿 手 巾 ， 或 围 裙 ， 放 在 病 人 身 上 ， 病 就 退 了 ， 恶 鬼 也 出 去 了 。 \n [kjv] So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. \n [bbe] So that bits of linen and clothing from his body were taken to people who were ill, and their diseases went away from them and the evil spirits went out. \n 19:13 [hgb] 那 时 ， 有 几 个 游 行 各 处 ， 念 咒 赶 鬼 的 犹 太 人 ， 向 那 被 恶 鬼 附 的 人 ， 擅 自 称 主 耶 稣 的 名 ， 说 ， 我 奉 保 罗 所 传 的 耶 稣 ， 敕 令 你 们 出 来 。 \n [kjv] Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. \n [bbe] But some of the Jews who went from place to place driving out evil spirits, took it on themselves to make use of the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, I give you orders, by Jesus, whom Paul is preaching. \n 19:14 [hgb] 作 这 事 的 ， 有 犹 太 祭 司 长 士 基 瓦 的 七 个 儿 子 。 \n [kjv] And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. \n [bbe] And there were seven sons of a man named Sceva, a Jew and a chief priest, who did this. \n 19:15 [hgb] 恶 鬼 回 答 他 们 说 ， 耶 稣 我 认 识 ， 保 罗 我 也 知 道 。 你 们 却 是 谁 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? \n [bbe] And the evil spirit, answering, said to them, I have knowledge of Jesus, and of Paul, but who are you? \n 19:16 [hgb] 恶 鬼 所 附 的 人 ， 就 跳 在 他 们 身 上 ， 胜 了 其 中 二 人 ， 制 伏 他 们 ， 叫 他 们 赤 着 身 子 受 了 伤 ， 从 那 房 子 里 逃 出 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. \n [bbe] And the man in whom the evil spirit was, jumping on them, was stronger than the two of them, and overcame them, so that they went running from that house, wounded and without their clothing. \n 19:17 [hgb] 凡 住 在 以 弗 所 的 ， 无 论 是 犹 太 人 ， 是 希 利 尼 人 ， 都 知 道 这 事 ， 也 都 惧 怕 ， 主 耶 稣 的 名 从 此 就 尊 大 了 。 \n [kjv] And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. \n [bbe] And this came to the ears of all those, Jews and Greeks, who were living at Ephesus; and fear came on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was made great. \n 19:18 [hgb] 那 已 经 信 的 ， 多 有 人 来 承 认 诉 说 自 己 所 行 的 事 。 \n [kjv] And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. \n [bbe] And a number of those who had faith came and made a public statement of their sins and all their acts. \n 19:19 [hgb] 平 素 行 邪 术 的 ， 也 有 许 多 人 把 书 拿 来 ， 堆 积 在 众 人 面 前 焚 烧 。 他 们 算 计 书 价 ， 便 知 道 共 合 五 万 块 钱 。 \n [kjv] Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. \n [bbe] And a great number of those who were experts in strange arts took their books and put them on the fire in front of everyone: and when the books were valued they came to fifty thousand bits of silver. \n 19:20 [hgb] 主 的 道 大 大 兴 旺 而 且 得 胜 ， 就 是 这 样 。 \n [kjv] So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed. \n [bbe] So the word of the Lord was increased very greatly and was full of power. \n 19:21 [hgb] 这 些 事 完 了 ， 保 罗 心 里 定 意 ， 经 过 了 马 其 顿 ， 亚 该 亚 就 往 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 又 说 ， 我 到 了 那 里 以 后 ， 也 必 须 往 罗 马 去 看 看 。 \n [kjv] After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. \n [bbe] Now after these things were ended, Paul came to a decision that when he had gone through Macedonia and Achaia he would go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I have a desire to see Rome. \n 19:22 [hgb] 于 是 从 帮 助 他 的 人 中 ， 打 发 提 摩 太 ， 以 拉 都 二 人 ， 往 马 其 顿 去 。 自 己 暂 时 等 在 亚 西 亚 。 \n [kjv] So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season. \n [bbe] And having sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, he himself went on living in Asia for a time. \n 19:23 [hgb] 那 时 ， 因 为 这 道 起 的 扰 乱 不 小 。 \n [kjv] And the same time there arose no small stir about that way. \n [bbe] And about that time a great outcry took place about the Way. \n 19:24 [hgb] 有 一 个 银 匠 ， 名 叫 底 米 丢 ， 是 制 造 亚 底 米 神 银 龛 的 ， 他 使 这 样 手 艺 人 生 意 发 达 。 \n [kjv] For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen; \n [bbe] For there was a certain man named Demetrius, a silver-worker, who made silver boxes for the images of Diana, and gave no small profit to the workmen; \n 19:25 [hgb] 他 聚 集 他 们 和 同 行 的 工 人 ， 说 ， 众 位 ， 你 们 知 道 我 们 是 倚 靠 这 生 意 发 财 。 \n [kjv] Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. \n [bbe] Whom he got together, with other workmen of the same trade, and said to them, Men, it is clear that from this business we get our wealth. \n 19:26 [hgb] 这 保 罗 不 但 在 以 弗 所 ， 也 几 乎 在 亚 西 亚 全 地 ， 引 诱 迷 惑 许 多 人 ， 说 ， 人 手 所 作 的 不 是 神 ， 这 是 你 们 所 看 见 所 听 见 的 。 \n [kjv] Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: \n [bbe] And you see, for it has come to your ears, that not only at Ephesus, but almost all through Asia, this Paul has been teaching numbers of people and turning them away, saying that those are not gods who are made by men\u0027s hands: \n 19:27 [hgb] 这 样 ， 不 独 我 们 这 事 业 ， 被 人 藐 视 ， 就 是 大 女 神 亚 底 米 的 庙 ， 也 要 被 人 轻 忽 ， 连 亚 西 亚 全 地 ， 和 普 天 下 ， 所 敬 拜 的 大 女 神 之 威 荣 ， 也 要 消 灭 了 。 \n [kjv] So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. \n [bbe] And there is danger, not only that our trade may be damaged in the opinion of men, but that the holy place of the great goddess Diana may be no longer honoured, and that she to whom all Asia and the world give worship, will be put down from her high position. \n 19:28 [hgb] 众 人 听 见 ， 就 怒 气 填 胸 ， 喊 着 说 ， 大 哉 以 弗 所 人 的 亚 底 米 阿 。 \n [kjv] And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. \n [bbe] And hearing this, they were very angry, crying out and saying, Great is Diana of Ephesus. \n 19:29 [hgb] 满 城 都 轰 动 起 来 。 众 人 拿 住 与 保 罗 同 行 的 马 其 顿 人 该 犹 和 亚 里 达 古 ， 齐 心 拥 进 戏 园 里 去 。 \n [kjv] And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul\u0027s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre. \n [bbe] And the town was full of noise and trouble, and they all came running into the theatre, having taken by force Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia who were journeying in company with Paul. \n 19:30 [hgb] 保 罗 想 要 进 去 ， 到 百 姓 那 里 ， 门 徒 却 不 许 他 去 。 \n [kjv] And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. \n [bbe] And when Paul was about to go in to the people, the disciples did not let him. \n 19:31 [hgb] 还 有 亚 西 亚 几 位 首 领 ， 是 保 罗 的 朋 友 ， 打 发 人 来 劝 他 ， 不 要 冒 险 到 戏 园 里 去 。 \n [kjv] And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre. \n [bbe] And some of the rulers of Asia, being his friends, sent to him, requesting him seriously not to put himself in danger by going into the theatre. \n 19:32 [hgb] 聚 集 的 人 ， 纷 纷 乱 乱 ， 有 喊 叫 这 个 的 ， 有 喊 叫 那 个 的 ， 大 半 不 知 道 是 为 什 么 聚 集 。 \n [kjv] Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together. \n [bbe] And some said one thing, and some another: for there was no order in the meeting; and most of them had no idea why they had come together. \n 19:33 [hgb] 有 人 把 亚 力 山 大 从 众 人 中 带 出 来 ， 犹 太 人 推 他 往 前 ， 亚 力 山 大 就 摆 手 ， 要 向 百 姓 分 诉 。 \n [kjv] And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people. \n [bbe] Then they took Alexander out from among the people, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander, making a sign with his hand, was about to make a statement to the people in answer: \n 19:34 [hgb] 只 因 他 们 认 出 他 是 犹 太 人 ， 就 大 家 同 声 喊 着 说 ， 大 哉 以 弗 所 人 的 亚 底 米 阿 。 如 此 约 有 两 小 时 \n [kjv] But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. \n [bbe] But when they saw that he was a Jew, all of them with one voice went on crying out for about two hours, Great is Diana of Ephesus. \n 19:35 [hgb] 那 城 里 的 书 记 ， 安 抚 了 众 人 ， 就 说 ， 以 弗 所 人 哪 ， 谁 不 知 道 以 弗 所 人 的 城 ， 是 看 守 大 亚 底 米 的 庙 ， 和 从 丢 斯 那 里 落 下 来 的 像 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? \n [bbe] And when the chief secretary had got the people quiet, he said, Men of Ephesus, is any man without knowledge that the town of Ephesus is the keeper of the holy place of the great Diana, who was sent down from Jupiter? \n 19:36 [hgb] 这 事 既 是 驳 不 倒 的 ， 你 们 就 当 安 静 ， 不 可 造 次 。 \n [kjv] Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. \n [bbe] So then, because these things may not be doubted, it would be better for you to be quiet, and do nothing unwise. \n 19:37 [hgb] 你 们 把 这 些 人 带 来 ， 他 们 并 没 有 偷 窃 庙 中 之 物 ， 也 没 有 谤 ？ ？ 我 们 的 女 神 。 \n [kjv] For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. \n [bbe] For you have taken these men, who are not doing damage to the holy place or talking against our goddess. \n 19:38 [hgb] 若 是 底 米 丢 和 他 同 行 的 人 ， 有 控 告 人 的 事 ， 自 有 放 告 的 日 子 。 （ 或 作 自 有 公 堂 ） 也 有 方 伯 ， 可 以 彼 此 对 告 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another. \n [bbe] If, then, Demetrius and the workmen who are with him have a protest to make against any man, the law is open to them, and there are judges; let them put up a cause at law against one another. \n 19:39 [hgb] 你 们 若 问 别 的 事 ， 就 可 以 照 常 例 聚 集 断 定 。 \n [kjv] But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. \n [bbe] But if any other business is in question, let it be taken up in the regular meeting. \n 19:40 [hgb] 今 日 的 扰 乱 ， 本 是 无 缘 无 故 ， 我 们 难 免 被 查 问 。 论 到 这 样 聚 众 ， 我 们 也 说 不 出 所 以 然 来 。 \n [kjv] For we are in danger to be called in question for this day\u0027s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse. \n [bbe] For, truly, we are in danger of being made responsible for this day\u0027s trouble, there being no cause for it: and we are not able to give any reason for this coming together. \n 19:41 [hgb] 说 了 这 话 ， 便 叫 众 人 散 去 。 \n [kjv] And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly. \n [bbe] And when he had said this, he sent the meeting away. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161/2213.html","bookId":99,"book":{"id":99,"title":"使徒行传 Acts","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 阿 ， 我 已 经 作 了 前 书 ， 论 到 耶 稣 开 头 一 切 所 行 所 教 训 的 ， [kjv] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/161","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
