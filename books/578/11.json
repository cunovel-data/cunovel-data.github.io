{"id":11250,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"One Sunday the race for the Grand Prix de Paris was being run in the Bois de Boulogne beneath skies rendered sultry by the first heats of June. The sun that morning had risen amid a mist of dun-colored dust, but toward eleven o\u0027clock, just when the carriages were reaching the Longchamps course, a southerly wind had swept away the clouds; long streamers of gray vapor were disappearing across the sky, and gaps showing an intense blue beyond were spreading from one end of the horizon to the other. In the bright bursts of sunlight which alternated with the clouds the whole scene shone again, from the field which was gradually filling with a crowd of carriages, horsemen and pedestrians, to the still-vacant course, where the judge\u0027s box stood, together with the posts and the masts for signaling numbers, and thence on to the five symmetrical stands of brickwork and timber, rising gallery upon gallery in the middle of the weighing enclosure opposite. Beyond these, bathed in the light of noon, lay the vast level plain, bordered with little trees and shut in to the westward by the wooded heights of Saint-Cloud and the Suresnes, which, in their turn, were dominated by the severe outlines of Mont-Valerien. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nana, as excited as if the Grand Prix were going to make her fortune, wanted to take up a position by the railing next the winning post. She had arrived very early--she was, in fact, one of the first to come--in a landau adorned with silver and drawn, a la Daumont, by four splendid white horses. This landau was a present from Count Muffat. When she had made her appearance at the entrance to the field with two postilions jogging blithely on the near horses and two footmen perching motionless behind the carriage, the people had rushed to look as though a queen were passing. She sported the blue and white colors of the Vandeuvres stable, and her dress was remarkable. It consisted of a little blue silk bodice and tunic, which fitted closely to the body and bulged out enormously behind her waist, thereby bringing her lower limbs into bold relief in such a manner as to be extremely noticeable in that epoch of voluminous skirts. Then there was a white satin dress with white satin sleeves and a sash worn crosswise over the shoulders, the whole ornamented with silver guipure which shone in the sun. In addition to this, in order to be still more like a jockey, she had stuck a blue toque with a white feather jauntily upon her chignon, the fair tresses from which flowed down beyond her shoulders and resembled an enormous russet pigtail. \\n\\n \\n\\n Twelve struck. The public would have to wait more than three hours for the Grand Prix to be run. When the landau had drawn up beside the barriers Nana settled herself comfortably down as though she were in her own house. A whim had prompted her to bring Bijou and Louiset with her, and the dog crouched among her skirts, shivering with cold despite the heat of the day, while amid a bedizenment of ribbons and laces the child\u0027s poor little face looked waxen and dumb and white in the open air. Meanwhile the young woman, without troubling about the people near her, talked at the top of her voice with Georges and Philippe Hugon, who were seated opposite on the front seat among such a mountain of bouquets of white roses and blue myosotis that they were buried up to their shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well then,\" she was saying, \"as he bored me to death, I showed him the door. And now it\u0027s two days that he\u0027s been sulking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She was talking of Muffat, but she took care not to confess to the young men the real reason for this first quarrel, which was that one evening he had found a man\u0027s hat in her bedroom. She had indeed brought home a passer-by out of sheer ennui--a silly infatuation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have no idea how funny he is,\" she continued, growing merry over the particulars she was giving. \"He\u0027s a regular bigot at bottom, so he says his prayers every evening. Yes, he does. He\u0027s under the impression I notice nothing because I go to bed first so as not to be in his way, but I watch him out of the corner of my eye. Oh, he jaws away, and then he crosses himself when he turns round to step over me and get to the inside of the bed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jove, it\u0027s sly,\" muttered Philippe. \"That\u0027s what happens before, but afterward, what then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She laughed merrily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, just so, before and after! When I\u0027m going to sleep I hear him jawing away again. But the biggest bore of all is that we can\u0027t argue about anything now without his growing \u0027pi.\u0027 I\u0027ve always been religious. Yes, chaff as much as you like; that won\u0027t prevent me believing what I do believe! Only he\u0027s too much of a nuisance: he blubbers; he talks about remorse. The day before yesterday, for instance, he had a regular fit of it after our usual row, and I wasn\u0027t the least bit reassured when all was over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But she broke off, crying out: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just look at the Mignons arriving. Dear me, they\u0027ve brought the children! Oh, how those little chaps are dressed up!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Mignons were in a landau of severe hue; there was something substantially luxurious about their turnout, suggesting rich retired tradespeople. Rose was in a gray silk gown trimmed with red knots and with puffs; she was smiling happily at the joyous behavior of Henri and Charles, who sat on the front seat, looking awkward in their ill-fitting collegians\u0027 tunics. But when the landau had drawn up by the rails and she perceived Nana sitting in triumph among her bouquets, with her four horses and her liveries, she pursed up her lips, sat bolt upright and turned her head away. Mignon, on the other hand, looking the picture of freshness and gaiety, waved her a salutation. He made it a matter of principle to keep out of feminine disagreements. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By the by,\" Nana resumed, \"d\u0027you know a little old man who\u0027s very clean and neat and has bad teeth--a Monsieur Venot? He came to see me this morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur Venot?\" said Georges in great astonishment. \"It\u0027s impossible! Why, the man\u0027s a Jesuit!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Precisely; I spotted that. Oh, you have no idea what our conversation was like! It was just funny! He spoke to me about the count, about his divided house, and begged me to restore a family its happiness. He was very polite and very smiling for the matter of that. Then I answered to the effect that I wanted nothing better, and I undertook to reconcile the count and his wife. You know it\u0027s not humbug. I should be delighted to see them all happy again, the poor things! Besides, it would be a relief to me for there are days--yes, there are days--when he bores me to death.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The weariness of the last months escaped her in this heartfelt outburst. Moreover, the count appeared to be in big money difficulties; he was anxious and it seemed likely that the bill which Labordette had put his name to would not be met. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear me, the countess is down yonder,\" said Georges, letting his gaze wander over the stands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where, where?\" cried Nana. \"What eyes that baby\u0027s got! Hold my sunshade, Philippe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But with a quick forward dart Georges had outstripped his brother. It enchanted him to be holding the blue silk sunshade with its silver fringe. Nana was scanning the scene through a huge pair of field glasses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah yes! I see her,\" she said at length. \"In the right-hand stand, near a pillar, eh? She\u0027s in mauve, and her daughter in white by her side. Dear me, there\u0027s Daguenet going to bow to them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Thereupon Philippe talked of Daguenet\u0027s approaching marriage with that lath of an Estelle. It was a settled matter--the banns were being published. At first the countess had opposed it, but the count, they said, had insisted. Nana smiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know, I know,\" she murmured. \"So much the better for Paul. He\u0027s a nice boy--he deserves it\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And leaning toward Louiset: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re enjoying yourself, eh? What a grave face!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The child never smiled. With a very old expression he was gazing at all those crowds, as though the sight of them filled him with melancholy reflections. Bijou, chased from the skirts of the young woman who was moving about a great deal, had come to nestle, shivering, against the little fellow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile the field was filling up. Carriages, a compact, interminable file of them, were continually arriving through the Porte de la Cascade. There were big omnibuses such as the Pauline, which had started from the Boulevard des Italiens, freighted with its fifty passengers, and was now going to draw up to the right of the stands. Then there were dogcarts, victorias, landaus, all superbly well turned out, mingled with lamentable cabs which jolted along behind sorry old hacks, and four-in-hands, sending along their four horses, and mail coaches, where the masters sat on the seats above and left the servants to take care of the hampers of champagne inside, and \"spiders,\" the immense wheels of which were a flash of glittering steel, and light tandems, which looked as delicately formed as the works of a clock and slipped along amid a peal of little bells. Every few seconds an equestrian rode by, and a swarm of people on foot rushed in a scared way among the carriages. On the green the far-off rolling sound which issued from the avenues in the Bois died out suddenly in dull rustlings, and now nothing was audible save the hubbub of the ever-increasing crowds and cries and calls and the crackings of whips in the open. When the sun, amid bursts of wind, reappeared at the edge of a cloud, a long ray of golden light ran across the field, lit up the harness and the varnished coach panels and touched the ladies\u0027 dresses with fire, while amid the dusty radiance the coachmen, high up on their boxes,flamed beside their great whips. \\n\\n \\n\\n Labordette was getting out of an open carriage where Gaga, Clarisse and Blanche de Sivry had kept a place for him. As he was hurrying to cross the course and enter the weighing enclosure Nana got Georges to call him. Then when he came up: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the betting on me?\" she asked laughingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n She referred to the filly Nana, the Nana who had let herself be shamefully beaten in the race for the Prix de Diane and had not even been placed in April and May last when she ran for the Prix des Cars and the Grande Poule des Produits, both of which had been gained by Lusignan, the other horse in the Vandeuvres stable. Lusignan had all at once become prime favorite, and since yesterday he had been currently taken at two to one. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Always fifty to one against,\" replied Labordette. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The deuce! I\u0027m not worth much,\" rejoined Nana, amused by the jest. \"I don\u0027t back myself then; no, by jingo! I don\u0027t put a single louis on myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Labordette went off again in a great hurry, but she recalled him. She wanted some advice. Since he kept in touch with the world of trainers and jockeys he had special information about various stables. His prognostications had come true a score of times already, and people called him the \"King of Tipsters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s see, what horses ought I to choose?\" said the young woman. \"What\u0027s the betting on the Englishman?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Spirit? Three to one against. Valerio II, the same. As to the others, they\u0027re laying twenty-five to one against Cosinus, forty to one against Hazard, thirty to one against Bourn, thirty-five to one against Pichenette, ten to one against Frangipane.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t bet on the Englishman, I don\u0027t. I\u0027m a patriot. Perhaps Valerio II would do, eh? The Duc de Corbreuse was beaming a little while ago. Well, no, after all! Fifty louis on Lusignan; what do you say to that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Labordette looked at her with a singular expression. She leaned forward and asked him questions in a low voice, for she was aware that Vandeuvres commissioned him to arrange matters with the bookmakers so as to be able to bet the more easily. Supposing him to have got to know something, he might quite well tell it her. But without entering into explanations Labordette persuaded her to trust to his sagacity. He would put on her fifty louis for her as he might think best, and she would not repent of his arrangement. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All the horses you like!\" she cried gaily, letting him take his departure, \"but no Nana; she\u0027s a jade!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a burst of uproarious laughter in the carriage. The young men thought her sally very amusing, while Louiset in his ignorance lifted his pale eyes to his mother\u0027s face, for her loud exclamations surprised him. However, there was no escape for Labordette as yet. Rose Mignon had made a sign to him and was now giving him her commands while he wrote figures in a notebook. Then Clarisse and Gaga called him back in order to change their bets, for they had heard things said in the crowd, and now they didn\u0027t want to have anything more to do with Valerio II and were choosing Lusignan. He wrote down their wishes with an impassible expression and at length managed to escape. He could be seen disappearing between two of the stands on the other side of the course. \\n\\n \\n\\n Carriages were still arriving. They were by this time drawn up five rows deep, and a dense mass of them spread along the barriers, checkered by the light coats of white horses. Beyond them other carriages stood about in comparative isolation, looking as though they had stuck fast in the grass. Wheels and harness were here, there and everywhere, according as the conveyances to which they belonged were side by side, at an angle, across and across or head to head. Over such spaces of turf as still remained unoccupied cavaliers kept trotting, and black groups of pedestrians moved continually. The scene resembled the field where a fair is being held, and above it all, amid the confused motley of the crowd, the drinking booths raised their gray canvas roofs which gleamed white in the sunshine. But a veritable tumult, a mob, an eddy of hats, surged round the several bookmakers, who stood in open carriages gesticulating like itinerant dentists while their odds were pasted up on tall boards beside them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All the same, it\u0027s stupid not to know on what horse one\u0027s betting,\" Nana was remarking. \"I really must risk some louis in person.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She had stood up to select a bookmaker with a decent expression of face but forgot what she wanted on perceiving a perfect crowd of her acquaintance. Besides the Mignons, besides Gaga, Clarisse and Blanche, there were present, to the right and left, behind and in the middle of the mass of carriages now hemming in her landau, the following ladies: Tatan Nene and Maria Blond in a victoria, Caroline Hequet with her mother and two gentlemen in an open carriage, Louise Violaine quite alone, driving a little basket chaise decked with orange and green ribbons, the colors of the Mechain stables, and finally, Lea de Horn on the lofty seat of a mail coach, where a band of young men were making a great din. Farther off, in a HUIT RESSORTS of aristocratic appearance, Lucy Stewart, in a very simple black silk dress, sat, looking distinguished beside a tall young man in the uniform of a naval cadet. But what most astounded Nana was the arrival of Simonne in a tandem which Steiner was driving, while a footman sat motionless, with folded arms, behind them. She looked dazzling in white satin striped with yellow and was covered with diamonds from waist to hat. The banker, on his part, was handling a tremendous whip and sending along his two horses, which were harnessed tandemwise, the leader being a little warm-colored chestnut with a mouselike trot, the shaft horse a big brown bay, a stepper, with a fine action. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Deuce take it!\" said Nana. \"So that thief Steiner has cleared the Bourse again, has he? I say, isn\u0027t Simonne a swell! It\u0027s too much of a good thing; he\u0027ll get into the clutches of the law!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nevertheless, she exchanged greetings at a distance. Indeed, she kept waving her hand and smiling, turning round and forgetting no one in her desire to be seen by everybody. At the same time she continued chatting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s her son Lucy\u0027s got in tow! He\u0027s charming in his uniform. That\u0027s why she\u0027s looking so grand, of course! You know she\u0027s afraid of him and that she passes herself off as an actress. Poor young man, I pity him all the same! He seems quite unsuspicious.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bah,\" muttered Philippe, laughing, \"she\u0027ll be able to find him an heiress in the country when she likes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nana was silent, for she had just noticed the Tricon amid the thick of the carriages. Having arrived in a cab, whence she could not see anything, the Tricon had quietly mounted the coach box. And there, straightening up her tall figure, with her noble face enshrined in its long curls, she dominated the crowd as though enthroned amid her feminine subjects. All the latter smiled discreetly at her while she, in her superiority, pretended not to know them. She wasn\u0027t there for business purposes: she was watching the races for the love of the thing, as became a frantic gambler with a passion for horseflesh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear me, there\u0027s that idiot La Faloise!\" said Georges suddenly. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a surprise to them all. Nana did not recognize her La Faloise, for since he had come into his inheritance he had grown extraordinarily up to date. He wore a low collar and was clad in a cloth of delicate hue which fitted close to his meager shoulders. His hair was in little bandeaux, and he affected a weary kind of swagger, a soft tone of voice and slang words and phrases which he did not take the trouble to finish. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But he\u0027s quite the thing!\" declared Nana in perfect enchantment. \\n\\n \\n\\n Gaga and Clarisse had called La Faloise and were throwing themselves at him in their efforts to regain his allegiance, but he left them immediately, rolling off in a chaffing, disdainful manner. Nana dazzled him. He rushed up to her and stood on the carriage step, and when she twitted him about Gaga he murmured: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh dear, no! We\u0027ve seen the last of the old lot! Mustn\u0027t play her off on me any more. And then, you know, it\u0027s you now, Juliet mine!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He had put his hand to his heart. Nana laughed a good deal at this exceedingly sudden out-of-door declaration. She continued: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say, that\u0027s not what I\u0027m after. You\u0027re making me forget that I want to lay wagers. Georges, you see that bookmaker down there, a great red-faced man with curly hair? He\u0027s got a dirty blackguard expression which I like. You\u0027re to go and choose--Oh, I say, what can one choose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a patriotic soul--oh dear, no!\" La Faloise blurted out. \"I\u0027m all for the Englishman. It will be ripping if the Englishman gains! The French may go to Jericho!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nana was scandalized. Presently the merits of the several horses began to be discussed, and La Faloise, wishing to be thought very much in the swim, spoke of them all as sorry jades. Frangipane, Baron Verdier\u0027s horse, was by The Truth out of Lenore. A big bay horse he was, who would certainly have stood a chance if they hadn\u0027t let him get foundered during training. As to Valerio II from the Corbreuse stable, he wasn\u0027t ready yet; he\u0027d had the colic in April. Oh yes, they were keeping that dark, but he was sure of it, on his honor! In the end he advised Nana to choose Hazard, the most defective of the lot, a horse nobody would have anything to do with. Hazard, by jingo--such superb lines and such an action! That horse was going to astonish the people. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Nana, \"I\u0027m going to put ten louis on Lusignan and five on Boum.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n La Faloise burst forth at once: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, my dear girl, Boum\u0027s all rot! Don\u0027t choose him! Gasc himself is chucking up backing his own horse. And your Lusignan--never! Why, it\u0027s all humbug! By Lamb and Princess--just think! By Lamb and Princess--no, by Jove! All too short in the legs!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was choking. Philippe pointed out that, notwithstanding this, Lusignan had won the Prix des Cars and the Grande Poule des Produits. But the other ran on again. What did that prove? Nothing at all. On the contrary, one ought to distrust him. And besides, Gresham rode Lusignan; well then, let them jolly well dry up! Gresham had bad luck; he would never get to the post. \\n\\n \\n\\n And from one end of the field to the other the discussion raging in Nana\u0027s landau seemed to spread and increase. Voices were raised in a scream; the passion for gambling filled the air, set faces glowing and arms waving excitedly, while the bookmakers, perched on their conveyances, shouted odds and jotted down amounts right furiously. Yet these were only the small fry of the betting world; the big bets were made in the weighing enclosure. Here, then, raged the keen contest of people with light purses who risked their five-franc pieces and displayed infinite covetousness for the sake of a possible gain of a few louis. In a word, the battle would be between Spirit and Lusignan. Englishmen, plainly recognizable as such, were strolling about among the various groups. They were quite at home; their faces were fiery with excitement; they were afready triumphant. Bramah, a horse belonging to Lord Reading, had gained the Grand Prix the previous year, and this had been a defeat over which hearts were still bleeding. This year it would be terrible if France were beaten anew. Accordingly all the ladies were wild with national pride. The Vandeuvres stable became the rampart of their honor, and Lusignan was pushed and defended and applauded exceedingly. Gaga, Blanche, Caroline and the rest betted on Lusignan. Lucy Stewart abstained from this on account of her son, but it was bruited abroad that Rose Mignon had commissioned Labordette to risk two hundred louis for her. The Tricon, as she sat alone next her driver, waited till the last moment. Very cool, indeed, amid all these disputes, very far above the ever-increasing uproar in which horses\u0027 names kept recurring and lively Parisian phrases mingled with guttural English exclamations, she sat listening and taking notes majestically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And Nana?\" said Georges. \"Does no one want her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Indeed, nobody was asking for the filly; she was not even being mentioned. The outsider of the Vandeuvres\u0027s stud was swamped by Lusignan\u0027s popularity. But La Faloise flung his arms up, crying: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve an inspiration. I\u0027ll bet a louis on Nana.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bravo! I bet a couple,\" said Georges. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I three,\" added Philippe. \\n\\n \\n\\n And they mounted up and up, bidding against one another good-humoredly and naming prices as though they had been haggling over Nana at an auction. La Faloise said he would cover her with gold. Besides, everybody was to be made to back her; they would go and pick up backers. But as the three young men were darting off to propagandize, Nana shouted after them: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know I don\u0027t want to have anything to do with her; I don\u0027t for the world! Georges, ten louis on Lusignan and five on Valerio II.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile they had started fairly off, and she watched them gaily as they slipped between wheels, ducked under horses\u0027 heads and scoured the whole field. The moment they recognized anyone in a carriage they rushed up and urged Nana\u0027s claims. And there were great bursts of laughter among the crowd when sometimes they turned back, triumphantly signaling amounts with their fingers, while the young woman stood and waved her sunshade. Nevertheless, they made poor enough work of it. Some men let themselves be persuaded; Steiner, for instance, ventured three louis, for the sight of Nana stirred him. But the women refused point-blank. \"Thanks,\" they said; \"to lose for a certainty!\" Besides, they were in no hurry to work for the benefit of a dirty wench who was overwhelming them all with her four white horses, her postilions and her outrageous assumption of side. Gaga and Clarisse looked exceedingly prim and asked La Faloise whether he was jolly well making fun of them. When Georges boldly presented himself before the Mignons\u0027 carriage Rose turned her head away in the most marked manner and did not answer him. One must be a pretty foul sort to let one\u0027s name be given to a horse! Mignon, on the contrary, followed the young man\u0027s movements with a look of amusement and declared that the women always brought luck. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" queried Nana when the young men returned after a prolonged visit to the bookmakers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The odds are forty to one against you,\" said La Faloise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that? Forty to one!\" she cried, astounded. \"They were fifty to one against me. What\u0027s happened?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Labordette had just then reappeared. The course was being cleared, and the pealing of a bell announced the first race. Amid the expectant murmur of the bystanders she questioned him about this sudden rise in her value. But he replied evasively; doubtless a demand for her had arisen. She had to content herself with this explanation. Moreover, Labordette announced with a preoccupied expression that Vandeuvres was coming if he could get away. \\n\\n \\n\\n The race was ending unnoticed; people were all waiting for the Grand Prix to be run--when a storm burst over the Hippodrome. For some minutes past the sun had disappeared, and a wan twilight had darkened over the multitude. Then the wind rose, and there ensued a sudden deluge. Huge drops, perfect sheets of water, fell. There was a momentary confusion, and people shouted and joked and swore, while those on foot scampered madly off to find refuge under the canvas of the drinking booths. In the carriages the women did their best to shelter themselves, grasping their sunshades with both hands, while the bewildered footmen ran to the hoods. But the shower was already nearly over, and the sun began shining brilliantly through escaping clouds of fine rain. A blue cleft opened in the stormy mass, which was blown off over the Bois, and the skies seemed to smile again and to set the women laughing in a reassured manner, while amid the snorting of horses and the disarray and agitation of the drenched multitude that was shaking itself dry a broad flush of golden light lit up the field, still dripping and glittering with crystal drops. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, that poor, dear Louiset!\" said Nana. \"Are you very drenched, my darling?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The little thing silently allowed his hands to be wiped. The young woman had taken out her handkerchief. Then she dabbed it over Bijou, who was trembling more violently than ever. It would not matter in the least; there were a few drops on the white satin of her dress, but she didn\u0027t care a pin for them. The bouquets, refreshed by the rain, glowed like snow, and she smelled one ecstatically, drenching her lips in it as though it were wet with dew. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile the burst of rain had suddenly filled the stands. Nana looked at them through her field glasses. At that distance you could only distinguish a compact, confused mass of people, heaped up, as it were, on the ascending ranges of steps, a dark background relieved by light dots which were human faces. The sunlight filtered in through openings near the roof at each end of the stand and detached and illumined portions of the seated multitude, where the ladies\u0027 dresses seemed to lose their distinguishing colors. But Nana was especially amused by the ladies whom the shower had driven from the rows of chairs ranged on the sand at the base of the stands. As courtesans were absolutely forbidden to enter the enclosure, she began making exceedingly bitter remarks about all the fashionable women therein assembled. She thought them fearfully dressed up, and such guys! \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a rumor that the empress was entering the little central stand, a pavilion built like a chalet, with a wide balcony furnished with red armchairs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, there he is!\" said Georges. \"I didn\u0027t think he was on duty this week.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The stiff and solemn form of the Count Muffat had appeared behind the empress. Thereupon the young men jested and were sorry that Satin wasn\u0027t there to go and dig him in the ribs. But Nana\u0027s field glass focused the head of the Prince of Scots in the imperial stand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gracious, it\u0027s Charles!\" she cried. \\n\\n \\n\\n She thought him stouter than formerly. In eighteen months he had broadened, and with that she entered into particulars. Oh yes, he was a big, solidly built fellow! \\n\\n \\n\\n All round her in the ladies\u0027 carriages they were whispering that the count had given her up. It was quite a long story. Since he had been making himself noticeable, the Tuileries had grown scandalized at the chamberlain\u0027s conduct. Whereupon, in order ro retain his position, he had recently broken it off with Nana. La Faloise bluntly reported this account of matters to the young woman and, addressing her as his Juliet, again offered himself. But she laughed merrily and remarked: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s idiotic! You won\u0027t know him; I\u0027ve only to say, \u0027Come here,\u0027 for him to chuck up everything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For some seconds past she had been examining the Countess Sabine and Estelle. Daguenet was still at their side. Fauchery had just arrived and was disturbing the people round him in his desire to make his bow to them. He, too, stayed smilingly beside them. After that Nana pointed with disdainful action at the stands and continued: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then, you know, those people don\u0027t fetch me any longer now! I know \u0027em too well. You should see \u0027em behind scenes. No more honor! It\u0027s all up with honor! Filth belowstairs, filth abovestairs, filth everywhere. That\u0027s why I won\u0027t be bothered about \u0027em!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And with a comprehensive gesture she took in everybody, from the grooms leading the horses on to the course to the sovereign lady busy chatting with with Charles, a prince and a dirty fellow to boot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bravo, Nana! Awfully smart, Nana!\" cried La Faloise enthusiastically. \\n\\n \\n\\n The tolling of a bell was lost in the wind; the races continued. The Prix d\u0027Ispahan had just been run for and Berlingot, a horse belonging to the Mechain stable, had won. Nana recalled Labordette in order to obtain news of the hundred louis, but he burst out laughing and refused to let her know the horses he had chosen for her, so as not to disturb the luck, as he phrased it. Her money was well placed; she would see that all in good time. And when she confessed her bets to him and told him how she had put ten louis on Lusignan and five on Valerio II, he shrugged his shoulders, as who should say that women did stupid things whatever happened. His action surprised her; she was quite at sea. \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then the field grew more animated than before. Open-air lunches were arranged in the interval before the Grand Prix. There was much eating and more drinking in all directions, on the grass, on the high seats of the four-in-hands and mail coaches, in the victorias, the broughams, the landaus. There was a universal spread of cold viands and a fine disorderly display of champagne baskets which footmen kept handing down out of the coach boots. Corks came out with feeble pops, which the wind drowned. There was an interchange of jests, and the sound of breaking glasses imparted a note of discord to the high-strung gaiety of the scene. Gaga and Clarisse, together with Blanche, were making a serious repast, for they were eating sandwiches on the carriage rug with which they had been covering their knees. Louise Violaine had got down from her basket carriage and had joined Caroline Hequet. On the turf at their feet some gentlemen had instituted a drinking bar, whither Tatan, Maria, Simonne and the rest came to refresh themselves, while high in air and close at hand bottles were being emptied on Lea de Horn\u0027s mail coach, and, with infinite bravado and gesticulation, a whole band were making themselves tipsy in the sunshine, above the heads of the crowd. Soon, however, there was an especially large crowd by Nana\u0027s landau. She had risen to her feet and had set herself to pour out glasses of champagne for the men who came to pay her their respects. Francois, one of the footmen, was passing up the bottles while La Faloise, trying hard to imitate a coster\u0027s accents, kept pattering away: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Ere y\u0027re, given away, given away! There\u0027s some for everybody!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do be still, dear boy,\" Nana ended by saying. \"We look like a set of tumblers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She thought him very droll and was greatly entertained. At one moment she conceived the idea of sending Georges with a glass of champagne to Rose Mignon, who was affecting temperance. Henri and Charles were bored to distraction; they would have been glad of some champagne, the poor little fellows. But Georges drank the glassful, for he feared an argument. Then Nana remembered Louiset, who was sitting forgotten behind her. Maybe he was thirsty, and she forced him to take a drop or two of wine, which made him cough dreadfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Ere y\u0027are, \u0027ere y\u0027are, gemmen!\" La Faloise reiterated. \"It don\u0027t cost two sous; it don\u0027t cost one. We give it away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Nana broke in with an exclamation: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gracious, there\u0027s Bordenave down there! Call him. Oh, run, please, please do!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was indeed Bordenave. He was strolling about with his hands behind his back, wearing a hat that looked rusty in the sunlight and a greasy frock coat that was glossy at the seams. It was Bordenave shattered by bankruptcy, yet furious despite all reverses, a Bordenave who flaunted his misery among all the fine folks with the hardihood becoming a man ever ready to take Dame Fortune by storm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The deuce, how smart we are!\" he said when Nana extended her hand to him like the good-natured wench she was. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently, after emptying a glass of champagne, he gave vent to the followmg profoundly regretful phrase: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, if only I were a woman! But, by God, that\u0027s nothing! Would you like to go on the stage again? I\u0027ve a notion: I\u0027ll hire the Gaite, and we\u0027ll gobble up Paris between us. You certainly owe it me, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he lingered, grumbling, beside her, though glad to see her again; for, he said, that confounded Nana was balm to his feelings. Yes, it was balm to them merely to exist in her presence! She was his daughter; she was blood of his blood! \\n\\n \\n\\n The circle increased, for now La Faloise was filling glasses, and Georges and Philippe were picking up friends. A stealthy impulse was gradually bringing in the whole field. Nana would fling everyone a laughing smile or an amusing phrase. The groups of tipplers were drawing near, and all the champagne scattered over the place was moving in her direction. Soon there was only one noisy crowd, and that was round her landau, where she queened it among outstretched glasses, her yellow hair floating on the breeze and her snowy face bathed in the sunshine. Then by way of a finishing touch and to make the other women, who were mad at her triumph, simply perish of envy, she lifted a brimming glass on high and assumed her old pose as Venus Victrix. \\n\\n \\n\\n But somebody touched her shoulder, and she was surprised, on turning round, to see Mignon on the seat. She vanished from view an instant and sat herself down beside him, for he had come to communicate a matter of importance. Mignon had everywhere declared that it was ridiculous of his wife to bear Nana a grudge; he thought her attitude stupid and useless. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here, my dear,\" he whispered. \"Be careful: don\u0027t madden Rose too much. You understand, I think it best to warn you. Yes, she\u0027s got a weapon in store, and as she\u0027s never forgiven you the Petite Duchesse business--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A weapon,\" said Nana; \"what\u0027s that blooming well got to do with me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just listen: it\u0027s a letter she must have found in Fauchery\u0027s pocket, a letter written to that screw Fauchery by the Countess Muffat. And, by Jove, it\u0027s clear the whole story\u0027s in it. Well then, Rose wants to send the letter to the count so as to be revenged on him and on you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What the deuce has that got to do with me?\" Nana repeated. \"It\u0027s a funny business. So the whole story about Fauchery\u0027s in it! Very well, so much the better; the woman has been exasperating me! We shall have a good laugh!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t wish it,\" Mignon briskly rejoined. \"There\u0027ll be a pretty scandal! Besides, we\u0027ve got nothing to gain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He paused, fearing lest he should say too much, while she loudly averred that she was most certainly not going to get a chaste woman into trouble. \\n\\n \\n\\n But when he still insisted on his refusal she looked steadily at him. Doubtless he was afraid of seeing Fauchery again introduced into his family in case he broke with the countess. While avenging her own wrongs, Rose was anxious for that to happen, since she still felt a kindness toward the journalist. And Nana waxed meditative and thought of M. Venot\u0027s call, and a plan began to take shape in her brain, while Mignon was doing his best to talk her over. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s suppose that Rose sends the letter, eh? There\u0027s food for scandal: you\u0027re mixed up in the business, and people say you\u0027re the cause of it all. Then to begin with, the count separates from his wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should he?\" she said. \"On the contrary--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She broke off, in her turn. There was no need for her to think aloud. So in order to be rid of Mignon she looked as though she entered into his view of the case, and when he advised her to give Rose some proof of her submission--to pay her a short visit on the racecourse, for instance, where everybody would see her--she replied that she would see about it, that she would think the matter over. \\n\\n \\n\\n A commotion caused her to stand up again. On the course the horses were coming in amid a sudden blast of wind. The prize given by the city of Paris had just been run for, and Cornemuse had gained it. Now the Grand Prix was about to be run, and the fever of the crowd increased, and they were tortured by anxiety and stamped and swayed as though they wanted to make the minutes fly faster. At this ultimate moment the betting world was surprised and startled by the continued shortening of the odds against Nana, the outsider of the Vandeuvres stables. Gentlemen kept returning every few moments with a new quotation: the betting was thirty to one against Nana; it was twenty-five to one against Nana, then twenty to one, then fifteen to one. No one could understand it. A filly beaten on all the racecourses! A filly which that same morning no single sportsman would take at fifty to one against! What did this sudden madness betoken? Some laughed at it and spoke of the pretty doing awaiting the duffers who were being taken in by the joke. Others looked serious and uneasy and sniffed out something ugly under it all. Perhaps there was a \"deal\" in the offing. Allusion was made to well-known stories about the robberies which are winked at on racecourses, but on this occasion the great name of Vandeuvres put a stop to all such accusations, and the skeptics in the end prevailed when they prophesied that Nana would come in last of all. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s riding Nana?\" queried La Faloise. \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then the real Nana reappeared, whereat the gentlemen lent his question an indecent meaning and burst into an uproarious fit of laughter. Nana bowed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Price is up,\" she replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n And with that the discussion began again. Price was an English celebrity. Why had Vandeuvres got this jockey to come over, seeing that Gresham ordinarily rode Nana? Besides, they were astonished to see him confiding Lusignan to this man Gresham, who, according to La Faloise, never got a place. But all these remarks were swallowed up in jokes, contradictions and an extraordinarily noisy confusion of opinions. In order to kill time the company once more set themselves to drain bottles of champagne. Presently a whisper ran round, and the different groups opened outward. It was Vandeuvres. Nana affected vexation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear me, you\u0027re a nice fellow to come at this time of day! Why, I\u0027m burning to see the enclosure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, come along then,\" he said; \"there\u0027s still time. You\u0027ll take a stroll round with me. I just happen to have a permit for a lady about me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he led her off on his arm while she enjoyed the jealous glances with which Lucy, Caroline and the others followed her. The young Hugons and La Faloise remained in the landau behind her retreating figure and continued to do the honors of her champagne. She shouted to them that she would return immediately. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Vandeuvres caught sight of Labordette and called him, and there was an interchange of brief sentences. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve scraped everything up?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To what amount?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fifteen hundred louis--pretty well all over the place.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As Nana was visibly listening, and that with much curiosity, they held their tongues. Vandeuvres was very nervous, and he had those same clear eyes, shot with little flames, which so frightened her the night he spoke of burning himself and his horses together. As they crossed over the course she spoke low and familiarly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say, do explain this to me. Why are the odds on your filly changing?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He trembled, and this sentence escaped him: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, they\u0027re talking, are they? What a set those betting men are! When I\u0027ve got the favorite they all throw themselves upon him, and there\u0027s no chance for me. After that, when an outsider\u0027s asked for, they give tongue and yell as though they were being skinned.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You ought to tell me what\u0027s going to happen--I\u0027ve made my bets,\" she reioined. \"Has Nana a chance?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A sudden, unreasonable burst of anger overpowered him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Won\u0027t you deuced well let me be, eh? Every horse has a chance. The odds are shortening because, by Jove, people have taken the horse. Who, I don\u0027t know. I should prefer leaving you if you must needs badger me with your idiotic questions.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Such a tone was not germane either to his temperament or his habits, and Nana was rather surprised than wounded. Besides, he was ashamed of himself directly afterward, and when she begged him in a dry voice to behave politely he apologized. For some time past he had suffered from such sudden changes of temper. No one in the Paris of pleasure or of society was ignorant of the fact that he was playing his last trump card today. If his horses did not win, if, moreover, they lost him the considerable sums wagered upon them, it would mean utter disaster and collapse for him, and the bulwark of his credit and the lofty appearance which, though undermined, he still kept up, would come ruining noisily down. Moreover, no one was ignorant of the fact that Nana was the devouring siren who had finished him off, who had been the last to attack his crumbling fortunes and to sweep up what remained of them. Stories were told of wild whims and fancies, of gold scattered to the four winds, of a visit to Baden-Baden, where she had not left him enough to pay the hotel bill, of a handful of diamonds cast on the fire during an evening of drunkenness in order to see whether they would burn like coal. Little by little her great limbs and her coarse, plebeian way of laughing had gained complete mastery over this elegant, degenerate son of an ancient race. At that time he was risking his all, for he had been so utterly overpowered by his taste for ordure and stupidity as to have even lost the vigor of his skepticism. A week before Nana had made him promise her a chateau on the Norman coast between Havre and Trouville, and now he was staking the very foundations of his honor on the fulfillment of his word. Only she was getting on his nerves, and he could have beaten her, so stupid did he feel her to be. \\n\\n \\n\\n The man at the gate, not daring to stop the woman hanging on the count\u0027s arm, had allowed them to enter the enclosure. Nana, greatly puffed up at the thought that at last she was setting foot on the forbidden ground, put on her best behavior and walked slowly by the ladies seated at the foot of the stands. On ten rows of chairs the toilets were densely massed, and in the blithe open air their bright colors mingled harmoniously. Chairs were scattered about, and as people met one another friendly circles were formed, just as though the company had been sitting under the trees in a public garden. Children had been allowed to go free and were running from group to group, while over head the stands rose tier above crowded tier and the light-colored dresses therein faded into the delicate shadows of the timberwork. Nana stared at all these ladies. She stared steadily and markedly at the Countess Sabine. After which, as she was passing in front of the imperial stand, the sight of Muffat, looming in all his official stiffness by the side of the empress, made her very merry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, how silly he looks!\" she said at the top of her voice to Vandeuvres. She was anxious to pay everything a visit. This small parklike region, with its green lawns and groups of trees, rather charmed her than otherwise. A vendor of ices had set up a large buffet near the entrance gates, and beneath a rustic thatched roof a dense throng of people were shouting and gesticulating. This was the ring. Close by were some empty stalls, and Nana was disappointed at discovering only a gendarme\u0027s horse there. Then there was the paddock, a small course some hundred meters in circumference, where a stable help was walking about Valerio II in his horsecloths. And, oh, what a lot of men on the graveled sidewalks, all of them with their tickets forming an orange-colored patch in their bottonholes! And what a continual parade of people in the open galleries of the grandstands! The scene interested her for a moment or two, but truly, it was not worth while getting the spleen because they didn\u0027t admit you inside here. \\n\\n \\n\\n Daguenet and Fauchery passed by and bowed to her. She made them a sign, and they had to come up. Thereupon she made hay of the weighing-in enclosure. But she broke off abruptly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear me, there\u0027s the Marquis de Chouard! How old he\u0027s growing! That old man\u0027s killing himself! Is he still as mad about it as ever?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Thereupon Daguenet described the old man\u0027s last brilliant stroke. The story dated from the day before yesterday, and no one knew it as yet. After dangling about for months he had bought her daughter Amelie from Gaga for thirty thousand francs, they said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good gracious! That\u0027s a nice business!\" cried Nana in disgust. \"Go in for the regular thing, please! But now that I come to think of it, that must be Lili down there on the grass with a lady in a brougham. I recognized the face. The old boy will have brought her out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Vandeuvres was not listening; he was impatient and longed to get rid of her. But Fauchery having remarked at parting that if she had not seen the bookmakers she had seen nothing, the count was obliged to take her to them in spite of his obvious repugnance. And she was perfectly happy at once; that truly was a curious sight, she said! \\n\\n \\n\\n Amid lawns bordered by young horse-chestnut trees there was a round open enclosure, where, forming a vast circle under the shadow of the tender green leaves, a dense line of bookmakers was waiting for betting men, as though they had been hucksters at a fair. In order to overtop and command the surrounding crowd they had taken up positions on wooden benches, and they were advertising their prices on the trees beside them. They had an ever-vigilant glance, and they booked wagers in answer to a single sign, a mere wink, so rapidly that certain curious onlookers watched them openmouthed, without being able to understand it all. Confusion reigned; prices were shouted, and any unexpected change in a quotation was received with something like tumult. Occasionally scouts entered the place at a run and redoubled the uproar as they stopped at the entrance to the rotunda and, at the tops of their voices, announced departures and arrivals. In this place, where the gambling fever was pulsing in the sunshine, such announcements were sure to raise a prolonged muttering sound. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They ARE funny!\" murmured Nana, greatly entertained. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Their features look as if they had been put on the wrong way. Just you see that big fellow there; I shouldn\u0027t care to meet him all alone in the middle of a wood.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Vandeuvres pointed her out a bookmaker, once a shopman in a fancy repository, who had made three million francs in two years. He was slight of build, delicate and fair, and people all round him treated him with great respect. They smiled when they addressed him, while others took up positions close by in order to catch a glimpse of him. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were at length leaving the ring when Vandeuvres nodded slightly to another bookmaker, who thereupon ventured to call him. It was one of his former coachmen, an enormous fellow with the shoulders of an ox and a high color. Now that he was trying his fortunes at race meetings on the strength of some mysteriously obtained capital, the count was doing his utmost to push him, confiding to him his secret bets and treating him on all occasions as a servant to whom one shows one\u0027s true character. Yet despite this protection, the man had in rapid succession lost very heavy sums, and today he, too, was playing his last card. There was blood in his eyes; he looked fit to drop with apoplexy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Marechal,\" queried the count in the lowest of voices, \"to what amount have you laid odds?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To five thousand louis, Monsieur le Comte,\" replied the bookmaker, likewise lowering his voice. \"A pretty job, eh? I\u0027ll confess to you that I\u0027ve increased the odds; I\u0027ve made it three to one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Vandeuvres looked very much put out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no, I don\u0027t want you to do that. Put it at two to one again directly. I shan\u0027t tell you any more, Marechal.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, how can it hurt, Monsieur le Comte, at this time o\u0027 day?\" rejoined the other with the humble smile befitting an accomplice. \"I had to attract the people so as to lay your two thousand louis.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this Vandeuvres silenced him. But as he was going off Marechal remembered something and was sorry he had not questioned him about the shortening of the odds on the filly. It would be a nice business for him if the filly stood a chance, seeing that he had just laid fifty to one about her in two hundreds. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nana, though she did not understand a word of what the count was whispering, dared not, however, ask for new explanations. He seemed more nervous than before and abruptly handed her over to Labordette, whom they came upon in front of the weighing-in room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll take her back,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got something on hand. Au revoir!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he entered the room, which was narrow and low-pitched and half filled with a great pair of scales. It was like a waiting room in a suburban station, and Nana was again hugely disillusioned, for she had been picturing to herself something on a very vast scale, a monumental machine, in fact, for weighing horses. Dear me, they only weighed the jockeys! Then it wasn\u0027t worth while making such a fuss with their weighing! In the scale a jockey with an idiotic expression was waiting, harness on knee, till a stout man in a frock coat should have done verifying his weight. At the door a stable help was holding a horse, Cosinus, round which a silent and deeply interested throng was clustering. \\n\\n \\n\\n The course was about to be cleared. Labordette hurried Nana but retraced his steps in order to show her a little man talking with Vandeuvres at some distance from the rest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear me, there\u0027s Price!\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah yes, the man who\u0027s mounting me,\" she murmured laughingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n And she declared him to be exquisitely ugly. All jockeys struck her as looking idiotic, doubtless, she said, because they were prevented from growing bigger. This particular jockey was a man of forty, and with his long, thin, deeply furrowed, hard, dead countenance, he looked like an old shriveled-up child. His body was knotty and so reduced in size that his blue jacket with its white sleeves looked as if it had been thrown over a lay figure. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" she resumed as she walked away, \"he would never make me very happy, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A mob of people were still crowding the course, the turf of which had been wet and trampled on till it had grown black. In front of the two telegraphs, which hung very high up on their cast-iron pillars, the crowd were jostling together with upturned faces, uproariously greeting the numbers of the different horses as an electric wire in connection with the weighing room made them appear. Gentlemen were pointing at programs: Pichenette had been scratched by his owner, and this caused some noise. However, Nana did not do more than cross over the course on Labordette\u0027s arm. The bell hanging on the flagstaff was ringing persistently to warn people to leave the course. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, my little dears,\" she said as she got up into her landau again, \"their enclosure\u0027s all humbug!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She was welcomed with acclamation; people around her clapped their hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bravo, Nana! Nana\u0027s ours again!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n What idiots they were, to be sure! Did they think she was the sort to cut old friends? She had come back just at the auspicious moment. Now then, \u0027tenshun! The race was beginning! And the champagne was accordingly forgotten, and everyone left off drinking. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Nana was astonished to find Gaga in her carriage, sitting with Bijou and Louiset on her knees. Gaga had indeed decided on this course of action in order to be near La Faloise, but she told Nana that she had been anxious to kiss Baby. She adored children. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By the by, what about Lili?\" asked Nana. \"That\u0027s certainly she over there in that old fellow\u0027s brougham. They\u0027ve just told me something very nice!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gaga had adopted a lachrymose expression. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear, it\u0027s made me ill,\" she said dolorously. \"Yesterday I had to keep my bed, I cried so, and today I didn\u0027t think I should be able to come. You know what my opinions were, don\u0027t you? I didn\u0027t desire that kind of thing at all. I had her educated in a convent with a view to a good marriage. And then to think of the strict advice she had and the constant watching! Well, my dear, it was she who wished it. We had such a scene--tears--disagreeable speeches! It even got to such a point that I caught her a box on the ear. She was too much bored by existence, she said; she wanted to get out of it. By and by, when she began to say, \u0027\u0027Tisn\u0027t you, after all, who\u0027ve got the right to prevent me,\u0027 I said to her: \u0027you\u0027re a miserable wretch; you\u0027re bringing dishonor upon us. Begone!\u0027 And it was done. I consented to arrange about it. But my last hope\u0027s blooming well blasted, and, oh, I used to dream about such nice things!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The noise of a quarrel caused them to rise. It was Georges in the act of defending Vandeuvres against certain vague rumors which were circulating among the various groups. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should you say that he\u0027s laying off his own horse?\" the young man was exclaiming. \"Yesterday in the Salon des Courses he took the odds on Lusignan for a thousand louis.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I was there,\" said Philippe in affirmation of this. \"And he didn\u0027t put a single louis on Nana. If the betting\u0027s ten to one against Nana he\u0027s got nothing to win there. It\u0027s absurd to imagine people are so calculating. Where would his interest come in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Labordette was listening with a quiet expression. Shrugging his shoulders, he said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, leave them alone; they must have their say. The count has again laid at least as much as five hundred louis on Lusignan, and if he\u0027s wanted Nana to run to a hundred louis it\u0027s because an owner ought always to look as if he believes in his horses.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, bosh! What the deuce does that matter to us?\" shouted La Faloise with a wave of his arms. \"Spirit\u0027s going to win! Down with France--bravo, England!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A long shiver ran through the crowd, while a fresh peal from the bell announced the arrival of the horses upon the racecourse. At this Nana got up and stood on one of the seats of her carriage so as to obtain a better view, and in so doing she trampled the bouquets of roses and myosotis underfoot. With a sweeping glance she took in the wide, vast horizon. At this last feverish moment the course was empty and closed by gray barriers, between the posts of which stood a line of policemen. The strip of grass which lay muddy in front of her grew brighter as it stretched away and turned into a tender green carpet in the distance. In the middle landscape, as she lowered her eyes, she saw the field swarming with vast numbers of people, some on tiptoe, others perched on carriages, and all heaving and jostling in sudden passionate excitement. \\n\\n \\n\\n Horses were neighing; tent canvases flapped, while equestrians urged their hacks forward amid a crowd of pedestrians rushing to get places along the barriers. When Nana turned in the direction of the stands on the other side the faces seemed diminished, and the dense masses of heads were only a confused and motley array, filling gangways, steps and terraces and looming in deep, dark, serried lines against the sky. And beyond these again she over looked the plain surrounding the course. Behind the ivy-clad mill to the right, meadows, dotted over with great patches of umbrageous wood, stretched away into the distance, while opposite to her, as far as the Seine flowing at the foot of a hill, the avenues of the park intersected one another, filled at that moment with long, motionless files of waiting carriages; and in the direction of Boulogne, on the left, the landscape widened anew and opened out toward the blue distances of Meudon through an avenue of paulownias, whose rosy, leafless tops were one stain of brilliant lake color. People were still arriving, and a long procession of human ants kept coming along the narrow ribbon of road which crossed the distance, while very far away, on the Paris side, the nonpaying public, herding like sheep among the wood, loomed in a moving line of little dark spots under the trees on the skirts of the Bois. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly a cheering influence warmed the hundred thousand souls who covered this part of the plain like insects swarming madly under the vast expanse of heaven. The sun, which had been hidden for about a quarter of an hour, made his appearance again and shone out amid a perfect sea of light. And everything flamed afresh: the women\u0027s sunshades turned into countless golden targets above the heads of the crowd. The sun was applauded, saluted with bursts of laughter. And people stretched their arms out as though to brush apart the clouds. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile a solitary police officer advanced down the middle of the deserted racecourse, while higher up, on the left, a man appeared with a red flag in his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s the starter, the Baron de Mauriac,\" said Labordette in reply to a question from Nana. All round the young woman exclamations were bursting from the men who were pressing to her very carriage step. They kept up a disconnected conversation, jerking out phrases under the immediate influence of passing impressions. Indeed, Philippe and Georges, Bordenave and La Faloise, could not be quiet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t shove! Let me see! Ah, the judge is getting into his box. D\u0027you say it\u0027s Monsieur de Souvigny? You must have good eyesight--eh?--to be able to tell what half a head is out of a fakement like that! Do hold your tongue--the banner\u0027s going up. Here they are--\u0027tenshun! Cosinus is the first!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A red and yellow banner was flapping in mid-air at the top of a mast. The horses came on the course one by one; they were led by stableboys, and the jockeys were sitting idle-handed in the saddles, the sunlight making them look like bright dabs of color. After Cosinus appeared Hazard and Boum. Presently a murmur of approval greeted Spirit, a magnificent big brown bay, the harsh citron color and black of whose jockey were cheerlessly Britannic. Valerio II scored a success as he came in; he was small and very lively, and his colors were soft green bordered with pink. The two Vandeuvres horses were slow to make their appearance, but at last, in Frangipane\u0027s rear, the blue and white showed themselves. But Lusignan, a very dark bay of irreproachable shape, was almost forgotten amid the astonishment caused by Nana. People had not seen her looking like this before, for now the sudden sunlight was dyeing the chestnut filly the brilliant color of a girl\u0027s red-gold hair. She was shining in the light like a new gold coin; her chest was deep; her head and neck tapered lightly from the delicate, high-strung line of her long back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gracious, she\u0027s got my hair!\" cried Nana in an ecstasy. \"You bet you know I\u0027m proud of it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The men clambered up on the landau, and Bordenave narrowly escaped putting his foot on Louiset, whom his mother had forgotten. He took him up with an outburst of paternal grumbling and hoisted him on his shoulder, muttering at the same time: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The poor little brat, he must be in it too! Wait a bit, I\u0027ll show you Mamma. Eh? Look at Mummy out there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And as Bijou was scratching his legs, he took charge of him, too, while Nana, rejoicing in the brute that bore her name, glanced round at the other women to see how they took it. They were all raging madly. Just then on the summit of her cab the Tricon, who had not moved till that moment, began waving her hand and giving her bookmaker her orders above the heads of the crowd. Her instinct had at last prompted her; she was backing Nana. \\n\\n \\n\\n La Faloise meanwhile was making an insufferable noise. He was getting wild over Frangipane. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve an inspiration,\" he kept shouting. \"Just look at Frangipane. What an action, eh? I back Frangipane at eight to one. Who\u0027ll take me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do keep quiet now,\" said Labordette at last. \"You\u0027ll be sorry for it if you do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Frangipane\u0027s a screw,\" Philippe declared. \"He\u0027s been utterly blown upon already. You\u0027ll see the canter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The horses had gone up to the right, and they now started for the preliminary canter, passing in loose order before the stands. Thereupon there was a passionate fresh burst of talk, and people all spoke at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lusignan\u0027s too long in the back, but he\u0027s very fit. Not a cent, I tell you, on Valerio II; he\u0027s nervous--gallops with his head up--it\u0027s a bad sign. Jove! Burne\u0027s riding Spirit. I tell you, he\u0027s got no shoulders. A well-made shoulder--that\u0027s the whole secret. No, decidedly, Spirit\u0027s too quiet. Now listen, Nana, I saw her after the Grande Poule des Produits, and she was dripping and draggled, and her sides were trembling like one o\u0027clock. I lay twenty louis she isn\u0027t placed! Oh, shut up! He\u0027s boring us with his Frangipane. There\u0027s no time to make a bet now; there, they\u0027re off!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Almost in tears, La Faloise was struggling to find a bookmaker. He had to be reasoned with. Everyone craned forward, but the first go-off was bad, the starter, who looked in the distance like a slim dash of blackness, not having lowered his flag. The horses came back to their places after galloping a moment or two. There were two more false starts. At length the starter got the horses together and sent them away with such address as to elicit shouts of applause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Splendid! No, it was mere chance! Never mind--it\u0027s done it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The outcries were smothered by the anxiety which tortured every breast. The betting stopped now, and the game was being played on the vast course itself. Silence reigned at the outset, as though everyone were holding his breath. White faces and trembling forms were stretched forward in all directions. At first Hazard and Cosinus made the running at the head of the rest; Valerio II followed close by, and the field came on in a confused mass behind. When they passed in front of the stands, thundering over the ground in their course like a sudden stormwind, the mass was already some fourteen lengths in extent. Frangipane was last, and Nana was slightly behind Lusignan and Spirit. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Egad!\" muttered Labordette, \"how the Englishman is pulling it off out there!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The whole carriageload again burst out with phrases and exclamations. Everyone rose on tiptoe and followed the bright splashes of color which were the jockeys as they rushed through the sunlight. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the rise Valerio II took the lead, while Cosinus and Hazard lost ground, and Lusignan and Spirit were running neck and neck with Nana still behind them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By jingo, the Englishman\u0027s gained! It\u0027s palpable!\" said Bordenave. \"Lusignan\u0027s in difficulties, and Valerio II can\u0027t stay.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it will be a pretty biz if the Englishman wins!\" cried Philippe in an access of patriotic grief. \\n\\n \\n\\n A feeling of anguish was beginning to choke all that crowded multitude. Another defeat! And with that a strange ardent prayer, which was almost religious, went up for Lusignan, while people heaped abuse on Spirit and his dismal mute of a jockey. Among the crowd scattered over the grass the wind of excitement put up whole groups of people and set their boot soles flashing in air as they ran. Horsemen crossed the green at a furious gallop. And Nana, who was slowly revolving on her own axis, saw beneath her a surging waste of beasts and men, a sea of heads swayed and stirred all round the course by the whirlwind of the race, which clove the horizon with the bright lightning flash of the jockeys. She had been following their movement from behind while the cruppers sped away and the legs seemed to grow longer as they raced and then diminished till they looked slender as strands of hair. Now the horses were running at the end of the course, and she caught a side view of them looking minute and delicate of outline against the green distances of the Bois. Then suddenly they vanished behind a great clump of trees growing in the middle of the Hippodrome. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t talk about it!\" cried Georges, who was still full of hope. \"It isn\u0027t over yet. The Englishman\u0027s touched.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But La Faloise was again seized with contempt for his country and grew positively outrageous in his applause of Spirit. Bravo! That was right! France needed it! Spirit first and Frangipane second--that would be a nasty one for his native land! He exasperated Labordette, who threatened seriously to throw him off the carriage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s see how many minutes they\u0027ll be about it,\" said Bordenave peaceably, for though holding up Louiset, he had taken out his watch. \\n\\n \\n\\n One after the other the horses reappeared from behind the clump of trees. There was stupefaction; a long murmur arose among the crowd. Valerio II was still leading, but Spirit was gaining on him, and behind him Lusignan had slackened while another horse was taking his place. People could not make this out all at once; they were confused about the colors. Then there was a burst of exclamations. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it\u0027s Nana! Nana? Get along! I tell you Lusignan hasn\u0027t budged. Dear me, yes, it\u0027s Nana. You can certainly recognize her by her golden color. D\u0027you see her now? She\u0027s blazing away. Bravo, Nana! What a ripper she is! Bah, it doesn\u0027t matter a bit: she\u0027s making the running for Lusignan!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For some seconds this was everybody\u0027s opinion. But little by little the filly kept gaining and gaining, spurting hard all the while. Thereupon a vast wave of feeling passed over the crowd, and the tail of horses in the rear ceased to interest. A supreme struggle was beginning between Spirit, Nana, Lusignan and Valerio II. They were pointed out; people estimated what ground they had gained or lost in disconnected, gasping phrases. And Nana, who had mounted up on the coach box, as though some power had lifted her thither, stood white and trembling and so deeply moved as not to be able to speak. At her side Labordette smiled as of old. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Englishman\u0027s in trouble, eh?\" said Philippe joyously. \"He\u0027s going badly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In any case, it\u0027s all up with Lusignan,\" shouted La Faloise. \"Valerio II is coming forward. Look, there they are all four together.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The same phrase was in every mouth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What a rush, my dears! By God, what a rush!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The squad of horses was now passing in front of them like a flash of lightning. Their approach was perceptible--the breath of it was as a distant muttering which increased at every second. The whole crowd had thrown themselves impetuously against the barriers, and a deep clamor issued from innumerable chests before the advance of the horses and drew nearer and nearer like the sound of a foaming tide. It was the last fierce outburst of colossal partisanship; a hundred thousand spectators were possessed by a single passion, burning with the same gambler\u0027s lust, as they gazed after the beasts, whose galloping feet were sweeping millions with them. The crowd pushed and crushed--fists were clenched; people gaped, openmouthed; every man was fighting for himself; every man with voice and gesture was madly speeding the horse of his choice. And the cry of all this multitude, a wild beast\u0027s cry despite the garb of civilization, grew ever more distinct: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here they come! Here they come! Here they come!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Nana was still gaining ground, and now Valerio II was distanced, and she was heading the race, with Spirit two or three necks behind. The rolling thunder of voices had increased. They were coming in; a storm of oaths greeted them from the landau. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gee up, Lusignan, you great coward! The Englishman\u0027s stunning! Do it again, old boy; do it again! Oh, that Valerio! It\u0027s sickening! Oh, the carcass! My ten louis damned well lost! Nana\u0027s the only one! Bravo, Nana! Bravo!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And without being aware of it Nana, upon her seat, had begun jerking her hips and waist as though she were racing herself. She kept striking her side--she fancied it was a help to the filly. With each stroke she sighed with fatigue and said in low, anguished tones: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go it, go it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then a splendid sight was witnessed. Price, rising in his stirrups and brandishing his whip, flogged Nana with an arm of iron. The old shriveled-up child with his long, hard, dead face seemed to breath flame. And in a fit of furious audacity and triumphant will he put his heart into the filly, held her up, lifted her forward, drenched in foam, with eyes of blood. The whole rush of horses passed with a roar of thunder: it took away people\u0027s breaths; it swept the air with it while the judge sat frigidly waiting, his eye adjusted to its task. Then there was an immense re-echoing burst of acclamation. With a supreme effort Price had just flung Nana past the post, thus beating Spirit by a head. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was an uproar as of a rising tide. \"Nana! Nana! Nana!\" The cry rolled up and swelled with the violence of a tempest, till little by little it filled the distance, the depths of the Bois as far as Mont Valerien, the meadows of Longchamps and the Plaine de Boulogne. In all parts of the field the wildest enthusiasm declared itself. \"Vive Nana! Vive la France! Down with England!\" The women waved their sunshades; men leaped and spun round, vociferating as they did so, while others with shouts of nervous laughter threw their hats in the air. And from the other side of the course the enclosure made answer; the people on the stands were stirred, though nothing was distinctly visible save a tremulous motion of the air, as though an invisible flame were burning in a brazier above the living mass of gesticulating arms and little wildly moving faces, where the eyes and gaping mouths looked like black dots. The noise did not cease but swelled up and recommenced in the recesses of faraway avenues and among the people encamped under the trees, till it spread on and on and attained its climax in the imperial stand, where the empress herself had applauded. \"Nana! Nana! Nana!\" The cry rose heavenward in the glorious sunlight, whose golden rain beat fiercely on the dizzy heads of the multitude. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Nana, looming large on the seat of her landau, fancied that it was she whom they were applauding. For a moment or two she had stood devoid of motion, stupefied by her triumph, gazing at the course as it was invaded by so dense a flood of people that the turf became invisible beneath the sea of black hats. By and by, when this crowd had become somewhat less disorderly and a lane had been formed as far as the exit and Nana was again applauded as she went off with Price hanging lifelessly and vacantly over her neck, she smacked her thigh energetically, lost all self-possession, triumphed in crude phrases: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, by God, it\u0027s me; it\u0027s me. Oh, by God, what luck!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And, scarce knowing how to give expression to her overwhelming joy, she hugged and kissed Louiset, whom she now discovered high in the air on Bordenave\u0027s shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Three minutes and fourteen seconds,\" said the latter as he put his watch back in his pocket. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nana kept hearing her name; the whole plain was echoing it back to her. Her people were applauding her while she towered above them in the sunlight, in the splendor of her starry hair and white-and-sky-blue dress. Labordette, as he made off, had just announced to her a gain of two thousand louis, for he had put her fifty on Nana at forty to one. But the money stirred her less than this unforeseen victory, the fame of which made her queen of Paris. All the other ladies were losers. With a raging movement Rose Mignon had snapped her sunshade, and Caroline Hequet and Clarisse and Simonne--nay, Lucy Stewart herself, despite the presence of her son--were swearing low in their exasperation at that great wench\u0027s luck, while the Tricon, who had made the sign of the cross at both start and finish, straightened up her tall form above them, went into an ecstasy over her intuition and damned Nana admiringly as became an experienced matron. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile round the landau the crush of men increased. The band of Nana\u0027s immediate followers had made a fierce uproar, and now Georges, choking with emotion, continued shouting all by himself in breaking tones. As the champagne had given out, Philippe, taking the footmen with him, had run to the wine bars. Nana\u0027s court was growing and growing, and her present triumph caused many loiterers to join her. Indeed, that movement which had made her carriage a center of attraction to the whole field was now ending in an apotheosis, and Queen Venus was enthroned amid suddenly maddened subjects. Bordenave, behind her, was muttering oaths, for he yearned to her as a father. Steiner himself had been reconquered--he had deserted Simonne and had hoisted himself upon one of Nana\u0027s carriage steps. When the champagne had arrived, when she lifted her brimming glass, such applause burst forth, and \"Nana! Nana! Nana!\" was so loudly repeated that the crowd looked round in astonishment for the filly, nor could any tell whether it was the horse or the woman that filled all hearts. \\n\\n \\n\\n While this was going on Mignon came hastening up in defiance of Rose\u0027s terrible frown. That confounded girl simply maddened him, and he wanted to kiss her. Then after imprinting a paternal salute on both her cheeks: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What bothers me,\" he said, \"is that now Rose is certainly going to send the letter. She\u0027s raging, too, fearfully.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So much the better! It\u0027ll do my business for me!\" Nana let slip. \\n\\n \\n\\n But noting his utter astonishment, she hastily continued: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no, what am I saying? Indeed, I don\u0027t rightly know what I\u0027m saying now! I\u0027m drunk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And drunk, indeed, drunk with joy, drunk with sunshine, she still raised her glass on high and applauded herself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To Nana! To Nana!\" she cried amid a redoubled uproar of laughter and bravoes, which little by little overspread the whole Hippodrome. \\n\\n \\n\\n The races were ending, and the Prix Vaublanc was run for. Carriages began driving off one by one. Meanwhile, amid much disputing, the name of Vandeuvres was again mentioned. It was quite evident now: for two years past Vandeuvres had been preparing his final stroke and had accordingly told Gresham to hold Nana in, while he had only brought Lusignan forward in order to make play for the filly. The losers were vexed; the winners shrugged their shoulders. After all, wasn\u0027t the thing permissible? An owner was free to run his stud in his own way. Many others had done as he had! In fact, the majority thought Vandeuvres had displayed great skill in raking in all he could get about Nana through the agency of friends, a course of action which explained the sudden shortening of the odds. People spoke of his having laid two thousand louis on the horse, which, supposing the odds to be thirty to one against, gave him twelve hundred thousand francs, an amount so vast as to inspire respect and to excuse everything. \\n\\n \\n\\n But other rumors of a very serious nature were being whispered about: they issued in the first instance from the enclosure, and the men who returned thence were full of exact particulars. Voices were raised; an atrocious scandal began to be openly canvassed. That poor fellow Vandeuvres was done for; he had spoiled his splendid hit with a piece of flat stupidity, an idiotic robbery, for he had commissioned Marechal, a shady bookmaker, to lay two thousand louis on his account against Lusignan, in order thereby to get back his thousand and odd openly wagered louis. It was a miserable business, and it proved to be the last rift necessary to the utter breakup of his fortune. The bookmaker being thus warned that the favorite would not win, had realized some sixty thousand francs over the horse. Only Labordette, for lack of exact and detailed instructions, had just then gone to him to put two hundred louis on Nana, which the bookmaker, in his ignorance of the stroke actually intended, was still quoting at fifty to one against. Cleared of one hundred thousand francs over the filly and a loser to the tune of forty thousand, Marechal, who felt the world crumbling under his feet, had suddenly divined the situation when he saw the count and Labordette talking together in front of the enclosure just after the race was over. Furious, as became an ex-coachman of the count\u0027s, and brutally frank as only a cheated man can be, he had just made a frightful scene in public, had told the whole story in atrocious terms and had thrown everyone into angry excitement. It was further stated that the stewards were about to meet. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nana, whom Philippe and Georges were whisperingly putting in possession of the facts, gave vent to a series of reflections and yet ceased not to laugh and drink. After all, it was quite likely; she remembered such things, and then that Marechal had a dirty, hangdog look. Nevertheless, she was still rather doubtful when Labordette appeared. He was very white. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" she asked in a low voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bloody well smashed up!\" he replied simply. \\n\\n \\n\\n And he shrugged his shoulders. That Vandeuvres was a mere child! She made a bored little gesture. \\n\\n \\n\\n That evening at the Bal Mabille Nana obtained a colossal success. When toward ten o\u0027clock she made her appearance, the uproar was afready formidable. That classic night of madness had brought together all that was young and pleasure loving, and now this smart world was wallowing in the coarseness and imbecility of the servants\u0027 hall. There was a fierce crush under the festoons of gas lamps, and men in evening coats and women in outrageous low-necked old toilets, which they did not mind soiling, were howling and surging to and fro under the maddening influence of a vast drunken fit. At a distance of thirty paces the brass instruments of the orchestra were inaudible. Nobody was dancing. Stupid witticisms, repeated no one knew why, were going the round of the various groups. People were straining after wit without succeeding in being funny. Seven women, imprisoned in the cloakroom, were crying to be set free. A shallot had been found, put up to auction and knocked down at two louis. Just then Nana arrived, still wearing her blue-and-white racecourse costume, and amid a thunder of applause the shallot was presented to her. People caught hold of her in her own despite, and three gentlemen bore her triumphantly into the garden, across ruined grassplots and ravaged masses of greenery. As the bandstand presented an obstacle to her advance, it was taken by storm, and chairs and music stands were smashed. A paternal police organized the disorder. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was only on Tuesday that Nana recovered from the excitements of victory. That morning she was chatting with Mme Lerat, the old lady having come in to bring her news of Louiset, whom the open air had upset. A long story, which was occupying the attention of all Paris, interested her beyond measure. Vandeuvres, after being warned off all racecourses and posted at the Cercle Imperial on the very evening after the disaster, had set fire to his stable on the morrow and had burned himself and his horses to death. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He certainly told me he was going to,\" the young woman kept saying. \"That man was a regular maniac! Oh, how they did frighten me when they told me about it yesterday evening! You see, he might easily have murdered me some fine night. And besides, oughtn\u0027t he to have given me a hint about his horse? I should at any rate have made my fortune! He said to Labordette that if I knew about the matter I would immediately inform my hairdresser and a whole lot of other men. How polite, eh? Oh dear, no, I certainly can\u0027t grieve much for him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n After some reflection she had grown very angry. Just then Labordette came in; he had seen about her bets and was now the bearer of some forty thousand francs. This only added to her bad temper, for she ought to have gained a million. Labordette, who during the whole of this episode had been pretending entire innocence, abandoned Vandeuvres in decisive terms. Those old families, he opined, were worn out and apt to make a stupid ending. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh dear no!\" said Nana. \"It isn\u0027t stupid to burn oneself in one\u0027s stable as he did. For my part, I think he made a dashing finish; but, oh, you know, I\u0027m not defending that story about him and Marechal. It\u0027s too silly. Just to think that Blanche has had the cheek to want to lay the blame of it on me! I said to her: \u0027Did I tell him to steal?\u0027 Don\u0027t you think one can ask a man for money without urging him to commit crime? If he had said to me, \u0027I\u0027ve got nothing left,\u0027 I should have said to him, \u0027All right, let\u0027s part.\u0027 And the matter wouldn\u0027t have gone further.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just so,\" said the aunt gravely \"When men are obstinate about a thing, so much the worse for them!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But as to the merry little finish up, oh, that was awfully smart!\" continued Nana. \"It appears to have been terrible enough to give you the shudders! He sent everybody away and boxed himself up in the place with a lot of petroleum. And it blazed! You should have seen it! Just think, a great big affair, almost all made of wood and stuffed with hay and straw! The flames simply towered up, and the finest part of the business was that the horses didn\u0027t want to be roasted. They could be heard plunging, throwing themselves against the doors, crying aloud just like human beings. Yes, people haven\u0027t got rid of the horror of it yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Labordette let a low, incredulous whistle escape him. For his part, he did not believe in the death of Vandeuvres. Somebody had sworn he had seen him escaping through a window. He had set fire to his stable in a fit of aberration, but when it had begun to grow too warm it must have sobered him. A man so besotted about the women and so utterly worn out could not possibly die so pluckily. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nana listened in her disillusionment and could only remark: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, the poor wretch, it was so beautiful!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 六月份的一个星期日，天气刚开始炎热，天空昏昏暗暗，一场暴风雨就要来临，巴黎的跑马大奖赛正在布洛涅森林举行。清晨，太阳在橙黄色的尘雾中升起。但是，快到十一点钟，马车都到了隆尚赛马场时，骤然刮起一阵南风，把乌云驱散了；灰蒙蒙的雾霭散成长长的碎片，随风飘去，蓝莹莹的云隙不断伸扩开来，染蓝了整个天空。阳光从两片云彩之间照射下来，照在赛马场上，把一切照得金光灿烂。草地上渐渐挤满了马车、骑师和行人，但跑道上仍然阒无一人，只有裁判员的岗亭、终点标志杆和用于挂赛马成绩表的柱子。对面，在骑师体重测量处的围墙中央，有五座对称的观众看台，看台是用砖头和木架搭成的，其形状颇像长廊。赛马场外面，一片广阔的平地沐浴着中午阳光，周围长着小树，西边是长满树木的圣克鲁山丘和絮伦山丘，背后耸立着瓦莱莲峰。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜兴致盎然，仿佛大奖赛要决定她的命运似的，她一心要坐在终点标志杆旁边紧靠栅栏的地方观看。她很早就来了，是到得最早的观众之一。她是乘坐一辆镶银的双篷四轮马车来的，由四匹雪白骏马拉着，这辆车是缪法伯爵作为礼物赠送给她的。当她到达草坪入口处时，骑在左边两匹马上的两名车夫驾车疾驶，两个跟班站在车子后部一动不动，这时人群中你推我搡，人人竞相观看，就像王后经过那里似的。她穿的服装是旺德夫尔赛马服的两种颜色，即蓝色和白色，显得非常别致，蓝绸短上衣和蓝绸紧身褡紧紧绷在身上，腰后高高凸起一个裙撑，这样，大腿的轮廓被明显衬托出来，当时流行穿宽大裙子，这样的穿戴打扮是不落俗套的；外面套一件白缎子长裙，袖子也是白缎子的，肩上披着一条白缎子三角围巾，全身穿戴都镶着银色镂空花边，被阳光照得闪闪烁烁。此外，为了使自己更像骑师的样子，她又大胆地在发髻上戴上一顶蓝色无边女帽，帽上插一根白翎毛，发髻上的一缕缕金发垂挂到背上，酷似红棕色马的长长尾巴。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 十二点钟敲响了。还要等三个多小时，跑马大奖赛才能开始。娜娜的双篷四轮马车靠栅栏边停放后，她就像在家里一样自由自在。她一时心血来潮，竟把小狗珍宝和小路易也带来了。小狗躺在她的裙子里，虽然天气很热，还冷得哆哆嗦嗦；孩子身上披着彩带和花边，样子挺有趣，一声不吭，一张可怜的蜡黄小脸被风吹得变得苍白。而娜娜旁若无人，高声与乔治和菲利普谈话，兄弟两人坐在娜娜对面的一张长凳上，两旁是一束束白玫瑰和蓝色勿忘我，花堆放得与他们的肩膀一样高。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “唉！”她说道，“他把我烦死了，我就把他赶出去了……已经两天了，他还在生我的气呢。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她说的是缪法，不过她没有对于贡兄弟说出他们第一次口角的原因。一天晚上，缪法在她的卧室里发现一顶男人的帽子，那是她一时糊涂干的蠢事。为了消愁解闷，她把一个过路男人带回家了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你们不知道他是多么滑稽可笑，”她继续说道，津津乐道地讲了一些细节，“实际上他是一个地道的伪君子……因为这样，他每天晚上都做祈祷。这可一点不假。他总以为我没有看见，因为我不想妨碍他，总是先上床睡觉，其实我在瞟着他，他口中念念有词……上床时还要画一个十字，从我身上跨过去，在床里边躺下……” \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！他真狡猾，”菲利普嘀咕道，“他上床前上床后都祈祷了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她莞尔一笑，说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “是这样，上床前和上床后都祈祷。当我模模糊糊要睡着时，又听见他嘴里念念有词……不过，最令人讨厌的是，我们每次争吵，他还装成一副教士的样子。我嘛，我一向是信仰宗教的，你们怎么笑我都可以，反正不影响我信仰我该信仰的宗教……他太讨厌了，他抽抽噎噎，还说他心里很内疚。前天就是这样，我们争吵后，他歇斯底里大发作，搞得我一点不得安宁……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 说到这里，她突然中断了这个话题，说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “瞧，米尼翁夫妇来了。瞧！他们把孩子也带来了！…… \\n\\n \\n\\n 小家伙们穿得怪模怪样！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 米尼翁夫妇乘坐一辆颜色素净的双篷四轮马车，那是发了横财的市民的豪华奢侈品。罗丝穿一条灰色绸裙子，裙子镶着红色绉泡饰带和花结，满面笑容，她看见亨利和夏尔挺快乐，心里很高兴。两个孩子坐在前面凳子上，穿着过分肥大的中学生制服，看上去有点耸肩缩颈。双篷四轮马车停放在栅栏边时，罗丝瞥见娜娜喜气洋洋地坐在鲜花中间，她的车子由四匹马拉着，还有穿号衣的跟班和车夫，她抿起嘴唇，板起面孔，扭过头去。米尼翁的态度恰恰相反，他容光焕发，目光炯炯，挥挥手，打了一个招呼。女人之间发生口角，他一般是不介入的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “对啦，”娜娜又说道，“你们认识一个矮个子老头吗？就是那个穿得干干净净、满嘴坏牙齿的韦诺先生……他今天早上来看过我。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “韦诺先生吗？”乔治惊愕地说道，“这不可能，他是耶稣会的会士。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “你说得很对，我也感觉出来了。啊！你们真想象不到我们谈了些什么！真有趣！……他向我谈到伯爵，说他们夫妻关系不和睦，恳求我把幸福还给他们家庭……不过，他很懂礼貌，说话时笑吟吟的……于是，我回答说，这是我求之不得的事，我保证叫伯爵同他的妻子言归于好……你们知道，我这样说不是开玩笑，看到他们幸福，我感到由衷高兴！另外，我也可以轻松一下，因为前些日子，说真的，他把我缠得够呛！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 这出自内心的呼声道出了她最近几个月来的厌倦情绪。此外，伯爵似乎手头极其拮据；他心事重重，他签给拉博德特的本票很可能兑现不了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “恰巧伯爵夫人在那儿。”乔治说道，他的目光扫视一下看台。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “她在哪儿？”娜娜大声问道，“这孩子眼睛真好！……菲利普，替我打一下阳伞。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 乔治的动作快，抢在他哥哥的前头把伞接过来，他能替娜娜拿着那把带着银色流苏的阳伞，心里非常高兴。娜娜眼睛对着一只很大的望远镜，向看台上到处观望。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！对了，我看见她了，”她终于说道，她在看台右边，在一根柱子旁边，对吗？她穿着淡紫色衣服，她女儿穿着白色衣服，坐在她身旁……瞧！达盖内走过去跟她们打招呼了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 于是，菲利普便谈起达盖内不久要同瘦高个子爱丝泰勒结婚的事。这桩婚事已经定下来了，教堂的结婚预告已经登出来了。伯爵夫人起初反对女儿的婚事，但是据说伯爵硬要她同意。娜娜听后笑了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我知道，我知道，”她低声说道，“对保尔来说，这太好了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他是个好小伙子，他配得上这门亲事。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她弯下腰，对小路易说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “你觉得好玩吗？……看你那一本正经的样子！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 孩子脸上没有一丝笑容，他看着周围的人，神态像个大人。他心情沮丧，思考着他所看到的一切。娜娜动个不停，小狗从她的裙子里跑出来，跑到孩子身边，浑身哆嗦着。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 草坪上的车马和人越来越多。马车继续不断从瀑布门那边驶来，一辆挨着一辆，排成一条长龙。其中有从意大利人大街开来的波利娜式公共马车，里面坐了五十名乘客，驶到看台右边停下来；还有运送猎犬的马车、四轮敞篷马车、豪华双篷四轮马车，它们同由劣马拉着的摇摇晃晃的破旧出租马车混在一起；有一人驾驶的四马马车，有邮车，车主人高高坐在座位上，仆人们则在车里看管香槟酒篮子，还有两轮轻便马车，巨大的钢轮闪烁着耀眼的光芒，有双套的轻便二轮马车，其部件精巧得像钟表的零件，行驶起来时，车上的铃铛叮叮作响。不时有一个骑马人，还有一群行人行色匆匆地从马车中走过。车子从遥远的布洛涅森林那边驶来，一路上发出隆隆的声音，一到草坪上，隆隆声便戛然变成低沉摩擦声；现在草坪上的人越来越多，耳畔只响着嘈杂声、叫喊声、呼唤声、鞭子在空中飞舞的劈啪声。疾风吹散乌云，太阳从一片云边上又露了出来，一道金光照射下来，把马具和上了油漆的车身照得通亮，女人们的服装被照得红艳艳的；在耀眼的光雾中，车夫们高高地坐在驾驶座上，他们的身子和长长的鞭子像着了火似的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 拉博德特从一辆敞篷四轮马车上走下来，车上还坐着加加、克莱利瑟和布朗瑟·德·西弗里，拉博德特的座位是他们留给他的。他行色匆匆，要穿越跑道，进入测量体重处时，娜娜让乔治把他叫过来。当他走过来时，娜娜笑着问道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “我的牌价是多少？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她指的是那匹取名为娜娜的小母马，这匹马在狄安娜奖比赛中遭到惨败，甚至在今年四月份和五月份举行的飞车杯奖和良种幼马大赛奖中，也未获得名次，获胜的是旺德夫尔的一匹名叫吕西尼昂的马。于是，吕西尼昂顿时成了人们的热门话题；从前一天起，人们普遍以二比一为它下赌注。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你的比数总是一比五十。”拉博德特回答道。“真见鬼，我真不值钱，”娜娜又说道，她觉得这种玩笑很逗趣，“那么，我不拿自己来赌了……绝不赌自己！我连一个金路易也不押在我自己身上。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 拉博德特忙得不亦乐乎，说完转身就走，娜娜连忙把他叫回来，她想问问他的看法。他与赛马训练师和骑师们一直有联系，对于参赛的马匹的情况特别熟悉，他的预言已经多次准确无误，人家都叫他赛马消息大王。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你说，我该押哪匹马？”娜娜再三问道，“那匹英国马的牌价是多少？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “你说的是那匹精灵马吗？是一比三……瓦勒里奥二世，也是一比三，其余的马，如科西尼是一比二十五，幸运是一比四十，布姆是一比三十，皮什内特是一比三十五，杏仁奶油是一比十……” \\n\\n \\n\\n “不，我不赌那匹英国马了，我是一个爱国的人……嗯？我可能押瓦勒里奥二世，德·科布勒兹公爵刚才喜形于色……哎！不！还是不行。五十个金路易押在吕西尼昂上，你说行吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 拉博德特用异乎寻常的表情看了她一眼。娜娜俯着身子，低声询问他，因为她知道旺德夫尔委托拉博德特到赛马赌注登记人那里为他下赌注的，以便赌得更方便些。他若得到什么消息，就会说出来。可是拉博德特什么也未透露，叫她相信他嗅觉是敏感的，他将根据自己的判断，把她的五十个金路易押上去，她对此是不会后悔的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你押在哪一匹马上都行！”她高兴地叫道，让他走了，“但是不要押在娜娜身上，那是一匹劣马！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 马车里的人都哄堂大笑。两个年轻人觉得她这句话很有趣；小路易不懂他们谈什么，抬起他那泛白的眼睛瞧着他的妈妈，他妈妈的响亮的话声使他吃了一惊。拉博德特还是不能脱身。罗丝·米尼翁向他招招手，关照他几句话，他把数字记在笔记本上。随后，克拉利瑟和加加又叫他，她们在人群中听到一些话后，想把赌注改押一下，她们不想押瓦勒里奥二世，而想押吕西尼昂。他的表情镇定自若，只顾记录。最后，他算脱身了，大家看见他在跑道另一边的两个看台之间消失了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时还不断有马车到来。现在，车子已经排了五排，马车沿着栅栏不断扩大，形成黑压压的一大片，其中还夹杂着一匹匹白马，远远看去像一个个浅色的斑点。这片马车再过去一些的地方，杂乱无章地停放着另一些马车，这些马车都散开来放，好像搁浅在草地上，车轮子、套车的牲口看上去乱糟糟的，随便停放，有并排的，有斜放的，有横放的，还有头对头的。在那些没有车辆、马匹的草坪上，骑师们在骑马训练，步行的人三五成群地走来走去。在这集市般的场地上，在这乱哄哄的人群中，卖饮料的流动摊子上都撑起了遮阳光的灰色帆布篷，帆布篷在阳光下泛着白色。但是在那些赌注登记人的周围，人群涌动，拥挤不堪，无数帽子晃动着，赌注登记人站在敞篷马车上，像牙医一样不停摆动两只手，在他们身边的高大木架上，贴着中奖的牌价表。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我真蠢，连自己都不知道押哪一匹马，”娜娜说道，“我应该自己押上几个金路易来冒冒险。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她站起来，想选一个态度和蔼的赌注登记人。然而，她发现周围有很多熟悉的面孔，便把刚才的想法置之脑后了。除了米尼翁夫妇、加加、克拉利瑟和布朗瑟，在她的右边、左边、后边，现在还有许多马车把她的双篷四轮马车团团围住，其中有塔唐·内内和玛丽亚·布隆乘坐的四轮敞篷马车；卡罗利娜·埃凯与她的母亲和两位先生乘坐的敞篷四轮马车；路易丝·维奥莱纳一人单独乘坐的篮式小马车，车身上披着梅尚家赛马号衣的橙、绿两种颜色。莱娅·德·霍恩坐在一辆邮车的高高座位上，身边围着一群大声喧哗的年轻人，再远一些，在一辆颇具贵族气派的敞篷四轮马车上，吕西·斯图华穿着一件朴素的黑绸连衣裙，露出一副高贵的神态，旁边坐着一个高个子年轻人，他身着海军军官学校的学生服。令娜娜吃惊的是，她看见西蒙娜来了，她坐在由斯泰内驾着的双套二轮马车上。她身后站着一个听差，他一动不动，双臂叉在胸前；她浑身穿得耀眼夺目，上下都穿着带黄色条纹的白缎子，从腰带一直到帽子都缀满了宝石。银行家挥动着手中的长鞭子，赶着两匹马像箭一样飞奔着，前面是一匹栗黄色矮马，奔跑起来像只老鼠，后面是一匹高大的枣红马，奔跑时，蹄子抬得很高。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “哎哟！娜娜说道，“斯泰内这个盗贼又一次洗劫了交易所！……嗯？西蒙娜一身穿得真时髦！他也太过分了，他要被人抓住的。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 不过，她还是老远就与他打了招呼。她挥着手，满面春风，转动着身子，向每个人打招呼，以便让大家都看见她。接着她又说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “吕西带来的那个年轻人是她儿子！他穿着制服，挺可爱的……所以她装成那副样子！你们知道她怕她的儿子，所以冒充演员……小伙子怪可怜的！他似乎一点疑心也没有。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “唔！”菲利普笑着嘟哝道，“只要她愿意，她还能在外省给他找一个女遗产继承人做老婆呢。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜不吭声了。她在密密麻麻的车辆中，瞥见了老虔婆拉特里贡。拉特里贡乘的是出租马车，她坐在里面，外面什么也看不见，就悄悄爬到马车夫的座位上。她坐在高处，高大的身子挺得笔直，显出一副高贵的神态，鬓角上的鬈发留得很长。她俯视着人群，仿佛俯视着她的妓女臣民。妓女们都悄悄地对她微笑着。而她神态高傲，装作不认识她们。她这次来不是拉皮条的，而是出于兴致来看赛马的，她是一个狂热的赌徒，她最爱看赛马。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “瞧！那是傻瓜拉法卢瓦兹！”乔治突然说道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 大家都很惊讶。娜娜认不出她的拉法卢瓦兹了。自从他继承了那笔遗产后，变得非常时髦。他穿折角硬领，浑身上下穿着浅色衣服，在他瘦削的肩膀处绷得紧紧的。他头戴无边软帽，装出疲倦的样子，身体摇摇晃晃，说话娇声娇气，满嘴是俚语行话，一句话总是说半句，生怕多花气力。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “可是他挺有风度嘛！”娜娜说道，她对他着迷了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 加加和克拉利瑟把拉法卢瓦兹叫过去，扑过去拥抱他，想把他再次弄到手。但他把腰一扭，马上离开她们，这个动作既表示开玩笑，又表示轻蔑。他被娜娜迷住了，他跑到她旁边，站在马车的踏板上；娜娜同他开玩笑，说他与加加要好。他嘟囔道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！不，我同那个老太婆的关系断了！别再提她啦！我告诉你，你知道，现在我的朱丽叶是你……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 拉法卢瓦兹极富表情地把手放在心上。娜娜开怀大笑，他竟然在光天化日之下，突然向她倾吐爱慕之情。不过，她接着说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “唉！事情不完全像你所说的那样。你使我忘记去下赌注了……乔治，你看见那个赌注登记人了吧，在那边，那个红脸胖子，满头鬈发。他那油头滑脑的样子，我倒挺喜欢的……你去叫他押……嗯？不过，押哪匹马好呢？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “我吗，我不是爱国者，啊！不！”拉法卢瓦兹结结巴巴地说，“我，我都押在那匹英国马上了……如果英国马赢了，那就太好了！法国人就滚蛋吧！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜听了非常气愤。于是，大家便议论起每匹马的优点。拉法卢瓦兹装得很内行，他把所有的马都说成劣马。他接着评论起来：“韦尔迪埃男爵的那匹杏红奶油，说实话，倒是一匹高大的枣红马，如果不是训练时弄得筋疲力尽，倒是有希望获胜的。至于科布勒兹的那匹瓦勒里奥二世，在四月份患了绞痛病，不能参加比赛；噢，这些情况人家都不说出来，不过，他用荣誉担保，他说的情况是确实无疑的！他最后劝娜娜押幸运，它是梅尚家的，大家认为那是最差的一匹马，谁也不肯押它。真了不起！幸运体形漂亮，行动敏捷！这匹马肯定会让大家吃惊！” \\n\\n \\n\\n “不！”娜娜说，“我在吕西尼昂身上押了十个金路易，五个金路易押在布姆身上。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 拉法卢瓦兹马上嚷道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “亲爱的，布姆糟透了！不要押它！连加斯克自己都不押它……而吕西尼昂，永远不能赌它！简直是开玩笑！我向上帝发誓，你好好想一想！不行，我向上帝发誓，它们的腿都太短了！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他急得透不过气来。菲利普指出，吕西尼昂获得过飞车杯奖和良种幼马大赛奖。拉法卢瓦兹立即驳斥说，这又能证明什么呢？什么也不能证明。恰恰相反，应该对这一点产生怀疑。何况骑吕西尼昂的骑师是格雷沙姆；你们竟然给它打包票！格雷沙姆是个倒霉鬼，它绝对赢不了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在娜娜的马车上掀起的这场争论，现在似乎扩大到整个草坪上。一些人发出尖叫声，赌博的热情高涨了，每人的脸上火辣辣的，大家挥舞着拳头。赌注登记人高高地站在他们的马车上，声嘶力竭地喊着中彩牌价，记录着数字。呆在这里的都是一些下小赌注的赌客，押大赌注的都在体重测量处的围墙内进行；在这里进行激烈较量的，只是一些囊中没有几个钱的人，拿一百个苏来冒冒险，觊觎的也不过是几个金路易。总而言之，一场大战将在精灵和吕西尼昂之间展开。一些英国人一看就认得出来，他们在人群中来回走动，像在自己家里一样，个个满脸通红，露出胜利者的神态。里丁勋爵的那匹名叫布拉玛的马，在去年的大奖赛中赢得了胜利，法国人还在为法国马的惨败而心痛不已，今年如果法国再次败北，将是法国人的一次灾难。所以，出于民族自豪感，太太们都兴奋万分。旺德夫尔的马变成她们的荣誉的堡垒，大家都推吕西尼昂，为它辩护，为它欢呼。加加、布朗瑟、卡罗利娜和其他人都押吕西尼昂。吕西·斯图华因为儿子在场，没有下赌注；有消息传说罗丝·米尼翁委托拉博德特为她押了两百金路易。只有拉特里贡一人坐在车夫旁边，要等到最后再押赌注；她不管别人的争论，保持着冷静，越来越响的嘈杂声对她的情绪毫无影响。嘈杂声中有人叫马的名字，在巴黎人的轻快的谈话声中，夹杂着英国人的带喉音的叫嚷声，她神色庄重，一边听着，一边把数字记下来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “娜娜呢？”乔治问道，“没有人押它吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 确实如此，谁也不愿押娜娜；人们甚至连提都不提它。在旺德夫尔的马中，这匹获胜希望甚微的马，随着吕西尼昂越来越有名，而变得销声匿迹了。拉法卢瓦兹向空中举了一下胳膊，说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “我忽然想起来了……我来押一个金路易在娜娜身上。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “好极了，我押两个金路易。”乔治说道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我押三个金路易。”菲利普接着他们的话说道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们提高了赌注的数目，对娜娜大献殷勤，他们不断喊出一个个数字，仿佛在拍卖行里竞相购买娜娜似的。拉法卢瓦兹还说要用钱把这匹马盖住。而且大家都该来在它身上押赌注，他们还要去再拉一些赌客来下它的赌注。可是三个年轻人正要离开去宣传时，娜娜叫住他们，说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “你们知道，我可不愿在这匹马上下赌注！不管怎样我也不下赌注！……乔治，替我押十个金路易在吕西尼昂身上，押五个金路易在瓦勒里奥二世身上。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 可是，他们飞快地走了。娜娜高兴极了，她望着他们在马车中间穿行，弯着腰从马头下面走来走去，跑遍了整个草坪。他们一看见哪辆马车里有熟人，便赶紧跑过去，竭力推荐娜娜。当他们推荐成功了，就转过头来，笑容满面，伸出手指，表示数字多少，娜娜站在车上，摇动着阳伞，人群中发出一阵哄堂大笑。不过，他们的成绩相当可怜。只有几个男人被他们说服了，例如斯泰内，只要他一看见娜娜，心里就发痒，他押了三个金路易冒冒险。但是女人们都干脆拒绝下赌注。谢谢吧，下了肯定要输掉！干吗急于去为一个娼妇扬名而卖力呢？这个婊子以她的四匹白马，她的跟班和她那副趾高气扬的神态，把她们都压垮了。加加和克拉利瑟很不高兴，责问拉法卢瓦兹是不是根本不把她们放在眼里。乔治鼓着勇气走到米尼翁夫妇的马车前面，罗丝怒不可遏，转过头去，不理睬他。把自己的名字给了一匹马，真是一个十足的下流货！米尼翁则不然，他兴致勃勃地听乔治的宣传，说女人总是会给人带来好运的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 几个年轻人跑了很长时间，去找赌注登记人了解情况，当他们回来时，娜娜问道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “情况怎么样？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “你是一比四十！”拉法卢瓦兹说道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “怎么啦？我是一比四十！”娜娜惊愕地嚷道，“刚才我还是一比五十……发生什么事啦？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 恰巧这时候拉博德特又来了。跑道已被封闭了，一阵钟声宣告初赛开始。大家全神贯注地观看，发出问这问那的喧哗声。娜娜问拉博德特，她的牌价为什么骤然提高了。但他只支支吾吾地回答，说可能是有人下她的赌注了。她只能得到这样的解释。另外，拉博德特似乎忧心忡忡，他对她说，旺德夫尔若能脱身，马上就会来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 初赛结束了，大家观看的兴趣似乎不大，因为每人都在等待着观看大奖赛。这时跑马场上下起雨来了。太阳已被云遮盖了一阵子，天空灰蒙蒙的，阴沉沉的光线照在人群中。顿时刮起风来了，接着又下起滂沱大雨，豆粒大的雨点瓢泼而下。人群中一阵混乱，有人喊叫，有人开玩笑，也有人咒骂，徒步来的人四处奔跑，躲到饮料摊点的帐篷下避雨。在马车上，妇女们用手撑着阳伞避雨，跟班们匆匆忙忙跑过去撑车篷。暴雨停止了，灿烂的阳光照着还在飘飘洒洒的毛毛细雨，云层里露出一道蓝天，乌云被吹到布洛涅森林上空去了。天空仿佛笑逐颜开，妇女们放心了，她们都笑起来；马匹在喷鼻息，人群散乱了，人们抖动着淋湿的衣服，金色阳光照射着雨滴莹亮的草地。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！可怜的小路易！”娜娜说道，“你给淋得很厉害吧，我的宝贝？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 小家伙不吭一声，让妈妈给他揩手。娜娜拿出手帕，揩了小路易后，又去揩哆嗦得更厉害的狗珍宝。她的白缎衣服上有几滴雨点，这算不了什么，她根本不在乎；车上的鲜花被雨一淋，像雪花一样闪闪发亮，她拿了一朵，兴致勃勃地闻一闻，她的嘴唇沾湿了，就像沾上了露水。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这阵骤雨使看台上挤满了避雨的人。娜娜用望远镜向台上看去。这么远的距离，只能看见台上密密麻麻的观众，看上去模模糊糊，他们乱糟糟的挤在一排排台阶上，在这昏暗的背景上，只有人的面孔发亮，像是一个个苍白的点子。阳光从看台顶上的角上射下来，只照亮了一部分坐着的观众，妇女们的衣服这时似乎暗淡下来，娜娜感到特别有趣的是骤雨把坐在看台下面的沙土上一排排椅子上的妇女淋得四下逃散。因为骑师体重测量处的围墙内是禁止妓女入内的，娜娜对这些得体的妇女说了一些刻薄话，她觉得她们衣着打扮怪模怪样，长相很滑稽。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 人群中发出一阵喧闹声，皇后走进正中间的小看台上，看台是瑞士山区的木屋式样，宽大的阳台上摆着一些红扶手椅。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “瞧，是他！”乔治嚷道，“我还以为他这个星期不值班呢。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊，是夏尔！”娜娜叫起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 缪法伯爵出现在皇后的身后，他的表情呆板而又严肃。于是几个年轻人开起玩笑来，遗憾的是萨丹没有来，不然她就会去拍拍伯爵的肚皮。娜娜在望远镜里看见的是苏格兰王子，他也在皇后的看台上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 她觉得王子发福了。十八个月不见，他长胖了。接着她就详细讲起王子的情况：哦！他真是个壮实的汉子。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在娜娜周围的车子里，妇女们议论纷纷，说伯爵抛弃了她。她们编了一段故事，说什么自从伯爵因为同娜娜的关系而惹人注目后，杜伊勒里宫对这位王室侍从的行为非常愤慨。于是，伯爵为了保住自己的位置，便断绝了与娜娜的关系。拉法卢瓦兹坦诚地把这些话告诉了娜娜，并且毛遂自荐，称她为自己的朱丽叶。而娜娜只莞尔一笑，说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “这个笨蛋……你还不了解他，我只要对他叫一声‘喂’，他就会丢下一切跑过来。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她把萨比娜伯爵夫人和爱丝泰勒端详了一阵子。达盖内还在她们身边。福什利来了，穿过人群去向她们打招呼，接着他也留在她们身边，满脸堆着微笑。这时，娜娜轻蔑地指着看台，继续说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “再说，你们知道，我再也不把这伙人放在眼里了……我太了解他们了。应当剥开他们的画皮来看！……这样，他们就没有尊严了！他们的尊严就完蛋了！他们从上到下都肮脏，他们总是肮脏不堪，无一例外……我所以不愿意让他们来缠住我，原因就在这里。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她用手指的人的范围扩大到把马牵到跑道上的马夫，直至同夏尔王子谈话的皇后，连王子也是个混蛋。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “说得好，娜娜！……说得妙，娜娜！……”拉法卢瓦兹兴奋而又激动地叫道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 又敲响了一阵钟声，钟声消失在风中，赛马又开始了。伊斯帕汗奖赛刚赛完，梅尚家的一匹名叫贝兰戈的马获胜。娜娜把拉博德特叫到跟前，问他关于她那一百金路易的消息；他笑了笑，不肯把他的马的名字告诉她，据他说，那样会失掉运气。她的钱押得稳当当的，过一会儿就见分晓了。娜娜告诉他，她自己也下了赌注，押了十个金路易在吕西尼昂身上，押了五个金路易在瓦勒里奥二世身上，他听后耸耸肩膀，那表情的意思似乎是说女人总免不了做傻事。娜娜愣住了，她被懵住了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时，草坪上人声鼎沸。人们在露天里一边吃午饭，一边等待大奖赛开始。大家都在吃饭饮酒，到处都一样，在草地上，在一人驾驶的四匹马车的高高座位上，在四匹马拉的邮车上，在四轮敞篷马车上，在双座轿式马车上，在双篷四轮马车上，到处都一样。冷肉随处可见，跟班们从车箱里拿出来一篮篮香槟酒，然后随处一放。开瓶时轻轻砰的一声响，瓶塞就随风飘走了；开玩笑的声音随处可闻，酒杯的破碎声给这狂欢的气氛增添了不和谐的色调。加加和克拉利瑟与布朗瑟在一起吃饭，她们一本正经地把盖布铺在膝盖上，上面放着三明治。路易丝·维奥莱纳从她的篮式马车上下来，同卡罗利娜·埃凯聚在一起；在他们旁边，几位先生在草坪上撑起帐篷，当作一个酒吧间，塔唐、玛丽亚、西蒙娜和其他人都走过来饮酒；离他们不远的地方，在莱娅·德·霍恩的邮车上，一伙年轻人在高处喝了一瓶又一瓶，在阳光下，他们醉醺醺的，在人群上空装腔作势，大吹牛皮。不一会儿，人们便涌到娜娜的双篷四轮马车前边。娜娜站着，给来向她致意的男人们倒香槟酒，她的听差弗朗索瓦把酒一瓶瓶递给他们，拉法卢瓦兹竭力模仿江湖艺人的腔调，大声吆喝： \\n\\n \\n\\n “过来吧，先生们……分文不取，大家都有。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “住嘴吧，亲爱的，”娜娜终于说道，“你这样大声嚷嚷，人家把我们当成走江湖的人了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她觉得他挺有趣的，心里很高兴。她突然想起叫乔治送一杯香槟酒给罗丝·米尼翁，因为罗丝假装不会喝酒。亨利和夏尔烦闷得发慌，很想喝杯香槟酒。最后，乔治自己把酒喝了，因为他怕娜娜和罗丝为这事吵起来。这时娜娜想起了小路易，她忘记他就在她的身后。他也许渴了，她硬要他喝了几滴酒，他喝了直咳嗽。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “过来呀，过来呀，先生们，二个苏也不要，一个苏也不要……我们免费请大家喝……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜突然大叫一声，打断了拉法卢瓦兹的吆喝： \\n\\n \\n\\n “哎哟！博尔德纳夫在那边……叫他过来呀，啊！我请你去叫他，快跑过去叫他！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 果然是博尔德纳夫，他反剪着双手在溜达。头上的帽子被太阳照得泛红，身上的礼服油垢斑斑，缝线处已经发白，他被破产弄得年老色衰，但他内心仍愤愤不平，让上流社会看看自己的贫困潦倒的样子，准备以他虎背熊腰的身体去向命运挑战。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “天哪！真气派！”娜娜像一个好心的姑娘，向他伸过手去时，他说道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 随后，他喝干了一杯香槟酒，不无遗憾地说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！如果我是女人就好了！……但是，他妈的！不是也没关系！你愿意回到舞台上来吗？我有一个想法，我把快乐剧院租下来，我们两个人就可以轰动巴黎……嗯？你应该帮我这个忙。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他怨天尤人，不过他见到娜娜还是挺高兴的，他说，因为只要这个美人儿娜娜在他面前，他心里就有了安慰。她是他的女儿，她身上有他的血液。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜周围的人越来越多了。现在拉法卢瓦兹在忙着斟酒，菲利普和乔治则拉朋友到这里来。整个草坪上的人都拥过来了。娜娜对每个人莞尔一笑，说一句逗趣的话。一群群酒鬼都向她这边走来，分散在各处的香槟酒都集中到她这里。不一会儿，草坪上只见一群挤在她周围的人，只听到一片喧闹声；她俯视着那些向她伸过来的酒杯，她的金发在空中飘荡，她的雪白的脸蛋沐浴着阳光。为了气气那些对她的胜利感到气愤的女人，她站在高处，举起斟得满满的酒杯，摆出过去扮演的胜利者爱神的姿势。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时，有人在她的背后拍了一下，她吃了一惊，转过头来一看，是米尼翁坐在车座上。于是她离开大家一会儿，坐到米尼翁旁边，他是来告诉娜娜一件严重的事的。米尼翁到处跟人说，他的老婆怀恨娜娜是可笑的，他认为她这样做是愚蠢的，也是徒劳的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “是这样的，亲爱的，”他悄声说道，“你要当心，不要过分惹罗丝生气……你知道，这事我还是事先告诉你为好……是的，她抓住了你一个把柄，而且她对《小公爵夫人》这件事还耿耿于怀……” \\n\\n \\n\\n “一个把柄，”娜娜说道，“这与我有什么关系！” \\n\\n \\n\\n “你听我说，她大概在福什利的口袋里发现了一封信，是缪法伯爵夫人写给坏蛋福什利的。当然罗，那封信里的内容是可想而知的，里面尽是一些丑事……罗丝想把那封信寄给伯爵，对他和你进行报复。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “这与我有什么关系！”娜娜又重复了一遍，“这真滑稽，这件事……啊！行了，她与福什利相好，这样很好，她让我讨厌。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这下子我们可有好戏看喽。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “不，我可不愿意这样。这可是一件大丑闻！另外，这样闹对我们都没有好处……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他说到这里停下来，生怕言多必失。娜娜大声嚷嚷，她绝不会去搭救一个正经女人的。因为米尼翁坚持自己的意见，娜娜的目光一直盯住他。米尼翁之所以如此，大概他怕福什利同伯爵夫人断绝关系后，再插足他们的家庭。如果能这样，倒正中罗丝下怀，又为她报了仇，因为她对这位新闻记者还怀有一片深情。娜娜沉思起来，她想到韦诺先生的来访，头脑里产生了一个计划，而米尼翁仍在竭力说服她。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “假如罗丝寄出那封信，对吧？那就会引起一场轩然大波。你就受到牵连，人家就会说你是罪魁祸首……首先，伯爵就要同他的妻子分居……” \\n\\n \\n\\n “为什么要分居？”她说，“正好相反……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 这次是她收住话头。她没有必要把头脑里想的事情都大声说出来。最后，她为了摆脱米尼翁，表面上装出赞同他的意见。米尼翁劝她对罗丝作点让步，比如到跑马场上，当着大家的面，去看看她。她回答说，等等再说，她再考虑一下。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 人群中响起一阵喧嚣声，娜娜站起身来。一些赛马一阵风似地到了跑道上。刚刚举行的是巴黎市奖赛，一匹叫风笛的马获胜了。现在大奖赛就要开始了，观众的热情高涨，他们焦急地等待着，巴不得时间过得快一些，观众急得跺脚，人群像波浪一样动荡着。到了最后的时刻，出现了意外的情况，这使赌客们大为震惊。旺德夫尔的那匹获奖希望甚微的娜娜的牌价在不断上涨，不时有几位先生回来报告娜娜的新牌价：娜娜是一比三十，娜娜是一比二十五，娜娜是一比二十，娜娜是一比十五。谁都不明白是怎么回事。一匹在任何马场上都惨败的小母马，早上标价一比五十，都没有一个人愿押！现在标价突然风涨究竟意味着什么？一些人嘲讽说，凡是上了这个闹剧当的傻瓜都要输得精光。另一些人则态度严肃，心中不安，预感到内中有鬼，也许这是一个圈套。有人含沙射影，提起一些赛马场上默许的舞弊行为；但是这一次，旺德夫尔的鼎鼎大名使人不敢提出指责，总之，怀疑派占了上风，他们预言娜娜一定会最后一个到达终点。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “娜娜的骑师是谁？”拉法卢瓦兹问道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 恰巧这时候，真的娜娜出现了。于是，这些先生们大笑不止，理解了其中也含有淫秽的意思。娜娜向大家挥手致意。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “是普里斯。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 于是大家又议论纷纷。普里斯在英国颇有名气，在法国却鲜为人知。平时总是格雷沙姆骑娜娜，为什么旺德夫尔这次请来这位骑师呢？另外，人们惊讶的是他把吕西尼昂也交给格雷沙姆，据拉法卢瓦兹说，格雷沙姆从来没有跑赢过。不过，所有这些意见，都被开玩笑的话、反对的意见和各种不寻常的意见的嘈杂声淹没了。人们为了消磨时间，又喝起香槟酒。接着，听见一阵窃窃私语声，人群中让出一条路来。旺德夫尔来了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜佯作生气。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “嘿，你真讨人喜欢，这时候才来！……我急死了，我想赶快去看看体重测量处那里的情况。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “那么，你就去吧，”旺德夫尔说，“现在看还不迟。你进去转一转。我身上正好还有一张妇女入场券。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 接着他便挽起娜娜的胳膊走了，吕西、卡罗利娜和其他女人都用嫉妒的目光注视着她，对此她倒感到得意。于贡兄弟和拉法卢瓦兹仍然留在她身后的马车上，他们在继续畅饮她的香槟酒。她向他们大声喊道，说她马上就回来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 旺德夫尔一瞥见拉博德特，便跟他打招呼，他们交谈了三言两语。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你都收齐了吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “是的。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “一共多少？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “一千五百金路易，全场各处都有一点。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们见娜娜竖着耳朵好奇地听他们讲话，便不再说下去了。旺德夫尔有些烦躁不安，明澈的眼睛闪闪发亮，那天夜里，他说要放火同他的马匹同归于尽时，眼睛里也闪烁着这种光亮，当时她被吓得胆战心惊。他们横穿跑道时，她压低了声音，用亲昵的称呼对他说： \\n\\n \\n\\n “喂，你说说吧……为什么你的那匹小母马的牌价一直在上涨？大家都议论纷纷！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他战栗了一下，脱口说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！他们在议论……这些赌客，真是无耻之极！当我有一匹有希望获胜的马时，他们就一拥而上，把我搞得赢不了。等到我的一匹获胜希望很小的小母马被人们竞相押赌注时，他们又大肆喧嚷，像被人剥皮似的大喊大叫。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “你应该预先告诉我，我已下赌注了，”她又说，“娜娜有希望获胜吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他莫名其妙地突然发起火来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “哎！别烦了……每匹马都有希望。牌价上涨，当然是因为有人下赌注。谁下赌注？我不知道……如果你再提这些愚蠢的问题来烦我，我宁愿离开你。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 这样说话的口气不像他的性格，也不像他的习惯，与其说她感到不快，还不如说她感到惊讶。而旺德夫尔呢，他觉得有些羞愧，当她态度冷漠地要求他说话礼貌一些时，他便向她道歉。一段时间以来，他经常这样突然发脾气。在巴黎的风流男女中和上流社会中，没有人不知道他是在孤注一掷。如果他的赛马都跑不赢，把押在它们身上的巨款全部输光，对他来说，将是一场大灾难，他就彻底完蛋；他那长年累月建立起来的信誉，他那已受损坏、被债务和放荡掏空了的生命所维持的华丽外表，就要在毁灭性的巨响中崩溃。没有一个人不知道，娜娜是吞噬男人的娼妇，是她葬送了他；她是在他濒于破产时，最后来到他生活中的女人，她把他的财产洗劫一空。据说他们疯狂地挥霍钱财，一次去巴黎旅游，她把他的钱花得精光，最后连付旅馆的钱也不剩；一天晚上，他们醉酒后，居然抓起一把钻石扔进炭火里，想观察一下钻石是否也像煤炭一样燃烧。娜娜以她粗壮的四肢、巴黎郊区妇女的下流笑声征服了这个精明、没落的古老家族的子弟。现在，他已好色成性，连戒心也丧失殆尽，只好铤而走险了。一个星期以前，她还要他答应她在勒阿弗尔和特鲁维尔之间的诺曼底海滨买一座别墅，他只能用他的最后荣誉来保证他信守自己的诺言。不过，这一次她惹怒了他，他觉得她很愚蠢，真想揍她一顿。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 守门人放他们进入骑师体重测量处内，因为他不敢阻拦挽住伯爵胳膊的这个女人。娜娜洋洋得意，终于踏上了这块禁地，她在那些坐在台下的妇女面前，装模作样，慢悠悠地走过去。那里十排椅子上坐着密密麻麻一大群妇女，她们的浓艳的服饰与露天下的欢乐气氛显得和谐而协调。有些椅子移动了位置，一些人遇见了熟人，便随便地坐到一起，像在公园里树荫下纳凉一样；孩子们无人管了，从这一群里跑到那一群里。往高处看去，看台的梯级上都挤满了人，浅色的衣服和看台架子的淡淡的影子浑然一体。娜娜打量着那些妇女。她还牢牢地瞅着萨比娜伯爵夫人。随后，她走到皇后的看台前面，看见缪法直挺挺地站在皇后的身旁，显出一本正经的样子，她觉得挺可笑的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “哎哟，瞧他那副傻样子！”她大声对旺德夫尔说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 她什么都想看一看。公园的这个角落里有草坪，有浓密的树木，似乎还值得一看。一个冷饮商在栅栏边摆了一只大冷饮柜。在一间茅草顶蘑菇状的简陋的亭子下面，一大群人挤在里面指手画脚，大声喧哗，这是赛马场里的赌客席。旁边有些马栏是空的，她在那里只看见一匹警察的马，觉得有点扫兴。再过去是遛马场，周长有一百米，一个马夫牵着身披马衣的瓦勒里奥二世遛跑。啊，不过就是这样！在那条细沙小路上有许多男人，他们的衣服扣眼上别着桔黄色的入场券，露天看台的走廊上不断有人在走动，这倒吸引了她一会儿；可是，说真的，这个地方不准进来也好，不值得为这事生气。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 达盖内和福什利走过那里，娜娜同他俩打招呼。她招了招手，他们只好走过来。她开口就猛然攻击骑师体重测量处。接着，她停止了攻击，说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “瞧！德·舒阿尔侯爵变得苍老多了！这个老头子在折腾自己！他还是那样好色吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 于是，达盖内讲了老头子最近的行动，这件事发在在前天，现在谁也不知道。他跟着加加转了几个月，不久前把加加的女儿阿梅莉买到手，据说他花了整整三万法郎。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “哎，真龌龊！”娜娜愤愤地嚷道，“你们以后尽生女儿吧！……哟，我想起来了，在那边草坪上，与一位太太坐在一辆轿式马车里的大概是莉莉。所以我觉得她面熟……老头子把她带出来了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 旺德夫尔不听她讲，心里很不耐烦，恨不得摆脱她。但是，福什利临走时对她说，如果她没有看过赌注登记人，那就等于什么也没有看。尽管伯爵露出不愿意去的样子，还是不得不带她去看。这下子娜娜可高兴了；那里确实很吸引人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 一个四周敞开的圆亭，周围有草坪环绕，草坪边上长着幼小栗树；在嫩绿色的树叶遮盖下，一群赌注登记人紧紧地排成一个大圆圈，等待赌客的到来，就像在集市里一样。赌注登记人都站到木凳子上，以便俯视着人群；他们身旁的树上挂着赛马的牌价；他们仔细观察人群中的一举一动，只要赌客做做手势，眨眨眼睛，他们就把赌注登记下来，其速度之快，令好奇的观众吃惊，他们的目光盯着他们，简直不知道是怎么回事。这里一片混乱，只听见喊叫一个个数字，若赛马的牌价出乎意料地一变化，就引起一阵骚乱。不时消息报告人跑来，停在圆亭入口处，猛叫一声，报告赛马起跑和到达终点的消息，顿时喧闹声越发高涨，于是在阳光下进行的这场狂热赌博引起人们长时间的议论。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “他们真有趣！”娜娜兴致勃勃，喃喃说道，“他们的神态异常……瞧，那个大个子，我真不愿意一个人在树林里碰见他。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 旺德夫尔用手指着一个人叫她看，那个人是时新服饰推销员，他在两年中赚了三百万法郎。他的身材细长，体质纤弱，头发金黄，站在他周围的人都带着敬佩的目光注意着他，同他说话时都面带微笑，一些人还特意滞留下来看看他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 最后，他们要离开圆亭了，这时一个赌注登记人冒昧呼唤旺德夫尔，伯爵向他微微点头。这个人是他过去的马车夫，身材高大，宽肩厚背，高额头，满面红光。现在他带着来路不明的钱，到赛马场来碰碰运气。伯爵竭力怂恿他，并叫他为自己下秘密赌注，他总是把他当作仆人，这一点伯爵没有瞒着别人。尽管得到伯爵的庇护，他还是连连输掉巨款，今天他也来孤注一掷，两眼充满血丝，随时都可能中风送命。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “喂，马雷夏尔！”旺德夫尔低声说道，“你自己押了多少钱？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “我押了五千金路易，伯爵先生，”赌注登记人也压低嗓门说道，“怎么样？数额可观吧……我对你说实话，我把牌价压到了三。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 旺德夫尔马上露出不高兴的样子。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “不行，不行，我不愿意，你给我马上改押到二……其它没有什么关照你了，马雷夏尔！” \\n\\n \\n\\n “哦！现在这对伯爵先生又有什么关系呢？”马雷夏尔谦恭地微微一笑，以同谋者的口气说道，“我必须吸引更多的赌客，才能押满你的两千金路易。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 接着，旺德夫尔叫他住嘴。但是，等到伯爵走远时，马雷夏尔突然又想起一件事，他懊悔没有问伯爵那匹小母马的牌价为什么上涨。如果那匹小母马真有赢的希望，他就糟透了，因为他刚才以五十的牌价押了二百金路易。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 伯爵与马雷夏尔咕咕哝哝说了一阵话，娜娜一点也听不懂，然而她又不敢再问他。伯爵神色更紧张了，他们在过磅厅前遇见了拉博德特，他便突然把娜娜托付给他照顾一下。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你带她回去吧，”他说道，“我还有事情呢……再见。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 随后他走进过磅厅，那间屋子狭小，天花板很低，里面放了一个大磅秤，显得很拥挤，颇像郊区车站的行李房。娜娜很扫兴，她本来想象中的过磅厅是一个很大的房间，里面放一台巨大的机器来称马的体重。怎么！这里只称骑师的体重！那么用过磅处这样的名字，值得这样小题大做吗！磅秤上站着一个骑师，一副傻相，膝盖上放着马具，等待一个穿礼服的胖子来称他的体重；一个马夫牵着一匹名叫科西尼的马，站在门口，周围挤了一群人，全都一声不吭，出神地观看。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 就要关闭跑道了。拉博德特催促娜娜赶快走，而他自己却又走回来，指着一个正在与旺德夫尔谈话的矮个子男人，对她说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “瞧，这就是普里斯。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！我知道，就是骑我的那个人。”娜娜微笑着低声说道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 她觉得他相貌很丑。在她看来，骑师的样子都像克汀病患者；她还说，这大概是因为人家不让他们长高。就说这个人吧，已经四十岁了，样子像一个干瘪的老小孩，脸又长又瘦，皱纹很深，呆板而无生气。他的身体骨瘦如柴，身上的一件白袖子蓝绸赛马上衣像披在一根木头上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “不，你知道，”她离开时说道，“他要是我的男人，我是不会感到幸福的。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 跑道上仍然挤满了乱哄哄的人群，潮湿的草地被人践踏成了黑色。两块赛马一览表的牌子高高悬挂在一根铁柱子上，牌子前面挤成一团，个个抬头观看，每次一览表上出现一匹赛马的号码，人群中就发出一阵喧闹声，号码是通过一根连结到过磅厅的电线在一览表上显示出来的。一些先生对着节目单指指点点；那匹名叫皮什内特的马被它的主人撤回去了，引起人们一阵议论。不过，娜娜仍然挽着拉博德特的胳膊，穿过跑道。挂在旗杆上的钟敲个不停，催促人们离开跑道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！孩子们，”娜娜回到马车上说道，“他们的过磅处，是他们胡吹出来的东西！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她周围的人为她欢呼，鼓掌： \\n\\n \\n\\n “好极了！娜娜！……娜娜又回到我们这儿来了！……”他们是多么愚蠢！难道他们把她当成一个无情无义的人吗？她回来得正是时候。注意！大奖赛马上开始了，人们高兴得忘记喝香槟酒了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜吃了一惊，发现加加坐在她的马车里，膝盖上放着小狗和小路易；加加打定主意再接近拉法卢瓦兹，但却对娜娜说，她想亲亲小路易。她很喜欢孩子。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “噢，对了，莉莉现在怎样？”娜娜问道，“坐在那边老头子的马车里的那个孩子是她吗？……有人刚才跟我讲了一件不堪入耳的事情。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 加加脸上露出沮丧的样子。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “亲爱的，我为这件事气病了，”她难过地说道，“昨天，我只好在床上躺了一天，我哭得厉害，我本来以为今天来不成了……嗯？你知道我的意见吗？我是不同意的，我把她送到修道院里去受教育，就是为了将来找一个好丈夫。我常常严肃地对她提出忠告，对她管教没有中断过……哎，亲爱的，是她自己愿意的。哎！我同她吵了一架，说了一些难听的话，我还掴了她一记耳光呢。她太烦恼了，她要摆脱这种生活……于是，她对我说：‘不管怎样，你没有权利阻止我这样做。’我对她说，‘你是一个贱货，你给我们丢脸，你滚蛋吧！’事情就这样成了定局，我同意给她安排一下婚事……啊！我的最后希望成了泡影，哎，我曾经在她身上做过好多美梦！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她们听见一阵吵架的声音，便站起来看看。原来是乔治隐隐约约听见人群中有人诽谤旺德夫尔，他在为他辩护。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “为什么说他放弃了他的马呢，”乔治嚷道，“昨天在赛马总会里，他还为吕西尼昂押上一千金路易呢。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “确有其事，当时我也在场，”菲利普作证说，“他在娜娜身上一个金路易也没有押……如果娜娜的牌价升到一比十，这与他毫无关系。说人家有那么多的计谋，是非常可笑的。这样说有什么好处呢？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 拉博德特静静地听着，耸耸肩膀，说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “算了吧，让人家去说吧……伯爵刚才还押了五百金路易在吕西尼昂身上，他在娜娜的身上押上百来个金路易，这是因为马的主人总是要显示出相信自己的马会取胜的样子嘛。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “真见鬼！这跟我们有什么关系！”拉法卢瓦兹摆动着胳膊嚷道，“获胜的马将是精灵……法国将吃败仗！英国一定获胜！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 赛马场上又响起一阵钟声，宣布赛马已进入跑道，人群中又出现长时间的骚动。为了看得更清楚些，娜娜站到马车的座位上，把勿忘我花和玫瑰花都踩坏了。她向四周远眺，广阔的地平线尽收眼底。在观众急切盼望比赛开始的最后时刻，跑道上依然空荡荡的，未见到一匹赛马，跑道被灰色的栅栏关闭着，每隔两根柱子，站着两名警察。在她面前的一块长条状草地上，靠近她的地方满是污泥，越往远看草地越绿，最后看上去很像一片嫩绿色的地毯。然后她低下头来，把目光转到场地中央，只见草坪上人满为患，个个踮起脚尖，有人爬到马车上，人人兴奋不已，互相推推搡搡，挺直身子观望。他们的马匹发出嘶鸣，帐篷噼噼啪啪作响，骑马者驱马在步行者中间奔跑，步行者奔向栅栏，趴在栅栏上面观望。她又把目光转向另一边，朝看台望去，只见一张张面孔都变小了，密密麻麻的人头五颜六色，布满了过道、阶梯和平台，在蓝天下，呈现出一层层黑色的轮廓。再往前看，跑马场的周围是一片平川。右边，在爬满长春藤的磨坊后面，是一片低洼的草地，上面有一片片大的树荫；正面，公园里的林荫道纵横交错，一直延伸到塞纳河边，塞纳河在一座山丘下流过，林荫道上停放着一排排马车；然后向左边布洛涅森林方向望去，视野又开阔了，一条大路延伸到默车那边的蔚蓝天际，中间被一条两旁植满泡桐树的小径隔断，泡桐树还未长出叶子来，树梢上呈现粉红色，看上去一片鲜艳光泽。这时人们还不断拥来，人流像一群蚂蚁，沿着一条带状的狭长道路，穿过田野，从那边过来，而在巴黎方向那边很远的地方，那些没有买入场券的观众，像羊群一样集中在大树下，在布洛涅森林的边缘，看过去像一条由无数黑点组成的流动线。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在广阔的天空下，十万如痴如醉的观众聚集在这块土地上，像昆虫一样动个不停。倏然一阵欢乐的气氛使他们振奋起来。太阳在云层里隐没了一刻钟，现在又出来了，太阳洒下一大片光线，宛如一泓粼粼湖水。一切都重放光明，妇女们的阳伞像无数金光灿烂的盾牌。人们为太阳出来而鼓掌叫好，用笑声来向它致意，伸出胳膊，好像要用手臂来拨开乌云似的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时候，一位治安官员独自走在阒无一人的跑道中间。左边更远处，出现了一个人，手举一面红旗。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “那是起跑发令员德·莫里亚克男爵。”拉博德特回答提的问题。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜的身边挤满了男人，有的男人站在她的马车的踏脚板上，他们发出欢呼声，不停地讲话，凭着各人自己的印象，想到什么说什么。菲利普、乔治、博尔德纳夫和拉法卢瓦兹一分一秒也不住口。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “别推推搡搡了！……让我看看……啊！裁判员走进他的岗亭了……你说他是德·苏维尼先生？……嗯？在这样的比赛中，要有好眼力才能看清抢先半个马头的距离！……住嘴吧，举旗子了……赛马出来了，注意！……头一匹出来的是科西尼。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 一面红黄两色旗在旗杆上迎风飘场。马夫牵着一匹匹赛马进入场地，骑师们坐在马鞍上，垂着手臂，他们在阳光的照射下，像一个个明亮的斑点。紧接在科西尼后面的是幸运和布姆。接着，一阵低语声迎来了精灵，这是一匹漂亮的枣红大马，号衣的颜色很不柔和，是柠檬色和黑色，具有英国的阴森色调。瓦勒里奥二世的入场博得观众一阵喝彩，它的个头小巧，但是精神很足，号衣是嫩绿色，镶着粉红色花边。旺德夫尔的两匹马还迟迟不出场。最后，在杏仁奶油之后，出现了蓝白两色的号衣。吕西尼昂是一匹深毛色的枣红马，体态无可挑剔，但是由于娜娜引人注目，它几乎完全被人忘记。娜娜从来没有像现在这样漂亮，在金色阳光下，这匹栗色小母马颇像一位金发女郎。它像一玫崭新的金路易在阳光下闪闪发亮，它的胸部深陷，头颈轻盈，背部细长而灵敏。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “瞧！它的毛色同我的头发一样！”娜娜兴奋得叫起来，“喂，你们知道，我为此而自豪！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 人们都往她的马车上爬，博尔德纳夫差点踩到小路易的身上，妈妈已经把孩子忘了。博尔德纳夫像慈父一样埋怨没人照管小路易，他把他抱起来，然后举到肩上，喃喃说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “可怜的小家伙，应当让他也看看……等一下，我让你看看你妈妈……看见了吗？看那边，就是那匹马。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时，小狗珍宝跑过来抓他的腿，他把它也抱起来；娜娜对小母马取了自己的名字而自鸣得意，她扫视了一下其余的女人，想看看她们对此反应怎样。每个女人对娜娜都恨得要命。坐在出租马车里的老虔婆拉特里贡一直没动弹一下，这时候她在人群上面向一个赌注登记人挥挥手，叫他登记她的赌注，她已预感到了，她应当押娜娜。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 拉法卢瓦兹这时吵吵嚷嚷，叫人难以忍受，他一时看好了杏仁奶油。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我突然想到，”他连声说道，“你们瞧杏仁奶油，怎么样？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 它多灵活！……我以一比八押杏仁奶油，谁还押它？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “你安静一点好吧，”拉博德特终于说道，“你会后悔的。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “杏仁奶油是匹劣马，”菲利普说道，“它浑身出汗了…… \\n\\n \\n\\n 你等会看它试跑吧。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 赛马都回到右边，开始试跑，跑到看台前时，都散开了，拉开了距离。于是，观众的观看热情再次高涨，大家一起议论起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “吕西尼昂的背太长了，不过竞技状态还好……你知道，瓦勒里奥二世一个子儿也不能押，它很紧张，跑时头抬得高高的，这是不祥之兆……瞧！骑在精灵身上的是布尔纳……我告诉你，布尔纳垂肩膀，而骑师的肩膀好坏是至关重要的……不行，这很明显，精灵精神很不足……听我说，我可看见过娜娜，它在跑完良种幼马大奖赛后，浑身流汗，毛全粘在身上，喘得肋部要裂开来，我敢拿二十个金路易来打赌，它准排不上名次！……够了！这个家伙真讨厌，他一股劲儿吹嘘他的杏仁奶油！现在押赌注迟了，就要开始跑啦。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 拉法卢瓦兹正在拼命找一个赌注登记人，他急得几乎哭起来，人们只好劝劝他。人们都伸长脖子观看。第一次起跑不算，因为那个远远看去像个小黑点的发令员还没有放下手中的红旗马就跑了，赛马跑了一阵子后，全都回到起跑点。接着又有两次偷跑。最后发令员又把赛马集中到一起，他巧妙地发出信号，马都飞奔起来，博得一阵喝彩。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “好极了！……不，这次是碰巧！……不管怎样，总算跑成了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 欢呼声平息了下来，每个人都焦虑不安起来。现在，押赌注停止了，胜负就要在这宽阔的跑道上见分晓。开始一片寂静，观众好像都屏住了呼吸。一张张苍白的脸都抬得高高的，身上打着哆嗦。刚跑时，幸运和科西尼领先，跑在最前面；瓦勒里奥二世紧随其后，其余赛马跑得乱成一团。跑到看台前面时，犹如倏地刮起一阵暴风，把地面也震动了，马群已拉开四十匹马身长的距离。杏仁奶油落在最后面，娜娜紧紧跟在吕西尼昂和精灵的后面。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “真了不起！”拉博德特嘟囔道，“英国人想赶上去，跑得多起劲！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 在娜娜的车里，又发出说话声和欢呼声了。大家踮起脚尖，目光盯住奔驰的骑师，他们在阳光下，犹如一个个色彩鲜艳的斑点。上坡的时候，瓦勒里奥二世领先，科西尼和幸运落到了后面，吕西尼昂和精灵并驾齐驱，娜娜紧随其后。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “当然罗，英国人注定赢了，这是明显的事，”博尔德纳夫说道，“吕西尼昂已经精疲力竭了，瓦勒里奥二世已经支持不住了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “哎，要是英国人赢了，那就糟了！”菲利普大发爱国之心，痛苦地说道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 拥挤在那里的人群焦虑起来，这种心情使他们感到窒息。这一次又失败了！每个人心里都产生一种不寻常的、几乎虔诚的热情，希望吕西尼昂获胜；与此同时，人们哭丧着脸，咒骂精灵和它的骑师。散在草地上的人，三五成群，像一阵风似的奔跑起来，只见一双双鞋底在空中显现。骑师们从草坪上飞驰而过。娜娜慢慢地转动着身子，只见脚下的人畜似波涛，人头似海洋，被赛马卷起的旋风吹到了跑道旁边，向远处看去，骑师们像闪电一样划破地平线。她的目光紧紧盯着他们的背部，只见马屁股在逐渐远去，飞驰中伸长的马腿渐渐变小，甚至变得像头发丝那样纤细。现在，他们已经跑到了尽头，他们的侧影在远处布洛涅森林的绿色景色的衬托下，显得又小又细。然后他们突然被跑马场中间的一大片树丛遮挡住了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “得了吧！”乔治嚷道，他始终满怀信心，“现在还未跑完……英国人被赶上了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 但是拉法卢瓦兹轻视本国的情绪又抬头了，他变得令人气愤，他竟为精灵喝彩：好极了！跑得好！要给法国一点颜色看看！精灵第一，杏仁奶油第二！让它的祖国苦恼去吧！他把拉博德特惹火了，他严肃地警告拉法卢瓦兹，说如果他再这样，就把他扔到车下去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “看看他们要跑多少分钟。”博尔德纳夫平心静气地说。他抱着小路易，从口袋中掏出怀表。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 赛马一匹匹从树丛后面出现了。观众都愣住了，人群中嘁嘁喳喳议论了好长时间。瓦勒里奥二世仍然领先，但是精灵渐渐要赶上了它，精灵后面是吕西尼昂，它慢下来了，另外一匹马取代了它的位置。大家没有立刻分辨清楚，因为骑师的衣服的颜色很容易混淆。后来人群中发出了欢呼声。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “那是娜娜吧！……快跑，娜娜！我跟你说吕西尼昂已经跑不动了……啊！是的，那就是娜娜。一看见它那金黄色的鬃毛，便认出它来了……现在你看见了吧！它像一团火焰……好极了，娜娜！好家伙！……不过，这并不能说明什么，它不过在为吕西尼昂助威而已。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 有一阵子，这种意见竟变成了大家的意见。可是，小母马还一股劲儿往前跑，越来越领先了。于是，大家的热情高涨起来。谁也不看跑在后面的那些马了，一场激烈的较量在精灵、娜娜、吕西尼昂和瓦勒里奥二世之间展开了。人们叫它们的名字，他们絮絮叨叨，说这匹马快了多少，那匹马落后了多少。娜娜爬到车夫的座位上，像被人托起来似的，脸色苍白，浑身颤抖着，激动得说不出话来。拉博德特就在她的身边，他的脸上又露出了笑容。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “怎么样？英国马跑不动了，”菲利普高兴地说，“它不行了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “不管怎样，吕西尼昂完了，”拉法卢瓦兹大声嚷，“瓦勒里奥二世追上来了……瞧！四匹马跑到一起了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 每个人都说同样的话。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “跑得多快！伙计们！……跑得快极啦，真见鬼！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在，四匹马风驰电掣地迎着他们的面跑过来了。人们感到它们越来越近，好像远处的喘息声、鼾声越来越近。观众都迅猛拥到栅栏边；马还没有到，人们的胸膛里就发出一阵深深的呼叫声，叫声越来越大，犹如汹涌澎湃的海水声。这是一场数额巨大的赌博，已经进入最后的激烈争夺，十万观众的心中都怀着一个念头，都急于看看自己的运气怎样，在这些奔跑的马的后面，有数百万的输赢。人们互相推推搡搡，互相挤压，人人捏紧拳头，张着嘴巴都在用喊声和手势驱赶自己押赌的马快跑。整个人群的喊声，是从穿礼服的人中间发出来的野兽般的喊声，越来越清晰： \\n\\n \\n\\n “它们跑过来了！它们跑过来了！……它们跑过来了！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜更加领先了，现在瓦勒里奥二世被它抛在后头两三颈远，它与精灵并驾齐驱了。那雷鸣般的奔跑声越来越响。它们跑过来了，娜娜的马车上发出一阵暴风雨般的咒骂声，以此来迎接它们。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “吁，吕西尼昂，你是孬种，该死的劣马！……太棒了，英国人！再快一些，再快一些，老家伙！……这个瓦勒里奥二世真令人讨厌！……啊！这废物！我的十个金路易扔下水啦！…… \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在只有娜娜了！好极了！娜娜！好极了！小母马！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜站在马车夫的座位上，不由自主地扭起大腿和腰部来，仿佛她自己在跑。她不时挺挺肚子，这样似乎有助于小母马跑的速度。她每挺一下肚子，都感到疲倦，叹一口气，用低沉的声音费力地说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “快跑……快跑……快跑……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时大家看见一个精彩的场面。普里斯站在马镫上，用铁一般的胳膊，高高扬起马鞭，抽打娜娜。这个干瘪的老小孩，那张冷酷、毫无生气的长脸上仿佛在喷射着火焰。在一种狂热的大胆、必胜的信心的激励下，他把自己的心愿寄托在这匹小母马的身上，他把它抽打得腾空而起，向前飞跃，口吐白沫，眼睛充血。全部赛马风驰电掣而过，扬起一阵风，人们屏住呼吸；这时裁判员显得非常镇静，目光注视着标杆，在等待着。接着，听见一阵震天动地的欢呼声。普里斯尽了最大的努力，驱赶娜娜冲过标杆，以领先一头的距离胜了精灵。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时，场上人声鼎沸，犹如海水发出的波涛声。娜娜！娜娜！娜娜！喊声震耳，越来越响，犹如暴风骤雨，渐渐扩展到天际，从布洛涅森林深处传到瓦莱里安山，从隆尚草原传到布洛涅平原。草坪上爆发了一阵疯狂的叫喊声。娜娜万岁！法兰西万岁！打倒英国！妇女们挥动着阳伞，一些男人跳跃着，转动着身子，狂呼狂嚷；另一些男人发出神经质般的笑声，向空中扔帽子。在跑道的另一边，在体重过磅处的围墙内也沸腾起来了，看台上沸反盈天，人们只见拥挤的人群上空，空气在隐隐约约地颤动，犹如一堆炭火发出的看不见的火焰。一张张小脸上激动不已，他们挥动着胳膊，眼睛像一个个黑点，张着嘴巴。这种热情经久不息，不停高涨，一直蔓延到远处小径的尽头，蔓延到聚集在树荫下的人群中间，甚至扩展到皇家看台上，那里的人也很兴奋，皇后也鼓掌了。娜娜！娜娜！娜娜！喊声在灿烂的阳光中回荡着，阳光像金色的雨点洒在头晕目眩的观众的头上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时候，娜娜站在马车上车夫的座位上，看上去变得高大了，她以为观众欢呼的是她自己。她一动不动地呆了一阵子，被她的胜利惊呆了，她注视着被人流占满的跑道，人群是那样密集，连草都看不见了，映入眼帘的是一片黑帽子的海洋。接着，人群站到跑道的一边，形成一道人墙，一直延伸到出口处，再次向娜娜欢呼致意。娜娜驮着普里斯离去，普里斯伏在马背上，疲惫不堪，茫然若失。娜娜忘乎所以，使劲拍大腿，得意洋洋，粗言粗语地说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！他妈的！是我胜利了！可是……啊！他妈的！运气真好！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她不知道如何表达自己心潮起伏的心情，看见小路易高高坐在博尔德纳夫的肩上，便一把紧紧抓住他，一股劲儿地亲吻起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “三分十四秒。”博尔德纳夫说道，一边把表放进口袋里。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜总是听到观众喊她的名字，喊声在整个平原上荡漾，回声又传到她的耳畔。这是她的人民在向她欢呼，她则屹立在阳光下，披散着星辰般的秀发，身着与天空浑然一色的蓝白两色的连衣裙，俯视着她的人民。拉博德特离开她时告诉她，她赢了两千金路易，因为他把她的五十金路易押在小母马的身上，比数是一比四十。这笔钱固然使她激动，但还比不上这个意外获得的胜利令她兴奋，因为这个辉煌的胜利使她一举成了巴黎的王后。其余妇女都输了。罗丝·米尼翁一气之下折断了阳伞；卡罗利娜·埃凯、克拉利瑟、西蒙娜和不顾儿子在场的吕西·斯图华见这个胖婊子走了运，个个怒不可遏，悄声咒骂她。这时候，在赛马起跑时和到达终点时画过十字的拉特里贡挺着高大的、高出其余女人的身子，为自己的敏感嗅觉而洋洋得意，露出经验丰富的老虔婆的神态为娜娜祝福。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 男人们还在不断地拥向娜娜马车的周围。车上一伙人歇斯底里地狂叫了一阵子。乔治像哽住似的，一个人继续用嘶哑的嗓子叫喊。香槟酒喝光了，菲利普便带着几个听差，去饮料摊上买饮料。娜娜宫廷的人越来越多了，迟迟不肯过来的人见她胜利了，也决定来了。人们纷纷拥过来，顿时她的马车变成了整个草坪的中心，最后她竟被她的狂热的臣民尊为神棗爱神王后。博尔德纳夫在她的身后，怀着慈祥的父爱，嘴里骂着粗话。斯泰内再次被她征服了，他抛开了西蒙娜，爬到娜娜马车的一个踏脚板上。香槟酒拿来了，娜娜举起斟得满满的酒杯，这时人群中响起热烈的掌声，大家反复高呼：娜娜！娜娜！娜娜！观众都很惊讶，环顾周围，寻找那匹小母马。大家都弄糊涂了，自己心里所装的究竟是那匹马，还是那个女人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 米尼翁不顾罗丝凶狠的目光，也跑来了。这个走运的女子令他神魂颠倒，他很想上去吻她一下。接着，他在她的两边面颊上吻了吻，慈父般地对她说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “我烦恼的是，现在罗丝肯定要把那封信寄出去……她气坏了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “那就太好啦！我巴不得这样！”娜娜随口说道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 她见米尼翁发愣，连忙又说道： \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！不对！我刚才说了什么？……说实话，我不知道自己说了什么！……我有点醉了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她的确醉了，她被欢乐陶醉了，被阳光陶醉了。她一直高举着酒杯，为自己欢呼。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “为娜娜干杯！为娜娜干杯！”她喊道，四边的喧闹声、笑声、喝彩声越来越高，渐渐响遍了跑马场。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 赛马接近尾声了。现在进行沃布朗奖赛。马车一辆接一辆离去。这时，人们争吵起来，不断提到旺德夫尔这个名字。现在真相大白了：两年来，旺德夫尔一直在准备这一着棋，他让格雷沙姆看住娜娜，不让它出来，只让吕西尼昂露面，以便让小母马最后一举闻名。赌输的人个个垂头丧气，赢的人则耸耸肩膀。到后来呢？难道这不是允许的吗？马的主人可以随意调配他的赛马，这样的事例不是很多吗！绝大部分人认为旺德夫尔很有一手，他能通过朋友们找来足够下赌注的人，把大笔赌注押在娜娜身上，这就是娜娜牌价突然上升的原因；有人说他下了两千金路易，平均比数是一比三十，一共赢得一百二十万法郎。如此惊人的数字足以令人吃惊得对他肃然起敬，并原谅他的一切。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 然而，人们都在窃窃私语，谈论着从体重过磅处围墙里传来的坏消息。从那儿回来的人们这个消息说得很详细；人们纷纷议论起来，高声谈着一件可怕的丑闻。这个可怜的旺德夫尔可完蛋了。他干了一件蠢事，用了愚蠢的舞弊手段，这导致了他那高明的一招的失败。他委托不可靠的赌注登记人马雷夏尔替自己押四万法郎，赌吕西尼昂跑输，以便捞回他公开下的两万多法郎的赌注，这是一种卑鄙的做法，证明他的面临彻底破产的财产又露出了一条裂缝。那个赌注登记人得知吕西尼昂不会跑赢，于是在这匹马身上赚了六万法郎。不过，拉博德特没有得到旺德夫尔的任何准确而详细的指示，偏偏跑去向赌注登记人下了二百金路易在娜娜身上，由于马雷夏尔不知这一招的真正用意，继续以一比五十的比数押出，结果在小母马身上输了十万法郎，抵销六万法郎赢数，实输四万法郎。马雷夏尔感到头晕目眩，比赛结束后，看见拉博德特和旺德夫尔在体重过磅厅里交谈，他突然恍然大悟。这个昔日的马车夫，觉得自己上当受骗了，勃然大怒，露出凶相，他公开大吵大闹，用冷酷的字眼揭露这件事情的内幕，煽动周围的人。有人说赛马评委会将开会处理这件事。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 菲利普和乔治悄声告诉娜娜这个消息，于是她信口说出自己的想法，但仍然不停地笑着，不停地喝酒。不管怎样，这是很可能的。她还联想到与此有关的事情；何况这个马雷夏尔有一副卑鄙的面孔。不过，她还有几分怀疑。这时拉博德特来了，他面色苍白。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “怎么样？”娜娜悄声问道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “完蛋了！”他简单回答道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 说完，他耸耸肩膀。这个旺德夫尔简直是个孩子！娜娜做了一个不耐烦的手势。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 晚上，在马比耶舞厅里，娜娜大出风头。将近十点钟时，娜娜来了，那里已经人声鼎沸。这个传统的狂欢晚会把所有风流青年都聚集到一起，上流社会的人蜂拥而至，他们的行动像下等人一样粗俗、愚蠢。大家在煤气彩灯下挤来挤去；黑色礼服，袒胸露肩的奇装异服，还有耐脏的旧裙子全都混杂在一起，人们旋转着，叫嚷着，人人醉醺醺的。三十步远处的铜管乐声都听不见。没有一个人在跳舞，胡言乱语在一群群人中传着，不知道为什么要反复说这些话。谁都想表现得滑稽可笑，但是总是毫无效果，白费力气。七个女人被关在衣帽间里，哭闹着要求把她们放出来。有人找来一棵葱，进行拍卖，竟被人加价到两个金路易。恰恰就在这时候，娜娜来了，她身上仍然穿着观看赛马时的蓝白两色衣服。在雷鸣般的掌声中，大家把那棵葱给了她。不管她愿意不愿意，有人把她一把抓住，三个欣喜若狂的男人把她举起来，穿过被踩得乱七八糟的草坪和遭破坏的树丛，一直抬到花园里；因为乐队挡住了他们的去路，他们便向乐队扑过去，砸碎了椅子和乐谱架。一名像慈父一样的警察在那里指挥这场混战。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 直到星期二，娜娜才从胜利的兴奋中平静下来。早上勒拉太太来了，娜娜与她谈起来。她是来告诉娜娜小路易的情况的，小路易在外面着了凉，生病了。目前有一则新闻轰动整个巴黎，娜娜听后，心里很不平静。旺德夫尔被开除出赛马场，这项决定是在赛马当天晚上，在皇家俱乐部宣布的，第二天他便在他的马厩里放了一把火，自己与马匹同归于尽了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “他早就对我说过，他要这样死。”娜娜说道，“这个人真正是个疯子！……昨天晚上我知道这个消息时，我被吓坏了。你知道，他简直能杀死我，一天夜里……另外，他哪一匹马能跑赢也不告诉我一声，这样做对吗？如果告诉我，我至少能发一笔财！……他对拉博德特说过，如果让我知道了，我就会立即告诉我的理发师和许多男人。这话说得多么不礼貌！……啊！ \\n\\n \\n\\n 不，说实话，对他的死我也不怎么惋惜。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她越想越生气。恰巧这时候，拉博德特走进来；他已算好了帐，给娜娜送来四万法郎。她见了这笔钱，更是火上加油，因为她本来可以赢一百万法郎，对于这次投机勾当，拉博德特装得一身清白，干脆抛弃了旺德夫尔。这些古老家族早就徒有其名了，最后都落得这样愚蠢的结局。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！不对，”娜娜说道，“把自己关在马厩里自焚，这种做法并不算愚蠢，我倒觉得这样是挺有勇气的……啊！你知道，他与马雷夏尔的那件纠葛，我并不为他辩护。我一想到布朗瑟想把这件事的责任推给我，我就回答说：‘难道我叫他去舞弊的吗？’一个女人向一个男人讨钱，并不是叫他去犯罪，你说是吗？如果他对我说：‘我一个子儿也没有了’，我就会对他说，‘行了，我们分手吧。’这样事情就不会糟到这个地步。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “一点不错，”姑妈严肃地说，“男人固执己见，他们倒霉活该。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “不过他那略具喜庆色彩的结局倒是很精彩的！”娜娜又说，“看上去很可怕，令人毛骨悚然。他把所有人都打发走，把自己关在马厩里，浇上汽油……接着烧起来，此景值得一看！可以想象，一个几乎完全是木质结构的庞然大物，里面又堆满麦秸和干草！……火焰蹿得有宝塔一般高……最壮观的，是那些不愿被活活烧死的马。只听见它们尥着蹶子，拼命撞门，像人一样喊叫……是的，人们对这幕可怖情景还心有余悸呢。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 拉博德特轻轻舒了口气，样子像将信将疑。他不相信旺德夫尔已经死了。有人发誓说，亲眼看见他从一扇窗户逃了出去。他是一时神经错乱才点火烧马厩的。不过，到被烧到不能忍受时，他神智清醒了。一个在女人圈子里鬼混、落到囊空如洗境地的蠢男人是不会这样勇敢自杀的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 娜娜听后很扫兴，只说了一句： \\n\\n \\n\\n “啊！他真不幸！他的行为真高尚！” \\n\\n
