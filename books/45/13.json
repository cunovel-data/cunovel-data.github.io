{"id":1237,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"At the dessert the women themselves made some delicate and discreet allusions．Their eyes glistened；they had drunk much．The Count，who preserved，even in his flights，his grand appearance of gravity，made a comparison，much relished，upon the subject of those wintering at the pole，and the joy of ship－wrecked sailors who saw an opening toward the south． \n \n Loiseau suddenly arose，a glass of champagne in his hand，and said：“I drink to our deliverance．”Everybody was on his feet；they shouted in agreement．Even the two good sisters consented to touch their lips to the froth of the wine which they had never before tasted．They declared that it tasted like charged lemonade， only much nicer． \n \n Loiseau resumed：“It is unfortunate that we have no piano，for we might make up a quadrille．” \n \n Cornudet had not said a word，nor made a gesture；he appeared plunged in very grave thoughts，and made sometimes a furious motion，so that his great beard seemed to wish to free itself．Finally，toward midnight，as they were separating，Loiseau，who was staggering，touched him suddenly on the stomach and said to him in a stammer：“You are not very funny，this evening；you have said nothing，citizen！”Then Cornudet raised his head brusquely and，casting a brilliant，terrible glance around the company， said：“ I tell you all that you have been guilty of infamy！”He rose，went to the door，and again repeated：“Infamy，I say！”and disappeared． \n \n This made a coldness at first．Loiseau，interlocutor，was stupefied；but he recovered immediately and laughed heartily as he said：“He is very green，my friends．He is very green．”And then，as they did not comprehend，he told them about the“mysteries of the corridor．”Then there was a return of gaiety．The women behaved like lunatics．The Count and Mr．Carré-Lamadon wept from the force of their laughter．They could not believe it． \n \n “How is that？Are you sure？” \n \n “I tell you I saw it．” \n \n “And she refused—” \n \n “Yes，because the Prussian officer was in the next room．” \n \n “Impossible！” \n \n “I swear it！” \n \n The Count was stifled with laughter．The industrial gentleman held his sides with both hands．Loiseau continued： \n \n “And now you understand why he saw nothing funny this evening！No，nothing at all！”And the three started out half ill，suffocated． \n \n They separated．But Mrs．Loiseau，who was of a spiteful nature，remarked to her husband as they were getting into bed，that“that grisette” of a little Carré-Lamadom was yellow with envy all the evening．“You know，” she continued，“how some women will take to a uniform，whether it be French or Prussian！It is all the same to them！Oh！what a pity！” \n \n And all night，in the darkness of the corridor，there were to be heard light noises，like whisperings and walking in bare feet，and imperceptible creakings．They did not go to sleep until late，that is sure，for there were threads of light shining under the doors for a long time．The champagne had its effect；they say it troubles sleep． \n \n The next day a clear winter\u0027s sun made the snow very brilliant．The diligence，already harnessed，waited before the door，while an army of white pigeons，in their thick plumage，with rose－colored eyes，with a black spot in the center，walked up and down gravely among the legs of the six horses，seeking their livelihood in the manure there scattered． \n \n The driver，enveloped in his sheepskin，had a lighted pipe under the seat，and all the travelers，radiant，were rapidly packing some provisions for the rest of the journey．They were only waiting for Ball－of－Fat．Finally she appeared． \n \n She seemed a little troubled，ashamed． And she advanced timidly toward her companions，who all，with one motion， turned as if they had not seen her．The Conut，with dignity，took the arm of his wife and re-moved her from this impure contact． \n \n The fat girl stopped，half stupefied；then，plucking up courage，she approached the manufacturer\u0027s wife with“Good morning，Madame，”humbly murmured．The lady made a slight bow of the head which she accompanied with a look of outraged virtue．Everybody seemed busy，and kept themselves as far from her as if she had had some infectious disease in her skirts． Then they hurried into the carriage，where she came last，alone， and where she took the place she had occupied during the first part of the journey． \n \n They seemed not to see her or know her；although Madame Loiseau，Looking at her from afar，said to her husband in a half－tone：“Happily，I don\u0027 t have to sit be-side her．” \n \n The heavy carriage began to move and the remainder of the journey commenced．No one spoke at first．Ball－of－Fat dared not raise her eyes．She felt indignant toward all her neighbors，and at the same time humiliated at having yielded to the foul kisses of this Prussian，into whose arms they had hypocritically thrown her． \n \n
