His Mistress had a generous ass to go with that full bosom, a perfect little hourglass that was spinning him until he was dizzy. A blanket had been laid on the grass beneath one of the palms. Fiona stood by it. On first glance, Nathan thought she was rubbing suntan lotion on her tawny skin, but then she turned toward them. She was wearing a strap-on, greasing up a dildo of harrowing size fitted into it. The leopard was stretched out nearby, his tail flicking. The narrowed amber eyes watched the bob of the phallus as if he thought it was a toy. It made him uncomfortably aware of his own member, erect and bobbing quite liberally in its harness, enough to attract a cat’s attention. “Mistress.” He knew better than to lock his stance now, but he couldn’t help dragging his feet at the sight of that mammoth toy. “What—” “Jonathan, do you wish to be gagged again?” His jaw flexed. He managed to flick a sullen glance away from the phallus to her face when she stopped at the blanket and turned to face him. “I could hardly serve you properly that way, Mistress.” “No. But I could serve myself while Fiona fucks your ass and you have to watch. Would you rather your mouth have only that ball gag in it?” “No, Mistress.” “Then you’ll do my bidding and not speak unless I ask you a question. While you’re on your hands and knees eating me out, your ass will be high in the air and Fiona will be fucking it for my pleasure. It will hurt, so you won’t forget yourself and come. You’re not going to get to come until I say so, until it’s the only thing you can think about, until you believe it’s the only thing you’ve ever wanted. Tell me you understand.” Holding her gaze a moment more than was proper, he spoke softly. “The only thing I want in life is to serve my Mistress. To feel her pussy climaxing around my tongue.” She chuckled scornfully. “That was a well-used line if ever I’ve heard one. You need some new material.” “Or a permanent gag,” Fiona put in. “As he said, his mouth wouldn’t do me much good then, would it?” Dona teased as if they were two schoolgirls, instead of two women planning to split him in two with that huge dildo. “Come here.” She wrapped her hand in Fiona’s long hair, grasped her fingers with her other hand and brought the woman closer. Dona rubbed her face along the woman’s dusky cheek, freeing one hand to pass her fingers over Fiona’s lips. “Show this slave I’m more impressed with silence.” Fiona smiled, leaned in and took Dona’s lips in a kiss. Tracing his Mistress’s mouth with her tongue, the leopard-skinned woman put her hands to Dona’s waist, drew her closer. With eager passion, but also need, affection. There was an emotional exchange occurring as well as physical, telling him Dona had dominated this woman before. These women apparently served her in more ways than one. Like most men, his cock leaped at the sight of two women touching each other. However, as he watched Fiona’s hand caress Dona’s lower back, the swell of her hips, slide back up to the side of her breast and her neck to cup her jaw so she could deepen her kiss, something else rose in him. Anger. Jealousy. He wanted Fiona’s hands off Dona. Dona was his Mistress. When her tongue tangled with Dona’s, she made a sound of pleasure like a growl. Fiona moved closer, bumping the strap-on between Dona’s thighs, hinting at what else she could do for her. “Stop it. Stop it.” He surged forward, knocked Fiona away with his shoulder. She stumbled back, her eyes wide, telling him he’d finally been able to do something they didn’t expect. His satisfaction with that was short-lived, though, for he’d forgotten about her damn cat. The leopard snarled and swiped him. Nathan spun away, but not fast enough. The claws caught his upper thigh, raking four stripes through the skin as if it were tissue paper. Son of a bitch. He dropped to one knee, the only thing he could think of to protect his groin. A fetal ball would have been more advisable for that, but he wasn’t going to play submissive to an animal. As the cat laid his ears back, Nathan bared his teeth. Snarled. Prepared to body ram the creature if he leaped. Dona emitted a sharp command and the cat backed off, growling. Fiona put a hand on the spotted ruff, drawing her pet away, both sets of catlike eyes reflecting surprise. Then his Mistress caught his cock tether and yanked him to his feet, a pain he felt all the way to the root that distracted him from the throbbing in his leg. “Jesus—” “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” He lunged toward her, anticipating her second pull. His heart was hammering hard against his chest, making words impossible. There was no reason not to take advantage of the moment, though. He placed his mouth over her angry one, fell into her. Oh, God. Wet heat. Scent. Something so perfect he couldn’t describe it. He bit at her lips, needing to taste with more than just his tongue. He wanted to touch her so much he wished he was Samson who could break free of his bonds to draw her close. Touch her the way Fiona had. No, better than Fiona had. Draw her close, hold her completely against him, wrap his arms all the way around and feel her from neck to thigh, knowing she was all his. His Mistress. They’d dismissed him as if he were simply a misbehaving child. Even with his thigh smarting and knowing how close he’d just come to being disemboweled, he wouldn’t be dismissed. Not by her. Half a heartbeat of bliss and she shoved him away. Wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, she spat on the ground, making him flinch at the cruelty of the gesture. “You’ve lost your polish, Jonathan. You’re disobedient, rebellious. A pain in the ass. Not the perfect sub I remember hearing so much about.” “No, Mistress.” He knew all the moves, all the right things to say, but for some reason he couldn’t summon them. As he dropped to one knee before her, he prayed she’d have pity and give him some slack on that tether. She did, sparingly. He felt the strain as she kept his cock stretched, making him feel the pinch on his testicles. “I just don’t want anyone else touching you. I’m sorry. I guess I’ve become…messed up in prison. You tend… You have to fight to keep what’s yours. There isn’t any sharing.” It was as good an explanation as any, because he’d be damned if he could explain it himself. He bowed his head, staring at her bare feet, the dark wine-colored polish on her pretty toes. After a long, tense moment, those toes moved away. When Nathan raised his head, she was settling herself nearby on several pillows her ladies arranged for her, as if attending an empress before she was serviced by her favored pet. Fiona squatted before him, that massive strap-on brushing his quivering leg. She’d apparently recovered her aplomb, for with an impatient nudge of her knuckles against his inner thigh, she indicated she wanted both his knees on the ground and spread apart. When he reluctantly complied, she slapped a wet cloth on his thigh. The smell and the fiery burning told him it was soaked with alcohol. He bit the inside of his cheek to stay still and quiet and held her gaze with one as unflinching as her own. Once the dampness had molded the compress to his thigh, she hooked another tether to the cock harness, to the ring that was positioned beneath his scrotum. The pressure of her knuckles on the base of his cock made him leak another drop. Swiping her finger over it, she took it to the strap-on and rubbed it over the head, giving him a taunting look. When he curled his lip at her, she chuckled, gave him a hard slap along his dick that made him grit his teeth. Rising, she pulled off the compress and went behind him to thread the leash up between his buttocks and through the space between his folded and bound forearms. Her cold fingers wrapped around his throat as she held him steady to run the strap through several of the rings running along the back of the collar. Now he had a tether running from genitals to throat, a rein held snug on his back by his own manacled arms and Fiona’s ruthless hold, while Dona still held the tether attached to the harness around the base of his cock. As Dona began to reel in that tether, he had to walk awkwardly on his knees to her. Like a wild animal being led from a cage, one handler holding tension from behind while one maintained it forward. Dona spread her legs, showing him her pussy through the sheer fabric. Her fingers lay on her thigh, a whisper away from caressing herself. The sunlight glistened off the silken netting, denying him a fully unimpeded view. He had the unexpected thought he would walk on his knees forever to reach such an offering. He balked, despite his body’s scream of protest. Why was she affecting him this way? She’d come to get him at the prison because she wanted him. She’d said so. Why would that unbalance him so much? Other women had wanted him. Other women had wanted Jonathan Powell. She had come for Nathan. Fiona shoved him forward abruptly. Before he could land face first on the blanket, he was brought up short by her firm grip on the collar, her nails scratching his skin. Her brace against the tether put an aching tension from cock to arms to throat. The collar hobbled his air flow enough she could control him, but he hovered right over Dona’s cunt, his ass in the air as she’d described. In his current position, he could only stare at those pink folds of skin, the tender lips compressed behind the mesh. As he breathed shallowly, he could smell her arousal. That aroma matched the intent look of her eye, her parted wet mouth. Those beautiful breasts rose like gentle hills above the satin terrain of her abdomen. He could see the jutting nipples as she reclined. Straining forward like an eager dog in truth, he felt the muscles in his shoulders bunch with the effort. He cursed as a crop snapped sharply down on his flank. Mariah stood off to the side with it, tossing her red hair over her pale shoulder. “Behave, slave, or you’ll eat nothing but dirt.” When he snarled, they laughed at him, but he noted with satisfaction that Fiona decided to change her position. The woman’s tawny legs came down on either side of his hips, her thighs pressing against him to give her better leverage to hold him back.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mistress-of-redemption-nature-of-desire-5/page-7.html","bookId":1910,"book":{"id":1910,"title":"Mistress of Redemption (Nature of Desire #5)","description":"Storyline: Mistress of Redemption (Nature of Desire #5) The white-collar life Jonathan Powell created for himself is gone.
