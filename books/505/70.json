{"id":10728,"no":70,"title":"LXX BRER RABBIT RESCUES BRER TERRAPIN","content":"The arrival of the negroes from the River place added greatly to the enthusiasm with which the Christmas holidays were anticipated on the Home place, and the air was filled with laughter day and night. Uncle Remus appeared to be very busy, though there was really nothing to be done except to walk around and scold at everybody and everything, in a good-humored way, and this the old man could do to perfection. The night before Christmas eve, however, the little boy saw a light in Uncle Remus\u0027s cabin, and he interpreted it as in some sort a signal of invitation. He found the old man sitting by the fire and talking to himself:— \"Ef Mars John and Miss Sally \u0027specks me fer ter keep all deze yer niggers straight deyer gwine ter be diserp\u0027inted,—dat dey is. Ef dey wuz \u0027lev\u0027m Remuses \u0027t would n\u0027t make no diffunce, let \u0027long one po\u0027 ole cripple creetur lak me. Dey ain\u0027t done no damage yit, but I boun\u0027 you by termorrer night dey\u0027ll tu\u0027n loose en tu\u0027n de whole place upside down, en t\u0027ar it up by de roots, en den [326]atter hit\u0027s all done gone en done, yer\u0027ll come Miss Sally a-layin\u0027 it all at ole Remus do\u0027. Nigger ain\u0027t got much chance in deze yer low-groun\u0027s, mo\u0027 speshually w\u0027en dey gits ole en cripple lak I is.\" \"What are they going to do to-morrow night, Uncle Remus?\" the little boy inquired. \"Now w\u0027at make you ax dat, honey?\" exclaimed the old man, in a grieved tone. \"You knows mighty well how dey done las\u0027 year en de year \u0027fo\u0027 dat. Dey tuck\u0027n cut up \u0027roun\u0027 yer wuss\u0027n ef dey \u0027uz wil\u0027 creeturs, en termorrer night dey\u0027ll be a-hollin\u0027 en whoopin\u0027 en singin\u0027 en dancin\u0027 \u0027fo\u0027 it git dark good. I wish w\u0027en you go up ter de big house you be so good ez ter tell Miss Sally dat ef she want any peace er min\u0027 she better git off\u0027n de place en stay off twel atter deze yer niggers git dey fill er Chris\u0027mus. Goodness knows, she can\u0027t \u0027speck a ole cripple nigger lak me fer ter ketch holt en keep all deze yer niggers straight.\" Uncle Remus would have kept up his vague complaints, but right in the midst of them Daddy Jack stuck his head in at the door, and said:— \"Oona bin fix da\u0027 \u0027Tildy gal shoe. Me come fer git dem shoe; me come fer pay you fer fix dem shoe.\" Uncle Remus looked at the grinning old African in astonishment. Then suddenly the truth dawned upon him and he broke into a loud laugh. Finally he said:— \"Come in, Brer Jack! Come right \u0027long in. I\u0027m sorter po\u0027ly myse\u0027f, yit I\u0027ll make out ter make you welcome. Dey wuz a quarter dollar gwine inter my britches-pocket on de \u0027count er dem ar shoes, but ef youer gwine ter pay fer um \u0027t won\u0027t be but a sev\u0027mpunce.\" Somehow or other Daddy Jack failed to relish Uncle Remus\u0027s tone and manner, and he replied, with some display of irritation: \"Shuh-shuh! Me no come in no\u0027n \u0027t all. Me no pay you se\u0027mpunce. Me come fer pay you fer dem shoe; me come fer tek um \u0027way fum dey-dey.\" [327]\"I dunno \u0027bout dat, Brer Jack, I dunno \u0027bout dat. De las\u0027 time I year you en \u0027Tildy gwine on, she wuz \u0027pun de p\u0027ints er knockin\u0027 yo\u0027 brains out. Now den, s\u0027pozen I whirls in en gins you de shoes, en den \u0027Tildy come \u0027long en ax me \u0027bout um, w\u0027at I gwine say ter \u0027Tildy?\" \"Me pay you fer dem shoe,\" said Daddy Jack, seeing the necessity of argument, \"un me tek um wey da lil \u0027Tildy gal bin stay. She tell me fer come git-a dem shoe.\" \"Well, den, yer dey is,\" said Uncle Remus, sighing deeply as he handed Daddy Jack the shoes. \"Yer dey is, en youer mo\u0027 dan welcome, dat you is. But spite er dat, dis yer quarter you flingin\u0027 \u0027way on um would er done you a sight mo\u0027 good dan w\u0027at dem shoes is.\" This philosophy was altogether lost upon Daddy Jack, who took the shoes and shuffled out with a grunt of satisfaction. He had scarcely got out of hearing before \u0027Tildy pushed the door open and came in. She hesitated a moment, and then, seeing that Uncle Remus paid no attention to her, she sat down and picked at her fingers with an air quite in contrast to her usual \"uppishness,\" as Uncle Remus called it. \"Unk Remus,\" she said, after awhile, in a subdued tone, \"is dat old Affikin nigger bin yer atter dem ar shoes?\" \"Yas, chile,\" replied Uncle Remus, with a long-drawn sigh, \"he done bin yer en got um en gone. Yas, honey, he done got um en gone; done come en pay fer \u0027m, en got um en gone. I sez, sez I, dat I wish you all mighty well, en he tuck\u0027n tuck de shoes en put. Yas, chile, he done got um en gone.\" Something in Uncle Remus\u0027s sympathetic and soothing tone seemed to exasperate \u0027Tildy. She dropped her hands in her lap, straightened herself up and exclaimed:— \"Yas, I\u0027m is gwine ter marry dat ole nigger an\u0027 I don\u0027t keer who knows it. Miss Sally say she don\u0027t keer, en t\u0027er folks may keer ef dey wanter, en much good der keerin\u0027 \u0027ll do um.\" [328]\u0027Tildy evidently expected Uncle Remus to make some characteristic comment, for she sat and watched him with her lips firmly pressed together and her eyelids half-closed,—an attitude of defiance significant enough when seen, but difficult to describe. But the old man made no response to the challenge. He seemed to be very busy. Presently \u0027Tildy went on:— \"Somebody bleedz to take keer er dat ole nigger, en I dunner who gwine ter do it ef I don\u0027t. Somebody bleedz ter look atter \u0027im. Good win\u0027 come \u0027long hit \u0027ud in about blow \u0027im \u0027way ef dey wa\u0027n\u0027t somebody close \u0027roun\u0027 fer ter take keer un \u0027im. Let \u0027lone dat, I ain\u0027t gwineter have dat ole nigger man f\u0027ever \u0027n \u0027ternally trottin\u0027 atter me. I tell you de Lord\u0027s trufe, Unk Remus,\" continued \u0027Tildy, growing confidential, \"I ain\u0027t had no peace er min\u0027 sence dat ole nigger man come on dis place. He des bin a-pacin\u0027 at my heels de whole blessed time, en I bleedz ter marry \u0027im fer git rid un \u0027im.\" \"Well,\" said Uncle Remus, \"hit don\u0027t s\u0027prize me. You marry en den youer des lak Brer Fox wid he bag. You know w\u0027at you put in it, but you dunner w\u0027at you got in it.\" \u0027Tildy flounced out without waiting for an explanation, but the mention of Brother Fox attracted the attention of the little boy, and he wanted to know what was in the bag, how it came to be there, and all about it. \"Now, den,\" said Uncle Remus, \"hit\u0027s a tale, en a mighty long tale at dat, but I\u0027ll des hatter cut it short, \u0027kaze termorrer night you\u0027ll wanter be a-settin\u0027 up lis\u0027nen at de kyar\u0027n\u0027s on er dem ar niggers, w\u0027ich I b\u0027leeve in my soul dey done los\u0027 all de sense dey ever bin bornded wid. \"One time Brer Fox wuz gwine on down de big road, en he look ahead en he see ole Brer Tarrypin makin\u0027 he way on todes home. Brer Fox \u0027low dis a mighty good time fer ter nab ole Brer Tarrypin, en no sooner is he thunk it dan he put out back home, w\u0027ich \u0027t wa\u0027n\u0027t but a little ways, en he git \u0027im a bag. He come back, he [329]did, en he run up behime ole Brer Tarrypin en flip \u0027im in de bag en sling de bag \u0027cross he back en go gallin\u0027-up back home. \"Brer Tarrypin, he holler, but \u0027t ain\u0027t do no good, he rip en he r\u0027ar, but \u0027t ain\u0027t do no good. Brer Fox des keep on a-gwine, en \u0027t wa\u0027n\u0027t long \u0027fo\u0027 he had ole Brer Tarrypin slung up in de cornder in de bag, en de bag tied un hard en fas\u0027. \"But w\u0027iles all dis gwine on,\" exclaimed Uncle Remus, employing the tone and manner of some country preacher he had heard, \"whar wuz ole Brer Rabbit? Yasser—dats it, whar wuz he? En mo\u0027n dat, w\u0027at you \u0027speck he \u0027uz doin\u0027 en whar you reckon he wer\u0027 gwine? Dat\u0027s de way ter talk it; whar\u0027bouts wuz he?\" The old man brought his right hand down upon his knee with a thump that jarred the tin-plate and cups on the mantel-shelf, and then looked around with a severe frown to see what the chairs and the work-bench, and the walls and the rafters, had to say in response to his remarkable argument. He sat thus in a waiting attitude a moment, and then, finding that no response came from anything or anybody, his brow gradually cleared, and a smile of mingled pride and satisfaction spread over his face, as he continued in a more natural tone:— \"Youk\u0027n b\u0027leeve me er not b\u0027leeve des ez youer min\u0027 ter, but dat ar long-year creetur—dat ar hoppity-skippity—dat ar up-en-down-en-sailin\u0027-\u0027roun\u0027 Brer Rabbit, w\u0027ich you bin year me call he name \u0027fo\u0027 dis, he wa\u0027n\u0027t so mighty fur off w\u0027iles Brer Fox gwine \u0027long wid dat ar bag slung \u0027cross he back. Let \u0027lone dat, Brer Rabbit \u0027uz settin\u0027 right dar in de bushes by de side er de road, en w\u0027ence he see Brer Fox go trottin\u0027 by, he ax hisse\u0027f w\u0027at is it dat creetur got in dat ar bag. \"He ax hisse\u0027f, he did, but he dunno. He wunder en he wunder, yit de mo\u0027 he wunder de mo\u0027 he dunno. Brer Fox, he go trottin\u0027 by, en Brer Rabbit, he sot in de bushes en wunder. Bimeby he \u0027low ter hisse\u0027f, he did, dat Brer Fox ain\u0027t got no busi[330]ness fer ter be trottin\u0027 \u0027long down de road, totin\u0027 doin\u0027s w\u0027ich yuther folks dunner w\u0027at dey is, en he \u0027low dat dey won\u0027t be no great harm done ef he take atter Brer Fox en fine out w\u0027at he got in dat ar bag. \"Wid dat, Brer Rabbit, he put out. He ain\u0027t got no bag fer ter tote, en he pick up he foots mighty peart. Mo\u0027n dat, he tuck\u0027n tuck a nigh-cut, en by de time Brer Fox git home, Brer Rabbit done had time fer ter go \u0027roun\u0027 by de watermillion-patch en do some er he devilment, en den atter dat he tuck\u0027n sot down in de bushes whar he kin see Brer Fox w\u0027en he come home. \"Bimeby yer come Brer Fox wid de bag slung \u0027cross he back. He onlatch de do\u0027, he did, en he go in en sling Brer Tarrypin down in de cornder, en set down front er de h\u0027ath fer ter res\u0027 hisse\u0027f.\" Here Uncle Remus paused to laugh in anticipation of what was to follow. \"Brer Fox ain\u0027t mo\u0027n lit he pipe,\" the old man continued, after a tantalizing pause, \"\u0027fo\u0027 Brer Rabbit stick he head in de do\u0027 en holler:— \"Brer Fox! O Brer Fox! You better take yo\u0027 walkin\u0027-cane en run down yan. Comin\u0027 \u0027long des now I year a mighty fuss, en I look \u0027roun\u0027 en dar wuz a whole passel er folks in yo\u0027 watermillion-patch des a-tromplin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027 en a-t\u0027arin\u0027 down.

You better make \u0027a\u0027se, Brer Fox, ef you wanter git de good er yo\u0027 watermillions. Run, Brer Fox! run!\u0027 \"Wid dat Brer Rabbit dart back in de bushes, en Brer Fox drap he pipe en grab he walkin\u0027-cane en put out fer he watermillion-patch, w\u0027ich \u0027t wer\u0027 down on de branch; en no sooner is he gone dan ole Brer Rabbit come out de bushes en make he way in de house. \"He go so easy dat he ain\u0027t make no fuss; he look \u0027roun\u0027 en dar [331]wuz de bag in de cornder. He kotch holt er de bag en sorter feel un it, en time he do dis, he year sump\u0027n\u0027 holler:— \"\u0027Ow! Go \u0027way! Lem me \u0027lone! Tu\u0027n me loose! Ow!\u0027 \"Brer Rabbit jump back \u0027stonish\u0027d. Den \u0027fo\u0027 you kin wink yo\u0027 eye-ball, Brer Rabbit slap hisse\u0027f on de leg en break out in a laugh. Den he up\u0027n \u0027low:— \"\u0027Ef I ain\u0027t make no mistakes, dat ar kinder fuss kin come fum nobody in de roun\u0027 worl\u0027 but ole Brer Tarrypin.\u0027 \"Brer Tarrypin, he holler, sezee: \u0027Ain\u0027t dat Brer Rabbit?\u0027 \"\u0027De same,\u0027 sezee. \"\u0027Den whirl in en tu\u0027n me out.

Brer Rabbit, he holler back:— \"\u0027Youer lots smarter dan w\u0027at I is, Brer Tarrypin—lots smarter. Youer smarter en pearter. Peart ez I come yer, you is ahead er me. I know how you git in de bag, but I dunner how de name er goodness you tie yo\u0027se\u0027f up in dar, dat I don\u0027t.\u0027 \"Brer Tarrypin try ter splain, but Brer Rabbit keep on laughin\u0027, en he laugh twel he git he fill er laughin\u0027; en den he tuck\u0027n ontie de bag en take Brer Tarrypin out en tote \u0027im \u0027way off in de woods. Den, w\u0027en he done dis, Brer Rabbit tuck\u0027n run off en git a great big hornet-nes\u0027 w\u0027at he see w\u0027en he comin\u0027 long—\" \"A hornet\u0027s nest, Uncle Remus?\" exclaimed the little boy, in amazement. \"Tooby sho\u0027, honey. \u0027T ain\u0027t bin a mont\u0027 sence I brung you a great big hornet-nes\u0027, en yer you is axin\u0027 dat. Brer Rabbit tuck\u0027n slap he han\u0027 \u0027cross de little hole whar de hornets goes in at, en dar he had um. Den he tuck\u0027n tuck it ter Brer Fox house, en put it in de bag whar Brer Tarrypin bin. \"He put de hornet-nes\u0027 in dar,\" continued Uncle Remus, lowering his voice, and becoming very grave, \"en den he tie up [332]de bag des lak he fine it. Yit \u0027fo\u0027 he put de bag back in de cornder, w\u0027at do dat creetur do?
