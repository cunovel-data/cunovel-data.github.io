{"id":10683,"no":25,"title":"XXIV HOW BRER RABBIT GOT THE MEAT","content":"When the little boy next visited Uncle Remus the cabin was dark and empty and the door shut. The old man was gone. He was absent for several nights, but at last one night the little boy saw a welcome light in the cabin, and he made haste to pay Uncle Remus a visit. He was full of questions:— \"Goodness, Uncle Remus! Where in the world have you been? I thought you were gone for good. Mamma said she reckoned the treatment here did n\u0027t suit you, and you had gone off to get some of your town friends to hire you.\" [109]\"Is Miss Sally tell you dat, honey? Well, ef she ain\u0027t de beatenes\u0027 w\u0027ite \u0027oman dis side er kingdom come, you kin des shoot me. Miss Sally tuck\u0027n writ me a pass wid her own han\u0027s fer ter go see some er my kin down dar in de Ashbank settlement.

The old man groaned and looked at the rafters with a curious air of disinterestedness. After a while he went on with great seriousness:— \"I dunner w\u0027at kinder idee folks got \u0027bout Brer Rabbit nohow, dat I don\u0027t. S\u0027pozen you lays de plans so some yuther chap kin git a big hunk er goody, is you gwine ter set off some\u0027r\u0027s en see \u0027im make way wid it?\" \"What kind of goody, Uncle Remus?\" \"Dish yer kinder goody w\u0027at town folks keeps. Mint draps and reezins, en sweet doin\u0027s lak Miss Sally keep und\u0027 lock en key. Well, den, if you gits some er dat, er may be some yuther kinder goody, w\u0027ich I wish \u0027t wuz yer right dis blessid minnit, is you gwine ter set quile up in dat cheer en let n\u0027er chap run off wid it? Dat you ain\u0027t—dat you ain\u0027t!\" \"Oh, I know!\" exclaimed the little boy. \"Brother Rabbit went back and made Brother Fox give him his part of the meat.\" \"Des lak I tell you, honey; dey wa\u0027n\u0027t no man \u0027mungs de creeturs w\u0027at kin stan\u0027 right flat-footed en wuk he min\u0027 quick lak Brer Rabbit. He tuck\u0027n tie de rock on de string, stidder de meat, [110]en he pursue long atter it, he did, twel Mr. Man tu\u0027n a ben\u0027 in de road, en den Brer Rabbit, he des lit out fum dar—terbuckity-buckity, buck-buck-buckity! en \u0027t wa\u0027n\u0027t long \u0027fo\u0027 he tuck\u0027n kotch up wid Brer Fox. Dey tuck de meat, dey did, en kyar\u0027d it way off in de woods, en laid it down on a clean place on de groun\u0027. \"Dey laid it down, dey did,\" continued Uncle Remus, drawing his chair up closer to the little boy, \"en den Brer Fox \u0027low dey better sample it, en Brer Rabbit he \u0027gree. Wid dat, Brer Fox he tuck\u0027n gnyaw off a hunk, en he shut bofe eyes, he did, en he chaw en chaw, en tas\u0027e en tas\u0027e, en chaw en tas\u0027e. Brer Rabbit, he watch \u0027im, but Brer Fox, he keep bofe eyes shot, en he chaw en tas\u0027e, en tas\u0027e en chaw.\" Uncle Remus not only furnished a pantomime accompaniment to this recital by shutting his eyes and pretending to taste, but he lowered his voice to a pitch of tragical significance in reporting the dialogue that ensued:— \"Den Brer Fox smack he mouf en look at de meat mo\u0027 closeter, en up\u0027n \u0027low:— \"\u0027Brer Rabbit, hit\u0027s lam\u0027!\u0027 \"\u0027No, Brer Fox! sho\u0027ly not!\u0027 \"\u0027Brer Rabbit, hit\u0027s lam\u0027!\u0027 \"\u0027Brer Fox, tooby sho\u0027ly not!\u0027 \"Den Brer Rabbit, he tuck\u0027n gnyaw off a hunk, en he shot bofe eyes, en chaw en tas\u0027e, en tas\u0027e en chaw.

Brer Fox tuck yo\u0027 meat!\u0027\" Every time Uncle Remus said \"Pow!\" he struck himself in the palm of his hand with a shoe-sole by way of illustration. \"Co\u0027se,\" he went on, \"w\u0027en Brer Fox year dis kinder doin\u0027s, he fotch up, he did, en lissen, en ev\u0027y time he year de hick\u0027ry come down pow! he tuck\u0027n grin en \u0027low ter hisse\u0027f, \u0027Ah-yi! you fool me \u0027bout de water!
