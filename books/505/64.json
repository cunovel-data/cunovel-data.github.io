HAWK AND BRER BUZZARD","content":"One night the little boy ran into Uncle Remus\u0027s cabin singing:— \"T-u Turkey, t-u Ti, T-u Turkey Buzzard\u0027s eye!\" Uncle Remus, Daddy Jack, Aunt Tempy, and \u0027Tildy were all sitting around the fire, for the Christmas weather was beginning to make itself rather severely felt. As they made room for the child, Daddy Jack flung his head back, and took up the song, beating time with his foot:— \"\u0027T-u Tukry, t-u Ti, T-u Tukry-Buzzud y-eye! T-u Tukry, t-u Ting, T-u Tukry-Buzzud wing!\" \"Deyer mighty kuse creeturs,\" said \u0027Tildy, who was sitting rather nearer to Daddy Jack than had been her custom,—a fact to which Aunt Tempy had already called the attention of Uncle Remus by a motion of her head, causing the old man to smile a smile as broad as it was wise. \"Deyer mighty kuse, an\u0027 I\u0027m fear\u0027d un um,\" \u0027Tildy went on. \"Dey looks so lonesome hit makes me have de creeps fer ter look at um.\" \"Dey no hu\u0027t-a you,\" said Daddy Jack, soothingly. \"You flut you\u0027 han\u0027 toze um dey fly \u0027way fum dey-dey.\" \"I dunno \u0027bout dat,\" said \u0027Tildy. \"Deyer bal\u0027-headed, en dat w\u0027at make me \u0027spize um.\" Daddy Jack rubbed the bald place on his head with such a comical air that even \u0027Tildy laughed. The old African retained his good-humor. \"You watch dem Buzzud,\" he said after awhile, addressing himself particularly to the little boy. \"\u0027E fly high, \u0027e fly low, \u0027e fly \u0027way \u0027roun\u0027.
