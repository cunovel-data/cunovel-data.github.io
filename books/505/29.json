The conversation took a turn that thrilled the child with mingled fear and curiosity. Uncle Remus had inquired as to the state of Aunt Tempy\u0027s health, when the latter came in, and her response was:— \"I feelin\u0027 mighty creepy, Brer Remus, sho\u0027. Look like I bleedz ter hunt comp\u0027ny. W\u0027en I come \u0027long down I felt dat skittish twel ef a leaf had blow\u0027d \u0027crost de paff, I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 des about drapt in my tracks.\" \"How come dat, Sis Tempy?\" Uncle Remus inquired. \"You know dat little gal er Riah\u0027s?

Daddy Jack roused himself. \"Oona no bin-a see dem ghos\u0027? Oona no bin-a see dem harnt? Hi!

I is bin see mo\u0027 dead ghos\u0027, but me no spot um lak dis.\" \"I boun\u0027 you is,\" said Uncle Remus. \"Dey tells me, Brer Jack,\" he continued, \"dat w\u0027en you meets up wid one er deze ha\u0027nts, ef you\u0027ll take\u0027n tu\u0027n yo\u0027 coat wrong-sud-outerds, dey won\u0027t use no time in makin\u0027 der disappearance.\" \"Hey!\" exclaimed Daddy Jack, \"tu\u0027n coat no fer skeer dead ghos\u0027. \u0027E skeer dem Jack-me-Lantun.

Enty!\" \"Dat w\u0027at make me say,\" remarked Aunt Tempy, with a little [132]shiver, \"dat \u0027oman like me, w\u0027at ain\u0027t w\u0027ar no jacket, ain\u0027t got no business traipsin\u0027 un trollopin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027 thoo the woods atter dark.\" \"You mout tu\u0027n yo\u0027 head-hankcher, Sis Tempy,\" said Uncle Remus, reassuringly, \"en ef dat ain\u0027t do no good den you kin whirl in en gin um leg-bail.\" \"I year tell,\" continued Aunt Tempy, vouchsafing no reply to Uncle Remus, \"dat dish yer Jacky-ma-Lantun is a sho\u0027 nuff sperit. Sperits ain\u0027t gwine to walk un walk less\u0027n dey got sump\u0027n\u0027 n\u0027er on der min\u0027, un I year tell dat dish yer Jacky-ma-Lantun is \u0027casioned by a man w\u0027at got kilt. Folks kilt \u0027im un tuck his money, un now his ha\u0027nt done gone un got a light fer ter hunt up whar his money is. Mighty kuse ef folks kin hone atter money w\u0027en dey done gone. I dunner w\u0027at he wanter be ramblin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027 wid a light w\u0027en he done dead. Ef anybody got any hard feelin\u0027s \u0027gin\u0027 me, I want um ter take it out w\u0027ile deyer in de flesh; w\u0027en dey come a-ha\u0027ntin\u0027 me, den I\u0027m done—I\u0027m des done.\" \"Are witches spirits?\" the little boy asked. The inquiry was not especially directed at Daddy Jack, but Daddy Jack was proud of his reputation as a witch, and he undertook to reply. \"None \u0027t all. Witch, \u0027e no dead ghos\u0027—\u0027e life folks, wey you shekky han\u0027 wit\u0027. Oona witch mebbe; how you is kin tell?\" Here Daddy Jack turned his sharp little eyes upon the child. The latter moved closer to Uncle Remus, and said he hoped to goodness he was n\u0027t a witch. \"How you is kin tell diffran \u0027cep\u0027 you bin fer try um?\" continued Daddy Jack. \"\u0027E good t\u0027ing fer be witch; \u0027e mek-a dem folks fred. \u0027E mek-a dem fred; \u0027e mek-a dem hol\u0027 da\u0027 bre\u0027t\u0027, wun dey is bin-a come by you\u0027 place.\" \"In de name er de Lord, Daddy Jack, how kin folks tell wh\u0027er dey er witches er no?\" asked Aunt Tempy. \"Oo! \u0027e easy nuff. Wun da\u0027 moon is shiün low, wet-a you\u0027 han\u0027 [133]wit\u0027 da\u0027 pot-licker grease; rub noung heifer \u0027pon \u0027e nose; git \u0027pon \u0027e bahck. Mus\u0027 hol\u0027 um by \u0027e year; mus\u0027 go gallop, gallop down da\u0027 lane, tel \u0027e do come \u0027cross one-a big gully. Mus\u0027 holler, \u0027Double, double, double up! double, double, double up!\u0027 Heifer jump, oona witch; heifer no jump, oona no witch.\" \"Did you ever ride a heifer, Daddy Jack?\" asked the little boy. \"Mo\u0027 tam es dem,\" replied the old negro, holding up the crooked fingers of one withered hand. \"Did—did she jump across the big gully?\" The child\u0027s voice had dropped to an awed whisper, and there was a glint of malicious mischief in Daddy Jack\u0027s shrewd eyes, as he looked up at Uncle Remus. He got his cue. Uncle Remus groaned heavily and shook his head. \"Hoo!\" exclaimed Daddy Jack, \"wun I is bin-a tell all, dey no mo\u0027 fer tell. Mus\u0027 kip some fer da\u0027 Sunday. Lilly b\u0027y no fred dem witch; \u0027e no bodder lilly b\u0027y. Witch, \u0027e no rassel wit\u0027 \u0027e ebry-day \u0027quaintan\u0027; \u0027e do go pars \u0027e own place.\" It was certainly reassuring for the child to be told that witches did n\u0027t trouble little boys, and that they committed their depredations outside of their own neighborhood. \"I is bin-a yeddy dem talk \u0027bout ole witch. \u0027E do leaf \u0027e skin wey \u0027e is sta\u0027t fum. Man bin-a come pars by; \u0027e is fine dem skin. \u0027E say:— \"\u0027Ki! \u0027E one green skin; I fix fer dry um.\u0027 \"Man hang um by da\u0027 fier. Skin, \u0027e do swink, i\u0027 do swivel. Bumbye \u0027e do smell-a bahd; man, \u0027e hol\u0027 \u0027e nose. \u0027E do wait. Skin swink, skin stink, skin swivel. \u0027E do git so bahd, man pitch um in da\u0027 ya\u0027d. \u0027E wait; \u0027e is wait, \u0027e is lissen. Bumbye, \u0027e yeddy da\u0027 witch come. Witch, e\u0027 do sharp\u0027 \u0027e claw on-a da\u0027 fence; \u0027e is snap \u0027e jaw—flick! flick! flick! \u0027E come-a hunt fer him skin. \u0027E fine um. \u0027E trey um on dis way; \u0027e no fit. \u0027E trey um on dat way; \u0027e no fit. \u0027E trey um on turrer way; \u0027e no fit. \u0027E pit um \u0027pon \u0027e [134]head; skin \u0027e no fit. \u0027E pit um \u0027pon \u0027e foot; skin \u0027e no fit. \u0027E cuss, \u0027e sweer; skin \u0027e no fit. \u0027E cut \u0027e caper; skin \u0027e no fit. Bumbye \u0027e holler:— \"\u0027\u0027Tiss-a me, Skin! wey you no know me? Skin, \u0027tiss-a me! wey you no know me?\u0027 \"Skin, \u0027e no talk nuttin\u0027 \u0027tall.

Man bu\u0027n da\u0027 skin; \u0027e is bin-a come bahck no mo\u0027.\" The little boy asked no more questions. He sat silent while the others talked, and then went to the door and looked out. It was very dark, and he returned to his stool with a troubled countenance. \"Des wait a little minnit, honey,\" said Uncle Remus, dropping his hand caressingly on the child\u0027s shoulder. \"I bleedz ter go up dar ter de big house fer ter see Mars John, en I\u0027ll take you \u0027long fer comp\u0027ny.\" And so, after a while, the old man and the little boy went hand in hand up the path. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2808/77609.html","bookId":505,"book":{"id":505,"title":"Nights With Uncle Remus","description":"简介： It had been raining all day so that Uncle Remus found it impossible to go out.
