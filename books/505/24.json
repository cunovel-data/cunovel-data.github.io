{"id":10682,"no":24,"title":"XXIII MR. MAN HAS SOME MEAT","content":"The little boy sat watching Uncle Remus sharpen his shoe-knife. The old man\u0027s head moved in sympathy with his hands, and he mumbled fragments of a song. Occasionally he would feel of the edge of the blade with his thumb, and then begin to sharpen it again. The comical appearance of the venerable darkey finally had its effect upon the child, for suddenly he broke into a hearty peal of laughter; whereupon Uncle Remus stopped shaking his head and singing his mumbly-song, and assumed a very dignified attitude. Then he drew a long, deep breath, and said:— \"\u0027Wen folks git ole en stricken wid de palsy, dey mus\u0027 \u0027speck ter be laff\u0027d at. Goodness knows, I bin use ter dat sence de day my whiskers \u0027gun to bleach.\" \"Why, I was n\u0027t laughing at you, Uncle Remus; I declare I was n\u0027t,\" cried the little boy. \"I thought maybe you might be doing your head like Brother Rabbit did when he was fixing to cut his meat.\" Uncle Remus\u0027s seriousness was immediately driven away by a broad and appreciative grin. \"Now, dat de way ter talk, honey, en I boun\u0027 you wa\u0027n\u0027t fur wrong, n\u0027er, \u0027kaze fer all dey\u0027ll tell you dat Brer Rabbit make he livin\u0027 \u0027long er nibblin\u0027 at grass en greens, hit \u0027t wa\u0027n\u0027t dat a-way [106]in dem days, \u0027kaze I got in my \u0027membunce right now de \u0027casion whar Brer Rabbit is tuck\u0027n e\u0027t meat.\" The little boy had learned that it was not best to make any display of impatience, and so he waited quietly while Uncle Remus busied himself with arranging the tools on his shoe-bench. Presently the old man began:— \"Hit so happen dat one day Brer Rabbit meet up wid Brer Fox, en w\u0027en dey \u0027quire atter der corporosity, dey fine out dat bofe un um mighty po\u0027ly. Brer Fox, he \u0027low, he do, dat he monst\u0027us hongry, en Brer Rabbit he \u0027spon\u0027 dat he got a mighty hankerin\u0027 atter vittles hisse\u0027f. Bimeby dey look up de big road, en dey see Mr. Man comin\u0027 \u0027long wid a great big hunk er beef und\u0027 he arm. Brer Fox he up \u0027n \u0027low, he did, dat he lak mighty well fer ter git a tas\u0027e er dat, en Brer Rabbit he \u0027low dat de sight er dat nice meat all lineded wid taller is nuff fer ter run a body \u0027stracted. \"Mr. Man he come en he come \u0027long. Brer Rabbit en Brer Fox dey look en dey look at \u0027im. Dey wink der eye en der mouf water. Brer Rabbit he \u0027low he bleedz ter git some er dat meat. Brer Fox he \u0027spon\u0027, he did, dat it look mighty fur off ter him. Den Brer Rabbit tell Brer Fox fer ter foller \u0027long atter \u0027im in hailin\u0027 distuns, en wid dat he put out, he did, en \u0027t wa\u0027nt long \u0027fo\u0027 he kotch up wid Mr. Man. \"Dey pass de time er day, en den dey went joggin\u0027 \u0027long de road same lak dey \u0027uz gwine \u0027pun a journey. Brer Rabbit he keep on snuffin\u0027 de a\u0027r. Mr. Man up\u0027n ax \u0027im is he got a bad cole, en Brer Rabbit \u0027spon\u0027 dat he smell sump\u0027n\u0027 w\u0027ich it don\u0027t smell like ripe peaches. Bimeby, Brer Rabbit \u0027gun to hoi\u0027 he nose, he did, en atter w\u0027ile he sing out:— \"\u0027Gracious en de goodness, Mr. Man! hit\u0027s dat meat er yone. Phew! Whar\u0027bouts is you pick up dat meat at?\u0027 \"Dis make Mr. Man feel sorter \u0027shame\u0027 hisse\u0027f, en ter make marters wuss, yer come a great big green fly a-zoonin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027. Brer Rabbit he git way off on t\u0027er side er de road, en he keep on [107]hol\u0027in\u0027 he nose. Mr. Man, he look sorter sheepish, he did, en dey ain\u0027t gone fur \u0027fo\u0027 he put de meat down on de side er de road, en he tuck\u0027n ax Brer Rabbit w\u0027at dey gwine do \u0027bout it. Brer Rabbit he \u0027low, he did:— \"\u0027I year tell in my time dat ef you take\u0027n drag a piece er meat thoo\u0027 de dus\u0027 hit\u0027ll fetch back hits freshness. I ain\u0027t no superspicious man myse\u0027f,\u0027 sezee, \u0027en I ain\u0027t got no \u0027speunce wid no sech doin\u0027s, but dem w\u0027at tell me say dey done try it. Yit I knows dis,\u0027 says Brer Rabbit, sezee,—\u0027I knows dat \u0027t ain\u0027t gwine do no harm, \u0027kaze de grit w\u0027at gits on de meat kin be wash off,\u0027 sez Brer Rabbit, sezee. \"\u0027I ain\u0027t got no string,\u0027 sez Mr. Man, sezee. \"Brer Rabbit laff hearty, but still he hol\u0027 he nose. \"\u0027Time you bin in de bushes long ez I is, you won\u0027t miss strings,\u0027 sez Brer Rabbit, sezee. \"Wid dat Brer Rabbit lipt out, en he ain\u0027t gone long \u0027fo\u0027 he come hoppin\u0027 back wid a whole passel er bamboo vines all tied tergedder. Mr. Man, he \u0027low:— \"\u0027Dat line mighty long.\u0027 \"Brer Rabbit he \u0027low:— \"\u0027Tooby sho\u0027, you want de win\u0027 fer ter git \u0027twix\u0027 you en dat meat.\u0027 \"Den Mr. Man tuck\u0027n tied de bamboo line ter de meat. Brer Rabbit he broke off a \u0027simmon bush, he did, en \u0027low dat he\u0027d stay behime en keep de flies off. Mr. Man he go on befo\u0027 en drag de meat, en Brer Rabbit he stay behime, he did, en take keer un it.\" Here Uncle Remus was compelled to pause and laugh before he could proceed with the story. \"En he is take keer un it, mon—dat he is. He tuck\u0027n git \u0027im a rock, en w\u0027iles Mr. Man gwine \u0027long bidout lookin\u0027 back, he ondo de meat en tie de rock ter de bamboo line, en w\u0027en Brer Fox foller on, sho\u0027 nuff, dar lay de meat.

En so dat de way Brer Rabbit git Mr. Man meat.\" The little boy reflected a little, and then said:— \"Uncle Remus, was n\u0027t that stealing?\" \"Well, I tell you \u0027bout dat, honey,\" responded the old man, with the air of one who is willing to compromise. \"In dem days de creeturs bleedz ter look out fer deyse\u0027f, mo\u0027 speshually dem w\u0027at ain\u0027t got hawn en huff. Brer Rabbit ain\u0027t got no hawn en huff, en he bleedz ter be he own lawyer.\" Just then the little boy heard his father\u0027s buggy rattling down the avenue, and he ran out into the darkness to meet it. After he was gone, Uncle Remus sat a long time rubbing his hands and looking serious. Finally he leaned back in his chair, and exclaimed:— \"Dat little chap gittin\u0027 too much fer ole Remus—dat he is!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2808/77604.html","bookId":505,"book":{"id":505,"title":"Nights With Uncle Remus","description":"简介： It had been raining all day so that Uncle Remus found it impossible to go out.
