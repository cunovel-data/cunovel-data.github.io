{"id":10684,"no":26,"title":"XXV AFRICAN JACK","content":"Usually, the little boy, who regarded himself as Uncle Remus\u0027s partner, was not at all pleased when he found the old man entertaining, in his simple way, any of his colored friends; but he was secretly delighted when he called one night and found Daddy Jack sitting by Uncle Remus\u0027s hearth. Daddy Jack was an object of curiosity to older people than the little boy. He was a genuine African, and for that reason he was known as African Jack, though the child had been taught to call him Daddy Jack. He was brought to Georgia in a slave-ship when he was about twenty years old, and remained upon one of the sea-islands for several years. Finally, he fell into the hands of the family of which Uncle Remus\u0027s little partner was the youngest representative, and became the trusted foreman of a plantation, in the southern part of Georgia, known as the Walthall Place. Once every year he was in the habit of visiting the Home Place in Middle Georgia, and it was during one of these annual visits that the little boy found him in Uncle Remus\u0027s cabin. Daddy Jack appeared to be quite a hundred years old, but he was probably not more than eighty. He was a little, dried-up old man, whose weazened, dwarfish appearance, while it was calculated to inspire awe in the minds of the superstitious, was not without its pathetic suggestions. The child had been told that the old African was a wizard, a conjurer, and a snake-charmer; but he was not afraid, for, in any event,—conjuration, witchcraft, or what not,—he was assured of the protection of Uncle Remus. [113]As the little boy entered the cabin Uncle Remus smiled and nodded pleasantly, and made a place for him on a little stool upon which had been piled the odds and ends of work. Daddy Jack paid no attention to the child; his thoughts seemed to be elsewhere. \"Go en shake han\u0027s, honey, en tell Daddy Jack howdy. He lak good chilluns.\" Then to Daddy Jack: \"Brer Jack, dish yer de chap w\u0027at I bin tellin\u0027 you \u0027bout.\" The little boy did as he was bid, but Daddy Jack grunted ungraciously and made no response to the salutation. He was evidently not fond of children. Uncle Remus glanced curiously at the dwarfed and withered figure, and spoke a little more emphatically:— \"Brer Jack, ef you take good look at dis chap, I lay you\u0027ll see mo\u0027n you speck ter see. You\u0027ll see sump\u0027n\u0027 dat\u0027ll make you grunt wusser dan you grunted deze many long year. Go up dar, honey, whar Daddy Jack kin see you.\" The child went shyly up to the old African and stood at his knee. The sorrows and perplexities of nearly a hundred years lay between them; and now, as always, the baffled eyes of age gazed into the Sphinx-like face of youth, as if by this means to unravel the mysteries of the past and solve the problems of the future. Daddy Jack took the plump, rosy hands of the little boy in his black, withered ones, and gazed into his face so long and steadily, and with such curious earnestness, that the child did n\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry. Presently the old African flung his hands to his head, and rocked his body from side to side, moaning and mumbling, and talking to himself, while the tears ran down his face like rain. \"Ole Missy! Ole Missy! \u0027E come back! I bin shum dey-dey, I bin shum de night! I bin yeddy \u0027e v\u0027ice, I bin yeddy de sign!\" \"Ah-yi!\" exclaimed Uncle Remus, into whose arms the little boy had fled; \"I des know\u0027d dat \u0027ud fetch \u0027im. Hit\u0027s bin manys [114]de long days sence Brer Jack seed Ole Miss, yit ef he ain\u0027t seed \u0027er dat whack, den I ain\u0027t settin\u0027 yer.\" After a while Daddy Jack ceased his rocking, and his moaning, and his crying, and sat gazing wistfully into the fireplace. Whatever he saw there fixed his attention, for Uncle Remus spoke to him several times without receiving a response. Presently, however, Daddy Jack exclaimed with characteristic but laughable irrelevance:— \"I no lakky dem gal wut is bin-a stan\u0027 pidjin-toe. Wun \u0027e fetch pail er water on \u0027e head, water churray, churray. I no lakky dem gal wut tie \u0027e wool up wit\u0027 string; mekky him stan\u0027 ugly fer true. I bin ahx da\u0027 \u0027Tildy gal fer marry me, un \u0027e no crack \u0027im bre\u0027t\u0027 fer mek answer \u0027cep\u0027 \u0027e bre\u0027k out un lahf by me werry face. Da\u0027 gal do holler un lahf un stomp \u0027e fut dey-dey, un dun I shum done gone pidjin-toe. Oona bin know da\u0027 \u0027Tildy gal?\" \"I bin a-knowin\u0027 dat gal,\" said Uncle Remus, grimly regarding the old African; \"I bin a-knowin\u0027 dat gal now gwine on sence she \u0027uz knee-high ter one er deze yer puddle-ducks; en I bin noticin\u0027 lately dat she mighty likely nigger.\" \"Enty!\" exclaimed Daddy Jack, enthusiastically, \"I did bin mek up ter da\u0027 lilly gal troo t\u0027ick un t\u0027in. I bin fetch \u0027im one fine \u0027possum, un mo\u0027 ez one, two, free peck-a taty, un bumbye I bin fetch \u0027im one bag pop-co\u0027n. Wun I bin do dat, I is fley \u0027roun\u0027 da\u0027 lilly gal so long tam, un I yeddy \u0027im talk wit\u0027 turrer gal. \u0027E do say: \u0027Daddy Jack fine ole man fer true.\u0027 Dun I is bin talk: \u0027Oona no call-a me Daddy Jack wun dem preacher man come fer marry we.\u0027 Dun da\u0027 lilly gal t\u0027row \u0027e head back; \u0027e squeal lak filly in canebrake.\" The little boy understood this rapidly spoken lingo perfectly well, but he would have laughed anyhow, for there was more than a suggestion of the comic in the shrewd seriousness that seemed to focus itself in Daddy Jack\u0027s pinched and wrinkled face. \"She tuck de truck w\u0027at you tuck\u0027n fotch \u0027er,\" said Uncle [115]Remus, with the air of one carefully and deliberately laying the basis of a judicial opinion, \"en den w\u0027en you sail in en talk bizness, den she up en gun you de flat un \u0027er foot en de back un \u0027er han\u0027, en den, atter dat, she tuck\u0027n laff en make spote un you.\" \"Enty!\" assented Daddy Jack, admiringly. \"Well, den, Brer Jack, youer mighty ole, en yit hit seem lak youer mighty young; kaze a man w\u0027at ain\u0027t got no mo\u0027 speunce wid wimmen folks dan w\u0027at you is neenter creep \u0027roun\u0027 yer callin\u0027 deyse\u0027f ole. Dem kinder folks ain\u0027t ole nuff, let \u0027lone bein\u0027 too ole. W\u0027en de gal tuck\u0027n laff, Brer Jack, w\u0027at \u0027uz yo\u0027 nex\u0027 move?\" demanded Uncle Remus, looking down upon the shrivelled old man with an air of superiority. Daddy Jack shut his shrewd little eyes tightly and held them so, as if by that means to recall all the details of the flirtation. Then he said:— \"Da\u0027 lilly gal is bin tek dem t\u0027ing. \u0027E is bin say, \u0027T\u0027anky, t\u0027anky.\u0027 Him eaty da\u0027 \u0027possum, him eaty da\u0027 pop-co\u0027n, him roas\u0027n da\u0027 taty. \u0027E do say, \u0027T\u0027anky, t\u0027anky!\u0027 Wun I talk marry, \u0027e is bin ris \u0027e v\u0027ice un squeal lak lilly pig stuck in \u0027e t\u0027roat. \u0027E do holler: \u0027Hi, Daddy Jack! wut is noung gal gwan do wit\u0027 so ole man lak dis?\u0027 Un I is bin say: \u0027Wut noung gal gwan do wit\u0027 ole Chris\u0027mus\u0027 cep\u0027 \u0027e do \u0027joy \u0027ese\u0027f?\u0027 Un da\u0027 lil gal \u0027e do lahff un flut \u0027ese\u0027f way fum dey-dey.\" \"I know\u0027d a nigger one time,\" said Uncle Remus, after pondering a moment, \"w\u0027at tuck a notion dat he want a bait er \u0027simmons, en de mo\u0027 w\u0027at de notion tuck \u0027im de mo\u0027 w\u0027at he want um, en bimeby, hit look lak he des nat\u0027ally erbleedz ter have um. He want de \u0027simmons, en dar dey is in de tree. He mouf water, en dar hang de \u0027simmons. Now, den, w\u0027at do dat nigger do? W\u0027en you en me en dish yer chile yer wants \u0027simmons, we goes out en shakes de tree, en ef deyer good en ripe, down dey comes, en ef deyer good en green, dar dey stays. But dish yer yuther nigger, [116]he too smart fer dat. He des tuck\u0027n tuck he stan\u0027 und\u0027 de tree, en he open he mouf, he did, en wait fer de \u0027simmons fer ter drap in dar. Dey ain\u0027t none drap in yit,\" continued Uncle Remus, gently knocking the cold ashes out of his pipe; \"en w\u0027at\u0027s mo\u0027, dey ain\u0027t none gwine ter drap in dar. Dat des \u0027zackly de way wid Brer Jack yer, \u0027bout marryin\u0027; he stan\u0027 dar, he do, en he hol\u0027 bofe han\u0027s wide open en he \u0027speck de gal gwine ter drap right spang in um. Man want gal, he des got ter grab \u0027er—dat\u0027s w\u0027at. Dey may squall en dey may flutter, but flutter\u0027n\u0027 en squallin\u0027 ain\u0027t done no damage yit ez I knows un, en \u0027t ain\u0027t gwine ter. Young chaps kin make great \u0027miration \u0027bout gals, but w\u0027en dey gits ole ez I is, dey ull know dat folks is folks, en w\u0027en it come ter bein\u0027 folks, de wimmen ain gut none de \u0027vantage er de men. Now dat\u0027s des de plain up en down tale I\u0027m a-tellin\u0027 un you.\" This deliverance from so respectable an authority seemed to please Daddy Jack immensely. He rubbed his withered hands together, smacked his lips and chuckled. After a few restless movements he got up and went shuffling to the door, his quick, short steps causing Uncle Remus to remark:— \"De gal w\u0027at git ole Brer Jack \u0027ull git a natchul pacer, sho\u0027. He move mo\u0027 one-sideder dan ole Zip Coon, w\u0027ich he rack up de branch all night long wid he nose p\u0027int lak he gwine \u0027cross.\" While the little boy was endeavoring to get Uncle Remus to explain the nature of Daddy Jack\u0027s grievances, muffled laughter was heard outside, and almost immediately \u0027Tildy rushed in the door. \u0027Tildy flung herself upon the floor and rolled and laughed until, apparently, she could laugh no more. Then she seemed to grow severely angry. She arose from the floor and flopped herself down in a chair, and glared at Uncle Remus with indignation in her eyes. As soon as she could control her inflamed feelings, she cried:— \"Wat is I done ter you, Unk\u0027 Remus? \u0027Fo\u0027 de Lord, ef anybody wuz ter come en tole me dat you gwine ter put de Ole Boy [117]in dat ole Affikin nigger head, I would n\u0027t er b\u0027leeved um—dat I would n\u0027t. Unk\u0027 Remus, w\u0027at is I done ter you?\" Uncle Remus made no direct response; but he leaned over, reached out his hand, and picked up an unfinished axe-helve that stood in the corner. Then he took the little boy by the arm, and pushed him out of the way, saying in his gentlest and most persuasive tone:— \"Stan\u0027 sorter \u0027roun\u0027 dar, honey, \u0027kaze w\u0027en de splinters \u0027gin ter fly, I want you ter be out\u0027n de way. Miss Sally never gimme \u0027er fergivance in de roun\u0027 worl\u0027 ef you \u0027uz ter git hurted on account er de frazzlin\u0027 er dish yer piece er timber.\" Uncle Remus\u0027s movements and remarks had a wonderful effect on \u0027Tildy. Her anger disappeared, her eyes lost their malignant expression, and her voice fell to a conversational tone. \"Now, Unk\u0027 Remus, you ought n\u0027t ter do me dat a-way, \u0027kaze I ain\u0027t done nothin\u0027 ter you. I \u0027uz settin\u0027 up yon\u0027 in Aunt Tempy house, des now, runnin\u0027 on wid Riah, en yer come dat ole Affikin Jack en say you say he kin marry me ef he ketch me, en he try ter put he arm \u0027roun\u0027 me en kiss me.\" \u0027Tildy tossed her head and puckered her mouth at the bare remembrance of it. \"W\u0027at wud did you gin Brer Jack?\" inquired Uncle Remus, not without asperity. \"W\u0027at I gwine tell him?\" exclaimed \u0027Tildy disdainfully. \"I des tuck\u0027n up en tole \u0027im he foolin\u0027 wid de wrong nigger.\" \u0027Tildy would have continued her narration, but just at that moment the shuffling of feet was heard outside, and Daddy Jack came in, puffing and blowing and smiling. Evidently he had been hunting for \u0027Tildy in every house in the negro quarter. \"Hi!\" he exclaimed, \"lil gal, \u0027e bin skeet sem lak ma\u0027sh hen. \u0027E no run no mo\u0027.\" [118]\"Pick \u0027er up, Brer Jack,\" exclaimed Uncle Remus; \"she\u0027s yone.\" \u0027Tildy was angry as well as frightened. She would have fled, but Daddy Jack stood near the door. \"Look yer, nigger man!\" she exclaimed, \"ef you come slobbun \u0027roun\u0027 me, I\u0027ll take one er deze yer dog-iüns en brain you wid it. I ain\u0027t gwine ter have no web-foot nigger follerin\u0027 atter me. Now you des come!—I ain\u0027t feard er yo\u0027 cunjun. Unk\u0027 Remus, ef you got any intruss in dat ole Affikin ape, you better make \u0027im lemme \u0027lone. G\u0027way fum yer now!\" All this time Daddy Jack was slowly approaching \u0027Tildy, bowing and smiling, and looking quite dandified, as Uncle Remus afterward said. Just as the old African was about to lay hands upon \u0027Tildy, she made a rush for the door. The movement was so unexpected that Daddy Jack was upset. He fell upon Uncle Remus\u0027s shoe-bench, and then rolled off on the floor, where he lay clutching at the air, and talking so rapidly that nobody could understand a word he said. Uncle Remus lifted him to his feet, with much dignity, and it soon became apparent that he was neither hurt nor angry. The little boy laughed immoderately, and he was still laughing when \u0027Tildy put her head in the door and exclaimed:— \"Unk\u0027 Remus, I ain\u0027t kilt dat ole nigger, is I? \u0027Kaze ef I got ter go ter de gallus, I want to go dar fer sump\u0027n\u0027 n\u0027er bigger\u0027n dat.\" Uncle Remus disdained to make any reply, but Daddy Jack chuckled and patted himself on the knee as he cried:— \"Come \u0027long, lilly gal! come \u0027long! I no mad. I fall down dey fer laff. Come \u0027long, lilly gal, come \u0027long.\" \u0027Tildy went on laughing loudly and talking to herself. After awhile Uncle Remus said:— \"Honey, I \u0027speck Miss Sally lookin\u0027 und\u0027 de bed en axin\u0027 whar you is. You better leak out fum yer now, en by dis time ter[119]morrer night I\u0027ll git Brer Jack all primed up, en he\u0027ll whirl in en tell you a tale.\" Daddy Jack nodded assent, and the little boy ran laughing to the \"big house.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2808/77606.html","bookId":505,"book":{"id":505,"title":"Nights With Uncle Remus","description":"简介： It had been raining all day so that Uncle Remus found it impossible to go out.
