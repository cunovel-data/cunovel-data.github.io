{"id":10729,"no":71,"title":"LXXI THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS","content":"The day and the night before Christmas were full of pleasure for the little boy. There was pleasure in the big house, and pleasure in the humble cabins in the quarters. The peculiar manner in which the negroes celebrated the beginning of the holidays was familiar to the child\u0027s experience, but strange to his appreciation, and he enjoyed everything he saw and heard with the ready delight of his years,—a delight, which, in this instance, had been trained and sharpened, if the expression may be used, in the small world over which Uncle Remus presided. The little boy had a special invitation to be present at the marriage of Daddy Jack and \u0027Tildy, and he went, accompanied by Uncle Remus and Aunt Tempy. It seemed to be a very curious affair, but its incongruities made small impression upon the mind of the child. \u0027Tildy wore a white dress and had a wreath of artificial flowers in her hair. Daddy Jack wore a high hat, which he persisted in keeping on his head during the ceremony, and a coat the tails of which nearly dragged the floor. His bright little eyes glistened triumphantly, and he grinned and bowed to everybody again and again. After it was all over, the guests partook of cake baked by Aunt Tempy, and persimmon beer brewed by Uncle Remus. It seemed, however, that \u0027Tildy was not perfectly happy; for, in response to a question asked by Aunt Tempy, she said:— \"Yes\u0027m, I\u0027m gwine down de country \u0027long wid my ole man, an\u0027 I lay ef eve\u0027ything don\u0027t go right, I\u0027m gwineter pick up en come right back.\" [334]\"No-no!\" exclaimed Daddy Jack, \"\u0027e no come bahck no\u0027n \u0027t all. \u0027E bin stay dey-dey wit\u0027 \u0027e nice ole-a màn.\" \"You put yo\u0027 pennunce in dat!\" said \u0027Tildy, scornfully. \"Dey ain\u0027t nobody kin hol\u0027 me w\u0027en I takes a notion, \u0027cep\u0027n hit\u0027s Miss Sally; en, goodness knows, Miss Sally ain\u0027t gwine ter be down dar.\" \"Who Miss Sally gwine put in de house?\" Aunt Tempy asked. \"Humph!\" exclaimed \u0027Tildy, scornfully, \"Miss Sally say she gwine take dat ar Darkess[87] nigger en put \u0027er in my place. En a mighty nice mess Darkess gwine ter make un it! Much she know \u0027bout waitin\u0027 on w\u0027ite folks! Many\u0027s en many\u0027s de time Miss Sally\u0027ll set down in \u0027er rockin\u0027-cheer en wish fer \u0027Tildy—many\u0027s de time.\" This was \u0027Tildy\u0027s grievance,—the idea that some one could be found to fill her place; and it is a grievance with which people of greater importance than the humble negro house-girl are more or less familiar. But the preparations for the holidays went on in spite of \u0027Tildy\u0027s grievance. A large platform, used for sunning wheat and seed cotton, was arranged by the negroes for their dance, and several wagon-loads of resinous pine—known as lightwood—were placed around about it in little heaps, so that the occasion might lack no element of brilliancy. At nightfall the heaps of lightwood were set on fire, and the little boy, who was waiting impatiently for Uncle Remus to come for him, could hear the negroes singing, dancing, and laughing. He was just ready to cry when he heard the voice of his venerable partner. \"Is dey a\u0027er passenger anywhar\u0027s \u0027roun\u0027 yer fer Thumptown? De stage done ready en de hosses a-prancin\u0027. Ef dey\u0027s a\u0027er passenger \u0027roun\u0027 yer, I lay he des better be makin\u0027 ready fer ter go.\" The old man walked up to the back piazza as he spoke, held out his strong arms, and the little boy jumped into them with an [335]exclamation of delight. The child\u0027s mother gave Uncle Remus a shawl to wrap around the child, and this shawl was the cause of considerable trouble, for the youngster persisted in wrapping it around the old man\u0027s head, and so blinding him that there was danger of his falling. Finally, he put the little boy down, took off his hat, raised his right hand, and said:— \"Now, den, I bin a-beggin\u0027 un you fer ter quit yo\u0027 \u0027haveishness des long ez I\u0027m a-gwinter, en I ain\u0027t gwine beg you no mo\u0027, \u0027kaze I\u0027m des teetotally wo\u0027 out wid beggin\u0027, en de mo\u0027 I begs de wuss you gits. Now I\u0027m done! You des go yo\u0027 ways en I\u0027ll go mine, en my way lays right spang back ter de big house whar Miss Sally is. Dat\u0027s whar I\u0027m a-gwine!\" Uncle Remus started to the house with an exaggerated vigor of movement comical to behold; but, however comical it may have been, it had its effect. The little boy ran after him, caught him by the hand, and made him stop. \"Now, Uncle Remus, please don\u0027t go back. I was just playing.\" Uncle Remus\u0027s anger was all pretence, but he managed to make it very impressive. \"My playin\u0027 days done gone too long ter talk \u0027bout. When I plays, I plays wid wuk, dat w\u0027at I plays wid.\" \"Well,\" said the child, who had tactics of his own, \"if I can\u0027t play with you, I don\u0027t know who I am to play with.\" This touched Uncle Remus in a very tender spot. He stopped in the path, took off his spectacles, wiped the glasses on his coat-tail, and said very emphatically:— \"Now den, honey, des lissen at me. How de name er goodness kin you call dat playin\u0027, w\u0027ich er little mo\u0027 en I\u0027d er fell down on top er my head, en broke my neck en yone too?\" The child promised that he would be very good, and Uncle Remus picked him up, and the two made their way to where the negroes had congregated. They were greeted with cries of \"Dar\u0027s Unk Remus!\" \"Howdy, Unk Remus!\" \"Yer dey is!\" \"Ole man [336]Remus don\u0027t sing; but w\u0027en he do sing—gentermens! des go \u0027way!\" All this and much more, so that when Uncle Remus had placed the little boy upon a corner of the platform, and made him comfortable, he straightened himself with a laugh and cried out:— \"Howdy, boys! howdy all! I des come up fer ter jine in wid you fer one \u0027roun\u0027 fer de sakes er ole times, ef no mo\u0027.\" \"I boun\u0027 fer Unk Remus!\" some one said. \"Now des hush en let Unk Remus \u0027lone!\" exclaimed another. The figure of the old man, as he stood smiling upon the crowd of negroes, was picturesque in the extreme. He seemed to be taller than all the rest; and, notwithstanding his venerable appearance, he moved and spoke with all the vigor of youth. He had always exercised authority over his fellow-servants. He had been the captain of the corn-pile, the stoutest at the log-rolling, the swiftest with the hoe, the neatest with the plough, and the plantation hands still looked upon him as their leader. Some negro from the River place had brought a fiddle, and, though it was a very feeble one, its screeching seemed to annoy Uncle Remus. \"Put up dat ar fiddle!\" he exclaimed, waving his hand. \"Des put \u0027er up; she sets my toof on aidje. Put \u0027er up en les go back ter ole times. Dey ain\u0027t no room fer no fiddle \u0027roun\u0027 yer, \u0027kaze w\u0027en you gits me started dat ar fiddle won\u0027t be nowhars.\" \"Dat\u0027s so,\" said the man with the fiddle, and the irritating instrument was laid aside. \"Now, den,\" Uncle Remus went on, \"dey\u0027s a little chap yer dat you\u0027ll all come ter know mighty well one er deze odd-come-shorts, en dish yer little chap ain\u0027t got so mighty long fer ter set up \u0027long wid us. Dat bein\u0027 de case we oughter take \u0027n put de bes\u0027 foot fo\u0027mus\u0027 fer ter commence wid.\" \"You lead, Unk Remus! You des lead en we\u0027ll foller.\" Thereupon the old man called to the best singers among the [337]negroes and made them stand near him. Then he raised his right hand to his ear and stood perfectly still. The little boy thought he was listening for something, but presently Uncle Remus began to slap himself gently with his left hand, first upon the leg and then upon the breast. The other negroes kept time to this by a gentle motion of their feet, and finally, when the thump—thump—thump of this movement had regulated itself to suit the old man\u0027s fancy, he broke out with what may be called a Christmas dance song. His voice was strong, and powerful, and sweet, and its range was as astonishing as its volume. More than this, the melody to which he tuned it, and which was caught up by a hundred voices almost as sweet and as powerful as his own, was charged with a mysterious and pathetic tenderness. The fine company of men and women at the big house—men and women who had made the tour of all the capitals of Europe—listened with swelling hearts and with tears in their eyes as the song rose and fell upon the air—at one moment a tempest of melody, at another a heart-breaking strain breathed softly and sweetly to the gentle winds. The song that the little boy and the fine company heard was something like this—ridiculous enough when put in cold type, but powerful and thrilling when joined to the melody with which the negroes had invested it:— MY HONEY, MY LOVE Hit\u0027s a mighty fur ways up de Far\u0027well Lane, My honey, my love! You may ax Mister Crow, you may ax Mr. Crane, My honey, my love! Dey\u0027ll make you a bow, en dey\u0027ll tell you de same, My honey, my love! Hit\u0027s a mighty fur ways fer to go in de night, My honey, my love! My honey, my love, my heart\u0027s delight— My honey, my love!

My honey, my love, my heart\u0027s delight— My honey, my love! After a while the song was done, and other songs were sung; but it was not long before Uncle Remus discovered that the little boy was fast asleep. The old man took the child in his arms and carried him to the big house, singing softly in his ear all the way; and somehow or other the song seemed to melt and mingle in the youngster\u0027s dreams. He thought he was floating in the air, while somewhere near all the negroes were singing, Uncle Remus\u0027s voice above all the rest; and then, after he had found a resting-place upon a soft warm bank of clouds, he thought he heard the songs renewed. They grew fainter and fainter in his dreams until at last (it seemed) Uncle Remus leaned over him and sang \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2808/77651.html","bookId":505,"book":{"id":505,"title":"Nights With Uncle Remus","description":"简介： It had been raining all day so that Uncle Remus found it impossible to go out.
