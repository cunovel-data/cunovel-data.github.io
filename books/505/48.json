Uncle Remus, who was delightfully human in his hypocrisy, as well as in other directions, leaned back in his chair, looked at the little boy with an air of grieved resignation, and said:— \"I boun\u0027 you does, honey, I boun\u0027 you does. Ole Brer Jack look mighty weazly ter de naked eye, but I lay he\u0027s a lots mo\u0027 likelier nigger dan w\u0027at ole Remus is. De time done gone by w\u0027en a po\u0027 ole no-\u0027count nigger lak me kin hol\u0027 he han\u0027 wid a bran new nigger man lak Brer Jack.\" The child stared at Uncle Remus with open-eyed astonishment. \"Now, Uncle Remus! I did n\u0027t mean that; you know I did n\u0027t,\" he exclaimed. \"Bless yo\u0027 heart, honey! hit don\u0027t pester me. I done got de speunce un it. Dat I is. Plough-hoss don\u0027t squeal en kick w\u0027en dey puts \u0027n\u0027er hoss in he place. Brer Jack got de age on \u0027im but he new ter you.

Sho\u0027ly I ain\u0027t pas\u0027 doin\u0027 dat.\" The child was troubled to think that Uncle Remus should find it necessary to depreciate himself, and he made haste to explain his position. \"I thought that if Daddy Jack was here he could tell me a story while you are working, so you would n\u0027t be bothered.\" A broad grin of appreciation spread over Uncle Remus\u0027s face. [235]He adjusted his spectacles, looked around and behind him, and then, seeing no one but the child, addressed himself to the rafters and cobwebs:— \"Well! well! well! ef dish yer don\u0027t beat all! Gentermens! dish yer little chap yer, he puny in de legs, yit he mighty strong in de head.\" He paused, as if reflecting over the whole matter, and then turned to the child:— \"Is dat w\u0027at make you hone atter Daddy Jack, honey—des \u0027kaze you wanter set back dar en lissen at a tale? Now, den, ef you had n\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 got me off\u0027n de track, you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 bin settin\u0027 yer lis\u0027nen at one un um dis blessid minnit, \u0027kaze des time I year talk dat Mars John gwine ter have dat ar long-hornded steer kilt fer beef, hit come \u0027cross my min\u0027 \u0027bout de time w\u0027ence Brer Rabbit en Brer Fox j\u0027ined in wid one er \u0027n\u0027er en kilt a cow.\" \"Killed a cow, Uncle Remus?\" \"Des ez sho\u0027 ez youer settin\u0027 dar,\" replied the old man with emphasis. \"Look lak dey wa\u0027n\u0027t no kinder doin\u0027s w\u0027at dem ar creeturs wa\u0027n\u0027t up ter, mo\u0027 speshually ole Brer Rabbit. Day in en day out, fum mawnin\u0027 twel night en fum night twel mawnin\u0027, he \u0027uz constant a-studyin\u0027 up some bran new kinder contrapshun fer ter let de yuther creeturs know he \u0027uz some\u0027rs in de neighborhoods. \"Come down ter dat, you kin b\u0027leeve me er not b\u0027leeve me, des ez you er min\u0027 ter; you kin take yo\u0027 choosement; but ole Brer Rabbit en ole Brer Fox, spite er dey fallin\u0027 out, dey tuck\u0027n go inter cahoots en kilt a cow. Seem lak I disremember who de cow b\u0027long ter,\" continued the old man, frowning thoughtfully, and thus, by a single stroke, imparting an air of reality to the story; \"but she sho\u0027ly b\u0027long\u0027d ter some er de neighbors, \u0027kaze you kin des put it down, right pine-blank, dat Brer Rabbit ain\u0027t gwine ter kill he own cow, en needer is Brer Fox. \"Well, den, dey tuck\u0027n kilt a cow, en \u0027t wa\u0027n\u0027t dey own cow, [236]en alter dey done skunt \u0027er Brer Rabbit, he up\u0027n \u0027low, he did, dat ef Brer Fox wanter git de good er de game, he better run home en fetch a tray er sump\u0027n fer put de jiblets in.\" \"Jiblets, Uncle Remus?\" \"Tooby sho\u0027, honey. Dats w\u0027at we-all calls de liver, de lights, de heart, en de melt. Some calls um jiblets en some calls um hasletts, but ef you\u0027ll lemme take um en kyar um home, you kin des up en call um mos\u0027 by any name w\u0027at creep inter yo\u0027 min\u0027. You do de namin\u0027,\" the old man went on, smacking his lips suggestively, \"en I\u0027ll do de eatin\u0027, en ef I\u0027m de loser, I boun\u0027 you won\u0027t year no complaints fum me. \"But, law bless me! w\u0027at is I\u0027m a-doin\u0027? De time\u0027s a-passin\u0027, en I\u0027m ain\u0027t skacely got start on de tale. Dey kilt de cow, dey did, en Brer Rabbit tell Brer Fox \u0027bout de jiblets, en w\u0027iles Brer Fox gwine on home atter de bucket fer ter put um in, he say ter hisse\u0027f dat Brer Rabbit ain\u0027t bad ez he crackt up ter be. But no sooner is Brer Fox outer sight dan Brer Rabbit cut out de jiblets, he did, en kyar\u0027d um off en hide um. Den he come back en tuck a piece er de meat en drap blood \u0027way off de udder way. \"Bimeby yer come Brer Fox wid he bucket, en w\u0027en he git dar Brer Rabbit wuz settin\u0027 down cryin\u0027.
