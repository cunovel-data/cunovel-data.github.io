{"id":10670,"no":12,"title":"XI HOW MR. ROOSTER LOST HIS DINNER","content":"It seemed that the rainy season had set in in earnest, but the little boy went down to Uncle Remus\u0027s cabin before dark. In some mysterious way, it appeared to the child, the gloom of twilight fastened itself upon the dusky clouds, and the great trees without, and the dismal perspective beyond, gradually became one with the darkness. Uncle Remus had thoughtfully placed a tin pan under a leak in the roof, and the drip-drip-drip of the water, as it fell in the resonant vessel, made a not unmusical accompaniment to the storm. The old man fumbled around under his bed, and presently dragged forth a large bag filled with lightwood knots, which, with an instinctive economy in this particular direction, he had stored away for an emergency. A bright but flickering flame was the result of this timely discovery, and the effect it produced was quite in keeping with all the surroundings. The rain, and wind, and darkness held sway without, while within, the unsteady lightwood blaze seemed to rhyme with the drip-drip-drip in the pan. Sometimes the shadow of Uncle Remus, as he leaned over the hearth, would tower and fill the cabin, and again it would fade and disappear among the swaying and swinging cobwebs that curtained the rafters. \"W\u0027en bed-time come, honey,\" said Uncle Remus, in a soothing tone, \"I\u0027ll des snatch down yo\u0027 pa buggy umbrell\u0027 fum up dar in de cornder, des lak I bin a-doin\u0027, en I\u0027ll take\u0027n take you und\u0027 my arm en set you down on Miss Sally h\u0027a\u0027th des ez dry en ez wom ez a rat\u0027-nes\u0027 inside a fodder-stack.\" At this juncture \u0027Tildy, the house-girl, rushed in out of the rain [50]and darkness with a water-proof cloak and an umbrella, and announced her mission to the little boy without taking time to catch her breath. \"Miss Sally say you got ter come right back,\" she exclaimed. \"Kaze she skeerd lightin\u0027 gwine strak \u0027roun\u0027 in yer \u0027mongs\u0027 deze high trees some\u0027rs.\" Uncle Remus rose from his stooping posture in front of the hearth and assumed a threatening attitude. \"Well, is anybody year de beat er dat!\" was his indignant exclamation. \"Look yer, gal! don\u0027t you come foolin\u0027 \u0027longer me—now, don\u0027t you do it. Kaze ef yer does, I\u0027ll take\u0027n hit you a clip w\u0027at\u0027ll put you ter bed \u0027fo\u0027 bed-times come. Dat\u0027s w\u0027at!\" \"Lawdy! w\u0027at I done gone en done ter Unk\u0027 Remus now?\" asked \u0027Tildy, with a great affectation of innocent ignorance. \"I\u0027m gwine ter put on my coat en take dat ar umbrell\u0027, en I\u0027m gwine right straight up ter de big house en ax Miss Sally ef she sont dat kinder wud down yer, w\u0027en she know dat chile sittin\u0027 yer \u0027longer me. I\u0027m gwine ter ax her,\" continued Uncle Remus, \"en if she ain\u0027t sont dat wud, den I\u0027m gwine ter fetch myse\u0027f back. Now, you des watch my motions.\" \"Well, I year Miss Sally say she \u0027feard lightnin\u0027 gwine ter strak some\u0027rs on de place,\" said \u0027Tildy, in a tone which manifested her willingness to compromise all differences, \"en den I axt \u0027er kin I come down yer, en den she say I better bring deze yer cloak en pairsol.\" \"Now you dun brung um,\" responded Uncle Remus, \"you des better put um in dat cheer over dar, en take yo\u0027se\u0027f off. Thunder mighty ap\u0027 ter hit close ter whar deze here slick-head niggers is.\" But the little boy finally prevailed upon the old man to allow \u0027Tildy to remain, and after a while he put matters on a peace footing by inquiring if roosters crowed at night when it was raining. \"Dat dey duz,\" responded Uncle Remus. \"Wet er dry, dey [51]flops der wings en wakes up all de neighbors. Law, bless my soul!\" he exclaimed suddenly, \"w\u0027at make I done gone en fergit \u0027bout Mr. Rooster?\" \"What about him?\" inquired the little boy. \"One time, \u0027way back yander,\" said Uncle Remus, knocking the ashes off his hands and knees, \"dey wuz two plan\u0027ations right \u0027longside one er \u0027ne\u0027r, en on bofe er deze plan\u0027ations wuz a whole passel of fowls. Dey wuz mighty sociable in dem days, en it tu\u0027n out dat de fowls on one plan\u0027ation gun a party, w\u0027ich dey sont out der invites ter de fowls on de \u0027t\u0027er plan\u0027ation. \"W\u0027en de day come, Mr. Rooster, he blow his hawn, he did, en \u0027semble um all tergedder, en atter dey \u0027semble dey got in line.
