{"id":10719,"no":61,"title":"LXI WHY MR. DOG RUNS BRER RABBIT","content":"The little boy was not particularly pleased at the summary manner in which the young Alligators were disposed of; but he was very much amused at the somewhat novel method employed by the Bear to deceive the old Alligator. The negroes, however, enjoyed Daddy Jack\u0027s story immensely, and even \u0027Tildy condescended to give it her approval; but she qualified this by saying, as soon as she had ceased laughing:— \"I \u0027clar\u0027 ter goodness you all got mighty little ter do fer ter be settin\u0027 down yer night atter night lis\u0027nin\u0027 at dat nigger man.\" Daddy Jack nodded, smiled, and rubbed his withered hands together apparently in a perfect ecstasy of good-humor, and finally said:— \"Oona come set-a by me, lil gal. \u0027E berry nice tale wut me tell-a you. Come sit-a by me, lil gal;\u0027e berry nice tale. Ef you no want me fer tell-a you one tale, dun you is kin tell-a me one tale.\" \"Humph!\" exclaimed \u0027Tildy, contemptuously, \"you\u0027ll set over dar in dat cornder en dribble many\u0027s de long day \u0027fo\u0027 I tell you any tale.\" \"Look yer, gal!\" said Uncle Remus, pretending to ignore the queer courtship that seemed to be progressing between Daddy Jack and \u0027Tildy, \"you gittin\u0027 too ole fer ter be sawin\u0027 de a\u0027r wid yo \u0027head en squealin\u0027 lak a filly. Ef you gwine ter set wid folks, [296]you better do lak folks does. Sis Tempy dar ain\u0027t gwine on dat a-way, en she ain\u0027t think \u0027erse\u0027f too big fer ter set up dar en jine in wid us en tell a tale, needer.\" This was the first time that Uncle Remus had ever condescended to accord \u0027Tildy a place at his hearth on an equality with the rest of his company, and she seemed to be immensely tickled. A broad grin spread over her comely face as she exclaimed:— \"Oh! I \u0027clar\u0027 ter goodness, Unk Remus, I thought dat ole nigger man wuz des a-projickin\u0027 \u0027long wid me. Ef it come down ter settin\u0027 up yer \u0027long wid you all en tellin\u0027 a tale, I ain\u0027t \u0027nyin\u0027 but w\u0027at I got one dat you all ain\u0027t never year tell un, \u0027kaze dat ar Slim Jim w\u0027at Mars Ellick Akin got out\u0027n de speckerlater waggin,[77] he up\u0027n tell it dar at Riah\u0027s des \u0027fo\u0027 de patter-rollers tuck\u0027n slipt up on um.\" \"Dar now!\" remarked Aunt Tempy. \u0027Tildy laughed boisterously. \"W\u0027at de patter-rollers do wid dat ar Slim Jim?\" Uncle Remus inquired. \"Done nothin\u0027!\" exclaimed \u0027Tildy, with an air of humorous scorn. \"Time dey got in dar Slim Jim \u0027uz up de chimbly, en Riah \u0027uz noddin\u0027 in one cornder en me in de udder. Nobody never is ter know how dat ar long-leg nigger slick\u0027d up dat chimbly—dat dey ain\u0027t. He put one foot on de pot-rack,[78] en whar he put de t\u0027er foot I can\u0027t tell you.\" \"What was the story?\" asked the little boy. \"I boun\u0027 fer you, honey!\" exclaimed Uncle Remus. \"Well, den,\" said \u0027Tildy, settling herself comfortably, and bridling a little as Daddy Jack manifested a desire to give her his undivided attention,—\"well, den, dey wuz one time w\u0027en ole Brer Rabbit \u0027uz bleedz ter go ter town atter sump\u0027n\u0027 \u0027n\u0027er fer his [297]famerly, en he mos\u0027 \u0027shame\u0027 ter go \u0027kaze his shoes done wo\u0027 tetotally out.
