{"id":10727,"no":69,"title":"LXIX BRER FOX\u0027S FISH-TRAP","content":"The little boy wanted Uncle Remus to sing some more; but before the old man could either consent or refuse, the notes of a horn were heard in the distance. Uncle Remus lifted his hand to command silence, and bent his head in an attitude of attention. \"Des listen at dat!\" he exclaimed, with some show of indignation. \"Dat ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 in de roun\u0027 worl\u0027 but ole man Plato wid dat tin hawn er his\u0027n, en I boun\u0027 you he\u0027s a-drivin\u0027 de six mule waggin, en de waggin full er niggers fum de River place, en let \u0027lone dat, I boun\u0027 you deyer niggers strung out behime de waggin fer mo\u0027n a mile, en deyer all er comin\u0027 yer fer ter eat us all out\u0027n house en home, des \u0027kaze dey year folks say Chris\u0027mus mos\u0027 yer. Hit\u0027s mighty kuse unter me dat ole man Plato ain\u0027t done toot dat hawn full er holes long \u0027fo\u0027 dis. \"Yit I ain\u0027t blamin\u0027 um,\" Uncle Remus went on, with a sigh, after a little pause. \"Dem ar niggers bin livin\u0027 \u0027way off dar on de River place whar dey ain\u0027t no w\u0027ite folks twel dey er done in about run\u0027d wil\u0027. I ain\u0027t a-blamin\u0027 um, dat I ain\u0027t.\" Plato\u0027s horn—a long tin bugle—was by no means unmusical. Its range was limited, but in Plato\u0027s hands its few notes were both powerful and sweet. Presently the wagon arrived, and for a few minutes all was confusion, the negroes on the Home place running to greet the new-comers, who were mostly their relatives. A stranger hearing the shouts and outcries of these people would have been at a loss to account for the commotion. Even Uncle Remus went to his cabin door, and, with the little boy by his side, looked out upon the scene,—a tumult lit up by torches of resinous pine. The old man and the child were recognized, and for a few moments the air was filled with cries of:— \"Howdy, Unk Remus! Howdy, little Marster!\" [322]After a while Uncle Remus closed his door, laid away his tools, and drew his chair in front of the wide hearth. The child went and stood beside him, leaning his head against the old negro\u0027s shoulder, and the two—old age and youth, one living in the Past and the other looking forward only to the Future—gazed into the bed of glowing embers illuminated by a thin, flickering flame. Probably they saw nothing there, each being busy with his own simple thoughts; but their shadows, enlarged out of all proportion, and looking over their shoulders from the wall behind them, must have seen something, for, clinging together, they kept up a most incessant pantomime; and Plato\u0027s horn, which sounded again to call the negroes to supper after their journey, though it aroused Uncle Remus and the child from the contemplation of the fire, had no perceptible effect upon the Shadows. \"Dar go de vittles!\" said Uncle Remus, straightening himself. \"Dey tells me dat dem ar niggers on de River place got appetite same ez a mule. Let \u0027lone de vittles w\u0027at dey gits from Mars John, dey eats oodles en oodles er fish. Ole man Plato say dat de nigger on de River place w\u0027at ain\u0027t got a fish-baskit in de river er some intruss[85] in a fish-trap ain\u0027t no \u0027count w\u0027atsomever.\" Here Uncle Remus suddenly slapped himself upon the leg, and laughed uproariously; and when the little boy asked him what the matter was, he cried out:— \"Well, sir! Ef I ain\u0027t de fergittenest ole nigger twix\u0027 dis en Phillimerdelphy! Yer \u0027t is mos\u0027 Chris\u0027mus en I ain\u0027t tell you \u0027bout how Brer Rabbit do Brer Fox w\u0027ence dey bofe un um live on de river. I dunner w\u0027at de name er sense gittin\u0027 de marter \u0027long wid me.\" Of course the little boy wanted to know all about it, and Uncle Remus proceeded:— \"One time Brer Fox en Brer Rabbit live de on river. Atter dey bin livin\u0027 dar so long a time, Brer Fox \u0027low dat he got a mighty [323]hankerin\u0027 atter sump\u0027n\u0027 \u0027sides fresh meat, en he say he b\u0027leeve he make \u0027im a fish-trap. Brer Rabbit say he wish Brer Fox mighty well, but he ain\u0027t honin\u0027 atter fish hisse\u0027f, en ef he is he ain\u0027t got no time fer ter make no fish-trap. \"No marter fer dat, Brer Fox, he tuck\u0027n got \u0027im out some timber, he did, en he wuk nights fer ter make dat trap. Den w\u0027en he git it done, he tuck\u0027n hunt \u0027im a good place fer ter set it, en de way he sweat over dat ar trap wuz a sin—dat \u0027t wuz. \"Yit atter so long a time, he got \u0027er sot, en den he tuck\u0027n wash he face en han\u0027s en go home. All de time he \u0027uz fixin\u0027 un it up, Brer Rabbit \u0027uz settin\u0027 on de bank watchin\u0027 \u0027im. He sot dar, he did, en play in de water, en cut switches fer ter w\u0027ip at de snake-doctors,[86] en all dat time Brer Fox, he pull en haul en tote rocks fer ter hol\u0027 dat trap endurin\u0027 a freshet. \"Brer Fox went home en res\u0027 hisse\u0027f, en bimeby he go down fer ter see ef dey any fish in he trap. He sorter fear\u0027d er snakes, but he feel \u0027roun\u0027 en he feel \u0027roun\u0027, yit he ain\u0027t feel no fish. Den he go off. \"Bimeby, \u0027long todes de las\u0027 er de week, he go down en feel \u0027roun\u0027 \u0027g\u0027in, yit he ain\u0027t feel no fish. Hit keep on dis a-way twel Brer Fox git sorter fag out. He go en he feel, but dey ain\u0027t no fish dar. Atter w\u0027ile, one day, he see de signs whar somebody bin robbin\u0027 he trap, en he \u0027low ter hisse\u0027f dat he\u0027ll des in \u0027bout watch en fine out who de somebody is. \"Den he tuck\u0027n got in he boat en paddle und\u0027 de bushes on de bank en watch he fish-trap. He watch all de mornin\u0027; nobody ain\u0027t come. He watch all endurin\u0027 er atter dinner; nobody ain\u0027t come. \u0027Long todes night, w\u0027en he des \u0027bout makin\u0027 ready fer ter paddle off home, he year fuss on t\u0027er side de river, en lo en beholes, yer come Brer Rabbit polin\u0027 a boat right todes Brer Fox fish-trap. \"Look lak he dunner how to use a paddle, en he des had \u0027im [324]a long pole, en he\u0027d stan\u0027 up in de behime part er he boat, en put de een\u0027 er de pole \u0027gin\u0027 de bottom, en shove \u0027er right ahead. \"Brer Fox git mighty mad w\u0027en he see dis, but he watch en wait. He \u0027low ter hisse\u0027f, he did, dat he kin paddle a boat pearter dan anybody kin pole um, en he say he sho\u0027ly gwine ketch Brer Rabbit dis time. \"Brer Rabbit pole up ter de fish-trap, en feel \u0027roun\u0027 en pull out a great big mud-cat; den he retch in en pull out \u0027n\u0027er big mud-cat; den he pull out a big blue cat, en it keep on dis a-way twel he git de finest mess er fish you mos\u0027 ever laid yo\u0027 eyes on. \"Des \u0027bout dat time, Brer Fox paddle out fum und\u0027 de bushes, en make todes Brer Rabbit, en he holler out:— \"\u0027Ah-yi!

Now, den,\" continued Uncle Remus, spreading out the palm of his left hand like a map and pointing at it with the forefinger of his right, \"w\u0027en Brer Rabbit pole he boat, he bleedz ter set in de behime een\u0027, en w\u0027en Brer Fox paddle he boat, he bleedz ter set in de behime een\u0027.
