{"id":10686,"no":28,"title":"XXVII BRER WOLF SAYS GRACE","content":"\u0027Tildy, the house-girl, made such a terrible report of the carryings on of Daddy Jack that the little boy\u0027s mother thought it prudent not to allow him to visit Uncle Remus so often. The child amused himself as best he could for several nights, but his play-things and picture-books finally lost their interest. He cried so hard to be allowed to go to see Uncle Remus that his mother placed him under the care of Aunt Tempy,—a woman of large authority on the place, and who stood next to Uncle Remus in the confidence of her mistress. Aunt Tempy was a fat, middle-aged woman, who always wore a head-handkerchief, and kept her sleeves rolled up, displaying her plump, black arms, winter and summer. She never hesitated to exercise her authority, and the younger negroes on the place regarded her as a tyrant; but in spite of her loud voice and brusque manners she was thoroughly good-natured, usually good-humored, and always trustworthy. Aunt Tempy and Uncle Remus were secretly jealous of each [124]other, but they were careful never to come in conflict, and, to all appearances, the most cordial relations existed between them. \"Well de goodness knows!\" exclaimed Uncle Remus, as Aunt Tempy went in with the little boy. \"How you come on, Sis Tempy? De rainy season ain\u0027t so mighty fur off w\u0027en you come a-sojourneyin\u0027 in dis house. Ef I\u0027d a-know\u0027d you\u0027d a-bin a-comin\u0027 I\u0027d a-sorter steered \u0027roun\u0027 en bresh\u0027d de cobwebs out\u0027n de cornders.\" \"Don\u0027t min\u0027 me, Brer Remus. Luck in de house whar de cobwebs hangs low. I \u0027uz des a-passin\u0027—a-passin\u0027 \u0027long—en Miss Sally ax me ef I kin come fur ez de do\u0027 wid dat chile dar, but bless you, \u0027t ain\u0027t in my manners ter tu\u0027n back at de do\u0027. How you come on, Brer Remus?\" \"Po\u0027ly, Sis Tempy; en yit I ain\u0027t complainin\u0027. Pain yer, en a ketch yander, wid de cramps th\u0027ow\u0027d in, ain\u0027t no mo\u0027 dan ole folks kin \u0027speck. How you is, Sis Tempy?\" \"I thank de Lord I\u0027m able to crawl, Brer Remus, en dat\u0027s \u0027bout all. Ef I wa\u0027n\u0027t so sot in my ways, deze yer niggers would er run me \u0027stracted d\u0027reckly.\" Daddy Jack was sitting in the corner laughing and talking to himself, and the little boy watched him not without a feeling of awe. After a while he said:— \"Uncle Remus, won\u0027t Daddy Jack tell us a story to-night?\" \"Now, den, honey,\" responded the old man, \"we ain\u0027t got ter push Brer Jack too closte; we ull des hatter creep up on \u0027im en ketch \u0027im fer er tale wence he in de humors. Sometimes hoss pull, sometime he ain\u0027t pull. You ain\u0027t bin down yer so long, hit sorter look lak it my tu\u0027n; \u0027kaze it done come \u0027cross my \u0027membunce dat dey wuz one time w\u0027en Brer Wolf kotch Brer Rabbit, w\u0027ich I ain\u0027t never gun it out ter you yit.\" \"Brother Wolf caught Brother Rabbit, Uncle Remus?\" exclaimed the little boy, incredulously. \"Yasser! dat\u0027s de up en down un it, sho\u0027,\" responded the old [125]man with emphasis, \"en I be mighty glad ef Sis Tempy yer will \u0027scuze me w\u0027iles I runs over de tale \u0027long wid you.\" \"Bless yo\u0027 soul, Brer Remus, don\u0027t pay no \u0027tention ter me,\" said Aunt Tempy, folding her fat arms upon her ample bosom, and assuming an attitude of rest and contentment. \"I\u0027m bad ez de chillun \u0027bout dem ole tales, \u0027kaze I kin des set up yer un lissen at um de whole blessid night, un a good part er de day. Yass, Lord!\" \"Well, den,\" said Uncle Remus, \"we ull des huddle up yer en see w\u0027at \u0027come er Brer Rabbit, w\u0027en ole Brer Wolf kotch \u0027im. In dem days,\" he continued, looking at Daddy Jack and smiling broadly, \"de creeturs wuz constant gwine a-courtin\u0027. Ef \u0027t wa\u0027n\u0027t Miss Meadows en de gals dey wuz flyin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027, hit \u0027uz Miss Motts. Dey wuz constant a-courtin\u0027.

W\u0027en Brer Rabbit git ter whar Miss Motts live, she done gone off some\u0027rs. \"Some folks \u0027ud er sot down en wait twel Miss Motts come back, en den ag\u0027in some folks \u0027ud er tuck der foot in der han\u0027 en went back; but ole Brer Rabbit, he ain\u0027t de man fer ter be outdone, en he des tuck\u0027n go in de kitchen en light he seegyar, en den he put out fer ter pay a call on Miss Meadows en de gals. \"W\u0027en he git dar, lo en beholes, he fine Miss Motts dar, en he tipped in, ole Brer Rabbit did, en he galanted \u0027roun\u0027 \u0027mungs um, same lak one er dese yer town chaps, w\u0027at you see come out ter Harmony Grove meetin\u0027-house.

I boun\u0027 Brer Wolf nail\u0027t \u0027im.\" \"Time Brer Wolf grab \u0027im,\" continued Uncle Remus, \"Brer Rabbit knowed he \u0027uz a gone case; yit he sing out, he did:— \"\u0027I des tryin\u0027 ter skeer you, Brer Wolf; I des tryin\u0027 ter skeer you. I know\u0027d you \u0027uz in dar, Brer Wolf, I know\u0027d you by de smell!\u0027 sez Brer Rabbit, sezee. \"Ole Brer Wolf grin, he did, en lick he chops, en up\u0027n say:— \"\u0027Mighty glad you know\u0027d me, Brer Rabbit, \u0027kaze I know\u0027d you des time you drapt in on me. I tuck\u0027n tell Brer Fox yistiddy dat I \u0027uz gwine take a nap \u0027longside er de road, en I boun\u0027 you \u0027ud [127]come \u0027long en wake me up, en sho\u0027 nuff, yer you come en yer you is,\u0027 sez Brer Wolf, sezee. \"Oh-ho, Mr. Rabbit! How you feel now?\" exclaimed Aunt Tempy, her sympathies evidently with Brother Wolf. \"W\u0027en Brer Rabbit year dis,\" said Uncle Remus, paying no attention to the interruption, \"he \u0027gun ter git mighty skeer\u0027d, en he whirl in en beg Brer Wolf fer ter please tu\u0027n \u0027im loose; but dis make Brer Wolf grin wusser, en he toof look so long en shine so w\u0027ite, en he gum look so red, dat Brer Rabbit hush up en stay still. He so skeer\u0027d dat he bref come quick, en he heart go lak flutter-mill. He chune up lak he gwine cry:— \"\u0027Whar you gwine kyar me, Brer Wolf?\u0027 \"\u0027Down by de branch, Brer Rabbit.\u0027 \"\u0027W\u0027at you gwine down dar fer, Brer Wolf?\u0027 \"\u0027So I kin git some water ter clean you wid atter I done skunt you, Brer Rabbit.\u0027 \"\u0027Please, sir, lemme go, Brer Wolf.\u0027 \"\u0027You talk so young you make me laff, Brer Rabbit.\u0027 \"\u0027Dat sparrer-grass done make me sick, Brer Wolf.\u0027 \"\u0027You\u0027ll be sicker\u0027n dat \u0027fo\u0027 I git done wid you, Brer Rabbit.\u0027 \"\u0027Whar I come fum nobody dast ter eat sick folks, Brer Wolf.\u0027 \"\u0027Whar I come fum dey ain\u0027t dast ter eat no yuther kin\u0027, Brer Rabbit.\u0027\" \"Ole Mr. Rabbit wuz a-talkin\u0027, mon,\" said Aunt Tempy, with a chuckle that caused her to shake like a piece of jelly. \"Dey went on dis a-way,\" continued Uncle Remus, \"plum twel dey git ter de branch. Brer Rabbit, he beg en cry, en cry en beg, en Brer Wolf, he \u0027fuse en grin, en grin en \u0027fuse. W\u0027en dey come ter de branch, Brer Wolf lay Brer Rabbit down on de groun\u0027 en hilt \u0027im dar, en den he study how he gwine make way wid \u0027im. He study en he study, en w\u0027iles he studyin\u0027 Brer Rabbit, he tuck\u0027n study some on he own hook. \"Den w\u0027en it seem lak Brer Wolf done fix all de \u0027rangerments, [128]Brer Rabbit, he make lak he cryin\u0027 wusser en wusser; he des fa\u0027rly blubber.\" Uncle Remus gave a ludicrous imitation of Brother Rabbit\u0027s wailings. \"\u0027Ber—ber—Brer Wooly—ooly—oolf!

Uncle Remus laughed knowingly and went on:— \"Brer Wolf, he put up he han\u0027s, he did, en shot he eyes, en \u0027low, \u0027Bless us en bine us;\u0027 but he ain\u0027t git no furder, \u0027kaze des time he take up he han\u0027s, Brer Rabbit fotch a wiggle, he did, en lit on he foots, en he des nat\u0027ally lef a blue streak behime \u0027im.\" \"Ah-yi-ee!\" exclaimed Daddy Jack, while Aunt Tempy allowed her arms to drop helplessly from her lap as she cried \"Dar now!\" and the little boy clasped his hands in an ecstasy of admiration. \"Oh, I just knew Brother Rabbit would get away,\" the child declared.

When Aunt Tempy rose to go she said:— \"Goodness knows, Brer Remus, ef dis de way you all runs on, I\u0027m gwine ter pester you some mo\u0027. Hit come \u0027cross me like ole times, dat it do.\" \"Do so, Sis Tempy, do so,\" said Uncle Remus, with dignified hospitality. \"You allers fine a place at my h\u0027a\u0027th. Ole times is about all we got lef\u0027.\" \"Trufe, too!\" exclaimed Aunt Tempy; and with that she took the child by the hand and went out into the darkness. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2808/77608.html","bookId":505,"book":{"id":505,"title":"Nights With Uncle Remus","description":"简介： It had been raining all day so that Uncle Remus found it impossible to go out.
