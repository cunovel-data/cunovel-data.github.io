{"id":10712,"no":54,"title":"LIV OLD GRINNY-GRANNY WOLF","content":"At last Daddy Jack returned, and the fact that the little boy had missed him and inquired about him, seemed to give the old African particular pleasure. It was probably a new experience to Daddy Jack, and it vaguely stirred some dim instinct in his bosom that impelled him to greet the child with more genuine heartiness than he had ever displayed in all his life. He drew the little boy up to him, patted him gently on the cheek, and exclaimed:— \"Ki! I bin want fer see you bery bahd. I bin-a tell you\u0027 nunk Jeem\u0027 how fine noung màn you is. \u0027E ahx wey you no come fer shum. Fine b\u0027y—fine b\u0027y!\" \"Well, ef dat\u0027s de way youer gwine on, Brer Jack, you\u0027ll spile dat chap sho\u0027. A whole sack er salt won\u0027t save \u0027im.\" \"I dunno \u0027bout dat, Brer Remus,\" said Aunt Tempy, who had come in. \"Don\u0027t seem like he bad like some yuther childun w\u0027at I seen. Bless you, I know childun w\u0027at\u0027d keep dish yer whole place tarryfied—dat dey would!\" \"Well, sir,\" said Uncle Remus, shaking his head and groaning, \"you all ain\u0027t wid dat young un dar much ez I is. Some days w\u0027en dey ain\u0027t nobody lookin\u0027, en dey ain\u0027t nobody nowhar fer ter take keer un me, dat ar little chap dar \u0027ll come down yer en chunk me wid rocks, en \u0027buze me en holler at me scan\u0027lous.\" The little boy looked so shocked that Uncle Remus broke into a laugh that shook the cobwebs in the corners; then, suddenly relapsing into seriousness, he drew himself up with dignity and remarked:— \"Good er bad, you can\u0027t git \u0027long wid \u0027im less\u0027n you sets in ter tellin\u0027 tales, en, Brer Jack, I hope you got some \u0027long wid you.\" Daddy Jack rubbed his hands together, and said:— \"Me bin yeddy one tale; \u0027e mekky me lahff tel I is \u0027come tire\u0027.\" [264]\"Fer de Lord sake less have it den!\" exclaimed Aunt Tempy, with unction. Whereupon, the small but appreciative audience disposed itself comfortably, and Daddy Jack, peering at each one in turn, his eyes shining between his half-closed lids as brightly as those of some wild animal, began:— \"One tam B\u0027er Rabbit is bin traffel \u0027roun\u0027 fer see \u0027e neighbor folks. \u0027E bin mahd wit\u0027 B\u0027er Wolf fer so long tam; \u0027e mek no diffran, \u0027e come pas\u0027 \u0027e house \u0027e no see nuttin\u0027, \u0027e no yeddy nuttin\u0027. \u0027E holler:— \"\u0027Hi, B\u0027er Wolf! wey you no fer mek answer wun me ahx you howdy?

B\u0027er Rabbit, \u0027e holler:— \"\u0027Come-a show you\u0027se\u0027f, B\u0027er Wolf! Come-a show you\u0027se\u0027f.

Da fier is bin bu\u0027n, da pot is bin b\u0027ile; come-a fix you\u0027 Granny some bittle,[68] me gran\u0027son.\u0027\" Daddy Jack\u0027s representation of the speech and action of an old woman was worth seeing and hearing. The little boy laughed, and Uncle Remus smiled good-humoredly; but Aunt Tempy [265]looked at the old African with open-mouthed astonishment. Daddy Jack, however, cared nothing for any effect he might produce. He told the story for the story\u0027s sake, and he made no pause for the purpose of gauging the appreciation of his audience. \"B\u0027er Rabbit, \u0027e is bin mek \u0027ese\u0027f comfuts by da fier.

The little boy drew a long breath and said:— \"I did n\u0027t think Brother Rabbit would burn anybody to death in a pot of boiling water.\" \"Dat,\" said Uncle Remus, reassuringly, \"wuz endurin\u0027 er de dog days. Dey er mighty wom times, mon, dem ar dog days is.\" This was intended to satisfy such scruples as the child might [267]have, and it was no doubt successful, for the youngster said no more, but watched Uncle Remus as the latter leisurely proceeded to fill his pipe. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2808/77634.html","bookId":505,"book":{"id":505,"title":"Nights With Uncle Remus","description":"简介： It had been raining all day so that Uncle Remus found it impossible to go out.
