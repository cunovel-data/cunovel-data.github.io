{"id":10679,"no":21,"title":"XX BRER RABBIT TAKES SOME EXERCISE","content":"One night while the little boy was sitting in Uncle Remus\u0027s cabin, waiting for the old man to finish his hoe-cake, and refresh his memory as to the further adventures of Brother Rabbit, his friends and his enemies, something dropped upon the top of the house with a noise like the crack of a pistol. The little boy jumped, but Uncle Remus looked up and exclaimed, \"Ah-yi!\" in a tone of triumph. \"What was that, Uncle Remus?\" the child asked, after waiting a moment to see what else would happen. \"News fum Jack Fros\u0027, honey. W\u0027en dat hick\u0027y-nut tree out dar year \u0027im comin\u0027 she \u0027gins ter drap w\u0027at she got. I mighty glad,\" he continued, scraping the burnt crust from his hoe-cake with an old case-knife, \"I mighty glad hick\u0027y-nuts ain\u0027t big en heavy ez grinestones.\" He waited a moment to see what effect this queer statement would have on the child. \"Yasser, I mighty glad—dat I is. \u0027Kaze ef hick\u0027y-nuts \u0027uz big ez grinestones dish yer ole callyboose \u0027ud be a-leakin\u0027 long \u0027fo\u0027 Chris\u0027mus.\" Just then another hickory-nut dropped upon the roof, and the [90]little boy jumped again. This seemed to amuse Uncle Remus, and he laughed until he was near to choking himself with his smoking hoe-cake. \"You does des \u0027zackly lak ole Brer Rabbit done, I \u0027clar\u0027 to gracious ef you don\u0027t!\" the old man cried, as soon as he could get his breath; \"dez zackly fer de worl\u0027.\" The child was immensely flattered, and at once he wanted to know how Brother Rabbit did. Uncle Remus was in such good humor that he needed no coaxing. He pushed his spectacles back on his forehead, wiped his mouth on his sleeve, and began:— \"Hit come \u0027bout dat soon one mawnin\u0027 todes de fall er de year, Brer Rabbit wuz stirrin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027 in de woods atter some bergamot fer ter make \u0027im some h\u0027ar-grease.
