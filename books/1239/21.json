{"id":31101,"no":21,"title":"XXI. A WHALEMAN AND A MAN-OF-WAR\u0027S-MAN","content":"The sight of the whales mentioned in the preceding chapter was the bringing out of Larry, one of our crew, who hitherto had been quite silent and reserved, as if from some conscious inferiority, though he had shipped as an ordinary seaman, and, for aught I could see, performed his duty very well. When the men fell into a dispute concerning what kind of whales they were which we saw, Larry stood by attentively, and after garnering in their ignorance, all at once broke out, and astonished every body by his intimate acquaintance with the monsters. \"They ar\u0027n\u0027t sperm whales,\" said Larry, \"their spouts ar\u0027n\u0027t bushy enough; they ar\u0027n\u0027t Sulphur-bottoms, or they wouldn\u0027t stay up so long; they ar\u0027n\u0027t Hump-backs, for they ar\u0027n\u0027t got any humps; they ar\u0027n\u0027t Fin-backs, for you won\u0027t catch a Finback so near a ship; they ar\u0027n\u0027t Greenland whales, for we ar\u0027n\u0027t off the coast of Greenland; and they ar\u0027n\u0027t right whales, for it wouldn\u0027t be right to say so. I tell ye, men, them\u0027s Crinkum-crankum whales.\" \"And what are them?\" said a sailor. \"Why, them is whales that can\u0027t be cotched.\" Now, as it turned out that this Larry had been bred to the sea in a whaler, and had sailed out of Nantucket many times; no one but Jackson ventured to dispute his opinion; and even Jackson did not press him very hard. And ever after, Larry\u0027s judgment was relied upon concerning all strange fish that happened to float by us during the voyage; for whalemen are far more familiar with the wonders of the deep than any other class of seaman. This was Larry\u0027s first voyage in the merchant service, and that was the reason why, hitherto, he had been so reserved; since he well knew that merchant seamen generally affect a certain superiority to \"blubber-boilers,\" as they contemptuously style those who hunt the leviathan. But Larry turned out to be such an inoffensive fellow, and so well understood his business aboard ship, and was so ready to jump to an order, that he was exempted from the taunts which he might otherwise have encountered. He was a somewhat singular man, who wore his hat slanting forward over the bridge of his nose, with his eyes cast down, and seemed always examining your boots, when speaking to you. I loved to hear him talk about the wild places in the Indian Ocean, and on the coast of Madagascar, where he had frequently touched during his whaling voyages. And this familiarity with the life of nature led by the people in that remote part of the world, had furnished Larry with a sentimental distaste for civilized society. When opportunity offered, he never omitted extolling the delights of the free and easy Indian Ocean. \"Why,\" said Larry, talking through his nose, as usual, \"in Madagasky there, they don\u0027t wear any togs at all, nothing but a bowline round the midships; they don\u0027t have no dinners, but keeps a dinin\u0027 all day off fat pigs and dogs; they don\u0027t go to bed any where, but keeps a noddin\u0027 all the time; and they gets drunk, too, from some first rate arrack they make from cocoa-nuts; and smokes plenty of \u0027baccy, too, I tell ye. Fine country, that! Blast Ameriky, I say!\" To tell the truth, this Larry dealt in some illiberal insinuations against civilization. \"And what\u0027s the use of bein\u0027 snivelized!\" said he to me one night during our watch on deck; \"snivelized chaps only learns the way to take on \u0027bout life, and snivel. You don\u0027t see any Methodist chaps feelin\u0027 dreadful about their souls; you don\u0027t see any darned beggars and pesky constables in Madagasky, I tell ye; and none o\u0027 them kings there gets their big toes pinched by the gout. Blast Ameriky, I say.\" Indeed, this Larry was rather cutting in his innuendoes. \"Are you now, Buttons, any better off for bein\u0027 snivelized?\" coming close up to me and eying the wreck of my gaff-topsail-boots very steadfastly. \"No; you ar\u0027n\u0027t a bit—but you\u0027re a good deal worse for it, Buttons. I tell ye, ye wouldn\u0027t have been to sea here, leadin\u0027 this dog\u0027s life, if you hadn\u0027t been snivelized—that\u0027s the cause why, now. Snivelization has been the ruin on ye; and it\u0027s spiled me complete; I might have been a great man in Madagasky; it\u0027s too darned bad! Blast Ameriky, I say.\" And in bitter grief at the social blight upon his whole past, present, and future, Larry turned away, pulling his hat still lower down over the bridge of his nose. In strong contrast to Larry, was a young man-of-war\u0027s man we had, who went by the name of \"Gun-Deck,\" from his always talking of sailor life in the navy. He was a little fellow with a small face and a prodigious mop of brown hair; who always dressed in man-of-war style, with a wide, braided collar to his frock, and Turkish trowsers. But he particularly prided himself upon his feet, which were quite small; and when we washed down decks of a morning, never mind how chilly it might be, he always took off his boots, and went paddling about like a duck, turning out his pretty toes to show his charming feet. He had served in the armed steamers during the Seminole War in Florida, and had a good deal to say about sailing up the rivers there, through the everglades, and popping off Indians on the banks. I remember his telling a story about a party being discovered at quite a distance from them; but one of the savages was made very conspicuous by a pewter plate, which he wore round his neck, and which glittered in the sun. This plate proved his death; for, according to Gun-Deck, he himself shot it through the middle, and the ball entered the wearer\u0027s heart. It was a rat-killing war, he said. Gun-Deck had touched at Cadiz: had been to Gibraltar; and ashore at Marseilles. He had sunned himself in the Bay of Naples: eaten figs and oranges in Messina; and cheerfully lost one of his hearts at Malta, among the ladies there. And about all these things, he talked like a romantic man-of-war\u0027s man, who had seen the civilized world, and loved it; found it good, and a comfortable place to live in. So he and Larry never could agree in their respective views of civilization, and of savagery, of the Mediterranean and Madagasky.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2832/78276.html","bookId":1239,"book":{"id":1239,"title":"Redburn.
