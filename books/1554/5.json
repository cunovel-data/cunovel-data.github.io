{"id":108155,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u0027Seems to me I\u0027m getting all balled up in high politics. Not my line of country at all. But is this stuff really as vital as M. says?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely. If you get hold of it, your grateful country will probably buy you that chicken farm you\u0027re always talking about.\u0027 \u0027So be it. Now, if you\u0027ll give Hamilton a buzz I\u0027ll go and start learning all about the mysterious East.\u0027 \u0027Kangei! Welcome aboard,\u0027 said the pretty kimono-ed and obi-ed stewardess of Japan Air Lines as, a week later, James Bond settled into the comfortable window seat of the four-jet, turbofan Douglas D C 8 at London Airport and listened to the torrent of soft Japanese coming from the tannoy that would be saying all those things about life jackets and the flying time to Orly. The sick-bags \u0027in case of motion disturbance\u0027 were embellished with pretty bamboo emblems and, according to the exquisitely bound travel folder, the random scribbles on the luggage rack above his head were\u0027the traditional and auspicious tortoiseshell motif. The stewardess bowed and handed him a dainty fan, a small hot towel in a wicker-basket and a sumptuous menu that included a note to the effect that an assortment of cigarettes, perfumes and pearls were available for sale. Then they were off with 50,000 pounds of thrust on the first leg of the four that would take the good aircraft Yoshino over the North Pole to Tokyo. Bond gazed at the picture of three oranges (no! after an hour he decided they were persimmons) in a blue bowl that faced him and, when the aircraft flattened out at 30,000 feet, ordered the first of the chain of brandies and ginger ales that was to sustain him over the Channel, a leg of the North Sea, the Kattegat, the Arctic Ocean, the Beaufort Sea, the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean and decided that, whatever happened on this impossible assignment, he would put up no resistance to his old skin being sloughed off him on the other side of the world. By the time he was admiring the huge stuffed Polar bear at Anchorage, in Alaska, the embrace of JAL\u0027s soft wings had persuaded him that he didn\u0027t even mind if the colour of the new skin was to be yellow. 4 DIKKO ON THE GINZA THE huge right fist crashed into the left palm with the noise of a .45 pistol shot. The great square face of the Australian turned almost purple and the veins stood out on the grizzled temples. With controlled violence, but almost under his breath, he intoned savagely. \u0027I bludge, Thou bludgest, He bludges, We bludge, You bludge, They all bludge.\u0027 He reached under the low table and then seemed to think better of it and moved his hand to the glass of sake, picked it up and poured it down his throat without a swallow. Bond said mildly, \u0027Take it easy, Dikko. What\u0027s bitten you? And what does this vulgar-sounding colonial expression mean?\u0027 Richard Lovelace Henderson, of Her Majesty\u0027s Australian Diplomatic Corps, looked belligerently round the small crowded bar in a by-street off the Ginza and said out of the corner of his large and usually cheerful mouth that was now turned down in bitterness and anger, \u0027You stupid pommy bastard, we\u0027ve been miked! That bludger Tanaka\u0027s miked us! Here, under the table! See the little wire down the leg? And see that wingy over at the bar? Chap with one arm looking bloody respectable in his blue suit and black tie? That\u0027s one of Tiger\u0027s men. I can smell \u0027em by now. They\u0027ve been tailing me off and on for ten years. Tiger dresses \u0027em all like little CIA gentlemen. You watch out for any Jap who\u0027s drinking Western and wearing that rig. All Tiger\u0027s men.\u0027 He grumbled, \u0027Damn good mind to go over and call the bastard.\u0027 Bond said, \u0027Well, if we\u0027re being miked, all this\u0027ll make sweet reading for Mr Tanaka tomorrow morning.\u0027 \u0027What the hell,\u0027 said Dikko Henderson resignedly. \u0027The old bastard knows what I think of him. Now he\u0027ll just have it in writing. Teach him to stop leaning on me. And my friends,\u0027 he added, with a blistering glance at Bond. \u0027It\u0027s really you he wants to size up. And I don\u0027t mind if he hears me saying so. Bludger? Well, hear me now, Tiger! This is the great Australian insult. You can use it anyways.\u0027 He raised his voice. \u0027But in general it means a worthless pervert, ponce, scoundrel, liar, traitor and rogue - with no redeeming feature. And I hope your stewed seaweed sticks in your gullet at breakfast tomorrow when you know what I think of you.\u0027 Bond laughed. The torrent of powerful swear-words had started its ceaseless flow the day before at the airport - Haneda, \u0027the field of wings\u0027. It had taken Bond nearly an hour to extract his single suitcase from the customs area, and he had emerged fuming into the central hall only to be jostled and pushed aside by an excited crowd of young Japanese bearing paper banners that said \u0027International Laundry Convention\u0027. Bond was exhausted from his flight. He let out one single four-letter expletive. Behind him a big voice repeated the same word and added some more. \u0027That\u0027s my boy! That\u0027s the right way to greet the East! You\u0027ll be needing all those words and more before you\u0027re through with the area.\u0027 Bond had turned. The huge man in the rumpled grey suit thrust out a hand as big as a small ham. \u0027Glad to meet you. I\u0027m Henderson. As you were the only pommy on the plane, I guess you\u0027re Bond. Here. Give me that bag. Got a car outside and the sooner we get away from this blankety blank madhouse the better.\u0027 Henderson looked like a middle-aged prize fighter who has retired and taken to the bottle. His thin suit bulged with muscle round the arms and shoulders and with fat round the waist. He had a craggy, sympathetic face, rather stony blue eyes, and a badly broken nose. He was sweating freely (Bond was to find that he was always sweating), and as he barged his way through the crowd, using Bond\u0027s suitcase as a battering ram, he extracted a rumpled square of terry cloth from his trouser-pocket and wiped it round his neck and face. The crowd parted unresentfully to let the giant through, and Bond followed in his wake to a smart Toyopet saloon waiting in a no-parking area. The chauffeur got out and bowed. Henderson fired a torrent of instructions at him in fluent Japanese and followed Bond into the back seat, settling himself with a grunt. \u0027Taking you to your hotel first - the Okura, latest of the Western ones. American tourist got murdered at the Royal Oriental the other day and we don\u0027t want to lose you all that soon. Then we\u0027ll do a bit of serious drinking. Had some dinner?\u0027 \u0027About six of them, as far as I can remember. J AL certainly takes good care of your stomach.\u0027 \u0027Why did you choose the willow-pattern route? How was the old ruptured duck?\u0027 \u0027They told me the bird was a crane. Very dainty. But efficient. Thought I might as well practise being inscrutable before plunging into all this.\u0027 Bond waved at the cluttered shambles of the Tokyo suburbs through which they were tearing at what seemed to Bond a suicidal speed. \u0027Doesn\u0027t look the most attractive city in the world. And why are we driving on the left?\u0027 \u0027God knows,\u0027 said Henderson moodily. \u0027The bloody Japs do everything the wrong way round. Read the old instruction books wrong, I daresay. Light switches go up instead of down. Taps turn to the left. Door handles likewise. Why, they even race their horses clockwise instead of anti-clockwise like civilized people. As for Tokyo, it\u0027s bloody awful. It\u0027s either too hot or too cold or pouring with rain. And there\u0027s an earthquake about every day. But don\u0027t worry about them. They just make you feel slightly drunk. The typhoons are worse. If one starts to blow, go into the stoutest bar you can see and get drunk. But the first ten years are the worst. It\u0027s got its point when you know your way around. Bloody expensive if you live Western, but I stick to the back alleys and do all right. Really quite exhilarating. Got to know the lingo though, and when to bow and take off your shoes and so on. You\u0027ll have to get the basic routines straight pretty quickly if you\u0027re going to make any headway with the people you\u0027ve come to see. Underneath the stiff collars and striped pants in the government departments, there\u0027s still plenty of the old samurai tucked away. I laugh at them for it, and they laugh back because they\u0027ve got to know my line of patter. But that doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t bow from the waist when I know it\u0027s expected of me and when I want something. You\u0027ll get the hang of it all right.\u0027 Henderson fired some Japanese at the driver who had been glancing frequently in his driving mirror. The driver laughed and replied cheerfully. \u0027Thought so,\u0027 said Henderson. \u0027We\u0027ve got ourselves a tail. Typical of old Tiger. I told him you were staying at the Okura, but he wants to make sure for himself. Don\u0027t worry. It\u0027s just part of his crafty ways. If you find one of his men breathing down your neck in bed tonight, or a girl if you\u0027re lucky, just talk to them politely and they\u0027ll bow and hiss themselves out.\u0027 But a solitary sleep had followed the serious drinking in the Bamboo Bar of the Okura, and the next day had been spent doing the sights and getting some cards printed that described Bond as Second Secretary in the Cultural Department of the Australian Embassy. \u0027They know that\u0027s our intelligence side,\u0027 said Henderson, \u0027and they know I\u0027m the head of it and you\u0027re my temporary assistant, so why not spell it out for them?\u0027 And that evening they had gone for more serious drinking to Henderson\u0027s favourite bar, Melody\u0027s, off the Ginza, where everybody called Henderson \u0027Dikko\u0027 or \u0027Dikko-san\u0027, and where they were ushered respectfully to the quiet corner table that appeared to be his Stammtisch. And now Henderson reached under the table and, with a powerful wrench, pulled out the wires and left them hanging. \u0027I\u0027ll give that black bastard Melody hell for this when I get around to it,\u0027 he said belligerently. \u0027And to think of all I\u0027ve done for the dingo bastard! Used to be a favourite pub of the English Colony and the Press Club layabouts. Had a good restaurant attached to it. That\u0027s gone now. The Eyteye cook trod on the cat and spilled the soup and he picked up the cat and threw it into the cooking stove. Of course that got around pretty quick, and all the animal-lovers and sanctimonious bastards got together and tried to have Melody\u0027s licence taken away. I managed to put in squeeze in the right quarter and saved him, but everyone quit his restaurant and he had to close it. I\u0027m the only regular who\u0027s stuck to him. And now he goes and does this to me! Oh well, he\u0027ll have had the squeeze put on him, I suppose. Anyway, that\u0027s the end of the tape so far as T.T.\u0027s concerned. I\u0027ll give him hell too. He ought to have learned by now that me and my friends don\u0027t want to assassinate the Emperor or blow up the Diet or something.\u0027 Dikko glared around him as if he proposed to do both those things. \u0027Now then, James, to business. I\u0027ve fixed up for you to meet Tiger tomorrow morning at eleven. I\u0027ll pick you up and take you there. “The Bureau of All-Asian Folkways.” I won\u0027t describe it to you. It\u0027d spoil it. Now, I don\u0027t really know what you\u0027re here for. Spate of top secret cables from Melbourne. To be deciphered by yours truly in person. Thanks very much! And my Ambassador, Jim Saunderson, good bloke, says he doesn\u0027t want to know anything about it. Thinks it\u0027d be even better if he didn\u0027t meet you at all. Okay with you? No offence, but he\u0027s a wise guy and likes to keep his hands clean. And I don\u0027t want to know anything about your job either. That way, you\u0027re the only one who gets the powdered bamboo in his coffee. But I gather you want to get some high-powered gen out of Tiger without the CIA knowing anything about it. Right? Well that\u0027s going to be a dicey business. Tiger\u0027s a career man with a career mind. Although, on the surface, he\u0027s a hundred per cent demokorasu, he\u0027s a deep one -very deep indeed. The American occupation and the American influence here look like a very solid basis for a total American-Japanese alliance. But once a Jap, always a Jap. It\u0027s the same with all the other great nations - Chinese, Russian, German, English. It\u0027s their bones that matter, not their lying faces. And all those races have got tremendous bones. Compared with the bones, the smiles or scowls don\u0027t mean a thing. And time means nothing for them either. Ten years is the blink of a star for the big ones. Get me? So Tiger, and his superiors, who, I suppose, are the Diet and, in the end, the Emperor, will look at your proposition principally from two angles. Is it immediately desirable, today? Or is it a long-term investment? Something that may pay off for the country in ten, twenty years. And, if I were you, I\u0027d stick to that spiel - the long-term talk. These people, people like Tiger, who\u0027s an absolutely top man in Japan, don\u0027t think in terms of days or months or years. They think in terms of centuries. Quite right, when you come to think of it.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/you-only-live-twice-james-bond-12/page-5.html","bookId":1554,"book":{"id":1554,"title":"You Only Live Twice (James Bond #12)","description":"Storyline: You Only Live Twice (James Bond (Original Series) #12) Bond, a shattered man after the death of his wife at the hands of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, has gone to pieces as an agent, endangering himself and his fellow operatives.
