{"id":108152,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Tiger said, \u0027Three games of three?\u0027 \u0027Right.\u0027 The two fists rose slowly from the table top, quickly hammered twice in unison and shot forward. Tiger had kept his fist balled in the Stone. Bond\u0027s palm was open in the Paper that wrapped the Stone. One up to Bond. Again the ritual and the moment of truth. Tiger had kept to the Stone. Bond\u0027s first and second fingers were open in the Scissors, blunted by Tiger\u0027s Stone. One all. Tiger paused and placed his fist against his forehead. He closed his eyes in thought. He said, \u0027Yes. I\u0027ve got you, Bondo-san. You can\u0027t escape.\u0027 \u0027Good show,\u0027 said Bond, trying to clear his mind of the suspicion that Tiger would keep to the Stone, or alternatively, that Tiger would expect him to play it that way, expect Bond to play the Paper and himself riposte with the Scissors to cut the paper. And so on and so forth. The three emblems whirled round in Bond\u0027s mind like the symbols on a fruit machine. The two fists were raised - one, two, forward! Tiger had kept to his Stone. Bond had wrapped it up with the Paper. First game to Bond. The second game lasted longer. They both kept on showing the same symbol, which meant a replay. It was as if the two players were getting the measure of each other\u0027s psychology. But that could not be so, since Bond had no psychological intent. He continued to play at random. It was just luck. Tiger won the game. One all. Last game! The two contestants looked at each other. Bond\u0027s smile was bland, rather mocking. A glint of red shone in the depths of Tiger\u0027s dark eyes. Bond saw it and said to himself, \u0027I would be wise to lose. Or would I?\u0027 He won the game in two straight goes, blunting Tiger\u0027s Scissors with his Stone, wrapping Tiger\u0027s Stone with his Paper. Tiger bowed low. Bond bowed even lower. He sought for a throwaway remark. He said, \u0027I must get this game adopted in time for your Olympics. I would certainly be chosen to play for my country.\u0027 Tiger Tanaka laughed with controlled politeness. \u0027You play with much insight. What was the secret of your method?\u0027 Bond had had no method. He quickly invented the one that would be most polite to Tiger. \u0027You are a man of rock and steel, Tiger. I guessed that the paper symbol would be the one you would use the least. I played accordingly.\u0027 This bit of mumbo-jumbo got by. Tiger bowed. Bond bowed and drank more sake, toasting Tiger. Released from the tension, the geisha applauded and the Madame instructed Trembling Leaf to give Bond another kiss. She did so. How soft the skins of Japanese women were! And their touch was almost weightless! James Bond was plotting the rest of his night when Tiger said, \u0027Bondo-san, I have matters to discuss with you. Will you do me the honour of coming to my house for a nightcap?\u0027 Bond immediately put away his lascivious thoughts.According to Dikko, to be invited to a Japanese private house was a most unusual sign of favour. So, for some reason, he had done right to win this childish game. This might mean great things. Bond bowed. \u0027Nothing would give me more pleasure, Tiger.\u0027 An hour later they were sitting in blessed chairs with a drink-tray between them. The lights of Yokohama glowed a deep orange along the horizon, and a slight smell of the harbour and the sea came in through the wide-open partition leading on to the garden. Tiger\u0027s house was designed, enchantingly, as is even the meanest Japanese salary-man\u0027s house, to establish the thinnest possible dividing line between the inhabitant and nature. The three other partitions in the square room were also fully slid back, revealing a bedroom, a small study and a passage. Tiger had opened the partitions when they entered the room. He had commented, \u0027In the West, when you have secrets to discuss, you shut all the doors and windows. In Japan, we throw everything open to make sure that no one can listen at the thin walls. And what I have now to discuss with you is a matter of the very highest secrecy. The sake is warm enough? You have the cigarettes you prefer? Then listen to what I have to say to you and swear on your honour to divulge it to no one.\u0027 Tiger Tanaka gave his great golden shout of mirthless laughter. \u0027If you were to break your promise, I would have no alternative but to remove you from the earth.\u0027 2 CURTAINS FOR BOND? EXACTLY one month before, it had been the eve of the annual closing of Blades. On the next day, 1 September, those members who were still unfashionably in London would have to pig it for a month at Whites or Boodle\u0027s. Whites they considered noisy and\u0027smart\u0027, Boodle\u0027s too full of superannuated country squires who would be talking of nothing but the opening of the partridge season. For Blades, it was one month in the wilderness. But there it was. The staff, one supposed, had to have their holiday. More important, there was some painting to be done and there was dry-rot in the roof. M., sitting in the bow window looking out over St James\u0027s Street, couldn\u0027t care less. He had two weeks\u0027 trout fishing on the Test to look forward to and, for the other two weeks, he would have sandwiches and coffee at his desk. He rarely used Blades, and then only to entertain important guests. He was not a \u0027clubable\u0027 man and if he had had the choice he would have stuck to The Senior, that greatest of all Services\u0027 clubs in the world. But too many people knew him there, and there was too much \u0027shop\u0027 talked. And there were too many former shipmates who would come up and ask him what he had been doing with himself since he retired. And the lie, \u0027Got a job with some people called Universal Export,\u0027 bored him, and though verifiable, had its risks. Porterfield hovered with the cigars. He bent and offered the wide case to M.\u0027s guest. Sir James Molony raised a quizzical eyebrow. \u0027I see the Havanas are still coming in.\u0027 His hand hesitated. He picked out a Romeo y Julieta, pinched it gently and ran it under his nose. He turned to M. \u0027What\u0027s Universal Export sending Castro in return? Blue Streak?\u0027 M. was not amused. Porterfield observed that he wasn\u0027t. As Chief Petty Officer, he had served under M. in one of his last commands. He said quickly, but not too quickly, \u0027As a matter of fact, Sir James, the best of the Jamaicans are quite up to the Havanas these days. They\u0027ve got the outer leaf just right at last.\u0027 He closed the glass lid of the case and moved away. Sir James Molony picked up the piercer the head waiter had left on the table and punctured the tip of his cigar with precision. He lit a Swan Vesta and waved its flame to and fro across the tip and sucked gently until he had got the cigar going to his satisfaction. Then he took a sip, first at his brandy and then at his coffee, and sat back. He observed the corrugated brow of his host with affection and irony. He said, \u0027All right, my friend. Now tell me. What\u0027s the problem?\u0027 M.\u0027s mind was elsewhere. He seemed to be having difficulty getting his pipe going. He said vaguely, between puffs, \u0027What problem?\u0027 Sir James Molony was the greatest neurologist in England. The year before, he had been awarded a Nobel Prize for his now famous Some Psychosomatic Side-effects of Organic Inferiority. He was also nerve specialist by appointment to the Secret Service and, though he was rarely called in, and then only in extremis, the problems he was required to solve intrigued him greatly because they were both human and vital to the State. And, since the war, the second qualification was a rare one. M. turned sideways to his guest and watched the traffic up St James\u0027s. Sir James Molony said, \u0027My friend, like everybody else, you have certain patterns of behaviour. One of them consists of occasionally asking me to lunch at Blades, stuffing me like a Strasbourg goose, and then letting me in on some ghastly secret and asking me to help you with it. The last time, as I recall, you wanted to find out if I could extract certain information from a foreign diplomat by getting him under deep hypnosis without his knowledge. You said it was a last resort. I said I couldn\u0027t help you. Two weeks later, I read in the paper that this same diplomat had come to a fatal end by experimenting with the force of gravity from a tenth floor window. The coroner gave an open verdict of the “Fell Or Was Pushed” variety. What song am I to sing for my supper this time?\u0027 Sir James Molony relented. He said with sympathy, \u0027Come on, M.! Get it off your chest!\u0027 M. looked him coldly in the eye. \u0027It\u0027s 007. I\u0027m getting more and more worried about him.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve read my two reports on his condition. Anything new?\u0027 \u0027No. Just the same. He\u0027s going slowly to pieces. Late at the office. Skimps his work. Makes mistakes. He\u0027s drinking too much and losing a lot of money at one of these new gambling clubs. It all adds up to the fact that one of my best men is on the edge of becoming a security risk. Absolutely incredible considering his record.\u0027 Sir James Molony shook his head with conviction. \u0027It\u0027s not in the least incredible. You either don\u0027t read my reports or you don\u0027t pay enough attention to them. I have said all along that the man is suffering from shock.\u0027 Sir James Molony leant forward and pointed his cigar at M.\u0027s chest. \u0027You\u0027re a hard man, M. In your job you have to be. But there are some problems, the human ones for instance, that you can\u0027t always solve with a rope\u0027s end. This is a case in point. Here\u0027s this agent of yours, just as tough and brave as I expect you were at his age. He\u0027s a bachelor and a confirmed womanizer. Then he suddenly falls in love, partly, I suspect, because this woman was a bird with a wing down and needed his help. It\u0027s surprising what soft centres these so-called tough men always have. So he marries her and within a few hours she\u0027s shot dead by this super-gangster chap. What was his name?\u0027 \u0027Blofeld,\u0027 said M. \u0027Ernst Stavro Blofeld.\u0027 \u0027All right. And your man got away with nothing worse than a crack on the head. But then he started going to pieces and your MO thought he might have suffered some brain injury and sent him along to me. Nothing wrong with him at all. Nothing physical that is - just shock. He admitted to me that all his zest had gone. That he wasn\u0027t interested in his job any more, or even in his life. I hear this sort of talk from patients every day. It\u0027s a form of psycho-neurosis, and it can grow slowly or suddenly. In your man\u0027s case, it was brought on out of the blue by an intolerable life-situation - or one that he found intolerable because he had never encountered it before -the loss of a loved one, aggravated in his case by the fact that he blamed himself for her death. Now, my friend, neither you nor I have had to carry such a burden, so we don\u0027t know how we would react under it. But I can tell you that it\u0027s a hell of a burden to lug around. And your man\u0027s caving in under it. I thought, and I said so in my report, that his job, its dangers and emergencies and so forth, would shake him out of it. I\u0027ve found that one must try and teach people that there\u0027s no top limit to disaster - that, so long as breath remains in your body, you\u0027ve got to accept the miseries of life. They will often seem infinite, insupportable. They are part of the human condition. Have you tried him on any tough assignments in the last few months?\u0027 \u0027Two,\u0027 said M. drearily. \u0027He bungled them both. On one he nearly got himself killed, and on the other he made a mistake that was dangerous for others. That\u0027s another thing that worries me. He didn\u0027t make mistakes before. Now suddenly he\u0027s become accident-prone.\u0027 \u0027Another symptom of his neurosis. So what are you going to do about it?\u0027 Tire him,\u0027 said M. brutally. \u0027Just as if he\u0027d been shot to pieces or got some incurable disease. I\u0027ve got no room in his Section for a lame-brain, whatever his past record or whatever excuses you psychologists can find for him. Pension, of course. Honourable discharge and all that. Try and find him a job. One of these new security organizations for the banks might take him.\u0027 M. looked defensively into the clear blue, comprehending eyes of the famous neurologist. He said, seeking support for his decision, \u0027You do see my point, Sir James? I\u0027m tightly staffed at Headquarters, and in the field, for that matter. There\u0027s just no place where I can tuck away 007 so that he won\u0027t cause harm.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/you-only-live-twice-james-bond-12/page-2.html","bookId":1554,"book":{"id":1554,"title":"You Only Live Twice (James Bond #12)","description":"Storyline: You Only Live Twice (James Bond (Original Series) #12) Bond, a shattered man after the death of his wife at the hands of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, has gone to pieces as an agent, endangering himself and his fellow operatives.
