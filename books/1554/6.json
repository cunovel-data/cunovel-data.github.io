{"id":108156,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Dikko Henderson made a wide gesture with his left hand. Bond decided that Dikko was getting cheerfully tight. He had found a Palomar pony to run with. They must be rare enough in Tokyo. They were both past the eighth flask of sake, but Dikko had also laid a foundation of Suntory whisky in the Okura while he\u0027d been waiting for Bond to write out an innocuous cable to Melbourne with the prefix \u0027Information-wise\u0027, which meant that it was for Mary Goodnight, to announce his arrival and give his current address. But it was all right with Bond that Dikko should be getting plastered. He would talk better and looser and, in the end, wiser that way. And Bond wanted to pick his brains.\n Bond said, \u0027But what sort of a chap is this Tanaka? Is he your enemy or your friend?\u0027\n \u0027Both. More of a friend probably. At least I\u0027d guess so. I amuse him. His CIA pals don\u0027t. He loosens up with me. We\u0027ve got things in common. We share a pleasure in the delights of samsara - wine and women. He\u0027s a great cocks-man. I also have ambitions in that direction. I\u0027ve managed to keep him out of two marriages. Trouble with Tiger is he always wants to marry \u0027em. He\u0027s paying cock-tax, that\u0027s alimony in the Australian vernacular, to three already. So he\u0027s acquired an ON with regard to me. That\u0027s an obligation - almost as important in the Japanese way of life as “face”. When you have an ON, you\u0027re not very, happy until you\u0027ve discharged it honourably, if you\u0027ll pardon the bad pun. And if a man makes you a present of a salmon, you mustn\u0027t repay him with a shrimp. It\u0027s got to be with an equally larg« salmon - larger if possible, so that then you\u0027ve jumped the man, and now he has an ON with regard to you, and you\u0027re quids in morally, socially and spiritually - and the last one\u0027s the most important. Well now. Tiger\u0027s ON towards me is a very powerful one, very difficult to discharge. He\u0027s paid little slices of it off with various intelligence dope. He\u0027s paid off another big slice by accepting your presence here and giving you an interview so soon after your arrival. If you\u0027d been an ordinary supplicant, -it might have taken you weeks. He\u0027d have given you a fat dose of shikiri-naoshi - that\u0027s making you wait, giving you the great stone face. The sumo wrestlers use it in the ring to make an opponent look and feel small in front of the audience. Got it? So you start with that in your favour. He would be predisposed to do what you want because that would remove all his ON towards me and, by his accounting, stick a whole packet of ON on my back towards him. But it\u0027s not so simple as that. All Japanese have permanent ON towards their superiors, the Emperor, their ancestors and the Japanese gods. This they can only discharge by doing “the right thing”. Not easy, you\u0027ll say. Because how can you know what the higher echelon thinks is the right thing? Well, you get out of that by doing what the bottom of the ladder thinks right - i.e. your immediate superiors. That passes the buck, psychologically, on to the , Emperor, and he\u0027s got to make his peace with ancestors and gods. But that\u0027s all right with him, because he embodies all the echelons above him, so he can get on with dissecting fish, which is his hobby, with a clear conscience. Got it? It\u0027s not really as mysterious as it sounds. Much the same routine as operates in big corporations, like ICI or Shell, or in the Services, except with them the ladder stops at the Board of Directors or the Chiefs of Staff. It\u0027s easier that way. You don\u0027t have to involve the Almighty and your great-grandfather in a decision to cut the price of aspirin by a penny a bottle.\u0027\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t sound very demokorasu to me.\u0027\n \u0027Of course it isn\u0027t, you dumb bastard. For God\u0027s sake, get it into your head that the Japanese are a separate human species. They\u0027ve only been operating as a civilized people, in the debased sense we talk about it in the West, for fifty, at the most a hundred years. Scratch a Russian and you\u0027ll find a Tartar. Scratch a Japanese and you\u0027ll find a samurai - or what he thinks is a samurai. Most of this samurai stuff is a myth, like the Wild West bunk the Americans are brought up on, or your knights in shining armour at King Arthur\u0027s court. Just because people play baseball and wear bowler hats doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re quote civilized unquote. Just to show you I\u0027m getting rather tight -not drunk, mark you-I\u0027d add that the UN are going to reap the father and mother of a whirlwind by quote liberating unquote the colonial peoples. Give \u0027em a thousand years, yes.\n But give \u0027em ten, no. You\u0027re only taking away their blowpipes and giving them machine guns. Just you wait for the first one to start crying to high heaven for nuclear fission. Because they must have quote parity unquote with the lousy colonial powers. I\u0027ll give you ten years for that to happen, my friend. And when it does, I\u0027ll dig myself a deep hole in the ground and sit in it.\u0027\n Bond laughed. \u0027That also doesn\u0027t sound very demokorasu?\n \u0027 “I fornicate upon thy demokorasu” as brother Hemingway would have said. I stand for government by an elite.\u0027 Dikko Henderson downed his ninth pint of sake. \u0027And voting graded by each individual\u0027s rating in that elite. And one tenth of a vote for my government if you don\u0027t agree with me!\u0027\n \u0027For God\u0027s sake, Dikko! Plow in hell did we get on to politics? Let\u0027s go and get some food. I\u0027ll agree there\u0027s a certain aboriginal common sense in what you say...\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t talk to me about the aborigines! What in hell do you think you know about the aborigines? Do you know that in my country there\u0027s a move afoot, not afoot, at full gallop, to give the aborigines the vote? You pommy poofter. You give me any more of that liberal crap and I\u0027ll have your balls for a bow-tie.\u0027\n Bond said mildly, \u0027What\u0027s a poofter?\u0027\n \u0027What you\u0027d call a pansy. No,\u0027 Dikko Henderson got to his feet and fired a string of what sounded like lucid Japanese at the man behind the bar, \u0027before I condemn you utterly, we\u0027ll go and eat eels-place where you can get a serious bottle of plonk to match. Then we\u0027ll go to “The House of Total Delight”. After that, I will give you my honest verdict, honestly come by.\u0027\n Bond said, \u0027You\u0027re a no-good kangaroo bum, Dikko. But I like eels. As long as they\u0027re not jellied. I\u0027ll pay for them and for the later relaxation. You pay for the rice wine and the plonk, whatever that is. Take it easy. The wingy at the bar has an appraising look.\u0027\n \u0027I come to appraise Mr Richard Lovelace Henderson, not to bury him.\u0027 Dikko Henderson produced a wad of thousand yen notes and began counting them out for the waiter. \u0027Not yet, that is.\u0027 He walked, with careful majesty, up to the bar and addressed himself to the large Negro in a plum-coloured coat behind it. \u0027Melody, be ashamed of yourself!\u0027 Then he led the way, with massive dignity, out of the bar.\n 5\n MAGIC 44\n DIKKO HENDERSON came to fetch Bond at ten o\u0027clock next morning. He was considerably overhung. The hard blue eyes were veined with blood and he made straight for the Bamboo Bar and ordered himself a double brandy and ginger ale. Bond said mildly, \u0027You shouldn\u0027t have poured all that sake on top of the Suntory. I can\u0027t believe Japanese whisky makes a good foundation for anything.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ve got something there, sport. I\u0027ve got myself a proper futsukayoi - honourable hangover. Mouth like a vulture\u0027s crutch. Soon as we got home from that lousy cat house, I had to go for the big spit. But you\u0027re wrong about Suntory. It\u0027s a good enough brew. Stick to the cheapest, the White Label, at around fifteen bob a bottle. There are two smarter brands, but the cheap one\u0027s the best. Went up to the distillery some whiles ago and met one of the family. Told me an interesting thing , about whisky. He said you can only make good whisky where you can take good photographs. Ever heard that one? Said it was something to do with the effect of clear light on the alcohol. But did I talk a lot of crap last night? Or did you? Seem to recollect that one of us did.\u0027\n \u0027You only gave me hell about the state of the world and called me a poofter. But you were quite friendly about it. No offence given or taken.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, Christ!\u0027 Dikko Henderson gloomily pushed a hand through his tough, grizzled hair. \u0027But I didn\u0027t hit anyone?\u0027\n \u0027Only that girl you slapped so hard on the bottom that she fell down.\u0027\n \u0027Oh that!\u0027 said Dikko Henderson with relief. \u0027That was just a love-pat. What\u0027s a girl\u0027s bottom for, anyway? And so far as I recall they all screamed with laughter. Including her. Right? How did you make out with yours by the way? She looked pretty enthusiastic.\u0027\n \u0027She was.\u0027\n \u0027Good show.\u0027 He swallowed the remains of his drink and got to his feet. \u0027Come on, bud. Let\u0027s go. Wouldn\u0027t do to keep Tiger waiting. I once did and he wouldn\u0027t speak to me for a week.\u0027\n It was a typical Tokyo day in late summer - hot, sticky and grey - the air full of fine dust from the endless demolition and reconstruction work. They drove for\u0027 half an hour towards Yokohama and pulled up outside a dull grey building which announced itself in large letters to be \u0027The Bureau of All-Asian Folkways\u0027. There was a busy traffic of Japanese scurrying in and out through the bogusly important-looking entrance, but no one glanced at Dikko and Bond, and they were not asked their business as Dikko led the way through an entrance hall where there were books and postcards on sale as if the place were some kind of museum. Dikko made for a doorway marked \u0027Coordination Department\u0027 and there was a long corridor with open rooms on both sides. The rooms were full of studious-looking young men at desks. There were large wall maps with coloured pins dotted across them, and endless shelves of books. A door marked \u0027International Relations\u0027 gave on to another corridor, this time lined with closed doors which had people\u0027s names on them in English and Japanese. A sharp right turn took them through the \u0027Visual Presentation Bureau\u0027 with more closed doors, and on to \u0027Documentation\u0027, a large hall-shaped library with more people bent over desks. Here, for the first time, they were scrutinized by a man at a desk near the entrance. He rose to his feet and bowed wordlessly. As they walked on Dikko said quietly, \u0027This is where the cover tapers off. Up till now, all those people really were researching Asian Folkways. But these here are part of Tiger\u0027s outside staff, doing more or less classified work. Sort of archivists. This is where we\u0027d be politely turned back if we\u0027d lost our way.\u0027 Behind a final wall of bookshelves that stretched out into the room a small door was concealed. It was marked \u0027Proposed Extension to Documentation Department. Danger! Construction work in progress\u0027. From behind it came the sound of drills, a circular saw cutting through the wood and other building noises. Dikko walked through the door into a totally empty room with a highly-polished wood floor. There was no sign of construction work. Dikko laughed at Bond\u0027s surprise. He gestured towards a large metal box fitted to the back of the door through which they had come. \u0027Tape recorder,\u0027 he said. \u0027Clever gimmick. Sounds just like the real thing. And this\u0027 - he pointed to the stretch of bare floor ahead - \u0027is what the Japanese call a “nightingale floor”. Relic of the old days when people wanted to be warned of intruders. Serves the same purpose here. Imagine trying to get across here without being heard.\u0027 They set off, and immediately the cunningly sprung boards gave out penetrating squeaks and groans. In a small facing door, a spy-hole slid open and one large eye surveyed them. The door opened to reveal a stocky man in plain clothes who had been sitting at a small deal table reading a book. It was a tiny box-like room that seemed to have no other exit. The man bowed. Dikko said some phrases containing the words \u0027Tanaka-san\u0027. The man bowed again. Dikko turned to Bond. \u0027You\u0027re on your own now. Be in it, champ! Tiger\u0027ll send you back to your hotel. See you.\u0027\n Bond said, \u0027Tell Mother I died game,\u0027 and walked into the little box and the door was closed behind him. There was a row of buttons by the desk and the guard pressed one of them. There came a barely perceptible whine and Bond got the impression of descent. So the room was a lift. What a box of tricks the formidable Tiger had erected as a screen for himself! The authentic Eastern nest of boxes. What next? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/you-only-live-twice-james-bond-12/page-6.html","bookId":1554,"book":{"id":1554,"title":"You Only Live Twice (James Bond #12)","description":"Storyline: \n You Only Live Twice (James Bond (Original Series) #12) \n Bond, a shattered man after the death of his wife at the hands of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, has gone to pieces as an agent, endangering himself and his fellow operatives.
