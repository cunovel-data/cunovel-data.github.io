Well the Black Dragons were a hundred times worse. To have them on your heels was certain death. They were totally ruthless, and not out of any particular political conviction. They operated strictly for cash.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, under this doctor from Switzerland, have they done any harm yet?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh no. They are nothing more than he says - personal staff, at the worst, if you like, a bodyguard. No. The trouble is quite different, much more complex. You see, this man Shatterhand has created what I can only describe as a garden of death.\u0027\\n\\n Bond raised his eyebrows. Really, for the head of a national secret service, Tiger\u0027s metaphors were almost ridiculously dramatic.\\n\\n Tiger exploded his golden smile. \u0027Bondo-san, I can see from your face that you think I am either drunk or mad. Now listen. This Doctor Shatterhand has filled this famous park of his uniquely with poisonous vegetation, the lakes and streams with poisonous fish, and he has infested the place with snakes, scorpions and poisonous spiders. He and this hideous wife of his are not harmed by these things, because whenever they leave the castle he wears full suits of armour of the seventeenth century, and she wears some other kind of protective clothing. His workers are not harmed because they wear rubber boots up to the knee, and maskos, that is, antiseptic gauze masks such as many people in Japan wear over the mouth and nose to avoid infection or the spreading of infection.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What a daft set-up.\u0027\\n\\n Tiger reached into the folds of the yukata he had changed into when they entered the house. He brought out several sheets of paper pinned together. He handed them over to Bond and said, \u0027Be patient. Do not judge what you do not understand. I know nothing of these poisonous plants. Nor, I expect, do you. Here is a list of those that have so far been planted by this doctor, together with comments by our Ministry of Agriculture. Read it. Take your time. You will be interested to learn what charming vegetation grows on the surface of the globe.\u0027\\n\\n Bond took the papers. The first page was a general note on vegetable poisons. There followed an annotated list. The papers bore the seal of the Ministry of Agriculture. This is what he read:\\n\\n The poisons listed fall into six main categories:\\n\\n 1. Deliriant. Symptoms: spectral illusions, delirium; dilated pupils; thirst and dryness; incoordination; then paralysis and spasms.\\n\\n 2. Inebriant. Symptoms: excitement of cerebral functions and of circulation; loss of coordination and muscular movements; double vision; then sleep and deep coma.\\n\\n 3. Convulsivant. Symptoms: intermittent spasms, from head downwards. Death from exhaustion, usually within three hours, or rapid recovery.\\n\\n 4. Depressant. Symptoms: vertigo, vomiting, abdominal pain, confused vision, convulsions, paralysis, fainting, sometimes asphyxia.\\n\\n 5. Asthenic. Symptoms: numbness, tingling mouth, abdominal pain, vertigo, vomiting, purging, delirium, paralysis, fainting.\\n\\n 6. Irritant.

America.\\n\\n Bond finished his reading. He handed the papers back. He said, \u0027Doctor Shatterhand\u0027s garden is indeed a lovesome thing, God wot.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you have of course heard of the South American piranha fish? They can strip a whole horse to the bones in less than an hour. The scientific name is Serrasalmus. The subspecies Nattered is the most voracious. Our good doctor has preferred these fish to our native goldfish for his lakes. You see what I mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027frankly I don\u0027t. What\u0027s the object of the good doctor\u0027s exercise?\u0027\\n\\n 8\\n\\n SLAY IT WITH FLOWERS\\n\\n IT WAS three o\u0027clock in the morning. The noise of the traffic to Yokohama had died. James Bond didn\u0027t feel tired. He was now totally absorbed in this extraordinary story of the Swiss doctor, who, as Tiger had originally said, \u0027collected death\u0027.\\n\\n Tiger wasn\u0027t telling him this bizarre case history for his entertainment. There was going to come a moment of climax. What would that climax be?\\n\\n Tiger wiped his hand over his face. He said, \u0027Did you read a story in the evening edition of the Asahi today? It concerned a suicide.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This was a young student aged eighteen who had failed his examination for the university for the second time. He lived in the suburbs of Tokyo. There was construction work on a new department, a department store, going on near where he lived. He went out of his room on to the site. A pile-driver was at work, sinking the foundations. Suddenly this youth broke through the surrounding workmen and, as the pile came crashing down, laid his head on the block beneath it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What a ghastly business! Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He had brought dishonour on his parents, his ancestors. This was his way of expiation. Suicide is a most, unfortunate aspect of the Japanese way of life.\u0027 Tiger paused. \u0027Or perhaps a most noble one. It depends how you look at it. That boy, and his family, will have gained great face in his neighbourhood.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t gain face from strawberry jam.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Think again, Bondo-san. Your posthumous VCs, for instance?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re not awarded for committing suicide after failing in an examination.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We are not so demokorasu as you are.\u0027 There was irony in Tiger\u0027s voice. \u0027Dishonour must be expunged - according to those of us who remain what you would describe as old-fashioned. There is no apology more sincere than the offering up of your own life. It is literally all you have to give.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But even if this boy failed for the university, he could have gone for a lower standard of examination, for a lower grade of college. As you know, we say ‚ÄúBlast!‚Äù or perhaps a stronger word if we fail an examination in Britain. But we readjust our sights, or our parents do it for us, and have another bash. We don\u0027t kill ourselves. It wouldn\u0027t occur to us. It would be dishonourable rather than honourable. It would be cowardly - a refusal to stand up to reverses, to life. And it would give great pain to our parents, and certainly no satisfaction to our ancestors.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027With us it is different. And despite demokorasu, the parents of this youth will be rejoicing this evening and their neighbours will be rejoicing with them. Honour is more important to us than life - more proud, more beautiful.\u0027\\n\\n Bond shrugged. \u0027Well, I just think that if the boy had the guts to do this thing, it was the waste of a perfectly good Japanese life. In fact, of course, this suicide business in Japan is nothing more than a form of hysteria-an expression of the streak of violence that seems to run all through the history of Japan. If you hold your own life so cheaply, it follows that you will hold others\u0027 lives even more cheaply. The other day, I saw a traffic accident at one of the main crossings. I don\u0027t know the name of it. It was a multiple affair, and there were bodies all over the place. The police came, but instead of concentrating on getting the wounded to hospital, insisted that they should lie where they were so that they could draw chalk lines round them and photograph them - presumably for use when the case came to court.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/you-only-live-twice-james-bond-12/page-10.html","bookId":1554,"book":{"id":1554,"title":"You Only Live Twice (James Bond #12)","description":"Storyline: You Only Live Twice (James Bond (Original Series) #12) \\n Bond, a shattered man after the death of his wife at the hands of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, has gone to pieces as an agent, endangering himself and his fellow operatives.
