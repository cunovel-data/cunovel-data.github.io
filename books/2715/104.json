Or did you lie about that?”\n “No, I really did. I just…” Emotional tears filled her eyes as she set her hand against her chest. “I can’t believe you got me a present.”\n I frowned, confused. “Why wouldn’t I? It was my girlfriend’s birthday.”\n That was one of the things that had upset me most about her absence. I hadn’t been able to see her on her big day. As I swore to myself I’d be present for the next and all the ones after that, she said, “I don’t know. I just wasn’t expecting… You really didn’t have to. Just getting to see you is the best present ever.”\n I shrugged, strangely bashful. “Don’t get too worked up. It’s not much. Seriously. I wish I could’ve gotten you something better, or more, but…” I sent her a wince. We both knew I couldn’t afford better or more.\n Deep affection filled her gaze. “I have a feeling it’ll be my favorite gift, anyway.” Grabbing it, she tore off the paper.\n I drew in a sharp breath, wanting to warn her not to get her hopes up. Shit, I should’ve splurged a little more, gotten some jewelry or—\n “Oh my God!” Throwing her head back, she laughed as she hugged the book to her chest. “I love it.”\n I sighed and batted shredded paper out of my way. “It’s cheesy.”\n “That’s why it’s perfect.” After pulling The World’s Greatest Collection of Clean Jokes away from her so she could grin at the cover, she wiggled her eyebrows my way. “I can’t wait to lay some of these jokes on you the next time I see you.”\n Neither could I. It was one of the things I looked forward to most. Because it meant more time with her.\n “And there’s more?” City went on incredulously as she set the book aside to tug tissue paper from the box so she could see the slippers at the bottom.\n “Told you I’d get you a new pair.”\n “They’re so cute.” She ripped off her sandals and fit the ballet flats on. “And they fit.” She held out her foot to show me.\n I took her ankle and slid my palm up her smooth, golden calf. “Beautiful.” When I looked at her, we shared one of those smiles where you just look at a person and are filled with happiness.\n Content and so glad she was back, I stroked a little higher up her calf. “I was this close to getting you something practical you should actually wear through the woods, but then I thought that wasn’t my City at all.”\n She shrugged. “I would’ve worn any shoe you gave me.”\n I leaned in and pressed my lips to the inside of her knee. Eyes lighting, she scooted toward me, and I knew she was seeking a kiss on the mouth, but I only smiled and popped to my feet before holding a hand down to her. “Ready to see the last part?”\n “Last part?” Confusion reigned on her face as she took my hand. “What’re you talking about? There can’t be...more?”\n “This present didn’t cost me anything, but I thought…” I shrugged. “Maybe you’d like it.”\n “Well, where is it?” Glancing around, she showed off all her curious eagerness as she bounced on the toes of her new shoes.\n “It’s at our tree.” Turning to offer her another ride on my back, I said, “Climb on. I don’t want you to ruin your new shoes their first trip out.”\n “Knox…you don’t have to do that.”\n I winked at her. “Trust me, I have an ulterior motive.”\n “Oh, yeah? What’s that?” Eyeing me warily, she climbed on.\n Once she was in position, I reached back to grip her thighs and keep her secure to me. Then I glanced over my shoulder to grin at her. “So I can feel your legs wrapped around me and your boobs against my back.”\n “You mean, like this.” She slid up my back, purposely smashing her chest to my shoulder blades.\n I groaned and slid my hand higher up her thighs. “Exactly like that.”\n “Just think,” she murmured in my ear before pressing her mouth to the side of my neck. “If you weren’t so noble, you could probably have me naked by now.”\n “Don’t worry, I still plan on getting you there. Eventually.”\n “But I’m wet right now.” Her tongue slid around the shell of my ear and I almost lost it.\n “Damn, City. You definitely know how to get me going.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-104.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: \n I fell in love once. \n It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. \n I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. \n Our love could conquer all. \n Until it didn\u0027t. \n So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. \n It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. \n Or so I thought. \n Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before.
