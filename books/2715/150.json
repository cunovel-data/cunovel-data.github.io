I’m sure mine wasn’t the only one who...” I couldn’t finish the sentence, so I swallowed hard. “You’re right. It might just be a coincidence. We might not have the same mother. But I found a way to get the truth, once and for all.” I shook my head. “What’re you talking about?” My gaze landed on the envelope in his hand. “What is that?” But I pretty much already knew. He tapped it against his palm slowly. “It’s DNA test results, matching a piece of my hair to a piece I stole from you.” My legs turned to Jell-O. “Oh, shit,” I mumbled, blindly finding my way to his couch and plopping down. “So it was a match? We’re really...?” I glanced up at him, and his brown eyes held so much compassion and understanding that I almost lost it. “I don’t know,” he said. “I haven’t opened it yet. I thought the two of us should open it together.” “Right now?” I wiped my hands over my face, still afraid of the answer. Not sure what it’d mean for us, no matter what the results were. “When else?” He watched me as he opened one end. I almost blurted out for him to wait. I wasn’t ready.

And it was too late to stall anything.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-150.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: I fell in love once. It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. Our love could conquer all. Until it didn\u0027t. So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. Or so I thought. Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I\u0027m older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless ex-con like me. So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away. Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway. This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper... --Knox Parker","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}}
