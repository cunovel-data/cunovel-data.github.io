But Knox took my hand and knelt on the dock with me. Then he spread out my dress so I could lie on it. At the last second, he ripped off his shirt to provide my head with extra pillowing. Then he motioned for me to get into place.\n I was shaky and nervous, and he could tell as he stared down at me. Taking my balled hands, he kissed them until I relaxed and opened them. “We don’t have to do it if you don’t want to, but I really want to make you feel good, City.”\n “Don’t stop. I want that too,” I assured him. It was just...well, I was freaking naked in front of a boy. And he was about to explore...down there. Everything inside me was going haywire.”\n “Okay,” he whispered, pressing his mouth to my palm. “But you tell me at any time if you want to stop, and I will.”\n I bobbed my head. “All right.”\n He finally looked at me, completely from head to toe, laid out nude on the dock while he knelt beside me.\n “Fuck, City, you look good naked in the moonlight. You’re...perfect.”\n “I love you,” I said in a high, scared voice.\n His grin was immediate and warm. “I love you, too.” Then he leaned down and kissed me, sweetly and closed-mouthed, on the lips.\n This, I could do. So I kissed him back and cupped his face, running my fingers up into his hair. He eased down beside me so we were stretched out next to each other on our sides, and as he deepened the kiss, his hand smoothed over my cheek and down my neck until he reached my breasts. After flicking his thumb over the nipple, he cupped me hard, making a jolt of pain mix with even more pleasure.\n I panted into his mouth and kissed him deeper. He groaned and moved his hand south, over my stomach and across to my hip. He cupped that a second before caressing his way to the apex of my thighs. Right before he reached the place that was sensitive, pulsing, and swollen, he paused. Then he pressed his forehead to mine, looked into my eyes, and touched me.\n I sucked in a breath at the shock of it.\n “Is it okay?” he asked, his gaze worried.\n I gulped, not quite sure I could talk yet. Then I nodded, and blubbered, “Better...so much better than okay.”\n Male satisfaction clouded his features, and he moved lower, until—\n “Oh, fuck me. You’re wet. You’re so fucking wet.”\n His finger plunged into me and I bucked against it. “Knox. God, that feels...” I clutched his shoulder hard and savored the feeling. “So...good.”\n “Does it?” He stroked me then, drawing his finger out and then pushing it back in. I loved it and thrust up my hips to meet his next plunge. “God, you’re gorgeous. You’re so gorgeous.”\n I bit my lip, watching him as he watched me back.\n “Jesus, City,” he rasped. “You’re killing me here. You’re not supposed to look this hot getting off to my hand. I’m barely holding myself together.”\n Too seeped in the pleasure to care, I arched my back and begged, “More.”\n He gave it, kissing me hard, tangling our tongues together as he added another finger and cupping one of my breasts with a free hand. I crashed my hips against his palm in feminine demand, and he moved faster, thrust deeper.\n “Oh my God.” I pulled away from his kiss to arch my neck back and bow up my aching breasts. “Something’s happening. I think I’m gonna come.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-96.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: \n I fell in love once. \n It was amazing. She was amazing.
