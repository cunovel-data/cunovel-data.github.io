Please tell me there’s at least some experimental kissing. Or boob touching to compare sizes. Trying on each other’s panties?”\\n\\n “Eww.” I sent him a glare, but he only laughed.\\n\\n “Oh, come on. You gotta give me something. There has to be at least one indecent thing that actually happens at slumber parties, or there’s no hope left in the world.”\\n\\n I opened my mouth to call him a pig when a knock on my door made me yelp.\\n\\n “Felicity?” It was Max this time. The good brother.\\n\\n He sounded concerned.\\n\\n Slicing a worried glance at Knox, I called back, “Y-yeah?”\\n\\n “Sweetie, I don’t want to worry you, but someone broke into the house again. We’re not sure if he’s gone yet. So I’m going to stay in your room until you get out, just to be on the safe side. But Father’s already called the sheriff, who should be here soon, so don’t be scared, okay?”\\n\\n I gulped and looked up at Knox, who’d gone pale. “Oh, shit,” he mouthed.\\n\\n “Umm...actually, I didn’t bring any clothes into the bathroom with me,” I told Max, biting my lip and praying he bought that.\\n\\n “Do you want me to bring some to your door?” Max so considerately offered.\\n\\n I slumped my shoulders and met Knox’s gaze. His brown eyes swirled with worry.\\n\\n “No. No, just...can you wait outside my bedroom door? I’m not sure what I want to wear yet.”\\n\\n He hesitated. I was positive he’d tell me no, but then he finally said, “All right, but hurry, okay? Father wants us all downstairs in the sitting room so we can be in one place.”\\n\\n “Of course. I’ll be out in a second.”\\n\\n I closed my eyes and held my breath until I heard his footsteps move across my room and then my bedroom door close.\\n\\n Exhaling silently, I slipped out of the bathroom as quietly as possible, even though I had no idea why I was being quiet about that.\\n\\n I tiptoed into my bedroom, and immediately I missed the close intimacy I’d shared with Knox.\\n\\n Seeing that the coast was clear, I opened the door fully to set him free. He stepped into my bedroom, very pale.\\n\\n “Now what?” he whispered, scowling. “He’s still right outside the door.”\\n\\n Oh, right. Crap. Why hadn’t I thought that far ahead?\\n\\n I winced. “Window?”\\n\\n He glanced over, and his face turned a sick green. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”\\n\\n “There’s a trellis,” I offered hopefully.\\n\\n He turned back to me. “I hate heights.”\\n\\n I gulped. “Oh.”\\n\\n This could be bad.\\n\\n But he didn’t seem to stress out about his acrophobia. He just drew in a breath and approached the window slowly, studying it like a determined man on a mission...about to face his doom. After he opened the window and stuck his head out to calculate the drop, he jerked back inside and began to breathe hard.\\n\\n When he glanced back at me, his eyes were wild with panic. I brought my balled hands to my mouth, beyond worried. I so did not want to make him face his fear. “Maybe you can wait in my bathroom until late, and we’ll sneak you out after everyone’s gone to bed.”\\n\\n He gave a vigorous shake to his head. “If the cops are coming, they’ll want to check every room before they leave. Don’t you think?”\\n\\n I gave a weak shrug, not sure what would happen.\\n\\n He shook his head again. “No, I can do this. The trellis looks sturdy.”\\n\\n Looks? What a not-very-reassuring word.\\n\\n I watched, biting my fingernail to the quick as he climbed out the window feet first. When the upper part of his body was still inside but his waist down was out of sight, he glanced at me. I sent him a tremulous thumbs-up, and he flashed me a brave smile before stepping down, and then disappearing from view.\\n\\n I raced to the window and poked my head out, only to find him still right outside my window, clinging to the trellis and cursing under his breath as he squeezed his eyes closed.\\n\\n “Hey,” I called. “What did the mute say to the midget?”\\n\\n He looked up, blinking rapidly. “What?”\\n\\n I smiled. “Oh, good. I have your attention. Now...just keep looking into my eyes, and then take one more step down.”\\n\\n His head slashed back and forth. “I can’t do this.”\\n\\n “Knox,” I said sternly. “One step. That’s all. Now do it.”\\n\\n Agony filled his eyes, but he filled his cheeks with air and took one step down. Once he had his footing secured, he blew out the breath. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-12.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: I fell in love once. \\n It was amazing.
