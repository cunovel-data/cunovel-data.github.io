When I just watched her, she threw her hands into the air. “Oh my God, why didn’t you say something before?”\n I ushered her the rest of the way inside, and once we were both in, I shut the door at my back. “I didn’t know what to say. He was...different.”\n “Different?” she repeated, frowning.\n “He wasn’t at all concerned about catching up on old times. He seemed more obsessed about some vendetta he has against the Bainbridge family.”\n “The...” She shook her head. “Excuse me?”\n “He tried to recruit me into his cause. Said they all needed to pay for what they did to Mercy. What they did to me. For how they burned down our house.” When her eyebrows lifted at that, I had to ask, “Was that fire arson?”\n “I...I...” she sputtered, before shaking her head. “There were rumors, of course. People came and questioned all of us, but...no, I don’t…I don’t think they ever decided it was arson.” Concern filled her eyes. “Why? Do you think one of the Bainbridges did it? That they killed half your family? Bentley?”\n I studied her a second before shaking my head. “No,” I said. “I think an eighteen-year-old boy filled with too much hate was making up reasons to justify his resentment.”\n Her shoulders fell, revealing her relief. But then a new hint of caution filled her gaze. “And you’re not filled with that same hatred?”\n If I’d never met her in the woods and spent an entire summer learning what love was, I might’ve been a lot more hostile. I might’ve been filled with more hate than Rocket was. But there were so many better things to hold on to than animosity. The part of me that clung to the love we’d once shared would never let me stoop to Rocket’s bitter level.\n “No,” was all I could tell her. There was dark shit in me, but I wasn’t filled with hatred.\n She sent me a small smile and nodded. “Good.” When she turned toward her room, I said, “You need to stay away from him.”\n She glanced back at me as if I’d lost my mind. “Excuse me?”\n “I didn’t like the way he glared at you. He thinks you’re one of them, and he’d probably have no qualms about seeking his misplaced sense of justice by going after you.”\n Shaking her head, she said, “What’re you saying? You think he’s the person leaving the ‘death threats’ on my locker?”\n “I don’t know. But I’m going to find out.”\n An impasse seemed to sprout between Knox and me the night following his encounter with his brother. I stopped pressing him for more and he stopped pushing me away. But there was still a distance between us I couldn’t stand.\n He was gone Saturday morning when I woke, probably working out at the gym he’d yet to tell me he frequented. But he’d brewed my coffee, and it was waiting in its carafe for me when I stumbled into the kitchen. I tried not to let that affect me, but I was still touched by his thoughtfulness.\n The rest of the day, I hung out in my room, only coming out when I heard him leave the kitchen or bathroom, and he seemed to do the same. The living room had become a no man’s land where neither of us spent any time.\n It was pretty depressing, and I wondered how long we could keep this up. It didn’t feel as if it could last forever. In fact, the entire day felt like the calm before a storm.\n I just had no idea the storm would come in the form of a perky brunette named Reese. She called early Sunday morning.\n “Hey, I was just curious if you and Knox could come a little earlier to lunch today?”\n Sitting up in bed and yawning as I scratched my scalp, I tried to wake my brain enough to figure out what the heck Mason’s girlfriend was talking about. I’d only spoken to her a handful of times when she’d visited the club. I couldn’t figure out why she was calling me or even why she was talking about me and Knox together. So I finally just said, “What lunch?”\n “Oh!” She let out an embarrassed sound. “Sorry, did he not tell you about the invite? Such a guy. I should’ve called you Thursday and followed up on the details. Anyway, everyone is invited to our place today for some good eats. But I was hoping you two could come just a wee bit earlier. I have some...information for him.”\n I frowned, really confused and twice as curious. “You know Knox?”\n “Uh...no. We’ve never met. But...still. I’d really like to meet him today.”\n “Well...” I looked around my room, trying to wake up fully. “Okay. I guess. What time did you want us there?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-127.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: \n I fell in love once. \n It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. \n I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. \n Our love could conquer all. \n Until it didn\u0027t. \n So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. \n It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. \n Or so I thought. \n Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I\u0027m older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless ex-con like me. \n So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away. \n Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway. \n This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper... \n --Knox Parker\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}}
