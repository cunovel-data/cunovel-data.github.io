Noel blew out a breath. “Honestly, I don’t know what to make of the guy at all, and that makes me suspicious as fuck, so I’m going with...keep a safe distance from him. I’m talking about you when I say that.” When he pointed at me, I narrowed my eyes. “I’m serious, Felicity. You said yourself he’s different now. Don’t go thinking he’s the same boy you once knew and get yourself in trouble.” I wasn’t even sure how to answer that. My first instinct was to say Knox would never hurt me. But I let some of the doubt creep in. Because Noel was watching me so hard, I nodded to let him know I’d heard his warning, but I wasn’t sure yet if I was actually going to heed it. When Noel’s cell phone rang from the counter, I was relieved for the reprieve. I wanted to think about this before deciding what I was going to do next. “Yep, okay. Will do.” Noel hung up and turned to me. “That was Pick. He wants to see you in his office as soon as possible. And oh, he said to get your damn cell phone charged.” “Oh, right.” I’d forgotten I had my charger back now, since Noel had taken me to Cam’s house the day before to pack my things the new girlfriend hadn’t stolen or destroyed. Ugh, had that only been yesterday? I’d been too distracted by what had happened last night with Knox to even think about how I was down to half my possessions now. It was really too much to take in. How was a girl supposed to think properly with so much going on? “Okay.” I slumped from my chair, glancing at the newspaper sitting on the table and remembering I had to keep searching for a new place to live, too. Oh, and I had to think up a way to repay the Gambles for the car tire they’d gotten fixed for me. Five minutes later, I’d coaxed my temperamental car into deciding it wanted to work after all, and ten minutes after that I was pulling into a parking spot in the lot across the street from Forbidden. The place was deserted since it wouldn’t open for hours to come. Using my key, I let myself in and strolled through the quiet club to the hall that led to Pick’s office. His door was open, so I knocked as I went in. “Ooh, I like the new desk.” It was a lot more modern looking than the heavy oak one he’d had before, and his computer was now a laptop instead of a desktop. He shut the laptop he’d been typing on, and sent me a tight smile. “Tink picked it out. I’m still trying to get used to it.” “So what’s up?” I seated myself on his couch and relaxed on the plush leather cushions. Stretching his hands over his head, he popped his neck from one side to the other. “We’ll get to that in a second. We’re still waiting for one more person to show up. How’ve you been holding up?” “Oh…” I wasn’t too sure about that answer, so I shrugged. “Noel helped me move my things from Cam’s place yesterday, so I have…some of my stuff back, all that I’m ever going to get back, anyway. And I look for rentals every morning in the paper, but I haven’t found anything even remotely acceptable in my price range.” He nodded, folding his hands together and resting them on the desk. “And everything else?” With a sigh, I shook my head. “Ask me again in a month and maybe I’ll have an answer for you.” Not wanting to talk about Knox right now, I asked, “Who’re we waiting for anyway, and what exactly is this about?” That’s when Knox appeared in the opened doorway. He stopped short when he saw me. “Oh, God.” Popping to my feet, I gaped back in horror. Then I whirled to Pick. “Is this about last night?” Pick lifted his eyebrows. “What happened last night?” “Nothing,” I was quick to mutter, glad Ten wasn’t as big a gossip as I thought he was. After a quick, uncertain glance Knox’s way, I returned my attention to Pick and cleared my throat. “Why would you want to see the two of us together?” Waving Knox the rest of the way into the room, Pick said, “Take a seat.” Knox moved about two feet into the room and planted himself, not bothering to sit. So I folded my arms over my chest, remaining on my feet as well. Pick sighed. “All right then. I wanted to let you know I found an apartment for you.” My eyes widened and elation bloomed inside me. “That’s great!” I’d been searching everywhere and hadn’t found squat. Then I noticed Knox had a slight, confused scowl on his face, and it hit me that he’d been staying with Pick and also needed a place to live. “Wait.” I turned back to Pick. “Which…one of us are you talking to?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-101.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: I fell in love once. It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. Our love could conquer all. Until it didn\u0027t. So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. Or so I thought. Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I\u0027m older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless ex-con like me. So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away. Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway. This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper... --Knox Parker","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}}
