It’s your turn.”\n I could tell by his expression that he wanted to argue with me, but the urge to pump took over, and he pulled out before pushing back in. This time didn’t hurt at all, but it still felt…funny. Knox groaned and buried his face in my neck. “Oh...shit. You feel so good.”\n I stroked the back of his hair and down his back. “I love touching your bare back. Have I ever told you how much I love touching you here…?” I ran my fingers over the back of him before sliding them over his taut buttocks and clutching him hard in my palms. “And here.”\n “I love you, period.” He lifted his face to kiss me and began to thrust with more purpose. My inner muscles seemed to adjust to the repeated invasion, and the stretching actually became…nice, until—I sucked in a breath when he hit a spot that felt a lot better than nice.\n “Oh. Do that again.”\n “What? This?” He did it, with a little more intensity. I arched under him and moaned. He kissed me deeper. The moment our tongues mated, he slid a hand down and caught my clit between his fingers. The shock made me come.\n Knox grunted, gripped my hair and followed me into the storm.\n We held each other, kissing through it and then breathing against each other’s necks when we needed air. Once he stilled inside me, and my body was done quaking, he brushed damp hair out of my face and kissed my cheek.\n I grinned up at him and whispered, “Home run, baby.”\n He laughed and pressed his forehead to my shoulder. “I can’t believe we just did that.”\n “Me neither.” I stroked his damp skin and kissed the side of his head, then his temple. His cheek. “But it was pretty cool, wasn’t it?\n “If by cool, you mean the most amazing thing ever, then sure.” He looked up at me. “Are you okay?”\n I snorted. “If by okay, you mean absolutely wonderful, then sure.”\n Chuckling at my answer, he pulled out of me and began to sit up. “I’m probably squishing you.”\n I wanted to tell him he was fine, I liked him right where he was. But okay, I did feel a bit squished. I sat up beside him, thinking I should feel embarrassed that we were sitting naked together side by side in the backseat of my new car, but I didn’t even experience a smidgeon of awkward shame.\n Looking down at his lap, he made a strange sound in his throat. “Okay, my first used condom. What the hell do I do with this thing?”\n “Umm…throw it out the window?”\n He went to pull it off as I stood up and leaned over the front seat to turn the car onto accessory and roll down the back window for him.\n “Shit,” he hissed. “There’s blood on it. Are sure you’re okay?”\n I plopped back down beside him, rolling my eyes. “It was my first time; there was supposed to be blood.”\n “I know, but...I’m actually looking at the fucking blood now, and it’s...do you still hurt? How bad did it hurt? Don’t lie to me. Because if you’re not okay—”\n “Knox.” I clasped his face in both hands and smiled into his eyes. “I am more than okay. I’m wonderful. And, no, it doesn’t hurt at all.”\n “But it did?” he pressed, worry creasing his features.\n I squinted thoughtfully and admitted, “For like half a second maybe, but then it felt so good, the little pinch of pain at first was worth it.”\n “Truth?”\n “Truth,” I assured.\n He kissed me once, and then flung the used condom out the window so he could grasp my face and kiss me deeper. “Thank you,” he said, pulling me into his lap. “Thank you for the best summer of my entire life. I look forward to sharing twenty more with you, and then twenty more after that.”\n “What about winter, and fall and spring?”\n “Those too. I can’t wait to spend every season with you.”\n He leaned in to kiss me again, but a light filled the backseat.\n I blinked against the sudden brightness. “What—”\n “Shit, shit, shit.” He shoved me off his legs. “A car’s coming!”\n “Oh my God!” Totally not expecting that, I dove off him the rest of the way, covering my chest as I went.\n “Clothes. Now,” he ordered, finding his boxers first thing and yanking them on.\n “I can’t find anything,” I wailed, my panic making my head even more blurry and unable to find a single piece of my outfit. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-114.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: \n I fell in love once. \n It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. \n I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. \n Our love could conquer all. \n Until it didn\u0027t. \n So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. \n It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. \n Or so I thought. \n Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I\u0027m older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless ex-con like me. \n So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away. \n Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway. \n This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper... \n --Knox Parker\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}}
