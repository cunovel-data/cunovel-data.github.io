And here we are. The trouble tree.”\n “The trouble tree?”\n As I leaned my back against it and slid down to the root base with her in my lap, I nodded. “Yep. It seems to be the tree where we come to shed all our troubles.”\n Her smile was soft. “I like that.”\n I nuzzled my nose to hers. “I figured you might. Now, talk, little girl. Or I’ll tickle it out of you.”\n She sighed and rested her head on my shoulder. “I won’t be able to make it out here tomorrow. It’s the big cotillion day.”\n I stroked her hair and wound a coiled lock around my finger. “Yeah, I’ve seen flyers for that. I thought it was in the evening, though, when I’ll be working.”\n “It is, but Mom is having a photographer come over to take my picture in our gazebo at noon. I have to get into my dress and put on my makeup and everything for it.” She made a face, but I smiled.\n “I bet you’ll look beautiful.”\n She rolled her eyes. “I always feel like a poodle at a dog show whenever the cotillion rolls around. It’s the only time my mother really pays attention to me.”\n “And this is what has you worried?” I asked, not buying it.\n She sighed. “No. But I was hoping it would divert your attention enough to forget about it.”\n “I won’t ever stop worrying about what’s bugging you until I know you’re better.”\n “But it’s really—”\n “Stupid. I know. Now lay it on me.”\n “Fine. My father’s lawyer came to lunch today.”\n “Okay,” I pressed.\n “And he brought his family with him, including his...son.”\n “Tad?” I’d heard her talk about how her father’s lawyer’s son was her brother Garrett’s best friend, and how they were nearly inseparable.\n “No, the other son,” she whispered. “The younger one. Jeremy. He’s my age, but since they live up north, they go to Ellamore, not Southside with us.”\n I nodded, ready to murder this Jeremy guy for whatever he’d done. “And?”\n “And nothing.” She groaned and flopped her head onto my shoulder. “That’s why it’s so stupid. He didn’t do anything, he’s just always given me the heebie jeebie creeps. My skin crawls every time he looks at me. And today—”\n When she broke off so suddenly, I gripped her waist. “Today?”\n “He just...” She winced and shook her head. “He said something that disturbed me.”\n “What did he say?” I nearly yelled.\n She jumped and gaped at me. “It wasn’t that awful, don’t worry. I’m sorry, Knox. I didn’t mean to worry you.”\n I growled out a sound and waved her apology aside. “Just tell me what he said, and I’ll judge for myself if I should worry.”\n “Okay, fine. He told me I looked good today, like better than usual, that there was a certain glow about me. Then he asked me if I’d finally lost my virginity.”\n “He said what?” I grew rigid with outrage, ready to kick Jeremy the lawyer’s son’s ass.\n “But it was more like, ‘Finally got your cherry popped, huh?’ And he leaned in really close with one of those oily, cocky grins. It just...” She shuddered in my arms. “It skeeved me out.”\n “And it should. That was a totally inappropriate question. Who the hell is this guy?”\n “I told you. He’s my father’s lawyer’s—”\n “Yeah, I got that part. Don’t ever get stuck alone with that creep.”\n “Oh, trust me. I make sure I don’t. And today, I think he actually tried to get me alone. But I kept escaping him. I just have this feeling he’d try something if he ever did corner me...and he wouldn’t care if I was willing or not.”\n “Then there’s probably a good reason you feel that way.” I pulled her in close and kissed her hair.\n “So you don’t think I’m being paranoid and overreacting.”\n “Hell, no. Trust your instincts, always. Sometimes they know more than your brain does.”\n She sighed suddenly and went totally lax against me. “This is why I love coming to you. You always make me feel better.”\n “That’s my job.” I pressed my mouth to her temple. “Boyfriend Duty number one.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-77.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: \n I fell in love once. \n It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. \n I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. \n Our love could conquer all. \n Until it didn\u0027t. \n So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. \n It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. \n Or so I thought. \n Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I\u0027m older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless ex-con like me. \n So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away. \n Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway. \n This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper... \n --Knox Parker\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}}
