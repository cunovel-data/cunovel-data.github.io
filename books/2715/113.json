He only grinned before taking off his shirt. Then he leaned forward and kissed me…between the legs. I bowed up my back and clutched handfuls of his hair. His tongue swirled fast and my body grew rigid, seeking relief while it savored the mounting compression. I gasped his name, and he must’ve known how close I was because he thrust two fingers into me. Almost immediately, I screamed out my release. When I finally came down, he was sitting up and tugging his pants down his thighs. “God, you’re amazing,” he murmured as he found my discarded shorts and fished out the condom. But as soon as he had it in his hand, he paused. “You sure about this?” He held it up and shook his head. “We can still wait. I’m okay with waiting.” “Put it on,” I said, opening my legs and touching myself. “I need more.” He sucked in a breath. “Fuck, City. That’s so hot.” “I remember you saying how much you wished you could’ve seen me do this to myself.” I whimpered and arched my back when I hit a spot that actually felt good. “You are hands down the best girlfriend ever. I so do not deserve you.” His fingers shook as he opened the package and carefully eased the condom on. Once he was suited up, he turned to me. “We can stop at any time, baby. Don’t ever forget that.” I nodded. “Okay. Why are you shaking so much?” Even his laugh trembled as he moved above me. “Because I’m nervous as fuck. I want to make this amazing for you, and I really have no idea what I’m doing.” Once he’d settled his hips between my legs and was supporting the top half of himself over my body with his arms, I touched his cheek. “Do you think it’ll be good for you?” He snorted. “Oh, there’s no doubt about that.” “Then it’ll be good for me.” After blowing out a breath and nodding, he sent me a grateful smile. “And here I was so sure I’d have to be the one to talk you through this and calm you down.” “You’re doing great,” I offered, playing along. He shook his head and grinned. “Shut up, smart-ass.” Then he pressed the head of his cock against my entrance. We both sucked in a breath. “Okay, now I’m nervous,” I said. “I’ll stop.” He immediately began to pull away. “No!” I clutched him back to me. “Just…could you go slow? Really, really, really slow. Like snail slow. Please.” He huffed out a breath and pressed his brow to mine. “That was already part of the plan.” “All right, okay. Good. I’m ready then.” I drew in a bolstering breath, but he merely watched me before taking a small piece of my hair and winding it around his finger. “You know, that first day in the woods, I never in a million years would’ve thought we’d end up here. You have no idea how privileged I feel to get to be with you.” A blinding love filled my chest. Touching his cheek, I whispered, “I feel the same exact way.” He kept gazing at me as he began to press inside me. The unfamiliar stretching made me grip his arm. His eyes were wide as he paused and whispered, “Wow.” Then his brow crinkled with concern. “How’re you doing?” I nodded. “Good.” Even though I wasn’t that sure at all. I kind of wanted to back out of it altogether, but I couldn’t tell him that after I’d spent so much effort talking him into it. He was going slow, though, just like I’d asked, so I appreciated that. He gave me all the time in the world to adjust to him. It took a toll on him, though. Sweat beaded on his brow, strain made his face redden, and his arms were beginning to tremble. “I love you,” I told him. “Love you too.” He slid deeper and broke through some barrier that made me flinch. He froze solid. “City?” “I’m good. I’m okay. Don’t stop.” Seated deep in me, he shook his head. “I don’t know if I can move right now. I’m so close I’m afraid I’ll go off as soon as I do.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-113.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: I fell in love once. It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. Our love could conquer all. Until it didn\u0027t. So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. Or so I thought. Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I\u0027m older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless ex-con like me. So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away. Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway. This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper... --Knox Parker","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}}
