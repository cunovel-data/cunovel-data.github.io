Turns out, Pick actually knew the guy from school, and get this, he’s some kind of fucking ex-con who just got out of prison today.”\n My mind instantly traveled to the only person I’d ever really known who’d done any time. And Pick would’ve known him too. But there was no way Noel was talking about Knox. He had a good twenty-eight years left to serve.\n “Isn’t that crazy?” Aspen was saying.\n “Hmm?” I glanced over and realized both Noel and Aspen were watching me. “Oh! Yeah. Insane.”\n Noel sent me an odd look. “So, what’re you doing here today? More book talk?”\n “Uh...no.” I waved a hand, letting him know my day wasn’t nearly as eventful as his story. “My boyfriend cheated on me, pretty much kicked me out of my apartment, and then moved in his new whore...without informing me of the changes first. That’s all.”\n Noel blinked. Then a frown creased his forehead. Finally, he said, “He...what? He cheated on you? Is he fucking stupid?”\n Yeah, that question still warmed me from the inside out. “That’s exactly what your wife said.”\n “It was,” Aspen confirmed.\n Noel grinned at her and reached out to yank her against his chest. “Of course it was. Because you’re the smartest woman I know.”\n As they did that kissy-make-babies-with-their-eyes thing again, I groaned. “Still here.”\n Noel growled and tore his mouth from Aspen’s but kept his forehead mashed to hers.\n “She’s going to need a place to stay,” Aspen started.\n “Hell, yes, she can stay here.” Noel glanced at me to announce, “We’ll bunk you in Brandt’s room.”\n Again, exactly what Aspen had said. These two were so tuned in to each other it was sickening. A good sickening that made me really jealous and all heart-hurt.\n Before I could refuse their offer, the back door opened again, and this time Noel’s fifteen-year-old brother burst inside with a book bag slung over his shoulder.\n “Wuz up?” he greeted the two at the counter, not yet spotting me.\n Noel scowled. “Why are you home so late?”\n Brandt merely rolled his eyes. “I was at Sarah’s doing homework. Algebra is kicking my ass, and of course she’s acing it. But the damn girl still wouldn’t let me just copy her answers. I mean, what the hell, right? What’s the point of having a fucking genius for a best friend if she makes you work out every problem by yourself and then gets off on telling you how wrong you got all the answers? Damn braggart.”\n “As well she shouldn’t let you cheat off her,” Aspen scolded.\n “And how many times have I asked you to watch your language in front of Aspen and her friends,” Noel added.\n “Her friends?” Brandt lifted an eyebrow and glanced over to finally catch sight of me sitting at the table.\n “Oh, hey, Felicity.” He lowered his voice as he swaggered my way. “You look extra beautiful today. How’re you doing?”\n “Oh, brother,” Noel muttered under his breath.\n “I’m good, thanks.” Then I shrugged. “I mean, other than the fact my boyfriend cheated on me, kicked me out of my own apartment, and left me basically homeless.”\n His jaw dropped. “Holy shit. Cam cheated on you? Is he fucking stupid?”\n God, I loved this family.\n “Yeah, so she gets your room until she can find a new place of her own,” Noel announced.\n Brandt frowned at him only to whirl back to me, a huge smile breaking across his face. “Hell, yes, you can sleep in my bed.” Then he leaned down to murmur into my ear, “I’m a great cuddler.”\n While Aspen laughed, Noel smacked his brother on the back of the head. “You’re getting the couch, moron.”\n I couldn’t answer, because honestly—or maybe I should say sadly—Brandt Gamble’s offer of male companionship was the best I’d heard in six long, dry years. Too bad the cutie-pie was complete jailbait. I might’ve actually considered him.\n Needing more to drink because I’d suddenly found myself saddled with a houseful of Gambles, I reached for my now watered-down iced tea and began to guzzle.\n Here was to the rest of my miserable life.\n We met four more times at our tree. Twice, he was late because he couldn’t get away any sooner without rousing suspicion, but he never failed to show eventually, with baby Bentley tucked in his arms. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-36.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: \n I fell in love once. \n It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. \n I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. \n Our love could conquer all. \n Until it didn\u0027t. \n So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. \n It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. \n Or so I thought. \n Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I\u0027m older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless ex-con like me. \n So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away. \n Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway. \n This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper... \n --Knox Parker\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}}
