It wasn’t like Bainbridge money was dirty or anything. Then again, I guess I understood the pride part of it. Still, his answer left a tense lull in the air. When a sound came from Bentley, we both looked down as if eager for a diversion. Her eyes were closed as she shifted in her sleep and turned her face toward the warmth of Knox’s chest...lucky girl. “Is she...” I wrinkled my nose. “Is she snoring?” He chuckled. “I think so.” He sent me a curious look. “You want to hold her again? While she’s sleeping like this.” I immediately shook my head, still too intimidated by the ten-pound kid. “No, that’s okay. I’ll just...I’m fine with watching you hold her.” The way he looked at me made me realize how I’d just announced I wanted to watch him. My face flamed hot. But he only grinned. “Okay, then.” Backing up a few steps until he had his back to the tree, he lowered himself to his haunches and then sat on the ground. Then he resituated the baby on his shoulder and heaved out a relaxed sigh as he closed his eyes. He made it look so inviting I eased down a few feet away, facing him. After resting my hands on my crossed knees and letting out my own deep breath, I bit my lip, realizing there was really no more reason for me to sit here, watching Knox Parker hold a sleeping baby. I’d come to meet Bentley, interact with my niece, not drool over some cute boy. But nothing was going to make me leave just yet. Needing to speak before I imploded from the overwhelming effects of girl-crushing-in-the-presence-of-a-hot-guy anxiety, I blurted, “It’s really nice and peaceful out here, isn’t it?” Knox didn’t open his eyes, but he did smile, which was...oh my God, absolutely beautiful. “This is my favorite place on earth.” Mine too. I might have sighed. His eyes came open. Crap, I hope he hadn’t heard that. Uncrossing my legs, I pulled them together and bent them up to my chest, hugging them and hiding as much of myself as possible. “So, uh...” I glanced around the quiet forest, where I couldn’t even spot a squirrel to talk about. “What did the duck say when he bought lipstick?” When Knox snorted, I glanced at him and frowned. “What?” He shook his head. “You’re not getting me this time. Ducks don’t buy lipstick.” One of my legs escaped my arm hug and straightened so I could reach it out and nudge his foot with mine. “Come on. Just play along.” “No way.” He laughed and shook his head. “I’m not falling for that again. If mutes don’t talk, then ducks don’t wear freaking lipstick.” “Okay, fine.” I sighed dramatically, even though I kind of loved that he was talking to me...even if it was about duck lipstick. “Theoretically, if a duck were to wear lipstick and have the ability to speak, what do you think it’d say if it ever bought lipstick?” His mouth opened, but no words came. A thoughtful frown creased his brow before he slumped his shoulders and shook his head. “I give up. What would a duck say?” I let a dramatic second of silence follow his question before I answered, “Put it on my bill.” Knox stared at me, squinting slightly before he closed his eyes, bowed his head and sighed. “Seriously, Bainbridge? That’s awful. It’s even cheesier than the mute-midget joke.” “It is not!” Okay, it might’ve been. But my gut instinct to disagree with him flared to life, because I really liked to argue-banter with Knox Parker. “Someone needs to teach you some good and dirty, lewd jokes.” I rolled my eyes. “Why do you think dirty jokes are so much better than nice, safe, clean ones?” His grin was pure, smoking hot, mischievous bad boy. “Because...everything’s better when it’s dirty.” Feeling the urge to fan my face and sigh while melting into a puddle of raging hormones, I gulped down my initial reaction and gripped my knees tighter to my chest. “Fine,” I said, trying to sound airy and all whatever, even though my voice was a little too high to accomplish such a feat. “I’ll never bother you with my completely appropriate, clean jokes ever again, then.” “Oh, don’t be that way,” he chided through a grin. “You know I was just kidding.” It was his turn to nudge my sandals with his ratted sneaker. “Come on. Hit me with another. I swear, I won’t bash this one.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-29.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: I fell in love once. It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. Our love could conquer all. Until it didn\u0027t. So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. Or so I thought. Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I\u0027m older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless ex-con like me. So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away. Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway. This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper... --Knox Parker","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}}
