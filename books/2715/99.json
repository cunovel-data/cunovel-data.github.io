After a second, he asked, “What is it?” “What’s it feel like?” “I have no idea. Something soft and fuzzy with a little metal tube.” “The soft fuzzy part is a rabbit foot.” “A what? Eww.” “Hey, I got this eww, gross rabbit foot from a hoodoo priestess,” I said, pitching my voice low. “And I got it just for you, because they’re full of good luck and protect you from harm. But...not just any rabbit foot from any ol’ rabbit will do. Only the left hind foot brings good luck, and not just any left hind foot. The rabbit has to be caught in a cemetery on a full moon and the foot chopped off while the rabbit is still...alive. So don’t you dare take my gift lightly. Somewhere in a cemetery, there’s a three-footed rabbit limping around, just so you could be protected. And I haven’t even gotten to the coolest part yet.” “What?” he asked, sounding totally interested. “The tube connected to it is actually monster repellant.” “Nuh-uh. There’s no such thing.” “Oh, yes, there is. Whenever you think a monster might be near, you spray this baby in your mouth—it’s actually very minty flavored—and it keeps any and every monster away from you. Go ahead.” I nudged him. “Try it. Spray a squirt into your mouth.” After a second, I heard the aerosol spray go off. “Ugh,” he muttered. “That’s disgusting.” Then he smacked his lips together a few times and added, “But not too bad.” “And?” I asked, “Do you see any monsters?” “Well...no. But you’re here. They wouldn’t come out with an adult in the room.” “I guess there’s only one way to really test these things then. Let’s go to your room.” He followed readily and let me tuck him into his bed. “You keep the lucky rabbit foot and monster repellant both under your pillow, okay? And we’ll see if anything else bugs you for the rest of the night. If you sense even the presence of one, you just yank both gadgets out and put them to work. See if they help, okay?” “Okay. I’ll try them.” He let me leave, and when I checked on him five minutes later as I promised him I would, he was fast asleep. I could see his hand in the moonlight coming in through the window, though, and my gifts were tightly clasped in his grip. Feeling as if my job were done, I went back to my room alone. Except I tossed and turned because I kept thinking about Knox, wishing it were that easy to take away whatever nightmares were haunting him. When I woke, I felt gritty and worn and even more depressed. I’d pushed Knox so hard already. Maybe I should just let him be and give up. Except the idea of him being finally free of prison and not with me gave me a small panic attack. I wasn’t sure if I could give up, because he was the only thing I’d ever really wanted. I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if I stopped dreaming of being with him. “Morning,” Aspen chirped as I trudged into the kitchen. I mumbled something I hoped she took as, “Good morning,” and shuffled directly to the coffeemaker. Once I poured myself a cup, I slumped into a chair across from her and Noel. They stared at me a little too brightly...and expectantly. I finally muttered, “What?” when neither of them said anything. Aspen snickered. “So... he was too dark and brooding for you, huh?” “Oh, hell,” I muttered, slapping my hand to my forehead. “Ten has a big mouth, you know that?” “Oh, we know.” Noel grinned and sipped at his own steaming brew. “I’m just glad it was you and not us he was gossiping about this time.” Covering his wife’s hand, he sent her a small smile. It was such a sweet, loving gesture, and the look in their eyes was full of so much adoration and commitment, I burst into tears. “Oh my God. Felicity?” Aspen was out of her chair and flying around to sit by me and take my hand so fast I laughed through my tears, and then went back to sobbing. “Honey, what is it?” “Did Parker hurt you?” Noel demanded. “No,” I wailed. “He would never. I just...” Oh hell, this was so mortifying, and I still couldn’t help but make a total fool of myself as I wailed, “I just...I love him so much.” “What the hell?” Noel sputtered. “The other night, you didn’t even know him.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-99.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: I fell in love once. It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. Our love could conquer all. Until it didn\u0027t. So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. Or so I thought. Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I\u0027m older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless ex-con like me. So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away. Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway. This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper... --Knox Parker","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}}
