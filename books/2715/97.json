Wait.” He moved down my body as I gaped at him in absolute confusion, but then he said, “There was one more thing I wanted to do before you...” He didn’t bother to finish his explanation. He pressed his mouth between my legs and licked me.\n I screamed and bucked against him. He shoved his fingers deep, swirled his tongue over a knotted bundle of nerves, and I came so hard I went lightheaded and slightly oxygen deprived. But the bolts of energy radiating from me felt so freaking good, I rode the high, not even caring.\n By the time I came down, I felt limp and satiated, ready to pass out and sleep for a decade.\n Knox blew out a breath and collapsed beside me, lying on his side so he could watch me. I rolled onto my side so I could face him too. We grinned like idiots at each other until we started to laugh.\n Then I held up a hand. “Okay, I just have to say...I freaking love third base.”\n He laughed and kissed my lips in the moonlight. “Yeah, so do I.”\n I shook my head, studying his beautiful, perfect face as he pulled back. “How’d you ever know to do something like that?”\n He shrugged. “My dad watches a lot of porn.”\n “Oh.” I bit my lip, my thoughts swirling. Then I whispered, “Knox?”\n His lashes fluttered as if he could pass out too. Then he murmured, “Hmm?”\n “Can I confess something to you?”\n Eyes opening, he nodded. “Of course.”\n “My brothers watch a lot of porn too.”\n When I reached between us and snapped open the top button of his jeans, he sucked in a breath. “City?”\n I lowered the zipper slowly. “Can I do to you what you just did to me?”\n “Uh...” Words seemed to fail him as I slipped my hand into the opening and clutched him through his underwear.\n “I think the answer you’re looking for is yes.”\n He groaned as I stroked him. “Yes. Oh...fuck. Yes, okay. But only if you want to.”\n “Oh, I want to. I want to so very, very badly.”\n Wiping a hand over his face, he watched as I drew him free of his underwear, then he lifted his hips so I could push his clothes out of the way. When I returned to his cock, I was amazed at how soft it was over the hardness beneath the surface. The slit at the end of the mushroomed head seeped a syrupy drop, so I leaned down and licked it away.\n He reacted violently, clutching my hair and surging his hips up. But a second later, he slammed his butt back to the dock under him. “Sorry, sorry. Did I hurt you?”\n “No. In fact,” I took his hand and placed it back in my hair. “I kind of liked that response.”\n Then I put my mouth around the entire head. The groan that followed and his grip in my hair told me just how much he liked it. So I moved down, taking in more. All I really knew was that I was supposed to suck and not bite. Wrapping my lips around my teeth, I used suction to pull him in deeper. He shuddered, every muscle in him seeming to spasm out of control\n “Fucking hell,” he gritted out. “I’m not going to last long.”\n I pulled out some only to suck as much as I could handle back in. It didn’t take long to learn from his reactions that he liked speed and pressure, and lots of suction.\n “City. I’m gonna... God, I’m gonna come.”\n Excited I was doing it right, I picked up the pace, but he clutched my hair hard and pulled me off him. Gripping the base, he pumped furiously for two or three strokes before cream shot out over his stomach. I gaped at how much came out of him.\n “Oh, God,” he said, thumping the back of his head on the dock as he tried to regulate his breathing. “That was...so much better than masturbating.”\n I grinned because his shock and pleasure was adorable. “Thanks for pulling me off at the end,” I said, glancing at the stream of semen pooled on his stomach. “I didn’t realize there would be quite that much.”\n He laughed and looked down at it too. “Yeah, I didn’t figure you should swallow the first time out.”\n “Yeah,” I agreed, beginning to frown. “How’re we supposed to clean it off?” I glanced at my dress, then my underwear, knowing it would be noble to let him use either of those to wipe his stomach clean, but...eww. I just couldn’t.\n I think my expression amused him. He laughed again. “Well, there is a large body of water right there. What do you say to...skinny-dipping?”\n I grinned at the idea. “Well, I am already naked.”\n He glanced at his jeans shoved down to his thighs. “And I could get there soon.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-97.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: \n I fell in love once. \n It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. \n I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. \n Our love could conquer all. \n Until it didn\u0027t. \n So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. \n It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. \n Or so I thought. \n Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I\u0027m older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless ex-con like me. \n So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away. \n Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway. \n This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper... \n --Knox Parker\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}}
