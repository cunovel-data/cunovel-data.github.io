I always want more.”\n “Me too.” She dived back at my mouth, and I kissed her again.\n “Can I just keep you the rest of the night?” For the rest of forever.\n Sighing as I sprinkled kisses along her jaw, she finally answered, “What about your sister?”\n My groan told her I didn’t want to think about that. I just wanted this moment to last. “Five more minutes,” I begged.\n “Sold.” She bit my ear, and I almost came in my jeans.\n “God, that was... Do that again.”\n Her teeth nipped tender flesh, and I groaned as I backed her against the wall of a building. Then I lifted her so I could fit my hips between her thighs. Her eyes widened but she wrapped her legs around my waist as she gripped my shoulders. I settled against her, my aching erection nudging the very heat of her.\n “Oh my,” she murmured, her chest heaving and eyes wide with wonder.\n I knew she liked it, but I asked, “Too much?” anyway.\n She whipped her head back and forth. “Not even a little.”\n With a grin, I went in for another kiss. This one exploded with tongue and teeth. I ground against her hard and she balled fistfuls of the back of my shirt with her hands as she clamped her thighs around me tight.\n “Knox.” Her voice was high and desperate. “I need... I need...”\n Fuck, so did I. I needed it bad. I needed all of her, right then.\n “I know. I do too. I want you so—”\n “Hey, Bainbridge,” a voice called from a distance. “Over here.”\n Felicity yelped, and I nearly pissed my pants. She released her legs from me as fast as I dropped her to the ground. Then I spun toward the call and stepped in front of her, protecting her from view.\n “Oh my God. Oh my God,” she whimpered against my back, gripping my shirt hard. I held my hand back behind me, catching her hip blindly to reassure her. I’d never let anything bad happen to her.\n When we heard footsteps, we both tensed. I held my breath, and I swear, she did, too.\n Another ten seconds of waiting later, I decided to breathe. Then I whispered, “Whoever it was, I don’t think they were calling to you.”\n “What? But... They said Bainbridge. Didn’t they?”\n “Yeah.” I nodded, still frowning in the direction we’d heard the call. As I crept out of the overhang of a building and down the darkened street toward the end of the block that intersected with a wider, more populated and lit-up boulevard, City clutched my shirt tighter and shadowed my every step. “You said your brother brought you into town, right?”\n “Yeah, but... Max? You think Max is this close by?”\n I shook my head and slowed my pace to a cautious slink as I neared the intersection. “No idea, but we should probably find out.”\n “But—” She smashed herself against my spine, shaking as I slowly peeked around the corner. When I saw two people walking toward each other under a street lamp, I released a breath.”\n “It is Max,” City whispered, making me jump, because for a split second there, I’d forgotten she was with me. I was too busy staring at the girl Max was meeting.\n I glanced at her. “And Mercy,” I added.\n “What?” She turned her attention to the girl, squinting a moment before her eyes bulged. “Oh my God, it is. But...” Shaking her head, she frowned in confusion. “Why is Max meeting her?”\n I knew. An image of Bentley rose in my head, her big blue eyes and bright red hair. Yeah, I knew exactly why Max Bainbridge was meeting my sister.\n We’d accused the wrong brother. And Mercedes had never corrected us.\n My muscles tensed as I glared at the boy who’d abandoned her after getting her pregnant. I wanted to storm out there and beat the shit out of the rich, entitled prick.\n But Felicity’s hand on my arm rattled me from my self-righteous rage. “Knox? What’s wrong?”\n I shook my head, too busy listening to what the secret lovers down the street had to say to each other.\n “Why did you want to meet, Mercedes?” Max’s voice was cool and his gaze hard as he looked at my sister as if she were a cheap piece of trash.\n Mercy lifted her chin and stuck out her chest. “I just wanted to call you a fucking liar to your face. You said you’d help me out if I ever found myself...in trouble.”\n Max took an intimidating step closer to her, and my muscles coiled. But City’s restraining hand on my chest stopped me. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-68.html","bookId":2715,"book":{"id":2715,"title":"Worth It (Forbidden Men #6)","description":"Storyline: \n I fell in love once. \n It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing. \n I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. \n Our love could conquer all. \n Until it didn\u0027t. \n So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. \n It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. \n Or so I thought. \n Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before.
