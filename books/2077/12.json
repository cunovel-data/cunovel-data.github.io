{"id":111755,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Fhea settled on the box springs, not the most comfortable seat. \"Now, this all happened back in the days when there was still magic, okay? And Helle-wise could do magic, and so could most of the people in her tribe. She was the daughter of Hecate Witch-Queen-\"\n \"She was a witch?\" Roz sounded intrigued.\n \"Well-they didn\u0027t call it that then. They called her a Hearth-Woman. And she didn\u0027t look like a Halloween witch. She was beautiful: tall, with long yellow hair-\"\n \"Like you.\"\n \"Huh? Oh.\" Thea grinned. \"Thanks, but, no. Helle-wise was really beautiful-and she was smart and strong, too. And when Hecate died, Hellewise became co-leader of the tribe. The other leader was her sister, Maya.\"\n Rosamund\u0027s whole head was above the mattress now. She was listening with fierce, if skeptical, interest.\n \"Now, Maya.\" Thea chewed her lip. \"Well, Maya was beautiful, too: tall, but with long black hair.\"\n \"Like that girl who came to the vet\u0027s after you.\"\n Thea was briefly startled. She\u0027d forgotten Rosamund had seen Blaise. \"Well-uh, maybe a little. Anyway, Maya was smart and strong, too-but she didn\u0027t like having to share the leadership with Hellewise. She wanted to rule alone, and she wanted something else. To live forever.\"\n \"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" Rosamund growled.\n \"Well-yeah, there\u0027s nothing wrong with being immortal, I agree. Except, see, that it all depends on how much you\u0027re willing to pay to be it. Okay? Following me?\"\n \"Nope.\"\n \"Well...\" Thea floundered. Any Night Person would know immediately what she was talking about, even if by some outrageous chance they hadn\u0027t already heard the story. But of course humans were different. \"Well, you see, it was a matter of what she had to do. No ordinary spell would make her immortal. She tried all sorts of things, and Hellewise even helped her. And finally they figured out what kind of spell would do it-but then Hellewise refused.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because it was too awful. No, don\u0027t ask me,\" Thea added as Rosamund\u0027s interest level immediately shot up. \"I\u0027m not going to tell you. It\u0027s not a subject for kids.\u0027\n \"What, what? If you don\u0027t tell me, I\u0027m just going to imagine even worse things.\"\n Thea sighed. \"It had to do with babies, okay? And blood. But that\u0027s not the point of this story-\" \"They killed babies?\"\n \"Not Hellewise. Maya did. And Hellewise tried to stop her, but-\" \"I bet she drank the blood.\" Thea stopped and looked hard at Rosamund. Human kids were ignorant, but not dumb. \"Okay, yes, she drank the blood. Satisfied?\" Roz grinned, nodded, and sat back, listening avidly. \"Okay, so then Maya became immortal. But the thing was, she didn\u0027t know until afterward the price she\u0027d have to pay. She would live forever-but only if she drank the blood of a mortal creature every day. Otherwise, she\u0027d die.\"\n \"Like a vampire,\" Rosamund said with relish. Thea was shocked for an instant, then she laughed at herself. Of course humans knew about vampires- the same way they knew about witches. Silly legends filled with misinformation.\n But that meant Thea could tell her own story without fear of being believed.\n \"Just like a vampire, actually,\u0027 she said impressively, holding Rosamund\u0027s eyes. \"Maya was the first vampire of all. And all her children were cursed to be vampires, too.\"\n Roz snorted. \"Vampires can\u0027t have children.\" She looked doubtful. \"Can they?\"\n \"The ones descended from Maya can,\" Thea said. She wasn\u0027t going to say the word \"lamia\" to a human. \"It\u0027s only the kind who get made into vampires by being bitten that can\u0027t. Maya had a vampire son called Red Fern and she bit people. That\u0027s the story, you see-Maya wanted to make everybody like her. So she started biting people in the tribe. And eventually Hellewise decided she had to stop it.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"Well, that was the problem. Hellewise\u0027s tribe wanted to fight with Maya and the other vampires. But Hellewise knew if they did that, they\u0027d probably all get killed. Both sides. So Hellewise challenged Maya alone to a duel. Single combat.\"\n Rosamund pushed the mattress over with a thump. \"I\u0027d fight a duel with Mr. Hendries-he\u0027s the boys\u0027 trekleader.\" She jumped on the mattress and attacked a pillow with hands and feet-and teeth. \"I\u0027d win, too. He\u0027s out of shape.\"\n \"Well, Hellewise didn\u0027t want to fight, but she had to. She was scared, because as a vampire Maya was a lot stronger now.\"\n For a moment, Thea thought about it, visualizing the old story the way she had as a child. Seeing Hellewise in her white leather shift, standing in the dark forest and waiting for Maya to come. And knowing that even if she won the fight, she\u0027d probably die-and being brave enough to keep standing there. Being willing to give up everything for the people she loved, and for peace.\n I don\u0027t think I could ever be that brave. I mean,\n I\u0027d certainly hope I would be, but I have a terrible feeling that I wouldn\u0027t.\n And then a strange thing happened. At that instant, she seemed to hear a voice, not her usual mind-voice, but one that was urgent and almost accusatory. Asking a question as if Thea hadn\u0027t just decided on the answer. Would you give up everything? Thea shifted. She didn\u0027t usually hear voices. I suppose that\u0027s what Hellewise must have been thinking, she told herself uneasily.\n \"So what happened? Hey! Thea! What happened?\" Rosamund was war-dancing on the mattress.\n \"Oh. Well, it was a terrible fight, but Hellewise won. She drove Maya away. And the tribe was left in peace, and they all lived happily ever after... um, except Hellewise. She died of her wounds.\"\n Rosamund stopped dancing and stared in disbelief. \"And you\u0027re telling me this to make me feel better? I never heard such a lousy story.\" Her chin began to tremble.\n Thea forgot she was dealing with a human child. She held out her arms the way she had to Bud the puppy, the way she would have to any creature in pain-and Rosamund threw herself into them.\n \"No, no,\" Thea said, anxiously cuddling. \"You see, the point is that Hellewise\u0027s people lived on, and they were free. And that may seem like a little thing, because they were just a little tribe, but that little tribe got bigger and bigger, and they stayed free. And all the witches in the world are descended from them, and they all remember Hellewise and honor her. It\u0027s a story every mother tells her daughters.\"\n Rosamund breathed irregularly for a moment. \"What about her sons?\"\n \"Well, her sons, too. When I say \u0027daughters\u0027 I mean \u0027sons and daughters.\u0027 It\u0027s just shorter.\"\n One green eye looked up from a mop of shaggy hair. \"like \u0027he\u0027 and \u0027him\u0027 are supposed to mean \u0027she\u0027 and \u0027her,\u0027 too?\"\n \"Yeah.\" Thea thought. \"I guess maybe neither is the best system.\" She shrugged. \"The important thing is that one woman\u0027s courage kept us-them- all free.\"\n \"Look.\" Rosamund straightened up, staring through the hair. \"Are you just jerking my chain or is that a true story? Because frankly you seem like a witch to me.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I was going to say,\" an amused voice behind Thea said.\n Thea\u0027s head snapped around. The door was open a few inches and a woman was standing there. She was tall and lanky, with little glasses and long silky brown hair. Her expression reminded Thea of a look Eric got sometimes, a look of very sweet puzzlement, as if he\u0027d suddenly been struck by one of life\u0027s overwhelming mysteries.\n But that didn\u0027t matter. What mattered was that she was a stranger. An Outsider.\n A human.\n Thea had been blurting out the secrets of the Night World, the history of the witches, and a human adult had been listening.\n Suddenly her hands and feet went numb. The golden haze disappeared, leaving her in a cold, gray reality. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" the human was saying, but to Thea the voice seemed to come from a distance. \"I didn\u0027t mean to startle you. I was just kidding. I really was enjoying the story-sort of a modern legend for kids, right?\"\n Thea\u0027s eyes focused on another human behind the adult. Eric. He\u0027d been listening, too.\n \"Mom\u0027s such a kidder,\" he said nervously. His green eyes were apologetic-and intense. As if he were trying to make a connection with Thea.\n But Thea didn\u0027t want to be connected. Couldn\u0027t be, to these people. She was surrounded by humans, trapped in one of their houses. She felt like the rattlesnake in a circle of big creatures with sticks. Sheer, raw panic overtook her. \"You should be a writer, you know?\" the human woman was saying. \"All that creativity...\" She took a step inside the room.\n Thea stood up, dumping Rosamund on the floor. They were coming at her-by now, the very walls seemed to be closing in. They were alien, cruel, sadistic, terrorizing, evil, not-her-kind. They were Cotton Mather and the Inquisition and they knew about her. They were going to point at her in the street and cry \"Witch!\" Thea ran.\n She slipped between Eric and his mother like a\n frightened cat, not touching either of them. She ran\n down the hall, through the living room, out the door.\n Outside, the sky was clouded over and it was getting dark. Thea only stopped long enough to get her bearings, then headed west, walking as fast as she could. Her heart was pounding and telling her to go faster.\n Get away, get away. Go to earth. Find home.\n She turned corners and zigzagged, like a fox being chased by the hounds.\n She was ten minutes from the house when she heard an engine pacing her. She looked. It was Eric\u0027s jeep. Eric was driving and his mother and Rosamund were passengers.\n \"Thea, stop. Please wait.\" Eric stopped the jeep and jumped out.\n He was on the sidewalk in front of her. Thea froze.\n \"Listen to me,\" he said in a low voice, turning away from the jeep. \"I\u0027m sorry they came, too-I couldn\u0027t stop them. Mom feels awful. She\u0027s crying, Roz is crying... please, won\u0027t you come back?\"\n He looked close to crying himself. Thea just felt numb.\n \"It\u0027s okay. I\u0027m fine,\" she said at random. \"I didn\u0027t mean to upset anybody.\" Please let me go away.\n \"Look, we shouldn\u0027t have eavesdropped. I know that. It was just... you\u0027re so good with Rosamund. I never saw anybody she liked so much. And... and... I know you\u0027re sensitive about your grandma. That\u0027s why you\u0027re upset, isn\u0027t it? That story is something she told you, isn\u0027t it?\"\n Dimly, somewhere in the pit of Thea\u0027s mind, a light shone. At least he thought it was a story.\n \"We have family stories too,\" Eric was saying, an edge of desperation in his voice. \"My grandpa used to\n tell us he was a Martian-I swear to God this is true. And then he went to my kindergarten Back to School and I\u0027d told all the kids he was a Martian, and they made these beep-beep noises at him and laughed, and I felt so bad. He was really embarrassed....\"\n He was babbling. Thea\u0027s numbness had receded enough that she felt sorry for him. But then a shape loomed up and she tensed again. It was his mother, silky hair flying.\n \"Look, Thea,\" Eric\u0027s mother said. Her expression was wretched and earnest. \"Everybody knows your grandma, knows how old she is, how she\u0027s a little... quirky. But if she\u0027s scaring you-if she\u0027s telling you any kind of weird stuff-\" \"Mom!\" Eric shouted through his teeth. She waved a hand at him. Her little glasses were steamed up. \"You don\u0027t need to deal with that, okay? No kid needs to deal with that. If you want a place to stay; if you need anything-if we need to call social services-\"\n \"Mom, please, I\u0027m begging you. Shut up.\" Social services, Thea was thinking. Dear Isis, there\u0027ll be some sort of investigation. The Harmans in court. Gran accused of being senile-or being part of some cult. And then the Night World coming in to enforce the law....\n Her terror peaked and left her deadly calm. \"It\u0027s okay,\" she said, turning her gaze toward Eric. Not looking at him, but going through the motions exactly. \"Your mom\u0027s just trying to be helpful. But really\"-she turned the same face toward his mother-\"everything\u0027s okay. Gran isn\u0027t strange or anything. She does tell stories-but she doesn\u0027t scare anybody.\"\n Is that good enough? Close enough to whatever you believe? Will it make you leave me alone?\n Apparently so. \"I just don\u0027t want to be responsible for you and Eric-well...\" Eric\u0027s mom exhaled nervously, almost a laugh.\n \"Breaking up?\" Thea made a sound that was also almost a laugh. \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027d never want that.\" She turned a smile on Eric, looking down because she couldn\u0027t meet his eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry if I got- touchy. I was just-embarrassed, I guess. Like you said about your grandpa.\"\n \"Will you come back with us? Or let us take you home?\" Eric\u0027s voice was soft. He wanted her to go back to his house.\n \"Just home, if you don\u0027t mind. I\u0027ve got homework.\" She lifted her eyes, making herself smile again.\n Eric nodded. He didn\u0027t look happy, but he wasn\u0027t as upset as he had been.\n In the backseat of the jeep, Rosamund pushed up against Thea and squeezed her hand.\n \"Don\u0027t be mad,\" she hissed, fierce as ever. \"Are you mad? I\u0027m sorry. Want me to kill somebody for you?\"\n \"I\u0027m not mad,\" Thea whispered, looking over the top of Rosamund\u0027s shaggy head. \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\n She had reverted to the strategy of any trapped animal. Wait and watch for your chance. Don\u0027t fight until you see a real opportunity to get away.\n \"See you tomorrow,\" Eric said as she got out of the jeep. His voice was almost a plea.\n \"See you tomorrow,\" Thea said. It wasn\u0027t time to get away yet. She waved until the jeep was gone.\n Then it was time. She dashed inside, up the stairs, and straight to Blaise.\n \"Wait a minute,\" Blaise said. \"Go back. So you\u0027re saying they didn\u0027t believe any of it.\"\n \"Right. At worst Eric\u0027s mom thinks Gran\u0027s bonkers. But it was a close call. For a while there I thought she might want to get Gran declared unfit or something.\"\n The two of them were sitting on the floor by Blaise\u0027s bed where Thea had collapsed. Blaise was eating candy corn with one hand and scribbling on a yellow legal pad with the other, all the while listening attentively.\n Because that was the thing about Blaise. She might be vain and self-centered, quarrelsome, hot-tempered, lazy, unkind to humans, and generally hard to live with, but she came through for family. She was a witch.\n I\u0027m sorry I said you might be a little like Maya, Thea thought.\n \"It\u0027s my fault,\" she said out loud.\n \"Yes, it is,\" Blaise said, scribbling.\n \"I should have just found some way to keep him at a distance in the beginning.\"\n But of course, it was because of Blaise that she hadn\u0027t. She\u0027d thought Eric was safer with her than he would have been with Blaise. She\u0027d thought that somehow... somehow...\n Things would work out. That was it. There had always been some secret underlying hope that there could be a future with Eric. Some little hiding place where she\u0027d kept the hope that things could be all right.\n But now she had to face reality.\n There was no future.\n The only thing she could give Eric was death. And that was all he could give her. She\u0027d realized that, all in one terrible explosion of insight when she\u0027d seen Eric\u0027s mother in the room.\n There was no way for them to be together without being discovered. Even if they ran away, someday, somewhere, the Night People would find them. They\u0027d be brought before the joint Night World Council, the vampire and witch elders. And then the law would be fulfilled....\n Thea had never seen an execution, but she\u0027d heard of them. And if the Harmans tried to stop the Council from killing her, it would start a war. Witches against vampires. Maybe even witches against witches. It could mean the end of everything.\n \"So it doesn\u0027t look like we have to kill the mother,\" Blaise said, frowning at her scribbles. \"On the other hand, if we kill the kids, the mother\u0027s bound to be unhappy, and might make a connection. So to be safe-\"\n \"We can\u0027t kill any of them,\" Thea said. Her voice was muted but final.\n \"I don\u0027t mean ourselves. I\u0027m going to call one of our friendly vampire cousins. Ash-he\u0027s supposed to be out on the West Coast somewhere, isn\u0027t he? Or\n Quinn, he likes that kind of thing. One quick bite, let the blood run out-\"\n \"Blaise, I am not going to let vampires kill Eric. Or anybody,\" she added as Blaise opened her mouth. \"It\u0027s not necessary. Nobody needs to die.\"\n \"So you have a better idea?\"\n Thea looked at a statue of Isis, the Queen of Egyptian Goddesses, on the desk. \"I... don\u0027t know. I thought of the Cup of Lethe. Make them forget everything about me. But it might look suspicious-this entire family with a gap in their memory. And kids at school would wonder why Eric doesn\u0027t remember my name anymore.\"\n \"True.\"\n Thea stared at the moon held between Isis\u0027s golden horns. Her brain, which had been working so coldly and logically, helping her to survive, was stalling now. There had to be a way to save Eric and his family-or what was the point of living herself?\n Then she saw it.\n \"What I really think would be best,\" she said slowly, because it hurt like a physical pain, \"would be for Eric to stop caring about me. To fall in love with someone else.\"\n Blaise sat back. She stirred the candy corn with long, elegant nails. She ate a piece.\n \"I admire you,\" she said. \"Very sensible.\"\n \"Not yon,\" Thea said through clenched teeth. \"You understand that, right? A human. If he falls in love with another girl he\u0027ll forget about me without any Lethe. Nobody will disappear or have amnesia; nobody will get suspicious.\"\n \"Okay. Although I would\u0027ve liked to try him. He\u0027s got a strong will-I think he\u0027d have held out for a while. Been a challenge.\"\n Thea ignored this. \"I still have some of his blood. The question is, do you have something you\u0027ve been holding back, some love spell that will completely blow him out of the water?\"\n Blaise ate another piece of candy corn. \"Of course I do.\" She narrowed her gray eyes. \"Also, of course, it\u0027s a forbidden spell.\"\n \"I figured. Blaise, I\u0027m now the princess of forbidden spells. One more doesn\u0027t matter. But I\u0027ll do the actual working, I don\u0027t want you to get in trouble.\"\n \"You won\u0027t like it. It involves the bezoar stone from the stomach of an ibex-which I just happened to pick up while we were living with Aunt Gerdeth.\"\n Ibex were an endangered species. But this one was already dead. \"I\u0027ll do the working,\" Thea said stubbornly.\n \"You really care about him, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes,\" Thea whispered. \"I still think we\u0027re soul-mates. But...\"\n Would you give up everything?\n \"I don\u0027t want to be the reason he dies. Or the reason a war starts between the Harmans and the rest of the Night World. And if I have to give him up, I\u0027d rather do it myself, make sure he\u0027s safe with somebody else who loves him.\"\n \"Have you got somebody picked out?\"\n \"Her name is Pilar.\" Thea looked at her cousin suddenly. \"Blaise? When Luke asked you what you\n wanted, and you said nothing you could have... what did you mean?\"\n Blaise tilted her head back and examined the ceiling. Then she looked down. \"Does anybody ever want anything they can have? Really?\"\n \"I... don\u0027t know.\"\n Blaise clasped her knees and rested her chin on them. \"If we can have things, we don\u0027t really want them anymore. So there\u0027s always something out there that we\u0027re wanting and not able to get... and maybe that\u0027s good.\"\n It didn\u0027t sound good to Thea. It sounded like one of those terrible lessons in Life 101 that were supposed to make you more mature.\n \"Let\u0027s do the spell,\" she said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-spellbinder-night-world-3/page-12.html","bookId":2077,"book":{"id":2077,"title":"Night World : Spellbinder (Night World #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Spellbinder (Night World Book 3) \n When her cousin Blaise, a witch of the black arts, sets her sights on star athlete Eric Ross, white witch Thea casts a spell on the young man to protect him and falls in love despite the rules that forbid a relationship.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/night-world-spellbinder-night-world-3.jpg","author":"L.J.
