{"id":107920,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"THE COUNTER IN ALICE\u0027S BATHROOM WAS COVERED WITH a thousand different products, all claiming to beautify a person\u0027s surface. Since everyone in this house was both perfect and impermeable, I could only assume that she\u0027d bought most of these things with me in mind. I read the labels numbly, struck by the waste.\n I was careful never to look in the long mirror.\n Alice combed through my hair with a slow, rhythmic motion.\n \"That\u0027s enough, Alice,\" I said tonelessly. \"I want to go back to La Push.\"\n How many hours had I waited for Charlie to finally leave Billy\u0027s house so that I could see Jacob? Each minute, not knowing if Jacob was still breathing or not, had seemed like ten lifetimes. And then, when at last I\u0027d been allowed to go, to see for myself that Jacob was alive, the time had gone so quickly. I felt like I\u0027d barely caught my breath before Alice was calling Edward, insisting that I keep up this ridiculous sleepover faade. It seemed so insignificant. . . .\n \"Jacob\u0027s still unconscious,\" Alice answered. \"Carlisle or Edward will call when he\u0027s awake. Anyway, you need to go see Charlie. He was there at Billy\u0027s house, he saw that Carlisle and Edward are back in from their trip, and he\u0027s bound to be suspicious when you get home.\"\n I already had my story memorized and corroborated. \"I don\u0027t care. I want to be there when Jacob wakes up.\"\n \"You need to think of Charlie now. You\u0027ve had a long day - sorry, I know that doesn\u0027t begin to cover it - but that doesn\u0027t mean that you can shirk your responsibilities.\" Her voice was serious, almost chiding. \"It\u0027s more important now than ever that Charlie stays safely in the dark. Play your role first, Bella, and then you can do what you want second. Part of being a Cullen is being meticulously responsible.\"\n Of course she was right. And if not for this same reason - a reason that was more powerful than all my fear and pain and guilt - Carlisle would never have been able to talk me into leaving Jacob\u0027s side, unconscious or not.\n \"Go home,\" Alice ordered. \"Talk to Charlie. Flesh out your alibi. Keep him safe.\"\n I stood, and the blood flowed down to my feet, stinging like the pricks of a thousand needles. I\u0027d been sitting still for a long time.\n \"That dress is adorable on you,\" Alice cooed.\n \"Huh? Oh. Er - thanks again for the clothes,\" I mumbled out of courtesy rather than real gratitude.\n \"You need the evidence,\" Alice said, her eyes innocent and wide. \"What\u0027s a shopping trip without a new outfit? It\u0027s very flattering, if I do say so myself.\"\n I blinked, unable to remember what she\u0027d dressed me in. I couldn\u0027t keep my thoughts from skittering away every few seconds, insects running from the light. . . .\n \"Jacob is fine, Bella,\" Alice said, easily interpreting my preoccupation. \"There\u0027s no hurry. If you realized how much extra morphine Carlisle had to give him - what with his temperature burning it off so quickly - you would know that he\u0027s going to be out for a while.\"\n At least he wasn\u0027t in any pain. Not yet.\n \"Is there anything you want to talk about before you leave?\" Alice asked sympathetically. \"You must be more than a little traumatized.\"\n I knew what she was curious about. But I had other questions.\n \"Will I be like that?\" I asked her, my voice subdued. \"Like that girl Bree in the meadow?\"\n There were many things I needed to think of, but I couldn\u0027t seem to get her out of my head, the newborn whose other life was now - abruptly - over. Her face, twisted with desire for my blood, lingered behind my eyelids.\n Alice stroked my arm. \"Everyone is different. But something like that, yes.\"\n I was very still, trying to imagine.\n \"It passes,\" she promised.\n \"How soon?\"\n She shrugged. \"A few years, maybe less. It might be different for you. I\u0027ve never seen anyone go through this who\u0027s chosen it beforehand. It should be interesting to see how that affects you.\"\n \"Interesting,\" I repeated.\n \"We\u0027ll keep you out of trouble.\"\n \"I know that. I trust you.\" My voice was monotone, dead.\n Alice\u0027s forehead puckered. \"If you\u0027re worried about Carlisle and Edward, I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll be fine. I believe Sam is beginning to trust us . . . well, to trust Carlisle, at least. It\u0027s a good thing, too. I imagine the atmosphere got a little tense when Carlisle had to rebreak the fractures -\"\n \"Please, Alice.\"\n \"Sorry.\"\n I took a deep breath to steady myself. Jacob had begun healing too quickly, and some of his bones had set wrong. He\u0027d been out cold for the process, but it was still hard to think about.\n \"Alice, can I ask you a question? About the future?\"\n She was suddenly wary. \"You know I don\u0027t see everything.\"\n \"It\u0027s not that, exactly. But you do see my future, sometimes. Why is that, do you think, when nothing else works on me? Not what Jane can do, or Edward or Aro . . .\" My sentence trailed off with my interest level. My curiosity on this point was fleeting, heavily overshadowed by more pressing emotions.\n Alice, however, found the question very interesting. \"Jasper, too, Bella - his talent works on your body just as well as it does on anyone else\u0027s. That\u0027s the difference, do you see it? Jasper\u0027s abilities affect the body physically. He really does calm your system down, or excite it. It\u0027s not an illusion. And I see visions of outcomes, not the reasons and thoughts behind the decisions that create them. It\u0027s outside the mind, not an illusion, either; reality, or at least one version of it. But Jane and Edward and Aro and Demetri - they work inside the mind. Jane only creates an illusion of pain. She doesn\u0027t really hurt your body, you only think you feel it. You see, Bella? You are safe inside your mind. No one can reach you there. It\u0027s no wonder that Aro was so curious about your future abilities.\"\n She watched my face to see if I was following her logic. In truth, her words had all started to run together, the syllables and sounds losing their meaning. I couldn\u0027t concentrate on them. Still, I nodded. Trying to look like I got it.\n She wasn\u0027t fooled. She stroked my cheek and murmured, \"He\u0027s going to be okay, Bella. I don\u0027t need a vision to know that. Are you ready to go?\"\n \"One more thing. Can I ask you another question about the future? I don\u0027t want specifics, just an overview.\"\n \"I\u0027ll do my best,\" she said, doubtful again.\n \"Can you still see me becoming a vampire?\"\n \"Oh, that\u0027s easy. Sure, I do.\"\n I nodded slowly.\n She examined my face, her eyes unfathomable. \"Don\u0027t you know your own mind, Bella?\"\n \"I do. I just wanted to be sure.\"\n \"I\u0027m only as sure as you are, Bella. You know that. If you were to change your mind, what I see would change . . . or disappear, in your case.\"\n I sighed. \"That isn\u0027t going to happen, though.\"\n She put her arms around me. \"I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t really empathize. My first memory is of seeing Jasper\u0027s face in my future; I always knew that he was where my life was headed. But I can sympathize. I\u0027m so sorry you have to choose between two good things.\"\n I shook off her arms. \"Don\u0027t feel sorry for me.\" There were people who deserved sympathy. I wasn\u0027t one of them. And there wasn\u0027t any choice to make - there was just breaking a good heart to attend to now. \"I\u0027ll go deal with Charlie.\"\n I drove my truck home, where Charlie was waiting just as suspiciously as Alice had expected.\n \"Hey, Bella. How was your shopping trip?\" he greeted me when I walked into the kitchen. He had his arms folded over his chest, his eyes on my face.\n \"Long,\" I said dully. \"We just got back.\"\n Charlie assessed my mood. \"I guess you already heard about Jake, then?\"\n \"Yes. The rest of the Cullens beat us home. Esme told us where Carlisle and Edward were.\"\n \"Are you okay?\"\n \"Worried about Jake. As soon as I make dinner, I\u0027m going down to La Push.\"\n \"I told you those motorcycles were dangerous. I hope this makes you realize that I wasn\u0027t kidding around.\"\n I nodded as I started pulling things out of the fridge. Charlie settled himself in at the table. He seemed to be in a more talkative mood than usual.\n \"I don\u0027t think you need to worry about Jake too much. Anyone who can cuss with that kind of energy is going to recover.\"\n \"Jake was awake when you saw him?\" I asked, spinning to look at him.\n \"Oh, yeah, he was awake. You should have heard him - actually, it\u0027s better you didn\u0027t. I don\u0027t think there was anyone in La Push who couldn\u0027t hear him. I don\u0027t know where he picked up that vocabulary, but I hope he hasn\u0027t been using that kind of language around you.\"\n \"He had a pretty good excuse today. How did he look?\"\n \"Messed up. His friends carried him in. Good thing they\u0027re big boys, \u0027cause that kid\u0027s an armful. Carlisle said his right leg is broken, and his right arm. Pretty much the whole right side of his body got crushed when he wrecked that damn bike.\" Charlie shook his head. \"If I ever hear of you riding again, Bella -\"\n \"No problem there, Dad. You won\u0027t. Do you really think Jake\u0027s okay?\"\n \"Sure, Bella, don\u0027t worry. He was himself enough to tease me.\"\n \"Tease you?\" I echoed in shock.\n \"Yeah - in between insulting somebody\u0027s mother and taking the Lord\u0027s name in vain, he said, \u0027Bet you\u0027re glad she loves Cullen instead of me today, huh, Charlie?\u0027\"\n I turned back to the fridge so that he couldn\u0027t see my face.\n \"And I couldn\u0027t argue. Edward\u0027s more mature than Jacob when it comes to your safety, I\u0027ll give him that much.\"\n \"Jacob\u0027s plenty mature,\" I muttered defensively. \"I\u0027m sure this wasn\u0027t his fault.\"\n \"Weird day today,\" Charlie mused after a minute. \"You know, I don\u0027t put much stock in that superstitious crap, but it was odd. . . . It was like Billy knew something bad was going to happen to Jake. He was nervous as a turkey on Thanksgiving all morning. I don\u0027t think he heard anything I said to him.\n \"And then, weirder than that - remember back in February and March when we had all that trouble with the wolves?\"\n I bent down to get a frying pan out of the cupboard, and hid there an extra second or two.\n \"Yeah,\" I mumbled.\n \"I hope we\u0027re not going to have a problem with that again. This morning, we were out in the boat, and Billy wasn\u0027t paying any attention to me or the fish, when all of a sudden, you could hear wolves yowling in the woods. More than one, and, boy, was it loud. Sounded like they were right there in the village. Weirdest part was, Billy turned the boat around and headed straight back to the harbor like they were calling to him personally. Didn\u0027t even hear me ask what he was doing.\n \"The noise stopped before we got the boat docked. But all of a sudden Billy was in the biggest hurry not to miss the game, though we had hours still. He was mumbling some nonsense about an earlier showing . . . of a live game? I tell you, Bella, it was odd.\n \"Well, he found some game he said he wanted to watch, but then he just ignored it. He was on the phone the whole time, calling Sue, and Emily, and your friend Quil\u0027s grandpa. Couldn\u0027t quite make out what he was looking for - he just chatted real casual with them.\n \"Then the howling started again right outside the house. I\u0027ve never heard anything like it - I had goose bumps on my arms. I asked Billy - had to shout over the noise - if he\u0027d been setting traps in his yard. It sounded like the animal was in serious pain.\"\n I winced, but Charlie was so caught up in his story that he didn\u0027t notice.\n \"\u0027Course I forgot all about that till just this minute, \u0027cause that\u0027s when Jake made it home. One minute it was that wolf yowling, and then you couldn\u0027t hear it anymore - Jake\u0027s cussing drowned it right out. Got a set of lungs on him, that boy does.\"\n Charlie paused for a minute, his face thoughtful. \"Funny that some good should come out of this mess. I didn\u0027t think they were ever going to get over that fool prejudice they have against the Cullens down there. But somebody called Carlisle, and Billy was real grateful when he showed up. I thought we should get Jake up to the hospital, but Billy wanted to keep him home, and Carlisle agreed. I guess Carlisle knows what\u0027s best.\n Generous of him to sign up for such a long stretch of house calls.\"\n \"And . . .\" he paused, as if unwilling to say something. He sighed, and then continued. \"And Edward was really . . . nice. He seemed as worried about Jacob as you are - like that was his brother lying there. The look in his eyes . . .\" Charlie shook his head. \"He\u0027s a decent guy, Bella. I\u0027ll try to remember that. No promises, though.\" He grinned at me.\n \"I won\u0027t hold you to it,\" I mumbled.\n Charlie stretched his legs and groaned. \"It\u0027s nice to be home. You wouldn\u0027t believe how crowded Billy\u0027s little place gets. Seven of Jake\u0027s friends all squished themselves into that little front room - I could hardly breathe. Have you ever noticed how big those Quileute kids all are?\"\n \"Yeah, I have.\"\n Charlie stared at me, his eyes abruptly more focused. \"Really, Bella, Carlisle said Jake will be up and around in no time. Said it looked a lot worse than it was. He\u0027s going to be fine.\"\n I just nodded.\n Jacob had looked so . . . strangely fragile when I\u0027d hurried down to see him as soon as Charlie had left. He\u0027d had braces everywhere - Carlisle said there was no point in plaster, as fast as he was healing. His face had been pale and drawn, deeply unconscious though he was at the time. Breakable. Huge as he was, he\u0027d looked very breakable. Maybe that had just been my imagination, coupled with the knowledge that I was going to have to break him.\n If only I could be struck by lightning and be split in two. Preferably painfully. For the first time, giving up being human felt like a true sacrifice. Like it might be too much to lose.\n I put Charlie\u0027s dinner on the table next to his elbow and headed for the door.\n \"Er, Bella? Could you wait just a second?\"\n \"Did I forget something?\" I asked, eyeing his plate.\n \"No, no. I just . . . want to ask a favor.\" Charlie frowned and looked at the floor. \"Have a seat - this won\u0027t take long.\"\n I sat across from him, a little confused. I tried to focus. \"What do you need, Dad?\"\n \"Here\u0027s the gist of it, Bella.\" Charlie flushed. \"Maybe I\u0027m just feeling . . . superstitious after hanging out with Billy while he was being so strange all day. But I have this . . . hunch. I feel like . . . I\u0027m going to lose you soon.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be silly, Dad,\" I mumbled guiltily. \"You want me to go to school, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"Just promise me one thing.\"\n I was hesitant, ready to rescind. \"Okay . . .\"\n \"Will you tell me before you do anything major? Before you run off with him or something?\"\n \"Dad . . . ,\" I moaned.\n \"I\u0027m serious. I won\u0027t kick up a fuss. Just give me some advance notice. Give me a chance to hug you goodbye.\"\n Cringing mentally, I held up my hand. \"This is silly. But, if it makes you happy, . . . I promise.\"\n \"Thanks, Bella,\" he said. \"I love you, kid.\"\n \"I love you, too, Dad.\" I touched his shoulder, and then shoved away from the table. \"If you need anything, I\u0027ll be at Billy\u0027s.\"\n I didn\u0027t look back as I ran out. This was just perfect, just what I needed right now. I grumbled to myself all the way to La Push.\n Carlisle\u0027s black Mercedes was not in front of Billy\u0027s house. That was both good and bad. Obviously, I needed to talk to Jacob alone. Yet I still wished I could somehow hold Edward\u0027s hand, like I had before, when Jacob was unconscious. Impossible. But I missed Edward - it had seemed like a very long afternoon alone with Alice. I supposed that made my answer quite obvious. I already knew that I couldn\u0027t live without Edward. That fact wasn\u0027t going to make this any less painful.\n I tapped quietly on the front door.\n \"Come in, Bella,\" Billy said. The roar of my truck was easy to recognize.\n I let myself in.\n \"Hey, Billy. Is he awake?\" I asked.\n \"He woke up about a half hour ago, just before the doctor left. Go on in. I think he\u0027s been waiting for you.\"\n I flinched, and then took a deep breath. \"Thanks.\"\n I hesitated at the door to Jacob\u0027s room, not sure whether to knock. I decided to peek first, hoping - coward that I was - that maybe he\u0027d gone back to sleep. I felt like I could use just a few more minutes.\n I opened the door a crack and leaned hesitantly in.\n Jacob was waiting for me, his face calm and smooth. The haggard, gaunt look was gone, but only a careful blankness took its place. There was no animation in his dark eyes.\n It was hard to look at his face, knowing that I loved him. It made more of a difference than I would have thought. I wondered if it had always been this hard for him, all this time.\n Thankfully, someone had covered him with a quilt. It was a relief not to have to see the extent of the damage.\n I stepped in and shut the door quietly behind me.\n \"Hi, Jake,\" I murmured.\n He didn\u0027t answer at first. He looked at my face for a long moment. Then, with some effort, he rearranged his expression into a slightly mocking smile.\n \"Yeah, I sort of thought it might be like that.\" He sighed. \"Today has definitely taken a turn for the worse. First I pick the wrong place, miss the best fight, and Seth gets all the glory. Then Leah has to be an idiot trying to prove she\u0027s as tough as the rest of us and I have to be the idiot who saves her. And now this.\" He waved his left hand toward me where I hesitated by the door.\n \"How are you feeling?\" I mumbled. What a stupid question.\n \"A little stoned. Dr. Fang isn\u0027t sure how much pain medication I need, so he\u0027s going with trial and error. Think he overdid it.\"\n \"But you\u0027re not in pain.\"\n \"No. At least, I can\u0027t feel my injuries,\" he said, smiling mockingly again.\n I bit my lip. I was never going to get through this. Why didn\u0027t anyone ever try to kill me when I wanted to die?\n The wry humor left his face, and his eyes warmed up. His forehead creased, like he was worried.\n \"How about you?\" he asked, sounding really concerned. \"Are you okay?\"\n \"Me?\" I stared at him. Maybe he had taken too many drugs. \"Why?\"\n \"Well, I mean, I was pretty sure that he wouldn\u0027t actually hurt you, but I wasn\u0027t sure how bad it was going to be. I\u0027ve been going a little crazy with worrying about you ever since I woke up. I didn\u0027t know if you were going to be allowed to visit or anything. The suspense was terrible. How did it go? Was he mean to you? I\u0027m sorry if it was bad. I didn\u0027t mean for you to have to go through that alone. I was thinking I\u0027d be there. . . .\"\n It took me a minute to even understand. He babbled on, looking more and more awkward, until I got what he was saying. Then I hurried to reassure him.\n \"No, no, Jake! I\u0027m fine. Too fine, really. Of course he wasn\u0027t mean. I wish!\"\n His eyes widened in what looked like horror. \"What?\"\n \"He wasn\u0027t even mad at me - he wasn\u0027t even mad at you! He\u0027s so unselfish it makes me feel even worse. I wish he would have yelled at me or something. It\u0027s not like I don\u0027t deserve . . . well, much worse that getting yelled at. But he doesn\u0027t care. He just wants me to be happy.\"\n \"He wasn\u0027t mad?\" Jacob asked, incredulous.\n \"No. He was . . . much too kind.\"\n Jacob stared for another minute, and then he suddenly frowned. \"Well, damn!\" he growled.\n \"What\u0027s wrong, Jake? Does it hurt?\" My hands fluttered uselessly as I looked around for his medication.\n \"No,\" he grumbled in a disgusted tone. \"I can\u0027t believe this! He didn\u0027t give you an ultimatum or anything?\"\n \"Not even close - what\u0027s wrong with you?\"\n He scowled and shook his head. \"I was sort of counting on his reaction. Damn it all. He\u0027s better than I thought.\"\n The way he said it, though angrier, reminded me of Edward\u0027s tribute to Jacob\u0027s lack of ethics in the tent this morning. Which meant that Jake was still hoping, still fighting. I winced as that stabbed deep.\n \"He\u0027s not playing any game, Jake,\" I said quietly.\n \"You bet he is. He\u0027s playing every bit as hard as I am, only he knows what he\u0027s doing and I don\u0027t. Don\u0027t blame me because he\u0027s a better manipulator than I am - I haven\u0027t been around long enough to learn all his tricks.\"\n \"He isn\u0027t manipulating me!\"\n \"Yes, he is! When are you going to wake up and realize that he\u0027s not a perfect as you think he is?\"\n \"At least he didn\u0027t threaten to kill himself to make me kiss him,\" I snapped. As soon as the words were out, I flushed with chagrin. \"Wait. Pretend that didn\u0027t slip out. I swore to myself that I wasn\u0027t going to say anything about that.\"\n He took a deep breath. When he spoke, he was calmer. \"Why not?\"\n \"Because I didn\u0027t come here to blame you for anything.\"\n \"It\u0027s true, though,\" he said evenly. \"I did do that.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care, Jake. I\u0027m not mad.\"\n He smiled. \"I don\u0027t care, either. I knew you\u0027d forgive me, and I\u0027m glad I did it. I\u0027d do it again. At least I have that much. At least I made you see that you do love me. That\u0027s worth something.\"\n \"Is it? Is it really better than if I was still in the dark?\"\n \"Don\u0027t you think you ought to know how you feel - just so that it doesn\u0027t take you by surprise someday when it\u0027s too late and you\u0027re a married vampire?\"\n I shook my head. \"No - I didn\u0027t mean better for me. I meant better for you. Does it make things better or worse for you, having me know that I\u0027m in love with you? When it doesn\u0027t make a difference either way. Would it have been better, easier for you, if I never clued in?\"\n He took my question as seriously as I\u0027d meant it, thinking carefully before he answered. \"Yes, it\u0027s better to have you know,\" hefinally decided. \"If you hadn\u0027t figured it out . . . I\u0027d have always wondered if your decision would have been different if you had. Now I know. I did everything I could.\" He dragged in an unsteady breath, and closed his eyes.\n This time I did not - could not - resist the urge to comfort him. I crossed the small room and kneeled by his head, afraid to sit on the bed in case I jostled it and hurt him, and leaned in to touch my forehead to his cheek.\n Jacob sighed, and put his hand on my hair, holding me there.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry, Jake.\"\n \"I always knew this was a long shot. It\u0027s not your fault, Bella.\"\n \"Not you, too,\" I moaned. \"Please.\"\n He pulled away to look at me. \"What?\"\n \"It is my fault. And I\u0027m so sick of being told it\u0027s not.\"\n He grinned. It didn\u0027t touch his eyes. \"You want me to haul you over the coals?\"\n \"Actually . . . I think I do.\"\n He pursed his lips as he measured how much I meant it. A smile flashed across his face briefly, and then he twisted his expression into a fierce scowl.\n \"Kissing me back like that was inexcusable.\" He spit the words at me. \"If you knew you were just going to take it back, maybe you shouldn\u0027t have been quite so convincing about it.\"\n I winced and nodded. \"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\n \"Sorry doesn\u0027t make anything better, Bella. What were you thinking?\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t,\" I whispered.\n \"You should have told me to go die. That\u0027s what you want.\"\n \"No, Jacob,\" I whimpered, fighting against the budding tears. \"No! Never.\"\n \"You\u0027re not crying?\" he demanded, his voice suddenly back to its normal tone. He twitched impatiently on the bed.\n \"Yeah,\" I muttered, laughing weakly at myself through the tears that were suddenly sobs.\n He shifted his weight, throwing his good leg off the bed as if he were going to try to stand.\n \"What are you doing?\" I demanded through the tears. \"Lie down, you idiot, you\u0027ll hurt yourself!\" I jumped to my feet and pushed his good shoulder down with two hands.\n He surrendered, leaning back with a gasp of pain, but he grabbed me around my waist and pulled me down on the bed, against his good side. I curled up there, trying to stifle the silly sobs against his hot skin. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re crying,\" he mumbled. \"You know I just said those things because you wanted me to. I didn\u0027t mean them.\" His hand rubbed against my shoulders.\n \"I know.\" I took a deep, ragged breath, trying to control myself. How did I end up being the one crying while he did the comforting? \"It\u0027s all still true, though. Thanks for saying it out loud.\"\n \"Do I get points for making you cry?\"\n \"Sure, Jake.\" I tried to smile. \"As many as you want.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry, Bella, honey. It\u0027s all going to work out.\"\n \"I don\u0027t see how,\" I muttered.\n He patted the top of my head. \"I\u0027m going to give in and be good.\"\n \"More games?\" I wondered, tilting my chin so that I could see his face.\n \"Maybe.\" He laughed with a bit of effort, and then winced. \"But I\u0027m going to try.\"\n I frowned.\n \"Don\u0027t be so pessimistic,\" he complained. \"Give me a little credit.\"\n \"What do you mean by \u0027be good\u0027?\"\n \"I\u0027ll be your friend, Bella,\" he said quietly. \"I won\u0027t ask for more than that.\"\n \"I think it\u0027s too late for that, Jake. How can we be friends, when we love each other like this?\"\n He looked at the ceiling, his stare intent, as if he were reading something that was written there. \"Maybe . . . it will have to be a long-distance friendship.\"\n I clenched my teeth together, glad he wasn\u0027t looking at my face, fighting against the sobs that threatened to overtake me again. I needed to be strong, and I had no idea how. . . .\n \"You know that story in the Bible?\" Jacob asked suddenly, still reading the blank ceiling. \"The one with the king and the two women fighting over the baby?\"\n \"Sure. King Solomon.\"\n \"That\u0027s right. King Solomon,\" he repeated. \"And he said, cut the kid in half . . . but it was only a test. Just to see who would give up their share to protect it.\"\n \"Yeah, I remember.\"\n He looked back at my face. \"I\u0027m not going to cut you in half anymore, Bella.\"\n I understood what he was saying. He was telling me that he loved me the most, that his surrender proved it. I wanted to defend Edward, to tell Jacob how Edward would do the same thing if I wanted, if I would let him. I was the one who wouldn\u0027t renounce my claim there. But there was no point in starting an argument that would only hurt him more.\n I closed my eyes, willing myself to control the pain. I couldn\u0027t impose that on him.\n We were quiet for a moment. He seemed to be waiting for me to say something; I was trying to think of something to say.\n \"Can I tell you what the worst part is?\" he asked hesitantly when I said nothing. \"Do you mind? I am going to be good.\"\n \"Will it help?\" I whispered.\n \"It might. It couldn\u0027t hurt.\"\n \"What\u0027s the worst part, then?\"\n \"The worse part is knowing what would have been.\"\n \"What might have been.\" I sighed.\n \"No.\" Jacob shook his head. \"I\u0027m exactly right for you, Bella. It would have been effortless for us - comfortable, easy as breathing. I was the natural path your life would have taken. . . .\" He stared into space for a moment, and I waited. \"If the world was the way it was supposed to be, if there were no monsters and no magic . . .\"\n I could see what he saw, and I knew that he was right. If the world was the sane place it was supposed to be, Jacob and I would have been together. And we would have been happy. He was my soul mate in that world - would have been my soul mate still if his claim had not been overshadowed by something stronger, something so strong that it could not exist in a rational world.\n Was it out there for Jacob, too? Something that would trump a soul mate? I had to believe that it was.\n Two futures, two soul mates . . . too much for any one person. And so unfair that I wouldn\u0027t be the only one to pay for it. Jacob\u0027s pain seemed too high a price. Cringing at the thought of that price, I wondered if I would have wavered, if I hadn\u0027t lost Edward once. If I didn\u0027t know what it was like to live without him. I wasn\u0027t sure. That knowledge was so deep a part of me, I couldn\u0027t imagine how I would feel without it.\n \"He\u0027s like a drug for you, Bella.\" His voice was still gentle, not at all critical. \"I see that you can\u0027t live without him now. It\u0027s too late. But I would have been healthier for you. Not a drug; I would have been the air, the sun.\"\n The corner of my mouth turned up in a wistful half-smile. \"I used to think of you that way, you know. Like the sun. My personal sun. You balanced out the clouds nicely for me.\"\n He sighed. \"The clouds I can handle. But I can\u0027t fight with an eclipse.\"\n I touched his face, laying my hand against his cheek. He exhaled at my touch and closed his eyes. It was very quiet. For a minute I could hear the beating of his heart, slow and even.\n \"Tell me the worst part for you,\" he whispered.\n \"I think that might be a bad idea.\"\n \"Please.\"\n \"I think it will hurt.\"\n \"Please.\"\n How could I deny him anything at this point?\n \"The worst part . . .\" I hesitated, and then let words spill out in a flood of truth. \"The worst part is that I saw the whole thing - our whole life. And I want it bad, Jake, I want it all. I want to stay right here and never move. I want to love you and make you happy. And I can\u0027t, and it\u0027s killing me. It\u0027s like Sam and Emily, Jake - I never had a choice. I always knew nothing would change. Maybe that\u0027s why I was fighting against you so hard.\"\n He seemed to be concentrating on breathing evenly.\n \"I knew I shouldn\u0027t have told you that.\"\n He shook his head slowly. \"No. I\u0027m glad you did. Thank you.\" He kissed the top of my head, and then he sighed. \"I\u0027ll be good now.\"\n I looked up, and he was smiling.\n \"So you\u0027re going to get married, huh?\"\n \"We don\u0027t have to talk about that.\"\n \"I\u0027d like to know some of the details. I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ll talk to you again.\"\n I had to wait for a minute before I could speak. When I was pretty sure that my voice wouldn\u0027t break, I answered his question.\n \"It\u0027s not really my idea . . . but, yes. It means a lot to him. I figure, why not?\"\n Jake nodded. \"That\u0027s true. It\u0027s not such a big thing - in comparison.\"\n His voice was very calm, very practical. I stared at him, curious about how he was managing, and that ruined it. He met my eyes for a second, and then twisted his head away. I waited to speak until his breathing was under control.\n \"Yes. In comparison,\" I agreed.\n \"How long do you have left?\"\n \"That depends on how long it takes Alice to pull a wedding together.\" I suppressed a groan, imagining what Alice would do.\n \"Before or after?\" he asked quietly.\n I knew what he meant. \"After.\"\n He nodded. This was a relief to him. I wondered how many sleepless nights the thought of my graduation had given him.\n \"Are you scared?\" he whispered.\n \"Yes,\" I whispered back.\n \"What are you afraid of?\" I could barely hear his voice now. He stared down at my hands.\n \"Lots of things.\" I worked to make my voice lighter, but I stayed honest. \"I\u0027ve never been much of a masochist, so I\u0027m not looking forward to the pain. And I wish there was some way to keep him away - I don\u0027t want him to suffer with me, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way around it. There\u0027s dealing with Charlie, too, and Ren��e. . . . And then afterward, I hope I\u0027ll be able to control myself soon. Maybe I\u0027ll be such a menace that the pack will have to take me out.\"\n He looked up with a disapproving expression. \"I\u0027d hamstring any one of my brothers who tried.\"\n \"Thanks.\"\n He smiled halfheartedly. Then he frowned. \"But isn\u0027t it more dangerous than that? In all of the stories, they say it\u0027s too hard . . . they lose control . . . people die. . . .\" He gulped.\n \"No, I\u0027m not afraid of that. Silly Jacob - don\u0027t you know better than to believe vampire stories?\"\n He obviously didn\u0027t appreciate my attempt at humor.\n \"Well, anyway, lots to worry about. But worth it, in the end.\"\n He nodded unwillingly, and I knew that he in no way agreed with me.\n I stretched my neck up to whisper in his ear, laying my cheek against his warm skin. \"You know I love you.\"\n \"I know,\" he breathed, his arm tightening automatically around my waist. \"You know how much I wish it was enough.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I\u0027ll always be waiting in the wings, Bella,\" he promised, lightening his tone and loosening his arm. I pulled away with a dull, dragging sense of loss, feeling the tearing separation as I left a part of me behind, there on the bed next to him. \"You\u0027ll always have that spare option if you want it.\"\n I made an effort to smile. \"Until my heart stops beating.\"\n He grinned back. \"You know, I think maybe I\u0027d still take you - maybe. I guess that depends on how much you stink.\"\n \"Should I come back to see you? Or would you rather I didn\u0027t?\"\n \"I\u0027ll think it through and get back to you,\" he said. \"I might need the company to keep from going crazy. The vampire surgeon extraordinaire says I can\u0027t phase until he gives the okay - it might mess up the way the bones are set.\" Jacob made a face.\n \"Be good and do what Carlisle tells you to do. You\u0027ll get well faster.\"\n \"Sure, sure.\"\n \"I wonder when it will happen,\" I said. \"When the right girl is going to catch your eye.\"\n \"Don\u0027t get your hopes up, Bella.\" Jacob\u0027s voice was abruptly sour. \"Though I\u0027m sure it would be a relief for you.\"\n \"Maybe, maybe not. I probably won\u0027t think she\u0027s good enough for you. I wonder how jealous I\u0027ll be.\"\n \"That part might be kind of fun,\" he admitted.\n \"Let me know if you want me to come back, and I\u0027ll be here,\" I promised.\n With a sigh, he turned his cheek toward me.\n I leaned in and kissed his face softly. \"Love you, Jacob.\"\n He laughed lightly. \"Love you more.\"\n He watched me walk out of his room with an unfathomable expression in his black eyes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-27.html","bookId":2025,"book":{"id":2025,"title":"The Twilight Saga 3: Eclipse (Twilight #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Readers captivated by Twilight and New Moon will eagerly devour the paperback edition Eclipse, the third book in Stephenie Meyer\u0027s riveting vampire love saga.
