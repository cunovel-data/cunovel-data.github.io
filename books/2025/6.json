Isn\u0027t it getting any better?\"\\n\\n His warm hand curled around mine. \"\u0027S not so bad,\" he said, but he wouldn\u0027t meet my eyes.\\n\\n He walked slowly back to the driftwood bench, staring at the rainbow-colored pebbles, and pulling me along at his side. I sat back down on our tree, but he sat on the wet, rocky ground rather than next to me. I wondered if it was so that he could hide his face more easily. He kept my hand.\\n\\n I started babbling to fillthe silence. \"It\u0027s been so long since I was here. I\u0027ve probably missed a ton of things. How are Sam and Emily? And Embry? Did Quil -?\"\\n\\n I broke off mid-sentence, remembering that Jacob\u0027s friend Quil had been a sensitive subject.\\n\\n \"Ah, Quil,\" Jacob sighed.\\n\\n So then it must have happened - Quil must have joined the pack.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I mumbled.\\n\\n To my surprise, Jacob snorted. \"Don\u0027t say that to him.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Quil\u0027s not looking for pity. Just the opposite - he\u0027s jazzed. Totally thrilled.\"\\n\\n This made no sense to me. All the other wolves had been so depressed at the idea of their friend sharing their fate. \"Huh?\"\\n\\n Jacob tilted his head back to look at me. He smiled and rolled his eyes.\\n\\n \"Quil thinks it\u0027s the coolest thing that\u0027s ever happened to him. Part of it is finally knowing what\u0027s going on. And he\u0027s excited to have his friends back - to be part of the \u0027in crowd.\u0027\" Jacob snorted again. \"Shouldn\u0027t be surprised, I guess. It\u0027s so Quil.\"\\n\\n \"He likes it?\"\\n\\n \"Honestly . . . most of them do,\" Jacob admitted slowly. \"There are definitely good sides to this - the speed, the freedom, the strength . . . the sense of - of family. . . . Sam and I are the only ones who ever felt really bitter. And Sam got past that a long time ago. So I\u0027m the crybaby now.\" Jacob laughed at himself.\\n\\n There were so many things I wanted to know. \"Why are you and Sam different? What happened to Sam anyway? What\u0027s his problem?\" The questions tumbled out without room to answer them, and Jacob laughed again.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a long story.\"\\n\\n \"I told you a long story. Besides, I\u0027m not in any hurry to get back,\" I said, and then I grimaced as I thought of the trouble I would be in.\\n\\n He looked up at me swiftly, hearing the double edge in my words. \"Will he be mad at you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I admitted. \"He really hates it when I do things he considers . . . risky.\"\\n\\n \"Like hanging out with werewolves.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n Jacob shrugged. \"So don\u0027t go back. I\u0027ll sleep on the couch.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a great idea,\" I grumbled. \"Because then he would come looking for me.\"\\n\\n Jacob stiffened, and then smiled bleakly. \"Would he?\"\\n\\n \"If he was afraid I was hurt or something - probably.\"\\n\\n \"My idea\u0027s sounding better all the time.\"\\n\\n \"Please, Jake. That really bugs me.\"\\n\\n \"What does?\"\\n\\n \"That you two are so ready to kill each other!\" I complained. \"It makes me crazy. Why can\u0027t you both just be civilized?\"\\n\\n \"Is he ready to kill me?\" Jacob asked with a grim smile, unconcerned by my anger.\\n\\n \"Not like you seem to be!\" I realized I was yelling. \"At least he can be a grown-up about this. He knows that hurting you would hurt me - and so he never would. You don\u0027t seem to care about that at all!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, right,\" Jacob muttered. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s quite the pacifist.\"\\n\\n \"Ugh!\" I ripped my hand out of his and shoved his head away. Then I pulled my knees up to my chest and wrapped my arms tightly around them.\\n\\n I glared out toward the horizon, fuming.\\n\\n Jacob was quiet for a few minutes. Finally, he got up off the ground and sat beside me, putting his arm around my shoulders. I shook it off.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" he said quietly. \"I\u0027ll try to behave myself.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n \"Do you still want to hear about Sam?\" he offered.\\n\\n I shrugged.\\n\\n \"Like I said, it\u0027s a long story. And very . . . strange. There\u0027re so many strange things about this new life. I haven\u0027t had time to tell you the half of it. And this thing with Sam - well, I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll even be able to explain it right.\"\\n\\n His words pricked my curiosity in spite of my irritation.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m listening,\" I said stiffly.\\n\\n Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the side of his face pull up in a smile.\\n\\n \"Sam had it so much harder than the rest of us. Because he was the first, and he was alone, and he didn\u0027t have anyone to tell him what was happening. Sam\u0027s grandfather died before he was born, and his father has never been around. There was no one there to recognize the signs. The first time it happened - the first time he phased - he thought he\u0027d gone insane. It took him two weeks to calm down enough to change back.\\n\\n \"This was before you came to Forks, so you wouldn\u0027t remember. Sam\u0027s mother and Leah Clearwater had the forest rangers searching for him, the police. People thought there had been an accident or something. . . .\"\\n\\n \"Leah?\" I asked, surprised. Leah was Harry\u0027s daughter. Hearing her name sent an automatic surge of pity through me. Harry Clearwater, Charlie\u0027s life-long friend, had died of a heart attack this past spring.\\n\\n His voice changed, became heavier. \"Yeah. Leah and Sam were high school sweethearts. They started dating when she was just a freshman. She was frantic when he disappeared.\"\\n\\n \"But he and Emily -\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get to that - it\u0027s part of the story,\" he said. He inhaled slowly, and then exhaled in a gust.\\n\\n I supposed it was silly for me to imagine that Sam had never loved anyone before Emily. Most people fall in and out of love many times in their lives. It was just that I\u0027d seen Sam with Emily, and I couldn\u0027t imagine him with someone else. The way he looked at her . . . well, it reminded me of a look I\u0027d seen sometimes in Edward\u0027s eyes - when he was looking at me.\\n\\n \"Sam came back,\" Jacob said, \"but he wouldn\u0027t talk to anyone about where he\u0027d been. Rumors flew - that he was up to no good, mostly. And then Sam happened to run in to Quil\u0027s grandfather one afternoon when Old Quil Ateara came to visit Mrs. Uley. Sam shook his hand. Old Quil just about had a stroke.\" Jacob paused to laugh.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n Jacob put his hand on my cheek and pulled my face around to look at him - he was leaning toward me, his face was just a few inches away. His palm burned my skin, like he had a fever.\\n\\n \"Oh, right,\" I said. It was uncomfortable, having my face so close to his with his hand hot against my skin. \"Sam was running a temperature.\"\\n\\n Jacob laughed again. \"Sam\u0027s hand felt like he\u0027d left it sitting on a hot stovetop.\"\\n\\n He was so close, I could feel his warm breath. I reached up casually, to take his hand away and free my face, but wound my fingers through his so that I wouldn\u0027t hurt his feelings. He smiled and leaned back, undeceived by my attempt at nonchalance.\\n\\n \"So Mr. Ateara went straight to the other elders,\" Jacob went on. \"They were the only ones left who still knew, who remembered. Mr. Ateara, Billy, and Harry had actually seen their grandfathers make the change.\\n\\n When Old Quil told them, they met with Sam secretly and explained. \"It was easier when he understood - when he wasn\u0027t alone anymore. They knew he wouldn\u0027t be the only\\n\\n one affected by the Cullens\u0027 return\" - he pronounced the name with unconscious bitterness - \"but no one else was old enough. So Sam waited for the rest of us to join him. . . .\"\\n\\n \"The Cullens had no idea,\" I said in a whisper. \"They didn\u0027t think that werewolves still existed here. They didn\u0027t know that coming here would change you.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t change the fact that it did.\"\\n\\n \"Remind me not to get on your bad side.\"\\n\\n \"You think I should be as forgiving as you are? We can\u0027t all be saints and martyrs.\"\\n\\n \"Grow up, Jacob.\"\\n\\n \"I wish I could,\" he murmured quietly.\\n\\n I stared at him, trying to make sense of his response. \"What?\"\\n\\n Jacob chuckled. \"One of those many strange things I mentioned.\"\\n\\n \"You . . . can\u0027t . . . grow up?\" I said blankly. \"You\u0027re what? Not . . . aging? Is that a joke?\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\" He popped his lips on the P.\\n\\n I felt blood flood my face. Tears - tears of rage - filled my eyes. My teeth mashed together with an audible grinding sound.\\n\\n \"Bella? What did I say?\"\\n\\n I was on my feet again, my hands balled up into fists, my whole frame shaking.\\n\\n \"You. Are. Not. Aging,\" I growled through my teeth.\\n\\n Jacob tugged my arm gently, trying to make me sit. \"None of us are. What\u0027s wrong with you?\"\\n\\n \"Am I the only one who has to get old? I get older every stinking day!\" I nearly shrieked, throwing my hands in the air. Some little part of me recognized that I was throwing a Charlie-esque fit, but that rational part was greatly overshadowed by the irrational part. \"Damn it! What kind of world is this? Where\u0027s the justice?\"\\n\\n \"Take it easy, Bella.\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Jacob. Just shut up! This is so unfair!\"\\n\\n \"Did you seriously just stamp your foot? I thought girls only did that on TV.\"\\n\\n I growled unimpressively.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not as bad as you seem to think it is. Sit down and I\u0027ll explain.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll stand.\"\\n\\n He rolled his eyes. \"Okay. Whatever you want. But listen, I will get older . . . someday.\"\\n\\n \"Explain.\"\\n\\n He patted the tree. I glowered for a second, but then sat; my temper had burned out as suddenly as it had flared and I\u0027d calmed down enough to realize that I was making a fool of myself.\\n\\n \"When we get enough control to quit . . . ,\" Jacob said. \"When we stop phasing for a solid length of time, we age again. It\u0027s not easy.\" He shook his head, abruptly doubtful. \"It\u0027s gonna take a really long time to learn that kind of restraint, I think. Even Sam\u0027s not there yet. \u0027Course it doesn\u0027t help that there\u0027s a huge coven of vampires right down the road. We can\u0027t even think about quitting when the tribe needs protectors. But you shouldn\u0027t get all bent out of shape about it, anyway, because I\u0027m already older than you, physically at least.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"Look at me, Bells. Do I look sixteen?\"\\n\\n I glanced up and down his mammoth frame, trying to be unbiased. \"Not exactly, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Not at all. Because we reach full growth inside of a few months when the werewolf gene gets triggered. It\u0027s one hell of a growth spurt.\" He made a face. \"Physically, I\u0027m probably twenty-five or something. So there\u0027s no need for you to freak out about being too old for me for at least another seven years.\"\\n\\n Twenty-five or something. The idea messed with my head. But I remembered that growth spurt - I remembered watching him shoot up and fill out right before my eyes. I remembered how he would look different from one day to the next. . . . I shook my head, feeling dizzy.\\n\\n \"So, did you want to hear about Sam, or did you want to scream at me some more for things that are out of my control?\"\\n\\n I took a deep breath. \"Sorry. Age is a touchy subject for me. That hit a nerve.\"\\n\\n Jacob\u0027s eyes tightened, and he looked as if he were trying to decide how to word something.\\n\\n Since I didn\u0027t want to talk about the truly touchy stuff - my plans for the future, or treaties that might be broken by said plans, I prompted him. \"So once Sam understood what was going on, once he had Billy and Harry and Mr. Ateara, you said it wasn\u0027t so hard anymore. And, like you also said, there are the cool parts. . . .\" I hesitated briefly. \"Why does Sam hate them so much? Why does he wish I would hate them?\"\\n\\n Jacob sighed. \"This is the really weird part.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a pro at weird.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know.\" He grinned before he continued. \"So, you\u0027re right. Sam knew what was going on, and everything was almost okay. In most ways, his life was back to, well, not normal. But better.\" Then Jacob\u0027s expression tightened, like something painful was coming. \"Sam couldn\u0027t tell Leah. We aren\u0027t supposed to tell anyone who doesn\u0027t have to know. And it wasn\u0027t really safe for him to be around her - but he cheated, just like I did with you. Leah was furious that he wouldn\u0027t tell her what was going on - where he\u0027d been, where he went at night, why he was always so exhausted - but they were working it out. They were trying. They really loved each other.\"\\n\\n \"Did she find out? Is that what happened?\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"No, that wasn\u0027t the problem. Her cousin, Emily Young, came down from the Makah reservation to visit her one weekend.\"\\n\\n I gasped. \"Emily is Leah\u0027s cousin?\"\\n\\n \"Second cousins. They\u0027re close, though. They were like sisters when they were kids.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s . . . horrible. How could Sam . . . ?\" I trailed off, shaking my head.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t judge him just yet. Did anyone ever tell you . . . Have you ever heard of imprinting?\"\\n\\n \"Imprinting?\" I repeated the unfamiliar word. \"No. What\u0027s that mean?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s one of those bizarre things we have to deal with. It doesn\u0027t happen to everyone. In fact, it\u0027s the rare exception, not the rule. Sam had heard all the stories by then, the stories we all used to think were legends. He\u0027d heard of imprinting, but he never dreamed . . .\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\" I prodded.\\n\\n Jacob\u0027s eyes strayed to the ocean. \"Sam did love Leah. But when he saw Emily, that didn\u0027t matter anymore. Sometimes . . . we don\u0027t exactly know why . . . we find our mates that way.\" His eyes flashed back to me, his face reddening. \"I mean . . . our soul mates.\"\\n\\n \"What way? Love at first sight?\" I snickered.\\n\\n Jacob wasn\u0027t smiling. His dark eyes were critical of my reaction. \"It\u0027s a little bit more powerful than that. More absolute.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" I muttered. \"You\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I am.\"\\n\\n \"Love at first sight? But more powerful?\" My voice still sounded dubious, and he could hear that.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not easy to explain. It doesn\u0027t matter, anyway.\" He shrugged indifferently. \"You wanted to know what happened to Sam to make him hate the vampires for changing him, to make him hate himself. And that\u0027s what happened. He broke Leah\u0027s heart. He went back on every promise he\u0027d ever made her. Every day he has to see the accusation in her eyes, and know that she\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n He stopped talking abruptly, as if he\u0027d said something he hadn\u0027t meant to.\\n\\n \"How did Emily deal with this? If she was so close to Leah . . . ?\" Sam and Emily were utterly right together, two puzzle pieces, shaped for each other exactly. Still . . . how had Emily gotten past the fact that he\u0027d belonged to someone else? Her sister, almost.\\n\\n \"She was real angry, in the beginning. But it\u0027s hard to resist that level of commitment and adoration.\" Jacob sighed. \"And then, Sam could tell her everything. There are no rules that can bind you when you find your other half. You know how she got hurt?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" The story in Forks was that she was mauled by a bear, but I was in on the secret.\\n\\n Werewolves are unstable, Edward had said. The people near them get hurt.\\n\\n \"Well, weirdly enough, that was sort of how they resolved things. Sam was so horrified, so sickened by himself, so full of hate for what he\u0027d done. . . . He would have thrown himself under a bus if it would have made her feel better. He might have anyway, just to escape what he\u0027d done. He was shattered. . . . Then, somehow, she was the one comforting him, and after that. . . .\"\\n\\n Jacob didn\u0027t finish his thought, and I sensed the story had gotten too personal to share.\\n\\n \"Poor Emily,\" I whispered. \"Poor Sam. Poor Leah. . . .\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Leah got the worst end of the stick,\" he agreed. \"She puts on a brave face. She\u0027s going to be a bridesmaid.\"\\n\\n I gazed away, toward the jagged rocks that rose from the ocean like stubby broken-off fingers on the south rim of the harbor, while I tried to make sense of it all. I could feel his eyes on my face, waiting for me to say something.\\n\\n \"Did it happen to you?\" I finally asked, still looking away. \"This love-at-first-sight thing?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he answered briskly. \"Sam and Jared are the only ones.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm,\" I said, trying to sound only politely interested. I was relieved, and I tried to explain my reaction to myself. I decided I was just glad he didn\u0027t claim there was some mystical, wolfy connection between the two of us. Our relationship was confusing enough as it was. I didn\u0027t need any more of the supernatural than I already had to deal with.\\n\\n He was quiet, too, and the silence felt a little awkward. My intuition told me that I didn\u0027t want to hear what he was thinking.\\n\\n \"How did that work out for Jared?\" I asked to break the silence.\\n\\n \"No drama there. It was just a girl he\u0027d sat next to in school every day for a year and never looked at twice. And then, after he changed, he saw her again and never looked away. Kim was thrilled. She\u0027d had a huge crush on him. She\u0027d had his last name tacked on to the end of hers all over in her diary.\" He laughed mockingly.\\n\\n I frowned. \"Did Jared tell you that? He shouldn\u0027t have.\"\\n\\n Jacob bit his lip. \"I guess I shouldn\u0027t laugh. It was funny, though.\"\\n\\n \"Some soul mate.\"\\n\\n He sighed. \"Jared didn\u0027t tell us anything on purpose. I already told you this part, remember?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah. You can hear each other\u0027s thoughts, but only when you\u0027re wolves, right?\"\\n\\n \"Right. Just like your bloodsucker.\" He glowered.\\n\\n \"Edward,\" I corrected.\\n\\n \"Sure, sure. That\u0027s how come I know so much about how Sam felt. It\u0027s not like he would have told us all that if he\u0027d had a choice. Actually, that\u0027s something we all hate.\" The bitterness was abruptly harsh in his voice. \"It\u0027s awful. No privacy, no secrets. Everything you\u0027re ashamed of, laid out for everyone to see.\" He shuddered.\\n\\n \"It sounds horrible,\" I whispered.\\n\\n \"It is sometimes helpful when we need to coordinate,\" he said grudgingly. \"Once in a blue moon, when some bloodsucker crosses into our territory. Laurent was fun. And if the Cullens hadn\u0027t gotten in our way last Saturday . . . ugh!\" he groaned. \"We could have had her!\" His fists clenched into angry balls.\\n\\n I flinched. As much as I worried about Jasper or Emmett getting hurt, it was nothing like the panic I felt at the idea of Jacob going up against Victoria. Emmett and Jasper were the closest thing to indestructible I could imagine. Jacob was still warm, still comparatively human. Mortal. I thought of Jacob facing Victoria, her brilliant hair blowing around her oddly feline face . . . and shuddered.\\n\\n Jacob looked up at me with a curious expression. \"But isn\u0027t it like that for you all the time? Having him in your head?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no. Edward\u0027s never in my head. He only wishes.\"\\n\\n Jacob\u0027s expression became confused.\\n\\n \"He can\u0027t hear me,\" I explained, my voice a tiny bit smug from old habit. \"I\u0027m the only one like that, for him. We don\u0027t know why he can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Weird,\" Jacob said.\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" The smugness faded. \"It probably means there\u0027s something wrong with my brain,\" I admitted.\\n\\n \"I already knew there was something wrong with your brain,\" Jacob muttered.\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n The sun broke through the clouds suddenly, a surprise I hadn\u0027t been expecting, and I had to narrow my eyes against the glare off the water. Everything changed color - the waves turned from gray to blue, the trees from dull olive to brilliant jade, and the rainbow-hued pebbles glittered like jewels.\\n\\n We squinted for a moment, letting our eyes adjust. There were no sounds besides the hollow roar of the waves that echoed from every side of the sheltered harbor, the soft grinding of the stones against each other under the water\u0027s movement, and the cry of gulls high overhead. It was very peaceful.\\n\\n Jacob settled closer to me, so that he was leaning against my arm. He was so warm. After a minute of this, I shrugged out of my rain jacket. He made a little sound of contentment in the back of his throat, and rested his cheek on the top of my head. I could feel the sun heat my skin - thought it was not quite as warm as Jacob - and I wondered idly how long it would take me to burn.\\n\\n Absentmindedly, I twisted my right hand to the side, and watched the sunlight glitter subtly off the scar James had left there.\\n\\n \"What are you thinking about?\" he murmured.\\n\\n \"The sun.\"\\n\\n \"Mmm. It\u0027s nice.\"\\n\\n \"What are you thinking about?\" I asked.\\n\\n He chuckled to himself. \"I was remembering that moronic movie you took me to. And Mike Newton puking all over everything.\"\\n\\n I laughed, too, surprised by how time had changed the memory. It used to be one of stress, of confusion. So much had changed that night. . . . And now I could laugh. It was the last night Jacob and I had had before he\u0027d learned the truth about his heritage. The last human memory. An oddly pleasant memory now.\\n\\n \"I miss that,\" Jacob said. \"The way it used to be so easy . . . uncomplicated. I\u0027m glad I\u0027ve got a good memory.\" He sighed.\\n\\n He felt the sudden tension in my body as his words triggered a memory of my own.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"About that good memory of yours . . .\" I pulled away from him so that I could read his face. At the moment, it was confused. \"Do you mind telling me what you were doing Monday morning? You were thinking something that bothered Edward.\" Bothered wasn\u0027t quite the word for it, but I wanted an answer, so I thought it was best not to start out too severely.\\n\\n Jacob\u0027s face brightened with understanding, and he laughed. \"I was just thinking about you. Didn\u0027t like that much, did he?\"\\n\\n \"Me? What about me?\"\\n\\n Jacob laughed, with a harder edge this time. \"I was remembering the way you looked that night Sam found you - I\u0027ve seen it in his head, and it\u0027s like I was there; that memory has always haunted Sam, you know. And then I remembered how you looked the first time you came to my place. I bet you don\u0027t even realize what a mess you were then, Bella. It was weeks before you started to look human again. And I remembered how you always used to have your arms wrapped around yourself, trying to hold yourself together. . . .\" Jacob winced, and then shook his head. \"It\u0027s hard for me to remember how sad you were, and it wasn\u0027t my fault. So I figured it would be harder for him. And I thought he ought to get a look at what he\u0027d done.\"\\n\\n I smacked his shoulder. It hurt my hand. \"Jacob Black, don\u0027t you ever do that again! Promise me you won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"No way. I haven\u0027t had that much fun in months.\"\\n\\n \"So help me, Jake -\"\\n\\n \"Oh, get a grip, Bella. When am I ever going to see him again? Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\\n\\n I got to my feet, and he caught my hand as I started to walk away. I tried to tug free.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m leaving, Jacob.\"\\n\\n \"No, don\u0027t go yet,\" he protested, his hand tightening around mine. \"I\u0027m sorry. And . . . okay, I won\u0027t do it again. Promise.\"\\n\\n I sighed. \"Thanks, Jake.\"\\n\\n \"Come on, we\u0027ll go back to my house,\" he said eagerly.\\n\\n \"Actually, I think I really do need to go. Angela Weber is expecting me, and I know Alice is worried. I don\u0027t want to upset her too much.\"\\n\\n \"But you just got here!\"\\n\\n \"It feels that way,\" I agreed. I glared up at the sun, somehow already directly overhead. How had the time passed so quickly?\\n\\n His eyebrows pulled down over his eyes. \"I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ll see you again,\" he said in a hurt voice.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll come back the next time he\u0027s away,\" I promised impulsively.\\n\\n \"Away?\" Jacob rolled his eyes. \"That\u0027s a nice way to describe what he\u0027s doing. Disgusting parasites.\"\\n\\n \"If you can\u0027t be nice, I won\u0027t come back at all!\" I threatened, trying to pull my hand free. He refused to let go.\\n\\n \"Aw, don\u0027t be mad,\" he said, grinning. \"Knee-jerk reaction.\"\\n\\n \"If I\u0027m going to try to come back again, you\u0027re going to have to get something straight, okay?\"\\n\\n He waited.\\n\\n \"See,\" I explained. \"I don\u0027t care who\u0027s a vampire and who\u0027s a werewolf. That\u0027s irrelevant. You are Jacob, and he is Edward, and I am Bella. And nothing else matters.\"\\n\\n His eyes narrowed slightly. \"But I am a werewolf,\" he said unwillingly. \"And he is a vampire,\" he added with obvious revulsion.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m a Virgo!\" I shouted, exasperated.\\n\\n He raised his eyebrows, measuring my expression with curious eyes. Finally, he shrugged.\\n\\n \"If you can really see it that way . . .\"\\n\\n \"I can. I do.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Just Bella and Jacob. None of those freaky Virgos here.\" He smiled at me, the warm, familiar smile that I had missed so much. I felt the answering smile spread across my face.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve really missed you, Jake,\" I admitted impulsively.\\n\\n \"Me, too,\" his smile widened.
