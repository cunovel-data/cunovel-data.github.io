{"id":107896,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I FELT ODDLY BUOYANT AS I WALKED FROM SPANISH toward the cafeteria, and it wasn\u0027t just because I was holding hands with the most perfect person on the planet, though that was certainly part of it.\n Maybe it was the knowledge that my sentence was served and I was a free woman again.\n Or maybe it wasn\u0027t anything to do with me specifically. Maybe it was the atmosphere of freedom that hung over the entire campus. School was winding down, and, for the senior class especially, there was a perceptible thrill in the air.\n Freedom was so close it was touchable, taste-able. Signs of it were everywhere. Posters crowded together on the cafeteria walls, and the trashcans wore a colorful skirt of spilled-over fliers: reminders to buy yearbooks, class rings, and announcements; deadlines to order graduation gowns, hats, and tassels; neon- bright sales pitches - the juniors campaigning for class office; ominous, rose-wreathed advertisements for this year\u0027s prom. The big dance was this coming weekend, but I had an ironclad promise from Edward that I would not be subjected to that again. After all, I\u0027d already had that human experience.\n No, it must be my personal freedom that lightened me today. The ending of the school year did not give me the pleasure it seemed to give the other students. Actually, I felt nervous to the point of nausea whenever I thought of it. I tried to not think of it.\n But it was hard to escape such an omnipresent topic as graduation.\n \"Have you sent your announcements, yet?\" Angela asked when Edward and I sat down at our table. She had her light brown hair pulled back into a sloppy ponytail instead of her usual smooth hairdo, and there was a slightly frantic look about her eyes.\n Alice and Ben were already there, too, on either side of Angela. Ben was intent over a comic book, his glasses sliding down his narrow nose. Alice was scrutinizing my boring jeans-and-a-t-shirt outfit in a way that made me self-conscious. Probably plotting another makeover. I sighed. My indifferent attitude to fashion was a constant thorn in her side. If I\u0027d allow it, she\u0027d love to dress me every day - perhaps several times a day - like some oversized three-dimensional paper doll.\n \"No,\" I answered Angela. \"There\u0027s no point, really. Ren��e knows when I\u0027m graduating. Who else is there?\"\n \"How about you, Alice?\"\n Alice smiled. \"All done.\"\n \"Lucky you.\" Angela sighed. \"My mother has a thousand cousins and she expects me to hand-address one to everybody. I\u0027m going to get carpal tunnel. I can\u0027t put it off any longer and I\u0027m just dreading it.\" \"I\u0027ll help you,\" I volunteered. \"If you don\u0027t mind my awful handwriting.\"\n Charlie would like that. From the corner of my eye, I saw Edward smile. He must like that, too - me fulfilling Charlie\u0027s conditions without involving werewolves.\n Angela looked relieved. \"That\u0027s so nice of you. I\u0027ll come over any time you want.\"\n \"Actually, I\u0027d rather go to your house if that\u0027s okay - I\u0027m sick of mine. Charlie un-grounded me last night.\" I grinned as I announced my good news.\n \"Really?\" Angela asked, mild excitement lighting her always-gentle brown eyes. \"I thought you said you were in for life.\"\n \"I\u0027m more surprised than you are. I was sure I would at least have finished high school before he set me free.\"\n \"Well, this is great, Bella! We\u0027ll have to go out to celebrate.\"\n \"You have no idea how good that sounds.\"\n \"What should we do?\" Alice mused, her face lighting up at the possibilities. Alice\u0027s ideas were usually a little grandiose for me, and I could see it in her eyes now - the tendency to take things too far kicking into action.\n \"Whatever you\u0027re thinking, Alice, I doubt I\u0027m that free.\"\n \"Free is free, right?\" she insisted.\n \"I\u0027m sure I still have boundaries - like the continental U.S., for example.\"\n Angela and Ben laughed, but Alice grimaced in real disappointment.\n \"So what are we doing tonight?\" she persisted.\n \"Nothing. Look, let\u0027s give it a couple of days to make sure he wasn\u0027t joking. It\u0027s a school night, anyway.\" \"We\u0027ll celebrate this weekend, then.\" Alice\u0027s enthusiasm was impossible to repress.\n \"Sure,\" I said, hoping to placate her. I knew I wasn\u0027t going to do anything too outlandish; it would be safer to take it slow with Charlie. Give him a chance to appreciate how trustworthy and mature I was before I asked for any favors.\n Angela and Alice started talking about options; Ben joined the conversation, setting his comics aside. My attention drifted. I was surprised to find that the subject of my freedom was suddenly not as gratifying as it had been just a moment ago. While they discussed things to do in Port Angeles or maybe Hoquiam, I began to feel disgruntled.\n It didn\u0027t take long to determine where my restlessness stemmed from.\n Ever since I\u0027d said goodbye to Jacob Black in the forest outside my home, I\u0027d been plagued by a persistent, uncomfortable intrusion of a specific mental picture. It popped into my thoughts at regular intervals like some annoying alarm clock set to sound every half hour, filling my head with the image of Jacob\u0027s face crumpled in pain. This was the last memory I had of him.\n As the disturbing vision struck again, I knew exactly why I was dissatisfied with my liberty. Because it was incomplete.\n Sure, I was free to go to anywhere I wanted - except La Push; free to do anything I wanted - except see Jacob. I frowned at the table. There had to be some kind of middle ground.\n \"Alice? Alice!\"\n Angela\u0027s voice yanked me from my reverie. She was waving her hand back and forth in front of Alice\u0027s blank, staring face. Alice\u0027s expression was something I recognized - an expression that sent an automatic shock of panic through my body. The vacant look in her eyes told me that she was seeing something very different from the mundane lunchroom scene that surrounded us, but something that was every bit as real in its own way. Something that was coming, something that would happen soon. I felt the blood slither from my face.\n Then Edward laughed, a very natural, relaxed sound. Angela and Ben looked toward him, but my eyes were locked on Alice. She jumped suddenly, as if someone had kicked her under the table.\n \"Is it naptime already, Alice?\" Edward teased.\n Alice was herself again. \"Sorry, I was daydreaming, I guess.\"\n \"Daydreaming\u0027s better than facing two more hours of school,\" Ben said.\n Alice threw herself back into the conversation with more animation than before - just a little bit too much. Once I saw her eyes lock with Edward\u0027s, only for a moment, and then she looked back to Angela before anyone else noticed. Edward was quiet, playing absentmindedly with a strand of my hair.\n I waited anxiously for a chance to ask Edward what Alice had seen in her vision, but the afternoon passed without one minute of alone time.\n It felt odd to me, almost deliberate. After lunch, Edward slowed his pace to match Ben\u0027s, talking about some assignment I knew he\u0027d already finished. Then there was always someone else there between classes, though we usually had a few minutes to ourselves. When the final bell rang, Edward struck up a conversation with Mike Newton of all people, falling into step beside him as Mike headed for the parking lot. I trailed behind, letting Edward tow me along.\n I listened, confused, while Mike answered Edward\u0027s unusually friendly queries. It seemed Mike was having car troubles.\n \". . . but I just replaced the battery,\" Mike was saying. His eyes darted ahead and then back to Edward warily. Mystified, just like I was.\n \"Perhaps it\u0027s the cables?\" Edward offered.\n \"Maybe. I really don\u0027t know anything about cars,\" Mike admitted. \"I need to have someone look at it, but I can\u0027t afford to take it to Dowling\u0027s.\"\n I opened my mouth to suggest my mechanic, and then snapped it shut again. My mechanic was busy these days - busy running around as a giant wolf.\n \"I know a few things - I could take a look, if you like,\" Edward offered. \"Just let me drop Alice and Bella at home.\"\n Mike and I both stared at Edward with our mouths hanging open. \"Er . . . thanks,\" Mike mumbled when he recovered. \"But I have to get to work. Maybe some other time.\"\n \"Absolutely.\"\n \"See ya.\" Mike climbed into his car, shaking his head in disbelief.\n Edward\u0027s Volvo, with Alice already inside, was just two cars away.\n \"What was that about?\" I muttered as Edward held the passenger door for me.\n \"Just being helpful,\" Edward answered.\n And then Alice, waiting in the backseat, was babbling at top speed.\n \"You\u0027re really not that good a mechanic, Edward. Maybe you should have Rosalie take a look at it tonight, just so you look good if Mike decides to let you help, you know. Not that it wouldn\u0027t be fun to watch his face if Rosalie showed up to help. But since Rosalie is supposed to be across the country attending college, I guess that\u0027s not the best idea. Too bad. Though I suppose, for Mike\u0027s car, you\u0027ll do. It\u0027s only within the finer tunings of a good Italian sports car that you\u0027re out of your depth. And speaking of Italy and sports cars that I stole there, you still owe me a yellow Porsche. I don\u0027t know that I want to wait for Christmas. . . .\"\n I stopped listening after a minute, letting her quick voice become just a hum in the background as I settled into my patient mode.\n It looked to me like Edward was trying to avoid my questions. Fine. He would have to be alone with me soon enough. It was only a matter of time.\n Edward seemed to realize that, too. He dropped Alice at the mouth of the Cullens\u0027 drive as usual, though by this point I half expected him to drive her to the door and walk her in.\n As she got out, Alice threw a sharp look at his face. Edward seemed completely at ease.\n \"See you later,\" he said. And then, ever so slightly, he nodded.\n Alice turned to disappear into the trees.\n He was quiet as he turned the car around and headed back to Forks. I waited, wondering if he would bring it up himself. He didn\u0027t, and this made me tense. What had Alice seen today at lunch? Something he didn\u0027t want to tell me, and I tried to think of a reason why he would keep secrets. Maybe it would be better to prepare myself before I asked. I didn\u0027t want to freak out and have him think I couldn\u0027t handle it, whatever it was.\n So we were both silent until we got to back to Charlie\u0027s house.\n \"Light homework load tonight,\" he commented.\n \"Mmm,\" I assented.\n \"Do you suppose I\u0027m allowed inside again?\"\n \"Charlie didn\u0027t throw a fit when you picked me up for school.\"\n But I was sure Charlie was going to turn sulky fast when he got home and found Edward here. Maybe I should make something extra-special for dinner.\n Inside, I headed up the stairs, and Edward followed. He lounged on my bed and gazed out the window, seeming oblivious to my edginess.\n I stowed my bag and turned the computer on. There was an unanswered e-mail from my mom to attend to, and she got panicky when I took too long. I drummed my fingers as I waited for my decrepit computer to wheeze awake; they snapped against the desk, staccato and anxious.\n And then his fingers were on mine, holding them still.\n \"Are we a little impatient today?\" he murmured.\n I looked up, intending to make a sarcastic remark, but his face was closer than I\u0027d expected. His golden eyes were smoldering, just inches away, and his breath was cool against my open lips. I could taste his scent on my tongue.\n I couldn\u0027t remember the witty response I\u0027d been about to make. I couldn\u0027t remember my name.\n He didn\u0027t give me a chance to recover.\n If I had my way, I would spend the majority of my time kissing Edward. There wasn\u0027t anything I\u0027d experienced in my life that compared to the feeling of his cool lips, marble hard but always so gentle, moving with mine.\n I didn\u0027t often get my way.\n So it surprised me a little when his fingers braided themselves into my hair, securing my face to his. My arms locked behind his neck, and I wished I was stronger - strong enough to keep him prisoner here. One hand slid down my back, pressing me tighter against his stone chest. Even through his sweater, his skin was cold enough to make me shiver - it was a shiver of pleasure, of happiness, but his hands began to loosen in response.\n I knew I had about three seconds before he would sigh and slide me deftly away, saying something about how we\u0027d risked my life enough for one afternoon. Making the most of my last seconds, I crushed myself closer, molding myself to the shape of him. The tip of my tongue traced the curve of his lower lip; it was as flawlessly smooth as if it had been polished, and the taste - He pulled my face away from his, breaking my hold with ease - he probably didn\u0027t even realize that I was using all my strength.\n He chuckled once, a low, throaty sound. His eyes were bright with the excitement he so rigidly disciplined. \"Ah, Bella.\" He sighed.\n \"I\u0027d say I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027m not.\"\n \"And I should feel sorry that you\u0027re not sorry, but I don\u0027t. Maybe I should go sit on the bed.\" I exhaled a little dizzily. \"If you think that\u0027s necessary. . . .\"\n He smiled crookedly and disentangled himself.\n I shook my head a few times, trying to clear it, and turned back to my computer. It was all warmed up and humming now. Well, not as much humming as groaning.\n \"Tell Ren��e I said hello.\"\n \"Sure thing.\"\n I scanned through Ren��e\u0027s e-mail, shaking my head now and then at some of the dippier things she\u0027d done. I was just as entertained and horrified as the first time I\u0027d read this. It was so like my mother to forget exactly how paralyzed she was by heights until she was already strapped to a parachute and a dive instructor.\n I felt a little frustrated with Phil, her husband of almost two years, for allowing that one. I would have taken better care of her. I knew her so much better.\n You have to let them go their own way eventually, I reminded myself. You have to let them have their own life. . . .\n I\u0027d spent most of my life taking care of Ren��e, patiently guiding her away from her craziest plans, good- naturedly enduring the ones I couldn\u0027t talk her out of. I\u0027d always been indulgent with my mom, amused by her, even a little condescending to her. I saw her cornucopia of mistakes and laughed privately to myself. Scatterbrained Ren��e.\n I was a very different person from my mother. Someone thoughtful and cautious. The responsible one, the grown-up. That\u0027s how I saw myself. That was the person I knew. With the blood still pounding inmy head from Edward\u0027s kiss, I couldn\u0027t help but think of my mother\u0027s most life-altering mistake. Silly and romantic, getting married fresh out of high school to a man she barely knew, then producing me a year later. She\u0027d always promised me that she had no regrets, that I was the best gift her life had ever given her. And yet she\u0027d drilled it into me over and over - smart people took marriage seriously. Mature people went to college and started careers before they got deeply involved in a relationship. She knew I would never be as thoughtless and goofy and small-town as she\u0027d been. . . . I gritted my teeth and tried to concentrate as I answered her letter.\n Then I hit her parting line and remembered why I\u0027d neglected to write sooner.\n You haven\u0027t said anything about Jacob in a long time, she\u0027d written. What\u0027s he up to these days? Charlie was prompting her, I was sure.\n I sighed and typed quickly, tucking the answer to her question between two less sensitive paragraphs.\n Jacob is fine, I guess. I don\u0027t see him much; he spends most of his time with a pack of his friends down at La Push these days.\n Smiling wryly to myself, I added Edward\u0027s greeting and hit \"send.\"\n I didn\u0027t realize that Edward was standing silently behind me again until after I\u0027d turned off the computer and shoved away from the desk. I was about to scold him for reading over my shoulder when I realized that he wasn\u0027t paying any attention to me. He was examining a flat black box with wires curling crookedly away from the main square in a way that didn\u0027t look healthy for whatever it was. After a second, I recognized the car stereo Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper had given me for my last birthday. I\u0027d forgotten about the birthday presents hiding under a growing pile of dust on the floor of my closet.\n \"What did you do to this?\" he asked in a horrorstruck voice.\n \"It didn\u0027t want to come out of the dashboard.\"\n \"So you felt the need to torture it?\"\n \"You know how I am with tools. No pain was inflicted intentionally.\"\n He shook his head, his face a mask of faux tragedy. \"You killed it.\"\n I shrugged. \"Oh, well.\"\n \"It would hurt their feelings if they saw this,\" he said. \"I guess it\u0027s a good thing that you\u0027ve been on house arrest. I\u0027ll have to get another one in place before they notice.\"\n \"Thanks, but I don\u0027t need a fancy stereo.\"\n \"It\u0027s not for your sake that I\u0027m going to replace it.\"\n I sighed.\n \"You didn\u0027t get much good out of your birthday presents last year,\" he said in a disgruntled voice.\n Suddenly, he was fanning himself with a stiff rectangle of paper.\n I didn\u0027t answer, for fear my voice would shake. My disastrous eighteenth birthday - with all its far- reaching consequences - wasn\u0027t something I cared to remember, and I was surprised that he would bring it up. He was even more sensitive about it than I was.\n \"Do you realize these are about to expire?\" he asked, holding the paper out to me. It was another present - the voucher for airplane tickets that Esme and Carlisle had given me so that I could visit Ren��e in Florida. I took a deep breath and answered in a flat voice. \"No. I\u0027d forgotten all about them, actually.\"\n His expression was carefully bright and positive; there was no trace of any deep emotion as he continued.\n \"Well, we still have a little time. You\u0027ve been liberated . . . and we have no plans this weekend, as you refuse to go to the prom with me.\" He grinned. \"Why not celebrate your freedom this way?\"\n I gasped. \"By going to Florida?\"\n \"You did say something about the continental U.S. being allowable.\"\n I glared at him, suspicious, trying to understand where this had come from.\n \"Well?\" he demanded. \"Are we going to see Ren��e or not?\"\n \"Charlie will never allow it.\"\n \"Charlie can\u0027t keep you from visiting your mother. She still has primary custody.\"\n \"Nobody has custody of me. I\u0027m an adult.\"\n He flashed a brilliant smile. \"Exactly.\"\n I thought it over for a short minute before deciding that it wasn\u0027t worth the fight. Charlie would be furious - not that I was going to see Ren��e, but that Edward was going with me. Charlie wouldn\u0027t speak to me for months, and I\u0027d probably end up grounded again. It was definitely smarter not to even bring it up. Maybe in a few weeks, as a graduation favor or something.\n But the idea of seeing my mother now, not weeks from now, was hard to resist. It had been so long since I\u0027d seen Ren��e. And even longer since I\u0027d seen her under pleasant circumstances. The last time I\u0027d been with her in Phoenix, I\u0027d spent the whole time in a hospital bed. The last time she\u0027d come here, I\u0027d been more or less catatonic. Not exactly the best memories to leave her with.\n And maybe, if she saw how happy I was with Edward, she would tell Charlie to ease up.\n Edward scrutinized my face while I deliberated.\n I sighed. \"Not this weekend.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to fight with Charlie. Not so soon after he\u0027s forgiven me.\"\n His eyebrows pulled together. \"I think this weekend is perfect,\" he muttered.\n I shook my head. \"Another time.\"\n \"You aren\u0027t the only one who\u0027s been trapped in this house, you know.\" He frowned at me.\n Suspicion returned. This kind of behavior was unlike him. He was always so impossibly selfless; I knew it was making me spoiled.\n \"You can go anywhere you want,\" I pointed out.\n \"The outside world holds no interest for me without you.\"\n I rolled my eyes at the hyperbole.\n \"I\u0027m serious,\" he said.\n \"Let\u0027s take the outside world slowly, all right? For example, we could start with a movie in Port Angeles. . . .\"\n He groaned. \"Never mind. We\u0027ll talk about it later.\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing left to talk about.\"\n He shrugged.\n \"Okay, then, new subject,\" I said. I\u0027d almost forgotten my worries about this afternoon - had that been his intention? \"What did Alice see today at lunch?\"\n My eyes were fixed on his face as I spoke, measuring his reaction.\n His expression was composed; there was only the slightest hardening of his topaz eyes. \"She\u0027s been seeing Jasper in a strange place, somewhere in the southwest, she thinks, near his former . . . family. But he has no conscious intentions to go back.\" He sighed. \"It\u0027s got her worried.\"\n \"Oh.\" That was nothing close to what I\u0027d been expecting. But of course it made sense that Alice would be watching out for Jasper\u0027s future. He was her soul mate, her true other half, though they weren\u0027t as flamboyant about their relationship as Rosalie and Emmett were. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me before?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t realize you\u0027d noticed,\" he said. \"It\u0027s probably nothing important, in any case.\"\n My imagination was sadly out of control. I\u0027d taken a perfectly normal afternoon and twisted it until it looked like Edward was going out of his way to keep things from me. I needed therapy.\n We went downstairs to work on our homework, just in case Charlie showed up early. Edward finished in minutes; I slogged laboriously through my calculus until I decided it was time to fix Charlie\u0027s dinner. Edward helped, making faces every so often at the raw ingredients - human food was mildly repulsive to him. I made stroganoff from Grandma Swan\u0027s recipe, because I was sucking up. It wasn\u0027t one of my favorites, but it would please Charlie.\n Charlie seemed to already be in a good mood when he got home. He didn\u0027t even go out of his way to be rude to Edward. Edward excused himself from eating with us, as usual. The sound of the nightly news drifted from the front room, but I doubted Edward was really watching.\n After forcing down three helpings, Charlie kicked his feet up on the spare chair and folded his hands contentedly across his distended stomach.\n \"That was great, Bells.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad you liked it. How was work?\" He\u0027d been eating with too much concentration for me to make conversation before.\n \"Sort of slow. Well, dead slow really. Mark and I played cards for a good part of the afternoon,\" he admitted with a grin. \"I won, nineteen hands to seven. And then I was on the phone with Billy for a while.\"\n I tried to keep my expression the same. \"How is he?\"\n \"Good, good. His joints are bothering him a little.\"\n \"Oh. That\u0027s too bad.\" \"Yeah. He invited us down to visit this weekend. He was thinking of having the Clearwaters and the Uleys over too. Sort of a playoff party. . . .\"\n \"Huh,\" was my genius response. But what could I say? I knew I wouldn\u0027t be allowed to hit a werewolf party, even with parental supervision. I wondered if Edward would have a problem with Charlie hanging out in La Push. Or would he suppose that, since Charlie was mostly spending time with Billy, who was only human, my father wouldn\u0027t be in danger?\n I got up and piled the dishes together without looking at Charlie. I dumped them into the sink and started the water. Edward appeared silently and grabbed a dishtowel.\n Charlie sighed and gave up for the moment, though I imagined he would revisit the subject when we were alone again. He heaved himself to his feet and headed for the TV, just like every other night. \"Charlie,\" Edward said in a conversational tone.\n Charlie stopped in the middle of his little kitchen. \"Yeah?\"\n \"Did Bella ever tell you that my parents gave her airplane tickets on her last birthday, so that she could visit Ren��e?\"\n I dropped the plate I was scrubbing. It glanced off the counter and clattered noisily to the floor. It didn\u0027t break, but it spattered the room, and all three of us, with soapy water. Charlie didn\u0027t even seem to notice. \"Bella?\" he asked in a stunned voice.\n I kept my eyes on the plate as I retrieved it. \"Yeah, they did.\"\n Charlie swallowed loudly, and then his eyes narrowed as he turned back to Edward. \"No, she never mentioned it.\"\n \"Hmm,\" Edward murmured.\n \"Was there a reason you brought it up?\" Charlie asked in a hard voice.\n Edward shrugged. \"They\u0027re about to expire. I think it might hurt Esme\u0027s feelings if Bella doesn\u0027t use her gift. Not that she\u0027d say anything.\"\n I stared at Edward in disbelief.\n Charlie thought for a minute. \"It\u0027s probably a good idea for you to visit your mom, Bella. She\u0027d love that. I\u0027m surprised you didn\u0027t say anything about this, though.\"\n \"I forgot,\" I admitted.\n He frowned. \"You forgot that someone gave you plane tickets?\"\n \"Mmm,\" I murmured vaguely, and turned back to the sink.\n \"I noticed that you said they\u0027re about to expire, Edward,\" Charlie went on. \"How many tickets did your parents give her?\"\n \"Just one for her . . . and one for me.\"\n The plate I dropped this time landed in the sink, so it didn\u0027t make as much noise. I could easily hear the sharp huff as my father exhaled. The blood rushed into my face, fueled by irritation and chagrin. Why was Edward doing this? I glared at the bubbles in the sink, panicking.\n \"That\u0027s out of the question!\" Charlie was abruptly in a rage, shouting the words.\n \"Why?\" Edward asked, his voice saturated with innocent surprise. \"You just said it was a good idea for her to see her mother.\"\n Charlie ignored him. \"You\u0027re not going anywhere with him, young lady!\" he yelled. I spun around and he was jabbing a finger at me.\n Anger pulsed through me automatically, an instinctive reaction to his tone.\n \"I\u0027m not a child, Dad. And I\u0027m not grounded anymore, remember?\"\n \"Oh yes, you are. Starting now.\"\n \"For what?!\"\n \"Because I said so.\"\n \"Do I need to remind you that I\u0027m a legal adult, Charlie?\"\n \"This is my house - you follow my rules!\"\n My glare turned icy. \"If that\u0027s how you want it. Do you want me to move out tonight? Or can I have a few days to pack?\"\n Charlie\u0027s face went bright red. I instantly felt horrible for playing the move-out card.\n I took a deep breath and tried to make my tone more reasonable. \"I\u0027ll do my time without complaining when I\u0027ve done something wrong, Dad, but I\u0027m not going to put up with your prejudices.\"\n He sputtered, but managed nothing coherent.\n \"Now, I know that you know that I have every right to see Mom for the weekend. You can\u0027t honestly tell me you\u0027d object to the plan if I was going with Alice or Angela.\"\n \"Girls,\" he grunted, with a nod.\n \"Would it bother you if I took Jacob?\"\n I\u0027d only picked the name because I knew of my father\u0027s preference for Jacob, but I quickly wished I hadn\u0027t; Edward\u0027s teeth clenched together with an audible snap.\n My father struggled to compose himself before he answered. \"Yes,\" he said in an unconvincing voice.\n \"That would bother me.\"\n \"You\u0027re a rotten liar, Dad.\"\n \"Bella -\"\n \"It\u0027s not like I\u0027m headed off to Vegas to be a showgirl or anything. I\u0027m going to see Mom,\" I reminded him. \"She\u0027s just as much my parental authority as you are.\"\n He threw me a withering look.\n \"Are you implying something about Mom\u0027s ability to look after me?\"\n Charlie flinched at the threat implicit in my question.\n \"You\u0027d better hope I don\u0027t mention this to her,\" I said.\n \"You\u0027d better not,\" he warned. \"I\u0027m not happy about this, Bella.\"\n \"There\u0027s no reason for you to be upset.\"\n He rolled his eyes, but I could tell the storm was over.\n I turned to pull the plug out of the sink. \"So my homework is done, your dinner is done, the dishes are done, and I\u0027m not grounded. I\u0027m going out. I\u0027ll be back before ten-thirty.\"\n \"Where are you going?\" His face, almost back to normal, flushed light red again.\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I admitted. \"I\u0027ll keep it within a ten-mile radius, though. Okay?\"\n He grunted something that did not sound like approval, and stalked out of the room. Naturally, as soon as I\u0027d won the fight, I began to feel guilty.\n \"We\u0027re going out?\" Edward asked, his voice low but enthusiastic.\n I turned to glower at him. \"Yes. I think I\u0027d like to speak to you alone.\"\n He didn\u0027t look as apprehensive as I thought he should.\n I waited to begin until we were safely in his car.\n \"What was that?\" I demanded.\n \"I know you want to see your mother, Bella - you\u0027ve been talking about her in your sleep. Worrying actually.\"\n \"I have?\"\n He nodded. \"But, clearly, you were too much of a coward to deal with Charlie, so I interceded on your behalf.\"\n \"Interceded? You threw me to the sharks!\"\n He rolled his eyes. \"I don\u0027t think you were in any danger.\"\n \"I told you I didn\u0027t want to fight with Charlie.\"\n \"Nobody said that you had to.\"\n I glowered at him. \"I can\u0027t help myself when he gets all bossy like that - my natural teenage instincts overpower me.\"\n He chuckled. \"Well, that\u0027s not my fault.\"\n I stared at him, speculating. He didn\u0027t seem to notice. His face was serene as he gazed out the windshield. Something was off, but I couldn\u0027t put my finger on it. Or maybe it was just my imagination again, running wild like it had this afternoon.\n \"Does this sudden urge to see Florida have anything to do with the party at Billy\u0027s place?\"\n His jaw flexed. \"Nothing at all. It wouldn\u0027t matter if you were here or on the other side of the world, you still wouldn\u0027t be going.\"\n It was just like with Charlie before - just like being treated as a misbehaving child. I gritted my teeth together so I wouldn\u0027t start shouting. I didn\u0027t want to fight with Edward, too.\n Edward sighed, and when he spoke his voice was warm and velvet again. \"So what do you want to do tonight?\" he asked.\n \"Can we go to your house? I haven\u0027t seen Esme in so long.\"\n He smiled. \"She\u0027ll like that. Especially when she hears what we\u0027re doing this weekend.\"\n I groaned in defeat.\n We didn\u0027t stay out late, as I\u0027d promised. I was not surprised to see the lights still on when we pulled up in front of the house - I knew Charlie would be waiting to yell at me some more.\n \"You\u0027d better not come inside,\" I said. \"It will only make things worse.\"\n \"His thoughts are relatively calm,\" Edward teased. His expression made me wonder if there was some additional joke I was missing. The corners of his mouth twitched, fighting a smile.\n \"I\u0027ll see you later,\" I muttered glumly.\n He laughed and kissed the top of my head. \"I\u0027ll be back when Charlie\u0027s snoring.\"\n The TV was loud when I got inside. I briefly considered trying to sneak past him.\n \"Could you come in here, Bella?\" Charlie called, sinking that plan.\n My feet dragged as I took the five necessary steps.\n \"What\u0027s up, Dad?\"\n \"Did you have a nice time tonight?\" he asked. He seemed ill at ease. I looked for hidden meanings in his words before I answered.\n \"Yes,\" I said hesitantly.\n \"What did you do?\"\n I shrugged. \"Hung out with Alice and Jasper. Edward beat Alice at chess, and then I played Jasper. He buried me.\"\n I smiled. Edward and Alice playing chess was one of the funniest things I\u0027d ever seen. They\u0027d sat there nearly motionless, staring at the board, while Alice foresaw the moves he would make and he picked the moves she would make in return out of her head. They played most of the game in their minds; I think they\u0027d each moved two pawns when Alice suddenly flicked her king over and surrendered. It took all of three minutes.\n Charlie hit the mute button - an unusual action.\n \"Look, there\u0027s something I need to say.\" He frowned, looking very uncomfortable.\n I sat still, waiting. He met my gaze for a second before shifting his eyes to the floor. He didn\u0027t say anything more.\n \"What is it, Dad?\"\n He sighed. \"I\u0027m not good at this kind of thing. I don\u0027t know how to start. . . .\"\n I waited again.\n \"Okay, Bella. Here\u0027s the thing.\" He got up from the couch and started pacing back and forth across the room, looking as his feet all the time. \"You and Edward seem pretty serious, and there are some things that you need to be careful about. I know you\u0027re an adult now, but you\u0027re still young, Bella, and there are a lot of important things you need to know when you . . . well, when you\u0027re physically involved with -\"\n \"Oh, please, please no!\" I begged, jumping to my feet. \"Please tell me you are not trying to have a sex talk with me, Charlie.\"\n He glared at the floor. \"I am your father. I have responsibilities. Remember, I\u0027m just as embarrassed as you are.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s humanly possible. Anyway, Mom beat you to the punch about ten years ago. You\u0027re off the hook.\"\n \"Ten years ago you didn\u0027t have a boyfriend,\" he muttered unwillingly. I could tell he was battling with his desire to drop the subject. We were both standing up, looking at the floor, and facing away from each other.\n \"I don\u0027t think the essentials have changed that much,\" I mumbled, and my face had to be as red as his.\n This was beyond the seventh circle of Hades; even worse was realizing that Edward had known this was coming. No wonder he\u0027d seemed so smug in the car.\n \"Just tell me that you two are being responsible,\" Charlie pled, obviously wishing a pit would open in the floor so that he could fall in.\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it, Dad, it\u0027s not like that.\"\n \"Not that I don\u0027t trust you, Bella, but I know you don\u0027t want to tell me anything about this, and you know I don\u0027t really want to hear it. I will try to be open-minded, though. I know the times have changed.\"\n I laughed awkwardly. \"Maybe the times have, but Edward is very old-fashioned. You have nothing to worry about.\"\n Charlie sighed. \"Sure he is,\" he muttered.\n \"Ugh!\" I groaned. \"I really wish you were not forcing me to say this out loud, Dad. Really. But . . . I am a . . . virgin, and I have no immediate plans to change that status.\"\n We both cringed, but then Charlie\u0027s face smoothed out. He seemed to believe me.\n \"Can I go to bed, now? Please.\"\n \"In a minute,\" he said.\n \"Aw, please, Dad? I\u0027m begging you.\"\n \"The embarrassing part\u0027s over, I promise,\" he assured me.\n I shot a glance at him, and was grateful to see that he looked more relaxed, that his face was back to its regular color. He sank down onto the sofa, sighing with relief that he was past the sex speech.\n \"What now?\"\n \"I just wanted to know how the balance thing is coming along.\"\n \"Oh. Good, I guess. I made plans with Angela today. I\u0027m going to help her with her graduation announcements. Just us girls.\"\n \"That\u0027s nice. And what about Jake?\"\n I sighed. \"I haven\u0027t figured that one out yet, Dad.\"\n \"Keep trying, Bella. I know you\u0027ll do the right thing. You\u0027re a good person.\"\n Nice. So if I didn\u0027t figure out some way to make things right with Jacob, then I was a bad person? That was below the belt.\n \"Sure, sure,\" I agreed. The automatic response almost made me smile - it was something I\u0027d picked up from Jacob. I even said it in the same patronizing tone he used with his own father.\n Charlie grinned and turned the sound back on. He slumped lower into the cushions, pleased with his night\u0027s work. I could tell he would be up with the game for a while.\n \"\u0027Night, Bells.\"\n \"See you in the morning!\" I sprinted for the stairs.\n Edward was long gone and he wouldn\u0027t be back until Charlie was asleep - he was probably out hunting or something to pass the time - so I was in no hurry to undress for bed. I wasn\u0027t in the mood to be alone, but I certainly wasn\u0027t going to go back downstairs to hang out with my Dad, just in case he thought of some topic of sex education that he hadn\u0027t touched on before; I shuddered.\n So, thanks to Charlie, I was wound up and anxious. My homework was done and I didn\u0027t feel mellow enough for reading or just listening to music. I considered calling Ren��e with the news of my visit, but then I realized that it was three hours later in Florida, and she would be asleep.\n I could call Angela, I supposed.\n But suddenly I knew that it wasn\u0027t Angela that I wanted to talk to. That I needed to talk to.\n I stared at the blank black window, biting my lip. I don\u0027t know how long I stood there weighing the pros against the cons - doing the right thing by Jacob, seeing my closest friend again, being a good person, versus making Edward furious with me. Ten minutes maybe. Long enough to decide that the pros were valid while the cons were not. Edward was only concerned about my safety, and I knew that there was really no problem on that count.\n The phone wasn\u0027t any help; Jacob had refused to answer my phone calls since Edward\u0027s return. Besides, I needed to see him - see him smiling again the way he used to. I needed to replace that awful last memory of his face warped and twisted by pain if I was ever going to have any peace of mind.\n I had an hour probably. I could make a quick run down to La Push and be back before Edward realized I had gone. It was past my curfew, but would Charlie really care about that when Edward wasn\u0027t involved? One way to find out.\n I grabbed my jacket and shoved my arms through the sleeves as I ran down the stairs.\n Charlie looked up from the game, instantly suspicious.\n \"You care if I go see Jake tonight?\" I asked breathlessly. \"I won\u0027t stay long.\"\n As soon as I said Jake\u0027s name, Charlie\u0027s expression relaxed into a smug smile. He didn\u0027t seem surprised at all that his lecture had taken effect so quickly. \"Sure, kid. No problem. Stay as long as you like.\"\n \"Thanks, Dad,\" I said as I darted out the door.\n Like any fugitive, I couldn\u0027t help looking over my shoulder a few times while I jogged to my truck, but the night was so black that there really was no point. I had to feel my way along the side of the truck to the handle.\n My eyes were just beginning to adjust as I shoved my keys in the ignition. I twisted them hard to the left, but instead of roaring deafeningly to life, the engine just clicked. I tried it again with the same results.\n And then a small motion in my peripheral vision made me jump.\n \"Gah!\" I gasped in shock when I saw that I was not alone in the cab.\n Edward sat very still, a faint bright spot in the darkness, only his hands moving as he turned a mysterious black object around and around. He stared at the object as he spoke.\n \"Alice called,\" he murmured.\n Alice! Damn. I\u0027d forgotten to account for her in my plans. He must have her watching me.\n \"She got nervous when your future rather abruptly disappeared five minutes ago.\"\n My eyes, already wide with surprise, popped wider.\n \"Because she can\u0027t see the wolves, you know,\" he explained in the same low murmur. \"Had you forgotten that? When you decide to mingle your fate with theirs, you disappear, too. You couldn\u0027t know that part, I realize that. But can you understand why that might make me a little . . . anxious? Alice saw you disappear, and she couldn\u0027t even tell if you\u0027d come home or not. Your future got lost, just like theirs.\n \"We\u0027re not sure why this is. Some natural defense they\u0027re born with?\" He spoke as if he were talking to himself now, still looking at the piece of my truck\u0027s engine as he twirled it in his hands. \"That doesn\u0027t seem entirely likely, since I haven\u0027t had any trouble reading their thoughts. The Blacks\u0027 at least. Carlisle theorizes that it\u0027s because their lives are so ruled by their transformations. It\u0027s more an involuntary reaction than a decision. Utterly unpredictable, and it changes everything about them. In that instant when they shift from one form to the other, they don\u0027t really even exist. The future can\u0027t hold them. . . .\"\n I listened to his musing in stony silence.\n \"I\u0027ll put your car back together in time for school, in case you\u0027d like to drive yourself,\" he assured me after a minute.\n With my lips mashed together, I retrieved my keys and stiffly climbed out of the truck.\n \"Shut your window if you want me to stay away tonight. I\u0027ll understand,\" he whispered just before I slammed the door.\n I stomped into the house, slamming that door, too.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Charlie demanded from the couch.\n \"Truck won\u0027t start,\" I growled.\n \"Want me to look at it?\"\n \"No. I\u0027ll try it in the morning.\"\n \"Want to use my car?\"\n I wasn\u0027t supposed to drive his police cruiser. Charlie must be really desperate to get me to La Push. Nearly as desperate as I was.\n \"No. I\u0027m tired,\" I grumbled. \"\u0027Night.\"\n I stamped my way up the stairs, and went straight to my window. I shoved the metal frame roughly - it crashed shut and the glass trembled.\n I stared at the shivering black glass for a long moment, until it was still. Then I sighed, and opened the window as wide as it would go. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-3.html","bookId":2025,"book":{"id":2025,"title":"The Twilight Saga 3: Eclipse (Twilight #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Readers captivated by Twilight and New Moon will eagerly devour the paperback edition Eclipse, the third book in Stephenie Meyer\u0027s riveting vampire love saga.
