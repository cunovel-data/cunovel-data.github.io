My husband and sons have been incredibly long-suffering-anyone else would have had me committed to an asylum long ago. Thanks for keeping me around, guys. My Elizabeth-Elizabeth Eulberg, publicist extraordinaire-has made all the difference to my sanity both on and off the road. Few people are lucky enough to work so closely with their BFF, and I am eternally grateful for the wholesomeness of cheese-loving Midwestern girls. Jodi Reamer continues to guide my career with genius and finesse. It is very comforting to know that I am in such good hands. It is also wonderful to have my manuscripts in the right hands. Thanks to Rebecca Davis for being so in tune with the story in my head and helping me find the best ways to express it. Thanks to Megan Tingley, first for your unwavering faith in my work, and second for polishing that work until it shines. Everyone at Little, Brown and Company Books for Young Readers has taken such amazing care of my creations. I can tell it is a true labor of love for you all, and I appreciate it more than you know. Thank you Chris Murphy, Shawn Foster, Andrew Smith, Stephanie Voros, Gail Doobinin, Tina McIntyre, Ames O\u0027Neill, and the many others who have made the Twilight series a success. I can\u0027t believe how lucky I was to discover Lori Joffs, who somehow manages to be both the fastest and the most meticulous reader at the same time. I am thrilled to have a friend and accomplice who is so insightful, talented, and patient with my whining. Lori Joffs again, along with Laura Cristiano, Michaela Child, and Ted Joffs, for creating and maintaining the brightest star in the Twilight online universe, the Twilight Lexicon. I truly appreciate all the hard work you put into providing a happy place for my fans to hang out. Thanks also to my international friends at Crepusculo- es.com for a site so amazing it transcends the language barrier. Kudos as well to Brittany Gardener\u0027s fabulous work on the Twilight and New Moon by Stephenie Meyer MySpace Group, a fan site so large that the idea of keeping track of it boggles my mind; Brittany, you amaze me. Katie and Audrey, Bella Penombra is a thing of beauty. Heather, the Nexus rocks. I can\u0027t mention all the amazing sites and their creators here, but thank you very much to each of you. Many thanks to my cold readers, Laura Cristiano, Michelle Vieira, Bridget Creviston, and Kimberlee Peterson, for their invaluable input and encouraging enthusiasm. Every writer needs an independent bookstore for a friend; I\u0027m so grateful for my hometown supporters at Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe, Arizona, and especially to Faith Hochhalter, who has brilliant taste in literature. I am in your debt, rock gods of Muse, for yet another inspiring album. Thank you for continuing to create my favorite writing music. I am also grateful to all the other bands on my playlist who help me through the writer\u0027s block, and to my new discoveries, Ok Go, Gomez, Placebo, Blue October, and Jack\u0027s Mannequin. Most of all, a gargantuan thank-you to all of my fans. I firmly believe that my fans are the most attractive, intelligent, exciting, and dedicated fans in the whole world. I wish I could give you each a big hug and a Porsche 911 Turbo. All rights reserved.
