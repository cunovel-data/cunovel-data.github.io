{"id":107907,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\"THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAND,\" Jasper answered in a quiet voice. \"Repeated a thousand times.\" He laughed a little ruefully and brushed at his arm. \"Our venom is the only thing that leaves a scar.\"\n \"Why?\" I breathed in horror, feeling rude but unable to stop staring at his subtly ravaged skin.\n \"I didn\u0027t have quite the same . . . upbringing as my adopted siblings here. My beginning was something else entirely.\" His voice turned hard as he finished.\n I gaped at him, appalled.\n \"Before I tell you my story,\" Jasper said, \"you must understand that there are places in our world, Bella, where the life span of the never-aging is measured in weeks, and not centuries.\"\n The others had heard this before. Carlisle and Emmett turned their attention to the TV again. Alice moved silently to sit at Esme\u0027s feet. But Edward was just as absorbed as I was; I could feel his eyes on my face, reading every flicker of emotion.\n \"To really understand why, you have to look at the world from a different perspective. You have to imagine the way it looks to the powerful, the greedy . . . the perpetually thirsty.\n \"You see, there are places in this world that are more desirable to us than others. Places where we can be less restrained, and still avoid detection.\n \"Picture, for instance, a map of the western hemisphere. Picture on it every human life as a small red dot. The thicker the red, the more easily we - well, those who exist this way - can feed without attracting notice.\"\n I shuddered at the image in my head, at the word feed. But Jasper wasn\u0027t worried about frightening me, not overprotective like Edward always was. He went on without a pause.\n \"Not that the covens in the South care much for what the humans notice or do not. It\u0027s the Volturi that keep them in check. They are the only ones the southern covens fear. If not for the Volturi, the rest of us would be quickly exposed.\"\n I frowned at the way he pronounced the name - with respect, almost gratitude. The idea of the Volturi as the good guys in any sense was hard to accept.\n \"The North is, by comparison, very civilized. Mostly we are nomads here who enjoy the day as well as the night, who allow humans to interact with us unsuspectingly - anonymity is important to us all.\n \"It\u0027s a different world in the South. The immortals there come out only at night. They spend the day plotting their next move, or anticipating their enemy\u0027s. Because it has been war in the South, constant war for centuries, with never one moment of truce. The covens there barely note the existence of humans, except as soldiers notice a herd of cows by the wayside - food for the taking. They only hide from the notice of the herd because of the Volturi.\"\n \"But what are they fighting for?\" I asked.\n Jasper smiled. \"Remember the map with the red dots?\"\n He waited, so I nodded.\n \"They fight for control of the thickest red.\n \"You see, it occurred to someone once that, if he were the only vampire in, let\u0027s say Mexico City, well then, he could feed every night, twice, three times, and no one would ever notice. He plotted ways to get rid of the competition.\n \"Others had the same idea. Some came up with more effective tactics than others.\n \"But the most effective tactic was invented by a fairly young vampire named Benito. The first anyone ever heard of him, he came down from somewhere north of Dallas and massacred the two small covens that shared the area near Houston. Two nights later, he took on the much stronger clan of allies that claimed Monterrey in northern Mexico. Again, he won.\"\n \"How did he win?\" I asked with wary curiosity.\n \"Benito had created an army of newborn vampires. He was the first one to think of it, and, in the beginning, he was unstoppable. Very young vampires are volatile, wild, and almost impossible to control. One newborn can be reasoned with, taught to restrain himself, but ten, fifteen together are a nightmare. They\u0027ll turn on each other as easily as on the enemy you point them at. Benito had to keep making more as they fought amongst themselves, and as the covens he decimated took more than half his force down before they lost.\n \"You see, though newborns are dangerous, they are still possible to defeat if you know what you\u0027re doing. They\u0027re incredibly powerful physically, for the first year or so, and if they\u0027re allowed to bring strength to bear they can crush an older vampire with ease. But they are slaves to their instincts, and thus predictable. Usually, they have no skill in fighting, only muscle and ferocity. And in this case, overwhelming numbers.\"\n \"The vampires in southern Mexico realized what was coming for them, and they did the only thing they could think of to counteract Benito. They made armies of their own. . . .\n \"All hell broke loose - and I mean that more literally than you can possibly imagine. We immortals have our histories, too, and this particular war will never be forgotten. Of course, it was not a good time to be human in Mexico, either.\"\n I shuddered.\n \"When the body count reached epidemic proportions - in fact, your histories blame a disease for the population slump - the Volturi finally stepped in. The entire guard came together and sought out every newborn in the bottom half of North America. Benito was entrenched in Puebla, building his army as quickly as he could in order to take on the prize - Mexico City. The Volturi started with him, and then moved on to the rest.\n \"Anyone who was found with the newborns was executed immediately, and, since everyone was trying to protect themselves from Benito, Mexico was emptied of vampires for a time.\n \"The Volturi were cleaning house for almost a year. This was another chapter of our history that will always be remembered, though there were very few witnesses left to speak of what it was like. I spoke to someone once who had, from a distance, watched what happened when they visited Culiac��n.\"\n Jasper shuddered. I realized that I had never before seen him either afraid or horrified. This was a first.\n \"It was enough that the fever for conquest did not spread from the South. The rest of the world stayed sane. We owe the Volturi for our present way of life.\n \"But when the Volturi went back to Italy, the survivors were quick to stake their claims in the South.\n \"It didn\u0027t take long before covens began to dispute again. There was a lot of bad blood, if you\u0027ll forgive the expression. Vendettas abounded. The idea of newborns was already there, and some were not able to resist. However, the Volturi had not been forgotten, and the southern covens were more careful this time. The newborns were selected from the human pool with more care, and given more training. They were used circumspectly, and the humans remained, for the most part, oblivious. Their creators gave the Volturi no reason to return.\n \"The wars resumed, but on a smaller scale. Every now and then, someone would go too far, speculation would begin in the human newspapers, and the Volturi would return and clean out the city. But they let the others, the careful ones, continue. . . .\"\n Jasper was staring off into space.\n \"That\u0027s how you were changed.\" My realization was a whisper.\n \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"When I was human, I lived in Houston, Texas. I was almost seventeen years old when I joined the Confederate Army in 1861. I lied to the recruiters and told them I was twenty. I was tall enough to get away with it.\n \"My military career was short-lived, but very promising. People always . . . liked me, listened to what I had to say. My father said it was charisma. Of course, now I know it was probably something more. But, whatever the reason, I was promoted quickly through the ranks, over older, more experienced men. The Confederate Army was new and scrambling to organize itself, so that provided opportunities, as well. By the first battle of Galveston - well, it was more of a skirmish, really - I was the youngest major in Texas, not even acknowledging my real age.\n \"I was placed in charge of evacuating the women and children from the city when the Union\u0027s mortar boats reached the harbor. It took a day to prepare them, and then I left with the first column of civilians to convey them to Houston.\n \"I remember that one night very clearly.\n \"We reached the city after dark. I stayed only long enough to make sure the entire party was safely situated. As soon as that was done, I got myself a fresh horse, and I headed back to Galveston. There wasn\u0027t time to rest.\n \"Just a mile outside the city, I found three women on foot. I assumed they were stragglers and dismounted at once to offer them my aid. But, when I could see their faces in the dim light of the moon, I was stunned into silence. They were, without question, the three most beautiful women I had ever seen.\n \"They had such pale skin, I remember marveling at it. Even the little black-haired girl, whose features were clearly Mexican, was porcelain in the moonlight. They seemed young, all of them, still young enough to be called girls. I knew they were not lost members of our party. I would have remembered seeing these three.\n \"\u0027He\u0027s speechless,\u0027 the tallest girl said in a lovely, delicate voice - it was like wind chimes. She had fair hair, and her skin was snow white.\n \"The other was blonder still, her skin just as chalky. Her face was like an angel\u0027s. She leaned toward me with half-closed eyes and inhaled deeply.\n \"\u0027Mmm,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027Lovely.\u0027\n \"The small one, the tiny brunette, put her hand on the girl\u0027s arm and spoke quickly. Her voice was too soft and musical to be sharp, but that seemed to be the way she intended it.\n \"\u0027Concentrate, Nettie,\u0027 she said.\n \"I\u0027d always had a good sense of how people related to each other, and it was immediately clear that the brunette was somehow in charge of the others. If they\u0027d been military, I would have said that she outranked them.\n \"\u0027He looks right - young, strong, an officer. . . . \u0027 The brunette paused, and I tried unsuccessfully to speak. \u0027And there\u0027s something more . . . do you sense it?\u0027 she asked the other two. \u0027He\u0027s . . . compelling.\u0027\n \"\u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 Nettie quickly agreed, leaning toward me again.\n \"\u0027Patience,\u0027 the brunette cautioned her. \u0027I want to keep this one.\u0027\n \"Nettie frowned; she seemed annoyed.\n \"\u0027You\u0027d better do it, Maria,\u0027 the taller blonde spoke again. \u0027If he\u0027s important to you. I kill them twice as often as I keep them.\u0027\n \"\u0027Yes, I\u0027ll do it,\u0027 Maria agreed. \u0027I really do like this one. Take Nettie away, will you? I don\u0027t want to have to protect my back while I\u0027m trying to focus.\u0027\n \"My hair was standing up on the back of my neck, though I didn\u0027t understand the meaning of anything the beautiful creatures were saying. My instincts told me that there was danger, that the angel had meant it when she spoke of killing, but my judgment overruled my instincts. I had not been taught to fear women, but to protect them.\n \"\u0027Let\u0027s hunt,\u0027 Nettie agreed enthusiastically, reaching for the tall girl\u0027s hand. They wheeled - they were so graceful! - and sprinted toward the city. They seemed to almost take flight, they were so fast - their white dresses blew out behind them like wings. I blinked in amazement, and they were gone.\n \"I turned to stare at Maria, who was watching me curiously.\n \"I\u0027d never been superstitious in my life. Until that second, I\u0027d never believed in ghosts or any other such nonsense. Suddenly, I was unsure.\n \"\u0027What is your name, soldier?\u0027 Maria asked me.\n \"\u0027Major Jasper Whitlock, ma\u0027am,\u0027 I stammered, unable to be impolite to a female, even if she was a ghost.\n \"\u0027I truly hope you survive, Jasper,\u0027 she said in her gentle voice. \u0027I have a good feeling about you.\u0027\n \"She took a step closer, and inclined her head as if she were going to kiss me. I stood frozen in place, though my instincts were screaming at me to run.\"\n Jasper paused, his face thoughtful. \"A few days later,\" he finally said, and I wasn\u0027t sure if he had edited his story for my sake or because he was responding to the tension that even I could feel exuding from Edward, \"I was introduced to my new life.\n \"Their names were Maria, Nettie, and Lucy. They hadn\u0027t been together long - Maria had rounded up the other two - all three were survivors of recently lost battles. Theirs was a partnership of convenience. Maria wanted revenge, and she wanted her territories back. The others were eager to increase their . . . herd lands, I suppose you could say. They were putting together an army, and going about it more carefully than was usual. It was Maria\u0027s idea. She wanted a superior army, so she sought out specific humans who had potential. Then she gave us much more attention, more training than anyone else had bothered with. She taught us to fight, and she taught us to be invisible to the humans. When we did well, we were rewarded. . . .\"\n He paused, editing again.\n \"She was in a hurry, though. Maria knew that the massive strength of the newborn began to wane around the year mark, and she wanted to act while we were strong.\n \"There were six of us when I joined Maria\u0027s band. She added four more within a fortnight. We were all male - Maria wanted soldiers - and that made it slightly more difficult to keep from fighting amongst ourselves. I fought my first battles against my new comrades in arms. I was quicker than the others, better at combat. Maria was pleased with me, though put out that she had to keep replacing the ones I destroyed. I was rewarded often, and that made me stronger.\n \"Maria was a good judge of character. She decided to put me in charge of the others - as if I were being promoted. It suited my nature exactly. The casualties went down dramatically, and our numbers swelled to hover around twenty.\n \"This was considerable for the cautious times we lived in. My ability, as yet undefined, to control the emotional atmosphere around me was vitally effective. We soon began to work together in a way that newborn vampires had never cooperated before. Even Maria, Nettie, and Lucy were able to work together more easily.\n \"Maria grew quite fond of me - she began to depend upon me. And, in some ways, I worshipped the ground she walked on. I had no idea that any other life was possible. Maria told us this was the way things were, and we believed.\n \"She asked me to tell her when my brothers and I were ready to fight, and I was eager to prove myself. I pulled together an army of twenty-three in the end - twenty-three unbelievably strong new vampires, organized and skilled as no others before. Maria was ecstatic.\n \"We crept down toward Monterrey, her former home, and she unleashed us on her enemies. They had only nine newborns at the time, and a pair of older vampires controlling them. We took them down more easily than Maria could believe, losing only four in the process. It was an unheard-of margin of victory.\n \"And we were well trained. We did it without attracting notice. The city changed hands without any human being aware.\n \"Success made Maria greedy. It wasn\u0027t long before she began to eye other cities. That first year, she extended her control to cover most of Texas and northern Mexico. Then the others came from the South to dislodge her.\"\n He brushed two fingers along the faint pattern of scars on his arm.\n \"The fighting was intense. Many began to worry that the Volturi would return. Of the original twenty-three, I was the only one to survive the first eighteen months. We both won and lost. Nettie and Lucy turned on Maria eventually - but that one we won.\n \"Maria and I were able to hold on to Monterrey. It quieted a little, though the wars continued. The idea of conquest was dying out; it was mostly vengeance and feuding now. So many had lost their partners, and that is something our kind does not forgive. . . .\n \"Maria and I always kept a dozen or so newborns ready. They meant little to us - they were pawns, they were disposable. When they outgrew their usefulness, we did dispose of them. My life continued in the same violent pattern and the years passed. I was sick of it all for a very long time before anything changed . . .\n \"Decades later, I developed a friendship with a newborn who\u0027d remained useful and survived his first three years, against the odds. His name was Peter. I liked Peter; he was . . . civilized - I suppose that\u0027s the right word. He didn\u0027t enjoy the fight, though he was good at it.\n \"He was assigned to deal with the newborns - babysit them, you could say. It was a full-time job.\n \"And then it was time to purge again. The newborns were outgrowing their strength; they were due to be replaced. Peter was supposed to help me dispose of them. We took them aside individually, you see, one by one . . . It was always a very long night. This time, he tried to convince me that a few had potential, but Maria had instructed that we get rid of them all. I told him no.\n \"We were about halfway through, and I could feel that it was taking a great toll on Peter. I was trying to decide whether or not I should send him away and finish up myself as I called out the next victim. To my surprise, he was suddenly angry, furious. I braced for whatever his mood might foreshadow - he was a good fighter, but he was never a match for me.\n \"The newborn I\u0027d summoned was a female, just past her year mark. Her name was Charlotte. His feelings changed when she came into view; they gave him away. He yelled for her to run, and he bolted after her. I could have pursued them, but I didn\u0027t. I felt . . . averse to destroying him.\n \"Maria was irritated with me for that . . .\n \"Five years later, Peter snuck back for me. He picked a good day to arrive.\n \"Maria was mystified by my ever-deteriorating frame of mind. She\u0027d never felt a moment\u0027s depression, and I wondered why I was different. I began to notice a change in her emotions when she was near me - sometimes there was fear . . . and malice - the same feelings that had given me advance warning when Nettie and Lucy struck. I was preparing myself to destroy my only ally, the core of my existence, when Peter returned.\n \"Peter told me about his new life with Charlotte, told me about options I\u0027d never dreamed I had. In five years, they\u0027d never had a fight, though they\u0027d met many others in the north. Others who could co-exist without the constant mayhem.\n \"In one conversation, he had me convinced. I was ready to go, and somewhat relieved I wouldn\u0027t have to kill Maria. I\u0027d been her companion for as many years as Carlisle and Edward have been together, yet the bond between us was nowhere near as strong. When you live for the fight, for the blood, the relationships you form are tenuous and easily broken. I walked away without a backward glance.\n \"I traveled with Peter and Charlotte for a few years, getting the feel of this new, more peaceful world. But the depression didn\u0027t fade. I didn\u0027t understand what was wrong with me, until Peter noticed that it was always worse after I\u0027d hunted.\n \"I contemplated that. In so many years of slaughter and carnage, I\u0027d lost nearly all of my humanity. I was undeniably a nightmare, a monster of the grisliest kind. Yet each time I found another human victim, I would feel a faint prick of remembrance for that other life. Watching their eyes widen in wonder at my beauty, I could see Maria and the others in my head, what they had looked like to me the last night that I was Jasper Whitlock. It was stronger for me - this borrowed memory - than it was for anyone else, because I could feel everything my prey was feeling. And I lived their emotions as I killed them.\n \"You\u0027ve experienced the way I can manipulate the emotions around myself, Bella, but I wonder if you realize how the feelings in a room affect me. I live every day in a climate of emotion. For the first century of my life, I lived in a world of bloodthirsty vengeance. Hate was my constant companion. It eased some when I left Maria, but I still had to feel the horror and fear of my prey.\n \"It began to be too much.\n \"The depression got worse, and I wandered away from Peter and Charlotte. Civilized as they were, they didn\u0027t feel the same aversion I was beginning to feel. They only wanted peace from the fight. I was so wearied by killing - killing anyone, even mere humans.\n \"Yet I had to keep killing. What choice did I have? I tried to kill less often, but I would get too thirsty and I would give in. After a century of instant gratification, I found self-discipline . . . challenging. I still haven\u0027t perfected that.\"\n Jasper was lost in the story, as was I. It surprised me when his desolate expression smoothed into a peaceful smile.\n \"I was in Philadelphia. There was a storm, and I was out during the day - something I was not completely comfortable with yet. I knew standing in the rain would attract attention, so I ducked into a little half-empty diner. My eyes were dark enough that no one would notice them, though this meant I was thirsty, and that worried me a little.\n \"She was there - expecting me, naturally.\" He chuckled once. \"She hopped down from the high stool at the counter as soon as I walked in and came directly toward me.\n \"It shocked me. I was not sure if she meant to attack. That\u0027s the only interpretation of her behavior my past had to offer. But she was smiling. And the emotions that were emanating from her were like nothing I\u0027d ever felt before.\n \"\u0027You\u0027ve kept me waiting a long time,\u0027 she said.\"\n I didn\u0027t realize Alice had come to stand behind me again.\n \"And you ducked your head, like a good Southern gentleman, and said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry, ma\u0027am.\u0027\" Alice laughed at the memory.\n Jasper smiled down at her. \"You held out your hand, and I took it without stopping to make sense of what I was doing. For the first time in almost a century, I felt hope.\"\n Jasper took Alice\u0027s hand as he spoke.\n Alice grinned. \"I was just relieved. I thought you were never going to show up.\"\n They smiled at each other for a long moment, and then Jasper looked back to me, the soft expression lingering.\n \"Alice told me what she\u0027d seen of Carlisle and his family. I could hardly believe that such an existence was possible. But Alice made me optimistic. So we went to find them.\"\n \"Scared the hell out of them, too,\" Edward said, rolling his eyes at Jasper before turning to me to explain.\n \"Emmett and I were away hunting. Jasper shows up, covered in battle scars, towing this little freak\" - he nudged Alice playfully - \"who greets them all by name, knows everything about them, and wants to know which room she can move into.\"\n Alice and Jasper laughed in harmony, soprano and bass.\n \"When I got home, all my things were in the garage,\" Edward continued.\n Alice shrugged. \"Your room had the best view.\"\n They all laughed together now.\n \"That\u0027s a nice story,\" I said.\n Three pairs of eyes questioned my sanity.\n \"I mean the last part,\" I defended myself. \"The happy ending with Alice.\"\n \"Alice has made all the difference,\" Jasper agreed. \"This is a climate I enjoy.\"\n But the momentary pause in the stress couldn\u0027t last.\n \"An army,\" Alice whispered. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\"\n The others were intent again, their eyes locked on Jasper\u0027s face.\n \"I thought I must be interpreting the signs incorrectly. Because where is the motive? Why would someone create an army in Seattle? There is no history there, no vendetta. It makes no sense from a conquest standpoint, either; no one claims it. Nomads pass through, but there\u0027s no one to fight for it. No one to defend it from.\n \"But I\u0027ve seen this before, and there\u0027s no other explanation. There is an army of newborn vampires in Seattle. Fewer than twenty, I\u0027d guess. The difficult part is that they are totally untrained. Whoever made them just set them loose. It will only get worse, and it won\u0027t be much longer till the Volturi step in. Actually, I\u0027m surprised they\u0027ve let this go on so long.\"\n \"What can we do?\" Carlisle asked.\n \"If we want to avoid the Volturi\u0027s involvement, we will have to destroy the newborns, and we will have to do it very soon.\" Jasper\u0027s face was hard. Knowing his story now, I could guess how this evaluation must disturb him. \"I can teach you how. It won\u0027t be easy in the city. The young ones aren\u0027t concerned about secrecy, but we will have to be. It will limit us in ways that they are not. Maybe we can lure them out.\"\n \"Maybe we won\u0027t have to.\" Edward\u0027s voice was bleak. \"Does it occur to anyone else that the only possible threat in the area that would call for the creation of an army is . . . us?\"\n Jasper\u0027s eyes narrowed; Carlisle\u0027s widened, shocked.\n \"Tanya\u0027s family is also near,\" Esme said slowly, unwilling to accept Edward\u0027s words.\n \"The newborns aren\u0027t ravaging Anchorage, Esme. I think we have to consider the idea that we are the targets.\"\n \"They\u0027re not coming after us,\" Alice insisted, and then paused. \"Or . . . they don\u0027t know that they are. Not yet.\"\n \"What is that?\" Edward asked, curious and tense. \"What are you remembering?\"\n \"Flickers,\" Alice said. \"I can\u0027t see a clear picture when I try to see what\u0027s going on, nothing concrete. But I\u0027ve been getting these strange flashes. Not enough to make sense of. It\u0027s as if someone\u0027s changing their mind, moving from one course of action to another so quickly that I can\u0027t get a good view. . . .\"\n \"Indecision?\" Jasper asked in disbelief.\n \"I don\u0027t know. . . .\"\n \"Not indecision,\" Edward growled. \"Knowledge. Someone who knows you can\u0027t see anything until the\n decision is made. Someone who is hiding from us. Playing with the holes in your vision.\"\n \"Who would know that?\" Alice whispered.\n Edward\u0027s eyes were hard as ice. \"Aro knows you as well as you know yourself.\"\n \"But I would see if they\u0027d decided to come. . . .\"\n \"Unless they didn\u0027t want to get their hands dirty.\"\n \"A favor,\" Rosalie suggested, speaking for the first time. \"Someone in the South . . . someone who already had trouble with the rules. Someone who should have been destroyed is offered a second chance - if they take care of this one small problem. . . . That would explain the Volturi\u0027s sluggish response.\"\n \"Why?\" Carlisle asked, still shocked. \"There\u0027s no reason for the Volturi -\"\n \"It was there,\" Edward disagreed quietly. \"I\u0027m surprised it\u0027s come to this so soon, because the other thoughts were stronger. In Aro\u0027s head he saw me at his one side and Alice at his other. The present and the future, virtual omniscience. The power of the idea intoxicated him. I would have thought it would take him much longer to give up on that plan - he wanted it too much. But there was also the thought of you, Carlisle, of our family, growing stronger and larger. The jealousy and the fear: you having . . . not more than he had, but still, things that he wanted. He tried not to think about it, but he couldn\u0027t hide it completely. The idea of rooting out the competition was there; besides their own, ours is the largest coven they\u0027ve ever found. . . .\"\n I stared at his face in horror. He\u0027d never told me this, but I guessed I knew why. I could see it in my head now, Aro\u0027s dream. Edward and Alice in black, flowing robes, drifting along at Aro\u0027s side with their eyes cold and blood-red. . . .\n Carlisle interrupted my waking nightmare. \"They\u0027re too committed to their mission. They would never break the rules themselves. It goes against everything they\u0027ve worked for.\"\n \"They\u0027ll clean up afterward. A double betrayal,\" Edward said in a grim voice. \"No harm done.\"\n Jasper leaned forward, shaking his head. \"No, Carlisle is right. The Volturi do not break rules. Besides, it\u0027s much too sloppy. This . . . person, this threat - they have no idea what they\u0027re doing. A first-timer, I\u0027d swear to it. I cannot believe the Volturi are involved. But they will be.\"\n They all stared at each other, frozen with stress.\n \"Then let\u0027s go,\" Emmett almost roared. \"What are we waiting for?\"\n Carlisle and Edward exchanged a long glance. Edward nodded once.\n \"We\u0027ll need you to teach us, Jasper,\" Carlisle finally said. \"How to destroy them.\" Carlisle\u0027s jaw was hard, but I could see the pain in his eyes as he said the words. No one hated violence more than Carlisle.\n There was something bothering me, and I couldn\u0027t put my finger on it. I was numb, horrified, deathly afraid. And yet, under that, I could feel that I was missing something important. Something that would make some sense out of the chaos. That would explain it.\n \"We\u0027re going to need help,\" Jasper said. \"Do you think Tanya\u0027s family would be willing . . . ? Another five mature vampires would make an enormous difference. And then Kate and Eleazar would be especially advantageous on our side. It would be almost easy, with their aid.\"\n \"We\u0027ll ask,\" Carlisle answered.\n Jasper held out a cell phone. \"We need to hurry.\"\n I\u0027d never seen Carlisle\u0027s innate calm so shaken. He took the phone, and paced toward the windows. He dialed a number, held the phone to his ear, and laid the other hand against the glass. He stared out into the foggy morning with a pained and ambivalent expression.\n Edward took my hand and pulled me to the white loveseat. I sat beside him, staring at his face while he stared at Carlisle.\n Carlisle\u0027s voice was low and quick, difficult to hear. I heard him greet Tanya, and then he raced through the situation too fast for me to understand much, though I could tell that the Alaskan vampires were not ignorant of what was going on in Seattle.\n Then something changed in Carlisle\u0027s voice.\n \"Oh,\" he said, his voice sharper in surprise. \"We didn\u0027t realize . . . that Irina felt that way.\"\n Edward groaned at my side and closed his eyes. \"Damn it. Damn Laurent to the deepest pit of hell where he belongs.\"\n \"Laurent?\" I whispered, the blood emptying from my face, but Edward didn\u0027t respond, focused on Carlisle\u0027s thoughts.\n My short encounter with Laurent early this spring was not something that had faded or dimmed in my mind. I still remembered every word he\u0027d said before Jacob and his pack had interrupted.\n I actually came here as a favor to her. . . .\n Victoria. Laurent had been her first maneuver - she\u0027d sent him to observe, to see how hard it might be to get to me. He hadn\u0027t survived the wolves to report back.\n Though he\u0027d kept up his old ties with Victoria after James\u0027s death, he\u0027d also formed new ties and new relationships. He\u0027d gone to live with Tanya\u0027s family in Alaska - Tanya the strawberry blonde - the closest friends the Cullens had in the vampire world, practically extended family. Laurent had been with them for almost a year previous to his death.\n Carlisle was still talking, his voice not quite pleading. Persuasive, but with an edge. Then the edge abruptly won out over the persuasion.\n \"There\u0027s no question of that,\" Carlisle said in a stern voice. \"We have a truce. They haven\u0027t broken it, and neither will we. I\u0027m sorry to hear that. . . . Of course. We\u0027ll just have to do our best alone.\"\n Carlisle shut the phone without waiting for an answer. He continued to stare out into the fog.\n \"What\u0027s the problem?\" Emmett murmured to Edward.\n \"Irina was more involved with our friend Laurent than we knew. She\u0027s holding a grudge against the wolves for destroying him to save Bella. She wants -\" He paused, looking down at me.\n \"Go on,\" I said as evenly as I could.\n His eyes tightened. \"She wants revenge. To take down the pack. They would trade their help for our permission.\"\n \"No!\" I gasped.\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" he told me in a flat voice. \"Carlisle would never agree to it.\" He hesitated, then sighed. \"Nor would I. Laurent had it coming\" - this was almost a growl - \"and I still owe the wolves for that.\"\n \"This isn\u0027t good,\" Jasper said. \"It\u0027s too even a fight. We\u0027d have the upper hand in skill, but not numbers. We\u0027d win, but at what price?\" His tense eyes flashed to Alice\u0027s face and away.\n I wanted to scream out loud as I grasped what Jasper meant.\n We would win, but we would lose. Some wouldn\u0027t survive.\n I looked around the room at their faces - Jasper, Alice, Emmett, Rose, Esme, Carlisle . . . Edward - the faces of my family. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-14.html","bookId":2025,"book":{"id":2025,"title":"The Twilight Saga 3: Eclipse (Twilight #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Readers captivated by Twilight and New Moon will eagerly devour the paperback edition Eclipse, the third book in Stephenie Meyer\u0027s riveting vampire love saga.
