{"id":107898,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"I WAS HAVING A BAD WEEK.\n I knew that essentially nothing had changed. Okay, so Victoria had not given up, but had I ever dreamed for one moment that she had? Her reappearance had only confirmed what I\u0027d already known. No reason for fresh panic.\n In theory. Not panicking was easier said than done.\n Graduation was only a few weeks away, but I wondered if it wasn\u0027t a little foolish to sit around, weak and tasty, waiting for the next disaster. It seemed too dangerous to be human - just begging for trouble. Someone like me shouldn\u0027t be human. Someone with my luck ought to be a little less helpless.\n But no one would listen to me.\n Carlisle had said, \"There are seven of us, Bella. And with Alice on our side, I don\u0027t think Victoria\u0027s going to catch us off guard. I think it\u0027s important, for Charlie\u0027s sake, that we stick with the original plan.\"\n Esme had said, \"We\u0027d never allow anything to happen to you, sweetheart. You know that. Please don\u0027t be anxious.\" And then she\u0027d kissed my forehead.\n Emmett had said, \"I\u0027m really glad Edward didn\u0027t kill you. Everything\u0027s so much more fun with you around.\"\n Rosalie had glared at him.\n Alice had rolled her eyes and said, \"I\u0027m offended. You\u0027re not honestly worried about this, are you?\"\n \"If it\u0027s no big deal, then why did Edward drag me to Florida?\" I\u0027d demanded.\n \"Haven\u0027t you noticed yet, Bella, that Edward is just the teeniest bit prone to overreaction?\"\n Jasper had silently erased all the panic and tension in my body with his curious talent of controlling emotional atmospheres. I\u0027d felt reassured, and let them talk me out of my desperate pleading.\n Of course, that calm had worn off as soon as Edward and I had walked out of the room.\n So the consensus was that I was just supposed to forget that a deranged vampire was stalking me, intent on my death. Go about my business.\n I did try. And surprisingly, there were other things almost as stressful to dwell on besides my status on the endangered species list. . . .\n Because Edward\u0027s response had been the most frustrating of them all.\n \"That\u0027s between you and Carlisle,\" he\u0027d said. \"Of course, you know that I\u0027m willing to make it between you and me at any time that you wish. You know my condition.\" And he had smiled angelically.\n Ugh. I did know his condition. Edward had promised that he would change me himself whenever I wanted . . . just as long as I was married to him first.\n Sometimes I wondered if he was only pretending that he couldn\u0027t read my mind. How else had he struck upon the one condition that I would have trouble accepting? The one condition that would slow me down.\n All in all, a very bad week. And today was the worst day in it.\n It was always a bad day when Edward was away. Alice had foreseen nothing out of the ordinary this weekend, and so I\u0027d insisted that he take the opportunity to go hunting with his brothers. I knew how it bored him to hunt the easy, nearby prey.\n \"Go have fun,\" I\u0027d told him. \"Bag a few mountain lions for me.\"\n I would never admit to him how hard it was for me when he was gone - how it brought back the abandonment nightmares. If he knew that, it would make him feel horrible and he would be afraid to ever leave me, even for the most necessary reasons. It had been like that in the beginning, when he\u0027d first returned from Italy. His golden eyes had turned black and he\u0027d suffered from his thirst more than it was already necessary that he suffer. So I put on a brave face and all but kicked him out the door whenever Emmett and Jasper wanted to go.\n I think he saw through me, though. A little. This morning there had been a note left on my pillow:\n I\u0027ll be back so soon you won\u0027t have time to miss me. Look after my heart - I\u0027ve left it with you.\n So now I had a big empty Saturday with nothing but my morning shift at Newton\u0027s Olympic Outfitters to distract me. And, of course, the oh-so-comforting promise from Alice.\n \"I\u0027m staying close to home to hunt. I\u0027ll only be fifteen minutes away if you need me. I\u0027ll keep an eye out for trouble.\"\n Translation: don\u0027t try anything funny just because Edward is gone.\n Alice was certainly just as capable of crippling my truck as Edward was.\n I tried to look on the bright side. After work, I had plans to help Angela with her announcements, so that would be a distraction. And Charlie was in an excellent mood due to Edward\u0027s absence, so I might as well enjoy that while it lasted. Alice would spend the night with me if I was pathetic enough to ask her to. And then tomorrow, Edward would be home. I would survive.\n Not wanting to be ridiculously early for work, I ate my breakfast slowly, one Cheerio at a time. Then, when I\u0027d washed the dishes, I arranged the magnets on the fridge into a perfect line. Maybe I was developing obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n The last two magnets - round black utilitarian pieces that were my favorites because they could hold ten sheets of paper to the fridge without breaking a sweat - did not want to cooperate with my fixation. Their polarities were reversed; every time I tried to line the last one up, the other jumped out of place.\n For some reason - impending mania, perhaps - this really irritated me. Why couldn\u0027t they just play nice? Stupid with stubbornness, I kept shoving them together as if I was expecting them to suddenly give up. I could have flipped one over, but that felt like losing. Finally, exasperated at myself more than the magnets, I pulled them from the fridge and held them together with two hands. It took a little effort - they were strong enough to put up a fight - but I forced them to coexist side-by-side.\n \"See,\" I said out loud - talking to inanimate objects, never a good sign - \"That\u0027s not so horrible, is it?\"\n I stood there like an idiot for a second, not quite able to admit that I wasn\u0027t having any lasting effect against scientific principles. Then, with a sigh, I put the magnets back on the fridge, a foot apart.\n \"There\u0027s no need to be so inflexible,\" I muttered.\n It was still too early, but I decided I\u0027d better get out of the house before the inanimate objects started talking back.\n When I got to Newton\u0027s, Mike was methodically dry mopping the aisles while his mom arranged a new counter display. I caught them in the middle of an argument, unaware that I had arrived.\n \"But it\u0027s the only time that Tyler can go,\" Mike complained. \"You said after graduation -\"\n \"You\u0027re just going to have to wait,\" Mrs. Newton snapped. \"You and Tyler can think of something else to do. You are not going to Seattle until the police stop whatever it is that is going on there. I know Beth Crowley has told Tyler the same thing, so don\u0027t act like I\u0027m the bad guy - oh, good morning, Bella,\" she said when she caught sight of me, brightening her tone quickly. \"You\u0027re early.\"\n Karen Newton was the last person I\u0027d think to ask for help in an outdoor sports equipment store. Her perfectly highlighted blond hair was always smoothed into an elegant twist on the back of her neck, her fingernails were polished by professionals, as were her toenails - visible through the strappy high heels that didn\u0027t resemble anything Newton\u0027s offered on the long row of hiking boots.\n \"Light traffic,\" I joked as I grabbed my hideous fluorescent orange vest out from under the counter. I was surprised that Mrs. Newton was as worked up about this Seattle thing as Charlie. I\u0027d thought he was going to extremes.\n \"Well, er . . .\" Mrs. Newton hesitated for a moment, playing uncomfortably with a stack of flyers she was arranging by the register.\n I stopped with one arm in my vest. I knew that look.\n When I\u0027d let the Newtons know that I wouldn\u0027t be working here this summer - abandoning them in their busiest season, in effect - they\u0027d started training Katie Marshall to take my place. They couldn\u0027t really afford both of us on the payroll at the same time, so when it looked like a slow day . . .\n \"I was going to call,\" Mrs. Newton continued. \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027re expecting a ton of business today. Mike and I can probably handle things. I\u0027m sorry you got up and drove out. . . .\"\n On a normal day, I would be ecstatic with this turn of events. Today . . . not so much.\n \"Okay,\" I sighed. My shoulders slumped. What was I going to do now?\n \"That\u0027s not fair, Mom,\" Mike said. \"If Bella wants to work -\"\n \"No, it\u0027s okay, Mrs. Newton. Really, Mike. I\u0027ve got finals to study for and stuff. . . .\" I didn\u0027t want to be a source of familial discord when they were already arguing.\n \"Thanks, Bella. Mike, you missed aisle four. Um, Bella, do you mind throwing these flyers in a Dumpster on the way out? I told the girl who left them here that I\u0027d put them on the counter, but I really don\u0027t have the room.\"\n \"Sure, no problem.\" I put my vest away, and then tucked the flyers under my arm and headed out into the misty rain.\n The Dumpster was around the side of Newton\u0027s, next to where we employees were supposed to park. I shuffled along, kicking pebbles petulantly on my way. I was about to fling the stack of bright yellow papers into the trash when the heading printed in bold across the top caught my eye. One word in particular seized my attention.\n I clutched the papers in both hands as I stared at the picture beneath the caption. A lump rose in my throat.\n SAVE THE OLYMPIC WOLF\n Under the words, there was a detailed drawing of a wolf in front of a fir tree, its head thrown back in the act of baying at the moon. It was a disconcerting picture; something about the wolf\u0027s plaintive posture made him look forlorn. Like he was howling in grief.\n And then I was running to my truck, the flyers still locked in my grip.\n Fifteen minutes - that\u0027s all I had. But it should be long enough. It was only fifteen minutes to La Push, and surely I would cross the boundary line a few minutes before I hit the town.\n My truck roared to life without any difficulty.\n Alice couldn\u0027t have seen me doing this, because I hadn\u0027t been planning it. A snap decision, that was the key! And as long as I moved fast enough, I should be able to capitalize on it.\n I\u0027d thrown the damp flyers in my haste and they were scattered in a bright mess across the passenger seat - a hundred bolded captions, a hundred dark howling wolves outlined against the yellow background.\n I barreled down the wet highway, turning the windshield wipers on high and ignoring the groan of the ancient engine. Fifty-five was the most I could coax out of my truck, and I prayed it would be enough.\n I had no clue where the boundary line was, but I began to feel safer as I passed the first houses outside La Push. This must be beyond where Alice was allowed to follow.\n I\u0027d call her when I got to Angela\u0027s this afternoon, I reasoned, so that she\u0027d know I was fine. There was no reason for her to get worked up. She didn\u0027t need to be mad at me - Edward would be angry enough for two when he got back.\n My truck was positively wheezing by the time it grated to a stop in front of the familiar faded red house. The lump came back to my throat as I stared at the little place that had once been my refuge. It had been so long since I\u0027d been here.\n Before I could cut the engine, Jacob was standing in the door, his face blank with shock.\n In the sudden silence when the truck-roar died, I heard him gasp.\n \"Bella?\"\n \"Hey, Jake!\"\n \"Bella!\" he yelled back, and the smile I\u0027d been waiting for stretched across his face like the sun breaking free of the clouds. His teeth gleamed bright against his russet skin. \"I can\u0027t believe it!\"\n He ran to the truck and half-yanked me through the open door, and then we were both jumping up and down like kids.\n \"How did you get here?\"\n \"I snuck out!\"\n \"Awesome!\"\n \"Hey, Bella!\" Billy had rolled himself into the doorway to see what all the commotion was about.\n \"Hey, Bil -!\"\n Just then my air choked off - Jacob grabbed me up in a bear hug too tight to breathe and swung me around in a circle.\n \"Wow, it\u0027s good to see you here!\"\n \"Can\u0027t . . . breathe,\" I gasped.\n He laughed and put me down.\n \"Welcome back, Bella,\" he said, grinning. And the way he said the words made it sound like welcome home.\n We started walking, too keyed up to sit still in the house. Jacob was practically bouncing as he moved, and I had to remind him a few times that my legs weren\u0027t ten feet long.\n As we walked, I felt myself settling into another version of myself, the self I had been with Jacob. A little younger, a little less responsible. Someone who might, on occasion, do something really stupid for no good reason.\n Our exuberance lasted through the first few topics of conversation: how we were doing, what we were up to, how long I had, and what had brought me here. When I hesitantly told him about the wolf flyer, his bellowing laugh echoed back from the trees.\n But then, as we ambled past the back of the store and shoved through the thick scrub that ringed the far edge of First Beach, we got to the hard parts. All too soon we had to talk about the reasons behind our long separation, and I watched as the face of my friend hardened into the bitter mask that was already too familiar.\n \"So what\u0027s the story, anyway?\" Jacob asked me, kicking a piece of driftwood out of his way with too much force. It sailed over the sand and then clattered against the rocks. \"I mean, since the last time we . . . well, before, you know . . .\" He struggled for the words. He took a deep breath and tried again. \"What I\u0027m asking is . . . everything is just back to the way it was before he left? You forgave him for all of that?\"\n I took a deep breath. \"There was nothing to forgive.\"\n I wanted to skip past this part, the betrayals, the accusations, but I knew that we had to talk it through before we\u0027d be able to move on to anything else.\n Jacob\u0027s face puckered up like he\u0027d just licked a lemon. \"I wish Sam had taken a picture when he found you that night last September. It would be exhibit A.\"\n \"Nobody\u0027s on trial.\"\n \"Maybe somebody should be.\"\n \"Not even you would blame him for leaving, if you knew the reason why.\"\n He glared at me for a few seconds. \"Okay,\" he challenged acidly. \"Amaze me.\"\n His hostility was wearing on me - chafing against the raw; it hurt to have him angry with me. It reminded me of the bleak afternoon, long ago, when - under orders from Sam - he\u0027d told me we couldn\u0027t be friends. I took a second to compose myself.\n \"Edward left me last fall because he didn\u0027t think I should be hanging out with vampires. He thought it would be healthier for me if he left.\"\n Jacob did a double take. He had to scramble for a minute. Whatever he\u0027d been planning to say, it clearly no longer applied. I was glad he didn\u0027t know the catalyst behind Edward\u0027s decision. I could only imagine what he\u0027d think if he knew Jasper had tried to kill me.\n \"He came back, though, didn\u0027t he?\" Jacob muttered. \"Too bad he can\u0027t stick to a decision.\"\n \"If you remember, I went and got him.\"\n Jacob stared at me for a moment, and then he backed off. His face relaxed, and his voice was calmer when he spoke.\n \"That\u0027s true. So I never did get the story. What happened?\"\n I hesitated, biting my lip.\n \"Is it a secret?\" His voice took on a taunting edge. \"Are you not allowed to tell me?\"\n \"No,\" I snapped. \"It\u0027s just a really long story.\"\n Jacob smiled, arrogant, and turned to walk up the beach, expecting me to follow.\n It was no fun being with Jacob if he was going to act like this. I trailed behind him automatically, not sure if I shouldn\u0027t turn around and leave. I was going to have to face Alice, though, when I got home. . . . I supposed I wasn\u0027t in any rush.\n Jacob walked to a huge, familiar piece of driftwood - an entire tree, roots and all, bleached white and beached deep in the sand; it was our tree, in a way.\n Jacob sat down on the natural bench, and patted the space next to him.\n \"I don\u0027t mind long stories. Is there any action?\"\n I rolled my eyes as I sat next to him. \"There\u0027s some action,\" I allowed.\n \"It wouldn\u0027t be real horror without action.\"\n \"Horror!\" I scoffed. \"Can you listen, or will you be interrupting me with rude comments about my friends? \"\n He pretended to lock his lips and then threw the invisible key over his shoulder. I tried not to smile, and failed.\n \"I\u0027ll have to start with the stuff you were already there for,\" I decided, working to organize the stories in my head before I began.\n Jacob raised his hand.\n \"Go ahead.\"\n \"That\u0027s good,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t understand much that was going on at the time.\"\n \"Yeah, well, it gets complicated, so pay attention. You know how Alice sees things?\"\n I took his scowl - the wolves weren\u0027t thrilled that the legends of vampires possessing supernatural gifts were true - for a yes, and proceeded with the account of my race through Italy to rescue Edward.\n I kept it as succinct as possible - leaving out anything that wasn\u0027t essential. I tried to read Jacob\u0027s reactions, but his face was enigmatic as I explained how Alice had seen Edward plan to kill himself when he\u0027d heard that I was dead. Sometimes Jacob seemed so deep in thought, I wasn\u0027t sure if he was listening. He only interrupted one time.\n \"The fortune-telling bloodsucker can\u0027t see us?\" he echoed, his face both fierce and gleeful. \"Seriously? That\u0027s excellent!\"\n I clenched my teeth together, and we sat in silence, his face expectant as he waited for me to continue. I glared at him until he realized his mistake.\n \"Oops!\" he said. \"Sorry.\" He locked his lips again.\n His response was easier to read when I got to the part about the Volturi. His teeth clenched together, goose bumps rose on his arms, and his nostrils flared. I didn\u0027t go into specifics, I just told him that Edward had talked us out of trouble, without revealing the promise we\u0027d had to make, or the visit we were anticipating. Jacob didn\u0027t need to have my nightmares.\n \"Now you know the whole story,\" I concluded. \"So it\u0027s your turn to talk. What happened while I was with my mom this weekend?\" I knew Jacob would give me more details than Edward had. He wasn\u0027t afraid of scaring me.\n Jacob leaned forward, instantly animated. \"So Embry and Quil and I were running patrol on Saturday night, just routine stuff, when out of nowhere - bam!\" He threw his arms out, impersonating an explosion. \"There it is - a fresh trail, not fifteen minutes old. Sam wanted us to wait for him, but I didn\u0027t know you were gone, and I didn\u0027t know if your bloodsuckers were keeping an eye on you or not. So we took off after her at full speed, but she\u0027d crossed the treaty line before we caught up. We spread out along the line, hoping she\u0027d cross back over. It was frustrating, let me tell you.\" He wagged his head and his hair - growing out from the short crop he\u0027d adopted when he\u0027d joined the pack - flopped into his eyes. \"We ended up too far south. The Cullens chased her back to our side just a few miles north of us. Would have been the perfect ambush if we\u0027d known where to wait.\"\n He shook his head, grimacing now. \"That\u0027s when it got dicey. Sam and the others caught up to her before we did, but she was dancing right along the line, and the whole coven was right there on the other side. The big one, what\u0027s-his-name -\"\n \"Emmett.\"\n \"Yeah, him. He made a lunge for her, but that redhead is fast! He flew right behind her and almost rammed into Paul. So, Paul . . . well, you know Paul.\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"Lost his focus. Can\u0027t say that I blame him - the big bloodsucker was right on top of him. He sprang - hey, don\u0027t give me that look. The vampire was on our land.\"\n I tried to compose my face so that he would go on. My nails were digging into my palms with the stress of the story, even though I knew it had turned out fine.\n \"Anyway, Paul missed, and the big one got back on his side. But by then the, er, well the, uh, blonde . . .\" Jacob\u0027s expression was a comical mix of disgust and unwilling admiration as he tried to come up with a word to describe Edward\u0027s sister.\n \"Rosalie.\"\n \"Whatever. She got real territorial, so Sam and I fell back to get Paul\u0027s flanks. Then their leader and the other blond male -\"\n \"Carlisle and Jasper.\"\n He gave me an exasperated look. \"You know I don\u0027t really care. Anyway, so Carlisle spoke to Sam, trying to calm things down. Then it was weird, because everyone got really calm really fast. It was that other one you told me about, messing with our heads. But even though we knew what he was doing, we couldn\u0027t not be calm.\"\n \"Yeah, I know how it feels.\"\n \"Really annoying, that\u0027s how it feels. Only you can\u0027t be annoyed until afterwards.\" He shook his head angrily. \"So Sam and the head vamp agreed that Victoria was the priority, and we started after her again. Carlisle gave us the line, so that we could follow the scent properly, but then she hit the cliffs just north of Makah country, right where the line hugs the coast for a few miles. She took off into the water again. The big one and the calm one wanted permission to cross the line to go after her, but of course we said no.\"\n \"Good. I mean, you were being stupid, but I\u0027m glad. Emmett\u0027s never cautious enough. He could have gotten hurt.\"\n Jacob snorted. \"So did your vampire tell you we attacked for no reason and his totally innocent coven -\"\n \"No,\" I interrupted. \"Edward told me the same story, just without quite as many details.\"\n \"Huh,\" Jacob said under his breath, and he bent over to pick up a rock from among the millions of pebbles at our feet. With a casual flick, he sent it flying a good hundred meters out into the bay. \"Well, she\u0027ll be back, I guess. We\u0027ll get another shot at her.\"\n I shuddered; of course she would be back. Would Edward really tell me next time? I wasn\u0027t sure. I\u0027d have to keep an eye on Alice, to look for the signs that the pattern was about to repeat. . . .\n Jacob didn\u0027t seem to notice my reaction. He was staring across the waves with a thoughtful expression on his face, his broad lips pursed.\n \"What are you thinking about?\" I asked after a long, quiet time.\n \"I\u0027m thinking about what you told me. About when the fortune-teller saw you cliff jumping and thought you\u0027d committed suicide, and how it all got out of control. . . . Do you realize that if you had just waited for me like you were supposed to, then the bl - Alice wouldn\u0027t have been able to see you jump? Nothing would have changed. We\u0027d probably be in my garage right now, like any other Saturday. There wouldn\u0027t be any vampires in Forks, and you and me . . .\" He trailed off, deep in thought.\n It was disconcerting the way he said this, like it would be a good thing to have no vampires in Forks. My heart thumped unevenly at the emptiness of the picture he painted.\n \"Edward would have come back anyway.\"\n \"Are you sure about that?\" he asked, belligerent again as soon as I spoke Edward\u0027s name.\n \"Being apart . . . It didn\u0027t work out so well for either of us.\"\n He started to say something, something angry from his expression, but he stopped himself, took a breath, and began again.\n \"Did you know Sam is mad at you?\"\n \"Me?\" It took me a second. \"Oh. I see. He thinks they would have stayed away if I wasn\u0027t here.\"\n \"No. That\u0027s not it.\"\n \"What\u0027s his problem then?\"\n Jacob leaned down to scoop up another rock. He turned it over and over in his fingers; his eyes were riveted on the black stone while he spoke in a low voice.\n \"When Sam saw . . . how you were in the beginning, when Billy told them how Charlie worried when you didn\u0027t get better, and then when you started jumping off cliffs . . .\"\n I made a face. No one was ever going to let me forget that.\n Jacob\u0027s eyes flashed up to mine. \"He thought you were the one person in the world with as much reason to hate the Cullens as he does. Sam feels sort of . . . betrayed that you would just let them back into your life like they never hurt you.\"\n I didn\u0027t believe for a second that Sam was the only one who felt that way. And the acid in my voice now was for both of them.\n \"You can tell Sam to go right to -\"\n \"Look at that,\" Jacob interrupted me, pointing to an eagle in the act of plummeting down toward the ocean from an incredible height. It checked itself at the last minute, only its talons breaking the surface of the waves, just for an instant. Then it flapped away, its wings straining against the load of the huge fish it had snagged.\n \"You see it everywhere,\" Jacob said, his voice suddenly distant. \"Nature taking its course - hunter and prey, the endless cycle of life and death.\"\n I didn\u0027t understand the point of the nature lecture; I guessed that he was just trying to change the subject. But then he looked down at me with dark humor in his eyes.\n \"And yet, you don\u0027t see the fish trying to plant a kiss on the eagle. You never see that.\" He grinned a mocking grin.\n I grinned back tightly, though the acid taste was still in my mouth. \"Maybe the fish was trying,\" I suggested. \"It\u0027s hard to tell what a fish is thinking. Eagles are good-looking birds, you know.\"\n \"Is that what it comes down to?\" His voice was abruptly sharper. \"Good looks?\"\n \"Don\u0027t be stupid, Jacob.\"\n \"Is it the money, then?\" he persisted.\n \"That\u0027s nice,\" I muttered, getting up from the tree. \"I\u0027m flattered that you think so much of me.\" I turned my back on him and paced away.\n \"Aw, don\u0027t get mad.\" He was right behind me; he caught my wrist and spun me around. \"I\u0027m serious! I\u0027m trying to understand here, and I\u0027m coming up blank.\"\n His eyebrows pushed together angrily, and his eyes were black in their deep shadow.\n \"I love him. Not because he\u0027s beautiful or because he\u0027s rich!\" I spat the word at Jacob. \"I\u0027d much rather he weren\u0027t either one. It would even out the gap between us just a little bit - because he\u0027d still be the most loving and unselfish and brilliant and decent person I\u0027ve ever met. Of course I love him. How hard is that to understand?\"\n \"It\u0027s impossible to understand.\"\n \"Please enlighten me, then, Jacob.\" I let the sarcasm flow thick. \"What is a valid reason for someone to love someone else? Since apparently I\u0027m doing it wrong.\"\n \"I think the best place to start would be to look within your own species. That usually works.\"\n \"Well, that just sucks!\" I snapped. \"I guess I\u0027m stuck with Mike Newton after all.\"\n Jacob flinched back and bit his lip. I could see that my words had hurt him, but I was too mad to feel bad about that yet. He dropped my wrist and folded his arms across his chest, turning from me to glare toward the ocean.\n \"I\u0027m human,\" he muttered, his voice almost inaudible.\n \"You\u0027re not as human as Mike,\" I continued ruthlessly. \"Do you still think that\u0027s the most important consideration?\"\n \"It\u0027s not the same thing.\" Jacob didn\u0027t look away from the gray waves. \"I didn\u0027t choose this.\"\n I laughed once in disbelief. \"Do you think Edward did? He didn\u0027t know what was happening to him any more than you did. He didn\u0027t exactly sign up for this.\"\n Jacob was shaking his head back and forth with a small, quick movement.\n \"You know, Jacob, you\u0027re awfully self-righteous - considering that you\u0027re a werewolf and all.\"\n \"It\u0027s not the same,\" Jacob repeated, glowering at me.\n \"I don\u0027t see why not. You could be a bit more understanding about the Cullens. You have no idea how truly good they are - to the core, Jacob.\"\n He frowned more deeply. \"They shouldn\u0027t exist. Their existence goes against nature.\"\n I stared at him for a long moment with one eyebrow raised incredulously. It was a while before he noticed.\n \"What?\"\n \"Speaking of unnatural . . . ,\" I hinted.\n \"Bella,\" he said, his voice slow and different. Aged. I realized that he sounded suddenly older than me - like a parent or a teacher. \"What I am was born in me. It\u0027s a part of who I am, who my family is, who we all are as a tribe - it\u0027s the reason why we\u0027re still here.\n \"Besides that\" - he looked down at me, his black eyes unreadable - \"I am stillhuman.\"\n He picked up my hand and pressed it to his fever-warm chest. Through his t-shirt, I could feel the steady beating of his heart under my palm.\n \"Normal humans can\u0027t throw motorcycles around the way you can.\"\n He smiled a faint, half-smile. \"Normal humans run away from monsters, Bella. And I never claimed to be normal. Just human.\"\n Staying angry with Jacob was too much work. I started to smile as I pulled my hand away from his chest.\n \"You look plenty human to me,\" I allowed. \"At the moment.\"\n \"I feel human.\" He stared past me, his face far away. His lower lip trembled, and he bit down on it hard.\n \"Oh, Jake,\" I whispered, reaching for his hand.\n This was why I was here. This was why I would take whatever reception waited for me when I got back. Because, underneath all the anger and the sarcasm, Jacob was in pain. Right now, it was very clear in his eyes. I didn\u0027t know how to help him, but I knew I had to try. It was more than that I owed him. It was because his pain hurt me, too. Jacob had become a part of me, and there was no changing that now. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-5.html","bookId":2025,"book":{"id":2025,"title":"The Twilight Saga 3: Eclipse (Twilight #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Readers captivated by Twilight and New Moon will eagerly devour the paperback edition Eclipse, the third book in Stephenie Meyer\u0027s riveting vampire love saga.
