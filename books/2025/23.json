I was fully dressed, my hiking boots still laced into place. It didn\u0027t make any difference. How could it be so cold? How could it keep getting colder? It had to bottom out sometime, didn\u0027t it?\\n\\n \"W-w-w-w-w-what t-t-t-t-time is it?\" I forced the words through my rattling teeth.\\n\\n \"Two,\" Edward answered.\\n\\n Edward sat as far from me as possible in the cramped space, afraid to even breathe on me when I was already so cold. It was too dark to see his face, but his voice was wild with worry, indecision, and frustration.\\n\\n \"Maybe . . .\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m f-f-f-f-f-fine, r-r-r-really. I don\u0027t w-w-w-want to g-go outside.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d tried to talk me into making a run for it a dozen times already, but I was terrified of leaving my shelter. If it was this cold in here, protected from the raging wind, I could imagine how bad it would be if we were running through it.\\n\\n And it would waste all our efforts this afternoon. Would we have enough time to reset ourselves when the storm was over? What if it didn\u0027t end? It made no sense to move now. I could shiver my way through one night.\\n\\n I was worried that the trail I had laid would be lost, but he promised that it would still be plain to the coming monsters.\\n\\n \"What can I do?\" he almost begged.\\n\\n I just shook my head.\\n\\n Out in the snow, Jacob whined unhappily.\\n\\n \"G-g-g-get out of h-h-h-ere,\" I ordered, again.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s just worried about you,\" Edward translated. \"He\u0027s fine. His body is equipped to deal with this.\"\\n\\n \"H-h-h-h-h-h.\" I wanted to say that he should still leave, but I couldn\u0027t get it past my teeth. I nearly bit my tongue off trying. At least Jacob did seem to be well equipped for the snow, better even than the others in his pack with his thicker, longer, shaggy russet fur. I wondered why that was.\\n\\n Jacob whimpered, a high-pitched, grating sound of complaint.\\n\\n \"What do you want me to do?\" Edward growled, too anxious to bother with politeness anymore. \"Carry her through that? I don\u0027t see you making yourself useful. Why don\u0027t you go fetch a space heater or something?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ok-k-k-k-k-k-kay,\" I protested. Judging from Edward\u0027s groan and the muted growl outside the tent, I hadn\u0027t convinced anyone. The wind rocked the tent roughly, and I shuddered in harmony with it.\\n\\n A sudden howl ripped through the roar of the wind, and I covered my ears against the noise. Edward scowled.\\n\\n \"That was hardly necessary,\" he muttered. \"And that\u0027s the worst idea I\u0027ve ever heard,\" he called more loudly.\\n\\n \"Better than anything you\u0027ve come up with,\" Jacob answered, his human voice startling me. \"Go fetch a space heater,\" he grumbled. \"I\u0027m not a St. Bernard.\"\\n\\n I heard the sound of the zipper around the tent door pulling swiftly down.\\n\\n Jacob slid through the smallest opening he could manage, while the arctic air flowed in around him, a few flecks of snow falling to the floor of the tent. I shivered so hard it was a convulsion.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like this,\" Edward hissed as Jake zipped the tent door shut. \"Just give her the coat and get out.\"\\n\\n My eyes were adjusted enough to see shapes - Jacob was carrying the parka that had been hanging on a tree next to the tent.\\n\\n I tried to ask what they were talking about, but all that came out of my mouth was, \"W-w-w-w-w-w,\" as the shivering made me stutter uncontrollably.\\n\\n \"The parka\u0027s for tomorrow - she\u0027s too cold to warm it up by herself. It\u0027s frozen.\" He dropped it by the door. \"You said she needed a space heater, and here I am.\" Jacob held his arms as wide as the tent allowed. As usual, when he\u0027d been running around as a wolf, he\u0027d only thrown on the bare essentials - just a pair of sweats, no shirt, no shoes.\\n\\n \"J-J-J-J-Jake, you\u0027ll f-f-f-freez-z-z-ze,\" I tried to complain.\\n\\n \"Not me,\" he said cheerfully. \"I run at a toasty one-oh-eight point nine these days. I\u0027ll have you sweating in no time.\"\\n\\n Edward snarled, but Jacob didn\u0027t even look at him. Instead, he crawled to my side and started unzipping my sleeping bag.\\n\\n Edward\u0027s hand was suddenly hard on his shoulder, restraining, snow white against the dark skin. Jacob\u0027s jaw clenched, his nostrils flaring, his body recoiling from the cold touch. The long muscles in his arms flexed automatically.\\n\\n \"Get your hand off of me,\" he growled through his teeth.\\n\\n \"Keep your hands off of her,\" Edward answered blackly.\\n\\n \"D-d-d-don\u0027t f-f-f-f-fight,\" I pleaded. Another tremor rocked through me. It felt like my teeth were going to shatter, they were slamming together so hard.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll thank you for this when her toes turn black and drop off,\" Jacob snapped.\\n\\n Edward hesitated, then his hand fell away and he slid back to his position in the corner.\\n\\n His voice was flat and frightening. \"Watch yourself.\"\\n\\n Jacob chuckled.\\n\\n \"Scoot over, Bella,\" he said, zipping the sleeping bag open farther.\\n\\n I stared at him in outrage. No wonder Edward was reacting this way.\\n\\n \"N-n-n-n-n,\" I tried to protest.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" he said, exasperated. \"Don\u0027t you like having ten toes?\"\\n\\n He crammed his body into the nonexistent space, forcing the zipper up behind himself.\\n\\n And then I couldn\u0027t object - I didn\u0027t want to anymore. He was so warm. His arms constricted around me, holding me snugly against his bare chest. The heat was irresistible, like air after being underwater for too long. He cringed when I pressed my icy fingers eagerly against his skin.\\n\\n \"Jeez, you\u0027re freezing, Bella,\" he complained.\\n\\n \"S-s-s-s-sorry,\" I stuttered.\\n\\n \"Try to relax,\" he suggested as another shiver rippled through me violently. \"You\u0027ll be warm in a minute. Of course, you\u0027d warm up faster if you took your clothes off.\"\\n\\n Edward growled sharply.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just a simple fact,\" Jacob defended himself. \"Survival one-oh-one.\"\\n\\n \"C-c-cut it out, Jake,\" I said angrily, though my body refused to even try to pull away from him. \"N-n-n- nobody really n-n-n-n-needs all ten t-t-t-toes.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry about the bloodsucker,\" Jacob suggested, and his tone was smug. \"He\u0027s just jealous.\"\\n\\n \"Of course I am.\" Edward\u0027s voice was velvet again, under control, a musical murmur in the darkness. \"You don\u0027t have the faintest idea how much I wish I could do what you\u0027re doing for her, mongrel.\"\\n\\n \"Those are the breaks,\" Jacob said lightly, but then his tone soured. \"At least you know she wishes it was you.\"\\n\\n \"True,\" Edward agreed.\\n\\n The shuddering slowed, became bearable while they wrangled.\\n\\n \"There,\" Jacob said, pleased. \"Feeling better?\"\\n\\n I was finally able to speak clearly. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Your lips are still blue,\" he mused. \"Want me to warm those up for you, too? You only have to ask.\"\\n\\n Edward sighed heavily.\\n\\n \"Behave yourself,\" I muttered, pressing my face against his shoulder. He flinched again when my cold skin touched his, and I smiled with slightly vindictive satisfaction.\\n\\n It was already warm and snug inside the sleeping bag. Jacob\u0027s body heat seemed to radiate from every side - maybe because there was so much of him. I kicked my boots off, and pushed my toes against his legs. He jumped slightly, and then leaned his head down to press his hot cheek against my numb ear.\\n\\n I noticed that Jacob\u0027s skin had a woodsy, musky scent - it fit the setting, here in the middle of the forest. It was nice. I wondered if the Cullens and the Quileutes weren\u0027t just playing up that whole odor issue because of their prejudices. Everyone smelled fine to me.\\n\\n The storm howled like an animal attacking the tent, but it didn\u0027t worry me now. Jacob was out of the cold, and so was I. Plus, I was simply too exhausted to worry about anything - tired from just staying awake so late, and aching from the muscle spasms. My body relaxed slowly as I thawed, piece by frozen piece, and then turned limp.\\n\\n \"Jake?\" I mumbled sleepily. \"Can I ask you something? I\u0027m not trying to be a jerk or anything, I\u0027m honestly curious.\" They were the same words he\u0027d used in my kitchen . . . how long ago was it now?\\n\\n \"Sure,\" he chuckled, remembering.\\n\\n \"Why are you so much furrier than your friends? You don\u0027t have to answer if I\u0027m being rude.\" I didn\u0027t know the rules for etiquette as they applied to werewolf culture.\\n\\n \"Because my hair is longer,\" he said, amused - my question hadn\u0027t offended him, at least. He shook his head so that his unkempt hair - grown out to his chin now - tickled my cheek.\\n\\n \"Oh.\" I was surprised, but it made sense. So that was why they\u0027d all cropped their hair in the beginning, when they joined the pack. \"Then why don\u0027t you cut it? Do you like to be shaggy?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer right away this time, and Edward laughed under his breath.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" I said, pausing to yawn. \"I didn\u0027t mean to pry. You don\u0027t have to tell me.\"\\n\\n Jacob made an annoyed sound. \"Oh, he\u0027ll tell you anyway, so I might as well. . . . I was growing my hair out because . . . it seemed like you liked it better long.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" I felt awkward. \"I, er, like it both ways, Jake. You don\u0027t need to be . . . inconvenienced.\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"Turns out it was very convenient tonight, so don\u0027t worry about it.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have anything else to say. As the silence lengthened, my eyelids drooped and shut, and my breathing grew slower, more even.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, honey, go to sleep,\" Jacob whispered.\\n\\n I sighed, content, already half-unconscious.\\n\\n \"Seth is here,\" Edward muttered to Jacob, and I suddenly understood the point of the howling.\\n\\n \"Perfect. Now you can keep an eye on everything else, while I take care of your girlfriend for you.\"\\n\\n Edward didn\u0027t answer, but I groaned groggily. \"Stop it,\" I muttered.\\n\\n It was quiet then, inside at least. Outside, the wind shrieked insanely through the trees. The shimmying of the tent made it hard to sleep. The poles would suddenly jerk and quiver, pulling me back from the edge of unconsciousness each time I was close to slipping under. I felt so bad for the wolf, the boy that was stuck outside in the snow.\\n\\n My mind wandered as I waited for sleep to find me. This warm little space made me think of the early days with Jacob, and I remembered how it used to be when he was my replacement sun, the warmth that made my empty life livable. It had been a while since I\u0027d thought of Jake that way, but here he was, warming me again.\\n\\n \"Please!\" Edward hissed. \"Do you mind!\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Jacob whispered back, his tone surprised.\\n\\n \"Do you think you could attempt to control your thoughts?\" Edward\u0027s low whisper was furious.\\n\\n \"No one said you had to listen,\" Jacob muttered, defiant, yet still embarrassed. \"Get out of my head.\"\\n\\n \"I wish I could. You have no idea how loud your little fantasies are. It\u0027s like you\u0027re shouting them at me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try to keep it down,\" Jacob whispered sarcastically.\\n\\n There was a brief moment of silence.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Edward answered an unspoken thought in a murmur so low I barely made it out. \"I\u0027m jealous of that, too.\"\\n\\n \"I figured it was like that,\" Jacob whispered smugly. \"Sort of evens the playing field up a little, doesn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Edward chuckled. \"In your dreams.\"\\n\\n \"You know, she could still change her mind,\" Jacob taunted him. \"Considering all the things I could do with her that you can\u0027t. At least, not without killing her, that is.\"\\n\\n \"Go to sleep, Jacob,\" Edward murmured. \"You\u0027re starting to get on my nerves.\"\\n\\n \"I think I will. I\u0027m really very comfortable.\"\\n\\n Edward didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n I was too far gone to ask them to stop talking about me like I wasn\u0027t there. The conversation had taken on a dreamlike quality to me, and I wasn\u0027t sure I was really awake.\\n\\n \"Maybe I would,\" Edward said after a moment, answering a question I hadn\u0027t heard.\\n\\n \"But would you be honest?\"\\n\\n \"You can always ask and see.\" Edward\u0027s tone made me wonder if I was missing out on a joke.\\n\\n \"Well, you see inside my head - let me see inside yours tonight, it\u0027s only fair,\" Jacob said.\\n\\n \"Your head is full of questions. Which one do you want me to answer?\"\\n\\n \"The jealousy . . . it has to be eating at you. You can\u0027t be as sure of yourself as you seem. Unless you have no emotions at all.\"\\n\\n \"Of course it is,\" Edward agreed, no longer amused. \"Right now it\u0027s so bad that I can barely control my voice. Of course, it\u0027s even worse when she\u0027s away from me, with you, and I can\u0027t see her.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think about it all the time?\" Jacob whispered. \"Does it make it hard to concentrate when she\u0027s not with you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes and no,\" Edward said; he seemed determined to answer honestly. \"My mind doesn\u0027t work quite the same as yours. I can think of many more things at one time. Of course, that means that I\u0027m always able to think of you, always able to wonder if that\u0027s where her mind is, when she\u0027s quiet and thoughtful.\"\\n\\n They were both still for a minute.\\n\\n \"Yes, I would guess that she thinks about you often,\" Edward murmured in response to Jacob\u0027s thoughts. \"More often than I like. She worries that you\u0027re unhappy. Not that you don\u0027t know that. Not that you don\u0027t use that.\"\\n\\n \"I have to use whatever I can,\" Jacob muttered. \"I\u0027m not working with your advantages - advantages like her knowing she\u0027s in love with you.\"\\n\\n \"That helps,\" Edward agreed in a mild tone.\\n\\n Jacob was defiant. \"She\u0027s in love with me, too, you know.\"\\n\\n Edward didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n Jacob sighed. \"But she doesn\u0027t know it.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t tell you if you\u0027re right.\"\\n\\n \"Does that bother you? Do you wish you could see what she\u0027s thinking, too?\"\\n\\n \"Yes . . . and no, again. She likes it better this way, and, though it sometimes drives me insane, I\u0027d rather she was happy.\"\\n\\n The wind ripped around the tent, shaking it like an earthquake. Jacob\u0027s arms tightened around me protectively.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Edward whispered. \"Odd as this might sound, I suppose I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here, Jacob.\"\\n\\n \"You mean, \u0027as much as I\u0027d love to kill you, I\u0027m glad she\u0027s warm,\u0027 right?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an uncomfortable truce, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Jacob\u0027s whisper was suddenly smug. \"I knew you were just as crazy jealous as I am.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not such a fool as to wear it on my sleeve like you do. It doesn\u0027t help your case, you know.\"\\n\\n \"You have more patience than I do.\"\\n\\n \"I should. I\u0027ve had a hundred years to gain it. A hundred years of waiting for her.\"\\n\\n \"So . . . at what point did you decide to play the very patient good guy?\"\\n\\n \"When I saw how much it was hurting her to make her choose. It\u0027s not usually this difficult to control. I can smother the . . . less civilized feelings I may have for you fairly easily most of the time. Sometimes I think she sees through me, but I can\u0027t be sure.\"\\n\\n \"I think you were just worried that if you really forced her to choose, she might not choose you.\"\\n\\n Edward didn\u0027t answer right away. \"That was a part of it,\" he finally admitted. \"But only a small part. We all have our moments of doubt. Mostly I was worried that she\u0027d hurt herself trying to sneak away to see you. After I\u0027d accepted that she was more or less safe with you - as safe as Bella ever is - it seemed best to stop driving her to extremes.\"\\n\\n Jacob sighed. \"I\u0027d tell her all of this, but she\u0027d never believe me.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" It sounded like Edward was smiling.\\n\\n \"You think you know everything,\" Jacob muttered.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know the future,\" Edward said, his voice suddenly unsure.\\n\\n There was a long pause.\\n\\n \"What would you do if she changed her mind?\" Jacob asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that either.\"\\n\\n Jacob chuckled quietly. \"Would you try to kill me?\" Sarcastic again, as if doubting Edward\u0027s ability to do it.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" Jacob\u0027s tone was still jeering.\\n\\n \"Do you really think I would hurt her that way?\"\\n\\n Jacob hesitated for a second, and then sighed. \"Yeah, you\u0027re right. I know that\u0027s right. But sometimes . . .\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes it\u0027s an intriguing idea.\"\\n\\n Jacob pressed his face into the sleeping bag to muffle his laugher. \"Exactly,\" he eventually agreed.\\n\\n What a strange dream this was. I wondered if it was the relentless wind that made me imagine all the whispering. Only the wind was screaming rather than whispering . . .\\n\\n \"What is it like? Losing her?\" Jacob asked after a quiet moment, and there was no hint of humor in his suddenly hoarse voice. \"When you thought that you\u0027d lost her forever? How did you . . . cope?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s very difficult for me to talk about.\"\\n\\n Jacob waited.\\n\\n \"There were two different times that I thought that.\" Edward spoke each word just a little slower than normal. \"The first time, when I thought I could leave her . . . that was . . . almost bearable. Because I thought she would forget me and it would be like I hadn\u0027t touched her life. For over six months I was able to stay away, to keep my promise that I wouldn\u0027t interfere again. It was getting close - I was fighting but I knew I wasn\u0027t going to win; I would have come back . . . just to check on her. That\u0027s what I would have told myself, anyway. And if I\u0027d found her reasonably happy . . . I like to think that I could have gone away again.\\n\\n \"But she wasn\u0027t happy. And I would have stayed. That\u0027s how she convinced me to stay with her tomorrow, of course. You were wondering about that before, what could possibly motivate me . . . what she was feeling so needlessly guilty about. She reminded me of what it did to her when I left - what it still does to her when I leave. She feels horrible about bringing that up, but she\u0027s right. I\u0027ll never be able to make up for that, but I\u0027ll never stop trying anyway.\"\\n\\n Jacob didn\u0027t respond for a moment, listening to the storm or digesting what he\u0027d heard, I didn\u0027t know which.\\n\\n \"And the other time - when you thought she was dead?\" Jacob whispered roughly.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Edward answered a different question. \"It will probably feel like that to you, won\u0027t it? The way you perceive us, you might not be able to see her as Bella anymore. But that\u0027s who she\u0027ll be.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not what I asked.\"\\n\\n Edward\u0027s voice came back fast and hard. \"I can\u0027t tell you how it felt. There aren\u0027t words.\"\\n\\n Jacob\u0027s arms flexed around me.\\n\\n \"But you left because you didn\u0027t want to make her a bloodsucker. You want her to be human.\"\\n\\n Edward spoke slowly. \"Jacob, from the second that I realized that I loved her, I knew there were only four possibilities. The first alternative, the best one for Bella, would be if she didn\u0027t feel as strongly for me - if she got over me and moved on. I would accept that, though it would never change the way I felt. You think of me as a . . . living stone - hard and cold. That\u0027s true. We are set the way we are, and it is very rare for us to experience a real change. When that happens, as when Bella entered my life, it is a permanent change. There\u0027s no going back. . . .\\n\\n \"The second alternative, the one I\u0027d originally chosen, was to stay with her throughout her human life. It wasn\u0027t a good option for her, to waste her life with someone who couldn\u0027t be human with her, but it was the alternative I could most easily face. Knowing all along that, when she died, I would find a way to die, too. Sixty years, seventy years - it would seem like a very, very short time to me. . . . But then it proved much too dangerous for her to live in such close proximity with my world. It seemed like everything that could go wrong did. Or hung over us . . . waiting to go wrong. I was terrified that I wouldn\u0027t get those sixty years if I stayed near her while she was human.\\n\\n \"So I chose option three. Which turned out to be the worst mistake of my very long life, as you know. I chose to take myself out of her world, hoping to force her into the first alternative. It didn\u0027t work, and it very nearly killed us both.\\n\\n \"What do I have left but the fourth option? It\u0027s what she wants - at least, she thinks she does. I\u0027ve been trying to delay her, to give her time to find a reason to change her mind, but she\u0027s very . . . stubborn. You know that. I\u0027ll be lucky to stretch this out a few more months. She has a horror of getting older, and her birthday is in September. . . .\"\\n\\n \"I like option one,\" Jacob muttered.\\n\\n Edward didn\u0027t respond.\\n\\n \"You know exactly how much I hate to accept this,\" Jacob whispered slowly, \"but I can see that you do love her . . . in your way. I can\u0027t argue with that anymore.\\n\\n \"Given that, I don\u0027t think you should give up on the first alternative, not yet. I think there\u0027s a very good chance that she would be okay. After time. You know, if she hadn\u0027t jumped off a cliff in March . . . and if you\u0027d waited another six months to check on her. . . . Well, you might have found her reasonably happy. I had a game plan.\"\\n\\n Edward chuckled. \"Maybe it would have worked. It was a well thought-out plan.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Jake sighed. \"But . . . ,\" suddenly he was whispering so fast the words got tangled, \"give me a year, bl - Edward. I really think I could make her happy. She\u0027s stubborn, no one knows that better than I do, but she\u0027s capable of healing. She would have healed before. And she could be human, with Charlie and Ren��e, and she could grow up, and have kids and . . . be Bella.\\n\\n \"You love her enough that you have to see the advantages of that plan. She thinks you\u0027re very unselfish . . . are you really? Can you consider the idea that I might be better for her than you are?\"\\n\\n \"I have considered it,\" Edward answered quietly. \"In some ways, you would be better suited for her than another human. Bella takes some looking after, and you\u0027re strong enough that you could protect her from herself, and from everything that conspires against her. You have done that already, and I\u0027ll owe you for that for as long as I live - forever - whichever comes first. . . .\\n\\n \"I even asked Alice if she could see that - see if Bella would be better off with you. She couldn\u0027t, of course. She can\u0027t see you, and then Bella\u0027s sure of her course, for now.\\n\\n \"But I\u0027m not stupid enough to make the same mistake I made before, Jacob. I won\u0027t try to force her into that first option again. As long as she wants me, I\u0027m here.\"\\n\\n \"And if she were to decide that she wanted me?\" Jacob challenged. \"Okay, it\u0027s a long shot, I\u0027ll give you that.\"\\n\\n \"I would let her go.\"\\n\\n \"Just like that?\"\\n\\n \"In the sense that I\u0027d never show her how hard it was for me, yes. But I would keep watch. You see, Jacob, you might leave her someday. Like Sam and Emily, you wouldn\u0027t have a choice. I would always be waiting in the wings, hoping for that to happen.\"\\n\\n Jacob snorted quietly. \"Well, you\u0027ve been much more honest than I had any right to expect . . . Edward. Thanks for letting me in your head.\"\\n\\n \"As I said, I\u0027m feeling oddly grateful for your presence in her life tonight. It was the least I could do. . . . You know, Jacob, if it weren\u0027t for the fact that we\u0027re natural enemies and that you\u0027re also trying to steal away the reason for my existence, I might actually like you.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe . . . if you weren\u0027t a disgusting vampire who was planning to suck out the life of the girl I love . . . well, no, not even then.\"\\n\\n Edward chuckled.\\n\\n \"Can I ask you something?\" Edward said after a moment.\\n\\n \"Why would you have to ask?\"\\n\\n \"I can only hear if you think of it. It\u0027s just a story that Bella seemed reluctant to tell me about the other day. Something about a third wife . . . ?\"\\n\\n \"What about it?\"\\n\\n Edward didn\u0027t answer, listening to the story in Jacob\u0027s head. I heard his low hiss in the darkness.\\n\\n \"What?\" Jacob demanded again.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Edward seethed. \"Of course! I rather wish your elders had kept that story to themselves, Jacob.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t like the leeches being painted as the bad guys?\" Jacob mocked. \"You know, they are. Then and now.\"\\n\\n \"I really couldn\u0027t care less about that part. Can\u0027t you guess which character Bella would identify with?\"\\n\\n It took Jacob a minute. \"Oh. Ugh. The third wife. Okay, I see your point.\"\\n\\n \"She wants to be there in the clearing. To do what little she can, as she puts it.\" He sighed. \"That was the secondary reason for my staying with her tomorrow. She\u0027s quite inventive when she wants something.\"\\n\\n \"You know, your military brother gave her the idea just as much as the story did.\"\\n\\n \"Neither side meant any harm,\" Edward whispered, peace-making now.\\n\\n \"And when does this little truce end?\" Jacob asked. \"First light? Or do we wait until after the fight?\"\\n\\n There was a pause as they both considered.\\n\\n \"First light,\" they whispered together, and then laughed quietly.\\n\\n \"Sleep well, Jacob,\" Edward murmured. \"Enjoy the moment.\"\\n\\n It was quiet again, and the tent held still for a few minutes. The wind seemed to have decided that it wasn\u0027t going to flatten us after all, and was giving up the fight.\\n\\n Edward groaned softly. \"I didn\u0027t mean that quite so literally.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" Jacob whispered. \"You could leave, you know - give us a little privacy.\"\\n\\n \"Would you like me to help you sleep, Jacob?\" Edward offered.\\n\\n \"You could try,\" Jacob said, unconcerned. \"It would be interesting to see who walked away, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tempt me too far, wolf. My patience isn\u0027t that perfect.\"\\n\\n Jacob whispered a laugh. \"I\u0027d rather not move just now, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\\n\\n Edward started humming to himself, louder than usual - trying to drown out Jacob\u0027s thoughts, I assumed.
