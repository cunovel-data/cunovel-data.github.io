She trembled, mentally reviewing emergency procedures.\\n\\n The bullet had entered Jack’s shoulder, and when she tore aside his shirt, she saw that the wound still bled profusely. She also realized he was close to going into shock. Getting to her feet, she went below and grabbed a pillow, blankets, clean towels.\\n\\n She settled the pillow beneath his shoulders, wrapped him snugly from stomach to feet in the blankets, then pressed a towel to the wound, holding it firmly in place. Once the bleeding had slowed, she was able to examine the wound more carefully. Fortunately the bullet hadn’t struck his chest, so she didn’t have to worry about his lungs. Nor had it severed an artery.\\n\\n One step at a time, she reminded herself. One tiny step at a time. You can do this. You can do this. She repeated the words like a mantra, hoping they’d bolster her confidence. The last thing Jack needed now was for her to panic.\\n\\n “Oh, Jack,” she sobbed, brushing the unruly hair from his forehead. She blamed herself; if she’d gotten the right gun, none of this would’ve happened. She could have saved Jack. Instead, he might die and it would be all her fault.\\n\\n She refused to dwell on her own fears and regrets. What she had to concentrate on now was helping Jack, following the right procedures…not failing him again. Blessedly he was unconscious; at least now she could do whatever was necessary. She forced herself to think. Closing her eyes, she sat back on her heels and continued to stroke his face while she considered her options. She decided to start by probing the wound to determine exactly where the bullet was and how deep it lay. She hated to use something as crude as a filleting knife, but what else was there? That was when she remembered the compact sewing kit she carried in her purse.\\n\\n She lingered for a moment, not wanting to leave him, then hurried belowdecks.\\n\\n After setting a pan of water on the stove to boil, she dumped the contents of her purse on the mattress. Her wallet, passport, a pen and her cosmetic bag tumbled out, together with the miniature sewing kit. She yanked it open and extracted the small scissors. What she really needed was tweezers.\\n\\n She had a pair, she remembered, experiencing a sense of exhilaration. Her cosmetic bag. She kept one there, or had in years past. She pulled open the zippered bag and emptied it onto the bed. A wrapped tampon, her compact, lipstick and blush bounced on the mattress and scattered among her other things. When she shook the bag, her eyebrow pencil, lip liner and something round and gold followed, along with the tweezers.\\n\\n She took the tweezers and the small scissors, and put them both in the pan of boiling water, leaving them there for several minutes to sterilize. While she waited, she rummaged through the cupboards, certain she’d seen a bottle of scotch in an earlier search.\\n\\n “Yes!” she cried in triumph when she found it.\\n\\n Tucking it under one arm, she carried the pan of boiling water in both hands and returned to Jack.\\n\\n Feeling relatively confident that no one was chasing them—it seemed unlikely, since she’d towed every boat in town—Lorraine shut off the engines. She stared in dismay at the bobbing dock and the string of boats. Actually, her lack of forethought had been a godsend. She’d inadvertently deprived their pursuers of any way to follow them. She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as she leaned over the side and untied Scotch on Water, leaving the dock and its attached boats to drift away of their own accord.\\n\\n When she’d finished, she readied Jack as much as possible and prepared herself for the coming ordeal.\\n\\n “I’m going to check to see where the bullet is,” she told him, then explained that it might be necessary to leave it inside if she couldn’t remove it easily. Again she touched his face. For whatever reason, touching him comforted her and calmed her frazzled nerves. Her mouth was dry and her throat thick with fear.\\n\\n As gently as possible, she lifted the blood-soaked towel from his left shoulder and poured a liberal dose of alcohol on the wound. Then, feeling she needed a bit of fortification herself, she took a deep swig. The scotch burned through her, but the jolt was exactly what she needed. She secured the top and set the bottle aside.\\n\\n Inhaling a shaky breath, she studied Jack’s pale expressionless face. She tried to imagine what he’d say if he could speak to her. No doubt there’d be a few curses, an insult or two—and gruff reassurance. Biting her lower lip, Lorraine prayed for guidance and a sure hand.\\n\\n The hot tweezers scalded her skin, but she forced herself to grip them tightly, afraid they might slip. She dug carefully into the open wound. Blood gushed from his shoulder the instant she did. She dabbed it away with a folded towel. As she wiped the injury clean, she noted once more how raw and red the torn flesh looked. If he lived through this—and he would!—Jack was going to have an ugly scar.\\n\\n The tweezers scraped against the bullet, and just as she’d feared, it was buried deep in the flesh. Blood flowed more rapidly from the wound as soon as she pulled the tweezers away. Sweat beaded her brow. It soon became apparent that any attempt to extract the bullet would do more harm than good. He’d already lost a lot of blood.\\n\\n “It’s going to be all right, Jack. I’m going to leave the bullet and pack the wound with a tampon because that’s the best I have in the way of medical supplies. I’m not going to let you die. Understand?”\\n\\n Unexpectedly Jack moaned and rolled his head to one side. It seemed that, even unconscious, the man was going to argue with her.\\n\\n “Don’t worry, you won’t get PMS.” Her laugh was mildly hysterical. He’d never know what she’d done, and that was just as well or she wouldn’t hear the end of it. From now on, she’d need to boil gauze and pack the wound with it until healing had begun.\\n\\n She discarded the tweezers and scissors, returned belowdecks and retrieved the tampon. By the time she’d finished bandaging him, knotting the gauze as tightly as she could, reaction had set in and her hands trembled fiercely. She stroked his brow and pushed back his hair. His skin no longer seemed as clammy, she thought, assessing his condition in as detached a manner as she could. His respiration was better, too, not as shallow.\\n\\n It was then that the first drop of rain hit. Intent as she was on her task, Lorraine hadn’t noticed the darkening sky. The wind had picked up, as well. Moving Jack belowdecks would be impossible.\\n\\n A second drop hit her and then more. Many, many more.\\n\\n She had no choice but to wait out the storm here on deck and shelter Jack as best she could.\\n\\n Jack was in hell. At least, he assumed that was where he was. He felt as if he were on fire, then realized the pain was more localized. His shoulder seemed to be responsible for the greatest part of his discomfort.\\n\\n His mouth was parched, and all he could think about was a drink of cool, refreshing water. No, he had to be in hell—otherwise he wouldn’t be this thirsty.\\n\\n As if he’d spoken the request aloud, he felt something cool against his lips. But only a drop. God must have intended to torture him by granting a hint of relief. Just enough to remind him of the intensity of his thirst…\\n\\n “Drink,” a feminine voice whispered.\\n\\n Marcie? Here? Now? That was all he needed to convince him he was indeed being punished. Everything he wanted was offered, then withheld. He’d ventured into the lake of fire. His heart ached at the sound of her voice, so soft and loving.\\n\\n He felt his head being gently lifted. A glass of water was pressed to his lips. As soon as he recognized what it was, he drank greedily, gratefully. Heaven, he decided. He’d been routed toward a more angelic resting place—although he couldn’t imagine what he’d done to warrant such exalted treatment. But, hey, who was he to question an executive decision, especially one that leaned in his favor?\\n\\n Content now, Jack fell into a deep and peaceful sleep.\\n\\n In his dream he was visiting a Mexican village. He glanced around at the sun-baked adobe houses, the small church, the cantina. So far, so good.\\n\\n Then Marcie appeared. Sweet Marcie, the plumber’s wife. Marcie and her children. Marcie and Clifford, her husband.\\n\\n Jack watched her and admired what a terrific mother she was to her twins. Every once in a while, she looked in his direction and smiled. She couldn’t see him, though; he knew that. Because Jack stood apart, gazing in. He felt a deep sadness. The kind of sadness that left him in no doubt of his own failings and imperfections.\\n\\n Watching the dream-Marcie with her family, observing their love and happiness, was like seeing how his own life might have gone had he been a different sort of person. Had he made other choices through the years.\\n\\n Caught up in his regrets, Jack didn’t realize another man had joined the small party. He blinked, certain there must be some mistake. The man was Carlos. Jack called out a taunting remark, but the dream-Carlos couldn’t hear him.\\n\\n Then Carlos grabbed Marcie by the shoulder and shoved her against the wall. Jack bolted upright. “What do you think you’re doing?” he shouted.\\n\\n Knowing it wouldn’t do any good to yell since no one seemed able to hear him, Jack waited for Clifford to step in. But Clifford was nowhere to be seen. The children had disappeared, too.\\n\\n Turning his attention back to Marcie, he watched helplessly as Carlos shoved her again. Sure as anything, Carlos was going to rape her. Jack had to stop him. There wasn’t time to let her find her own way out of the scrape. There wasn’t time. Dammit, he’d told her to stay out of sight, warned her again and again.\\n\\n Fists clenched, Jack entered the fray. The other man’s head snapped back with the first punch. Jack was beginning to think he’d outmaneuvered him when a gun appeared in Carlos’s hand. Only, it wasn’t Jack he pointed the pistol at but Marcie.\\n\\n “No!” With a cry of outrage, Jack leaped in front of the other man and took the bullet. He felt its impact, the searing pain and the instant knowledge that he’d really done it this time. After all those lucky escapes, eluding death, it seemed his luck had run out. He was too late. This time he would die.\\n\\n Ah…now he understood. It was all plain to him now. His death, giving up his life so someone he loved might live, was what had secured him a place in heaven. The throbbing pain in his shoulder didn’t seem nearly as intense anymore. He’d saved Marcie….\\n\\n “Jack, oh, Jack, you’re burning up with fever.”\\n\\n He opened his eyes, expecting to find Marcie gazing down at him. Instead, it was Lorraine. He blinked, confused.\\n\\n “Where am I?” He wasn’t sure he’d said the words aloud until she answered.\\n\\n “In the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. Oh, Jack, I don’t have a clue where we are. We’re just drifting—the engines are off. I haven’t seen land in two days…. But at least it’s not raining right now.”\\n\\n Despite his determination to keep his eyes open, they slowly closed. He yearned to tell her not to worry, everything would work out, but the ability to speak had been taken away. He could rest easy now. Marcie was back with her husband and children, and Lorraine was safe, too. Safe from Carlos and safe from him. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sooner-the-better-deliverance-company-3/page-20.html","bookId":2350,"book":{"id":2350,"title":"The Sooner the Better (Deliverance Company #3)","description":"Storyline: The Sooner the Better (Deliverance Company #3) \\n Lorraine Dancy has just discovered that everything she believes about her father is a lie\u0026#151;starting with the fact that Thomas supposedly died years ago.
