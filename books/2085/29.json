I could guess he was torn between wanting to celebrate a partial victory against the goddess and wanting to know who and what the hell my apparent ally really was. He caught my eyes and I watched him decide to trust me. I watched him watching me watching him decide to trust me. It was true: I owed him. That was something else I\u0027d have to figure out later.\\n\\n \"Can I give you a ride home, Sunshine?\" he said casually.\\n\\n \"That would be great,\" I said feelingly. Even supposing I had bus fare in my pocket, which I didn\u0027t, I didn\u0027t yearn for the experience of getting Con and me anywhere in public. Any sane bus driver would refuse to let us on board, the way we looked, not to mention the nearest stop was a mile and a half from Yolande\u0027s and I didn\u0027t think I could walk that far.\\n\\n I doubted that any nowheresville way was available in - from - daylight. And if I was too tired to walk from the bus stop I was way beyond too tired to deal with any nowheresvilles.\\n\\n And turning up at Charlie\u0027s, looking like this and with Con in tow, wasn\u0027t an option.\\n\\n \"John, you want to take Mr. Connor - \"\\n\\n \"He can come with me,\" I said firmly. \"We have to - talk.\"\\n\\n \"I bet you do,\" said Pat. \"Okay, Sunshine, I won\u0027t ask, but take notes, okay? I\u0027m not going to do my heavy SOF guy trick and make you do your talking here because you\u0027ve already had that from the goddess, and besides, if she found out I\u0027d taken you to my office and got more out of you than she did she\u0027d bust my ass back to Tinker Bell patrol.\"\\n\\n There is a legion of little old ladies (of assorted ages and sexes) who manage to believe that the Others are mostly small and cute and harmless, and live under toadstools, and wear harebells as hats. A lot of them ring up their local SOF div to report sightings, because that is the citizenly thing to do, and since there are a few ill-tempered Others who sometimes pretend to be small and cute and harmless - I\u0027d never heard of any of them wearing harebells, however - these have to be checked out. But it is not a popular job.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been getting reports from No Town right along, you know,\" continued Pat, \"and I want to know what you guys did. And I want it in triplicate, you got that? But I\u0027m a patient man and I\u0027ll wait. I won\u0027t even tell the goddess I took you home together.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s lost his house keys anyway,\" I said glibly, \"and we can call a locksmith from my house.\"\\n\\n \"He keep a fresh change of clothes at your house too?\" said Pat. \"Does Mel know? I didn\u0027t say that.\"\\n\\n No windows yet. The other SOFs went their own ways, and it was just Pat and Con and me. Down a few more corridors, and now we were walking toward the glass doors into the parking lot. Con unobtrusively moved near me again and I tucked my arm under his arm and pretended to lean against him. It didn\u0027t take a lot of pretending, any more than my tears for the goddess had.\\n\\n Pat\u0027s glance flicked over us again and I realized he was having to make an effort not to go all, well, male. He wanted badly to try to put Con in his place and thus find out what his place was. He wanted this as a pretty high-ranking SOF officer, he wanted this as my friend and self-designated semiprotector and semiexploiter, and he probably even wanted this for Mel, who he was at least sure was genuinely human, although ordinarily he would consider my private life strictly my own business. And he\u0027d be having mixed feelings about suspecting Con as some kind of freaky partblood for the obvious reasons. But I recognized the signs in this (comparatively) respectable middle-aged SOF agent from the staring and grunting contests we got occasionally at Charlie\u0027s, and from some of the biker bars I\u0027d been to with Mel. I had a sudden frivolous desire to laugh...as we walked through the swinging doors and out into the morning.\\n\\n The sun was still low but the sunshine on my face felt like the best thing that had ever happened to me. I couldn\u0027t help it: I stopped, and raised my face to it. Con stopped with me of course. \"Sunshine for Sunshine,\" Pat said mildly. \"I\u0027ll get the car,\" and he went on, running his hands over his head as if smoothing down feathers from his frustrated dominance display. I hadn\u0027t picked up any response from Con - I could always feel Mel not responding - but then Con didn\u0027t noticeably respond to much of anything. And it wasn\u0027t that vampires didn\u0027t have their own shoving competitions - we had, after all, just survived a particularly extravagant one of these. I didn\u0027t feel like laughing any more.\\n\\n I put Con\u0027s arm around my waist so I could raise both hands to the sun, as if an extra twenty inches of extended arm was going to make a big difference to its curative properties. I didn\u0027t care. I held them, palm up, till I saw Pat\u0027s car coming toward us, and Con handed me carefully into the back seat, and slid in after me.\\n\\n I curled up and pretended to go to sleep on Con\u0027s shoulder so we didn\u0027t have to make conversation and Pat wouldn\u0027t try. This really was pretense: I couldn\u0027t go to sleep, at least not yet, and was afraid to try. Even keeping my eyes closed was an effort, but I listened intently to all the normal noises of morning in the city, smelled gas fumes and early coffee bars, and felt Con\u0027s arm around me - and his spiky hair occasionally brushing my face - and managed to keep the sights of the night before from replaying themselves against my eyelids. The smell of coffee - penetrating even through the smell of us - reminded me of Charlie\u0027s, and there was one of those weird bits of mental slippage that trauma produces: I thought, oh, what a good thing I\u0027m not dead, I never did write that recipe down for Paulie...\\n\\n It felt like a long drive, although it wasn\u0027t, still well before rush hour, and in a real car instead of the Wreck. \"Check in as soon as you can,\" was all Pat said when he dropped us off.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Con.\\n\\n Again that flick of gaze to one, then the other of us. \"Yeah,\" said Pat, and drove away.\\n\\n I had avoided losing my house key by not taking it with me. I fished it out from under the pot of pansies and the crack in the porch floor and opened the door, half-watching my hands still, as if they might turn on me and try to tear my own heart out. Con followed me up the dark stairs. My apartment was full of roses. I\u0027d forgotten about the roses. None of them was more than half open. It felt like some kind of miracle: it felt like centuries since I\u0027d bought them, two days ago. I was supposed to be dead. I would be going to work tomorrow. Cinnamon rolls. Roses. They were from another world. The human world. I glanced at my hands again. Hands that earned their living making human food. There isn\u0027t much that is a lot more nakedly hands-on than kneading dough.\\n\\n The ward wrapped around the length of the balcony railing had a big charred hole in the middle of it. When we\u0027d walked through it last night, into Other-space, presumably. The poor thing: it had probably felt like a garage mechanic presented with a lame elephant: wait just a sec here, I never said I did all forms of transport. It had been a good ward, and it had survived my smoke-borne passage on my way to find Con. I\u0027d find out later if it could be patched up or if it was blown (or squashed) for good.\\n\\n I left Con in the middle of the shadowy floor and went out into the daylight again, holding my hands out in front of me like sacrifices or discards. Con moved forward till he was standing at the edge of the shadow. \"There is nothing wrong with your hands,\" he said.\\n\\n I shook my head, but I lowered my hands till they rested on the balcony railing. There were scorch marks on the railing. On their backs, with the fingers curled up, my hands looked dead.\\n\\n \"Tell me,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I had to - touch him,\" I said in a low voice. \"I tried not to, but he was too strong. He was winning. I put my hands...I touched him. Bo.\" As I said it all the other things I was trying not to remember about the night before came racing back, bludgeoning their way into my mind. I felt myself begin to fragment again. When I\u0027d been facing the goddess, I\u0027d known what I was doing for a little while. Now that there was no immediate threat to organize myself around...I shivered, even in the daylight. Thin, cool, autumn sunlight, with winter to come, with its shorter, colder days, before the baking heat of summer returned. Autumn daylight wasn\u0027t going to heal my hands.\\n\\n Or the reopened wound on my breast. I hadn\u0027t had to look at it yet, accept its reappearance yet, while all of me was covered with crusted blood.\\n\\n \"Sunshine,\" said Con gently. \"He had no power to hurt you physically. He had had no such power for many years. His strength was in his will, and in the physical strength of those he controlled by his will. If his creatures - his acolytes - had not hurt you, he could not.\"\\n\\n I wanted to say, he did hurt me - his creatures did hurt me - they taught me what I could do. I would never have done what I did to Bo, if I had not already done it to his followers. \"He almost killed me!\" I said at last, aloud, feebly. This was an unendurably anticlimactic way of describing what had happened. Merely dying seemed like a minor difficulty, like an alarm clock that had failed to go off or a car that wouldn\u0027t start. Maybe I had been hanging out with vampires too much.\\n\\n \"Yes. By sheer force of evil. Only that.\"\\n\\n \"Only that,\" I said. \"Only that.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n I turned my head to look at him, leaving my hands awkwardly where they were. The Mr. Connor of the goddess\u0027 office had gone; my Con was back. There was a vampire in the room. He looked tired, almost as a human might look tired, as well as ragged and filthy. My vampire looked tired. I took my hands off the railing so I could go back into the shadows to Con. I reached out to touch him, twisted my hands away from him at the last moment. But he took my hands by the wrists, and kissed the back of each fist, turned them over and waited, patiently, till the fingers relaxed, and kissed each palm. It was a strange sensation. It felt less like being kissed than it felt like a doctor applying a salve. Or a priest last rites. \"There is nothing wrong with your hands,\" he said. \"The touch of evil poisons by the idea of it. Reject the idea and you have rejected the evil.\"\\n\\n I was being lectured in morality by a vampire. I wanted to laugh. The problem was that he was wrong. If he\u0027d been right maybe I could have laughed. \"My hands feel - they\u0027ve been - changed. I can feel this. They - they don\u0027t belong to me any more. They are only - attached. They feel as if they may be - have become - evil.\"\\n\\n \"Bo\u0027s evil was a very powerful idea.\"\\n\\n \"I thought I was coming to pieces. I am not sure I\u0027m not. My hands - my hands are two fragments of what is left of me.\" Two ruined fragments.\\n\\n There was a pause. \"Yes,\" said Con.\\n\\n \"How do you know?\" I whispered.\\n\\n I waited for him to drop my hands, to move away from me. The pleading whine of my voice set my own teeth on edge. He was only still with me because the sun trapped him here till sunset.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t move away. He said, \"I see it in your eyes.\"\\n\\n This was so unexpected I gaped at him. \"What - \"\\n\\n \"No. I cannot read your secrets. But I can read your fears. My kind are adept at reading fear. And you look into my eyes as no other human ever has.\"\\n\\n I looked away from him. War and Peace, my fears. All fifty-odd volumes of the Blood Lore series. The complete globenet directory. For sheer length and inclusiveness my fears were right up there. I hoped he was a speed reader.\\n\\n He dropped my hands then, but only to put a finger under my chin. \"Look at me.\"\\n\\n I let him raise my chin. Hey, he was a vampire. He could break my neck if he wanted to. This way he didn\u0027t have to.\\n\\n \"You are not afraid of everything,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Nearly,\" I said. \"I am afraid of you. I am afraid of me.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said.\\n\\n There was a curious comfort in that \"yes.\" I had definitely been hanging out with vampires too long. This vampire.\\n\\n I remembered standing in the sunlight in my kitchen window, the morning after my return from the lake. That moment when I first began to feel I might recover, from whatever it was that had happened.\\n\\n The splinters that my peace of mind had been smashed into - if not, perhaps, after all, my sanity - were sending little scouting filaments across the gaps, looking for other pieces, whether I\u0027d sent them out to look or not. Where the scout-filaments met, they\u0027d start winding themselves together again, knitting themselves back into rows...They were probably building on those first granny knots from when I\u0027d agreed to be let out of the SOF bind and be responsible for my behavior.\\n\\n No: from the first granny knots of the morning after Con had brought me home from the lake.\\n\\n I was going to have some more scars and the texture of the final weave was going to change. Was changing. It was going to be lumpier, and there were going to be some pretty weird holes. I never had been able to learn to knit. I don\u0027t do uniformity and consistency. Even my cinnamon rolls tend to have individual personality. I could probably cope with a few more wodgy bits in my own makeup.\\n\\n Maybe my medulla oblongata was refusing to take any crap from my cerebrum again. Shut up and get on with the reconstruction. If you can\u0027t find the right piece, use the wrong one.\\n\\n I took a step backward, still facing Con, still within reach of him, but so that the sunlight touched me.\\n\\n There was something struggling out of the murk here, trying to make me think it: If good is going to triumph over evil, good has to stay sane.\\n\\n Say what? Oh, please. I\u0027m still thinking about breathing. Now I\u0027m supposed to start in flogging myself to go on fighting for the forces of...well, \"good\" is some freaking mouthful. It sounds like some Anglo-Saxon geek with a big square jaw and a blazing sword, any vestigial sense of humor surgically removed years before when he was conditionally accepted to Hero School.\\n\\n But that was kind of where I\u0027d wound up, even if I\u0027d missed out on the jaw and the training. Because I was definitely against evil. Definitely. In my lumpy, erratic way. And I knew what I was talking about, because I\u0027d now met evil. That was precisely the point.\\n\\n I\u0027d touched it.\\n\\n And I was going to have to remember for the rest of my life that I\u0027d touched it. That these hands had grasped, pulled...\\n\\n But us anti-evil guys have to stay sane. Lumpy and holey, maybe, but sane. Listen, Sunshine: Bo was gone. He wasn\u0027t going to get the last word now.\\n\\n I hoped.\\n\\n At least not until later this morning.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to run a bath. I\u0027ll flip you for who goes first.\" I had a jar on my desk, next to the balcony, that held loose change.\\n\\n \"Flip?\" Vampires. They don\u0027t know anything.\\n\\n I won. I was almost sorry. I felt obliged to have only one bath, and a fast one, but I made it count. If I rubbed my palms a little rawer than I needed to for an idea, at least my hands felt like my hands while I was doing it. Perhaps the touch of the rose petals, when I\u0027d had to move all the floating roses out of the bath so I could get me into it instead, had helped.\\n\\n There was no wound on my breast. I hadn\u0027t believed it at first. I kept rubbing the soap all over my front, from throat to pubic line, as if maybe I\u0027d mislaid it somehow. But it wasn\u0027t there. The scar was. I thought it looked a little...wider, shinier, than it had, the day after Con had closed it the first time. But it was a scar.\\n\\n But my chain was gone too, and there was a new scar, which dipped over the old one, in the shape of a chain hanging around my neck. Together they looked like some new rune, but I couldn\u0027t read it.\\n\\n There was no sign of the golden web, no matter how hard I scrubbed.\\n\\n ...What had I been saying about going on fighting for the forces of good? In that mad little moment right after Con had said something comforting? That a vampire had seemed to say something comforting should have told me I was having a crazy moment, not a returning-sanity-and-hope moment.\\n\\n Going on doing anything like what I\u0027d been doing these last five months - horribly culminating in what I had done last night - was approximately the last thing I wanted.\\n\\n Especially when it meant bearing the knowledge of what I\u0027d done. And that going on doing it would mean bearing more of doing and more of knowing.\\n\\n But Pat had said we had less than a hundred years left. Us humans. No, not us humans. Us-on-the-right-side. And there aren\u0027t enough of us.\\n\\n Okay, here\u0027s the irony: if I went on with this heavy magic-handling shtick I was likely to be around in a hundred years.\\n\\n I pulled the plug and started toweling myself dry. I rubbed violently at my hair like I was trying to friction-burn undesirable thoughts out of my head. I washed and dried my little knife tenderly, however, and put it back in my fresh, clean, dry pocket. I was dressed in the first thing out of the top cupboard in the bathroom, where all my oldest, rattiest clothes lived. Then I started another bath and called Con.\\n\\n I found a one-size-fits-all kimono in the back of my closet that Con could get into, or rather that would go round him; at least it was black. I could give him the shirt in the back of my closet but it wouldn\u0027t be long enough on him.\\n\\n Right. I was clean. Con had something to wear. On to the next thing. Food. I didn\u0027t have to think any more long-view thoughts yet. I still had small immediate things to organize myself around.\\n\\n I was frying eggs when he came out, looking very exotic in the kimono. I stood there holding a skillet with three beautifully fried eggs in it and said miserably, \"I can\u0027t even feed you.\" How I\u0027d organized my entire life: feeding other people. I heard what I was saying - or what I was saying it to - a moment after the words came out, but his gaze did not waver.\\n\\n \"I do not eat often. I do not need food.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. I\u0027d narrowly avoided mental breakdown as a result of facing ancient all-consuming evil, and now I was about to lose it over giving a vampire breakfast. I felt tears pricking at my eyes. This was ridiculous. \"I can\u0027t eat in front of you. It\u0027s so...I feed people for a living. If I don\u0027t do it I\u0027m a failure. I identify as a feeder of...\"\\n\\n \"People,\" said Con. \"I am not a person.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d just been having this conversation with myself in the bathroom. \"Yes you are,\" I said. \"You\u0027re just not, you know, human.\"\\n\\n \"Your food grows cold,\" said Con. \"It is better hot, yes?\"\\n\\n I shook my head mutinously. He was right, though, it was a pity to ruin such ravishing eggs.\\n\\n \"I will drink with you,\" said Con.\\n\\n \"Orange juice?\" I said hopefully. It had to have calories in it. Water didn\u0027t count.\\n\\n \"Very well. Orange juice.\"\\n\\n I moved three white roses out of one of my nice glasses, gave it a quick wash, and poured orange juice in it. It was one of the tall ones with gold flecks. Silly thing to drink juice out of. I didn\u0027t see him drink - it occurred to me I hadn\u0027t seen him drink his tea in the goddess\u0027 office either - but nearly half a gallon of orange juice disappeared while I ate my eggs and two toasted muffins and a scone. (What a good thing that it hadn\u0027t occurred to me to empty my refrigerator before I died.) Did that mean he liked it, or was this his demanding standard of courtesy again?\\n\\n \"What does it taste like?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"It tastes like orange juice,\" he said, at his most enigmatic.\\n\\n How was I planning on putting us-on-the-right-side, anyway? Con had been on the right side as compared to Bo. Con was still a vampire. He still...\\n\\n I did the dishes in silence while Con sat in his chair. The kimono made him look very zen, sitting still doing nothing. I\u0027d seen it first at the lake, that capacity for sitting still doing nothing with perfect grace: although that wasn\u0027t how I\u0027d thought of it when we were chained to the wall together. And it was interesting that he retained it when he wasn\u0027t under the prospect of immediate elimination with no way out, which might be expected to focus the mind. If it didn\u0027t blow it to smithereens.\\n\\n I did the dishes slowly. We\u0027d done washing and eating. There wasn\u0027t anything to come except to figure out sleeping arrangements. Con had acknowledged that vampires did something like sleep during the day. And my body had to have sleep soon or I was going to fall down where I stood. But my mind couldn\u0027t deal with it. I\u0027d tried to convince myself to haul some laundry downstairs but I couldn\u0027t face the effort: stairs: the assault on Everest, and where were my Sherpas? I rescued Con\u0027s trousers from where he had rinsed and wrung them out and draped them over the towel rack (you don\u0027t think of vampires in domestic-chore terms, but I suppose even vampires have to come to some arrangement about getting their clothes washed), and hung them on the balcony for the sun and wind to dry them; at least they were still trousers, if a trifle ravaged by events, which was more than could be said for the remains of his shirt. I scuffled around in my closet again - at some peril to life and limb, since my com gear tended increasingly to get left in there - and pulled the spare shirt out, and left it on the closet doorknob.\\n\\n Every utensil was scoured within an inch of its life and dried and put away too soon.\\n\\n Sleep. No way.\\n\\n At least, being this tired, and still half-watching my hands for renegade moves, I wasn\u0027t interested in - or maybe I should say I wasn\u0027t capable of brooding about - what else might happen in a bed-type situation. Or could happen. Or wasn\u0027t going to happen.\\n\\n I was capable of brooding about being afraid to be alone. Afraid to sleep.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have to have the bed,\" I said. \"There are no curtains for the balcony, and the sun gets pretty much all round the living room over the course of the day. I\u0027ll sleep on the sofa.\"\\n\\n He was silent for a moment, and I thought he might argue. I\u0027m not sure I wasn\u0027t waiting hopefully for an argument. But all he said finally was, \"Very well.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sunshine/page-29.html","bookId":2085,"book":{"id":2085,"title":"Sunshine","description":"Storyline: The story is set in an alternate universe, taking place after the “Voodoo Wars”, a conflict between humans and the “Others”.
