{"id":89298,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"So I glanced through my cosmail to make sure I wasn\u0027t missing anything important. The usual globenet come-ons: a ride on the space bus for only a hundred squillion blinks and the soul of your firstborn child. A plastic surgeon who guaranteed to make you look like Princess Helga or your money back. And your face back too? I wondered. Learn spellcasting at home in your spare time, earn zillions, and live forever. I\u0027d always assumed the living forever was out of the same scam as the earning zillions. I wondered how old Yolande was - how old her master was. I doubted it was four hundred years. I answered a few cosmails. My presence in various Other zones had faded in the last five months. I could have given definite answers to some of the pet topics (Has a human, once captured, ever escaped from a vampire? Have a human and a vampire ever had a conversation on any kind of equal terms? Have a human and a vampire ever had any conversation and parted with the human still alive? - Barring some of the media stuff, although another pet topic was whether any of the vampire interviews were real). I had no desire to do so. But it had only been since my first contact with Other-space that it had occurred to me perhaps it would be a good idea to continue to pretend that Cinnamon - my ether name for seven years - was an ordinary woman who hadn\u0027t had anything surprising happen to her lately. When I came out of the closet it was barely twilight. I thought sunset was never coming. This might be the first day of my life I\u0027d ever wanted darkness to come sooner. I always wanted daylight to last longer. I had a lot more trouble getting up at four a.m. in winter when it was still going to be dark for hours than in summer when it would be glimmering toward dawn by the time I got to Charlie\u0027s. I took a cup of chamomile tea out on the balcony and waited, feeling the darkness falling as if it were something landing on my skin. I heard him coming this time. I don\u0027t know why I thought of it as hearing, when it had nothing to do with my ears. I didn\u0027t see any shadows moving among the other shadows of the garden either, although I knew he was there. But it was more like hearing than it was like anything else, like seeing in the dark is more like seeing than it is like anything else. \"The way here has grown in complexity,\" he said. \"Oh - ah?\" I said. \"Oh. That will be Yolande\u0027s new wards. SOF has set up some tickers and I don\u0027t know what all.\" \"Tickers,\" said Con. \"You know,\" I said. \"You must know. SOF uses them - they record any Others that come near them. Tick tick, back at HQ where they\u0027re watching the monitors.\" \"I have not had much contact with SOF.\" The Lone Ranger of vampires. Did that make me Tonto? \"Whatever. The point is SOF thinks they\u0027re protecting me. So I asked Yolande to disarm any SOF snoopers that would notice you.\" \"Yolande.\" \"My landlady.\" \"You have told her about me?\" I snorted. \"She told me. Turns out she\u0027s known all along. And she\u0027s a wardskeeper. She\u0027s real useful to have on your side.\" Con was silent. I felt sympathetic. I wouldn\u0027t have liked the idea that he\u0027d brought a friend into our business either. I was so keyed up that I didn\u0027t think about our disastrous last meeting till I\u0027d already taken his hand, and then it was too late. He came back from wherever he\u0027d been, presumably thinking about having another human foisted on him, and looked at me. His fingers curled around mine. I had a Senssurround Dolby flash of The Ten Seconds That Didn\u0027t Go Anywhere, but I hit the mental censor button and it went poof. \"Listen,\" I said, although it was even less like listening than the nonsound of him moving toward me had been like listening. It was strangely easier too, doing it with him, showing him my new road map rather than trying to figure it out myself. He knew the language and the landscape. I had a great idea: next time Pat called me in to SOF for a little more technical mayhem, I\u0027d bring Con. \"Hi, I\u0027d like you to meet my helpful vampire friend. Don\u0027t worry, my landlady is a retired - mostly retired - wardskeeper, and she says he\u0027s okay.\" Sure. Speaking of having more humans foisted. Pat would take some foisting. But I stared into Con\u0027s green eyes, and aligned myself, or him, like you might take someone\u0027s shoulders and turn them round so they\u0027re facing the right direction, like you might point at a map once you\u0027ve told your companion, see, it\u0027s those mountains you see right over there... For a very nasty moment I thought I\u0027d somehow managed to remake the live contact. That we weren\u0027t looking at a map of those mountains, but had been transported there, and the tigers were closing in. I jerked back, but Con\u0027s hand held me, and the jerk was like the click-over of the kaleidoscope, and the colored bits fell into a new arrangement. It was weirdly something like looking through an aquarium at a lot of fish. The fish were whizzing around like crazy - cannonball fish - but I could see them individually, a little, and they did look like distinct and specific little whizzings-around instead of like chaos. This was interesting, although it didn\u0027t really get me any farther; they were still moving too fast for me to track a pattern or make my way among them. But this wasn\u0027t as sick-making - or as terrifying - to watch or to think about. Presumably this was a good thing. But I remembered the quality of the terror, and wasn\u0027t sure that not being terrified was wise or sane. What we were looking for was behind the whizzing things. And that was still just as sick-making, just as terrifying. I didn\u0027t like this animated three-dimensional map. Here be dragons. Much worse than any dragon, which are pretty straightforward - and straightforwardly alive - creatures that merely suffer that little character defect about liking to eat human flesh. Here be horrors indescribable. I barely sensed the dreadful loom of it - the differentiation of it from its manic pinball machine guard system - before I was repelled, repulsed, hurled away more violently than Con had thrown me the other night...except it was Con, this time, who caught me. I was flopped against him, his arm round my waist, my ear pressed to his silent chest. I grabbed at his other arm, steadied myself, balanced again on my own feet, which seemed very small and very far away. \"Have I given us away? Con, was that live?\" The world still spun. If there had been anything in my stomach but tea (the muffins were a long time ago) it might have come up. As it was, the tea sloshed vindictively a few times and subsided. The chain burned round my throat. \"No,\" said Con. \"My Sunshine, you must learn moderation. This is not an enemy you can defeat by rushing his front gate.\" I made a little choking noise that might have been third cousin twice removed to a laugh. \"I had no intention of anything resembling gate-crashing. I thought I was just looking. Except it wasn\u0027t, um, looking.\" \"No,\" said Con. I could feel him thinking. \"If you were a new - one of us - there are things I could teach you. I do not think I can teach a human these things.\" I sighed. \"I believe you. Like seeing in the dark probably doesn\u0027t bother you because you don\u0027t spend a lot of time seeing in the light, right?\" \"I am sorry.\" As partners we left a lot to be desired. \"Was that him?\" Con\u0027s eyes blazed briefly. Vampire eyes catching sight of their chosen prey. Don\u0027t look. \"Yes.\" \"Can you - can you track him any better from what I - sort of - showed you?\" Con\u0027s face arranged itself in one of its invisible-to-the-naked-human-eye almost-expressions. I guessed this one was irony. Note: existence of vampire irony. \"I am not sure. It is certainly a signal we want to take heed of. How we take heed without jeopardizing ourselves unnecessarily I do not yet know. Remember that was not live, as you put it. It was only your memory - your exegesis - of what you saw.\" I shivered. \"I believe you were in less danger, even last night, than you may fear. What this is is a little like...what are those machines with the strange radiance, which attract insects to their deaths?\" \"Zappers? Bug zappers. Bug flies in - zap.\" \"You were zapped. The machine does not register the - bug. It merely zaps. I use these zappers also.\" \"Vampires don\u0027t use bug zappers?\" I said, interested. There\u0027s nothing like an immediate death threat to make you crave a little superficial distraction. I\u0027d observed this phenomenon before. \"All that hanging around out of doors after dark you guys do?\" \"No.\" \"Wrong kind of blood?\" \"Vampires do not - er - register on insect radar.\" \"Oh.\" At last: a really good reason to want to be a vampire. I was one of those people you invite on your picnic or your hiking expedition, because the bugs will all crowd around me and leave everyone else alone. Sunshine, get a grip. \"Um. This isn\u0027t the first time I\u0027ve been...well, let me tell you the rest of it.\" I did. \"So last night was the third time and the worst. You don\u0027t think he might be using a sort of fancy zapper that says, \u0027Hey, boss, this bug keeps coming back\u0027?\" \"I think I will ask you not to go near that place again for the time being. Even if this Pat asks you to try.\" \"It\u0027s not Pat I\u0027m so worried about,\" I said. \"It\u0027s the goddess of pain.\" \"Ah.\" His expressionlessness took an ominous cast. \"Con,\" I said nervously. His gaze came back from wherever it had been and he looked at me. \"No,\" he said. I didn\u0027t ask what \"no\" meant. Vampires are a little like burglars, okay? If a bright, determined vampire really wants to get into your house, he\u0027s going to do it, and the best alarm system in the world and the electric moat and the sixteen genetically enhanced Rottweilers and the wards and the charms and the little household godlets blessed by the priests or pontifexes of the religion of your choice, and spellcast by the best sorcerers money can buy, aren\u0027t going to stop him. Or her. You really don\u0027t want to piss a vampire off, because it\u0027s a lot harder having all that plastic surgery and the hemo treatment to change your blood chemistry than it is to sell your house and go live in a small cabin with nothing in it to steal. Also, the hemo treatment not only costs a bomb, occasionally it kills you, although at least two of the global council members have had it done twice that anybody knows about, and are still here. The usual, which is to say, expensive, drastic options aren\u0027t available to coffeehouse bakers. Having realized that my being alive geared Bo up, Con wasn\u0027t my best choice, he was my only choice. But the problem with having a nonhuman as your ally was that a nonhuman might not be, you know, very sentimental about the odd human life here and there. Especially not a vampire nonhuman about a human who shows signs of reading the mind of the vampire\u0027s human ally. And fair is fair. I wasn\u0027t very sentimental about vampires as a group either, was I? \"I can say no to the goddess if I have to,\" I said, perhaps a little more loudly than necessary. \"I am certain you can, Sunshine,\" said Con. He was gone a moment later. I didn\u0027t exactly see him go, but I didn\u0027t-hear him moving away from me, and didn\u0027t-see the shadow among the other shadows, after he was gone. I didn\u0027t pay a lot of attention, however, because I was preoccupied with the feeling on my mouth, as if he had kissed me before he left. More horrible grisly marking time, wondering what was going on. Wondering what is going on behind my back, wondering what is about to leap out of the shadows at me. At my worst I could begin wondering if I\u0027d imagined Con. Well, he was the part that didn\u0027t fit the pattern, wasn\u0027t he? Nice, helpful, if somewhat unreassuring-looking, vampire. Puhleez. There was enough to remind me there was something going on - starting with the scar on my breast and moving through seeing in the dark and the spontaneous combustion of pillows and ending, perhaps with the fact that there didn\u0027t ever not seem to be some SOF or other at Charlie\u0027s now, and that any time I walked in or out of the door whoever-it-was\u0027s eyes fixed themselves on me. For a while I\u0027d made a point of coming in by the side door any time the coffeehouse was open, but I decided this was making a bigger issue of something I couldn\u0027t do anything about, so on days I was feeling hardy I went through the front. Let \u0027em stare. It had taken Aimil\u0027s remark to make me notice that Mrs. Bialosky was occupying her table more than usual. But she\u0027d nominated herself as one of my protectors in one very practical way: some mangled version of recent events meant that we still had gapers coming in to check out if I had three heads or spoke in tongues. They didn\u0027t stay long if Mrs. Bialosky rumbled them. Which kindly took the onus off our staff, which if they weren\u0027t getting as tired of my notoriety as I was, had every right to. But it was all too much, and my overworked and exhausted brain started looking for things to call imaginary. Con was such a perfect choice. I sometimes felt if I could get rid of Con I could be rid of all the rest of it - Bo, my heritage and weird talents, SOF\u0027s suffocating interest, the lot. I knew it wasn\u0027t true. But... I did have one nice surprise. One afternoon I came out of the bakery and discovered someone unfamiliar sitting at Mrs. Bialosky\u0027s table, and with whom Mrs. B was in deep conversation. I couldn\u0027t resist this, so I slid along behind the counter to get a look without walking up to the table and staring: not that my subterfuge worked, because Mrs. B immediately raised her head and looked back at me. But this made the other person turn to look at what Mrs. B was looking at. She broke into a smile when she saw me: it was Maud. I hadn\u0027t registered till then that there was a large plate on the table between them that presently contained a light sprinkling of crumbs and one single remaining Killer Zebra. One of these mornings at four-thirty a.m. I was expecting to find a SOF lurking on a street corner too, and the fact that I didn\u0027t see one didn\u0027t convince me there wasn\u0027t one there somewhere. Pat had made an official offer to have me escorted to and from home, which I didn\u0027t let him finish before I refused. Other than that I hadn\u0027t seen much of him: damage control with the goddess, I assumed. I was interested myself that my desire for autonomy was still stronger than my fear of what might or was about to happen. My unfavoritest corner, when I arrived at Charlie\u0027s before dawn, wasn\u0027t the nearest one, where Mandelbaum met the main road, but across the square, at the mouth of one of the littlest and darkest alleys of Old Town. I pretended to fish for my keys and then made a big pantomime fuss about choosing the right one every morning as I scanned for shadows that didn\u0027t lie right. Shadows never lay right in that corner. I always felt watched, these days. It was just a question of watched by whom. Or what. After I opened the door and went in, I relocked the door behind me before I turned off the alarm system. Used to be I didn\u0027t bother to relock the door. I\u0027d asked Charlie to program an extra few seconds\u0027 delay to the bell so I could. He\u0027d looked at me worriedly, but he\u0027d done it. And he hadn\u0027t asked any questions. He wasn\u0027t going to say the \"v\" word if I wasn\u0027t. We don\u0027t have a state-of-the-art alarm system at Charlie\u0027s - we can\u0027t afford it - but this is one of the ways having SOF friends is useful, and we do have some funny little gizmos that tell you if anything has been disturbed. Nothing went on being disturbed, except my mental state. I was pulling maple cornbread out of the ovens at about eight one morning when Mary came in to say Theo wanted a word. I thought about it. \"Okay,\" I said. \"Time I had a break, I guess.\" Theo sidled in like the reluctant bearer of unwelcome news. My private bakery kettle was beginning to hiss and burble. \"Tea?\" He shook his head. \"Cornbread?\" He brightened immediately. I was as bad as Paulie, really, despite how long I\u0027d been doing this. Someone wants to eat my food, they\u0027re automatically my friend. Someone who doesn\u0027t want to eat my food, they automatically aren\u0027t. This is an awkward attitude if you hang out a lot with a vampire. Theo was an old enough hand in the kitchen - my kitchen anyway - to know to approach something fresh out of the oven with caution. He took the whacked-off still-squodgy-with-baking end of a loaf of maple cornbread gingerly and watched happily as the approximately quarter-pound of butter he put on it melted through. He would lick the plate when he was done. This was one of the advantages of eating out back: table manners weren\u0027t required. I\u0027d been known to lick plates myself. Once when I was teasing Kyoko about him, I mentioned he was a plate-licker. She looked briefly interested \"Oh? Maybe he\u0027s human after all.\" Then she shook her head. \"Nah. He\u0027s SOF.\" This was in hindsight a better joke than I\u0027d realized. \"You\u0027d better get it over with,\" I said, after he\u0027d finished licking the plate. He sighed. \"Pat would like to see you this afternoon.\" I\u0027d decided in the predawn darkness of the morning after I\u0027d met the goddess what I was going to say the next time Pat wanted to talk to me. \"It won\u0027t do him any good. Something burned out the other night. I burned out. I woke up the next morning with a piece missing. It\u0027s still missing.\" He looked surprised, worried, then thoughtful. Then, to my great surprise, hopeful. \"He\u0027ll still want to see you.\" \"Why are you looking so pleased?\" He hesitated. \"The goddess wants to take over. Take you over. She says it\u0027s because Pat destroyed government property, that he\u0027s bungled, that she wants to clean up the mess, that you\u0027re to be sent back where you came from after she\u0027s sure no security has been breached, that it was all glang anyway. But it\u0027s really because she\u0027s pissed off that someone may have thought of something or discovered something before she did. Something that might be important - something she might be able to use.\" \"And you think Pat\u0027ll think that merely blowing out the county HQ\u0027s com system on a bad call is better than the goddess finding out maybe it\u0027s a good call?\" \"Yeah.\" I thought of her walking-nuclear-reactor aura. \"If I wasn\u0027t afraid of the goddess already, I would be now.\" He smiled. It was a rickety sort of smile. \"You don\u0027t know half - You don\u0027t want to know half. You want my advice, you stick to suckers. When do you get off today? Pat\u0027ll come by just before.\" \"Three,\" I said. His eyes were wandering to the muffin racks. There were bran raisin and oatmeal applesauce allspice waiting to go into the cases up front. \"Have one for the road,\" I said. \"Thanks,\" he said. He took two. Pat drifted in at a few minutes to three. I now knew that it would take a lot to make him look short of sleep, and he looked short of sleep. He looked worse than short of sleep. He raised hollow eyes and said, \"Hey, Sunshine.\" \"You look like hell,\" I said. I was scraping out the last baking tin. Our Albion crowd would have to be really hungry today to get through this lot. And I\u0027d made my special cream-cheese sauce to go with the triple-ginger gingerbread. I\u0027d long felt that gingerbread, while excellent in itself, was still essentially an excuse to eat the sauce, so I\u0027d always made twice as much per portion as the original recipe called for. Then it turned out that some of our customers were even more crazed than I was, so I\u0027d started making three times as much, and we served it in little sauceboats. You got purists occasionally that didn\u0027t want any sauce, but the slack was taken up somehow. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"What\u0027s happening?\" He shrugged. His shoulder must be better. Maybe blue-demon blood made you heal fast too. \"What Theo told you.\" \"You look like you\u0027ve been let out of the dungeon. I thought thumbscrews were passe.\" \"The goddess doesn\u0027t need thumbscrews. She just looks at you and you feel your brains melting.\" I thought of the other night. \"I believe you.\" \"Theo says you\u0027ve lost it.\" \"Yeah. I\u0027m safe from the goddess. No brains left to melt.\" \"No one is ever safe from the goddess.\" The Pat I knew surfaced and he gave me a familiar look: shrewd, humorous, no nonsense. \"How lost do you suppose it is?\" I pulled off my apron and untied my hair. \"Lost enough for now. If I replace a fuse and the system starts working again, I\u0027ll let you know.\" \"Maybe you\u0027re just tired,\" said Pat. \"Maybe,\" I said amiably. Pat ran his hand through what there was of his hair. \"I don\u0027t like it when you agree with me, Sunshine. It\u0027s not your style. What aren\u0027t you telling me?\" \"That I\u0027m relieved not to have to try again,\" I said. I knew he bought it: he sagged, suddenly looking smaller and older. I felt a fierce pang of guilt, but I reminded myself that he believed that the only good vampire was a staked, beheaded, and burned vampire. Briefly and wistfully I considered a scenario where Con and I had a SOF team with us when we...whatever...but I recognized this as a fantasy, like a scenario where the goddess of pain retired from SOF and opened a day care center. \"You look like a man who needs caffeine,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll grab us something from the counter and meet you outside. Do you want privacy or comfort?\" Comfort meant the nice little tables out front, overlooking the square and Mrs. Bialosky\u0027s flower bed, still doing its stuff with chrysanthemums and asters this late in the year. \"Privacy,\" he said. He was sitting at one of the unsteady tables in the grim little courtyard behind the coffeehouse that by never doing anything with we could continue to avoid opening to customers. You got used to the roar of the kitchen fans and Mom had a couple of tough little evergreen shrubs in pots that could survive the cooking fumes. Pat and I didn\u0027t talk about anything much after all. He drank the coffee and engulfed the various buns and other edible objects I\u0027d brought, but absentmindedly, like a refueling procedure. The fact that he didn\u0027t argue with me about trying again, about trying to find out the extent of the burnout - about whether or not there really was a burnout - made me feel more guilty. Silence fell. Pat stared into nothing. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. He looked at me. \"I believe you,\" he said. He stood up. \"I\u0027m not sure I believe the rest of it, but I believe you\u0027re sorry about it.\" He paused. \"Makes my life easier in some ways.\" Another gleam of the normal Pat as he said: \"Maybe by the time you\u0027ve decided you\u0027re not burned out any more the goddess will have found someone else to crucify.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. He rubbed both hands through his hair this time, and added, \"I didn\u0027t say this. But watch your back, Sunshine.\" Then he left. Mel wandered out a few minutes after Pat had left. I was staring into my teacup. I\u0027d forgotten to bring a sieve out, so there were tea leaves in the bottom of it, but I couldn\u0027t read them. \"You look like a woman who needs a good laugh,\" he said. \"Have you heard the one about the were-pigeon and the streetcleaner?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sunshine/page-23.html","bookId":2085,"book":{"id":2085,"title":"Sunshine","description":"Storyline: The story is set in an alternate universe, taking place after the “Voodoo Wars”, a conflict between humans and the “Others”.
