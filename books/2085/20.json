{"id":89295,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Assailable. An interesting choice of adjective. I looked up at him, and he looked down at me. I couldn\u0027t see into the shadows on his face. They remained shadows. They didn\u0027t wiggle or sparkle and they didn\u0027t have red edges. They didn\u0027t go down a long way. They were just shadows. Cute. The only person who still looked normal out of my eyes wasn\u0027t a person and wasn\u0027t normal. The look between us lengthened. He might not be able to lure me to the same doom he almost had the second night at the lake, but it seemed to me it was still doom I saw in his eyes. I looked away. \"Improvements,\" I said. \"You mean some of this - this - \" The phrases that occurred to me were not tactful: this tragic reproduction of William Beckford\u0027s front parlor, or perhaps Ludwig II\u0027s. \"You mean some of this, er, stuff is, er, yours?\" \"Nothing you may see, no. I do not like tying up my strength in objects. It was an old argument with my master. Physical shape has a certain durability that the less tangible lacks, but I feel it is a brittle durability. He believed otherwise.\" And he\u0027s the one who got skegged, I thought. \"Do you know what Bo\u0027s philosophy of, er, defense is?\" Pause. Finally he said: \"He puts most of his energies into his gang. This will not help us locate him.\" I sighed. \"This is another of those vampire-senses-are-different things, isn\u0027t it?\" I supposed I had to tell him what I\u0027d found through the globenet - how I\u0027d first found the bad nowheresville, the beyond-dark human-squishing space, and what else seemed to be in there. If \"in\" was the right preposition. Out? On? Up? With? After? Over? English has too many prepositions. Did I have to mention SOF? I didn\u0027t have to tell him anything yet. He didn\u0027t seem to be in a big hurry to get me home. How close, in ordinary human-measured geography, was this earth-place to Yolande\u0027s house? Ally or no ally, I didn\u0027t like the idea of our being neighbors. \"Bo isn\u0027t his real name, is it?\" I said. \"It sounds like something you\u0027d call a sheepdog.\" \"It is short for Beauregard.\" I laughed. I hadn\u0027t known I had a laugh available. A vampire named Beauregard. It was too perfect. And he probably hadn\u0027t got it accidentally from his stepdad who ran a coffeehouse. \"How much time do we have?\" I said. \"Bo, I mean, not today\u0027s dawn.\" I was beginning to learn when he was thinking and when he was merely thinking about what to say to me, a bumptious human. This time he was thinking. \"I have been out of context since we last met,\" he said. Yes, he said context. \"I do not know. I will find out.\" \"Same time, same place,\" I murmured. \"Not.\" \"I do not understand.\" \"We have to meet again, right?\" I said. \"And I have things to tell you too. I may have a - a kind of line on Bo myself.\" He nodded. I didn\u0027t know whether to be flattered or outraged. Maybe he thought he\u0027d chosen his confederate well. Equal partners with a vampire: an exhilarating concept. Supposing you lived long enough to enjoy the buzz. But I guess \"Hey, well done, congratulations, wow\" weren\u0027t in common vampire usage. Maybe I could teach him that too, with \"probably\" and \"not before next week.\" \"I will come to you, if I may,\" he said. \"You would rather I didn\u0027t come here again.\" I hadn\u0027t meant to say that either, but it popped out. A clear trace of surprise showed on his face for about a third of a second. I wouldn\u0027t have seen it if I hadn\u0027t been looking straight at him, but it was there. \"You may come here if you wish. I...\" He stopped. I could guess what he was thinking. It was the same thing I was thinking. Wasn\u0027t thinking. \"Come. I will give you a token.\" He slid easily through the gap in the impedimenta (sorry, this household brought out the worst in my vocabulary; it was like every bad novel and hyperbolic myth I\u0027d ever read crowding round to haunt me in three dimensions) and made off into the dark. I had a sidelong peek at the overturned goblet as I passed it. My dark vision steadied if I kept it on Con\u0027s back, so I did, mostly, resisting the compelling desire to try to figure out what some of the more tortured blacknesses indicated by looking at them directly: hydras with interminable heads; Laocoon with several dozen sons and twice as many serpents; an infestations of trifflds; the entire chariot race from Ben Hur: all frozen in plaster or wood or stone. I hoped. Especially the trifflds. Con stopped at a cupboard. It had curlicues leaping out of its lid like a forest of satyrs\u0027 horns, and something - things - like satyrs themselves oiling down the edges. It was satyrs. Their hands were its handles. Ugh. Con, his own hand on one of the doors, glanced at me. \"Why did the Cup distress you?\" I shrugged. How was I going to explain? \"My question is not an idle one,\" he said. \"I do not wish to distress you.\" Not till after we\u0027d defeated Mr. Bo Jangles anyway. Oh, Sunshine, give a vampire a break. He probably thinks he\u0027s trying. \"I\u0027m not sure I can explain,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not sure I can explain to me. And vampires aren\u0027t much into family ties, are they?\" \"No,\" he said. I already knew vampires aren\u0027t great on irony. \"I...have got into this because of my inheritance on my father\u0027s side. I\u0027m certainly alive to tell about it - so far - on account of that inheritance, right? But - \" I looked into his face as I said this, and decided that the standard impassivity was at the soft, understanding end of the range, like marble is a little softer than adamant. \"I\u0027m a little twitchy about this bond thing with you, and the idea of - of - a kind of background to it - that your master had dealings with my dad\u0027s family - I don\u0027t like it.\" I didn\u0027t want to know that the monster that lived under your bed when you were a kid not only really is there but used to have a few beers with your dad. \"And the only training I\u0027ve ever had, if you want to call it training, was a few hours changing flowers into feathers and back with my gran fifteen years ago, and I feel a little...well, exposed. Unready.\" I could maybe have said, assailable. \"I see.\" Con stared at the ugly door for a moment as if making up his mind, and then opened it. Inside were rows and rows of tiny drawers. I could feel the - well, it wasn\u0027t heat, and it wasn\u0027t a smell, and it wasn\u0027t tiny voices, but it was a little like all three together. There were dozens of things in those drawers and not an inert one in the lot. They were all yelling/secreting/radiating a kind of ME! ME! ME! like the jock kids in school when the coach is choosing teams. I wondered what the cupboard was made of. I didn\u0027t feel like touching it myself and seeing if it might tell me anything. I didn\u0027t like the grins on the faces of the satyrs. Con opened a drawer and lifted out a thin chain. The other voices/emissions subsided at once, some of them with a distinct grumble (or fart). The chain glimmered in the nonlight - the foxy-colored light of the fire didn\u0027t reach this far - it looked like opal, if there was a way to make flexible connecting loops out of opal. It was humming a kind of thin fey almost-tune; my mind, or my ear, kept trying to turn it into a melody, but it wouldn\u0027t quite go. Con poured it from one palm to the other - it looked fine as cobweb in his big hands - and then held it up again, spreading his fingers so that it hung in a near-circle. The almost-tune began to change. It would catch, like a tiny flaw tripping a recording, making it hesitate and skip; but each time it picked up again the tune had changed. It did this over and over as I listened, as Con held it up; and as I listened the strange, wavering nontune seemed to grow increasingly familiar, as if it were a noise like the purr of a refrigerator or the high faint whine of a TV with the sound turned off. Familiar: comfortable. Safe. I also felt, eerily, that the sound was becoming more familiar because it was somehow trying to become familiar: like the shape of a stranger at the other end of the street becomes your old friend so-and-so as it gets close enough for you to see their face and possibly that ratty old coat they should have thrown out years ago. This sibylline chain was approaching me...and dressing itself up as an old friend. It knew its job. By the time it drifted off into silence I was reaching for it as if it belonged to me. Which maybe it did. Con dropped it over my hands and it seemed to stroke my skin as it slid down my fingers. I watched it gleaming for a moment - the gleam seemed to have a rhythm, like a heartbeat - and then I dropped it over my head. It disappeared under the collar of the black shirt, but I felt it lying against me, crossing the tips of the scar below my collarbones, resting in a curve over my heart. \"Thank you,\" I said, falteringly. I knew a powerful piece of magic when I saw it and hung it round my neck, but I had never heard of anything quite like this...convergence; usually you had to make a terrific effort to match things up even a quarter so well as this. Of course what I didn\u0027t know about magic handling would fill libraries. Also, \"thank you\" seemed about as pathetic a response to such a marvel as anyone could make. \"I thought it would be glad to go to you.\" \"Er - didn\u0027t you - \" \"No. My master was vexed when he discovered the necklet would not work for him nor any of our kind. This cupboard contains some of his other disappointments.\" \"There was a bit of a clamor, when you opened the doors,\" I said. \"Yes. These are human things, and they have seen no human since they were brought here.\" Pause. \"They do not love being idle. Some of them are very powerful. I can restrain them, even if I cannot use them. I would offer them to you, if...\" \"If there was any indication I wouldn\u0027t make a total botch,\" I interrupted, \"which there isn\u0027t. To the contrary, if anything.\" The question of the existence of my demon taint, never far from the front of my mind these days despite serious competition from vampires and immediate death, resurfaced long enough to register that the \"human things\" had responded to me as human. Well, if they were comparing me to Con I was a shoo-in. I didn\u0027t know how long they\u0027d been here, but a good guess was long enough to make them desperate. I touched the chain with my finger, and half-thought, half-imagined I heard a faint - the faintest of faint - hums. If I was going to say I\u0027d heard it, I\u0027d say it was a happy hum. But I wasn\u0027t going to say I\u0027d heard it. \"The Cup was my mistake.\" \"Allow me to point out that it had been a rather tiring evening already,\" I said testily, \"before I met the damn...cauldron. And I wasn\u0027t exactly prepared. Nor was I exactly introduced. Even a master handler - which I am not - can be caught off guard.\" \"The necklet will allow you to find your way back here,\" said Con. \"You may, if you wish, investigate these things further, having prepared yourself.\" I laughed a small dry croaking laugh. \"That kind of preparation takes decades of apprenticeship. Ruthless, singleminded, hair-raising apprenticeship. It also requires someone to be apprenticed to, which in my case I have not got, besides being at least fifteen years too old to start.\" And possibly calamitously partblood. After a pause, Con said, \"I too had to...invent much of my apprenticeship. A master with whom you cannot agree is sometimes worse than no master.\" Then why did you stay? I thought. \"There are few, I think, master handlers, who could have traveled the way you traveled this evening to come here, and lived.\" My capacity for invention is flash hot stark, I thought. Sucker sunshade. Disembodied radar-reconnaissance. Not to mention Bitter Chocolate Death and Killer Zebras. Pity about the rest of me. \"If you will accept advice from me I would suggest you not come that way again, except in direst need.\" \"Happy to promise that one,\" I said. \"But don\u0027t find yourself in direst need again either, okay? Or even plain old bland low-level semi-sub-dire need.\" \"Ah. No,\" said Con. \"I will promise as well. To the extent it is within my mandate.\" He closed the cupboard. I thought, if I do get back here, for my first trick I\u0027m going to transfer all that stuff out of that deeply repulsive cupboard, which I\u0027m sure isn\u0027t making any of it rest any easier. Supposing I can find anything more suitable in this baroque fun-house. \"We must be on our way. Dawn is a bare hour away.\" \"An hour?\" I said. \"You mean you\u0027re - this - is that close to - \" My dismay was hardly flattering, but Con answered with his usual detachment: \"Not in human geography. But the fact that you are here at all - by the way you came - and the necklet you now wear - you will be able to walk some of my shorter ways.\" My heart sank. \"You just told me not to use nowheresville again.\" Con said, \"I cannot travel that road any more than I can walk under the sun. I do not take you that way.\" \"Oh,\" I said. \"Well.\" I don\u0027t know how we came out above ground again, out into the ordinary night, with a little ordinary breeze and a few ordinary bats swooshing about. Bats. How quaint. I noticed they did not come from where we had come from, however. Wherever that was. I don\u0027t seem to recall coming out, like from a tunnel; the wilder, intenser darkness of Con\u0027s earth-place merely thinned and crumbled, and eventually we were walking on rough grass and turf. With bats skating overhead. I was uncomfortably reminded of my perfunctory clothing when the breeze showed a tendency to billow up inside the long black shirt, but I was so grateful to be breathing fresh air - and because I desperately wanted to be home - when Con took my hand I didn\u0027t instantly jerk it away from him again. At least he didn\u0027t offer to carry me. Even though I was barefoot again. It occurred to me that I had a pattern of being inappropriately dressed during my associations with Con. His shorter way was a little like stepping on stepping stones while the torrent foamed around your feet - in this case the torrent of that conventional reality I was so eager to return to - and threatening at any moment to surge over the edge and sweep you away. I almost certainly would have lost my balance without his hand: you had to look down to see where to put your feet, and reality careering past at Mach hundred and twelve is seriously dizzy-making, plus some of the stepping stones were dangerously slick, disconcertingly like ordinary stones in an ordinary stream, although I didn\u0027t want to think what they were slick with, nor what the equivalent of getting soaking wet might be if I fell off. It was less unnerving than the way I\u0027d gone earlier tonight, as that way was less unnerving than where Aimil\u0027s cosmail had taken me, but it was still unnerving. Very. I wondered if traveling through nowheresville was part of the You will begin, now, I think, to read those lines of...power, governance, sorcery, as I can read them, that Con had predicted a month ago. But he\u0027d said read. If this was reading I didn\u0027t want to know about doing. Then the stones seemed to get bigger and bigger and the torrent slowed and grew calm, and we were at the edge of Yolande\u0027s garden. I didn\u0027t notice him leave. I don\u0027t remember his dropping my hand. But as I recognized the shape of the house in the near-light of mundane night under the open sky, I realized I was alone. I remembered as I staggered up the porch steps, trying to avoid the creakiest ones, that I didn\u0027t have the key to my apartment. Again. At this rate I should start keeping a spare under a flowerpot for those nights I found myself doing something strange with Con while barefoot and unsuitably clothed. Maybe it was the necklet, but I put my hand over the keyhole and growled something, I don\u0027t know what, and heard the damn bolt click open. I also heard tiny ward voices chittering at me irritably, but they didn\u0027t try to stop me coming in. I rebolted the door tidily behind me. I didn\u0027t take his shirt off. I fell onto my bed and was asleep instantly. I half expected to wake up and find myself lying in a little pile of ashes, when the black vampire shirt disintegrated under the touch of the sun\u0027s rays; I more than half expected to wake up having had long, labyrinthine dream about Con with a background to match - labyrinthine, I mean. No again. (Although I remembered when I\u0027d last woken up in my bed and hoped that what I remembered about something-strange-with-Con had only been an embarrassing dream. It hadn\u0027t been a dream that time either - and the things-that-weren\u0027t-dreams were by this showing getting more embarrassing. (Speaking of patterns I wanted to break soon.) I did wake stiff as a plank from all my new scrapes and bruises, and with a crick in my neck so severe I wasn\u0027t sure I was ever going to get my face facing frontward again. I looked over my shoulder at the little heap of abandoned clothing in front of the still-open balcony door as I stumbled into the bathroom and started running hot water for a bath. I\u0027d been here before too, only last time it was the other vampires that had knocked me around. Be fair, I thought. I\u0027m in a lot better shape than I was when I got home four and a half months ago. I didn\u0027t feel like being fair. For just a moment - for fewer than the ten seconds it had lasted when it happened - I remembered his mouth on mine, his naked body hot and sweating against mine - No. I put my head under the tap and let the water blast all such thoughts away. My hair needed shampooing anyway. The shirt, although it needed a wash, still looked pretty glamorous in daylight. Good quality material. Nice drape. Even if black wasn\u0027t my color. Although at the moment a lot of me was dark blue and purple, and it coordinated very well with that. I scowled at the mirror. My own fault for looking. The chain round my neck gleamed in daylight too. It looked more like gold this morning, but if I stirred it with a finger it had a queer iridescent quality not at all like real gold, not that I had much acquaintance with the stuff. I had always favored plastic and rhinestones. I took the shirt off carefully and put it with the other laundry. Was it natural fibers, I wondered, did it need to be dry-cleaned? I had somehow neglected to ask Con about these crucial details. Borrowing shirts from ordinary guys wasn\u0027t this complicated. For one thing, ordinary-guy shirts usually had washing instruction tags in them. This one didn\u0027t have any tags. I took my bath and wondered if I was going to make it in to the coffeehouse for the lunch shift. I wasn\u0027t anything like as bad off as I had been last spring. I was just sulky. I only took one bath. By the time the water had cooled from scalding to merely hot I could almost turn my head again. I left the rainbow chain round my neck during my bath. I didn\u0027t want to take it off somehow, and I doubted that bubble bath was going to tarnish it. What I did do was introduce it to my other talismans. I hadn\u0027t a clue how to clean up after last night\u0027s magic - none of the words my gran had taught me seemed at all suitable, I felt kind of put off candles and herbs, and I wasn\u0027t in a very thank you mood. But I knew I should be doing something. This was a compromise. As a solemn rite it wasn\u0027t much: I was cross-legged on the very rucked-up sheets of my bed, and still dripping from the bath, wrapped in an assortment of towels. I had pulled my little knife from the pants pocket of the trousers on the floor, and took the mysterious seal out of the bed-table drawer. I smoothed a bit of pillow and laid them there. Then, gently, I lifted the chain off over my head, and dropped it down around them. I don\u0027t know what I was expecting. It just seemed like the thing to do. Knife, meet necklace. Seal, meet necklace. Necklace, meet knife and seal. I suspect we are going into some kind of fracas together, and that you are my co-conspirators - you and that underground guy - and I want to make sure you\u0027re all on speaking terms with one another before I ask you to guard my back. Or something. It was too late in the year for direct sunlight to touch my pillow at that time of day. So I don\u0027t know what happened. But there was a flash like - well, like a ray of sunshine, but it was some ray: like a golden sword, like a Christian saint\u0027s vision of glory. It landed on my talismans with an almost audible whump, like the king\u0027s grip had slipped and he\u0027d clobbered the knight on the shoulder instead of merely tapping gently and dubbing him Sir Thing. And the pillow caught fire. I sat there with steam suddenly boiling off my wet towels, my mouth open, staring. And my brain had gone on vacation without advance warning, because I reached into the fire, closed my hands around my three talismans, gathered them together, and pulled them out of the fire. The fire went out. The pillow lay there, charred and smoking. My hands felt a little hot. No big deal. When I opened my hands there were three overlapping red marks on the palms: one long thin almost rectangular oval, for the knife, one smaller shorter fatter oval for the seal, and a scarlet curl over the ball of one thumb, a slightly ragged thread-width stripe, for the chain. None of the objects themselves now felt any more than human-body-temperature warm. None of them looked a trace different than they had a minute before. Before they had been set on fire by persons or forces unknown. \"Oh,\" I said. My voice quavered. \"Oh my.\" I made it in for the lunch shift all right. I didn\u0027t want to stay home alone with myself. I hung the chain round my neck again, and put the knife and the seal in two separate pockets. I didn\u0027t feel like leaving anything in the bed-table drawer any more. We\u0027d bonded or something - speaking of weird bonds. Our affiliation had been confirmed by setting one pillow on fire. I put the pillow in the trash and the sheets in the washing machine. My sheets had never been so clean as they\u0027d been in the last few months. I hardly got them on again before something else happened and I was feverishly ripping them off and stuffing them in the wash with double amounts of soap and all the \"extra\" buttons pushed: extra wash, extra rinse, extra water, extra spin, extra protection against things that go bump in the night. Unfortunately I never could find that last button. Some day soon I\u0027d buy another pillow and a new set of pillowcases. Turned out once I was dressed in long sleeves and a high neck and jeans you didn\u0027t see the bruises much. There was one on my jawline that was going to be visible as soon as I tied my hair back and a gouge down my forearm that I decided I had to put a bandage on even if this made it look worse than it was. Couldn\u0027t be helped. You can\u0027t ooze in a public bakery any more than you can cook anything without rolling your sleeves up first. I\u0027d worry what to tell Mel later. Paulie was glad to see me. It had been a busy morning, but then it was always a busy morning. \"We\u0027re full up with SOFs,\" he said. I grunted. I\u0027d seen them on the way in, glancing through the door to the front, having thoughtfully come in the side way for staff only (and hungry derelicts), just in case of things like SOFs. I put a clean apron on and tied my hair up at lightning speed (lightning bolt, golden sword, Mach hundred and twelve), threw a little flour in my face to camouflage the bruise on my jaw, and was up to my elbows in pastry by the time Pat had drifted apparently aimlessly into the bakery. I hadn\u0027t seen him on my way in; he\u0027d been moving pretty fast himself if they\u0027d called him over from HQ. \"A word with you on your next break?\" he said. \"I\u0027ve only just got here,\" I said, smudging flour and butter and confectioner\u0027s sugar together briskly. \"Whenever,\" he said, loitering. \"It\u0027ll be a couple of hours,\" I said quellingly. I could feel Paulie raising his eyebrows behind my back: Pat was usually a friend with privileges. That had been before I\u0027d found out my loyalties were not merely divided, they had hacked me in two and were disappearing over the horizon in opposite directions. \"Whatever you say, ma\u0027am,\" he said, saluting, although not very convincingly. \"I don\u0027t suppose there are any cinnamon rolls left?\" \"No,\" I said. \"Walnut sticky bun?\" said Paulie. \"Blueberry muffin, pumpkin muffin, orange, carrot and oat muffin, pear gingerbread, honeycake?\" \"One of each,\" said Pat, and disappeared. Paulie hadn\u0027t been with us long enough yet to pretend to be impervious to the sincere flattery of people gorging themselves on the stuff you had made. He rubbed his face with a sugary hand to disguise the grin and went off to load up a plate and shout for Mary to take it out front. I was tempted not to admit when I went on break but I was having to do enough lying just plugging through my days - and nights - and didn\u0027t want to get too used to it. It was like I didn\u0027t want to forget the difference between daylight and nighttime: and both my funny eyes and my funny new life-and-undead style seemed to be prodding me relentlessly in that direction. Not funny. My sunshine-self. My tree-self. My deer-self. Didn\u0027t we outnumber the dark self? My hands patted the two pockets that contained the knife and the seal, leaving two more smudges on my apron. I took the apron off and washed my hands and made myself a cup of tea and went out front. Pat had either come back or was still there. Paulie\u0027s piled-up plate two and a half hours ago hadn\u0027t been enough; he was now eating Lemon Lust pastry bars and Killer Zebras. Any normal human ought to have a gut he\u0027d have to carry around on a wheelbarrow, the way he ate. This had crossed my mind once or twice before, being many years acquainted with Pat\u0027s eating habits, but he was SOF, you know? So he got a lot of exercise and had a high metabolism rate. I wondered again what kind of demon he was. If he was a rubberfoot, which came in blue sometimes, he could walk up walls, for example, which must burn a lot of calories. I nodded to him and went out to sit on the wall of Mrs. Bialosky\u0027s flower bed. The sun was shining. He followed me. \"Listen to the news last night?\" he said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sunshine/page-20.html","bookId":2085,"book":{"id":2085,"title":"Sunshine","description":"Storyline: The story is set in an alternate universe, taking place after the “Voodoo Wars”, a conflict between humans and the “Others”.
