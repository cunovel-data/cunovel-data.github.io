I suppressed a shudder. \"No.\"\n \"One killed and three missing in No Town,\" he said. \"The one killed is confirmed sucker.\"\n \"You can\u0027t be sure this soon that the other three are anything but missing,\" I said. \"Maybe they ran away.\"\n Pat looked at me.\n \"They may have run away from something else,\" I said, \"that had nothing to do with vampires.\"\n \"The moon may be one of Sunshine\u0027s Killer Zebras, but I doubt it,\" said Pat. \"A lot of people saw these four hanging around together earlier in the evening.\"\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"Four is a lot for one night, even in No Town.\"\n I still didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"We\u0027d like you to come round this afternoon and have another stroll through a few cosmails,\" said Pat.\n \"I don\u0027t get off till ten tonight.\"\n \"We\u0027ll wait,\" Pat said grimly. \"There\u0027s one little snag - Aimil doesn\u0027t want to do it. She says you tried it on your own a few days ago and it took you away somewhere. She said she thought you\u0027d died. Now, why would you want to try it on your own, I wonder?\"\n \"Why do you think?\" I said, looking at him steadily. The shadows on his face lay plain and clean. I slid a little further into my strange seeing. These shadows had a slightly rough or textured quality I was beginning to guess meant partblood - I\u0027d seen it in Maud\u0027s face first, but Aimil had it too - and in Pat\u0027s case this not-quite-human aspect was distinctly blue. But the shadows said there was no deceit beyond the basic subterfuge of passing for pureblood human. Pat was who he said he was, and believed what he said he believed. \"I want to find these guys too,\" I said. \"And SOF, begging your pardon, makes me nervous.\"\n Pat sighed and rubbed his head with his hand, making his short SOF-norm hair stand on end. \"Look, kiddo, I know all the usual complaints about SOF and I agree with most of them.\" He saw me looking at his hair and smiled a little. \"So I don\u0027t happen to mind the hair and the uniform, that\u0027s not a crime, is it? But we can protect you better at SOF HQ than you can protect yourself anywhere else. What if what you were tracking had noticed you were searching for it the other day? You think you could have got back out fast enough for it not to follow you home? The fact that Aimil is still alive proves that it didn\u0027t notice. But I think that was dumb luck. Nobody has ever lived a long happy life depending on dumb luck, and depending on any kind of luck is as good as tearing your own throat out when you\u0027re messing with suckers. I don\u0027t care what extra powers you got, Sunshine.\"\n I swallowed. \"Did you say all that to Aimil?\"\n \"You bet I did, babe, and more besides. She is, after all, on our payroll and subject to our rules. You aren\u0027t. Yet, although I\u0027ve thought about it. But SOF doesn\u0027t pay so good and generally we have to blackmail people like you and Aimil, to put it bluntly, not to mention figuring out what the official description of what we wanted you for would be. I could probably tie you up in a big knot of top-secret intelligence bureaucracy - we\u0027ve got powers to compel ordinary citizens in certain circumstances, did you know that? And we could make these the right kind of circumstances, never fear - but it would take too long and I suspect it would make you ornery. We need you too badly to risk pissing you off, if we can get you any other way. By the way, you were planning on coming to us with anything you found on the other end of Aimil\u0027s cosmails, weren\u0027t you? You don\u0027t have any noble, suicidal plans to take these suckers on by yourself, do you? Tell me you are not that stupid.\"\n I said with perfect honesty, \"I have no intention of trying to take these suckers on by myself, no.\"\n Pat looked at me with a slight frown. \"Why doesn\u0027t that sound as reassuring as it should?\"\n I gazed back at him as innocently as I could.\n He sighed. \"Never mind. We\u0027ll see you at ten tonight. In fact, I\u0027ll come by myself at closing.\"\n \"I\u0027m not going to sneak out the back way and go home if I\u0027ve told you I\u0027ll come,\" I said, annoyed.\n \"You haven\u0027t actually said you will come,\" said Pat calmly, \"and I don\u0027t want you walking around by yourself at that hour, in case Bozo gets wise between now and then.\"\n This was a little too near a little too much of the truth. \"Bozo?\" I said carefully. \"Do you have a name?\"\n \"Have we ever had a name?\" said Pat. \"You find \u0027em and you stake \u0027em and then you burn \u0027em to be sure. But we\u0027re obviously chasing a master vampire here, and it\u0027s easier if we call him something. Assuming it\u0027s a him, which they usually are. So we\u0027re calling him Bozo. So, are you saying you\u0027ll be waiting for me at ten tonight then?\"\n \"But if Aimil - \"\n \"I\u0027ll tell her you\u0027re coming anyway and we\u0027ve got that cosmail saved and we can do it without her if we have to. She can either come be part of the safety net or sit at home waiting for really bad news and be hauled over the carpet and messily fired later on.\"\n \"What sweethearts you SOFs are,\" I said.\n There was no humor at all in Pat\u0027s face when he replied: \"Yeah. But we\u0027re real devoted to the idea of keeping the live alive. What did you do to your chin - and your arm? Is that from when you fell out of Aimil\u0027s chair?\"\n \"Must be,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t remember that well.\"\n It was a fairly ordinary day at the coffeehouse. We had one crazy wander in off the street who wanted to tell all of us that the end of the world was coming. He had an interesting variant of the standard format: in his reading the moon was going to be moved in front of the sun and kept there to create a permanent eclipse while the creatures of dark took over down here. The moon would be held in place by the something-o-meter invented by the creatures of dark and which they were presently perfecting. He said \"creatures of dark,\" not \"vampires.\" I suppose I was in a twitchy mood anyway, but I didn\u0027t like this. There are lots of creatures of the dark, but I would have said that except for vampires none of them is bright enough to invent a something-o-meter. So why didn\u0027t he say vampires? He did say eighteen months, tops, before the eclipse began.\n It was a good thing he hadn\u0027t washed in a while and raved like a loony or some of us might have believed him. I told myself his story would make a good novel. It would sure make a better novel than it would a reality. Mel got rid of him. Mel goes all Good Old Boy amiable and eases them out the door, and the thing about it is that when Mel does it, they don\u0027t come back. The only times we\u0027ve ever had to call the cops is when Mel hasn\u0027t been there. Ranting crazies make Charlie nervous. Because this is Old Town we get a fair number of crazies: hell, we feed most of them, out the side door, but not so many of them rant. Charlie can soothe a customer determined to pick a fight when Mel would just throw him out the first time he swore at one of the waitresses, and I\u0027d back Mel against most brawlers, but taking them on their own terms isn\u0027t a good way to avoid calling the cops. Sometimes I think more throwing out would be a good thing - we have enough customers, we don\u0027t need to put up with the flaming assholes - but Charlie\u0027s is Charlie\u0027s because of Charlie, which is probably a good thing too. But Mel is the one who deals with the noisy nutters. If there\u0027s ever a Mel\u0027s it will be racier. And Charlie\u0027s will have to hire a bouncer with a degree in counseling.\n This crazy came in during the lull between the late-afternoon muffin-and-scone crowd and the early supper eaters so there weren\u0027t too many people around. Mrs. Bialosky was there, and I didn\u0027t like the way she listened to him either: it seemed to me she was having some of the same thoughts I was. Maybe she was just thinking about full moons. The crazy hadn\u0027t mentioned what was going to happen about the moon\u0027s phases. He must not be a Were himself.\n \"Hey, a little live entertainment for slack time,\" Mel said to me. \"This one missed the mark, okay, next time I\u0027ll get jugglers.\" I smiled, because he wanted me to, but I noticed he was rubbing one of his tattoos: the hourglass one, that you can\u0027t see which way the sand is running. It\u0027s a charm about not running out of time. He\u0027d been listening to the crazy too.\n I couldn\u0027t see into the shadows on Mel\u0027s face. They flickered less than some but the red edges were more dazzling as if to make up for this. I didn\u0027t know if I couldn\u0027t see past the dazzle because I couldn\u0027t couldn\u0027t, or because I didn\u0027t want to. If I didn\u0027t want to, what was it I was afraid I was going to be seeing?\n By ten o\u0027clock I was tired, and I wanted to go home and go to bed. I had a lot of sleep to catch up on. The last thing I wanted to do was slope off to SOF HQ and plug into another live socket and fry my brains some more, but when Kyoko came into the bakery to tell me Pat was in front waiting for me, I didn\u0027t duck out the back door - even though I hadn\u0027t promised. I may have given the cinnamon-roll sponge a few more vicious stirs than it needed, but then I threw my apron into the laundry, washed off the worst of the day\u0027s spatters and stains, and went to meet my fate.\n I paused briefly under the doorway. A few days ago I\u0027d tacked up a string over the lintel, so I could stuff some of Mom\u0027s charms up there. They balanced on the narrow lintel edge and were kept from pitching over by the string. She hadn\u0027t said anything, but then we\u0027d never discussed the fact that she was coming into the bakery when I wasn\u0027t there (she rarely crossed the threshold when I was) and leaving charms round about. Well, so, the glove compartment was full. Or she was wearing me down. And they wouldn\u0027t last long trying to protect a doorway that had people coming and going through it all the time, but at least they could keep their eyes (so to speak) on me when I was there. And while they still had what in charms passes for eyes.\n The funny thing was that I\u0027d begun to feel them there, and kind of didn\u0027t mind. I\u0027ve said that charms usually rub me up the wrong way, like a rash, or a colicky baby living in the spare bedroom whose mom sleeps deeper than you do. And when I stood under the doorway for a moment I felt their - well, their good will, I\u0027m not sure it was any stronger than that - soaking in. I felt like a baba sucking up rum. Or possibly chopped piccalilli vegetables vinegar. I shook my head to make the opalescent chain swish over my skin and patted my pockets.\n Pat and I walked over, to my surprise. \"I kinda want to know if there\u0027s anyone close enough to make a pass at you,\" said Pat. \"Hope you got a table knife in your pocket.\"\n \"Very funny,\" I said.\n \"Shouldn\u0027t be necessary,\" said Pat, unfazed. \"I got a few of ours skulking in the shadows, ready to race to our rescue.\"\n This was not comforting, not so much because a vampire could have struck in from nowhere and killed us both before any human defender had done any more than take a deep breath and wonder if there was a problem, but because of what SOF didn\u0027t know about my extracurricular activities. I didn\u0027t want SOF watching me that closely. And I didn\u0027t like their spending that kind of expensive human time on me. \"You sound like you\u0027re taking this very seriously.\"\n \"You betcha.\"\n \"Why? You haven\u0027t got any proof yet that what Aimil and I are doing is anything but psycho doodling.\"\n Pat was silent a moment, and then gave a heavy sigh. \"You know, Sunshine, you\u0027re a pain to work with. You think too much. Have you read anything about the little black boxes that are supposed to register Other activity? Called tickers.\"\n \"Yeah. They don\u0027t work.\"\n \"Actually they work pretty well. The problem is that there is a larger number of unregistered partbloods in the general pop than anyone wants to talk about - well gosh isn\u0027t that surprising - and the tickers keep getting confused. Or, you know, sabotaged. It\u0027s been a real bad problem in SOF for some reason. Can\u0027t imagine why. There\u0027s ways around this problem, however, once you all know you\u0027re reading off the same page. So we got some tickers that give us pretty good readings, once we figured out how to set \u0027em up. And I\u0027ll tell you that a couple we got down in No Town about fused their chips when you did your locating trick for us a few days ago, and they did it again that afternoon when, it turns out, you were committing your felony with Aimil.\"\n \"Felony my ass,\" I said.\n \"Attempting to consort with an enemy alien is a felony, my pretty darling, and all Others are enemy aliens. It\u0027s not one of those rules anyone wants to pursue too close, but it has its uses. And trying to locate \u0027em is near enough to trying to consort with \u0027em for me. Anyway, we\u0027ve never had readings like these readings. What you\u0027re up to may be psycho doodlings, all right, but they\u0027re great big strong psycho doodlings and we\u0027re beginning to hope you may be the best chance we\u0027ve seen in years and not another one of my over-optimistic bad calls.\"\n I considered having a nervous breakdown on the spot. I probably could have thrown a good one too, about how I couldn\u0027t take the strain, that my life had crashed and burned those two nights I went missing by the lake and all Pat and SOF were doing now was stamping out the ashes and oh by the way if you have an axe handy I\u0027ll run mad with it now and get it over with since my genes are being slower off the mark than I\u0027ve been expecting since I figured it out two months or whatever ago, and by the way, that was SOF\u0027s doing too, you guys and your sidelong suggestive little chats. While half my brain was considering the nervous breakdown recourse the other half was considering whether maybe I could locate Bo well enough and then let SOF handle it. Con and I wouldn\u0027t have to go within miles (vampire miles or human miles) of No Town. We could sit at home drinking champagne and waiting for the headlines: NEW ARCADIA SOF DIVISION ELIMINATES MAJOR VAMPIRE LAIR AND DESTROYS ITS MASTER. Our correspondent, blah blah blah.\n My imagination wanted MOST IMPORTANT STRIKE SINCE VOODOO WARS, but it wouldn\u0027t be. It felt global to me because it was my life on the line.\n But it wasn\u0027t going to happen that way. I didn\u0027t even know why, not to be able to explain it. But I could feel it, like you feel a stomachache or a cold coming on, or somebody\u0027s eyes staring a hole in your back. SOF could go in and mess things up for a little while, stake a few young vampires and maybe wreck Bo\u0027s immediate plans. But...maybe this was something else I was learning to see in the shadows. Maybe it was from traveling through nowheresville or walking Con\u0027s short ways last night when I was somewhere else: watching my reality stream by, finding out there are other places with other rules. I was beginning to understand how the connections in the vampire world really aren\u0027t like our human connections in our human world.\n I was tethered to Con as absolutely as he had been shackled to the wall of the house beside the lake. And he and Bo had a bond that required one of them to be the cause of the destruction of the other one. I guessed now that this was as natural a situation to a vampire as making cinnamon rolls was to me. I wondered what happened if a vampire involved in one of these lethal pacts did the vampire equivalent of falling under a bus: did the other one, foiled of catharsis, spin off into the void instead? The really nasty void, that is. Which could explain why it was so godsbloodyawful a place to visit.\n He could have warned me, I thought. Con could have said something, that second morning by the lake. Would it have occurred to him? No. Besides, what was he going to say? \"Die now or later\"? That had been the choice all along. And as far as my situation now being the mere sad inevitable result of my being in the wrong place at the wrong time: grow up, Sunshine. Bo would be just a tiny bit irritated with me personally. Having not only escaped but taken his prize prisoner with me. What had kept me alive so far - my scorned and ignored magic-handling talent, my reluctant and harrowing alliance with Con - was also what was causing the bond. Ordinary mortals don\u0027t get bound up in ceremonial duels to the death with master vampires. But ordinary mortals don\u0027t survive introductory vampire encounters either.\n I cast back to that second morning at the lake and thought, he did warn me - or remind me. I just didn\u0027t hear it. Why should I? And why should he think I needed warning? \"...That we are both gone will mean that something truly extraordinary has happened. And it almost certainly has something to do with you - as it does, does it not? - and that therefore something important about you was overlooked. And Bo will like that even less than he would have liked the straightforward escape of an ordinary human prisoner. He will order his folk to follow. We must not make it easy for them.\" I was the one who\u0027d assumed the time limitations around Con\u0027s annotations of our predicament.\n More recently Con had said, I knew what happened at the lake would not be the end. And it wasn\u0027t like I\u0027d been surprised.\n Okay, what if - just as a matter of keeping our position clear here - what if we managed to off Bo now? What new chains of vengeance and retaliation would we have forged instead?\n I wanted to laugh, but I didn\u0027t want to come up with a likely story to explain to Pat what I was finding to laugh at. Unless I wanted to make the laughter hysterical, as a lead-in to my nervous breakdown.\n But I didn\u0027t. I wanted to find Bo and get on with it. Whatever happened next. Whatever. I would think about whatever if there was a tomorrow to think about it in. Right now today was enough - like getting away from the lake alive had been enough. If Aimil\u0027s cosmail was Bo, and I could trace it, and SOF could offer some protection from being traced back, then I\u0027d risk doing it with SOF. I wanted to find Bo. And hadn\u0027t I just been saying there was a bond between Bo and me as well? Big ugly mega yuck.\n What I didn\u0027t want was to get sucked in again and maybe somehow this time pop out on top of Bo. As things I couldn\u0027t bear to think about went, this was very high on the list.\n My sunshine-self, my tree-self, my deer-self. Didn\u0027t we outnumber the dark self?\n What I had to figure out, fast, was if there was going to be a way I could make a mark, leave a clue, carry some bad-void token away with me that Con and I could follow or interpret better or faster than SOF could. There\u0027d been kind of a lot going on and I hadn\u0027t sorted what I had found - or half found, or begun to find - in Aimil\u0027s living room. If sorting was a possibility. Aimil had been afraid I\u0027d died...\n No. I\u0027d figure it out. I had to.\n Did the tickers do anything but register activity, could they define it?\n They\u0027d pick up Con and me too, when we started going somewhere - wouldn\u0027t they? If. Supposing our rough human-world guesses were right, and what we all wanted was in No Town. But...if SOF was now going to start keeping a closer watch on me, were they going to plant a ticker near Yolande\u0027s house? Oh, gods. Could she disable a SOF ticker?\n Aimil, looking subdued, was waiting in Pat\u0027s office, with Jesse and Theo. She got up from her chair and put her arms around me. I hugged her back and we stared at each other a moment. \"I guess these guys worked you over so the bruises don\u0027t show,\" I said.\n \"Which is more than can be said for you,\" said Aimil, touching my jaw gently.\n \"I got that doing chin-ups on the top oven,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s get on with this, can we? I want to go home and go to bed. Four in the morning is already soon.\"\n Pat\u0027s combox was on, and the saved cosmail winked at us as soon as he touched the screen. Even before plugging in to the live connection it looked evil to me; the flickering print seemed to have a kind of bulgy red edge, so that it looked like tiny scarlet mouths howling behind every letter of every word. \"Ready?\" said Pat.\n I sat down and put my hands on the keyboard, like I was going to do some perfectly ordinary com thing, tap a few keys, see what the headlines were on the Darkline. \"Ready,\" I said. He pressed the globenet button and the mail went live.\n I was almost sucked in after all. Hey, I didn\u0027t know what I was doing. Was there an apprenticeship for this? The globenet hasn\u0027t been around all that long, but magic handlers adapt pretty fast - they have to. If I\u0027d been apprenticed, could I have learned how to trace a cosmail? No. If this was something magic handlers now routinely did, SOF would have a division of magic handlers that did it. And they wouldn\u0027t be all over me like a cheap suit. I was going where no one had gone before. And I wasn\u0027t having a good time.\n It was my talismans that held me together, and in this world. I felt them heat up, wow, like zero to a hundred in nothing flat with the throttle all the way open, like a cold inert vampire being brought back to undeadness by a surprise drop-in guest. I guessed there was a red hoop around my neck and over my breast now, and a red oval on each thigh. I hoped they wouldn\u0027t set my clothes on fire, which might be hard to explain as well as embarrassing.\n It was pretty excruciating. It was like being dragged forward and hauled backward simultaneously: as if I was living the moment when my divided loyalties ripped me apart and took off with their riven halves. Other-space yawned, and while last night, with Con at the far end of the back-country-lane version, it had merely been remote and unearthly and nowhere I had any business being, tonight it was the bad one again, the shrieking maelstrom. If I went headfirst into this one I wouldn\u0027t come out, except in small messy pieces.\n But I was frisking on the boundary of dangerous territory for a purpose. Dimly through the inaudible din, I thought, perhaps this is Bo\u0027s defense system. Okay, if I can find where the defense system is, presumably I can find where what it\u0027s defending is. Or is that too human a logic? I tried to orient myself, carefully, carefully, staying firmly seated on the chair in Pat\u0027s office, feeling my talismans burning their variously shaped holes into my flesh. I wasn\u0027t the compass needle myself this time - that would have been too far in - I was trying to angle for a view so I could see where the compass needle pointed...\n There.\n And I was flung over backward, with the chair, and landed on the floor so hard the breath was knocked out of me. This was just as well, because Pat\u0027s combox exploded; droplets of superheated flying goo rained down on me as well as tiny fragments of gods-know-what, and larger pieces of plastic housing. There were a few half-muffled shouts of surprise and pain, and then there were a lot of alarm bells ringing. I was still struggling to get some breath back in my lungs when people started arriving. I had thought those were real alarm bells. They were.\n What looked like everybody at SOF headquarters poured into Pat\u0027s room, and there were more of them than you\u0027d think for ten-thirty at night. Once I could breathe again I could tell the medic I wasn\u0027t hurt. (There are medics on duty twenty-four-seven at SOF HQ: our tax blinks at work. Well, okay, lots of big corps have medics on duty, but few of them have combat patches. This one did.) My shirt had got a little torn, somehow, and the chain and the mark it made were visible; he gave me some burn cream for the latter, while he muttered something about the weird effects of a combox blowout. Fortunately it didn\u0027t seem to occur to him to suggest that there was something funny about my necklace and I shouldn\u0027t wear it. I didn\u0027t mention the hot spots I could feel on my thighs. I was glad still to have thighs.\n Pat had fared the worst; he needed stitches in one shoulder where he was hit by the biggest single chunk of flying combox, and had several inelegant burn marks on his face and one hand, although none of them serious. \"Hey, I was an ugly bastard before,\" he said. \"It\u0027s not gonna ruin my social life.\" Even Pat had been rattled, however, because the two guys who rushed in and sat down at the other combox in the room - one of them with a headset he kept muttering into - had been tapping away intently for several minutes before Pat noticed. I had been watching them as I lay on the floor, but I was pretty hazed out myself and hadn\u0027t managed to think about what they might be doing. I had half-noticed Jesse doing an ordinary startled-human stillness thing when those two came in, but I hadn\u0027t registered it. I did register Pat snapping into awareness and then exchanging a hard look with Jesse.\n And then the woman came in and the tension level in the room went off the scale. I felt like we were in one of those old-fashioned movie rockets where the Gs of escape velocity crush you into the upholstery. Okay, so my metaphors had taken a wrong turn, but when I first looked at her there were no shadows on her at all: it was as if she was glowing, in great sick-making waves, like a walking nuclear reactor or something, if I had ever seen a nuclear reactor, which I have not. Instant headache. Instant wanting-to-be-out-of-here, wherever here was; hereness seemed to fade under the onslaught of her mere presence.\n This had to be the goddess of pain. And I had thought that name was just a joke. Uh-oh.\n She snapped a few undertone orders to one of the fellows with the headset; he was obviously not happy, and he shook his head. His partner in crime shrugged and spread his hands. \"Your little stunt has just bombed HQ\u0027s entire com system,\" she said in a cold clear voice that was worse than any shouting. \"What the hell are you doing?\"\n Pat, almost visibly pulling himself together, said, \"I had clearance. Ask Sanchez.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t have clearance to close the regional HQ down, and you obviously didn\u0027t do your homework about safeguards,\" said the woman, not a split atom\u0027s worth mollified. \"You still haven\u0027t told me what you were trying to do, and Sanchez isn\u0027t here.\"\n One of the headset guys on the other combox barked something, and she listened to them briefly. When she turned to glare at Pat again he was a little more ready for her. \"We were trying to trace an Other cosmail to a land source. We have been working with Aimil, here,\" nodding to her, \"for some months. This is Rae Seddon, whom we had reason to believe might be able to help us. This is the second time she\u0027s tried to make a connection. As for safeguards, I...\" and he ran off into a lot of technical jargon I didn\u0027t understand a syllable of, and didn\u0027t want to. I tuned out.\n By this time I was breathing again, although my lungs felt sore. Not nearly as sore as my head, however. My eyeballs felt like they were embedded in glass splinters and my entire skull throbbed. I was now seeing a fat glaring red edge to everything, an erratic fat glaring red edge, sometimes as wide as a pocketknife, sometimes as narrow as an opalescent chain. It didn\u0027t need shadows. It looked like cracks in reality, opening into the chaos I\u0027d seen protecting the way to Bo through nowheresville. I clung to the arms of the re-righted chair I\u0027d been helped into once the medic was done with me.\n \"Hold still,\" he said. He was trying to put stitches in Pat\u0027s shoulder. I didn\u0027t want to look at the goddess of pain again; I knew it was my eyes, but there was something really wrong about her, and whatever it was, it made my headache worse.\n I watched a couple of people gathering up pieces of combox. Another person appeared bearing a big bottle of some kind of, presumably, solvent, and was wiping up the littler gel blobs. Somebody else was flipping the bigger blobs into a bucket. I noticed that some of them left marks behind them. Jesse had minor burns on one forearm; Theo and Aimil hadn\u0027t been touched. It could have been a lot worse.\n It was a lot worse. It just wasn\u0027t about being burned by combox gel.\n My red edges were, I thought, narrowing. Not fast enough.\n I didn\u0027t notice the pause in the conversation till I heard my name being repeated. \"Rae Seddon,\" the goddess was saying. I jerked my eyes up - and flinched: neither my eyes nor my head was ready for sudden movements - and equally unequal to meeting the goddess\u0027 eyes. \"I heard about the incident a few weeks ago,\" she said, \"with the vampire in Old Town.\"\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"I\u0027d quite like to have a chat with you myself sometime,\" she said.\n I still didn\u0027t say anything. I glanced at Pat. He was so poker-faced I knew he was worried. There was a big red halo around his head, and the shadows across his face were so blue I was surprised they weren\u0027t obvious to everyone. I hoped they weren\u0027t.\n \"I doubt I can help you,\" I said, not looking at her. \"I think it was an accident.\"\n \"Some power residue from your experience at the lake?\" she said. I didn\u0027t like having her so up on my history. I wondered what else she knew. \"Yes, I agree that that is the most likely. But it is the first such incident I\u0027m aware of in any of our records\" - did this mean she was interested enough to have had research done on it? - \"and I would like to know as much about it as possible. SOF is always interested in unusual and unique cases. We have to be.\" She smiled. I saw it out of the corner of my eye. It wasn\u0027t that she didn\u0027t mean it, exactly. It was that it was an official lubricant-on-the-sticky-gears-of-community smile. It suited her aura of poisonous gases. A toxic oil slick on the sea of society. I didn\u0027t like the smile. I found Pat\u0027s single-minded commitment to the total annihilation of vampires a little inopportune but I believed he was one of the good guys. I didn\u0027t believe she was.\n I didn\u0027t smile back. I tried to look too beat up from what had happened to be able to smile. I wasn\u0027t. What I was was too beat up to make myself smile when I didn\u0027t want to.\n \"I assume that tonight\u0027s misguided attempt at a connection was also based on some faulty reading of that same residue?\"\n The tone of her voice could have made cinnamon rolls unroll, cakes fall, and Bitter Chocolate Death melt. I hoped cravenly that she was talking to Pat.\n Pat said, \"There\u0027s a precedent. Milenkovic - \"\n \"You\u0027ll have to do better than that, Agent Velasquez,\" interrupted the goddess. \"Milenkovic was a senile old woman.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sunshine/page-21.html","bookId":2085,"book":{"id":2085,"title":"Sunshine","description":"Storyline: \n The story is set in an alternate universe, taking place after the “Voodoo Wars”, a conflict between humans and the “Others”.
