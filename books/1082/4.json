{"id":29036,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV.","content":"Bonnibel ran forward and threw herself on her lover\u0027s breast in a passion of tears. \n \n \"You know all then, my darling?\" holding her fast against his wildly-throbbing heart. \n \n She could not speak for the sobs that came heaving from her aching little heart. \n \n [Pg 13] \n \n Bonnibel had never wept so wildly in all her life. It seemed to her that she would die of her grief as she lay panting and weeping in Leslie\u0027s tender arms. \n \n \"Do not weep so, my little love,\" he whispered. \"We were too sanguine of success. But try to bear it bravely, my Bonnibel. We both are young. We can bear to wait a few years until my success is assured, and then I will claim you for my own in spite of all the world!\" \n \n Bonnibel did not answer. She continued to sob heart-brokenly, and Leslie could feel her little heart beating wildly against his breast as if it would burst with the strain of her grief. \n \n So absorbed was he in trying to comfort the agitated girl that he did not hear the sound of an approaching footstep. \n \n The next moment Wild Madge, the sibyl, stood before them, and the echo of her weird and mocking laugh blent strangely with the hollow beat of the Atlantic waves. \n \n \"Aha,\" she cried discordantly. \"You weep, my bonny maid! Ah! said I not that the clouds of sorrow hung low over that golden head?\" \n \n Bonnibel started and clung closer to her lover, while a tremor shook her frame. \n \n Leslie turned angrily and rebuked the old woman. \n \n \"Begone!\" he said sternly. \"How dare you come prowling about this lady with your croakings of evil? Never dare to address her again.\" \n \n Wild Madge retreated a few steps and stood looking at him malevolently in the moonlight. Again her laugh rang out mockingly. \n \n \"Never fear, fond lover, Wild Madge would not harm a hair of that bonny head you shelter on your breast. But destiny is stronger than you or I. Her doom is written. Take the little maid in your arms and spring out into the sea there, and save her from the heart-aches that are beginning now!\" \n \n \"Begone, I say!\" reiterated the young artist threateningly. \n \n \"I obey you,\" said the sibyl, retreating, with her mocking, discordant laugh still ringing in their ears. \n \n \"Bonnibel,\" he whispered, \"look up, my sweet one. The crazy old creature is gone. You need not fear her predictions—they mean nothing! Try and calm yourself and listen to me. I have much to say to you to-night for it is the last time we shall meet until I come to claim my bride. In a few hours I must leave here. To-morrow I shall be on a steamer bound for Europe.\" \n \n \"So soon?\" she gasped brokenly, stifling her anguished sobs. \n \n \"The sooner the better, darling. I must not dally here when I have so much work to do. Remember I have fame and fortune to conquer before we meet again!\" \n \n \"It will be so long,\" she moaned, slipping out of his arms and sinking down on the pebbly beach with her face hidden in her hands. \n \n Leslie picked up the shawl which had slipped from her shoulders and wrapped it carefully about her, for the sea-air was chilly and damp. \n \n \"It may seem long to us now, dear,\" he said, sitting down beside[Pg 14] her, \"but in reality it will pass very quickly. I shall work very hard with such a prize in view, and I hope the time of our separation will not be long. I shall go at once to Rome and place myself under the best masters. I have genius, for I feel it within me, and the critics already admit it. Never fear, darling, but that my success will be speedy and sure.\" \n \n \"But away off to Rome,\" said the girl. \"Oh! Leslie, that seems as if you were going out of the world. Why need you go to Italy? Cannot you study here in this country?\" \n \n \"Not so well, my little love, as in Italy, where I can have better masters, and better facilities for studying the paintings of the world\u0027s greatest artists in the beautiful old churches and cathedrals. I must have the best instruction, for I want to make the name you will bear an honored one.\" \n \n She lifted her beautiful, tear-wet face in the moonlight, and said, gently and simply: \n \n \"We need not wait for fame and fortune, Leslie. Take me with you now.\" \n \n For a minute Leslie Dane could not speak. She waited, patiently for her, laying her hands in his, and looking up into his face with eyes beautiful enough to lead a man\u0027s heart astray and bewilder his reason. \n \n \"My child,\" he said, presently, \"I wish that I might do so, but you know not what you ask. You have been reared in the lap of luxury and pride. You could not live through the deprivation and poverty I must endure before I conquer success.\" \n \n \"I could bear anything better than the separation from you, Leslie,\" said the poor child, who had but the faintest idea what those two words, \"poverty and privation,\" meant. \n \n \"You think so, dear,\" said the artist, \"because you do not know the meaning of poverty; but adversity would wither and destroy you as quickly as some hot-house blossom would die when transplanted to regions of ice and snow. No, darling, I am too proud to take you now in my obscurity and poverty. Let us wait until the name I can give you shall be an honor to wear.\" \n \n \"It must be so if you wish it, Leslie,\" she answered, sadly; \"but, oh, how can I bear the long separation when I love you so devotedly?\" \n \n \"It will not be for long, dearest—two or three years at best. The time will pass quickly to you in your happy home, under the devoted care of your Uncle Francis—only you must not permit him to alienate your affections from me, for that I am sure is his present intention.\" \n \n She was silent, resting her head against his supporting arm, and passing her small hand wearily over her brow as if to dispel some gathering mist from her sight. The solemn, mystical sound of the foam-capped waves breaking silently on the shore seemed strangely pathetic to her ears. They had never sounded so sad before. \n \n \"Darling, of what are you thinking?\" he asked, gently. \n \n She started and shivered, lifting her white face up to his with a look that nearly broke his heart, it was so pitifully pathetic. He had never seen anything but happiness on that beautiful face.[Pg 15] Why had he won her love only to plant the thorns of sorrow in that fond and trusting heart? \n \n \"Leslie, dear,\" she said, in a strangely altered voice, \"do you believe in presentiments?\" \n \n He started at the words. \n \n \"Bonnibel,\" he answered, \"I hardly know whether I do or not. It would be very superstitious to believe in such things, would it not? And yet may not a merciful Providence sometimes vouchsafe us warnings of things, as the Scotch say, \u0027beyond our ken\u0027? My darling, why did you ask me that strange question?\" \n \n He took her little trembling hand in his and looked searchingly into her face. \n \n \"Leslie,\" she said, \"I have such a strange feeling. Perhaps you will laugh at it. I should have laughed at it myself two hours ago.\" \n \n \"Tell me, dear,\" he pleaded; \"I will not even smile.\" \n \n She looked up with something like awe shining in her large eyes. \n \n \"Leslie, I can hardly find words to put this strong presentiment in; but I feel that if we part now—like this—that before you win the honors you covet, some terrible bar of fate will come between us and sunder us so widely that we shall never meet again.\" \n \n The low, impressive words fell heavily on his heart, chilling it like ice. How strangely they sounded from his little Bonnibel, who but an hour ago was as gay as a butterfly in the sunshine. Now the very elements of tragedy were in her voice and face. A jealous pang struck him to the heart. \n \n \"Bonnibel,\" he said, quietly, \"do you mean that your uncle would marry you to someone else before I came back to claim you?\" \n \n \"I do not know,\" she said; \"I hardly think my feeling was as clearly defined as that. It was a dim, intangible something I could not fathom, and took no peculiar shape. But he might try to do that, for, oh, Leslie! Uncle Francis is terribly angry with us both.\" \n \n \"I am quite aware of that, my dearest,\" he answered, bitterly. \"But, Bonnibel, this presentiment of yours troubles me. Perhaps I am foolish, but I have always been a half-way believer in these things.\" \n \n \"Leslie, I believe it firmly,\" she said, choking back a sob that rose in her throat; \"Uncle Francis will dig some impassable gulf between us. When we part to-night, it will be forever.\" \n \n Hiding her face on his shoulder she sobbed aloud. Poor little bonny bird! she had been soaring in the blue ether, her fair plumage bathed in sunshine all her life. Now her bright wings were clipped, and she walked in the shadow. \n \n \"My love has only brought you sorrow,\" he said, regretfully. \n \n \"No, no; you must not think so,\" she answered, earnestly. \"It seems to me, Leslie, that I have never fully lived until this summer, when I met and loved you. Life has seemed to have a fuller, deeper meaning; the flowers have been sweeter, the sunshine fairer, the sound of the sea has seemed to have a voice that[Pg 16] spake to me of happiness. If you had gone away from me with your love untold I should have missed something from my life forever. You do not guess what a wealth of love is in my heart, Leslie. It is not your love that brings me sorrow; it is the dreadful, dreadful parting with you!\" \n \n He pressed her hand in silence. A terrible temptation had come to him. He was struggling mutely against it, trying to fight it down in all honor. But love and jealousy fought madly against white-handed honor. \n \n \"If you leave her now, in her beauty and youth,\" whispered jealousy, \"some other man will see that she is fair. She will forget you and wed another.\" \n \n \"Make her your own now,\" whispered love. \n \n He was young and ardent; the warm blood of the South, whose flame burns so hotly, fired his veins. He looked at her sitting there so angelically fair in the beautiful moonlight, and knew that he should never love another as he loved this beautiful, innocent child. If she were lost to his future life what profit could he have in wealth and fame? Love and jealousy conquered. \n \n He drew her to his side with a passionate clasp, longing to hold her there forever. \n \n \"Bonnibel,\" he whispered, \"do not be frightened at what I am going to say. I am afraid that they will marry you to some other while I am gone away. Your uncle may persuade you against your will, may even bring force to bear with you. But there is one way in which we can bridge any gulf they may dig between us, darling. Will you marry me secretly to-night? I can leave you more willingly, then, knowing that no power can keep us apart when I come to claim you.\" \n \n \"Marry you to-night?\" gasped the child. \"How can I do that, Leslie?\" \n \n \"Nothing easier, darling. Only a mile and a half from here is the little fishing village of Brandon. We can take your little skiff and go down, be married by the Methodist minister there, and return in a few hours, and then I can leave you without being haunted by a terrible foreboding of losing you forever. They will think you are asleep in your room at home, and no one will miss you or be the wiser for the precious little secret that we will keep sacredly until I come to claim my little wife. Bonnibel, will you make this great sacrifice for love? It will make our future happiness secure.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" she whispered, without a moment\u0027s thought. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786/51978.html","bookId":1082,"book":{"id":1082,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Darling","description":"简介： The sea, the sea, the open sea; The blue, the fresh, the ever free,chanted the fresh and delicious voice of a young girl walking along the sands of the seashore in the summer sunshine at Cape May....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:20 AM"}}
