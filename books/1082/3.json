{"id":29035,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III.","content":"Mr. Arnold and his family, consisting only of his wife and step-daughter, Felise Herbert, were in their places at the table before Bonnibel came floating in, a vision of rosy, innocent loveliness. If she had been beautiful before in her plain blue walking-dress she was doubly so now in her soft white robe of India muslin, with fleecy trimmings of rich Valenciennes lace. A pale blue sash was knotted about her slender waist, and clusters of fragrant blue violets looped back her long golden curls. A golden chain and a cross studded with pearls was clasped about her white neck, though she scarcely needed such adornment. Her beauty was a crown in itself. She came in a little shyly, and blushing very much, for she expected to see her lover, and she glanced under her long lashes along the length of the table as she took her place, expecting to meet his adoring gaze. He was not there. The young girl scarcely knew what to think. She glanced at her uncle as if to enlighten herself. He was not looking at her; indeed, he seemed to avoid her glance purposely, and a moody frown was fixed upon his brow. Her aunt vouchsafed her a cold, unmeaning stare, and Felise Herbert\u0027s large black eyes dilated as she looked at Bonnibel as if with gratified malice. These two ladies, mother and daughter, deserve more than a[Pg 10] passing mention at our hands. We will briefly describe them. Mrs. Arnold was a fine-looking brunette of about forty-five, and would have been rather handsome but for a settled expression of peevishness and discontent that rested upon her features. She was elaborately dressed in a soft summer silk of silver-gray trimmed in black lace, and wore very rich cameo jewelry. Miss Herbert was a younger and handsomer copy of her mother. She was tall and well-formed, with quite regular features, large black eyes, and silky braids of black hair. She was about twenty-five years old, and was becomingly dressed in a thin black grenadine, richly trimmed with satin of the color of old gold. Her ornaments were necklace, earrings, and bracelets of gold. Mr. Arnold could not complain of the beauty of his household, though his tastes in that particular were extremely refined. \"Bonnibel,\" he said, when the dinner which had been discussed in most unusual silence was over, \"come with me into the library. I have something to say to you.\" Bonnibel linked her arm fondly in his and they passed out together. Miss Herbert looked at her mother, and a glance of great significance passed between them, the expression of discontent on the elder lady\u0027s features now deepening to positive anger and hatred. \"Yes,\" she said, as if answering her daughter\u0027s look; \"go and hear what he has to say to the little witch!\" Miss Herbert arose and passed out of the room with soft, subdued footfalls. Mrs. Arnold paced the floor restlessly, clenching her white hands angrily. \"My clever, beautiful Felise,\" she murmured. \"How my husband slights, and ignores her to lavish his whole affection upon that little hateful, yellow-haired child! After all my scheming to get him to love Felise, and at least divide his fortune between them, he boldly declared this evening to that young artist-fool that he would make Bonnibel his heiress. And Felise—she will have nothing but what I can give her out of my portion! which he will make as small as possible in order to enrich his idol. It is too bad—too bad! Something must be done to induce him to change his mind. I wish she would elope with Leslie Dane. That would alienate my husband from her forever.\" The entrance of the servants to clear the table interrupted her. She left the room, with its glitter of lights and glass, silver and flowers, and hurried away to her own luxurious apartments to nurse her wrath and jealousy in solitude. She hated Bonnibel Vere, and she hated her husband. He had married her twenty years ago, when she had palmed herself off upon him as a widow of high family and small means, while in reality she was a vulgar and penniless adventuress, having but one pure affection in her heart, and that her blind, idolatrous love for her spoiled and wayward little daughter. Francis Arnold had discovered the cheat practiced on him long[Pg 11] ago, and though too proud to proclaim the secret to the world, the love he had felt for his handsome wife had changed into quiet contempt that stung her more than the loudest upbraidings. Her daughter, who was treacherous as a cat and vindictive as a snake, he simply hated, and no blandishments or persuasions could induce him to settle anything upon her, though the one object of the mother\u0027s heart was to secure his whole fortune for herself and Felise. We will pause in our contemplation of the ambitious woman\u0027s rage and follow Bonnibel and her uncle to the large, well-lighted, and elegant library. \"Uncle,\" said the girl, going up to him as he sank into his easy-chair, and laying her hand caressingly on his cheek, \"are you not well? You seem so strange, you do not smile on your little girl as usual.\" He was silent a moment as if struggling for words in which to express his grievance, then he broke out impetuously: \"I am sick, little one, sick at heart. I have received a dreadful blow this evening—one that fairly stunned me!\" \"Dear uncle,\" said she, with innocent unconsciousness, \"who was it that dared to wound you so?\" \"Bonnibel, it was Leslie Dane, the poor young artist whom I have patronized this summer because I pitied him! Darling, he had the audacious impertinence to ask me for this little hand!\" he lifted it from his shoulder, where it rested fondly, and pressed it to his lips. But Bonnibel caught it away and started back from his side, her cheeks growing white and her blue eyes dilating. \"What did you say to him?\" she inquired, breathlessly. \"I told him he was a worthless fortune-hunter, and I drove him forth with scorn and contempt,\" said the millionaire hotly. \"You did—you did!\" she cried, horror and incredulity struggling in her voice and face. \"You insulted him thus? Why, Uncle Francis, I love him!\" In those concluding words there was at once a protest and a defiance. It was as if she had felt and said that her love should have been a sufficient shield and protection for him it clung around so fondly. \"Pooh! nonsense!\" said Arnold, trying a light tone of railery; \"you are but a child, Bonnibel, you do not know what love means. Do you think I would suffer you to throw yourself away on that worthless fellow?\" \"He is not worthless,\" she cried out warmly. \"He is noble, good and true, and I love him dearly. But, Uncle Francis,\" she said, suddenly changing her indignant tone to one of gentle entreaty, \"surely you are only jesting and teasing your little girl, and I beg you not to use such dreadful language again, for you insult the man whom I love with my whole heart, and whom I shall one day marry.\" \"Never! never!\" he shouted madly. \"Girl, you have been spoiled and indulged until you are silly enough to cry for the moon and expect me to pluck it from heaven for you! But I[Pg 12] will save you from your folly this time. I will never permit you to marry Leslie Dane!\" It was the first time he had ever denied her anything in the course of her happy, care-free life. And now his cruel and resolute refusal of this new toy she wanted so much, absolutely stunned her and deprived her of speech. She sank into a chair helplessly, and looked at him with parted, tremulous lips, and with wild, astonished blue eyes. He saw how shocked and incredulous she was, and altering his tone, began to explain and argue with her: \"My darling, Leslie Dane is no match for my little girl. He is poor and has nothing to recommend him but a handsome face, and a little talent for daubing with paints and pencils, while you are a beauty and an heiress, and can boast a proud descent. I have made my will, and it is there in my desk this moment. In it I have left you everything except one-third of my property, which my widow will legally inherit. Surely my generosity merits the one little return I ask of you. Simply that you will give up Leslie Dane.\" She looked up at him as he offered his costly bribe, and shook her head gravely. \"You have been very kind to me always, uncle, I never knew you could be cruel until now. I thank you for your kind intention, but I will not give up Leslie for such a sordid bribe. Keep your money, and I will keep my love!\" \"I am not giving you the choice, girl,\" he answered, angrily. \"I intend you to have the money whether you want it or not, and I have already said that you shall never marry Leslie Dane.\" \"And I say that I will marry him!\" she cried, springing up in a rage as passionate and unreasoning as his own, her blue eyes blazing with defiance. \"You shall not prevent me! I love him better than any one else on earth, and I will marry him if I repent it every hour of my after life.\" So saying she rushed from the room, and pausing only to catch up a dark shawl and wrap it about her, she sped down the graveled walk on her way to seek her lover. She paused outside the gate, and crouching down, peered anxiously back to see if she was followed. The moon was up, shining brilliantly over everything. She saw her uncle come out on the piazza and drop into his favorite seat. Then the fragrance of a cigar floated out on the warm August air. Bonnibel hurried on down to the shore. Leslie Dane was waiting for her, pacing the sands impatiently in the soft moonlight.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786/51977.html","bookId":1082,"book":{"id":1082,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Darling","description":"简介： The sea, the sea, the open sea; The blue, the fresh, the ever free,chanted the fresh and delicious voice of a young girl walking along the sands of the seashore in the summer sunshine at Cape May....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:20 AM"}}
