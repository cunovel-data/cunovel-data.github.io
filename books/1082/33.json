{"id":29065,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII.","content":"Within the gloomy cell of a French prison Leslie Dane was seated on a low cot-bed, looking out through the narrow, grated window at the blue and sunny sky of France. The young artist looked haggard and wan in the clear light of the pleasant day, for though it was winter the rigors of that season had not yet set in. His dark eyes had a look of suffering and despair in their beautiful depths, and his lips were set in a weary line of pain. It was the day after his incarceration, and he had spent a wretched, sleepless night, almost maddened by the horror of his fearful situation. Suddenly the heavy key turned in the iron door; it swung open to admit a visitor, and then the jailer closed and re-locked it, shutting into the gloomy cell the blonde face of Carl Muller. \"Bon jour,\" he said, with his debonair smile that seemed to light the gloomy place like a beam of sunshine. \"How goes it, mon ami?\" A gleam of pleasure shone faintly over his friend\u0027s haggard features. [Pg 110] \"Is it you, Carl?\" he said; \"I thought you had deserted me!\" \"Ingrate, could you think it?\" responded Carl. \"I was busy yesterday trying to find out some particulars of this mysterious affair, and they would not admit me last night. I came this morning as soon as they would let me in.\" \"Thanks Carl; I might have known you were true as steel. And yet there is so much falsity and treachery on earth, how could I be sure of your loyalty? Have you learned anything?\" \"Your accuser is the American, Colonel Carlyle,\" was the startling reply. \"My God!\" exclaimed Leslie Dane, with a violent start; and then he added in a passionate tone, and half to himself: \"Has he not already wronged me beyond all forgiveness?\" \"He seems to have pushed it forward with the greatest malignity,\" continued Carl. \"There are other countrymen of yours here in this city who declare they knew of the foul charge against you, yet they say that the verdict against you was given on purely circumstantial evidence, and that, such being the case, they did not intend to molest you, believing that you might after all be innocent of the crime. But Colonel Carlyle has pushed the affair in a way that seems to indicate a personal spite against you.\" Leslie\u0027s broad, white brow clouded over gloomily. \"It is true, then, that there is such a charge against me. I fancied there must be some mistake. The whole affair seemed too monstrous for belief, yet you say it is a stern fact. It is so inexplicable to me, for I swear to you, Carl, that up to the very moment of my arrest yesterday I did not know that Francis Arnold was dead.\" \"And I believe you, Leslie, as firmly as I believe in the purity of my mother away off in my beloved Germany. I know you never could have been guilty of such a foul crime.\" \"A thousand thanks for your noble confidence, Carl. Now I know that I have at least one true friend on earth. I was rather cynical in such matters before. A sad experience had taught me to distrust everyone,\" exclaimed Leslie, as he warmly grasped the young German\u0027s hand. \"But what reason do they assign for my alleged commission of the crime?\" \"They told me,\" said Carl, hesitatingly, \"that you were poor and unknown, and aspired to the hand of the millionaire\u0027s beautiful and high-born niece. Mr. Arnold, they said, declined your suit for the young lady\u0027s hand, and you became enraged and left him, uttering very abusive language coupled with threats of violence. He was murdered while sleeping in his arm-chair that night on his piazza, and it was supposed that you had stealthily returned and wreaked your vengeance upon him.\" \"My God!\" said Leslie Dane, \"they have made out a black case against me, indeed. But upon whose circumstantial evidence was my conviction based?\" \"Mrs. Arnold, the wife of the murdered man, and his step-daughter, Miss Herbert, heard and witnessed the altercation from their drawing-room windows. Their evidence convicted you, it is said.\" [Pg 111] \"My soul!\" exclaimed the unhappy prisoner to himself. \"Bonnibel was there; she at least knew my innocence, yet she spoke no word to clear me from that most foul aspersion! And yet I could have sworn that she loved me as her own life. Oh, God! She was falser than I could have dreamed. But, oh, that angel face; those beguiling lips—how can they cover a heart so black?\" \"Come, come, mon ami, don\u0027t give up like this,\" said Carl, distressed by the sight of his friend\u0027s uncontrollable emotion. \"It is a monstrous thing, I know, and will involve no end of time and worry before you get clear, of course, but, then, there is no doubt of your getting off—you have only to prove your innocence, and you can easily do that, you know. So let\u0027s take it as a joke, and bear it bravely. Do you know I mean to cross the ocean with you, and see the farce played out to the end? Then you shall take me around, and do the honors of your native land.\" Leslie looked at the bright, buoyant face of the German artist as he spoke so cheerily, and a suspicious moisture crept into his dark eyes. He dashed his hand across them, deeming it unmanly weakness. \"Oh! Carl,\" he exclaimed, remorsefully, \"how little I have valued your friendship, yet how firm and noble it has proved itself in this dark and trying hour! Forgive me, my friend, and believe me when I say that I give you the sole affection and trust of a heart that heretofore has trusted nothing of human kind, so basely had it been deceived. I thank, I bless you for that promise to stand by me in my trial! And now I will do what I should have done long ago if I had known the value of your noble heart. I will tell you my story, and you shall be my judge.\" Word for word, though it gave him inexpressible pain to recall it, he went over the story of his love for Bonnibel Vere, and her uncle\u0027s rejection of his suit, and the high words that passed between them. He passed lightly over their farewell, omitting but one thing. It was the story of their moonlight sail and secret marriage. That story was sealed within his breast. He would have died before he would have revealed Bonnibel\u0027s fatal secret to any living soul. \"I left Cape May, where they were summering, on the midnight train,\" he concluded, \"and the next day I sailed from New York for Europe. I never heard from Francis Arnold or his niece again. She had promised to be faithful to our love, but though I wrote to her many times I never received one line in return until that fatal note which you remember. In it she wrote me that she loved another.\" \"Perfidious creature!\" muttered Carl. \"I never heard of her again,\" continued Leslie, \"until, to my unutterable surprise, I met her as the wife of Colonel Carlyle.\" \"And it is for one so false and cruel that you rest under this dreadful charge,\" exclaimed the German. \"But, please God, you will soon be cleared from it. Of course you will have no difficulty in proving an alibi. That is all you need to clear you.\" But Leslie did not answer, and his friend saw that he was pale as death. [Pg 112] \"Of course you can prove an alibi—cannot you, Leslie?\" he asked, with a shade of anxiety in his tone. But Leslie looked at him with a gleam of horror in his dark eyes, and his voice shook with emotion as he answered: \"No, Carl, I cannot!\" Carl Muller started as though a bullet had struck him. \"Leslie you jest,\" he exclaimed, hoarsely. \"Of course you can prove where you were at that exact time when the murder took place. Your safety all hinges upon that. Do you not remember where you were at that time?\" \"Ah, Heaven, do I not remember? Every moment of that time is indelibly stamped upon my memory,\" groaned the unhappy prisoner. \"Then why do you talk so wildly, my dear fellow? All you have to do is to tell where you were at that time, and produce even one competent witness to prove it.\" \"I cannot do it!\" Leslie answered, gravely. \"But, good Heavens, man, your life may have to pay the forfeit if you fail to establish an alibi at the trial.\" \"I must pay the forfeit, then. Carl, I choose death rather than the only available alternative,\" was the inscrutable and final reply.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786/52007.html","bookId":1082,"book":{"id":1082,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Darling","description":"简介： The sea, the sea, the open sea; The blue, the fresh, the ever free,chanted the fresh and delicious voice of a young girl walking along the sands of the seashore in the summer sunshine at Cape May....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:20 AM"}}
