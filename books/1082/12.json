{"id":29044,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII.","content":"\"No, don\u0027t attempt to excuse yourself, mother! If you had taken my advice, and turned your wax doll out upon the world to look out for herself, this would never have happened! But no, you must saddle yourself with the charge of her, and pamper her as foolishly as her uncle did! And now you see the result of your blind folly. It needed but one sight of her baby-face by that old dotard to ruin my prospects for life. I hope you are satisfied with your work!\" It was ten o\u0027clock at night, and Felise Herbert had come into her mother\u0027s room in her dressing-gown, with her dark hair hanging over her shoulders, and her eyes flashing angrily, to upbraid her mother for her weakness in the matter of Bonnibel Vere. \"You should have turned her adrift upon the world,\" she repeated, stamping her slippered foot angrily. \"She might have starved to death for all I cared! After all I did for you, I think you could have done that much to please me!\" \"But, Felise, you know it was quite impossible to take such extreme measures without incurring the censure of the world, and perhaps its suspicion!\" said Mrs. Arnold, deprecatingly. \"Who cares for suspicion—they could not prove anything!\" said Felise, snapping her fingers. \"No, perhaps not,\" Mrs. Arnold answered, \"but all the same, I should not like to run the risk. You are blinded by anger,[Pg 41] Felise; or you would reason more clearly. You know I did not want to keep the girl here. I hate her as much as you do. I have hated her ever since she was born, but you know I dare not turn her off. Society would taboo us if we dared hint such a thing. Turn a girl of her aristocratic antecedents out upon the world to earn her living, while I am rolling in wealth! A girl who knows no more of the world than a baby! The daughter of General Vere, the niece of my dead husband! Felise, you must see that it would never do!\" \"It would if I had been suffered to have my way,\" answered the girl, marching angrily up and down the floor. \"To be thwarted this way in my prospect of making the most brilliant match of the season is too bad! It is shameful! For her to step into my place this way makes me hate her worse than ever!\" \"But, Felise, she cannot step into your place, my dear. Did you not tell me you had learned from Leslie Dane\u0027s intercepted letters that the girl was secretly married to him? Why did you meddle with their correspondence, anyway? Why not have let him come back in time to claim her? She would then have been out of your way!\" \"Mother, you talk like a fool!\" exclaimed the daughter, angrily. \"You know I dare not let Leslie Dane return here! I am compelled to keep him out of the country for the sake of my own safety. I am compelled to separate the two because he must not hear of the charge of murder that we made against him. If she should hear it, as she is likely to do at any time, and should communicate it to him, what would be the consequence? He would return here and disprove the charge at once. Bonnibel was with him that night. They went to Brandon and were married while your husband was being mur—— put out of the way. He could prove an alibi at once. You talk of suspicion—where would suspicion fall then?\" \"Surely not on us, Felise!\" said Mrs. Arnold, fearfully. \"And why not?\" sneered the girl. \"If the now quiescent subject were agitated again what absurd theories might not be propounded by the suspicious world? Who can tell whether Wild Madge could keep the secret? I tell you I have only consulted our vital interests in separating Leslie Dane and Bonnibel Vere, though to do so I have had to destroy my every prospect of becoming the millionaire\u0027s wife. I am compelled to keep that beggarly artist out of the country at any cost.\" \"But, my dear, there is no chance of Bonnibel marrying Colonel Carlyle even though she should be separated forever from her artist-husband, for she is a married woman anyhow. One hint of this to Colonel Carlyle would make your affair all right with him again!\" \"It would not,\" answered Felise, passionately. \"He is madly in love with her. Have I not seen it in these few weeks since she has been well enough to come down-stairs? Has not the old fool hung over her as dotingly as any boy-lover could do? Suppose I told him the truth? Do you think he would return to me? No, he would only hate me because I had shattered his brilliant air castle!\" [Pg 42] \"I am surprised that Bonnibel tolerates his attentions as she does,\" said Mrs. Arnold, stirring up the fire that was beginning to burn low in the grate. \"She does not suspect what the old fox is after; I will do her that much justice,\" said Felise, bitterly. \"He is very cautious. He has a thousand tales of her father\u0027s prowess with which to pave his way and awaken her interest. She makes an idol of her wretched father who squandered every penny of her mother\u0027s fortune, and only redeemed himself by dying recklessly in some foolish charge on the battle-field!\" She resumed her walk up and down the floor which she had temporarily ceased during the last outburst. She was furiously angry. Her eyes blazed luridly, her lips were curled back from her glittering teeth, her step seemed to spurn the floor. Her mother watched her uneasily. \"Felise, do you not fret yourself, my dear. I am persuaded that everything will come right soon. Suppose Colonel Carlyle is in love with Bonnibel. If he proposes to her she is compelled to refuse his offer. What more natural than that he should return to you then, and make you his wife. Hearts are often caught on the rebound, you know.\" \"Mother, hush! You talk like a simpleton as you are!\" was the fierce retort. Mrs. Arnold was stung to anger by the unprovoked insolence of her daughter. She rose and looked at her in dignified displeasure. \"Felise,\" she said, threateningly, \"you are my daughter, but you must not suppose that I will tamely bear the continued disrespect and contumely I have lately been forced to receive at your hands. In your rage at losing Colonel Carlyle you seem to forget that it is in my power to make you almost as wealthy as he could do. Remember, I am a very rich woman, and I can leave my wealth to whom I please.\" \"And who placed you in that position?\" sneered Felise. \"How much would you have been worth but for my constant care of your interests? A third of your husband\u0027s property, which was all you could legally claim! That was what he said to his big wax-doll. The balance of his money was for her, to make her a queen and win the homage of the world for her. Perhaps you will leave her the money I have risked so much to gain for you?\" \"Felise, this is but idle recrimination. You know I would not leave Bonnibel Vere a penny to save her soul from perdition, and you know I have been scheming all my life to get that money for you, and that I will certainly give it to you. But I do not understand your mood to-night. What is it that you wish me to do?\" \"Nothing, nothing! Months ago I begged you to send the girl away and you refused me. You knew I hated her, and you knew I spared nothing that came in my way. She has come between me and my dearest ambition. Now let her look to herself. I tell you, mother, I will take a terrible revenge on Bonnibel Vere for what I have lost. I have sworn it, and I will surely keep my vow!\" [Pg 43] She stood still a moment with upraised hands, looking fixedly at her mother, then she turned and went swiftly from the room. Mrs. Arnold stared after her blankly. She was a cruel and wicked woman, but she would not have dared to go such lengths as her daughter. She was afraid of her daughter, and frightened at the terrible intent expressed in her tone and manner. \"My God!\" she murmured, with a shiver, \"what rash act is she about to commit?\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786/51986.html","bookId":1082,"book":{"id":1082,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Darling","description":"简介： The sea, the sea, the open sea; The blue, the fresh, the ever free,chanted the fresh and delicious voice of a young girl walking along the sands of the seashore in the summer sunshine at Cape May....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:20 AM"}}
