{"id":29066,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV.","content":"\"Words fail me, Colonel Carlyle, when I try to express my burning sense of your injustice in this high-handed outrage! What, in this enlightened age, in this nineteenth century, do men turn palaces into prisons, and debar weak women of their liberties? Am I a slave that you have turned your keys upon me, and set hirelings and slaves to watch me? Am I a criminal? If so, where is my crime?\" \n \n A long and elegant saloon in a beautiful palace in Italy. The rich curtains of silk and lace are looped back from the windows, and the view outside is the beautiful Bay of Naples with the clear, blue, sunny sky reflected in its blue and sparkling waves. A garden lies below the windows, rich, in this tropical clime, with beautiful flowers, and vines and shrubbery, while groves of oranges, lemons, figs and dates abound in lavish luxuriance. Within the room that was furnished with princely magnificence and taste, were a man and a woman, the man old, and bowed, and broken, the woman young and more beautiful than it often falls to the lot of women to be. Her delicate features, chiseled with the rare perfection of a head carved in cameo, were flushed with passion, and the glow of anger shone through the pure, transparent skin, tinting it with an unusual bloom. As she walked restlessly up and down the room, in her trailing robe of soft azure hue, her sea-blue eyes blazed under their drooping lashes until they looked black with excitement. \n \n \"I tell you,\" she said, pausing a moment, as no answer came to her passionate outburst, and facing the man before her with a slim, uplifted finger, as if in menace, \"I tell you, Colonel Carlyle, that the vengeance of Heaven will fall upon you for this[Pg 113] cruel, unmanly deed! Oh, how can you forget your sense of honor as a soldier and a gentleman, and descend to an act so ignoble and unworthy? To imprison a weak and helpless woman, who has no friend or defender save Heaven! Oh, for shame, for shame!\" \n \n His eyes fell before the unbearable scorn in hers, and he turned as if to leave the room. But half way to the door he paused and came back to her. \n \n \"Bonnibel,\" he said, sternly, \"cease this wild raving, and calm yourself. My troubles are hard enough to bear without the additional weight of unmerited reproaches from you. I am of all men the most miserable.\" \n \n She shook off the hand with which he attempted to lead her to a seat, as if there had been contagion in the mere contact of his white, aristocratic fingers. \n \n \"No, do not touch me!\" she exclaimed, wildly. \"At least spare me that indignity. All other relations that have existed between us are altered now, and merged simply into this—I am your prisoner, and you are my jailer. The eagle spurns the hand of its captor. Remember, there is proud, untamable blood in my veins that will not be subdued. I am Harry Vere\u0027s daughter.\" \n \n Bonnibel saw him wince as the name of her beloved father passed her lips. \n \n \"Ah, you are not lost to all sense of shame,\" she cried. \"You can tremble at the name of the hero you have wronged through his helpless daughter! Oh, Colonel Carlyle, by the memory of my father, whom you pretended to love and honor, I beg you to let me go free from this place.\" \n \n Her angry recklessness had broken down suddenly into pathetic pleading. Her slender hands were locked together, her eyes were lifted to his with great, raining tears shining in them. He turned half away, trembling in spite of his iron will at sight of those tearful eyes, and parted, quivering lips. \n \n \"Bonnibel,\" he answered, in a voice of repressed emotion, \"my suffering at the course I have found myself compelled to pursue with you is greater than your own. I love you with all the strength of a man\u0027s heart, and yet I am almost compelled to believe you the falsest of women. And yet, through all the distrust and suspicion which your recent conduct has forced me to harbor, the instinct that bids me have faith in the honor of Harry Vere\u0027s daughter is so much beyond the mere power of my reason that at one little promise from your lips you might this moment go free!\" \n \n \"And that promise?\" she asked, dashing the blinding tears away from her eyes and looking into his face. \n \n \"Bonnibel, on the night when I presumed to lock you into your chamber you were about to fly from me—to what fate I know not, but—I feared the worst. Think of the shame, the disgrace, the agony I must have endured from your desertion! Can you wonder that I took stringent measures to prevent you from carrying your wild project into execution? I would have laid you dead at my feet before you should have broken my heart and made me a target for the scorn of the world.\" \n \n [Pg 114] \n \n She did not flinch as he uttered the emphatic words and looked keenly into her face. She thought of herself vaguely as of one lying dead at the feet of that stern, old, white-haired man, yet the passing thought came to her indifferently as to one who was bearing the burden of a \"life more pathetic than death.\" She felt no anger rising within her at the threat. Only a faint, stifled yearning awoke within her for a moment as his stern voice evoked a vision of the rest and peace of the grave. \n \n \"You see how strongly I feel on this subject, my wife,\" he continued, after a long pause, \"yet even now you shall go free if you will give me your sacred word of honor, by the memory of your father, that you will not desert me—that you will not leave me!\" \n \n Silence fell—a long, painful silence. He stood quite still, looking down at her pale face, and waiting for her answer with quickened heart-beats. For her, she seemed transformed to a statue of marble only for the quick throbs that stirred the filmy lace folded over her breast. She stood quite still, her eyes drooping from his, a look of pitiful despair frozen on the deathly pallor of her face. Outside they could hear a soft wind sighing among the flowers and kissing the blue waves of the bay. Within, the fragrance of an orange tree, blooming in a niche, came to them with almost sickening oppressiveness. Still she made no sign of answer. \n \n \"Bonnibel,\" he said, and his hoarse, strained voice fell so unnaturally on the stillness that he started at its strange sound, \"Bonnibel, my darling little wife, you will give me that promise?\" \n \n She shivered through all her frame as if those pleading words had broken her trance of silence. \n \n \"Do not ask me,\" she said, faintly, \"I cannot!\" \n \n \"You will not give me that little promise, Bonnibel?\" \n \n \"I cannot,\" she moaned, sinking into a chair and hiding her face in her hands. \n \n \"You are determined to leave me, then, if you can?\" he exclaimed in a voice of blended horror and reproach. \n \n \"I must,\" she reiterated. \n \n \"Then tell me why you must go away, Bonnibel. What is this fatal secret that is driving you forth into exile? This mystery will drive me mad!\" \n \n She removed her hands a moment, and looked up at him with sad, wistful eyes, and a face crimson with painful blushes. \n \n \"Colonel Carlyle, I will tell you this much,\" she said, \"for I see that you suspect me of that which I would rather die than be guilty of. I am not going because a guilty passion for a former lover is driving me from your arms to his. If I go into exile I shall go alone, and I shall pray for death every hour until my weary days upon earth are ended forever. Death is the only happiness I look for, the future holds nothing for me but the blackness of darkness. I can tell you nothing more!\" \n \n She ceased, and dropped her anguished face into the friendly shelter of her hands again. He remained rooted to the spot as if he could never move again. \n \n \"Bonnibel,\" he said, at last, \"surely some subtle madness possesses[Pg 115] you. You do not know what you would do. I must save you from yourself until you become rational again.\" \n \n With these words he went out of the room, locking the door behind him. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786/52008.html","bookId":1082,"book":{"id":1082,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Darling","description":"简介： The sea, the sea, the open sea; The blue, the fresh, the ever free,chanted the fresh and delicious voice of a young girl walking along the sands of the seashore in the summer sunshine at Cape May....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:20 AM"}}
