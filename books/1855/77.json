Missing you is a physical aching that grips me early in the morning and does not leave me, not even as I draw my last waking breath.\n My solace in these waning empty summer days is the knowledge that you’re safe, and alive, and healthy, and that the worst that you have to go through is serfdom for four well-meaning old women.\n The wood piles I’ve left are the lightest in the front. The heaviest ones are for the winter. Use them last, and if you need help carrying them, God help me, ask Vova. Don’t hurt yourself. And don’t fill the water pails all the way to the top. They’re too heavy.\n Getting back was rough, and as soon as I came back, I was sent right out to the Neva, where for six days we planned our attack and then made a move in boats across the river and were completely crushed in two hours. We didn’t stand a chance. The Germans bombed the boats with the Vanyushas, their version of my rocket launcher, the boats all sank. We were left with a thousand fewer men and were no closer to crossing the river. We’re now looking at other places we can cross. I’m fine, except for the fact that it’s rained here for ten days straight and I’ve been hip deep in mud for all that time. There is nowhere to sleep, except in the mud. We put our trench coats down and hope it stops raining soon. All black and wet, I almost felt sorry for myself until I thought of you during the blockade.\n I’ve decided to do that from now on. Every time I think I have it so tough, I’m going to think of you burying your sister in Lake Ladoga.\n I wish you had been given a lighter cross than Leningrad to carry through your life.\n Things are going to be relatively quiet here for the next few weeks, until we regroup. Yesterday a bomb fell in the commandant’s bunker. The commandant wasn’t there at the time. Yet the anxiety doesn’t go away. When is it going to come again?\n I play cards and soccer. And I smoke. And I think of you.\n I sent you money. Go to Molotov at the end of August.\n Don’t forget to eat well, my warm bun, my midnight sun, and kiss your hand for me, right in the palm and then press it against your heart.\n Alexander\n Tatiana read Alexander’s letter a hundred times, memorizing every word. She slept with her face on the letter, which renewed her strength.\n My love, my dear, dear Shura,\n Don’t talk about my cross — first heave your own off your shoulders.\n How did I live last winter? I don’t know, but I think almost longingly of it now. Because I moved. There was movement inside me. I had energy to lie, to pretend to Dasha, to keep her alive. I walked, I was with Mama, I was too busy to die myself. Too busy hiding my love for you.\n But now I wake up and think, how am I going to go through the rest of my day until sleep?\n To ease myself back into life, I’ve surrounded myself with the villagers. You think it was bad before. I’m from morning till night helping Irina Persikova, who had to have her leg cut off in Molotov, infection or something. I think I like her because she carries my mother’s name.\n I think of Dasha. I grieve for my sister.\n But her face is not the last face I see before I sleep. Yours is.\n You are my hand grenade, my artillery fire. You have replaced my heart with yourself.\n Are you thinking of me with your rifle in your hands?\n What do we do? How do we keep you from dying? These thoughts consume my waking minutes. What can I do from here to keep you alive?\n Dead or wounded, those Soviets will leave you in the field.\n Who is going to heal you if you fall?\n Who is going to bury you if you die? Bury you like you deserve — with kings and heroes.\n Yours,\n Tatiana\n Tatia,\n You ask how I keep myself from dying. Poorly, I say. Though still better than Ivan Petrenko.\n My commander tells me — choose the best men you have, and I salute him, and do. And then they die. What does that make me?\n We came under the worst unprotected fire today. I can’t believe I’m alive to write you these words. We were supplying the men across the river at the Nevsky Patch. We row the boats with food and arms and munitions and new men to the other side. But the Germans are relentless from Sinyavino Heights, we can’t get past them or to them; they sit on their hills like vultures and hurl their metal at us. Usually I don’t go — there’s not enough of me to go on these suicide missions, and the commander knows it, but today we just didn’t have enough soldiers to man the boats.\n Petrenko died. We were in the boat coming back to our side, and a piece of artillery shell hit him. Took his arm off. I threw him on my back, and, you know, in my insanity I bent down to pick up his arm. I picked it up and he fell off my back, and as I looked at him lying in the boat I thought, what am I doing? Who is going to sew that arm back on?\n I didn’t want him and his arm reunited, I realized. I just wanted them to be buried together. There is no dignity in the man being ripped apart. The body has to be together so the soul can find it. I buried him and his arm by the woods, near a small birch. He had once said he liked birches. Had to take his rifle — we barely have enough weapons as it is — but I left him his helmet.\n I liked him. Where is the justice that a good man like Petrenko dies and yet Dimitri, infirm and hobbled, still lives?\n You want to know what I thought of in that boat?\n I thought, I have to stay alive. Tatiasha will never forgive me.\n But this war is unjust, as you’ve seen. A good man has as much chance of dying as a bad one. Maybe more so.\n I want you to know that should something happen to me, don’t worry about my body. My soul isn’t going to return to it, nor to God. It’s flying straight to you, where it knows it can find you, in Lazarevo. I want to be neither with kings nor heroes, but with the queen of Lake Ilmen.\n Alexander \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bronze-horseman-the-bronze-horseman-1/page-77.html","bookId":1855,"book":{"id":1855,"title":"The Bronze Horseman (The Bronze Horseman #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Called “a Russian Thorn Birds,” The Bronze Horseman by Paullina Simons is a sweeping saga of love and war that has been a monumental bestseller all over the world.
