Chapter Sixteen On the Road The drive down to the country road was tense, but uneventful. If the zombies were still pursuing them, they were now far behind the ATV and its trailer. Eric maneuvered the vehicle onto the paved road the dirt one dead-ended onto. The smooth surface was a relief to their weary joints. Stacey glanced back to make sure her brother was still okay. Sean was asleep and Eric worried about how much blood he had lost. There was no way they could go to a hospital or clinic. \"He looks pale,\" Stacey decided. \"He lost a lot of blood. He needs to rest,\" Eric answered. He wasn\u0027t sure if this was true or not, but it sounded right. The narrow road was completely clear of vehicles and Eric shifted gears and let the vehicle idle. He climbed off and headed to the trailer for his map. Sean stirred a little and blinked his eyes. \"We there?\" Eric shook his head. \"No. Not yet.\" \"Where are we going again?\" Sean sat up slowly. He looked pale and maybe a little dehydrated. \"A construction site they are making into a fort.\" Eric opened up the map and began to look over the route he had highlighted in yellow maker days before. \"Did you tell me that?\" \"No, he didn\u0027t,\" Stacey said to her brother and forced him to lay back down. \"Okay. \u0027cause I was feeling a little hazy there,\" Sean confessed. Stacey touched his brow and frowned a little. \"I think you need some water.\" \"Painkillers would be good. Seriously. Got anything in that first aid kit?\" As Stacey pulled out the tin box again and began rummaging through it, Eric slid Pepe out of his jacket and placed him on the ground. The little dog had been sleeping and looked up at him groggily. \"Do your business,\" Eric ordered him and looked at the map once more. Pepe, obviously feeling cranky about being awakened, lifted his leg and tinkled right where he stood. \"Cut dog,\" Stacey said and actually smiled. \"What\u0027s his name?\" \"Pepe.\" Eric looked down at the dog. The little guy flopped down on the ground and yawned. \"And I\u0027m Eric. I don\u0027t think I said that before.\" \"If you did, I forgot,\" Stacey answered truthfully. \"I\u0027m Sean. That\u0027s my twin sister, Stacey,\" Sean said and sounded a little out of it. \"Wish we could have met under better circumstances.\" Eric rummaged under the tarp and pulled out a warm bottle of water and handed it to Sean. \"I usually try and treat company much better than this.\" Sean laughed: the sound thick and a little pained. \"Yeah, well, your hospitality sucks. Seriously, who invites zombies to a dinner party?\" “Ha. Ha, very funny.” Gently, Stacey stroked her brother\u0027s hair. \"Take the aspirin. Drink all the water.\" \"She\u0027s so bossy. Did you notice?\" Sean giggled and gulped the warm water. “Yuck. It’s warm. Where’s the ice?” Ignoring him, Stacey looked toward Eric. \"I need some water, too. I’m parched.\" \"Oh, sure. We probably all do.\" Eric quickly got out two more bottles and poured some into a cap for Pepe after handing one to Stacey. Stacey gulped down her water and then poured the last bit over her reddened face. Her blond bangs hung in her face and her ponytail looked scraggly. \"How far?\" \"Well, if it were a straight shot, we\u0027d be there fairly soon, but there are some towns that I think we should avoid. I have mapped out a very roundabout way to get there to avoid more populated areas. I think we\u0027ll get there close to sunset.\" \"It\u0027s about five now. We need to get to shelter before dark.\" \"How do you know its five?\" Eric noticed she didn\u0027t even look at her watch. \"Position of the sun.\" \"Coop taught us that!\" Sean giggled. Stacey leaned over him and laid her hand on his face again. \"I think he\u0027s delirious.\" \"He lost a lot of blood,\" Eric reminded her once more. Biting her bottom lip, she nodded. \"Yeah. I know.\" Pepe yawned loudly again and leaned against Eric\u0027s leg. Stacey began to rummage around under the tarp, pushing the securing ropes aside and trying not to bother her brother too much. She pulled out the rifle and checked to see if it was loaded. \"Mind if I hold onto this?\" \"Can you handle it?\" \"Coop always took us hunting. She was the best shot,\" Sean said in a drowsy voice and tossed the empty water bottle into the grass beside the road. \"Hey, no littering,\" Stacey chided him and went to retrieve the bottle. \"Like the big bad cops are gonna get me,\" Sean mumbled. \"If you can handle the rifle, take it. I got the revolver and Pepe.\" “Yeah. He’s a tough little guy. Zombies wouldn’t be smart to mess with him,” Stacey said with a grin. She wandered into the grass to find the bottle and Pepe followed her looking quite pleased with her commentary on his prowess. Eric finished looking over the map and tucked it away. He felt he had his bearings now and he fished his small pair of binoculars out of his lightweight jacket. Lifting them, he scanned the area. Nothing stirred in the trees or the tall grass. Birds sang in the trees and the insects hummed around them, but he didn\u0027t see any zombies. \"It looks like we\u0027ll be fine on this road until we turn off on this little road here,\" Eric decided. Stacey returned with the bottle in one hand and Pepe in her arms. The rifle was slung over her shoulder and she looked tired. Now that the adrenaline rush was over, Eric was feeling exhausted, too. But despite his weariness, he knew he had to stay focused on things other than his aching legs from the mad dash earlier and his bleary eyes. Grabbing up one of the extra containers of gas, he turned off the ATV and began to top off the tank. \"We don\u0027t need to run out of gas at the wrong time,\" Eric explained. Stacey nodded and snuggled up Pepe. He licked her cheek and chin happily. Eric was surprised at how easily the dog and the young woman were getting along. Brandy had rarely picked up Pepe. Once he was done fueling up the ATV, he twisted the cap firmly back onto the container and reloaded it onto the trailer. Sean moaned low in his sleep and the sound sent a trickle of fear up Eric\u0027s spine. Stacey\u0027s twin looked comfortable enough, but his color was off. \"Let\u0027s go. Please,” Stacey said. \"Pepe\u0027s ears are up.\" Eric looked toward his dog to see that the little guy was looking around anxiously and sniffing the air. He immediately climbed back onto the ATV and tucked Pepe into his jacket as Stacey slid behind him and grabbed hold of his waist firmly with one arm. The four-wheel drive vehicle surged forward again and it hummed down the paved road dragging the trailer behind it. A half-mile down the road, Eric saw an old woman standing in the middle of the road. \"This doesn\u0027t look right,\" Stacey said loudly into the wind so he could hear her. The woman\u0027s housedress was splattered with bright red designs that Eric suspected was actually blood. \"Don\u0027t slow down. Just go around,\" Stacey urged him. “We can’t risk it!” Eric nodded and made sure to give wide berth to the woman. As they passed her, she reached out her hands to them in silence. She was too far away to snag them and Pepe barked at her once as they passed. Stacey twisted around to look back at the woman. The gray haired old lady just stared after the vehicle with her gnarled hands held out toward them. \"Eric, I think she\u0027s alive.\" After a quick check of his mirrors, Eric had to agree. The old woman would be charging them if she was undead and the big red splotches on her dress looked more like a deliberate design than blood. \"Okay, we\u0027ll head back for her.\" Pepe burst into rapid fire barking and Eric hesitated as he began to pull the ATV about. Abruptly, the old woman dropped her arms and turned slowly toward the tree line. Four zombies rushed out at her and she didn\u0027t even cry out as they tackled her to the ground. Stacey screamed and Eric pulled so hard on the accelerator that they both jerked backwards as the vehicle took off. \"Oh, God. She was alive! She was alive! We killed her!\" Eric grabbed Stacey\u0027s hand firmly and squeezed it. \"Listen to me! Listen to me! We didn\u0027t know!\" Stacey buried her face in his shoulder and sobbed loudly. \"Why won\u0027t it stop? Why won\u0027t it stop, Eric?\" Caressing her fingers, Eric felt at a loss as to what to say. Dread filled him and his stomach clenched as he realized their chance for survival was growing slimmer. \"I don\u0027t know. But we have to keep going. We have to keep trying to get to a safe place.\" Stacey nodded and laid her head against his back. \"I know.\" They lapsed into silence and didn\u0027t speak for some time. At one point, Eric was sure she had fallen asleep against his back. She felt heavy against him, but instead of it bothering him, it comforted him. She was strong and he admired that. But she also trusted him and that touched him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/as-the-world-dies-untold-tales-volume-1/page-16.html","bookId":2484,"book":{"id":2484,"title":"As the World Dies: Untold Tales Volume 1","description":"Storyline: THE FIRST DAYS: AS THE WORLD DIES introduced Jenni and Katie and their harrowing journey to the makeshift fort in the Texas Hill Country.
