One was a surly looking black girl in possibly her late teens and the other was a very effeminate young man. \"Took you bitches long enough,\" the young man decided. \"Ken, behave,\" the girl beside him drawled. \"I\u0027m just kidding, Lenore. Sheesh. Welcome on board the Zombie Rescumobile. I\u0027m Ken and this is my bestest girl, Lenore.\" The girl rolled her eyes. \"Eric and Stacey,\" Eric said as he slid into a seat next to Stacey. \"We just got rescued, too. Though, not as dramatically as you guys. It was like a movie out there,\" Ken said and was obviously impressed. The doors shut behind their rescuers and Eric jumped as several zombies reached the bus and began to bang on the side. There was no way that he and Stacey would have survived. He felt immense relief that they had been rescued and he squeezed Stacey\u0027s hand tighter. \"Katarina, let\u0027s roll,\" Ed ordered the driver. \"You got it,\" she answered and shifted gears. Jenni slid into the seat in front of Eric and Stacey and smiled at them. \"Glad we found you guys. It was a fluke. Katarina took a wrong turn and we saw the big \u0027help\u0027 on the tower.\" Eric sighed with relief and reached out to touch Jenni\u0027s arm. \"You have no idea how grateful we are.\" A shadow passed over Jenni\u0027s expression for a second then she took Eric\u0027s hand and squeezed it. \"I was rescued once. I do know. I\u0027m glad we found you.\" She quickly slid out of the seat again and returned to the front of the bus as it rumbled on down the road leaving the zombies and the water tower behind. Stacey laid her head on Eric\u0027s shoulder and sighed softly. Pepe yawned dramatically and snuggled deeper into his jacket. Feeling relief like he had never experienced before, Eric relaxed and enjoyed the drive to the fort. They were safe at last. The Fort was nothing like Eric had imagined, but it was still wonderful. The makeshift lock system that was under construction that let the vehicles entering and leaving the Fort move through a series of paddocks was clever, but obviously still needing work. When the bus reached the interior of the Fort, Jenni quickly disembarked and leaped onto a tall Hispanic man that was waiting for her. She was carried off in his arms, both of them talking in Spanish, and Eric couldn\u0027t help but smile at their affection. Bill and Felix escorted them along with Lenore and Ken to city hall where they were given a lunch of vegetable soup, fresh cornbread, and jello. Nothing had ever tasted so good to Eric. He was relieved to see Pepe eating some soft dog food and slurping down water. Stacey was quiet and ate quickly, but he could understand her apprehension. They would have died this morning if not for their rescue. They had been so close to the edge of death and now they were safe. It was both a shock and a relief to be at the Fort and they were both trying to adjust. People kept stopping by to say hello and Eric was touched by the warmth and friendliness of the Fort\u0027s inhabitants. It was Peggy that assigned them their new living quarters and had them bumped in line for shower that was in the basement of the janitor\u0027s office in city hall. \"Peggy? It\u0027s me! Eric!\" He had stared at the woman in shock. \"Oh, Lord. I thought you were dead when you never logged back on!\" They had embraced tightly for a few moments and Eric felt tears in his eyes. He was separated from Stacey for awhile. Peggy lead her away to find clothes and take a shower. Eric was lead by Bill to meet with Travis, the architect behind the Fort construction, and Juan, the head of construction. Both of them were excited to hear he was an engineer and shared some of their plans with him. Eric was amazed at how quickly he absorbed what was going on and made a few suggestions that both Travis and Juan were impressed with. Finally, he was able to go take a shower. Nothing had ever felt so wonderful in his life despite the dank surroundings of the janitor’s office and the plumbing banging away in the wall. He dressed in jeans and a T-shirt that Peggy had put aside for him. He had been told a Wal-Mart truck had joined the Fort on the first day and its inventory had helped the Fort significantly. His new clothes were from that stock and he felt awkward in his new Wrangler jeans. It was a far departure from his old khaki pants and button down shirts. It was like moving through a dream as he walked through the construction site that was neatly organized into living areas and work areas. Travis had shown him the plans to go into the hotel looming over the site and he looked over to where they were building a small wall and gate against the back of the hotel. They were going to have to break through the wall to get into the hotel and fear of zombies on the inside had inspired Travis to build a gated entry just in case of trouble. He slipped into his new home; a tent made of blue tarp, and found Stacey lying on a cot with Pepe. They were both sound asleep and he sat across from them on his own cot and watched them. Both were peaceful in their slumber and he felt relieved that they were both safe and with him. Later, he fell asleep and when he awoke, he found Stacey and Pepe gone. By evening he had met the people behind the names he had heard from Peggy. Katie was a warm, generous person with beautiful blond curls and a wide smile. She had met him in the lunch line and he liked her immediately. Travis joined them at their table and they spent most of the time talking about construction. Katie stuck around and Travis seemed pleased with this. Eric wondered if everyone in the Fort was finding connections with each other and he couldn\u0027t really blame them. This new deadly world forced everyone to move on and embrace what they had left in life. He had found himself doing that very thing for the last few weeks. Stacey and Pepe kept appearing in his peripheral vision, but he kept being distracted by Travis, the Mayor, Juan and Peggy. They pulled him into their planning session that afternoon and he loved the feeling of being back at work and part of the greater picture. The sun was setting when he finally made it back to the tent. Stacey and Pepe were not there and he felt lonely without them. Sitting on the cot, he took a deep breath and let it out slowly. In one short day, his whole world had changed again. He was safe in the Fort. Pepe was going to be okay. Stacey was still alive. They had made it. But he felt lonely without them near him and he sat in silence in the blue tent that was bigger, but just as makeshift as the old one on the water tower. \"You\u0027re popular,\" Stacey said from the entry. She stepped in and let the flap fall back behind her. Pepe bounced over to Eric and wagged his tail. Already he looked so much better. \"They\u0027re picking my brain for the construction of the Fort defenses,\" he answered her as he plucked Pepe off the ground to pet him. She looked at him with an expression that was hard to fathom. Dressed in a white summer dress, her short straight hair falling to her shoulders, she looked pretty, fresh, and young. She folded her arms over her breasts and sighed a little. \"Is something wrong?\" She shrugged her bony shoulders and then shook her head. \"I\u0027m glad to be here, but it feels weird now.\" \"Weird?\" He looked up at her curiously, but he thought he understood. \"It was just us out there. You, me, Pepe. We felt like a little family or something. But here…\" Eric set Pepe aside and stood up. \"Stacey…\" \"Look, I know I\u0027m like six years younger than you. I probably seem very stupid and young compared to Brandy. And I know you were taking care of me because you\u0027re a good guy. You don\u0027t have to share-\" He kissed her. Startled, she stopped talking then wrapped her arms around his neck. They clung to each other for a long moment and when they parted they were both crying. \"Why didn\u0027t you do that before,\" she asked softly. \"I didn\u0027t want you to think I was doing it because we were going to die,\" Eric admitted. Stacey laughed at this then wiped her tears away. \"Well, you did promise me we wouldn\u0027t die. And you were right.\" Eric stroked her hair gently then said, \"I promise I won\u0027t leave you.\" She looked up at him through her tawny eyelashes and smiled slowly. \"Promise.\" Eric laughed and kissed her lips again. \"I promise.\" Pepe whined at their feet and Stacey stooped and picked him up. Eric wrapped his arms around both of them as Pepe squirmed around trying to lick them both at the same time. As the sounds of construction continued around them, the chatter of voices wafted on the evening breeze, and the distant sound of thunder rumbled, they looked at each other, smiled, and knew they were finally home.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/as-the-world-dies-untold-tales-volume-1/page-23.html","bookId":2484,"book":{"id":2484,"title":"As the World Dies: Untold Tales Volume 1","description":"Storyline: THE FIRST DAYS: AS THE WORLD DIES introduced Jenni and Katie and their harrowing journey to the makeshift fort in the Texas Hill Country.
