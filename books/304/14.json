{"id":33161,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. CLARA MANTON.","content":"James Cromwell did not remain at the Madison Hotel, but secured board for himself and Robert at a private house in the village, where the only other boarders were a gentleman and his daughter. The latter was about nineteen, passably pretty, and very fond of attention. Her name was Clara Manton. Her father was in ill-health, and for a year or two had been out of business. He was possessed of about fifteen thousand dollars, well invested, and the income of this sum in a place like Madison, yielded him and his daughter a very comfortable support. When Clara Manton heard that they were to have two fellow-boarders, and that one of them was a young man, she determined, as she expressed it to her friend, Louisa Bates, \"to set her cap for him.\" \"Would you marry him?\" inquired Louisa, of her friend. [Pg 108] \"As to that, I can\u0027t tell. I haven\u0027t seen him yet. He may be very disagreeable for all I know. But even if he is, I am going to flatter him up, and make him fall in love with me. Then, when he offers himself, I can take his case into consideration.\" \"Perhaps you\u0027ll fall in love yourself, Clara,\" suggested her friend. \"I am not very susceptible. I wouldn\u0027t marry a masculine angel, unless he had some money. I must find out how Mr. Cromwell stands in that way, first.\" When James Cromwell first made his appearance at Mrs. Shelby\u0027s table, Clara Manton, who sat opposite, fixed her black eyes upon his face, and examined him attentively. As James Cromwell\u0027s personal appearance has previously been described, it will readily be believed that Clara was not fascinated with the retreating forehead, ferret-like eyes, mottled complexion and insignificant features. \"He\u0027s horrid ugly!\" she said to herself. \"I don\u0027t think I ever saw a homelier man. The boy is much better looking. I wish he were the young man. There\u0027d be some satisfaction in exercising my fascinations upon him. However, beauty is[Pg 109] only skin deep, and if Mr. Cromwell has got money, I don\u0027t know that I would object to marrying him. What I want is a nice house and an easy life.\" It will be seen that Clara Manton was not one of the romantic girls of which heroines are usually made. In truth, she was incapable of any love, except self-love, and though she could counterfeit sentiment, she had none of the quality. She was very practical and calculating, and did not mean to surrender her freedom, unless she could obtain the substantial advantages which she desired. In spite, therefore, of James Cromwell\u0027s personal deficiencies, she determined to exercise her arts upon him. On sitting down to the table she was introduced by Mrs. Shelby. \"How do you like Madison, Mr. Cromwell?\" she said, with great suavity. \"Pretty well, thank you,\" said Cromwell, rather awkwardly, for he always felt uncomfortable in the society of ladies, particularly if they were young, or in any way pretty or attractive. It might have been a vague idea of his own personal disadvantages that produced this feeling, but it was partly because he had had very limited [Pg 110]opportunities of becoming acquainted or associating with the opposite sex. \"I am glad you like us well enough to establish yourself here,\" said the young lady, graciously. \"I hear you have gone into business in the village, so that we may hope to have you as a permanent accession to our village society.\" \"Thank you, Miss Manton,\" said James Cromwell, trying to think of something more to say, but not succeeding. \"Do you go back to the store in the evening?\" asked the young lady, as he rose from the table. \"Yes, I think so. I am expected to keep open in the evening.\" \"But you have an assistant?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then I advise you not to make yourself a slave to business. We shall hope for the pleasure of your company occasionally in the evening.\" James Cromwell felt flattered, and looking full in the young lady\u0027s face, he thought to himself, \"She is very pretty, and she seems to show me a great deal of politeness.\" \"Thank you, Miss Manton, for your kind invitation. I will accept it very soon—as soon as I think I can be spared from my business.\" [Pg 111] \"You will be quite welcome,\" said Clara, graciously. The young man might not have felt quite so well pleased, if he could have read what was passing in Clara\u0027s mind. \"He is not only ugly,\" she said to herself, \"but an awkward boor. I don\u0027t believe he ever spoke to a lady before. However, he may be worth catching. At any rate, it will give me a little amusement to angle for him, and I will see if I can\u0027t make an impression.\" \"Where ignorance is bliss, \u0027tis folly to be wise.\" So runs an old proverb. This was illustrated in the case of James Cromwell, who, ignorant of the real opinion entertained of him by Miss Manton, began, after a while, to conceive the delusive thought that she had taken a fancy to him. But we are anticipating. Three evenings later, when supper was concluded, James Cromwell made no movement to go back to the store. This was quickly observed by Clara, who said, with a smile: \"You are going to remain with us, this evening, are you not, Mr. Cromwell?\" \"If it will be agreeable,\" he said. \"Can you doubt it?\" she said, with a look which[Pg 112] quickened the pulsations of Cromwell\u0027s heart. \"I get so tired passing the evening alone. Papa gets hold of a paper or magazine, and I am left to my own devices for amusement.\" She invited Cromwell to their private parlor, which was furnished with a piano. \"Do you like music, Mr. Cromwell?\" she inquired. \"Very much, indeed,\" he answered, though the truth was he scarcely knew one tune from another. \"Perhaps you are a musician?\" \"Not at all,\" he said, hastily, and in this statement, at least, he was correct. \"Won\u0027t you play something, Miss Manton?\" \"I haven\u0027t anything new, but if you don\u0027t mind old pieces, I will play for you.\" She played a noisy instrumental piece, to which James Cromwell listened in silence, with very little idea of what was being played. His eyes were fixed rather on the young lady herself. \"How do you like it, Mr. Cromwell?\" \"Very much, indeed,\" said Cromwell, hitching his chair a little nearer the instrument, and then coloring, lest the movement should have been observed. \"I think I will sing you something,\" said Clara.[Pg 113] \"I don\u0027t sing in public, but before an intimate friend I do not feel so bashful.\" The words \"intimate friend,\" slipped out so easily and naturally that she seemed unconscious of them, but they were intentional, and she glanced out of the corners of her eyes to watch their effect. She saw that Cromwell\u0027s eyes brightened, and the color came to his pale cheeks, and then she knew that they had produced the effect which she intended. \"She is certainly very charming,\" thought Cromwell, \"and she is very friendly. I don\u0027t think I ever met a young lady so attractive.\" \"He\u0027s getting in love,\" said Clara to herself. \"It\u0027ll be fun to see him when he gets quite carried away by the tender passion. I\u0027ve heard of eloquent eyes, but I don\u0027t think his are capable of looking like anything except those of a ferret. Well, I\u0027ll see the play through.\" She accordingly sang the well-known song, \"Then I\u0027ll Remember Thee,\" putting into it as much meaning as possible, and occasionally glancing in a languishing manner at the young man, who sat uneasily in his chair, and began to feel all the symptoms of love. He sat as if spell-bound when she had finished. [Pg 114] \"Why don\u0027t you compliment me, Mr. Cromwell?\" she said, turning round, with a smile. \"Do you know you are wanting in your duty, sir? Every young lady expects to be complimented, when she has done a young gentleman the favor to sing to him.\" \"It was because I was so charmed,\" said James Cromwell, with more readiness than might have been expected. \"I was so charmed that I was incapable of saying a word.\" \"I am afraid you are like the rest of your sex, a sad flatterer, Mr. Cromwell,\" said the young lady, shaking her head, with a smile. \"You don\u0027t expect me to believe that, now, do you?\" \"Yes, I do, Miss Manton, for it is perfectly true,\" said James Cromwell, plucking up courage; \"you sing like a nightingale.\" \"Do I? I was so afraid you\u0027d say like an owl, or something else uncomplimentary. As you have behaved so well, I must sing you something more.\" So the evening passed. The young lady paid assiduous attention to her visitor, and when they parted her task was accomplished. James Cromwell was in love. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2997/82687.html","bookId":304,"book":{"id":304,"title":"Ralph Raymond\u0027s Heir","description":"简介： A man of middle age, muffled up in an overcoat, got out of a Third Avenue car, just opposite a small drug shop.
