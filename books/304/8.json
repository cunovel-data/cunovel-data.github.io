{"id":33155,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. JAMES CROMWELL\u0027S TRIUMPH.","content":"The coolness displayed by James Cromwell had its effect upon the merchant. Mechanically he obeyed, and resumed his seat. \"Say what have you to say, and be done with it,\" he muttered. \"In the first place, then, I beg leave to ask you a question. Do you not remember me?\" and the clerk looked searchingly with his cold gray eyes in the face of Paul Morton. \"I may possibly have met you before,\" he replied with an effort, \"but I meet a great many people, and there is no particular reason, that I am aware of, why I should remember you in particular.\" \"I also meet a considerable number of persons,\" said James Cromwell, \"but circumstances have led me to remember you very well.\" \"Well, grant that you remember me,\" said the merchant, with nervous impatience, \"what then?\" \"It may be necessary for me to remind you[Pg 58] that I am employed in a druggist\u0027s shop on the Bowery.\" \"I hope you like your situation,\" said Paul Morton, with a sneer. \"No, I don\u0027t like it, and that is the reason why I have come to you, hoping that you will help me to something better.\" This was said with quiet self-possession, and Paul Morton began to realize with uneasiness that this young man, whom he had looked upon with contempt, was not so easily to be overawed or managed as he had expected. \"This is a cool request, considering that you are a comparative stranger to me.\" \"But consider the peculiar circumstances,\" said James Cromwell, significantly. \"What peculiar circumstances?\" demanded the merchant, desperately. \"Shall I mention them?\" asked Cromwell, pointedly. \"If you want me to understand, yes. You are talking in enigmas, and I never was good at understanding enigmas.\" \"Then,\" said James Cromwell, leaning slightly forward, and looking intently at Mr. Morton, \"may I ask to what use you have put the subtle[Pg 59] poison which you purchased of me ten days since?\" The color rushed to Paul Morton\u0027s face at this direct interrogation. \"The poison?\" he repeated. \"Yes, you certainly have not forgotten the purchase.\" \"I think you must be mistaken in the person.\" \"Pardon me, I am not.\" \"Suppose that I did buy poison, how should you identify me with the purchaser, and how came you to know where I lived?\" \"I sent a boy to follow you home,\" said Cromwell. \"You dared to do that?\" \"Why not? We have no curiosity about our ordinary customers, but when a person makes such a purchase as you did, we feel inclined to learn all we can about him.\" \"A praiseworthy precaution! Well, I admit that I did buy the poison. What then?\" \"I asked to what purpose you had put it?\" \"Very well, I have no objection to tell you, although I deny your right to intrude in my private affairs, which I regard as a piece of gross impertinence. I bought it, as I think I stated to[Pg 60] you at the time, at the request and for the use of a friend.\" \"Would you tell me the friend\u0027s name?\" asked the clerk, imperturbably. \"He lives in Thirty-seventh Street.\" \"What is his name?\" \"None of your business,\" exclaimed the merchant, passionately. \"I beg your pardon, but I was blamed by my employer for not taking down the name of the purchaser, and I told him in return that I would gather full particulars.\" \"You may tell him it is all right. He must have heard of me and of my firm, and that will satisfy him.\" \"But the name of this gentleman in Thirty-seventh Street——\" \"It is not necessary to the purpose.\" \"Has there been a death in his family within ten days?\" asked the clerk in quiet tones, but there was a significance in them which sent a thrill through the frame of his listener. \"What makes you ask that?\" he stammered. \"I will tell you,\" said James Cromwell, boldly throwing off his reserve. \"It is as well to be frank, and there is no use in mincing matters. I[Pg 61] do not believe this story of the man in Thirty-seventh Street. I think you bought the article for your own use. Since the purchase there has been a death in your house.\" \"Your inference is ridiculous,\" said the merchant, nervously. \"My intimate and dear friend, Mr. Raymond, was sick of an incurable disease, as the physician will testify, and it could have terminated in no other way.\" \"I am quite willing to believe you are right,\" said the clerk. \"Still, under the circumstances, you will not object to an investigation. I feel it my duty to inform a coroner of the facts in the case, and if on examination no traces of the action of poison can be found in the deceased, of course you are entirely exonerated from suspicion!\" \"What!\" exclaimed Paul Morton. \"Do you think I will suffer myself to be subjected to such a degrading suspicion—a man of my position in society—what advantage could I possibly reap from my friend\u0027s death?\" \"He was a rich man,\" suggested James Cromwell, significantly. \"That is true,\" said the merchant, with self-possession. \"He was a rich man.\" [Pg 62] \"And he may have left his property to you.\" \"You happen to be mistaken there. He had left his property to his son, a boy of fourteen.\" \"Where is this son?\" asked the clerk, a little taken aback by this discovery, which was new to him. \"He is now in my house.\" \"And suppose the boy dies?\" It was now Paul Morton\u0027s turn to hesitate. \"That is not very probable,\" he said. \"He is a strong, vigorous boy.\" \"Who is to be his guardian?\" \"I am.\" \"Indeed! And if he dies, is there no provision made as to the property?\" \"It will go to me, if he dies before attaining his majority.\" The clerk coughed—a little significant cough—which annoyed Mr. Morton not a little. It conveyed an imputation which he couldn\u0027t resent, because it was indirect. \"I hope you are satisfied,\" he said at length. \"Oh, certainly; that is, nearly so,\" said James Cromwell: \"but then it is not enough that I should be satisfied.\" \"Why not?\" [Pg 63] \"My employer may not be.\" \"Does your employer know who made the purchase?\" \"No, I have not as yet communicated the name to him.\" \"Don\u0027t tell him, then. It is none of his business.\" \"He will not agree with you there.\" \"What matter if he does not?\" \"You must remember that I am a poor clerk, dependent on my salary, and that in my position, it is not safe to risk offending my employer. Suppose I am discharged from my position, how am I to live?\" \"Can you not procure another situation?\" \"Not if he refuses his recommendation, which would probably be the case. Besides, our business is crowded, and under the most favorable circumstances I might be weeks, and possibly months, without employment.\" Paul Morton leaned his head on his hand, and considered what was to be done with this difficult visitor. It was evident that he expected to be bought off and that he must be. \"What wages do you get?\" he asked, looking up. [Pg 64] \"Twenty dollars a week, sir,\" said Cromwell. As the reader knows, this was just double what he did receive, and as Mr. Morton was not likely to inquire of his employer, he felt that the lie was a safe one, and likely to conduce to his advantage. \"Twenty dollars a week! Very well, I will tell you what you must do. In the first place, you must refuse to make your employer any communications respecting this affair.\" \"Very well, sir.\" \"And if he discharges you, I will pay you twenty dollars a week until you can get another situation. Perhaps I may find you some other employment, unless you prefer your present business.\" \"No, sir, I don\u0027t like it.\" \"Do, then, as I tell you, and I will see that you suffer no loss.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said James Cromwell, rising. \"I will follow your directions, and let you know the result to-morrow evening.\" The clerk left the house in a very contented frame of mind. He determined to resign his situation the next morning, and claim the stipulated weekly allowance.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2997/82681.html","bookId":304,"book":{"id":304,"title":"Ralph Raymond\u0027s Heir","description":"简介： A man of middle age, muffled up in an overcoat, got out of a Third Avenue car, just opposite a small drug shop.
