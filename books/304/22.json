{"id":33169,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. THE GHOST IN NO. 41.","content":"After waiting two days, during which no tidings were received of Robert, James Cromwell determined to go to New York. He had hoped that the body might be found in order that he might carry with him the proof that would entitle him to the reward of ten thousand dollars. But he did not venture to suggest that the pond should be dragged, lest it might appear that he was too well informed about the matter. He announced his determination to Mr. Manton and Clara the evening previous. He thought it politic to assign a double motive for his departure. \"You may remember,\" he said, \"that I referred to a relative in delicate health from whom I expected a legacy.\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Manton. \"I have received intelligence that he is very low and wishes to see me. So, although it will be [Pg 172]inconvenient for me to leave my business, I find it necessary to go.\" \"Perhaps you may be rewarded for going,\" suggested Mr. Manton. \"Yes, I have no reason to doubt that I shall be well remembered in my relative\u0027s will. I think that when I return there will be nothing to prevent my complying with the conditions you named, and that I may be able to claim your daughter\u0027s hand.\" \"Perhaps I may change my mind,\" said Clara, energetically; but she saw fit to devote herself to her suitor through the entire evening, displaying an affability and assumed interest which quite captivated him. The thoughts of her favor even drove away the memories of the dark deed which, as he fully believed, had consigned to a watery grave the boy who had been committed to his charge. \"There seems some chance of his story proving true,\" said Mr. Manton, when the two were alone. \"Yes, it may be. On that chance I\u0027ve been trying to make myself agreeable to-night. He evidently thinks I\u0027m dead in love with him. As if anybody could fancy such a stupid lout. I declare I wish it was somebody else who was going to get[Pg 173] the money. The exertions I\u0027ve made have quite wearied me,\" and fair Clara yawned excessively. \"If you think you can\u0027t like him, it is not too late to withdraw,\" said the father, who had a little more heart than his daughter. \"Oh, as to that, it isn\u0027t of much consequence,\" said Clara. \"I haven\u0027t got much sentiment, and if he can show the cash, I\u0027ll marry him.\" \"I presume you won\u0027t throw away your fascinations upon him after marriage,\" said her father. \"You may be sure of that. He\u0027ll soon have a realizing sense of my motives in marrying him.\" \"Suppose he resents it, and treats you badly?\" suggested Mr. Manton, with a little paternal solicitude. \"I can protect myself,\" said Clara, with nonchalance. \"He\u0027s a weak fool and I can twist him round my finger.\" \"He may not be as manageable as you think, Clara.\" \"Oh, I know him thoroughly. He hasn\u0027t much spirit. I should be ashamed if I could not manage him.\" \"You remember Catharine in \u0027Taming the Shrew\u0027?\" \"Very polite, upon my word, to compare me to[Pg 174] a shrew. Yes, I remember her; but I shall have a different man to deal with from Petruchio. You needn\u0027t trouble yourself about me. I know what I\u0027m about.\" \"Well, it\u0027s your own affair,\" said Mr. Manton, philosophically. \"We shall know in a short time whether I am to welcome a son-in-law.\" \"Or whether your daughter is to remain a while longer \u0027an impatient rose on the ancestral tree.\u0027\" \"And use her thorns on her father instead of a husband,\" supplemented Mr. Manton. \"But you are getting bright in your old age, papa. Be careful or the rose may show its thorns.\" The conversation just recorded indicates the pleasant prospect which James Cromwell had of domestic happiness in case his wishes were gratified, and he gained the hand of the young lady. But he had no conception of her real disposition, or he might have hesitated to go farther. She had tact enough to veil her faults from the scrutiny of her lover, and present to him only an amiable and agreeable side. In the morning, James Cromwell started for New York, going by Wheeling. It so chanced that he arrived in the evening at the same hotel[Pg 175] where Robert and Major Woodley had rooms. He was fatigued by his long journey, and retired at nine o\u0027clock, or soon after his arrival. He did not think to look over the books of the hotel, or he might have made the discovery that Robert was still alive, and that his journey was likely to prove fruitless. Neither did he meet Major Woodley or Robert, for they were sitting together in the major\u0027s room until half-past ten, chatting cosily. But James Cromwell was destined to meet with an adventure, which tormented his soul with guilty fear, and gave him a great shock. It chanced that the room assigned to him was No. 41. The room occupied by Robert was No. 43, just beyond in the same corridor. As has been said, Cromwell retired to bed at half-past nine; but, though fatigued, he was unable to go to sleep—he was haunted by the thoughts of the pond and the body that lay beneath, deprived of life through his most wicked agency, and as he lay he became nervous and restless, and not even his physical fatigue could induce the coveted slumber to visit him. When Robert, coming from the room of Major Woodley, sought his own room, he could not at first remember whether it was No. 41 or 43. He[Pg 176] had the impression that it was No. 41 that had been assigned him. He accordingly opened the door of the room and stood just within the door. At the sound of the opening door James Cromwell rose in bed, and gazed with horror at the face and figure of the boy whom he supposed that he had murdered. The moonlight entering through the windows fell upon Robert\u0027s face and gave it a ghastly look, or at least seemed to do so to the excited imagination of the guilty Cromwell. He gazed spell-bound, and cowering with fear at the apparition, with difficulty ejaculated: \"Who are you?\" Of course Robert recognized Cromwell and he at once guessed the truth, that he was going to New York to give his own version of his disappearance to his uncle. He saw at once that he was mistaken for a ghost, and the desire seized him to carry out this deception. Certainly, if one were justifiable in frightening another by exciting his superstitious fears Robert was justified in terrifying the man who had so basely sought his life. When, therefore, with faltering lips, James Cromwell put the question, \"Who are you?\" Robert answered in a low, guttural voice: \"I am the spirit of the boy you murdered!\" As[Pg 177] he uttered the words, he waved one hand aloft, and made a step forward toward the bed. Excited to the wildest pitch, Cromwell trembled convulsively, then opened his lips to utter a piercing shriek, and flinging the bed-clothes over his head, cowered beneath them in craven terror. Robert thought this a good chance to make his exit. He noiselessly retreated, closing the door behind him, and entered his own room before the servants, aroused by Cromwell\u0027s shriek, could reach the door of his apartment. \"What\u0027s the matter here?\" demanded a waiter, opening the door of No. 41. The only answer was a groan from beneath the bed-clothes. \"What\u0027s the matter, I say?\" he repeated, rather sharply. The voice was so decidedly earthly that James Cromwell, somewhat relieved of his fear, removed the clothes from his head, and looked up. \"I—I don\u0027t know,\" he said, \"I think I had the night-mare.\" \"Well,\" uttered the servant, \"I hope you won\u0027t have it again. You\u0027ll wake up all that are asleep, and make them think that somebody is being murdered.\" [Pg 178] James Cromwell recoiled at the last word, and he said, hastily, for he feared a return of the supposed spirit: \"My friend, if you\u0027ll come in here and stop till I\u0027ve gone to sleep, I\u0027ll pay you for your trouble. I\u0027m afraid of having the night-mare again.\" \"Can\u0027t do it; I haven\u0027t got the time. Besides, what\u0027s the use? You won\u0027t have the night-mare when you\u0027re awake.\" He shut the door, and James Cromwell lay for a long time in a state of nervous terror, trying to go to sleep, but unable to do so. At last, from sheer fatigue, he fell into a troubled slumber, which was disturbed by terrifying dreams. He woke, at an early hour unrefreshed, and going below ordered a breakfast which he did not relish. Thence he went to the depot and took the early morning train bound eastward. He was already speeding on his way rapidly before Robert Raymond arose. The door of No. 41 was open, and he looked in. But the occupant had disappeared. Going to the office he saw the name of James Cromwell on the books of the hotel, and learned from the clerk that he had already gone. \"He\u0027s a queer chap,\" said the clerk; \"he had[Pg 179] a terrible night-mare last night, and shrieked loud enough to take the roof off. You must have heard him, as your room adjoined his!\" \"Yes, I heard him,\" said Robert, but he said no more.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2997/82695.html","bookId":304,"book":{"id":304,"title":"Ralph Raymond\u0027s Heir","description":"简介： A man of middle age, muffled up in an overcoat, got out of a Third Avenue car, just opposite a small drug shop.
