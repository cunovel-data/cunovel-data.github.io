{"id":103534,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"As Court made his way through the house, he tried to get a grasp of what had just happened. Staring at her eyes, at her plump lips, he\u0027d had a hard time concentrating, but he\u0027d known that she didn\u0027t want him - at least not at first. Her actions had been calculated. She\u0027d had an agenda, and it had been a blow.\n He\u0027d finally gotten to kiss her, and he\u0027d been left...empty. That she\u0027d seemed to catch on fire like a wick soothed his pride somewhat. Christ, he\u0027d spoken the truth - he\u0027d had a real chance of taking her on the table. And he wouldn\u0027t have hesitated.\n But now the emptiness turned to ire. He\u0027d truly wanted her while she only wanted something from him - to what end he was sure he\u0027d find out soon enough.\n At the front entrance he paused, putting a hand against the wall beside the door, shaking off her effect on him. He curled his fingers against the plaster, willing his body under control, then finally opened the door wide to five of his crew.\n \"Court!\" exclaimed Gavin MacKriel, the oldest of their band. \"By God, it\u0027s good to see you.\"\n When the man took his shoulders, Court frowned and slapped him on the back with his better hand, then again until Gavin released him and moved on.\n MacTiernay, the one-eyed giant, looked him up and down, then punched him in the upper chest in greeting before walking past.\n Court stared after him. That was more emotion than MacTiernay had ever demonstrated. Then Niall, his cousin, slapped him on the back, and Liam, the youngest, was about to as well until Court gave him a look of warning. The last inside, Fergus, who\u0027d earned the nickname The Sleeping Scot, actually looked awake and glad to see him.\n He showed them in and then on into the parlor. As if he owned the place. \"Where are the rest?\"\n Liam had already nabbed a pear from a fruit-laden bowl in the foyer. At nineteen he was still growing and could eat double his weight in food every day. He took a bite and said between chews, \"They have been searching for a body for your kin to bury.\"\n \"I appreciate the sentiment.\" Court took a seat at the main table, feeling weak from their greetings. Nothing like Highlanders striking you to get your mind off a woman. \"You were that sure I was dead?\"\n \"We followed your pair of Rechazados,\" Fergus answered as he eased himself into a seat, \"then persuaded them to partake in one last conversation. They told us they\u0027d killed you.\"\n \"That was the plan. You took out two? We\u0027re at forty-seven, then?\"\n \"Forty-seven and counting,\" Gavin said. \"I hope you told them we were coming to kill them.\"\n \"Aye, I did. It dinna have the effect I was hoping for, but satisfies now.\"\n Niall stood to survey a wine sideboard. \"After we got your message, I sent the rest of the crew to the smuggler\u0027s lodge to wait for us.\"\n Niall was to take over their band if anything happened to him, and Court nodded his approval at Niall\u0027s decision. They\u0027d stumbled upon the isolated lodge while exploring the back passes along the border with France. It was filled with long-abandoned luxuries, dust-covered crates packed with silver, porcelain, and crystal that some smuggler had never made it back for.\n \"And I brought your gear,\" Niall added. \"You doona look like you\u0027re hurting for clothes, but I bet you miss your weapons.\"\n \"You\u0027ve no idea.\" When he\u0027d heard riders coming, he hadn\u0027t known if he\u0027d finally brought Pascal\u0027s men down upon this place. He hadn\u0027t known how he\u0027d protect her from them.\n \"So whose home is this?\" Niall asked.\n \"An Andorran lass\u0027s.\" Court wondered if they could see he was thrown. No battle, no violence had ever made him off balance like this.\n Niall gave him a razor-sharp look. \"She\u0027s bonny?\" Yes, Niall could see.\n \"Aye,\" he admitted. Moments ago, that beautiful woman had sunk her fingers into his muscles to get closer to him. He\u0027d thought her reaction was real and reveled in it, but if she was willing to manipulate him...He caught them regarding him quizzically. \"She found me half dead by the river and dragged me back here. No men around, so I\u0027ve just been lingering on.\"\n \"Dragged you? So she\u0027s a big, bonny Andorran?\"\n \"She and her horse dragged me. No, she\u0027s just a wee thing. You should see her - a good gust would send her reeling.\" Court noticed Niall studying him and changed the subject. \"Have you heard any news?\"\n Niall removed a bottle of wine and whistled at the label before saying, \"We heard word that Spain might come for its deserters any day now. And if they doona, France will.\"\n \"It\u0027s about bloody time.\" Court had been continually disgusted with the lack of action against the invasion. Yes, Andorra was small, but its location was critical, as Pascal well knew. \"Where\u0027d you hear this?\"\n Gavin scratched his neck. \"From Otto.\"\n \"Otto, huh?\" Court\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Now why would he be contacting us?\"\n Gavin hesitated, then said, \"He\u0027s...overextended again.\"\n \"He usually is.\" Which was why Court had broken from the Prussian\u0027s company years ago and formed his own. \"What\u0027s it this time? Sixty against five hundred?\" Otto kept his band winnowed down and repeatedly contracted for huge jobs. Great way to make a lot of coin. Sure way to get killed.\n \"Could be that many,\" Niall said absently as he returned the bottle and selected another. By the look on his face, this one was even more valuable. Not that Niall was such the wine expert, but he had an uncanny sense for money and could perceive value like a dog could scent a trail.\n \"And he\u0027s coming to us hat in hand?\" Court didn\u0027t like where this was going. Some of his men didn\u0027t mind playing the odds, no matter how bad they were.\n Gavin nodded. \"We might be able to recoup some of the pay we lost here.\"\n Court shook his head firmly. \"We have no\u0027 lost it yet.\"\n \"No shame in cutting bait,\" Niall said. \"Another crew, those Tyrolean sharpshooters, left without pay.\"\n Gavin added, \"The region\u0027s unstable and everybody\u0027s tails are twitching. No one wants to go head to head with Pascal, especially no\u0027 after what he did to you.\"\n Niall removed his gaze from the wine to study Court. \"They banged you up good?\"\n So much that Court was still astonished that he\u0027d lived. \"Them and the river. I had to jump blind into the falls, then ride them headfirst.\"\n \"And your wrist?\" Niall asked. Court had never met a more sharp-eyed person than his cousin. \"Looks odd and you\u0027re favoring one hand.\"\n His wrist should look odd, since it was very stiff and sorer than usual, due solely to the fact that ten minutes ago he\u0027d had both hands splayed on Annal¨ªa\u0027s lush bottom. \"Broke it. Had a cast on it. I think another week till I\u0027m right.\"\n \"A cast?\" Niall asked with disbelief. \"What\u0027s wrong with leather between the teeth until it stops paining you? Casts are for bairn and lasses when they fall off their ponies.\"\n Only Liam and Gavin laughed. The impassive MacTiernay had never indicated he was capable of it, and Fergus had already crossed his arms over his chest and was slumped back asleep.\n \"I dinna have any say on the cast.\" Court gingerly flexed his fingers. \"The Andorran did it when I was knocked out.\" He frowned at Niall, who was returning to the table with the bottle uncorked and a clutch of wine glasses. Perhaps they ought not be drinking this bottle if it was dearer than the one that Niall had whistled over.\n \"So how long were you out?\" Niall asked as he poured a round.\n \"Two days.\" Though Court wasn\u0027t normally a wine drinker, he accepted a glass, curious to see what it\u0027d taste like. His drink of choice was whisky because it rendered him as jovial as he\u0027d ever get. Wine? Not so much. \"I\u0027m just surprised Pascal dinna find me in all this time.\"\n \"He\u0027s searching the countryside, but not as he might in the past because he\u0027s been busy. Hark this - he\u0027s taking a bride,\" Niall said. \"She\u0027s some Spanish aristocrat, supposed to have royal blood or some such. Marrying her will give him more claim to Spain than any of the generals before him.\"\n Gavin drank and gave Niall an impressed look as if he\u0027d grown the grapes, then added, \"Rumor is that she\u0027s happy about the nuptials.\"\n Court leaned back, disgusted. \"Then they deserve each other.\"\n Liam drank his glass in one gulp. \"So where\u0027s this cast-making lass?\"\n \"She\u0027ll be in her room.\" He surveyed his men, trying to imagine what she\u0027d think of them, and added, \"Most likely for the night.\"\n Liam got a sly look on his face. \"You tire her out so much that she canna leave her bed?\"\n He scrubbed a hand over his mouth and couldn\u0027t help saying, \"I wish.\"\n Niall raised his eyebrows. \"A lass Court MacCarrick canna have? That breed does no\u0027 exist.\"\n He exhaled loudly. \"It does in the Andorran mountains.\"\n They\u0027d simply taken over the house, ransacking the wine cellar, flipping through books, pilfering a stash of tobacco, and Court suspected they\u0027d already cleaned out the larder. Two hours and over a dozen bottles of wine between them later, Court was discovering that the stone of weight he\u0027d lost ensured he was drunker than usual.\n He\u0027d just pushed aside his last glass when he heard the front door groan open. \"I\u0027ll be back,\" he said, his words just shy of slurred as he dashed out of his chair.\n He caught up with Annal¨ªa on the path and took her shoulder. \"Where do you think you\u0027re going?\"\n \"To sleep elsewhere.\" She flung her shoulder back to break his grip.\n \"No, I doona believe you will,\" he drawled, finally releasing her.\n \"You think to order me in my own home?\"\n He said easily, \"Aye.\"\n She smoothed her hair. She\u0027d put it up again, but it was looser. He suspected she still might be drunk.\n \"It\u0027s one thing to remain in a house with an incapacitated patient,\" she said, with her accent thicker than he\u0027d ever heard it. \"It\u0027s quite another to be an unmarried young woman staying with a gang of mercenaries.\"\n \"Ah, Annal¨ªa, you have no\u0027 even met them.\" Suddenly, he wanted them to see her, to understand what he\u0027d been tempted with. He took her arm.\n \"What are you doing? MacCarrick?\"\n He hated that he liked hearing her say his name. She\u0027d whispered it in his ear while testing her wiles on him - wiles that infuriated him because he knew if she\u0027d had any experience...\n He swung her inside and into the parlor, announcing, \"And this would be the lady of the house. Lady Annal¨ªa Llorente.\"\n The men rose and her eyes widened at their size even as their eyes narrowed at her. When Court moved to sit and watch, they advanced on her until she backed to the wall.\n \"\u0027Bonny\u0027 was a bit of an understatement, then?\" Niall said over his shoulder.\n Court shrugged and retrieved his glass.\n As Gavin introduced himself, he took her hand and kissed it. Court could see he was rubbing her skin with his thumb, and he wondered why that raised his hackles and why he now regretted showing her off. Gavin told the others in Gaelic that they had to feel her hands.\n They did so, one at a time, introducing themselves, with Liam exclaiming, \"You have yourself some wee, soft hands.\"\n Niall alone didn\u0027t touch her. Probably because he\u0027d determined exactly what Court was thinking.\n Their petting seemed to put her in a panic, but her reaction to the men didn\u0027t surprise him. They were all huge and scarred. Fergus was missing fingers and MacTiernay was taller than all of them and had only one eye. She\u0027d been intimidated by Court, too, but she\u0027d still initiated a kiss. Whatever she wanted of him, she wanted it very badly indeed.\n \"Lady Annal¨ªa, thank you for allowing us to stay here,\" Niall said.\n \"She didn\u0027t,\" Court informed them. \"She wants all of us gone.\"\n She put her chin up. \"Mr. MacCarrick, my first priority is to the people of this place. Even if you are not allied with Pascal any longer, your presence still jeopardizes everyone here.\"\n Court gave a harsh laugh. \"Now that sounds very noble, but why do you no\u0027 tell them what you told me at the door? You want us gone to preserve appearances.\"\n She didn\u0027t back down. \"That is important as well. If my reputation is tarnished, I will not be able to make the match that is expected of me.\"\n Niall muttered, \"Court, she\u0027s right - \"\n He interrupted, \"You were planning to ask me for something tonight, were you no\u0027? Do it now.\"\n She opened her mouth to speak, then closed it and turned her face away.\n \"Perhaps in the morning you\u0027ll be inclined to make your request. Perhaps we\u0027ll be inclined to hear it - if we stay here.\"\n She faced him again. \"Very well, stay. We can speak when I return - \"\n \"You stay here, too.\"\n She straightened her choker, appearing so miserable he almost relented. He could feel his men watching him and her, knew they were confounded by his behavior.\n She swallowed and then said in a pained tone, \"Yes, of course. I extend my welcome to your men and look forward to our meeting.\"\n \"Go to bed, Annal¨ªa. You\u0027ll need your rest after the night we\u0027ve had.\" She looked like she\u0027d been struck, gasping a breath before sweeping from the room.\n Niall didn\u0027t wait until she was even out of earshot. \"What the hell is wrong with you?\"\n \"Doona start on me. She\u0027s no\u0027 as helpless as she appears and she\u0027s been insulting me regularly for a week.\" When Niall looked unconvinced, Court added, \"She\u0027s calculating and she\u0027s spoiled, and tonight she sought to manipulate me, cutting her teeth and testing her wiles.\" He ran a hand over the back of his neck, uneasy because he knew if she\u0027d had any experience...she could\u0027ve worked him like dough. \"It was no\u0027 right.\"\n Niall shook his head. \"I doona believe I\u0027ve ever seen you treat a lass this poorly.\"\n \"That\u0027s because you\u0027ve no\u0027 met a woman like her. I\u0027m telling you, you\u0027ve never known such an arrogant female in your life. Tomorrow you\u0027ll see.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-6.html","bookId":2644,"book":{"id":2644,"title":"If You Dare (MacCarrick Brothers #1)","description":"Storyline: \n If You Dare (MacCarrick Brothers #1) \n Kresley Cole introduces a thrilling new romance trilogy featuring fierce Scottish brothers with dangerous lives, dark desires, and a deadly curse. \n Can he exact revenge? \n High in the Pyrenees, a band of mercenaries led by Courtland MacCarrick wages war for General Reynaldo Pascal.
