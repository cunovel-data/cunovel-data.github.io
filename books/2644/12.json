What is this about?\" Pascal demanded.\n Olivia answered easily. \"When I can\u0027t sleep, I enjoy plaguing him.\" Her face was cold.\n He scrutinized her for a moment, then gave her a smile of relief. \"I\u0027d worried. Some women might find him handsome.\"\n \"He is weak. I could never see past that,\" she said in a steady tone. She\u0027d learned to be like this when her relatives first sent her to live with Pascal. She\u0027d been ten and had just lost her mother, Ysobel Olivia, who had been her entire world.\n Her relatives thought her an abomination, and treated her as one, frightening and confusing her because her gentle mother had adored her and showed her how much every day. Compared to them, Pascal hadn\u0027t seemed so bad once she learned that he wanted her to be like him.\n She\u0027d excelled, fooled everyone, fooled herself, until that one night last spring just before they were to leave for Andorra when she\u0027d overheard the servants whispering about her mother. They\u0027d talked of Pascal and his three favored soldiers riding into her mother\u0027s village, smelling of \"blood and evil.\" Pascal had been instantly besotted with the beautiful widow Ysobel.\n As ever, he\u0027d taken what he desired....\n \"Perhaps you will refrain?\" he asked Olivia, though they both knew it was an order.\n She looked him in the eye, making her face like marble, her expression blank. He liked that about her. He\u0027d never know the secrets her mind held. Like how she knew that the night he took her mother, he\u0027d been feeling generous.\n \"Of course, Papa,\" she said, though there was only a twenty-five percent chance that he was.\n After a dinner where he ate little and drank nothing, Court joined Niall outside on the porch, sinking onto a rough-hewn bench. The night was cool and the moon cast light as if it were day. Shadows framed every corner and tree, making it impossible to relax.\n \"How\u0027s the lass?\" Niall asked. \"Specifically, what state have you put her in?\"\n Court shrugged. She wouldn\u0027t even look at him when he brought her food, just sat on that unwieldy cot with her knees drawn up to her chest, body tense, and eyes glittering with fury. Her chin was scraped from his kiss.\n She should be furious at him; he\u0027d behaved like the beast she thought him and had no explanation for himself, much less for her. He\u0027d never lost control like that.\n She\u0027d said Pascal hadn\u0027t touched her and he believed her, but had he kissed her? Had Pascal shown more restraint than Court had? Likely. And she\u0027d chosen him over Court. She probably found the man attractive. He scowled at the thought, knowing every woman would find him so.\n \"Do you think she\u0027s planning something?\" Niall asked.\n \"Count on it, after her stunt at the riverside.\"\n \"You\u0027d have done the same thing in her position.\"\n \"Aye, but that does no\u0027 help me now. She\u0027ll keep trying. Do I go in there and force her to believe her brother is dead? I\u0027m a bastard, but I doona know if I can shake that into her. Besides, Pascal and his daughter have her fooled.\"\n \"Hell, Pascal fooled us.\"\n Court couldn\u0027t argue with that.\n \"Listen, your brothers\u0027ll flay me if I let anything happen to you.\"\n \"No\u0027 again,\" he snapped as he stood to lean against a splintery pillar.\n \"The curse, Court,\" he said simply.\n Walk with death or walk alone. They\u0027d all heard it.\n \"You know you can never have a woman of your own. And still, sometimes you look at the lass as if you\u0027d like nothing more than to keep her.\"\n \"I doona plan to.\"\n \"Things have a way of happening outside of our plans.\"\n \"No\u0027 to me, they doona. Never in fact. And I\u0027ve got a book to prove it.\"\n \"Aye, the book. \u0027Death and torment to those caught in your wake,\u0027\" he quoted. \"Do you think the lass truly will be safe when we leave her in France?\"\n \"Does no\u0027 matter, does it? I broke it and I\u0027ll fix it, then it\u0027s done. I dinna sign on to be her lifelong guardian.\"\n \"The idea of leaving her behind is no\u0027 sitting well with the men. Both MacMungan brothers said they\u0027d take her to wed right now, and more are on their way. Even Liam said he\u0027d take her if we\u0027re just going to throw her away.\"\n Court\u0027s answer was a cruel laugh. Annal¨ªa, being so unusual and vivid, would wither like fruit on the vine among the dour MacMungan clan. Liam could never control her. \"The only reason they\u0027d be infatuated is because they\u0027ve never encountered anything like her before.\" He couldn\u0027t fault them for freeing her for a morning even as his ire grew just thinking about it. He was responsible for this - he\u0027d brought a delicate foreign beauty among a band of coarse Highlanders. \"I wonder if they ever considered her unbounded hatred of Scots?\"\n \"Aye, she mistrusts us, and finds our ways strange, but her prejudice amuses the men. They know she\u0027s no\u0027 a spiteful lass, she just does no\u0027 know better. Hell, when they asked to touch her hand, she even shyly allowed it.\"\n That made him gnash his teeth. \"And how\u0027d you find it, Niall?\"\n He hesitated. \"Softer than I could conceive,\" he finally said. \"But that\u0027s no\u0027 what\u0027s important. You ken she\u0027s never been treated like this, and if you\u0027d be a wee bit more gentle in your dealings with her, she might no\u0027 be so quick to believe the things she\u0027s heard.\"\n \"Gentle? She was no\u0027 gentle when she bashed my head yesterday.\"\n \"She was afraid,\" he said, waving it away. \"A woman like that needs to be cosseted, which she\u0027s no\u0027 been. I saw her face.\"\n Court exhaled, then reluctantly admitted, \"I doona want to be so with her.\" But everything about her made him crazed. Her feminine mannerisms, her accent, even the way she blushed all combined to drive him mad. In a low tone, he said, \"I want to be different with her, but...I canna seem to.\"\n \"Then why do you no\u0027 just ride ahead to Toulouse? We can meet you at the posting house.\"\n That thought infuriated him. \"No.\"\n \"Why, Court?\"\n \"Because I\u0027m no\u0027 ready to be done with her yet.\"\n \"Christ, you can be a selfish bloody bastard. Sometimes I feel I doona even know you anymore.\"\n \"Of course, I can be. I\u0027m still a mercenary and a killer. Hell, I\u0027d sell my own sister. Is that no\u0027 what they say in the clan?\"\n \"They say that because you will no\u0027 return - \"\n \"I\u0027ll return when I\u0027ve paid off my land - which I canna do now short of riding for Otto.\" At Niall\u0027s raised eyebrows, Court added, \"Everyone needs that pay. I need that pay.\"\n Niall gave him a disappointed look. \"Life is not all about money. I thought you realized that when we broke from him.\"\n \"What is it about, Niall?\" he snapped. Inside, two men glanced up from arm wrestling. Court lowered his voice. \"If I canna have a woman and family of my own, and if I lose the land I\u0027ve worked bloody hard for, then what exactly is my life about?\"\n \"I doona know. You\u0027ll have to figure that out for yourself. But I do know it\u0027s no\u0027 about staying near a young woman until you destroy her life.\"\n \"You\u0027re that sure I\u0027d destroy it?\"\n \"Ethan did with his woman.\"\n Years ago, Ethan had gotten engaged to Sarah, a girl he hardly knew from the neighboring MacKinnon clan. Her family had been eager, even after hearing of the curse, and Ethan\u0027s title demanded an heir, so he\u0027d agreed. Sarah died at the age of nineteen, she died the night before the wedding, and no one knew how. \"I\u0027m no\u0027 Ethan, and I doona intend to get engaged to the chit!\"\n \"And what about your da?\"\n Court swung around to face Niall, brows drawn, feeling as though he\u0027d been punched. \"I...We dinna mean...\" He trailed off. What to say? That he and his brothers hadn\u0027t been responsible for their father\u0027s death? \"You would remind me of that?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry I needed to, Court.\" Niall put a hand on his shoulder before turning for the door. \"You\u0027ve much to consider.\"\n To consider? Court would no more want to purposely revisit the morning his father had died than he would desire to truly contemplate his future. But hadn\u0027t he been doing both in the last few days? Since he\u0027d met Annal¨ªa, he\u0027d thought more about what he was missing than he had in the previous decade.\n He started for her room, not knowing what he would say to her, not caring if she insulted him, but just wanting...something. He unlocked the door, then eased it open.\n The air escaped his lungs, and he leaned his head on his forearm against the doorway. \"Bloody hell.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-12.html","bookId":2644,"book":{"id":2644,"title":"If You Dare (MacCarrick Brothers #1)","description":"Storyline: \n If You Dare (MacCarrick Brothers #1) \n Kresley Cole introduces a thrilling new romance trilogy featuring fierce Scottish brothers with dangerous lives, dark desires, and a deadly curse. \n Can he exact revenge? \n High in the Pyrenees, a band of mercenaries led by Courtland MacCarrick wages war for General Reynaldo Pascal.
