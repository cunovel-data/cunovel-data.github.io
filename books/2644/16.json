{"id":103544,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\"Why...how...explain!\" she cried.\n With an impatient look, he dropped his hands to his sides.\n She knew he resented her ordering him about, but she couldn\u0027t help it. She had to know. \"K-Killed?\"\n \"No, no. Your brother escaped.\"\n She grabbed his shirt with both hands. \"You tell the truth?\"\n \"Aye.\"\n She shook his collar until he raised his eyebrows. \"That monster doesn\u0027t have him anymore?\"\n \"No, Aleixandre Llorente escaped Pascal. In fact, you\u0027re in much more danger than he is.\"\n She released him. \"I must find him! Let him know I\u0027m unhurt.\"\n \"How do you plan to do that? We just confirmed that you\u0027re a Rechazado target. That\u0027s what they\u0027re notorious for - never missing a target. They\u0027ll trail you for as long as it takes.\"\n She held her forehead between her thumb and forefinger. \"I don\u0027t know! I can\u0027t think.\" She began pacing.\n \"The posting house is up the road no\u0027 more than a few miles. You can eat, rest, and digest what\u0027s happened. And then you can plan.\"\n He was right. They\u0027d just been dragging bodies off the side of the road - a cup of tea wasn\u0027t an unreasonable thing to desire! She could feel herself shivering, could feel her bandage beginning to dampen.\n When she nodded, he helped her onto her horse, then mounted his own.\n Aleix is alive! her mind repeated like a mantra. And free! She felt lighter, she felt...hopeful. She would find her brother, and then they\u0027d figure out a way to defeat Pascal.\n For three days, she\u0027d feared he\u0027d been killed, but every second that had passed, she\u0027d plotted to get away from MacCarrick in case he hadn\u0027t been. Now to learn her brother was alive and free...\n But what if MacCarrick was the one who\u0027d fought him? Biting her lip, she watched the Highlander ahead of her as he looked to the sky, no doubt determining from the thunderheads that they were about to get drenched.\n If MacCarrick and Aleix had been enemies, who knew what this man\u0027s agenda was? For all she knew, he might be planning to recoup his money by ransoming her to her rich brother. Clucking her horse on, she trotted up beside him. \"I have a question for you.\"\n He swept a glance at her, but said nothing.\n \"I want to know if you attacked my brother and his men.\"\n He didn\u0027t hesitate. \"I never attacked your brother.\"\n \"You swear it?\" she asked, looking up at him.\n He met her gaze directly. \"Aye.\"\n \"Why are you helping me now? Why not just ride on and leave me behind?\"\n \"I plan to do that just as soon as I get you to this inn.\"\n At least he was honest about that. If someone like him had gone on about duty or helping her from a sense of gratitude, she would\u0027ve ridden away from him as fast as she could.\n At his reply, she smiled up at him, and his brows drew together. \"Still canna wait to get rid of me?\"\n Well, that depends on how you answer my questions... \"MacCarrick, how did you come to contract with Pascal?\" She knew why Pascal had hired his men - she\u0027d learned much at the smuggler\u0027s lodge. The band had been together and successful for nearly a decade, their reputation notorious. They were to train the deserters and fight against Spain. She could clearly see their appeal, but why would MacCarrick sign on with a despot?\n \"He was hiring. We were between jobs.\"\n \"Would you have continued with Pascal if he\u0027d paid you?\"\n \"I canna say.\"\n \"The men told me that I had it backwards. That you quit first and then Pascal refused to pay you for the work you\u0027d done - not the other way around.\"\n \"Did they now?\" he asked without interest. But he didn\u0027t deny it.\n They had, though she\u0027d never quite believed them until now. \"So why Pascal?\" she asked. \"Many thought his ideals were sound at first. Did you as well?\"\n He ignored her.\n She wouldn\u0027t be dissuaded. She was about to make a decision and she needed facts. \"Pascal had you beaten because you defied him. Because you thought what he was doing was wrong. Isn\u0027t that what happened?\"\n He shrugged. Again no denial.\n Mare de D¨¦u, everything she\u0027d heard from his men had been true. \"Why won\u0027t you admit that to me? Why did you let me believe that you and your men were out stealing and killing?\" She put her chin up. \"You know what I suspect? That you\u0027re not nearly as brutal as people think.\"\n He reined his horse in, cutting hers off, and stared her down, looking very brutal indeed. She swallowed and caught herself leaning back in the saddle away from him.\n \"You\u0027ve been clever in our dealings, I\u0027ll give you that, but your first major mistake would be attributin\u0027 traits to me that are no\u0027 there. I am that brutal. I\u0027m just selective in who enjoys it.\"\n With that, he rode ahead, but not far away. He\u0027d given her another warning, but this time she took his words the opposite of how he intended them. Perhaps she should stop attributing malice and studied murder to him, and see that he wasn\u0027t a fiend like Pascal.\n She hadn\u0027t been completely mistaken about MacCarrick. He had killed easily and could be terrifying. The look on his face when he\u0027d been about to question that one today...She shivered. She\u0027d never seen anything so frightening - it was as though borrowed from a nightmare. No, she would never underestimate the seething power she\u0027d sensed in him, a power that he\u0027d proved he could unleash in the beat of a heart. But it was what was in addition to these traits that puzzled her.\n Every one of the preceding nights, he\u0027d seen to her wound, forcing her to remove her blouse, to undress in front of him. During these times, she\u0027d been so full of hatred and grief that she\u0027d thought his actions were just another indignity, a chance to see her in only her chemise. Now, thinking back, she saw other things. She recalled how he\u0027d gone to one knee in front of her and how if she winced or hissed in pain, he grated, \"Doona want to hurt you.\"\n The night she\u0027d been shot, she dimly remembered that he had talked to her on the jostling ride to France, sometimes in rough Gaelic, most times making no sense even in English, but it was as if he\u0027d known she hadn\u0027t wanted to hear silence. She remembered that afterward someone had stroked her hair - someone with very callused hands....\n She sighed, realizing that she was both free of any real grounds to hate him - and in need of his help in this perilous time. Lost in thought, her mind a whir of ideas, she scarcely noticed the first drop of rain. Or another splatting directly afterward.\n When a full torrent swept down and she lagged behind, he rode back for her. \"We need to stop under the next bridge.\"\n \"MacCarrick!\" She blinked against the rain. She was freezing in her light jacket and only one thought was getting her through this ride. \"I want a hot bath and I want to drink tea when I\u0027m in it!\"\n He raised his eyebrows at her tone, then seemed to study her and the situation as if he didn\u0027t quite know what his next step should be. She could swear he was struggling to make a decision. The second she thought he might have, he plucked her from her saddle.\n \"What are you doing?\"\n He placed her sideways on his lap with her back against his arm, pulling her close so he could wrap the edges of his jacket around her. After he grabbed her horse\u0027s reins, he gently used his whole hand to turn her face into his chest.\n \"Hold on tae me,\" he murmured, \"and mind your arm.\"\n She was still protesting when he spurred the horse and they flew down the road, until she was forced to put her arms around him. His body was so incredibly warm in his jacket that soon she was, too. The rain no longer stung her face.\n Out of the blue, she remembered one of her nanny\u0027s sayings. A bear is only a bear till you rub his belly. A wolf will eat from your hand if the treat is sweet enough.... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-16.html","bookId":2644,"book":{"id":2644,"title":"If You Dare (MacCarrick Brothers #1)","description":"Storyline: \n If You Dare (MacCarrick Brothers #1) \n Kresley Cole introduces a thrilling new romance trilogy featuring fierce Scottish brothers with dangerous lives, dark desires, and a deadly curse. \n Can he exact revenge? \n High in the Pyrenees, a band of mercenaries led by Courtland MacCarrick wages war for General Reynaldo Pascal.
