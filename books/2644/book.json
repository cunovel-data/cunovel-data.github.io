When Court turns on the evil general, Pascal orders him killed, but Court narrowly escapes and exacts revenge by kidnapping Pascal\u0027s exquisite Castilian fiancée. \n Can she deny her passions? \n Lady Annalía Tristán Llorente despises her towering, barbaric captor almost as much as she does Pascal. Her inexplicable attraction to the Highlander only fuels her fury. But nothing will stop her from returning to Pascal—for if she doesn\u0027t wed him, she signs her brother\u0027s death warrant, as well as her own. \n Can there be love between them? \n From the moment Court discovers that Anna\u0027s prim façade masks a fiery, brave lass, his heart\u0027s ensnared, and he dares to defy the curse that has shadowed his life—to walk with death or walk alone. But Pascal vows that he\u0027ll hunt the two, never stopping until he\u0027s destroyed them both.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1.jpg","author":"Kresley Cole","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":37,"category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
