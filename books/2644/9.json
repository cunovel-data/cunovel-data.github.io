{"id":103537,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Last night for the dinner welcoming several odious supporters of the general, Annal¨ªa had been given a demure yet luxurious gown. Tonight Pascal had sent her a wholly red, ridiculously low-cut farce to wear. While everyone else enjoyed the village festival, she and Pascal were to have a private dinner. Just the two of them. With a dress like this, Annal¨ªa could guess why.\n She was endeavoring to work it higher over her breasts with hopping and yanking when Olivia entered without knocking. The witch strolled straight to the wardrobe to survey Annal¨ªa\u0027s clothes with an acquisitive gleam in her eyes. This morning her jewelry had suffered the same indignity.\n \"What do you want?\"\n \"Tell me,\" Olivia said casually as she took out, appraised, and returned a gown, \"why he is unmarried.\"\n In an instant, Annal¨ªa had her whirled around and her hands clenched around Olivia\u0027s arms. \"You\u0027ve seen Aleix?\" She could tell she\u0027d surprised her. \"Have you?\"\n Olivia shoved her arms loose. \"Why isn\u0027t he married?\" she stubbornly asked again.\n Did her curiosity mean she was attracted to Aleix? All the women in the village thought he was handsome with his tall build and his somber, golden-colored eyes. Mare de D¨¦u, could this spawn of Pascal have feelings for him? And how could she use that to their advantage?\n \"He\u0027s a widower,\" she admitted, though she felt as if she dangled a bare foot to a viper. \"His wife died in childbirth.\"\n Olivia\u0027s face was a blank slate. Annal¨ªa couldn\u0027t read her. \"He has a child?\"\n \"No, his daughter died as well.\"\n Olivia shrugged. So that Annal¨ªa wouldn\u0027t slap her, she forced herself to imagine that Olivia hiked her shoulders every time something particularly upsetting was said.\n \"Why are you interested?\"\n She ran her finger across the coverlet on her way to the window. \"I was merely curious about my father\u0027s prisoner.\"\n \"Let me tell you more,\" Annal¨ªa said as she perched on the edge of the bed. Olivia turned to stare out the window, but she didn\u0027t say no.\n \"Aleix is a good man, a strong man. He lives in a beautiful manor overlooking pastures filled with his champion horses. Each day he watches them run, and though he says nothing, I know how pleased he is with them.\"\n Had her shoulders relaxed somewhat? \"He\u0027s very intelligent and well read. He went to school overseas at Cambridge. He\u0027s somber now, but he wasn\u0027t always.\" Annal¨ªa decided then to divulge something she considered private. \"He\u0027s just very lonely up on his mountain.\"\n Olivia shrugged again. \"I can\u0027t abide this prattle any longer.\" She crossed the room to the door.\n \"He\u0027s here, isn\u0027t he?\" Annal¨ªa asked. \"I\u0027m in the far end of this house because he\u0027s in the other.\"\n Olivia turned, with her gaze flickering over her, and Annal¨ªa could tell she was calculating her answer, knew she would never say anything unless it somehow served her. \"Pascal wants you downstairs in five minutes. Do not displease him. Both of you will suffer for it.\"\n She hadn\u0027t denied that Aleix was here! Though she hadn\u0027t said anything to confirm it either, Annal¨ªa was convinced. \"Thank you for the advice. I\u0027ll give you some in return. You\u0027re about to be married, Olivia. And to one of those loathsome men last night.\"\n \"Hold your tongue. How would you know that?\"\n \"In cruelty and killings, I\u0027ll gladly defer to you, but I know marriages. Pascal\u0027s in a tenuous position and he just happens to convene a meeting with his supporters? How convenient that each one is socially and politically well connected in Spain - and unwed.\"\n Coach-and-six. A father would pay a surprise visit to his daughter at school, and when she walked into the drawing room, he\u0027d introduce her to her new, rich, politically connected fianc¨¦. The man\u0027s looks and temperament would be incidental and would rarely match his prospects, but the commerce of marriage would\u0027ve been decided before the girl ever had any idea she was leaving. With a handshake, her life was snatched from her.\n Annal¨ªa didn\u0027t know that she could wish one of those men even on Olivia.\n Olivia glared at her. \"You won\u0027t manipulate me into dissension. I\u0027ll simply ask Pascal.\" She turned for the door.\n \"And I\u0027m confident he\u0027ll tell you the truth,\" she called after Olivia before hurriedly tussling with the bodice one last time. Finding no success there, she made sure her choker - or her \"collar\" as the hateful Scot had called it - was in perfect place. With luck, her formal jewelry, which Pascal had insisted she wear, would be glittery enough to draw his gaze away from her breasts.\n Though she dreaded being seen like this, she would never be late and anger the general. Her brother\u0027s treatment was to be commensurate with her behavior.\n Annal¨ªa knew Aleix was in this house, and she planned to persuade Olivia to help them. Though Pascal had said he would kill any servant who helped them, surely he wouldn\u0027t hurt his own daughter if she were caught.\n Annal¨ªa\u0027s brows drew together when she recalled how Pascal had smiled at her last night in a way she might describe as lovingly. She\u0027d determined that how strong and proud and good he appeared was directly proportional to how evil he was. Remembering his charisma and startlingly handsome visage in the candlelight, she concluded that yes, he would harm his own daughter.\n But then, Annal¨ªa thought as she rushed out of her room to meet him, she was ready to take that risk.\n After the ordeal of dinner was over, and Pascal had escorted her from the table, Annal¨ªa asked for permission to go to her room to rest for an hour. He assured her that she would need her rest for he had much to teach her at week\u0027s end, then leaned in to kiss her.\n When she dared to give him her cheek, patting his chest before turning toward the doorway, he chuckled behind her. \"Ah, Annal¨ªa,\" he sighed as she strolled from his sight.\n Once alone, she sprinted up the stairs to her room, then wedged a chair against the doorknob. She scrubbed her face with water before sitting at the mirrored vanity, staring blankly. She would become a shell of her old self under Pascal\u0027s \"tutelage.\"\n She\u0027d said six or half a dozen, but now that she knew Pascal, if she had to relinquish her innocence to one or the other, it would definitely be to MacCarrick. At least she wasn\u0027t personally aware of his atrocities.\n The general was more handsome than the Scot - more handsome than any man she\u0027d ever imagined - but it didn\u0027t matter. Next to Pascal\u0027s engaging smile, soft hands, and murderous impulses, the Highlander\u0027s scarred face, blunt speech, and aggression were practically seductive.\n And still the hours until her wedding kept creeping by. My wedding.\n People had wondered how she could be around Aleix and Mariette, so completely in love and devoted to each other and not crave her own marriage. It was because of their love that she couldn\u0027t. She\u0027d seen what God in heaven had had in mind for a man and a woman, had seen their fidelity to each other, and never would she have knowingly slighted herself with a loveless marriage.\n Especially not to the degree that I\u0027m about to... She couldn\u0027t think like that! She was able to help Aleix now. She had a value with which to bargain -\n Guns went off, their shots popping, making her jump. The lowbrow revelry of the deserters consisted of drunken yells and shooting pistols in the air. Adding insult to injury, her hair was curling, escaping its pins. She reached for her brush. She liked the clacking sound her bracelet made as she raised her arm, and the strokes across her hair were soothing.\n Her mind drifted again to thoughts of the Highlander. \"I\u0027ll no\u0027 work for you for anything less than you,\" he\u0027d said in that rumbling, gruff voice. Despicable man. She prayed Vitale would heed the last command she\u0027d given before riding away - that he stay clear of him. She wished she had.... She froze, the brush halting in midstroke.\n On that night in the study, had MacCarrick said he\u0027d seen her hair? He had! Her hair and the other treasures she\u0027d hidden.\n She slammed down the brush. The only place she wore it loose was in the bedroom. MacCarrick had spied on her while she slept! Why would she expect anything different from an ill-mannered ogre like him? He would always do what he wanted regardless of other people\u0027s desires and without respect for their feelings.\n Annal¨ªa was sick and tired of men running roughshod over her. What about her wants? She hated having no control. She confined her hair more tightly than usual, then adjusted her choker, tightening it, still furious -\n Something scraped outside near her window. The music trilled on, punctuated by shots, but she thought she heard a noise coming from just below the sash. Maybe the breeze had stirred a lantern.\n A huge boot slipped in through the window, followed by a man unfolding to his full height. She scrambled to her feet. \"I know you! You were with MacCarrick.\" He was the oldest one. \"Tell me why you\u0027re here or I\u0027ll scream!\"\n Another followed him into the room. Oh, not the whelp!\n \"We\u0027re here to take you to safety, lass,\" the first said as he advanced on her. \"And you ken they canna hear you scream.\"\n \"To hell with you both!\" Mercenaries! Bloody, cursed mercenaries. Taking her to safety, her foot! When the young one captured her wrist she screeched, \"Why can\u0027t you all just leave me alone?\" then lashed out, her nails and teeth bared.\n \"Ach, Gavin!\" he exclaimed, releasing her. \"She bit me. I say we tie the little witch!\"\n \"No, no, son, let me handle - Bloody hell! She got me, too! And he forced this task on us to avoid the fighting?\" Gavin muttered angrily as he reached for her again. \"Lass, we will no\u0027 hurt you, you ken? We\u0027re saving you.\"\n \"If I leave here, you\u0027re condemning my brother!\" She kicked at his legs, but her skirts got in the way. \"So I\u0027m not leaving!\" When he seized her wrists she struck wildly, yet it was only a matter of time. To her fury, he bound her hands.\n \"Listen - MacCarrick is checking the jail for him right now. If he\u0027s there you\u0027ll both be freed and we\u0027ll take you to a safe place.\"\n Her stomach roiled. \"But he\u0027s not in the jail!\"\n Gavin frowned at that. \"Truly?\" he asked as he forced a gag on her. \"Well, we\u0027ll, uh, we\u0027ll let Court figure this one out.\"\n She shouted against the gag and swung her bound hands at him, but he deflected the blow.\n \"Liam!\" - he jerked his chin at her traveling bags - \"Grab those and stow some clothes.\"\n Liam set to work punching ball gowns and lace and stockings without a care.\n She shook her head forcefully and spoke against the cloth. Idiot! Pascal would kill him!\n \"Ach, wee one, we will no\u0027 treat you poorly. Everything will work out as it should,\" Gavin assured her, as he tossed her over his shoulder.\n She dug her nails into his back with every ounce of frustration she felt. When he tensed but continued on, she screamed in fury yet only heard a pitiful, muffled sound. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-9.html","bookId":2644,"book":{"id":2644,"title":"If You Dare (MacCarrick Brothers #1)","description":"Storyline: \n If You Dare (MacCarrick Brothers #1) \n Kresley Cole introduces a thrilling new romance trilogy featuring fierce Scottish brothers with dangerous lives, dark desires, and a deadly curse. \n Can he exact revenge? \n High in the Pyrenees, a band of mercenaries led by Courtland MacCarrick wages war for General Reynaldo Pascal.
