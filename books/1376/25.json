{"id":36793,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. \"MR. GRIFFENBOTTOM.\"","content":"On Monday, the 16th of October, Sir Thomas Underwood went down to Percycross, and the first information given him was that Mr. Westmacott and Ontario Moggs had arrived on the Saturday, and were already at work. Mr. Griffenbottom was expected early on the Tuesday. \"They\u0027ve stolen a march on us, then,\" said Sir Thomas to Mr. Trigger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Give \u0027em rope enough, and they\u0027ll hang themselves,\" replied the managing agent. \"There was Moggs spouting to them on his own hook on Saturday night, and Westmacott\u0027s chaps are ready to eat him. And he wanted to be doing it yesterday, Sunday; only some of them got a hold of him and wouldn\u0027t let him loose. Moggs is a great card for us, Sir Thomas. There\u0027s nothing like one of them spouting fellows to overset the coach.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Westmacott is fond of that too,\" said Sir Thomas. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He understands. He\u0027s used to it. He does it in the proper place. Westmacott wasn\u0027t a bad member for the place;—wasn\u0027t perhaps quite free enough with his money, but Westmacott was very decent.\" Sir Thomas could not help feeling that Trigger spoke of it as though he wished that the two old members might be returned. Ah, well! had it been possible, Mr. Trigger would have wished it. Mr. Trigger understood the borough, knew well the rocks before them, and would have wished it,—although he had been so imperative with Mr. Griffenbottom as to the second conservative candidate. And now Mr. Griffenbottom had sent them a man who would throw all the fat in the fire by talking of purity of election! \"And Moggs has been making a fool of himself in another direction,\" said Trigger, thinking that no opportunity for giving a valuable hint should be lost. \"He\u0027s been telling the working men already that they\u0027ll be scoundrels and knaves if they take so much as a glass of beer without paying for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Scoundrel is a strong word,\" said Sir Thomas, \"but I like him for that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Percycross won\u0027t like him. Men would rather have all that left to their own feelings. They who want beer or money certainly won\u0027t thank him; and they who don\u0027t want it don\u0027t like to be suspected.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Every one will take it as addressed to his neighbour and not to himself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We are very fond of our neighbours here, Sir Thomas, and that kind of thing won\u0027t go down.\" This was on the evening of the candidate\u0027s arrival, and the conversation was going on absolutely while Sir Thomas was eating his dinner. He had asked Mr. Trigger to join him, and Mr. Trigger had faintly alleged that he had dined at three; but he soon so far changed his mind as to be able to express an opinion that he could \"pick a bit,\" and he did pick a bit. After which he drank the best part of a bottle of port,—having assured Sir Thomas that the port at the Percy Standard was a sort of wine that one didn\u0027t get every day. And as he drank his port, he continued to pour in lessons of wisdom. Sir Thomas employed his mind the while in wondering when Mr. Trigger would go away, and forecasting whether Mr. Trigger would desire to drink port wine at the Percy Standard every evening during the process of canvassing. About nine o\u0027clock the waiter announced that a few gentlemen below desired to see Sir Thomas. \"Our friends,\" said Mr. Trigger. \"Just put chairs, and bring a couple of bottles of port, John. I\u0027m glad they\u0027re come, Sir Thomas, because it shows that they mean to take to you.\" Up they were shown, Messrs. Spiveycomb, Spicer, Pile, Roodylands,—the bootmaker who has not yet been named,—Pabsby, and seven or eight others. Sir Thomas shook hands with them all. He observed that Mr. Trigger was especially cordial in his treatment of Spicer, the mustard-maker,—as to whose defection he had been so fearful in consequence of certain power which Mr. Westmacott might have in the wholesale disposal of mustard. \"I hope you find yourself better,\" said Mr. Pile, opening the conversation. Sir Thomas assured his new friend that he was pretty well. \"\u0027Cause you seemed rayther down on your luck when you was here before,\" said Mr. Pile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No need for that,\" said Spicer, the man of mustard. \"Is there, Trigger?\" Trigger sat a little apart, with one bottle of port wine at his elbow, and took no part in the conversation. He was aware that his opportunities were so great that the outside supporters ought to have their time. \"Any objection to this, Sir Thomas?\" he said, taking a cigar-case out of his pocket. Sir Thomas, who hated tobacco, of course gave permission. Trigger rang the bell, ordered cigars for the party, and then sat apart with his port wine. In ten minutes Sir Thomas hardly knew where he was, so dense was the cloud of smoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir Thomas,\" began Mr. Pabsby,—\"if I could only clearly see my way—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll see it clear enough before nomination-day,\" said Mr. Pile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Any ways, after election,\" said a conservative grocer. Both these gentlemen belonged to the Established Church and delighted in snubbing Mr. Pabsby. Indeed, Mr. Pabsby had no business at this meeting, and so he had been told very plainly by one or two as he had joined them in the street. He explained, however, that his friend Sir Thomas had come to him the very first person in Percycross, and he carried his point in joining the party. But he was a mild man, and when he was interrupted he merely bided another opportunity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope, Sir Thomas, your mind is made up to do something for our trade,\" said Mr. Roodylands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter with your trade?\" said Spiveycomb, the paper-maker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well;—we ain\u0027t got no jobs in it;—that\u0027s the matter,\" said Mr. Pile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As for jobs, what\u0027s the odds?\" said a big and burly loud-mouthed tanner. \"All on us likes a good thing when it comes in our way. Stow that, and don\u0027t let\u0027s be told about jobs. Sir Thomas, here\u0027s your health, and I wish you at the top of the poll,—that is, next to Mr. Griffenbottom.\" Then they all drank to Sir Thomas\u0027s health, Mr. Pabsby filling himself a bumper for the occasion. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was eleven before they went away, at which time Mr. Pabsby had three times got as far as a declaration of his wish to see things clearly. Further than this he could not get; but still he went away in perfect good humour. He would have another opportunity, as he took occasion to whisper when he shook hands with the candidate. Trigger stayed even yet for half-an-hour. \"Don\u0027t waste your time on that fellow, Pabsby,\" he said. \"No, I won\u0027t,\" said Sir Thomas. \"And be very civil to old Pile.\" \"He doesn\u0027t seem disposed to return the compliment,\" said Sir Thomas. \"But he doesn\u0027t want your interest in the borough,\" said Trigger, with the air of a man who had great truths to teach. \"In electioneering, Sir Thomas, it\u0027s mostly the same as in other matters. Nothing\u0027s to be had for nothing. If you were a retail seller of boots from Manchester old Pile would be civil enough to you. You may snub Spicer as much as you please, because he\u0027ll expect to get something out of you.\" \"He\u0027ll be very much deceived,\" said Sir Thomas. \"I\u0027m not so sure of that,\" said Trigger;—\"Spicer knows what he\u0027s about pretty well.\" Then, at last, Mr. Trigger went, assuring Sir Thomas most enthusiastically that he would be with him before nine the next morning. \\n\\n \\n\\n Many distressing thoughts took possession of Sir Thomas as he lay in bed. He had made up his mind that he would in no way break the law, and he didn\u0027t know whether he had not broken it already by giving these people tobacco and wine. And yet it would have been impossible for him to have refused Mr. Trigger permission to order the supply. Even for the sake of the seat,—even for the sake of his reputation, which was so much dearer to him than the seat,—he could not have bidden guests, who had come to him in his own room, to go elsewhere if they required wine. It was a thing not to be done, and yet, for aught he knew, Mr. Trigger might continue to order food and wine, and beer and tobacco, to be supplied ad libitum, and whenever he chose. How was he to put an end to it, otherwise than by throwing up the game, and going back to London? That now would be gross ill-usage to the Conservatives of Percycross, who by such a step would be left in the lurch without a candidate. And then was it to be expected that he should live for a week with Mr. Trigger, with no other relief than that which would be afforded by Messrs. Pile, Spiveycomb, and Co. Everything about him was reeking of tobacco. And then, when he sat down to breakfast at nine o\u0027clock there would be Mr. Trigger! \\n\\n \\n\\n The next morning he was out of bed at seven, and ordered his breakfast at eight sharp. He would steal a march on Trigger. He went out into the sitting-room, and there was Trigger already seated in the arm-chair, studying the list of the voters of Percycross! Heavens, what a man! \"I thought I\u0027d look in early, and they told me you were coming out or I\u0027d have just stepped into your room.\" Into his very bed-room! Sir Thomas shuddered as he heard the proposition. \"We\u0027ve a telegram from Griffenbottom,\" continued Trigger, \"and he won\u0027t be here till noon. We can\u0027t begin till he comes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah;—then I can just write a few letters,\" said Sir Thomas. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t mind letters now if I was you. If you don\u0027t mind, we\u0027ll go and look up the parsons. There are four or five of \u0027em, and they like to be seen;—not in the way of canvassing. They\u0027re all right, of course. And there\u0027s two of \u0027em won\u0027t leave a stone unturned in the outside hamlets. But they like to be seen, and their wives like it.\" Whereupon Mr. Trigger ordered breakfast,—and eat it. Sir Thomas reminded himself that a fortnight was after all but a short duration of time. He might live through a fortnight,—probably,—and then when Mr. Griffenbottom came it would be shared between two. \\n\\n \\n\\n At noon he returned to the Percy Standard, very tired, there to await the coming of Mr. Griffenbottom. Mr. Griffenbottom didn\u0027t come till three, and then bustled up into the sitting-room, which Sir Thomas had thought was his own, as though all Percycross belonged to him. During the last three hours supporters had been in and out continually, and Mr. Pabsby had made an ineffectual attempt or two to catch Sir Thomas alone. Trigger had been going up and down between the Standard and the station. Various men, friends and supporters of Griffenbottom and Underwood, had been brought to him. Who were paid agents, who were wealthy townsmen, who were canvassers and messengers, he did not know. There were bottles on the sideboard the whole time. Sir Thomas, in a speculative manner, endeavouring to realise to himself the individuality of this and that stranger, could only conceive that they who helped themselves were wealthy townsmen, and that they who waited till they were asked by others were paid canvassers and agents. But he knew nothing, and could only wish himself back in Southampton Buildings. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last Mr. Griffenbottom, followed by a cloud of supporters, bustled into the room. Trigger at once introduced the two candidates. \"Very glad to meet you,\" said Griffenbottom. \"So we\u0027re going to fight this little battle together. I remember you in the House, you know, and I dare say you remember me. I\u0027m used to this kind of thing. I suppose you ain\u0027t. Well, Trigger, how are things looking? I suppose we\u0027d better begin down Pump Lane. I know my way about the place, Honeywood, as well as if it was my bed-room. And so I ought, Trigger.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose you\u0027ve seen the inside of pretty nearly every house in Percycross,\" said Trigger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s some I don\u0027t want to see the inside of any more. I can tell you that. How are these new householders going to vote?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Betwixt and between, Mr. Griffenbottom.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never thought we should find much difference. It don\u0027t matter what rent a man pays, but what he does. I could tell you how nineteen out of twenty men here would vote, if you\u0027d tell me what they did, and who they were. What\u0027s to be done about talking to \u0027em?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To-morrow night we\u0027re to be in the Town Hall, Mr. Griffenbottom, and Thursday an open-air meeting, with a balcony in the market-place.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right. Come along. Are you good at spinning yarns to them, Honeywood?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like it, if you mean that,\" said Sir Thomas. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s better than canvassing. By George, anything is better than that. Come along. We may get Pump Lane, and Petticoat Yard, and those back alleys done before dinner. You\u0027ve got cards, of course, Trigger.\" And the old, accustomed electioneerer led the way out to his work. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Griffenbottom was a heavy hale man, over sixty, somewhat inclined to be corpulent, with a red face, and a look of assured impudence about him which nothing could quell or diminish. The kind of life which he had led was one to which impudence was essentially necessary. He had done nothing for the world to justify him in assuming the airs of a great man,—but still he could assume them, and many believed in him. He could boast neither birth, nor talent, nor wit,—nor, indeed, wealth in the ordinary sense of the word. Though he had worked hard all his life at the business to which he belonged, he was a poorer man now than he had been thirty years ago. It had all gone in procuring him a seat in Parliament. And he had so much sense that he never complained. He had known what it was that he wanted, and what it was that he must pay for it. He had paid for it, and had got it, and was, in his fashion, contented. If he could only have continued to have it without paying for it again, how great would have been the blessing! But he was a man who knew that such blessings were not to be expected. After the first feeling of disgust was over on the receipt of Trigger\u0027s letter, he put his collar to the work again, and was prepared to draw his purse,—intending, of course, that the new candidate should bear as much as possible of this drain. He knew well that there was a prospect before him of abject misery;—for life without Parliament would be such to him. There would be no salt left for him in the earth if he was ousted. And yet no man could say why he should have cared to sit in Parliament. He rarely spoke, and when he did no one listened to him. He was anxious for no political measures. He was a favourite with no section of a party. He spent all his evenings at the House, but it can hardly be imagined that those evenings were pleasantly spent. But he rubbed his shoulders against the shoulders of great men, and occasionally stood upon their staircases. At any rate, such as was the life, it was his life; and he had no time left to choose another. He considered himself on this occasion pretty nearly sure to be elected. He knew the borough and was sure. But then there was that accursed system of petitioning, which according to his idea was un-English, ungentlemanlike, and unpatriotic—\"A stand-up fight, and if you\u0027re licked—take it.\" That was his idea of what an election should be. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir Thomas, who only just remembered the appearance of the man in the House, at once took an extravagant dislike to him. It was abominable to him to be called Underwood by a man who did not know him. It was nauseous to him to be forced into close relations with a man who seemed to him to be rough and ill-mannered. And, judging from what he saw, he gave his colleague credit for no good qualities. Now Mr. Griffenbottom had good qualities. He was possessed of pluck. He was in the main good-natured. And though he could resent an offence with ferocity, he could forgive an offence with ease. \"Hit him hard, and then have an end of it!\" That was Mr. Griffenbottom\u0027s mode of dealing with the offenders and the offences with which he came in contact. \\n\\n \\n\\n In every house they entered Griffenbottom was at home, and Sir Thomas was a stranger of whom the inmates had barely heard the name. Griffenbottom was very good at canvassing the poorer classes. He said not a word to them about politics, but asked them all whether they didn\u0027t dislike that fellow Gladstone, who was one thing one day and another thing another day. \"By G——, nobody knows what he is,\" swore Mr. Griffenbottom over and over again. The women mostly said that they didn\u0027t know, but they liked the blue. \"Blues allays was gallanter nor the yellow,\" said one of \u0027em. They who expressed an opinion at all hoped that their husbands would vote for him, \"as \u0027d do most for \u0027em.\" \"The big loaf;—that\u0027s what we want,\" said one mother of many children, taking Sir Thomas by the hand. There were some who took advantage of the occasion to pour out their tales of daily griefs into the ears of their visitors. To these Griffenbottom was rather short and hard. \"What we want, my dear, is your husband\u0027s vote and interest. We\u0027ll hear all the rest another time.\" Sir Thomas would have lingered and listened; but Griffenbottom knew that 1,400 voters had to be visited in ten days, and work as they would they could not see 140 a day. Trigger explained it all to Sir Thomas. \"You can\u0027t work above seven hours, and you can\u0027t do twenty an hour. And much of the ground you must do twice over. If you stay to talk to them you might as well be in London. Mr. Griffenbottom understands it so well, you\u0027d better keep your eye on him.\" There could be no object in the world on which Sir Thomas was less desirous of keeping his eye. \\n\\n \u0027The big loaf;--that\u0027s what we want,\u0027 said one mother of many children, taking Sir Thomas by the hand. \\n\\n \"The big loaf;--that\u0027s what we want,\" said one mother \\n\\n of many children, taking Sir Thomas by the hand. \\n\\n Click to ENLARGE \\n\\n \\n\\n The men, who were much more difficult to find than the women, had generally less to say for themselves. Most of them understood at once what was wanted, and promised. For it must be understood that on this their first day the conservative brigade was moving among its firm friends. In Petticoat Yard lived paper-makers in the employment of Mr. Spiveycomb, and in Pump Lane the majority of the inhabitants were employed by Mr. Spicer, of the mustard works. The manufactories of both these men were visited, and there the voters were booked much quicker than at the rate of twenty an hour. Here and there a man would hold some peculiar opinion of his own. The Permissive Bill was asked for by an energetic teetotaller; and others, even in these Tory quarters, suggested the ballot. But they all,—or nearly all of them,—promised their votes. Now and again some sturdy fellow, seeming to be half ashamed of himself in opposing all those around him, would say shortly that he meant to vote for Moggs, and pass on. \"You do,—do you?\" Sir Thomas heard Mr. Spicer say to one such man. \"Yes, I does,\" said the man. Sir Thomas heard no more, but he felt how perilous was the position on which a candidate stood under the present law. \\n\\n \\n\\n As regarded Sir Thomas himself, he felt, as the evening was coming on, that he had hardly done his share of the work. Mr. Griffenbottom had canvassed, and he had walked behind. Every now and then he had attempted a little conversation, but in that he had been immediately pulled up by the conscientious and energetic Mr. Trigger. As for asking for votes, he hardly knew, when he had been carried back into the main street through a labyrinth of alleys at the back of Petticoat Yard, whether he had asked any man for his vote or not. With the booking of the votes he had, of course, nothing to do. There were three men with books;—and three other men to open the doors, show the way, and make suggestions on the expediency of going hither or thither. Sir Thomas would always have been last in the procession, had there not been one silent, civil person, whose duty it seemed to be to bring up the rear. If ever Sir Thomas lingered behind to speak to a poor woman, there was this silent, civil person lingering too. The influence of the silent, civil person was so strong that Sir Thomas could not linger much. \\n\\n \\n\\n As they came into the main street they encountered the opposition party, Mr. Westmacott, Ontario Moggs, and their supporters. \"I\u0027ll introduce you,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom to his colleague. \"Come along. It\u0027s the thing to do.\" Then they met in the middle of the way. Poor Ontario was hanging behind, but holding up his head gallantly, and endeavouring to look as though he were equal to the occasion. Griffenbottom and Westmacott shook hands cordially, and complained with mutual sighs that household suffrage had made the work a deal harder than ever. \"And I\u0027m only a week up from the gout,\" said Griffenbottom. Then Sir Thomas and Westmacott were introduced, and at last Ontario was brought forward. He bowed and attempted to make a little speech; but nobody in one army or in the other seemed to care much for poor Ontario. He knew that it was so, but that mattered little to him. If he were destined to represent Percycross in Parliament, it must be by the free votes and unbiassed political aspirations of the honest working men of the borough. So remembering he stood aloof, stuck his hand into his breast, and held up his head something higher than before. Though the candidates had thus greeted each other at this chance meeting, the other parties in the contending armies had exhibited no courtesies. \\n\\n \\n\\n The weariness of Sir Thomas when this first day\u0027s canvass was over was so great that he was tempted to go to bed and ask for a bowl of gruel. Nothing kept him from doing so but amazement at the courage and endurance of Mr. Griffenbottom. \"We could get at a few of those chaps who were at the works, if we went out at eight,\" said Griffenbottom. Trigger suggested that Mr. Griffenbottom would be very tired. Trigger himself was perhaps tired. \"Oh, tired,\" said Griffenbottom; \"a man has to be tired at this work.\" Sir Thomas perceived that Griffenbottom was at least ten years his senior, and that he was still almost lame from the gout. \"You\u0027ll be ready, Underwood?\" said Griffenbottom. Sir Thomas felt himself bound to undertake whatever might be thought necessary. \"If we were at it day and night, it wouldn\u0027t be too much,\" said Griffenbottom, as he prepared to amuse himself with one of the poll-books till dinner should be on the table. \"Didn\u0027t we see Jacob Pucky?\" asked the energetic candidate, observing that the man\u0027s name wasn\u0027t marked. \"To be sure we did. I was speaking to him myself. He was one of those who didn\u0027t know till the day came. We know what that means; eh, Honeywood?\" Sir Thomas wasn\u0027t quite sure that he did know; but he presumed that it meant something dishonest. Again Mr. Trigger dined with them, and as soon as ever their dinner was swallowed they were out again at their work, Sir Thomas being dragged from door to door, while Griffenbottom asked for the votes. \\n\\n \\n\\n And this was to last yet for ten days more! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2745/75612.html","bookId":1376,"book":{"id":1376,"title":"Ralph the Heir","description":"简介： There are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there are also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise.
