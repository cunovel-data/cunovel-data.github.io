{"id":36820,"no":52,"title":"CHAPTER LII. GUS EARDHAM.","content":"Whether Mr. Neefit broke Ralph Newton\u0027s little statuette,—a miniature copy in porcelain of the Apollo Belvidere, which stood in a corner of Ralph\u0027s room, and in the possession of which he took some pride,—from awkwardness in his wrath or of malice prepense, was never known. He told the servant that he had whisked it down with his coat tails; but Ralph always thought that the breeches-maker had intended to make a general ruin, but had been cowed by the noise of his first attack. He did, at any rate, abstain from breaking other things, and when the servant entered the room, condescended to make some careless apology. \"A trifle like that ain\u0027t nothing between me and your master, Jack,\" said Mr. Neefit, after accounting for the accident by his coat-tails. \n \n \"I am not Jack,\" said the indignant valet, with a strong foreign accent. \"I am named—Adolphe.\" \n \n \"Adolphe, are you? I don\u0027t think much of Adolphe for a name;—but it ain\u0027t no difference to me. Just pick up them bits; will you?\" \n \n The man turned a look of scorn on Mr. Neefit, and did pick up the bits. He intended to obey his master as far as might be possible, but was very unwilling to wait upon the breeches-maker. He felt that the order which had been given to him was very cruel. It was his duty,—and his pleasure to wait upon gentlemen; but this man he knew to be a tradesman who measured customers for hunting apparel in his own shop. It was hard upon him that his master should go and leave him to be insulted, ordered about, and trodden upon by a breeches-maker. \"Get me a bit of steak, will you?\" demanded Neefit;—\"a bit of the rump, not too much done, with the gravy in it,—and an onion. What are you staring at? Didn\u0027t you hear what your master said to you?\" \n \n \"Onion,—and romp-steak!\" \n \n \"Yes; rump-steak and onion. I ain\u0027t going out of this till I\u0027ve had a bit of grub. Your master knows all about it. I\u0027m going to have more nor that out of him before I\u0027ve done with him.\" \n \n Neefit did at last succeed, and had his rump-steak and onion, together with more brandy and soda-water, eating and drinking as he sat in Ralph\u0027s beautiful new easy chair,—not very much to his own comfort. A steak at the Prince\u0027s Feathers in Conduit Street would have been very much more pleasant to him, and he would have preferred half-and-half in the pewter to brandy and soda-water;—but he felt a pride in using his power in a fashion that would be disgraceful to his host. When he had done his steak he pulled his pipe out of his pocket, and smoked. Against this Adolphe remonstrated stoutly, but quite in vain. \"The Captain won\u0027t mind a little baccy-smoke out of my pipe,\" he said. \"He always has his smoke comfortable when he comes down to me.\" At last, about four o\u0027clock, he did go away, assuring Adolphe that he would repeat his visit very soon. \"I means to see a deal of the Captain this season,\" he said. At last, however, he retreated, and Adolphe opened the door of the house for him without speaking a word. \"Bye, bye,\" said Neefit. \"I\u0027ll be here again before long.\" \n \n Ralph on that afternoon came home to dress for dinner at about seven, in great fear lest Neefit should still be found in his rooms. \"No, saar; he go away at last!\" said Adolphe, with a melancholy shake of his head. \n \n \"Has he done much harm?\" \n \n \"The Apollo gone!—and he had romp-steak,—and onions,—and a pipe. Vat vas I to do? I hope he vill never come again.\" And so also did Mr. Newton hope that Neefit would never come again. \n \n He was going to dine with Lady Eardham, the wife of a Berkshire baronet, who had three fair daughters. At this period of his life he found the aristocracy of Berkshire and Hampshire to be very civil to him; and, indeed, the world at large was disposed to smile on him. But there was very much in his lot to make him unhappy. He had on that morning been utterly rejected by Clarissa Underwood. It may, perhaps, be true that he was not a man to break his heart because a girl rejected him. He was certainly one who could have sung the old song, \"If she be not fair for me, what care I how fair she be.\" And yet Clarissa\u0027s conduct had distressed him, and had caused him to go about throughout the whole afternoon with his heart almost in his boots. He had felt her coldness to him much more severely than he had that of Mary Bonner. He had taught himself to look upon that little episode with Mary as though it had really meant nothing. She had just crossed the sky of his heaven like a meteor, and for a moment had disturbed its serenity. And Polly also had been to him a false light, leading him astray for awhile under exceptional, and, as he thought, quite pardonable circumstances. But dear little Clary had been his own peculiar star,—a star that was bound to have been true to him, even though he might have erred for a moment in his worship,—a star with a sweet, soft, enduring light, that he had always assured himself he might call his own when he pleased. And now this soft, sweet star had turned upon him and scorched him. \"When I get home,\" she had said to him, \"I shall find that you have already made an offer to Patience!\" He certainly had not expected such scorn from her. And then he was so sure in his heart that if she would have accepted him, he would have been henceforth so true to her, so good to her! He would have had such magnanimous pleasure in showering upon her pretty little head all the good things at his disposal, that, for her own sake, the pity was great. When he had been five minutes in his cab, bowling back towards his club, he was almost minded to return and give her one more chance. She would just have suited him. And as for her,—would it not be a heaven on earth for her if she would only consent to forget that foolish, unmeaning little episode. Could Clary have forgotten the episode, and been content to care little or nothing for that easiness of feeling which made our Ralph what he was, she might, probably, have been happy as the mistress of the Priory. But she would not have forgotten, and would not have been content. She had made up her little heart stoutly that Ralph the heir should sit in it no longer, and it was well for him that he did not go back. \n \n He went to his club instead,—not daring to go to his rooms. The insanity of Neefit was becoming to him a terrible bane. It was, too, a cruelty which he certainly had done nothing to deserve. He could lay his hand on his heart and assure himself that he had treated that mad, pig-headed tradesman well in all respects. He knew himself to be the last man to make a promise, and then to break it wilfully. He had certainly borrowed money of Neefit;—and at the probable cost of all his future happiness he had, with a nobleness which he could not himself sufficiently admire, done his very best to keep the hard terms which in his distress he had allowed to be imposed upon himself. He had been loyal, even to the breeches-maker;—and this was the return which was made to him! \n \n What was he to do, should Neefit cling to his threat and remain permanently at his chambers? There were the police, and no doubt he could rid himself of his persecutor. But he understood well the barbarous power which some underbred, well-trained barrister would have of asking him questions which it would be so very disagreeable for him to answer! He lacked the courage to send for the police. Jacky Joram had just distinguished himself greatly, and nearly exterminated a young gentleman who had married one girl while he was engaged to another. Jacky Joram might ask him questions as to his little dinners at Alexandra Lodge, which it would nearly kill him to answer. He was very unhappy, and began to think that it might be as well that he should travel for twelve months. Neefit could not persecute him up the Nile, or among the Rocky Mountains. And perhaps Clary\u0027s ferocity would have left her were he to return after twelve months of glorious journeyings, still constant to his first affections. In the meantime he did not dare to go home till it would be absolutely necessary that he should dress for dinner. \n \n In the billiard-room of his club he found Lord Polperrow,—the eldest son of the Marquis of Megavissey,—pretty Poll, as he was called by many young men, and by some young ladies, about town. Lord Polperrow had become his fast friend since the day on which his heirship was established, and now encountered him with friendly intimacy. \"Halloa, Newton,\" said the young lord, \"have you seen old Neefit lately?\" There were eight or ten men in the room, and suddenly there was silence among the cues. \n \n Ralph would have given his best horse to be able to laugh it off, but he found that he could not laugh. He became very hot, and knew that he was red in the face. \"What about old Neefit?\" he said. \n \n \"I\u0027ve just come from Conduit Street, and he says that he has been dining with you. He swears that you are to marry his daughter.\" \n \n \"He be d——!\" said Newton. It was a poor way of getting out of the scrape, and so Ralph felt. \n \n \"But what\u0027s the meaning of it all? He\u0027s telling everybody about London that you went down to stay with him at Margate.\" \n \n \"Neefit has gone mad lately,\" said Captain Fooks, with a good-natured determination to stand by his friend in misfortune. \n \n \"But how about the girl, Newton?\" asked his lordship. \n \n \"You may have her yourself, Poll,—if she don\u0027t prefer a young shoemaker, to whom I believe she\u0027s engaged. She\u0027s very pretty, and has got a lot of money—which will suit you to a T.\" He tried to put a good face on it; but, nevertheless, he was very hot and red in the face. \n \n \"I\u0027d put a stop to this if I were you,\" said another friend, confidentially and in a whisper. \"He\u0027s not only telling everybody, but writing letters about it.\" \n \n \"Oh, I know,\" said Ralph. \"How can I help what a madman does? It\u0027s a bore of course.\" Then he sauntered out again, feeling sure that his transactions with Mr. Neefit would form the subject of conversation in the club billiard-room for the next hour and a half. It would certainly become expedient that he should travel abroad. \n \n He felt it to be quite a relief when he found that Mr. Neefit was not waiting for him at his chambers. \"Adolphe,\" he said as soon as he was dressed, \"that man must never be allowed to put his foot inside the door again.\" \n \n \"Ah;—the Apollo gone! And he did it express!\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t mind the figure;—but he must never be allowed to enter the place again. I shall not stay up long, but while we are here you must not leave the place till six. He won\u0027t come in the evening.\" Then he put a sovereign into the man\u0027s hand, and went out to dine at Lady Eardham\u0027s. \n \n Lady Eardham had three fair daughters, with pretty necks, and flaxen hair, and blue eyes, and pug noses, all wonderfully alike. They ranged from twenty-seven to twenty-one, there being sons between,—and it began to be desirable that they should be married. Since Ralph had been in town the Eardham mansion in Cavendish Square had been opened to him with almost maternal kindness. He had accepted the kindness; but being fully alive to the purposes of matronly intrigue, had had his little jokes in reference to the young ladies. He liked young ladies generally, but was well aware that a young man is not obliged to offer his hand and heart to every girl that is civil to him. He and the Eardham girls had been exceedingly intimate, but he had had no idea whatever of sharing Newton Priory with an Eardham. Now, however, in his misery he was glad to go to a house in which he would be received with an assured welcome. \n \n Everybody smiled upon him. Sir George in these days was very cordial, greeting him with that genial esoteric warmth which is always felt by one English country gentleman with a large estate for another equally blessed. Six months ago, when it was believed that Ralph had sold his inheritance to his uncle, Sir George when he met the young man addressed him in a very different fashion. As he entered the room he felt the warmth of the welcoming. The girls, one and all, had ever so many things to say to him. They all hunted, and they all wanted him to look at horses for them. Lady Eardham was more matronly than ever, and at the same time was a little fussy. She would not leave him among the girls, and at last succeeded in getting him off into a corner of the back drawing-room. \"Now, Mr. Newton,\" she said, \"I am going to show you that I put the greatest confidence in you.\" \n \n \"So you may,\" said Ralph, wondering whether one of the girls was to be offered to him, out of hand. At the present moment he was so low in spirits that he would probably have taken either. \n \n \"I have had a letter,\" said Lady Eardham, whispering the words into his ear;—and then she paused. \"Such a strange letter, and very abominable. I\u0027ve shown it to no one,—not even to Sir George. I wouldn\u0027t let one of the girls see it for ever so much.\" Then there was another pause. \"I don\u0027t believe a word of it, Mr. Newton; but I think it right to show it to you,—because it\u0027s about you.\" \n \n \"About me?\" said Ralph, with his mind fixed at once upon Mr. Neefit. \n \n \"Yes, indeed;—and when I tell you it refers to my girls too, you will see how strong is my confidence in you. If either had been specially named, of course I could not have shown it.\" Then she handed him the letter, which poor Ralph read, as follows:— \n \n \n My Lady,—I\u0027m told as Mr. Ralph Newton, of Newton Priory, is sweet upon one of your ladyship\u0027s daughters. I think it my duty to tell your ladyship he\u0027s engaged to marry my girl, Maryanne Neefit. \n \n Yours most respectful, \n \n Thomas Neefit, \n Breeches-Maker, Conduit Street. \n \n \n \"It\u0027s a lie,\" said Ralph. \n \n \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s a lie,\" said Lady Eardham, \"only I thought it right to show it you.\" \n \n Ralph took Gus Eardham down to dinner, and did his very best to make himself agreeable. Gus was the middle one of the three, and was certainly a fine girl. The Eardham girls would have no money; but Ralph was not a greedy man,—except when he was in great need. It must not be supposed, however, that on this occasion he made up his mind to marry Gus Eardham. But, as on previous occasions, he had been able to hold all the Eardhams in a kind of subjection to himself, feeling himself to be bigger than they,—as hitherto he had been conscious that he was bestowing and they receiving,—so now, in his present misfortune, did he recognise that Gus was a little bigger than himself, and that it was for her to give and for him to take. And Gus was able to talk to him as though she also entertained the same conviction. Gus was very kind to him, and he felt grateful to her. \n \n Lady Eardham saw Gus alone in her bedroom that night. \"I believe he\u0027s a very good young man,\" said Lady Eardham, \"if he\u0027s managed rightly. And as for all this about the horrid man\u0027s daughter, it don\u0027t matter at all. He\u0027d live it down in a month if he were married.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think anything about that, mamma. I dare say he\u0027s had his fun,—just like other men.\" \n \n \"Only, my dear, he\u0027s one of that sort that have to be fixed.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s so hard to fix them, mamma.\" \n \n \"It needn\u0027t be hard to fix him,—that is, if you\u0027ll only be steady. He\u0027s not sharp and hard and callous, like some of them. He doesn\u0027t mean any harm, and if he once speaks out, he isn\u0027t one that can\u0027t be kept to time. His manners are nice. I don\u0027t think the property is involved; but I\u0027ll find out from papa; and he\u0027s just the man to think his wife the pink of perfection.\" Lady Eardham had read our hero\u0027s character not inaccurately. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2745/75639.html","bookId":1376,"book":{"id":1376,"title":"Ralph the Heir","description":"简介： There are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there are also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise.
