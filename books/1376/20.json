{"id":36788,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. THE CONSERVATIVES OF PERCYCROSS.","content":"Early in this month of September there had come a proposition to Sir Thomas, which had thoroughly disturbed him, and made him for a few days a most miserable man. By the tenth of the month, however, he had so far recovered himself as to have made up his mind in regard to the proposition with some feeling of triumphant expectation. On the following day he went home to Fulham, and communicated his determination to his eldest daughter in the following words; \"Patience, I am going to stand for the borough of Percycross.\" \n \n \"Papa!\" \n \n \"Yes. I dare say I\u0027m a fool for my pains. It will cost me some money which I oughtn\u0027t to spend; and if I get in I don\u0027t know that I can do any good, or that it can do me any good. I suppose you think I\u0027m very wrong?\" \n \n \"I am delighted,—and so will Clary be. I\u0027m so much pleased! Why shouldn\u0027t you be in Parliament? I have always longed that you should go back to public life, though I have never liked to say so to you.\" \n \n \"It is very kind of you to say it now, my dear.\" \n \n \"And I feel it.\" There was no doubt of that, for, as she spoke, the tears were streaming from her eyes. \"But will you succeed? Is there to be anybody against you?\" \n \n \"Yes, my dear; there is to be somebody against me. In fact, there will be three people against me; and probably I shall not succeed. Men such as I am do not have seats offered to them without a contest. But there is a chance. I was down at Percycross for two days last week, and now I\u0027ve put out an address. There it is.\" Upon which he handed a copy of a placard to his daughter, who read it, no doubt, with more enthusiasm than did any of the free and independent electors to whom it was addressed. \n \n The story in regard to the borough of Percycross was as follows. There were going forward in the country at this moment preparations for a general election, which was to take place in October. The readers of this story have not as yet been troubled on this head, there having been no connection between that great matter and the small matters with which our tale has concerned itself. In the Parliament lately dissolved, the very old borough of Percycross,—or Percy St. Cross, as the place was properly called,—had displayed no political partiality, having been represented by two gentlemen, one of whom always followed the conservative leader, and the other the liberal leader, into the respective lobbies of the House of Commons. The borough had very nearly been curtailed of the privilege in regard to two members in the great Reform Bill which had been initiated and perfected and carried through as a whole by the almost unaided intellect and exertions of the great reformer of his age; but it had had its own luck, as the Irishmen say, and had been preserved intact. Now the wise men of Percycross, rejoicing in their salvation, and knowing that there might still be danger before them should they venture on a contest,—for bribery had not been unknown in previous contests at Percycross, nor petitions consequent upon bribery; and some men had marvelled that the borough should have escaped so long; and there was now supposed to be abroad a spirit of assumed virtue in regard to such matters under which Percycross might still be sacrificed if Percycross did not look very sharp after itself;—thinking of all this, the wise men at Percycross had concluded that it would be better, just for the present, to let things run smoothly, and to return their two old members. When the new broom which was to sweep up the dirt of corruption was not quite so new, they might return to the old game,—which was, in truth, a game very much loved in the old town of Percycross. So thought the wise men, and for a while it seemed that the wise men were to have their own way. But there were men at Percycross who were not wise, and who would have it that such an arrangement as this showed lack of spirit. The conservative foolish men at Percycross began by declaring that they could return two members for the borough if they pleased, and that they would do so, unless this and that were conceded to them. The liberal foolish men swore that they were ready for the battle. They would concede nothing, and would stand up and fight if the word concession were named to them. They would not only have one member, but would have half the aldermen, half the town-councillors, half the mayor, half the patronage in beadles, bell-ringers and bumbledom in general. Had the great reformer of the age given them household suffrage for nothing? The liberal foolish men of Percycross declared, and perhaps thought, that they could send two liberal members to Parliament. And so the borough grew hot. There was one very learned pundit in those parts, a pundit very learned in political matters, who thus prophesied to one of the proposed candidates;—\"You\u0027ll spend a thousand pounds in the election. You won\u0027t get in, of course, but you\u0027ll petition. That\u0027ll be another thousand. You\u0027ll succeed there, and disfranchise the borough. It will be a great career, and no doubt you\u0027ll find it satisfactory. You mustn\u0027t show yourself in Percycross afterwards;—that\u0027s all.\" But the spirit was afloat, and the words of the pundit were of no avail. The liberal spirit had been set a going, and men went to work with the new lists of borough voters. By the end of August it was seen that there must be a contest. But who should be the new candidates? \n \n The old candidates were there,—one on each side: an old Tory and a young Radical. In telling our tale we will not go back to the old sins of the borough, or say aught but good of the past career of the members. Old Mr. Griffenbottom, the Tory, had been very generous with his purse, and was beloved, doubtless, by many in the borough. It is so well for a borough to have some one who is always ready with a fifty-pound note in this or that need! It is so comfortable in a borough to know that it can always have its subscription lists well headed! And the young Radical was popular throughout the county. No one could take a chair at a mechanics\u0027 meeting with better grace or more alacrity, or spin out his half-hour\u0027s speech with greater ease and volubility. And then he was a born gentleman, which is so great a recommendation for a Radical. So that, in fact, young Mr. Westmacott, though he did not spend so much money as old Griffenbottom, was almost as popular in the borough. There was no doubt about Griffenbottom and Westmacott,—if only the borough would have listened to its wise men and confined itself to the political guardianship of such excellent representatives! But the foolish men prevailed over the wise men, and it was decided that there should be a contest. \n \n It was an evil day for Griffenbottom when it was suggested to him that he should bring a colleague with him. Griffenbottom knew what this meant almost as well as the learned pundit whose words we have quoted. Griffenbottom had not been blessed with uncontested elections, and had run through many perils. He had spent what he was accustomed to call, when speaking of his political position among his really intimate friends, \"a treasure\" in maintaining the borough. He must often have considered within himself whether his whistle was worth the price. He had petitioned and been petitioned against, and had had evil things said of him, and had gone through the very heat of the fire of political warfare. But he had kept his seat, and now at last,—so he thought,—the ease and comfort of an unopposed return was to repay him for everything. Alas! how all this was changed; how his spirits sank within him, when he received that high-toned letter from his confidential agent, Mr. Trigger, in which he was invited to suggest the name of a colleague! \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be rejoiced to hear, for the sake of the old borough,\" said Mr. Trigger, \"that we feel confident of carrying the two seats.\" Could Mr. Trigger have heard the remarks which his patron made on reading that letter, Mr. Trigger would have thought that Mr. Griffenbottom was the most ungrateful member of Parliament in the world. What did not Mr. Griffenbottom owe to the borough of Percycross? Did he not owe all his position in the world, all his friends, the fact that he was to be seen on the staircases of Cabinet Ministers, and that he was called \"honourable friend\" by the sons of dukes,—did he not owe it all to the borough of Percycross? Mr. Trigger and other friends of his, felt secure in their conviction that they had made a man of Mr. Griffenbottom. Mr. Griffenbottom understood enough of all this to answer Mr. Trigger without inserting in his letter any of those anathemas which he uttered in the privacy of his own closet. He did, indeed, expostulate, saying, that he would of course suggest a colleague, if a colleague were required; but did not Mr. Trigger and his other friends in the dear old borough think that just at the present moment a pacific line of action would be best for the interests of the dear old borough? Mr. Trigger answered him very quickly, and perhaps a little sharply. The Liberals had decided upon having two men in the field, and therefore a pacific line of action was no longer possible. Mr. Griffenbottom hurried over to the dear old borough, still hoping,—but could do nothing. The scent of the battle was in the air, and the foolish men of Percycross were keen for blood. Mr. Griffenbottom smiled and promised, and declared to himself that there was no peace for the politician on this side the grave. He made known his desires,—or the desire rather of the borough,—to a certain gentleman connected with a certain club in London, and the gentleman in question on the following day waited upon Sir Thomas. Sir Thomas had always been true \"to the party,\"—so the gentleman in question was good enough to say. Everybody had regretted the loss of Sir Thomas from the House. The present opportunity of returning to it was almost unparalleled, seeing that thing was so nearly a certainty. Griffenbottom had always been at the top of the poll, and the large majority of the new voters were men in the employment of conservative masters. The gentleman in question was very clear in his explanation that there was a complete understanding on this matter between the employers and employed at Percycross. It was the nature of the Percycross artizan to vote as his master voted. They made boots, mustard, and paper at Percycross. The men in the mustard and paper trade were quite safe;—excellent men, who went in a line to the poll, and voted just as the master paper-makers and master mustard-makers desired. The gentleman from the club acknowledged that there was a difficulty about the boot-trade. All the world over, boots do affect radical sentiments. The master bootmakers,—there were four in the borough,—were decided; but the men could not be got at with any certainty. \n \n \"Why should you wish to get at them?\" demanded Sir Thomas. \n \n \"No;—of course not; one doesn\u0027t wish to get at them,\" said the gentleman from the club,—\"particularly as we are safe without them.\" Then he went into statistics, and succeeded in proving to Sir Thomas that there would be a hard fight. Sir Thomas, who was much pressed as to time, took a day to consider. \"Did Mr. Griffenbottom intend to fight the battle with clean hands?\" The gentleman from the club was eager in declaring that everything would be done in strict accordance with the law. He could give no guarantee as to expenses, but presumed it would be about ￡300,—perhaps ￡400,—certainly under ￡500. The other party no doubt would bribe. They always did. And on their behalf,—on behalf of Westmacott and Co.,—there would be treating, and intimidation, and subornation, and fictitious voting, and every sin to which an election is subject. It always was so with the Liberals at Percycross. But Sir Thomas might be sure that on his side everything would be—\"serene.\" Sir Thomas at last consented to go down to Percycross, and see one or two of his proposed supporters. \n \n He did go down, and was considerably disgusted. Mr. Trigger took him in hand and introduced him to three or four gentlemen in the borough. Sir Thomas, in his first interview with Mr. Trigger, declared his predilection for purity. \"Yes, yes; yes, yes; of course,\" said Mr. Trigger. Mr. Trigger, seeing that Sir Thomas had come among them as a stranger to whom had been offered the very great honour of standing for the borough of Percycross,—offered to him before he had subscribed a shilling to any of the various needs of the borough,—was not disposed to listen to dictation. But Sir Thomas insisted. \"It\u0027s as well that we should understand each other at once,\" said Sir Thomas. \"I should throw up the contest in the middle of it,—even if I were winning,—if I suspected that money was being spent improperly.\" How often has the same thing been said by a candidate, and what candidate ever has thrown up the sponge when he was winning? Mr. Trigger was at first disposed to tell Sir Thomas that he was interfering in things beyond his province. Had it not been that the day was late, and that the Liberals were supposed to be hard at work,—that the candidate was wanted at once, Mr. Trigger would have shown his spirit. As it was he could only assent with a growl, and say that he had supposed all that was to be taken as a matter of course. \n \n \"But I desire to have it absolutely understood by all those who act with me in this matter,\" said Sir Thomas. \"At any rate I will not be petitioned against.\" \n \n \"Petitions never come to much at Percycross,\" said Mr. Trigger. He certainly ought to have known, as he had had to do with a great many of them. Then they started to call upon two or three of the leading conservative gentlemen. \"If I were you, I wouldn\u0027t say anything about that, Sir Thomas.\" \n \n \"About what?\" \n \n \"Well;—bribery and petitions, and the rest of it. Gentlemen when they\u0027re consulted don\u0027t like to be told of those sort of things. There has been a little of it, perhaps. Who can say?\" Who, indeed, if not Mr. Trigger,—in regard to Percycross? \"But it\u0027s better to let all that die out of itself. It never came to much in Percycross. I don\u0027t think there was ever more than ten shillings to be had for a vote. And I\u0027ve known half-a-crown a piece buy fifty of \u0027em,\" he added emphatically. \"It never was of much account, and it\u0027s best to say nothing about it.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s best perhaps to make one\u0027s intentions known,\" said Sir Thomas mildly. Mr. Trigger hummed and hawed, and shook his head, and put his hands into his trousers pockets;—and in his heart of hearts he despised Sir Thomas. \n \n On that day Sir Thomas was taken to see four gentlemen of note in Percycross,—a mustard-maker, a paper-maker, and two bootmakers. The mustard-maker was very cordial in offering his support. He would do anything for the cause. Trigger knew him. The men were all right at his mills. Then Sir Thomas said a word. He was a great foe to intimidation;—he wouldn\u0027t for worlds have the men coerced. The mustard-maker laughed cheerily. \"We know what all that comes to at Percycross; don\u0027t we, Trigger? We shall all go straight from this place;—shan\u0027t we, Trigger? And he needn\u0027t ask any questions;—need he, Trigger?\" \"Lord \u0027a mercy, no,\" said Trigger, who was beginning to be disgusted. Then they went on to the paper-maker\u0027s. \n \n The paper-maker was a very polite gentleman, who seemed to take great delight in shaking Sir Thomas by the hand, and who agreed with energy to every word Sir Thomas said. Trigger stood a little apart at the paper-maker\u0027s, as soon as the introduction had been performed,—perhaps disapproving in part of the paper-maker\u0027s principles. \"Certainly not, Sir Thomas; not for the world, Sir Thomas. I\u0027m clean against anything of that kind, Sir Thomas,\" said the paper-maker. Sir Thomas assured the paper-maker that he was glad to hear it;—and he was glad. As they went to the first bootmaker\u0027s, Mr. Trigger communicated to Sir Thomas a certain incident in the career of Mr. Spiveycomb, the paper-maker. \"He\u0027s got a contract for paper from the \u0027Walhamshire Herald,\u0027 Sir Thomas;—the largest circulation anywhere in these parts. Griffenbottom gets him that; and if ere a man of his didn\u0027t vote as he bade \u0027em, he wouldn\u0027t keep \u0027em, not a day. I don\u0027t know that we\u0027ve a man in Percycross so stanch as old Spiveycomb.\" This was Mr. Trigger\u0027s revenge. \n \n The first bootmaker had very little to say for himself, and hardly gave Sir Thomas much opportunity of preaching his doctrine of purity. \"I hope you\u0027ll do something for our trade, Sir Thomas,\" said the first bootmaker. Sir Thomas explained that he did not at present see his way to the doing of anything special for the bootmakers; and then took his leave. \"He\u0027s all right,\" said Mr. Trigger. \"He means it. He\u0027s all right. And he\u0027ll say a word to his men too, though I don\u0027t know that much \u0027ll come of it. They\u0027re a rum lot. If they\u0027re put out here to-day, they can get in there to-morrow. They\u0027re a cankery independent sort of chaps, are bootmakers. Now we\u0027ll go and see old Pile. He\u0027ll have to second one of you,—will Pile. He\u0027s a sort of father of the borough in the way of Conservatives. And look here, Sir Thomas;—let him talk. Don\u0027t you say much to him. It\u0027s no use in life talking to old Pile.\" Sir Thomas said nothing, but he determined that he would speak to old Pile just as freely as he had to Mr. Trigger himself. \n \n \"Eh;—ah;\"—said old Pile; \"you\u0027re Sir Thomas Underwood, are you? And you wants to go into Parliament?\" \n \n \"If it please you and your townsmen to send me there.\" \n \n \"Yes;—that\u0027s just it. But if it don\u0027t please?\" \n \n \"Why, then I\u0027ll go home again.\" \n \n \"Just so;—but the people here ain\u0027t what they are at other places, Sir Thomas Underwood. I\u0027ve seen many elections here, Sir Thomas.\" \n \n \"No doubt you have, Mr. Pile.\" \n \n \"Over a dozen;—haven\u0027t you, Mr. Pile?\" said Trigger. \n \n \"And carried on a deal better than they have been since you meddled with them,\" said Mr. Pile, turning upon Trigger. \"They used to do the thing here as it should be done, and nobody wasn\u0027t extortionate, nor yet cross-grained. They\u0027re changing a deal about these things, I\u0027m told; but they\u0027re changing all for the worse. They\u0027re talking of purity,—purity,—purity; and what does it all amount to? Men is getting greedier every day.\" \n \n \"We mean to be pure at this election, Mr. Pile,\" said Sir Thomas. Mr. Pile looked him hard in the face. \"At least I do, Mr. Pile. I can answer for myself.\" Mr. Pile turned away his face, and opened his mouth, and put his hand upon his stomach, and made a grimace, as though,—as though he were not quite as well as he might be. And such was the case with him. The idea of purity of election at Percy-cross did in truth make him feel very sick. It was an idea which he hated with his whole heart. There was to him something absolutely mean and ignoble in the idea of a man coming forward to represent a borough in Parliament without paying the regular fees. That somebody, somewhere, should make a noise about it,—somebody who was impalpable to him, in some place that was to him quite another world,—was intelligible. It might be all very well in Manchester and such-like disagreeable places. But that candidates should come down to Percycross and talk about purity there, was a thing abominable to him. He had nothing to get by bribery. To a certain extent he was willing to pay money in bribery himself. But that a stranger should come to the borough and want the seat without paying for it was to him so distasteful, that this assurance from the mouth of one of the candidates did make him very sick. \n \n \"I think you\u0027d better go back to London, Sir Thomas,\" said Mr. Pile, as soon as he recovered himself sufficiently to express his opinion. \n \n \"You mean that my ideas as to standing won\u0027t suit the borough.\" \n \n \"No, they won\u0027t, Sir Thomas. I don\u0027t suppose anybody else will tell you so,—but I\u0027ll do it. Why should, a poor man lose his day\u0027s wages for the sake of making you a Parliament man? What have you done for any of \u0027em?\" \n \n \"Half an hour would take a working man to the poll and back,\" argued Sir Thomas. \n \n \"That\u0027s all you know about elections. That\u0027s not the way we manage matters here. There won\u0027t be any place of business agait that day.\" Then Mr. Trigger whispered a few words to Mr. Pile. Mr. Pile repeated the grimace which he had made before, and turned on his heel although he was in his own parlour, as though he were going to leave them. But he thought better of this, and turned again. \"I always vote Blue myself,\" said Mr. Pile, \"and I don\u0027t suppose I shall do otherwise this time. But I shan\u0027t take no trouble. There\u0027s a many things that I don\u0027t like, Sir Thomas. Good morning, Sir Thomas. It\u0027s all very well for Mr. Trigger. He knows where the butter lies for his bread.\" \n \n \"A very disagreeable old man,\" said Sir Thomas, when they had left the house, thinking that as Mr. Trigger had been grossly insulted by the bootmaker he would probably coincide in this opinion. \n \n But Mr. Trigger knew his townsman well, and was used to him. \"He\u0027s better than some of \u0027em, Sir Thomas. He\u0027ll do as much as he says, and more. Now there was that chap Spicer at the mustard works. They say Westmacott people are after him, and if they can make it worth his while he\u0027ll go over. There\u0027s some talk about Apothecary\u0027s Hall;—I don\u0027t know what it is. But you couldn\u0027t buy old Pile if you were to give him the Queen and all the Royal family to make boots for.\" \n \n This was to have been the last of Sir Thomas\u0027s preliminary visits among the leading Conservatives of the borough, but as they were going back to the \"Percy Standard,\"—for such was the name of the Blue inn in the borough,—Mr. Trigger saw a gentleman in black standing at an open hall door, and immediately proposed that they should just say a word or two to Mr. Pabsby. \"Wesleyan minister,\" whispered the Percycross bear-leader into the ear of his bear;—\"and has a deal to say to many of the men, and more to the women. Can\u0027t say what he\u0027ll do;—split his vote, probably.\" Then he introduced the two men, explaining the cause of Sir Thomas\u0027s presence in the borough. Mr. Pabsby was delighted to make the acquaintance of Sir Thomas, and asked the two gentlemen into the house. In truth he was delighted. The hours often ran heavily with him, and here there was something for him to do. \"You\u0027ll give us a help, Mr. Pabsby?\" said Mr. Trigger. Mr. Pabsby smiled and rubbed his hands, and paused and laid his head on one side. \n \n \"I hope he will,\" said Sir Thomas, \"if he is of our way cf thinking, otherwise I should be sorry to ask him.\" Still Mr. Pabsby said nothing;—but he smiled very sweetly, and laid his head a little lower. \n Still Mr. Pabsby said nothing;--but he smiled very sweetly, and laid his head a little lower. \n Still Mr. Pabsby said nothing;--but he smiled \n very sweetly, and laid his head a little lower. \n Click to ENLARGE \n \n \"He knows we\u0027re on the respectable side,\" said Mr. Trigger. \"The Wesleyans now are most as one as the Church of England,—in the way of not being roughs and rowdies.\" Sir Thomas, who did not know Mr. Pabsby, was afraid that he would be offended at this; but he showed no sign of offence as he continued to rub his hands. Mr. Pabsby was meditating his speech. \n \n \"We\u0027re a little hurried, Mr. Pabsby,\" said Mr. Trigger; \"perhaps you\u0027ll think of it.\" \n \n But Mr. Pabsby was not going to let them escape in that way. It was not every day that he had a Sir Thomas, or a candidate for the borough, or even a Mr. Trigger, in that little parlour. The fact was that Mr. Trigger, who generally knew what he was about, had made a mistake. Sir Thomas, who was ready enough to depart, saw that an immediate escape was impossible. \"Sir Thomas,\" began Mr. Pabsby, in a soft, greasy voice,—a voice made up of pretence, politeness and saliva,—\"if you will give me three minutes to express myself on this subject I shall be obliged to you.\" \n \n \"Certainly,\" said Sir Thomas, sitting bolt upright in his chair, and holding his hat as though he were determined to go directly the three minutes were over. \n \n \"A minister of the Gospel in this town is placed in a peculiar position, Sir Thomas,\" said Mr. Pabsby very slowly, \"and of all the ministers of religion in Percycross mine is the most peculiar. In this matter I would wish to be guided wholly by duty, and if I could see my way clearly I would at once declare it to you. But, Sir Thomas, I owe much to the convictions of my people.\" \n \n \"Which way do you mean to vote?\" asked Mr. Trigger. \n \n Mr. Pabsby did not even turn his face at this interruption. \"A private man, Sir Thomas, may follow the dictates of—of—of his own heart, perhaps.\" Here he paused, expecting to be encouraged by some words. But Sir Thomas had acquired professionally a knowledge that to such a speaker as Mr. Pabsby any rejoinder or argument was like winding up a clock. It is better to allow such clocks to run down. \"With me, I have to consider every possible point. What will my people wish? Some of them are eager in the cause of reform, Sir Thomas; and some others—\" \n \n \"We shall lose the train,\" said Mr. Trigger, jumping up and putting on his hat. \n \n \"I\u0027m afraid we shall,\" said Sir Thomas rising, but not putting on his. \n \n \"Half a minute,\" said Mr. Pabsby pleading, but not rising from his chair. \"Perhaps you will do me the honour of calling on me when you are again here in Percycross. I shall have the greatest pleasure in discussing a few matters with you, Sir Thomas; and then, if I can give you my poor help, it will give me and Mrs. Pabsby the most sincere pleasure.\" Mrs. Pabsby had now entered the room, and was introduced; but Trigger would not sit down again, nor take off his hat. He boldly marshalled the way to the door, while Sir Thomas followed, subject as he came to the eloquence of Mr. Pabsby. \"If I can only see my way clearly, Sir Thomas,\" were the last words which Mr. Pabsby spoke. \n \n \"He\u0027ll give one to Griffenbottom, certainly,\" said Mr. Trigger. \"Westmacott \u0027ll probably have the other. I thought perhaps your title might have gone down with him, but it didn\u0027t seem to take.\" \n \n All this was anything but promising, anything but comfortable; and yet before he went to bed that night Sir Thomas had undertaken to stand. In such circumstances it is very hard for a man to refuse. He feels that a certain amount of trouble has been taken on his behalf, that retreat will be cowardly, and that the journey for nothing will be personally disagreeable to his own feelings. And then, too, there was that renewed ambition in his breast,—an ambition which six months ago he would have declared to be at rest for ever,—but which prompted him, now as strongly as ever, to go forward and do something. It is so easy to go and see;—so hard to retreat when one has seen. He had not found Percycross to be especially congenial to him. He had felt himself to be out of his element there,—among people with whom he had no sympathies; and he felt also that he had been unfitted for this kind of thing by the life which he had led for the last few years. Still he undertook to stand. \n \n \"Who is coming forward on the other side?\" he asked Mr. Trigger late at night, when this matter had been decided in regard to himself. \n \n \"Westmacott, of course,\" said Trigger, \"and I\u0027m told that the real Rads of the place have got hold of a fellow named Moggs.\" \n \n \"Moggs!\" ejaculated Sir Thomas. \n \n \"Yes;—Moggs. The Young Men\u0027s Reform Association is bringing him forward. He\u0027s a Trades\u0027 union man, and a Reform Leaguer, and all that kind of thing. I shouldn\u0027t be surprised if he got in. They say he\u0027s got money.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2745/75607.html","bookId":1376,"book":{"id":1376,"title":"Ralph the Heir","description":"简介： There are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there are also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise.
