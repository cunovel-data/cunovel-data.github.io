{"id":36810,"no":42,"title":"CHAPTER XLII. NOT BROKEN-HEARTED.","content":"Christmas had come and gone at Newton Priory, and the late Squire\u0027s son had left the place,—protesting as he did so that he left it for ever. To him also life in that particular spot of earth was impossible, unless he could live there as the lord and master of all. Everybody throughout that and neighbouring parishes treated him not only with kindness, but with the warmest affection. The gentry, the farmers, and the labourers, all men who had known him in the hunting-field, in markets, on the bench, or at church, men, women and children, joined together in forming plans by means of which he could remain at Newton. The young Squire asked him to make the house his home, at any rate for the hunting season. The parson offered half the parsonage. His friend Morris, who was a bachelor, suggested a joint home and joint stables between them. But it was all of no avail. Had it not been for the success which had so nearly crowned the late Squire\u0027s efforts during the last six months, it might have been that his friends would have prevailed with him. But he had been too near being the master to be able to live at Newton in any other capacity. The tenants had been told that they were to be his tenants. The servants had been told that they were to be his servants. During a few short weeks, he had almost been master, so absolute had been the determination of the old Squire to show to all around him that his son, in spite of the blot upon the young man\u0027s birth, was now the heir in all things, and possessed of every privilege which would attach itself to an elder son. He himself while his father lived had taken these things calmly, had shown no elation, had even striven to moderate the vehemence of his father\u0027s efforts on his behalf;—but not the less had he been conscious of the value of what was being done for him. To be the promised future owner of the acres on which he had lived, of the coverts through which he had ridden, of every tree and bank which he had known from his boyhood, had been to him a source of gratified pride not the less strong because he had concealed it. The disappointment did hit him sorely. His dreams had been of Parliament, of power in the county, of pride of place, and popularity. He now found that they were to be no more than dreams;—but with this additional sorrow, that all around him knew that they had been dreamed. No;—he could not stay at Newton even for the sake of living with friends who loved him so dearly. He said little or nothing of this to any one. Not even to Gregory Newton or to his friend Morris did he tell much of his feeling. He was not proud of his dreamings, and it seemed to himself that his punishment was just. Nor could he speak to either of them or to any man of his past ambition, or of what hopes might remain to him in reference to Mary Bonner. The young Squire had gone forth with the express purpose of wooing her, had declared his purpose of doing so, and had returned to Newton at any rate without any ready tale of triumph on his tongue. What had been his fortune the rival would not ask; and while the two remained together at the priory no further word was spoken of Mary Bonner. He, Ralph the dispossessed one, while he believed himself to be the heir, had intended to bring her home as a fitting queen to share his throne. It might be that she would consent to be his without a throne to share; but in thinking of her he could not but remember what his ambition had been, and he could hardly bring himself now to offer to her that which was comparatively so little worth the having. To suppose that she should already \"be fond of him,\" should already long for him as he longed for her, was contrary to his nature. Hitherto when he had been in her presence, he had stood there as a man whose position in life was almost contemptible; and though it would be unjust to him to say that he had hoped to win her by his acres, still he had felt that his father\u0027s success on his behalf might justify him in that which would otherwise be unjustifiable. For the present, however, he could take no steps in that direction. He could only suggest to himself what had already been her answer, or what at some future time might be the answer she would make to his rival. He had lost a father between whom and himself there had existed ties, not only of tender love, but of perfect friendship, and for awhile he must bewail his loss. That he could not bewail his lost father without thinking of his lost property, and of the bride that had never been won, was an agony to his soul. He had found a farm down in Norfolk, near to Swaffham, which he could take for twelve months, with the option of purchase at the expiration of that time, and thither he betook himself. There were about four hundred acres, and the place was within his means. He did not think it likely that Mary Bonner would choose to come and live upon a Norfolk farm; and yet what other work in life was there for which he was fit? Early in January he went down to Beamingham Hall, as the place was called, and there we will leave him for the present, consoling himself with oil-cake, and endeavouring to take a pride in a long row of stall-fed cattle. At this time the two brothers were living at Newton Priory. Ralph the heir had bought some of his uncle\u0027s horses, and had commenced hunting with the hounds around him; though he had not as yet withdrawn his stud from the Moonbeam. He was not altogether at his ease, as he had before the end of February received three or four letters from Neefit, all of them dictated by Waddle, in which his conduct was painted not in the most flattering colours. Neefit\u0027s money had been repaid, but Neefit would not understand that the young heir\u0027s obligations to him had by any means been acquitted by that very ordinary process. He had risked his money when payment was very doubtful, and now he intended to have something beyond cash in return for all that he had done. \"There are debts of honour which a real gentleman feels himself more bound to pay than any bills,\" Waddle had written. And to such dogmatic teachings as these Neefit would always add something out of his own head. \"There ain\u0027t nobody who shan\u0027t know all about it, unless you\u0027re on the square again.\" Ralph had written one reply since he had been at Newton, in which he explained at some length that it was impossible that he should renew his addresses to a young lady who had twice rejected them, and who had assured him that she did not love him. He professed the greatest respect for Miss Neefit, a respect which had, if possible, been heightened by her behaviour in this matter,—but it must now be understood that the whole affair was at an end. Neefit would not understand this, but Neefit\u0027s further letters, which had not been unfrequent, were left unanswered. Ralph had now told the whole story to his brother, and had written his one reply from Newton in conformity with his brother\u0027s advice. After that they both thought that no further rejoinder could be of any service. The parsonage was for the time deserted, Gregory having for the present consented to share his brother\u0027s house. In spite of that little thorn in the flesh which Neefit was, Ralph was able to enjoy his life very thoroughly. He went on with all the improvements about the place which the Squire had commenced, and was active in making acquaintance with every one who lived upon his land. He was not without good instincts, and understood thoroughly that respectability had many more attractions than a character for evil living. He was, too, easily amenable to influence from those around him; and under Gregory\u0027s auspices, was constant at his parish church. He told himself at once that he had many duties to perform, and he attempted to perform them. He did not ask Lieutenant Cox or Captain Fooks to the Priory, and quite prepared himself for the character of Henry V. in miniature, as he walked about his park, and rode about his farms, and talked with the wealthier farmers on hunting mornings. He had a full conception of his own dignity, and some not altogether inaccurate idea of the manner in which it would become him to sustain it. He was, perhaps, a little too self-conscious, and over-inclined to suppose that people were regarding his conduct because he was Newton of Newton;—Newton of Newton with no blot on his shield, by right of his birth, and subject to no man\u0027s reproach. He had failed grievously in one matter on which he had set his heart; but as to that he was, as the reader knows, resolved to try again. He had declared his passion to the other Ralph, but his rival had not made the confidence mutual. But hitherto he had said nothing on the subject to his brother. He had put it by, as it were, out of his mind for awhile, resolving that it should not trouble him immediately, in the middle of his new joys. It was a thing that would keep,—a thing, at any rate, that need not overshadow him night and morning. When Neefit continued to disturb him with threats of publicity in regard to Polly\u0027s wrongs, he did tell himself that in no way could he so effectually quiet Mr. Neefit as by marrying somebody else, and that he would, at some very early date, have recourse to this measure; but, in the meantime, he would enjoy himself without letting his unrequited passion lie too heavily as a burden on his heart. So he eat and drank, and rode and prayed, and sat with his brother magistrates on the bench, and never ceased to think of his good fortune, in that he had escaped from the troubles of his youth, unscathed and undegraded. Then there came a further letter from Mr. Neefit, from which there arose some increase of confidence among the brothers. There was nothing special in this letter. These letters, indeed, were very like to each other, and, as had now come to be observed, were always received on a Tuesday morning. It was manifest to them that Neefit spent the leisure hours of his Sundays in meditating upon the hardness of his position; and that, as every Monday morning came, he caused a new letter to be written. On this particular Tuesday, Ralph had left home before the post had come, and did not get the breeches-maker\u0027s epistle till his return from hunting. He chucked it across the table to Gregory when he came down to dinner, and the parson read it. There was no new attack in it; and as the servant was in the room, nothing was then said about it. But after dinner the subject was discussed. \"I wish I knew how to stop the fellow\u0027s mouth,\" said the elder brother. \"I think I should get Carey to see him,\" suggested Gregory. \"He would understand a lawyer when he was told that nothing could come of it but trouble to himself and his daughter.\" \"She has no hand in it, you know.\" \"But it must injure her.\" \"One would think so. But she is a girl whom nothing can injure. You can\u0027t imagine how good and how great she is;—great in her way, that is. She is as steady as a rock; and nobody who knows her will ever imagine her to be a party to her father\u0027s folly. She may pick and choose a husband any day she pleases. And the men about her won\u0027t mind this kind of thing as we should. No doubt all their friends joke him about it, but no one will think of blaming Polly.\" \"It can\u0027t do her any good,\" said Gregory. \"It cannot do her any harm. She has a strength of her own that even her father can\u0027t lessen.\" \"All the same, I wish there were an end of it.\" \"So do I, for my own sake,\" said Ralph. As he spoke he filled his glass, and passed the bottle, and then was silent for a few moments. \"Neefit did help me,\" he continued, \"and I don\u0027t want to speak against him; but he is the most pig-headed old fool that ever existed. Nothing will stop him but Polly\u0027s marriage, or mine.\" \"I suppose you will marry soon now. You ought to be married,\" said Gregory, in a melancholy tone, in which was told something of the disappointment of his own passion. \"Well;—yes. I believe I might as well tell you a little secret, Greg.\" \"I suppose I can guess it,\" said Gregory, with still a deeper sound of woe. \"I don\u0027t think you can. It is quite possible you may, however. You know Mary Bonner;—don\u0027t you?\" The cloud upon the parson\u0027s brow was at once lightened. \"No,\" said he. \"I have heard of her, of course.\" \"You have never seen Mary Bonner?\" \"I have not been up in town since she came. What should take me up? And if I were there, I doubt whether I should go out to Fulham. What is the use of going?\" But still, though he spoke thus, there was something less of melancholy in his voice than when he had first spoken. Ralph did not immediately go on with his story, and his brother now asked a question. \"But what of Mary Bonner? Is she to be the future mistress of the Priory?\" \"God only knows.\" \"But you mean to ask her?\" \"I have asked her.\" \"And you are engaged?\" \"By no means. I wish I were. You haven\u0027t seen her, but I suppose you have heard of her?\" \"Ralph spoke of her,—and told me that she was very lovely.\" \"Upon my word, I don\u0027t think that even in a picture I ever saw anything approaching to her beauty. You\u0027ve seen that thing at Dresden. She is more like that than anything I know. She seems almost too grand for a fellow to speak to, and yet she looks as if she didn\u0027t know it. I don\u0027t think she does know it.\" Gregory said not a word, but looked at his brother, listening. \"But, by George there\u0027s a dignity about her, a sort of self-possession, a kind of noli me tangere, you understand, which makes a man almost afraid to come near her. She hasn\u0027t sixpence in the world.\" \"That needn\u0027t signify to you now.\" \"Not in the least. I only just mention it to explain. And her father was nobody in particular,—some old general who used to wear a cocked hat and keep the niggers down out in one of the colonies. She herself talked of coming home here to be a governess;—by Jove! yes, a governess. Well, to look at her, you\u0027d think she was born a countess in her own right.\" \"Is she so proud?\" \"No;—it\u0027s not that. I don\u0027t know what it is. It\u0027s the way her head is put on. Upon my word, to see her turn her neck is the grandest thing in the world. I never saw anything like it. I don\u0027t know that she\u0027s proud by nature,—though she has got a dash of that too. Don\u0027t you know there are some horses show their breeding at a glance? I don\u0027t suppose they feel it themselves; but there it is on them, like the Hall-mark on silver. I don\u0027t know whether you can understand a man being proud of his wife.\" \"Indeed I can.\" \"I don\u0027t mean of her personal qualities, but of the outside get up. Some men are proud of their wives\u0027 clothes, or their jewels, or their false hair. With Mary nothing of that sort could have any effect; but to see her step, or move her head, or lift her arm, is enough to make a man feel,—feel,—feel that she beats every other woman in the world by chalks.\" \"And she is to be mistress here?\" \"Indeed she should,—to-morrow, if she\u0027d come.\" \"You did ask her?\" \"Yes,—I asked her.\" \"And what did she say?\" \"Nothing that I cared to hear. She had just been told all this accursed story about Polly Neefit. I\u0027ll never forgive Sir Thomas,—never.\" The reader will be pleased to remember that Sir Thomas did not mention Miss Neefit\u0027s name, or any of the circumstances of the Neefit contract, to his niece. \"He could hardly have wished to set her against you.\" \"I don\u0027t know; but he must have told her. She threw it in my teeth that I ought to marry Polly.\" \"Then she did not accept you?\" \"By George! no;—anything but that. She is one of those women who, as I fancy, never take a man at the first offer. It isn\u0027t that they mean to shilly and shally and make a fuss, but there\u0027s a sort of majesty about them which instinctively declines to yield itself. Unconsciously they feel something like offence at the suggestion that a man should think enough of himself to ask for such a possession. They come to it, after a time.\" \"And she will come to it, after a time?\" \"I didn\u0027t mean to say that. I don\u0027t intend, however, to give it up.\" Ralph paused in his story, considering whether he would tell his brother what Mary had confessed to him as to her affection for some one else, but he resolved, at last, that he would say nothing of that. He had himself put less of confidence in that assertion than he did in her rebuke with reference to the other young woman to whom she chose to consider that he owed himself. It was his nature to think rather of what absolutely concerned himself, than of what related simply to her. \"I shan\u0027t give her up. That\u0027s all I can say,\" he continued. \"I\u0027m not the sort of fellow to give things up readily.\" It did occur to Gregory at that moment that his brother had not shown much self-confidence on that question of giving up the property. \"I\u0027m pretty constant when I\u0027ve set my mind on a thing. I\u0027m not going to let any woman break my heart for me, but I shall stick to it.\" He was not going to let any woman break his heart for him! Gregory, as he heard this, knew that his brother regarded him as a man whose heart was broken, and he could not help asking himself whether or not it was good for a man that he should be able to suffer as he suffered, because a woman was fair and yet not fair for him. That his own heart was broken,—broken after the fashion of which his brother was speaking,—he was driven to confess to himself. It was not that he should die, or that his existence would be one long continued hour of misery to him. He could eat and drink, and do his duty and enjoy his life. And yet his heart was broken. He could not piece it so that it should be fit for any other woman. He could not teach himself not to long for that one woman who would not love him. The romance of his life had formed itself there, and there it must remain. In all his solitary walks it was of her that he still thought. Of all the bright castles in the air which he still continued to build, she was ever the mistress. And yet he knew that she would never make him happy. He had absolutely resolved that he would not torment her by another request. But he gave himself no praise for his constancy, looking on himself as being somewhat weak in that he could not overcome his longing. When Ralph declared that he would not break his heart, but that, nevertheless, he would stick to the girl, Gregory envied him, not doubting of his success, and believing that it was to men of this calibre that success in love is generally given. \"I hope with all my heart that you may win her,\" he said. \"I must run my chance like another. There\u0027s no \u0027Veni, vidi, vici,\u0027 about it, I can tell you; nor is it likely that there should be with such a girl as Mary Bonner. Fill your glass, old fellow. We needn\u0027t sit mumchance because we\u0027re thinking of our loves.\" \"I had thought,—\" began Gregory very slowly. \"What did you think?\" \"I had thought once that you were thinking of—Clarissa.\" \"What put that into your head?\" \"If you had I should never have said a word, nor fancied any wrong. Of course she\u0027ll marry some one. And I don\u0027t know why I should ever wish that it should not be you.\" \"But what made you think of it?\" \"Well; I did. It was just a word that Patience said in one of her letters.\" \"What sort of word?\" asked Ralph, with much interest. \"It was nothing, you know. I just misunderstood her. When one is always thinking of a thing everything turns itself that way. I got it into my head that she meant to hint to me that as you and Clary were fond of each other, I ought to forget it all. I made up my mind that I would;—but it is so much easier to make up one\u0027s mind than to do it.\" There came a tear in each eye as he spoke, and he turned his face towards the fire that his brother might not see them. And there they remained hot and oppressive, because he would not raise his hand to rub them away. \"I wonder what it was she said,\" asked Ralph. \"Oh, nothing. Don\u0027t you know how a fellow has fancies?\" \"There wasn\u0027t anything in it,\" said Ralph. \"Oh;—of course not.\" \"Patience might have imagined it,\" said Ralph. \"That\u0027s just like such a sister as Patience.\" \"She\u0027s the best woman that ever lived,\" said Gregory. \"As good as gold,\" said Ralph. \"I don\u0027t think, however, I shall very soon forgive Sir Thomas.\" \"I don\u0027t mind saying now that I am glad it is so,\" said Gregory; \"though as regards Clary that seems to be cruel. But I don\u0027t think I could have come much here had she become your wife.\" \"Nothing shall ever separate us, Greg.\" \"I hope not;—but I don\u0027t know whether I could have done it. I almost think that I oughtn\u0027t to live where I should see her; and I did fear it at one time.\" \"She\u0027ll come to the parsonage yet, old fellow, if you\u0027ll stick to her,\" said Ralph. \"Never,\" said Gregory. Then that conversation was over.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2745/75629.html","bookId":1376,"book":{"id":1376,"title":"Ralph the Heir","description":"简介： There are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there are also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise.
