{"id":36805,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVII. \"HE MUST MARRY HER.\"","content":"On the day following that on which Mr. Neefit made his journey to the Moonbeam, Sir Thomas Underwood was at his chambers in London. It was now eight weeks since his bone had been broken, and though he still carried his arm in a sling, he declared of himself that he was able to go about as usual;—which assertion was taken at the villa as meaning that he was now able to live in Southampton Buildings without further assistance from women. When Patience reminded him, with tears in her eyes, that he could not as yet put on his own coat, he reminded her that Stemm was the most careful of men. Up to London he went with a full understanding that he was not at any rate to be expected home on that night. He had business on hand of great importance, which, as he declared, made his presence in town imperative. Mr. Trigger, from Percycross, was to be up with reference to the pestilent petition which had been presented against the return of Griffenbottom and himself. Moggs had petitioned on his own behalf, and two of the Liberals of the borough had also petitioned in the interest of Mr. Westmacott. The two Liberal parties who had quarrelled during the contest had now again joined forces in reference to the petition, and there was no doubt that the matter would go on before the judge. Mr. Trigger was coming up to London with reference to the defence. Sir Thomas gave Stemm to understand that Mr. Trigger would call at one o\u0027clock. \n \n Exactly at one o\u0027clock the bell was rung at Sir Thomas\u0027s outside door, and Stemm was on the alert to give entrance to Mr. Trigger. When the door was opened who should present himself but our unfortunate friend Neefit. He humbly asked whether Sir Thomas was within, and received a reply which, as coming from Stemm, was courteous in the extreme. \"Mr. Trigger, I suppose;—walk in, Mr. Trigger.\" Neefit, not at all understanding why he was called Trigger, did walk in. Stemm, opening the door of his master\u0027s sanctum, announced Mr. Trigger. Neefit advanced into the middle of the room. Sir Thomas, with some solicitude as to the adjustment of his arm, rose to greet his agent from Percy cross. \"This isn\u0027t Mr. Trigger,\" said Sir Thomas. \"He told me he was, anyhow,\" said Stemm, \"I didn\u0027t tell you nothing of the kind,\" said Neefit. \"But you come from Percycross?\" said Sir Thomas. \"No I don\u0027t; I comes from Conduit Street,\" said Neefit. \"You must go away,\" said Stemm, leaving the door open, and advancing into the room as though to turn the enemy\u0027s flank. \n \n But Neefit, having made good his point so far, did not intend to be dislodged without a struggle on his own part. \"I\u0027ve something to say to Sir Thomas about Mr. Newton, as I wants to say very particular.\" \"You can\u0027t say it now,\" said Stemm. \"Oh, but I can,\" said Neefit, \"and it won\u0027t take three minutes.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t another day do for it, as I am particularly busy now?\" pleaded Sir Thomas. \"Well, Sir Thomas;—to tell the truth, it wouldn\u0027t,\" said Mr. Neefit, standing his ground. Then there came another ring at the bell. \"Ask Mr. Trigger to sit down in the other room for two minutes, Stemm,\" said Sir Thomas. And so Mr. Neefit had carried his point. \"And now, sir,\" said Sir Thomas, \"as I am particularly engaged, I will ask you to be as quick as possible.\" \n \n \"My name is Neefit,\" began the breeches-maker,—and then paused. Sir Thomas, who had heard the name from Ralph, but had forgotten it altogether, merely bowed his head. \"I am the breeches-maker of Conduit Street,\" continued Mr. Neefit, with a proud conviction that he too had ascended so high in his calling as to be justified in presuming that he was known to mankind. Sir Thomas again bowed. Neefit went on with his story. \"Mr. Newton is a-going to behave to me very bad.\" \n \n \"If he owes you money, he can pay you now,\" said Sir Thomas. \n \n \"He do owe me money;—a thousand pound he owe me.\" \n \n \"A thousand pounds for breeches!\" \n \n \"No, Sir Thomas. It\u0027s most for money lent; but it\u0027s not along of that as I\u0027d trouble you. I know how to get my money, or to put up with the loss if I don\u0027t. A thousand pound ain\u0027t here nor there,—not in what I\u0027ve got to say. I wouldn\u0027t demean myself to ring at your bell, Sir Thomas;—not in the way of looking for a thousand pounds.\" \n \n \"In God\u0027s name, then, what is it? Pray be quick.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s going back from his word as he\u0027s promised to my daughter. That\u0027s what it is.\" As Neefit paused again, Sir Thomas remembered Ralph\u0027s proposition, made in his difficulties, as to marrying a tradesman\u0027s daughter for money, and at once fell to the conclusion that Mr. and Miss Neefit had been ill-used. \"Sir Thomas,\" continued the breeches-maker, \"I\u0027ve been as good as a father to him. I gave him money when nobody else wouldn\u0027t.\" \n \n \"Do you mean that he has had money from you?\" \n \n \"Yes; in course he has; ever so much. I paid for him a lot of money to \u0027Orsball, where he \u0027unts. Money! I should think so. Didn\u0027t I pay Moggs for him, the bootmaker? The very money as is rattling in his pocket now is my money.\" \n \n \"And he engaged himself to your daughter?\" \n \n \"He engaged hisself to me to marry her. He won\u0027t say no otherwise himself. And he asked her twice. Why, Sir Thomas, he was all on the square about it till the old gentleman broke his neck. He hadn\u0027t nowhere else to go to for a shilling. But now the estate\u0027s come in like, he\u0027s for behaving dishonourable. He don\u0027t know me yet; that\u0027s what he don\u0027t. But I\u0027ll make him know me, Sir Thomas.\" \n \n Then the door was opened, and Stemm\u0027s head appeared. \"Mr. Trigger says as he\u0027s in the greatest possible haste, Sir Thomas.\" The reader, however, may as well be informed that this was pure invention on the part of Mr. Stemm. \n \n Sir Thomas tore his hair and rubbed his face. He couldn\u0027t bid Neefit to call again, as he certainly did not desire to have a second visit. \"What can I do for you, Mr. Neefit? I have no doubt the money will be paid, if owing. I will guarantee that for you.\" \n \n \"It ain\u0027t the money. I knows how to get my money.\" \n \n \"Then what can I do for you?\" \n \n \"Make him go upon the square, Sir Thomas.\" \n \n \"How can I make him? He\u0027s twenty-six years old, and he\u0027s nothing to me. I don\u0027t think he should marry the young lady. He\u0027s not in her rank of life. If he has done her an injury, he must pay for it.\" \n \n \"Injury!\" shouted Neefit, upon whose mind the word produced an unintended idea. \"No, no! Our Polly ain\u0027t like that. By G——, I\u0027d eat him, if it was that way! There ain\u0027t a duchess in the land as \u0027d \u0027ve guv\u0027 him his answer more ready than Polly had he ever spoke to her that way.\" \n \n \"If he has given rise to hopes which through him will be disappointed,\" said Sir Thomas, gravely, \"he is bound to make what compensation may be in his power.\" \n \n \"Compensation be d——!\" said Neefit. \"He must marry her.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think he will do that.\" \n \n \"You didn\u0027t think he would take my money, I suppose; but he did. You didn\u0027t think he\u0027d come and spend his Sundays out at my cottage, but he did. You didn\u0027t think as he\u0027d come after our Polly down to Ramsgate, but he did. You didn\u0027t think as he\u0027d give me his word to make her his wife, but he did.\" At every assertion that he made, the breeches-maker bobbed forward his bullet head, stretched open his eyes, and stuck out his under lip. During all this excited energy, he was not a man pleasant to the eye. \"And now how is it to be, Sir Thomas? That\u0027s what I want to know.\" \n \n \"Mr. Newton is nothing to me, Mr. Neefit.\" \n \n \"Oh;—that\u0027s all. Nothing to you, ain\u0027t he? Wasn\u0027t he brought up by you just as a son like? And now he ain\u0027t nothing to you! Do you mean to say as he didn\u0027t ought to marry my girl?\" \n \n \"I think he ought not to marry her.\" \n \n \"Not arter his promise?\" \n \n Sir Thomas was driven very hard, whereas had the sly old breeches-maker told all his story, there would have been no difficulty at all. \"I think such a marriage would lead to the happiness of neither party. If an injury has been done,—as I fear may be too probable,—I will advise my young friend to make any reparation in his power—short of marriage. I can say nothing further, Mr. Neefit.\" \n \n \"And that\u0027s your idea of being on the square, Sir Thomas?\" \n \n \"I can say nothing further, Mr. Neefit. As I have an appointment made, I must ask you to leave me.\" As Sir Thomas said this, his hand was upon the bell. \n \n \"Very well;—very well. As sure as my name\u0027s Neefit, he shall hear of me. And so shall you, Sir Thomas. Don\u0027t you be poking at me in that way, old fellow. I don\u0027t choose to be poked at.\" These last words were addressed to Stemm, who had entered the room, and was holding the door open for Mr. Neefit\u0027s exit with something more than the energy customary in speeding a parting guest. Mr. Neefit, however, did take his departure, and Sir Thomas joined Mr. Trigger in the other room. \n \n We will not be present at that interview. Sir Thomas had been in a great hurry to get rid of Mr. Neefit, but it may be doubted whether he found Mr. Trigger much better company. Mr. Trigger\u0027s business chiefly consisted in asking Sir Thomas for a considerable sum of money, and in explaining to him that the petition would certainly cost a large sum beyond this,—unless the expenses could be saddled on Westmacott and Moggs, as to which result Mr. Trigger seemed to have considerable doubt. But perhaps the bitterest part of Mr. Trigger\u0027s communication consisted in the expression of his opinion that Mr. Griffenbottom should be held by Sir Thomas free from any expense as to the petition, on the ground that Griffenbottom, had he stood alone, would certainly have carried one of the seats without any fear of a petition. \"I don\u0027t think I can undertake that, Mr. Trigger,\" said Sir Thomas. Mr. Trigger simply shrugged his shoulders. \n \n Sir Thomas, when he was alone, was very uncomfortable. While at Percycross he had extracted from Patience an idea that Ralph the heir and Clarissa were attached to each other, and he had very strongly declared that he would not admit an engagement between them. At that time Ralph was supposed to have sold his inheritance, and did not stand well in Sir Thomas\u0027s eyes. Then had come the Squire\u0027s death and the altered position of his late ward. Sir Thomas would be injured, would be made subject to unjust reproach if it were thought of him that he would be willing to give his daughter to a young man simply because that young man owned an estate. He had no such sordid feeling in regard to his girls. But he did feel that all that had occurred at Newton had made a great difference. Ralph would now live at the Priory, and there would be enough even for his extravagance. Should the Squire of Newton ask him for his girl\u0027s hand with that girl\u0027s consent, he thought that he could hardly refuse it. How could he ask Clarissa to abandon so much seeming happiness because the man had failed to keep out of debt upon a small income? He could not do so. And then it came to pass that he was prepared to admit Ralph as a suitor to his child should Ralph renew his request to that effect. They had all loved the lad as a boy, and the property was wholly unencumbered. Of course he said nothing to Clarissa; but should Ralph come to him there could be but one answer. Such had been the state of his mind before Mr. Neefit\u0027s visit. \n \n But the breeches-maker\u0027s tale had altered the aspect of things very greatly. Under no circumstances could Sir Thomas recommend the young Squire to marry the daughter of the man who had been with him; but if Ralph Newton had really engaged himself to this girl, and had done so with the purport of borrowing money from the father, that might be a reason why, notwithstanding the splendour of his prospects, he should not be admitted to further intimacy at the villa. To borrow money from one\u0027s tradesman was, in the eyes of Sir Thomas, about as inexcusable an offence as a young man could commit. He was too much disturbed in mind to go home on the following day, but on the Thursday he returned to the villa. The following Sunday would be Christmas Day. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2745/75624.html","bookId":1376,"book":{"id":1376,"title":"Ralph the Heir","description":"简介： There are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there are also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise.
