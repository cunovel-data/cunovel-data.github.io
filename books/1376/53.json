{"id":36821,"no":53,"title":"CHAPTER LIII. THE END OF POLLY NEEFIT.","content":"Rumours, well-supported rumours, as to the kind of life which Mr. Neefit was leading reached Alexandra Cottage, filling Mrs. Neefit\u0027s mind with dismay, and making Polly very angry indeed. He came home always somewhat the worse for drink, and would talk of punching the heads both of Mr. Newton and of Mr. Ontario Moggs. Waddle, who was very true to his master\u0027s interests, had taken an opportunity of seeing Mrs. Neefit, and of expressing a very distinct idea that the business was going to the mischief. Mrs. Neefit was of opinion that in this emergency the business should be sold, and that they might safely remove themselves to some distant country,—to Tunbridge, or perhaps to Ware. Polly, however, would not accede to her mother\u0027s views. The evil must, she thought, be cured at once. \"If father goes on like this, I shall just walk straight out of the house, and marry Moggs at once,\" Polly said. \"Father makes no account of my name, and so I must just look out for myself.\" She had not as yet communicated these intentions to Ontario, but she was quite sure that she would be supported in her views by him whenever she should choose to do so. \n \n Once or twice Ontario came down to the cottage, and when he did so, Mr. Neefit was always told of the visit. \"I ain\u0027t going to keep anything from father, mother,\" Polly would say. \"If he chooses to misbehave, that isn\u0027t my fault. I mean to have Mr. Moggs, and it\u0027s only natural I should like to see him.\" Neefit, when informed of these visits, after swearing that Moggs junior was a sneaking scoundrel to come to his house in his absence, would call upon Moggs senior, and swear with many threats that his daughter should have nothing but what she stood up in. Moggs senior would stand quite silent, cutting the skin on his hand with his shoemaker\u0027s knife, and would simply bid the infuriated breeches-maker good morning, when he left the shop. But, in truth, Mr. Moggs senior had begun to doubt. \"I\u0027d leave it awhile, Onty, if I was you,\" he said. \"May be, after all, he\u0027ll give her nothing.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll take her the first day she\u0027ll come to me,—money or no money,\" said Moggs junior. \n \n Foiled ambition had, in truth, driven the breeches-maker to madness. But there were moments in which he was softened, melancholy, and almost penitent. \"Why didn\u0027t you have him when he come down to Margate,\" he said, with the tears running down his cheek, that very evening after eating his rump-steak in Mr. Newton\u0027s rooms. The soda-water and brandy, with a little gin-and-water after it, had reduced him to an almost maudlin condition, so that he was unable to support his parental authority. \n \n \"Because I didn\u0027t choose, father. It wasn\u0027t his fault. He spoke fair enough,—though I don\u0027t suppose he ever wanted it. Why should he?\" \n \n \"You might have had him then. He\u0027d \u0027ve never dared to go back. I\u0027d a killed him if he had.\" \n \n \"What good would it have done, father? He\u0027d never have loved me, and he\u0027d have despised you and mother.\" \n \n \"I wouldn\u0027t \u0027ve minded that,\" said Mr. Neefit, wiping his eyes. \n \n \"But I should have minded. What should I have felt with a husband as wouldn\u0027t have wanted me ever to have my own father in his house? Would that have made me happy?\" \n \n \"It \u0027d \u0027ve made me happy to know as you was there.\" \n \n \"No, father; there would have been no happiness in it. When I came to see what he was I knew I should never love him. He was just willing to take me because of his word;—and was I going to a man like that? No, father;—certainly not.\" The poor man was at that moment too far gone in his misery to argue the matter further, and he lay on the old sofa, very much at Polly\u0027s mercy. \"drop it, father,\" she said. \"It wasn\u0027t to be, and it couldn\u0027t have been. You\u0027d better say you\u0027ll drop it.\" But, sick and uncomfortable as he was on that evening, he couldn\u0027t be got to say that he would drop it. \n \n Nor could he be got to drop it for some ten days after that;—but on a certain evening he had come home very uncomfortable from the effects of gin-and-water, and had been spoken to very sensibly both by his wife and daughter. \n \n By seven on the following morning Ontario Moggs was sitting in the front parlour of the house at Hendon, and Polly Neefit was sitting with him. He had never been there at so early an hour before, and it was thought afterwards by both Mr. and Mrs. Neefit that his appearance, so unexpected by them, had not surprised their daughter Polly. Could it have been possible that she had sent a message to him after that little scene with her father? There he was, at any rate, and Polly was up to receive him. \"Now, Onty, that\u0027ll do. I didn\u0027t want to talk nonsense, but just to settle something.\" \n \n \"But you\u0027ll tell a fellow that you\u0027re glad to see him?\" \n \n \"No, I won\u0027t. I won\u0027t tell a fellow anything he doesn\u0027t know already. You and I have got to get married.\" \n \n \"Of course we have.\" \n \n \"But we want father\u0027s consent. I\u0027m not going to have him made unhappy, if I can help it. He\u0027s that wretched sometimes at present that my heart is half killed about him.\" \n \n \"The things he says are monstrous,\" asserted Moggs, thinking of the protestation lately made by the breeches-maker in his own hearing, to the effect that Ralph Newton should yet be made to marry his daughter. \n \n \"All the same I\u0027ve got to think about him. There\u0027s a dozen or so of men as would marry me, Mr. Moggs; but I can never have another father.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll be the first of the dozen any way,\" said the gallant Ontario. \n \n \"That depends. However, mother says so, and if father \u0027ll consent, I won\u0027t go against it. I\u0027ll go to him now, before he\u0027s up, and I\u0027ll tell him you\u0027re here. I\u0027ll bring him to his senses if I can. I don\u0027t know whatever made him think so much about gentlemen.\" \n \n \"He didn\u0027t learn it from you, Polly.\" \n \n \"Perhaps he did, after all; and if so, that\u0027s the more reason why I\u0027d forgive him.\" So saying, Polly went up-stairs upon her mission. On the landing she met her mother, and made known the fact that Ontario was in the parlour. \"Don\u0027t you go to him, mother;—not yet,\" said Polly. Whereby it may be presumed that Mrs. Neefit had been informed of Mr. Moggs\u0027s visit before Polly had gone to him. \n \n Mr. Neefit was in bed, and his condition apparently was not a happy one. He was lying with his head between his hands, and was groaning, not loudly, but very bitterly. His mode of life for the last month had not been of a kind to make him comfortable, and his conscience, too, was ill at ease. He had been a hard-working man, who had loved respectability and been careful of his wife and child. He had been proud to think that nobody could say anything against him, and that he had always paid his way. Up to the time of this disastrous fit of ambition on Polly\u0027s behalf he had never made himself ridiculous, and had been a prosperous tradesman, well thought of by his customers. Suddenly he had become mad, but not so mad as to be unconscious of his own madness. The failure of his hopes, joined to the inexpressibly bitter feeling that in their joint transactions young Newton had received all that had been necessary to him, whereas he, Neefit, had got none of that for which he had bargained,—these together had so upset him that he had lost his balance, had travelled out of his usual grooves, and had made an ass of himself. He knew he had made an ass of himself,—and was hopelessly endeavouring to show himself to be less of an ass than people thought him, by some success in his violence. If he could only punish young Newton terribly, people would understand why he had done all this. But drink had been necessary to give him courage for his violence, and now as he lay miserable in bed, his courage was very low. \n \n \"Father,\" said Polly, \"shall I give you a drink?\" Neefit muttered something, and took the cold tea that was offered to him. It was cold tea, with just a spoonful of brandy in it to make it acceptable. \"Father, there ought to be an end of all this;—oughtn\u0027t there?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know about no ends. I\u0027ll be down on him yet.\" \n \n \"No you won\u0027t, father. And why should you? He has done nothing wrong to you or me. I wouldn\u0027t have him if it was ever so.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s all been your fault, Polly.\" \n \n \"Yes;—my fault; that I wouldn\u0027t be made what you call a lady; to be taken away, so that I\u0027d never see any more of you and mother!\" Then she put her hand gently on his shoulder. \"I couldn\u0027t stand that, father.\" \n \n \"I\u0027d make him let you come to us.\" \n \n \"A wife must obey her husband, father. Mother always obeyed you.\" \n \n \"No, she didn\u0027t. She\u0027s again me now.\" \n \n \"Besides, I don\u0027t want to be a lady,\" said Polly, seeing that she had better leave that question of marital obedience; \"and I won\u0027t be a lady. I won\u0027t be better than you and mother.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ve been brought up better.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll show my breeding, then, by being true to you, and true to the man I love. What would you think of your girl, if she was to give her hand to a—gentleman, when she\u0027d given her heart to a—shoemaker?\" \n \n \"Oh, d—— the shoemaker!\" \n \n \"No, father, I won\u0027t have it. What is there against Ontario? He\u0027s a fine-hearted fellow, as isn\u0027t greedy after money,—as \u0027d kiss the very ground I stand on he\u0027s that true to me, and is a tradesman as yourself. If we had a little place of our own, wouldn\u0027t Ontario be proud to have you there, and give you the best of everything; and wouldn\u0027t I wait upon you, just only trying to know beforehand every tittle as you\u0027d like to have. And if there was to be babies, wouldn\u0027t they be brought up to love you. If I\u0027d gone with that young man down to his fine place, do you think it would have been like that? How \u0027d I\u0027ve felt when he was too proud to let his boy know as you was my father?\" Neefit turned on his bed and groaned. He was too ill at ease as to his inner man to argue the subject from a high point of view, or to assert that he was content to be abased himself in order that his child and grandchildren might be raised in the world. \"Father,\" said Polly, \"you have always been kind to me. Be kind to me now.\" \n \n \"The young \u0027uns is always to have their own way,\" said Neefit. \n \n \"Hasn\u0027t my way been your way, father?\" \n \n \"Not when you wouldn\u0027t take the Captain when he come to Margate.\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t love him, father. Dear father, say the word. We haven\u0027t been happy lately;—have we, father?\" \n \n \"I ain\u0027t been very \u0027appy,\" said Neefit, bursting out into sobs. \n \n She put her face upon his brow and kissed it. \"Father, let us be happy again. Ontario is down-stairs,—in the parlour now.\" \n \n \"Ontario Moggs in my parlour!\" said Neefit, jumping up in bed. \n \n \"Yes, father; Ontario Moggs,—my husband, as will be; the man I honour and love; the man that will honour and love you; as true a fellow as ever made a young woman happy by taking her. Let me tell him that you will have him for a son.\" In truth, Neefit did not speak the word;—but when Polly left the room, which she presently did after a long embrace, Mr. Neefit was aware that his consent to the union would be conveyed to Ontario Moggs in less than five minutes. \n \n \"And now you can name the day,\" said Ontario. \n \n \"I cannot do any such thing,\" replied Polly; \"and I think that quite enough has been settled for one morning. It\u0027s give an inch and take an ell with some folks.\" \n \n Ontario waited for breakfast, and had an interview with his future father-in-law. It was an hour after the scene up-stairs before Mr. Neefit could descend, and when he did come down he was not very jovial at the breakfast-table. \"It isn\u0027t what I like, Moggs,\" was the first word that he spoke when the young politician rose to grasp the hand of his future father-in-law. \n \n \"I hope you\u0027ll live to like it, Mr. Neefit,\" said Ontario, who, now that he was to have his way in regard to Polly, was prepared to disregard entirely any minor annoyances. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know how that may be. I think my girl might have done better. I told her so, and I just tell you the same. She might a\u0027 done a deal better, but women is always restive.\" \n \n \"We like to have our own way about our young men, father,\" said Polly, who was standing behind her father\u0027s chair. \n \n \"Bother young men,\" said the breeches-maker. After that the interview passed off, if not very pleasantly, at least smoothly,—and it was understood that Mr. Neefit was to abandon that system of persecution against Ralph Newton, to which his life had been devoted for the last few weeks. \n \n After that there was a pretty little correspondence between Polly and Ralph, with which the story of Polly\u0027s maiden life may be presumed to be ended, and which shall be given to the reader, although by doing so the facts of our tale will be somewhat anticipated. Polly, with her father\u0027s permission, communicated the fact of her engagement to her former lover. \n \n \n Hendon, Saturday. \n \n Dear Sir,— \n \n Father thinks it best that I should tell you that I am engaged to marry Mr. Ontario Moggs,—whom you will remember. He is a most respectable tradesman, and stood once for a member of Parliament, and I think he will make me quite happy; and I\u0027m quite sure that\u0027s what I\u0027m fitted for. \n \n \n Whether Polly meant that she was fitted to be made happy, or fitted to be the wife of a tradesman who stood for Parliament, did not appear quite clearly. \n \n \n There have been things which we are very sorry for, and hope you\u0027ll forgive and forget. Father bids me say how sorry he is he broke a figure of a pretty little man in your room. He would get another, only he would not know where to go for it. \n \n Wishing you always may be happy, believe me to remain, \n \n Yours most respectfully, \n \n Maryanne Neefit. \n \n \n Ralph\u0027s answer was dated about a fortnight afterwards;— \n \n \n —, Cavendish Square, 1 June, 186—. \n \n My dear Polly,— \n \n I hope you will allow me to call you so now for the last time. I am, indeed, happy that you are going to be married. I believe Mr. Moggs to be a most excellent fellow. I hope I may often see him,—and sometimes you. He must allow you to accept a little present which I send you, and never be jealous if you wear it at your waist. \n \n The pretty little man that your father broke by accident in my rooms did not signify at all. Pray tell him so from me. \n \n Believe me to be your very sincere friend, \n \n Ralph Newton. \n \n I may as well tell you my own secret. I am going to be married, too. The young lady lives in this house, and her name is Augusta Eardham. \n \n \n This letter was sent by messenger from Cavendish Square, with a very handsome watch and chain. A month afterwards, when he was preparing to leave London for Brayboro\u0027 Park, he received a little packet, with a note as follows;— \n \n \n Linton, Devonshire, Wednesday. \n \n Dear Mr. Newton,— \n \n I am so much obliged for the watch, and so is Ontario, who will never be jealous, I\u0027m sure. It is a most beautiful thing, and I shall value it, oh! so much. I am very glad you are going to be married, and should have answered before, only I wanted to finish making with my own hand a little chain which I send you. And I hope your sweetheart won\u0027t be jealous either. We looked her out in a book, and found she is the daughter of a great gentleman with a title. That is all just as it should be. Ontario sends his respects. We have come down here for the honeymoon. \n \n I remain, yours very sincerely, \n \n Maryanne Moggs. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2745/75640.html","bookId":1376,"book":{"id":1376,"title":"Ralph the Heir","description":"简介： There are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there are also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise.
