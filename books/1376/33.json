{"id":36801,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. \"TELL ME AND I\u0027LL TELL YOU.\"","content":"\"Papa has told me all about it,\" were Clarissa\u0027s first words as soon as they were out of the gate on the road to Mrs. Brownlow\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All about what, Clary?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh you know;—or rather it was Patience told me, and then I asked papa. I am so glad.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mary had as yet hardly had time to think whether the coming of this letter to her uncle would or would not be communicated to her cousins; but had she thought, she would have been almost sure that Sir Thomas would be more discreet. The whole matter was to her so important, so secret, almost so solemn, that she could hardly imagine that it should be discussed among the whole household. And yet she felt a strong longing within herself to be able to talk of it to some one. Of the two cousins Clary was certainly her favourite, and had she been forced to consult any one, she would have consulted Clary. But an absolute confidence in such a matter with a chosen friend, the more delightful it might appear, was on that very account the more difficult of attainment. It was an occasion for thought, for doubt, and almost for dismay; and now Clary rushed into it as though everything could be settled in a walk from Fulham to Parson\u0027s Green! \"It is very good of you to be glad, Clary,\" said the other,—hardly knowing why she said this, and yet meaning it. If in truth Clary was glad, it was good of her. For this man to whom Clary was alluding had won from her own lover all his inheritance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I like him so much. You will let me talk about him; won\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" said Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do; pray do. There are so many reasons why we should tell each other everything.\" This elicited no promise from Mary. \"If I thought that you would care, I would tell you all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I care about everything that concerns you, Clary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I didn\u0027t bring you out to talk about myself now. I want to tell you how much I like your Ralph Newton.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But he isn\u0027t mine.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes he is;—at any rate, if you like to have him. And of course you will like. Why should you not? He is everything that is nice and good;—and now he is to be the owner of all the property. What I want to tell you is this; I do not begrudge it to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Why should Clarissa begrudge or not begrudge the property? Mary understood it all, but nothing had been said entitling her to speak as though she understood it. \"I don\u0027t think you would begrudge me anything that you thought good for me,\" said Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I think that Mr. Ralph Newton,—this Mr. Ralph Newton, is very good for you. Nothing could be so good. In the first place would it not be very nice to have you mistress of Newton Priory? Only that shouldn\u0027t come properly first.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what should come first, Clary?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh,—of course that you should love him better than anything in the world. And you do,—don\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is too sudden to say that yet, Clary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I am sure you will. Don\u0027t you feel that you will? Come, Mary, you should tell me something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is so little to tell.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you are afraid of me. I wanted to tell you everything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am not afraid of you. But, remember, it is hardly more than an hour ago since I first heard of Mr. Newton\u0027s wishes, and up to that moment nothing was further from my dreams.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was sure of it, ever so long ago,\" said Clarissa. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Clary!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was. I told Patience how it was to be. I saw it in his eyes. One does see these things. I knew it would be so; and I told Patience that we three would be three Mrs. Newtons. But that of course was nonsense.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nonsense, indeed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean about Patience.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what about yourself, Clary?\" Clarissa made no answer, and yet she was burning to tell her own story. She was most anxious to tell her own story, but only on the condition of reciprocal confidence. The very nature of her story required that the confidence should be reciprocal. \"You said that you wanted to tell me everything,\" said Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know how glad I shall be to hear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is all very well, but,—\" And then Clarissa paused. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what, dear?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You do mean to accept Mr. Newton?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Now it was time for Mary to pause. \"If I were to tell you my whole heart,\" she said, \"I should be ashamed of what I was saying; and yet I do not know that there is any cause for shame.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There can be none,\" said Clary. \"I am sure of that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My acquaintance with Mr. Newton is very, very slight. I liked him,—oh, so much. I thought him to be high-spirited, manly, and a fine gentleman. I never saw any man who so much impressed me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course not,\" said Clarissa, making a gesture as though she would stop on the high road and clasp her hands together, in which, however, she was impeded by her parasol and her remembrance of her present position. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it is so much to say that one will love a man better than all the world, and go to him, and belong to him, and be his wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah;—but if one does love him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can hardly believe that love can grow so quickly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell the truth, Mary; has it not grown?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed I cannot say. There; you shall have the whole truth. When he comes to me,—and I suppose he will come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There isn\u0027t much doubt of that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If he does come—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hardly know what I shall say to him. I shall try to—to love him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course you will love him,—better than all the world.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know that he is paying me the greatest compliment that a man can pay to a woman. And there is no earthly reason why I should not be proud to accept all that he offers me. I have nothing of my own to bestow in return.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you are so beautiful.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mary would make no pretence of denying this. It was true that that one great feminine possession did belong to her. \"After all,\" she said, \"how little does beauty signify! It attracts, but it can make no man happy. He has everything to give to a wife, and he ought to have much in return for what he gives.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t mean that a girl should refuse a rich man because she has no fortune of her own?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; not quite that. But she ought to think whether she can be of use to him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course you will be of use, my dear;—of the greatest use in the world. That\u0027s his affair, and he is the best judge of what will be of use. You will love him, and other men will envy him, and that will be everything. Oh dear, I do so hope he will come soon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I,—I almost hope he will not. I shall be so afraid to see him. The first meeting will be so awful. I shall not dare to look him in the face.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it is all settled.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No;—not settled, Clary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; it is settled. And now I will tell you what I mean when I say I do not begrudge him to you. That is—; I do not know whether you will care to be told.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I care very much, Clary. I should be very unhappy if you did begrudge me anything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course you know that our Ralph Newton, as we call him, ought to have been the heir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I needn\u0027t explain it all; only,—only—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only he is everything to you. Is it that, Clary?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; it is that. He is everything to me. I love him—. Oh, yes, I do love him! But, Mary, I am not such a happy girl as you are. Sometimes I think he hardly cares for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But he has asked you to care for him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well;—I don\u0027t know. I think he has. He has told me, I know, that he loved me dearly,—better than any one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what answer did you make to him, Clary?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Clarissa had the whole scene on the lawn at Popham Villa so clearly impressed upon her memory, that an eternity of years, as she thought, could obliterate no one of its incidents and render doubtful no tone of his voice, no word that her lover had spoken. His conduct had at that time been so violent that she had answered him only with tears and protestations of undying anger. But her tears had been dried, and her anger had passed away;—while the love remained. Ralph, her Ralph, of course knew well enough that the tears were dry and the anger gone. She could understand that he would understand that. But the love which he had protested, if it were real love, would remain. And why should she doubt him? The very fact that he was so dear to her, made such doubts almost disgraceful. And yet there was so much cause for doubt. Patience doubted. She knew herself that she feared more than she hoped. She had resolved gallantly that she would be true to her own heart, even though by such truth she should be preparing for herself a life of disappointment. She had admitted the passion, and she would stand by it. In all her fears, too, she consoled herself by the reflection that her lover was hindered, not by want of earnestness or want of truth,—but by the state of his affairs. While he was still in debt, striving to save his inheritance, but tormented by the growing certainty that it must pass away from him, how could he give himself up to love-making and preparations for marriage? Clary made excuses for him which no one else would have made, and so managed to feed her hopes. \"I made him no answer,\" she said at last. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And yet you knew you loved him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I knew that. I can tell you, and I told Patience. But I could not tell him.\" She paused a moment thinking whether she could describe the whole scene; but she found that she could not do that. \"I shall tell him, perhaps, when he comes again; that is, if he does come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If he loves you he will come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. He has all these troubles on him, and he will be very poor;—what will seem to him to be very poor. It would not be poor for me, but for him it would.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Would that hinder him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can I say? There are so many things a girl cannot know. He may still be in debt, and then he has been brought up to want so much. But it will make no more difference in me. And now you will understand why I should tell you that I will never begrudge you your good fortune. If all should come right, you shall give us a little cottage near your grand house, and you will not despise us.\" Poor Clary, when she spoke of her possible future lord, and the little cottage on the Newton demesne, hardly understood the feelings with which a disinherited heir must regard the property which he has lost. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear, dearest Clary,\" said Mary Bonner, pressing her cousin\u0027s arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n They had now reached Mrs. Brownlow\u0027s house, and the old lady was delighted to receive them. Of course she began to discuss at once the great news. Sir Thomas had had his arm broken, and was now again a member of Parliament. Mrs. Brownlow was a thorough-going Tory, and was in an ecstasy of delight that her old friend should have been successful. The success seemed to be so much the greater in that the hero had suffered a broken bone. And then there were many questions to be asked? Would Sir Thomas again be Solicitor-General by right of his seat in Parliament?—for on such matters Mrs. Brownlow was rather hazy in her conceptions as to the working of the British Constitution. And would he live at home? Clarissa would not say that she and Patience expected such a result. All that she could suggest of comfort on this matter was that there would be now something of a fair cause for excusing their father\u0027s residence at his London chambers. \\n\\n \\n\\n But there was a subject more enticing to the old lady even than Sir Thomas\u0027s triumphs; a subject as to which there could not be any triumph,—only dismay; but not, on that account, the less interesting. Ralph Newton had sold his inheritance. \"I believe it is all settled,\" said Clarissa, demurely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear, dear, dear, dear!\" groaned the old lady. And while she groaned Clarissa furtively cast a smile upon her cousin. \"It is the saddest thing I ever knew,\" said Mrs. Brownlow. \"And, after all, for a young man who never can be anybody, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh yes,\" said Clarissa, \"he can be somebody.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know what I mean, my dear. I think it very shocking, and very wrong. Such a fine estate, too!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We all like Mr. Newton very much indeed,\" said Clarissa. \"Papa thinks he is a most charming young man. I never knew papa taken with any one so much. And so do we all,—Patience and I,—and Mary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, my dear,\" began Mrs. Brownlow,—Mrs. Brownlow had always thought that Ralph the heir would ultimately marry Clarissa Underwood, and that it was a manifest duty on his part to do so. She had fancied that Clarissa had expected it herself, and had believed that all the Underwoods would be broken-hearted at this transfer of the estate. \"I don\u0027t think it can be right,\" said Mrs. Brownlow; \"and I must say that it seems to me that old Mr. Newton ought to be ashamed of himself. Just because this young man happens to be, in a sort of a way, his own son, he is going to destroy the whole family. I think that it is very wicked.\" But she had not a word of censure for the heir who had consumed his mess of pottage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wasn\u0027t she grand?\" said Clary, as soon as they were out again upon the road. \"She is such a dear old woman, but she doesn\u0027t understand anything. I couldn\u0027t help giving you a look when she was abusing our friend. When she knows it all, she\u0027ll have to make you such an apology.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope she will not do that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She will if she does not forget all about it. She does forget things. There is one thing I don\u0027t agree with her in at all. I don\u0027t see any shame in your Ralph having the property; and, as to his being nobody, that is all nonsense. He would be somebody, wherever he went, if he had not an acre of property. He will be Mr. Newton, of Newton Priory, just as much as anybody else could be. He has never done anything wrong.\" To all which Mary Bonner had very little to say. She certainly was not prepared to blame the present Squire for having so managed his affairs as to be able to leave the estate to his own son. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two girls were very energetic, and walked back the whole way to Popham Villa, regardless of a dozen omnibuses that passed them. \"I told her all about our Ralph,—my Ralph,\"—said Clary to her sister afterward. \"I could not help telling her now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear Clary,\" said Patience, \"I wish you could help thinking of it always.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s quite impossible,\" said Clarissa, cheerily. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2745/75620.html","bookId":1376,"book":{"id":1376,"title":"Ralph the Heir","description":"简介： There are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there are also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise.
