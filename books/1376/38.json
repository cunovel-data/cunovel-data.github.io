{"id":36806,"no":38,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVIII. FOR TWO REASONS.","content":"The young Squire, as soon as Neefit had left him in his own sitting-room at the Moonbeam, sat himself down and began to think over his affairs seriously. One thing was certain to him;—nothing on earth should induce him to offer his hand again to Polly Neefit. He had had a most miraculous escape, and assuredly would run no further risk in that direction. But though he had escaped, he could perceive that there was considerable trouble before him,—considerable trouble and perhaps some disgrace. It certainly could not be proved against him that he had broken any promise, as there had been no engagement; but it could be made public that he had twice offered himself to Polly, and could also be made public that he had borrowed the breeches-maker\u0027s money. He kept himself alone on that evening; and though he hunted on the following day, he was not found to be a lively companion either by Cox or Pepper. The lieutenant was talking about Neefit and Neefit\u0027s daughter all day: but Mr. Pepper, who was more discreet, declined to canvass the subject. \"It\u0027s nothing to me who a man marries and who he don\u0027t,\" said Mr. Pepper. \"What sort of horses he rides;—that\u0027s what I look at.\" During this day and the next Ralph did consider the state of his affairs very closely, and the conclusion he came to was this, that the sooner he could engage himself to marry Mary Bonner the better. If he were once engaged, the engagement would not then be broken off because of any previous folly with Miss Neefit; and, again, if he were once engaged to Mary Bonner, Neefit would see the absurdity of torturing him further in regard to Polly. On the Wednesday evening he went up to town, and on the Thursday morning he put himself into a cab and ordered the man to drive him to Popham Villa. It was about noon when he started from town; and though he never hesitated,—did not pause for a moment after he had made up his mind as to the thing that he would do, still he felt many misgivings as he was driven down to Fulham. How should he begin his story to Mary Bonner, and how should he look Clary Underwood in the face? And yet he had not an idea that he was in truth going to behave badly to Clarissa. There had no doubt been a sort of tenderness in the feeling that had existed between them,—a something just a little warmer than brotherly regard. They had been thrown together and had liked each other. And as he was driven nearer to the villa, he remembered distinctly that he had kissed her on the lawn. But did any one suppose that a man was bound to marry the first girl he kissed,—or if not the first, then why the second, or the third? Clarissa could have no fair ground of complaint against him; and yet he was uneasy as he reflected that she too must know the purport of his present visit to the villa. And he was not quite easy about Mary. The good things which he carried in his hand were so many that he did not conceive that Mary would refuse him; but yet he wished that the offer had been made, and had been accepted. Hitherto he had taken pleasure in his intercourse with young ladies, and had rather enjoyed the excitement of those moments which to some men are troublesome and even painful. When he had told Clarissa that she was dearer than any one else, he had been very happy while he was telling her. There had been nothing of embarrassment to him in the work of proposing to Polly Neefit. There may perhaps have been other passages in his life of the same nature, and he certainly had not feared them beforehand or been ashamed of them afterwards. But now he found himself endeavouring to think what words he would use to Mary Bonner, and in what attitude he would stand or sit as he used them. \"The truth is,\" he said to himself, \"a man should do these kind of things without premeditation.\" But not the less was he resolved, and at the gate he jumped out of his cab with a determination to have it over as soon as possible. He desired the cabman to wait for him at the nearest stables, remarking that he might be there for a few minutes, or for a few hours, and then turned to the gate. As he did so, he saw Sir Thomas walking from the direction of Fulham Bridge. Sir Thomas had come down by the railway on the other side of the river, and was now walking home. A sudden thought struck the young Squire. He would begin his work by telling his tale to Sir Thomas. There could be nothing so fitting as that he should obtain the uncle\u0027s leave to address the niece. The two men greeted each other, and there were many things to be said. Sir Thomas had not seen his ward since the old Squire\u0027s death, and Ralph had not seen Sir Thomas since the election at Percycross and the accident of the broken arm. Sir Thomas was by far too reticent, too timid, and too reflective a man to begin at once whatever observations he might have to make ultimately in regard to Miss Polly Neefit. He was somewhat slow of speech, unless specially aroused, and had hardly received the congratulations of his young friend respecting the election, and expressed with some difficult decency his sorrow for the old Squire\u0027s death as combined with his satisfaction that the estate had not been sacrificed, when Ralph stopped him just as they had reached the front door, and, with much solemnity of manner, declared his wish to make a very particular private communication to Sir Thomas. \"Certainly,\" said Sir Thomas, \"certainly. Come into my room.\" But there was some delay before this privacy could be achieved, for in the hall they were met by the three girls, and of course there were many things to be said by them. Clarissa could hardly repress the flutter of her heart. When the reader last saw her flutter, and last heard her words as she spoke of her love to her cousin, she was taking an opportunity of declaring to Mary Bonner that she did not begrudge the brilliance of Mary\u0027s present prospects,—though the grand estate which made them brilliant was in a measure taken from her own hopes. And she had owned at the same time that she did not dare to feel confidence in her own love, because her lover would now be too poor in his own esteem to indulge himself with the luxury of a wife. All this Mary had accepted from her, certainly with no expression of triumph, but certainly with some triumph in her heart. Now this was entirely changed,—and here was her lover, with his fortune restored to him, once more beneath her father\u0027s roof! She gave him her hand the first of the three. She could not repress herself. He took it with a smile, and pressed it warmly. But he turned to Patience and took hers as rapidly as he was able. Then came Mary\u0027s turn. \"I hope you also are glad to see me once again?\" he said. Clarissa\u0027s heart sank within her as she heard the words. The appreciation of a woman in such matters is as fine as the nose of a hound, and is all but unintelligible to a man. \"Oh, yes, Mr. Newton,\" said Mary smiling. \"But if he asks her, she\u0027ll take him.\" No such words as these were formed even in Clarissa\u0027s mind; but after some fashion such was the ejaculation of her heart. Mary\u0027s \"Oh, yes,\" had meant little enough, but could Mary withstand such chances if they were offered to her? Sir Thomas led the way into his private room, and Ralph followed him. \"You won\u0027t be long, papa,\" said Patience. \"I hope not,\" said Sir Thomas. \"Remember, Ralph, you will be keeping lunch waiting,\" said Patience. Then the two men were alone. Sir Thomas\u0027s mind had recurred to Neefit at the first moment of Ralph\u0027s request. The young man was going to consult him as to the best mode of getting rid of that embarrassment. But in the hall another idea had come upon him. He was to be asked for his consent regarding Clarissa. As he seated himself in one chair and asked Ralph to take another, he had not quite made up his mind as to the answer he would give. There must at any rate be some delay. The reader will of course remember that Sir Thomas was persuaded that Ralph had engaged himself to marry Polly Neefit. Ralph rushed boldly at his subject at once. \"Sir Thomas,\" he said, \"I am going to make a proposition, and I wish to ask you for your consent. I have made up my mind that the sooner I marry in my present condition the better.\" Sir Thomas smiled and assented. \"And I want to know whether you will object to my asking Miss Bonner to be my wife.\" \"Miss Bonner!\" said Sir Thomas, throwing up both his hands. \"Yes, sir;—is there any objection on your part?\" Sir Thomas hardly knew how to say whether there was or was not an objection on his part. In the first place he had made up his mind that the other Ralph was to marry Mary,—that he would do so in spite of that disclaimer which had been made in the first moment of the young man\u0027s disinheritance. He, Sir Thomas, however, could have no right to object on that score. Nor could he raise any objection on the score of Clarissa. It did seem to him that all the young people were at cross purposes, that Patience must have been very stupid and Clarissa most addlepated, or else that this Ralph was abominably false; but still, he could say nothing respecting that. No tale had reached his ears which made it even possible for him to refer to Clarissa. But yet he was dissatisfied with the man, and was disposed to show it. \"Perhaps I ought to tell you,\" said Sir Thomas, \"that a man calling himself Neefit was with me yesterday.\" \"Oh, yes; the breeches-maker.\" \"I believe he said that such was his trade. He assured me that you had borrowed large sums of money from him.\" \"I do owe him some money.\" \"A thousand pounds, I think he said.\" \"Certainly as much as that.\" \"Not for breeches,—which I suppose would be impossible, but for money advanced.\" \"Part one and part the other,\" said Ralph. \"And he went on to tell me that you were engaged,—to marry his daughter.\" \"That is untrue.\" \"Were you never engaged to her?\" \"I was never engaged to her, Sir Thomas.\" \"And it was all a lie on the part of Mr. Neefit? Was there no foundation for it? You had told me yourself that you thought of such a marriage.\" \"There is nothing to justify him in saying that I was ever engaged to the young lady. The truth is that I did ask her and she,—refused me.\" \"You did ask her?\" \"I did ask her,\" said Ralph. \"In earnest?\" \"Well; yes;—certainly in earnest. At that time I thought it the only way to save the property. I need not tell you how wretched I was at the time. You will remember what you yourself had said to me. It is true that I asked her, and that I did so by agreement with her father. She refused me,—twice. She was so good, so sensible, and so true, that she knew she had better not make herself a party to such a bargain. Whatever you may think of my own conduct I shall not have behaved badly to Miss Neefit.\" Sir Thomas did think very ill of Ralph\u0027s conduct, but he believed him. After a while the whole truth came out, as to the money lent and as to Neefit\u0027s schemes. It was of course understood by both of them that Ralph was required neither by honesty nor by honour to renew his offer. And then under such circumstances was he or was he not to be allowed to propose to Mary Bonner? At first Ralph had been much dismayed at having the Neefit mine sprung on him at such a moment; but he collected himself very quickly, and renewed his demand as to Mary. Sir Thomas could not mean to say that because he had been foolish in regard to Polly Neefit, that therefore he was to be debarred from marrying! Sir Thomas did not exactly say that; but, nevertheless, Sir Thomas showed his displeasure. \"It seems,\" said he, \"particularly easy to you to transfer your affections.\" \"My affection for Miss Neefit was not strong,\" said Ralph. \"I did, and always shall, regard her as a most excellent young woman.\" \"She showed her sense in refusing you,\" said Sir Thomas. \"I think she did,\" said Ralph. \"And I doubt much whether my niece will not be equally—sensible.\" \"Ah,—I can say nothing as to that.\" \"Were she to hear this story of Miss Neefit I am sure she would refuse you.\" \"But you would not tell it to her,—as yet! If all goes well with me I will tell it to her some day. Come, Sir Thomas, you don\u0027t mean to be hard upon me at last. It cannot be that you should really regret that I have got out of that trouble.\" \"But I regret much that you should have borrowed a tradesman\u0027s money, and more that you should have offered to pay the debt by marrying his daughter.\" Through it all, however, there was a feeling present to Sir Thomas that he was, in truth, angry with the Squire of Newton, not so much for his misconduct in coming to propose to Mary so soon after the affair with Polly Neefit, but because he had not come to propose to Clarissa. And Sir Thomas knew that such a feeling, if it did really exist, must be overcome. Mary was entitled to her chance, and must make the best of it. He would not refuse his sanction to a marriage with his niece on account of Ralph\u0027s misconduct, when he would have sanctioned a marriage with his own daughter in spite of that misconduct. The conversation was ended by Sir Thomas leaving the room with a promise that Miss Bonner should be sent to fill his place. In five minutes Miss Bonner was there. She entered the room very slowly, with a countenance that was almost savage, and during the few minutes that she remained there she did not sit down. \"Sir Thomas has told you why I am here?\" he said, advancing towards her, and taking her hand. \"No; that is;—no. He has not told me.\" \"Mary—\" \"Mr. Newton, my name is Miss Bonner.\" \"And must it between us be so cold as that?\" He still had her by the hand, which she did not at the moment attempt to withdraw. \"I have come to tell you, at the first moment that was possible to me after my uncle\u0027s death, that of all women in the world I love you the best.\" Then she withdrew her hand. \"Mr. Newton, I am sorry to hear you say so;—very sorry.\" \"Why should you be sorry? If you are unkind to me like this, there may be reason why I should be sorry. I shall, indeed, be very sorry. Since I first saw you, I have hoped that you would be my wife.\" \"I never can be your wife, Mr. Newton.\" \"Why not? Have I done anything to offend you? Being here as one of the family you must know enough of my affairs to feel sure,—that I have come to you the first moment that was possible. I did not dare to come when I thought that my position was one that was not worthy of you.\" \"It would have been the same at any time,\" said Mary. \"And why should you reject me,—like this; without a moment\u0027s thought?\" \"For two reasons,\" said Mary, slowly, and then she paused, as though doubting whether she would continue her speech, or give the two reasons which now guided her. But he stood, looking into her face, waiting for them. \"In the first place,\" she said, \"I think you are untrue to another person.\" Then she paused again, as though asking herself whether that reason would not suffice. But she resolved that she would be bold, and give the other. \"In the next place, my heart is not my own to give.\" \"Is it so?\" asked Ralph. \"I have said as much as can be necessary,—perhaps more, and I would rather go now.\" Then she left the room with the same slow, stately step, and he saw her no more on that day. Then in those short five minutes Sir Thomas had absolutely told her the whole story about Polly Neefit, and she had come to the conclusion that because in his trouble he had offered to marry a tradesman\u0027s daughter, therefore he was to be debarred from ever receiving the hand of a lady! That was the light in which he looked upon Mary\u0027s first announcement. As to the second announcement he was absolutely at a loss. There must probably, he thought, have been some engagement before she left Jamaica. Not the less on that account was it an act of unpardonable ill-nature on the part of Sir Thomas,—that telling of Polly Neefit\u0027s story to Mary Bonner at such a moment. He was left alone for a few minutes after Mary\u0027s departure, and then Patience came to him. Would he stay for dinner? Even Patience was very cold to him. Sir Thomas was fatigued and was lying down, but would see him, of course, if he wished it. \"And where is Clarissa?\" asked Ralph. Patience said that Clarissa was not very well. She also was lying down. \"I see what it is,\" said Ralph, turning upon her angrily. \"You are, all of you, determined to quarrel with me because of my uncle\u0027s death.\" \"I do not see why that should make us quarrel,\" said Patience. \"I do not know that any one has quarrelled with you.\" Of course he would not wait for dinner, nor would he have any lunch. He walked out on to the lawn with something of a bluster in his step, and stood there for three or four minutes looking up at the house and speaking to Patience. A young man when he has been rejected by one of the young ladies of a family has rather a hard time of it till he gets away. \"Well, Patience,\" he said at last, \"make my farewells for me.\" And then he was gone.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2745/75625.html","bookId":1376,"book":{"id":1376,"title":"Ralph the Heir","description":"简介： There are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there are also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise.
