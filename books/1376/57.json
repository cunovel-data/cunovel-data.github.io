{"id":36825,"no":57,"title":"CHAPTER LVII. CLARISSA\u0027S FATE.","content":"In the following October, while Newton of Newton and his bride were making themselves happy amidst the glories of Florence, she with her finery from Paris, and he with a newly-acquired taste for Michael Angelo and the fine arts generally, Gregory the parson again went up to London. He had, of course, \"assisted\" at his brother\u0027s marriage,—in which the heavy burden of the ceremony was imposed on the shoulders of a venerable dean, who was related to Lady Eardham,—and had since that time been all alone at his parsonage. Occasionally he had heard of the Underwoods from Ralph Newton of Beamingham, whose wedding had been postponed till Beamingham Hall had been made fit for its mistress; and from what he had heard Gregory was induced,—hardly to hope,—but to dream it to be possible that even yet he might prevail in love. An idea had grown upon him, springing from various sources, that Clarissa had not been indifferent to his brother, and that this feeling on her part had marred, and must continue to mar, his own happiness. He never believed that there had been fault on his brother\u0027s part; but still, if Clarissa had been so wounded,—he could hardly hope,—and perhaps should not even wish,—that she would consent to share with him his parsonage in the close neighbourhood of his brother\u0027s house. During all that September he told himself that the thing should be over, and he began to teach himself,—to try to teach himself,—that celibacy was the state in which a clergyman might best live and do his duty. But the lesson had not gone far with him before he shook himself, and determined that he would try yet once again. If there had been such a wound, why should not the wound be cured? Clarissa was at any rate true. She would not falsely promise him a heart, when it was beyond her power to give it. In October, therefore, he went again up to London. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cases for packing the books had not even yet been made, and Sir Thomas was found in Southampton Buildings. The first words had, of course, reference to the absent Squire. The squire of one\u0027s parish, the head of one\u0027s family, and one\u0027s elder brother, when the three are united in the same personage, will become important to one, even though the personage himself be not heroic. Ralph had written home twice, and everything was prospering with him. Sir Thomas, who had become tired of his late ward, and who had thought worse of the Eardham marriage than the thing deserved, was indifferent to the joys of the Italian honeymoon. \"They\u0027ll do very well, no doubt,\" said Sir Thomas. \"I was delighted to learn that Augusta bore her journey so well,\" said Gregory. \"Augustas always do bear their journeys well,\" said Sir Thomas; \"though sometimes, I fancy, they find the days a little too long.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But his tone was very different when Gregory asked his leave to make one more attempt at Popham Villa. \"I only hope you may succeed,—for her sake, as well as for your own,\" said Sir Thomas. But when he was asked as to the parson\u0027s chance of success, he declared that he could say nothing. \"She is changed, I think, from what she used to be,—is more thoughtful, perhaps, and less giddy. It may be that such change will turn her towards you.\" \"I would not have her changed in anything,\" said Gregory,—\"except in her feelings towards myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He had been there twice or thrice before he found what he thought to be an opportunity fit for the work that he had on hand. And yet both Patience and Mary did for him and for her all that they knew how to do. But in such a matter it is so hard to act without seeming to act! She who can man?uvre on such a field without displaying her man?uvres is indeed a general! No man need ever attempt the execution of a task so delicate. Mary and Patience put their heads together, and resolved that they would say nothing. Nor did they manifestly take steps to leave the two alone together. It was a question with them, especially with Patience, whether the lover had not come too soon. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Clarissa at last attacked her sister. \"Patience,\" she said, \"why do you not speak to me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not speak to you, Clary?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a word,—about that which is always on my mind. You have not mentioned Ralph Newton\u0027s name once since his marriage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have thought it better not to mention it. Why should I mention it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you think that it would pain me, you are mistaken. It pains me more that you should think that I could not bear it. He was welcome to his wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know you wish him well, Clary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well! Oh, yes, I wish him well. No doubt he will be happy with her. She is fit for him, and I was not. He did quite right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is not half so good as his brother,\" said Patience. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly he is not so good as his brother. Men, of course, will be different. But it is not always the best man that one likes the best. It ought to be so, perhaps.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know which I like the best,\" said Patience. \"Oh, Clary, if you could but bring yourself to love him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How is one to change like that? And I do not know that he cares for me now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah;—I think he cares for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should he? Is a man to be sacrificed for always because a girl will not take him? His heart is changed. He takes care to show me so when he comes here. I am glad that it should be changed. Dear Patty, if papa would but come and live at home, I should want nothing else.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I want something else,\" said Patience. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I want nothing but that you should love me;—and that papa should be with us. But, Patty, do not make me feel that you are afraid to speak to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n On the day following Gregory was again at Fulham, and he had come thither fully determined that he would now for the last time ask that question, on the answer to which, as it now seemed to him, all his future happiness must depend. He had told himself that he would shake off this too human longing for a sweet face to be ever present with him at his board, for a sweet heart to cherish him with its love, for a dear head to lie upon his bosom. But he had owned to himself that it could not be shaken off, and having so owned, was more sick than ever with desire. Mary and Clarissa were both out when he arrived, and he was closeted for a while with Patience. \"How tired you must be of seeing me,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tired of seeing you? Oh no!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I feel myself to be going about like a phantom, and I am ashamed of myself. My brother is successful and happy, and has all that he desires.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is easily satisfied,\" said Patience, with something of sarcasm in her voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And my cousin Ralph is happy and triumphant. I ought not to pine, but in truth I am so weak that I am always pining. Tell me at once,—is there a chance for me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Did it occur to him to think that she to whom he was speaking, ever asked herself why it was not given to her to have even a hope of that joy for which he was craving? Did she ever pine because, when others were mating round her, flying off in pairs to their warm mutual nests, there came to her no such question of mating and flying off to love and happiness? If there was such pining, it was all inward, hidden from her friends so that their mirth should not be lessened by her want of mirth, not expressed either by her eye or mouth because she knew that on the expression of her face depended somewhat of the comfort of those who loved her. A homely brow, and plain features, and locks of hair that have not been combed by Love\u0027s attendant nymphs into soft and winning tresses, seems to tell us that Love is not wanted by the bosom that owns them. We teach ourselves to regard such a one, let her be ever so good, with ever so sweet temper, ever so generous in heart, ever so affectionate among her friends, as separated alike from the perils and the privileges of that passion without which they who are blessed or banned with beauty would regard life but as a charred and mutilated existence. It is as though we should believe that passion springs from the rind, which is fair or foul to the eye, and not in the heart, which is often fairest, freshest, and most free, when the skin is dark and the cheeks are rough. This young parson expected Patience to sympathise with him, to greet for him, to aid him if there might be aid, and to understand that for him the world would be blank and wretched unless he could get for himself a soft sweet mate to sing when he sang, and to wail when he wailed. The only mate that Patience had was this very girl that was to be thus taken from her. But she did sympathise with him, did greet for him, did give him all her aid. Knowing what she was herself and how God had formed her, she had learned to bury self absolutely and to take all her earthly joy from the joys of others. Shall it not come to pass that, hereafter, she too shall have a lover among the cherubim? \"What can I say to you?\" replied Patience to the young man\u0027s earnest entreaty. \"If she were mine to give, I would give her to you instantly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you think there is no chance. If I thought that, why should I trouble her again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not say so. Do you not know, Mr. Newton, that in such matters even sisters can hardly tell their thoughts to each other? How can they when they do not even know their own wishes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She does not hate me then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hate you! no;—she does not hate you. But there are so many degrees between hating and that kind of love which you want from her! You may be sure of this, that she so esteems you that your persistence cannot lessen you in her regard.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was still pleading his case with the elder sister,—very uselessly indeed, as he was aware; but having fallen on the subject of his love it was impossible for him to change it for any other,—when Clarissa came into the room swinging her hat in her hand. She had been over at Miss Spooner\u0027s house and was full of Miss Spooner\u0027s woes and complaints. As soon as she had shaken hands with her lover and spoken the few words of courtesy which the meeting demanded of her, she threw herself into the affairs of Miss Spooner as though they were of vital interest. \"She is determined to be unhappy, Patty, and it is no use trying to make her not so. She says that Jane robs her, which I don\u0027t believe is true, and that Sarah has a lover,—and why shouldn\u0027t Sarah have a lover? But as for curing her grievances, it would be the cruellest thing in the world. She lives upon her grievances. Something has happened to the chimney-pot, and the landlord hasn\u0027t sent a mason. She is revelling in her chimney-pot.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor dear Miss Spooner,\" said Patience, getting up and leaving the room as though it were her duty to look at once after her old friend in the midst of these troubles. \\n\\n \\n\\n Clarissa had not intended this. \"She\u0027s asleep now,\" said Clarissa. But Patience went all the same. It might be that Miss Spooner would require to be watched in her slumbers. When Patience was gone Gregory Newton got up from his seat and walked to the window. He stood there for what seemed to be an endless number of seconds before he returned, and Clarissa had time to determine that she would escape. \"I told Mary that I would go to her,\" she said, \"you won\u0027t mind being left alone for a few minutes, Mr. Newton.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do not go just now, Clarissa.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only that I said I would,\" she answered, pleading that she must keep a promise which she had never made. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mary can spare you,—and I cannot. Mary is staying with you, and I shall be gone,—almost immediately. I go back to Newton to-morrow, and who can say when I shall see you again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You will be coming up to London, of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am here now at any rate,\" he said smiling, \"and will take what advantage of it I can. It is the old story, Clarissa;—so old that I know you must be sick of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you think so, you should not tell it again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do not be ill-natured to me. I don\u0027t know why it is but a man gets to be ashamed of himself, as though he were doing something mean and paltry, when he loves with persistence, as I do.\" Had it been possible that she should give him so much encouragement she would have told him that the mean man, and paltry, was he who could love or pretend to love with no capacity for persistency. She could not fail to draw a comparison between him and his brother, in which there was so much of meanness on the part of him who had at one time been as a god to her, and so much nobility in him to whom she was and ever had been as a goddess. \"I suppose a man should take an answer and have done with it,\" he continued. \"But how is a man to have done with it, when his heart remains the same?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A man should master his heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am, then, to understand that that which you have said so often before must be said again?\" He had never knelt to her, and he did not kneel now; but he leaned over her so that she hardly knew whether he was on his knees or still seated on his chair. And she herself, though she answered him briskly,—almost with impertinence,—was so little mistress of herself that she knew not what she said. She would take him now,—if only she knew how to take him without disgracing herself in her own estimation. \"Dear Clary, think of it. Try to love me. I need not tell you again how true is my love for you.\" He had hold of her hand, and she did not withdraw it, and he ought to have known that the battle was won. But he knew nothing. He hardly knew that her hand was in his. \"Clary, you are all the world to me. Must I go back heart-laden, but empty-handed, with no comfort?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you knew all!\" she said, rising suddenly from her chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you knew all, you would not take me though I offered myself.\" He stood staring at her, not at all comprehending her words, and she perceived in the midst of her distress that it was needful that she should explain herself. \"I have loved Ralph always;—yes, your brother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will not accuse him in anything. He is married now, and it is past.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you can never love again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who would take such a heart as that? It would not be worth the giving or worth the taking. Oh—how I loved him!\" Then he left her side, and went back to the window, while she sank back upon her chair, and, burying her face in her hands, gave way to tears and sobs. He stood there perhaps for a minute, and then returning to her, so gently that she did not hear him, he did kneel at her side. He knelt, and putting his hand upon her arm, he kissed the sleeve of her gown. \"You had better go from me now,\" she said, amidst her sobs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will never go from you again,\" he answered. \"God\u0027s mercy can cure also that wound, and I will be his minister in healing it. Clarissa, I am so glad that you have told me all. Looking back I can understand it now. I once thought that it was so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said, \"yes; it was so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gradually one hand of hers fell into his, and though no word of acceptance had been spoken he knew that he was at last accepted. \"My own Clary,\" he said. \"I may call you my own?\" There was no answer, but he knew that it was so. \"Nothing shall be done to trouble you;—nothing shall be said to press you. You may be sure of this, if it be good to be loved,—that no woman was ever loved more tenderly than you are.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do know it,\" she said, through her tears. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he rose and stood again at the window, looking out upon the lawn and the river. She was still weeping, but he hardly heeded her tears. It was better for her that she should weep than restrain them. And, as to himself and his own feelings,—he tried to question himself, whether, in truth, was he less happy in this great possession, which he had at last gained, because his brother had for a while interfered with him in gaining it? That she would be as true to him now, as tender and as loving, as though Ralph had never crossed her path, he did not for a moment doubt. That she would be less sweet to him because her sweetness had been offered to another he would not admit to himself,—even though the question were asked. She would be all his own, and was she not the one thing in the world which he coveted? He did think that for such a one as his Clarissa he would be a better mate than would have been his brother, and he was sure that she herself would learn to know that it was so. He stood there long enough to resolve that this which had been told him should be no drawback upon his bliss. \"Clary,\" he said, returning to her, \"it is settled?\" She made him no answer. \"My darling, I am as happy now as though Ralph had never seen your sweet face, or heard your dear voice. Look up at me once.\" Slowly she looked up into his eyes, and then stood before him almost as a suppliant, and gave him her face to be kissed. So at last they became engaged as man and wife;—though it may be doubted whether she spoke another word before he left the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was, however, quite understood that they were engaged; and, though he did not see Clarissa again, he received the congratulations both of Patience and Mary Bonner before he left the house; and that very night succeeded in hunting down Sir Thomas, so that he might tell the father that the daughter had at last consented to become his wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2745/75644.html","bookId":1376,"book":{"id":1376,"title":"Ralph the Heir","description":"简介： There are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there are also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise.
