{"id":36775,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII. YOU ARE ONE OF US NOW.","content":"The first week after Mary Bonner\u0027s arrival at Popham Villa went by without much to make it remarkable, except the strangeness arising from the coming of a stranger. Sir Thomas did stay at home on that Sunday, but when the time came for going to morning church, shuffled out of that disagreeable duty in a manner that was satisfactory neither to himself nor his daughters. \"Oh, papa; I thought you would have gone with us!\" said Patience at the last moment. \n \n \"I think not to-day, my dear,\" he said, with that sort of smile which betokens inward uneasiness. Patience reproached him with a look, and then the three girls went off together. Even Patience herself had offered to excuse Mary, on the score of fatigue, seasickness, and the like; but Mary altogether declined to be excused. She was neither fatigued, she said, nor sick; and of course she would go to church. Sir Thomas stayed at home, and thought about himself. How could he go to church when he knew that he could neither listen to the sermon nor join in the prayers? \"I suppose people do,\" he said to himself; \"but I can\u0027t. I\u0027d go to church all day long, if I found that it would serve me.\" \n \n He went up to London on the Monday, and returned to the villa to dinner. He did the same on the Tuesday. On the Wednesday he remained in London. On the Thursday he came home, but dined in town. After that he found himself to be on sufficiently familiar terms with his niece to fall back into his old habits of life. \n \n Patience was very slow in speaking to their cousin of her father\u0027s peculiarities; but Clarissa soon told the tale. \"You\u0027ll get to know papa soon,\" she said. \n \n \"He has been so kind to me.\" \n \n \"He is very good; but you must know, dear, that we are the most deserted and disconsolate ladies that ever lived out of a poem. Papa has been home now four days together; but that is for your beaux yeux. We are here for weeks together without seeing him;—very often for more than a week.\" \n \n \"Where does he go?\" \n \n \"He has a place in London;—such a place! You shall go and see it some day, though he won\u0027t thank us a bit for taking you there. He has the queerest old man to wait upon him, and he never sees anybody from day to day.\" \n \n \"But what does he do?\" \n \n \"He is writing a book. That is the great secret. He never speaks about it, and does not like to be asked questions. But the truth is, he is the most solitude-loving person in the world. He does find its charms, though Alexander Selkirk never could.\" \n \n \"And does nobody come here to you?\" \n \n \"In the way of taking care of us? Nobody! We have to take care of ourselves. Of course it is dull. People do come and see us sometimes. Miss Spooner, for instance.\" \n \n \"Why should you laugh at poor Miss Spooner?\" asked Patience. \n \n \"I don\u0027t laugh at her. We have other friends, you know; but not enough to make the house pleasant to you.\" After that, when Patience was not with them, she told something of Ralph Newton and his visits, though she said nothing to her cousin of her own cherished hopes. \"I wonder what you\u0027ll think of Ralph Newton?\" she said. Ralph Newton\u0027s name had been mentioned before in Mary\u0027s hearing more than once. \n \n \"Why should I think anything particular of Ralph Newton?\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll have to think something particular about him as he is a sort of child of the house. Papa was his guardian, and he comes here just when he pleases.\" \n \n \"Who is he, and what is he, and where is he, and why is he?\" \n \n \"He\u0027s a gentleman at large who does nothing. That\u0027s who he is.\" \n \n \"He thinks ever so much of himself, then?\" \n \n \"No;—he doesn\u0027t. And he is nephew to an old squire down in Hampshire, who won\u0027t give him a penny. He oughtn\u0027t to want it, however, because when he came of age he had ever so much money of his own. But he does want it,—sometimes. He must have the property when his uncle dies.\" \n \n \"Dear me;—how interesting!\" \n \n \"As for the where he is, and why he is,—he comes here just when it suits him, and because we were almost brought up together. He doesn\u0027t dine here, and all that kind of thing, because papa is never at home. Nobody ever does dine here.\" \n \n Then there was a short pause. \"This Mr. Newton isn\u0027t a lover then?\" asked Miss Bonner. \n \n There was another pause before Clarissa could answer the question. \"No,\" she said; \"no; he isn\u0027t a lover. We don\u0027t have any lovers at Popham Villa.\" \"Only that\u0027s not quite true,\" she said, after a pause. \"And as you are to live with us just like a sister, I\u0027ll tell you about Gregory Newton, Ralph\u0027s brother.\" Then she did tell the story of the clergyman\u0027s love and the clergyman\u0027s discomfiture; but she said not a word of Ralph\u0027s declaration and Ralph\u0027s great sin on that fatal evening. And the way in which she told her story about the one brother altogether disarmed Mary Bonner\u0027s suspicion as to the other. \n \n In truth Clarissa did not know whether it was or was not her privilege to regard Ralph Newton as her lover. He had not been to the cottage since that evening; and though the words he had spoken were still sweet in her ears,—so sweet that she could not endure the thought of abandoning their sweetness,—still she had a misgiving that they were in some sort rendered nugatory by his great fault. She had forgiven the fault;—looking back at it now over the distance of eight or ten days, had forgiven it with all her heart; but still there remained with her an undefined and unpleasant feeling that the spoken words, accompanied by a deed so wicked, were absorbed, and, as it were, drowned in the wickedness of the deed. What if the words as first spoken were only a prelude to the deed,—for, as she well remembered, they had been spoken twice,—and if the subsequent words were only an excuse for it! There was a painful idea in her mind that such might possibly be the case, and that if so, the man could never be forgiven, or at least ought never to be spoken to again. Acting on this suggestion from within, she absolutely refused to tell her father what had happened when Patience urged her to do so. \"He\u0027ll come and see papa himself,—if he means anything,\" said Clary. Patience only shook her head. She thought that Sir Thomas should be told at once; but she could not take upon herself to divulge her sister\u0027s secret, which had been imparted to her in trust. \n \n Clarissa was obstinate. She would not tell her father, nor would she say what would be her own answer if her father were to give his permission for the match. As to this Patience had not much doubt. She saw that her sister\u0027s heart was set upon this lover. She had feared it before this late occurrence, and now she could hardly have a doubt. But if Ralph really meant it he would hardly have told her that he loved her, and then not waited for an answer,—not have come back for an answer,—not have gone to their father for an answer. And then, Patience thought, Sir Thomas would never consent to this marriage. Ralph was in debt, and a scapegrace, and quite unfit to undertake the management of a wife. Such was the elder sister\u0027s belief as to her father\u0027s mind. But she could not force upon Clary the necessity of taking any action in the matter. She was not strong enough in her position as elder to demand obedience. Clarissa\u0027s communication had been made in confidence; and Patience, though she was unhappy, would not break the trust. \n \n At last this young Lothario appeared among them again; but, as it happened, he came in company with Sir Thomas. Such a thing had not happened before since the day on which Sir Thomas had given up all charge of his ward\u0027s property. But it did so happen now. The two men had met in London, and Sir Thomas had suggested that Ralph should come and be introduced to the new cousin. \n \n \"What are you doing now?\" Sir Thomas had asked. \n \n \"Nothing particular just at present.\" \n \n \"You can get away this evening?\" \n \n \"Yes,—I think I can get away.\" It had been his intention to dine at his club with Captain Cox; but as he had dined at the club with Captain Cox on the previous day, the engagement was not felt to be altogether binding. \"I can get away for dinner that is, but I\u0027ve got to go out in the evening. It\u0027s a bore, but I promised to be at Lady McMarshal\u0027s to-night. But if I show there at twelve it will do.\" Thus it happened that Sir Thomas and Ralph Newton went down to Popham Villa in a cab together. \n \n It was clear, both to Patience and Clarissa, that he was much struck with the new cousin; but then it was quite out of the question that any man should not be struck with her. Her beauty was of that kind,—like the beauty of a picture,—which must strike even if it fails to charm. And Mary had a way of exciting attention with strangers, even by her silence. It was hardly intentional, and there certainly was no coquetry in it; but it was the case that she carried herself after a fashion which made it impossible for any stranger to regard her place in the room as being merely a chair with a young lady in it. She would speak hardly a word; but her very lack of speech was eloquent. At the present time she was of course in deep mourning, and the contrast between the brilliance of her complexion and the dark dress which covered her throat;—between the black scarf and the profusion of bright hair which fell upon it, was so remarkable as of itself to excite attention. Clarissa, watching everything, though, with feminine instinct, seeming to watch nothing, could see that he was amazed. But then she had known that he would be amazed. And of what matter would be his amazement, if he were true? If, indeed, he were not true,—then, then,—then nothing mattered! Such was the light in which Clary viewed the circumstances around her at the present moment. \n \n The evening did not pass very pleasantly. Ralph was introduced to the cousin, and asked some questions about the West Indies. Then there was tea. Ralph was dressed, with a black coat and white cravat, and Clary could not keep herself from thinking how very much nicer he was with a pipe in his mouth, and his neck bare, drinking soda-water and sherry out on the lawn. Ah,—in spite of all that had then happened, that was the sweetest moment in her existence, when he jumped up from the ground and told her that he might do a great deal better than marry the West Indian cousin. She thought now of his very words, and suggested to herself that perhaps he would never say them again. Nay;—might it not be possible that he would say the very reverse, that he would declare his wish to marry the West Indian cousin. Clary could not conceive but that he might have her should he so wish. Young ladies, when they are in love, are prone to regard their lovers as being prizes so valuable as to be coveted by all female comers. \n \n Before Ralph had taken his leave Sir Thomas took Mary apart to make some communication to her as to her own affairs. Everything was now settled, and Sir Thomas had purchased stock for her with her little fortune. \"You have ￡20 2s. 4d. a year, quite your own,\" he said, laughing;—as he might have done to one of his own girls, had an unexpected legacy been left to her. \n \n \"That means that I must be altogether dependent on your charity,\" she said, looking into his face through her tears. \n \n \"It means nothing of the kind,\" he said, with almost the impetuosity of anger. \"There shall be no such cold word as charity between you and me. You are one of us now, and of my cup and of my loaf it is your right to partake, as it is the right of those girls there. I shall never think of it, or speak of it again.\" \n \n \"But I must think of it, uncle.\" \n \n \"The less the better;—but never use that odious word again between you and me. It is a word for strangers. What is given as I give to you should be taken without even an acknowledgment. My payment is to be your love.\" \n \n \"You shall be paid in full,\" she said as she kissed him. This was all very well, but still on his part there was some misgiving,—some misgiving, though no doubt. If he were to die what would become of her? He must make a new will,—which in itself was to him a terrible trouble; and he must take something from his own girls in order that he might provide for this new daughter. That question of adopting is very difficult. If a man have no children of his own,—none others that are dependent on him,—he can give all, and there is an end of his trouble. But a man feels that he owes his property to his children; and, so feeling, may he take it from them and give it to others? Had she been in truth his daughter, he would have felt that there was enough for three; but she was not his daughter, and yet he was telling her that she should be to him the same as a child of his house! \n \n In the meantime Ralph was out on the lawn with the two sisters, and was as awkward as men always are in such circumstances. When he spoke those words to Clarissa he had in truth no settled purpose in his mind. He had always liked her,—loved her after a fashion,—felt for her an affection different to that which he entertained for her sister. Nevertheless, most assuredly he had not come down to Fulham on that evening prepared to make her an offer. He had been there by chance, and it had been quite by chance that he found Clarissa alone. He knew that the words had been spoken, and he knew also that he had drawn down her wrath upon his head by his caress. He was man enough also to feel that he had no right to believe himself to have been forgiven, because now, in the presence of others, she did not receive him with a special coldness which would have demanded special explanation. As it was, the three were all cold. Patience half felt inclined to go and leave them together. She would have given a finger off her hand to make Clary happy;—but would it be right to make Clary happy in such fashion as this? She had thought at first when she saw her father and Ralph together, that Ralph had spoken of his love to Sir Thomas, and that Sir Thomas had allowed him to come; but she soon perceived that this was not the case: and so they walked about together, each knowing that their intercourse was not as it always had been, and each feeling powerless to resume an appearance of composure. \n \n \"I have got to go and be at Lady McMarshal\u0027s,\" he said, after having suffered in this way for a quarter of an hour. \"If I did not show myself there her ladyship would think that I had given over all ideas of propriety, and that I was a lost sheep past redemption.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t let us keep you if you ought to go,\" said Clary, with dismal propriety. \n \n \"I think I\u0027ll be off. Good-bye, Patience. The new cousin is radiant in beauty. No one can doubt that. But I don\u0027t know whether she is exactly the sort of girl I admire most. By-the-bye, what do you mean to do with her?\" \n \n \"Do with her?\" said Patience. \"She will live here, of course.\" \n \n \"Just settle down as one of the family? Then, no doubt, I shall see her again. Good-night, Patience. Good-bye, Clary. I\u0027ll just step in and make my adieux to Sir Thomas and the beauty.\" This he did;—but as he went he pressed Clary\u0027s hand in a manner that she could but understand. She did not return the pressure, but she did not resent it. \n \n \"Clarissa,\" said Patience, when they were together that night, \"dear Clarissa!\" \n \n Clary knew that when she was called Clarissa by her sister something special was meant. \"What is it?\" she asked. \"What are you going to say now?\" \n \n \"You know that I am thinking only of your happiness. My darling, he doesn\u0027t mean it.\" \n \n \"How do you know? What right have you to say so? Why am I to be thought such a fool as not to know what I ought to do?\" \n \n \"Nobody thinks that you are a fool, Clary. I know how clever you are,—and how good. But I cannot bear that you should be unhappy. If he had meant it, he would have spoken to papa. If you will only tell me that you are not thinking of him, that he is not making you unhappy, I will not say a word further.\" \n \n \"I am thinking of him, and he is making me unhappy,\" said Clarissa, bursting into tears. \"But I don\u0027t know why you should say that he is a liar, and dishonest, and everything that is bad.\" \n \n \"I have neither said that, nor thought it, Clary.\" \n \n \"That is what you mean. He did say that he loved me.\" \n \n \"And you,—you did not answer him?\" \n \n \"No;—I said nothing. I can\u0027t explain it, and I don\u0027t want to explain it. I did not say a word to him. You came; and then he went away. If I am to be unhappy, I can\u0027t help it. He did say that he loved me, and I do love him.\" \n \n \"Will you tell papa?\" \n \n \"No;—I will not. It would be out of the question. He would go to Ralph, and there would be a row, and I would not have it for worlds.\" Then she tried to smile. \"Other girls are unhappy, and I don\u0027t see why I\u0027m to be better off than the rest. I know I am a fool. You\u0027ll never be unhappy, because you are not a fool. But, Patience, I have told you everything, and if you are not true to me I will never forgive you.\" Patience promised that she would be true; and then they embraced and were friends. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2745/75594.html","bookId":1376,"book":{"id":1376,"title":"Ralph the Heir","description":"简介： There are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there are also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise.
