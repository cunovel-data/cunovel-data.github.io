THE PROFITS OF MINING.","content":"A few evenings later Ben and Bradley were sitting just outside the cabin as the twilight deepened. \"It doesn\u0027t seem as if this was our last night in the old shanty,\" said Jake Bradley, taking the pipe from his mouth. \"It ain\u0027t a palace, but I shall kinder hate to leave it.\" \"I\u0027ve got to feel very much at home here myself, Jake; still, I should like to get somewhere where it isn\u0027t quite so far out of the world.\" \"There\u0027s something in that, Ben.\" \"I haven\u0027t heard anything from home for a good many weeks; I wish I knew whether my uncle\u0027s family are all well.\" \"How many is there in the family, Ben?\" \"There\u0027s Uncle Job and Aunt Hannah and Cousin Jennie.\" [Pg 101]\"That\u0027s just what I thought,\" said Jake. \"I don\u0027t understand you,\" said Ben, puzzled. \"What did you think?\" \"I thought there was a Cousin Jennie.\" Our hero laughed, and, it may be, blushed a little. \"What made you think that?\" \"There generally is, I notice,\" said Mr. Bradley, eagerly. \"Is Cousin Jennie pretty?\" \"To be sure she is.\" \"I thought that too, Ben.\" \"What are you driving at, Jake?\" \"I was sure there was some one besides the old folks that you was anxious about.\" \"Well, you happen to be right,\" said Ben, laughing. \"But I must tell you that Jennie is only fourteen, and I am only sixteen.\" \"You\u0027ll both of you be older some day, Ben. But there\u0027s a matter that we must settle before we go.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"About the gold we have found since we\u0027ve been here. We must have some arrangement about dividin\u0027 it.\" [Pg 102]\"We sha\u0027n\u0027t quarrel about that, Jake.\" \"No, there\u0027s no danger of that. That\u0027ll be easy enough. We\u0027ll divide it into two piles, one for you, and the other for me.\" \"Jake, I have no right to half of it. You ought to have two-thirds.\" \"I\u0027d like to argy that matter, Ben. Why should I have two-thirds?\" \"Because you earned it. You understood mining better than I.\" \"We\u0027re equal partners, Ben. I stick to that, and I mean to have my way. I\u0027ve been making a little calculation, and I reckon there\u0027s nigh on to a thousand dollars for the two of us.\" \"As much as that, Jake?\" said Ben, eagerly. \"I reckon there is, though I can\u0027t justly tell.\" \"It doesn\u0027t seem possible I can be worth five hundred dollars,\" said Ben, thoughtfully. \"We\u0027ve only been here four weeks. That makes a hundred and twenty-five dollars a week.\" \"So it does. That\u0027s pretty high pay for a boy.\" \"Before I left home,\" said Ben, \"there was an[Pg 103] old farmer, Deacon Pitkins, who wanted to hire me for a year. What do you think he offered me?\" \"How much?\" \"Twenty dollars a year and board,\" answered Ben. \"I reckon you did better to come to Californy.\" \"It looks so now. How the old deacon would stare if he knew how I had been prospering at the mines! I wish there was any way of sending part of this money home. I would like to make a present to Uncle Job.\" \"When you get to \u0027Frisco you won\u0027t have any trouble about sendin\u0027 it.\" \"Uncle Job thought it was very risky for a boy like me to leave home and seek my fortune in California. I would like to prove to him that I didn\u0027t make a mistake.\" \"It\u0027s likely you haven\u0027t, Ben,\" said Bradley cautiously, \"but you ain\u0027t out of the woods yet. I hope things will go on as well as they have, and you\u0027ll be able to carry a pile home. But we\u0027ve got to start in good season to-morrow, and we may as well turn in and go to sleep.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81228.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
