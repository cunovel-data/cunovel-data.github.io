{"id":30410,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. A SECRET CONFERENCE.","content":"The affairs of Florence Douglas are so interwoven with the fortunes of my young hero that I find myself obliged to devote a part of my space to their record. I confess that I have no pleasure in detailing the schemes of Orton Campbell, who seems to me a very disagreeable character, but it seems necessary. After leaving the presence of Miss Douglas he took a walk, to consider the situation and decide what it was most expedient to do. He was spending considerable time and money in the effort to recover his father\u0027s ward, and he did not like to fail. Yet it was not easy to decide upon any plan which would bring success. It was not a matter in which he could invoke the assistance of the law. The young lady\u0027s manner convinced him that she[Pg 184] would not of her own free will consent to accompany him back. What, then, was to be done? On the principle that two heads are better than one, he resolved to take his companion, Jones, into his confidence and ask him to make a suggestion. \"How did you find the young lady, Mr. Orton?\" asked his follower on his return to the hotel. \"Very offish, Jones.\" \"Then she wasn\u0027t glad to see you?\" said Jones, with a grin. \"By no means. She hardly treated me with civility.\" \"That\u0027s because of the other man,\" said Jones, sagaciously. \"You are right. Mr. Dewey, as I learned, is in California.\" \"Then maybe they have an understanding together.\" \"No; she doesn\u0027t know where he is.\" Jones was puzzled, and showed it in a way common to men of his class. He scratched his head and looked perplexed. [Pg 185]\"Then, what good is it for her to stay here?\" he asked, after a pause. \"She is taking steps to find this Dewey, who is somewhere at the mines, though she would not tell me what they were. He may turn up any time, and then good-bye to all my hopes.\" \"You want to marry her yourself, Mr. Orton?\" \"Of course. Otherwise I wouldn\u0027t have come so far in search of her.\" \"The young lady is very rich, isn\u0027t she?\" asked Jones, shrewdly. \"She has a moderate fortune,\" replied Orton, guardedly; \"but that doesn\u0027t influence me.\" \"Of course not,\" said Jones; but there was something in his tone which made Campbell eye him sharply. \"I am no fortune-hunter,\" said he, stiffly. \"You\u0027d want to marry her just the same if she hadn\u0027t a cent?\" \"Of course I would,\" snapped Orton. \"Now, that\u0027s what I call real love,\" said Jones. \"To be sure, you\u0027re rich yourself, and needn\u0027t mind.\" [Pg 186]\"Precisely so. I may not be rich, but I can support a wife.\" \"As the young lady prefers some one else, I suppose we may as well go home?\" \"That\u0027s what I want to talk to you about, Jones. Very likely this Dewey is dead; at any rate, he\u0027s a mere fortune-hunter. Now, although Florence doesn\u0027t care to marry me now, if our marriage could be brought about she would no doubt be reconciled to it after a while. Now, Jones, have you anything to suggest?\" Orton Campbell threw himself back in his chair and eyed Jones. He had formed a plan, but, if possible, he wanted the proposal to come from Jones. Jones was not over-scrupulous; he had never been so, and the months he had spent in the mines in the company of adventurers of all kinds had not improved him. Even law-abiding citizens often lost their regard for law in California, and Jones had fewer scruples to overcome than most. He suggested a plan which met with the ap[Pg 187]proval of his employer, and promised his co-operation on the understanding that if successful Campbell should properly reward him. It may be added that of the thousand dollars which he was to receive for his information he had actually received but three hundred, Orton Campbell having on various pretexts put off paying him. He received the assurance that this also should be paid him without further delay as soon as the plan referred to was successfully carried out.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81239.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
