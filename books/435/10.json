{"id":30396,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX. BRADLEY\u0027S SIGNAL VICTORY.","content":"Bill Mosely started back as if he had seen a rattlesnake, and stared at Jake Bradley in mingled surprise and dismay. \"You didn\u0027t expect to see me, I reckon?\" said Bradley, dryly. Mosely still stared at him, uncertain what to say or what to do. \"I take it very kind of you to bring back the hosses you borrowed a few weeks since. You took \u0027em rather sudden, without askin\u0027 leave; it was a kind of oversight on your part.\" \"I don\u0027t know what you mean,\" answered Mosely, determined to brazen it out and keep the horses if possible, for he was lazy and a pedestrian tramp would not have suited him very well. \"You know what I mean well enough, Bill Mosely. If you don\u0027t, them mustangs outside may re[Pg 79]fresh your recollection. They look kinder fagged out. You\u0027ve worked \u0027em too hard, Mosely.\" \"Those mustangs are ours. We bought \u0027em,\" said Mosely, boldly.—\"Didn\u0027t we, Tom?\" \"I should say so,\" remarked Hadley, with striking originality. \"That\u0027s a lie, Tom,\" remarked Bradley, calmly, \"and you know it as well as I do.\" \"Are we goin\u0027 to stand that, Tom?\" blustered Mosely, whose courage was beginning to revive, as he had thus far only seen Bradley, and considered that the odds were two to one in his favor. Of course the Chinaman counted for nothing. Tom Hadley looked a little doubtful, for he could see that the enemy, though apparently single-handed, was a man of powerful frame and apparently fearless even to recklessness. He had a strong suspicion that Bill Mosely was a coward and would afford him very little assistance in the event of a scrimmage. \"If you can\u0027t stand it,\" said Bradley, \"sit down, if you want to.\" Thus far, Richard Dewey had remained silent,[Pg 80] but he wished to participate in the defence of their property if there should be need, and of course must be released first. \"Jake,\" said he, \"these fellows have tied me hand and foot. They couldn\u0027t have done it if I had not been partially disabled. Send in Ki Sing to cut the cords.\" \"They dared to tie you?\" said Bradley, sternly.—\"Mosely, what was that for?\" \"To remove one obstacle in the way of plunder,\" Dewey answered for them. \"They\u0027re not only hoss-thieves, but thieves through and through. Since they tied you, they must untie you.—Mosely, go and cut the cords.\" \"I am not a slave to be ordered round,\" returned Mosely, haughtily. \"What are you, then?\" \"A gentleman.\" \"Then you\u0027ll be a dead gentleman in less than a minute if you don\u0027t do as I tell you.\" As he spoke he drew out his revolver and levelled it at Mosely. The latter turned pale. \"Don\u0027t handle that[Pg 81] we\u0027pon so careless, stranger,\" he said. \"It might go off.\" \"So it might—as like as not,\" answered Bradley, calmly. \"Put it up,\" said Mosely, nervously.—\"Tom, just cut them cords.\" \"Tom, you needn\u0027t do it.—Mosely, you\u0027re the man for that duty. Do you hear?\" Bill Mosely hesitated. He didn\u0027t like to yield and be humiliated before the man over whom he had retained so long an ascendency. \"You\u0027d better be quick about it,\" said Bradley, warningly. \"This here we\u0027pon goes off terrible easily. I don\u0027t want to shoot you, but there might be an accident. I\u0027ve killed twenty-one men with it already. You\u0027ll be the twenty-second.\" That was hint enough. Pride gave way, and Bill Mosely knelt down and cut the cords which confined Dewey, and the invalid, with a sense of relief, sat up on his pallet and watched the conference. \"There! are you satisfied?\" asked Mosely, sullenly. [Pg 82]\"It\u0027ll do as far as it goes, Mosely,\" said Bradley. \"I wouldn\u0027t advise you to try any more of them tricks.\" He lowered his weapon, and was about to replace it, when Mosely, who had made a secret sign to his companion, sprang forward simultaneously with Tom Hadley and seized the intrepid Bradley. The attack was sudden, and also unexpected, for Bradley had such a contempt for the prowess of William Mosely that he had not supposed him capable of planning or carrying out so bold an attack. It must be admitted that he was taken at disadvantage, and might have been temporarily overpowered, for Tom Hadley was strong, and Mosely, though a coward, was nerved by desperation. Richard Dewey saw his friend\u0027s danger, but, unhappily, he had no weapon at hand. But help was not long in coming. Concealed by the walls of the cabin, Ben had heard all that had been said, and observed the attack upon his comrade. He did not hesitate a moment, but sprang forward and showed himself at Bradley\u0027s side. [Pg 83]\"Let him go, or I\u0027ll shoot,\" he exclaimed in a tone of command, pointing at Mosely the twin brother of the revolver which Bradley owned. \"Confusion!\" ejaculated Mosely, in fresh dismay. \"Let go,\" repeated Ben, firmly. Bill Mosely released Bradley, and the latter threw off the grasp of Tom Hadley. \"Now,\" said he, as standing side by side with Ben he confronted the two thieves, \"shall we shoot?\" \"No, no,\" said Mosely, nervously. \"Serve you right if we did. So you thought you\u0027d got me, did you? You didn\u0027t know about Ben, there. He ain\u0027t half your size, but he\u0027s got twice the courage.—Ben, what shall we do with them?\" Bill Mosely turned toward Ben, anxious to hear what our hero would say. He was entirely in the power of the two friends, as he realized. \"Serve them as they served Ki Sing,\" suggested Ben. \"That\u0027s a good idea, that is!—Here, you two rascals, trot out here.\" [Pg 84]Following directions, the two men emerged from the cabin and stood on one side of the doorway, feeling that they would gladly be in some other part of California at that precise moment. \"Mosely, do you see that tree?\" \"Yes.\" \"Go to it.\" Bill Mosely slowly and unwillingly proceeded to do as he was told. \"Ki Sing,\" said Jake Bradley to the Chinaman, who was standing near at hand, his face wearing a bland and contented smile, \"have you any cord in your pocket?\" \"Yes,\" answered the Celestial. \"Tie that man to the tree.\" Ki Sing approached to follow instructions, when Bill Mosely shouted, \"I\u0027ll brain you, you yaller heathen, if you dare to touch me!\" \"Just as you say, squire,\" said Bradley, nonchalantly raising his revolver; \"if you\u0027d prefer to be shot I\u0027m a very accommodatin\u0027 man, and I\u0027ll oblige you. I guess it\u0027ll be better, as we\u0027ll save all trouble.\" [Pg 85]\"Stop! stop!\" cried Mosely, in dismay. \"He can tie me.\" \"You\u0027ve changed your mind. I thought you would,\" said Bradley.—\"Ki Sing, go ahead.\" With native dexterity, and not without a feeling of satisfaction easily understood under the circumstances, Ki Sing proceeded to tie his former captor, but present captive, to a stout sapling. \"Is it strong?\" asked Bradley. \"Velly stlong,\" answered the Chinaman, with a satisfied look. \"That\u0027s good.—Now, Tom, it\u0027s your turn. There\u0027s your tree! Annex yourself to it.\" Tom Hadley saw the futility of resistance, and quietly allowed himself to be confined in the same manner as his companion. When both were thus disposed of Jake Bradley turned to the Chinaman: \"Now, Ki Sing, let us have some supper as soon as possible. We\u0027ve been doin\u0027 considerable business, Ben and I, and we\u0027re as hungry as bears.—Good-night, Mosely. Hope you\u0027ll have a good night\u0027s rest!\" [Pg 86]\"You are not going to leave us here all night, are you?\" said Bill Mosely, uneasily. \"That\u0027s just what I\u0027m goin\u0027 to do. I\u0027ll let you go in the mornin\u0027 if you behave yourself. Still, if you\u0027d rather be shot I can accommodate you.\" \"What a bloodthirsty brute!\" ejaculated the unhappy Mosely as Bradley disappeared within the doorway. \"I should say so!\" echoed Tom Hadley from the other tree. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81225.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
