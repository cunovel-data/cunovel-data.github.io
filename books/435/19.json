{"id":30405,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. AFTER THE EXECUTION.","content":"While Ben rejoiced and lifted silent thanks to God for his narrow escape from a shameful death, he felt no satisfaction in the knowledge that the men who had basely conspired against them had suffered the like terrible fate. He averted his head in horror from the sight, and, innocent as he was of fault, he felt depressed to think that his words had resulted in bringing this punishment upon them. I have said that he was the hero of the hour. Boys were scarce in California, and the hearts of the miners warmed to him on account of his youth and the memories it called up of their own children far away. A self-appointed committee waited upon him and asked him to stay with them. \"We\u0027ll all help you along,\" they said. \"We will[Pg 148] make your share equal to that of the luckiest miner among us. You\u0027re true grit, and we respect you for it. What do you say?\" \"What shall I do, Jake?\" he asked of Bradley. \"It\u0027s a fair offer, Ben. Perhaps you\u0027d best stay. I\u0027d stay too, only I want to see Dick Dewey safe in \u0027Frisco. When he and his gal are j\u0027ined I\u0027ll come back and try my luck here.\" \"I will do the same, Jake. I want to go to San Francisco and see the lady who was so kind to me. I sha\u0027n\u0027t feel that I\u0027ve done all my duty till I have seen her and Mr. Dewey united. Then I shall be ready to come back.\" \"Tell \u0027em so, Ben.\" Ben gave this answer to those who had asked him to stay, thanking them gratefully for their kind offer. His answer gave general satisfaction. Ben could hardly realize that these very men had been impatient to hang him only an hour before. He was thankful for this change in their sentiments, though he did not pretend to understand it. Bradley and Dewey, knowing the fickleness of a mining-community, were a little apprehensive that[Pg 149] their original suspicions might again be aroused, and that some among them might be led to think they had make a mistake, after all, and hung the wrong men. That would be serious, and perhaps dangerous to them. They reflected that only Ben\u0027s speech had turned the tide of sentiment, and the two thieves had been hung on the unsupported word of a boy. Might not this occur to some of the company in some of their cooler moments? They decided in a secret conference that it would be best for them to get away early the next morning—that is, as early as practicable—before any change had come over the minds of their new friends. Later, however, they were relieved from their momentary apprehension. Two men who had been out hunting did not return to the camp till an hour after the execution had taken place. \"What\u0027s happened? they asked. \"We\u0027ve only been hangin\u0027 a couple of hoss-thieves,\" was answered coolly by one of their comrades. \"We came near hangin\u0027 the wrong men, but we found out our mistake.\" [Pg 150]The two hunters went to view the bodies of the malefactors, who were still suspended from the extemporized gallows. \"I know them men,\" said one with sudden recognition. \"What do you know about them? Did you ever meet them?\" \"I reckon I did. They camped with me one night, and in the morning they were missing, and all my gold-dust too.\" \"Then it\u0027s true what the boy said? they\u0027re thieves, and no mistake?\" \"You\u0027ve made no mistake this time. You\u0027ve hung the right men.\" This fresh testimony was at once communicated to the miners, and received with satisfaction, as one or two had been a little in doubt as to whether the two men were really guilty. No one heard it with more pleasure than Dewey and Bradley, who felt now that they were completely exonerated. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81234.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
