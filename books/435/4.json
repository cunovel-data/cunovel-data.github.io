{"id":30390,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III. TWO GENTLEMEN OF THE ROAD.","content":"Perhaps two hours earlier two horsemen might have been seen riding slowly over a lower slope of the mountain. The horses they bestrode were of the Mexican breed, or, in common parlance, mustangs. They were themselves dressed in Mexican style, and bore a strong resemblance to bandits as we are apt to picture them. These gentlemen were Bill Mosely and Tom Hadley, hailing originally from Missouri, but not reflecting any particular credit on their native State. They were in fact adventurers, having a strong objection to honest work and a decided preference for gaining a living by unlawful means. The very horses they bestrode were stolen, having once belonged to Jake Bradley and Ben Stanton. The circumstances under which they were stolen will be remembered by readers of The Young Explorer. [Pg 31]\"Beastly place, this, Tom!\" said Bill Mosely, with a strong expression of disgust. \"I should say so,\" answered Hadley, who was wont by this phrase to echo the sentiments expressed by his companion and leader. \"I wouldn\u0027t have come up here if it had proved safe to stay lower down,\" continued Bill Mosely. \"That last man we relieved of his gold-dust might prove troublesome if we should fall in with him again—eh, Tom?\" \"I should say so,\" remarked Mr. Hadley in a tone of sincere conviction. \"I should like to see him when he wakes up and finds his bag of dust missing,\" said Mosely, with a laugh. As he spoke he drew from his pocket a good-sized bag which appeared to be nearly full of dust. \"There must be several hundred dollars\u0027 worth there,\" he said, complacently. He expected to hear Hadley answer in his usual style, but was disappointed. \"When are we going to divide?\" asked Hadley, with an expression of interest not unmingled with anxiety. [Pg 32]\"You\u0027d better let me carry it, Tom; it\u0027s all the same.\" \"I should say so. No, I would prefer to take charge of my part,\" said Hadley, \"or at least to carry the bag part of the time.\" Bill Mosely frowned darkly, and he brought his hand near the pocket in which he carried his pistol. \"Hadley,\" he said, sternly, \"do you doubt my honor?\" \"I should say—not,\" answered Tom Hadley in a dissatisfied tone, bringing out the last word after a slight pause; \"but I don\u0027t see why I shouldn\u0027t carry the bag part of the time.\" \"Had you doubted my honor,\" continued Mosely with a grand air, \"though you are my friend, I should have been compelled to take your life. I never take any back talk. I chaw up any one who insults me. I\u0027m a regular out-and-out desperado, I am, when I\u0027m riled.\" \"I\u0027ve heard all that before,\" said Tom Hadley, rather impatiently. It was quite true, for this was the style in which Bill Mosely was accustomed to address new acquaint[Pg 33]ances. It had not succeeded with Jake Bradley, who had enough knowledge of human nature to detect the falsity of Mosely\u0027s pretensions and the sham character of his valor. \"You\u0027ve heard it before,\" said Mosely, severely, \"but ain\u0027t it true? That\u0027s what I ask you, Tom Hadley.\" \"I should say so,\" slipped out almost unconsciously from the lips of the habitual echo. \"\u0027Tis well,\" said Mosely, waving his hand. \"You know it and you believe it. I\u0027m a bad man to insult, I am. I generally chaw up them that stand in my way.\" Tom Hadley was really a braver man than Mosely, and he answered obstinately, \"Give me half that gold-dust, or I\u0027ll take it.\" Bill Mosely saw his determined face and felt that it was necessary to back down. \"I don\u0027t know why I don\u0027t shoot you,\" he said, trying to keep up his air of domination. \"Because two can play at that game,\" said Hadley, doggedly. He produced a pouch, and Bill Mosely, much[Pg 34] against his will, was compelled to divide the contents of the stolen bag, managing, however, to retain the larger share himself. \"I don\u0027t want to quarrel with a friend,\" said Bill, more mildly, \"but you don\u0027t act friendly to-day.\" \"It\u0027s all right now,\" said Hadley, satisfied. \"Maybe you think I don\u0027t want to act fair,\" continued Mosely in an injured tone. \"Why, the very horse you are riding is a proof to the contrary. I didn\u0027t ask for both horses, did I?\" \"You couldn\u0027t ride both,\" answered Tom Hadley, with practical good sense. \"I wonder where the fellows are we took them from?\" said Mosely, with a change of subject. \"The man was a regular fire-eater: I wouldn\u0027t like to meet him again.\" \"I should say so,\" chimed in Hadley, emphatically. Bradley had paid Mosely in his own coin, and boasted of his prowess even more extravagantly than that braggadocio, claiming to have killed from seventy to eighty men in the course of his[Pg 35] experience. Mosely had been taken in by his confident tone, and knowing that he was himself a sham desperado, though a genuine thief and highwayman, had been made to feel uneasy while in Bradley\u0027s company. \"I wonder what became of them?\" continued Mosely, thoughtfully. As Tom Hadley\u0027s special phrase could not come in here appropriately, he forbore to make any remark. \"He thought he would scare me by his fierce talk,\" said Mosely, who would hardly have spoken so confidently had he known that Bradley was only two miles distant from him at that identical moment. \"It takes a good deal to scare a man like me—eh, Tom?\" \"I should say so,\" returned Hadley, but it was noticeable that he spoke rather dubiously, and not with his usual positiveness. \"I\u0027m a hard man to handle,\" continued Mosely, complacently, relapsing into the style of talk which he most enjoyed. \"I\u0027m as bad as they make \u0027em.\" [Pg 36]\"I should say so,\" chimed in Tom Hadley; and there was nothing doubtful in his tone now. Bill Mosely looked at him as if he suspected there was something suspicious under this speech, but Tom Hadley wore his usual look, and his companion dismissed his momentary doubt. \"You never saw me afraid of any living man—eh, Tom?\" \"I should say so,\" answered Hadley. There was something equivocal in this speech, and Bill Mosely looked vexed. \"Can\u0027t you say anything but that?\" he grumbled. \"It looks as if you doubted my statement. No man doubt my word—and lives.\" Tom Hadley merely shrugged his shoulders. He was not a man of brilliant intellectual ability or of rare penetration, but there were times when even he was led to suspect that his companion was a humbug. Yet Mosely had greater force of character, and took uncommon pains to retain his ascendency over his more simple-minded companion, and had in the main been successful, though in the matter of the gold-dust he had been obliged to score a defeat. [Pg 37]As Hadley did not see fit to express any doubt of this last statement, Bill Mosely was content to let the matter drop, assuming that he had gained a victory and recovered his ascendency over his echo. They had met no one for some hours, and did not look for an encounter with anything wearing the semblance of humanity, when all at once Tom Hadley uttered an exclamation. \"What is it, Tom?\" asked Mosely. \"Look there!\" was the only answer, as Hadley, with outstretched finger, pointed to a Chinaman walking slowly up the hill. \"It\u0027s a heathen Chinee!\" exclaimed Mosely with animation. \"I should say so,\" echoed Hadley. Mosely urged his mustang to greater speed, and soon overtook Ki Sing, for it was Richard Dewey\u0027s attendant whom the two adventurers had fallen in with.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81219.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
