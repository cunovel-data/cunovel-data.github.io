{"id":30389,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II. THE MISSING CHINAMAN.","content":"If Florence Douglas was an heiress, our young hero, Ben Stanton, was likewise possessed of property, though his inheritance was not a very large one. When his father\u0027s estate was settled it was found that it amounted to three hundred and sixty-five dollars. Though rather a large sum in Ben\u0027s eyes, he was quite aware that the interest of this amount would not support him. Accordingly, being ambitious, he drew from his uncle, Job Stanton, a worthy shoemaker, the sum of seventy-five dollars, and went to New York, hoping to obtain employment. In this he was disappointed, but he had the good fortune to meet Miss Florence Douglas, by whom he was invited to accompany her to California as her escort, his expenses of course being paid by his patroness. It is needless to say that Ben accepted this[Pg 24] proposal with alacrity, and, embarking on a steamer, landed in less than a month at San Francisco. He did not remain here long, but started for the mining-districts, still employed by Miss Douglas, in search of Richard Dewey, her affianced husband, whom her guardian had forbidden her to marry. As we have already said, Ben and his chosen companion, Jake Bradley, succeeded in their mission, but as yet had been unable to communicate tidings of their success to Miss Douglas, there being no chance to send a letter to San Francisco from the lonely hut where they were at present living. Besides carrying out the wishes of his patroness, Ben intended to try his hand at mining, and had employed the interval of three weeks since he discovered Mr. Dewey in working the latter\u0027s claim, with the success already referred to. The time when the two friends are introduced to the reader is at the close of the day, when, fatigued by their work on the claim, they are glad to rest and chat. Mr. Bradley has a pipe in his mouth, and evidently takes considerable comfort in his evening smoke. [Pg 25]\"I wish I had a pipe for you, Ben,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t know how it rests me to smoke.\" \"I\u0027ll take your word for it, Jake,\" returned Ben, smiling. \"Won\u0027t you take a whiff? You don\u0027t know how soothin\u0027 it is.\" \"I don\u0027t need to be soothed, Jake. I\u0027m glad you enjoy it, but I don\u0027t envy you a particle.\" \"Well, p\u0027r\u0027aps you\u0027re right, Ben. Our old doctor used to say smokin\u0027 wasn\u0027t good for boys, but I\u0027ve smoked more or less since I was twelve years old.\" \"There\u0027s something I\u0027d like better than smoking just now,\" said Ben. \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Eating supper.\" \"Just so. I wonder where that heathen Ki Sing is?\" Ki Sing was cook and general servant to the little party, and performed his duties in a very satisfactory manner—better than either Ben or Bradley could have done—and left his white employers freer to work at the more congenial occupation of searching for gold. [Pg 26]\"Ki Sing is unusually late,\" said Richard Dewey. \"I wonder what can have detained him? I am beginning to feel hungry myself.\" \"The heathen is usually on time,\" said Bradley, \"though he hasn\u0027t got a watch, any more than I have.—Dick, what time is it?\" \"Half-past six,\" answered Richard Dewey, who, though a miner, had not been willing to dispense with all the appliances of civilization. \"Maybe Ki Sing has found another place,\" suggested Ben, jocosely. \"He is faithful; I will vouch for that,\" said Dewey. \"I am more afraid that he has met with some accident—like mine, for instance.\" \"You won\u0027t catch a Chinaman spraining his ankle,\" said Bradley; \"they\u0027re too spry for that. They\u0027ll squeeze through where a white man can\u0027t, and I wouldn\u0027t wonder if they could turn themselves inside out if they tried hard.\" \"It is possible,\" suggested Dewey, \"that Ki Sing may have met with some of our own race who have treated him roughly. You know the strong prejudice that is felt against the poor fellows by some[Pg 27] who are far less deserving than they. They think it good sport to torment a Chinaman.\" \"I can\u0027t say I like \u0027em much myself,\" said Bradley; \"but I don\u0027t mind saying that Ki Sing is a gentleman. He is the best heathen I know of, and if I should come across any fellow harmin\u0027 him I reckon I\u0027d be ready to take a hand myself.\" \"We couldn\u0027t get along very well without him, Jake,\" said Ben. \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re right, Ben. He\u0027s made himself useful to us, and no mistake.\" \"I have reason to feel indebted to him,\" said Dewey. \"Injured as I was, I should have fared badly but for his faithful services. I am not at all sure that I should have been living at this moment had not the grateful fellow cared for me and supplied my wants.\" It may be explained here that Richard Dewey had at one time rescued Ki Sing from some rough companions who had made up their minds to cut off the Chinaman\u0027s queue, thereby, in accordance with Chinese custom, preventing him ever returning to his native country. It was the thought of this ser[Pg 28]vice that had prompted Ki Sing to faithful service when he found his benefactor in need of it. Half an hour passed, and still the Chinaman did not appear. All three became anxious, especially Dewey. \"Bradley,\" said he, \"would you mind going out to look for Ki Sing? I\u0027m sure something has happened to him.\" \"Just what I was thinkin\u0027 of myself,\" said Bradley. \"I\u0027ll go, and I\u0027ll bring him back if he\u0027s above ground.\" \"I\u0027ll go with you, Jake,\" said Ben, rising from the ground on which he was seated. \"You\u0027d better stay with Dick Dewey,\" said Bradley; \"maybe he\u0027ll want you.\" \"I forgot that. Yes, I will stay.\" \"No; I would rather you would go with Bradley,\" said the invalid. \"Two will stand a better chance of success than one. I sha\u0027n\u0027t need anything while you are away.\" \"Just as you say, Dick.—Well, Ben, let\u0027s start along. I reckon we\u0027ll find Ki Sing before long, and then we\u0027ll have some supper.\" [Pg 29]As the two started on their errand Richard Dewey breathed a sigh of relief. \"I really believe I\u0027m getting attached to Ki Sing,\" he said to himself. \"He\u0027s a good fellow, if he is a Chinaman, and if ever I am prosperous I will take him into my service and see that he is comfortably provided for.\" The poor Chinaman, though Dewey did not suspect it, was at that moment in a very uncomfortable position indeed, and he himself was menaced by a peril already near at hand against which his helpless condition allowed of no defence. His lonely and monotonous life was destined to be varied that evening in an unpleasant manner. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81218.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
