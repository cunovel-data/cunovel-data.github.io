{"id":30397,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X. \"THE BEST OF FRIENDS MUST PART.\"","content":"Mosely and his companion continued in captivity through the night. Some of my readers may consider the punishment a severe one, and it must be admitted that it was attended with no small share of discomfort. But for that time it was an exceedingly mild penalty for the offence which the two men had committed. In the early days of California, theft was generally punished in the most summary manner by hanging the culprit from a limb of the nearest tree, and that, in the majority of cases, would have been the fate of Bill Mosely and Tom Hadley. But neither Bradley nor Ben was willing to go to such extremes. Jake Bradley had had rough experiences, and he was no soft-hearted sentimentalist, but he had a natural repugnance to taking the life of his fellow-creatures. [Pg 88]\"Money,\" he said on one occasion to Ben, \"ain\u0027t to be measured ag\u0027in a man\u0027s life. I don\u0027t say I wouldn\u0027t kill a man for some things, though I should hate to mightily, but it wouldn\u0027t be on account of robbery. I wouldn\u0027t have a man\u0027s blood on my conscience for such a thing as that.\" It is needless to say that our young hero, whose heart was warm and humane, agreed fully with his older companion. When the two friends got up in the morning and went out of the cabin, they found their two captives in the same position in which they had left them. They looked weary and were stiff in the limbs, as well they might be. \"Well, my friends,\" said Bradley, \"I hope you\u0027ve passed a pleasant night.\" \"I\u0027m almost dead,\" growled Bill Mosely. \"I feel as if I\u0027d been here a week.\" \"Do you feel the same way?\" inquired Bradley, addressing Tom Hadley. \"I should say so,\" answered Hadley, in a voice of intense disgust. \"It was your own choice, Mosely,\" said Jake[Pg 89] Bradley. \"It was either all night braced up against a tree, or to be shot at once and put out of your misery.\" \"Who wants to be shot?\" returned Mosely. \"That would be worse than stayin\u0027 here all night. You might have let us go last night.\" \"So I might, but I wanted to teach you a lesson. You know very well, Bill Mosely, you\u0027d have fared a good deal worse with some men. You\u0027d have been swingin\u0027 from the nearest bough, and so would your friend. You\u0027ll come to that some time, but I\u0027d rather some one else would hang you. It ain\u0027t a job I hanker after.\" \"Are you goin\u0027 to set us free?\" asked Mosely, impatiently, not enjoying Bradley\u0027s prediction as to his future fate. \"Yes, I think I will—on one condition.\" \"Go ahead! I\u0027ll agree to anything.\" \"That you\u0027ll leave this part of California and not come back. I don\u0027t want you to cross my path ag\u0027in.\" \"You can bet I don\u0027t mean to,\" said Mosely; and there is no doubt he was entirely in earnest. [Pg 90]\"Do you make the same promise, Tom?\" asked Bradley, turning to Hadley. \"I should say so,\" returned Hadley; and there is no reason to doubt his sincerity also. \"You see, my friends, you don\u0027t appear to know the difference between your property and mine, particularly when it comes to hosses. It is an unfortunate little peculiarity of yours that will bring your life to an untimely end some of these days. If you should ever reform and set up as respectable men, I might be willin\u0027 to know you, but there\u0027s about as much chance of that, accordin\u0027 to my reckonin\u0027, as of water runnin\u0027 up hill.\" While he was expressing himself thus he was cutting the cords of his prisoners, and they took the first chance to stretch their cramped limbs. \"Feel better, don\u0027t you?\" asked Bradley, smiling. \"I should say so,\" answered Hadley. \"Couldn\u0027t you give us something to eat?\" asked Mosely; \"I haven\u0027t eaten a mouthful since yesterday noon, and I feel faint.\" \"Ki Sing,\" said Bradley, \"bring out some victuals. These men are not particular friends of[Pg 91] mine, but we won\u0027t send them away hungry. I\u0027ve known what it is to fast for thirty-six hours at a stretch, and I understand how it feels.\" Ki Sing brought out some cold meat and other plain food, which the two adventurers ate as if they were famished. Their long fast and exposure during the night had sharpened their appetites and lent a keener zest to their enjoyment of the meal. When they had finished Jake Bradley pointed down the mountain. \"You\u0027ve had your breakfast,\" he said, \"and now there is only one thing more. I want to see you travel.\" Bill Mosely looked askance at the two mustangs, which were tied only a few rods off. Jake Bradley caught the direction of his glance. \"It\u0027s no go, my friend,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t borrow our mustangs this time. We shall have occasion to use them ourselves. It won\u0027t do you any harm to try your own legs for a while.\" Bill Mosely wasn\u0027t easily abashed. He was lazy, and the prospect of tramping all day was by no means agreeable to him. Thanks to his last robbery, he and his companion were tolerably well[Pg 92] supplied with gold-dust, which was a common circulating medium in California at that time. An idea struck him, which he lost no time in carrying out. \"What value do you set on them horses?\" he asked. \"What makes you ask?\" inquired Jake Bradley, with some curiosity. \"We\u0027ll buy \u0027em if you\u0027ll take a fair price.\" \"Buy our mustangs! Have you got the money?\" \"We\u0027ve got gold-dust.\" \"Where did you get it? I\u0027ll warrant you didn\u0027t work for it.\" \"That\u0027s our business,\" answered Mosely, stiffly. \"The question is, Do you want to sell?\" \"No, I don\u0027t; and if I did I should want to know whose money I was takin\u0027.\" Bill Mosely was disappointed. In that lonely neighborhood it was hardly likely there would be any other opportunity of obtaining horses, and there was nothing for it but to walk. \"You haven\u0027t got any other business, have you, Mosely?\" asked Bradley. \"No.—Tom, come on.\" \"Good-bye, then. Our acquaintance has been brief,[Pg 93] Mosely, but I know you as well as if we\u0027d lived in the same town for years. You\u0027re a fine man, you are, and an ornament to your native State; but if you ain\u0027t a little more careful you\u0027ll be likely to die young, and the world will lose a man who in his line can\u0027t be beat.\" Bill Mosely did not attempt any reply to this farewell, but strode down the sloping path, closely followed by Tom Hadley. When he had got out of hearing of his late captors he turned to Hadley and said, \"I hate that man! He has put a stain on my honor; he has insulted and outraged me.\" \"I should say so,\" observed Tom Hadley. \"He has treated you just as badly, Hadley; that stain must be washed out in blood.\" \"When?\" inquired his companion, in a matter-of-fact manner. \"I don\u0027t know. Some time. He has had the advantage over us this time, but we shall meet again. Do you hear that, Tom Hadley?\" continued Mosely, in a theatrical tone, raising his voice at the same time—\"we shall meet again.\" [Pg 94]\"I don\u0027t want to meet him again,\" said Hadley. \"You don\u0027t comprehend me. When we meet it will be our turn to deal with him.\" \"Just as you say,\" returned Tom Hadley, varying his usual formula. \"It\u0027s very unlucky we went up to that cabin,\" said Bill, after a pause. \"I should say so,\" chimed in Tom, very emphatically. \"It was cursed ill-luck, but how could we know that that dare-devil was a friend of Dewey\u0027s? If we\u0027d let well enough alone, we shouldn\u0027t have lost our horses and been compelled to tramp on foot over these mountains.\" \"Where are we going?\" asked Tom Hadley. \"Down hill,\" answered Mosely briefly. This answer did not appear to Tom Hadley to contain much information, but his mind was not active enough to frame another question, and the two plodded along in silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81226.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
