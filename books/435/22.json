{"id":30408,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. MR. CAMPBELL RECEIVES TIDINGS OF HIS WARD.","content":"\"It is strange we can\u0027t find Florence,\" said Orton Campbell to his father one morning some months after the young lady\u0027s departure. \"Is there no clue?\" \"The detective I have employed has failed to trace her.\" \"Has he no theory?\" \"He suggests that she may have gone to Europe,\" said Mr. Campbell, \"but I am not of that opinion.\" \"What do you think, then?\" \"I suspect she has buried herself in some obscure country place under some assumed name, there to remain till she has attained her twenty-fifth year, when my guardianship ceases.\" \"When will that be?\" \"Six months hence.\" [Pg 166]\"It is very important, then, that we should find her before that time,\" said Orton Campbell, thoughtfully. \"That is true. After the time referred to my power ceases, and I shall be unable to assist you in your plans.\" \"Her fortune amounts to one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, does it not?\" \"More than that. The interest has been accumulating till it amounts to nearer one hundred and seventy thousand dollars.\" Orton Campbell\u0027s eyes sparkled with covetous greed. \"That is a stake worth playing for,\" he said. \"With what I have of my own, it would make me independently rich.\" \"Just so, Orton,\" said his father. \"And nothing stands in the way but the caprice of a foolish girl! I declare, father, it is too exasperating. Suppose we try another detective? Your man can\u0027t be very sharp.\" \"I have no objection, Orton,\" said the merchant, \"but as he would be employed in your interest, it[Pg 167] is only fair that you should pay the expense incurred.\" \"I don\u0027t see that,\" said the son. \"She is your ward, you know. It ought to come out of her property.\" \"The item may not be allowed. In that case I should be responsible,\" said John Campbell, cautiously. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I will do, father: if she is found and I marry her, I\u0027ll freely pay the whole expense.\" \"Suppose we find her, and she won\u0027t marry you: what then?\" asked his father, keenly. The son looked nonplussed, but finally consented in that case to defray the expense out of his private means—that is, if it could not be taken out of the young lady\u0027s fortune. The matter having been satisfactorily adjusted, they were discussing the choice of a detective when a clerk came to the door of the private counting-room in which father and son were seated and said, \"There\u0027s a man outside wants to speak to you, Mr. Campbell.\" [Pg 168]\"Who is he, Saunders?\" \"I think it\u0027s Jones, who used to be in your employ as light porter.\" \"How does he look? Well-to-do?\" \"He is decidedly shabby,\" answered Saunders. \"Come to ask help, probably,\" muttered the merchant. \"I think I won\u0027t see him.\" Saunders left the office, but presently returned. \"Well, has he gone?\" asked the merchant. \"No; he says he wants to see you on business of importance.\" \"Of importance to himself, probably.—Shall I see him, Orton?\" \"Yes, father. If he is humbugging us, we can send him off.\" So permission was given, and almost immediately Saunders ushered into the room a short, broad-shouldered fellow, who looked very much like a professional tramp. \"Good-morning, Mr. Campbell,\" said he, deferentially. \"Humph, Jones, is it you? You don\u0027t look as if you had prospered.\" [Pg 169]\"No more I have, sir.\" \"Don\u0027t come near me. Really, your appearance is very disreputable.\" \"I can\u0027t help that, sir. I\u0027ve just come from California in the steerage, and you can\u0027t keep very neat there.\" \"I believe you went to California to make your fortune, didn\u0027t you, Jones?\" said Orton Campbell, with a cynical smile. \"Yes, Mr. Orton, I did.\" \"And you didn\u0027t make it, I infer from your appearance.\" \"I haven\u0027t got much money about me now,\" said Jones, with a shrug and a smile. \"You would have done better not to have left my employment, Jones,\" said the merchant. \"You wanted higher pay, I believe, and as I wouldn\u0027t give it, you decided that you could better yourself at the mines.\" \"That is about so, sir.\" \"Well, and what luck did you have?\" \"Good luck at first, sir. I made a thousand dollars at the mines in a few months.\" [Pg 170]\"Indeed!\" said Orton, in surprise. \"I came with it to San Francisco, and gambled it away in one night. Then I was on my beam-ends, as the sailors say.\" \"Did you go back?\" \"No. I went to work in the city, and managed to get enough money to buy a steerage passage, and here I am.\" \"I suppose you have come to ask me to take you back into my employ? That, I take it, is your business with me.\" \"No, sir—not exactly.\" \"Then, what is it?\" asked the merchant, looking a little puzzled. It crossed his mind that Jones might so far have forgotten his rule never to give away money for any purpose as to suppose there was a chance to effect a loan. \"I thought you and Mr. Orton might be willing to pay my expenses back to San Francisco,\" said Jones, coolly. \"Are you out of your head, Jones?\" demanded Orton Campbell, amazed at the man\u0027s effrontery. \"Not at all.\" [Pg 171]\"If this is meant as a joke, Jones,\" said the merchant in a dignified tone, \"it is a very poor—and, I may add, a very impudent—one. What possible claim have you on us, that you should expect such a favor?\" \"Have you heard anything of your ward, Mr. Campbell?\" asked Jones, not in the least abashed. \"No. What has my ward to do with your concerns?\" \"I have seen her,\" answered Jones, briefly. \"Where?\" asked John Campbell and his son simultaneously. \"That information belongs to me,\" said Jones, quietly. \"A detective doesn\u0027t work without pay.\" The two Campbells now began to see the point. This man had information to sell, and would not give it up without what he considered suitable compensation. They determined to drive the best possible bargain with him. He was poor, and probably could be bought over for a small sum. \"Your information is worth something, Jones,\" said the merchant, guardedly. \"I will go so far as to give you twenty-five dollars cash for it.\" [Pg 172]\"That won\u0027t do,\" said Jones, shaking his head. \"Your information may be worth nothing,\" said Orton. \"You may have seen her, but that doesn\u0027t show where she is now.\" \"I know where she is now,\" said Jones. \"Is she in California?\" \"I don\u0027t mind telling you as much as that, Mr. Orton.\" \"Then we can find her without your assistance.\" \"I don\u0027t think you can. At any rate, it will take time, especially as, if you don\u0027t make a bargain with me, I shall write her that you are on her track.\" Father and son looked at each other. It was evident that Jones was no fool, and they would be obliged to submit to his terms or give up the search, which was not to be thought of. \"What do you propose, Jones?\" asked Mr. Campbell, a little less haughtily. \"That you pay my expenses back to California and one thousand dollars,\" said Jones, promptly. \"If you or Mr. Orton will go with me, I will show you where she lives, and then you can take your own course.\" [Pg 173]This was finally agreed to, and Orton Campbell and the ex-porter sailed by the next steamer for San Francisco, where Florence Douglas, still boarding with Mrs. Armstrong, was waiting impatiently for news of Richard Dewey. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81237.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
