{"id":30416,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. A WEDDING RECEPTION.","content":"Orton Campbell cursed his folly in arousing the hostility of Jones. He concluded that the latter had released Florence in order to obtain a hold upon him, and would be ready to assist him again if satisfactorily paid. In that event all was not lost. It was necessary to see Jones as early as possible and make matters right with him. He was not quite clear as to where Jones could be found, but concluded that he had carried Florence back to her boarding-house. He therefore ordered his driver to proceed at once to the house of Mrs. Armstrong. He hastily descended from the carriage and rang the bell. It was answered by Mrs. Armstrong in person, who regarded him with no very friendly eye. Orton Campbell, knowing his own treachery, and[Pg 230] conscious that it was also known to the lady before him, asked, in some embarrassment, \"Is Miss Douglas here?\" \"No, sir.\" Orton Campbell looked surprised. \"I—I thought she might be here,\" he stammered. \"Were you the person who lured her from my house yesterday by a false letter?\" demanded Mrs. Armstrong, sternly. \"No,\" answered Campbell, unblushingly; \"it was an agent of mine, who has deceived and betrayed me.\" \"Then, you had nothing to do with the disappearance of the young lady?\" \"Certainly not,\" answered Orton Campbell, boldly. \"I assure you it has given me great concern, and I have been riding hither and thither this morning in search of her.\" \"Won\u0027t you come in, sir? Perhaps we may be able to throw some light on this mystery.\" \"She believes me,\" thought Orton Campbell, congratulating himself on the effect of his duplicity.—\"Certainly,\" he answered; \"I shall be most happy to do so.\" [Pg 231]He was ushered into the parlor, into which, five minutes later, entered Florence, Richard Dewey, and a gentleman of clerical appearance. \"Miss Douglas!\" exclaimed Orton Campbell, in astonishment.—\"I thought you said,\" turning to Mrs. Armstrong, \"that Miss Douglas was not here?\" \"I am not Miss Douglas,\" said Florence, quietly. \"I don\u0027t understand you.\" \"Perhaps I can explain the mystery,\" said Richard Dewey, coming forward. \"I wish you would, if you can,\" said Orton Campbell, with a sneer. \"This young lady is my wife.\" \"Your wife? And who are you?\" \"Richard Dewey, at your service.\" Orton Campbell had never known Dewey well, and his life at the mines had so changed his appearance that it was not surprising he did not recognize him. \"Is this true?\" he asked, in visible dismay. \"When were you married?\" \"Half an hour since, by this gentleman;\" and[Pg 232] Richard Dewey waved his hand in the direction of the clerical gentleman already referred to. \"You have done a good stroke of business, sir,\" said Campbell, with a sneer and a look of baffled hatred. \"The lady\u0027s fortune makes her a good match.\" \"So you evidently thought, sir,\" answered Dewey. \"Your unscrupulous methods have not succeeded, and I beg to warn you that the lady now has a protector who will punish any such persecution as that with which you have recently visited her.\" \"You are quite mistaken. My agent—\" \"Only followed your instructions,\" said an unexpected voice, as Jones, who was within hearing, now entered from the adjoining room. \"Mr. Orton, I have confessed all, so you needn\u0027t try to humbug this gentleman.\" \"You are a scoundrel,\" said Campbell, wrathfully, excited by the appearance of the man who, in return for being cheated, had betrayed him. \"Then there\u0027s a pair of us, Mr. Campbell,\" said he, coolly. \"I admit that I behaved like a rascal, but I\u0027ve tried to set matters right.\" [Pg 233]\"You can find your way back to New York as you can; I have done with you,\" said Campbell, hardly conscious that this very remark betrayed him. \"Mr. Dewey has kindly offered to take me back with him,\" said Jones, not at all disturbed by this notice. \"If you are going back by the next steamer, Mr. Campbell,\" said Richard Dewey, \"I will thank you to apprise your father of his ward\u0027s marriage, and ask him to arrange for the surrender of her property at the proper time.\" \"You may attend to your own messages, sir,\" said Orton, irritably. \"I will have nothing to do with them.\" Without any further words he hurried out of the house, and drove at once to the office of the steamship company, where he secured passage by the earliest vessel eastward bound. That same evening Mr. and Mrs. Richard Dewey held an informal reception at their boarding-house. It was not largely attended, for Florence had[Pg 234] made but few acquaintances during her stay in the city. Uncertain as her prospects were, she had thought it best to keep aloof from her friends, who might possibly make known her residence to her guardian. Among those present, however, were Richard Dewey\u0027s tried friends, Bradley and Ben Stanton. Bradley tried to excuse himself, on the ground that he was only a rough miner and not accustomed to society, but his objection was overruled both by Florence and her husband. \"You are a true friend, Mr. Bradley,\" said Florence, gratefully, \"and I should miss you more than any one else except my young friend and cousin, Ben.\" \"Ben\u0027s different from what I am,\" said Bradley. \"He ain\u0027t such a rough specimen.\" \"I\u0027m only a miner, like you,\" said Ben. \"I am a country boy and not used to society, but I don\u0027t believe Cousin Ida will care for that.\" \"Cousin Ida\" was the name by which Ben had been instructed to call Florence when she came out to California under his escort. [Pg 235]The upshot of it all was that both Bradley and Ben were present at the bride\u0027s reception, and were made so thoroughly at home by Mrs. Richard Dewey that neither felt in the least awkward. Two weeks later Richard Dewey and his wife sailed for New York, but Ben and Bradley remained behind. \"Come with us, Ben,\" said Florence. \"I don\u0027t like to leave you behind.\" \"Thank you, Miss Florence—I mean Mrs. Dewey,\" said the boy—\"but I am not ready to go yet.\" \"Don\u0027t let the thought of money keep you here, Ben. I am rich, or I shall be in a few months, when my guardian surrenders his trust, and I will take care that you are well provided for.\" \"Thank you again,\" said Ben; \"but I\u0027ve promised to go back to the mines. I\u0027ve got a claim reserved for me, and so has Bradley. We\u0027ll go back now and try to gather a little more gold-dust.\" \"But you\u0027ll let us see you in New York before long?\" [Pg 236]\"Yes, I shall go home in a few months, even if I come back again later. I want to see Uncle Job and Cousin Jennie, and all my old friends, not forgetting Sam Sturgis,\" added Ben, smiling. \"We must be content with that, I suppose,\" said the young lady. \"I hope you will have good luck, but even if you don\u0027t, remember that you have two friends who will only be too glad to be of service to you.—Please consider, Mr. Bradley, that this is said to you also.\" \"Thank you, ma\u0027am,\" said Jake Bradley, awkwardly, for with all his good traits he was not quite at ease in the society of ladies. Ben and Bradley saw the young couple off on the steamer, and then prepared to go back to the mines. \"It\u0027s made me feel kind of lonesome to part with Dick Dewey,\" said Bradley, thoughtfully. \"He\u0027s a whole-souled feller, and he\u0027s \u0027struck it rich\u0027 in a wife.\" \"That\u0027s so, Jake.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81245.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
