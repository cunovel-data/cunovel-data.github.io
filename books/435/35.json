{"id":30421,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV. CONCLUSION.","content":"\"Do you think we shall have to give up the house, Job?\" asked Mrs. Stanton, anxiously. \"I see no other way,\" said Job, mournfully. \"I can\u0027t raise five hundred dollars anywhere.\" \"Have you been to Deacon Pitkin?\" \"Yes, but the deacon says he\u0027s just put out what money he had, and can\u0027t accommodate me.\" \"It\u0027s hard!\" said Mrs. Stanton, with sad brevity. \"Yes, it is hard!\" assented Job. \"I did hope the Lord would show us a way of deliverance, but it seems likely that the sorrow must come upon us.\" \"How meanly Major Sturgis and that man Richmond have behaved! I can\u0027t help feeling that they will be come up with sooner or later,\" said Mrs.[Pg 266] Stanton, who, mild as she generally was, could not help feeling exasperated. \"I do think they\u0027ve been inconsiderate,\" Job admitted. \"\u0027Inconsiderate\u0027! Their conduct has been contemptible. The major don\u0027t need the money. He could just as well let us stay here.\" While this conversation was going on Ben and his friend Bradley were approaching the little cottage. Full of joyful memories, Ben lifted the latch and walked into the presence of his uncle and aunt. Nothing but his return could have chased the mournful expression from their faces. \"Why, it\u0027s Ben come back!\" exclaimed his aunt, joyfully. \"Well, I declare, so it is!\" answered Job Stanton, hurrying forward and grasping the hand of his boy after his aunt had embraced him. \"How you\u0027ve grown, Ben!\" said his aunt, admiringly. \"Yes, Aunt Clarissa, I\u0027ve grown four inches,\" said Ben, proudly. \"But I\u0027ve brought a friend with me.—Jake, come in.\" [Pg 267]And then Bradley was introduced to Job and his wife, and was cordially welcomed by both. \"You\u0027re lucky to come while we\u0027ve got a home to welcome you to,\" said Job, his face again saddening. \"Why, Uncle Job, you\u0027re not thinking of selling the house, are you?\" Then the whole story came out. Ben listened attentively, and when his uncle had finished he said, \"That Richmond is a first-class rascal.\" \"And I\u0027d like to give him a first-class kick,\" said Bradley, indignantly. \"That wouldn\u0027t mend matters,\" said Job, shaking his head. \"It wouldn\u0027t pay off the mortgage.\" \"You say the mortgage amounts to five hundred dollars, Uncle Job?\" \"Yes. Then there\u0027s six months\u0027 interest, at six per cent., makes fifteen dollars more.\" \"When do you expect Major Sturgis to call?\" \"This morning. It\u0027s almost time for him.\" \"I met Sam on my way here,\" said Ben. \"He[Pg 268] told me I\u0027d come just in the nick of time. I didn\u0027t know what he meant, but I know now.\" \"The major offers to buy the house, paying me two hundred and fifty dollars over and above the note.\" \"Why, that\u0027s robbery!\" said Ben, indignantly. \"So it is, Ben; but what can I do?\" \"I think,\" said Ben, smiling, \"you\u0027d better borrow five hundred and fifteen dollars of your rich nephew.\" \"What do you mean, Ben?\" asked Job, in surprise. \"I mean this, Uncle Job—that I\u0027ll lend you the money to pay up this shark.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say you\u0027ve got money enough?\" ejaculated Uncle Job. \"Yes, I do, uncle, and a little over. I\u0027ll prove it to you.\" He produced a wallet, from which he drew out five one-hundred-dollar bills and three fives. \"Take them, uncle, and ask me questions afterward, for I see through the window that the major is coming.\" [Pg 269]Indeed, a knock was heard directly, and Job, answering it himself, ushered in the stately figure of Major Sturgis. The major looked around him in surprise, finding more persons than he expected to see. \"Don\u0027t you remember Ben, Major Sturgis?\" asked Job. \"When did you come home, Benjamin,\" asked the major, taken by surprise. \"I have just arrived, sir.\" \"Tired of California, eh?\" \"For the present, yes, sir.\" \"I think my son Sam wishes to see you. He thinks of offering you a place.\" Ben bowed and smiled. He understood what sort of a place Sam was likely to offer. \"Well, Mr. Stanton,\" asked the major, pompously, \"have you decided to accept my offer for the house?\" \"No, major. Your offer is too small.\" \"You are quite at liberty to look around for a higher bid, or rather you were. Now it is too late.\" [Pg 270]\"Just so, major. On the whole I don\u0027t think I want to sell.\" \"\u0027Don\u0027t want to sell\u0027?\" repeated the major, frowning; \"you will have to sell.\" \"Why will Uncle Job have to sell?\" demanded Ben, irritated by the major\u0027s tone. \"Young man,\" said the major, grandly, \"this is not a matter with which you have anything to do. Your uncle and I can arrange it between ourselves.\" \"Still, I shall advise Uncle Job to pay the mortgage, though he was swindled into agreeing to it.\" \"I apprehend,\" sneered the major, \"he will have some difficulty in paying me five hundred and fifteen dollars.\" \"I guess I can manage to do it, major,\" said Job, mildly. \"I don\u0027t believe you,\" said the major, hastily. \"Have you got the mortgage with you?\" asked Job. \"Yes; here it is.\" \"And here is your money,\" said the shoemaker, producing the bills. [Pg 271]Major Sturgis received them in amazement bordering upon stupefaction, and counted them over three times. \"I guess they\u0027re all right,\" said Job. \"Where did you get them?\" inquired the major, unable to control his curiosity. \"I guess that doesn\u0027t matter so long as they\u0027re good,\" answered Job. \"Still, I\u0027ve no objection to tellin\u0027 you that it\u0027s Ben\u0027s money that he\u0027s kindly lent to me.\" \"Did you bring this from California?\" asked the major, turning to our hero. \"Yes, sir,\" answered Ben. \"Have you any more?\" \"I\u0027ve got enough more, so that I don\u0027t expect to need the situation Sam thought of offering me.\" When Major Sturgis left the cottage his grand air had passed off, and he looked disappointed and mortified. Sam\u0027s spirits, too, were perceptibly dashed when he learned that the boy he disliked had been successful in California. \"That settles the major,\" said Ben. \"This after[Pg 272]noon I will see what I can do in the case of Richmond.\" \"You can\u0027t do anything, Ben,\" said his aunt. \"Leave him to the reproaches of his own conscience.\" \"He hasn\u0027t got any conscience, Aunt Clarissa,\" said Ben.—\"Jake, will you ride over with me to the next town this afternoon?\" \"I shall be glad to, Ben.\" Ben went at once to the office of an able lawyer, engaged his services, and put the matter into his hands. The result was, that John Richmond received a note by messenger summoning him to the lawyer\u0027s office. He at first tried to bluster, then to temporize, but the lawyer was stern and threatened to exhaust the resources of the law in behalf of his clients. Like most bullies, Richmond was a coward, and ended by giving a note for the full amount, with interest, at thirty days. \"You had better leave this note with me,\" said the lawyer to Ben; \"I will collect it when due.\" And he did. With a crestfallen air John Richmond had to confess himself defeated in his[Pg 273] mean attempt at swindling, for he had obtained Uncle Job\u0027s indorsement with the deliberate intention of leaving him to pay the note, supposing that the old man would be too timid to do anything about it. Ben remained in Hampton a week. During that time he bought the three-acre lot adjoining—the major having given up the purchase when his plan of getting possession of Job Stanton\u0027s little property fell through—and gave it to his uncle. This made Job feel like a rich man, and he only accepted it on Ben\u0027s assurance that he had plenty more money. At the end of a week Ben received a letter from Richard Dewey, informing him that he proposed to go into business for himself in the city of New York, and was anxious to engage Ben as a clerk. This offer was too good to refuse. So Ben, a month later, found himself in a responsible business position. As his employer within a few months came into possession of his wife\u0027s large fortune, which her guardian was reluctantly obliged to surrender, he was not hampered by[Pg 274] lack of capital, but within a year had his business securely established. Ten years have passed. Ben is now junior partner, and enjoys a high reputation for business ability. A year since he married his cousin Jennie, and in so doing has made a wise choice. He lives in the city, but Uncle Job and his wife still live in Hampton, though Job is no longer compelled to work for a livelihood. He has given up his shop, and confines himself to the cultivation of his small tract of land. Though now seventy, his eye is not dim nor his natural force abated. Major Sturgis is dead, and Sam, it is understood, has wasted a considerable portion of the handsome property that was left him. It is quite possible that he may end in poverty and destitution, and be forced at last to work for a living. This he would regard as a misfortune, but it will probably be a blessing in disguise, for the necessity of honest labor is generally a salutary restraint. Bradley has gone back to California. His son in now with him, and both are prosperous. Richard Dewey and his wife are rich and happy (the[Pg 275] two do not always go together), and have four children, the second of whom, a boy, is named Benjamin Stanton Dewey, in honor of our hero. I have endeavored to ascertain what became of our Mongolian friend, Ki Sing, but without entire success. My impression is, that he started a laundry in San Francisco, made enough money for a Chinaman to retire upon, and went back to his native land to live in competence, the happy husband of a high-born Chinese maiden with incredibly small feet. Doubtless, he has more than once retailed to wondering ears the account of his adventures and perils when he, as well as Ben, visited California \"in search of fortune.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81250.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
