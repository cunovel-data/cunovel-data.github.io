{"id":30419,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII. THE HOUSE IS MORTGAGED.","content":"Job Stanton would not have been more utterly overwhelmed if he had seen his treasured home reduced to ashes before his eyes. That he should be responsible for a debt of five hundred dollars seemed to him almost incredible. The trader\u0027s representation that indorsing the note was only a matter of form he had accepted as strictly true. \"Well, what are you going to do about it?\" asked the major, impatiently. \"\u0027Goin\u0027 to do about it\u0027?\" ejaculated Job. \"Certainly. When a man indorses a note he knows that he may be called upon to pay, and of course has some plan for doing it.\" \"I don\u0027t know what to do,\" said the poor shoemaker, sadly. \"I can\u0027t pay the note.\" \"Humph! There seems to be only one thing to do, then.\" [Pg 256]\"What is it?\" \"You must sell or mortgage your place.\" \"What! sell or mortgage my house? I can\u0027t do that, Major Sturgis.\" \"Very well. I won\u0027t insist on it if you can pay the note in any other way.\" \"Heaven knows I can\u0027t.\" \"Then, Mr. Stanton,\" said the major, sharply, \"it\u0027s time to speak plainly. Unless you do as I suggest, I shall attach your property and compel you to raise the money in the way I indicate.\" Job Stanton was mortally afraid of legal proceedings, and after a while he acceded to the major\u0027s proposal, which was himself to accept a mortgage for the sum of five hundred dollars secured upon the place. His wife, who had to be told, wept bitterly, for it seemed to her as if they were parting with their main reliance. But Major Sturgis carried his point, and walked off triumphant. And now for the major\u0027s motive, for he had one, and he had artfully made use of Richmond to forward his plan: He was desirous of getting possession of the poor shoemaker\u0027s house and land,[Pg 257] having in view the purchase of the lot adjoining. Then he would move the house off, throw down the fence between the two lots, build a nice dwelling, and rent it to a city friend who wished to spend his summers in Hampton. He knew very well that Job Stanton wouldn\u0027t listen to a proposition for selling his house, and he therefore tried to accomplish by stratagem what he could not fairly. \"Pa, you are looking in good spirits,\" said Sam Sturgis when his father came home. \"I don\u0027t feel so,\" said the major, hypocritically. \"I have had to do a very disagreeable thing this morning.\" \"What was it?\" Sam asked, his curiosity being excited. \"Mr. Richmond the trader owed me a note for five hundred dollars, indorsed by Job Stanton, and as he did not pay it, I had to call on Stanton.\" \"He couldn\u0027t pay—he\u0027s too poor,\" said Sam. \"Not in money, but he owns his place. I have accepted a mortgage for six months\u0027 time on his house and lot.\" [Pg 258]\"Suppose he doesn\u0027t pay when the time comes?\" \"I am afraid I shall have to foreclose the mortgage.\" \"And he\u0027ll have to leave, won\u0027t he?\" \"Unless he can raise the money some other way.\" \"There isn\u0027t any other way, is there?\" \"Richmond might hand over the money by that time.\" \"Do you think he will?\" \"He ought to, but I don\u0027t think there is much chance of it.\" \"Ben will be rather astonished when he comes home and finds his uncle has lost his place.\" \"Yes, I suppose he will.\" \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t be sorry for him. He puts on a good many airs, considering how poor he is. I wish I knew how he is getting along in California.\" \"He may get a living there, but that is about all,\" said the major. \"I shouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if his uncle came to me for money to get him home.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t let him have it, would you, pa?\" [Pg 259]\"I might,\" answered Major Sturgis, \"if he would surrender the place to me without putting me to inconvenience.\" \"Would you take Ben for my servant, pa, in that case?\" \"Why do you want him for a servant?\" \"I want to humble his pride,\" answered Sam, with a gleam of something like hatred in his eyes. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81248.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
