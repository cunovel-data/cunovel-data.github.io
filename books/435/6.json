{"id":30392,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V. FURTHER ADVENTURES OF BILL MOSELY.","content":"Bill Mosley and his companion pushed on after leaving the poor Chinaman tied to the tree. \"The yellow heathen may starve, for all I care,\" said Mosely, carelessly. \"It\u0027s all his own fault. Why didn\u0027t he speak up like a man and tell me what I wanted to know?\" \"I should say so,\" chimed in Tom Hadley. \"The question is now, \u0027Whereabouts is that cabin we are in search of?\u0027\" Hadley appeared to have no idea, and no suggestion to offer. \"It strikes me it must be somewhere near the top of the mountain,\" said Mosely. \"What do you say?\" \"I should say so.\" \"Then we\u0027ll take the shortest way to the summit. I tell you, Tom, we\u0027re on the track of something[Pg 47] rich. We\u0027ll take all this fellow\u0027s gold-dust, and he can\u0027t help himself. It\u0027ll be richer than any claim we\u0027ve worked yet, if it pans out as well as I expect—eh, Tom?\" \"I should say so, Bill,\" answered Hadley, with an expression of interest. \"I tell you, Tom,\" said Bill Mosely, complacently, \"you were in luck when you fell in with me. We\u0027ve done pretty well since we j\u0027ined hosses, pard.\" \"I should say so—but,\" added Hadley, after a pause, \"it would go hard with us if we got caught.\" \"We don\u0027t mean to get caught,\" said Mosely, promptly. \"As for this new job, there\u0027s no danger in it. This man is down with a broken leg, and he can\u0027t help our taking his gold. The Chinaman\u0027s out of the way, and we\u0027ve got a clear field. Take a good look, Tom, for your eyes are better than mine, and tell me if you see anything that looks like a cabin anywhere around?\" This inquiry was made some twenty minutes after they had left Ki Sing. They had pursued a circuitous course, or in half the time they might have been as near the cabin as they now were. [Pg 48]Tom Hadley didn\u0027t answer in his customary phrase, but instead raised himself erect on his mustang and looked sharply about him. \"Well?\" demanded Mosely, impatiently. \"I don\u0027t see anything that looks like a cabin,\" said Hadley, deliberately, \"but I think I see smoke.\" \"Where?\" asked his companion in an eager tone. \"There,\" said Tom Hadley, pointing with his whip in a particular direction. Mosely strained his eyes, but he was a trifle near-sighted and could see nothing. \"I can\u0027t see anything,\" he said, \"but that proves nothing. If there\u0027s smoke, there\u0027s a house. There\u0027s no question about that, and there\u0027s not likely to be more than one cabin about here. Steer in the direction of the smoke, Tom, and I\u0027ll follow in your tracks. My horse is getting tired; he\u0027ll be glad to rest for the night.\" \"Will it be safe?\" queried Hadley. \"Safe enough. The Chinaman is disposed of, and as for this broken-legged Dewey, we\u0027ll bind him fast and set him outside of the cabin while we make ourselves comfortable within. I shall be sorry to[Pg 49] inconvenience him, but when a man has company he must expect to be put out—eh, Tom?\" \"I should say so, Bill.\" The two worthy gentlemen kept on their way till, making a sudden turn, the house, which had hitherto been concealed from them by a cliff, stood plainly revealed. \"There it is, Tom!\" cried Mosely, joyfully. \"We\u0027ve found it, in spite of that lying heathen. It seems good to see a house after wandering about for weeks without a chance to sleep under a roof—eh, Tom?\" \"I should say so, Bill.\" It will be observed that Mr. William Mosely was fond of designating Ki Sing as a heathen, evidently appreciating his own superiority as a Christian. Yet I am inclined to think that a heathen like the Chinaman possessed more moral worth than a dozen Christians of the type of Mosely. From youth he had preyed upon the community, and his aim had been to get a living in any way that did not involve labor. Honesty was an obsolete word in his vocabulary, and a successful theft yielded him a satisfaction such as other men derive from the consciousness of well-doing.[Pg 50] In fact, Mosely\u0027s moral nature was warped, and there was very little chance of his reformation. Now that the cabin was near at hand, the two men did not quicken their speed, for the ascent was somewhat steep and their animals were tired. \"Take it easy, Tom. The whole thing\u0027s in our hands. Wonder whether Dewey\u0027s expectin\u0027 visitors?\" he added, chuckling. \"I say, Hadley, he\u0027ll be glad to see us—don\u0027t you think so?\" \"I should say so,\" returned Hadley, before the joke dawned upon him. \"You see, we are going to relieve him of the care of that gold-dust of his. We\u0027re two bankers from \u0027Frisco, that\u0027s what we are, and we\u0027ll take care of all the gold-dust we can take in.\" \"I shall want my half,\" said Tom Hadley, unexpectedly deviating from his customary formula. Mosely shrugged his shoulders. He did not quite like this new disposition of Hadley\u0027s to look after his own interests, but at present did not think it politic to say much about it. Though Tom Hadley had generally been subservient to him, he knew very well that if any difficulty should arise between them[Pg 51] Tom would be a formidable antagonist. Fortunately for him, Hadley did not know his own power, or he would not have remained in subjection to a man whom he could have overcome had he been so disposed. He did not fully believe Bill Mosely\u0027s ridiculous boasts of his own prowess, but he was nevertheless disposed to overrate the man who made so many pretensions. All he asked was a fair share of the booty which the two together managed to secure, and this he had made up his mind to have. They reached the cabin at last, and halted their horses before the door. Both sprang off, and Bill Mosely, with a sign to his companion to remain in charge of them, entered at the open door. \"Is that you, Ki Sing?\" asked Dewey, whose face was turned toward the wall. Bill Mosely could not tell from the way he lay on the pallet, covered with a blanket, whether his leg were broken or not, but believed that this was the case. \"That doesn\u0027t happen to be my name, stranger,\" he answered. Richard Dewey turned suddenly on his low bed[Pg 52] and fixed his eyes on the intruder. \"Who are you? what do you want?\" he demanded suspiciously. \"I thought I\u0027d come round and make you a call, being in the neighborhood,\" answered Mosely, with a smile. \"Who are you?\" \"Well, I\u0027m not the President of the United States, nor I ain\u0027t Queen Victoria, as I know of,\" said Mosely. \"You look more like a horse-thief,\" said Richard Dewey, bluntly. \"Do you mean to insult me?\" exclaimed Bill Mosely, fiercely. \"Do you know who I am?\" Dewey was not easily frightened, and he answered coolly, \"You haven\u0027t told me yet.\" \"Well, I\u0027m Bill Mosely from the State of Missouri. I\u0027m a regular tearer, I am. I don\u0027t take no back talk. When a man insults me I kill him.\" \"Very well. Now I know who you are,\" said Richard Dewey, calmly. \"Now, what do you want?\" \"How much gold-dust have you in this cabin? We may as well come to business.\" [Pg 53]\"None at all.\" \"I know better. You can\u0027t pull wool over my eyes. Your Chinaman tells a different story.\" \"Ha! Have you seen Ki Sing?\" asked Dewey, interested at last. \"Yes, I had the pleasure of meeting the heathen you refer to.\" \"Where is he now? Can you tell me?\" \"To the best of my knowledge he is tied to a tree a mile or so from here. I don\u0027t think he will get away very easily.\" \"Scoundrel! you shall answer for this!\" exclaimed Richard Dewey, springing to his feet, and thereby showing that neither of his legs was broken.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81221.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
