{"id":30398,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XI. PLANS FOR DEPARTURE.","content":"The recovery of the horses was in one respect especially fortunate. Richard Dewey was anxious to leave the mountain-cabin as soon as possible and make his way to San Francisco, where, as we know, his promised wife was anxiously awaiting him. But there was considerable danger that his ankle, which had been severely sprained, would not be in a condition for travelling for a considerable time yet. The rough mountain-paths would have tried it, and perhaps a second sprain would have resulted. Now, however, he would be able to ride on one of the horses, and need not walk at all if he pleased. This idea occurred to Jake Bradley, who suggested it to Richard Dewey. Dewey\u0027s face brightened up, for he was secretly[Pg 96] chafing over the delay made necessary by his accident. \"But, my friend,\" he said, \"it would be selfish in me to take your horse and leave you to go on foot.\" \"Look here, Dick Dewey,\" said Bradley: \"what do you take me for? Do you think I\u0027m so delicate I can\u0027t walk? I wasn\u0027t brought up in no such way. I can do my regular share of trampin\u0027, whether on the prairie or on the mountain. I ain\u0027t no tender-foot.\" \"I don\u0027t doubt your strength and endurance, friend Bradley,\" said Dewey, \"but a man doesn\u0027t always like to do what he is fully able to do.\" \"Then we needn\u0027t say no more about it. There\u0027s a gal—I beg your pardon, a young lady—in \u0027Frisco that\u0027s pinin\u0027 to see you, Dick Dewey, and that hoss\u0027ll get you there sooner\u0027n if you waited till you could walk.\" \"I am too selfish to resist your arguments, my good friend,\" said Dewey. \"I think I can venture to start within a week, as I am to ride.\" \"No doubt of it.\" \"You\u0027d better let me buy your horse, and then[Pg 97] if we don\u0027t meet again, or anything happens to it, you won\u0027t be the loser.\" \"\u0027If we don\u0027t meet again\u0027?\" repeated Bradley, puzzled. \"You don\u0027t mean to say you are goin\u0027 to set out alone?\" \"I don\u0027t want to take you and Ben away from your claim. It isn\u0027t half exhausted yet.\" \"Then let somebody else exhaust it,\" returned Bradley. \"You don\u0027t suppose, Dick, we are goin\u0027 to let you go off alone?\" \"I shall not be alone. My faithful attendant, Ki Sing, will be with me.\" \"And what good would Ki Sing be in case you fell in with a grizzly? I want to know that,\" asked Bradley. \"I don\u0027t say anything against the heathen; he\u0027s squarer than many a white man I\u0027ve met with, and he\u0027s worth a dozen such men as Bill Mosely and Tom Hadley; but, all the same, he wouldn\u0027t be much in a scrimmage. Them Chinamen are half women, accordin\u0027 to my reckonin\u0027. They look like it and speak like it. No, Ben and I go when you do, and the first man that comes along is welcome to the claim.\" [Pg 98]\"I shall certainly be delighted to have you both with me,\" said Richard Dewey. \"You\u0027re a good fellow, Jake Bradley, and I trust you more than any man I have met since I came to California. Ben acted as escort to Florence, and I owe him a debt for that which I hope some day to repay.\" \"Then it\u0027s all fixed,\" said Bradley, in a tone of satisfaction. \"We four are to keep together till we see you within reach of \u0027Frisco. When you and your young lady meet you won\u0027t need us any more.\" Richard Dewey smiled. \"Florence will wish to thank you for your kind care of me, Bradley,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve no objection to that. You can invite me to the weddin\u0027, Dick.\" \"I give you that invitation now, and hope you may not have long to wait for the occasion. All difficulties are not yet removed, but I hope they may vanish speedily. I get impatient sometimes, but I try to curb my impatient feeling.\" \"I reckon I would feel so myself if I was in your fix,\" observed Bradley. [Pg 99]\"I hope you may be, Jake.\" Bradley shook his head. \"I\u0027m a cross-grained old bachelor,\" he said, \"and I reckon no gal would look at me twice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2954/81227.html","bookId":435,"book":{"id":435,"title":"Ben\u0027s Nugget A Boy\u0027s Search For Fortune","description":"简介： Ben\u0027s Nugget is the concluding volume of the Pacific Series.
