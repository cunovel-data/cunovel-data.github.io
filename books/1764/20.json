Thirteen, was it?” Ms. Harlan says. “But do you remember anything at all about her or your brother being angry with the king? Questioning the rules that keep Internment functioning?”\\n\\n “No.” Also a lie. I had never seen Lex so angry in my life.\\n\\n “It’s all right. They aren’t going to be in any trouble,” Ms. Harlan says. “Questions are normal after procedures like that.”\\n\\n “I really wouldn’t know,” I say.\\n\\n Procedures. Like “incident,” this is another word that covers a broad range of unpleasant things. There is the termination procedure. The dispatch procedure. The dusting procedure that reduces bodies to ash. The mercy procedure that dispatches the infants who are born unwell. Lex wrestled with these things constantly as a pharmacist. I would never hope to know the things he has seen.\\n\\n Mercifully, the bell rings. I’m gone even before the tea has had a chance to cool.\\n\\n Basil is waiting for me outside the headmaster’s office, and immediately I go under his waiting arm, and he steers me away from Ms. Harlan and her questions. It’s Friday, but the thought that I’ll have two days free of questioning does little to settle me.\\n\\n “What did she say?” Basil asks.\\n\\n “She knows,” I say softly. “I don’t know what it is, but it’s something about my family.”\\n\\n After class, Pen and I walk to Brass Beans Trinket Shop. It’s a little toy store modeled after a storybook castle, complete with a balcony atop a tower. We don’t actually have castles—they’re too large and impractical—but the notion of them has existed for as long as Internment has been above the ground, like a secret we were never meant to have. Or maybe the stories of castles on the ground are untrue, and we dreamed them up for ourselves. Even the princess has said she longs to live in one; our centuries-old clock tower is as close as she’ll come to that.\\n\\n Pen and I fell in love with the trinket shop when we were toddlers and never quite outgrew it. We have an annual tradition of picking out our festival of stars gifts here and exchanging them early.\\n\\n Though the people of Internment don’t exchange gifts for birthdays, Pen’s and my festival gifts also double as late birthday presents, because it marks the anniversary of our friendship. Her birthday is only a handful of days after mine; in fact, that’s how our mothers met and how we came to be friends. She was part of an October batch of due dates, while I was to be part of a November group, right along with Basil. But in late October, my mother was rushed to a hospital room with early labor pains, just as Pen’s mother was being dismissed from it with false labor. We were both eventually born that week—I too eager, and Pen too hesitant.\\n\\n “Do you suppose we’ll come here even when we’re in dodder housing?” I ask.\\n\\n “I intend to die young,” Pen says, tapping at each in a row of tiny wooden princes and princesses. “Tragically, I hope. You’re immortalized if that’s how you go.”\\n\\n “Be serious,” I say.\\n\\n “This is no place for that,” she says. She hoists a small metal insect in the palm of her hand. She squints at its tail, reading the tiny label affixed to it. It’s modeled after a quartet flutterling, if the four wings and long tail are any indication. I see them by the water, mostly.\\n\\n Pen tugs at a tiny thread on its back, and with a mechanical whine it takes flight, spiraling busily around our heads. She squeaks with delight.\\n\\n She intends to die young, she says. I think she’d make a brilliant old woman, though, surrounded by toys and tonics, saying crude things and flinging water balls at the young lovers holding hands.\\n\\n The quartet flutterling lands on her shoulder. “I want this,” she says. “Think how much more fun it’ll be when we’re drunk off tonic.” It has happened only a handful of times, and mostly in the year following Lex’s incident. Pen would bring a bottle of her mother’s spirits to our cavern and tell me it would take the sting out. For a couple of hours it did, I suppose, but my life was still waiting for me in the morning, and I’d have to face it with a headache.\\n\\n “I want you to have a gift you can enjoy while you’re sober,” I say.\\n\\n She hugs the flutterling protectively to her shoulder. “I will. Do you see anything you’d like?”\\n\\n I stare at a row of bound journals. Like all other books on Internment, the blank pages in those journals are recycled. They’ll be mostly white, but there will be shadowy flecks, bits of someone else’s handwriting, fragments of old images. Pure white pages are expensive and rare; my brother has the scrolls for his transcriber only because they’re considered necessary for the blind, and the words are printed with indents so he can feel them, which is why the paper must be unblemished.\\n\\n I saw him rip apart a manuscript in a fit of frustration one afternoon, and I wanted to scream.\\n\\n “Not yet,” I say.\\n\\n “We could try upstairs,” Pen says, petting her new toy. “Do you need to get something for Lex?”\\n\\n “No,” I say. “He says the best gift I can give him any year is peace and quiet. He says I snore and it disturbs his writing.”\\n\\n “You don’t snore,” Pen assures. “He just loves to tease you.”\\n\\n “You’re lucky you’re an only child,” I say.\\n\\n We move up the creaky wooden steps, through a tunneling stairwell that’s lit by flame lanterns on the wall.\\n\\n For no logical reason at all, I think of Judas, all angles in the moonlight, and of Basil, who kissed me when I told him I feared going crazy. I’m only just beginning to feel for him the way that Alice feels for Lex, the way my mother feels for my father. It’s an injustice that Judas’s betrothed is dead at any age, but especially at this one.\\n\\n Did they ever kiss? Were they in love, or will Judas spend the rest of his life never getting to know what that feels like?\\n\\n “You’re being quiet,” Pen pouts. We reach the top of the staircase and she tugs the thread, setting the flutterling in the air again.\\n\\n “Basil kissed me,” I say.\\n\\n The flutterling lands in her palm.\\n\\n “At last,” she says. “I was beginning to wonder about his sexuality. You’ve no idea how close I was to grabbing a brochure from the infirmary about those natural attraction classes.”\\n\\n I feel my face go warm. “You were not.”\\n\\n “How was it?” she says.\\n\\n I’m looking at my shoes, and I don’t have to say anything, because my smile tells her everything she needs to know.\\n\\n She wraps her arm around my shoulders, leading me toward shelves of water balls, dirt candies, and other assorted pranks. “Let’s find you something childish, quick, before you grow up completely.”\\n\\n The food is gone when I check the cavern again.\\n\\n If Judas is lurking nearby, Amy won’t be with him. The jumper group meets tonight.\\n\\n “I’m leaving this here,” I say to the trees as I set another package in the same spot as before. “It’s apple cinnamon bread. It’s my favorite. My mother bakes it because she says it reminds her of when I was little and it was the only thing I’d ask to eat.”\\n\\n After a while, a voice above me answers, “Your mother’s an excellent cook.” The branches rustle overhead as a shadow jumps from them to land before me. “All mine ever makes is soup, and it isn’t very good soup at that.”\\n\\n I cant my head. “Is that where you were hiding last night?” I ask.\\n\\n “If I told you, I wouldn’t be a very good hider,” Judas says, ducking into the cavern.\\n\\n I follow after him, and then set my pocket light between us as we sit on the dirt. It doesn’t have much of a glow, but at least he can see the food package.\\n\\n He eats, and I try not to bother him. I don’t want to scare him away, but I’m brimming with questions and confessions. I want to tell him about the talk on the train of jurors, and the specialist questioning me about my family. I want to ask him about Daphne—what he knows about her death, if he misses her, if he loved her.\\n\\n He looks at me and stops chewing, mouth full, and says, “What?”\\n\\n I realize I’m staring and look at my lap. “How is Amy so …” I try to find the right word. “Together?”\\n\\n “Together?” He takes another bite.\\n\\n “It’s just that my brother is a jumper, too, and I’ve seen enough of them to know that it leaves scars. But she seems fine.”\\n\\n He watches me a moment, considering whether or not I’m one to trust. Or maybe he thinks me too stupid to understand the enormity. “She’s a strange girl,” he says. “Always has been, always will be. She somehow made it to the edge all by herself when she was seven. Wandered off during outdoor recreation at the academy.”\\n\\n Seven?\\n\\n “She was unconscious when the patrolman found her. It’s been a matter of debate whether or not she knew what she was doing. Her parents will say that she just wandered off, and that she didn’t understand and wasn’t paying attention. She liked bugs. Flutterlings and bramble flies—anything with wings, she’d chase. They said she must have gone after something and lost track of where she’d wandered.”\\n\\n “But you think otherwise?” I ask.\\n\\n “I do,” he says. “But she doesn’t remember why she did it. That’s the thing. When she woke up, she didn’t seem injured, but her mind wasn’t quite right. She forgets things. She has fits where her eyes go back and no amount of calling will get her to hear you, and she senses things. Says she knows when someone is being dispatched and can hear their thoughts floating away on the wind. Her grandmother died of the sun disease, and Amy dreams about her all the time. Says she’s being haunted by her ghost. Her parents took her to a specialist for a while.”\\n\\n I don’t say that I’m meeting with a specialist myself. “Did it help?” I ask.\\n\\n “Sure,” Judas says. “It taught her to be a better liar.”\\n\\n Amy’s mind hasn’t been quite right.\\n\\n Judas’s words stay with me on the walk home. Maybe that’s why she’s so trusting of Judas. Maybe he did murder Daphne.\\n\\n If something is wrong with her, then it’s wrong with me as well, because I don’t believe Judas had anything to do with Daphne’s death.\\n\\n Pen is perched on the stairwell when I get home. She’s wearing a flannel nightgown and her hair is plaited to set her curls when she sleeps. “You left without me,” she says.\\n\\n She looks exhausted, or just sad.\\n\\n “I know,” I say. “I’m sorry. I didn’t want to scare him off. Give me some time and then I’ll introduce you.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-ruin-the-internment-chronicles-1/page-20.html","bookId":1764,"book":{"id":1764,"title":"Perfect Ruin (The Internment Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Ruin (The Internment Chronicles #1) \\n On the floating city of Internment, you can be anything you dream, unless you approach the edge.
