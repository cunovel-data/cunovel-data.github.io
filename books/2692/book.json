Caught with his pants down, he finds himself bucked right off the PBR tour until he can get his act together. Hollywood actress Ava Dumond became the tabloids’ favorite target when her longtime boyfriend was outed as gay. Now she wants a place to lay low and a chance to prove to herself that she can satisfy a red-blooded man between the sheets. The sexy, rugged cowboy she finds holed up in her Wyoming hideaway seems like the answer to her every fantasy. But Chase has sworn off women. Forever. Or at least a month. Whichever comes first. When they take to the road to get Chase more hands-on bull riding experience, they have every intention of keeping their hands off each other. But the two headstrong stars quickly end up riding a hot and heady rodeo circuit all their own—until the press gets wind of their affair. When the dust clears and the lights of the paparazzi fade, are they ready to give up chasing the dream for a chance of finding forever?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/chasin-eight-rough-riders-11.jpg","author":"Lorelei James","type":"Western","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":64,"category":{"id":8,"name":"Western","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
