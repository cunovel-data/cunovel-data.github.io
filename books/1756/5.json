{"id":71739,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Bigman\u0027s eyes sparkled. \"It\u0027s never too late once Lucky gets going. Where do we start, Lucky?\"\\n\\n Lucky said quietly, \"With Lou Evans. I\u0027ve been waiting for you to mention him, Dr. Morriss.\"\\n\\n Morriss\u0027s eyebrows drew together; his plump face contracted into a frown. \"You\u0027re his friend. You want to defend him, I know. It\u0027s not a pleasant story. It wouldn\u0027t be if it involved any councilman at all-but a friend at that.\"\\n\\n Lucky said, \"I am not acting out of sentiment only, Dr. Morriss. I knew Lou Evans as well as one man can know another. I know he is incapable of doing anything to harm the Council or Earth.\"\\n\\n \"Then listen, and judge for yourself. For most of Evans\u0027s tour of duty here on Venus, he accomplished nothing. A \u0027trouble shooter\u0027 they called him, which is a pretty word but means nothing.\"\\n\\n \"No offense, Dr. Morriss, but did you resent his arrival?\"\\n\\n \"No, of course not. I just saw no point in it. We here have grown old on Venus. We have the experience. What do they expect a youngster, new from Earth, to accomplish?\"\\n\\n \"A fresh approach is helpful sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"Nonsense. I tell you, Lucky, the trouble is that Earth headquarters don\u0027t consider our problem important. Their purpose in sending Evans was to have him give it a quick glance, whitewash it, and return to tell them it was nothing.\"\\n\\n \"I know the Council on Earth better than that. You do, too.\"\\n\\n But the grumbling Venusian went on. \"Anyway, three weeks ago, this man Evans asked to see some of the classified data concerning yeast-strain growth. The men in the industry objected.\"\\n\\n \"Objected?\" said Lucky. \"It was a councilman\u0027s request.\"\\n\\n \"True, but yeast-strain men are secretive. You don\u0027t make requests like that. Even councilmen don\u0027t. They asked Evans why he wanted the information. He refused to tell them. They forwarded his request to me, and I quashed it.\"\\n\\n \"On what grounds?\" demanded Lucky.\\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t tell me his reasons either, and while I\u0027m senior councilman on Venus, nobody in my organization will have secrets from me. But your friend Lou Evans then did something I had not expected. He stole the data. He used his position as councilman to get inside a restricted area in the yeast-research plants, and he left with microfilms inside his boot.\"\\n\\n \"Surely he had a good reason.\"\\n\\n \"He did,\" said Morriss, \"he did. The microfilms dealt with the nutrient formulas required for the nourishment of a new and very tricky strain of yeast. Two days later a workman making up one component of that mixture introduced a trace of mercury salt. The yeast died, and six months\u0027 work was ruined. The workman swore he\u0027d done no such thing, but he had. Our psychiatrists psychoprobed him. By now, you see, we had a pretty good notion of what to expect. He\u0027d had a blackout period. The enemy still hasn\u0027t stolen the strain of yeast, but they\u0027re getting closer. Right?\"\\n\\n Lucky\u0027s brown eyes were hard. \"I can see the obvious theory. Lou Evans had deserted to the enemy, whoever he is.\"\\n\\n \"Sirians,\" blurted Morriss. \"I\u0027m sure of it.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" admitted Lucky. The inhabitants of the planets of Sirius had, for centuries now, been Earth\u0027s most fervent enemies. It was easy to blame them. \"Maybe. Lou Evans deserted to them, let us say, and agreed to get data for them that would enable them to start trouble inside the yeast factories. Little, troubles at first, which would pave the way for larger troubles.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s my theory. Can you propose any other? \"Couldn\u0027t Councilman Evans himself be under mental domination?\"\\n\\n \"Not likely, Lucky. We have many cases in our files now. No one who has suffered from mental domination has blacked out for longer than half an hour, and all gave clear indication under the psychoprobe of periods of total amnesia. Evans would have had to be under mental domination for two days to have done what he did, and he gave no signs of amnesia.\"\\n\\n \"He was examined?\"\\n\\n \"He certainly was. When a man is found with classified material in his possession-caught in the act, as it were-steps have to be taken. I wouldn\u0027t care if he were a hundred times a councilman. He was examined, and I, personally, put him on probation. When he broke it to send some message on his own equipment, we tapped his scrambler and made sure he\u0027d do it no more-or, at least, not without our intercepting whatever he sent or received. The message he sent you was his last. We\u0027re through playing with him. He\u0027s under confinement now. I\u0027m preparing my report for central headquarters, a thing I should have done before this, and I\u0027m requesting his removal from office and trial for corruption, or, perhaps, for treason.\"\\n\\n \"Before you do that...\" said Lucky.\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Let me speak to him.\"\\n\\n Morriss rose, smiling ironically. \"You wish to? Certainly. I\u0027ll take you to him. He\u0027s in this building. In fact, I\u0027d like to have you hear his defense.\"\\n\\n They passed up a ramp, quiet guards snapping to attention and saluting.\\n\\n Bigman stared at them curiously. \"Is this a prison or what?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a kind of prison on these levels,\" said Morriss. \"We make buildings serve many purposes on Venus.\"\\n\\n They stepped into a small room, and suddenly, quite without warning, Bigman burst into loud laughter.\\n\\n Lucky, unable to repress a smile, said, \"What\u0027s the matter, Bigman?\"\\n\\n \"No-nothing much,\" panted the little fellow, his eyes moist. \"It\u0027s just that you look so funny, Lucky, standing there with your bare upper lip hanging out. After all those mustaches I\u0027ve been watching, you look deformed. You look as though someone had taken a whiffgun and blown off the mustache you should have had.\"\\n\\n Morriss smiled at that and brushed his own grizzled mustache with the back of his hand, self-consciously and a little proudly.\\n\\n Lucky\u0027s smile expanded. \"Funny,\" he said, \"I was thinking exactly the same about you, Bigman.\"\\n\\n Morriss said, \"We\u0027ll wait here. They\u0027re bringing Evans now.\" His finger moved away from a small pushbutton signal.\\n\\n Lucky looked about the room. It was smaller than Morriss\u0027s own room, more impersonal. Its only furniture consisted of several upholstered chairs plus a sofa, a low table in the center of the room, and two higher tables near the false windows. Behind each of the false windows was a cleverly done seascape. On one of the two high tables was an aquarium; on the other, two dishes, one containing small dried peas and the other, a black, greasy substance.\\n\\n Bigman\u0027s eyes automatically started following Lucky\u0027s about the room.\\n\\n He said, suddenly, \"Say, Lucky, what\u0027s this?\\n\\n He half-ran to the aquarium, bending low, peering into its depths. \"Look at it, will you?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just one of the pet V-frogs the men keep about here,\" said Morriss. \"It\u0027s a rather good specimen. Haven\u0027t you ever seen one?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Lucky. He joined Bigman at the aquarium, which was two feet square and about three feet deep. The water in it was criss-crossed with feathery fronds of weed.\\n\\n Bigman said, \"It doesn\u0027t bite or anything, does it?\" He was stirring the water with a forefinger and bending close to peer inside.\\n\\n Lucky\u0027s head came down next to Bigman\u0027s. The V-frog stared back at them solemnly. It was a little creature, perhaps eight inches long, with a triangular head into which two bulging black eyes were set. It rested on six little padded feet drawn up close to its body. Each foot had three long toes in front and one behind. Its skin was green and froglike, and there were frilly fins, which vibrated rapidly, running down the center line of its back. In place of a mouth it had a beak, strong, curved and parrotlike.\\n\\n As Lucky and Bigman watched, the V-frog started rising in the water. Its feet remained on the floor of the aquarium, but its legs stretched out like extendible stilts, as its numerous leg joints straightened. It stopped rising just as its head was about to pierce the surface.\\n\\n Morriss, who had joined them and was staring fondly at the little beast, said, \"It doesn\u0027t like to get out of the water. Too much oxygen in the air. They enjoy oxygen, but only in moderation. They\u0027re mild, pleasant little things.\"\\n\\n Bigman was delighted. There was virtually no native animal life on Mars, and living creatures of this sort were a real novelty to him.\\n\\n \"Where do they live?\" he asked.\\n\\n Morriss put a finger down into the water and stroked the V-frog\u0027s head. The V-frog permitted it, closing its dark eyes in spasmodic motions that might have meant delight, for all they could guess.\\n\\n Morriss said, \"They congregate in the seaweed in fairly large numbers. They move around in it as though it were a forest. Their long toes can hold individual stems, and their beaks can tear the toughest fronds. They could probably make a mean dent in a man\u0027s finger, but I\u0027ve never known one of them to bite. I\u0027m amazed you haven\u0027t seen one yet. The hotel has a whole collection of them, real family groups, on display. You haven\u0027t seen it?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve scarcely had the chance,\" said Lucky dryly.\\n\\n Bigman stepped quickly to the other table, picked up a pea, dipped it into the black grease, and brought it back. He held it out temptingly, and with infinite care the V-frog\u0027s beak thrust out of the water and took the morsel from Bigman\u0027s fingers. Bigman crowed his delight;\\n\\n \"Did you see that?\" he demanded.\\n\\n Morriss smiled fondly, as though at the tricks of a child. \"The little imp. They\u0027ll eat that all day. Look at him gobble it.\"\\n\\n The V-frog was crunching away. A small black droplet leaked out of one side of its beak, and at once the little creature\u0027s legs folded up again as it moved down through the water. The beak opened and the little black droplet was caught.\\n\\n \"What is the stuff?\" asked Lucky.\\n\\n \"Peas dipped in axle grease,\" said Morriss. \"Grease is a great delicacy for them, like sugar for us. They hardly ever find pure hydrocarbon in their natural habitat. They love it so, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if they let themselves be captured just to get it.\"\\n\\n \"How are they captured, by the way?\"\\n\\n \"Why, when the seaweed trawlers gather up their seaweed, there are always V-frogs collected with it. Other animals, too.\"\\n\\n Bigman was saying eagerly, \"Hey, Lucky, let\u0027s you and I get one...\"\\n\\n He was interrupted by a pair of guards, who entered stiffly. Between them stood a lanky, blond young man.\\n\\n Lucky sprang to his feet. \"Lou! Lou, old man!\" He held out his hand, smiling.\\n\\n For a moment it seemed as though the other might respond. A flicker of joy rose to the newcomer\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n It faded quickly. His arms remained stiffly and coldly at his side. He said flatly, \"Hello, Starr.\"\\n\\n Lucky\u0027s hand dropped reluctantly. He said, \"I haven\u0027t seen you since we graduated.\" He paused. What could one say next to an old friend?\\n\\n The blond councilman seemed aware of the incongruity of the situation. Nodding curtly to the flanking guards, he said with macabre humor, \"There\u0027ve been some changes made since then.\" Then, with a spasmodic tightening of his thin lips, he went on, \"Why did you come? Why didn\u0027t you stay away? I asked you to.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t stay away when a friend\u0027s in trouble, Lou.\"\\n\\n \"Wait till your help is asked for.\"\\n\\n Morriss said, \"I think you\u0027re wasting your time, Lucky. You\u0027re thinking of him as a councilman. I suggest that he\u0027s a renegade.\"\\n\\n The plump Venusian said the word through clenched teeth, bringing it down like a lash. Evans reddened slowly but said nothing.\\n\\n Lucky said, \"I\u0027ll need proof to the last atom before I admit any such word in connection with Councilman Evans.\" His voice came down hard on the word \"councilman.\"\\n\\n Lucky sat down. For a long moment he regarded his friend soberly, and Evans looked away.\\n\\n Lucky said, \"Dr. Morriss, ask the guards to leave. I will be responsible for Evans\u0027s security.\"\\n\\n Morriss lifted an eyebrow at Lucky, then after an instant\u0027s thought, gestured to the guards.\\n\\n Lucky said, \"If you don\u0027t mind, Bigman, just step into the next room, will you?\"\\n\\n Bigman nodded and left.\\n\\n Lucky said gently, \"Lou, there are only three of us here now. You, I, Dr. Morriss; that\u0027s all. Three men of the Council of Science. Suppose we start fresh. Did you remove classified data concerning yeast manufacture from their place in the files?\"\\n\\n Lou Evans said, \"I did.\"\\n\\n \"Then you must have had a reason. What was it?\"\\n\\n \"Now look. I stole the papers. I say stole. I admit that much. What more do you want? I had no reason for doing it. I just did it. Now drop it. Get away from me. Leave me alone.\" His lips were trembling.\\n\\n Morriss said, \"You wanted to hear his defense, Lucky. That\u0027s it. He has none.\"\\n\\n Lucky said, \"I suppose you know that there was an accident inside the yeast plants, shortly after you took those papers, involving just the strain of yeast the papers dealt with.\"\\n\\n \"I know all that,\" said Evans.\\n\\n \"How do you explain it?\"\\n\\n \"I have no explanation.\"\\n\\n Lucky was watching Evans closely, searching for some sign of the good-natured, fun-loving, steel-nerved youth he remembered so well at the academy. Except for a new mustache, grown according to Venusian fashion, the man Lucky saw now resembled the memory as far as mere physical appearance was concerned. The same long-boned limbs, the blond hair cut short, the angular, pointed chin, the flat-bellied, athletic body. But otherwise? Evans\u0027s eyes moved restlessly from spot to spot; his lips quivered dryly; his fingernails were bitten and ragged.\\n\\n Lucky struggled with himself before he could put the next blunt question. It was a friend he was talking to, a man he had known well, a. man whose loyalty he never had questioned, and on whose loyalty he would have staked his own life without thought.\\n\\n He said, \"Lou, have you sold out?\"\\n\\n Evans said in a dull, toneless voice, \"No comment.\"\\n\\n \"Lou, I\u0027m asking you again. First, I want you to know that I\u0027m on your side no matter what you\u0027ve done. If you\u0027ve failed the Council, there must be a reason. Tell us that reason. If you\u0027ve been drugged or forced, either physically or mentally, if you\u0027ve been blackmailed or if someone close to you has been threatened, tell us. For Earth\u0027s sake, Lou, even if you\u0027ve been tempted with offers of money or power, even if it\u0027s as crude as that, tell us. There\u0027s no error you can have made that can\u0027t be at least partially retrieved by frankness now. What about it?\"\\n\\n For a moment, Lou Evans seemed moved. His blue eyes lifted in pain to bis friend\u0027s face. \"Lucky,\" he began, \"I...\"\\n\\n Then the softness in him seemed to die, and he cried, \"No comment, Starr, no comment.\"\\n\\n Morriss, arms folded, said, \"That\u0027s it, Lucky. That\u0027s his attitude. Only he has information and we want it, and, by Venus, we\u0027ll get it one way or another.\"\\n\\n Lucky said, \"Wait...\"\\n\\n Morriss said, \"We can\u0027t wait. Get that through your head. There is no tune. No time at all. These so-called accidents have been getting more serious as they get closer to their objective. We need to break this thing now.\" And his pudgy fist slammed down on the arm of his chair, just as the communo shrilled its signal.\\n\\n Morriss frowned. \"Emergency signal! What in space...\"\\n\\n He flicked the circuit open, put the receiver to his ear.\\n\\n \"Morriss speaking. What is it?... What?... WHAT?\"\\n\\n He let the receiver fall, and his face, as it turned toward Lucky, was a doughy, unhealthy white.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a hypnotized man at lock number twenty-three,\" he choked out.\\n\\n Lucky\u0027s lithe body tightened like a steel spring. \"What do you mean by \u0027lock\u0027? Are you referring to the dome?\"\\n\\n Morriss nodded and managed to say, \"I said the accidents are getting more serious. This time, the sea dome. That man may-at any moment-let the ocean into-Aphrodite!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-oceans-of-venus-lucky-starr-3/page-5.html","bookId":1756,"book":{"id":1756,"title":"Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus (Lucky Starr #3)","description":"Storyline: Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus (Lucky Starr #3) \\n El sistema solar ha sido colonizado por la Tierra, unida bajo un solo gobierno presidido por el Consejo de Ciencias. \\n En las profundidades de los océanos de Venus, bajo inmensas cúpulas transparentes, los extraterrestres han contruido maravillosas ciudades submarinas.
