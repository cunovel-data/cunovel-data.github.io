{"id":71746,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"You mean we\u0027re trapped?\" said Bigman, with horror. \"You can put it that way,\" said Lucky coolly. \"You can also say that we\u0027re safe, if you want to. Certainly we\u0027re safer here than anywhere on Venus. Nobody can do anything to us physically with that mountain of dead meat over us. And when the generators are repaired, we\u0027ll just force our way out. Bigman, get at those generators; and Evans, let\u0027s pour ourselves some coffee and talk this thing over. There might not be another chance for a quiet chat.\" Lucky welcomed this respite, this moment when there was nothing to be done but talk and think. Evans, however, was upset. His china-blue eyes crinkled at the corners. Lucky said, \"You look worried?\" \"I am worried. What in space and time do we do?\" Lucky said, \"I\u0027ve been thinking about that. It seems to me that all we can do is get the V-frog story to someone who\u0027s safe from any mental control by them.\" \"And who\u0027s that?\" \"No one on Venus. That\u0027s for sure.\" Evans stared at his friend. \"Are you trying to tell me that everyone on Venus is under control?\" \"No, but anyone might be. After all, there are different ways in which the human mind can be manipulated by these creatures.\" Lucky rested one arm over the back of the pilot swivel and crossed his legs. \"In the first place, complete control can be taken for a short period of time over a man\u0027s mind. Complete control! During that interval a human being can be made to do things contrary to his own nature, things that endanger his own life and others\u0027: the pilots on the coaster, for instance, when Bigman and I first landed on Venus.\" Evans said grimly, \"That type of thing hasn\u0027t been my trouble.\" \"I know. That\u0027s what Morriss failed to realize. He was sure you weren\u0027t under control simply because you showed no signs of amnesia. But there\u0027s a second type of control that you suffered from. It\u0027s less intense, so a person retains his memory. However, just because it\u0027s less intense, a person cannot be forced to do anything against his own nature; you couldn\u0027t be forced to commit suicide, for instance. Still, the power lasts longer-days rather than hours. The V-frogs make up in time what they lose in intensity. Well, there must be still a third kind of control.\" \"And that is?\" \"A control that is still less intense than the second type. A control that is so mild the victim isn\u0027t even aware of it, yet strong enough so that the victim\u0027s mind can be rifled and picked of its information. For instance, there\u0027s Lyman Turner.\" \"The chief engineer on Aphrodite?\". \"That\u0027s right. He\u0027s a case in point. Can you see that? Consider that there was a man at the dome lock yesterday who sat there with a lever in his hand, endangering the whole city, yet he was so tightly protected all around, so netted about with alarms that no one could approach him without warning until Bigman forced a passage through a ventilator shaft. Isn\u0027t that odd?\" \"No. Why is it odd?\" \"The man had only been on the job a matter of months He wasn\u0027t even a real engineer. His work was more like that of a clerk or an office boy. Where did he get the information to protect himself so? How could he possibly know the force and power system in that section of the dome so thoroughly?\" Evans pursed his lips and whistled soundlessly. \"Hey, that is a point.\" \"The point didn\u0027t strike Turner. I interviewed him on just that matter before getting on the Hilda. I didn\u0027t tell him what I was after, of course. He himself told me about the fellow\u0027s inexperience, but the incongruity of the matter never struck him. Yet who would have the necessary information? Who but the chief engineer? Who better than he?\" \"Right. Right.\" \"Well, then, suppose Turner was under very gentle control. The information could be lifted out of his brain. He could be very gently soothed into not seeing anything out of the way in the situation. Do you see what I mean? And then Morriss...\" \"Morriss, too?\" said Evans, shocked. \"Possibly, He\u0027s convinced it\u0027s a matter of Sirians after yeast. He can see it as nothing else. Is that a legitimate misjudgment or is he being subtly persuaded? He was ready to suspect you, Lou-a little too ready; One councilman ought to be a little less prepared to suspect another.\" \"Space! Then who\u0027s safe, Lucky?\" Lucky stared at his empty coffee cup and said, \"No one on Venus. That\u0027s my point. We\u0027ve got to get the story and the truth somewhere else.\" \"And how can we?\" \"A good point. How can we?\" Lucky Starr brooded over that. Evans said, \"We can\u0027t leave physically. The Hilda is designed for nothing but ocean. It can\u0027t navigate the air, let alone space. And if we go back to the city to get something inore suitable, we\u0027d never leave it again.\" \"I think you\u0027re right,\" said Lucky, \"but we don\u0027t have to leave Venus in the flesh. Our information is all that has to leave.\" \"If you mean ship\u0027s radio,\" said Evans, \"that\u0027s out, too. The set we\u0027ve got on this tub is strictly intra-Venus. It\u0027s not a subetheric, so it can\u0027t reach Earth. Down here, as a matter of fact, the instrument won\u0027t reach above the ocean. Its carrier waves are designed to be reflected down from the ocean surface so that they can get distance. Besides that, even if we could transmit straight up, we couldn\u0027t reach Earth.\" \"I don\u0027t see that we have to,\" said Lucky. \"There\u0027s something between here and Earth that would do just as well.\" For a moment, Evans was mystified. Then he said, \"You mean the space stations?\" \"Surely. Two space stations circle Venus. Earth may be anywhere from thirty to fifty million miles away, but the stations may be as close as two thousand miles to this point. Yet there can\u0027t be V-frogs on the stations, I\u0027m sure. Morriss said they dislike free oxygen, and one could scarcely rig up special carbon-dioxide chambers for V-frogs considering the economy with which space stations must be run. Now, if we could get a message out to the stations for relay to central headquarters on Earth, we\u0027d have it.\" \"That\u0027s it, Lucky,\" said Evans, excitedly. \"It\u0027s our way out. Their mental powers can\u0027t possibly reach two thousand miles across space to...\" But then his face turned glum once more. \"No, it won\u0027t do. The subship radio still can\u0027t reach past the ocean surface.\" \"Maybe not from here. But suppose we go up to the surface and transmit from there directly into the atmosphere.\" \"Up to the surface?\" \"Well?\" \"But they are there. The V-frogs.\" \"I know that.\" \"We\u0027ll be put under control.\" \"Will we?\" said Lucky. \"So far they\u0027ve never tackled anyone who\u0027s known about them, known what to expect and made up his mind to resist it. Most of the victims were completely unsuspecting. In your case you actually invited them into your mind, to use your own phrase. Now I am not unsuspecting, and I don\u0027t propose to issue any invitations.\" \"You can\u0027t do it, I tell you. You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like.\" \"Can you suggest an alternative?\" Before Evans could answer, Bigman entered, rolling down his sleeves. \"All set,\" he said. \"I guarantee the generators.\" Lucky nodded and stepped to the controls, while Evans remained in his seat, his eyes clouded with uncertainty. There was the churning of the motors again, rich and sweet. The muted sound was like a song, and there was that strange feeling of suspension and motion under one\u0027s feet that was never felt on a spaceship. The Hilda moved through the bubble of water that had been trapped under the collapsing body of the giant patch and built up speed. Bigman said uneasily, \"How much room do we have?\" \"About half a mile,\" said Lucky. \"What if we don\u0027t make it?\" muttered Bigman. \"What if we just hit it and stick, like an ax in a tree stump?\" \"Then we pull out and try again,\" said Lucky. There was silence for a moment, and Evans said in a low voice, \"Being closed in under here, under the patch -it\u0027s like being in a chamber.\" He was mumbling, half to himself. \"In a what?\" said Lucky. \"In a chamber,\" said Evans, still abstracted. \"They build them on Venus. They\u0027re little transite domes under sea-floor level, like cyclone cellars or bomb shelters on Earth. They\u0027re supposed to be protection against incoming water in case of a broken dome, say by Venus-quake. I don\u0027t know that a chamber has ever been used, but the better apartment houses always advertise that they have chamber facilities in case of emergency.\" Lucky listened to him, but said nothing. The engine pitch rose higher. \"Hold on!\" said Lucky. Every inch of the Hilda trembled, and the sudden, almost irresistible deceleration forced Lucky hard against the instrument panel. Bigman\u0027s and Evans\u0027s knuckles went white and their wrists strained as they gripped the guard rails with all their strength. The ship slowed but did not stop. With the motors straining and the generators protesting in a squeal that made Lucky wince in sympathy, the Hilda plowed through skin and flesh and sinew, through empty bloodvessels and useless nerves that must have resembled two-foot-thick cables. Lucky, jaw set and grim, kept the drive rod nailed at maximum against the tearing resistance. The long minutes passed and then, in a long churn of triumphant engine, they were through-through the monster and out once more into the open sea. Silently and smoothly the Hilda rose through the murky, carbon-dioxide-saturated water of Venus\u0027s ocean. Silence held the three, a silence that seemed enforced by the daring with which they were storming the very fortress of Venus\u0027s hostile life form. Evans had not said a word since the patch had been left behind. Lucky had locked ship\u0027s controls and now sat on the pilot swivel with fingers softly tapping his knee. Even the irrepressible Bigman had drifted glumly to the rear port with its bellying, wide-angle field of vision. Suddenly Bigman called, \"Lucky, look there.\" Lucky strode to Bigman\u0027s side. Together they gazed in silence. Over half the field of the port there was only the starry light of small phosphorescent creatures, thick and soft, but in another direction there was a wall, a monstrous wall glowing in smears of shifting color. \"Do you suppose that\u0027s the patch, Lucky?\" asked Bigman. \"It wasn\u0027t shining that way when we came down here; and anyway, it wouldn\u0027t shine after it was dead, would it?\" Lucky said thoughtfully, \"It is the patch in a way, Bigman. I think the whole ocean is gathering for the feast.\" Bigman looked again and felt a little ill. Of course! There were hundreds of millions of tons of meat there for the taking, and the light they viewed must be the light of all the small creatures of the shallows feeding on the dead monster. Creatures darted past the port, moving always in the same direction. They moved sternward, toward the mountainous carcass the Hilda had left behind. Pre-eminent among them were arrow fish of all sizes. Each had a straight white line of phosphorescence that marked its backbone (it wasn\u0027t a backbone really, but merely an unjointed rod of horny substance). At one end of that white line was a pale yellow V that marked the head. To Bigman it looked indeed as though a countless swarm of animated arrows were swarming past the ship, but in imagination he could see their needle-rimmed jaws, cavernous and ravenous. \"Great Galaxy!\" said Lucky. \"Sands of Mars!\" murmured Bigman. \"The ocean will be empty. Every blasted thing in the ocean is gathering to this one spot.\" Lucky said, \"At the rate those arrow fish must be gorging themselves, the thing will be gone in twelve hours.\" Evans\u0027s voice sounded from behind them. \"Lucky, I want to speak to you.\" Lucky turned. \"Sure. What is it, Lou?\" \"When you first suggested going to the surface, you asked if I could propose an alternative.\" \"I know. You didn\u0027t answer.\" \"I can answer now. I\u0027m holding it, in fact, and the answer is that we\u0027re going back to the city.\" Bigman called, \"Hey, what\u0027s the idea?\" Lucky had no need to ask that question. His nostrils flared, and inwardly he raged at himself for those minutes he had spent at the porthole when all his heart, mind, and soul should have been concentrated on the business at hand. For in Evans\u0027s clenched fist, as it lifted from his side, was Lucky\u0027s own blaster, and in Evans\u0027s narrowed eyes, there was hard determination. \"We\u0027re going back to the city,\" repeated Evans.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-oceans-of-venus-lucky-starr-3/page-12.html","bookId":1756,"book":{"id":1756,"title":"Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus (Lucky Starr #3)","description":"Storyline: Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus (Lucky Starr #3) El sistema solar ha sido colonizado por la Tierra, unida bajo un solo gobierno presidido por el Consejo de Ciencias.
