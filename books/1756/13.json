{"id":71747,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Lucky said, \"what\u0027s wrong, Lou?\" Evans gestured impatiently with his blaster. \"Put the engines in reverse, start bottomward, and turn the ship\u0027s bow toward the city. Not you, Lucky. You let Bigman go to those controls; then you get in line with him, so I can watch both of you and the controls, too.\" Bigman had his hands half-upraised, and his eyes turned to look at Lucky. Lucky kept his hands at his side. Lucky said flatly,\u0027\"Suppose you tell me what\u0027s biting you?\" \"Nothing\u0027s biting me,\" said Evans. \"Nothing at all. It\u0027s what\u0027s biting you. You went out and killed the monster, then came back and started talking about going to the surface. Why?\" \"I explained my reasons.\" \"I don\u0027t believe your reasons. If we surface, I know the V-frogs will take over our minds. I\u0027ve had experience with them, and because of that I know the V-frogs have taken over your mind.\" \"What?\" exploded Bigman. \"Are you nuts?\" \"I know what I\u0027m doing,\" said Evans, watching Lucky warily. \"If you look at this thing coolly, Bigman, you\u0027ll see that Lucky must be under V-frog influence. Don\u0027t forget, he\u0027s my friend, too. I\u0027ve known him longer than you have, Bigman, and it bothers me to have to do this, but there\u0027s no way out. It must be done.\" Bigman stared uncertainly at both men, then said in a low voice, \"Lucky, have the V-frogs really got you?\" \"No,\" said Lucky. \"What do you expect him to say?\" demanded Evans with heat. \"Of course they have him. To kill the monster, he had to jet upward to its top. He must have gone fairly close to the surface where the V-frogs were waiting, close enough for them to snatch him. They let him kill the monster. Why not? They would be glad to trade control of the monster for control of Lucky, so Lucky came back babbling of the need to go to the surface, where we\u0027ll all be among them, all trapped-the only men who know the truth helpless.\" \"Lucky?\" quavered Bigman, his tone pleading for reassurance. Lucky Starr said calmly, \"You\u0027re quite wrong, Lou. What you\u0027re doing now is only the result of your own captivity. You\u0027ve been under control before, and the V-frogs know your mind. They can enter it at will. Maybe they\u0027ve never entirely left it. You\u0027re doing only what you\u0027re being made to do.\" Evans\u0027s grip on his blaster hardened. \"Sorry, Lucky, but it won\u0027t do. Let\u0027s get the ship back to the city.\" Lucky said, \"If you\u0027re not under control, Lou-if you\u0027re mind-free-then you\u0027ll blast me down if I try to force us up to the surface, won\u0027t you?\" Evans did not answer. Lucky said, \"You\u0027ll have to. It will be your duty to the Council and to Mankind to do so. On the other hand, if you are under mental control, you may be forced to threaten me, to try to make me change ship\u0027s course, but I doubt that you can be forced to kill rne. Actually murdering a friend and fellow councilman would be too much against your basic ways of thought. -So give me your blaster.\" Lucky advanced toward the other, hand outstretched. Bigman stared in horror. Evans backed away. He said hoarsely, \"I\u0027m warning you, Lucky. I\u0027ll shoot.\" \"I say you won\u0027t shoot. You\u0027ll give me the blaster.\" Evans was back against the wall. His voice rose craz-ily. \"I\u0027ll shoot. I\u0027ll shoot!\" Bigman cried, \"Lucky, stop!\" But Lucky had already stopped and was backing away. Slowly, very slowly, he backed. The life had suddenly gone out of Evans\u0027s eyes, and he was standing now, a carved stone image, finger firm on trigger. Evans\u0027s voice was cold. \"Back to the city.\" Lucky said, \"Get the ship on the city course, Bigman.\" Bigman stepped quickly to the controls. He muttered, \"He\u0027s really under now, isn\u0027t he?\" Lucky said, \"I was afraid it might happen. They\u0027ve shifted him to intense control to make sure he shoots. And he will, too; no question about it. He\u0027s in amnesia now. He won\u0027t remember this part afterward.\" \"Can he hear us?\" Bigman remembered the pilots on the coaster in which they had landed on Venus and their apparent complete disregard of the external world about them. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" said Lucky, \"but he\u0027s watching the controls and if we deviate from city-direction, he\u0027ll shoot. Make no mistake about that.\" \"Then what do we do?\" Words again issued from between Evans\u0027s pale, cold lips: \"Back to the city. Quickly!\" Lucky, motionless, eyes fixed on the unwavering muzzle of his friend\u0027s blaster, spoke softly and quickly to Bigman. Bigman acknowledged the words by the slightest of nods. The Hilda moved back along the path it had come, back toward the city. Lou Evans, councilman, stood against the wall, white-faced and stern, his pitiless eyes shifting from Lucky to Bigman to the controls. His body, frozen into utter obedience to those who controlled his mind, did not even feel the need of shifting the blaster from one hand to the other. Lucky strained his ears to hear the low sound of Aphrodite\u0027s carrier beam as it sounded steadily on the Hilda\u0027s direction finder. The beam radiated in all directions on a definite wave length from the topmost point of Aphrodite\u0027s dome. The route back to the city became as obvious as though Aphrodite were in plain sight and a hundred feet away. Lucky could tell by the exact pitch of the beam\u0027s low whine that they were not approaching the city directly. It was a small difference indeed, and one that was not at all obvious to the ear. To Evans\u0027s controlled ears, it might pass unnoticed. Fervently, Lucky hoped so. Lucky tried to follow Evans\u0027s blank glare when his eyes rested on the controls. He was certain that it was the depth indicator that those eyes rested upon. It was a large dial, a simple one that measured the water pressure. At the distance Evans stood it was simple enough to tell that the Hilda was not nosing surfaceward. Lucky felt certain that, should the depth-indicator needle vary in the wrong direction, Evans would blast without a moment\u0027s hesitation. Try as he might to think as little as possible about the situation, to allow as few specific thoughts as possible to be picked up by the waiting V-frogs, he could not help but wonder why Evans did not shoot them out of hand. They had been marked for death under the giant patch, but now they were only being herded back to Aphrodite. Or would Evans shoot them down just as soon as the V-frogs could overcome some last scruple in the captive\u0027s subjected mind? The carrier beam moved a little further off pitch. Again Lucky\u0027s eyes flickered quickly in Evans\u0027s direction. Was he imagining it, or did a spark of something (not emotion, exactly, but something) show in Evans\u0027s eyes? A split second later it was obviously more than imagination, for there was a definite tightening of Evans\u0027s biceps, a small lifting of his arm. He was going to shoot! And even as the thought passed quickly through Lucky\u0027s mind and his muscles tensed involuntarily and uselessly for the coming of the blast, the ship crashed. Evans, caught unaware, toppled backward. The blaster slithered from his sprawling fingers. Lucky acted instantly. The same shock that threw Evans back threw him forward. He rode that shock and came down upon the other, clutching for his wrist and seizing it with steely fingers. But Evans was anything but a pigmy, and he fought with the unearthly rage that was imposed upon him. He doubled his knees above him, caught Lucky in the thighs, and heaved. The still rocking ship fortuitously added its roll to the force of Evans\u0027s thrust and the captive councilman was on top. Evans\u0027s fist pounded, but Lucky\u0027s shoulder fended the blow. He raised his own knees and caught Evans in an iron scissors hold just below the hips. Evans\u0027s face distorted with pain. He twisted, but Lucky writhed with him and was on top once more. He sat up, his legs maintaining their hold, increasing it. Lucky said, \"I don\u0027t know if you can hear or under stand me, Lou...\" Evans paid no regard. With one last contortion of his body, he flung himself and Lucky into the air, breaking Lucky\u0027s hold. Lucky rolled as he hit the floor and came lithely to his feet. He caught Evans\u0027s arm as the latter rose and swung it over his shoulder. A heave and Evans came crashing down on his back. He lay still. \"Bigman!\" said Lucky, breathing quickly and brushing back his hair with a quick motion of his hand. \"Here I am,\" said the little fellow, grinning and swinging Turner\u0027s blaster lightly. \"I was all set, just in case.\" \"All right. Put that blaster away, Bigman, and look Lou over. Make sure there are no bones broken. Then tie him up.\" Lucky was at the controls now, and with infinite caution he backed the Hilda off the remnants of the carcass of the giant patch he had killed hours before. Lucky\u0027s gamble had worked. He had hoped that the V-frogs with their preoccupation with mentalities would have no real conception of the physical size of the patch, that with their lack of experience of subsea travel, they would not realize the significance of the slight off-course route Bigman had taken. The whole gamble had been in the quick phrase which Lucky had spoken to Bigman as the latter had turned the ship back to the city under the threat of Evans\u0027s blaster. \"Afoul of the patch,\" he had said. Again the Hilda\u0027s course changed. Its nose lifted upward. Evans, bound to his bunk, stared with weary shame-facedness at Lucky. \"Sorry.\" \"We understand, Lou. Don\u0027t brood about it,\" said Lucky lightly. \"But we can\u0027t let you go for a while. You see that, don\u0027t you?\" \"Sure. Space, put more knots 6n me. I deserve it. Believe me, Lucky, most of it I don\u0027t even remember.\" \"Look, you better get some sleep, fella,\" and Lucky\u0027s fist punched Evans lightly hi the shoulder. \"We\u0027ll wake you when we hit surface, if we have to.\" To Bigman, a few minutes later, he said quietly, \"Round up every blaster on the ship, Bigman, every weapon of every sort. Look through stores, the bunk lockers, everywhere.\" \"What are you going to do?\" \"Dump them,\" said Lucky succinctly. \"What?\" \"You heard me. You might go under. Or I might. If we do, I don\u0027t want anything with which we can expect a repetition of what has just happened. Against the V-frogs, physical weapons are useless, anyway.\" One by one, two blasters, plus the electric whips from each sea suit, passed through the trash ejector. The ejector\u0027s hinged opening stood flush with the wall just next to the first-aid cupboard, and through it the weapons were puffed through one-way valves into the sea. \"It makes me feel naked,\" muttered Bigman, staring out through the port as though to catch sight of the vanished weapons. A dim phosphorescent streak flashed across, marking the passing of an arrow fish. That was all. The water pressure needle dropped slowly. They had been twenty-eight hundred feet under to begin with. They were less than two thousand now. Bigman continued peering intently out the port. Lucky glanced at him. \"What are you looking for?\" \"I thought,\" said Bigman, \"it would get lighter as we got up toward the top.\" \"I doubt it,\" said Lucky. \"The seaweed blankets the surface tightly. It will stay black till we break through.\" \"Think we might meet up with a trawler, Lucky?\" \"I hope not.\" They were fifteen hundred feet under now. Bigman said with an effort at lightness, a visible attempt to change the current of his own thoughts, \"Say, Lucky, how come there\u0027s so much carbon dioxide in the air on Venus? I mean, with all these plants? Plants are supposed to turn carbon dioxide into oxygen, aren\u0027t they?\" \"On Earth they are. However, if I remember my course in xenobotany, Venusian plant life has a trick all its own. Earth plants liberate their oxygen into the air; Venusian plants store theirs as high-oxygen compounds in their tissues.\" He talked absently as though he himself was also using speech as a guard against too-deep thinking. \"That\u0027s why no Venusian animal breathes. They get all the oxygen they need in their food.\" \"What do you know?\" said Bigman in astonishment. \"In fact, their food probably has too much oxygen for them, or they wouldn\u0027t be so fond of low-oxygen food, like the axle grease you fed the V-frog. At least, that\u0027s my theory.\" They were only eight hundred feet from the surface now. Lucky said, \"Good navigation, by the way. I mean the way you rammed the patch, Bigman.\" \"It\u0027s nothing,\" said Bigman, but he flushed with pleasure at the approval in Lucky\u0027s words. He looked at the pressure dial. It was five hundred feet to the surface. Silence fell. And then there came a grating and scraping sound from overhead, a sudden interruption in their smooth climb, a laboring of their engines, and then a quick lightening of the view outside the porthole, together with an eye-blinking vision of cloudy sky and rolling water surface oozing up between shreds and fibers of weed. The water was pockmarked with tiny splashings. \"It\u0027s raining,\" said Lucky. \"And now, I\u0027m afraid, we\u0027ll have to sit tight and wait till the V-frogs come for us.\" Bigman said blankly, \"Well-well... Here they are!\" For moving into view just outside the porthole, staring solemnly into the ship out of dark, liquid eyes, its long legs folded tightly down and its dexterous toes clasping a seaweed stem in a firm grip, was a V-frog!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-oceans-of-venus-lucky-starr-3/page-13.html","bookId":1756,"book":{"id":1756,"title":"Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus (Lucky Starr #3)","description":"Storyline: Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus (Lucky Starr #3) El sistema solar ha sido colonizado por la Tierra, unida bajo un solo gobierno presidido por el Consejo de Ciencias.
