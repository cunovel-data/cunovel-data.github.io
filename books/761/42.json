{"id":14211,"no":42,"title":"ABOU BEN WOODROW","content":"(IN PARIS) Abou Ben Woodrow in bed watching angel reading from scroll Abou Ben Woodrow (may his tribe increase!) Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace, And saw, among the gifts piled on the floor (Making the room look like a department store), An Angel writing in a book of gold. Now much applause had made Ben Woodrow bold And to the Presence in the room said he, \"Qu\u0027est-ce que c\u0027est que ?a que tu ecris?\" Or, in plain English, \"May I not inquire What writest thou?\" The Angel did not tire But kept on scribing. Then it turned its head (All Europe could not turn Ben Woodrow\u0027s head!) And with a voice almost as sweet as Creel\u0027s Answered: \"The names of those who grease the wheels Of progress and have never, never blundered.\" Ben Woodrow lay quite still, and sadly wondered. \"And is mine one?\" he queried. \"Nay, not so,\" Replied the Angel. Woodrow spoke more low But cheerly still, and in his May I notting Fashion he said: \"Of course you may be rotting, But even if you are, may I not then Be writ as one that loves his fellow men? Do that for me, old chap; just that; that merely And I am yours, cordially and sincerely.\" The Angel wrote, and vanished like a mouse. Next night returned (accompanied by House) And showed the names whom love of Peace had blest. And lo! Ben Woodrow\u0027s name led all the rest! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3202/87490.html","bookId":761,"book":{"id":761,"title":"Mince Pie","description":"简介： Those who buy their ink in little stone jugs may prefer to do so because the pottle reminds them of cruiskeen lawn or ginger beer (with its wire-bound cork), but they miss a noble delight.
