A grate Company of Guests assembled at Mt Vernon to celebrate Gen\u0027l Washington\u0027s Birthdaye. In the Morning the Gentlemenn went a Fox hunting, but their Sport was marred by the Pertinacity of some Motion Picture menn who persewd them to take Fillums and catchd the General falling off his Horse at a Ditch.
