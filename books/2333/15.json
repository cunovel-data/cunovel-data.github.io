And I needed something to do. We saw her and evidently put her mind at rest, and you\u0027d think I would have put my own mind to rest in the process.\" \"But you didn\u0027t.\" \"I went and looked at the house,\" I said, \"and that didn\u0027t tell me anything new. And T J printed out the news stories for me, and pulled some other stuff off the Web, and that didn\u0027t tell me much, either.\" \"But you stayed with it.\" \"I did.\" \"Because it was something to do.\" \"I guess so.\" \"And now you\u0027re done?\" \"Not yet. \"You\u0027re staying with it? Because it\u0027s something to do?\" I shook my head. \"Because it\u0027s something that ought to be done,\" I said, \"and who else is going to do it? The cops closed the case.\" \"And they shouldn\u0027t have?\" \"I\u0027m not saying they were wrong,\" I said. \"But I don\u0027t think they got the whole story.\" ELEVEN I called Iverson in the morning and left a message, and around eleven he called me back. \"I was thinking about something you said,\" I told him. \"How they carried everything back with them, the silverware and all.\" \"We recovered it,\" he said, \"down to the last oyster fork.\" \"You happen to know how they made the trip?\" \"Made the trip?\" \"Did either of them have a car?\" \"Not that Motor Vehicles knows about,\" he said. \"You saw the apartment, remember? And I told you how it was furnished. Bierman was lucky if he had a spare pair of jeans. How was he gonna have a car?\" \"So how did they get back to Brooklyn?\" \"How\u0027d you come out here? The D train, isn\u0027t that what you said?\" \"Somehow the idea of those two carrying a couple of sacks of stolen goods on the subwayâ€¦\" \"No, though God knows it wouldn\u0027t be the first time somebody did. Always a chance they flagged a gypsy cab, although that\u0027s not so easy in Manhattan, is it?\" \"No.\" \"So what\u0027s most likely is they stole a car. Hot-wired one, if they knew how, or found one with the keys in it. Drove it to the job, so it was there waiting for them when they came out. Then drove it home.\" \"Did you recover a stolen car in the neighborhood?\" There was a pause, and he sounded a few degrees cooler when he said, \"I don\u0027t believe so, no.\" \"I wonder what happened to it.\" \"If they left the keys in it,\" he said, \"the odds are some other mope stole it, and drove it to some other precinct where it became somebody else\u0027s problem. Or how long did they have it, a couple of hours? Maybe they put it back where they found it, or close enough, and the owner never even knew it was gone.\" \"Maybe.\" \"You trying to make something out of this, Scudder?\" \"I was just wondering.\" \"Yeah, and it\u0027s got me wondering myself. What are you trying to accomplish here, anyway?\" \"Just trying to get a clear picture,\" I said. \"A clear picture. What it sounds like, you\u0027re poking here, poking there, next thing you\u0027re saying we fucked this up, we didn\u0027t look hard enough for the car.\" \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m saying at all.\" \"In the first place,\" he said, \"it stopped being our case the minute we ID\u0027d the chest of sterling. All the same, we went ahead and pursued our end of the investigation. You think we didn\u0027t look for the vehicle?\" \"No, I think you probably did.\" \"You\u0027re damn right we did, looked good and thorough for it. And we checked stolen car reports. We did everything we were supposed to do, including things nobody would have blamed us if we hadn\u0027t done them, because the fucking case was over and done with. We did this a hundred percent right.\" \"That\u0027s exactly what I was hoping to hear,\" I said. \"How\u0027s that?\" \"Suppose there was a third man,\" I said. \"The driver, drove them to Manhattan, waited for them, drove them back.\" \"And?\" \"And dropped them off in front of the house on Coney Island Avenue and then got rid of the car. Lost it in another part of town, if it was stolen. Or, if it was his own car, found a place to park it.\" \"Ran it through a car wash, if he had any sense.\" \"Meanwhile, Bierman and Ivanko are in the apartment, and Bierman shoots Ivanko.\" \"For reasons which remain to this day unclear.\" He sounded a little like W. C. Fields, and his tone told me we were friends again. \"And likely to remain that way,\" I said, \"barring the discovery of a dying message.\" \"Morse code. Dots and dashes, gnawed into the floorboards by the dying Ivanko.\" \"Maybe that\u0027s why he bolts the door,\" I went on. \"So the third man won\u0027t come back in the middle of things.\" \"Or he shoots Ivanko on impulse, and then he bolts the door while he figures out what he\u0027s gonna do next.\" Or so the driver wouldn\u0027t walk in on him while he was doing it, I thought. Or bolting the door was automatic, something he always did when he entered the apartment, because he felt safer that way. \"A third man,\" Iverson said. \"I see where you\u0027re coming from here, and it does a lot to explain the car we never found, but do you have anything to back it up with?\" \"Not really. At this point all it is is a theory.\" \"Nobody saw a third guy on the scene in Manhattan.\" \"Not so far as I know. The trouble with a case that\u0027s closed- \" \"Yeah, I know. There\u0027s things you would follow up otherwise. There was a guy visited Bierman a couple of times. Maybe it was the third man, the mysterious Mr. X.\" \"When was this?\" \"Who knows? Bierman was pretty mysterious himself, far as his neighbors were concerned. Kept to himself, just went out to buy beer and pizza. Word is he had a guy who dropped in a couple of times, but nobody could say just when. We more or less assumed the guy was Ivanko.\" \"The description fit?\" \"Description? \u0027Dude was wearin\u0027 a baseball cap. Or, hey, wait a minute, maybe he wasn\u0027t wearin\u0027 no baseball cap. Maybe it was some other dude was wearin\u0027 a cap.\u0027 \" \"Maybe the third man gave them the gun.\" \"Hey, if it was his car, why shouldn\u0027t it be his gun, too?\" He laughed. \"I always more or less figured the gun was Ivanko\u0027s.\" \"Bierman didn\u0027t own one?\" \"Not that anybody knew, but would they? My guess is it came from a burglary. That\u0027s the way most crooks get guns, especially small-time skells like these two. Some concerned citizen buys one for his protection, and there\u0027s a burglary, and that\u0027s the last he sees of it. Unless he\u0027s home at the time, the sad bastard, in which case the last he sees is it\u0027s pointed at him, and the last he hears is bang.\" \"A little Italian twenty-two,\" Schering said. \"Pellegrino ten-shot automatic. I bet you thought they only made soda water.\" \"Diversification is everything.\" \"Isn\u0027t that the truth? Gun was registered to a psychiatrist at 242 Central Park West, reported stolen in a burglary back in March. Shrink and his wife were at the theater, came back to find the place tossed, some jewelry and valuables missing. Well, this is cute.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"In the list of what\u0027s missing- \u0027two white linen pillowcases.\u0027 That tell you anything?\" \"That the psychiatrist and his wife were lucky they didn\u0027t get home early.\" \"Sounds like Bierman and Ivanko, doesn\u0027t it? Pillowcases slung over their shoulders like they\u0027re on their way to do their laundry. Gun wasn\u0027t in the initial report.\" \"Oh?\" \"Reported everything else, the jewelry, the pillowcases. Three days later he called back about the gun. It took him that long to think of it and remember the locked desk drawer he kept it in, and guess what? The drawer wasn\u0027t locked anymore, and the gun wasn\u0027t in it. Why keep a gun under lock and key?\" \"For safety reasons, I guess.\" \"But why have it at all, if it\u0027s going to be that complicated to get to it? A locked drawer in his office.\" \"The office where he saw his patients?\" I heard him shuffling paper. \"It doesn\u0027t say,\" he reported, \"but it makes more sense that way, doesn\u0027t it? He\u0027s seeing patients all day long, and they\u0027re not coming to him to have their tonsils out. Some of them have got to be real nut jobs.\" \"That must be the technical term for it.\" \"He\u0027s got someone coming in that he\u0027s a little worried about, he takes out the key and unlocks the drawer. Any problem, he can get to the gun in a hurry.\" \"It must be comforting for the patient,\" I said, \"to have a shrink who can pull a gun on you if you start acting out.\" Schering laughed aloud. \"You\u0027re on the verge of this major breakthrough,\" he said. \"Really getting in touch with your anger, or remembering what really happened when your uncle came into your bedroom that night. And you look up from the couch, and there\u0027s Dr. Nadler, and he\u0027s pointing a gun at you.\" Dr. Nadler wouldn\u0027t talk to me, and I couldn\u0027t really blame him. Doctor-patient confidentiality aside, what did I expect him to tell me? That he\u0027d had Bierman or Ivanko as a patient, stretched out on his couch for an hour every Thursday, reliving childhood trauma and recounting dreams? That he knew who broke into his apartment and stole his gun, but hadn\u0027t seen fit to mention it to the police? I put the phone down and decided it was just as well he\u0027d brushed me off. If he\u0027d welcomed me warmly I\u0027d have had to think up some questions to ask him, and I wouldn\u0027t have known where to start. I kept finding things out, but what I learned was barely worth knowing. That\u0027s not an uncommon feeling in an investigation. You knock on a thousand doors and ask ten thousand questions, and the scraps of information you amass just pile up until something fits with something else. You learn to keep going, and you try not to listen when a little voice says the whole enterprise is pointless. But this time the voice was hard to ignore. I didn\u0027t see how I could keep working my way around the edges, picking at loose threads here and there. I knew what I had to do. I reached for the phone, then changed my mind and left it where it was. Rain, the forecast had said, and the skies looked dark enough. I went outside, headed uptown, and decided I should have taken an umbrella. It felt like rain, all right. Well, maybe it would clear the air. TWELVE The ground-floor antique shop looked to be open. The lights were on, the window gates drawn back. But I couldn\u0027t see anyone inside. The door was locked, and there was a button to push for entry. I pushed it, and after a moment a woman appeared at the rear of the shop and squinted at me, holding her hand to her brow as an eyeshade. She gave a little shrug, as if it didn\u0027t matter whether I was a customer or a holdup man, and buzzed me in. Her stock ran to small rural landscapes in elaborately gilded frames, French bronzes, mostly of animals, Royal Doulton figurines, Art Deco lamps. One shelf of an Ð¹tagÐ¸re was given over to cameos. She was a dumpling, her hair an unconvincing red, her cheeks heavily rouged, her billowy print dress flowing. Her smile was guarded, and something about her stance suggested she was keeping close to whatever device she could use to summon help.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-15.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
