I\u0027ll have a Long Island Iced Tea.\"\\n\\n They thought that one up after I stopped drinking, so I never learned what\u0027s in it, but I gather it contains a mix of liquors, and that tea\u0027s nowhere to be found. The name\u0027s ironic, and I suppose it\u0027s a reference to rum-running during Prohibition, which would make it doubly ironic, since the kids who get wasted on it can\u0027t even remember Vietnam.\\n\\n The drinks came. Andy sipped his and pronounced it a stupid drink. \"Who thought this up?\" he wondered. \"It\u0027s supposed to have a kick like a mule but it doesn\u0027t taste like anything at all. I suppose that\u0027s the point, especially if you\u0027re nineteen years old and looking to get your girlfriend drunk.\" He took another sip and said, \"It grows on you. I was going to say this is my first Long Island Iced Tea and it\u0027s going to be my last, but maybe not. Maybe I\u0027ll finish it and have six more of them.\"\\n\\n \"And maybe you won\u0027t,\" his brother said. \"Gray needs us back at the house.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what you call him? Gray?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s what Mom called him,\" Andy said. \"I never had much occasion to call him anything, really. Just if he answered the phone when I called, or the couple of times I visited.\"\\n\\n \"Which would have been four years ago,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Plus once since then.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"I guess it was last Thanksgiving. I never did come into the city, I just visited here for a couple of days and flew straight out again.\" He looked at his glass. \"I called you a few times,\" he said unconvincingly. \"I got the machine every time I called, and I didn\u0027t want to leave a message.\"\\n\\n I said, \"He seems like a nice enough fellow, Gray.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s all right,\" Andy said.\\n\\n \"He was good for Mom,\" Michael said. \"He was there for her, you know?\"\\n\\n Unlike some people. \"I never thought I\u0027d see this day,\" I said, surprising myself with the words, evidently surprising them as well from the looks on their faces. \"I always assumed I\u0027d go first,\" I explained. \"I didn\u0027t think about it much, but I guess I took it for granted. I was older by three years and change, and men generally die first. And all of a sudden she\u0027s gone.\"\\n\\n They didn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \"Everybody says that\u0027s the best way,\" I said. \"One minute you\u0027re here and the next minute you\u0027re gone. No pain to speak of, no long-drawn-out illness, no standing at the brink and staring out at the abyss. But it\u0027s not what I would want for myself.\"\\n\\n \"No?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I\u0027d want time to make sure I wasn\u0027t leaving a mess. My affairs in order, that sort of thing. And I\u0027d want time for other people to get used to the idea. A sudden death may be easier on the victim, but it\u0027s harder on everybody else.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" Michael said. \"June\u0027s got an aunt with Alzheimer\u0027s, she\u0027s been hanging on for years. Be a lot easier on all concerned if she stroked out or had a heart attack.\"\\n\\n I said he had a point. Andy said when it was his turn he wanted to be lowered into a vat of lanolin and softened to death. That seemed funny, but not funny enough to laugh at, given the mood at the table.\\n\\n \"Anyway,\" Michael said, \"we had a warning. Mom had a minor heart attack about a little over a year ago.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know that.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t hear about it right away. She and Gray didn\u0027t exactly call a press conference. But she had diabetes and high blood pressure, and- \"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know that, either.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t? I guess she developed diabetes about ten years ago. I don\u0027t know about the blood pressure, how long she had that. I believe you can have it a while without knowing it. The diabetes was mild enough so she didn\u0027t need injections, just oral insulin, but I guess it affects the heart, and so does the high blood pressure. She had the one heart attack, and it was just a question of time until she had another one, but I didn\u0027t expect it this soon.\"\\n\\n \"I thought she\u0027d beat it,\" Andy said. \"She seemed fine at Thanksgiving, and she and Gray were full of plans. There was this riverboat cruise through Germany they were going to take.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s next month,\" his brother said. \"They were going to leave right after Labor Day.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I guess that\u0027s out,\" Andy said. \"Maybe you can use their tickets, you and Elaine.\"\\n\\n There was an awkward silence, and then he said, \"Sorry, I don\u0027t know why I said that.\" He picked up his glass and looked at the ceiling light through it. I thought of all the times I\u0027d done that myself, though never with a glass of Long Island Iced Tea. \"This stuff ought to come with a warning label. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Forget it.\"\\n\\n \"Anyway, I don\u0027t suppose Elaine would want to go to Germany, would she?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Well, she\u0027s Jewish, isn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So she might not be that crazy about going to Germany. She might be worried about getting turned into soap.\"\\n\\n Michael said, \"Andy, why don\u0027t you shut up?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, it was just a joke, okay?\"\\n\\n \"A stupid joke.\"\\n\\n \"Nobody likes my jokes,\" Andy said. \"Soap, lanolin, I can\u0027t win. Nobody likes my jokes today.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a great day for jokes, bro.\"\\n\\n \"Just what is it a great day for, bro? Will you tell me that?\"\\n\\n \"I guess you guys\u0027ll want to get back to the house,\" I said, not knowing what they wanted to do, not caring much, knowing only that I wanted to get the hell out of there. \"Gray can probably use you for the next few hours.\"\\n\\n \"Gray,\" Andy said. \"You ever meet him?\"\\n\\n \"Just now, at the funeral.\"\\n\\n \"I figured you were old friends, calling him Gray and all.\"\\n\\n I turned to Michael. \"I think you\u0027d better drive,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Andy\u0027s all right.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever you say.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s upset, that\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"Talking about me like I\u0027m not here,\" Andy said. \"Can I ask a question? One fucking question?\" He didn\u0027t wait for permission. \"Where do you get off having the long face, talking about how you thought you\u0027d be the first to go? I mean, where in the hell does that come from? Who appointed you chief mourner, for God\u0027s sake?\"\\n\\n I could feel the anger, moving up my spine like an army. I kept a lid on it.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t give a shit about her while she was alive,\" he went on. \"Did you ever love her?\"\\n\\n \"I thought I did.\"\\n\\n \"But I guess it didn\u0027t last.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"The two of us weren\u0027t very good at being married.\"\\n\\n \"She wasn\u0027t so bad at it. You were the one who left.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure I wasn\u0027t the only one who thought of it. It\u0027s easier for a man to leave.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Past few years, I\u0027ve run into a few women who didn\u0027t find it so goddam hard. Pack a bag, walk out the door, easiest thing in the world.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not always as easy as it looks.\"\\n\\n \"Especially if there\u0027s kids involved,\" he said. \"Right?\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"I guess we didn\u0027t count, me and Mikey.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have anything to say to that. And the anger I\u0027d felt before was gone now, stuffed wherever that sort of thing gets stuffed. If I felt anything it was an almighty weariness. I wanted this little talk to be over and I knew it was going to go on forever.\\n\\n \"Why\u0027d you come, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"Because your brother called me up and told me about it,\" I said. \"Not Saturday, when he found out about it, and not Sunday when you both got here, but late last night.\" I turned to Michael. \"That was considerate,\" I said. \"That way I didn\u0027t have a long period of agonizing before the funeral.\"\\n\\n \"I just- \"\\n\\n \"In fact,\" I said, \"with any luck at all I\u0027d have made plans it would have been too late to cancel, and I wouldn\u0027t be here at all. Just your luck I\u0027m a guy who hasn\u0027t got too much to do these days.\"\\n\\n \"I was afraid to call,\" he said.\\n\\n \"What were you afraid of?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. How you\u0027d take it, what you\u0027d say. That you\u0027d come, that you wouldn\u0027t come. I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t not come,\" I said. \"I won\u0027t pretend I wanted to be here, but there\u0027s no way I could have stayed away. I had to be here for you two, even though you might have been happier if I\u0027d stayed in the city. And I had to be here for her.\" I took a breath. \"She was a good woman, your mother. I couldn\u0027t have stayed married to anyone, the kind of man I was. She did the best she could. Jesus, I guess we both did the best we could. That\u0027s what everybody does, the best they can, and that\u0027s all anybody does.\"\\n\\n Andy wiped away tears with his sleeve. He said, \"Dad, I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry as hell. I don\u0027t know what got into me.\"\\n\\n \"Six different kinds of booze,\" Michael said, \"all in one drink. What the hell did you expect?\"\\n\\n What did any of us expect?\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid you won\u0027t get to see any of them this time around,\" I told Elaine. \"Mike and June fly home tomorrow morning.\"\\n\\n \"What did June do, leave Melanie with her parents?\"\\n\\n \"They brought her along,\" I said, \"but I didn\u0027t get to see her. June thought the funeral would be too much for her, so she stayed at the house. I don\u0027t know whether they hired a sitter or some family member stayed with her.\"\\n\\n \"And you didn\u0027t get to see her at all?\"\\n\\n \"I could have, if I\u0027d wanted to go to the house, but I decided I\u0027d rather come straight home.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t blame you. What about Andy? He has to go straight home to Denver?\"\\n\\n \" Tucson.\"\\n\\n \" Tucson in the summer? It\u0027s like an oven.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I guess he figures he\u0027ll enjoy the winters. If he\u0027s still there.\"\\n\\n \"Your rolling stone.\"\\n\\n \"Not mine,\" I said. \"Not anymore. They\u0027re neither of them mine anymore, honey. I don\u0027t know if they ever were.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re saying that because of the kind of day you\u0027ve just had.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s only part of it. Oh, I\u0027m still their father, and they\u0027re still my sons. Otherwise we wouldn\u0027t get on one another\u0027s nerves the way we do. We\u0027ll get calls and cards at Christmas, and Andy may even keep us up to date on address changes. And they\u0027ll call if they happen to be in the city. Maybe not every time they come here, but some of the time. Of course they won\u0027t come to the city all that often.\"\\n\\n \"Baby- \"\\n\\n \"And when I drop dead,\" I said, \"they\u0027ll fly in for the funeral, and they\u0027ll show up wearing suits. They both look good in suits, I have to say that for them. They\u0027ll help carry the box, they got in practice for that this afternoon, although they\u0027ll have more weight to deal with next time.\"\\n\\n \"Unless you waste away,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you something,\" I said. \"You won\u0027t let me get away with a thing, will you?\"\\n\\n \"Would you love me more if I did?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see how I could. They\u0027ll be decent to you, incidentally. They were decent to Gray. That\u0027s what they call him, Gray.\"\\n\\n \"So you said.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I mentioned that? Gray. Big, good-looking fellow with one of those open, honest faces. Looked like he might have played football in school. Linebacker, maybe. Put on some weight since then but stayed in pretty good shape.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-6.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) \\n The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
