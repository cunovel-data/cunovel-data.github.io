Lia started to say she was fine with the tea, then changed her mind and ordered the spinach pie, the appetizer, though, not the full dinner. The waitress left and she picked up her teacup and looked at it and put it down again. \"It\u0027s ridiculous,\" I prompted. \"Oh. Well, it really is. I don\u0027t think I should even say it out loud.\" \"Because it\u0027s not fair even to think such things, and saying them is worse.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"On the other hand,\" I said, \"we came all the way uptown, and there\u0027s food coming, so we\u0027ll be here awhile. And we might as well talk about something.\" \"I wanted to call you- \" \"But you didn\u0027t,\" T J said, \"and even if you did, we probably would have come anyway.\" This surprised her. \"Why?\" \"To make sure it was what you really wanted,\" I said, \"and that nobody was holding a gun to your head.\" \"You think- \" \"I don\u0027t think anything. I\u0027d have come uptown to get some idea what to think. That\u0027s generally worth an hour and a couple of subway tokens. But it\u0027s beside the point, because you weren\u0027t able to call us and here we are, and we might as well cut to the chase. You think your cousin set up your aunt and uncle.\" \"But I don\u0027t think that. I told you- \" \"I know. You don\u0027t think it, but you did, even if you\u0027d like to pretend you didn\u0027t. It\u0027s just a thought, Lia. Best thing you can do with it is bring it out into the open.\" \"Otherwise it\u0027ll go bad,\" T J said. She took a breath and nodded and picked up her teacup, and this time she drank from it before setting it back in its saucer. \"She inherits everything,\" she said. \"Kristin.\" She nodded. \"That was the first thing I thought of. Not \u0027Poor Kristin, she\u0027s an orphan, she\u0027s alone in the world.\u0027 The first thing I thought was she\u0027s a rich girl now.\" \"How rich?\" \"I don\u0027t know. But even if all there is is the house, it\u0027s worth a fortune. A brownstone in the Seventies? There was one somebody was talking about the other day, West Eighty-fourth Street I think it was, and they were asking two-point-six. I don\u0027t know, maybe that\u0027s not a fortune anymore, maybe it\u0027s pocket change if you\u0027re one of the dot-com people, but it still seems like a lot of money to me.\" \"Could be mortgaged,\" I said. \"Uncle Byrne said it was free and clear. He was proud of that, how they\u0027d paid the house off years ago, and now it was worth so much money. He said how much better an investment it turned out to be than any of his stocks, so that means there must be stocks, too, don\u0027t you think?\" \"But not very good ones.\" \"Still, they\u0027d have to be worth something, wouldn\u0027t they?\" \"Sure.\" \"And I\u0027m sure there was insurance. And there were the things they owned, Aunt Susan\u0027s jewelry, the silverware, the paintings. They took the jewelry and silver, but it was recovered, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"I believe so.\" \"And what wasn\u0027t would be covered by insurance. Oh, God, what\u0027s the matter with me, sitting here adding up their assets in my head like, I don\u0027t know, a vulture or something. I mean, they\u0027re dead. What difference does the money make? It\u0027s not as if they got to keep it. They were murdered, they\u0027re dead.\" There was a silence, and it lasted awhile because the waitress turned up with the food. T J picked up a french fry and made a face at it, indicating it wasn\u0027t as well-done as he\u0027d hoped, but he didn\u0027t send anything back, or leave anything on his plate, so I guess it wasn\u0027t too bad. My cheeseburger tasted fine, and the coffee was better than the Morning Star\u0027s. Lia took one bite of her square of spinach pie and put her fork down. \"I envied her,\" she said abruptly. \"Kristin. That\u0027s what it was. I envied her when they were alive, having two wonderful parents who loved her and loved each other. My parents- no, forget it, I don\u0027t want to go there.\" \"All right.\" \"Uncle Byrne and Aunt Susan kept inviting me over for dinner. I begged off about half the time because I didn\u0027t want to take advantage. And I couldn\u0027t help feeling like a poor relation, which I was right to feel, really, because that\u0027s what I was. I\u0027m on scholarship, otherwise I couldn\u0027t afford Columbia in a million years, and even with a scholarship it\u0027s not easy.\" Her hands were busy as she talked, gesturing, touching her hair, brushing away imaginary crumbs. When her nails caught the light I saw she was wearing colorless nail polish on them. I decided she was painstaking enough to protect her nails but disinclined to embellish them. She wasn\u0027t wearing lipstick, and I wondered if she\u0027d used colorless lip gloss. Was there a pattern here, and what could I make of it? \"You envied Kristin,\" I prompted. \"When they were alive. And when I heard what happened, after the initial shock wore off, or maybe it hadn\u0027t worn off, not really- \" She paused for breath, looked away, then met my eyes. \"I thought, well, now she\u0027s rich. And I envied her all over again.\" \"And you figure that makes you a horrible person.\" \"I don\u0027t think it makes me a candidate for sainthood. Do you?\" \"I haven\u0027t met a lot of saints,\" I said, \"but then I\u0027ve lived a sheltered life. I don\u0027t think less of you for envying your cousin, before or after the murder, and I certainly don\u0027t think less of you for owning up to it. But what I think of you isn\u0027t very important, either. How do you feel?\" \"How do I feel?\" \"Right now.\" She frowned, thinking about it. \"I feel okay,\" she said, surprised. \"Good. How\u0027d you get from envy to suspicion?\" \"From envy to- oh, right. Suspicion\u0027s an overstatement, really. I wouldn\u0027t call it suspicion.\" \"We\u0027ll find something else to call it. How\u0027d you get there?\" \"The burglar alarm,\" she said. \"They had a burglar alarm?\" \"And it didn\u0027t go off.\" \"Maybe they forgot to set it.\" \"That\u0027s what it said in the papers, that they owned a burglar alarm but neglected to set it that night. But they always set it. They had a break-in the first year they owned the house, someone came in through a window and took some cash and a portable TV, and after that they got the alarm system. It was connected to the front door and to all the windows on the first floor, and the store downstairs from them had its own alarm system, and that was set, too.\" \"Maybe they just set it most of the time.\" She was shaking her head. \"Both of them, Aunt Susan and Uncle Byrne, they would set it before they went down to the corner to mail a letter. It was automatic. On their way out they would key in the number to set it, and the minute they walked in the door they keyed it in again to turn it off. They\u0027d been doing it for twenty years. They wouldn\u0027t suddenly quit and get robbed the same night.\" \"If the keypad was by the front door- \" \"It wasn\u0027t. It was inside the coat closet.\" \"That\u0027s better,\" I said, \"but it\u0027s still the first place a burglar would look.\" \"Why would he look anywhere?\" T J wondered, and answered his own question. \"The metal tape on the windows. Tip \u0027em off in a heartbeat.\" \"Tape on a window doesn\u0027t mean there\u0027s an alarm system, or that it\u0027s set,\" I said. \"But if I was breaking into a house it would be enough to make me take a quick look around. I might do that even if I didn\u0027t see tape on the windows. Especially if I spent a little time checking the place out first, in which case I might have known about the alarm system before I got anywhere near the front door.\" Lia said, \"But they\u0027d need more than that, wouldn\u0027t they? There\u0027s a four-digit number you have to enter in order to deactivate the alarm.\" \"There are other ways,\" I said, \"if you happen to know them. You can rewire the system and bypass the alarm. But that would show up later on. What was the number, do you happen to know?\" \"Ten-seventeen,\" she said. \"One-oh-one-seven. It was their wedding anniversary, they got married on the seventeenth of October. I forget the year.\" \"Well, you wouldn\u0027t need to know the year to deactivate the alarm.\" \"No,\" she said, and her eyes widened. \"You don\u0027t think…\" \"That you were the set-up person? Why, were you?\" \"Of course not!\" \"Good, we can cross you off the list. And you can relax, because you were never on it. How\u0027d you happen to know the number?\" \"Aunt Susan told me.\" \"So you would feel like a real member of the family?\" Her eyes welled up, making her look that much more waiflike. \"We went shopping,\" she said, \"and she had her arms full of packages when we came home. She had me get the key from her purse and unlock the door, and then she told me to key in the number so we wouldn\u0027t have sirens going off.\" \"You knew where the keypad was.\" \"Of course. I\u0027d seen them use it to activate the system, and to deactivate it.\" \"And she told you the number?\" \"I couldn\u0027t just press buttons at random, could I? She told me the number, and later on she explained the significance, that it was their anniversary.\" \"And that helped you remember it.\" \"Actually, it was the other way around. I\u0027d never known the date of their anniversary, but the number stuck in my mind, and that\u0027s how come I know when their anniversary was.\" \"She didn\u0027t mind letting you know the number.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t think she thought I was likely to rob the place.\" \"No, of course not. But they had that alarm system for how long, twenty years? Something like that? And the odds are they picked that number early on, and never changed it. As a matter of fact, it\u0027s probably not the only thing they used it for. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it turns out to be the PIN number for their bank accounts and credit cards. People aren\u0027t supposed to do it that way, it\u0027s a bad idea from a security standpoint, but life\u0027s a lot easier when you\u0027ve only got one number to remember.\" \"I use… well, the same number for everything.\" \"And it\u0027s probably either your birthday or the last four digits of your Social Security number.\" It was one or the other, from her reaction, but at least she didn\u0027t tell me which one. \"It\u0027s my AOL password, too. I guess I\u0027d better change it.\" \"As far as your aunt and uncle\u0027s alarm system was concerned,\" I said, \"anybody could have let that slip. A burglar is as good as his research, and the smart ones learn to use people who don\u0027t even know they\u0027re being used. Repairmen, delivery boys. Maybe they had someone doing work in their house, building bookshelves or rewiring the top floor, and he needed to be able to get in and out in their absence. They knew they could trust him.\" \"And he never told anybody,\" T J said, picking it up smoothly. \"Only he mentioned to his wife that these people were so sentimental they used their wedding anniversary to get in and out of their house. And she told her son, so he\u0027d know that it wouldn\u0027t be a good idea to forget his parents\u0027 wedding anniversary, and then the kid got into drugs and wound up on Rikers Island, and somebody brought up the subject of burglar alarms, and he knew these people who used their wedding anniversary as a password. If the right person heard it, all he\u0027d need to do was find out when those people got married, and how hard would it be to get that information?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-9.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
