{"id":64665,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"\"Yes.\" He got to his feet, put his hands together, rocked back on his heels. \"Peter,\" he said, \"when two people relate in a certain way, when there\u0027s a particular magic that they create between themselves, it\u0027s really a rather remarkable thing.\" \"I know.\" \"I always sensed that magic with you and Kristin.\" \"So did I, but…\" \"But you separated. You went to Williamsburg and she returned to her parents\u0027 house.\" \"Right.\" \"And that was inevitable. You were committed to the others, to Marsha and Lucian and Kieran and Ruth Ann.\" \"And to you, don\u0027t forget.\" \"Well,\" he says. His smile is gentle, self-effacing. \"To me insofar as I embody in your mind your own best interests. You and the others shared a goal, and what we determined together was that Kristin did not share that goal.\" \"Not the way everybody else did.\" \"The five of you,\" he says, \"are a family, Peter.\" \"Yes, we are.\" \"The house is perfect for you. You have a floor, Marsha and Lucian have a floor, Ruth Ann and Kieran have a floor. But you work together, you create this space together.\" \"Yes.\" \"As a family.\" Family is the magic word; delivered with the right cadence, it can bring Peter almost to tears. \"Kristin had a family of her own,\" he says, \"and she was not ready to change one nest for another. You made the right decision, Peter.\" \"I know.\" \"And she made the right decision, too.\" \"I know that now. I wasn\u0027t sure at first, but now I know you\u0027re right.\" \"But her situation has changed.\" \"Because- \" \"Because she lost her family.\" \"It was a terrible thing.\" What a way with words the fellow has! \"A terrible thing,\" he echoes. \"What do we get in life, Peter?\" \"What do we get?\" \"You know the answer, Peter.\" \"We get what we get.\" \"Exactly. We get what we get, and what we do with it makes it good fortune or bad. You and Kristin belong together.\" \"That\u0027s what I always thought.\" Thought, he notes, rather than think. What\u0027s this? \"I think you should call her,\" he says, pressing. \"I think you should visit her, I think you should be with her in her hour of need.\" Did he really say that? No matter. \"You have broad shoulders, Peter, and that\u0027s what she needs right now, even as she needs once again to be part of a family.\" \"But- \" He waits. His hand goes to his throat, and his fingers find the rhodochrosite disc. He strokes it, feels its cool smoothness. \"There\u0027s this woman I sort of met, she\u0027s a sculptor? She lives on Wythe Avenue in Northside Williamsburg? She\u0027s really nice, and her values are the same as mine, as ours, and, and I thought maybe…\" The words trail off. He touches the pink stone disc again, thinks: Clarity. He waits a beat, then says, \"Rebound.\" \"Pardon?\" He\u0027s on his feet, pacing, spins around to face Peter Meredith. He says, \"Rebound, Peter! You\u0027re on the rebound! That\u0027s all this is.\" \"You really think so?\" \"I know so. Stand up. Up! Yes. Face me, yes. Now close your eyes. Now hold out both your hands, palms up. All right. Are you ready?\" \"Uh, I guess.\" \"Put your feelings for Kristin in your right hand. Feel the weight, the substance. Do you feel it?\" \"Yes.\" \"Now put whatever it is you feel for this sculptor in your other hand. There! Do you feel the difference?\" \"Yes.\" \"Open your eyes, Peter. Which hand is heavier?\" \"This one.\" \"The body doesn\u0027t lie. It feels the weight of one, the lack of substance of the other. Tell me, then. Where is your destiny?\" \"With Kristin?\" \"Are you asking me or telling me?\" \"It\u0027s with Kristin.\" \"What\u0027s with Kristin?\" \"My destiny.\" He goes to him, embraces him. \"Peter,\" he says, \"I\u0027m so proud of you. Do you know how proud I am?\" When the door closes he turns the bolt, sighs deeply. He could have killed Peter Meredith, could have reached out and killed him. A sculptor, playing with fucking clay in a Wythe Avenue shithole, someone to share his fucking values. You have to lead these people every step of the way. Every step of the way! THIRTY-ONE \"What\u0027d be nice,\" Ira Wentworth said, \"is a shred of evidence. Something I could take to a judge and come back with a warrant.\" \"You want everything handed to you,\" I said. \"That\u0027s me,\" he said. \"Give me the easy ones every time. I remember when my father taught me to play pool. \u0027Son,\u0027 he said, \u0027always pocket the easy balls. Leave the bank shots and combinations for the boys with rich fathers.\u0027 \" \"Sound advice.\" \"Yeah,\" he said, \"but I didn\u0027t hear it from my old man, who as far as I know never picked up a pool cue in his life. I heard it from a guy I was playing pool with, right after I missed this three-ball combination.\" He shook his head ruefully. \"It was so pretty I couldn\u0027t resist it.\" \"And you never got over it,\" I said. \"Never,\" he said, getting to his feet, \"but I\u0027m still young. There\u0027s hope. I\u0027m going to start digging, see what I can find on this shrink. Maybe we\u0027ll get lucky and there\u0027ll be a sheet on him. Maybe I\u0027ll ask him where he was yesterday and he\u0027ll turn beet-red and blurt out a confession.\" We shook hands all around, and he walked off, heading uptown. \"He\u0027s pretty good,\" I told T J. He didn\u0027t say anything. I turned and saw him gazing across the street, holding up a hand to shade his eyes against the afternoon sun. \"Thought I saw somebody,\" he said, \"but it ain\u0027t him.\" \"Nadler?\" \"Ain\u0027t never seen him, so how would I know?\" \"Then how do you know it\u0027s not him?\" \"Huh?\" \"Never mind,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going home. What about you?\" \"Guess I\u0027ll go up around Columbia,\" he said. \"Hear what they sayin\u0027 \u0027bout Lia.\" I took my time walking home, trying to think of something useful I could do, and when I got there Elaine told me I was just in time. \"To go to the movies,\" she said. \"I got bored and closed early. I decided I wanted to go to a movie in the middle of a weekday afternoon. It\u0027s the most decadent thing I can think of.\" \"What a sheltered life you\u0027ve led.\" \"That\u0027s it exactly,\" she said. \"Wanna keep me company, big boy?\" \"What do you want to see?\" \"There\u0027s an Adam Sandler movie at Worldwide Cinema.\" \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding,\" I said. \"C\u0027mon, it\u0027ll be fun. And it\u0027s only three dollars. That\u0027s our reward for missing it the first time around.\" \"Missing it was its own reward,\" I said. She looked at her watch. \"We\u0027ve got seventeen minutes. Do you think we can get to Fiftieth and Eighth in seventeen minutes?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"I\u0027m afraid we can.\" When we got home there was a message from Kristin. Could I call her? I called, and when the machine invited me to leave a message I identified myself and said I was returning her call. \"Please pick up if you\u0027re there,\" I said. \"Otherwise call me back when you get this message. I should be home the rest of- \" The evening, I would have concluded, but she picked up and said, \"Mr. Scudder? Sorry, I was in the other room. The reason I called, well, I suppose I shouldn\u0027t have bothered you…\" \"What is it, Kristin?\" \"Well, I had a call earlier. From Peter.\" \"Peter Meredith?\" \"Yes, that\u0027s right. I was standing right next to the machine when the call came in, and I thought, really, what\u0027s so terrible about picking it up?\" \"And did you pick it up?\" \"No, because you said not to.\" \"Good.\" \"But I felt really strange about it, you know? I mean, there have been all these calls from people I don\u0027t know, like newspaper reporters, and I just delete the message and that\u0027s that. I don\u0027t give it a second thought.\" \"There\u0027s no reason why you should. They\u0027ll keep pestering you, but they\u0027ll pester you less if you don\u0027t give them any encouragement.\" \"I know that. But Peter\u0027s different.\" She paused for breath, then said, \"He wants me to call him back.\" \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea.\" \"Why?\" I gave her an answer, but it might have sounded more convincing if I\u0027d had a reason. I just didn\u0027t want her talking to him, and I couldn\u0027t explain why. It\u0027s not as though I thought Nadler could morph into a handful of electrical impulses and shoot through the phone lines at her, but I still didn\u0027t want her on the phone with an old boyfriend or anyone else. \"Well,\" she said at length, and I didn\u0027t know what it meant. Ultimately, of course, it was up to her. Unless I had her phones ripped out, I couldn\u0027t stop her from taking whatever calls she chose to take. \"That policeman was here,\" she said. \"Officer Wentworth?\" \"Detective Wentworth.\" \"Oh, is that a faux pas, calling him officer if he\u0027s a detective? Not that I did, I don\u0027t think I called him anything. He\u0027s nice.\" \"He\u0027s a good man,\" I said. \"He said he would assign some police officers to watch the house, but that I wouldn\u0027t even know that they\u0027re there. So of course I keep going to the window and peeking out from behind the curtain, and I can\u0027t see anybody, but then he said I wouldn\u0027t be able to. So maybe they\u0027re there and maybe they\u0027re not.\" \"You\u0027ll be fine.\" \"I guess I\u0027m not expected to give them milk and cookies,\" she said, \"so I don\u0027t suppose it matters if they\u0027re there or not. I mean if I know if they\u0027re there or not.\" \"I know what you mean.\" \"Thank you. It\u0027s a little weird being cooped up like this. I wanted to order a pizza, but I didn\u0027t know if I should, because you said not to open the door. Is it okay to open the door for a pizza delivery boy?\" I was beginning to understand what a pain in the ass it must be to guard somebody in the Witness Protection Program. While I was thinking up an answer she said, \"Never mind, there\u0027s plenty of stuff in the house. I must be driving you crazy. Am I? Tell me if I am.\" \"No, of course not. I know it\u0027s tough for you.\" \"It\u0027s just being cooped up with nothing to do but listen to my own head. Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you!\" \"What?\" \"I almost forgot. Remember I was supposed to see if there was anything missing? Anything taken in the burglary and not returned?\" \"And is there?\" \"I think so,\" she said, \"but I don\u0027t know if it means anything. I mean, it\u0027s not valuable or anything. So if it is missing, that doesn\u0027t mean anybody took it. It could just be lost.\" \"What is it, Kristin?\" \"Do you know what rhodochrosite is?\" \"A gemstone?\" \"Well, I guess they call it semiprecious. Or maybe not even that. It\u0027s sort of a rosy pink, but… you know what? Why don\u0027t you come over here and I\u0027ll show you?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-37.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
