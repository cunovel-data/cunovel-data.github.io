{"id":64641,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"You just said a true fact,\" he said. \"It all evens out.\"\\n\\n We talked some more as I walked around the apartment, getting the feel of the place, trying to imagine how it had all played out. Two men walk in the door, laden down with what they\u0027ve stolen. They\u0027ve just raped a woman, killed her and her husband, and they feel- how do they feel? How could I possibly guess how they felt?\\n\\n They walk in, and moments later (or hours later, I didn\u0027t know the time frame here) one of them shoots the other. Then strips to his undershorts (unless he stripped first, before he shot his partner) and sits in the corner and eats his gun. Or, in Iverson\u0027s memorable imagery, fellates it.\\n\\n I asked if they\u0027d both lived here.\\n\\n \"Place was Bierman\u0027s,\" he said. \"Signed a lease back in April, and, far as any of the neighbors knew, he lived here by himself. Clothes in the closet were his. Just one pillow on the mattress, and even if two people share a bed, wouldn\u0027t each one have his own pillow?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d think so.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe he brought Ivanko back so they could stash the loot, divvy it up, whatever they were going to do.\" He shrugged. \"Maybe Bierman was queer for him, made a move and Ivanko didn\u0027t go for it. Bang bang, you\u0027re dead, bang again and I\u0027m dead. If one of \u0027em lived through it we could ask, but they\u0027re both dead and we can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"You had to kick the door in,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Once again, if they were alive they could have opened it for us. But yes, we had to kick it in. Not me personally but the two uniforms who got here first. They must have known what they were gonna find. Nobody\u0027s on the job any length of time without getting a whiff of eau de corpse, and for the rest of your life you never mistake it for anything else, do you?\"\\n\\n \"Was the super here when they got here?\"\\n\\n \"Jorge? He was the one who called them. A neighbor complained and he went and called 911.\"\\n\\n \"He just let us in,\" I said. \"Why couldn\u0027t he let the uniforms in?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I wondered where the hell you were going. The door was bolted from the inside.\"\\n\\n \"And the key wouldn\u0027t turn the deadbolt?\"\\n\\n \"Not that kind of a bolt,\" he said. \"This had nothing to do with the lock. It was the kind of gizmo you buy in the hardware store and screw onto the back of your door, half of it, and the other half onto the jamb. And you slide the bolt over and lock the door. Here, you can see the holes where the screws were. One more thing for Jorge to spackle before he starts painting, if he even takes the trouble. I saw the bolt itself when I came in, nice shiny brass thing. The door itself was intact, kicking didn\u0027t damage it, the inside bolt just pulled loose from where it was attached. Didn\u0027t the bolt show in any of the photos Schering showed you?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I didn\u0027t have a complete set.\" I walked around some more, looked out the bedroom window at the lot in back. There were four garbage cans out there, three upright and one on its side, with trash spilling out of it. There was a black Hefty bag alongside it, and it looked to have been gnawed open by a rat. The rat wasn\u0027t there to be seen, but I saw what might have been rat shit. The boys from Forensics could have identified it as such, and told me what the rat had for breakfast.\\n\\n You could grow flowers back there, I thought, or cook on a barbecue grill, but you\u0027d have to be out of your mind to want to.\\n\\n \"I wish I knew why he took his clothes off,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Bierman?\"\\n\\n \"Was Ivanko undressed too?\"\\n\\n \"No, just Bierman. It was warm, and you may have noticed that one of the things this place lacks is an air conditioner, or even a fan. They probably worked up a sweat, toting all that shit back from Manhattan. Bierman was wearing jeans and a long-sleeved shirt. He may have figured he\u0027d be cooler without \u0027em.\"\\n\\n \"I guess.\"\\n\\n \"And maybe he just didn\u0027t like wearing clothes with blood on them.\"\\n\\n \"There was blood on his clothing?\"\\n\\n \"Pants and shirt both.\"\\n\\n \"Ivanko\u0027s blood?\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"From the Hollander killing. Hers, I guess, but that\u0027d be in the report. She got her throat cut, she\u0027s the one whose blood\u0027d get on everything.\"\\n\\n \"Wasn\u0027t it Ivanko who cut her throat?\"\\n\\n \"Did they decide for sure one way or the other? Does it matter? They both had blood on their clothes. You cut a throat, one thing there\u0027s plenty of is blood. Everybody can have some.\"\\n\\n I said, \"I wonder why they locked themselves in.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027d just killed two people and brought home a couple of sacks full of stolen goods. Maybe they didn\u0027t want anybody to walk in on them just then.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\"\\n\\n \"Or Bierman shot his buddy and wanted a few minutes of guaranteed peace and quiet before he went and joined him. But that\u0027s beside the point, isn\u0027t it? What you want to know is were they locked in, and they were, and from the inside.\"\\n\\n Iverson had things to do, and he made sure the apartment was locked up again before he went off to do them. I don\u0027t know what he thought I could find to steal.\\n\\n When he was gone I went down to the basement for a few words with Jorge, then went through the rest of the building looking for someone else to talk to. Half the tenants were out and most of the others either couldn\u0027t speak English or preferred to give that impression. I didn\u0027t learn anything, and I wasn\u0027t sure there was anything to learn.\\n\\n I walked up to Avenue M, turned left, and realized when I got to the corner that I could have cut diagonally across Locust and saved myself some steps.\\n\\n I had to laugh. If I\u0027d wanted to save time, I could have skipped Brooklyn altogether. I walked a few more blocks, climbed the steps to the platform, and waited for my train.\\n\\n NINE\\n\\n He gets in the car and starts driving, with no destination in mind. He just feels like a drive, that\u0027s all.\\n\\n And the car\u0027s so clean it\u0027s a pleasure to be in it. He\u0027s a neat person, he keeps his car neat, inside and out, and frequently runs it through a car wash. But he just recently had it detailed for the first time, and when he got into it he\u0027d have sworn it was fresh from the dealer\u0027s showroom. It even smelled like a new car, and he\u0027s since learned how they managed that. There\u0027s this product, comes in a spray can, called New Car Smell.\\n\\n They think of everything.\\n\\n He\u0027s not paying attention to the route, because if you don\u0027t know where you\u0027re going, what does it matter how you get there? On Canal Street he sees the signs for the Manhattan Bridge, and he crosses into Brooklyn and drives south on Flatbush Avenue, and now he knows where he\u0027s headed.\\n\\n If you just wait, he thinks, you find out where you\u0027re going.\\n\\n And you get what you get.\\n\\n And isn\u0027t it traditional, returning to the scene of the crime? And he\u0027s done it before. Twice, since that evening, he\u0027s found himself walking across that block of West Seventy-fourth Street. He\u0027s slowed as he passed the house, but hasn\u0027t wanted to linger, hasn\u0027t cared to invite a second glance. Still, people will stare at the house for perfectly innocent reasons, won\u0027t they? With all the news, all the media coverage, the house has become a notorious site. It hasn\u0027t reached the point of tour buses cruising by, the drivers rattling off the gory details over their loudspeaker systems, and it wouldn\u0027t come to that, not in this city where there was always a fresh outrage to erase the memory of the last one.\\n\\n Still, why tempt fate? On his second walk past the house, he\u0027d been tempted to browse the ground-floor antique shop, maybe buy something for a souvenir. And what could be more innocent than to patronize a retail establishment? But no, he let it go.\\n\\n He keeps one hand on the wheel, reaches to his throat with the other. Puts a finger inside his shirt collar, touches the thin gold chain around his neck.\\n\\n The best souvenirs, he thinks, are ones you don\u0027t have to buy.\\n\\n He turns right off Flatbush onto Cortelyou Road, turns left again on Coney Island Avenue. He drives to the house where it happened, and coasts right on by when he notices a police cruiser parked illegally two doors away. There\u0027s no one in it, and there could be any number of reasons to park a police car beside a hydrant on that particular block. There are a good many homes and apartment houses within walking distance, and a cop might have cause to visit any of them. There didn\u0027t even have to be a crime involved, or a complaint. He could just be visiting a girlfriend, or a favorite uncle.\\n\\n He circles the block, parks legally a few doors down the street where he can watch the house. He\u0027s got his eye on it when the door opens and two men come out, the younger one looking Brooklyn-debonair in a boisterous Hawaiian shirt and dark trousers, the other older and more conservative in his dress. The two men shake hands, and then the younger man- and yes, he looks like a cop on vacation, a cop on his day off- gets into the police car and pulls away from the curb. The older man watches him go and heads back into the house.\\n\\n The landlord, making sure he can rent out the apartment again without destroying evidence? Some city employee, some political functionary?\\n\\n Or maybe the next tenant, concerned about building security. Except he looks wrong for the neighborhood.\\n\\n The landlord, he decides. But it doesn\u0027t concern him, not really. He doesn\u0027t live here, and there\u0027s really no reason why he ever has to return to this neighborhood.\\n\\n It\u0027s not like Seventy-fourth Street, where he has ongoing interests to consider.\\n\\n TEN\\n\\n Over the next several days I talked to ten or a dozen people, some on the phone, some face to face. I didn\u0027t have a client, or any real reason to be running an investigation, but I couldn\u0027t have been busier if I had.\\n\\n I called a few lawyers I knew, including Ray Gruliow and Drew Kaplan, on the chance that somebody might know something interesting about Byrne Hollander. Ray had met a junior partner of his once, a fellow named Sylvan Harding, but remembered him chiefly because of his name. \"Only man I ever met named Sylvan,\" he said, \"and it was a constant struggle to keep from calling him Mr. Fields, because I absolutely could not get the phrase \u0027Sylvan Fields\u0027 out of my head. And still can\u0027t evidently. I\u0027m not sure he\u0027d even remember who I am.\"\\n\\n \"When did anyone ever forget Hard-Way Ray?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027ve got a point. If you want, I can call him and tell him to expect to hear from you. But I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027ll smooth the way for you or just get him to keep his guard up.\"\\n\\n \"Just so it gets me past the reception desk,\" I said.\\n\\n He made the call, and it got me past reception and all the way into Sylvan Harding\u0027s office. The first thing he did was apologize for the view. \"If you\u0027re in the Empire State Building,\" he said, \"you ought to be able to see three or four states, wouldn\u0027t you think? But we\u0027re on the seventh floor, and for all the view we\u0027ve got we might as well be in the basement.\" He smiled in the right places as he told me this, and it had a very pat feel to it; I had the feeling every visitor got to hear the same little speech.\\n\\n I was on a fishing expedition, looking for anyone who might have had something against the late Byrne Hollander, and I didn\u0027t get a lot from Harding. He couldn\u0027t come up with a single disappointed client or disgruntled employee, and seemed puzzled by the notion that anyone anywhere could actually harbor ill feeling toward a member of the legal profession.\\n\\n I learned that Hollander had specialized in estate and trust work, which made it even less likely that a resentful client had sent Bierman and Ivanko to his door. In his line of work, his clients were dead and gone before any failings on his part became evident. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-13.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) \\n The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
