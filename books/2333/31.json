{"id":64659,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"If that had been one of Danny\u0027s nights at Poogan\u0027s, I might never have met Helen Leich Bierman Watling, the twice-widowed mother of Jason Bierman. I\u0027d have thought of calling her at her hotel, and I might have looked at my watch and decided it was too late for a phone call. If I\u0027d failed to find a working pay phone, intending to call when I got home, I\u0027d have been that much more likely to decide it was too late and let it go until morning.\\n\\n By then I\u0027d have heard from Ira Wentworth (of Wentworth \u0026 McLaren) and a call to a dotty old lady from Wisconsin would no longer have ranked high on my list of priorities. In any event, I\u0027d have had to call her by nine that morning, because that was when she was leaving to catch an eleven-A.M. flight to Milwaukee, the airport of choice for those living in Oconomowoc.\\n\\n But Mother Blue\u0027s is on Amsterdam in the Nineties, just a few minutes from the Colonial Inn, late the Paraldehyde Arms. I didn\u0027t even call, I just walked there, and a clerk who looked too well-scrubbed for the rest of the lobby confirmed that Mrs. Watling was a guest of the hotel. I picked up a house phone and he put through a call to her room.\\n\\n I said, \"Mrs. Watling, my name\u0027s Matthew Scudder, I\u0027m a private detective. I\u0027d like to talk with you about your son.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, my,\" she said. \"You people really come out of the woodwork, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\\n\\n \"I guess you smell money,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry to disappoint you, but I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t possibly afford the fees you charge.\"\\n\\n And she rang off.\\n\\n \"I think we got cut off,\" I told the clerk. \"Could you put me through again?\"\\n\\n When she picked up I said, \"Mrs. Watling, you couldn\u0027t hire me if you wanted to. I already have a client, and I happen to believe your son is in fact innocent, that he was set up and killed by a man as yet unidentified. I\u0027m downstairs in the lobby, I walked over here to talk to you, but if you hang up on me again I\u0027ll go home, and you can go to hell.\"\\n\\n I said all that in one breath, wanting to get the words in before she broke the connection, and maybe that\u0027s why my finish was a little more forceful than I\u0027d intended. For a moment I thought she had in fact hung up, because I didn\u0027t hear anything from her, and then she said, \"Oh, dear. I finally act in an assertive manner, after being so namby-pamby ever since I got to this city, and I guess I picked the wrong man to hang up on. Are you still there?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here.\"\\n\\n \"Do you want to come up here?\"\\n\\n NO VISITORS ALLOWED IN ROOMS, a sign announced. \"I don\u0027t think I can,\" I said. \"There seems to be a rule against it.\"\\n\\n \"Do you suppose they think I\u0027m a prostitute? Well, it doesn\u0027t matter, there\u0027s no room for two people in here anyway. There\u0027s not really room for one. This is the worst excuse for a hotel I\u0027ve ever seen in my whole life, let alone stayed in, and they\u0027re charging me ninety-five dollars a night, and tax is extra. And people tell me it\u0027s a bargain!\"\\n\\n Welcome to New York, I thought.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have to get dressed,\" she said, \"but it won\u0027t take me a minute, and then I\u0027ll be right down.\"\\n\\n It was more than a minute, but no more than five, before she emerged from the elevator, wearing a beige pantsuit and a bright yellow blouse. \"I\u0027m dressed all wrong for New York,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t have to tell me.\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t going to.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I am, and I know it, but I\u0027m not going to run out and buy a lot of black clothes just so I can fit in. And I don\u0027t think I would fit in even if I did.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t inclined to argue the point. She looked like a suburban Midwestern matron, her light brown hair carefully styled, her lipstick neatly applied, her wrinkles the kind they call laugh lines. She wasn\u0027t the stereotypical mother I\u0027d envisioned, but she seemed to fit the role she\u0027d fashioned for herself, or found forced upon her- the mother determined to salvage a dead son\u0027s good name.\\n\\n Except it wasn\u0027t all that good a name to start with, she told me, after we had settled into a corner booth at the Ninety-sixth Street equivalent of the Morning Star, or the Salonika. \"Nothing ever really worked out for Jason,\" she said. \"His father was about the handsomest boy in our high school class, and the most fun. But fun was all he cared about, and fun meant drinking, and drinking meant… well, he took off when Jason was four years old. I never heard from him, and I was told I could divorce him in absentia, or have him declared legally dead after seven years. But I didn\u0027t know that I wanted to do that, either of those things, and then I didn\u0027t have to, because he turned a car over somewhere in California and there was a card in his wallet of who to notify in the event he died, which he did.\"\\n\\n Jason didn\u0027t do well in school, she said, and then when she remarried he didn\u0027t get along with his stepfather, who was, she had to admit it, a hard man to get along with. And Jason sort of drifted, and he wasn\u0027t too good at staying out of trouble, but he was never what you\u0027d call bad. There was nothing hurtful about him, nothing mean-spirited. They said he\u0027d been arrested for sneaking under a subway turnstile, and she could imagine him doing that, or even shoplifting from a supermarket or department store, but what they\u0027d said he\u0027d done…\\n\\n I told her how I was investigating from the other direction, trying to find someone with a motive specific to the Hollanders. If I could find some common element, someone in her son\u0027s life who was in any way linked to Byrne and Susan Hollander, then I might be able to connect the dots.\\n\\n She thought it over while she spread butter on her toasted bran muffin (\"one thing that\u0027s definitely better in New York, I\u0027ll grant you that\") and took a little bite. She sipped some iced tea, ate more of the muffin, drank more of the tea, and looked up at me and shook her head.\\n\\n \"I just don\u0027t know who he did or didn\u0027t know,\" she said. \"He would call me just about once a week, he was good about that. He called collect, of course. I told him to, he didn\u0027t have the money to pay for his calls. In fact I helped him out a little, I sent a money order every few weeks. I didn\u0027t send checks because it was almost impossible for him to find a place that would cash a personal check on an out-of-state bank, and of course he didn\u0027t have a bank account of his own to deposit it into. He didn\u0027t have anything.\"\\n\\n Except, she said, he was beginning to find himself, to get his feet planted. Not to take charge of his life, that made him sound a little more capable than he had yet become, but at least to play an active role in his own life instead of watching passively as it unfolded before him.\\n\\n \"He was working,\" she said. \"Three hours a day, Monday through Friday, delivering lunches for a delicatessen. They paid him in cash at the end of his shift each day, and it wasn\u0027t very much, but he got tips, too. And he worked nights, too, making deliveries for a package store.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know the term, and she said, \"Don\u0027t you call it that? A store that sells packaged goods. Beverages, alcoholic beverages. What do you call it?\"\\n\\n \"A liquor store.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s New York for you,\" she said. \"I guess we\u0027re more discreet in the Midwest, or maybe just more namby-pamby. We call them package stores. Now you didn\u0027t know that, and I didn\u0027t know there was anything else to call them, so I guess we both learned something, didn\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n Jason\u0027s life didn\u0027t sound like much, she knew. A couple of part-time subsistence jobs hardly amounted to a budding career. But when you knew him and where he\u0027d come from, well, you could see that he was on the right track.\\n\\n \"The last time he got in trouble,\" she said, \"they had him see a counselor, and I have to give New York credit for this, because Jason said the man helped him see things a little more clearly. How he was just getting in his own way time and time again, and how it didn\u0027t have to be that way. And from that point on, his life began to improve.\"\\n\\n Some specifics might have helped. The name of the social worker, for instance, who might have known the names of some of the other people in Jason Bierman\u0027s new life. It would have been nice to know the names and locations of his occasional employers; she knew only that the deli was in Manhattan, which didn\u0027t narrow it down much. The package store (\"or liquor store, I\u0027ll have to remember to call it that\") might have been anywhere.\\n\\n She finished her bran muffin and iced tea, and I decided I\u0027d had as much of my coffee as I wanted. I picked up the check, and she took a wallet from her purse and asked how much her share came to. I said it was on me. She insisted she\u0027d be happy to pay, and I told her to forget it. \"You\u0027re a visitor,\" I said. \"Next time I\u0027m in Wisconsin, I\u0027ll let you pick up the tab.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s very nice of you,\" she said. \"And after I just about accused you of trying to drum up some high-priced business!\" But she\u0027d had audiences with several private detectives, she said, and one told her to go home, that she was wasting her time, and the others wanted substantial advances before they would undertake to do a thing.\\n\\n \"Two men asked for two thousand dollars, and one wanted twenty-five hundred,\" she said. \"And there was another man who asked for two or three thousand, I can\u0027t remember which, and I said that was much too high, and he said, well, how about a thousand? And I hemmed and hawed, and he said if I gave him five hundred he could get started. And it came to me that he wanted whatever I could give him, and he probably wouldn\u0027t do a thing once he had the money in his hand.\"\\n\\n I told her she was probably right. She apologized again, unnecessarily, and asked if I thought she should stay in New York. She was supposed to fly home in the morning but she supposed she could stick around for a few more days.\\n\\n I told her there was no need. I gave her one of my cards and made sure I had her address and phone number written down correctly. And I walked her back to her hotel, even though she told me not to bother. I waited until she had collected her key from the desk and boarded the elevator, then went outside and looked for a taxi.\\n\\n When I walked in the door, Elaine told me Ira Wentworth had called twice. He wouldn\u0027t say what it was about, just that I should call him as soon as I got in.\\n\\n I tried his number and a nasal-voiced male said, \"Squad room, this is Acker.\" I gave my name and said I was returning Detective Wentworth\u0027s call.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not in,\" Acker said, \"but I know he wants to talk to you. Will you be staying put for the next ten minutes?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going anywhere. He\u0027s got the number, but let me give it to you again.\"\\n\\n He repeated it back to me and rang off, and I realized I\u0027d missed my chance to ask the number of the precinct. I picked up the phone and had my finger on the redial button but didn\u0027t push it.\\n\\n I had a feeling I knew which precinct it was.\\n\\n I put the phone down while I checked my notebook, picked it up again, and tried a number I\u0027d tried before, with no success. It rang once, twice, and then somebody answered but didn\u0027t speak.\\n\\n I said, \"Ira Wentworth?\"\\n\\n The voice I\u0027d heard once before, on my machine, said, \"Who the hell is this?\"\\n\\n TWENTY-SIX\\n\\n Half an hour later the doorman called upstairs to announce a Mr. Wentworth. I said to send him up, and was waiting in the hall when he got off the elevator. He was in his late thirties, tall and broad-shouldered, with a square jaw and a high forehead. His dark hair was combed straight back.\\n\\n He said his name and I said mine, and we shook hands. \"I made a couple of phone calls,\" he said. \"You were on the job yourself.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-31.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) \\n The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
