Girl wants to hire us, thinks her cousin did this bad thing. You put her mind at rest, pat her on the head and send her on her way. Then you turn around and get the rich cousin to hire us. We gonna work for one of the cousins, might as well be the one with the money.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, I almost forgot. Our client started out as the designated suspect.\"\\n\\n \"You happen to tell her that?\"\\n\\n \"It slipped my mind.\"\\n\\n We were at the Morning Star. I\u0027d slept later than usual, and Elaine had left for the gym by the time I\u0027d shaved and showered. There was coffee left, and I poured a cup and called T J. \"If you haven\u0027t had breakfast,\" I said, \"why don\u0027t you meet me downstairs in ten minutes.\" He\u0027d been up since six, he said, when a couple down the hall had a louder-than-usual drunken argument, and he\u0027d gone out and eaten, then went home and booted up his computer and got on-line. But he\u0027d gladly keep me company.\\n\\n I was working on an omelet, and he was keeping me company with a side of home fries and a toasted bagel and a large orange juice. He dabbed his lips with a napkin and said, \"Slipped your mind. Probably a good thing. There any case left, now that we on it?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hard to know where to go with it. I wish there was someone with a motive. It\u0027s a lot of trouble to go through for no reason.\"\\n\\n \"Stole some stuff,\" he said.\\n\\n \"More like borrowing it. Moved it from Manhattan to Brooklyn, where the cops recovered it.\"\\n\\n \"All of it?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a thought,\" I said. \"He might have held on to something, our mystery man.\"\\n\\n \"Might be why he did the job in the first place. Say he wants one thing, but he doesn\u0027t want anybody to know he took it.\"\\n\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n \"How I know, Beau? Something real valuable, some diamond, some priceless painting.\"\\n\\n \"It would be on the insurance schedule,\" I said, \"and it would be evident it was missing.\"\\n\\n \"Something else, then. Some legal papers, some photos or letters, kind of thing people kill to get back.\"\\n\\n \"Why not just take whatever it was,\" I said, \"and go home? Why kill the Hollanders?\"\\n\\n \"To keep everybody from finding out you took whatever it was.\"\\n\\n I thought about it. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"It sounds too complicated. Whoever did this, he put it together carefully and didn\u0027t mind killing four people to carry it off. I can\u0027t think what the Hollanders could have had in the house that would have warranted that kind of effort.\"\\n\\n \"Guess you right,\" he said. \"Just came to me is all.\"\\n\\n \"I wish something would come to me,\" I said. \"Looking at the victims doesn\u0027t seem to lead anywhere. They led a blameless life, everybody adored and respected them, and they loved each other. I wonder.\"\\n\\n \"Wonder what?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027ve been looking at the wrong victims.\"\\n\\n \"Only victims we got,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I can think of two more.\"\\n\\n It didn\u0027t take him long. \"In the house in Brooklyn,\" he said. \"Bierman and Ivanko. You sayin\u0027 he went through all that to waste those two dudes?\"\\n\\n \"No, they weren\u0027t the point, just the means to the end.\"\\n\\n \"Use \u0027em and lose \u0027em. But he had to find \u0027em first- that what you gettin\u0027 at?\"\\n\\n \"There has to be a connection. Not so much with Bierman, whose role was essentially passive.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Bout as passive as it gets,\" he said. \"All Bierman did was get hisself killed.\"\\n\\n \"Bierman may not have known him at all.\"\\n\\n \"Dude comes to the door, tells Bierman he\u0027s the exterminator, come to spray for roaches. Bierman lets him in and it\u0027s a done deal, Bierman\u0027s chillin\u0027 in the corner and the dude\u0027s out the door, wearin\u0027 Bierman\u0027s shirt an\u0027 pants.\"\\n\\n \"But Ivanko was in on the play,\" I said. \"Even if the last act came as a surprise to him.\"\\n\\n \"Dude comes to Ivanko, tells him he\u0027s got a deal lined up.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Big profit, low risk, here\u0027s the key, here\u0027s the alarm codeâ€¦\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t have that conversation with a dude \u0027less you know he be down for it. How\u0027s he know that about Ivanko?\"\\n\\n \"He did three years in Green Haven for burglary. Maybe that\u0027s where they met.\"\\n\\n \"You think the dude\u0027s an ex-con?\"\\n\\n I thought about it. \"Somehow I don\u0027t,\" I said. \"You pick up a few things in prison, but one you tend to lose there is the sense that the law can\u0027t touch you, because it already has. The guy who orchestrated all this still thinks he\u0027s bulletproof.\"\\n\\n \"Might have got his hands dirty, though.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think this was the first time he broke the law. Whether or not he\u0027s done time, he could know people who have. Ivanko\u0027s got no living relatives, as far as I can tell, and his mother\u0027s old apartment\u0027s his last known address. He must have been living somewhere when he broke into the Hollanders\u0027, but the police found him in Brooklyn before they could find out where he was staying.\"\\n\\n \"An\u0027 then they stopped lookin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"That might be a place to start,\" I said. \"If we\u0027re looking at Ivanko, you know who we ought to talk to?\"\\n\\n \"If you thinkin\u0027 same as me, it\u0027s too early to call him. He be sleepin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"Danny Boy,\" I said. \"It\u0027s his neighborhood, too. Poogan\u0027s is two blocks from the Hollander house. I\u0027ll go see him tonight.\"\\n\\n \"And between now and then?\"\\n\\n \"The gun,\" I said. \"Somebody stole it from a Central Park West psychiatrist\u0027s office.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe the gun was ready to be stolen.\"\\n\\n I gave him a look. \"The way it appeared on the surface,\" I said, \"Bierman was the shooter, so it seemed logical to assume he brought the gun. Which meant either he stole it himself or someone else stole it and sold it to him.\"\\n\\n \"But all Bierman really got,\" he said, \"was the bullet.\"\\n\\n \"Right, so somebody else supplied the gun, and it wouldn\u0027t have been Ivanko or it would have been in his hand during the burglary and not his partner\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Ivanko coulda had two guns. Didn\u0027t need both, so he kept one and gave the other to the mystery man.\"\\n\\n \"Ivanko didn\u0027t have a gun on him when they found him,\" I said, \"but the killer could always have taken it off his body on his way out. Simplest explanation, though, is that there was only one gun, and the man who used it is the man who brought it along.\"\\n\\n \"The dude himself. Where\u0027d he get it? From the shrink\u0027s office?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s where it came from, and he must have been the one who took it.\"\\n\\n \"Why couldn\u0027t he buy it on the street? Not the hardest thing in the world to do, if you know your way around.\"\\n\\n \"The pillowcases,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Forgot about them. Same deal in both break-ins, at the shrink\u0027s and at the Hollanders\u0027. Stripped the pillows, used the cases to carry off the goods.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a fairly natural thing to do,\" I said, \"and it saves hunting in the closet for tote bags, but when it pops up in both burglaries- \"\\n\\n \"Likely the same person done both.\"\\n\\n \"Seems that way.\"\\n\\n \"If it was Ivanko, well, ain\u0027t burglary what he went away for? Maybe that\u0027s something he always did, strip the pillows an\u0027 turn the cases into sacks for Santa.\"\\n\\n \"Full of toys for girls and boys. I can\u0027t see Ivanko picking that apartment to break into. It\u0027s a doorman building facing the park. Ivanko was street-smart, but street\u0027s all he was. How would he get past the doorman?\"\\n\\n \"Or even know about the shrink\u0027s place to begin with?\"\\n\\n \"The burglar knew about the gun. That\u0027s the only thing he took from the office, and he took it out of a locked drawer. And he did it without making a mess, because the shrink didn\u0027t even miss the gun until a couple of days after the burglary.\"\\n\\n \"Burglar knew the shrink.\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"Knew the office, knew how to get past the doorman. Knew about the gun.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s probably what brought him. He wanted a gun, so he broke in and took one.\"\\n\\n \"From the drawer where he already knew the shrink kept it. He knows the office, then he most likely knows the shrink.\"\\n\\n \"Stands to reason,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You tried with the shrink, didn\u0027t you? Called him or something?\"\\n\\n \"I think a more imaginative approach might yield better results.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said, \"you imaginative, when you puts your mind to it. That what you gonna do today?\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"I disremember the doctor\u0027s name. Keep thinking Adler, but that ain\u0027t right.\"\\n\\n \"Nadler.\"\\n\\n \"Nadler. There was an Adler \u0027round the time Freud started the whole thing. What\u0027s the matter?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing, why?\"\\n\\n \"The look on your face. You didn\u0027t think I knew that, did you?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s surprising, what you know and what you don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n He nodded, as if he could accept the truth in that. He said, \"Psychoanalysis. Anything to it, you figure?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re asking the wrong person. I think they\u0027ve gotten away from that approach nowadays, though. Easier to write out a prescription than listen to neurotics all day long.\"\\n\\n \"Listen to Prozac instead. You don\u0027t need me to see Dr. Nadler with you, do you?\"\\n\\n \"I think that might be counterproductive.\"\\n\\n \"All you had to say was no. What I\u0027ll do, I\u0027ll go to Brooklyn, take a look at that house.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"Talk to people, see what\u0027s shakin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you\u0027ll find something I missed,\" I said. \"You want the D train to Avenue M, incidentally. I got off a stop too soon.\"\\n\\n \"Wrong house. I was thinkin\u0027 I\u0027d see how the boyfriend\u0027s doin\u0027 in Williamsburg. She tell you the address?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t ask.\"\\n\\n \"Not like you. She at least mention the street?\"\\n\\n I searched my memory. \"No,\" I said, \"I\u0027m pretty sure she didn\u0027t. She\u0027d have to know the street, and probably the house number as well. She was thinking about moving there.\"\\n\\n \"Boyfriend\u0027s name\u0027s Peter Meredith?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, and he\u0027s the original Mr. Five-by-Five and wouldn\u0027t kill a cockroach. Where are you going?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t go nowhere,\" he said. \"Be right back.\"\\n\\n He was gone long enough for me to drink another cup of coffee and call for the check, and I was waiting for change when he came back. \"I had half of a half a bagel left,\" he said. \"You eat it?\"\\n\\n \"The waiter took it.\"\\n\\n \"Damn,\" he said. \"How I look?\"\\n\\n He\u0027d been wearing knee-length camo shorts and an oversize sweatshirt with the sleeves cut off, and he\u0027d changed into the pants from a black pinstripe suit and a white shirt with short sleeves and a button-down collar. No tie. His black shoes were polished. There were four pens in his shirt pocket, and he was carrying a clipboard.\\n\\n \"You look like a city employee,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Buildings Department.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re usually older,\" I said. \"And thicker through the middle.\"\\n\\n \"And lighter-complected.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-21.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) \\n The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
