{"id":64642,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"I asked about Bierman and Ivanko. Had Byrne Hollander ever represented either of them, or had any dealings that involved either man? Harding recognized the names and was shaking his head before I could finish asking the question. \"Ours is an exclusively civil practice,\" he told me, and he didn\u0027t mean they were polite to one another, although I suppose that went without saying. \"None of the partners or associates handle criminal cases.\" \"Even crooks draw wills,\" I said, \"or get named in other people\u0027s. I\u0027m trying to find a connection between either of the two killers and the Hollander family- or to rule it out.\" \"My feeling is that you can do the latter. Rule it out.\" Just by force of will, evidently. \"What I\u0027d like you to do,\" I said, \"is run a global search of Hollander\u0027s hard drive.\" I\u0027d memorized what T J had suggested earlier, and I could rattle it off, even if I didn\u0027t entirely understand what I was saying. \"Not just file names but within the files, looking for either of the two names, Bierman or Ivanko.\" He swore he couldn\u0027t do that. The files were confidential, first of all, their contents subject to attorney-client privilege. On top of that, Hollander\u0027s computer files were protected by Hollander\u0027s password. I told him he\u0027d obviously found the password or he\u0027d be too busy to talk to me, with all of Hollander\u0027s unfinished work clogging the system. And I told him I didn\u0027t want to violate attorney-client privilege, just to look for two names. If he couldn\u0027t find them, it would be no violation to tell me so. If they showed up, he could always tell me he\u0027d changed his mind and I should go to hell. In the end, I guess it was easier for him to enter a few keystrokes and click his mouse a few times than to explain to me all that was wrong with my reasoning. And, as I\u0027d anticipated, he didn\u0027t have occasion to strain his ethical conscience. Neither name, Bierman or Ivanko, appeared anywhere in Byrne Hollander\u0027s files. When I talked to Ray Gruliow, I\u0027d also made it a point to ask him about the two killers. They didn\u0027t strike me as likely clients for him, but you never knew. If there was a way to paint the violation of the Hollanders as a political act, a blow against the system struck from the left or right, Hard-Way Ray could have done what he does best- i.e., put the system on trial, confuse the hell out of everybody, and win an acquittal for his loathsome clients. He\u0027d never represented either of them, or so much as heard of them until they turned up dead on Coney Island Avenue. Drew Kaplan, who has a one-man general practice in Brooklyn, hadn\u0027t had any contact with them, either, but he said Bierman\u0027s name was familiar, though he couldn\u0027t say why. \"You ought to be able to find out who represented them in their court appearances,\" he said. \"It\u0027s a matter of record. Whether the attorneys will feel free to talk to you is something else, but finding them ought to be easy.\" I\u0027d already worked that out myself. Ivanko had had Legal Aid lawyers the several times he\u0027d been brought up on charges, and I called the one I could track down- one of the others had died and another had quit and moved out of state. She said she couldn\u0027t tell me anything, that a client\u0027s death didn\u0027t end privilege. Anyway, she said, there was nothing to tell me. She\u0027d been the one who represented Ivanko on the attempted rape charge, when the witness blew it at the lineup, and she\u0027d been on the scene and able to move for a dismissal, and got it. That was as much contact as she\u0027d had with him, and I got the impression it was more than she wanted. The next time she drew an accused rapist, she volunteered, she\u0027d switched with a male colleague. \"Because I wasn\u0027t confident I could represent the client effectively,\" she said. I called around, and had trouble getting Bierman\u0027s record. I don\u0027t think anybody was holding out; it was more that they didn\u0027t have the information on hand. I could understand that. By the time Bierman\u0027s name had come up, he\u0027d already had a tag on his toe. He was down for two murders in Manhattan and a murder and suicide in Brooklyn, and he\u0027d been dead for a couple of days, so how important was it to assess his prior record? It had been of interest to the press, so what I did know was what was in the papers- that he\u0027d been arrested on a batch of minor charges, but had never drawn any prison time. He\u0027d been held overnight on a drunk and disorderly charge, picked up and released during a raid on a Brownsville crack house, cited for jumping a subway turnstile, and all in all showed the typical profile of a low-level fuckup. Burglary, assault, multiple homicide, murder- it was quite a step up. Of course Ivanko had been the rapist, Ivanko the artist with the fireplace poker, and it was very likely Ivanko who\u0027d cut Susan Hollander\u0027s throat. But Ivanko certainly hadn\u0027t shot himself three times. That would have been Bierman\u0027s work, and it seemed reasonable to assume he\u0027d also been the one to use the gun earlier, in the house on West Seventy-fourth Street. He\u0027d fired three shots both times, before something made him send a seventh bullet up through the soft palate and into his brain. It was the same gun both times, I knew that. A.22 auto, and what model was it? How many cartridges did the clip hold, and how many were left after he killed himself? Had he had to reload? So many things I didn\u0027t know. I stayed busy that week, even when I wasn\u0027t bothering cops and lawyers. I made a trip to the storage warehouse for Elaine, and spelled her at her shop one afternoon when she had an auction she wanted to go to. Didn\u0027t make any sales, but I didn\u0027t break anything, either, so we figured it was a wash. I went to three meetings, two at St. Paul\u0027s and one noon meeting at the West Side Y. And Elaine and I got to two concerts, the second a Baroque ensemble that flew in from Bratislava. Elaine couldn\u0027t think of anyone she knew who\u0027d been to Bratislava, and I told her I used to know a guy who\u0027d been born there. I met him years ago at a meeting in the Village, but he\u0027d come here as a child, and his earliest memories were of the Lower East Side, around Pitt and Madison. All those buildings were gone now, he\u0027d told me, and it was just as well. We didn\u0027t go to Bratislava, but walked out of the concert hall and cabbed down to the Village, where we caught an extended set at a basement jazz club off Sheridan Square. The audience was as respectfully attentive as the crowd at Lincoln Center, although they tapped their feet more and applauded at the end of solos. We didn\u0027t say much, and went straight home afterward. At the kitchen table I said, \"I had a dream the other night.\" \"Oh?\" \"I don\u0027t remember how it started. Does anybody ever remember how dreams start?\" \"How could you? Your mind would have to remember what it was doing before it started dreaming. Like remembering before you were born, although there are people who claim they can do that.\" \"Hard to prove.\" \"Or disprove,\" she said, \"but I didn\u0027t mean to change the subject. You had a dream.\" \"Anita was in it. She was dying or she was dead, I don\u0027t remember which. I think she was dying at the start of the dream, struggling to breathe, and then it shifted and I realized that she was dead. She was looking at me, but I somehow knew she wasn\u0027t alive.\" She waited. \"She was blaming me. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you do something? I\u0027m dead and it\u0027s your fault. Why didn\u0027t you save me?\u0027 Those aren\u0027t the words, I don\u0027t remember the words, but that\u0027s what she was saying.\" She stirred her tea. I don\u0027t know why, she doesn\u0027t put anything in it. She took the spoon out, set it in the saucer. \"Then she disappeared,\" I said. \"She disappeared?\" \"She sort of faded,\" I said. \"Or maybe she melted, like the Wicked Witch of the West. She just gradually wasn\u0027t there anymore.\" \"And?\" \"That\u0027s it,\" I said. \"I woke up. Otherwise I probably wouldn\u0027t have remembered the dream. I hardly ever do, you know. I suppose I dream, they say everybody does, but I don\u0027t often remember them.\" \"If we were supposed to remember them,\" she said, \"we\u0027d be awake when they happened.\" \"Sometimes,\" I said, \"I\u0027ll wake up in the morning with the feeling that I dreamed, and the sense that I could remember the dream if I just tried hard enough.\" \"How would you go about trying to remember something?\" \"I have no idea. It never works, I\u0027ll tell you that much. The dream never comes back to me. But that sensation of having dreamed, it can be very convincing.\" \"And you\u0027ve had it a lot lately?\" I nodded. \"And I have a feeling it\u0027s always the same dream.\" \"The one you had the other night, and did remember.\" \"That or a variation on it. I don\u0027t have any evidence of this, but I\u0027m not sure \u0027dream\u0027 and \u0027evidence\u0027 belong in the same sentence to begin with.\" \"She dies and there\u0027s nothing you can do.\" \"She dies and there\u0027s nothing I can do, she\u0027s dead and I should have done something.\" \"Do you remember the feeling that went with it?\" \"What you\u0027d expect, I guess. Helplessness, guilt. A desire to do something and a complete inability to think of anything to do.\" After a moment she said, \"There really wasn\u0027t anything you could do.\" \"I know that.\" \"Or anything you should have done. You didn\u0027t even know she was ill, and how could you? Nobody told you.\" \"No.\" \"But I suppose it goes back farther than that, doesn\u0027t it?\" \"Thirty years,\" I said, \"or whenever it was that I walked out.\" \"Still blame yourself?\" I shook my head. \"Not really. I did all the crap they teach you in AA, I sorted it out, I made amends. I\u0027m not proud of every decision I made during the drinking years, if you can even call them decisions. But I don\u0027t have trouble living with any of it, and I wound up in the right place. Sober, and married to the right woman.\" \"But sometimes you think you should have stayed married to the wrong one.\" \"No, I don\u0027t think that.\" \"Not that you\u0027d be happier, or better off. But that it would have been the right thing to do.\" \"Maybe when I\u0027m dreaming,\" I said. \"Not when my mind\u0027s working. It\u0027s just…\" \"Everything,\" she supplied. \"She died,\" I said, \"out of the blue, and that was a shock, and then the funeral, and the happy horseshit afterward with Michael and Andy. Did I tell you about the bar where I met the two of them?\" \"Bowls full of miniature Hershey bars.\" \"That\u0027s the one. I wanted a drink.\" \"I would have wanted a candy bar.\" \"I didn\u0027t have a drink,\" I said, \"or think seriously about it. But the desire was as strong as it\u0027s been in a while.\" \"Part of the deal, isn\u0027t it? And you didn\u0027t have a drink, and that\u0027s what counts.\" \"I know.\" \"That\u0027s why you\u0027re looking into what happened to the Hollanders, isn\u0027t it?\" \"One way or another,\" I said. \"I needed something to do. And if I were inclined to play amateur psychologist- \" \"Which God knows you\u0027re not.\" \"Which I trust God knows I\u0027m not, I\u0027d say I was reenacting my dream, trying to save Susan Hollander when it was already too late.\" \"Just her?\" \"Hell, make it both of them. I\u0027m reliving my childhood and trying to save both my parents. Do you like that better?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-14.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
