Funny how the Times missed out on the connection between the Hollanders and the death of Sharon Tate.\" \"That sounds reasonable,\" I said. \"Charles Manson had as much to do with the death of the Hollanders as their daughter Kristin did, which is as much as anybody did outside of those two losers out in Brooklyn.\" He held out the folder and I took it, saying, \"What\u0027s the point? There\u0027s nothing here for us. We spent an hour or so yesterday taking a load off your girlfriend\u0027s mind.\" \"Not my girlfriend.\" \"Just a friend. I stand corrected.\" I hefted the file folder. \"Why do I need to look at all this?\" \"Why did we need to look at the house where it all went down?\" \"Curiosity,\" I said. \"Killed the cat,\" he said. He pointed at the folder. \"Kill a few more,\" he said, and headed for the elevator. Monday morning I called Joe Durkin and asked him if he\u0027d like to do me a favor. \"It\u0027s the real reason I come to work every morning,\" he said. \"What I do for the city is beside the point.\" I told him what I wanted. He said, \"Why, for God\u0027s sake? What are you, turning into a writer? You plan on writing it up for one of the True Detective magazines?\" \"I hadn\u0027t thought of that, but it would be a good cover sometime.\" \"Guys would expect to see clips. Seriously, Matt, what\u0027s your interest? And don\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve got a client.\" \"How could I? They lifted my license.\" \"Way I heard it, you surrendered it voluntarily. And what difference would that make? You worked years without one.\" \"That was my point, as I recall.\" \"One of them,\" he said, and something hung for a moment in the air between us. He asked who hired me and I said I honestly didn\u0027t have a client. He said, \"The daughter? How much closure does she need, for Christ\u0027s sake? The bastards who did it are dead. What\u0027s she need with you nosing around?\" \"I haven\u0027t even met the daughter,\" I said, \"and I don\u0027t have a client. My interest is personal.\" \"You\u0027re a public-spirited citizen and you want to see justice done.\" \"I gather it\u0027s already been done,\" I said. \"Did I mention that Elaine and I were at dinner with the Hollanders the night they were killed?\" \"It seems to me you did. You were at separate tables together, the way I remember it. You know, there was an elderly gentleman beaten to death on the G train just last month, and G\u0027s my father\u0027s middle initial, but I never felt the need to get together with the guy who headed up the investigation. Of course it might have been different if I had a client.\" \"If I had a client, any kind of a client,\" I said, \"I\u0027d have work to do, and I\u0027d be too busy to waste my time bothering with a case that\u0027s already been closed.\" \"That\u0027s reason enough to wish you had your license back,\" he said. \"You\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t you? Lemme make a phone call, see what I can do.\" He got back to me twenty minutes later with a name and a number. \"I don\u0027t know this guy,\" he said, \"but the word is he\u0027s straight-up and thorough, though not necessarily the very man you\u0027d want Regis to call for you if you couldn\u0027t remember the capital of Ethiopia.\" \"I hope you were as complimentary when you told him about me.\" \"I said you probably wouldn\u0027t steal a hot stove, and the morals charge was dismissed when the boy\u0027s mother withdrew the complaint. I know, you don\u0027t know how to thank me, but don\u0027t worry. You\u0027ll think of something.\" The fellow who\u0027d stayed at the curb to make sure Kristin Hollander got into her house okay had a cell phone, and he\u0027d used it to call 911. A car from the Twentieth Precinct responded, and the uniforms reported back on what they found, and within the hour two detectives from the precinct were on the scene. It was their case, but the next day someone in charge saw what a media circus it was going to be and shuffled the cards, and a special unit was set up with a detective from Manhattan North Homicide in charge of it. \"You never like to have a case taken away from you,\" Dan Schering said. \"Ego aside, though, we were better off, because you can\u0027t put as much into an investigation if you have to stop once an hour to hold a press conference. The guy from Homicide knew how to play the media, and we went ahead and pursued the investigation, and we cracked the damn thing. Before the stink came through the door out in Brooklyn, we already had a name and a description. All we had to do was pick the bastard up, and the only thing that stopped us from doing just that was he was dead.\" Joe had suggested Schering wasn\u0027t the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he seemed bright enough to me. There was a stolid, Midwestern quality about him, and that might have been enough to lead a New Yorker like Joe Durkin to label him slow. But he reminded me of an Ohio cop I knew named Havlicek, whom I\u0027d liked and respected enough to stay in touch with. There was nothing slow about Havlicek. Schering hailed from Albert Lea, Minnesota, where he\u0027d played high school football and basketball before going to the University of Minnesota. He played freshman football but didn\u0027t make the Golden Gopher varsity, and didn\u0027t even bother trying out for basketball, where everybody was six-five or taller. His girlfriend was a theater major, and after graduation he followed her to New York, where she waited tables and went to auditions. He was riding the subway to his entry-level office job when he saw a recruiting ad for the NYPD. He sailed through the entrance exam and never looked back. The relationship didn\u0027t last and he didn\u0027t know what had become of the girl, whether she was still in New York or had gone on to L.A. or back to St. Paul, and didn\u0027t care enough to find out. When I asked him if he ever missed Minnesota he looked at me like I was out of my mind. They\u0027d known Ivanko was right for it before the DNA evidence came along to lock it up, he told me, because they\u0027d recovered a partial thumbprint from the fireplace poker. It was just one print, and a partial one at that, so it hadn\u0027t led anywhere until they acted on the tip and got hold of Ivanko\u0027s sheet. \"It was a match,\" he said. \"Forensics pegged it at something like sixty percent, so it wouldn\u0027t stand up in court as an absolute certainty, but it was as sure as you could get given the amount of the thumbprint left on the poker. In other words, we were a hundred percent certain, and it turned out there was nothing we had to sell to a judge and jury. And if we had to, well, we had the DNA. His semen, his pubic hair at the scene, plus Brooklyn Forensics found trace evidence on one of the bodies.\" \"Trace evidence?\" \"Put it this way,\" he said. \"Our boy Carl didn\u0027t have time to shower.\" It had been exciting when the tip worked out and the case started to break, and slightly anticlimactic when the cops in Brooklyn walked in on Bierman and Ivanko before the Manhattan team could track them down. But he was just as glad it turned out the way it did. \"For the victim\u0027s sake,\" he said. \"Not the actual vics, they were past caring, but the daughter. Sooner the better for someone in her position. And the two of them being dead means she\u0027s spared weeks of a trial and tons of media hype and it\u0027s over now instead of six months from now, or six years from now, or never because for the rest of her life they\u0027re calling her every few years to testify at a parole hearing. It\u0027s never really over no matter what, because losing your parents like that is something that never goes away, but at least she can close the books on it, same as we can.\" He sympathized with the girl, as anybody would have done, but that hadn\u0027t kept him from taking a good look at her. \"Because that\u0027s got to be the first thing enters your mind,\" he said. \"The parents killed in their own home, the daughter discovers the bodies, first thing you wonder is did she make it happen. Because there\u0027s cases all the time, one just four months ago in Astoria, high school girl, her parents didn\u0027t approve of the boy she was dating, and she shows them how mistaken they are by teaming up with him and shooting them both dead.\" I remembered that one. \"They didn\u0027t do too good a job,\" I said. \"She stole her father\u0027s gun,\" he said, \"and gave it to the boyfriend, and he shot the old man. Then he made the girl shoot her mother, or it was her idea, depending who you listen to. And then he goes out and steals a car and makes a drive-by shooting out of it, pumping three, four shots through the front window. And she\u0027s in the house when this happens, and she calls it in, all hysterical, and she\u0027s even got superficial cuts on her hands where she\u0027s presumably hit by flying glass from the drive-by. Which would be a nice touch except there was no flying glass, the bullets went right through, knocked out a little circle and that\u0027s all. \"And when you play What\u0027s Wrong with This Picture? the answer comes up Everything. The two bodies are in the front room, where they supposedly got shot from the drive-by, but there\u0027s blood spatters in the kitchen and other evidence indicating that at least one of them was killed there and dragged into the living room, including one slug that went through and wound up in the kitchen wall. And the bullets fired from the passing car, the trajectory\u0027s all wrong, they wound up in the living room ceiling, and with the woman, the mother, not only is the angle wrong but the wound\u0027s got powder burns. That\u0027s a neat trick, leaving powder burns around a wound inflicted from outside the house.\" So he could hardly avoid taking a careful look at Kristin Hollander. He wasn\u0027t hard on her, because chances were she was innocent, in which case the last thing anybody wanted to do was add to her pain and suffering. But he watched her reactions and he checked her alibi, and he kept an ear cocked for any false note. And there was none. \"Anybody claims he\u0027s a hundred percent human lie detector, well, he\u0027s full of crap. But you develop an instinct. You were on the job yourself, so you know how many times a day you get lied to. Bad guys just lie all the time, even when they got no reason. They got a reason, they\u0027ll tell six different lies one after the other, hoping that\u0027ll sweeten the odds and you\u0027ll believe one of them. \u0027That bag of dope? I never saw it before in my life, Officer. That bag of dope? It ain\u0027t dope, it\u0027s talcum powder, case I meet a baby needs his diaper changed. That bag of dope? Hey, man, where\u0027d that come from? Must be you planted it on me.\u0027 You\u0027re laughing, but that\u0027s how it plays out.\" \"I\u0027m laughing because the routine hasn\u0027t changed in thirty years.\" \"It never will. You don\u0027t tamper with a classic. And each of them thinks he\u0027s the first one to run this crap by you. Each one\u0027s a criminal genius in his own mind. But you\u0027re completely used to it and you know the body language that goes with it, and you can tell the lie\u0027s on its way before the first words are out of his mouth.\" And Kristin wasn\u0027t lying, he was positive of it. You couldn\u0027t fake a reaction like that, couldn\u0027t go pale on cue, couldn\u0027t have your voice climb to the top of its register without even being aware that it had done so. She\u0027d been in shock, that\u0027s what the doctor had called it, that was the medical condition she\u0027d manifested, and you couldn\u0027t act your way into it. Plus her alibi stood up a hundred percent. She was with people the whole evening, some who knew her well and others, like the one who drove her home, whom she\u0027d met that night for the first time. No way they were all lying, and their statements overlapped, covering her for the entire evening.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-11.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
