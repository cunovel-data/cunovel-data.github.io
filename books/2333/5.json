Certainly no more than three, and too young for a funeral.\\n\\n But then so was Anita.\\n\\n \"Her birthday\u0027s in November,\" I\u0027d told Elaine. \"She\u0027s three years younger than me, three and a half. That makes her fifty-eight.\"\\n\\n \"God, that seems young.\"\\n\\n \"She had a heart attack. I thought men got heart attacks.\"\\n\\n \"So do women.\"\\n\\n \"She wasn\u0027t heavy, she didn\u0027t smoke. Although what the hell do I know about it? Maybe she weighed three hundred pounds and chewed cigars. I\u0027m trying to remember the last time I saw her. I can\u0027t. I spoke to her on the phone when that lunatic Motley was on the loose, killing any woman he could find who was somehow connected to me. I told her she might be in danger and to get out of town for a while.\"\\n\\n \"I remember.\"\\n\\n \"She was pissed off. How dare I interfere in her life? I told her it wasn\u0027t by choice, but I have to say I could see her point. You divorce a guy and move on, you don\u0027t want to have to run and hide because he got himself on somebody\u0027s shit list.\"\\n\\n \"You must have talked to her since then.\"\\n\\n \"I did. I remember now, I called to congratulate her when Melanie was born. Wait a minute, that\u0027s wrong. I called, all right. But I got him instead, Thiele, and he said Anita had flown out to see the kid for herself.\"\\n\\n \"And you called Michael\u0027s house, and she answered the phone.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. I remember she kept telling me how beautiful Melanie was, as if she was telling herself as much as she was telling me. It bothered her when Michael and June got married.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know that. Because she\u0027s Chinese?\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. So Michael said. Because it would be difficult for them, coming from different cultures, di dah di dah di dah. That\u0027s how she put it, but I think all it was was she didn\u0027t want a Chinese daughter-in-law, or grandchildren with slanted eyes.\"\\n\\n \"But she got over it.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sure. People do. And Anita was never mean-spirited, or particularly narrow-minded. It was just that she didn\u0027t know any Asians. Then her son married one and she got used to it.\"\\n\\n \"How do you feel, baby?\"\\n\\n \"About June? I think she\u0027s the best thing that ever happened to Michael, with the possible exception of Melanie. But that\u0027s not what you mean.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure how I feel,\" I said. \"Like I\u0027ve lost something, but what? She hasn\u0027t been in my life for years.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you\u0027ve lost part of the past.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe. Whatever it is, I feel sad.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n We were silent for a long moment, and then she asked me if I wanted another cup of coffee. I said I thought Monica got the last cup, and anyway I didn\u0027t figure I needed any more coffee.\\n\\n \"She died Saturday morning,\" I said. \"The boys flew in Sunday. I don\u0027t know where Andy\u0027s living now. It was Denver last I heard, but that was a while ago. He doesn\u0027t stay anyplace for very long.\"\\n\\n \"Gathers no moss.\"\\n\\n \"They flew in yesterday,\" I said, \"and called me tonight.\" I let that hang in the air, and then I said, \"The funeral\u0027s tomorrow. Out in Syosset.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll go, won\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose so. Pick up a car from Avis and drive out. It\u0027s at two in the afternoon, so I\u0027ll miss the rush hour going out, and probably coming back, too.\" I looked down at my hands. \"I can\u0027t say I\u0027m looking forward to it.\"\\n\\n \"I think you should go, though.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve got much choice.\"\\n\\n \"Do you want me to come? Because I will if you want, and I won\u0027t feel hurt if you don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"I think maybe not,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Or I could keep you company and wait in the car, so you won\u0027t be parading Anita\u0027s replacement in front of all her friends. Or, as far as that goes, T J would be glad to keep you company.\"\\n\\n \"He could wear a chauffeur\u0027s cap,\" I said, \"and I could ride in the back seat. No, I\u0027ll drive myself, I think, and keep myself company. I don\u0027t know that I\u0027ll mind the solitude. I\u0027ll probably have things to think about.\"\\n\\n So I sat there in the last row and thought about things, and when the service ended I walked up the aisle and mumbled something to Graham Thiele, something about how sorry I was, and he mumbled something back, assuring me it was good of me to come. We could have phoned it in, both of us. Then I turned to Michael and Andy. They were both wearing suits and ties, of course, and they looked good dressed up like that, my two big handsome sons.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you could come,\" Michael said. \"The service was okay, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n \"It seemed fine,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Are you going to ride out to the cemetery? I could see if there\u0027s room in the limo with us, or you could just join the parade, except they don\u0027t call it that. What\u0027s the word?\"\\n\\n \"Cortege,\" Andy supplied.\\n\\n \"And afterward we\u0027re all going back to Graham\u0027s house. Uh, their house.\"\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027ll pass,\" I said. \"On the house, and on the cemetery. I think I\u0027d be out of place.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s up to you,\" Michael said. \"Strictly your call.\"\\n\\n Andy said, \"Whatever, we\u0027ve got a job to do.\" He was pulling on a pair of black silk gloves. \"We\u0027re pallbearers,\" he said. \"It\u0027s hard to take it all in, you know?\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re going to close the casket. If you want to take a last look at Momâ€¦\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t much want to, but then I hadn\u0027t really wanted to come out to Syosset, either. There are things you just do, and the hell with what you want or don\u0027t want. I went over and looked at her and was immediately sorry I had. She looked dead, waxen, looked as though she had never been alive in the first place.\\n\\n I turned away and blinked a few times but the image was still there. It would stay with me for a while, I knew, and then it would fade, and eventually I would remember the woman I used to know, the woman I\u0027d married, the woman I\u0027d fallen in love with once upon a time.\\n\\n I looked for my sons and there they were, both wearing the black pallbearer\u0027s gloves now, both with expressions that were hard to read. \"Maybe we could meet someplace afterward,\" I suggested. \"It\u0027s what, two years since I last saw you, Mike? And I can\u0027t remember the last time I saw you, Andy.\"\\n\\n \"I can,\" he said, \"because it\u0027s the last time I was in New York. Four years ago, and I met Elaine for the first time, and the three of us walked to a restaurant and had dinner.\"\\n\\n \"Paris Green.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the one.\"\\n\\n \"Well, is there a place here in Syosset where we can meet? A coffee shop or something? After the cemetery, and after you\u0027ve had a chance to see people back at the house.\"\\n\\n They exchanged glances. Michael said, \"Once we get back to the house, I think we have to stay there. There\u0027s a lot of people who\u0027ll be dropping in, and I think we\u0027d be missed if we slipped out.\"\\n\\n \"Mom had a lot of friends,\" Andy said.\\n\\n \"Maybe between the cemetery and the house,\" I said. But they\u0027d be riding in the limo, Michael said, and Andy said the limo\u0027d bring them back here, that was the plan, and they\u0027d get their own cars.\\n\\n \"So June can drive your car back,\" he said, \"and I\u0027ll run you and me over to Hershey\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"God, not the Hershey Bar,\" Michael said. To me he said, \"It\u0027s a beer bar, it\u0027s all high school and college kids, it\u0027s crowded and noisy. You wouldn\u0027t like it. As far as that goes, I wouldn\u0027t like it.\"\\n\\n \"You used to,\" Andy said. \"Before you turned into an old man. Anyway, it\u0027s an afternoon in the middle of the week. How rowdy do you think it\u0027s going to be?\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, the Hershey Bar,\" Michael said.\\n\\n \"Well, pick someplace better, if you can think of one.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t, and they\u0027re waiting for us, so I guess it\u0027s the Hershey Bar.\" He gave me quick directions and then the two of them let one of the mortuary staff guide them to their places on opposite sides of the now-sealed casket. Anita\u0027s brother, Phil, had the spot behind Andy, and there were three other men whom I didn\u0027t recognize.\\n\\n I left them to their work.\\n\\n I drove out to the cemetery after all. I hadn\u0027t planned on it, but somehow my car wound up queueing along with the others, and I sat there and followed the car in front of me. We had a police escort, so we didn\u0027t have to stop for traffic lights, and I told myself the cops out here had it easy, with nothing to do but take an occasional run out to the cemetery. But I knew better. They have crime on Long Island, and people selling drugs and other people using them, and men who batter their wives and abuse their children, and others who drive drunk and plow head-on into a school bus. They don\u0027t have Crips and Bloods and drive-by shootings yet, not that I\u0027ve heard, but they probably won\u0027t have long to wait.\\n\\n I stayed in my car at the cemetery while everybody else walked over to the graveside for the service. I could see them from where I was parked, and as soon as the service was over I started my engine and found my way out of there.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t paid close attention to the route to the cemetery- you don\u0027t when all you have to do is tag along after the car in front of you- and I took a few wrong turns on the way back, and a few more finding my way to the Hershey Bar. I parked and went in, expecting my sons would already be there, but the place was empty except for the bartender, a blue-jawed skinhead in a Metallica T-shirt, its sleeves rolled up to show health club muscles, and his sole customer, an old man in a cloth cap and a thrift-shop overcoat. The old fellow looked like he belonged on a bar stool at the Blarney Stone or the White Rose, but here he was at a college kids\u0027 bar in Syosset, drinking his beer out of a heavy glass mug.\\n\\n There were college pennants on the rough wooden walls, and beer steins hanging from the exposed beams, and the bar and tabletops held bowls of miniature chocolate bars. Hershey bars, of course, in several varieties, along with foil-wrapped Hershey\u0027s Kisses. It was consistent with the name of the joint, to be sure, but why would anyone want to nibble chocolate as an accompaniment to beer? I could think of several bars that used to set out complimentary bowls of peanuts in the shell, and I remembered the chickpeas at Max\u0027s Kansas City, but who\u0027d want to pair a Dos Equis or a St. Pauli Girl with a Hershey\u0027s Kiss?\\n\\n The bartender was looking at me, eyebrows raised, and I didn\u0027t want a beer or a chocolate bar. I wanted bourbon, better make it a double, straight up, and leave the bottle.\\n\\n I patted my pockets as if I\u0027d lost something- my wallet, my car keys, my cigarettes. \"Be right back,\" I said, and got out of there and sat in my car. I turned the key so I could play the radio, and I found a station that featured what they called Classic Country, which Elaine would call a contradiction in terms. But they played Hank Williams and Patsy Cline and Red Foley and Kitty Wells, and then Mike and Andy pulled in and got out of a gray Honda Accord. When they reached the entrance Mike said something, and Andy gave him a poke in the shoulder and held the door open, and the two of them disappeared inside.\\n\\n I waited for the last notes of \"It Wasn\u0027t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels.\" Then I went in after them.\\n\\n FOUR\\n\\n Mike ordered a Heineken\u0027s and I said I\u0027d have a glass of Coke. The bartender asked if Pepsi would be all right, and I said it would be fine. Neither one was what I wanted, but I wasn\u0027t going to have what I wanted, and the fact was I didn\u0027t really want it anymore. The urge had been strong enough to get me the hell out of there, but wanting a drink is a world away from having one, and now the wanting had passed. A Coke would have been fine, and a Pepsi would be fine, and so would a glass of water, or nothing at all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-5.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) \\n The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
