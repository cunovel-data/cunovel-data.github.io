You can\u0027t shake hands over the phone, but even if you could I think he\u0027d have passed it up. He\u0027d been wary earlier, thrown off-stride by my having called him on Lia Parkman\u0027s cell phone. He\u0027d picked it up once they\u0027d established there were no fingerprints but hers to be found on it, and he\u0027d been carrying it around ever since.\n That was how he\u0027d called me. The phone logged recent calls, and all he\u0027d had to do was find the last call she\u0027d made and open the mouthpiece to redial it. He\u0027d called me without knowing who I was. Thus his original message, requesting I call back without identifying me by name.\n Then I\u0027d called back and left my name, and he\u0027d called again, twice, and left messages, and I called him, and Charlie Acker had managed to reach him, and he was all set to call me when the phone in his pocket rang. And it was me, asking for him by name, and confusing the hell out of him for a minute there.\n Over the phone, he hadn\u0027t even been willing to confirm that she was dead. But I already knew that. I knew the minute I heard his voice instead of hers, and I may have known when I placed the call.\n \"This is a nice building,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve never been inside, but I\u0027ve admired it many times from the street. You been here long?\"\n \"A couple of years. I\u0027ve lived in the neighborhood a lot longer.\"\n \"Nice,\" he said. \"Walk to the park, walk to the theaters. Very convenient.\" He admired the apartment, too, as I led him through it to the kitchen. Elaine was in the bedroom with the door closed, but she\u0027d made a pot of coffee first, and I poured us each a cup and sat down with him at the kitchen table.\n He tried the coffee and said it was outstanding, and I asked him about Lia Parkman, and he said, yes, she was dead. Her body had been discovered shortly after five that afternoon by one of her roommates. She lived in student housing on Claremont Avenue, shared a unit with three other students, and two of them were home at the time, and one of them knocked on the closed bathroom door, got no response, and walked in to find her in the bathtub, drowned, dead.\n \"Cause of death\u0027s drowning,\" he said. \"Water in the lungs confirms that, pending final results from the medical examiner. Open pint bottle of Georgi vodka on the dresser next to the cell phone. Her prints on the bottle, nobody else\u0027s. Initial impression, she had a drink or two, went to take a bath, passed out and drowned.\"\n \"I can\u0027t believe that\u0027s what happened.\"\n \"Well,\" he said, \"neither can I, but probably for reasons that are different from yours. First off, there\u0027s marks on her neck suggesting she might have been choked. That\u0027s also pending word from the ME\u0027s office, but it gets your attention. Then there\u0027s the vodka. Just a couple of ounces gone, and you don\u0027t figure that\u0027s enough to make a healthy young woman pass out. Granted, different people react differently, and if the water in the tub\u0027s real hot it could be a contributing factor, but it\u0027s unlikely. Of course she could have had a couple of pops before she got home, or pills of some sort, and the last slug of vodka made the difference. Once again, we\u0027ll know more when we get the autopsy results.\"\n \"Was she much of a drinker?\"\n He nodded approvingly. \"That\u0027s where I was going next. According to the roommates, she hardly drank at all. Maybe a glass of white wine at a party, but the idea of her bringing a bottle back to her room, they couldn\u0027t see it. And then there\u0027s the prints on the bottle.\"\n \"Her prints, you said.\"\n \"Just her prints. What was the clerk in the liquor store doing, wearing gloves? Plus the prints are from her right hand, and she\u0027s right-handed.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"Bottle\u0027s got a twist-off cap. You\u0027re going to open a bottle, how do you do it?\"\n I moved my hands in the air, working it out for myself. It had been a long time since I uncapped a pint of liquor, but I suppose any bottle would qualify, even salad dressing. \"I think I\u0027d hold the bottle in my left hand,\" I said, \"and turn the cap with my right.\"\n \"If you\u0027re right-handed,\" Wentworth said, \"that\u0027s how you\u0027d do it.\"\n \"Any prints on the cap?\"\n \"None.\" He picked up his coffee cup, but it was empty. He didn\u0027t ask for more, but I got the carafe and filled both our cups, and he grinned. \"I\u0027ll regret it,\" he said, \"drinking a second cup this late at night, but the hell with it. Some sins are worth the punishment. You grind the beans yourself?\" I said we did, and he said it made a difference. Then he said, \"There\u0027s another thing, made a little alarm bell go off for me. Her clothes.\"\n \"Her clothes?\"\n \"Toilet lid\u0027s down and her clothes are folded and stacked on top of it, neat as a pin. She came in, ran a tub, got undressed, and hopped in.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"Where\u0027s her towel? They share the bathroom, the four of them, so they each have their own towels and keep them in their rooms. There\u0027s a hand towel there for everybody\u0027s use, but it\u0027s too small to use after a bath. How come she forgot her towel?\"\n \"All that vodka,\" I said.\n \"Yeah, right.\" He ran a hand through his hair. \"None of this is conclusive, but it makes me want to take a second look. Which I\u0027d be doing anyway if the medical examiner comes up with anything interesting. But while we wait for word from him, I\u0027m treating this as a homicide.\"\n \"I think you\u0027re right to.\"\n \"So you said, and I\u0027d love to know why. I\u0027d also like to know why you\u0027re the last person she called, and what your connection is to her in the first place.\"\n \"I\u0027m doing some work for Kristin Hollander.\"\n \"Name\u0027s familiar.\"\n \"She\u0027s the daughter of Byrne and Susan Hollander.\"\n \"Couple killed in that home invasion end of July.\"\n \"That\u0027s right. Lia Parkman is Kristin\u0027s cousin, Susan Hollander\u0027s niece.\"\n \"Jesus,\" he said. \"Now why the hell didn\u0027t anybody tell me that? The one roommate said something about she was depressed about a recent death in the family, but that wasn\u0027t just a death, it was a fucking bloodbath. But the perps are dead, aren\u0027t they? Murder and suicide out in Coney Island?\"\n \"Coney Island Avenue,\" I said. \"Which is actually in Midwood.\"\n \"Close enough. You\u0027re doing some work for the daughter, and I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027re putting a new roof on the house. You\u0027re doing what, investigating?\"\n \"It\u0027s unofficial,\" I said. \"But yes, I\u0027m investigating.\"\n \"And offhand I can only think of one thing you could be investigating. Case is closed, right?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"And the daughter thinks the whole story hasn\u0027t come out yet. Or you think that, or both. Which is it?\"\n \"Both.\"\n \"And that\u0027s what put you on to the cousin? Help me out here. How does she fit in?\"\n I brought him up to speed, just hitting the high points- the front door key, the numeric code for the burglar alarm. \"Lia Parkman had a key and she knew the keypad code,\" I said. \"This afternoon I managed to sit down with her and ask her who might have borrowed the key or doped out the code. She said she couldn\u0027t think of anybody, but I knew she was holding something back.\"\n \"Sometimes you can tell.\"\n \"I could tell,\" I said, \"but I couldn\u0027t do anything about it. Maybe I should have kept at her. I had to make a judgment call, and I decided I was better off letting her think about it. I gave her a card, told her to call me if she came up with anything.\"\n \"And she did.\"\n \"If I\u0027d come straight home,\" I said, then broke it off. \"But I didn\u0027t, and by the time I got here she\u0027d called and left a message. I called her right back and got her voice mail.\"\n \"That\u0027s because her phone was turned off. When that happens the voice mail kicks in. You leave her a message?\"\n \"No, what for? I figured I\u0027d try her until I got her. And I did, a couple of times, with the same results. I didn\u0027t even know it was a cell phone, I figured it was the phone in her room and she was out.\"\n \"They rarely have actual phones in their rooms, the college kids. It\u0027s all cell phones. It\u0027s simpler, when you\u0027re moving all the time.\"\n \"Even if I\u0027d left a message,\" I said, \"she never would have received it. He must have already killed her by then.\"\n \"He must have been very fucking slick,\" he said. \"Did I mention two of her three roommates were home when it happened? They were studying, they had music playing, but even so. He had to get in the building, get in the apartment, get into her bedroom, take her down, then drag her into the bathroom, strip her, hold her under until she drowns, and then get out of the place without bumping into anybody.\"\n \"If he\u0027s clever about it,\" I said, \"and if his luck is running- \"\n \"Oh, it\u0027s doable, no question. And he wasn\u0027t perfect.\"\n \"The towel.\"\n \"The towel is one. He probably just assumed towels are in the bathroom, you don\u0027t have to take one. But her bath towel was on a hook in her closet, and she wouldn\u0027t have left it there and then got in the tub. The vodka bottle\u0027s another. It\u0027s more plausible without the liquor- she stumbles, hits her head on the tub, whatever, drowns before she recovers consciousness. That\u0027s more plausible than an afternoon drunk on two ounces of Georgi with a girl who\u0027s not a drinker to begin with. Plus where\u0027s the bag?\"\n \"The bag?\"\n \"You ever buy a pint of booze and not have them put it in a paper bag for you? She\u0027d have left the bottle in the bag until she got home, not tossed the bag on her way home. And the fingerprints. He was cute, wiping the bottle, getting her prints on it, but he used the wrong hand and didn\u0027t bother with the cap. That\u0027s not enough to hang him, but it\u0027s plenty to make a person take a second look.\"\n \"You think so? Most people wouldn\u0027t even notice.\"\n \"Well, I noticed.\"\n \"But you\u0027re pretty good at this,\" I said. \"A little smarter than the average bear.\"\n He colored, surprised by the compliment. \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" he said. \"If I was that goddam good, I\u0027d be able to tell you who killed her.\"\n \"According to Lia,\" I said, \"his name is Arden Brill.\"\n \"Hell,\" he said. \"It sounds more like Arden than anything else, doesn\u0027t it? Could you play it one more time?\"\n I had gone into the bedroom to fetch the answering machine, but Elaine woke up while I was unplugging it and insisted I leave the machine where it was and bring Wentworth in. She disappeared into the bathroom, and emerged during the second playing of the message, wearing a robe and fresh makeup. Since then we\u0027d heard the message another half-dozen times, and were getting less certain with each hearing.\n \"Arden,\" he said. \"Isn\u0027t that a place? The Arden Forest?\"\n \"In Shakespeare,\" Elaine said. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a real forest.\"\n \"No? It\u0027s just made up?\"\n No one was entirely sure, and he pointed out that either way, it was an unusual first name. A last name, sure. Elizabeth Arden, for example. Elaine recalled Eve Arden, the actress, who was before Wentworth\u0027s time. I pushed the button and we listened to the message again.\n \"It could be Auden,\" he said. \"Like the poet?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-32.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: \n Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) \n The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
