I\u0027m not going to say their names.\" \"All right.\" \"I\u0027m just not going to, not for the time being. They killed my parents, and somebody else killed them.\" She frowned. \"They were the ones who killed my parents, weren\u0027t they?\" \"One of them was.\" She hadn\u0027t said I couldn\u0027t say their names. \"Carl Ivanko. I\u0027m not sure about Bierman.\" \"The one who had the apartment.\" \"Right.\" \"And who shot the other one, and then killed himself, or at least that\u0027s what we were supposed to think. Wouldn\u0027t we have thought that anyway, even without the bolt?\" \"Yes.\" \"Because if you find two men dead like that, and it looks as though one of them shot the other one and then committed suicide, you\u0027d think that, wouldn\u0027t you?\" \"Yes. The bolt was just to be cute.\" \"Cute?\" \"Showing off,\" I said. \"Gilding the lily.\" \"I see. If he did it that way, though, killed them both and locked and bolted the door- \" \"Then how did he get out?\" \"That\u0027s what I was wondering. Through the window?\" I nodded. \"The windows were closed, but this was the ground floor. It wouldn\u0027t have been terribly difficult to climb out a window and close it after yourself. You couldn\u0027t engage the window locks, assuming they worked, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way to tell whether the windows were locked or not. The first thing the responding patrolmen would have done was open all the windows.\" \"Are they supposed to do that?\" \"No,\" I said, \"definitely not, but they were in a small apartment with two dead bodies that had been in there for several days, and I don\u0027t know a lot of cops who wouldn\u0027t have opened a window without thinking twice.\" \"So the locked bolt was supposed to prove one thing,\" she said, \"and instead it proves another.\" \"Prove\u0027s the wrong word,\" I said, \"because it doesn\u0027t really prove anything. It suggested something to me, but I was probably pretty suggestible. I went in there looking for something to be wrong.\" \"And the bolt was it.\" \"The bolt was part of it.\" \"What else?\" \"The way Ivanko was shot. Two in the torso, one in the head.\" \"The same as my father.\" \"Yes and no.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I don\u0027t want to be too graphic here,\" I said. \"I walked in,\" she said. \"I found them. You can be as graphic as you want.\" I said, \"Your father was shot from the front. Two bullets in the chest from a couple of feet away, then a third fired point-blank into his temple.\" \"He was probably already dead by then.\" Maybe, maybe not, but let her think so. \"Ivanko was shot from behind. Two bullets, one of which got the heart, both shots leaving powder burns on his shirt. Then the killer knelt down next to him and put a third bullet in his temple.\" \"So?\" \"The killer didn\u0027t want Ivanko to know what was coming. He deliberately took him by surprise, followed him into the bedroom and shot him in the back. That doesn\u0027t sound like somebody who just had a sudden attack of conscience, or a mental breakdown.\" \"Suppose he decided he just wanted to keep everything for himself?\" \"The score wasn\u0027t big enough to make anybody kill his partner in order to hog it all. The killing was done in a calculated manner, but it wasn\u0027t the act of a calculating man. And the ritual of three bullets, two in the back and one in the temple, was an obvious signature, but there was no real reason for it except as a signature. Why just two shots in the back? Why not empty the gun into him? The only reason that jumps out is that he\u0027d shot your father twice in the chest. He wanted to establish a pattern.\" \"A third man,\" she said. \"It sounds like a mole in a British spy novel. Or wasn\u0027t there an old movie with that title? An Orson Welles movie?\" \"That\u0027s the song,\" I said. \"I beg your pardon?\" \" \u0027The Third Man Theme,\u0027 \" I said, and hummed a couple of bars. \"It\u0027s been running around in my head for days now and I couldn\u0027t think what it was or how it got there.\" \"A message from your subconscious.\" \"I suppose so. Of course I\u0027d had the phrase in my mind for days. I\u0027d gotten used to thinking in terms of a third man.\" \"Still, there must be something the song\u0027s trying to tell you. Not to get sidetracked, maybe. To trust your own reasoning.\" \"That\u0027s possible. Or maybe the only way I could get the song out of my head was to remember what it was.\" \"Maybe. If there was a third man…\" \"Yes?\" \"Were there three of them here that night?\" \"No, I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Because the witness, the woman who thought they were going to do their laundry- \" \"Only saw two men.\" \"Yes.\" \"Eyewitnesses get things wrong,\" I said. \"But in this case I think she got the number right. There were just two men.\" \"And the third man was waiting for them? Wait a minute, he was the driver, wasn\u0027t he? He was waiting for them in the car, and drove them back to Brooklyn, and…\" Her words trailed off. I said, \"Finish the thought. The three of them walk into the Coney Island Avenue place. The third man shoots Ivanko three times, then kills Bierman in a way that looks like suicide, first getting him to strip to his underwear.\" \"His underwear?\" She hadn\u0027t known about that part, so I had to go back and fill in. Then I said, \"It would be awfully hard to manage. I think I might be able to come a little closer to what actually happened.\" She finished her coffee, put the cup down, sat up straight in her chair, and folded her hands on the table in front of her, waiting for me to explain. THIRTEEN Bierman was never in the house, I told her. Never on West Seventy-fourth Street, never anywhere near Manhattan the night of the murder. Bierman never left the apartment on Coney Island Avenue, and in fact he couldn\u0027t leave, because he was already dead. Sometime late that afternoon the third man pays Bierman a visit. He\u0027s been there before, and this time he brings along a bolt from the hardware store and the tools he\u0027ll need to install it. First, though, he manages to catch Bierman unawares. He overpowers him, or simply knocks him out. He strips Bierman down to his underwear, props him up in the corner of the room where he\u0027ll be least visible to someone entering the apartment, presses the butt of a little Italian automatic into his hand, sticks the business end of the gun in his mouth, wraps his own hand over Bierman\u0027s hand, and gives the trigger a squeeze. It\u0027s just one shot from a small gun, and there\u0027s not much likelihood anyone\u0027ll take any notice of it. It\u0027s a pistol, not a revolver, so he could even have a suppressor on it. But even without a suppressor it\u0027s not all that loud, and both their hands are clutching it, his and Bierman\u0027s, and that should muffle the report some. And it\u0027s not like it\u0027s a whole string of shots, and there\u0027s nobody screaming, no doors slamming. It\u0027s just one little gunshot, about as noisy as blowing up a paper bag and smashing it with your fist. But it\u0027s enough to kill Bierman. You\u0027d think he\u0027d be in a hurry to get out of there, but you\u0027d be wrong. He\u0027s pleased with himself, exhilarated by how well it went with Bierman. First thing he does is put on Bierman\u0027s shirt and pants. It might be messy later on, in fact he\u0027ll want to make sure it\u0027s messy later on, and wearing Bierman\u0027s clothes serves a double purpose, keeping his own clothes clean and providing some solid physical evidence for the cops. He leaves his own clothes in Bierman\u0027s closet, where they\u0027ll be handy later on. If Bierman\u0027s body is discovered before he can get back to the apartment, well, that\u0027ll be inconvenient, but nobody\u0027s going to look twice at his clothes in Bierman\u0027s closet. They\u0027ll look twice, or even three times, at the body in the corner, an obvious suicide, you\u0027d think, but what happened to the gun? Maybe they\u0027d decide it wasn\u0027t suicide, maybe they\u0027d figure someone else wandered in, found Bierman dead, and walked off with the gun. But the odds are nobody\u0027s going to find the body. He\u0027ll be back in a matter of hours, and then he\u0027ll be ready to return the gun to Bierman\u0027s hand. Until then, though, he has a use for it. But first he has that bolt he bought earlier, and a drill or an awl to make holes for the screws, and a screwdriver. It doesn\u0027t take him long to mount the bolt, and when he\u0027s finished he takes his tools with him and walks out the door, leaving the bolt unfastened and locking the door with the key- he\u0027s got Bierman\u0027s keys now, and he\u0027s wearing Bierman\u0027s shirt and jeans, and no neighbor\u0027s going to give him a second glance. Then, as arranged, he goes to meet Ivanko. Ivanko has never met Bierman, doesn\u0027t know Bierman exists. Ivanko knows he and his friend are going to pull a job, and there\u0027s money in it, and an opportunity to have some fun. The friend, the third man, drives. He has a car, although he may tell Ivanko it\u0027s stolen. He drives, and finds a place to park. He has a key to the house on West Seventy-fourth Street. As soon as he\u0027s inside he opens the closet door, where he keys in the code to deactivate the burglar alarm. They go through the house, and he guides Ivanko, tells him where to look, what to take. Meanwhile he holds the pillowcases so Ivanko can drop in the loot. That way he\u0027s not touching anything, not leaving his prints anywhere. He encourages Ivanko to be messy, dumping drawers, pawing through their contents, because he doesn\u0027t mind if Ivanko leaves prints here and there. But Ivanko\u0027s not entirely unprofessional, and may even be wearing surgical gloves. That\u0027s annoying, he\u0027d like a print or two left behind, but for the time being it can\u0027t be helped. Then they\u0027re done, and waiting for the Hollanders to return. Now he has to keep Ivanko eager to stick around for the last part. They\u0027ve got two sacks of money and valuables, and Ivanko would have to feel the natural impulse to get out while the getting\u0027s good, to take the money (and jewelry and silver) and run. She\u0027s pretty and she\u0027s hot-looking, he tells Ivanko, and you can have her and do anything you want to her. Anything you want, anything at all. Knows what to tell him, knows how to keep him right at the end of his leash. Then the Hollanders come home… And it\u0027s really not that difficult. He killed earlier that day, killed Bierman, and that went just as smooth as silk. He didn\u0027t mind doing it again. Sort of looked forward to it, actually, had been looking forward to it all along. Nothing tricky this time, no gun in the mouth, no hand clamped over Hollander\u0027s hand, because this is supposed to look like what it is, a murder committed by burglars. And so he shoots Byrne Hollander twice in the chest. For insurance (and perhaps because he likes it, pulling the trigger, feeling the little gun buck in his hand) he fires a third round into Hollander\u0027s temple. Smooth as silk, easy as pie. And it\u0027s time to let Ivanko off his leash. Take the gloves off, he tells him. You want to feel everything, don\u0027t you? Wearing gloves, be as stupid as wearing a rubber. You don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to catch AIDS from her, do you? Nice respectable married lady? Except Ivanko still doesn\u0027t leave prints, he\u0027s ripping cloth and grabbing skin, nothing that will take a print. Oh, he\u0027ll leave his DNA, but a set of prints would be so handy. If they knew who it was before they found the bodies…","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-17.html","bookId":2333,"book":{"id":2333,"title":"Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15)","description":"Storyline: Hope to Die (Matthew Scudder #15) The city caught its collective breath when upscale couple Byrne and Susan Hollander were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion.
