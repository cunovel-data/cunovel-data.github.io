{"id":23195,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"What happened was that a few days after they split, I was in the Art Room with some other girls, working on a still life. I remember it being stifling that day, even though we had the fan rattling behind us. We were using charcoal, and because someone had commandeered all the easels, we were having to work with our boards propped up on our laps. I was sitting beside Cynthia E., and we\u0027d just been chatting and complaining about the heat. Then somehow we\u0027d got onto the subject of boys, and she\u0027d said, not looking up from her work: \"And Tommy. I knew it wouldn\u0027t last with Ruth. Well, I suppose you\u0027re the natural successor.\" She\u0027d said it in a throwaway manner. But Cynthia was a perceptive person, and the fact that she wasn\u0027t part of our group just gave her remark more weight. What I mean is, I couldn\u0027t help thinking she represented what anyone with any distance on the subject would think. After all, I\u0027d been Tommy\u0027s friend for years until all this couples stuff had come up. It was perfectly possible that to someone on the outside, I\u0027d look like Ruth\u0027s \"natural successor.\" I just let it go, though, and Cynthia, who wasn\u0027t trying to make any big point, said nothing else about it. Then maybe a day or two later, I was coming out of the pavilion with Hannah when she suddenly nudged me and nodded towards a group of boys over on the North Playing Field. \"Look,\" she said quietly. \"Tommy. Sitting by himself.\" I shrugged, as though to say: \"So what?\" And that\u0027s all there was to it. But afterwards I found myself thinking a lot about it. Maybe all Hannah had meant to do was point out how Tommy, since splitting with Ruth, looked a bit of a spare part. But I couldn\u0027t quite buy this; I knew Hannah too well. The way she\u0027d nudged me and lowered her voice had made it all too obvious she too was expressing some assumption, probably doing the rounds, about me being the \"natural successor.\" All this did, as I say, put me in a bit of a confusion, because until then I\u0027d been all set on my Harry plan. In fact, looking back now, I\u0027m sure I would have had sex with Harry if it hadn\u0027t been for this \"natural successor\" business. I\u0027d had it all sorted, and my preparations had gone well. And I still think Harry was a good choice for that stage in my life. I think he would have been considerate and gentle, and have understood what I was wanting from him. I saw Harry fleetingly a couple of years ago at the recovery centre in Wiltshire. He was being brought in after a donation. I wasn\u0027t in the best of moods because my own donor had just completed the night before. No one was blaming me for that--it had been a particularly untidy operation--but I wasn\u0027t feeling great all the same. I\u0027d been up most of the night, sorting all the arrangements, and I was in the front reception getting ready to leave when I saw Harry coming in. He was in a wheelchair--because he was so weak, I found out later, not because he couldn\u0027t actually walk--and I\u0027m not sure he recognised me when I went up and said hello. I suppose there\u0027s no reason I should have any special place in his memory. We\u0027d never had much to do with each other apart from that one time. To him, if he remembered me at all, I\u0027d just be this daft girl who came up to him once, asked if he wanted sex, then backed off. He must have been pretty mature for his age, because he didn\u0027t get annoyed or go round telling people I was a tease, or any of that. So when I saw him being brought in that day, I felt grateful to him and wished I was his carer. I looked about, but whoever was his carer wasn\u0027t even around. The orderlies were impatient to get him to his room, so I didn\u0027t talk with him long. I just said hello, that I hoped he\u0027d feel better soon, and he smiled tiredly. When I mentioned Hailsham he did a thumbs-up, but I could tell he didn\u0027t recognise me. Maybe later, when he wasn\u0027t so tired, or when the medication wasn\u0027t so strong, he\u0027d have tried to place me and remembered. Anyway, I was talking about back then: about how after Ruth and Tommy split, all my plans got confused. Looking at it now, I feel a bit sorry for Harry. After all the hints I\u0027d been dropping the previous week, there I was, suddenly whispering stuff to put him off. I suppose I must have assumed he was raring to go, that I had my work cut out just to hold him off. Because whenever I saw him, I\u0027d always get something in quick, then rush off before he could say anything back. It was only much later, when I thought about it, it occurred to me he might not have had sex on his mind at all. For all I know, he might have been happy to forget the whole thing, except that every time he saw me, along a corridor or in the grounds, I\u0027d come up and whisper some excuse why I didn\u0027t want sex with him just then. It must have looked pretty daft from his side, and if he hadn\u0027t been such a decent type, I\u0027d have been a laughing stock in no time. Well, anyway, this era of putting Harry off lasted maybe a couple of weeks, and then came Ruth\u0027s request. THAT SUMMER, right up until the warm weather faded, we developed this odd way of listening to music together in the fields. Walkmans had started appearing at Hailsham since the previous year\u0027s Sales and by that summer there were at least six of them in circulation. The craze was for several people to sit on the grass around a single Walkman, passing the headset around. Okay, it sounds a stupid way to listen to music, but it created a really good feeling. You listened for maybe twenty seconds, took off the headset, passed it on. After a while, provided you kept the same tape going over and over, it was surprising how close it was to having heard all of it by yourself. As I say, the craze really took off that summer, and during the lunch breaks you\u0027d see all these clusters of students lying about the grass around the Walkmans. The guardians weren\u0027t too keen, saying we\u0027d spread ear infections, but they let us carry on. I can\u0027t remember that last summer without thinking about those afternoons around the Walkmans. Someone would wander up and ask: \"What\u0027s the sound?\" and if they liked the answer, they\u0027d sit down on the grass and wait their turn. There was almost always a good atmosphere around these sessions and I don\u0027t remember anyone being refused a share of the headset. Anyway, that\u0027s what I was up to with a few other girls when Ruth came up to ask if we could have a talk. I could tell it was something important, so I left my other friends and the two of us walked off, all the way to our dorm hut. When we got to our room, I sat down on Ruth\u0027s bed, close to the window--the sun had warmed the blanket--and she sat on mine over by the back wall. There was a bluebottle buzzing around, and for a minute we had a laugh playing \"bluebottle tennis,\" throwing our hands about to make the demented creature go from one to the other of us. Then it found its way out of the window, and Ruth said: \"I want me and Tommy to get back together again. Kathy, will you help?\" Then she asked: \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"Nothing. I was just a bit surprised, after what\u0027s happened. Of course I\u0027ll help.\" \"I haven\u0027t told anybody else about wanting to get back with Tommy. Not even Hannah. You\u0027re the only one I trust.\" \"What do you want me to do?\" \"Just talk to him. You\u0027ve always had this way with him. He\u0027ll listen to you. And he\u0027ll know you\u0027re not bullshitting about me.\" For a moment we sat there swinging our feet under our beds. \"It\u0027s really good you\u0027re telling me this,\" I said eventually. \"I probably am the best person. Talking to Tommy and all that.\" \"What I want is for us to make a fresh start. We\u0027re about evens now, we\u0027ve both done daft things just to hurt each other, but it\u0027s enough now. Martha bloody H., I ask you! Maybe he did it just to give me a good laugh. Well you can tell him he succeeded, and the scores are all even again. It\u0027s time we grew up and started afresh. I know you can reason with him, Kathy. You\u0027ll deal with it the best way possible. Then if he\u0027s still not prepared to be sensible, I\u0027ll know there\u0027s no point carrying on with him.\" I shrugged. \"As you say, Tommy and I, we\u0027ve always been able to talk.\" \"Yeah, and he really respects you. I know because he\u0027s often talked about it. How you\u0027ve got guts and how you always do what you say you\u0027re going to do. He told me once if he was in a corner, he\u0027d rather have you backing him than any of the boys.\" She did a quick laugh. \"Now you\u0027ve got to admit, that\u0027s a real compliment. So you see, it\u0027s got to be you to our rescue. Tommy and I were made for each other and he\u0027ll listen to you. You\u0027ll do it for us, won\u0027t you, Kathy?\" I didn\u0027t say anything for a moment. Then I asked: \"Ruth, are you serious about Tommy? I mean, if I do persuade him, and you get back together, you won\u0027t hurt him again?\" Ruth gave an impatient sigh. \"Of course I\u0027m serious. We\u0027re adults now. Soon we\u0027ll be leaving Hailsham. It\u0027s not a game any more.\" \"Okay. I\u0027ll talk to him. Like you say, we\u0027ll be leaving here soon. We can\u0027t afford to waste time.\" After that, I remember us sitting on those beds, talking for some time. Ruth wanted to go over everything again and again: how stupid he was being, why they were really suited to each other, how differently they\u0027d do things next time round, how they\u0027d keep much more private, how they\u0027d have sex in better places at better times. We talked about it all and she wanted my advice on everything. Then at one point, I was looking out of the window towards the hills in the distance, when I was startled to feel Ruth, suddenly beside me, squeeze my shoulders. \"Kathy, I knew we could depend on you,\" she said. \"Tommy\u0027s right. You\u0027re just the person to have when you\u0027re in a corner.\" WHAT WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER, I didn\u0027t get a chance to talk to Tommy for the next few days. Then one lunch-time I spotted him on the edge of the South Playing Field practising with his football. He\u0027d been having a kickabout earlier with two other boys, but now he was alone, juggling the ball about in the air. I went over and sat down on the grass behind him, putting my back against a fence post. This couldn\u0027t have been long after that time I\u0027d shown him Patricia C.\u0027s calendar and he\u0027d marched off, because I remember we weren\u0027t sure how we stood with each other. He went on with his ball-juggling, scowling with concentration--knee, foot, head, foot--while I sat there picking away at clovers and gazing at the woods in the distance that we\u0027d once been so frightened of. In the end I decided to break the deadlock and said: \"Tommy, let\u0027s talk now. There\u0027s something I want to talk to you about.\" As soon as I said this, he let the ball roll away and came to sit down beside me. It was typical of Tommy that once he knew I was willing to talk, there was suddenly no trace left of any sulkiness; just a kind of grateful eagerness that reminded me of the way we were back in the Juniors when a guardian who\u0027d been telling us off went back to being normal. He was panting a bit, and though I knew this was from the football, it added to his overall impression of eagerness. In other words, before we\u0027d said anything, he\u0027d already got my back up. Then when I said to him: \"Tommy, I can tell. You haven\u0027t been too happy lately,\" he said: \"What do you mean? I\u0027m perfectly happy. I really am.\" And he did a big beam, followed by this hearty laugh. That was what did it. Years later, when I saw a shadow of it every now and then, I\u0027d just smile. But back then, it really used to get to me. If Tommy happened to say to you: \"I\u0027m really upset about it,\" he\u0027d have to put on a long, downcast face, then and there, to back up his words. I don\u0027t mean he did this ironically. He actually thought he\u0027d be more convincing. So now, to prove he was happy, here he was, trying to sparkle with bonhomie. As I say, there would come a time when I\u0027d think this was sweet; but that summer all I could see was that it advertised what a child he still was, and how easily you could take advantage of him. I didn\u0027t know much then about the world that awaited us beyond Hailsham, but I\u0027d guessed we\u0027d need all our wits about us, and when Tommy did anything like this, I felt something close to panic. Until that afternoon I\u0027d always let it go--it always seemed too difficult to explain--but this time I burst out, saying: \"Tommy, you look so stupid, laughing like that! If you want to pretend you\u0027re happy, you don\u0027t do it that way! Just take it from me, you don\u0027t do it that way! You definitely don\u0027t! Look, you\u0027ve got to grow up. And you\u0027ve got to get yourself back on track. Everything\u0027s been falling apart for you just lately, and we both know why.\" Tommy was looking puzzled. When he was sure I\u0027d finished, he said: \"You\u0027re right. Things have been falling apart for me. But I don\u0027t see what you mean, Kath. What do you mean, we both know? I don\u0027t see how you could know. I haven\u0027t told anyone.\" \"Obviously I don\u0027t have all the details. But we all know about you splitting with Ruth.\" Tommy still looked puzzled. Finally he did another little laugh, but this time it was a real one. \"I see what you mean,\" he mumbled, then paused a moment to think something over. \"To be honest, Kath,\" he said eventually, \"that\u0027s not really what\u0027s bothering me. It\u0027s really something else altogether. I just keep thinking about it all the time. About Miss Lucy.\" And that was how I came to hear about it, about what had happened between Tommy and Miss Lucy at the start of that summer. Later, when I\u0027d had time to think it over, I worked out it must have happened no more than a few days after the morning I\u0027d seen Miss Lucy up in Room 22 scrawling over her paperwork. And like I said, I felt like kicking myself I hadn\u0027t found out from him earlier. It had been in the afternoon near the \"dead hour\"--when the lessons were finished but there was still some time to go until supper. Tommy had seen Miss Lucy coming out of the main house, her arms loaded with flipcharts and box files, and because it looked like she\u0027d drop something any moment, he\u0027d run over and offered to help. \"Well, she gave me a few things to carry and said we were headed back to her study with it all. Even between the two of us there was too much and I dropped a couple of things on the way. Then when we were coming up to the Orangery, she suddenly stopped, and I thought she\u0027d dropped something else. But she was looking at me, like this, straight in the face, all serious. Then she says we\u0027ve got to have a talk, a good talk. I say fine, and so we go into the Orangery, into her study, put all the stuff down. And she tells me to sit down, and I end up exactly where I was the last time, you know, that time years ago. And I can tell she\u0027s remembering that time as well, because she starts talking about it like it was only the day before. No explanations, nothing, she just starts off saying something like: ‘Tommy, I made a mistake, when I said what I did to you. And I should have put you right about it long before now.\u0027 Then she\u0027s saying I should forget everything she told me before. That she\u0027d done me a big disservice telling me not to worry about being creative. That the other guardians had been right all along, and there was no excuse for my art being so rubbish...\" \"Hold on, Tommy. Did she actually say your art was ‘rubbish?\u0027 \" \"If it wasn\u0027t ‘rubbish\u0027 it was something like it. Negligible. That might have been it. Or incompetent. She might as well have said rubbish. She said she was sorry she\u0027d told me what she had the last time because if she hadn\u0027t, I might have sorted it all by now.\" \"What were you saying through all this?\" \"I didn\u0027t know what to say. In the end, she actually asked. She said: ‘Tommy, what are you thinking?\u0027 So I said I wasn\u0027t sure but that she shouldn\u0027t worry either way because I was all right now. And she said, no, I wasn\u0027t all right. My art was rubbish, and that was partly her fault for telling me what she had. And I said to her, but what does it matter? I\u0027m all right now, no one laughs at me about that any more. But she keeps shaking her head saying: ‘It does matter. I shouldn\u0027t have said what I did.\u0027 So it occurs to me she\u0027s talking about later, you know, about after we leave here. So I say: ‘But I\u0027ll be all right, Miss. I\u0027m really fit, I know how to look after myself. When it\u0027s time for donations, I\u0027ll be able to do it really well.\u0027 When I said this, she starts shaking her head, shaking it really hard so I\u0027m worried she\u0027ll get dizzy. Then she says: ‘Listen, Tommy, your art, it is important. And not just because it\u0027s evidence. But for your own sake. You\u0027ll get a lot from it, just for yourself.\u0027 \" \"Hold on. What did she mean, ‘evidence\u0027?\" \"I don\u0027t know. But she definitely said that. She said our art was important, and ‘not just because it\u0027s evidence.\u0027 God knows what she meant. I did actually ask her, when she said that. I said I didn\u0027t understand what she was telling me, and was it something to do with Madame and her gallery? And she did a big sigh and said: ‘Madame\u0027s gallery, yes, that\u0027s important. Much more important than I once thought. I see that now.\u0027 Then she said: ‘Look, there are all kinds of things you don\u0027t understand, Tommy, and I can\u0027t tell you about them. Things about Hailsham, about your place in the wider world, all kinds of things. But perhaps one day, you\u0027ll try and find out. They won\u0027t make it easy for you, but if you want to, really want to, you might find out.\u0027 She started shaking her head again after that, though not as bad as before, and she says: ‘But why should you be any different? The students who leave here, they never find out much. Why should you be any different?\u0027 I didn\u0027t know what she was talking about, so I just said again: ‘I\u0027ll be all right, Miss.\u0027 She was quiet for a time, then she suddenly stood up and kind of bent over me and hugged me. Not in a sexy way. More like they used to do when we were little. I just kept as still as possible. Then she stood back and said again she was sorry for what she\u0027d told me before. And that it wasn\u0027t too late, I should start straight away, making up the lost time. I don\u0027t think I said anything, and she looked at me and I thought she\u0027d hug me again. But instead she said: ‘Just do it for my sake, Tommy.\u0027 I told her I\u0027d do my best, because by then I just wanted out of there. I was probably bright scarlet, what with her hugging me and everything. I mean, it\u0027s not the same, is it, now we\u0027ve got bigger.\" Until this point I\u0027d been so engrossed in Tommy\u0027s story, I\u0027d forgotten my reason for having this talk with him. But this reference to our getting \"bigger\" reminded me of my original mission. \"Look, Tommy,\" I said, \"we\u0027ll have to talk this over carefully soon. It\u0027s really interesting and I can see how it must have made you miserable. But either way, you\u0027re going to have to pull yourself together a bit more. We\u0027re going to be leaving here this summer. You\u0027ve got to get yourself sorted again, and there\u0027s one thing you can straighten out right now. Ruth told me she\u0027s prepared to call it quits and have you get back with her again. I think that\u0027s a good chance for you. Don\u0027t mess it up.\" He was quiet for a few seconds, then said: \"I don\u0027t know, Kath. There are all these other things to think about.\" \"Tommy, just listen. You\u0027re really lucky. Of all the people here, you\u0027ve got Ruth fancying you. After we leave, if you\u0027re with her, you won\u0027t have to worry. She\u0027s the best, you\u0027ll be fine so long as you\u0027re with her. She\u0027s saying she wants a fresh start. So don\u0027t blow it.\" I waited but Tommy gave no response, and again I felt something like panic coming over me. I leaned forward and said: \"Look, you fool, you\u0027re not going to get many more chances. Don\u0027t you realise, we won\u0027t be here together like this much longer?\" To my surprise Tommy\u0027s response, when it came, was calm and considered--the side of Tommy that was to emerge more and more in the years ahead. \"I do realise that, Kath. That\u0027s exactly why I can\u0027t rush back into it with Ruth. We\u0027ve got to think about the next move really carefully.\" Then he sighed and looked right at me. \"Like you say, Kath. We\u0027re going to be leaving here soon. It\u0027s not like a game any more. We\u0027ve got to think carefully.\" I was suddenly lost for what to say and just sat there tugging away at the clovers. I could feel his eyes on me, but I didn\u0027t look up. We might have gone on that way for a while longer, except we were interrupted. I think the boys he\u0027d been playing football with earlier came back, or maybe it was some students strolling by who came and sat down with us. Anyway, our little heart-to-heart was at an end and I came away feeling I hadn\u0027t done what I\u0027d set out to do--that I\u0027d somehow let Ruth down. f I NEVER GOT TO ASSESS WHAT KIND of impact my talk with Tommy had had, because it was the very next day the news broke. It was midway through the morning and we\u0027d been in yet another Culture Briefing. These were classes where we had to role play various people we\u0027d find out there--waiters in cafés, policemen and so on. The sessions always got us excited and worried all at the same time, so we were pretty keyed up anyway. Then at the end of the lesson, as we were filing out, Charlotte F. came rushing into the room and the news about Miss Lucy leaving Hailsham spread through us in an instant. Mr. Chris, who\u0027d been taking the class and who must have known all along, shuffled off guiltily before we could ask him anything. At first we weren\u0027t sure if Charlotte was just reporting a rumour, but the more she told us, the clearer it became this was for real. Earlier in the morning, one of the other Senior classes had gone into Room 12 expecting Music Appreciation with Miss Lucy. But Miss Emily had been there instead and she\u0027d told them Miss Lucy couldn\u0027t come just at that moment, so she would take the class. For the next twenty minutes or so everything had gone quite normally. Then suddenly--right in mid-sentence, apparently--Miss Emily had broken off from talking about Beethoven and announced that Miss Lucy had left Hailsham and wouldn\u0027t be returning. That class had finished several minutes early--Miss Emily had rushed off with a preoccupied frown--and the word had started to go round as soon as the students had come out. I immediately set off to look for Tommy, because I desperately wanted him to hear it first from me. But when I stepped into the courtyard, I saw I was too late. There was Tommy, over on the far side, on the edge of a circle of boys, nodding to what was being said. The other boys were animated, maybe excited even, but Tommy\u0027s eyes looked empty. That very evening, Tommy and Ruth got back together again, and I remember Ruth finding me a few days later to thank me for \"sorting it all out so well.\" I told her I probably hadn\u0027t helped much, but she was having none of that. I was most definitely in her good books. And that was more or less the way things stayed throughout our last days at Hailsham.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372/911.html","bookId":311,"book":{"id":311,"title":"别让我走 Never let me go","description":"简介： 一段令人心碎、惴惴不安的爱情故事，勾勒出一幅阐明人性的脆弱与希望、寻找乡关何处的宿命风景，而在平凡寻常文字间，呈现惊人真相的悬疑推理画面 海尔森表面上看来是一所迷人...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110906/1-110Z6102914c2.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
