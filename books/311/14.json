{"id":23200,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"When I got outside, it was obvious the excitement from when we\u0027d first arrived had evaporated completely. We walked in silence, Rodney leading the way, through little backstreets hardly penetrated by the sun, the pavements so narrow we often had to shuffle along in single file. It was a relief to come out onto the High Street where the noise made our rotten mood less obvious. As we crossed at a pelican to the sunnier side, I could see Rodney and Chrissie conferring about something and I wondered how much of the bad atmosphere had to do with their believing we were holding back on some big Hailsham secret, and how much was just to do with Ruth\u0027s having a go at Tommy. Then once we\u0027d crossed the High Street, Chrissie announced she and Rodney wanted to go shopping for birthday cards. Ruth was stunned by this, but Chrissie just went on: \"We like buying them in big batches. It\u0027s always cheaper in the long run. And you\u0027ve always got one handy when it\u0027s someone\u0027s birthday.\" She pointed to the entrance of a Woolworth\u0027s shop. \"You can get pretty good cards in there really cheap.\" Rodney was nodding, and I thought there was something a little bit mocking around the edges of his smile. \"Of course,\" he said, \"you end up with a lot of cards the same, but you can put your own illustrations on them. You know, personalise them.\" Both veterans were now standing in the middle of the pavement, letting people with pushchairs move round them, waiting for us to put up a challenge. I could tell Ruth was furious, but without Rodney\u0027s co-operation there wasn\u0027t much that could be done anyway. So we went into the Woolworth\u0027s, and immediately I felt much more cheerful. Even now, I like places like that: a large store with lots of aisles displaying bright plastic toys, greeting cards, loads of cosmetics, maybe even a photo booth. Today, if I\u0027m in a town and find myself with some time to kill, I\u0027ll stroll into somewhere just like that, where you can hang around and enjoy yourself, not buying a thing, and the assistants don\u0027t mind at all. Anyway, we went in and before long we\u0027d wandered apart to look at different aisles. Rodney had stayed near the entrance beside a big rack of cards, and further inside, I spotted Tommy under a big pop-group poster, rummaging through the music cassettes. After about ten minutes, when I was somewhere near the back of the store, I thought I heard Ruth\u0027s voice and wandered towards it. I\u0027d already turned into the aisle--one with fluffy animals and big boxed jigsaws--before I realised Ruth and Chrissie were standing together at the end of it, having some sort of tête-à-tête. I wasn\u0027t sure what to do: I didn\u0027t want to interrupt, but it was time we were leaving and I didn\u0027t want to turn and walk off again. So I just stopped where I was, pretended to examine a jigsaw and waited for them to notice me. That was when I realised they were back on the subject of this rumour. Chrissie was saying, in a lowered voice, something like: \"But all that time you were there, I\u0027m amazed you didn\u0027t think more about how you\u0027d do it. About who you\u0027d go to, all of that.\" \"You don\u0027t understand,\" Ruth was saying. \"If you were from Hailsham, then you\u0027d see. It\u0027s never been such a big deal for us. I suppose we\u0027ve always known if we ever wanted to look into it, all we\u0027d have to do is get word back to Hailsham...\" Ruth saw me and broke off. When I lowered the jigsaw and turned to them, they were both looking at me angrily. At the same time, it was like I\u0027d caught them doing something they shouldn\u0027t, and they moved apart self-consciously. \"It\u0027s time we were off,\" I said, pretending to have heard nothing. But Ruth wasn\u0027t fooled. As they came past, she gave me a really dirty look. So by the time we set off again, following Rodney in search of the office where he\u0027d seen Ruth\u0027s possible the month before, the atmosphere between us was worse than ever. Things weren\u0027t helped either by Rodney repeatedly taking us down the wrong streets. At least four times, he led us confidently down a turning off the High Street, only for the shops and offices to run out, and we\u0027d have to turn and come back. Before long, Rodney was looking defensive and on the verge of giving up. But then we found it. Again, we\u0027d turned and were heading back towards the High Street, when Rodney had stopped suddenly. Then he\u0027d indicated silently an office on the other side of the street. There it was, sure enough. It wasn\u0027t exactly like the magazine advert we\u0027d found on the ground that day, but then it wasn\u0027t so far off either. There was a big glass front at street-level, so anyone going by could see right into it: a large open-plan room with maybe a dozen desks arranged in irregular L-patterns. There were the potted palms, the shiny machines and swooping desk lamps. People were moving about between desks, or leaning on a partition, chatting and sharing jokes, while others had pulled their swivel chairs close to each other and were enjoying a coffee and sandwich. \"Look,\" Tommy said. \"It\u0027s their lunch break, but they don\u0027t go out. Don\u0027t blame them either.\" We kept on staring, and it looked like a smart, cosy, self-contained world. I glanced at Ruth and noticed her eyes moving anxiously around the faces behind the glass. \"Okay, Rod,\" Chrissie said. \"So which one\u0027s the possible?\" She said this almost sarcastically, like she was sure the whole thing would turn out to be a big mistake on his part. But Rodney said quietly, with a tremor of excitement: \"There. Over in that corner. In the blue outfit. Her, talking now to the big red woman.\" It wasn\u0027t obvious, but the longer we kept looking, the more it seemed he had something. The woman was around fifty, and had kept her figure pretty well. Her hair was darker than Ruth\u0027s--though it could have been dyed--and she had it tied back in a simple pony-tail the way Ruth usually did. She was laughing at something her friend in the red outfit was saying, and her face, especially when she was finishing her laugh with a shake of her head, had more than a hint of Ruth about it. We all kept on watching her, not saying a word. Then we became aware that in another part of the office, a couple of the other women had noticed us. One raised a hand and gave us an uncertain wave. This broke the spell and we took to our heels in giggly panic. WE STOPPED AGAIN FURTHER DOWN THE STREET, talking excitedly all at once. Except for Ruth, that is, who remained silent in the middle of it. It was hard to read her face at that moment: she certainly wasn\u0027t disappointed, but then she wasn\u0027t elated either. She had on a half-smile, the sort a mother might have in an ordinary family, weighing things up while the children jumped and screamed around her asking her to say, yes, they could do whatever. So there we were, all coming out with our views, and I was glad I could say honestly, along with the others, that the woman we\u0027d seen was by no means out of the question. The truth was, we were all relieved: without quite realising it, we\u0027d been bracing ourselves for a let-down. But now we could go back to the Cottages, Ruth could take encouragement from what she\u0027d seen, and the rest of us could back her up. And the office life the woman appeared to be leading was about as close as you could hope to the one Ruth had often described for herself. Regardless of what had been going on between us that day, deep down, none of us wanted Ruth to return home despondent, and at that moment we thought we were safe. And so we would have been, I\u0027m pretty sure, had we put an end to the matter at that point. But then Ruth said: \"Let\u0027s sit over there, over on that wall. Just for a few minutes. Once they\u0027ve forgotten about us, we can go and have another look.\" We agreed to this, but as we walked towards the low wall around the small car park Ruth had indicated, Chrissie said, perhaps a little too eagerly: \"But even if we don\u0027t get to see her again, we\u0027re all agreed she\u0027s a possible. And it\u0027s a lovely office. It really is.\" \"Let\u0027s just wait a few minutes,\" Ruth said. \"Then we\u0027ll go back.\" I didn\u0027t sit on the wall myself because it was damp and crumbling, and because I thought someone might appear any minute and shout at us for sitting there. But Ruth did sit on it, knees on either side like she was astride a horse. And today I have these vivid images of the ten, fifteen minutes we waited there. No one\u0027s talking about the possible any more. We\u0027re pretending instead that we\u0027re just killing a bit of time, maybe at a scenic spot during a carefree day-trip. Rodney\u0027s doing a little dance to demonstrate what a good feeling there is. He gets up on the wall, balances along it then deliberately falls off. Tommy\u0027s making jokes about some passers-by, and though they\u0027re not very funny, we\u0027re all laughing. Just Ruth, in the middle, astride the wall, remains silent. She keeps the smile on her face, but hardly moves. There\u0027s a breeze messing up her hair, and the bright winter sun\u0027s making her crinkle up her eyes, so you\u0027re not sure if she\u0027s smiling at our antics, or just grimacing in the light. These are the pictures I\u0027ve kept of those moments we waited by that car park. I suppose we were waiting for Ruth to decide when it was time to go back for a second look. Well, she never got to make that decision because of what happened next. Tommy, who had been mucking about on the wall with Rodney, suddenly jumped down and went still. Then he said: \"That\u0027s her. That\u0027s the same one.\" We all stopped what we were doing and watched the figure coming from the direction of the office. She was now wearing a cream-coloured overcoat, and struggling to fasten her briefcase as she walked. The buckle was giving her trouble, so she kept slowing down and starting again. We went on watching her in a kind of trance as she went past on the other side. Then as she was turning into the High Street, Ruth leapt up and said: \"Let\u0027s see where she goes.\" We came out of our trance and were off after her. In fact, Chrissie had to remind us to slow down or someone would think we were a gang of muggers going after the woman. We followed along the High Street at a reasonable distance, giggling, dodging past people, separating and coming together again. It must have been around two o\u0027clock by then, and the pavement was busy with shoppers. At times we nearly lost sight of her, but we kept up, loitering in front of window displays when she went into a shop, squeezing past pushchairs and old people when she came out again. Then the woman turned off the High Street into the little lanes near the seafront. Chrissie was worried she\u0027d notice us away from the crowds, but Ruth just kept going, and we followed behind her. Eventually we came into a narrow side-street that had the occasional shop, but was mainly just ordinary houses. We had to walk again in single file, and once when a van came the other way, we had to press ourselves into the houses to let it pass. Before long there was only the woman and us in the entire street, and if she\u0027d glanced back, there was no way she wouldn\u0027t have noticed us. But she just kept walking, a dozen or so steps ahead, then went in through a door--into \"The Portway Studios.\" I\u0027ve been back to the Portway Studios a number of times since then. It changed owners a few years ago and now sells all kinds of arty things: pots, plates, clay animals. Back then, it was two big white rooms just with paintings--beautifully displayed with plenty of spaces between them. The wooden sign hanging over the door is still the same one though. Anyway, we decided to go in after Rodney pointed out how suspicious we looked in that quiet little street. Inside the shop, we could at least pretend we were looking at the pictures. We came in to find the woman we\u0027d been following talking to a much older woman with silver hair, who seemed to be in charge of the place. They were sitting on either side of a small desk near the door, and apart from them, the gallery was empty. Neither woman paid much attention as we filed past, spread out and tried to look fascinated by the pictures. Actually, preoccupied though I was with Ruth\u0027s possible, I did begin to enjoy the paintings and the sheer peacefulness of the place. It felt like we\u0027d come a hundred miles from the High Street. The walls and ceilings were peppermint, and here and there, you\u0027d see a bit of fishing net, or a rotted piece from a boat stuck up high near the cornicing. The paintings too--mostly oils in deep blues and greens--had sea themes. Maybe it was the tiredness suddenly catching up with us--after all, we\u0027d been travelling since before dawn--but I wasn\u0027t the only one who went off into a bit of a dream in there. We\u0027d all wandered into different corners, and were staring at one picture after another, only occasionally making the odd hushed remark like: \"Come and look at this!\" All the time, we could hear Ruth\u0027s possible and the silver-haired lady talking on and on. They weren\u0027t especially loud, but in that place, their voices seemed to fill the entire space. They were discussing some man they both knew, how he didn\u0027t have a clue with his children. And as we kept listening to them, stealing the odd glance in their direction, bit by bit, something started to change. It did for me, and I could tell it was happening for the others. If we\u0027d left it at seeing the woman through the glass of her office, even if we\u0027d followed her through the town then lost her, we could still have gone back to the Cottages excited and triumphant. But now, in that gallery, the woman was too close, much closer than we\u0027d ever really wanted. And the more we heard her and looked at her, the less she seemed like Ruth. It was a feeling that grew among us almost tangibly, and I could tell that Ruth, absorbed in a picture on the other side of the room, was feeling it as much as anyone. That was probably why we went on shuffling around that gallery for so long; we were delaying the moment when we\u0027d have to confer. Then suddenly the woman had left, and we all kept standing about, avoiding each other\u0027s eyes. But none of us had thought to follow the woman, and as the seconds kept ticking on, it became like we were agreeing, without speaking, about how we now saw the situation. Eventually the silver-haired lady came out from behind her desk and said to Tommy, who was the nearest to her: \"That\u0027s a particularly lovely work. That one\u0027s a favourite of mine.\" Tommy turned to her and let out a laugh. Then as I was hurrying over to help him out, the lady asked: \"Are you art students?\" \"Not exactly,\" I said before Tommy could respond. \"We\u0027re just, well, keen.\" The silver-haired lady beamed, then started to tell us how the artist whose work we were looking at was related to her, and all about the artist\u0027s career thus far. This had the effect, at least, of breaking the trance-like state we\u0027d been in, and we gathered round her to listen, the way we might have done at Hailsham when a guardian started to speak. This really got the silver-haired lady going, and we kept nodding and exclaiming while she talked about where the paintings had been done, the times of day the artist liked to work, how some had been done without sketches. Then there came a kind of natural end to her lecture, and we all gave a sigh, thanked her and went out. The street outside being so narrow, we couldn\u0027t talk properly for a while longer, and I think we were all grateful for that. As we walked away from the gallery in single file, I could see Rodney, up at the front, theatrically stretching out his arms, like he was exhilarated the way he\u0027d been when we\u0027d first arrived in the town. But it wasn\u0027t convincing, and once we came out onto a wider street, we all shuffled to a halt. We were once again near a cliff edge. And like before, if you peered over the rail, you could see the paths zigzagging down to the seafront, except this time you could see the promenade at the bottom with rows of boarded-up stalls. We spent a few moments just looking out, letting the wind hit us. Rodney was still trying to be cheerful, like he\u0027d decided not to let any of this business spoil a good outing. He was pointing out to Chrissie something in the sea, way off on the horizon. But Chrissie turned away from him and said: \"Well, I think we\u0027re agreed, aren\u0027t we? That isn\u0027t Ruth.\" She gave a small laugh and laid a hand on Ruth\u0027s shoulder. \"I\u0027m sorry. We\u0027re all sorry. But we can\u0027t blame Rodney really. It wasn\u0027t that wild a try. You\u0027ve got to admit, when we saw her through those windows, it did look...\" She trailed off, then touched Ruth on the shoulder again. Ruth said nothing, but gave a little shrug, almost as if to shrug off the touch. She was squinting into the distance, at the sky rather than the water. I could tell she was upset, but someone who didn\u0027t know her well might well have supposed she was being thoughtful. \"Sorry, Ruth,\" Rodney said, and he too gave Ruth a pat on the shoulder. But he had a smile on his face like he didn\u0027t expect for one moment to be blamed for anything. It was the way someone apologised when they\u0027d tried to do you a favour, but it hadn\u0027t worked out. Watching Chrissie and Rodney at that moment, I remember thinking, yes, they were okay. They were kind in their way and were trying to cheer Ruth up. At the same time, though, I remember feeling--even though they were the ones doing the talking, and Tommy and I were silent--a sort of resentment towards them on Ruth\u0027s behalf. Because however sympathetic they were, I could see that deep down they were relieved. They were relieved things had turned out the way they had; that they were in a position to comfort Ruth, instead of being left behind in the wake of a dizzying boost to her hopes. They were relieved they wouldn\u0027t have to face, more starkly than ever, the notion which fascinated and nagged and scared them: this notion of theirs that there were all kinds of possibilities open to us Hailsham students that weren\u0027t open to them. I remember thinking then how different they actually were, Chrissie and Rodney, from the three of us. Then Tommy said: \"I don\u0027t see what difference it makes. It was just a bit of fun we were having.\" \"A bit of fun for you maybe, Tommy,\" Ruth said coldly, still gazing straight ahead of her. \"You wouldn\u0027t think so if it was your possible we\u0027d been looking for.\" \"I think I would,\" Tommy said. \"I don\u0027t see how it matters. Even if you found your possible, the actual model they got you from. Even then, I don\u0027t see what difference it makes to anything.\" \"Thank you for your profound contribution, Tommy,\" said Ruth. \"But I think Tommy\u0027s right,\" I said. \"It\u0027s daft to assume you\u0027ll have the same sort of life as your model. I agree with Tommy. It\u0027s just a bit of fun. We shouldn\u0027t get so serious about it.\" I too reached out and touched Ruth on the shoulder. I wanted her to feel the contrast to when Chrissie and Rodney had touched her, and I deliberately chose exactly the same spot. I expected some response, some signal that she accepted understanding from me and Tommy in a way she didn\u0027t from the veterans. But she gave me nothing, not even the shrug she\u0027d given Chrissie. Somewhere behind me I could hear Rodney pacing about, making noises to suggest he was getting chilly in the strong wind. \"How about going to visit Martin now?\" he said. \"His flat\u0027s just over there, behind those houses.\" Ruth suddenly sighed and turned to us. \"To be honest,\" she said, \"I knew all along it was stupid.\" \"Yeah,\" said Tommy, eagerly. \"Just a bit of fun.\" Ruth gave him an irritated look. \"Tommy, please shut up with all this ‘bit of fun\u0027 stuff. No one\u0027s listening.\" Then turning to Chrissie and Rodney she went on: \"I didn\u0027t want to say when you first told me about this. But look, it was never on. They don\u0027t ever, ever, use people like that woman. Think about it. Why would she want to? We all know it, so why don\u0027t we all face it. We\u0027re not modelled from that sort...\" \"Ruth,\" I cut in firmly. \"Ruth, don\u0027t.\" But she just carried on: \"We all know it. We\u0027re modelled from trash. Junkies, prostitutes, winos, tramps. Convicts, maybe, just so long as they aren\u0027t psychos. That\u0027s what we come from. We all know it, so why don\u0027t we say it? A woman like that? Come on. Yeah, right, Tommy. A bit of fun. Let\u0027s have a bit of fun pretending. That other woman in there, her friend, the old one in the gallery. Art students, that\u0027s what she thought we were. Do you think she\u0027d have talked to us like that if she\u0027d known what we really were? What do you think she\u0027d have said if we\u0027d asked her? ‘Excuse me, but do you think your friend was ever a clone model?\u0027 She\u0027d have thrown us out. We know it, so we might as well just say it. If you want to look for possibles, if you want to do it properly, then you look in the gutter. You look in rubbish bins. Look down the toilet, that\u0027s where you\u0027ll find where we all came from.\" \"Ruth\"--Rodney\u0027s voice was steady and had a warning in it--\"let\u0027s forget about it and go and see Martin. He\u0027s off this afternoon. You\u0027ll like him, he\u0027s a real laugh.\" Chrissie put an arm around Ruth. \"Come on, Ruth. Let\u0027s do what Rodney says.\" Ruth got to her feet and Rodney started to walk. \"Well, you lot can go,\" I said quietly. \"I\u0027m not going.\" Ruth turned and looked at me carefully. \"Well, what do you know? Who\u0027s the upset one now?\" \"I\u0027m not upset. But sometimes you speak garbage, Ruth.\" \"Oh, look who\u0027s upset now. Poor Kathy. She never likes straight talking.\" \"It\u0027s nothing to do with that. I don\u0027t want to visit a carer. We\u0027re not supposed to and I don\u0027t even know this guy.\" Ruth shrugged and exchanged glances with Chrissie. \"Well,\" she said, \"there\u0027s no reason we\u0027ve got to go round together the whole time. If little Miss here doesn\u0027t want to join us, she doesn\u0027t have to. Let her go off by herself.\" Then she leaned over to Chrissie and said in a stage whisper: \"That\u0027s always the best way when Kathy\u0027s in a mood. Leave her alone and she\u0027ll walk it off.\" \"Be back at the car by four o\u0027clock,\" Rodney said to me. \"Otherwise you\u0027ll have to hitch-hike.\" Then he did a laugh. \"Come on, Kathy, don\u0027t get in a sulk. Come with us.\" \"No. You go on. I don\u0027t feel like it.\" Rodney shrugged and started to move off again. Ruth and Chrissie followed, but Tommy didn\u0027t move. Only when Ruth stared at him did he say: \"I\u0027ll stay with Kath. If we\u0027re splitting, then I\u0027ll stay with Kath.\" Ruth glared at him in fury, then turned and strode off. Chrissie and Rodney looked at Tommy awkwardly, then they too began walking again.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372/916.html","bookId":311,"book":{"id":311,"title":"别让我走 Never let me go","description":"简介： 一段令人心碎、惴惴不安的爱情故事，勾勒出一幅阐明人性的脆弱与希望、寻找乡关何处的宿命风景，而在平凡寻常文字间，呈现惊人真相的悬疑推理画面 海尔森表面上看来是一所迷人...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110906/1-110Z6102914c2.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
