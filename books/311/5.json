{"id":23191,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"I\u0027m not sure for how long the \"secret guard\" business carried on. When Ruth and I discussed it while I was caring for her down in Dover, she claimed it had been just a matter of two or three weeks--but that was almost certainly wrong. She was probably embarrassed about it and so the whole thing had shrunk in her memory. My guess is that it went on for about nine months, a year even, around when we were seven, going on eight.\\n\\n I was never sure if Ruth had actually invented the secret guard herself, but there was no doubt she was the leader. There were between six and ten of us, the figure changing whenever Ruth allowed in a new member or expelled someone. We believed Miss Geraldine was the best guardian in Hailsham, and we worked on presents to give her--a large sheet with pressed flowers glued over it comes to mind. But our main reason for existing, of course, was to protect her.\\n\\n By the time I joined the guard, Ruth and the others had already known for ages about the plot to kidnap Miss Geraldine. We were never quite sure who was behind it. We sometimes suspected certain of the Senior boys, sometimes boys in our own year. There was a guardian we didn\u0027t like much--a Miss Eileen--who we thought for a while might be the brains behind it. We didn\u0027t know when the abduction would take place, but one thing we felt convinced about was that the woods would come into it.\\n\\n The woods were at the top of the hill that rose behind Hailsham House. All we could see really was a dark fringe of trees, but I certainly wasn\u0027t the only one of my age to feel their presence day and night. When it got bad, it was like they cast a shadow over the whole of Hailsham; all you had to do was turn your head or move towards a window and there they\u0027d be, looming in the distance. Safest was the front of the main house, because you couldn\u0027t see them from any of the windows. Even so, you never really got away from them.\\n\\n There were all kinds of horrible stories about the woods. Once, not so long before we all got to Hailsham, a boy had had a big row with his friends and run off beyond the Hailsham boundaries. His body had been found two days later, up in those woods, tied to a tree with the hands and feet chopped off. Another rumour had it that a girl\u0027s ghost wandered through those trees. She\u0027d been a Hailsham student until one day she\u0027d climbed over a fence just to see what it was like outside. This was a long time before us, when the guardians were much stricter, cruel even, and when she tried to get back in, she wasn\u0027t allowed. She kept hanging around outside the fences, pleading to be let back in, but no one let her. Eventually, she\u0027d gone off somewhere out there, something had happened and she\u0027d died. But her ghost was always wandering about the woods, gazing over Hailsham, pining to be let back in.\\n\\n The guardians always insisted these stories were nonsense. But then the older students would tell us that was exactly what the guardians had told them when they were younger, and that we\u0027d be told the ghastly truth soon enough, just as they were.\\n\\n The woods played on our imaginations the most after dark, in our dorms as we were trying to fall asleep. You almost thought then you could hear the wind rustling the branches, and talking about it seemed to only make things worse. I remember one night, when we were furious with Marge K.--she\u0027d done something really embarrassing to us during the day--we chose to punish her by hauling her out of bed, holding her face against the window pane and ordering her to look up at the woods. At first she kept her eyes screwed shut, but we twisted her arms and forced open her eyelids until she saw the distant outline against the moonlit sky, and that was enough to ensure for her a sobbing night of terror.\\n\\n I\u0027m not saying we necessarily went around the whole time at that age worrying about the woods. I for one could go weeks hardly thinking about them, and there were even days when a defiant surge of courage would make me think: \"How could we believe rubbish like that?\" But then all it took would be one little thing--someone retelling one of those stories, a scary passage in a book, even just a chance remark reminding you of the woods--and that would mean another period of being under that shadow. It was hardly surprising then that we assumed the woods would be central in the plot to abduct Miss Geraldine.\\n\\n When it came down to it, though, I don\u0027t recall our taking many practical steps towards defending Miss Geraldine; our activities always revolved around gathering more and more evidence concerning the plot itself. For some reason, we were satisfied this would keep any immediate danger at bay.\\n\\n Most of our \"evidence\" came from witnessing the conspirators at work. One morning, for instance, we watched from a second-floor classroom Miss Eileen and Mr. Roger talking to Miss Geraldine down in the courtyard. After a while Miss Geraldine said goodbye and went off towards the Orangery, but we kept on watching, and saw Miss Eileen and Mr. Roger put their heads closer together to confer furtively, their gazes fixed on Miss Geraldine\u0027s receding figure.\\n\\n \"Mr. Roger,\" Ruth sighed on that occasion, shaking her head. \"Who\u0027d have guessed he was in it too?\"\\n\\n In this way we built up a list of people we knew to be in on the plot--guardians and students whom we declared our sworn enemies. And yet, all the time, I think we must have had an idea of how precarious the foundations of our fantasy were, because we always avoided any confrontation. We could decide, after intense discussions, that a particular student was a plotter, but then we\u0027d always find a reason not to challenge him just yet--to wait until \"we had in all the evidence.\" Similarly, we always agreed Miss Geraldine herself shouldn\u0027t hear a word of what we\u0027d found out, since she\u0027d get alarmed to no good purpose.\\n\\n It would be too easy to claim it was just Ruth who kept the secret guard going long after we\u0027d naturally outgrown it. Sure enough, the guard was important to her. She\u0027d known about the plot for much longer than the rest of us, and this gave her enormous authority; by hinting that the real evidence came from a time before people like me had joined--that there were things she\u0027d yet to reveal even to us--she could justify almost any decision she made on behalf of the group. If she decided someone should be expelled, for example, and she sensed opposition, she\u0027d just allude darkly to stuff she knew \"from before.\" There\u0027s no question Ruth was keen to keep the whole thing going. But the truth was, those of us who\u0027d grown close to her, we each played our part in preserving the fantasy and making it last for as long as possible. What happened after that row over the chess illustrates pretty well the point I\u0027m making.\\n\\n I\u0027D ASSUMED RUTH WAS SOMETHING of a chess expert and that she\u0027d be able to teach me the game. This wasn\u0027t so crazy: we\u0027d pass older students bent over chess sets, in window seats or on the grassy slopes, and Ruth would often pause to study a game. And as we walked off again, she\u0027d tell me about some move she\u0027d spotted that neither player had seen. \"Amazingly dim,\" she\u0027d murmur, shaking her head. This had all helped get me fascinated, and I was soon longing to become engrossed myself in those ornate pieces. So when I\u0027d found a chess set at a Sale and decided to buy it--despite it costing an awful lot of tokens--I was counting on Ruth\u0027s help.\\n\\n For the next several days, though, she sighed whenever I brought the subject up, or pretended she had something else really urgent to do. When I finally cornered her one rainy afternoon, and we set out the board in the billiards room, she proceeded to show me a game that was a vague variant on draughts. The distinguishing feature of chess, according to her, was that each piece moved in an L-shape--I suppose she\u0027d got this from watching the knight--rather than in the leap-frogging way of draughts. I didn\u0027t believe this, and I was really disappointed, but I made sure to say nothing and went along with her for a while. We spent several minutes knocking each other\u0027s pieces off the board, always sliding the attacking piece in an \"L.\" This continued until the time I tried to take her and she claimed it wouldn\u0027t count because I\u0027d slid my piece up to hers in too straight a line.\\n\\n At this, I stood up, packed up the set and walked off. I never said out loud that she didn\u0027t know how to play--disappointed as I was, I knew not to go that far--but my storming off was, I suppose, statement enough for her.\\n\\n It was maybe a day later, I came into Room 20 at the top of the house, where Mr. George had his poetry class. I don\u0027t remember if it was before or after the class, or how full the room was. I remember having books in my hands, and that as I moved towards where Ruth and the others were talking, there was a strong patch of sun across the desk-lids they were sitting on.\\n\\n I could see from the way they had their heads together they were discussing secret guard stuff, and although, as I say, the row with Ruth had been only the day before, for some reason I went up to them without a second thought. It was only when I was virtually right up to them--maybe there was a look exchanged between them--that it suddenly hit me what was about to happen. It was like the split second before you step into a puddle, you realise it\u0027s there, but there\u0027s nothing you can do about it. I felt the hurt even before they went silent and stared at me, even before Ruth said: \"Oh, Kathy, how are you? If you don\u0027t mind, we\u0027ve got something to discuss just now. We\u0027ll be finished in just a minute. Sorry.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d hardly finished her sentence before I\u0027d turned and was on my way out, angry more at myself for having walked into it than at Ruth and the others. I was upset, no doubt about it, though I don\u0027t know if I actually cried. And for the next few days, whenever I saw the secret guard conferring in a corner or as they walked across a field, I\u0027d feel a flush rising to my cheeks.\\n\\n Then about two days after this snub in Room 20, I was coming down the stairs of the main house when I found Moira B. just behind me. We started talking--about nothing special--and wandered out of the house together. It must have been the lunch break because as we stepped into the courtyard there were about twenty students loitering around chatting in little groups. My eyes went immediately to the far side of the courtyard, where Ruth and three of the secret guard were standing together, their backs to us, gazing intently towards the South Playing Field. I was trying to see what it was they were so interested in, when I became aware of Moira beside me also watching them. And then it occurred to me that only a month before she too had been a member of the secret guard, and had been expelled. For the next few seconds I felt something like acute embarrassment that the two of us should now be standing side by side, linked by our recent humiliations, actually staring our rejection in the face, as it were. Maybe Moira was experiencing something similar; anyway, she was the one who broke the silence, saying: \"It\u0027s so stupid, this whole secret guard thing. How can they still believe in something like that? It\u0027s like they\u0027re still in the Infants.\"\\n\\n Even today, I\u0027m puzzled by the sheer force of the emotion that overtook me when I heard Moira say this. I turned to her, completely furious: \"What do you know about it? You just don\u0027t know anything, because you\u0027ve been out of it for ages now! If you knew everything we\u0027d found out, you wouldn\u0027t dare say anything so daft!\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t talk rubbish.\" Moira was never one to back down easily. \"It\u0027s just another of Ruth\u0027s made-up things, that\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"Then how come I\u0027ve personally heard them talking about it? Talking about how they\u0027re going to take Miss Geraldine to the woods in the milk van? How come I heard them planning it myself, nothing to do with Ruth or anyone else?\"\\n\\n Moira looked at me, unsure now. \"You heard it yourself? How? Where?\"\\n\\n \"I heard them talking, clear as anything, heard every word, they didn\u0027t know I was there. Down by the pond, they didn\u0027t know I could hear. So that just shows how much you know!\"\\n\\n I pushed past her and as I made my way across the crowded courtyard, I glanced back to the figures of Ruth and the others, still gazing out towards the South Playing Field, unaware of what had just happened between me and Moira. And I noticed I didn\u0027t feel angry at all with them any more; just hugely irritated with Moira.\\n\\n Even now, if I\u0027m driving on a long grey road and my thoughts have nowhere special to go, I might find myself turning all of this over. Why was I so hostile to Moira B. that day when she was, really, a natural ally? What it was, I suppose, is that Moira was suggesting she and I cross some line together, and I wasn\u0027t prepared for that yet. I think I sensed how beyond that line, there was something harder and darker and I didn\u0027t want that. Not for me, not for any of us.\\n\\n But at other times, I think that\u0027s wrong--that it was just to do with me and Ruth, and the sort of loyalty she inspired in me in those days. And maybe that\u0027s why, even though I really wanted to on several occasions, I never brought it up--about what had happened that day with Moira--the whole time I was caring for Ruth down at the centre in Dover.\\n\\n \\n\\n ALL OF THIS ABOUT MISS GERALDINE reminds me of something that happened about three years later, long after the secret guard idea had faded away.\\n\\n We were in Room 5 on the ground floor at the back of the house, waiting for a class to start. Room 5 was the smallest room, and especially on a winter morning like that one, when the big radiators came on and steamed up the windows, it would get really stuffy. Maybe I\u0027m exaggerating it, but my memory is that for a whole class to fit into that room, students literally had to pile on top of each other.\\n\\n That morning Ruth had got a chair behind a desk, and I was sitting up on its lid, with two or three others of our group perched or leaning in nearby. In fact, I think it was when I was squeezing up to let someone else in beside me that I first noticed the pencil case.\\n\\n I can see the thing now like it\u0027s here in front of me. It was shiny, like a polished shoe; a deep tan colour with circled red dots drifting all over it. The zip across the top edge had a furry pompom to pull it. I\u0027d almost sat on the pencil case when I\u0027d shifted and Ruth quickly moved it out of my way. But I\u0027d seen it, as she\u0027d intended me to, and I said: \"Oh! Where did you get that? Was it in the Sale?\"\\n\\n It was noisy in the room, but the girls nearby had heard, so there were soon four or five of us staring admiringly at the pencil case. Ruth said nothing for a few seconds while she checked carefully the faces around her. Finally she said very deliberately: \"Let\u0027s just agree. Let\u0027s agree I got it in the Sale.\" Then she gave us all a knowing smile.\\n\\n This might sound a pretty innocuous sort of response, but actually it was like she\u0027d suddenly got up and hit me, and for the next few moments I felt hot and chilly at the same time. I knew exactly what she\u0027d meant by her answer and smile: she was claiming the pencil case was a gift from Miss Geraldine.\\n\\n There could be no mistake about this because it had been building up for weeks. There was a certain smile, a certain voice Ruth would use--sometimes accompanied by a finger to the lips or a hand raised stage-whisper style--whenever she wanted to hint about some little mark of favour Miss Geraldine had shown her: Miss Geraldine had allowed Ruth to play a music tape in the billiards room before four o\u0027clock on a weekday; Miss Geraldine had ordered silence on a fields walk, but when Ruth had drawn up beside her, she\u0027d started to talk to her, then let the rest of the group talk. It was always stuff like that, and never explicitly claimed, just implied by her smile and \"let\u0027s say no more\" expression.\\n\\n Of course, officially, guardians weren\u0027t supposed to show favouritism, but there were little displays of affection all the time within certain parameters; and most of what Ruth suggested fell easily within them. Still, I hated it when Ruth hinted in this way. I was never sure, of course, if she was telling the truth, but since she wasn\u0027t actually \"telling\" it, only hinting, it was never possible to challenge her. So each time it happened, I\u0027d have to let it go, biting my lip and hoping the moment would pass quickly.\\n\\n Sometimes I\u0027d see from the way a conversation was moving that one of these moments was coming, and I\u0027d brace myself. Even then, it would always hit me with some force, so that for several minutes I wouldn\u0027t be able to concentrate on anything going on around me. But on that winter morning in Room 5, it had come at me straight out of the blue. Even after I\u0027d seen the pencil case, the idea of a guardian giving a present like that was so beyond the bounds, I hadn\u0027t seen it coming at all. So once Ruth had said what she\u0027d said, I wasn\u0027t able, in my usual way, to let the emotional flurry just pass. I just stared at her, making no attempt to disguise my anger. Ruth, perhaps seeing danger, said to me quickly in a stage whisper: \"Not a word!\" and smiled again. But I couldn\u0027t return the smile and went on glaring at her. Then luckily the guardian arrived and the class started.\\n\\n I was never the sort of kid who brooded over things for hours on end. I\u0027ve got that way a bit these days, but that\u0027s the work I do and the long hours of quiet when I\u0027m driving across these empty fields. I wasn\u0027t like, say, Laura, who for all her clowning around could worry for days, weeks even, about some little thing someone said to her. But after that morning in Room 5, I did go around in a bit of a trance. I\u0027d drift off in the middle of conversations; whole lessons went by with me not knowing what was going on. I was determined Ruth shouldn\u0027t get away with it this time, but for a long while I wasn\u0027t doing anything constructive about it; just playing fantastic scenes in my head where I\u0027d expose her and force her to admit she\u0027d made it up. I even had one hazy fantasy where Miss Geraldine herself heard about it and gave Ruth a complete dressing-down in front of everyone.\\n\\n After days of this I started to think more solidly. If the pencil case hadn\u0027t come from Miss Geraldine, where had it come from? She might have got it from another student, but that was unlikely. If it had belonged to anyone else first, even someone years above us, a gorgeous item like that wouldn\u0027t have gone unnoticed. Ruth would never risk a story like hers knowing the pencil case had already knocked around Hailsham. Almost certainly she\u0027d found it at a Sale. Here, too, Ruth ran the risk of others having seen it before she\u0027d bought it. But if--as sometimes happened, though it wasn\u0027t really allowed--she\u0027d heard about the pencil case coming in and reserved it with one of the monitors before the Sale opened, she could then be reasonably confident hardly anyone had seen it.\\n\\n Unfortunately for Ruth, though, there were registers kept of everything bought at the Sales, along with a record of who\u0027d done the buying. While these registers weren\u0027t easily obtainable--the monitors took them back to Miss Emily\u0027s office after each Sale--they weren\u0027t top secret either. If I hung around a monitor at the next Sale, it wouldn\u0027t be difficult to browse through the pages.\\n\\n So I had the outlines of a plan, and I think I went on refining it for several days before it occurred to me it wasn\u0027t actually necessary to carry out all the steps. Provided I was right about the pencil case coming from a Sale, all I had to do was bluff.\\n\\n That was how Ruth and I came to have our conversation under the eaves. There was fog and drizzle that day. The two of us were walking from the dorm huts perhaps towards the pavilion, I\u0027m not sure. Anyway, as we were crossing the courtyard, the rain suddenly got heavier and since we were in no hurry, we tucked ourselves in under the eaves of the main house, a little to one side of the front entrance.\\n\\n We sheltered there for a while, and every so often a student would come running out of the fog and in through the doors of the house, but the rain didn\u0027t ease. And the longer we continued to stand there, the more tense I grew because I could see this was the opportunity I\u0027d been waiting for. Ruth too, I\u0027m sure, sensed something was coming up. In the end, I decided to come straight out with it.\\n\\n \"At the Sale last Tuesday,\" I said. \"I was just looking through the book. You know, the register thing.\"\\n\\n \"Why were you looking at the register?\" Ruth asked quickly. \"Why were you doing something like that?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no reason. Christopher C. was one of the monitors, so I was just talking to him. He\u0027s the best Senior boy, definitely. And I was just turning over the pages of the register, just for something to do.\"\\n\\n Ruth\u0027s mind, I could tell, had raced on, and she now knew exactly what this was about. But she said calmly: \"Boring sort of thing to look at.\"\\n\\n \"No, it was quite interesting really. You can see all the things people have bought.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d said this staring out at the rain. Then I glanced at Ruth and got a real shock. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d expected; for all my fantasies of the past month, I\u0027d never really considered what it would be like in a real situation like the one unfolding at that moment. Now I saw how upset Ruth was; how for once she was at a complete loss for words, and had turned away on the verge of tears. And suddenly my behaviour seemed to me utterly baffling. All this effort, all this planning, just to upset my dearest friend. So what if she\u0027d fibbed a little about her pencil case? Didn\u0027t we all dream from time to time about one guardian or other bending the rules and doing something special for us? A spontaneous hug, a secret letter, a gift? All Ruth had done was to take one of these harmless daydreams a step further; she hadn\u0027t even mentioned Miss Geraldine by name.\\n\\n I now felt awful, and I was confused. But as we stood there together staring at the fog and rain, I could think of no way now to repair the damage I\u0027d done. I think I said something pathetic like: \"It\u0027s all right, I didn\u0027t see anything much,\" which hung stupidly in the air. Then after a few further seconds of silence, Ruth walked off into the rain.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372/907.html","bookId":311,"book":{"id":311,"title":"别让我走 Never let me go","description":"简介： 一段令人心碎、惴惴不安的爱情故事，勾勒出一幅阐明人性的脆弱与希望、寻找乡关何处的宿命风景，而在平凡寻常文字间，呈现惊人真相的悬疑推理画面 海尔森表面上看来是一所迷人...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110906/1-110Z6102914c2.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
