{"id":23204,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"For the most part being a carer\u0027s suited me fine. You could even say it\u0027s brought the best out of me. But some people just aren\u0027t cut out for it, and for them the whole thing becomes a real struggle. They might start off positively enough, but then comes all that time spent so close to the pain and the worry. And sooner or later a donor doesn\u0027t make it, even though, say, it\u0027s only the second donation and no one anticipated complications. When a donor completes like that, out of the blue, it doesn\u0027t make much difference what the nurses say to you afterwards, and neither does that letter saying how they\u0027re sure you did all you could and to keep up the good work. For a while at least, you\u0027re demoralised. Some of us learn pretty quick how to deal with it. But others--like Laura, say--they never do. Then there\u0027s the solitude. You grow up surrounded by crowds of people, that\u0027s all you\u0027ve ever known, and suddenly you\u0027re a carer. You spend hour after hour, on your own, driving across the country, centre to centre, hospital to hospital, sleeping in overnights, no one to talk to about your worries, no one to have a laugh with. Just now and again you run into a student you know--a carer or donor you recognise from the old days--but there\u0027s never much time. You\u0027re always in a rush, or else you\u0027re too exhausted to have a proper conversation. Soon enough, the long hours, the travelling, the broken sleep have all crept into your being and become part of you, so everyone can see it, in your posture, your gaze, the way you move and talk. I don\u0027t claim I\u0027ve been immune to all of this, but I\u0027ve learnt to live with it. Some carers, though, their whole attitude lets them down. A lot of them, you can tell, are just going through the motions, waiting for the day they\u0027re told they can stop and become donors. It really gets me, too, the way so many of them \"shrink\" the moment they step inside a hospital. They don\u0027t know what to say to the whitecoats, they can\u0027t make themselves speak up on behalf of their donor. No wonder they end up feeling frustrated and blaming themselves when things go wrong. I try not to make a nuisance of myself, but I\u0027ve figured out how to get my voice heard when I have to. And when things go badly, of course I\u0027m upset, but at least I can feel I\u0027ve done all I could and keep things in perspective. Even the solitude, I\u0027ve actually grown to quite like. That\u0027s not to say I\u0027m not looking forward to a bit more companionship come the end of the year when I\u0027m finished with all of this. But I do like the feeling of getting into my little car, knowing for the next couple of hours I\u0027ll have only the roads, the big grey sky and my daydreams for company. And if I\u0027m in a town somewhere with several minutes to kill, I\u0027ll enjoy myself wandering about looking in the shop windows. Here in my bedsit, I\u0027ve got these four desk-lamps, each a different colour, but all the same design--they have these ribbed necks you can bend whichever way you want. So I might go looking for a shop with another lamp like that in its window--not to buy, but just to compare with my ones at home. Sometimes I get so immersed in my own company, if I unexpectedly run into someone I know, it\u0027s a bit of a shock and takes me a while to adjust. That\u0027s the way it was the morning I was walking across the windswept car park of the service station and spotted Laura, sitting behind the wheel of one of the parked cars, looking vacantly towards the motorway. I was still some way away, and just for a second, even though we hadn\u0027t met since the Cottages seven years before, I was tempted to ignore her and keep walking. An odd reaction, I know, considering she\u0027d been one of my closest friends. As I say, it may have been partly because I didn\u0027t like being bumped out of my daydreams. But also, I suppose, when I saw Laura slumped in her car like that, I saw immediately she\u0027d become one of these carers I\u0027ve just been describing, and a part of me just didn\u0027t want to find out much more about it. But of course I did go to her. There was a chilly wind blowing against me as I walked over to her hatchback, parked away from the other vehicles. Laura was wearing a shapeless blue anorak, and her hair--a lot shorter than before--was sticking to her forehead. When I tapped on her window, she didn\u0027t start, or even look surprised to see me after all that time. It was almost like she\u0027d been sitting there waiting, if not for me precisely, then for someone more or less like me from the old days. And now I\u0027d shown up, her first thought seemed to be: \"At last!\" Because I could see her shoulders move in a kind of sigh, then without further ado, she reached over to open the door for me. We talked for about twenty minutes: I didn\u0027t leave until the last possible moment. A lot of it was about her, how exhausted she\u0027d been, how difficult one of her donors was, how much she loathed this nurse or that doctor. I waited to see a flash of the old Laura, with the mischievous grin and inevitable wisecrack, but none of that came. She talked faster than she used to, and although she seemed pleased to see me, I sometimes got the impression it wouldn\u0027t have mattered much if it wasn\u0027t me, but someone else, so long as she got to talk. Maybe we both felt there was something dangerous about bringing up the old days, because for ages we avoided any mention of them. In the end, though, we found ourselves talking about Ruth, who Laura had run into at a clinic a few years earlier, when Ruth was still a carer. I began quizzing her about how Ruth had been, but she was so unforthcoming, in the end I said to her: \"Look, you must have talked about something.\" Laura let out a long sigh. \"You know how it gets,\" she said. \"We were both in a hurry.\" Then she added: \"Anyway, we hadn\u0027t parted the best of friends, back at the Cottages. So maybe we weren\u0027t so delighted to see one another.\" \"I didn\u0027t realise you\u0027d fallen out with her too,\" I said. She shrugged. \"It wasn\u0027t any big deal. You remember the way she was back then. If anything, after you left, she got worse. You know, always telling everyone what to do. So I was keeping out of her way, that was all. We never had a big fight or anything. So you haven\u0027t seen her since then?\" \"No. Funny, but I\u0027ve never even glimpsed her.\" \"Yeah, it\u0027s funny. You\u0027d think we\u0027d all run into each other much more. I\u0027ve seen Hannah a few times. And Michael H. too.\" Then she said: \"I heard this rumour, that Ruth had a really bad first donation. Just a rumour, but I heard it more than once.\" \"I heard that too,\" I said. \"Poor Ruth.\" We were quiet for a moment. Then Laura asked: \"Is it right, Kathy? That they let you choose your donors now?\" She\u0027d not asked in the accusing way people do sometimes, so I nodded and said: \"Not every time. But I did well with a few donors, so yeah, I get to have a say every now and then.\" \"If you can choose,\" Laura said, \"why don\u0027t you become Ruth\u0027s carer?\" I shrugged. \"I\u0027ve thought about it. But I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s such a great idea.\" Laura looked puzzled. \"But you and Ruth, you were so close.\" \"Yeah, I suppose so. But like with you, Laura. She and I weren\u0027t such great friends by the end.\" \"Oh, but that was back then. She\u0027s had a bad time. And I\u0027ve heard she\u0027s had trouble with her carers too. They\u0027ve had to change them around a lot for her.\" \"Not surprising really,\" I said. \"Can you imagine? Being Ruth\u0027s carer?\" Laura laughed, and for a second a look came into her eyes that made me think she was finally going to come out with a crack. But then the light died, and she just went on sitting there looking tired. We talked a little more about Laura\u0027s problems--in particular about a certain nursing sister who seemed to have it in for her. Then it was time for me to go, and I reached for the door and was telling her we\u0027d have to talk more the next time we met. But we were both of us by then acutely aware of something we\u0027d not yet mentioned, and I think we both sensed there\u0027d be something wrong about us parting like that. In fact, I\u0027m pretty sure now, at that moment, our minds were running along exactly the same lines. Then she said: \"It\u0027s weird. Thinking it\u0027s all gone now.\" I turned in my seat to face her again. \"Yeah, it\u0027s really strange,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t really believe it\u0027s not there any more.\" \"It\u0027s so weird,\" Laura said. \"I suppose it shouldn\u0027t make any difference to me now. But somehow it does.\" \"I know what you mean.\" It was that exchange, when we finally mentioned the closing of Hailsham, that suddenly brought us close again, and we hugged, quite spontaneously, not so much to comfort one another, but as a way of affirming Hailsham, the fact that it was still there in both our memories. Then I had to hurry off to my own car. I\u0027d first started hearing rumours about Hailsham closing a year or so before that meeting with Laura in the car park. I\u0027d be talking to a donor or a carer and they\u0027d bring it up in passing, like they expected me to know all about it. \"You were at Hailsham, weren\u0027t you? So is it really true?\" That sort of thing. Then one day I was coming out of a clinic in Suffolk and ran into Roger C., who\u0027d been in the year below, and he told me with complete certainty it was about to happen. Hailsham was going to close any day and there were plans to sell the house and grounds to a hotel chain. I remember my first response when he told me this. I said: \"But what\u0027ll happen to all the students?\" Roger obviously thought I\u0027d meant the ones still there, the little ones dependent on their guardians, and he put on a troubled face and began speculating how they\u0027d have to be transferred to other houses around the country, even though some of these would be a far cry from Hailsham. But of course, that wasn\u0027t what I\u0027d meant. I\u0027d meant us, all the students who\u0027d grown up with me and were now spread across the country, carers and donors, all separated now but still somehow linked by the place we\u0027d come from. That same night, trying to get to sleep in an overnight, I kept thinking about something that had happened to me a few days earlier. I\u0027d been in a seaside town in North Wales. It had been raining hard all morning, but after lunch, it had stopped and the sun had come out a bit. I was walking back to where I\u0027d left my car, along one of those long straight seafront roads. There was hardly anyone else about, so I could see an unbroken line of wet paving stones stretching on in front of me. Then after a while a van pulled up, maybe thirty yards ahead of me, and a man got out dressed as a clown. He opened the back of the van and took out a bunch of helium balloons, about a dozen of them, and for a moment, he was holding the balloons in one hand, while he bent down and rummaged about in his vehicle with the other. As I came closer, I could see the balloons had faces and shaped ears, and they looked like a little tribe, bobbing in the air above their owner, waiting for him. Then the clown straightened, closed up his van and started walking, in the same direction I was walking, several paces ahead of me, a small suitcase in one hand, the balloons in the other. The seafront continued long and straight, and I was walking behind him for what seemed like ages. Sometimes I felt awkward about it, and I even thought the clown might turn and say something. But since that was the way I had to go, there wasn\u0027t much else I could do. So we just kept walking, the clown and me, on and on along the deserted pavement still wet from the morning, and all the time the balloons were bumping and grinning down at me. Every so often, I could see the man\u0027s fist, where all the balloon strings converged, and I could see he had them securely twisted together and in a tight grip. Even so, I kept worrying that one of the strings would come unravelled and a single balloon would sail off up into that cloudy sky. Lying awake that night after what Roger had told me, I kept seeing those balloons again. I thought about Hailsham closing, and how it was like someone coming along with a pair of shears and snipping the balloon strings just where they entwined above the man\u0027s fist. Once that happened, there\u0027d be no real sense in which those balloons belonged with each other any more. When he was telling me the news about Hailsham, Roger had made a remark, saying he supposed it wouldn\u0027t make so much difference to the likes of us any more. And in certain ways, he might have been right. But it was unnerving, to think things weren\u0027t still going on back there, just as always; that people like Miss Geraldine, say, weren\u0027t leading groups of Juniors around the North Playing Field. In the months after that talk with Roger, I kept thinking about it a lot, about Hailsham closing and all the implications. And it started to dawn on me, I suppose, that a lot of things I\u0027d always assumed I\u0027d plenty of time to get round to doing, I might now have to act on pretty soon or else let them go forever. It\u0027s not that I started to panic, exactly. But it definitely felt like Hailsham\u0027s going away had shifted everything around us. That\u0027s why what Laura said to me that day, about my becoming Ruth\u0027s carer, had such an impact on me, even though I\u0027d stone-walled her at the time. It was almost like a part of me had already made that decision, and Laura\u0027s words had simply pulled away a veil that had been covering it over. I FIRST TURNED UP AT RUTH\u0027S recovery centre in Dover--the modern one with the white tiled walls--just a few weeks after that talk with Laura. It had been around two months since Ruth\u0027s first donation--which, as Laura had said, hadn\u0027t gone at all well. When I came into her room, she was sitting on the edge of her bed in her night-dress and gave me a big smile. She got up to give me a hug, but almost immediately sat down again. She told me I was looking better than ever, and that my hair suited me really well. I said nice things about her too, and for the next half hour or so, I think we were genuinely delighted to be with each other. We talked about all kinds of things--Hailsham, the Cottages, what we\u0027d been doing since then--and it felt like we could talk and talk forever. In other words, it was a really encouraging start--better than I\u0027d dared expect. Even so, that first time, we didn\u0027t say anything about the way we\u0027d parted. Maybe if we\u0027d tackled it at the start, things would have played out differently, who knows? As it was, we just skipped over it, and once we\u0027d been talking for a while, it was as if we\u0027d agreed to pretend none of that had ever happened. That may have been fine as far as that first meeting was concerned. But once I officially became her carer, and I began to see her regularly, the sense of something not being right grew stronger and stronger. I developed a routine of coming in three or four times a week in the late afternoon, with mineral water and a packet of her favourite biscuits, and it should have been wonderful, but at the beginning it was anything but that. We\u0027d start talking about something, something completely innocent, and for no obvious reason we\u0027d come to a halt. Or if we did manage to keep up a conversation, the longer we went on, the more stilted and guarded it became. Then one afternoon, I was coming down her corridor to see her and heard someone in the shower room opposite her door. I guessed it was Ruth in there, so I let myself into her room, and was standing waiting for her, looking at the view from her window over all the rooftops. About five minutes passed, then she came in wrapped in a towel. Now to be fair, she wasn\u0027t expecting me for another hour, and I suppose we all feel a bit vulnerable after a shower with just a towel on. Even so, the look of alarm that went across her face took me aback. I have to explain this a bit. Of course, I was expecting her to be a little surprised. But the thing was, after she\u0027d taken it in and seen it was me, there was a clear second, maybe more, when she went on looking at me if not with fear, then with a real wariness. It was like she\u0027d been waiting and waiting for me to do something to her, and she thought the time had now come. The look was gone the next instant and we just carried on as usual, but that incident gave us both a jolt. It made me realise Ruth didn\u0027t trust me, and for all I know, maybe she herself hadn\u0027t fully realised it until that moment. In any case, after that day, the atmosphere got even worse. It was like we\u0027d let something out into the open, and far from clearing the air, it had made us more aware than ever of everything that had come between us. It got to the stage where before I went in to see her, I\u0027d sit in my car for several minutes working myself up for the ordeal. After one particular session, when we did all the checks on her in stony silence, then afterwards just sat there in more silence, I was about ready to report to them that it hadn\u0027t worked out, that I should stop being Ruth\u0027s carer. But then everything changed again, and that was because of the boat. GOD KNOWS HOW THESE THINGS WORK. Sometimes it\u0027s a particular joke, sometimes a rumour. It travels from centre to centre, right the way across the country in a matter of days, and suddenly every donor\u0027s talking about it. Well, this time it was to do with this boat. I\u0027d first heard about it from a couple of my donors up in North Wales. Then a few days later, Ruth too started telling me about it. I was just relieved we\u0027d found something to talk about, and encouraged her to go on. \"This boy on the next floor,\" she said. \"His carer\u0027s actually been to see it. He says it\u0027s not far from the road, so anyone can get to it without much bother. This boat, it\u0027s just sitting there, stranded in the marshes.\" \"How did it get there?\" I asked. \"How do I know? Maybe they wanted to dump it, whoever owned it. Or maybe sometime, when everything was flooded, it just drifted in and got itself beached. Who knows? It\u0027s supposed to be this old fishing boat. With a little cabin for a couple of fishermen to squeeze into when it\u0027s stormy.\" The next few times I came to see her, she always managed to bring up the boat again. Then one afternoon, when she began telling me how one of the other donors at the centre had been taken by her carer to see it, I said to her: \"Look, it\u0027s not particularly near, you know. It would take an hour, maybe an hour and a half to drive.\" \"I wasn\u0027t suggesting anything. I know you\u0027ve got other donors to worry about.\" \"But you\u0027d like to see it. You\u0027d like to see this boat, wouldn\u0027t you, Ruth?\" \"I suppose so. I suppose I would. You spend day after day in this place. Yeah, it\u0027d be good to see something like that.\" \"And do you suppose\"--I said this gently, without a hint of sarcasm--\"if we\u0027re driving all that way, we should think about calling in on Tommy? Seeing his centre\u0027s just down the road from where this boat\u0027s meant to be?\" Ruth\u0027s face didn\u0027t show anything at first. \"I suppose we could think about it,\" she said. Then she laughed and added: \"Honest, Kathy, that wasn\u0027t the only reason I\u0027ve been going on about the boat. I do want to see it, for its own sake. All this time in and out of hospital. Then cooped up here. Things like that matter more than they once did. But all right, I did know. I knew Tommy was at the Kingsfield centre.\" \"Are you sure you want to see him?\" \"Yes,\" she said, no hesitation, looking straight at me. \"Yes, I do.\" Then she said quietly: \"I haven\u0027t seen that boy for a long time. Not since the Cottages.\" Then, at last, we talked about Tommy. We didn\u0027t go into things in a big way and I didn\u0027t learn much I didn\u0027t know already. But I think we both felt better we\u0027d finally brought him up. Ruth told me how, by the time she left the Cottages the autumn after me, she and Tommy had more or less drifted apart. \"Since we were going different places to do our training anyway,\" she said, \"it didn\u0027t seem worth it, to split up properly. So we just stayed together until I left.\" And at that stage, we didn\u0027t say much more about it than that. As for the trip out to see the boat, I neither agreed nor disagreed to it, that first time we discussed it. But over the next couple of weeks, Ruth kept bringing it up, and our plans somehow grew firmer, until in the end, I sent a message to Tommy\u0027s carer through a contact, saying that unless we heard from Tommy telling us not to, we\u0027d show up at the Kingsfield on a particular afternoon the following week.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372/920.html","bookId":311,"book":{"id":311,"title":"别让我走 Never let me go","description":"简介： 一段令人心碎、惴惴不安的爱情故事，勾勒出一幅阐明人性的脆弱与希望、寻找乡关何处的宿命风景，而在平凡寻常文字间，呈现惊人真相的悬疑推理画面 海尔森表面上看来是一所迷人...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110906/1-110Z6102914c2.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
