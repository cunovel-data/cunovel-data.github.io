{"id":23188,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"This was all a long time ago so I might have some of it wrong; but my memory of it is that my approaching Tommy that afternoon was part of a phase I was going through around that time--something to do with compulsively setting myself challenges--and I\u0027d more or less forgotten all about it when Tommy stopped me a few days later. I don\u0027t know how it was where you were, but at Hailsham we had to have some form of medical almost every week--usually up in Room 18 at the very top of the house--with stern Nurse Trisha, or Crow Face, as we called her. That sunny morning a crowd of us was going up the central staircase to be examined by her, while another lot she\u0027d just finished with was on its way down. So the stairwell was filled with echoing noise, and I was climbing the steps head down, just following the heels of the person in front, when a voice near me went: \"Kath!\" Tommy, who was in the stream coming down, had stopped dead on the stairs with a big open smile that immediately irritated me. A few years earlier maybe, if we ran into someone we were pleased to see, we\u0027d put on that sort of look. But we were thirteen by then, and this was a boy running into a girl in a really public situation. I felt like saying: \"Tommy, why don\u0027t you grow up?\" But I stopped myself, and said instead: \"Tommy, you\u0027re holding everyone up. And so am I.\" He glanced upwards and sure enough the flight above was already grinding to a halt. For a second he looked panicked, then he squeezed himself right into the wall next to me, so it was just about possible for people to push past. Then he said: \"Kath, I\u0027ve been looking all over for you. I meant to say sorry. I mean, I\u0027m really, really sorry. I honestly didn\u0027t mean to hit you the other day. I wouldn\u0027t dream of hitting a girl, and even if I did, I\u0027d never want to hit you. I\u0027m really, really sorry.\" \"It\u0027s okay. An accident, that\u0027s all.\" I gave him a nod and made to move away. But Tommy said brightly: \"The shirt\u0027s all right now. It all washed out.\" \"That\u0027s good.\" \"It didn\u0027t hurt, did it? When I hit you?\" \"Sure. Fractured skull. Concussion, the lot. Even Crow Face might notice it. That\u0027s if I ever get up there.\" \"But seriously, Kath. No hard feelings, right? I\u0027m awfully sorry. I am, honestly.\" At last I gave him a smile and said with no irony: \"Look, Tommy, it was an accident and it\u0027s now one hundred percent forgotten. I don\u0027t hold it against you one tiny bit.\" He still looked unsure, but now some older students were pushing behind him, telling him to move. He gave me a quick smile and patted my shoulder, like he might do to a younger boy, and pushed his way into the flow. Then, as I began to climb, I heard him shout from below: \"See you, Kath!\" I\u0027d found the whole thing mildly embarrassing, but it didn\u0027t lead to any teasing or gossip; and I must admit, if it hadn\u0027t been for that encounter on the stairs, I probably wouldn\u0027t have taken the interest I did in Tommy\u0027s problems over the next several weeks. I saw a few of the incidents myself. But mostly I heard about them, and when I did, I quizzed people until I\u0027d got a more or less full account. There were more temper tantrums, like the time Tommy was supposed to have heaved over two desks in Room 14, spilling all the contents on the floor, while the rest of the class, having escaped onto the landing, barricaded the door to stop him coming out. There was the time Mr. Christopher had had to pin back his arms to stop him attacking Reggie D. during football practice. Everyone could see, too, when the Senior 2 boys went on their fields run, Tommy was the only one without a running partner. He was a good runner, and would quickly open up ten, fifteen yards between him and the rest, maybe thinking this would disguise the fact that no one wanted to run with him. Then there were rumours almost every day of pranks that had been played on him. A lot of these were the usual stuff--weird things in his bed, a worm in his cereal--but some of it sounded pointlessly nasty: like the time someone cleaned a toilet with his toothbrush so it was waiting for him with shit all over the bristles. His size and strength--and I suppose that temper--meant no one tried actual physical bullying, but from what I remember, for a couple of months at least, these incidents kept coming. I thought sooner or later someone would start saying it had gone too far, but it just kept on, and no one said anything. I tried to bring it up once myself, in the dorm after lights-out. In the Seniors, we were down to six per dorm, so it was just our little group, and we often had our most intimate conversations lying in the dark before we fell asleep. You could talk about things there you wouldn\u0027t dream of talking about any other place, not even in the pavilion. So one night I brought up Tommy. I didn\u0027t say much; I just summed up what had been happening to him and said it wasn\u0027t really very fair. When I\u0027d finished, there was a funny sort of silence hanging in the dark, and I realised everyone was waiting for Ruth\u0027s response--which was usually what happened whenever something a bit awkward came up. I kept waiting, then I heard a sigh from Ruth\u0027s side of the room, and she said: \"You\u0027ve got a point, Kathy. It\u0027s not nice. But if he wants it to stop, he\u0027s got to change his own attitude. He didn\u0027t have a thing for the Spring Exchange. And has he got anything for next month? I bet he hasn\u0027t.\" I should explain a bit here about the Exchanges we had at Hailsham. Four times a year--spring, summer, autumn, winter--we had a kind of big exhibition-cum-sale of all the things we\u0027d been creating in the three months since the last Exchange. Paintings, drawings, pottery; all sorts of \"sculptures\" made from whatever was the craze of the day--bashed-up cans, maybe, or bottle tops stuck onto cardboard. For each thing you put in, you were paid in Exchange Tokens--the guardians decided how many your particular masterpiece merited--and then on the day of the Exchange you went along with your tokens and \"bought\" the stuff you liked. The rule was you could only buy work done by students in your own year, but that still gave us plenty to choose from, since most of us could get pretty prolific over a three-month period. Looking back now, I can see why the Exchanges became so important to us. For a start, they were our only means, aside from the Sales--the Sales were something else, which I\u0027ll come to later--of building up a collection of personal possessions. If, say, you wanted to decorate the walls around your bed, or wanted something to carry around in your bag and place on your desk from room to room, then you could find it at the Exchange. I can see now, too, how the Exchanges had a more subtle effect on us all. If you think about it, being dependent on each other to produce the stuff that might become your private treasures--that\u0027s bound to do things to your relationships. The Tommy business was typical. A lot of the time, how you were regarded at Hailsham, how much you were liked and respected, had to do with how good you were at \"creating.\" Ruth and I often found ourselves remembering these things a few years ago, when I was caring for her down at the recovery centre in Dover. \"It\u0027s all part of what made Hailsham so special,\" she said once. \"The way we were encouraged to value each other\u0027s work.\" \"True,\" I said. \"But sometimes, when I think about the Exchanges now, a lot of it seems a bit odd. The poetry, for instance. I remember we were allowed to hand in poems, instead of a drawing or a painting. And the strange thing was, we all thought that was fine, we thought that made sense.\" \"Why shouldn\u0027t it? Poetry\u0027s important.\" \"But we\u0027re talking about nine-year-old stuff, funny little lines, all misspelt, in exercise books. We\u0027d spend our precious tokens on an exercise book full of that stuff rather than on something really nice for around our beds. If we were so keen on a person\u0027s poetry, why didn\u0027t we just borrow it and copy it down ourselves any old afternoon? But you remember how it was. An Exchange would come along and we\u0027d be standing there torn between Susie K.\u0027s poems and those giraffes Jackie used to make.\" \"Jackie\u0027s giraffes,\" Ruth said with a laugh. \"They were so beautiful. I used to have one.\" We were having this conversation on a fine summer evening, sitting out on the little balcony of her recovery room. It was a few months after her first donation, and now she was over the worst of it, I\u0027d always time my evening visits so that we\u0027d be able to spend a half hour or so out there, watching the sun go down over the rooftops. You could see lots of aerials and satellite dishes, and sometimes, right over in the distance, a glistening line that was the sea. I\u0027d bring mineral water and biscuits, and we\u0027d sit there talking about anything that came into our heads. The centre Ruth was in that time, it\u0027s one of my favourites, and I wouldn\u0027t mind at all if that\u0027s where I ended up. The recovery rooms are small, but they\u0027re well-designed and comfortable. Everything--the walls, the floor--has been done in gleaming white tiles, which the centre keeps so clean when you first go in it\u0027s almost like entering a hall of mirrors. Of course, you don\u0027t exactly see yourself reflected back loads of times, but you almost think you do. When you lift an arm, or when someone sits up in bed, you can feel this pale, shadowy movement all around you in the tiles. Anyway, Ruth\u0027s room at that centre, it also had these big glass sliding panels, so she could easily see the outside from her bed. Even with her head on the pillow she\u0027d see a big lot of sky, and if it was warm enough, she could get all the fresh air she wanted by stepping out onto the balcony. I loved visiting her there, loved those meandering talks we had, through the summer to the early autumn, sitting on that balcony together, talking about Hailsham, the Cottages, whatever else drifted into our thoughts. \"What I\u0027m saying,\" I went on, \"is that when we were that age, when we were eleven, say, we really weren\u0027t interested in each other\u0027s poems at all. But remember, someone like Christy? Christy had this great reputation for poetry, and we all looked up to her for it. Even you, Ruth, you didn\u0027t dare boss Christy around. All because we thought she was great at poetry. But we didn\u0027t know a thing about poetry. We didn\u0027t care about it. It\u0027s strange.\" But Ruth didn\u0027t get my point--or maybe she was deliberately avoiding it. Maybe she was determined to remember us all as more sophisticated than we were. Or maybe she could sense where my talk was leading, and didn\u0027t want us to go that way. Anyway, she let out a long sigh and said: \"We all thought Christy\u0027s poems were so good. But I wonder how they\u0027d look to us now. I wish we had some here, I\u0027d love to see what we\u0027d think.\" Then she laughed and said: \"I have still got some poems by Peter B. But that was much later, when we were in Senior 4. I must have fancied him. I can\u0027t think why else I\u0027d have bought his poems. They\u0027re just hysterically daft. Takes himself so seriously. But Christy, she was good, I remember she was. It\u0027s funny, she went right off poems when she started her painting. And she was nowhere near as good at that.\" But let me get back to Tommy. What Ruth said that time in our dorm after lights-out, about how Tommy had brought all his problems on himself, probably summed up what most people at Hailsham thought at that time. But it was when she said what she did that it occurred to me, as I lay there, that this whole notion of his deliberately not trying was one that had been doing the rounds from as far back as the Juniors. And it came home to me, with a kind of chill, that Tommy had been going through what he\u0027d been going through not just for weeks or months, but for years. Tommy and I talked about all this not so long ago, and his own account of how his troubles began confirmed what I was thinking that night. According to him, it had all started one afternoon in one of Miss Geraldine\u0027s art classes. Until that day, Tommy told me, he\u0027d always quite enjoyed painting. But then that day in Miss Geraldine\u0027s class, Tommy had done this particular watercolour--of an elephant standing in some tall grass--and that was what started it all off. He\u0027d done it, he claimed, as a kind of joke. I quizzed him a lot on this point and I suspect the truth was that it was like a lot of things at that age: you don\u0027t have any clear reason, you just do it. You do it because you think it might get a laugh, or because you want to see if it\u0027ll cause a stir. And when you\u0027re asked to explain it afterwards, it doesn\u0027t seem to make any sense. We\u0027ve all done things like that. Tommy didn\u0027t quite put it this way, but I\u0027m sure that\u0027s how it happened. Anyway, he did his elephant, which was exactly the sort of picture a kid three years younger might have done. It took him no more than twenty minutes and it got a laugh, sure enough, though not quite the sort he\u0027d expected. Even so, it might not have led to anything--and this is a big irony, I suppose--if Miss Geraldine hadn\u0027t been taking the class that day. Miss Geraldine was everyone\u0027s favourite guardian when we were that age. She was gentle, soft-spoken, and always comforted you when you needed it, even when you\u0027d done something bad, or been told off by another guardian. If she ever had to tell you off herself, then for days afterwards she\u0027d give you lots of extra attention, like she owed you something. It was unlucky for Tommy that it was Miss Geraldine taking art that day and not, say, Mr. Robert or Miss Emily herself--the head guardian--who often took art. Had it been either of those two, Tommy would have got a bit of a telling off, he could have done his smirk, and the worst the others would have thought was that it was a feeble joke. He might even have had some students think him a right clown. But Miss Geraldine being Miss Geraldine, it didn\u0027t go that way. Instead, she did her best to look at the picture with kindness and understanding. And probably guessing Tommy was in danger of getting stick from the others, she went too far the other way, actually finding things to praise, pointing them out to the class. That was how the resentment started. \"After we left the room,\" Tommy remembered, \"that\u0027s when I first heard them talking. And they didn\u0027t care I could hear.\" My guess is that from some time before he did that elephant, Tommy had had the feeling he wasn\u0027t keeping up--that his painting in particular was like that of students much younger than him--and he\u0027d been covering up the best he could by doing deliberately childish pictures. But after the elephant painting, the whole thing had been brought into the open, and now everyone was watching to see what he did next. It seems he did make an effort for a while, but he\u0027d no sooner have started on something, there\u0027d be sneers and giggles all around him. In fact, the harder he tried, the more laughable his efforts turned out. So before long Tommy had gone back to his original defence, producing work that seemed deliberately childish, work that said he couldn\u0027t care less. From there, the thing had got deeper and deeper. For a while he\u0027d only had to suffer during art lessons--though that was often enough, because we did a lot of art in the Juniors. But then it grew bigger. He got left out of games, boys refused to sit next to him at dinner, or pretended not to hear if he said anything in his dorm after lights-out. At first it wasn\u0027t so relentless. Months could go by without incident, he\u0027d think the whole thing was behind him, then something he did--or one of his enemies, like Arthur H.--would get it all going again. I\u0027m not sure when the big temper tantrums started. My own memory of it is that Tommy was always known for his temper, even in the Infants, but he claimed to me they only began after the teasing got bad. Anyway, it was those temper tantrums that really got people going, escalating everything, and around the time I\u0027m talking about--the summer of our Senior 2, when we were thirteen--that was when the persecution reached its peak. Then it all stopped, not overnight, but rapidly enough. I was, as I say, watching the situation closely around then, so I saw the signs before most of the others. It started with a period--it might have been a month, maybe longer--when the pranks went on pretty steadily, but Tommy failed to lose his temper. Sometimes I could see he was close to it, but he somehow controlled himself; other times, he\u0027d quietly shrug, or react like he hadn\u0027t noticed a thing. At first these responses caused disappointment; maybe people were resentful, even, like he\u0027d let them down. Then gradually, people got bored and the pranks became more halfhearted, until one day it struck me there hadn\u0027t been any for over a week. This wouldn\u0027t necessarily have been so significant by itself, but I\u0027d spotted other changes. Little things, like Alexander J. and Peter N. walking across the courtyard with him towards the fields, the three of them chatting quite naturally; a subtle but clear difference in people\u0027s voices when his name got mentioned. Then once, towards the end of an afternoon break, a group of us were sitting on the grass quite close to the South Playing Field where the boys, as usual, were playing their football. I was joining in our conversation, but keeping an eye on Tommy, who I noticed was right at the heart of the game. At one point he got tripped, and picking himself up, placed the ball on the ground to take the free kick himself. As the boys spread out in anticipation, I saw Arthur H.--one of his biggest tormentors--a few yards behind Tommy\u0027s back, begin mimicking him, doing a daft version of the way Tommy was standing over the ball, hands on hips. I watched carefully, but none of the others took up Arthur\u0027s cue. They must all have seen, because all eyes were looking towards Tommy, waiting for his kick, and Arthur was right behind him--but no one was interested. Tommy floated the ball across the grass, the game went on, and Arthur H. didn\u0027t try anything else. I was pleased about all these developments, but also mystified. There\u0027d been no real change in Tommy\u0027s work--his reputation for \"creativity\" was as low as ever. I could see that an end to the tantrums was a big help, but what seemed to be the key factor was harder to put your finger on. There was something about Tommy himself--the way he carried himself, the way he looked people in the face and talked in his open, good-natured way--that was different from before, and which had in turn changed the attitudes of those around him. But what had brought all this on wasn\u0027t clear. I was mystified, and decided to probe him a bit the next time we could talk in private. The chance came along before long, when I was lining up for lunch and spotted him a few places ahead in the queue. I suppose this might sound odd, but at Hailsham, the lunch queue was one of the better places to have a private talk. It was something to do with the acoustics in the Great Hall; all the hubbub and the high ceilings meant that so long as you lowered your voices, stood quite close, and made sure your neighbours were deep in their own chat, you had a fair chance of not being overheard. In any case, we weren\u0027t exactly spoilt for choice. \"Quiet\" places were often the worst, because there was always someone likely to be passing within earshot. And as soon as you looked like you were trying to sneak off for a secret talk, the whole place seemed to sense it within minutes, and you\u0027d have no chance. So when I saw Tommy a few places ahead of me, I waved him over--the rule being that though you couldn\u0027t jump the queue going forwards it was fine to go back. He came over with a delighted smile, and we stood together for a moment without saying much--not out of awkwardness, but because we were waiting for any interest aroused by Tommy\u0027s moving back to fade. Then I said to him: \"You seem much happier these days, Tommy. Things seem to be going much better for you.\" \"You notice everything, don\u0027t you, Kath?\" He said this completely without sarcasm. \"Yeah, everything\u0027s all right. I\u0027m getting on all right.\" \"So what\u0027s happened? Did you find God or something?\" \"God?\" Tommy was lost for a second. Then he laughed and said: \"Oh, I see. You\u0027re talking about me not... getting so angry.\" \"Not just that, Tommy. You\u0027ve turned things around for yourself. I\u0027ve been watching. So that\u0027s why I was asking.\" Tommy shrugged. \"I\u0027ve grown up a bit, I suppose. And maybe everyone else has too. Can\u0027t keep on with the same stuff all the time. Gets boring.\" I said nothing, but just kept looking right at him, until he gave another little laugh and said: \"Kath, you\u0027re so nosy. Okay, I suppose there is something. Something that happened. If you want, I\u0027ll tell you.\" \"Well, go on then.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you, Kath, but you mustn\u0027t spread it, all right? A couple of months back, I had this talk with Miss Lucy. And I felt much better afterwards. It\u0027s hard to explain. But she said something, and it all felt much better.\" \"So what did she say?\" \"Well... The thing is, it might sound strange. It did to me at first. What she said was that if I didn\u0027t want to be creative, if I really didn\u0027t feel like it, that was perfectly all right. Nothing wrong with it, she said.\" \"That\u0027s what she told you?\" Tommy nodded, but I was already turning away. \"That\u0027s just rubbish, Tommy. If you\u0027re going to play stupid games, I can\u0027t be bothered.\" I was genuinely angry, because I thought he was lying to me, just when I deserved to be taken into his confidence. Spotting a girl I knew a few places back, I went over to her, leaving Tommy standing. I could see he was bewildered and crestfallen, but after the months I\u0027d spent worrying about him, I felt betrayed, and didn\u0027t care how he felt. I chatted with my friend--I think it was Matilda--as cheerfully as possible, and hardly looked his way for the rest of the time we were in the queue. But as I was carrying my plate to the tables, Tommy came up behind me and said quickly: \"Kath, I wasn\u0027t trying to pull your leg, if that\u0027s what you think. It\u0027s what happened. I\u0027ll tell you about it if you give me half a chance.\" \"Don\u0027t talk rubbish, Tommy.\" \"Kath, I\u0027ll tell you about it. I\u0027ll be down at the pond after lunch. If you come down there, I\u0027ll tell you.\" I gave him a reproachful look and walked off without responding, but already, I suppose, I\u0027d begun to entertain the possibility that he wasn\u0027t, after all, making it up about Miss Lucy. And by the time I sat down with my friends, I was trying to figure out how I could sneak off afterwards down to the pond without getting everyone curious.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372/904.html","bookId":311,"book":{"id":311,"title":"别让我走 Never let me go","description":"简介： 一段令人心碎、惴惴不安的爱情故事，勾勒出一幅阐明人性的脆弱与希望、寻找乡关何处的宿命风景，而在平凡寻常文字间，呈现惊人真相的悬疑推理画面 海尔森表面上看来是一所迷人...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110906/1-110Z6102914c2.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
