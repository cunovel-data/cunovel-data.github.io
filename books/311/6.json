{"id":23192,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"I think I\u0027d have felt better about what had happened if Ruth had held it against me in some obvious way. But this was one instance when she seemed just to cave in. It was like she was too ashamed of the matter--too crushed by it--even to be angry or to want to get me back. The first few times I saw her after the conversation under the eaves, I was ready for at least a bit of huffiness, but no, she was completely civil, if a little flat. It occurred to me she was scared I\u0027d expose her--the pencil case, sure enough, vanished from view--and I wanted to tell her she\u0027d nothing to fear from me. The trouble was, because none of this had actually been talked about in the open, I couldn\u0027t find a way of bringing it all up with her.\\n\\n I did my best, meanwhile, to take any opportunity to imply to Ruth she had a special place in Miss Geraldine\u0027s heart. There was the time, for example, when a bunch of us were desperate to go out and practise rounders during break, because we\u0027d been challenged by a group from the year above. Our problem was that it was raining, and it looked unlikely we\u0027d be allowed outside. I noticed though that Miss Geraldine was one of the guardians on duty, and so I said: \"If Ruth goes and asks Miss Geraldine, then we\u0027d stand a chance.\"\\n\\n As far as I remember, this suggestion wasn\u0027t taken up; maybe hardly anyone heard it, because a lot of us were talking all at once. But the point is, I said it standing right behind Ruth, and I could see she was pleased.\\n\\n Then another time a few of us were leaving a classroom with Miss Geraldine, and I happened to find myself about to go out the door right after Miss Geraldine herself. What I did was to slow right down so that Ruth, coming behind me, could instead pass through the door beside Miss Geraldine. I did this without any fuss, as though this were the natural and proper thing and what Miss Geraldine would like--just the way I\u0027d have done if, say, I\u0027d accidentally got myself between two best friends. On that occasion, as far as I remember, Ruth looked puzzled and surprised for a split second, then gave me a quick nod and went past.\\n\\n Little things like these might well have pleased Ruth, but they were still far removed from what had actually happened between us under the eaves that foggy day, and the sense that I\u0027d never be able to sort things just continued to grow. There\u0027s a particular memory I have of sitting by myself one evening on one of the benches outside the pavilion, trying over and over to think of some way out, while a heavy mix of remorse and frustration brought me virtually to tears. If things had stayed that way, I\u0027m not sure what would have happened. Maybe it would all have got forgotten eventually; or maybe Ruth and I would have drifted apart. As it was, right out of the blue, a chance came along for me to put things right.\\n\\n We were in the middle of one of Mr. Roger\u0027s art lessons, except for some reason he\u0027d gone out half way. So we were all just drifting about among the easels, chatting and looking at each other\u0027s work. Then at one point a girl called Midge A. came over to where we were and said to Ruth, in a perfectly friendly way: \"Where\u0027s your pencil case? It\u0027s so luscious.\"\\n\\n Ruth tensed and glanced quickly about to see who was present. It was our usual gang with perhaps a couple of outsiders loitering nearby. I hadn\u0027t mentioned to a soul anything about the Sales Register business, but I suppose Ruth wasn\u0027t to know that. Her voice was softer than usual when she replied to Midge: \"I haven\u0027t got it here. I keep it in my collection chest.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so luscious. Where did you get it?\"\\n\\n Midge was quizzing her completely innocently, that was now obvious. But almost all of us who\u0027d been in Room 5 the time Ruth had first brought out the pencil case were here now, looking on, and I saw Ruth hesitate. It was only later, when I replayed it all, that I appreciated how perfectly shaped a chance it was for me. At the time I didn\u0027t really think. I just came in before Midge or anyone else had the chance to notice Ruth was in a curious quandary.\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t say where it came from.\"\\n\\n Ruth, Midge, the rest of them, they all looked at me, maybe a little surprised. But I kept my cool and went on, addressing only Midge.\\n\\n \"There are some very good reasons why we can\u0027t tell you where it came from.\"\\n\\n Midge shrugged. \"So it\u0027s a mystery.\"\\n\\n \"A big mystery,\" I said, then gave her a smile to show her I wasn\u0027t trying to be nasty to her.\\n\\n The others were nodding to back me up, though Ruth herself had on a vague expression, like she\u0027d suddenly become preoccupied with something else entirely. Midge shrugged again, and as far as I remember that was the end of it. Either she walked off, or else she started talking about something different.\\n\\n Now, for much the same reasons I\u0027d not been able to talk openly to Ruth about what I\u0027d done to her over the Sales Register business, she of course wasn\u0027t able to thank me for the way I\u0027d intervened with Midge. But it was obvious from her manner towards me, not just over the next few days, but over the weeks that followed, how pleased she was with me. And having recently been in much the same position, it was easy to recognise the signs of her looking around for some opportunity to do something nice, something really special for me. It was a good feeling, and I remember even thinking once or twice how it would be better if she didn\u0027t get a chance for ages, just so the good feeling between us could go on and on. As it was, an opportunity did come along for her, about a month after the Midge episode, the time I lost my favourite tape. f I STILL HAVE A COPY OF THAT TAPE and until recently I\u0027d listen to it occasionally driving out in the open country on a drizzly day. But now the tape machine in my car\u0027s got so dodgy, I don\u0027t dare play it in that. And there never seems enough time to play it when I\u0027m back in my bedsit. Even so, it\u0027s one of my most precious possessions. Maybe come the end of the year, when I\u0027m no longer a carer, I\u0027ll be able to listen to it more often.\\n\\n The album\u0027s called Songs After Dark and it\u0027s by Judy Bridgewater. What I\u0027ve got today isn\u0027t the actual cassette, the one I had back then at Hailsham, the one I lost. It\u0027s the one Tommy and I found in Norfolk years afterwards--but that\u0027s another story I\u0027ll come to later. What I want to talk about is the first tape, the one that disappeared.\\n\\n I should explain before I go any further this whole thing we had in those days about Norfolk. We kept it going for years and years--it became a sort of in-joke, I suppose--and it all started from one particular lesson we had when we were pretty young.\\n\\n It was Miss Emily herself who taught us about the different counties of England. She\u0027d pin up a big map over the blackboard, and next to it, set up an easel. And if she was talking about, say, Oxfordshire, she\u0027d place on the easel a large calendar with photos of the county. She had quite a collection of these picture calendars, and we got through most of the counties this way. She\u0027d tap a spot on the map with her pointer, turn to the easel and reveal another picture. There\u0027d be little villages with streams going through them, white monuments on hillsides, old churches beside fields; if she was telling us about a coastal place, there\u0027d be beaches crowded with people, cliffs with seagulls. I suppose she wanted us to have a grasp of what was out there surrounding us, and it\u0027s amazing, even now, after all these miles I\u0027ve covered as a carer, the extent to which my idea of the various counties is still set by these pictures Miss Emily put up on her easel. I\u0027d be driving through Derbyshire, say, and catch myself looking for a particular village green with a mock-Tudor pub and a war memorial--and realise it\u0027s the image Miss Emily showed us the first time I ever heard of Derbyshire.\\n\\n Anyway, the point is, there was a gap in Miss Emily\u0027s calendar collection: none of them had a single picture of Norfolk. We had these same lectures repeated a number of times, and I\u0027d always wonder if this time she\u0027d found a picture of Norfolk, but it was always the same. She\u0027d wave her pointer over the map and say, as a sort of afterthought: \"And over here, we\u0027ve got Norfolk. Very nice there.\"\\n\\n Then, that particular time, I remember how she paused and drifted off into thought, maybe because she hadn\u0027t planned what should happen next instead of a picture. Eventually she came out of her dream and tapped the map again.\\n\\n \"You see, because it\u0027s stuck out here on the east, on this hump jutting into the sea, it\u0027s not on the way to anywhere. People going north and south\"--she moved the pointer up and down--\"they bypass it altogether. For that reason, it\u0027s a peaceful corner of England, rather nice. But it\u0027s also something of a lost corner.\"\\n\\n A lost corner. That\u0027s what she called it, and that was what started it. Because at Hailsham, we had our own \"Lost Corner\" up on the third floor, where the lost property was kept; if you lost or found anything, that\u0027s where you went. Someone--I can\u0027t remember who it was--claimed after the lesson that what Miss Emily had said was that Norfolk was England\u0027s \"lost corner,\" where all the lost property found in the country ended up. Somehow this idea caught on and soon had become accepted fact virtually throughout our entire year.\\n\\n Not long ago, when Tommy and I were reminiscing about all of this, he thought we\u0027d never really believed in the notion, that it was a joke right from the start. But I\u0027m pretty certain he was wrong there. Sure enough, by the time we were twelve or thirteen, the Norfolk thing had become a big joke. But my memory of it--and Ruth remembered it the same way--is that at the beginning, we believed in Norfolk in the most literal way; that just as lorries came to Hailsham with our food and stuff for our Sales, there was some similar operation going on, except on a grander scale, with vehicles moving all over England, delivering anything left behind in fields and trains to this place called Norfolk. The fact that we\u0027d never seen a picture of the place only added to its mystique.\\n\\n This might all sound daft, but you have to remember that to us, at that stage in our lives, any place beyond Hailsham was like a fantasy land; we had only the haziest notions of the world outside and about what was and wasn\u0027t possible there. Besides, we never bothered to examine our Norfolk theory in any detail. What was important to us, as Ruth said one evening when we were sitting in that tiled room in Dover, looking out at the sunset, was that \"when we lost something precious, and we\u0027d looked and looked and still couldn\u0027t find it, then we didn\u0027t have to be completely heartbroken. We still had that last bit of comfort, thinking one day, when we were grown up, and we were free to travel around the country, we could always go and find it again in Norfolk.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m sure Ruth was right about that. Norfolk came to be a real source of comfort for us, probably much more than we admitted at the time, and that was why we were still talking about it--albeit as a sort of joke--when we were much older. And that\u0027s why, years and years later, that day Tommy and I found another copy of that lost tape of mine in a town on the Norfolk coast, we didn\u0027t just think it pretty funny; we both felt deep down some tug, some old wish to believe again in something that was once close to our hearts.\\n\\n \\n\\n BUT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT MY TAPE, Songs After Dark by Judy Bridgewater. I suppose it was originally an LP--the recording date\u0027s 1956--but what I had was the cassette, and the cover picture was what must have been a scaled-down version of the record sleeve. Judy Bridgewater is wearing a purple satin dress, one of those off-the-shoulder ones popular in those days, and you can see her from just above the waist because she\u0027s sitting on a bar-stool. I think it\u0027s supposed to be South America, because there are palms behind her and swarthy waiters in white tuxedos. You\u0027re looking at Judy from exactly where the barman would be when he\u0027s serving her drinks. She\u0027s looking back in a friendly, not too sexy way, like she might be flirting just a tiny bit, but you\u0027re someone she knows from way back. Now the other thing about this cover is that Judy\u0027s got her elbows up on the bar and there\u0027s a cigarette burning in her hand. And it was because of this cigarette that I got so secretive about the tape, right from the moment I found it at the Sale.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how it was where you were, but at Hailsham the guardians were really strict about smoking. I\u0027m sure they\u0027d have preferred it if we never found out smoking even existed; but since this wasn\u0027t possible, they made sure to give us some sort of lecture each time any reference to cigarettes came along. Even if we were being shown a picture of a famous writer or world leader, and they happened to have a cigarette in their hand, then the whole lesson would grind to a halt. There was even a rumour that some classic books--like the Sherlock Holmes ones--weren\u0027t in our library because the main characters smoked too much, and when you came across a page torn out of an illustrated book or magazine, this was because there\u0027d been a picture on it of someone smoking. And then there were the actual lessons where they showed us horrible pictures of what smoking did to the insides of your body. That\u0027s why it was such a shock that time Marge K. asked Miss Lucy her question.\\n\\n We were sitting on the grass after a rounders match and Miss Lucy had been giving us a typical talk on smoking when Marge suddenly asked if Miss Lucy had herself ever had a cigarette. Miss Lucy went quiet for a few seconds. Then she said: \"I\u0027d like to be able to say no. But to be honest, I did smoke for a little while. For about two years, when I was younger.\"\\n\\n You can imagine what a shock this was. Before Miss Lucy\u0027s reply, we\u0027d all been glaring at Marge, really furious she\u0027d asked such a rude question--to us, she might as well have asked if Miss Lucy had ever attacked anyone with an axe. And for days afterwards I remember how we made Marge\u0027s life an utter misery; in fact, that incident I mentioned before, the night we held Marge\u0027s face to the dorm window to make her look at the woods, that was all part of what came afterwards. But at the time, the moment Miss Lucy said what she did, we were too confused to think any more about Marge. I think we all just stared at Miss Lucy in horror, waiting for what she\u0027d say next.\\n\\n When she did speak, Miss Lucy seemed to be weighing up each word carefully. \"It\u0027s not good that I smoked. It wasn\u0027t good for me so I stopped it. But what you must understand is that for you, all of you, it\u0027s much, much worse to smoke than it ever was for me.\"\\n\\n Then she paused and went quiet. Someone said later she\u0027d gone off into a daydream, but I was pretty sure, as was Ruth, that she was thinking hard about what to say next. Finally she said: \"You\u0027ve been told about it. You\u0027re students. You\u0027re... special. So keeping yourselves well, keeping yourselves very healthy inside, that\u0027s much more important for each of you than it is for me.\"\\n\\n She stopped again and looked at us in a strange way. Afterwards, when we discussed it, some of us were sure she was dying for someone to ask: \"Why? Why is it so much worse for us?\" But no one did. I\u0027ve often thought about that day, and I\u0027m sure now, in the light of what happened later, that we only needed to ask and Miss Lucy would have told us all kinds of things. All it would have taken was just one more question about smoking.\\n\\n So why had we stayed silent that day? I suppose it was because even at that age--we were nine or ten--we knew just enough to make us wary of that whole territory. It\u0027s hard now to remember just how much we knew by then. We certainly knew--though not in any deep sense--that we were different from our guardians, and also from the normal people outside; we perhaps even knew that a long way down the line there were donations waiting for us. But we didn\u0027t really know what that meant. If we were keen to avoid certain topics, it was probably more because it embarrassed us. We hated the way our guardians, usually so on top of everything, became so awkward whenever we came near this territory. It unnerved us to see them change like that. I think that\u0027s why we never asked that one further question, and why we punished Marge K. so cruelly for bringing it all up that day after the rounders match. l ANYWAY, THAT\u0027S WHY I WAS SO SECRETIVE about my tape. I even turned the cover inside out so you\u0027d only see Judy and her cigarette if you opened up the plastic case. But the reason the tape meant so much to me had nothing to do with the cigarette, or even with the way Judy Bridgewater sang--she\u0027s one of those singers from her time, cocktail-bar stuff, not the sort of thing any of us at Hailsham liked. What made the tape so special for me was this one particular song: track number three, \"Never Let Me Go.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s slow and late night and American, and there\u0027s a bit that keeps coming round when Judy sings: \"Never let me go... Oh baby, baby... Never let me go...\" I was eleven then, and hadn\u0027t listened to much music, but this one song, it really got to me. I always tried to keep the tape wound to just that spot so I could play the song whenever a chance came by.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have so many opportunities, mind you, this being a few years before Walkmans started appearing at the Sales. There was a big machine in the billiards room, but I hardly ever played the tape in there because it was always full of people. The Art Room also had a player, but that was usually just as noisy. The only place I could listen properly was in our dorm.\\n\\n By then we\u0027d gone into the small six-bed dorms over in the separate huts, and in ours we had a portable cassette player up on the shelf above the radiator. So that\u0027s where I used to go, in the day when no one else was likely to be about, to play my song over and over.\\n\\n What was so special about this song? Well, the thing was, I didn\u0027t used to listen properly to the words; I just waited for that bit that went: \"Baby, baby, never let me go...\" And what I\u0027d imagine was a woman who\u0027d been told she couldn\u0027t have babies, who\u0027d really, really wanted them all her life. Then there\u0027s a sort of miracle and she has a baby, and she holds this baby very close to her and walks around singing: \"Baby, never let me go...\" partly because she\u0027s so happy, but also because she\u0027s so afraid something will happen, that the baby will get ill or be taken away from her. Even at the time, I realised this couldn\u0027t be right, that this interpretation didn\u0027t fit with the rest of the lyrics. But that wasn\u0027t an issue with me. The song was about what I said, and I used to listen to it again and again, on my own, whenever I got the chance.\\n\\n There was one strange incident around this time I should tell you about here. It really unsettled me, and although I wasn\u0027t to find out its real meaning until years later, I think I sensed, even then, some deeper significance to it.\\n\\n It was a sunny afternoon and I\u0027d gone to our dorm to get something. I remember how bright it was because the curtains in our room hadn\u0027t been pulled back properly, and you could see the sun coming in in big shafts and see all the dust in the air. I hadn\u0027t meant to play the tape, but since I was there all by myself, an impulse made me get the cassette out of my collection box and put it into the player.\\n\\n Maybe the volume had been turned right up by whoever had been using it last, I don\u0027t know. But it was much louder than I usually had it and that was probably why I didn\u0027t hear her before I did. Or maybe I\u0027d just got complacent by then. Anyway, what I was doing was swaying about slowly in time to the song, holding an imaginary baby to my breast. In fact, to make it all the more embarrassing, it was one of those times I\u0027d grabbed a pillow to stand in for the baby, and I was doing this slow dance, my eyes closed, singing along softly each time those lines came around again: \"Oh baby, baby, never let me go...\"\\n\\n The song was almost over when something made me realise I wasn\u0027t alone, and I opened my eyes to find myself staring at Madame framed in the doorway.\\n\\n I froze in shock. Then within a second or two, I began to feel a new kind of alarm, because I could see there was something strange about the situation. The door was almost half open--it was a sort of rule we couldn\u0027t close dorm doors completely except for when we were sleeping--but Madame hadn\u0027t nearly come up to the threshold. She was out in the corridor, standing very still, her head angled to one side to give her a view of what I was doing inside. And the odd thing was she was crying. It might even have been one of her sobs that had come through the song to jerk me out of my dream.\\n\\n When I think about this now, it seems to me, even if she wasn\u0027t a guardian, she was the adult, and she should have said or done something, even if it was just to tell me off. Then I\u0027d have known how to behave. But she just went on standing out there, sobbing and sobbing, staring at me through the doorway with that same look in her eyes she always had when she looked at us, like she was seeing something that gave her the creeps. Except this time there was something else, something extra in that look I couldn\u0027t fathom.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what to do or say, or what to expect next. Perhaps she would come into the room, shout at me, hit me even, I didn\u0027t have a clue. As it was, she turned and the next moment I could hear her footsteps leaving the hut. I realised the tape had gone on to the next track, and I turned it off and sat down on the nearest bed. And as I did so, I saw through the window in front of me her figure hurrying off towards the main house. She didn\u0027t glance back, but I could tell from the way her back was hunched up she was still sobbing.\\n\\n When I got back to my friends a few minutes later, I didn\u0027t tell them anything about what had happened. Someone noticed I wasn\u0027t right and said something, but I just shrugged and kept quiet. I wasn\u0027t ashamed exactly: but it was a bit like that earlier time, when we\u0027d all waylaid Madame in the courtyard as she got out of her car. What I wished more than anything was that the thing hadn\u0027t happened at all, and I thought that by not mentioning it I\u0027d be doing myself and everyone else a favour.\\n\\n I did, though, talk to Tommy about it a couple of years later. This was in those days following our conversation by the pond when he\u0027d first confided in me about Miss Lucy; the days during which--as I see it--we started off our whole thing of wondering and asking questions about ourselves that we kept going between us through the years. When I told Tommy about what had happened with Madame in the dorm, he came up with a fairly simple explanation. By then, of course, we all knew something I hadn\u0027t known back then, which was that none of us could have babies. It\u0027s just possible I\u0027d somehow picked up the idea when I was younger without fully registering it, and that\u0027s why I heard what I did when I listened to that song. But there was no way I\u0027d known properly back then. As I say, by the time Tommy and I were discussing it, we\u0027d all been told clearly enough. None of us, incidentally, was particularly bothered about it; in fact, I remember some people being pleased we could have sex without worrying about all of that--though proper sex was still some way off for most of us at that stage. Anyway, when I told Tommy about what had happened, he said: \"Madame\u0027s probably not a bad person, even though she\u0027s creepy. So when she saw you dancing like that, holding your baby, she thought it was really tragic, how you couldn\u0027t have babies. That\u0027s why she started crying.\"\\n\\n \"But Tommy,\" I pointed out, \"how could she have known the song had anything to do with people having babies? How could she have known the pillow I was holding was supposed to be a baby? That was only in my head.\"\\n\\n Tommy thought about this, then said only half jokingly: \"Maybe Madame can read minds. She\u0027s strange. Maybe she can see right inside you. It wouldn\u0027t surprise me.\"\\n\\n This gave us both a little chill, and though we giggled, we didn\u0027t say any more about it.\\n\\n \\n\\n THE TAPE DISAPPEARED a couple of months after the incident with Madame. I never linked the two events at the time and I\u0027ve no reason to link them now. I was in the dorm one night, just before lights-out, and was rummaging through my collection chest to pass the time until the others came back from the bathroom. It\u0027s odd but when it first dawned on me the tape wasn\u0027t there any more, my main thought was that I mustn\u0027t give away how panicked I was. I can remember actually making a point of humming absent-mindedly while I went on searching. I\u0027ve thought about it a lot and I still don\u0027t know how to explain it: these were my closest friends in that room with me and yet I didn\u0027t want them to know how upset I was about my tape going missing.\\n\\n I suppose it had something to do with it being a secret, just how much it had meant to me. Maybe all of us at Hailsham had little secrets like that--little private nooks created out of thin air where we could go off alone with our fears and longings. But the very fact that we had such needs would have felt wrong to us at the time--like somehow we were letting the side down.\\n\\n Anyway, once I was quite sure the tape was gone, I asked each of the others in the dorm, very casually, if they\u0027d seen it. I wasn\u0027t yet completely distraught because there was just the chance I\u0027d left it in the billiards room; otherwise my hope was that someone had borrowed it and would give it back in the morning.\\n\\n Well, the tape didn\u0027t turn up the next day and I\u0027ve still no idea what happened to it. The truth is, I suppose, there was far more thieving going on at Hailsham than we--or the guardians--ever wanted to admit. But the reason I\u0027m going into all this now is to explain about Ruth and how she reacted. What you have to remember is that I lost my tape less than a month after that time Midge had quizzed Ruth in the Art Room about her pencil case and I\u0027d come to the rescue. Ever since, as I told you, Ruth had been looking out for something nice to do for me in return, and the tape disappearing gave her a real opportunity. You could even say it wasn\u0027t until after my tape vanished that things got back to normal with us--maybe for the first time since that rainy morning I\u0027d mentioned the Sales Register to her under the eaves of the main house.\\n\\n The night I first noticed the tape had gone, I\u0027d made sure to ask everyone about it, and that of course had included Ruth. Looking back, I can see how she must have realised, then and there, exactly what losing the tape meant to me, and at the same time, how important it was for me there was no fuss. So she\u0027d replied that night with a distracted shrug and gone on with what she was doing. But the next morning, when I was coming back from the bathroom, I could hear her--in a casual voice like it wasn\u0027t anything much--asking Hannah if she was sure she hadn\u0027t seen my tape.\\n\\n Then maybe a fortnight later, when I\u0027d long reconciled myself to having truly lost my tape, she came and found me during the lunch break. It was one of the first really good days of spring that year, and I\u0027d been sitting on the grass talking with a couple of the older girls. When Ruth came up and asked if I wanted to go for a little stroll, it was obvious she had something particular on her mind. So I left the older girls and followed her to the edge of the North Playing Field, then up the north hill, until we were standing there by the wooden fence looking down on the sweep of green dotted with clusters of students. There was a strong breeze at the top of the hill, and I remember being surprised by it because I hadn\u0027t noticed it down on the grass. We stood there looking over the grounds for a while, then she held out a little bag to me. When I took it, I could tell there was a cassette tape inside and my heart leapt. But Ruth said immediately: \"Kathy, it\u0027s not your one. The one you lost. I tried to find it for you, but it\u0027s really gone.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Gone to Norfolk.\"\\n\\n We both laughed. Then I took the tape out of the bag with a disappointed air, and I\u0027m not sure the disappointment wasn\u0027t still there on my face while I examined it.\\n\\n I was holding something called Twenty Classic Dance Tunes. When I played it later, I discovered it was orchestra stuff for ballroom dancing. Of course, the moment she was giving it to me, I didn\u0027t know what sort of music it was, but I did know it wasn\u0027t anything like Judy Bridgewater. Then again, almost immediately, I saw how Ruth wasn\u0027t to know that--how to Ruth, who didn\u0027t know the first thing about music, this tape might easily make up for the one I\u0027d lost. And suddenly I felt the disappointment ebbing away and being replaced by a real happiness. We didn\u0027t do things like hug each other much at Hailsham. But I squeezed one of her hands in both mine when I thanked her. She said: \"I found it at the last Sale. I just thought it\u0027s the sort of thing you\u0027d like.\" And I said that, yes, it was exactly the sort of thing.\\n\\n I still have it now. I don\u0027t play it much because the music has nothing to do with anything. It\u0027s an object, like a brooch or a ring, and especially now Ruth has gone, it\u0027s become one of my most precious possessions.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372/908.html","bookId":311,"book":{"id":311,"title":"别让我走 Never let me go","description":"简介： 一段令人心碎、惴惴不安的爱情故事，勾勒出一幅阐明人性的脆弱与希望、寻找乡关何处的宿命风景，而在平凡寻常文字间，呈现惊人真相的悬疑推理画面 海尔森表面上看来是一所迷人...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110906/1-110Z6102914c2.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
