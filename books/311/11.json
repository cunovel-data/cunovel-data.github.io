{"id":23197,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"I should explain why I got so bothered by Ruth saying what she did. Those early months at the Cottages had been a strange time in our friendship. We were quarrelling over all kinds of little things, but at the same time we were confiding in each other more than ever. In particular, we used to have these talks, the two of us, usually up in my room at the top of the Black Barn just before going to bed. You could say they were a sort of hangover from those talks in our dorm after lights out. Anyway, the thing was, however much we might have fallen out during the day, come bed-time, Ruth and I would still find ourselves sitting side by side on my mattress, sipping our hot drinks, exchanging our deepest feelings about our new life like nothing had ever come between us. And what made these heart-to-hearts possible--you might even say what made the whole friendship possible during that time--was this understanding we had that anything we told each other during these moments would be treated with careful respect: that we\u0027d honour confidences, and that no matter how much we rowed, we wouldn\u0027t use against each other anything we\u0027d talked about during those sessions. Okay, this had never been spelt out exactly, but it was definitely, as I say, an understanding, and until the afternoon of the Daniel Deronda business, neither of us had come anywhere near breaching it. That was why, when Ruth said what she did about my not being slow making friends with certain veterans, I wasn\u0027t just cross. To me, it was a betrayal. Because there wasn\u0027t any doubt what she\u0027d meant by it; she was referring to something I\u0027d confided in her one night about me and sex.\\n\\n As you\u0027d expect, sex was different at the Cottages from how it had been at Hailsham. It was a lot more straightforward--more \"grown up.\" You didn\u0027t go around gossiping and giggling about who\u0027d been doing it with whom. If you knew two students had had sex, you didn\u0027t immediately start speculating about whether they\u0027d become a proper couple. And if a new couple did emerge one day, you didn\u0027t go around talking about it like it was a big event. You just accepted it quietly, and from then on, when you referred to one, you also referred to the other, as in \"Chrissie and Rodney\" or \"Ruth and Tommy.\" When someone wanted sex with you, that too was much more straightforward. A boy would come up and ask if you wanted to spend the night in his room \"for a change,\" something like that, it was no big deal. Sometimes it was because he was interested in becoming a couple with you; other times it was just for a one-nighter.\\n\\n The atmosphere, like I say, was much more grown up. But when I look back, the sex at the Cottages seems a bit functional. Maybe it was precisely because all the gossip and secrecy had gone. Or maybe it was because of the cold.\\n\\n When I remember sex at the Cottages, I think about doing it in freezing rooms in the pitch dark, usually under a ton of blankets. And the blankets often weren\u0027t even blankets, but a really odd assortment--old curtains, even bits of carpet. Sometimes it got so cold you just had to pile anything you could over you, and if you were having sex at the bottom of it, it felt like a mountain of bedding was pounding at you, so that half the time you weren\u0027t sure if you were doing it with the boy or all that stuff.\\n\\n Anyway, the point is, I\u0027d had a few one-nighters shortly after getting to the Cottages. I hadn\u0027t planned it that way. My plan had been to take my time, maybe become part of a couple with someone I chose carefully. I\u0027d never been in a couple before, and especially after watching Ruth and Tommy for a while, I was quite curious to give it a try for myself. As I say, that had been my plan, and when the one-nighters kept happening, it unsettled me a bit. That was why I\u0027d decided to confide in Ruth that night.\\n\\n It was in many ways a typical evening session for us. We\u0027d brought up our mugs of tea, and we were sitting in my room, side by side on the mattress, our heads slightly stooped because of the rafters. We talked about the different boys at the Cottages, and whether any of them might be right for me. And Ruth had been at her best: encouraging, funny, tactful, wise. That\u0027s why I decided to tell her about the one-nighters. I told her how they\u0027d happened without my really wanting them to; and how, even though we couldn\u0027t have babies from doing it, the sex had done funny things to my feelings, just as Miss Emily had warned. Then I said to her: \"Ruth, I wanted to ask you. Do you ever get so you just really have to do it? With anybody almost?\"\\n\\n Ruth shrugged, then said: \"I\u0027m in a couple. So if I want to do it, I just do it with Tommy.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose so. Maybe it\u0027s just me anyway. There might be something not quite right with me, down there. Because sometimes I just really, really need to do it.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s strange, Kathy.\" She fixed me with a concerned look, which made me feel all the more worried.\\n\\n \"So you don\u0027t ever get like that.\"\\n\\n She shrugged again. \"Not so as I\u0027d do it with just anybody. What you\u0027re saying does sound a bit weird, Kathy. But maybe it\u0027ll calm down after a while.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes it won\u0027t be there for ages. Then it suddenly comes on. It was like that, the first time it happened. He started snogging me and I just wanted him to get off. Then suddenly it just came on, out of nowhere. I just really had to do it.\"\\n\\n Ruth shook her head. \"It does sound a bit weird. But it\u0027ll probably go away. It\u0027s probably just to do with the different food we\u0027re eating here.\"\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t been a huge help, but she\u0027d been sympathetic and I\u0027d felt a little better about it all afterwards. That\u0027s why it was such a jolt to have Ruth suddenly bring it up the way she did in the middle of the argument we were having that afternoon in the field. Okay, there was probably no one to overhear us, but even so, there was something not at all right about what she\u0027d done. In those first months at the Cottages, our friendship had stayed intact because, on my side at least, I\u0027d had this notion there were two quite separate Ruths. There was one Ruth who was always trying to impress the veterans, who wouldn\u0027t hesitate to ignore me, Tommy, any of the others, if she thought we\u0027d cramp her style. This was the Ruth I wasn\u0027t pleased with, the one I could see every day putting on airs and pretending--the Ruth who did the slap-on-the-elbow gesture. But the Ruth who sat beside me in my little attic room at the day\u0027s close, legs outstretched over the edge of my mattress, her steaming mug held in both her hands, that was the Ruth from Hailsham, and whatever had been happening during the day, I could just pick up with her where we\u0027d left off the last time we\u0027d sat together like that. And until that afternoon in the field, there\u0027d been a definite understanding these two Ruths wouldn\u0027t merge; that the one I confided in before bed was one I could absolutely trust. That\u0027s why when she said that, about my \"not being slow making friends with at least some of the veterans,\" I got so upset. That\u0027s why I just picked up my book and walked off.\\n\\n But when I think about it now, I can see things more from Ruth\u0027s viewpoint. I can see, for instance, how she might have felt I had been the one to first violate an understanding, and that her little dig had just been a retaliation. This never occurred to me at the time, but I see now it\u0027s a possibility, and an explanation for what happened. After all, immediately before she made that remark, I\u0027d been talking about the arm-slapping business. Now it\u0027s a bit hard to explain this, but some sort of understanding had definitely developed between the two of us about the way Ruth behaved in front of the veterans. Okay, she often bluffed and implied all sorts of things I knew weren\u0027t true. Sometimes, as I said, she did things to impress the veterans at our expense. But it seems to me Ruth believed, at some level, she was doing all this on behalf of us all. And my role, as her closest friend, was to give her silent support, as if I was in the front row of the audience when she was performing on stage. She was struggling to become someone else, and maybe felt the pressure more than the rest of us because, as I say, she\u0027d somehow taken on the responsibility for all of us. In that case, then, the way I\u0027d talked about her slap on the elbow thing could be seen as a betrayal, and she might well then have felt justified retaliating as she had. As I say, this explanation only occurred to me recently. At the time I didn\u0027t look at the larger picture or at my own part in it. I suppose, in general, I never appreciated in those days the sheer effort Ruth was making to move on, to grow up and leave Hailsham behind. Thinking about this now, I\u0027m reminded of something she told me once, when I was caring for her in the recovery centre at Dover. We\u0027d been sitting in her room, watching the sunset, as we so often did, enjoying the mineral water and biscuits I\u0027d brought, and I\u0027d been telling her how I still had most of my old Hailsham collection box safely stowed inside my pine chest in my bedsit. Then--I wasn\u0027t trying to lead onto anything, or make any kind of point--I just happened to say to her: \"You never had a collection after Hailsham, did you?\"\\n\\n Ruth, who was sitting up in bed, was quiet for a long time, the sunset falling over the tiled wall behind her. Then she said: \"Remember the guardians, before we left, how they kept reminding us we could take our collections with us. So I\u0027d taken everything out of my box and put it into this holdall bag. My plan was I\u0027d find a really good wooden box for it all once I got to the Cottages. But when we got there, I could see none of the veterans had collections. It was only us, it wasn\u0027t normal. We must all have realised it, I wasn\u0027t the only one, but we didn\u0027t really talk about it, did we? So I didn\u0027t go looking for a new box. My things all stayed in the holdall bag for months, then in the end I threw them away.\"\\n\\n I stared at her. \"You put your collection out with the rubbish?\"\\n\\n Ruth shook her head, and for the next few moments seemed to be going through in her mind all the different items in her collection. Finally she said: \"I put them all in a bin bag, but I couldn\u0027t stand the idea of putting them out with the rubbish. So I asked old Keffers, once when he was about to drive off, if he\u0027d take the bin bag to a shop. I knew about charity shops, I\u0027d found it all out. Keffers rummaged in the bag a bit, he didn\u0027t know what any of it was--why should he?--and he did this laugh and said no shop he knew would want stuff like that. And I said, but it\u0027s good stuff, really good stuff. And he could see I was getting a bit emotional, and he changed his tune then. He said something like: ‘All right, missy, I\u0027ll take it along to the Oxfam people.\u0027 Then he made a real effort and said: ‘Now I\u0027ve had a closer look, you\u0027re right, it is pretty good stuff!\u0027\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t very convincing though. I suppose he just took it away and put it in some bin somewhere. But at least I didn\u0027t have to know that.\" Then she smiled and said: \"You were different. I remember. You were never embarrassed about your collection and you kept it. I wish now I\u0027d done that too.\"\\n\\n What I\u0027m saying is that we were all of us struggling to adjust to our new life, and I suppose we all did things back then we later regretted. I was really upset by Ruth\u0027s remark at the time, but it\u0027s pointless now trying to judge her or anyone else for the way they behaved during those early days at the Cottages. f AS THE AUTUMN CAME ON, and I got more familiar with our surroundings, I began noticing things I\u0027d missed earlier. There was, for instance, the odd attitude to students who\u0027d recently left. The veterans were never slow coming out with funny anecdotes about characters they\u0027d met on trips to the White Mansion or to Poplar Farm; but they hardly ever mentioned students who, right up until just before we\u0027d arrived, must have been their intimate friends.\\n\\n Another thing I noticed--and I could see it tied in--was the big hush that would descend around certain veterans when they went off on \"courses\"--which even we knew had to do with becoming carers. They could be gone for four or five days, but were hardly mentioned in that time; and when they came back, no one really asked them anything. I suppose they might have talked to their closest friends in private. But there was definitely an understanding that you didn\u0027t mention these trips out in the open. I can remember one morning watching, through the misted-up windows of our kitchen, two veterans leaving for a course, and wondering if by the next spring or summer, they\u0027d have gone altogether, and we\u0027d be taking care not to mention them.\\n\\n But it\u0027s perhaps stretching it to claim students who\u0027d left were an actual taboo. If they had to be mentioned, they got mentioned. Most commonly, you\u0027d hear them referred to indirectly, in connection with an object or a chore. For example, if repairs were needed to a downpipe, there\u0027d be a lot of discussion about \"the way Mike used to do it.\" And there was a tree stump outside the Black Barn everyone called \"Dave\u0027s stump\" because for over three years, until a few weeks before our arrival, he\u0027d sat on it to read and write, sometimes even when it was raining or cold. Then, maybe most memorably, there was Steve. None of us ever discovered anything much about the sort of person Steve had been--except that he\u0027d liked porn magazines.\\n\\n Every now and again, you\u0027d come across a porn mag at the Cottages, thrown behind a sofa or amidst a pile of old newspapers. They were what you\u0027d call \"soft\" porn, though we didn\u0027t know about such distinctions then. We\u0027d never come across anything like that before and didn\u0027t know what to think. The veterans usually laughed when one showed up and flicked through it quickly in a blasé way before throwing it aside, so we did the same. When Ruth and I were remembering all this a few years ago, she claimed there were dozens of these magazines circulating around the Cottages. \"No one admitted to liking them,\" she said. \"But you remember how it was. If one turned up in a room, everyone pretended to find it dead boring. Then you came back half an hour later and it would always be gone.\"\\n\\n Anyway, my point is that whenever one of these magazines turned up, people would claim it was a left-over from \"Steve\u0027s collection.\" Steve, in other words, was responsible for every porn mag that ever showed up. As I say, we never found out much else about Steve. We did, though, see the funny side of it even then, so that when someone pointed and said: \"Oh look, one of Steve\u0027s magazines,\" they did it with a bit of irony.\\n\\n These magazines, incidentally, used to drive old Keffers mad. There was a rumour that he was religious and dead against not just porn, but sex in general. Sometimes he\u0027d work himself into a complete state--you could see his face under his grey whiskers blotchy with fury--and he\u0027d go thudding around the place, barging into people\u0027s rooms without knocking, determined to round up every one of \"Steve\u0027s magazines.\" We did our best to find him amusing on these occasions, but there was something truly scary about him in these moods. For one thing, the grumbling he usually kept up suddenly stopped and this silence alone gave him an alarming aura.\\n\\n I remember one particular time when Keffers had collected up six or seven of \"Steve\u0027s mags\" and stormed out with them to his van. Laura and I were watching him from up in my room, and I\u0027d been laughing at something Laura had just said. Then I saw Keffers opening his van door, and maybe because he needed both hands to move some stuff about, he put the mags down on top of some bricks stacked outside the boiler hut--some veterans had tried to build a barbecue there a few months earlier. Keffers\u0027s figure, bent forwards, his head and shoulders hidden in the van, went on rummaging about for ages, and something told me that, for all his fury of a moment ago, he\u0027d now forgotten about the magazines. Sure enough, a few minutes later, I saw him straighten, climb in behind the wheel, slam the door and drive off.\\n\\n When I pointed out to Laura that Keffers had left the magazines behind, she said: \"Well, they won\u0027t stay put for long. He\u0027ll just have to collect them all up again, next time he decides on a purge.\"\\n\\n But when I found myself strolling past the boiler hut about half an hour later, I saw the magazines hadn\u0027t been touched. I thought for a moment about taking them up to my room, but then I could see if they were ever found there, I\u0027d get no end of teasing; and how there was no way people would understand my reasons for doing such a thing. That was why I picked up the magazines and went inside the boiler hut with them.\\n\\n The boiler hut was really just another barn, built onto the end of the farmhouse, filled with old mowers and pitch-forks--stuff Keffers reckoned wouldn\u0027t catch alight too easily if one day the boiler decided to blow up. Keffers also kept a workbench in there, and so I put the magazines down on it, pushed aside some old rags and heaved myself up to sit on the tabletop. The light wasn\u0027t too good, but there was a grimy window somewhere behind me, and when I opened the first magazine I found I could see well enough.\\n\\n There were lots of pictures of girls holding their legs open or sticking their bottoms out. I\u0027ll admit, there have been times when I\u0027ve looked at pictures like that and felt excited, though I\u0027ve never fancied doing it with a girl. But that\u0027s not what I was after that afternoon. I moved through the pages quickly, not wanting to be distracted by any buzz of sex coming off those pages. In fact, I hardly saw the contorted bodies, because I was focusing on the faces. Even in the little adverts for videos or whatever tucked away to the side, I checked each model\u0027s face before moving on.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t until I was nearing the end of the pile that I became certain there was somebody standing outside the barn, just beside the doorway. I\u0027d left the door open because that\u0027s how it was normally, and because I wanted the light; and twice already I\u0027d found myself glancing up, thinking I\u0027d heard some small noise. But there\u0027d been no one there, and I\u0027d just gone on with what I was doing. Now I was certain, though, and lowering my magazine I made a heavy sighing sound that would be clearly audible.\\n\\n I waited for giggling, or maybe for two or three students to come bursting into the barn, eager to make the best of having caught me with a pile of porn mags. But nothing happened. So I called out, in what I tried to make a weary tone: \"Delighted you could join me. Why be so shy?\"\\n\\n There was a little chuckle, then Tommy appeared at the threshold. \"Hi, Kath,\" he said sheepishly.\\n\\n \"Come on in, Tommy. Join in the fun.\"\\n\\n He came towards me cautiously, then stopped a few steps away. Then he looked over to the boiler, and said: \"I didn\u0027t know you liked that sort of stuff.\"\\n\\n \"Girls are allowed too, aren\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n I kept going through the pages, and for the next few seconds he stayed silent. Then I heard him say: \"I wasn\u0027t trying to spy on you. But I saw you from my room. I saw you come out here and pick up that pile Keffers left.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re very welcome to them when I\u0027ve finished.\"\\n\\n He laughed awkwardly. \"It\u0027s just sex stuff. I expect I\u0027ve seen them all already.\" He did another laugh, but then when I glanced up, I saw he was watching me with a serious expression. Then he asked: \"Are you looking for something, Kath?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean? I\u0027m just looking at dirty pictures.\"\\n\\n \"Just for kicks?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose you could say that.\" I put down one mag and started on the next one.\\n\\n Then I heard Tommy\u0027s steps coming nearer until he was right up to me. When I looked up again, his hands were hovering fretfully in the air, like I was doing a complicated manual task and he was itching to help.\\n\\n \"Kath, you don\u0027t... Well, if it\u0027s for kicks, you don\u0027t do it like that. You\u0027ve got to look at the pictures much more carefully. It doesn\u0027t really work if you go that fast.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know what works for girls? Or maybe you\u0027ve looked these over with Ruth. Sorry, not thinking.\"\\n\\n \"Kath, what are you looking for?\"\\n\\n I ignored him. I was nearly at the end of the pile and I was now keen to finish. Then he said: \"I saw you doing this once before.\"\\n\\n This time I did stop and look at him. \"What\u0027s going on here, Tommy? Has Keffers recruited you for his porn patrol?\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t trying to spy on you. But I did see you, that time last week, after we\u0027d all been up in Charley\u0027s room. There was one of these mags there, and you thought we\u0027d all left and gone. But I came back to get my jumper, and Claire\u0027s doors were open so I could see straight through to Charley\u0027s room. That\u0027s how I saw you in there, going through the magazine.\"\\n\\n \"Well, so what? We all have to get our kicks some way.\"\\n\\n \"You weren\u0027t doing it for kicks. I could tell, just like I can now. It\u0027s your face, Kath. That time in Charley\u0027s room, you had a strange face. Like you were sad, maybe. And a bit scared.\"\\n\\n I jumped off the workbench, gathered up the mags and dumped them in his arms. \"Here. Give these to Ruth. See if they do anything for her.\"\\n\\n I walked past him and out of the barn. I knew he\u0027d be disappointed I hadn\u0027t told him anything, but at that point I hadn\u0027t thought things through properly myself and wasn\u0027t ready to tell anyone. But I hadn\u0027t minded him coming into the boiler hut after me. I hadn\u0027t minded at all. I\u0027d felt comforted, protected almost. I did tell him eventually, but that wasn\u0027t until a few months later, when we went on our Norfolk trip.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372/913.html","bookId":311,"book":{"id":311,"title":"别让我走 Never let me go","description":"简介： 一段令人心碎、惴惴不安的爱情故事，勾勒出一幅阐明人性的脆弱与希望、寻找乡关何处的宿命风景，而在平凡寻常文字间，呈现惊人真相的悬疑推理画面 海尔森表面上看来是一所迷人...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110906/1-110Z6102914c2.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/372","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
