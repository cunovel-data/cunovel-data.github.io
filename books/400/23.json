{"id":33029,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXII","content":"1 Even average people, when obsessed by the grand passion--which is a far rarer passion among Anglo-Saxons than Anglo-Saxon novelists would have us believe--cannot be judged by average standards. Such are as surely bound to the wheels of terror as to the wheels of courage. In such, strength and weakness, misery and ecstasy, love\u0027s heaven and love\u0027s hell, mingle as wax and honey in the comb. For the grand passion is the sublime exaggerator of human emotion, the indefinable complex of the soul. So, to Aliette, returning from her interview with Julia, it seemed as though London\u0027s self had altered its countenance, as though every face encountered on her homeward way spoke of her own newly-regained happiness. Her momentary change of feeling toward Ronnie had been trivial; an undercurrent of misunderstanding rather than an overt quarrel. Yet the relief of knowing it over was tremendous. She found him huddled in the armchair before the gas-fire; Ponto, surreptitiously introduced into Powolney Mansions, couched at his feet. He rose as she entered; and the great dog, wagging a delighted stern, rose with him. In a flash of new insight, she saw how alike they were: the big man and the big dog--devoted both, both asking only kindness. And whimsically she thought: \"I\u0027ve been unkind to both of them. I ought to have gone to see Ponto when he was ill. I ought never to have let myself drift away, even in thought, from Ronnie.\" As always, Ponto nuzzled his great head against her knee; Ronnie, as always, kissed her. But that night, as never since Chilworth nights, Aliette answered Ronnie\u0027s kisses, giving him all her confidence, all her tenderness. \"No more quarrels, man. No more secrets,\" she whispered drowsily, falling to sleep in his arms. \"Quarrels, darling?\" he whispered back. \"We couldn\u0027t really quarrel--you and I.\" And after that, for many a day, their rose-bubble of enchantment--the frail yet impermeable magic of the grand passion--reblew itself about those twain, isolating them from their fellows, making even Powolney Mansions a paradise. For many a day neither spiritual nor material troubles clouded the bright mirror of their joint happiness. Scarcely conscious of the discomforts in which they lived; utterly unconscious of the nascent hostility--a hostility based on some rumor which had arisen none knew whence and was tending none knew whither--among their fellow-boarders; careless alike of financial difficulties, of outlawry, and of ostracism, they went their way among their uncaring kind. The high courts were closed; and so far, despite the promises of John Cartwright, neither county nor police courts afforded Ronnie a single brief. Wherefore he and Aliette made holiday together, with London for their playground. Wandering, Ponto at heel, her streets and her parks, her squares and her terraces, they knew the keen radium of London\u0027s morning, her smoke-gray half-lights, the red-gold radiance of her dimmed sunsets, the first out-twinkle of her street-lamps, faintly green against a faintly violet sky, her high evening arcs, and the long lit saffron parallels of her mysterious nights. And one day, wandering casually beside London\u0027s river, wandering, to be exact, through Fulham and over Putney Bridge, they knew that, by sheerest accident, they had found them a home. To a Lady Hermione or a Lady Cynthia, Embankment House, a great red building-block which overlooks the Thames, would have been the last word in discomfort. Except for the automatic lift (into which Ronnie, Aliette, Ponto, and the uniformed porter who showed them over, squeezed only as asparagus into a tin), and the gas-cooker left in the tiny top-floor kitchen by an absconding tenant, no luxuries whatsoever ameliorated the bareness of Flat 27, Block B. It was, in fact, hardly more than the model working-man\u0027s tenement of its original builder\u0027s dream. But since it possessed five tolerable rooms, the possibility of installing a geyser bath, and, above all things, its own front door, they decided instantaneously on its acquirement, seeking out the secretary of the house and paying the requisite deposit of a quarter\u0027s rent that very afternoon. So excited were both at the prospect of domestic privacy, so engrossed with their plans for expending Julia\u0027s Christmas present to best advantage, that two incidents which--at any other time--would have been of immense importance, passed almost unnoticed. The first of these incidents was Rear-Admiral Billy\u0027s written confession of failure, and the second--\"the scandal of Powolney Mansions.\" For the rumor which had arisen none knew whence, the rumor that \"Mrs. Cavendish wasn\u0027t really Mrs. Cavendish at all, but the wife of a well-known society man who refused to divorce her,\" at last blew so strongly that Monsieur (who before the war would have called himself Herr) Mayer, proprietor of the Mansions, felt himself finally obliged to take notice of it. \"Of course, I ask you no questions, Mr. Cavendish,\" said Monsieur Mayer, seated undistinguished at the dusty desk in his private office. \"Of course I ask you and your wife no questions. Your private affairs are your private affairs. But in a boarding-house it is not always possible to keep one\u0027s private affairs private; and there has been talk, much talk. That Miss Greenwell, she who have No. 26, and pay less than any one in the house, she gossip all the time. She gossip about you and Mrs. Cavendish. For my part,\" he waved a deprecatory hand, \"I know it is only gossip. I make no suggestion. To me, so long as you pay your bill at the end of the week, it is all right.\" To which Ronnie, in his most cautious legal manner, retorted: \"If Miss Greenwell or any of your other guests wish to make imputations against myself or my wife, I shall be glad if they will make them to me personally\"--and promptly gave a fortnight\u0027s notice. \"Dash the fellow\u0027s impertinence.\" he laughed to Aliette, when he reported the interview. \"There\u0027s no law in England to stop you from calling yourself Mrs. Cavendish.\" But Aliette, looking up from the wall-paper pattern-book she was studying, did not laugh; because intuitively she knew the power behind Miss Greenwell\u0027s throne. \"Hector\u0027s doing,\" she thought. \"Somehow or other he must have put the tale about.\" And in that moment, for the first time, she began to despise her legal owner. There was neither fear nor hate in her despising; only disdain and a crystallization of courage. That Hector should try to hurt her man financially seemed unsporting enough; but this latest secret effort to drive them shelterless into the streets of London put him, in her eyes, definitely beyond the pale. All the same, for the last fortnight of their stay, \"Mr. and Mrs. Cavendish\" more than ever eschewed the public apartments and \"congenial society\" of Powolney Mansions. 2 Meanwhile, for the only character in our story who was not directly concerned with the feud of the Bruntons and the Cavendishes--to wit, Betty Masterman--the average metropolitan life went on. Betty Masterman, however, treating her self-invited guest with that lavish hospitality which provides bed and board without asking even companionship in exchange, lunching out, dining out, dancing and theatering, visiting and being visited by a horde of acquaintances, knew a good deal more about the progress of the feud than she confided to Mollie, and vastly more than Mollie confided to her. Betty knew, for instance, that Hector Brunton, had it not been for the now full-blown scandal of his wife\u0027s desertion, would have been offered his knighthood; that Julia Cavendish, for the identical reason, had not been made a dame of the British Empire; that Dot Fancourt who, it was rumored, had been captured in betrothal by a middle-aged spinster of markedly reactionary views, never tired of lamenting \"dear Julia\u0027s mistaken devotion to her son\"; and that Sir Peter Wilberforce, whose baronetcy had been duly announced in the New Year\u0027s honors, was more than anxious that his son should get married. To the grass-widow, it must be confessed, the feud itself seemed as petty as its ramifications ludicrous. Her own affair--the affair of the known husband who wrote every month from Toowoomba, Queensland, and the unknown lover who wrote almost every day from Queen\u0027s Gate, London--had always been one of those semi-public secrets which leave no speck upon the escutcheon. Aliette\u0027s method, therefor, appeared in her estimation foolish--though not quite so unnecessarily foolish as the scruples which prevented Mollie Fullerford from accepting the obvious heart and equally obvious hand of her Jimmy. \"Sorry, dear,\" Betty used to say, \"but I can\u0027t see it. Either you\u0027re in love with the man or you\u0027re not. If you are in love with him, why on earth don\u0027t you marry him? He\u0027s got plenty of money; you\u0027ve got a little money; and until you\u0027re tired of one another it ought to be ideal.\" \"You needn\u0027t be so beastly cynical,\" Mollie, ignorant of Queen\u0027s Gate, used to protest. \"Just because your own marriage wasn\u0027t a success, there\u0027s no reason why mine shouldn\u0027t be. But I\u0027m not going to marry Jimmy until he\u0027s arranged things between Alie and her husband.\" \"Suppose he can\u0027t arrange them, my dear?\" \"Of course he can arrange them if he really wants to. He\u0027s a lawyer.\" \"You absolutely refuse to marry him until he does?\" \"Absolutely.\" Despite which repeated assurance, Mollie Fullerford knew that her decision weakened daily. It was all very well to pretend to Jimmy when he called, as he constantly did call, that there could be no hope for him until her wishes had been carried out; all very well, for the moment, to be reluctant in hand-clasps, grudging with kisses. But \"that sort of thing\" couldn\u0027t go on. It wasn\u0027t--Aliette\u0027s phrase--\"dignified.\" And besides--she felt herself growing far too fond of Jimmy for half-love. She wanted Jimmy; wanted him very badly; wanted him worse than she had ever wanted anything in her life. In point of fact--it had come to that now--she couldn\u0027t \"jolly well live without Jimmy\"; and would undoubtedly have yielded to Jimmy\u0027s persistence before the spring, had it not been for Eva Martin\u0027s interference. That resolute lady of the cold blue eyes, the fading gold hair, and the hard unpleasant hands came to London early in January with the avowed intention of \"putting matters straight once and for all.\" With Aliette, invited to luncheon at the Ladies\u0027 Army and Navy Club (irreverently known as \"Arms and Necks\" to junior subalterns), she failed completely, Ronnie\u0027s \"wife\" refusing, tight-lipped, even to discuss the situation. But with Mollie the sisterly machinations attained, in some slight degree, their trouble-making objective. \"You see, my dear,\" said the colonel\u0027s lady, \"you\u0027re such a child that one really oughtn\u0027t to take you into one\u0027s confidence at all. But unfortunately this sort of thing can\u0027t be glossed over. In a way, I need hardly tell you, I\u0027m very sorry for poor Alie. When I compare my own Harold with her Hector, I realize Hector\u0027s inferiority. All the same,\"--this last with both elbows firmly on the tea-table--\"the only course to be pursued, believe me, is for Aliette to return to her husband.\" \"But that would be perfectly beastly,\" retorted Mollie, the mild antagonism she had always felt for Eva turning to intensest dislike. \"Beastly or not,\" decided the colonel\u0027s lady, with some asperity, \"it\u0027s the only thing to be done.\" And she added, with that bitter-sweetness which made Colonel Harold Martin look back upon the western front during the great war as the only peaceful place he had ever known: \"Let me remind you, dear child, that there isn\u0027t only Alie to be considered. There are your own chances. You\u0027ll want to be getting married one of these days, and naturally, no man in a good position----\" The sentence trailed off into a silence as suggestive as the atmosphere Eva left behind her when she trailed out of Betty Masterman\u0027s flat; so strengthening the girl\u0027s weakened decision that Jimmy Wilberforce, who dropped in half an hour later to plead his own and his baronet father\u0027s cause, found himself confronted with a white face, a pair of haggard eyes, and the tense ultimatum, \"Jimmy, I\u0027ll marry you the day Hector sets Alie free, but not a day before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316/90616.html","bookId":400,"book":{"id":400,"title":"The Love Story of Aliette Brunton","description":"简介： In our heart of hearts--which we in England take almost as much pains to hide from ourselves as from our fellow-creatures--most of us realize that life without love is a weariness, a conflict bereft of hope, a struggle for no victory....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM"}}
