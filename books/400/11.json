{"id":33017,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X","content":"1 The \"grand passion\" (it is unfortunate that no single word in the English language exactly pictures that emotional process) was a little beyond Caroline Staley\u0027s philosophy. Yet within twelve hours of Aliette\u0027s interview with Hector, even Caroline Staley realized that \"Miss Aliette was about through with that husband of hers.\" Lennard and the rest of the staff--though Caroline refused to gossip--were also aware, basement-wise, of the connubial position. In fact, at Lancaster Gate, only Mollie remained in ignorance. For, at the moment, Mollie Fullerford was far too absorbed to bother herself overlong about either sister or brother-in-law; a sublime selfishness held her aloof from both. The girl\u0027s mind was concentrated on Jimmy. It had become a point of honor with her not to think of anybody except Jimmy. Jimmy--for his own sake--must be neither \"fascinated\" nor \"put off.\" He must be given his exact measure of attraction as of repulsion, his exact chance of finding out her faults as well as her virtues. Then, when he had definitely fallen in or out of love with the real her--she would decide exactly how much she could love the real him. \"Marriage,\" the girl said to herself, \"is a pretty serious business. Jimmy and I mustn\u0027t make any mistake about it.\" Mollie Fullerford, you see, was of the modern young, who are trying, vainly, to avoid the troubles of their romantic and unreasoning elders--such troubles, for instance, as Hector\u0027s. Hector, reticent always, confided his troubles to nobody. He spent the first twelve hours after the quarrel in kicking himself for a fool and a savage who had nearly thrashed his wife; the next twelve in cursing himself for a fool and a softy who ought to have thrashed his wife--and the rest of the week fighting against the impulse to apologize. Meanwhile he was a stranger in his own house; excluded, as surely as though he had been a servant under notice, from domestic conversation. His wife had taken to breakfasting in bed (the rattle of the tray infuriated him every morning), and refused to get up till he had left the house: he, retorting in the only way open to him, dined at his clubs. On the one occasion when they did meet, her manners were beyond criticism--and her unattainable beauty a positive bar to any plans for sex-consolation. As a matter of psychological fact, both husband and wife were in a momentary state of complete sex-revulsion. Hector, thwarted of his one desire, seeing Aliette unobtainable as the only woman in the world; and Aliette--love\u0027s dream obscured by thought of love\u0027s material consequences--regarding herself, for the nonce, as the mere quarry of two males, a quarry anxious only to escape both pursuers. Twice, at least, Aliette\u0027s thoughts renounced womanhood completely. The physical Hector, the Hector of the writhing lips, she hated; but when her yearning for the physical Ronnie grew so desperately acute that she had to rush out of the library lest she should telephone to him; when every post which brought no letter seemed the last bodily hurt she could endure: then, looking back on her lost virginity of temperament, she could be amazingly sorry for, amazingly grateful to the abstemious Hector of the last three years. Yet all the time, she knew subconsciously that she loved Ronnie; that, without him, life was one mazed loneliness. Aliette, like Hector, kept her own counsel. Mary O\u0027Riordan, to whom--as in duty bound--she confided a hint of her distress, pumped her for full confession, but pumped in vain. Only Ponto, the huge harlequin Dane with the magpie coat and the princely manners, shared her mazed loneliness. She used to fetch the dog, every after-lunch-time, from the garage in Westbourne Street where he had his abode; and wander with him by the hour together through Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Ponto, unlike her other pursuers, desired nothing but an occasional caress. He would pad and pad after her, close to heel, disdainful of all distractions, his eyes on the hem of her skirt, his stern slapping only the mildest disapproval of an occasional fly. And when she sat her down to meditate, the beast--as though conscious of the fret in his mistress--would content affection with the rare up-thrust of an enormous consolatory paw. Vaguely during that week Ponto\u0027s mistress conceived the scheme of sending to Moor Park for Miracle, of condescending to ride in the Row. Dumb animals, of a sudden, seemed so much wiser, so much kinder than men. But to ride in the Row would make one conspicuous, and instinct warned her that the less conspicuous she made herself during the season, the easier things might be--in the event of a social crash. 2 One other woman in London--during the days which followed Aliette\u0027s definite break with Hector--was meditating the probabilities of a social crash. \"Julia,\" said Dot Fancourt, dropping in to lunch on Friday, \"you\u0027re not looking so well. You ought to see Baynet again. You\u0027ve nothing on your mind, have you?\" \"My dear Dot,\" retorted the novelist, smiling, \"I\u0027m quite well, and I have nothing on what you are pleased to call my mind--except the vulgarity of your methods in booming my divorce article.\" But after Dot had gone back to his office, Julia Cavendish\u0027s face lost its smile. Surveyed in cool retrospect, her momentary thought-panic in Hyde Park appeared a mere firework of the literary imagination. Nevertheless, ever since Sunday, when she had tried, over dinner, to let him inkle her knowledge, to warn him, she had been reproaching herself about Ronnie. Other mothers--her own sister Clementina among them--did not apparently find it at all difficult to discuss sex matters with their sons. Yet she, the celebrated psychologist, had found it impossible. \"If only I could have been open with him,\" she thought, \"if only I could have said: \u0027I\u0027m afraid that you\u0027ve fallen in love with that charming Mrs. Brunton. You won\u0027t let it go too far--will you? Women\u0027s heads are so easily turned.\u0027\" She would not, of course, have said more than that. Ronnie was so sensible, so straight and clean, that he would have needed no further warning. Ronnie--her Ronnie--did not in the least resemble the heroes of her novels, the passionate men with cleft chins who occasionally counted the world well lost for love. Ronnie was the very spit of his father, the Oxford don. Still even dons were human. And Ronnie, unwarned, might have lost his head. As for the woman--women, according to Julia Cavendish, could always fall prey to the sentimental impulse. If only a man were sufficiently ardent the entire sex yielded to him. Why should this Mrs. Brunton be the exception? Ronnie--her Ronnie--must be terribly attractive. Therefore---- And quite suddenly, Julia panicked again. Her literary imagination saw the worst; Aliette in Ronnie\u0027s arms, Ronnie in the divorce court. Her heart went cold at the imaginary prospect. The mother, the religious woman, and the Victorian in her were alike appalled. Jealousy spread a yellow jaundice film over her intellect. Seen through that film, the \"charming Mrs. Brunton\" became a harpy, an over-dressed, over-scented, over-manicured harpy, her unguented claws sharp for an innocent boy. Whereupon Julia Cavendish--turning, as most literary people in a crisis, to her pen--began the composition of a letter which should convey, tactfully, of course, the picture of the harpy to the mind of the boy. But the letter, completed, read so much more like a piece of fiction than a statement of fact, that she tore it up; and contented herself with the usual note ordering him to dinner on Saturday. 3 The note itself contained nothing to alarm Ronnie; and yet, dressing to obey its commands in his severe mannish bedroom, he felt nervous about the coming interview. For five days now he had been on edge; sleepless, unable to concentrate thought. Every night he had expected that Aliette would telephone; every morning, every evening, he had expected a letter from her. It never dawned on his mind that she should be equally on edge, equally expectant. Since she had admitted her love, asking only that he should not hurry her, chivalry forbade the obvious course which his impatient manhood dictated--attack. Chivalry, too, urged him not to make any final move before weighing the uttermost consequences. For himself, he had already weighed them; and they weighed light enough. But for her, even though a man and a woman decided their love justified before God and the law, remained always their justification before their fellow-creatures. Under any circumstances, the consequences would include a divorce. And even the farcical divorce of the period carried--for a woman in Aliette\u0027s position--its stigma. Ronnie remembered the Carrington case. Suppose Brunton cut up rough; perjured himself in court as Carrington had done--purely for spite. In an undefended divorce case, the man and woman cited could not defend themselves against a perjurer without risking their freedom. And then, then--there was Julia to consider. The mind of the clean-shaven man who let himself out of the dark-green door of 127b Jermyn Street, and strode rapidly across Piccadilly, may be compared to the hair-trigger of a cocked pistol. 4 \"Your mother is already in the dining-room, Mr. Ronald,\" said the uniformed parlormaid, who had valeted him while he was still at Winchester. \"Thank you, Kate.\" Ronnie handed the woman his hat and strode in. Julia stood by the be-ferned fireplace, inspecting a newly-acquired print, only that afternoon hung. Kissing him, she called his attention to the treasure. \"It\u0027s \u0027The Match-Seller\u0027--a proof before letters. Only two more to find, and my collection of \u0027The Cries of London\u0027 will be complete.\" They talked prints, engravings and china throughout dinner. Julia, acting on Sir Heron Baynet\u0027s advice, ate sparingly, and drank nothing stronger than Evian water; but for her son she had ordered a miniature feast--all the particular foods of his particular boyhood--and the last bottle of his father\u0027s Chambertin. Usually, when she prepared such a feast, Ronnie would compliment her on her memory, her forethought; but to-night he seemed scarcely aware of what he ate. She had to coax him: \"Turbot, dear, your favorite fish,\" or, \"I remembered the sauce Béarnaise, you see.\" Coaxed, he complimented her; but without enthusiasm--so that, hurt, she said to herself: \"He\u0027s giving me only half his mind. He\u0027s thinking of that woman. I\u0027m certain he\u0027d rather be dining her at Claridge\u0027s\"--(Julia\u0027s heroes often \"dined\" their discreetly illicit passions at the more expensive caravanserais)--\"than sitting here with his old mother.\" Meanwhile he said to himself, \"She\u0027s taken so much trouble over this little dinner. I ought to be more grateful. Dash it, I am grateful! Good Lord, it\u0027s nearly nine o\u0027clock! The last post will be in soon. Perhaps there\u0027ll be a letter. Perhaps Aliette will telephone to-night. I must get away by ten.\" Resultantly, by the time Kate brought coffee and cigarettes, the moment for confidences was as unpropitious as any Julia Cavendish could possibly have chosen. \"Ronnie,\" she, began, as soon as they were alone, \"I hope you won\u0027t be angry at what I\u0027m going to say.\" The opening, so entirely foreign to her usual abruptness, made Ronnie--on the instant--suspicious. The Wixton imagination in him said: \"Danger! She\u0027s found out. She knows something about Aliette. She may know about Aliette\u0027s having been to your rooms.\" And immediately the magisterial Cavendish in him decided: \"I shall refuse to be drawn. It\u0027s not her business. Even if she does know, she ought to have waited till I thought fit to broach the subject.\" Nevertheless, the ghost of the schoolboy who had liked sauce Béarnaise and been vaguely frightened of his mother was in a funk. The ghost of the schoolboy, looking at his mother\u0027s determined chin, did not see the unhappiness behind his mother\u0027s blue eyes. After a second\u0027s hesitation, the magisterial Cavendish laughed. \"It depends on what you are going to say, mater.\" \"It isn\u0027t much.\" Julia braced herself to the unpleasant task. \"Perhaps it isn\u0027t anything at all. But I feel that you\u0027re keeping something from me. Something rather--important. Something that\u0027s making you unhappy. Can\u0027t you confide in me? I might be able to help. We\u0027ve never had any secrets from each other, you and I.\" Kate, coming in to clear the table, was shooed away with a calm \"We haven\u0027t quite finished our coffee. I\u0027ll ring when I want you.\" \"We oughtn\u0027t to have secrets from one another,\" went on Julia diffidently. Her son, stiff-lipped, uncompromising, made no answer; and she continued, a little afraid: \"You told me about Lucy. Can\u0027t you tell me about this--love affair?\" The tone irritated him. \"My dear mater, what love affair?\" \"Flirtation, then?\" Fleetingly, her suspicions lulled by his presence, she thought how ridiculous it was of him to be so stubborn. Dot Fancourt, Paul Flower, and many other of the literary among her acquaintances rather liked talking about their flirtations. Then his very stubbornness perturbed her. \"Ronnie,\" she said, \"be open with me. You are in love?\" \"What if I am?\" He had never lied to her, and had no intention of doing so now. Apparently she did not know about Aliette\u0027s having been to Jermyn Street; otherwise--reticence with him not being one of her characteristics--she would have said so. Obviously, though, she suspected quite enough! \"What if I am?\" he repeated. \"You mean--it\u0027s not my business?\" she faltered. \"Yes. I do mean that. I don\u0027t want to be unkind, or unfair. But you must see that I can\u0027t discuss--that sort of thing with you.\" \"Why not?\" Thoroughly alarmed now, she tried to hide alarm with a smile. \"Lots of people do confide in me. I--you know I wouldn\u0027t betray your confidence.\" \"Is that quite the point?\" Julia Cavendish deigned to plead: \"I\u0027ve been so worried, Ronnie. I feel, somehow, that you\u0027re in trouble. I feel I understand why. And I only want you to let me help you.\" His mood softened. \"Poor old mater,\" he thought. But her next words dispelled softness; irritated him again. \"You see,\" she said, \"you\u0027re still so young. Only a boy really. You don\u0027t know the world as I know it. You mustn\u0027t reject my advice.\" \"I\u0027m thirty-six,\" he parried. \"And I\u0027m over sixty.\" \"You don\u0027t look it, mater.\" She felt herself being edged away from her topic. She saw a vision of Aliette Brunton--standing palpably between herself and her son. Vague jealousy clouded her love, her kindness. \"You don\u0027t deny the correctness of my statement,\" she shot at him. \"You admit that you are in love?\" \"Suppose I admit that much----\" His lean face flushed. \"Then the least you can do is to tell me with whom. You say you don\u0027t want to be unkind or unfair. Is it fair, or kind, to let me\"--Julia hesitated over the word--\"suspect things?\" He said bluntly, \"There is nothing to suspect.\" She said with equal bluntness, \"Then why am I not to be told?\" Ronnie\u0027s temper rose. He, too, saw a vision of Aliette, palpably demanding his protection. \"Because there\u0027s nothing to tell.\" \"Ronnie, that\u0027s not the truth.\" The words burst from her. \"You\u0027ve never lied to me before. Why can\u0027t you tell me the truth now? Ever since Sunday, I\u0027ve known----\" \"Known what?\" Her heart dropped a beat at his obvious anger. It was as though she already knew the worst. Love and jealousy, strangely commingling in her ego, ousted--for one flash of a second--all other emotions. So that it might have been an adoring wife rather than a religious mother who answered. \"That you and Mrs. Brunton were in love with each other.\" \"So she knew all the time,\" thought Ronnie. His first feeling was relief. At least the mater knew nothing of what had happened since Sunday. Only her uncanny intuition had led her to the truth. Then fear--no longer fear for himself, but fear for Aliette--keyed his legal brain to defense. \"You have no right to make that statement. Where\u0027s your proof, your evidence?\" She looked him full in the face; noted the blood at his temples, the working nostrils, the angry sparks in his light blue eyes. The effort to stand up against his obstinacy wrenched her in pieces. Her knees, her very stomach trembled. The known room, the beloved things, seemed suddenly worthless. She felt self-reproachfully that she had loved things too much, her son too little. She could have cried, then and there--she who had never let the tears to her eyes. \"Ronnie,\" she pleaded, \"why must you be so hard, so hostile? Mothers don\u0027t need \u0027evidence.\u0027 At least, I don\u0027t. Not where you are concerned. You said just now that this--this affair was none of my business. Isn\u0027t it a mother\u0027s business to protect her child, to save him? Would it have been fair for me not to have spoken? It isn\u0027t as if you couldn\u0027t trust me----\" She broke off; and fear faded from the mind of her son. He was no longer even angry. Once again he saw in Julia the \"lonely old woman,\" dependent solely on his affection; saw her--very radiant down the years--fetching him, still a child, from his \"Dame\u0027s School\" in Welbeck Street; saw her visiting him at Winchester, at the Varsity. Always, she had been the confidante, the rather stern confidante, of his troubles. Surely, surely when she knew the fineness of Aliette, when she knew how Aliette had refused to let him hurt her, she would help him, help both of them? \"Of course I trust you. It isn\u0027t that. And if--if we\u0027d decided anything definitely, I\u0027d tell you about it. But, as things are, I can\u0027t tell you anything. You see that, don\u0027t you?\" \"No. I don\u0027t,\" said Julia sternly--the mother, the religious woman and the traditionalist in her alike roused to bay by the sudden frankness. \"It seems to me that, having admitted so much, you owe me the rest.\" \"But it wouldn\u0027t be fair----\" \"I can\u0027t see why. Unless--unless there\u0027s something you--you\u0027re both afraid of my knowing.\" \"Mater!\" All the chivalry in him, revolting at the slur on Aliette, urged full confession. \"You\u0027ve spoken with her. You can\u0027t possibly imagine that she\u0027s the sort of woman who----\" Indignation dumbed him; and in his moment of dumbness the mother realized her mistake, realized him in that hair-trigger state of emotion when the slightest touch will loose the explosion; realized that he and Aliette were on the verge of disaster, that Aliette was the wife of a king\u0027s counselor, that she, Julia, must cut out her tongue rather than say the word which would decide her son to wreck his career. But realization came too late. \"You don\u0027t imagine that she--that we would do anything underhand,\" burst out the boy in Ronnie. \"Of course not, dear.\" Almost Julia had it in her to hate the woman\u0027s virtue. To love in secret was certainly a sin before God; but to commit open adultery was a sin before both God and what remained of English Society. \"And, mater,\" he bent forward boyishly, across the table, \"I love her; we love each other.\" \"Another man\u0027s wife?\" \"Only in name.\" His teeth clenched. \"Only in law.\" She wanted to say, \"You believe that?\"; but instinct restrained her. She grew frightened at the passion in Ronnie\u0027s eyes. He talked on--vehemently. \"I can\u0027t live without her. I won\u0027t. Why should I? What\u0027s a divorce nowadays? Who cares? Except a few snuffy old priests. And half of them don\u0027t know their own minds.\" \"Ronnie!\" She conjured up every atom of force in her to wrestle with his vehemence. \"What\u0027s happened to you? divorce means scandal. It means sin. But I won\u0027t talk about the religious part. One either believes or one doesn\u0027t. I only beg of you, I implore you, to think of your career----\" \"Who cares about my career----\" \"I do.\" \"My career won\u0027t suffer----\" \"It will. You\u0027ll be disbarred. Brunton\u0027s a power. You\u0027ll have him for enemy instead of for friend. You\u0027ll make a thousand enemies. The snuffy old priests, as you call them, aren\u0027t the only ones who care about divorce. Half the houses I visit will be closed to you.\" \"For six months.\" \"No. For good. And you\u0027ll never be able to go into politics.\" \"Politics!\" scornfully. \"People will cut you.\" \"Let them.\" Opposition, clarifying his mind, keyed him to fight. \"Let them! What do I care? We sha\u0027n\u0027t have done anything wrong.\" \"It\u0027s always wrong to set ourselves up against the world.\" \"That\u0027s sheer cowardice. And it isn\u0027t true, either. What about Jesus Christ?\" \"That\u0027s sheer blasphemy.\" One of the dinner-table candles guttered and went out. To Julia, it seemed like an omen. She saw her son\u0027s career gutter out in that curling smoke; saw him entrapped by the powers of darkness, prey to the personal devil. Now no one except God, her own particular secular god, could help. She prayed voicelessly to that particular secular god for words to save the entrapped soul of her boy. \"Ronnie! You\u0027ve always been so good, the best of sons. You\u0027ve never given me a moment\u0027s anxiety--never--since the day you were born. Until now! And you\u0027ve always trusted me. Won\u0027t you trust me in this? Won\u0027t you believe me when I tell you that the thing you contemplate is a sin?\" Quietly, he answered, \"If God is love, how can love be a sin?\" The phrase shot a tiny sliver of doubt through the armor of Julia Cavendish\u0027s belief, pricking her unwisdom to retort: \"Love! Love isn\u0027t passion. Love is service. If you loved her, really and truly loved her, you\u0027d save this woman from herself. And if she loved you, really and truly loved you, she\u0027d be the last person in the world----\" He wanted to argue: \"You don\u0027t understand. You\u0027re too prejudiced to understand.\" Instead, comprehending abruptly how far his confidences had outrun actuality, he blustered: \"We won\u0027t discuss her motives, please. Or mine. Neither of us is a child--as you seem to think. We\u0027re quite capable of deciding things for ourselves. When we do----\" \"She hasn\u0027t consented then?\" Julia grasped at the life-buoy. \"No.\" Another doubt entered like a dart into the mother\u0027s mind. Suppose Sir Heron\u0027s warnings came true? Then soon there might be nobody to care for Ronnie. Suppose, suppose this woman really did care--as she, Julia, cared? A woman in Mrs. Brunton\u0027s position would hardly risk divorce for a béguin. Nervously she played with her favorite ring--a diamond-set miniature of her son in earliest boyhood. Nervously she said: \"You won\u0027t do things in a hurry. Promise me that.\" \"I can\u0027t promise anything,\" He blustered again, feeling that she was trying to fetter his independence. \"I\u0027d rather not discuss the subject any more.\" The bluster, so foreign to him, irritated her dignity. \"Very well. It shall be as you wish. We\u0027ll say no more about this matter. It\u0027s been very painful to me, and I can only hope it won\u0027t be still more painful--to both of us--before it\u0027s over.\" His irritated dignity answered hers. \"Why to both of us? It\u0027s entirely my affair.\" \"Not entirely. I\u0027ve tried to keep myself out of this question; but, as your mother, I have certain claims. And you know, or at least you ought to know, my feelings on the subject of divorce. I ask you to believe that I\u0027m trying to sympathize with you, to see your point of view. But I can\u0027t. To me, any union, however legalized, between you and Hector Brunton\u0027s wife, means deadly sin. You call this passion of yours love. I don\u0027t. I call it by an uglier name.\" His eyes kindled. \"That angers you. I\u0027m sorry. But I\u0027m speaking the truth, as I see it. If you and she decide to commit this deadly sin, don\u0027t come to me for forgiveness.\" Julia rose, weary with words, to her feet. \"Shall we go upstairs to the drawing-room? Kate will be waiting to clear the table.\" \"Not for a moment.\" Ronnie, too, rose. \"What do you mean, exactly, when you say, \u0027Don\u0027t come to me for forgiveness\u0027?\" \"What do I mean?\" Sheer physical fatigue unnerved Julia\u0027s mind. Jealousy, the mad mother jealousy for the mate which her brain had been holding in leash all evening, broke its bonds; so that she saw her only son, the baby she had cherished from his cradle, lost to her in another woman\u0027s arms. White arms--young and smooth and sinful! \"What do I mean? Only this--that you must choose between your mother and your--mistress.\" Even as that last word escaped the barrier of her teeth, Julia Cavendish knew the mistake irretrievable. Her dignity flickered out like a match in a storm. She wanted to throw herself on his mercy, to beg his pardon with bended knees. But the word, the unpardonable insult of a word, was out. Slowly, she saw his mind grip its full significance. Then his face paled to harsh granite; and his eyes, for once in their lives, grew sterner than her own. \"I have chosen,\" said Ronald Cavendish. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316/90604.html","bookId":400,"book":{"id":400,"title":"The Love Story of Aliette Brunton","description":"简介： In our heart of hearts--which we in England take almost as much pains to hide from ourselves as from our fellow-creatures--most of us realize that life without love is a weariness, a conflict bereft of hope, a struggle for no victory....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM"}}
