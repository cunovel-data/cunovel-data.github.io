{"id":33011,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER IV","content":"1 Julia Cavendish was always at home on Saturday afternoons. You used to meet nearly all social sorts and conditions of men and women in that exquisitely tended Bruton Street house: literary folk, financial folk, embassy folk, Anglican priests, politicians, schoolmasters with their wives, young soldiers with their fiancées, old soldiers with their grievances, the \"Ritz crowd\" (which thinks itself Society), and real Society (which does not need to think about itself at all), intellectual aristocrats and democratic intellectuals--the whole curious \"London\" which an eclectic woman of means can, if she be so minded, gather about herself by the time she reaches sixty. But the house itself betrayed, to a trained observer, the fact that Ronnie\u0027s mother really preferred things to people. Not necessarily expensive things--only occasionally could she afford a real \"piece\": but pleasant things; beautiful things that became, as it were, part of one\u0027s life; things one could feel about the house as though they were people, but people without too many claims on one. Despite which, No. 67a was neither over-large nor over-crowded with possessions. Old prints had space on its panels, old furniture on its floors. Jade idols, Toby mugs, Dresden, Chelsea, and Japanese figures did not jostle one another on its mantelpieces or in its cabinets. Spanish velvets and Venetian brocades forbore to pose as \"specimens,\" but were curtains, cushions, or chair-covers as use demanded. Georgian silver employed itself in a hospitable capacity; Satsuma vases held flowers; Bokhara rugs covered the parquet, not the walls. \"I\u0027m a practical old woman,\" said Julia; and she looked it now, as she lay reading on the sofa in the square bow-windowed drawing-room. A rather stern face was Julia Cavendish\u0027s: the Wixton chin dimpled but very determined; the eyes, under their tortoise-shell spectacles, bluer, harder than the eyes of her son. The wrinkles in the scarcely powdered cheeks and at the high temples, as well as the graying of the light brown hair, not all her own, betrayed her age. But the hands which held the novel still appeared the hands of a young woman; nor had the years robbed her of her figure. Her dress--a black tea-gown, real lace at bosom and wrist--was so unfashionable as to be almost smart. Black silk stockings and black satin shoes--she had elegant feet--complete the picture. A bell rang below. Julia laid her novel on a little lacquered stand by the sofa; took off her spectacles; and sat up to the maid\u0027s announcement of \"Mr. Fancourt.\" Dot Fancourt, a sentimental, unhappy old man with over-red cheeks, sunken eyes and beetling gray brows, his weak mouth hidden by a walrus mustache, extended both dry hands in effusive salutation. \"My dear, how are you?\" \"In the best of health, as usual.\" Julia Cavendish released her fingers from the dry hands. \"Tell me what Fleet Street thinks about the Ellerson case.\" The editor of \"The Contemplatory Magazine\" began to gossip; and she listened to him. The pair had been friends for thirty years, the man\u0027s weakness of character finding comfort in the woman\u0027s strength. \"Poor Dot!\" thought Julia. His last illness, and the inevitable last sentimental complication, had aged him. Probably he would go next of the Victorians. That would leave only Harrison, Gosse, Hardy, and . . . \"Mr. Paul Flower, madam,\" announced the maid. There entered a pale, hairless sexagenarian who resembled nothing so much as a very large white slug. He greeted them both sluggishly; and began to discuss, with an almost Biblical frankness, the psychology of Lady Hermione Ellerson--whom he had never met. \"A passionate limpet,\" he pronounced her, pulverizing that imaginary mollusc between thumb and forefinger. \"The clinging type. I remember when I was a young man in Paris----\" Paul Flower\u0027s conversation, unfortunately, will no more bear the ordeal of cold print than Rear-Admiral Billy\u0027s. He continued holding forth on the subject of his Parisian youth till interrupted by tea, and Lucien Olphert--a bald-headed, under-sized creature whose real life was as mild as his historical novels were heroic. Various other novelists--Jack Coole, Robert Backwell, and John Binney with Mrs. Binney--dropped in. Literary \"shop,\" inanest of all \"shops\" to an outsider, was in full blast when the maid ushered in Lady Simeon Brunton. The ex-ambassadress swept across Julia\u0027s drawing-room like a well-bred monsoon. Her Paquin confection--frailest gossamer black with gold underskirt--rustled condescension. The ospreys in her Lewis hat waved approving patronage to art and letters. \"You see that I took you at your word, Mrs. Cavendish.\" The hostess, who had been introduced to Lady Simeon (and promptly forgotten her) at a Foreign Office reception some weeks previously, said the appropriate word and made the appropriate presentations. \"But this isn\u0027t a mere social call.\" explained the new-comer. \"This is a call with a purpose.\" She accepted some tea; and subsided on to the sofa. Paul Flower judged her a Philistine (i.e., a woman who did not regard Paul Flower as the last living exponent of English literature), but decided her attractive. He approved her age, about forty-five; her eyes, which were darkly vivacious; her figure, which was inclined to the abundant; her hair and complexion, which were both soigné, the one matching her eyes and the other her pearls. Jack Coole, the two Binneys, and Robert Backwell, his prominent teeth parted in a valedictory grin, departed. Flower, Fancourt, and Olphert continued to talk shop. \"A call with a purpose sounds very serious,\" prompted Julia. Sir Simeon\u0027s wife smiled diplomatically. \"The fact is, dear Mrs. Cavendish, that I want you to dine with us. Next Thursday. You will, won\u0027t you? Although it is such a short invitation. We shall be quite a small party--not more than twenty at the outside. And will you bring your son?\" \"My son----\" Julia, whose inclination was to decline--for some time now, late nights had wearied her--became visibly more gracious. \"Yes. My cousin Hermione--poor dear, what a time she\u0027s been going through--and all this publicity--so distressing for everybody--says he was simply charming to her during the case. So wise! So calm! So helpful! You must be very proud of your son, Mrs. Cavendish.\" Not for nothing had the heiress of The Raneegunge Jute and Cotton Mills married an ambassador! \"Ronnie\u0027s coming to dinner this evening,\" said Ronnie\u0027s mother. \"If he\u0027s free on Thursday we shall both be delighted. May I telephone you?\" 2 Ronnie, who had been watching the polo at Ranelagh, arrived ten minutes late for dinner. He came unannounced into the drawing-room; kissed his mother; complimented her on her clothes (she had changed into a dinner-gown in his honor); and inquired about the afternoon. \"Dullish,\" pronounced Julia--and broached the Brunton invitation. \"The Bruntons!\" He seemed a little taken aback at the name. \"I don\u0027t think I care to go.\" \"Nonsense. Of course you must go. A barrister\u0027s career is mainly social.\" She prolonged the argument over dinner; she mentioned the Brunton \"influence,\" the Ellerson case: till eventually--somewhat against his better judgment--she persuaded him to go. A very different Julia this from the hostess of the afternoon! Always a little constrained, a little too dignified in company; with her son, she hid affection under a mask of brusquerie almost dictatorial. In boyhood Ronnie had been frightened by the mask; even at thirty-six he was only just beginning to realize the affection it concealed. Only since his return from the war had full knowledge of this affection come to him. He saw her now--sipping her coffee in the print-hung, walnut-furnished dining-room--as a lonely old woman dependent on his love. And the sight hurt, because his heart was already aware of the possibility that one day there might be another woman, a younger woman, in his life. \"I wish you\u0027d let me make you a decent allowance,\" she said abruptly. \"You ought to be about everywhere. You ought to stand for Parliament. Even if you don\u0027t get in, it\u0027s an advertisement.\" \"I thought you hated publicity, mater.\" \"So I do--for myself.\" She cogitated. \"I could manage another eight hundred a year.\" \"And deprive yourself of----\" \"Of nothing. I don\u0027t want any money. I\u0027m too old to know how to spend it. You\u0027ll have it all when I\u0027m dead,\" she added. \"Mater!\"--he was the softer in many ways--\"I wish you wouldn\u0027t talk like that.\" \"Why not? Death\u0027s a fact. I\u0027ve no patience with people who won\u0027t face facts. Life isn\u0027t a kinema show.\" Coffee finished, they removed themselves to Julia\u0027s work-room--a square box of an apartment, book-lined, an Empire desk in its exact center under the illuminated top-light. Julia sat down at the desk; opened a drawer; and took out her check-book. \"Eight hundred a year,\" she said, writing. \"That\u0027s two hundred a quarter. I\u0027d better cross the check.\" \"Don\u0027t be absurd, mater.\" Ronnie frowned. \"But I want you to have it.\" \"What for?\" \"Oh, clothes. You ought to dress better. Club subscriptions. Entertaining. Cigars. I don\u0027t know what men spend their money on. Women, mostly, I suppose.\" Blotting the check, she would have given anything in the world to say: \"Ronnie, darling, do take it. I can\u0027t slobber like other women. But I love you--you\u0027re everything I have in the world. Please, please Ronnie, don\u0027t refuse this. It\u0027s not money--it\u0027s just a token--a token of my love for you.\" Actually, she said: \"If your father hadn\u0027t been such a fool about money matters, he\u0027d have left you his estate. He knew that I could always make all I wanted.\" Ronnie frowned again. \"You know perfectly well that I won\u0027t take it.\" \"Not even to oblige me? I--I want you to take it. It may cheer you up. You\u0027ve been looking depressed lately.\" \"Have I?\" They had played this comedy of the allowance more than once since his father\u0027s death; but never before had he seen her so insistent. \"Yes.\" She stretched out the check to him, knowing her offer already rebuffed. In a way, she was proud of his independence. All the same, it hurt. One ought to be able to do more for one\u0027s child. \"I\u0027m not depressed. And I\u0027m not hard up. Really.\" He smiled at her across the desk--one of those rare smiles which reminded her of the boy she had tried to tip at Winchester. She seemed to hear his boyish voice, \"The pater gave me a fiver when he was down last. I don\u0027t need any more. Honestly, mater.\" \"You\u0027re quite sure?\" \"Quite.\" He watched her tear up the check; noticed a sheaf of proofs on her desk; and questioned her about them. \"Another short story!\" \"No. It\u0027s an article on \u0027Easy Divorce\u0027 for next month\u0027s \u0027Contemplatory.\u0027 These are the duplicate proofs.\" \"You\u0027re opposing it?\" \"Of course.\" \"On moral grounds?\" \"Not entirely. Listen!\" She put on her spectacles, and read him the opening paragraphs. \"The woman of to-day is asking that divorce and remarriage should be made easier. Why? Because the woman of to-day refuses to face the simple fact that primarily she is her husband\u0027s helpmate. Personally I am a Churchwoman; and therefore find it impossible to believe the remarriage of divorced people justified. I am willing to admit that, in a limited number of cases, divorce itself may be expedient. But I feel that to make divorce easier would be a direct encouragement of immorality. We have to face facts. Woman is not, never has been, and never will be capable of resisting the sentimental impulse.\" \"You\u0027re a real Puritan at heart, aren\u0027t you, mater?\" he interrupted. She put down the proofs, vaguely distressed that he should prefer her conversation to her written word. For work, to Julia Cavendish, counted more than anything in life--except this lean, clean, sober-minded son of hers. \"It isn\u0027t a very good article, I\u0027m afraid. Dot was in too much of a hurry for it. I never could write quickly.\" These last months she had discovered herself writing even less quickly than usual. Once or twice, even, she had been forced to break off in the middle of the morning by a strange fatigue--a pain in her back. She had meant to consult a doctor; meant to ask Ronnie\u0027s advice. But she hated fussing about herself, hated fussing Ronnie. And besides, Ronnie was depressed--in some trouble or other. She could feel that trouble instinctively. \"You\u0027re sure nothing\u0027s worrying you?\" she asked him as they said good night. \"Quite sure. Sleep well, mater.\" He kissed her, and went. \"No,\" he thought, striding home to the rooms in Jermyn Street which she had insisted on furnishing for him. \"No! Nothing\u0027s wording me. In point of sheer fact, I\u0027ve never been so bucked in my life.\" And he was \"bucked,\" ludicrously so; \"bucked\" because he had yielded to his mother\u0027s persuasions; ludicrously so because, just for the moment, he had altogether forgotten Hector Brunton\u0027s existence. Only when he awoke next morning did Ronald Cavendish remember that Aliette was a married woman--and the possibility that, after all, she might not be one of the guests at her uncle-in-law\u0027s dinner-party. 3 The ambassadorial branch of the Brunton family occupies a palace of a house in that palatial avenue, Kensington Palace Gardens. Driving thither with his mother in the electric brougham with which she compromised between the horseflesh of the Victorian past and the petrol of the democratic present, Ronnie knew himself feverishly excited. All the suppressed emotions of three months leaped to new anticipation as they rolled away from Bruton Street, through Berkeley Square into the park. It was still daylight. Happy lower-middle-class folk crowded the seats under the trees, the grass beyond. Here and there, lovers, splendidly indifferent to the public eye, embraced one another with the frankness of post-wartime. Subconsciously, the sight of these couples affected the serious young man in the silk hat and stiff shirt of formal party-going. Almost he envied them. \"The season has been the fiasco one expected,\" commented his mother. \"Decent people have no money to spend--the other sort don\u0027t know how to spend it. I wish you\u0027d order yourself a new dress-suit, Ronnie. And those waistcoat buttons are very old-fashioned. I must get you some new ones.\" \"Rather a contradictory sentence,\" he commented. \"Nothing of the kind. It\u0027s a man\u0027s duty to be well-groomed.\" She sighed--it had been a tiring day, and she hated dinner-parties. \"I often wish you\u0027d stayed on in the army.\" \"Why?\" \"I think you were happier; and the army, in peace-time, is so healthy.\" \"You do worry about me, don\u0027t you?\" \"Of course. That\u0027s what mothers are for.\" The remark, coming from her, sounded curiously pathetic. For the moment, Ronnie forgot his anticipations. He put a shy hand on his mother\u0027s arm. \"Cheer up, mater,\" he said, seeing her, once again, as a lonely old woman--the intellect, the public fame of her, merest surface-stuff. By now, they were through Hyde Park, and into Kensington Gardens. She removed her arm; made her usual acrid comment on the Albert Memorial; and the pair of them subsided into contemplation. Contemplating, Ronald Cavendish realized for the first time exactly how far he had already drifted toward violation of his mother\u0027s code. He imagined himself saying to Julia, \"Mater, I\u0027m in love with Aliette Brunton.\" But he could not imagine Julia\u0027s reply. The old fear of her came back, chilling him. And yet, code or no code, mother or no mother, he had to admit himself in love, passionately in love with Aliette Brunton. Even the possibility of meeting her thrilled his whole being. Looking back now, he saw that not for one hour since their ride together had she been entirely out of his thoughts. Their electric circled out of the gardens, climbed Palace Green, and swung left between high lights, on to gravel, under an awning. A footman opened the brougham-door. Ronnie, jumping out, helped his mother to alight. \"Thanks, dear. Tell him to be back by eleven,\" she said. Obeying, Ronnie was conscious that he stood in the glare of impatient headlights. Behind and above the glare, through the plate-glass front of the approaching cabriolet, he saw two faces: one heavy-jowled above its starched collar, the other--Aliette\u0027s. 4 \"That looked like young Cavendish. If it was, and you get an opportunity, don\u0027t forget about asking him to dine with us,\" said Hector Brunton. Aliette did not answer; but her gloved hands, as she alighted from her husband\u0027s car, trembled ever so slightly. She had seen him. He had seen her. And the wound, the wound in her heart, was not cured. She could feel it throbbing, throbbing with sheer joy. \"I\u0027m glad I wore this dress,\" she thought. Her chinchilla cloak, ermine at neck and wrists, covered a gown of soft grays and softer mauves, silver-girdled. Pearls gleamed at her lustrous throat, in the tiny ears under her vivid hair. Crossing the black-and-white tessellated hall to the ambassadorial cloak-room, she looked a very picture of dignified composure. But the composure was mainly superficial. Her heart throbbed and throbbed. She forgot Hector, remembered only Ronnie. This stately old lady, just being divested of her mandarin opera-cloak, must be his mother. She resembled him, about the chin, about the eyes. \"What a charming woman!\" thought Julia Cavendish. \"I wonder if she\u0027s Hector Brunton\u0027s wife. I wish I could find a wife like that for Ronnie.\" \"I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re the last,\" smiled the elder woman, eying the formidable collection of furs. \"I\u0027m afraid so too,\" smiled back the younger. She took off her own cloak; gave one swift glance at the mirror, and was ready. \"Practical, too. Makes no fuss about herself,\" thought Julia Cavendish, as they re?ntered the hall together. Aliette could not think. The meeting, unanticipated, had taken her off her guard. Delight, apprehension, sheer eagerness, and sheer diffidence made her utterly the girl. It seemed as though, at the instant, something tremendous must occur. But nothing tremendous occurred! Or if it did, their social sense saw them through it. Ronnie was talking to Hector in the hall. He shook hands with Aliette. He introduced her to his mother. He introduced Hector to his mother. The four of them went up the wide stairs together. Aliette heard them announced, \"Mr. and Mrs. Hector Brunton. Mrs. Julia Cavendish. Mr. Ronald Cavendish.\" How silly she had been about him. How calm he was! How calm they both were! Naturally! He hardly knew her. They hardly knew one another. Hector Brunton\u0027s wife realized suddenly that her left glove had split in the clenched palm, that she had forgotten to take off her gloves before entering the drawing-room. \"My dear child, how are you? En beauté, as always. A credit to the family.\" She found herself, among a mob of people, shaking hands with Simeon. 5 The craftswoman in Julia Cavendish, the literary memory and sense of \"copy\" which make her books such exact social pictures, functioned quite independently from the rest of her personality. No one, watching her as she talked international politics with her host, would have guessed that, behind the calm, dignified face, the novelist\u0027s brain was busy. Kodak-like, that brain registered its impressions, rolling them away for development at leisure. First impression: an oblong room--paneled--Venetian bracket-lights--brocaded French windows either end--low scarlet flowers on a long gold-decked table, narrowing as you looked down it--many faces either side, two faces at each end--hum of subdued conversation--servants\u0027 white-gloved hands and dark-coated arms proffering bottles, plates, dishes. The camera in the brain clicks, rolls away the picture. Second impression: Sir Simeon, sixty-eight, a little man, white-haired, blue-eyed, mustache floppy, charming, not very efficient, presumably the weaker matrimonial vessel--his wife ought never to wear pink--Sir Simeon\u0027s three daughters, obviously by his first marriage, two with wedding-rings, thirty-eight, thirty-six, nonentities--their partners ditto--an ugly one, younger, rather interesting. \"My sympathies are entirely with the Jugo-Slavs, Sir Simeon. Italy is not entitled to a yard of territory more than we guaranteed her by the Treaty of London,\" says Julia Cavendish, society-woman. The camera continues its work. Third impression: the secretary of the Spanish embassy would look exactly like a bull-fighter if he wore the national costume instead of civilized evening-dress--General Fellowes has aged since the War Office inquiry--a fine type--the big woman he has taken in to dinner would look like a cantaloup melon if you cut her in two--the pretty girl flirting with the young soldier (Guards?) must be her daughter. \"Aren\u0027t you rather hard on our allies, Mrs. Cavendish?\" chips in Hector Brunton. \"I have no patience with d\u0027Annunzio.\" \"But at least you will admit that he is a patriot,\" protests Sir Simeon. \"No bombastic person is really patriotic. Patriotism is a dumb virtue.\" \"But is patriotism a virtue?\" asks the K.C. \"Almost the greatest.\" Julia\u0027s mental camera snaps again. Impression of Hector Brunton: a would-be cave-man--not as strong as he imagines himself--putty in the hands of a sexful woman--rather a difficult problem for a fastidious wife--obstinate--capable of cruelty. At which precise moment, the mother ousted the craftswoman from Julia\u0027s brain. She began to wonder if Ronnie were enjoying himself. If only he weren\u0027t so shy with women! Women made men\u0027s careers. He had taken down that charming Mrs. Brunton. She looked down the table and caught his eyes across the scarlet flowers. He smiled at her. He must be enjoying himself. She had done right, then, to make him accept the invitation. \"I gather you prefer patriotism to the League of Nations,\" remarked her host. \"Your League of Nations,\" answered Julia, \"is merely the sentimental impulse translated into terms of international diplomacy. Every one wants it to work--every one realizes it unworkable.\" Answering, she thought that she had rarely seen Ronnie look so happy. But not even the mother in Julia Cavendish knew the cause of Ronnie\u0027s happiness; she was as blind to her son\u0027s infatuation as Hector Brunton to his wife\u0027s. She could not divine that the pair of them had passed beyond mere happiness into a little illusive world of their own making. For the moment, Aliette and Ronnie dwelt in a rose-bubble of enchantment. A frail bubble! Yet it cut them off, as surely as though it had been opaque crystal, from their fellow-guests. Physical passion found no place in that rose-bubble. Their bodies, the bodies which made pretense of eating and drinking, which uttered the most absurdly conventional sentiments, dwelt outside of its magic; while within, their minds, their natures, their very souls, held secret commune--as two friends so set in friendship that words have become unnecessary. Yet actually, magic apart, they were merely a man and a woman, each lonely, each too healthy for that loneliness which is the prerogative of the sick and the abnormal. They had been lonely; now they were no longer lonely. They had been obsessed with visions of each other; now they no longer saw visions. They saw each other; and their souls were satisfied. But of all that their souls knew, their lips spoke no word. \"I\u0027ve often thought about that run we had,\" said the man. \"One doesn\u0027t get a gallop like that every day of one\u0027s life. Did you have many other good days?\" \"I didn\u0027t go out again last season,\" said the woman. \"Really? How was that?\" \"Oh, I went down to Devonshire with my sister.\" \"You didn\u0027t take Miracle?\" \"No.\" It pleased her that he remembered Miracle\u0027s name. \"By the way, I\u0027m quite angry with you, Mr. Cavendish. Mr. Wilberforce told us on Sunday that you preferred golf to our society.\" \"Jimmy\u0027s a mischief-maker. Why isn\u0027t your sister here to-night, Mrs. Brunton?\" Man-like, he wondered--now--why he had refused to call on her. \"Mollie\u0027s at a dance. I believe Mr. Wilberforce will be there too.\" \"Jimmy\u0027s a great dancer.\" Did she know, he speculated, about Jimmy and her sister? Probably. Women--according to Ronnie--always told one another that sort of thing. \"And you?\" she asked. \"Oh, I\u0027m like the Tenth. I don\u0027t dance.\" Aliette dimpled to laughter at the old jest. It mattered so little what he said to her with his lips. His eyes gave her the answer to the one question; the only question she had ever asked herself in vain. His eyes said: \"Yes. This is Love. This is the Real Thing.\" She wondered if his brain knew the message of his eyes. She marveled at herself for not having sooner known the message of her heart. \"I\u0027m in love with him,\" she thought. \"I\u0027ve been in love with him ever since that Sunday at Key Hatch.\" All the gray unease of the past months, of the past years, diffused to amber sunshine. The Spanish secretary, sitting on her right, chimed in to their conversation. \"You do not dance, Cavendish. That is strange. I thought all English people danced.\" The rose-bubble of enchantment was broken. Talk grew general. Dinner drew to its end. 6 \"You look a little tired, Mrs. Cavendish. Can\u0027t I get you some more coffee? A cigarette, perhaps?\" \"Thank you so much. I think I would like a cigarette.\" Aliette and Julia sat together in a palm-screened corner of the vast Louis Quinze drawing-room. The men were still downstairs. The younger woman rose; and fetched a silver cigarette-box, matches. Julia lit her cigarette. She felt very old, very weary, quite unlike herself. The pain nagged at her back. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not a very gay companion for a beautiful young woman. You mustn\u0027t mind my paying you compliments.\" Aliette had raised a protesting hand at the word \"beautiful.\" \"When I was your age, compliments were in vogue. Nowadays they\u0027re out of fashion--like good manners.\" \"Surely good manners are never out of fashion,\" said Aliette. \"Only--like fashions--they change.\" Lady Simeon veered toward them, but diverted her course. They talked on, drawn to each other by a kindred obsession--Ronnie. \"I\u0027d love to ask her what she thought of him,\" mused Julia Cavendish. \"I simply daren\u0027t mention her son,\" mused Aliette Brunton. Thus the man found them when he came upstairs. They made an exquisite picture, there, under the green--his mother, dignified, strong (not wishing to let him guess her weariness, she had pulled herself together at his approach), the halo of intellectual achievement setting her apart from every other woman in the room; and the vivid, exquisite, but equally dignified creature at his mother\u0027s side. \"You don\u0027t often smoke, mater.\" He felt consoled that these two should be together. For the last twenty minutes the sight of Hector Brunton--holding forth, loud-voiced, over a cigar--had made him feel a little guilty. \"Mrs. Brunton insisted. Come and sit down, Ronnie. Unless\"--servants with card-tables made a belated appearance--\"you want to play bridge.\" \"I\u0027d just as soon talk.\" They made place for him. He and his mother began to discuss their fellow-guests, critically, but without malice. Listening, Aliette felt like an interloper. Even if she had been unmarried, how could she interpose her love--for it was love, she knew that now, knew it irremediably--between these two? Her mind reacted from happiness to depression. He said to her, \"You\u0027re looking very thoughtful.\" She answered absent-mindedly, \"Am I?\" He said: \"Yes. Don\u0027t you want to play? They\u0027re making up tables.\" She said: \"No. I\u0027d rather sit here and watch.\" Sir Simeon drifted up to them, bringing the young Guardee and the pretty girl he had taken down to dinner. The pair were still flirting, butterfly-like. Their host had insisted on introducing them to Julia. They suffered the introduction, and flitted away. \"Who is Julia Cavendish?\" asked the boy. \"Silly! She writes poetry,\" answered the girl. \"Oh, I say, ought I to have read it?\" \"Of course you ought. I wish we were going to dance, don\u0027t you?\" \"Rather.\" The cantaloup lady rolled up to Sir Simeon, and dragged him away to show her his pictures. Julia relapsed into mono-syllables. It must be nearly half-past ten. Thank goodness! She could just manage another thirty minutes. Meanwhile Ronnie could continue talking to this pretty woman. Perhaps he would stay on. That would be best. She wanted to go home alone. In the morning she could telephone Dot for the name of his doctor. And so, once again, the rose-bubble of enchantment formed itself about those two lovers. But now both were conscious of the bubble\u0027s frailty. And the man thought: \"This cannot endure. I cannot endure this. To-night must be the last time we meet.\" He saw her husband, pompous, considering the call of a hand. He knew that he abhorred Brunton for the possession of this exquisite woman. He loathed himself for abhorring Brunton. The woman, too, saw her husband. But she could only feel sorrow for him. Poor Hector, who would have been satisfied with so little of her; who had never known how much she had to give. And now--now no man would ever know. Unless----Her fastidiousness revolted abruptly from introspection. She felt glad of Julia\u0027s: \"I think the brougham should be here by now, Ronnie. Do you mind finding out? And don\u0027t worry to see me home. I\u0027m sure Mrs. Brunton will never forgive me if I drag you away.\" \"Don\u0027t be absurd, mater. Of course I sha\u0027n\u0027t let you go home by yourself.\" Ronnie rose, and made his way across the room. \"You\u0027ll persuade him to stop? I--I\u0027d rather go home alone,\" said Julia. \"Because you\u0027re tired. Because you don\u0027t want him to see it.\" The words escaped Aliette before she could control them. She covered herself quickly. \"I\u0027m sure that must be the reason. I\u0027m sure, if I had a son, I should never want him to think that I was tired.\" \"You have children then--girls? You couldn\u0027t have known otherwise.\" The novelist in Julia was asleep; she could see no other reason why this \"charming creature\" should have divined her mentality. \"No. I have no children, worse luck!\" Ronnie came back to say that the brougham waited. \"You mustn\u0027t come with me, Ronnie.\" Julia got to her feet. \"Mater, I insist.\" \"Persuade him to stay, Mrs. Brunton.\" Subconsciously, Aliette knew the incident momentous.
