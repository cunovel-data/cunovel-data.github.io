{"id":33009,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II","content":"1 \"You can\u0027t possibly want to brush it any more, Caroline.\" Aliette\u0027s maid, a square-hipped, square-shouldered, square-faced woman who had been in service with the Fullerford family ever since Judge Fullerford came back from Trinidad, laid the ivory-backed hair-brushes on the dressing-table, and began to twine the vivid coils round the small head. There is neither gas nor electric light at Moor Park. In the slanted oval of the old-fashioned mirror, Aliette could only see, either side of her rather serious face, two primrose points of candle-flame. The long low bedroom behind her--furnished in mid-Victorian mahogany, Morris-papered with tiny roses on an exiguous trellis--was almost in darkness, darkness against which the primrose candle-glow showed Aliette\u0027s full beauty. You saw her now--bathed after hunting, peacock-blue kimono round her dimpled shoulders--as a creature of supreme health. Her arms were smooth, lustrous; her wrists rounded; her hands small, a little broad in the palm--resolute strong hands for all their smallness. Her neck was smooth, full, lustrous as her arms; her bosoms low and firm; her feet fine; her legs, under their black silk stockings, slim-ankled and smooth-muscled--almost classic in their perfection. Caroline Staley\u0027s mistress hardly moved while Caroline Staley completed the simple hair-dressing. Her deliberate mind was busy with the past day. She relived it--moment by moment,--loving it. The primeval instinct which had momentarily and subconsciously troubled her was asleep again, lulled to civilized quiescence by the air and the exercise. She remembered her pursuer in the field only as a pleasant companionable figure against the background of March sunlight and English countryside. Nevertheless, she found herself wishing, vaguely, that he were coming to dinner that night. It would be a dullish dinner. Her husband had arrived by the afternoon train, bringing the usual bagful of legal papers to assimilate over the week-end, and her sister Mollie. Mollie and Hector always got on well with each other. She had found them taking tea together when she arrived home; and left them alone after a brief greeting. The Rev. Adrian was to be there, with his bishop\u0027s daughter. \"Billy\" would want to know all about the day\u0027s run. \"Dear Billy!\" Hector Brunton\u0027s wife inspected her maid\u0027s handiwork, and rose to be frocked. Mollie came in without knocking; lit another candle or so, and helped with a hook or two. \"Nice frock,\" decided Mollie Fullerford, surveying Aliette\u0027s black lace and silver tissue. Her voice resembled Aliette\u0027s; but there resemblance ended. The girl stood half a head taller than the woman. She had violet eyes, a broadish brow, and dark, almost black hair, bobbed during convalescence. Her coloring was white in comparison with Aliette\u0027s cream; but two patches of natural bloom glowed in her cheeks. She wore a panniered dress of blue and mauve shot taffeta, wide over the hips, tight round the ankles, short-sleeved, neck cut high to conceal one of her wound-scars. Her arms, hands, and feet, well-shaped as her sister\u0027s, looked more powerful. Altogether rather a hefty, healthy, happy young creature--the sort of creature a decent hefty young man would single out at a dance. \"No nicer than yours,\" retorted Aliette, slipping her rings on her fingers, and adjusting the short single string of pearls round her throat. A knuckle rapped the door-panels; a loudish voice asked: \"May I come in, dear?\" \"Yes. I\u0027m just ready.\" Hector entered--a big, over-big man, the glazed shirt-front already bulging out of his black waistcoat. The K.C., shorn of legal wig and trappings, did not look very dignified; nevertheless, he gave an impression of force. The sandy hair was scant on his wide mottled forehead; his eyes were a cold gray; his nose tended to the bulbous. The clean-shaven lips appeared thin and a trifle cruel; his jowl was heavy--almost the jowl of a mastiff. He had the hands of a gentleman, the feet of a clodhopper. \"Is it time for dinner?\" asked the wife. The husband drew from his waistcoat pocket a heavy gold watch; consulted the hands of it; and admitted the accuracy of her suggestion. \"Then we\u0027d better be going down,\" decided Aliette. 2 The dining-room at Moor Park possesses, or is possessed by, the largest suite of mid-Victorian mahogany ever fashioned. The sideboard, gleaming always with massive silver, occupies the entire east end of the apartment, barely leaving room for a white-paneled Adams door. Either side of the marble mantelpiece stand two colossal serving-tables. Gigantic horsehair-seated armchairs, ranged between the long red-curtained windows, spill a brood of slightly less gigantic offspring round the mastodontic board. The mulligatawny and the cod with oyster-sauce had already been served by the two cap-and-aproned wenches, whom the rear-admiral declared to be \"a damned sight better than any heavy-handed son of a gun who smoked a fellow\u0027s cigars, drank his port, and did as little work as the old bumboat-woman of Portsmouth.\" Rear-Admiral Billy was enjoying himself. His jovial eyes, a little red-rimmed with age under the heavy brown thatch of his hair, kept glancing round at \"his two colts and their fillies\" (one is, alas! forced to modify a good many of the admiral\u0027s pet expressions) and at that \"jolly little piece in the No. 5 rig,\" Aliette\u0027s sister. His trim beard, grayed only at the extremities, kept wagging accompaniment to Aliette\u0027s account of the run; the course of which his hairy-backed hands were trying to trace, in bread and salt, on the table-cloth. \"\u0027Spose you funked as usual, Adrian,\" rumbled the old man across the enormous table. \"God knows what I\u0027ve ever done to deserve a son in the church.\" The Rev. Adrian, in clerical evening dress, only laughed at his father\u0027s criticism; but the Rev. Adrian\u0027s Margery fired up in defense of her spouse. \"Adrian\u0027s seen more active service than most men of his cloth,\" began the little aquiline, dark-haired, dark-eyed, dark-skinned, and darkly determined woman, who dressed (when natural circumstances permitted her--as they did not at the moment) with the severe precision of unadorned royalty. Aliette continued her low-voiced description of the day\u0027s run; Hector tried explaining to an attentive Mollie the exact difference between a disbarred barrister and a solicitor who has been struck off the rolls; the cap-and-aproned wenches set an enormous joint of mutton before the host, who always insisted on carving with his own hands; and dinner proceeded. To Hector Brunton\u0027s wife the dullish meal was less unpleasant than her anticipation of it. She liked her father-in-law--though his occasional coarseness always jarred her sensitive mind. She appreciated her sister\u0027s week-end visit; and anticipated with some pleasure the family talk which would precede their going to bed. But above all, she liked being away from the constraining intimacy of her home with Hector. Recently Hector had been growing more and more difficult to deny. She caught him looking at her now, sideways across the vast white of the table-cloth. Vaguely she felt sorry for him. His cold eyes almost held an appeal. \"Look round,\" they seemed to be saying, \"it isn\u0027t so bad; really it isn\u0027t so bad, this little family party. Can\u0027t we make it up, you and I?\" \"Poor Hector!\" she thought. \"He\u0027s a very simple person. He doesn\u0027t understand\"; and checked thought, not abruptly, but with the same quiet firmness she had applied to Miracle that morning. For Aliette never posed, even to herself. She was the very antithesis of the usual misunderstood married woman; so far, the mere thought of a compensating lover had never entered her head. All that happened afterward--and sometimes, looking back, it seems to her as though it all began from that chance remark of Adrian\u0027s--happened of its own volition. At the moment Adrian spoke she was just an ordinary woman, who had married an ordinary man in the expectation of a home and children, found him out in various infidelities, and decided--after due thought--that she could no longer pay his physical price for the dwindling possibility of motherhood. \"We had young Cavendish out with us to-day,\" said the parson. \"Julia Cavendish\u0027s son. You know him, I suppose, Hector?\" \"Yes. Clever fellow. No orator, but very sound on his law. He\u0027s doing junior to me in the Ellerson case. Rather an interesting case----\" \"He and Aliette gave us all a lead.\" \"Rides well, does he?\" \"Rather. A fine horseman. Handsome looking chap, too.\" The parson glanced at his sister-in-law, not maliciously, yet with a certain puzzlement. Listening with half an ear to her description of the run, he had wondered why she made no mention of the stranger. \"Didn\u0027t you think so, Aliette?\" he went on. \"I can\u0027t say I noticed his looks. He certainly rides well.\" The wallflower-brown eyes betrayed no startle, the pale, cream-tinged cheeks did not blush. Nevertheless, deep down in the inmost recesses of her nature, Aliette felt herself startle, not guiltily, but in wonderment at her inexplicable omission. What possible reason could there be for not mentioning the man? Adrian continued to discuss Ronnie, and Ronnie\u0027s mother, and Maurice Cavendish, whom he had encountered years since at Oxford. \"His son\u0027s rather like him; but of course he\u0027s got the Wixton chin,\" said Adrian. All the time Adrian talked, Aliette was asking herself questions. Why hadn\u0027t she even mentioned the man\u0027s name? Why? Why? Why? Harking back to her conversation, she seemed to have made the omission deliberately. She tried to laugh herself out of the absurd mood; to join in the conversation. Deliberate? Ridiculous! She just hadn\u0027t thought about him. And yet, subconsciously, the man\u0027s face rose up before her, serious and strangely vivid against the glow of the table-candles. She could almost hear his voice, \"I\u0027ll give you a lead over, Mrs. Brunton.\" 3 \"Do you know, Alie, I\u0027ve sometimes thought that you and Hector don\u0027t get on very well together.\" Mollie, in dressing-gown and bedroom slippers, sat on the edge of her sister\u0027s bed. Margery Brunton, inclining to the aggressive about her forthcoming infant, departed early; and the two Fullerfords had been talking for nearly an hour, quite unsentimentally, about frocks, parents, books, a theater or so. \"What makes you say that?\" Aliette, shoulder-deep in bedclothes, looked up from her pillow. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know.\" The girl blushed; and there fell a moment\u0027s awkward silence, during which it flashed through Aliette\u0027s sleepy mind that perhaps Hector had been confiding their matrimonial differences to his sister-in-law. But she dismissed the thought: Hector\u0027s reticence, even about small matters, was proverbial in the family. Besides, the reason for Mollie\u0027s question was sufficiently obvious. \"We get on as well as most married people, I expect,\" protested Hector Brunton\u0027s wife. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m a terrible sentimentalist,\" went on Mollie. \"Sometimes,\" she blushed again, \"I think I\u0027m even worse than that. I\u0027ve never met a man I liked well enough to marry. Though, of course, I\u0027ve let two or three men make love to me. It\u0027s rather nice to feel that a man\u0027s fond of you.\" She hesitated, and broke off--Aliette being hardly the kind of sister to whom one confided one\u0027s love-affairs. \"Most women are awful rotters,\" said the girl, after a long pause. Aliette restrained the retort at her lips; and Mollie\u0027s na?ve revelations continued. \"Most men aren\u0027t. They\u0027ve got a higher sense of honor than we have. I found that out while I was nursing. Reading the women\u0027s letters to fellows who\u0027d been gas-blinded. There was one, I remember, who wanted a divorce. She wrote: \u0027I\u0027m afraid I haven\u0027t been playing the game while you\u0027ve been away.\u0027 And she didn\u0027t seem a bit ashamed of herself.\" \"Did you read him the letter?\" interrupted Aliette. \"No. But I wrote to the woman; and she wrote back, thanking me. Thanking me!\" Mollie\u0027s voice rose. \"She\u0027d decided that \u0027after all, and especially as he was so bad, it would be better not to tell him. Would I burn her silly letter?\u0027 I think that\u0027s beastly.\" Her violet eyes kindled. \"I\u0027m not a prig. I don\u0027t believe divorce is wrong. But I do consider it dirty, when a woman or a man do--that sort of thing.\" Aliette\u0027s face, smooth on its pillows between braided coils, gave no hint of the thoughts in her mind. Vaguely she resented an unmarried girl, or, in fact, any woman discussing \"that sort of thing\"; but her resentment, she knew, would only make the younger generation laugh. The younger generation of girls, as represented by Mollie, did not believe in squeamishness. Perhaps--Aliette seemed to remember that Julia Cavendish had touched on the subject in her last novel--the younger generation were no less virtuous because they faced facts instead of hiding their heads, ostrich-like, in the sands of innocence. \"I don\u0027t see,\" Mollie\u0027s decided voice closed the conversation, \"why being in love should prevent one from playing the game.\" She rose, gathered her dressing-gown round her, asked if she should blow out the candle, did so, and made for the door. \"By the way,\" said the figure silhouetted against the glow of the corridor-lamp, \"I suppose there\u0027s a service at Key Hatch to-morrow afternoon. If there is, let\u0027s go. It\u0027s such a ripping little church; and I can\u0027t bear being preached to by Adrian.\" \"If you like, dear,\" replied an unguarded Aliette. But when the door closed and she lay alone in darkness, her mind reverted to its problem, to that peculiar omission of Ronald Cavendish\u0027s name. 4 Morning broke to gusts of rain. Hector locked himself in the library; the admiral inspected his greenhouses; Mollie refused to get up; and Aliette wrote letters. Somehow, the letters took a long while to write. She found herself, pen in raised hand, dreaming. In her day-dreams happiness and dissatisfaction mingled incoherently, as the voices of two people heard through a wall. She could not catch the words of the voices, only the tones of them: one low-laughing, the other querulous. For the first time since girlhood--and even in girlhood she had been deliberate--deliberate thought abandoned her. She felt content that her mind should drift idly through an idle day. Only when Mollie--appearing brogued and tweeded for luncheon--reminded her of the agreed church-going, did her brain resume its normal function. \"In all probability I shall see Ronald Cavendish\"--the thought came startlingly as Aliette watched Hector at work on the inevitable roast beef and Yorkshire pudding of the admiral\u0027s Sabbath. \"I hope I shall see Ronald Cavendish\"--so distinct were the words that they might have been actually spoken. \"It\u0027s clearing up,\" announced her father-in-law. \"You\u0027ll have a jolly walk. Ought to start about half-past three. Better have some tea at the Bull. Service is at half-past five.\" \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll go,\" said Aliette. \"I\u0027ve got rather a headache.\" \"Do your headache good,\" rumbled the admiral. She pulled herself together. Why shouldn\u0027t she go to Key Hatch; why shouldn\u0027t she meet Ronald Cavendish? Not, of course, that she really wanted to meet Ronald Cavendish. . . . 5 \"I wonder why on earth I invented that headache,\" thought Aliette, as she and Mollie tramped down the drive. Hector had returned to work in the library; he waved them au revoir from the desk by the window. A fantasy came to her: \"I shall never see Hector again.\" She said to herself: \"I hope he hasn\u0027t gone back to town.\" She said to herself: \"Aliette, don\u0027t be an absolute idiot.\" For, after all, could anything be more idiotic than that a woman of nearly thirty--and that woman Mrs. Brunton, Mrs. Hector Brunton, wife of Hector Brunton, K.C.--should feel like--like a schoolgirl going to meet her first choir-boy? And yet, instinctively, Aliette knew herself somehow caught, somehow entangled. No escape from that knowledge! Ridiculous or not, this stranger she was going to meet--of course they would meet him; he couldn\u0027t have gone back to town--interested her. Interested her enormously. She saw him again in the eyes of her mind, his serious face, his blue eyes, his hair--such curious hair, goldy-gray as though bleached by the tropics,--all the while she swung, listening to Mollie\u0027s chatter, along the familiar lanes. A low sun, emerging from between gold-edged clouds, shone on them walking. The hedges dripped cool sparkles. Cow-parsley pushed its feathery green through the tangled grass of the ditches. They topped the rise by Moor Farm, and saw Key Hatch below them. It lay in a cup of the valley, gray and brown and slate-blue through leafless branches against the concave jade of pasture-land. Half a mile on, midway between them and the village, two figures strolled up-hill. Social sense, banishing idiotic fantasies, reasserted itself in Hector Brunton\u0027s wife; and, five minutes later, the four figures met. \"How do you do, Mrs. Brunton?\" \"How do you do, Mr. Cavendish?\" Ronnie introduced his friend; Aliette introduced them both to Mollie. The friend, James Wilberforce, carried his five feet eleven well. He had broad shoulders and a rather clever face, aquiline of nose, brown-eyed, high cheek-boned, full-lipped under a \"toothbrushed\" mustache. His mustache and his hair only just escaped being carroty. His voice carried a faint suggestion of superciliousness. \"An overworked solicitor,\" he told them with a humorous twinkle of his brown eyes, \"taking a day off in the country.\" He was \"charmed\" to meet Mrs. Brunton. He had had the pleasure of knowing her husband for some years. \"A great man.\" Mollie liked the way he spoke. She thought him much more agreeable than Mr. Cavendish, who appeared to her rather a sobersides--almost ill at ease, in fact. \"We were just having a stroll before tea,\" announced Wilberforce, after about five minutes of uninspired conversation. \"And we are going to have tea at the Bull before church,\" retorted the girl. \"So we\u0027d better all have tea together.\" She marched Wilberforce off down the hill. Her sister and Cavendish followed slowly. Now that they had actually met, Aliette felt thoroughly ashamed of the mental fuss she had made about him. He was a perfectly ordinary man, who happened to have given her a lead over Parson\u0027s Brook. Rather a nice man, of course. She liked the way he wore his clothes, his assumption that she did not require him to chatter. He walked--she noticed in the gathering twilight--almost as well as he rode, easily from the hips. \"You\u0027ve let your pipe out,\" she told him. He stopped to rekindle it; and she saw that his hand trembled ever so slightly in the glow of the match. \"Nervy,\" she thought. She did not divine that the long scholarly fingers trembled because the man had scarcely slept for overmuch thinking of the woman at his side; that he had been saying to himself, ever since he espied her on the brow of the hill, \"Don\u0027t be a fool. Don\u0027t be a damn fool. She\u0027s Hector Brunton\u0027s wife.\" That afternoon her sheer physical beauty thrilled him like fine poetry. He had no idea how she was dressed. Her clothes seemed part of her--deep wallflower brown, the color of her eyes. He wanted to acknowledge her beauty, to say: \"You\u0027re wonderful; too wonderful for any man\u0027s sight.\" Actually, he opined that they had had a jolly run, and hoped he\u0027d get another day with the Mid-Oxfordshire some time or other. On horseback he could thrust with the best of them, this long, loose-limbed young man with the serious face above the Wixton chin; but he was no thruster after women. Too much the poet for that--one of those many dumb poets who have no desire to flaunt their emotions in cold print. The four came down the hill, Mollie and Wilberforce still leading, round a whitewashed farmhouse, along a strip of wet road whereon a few bowler-hatted chawbacons strolled arm-in-arm with their red-cheeked, silent Dollies, under leafless elm branches, into the main--and only--street of Key Hatch. England\u0027s Sabbath brooded obviously over stone cottages, picturesquely inefficient, flower-pots blocking their tiny windows, doors closed. Already, here and there behind the flower-pots, an extravagant light twinkled. Half-way down the street, its bow-windows inhospitably blinded, stood the Bull, relic of posting-days, whose rusty signboard had so far failed to attract the motorist. At street-end, dark against the cold cloud-banks of declining day, loomed the square tower of Key Hatch Church. Mollie and Wilberforce waited at the side door of the inn till the others joined them. \"You won\u0027t mind having tea in my sitting-room. I\u0027m afraid there isn\u0027t a fire anywhere else,\" said Cavendish; and led his three guests down a narrow corridor--rigid fish in glass cases and an iron hatstand its only decorations--into a parlor where firelight danced invitingly. Wilberforce lit the lamp, revealing a five-legged tea-table set for two, a hard sofa, three antimacassared chairs, a stuffed barn-owl between Britannia-ware candlesticks on the mantelpiece, and the usual litter of photographs in sea-shell frames without which no English inn considers itself furnished. Cavendish jerked the bell-tassel; Mrs. Wiggins, a pleasant-featured young woman already attired for church-going, bustled in with the brown teapot; nearly courtesied to Aliette; bustled out again, and reappeared with the extra utensils. \"You\u0027ll pour out for us, won\u0027t you, Mrs. Brunton?\" asked the host. \"If you like.\" Aliette spoke in her usual deliberate way. But now, for the first time, she felt self-conscious. Was her hat on straight? Had she remembered to powder her nose before starting? Pouring tea, handing cups, busied with the most ordinary social duties, there swept over her mind the most extraordinary fantasies. And quite suddenly she wanted to take off her hat! \"But this is ridiculous,\" she said to herself. \"I can\u0027t take off my hat.\" Nevertheless she wanted to. She must! This was his room. His cap lay on the sofa, his pipe on the mantelpiece. Therefore . . . She realized with amazement that her hands were already raised to her head. \"Alie, you haven\u0027t given me any sugar.\" Her sister\u0027s irritated voice dispelled the moment\u0027s illusion. One hand dropped to her lap, the other to the sugar-tongs. \"Sorry, dear.\" She recognized the shyness in her own words, and covered shyness with a conventional laugh, \"I\u0027m getting forgetful in my old age.\" Discussing ages with their bread and butter, they made the original discovery that a woman is as old as she looks, et cetera. Over hunks of Mrs. Wiggins\u0027s home-made cake, Ronald admitted to thirty-six, Wilberforce to forty. \"You don\u0027t look forty,\" decided Mollie: and at that moment, just as she was thinking she had never listened to a more artificial conversation, Aliette trapped her host\u0027s blue eyes in a glance no woman could possibly mistake. In a way the glance, so momentary, so quickly veiled that only her heart assured her that she had actually seen it, resembled the glance she had trapped in her husband\u0027s eyes over dinner. And yet it was utterly different. It held reverence, a resigned hopelessness, a devotional quality of which Hector\u0027s cold gray pupils could never be capable. Now, with amazement, she knew herself panicked. Panicked, not because of the look in his eyes, but because she realized that, in another second, her own would have responded to them. She was not \"shocked\" at his daring; her inaccessible beauty had not passed through seven years of married life in London without various similar experiences. But she was \"shocked\" at her own impulse. Heretofore such glances, even the words which on occasion accompanied them, had left her completely indifferent, utterly uncaring, positively contemptuous. This--did not leave her indifferent. This--this mattered. . . . Subconsciously, she who never swore began swearing at herself. \"You\u0027re a fool, Aliette. A damn fool.\" Doubt nagged her. \"You made a mistake. You only imagined that glance.\" The code nagged her. \"Even if you didn\u0027t imagine it, he had no right----\" And all the time her outward self, the socially-trained Aliette, was behaving as though nothing unusual had occurred, filling teacups, nibbling cake, talking this or that triviality. No, she was not an ardent church-goer. Yes, her brother-in-law preached splendidly. But she objected to seeing him in the pulpit. Why? She didn\u0027t quite know why; it seemed too intimate, somehow or other. Like being introduced to the Deity as a relation by marriage. Mollie and Wilberforce laughed at that. Their laughter disturbed Aliette. She and Cavendish sat stupidly silent till church-bells began. \"You\u0027d better come with us. It will do you both good,\" said Mollie to the solicitor. \"I haven\u0027t been inside a church since I left the army,\" declared Wilberforce. \"All the more reason to come with us,\" smiled Mollie, who liked this big auburn man, had liked him more and more ever since he was first introduced. And to church, casually, those four went. 6 As she knelt by the stone pillar on the thin hard hassock, it seemed to Hector Brunton\u0027s wife that she had forgotten how to pray, that her eyes were being drawn sideways through her fingers. Only by concentrating could she achieve a moment\u0027s devotion. Settling herself back in the pew, she was vividly aware of Cavendish\u0027s proximity. By no means a fanatic, Aliette nevertheless accepted her father\u0027s Protestantism. Religion formed part of the code, of those indubitable laws on which one based existence. But on this particular evening Protestantism seemed a farce. She could not imagine any god taking pleasure in the gas-lit ceremonial, in the vacuous-eyed congregation, in the artificial intonations of the parson or the hymn-numbers on the board. All these seemed hugely distant from any concept of worship. Somehow, she caught herself yearning for a richer ceremonial, for a warmer faith. Somehow, she seemed to remember--dimly out of childhood--her grandmother\u0027s voice: \"My dear, we\u0027ve decided to forgive. But, O Marie! aren\u0027t you lonely? Don\u0027t you feel as though God had gone out of your life?\" And her mother\u0027s voice seemed to answer: \"Mother, can\u0027t you understand? It\u0027s the same God. He hasn\u0027t gone out of my life just because I worship Him differently. He couldn\u0027t abandon any woman who sacrificed herself for love\u0027s sake.\" The two voices faded into the past. But now Aliette realized struggle in her soul. It was as though her soul stood at bay, at bay with some terrible decision; as though her soul were being swept toward some contest whose ending, whether victory or defeat, only God could foresee. Once again she felt panic. Yet how should there be panic here in Key Hatch Church? Already they were singing the last hymn. This man, this man beside her was called Cavendish. Ronald Cavendish! She could see his eyes, now dropped to the hymn-book, now raised again. She could see his ungloved hands on the pew-rail. She could hear his voice. And abruptly, panic passed; abruptly, she felt the very spirit of her a-thrill, a-thrill as though to fine music. 7 Hector Brunton\u0027s wife and Julia Cavendish\u0027s son said good-by to each other in the cottage-twinkling darkness at the foot of Key Hatch hill, shaking hands coolly, impersonally--merest acquaintances. Indeed, Aliette\u0027s \"Good night, Mr. Cavendish\" sounded a hundred times less cordial than Mollie\u0027s \"I hope we shall meet again, Mr. Wilberforce.\" And yet forty-eight hours later Aliette bolted. She bolted, neither with Cavendish nor from Cavendish. She merely bolted to Devonshire. To herself she succeeded in pretending that she was running away from Hector, from the inevitable recurrence of his amorousness; to Hector, that--hunting being almost over--Mollie\u0027s return to Clyst Fullerford furnished an excellent opportunity for her to pay the annual visit to her home. Hector grumbled, but gave in; and the two sisters traveled back together, Mollie chattering all the way down, Aliette silently speculating whether \"home\" would cure the mental and spiritual unease of which she now felt acutely conscious. But the unease persisted. Either \"home\" had changed its attitude toward her, or else she had changed her attitude toward \"home.\" The little wayside station with its one porter and its six milk-cans, the up-hill drive in the twilight, the first sight of the pilastered lodge, meant less than ever before. Her heart did not warm to anticipation at thought of the lit drawing-room, of her mother\u0027s hair white in the lamp-glow. Even when her father welcomed her in the antlered hall, she felt like a visitor. They seemed to her so old, so settled, so remote from the actuality of life, these two: Andrew (Aliette was of that age when children think of parents by their Christian names) with his veined hands, his tired eyes and patient mouth, his slow voice and stooping shoulders; Marie, thin, pleasantly querulous, all traces of beauty save the eyes, wallflower-brown as her daughter\u0027s own, dead in the lined face. The very house, long and low, browned by time, its mullioned windows dim with staring down the vale, seemed uncaring of her presence. Even her own room, the room always kept for Aliette, the white furniture bought for Aliette when she came back from boarding-school in France, could not give her the peace she sought. These things, and the things in the gardens, the pink-hearted primulas and the sheathed daffodils, seemed insentient of trouble, of the trouble in her mind. It had not been thus when she returned after marriage. Then the place had smiled its wanderer welcome. Now it was the wanderer who smiled; wanly; conscious of chill response; conscious--daily and hourly more conscious--of an issue she must face unaided. People, people she had known since cradle-days, came and went, busied as ever with the same pleasant trivial country round, keeping much to themselves, a little resentful of the war-rich who were creeping into Devonshire, ousting war-poor county-folk, transforming old places, building themselves new. \"Dear Aliette,\" said the people she had known since cradle-days, \"you\u0027re looking younger than ever.\" \"Dear people,\" she used to answer, \"how nice of you to say so.\" For outwardly she remained the same calm Fullerford who had married a Brunton. Nobody, not even Mollie, guessed the emotions that obsessed her. To them she was Hector Brunton\u0027s wife; not a girl of twenty-seven, dreaming herself in love, in love for the first time. Outwardly, she remained so calm. Her eyes were unruffled pools; her voice a mannered suavity. Even the Martins failed to irritate her. And Eva Martin would have irritated most sisters. The dignity of \"colonel\u0027s lady\" sat heavily on Eva\u0027s narrow shoulders. She resembled Mollie in vivacity, Aliette in complexion; but her eyes were their own cold blue, her hair its own fading gold, and her lips, which smiled often, but never in affection, two thin lines of anemic red across her undimpled cheeks. Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Martin\u0027s husband--a tall, gaunt soldier-man, uncompromising in speech, direct of dark eye, whom Aliette and Mollie would have liked well enough had he not been Eva\u0027s--spent a full ten days. They brought their children with them; and left them behind when they departed: two well-drilled little girls, who gave no trouble to anybody--and no enjoyment. So, for Aliette, Devon March warmed toward Devon April, bringing neither peace of mind nor solution of the issue; only the certainty that she who thought herself invulnerable had succumbed within thirty-six hours of making his acquaintance to the temporary attractions of a man. \"For, of course,\" she used to muse, \"it was only temporary; a moment\u0027s infatuation; the sort of thing I\u0027ve always heard about and never believed in. Curious, that I should still think so much about it! Am I still thinking about it--or about him? I am being funny. What\u0027s the matter with me? Love at first sight? The coup de foudre? But that\u0027s ludicrous; simply ludicrous. The sooner I get back to London and leave off brooding, the better.\" Nevertheless, as she ordered Caroline Staley to pack, Hector Brunton\u0027s wife realized herself desperately grateful that her husband--as announced by telegram--had been \"called out of town.\" Such wires, coinciding with vacation-times, usually signified that he had grown weary of entreating her fastidiousness! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316/90596.html","bookId":400,"book":{"id":400,"title":"The Love Story of Aliette Brunton","description":"简介： In our heart of hearts--which we in England take almost as much pains to hide from ourselves as from our fellow-creatures--most of us realize that life without love is a weariness, a conflict bereft of hope, a struggle for no victory....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM"}}
