{"id":33034,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII","content":"1 Jimmy\u0027s two-seater was suffering from one of its usual breakdowns. That red-haired young man, instructing his porter to put his bag into a first-class smoker, had no idea of the coil woven about his destiny. Ronnie he had not seen for some weeks; Julia\u0027s letter to his firm requesting that \"Mr. Wilberforce, Jr., should, if possible, come down and see me\" conveyed an invitation to stay the Friday night, but no hint of Mollie\u0027s presence at Daffadillies. Nevertheless, as he watched Victoria Station slide past the lowered windows, the solicitor\u0027s thoughts visualized a girl whose letters from Clyst Fullerford showed all too plainly that she meant to insist, despite her love for him, on Aliette\u0027s divorce preceding her own marriage. Jimmy had written that girl only a week since, begging her--\"for the absolutely last time of asking\"--to be reasonable. But the veiled threat brought only the inevitable reply, \"You mustn\u0027t ask me that. It wouldn\u0027t be fair to Alie.\" He had apologized for his veiled threat; but the reply to it still rankled. \"Really,\" thought the junior partner in Wilberforce, Wilberforce \u0026 Cartwright, \"it\u0027s getting a bit too thick. I\u0027ve told her over and over again that I don\u0027t care what her sister does. As far as I am concerned, she can go on living with Cavendish till the cows come home. But when it comes to that dear little idiot insisting that I should arrange my prospective sister-in-law\u0027s divorce before my own marriage--well, it\u0027s enough to try the temper of the lord chief!\" Though temperamentally incapable of a grand passion, the solicitor had long ceased to regard matrimony, in his own particular and individual case, as an unsentimental contract. He wanted the girl; and \"Dash it all,\" he decided, \"this thing\u0027s got to stop. If necessary, I\u0027ll have to run down to Devonshire. I can\u0027t wait much longer. She\u0027s asking too much of a chap. I can\u0027t settle this affair of her sister\u0027s. Nobody can settle it except H. B. And H. B.\u0027s as obstinate as a mule. Bit of a cad is H. B. Clever devil, though; I wish I had his income.\" Ruminating thus, James Wilberforce made Horsham Junction; changed trains; and arrived, still ruminating, at West Water. \"Here, you,\" he called to the solitary porter, \"is there a conveyance of any sort from Daffadillies?\" \"Yes, sir. There\u0027s a motor; and two ladies, sir.\" For a moment, Jimmy\u0027s eyes refused to recognize the two lone figures by the ticket-collector\u0027s gate of the little wayside platform: Aliette in a dove-gray coat and skirt, floppy straw shading her eyes; and Mollie, hatless, gloveless, almost too obviously unperturbed at his approach. Then, conquering surprise, he took off his hat; shook hands; and was whisked into the tonneau of a dusty car before he could collect his wits. \"Astonished, Jimmy?\" smiled the girl, still outwardly unperturbed, as Aliette, hardly restraining a sly chuckle of amusement, climbed up beside the driver. \"I certainly didn\u0027t expect----\" \"To find me here.\" Imperturbability gave place to diffidence. \"I didn\u0027t know you were coming down till an hour ago. Perhaps, if I had known, I shouldn\u0027t have come.\" \"That\u0027s a jolly remark to one\u0027s fiancé.\" \"I\u0027m not your fiancée.\" They were within two miles of Daffadillies before Jimmy ventured his next remark. \"Then you haven\u0027t changed your mind, dear?\" \"Certainly not. And, Jimmy--please behave yourself.\" The man--his slight caress eluded--fell into a sulky silence. \"Devilish awkward position,\" he decided--thought of his father\u0027s baronetcy, and of the social responsibilities entailed on a family solicitor, weighing heavily on his Philistine mind--\"women are the devil!\" He felt that he had been trapped; first, into foregathering with Aliette, a situation he had done his best to avoid since the scandal; secondly, into a scene with Mollie; and thirdly, into yet another discussion with that very resolute old lady, Julia Cavendish, about her son\u0027s matrimonial troubles. Nevertheless, the drive soothed him; and by the time they made the stone lodge and the eagle-crowned pillars of the great house, the prospect--scene or no scene--of twenty-four hours in Mollie\u0027s company outweighed all other considerations. Moreover, it seemed impossible to associate the foursquare magnificence and tree-girt terraces of Daffadillies with any form of scandal! \"And how is Mrs. Cavendish?\" he remembered to ask Aliette, as they alighted. \"Bucking up, one hears.\" \"She\u0027s ever so much better. She\u0027s in the garden to-day.\" 2 It is one of the tragedies of a long illness that those who live in daily contact with it fail to perceive the changes wrought in their loved one. James Wilberforce, as he made his way through the long hall and out of the French windows, down the stone steps on to the south lawns, was horrified at the first sight of his client. Only two days since he had read of her, somewhere or other, as \"well on her way to recovery.\" Nearing the shawled figure in the long chair under the cedar-tree, he knew the full inaccuracy of that bulletin. Julia Cavendish had shrunk to a merest vestige of the woman he remembered. The hand she extended to him seemed so frail that he hardly dared clasp it. The gray hair was nearly white; the sunken cheeks hectic; the bloodless lips tremulous. Only in her eyes shone the old dominance. \"Ronnie\u0027s coming down by the evening train,\" said the semblance of his old client. \"We\u0027re wondering if you\u0027ll stay the week-end.\" A servant whom Jimmy remembered to have seen at Bruton Street brought silver tea-things, a table, a cake-stand, and a hot-water-bottle for the invalid\u0027s feet. \"My daughter-in-law coddles me,\" she told him, as Aliette arranged the hot-water-bottle on the foot-rest of the chair and retucked an eiderdown round the thin knees. \"But I don\u0027t grumble. It\u0027s so splendid to feel one\u0027s getting well again.\" The pathos of that last remark brought tears very close to Jimmy\u0027s eyes. But once Julia had been carried into the house by nurse and Smithers, the young man in the town clothes forgot all about her. He wanted to be alone with Mollie--and the \"Brunton woman,\" confound her, refused to leave them alone. That tea-time, James Wilberforce learned yet another lesson, to wit, the exact meaning of our ancient saw, \"one man\u0027s meat is another man\u0027s poison.\" To him Aliette, the exquisite Aliette, was a bore, a nuisance, an interloper. He had never pretended to like Mollie\u0027s sister. Now positively he loathed her. Had it not been for the old lady\u0027s \"daughter-in-law\"--Daughter-in-law, forsooth. Why, damn it all, the position was a public disgrace! Irritably surveying both sisters, Jimmy speculated why on earth Ronald Cavendish should have jeopardized his career for any one so utterly insipid as Aliette. She was insipid, compared with Mollie. Except for her hair. And that, in the sunlight, was red. A rotten red! (Jimmy, like most red-haired people, could not bear the color in others.) As for the pale complexion and the carefully modulated, rather shy voice, he, personally, found them tiresome. \"If only she\u0027d go,\" he thought; and, at last, making the excuse that it was time for her to meet Ronnie\u0027s train, the \"Brunton woman,\" still chuckling, went. \"Isn\u0027t Alie a dear?\" said Alie\u0027s sister, following her with her eyes across the lawn. \"Isn\u0027t Hector a beast?\" And again James Wilberforce was troublesomely aware of his own selfishness. \"What did you think of Mrs. Cavendish?\" went on the girl after a pause. \"I\u0027ve only met her once before. She seems rather--rather thin, don\u0027t you think?\" \"She is rather thin,\" prevaricated Jimmy. \"But you do think she\u0027s going to get well, don\u0027t you?\" \"Let\u0027s hope so.\" For both the new-comers had seen, though neither of them could speak it, the truth about Julia; and in the light of that truth, their own troubles seemed petty. They didn\u0027t want even to speak of themselves. With their eyes, they said to one another: \"Not now. Not here. Not just under her windows.\" With their lips, till Ronnie and Aliette arrived, they made pretense. \"She\u0027ll get well,\" they said, sheering away, by mutual consent, from every personal topic. And this game of make-believe--which only good breeding enabled them to play--endured all through the dinner of which those four partook (Mrs. Sanderson and the hospital-nurse mealed alone) in the paneled room whose heavy gold-framed pictures looked down across vast spaces on the pale oval pool of the candle-lit dining table. But Ronnie, even taking part in the game, seemed distrait, self-absorbed. Dinner finished and the sisters gone, he poured himself a second glass of port; and, extracting a piece of carefully-clipped newsprint from his waistcoat-pocket, handed it across the table. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"of whom does this remind you?\" James Wilberforce took the proffered paper and scrutinized it carefully before replying: \"Well--it\u0027s a little like----\" \"Like Aliette.\" Ronnie\u0027s self-absorption passed in a flash. \"My dear chap, it\u0027s the very image of her. Look at those eyes, that mouth. I tell you I got the shock of my life when I opened the \u0027Evening News\u0027 on my way down to-night.\" \"Really--and who is the lady? Lucy Towers, eh! Screen-star, I suppose.\" \"Screen-star, you blithering idiot; she\u0027s just been arrested for murder.\" \"By Jove!\" Jimmy, whose wits had been wool-gathering, skimmed through the paragraph underneath the photo, and handed it back without further comment. His friend\u0027s excitement over the vague resemblance to Aliette--for that Ronnie was excited, quite uncontrollably excited, even the love-lorn solicitor could now see--appeared, to say the least of it, peculiar. \"Jimmy,\" went on the barrister, his eyes shining, \"I\u0027ll swear that woman\u0027s no murderess.\" \"You\u0027d better offer to defend her then.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t I like the chance! Look here,\"--another newspaper-cutting emerged from Ronnie\u0027s pocket,--\"that\u0027s the chap she\u0027s alleged to have murdered. Her husband, apparently. A nice-looking blackguard, too. As far as I can make out, there\u0027s another person under arrest for complicity. A man----\" \"Crime passionel, eh?\" \"Possibly.\" Ronnie folded up both the cuttings and put them carefully back into his pocket. \"And from the look of the late Mr. Towers, I can\u0027t say they\u0027re either of them much to blame.\" He relapsed into silence; and James Wilberforce realized, in a rare flash of psychological illumination, whither the chance remark had led his excited imagination. \"Talking of murder,\" he said suddenly. \"What would happen if I were to put a bullet into H. B.? There\u0027s been many a time when I\u0027ve wanted to. It makes me mad to feel that that man, or any man, has the power to deny a woman her freedom. It\u0027s sheer slavery--our marriage system.\" \"What the dickens is the matter with you to-night?\" James Wilberforce had risen, and placed a restraining hand on his friend\u0027s shoulder. \"I\u0027m bothered if I know. Seeing that photograph got on my nerves, I suppose. Funny things--nerves. I never knew what they were till--Hello, what the hell\u0027s that?\" A bell shrilled loud and long above their heads. \"The mater\u0027s bell. I hope to Christ there\u0027s nothing wrong.\" Ronnie sprang from his chair, and they waited a moment or so--as those in invalids\u0027 houses do wait on sudden summonses. But the bell did not ring again, and after a little while appeared Smithers with the news that \"Mrs. Cavendish would be very grateful if Mr. Wilberforce would go up and see her, alone, for a few minutes.\" 3 \"I hope you\u0027ve finished dinner?\" Julia Cavendish lay, like a queen in state, on the smoothed bed. To the eyes of James Wilberforce, puzzling their way here and there about the subdued light of the room, she looked almost herself again. \"You didn\u0027t mind my sending for you?\" \"Not in the very least. Isn\u0027t that what I came down for?\" The solicitor, unpleasantly self-conscious of his own physical bulk, sat down awkwardly beside the weak form on the bed. The invalid dismissed her nurse. She had intended to postpone Wilberforce\u0027s interview till the next morning, to work an hour or so. But her mind was in one of its peculiar turmoils. To any other listener, the tremor in her voice alone would have betrayed the importance, to her plans, of the forthcoming talk. \"I ought to have sent for your father, I suppose,\" she began. \"Have you brought the will with you?\" \"Yes. It\u0027s in my room. Shall I go and get it?\" \"No. There\u0027s a copy on my desk. Do you mind handing it to me?\" Obeying, James Wilberforce asked: \"Is there anything you want altered?\" \"Well--no--not exactly. But tell me, suppose I did want to make certain alterations, would it be necessary for you to draw up an entirely new document, or would this one do?\" \"If it was only a minor alteration,\" said Jimmy, quite unconscious of the thought at the back of his client\u0027s head, \"we could execute a codicil.\" \"A codicil.\" She played with the word. \"That\u0027s a kind of postscript, isn\u0027t it?\" \"More or less. But, of course, a codicil has to be properly witnessed.\" Wilberforce went on to explain the law of last wills and testaments at some length; and the invalid listened carefully. She appeared curiously inquisitive on the subject. and he humored her inquisitiveness till nurse, returning with medicine-glass and bottle, interrupted their conversation. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re tired,\" said nurse. \"I\u0027m sure you ought to let me settle you down for the night.\" \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t go to sleep for at least another hour. I\u0027ve a great deal to discuss.\" The nurse, realizing the patient in her stubbornest mood, left them alone again; and Julia, apparently satisfied on the subject of her will, began to talk of Ronnie. What did Mr. Wilberforce think of her son\u0027s chances at the criminal bar? What hopes were there, in Mr. Wilberforce\u0027s opinion, of Brunton\u0027s being forced to take action? Would publicity, for instance, the kind of publicity Belfield had used against Carrington, help? \"I shouldn\u0027t worry about that till you\u0027re better.\" Jimmy strove to be cheerful. \"But I do worry about it.\" \"Why? It\u0027s only a question of time. H.B.\u0027s bound to come round in the long run.\" \"I doubt that.\" Dropped lashes veiled the interest in Julia\u0027s eyes. \"Not without considerable pressure. He\u0027s a cruel man; and if he doesn\u0027t want to marry again, I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s very little hope. That\u0027s why----\" She grew thoughtful, silent. Then a new idea seemed to cross her mind. \"If he doesn\u0027t bring his divorce soon, he won\u0027t be able to bring one at all, will he?\" \"That depends.\" Wilberforce laughed. \"Divorce judges don\u0027t want to know too much in undefended cases.\" \"That\u0027s good.\" Julia, her mind now more or less at rest about its main problem, lay back among her pillows. So far, apprehensive lest the solicitor should discover her secret, she had gone subtly to work. But there was no subtlety about her next speech: \"Mr. Wilberforce, I suppose you know I\u0027m going to die?\" The directness of those words dumbed Jimmy. Only after the greatest difficulty could he manage the conventional prevarication: \"We all of us have to die some day.\" \"I\u0027m too tired for clichés.\" The woman on the bed smiled superciliously, whimsically almost. \"Death, in my case, is a very near certainty. That\u0027s a privileged communication.\" She smiled again. \"You won\u0027t tell my son or my daughter-in-law, will you?\" Not knowing how to reply, the man held his peace; and after a little while Julia Cavendish continued: \"When the end comes, it will be your father\u0027s duty as my executor to go through my papers. I\u0027ll telegraph for him if my mind is still clear. But he may not arrive in time. I\u0027d have sent for him to-night instead of for you, if I hadn\u0027t been afraid of,\" she hesitated, \"frightening people. I want you to give your father this message. Memorize it carefully, please. Tell him that there will be a letter for him--either for him or for you--I haven\u0027t yet made up my mind which. It depends on--on certain circumstances.\" With an effort, the frail form raised itself from the pillow and leaned forward. Even in the subdued light, James Wilberforce could see the pearls of sweat beading his client\u0027s forehead. Her hands showed blue-white on the sheets. Her blue eyes were an imploring question. \"The instructions in that letter will be a sacred trust. Will you give me your promise, your personal promise, that they shall be carried out?\" \"Of course, Mrs. Cavendish.\" Jimmy, moved to a great compassion, took one of the blue-white hands in his own strong clasp. \"You can rely upon me.\" \"Thank you. I can sleep now.\" He released her hand; and Julia subsided, eyes closed, among her pillows. For a moment, Jimmy was terrified. \"She\u0027s going to die,\" he thought. \"She\u0027s going to die to-night!\" But the eyes opened again; and it seemed to Jimmy that they read his unspoken thought. \"I\u0027m not going to die yet awhile,\" said Julia Cavendish. \"I\u0027m only sleepy. You might ring for nurse.\" Just as the nurse came in, she said to him, \"If I write that letter to you instead of to your father, it will be because I feel that you owe me a debt--a debt of gratitude. Scandal\u0027s a very small price to pay for--love, Mr. Wilberforce.\" 4 Once outside Julia\u0027s bedroom door, the solicitor took a silk handkerchief from the pocket of his dinner-jacket and pretended to blow his nose. He wanted, in his own elegant phraseology, \"to blub like anything.\" For the moment, his essentially legal mind was off its balance. \"I must control myself,\" he thought; \"I mustn\u0027t let those people downstairs see.\" And perhaps, if Ronnie and Aliette had been in the drawing-room, James Wilberforce might have succeeded in disciplining himself. But Mollie was alone; had been alone for a whole anxious hour. \"Jimmy\"--she rose from the sofa as he entered, and her eyes met his across the sudden brightness of the room--\"Jimmy, what\u0027s the matter? You look as if you\u0027d seen a ghost.\" \"Nothing\u0027s the matter,\" he said dully. \"You\u0027re sure?\" \"Quite. She\u0027s asleep.\" He came across the room to her, and they faced one another, all pretense wiped from their eyes. \"Tell me,\" said the girl at last. \"Tell me, is it quite hopeless? Does she--does she know?\" \"Yes. She knows.\" \"How terrible!\" Mollie\u0027s voice trembled. \"Jimmy, won\u0027t you tell me what she said? There might be some way in which I could help----\" \"There\u0027s only one way in which you can help me, Mollie.\" \"Don\u0027t! Please don\u0027t!\" Her hands protested. \"We mustn\u0027t think of ourselves. Not here. Not now.\" \"Why not!\" he said sullenly; and then, sinking heavily into a chair, \"I suppose you\u0027re right, dear. Life\u0027s a rotten mess----\" \"Poor Jimmy!\" Mollie\u0027s voice was very tender. \"My poor Jimmy!\" She put her hand on his head. He grasped it feverishly; and quite suddenly she knew that her James, her unemotional Philistine of a James, was crying. Thought expired like a candle in the mind of Mollie Fullerford. She was just conscious that Jimmy had risen from his chair--that his hand still grasped hers--that he was leading her through the open windows--over a lawn which felt damp to her thin-shod feet--under a moon-fretted tree--toward the dark of shrubberies. Somehow they were standing on a bridge; a little rustic bridge, mossy banks and moss-green water below. Her hands on the bridge-rail quivered like the hands of a \u0027cello player. She was quivering all over, quivering like a restive horse. Jimmy\u0027s arm was round her shoulders. He was speaking to her, hoarsely, hysterically, pleading with her; and she knew that the resolution which had held her so long firm against his importunities was weakening; weakening to every jerk of the Adam\u0027s apple in his throat. \"Mollie,\" he pleaded, \"I need you. I want you. I can\u0027t do without you. I can\u0027t wait any longer for you. You must marry me. You must, I tell you, you must.\" \"Jimmy,\" she stammered, \"Jimmy--please.\" \"You little idiot!\" Suddenly, she grew conscious of an immense anger in him. \"You dear, damned little idiot. What good do you think you\u0027re doing by refusing to marry me? You\u0027re not doing yourself any good. You\u0027re not doing me any good. You\u0027re not doing your sister any good.\" Words rushed out of him--faster--faster--always less coherent. \"Little fool. Selfish little fool We sha\u0027n\u0027t do anybody any good by waiting. Shall we? Answer me, Mollie! Shall we? Shall we do anybody any good?\" Words petered out. He could only strain her to him, crudely, fiercely. She felt her body weakening; felt the inhibitions of a year ebbing like water from, the channels of her mind. His lips sought hers. She yielded her lips to him--yielded herself beaten, to the fierceness of his arms. \"Little idiot, will you marry me?\" \"Yes, Jimmy.\" Triumphant, he released her; and in that moment his mind, still quivering from the verity of death, knew the verity of love. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316/90621.html","bookId":400,"book":{"id":400,"title":"The Love Story of Aliette Brunton","description":"简介： In our heart of hearts--which we in England take almost as much pains to hide from ourselves as from our fellow-creatures--most of us realize that life without love is a weariness, a conflict bereft of hope, a struggle for no victory....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM"}}
