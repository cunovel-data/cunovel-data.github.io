{"id":33028,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXI","content":"1 Ever since the contretemps at Patrick O\u0027Riordan\u0027s first-night--although his sense of family solidarity would have given much to admit his eldest son entirely in the right--Rear-Admiral Billy\u0027s sense of chivalry had been troubling him. From whatever angle he considered Hector\u0027s conduct, the cruelty of it was apparent. Moreover, he and Aliette had always been \"jolly good pals,\" and he hated \"parting brass-rags with the little woman\" who, all said and done, had been perfectly \"aboveboard.\" Nor was it only this \"aboveboardness\" on the part of his daughter-in-law which worried the admiral, but the knowledge, acquired quite fortuitously, and therefore relegated to the background of his memory, of his son\u0027s first infidelity to her. Always a religious man, though never a formal religionist, Rear-Admiral Billy worshiped a god of his own in his own way. But this god--a peculiar combination of the laws of cricket, navy discipline, family feeling, and sheer sentimentalism--found in Julia Cavendish\u0027s short, carefully worded note so insoluble a problem that within half an hour of its arrival the admiral sent his stable-boy on a bicycle to summon Adrian. Adrian mounted his cock-throppled nag and rode over to Moor Park. Said Adrian, who knew his father better than most sons: \"Naturally, sir, you won\u0027t go?\" Whereupon Adrian\u0027s father, after damning the episcopalian eyes for narrow-minded bigotry, dashed off a characteristic scrawl to say that, he \"would take pleasure in calling on Mrs. Cavendish on the following Monday, December 30, at 3:30 P.M.\" 2 It was exactly twenty-five years since \"the young Mrs. Cavendish,\" whose second novel had already laid the foundation-stone of her literary reputation, danced the old-fashioned waltz with Commander Brunton of her Majesty\u0027s China Squadron, newly returned from foreign service; but the pleasant bygone meeting came back clearly to Julia\u0027s mind as she rose from her sofa to welcome the bearded figure in the cutaway coat and sponge-bag trousers. This present meeting, both felt, was not going to be pleasant. On the contrary, it was going to be very awkward: its purpose presenting a social stile over which even their good breeding and the similarity of their castes must inevitably stumble. However, after a good deal of finesse on Julia\u0027s part, and various high-falutin compliments from her visitor, the admiral managed to stumble over it first, with a gallant: \"Mrs. Cavendish, I fancy I\u0027ve a pretty shrewd idea why you sent for me.\" \"It\u0027s nice of you to come to the point, admiral,\" said an equally gallant Julia; and then, taking opportunity by the forelock, \"Your son isn\u0027t behaving very well, is he?\" The father in Rear-Admiral Billy bristled. \"He\u0027s behaving within his rights. Your son hasn\u0027t behaved over-well, either.\" \"If you think that,\" the mother in Julia met brusquerie with brusquerie, \"why did you come and see me?\" The sailor in Rear-Admiral Billy cuddled his beard. \"Damned if I know why I came,\" he ejaculated. \"We can\u0027t do anything, either of us. Young people are the very deuce. I don\u0027t know what your son\u0027s like, but mine\u0027s as obstinate as a mule.\" \"You\u0027ve spoken to your son then?\" The novelist in Julia could not restrain a smile at her opponent\u0027s incapacity as a diplomat. \"Spoken to him? Of course I\u0027ve spoken to him. I\u0027ve done nothing else but speak to him.\" The sailor waxed confidential. \"But what\u0027s the use? Sons don\u0027t care a cuss about their fathers nowadays, nor about their mothers, either.\" \"I\u0027m sure mine does.\" \"Don\u0027t you believe it. None of \u0027em care about their parents. They call us \u0027Victorians\u0027--whatever that may mean. Ungrateful young puppies!\" Seeing her man mollified and disposed for confidences, Julia thought it best to let him \"return to his muttons\" in his own way. \"Nice little woman, Aliette,\" he said, apropos of nothing in particular. \"Not like these up-to-date hussies.\" \"A charming woman, I call her.\" \"Pity her kicking over the traces like this.\" \"You\u0027re sorry for her, then?\" \"Sorry for her? Of course I\u0027m sorry for her. I\u0027m sorry for any woman who makes a hash of things. But that\"--the disciplinarian, finding that the luxurious room and the pleasant creature on the sofa were both affecting his judgment, momentarily revolted--\"that don\u0027t alter facts. Marriage is marriage; and if your son runs away with my son\u0027s wife, you can\u0027t expect me to sympathize with either of \u0027em.\" \"But surely,\" Julia nearly purred, \"surely, my dear admiral--sympathy apart--your son doesn\u0027t intend----\" \"My dear lady,\"--the disciplinarian in Billy subsided--\"if I only knew what my son did intend, I might be able to help you. Whenever I try to talk to him about this business, he just shuts me up. What has your son got to say?\" And suddenly both of them began to laugh. Old age, the greatest tie in the world, made them for the moment peculiarly comrades. In the light of that comradeship, the young, even their own young, seemed less pathetic than to be envied. \"After all,\" they thought, \"it\u0027s all very sad; but it\u0027s worse for us than for them. They do get some fun out of these affairs. We don\u0027t. We only get the trouble; and we\u0027re too old for troubles.\" \"It isn\u0027t so much the scandal I mind,\" broke in the admiral, voicing their mutual idea; \"it\u0027s the damned upset of the whole business. I like a quiet life, you know. And that seems the one thing one simply can\u0027t get nowadays. Not for love nor money.\" For fully ten minutes they wandered away from the purpose in hand; discussing first their own era, then his profession, then her profession. \"Talking about books,\" said the admiral, \"give me Surtees.\" Truth to tell, the pair were rather enjoying themselves. Both belonged to the conversational school of an earlier day; and the flow of conversation was so satisfactory that--finally--it needed all Julia\u0027s strength of will, all her love for her son, to interpolate a crisp, \"We don\u0027t seem to have come to any decision. You will try and do something, won\u0027t you, admiral?\" The sailor interrupted himself sufficiently to manage a courteous, \"But, my dear lady, what can I do?\" \"Couldn\u0027t you talk to your son again? Couldn\u0027t you tell him that he\u0027s doing himself just as much harm as he\u0027s doing his wife?\" \"I have told him that. He says he doesn\u0027t care.\" \"And your other son? You have another son, haven\u0027t you, a clergyman?\" \"Oh, Adrian! Adrian\u0027s no good to us. Hector doesn\u0027t like him. Still,\"--after all, thought the admiral, one really ought to do something for a woman who lived in Bruton Street--\"I might get him to talk to Hector. I might even have another talk with Hector myself. But I\u0027m afraid it\u0027ll be quite useless. You see, Mrs. Cavendish, neither of my sons is a man of the world. That\u0027s the whole trouble. Alie isn\u0027t a woman of the world, either. Between men and women of the world, these situations don\u0027t occur. At least, they didn\u0027t in our day. Not often.\" \"I rather agree with you. Still, we have to take life as we find it.\" \"Exactly, exactly.\" The old man waved a hairy-backed hand. \"Nobody can say that I\u0027m old-fashioned. Divorce don\u0027t mean what it did in my young days. And besides--I\u0027m devilish fond of little Alie.\" \"Then I can rely upon your help?\" smiled Ronnie\u0027s mother. \"Absolutely, dear lady, absolutely.\" Ringing the bell for Kate to see her guest out, Julia Cavendish felt that she had at last found an ally; but the feeling was tinged with apprehension--reticence, she gathered, not being the admiral\u0027s strong point. 3 The admiral, making his way up Bruton Street, and along Berkeley Street toward his club, felt not only apprehensive but a trifle foolish. He had intended to be so very much on his dignity, so very much on his guard. Instead of which---- \"That\u0027s a damn clever woman,\" he said to himself, half in admiration, half in annoyance. \"An infernally clever woman. Wormed everything out of me, she did, just as if I\u0027d been an innocent snotty. Not that I ever met an innocent snotty. Confound it, I\u0027ve let myself in for something this trip. Have another talk with Hector! Made me promise that, she did.\" For frankly, the admiral funked the idea of having another talk with Hector. One never knew how to tackle Hector. \"Hector was such a damned unreasonable dumb-faced puppy!\" Cruising along Piccadilly, a mid-Victorian figure in the inevitable top-hat, with the inevitable white spats and the inevitable malacca cane, the admiral wondered whether he hadn\u0027t better get Simeon to tackle Hector, Adrian to tackle Hector, any one other than himself to tackle Hector--and so wondering, nearly rammed Hector\u0027s wife. The meeting, completely unexpected, entirely unavoidable, flurried the parties. But the sailor recovered his wits first; and Aliette, wavering between the impulse to pass on without bowing and the desire to smile and fly, knew herself cornered. Automatically she extended a hand, which her father-in-law squeezed in a firm clasp. \"Hello, my dear, whither away?\" he asked in his bluffest, heartiest manner. \"Nowhere in particular,\" answered Aliette shyly. \"Then you can walk me as far as the club.\" He took her arm and steered her masterfully along the pavement. It flashed across his mind, \"Bless her heart, she didn\u0027t want to recognize me. After all, she is a lady. She is one of us.\" \"Quaint--our meeting this afternoon,\" he volunteered aloud. \"Why this afternoon, Billy?\" Billy thought, guiltily, \"Perhaps I oughtn\u0027t to tell her,\" but the words were out of his mouth before thought could restrain them: \"Because I\u0027ve just come from Bruton Street.\" \"Bruton Street!\" She panicked at that; and tried to release her arm. \"Billy, I\u0027m sure you oughtn\u0027t to be seen walking with me.\" \"Stuff and nonsense, my dear! Stuff and nonsense!\" The old man, gripping her arm all the tighter, lowered his voice in conspiratorial sympathy. \"We ain\u0027t either of us criminals. Why shouldn\u0027t we be seen walking together? Besides, you and I\u0027ve got to have a little chat. Between you and me and the gatepost, Mrs. Cavendish has been asking my advice about things. Naturally, I had to tell her that I thought you\u0027d behaved pretty badly to Hector. Still,\" he patted her arm blatantly, \"that\u0027s no reason why Hector should behave badly to you, is it?\" And for a full five minutes--all the way from Devonshire House to the door of his club--chivalry had its way with Rear-Admiral Billy Brunton. He called her his \"dear Alie,\" he assured her that he\u0027d \"fix up the whole business,\" and that she was to \"rely upon him.\" He even managed to remember that she would like news of Miracle, and to inquire after Ponto. Listening, Aliette\u0027s heart warmed. Billy seemed so hopeful, so sympathetic. And she needed both hope and sympathy that afternoon: for latterly the tension between her and Ronnie had become almost unbearable, vitiating every hour, accentuating the loneliness of outlawry, till outlawry--in comparison with retrogression from their standard of happiness--appeared only a trivial sorrow. They arrived at the club. \"Tell you what you\u0027d better do,\" said Billy, \"you\u0027d better come in and drink a dish of tea. We\u0027ve got a ladies room at the Jag-and-Bottle these days. Too early for a cocktail, I\u0027m afraid. That\u0027s what you need. You\u0027re looking peaky.\" \"You\u0027re a dear, Billy,\" retorted Aliette, at last disengaging her arm. \"But you mustn\u0027t be a silly dear. You know perfectly well that you can\u0027t take me in there\"; and, cutting short the old man\u0027s protests, she bolted. 4 As he watched his daughter-in-law\u0027s fur-coated figure, the little shoes thereunder and the little hat a-top, recede from view up Piccadilly, chivalry still had its way with the sailor\u0027s sentimental soul. He had promised Julia Cavendish that he would tackle Hector--and, by jingo, he would tackle Hector. So, navy discipline and the laws of cricket alike allotting him the role of knight-errant, he drew a fat watch from his fob-pocket, consulted it, waved the malacca at a crawling taxi-driver, ordered him peremptorily: \"The Temple, Embankment entrance,\" and stepped aboard. The admiral anchored his taxi on the Embankment; strode through the gates, up Middle Temple Lane, and across King\u0027s Bench Walk. David Patterson, rising superciliously from the desk in the outer office of Brunton\u0027s chambers to inquire a stranger\u0027s business in vacation-time, encountered a curt, \"Tell my son that his father wants to see him,\" and disappeared within. \"What the devil does he want?\" Hector Brunton looked up from a letter he was studying; rose to his big feet, and straddled himself before the fire as his subdued clerk ushered his father through the doorway. \"This is an unexpected honor, sir,\" said Hector Brunton, K.C. The old man took off his top-hat, laid it among the papers on the desk; retained his malacca; and sat himself down pompously on an imitation mahogany chair. \"I\u0027ve come to talk to you about your wife,\" he began tactlessly; and without more ado plunged into a recital of his interview with Julia Cavendish and his chance meeting with Aliette, concluding: \"And if you take my advice, the best thing you can do is to start an action for divorce.\" \"As I told you before, sir,\" broke in the K.C., who had listened with restrained anger to his father\u0027s recital, \"I regret I cannot take that advice.\" The hands trembled behind his back. \"If I may say so, I consider that you\u0027ve put me entirely in the wrong by calling on Mrs. Cavendish.\" \"Oh, you do, do you?\" The old man, already sufficiently excited for one afternoon by his interview with the two ladies, felt his temper getting the better of him. \"You do, do you? Well, I don\u0027t. Mrs. Cavendish is a very delightful woman. A woman of the world.\" \"Is that all you came to tell me, sir?\" Hector\u0027s gray eyes smoldered. \"No, sir.\" The senior service beard bristled. \"I came to have this matter out once and for all. I came to tell you that you\u0027re not behaving like a gentleman.\" \"So you said before, sir. And I repeat the answer I gave you then. I see no reason why I should behave like a gentleman to a wife who hasn\u0027t behaved like a lady.\" \"Two blacks don\u0027t make a white, Hector.\" \"Possibly.\" The K.C. gathered up the tails of his morning-coat, and sat down, as though to terminate the discussion. But the old man, gloved hands glued on the handle of the malacca, stuck to his guns. \"Black\u0027s black and white\u0027s white,\" he rumbled dogmatically. \"You won\u0027t whitewash yourself by throwing mud at your wife. I didn\u0027t want to go and see the Cavendish woman. I\u0027ve always stood by my own and I always shall, so long as they stand by me. A man\u0027s first duty is to his family.\" \"Exactly my opinion, sir.\" \"Then why not act on it?\" The admiral fumed. \"D\u0027you think this business is doing me any good? D\u0027you think it\u0027s nice for Adrian, or Simeon, or Simeon\u0027s wife, to hear you talked about all over London----\" \"A man has his rights and I mean to assert mine. Let London talk if it likes.\" Aliette\u0027s husband spoke resolutely enough, yet he was conscious of a tremor in his voice. More and more now the thought of Aliette made him feel uncertain of himself. \"Let London talk!\" he repeated. \"My wife\u0027s made a fool of me. She and young Cavendish between them have dragged my name in the dirt. May I remind you, sir, that it\u0027s your name, too----\" \"All the more reason, then, to drag it out of the dirt. You won\u0027t do that by continuing to behave\"--the sailor\u0027s rage got the better of him--\"like a cad.\" At that, Hector Brunton forgot himself. His left hand thumped furiously on the desk. \"You tell me I\u0027m behaving like a cad, sir. What about this bastard Cavendish! What about the man who seduced my wife from her allegiance? He\u0027s the gentleman, I presume. Well--let the gentleman keep his strumpet----\" \"By God, Hector\"--the old man\u0027s eyes blazed,--\"you are a cad.\" The K.C. quaked at the red fury in his father\u0027s look. Weakly he tried to take refuge in silence; but the next words--words uttered almost of their own volition--stung him out of silence. \"Who are you to talk of keeping strumpets?\" \"Sir----\" \"Be quiet, sir. D\u0027you take me for a fool? D\u0027you think I don\u0027t know--d\u0027you think London doesn\u0027t know\"--the admiral\u0027s gall mastered him completely--\"about the strumpet you kept--kept without your wife\u0027s knowledge--kept in luxury for two years while other men were being killed----\" \"Really, sir, I protest----\" \"Protest then, and be damned to you. That\u0027s all you lawyers are fit for--protesting. Christ Almighty, you\u0027re worse than parsons. Talk of your rights, would you? Precious good care you took not to fight for other people\u0027s rights when you had a chance. Why, even Adrian----\" \"I fail to see, sir----\" Hector Brunton\u0027s face whitened, as the face of a man hit by a bullet whitens, at the taunt. \"You fail to see a good many things, sir.\" The admiral reached for his hat. \"Allow me to tell you one of them--that the man who permits his wife to live with somebody else without taking any steps to get rid of her, is a common or garden pimp.\" And the senior service, having said considerably more than it intended, marched out of the door. 5 Left alone, the K.C.\u0027s first feeling was relief. During the last weeks he had grown more and more resentful of his father\u0027s interference. And now he had finished with his father for good. Nevertheless, the taunt about his war-service rankled. Rankled, too, the admiral\u0027s last sentence, \"Get rid of her.\" \"God, if only I could get her back,\" thought Hector; and so thinking, remembered, as born orators will remember past speeches, his opening in the Ellerson case, his impassioned defense of woman\u0027s right to free citizenship. Then he remembered Renée. Renée had returned to England. How the devil had his father found out about Renée? Aliette, of course! Aliette must have told his father about Renée. Hector\u0027s gorge rose. He took a cigar from the box on his desk, lit it, and began to stride slowly up and down the book-lined room. Alternatively he visioned Renée, greedy, compliant, satisfying to nausea, and Aliette--Aliette the ultra-fastidious, infinitely unsatisfying. His marriage to a woman of Aliette\u0027s temperament had been a mistake. A mistake! Best cut one\u0027s loss--best get rid of her. Best comply with his father\u0027s wishes. And yet--how desirable, how infernally and eternally desirable was Aliette. The mood passed, leaving only rage in its wake. Curse Aliette! Curse his father! Curse the Cavendishes! How they would laugh if he yielded. They were all persecuting him, trying to break him. And \"They sha\u0027n\u0027t break me,\" he muttered; his teeth biting on the cigar till they met through the sodden leaf. \"They sha\u0027n\u0027t break me.\" Hector returned to his desk, and tried to absorb himself once more in study. But his mind refused its office. It seemed to him as though there were a ghost in the room, the ghost of his wife. \"I wonder if she ever thinks of me. I wonder if she ever sees me--as I see her,\" he thought. \"As I am seeing her now.\" 6 That afternoon, however, there was no picture of her legal owner in Aliette\u0027s mind. For months he had been receding further and further into the background of her thoughts, till now he had become more a menace than a man. It surprised her, as she walked slowly up Piccadilly after her meeting with Hector\u0027s father, to realize how little Hector had ever mattered, how much--always--Ronnie. Ronnie would be glad perhaps, to hear of her meeting with the admiral. \"Dear old Billy!\" she thought, \"dear old Billy!\" And thinking about him, a rare tinge of selfishness streaked her altruism. Suppose Billy succeeded! Suppose Hector really did set her free! How wonderful to be \"respectable\" again--to be done with the make-believe \"Mrs. Cavendish\" of Powolney Mansions, to be really and truly and legally Ronnie\u0027s! Always Ronnie had been splendid, loyalest of lovers; and yet--and yet--even in the shelter of a lover\u0027s arms one was conscious of outlawry, of the world\u0027s ostracism. What if, soon perhaps, the lover\u0027s arms were to be a husband\u0027s? But at that, illusions burst as bubbles in the breeze. Once more the tension of the past days strung Aliette\u0027s mind to misery. She was an outlaw, a woman apart--a woman ostracized--worse, a woman who had failed her mate. Memory, killing illusions, cast itself back, remembering and exaggerating her every little unloving word, her every little unloving gesture, blaming her for them. \"My fault,\" thought Aliette, \"mine and mine only. I have been selfish to him. Utterly selfish. I\u0027ve been--like I used to be with Hector.\" Thought threw up its line, horrified at the comparison; and, abruptly conscious of every-day life, Aliette found herself in Berkeley Square. Automatically she turned down Bruton Street. The mere name of the street--newly-painted in black block letters on gray stone--reminded her again of Billy, of Billy\u0027s visit to Julia Cavendish. At whose instigation, his own or hers, had the admiral visited Ronnie\u0027s mother? Hope rose again; but now, with hope, mingled despair. Had she so far failed Ronnie as to have forfeited his confidence? Still walking automatically, Aliette found herself facing the mahogany door of Julia\u0027s house, and rang the bell. \"Yes,\" said Kate, \"Mrs. Cavendish was at home, and alone. Would Mrs. Ronnie\" (it was an understood thing in the basement of Bruton Street that Aliette should be referred to as \"Mrs. Ronnie\") \"like some tea?\" \"Thank you, Kate. That would be very nice.\" Aliette, unannounced, went slowly up the print-hung staircase; tapped on the drawing-room door; heard a faint \"Come in\"; and turned the handle. Ronnie\u0027s mother lay on the sofa. She looked white, exhausted; but her lips framed themselves to a smile. \"I may come in, mayn\u0027t I?\" Aliette\u0027s misery increased at the sight of her hostess\u0027s pallor. \"Kate\u0027s promised to bring me some tea. I\u0027m not disturbing you, am I?\" \"My dear, you\u0027re always welcome. Come and sit here by me.\" Julia made place on the sofa, and Aliette sat down. \"I wonder why she came this afternoon,\" mused the elder woman. \"I wonder if, by any chance, she can have found out. Awkward, if she has found it. Very awkward.\" But there was no tremor of guilt in her, \"How\u0027s Ronnie?\" \"Quite well, thank you.\" \"And you?\" \"Oh, I\u0027m all right. A little worried, that\u0027s all.\" \"Worried? What about?\" \"Oh, various things.\" Kate, bringing the tea, interrupted their conversation. Watching Aliette as she drank, Julia saw that the hands, usually so steady, trembled. \"Can\u0027t you tell me about the worries?\" she said kindly. \"There\u0027s nothing--really.\" Aliette\u0027s voice trembled as her hands. \"Only I--I--met Hector\u0027s father just now. And somehow--it rather made me realize--my position.\" \"Did he tell you,\" Julia\u0027s courage fought with her fatigue, \"that he\u0027d been to see me?\" \"He did.\" Aliette put down her tea-cup on the little mahogany stand. \"May I know--did you send for him?\" \"Yes. I sent for him.\" A smile. \"You mustn\u0027t be angry with me.\" \"But why--why wasn\u0027t I told about it?\" \"Then you are angry?\" Another smile. \"Not angry. Only a little hurt.\" \"Hurt! Why? It was done in your interests.\" The old eyes looked into the young. \"We thought that, if we consulted you, you mightn\u0027t allow it.\" \"We! Then Ronnie\"--the young eyes looked into the old--\"Ronnie knew. And he never told me--he never told me.\" \"It wasn\u0027t Ronnie\u0027s fault.\" Julia laid a hand on Aliette\u0027s shoulder. At the touch, it seemed to the younger woman as though all the misery of the past days stabbed to one dagger-point of pain. Jealousy wrenched at her tongue. She wanted to cry out, \"Oh, you\u0027re cruel, cruel. Why can\u0027t you tell me the truth, the truth?\" But the pain stabbed her dumb; stabbed and stabbed till her mind was one unbearable tension of self-torture. Ronnie no longer loved her. Ronnie only wanted to do his duty by her. And it was her own fault, her very own, ownest fault, for not having loved him enough. And then, suddenly, the tension snapped--leaving her weak, defenseless. \"You\u0027re so good--so much too good to me,\" faltered Aliette. \"So infinitely better than I deserve. If only--if only I hadn\u0027t brought all this trouble into your life.\" \"Nonsense, child,\" said Julia bruskly--for, despite her own weariness, she recognized hysterics in the other\u0027s voice. \"It isn\u0027t nonsense. I\u0027ve brought you only troubles--troubles.\" \"Don\u0027t be foolish. The troubles, as you call them, are nothing. Nothing at all in comparison with Ronnie\u0027s happiness.\" \"Happiness!\" Now hysteria was blatant in the other\u0027s every word. \"Happiness! How can I make him happy? I can\u0027t--can\u0027t even make a home for him. All I\u0027ve done is to--to let him keep me--in a--in a boarding-house.\" \"You\u0027re overtired, child. Overwrought. Otherwise you wouldn\u0027t talk like that.\" The brusquerie had given place to a quiet understanding tenderness; the hand tightened on Aliette\u0027s shoulder. \"I tell you, you have brought happiness into our lives. Into Ronnie\u0027s life and into mine. Nothing that either of us could ever do----\" \"But I\u0027m not worth it. I\u0027m not worth it.\" Tear-choked, Aliette seized Julia\u0027s hand and pressed it to her lips. \"I\u0027ve been rotten--rotten to your son. That\u0027s why he didn\u0027t tell me about Billy.\" \"Rubbish!\" Resolutely the elder woman withdrew her hand. \"Utter rubbish! It was entirely my fault that you weren\u0027t told about the admiral.\" \"Your fault?\" A ray of hope illumined the brown eyes. \"Yes. Ronnie wanted you to know. But I overpersuaded him.\" Silently the blue eyes held the brown, till--gradually--self-control came back to Aliette; till--gradually--she realized the tension gone from her brain. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she began. \"I don\u0027t often make scenes.\" \"My dear\"--exhausted, Julia lay back on the cushions--\"you needn\u0027t apologize. No one understands better than I that life isn\u0027t altogether easy for you. But don\u0027t lose your pluck. Believe me, it\u0027ll all come out right now that we have the admiral on our side.\" \"Billy hasn\u0027t much influence over Hector.\" There was no fear, only certainty in the statement. \"Hector\u0027s so vain. It\u0027s his vanity, only his vanity that prevents him from giving me my freedom.\" \"One day he\u0027ll be forced to give you your freedom. But,\" of a sudden, anxiety crept into Julia\u0027s tired voice, \"if he doesn\u0027t? What if he doesn\u0027t give you your freedom, child?\" \"Even if he doesn\u0027t,\"--proudly, all the misery of the past days forgotten, Aliette took up the unspoken challenge--\"even if he never does,\"--proudly, all her being resuffused with happy courage, she rose to her feet--\"it will make no difference.
