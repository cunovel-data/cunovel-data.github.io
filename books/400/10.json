{"id":33016,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX","content":"1 By that strange perversity which is peculiar to loving womanhood, Aliette\u0027s first thoughts--as the taxi rattled her away from Jermyn Street--were for her husband. For the second time in three years her mood relented. \"Poor Hector!\" she thought. \"He\u0027ll be home when I get back. It isn\u0027t much of a home for him--ours.\" Yet, even relenting, she knew that she could never forgive. The physical Hector was dead, killed by her knowledge of his infidelities--as dead to her as the physical Ronnie was alive. Then she forgot Hector, remembered only Ronnie. Her memory thrilled to his caresses. She began to yearn for him with a bodily yearning so acute that--had he been beside her in the taxi--she would have thrown her arms round his neck. Her mind whirled. This way. That way. She, Aliette Brunton, who had always thought \"that sort of thing\" the prerogative of shop-girls and chorus-ladies, was yearning, physically, for a man. It was all wrong. She should never have gone to his rooms. They must part. She would never be parted from him. He ought never to have made love to her. She would have died if he had not made love to her! She tried to blame herself for her weakness; she tried to think: \"I made no struggle. I yielded everything. I virtually threw myself at his head. I should have been strong. I should have denied him my hands, my lips.\" But her heart refused to be blamed; her heart said: \"He loves you. You love him. Nothing else matters.\" The taxi swung into Bayswater Road; and instinctively Aliette opened her vanity-bag. Glancing at her face in the mirrored lid, she remembered Hector again. Hector mustn\u0027t see her as Ronnie had seen her. Hector mustn\u0027t find out! Once more, she felt abased. Once more her fastidiousness revolted--this time from concealment. The commonplace impulse--to confess--appeared, disappeared. What was there to confess? Nothing! Nevertheless, paying her driver, mounting the pillared door-step, ringing as she let herself into the square tessellated hall, Aliette felt guilty. In thought, if not in act, she was little better than the husband whom Lennard, appearing from his lower regions, announced to be in the library. Caroline Staley joined Lennard in the hall. Aliette handed her gloves, her bag and parasol to the maid; asked Lennard the time; heard it was a quarter past seven; hesitated the fraction of a second; and pushed open the library door. Hector sat in his big leather armchair by the bow-window--the \"Evening Standard\" on his knees, and a glass of whisky and water at his elbow. His gray eyes lit pleasurably at sight of her. As he came across the room with a smiled \"My dear, how well you\u0027re looking,\" Aliette realized with the shock of a sudden revelation the cruelty latent in those thin lips. (She was looking well, thought Hector; her very best. This evening, that subtle incomprehensible process, process alike mental and physical, which he had divined at work in her for so long, seemed to have attained its completion. Her very complexion showed it.) \"Am I?\" she answered. He gave her the cheek-kiss of connubial compromise; and she schooled herself not to shudder. \"This is the price I must pay,\" she thought, \"for those other kisses.\" The front-door bell rang; and, a minute afterwards, Mollie rustled in. \"Hello, Hector,\" said Mollie. \"So you\u0027ve got back.\" The girl\u0027s eyes were all luminous, subtly afire with happiness. Kissing Aliette, she whispered, \"I must talk to you.\" To Brunton, watching the sisters go arm in arm through the door, came a sharp pang of sex-consciousness. As Aliette, so Mollie: from each there radiated that same incomprehensible aura of physical and mental completion. The aura excited Brunton, stimulated him, roused his imagination almost to mania. All the way home in the car--and usually the car distracted him--he had been thinking of his wife, goading his mind with the mirage of the past. Now the prongs of the goad penetrated through the mind to the very flesh. He poured himself another drink, and stood for a long while in contemplation of a photograph on his desk; a photograph of Aliette, taken just before they became engaged. He remembered how then, as always, her fastidiousness had lured him; how then, as now, he had ached to conquer her fastidiousness, to make her desires one with his own. And always, from the very outset to this very day, he had failed. Against the refinement in her, even when she yielded, his will to sex-mastery beat in vain; till finally there came the break. The break, as Hector saw it, had been of her making. The things he most desired of her, the unfastidious intimacies, she either could not or would not endure. Those intimacies she had driven him elsewhere to seek. And he had sought them for three years; sought them, he now realized, without assuaging his desire. Dressing for dinner, he heard--from the room she had barred against him--his wife\u0027s voice. His wife and her sister were talking, talking. The incomprehensible talk maddened Hector, even as the incomprehensible physical aura of them had maddened him. Surely--surely it was high time to put an end to this--this nonsensical chastity. 2 Her sister\u0027s dressing-hour confidences seemed to Aliette the final complication. Mollie had met James Wilberforce, by accident, in Bond Street. Although too late for tea, he had insisted on her eating an ice at Rumpelmayer\u0027s. At Rumpelmayer\u0027s they ran into the admiral and Hermione. The admiral had spoken of his meeting with Alie. \"Where did you have tea?\" asked the girl. \"Never mind about my tea,\" retorted her sister. \"Tell me your news.\" Whereupon Mollie, not in the least hesitantly, told it. Jimmy had asked her to marry him! That is to say, he had spoken about marriage in such a way as to leave no doubt about his intention to propose. That was one of the admirable things about Jimmy. He never beat around the bush. She, of course, had \"choked him off.\" Jimmy must be taught that these things couldn\u0027t be fixed up over an ice in a tea-shop. \"Still,\" concluded the modern young, \"I\u0027m very fond of James. The chances are that I shall marry him in the autumn.\" \"And James Wilberforce,\" thought Aliette, as she went down to dinner, \"is just the person whose wife\u0027s family must be sans reproche!\" Dinner completed her mental bouleversement. Hector--she divined even before they sat down--was in a difficult mood. Hector insisted on champagne, insisted on their sharing it. He grew boisterous on the first glass. \"They would have a cheery evening,\" said Hector. \"They would get the car round after dinner, and drive to Roehampton.\" But on Aliette\u0027s suggesting that he and Mollie should go alone, he dropped both the scheme and his pose of boisterousness. Catching the look in his eyes, she began to be frightened. Only twice before--once after her first discovery of his infidelities, and once a year later--had Aliette seen that particular look in Hector\u0027s eyes. It betokened contest. Not the casual entreaties of recent months, but contest--contest almost physical! Formerly, though resenting the indignity of such a contest, she had never dreaded it. But to-night--to-night was different. When Lennard brought in the port, Hector refused to be left alone. They stayed with him while he drank two glasses; and again, watching him, Aliette\u0027s mood relented. The look in his eyes had grown soft, almost pleading. \"Poor old Hector,\" she thought; \"so many women could have given him all that he requires from a wife. Only I--I can\u0027t. I\u0027m Ronnie\u0027s--Ronnie\u0027s.\" Once more her mind whirled. This way. That way. Guilt, fear, love, uncertainty drove the wheels of her mind. Yet both mind and body possessed one certainty: that the physical Hector had died three years since. 3 It was late, nearly midnight; but Mollie still sat strumming on the piano in the big balconied drawing-room. Ever since dinner began the girl had been conscious of domestic tension. She could see, over the shining instrument, that neither husband nor wife listened to the music. They sat, either side the fireplace, avoiding speech, avoiding each other\u0027s eyes. Occasionally, when he thought himself unobserved, Hector would glance at Alie. Mollie knew, of course, that Alie didn\u0027t get on very well with Hector. On more than one of her visits to them there had been such periods of tension. But this--to the girl\u0027s intuition--seemed far more serious, far nearer definite crisis than anything before. Somehow the situation frightened her; somehow she felt averse to leaving Alie alone with Hector. All the same, one couldn\u0027t go on playing ragtimes till dawn. Mollie fired a final rafale on the bass keys, and closed the piano. \"I\u0027m going to bed,\" she announced. \"You too, Alie?\" \"Not just yet.\" Aliette kissed her sister good night. During the last two hours her relenting mood had almost evaporated under the fire of Hector\u0027s covert glances. Her mind no longer whirled. She knew now--definitely--that contest between them was unavoidable; and, though she still dreaded it, her courage refused to postpone the ordeal. The door closed behind Mollie; and, after a moment\u0027s hesitancy, Hector leaned forward from his chair. Aliette saw that there were pearls of sweat on his forehead. His hands gripped the blue grapes of the cretonne chair-cover as though he would squeeze them dry. \"I\u0027m glad she\u0027s gone to bed,\" he said hoarsely. \"Are you? Why?\" \"Because it\u0027s time that you and I had things out with one another.\" \"What things?\" Her voice sounded a little shy, but she no longer averted her eyes. They met his--brown cold and resolute, against gray kindling to passion. \"Everything. Aliette,\" he began to plead with her, \"we can\u0027t go on like this for ever.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because the whole position\u0027s intolerable. Either you\u0027re my wife, or you\u0027re not. I--I can\u0027t stand this sort of life.\" \"What sort of life?\" \"You know perfectly well what I mean. Aliette,\" he pleaded again, \"can\u0027t we make a fresh start--to-night?\" She felt her whole heart turning icy to him as she answered: \"We threshed that matter out a very long time ago. I can see no use in referring to it again.\" \"Possibly you can\u0027t.\" Hector rose. Her very aloofness urged him, despite better judgment, to immediate mastery. \"But you\u0027re not the only one to be considered. As your husband, I have certain rights.\" \"If you have, I shouldn\u0027t advise you to try and enforce them.\" The words sounded calm enough; but there was no calm in Aliette\u0027s heart. Suddenly she grew conscious that the sense of rectitude which had sustained her for three years sustained her no longer. In thought she had descended to her husband\u0027s level. Her cheeks flushed. \"Why shouldn\u0027t I enforce them?\" The flush did not escape his eye. Perhaps, after all, she was no different from other women, from the women who liked one to be forceful. He made a movement towards her. \"Why shouldn\u0027t I enforce them?\" he repeated. \"Because you have no rights.\" Even his blurred judgment knew better than to touch her. \"Because you forfeited them--three years ago.\" \"That old affair,\" he muttered sullenly; and drew away from where she sat. Then, excusing himself, \"Renée\u0027s in Australia. She\u0027s been in Australia two years. I paid her passage----\" Proudly, coldly, Aliette answered him back: \"I hope you do not discuss your wife with your mistresses in the same way that you discuss your mistresses with your wife.\" The cold pride weakened him. \"You\u0027re very harsh. I made a mistake--three years ago. I admitted it at the time. I admit it once more. I\u0027ve made--other mistakes. But that\u0027s all over. You\u0027re a woman, a well-bred woman. You can\u0027t understand these things.\" Three days since she would not have understood; now, understanding a little, she relented again. \"Hector--I\u0027m very sorry. But it\u0027s--it\u0027s impossible.\" He came toward her again; bent down, and tried to take her hand. She drew it away from him. The overwhelming physical hunger of his eyes worried her. His feet, on the white rug, showed suddenly enormous, grotesque--grotesque as his affection. \"Why is it impossible?\" She thought how often she had asked herself that same question; knew that--in Ronnie\u0027s arms--she had at last found the answer; knew that she must lie. And she hated lying. Yet more than lying she hated the knowledge that her body, which had lain in Ronnie\u0027s arms, should be cause of that overwhelming hunger in Hector\u0027s eyes. She said quietly, \"Must we go over all this old ground again?\" And since he did not answer: \"It does no good. I don\u0027t want to hurt you more than I can help. Won\u0027t you just leave things as they are? Won\u0027t you believe me when I tell you that it\u0027s just--impossible?\" His legal mind, suddenly active, caught at the pleading note in her voice; fastened on it. \"You\u0027re very solicitous, apparently, about my feelings?\" For a second, wondering if he could suspect, she grew fearful. Then, putting away fear, she rose and faced him. The flush had gone from her cheeks; her eyes--aloof, impersonal--told him the utter hopelessness of his cause. And with that knowledge came suspicion--a suspicion formless as the first shadow-haze of storm in a brazen sky. \"I don\u0027t wish to hurt you,\" she reiterated. \"But the thing you ask is out of the question; and will always be out of the question. Even the discussion of it offends me.\" He took a step towards her; but she did not recoil. \"Aliette--do you realize the meaning of what you\u0027ve just said?\" \"Perfectly.\" Her eyes met his, beat them down. \"And what do you expect me to do under the circumstances?\" Again suspicion came to him; and with suspicion, anger at his own impotence. \"You\u0027re not a child. You know perfectly well what happens to a man whose wife refuses to live with him. I\u0027ve never pretended to be a saint: I\u0027ve left that to you.\" \"Hector!\" Temper clenched her fingers. Her whole fastidiousness revolted against the man, against the topic he would not relinquish. \"I\u0027m sorry if you\u0027re shocked\"--all his cruelty wanted to shock her, to see her fastidiousness in degradation--\"but I\u0027m trying to tell you the truth--just for a change. If you persist in your saintliness, there\u0027s only one course open to me. Another Renée! A man can\u0027t live without a woman. It isn\u0027t fair to his nature. It isn\u0027t healthy.\" \"Healthy!\" she burst out. \"Yes. Healthy. Does that upset you?\" Her eyes blazed as she answered: \"How dare you talk to me like that? How dare you? Healthy! I suppose that was your idea when you married me. You took me--medicinally.\" \"Aliette!\" Her fury cowed the cruelty in him. \"I married you because I loved you. I love you still.\" \"Love!\" Her cheeks kindled. Caution was ripped loose from her as a sail is ripped loose by the wind. The shreds of it flapped against her mind, infuriating her. That this man who might have been father of her children should cloak his lusts with that divine word, seemed the ultimate defilement. \"Love!\" Her breasts heaved. \"Don\u0027t talk to me of love. Talk of your rights, of your health, if you like; but spare me the degradation of what it pleases you to call your love.\" At that, definitely, the lawyer in Brunton suspected. Black thoughts drove and drove, thunder-cloud-like, across the sky of his mind; and through the rifts in those thunder-clouds his mind saw two visions--his wife, infernally desirable, infernally distant from the reach of his desires, and a woman to be probed, a hostile witness for cross-examination. \"You speak as though you were an authority on the subject,\" he sneered; and, as she deigned no answer, \"a saintly authority.\" \"You\u0027re insolent.\" The last shred of her caution parted. \"Insolent.\" \"Perhaps\"--his voice dropped two full tones--\"I have the right to be insolent.\" \"Explain yourself, please.\" He came so close to her that she could see every pore in the skin of his face. \"I should hardly have thought an explanation necessary. I said, \u0027Perhaps I have the right to be insolent.\u0027 It is for you to explain why\"--his lips worked--\"you regard \u0027what I am pleased to call my love for you\u0027 as a degradation.\" \"And if I refuse to explain?\" \"There is only one conclusion to be drawn.\" \"And that is?\" she dared him. Abruptly, Brunton the lawyer became Brunton the husband. He no longer wanted to cross-examine; he wanted to possess--to possess this woman. Why should he not possess her? She was as much his as the furniture in his home, the books in his chambers. By law and by religion, she owed him her body. He had always been chivalrous to her; he had always tried to fall in with her whimsies, to be kind. She had never been kind. All she had tried to do was to hurt him. \"And that conclusion is?\" she flung at him. God! How much she could hurt him. God! How he wished to spare himself. He wanted her so; his whole body ached for her little hands, for her lips, for the touch of her hair. Why should she thus goad him? Even if--even if she had cared--virtuous women did care sometimes, platonically of course--for somebody else, he could forgive her. He did not want, even, to forgive. He only wanted to know nothing. He only wanted her to be kind to him, to let him love her--in his own way. Without all this--all this fuss. But her eyes refused him kindness; her lips demanded their answer. She maddened him with her rigid lips, with her blank unfriendly scrutiny. \"Your conclusion, please, Hector?\" \"Since you insist,\" the words seemed torn from the man\u0027s throat, \"the conclusion I draw is that--you\u0027re in love with somebody else.\" He had expected indignation, furious abuse, furious denial; anything but the deadly calmness with which she answered: \"And supposing there were somebody else? What right would you have to object?\" Aliette saw Hector recoil as though she had struck him; saw rage, incredulity, fear, apprehension, chase in scarlet chaos across his face. His thin lips writhed--as though in torment. But she could feel no pity for his torment. In her eyes, he was the beast, the defiling beast: defeated, he yet stood, shifty on those great feet of his, between her and happiness, between her and her chance of motherhood, between her and--Ronnie. \"Well,\" she shot at him, \"what right would you have to object?\" \"I should have the right,\" he stammered, \"the right that any husband possesses. But you\u0027re not serious. For God\u0027s sake, tell me you\u0027re not serious. I haven\u0027t been such a bad husband to you. I haven\u0027t deserved this----\" Suddenly she remembered Ronnie\u0027s words: \"Unless he lets you divorce him. Why not? It\u0027s done every day.\" Suddenly she remembered Hector\u0027s own words, the speech he had insisted she should read after the Ellerson case. \"You\u0027re not serious,\" he challenged. \"I\u0027m perfectly serious. Please answer my question. And before you answer it, let me remind you of something you said in public not more than a fortnight ago. You said: \u0027A woman on marriage does not become her husband\u0027s property.\u0027 I want to know if you still abide by that question.\" \"And I\"--rage mastered the apprehension in him--\"I want to know, definitely, if there is anybody else.\" Her lips pursed to silence. She could almost see Ronnie--and her silence was all for him. For herself she had no fear, only the violent instinct to be free, to be free at any cost, from Hector Brunton. \"Answer me!\" He almost shouted at her. Quietly, she answered, \"There is nobody else--in the way you mean.\" \"Will you swear?\" \"You have my word. If that\u0027s not enough for you----\" The unfinished sentence tortured him. He saw himself alive, tormented; her as a statue of fate, unmoving, cold by his cold fireside. If only she would make some movement--not stand there like a statue: her lips rigid, her hands taut, every line of her body tense under the frozen draperies. \"I don\u0027t doubt your word,\" he said sullenly. \"Then answer my question. Do you regard me as your property or not? If I asked you for my freedom, would you give it to me?\" \"You mean--let you divorce me?\" For a moment, aware of hypocrisy, Aliette hesitated. Then she said, \"Yes.\" \"On what grounds?\" \"Your infidelities.\" \"My infidelities!\" He laughed, his legal mind seeing the whole strength of his position. \"You have no proof of them. And even if you had, infidelity by itself is no ground for divorce. Besides\"--his cruelty could not forbear the blow--\"you\u0027ve condoned them.\" \"Condoned them! I?\" \"Yes. You. By not leaving my house. By continuing to live with me.\" \"That\u0027s untrue. I\u0027ve never lived with you, since--since I found out.\" \"You\u0027ll never make the world believe that.\" \"What do I care about the world?\" \"Aliette\"--for the last time he forced himself to plead with her,--\"think of my position, our position. Even if it were legally possible, you wouldn\u0027t ask me----\" He continued to plead till he felt utterly worn out, utterly beaten; till it seemed to him that he had been arguing with her--arguing uselessly--for hours. And all the time he argued, one thought nagged at him: \"There is somebody else. There must be somebody else. I must find out who he is.\" \"Then you refuse,\" she was saying. \"You refuse me my freedom. You go back on your own words.\" She, too, felt worn out. She could not even hate the man, because she had no right to hate him. At least--Mollie\u0027s words about James Wilberforce came into her weary mind--Hector had not beaten around the bush. He had been straight-forward enough; whereas she--she was not being straight-forward, was not playing the game. But the instinct to be free did not abate its violence. \"Very well\"--the cross-examiner in Brunton urged him to the playing of his last card,--\"I won\u0027t go back on my words. I\u0027ll admit the justice of everything you\u0027ve said. You shall have your freedom.\" Her eyes lit; and his suspicion became certainty. \"I\u0027ll arrange everything. There need be very little scandal; only the usual fake--a suit for restitution of your conjugal rights. You\u0027ll get an order of the court, an order for me to return to you. You needn\u0027t worry, I sha\u0027n\u0027t comply with it. After that----\" He broke off, watching her. Her face had softened, renewed its coloring. Yet she was nervous. She fidgeted ever so slightly, first on one white-shod foot, than on the other. \"But before I consent, there\u0027s one condition I must make; one question I must ask you.\" His voice grew stern, became the voice of the K.C. \"Before I take any steps in this matter, I must have your assurance, your definite assurance, that you are not asking for your freedom with a view--with a view\"--he hesitated--\"to marrying any one else.\" The blood ebbed from Aliette\u0027s cheeks: it seemed to her that her heart had stopped beating. This was the test! One downright lie--and she might win to freedom. That issue she saw clearly. But she saw another issue--the issue between herself and Ronnie. Even though Ronnie himself had suggested that she should divorce Hector, his suggestion--she knew--had implied telling Hector the truth. Surely Ronnie would be the first to reject freedom won at such a price. And, \"I\u0027ve got to play the game,\" cried the soul of Aliette; \"otherwise, even my love for Ronnie becomes a degradation.\" Yet, still, instinct cried in her for freedom. The decisive seconds lengthened; lengthened; stretched, taut as piano-wire, into the eternities. The scene imprinted itself, sharper than sharpest snapshot, on unfading memory. Always, burnt into memory, would remain Hector, his sandy hair awry, his thin lips parted under the bulbous nose, his jowl set; would remain herself, torture-pale on the rack of indetermination; would remain the light white room, blazing with electrics, the stripes of its wall-paper upright as prison bars. No freedom from that prison--save at the price of truth! But at last, truth spoke. \"I cannot give you that assurance, Hector,\" said Hector\u0027s wife. About her, the snapshotted scene trembled, shivered and broke to whirling fragments. She was conscious of Hector\u0027s hands, itching to take her by the throat, of Hector\u0027s feet, of the red fury in Hector\u0027s eyes. His hands itched to strike her. If he struck, she would strike back--madly, through those whirling fragments. But Brunton could not strike; he could not even speak. The insanity of balked desire dumbed his mouth as it numbed his limbs. Nature, fighting like a wild beast, wrenched at the cage of his self-control. He could hear nature wrenching ape-like at his ribs, howling to him: \"Kill! Kill both! Kill both the man and the woman!\" The blood-lust and the sex-lust were knives in his loins. \"You!\" he stammered. \"You, you----\" Then his hands ceased their itching, and the red in his eyes flickered out, smoldering to gray. She heard his great feet go creaking across the room, creaking through the doorway, creaking up the staircase. She heard the slam of an upstairs door. She heard herself whisper to the wide-eyed distraught woman who peered out from the mirror over the mantelpiece: \"That leaves only one way--only one way to freedom.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316/90603.html","bookId":400,"book":{"id":400,"title":"The Love Story of Aliette Brunton","description":"简介： In our heart of hearts--which we in England take almost as much pains to hide from ourselves as from our fellow-creatures--most of us realize that life without love is a weariness, a conflict bereft of hope, a struggle for no victory....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM"}}
