{"id":33039,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII","content":"1 Ronnie, shaking off Spillcroft, spent the luncheon adjournment alone. His bouts with the last witnesses, followed by the shock of Bert Bishop\u0027s proof, had rattled him. As he was leaving the court, the doorkeeper handed him another shock--a telegram. Opening it, he read, to his relief: \"All love and all success. Julia.\" But the growing crowd in the street, the multiplying posters, the comments which reached his ears as he made his hasty way towards Holborn, rattled him still further. His luck only added to his fears. Had it not been for the two anonymous notes, Maggie Peterson\u0027s evidence would have stood unchallenged. Now he could smash that evidence. But even now---even if the jury believed his side of the case sufficiently to discount Brunton\u0027s plea of premeditation--even if Bob Fielding and Lucy came well through the ordeal of Brunton\u0027s cross-questions--how, how the devil could he hope, unless some miracle gave his halting oratory genius, to secure a complete acquittal? Lunching alone in the crowded grill-room of the South-Eastern \u0026 Chatham Hotel, Ronnie\u0027s thoughts went back to other days. He saw himself soldier again, and remembered the particular type of moral courage, of self-control, necessary for the winning of battles. That moral courage, that self-control must be his again if he would win this fight against Brunton. \"This is my chance,\" he thought. \"My one chance of downing the brute. I mustn\u0027t muff it.\" Gradually solitude restored his balance. Gradually, his mind reconcentrated. Weeks of thought crystallized to short sentences. Lucy, Lucy Towers must be saved. Nothing but that mattered. The personal issue dwindled to unimportance. Walking back to the court, he found that he could think, even of his enemy, logically. 2 But when, a few minutes later, Ronald Cavendish, rising to open the defense of Lucy Towers, saw Hector Brunton bowed over his brief, nothing of him visible except a patch of gray wig, the hump of a black back, and one gentlemanly hand clutched round the gold pencil-case--then, for a moment, logic failed; and only the fear-stricken eyes of the woman in the dock, only his personal enmity for the man keyed him to the struggle. \"M\u0027 lord, members of the jury,\" he began, and there was no attempt at oratory in his beginning, \"it will be no part of my case to prove to you that Lucy Towers did not shoot her husband. She did shoot him. She shot him exactly as counsel for the Crown has proved to you. But when the Crown asks you to find my client guilty of wilful murder, when my learned friend brings what he is pleased to call evidence in support of malice and of premeditation; then I join issue with him. My submission to you is that there was, in what my client did, neither malice nor premeditation. \"Yet even if my learned friend fails--as it seems to me he must fail--to convince you of premeditation, that failure will not furnish me with sufficient grounds on which to ask you for my client\u0027s complete exoneration. Only on one ground can I ask you, as I intend to ask you, for your verdict of not guilty; and that ground, members of the jury, is justifiable or excusable homicide. \"Excusable homicide!\" For a full ten minutes, the voice, grave, low, meditative, calm as the voice of the judge himself, dealt with the legal aspect of excusability; and all the while Hector Brunton listened, motionless. But suddenly, as Ronnie\u0027s tone changed to the tone of the pleader, the \"hanging prosecutor\" shifted on his seat; and savagely he stared at his enemy. \"Those, members of the jury, are some of the grounds on which our law excuses the killing of one human being by another. But there are other grounds, grounds which not only excuse but justify. It is such justification, the fullest possible justification, which I purpose to plead. My learned friend, you may have noticed, was very careful to avoid any reference to the character or disposition of my client\u0027s husband. I, on the contrary, intend to deal with that point rather fully.\" Already the very quietness, the very certainty of that opening had impressed the court; and as, still quietly, yet with a hint of mounting passion behind it, the speech went on; as, point by point, counsel for the defense traversed the statements of counsel for the Crown, it seemed, even to the obtuse Spillcroft, as though the capital charge against Lucy Towers might fail. \"While as for the minor charge,\" continued Ronnie, \"the charge of manslaughter--of which, as his lordship will tell you, even though it is not pleaded on the indictment, it will be open to you to find my client guilty--on that charge, too, I intend to ask you for the completest acquittal.\" Brunton\u0027s stare relaxed. He hunched himself once more over his notes. And abruptly instinct, the instinct of the born advocate, warned Ronnie that he had spoken long enough. He glanced at the clock, at the jury. The jury--and especially the three women--were losing interest. Those women wanted neither argument nor oratory. They wanted drama. They were waiting, as spectators in a theater, for him to put Lucy Towers in the witness-box. So, abruptly, he regalvanized their interest. \"Members of the jury, my learned friend who leads for the Crown has been at great pains to convince you, out of the mouths of his witnesses, that Lucy Towers is both murderess and adulteress. I propose to afford him yet another opportunity of convincing you--by putting both my client and her cousin in the witness-box.\" At that, the whole court stiffened to attention, and even the judge, who seemed to have been dozing throughout the speech, leaned forward. \"Isn\u0027t he even going to deal with the evidence for the prosecution?\" thought the judge. But Ronnie purposely played his highest card last. \"Nevertheless, before you hear my client\u0027s story from her own lips, I must ask you to weigh very carefully certain evidence which the Crown has thought fit to call against her. With the testimony of John Hodges and of James Travers, honest testimony, let us hope, I shall deal at a later stage of these proceedings. But the evidence of Maggie Peterson calls for different treatment. Because Maggie Peterson has lied--and lied deliberately! \"Lied--and lied deliberately.\" Now, as passion mounted and mounted, kindling the quiet voice to rage, Brunton\u0027s head twitched from his brief, and his eyes, the cold gray eyes under the gray wig, glanced fearfully about the packed court-room. \"Because, on the night of July 4, the night when Maggie Peterson swears that she saw my client making her way to Robert Fielding\u0027s room, Maggie Peterson was not at 25 Laburnum Grove at all.\" Ronnie paused, letting his every word sink home. Rain, pattering suddenly on the glass dome above, seemed to emphasize the silence below. Then passionately the speech ended. \"My lord, members of the jury, I ask for no mercy. I ask only for justice. I ask you to remember, even while you are listening to my client\u0027s testimony, that the main evidence against her, the evidence of this woman Peterson is, from beginning to end, one tissue of deliberate lies, of the most wilful and corrupt perjury, as I shall prove to you out of the mouth of a competent witness, the landlord of the Red Lion Tavern, who will testify to you beyond the shadow of a doubt that from eight o\u0027clock till after ten on the night of July 4, Maggie Peterson never left his establishment; who will testify, moreover, that Maggie Peterson\u0027s companion on the night in question was none other than my unfortunate client\u0027s husband, William Towers himself.\" And on that, satisfied with the utter hush which followed, Ronald Cavendish put his client in the box. 3 There are seconds in every man\u0027s life when the conviction of his own wrong-doing shatters the edifice of conceit and flings illusion headlong. Such a second came to Hector Brunton, K.C., as he watched Lucy Towers step down from the side of the dock and make her way past the packed benches to the witness-box. With her--he could feel--went a wave, a great wave of human sympathy, the wave against which he, Hector Brunton, had been swimming for more than a year. Paralyzed he watched her--watched her take the oath, kiss the book. His mind was a torment, a torment of conscience. Conscience howled: \"You knew! You knew all the time that your principal witness was lying. You knew! You knew all the time that this woman was no adulteress. She\u0027s innocent, innocent, Hector Brunton; as innocent in intention as that other woman you\u0027ve been hounding.\" Cavendish\u0027s voice, the voice of his enemy, broke the spell. \"Mrs. Towers, while the oath you have just sworn is still fresh in your mind, I want you to answer this question. Have you ever, at any time in your life, been guilty of immorality with your cousin, Robert Fielding?\" \"Never.\" The answer, so diffident yet so definite, might have been Aliette\u0027s; and to Ronnie, his brain still throbbing from its own unaccustomed eloquence, it seemed, just for a fraction of a second, as though the woman he defended were indeed his own. \"Various witnesses for the Crown have stated that you were on bad terms with your husband. Are those statements true?\" \"I did my best to get on with him.\" The brown eyes never flinched. \"But he was a cruel man, especially when he was in drink.\" \"Nevertheless, you were faithful to him?\" \"Yes. Always.\" \"You heard Mrs. Peterson\u0027s evidence? She said,\" Ronnie referred to his notes, \"that at half-past nine o\u0027clock on the night of July 4, she saw you go into Robert Fielding\u0027s room. Have you any comment to make on that evidence?\" \"It\u0027s a lie. I never visited him at night. Only by day.\" \"At half-past nine on the night of July 4, where were you?\" \"I was in my own room, washing up the supper things.\" \"Was your husband with you?\" \"No.\" \"Where was he?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"One other point about Mrs. Peterson\u0027s evidence. She told us, if you remember, that you made a statement: that you said to her that you would never be happy till your husband was dead. What have you to say about that statement?\" \"It\u0027s another lie.\" The lips pursed, stubbornly--it seemed to Brunton--as his wife\u0027s own. \"An absolute lie.\" \"One moment, please!\" Mr. Justice Heber--every syllable of his question audible as the tinkle of glass--intervened. \"I should like to be clear on this point, Mrs. Towers. The witness to whom your counsel refers made the following statements: that at half-past nine o\u0027clock on the night of July 4 she saw you enter Robert Fielding\u0027s room; that you were in the habit of making such visits, and that she was standing in the passage between your room and hers when she saw you. Do I understand you positively to deny all three of those statements?\" \"Yes, m\u0027lord.\" \"And the witness in question further stated that you said to her: \u0027Bill isn\u0027t fit to be any woman\u0027s husband. I wish to God he was dead.\u0027 What have you to say to that?\" The woman in the witness-box did not hesitate. Deliberately her eyes met the judge\u0027s. Deliberately she answered his question: \"My lord, I may have said that Bill wasn\u0027t fit to be any woman\u0027s husband. But I never said,\" the shy voice rose, \"either to Maggie Peterson or to any one else, that I wished he was dead.\" \"She never said\"--word for word Mr. Justice Heber wrote down his answer--\"that she wished her husband was dead.\" But Hector Brunton--bent over his brief--could not write. For now, not only conscience, but all his years spent in separating truth from falsehood, all the experience of a legal lifetime, told him of Lucy\u0027s innocence. Again his enemy\u0027s voice broke the spell: \"You heard the evidence of John Hodges. He said that you told him somewhere about the end of last June that you wished you had never married your husband. Have you anything you would like to say in answer to that?\" \"Bill was there at the time. I only meant it for a joke.\" \"And now, before I ask you to tell his lordship and the jury, in your own words, what happened on the afternoon of July 5, I want you, if you can, to give me some idea of the feelings you entertained, before that date, for your husband.\" It was a daring, an unpremeditated, though not a leading question; and, even as he put it, Ronnie perceived its danger. Suppose the woman in the witness-box, the little dignified woman whose hands rested so quietly on the rail, whose whole attitude indicated nothing but the intensest desire to speak truth, should speak too much truth, should destroy--with one fatal word--the house of protection he was building about her? But neither the heart nor the truth in Lucy Towers failed. \"It wouldn\u0027t be right\"--the hands on the rail did not move--\"for me to pretend that I cared for Bill. He made my life an absolute hell. He drank and he used to knock me about. Many\u0027s the time I\u0027ve wished he was dead. But I never thought of killing him.\" \"Ah.\" Ronnie paused in his examination--one of those long, indefinable pauses which have more value than speech. Now--feeling the jury with him--he was no longer haunted by thought of his own inefficiency, no longer afraid of Brunton. Not Brunton\u0027s self could shake such a witness. Already, the first faint foretaste of victory quickened his pulse. His questions grew more and more daring. \"You said, in your statement at the police-station: \u0027My husband didn\u0027t like me going to Bob\u0027s room. He was jealous of Bob.\u0027 Can you give us any further details about that?\" \"Details!\" Lucy, her eyes downcast, appeared to be considering the question. She shot a glance at Brunton. Then, quietly, she said, \"Bill was always being jealous of some man or other--the same as Mr. Hodges said. But he hadn\u0027t got any reason to be jealous. I told him so, when he said I wasn\u0027t to go to Bob\u0027s room that afternoon. Me and Bob has always been pals--since we were kiddies. But if it hadn\u0027t been for Bob having no arms, I wouldn\u0027t have disobeyed Bill and gone to him.\u0027\u0027 \"I see. And can you tell me, coming to the afternoon of July 5, what your husband said when you threatened to disobey him--when you told him,\" Ronnie referred to his brief, \"\u0027I must go and help Bob because he can\u0027t feed himself\u0027?\" \"Bill said,\" the words were tremulous: \"\u0027If you don\u0027t stop here I\u0027ll come over and do in the pair of you.\u0027\" \"And what happened after that!\" \"I just went to Bob\u0027s room.\" \"And did you say anything to your cousin about your husband\u0027s threats?\" \"No.\" \"Can you tell me why you didn\u0027t?\" \"Because\"--unconsciously, the woman scored yet another point--\"because I didn\u0027t want Bob to see I was frightened.\" \"And now\"--Ronnie craned forward in his mounting excitement--\"and now, Mrs. Towers, I want you to describe to his lordship and the jury, in your own words, exactly what happened in Robert Fielding\u0027s room on the afternoon of July 5.\" \"I made Bob his tea, and I was helping him eat it when Bill came in,\" began the woman. No sounds save the scratch of reporters\u0027 pencils, the occasional tap of a boot-sole on the bare floor-boards, and the suppressed breathing of her tense audience interrupted the story Lucy Towers told her counsel and the court--a story so utterly resembling, yet so utterly differing from the toneless confession which the \"hanging prosecutor\" had read out the day before, a story so redolent of life and truth and certainty that, listening to it, it seemed as if one could actually see the dead man standing at the doorway of that bare tenement room, see the lifted stick in his hand, and hear his harsh, grim voice. \"Bill said, \u0027I\u0027ll do you in. I\u0027ll do you both in, damn you.\u0027 He had his stick in Ms hand. He lifted his stick. I was frightened. I thought he meant to kill Bob. I thought he meant to kill both of us. I remembered the pistol. I ran to the cupboard. I pulled out the pistol. I pointed it at him. Bob said, \u0027Look out, Bill. The gun\u0027s loaded.\u0027 Bill said, \u0027You can\u0027t frighten me.\u0027 I thought he was going to kill Bob, so I fired. \"So I fired.\" The little story ended to the indescribable, unbearable silence of men and women whose emotions are near to breaking-point. Through that unbearable silence, Ronnie\u0027s next question cut like a razor through taut string. \"You say that your husband carried a stick. Can you describe that stick?\" \"It was a heavy stick.\" \"Can\u0027t you tell me any more about it?\" \"Yes; it had a bit of lead in the handle.\" \"Was he holding the stick by the handle?\" \"No. By the other end.\" \"And you thought he meant to kill your cousin with that loaded stick?\" \"Yes. I felt sure of it. That was why I shot him.\" Ronnie paused again, making sure that his point should sink home in the minds of the jury. Then, picking up his copy of the confession, he put his last questions: \"I have here the statement which you made at the time of your arrest. You say, \u0027I\u0027m not sorry I killed my husband.\u0027 Why did you say that?\" \"Because I wasn\u0027t sorry--then.\" \"But you are sorry now?\" \"Yes. I didn\u0027t mean to kill him. I don\u0027t know why I said that. I didn\u0027t quite know what I was saying.\" \"And there was one other thing you said. You said, \u0027I love Bob very much.\u0027 Is that true?\" \"Yes.\" Lucy Towers answered fearlessly. \"I do love him, but not in the way\"--her eyes, which had scarcely left Ronnie\u0027s since the examination began, turned for a moment to Hector Brunton, huddled in his seat--\"not in the way that he tried to make out.\" \"Thank you, Mrs. Towers. That\u0027s all I have to ask,\" finished Ronald Cavendish; and, seating himself, waited for Hector Brunton\u0027s onslaught. But the onslaught tarried. Almost it seemed as if Hector Brunton were going to leave that cross-examination, on which the whole case hung, to his junior. For now Hector Brunton heard, louder than the whisper of conscience, the very whisper of God. \"Thou art the man,\" whispered God; \"thou art the murderer.\" The \"hanging prosecutor\" looked at the woman in the dock, and his courage failed before the accusing glance of her. The \"hanging prosecutor\" looked at the judge, at the massed spectators; and his heart quailed before the doubting glances of them. Then the \"hanging prosecutor\" looked at his enemy; and rage, the rage of the lusting male, took him by the throat. God\u0027s whisper forgotten, man\u0027s duty forgotten, all save this one last chance of vengeance forgotten; he rose, heavy as the wounded bull, to his ungainly feet. His brain, the cold sure-functioning legal brain, had not yet failed. He still knew his strength. But a red mist blinded his eyes, and through that red mist he saw, not Lucy Towers but Aliette; Aliette, whom every cheated fiber of his body yearned to torture--and, torturing, possess. \"You admit that you shot your husband?\" The words--grim, bitter, devil-prompted--grated in Brunton\u0027s throat. \"Yes.\" \"You admit that you said, just after you had shot him, that you were not sorry for the deed?\" \"That\u0027s written down.\" \"Answer my question, please. Do you admit that you said, just after your husband\u0027s death at your hands, that you were not sorry you had killed him?\" \"That\u0027s written down,\" repeated Lucy Towers stubbornly. And the stubbornness sent a chill through the red mist; a chill that pierced to Hector Brunton\u0027s very marrow. Thus--thus stubborn and unwrithing--thus clear-eyed and contemptuous, had this same woman outfaced him, long and long ago in the bright, miserable drawing-room at Lancaster Gate. \"You have admitted\"--there was a singing in the K.C.\u0027s ears; he could hardly hear his own voice--\"that you love your cousin, Robert Fielding. I put it to you that you are Robert Fielding\u0027s mistress.\" \"No.\" \"I put it to you that you went to Robert Fielding\u0027s room nightly.\" \"It\u0027s a lie.\" \"I put it to you that ever since Robert Fielding came to live at 25 Laburnum Grove you have been in the habit of misconducting yourself with him.\" \"It\u0027s a lie.\" \"I put it to you\"--God! if only he could make her writhe; if only he could see one stab of pain twitch those cheeks--\"that you love Robert Fielding.\" \"Not in the way you\u0027re trying to make out.\" \"I put it to you that it was because of your love for Robert Fielding that you shot your husband.\" \"No.\" \"Then why did you shoot him?\" \"My lord,\"--Cavendish\u0027s voice--\"I protest. This is outrageous.\" \"I\u0027m afraid, Mr. Cavendish,\"--Heber\u0027s voice--\"I must allow the question.\" \"Why did you shoot your husband?\" Brunton heard his own voice, very faint through the buzz at his ears. \"I have already told you\"--he heard Aliette\u0027s voice--\"I killed him because I thought he was going to kill Bob.\" \"You meant to kill him, then?\" Again his enemy\u0027s protest. Again the judge\u0027s doubtful, \"I feel I must allow the question.\" Again Aliette\u0027s stubborn reply: \"No. I never meant to kill him. I didn\u0027t think about that. I only wanted to save Bob.\" Momentarily the red mist cleared from Brunton\u0027s sight. He knew this woman for Lucy Towers--Lucy Towers against whom, despite the flaws in the evidence, he had advised prosecution for wilful murder; knew himself doomed to failure with her--as he had always been doomed to failure with Aliette; knew that, against the sheer rock of truth in the one, as against the rock of sheer truth in the other, the spray of his lawless hate must beat in vain. Then the red mist thickened, thickened and thickened, again before Brunton\u0027s smarting eyes. Rage kindled in his bowels, kindled from bowels to brain, burning away self-control. He was aware only of Cavendish--of Cavendish, utterly cold, utterly legal--of Cavendish protesting for his witness, protecting his witness--of Cavendish\u0027s will, thrusting bar after cold steel bar between himself and the woman. The singing was still in Brunton\u0027s ears; and now it grew dark in court, so that the face of the woman faded from his sight; and now it grew light in court, so that the face of the woman showed itself to him as a white contemptuous sneer under the electrics; but still, blindly, he tortured her with his questions. At last he heard his own voice clearly once again, \"You deny, then, that you are an adulteress?\"; heard her answer, \"Yes. I deny that absolutely\"; heard, as a murderer hearing his own sentence, Mr. Justice Heber\u0027s, \"If that finishes your cross-examination, Mr. Brunton, I shall adjourn until ten o\u0027clock tomorrow\"; heard, as a murderer hears the tramp of feet outside his cell, Cavendish\u0027s quiet, \"With your lordship\u0027s permission, there is one witness, one most important witness, whom I should like to call before the court adjourns\"; listened, powerless to cross-examine, while the witness of Cartwright\u0027s finding tore Maggie Peterson\u0027s testimony in pieces. 4 As Ronnie, striding solitary home, saw on the posters \"Towers Case Sensation; Witness Arrested for Perjury.\" it seemed to him as though victory had been already in his grasp. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316/90626.html","bookId":400,"book":{"id":400,"title":"The Love Story of Aliette Brunton","description":"简介： In our heart of hearts--which we in England take almost as much pains to hide from ourselves as from our fellow-creatures--most of us realize that life without love is a weariness, a conflict bereft of hope, a struggle for no victory....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM"}}
