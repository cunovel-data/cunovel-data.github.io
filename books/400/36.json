{"id":33042,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV","content":"1 They were burying that flesh which had been Julia Cavendish among the cypresses of the South London cemetery whither she brought back the flesh which had been Ronnie\u0027s father when Ronnie was still a lad. To all save three of the mourners it appeared as though death had conquered scandal, as though their every personal enmity were being laid to rest. But to James Wilberforce, standing at the brink of the grave, it appeared that he stood on the brink of a scandal so tremendous that nothing except the combined brains of Wilberforce, Wilberforce \u0026 Cartwright could prevent a social catastrophe, a regular holocaust of public reputations; his own, possibly, and Mollie\u0027s of a certainty, included. Covertly, James Wilberforce looked at the semicircle of facts gathered round the white-surpliced clergyman. All Julia\u0027s family--Benthams, Edwardses, Robinsons; all her literary friends--Paul Flower, Dot Fancourt, Jack Coole, Robert Backwell, the Binneys; most of her many acquaintances among the various circles with which she had been intimate, were there to do her the last honor. A little aloof stood the reporters; and at them James Wilberforce looked, too. \"God knows what the newspapers won\u0027t say if this thing isn\u0027t hushed up,\" thought Jimmy. The letter of the dead, those four handwritten sheets in their bulky envelope which Mrs. Sanderson had handed to him immediately on his arrival at Daffadillies, burned the solicitor\u0027s pocket. He thought how cleverly, yet how unwisely \"the old lady\u0027s\" plans had been laid; how, by adding a certain codicil to her will, she had made it virtually impossible for her executors to save the situation. The clergyman was reading. \"Man that is born of woman,\" read the clergyman, \"hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery.\" \"O holy and most merciful Savior, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.\" Jimmy\u0027s thoughts wandered. \"I wonder if I ought to tell Mollie,\" he thought. \"I wonder if we ought to get married at once. I wonder how the devil we\u0027re going to break things to Mollie\u0027s sister. I wonder Mollie\u0027s sister didn\u0027t come to the funeral. Better not, I suppose.\" The coffin on its canvas slings sank from sight into the moss-lined grave. It touched the bottom of the grave; and the slings relaxed. \"Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy,\" read the clergyman, as Ronnie sprinkled a handful of earth on the coffin-lid. \"From henceforth blessed are the dead which die in the Lord; even so saith the Spirit; for they rest from their labors.\" James Wilberforce\u0027s mind came back to the ceremony. He looked at his friend. \"Poor Ronnie,\" he mused, \"his labors are only just begun.\" And so musing, Jimmy\u0027s gaze fell on a bearded man with an old-fashioned top-hat in his hand, who held himself very erect and a little apart from the remainder of the mourners. \"Rather sporting of Rear-Admiral Billy B. to turn up,\" thought James Wilberforce. 2 The funeral service was over. The clergyman, his surplice crinkling in the October wind, had returned to the chapel. By twos and threes the mourners were deserting the graveside. Ahead of them, unrecognized except by Wilberforce, went Rear-Admiral Billy, his head high, his heart troubled. Soon--felt the admiral--a parson and mourners would gather for him, for an old man who would have to face his God with a promise unfulfilled, with a duty unaccomplished. The last of the mourners disappeared through the cemetery fates to their conveyances, leaving only Ronnie, Sir Peter, James Wilberforce and the sexton by the grave. \"We\u0027d better take him back to Bruton Street with us,\" whispered Sir Peter to his son. \"The less we delay things, at the present juncture----\" \"Ronald, old chap\"--Jimmy put a hand on his friend\u0027s shoulder,--\"pater says he\u0027ll drive you home in our car. We\u0027ve got to get this matter settled, and the sooner we come to some decision----\" \"Very well.\" Ronnie, his face a purposeful mask, turned away from the scarred earth. \"The mater\u0027s dead,\" he thought. \"Dead. It\u0027s my duty to do as she would have done had she lived.\" And while the three of them made their way slowly to Sir Peter\u0027s Daimler, he fell to resenting that Aliette had effaced herself from Julia\u0027s funeral. His mother had wished that he and Aliette should face the world together. His mother\u0027s wishes must be carried out, carried out faithfully. 3 Arrived at Bruton Street, Ronnie led his self-invited guests into the little box of a work-room; and, facing the pair of them from across his mother\u0027s Empire desk, said provocatively: \"Sir Peter, it\u0027s no use. I\u0027ve made up my mind. As I told Jimmy when he showed me the will, my mother\u0027s wishes must be carried out.\" \"But what were your mother\u0027s wishes?\" The white-haired, white-mustached old gentleman who had steered so many social ships clear of the rocks, smiled benignly. \"What were your mother\u0027s real wishes? Naturally, both my son and I recognize her object. But, much as we appreciate the filial devotion which prompts you to carry out her exact wishes, we have to consider the spirit of those wishes. Now suppose, mind you I\u0027m only supposing, that we publish this book. The publication, as you yourself must be the first to admit, may defeat the very object your mother had in mind when she wrote it. Moreover, quite apart from the expense to the estate----\" \"But the expense is provided for, pater,\" interrupted Jimmy. \"And in view of the testator\u0027s letter to me----\" \"That letter leaves the ultimate decision with us.\" Sir Peter, who loathed interruptions, shot an irritated glance at his son. \"If we decide that this book should not see the light of day----\" \"I\u0027ll never consent to that.\" Ronnie\u0027s voice was the voice of a fanatic. \"And besides, even if the book were not published, there\u0027s always the codicil.\" \"Admitted.\" Sir Peter frowned. \"The codicil is the difficulty. I wonder if you\u0027d mind reading it to me again, Jimmy.\" Jimmy got up, fumbled in the pocket of his overcoat, drew out a bulky document, unfolded it, and began to read, very slowly, the paragraph appended in Julia Cavendish\u0027s own handwriting to the last page: I empower and charge my executors, Ronald Cavendish and Sir Peter Wilberforce, to devote any sum they may think fit, up to ten thousand pounds, for the purpose of having published my book entitled, \"Man\u0027s Law,\" and more particularly for indemnifying the publishers of the same against any libel action which may be brought against them by Hector Brunton, K.C. And I further instruct my executors to invest the sum of twenty thousand pounds for the benefit of Aliette, n√©e Fullerford, at present the wife of Hector Brunton, K.C. The said sum to become the absolute property of Aliette Brunton so soon as her legal husband, either by his death or by the process of divorce, sets her free to marry my son, Ronald Cavendish. \"Rather vague,\" commented Sir Peter. \"Is it properly witnessed?\" \"Yes.\" James Wilberforce laid the will on the desk, and stared ruminatively at his father. His father stared back at Jimmy. Both knew how impossible it would be to contest that codicil without the publicity of the courts. Both knew how fatal any publicity would be to their client. But their client only laughed. \"You see, Sir Peter, there\u0027s no way out. Even if I consented not to publish the book, this will has to be proved.\" \"But that means immediate publicity.\" \"Exactly.\" Ronald\u0027s mouth shut like the teeth of a pike. His eyes, in their resolution, were his mother\u0027s own. \"Exactly.\" Sir Peter, hitherto blandness itself, grew irritable. \"You don\u0027t appear to realize, Cavendish, that the proving of this will means a terrific scandal.\" \"I realize that perfectly, Sir Peter. But scandal--as I see it--is the only way to effect my mother\u0027s object.\" \"All the same, I should not be doing my duty, either as your mother\u0027s friend or as your co-trustee, if I did not ask you before we come to any decision, to consider, first, the effect such a scandal would have on your career, and secondly, the effect it would have\"--purposely the baronet paused--\"on the reputation of the lady in the case.\" \"As far as the lady in the case is concerned,\" Ronnie\u0027s fingers rapped the desk-top, \"her freedom is the paramount consideration.\" \"Is that the lady\u0027s view, or your own?\" Sir Peter, seeing an ivory paper-knife near at hand, drew it quietly toward him. \"My own.\" At that, Jimmy, who had been watching his friend carefully, rose and began to stride slowly up and down the little room. Quite apart from the personal issue (if the worst came to the worst, he and Mollie would have to be married by special license before the crash came!), it seemed to Jimmy that his friend must be saved, somehow or other, from the consequences of his own obstinacy. But how--how in the name of the law--could that saving be accomplished? \"And if the lady disapproves?\" said Sir Peter. \"She will not disapprove,\" countered Ronnie. In the pause which followed, Jimmy drew out Julia Cavendish\u0027s letter, and read it for the tenth time. If I have brought any happiness into your life by bringing you and the woman you are going to marry together, help me to bring happiness into my son\u0027s life and into the life of the woman whom he is not able to marry. I feel that I have taken the best, the only way to put things right for Ronnie; but if there is any other method by which my main object, the object of forcing Hector Brunton to set his wife free, is possible of achievement, by all means explore it. \"Don\u0027t you think\"--James Wilberforce put the letter back in his pocket and turned to Ronnie, who was eying his father in positive hostility--\"that it might be advisable to discuss this matter with--Hector Brunton?\" \"I won\u0027t have that. I\u0027ll be damned if I\u0027ll have that.\" Ronnie\u0027s answer was openly provocative; but Sir Peter apparently had recovered his temper. \"We mustn\u0027t be hasty,\" purred Sir Peter. \"We mustn\u0027t be overhasty. As Julia Cavendish\u0027s executors, we have to regard the spirit rather than the letter of her instructions. Believe me, the immediate publication of that codicil would be fatal to the plans which your dear mother obviously had in mind. Fatal!\" And the baronet, lighting himself a cigarette, relapsed into thought. Privately he considered that his old friend must have been mentally deranged some time before her death. Yet he dared not say so to her son; and, moreover, to prove mental derangement would entail more publicity than to prove the will itself. Various plans for the avoidance of publicity began to pass through Sir Peter\u0027s mind. Brunton, faced with the alternative of the book\u0027s being published, might consent to file his petition for divorce. Then, Julia\u0027s main object accomplished, the book might be--accidentally destroyed. Other methods, too--gentler methods--might be adopted with the book. But what in Hades was one to do about the will? Unfortunately, tampering with wills constituted a felony. Therefore, unless some one (\"And whom could I get to do it!\" mused Sir Peter) risked going to jail, that will, that deadly, damning, white-faced, blue-written testament on the desk would have to be filed in toto at Somerset House. Filed, every pressman in England would seize upon it for a column. A knock, followed by a voice asking, \"May I come in, Ronnie?\" brought the three men to their feet; and, before any of them could answer, the door opened, revealing \"the lady in the case.\" Aliette, her face pale above the high black mourning frock, stood irresolute in the doorway. \"I\u0027m so sorry if I\u0027m interrupting,\" she said. \"I thought you\u0027d gone, Sir Peter. I\u0027ll go away if you\u0027re talking business.\" \"We are talking business, dear lady,\" purred the baronet, playing with his acquired paper-knife. \"Business which affects you more than anybody.\" And he looked at Ronnie as though to say, \"Surely you\u0027ll consent to my consulting the person most concerned.\" Ronnie signaled acquiescence; Jimmy closed the door; Aliette sat down; and Sir Peter began to speak. At first Aliette could not grasp what the baronet was talking about. For three days now, her mind, still numb from the shock of Julia\u0027s sudden passing, had been obsessed by its own problems. Ronnie, she knew, was keeping some secret from her--as she from him. His secret, she guessed vaguely, must be in connection with his mother\u0027s book. Hers---- Gradually Sir Peter\u0027s words became comprehensible. He was reading Julia Cavendish\u0027s will. In so far as Aliette could understand the peculiar legal phraseology, Julia Cavendish had left everything to Ronnie. It struck her as curious that Sir Peter should go to all that trouble. Curious, too, that both Ronnie and his friend should look so worried! Ronnie would be even more worried if he knew that---- \"That is the will,\" Sir Peter\u0027s voice interrupted the disturbing thought, \"as my firm drafted it some years ago. But that will has been altered. Perhaps, before I read the alteration, I\u0027d better explain to you about the book.\" Now Aliette grew conscious of a question in her lover\u0027s eyes. The eyes never left her face. James Wilberforce, too, was eying her in a way that she could not understand. And suddenly Ronnie laid a hand upon her shoulder. Sir Peter went on; \"As you probably know, Mrs. Cavendish finished a novel just before she died. I have not yet read the manuscript of that novel, but it appears, from what my son and your--er--husband, who have read it, tell me, that the book is a roman √† clef. A roman √† clef, as I need hardly explain to you, dealing, as it does, with living people, sometimes results in a libel action. It is, among other things, to provide against the possibility of such a libel action that Mrs. Cavendish, without my firm\u0027s knowledge, altered her will.\" \"A libel action, Sir Peter?\" Aliette\u0027s question was automatic. \"Yes. A libel action.\" The baronet picked his every word with care. \"A libel action which might be brought against Mrs. Cavendish\u0027s estate and against the publishers of her book by your--er--former husband.\" \"Brought by Hector!\" The exclamation, low and immediately suppressed, barely escaped Aliette\u0027s lips. But her shoulder trembled under Ronnie\u0027s hand; for now, in one inspired moment, she had grasped the secret of the book. Memory, casting back, recalled and understood every personal question put to her by the dead. Sir Peter had stopped speaking. His eyes under the gold-rimmed glasses were perturbed, yet kindly. Obviously he found the situation difficult. She waited for Ronnie or James to intervene; but they, too, remained dumb. And, \"Do I understand,\" asked Aliette, summoning up all her courage, \"that this novel is a personal story--the story of my\"--her whole body quivered--\"matrimonial difficulties?\" Ronnie removed his hand from her shoulder. James nodded assent. Admiration and gratitude mingled in Sir Peter\u0027s: \"You\u0027ve defined the matter exactly. One of the questions on which I should like your views is,\" the careful words paused, \"whether or no this book should be published.\" Fleetingly, Aliette thought, \"Shall I tell them ... about myself? Does it make any difference?\" Her intuition, suddenly active, remembered two hints dropped--purposefully perhaps--by Ronnie\u0027s mother. \"Public judgment is usually inaccurate because the public is not told the whole truth\"; \"My dear, if only the whole world realized, as I realize, your story, they would not misjudge you.\" \"My views----\" she parried aloud, playing for time. \"Publicity,\" she thought. \"The flaunting policy once more. Dear God, that too.\" And, revisualizing the ordeal at Patrick O\u0027Riordan\u0027s first night, her nerve frayed. Why couldn\u0027t these three men leave her in peace--in peace? Looking at Ronnie, she saw his eyes very resolute. He said: \"My decision is that the book must be published.\" \"Please let me finish, Cavendish,\" broke in Sir Peter; and to Aliette: \"There are other points besides the publication of this book to be decided.\" Then he read to her, always in the same soft purr, the codicil; and explained, in tense, reasoned sentences, the consequences of its publication in the press, ending: \"It means, to use a rather old-fashioned phrase, social ruin.\" For a long while Aliette sat silent, her eyes wide, her pale hands clutching the black folds of her dress. Womanlike, she tried to put herself into the mind of the dead. Why had Julia Cavendish done this thing? Why? Could Julia have guessed that---- Womanlike, Aliette looked into the future, and her cheeks grew hot. Ronnie said: \"He can\u0027t bring an action for libel without bringing one for divorce\"; Sir Peter, \"Let\u0027s stick to our point; the publication of this codicil means disaster--for all three of you.\" \"It means Aliette\u0027s freedom,\" retorted Ronnie. The words of the codicil stood out in fire on the screen of Aliette\u0027s mind. She saw those words published, saw the book published, saw scandal follow scandal. Sir Peter was right. This thing meant ruin, social ruin for herself, for Ronnie, for Hector. And yet, and yet--it meant freedom. But would freedom come in time? She glanced at the three men: at Ronnie and James, on their feet, motionless; at Sir Peter, seated at the desk, his hand fidgeting the ivory paper-knife. Swiftly, as a shuttle through the warp, her mind threaded the skeins of the future. The future would hold more than Ronnie. \"Before you take any decision,\" Jimmy spoke, \"read this.\" He laid a letter before her. She read the letter through twice, her mind fighting for self-control, before asking: \"And is there no other method by which Mrs. Cavendish\u0027s \u0027main object\u0027 can be achieved, Sir Peter?\" Sir Peter\u0027s hand ceased fidgeting at the knife. \"There may be a way,\" he said doubtfully. \"But whether we can take it or not depends on your--er--former husband.\" Blazing, Ronnie intervened. \"Once and for all, I\u0027ll have no favors from that--that blackguard. He\u0027s made his own bed. Let him lie in it. Who the devil cares about scandal nowadays? I don\u0027t. And if Brunton does, so much the worse for him.\" But the baronet\u0027s next remark shattered heroics. \"I think,\" said the baronet sarcastically, \"that as my co-executor is getting so very excited, we had better adjourn our conference. Perhaps you\u0027ll let me know what you both decide.\" 4 Late that same evening, Aliette and her lover sat alone in the familiar drawing-room among the familiar things--the jade idols, the Toby mugs, the Spanish velvets, and the Venetian brocades which Julia Cavendish had collected for her delight. Ever since their hasty dinner--most of the staff were still at Daffadillies--Ronnie had been urging her decision. Ever since dinner, haggard, she had been playing for time. \"It was my mother\u0027s wish,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s prove the will; publish the book; take the consequences. Anything\u0027s worth while--if only he\u0027ll divorce you.\" \"Is it?\" Dully, the woman\u0027s mind was looking for a loophole. \"Is it worth while to ruin three lives?\" \"Three?\" \"Yes, dear. Yours--and mine ... and--and Hector\u0027s,\" \"Hector!\" The rage in Ronnie\u0027s voice terrified her, as it had been terrifying her all the evening. \"We needn\u0027t consider him. He hasn\u0027t considered us. There would have been no need for all this if he\u0027d been reasonable; if he\u0027d brought his action for divorce when I asked him to.\" \"There are others we ought to consider, too.\" Aliette\u0027s hand, as she fondled her lover\u0027s rigid arm, was tremulous. \"Mollie, James, my parents. They\u0027ll all suffer if you--if we carry this thing through.\" \"They must look after themselves. They\u0027ve done nothing to help us. Don\u0027t let\u0027s discuss the matter further. Believe me, it\u0027s the only way to get what we want.\" \"But Sir Peter said----\" \"Sir Peter\u0027s only a solicitor. Even if that blackguard did file his petition, the will and the book would have to be published.\" \"Why are you so bitter, man?\" Aliette\u0027s eyes suffused. \"I\u0027m not bitter. Only just. He had no mercy on Lucy Towers. I\u0027ll have none on him.\" Aliette\u0027s hands ceased their fondling. For a little while she sat silent, unmoving among the deep cushions. Her mind, busied so long, could function no longer. She felt her womanliness naked--flesh quivering under the lash. She wanted to say to him: \u0027Ronnie, there\u0027s something--something you don\u0027t know.\u0027 But suddenly her courage--the courage which had carried her, carried them both, through the hard-run months--broke. She began to sob. Like a broken soul she sobbed--sobbed to herself, faintly, feebly; careless--as Lucy Towers had been careless--of the man who strove to comfort her. Words came, feebly, through the sobs: \"Man, I meant to make you so happy. I meant to make everybody happy. But I\u0027ve failed--failed. I\u0027m not blaming you. I\u0027m not blaming your mother. You and your mother have done everything. Everything. It\u0027s only I who have been useless--useless. And I meant, heaven only knows how much I meant, to be of use. Before I ran away with you I reasoned it all out. I thought that I was doing right. There didn\u0027t seem to be any one else to consider except you and me.\" She broke off. Then, almost fiercely, she asked him: \"Tell me I\u0027ve been a little bit of use? Tell me I\u0027ve made you happy--just sometimes----\" \"Of course you\u0027ve made me happy.\" He tried to take her hands; but her hands shrank from him. \"I don\u0027t believe it You\u0027re only saying that to comfort me.\" \"I\u0027m not.\" \"You are.\" Hysteria took her by the throat. \"You hate me. If you don\u0027t hate me--you ought to. I killed your mother.\" She broke off again, sobbing. \"Alie\"--the tone told her that he thought her crazy--\"what\u0027s the matter with you? Nothing could have saved Julia. Sir Heron told me.\" \"Sir Heron wouldn\u0027t tell you. Nobody would tell you anything. You\u0027re only a man. All men are the same. You\u0027re only thinking about yourself. You\u0027re not thinking about me. You only want your revenge on--on Hector. Why shouldn\u0027t you have your revenge?\" Suddenly, her sobbing ceased; and she faced him--this Aliette he could not understand--dry-eyed and venomous. \"Have your revenge on him if you want to. But don\u0027t pretend you\u0027re being just. Don\u0027t pretend you\u0027re being heroic. Don\u0027t pretend you\u0027re any better than he is. You\u0027re not. He\u0027s a man, just the same as you are. You talk about my freedom. You say scandal doesn\u0027t matter. Perhaps it doesn\u0027t--to a man. Perhaps it oughtn\u0027t to matter to me, I\u0027ve belonged to two----\" At that, for the first and last time in their lives, Aliette was physically afraid of her lover. His arms, which had been seeking to comfort, abandoned her. He sprang to his feet. Jealousy, a red and angry aura of jealousy, exuded from him. \"Christ!\" he burst out, \"Christ! You needn\u0027t remind me of that.\" Speech died at his lips. Furiously he strode from her--strode up and down the familiar room, the room in which, months since, she had given her unspoken promise to Julia Cavendish. The scene came back to her now. She thought, \"What have I been saying? Dear God, what have I been saying?\" Hysteria went out of her, as fever goes out, leaving her weak, nerveless. \"Damn it!\" he was muttering, \"damn it! Do you think I ever forget that once--once----\" She wanted to cry out to him, \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you. You\u0027re hurting me now, hurting me beyond all bearing.\" But she knew that, hurt, she dared not cry out; knew that this was the hardest of the path, the full price, the full torment exacted. Sitting there, rigid, uncomplaining, teeth bit to the under lip lest the mouth should cry out its torture, she remembered the long years with Hector, the mornings and the evenings when, facing him over the breakfast-table or the dinner-table, listening after dinner to his voice in the library, tolerating--for the sake of the dream which this other man had made true--the ungentle fury of his caresses, she had learned to wear the mask which so many married women wear, the mask of compliance. Must she, for Ronnie\u0027s sake, still wear the mask? Daren\u0027t she tell him--the truth? Wouldn\u0027t he--knowing the truth--flinch from his purpose? Wasn\u0027t it worth while, more than worth while, to keep silence till the die was cast? Couldn\u0027t she still play for time? Time! There might be some way--some other way to freedom. If only she weren\u0027t so afraid--so strangely and newly afraid! If only Ronnie were not so angry! And suddenly she knew that Ronnie\u0027s anger had left him. His feet stopped in mid-stride. Slowly he came across the room toward her; and she could see a little of the old understanding tenderness in his blue eyes. \"Alie,\" he said, \"forgive me.\" \"What is there to forgive?\" Her voice sounded listless, broken. \"It was my fault. I oughtn\u0027t to have spoken as I did. I called up the past. I had no right to call up the past. The past\u0027s dead. There\u0027s only the future----\" \"Our future.\" He was on his knees to her now; and dumbly she put out her hands to him; dumbly she fondled his temples. Once more she wanted to cry; but no tears came. Her tongue felt parched, as though by some bitter fruit. \"It wasn\u0027t your fault, Alie. You\u0027re tired. And perhaps I\u0027m not being just. Perhaps I do want my revenge. But it\u0027s only for your sake\"--his hands sought her shoulders--\"only for your sake that I hate him. I think, I know, that if he\u0027d made you happy, if he\u0027d been kind to you, I could bear the thought of him. But he made you miserable. He hurt you. He\u0027s hurting you now. When I think of that, I go mad; mad with hatred.\" She leaned forward; and words came to her. \"You mustn\u0027t hate him. We mustn\u0027t either of us hate him. We\u0027re as much to blame as he is. At least, I am. I\u0027m a rotten woman. Rotten.\" \"You\u0027re not. You \u0027re the best woman in the world.\" Still on his knees to her by the sofa, he pressed her to him--gently, with that gentleness which had first won her heart. And desperately her heart wanted to tell him everything. But tears, tears of sheer weakness, choked her once more. \"Don\u0027t cry, darling. Please don\u0027t cry.\" Conscience-wrung, Ronnie could find no other words. The sense of his responsibility, of that awful responsibility for another\u0027s happiness, which only illegal lovers know, coiled--tighter than her arms; tighter than any hempen rope--round his neck. Her tears on his cheeks were as warm rain conjuring up the seedlings of remembrance. He recollected all the miracle of their early love for one another, all their resistances and their yieldings, all the weeks and all the months through which they had faced the herd\u0027s hostility in mutual loyalty, setting love above the law, trusting in one another--he in her as she in him--for faith. Always they had kept faith with one another. Yet always she, the woman, had borne the heavier burden. And in his ignorance he thought: \"That\u0027s why I must insist--insist on this thing going through.\" Then a voice, as it were his mother\u0027s, whispered to the mind of Ronald Cavendish: \"Comfort her, Ronnie, comfort her. Before you ask this last sacrifice, tell her that the past has not been in vain\"; and then, leaning on her lover, her eyes tear-blinded, her hands slack, her limbs relaxed in misery, Aliette heard him whisper: \"Darling woman. Darling girl. You\u0027re not to think that I don\u0027t understand. I do understand--everything.\" Like waves, the deeps of his fondness poured from him, poured over her, healing her wounds; and for a moment she thought that he had guessed the truth. But his next words dispelled illusion. \"I know all that you\u0027ve given up for my sake; all that I\u0027ve made you give. The blame, if blame there be, is mine. You\u0027ve sacrificed yourself for me.\" \"It\u0027s no sacrifice.\" Hardly, she stirred in his arms. \"I\u0027ve never regretted----\" \"Nor I, dear. Nor I. I\u0027ve never regretted for one single instant. I never shall regret. Ever since that first day I saw you, you\u0027ve been all the world to me. All the world. That\u0027s why I want you to be strong, not to be afraid of scandal, to let me do as my mother wished.\" \"Ronnie\"--her eyes, wet with tears, sought his,--\"have you counted the cost?\" \"Yes.\" He released her; and she saw, as he rose up, that he was still resolute. \"I\u0027ve counted the cost. And it\u0027ll be heavy--heavier than anything we\u0027ve had to bear yet. But it\u0027ll be worth while, Alie. Anything\u0027s worth while--if only I can win you your freedom.\" \"But your career----\" \"My career doesn\u0027t matter any more. I\u0027ve had success. I know how little it\u0027s worth. Nothing matters to me now except your happiness.\" \"My happiness?\" Wistfully she looked down at her pale hands. \"Yes, your happiness. Oh, my dear, don\u0027t think I haven\u0027t realized, all these months, that you\u0027ll never be happy--really and truly happy--while you belong, legally, to that man.\" \"Ronnie\"--she was trying, trying to tell him--\"I have been happy. Always. It isn\u0027t that----\" \"Yes, it is.\" He was afraid lest, pleading again, she should weaken his decision. \"It\u0027s only that. Once you\u0027re my wife, you\u0027ll forget all the unhappy times.\" \"Shall I?\" she thought. \"Will that little ceremony make me forget that once, once I was Hector\u0027s?\" \"That\u0027s why I want you to make up your mind,\" went on Ronnie. \"Now. To-night. That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t want you to listen to Sir Peter. Alie, it isn\u0027t for my revenge I\u0027m asking you to let me do this. It\u0027s for your own sake. If you were a different sort of woman, a rotten woman, perhaps it wouldn\u0027t matter so much--our not being married. But you--you can\u0027t go on forever like this. Just think, darling, just think what it would mean if we were to have children.\" \"Children,\" she repeated dully, \"children.\" And then, his very vehemence terrifying her again, \"Oh, Ronnie, Ronnie--don\u0027t ask me to decide to-night.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316/90629.html","bookId":400,"book":{"id":400,"title":"The Love Story of Aliette Brunton","description":"ÁÆÄ‰ªãÔºö In our heart of hearts--which we in England take almost as much pains to hide from ourselves as from our fellow-creatures--most of us realize that life without love is a weariness, a conflict bereft of hope, a struggle for no victory....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:43 AM"}}
