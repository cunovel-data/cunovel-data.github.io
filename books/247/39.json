And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured. \n [bbe] And he gave Joseph control of all his property, keeping no account of anything, but only the food which was put before him. Now Joseph was very beautiful in form and face. \n 39:7 [hgb] 这 事 以 后 ， 约 瑟 主 人 的 妻 以 目 送 情 给 约 瑟 ， 说 ， 你 与 我 同 寝 吧 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass after these things, that his master\u0027s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. \n [bbe] And after a time, his master\u0027s wife, looking on Joseph with desire, said to him, Be my lover. \n 39:8 [hgb] 约 瑟 不 从 ， 对 他 主 人 的 妻 说 ， 看 哪 ， 一 切 家 务 ， 我 主 人 都 不 知 道 。 他 把 所 有 的 都 交 在 我 手 里 。 \n [kjv] But he refused, and said unto his master\u0027s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; \n [bbe] But he would not, and said to her, You see that my master keeps no account of what I do in his house, and has put all his property in my control; \n 39:9 [hgb] 在 这 家 里 没 有 比 我 大 的 。 并 且 他 没 有 留 下 一 样 不 交 给 我 ， 只 留 下 了 你 ， 因 为 你 是 他 的 妻 子 。 我 怎 能 作 这 大 恶 ， 得 罪 神 呢 ？ \n [kjv] There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? \n [bbe] So that no one has more authority in this house than I have; he has kept nothing back from me but you, because you are his wife; how then may I do this great wrong, sinning against God? \n 39:10 [hgb] 后 来 她 天 天 和 约 瑟 说 ， 约 瑟 却 不 听 从 她 ， 不 与 她 同 寝 ， 也 不 和 她 在 一 处 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. \n [bbe] And day after day she went on requesting Joseph to come to her and be her lover, but he would not give ear to her. \n 39:11 [hgb] 有 一 天 ， 约 瑟 进 屋 里 去 办 事 ， 家 中 人 没 有 一 个 在 那 屋 里 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. \n [bbe] Now one day he went into the house to do his work; and not one of the men of the house was inside. \n 39:12 [hgb] 妇 人 就 拉 住 他 的 衣 裳 ， 说 ， 你 与 我 同 寝 吧 。 约 瑟 把 衣 裳 丢 在 妇 人 手 里 ， 跑 到 外 边 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. \n [bbe] And pulling at his coat, she said, Come to my bed; but slipping out of his coat, he went running away. \n 39:13 [hgb] 妇 人 看 见 约 瑟 把 衣 裳 丢 在 她 手 里 跑 出 去 了 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, \n [bbe] And when she saw that he had got away, letting her keep his coat, \n 39:14 [hgb] 就 叫 了 家 里 的 人 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 看 。 他 带 了 一 个 希 伯 来 人 进 入 我 们 家 里 ， 要 戏 弄 我 们 。 他 到 我 这 里 来 ， 要 与 我 同 寝 ， 我 就 大 声 喊 叫 。 \n [kjv] That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: \n [bbe] She sent for the men of her house and said to them, See, he has let a Hebrew come here and make sport of us; he came to my bed, and I gave a loud cry; \n 39:15 [hgb] 他 听 见 我 放 声 喊 起 来 ， 就 把 衣 裳 丢 在 我 这 里 ， 跑 到 外 边 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. \n [bbe] And hearing it he went running out without his coat. \n 39:16 [hgb] 妇 人 把 约 瑟 的 衣 裳 放 在 自 己 那 里 ， 等 着 他 主 人 回 家 ， \n [kjv] And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. \n [bbe] And she kept his coat by her, till his master came back. \n 39:17 [hgb] 就 对 他 如 此 如 此 说 ， 你 所 带 到 我 们 这 里 的 那 希 伯 来 仆 人 进 来 要 戏 弄 我 ， \n [kjv] And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: \n [bbe] Then she gave him the same story, saying, The Hebrew servant whom you have taken into our house came in to make sport of me; \n 39:18 [hgb] 我 放 声 喊 起 来 ， 他 就 把 衣 裳 丢 在 我 这 里 ， 跑 出 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. \n [bbe] And when I gave a loud cry he went running out without his coat. \n 39:19 [hgb] 约 瑟 的 主 人 听 见 他 妻 子 对 他 所 说 的 话 ， 说 ， 你 的 仆 人 如 此 如 此 待 我 ， 他 就 生 气 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. \n [bbe] And hearing his wife\u0027s account of what his servant had done, he became very angry. \n 39:20 [hgb] 把 约 瑟 下 在 监 里 ， 就 是 王 的 囚 犯 被 囚 的 地 方 。 于 是 约 瑟 在 那 里 坐 监 。 \n [kjv] And Joseph\u0027s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king\u0027s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. \n [bbe] And Joseph\u0027s master took him and put him in prison, in the place where the king\u0027s prisoners were kept in chains, and he was there in the prison-house. \n 39:21 [hgb] 但 耶 和 华 与 约 瑟 同 在 ， 向 他 施 恩 ， 使 他 在 司 狱 的 眼 前 蒙 恩 。 \n [kjv] But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. \n [bbe] But the Lord was with Joseph, and was good to him, and made the keeper of the prison his friend. \n 39:22 [hgb] 司 狱 就 把 监 里 所 有 的 囚 犯 都 交 在 约 瑟 手 下 。 他 们 在 那 里 所 办 的 事 都 是 经 他 的 手 。 \n [kjv] And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph\u0027s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. \n [bbe] And the keeper of the prison put all the prisoners under Joseph\u0027s control, and he was responsible for whatever was done there. \n 39:23 [hgb] 凡 在 约 瑟 手 下 的 事 ， 司 狱 一 概 不 察 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 与 约 瑟 同 在 。 耶 和 华 使 他 所 作 的 尽 都 顺 利 。 \n [kjv] The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper. \n [bbe] And the keeper of the prison gave no attention to anything which was under his care, because the Lord was with him; and the Lord made everything he did go well. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/388.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
