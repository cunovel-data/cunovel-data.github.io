{"id":7564,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 神 记 念 挪 亚 和 挪 亚 方 舟 里 的 一 切 走 兽 牲 畜 。 神 叫 风 吹 地 ， 水 势 渐 落 。 [kjv] And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; [bbe] And God kept Noah in mind, and all the living things and the cattle which were with him in the ark: and God sent a wind over the earth, and the waters went down. 8:2 [hgb] 渊 源 和 天 上 的 窗 户 都 闭 塞 了 ， 天 上 的 大 雨 也 止 住 了 。 [kjv] The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; [bbe] And the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were shut, and the rain from heaven was stopped. 8:3 [hgb] 水 从 地 上 渐 退 。 过 了 一 百 五 十 天 ， 水 就 渐 消 。 [kjv] And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. [bbe] And the waters went slowly back from the earth, and at the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were lower. 8:4 [hgb] 七 月 十 七 日 ， 方 舟 停 在 亚 拉 腊 山 上 。 [kjv] And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. [bbe] And on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. 8:5 [hgb] 水 又 渐 消 ， 到 十 月 初 一 日 ， 山 顶 都 现 出 来 了 。 [kjv] And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. [bbe] And still the waters went on falling, till on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen. 8:6 [hgb] 过 了 四 十 天 ， 挪 亚 开 了 方 舟 的 窗 户 ， [kjv] And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: [bbe] Then, after forty days, through the open window of the ark which he had made, 8:7 [hgb] 放 出 一 只 乌 鸦 去 。 那 乌 鸦 飞 来 飞 去 ， 直 到 地 上 的 水 都 干 了 。 [kjv] And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. [bbe] Noah sent out a raven, which went this way and that till the waters were gone from the earth. 8:8 [hgb] 他 又 放 出 一 只 鸽 子 去 ， 要 看 看 水 从 地 上 退 了 没 有 。 [kjv] Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; [bbe] And he sent out a dove, to see if the waters had gone from the face of the earth; 8:9 [hgb] 但 遍 地 上 都 是 水 ， 鸽 子 找 不 着 落 脚 之 地 ， 就 回 到 方 舟 挪 亚 那 里 ， 挪 亚 伸 手 把 鸽 子 接 进 方 舟 来 。 [kjv] But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. [bbe] But the dove saw no resting-place for her foot, and came back to the ark, for the waters were still over all the earth; and he put out his hand, and took her into the ark. 8:10 [hgb] 他 又 等 了 七 天 ， 再 把 鸽 子 从 方 舟 放 出 去 。 [kjv] And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; [bbe] And after waiting another seven days, he sent the dove out again; 8:11 [hgb] 到 了 晚 上 ， 鸽 子 回 到 他 那 里 ， 嘴 里 叼 着 一 个 新 拧 下 来 的 橄 榄 叶 子 ， 挪 亚 就 知 道 地 上 的 水 退 了 。 [kjv] And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. [bbe] And the dove came back at evening, and in her mouth was an olive-leaf broken off: so Noah was certain that the waters had gone down on the earth. 8:12 [hgb] 他 又 等 了 七 天 ， 放 出 鸽 子 去 ， 鸽 子 就 不 再 回 来 了 。 [kjv] And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. [bbe] And after seven days more, he sent the dove out again, but she did not come back to him. 8:13 [hgb] 到 挪 亚 六 百 零 一 岁 ， 正 月 初 一 日 ， 地 上 的 水 都 干 了 。 挪 亚 撤 去 方 舟 的 盖 观 看 ， 便 见 地 面 上 干 了 。 [kjv] And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. [bbe] And in the six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters were dry on the earth: and Noah took the cover off the ark and saw that the face of the earth was dry. 8:14 [hgb] 到 了 二 月 二 十 七 日 ， 地 就 都 干 了 。 [kjv] And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. [bbe] And on the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was dry. 8:15 [hgb] 神 对 挪 亚 说 ， [kjv] And God spake unto Noah, saying, [bbe] And God said to Noah, 8:16 [hgb] 你 和 你 的 妻 子 ， 儿 子 ， 儿 妇 都 可 以 出 方 舟 。 [kjv] Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons\u0027 wives with thee. [bbe] Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons\u0027 wives. 8:17 [hgb] 在 你 那 里 凡 有 血 肉 的 活 物 ， 就 是 飞 鸟 ， 牲 畜 ， 和 一 切 爬 在 地 上 的 昆 虫 ， 都 要 带 出 来 ， 叫 它 在 地 上 多 多 滋 生 ， 大 大 兴 旺 。 [kjv] Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. [bbe] Take out with you every living thing which is with you, birds and cattle and everything which goes on the earth, so that they may have offspring and be fertile and be increased on the earth. 8:18 [hgb] 于 是 挪 亚 和 他 的 妻 子 ， 儿 子 ， 儿 妇 ， 都 出 来 了 。 [kjv] And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons\u0027 wives with him: [bbe] And Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons\u0027 wives; 8:19 [hgb] 一 切 走 兽 ， 昆 虫 ， 飞 鸟 ， 和 地 上 所 有 的 动 物 ， 各 从 其 类 ， 也 都 出 了 方 舟 。 [kjv] Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. [bbe] And every beast and bird and every living thing of every sort which goes on the earth, went out of the ark. 8:20 [hgb] 挪 亚 为 耶 和 华 筑 了 一 座 坛 ， 拿 各 类 洁 净 的 牲 畜 ， 飞 鸟 献 在 坛 上 为 燔 祭 。 [kjv] And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. [bbe] And Noah made an altar to the Lord, and from every clean beast and bird he made burned offerings on the altar. 8:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 闻 那 馨 香 之 气 ， 就 心 里 说 ， 我 不 再 因 人 的 缘 故 咒 诅 地 （ 人 从 小 时 心 里 怀 着 恶 念 ） ， 也 不 再 按 着 我 才 行 的 ， 灭 各 种 的 活 物 了 。 [kjv] And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man\u0027s sake; for the imagination of man\u0027s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. [bbe] And when the sweet smell came up to the Lord, he said in his heart, I will not again put a curse on the earth because of man, for the thoughts of man\u0027s heart are evil from his earliest days; never again will I send destruction on all living things as I have done. 8:22 [hgb] 地 还 存 留 的 时 候 ， 稼 穑 ， 寒 暑 ， 冬 夏 ， 昼 夜 就 永 不 停 息 了 。 [kjv] While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. [bbe] While the earth goes on, seed time and the getting in of the grain, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, will not come to an end.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/357.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
