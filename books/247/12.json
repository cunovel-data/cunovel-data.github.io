And the Canaanite was then in the land. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abram went through the land till he came to Shechem, to the holy tree of Moreh. At that time, the Canaanites were still living in the land. \\n\\n 12:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 向 亚 伯 兰 显 现 ， 说 ， 我 要 把 这 地 赐 给 你 的 后 裔 。 亚 伯 兰 就 在 那 里 为 向 他 显 现 的 耶 和 华 筑 了 一 座 坛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord came to Abram, and said, I will give all this land to your seed; then Abram made an altar there to the Lord who had let himself be seen by him. \\n\\n 12:8 [hgb] 从 那 里 他 又 迁 到 伯 特 利 东 边 的 山 ， 支 搭 帐 棚 。 西 边 是 伯 特 利 ， 东 边 是 艾 。 他 在 那 里 又 为 耶 和 华 筑 了 一 座 坛 ， 求 告 耶 和 华 的 名 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] And moving on from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-el, he put up his tent, having Beth-el on the west and Ai on the east: and there he made an altar and gave worship to the name of the Lord. \\n\\n 12:9 [hgb] 后 来 亚 伯 兰 又 渐 渐 迁 往 南 地 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. \\n\\n [bbe] And he went on, journeying still to the South. \\n\\n 12:10 [hgb] 那 地 遭 遇 饥 荒 。 因 饥 荒 甚 大 ， 亚 伯 兰 就 下 埃 及 去 ， 要 在 那 里 暂 居 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. \\n\\n [bbe] And because there was little food to be had in that land, he went down into Egypt. \\n\\n 12:11 [hgb] 将 近 埃 及 ， 就 对 他 妻 子 撒 莱 说 ， 我 知 道 你 是 容 貌 俊 美 的 妇 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: \\n\\n [bbe] Now when he came near to Egypt, he said to Sarai, his wife, Truly, you are a fair woman and beautiful to the eye; \\n\\n 12:12 [hgb] 埃 及 人 看 见 你 必 说 ， 这 是 他 的 妻 子 ， 他 们 就 要 杀 我 ， 却 叫 你 存 活 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. \\n\\n [bbe] And I am certain that when the men of Egypt see you, they will say, This is his wife: and they will put me to death and keep you. \\n\\n 12:13 [hgb] 求 你 说 ， 你 是 我 的 妹 子 ， 使 我 因 你 得 平 安 ， 我 的 命 也 因 你 存 活 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. \\n\\n [bbe] Say, then, that you are my sister, and so it will be well with me because of you, and my life will be kept safe on your account. \\n\\n 12:14 [hgb] 及 至 亚 伯 兰 到 了 埃 及 ， 埃 及 人 看 见 那 妇 人 极 其 美 貌 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. \\n\\n [bbe] And so it was that when Abram came into Egypt, the men of Egypt, looking on the woman, saw that she was fair. \\n\\n 12:15 [hgb] 法 老 的 臣 宰 看 见 了 她 ， 就 在 法 老 面 前 夸 奖 她 。 那 妇 人 就 被 带 进 法 老 的 宫 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh\u0027s house. \\n\\n [bbe] And Pharaoh\u0027s great men, having seen her, said words in praise of her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh\u0027s house. \\n\\n 12:16 [hgb] 法 老 因 这 妇 人 就 厚 待 亚 伯 兰 ， 亚 伯 兰 得 了 许 多 牛 ， 羊 ， 骆 驼 ， 公 驴 ， 母 驴 ， 仆 婢 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. \\n\\n [bbe] And because of her, he was good to Abram, and he had sheep and oxen and asses, and men-servants and women-servants, and camels. \\n\\n 12:17 [hgb] 耶 和 华 因 亚 伯 兰 妻 子 撒 莱 的 缘 故 ， 降 大 灾 与 法 老 和 他 的 全 家 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram\u0027s wife. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord sent great troubles on Pharaoh\u0027s house because of Sarai, Abram\u0027s wife. \\n\\n 12:18 [hgb] 法 老 就 召 了 亚 伯 兰 来 ， 说 ， 你 这 向 我 作 的 是 什 么 事 呢 ？ 为 什 么 没 有 告 诉 我 她 是 你 的 妻 子 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? \\n\\n [bbe] Then Pharaoh sent for Abram, and said, What have you done to me? why did you not say that she was your wife? \\n\\n 12:19 [hgb] 为 什 么 说 她 是 你 的 妹 子 ， 以 致 我 把 她 取 来 要 作 我 的 妻 子 ？ 现 在 你 的 妻 子 在 这 里 ， 可 以 带 她 走 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. \\n\\n [bbe] Why did you say that she was your sister? so that I took her for my wife: now, take your wife and go on your way. \\n\\n 12:20 [hgb] 于 是 法 老 吩 咐 人 将 亚 伯 兰 和 他 妻 子 ， 并 他 所 有 的 都 送 走 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/361.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
