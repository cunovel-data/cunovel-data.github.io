{"id":7572,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"16:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 兰 的 妻 子 撒 莱 不 给 他 生 儿 女 。 撒 莱 有 一 个 使 女 ， 名 叫 夏 甲 ， 是 埃 及 人 。 [kjv] Now Sarai Abram\u0027s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. [bbe] Now Sarai, Abram\u0027s wife, had given him no children; and she had a servant, a woman of Egypt whose name was Hagar. 16:2 [hgb] 撒 莱 对 亚 伯 兰 说 ， 耶 和 华 使 我 不 能 生 育 。 求 你 和 我 的 使 女 同 房 ， 或 者 我 可 以 因 她 得 孩 子 （ 得 孩 子 原 文 作 被 建 立 ） 。 亚 伯 兰 听 从 了 撒 莱 的 话 。 [kjv] And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. [bbe] And Sarai said to Abram, See, the Lord has not let me have children; go in to my servant, for I may get a family through her. And Abram did as Sarai said. 16:3 [hgb] 于 是 亚 伯 兰 的 妻 子 撒 莱 将 使 女 埃 及 人 夏 甲 给 了 丈 夫 为 妾 。 那 时 亚 伯 兰 在 迦 南 已 经 住 了 十 年 。 [kjv] And Sarai Abram\u0027s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. [bbe] So after Abram had been living for ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian servant, and gave her to Abram for his wife. 16:4 [hgb] 亚 伯 兰 与 夏 甲 同 房 ， 夏 甲 就 怀 了 孕 。 她 见 自 己 有 孕 ， 就 小 看 她 的 主 母 。 [kjv] And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. [bbe] And he went in to Hagar and she became with child, and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for her master\u0027s wife. 16:5 [hgb] 撒 莱 对 亚 伯 兰 说 ， 我 因 你 受 屈 。 我 将 我 的 使 女 放 在 你 怀 中 ， 她 见 自 己 有 了 孕 ， 就 小 看 我 。 愿 耶 和 华 在 你 我 中 间 判 断 。 [kjv] And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee. [bbe] And Sarai said to Abram, May my wrong be on you: I gave you my servant for your wife and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for me: may the Lord be judge between you and me. 16:6 [hgb] 亚 伯 兰 对 撒 莱 说 ， 使 女 在 你 手 下 ， 你 可 以 随 意 待 她 。 撒 莱 苦 待 她 ， 她 就 从 撒 莱 面 前 逃 走 了 。 [kjv] But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. [bbe] And Abram said, The woman is in your power; do with her whatever seems good to you. And Sarai was cruel to her, so that she went running away from her. 16:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 在 旷 野 书 珥 路 上 的 水 泉 旁 遇 见 她 ， [kjv] And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. [bbe] And an angel of the Lord came to her by a fountain of water in the waste land, by the fountain on the way to Shur. 16:8 [hgb] 对 她 说 ， 撒 莱 的 使 女 夏 甲 ， 你 从 哪 里 来 ， 要 往 哪 里 去 。 夏 甲 说 ， 我 从 我 的 主 母 撒 莱 面 前 逃 出 来 。 [kjv] And he said, Hagar, Sarai\u0027s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. [bbe] And he said, Hagar, Sarai\u0027s servant, where have you come from and where are you going? And she said, I am running away from Sarai, my master\u0027s wife. 16:9 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 对 她 说 ， 你 回 到 你 主 母 那 里 ， 服 在 她 手 下 。 [kjv] And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. [bbe] And the angel said to her, Go back, and put yourself under her authority. 16:10 [hgb] 又 说 ， 我 必 使 你 的 后 裔 极 其 繁 多 ， 甚 至 不 可 胜 数 。 [kjv] And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude. [bbe] And the angel of the Lord said, Your seed will be greatly increased so that it may not be numbered. 16:11 [hgb] 并 说 ， 你 如 今 怀 孕 要 生 一 个 儿 子 ， 可 以 给 他 起 名 叫 以 实 玛 利 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 听 见 了 你 的 苦 情 。 （ 以 实 玛 利 就 是 神 听 见 的 意 思 ） [kjv] And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. [bbe] And the angel of the Lord said, See, you are with child and will give birth to a son, to whom you will give the name Ishmael, because the ears of the Lord were open to your sorrow. 16:12 [hgb] 他 为 人 必 像 野 驴 。 他 的 手 要 攻 打 人 ， 人 的 手 也 要 攻 打 他 。 他 必 住 在 众 弟 兄 的 东 边 。 [kjv] And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man\u0027s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. [bbe] And he will be like a mountain ass among men; his hand will be against every man and every man\u0027s hand against him, and he will keep his place against all his brothers. 16:13 [hgb] 夏 甲 就 称 那 对 她 说 话 的 耶 和 华 为 看 顾 人 的 神 。 因 而 说 ， 在 这 里 我 也 看 见 那 看 顾 我 的 吗 ？ [kjv] And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? [bbe] And to the Lord who was talking with her she gave this name, You are a God who is seen; for she said, Have I not even here in the waste land had a vision of God and am still living? 16:14 [hgb] 所 以 这 井 名 叫 庇 耳 拉 海 莱 。 这 井 正 在 加 低 斯 和 巴 列 中 间 。 [kjv] Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. [bbe] So that fountain was named, Fountain of Life and Vision: it is between Kadesh and Bered. 16:15 [hgb] 后 来 夏 甲 给 亚 伯 兰 生 了 一 个 儿 子 。 亚 伯 兰 给 他 起 名 叫 以 实 玛 利 。 [kjv] And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son\u0027s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael. [bbe] And Hagar gave birth to a child, the son of Abram, to whom Abram gave the name of Ishmael. 16:16 [hgb] 夏 甲 给 亚 伯 兰 生 以 实 玛 利 的 时 候 ， 亚 伯 兰 年 八 十 六 岁 。 [kjv] And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram. [bbe] Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/365.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
