And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? \\n\\n [bbe] Now the snake was wiser than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, Has God truly said that you may not take of the fruit of any tree in the garden? \\n\\n 3:2 [hgb] 女 人 对 蛇 说 ， 园 中 树 上 的 果 子 ， 我 们 可 以 吃 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: \\n\\n [bbe] And the woman said, We may take of the fruit of the trees in the garden: \\n\\n 3:3 [hgb] 惟 有 园 当 中 那 棵 树 上 的 果 子 ， 神 曾 说 ， 你 们 不 可 吃 ， 也 不 可 摸 ， 免 得 你 们 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. \\n\\n [bbe] But of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, If you take of it or put your hands on it, death will come to you. \\n\\n 3:4 [hgb] 蛇 对 女 人 说 ， 你 们 不 一 定 死 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: \\n\\n [bbe] And the snake said, Death will not certainly come to you: \\n\\n 3:5 [hgb] 因 为 神 知 道 ， 你 们 吃 的 日 子 眼 睛 就 明 亮 了 ， 你 们 便 如 神 能 知 道 善 恶 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. \\n\\n [bbe] For God sees that on the day when you take of its fruit, your eyes will be open, and you will be as gods, having knowledge of good and evil. \\n\\n 3:6 [hgb] 于 是 女 人 见 那 棵 树 的 果 子 好 作 食 物 ， 也 悦 人 的 眼 目 ， 且 是 可 喜 爱 的 ， 能 使 人 有 智 慧 ， 就 摘 下 果 子 来 吃 了 。 又 给 她 丈 夫 ， 她 丈 夫 也 吃 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and a delight to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and gave it to her husband. \\n\\n 3:7 [hgb] 他 们 二 人 的 眼 睛 就 明 亮 了 ， 才 知 道 自 己 是 赤 身 露 体 ， 便 拿 无 花 果 树 的 叶 子 ， 为 自 己 编 作 裙 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. \\n\\n [bbe] And their eyes were open and they were conscious that they had no clothing and they made themselves coats of leaves stitched together. \\n\\n 3:8 [hgb] 天 起 了 凉 风 ， 耶 和 华 神 在 园 中 行 走 。 那 人 和 他 妻 子 听 见 神 的 声 音 ， 就 藏 在 园 里 的 树 木 中 ， 躲 避 耶 和 华 神 的 面 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. \\n\\n [bbe] And there came to them the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening wind: and the man and his wife went to a secret place among the trees of the garden, away from the eyes of the Lord God. \\n\\n 3:9 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 呼 唤 那 人 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 在 哪 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? \\n\\n [bbe] And the voice of the Lord God came to the man, saying, Where are you? \\n\\n 3:10 [hgb] 他 说 ， 我 在 园 中 听 见 你 的 声 音 ， 我 就 害 怕 。 因 为 我 赤 身 露 体 ， 我 便 藏 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, Hearing your voice in the garden I was full of fear, because I was without clothing: and I kept myself from your eyes. \\n\\n 3:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 谁 告 诉 你 赤 身 露 体 呢 ？ 莫 非 你 吃 了 我 吩 咐 你 不 可 吃 的 那 树 上 的 果 子 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, Who gave you the knowledge that you were without clothing? Have you taken of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take? \\n\\n 3:12 [hgb] 那 人 说 ， 你 所 赐 给 我 ， 与 我 同 居 的 女 人 ， 她 把 那 树 上 的 果 子 给 我 ， 我 就 吃 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. \\n\\n [bbe] And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me the fruit of the tree and I took it. \\n\\n 3:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 对 女 人 说 ， 你 作 的 是 什 么 事 呢 ？ 女 人 说 ， 那 蛇 引 诱 我 ， 我 就 吃 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord God said to the woman, What have you done? And the woman said, I was tricked by the deceit of the snake and I took it. \\n\\n 3:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 对 蛇 说 ， 你 既 作 了 这 事 ， 就 必 受 咒 诅 ， 比 一 切 的 牲 畜 野 兽 更 甚 。 你 必 用 肚 子 行 走 ， 终 身 吃 土 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord God said to the snake, Because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and every beast of the field; you will go flat on the earth, and dust will be your food all the days of your life: \\n\\n 3:15 [hgb] 我 又 要 叫 你 和 女 人 彼 此 为 仇 。 你 的 后 裔 和 女 人 的 后 裔 也 彼 此 为 仇 。 女 人 的 后 裔 要 伤 你 的 头 ， 你 要 伤 他 的 脚 跟 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. \\n\\n [bbe] And there will be war between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed: by him will your head be crushed and by you his foot will be wounded. \\n\\n 3:16 [hgb] 又 对 女 人 说 ， 我 必 多 多 加 增 你 怀 胎 的 苦 楚 ， 你 生 产 儿 女 必 多 受 苦 楚 。 你 必 恋 慕 你 丈 夫 ， 你 丈 夫 必 管 辖 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. \\n\\n [bbe] To the woman he said, Great will be your pain in childbirth; in sorrow will your children come to birth; still your desire will be for your husband, but he will be your master. \\n\\n 3:17 [hgb] 又 对 亚 当 说 ， 你 既 听 从 妻 子 的 话 ， 吃 了 我 所 吩 咐 你 不 可 吃 的 那 树 上 的 果 子 ， 地 必 为 你 的 缘 故 受 咒 诅 。 你 必 终 身 劳 苦 ， 才 能 从 地 里 得 吃 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; \\n\\n [bbe] And to Adam he said, Because you gave ear to the voice of your wife and took of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take, the earth is cursed on your account; in pain you will get your food from it all your life. \\n\\n 3:18 [hgb] 地 必 给 你 长 出 荆 棘 和 蒺 藜 来 ， 你 也 要 吃 田 间 的 菜 蔬 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; \\n\\n [bbe] Thorns and waste plants will come up, and the plants of the field will be your food; \\n\\n 3:19 [hgb] 你 必 汗 流 满 面 才 得 糊 口 ， 直 到 你 归 了 土 ， 因 为 你 是 从 土 而 出 的 。 你 本 是 尘 土 ， 仍 要 归 于 尘 土 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. \\n\\n [bbe] With the hard work of your hands you will get your bread till you go back to the earth from which you were taken: for dust you are and to the dust you will go back. \\n\\n 3:20 [hgb] 亚 当 给 他 妻 子 起 名 叫 夏 娃 ， 因 为 她 是 众 生 之 母 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Adam called his wife\u0027s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. \\n\\n [bbe] And the man gave his wife the name of Eve because she was the mother of all who have life. \\n\\n 3:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 为 亚 当 和 他 妻 子 用 皮 子 作 衣 服 给 他 们 穿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins for their clothing. \\n\\n 3:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 说 ， 那 人 已 经 与 我 们 相 似 ， 能 知 道 善 恶 。 现 在 恐 怕 他 伸 手 又 摘 生 命 树 的 果 子 吃 ， 就 永 远 活 着 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord God said, Now the man has become like one of us, having knowledge of good and evil; and now if he puts out his hand and takes of the fruit of the tree of life, he will go on living for ever. \\n\\n 3:23 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 便 打 发 他 出 伊 甸 园 去 ， 耕 种 他 所 自 出 之 土 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. \\n\\n [bbe] So the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to be a worker on the earth from which he was taken. \\n\\n 3:24 [hgb] 于 是 把 他 赶 出 去 了 。 又 在 伊 甸 园 的 东 边 安 设 基 路 伯 和 四 面 转 动 发 火 焰 的 剑 ， 要 把 守 生 命 树 的 道 路 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. \\n\\n [bbe] So he sent the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden he put winged ones and a flaming sword turning every way to keep the way to the tree of life. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/317.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
