And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. \n [bbe] And they said one to another, Come, let us make bricks, burning them well. And they had bricks for stone, putting them together with sticky earth. \n 11:4 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 来 吧 ， 我 们 要 建 造 一 座 城 和 一 座 塔 ， 塔 顶 通 天 ， 为 要 传 扬 我 们 的 名 ， 免 得 我 们 分 散 在 全 地 上 。 \n [kjv] And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. \n [bbe] And they said, Come, let us make a town, and a tower whose top will go up as high as heaven; and let us make a great name for ourselves, so that we may not be wanderers over the face of the earth. \n 11:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 降 临 ， 要 看 看 世 人 所 建 造 的 城 和 塔 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. \n [bbe] And the Lord came down to see the town and the tower which the children of men were building. \n 11:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 看 哪 ， 他 们 成 为 一 样 的 人 民 ， 都 是 一 样 的 言 语 ， 如 今 既 作 起 这 事 来 ， 以 后 他 们 所 要 作 的 事 就 没 有 不 成 就 的 了 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. \n [bbe] And the Lord said, See, they are all one people and have all one language; and this is only the start of what they may do: and now it will not be possible to keep them from any purpose of theirs. \n 11:7 [hgb] 我 们 下 去 ， 在 那 里 变 乱 他 们 的 口 音 ， 使 他 们 的 言 语 彼 此 不 通 。 \n [kjv] Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another\u0027s speech. \n [bbe] Come, let us go down and take away the sense of their language, so that they will not be able to make themselves clear to one another. \n 11:8 [hgb] 于 是 ， 耶 和 华 使 他 们 从 那 里 分 散 在 全 地 上 。 他 们 就 停 工 ， 不 造 那 城 了 。 \n [kjv] So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. \n [bbe] So the Lord God sent them away into every part of the earth: and they gave up building their town. \n 11:9 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 在 那 里 变 乱 天 下 人 的 言 语 ， 使 众 人 分 散 在 全 地 上 ， 所 以 那 城 名 叫 巴 别 （ 就 是 变 乱 的 意 思 ） 。 \n [kjv] Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. \n [bbe] So it was named Babel, because there the Lord took away the sense of all languages and from there the Lord sent them away over all the face of the earth. \n 11:10 [hgb] 闪 的 后 代 记 在 下 面 。 洪 水 以 后 二 年 ， 闪 一 百 岁 生 了 亚 法 撒 。 \n [kjv] These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: \n [bbe] These are the generations of Shem.
