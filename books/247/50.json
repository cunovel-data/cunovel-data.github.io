Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. \\n\\n [bbe] My father made me take an oath, saying, When I am dead, put me to rest in the place I have made ready for myself in the land of Canaan. So now let me go and put my father in his last resting-place, and I will come back again. \\n\\n 50:6 [hgb] 法 老 说 ， 你 可 以 上 去 ， 照 着 你 父 亲 叫 你 起 的 誓 ， 将 他 葬 埋 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. \\n\\n [bbe] And Pharaoh said, Go up and put your father to rest, as you gave your oath to him. \\n\\n 50:7 [hgb] 于 是 约 瑟 上 去 葬 他 父 亲 。 与 他 一 同 上 去 的 ， 有 法 老 的 臣 仆 和 法 老 家 中 的 长 老 ， 并 埃 及 国 的 长 老 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, \\n\\n [bbe] So Joseph went up to put his father in his last resting-place; and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, and the chief men of his house and all the chiefs of the land of Egypt, \\n\\n 50:8 [hgb] 还 有 约 瑟 的 全 家 和 他 的 弟 兄 们 ， 并 他 父 亲 的 眷 属 。 只 有 他 们 的 妇 人 孩 子 ， 和 羊 群 牛 群 ， 都 留 在 歌 珊 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father\u0027s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. \\n\\n [bbe] And all the family of Joseph, and his brothers and his father\u0027s people: only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of Goshen. \\n\\n 50:9 [hgb] 又 有 车 辆 马 兵 ， 和 他 一 同 上 去 。 那 一 帮 人 甚 多 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. \\n\\n [bbe] And carriages went up with him and horsemen, a great army. \\n\\n 50:10 [hgb] 他 们 到 了 约 但 河 外 ， 亚 达 的 禾 场 ， 就 在 那 里 大 大 地 号 啕 痛 哭 。 约 瑟 为 他 父 亲 哀 哭 了 七 天 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. \\n\\n [bbe] And they came to the grain-floor of Atad on the other side of Jordan, and there they gave the last honours to Jacob, with great and bitter sorrow, weeping for their father for seven days. \\n\\n 50:11 [hgb] 迦 南 的 居 民 见 亚 达 禾 场 上 的 哀 哭 ， 就 说 ， 这 是 埃 及 人 一 场 大 的 哀 哭 。 因 此 那 地 方 名 叫 亚 伯 麦 西 ， 是 在 约 但 河 东 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the people of the land, the people of Canaan, at the grain-floor of Atad, saw their grief, they said, Great is the grief of the Egyptians: so the place was named Abel-mizraim, on the other side of Jordan. \\n\\n 50:12 [hgb] 雅 各 的 儿 子 们 就 遵 着 他 父 亲 所 吩 咐 的 办 了 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: \\n\\n [bbe] So his sons did as he had given them orders to do: \\n\\n 50:13 [hgb] 把 他 搬 到 迦 南 地 ， 葬 在 幔 利 前 ， 麦 比 拉 田 间 的 洞 里 。 那 洞 和 田 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 向 赫 人 以 弗 仑 买 来 为 业 ， 作 坟 地 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. \\n\\n [bbe] For they took him into the land of Canaan and put him to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah, which Abraham got with the field, for a resting-place, from Ephron the Hittite at Mamre. \\n\\n 50:14 [hgb] 约 瑟 葬 了 他 父 亲 以 后 ， 就 和 众 弟 兄 ， 并 一 切 同 他 上 去 葬 他 父 亲 的 人 ， 都 回 埃 及 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. \\n\\n [bbe] And when his father had been put to rest, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone with him, went back to Egypt. \\n\\n 50:15 [hgb] 约 瑟 的 哥 哥 们 见 父 亲 死 了 ， 就 说 ， 或 者 约 瑟 怀 恨 我 们 ， 照 着 我 们 从 前 待 他 一 切 的 恶 足 足 地 报 复 我 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Joseph\u0027s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. \\n\\n [bbe] Now after the death of their father, Joseph\u0027s brothers said to themselves, It may be that Joseph\u0027s heart will be turned against us, and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him. \\n\\n 50:16 [hgb] 他 们 就 打 发 人 去 见 约 瑟 ， 说 ， 你 父 亲 未 死 以 先 吩 咐 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, \\n\\n [bbe] So they sent word to Joseph, saying, Your father, before his death, gave us orders, saying, \\n\\n 50:17 [hgb] 你 们 要 对 约 瑟 这 样 说 ， 从 前 你 哥 哥 们 恶 待 你 ， 求 你 饶 恕 他 们 的 过 犯 和 罪 恶 。 如 今 求 你 饶 恕 你 父 亲 神 之 仆 人 的 过 犯 。 他 们 对 约 瑟 说 这 话 ， 约 瑟 就 哭 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. \\n\\n [bbe] You are to say to Joseph, Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked, and the evil they did to you: now, if it is your pleasure, let the sin of the servants of your father\u0027s God have forgiveness. And at these words, Joseph was overcome with weeping. \\n\\n 50:18 [hgb] 他 的 哥 哥 们 又 来 俯 伏 在 他 面 前 ， 说 ， 我 们 是 你 的 仆 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. \\n\\n [bbe] Then his brothers went, and falling at his feet, said, Truly, we are your servants. \\n\\n 50:19 [hgb] 约 瑟 对 他 们 说 ， 不 要 害 怕 ， 我 岂 能 代 替 神 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? \\n\\n [bbe] And Joseph said, Have no fear: am I in the place of God? \\n\\n 50:20 [hgb] 从 前 你 们 的 意 思 是 要 害 我 ， 但 神 的 意 思 原 是 好 的 ， 要 保 全 许 多 人 的 性 命 ， 成 就 今 日 的 光 景 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. \\n\\n [bbe] As for you, it was in your mind to do me evil, but God has given a happy outcome, the salvation of numbers of people, as you see today. \\n\\n 50:21 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 不 要 害 怕 ， 我 必 养 活 你 们 和 你 们 的 妇 人 孩 子 。 于 是 约 瑟 用 亲 爱 的 话 安 慰 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] So now, have no fear: for I will take care of you and your little ones. So he gave them comfort with kind words. \\n\\n 50:22 [hgb] 约 瑟 和 他 父 亲 的 眷 属 都 住 在 埃 及 。 约 瑟 活 了 一 百 一 十 岁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father\u0027s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. \\n\\n [bbe] Now Joseph and all his father\u0027s family went on living in Egypt: and the years of Joseph\u0027s life were a hundred and ten. \\n\\n 50:23 [hgb] 约 瑟 得 见 以 法 莲 第 三 代 的 子 孙 。 玛 拿 西 的 孙 子 ， 玛 吉 的 儿 子 也 养 在 约 瑟 的 膝 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joseph saw Ephraim\u0027s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph\u0027s knees. \\n\\n [bbe] And Joseph saw Ephraim\u0027s children of the third generation: and the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, came to birth on Joseph\u0027s knees. \\n\\n 50:24 [hgb] 约 瑟 对 他 弟 兄 们 说 ， 我 要 死 了 ， 但 神 必 定 看 顾 你 们 ， 领 你 们 从 这 地 上 去 ， 到 他 起 誓 所 应 许 给 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 以 撒 ， 雅 各 之 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Joseph said to his brothers, The time of my death has come; but God will keep you in mind and take you out of this land into the land which he gave by his oath to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. \\n\\n 50:25 [hgb] 约 瑟 叫 以 色 列 的 子 孙 起 誓 说 ， 神 必 定 看 顾 你 们 。 你 们 要 把 我 的 骸 骨 从 这 里 搬 上 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Joseph made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, God will certainly give effect to his word, and you are to take my bones away from here. \\n\\n 50:26 [hgb] 约 瑟 死 了 ， 正 一 百 一 十 岁 。 人 用 香 料 将 他 薰 了 ， 把 他 收 殓 在 棺 材 里 ， 停 在 埃 及 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt. \\n\\n [bbe] So Joseph came to his death, being a hundred and ten years old: and they made his body ready, and he was put in a chest in Egypt. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/399.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
