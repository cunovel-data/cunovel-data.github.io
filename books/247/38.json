And Tamar went and dwelt in her father\u0027s house. \n [bbe] Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, Go back to your father\u0027s house and keep yourself as a widow till my son Shelah becomes a man: for he had in his mind the thought that death might come to him as it had come to his brothers. So Tamar went back to her father\u0027s house. \n 38:12 [hgb] 过 了 许 久 ， 犹 大 的 妻 子 书 亚 的 女 儿 死 了 。 犹 大 得 了 安 慰 ， 就 和 他 朋 友 亚 杜 兰 人 希 拉 上 亭 拿 去 ， 到 他 剪 羊 毛 的 人 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah\u0027s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. \n [bbe] And after a time, Bath-shua, Judah\u0027s wife, came to her end; and after Judah was comforted for her loss, he went to Timnah, where they were cutting the wool of his sheep, and his friend Hirah of Adullam went with him. \n 38:13 [hgb] 有 人 告 诉 他 玛 说 ， 你 的 公 公 上 亭 拿 剪 羊 毛 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. \n [bbe] And when Tamar had news that her father-in-law was going up to Timnah to the wool-cutting, \n 38:14 [hgb] 他 玛 见 示 拉 已 经 长 大 ， 还 没 有 娶 她 为 妻 ， 就 脱 了 她 作 寡 妇 的 衣 裳 ， 用 帕 子 蒙 着 脸 ， 又 遮 住 身 体 ， 坐 在 亭 拿 路 上 的 伊 拿 印 城 门 口 。 \n [kjv] And she put her widow\u0027s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. \n [bbe] She took off her widow\u0027s clothing, and covering herself with her veil, she took her seat near Enaim on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was now a man, but she had not been made his wife. \n 38:15 [hgb] 犹 大 看 见 她 ， 以 为 是 妓 女 ， 因 为 她 蒙 着 脸 。 \n [kjv] When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. \n [bbe] When Judah saw her he took her to be a loose woman of the town, because her face was covered. \n 38:16 [hgb] 犹 大 就 转 到 她 那 里 去 ， 说 ， 来 吧 。 让 我 与 你 同 寝 。 他 原 不 知 道 是 他 的 儿 妇 。 他 玛 说 ， 你 要 与 我 同 寝 ， 把 什 么 给 我 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? \n [bbe] And turning to her by the roadside, he said to her, Let me come in to you; for he had no idea that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me as my price? \n 38:17 [hgb] 犹 大 说 ， 我 从 羊 群 里 取 一 只 山 羊 羔 ， 打 发 人 送 来 给 你 。 他 玛 说 ， 在 未 送 以 先 ， 你 愿 意 给 我 一 个 当 头 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? \n [bbe] And he said, I will give you a young goat from the flock. And she said, What will you give me as a sign till you send it? \n 38:18 [hgb] 他 说 ， 我 给 你 什 么 当 头 呢 ？ 他 玛 说 ， 你 的 印 ， 你 的 带 子 ， 和 你 手 里 的 杖 。 犹 大 就 给 了 她 ， 与 她 同 寝 ， 她 就 从 犹 大 怀 了 孕 。 \n [kjv] And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. \n [bbe] And he said, What would you have? And she said, Your ring and its cord and the stick in your hand. So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she became with child by him. \n 38:19 [hgb] 他 玛 起 来 走 了 ， 除 去 帕 子 ， 仍 旧 穿 上 作 寡 妇 的 衣 裳 。 \n [kjv] And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. \n [bbe] Then she got up and went away and took off her veil and put on her widow\u0027s clothing. \n 38:20 [hgb] 犹 大 托 他 朋 友 亚 杜 兰 人 送 一 只 山 羊 羔 去 ， 要 从 那 女 人 手 里 取 回 当 头 来 ， 却 找 不 着 她 。 \n [kjv] And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman\u0027s hand: but he found her not. \n [bbe] Then Judah sent his friend Hirah with the young goat, to get back the things which he had given as a sign to the woman: but she was not there. \n 38:21 [hgb] 就 问 那 地 方 的 人 说 ， 伊 拿 印 路 旁 的 妓 女 在 哪 里 ， 他 们 说 ， 这 里 并 没 有 妓 女 。 \n [kjv] Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. \n [bbe] And he put questions to the men of the place, saying, Where is the loose woman who was in Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There was no such woman there. \n 38:22 [hgb] 他 回 去 见 犹 大 说 ， 我 没 有 找 着 她 ， 并 且 那 地 方 的 人 说 ， 这 里 没 有 妓 女 。 \n [kjv] And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place. \n [bbe] So he went back to Judah, and said, I have not seen her, and the men of the place say that there is no such woman there. \n 38:23 [hgb] 犹 大 说 ， 我 把 这 山 羊 羔 送 去 了 ， 你 竟 找 不 着 她 。 任 凭 她 拿 去 吧 ， 免 得 我 们 被 羞 辱 。 \n [kjv] And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. \n [bbe] And Judah said, Let her keep the things, so that we may not be shamed; I sent the young goat, but you did not see the woman. \n 38:24 [hgb] 约 过 了 三 个 月 ， 有 人 告 诉 犹 大 说 ， 你 的 儿 妇 他 玛 作 了 妓 女 ， 且 因 行 淫 有 了 身 孕 。 犹 大 说 ， 拉 出 她 来 ， 把 她 烧 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. \n [bbe] Now about three months after this, word came to Judah that Tamar, his daughter-in-law, had been acting like a loose woman and was with child. And Judah said, Take her out and let her be burned. \n 38:25 [hgb] 他 玛 被 拉 出 来 的 时 候 便 打 发 人 去 见 她 公 公 ， 对 他 说 ， 这 些 东 西 是 谁 的 ， 我 就 是 从 谁 怀 的 孕 。 请 你 认 一 认 ， 这 印 和 带 子 并 杖 都 是 谁 的 ， \n [kjv] When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff. \n [bbe] And while she was being taken out, she sent word to her father-in-law, saying, The man whose property these things are, is the father of my child: say then, whose are this ring and this cord and this stick? \n 38:26 [hgb] 犹 大 承 认 说 ， 她 比 我 更 有 义 ， 因 为 我 没 有 将 她 给 我 的 儿 子 示 拉 。 从 此 犹 大 不 再 与 她 同 寝 了 。 \n [kjv] And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. \n [bbe] Then Judah said openly that they were his, and said, She is more upright than I am, for I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he had no more connection with her. \n 38:27 [hgb] 他 玛 将 要 生 产 ， 不 料 她 腹 里 是 一 对 双 生 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. \n [bbe] And when the time came for her to give birth, it was clear that there were two children in her body. \n 38:28 [hgb] 到 生 产 的 时 候 ， 一 个 孩 子 伸 出 一 只 手 来 。 收 生 婆 拿 红 线 拴 在 他 手 上 ， 说 ， 这 是 头 生 的 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. \n [bbe] And while she was in the act of giving birth, one of them put out his hand; and the woman who was with her put a red thread round his hand, saying, This one came out first. \n 38:29 [hgb] 随 后 这 孩 子 把 手 收 回 去 ， 他 哥 哥 生 出 来 了 。 收 生 婆 说 ， 你 为 什 么 抢 着 来 呢 ？ 因 此 给 他 起 名 叫 法 勒 斯 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. \n [bbe] But then he took his hand back again, and his brother came first to birth: and the woman said, What an opening you have made for yourself! So he was named Perez. \n 38:30 [hgb] 后 来 ， 他 兄 弟 那 手 上 有 红 线 的 也 生 出 来 ， 就 给 他 起 名 叫 谢 拉 。 \n [kjv] And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah. \n [bbe] And then his brother came out, with the red thread round his hand, and he was named Zerah. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/387.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
