{"id":7582,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"26:1 [hgb] 在 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 日 子 ， 那 地 有 一 次 饥 荒 。 这 时 又 有 饥 荒 ， 以 撒 就 往 基 拉 耳 去 ， 到 非 利 士 人 的 王 亚 比 米 勒 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. \n [bbe] Then came a time of great need in the land, like that which had been before in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar. \n 26:2 [hgb] 耶 和 华 向 以 撒 显 现 ， 说 ， 你 不 要 下 埃 及 去 ， 要 住 在 我 所 指 示 你 的 地 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: \n [bbe] And the Lord came to him in a vision and said, Do not go down to Egypt; keep in the land of which I will give you knowledge: \n 26:3 [hgb] 你 寄 居 在 这 地 ， 我 必 与 你 同 在 ， 赐 福 给 你 ， 因 为 我 要 将 这 些 地 都 赐 给 你 和 你 的 后 裔 。 我 必 坚 定 我 向 你 父 亚 伯 拉 罕 所 起 的 誓 。 \n [kjv] Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; \n [bbe] Keep in this land, and I will be with you and give you my blessing; for to you and to your seed will I give all these lands, giving effect to the oath which I made to your father Abraham; \n 26:4 [hgb] 我 要 加 增 你 的 后 裔 ， 像 天 上 的 星 那 样 多 ， 又 要 将 这 些 地 都 赐 给 你 的 后 裔 。 并 且 地 上 万 国 必 因 你 的 后 裔 得 福 \n [kjv] And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; \n [bbe] I will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number, and will give them all these lands, and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth; \n 26:5 [hgb] 都 因 亚 伯 拉 罕 听 从 我 的 话 ， 遵 守 我 的 吩 咐 和 我 的 命 令 ， 律 例 ， 法 度 。 \n [kjv] Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. \n [bbe] Because Abraham gave ear to my voice and kept my words, my rules, my orders, and my laws. \n 26:6 [hgb] 以 撒 就 住 在 基 拉 耳 。 \n [kjv] And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: \n [bbe] So Isaac went on living in Gerar; \n 26:7 [hgb] 那 地 方 的 人 问 到 他 的 妻 子 ， 他 便 说 ， 那 是 我 的 妹 子 。 原 来 他 怕 说 ， 是 我 的 妻 子 。 他 心 里 想 ， 恐 怕 这 地 方 的 人 为 利 百 加 的 缘 故 杀 我 ， 因 为 她 容 貌 俊 美 。 \n [kjv] And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon. \n [bbe] And when he was questioned by the men of the place about his wife, he said, She is my sister; fearing to say, She is my wife; for, he said, the men of the place may put me to death on account of Rebekah; because she is very beautiful. \n 26:8 [hgb] 他 在 那 里 住 了 许 久 。 有 一 天 ， 非 利 士 人 的 王 亚 比 米 勒 从 窗 户 里 往 外 观 看 ， 见 以 撒 和 他 的 妻 子 利 百 加 戏 玩 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. \n [bbe] And when he had been there for some time, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looking through a window, saw Isaac playing with Rebekah his wife. \n 26:9 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 召 了 以 撒 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 她 实 在 是 你 的 妻 子 ， 你 怎 么 说 她 是 你 的 妹 子 。 以 撒 说 ， 我 心 里 想 ， 恐 怕 我 因 她 而 死 。 \n [kjv] And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. \n [bbe] And he said to Isaac, It is clear that she is your wife: why then did you say, She is my sister? And Isaac said, For fear that I might be put to death because of her. \n 26:10 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 说 ， 你 向 我 们 作 的 是 什 么 事 呢 ？ 民 中 险 些 有 人 和 你 的 妻 同 寝 ， 把 我 们 陷 在 罪 里 。 \n [kjv] And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. \n [bbe] Then Abimelech said, What have you done to us? one of the people might well have had connection with your wife, and the sin would have been ours. \n 26:11 [hgb] 于 是 亚 比 米 勒 晓 谕 众 民 说 ， 凡 沾 着 这 个 人 ， 或 是 他 妻 子 的 ， 定 要 把 他 治 死 。 \n [kjv] And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. \n [bbe] And Abimelech gave orders to his people that anyone touching Isaac or his wife was to be put to death. \n 26:12 [hgb] 以 撒 在 那 地 耕 种 ， 那 一 年 有 百 倍 的 收 成 。 耶 和 华 赐 福 给 他 ， \n [kjv] Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. \n [bbe] Now Isaac, planting seed in that land, got in the same year fruit a hundred times as much, for the blessing of the Lord was on him. \n 26:13 [hgb] 他 就 昌 大 ， 日 增 月 盛 ， 成 了 大 富 户 。 \n [kjv] And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: \n [bbe] And his wealth became very great, increasing more and more; \n 26:14 [hgb] 他 有 羊 群 牛 群 ， 又 有 许 多 仆 人 ， 非 利 士 人 就 嫉 妒 他 。 \n [kjv] For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. \n [bbe] For he had great wealth of flocks and herds and great numbers of servants; so that the Philistines were full of envy. \n 26:15 [hgb] 当 他 父 亲 亚 伯 拉 罕 在 世 的 日 子 ， 他 父 亲 的 仆 人 所 挖 的 井 ， 非 利 士 人 全 都 塞 住 ， 填 满 了 土 。 \n [kjv] For all the wells which his father\u0027s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. \n [bbe] Now all the water-holes, which his father\u0027s servants had made in the days of Abraham, had been stopped up with earth by the Philistines. \n 26:16 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 对 以 撒 说 ， 你 离 开 我 们 去 吧 。 因 为 你 比 我 们 强 盛 得 多 。 \n [kjv] And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. \n [bbe] And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are stronger than we are. \n 26:17 [hgb] 以 撒 就 离 开 那 里 ， 在 基 拉 耳 谷 支 搭 帐 棚 ， 住 在 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. \n [bbe] So Isaac went away from there, and put up his tents in the valley of Gerar, making his living-place there. \n 26:18 [hgb] 当 他 父 亲 亚 伯 拉 罕 在 世 之 日 所 挖 的 水 井 因 非 利 士 人 在 亚 伯 拉 罕 死 后 塞 住 了 ， 以 撒 就 重 新 挖 出 来 ， 仍 照 他 父 亲 所 叫 的 叫 那 些 井 的 名 字 。 \n [kjv] And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. \n [bbe] And he made again the water-holes which had been made in the days of Abraham his father, and which had been stopped up by the Philistines; and he gave them the names which his father had given them. \n 26:19 [hgb] 以 撒 的 仆 人 在 谷 中 挖 井 ， 便 得 了 一 口 活 水 井 。 \n [kjv] And Isaac\u0027s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. \n [bbe] Now Isaac\u0027s servants made holes in the valley, and came to a spring of flowing water. \n 26:20 [hgb] 基 拉 耳 的 牧 人 与 以 撒 的 牧 人 争 竞 ， 说 ， 这 水 是 我 们 的 。 以 撒 就 给 那 井 起 名 叫 埃 色 ， 因 为 他 们 和 他 相 争 （ 埃 色 就 是 相 争 的 意 思 ） 。 \n [kjv] And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac\u0027s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. \n [bbe] But the herdmen of Gerar had a fight with Isaac\u0027s herdmen, for they said, The spring is ours: so he gave the spring the name of Esek, because there was a fight about it. \n 26:21 [hgb] 以 撒 的 仆 人 又 挖 了 一 口 井 ， 他 们 又 为 这 井 争 竞 ， 因 此 以 撒 给 这 井 起 名 叫 西 提 拿 （ 西 提 拿 就 是 为 敌 的 意 思 ） 。 \n [kjv] And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. \n [bbe] Then they made another water-hole, and there was a fight about that, so he gave it the name of Sitnah. \n 26:22 [hgb] 以 撒 离 开 那 里 ， 又 挖 了 一 口 井 ， 他 们 不 为 这 井 争 竞 了 ， 他 就 给 那 井 起 名 叫 利 河 伯 （ 就 是 宽 阔 的 意 思 ） 。 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 现 在 给 我 们 宽 阔 之 地 ， 我 们 必 在 这 地 昌 盛 。 \n [kjv] And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. \n [bbe] Then he went away from there, and made another water-hole, about which there was no fighting: so he gave it the name of Rehoboth, for he said, Now the Lord has made room for us, and we will have fruit in this land. \n 26:23 [hgb] 以 撒 从 那 里 上 别 是 巴 去 。 \n [kjv] And he went up from thence to Beersheba. \n [bbe] And from there he went on to Beer-sheba. \n 26:24 [hgb] 当 夜 耶 和 华 向 他 显 现 ， 说 ， 我 是 你 父 亲 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 神 ， 不 要 惧 怕 ， 因 为 我 与 你 同 在 ， 要 赐 福 给 你 ， 并 要 为 我 仆 人 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 缘 故 ， 使 你 的 后 裔 繁 多 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham\u0027s sake. \n [bbe] That night the Lord came to him in a vision, and said, I am the God of your father Abraham: have no fear for I am with you, blessing you, and your seed will be increased because of my servant Abraham. \n 26:25 [hgb] 以 撒 就 在 那 里 筑 了 一 座 坛 ， 求 告 耶 和 华 的 名 ， 并 且 支 搭 帐 棚 。 他 的 仆 人 便 在 那 里 挖 了 一 口 井 。 \n [kjv] And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac\u0027s servants digged a well. \n [bbe] Then he made an altar there, and gave worship to the name of the Lord, and he put up his tents there, and there his servants made a water-hole. \n 26:26 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 ， 同 他 的 朋 友 亚 户 撒 和 他 的 军 长 非 各 ， 从 基 拉 耳 来 见 以 撒 。 \n [kjv] Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. \n [bbe] And Abimelech had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol, the captain of his army. \n 26:27 [hgb] 以 撒 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 既 然 恨 我 ， 打 发 我 走 了 ， 为 什 么 到 我 这 里 来 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? \n [bbe] And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you? \n 26:28 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 我 们 明 明 地 看 见 耶 和 华 与 你 同 在 ， 便 说 ， 不 如 我 们 两 下 彼 此 起 誓 ， 彼 此 立 约 ， \n [kjv] And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; \n [bbe] And they said, We saw clearly that the Lord was with you: so we said, Let there be an oath between us and you, and let us make an agreement with you; \n 26:29 [hgb] 使 你 不 害 我 们 ， 正 如 我 们 未 曾 害 你 ， 一 味 地 厚 待 你 ， 并 且 打 发 你 平 平 安 安 地 走 。 你 是 蒙 耶 和 华 赐 福 的 了 。 \n [kjv] That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. \n [bbe] That you will do us no damage, even as we put no hand on you, and did you nothing but good, and sent you away in peace: and now the blessing of the Lord is on you. \n 26:30 [hgb] 以 撒 就 为 他 们 设 摆 筵 席 ， 他 们 便 吃 了 喝 了 。 \n [kjv] And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. \n [bbe] Then he made a feast for them, and they all had food and drink. \n 26:31 [hgb] 他 们 清 早 起 来 彼 此 起 誓 。 以 撒 打 发 他 们 走 ， 他 们 就 平 平 安 安 地 离 开 他 走 了 。 \n [kjv] And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. \n [bbe] And early in the morning they took an oath one to the other: then Isaac sent them away and they went on their way in peace. \n 26:32 [hgb] 那 一 天 ， 以 撒 的 仆 人 来 ， 将 挖 井 的 事 告 诉 他 说 ， 我 们 得 了 水 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac\u0027s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. \n [bbe] And that day Isaac\u0027s servants came to him and gave him word of the water-hole which they had made, and said to him, We have come to water. \n 26:33 [hgb] 他 就 给 那 井 起 名 叫 示 巴 。 因 此 那 城 叫 作 别 是 巴 ， 直 到 今 日 。 \n [kjv] And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. \n [bbe] And he gave it the name of Shibah: so the name of that town is Beer-sheba to this day. \n 26:34 [hgb] 以 扫 四 十 岁 的 时 候 娶 了 赫 人 比 利 的 女 儿 犹 滴 ， 与 赫 人 以 伦 的 女 儿 巴 实 抹 为 妻 。 \n [kjv] And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: \n [bbe] And when Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite: \n 26:35 [hgb] 她 们 常 使 以 撒 和 利 百 加 心 里 愁 烦 。 \n [kjv] Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. \n [bbe] And Isaac and Rebekah had grief of mind because of them. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/375.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
