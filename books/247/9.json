[bbe] And God gave his blessing to Noah and his sons, and said, Be fertile, and have increase, and make the earth full. 9:2 [hgb] 凡 地 上 的 走 兽 和 空 中 的 飞 鸟 ， 都 必 惊 恐 ， 惧 怕 你 们 。 连 地 上 一 切 的 昆 虫 并 海 里 一 切 的 鱼 ， 都 交 付 你 们 的 手 。 [kjv] And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. [bbe] And the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air; everything which goes on the land, and all the fishes of the sea, are given into your hands. 9:3 [hgb] 凡 活 着 的 动 物 ， 都 可 以 作 你 们 的 食 物 。 这 一 切 我 都 赐 给 你 们 ， 如 同 菜 蔬 一 样 。 [kjv] Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. [bbe] Every living and moving thing will be food for you; I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things. 9:4 [hgb] 惟 独 肉 带 着 血 ， 那 就 是 它 的 生 命 ， 你 们 不 可 吃 。 [kjv] But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. [bbe] But flesh with the life-blood in it you may not take for food. 9:5 [hgb] 流 你 们 血 ， 害 你 们 命 的 ， 无 论 是 兽 ， 是 人 ， 我 必 讨 他 的 罪 ， 就 是 向 各 人 的 弟 兄 也 是 如 此 。 [kjv] And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man\u0027s brother will I require the life of man. [bbe] And for your blood, which is your life, will I take payment; from every beast I will take it, and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brother-man. 9:6 [hgb] 凡 流 人 血 的 ， 他 的 血 也 必 被 人 所 流 。 因 为 神 造 人 是 照 自 己 的 形 像 造 的 。 [kjv] Whoso sheddeth man\u0027s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. [bbe] Whoever takes a man\u0027s life, by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image. 9:7 [hgb] 你 们 要 生 养 众 多 ， 在 地 上 昌 盛 繁 茂 。 [kjv] And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. [bbe] And now, be fertile and have increase; have offspring on the earth and become great in number. 9:8 [hgb] 神 晓 谕 挪 亚 和 他 的 儿 子 说 ， [kjv] And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, [bbe] And God said to Noah and to his sons, 9:9 [hgb] 我 与 你 们 和 你 们 的 后 裔 立 约 ， [kjv] And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; [bbe] Truly, I will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you, 9:10 [hgb] 并 与 你 们 这 里 的 一 切 活 物 ， 就 是 飞 鸟 ， 牲 畜 ， 走 兽 ， 凡 从 方 舟 里 出 来 的 活 物 立 约 。 [kjv] And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. [bbe] And with every living thing with you, all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you. 9:11 [hgb] 我 与 你 们 立 约 ， 凡 有 血 肉 的 ， 不 再 被 洪 水 灭 绝 ， 也 不 再 有 洪 水 毁 坏 地 了 。 [kjv] And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. [bbe] And I will make my agreement with you; never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters; never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction. 9:12 [hgb] 神 说 ， 我 与 你 们 并 你 们 这 里 的 各 样 活 物 所 立 的 永 约 ， 是 有 记 号 的 。 [kjv] And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: [bbe] And God said, This is the sign of the agreement which I make between me and you and every living thing with you, for all future generations: 9:13 [hgb] 我 把 虹 放 在 云 彩 中 ， 这 就 可 作 我 与 地 立 约 的 记 号 了 。 [kjv] I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. [bbe] I will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth. 9:14 [hgb] 我 使 云 彩 盖 地 的 时 候 ， 必 有 虹 现 在 云 彩 中 ， [kjv] And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: [bbe] And whenever I make a cloud come over the earth, the bow will be seen in the cloud, 9:15 [hgb] 我 便 记 念 我 与 你 们 和 各 样 有 血 肉 的 活 物 所 立 的 约 ， 水 就 再 不 泛 滥 ， 毁 坏 一 切 有 血 肉 的 物 了 。 [kjv] And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. [bbe] And I will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing; and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh. 9:16 [hgb] 虹 必 现 在 云 彩 中 ， 我 看 见 ， 就 要 记 念 我 与 地 上 各 样 有 血 肉 的 活 物 所 立 的 永 约 。 [kjv] And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. [bbe] And the bow will be in the cloud, and looking on it, I will keep in mind the eternal agreement between God and every living thing on the earth. 9:17 [hgb] 神 对 挪 亚 说 ， 这 就 是 我 与 地 上 一 切 有 血 肉 之 物 立 约 的 记 号 了 。 [kjv] And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. [bbe] And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the agreement which I have made between me and all flesh on the earth. 9:18 [hgb] 出 方 舟 挪 亚 的 儿 子 就 是 闪 ， 含 ， 雅 弗 。 含 是 迦 南 的 父 亲 。 [kjv] And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. [bbe] And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan. 9:19 [hgb] 这 是 挪 亚 的 三 个 儿 子 ， 他 们 的 后 裔 分 散 在 全 地 。 [kjv] These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. [bbe] These three were the sons of Noah and from them all the earth was peopled. 9:20 [hgb] 挪 亚 作 起 农 夫 来 ， 栽 了 一 个 葡 萄 园 。 [kjv] And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: [bbe] In those days Noah became a farmer, and he made a vine-garden. 9:21 [hgb] 他 喝 了 园 中 的 酒 便 醉 了 ， 在 帐 棚 里 赤 着 身 子 。 [kjv] And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. [bbe] And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink; and he was uncovered in his tent. 9:22 [hgb] 迦 南 的 父 亲 含 ， 看 见 他 父 亲 赤 身 ， 就 到 外 边 告 诉 他 两 个 弟 兄 。 [kjv] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. [bbe] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father unclothed, and gave news of it to his two brothers outside. 9:23 [hgb] 于 是 闪 和 雅 弗 ， 拿 件 衣 服 搭 在 肩 上 ， 倒 退 着 进 去 ， 给 他 父 亲 盖 上 。 他 们 背 着 脸 就 看 不 见 父 亲 的 赤 身 。 [kjv] And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father\u0027s nakedness. [bbe] And Shem and Japheth took a robe, and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away, and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed. 9:24 [hgb] 挪 亚 醒 了 酒 ， 知 道 小 儿 子 向 他 所 作 的 事 ， [kjv] And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. [bbe] And, awaking from his wine, Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him, and he said, 9:25 [hgb] 就 说 ， 迦 南 当 受 咒 诅 ， 必 给 他 弟 兄 作 奴 仆 的 奴 仆 。 [kjv] And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. [bbe] Cursed be Canaan; let him be a servant of servants to his brothers. 9:26 [hgb] 又 说 ， 耶 和 华 闪 的 神 ， 是 应 当 称 颂 的 ， 愿 迦 南 作 闪 的 奴 仆 。 [kjv] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. [bbe] And he said, Praise to the Lord, the God of Shem; let Canaan be his servant. 9:27 [hgb] 愿 神 使 雅 弗 扩 张 ， 使 他 住 在 闪 的 帐 棚 里 ， 又 愿 迦 南 作 他 的 奴 仆 。 [kjv] God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. [bbe] May God make Japheth great, and let his living-place be in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant. 9:28 [hgb] 洪 水 以 后 ， 挪 亚 又 活 了 三 百 五 十 年 。 [kjv] And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. [bbe] And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters; 9:29 [hgb] 挪 亚 共 活 了 九 百 五 十 岁 就 死 了 。 [kjv] And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died. [bbe] all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty: and he came to his end.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/358.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
