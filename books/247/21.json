for I have born him a son in his old age. \\n\\n [bbe] And she said, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would have a child at her breast? for see, I have given him a son now when he is old. \\n\\n 21:8 [hgb] 孩 子 渐 长 ， 就 断 了 奶 。 以 撒 断 奶 的 日 子 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 设 摆 丰 盛 的 筵 席 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the child was old enough to be taken from the breast, Abraham made a great feast. \\n\\n 21:9 [hgb] 当 时 ， 撒 拉 看 见 埃 及 人 夏 甲 给 亚 伯 拉 罕 所 生 的 儿 子 戏 笑 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. \\n\\n [bbe] And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian playing with Isaac. \\n\\n 21:10 [hgb] 就 对 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 你 把 这 使 女 和 她 儿 子 赶 出 去 ， 因 为 这 使 女 的 儿 子 不 可 与 我 的 儿 子 以 撒 一 同 承 受 产 业 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. \\n\\n [bbe] So she said to Abraham, Send away that woman and her son: for the son of that woman is not to have a part in the heritage with my son Isaac. \\n\\n 21:11 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 因 他 儿 子 的 缘 故 很 忧 愁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the thing was very grievous in Abraham\u0027s sight because of his son. \\n\\n [bbe] And this was a great grief to Abraham because of his son. \\n\\n 21:12 [hgb] 神 对 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 你 不 必 为 这 童 子 和 你 的 使 女 忧 愁 。 凡 撒 拉 对 你 说 的 话 ， 你 都 该 听 从 。 因 为 从 以 撒 生 的 ， 才 要 称 为 你 的 后 裔 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. \\n\\n [bbe] But God said, Let it not be a grief to you because of the boy and Hagar his mother; give ear to whatever Sarah says to you, because it is from Isaac that your seed will take its name. \\n\\n 21:13 [hgb] 至 于 使 女 的 儿 子 ， 我 也 必 使 他 的 后 裔 成 立 一 国 ， 因 为 他 是 你 所 生 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. \\n\\n [bbe] And I will make a nation of the son of your servant-woman, because he is your seed. \\n\\n 21:14 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 清 早 起 来 ， 拿 饼 和 一 皮 袋 水 ， 给 了 夏 甲 ， 搭 在 她 的 肩 上 ， 又 把 孩 子 交 给 她 打 发 她 走 。 夏 甲 就 走 了 ， 在 别 是 巴 的 旷 野 走 迷 了 路 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. \\n\\n [bbe] And early in the morning Abraham got up, and gave Hagar some bread and a water-skin, and put the boy on her back, and sent her away: and she went, wandering in the waste land of Beer-sheba. \\n\\n 21:15 [hgb] 皮 袋 的 水 用 尽 了 ， 夏 甲 就 把 孩 子 撇 在 小 树 底 下 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. \\n\\n [bbe] And when all the water in the skin was used up, she put the child down under a tree. \\n\\n 21:16 [hgb] 自 己 走 开 约 有 一 箭 之 远 ， 相 对 而 坐 ， 说 ， 我 不 忍 见 孩 子 死 ， 就 相 对 而 坐 ， 放 声 大 哭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. \\n\\n [bbe] And she went some distance away, about an arrow flight, and seating herself on the earth, she gave way to bitter weeping, saying, Let me not see the death of my child. \\n\\n 21:17 [hgb] 神 听 见 童 子 的 声 音 。 神 的 使 者 从 天 上 呼 叫 夏 甲 说 ， 夏 甲 ， 你 为 何 这 样 呢 ？ 不 要 害 怕 ， 神 已 经 听 见 童 子 的 声 音 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. \\n\\n [bbe] And the boy\u0027s cry came to the ears of God; and the angel of God said to Hagar from heaven, Hagar, why are you weeping? have no fear, for the child\u0027s cry has come to the ears of God. \\n\\n 21:18 [hgb] 起 来 ， 把 童 子 抱 在 怀 中 （ 怀 原 文 作 手 ） ， 我 必 使 他 的 后 裔 成 为 大 国 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. \\n\\n [bbe] Come, take your child in your arms, for I will make of him a great nation. \\n\\n 21:19 [hgb] 神 使 夏 甲 的 眼 睛 明 亮 ， 她 就 看 见 一 口 水 井 ， 便 去 将 皮 袋 盛 满 了 水 ， 给 童 子 喝 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. \\n\\n [bbe] Then God made her eyes open, and she saw a water-spring, and she got water in the skin and gave the boy a drink. \\n\\n 21:20 [hgb] 神 保 佑 童 子 ， 他 就 渐 长 ， 住 在 旷 野 ， 成 了 弓 箭 手 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. \\n\\n [bbe] And God was with the boy, and he became tall and strong, and he became a bowman, living in the waste land. \\n\\n 21:21 [hgb] 他 住 在 巴 兰 的 旷 野 。 他 母 亲 从 埃 及 地 给 他 娶 了 一 个 妻 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. \\n\\n [bbe] And while he was in the waste land of Paran, his mother got him a wife from the land of Egypt. \\n\\n 21:22 [hgb] 当 那 时 候 ， 亚 比 米 勒 同 他 军 长 非 各 对 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 凡 你 所 行 的 事 都 有 神 的 保 佑 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest: \\n\\n [bbe] Now at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, said to Abraham, I see that God is with you in all you do. \\n\\n 21:23 [hgb] 我 愿 你 如 今 在 这 里 指 着 神 对 我 起 誓 ， 不 要 欺 负 我 与 我 的 儿 子 ， 并 我 的 子 孙 。 我 怎 样 厚 待 了 你 ， 你 也 要 照 样 厚 待 我 与 你 所 寄 居 这 地 的 民 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son\u0027s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. \\n\\n [bbe] Now, then, give me your oath, in the name of God, that you will not be false to me or to my sons after me, but that as I have been good to you, so you will be to me and to this land where you have been living. \\n\\n 21:24 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 我 情 愿 起 誓 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abraham said, I will swear. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abraham said, I will give you my oath. \\n\\n 21:25 [hgb] 从 前 ， 亚 比 米 勒 的 仆 人 霸 占 了 一 口 水 井 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 为 这 事 指 责 亚 比 米 勒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech\u0027s servants had violently taken away. \\n\\n [bbe] But Abraham made a protest to Abimelech because of a water-hole which Abimelech\u0027s servants had taken by force. \\n\\n 21:26 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 说 ， 谁 作 这 事 ， 我 不 知 道 ， 你 也 没 有 告 诉 我 ， 今 日 我 才 听 见 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day. \\n\\n [bbe] But Abimelech said, I have no idea who has done this thing; you never gave me word of it, and I had no knowledge of it till this day. \\n\\n 21:27 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 把 羊 和 牛 给 了 亚 比 米 勒 ， 二 人 就 彼 此 立 约 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made an agreement together. \\n\\n 21:28 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 把 七 只 母 羊 羔 另 放 在 一 处 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abraham put seven young lambs of the flock on one side by themselves. \\n\\n 21:29 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 问 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 你 把 这 七 只 母 羊 羔 另 放 在 一 处 ， 是 什 么 意 思 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? \\n\\n [bbe] Then Abimelech said, What are these seven lambs which you have put on one side? \\n\\n 21:30 [hgb] 他 说 ， 你 要 从 我 手 里 受 这 七 只 母 羊 羔 ， 作 我 挖 这 口 井 的 证 据 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, Take these seven lambs from me as a witness that I have made this water-hole. \\n\\n 21:31 [hgb] 所 以 他 给 那 地 方 起 名 叫 别 是 巴 ， 因 为 他 们 二 人 在 那 里 起 了 誓 。 （ 别 是 巴 就 是 盟 誓 的 井 ） \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. \\n\\n [bbe] So he gave that place the name Beer-sheba, because there the two of them had given their oaths. \\n\\n 21:32 [hgb] 他 们 在 别 是 巴 立 了 约 ， 亚 比 米 勒 就 同 他 军 长 非 各 起 身 回 非 利 士 地 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. \\n\\n [bbe] So they made an agreement at Beer-sheba, and Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, went back to the land of the Philistines. \\n\\n 21:33 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 在 别 是 巴 栽 上 一 棵 垂 丝 柳 树 ， 又 在 那 里 求 告 耶 和 华 永 生 神 的 名 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abraham, after planting a holy tree in Beer-sheba, gave worship to the name of the Lord, the Eternal God. \\n\\n 21:34 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 在 非 利 士 人 的 地 寄 居 了 多 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines\u0027 land many days. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abraham went on living in the land of the Philistines as in a strange country. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/370.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
