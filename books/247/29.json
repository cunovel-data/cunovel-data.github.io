[bbe] Then Jacob went on his journey till he came to the land of the children of the East. 29:2 [hgb] 看 见 田 间 有 一 口 井 ， 有 三 群 羊 卧 在 井 旁 。 因 为 人 饮 羊 群 都 是 用 那 井 里 的 水 。 井 口 上 的 石 头 是 大 的 。 [kjv] And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well\u0027s mouth. [bbe] And there he saw a water-hole in a field, and by the side of it three flocks of sheep, for there they got water for the sheep: and on the mouth of the water-hole there was a great stone. 29:3 [hgb] 常 有 羊 群 在 那 里 聚 集 ， 牧 人 把 石 头 转 离 井 口 饮 羊 ， 随 后 又 把 石 头 放 在 井 口 的 原 处 。 [kjv] And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well\u0027s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well\u0027s mouth in his place. [bbe] And all the flocks would come together there, and when the stone had been rolled away, they would give the sheep water, and put the stone back again in its place on the mouth of the water-hole. 29:4 [hgb] 雅 各 对 牧 人 说 ， 弟 兄 们 ， 你 们 是 哪 里 来 的 ， 他 们 说 ， 我 们 是 哈 兰 来 的 。 [kjv] And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. [bbe] Then Jacob said to the herdmen, My brothers, where do you come from? And they said, From Haran. 29:5 [hgb] 他 问 他 们 说 ， 拿 鹤 的 孙 子 拉 班 ， 你 们 认 识 吗 ？ 他 们 说 ， 我 们 认 识 。 [kjv] And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. [bbe] And he said to them, Have you any knowledge of Laban, the son of Nahor? And they said, We have. 29:6 [hgb] 雅 各 说 ， 他 平 安 吗 ？ 他 们 说 ， 平 安 。 看 哪 ， 他 女 儿 拉 结 领 着 羊 来 了 。 [kjv] And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. [bbe] And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well, and here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep. 29:7 [hgb] 雅 各 说 ， 日 头 还 高 ， 不 是 羊 群 聚 集 的 时 候 ， 你 们 不 如 饮 羊 ， 再 去 放 一 放 。 [kjv] And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them. [bbe] Then Jacob said, The sun is still high and it is not time to get the cattle together: get water for the sheep and go and give them their food. 29:8 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 我 们 不 能 ， 必 等 羊 群 聚 齐 ， 人 把 石 头 转 离 井 口 才 可 饮 羊 。 [kjv] And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well\u0027s mouth; then we water the sheep. [bbe] And they said, We are not able to do so till all the flocks have come together and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the water-hole; then we will get water for the sheep. 29:9 [hgb] 雅 各 正 和 他 们 说 话 的 时 候 ， 拉 结 领 着 她 父 亲 的 羊 来 了 ， 因 为 那 些 羊 是 她 牧 放 的 。 [kjv] And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father\u0027s sheep: for she kept them. [bbe] While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father\u0027s sheep, for she took care of them. 29:10 [hgb] 雅 各 看 见 母 舅 拉 班 的 女 儿 拉 结 和 母 舅 拉 班 的 羊 群 ， 就 上 前 把 石 头 转 离 井 口 ， 饮 他 母 舅 拉 班 的 羊 群 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother\u0027s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother\u0027s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well\u0027s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother\u0027s brother. [bbe] Then when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother\u0027s brother, coming with Laban\u0027s sheep, he came near, and rolling the stone away from the mouth of the hole, he got water for Laban\u0027s flock. 29:11 [hgb] 雅 各 与 拉 结 亲 嘴 ， 就 放 声 而 哭 。 [kjv] And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. [bbe] And weeping for joy, Jacob gave Rachel a kiss. 29:12 [hgb] 雅 各 告 诉 拉 结 ， 自 己 是 她 父 亲 的 外 甥 ， 是 利 百 加 的 儿 子 ， 拉 结 就 跑 去 告 诉 她 父 亲 。 [kjv] And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father\u0027s brother, and that he was Rebekah\u0027s son: and she ran and told her father. [bbe] And Rachel, hearing from Jacob that he was her father\u0027s relation and that he was the son of Rebekah, went running to give her father news of it. 29:13 [hgb] 拉 班 听 见 外 甥 雅 各 的 信 息 ， 就 跑 去 迎 接 ， 抱 着 他 ， 与 他 亲 嘴 ， 领 他 到 自 己 的 家 。 雅 各 将 一 切 的 情 由 告 诉 拉 班 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister\u0027s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. [bbe] And Laban, hearing news of Jacob, his sister\u0027s son, came running, and took Jacob in his arms, and kissing him, made him come into his house. And Jacob gave him news of everything. 29:14 [hgb] 拉 班 对 他 说 ， 你 实 在 是 我 的 骨 肉 。 雅 各 就 和 他 同 住 了 一 个 月 。 [kjv] And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. [bbe] And Laban said to him, Truly, you are my bone and my flesh. And he kept Jacob with him for the space of a month. 29:15 [hgb] 拉 班 对 雅 各 说 ， 你 虽 是 我 的 骨 肉 （ 原 文 作 弟 兄 ） ， 岂 可 白 白 地 服 事 我 ？ 请 告 诉 我 ， 你 要 什 么 为 工 价 ？ [kjv] And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be? [bbe] Then Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother are you to be my servant for nothing? say now, what is your payment to be? 29:16 [hgb] 拉 班 有 两 个 女 儿 ， 大 的 名 叫 利 亚 ， 小 的 名 叫 拉 结 。 [kjv] And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. [bbe] Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 29:17 [hgb] 利 亚 的 眼 睛 没 有 神 气 ， 拉 结 却 生 得 美 貌 俊 秀 。 [kjv] Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. [bbe] And Leah\u0027s eyes were clouded, but Rachel was fair in face and form. 29:18 [hgb] 雅 各 爱 拉 结 ， 就 说 ， 我 愿 为 你 小 女 儿 拉 结 服 事 你 七 年 。 [kjv] And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. [bbe] And Jacob was in love with Rachel; and he said, I will be your servant seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter. 29:19 [hgb] 拉 班 说 ， 我 把 她 给 你 ， 胜 似 给 别 人 ， 你 与 我 同 住 吧 。 [kjv] And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me. [bbe] And Laban said, It is better for you to have her than another man: go on living here with me. 29:20 [hgb] 雅 各 就 为 拉 结 服 事 了 七 年 。 他 因 为 深 爱 拉 结 ， 就 看 这 七 年 如 同 几 天 。 [kjv] And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her. [bbe] And Jacob did seven years\u0027 work for Rachel; and because of his love for her it seemed to him only a very little time. 29:21 [hgb] 雅 各 对 拉 班 说 ， 日 期 已 经 满 了 ， 求 你 把 我 的 妻 子 给 我 ， 我 好 与 她 同 房 。 [kjv] And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. [bbe] Then Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife so that I may have her, for the days are ended. 29:22 [hgb] 拉 班 就 摆 设 筵 席 ， 请 齐 了 那 地 方 的 众 人 。 [kjv] And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. [bbe] And Laban got together all the men of the place and gave a feast. 29:23 [hgb] 到 晚 上 ， 拉 班 将 女 儿 利 亚 送 来 给 雅 各 ， 雅 各 就 与 她 同 房 。 [kjv] And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. [bbe] And in the evening he took Leah, his daughter, and gave her to him, and he went in to her. 29:24 [hgb] 拉 班 又 将 婢 女 悉 帕 给 女 儿 利 亚 作 使 女 。 [kjv] And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid. [bbe] And Laban gave Zilpah, his servant-girl, to Leah, to be her waiting-woman. 29:25 [hgb] 到 了 早 晨 ， 雅 各 一 看 是 利 亚 ， 就 对 拉 班 说 ， 你 向 我 作 的 是 什 么 事 呢 ？ 我 服 事 你 ， 不 是 为 拉 结 吗 ？ 你 为 什 么 欺 哄 我 呢 ？ [kjv] And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? [bbe] And in the morning Jacob saw that it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What have you done to me? was I not working for you so that I might have Rachel? why have you been false to me? 29:26 [hgb] 拉 班 说 ， 大 女 儿 还 没 有 给 人 ， 先 把 小 女 儿 给 人 ， 在 我 们 这 地 方 没 有 这 规 矩 。 [kjv] And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. [bbe] And Laban said, In our country we do not let the younger daughter be married before the older. 29:27 [hgb] 你 为 这 个 满 了 七 日 ， 我 就 把 那 个 也 给 你 ， 你 再 为 她 服 事 我 七 年 。 [kjv] Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. [bbe] Let the week of the bride-feast come to its end and then we will give you the other in addition, if you will be my servant for another seven years. 29:28 [hgb] 雅 各 就 如 此 行 。 满 了 利 亚 的 七 日 ， 拉 班 便 将 女 儿 拉 结 给 雅 各 为 妻 。 [kjv] And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. [bbe] And Jacob did so; and when the week was ended, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel for his wife. 29:29 [hgb] 拉 班 又 将 婢 女 辟 拉 给 女 儿 拉 结 作 使 女 。 [kjv] And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. [bbe] And Laban gave Rachel his servant-girl Bilhah to be her waiting-woman. 29:30 [hgb] 雅 各 也 与 拉 结 同 房 ， 并 且 爱 拉 结 胜 似 爱 利 亚 ， 于 是 又 服 事 了 拉 班 七 年 。 [kjv] And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. [bbe] Then Jacob took Rachel as his wife, and his love for her was greater than his love for Leah; and he went on working for Laban for another seven years. 29:31 [hgb] 耶 和 华 见 利 亚 失 宠 （ 原 文 作 被 恨 下 同 ） ， 就 使 她 生 育 ， 拉 结 却 不 生 育 。 [kjv] And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren. [bbe] Now the Lord, seeing that Leah was not loved, gave her a child; while Rachel had no children. 29:32 [hgb] 利 亚 怀 孕 生 子 ， 就 给 他 起 名 叫 流 便 （ 就 是 有 儿 子 的 意 思 ） ， 因 而 说 ， 耶 和 华 看 见 我 的 苦 情 ， 如 今 我 的 丈 夫 必 爱 我 。 [kjv] And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me. [bbe] And Leah was with child, and gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name Reuben: for she said, The Lord has seen my sorrow; now my husband will have love for me. 29:33 [hgb] 她 又 怀 孕 生 子 ， 就 说 ， 耶 和 华 因 为 听 见 我 失 宠 ， 所 以 又 赐 给 我 这 个 儿 子 。 于 是 给 他 起 名 叫 西 缅 （ 就 是 听 见 的 意 思 ） 。 [kjv] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon. [bbe] Then she became with child again, and gave birth to a son; and said, Because it has come to the Lord\u0027s ears that I am not loved, he has given me this son in addition: and she gave him the name Simeon. 29:34 [hgb] 她 又 怀 孕 生 子 ， 起 名 叫 利 未 （ 就 是 联 合 的 意 思 ） ， 说 ， 我 给 丈 夫 生 了 三 个 儿 子 ， 他 必 与 我 联 合 。 [kjv] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. [bbe] And she was with child again, and gave birth to a son; and said, Now at last my husband will be united to me, because I have given him three sons: so he was named Levi. 29:35 [hgb] 她 又 怀 孕 生 子 ， 说 ， 这 回 我 要 赞 美 耶 和 华 ， 因 此 给 他 起 名 叫 犹 大 （ 就 是 赞 美 的 意 思 ） 。 这 才 停 了 生 育 。 [kjv] And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing. [bbe] And she was with child again, and gave birth to a son: and she said, This time I will give praise to the Lord: so he was named Judah; after this she had no more children for a time.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/378.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
