{"id":7604,"no":48,"title":"Chapter 48","content":"48:1 [hgb] 这 事 以 后 ， 有 人 告 诉 约 瑟 说 ， 你 的 父 亲 病 了 。 他 就 带 着 两 个 儿 子 玛 拿 西 和 以 法 莲 同 去 。 [kjv] And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. [bbe] Now after these things, word came to Joseph that his father was ill: and he took with him his sons Manasseh and Ephraim. 48:2 [hgb] 有 人 告 诉 雅 各 说 ， 请 看 ， 你 儿 子 约 瑟 到 你 这 里 来 了 。 以 色 列 就 勉 强 在 床 上 坐 起 来 。 [kjv] And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. [bbe] And when they said to Jacob, Your son Joseph is coming to see you: then Israel, getting all his strength together, had himself lifted up in his bed. 48:3 [hgb] 雅 各 对 约 瑟 说 ， 全 能 的 神 曾 在 迦 南 地 的 路 斯 向 我 显 现 ， 赐 福 与 我 ， [kjv] And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, [bbe] And Jacob said to Joseph, God, the Ruler of all, came to me in a vision at Luz in the land of Canaan, and gave me his blessing, 48:4 [hgb] 对 我 说 ， 我 必 使 你 生 养 众 多 ， 成 为 多 民 ， 又 要 把 这 地 赐 给 你 的 后 裔 ， 永 远 为 业 。 [kjv] And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. [bbe] And said to me, Truly, I will make you fertile and give you increase and will make of you a great family of nations: and I will give this land to your seed after you to be their heritage for ever. 48:5 [hgb] 我 未 到 埃 及 见 你 之 先 ， 你 在 埃 及 地 所 生 的 以 法 莲 和 玛 拿 西 这 两 个 儿 子 是 我 的 ， 正 如 流 便 和 西 缅 是 我 的 一 样 。 [kjv] And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. [bbe] And now your two sons who came to birth in Egypt before I came to you here, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, in the same way as Reuben and Simeon are. 48:6 [hgb] 你 在 他 们 以 后 所 生 的 就 是 你 的 ， 他 们 可 以 归 于 他 们 弟 兄 的 名 下 得 产 业 。 [kjv] And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. [bbe] And any other offspring which you have after them, will be yours, and will be named after their brothers in their heritage. 48:7 [hgb] 至 于 我 ， 我 从 巴 旦 来 的 时 候 ， 拉 结 死 在 我 眼 前 ， 在 迦 南 地 的 路 上 ， 离 以 法 他 还 有 一 段 路 程 ， 我 就 把 她 葬 在 以 法 他 的 路 上 。 以 法 他 就 是 伯 利 恒 。 [kjv] And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem. [bbe] And as for me, when I came from Paddan, death overtook Rachel on the way, when we were still some distance from Ephrath; and I put her to rest there on the road to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem. 48:8 [hgb] 以 色 列 看 见 约 瑟 的 两 个 儿 子 ， 就 说 ， 这 是 谁 ？ [kjv] And Israel beheld Joseph\u0027s sons, and said, Who are these? [bbe] Then Israel, looking at Joseph\u0027s sons, said, Who are these? 48:9 [hgb] 约 瑟 对 他 父 亲 说 ， 这 是 神 在 这 里 赐 给 我 的 儿 子 。 以 色 列 说 ， 请 你 领 他 们 到 我 跟 前 ， 我 要 给 他 们 祝 福 。 [kjv] And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. [bbe] And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this land. And he said, Let them come near me, and I will give them a blessing. 48:10 [hgb] 以 色 列 年 纪 老 迈 ， 眼 睛 昏 花 ， 不 能 看 见 。 约 瑟 领 他 们 到 他 跟 前 ， 他 就 和 他 们 亲 嘴 ， 抱 着 他 们 。 [kjv] Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. [bbe] Now because Israel was old, his eyes were no longer clear, and he was not able to see. So he made them come near to him, and he gave them a kiss, folding them in his arms. 48:11 [hgb] 以 色 列 对 约 瑟 说 ， 我 想 不 到 得 见 你 的 面 ， 不 料 ， 神 又 使 我 得 见 你 的 儿 子 。 [kjv] And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. [bbe] And Israel said to Joseph, I had no hope of seeing your face again, but God in his mercy has let me see you and your children. 48:12 [hgb] 约 瑟 把 两 个 儿 子 从 以 色 列 两 膝 中 领 出 来 ， 自 己 就 脸 伏 于 地 下 拜 。 [kjv] And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. [bbe] Then Joseph took them from between his knees, and went down on his face to the earth. 48:13 [hgb] 随 后 ， 约 瑟 又 拉 着 他 们 两 个 ， 以 法 莲 在 他 的 右 手 里 ， 对 着 以 色 列 的 左 手 ， 玛 拿 西 在 他 的 左 手 里 ， 对 着 以 色 列 的 右 手 ， 领 他 们 到 以 色 列 的 跟 前 。 [kjv] And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel\u0027s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel\u0027s right hand, and brought them near unto him. [bbe] Then taking Ephraim with his right hand, Joseph put him at Israel\u0027s left side, and with his left hand he put Manasseh at Israel\u0027s right side, placing them near him. 48:14 [hgb] 以 色 列 伸 出 右 手 来 ， 按 在 以 法 莲 的 头 上 ， 以 法 莲 乃 是 次 子 。 又 剪 搭 过 左 手 来 ， 按 在 玛 拿 西 的 头 上 ， 玛 拿 西 原 是 长 子 。 [kjv] And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim\u0027s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh\u0027s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. [bbe] And Israel, stretching out his right hand, put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands on purpose, for Manasseh was the older. 48:15 [hgb] 他 就 给 约 瑟 祝 福 说 ， 愿 我 祖 亚 伯 拉 罕 和 我 父 以 撒 所 事 奉 的 神 ， 就 是 一 生 牧 养 我 直 到 今 日 的 神 ， [kjv] And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, [bbe] And he gave Joseph a blessing, saying, May the God to whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, gave worship, the God who has taken care of me all my life till this day, 48:16 [hgb] 救 赎 我 脱 离 一 切 患 难 的 那 使 者 ， 赐 福 与 这 两 个 童 子 。 愿 他 们 归 在 我 的 名 下 和 我 祖 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 我 父 以 撒 的 名 下 。 又 愿 他 们 在 世 界 中 生 养 众 多 。 [kjv] The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. [bbe] The angel who has been my saviour from all evil, send his blessing on these children: and let my name and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, be given to them; and let them become a great nation in the earth. 48:17 [hgb] 约 瑟 见 他 父 亲 把 右 手 按 在 以 法 莲 的 头 上 ， 就 不 喜 悦 ， 便 提 起 他 父 亲 的 手 ， 要 从 以 法 莲 的 头 上 挪 到 玛 拿 西 的 头 上 。 [kjv] And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father\u0027s hand, to remove it from Ephraim\u0027s head unto Manasseh\u0027s head. [bbe] Now when Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it did not seem right to him; and lifting his father\u0027s hand he would have put it on the head of Manasseh. 48:18 [hgb] 约 瑟 对 他 父 亲 说 ， 我 父 ， 不 是 这 样 。 这 本 是 长 子 ， 求 你 把 右 手 按 在 他 的 头 上 。 [kjv] And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. [bbe] And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the older; put your right hand on his head. 48:19 [hgb] 他 父 亲 不 从 ， 说 ， 我 知 道 ， 我 儿 ， 我 知 道 。 他 也 必 成 为 一 族 ， 也 必 昌 大 。 只 是 他 的 兄 弟 将 来 比 他 还 大 。 他 兄 弟 的 后 裔 要 成 为 多 族 。 [kjv] And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. [bbe] But his father would not, saying, I am doing it on purpose, my son; he will certainly become a nation and a great one; but his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a great family of nations. 48:20 [hgb] 当 日 就 给 他 们 祝 福 说 ， 以 色 列 人 要 指 着 你 们 祝 福 说 ， 愿 神 使 你 如 以 法 莲 ， 玛 拿 西 一 样 。 于 是 立 以 法 莲 在 玛 拿 西 以 上 。 [kjv] And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. [bbe] So he gave them his blessing that day, saying, You will be the sign of blessing in Israel, for they will say, May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh; and he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 48:21 [hgb] 以 色 列 又 对 约 瑟 说 ， 我 要 死 了 ， 但 神 必 与 你 们 同 在 ， 领 你 们 回 到 你 们 列 祖 之 地 。 [kjv] And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. [bbe] Then Israel said to Joseph, Now my death is near; but God will be with you, guiding you back to the land of your fathers. 48:22 [hgb] 并 且 我 从 前 用 弓 用 刀 从 亚 摩 利 人 手 下 夺 的 那 块 地 ， 我 都 赐 给 你 ， 使 你 比 众 弟 兄 多 得 一 分 。 [kjv] Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. [bbe] And I have given you more than your brothers, even Shechem as your heritage, which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/397.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
