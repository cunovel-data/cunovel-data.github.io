[bbe] Now Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had by Jacob, went out to see the women of that country. 34:2 [hgb] 那 地 的 主 希 未 人 ， 哈 抹 的 儿 子 示 剑 看 见 她 ， 就 拉 住 她 ， 与 她 行 淫 ， 玷 辱 她 。 [kjv] And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. [bbe] And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite who was the chief of that land, saw her, he took her by force and had connection with her. 34:3 [hgb] 示 剑 的 心 系 恋 雅 各 的 女 儿 底 拿 ， 喜 爱 这 女 子 ， 甜 言 蜜 语 地 安 慰 她 。 [kjv] And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. [bbe] Then his heart went out in love to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he said comforting words to her. 34:4 [hgb] 示 剑 对 他 父 亲 哈 抹 说 ， 求 你 为 我 聘 这 女 子 为 妻 。 [kjv] And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. [bbe] And Shechem said to Hamor, his father, Get me this girl for my wife. 34:5 [hgb] 雅 各 听 见 示 剑 玷 污 了 他 的 女 儿 底 拿 。 那 时 他 的 儿 子 们 正 和 群 畜 在 田 野 ， 雅 各 就 闭 口 不 言 ， 等 他 们 回 来 。 [kjv] And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. [bbe] Now Jacob had word of what Shechem had done to his daughter; but his sons were in the fields with the cattle, and Jacob said nothing till they came. 34:6 [hgb] 示 剑 的 父 亲 哈 抹 出 来 见 雅 各 ， 要 和 他 商 议 。 [kjv] And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. [bbe] Then Hamor, the father of Shechem, came out to have a talk with Jacob. 34:7 [hgb] 雅 各 的 儿 子 们 听 见 这 事 ， 就 从 田 野 回 来 ， 人 人 忿 恨 ， 十 分 恼 怒 。 因 示 剑 在 以 色 列 家 作 了 丑 事 ， 与 雅 各 的 女 儿 行 淫 ， 这 本 是 不 该 作 的 事 。 [kjv] And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob\u0027s daughter; which thing ought not to be done. [bbe] Now the sons of Jacob came in from the fields when they had news of it, and they were wounded and very angry because of the shame he had done in Israel by having connection with Jacob\u0027s daughter; and they said, Such a thing is not to be done. 34:8 [hgb] 哈 抹 和 他 们 商 议 说 ， 我 儿 子 示 剑 的 心 恋 慕 这 女 子 ， 求 你 们 将 她 给 我 的 儿 子 为 妻 。 [kjv] And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. [bbe] But Hamor said to them, Shechem, my son, is full of desire for your daughter: will you then give her to him for a wife? 34:9 [hgb] 你 们 与 我 们 彼 此 结 亲 。 你 们 可 以 把 女 儿 给 我 们 ， 也 可 以 娶 我 们 的 女 儿 。 [kjv] And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. [bbe] And let our two peoples be joined together; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. 34:10 [hgb] 你 们 与 我 们 同 住 吧 。 这 地 都 在 你 们 面 前 ， 只 管 在 此 居 住 ， 作 买 卖 ， 置 产 业 。 [kjv] And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. [bbe] Go on living with us, and the country will be open to you; do trade and get property there. 34:11 [hgb] 示 剑 对 女 儿 的 父 亲 和 弟 兄 们 说 ， 但 愿 我 在 你 们 眼 前 蒙 恩 ， 你 们 向 我 要 什 么 ， 我 必 给 你 们 。 [kjv] And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. [bbe] And Shechem said to her father and her brothers, If you will give ear to my request, whatever you say I will give to you. 34:12 [hgb] 任 凭 向 我 要 多 重 的 聘 金 和 礼 物 ， 我 必 照 你 们 所 说 的 给 你 们 。 只 要 把 女 子 给 我 为 妻 。 [kjv] Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. [bbe] However great you make the bride-price and payment, I will give it; only let me have the girl for my wife. 34:13 [hgb] 雅 各 的 儿 子 们 因 为 示 剑 玷 污 了 他 们 的 妹 子 底 拿 ， 就 用 诡 诈 的 话 回 答 示 剑 和 他 父 亲 哈 抹 ， [kjv] And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: [bbe] But the sons of Jacob gave a false answer to Shechem and Hamor his father, because of what had been done to Dinah their sister. 34:14 [hgb] 对 他 们 说 ， 我 们 不 能 把 我 们 的 妹 子 给 没 有 受 割 礼 的 人 为 妻 ， 因 为 那 是 我 们 的 羞 辱 。 [kjv] And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: [bbe] And they said, It is not possible for us to give our sister to one who is without circumcision, for that would be a cause of shame to us: 34:15 [hgb] 惟 有 一 件 才 可 以 应 允 ， 若 你 们 所 有 的 男 丁 都 受 割 礼 ， 和 我 们 一 样 ， [kjv] But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; [bbe] But on this condition only will we come to an agreement with you: if every male among you becomes like us and undergoes circumcision; 34:16 [hgb] 我 们 就 把 女 儿 给 你 们 ， 也 娶 你 们 的 女 儿 。 我 们 便 与 你 们 同 住 ， 两 下 成 为 一 样 的 人 民 。 [kjv] Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. [bbe] Then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and go on living with you as one people. 34:17 [hgb] 倘 若 你 们 不 听 从 我 们 受 割 礼 ， 我 们 就 带 着 妹 子 走 了 。 [kjv] But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. [bbe] But if you will not undergo circumcision as we say, then we will take our daughter and go. 34:18 [hgb] 哈 抹 和 他 的 儿 子 示 剑 喜 欢 这 话 。 [kjv] And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor\u0027s son. [bbe] And their words were pleasing to Hamor and his son Shechem. 34:19 [hgb] 那 少 年 人 作 这 事 并 不 迟 延 ， 因 为 他 喜 爱 雅 各 的 女 儿 。 他 在 他 父 亲 家 中 也 是 人 最 尊 重 的 。 [kjv] And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob\u0027s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father. [bbe] And without loss of time the young man did as they said, because he had delight in Jacob\u0027s daughter, and he was the noblest of his father\u0027s house. 34:20 [hgb] 哈 抹 和 他 儿 子 示 剑 到 本 城 的 门 口 ， 对 本 城 的 人 说 ， [kjv] And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, [bbe] Then Hamor and Shechem, his son, went to the meeting-place of their town, and said to the men of the town, 34:21 [hgb] 这 些 人 与 我 们 和 睦 ， 不 如 许 他 们 在 这 地 居 住 ， 作 买 卖 。 这 地 也 宽 阔 ， 足 可 容 下 他 们 。 我 们 可 以 娶 他 们 的 女 儿 为 妻 ， 也 可 以 把 我 们 的 女 儿 嫁 给 他 们 。 [kjv] These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. [bbe] It is the desire of these men to be at peace with us; let them then go on living in this country and doing trade here, for the country is wide open before them; let us take their daughters as wives and let us give them our daughters. 34:22 [hgb] 惟 有 一 件 事 我 们 必 须 作 ， 他 们 才 肯 应 允 和 我 们 同 住 ， 成 为 一 样 的 人 民 ， 就 是 我 们 中 间 所 有 的 男 丁 都 要 受 割 礼 ， 和 他 们 一 样 。 [kjv] Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. [bbe] But these men will make an agreement with us to go on living with us and to become one people, only on the condition that every male among us undergoes circumcision as they have done. 34:23 [hgb] 他 们 的 群 畜 ， 货 财 ， 和 一 切 的 牲 口 岂 不 都 归 我 们 吗 ？ 只 要 依 从 他 们 ， 他 们 就 与 我 们 同 住 。 [kjv] Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. [bbe] Then will not their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours? so let us come to an agreement with them so that they may go on living with us. 34:24 [hgb] 凡 从 城 门 出 入 的 人 就 都 听 从 哈 抹 和 他 儿 子 示 剑 的 话 。 于 是 凡 从 城 门 出 入 的 男 丁 都 受 了 割 礼 。 [kjv] And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. [bbe] Then all the men of the town gave ear to the words of Hamor and Shechem his son; and every male in the town underwent circumcision. 34:25 [hgb] 到 第 三 天 ， 众 人 正 在 疼 痛 的 时 候 ， 雅 各 的 两 个 儿 子 ， 就 是 底 拿 的 哥 哥 西 缅 和 利 未 ， 各 拿 刀 剑 ， 趁 着 众 人 想 不 到 的 时 候 来 到 城 中 ， 把 一 切 男 丁 都 杀 了 ， [kjv] And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah\u0027s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. [bbe] But on the third day after, before the wounds were well, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah\u0027s brothers, took their swords and came into the town by surprise and put all the males to death. 34:26 [hgb] 又 用 刀 杀 了 哈 抹 和 他 儿 子 示 剑 ， 把 底 拿 从 示 剑 家 里 带 出 来 就 走 了 。 [kjv] And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem\u0027s house, and went out. [bbe] And Hamor and his son they put to death with the sword, and they took Dinah from Shechem\u0027s house and went away. 34:27 [hgb] 雅 各 的 儿 子 们 因 为 他 们 的 妹 子 受 了 玷 污 ， 就 来 到 被 杀 的 人 那 里 ， 掳 掠 那 城 ， [kjv] The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. [bbe] And the sons of Jacob came on them when they were wounded and made waste the town because of what had been done to their sister; 34:28 [hgb] 夺 了 他 们 的 羊 群 ， 牛 群 ， 和 驴 ， 并 城 里 田 间 所 有 的 。 [kjv] They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, [bbe] They took their flocks and their herds and their asses and everything in their town and in their fields, 34:29 [hgb] 又 把 他 们 一 切 货 财 ， 孩 子 ， 妇 女 ， 并 各 房 中 所 有 的 ， 都 掳 掠 去 了 。 [kjv] And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house. [bbe] And all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives; everything in their houses they took and made them waste. 34:30 [hgb] 雅 各 对 西 缅 和 利 未 说 ， 你 们 连 累 我 ， 使 我 在 这 地 的 居 民 中 ， 就 是 在 迦 南 人 和 比 利 洗 人 中 ， 有 了 臭 名 。 我 的 人 丁 既 然 稀 少 ， 他 们 必 聚 集 来 击 杀 我 ， 我 和 全 家 的 人 都 必 灭 绝 。 [kjv] And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. [bbe] And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have made trouble for me and given me a bad name among the people of this country, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and because we are small in number they will come together against me and make war on me; and it will be the end of me and all my people. 34:31 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 他 岂 可 待 我 们 的 妹 子 如 同 妓 女 吗 ？ [kjv] And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot? [bbe] But they said, Were we to let him make use of our sister as a loose woman?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/383.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
