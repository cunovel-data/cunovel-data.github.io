{"id":7578,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"22:1 [hgb] 这 些 事 以 后 ， 神 要 试 验 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 就 呼 叫 他 说 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 他 说 ， 我 在 这 里 。 [kjv] And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. [bbe] Now after these things, God put Abraham to the test, and said to him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I. 22:2 [hgb] 神 说 ， 你 带 着 你 的 儿 子 ， 就 是 你 独 生 的 儿 子 ， 你 所 爱 的 以 撒 ， 往 摩 利 亚 地 去 ， 在 我 所 要 指 示 你 的 山 上 ， 把 他 献 为 燔 祭 。 [kjv] And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. [bbe] And he said to him, Take your son, your dearly loved only son Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah and give him as a burned offering on one of the mountains of which I will give you knowledge. 22:3 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 清 早 起 来 ， 备 上 驴 ， 带 着 两 个 仆 人 和 他 儿 子 以 撒 ， 也 劈 好 了 燔 祭 的 柴 ， 就 起 身 往 神 所 指 示 他 的 地 方 去 了 。 [kjv] And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. [bbe] And Abraham got up early in the morning, and made ready his ass, and took with him two of his young men and Isaac, his son, and after the wood for the burned offering had been cut, he went on his way to the place of which God had given him word. 22:4 [hgb] 到 了 第 三 日 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 举 目 远 远 地 看 见 那 地 方 。 [kjv] Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. [bbe] And on the third day, Abraham, lifting up his eyes, saw the place a long way off. 22:5 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 对 他 的 仆 人 说 ， 你 们 和 驴 在 此 等 候 ， 我 与 童 子 往 那 里 去 拜 一 拜 ， 就 回 到 你 们 这 里 来 。 [kjv] And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. [bbe] Then he said to his young men, Keep here with the ass; and I and the boy will go on and give worship and come back again to you. 22:6 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 把 燔 祭 的 柴 放 在 他 儿 子 以 撒 身 上 ， 自 己 手 里 拿 着 火 与 刀 。 于 是 二 人 同 行 。 [kjv] And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. [bbe] And Abraham put the wood for the burned offering on his son\u0027s back, and he himself took the fire and the knife in his hand, and the two of them went on together. 22:7 [hgb] 以 撒 对 他 父 亲 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 父 亲 哪 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 我 儿 ， 我 在 这 里 。 以 撒 说 ， 请 看 ， 火 与 柴 都 有 了 ， 但 燔 祭 的 羊 羔 在 哪 里 呢 ？ [kjv] And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? [bbe] Then Isaac said to Abraham, My father; and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, We have wood and fire here, but where is the lamb for the burned offering? 22:8 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 我 儿 ， 神 必 自 己 预 备 作 燔 祭 的 羊 羔 。 于 是 二 人 同 行 。 [kjv] And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. [bbe] And Abraham said, God himself will give the lamb for the burned offering: so they went on together. 22:9 [hgb] 他 们 到 了 神 所 指 示 的 地 方 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 在 那 里 筑 坛 ， 把 柴 摆 好 ， 捆 绑 他 的 儿 子 以 撒 ， 放 在 坛 的 柴 上 。 [kjv] And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. [bbe] And they came to the place of which God had given him knowledge; and there Abraham made the altar and put the wood in place on it, and having made tight the bands round Isaac his son, he put him on the wood on the altar. 22:10 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 就 伸 手 拿 刀 ， 要 杀 他 的 儿 子 。 [kjv] And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. [bbe] And stretching out his hand, Abraham took the knife to put his son to death. 22:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 从 天 上 呼 叫 他 说 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 他 说 ， 我 在 这 里 。 [kjv] And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. [bbe] But the voice of the angel of the Lord came from heaven, saying, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. 22:12 [hgb] 天 使 说 ， 你 不 可 在 这 童 子 身 上 下 手 。 一 点 不 可 害 他 。 现 在 我 知 道 你 是 敬 畏 神 的 了 。 因 为 你 没 有 将 你 的 儿 子 ， 就 是 你 独 生 的 儿 子 ， 留 下 不 给 我 。 [kjv] And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. [bbe] And he said, Let not your hand be stretched out against the boy to do anything to him; for now I am certain that the fear of God is in your heart, because you have not kept back your son, your only son, from me. 22:13 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 举 目 观 看 ， 不 料 ， 有 一 只 公 羊 ， 两 角 扣 在 稠 密 的 小 树 中 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 就 取 了 那 只 公 羊 来 ， 献 为 燔 祭 ， 代 替 他 的 儿 子 。 [kjv] And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. [bbe] And lifting up his eyes, Abraham saw a sheep fixed by its horns in the brushwood: and Abraham took the sheep and made a burned offering of it in place of his son. 22:14 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 给 那 地 方 起 名 叫 耶 和 华 以 勒 （ 意 思 就 是 耶 和 华 必 预 备 ） ， 直 到 今 日 人 还 说 ， 在 耶 和 华 的 山 上 必 有 预 备 。 [kjv] And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen. [bbe] And Abraham gave that place the name Yahweh-yireh: as it is said to this day, In the mountain the Lord is seen. 22:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 第 二 次 从 天 上 呼 叫 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， [kjv] And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, [bbe] And the voice of the angel of the Lord came to Abraham a second time from heaven, 22:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 既 行 了 这 事 ， 不 留 下 你 的 儿 子 ， 就 是 你 独 生 的 儿 子 ， 我 便 指 着 自 己 起 誓 说 ， [kjv] And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: [bbe] Saying, I have taken an oath by my name, says the Lord, because you have done this and have not kept back from me your dearly loved only son, 22:17 [hgb] 论 福 ， 我 必 赐 大 福 给 你 。 论 子 孙 ， 我 必 叫 你 的 子 孙 多 起 来 ， 如 同 天 上 的 星 ， 海 边 的 沙 。 你 子 孙 必 得 着 仇 敌 的 城 门 ， [kjv] That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; [bbe] That I will certainly give you my blessing, and your seed will be increased like the stars of heaven and the sand by the seaside; your seed will take the land of those who are against them; 22:18 [hgb] 并 且 地 上 万 国 都 必 因 你 的 后 裔 得 福 ， 因 为 你 听 从 了 我 的 话 。 [kjv] And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. [bbe] And your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth, because you have done what I gave you orders to do. 22:19 [hgb] 于 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 回 到 他 仆 人 那 里 ， 他 们 一 同 起 身 往 别 是 巴 去 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 就 住 在 别 是 巴 。 [kjv] So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. [bbe] Then Abraham went back to his young men and they went together to Beer-sheba, the place where Abraham was living. 22:20 [hgb] 这 事 以 后 ， 有 人 告 诉 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 密 迦 给 你 兄 弟 拿 鹤 生 了 几 个 儿 子 ， [kjv] And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; [bbe] After these things, Abraham had news that Milcah, the wife of his brother Nahor, had given birth to children; 22:21 [hgb] 长 子 是 乌 斯 ， 他 的 兄 弟 是 布 斯 和 亚 兰 的 父 亲 基 母 利 ， [kjv] Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, [bbe] Uz the oldest, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel, the father of Aram, 22:22 [hgb] 并 基 薛 ， 哈 琐 ， 必 达 ， 益 拉 ， 彼 土 利 （ 彼 土 利 生 利 百 加 ） 。 [kjv] And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. [bbe] And Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel. 22:23 [hgb] 这 八 个 人 都 是 密 迦 给 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 兄 弟 拿 鹤 生 的 。 [kjv] And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham\u0027s brother. [bbe] Bethuel was the father of Rebekah: these eight were the children of Milcah and Nahor, Abraham\u0027s brother. 22:24 [hgb] 拿 鹤 的 妾 名 叫 流 玛 ， 生 了 提 八 ， 迦 含 ， 他 辖 ， 和 玛 迦 。 [kjv] And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah. [bbe] And his servant Reumah gave birth to Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/371.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
