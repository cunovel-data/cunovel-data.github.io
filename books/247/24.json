{"id":7580,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"24:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 年 纪 老 迈 ， 向 来 在 一 切 事 上 耶 和 华 都 赐 福 给 他 。 [kjv] And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. [bbe] Now Abraham was old and far on in years: and the Lord had given him everything in full measure. 24:2 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 对 管 理 他 全 业 最 老 的 仆 人 说 ， 请 你 把 手 放 在 我 大 腿 底 下 。 [kjv] And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: [bbe] And Abraham said to his chief servant, the manager of all his property, Come now, put your hand under my leg: 24:3 [hgb] 我 要 叫 你 指 着 耶 和 华 天 地 的 主 起 誓 ， 不 要 为 我 儿 子 娶 这 迦 南 地 中 的 女 子 为 妻 。 [kjv] And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: [bbe] And take an oath by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not get a wife for my son Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living; 24:4 [hgb] 你 要 往 我 本 地 本 族 去 ， 为 我 的 儿 子 以 撒 娶 一 个 妻 子 。 [kjv] But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. [bbe] But that you will go into my country and to my relations and get a wife there for my son Isaac. 24:5 [hgb] 仆 人 对 他 说 ， 倘 若 女 子 不 肯 跟 我 到 这 地 方 来 ， 我 必 须 将 你 的 儿 子 带 回 你 原 出 之 地 吗 ？ [kjv] And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? [bbe] And the servant said, If by chance the woman will not come with me into this land, am I to take your son back again to the land from which you came? 24:6 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 对 他 说 ， 你 要 谨 慎 ， 不 要 带 我 的 儿 子 回 那 里 去 。 [kjv] And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. [bbe] And Abraham said, Take care that you do not let my son go back to that land. 24:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 天 上 的 主 曾 带 领 我 离 开 父 家 和 本 族 的 地 ， 对 我 说 话 ， 向 我 起 誓 说 ， 我 要 将 这 地 赐 给 你 的 后 裔 。 他 必 差 遣 使 者 在 你 面 前 ， 你 就 可 以 从 那 里 为 我 儿 子 娶 一 个 妻 子 。 [kjv] The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father\u0027s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. [bbe] The Lord God of heaven, who took me from my father\u0027s house and from the land of my birth, and made an oath to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before you and give you a wife for my son in that land. 24:8 [hgb] 倘 若 女 子 不 肯 跟 你 来 ， 我 使 你 起 的 誓 就 与 你 无 干 了 ， 只 是 不 可 带 我 的 儿 子 回 那 里 去 。 [kjv] And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. [bbe] And if the woman will not come with you, then you are free from this oath; only do not take my son back there. 24:9 [hgb] 仆 人 就 把 手 放 在 他 主 人 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 大 腿 底 下 ， 为 这 事 向 他 起 誓 。 [kjv] And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. [bbe] And the servant put his hand under Abraham\u0027s leg, and gave him his oath about this thing. 24:10 [hgb] 那 仆 人 从 他 主 人 的 骆 驼 里 取 了 十 匹 骆 驼 ， 并 带 些 他 主 人 各 样 的 财 物 ， 起 身 往 米 所 波 大 米 去 ， 到 了 拿 鹤 的 城 。 [kjv] And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. [bbe] And the servant took ten of his master\u0027s camels, and all sorts of good things of his master\u0027s, and went to Mesopotamia, to the town of Nahor. 24:11 [hgb] 天 将 晚 ， 众 女 子 出 来 打 水 的 时 候 ， 他 便 叫 骆 驼 跪 在 城 外 的 水 井 那 里 。 [kjv] And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. [bbe] And he made the camels take their rest outside the town by the water-spring in the evening, at the time when the women came to get water. 24:12 [hgb] 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 我 主 人 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 施 恩 给 我 主 人 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 使 我 今 日 遇 见 好 机 会 。 [kjv] And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. [bbe] And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, let me do well in what I have undertaken this day, and give your mercy to my master Abraham. 24:13 [hgb] 我 现 今 站 在 井 旁 ， 城 内 居 民 的 女 子 们 正 出 来 打 水 。 [kjv] Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: [bbe] See, I am waiting here by the water-spring; and the daughters of the town are coming out to get water: 24:14 [hgb] 我 向 哪 一 个 女 子 说 ， 请 你 拿 下 水 瓶 来 ， 给 我 水 喝 ， 她 若 说 ， 请 喝 ， 我 也 给 你 的 骆 驼 喝 ， 愿 那 女 子 就 作 你 所 预 定 给 你 仆 人 以 撒 的 妻 。 这 样 ， 我 便 知 道 你 施 恩 给 我 主 人 了 。 [kjv] And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. [bbe] Now, may the girl to whom I say, Let down your vessel and give me a drink, and who says in answer, Here is a drink for you and let me give water to your camels: may she be the one marked out by you for your servant Isaac: so may I be certain that you have been good to my master Abraham. 24:15 [hgb] 话 还 没 有 说 完 ， 不 料 ， 利 百 加 肩 头 上 扛 着 水 瓶 出 来 。 利 百 加 是 彼 土 利 所 生 的 。 彼 土 利 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 兄 弟 拿 鹤 妻 子 密 迦 的 儿 子 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham\u0027s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. [bbe] And even before his words were ended, Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, who was the wife of Nahor, Abraham\u0027s brother, came out with her water-vessel on her arm. 24:16 [hgb] 那 女 子 容 貌 极 其 俊 美 ， 还 是 处 女 ， 也 未 曾 有 人 亲 近 她 。 她 下 到 井 旁 ， 打 满 了 瓶 ， 又 上 来 。 [kjv] And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. [bbe] She was a very beautiful girl, a virgin, who had never been touched by a man: and she went down to the spring to get water in her vessel. 24:17 [hgb] 仆 人 跑 上 前 去 迎 着 她 ， 说 ， 求 你 将 瓶 里 的 水 给 我 一 点 喝 。 [kjv] And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. [bbe] And the servant came running to her and said, Give me a little water from your vessel. 24:18 [hgb] 女 子 说 ， 我 主 请 喝 ， 就 急 忙 拿 下 瓶 来 ， 托 在 手 上 给 他 喝 。 [kjv] And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. [bbe] And she said, Take a drink, my lord: and quickly letting down her vessel onto her hand, she gave him a drink. 24:19 [hgb] 女 子 给 他 喝 了 ， 就 说 ， 我 再 为 你 的 骆 驼 打 水 ， 叫 骆 驼 也 喝 足 。 [kjv] And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. [bbe] And having done so, she said, I will get water for your camels till they have had enough. 24:20 [hgb] 她 就 急 忙 把 瓶 里 的 水 倒 在 槽 里 ， 又 跑 到 井 旁 打 水 ， 就 为 所 有 的 骆 驼 打 上 水 来 。 [kjv] And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. [bbe] And after putting the water from her vessel into the animals\u0027 drinking-place, she went quickly back to the spring and got water for all the camels. 24:21 [hgb] 那 人 定 睛 看 她 ， 一 句 话 也 不 说 ， 要 晓 得 耶 和 华 赐 他 通 达 的 道 路 没 有 。 [kjv] And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. [bbe] And the man, looking at her, said nothing, waiting to see if the Lord had given his journey a good outcome. 24:22 [hgb] 骆 驼 喝 足 了 ， 那 人 就 拿 一 个 金 环 ， 重 半 舍 客 勒 ， 两 个 金 镯 ， 重 十 舍 客 勒 ， 给 了 那 女 子 ， [kjv] And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; [bbe] And when the camels had had enough, the man took a gold nose-ring, half a shekel in weight, and two ornaments for her arms of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 [hgb] 说 ， 请 告 诉 我 ， 你 是 谁 的 女 儿 ， 你 父 亲 家 里 有 我 们 住 宿 的 地 方 没 有 。 [kjv] And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father\u0027s house for us to lodge in? [bbe] And said to her, Whose daughter are you? is there room in your father\u0027s house for us? 24:24 [hgb] 女 子 说 ， 我 是 密 迦 与 拿 鹤 之 子 彼 土 利 的 女 儿 。 [kjv] And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. [bbe] And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, Nahor\u0027s wife. 24:25 [hgb] 又 说 ， 我 们 家 里 足 有 粮 草 ， 也 有 住 宿 的 地 方 。 [kjv] She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. [bbe] And she said, We have a great store of dry grass and cattle-food, and there is room for you. 24:26 [hgb] 那 人 就 低 头 向 耶 和 华 下 拜 ， [kjv] And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD. [bbe] And with bent head the man gave worship to the Lord; 24:27 [hgb] 说 ， 耶 和 华 我 主 人 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 神 是 应 当 称 颂 的 ， 因 他 不 断 地 以 慈 爱 诚 实 待 我 主 人 。 至 于 我 ， 耶 和 华 在 路 上 引 领 我 ， 直 走 到 我 主 人 的 兄 弟 家 里 。 [kjv] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master\u0027s brethren. [bbe] And said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has given a sign that he is good and true to my master, by guiding me straight to the house of my master\u0027s family. 24:28 [hgb] 女 子 跑 回 去 ， 照 着 这 些 话 告 诉 她 母 亲 和 她 家 里 的 人 。 [kjv] And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother\u0027s house these things. [bbe] So the girl went running and took the news of these things to her mother\u0027s house 24:29 [hgb] 利 百 加 有 一 个 哥 哥 ， 名 叫 拉 班 ， 看 见 金 环 ， 又 看 见 金 镯 在 他 妹 子 的 手 上 ， 并 听 见 他 妹 子 利 百 加 的 话 ， 说 那 人 对 我 如 此 如 此 说 。 拉 班 就 跑 出 来 往 井 旁 去 ， 到 那 人 跟 前 ， 见 他 仍 站 在 骆 驼 旁 边 的 井 旁 那 里 。 [kjv] And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well. [bbe] Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he came out quickly to the man at the water-spring. 24:30 [hgb] [kjv] And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister\u0027s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. [bbe] And when he saw the nose-ring and the ornaments on his sister\u0027s hands, and when she gave him word of what the man had said to her, then he went out to the man who was waiting with the camels by the water-spring. 24:31 [hgb] 便 对 他 说 ， 你 这 蒙 耶 和 华 赐 福 的 ， 请 进 来 ， 为 什 么 站 在 外 边 ？ 我 已 经 收 拾 了 房 屋 ， 也 为 骆 驼 预 备 了 地 方 。 [kjv] And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels. [bbe] And he said to him, Come in, you on whom is the blessing of the Lord; why are you waiting outside? for I have made the house ready for you, and a place for the camels. 24:32 [hgb] 那 人 就 进 了 拉 班 的 家 。 拉 班 卸 了 骆 驼 ， 用 草 料 喂 上 ， 拿 水 给 那 人 和 跟 随 的 人 洗 脚 ， [kjv] And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men\u0027s feet that were with him. [bbe] Then the man came into the house, and Laban took their cords off the camels and gave them dry grass and food, and he gave to him and the men who were with him water for washing their feet. 24:33 [hgb] 把 饭 摆 在 他 面 前 ， 叫 他 吃 ， 他 却 说 ， 我 不 吃 ， 等 我 说 明 白 我 的 事 情 再 吃 。 拉 班 说 ， 请 说 。 [kjv] And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on. [bbe] And meat was put before him, but he said, I will not take food till I have made my business clear to you. And they said, Do so. 24:34 [hgb] 他 说 ， 我 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 仆 人 。 [kjv] And he said, I am Abraham\u0027s servant. [bbe] And he said, I am Abraham\u0027s servant. 24:35 [hgb] 耶 和 华 大 大 地 赐 福 给 我 主 人 ， 使 他 昌 大 ， 又 赐 给 他 羊 群 ， 牛 群 ， 金 银 ， 仆 婢 ， 骆 驼 ， 和 驴 。 [kjv] And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses. [bbe] The Lord has given my master every blessing, and he has become great: he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold, and men-servants and women-servants and camels and asses. 24:36 [hgb] 我 主 人 的 妻 子 撒 拉 年 老 的 时 候 给 我 主 人 生 了 一 个 儿 子 。 我 主 人 也 将 一 切 所 有 的 都 给 了 这 个 儿 子 。 [kjv] And Sarah my master\u0027s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. [bbe] And when Sarah, my master\u0027s wife, was old, she gave birth to a son, to whom he has given all he has. 24:37 [hgb] 我 主 人 叫 我 起 誓 说 ， 你 不 要 为 我 儿 子 娶 迦 南 地 的 女 子 为 妻 。 [kjv] And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: [bbe] And my master made me take an oath, saying, Do not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living; 24:38 [hgb] 你 要 往 我 父 家 ， 我 本 族 那 里 去 ， 为 我 的 儿 子 娶 一 个 妻 子 。 [kjv] But thou shalt go unto my father\u0027s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. [bbe] But go to my father\u0027s house and to my relations for a wife for my son. 24:39 [hgb] 我 对 我 主 人 说 ， 恐 怕 女 子 不 肯 跟 我 来 。 [kjv] And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. [bbe] And I said to my master, What if the woman will not come with me? 24:40 [hgb] 他 就 说 ， 我 所 事 奉 的 耶 和 华 必 要 差 遣 他 的 使 者 与 你 同 去 ， 叫 你 的 道 路 通 达 ， 你 就 得 以 在 我 父 家 ， 我 本 族 那 里 ， 给 我 的 儿 子 娶 一 个 妻 子 。 [kjv] And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father\u0027s house: [bbe] And he said, The Lord, whom I have ever kept before me, will send his angel with you, who will make it possible for you to get a wife for my son from my relations and my father\u0027s house; 24:41 [hgb] 只 要 你 到 了 我 本 族 那 里 ， 我 使 你 起 的 誓 就 与 你 无 干 。 他 们 若 不 把 女 子 交 给 你 ， 我 使 你 起 的 誓 也 与 你 无 干 。 [kjv] Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath. [bbe] And you will be free from your oath to me when you come to my people; and if they will not give her to you, you will be free from your oath. 24:42 [hgb] 我 今 日 到 了 井 旁 ， 便 说 ， 耶 和 华 我 主 人 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 神 阿 ， 愿 你 叫 我 所 行 的 道 路 通 达 。 [kjv] And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: [bbe] And I came today to the water-spring, and I said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey, 24:43 [hgb] 我 如 今 站 在 井 旁 ， 对 那 一 个 出 来 打 水 的 女 子 说 ， 请 你 把 你 瓶 里 的 水 给 我 一 点 喝 。 [kjv] Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; [bbe] Let it come about that, while I am waiting here by the water-spring, if a girl comes to get water and I say to her, Give me a little water from your vessel, and she says, 24:44 [hgb] 她 若 说 ， 你 只 管 喝 ， 我 也 为 你 的 骆 驼 打 水 。 愿 那 女 子 就 作 耶 和 华 给 我 主 人 儿 子 所 预 定 的 妻 。 [kjv] And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master\u0027s son. [bbe] Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels; let her be the woman marked out by the Lord for my master\u0027s son. 24:45 [hgb] 我 心 里 的 话 还 没 有 说 完 ， 利 百 加 就 出 来 ， 肩 头 上 扛 着 水 瓶 ， 下 到 井 旁 打 水 。 我 便 对 她 说 ， 请 你 给 我 水 喝 。 [kjv] And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. [bbe] And even while I was saying this to myself, Rebekah came out with her vessel on her arm; and she went down to the spring to get water; and I said to her, Give me a drink. 24:46 [hgb] 她 就 急 忙 从 肩 头 上 拿 下 瓶 来 ， 说 ， 请 喝 ， 我 也 给 你 的 骆 驼 喝 。 我 便 喝 了 。 她 又 给 我 的 骆 驼 喝 了 。 [kjv] And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. [bbe] And straight away she took down her vessel from her arm, and said, Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels. 24:47 [hgb] 我 问 她 说 ， 你 是 谁 的 女 儿 ， 她 说 ， 我 是 密 迦 与 拿 鹤 之 子 彼 土 利 的 女 儿 。 我 就 把 环 子 戴 在 她 鼻 子 上 ， 把 镯 子 戴 在 她 两 手 上 。 [kjv] And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor\u0027s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. [bbe] And questioning her, I said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, and Milcah his wife. Then I put the ring on her nose and the ornaments on her hands. 24:48 [hgb] 随 后 我 低 头 向 耶 和 华 下 拜 ， 称 颂 耶 和 华 我 主 人 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 神 。 因 为 他 引 导 我 走 合 式 的 道 路 ， 使 我 得 着 我 主 人 兄 弟 的 孙 女 ， 给 我 主 人 的 儿 子 为 妻 。 [kjv] And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master\u0027s brother\u0027s daughter unto his son. [bbe] And with bent head I gave worship and praise to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, by whom I had been guided in the right way, to get the daughter of my master\u0027s brother for his son. 24:49 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 若 愿 以 慈 爱 诚 实 待 我 主 人 ， 就 告 诉 我 。 若 不 然 ， 也 告 诉 我 ， 使 我 可 以 或 向 左 ， 或 向 右 。 [kjv] And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. [bbe] And now, say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not, in order that it may be clear to me what I have to do. 24:50 [hgb] 拉 班 和 彼 土 利 回 答 说 ， 这 事 乃 出 于 耶 和 华 ， 我 们 不 能 向 你 说 好 说 歹 。 [kjv] Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. [bbe] Then Laban and Bethuel said in answer, This is the Lord\u0027s doing: it is not for us to say Yes or No to you. 24:51 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 利 百 加 在 你 面 前 ， 可 以 将 她 带 去 ， 照 着 耶 和 华 所 说 的 ， 给 你 主 人 的 儿 子 为 妻 。 [kjv] Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master\u0027s son\u0027s wife, as the LORD hath spoken. [bbe] See, here is Rebekah: take her and go, and let her be your master\u0027s son\u0027s wife, as the Lord has said. 24:52 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 仆 人 听 见 他 们 这 话 ， 就 向 耶 和 华 俯 伏 在 地 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, that, when Abraham\u0027s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. [bbe] And at these words, Abraham\u0027s servant went down on his face and gave praise to the Lord. 24:53 [hgb] 当 下 仆 人 拿 出 金 器 ， 银 器 ， 和 衣 服 送 给 利 百 加 ， 又 将 宝 物 送 给 她 哥 哥 和 她 母 亲 。 [kjv] And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. [bbe] Then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to Rebekah: and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother. 24:54 [hgb] 仆 人 和 跟 从 他 的 人 吃 了 喝 了 ， 住 了 一 夜 。 早 晨 起 来 ， 仆 人 就 说 ， 请 打 发 我 回 我 主 人 那 里 去 吧 。 [kjv] And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. [bbe] Then he and the men who were with him had food and drink, and took their rest there that night; and in the morning he got up, and said, Let me now go back to my master. 24:55 [hgb] 利 百 加 的 哥 哥 和 她 母 亲 说 ， 让 女 子 同 我 们 再 住 几 天 ， 至 少 十 天 ， 然 后 她 可 以 去 。 [kjv] And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. [bbe] But her brother and her mother said, Let the girl be with us a week or ten days, and then she may go. 24:56 [hgb] 仆 人 说 ， 耶 和 华 既 赐 给 我 通 达 的 道 路 ， 你 们 不 要 耽 误 我 ， 请 打 发 我 走 ， 回 我 主 人 那 里 去 吧 。 [kjv] And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. [bbe] And he said, Do not keep me; the Lord has given a good outcome to my journey; let me now go back to my master. 24:57 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 我 们 把 女 子 叫 来 问 问 她 。 [kjv] And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. [bbe] And they said, We will send for the girl, and let her make the decision. 24:58 [hgb] 就 叫 了 利 百 加 来 ， 问 她 说 ， 你 和 这 人 同 去 吗 ？ 利 百 加 说 ， 我 去 。 [kjv] And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. [bbe] And they sent for Rebekah and said to her, Are you ready to go with this man? And she said, I am ready. 24:59 [hgb] 于 是 他 们 打 发 妹 子 利 百 加 和 她 的 乳 母 ， 同 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 仆 人 ， 并 跟 从 仆 人 的 ， 都 走 了 。 [kjv] And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham\u0027s servant, and his men. [bbe] So they sent their sister Rebekah and her servant with Abraham\u0027s servant and his men. 24:60 [hgb] 他 们 就 给 利 百 加 祝 福 说 ， 我 们 的 妹 子 阿 ， 愿 你 作 千 万 人 的 母 。 愿 你 的 后 裔 得 着 仇 敌 的 城 门 。 [kjv] And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. [bbe] And they gave Rebekah their blessing, saying, O sister, may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands; and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them. 24:61 [hgb] 利 百 加 和 她 的 使 女 们 起 来 ， 骑 上 骆 驼 ， 跟 着 那 仆 人 ， 仆 人 就 带 着 利 百 加 走 了 。 [kjv] And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. [bbe] So Rebekah and her servant-women went with the man, seated on the camels; and so the servant took Rebekah and went on his way. 24:62 [hgb] 那 时 ， 以 撒 住 在 南 地 ， 刚 从 庇 耳 拉 海 莱 回 来 。 [kjv] And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. [bbe] Now Isaac had come through the waste land to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the South. 24:63 [hgb] 天 将 晚 ， 以 撒 出 来 在 田 间 默 想 ， 举 目 一 看 ， 见 来 了 些 骆 驼 。 [kjv] And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
