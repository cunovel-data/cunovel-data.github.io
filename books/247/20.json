{"id":7576,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"20:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 从 那 里 向 南 地 迁 去 ， 寄 居 在 加 低 斯 和 书 珥 中 间 的 基 拉 耳 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abraham went on his way from there to the land of the South, and was living between Kadesh and Shur, in Gerar. \\n\\n 20:2 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 称 他 的 妻 撒 拉 为 妹 子 ， 基 拉 耳 王 亚 比 米 勒 差 人 把 撒 拉 取 了 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abraham said of Sarah, his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah. \\n\\n 20:3 [hgb] 但 夜 间 神 来 在 梦 中 对 亚 比 米 勒 说 ， 你 是 个 死 人 哪 ， 因 为 你 取 了 那 女 人 来 。 她 原 是 别 人 的 妻 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man\u0027s wife. \\n\\n [bbe] But God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night, and said to him, Truly you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man\u0027s wife. \\n\\n 20:4 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 却 还 没 有 亲 近 撒 拉 。 他 说 ， 主 阿 ， 连 有 义 的 国 ， 你 也 要 毁 灭 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? \\n\\n [bbe] Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, Lord, will you put to death an upright nation? \\n\\n 20:5 [hgb] 那 人 岂 不 是 自 己 对 我 说 ， 她 是 我 的 妹 子 吗 ？ 就 是 女 人 也 自 己 说 ， 他 是 我 的 哥 哥 。 我 作 这 事 是 心 正 手 洁 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. \\n\\n [bbe] Did he not say to me himself, She is my sister? and she herself said, He is my brother: with an upright heart and clean hands have I done this. \\n\\n 20:6 [hgb] 神 在 梦 中 对 他 说 ， 我 知 道 你 作 这 事 是 心 中 正 直 。 我 也 拦 阻 了 你 ， 免 得 你 得 罪 我 ， 所 以 我 不 容 你 沾 着 她 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. \\n\\n [bbe] And God said to him in the dream, I see that you have done this with an upright heart, and I have kept you from sinning against me: for this reason I did not let you come near her. \\n\\n 20:7 [hgb] 现 在 你 把 这 人 的 妻 子 归 还 他 。 因 为 他 是 先 知 ， 他 要 为 你 祷 告 ， 使 你 存 活 。 你 若 不 归 还 他 ， 你 当 知 道 ， 你 和 你 所 有 的 人 都 必 要 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. \\n\\n [bbe] So now, give the man back his wife, for he is a prophet, and let him say a prayer for you, so your life may be safe: but if you do not give her back, be certain that death will come to you and all your house. \\n\\n 20:8 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 清 早 起 来 ， 召 了 众 臣 仆 来 ， 将 这 些 事 都 说 给 他 们 听 ， 他 们 都 甚 惧 怕 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. \\n\\n [bbe] So Abimelech got up early in the morning and sent for all his servants and gave them word of these things, and they were full of fear. \\n\\n 20:9 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 召 了 亚 伯 拉 罕 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 怎 么 向 我 这 样 行 呢 ？ 我 在 什 么 事 上 得 罪 了 你 ， 你 竟 使 我 和 我 国 里 的 人 陷 在 大 罪 里 。 你 向 我 行 不 当 行 的 事 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Abimelech sent for Abraham, and said, What have you done to us? what wrong have I done you that you have put on me and on my kingdom so great a sin? You have done to me things which are not to be done. \\n\\n 20:10 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 又 对 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 你 见 了 什 么 才 作 这 事 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? \\n\\n [bbe] And Abimelech said to Abraham, Why did you do this thing? \\n\\n 20:11 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 我 以 为 这 地 方 的 人 总 不 惧 怕 神 ， 必 为 我 妻 子 的 缘 故 杀 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife\u0027s sake. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abraham said, Because it seemed to me that there was no fear of God in this place, and that they might put me to death because of my wife. \\n\\n 20:12 [hgb] 况 且 她 也 实 在 是 我 的 妹 子 。 她 与 我 是 同 父 异 母 ， 后 来 作 了 我 的 妻 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. \\n\\n [bbe] And, in fact, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife: \\n\\n 20:13 [hgb] 当 神 叫 我 离 开 父 家 ， 飘 流 在 外 的 时 候 ， 我 对 她 说 ， 我 们 无 论 走 到 什 么 地 方 ， 你 可 以 对 人 说 ， 他 是 我 的 哥 哥 。 这 就 是 你 待 我 的 恩 典 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father\u0027s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. \\n\\n [bbe] And when God sent me wandering from my father\u0027s house, I said to her, Let this be the sign of your love for me; wherever we go, say of me, He is my brother. \\n\\n 20:14 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 把 牛 ， 羊 ， 仆 婢 赐 给 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 又 把 他 的 妻 子 撒 拉 归 还 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Abimelech gave to Abraham sheep and oxen and men-servants and women-servants, and gave him back his wife Sarah. \\n\\n 20:15 [hgb] 亚 比 米 勒 又 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 的 地 都 在 你 面 前 ， 你 可 以 随 意 居 住 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abimelech said, See, all my land is before you; take whatever place seems good to you. \\n\\n 20:16 [hgb] 又 对 撒 拉 说 ， 我 给 你 哥 哥 一 千 银 子 ， 作 为 你 在 合 家 人 面 前 遮 羞 的 （ 羞 原 文 作 眼 ） ， 你 就 在 众 人 面 前 没 有 不 是 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to Sarah, See, I have given to your brother a thousand bits of silver so that your wrong may be put right; now your honour is clear in the eyes of all. \\n\\n 20:17 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 祷 告 神 ， 神 就 医 好 了 亚 比 米 勒 和 他 的 妻 子 ， 并 他 的 众 女 仆 ， 她 们 便 能 生 育 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Abraham made prayer to God, and God made Abimelech well again, and his wife and his women-servants, so that they had children. \\n\\n 20:18 [hgb] 因 耶 和 华 为 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 妻 子 撒 拉 的 缘 故 ， 已 经 使 亚 比 米 勒 家 中 的 妇 人 不 能 生 育 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham\u0027s wife. \\n\\n [bbe] For the Lord had kept all the women of the house of Abimelech from having children, because of Sarah, Abraham\u0027s wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/369.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
