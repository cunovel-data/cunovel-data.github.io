[bbe] When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord came to him, and said, I am God, Ruler of all; go in my ways and be upright in all things, 17:2 [hgb] 我 就 与 你 立 约 ， 使 你 的 后 裔 极 其 繁 多 。 [kjv] And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. [bbe] And I will make an agreement between you and me, and your offspring will be greatly increased. 17:3 [hgb] 亚 伯 兰 俯 伏 在 地 。 神 又 对 他 说 ， [kjv] And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, [bbe] And Abram went down on his face on the earth, and the Lord God went on talking with him, and said, 17:4 [hgb] 我 与 你 立 约 ， 你 要 作 多 国 的 父 。 [kjv] As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. [bbe] As for me, my agreement is made with you, and you will be the father of nations without end. 17:5 [hgb] 从 此 以 后 ， 你 的 名 不 再 叫 亚 伯 兰 ， 要 叫 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 因 为 我 已 立 你 作 多 国 的 父 。 [kjv] Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. [bbe] No longer will your name be Abram, but Abraham, for I have made you the father of a number of nations. 17:6 [hgb] 我 必 使 你 的 后 裔 极 其 繁 多 。 国 度 从 你 而 立 ， 君 王 从 你 而 出 。 [kjv] And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. [bbe] I will make you very fertile, so that nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring. 17:7 [hgb] 我 要 与 你 并 你 世 世 代 代 的 后 裔 坚 立 我 的 约 ， 作 永 远 的 约 ， 是 要 作 你 和 你 后 裔 的 神 。 [kjv] And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. [bbe] And I will make between me and you and your seed after you through all generations, an eternal agreement to be a God to you and to your seed after you. 17:8 [hgb] 我 要 将 你 现 在 寄 居 的 地 ， 就 是 迦 南 全 地 ， 赐 给 你 和 你 的 后 裔 永 远 为 业 ， 我 也 必 作 他 们 的 神 。 [kjv] And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. [bbe] And to you and to your seed after you, I will give the land in which you are living, all the land of Canaan for an eternal heritage; and I will be their God. 17:9 [hgb] 神 又 对 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 你 和 你 的 后 裔 ， 必 世 世 代 代 遵 守 我 的 约 。 [kjv] And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. [bbe] And God said to Abraham, On your side, you are to keep the agreement, you and your seed after you through all generations. 17:10 [hgb] 你 们 所 有 的 男 子 ， 都 要 受 割 礼 。 这 就 是 我 与 你 ， 并 你 的 后 裔 所 立 的 约 ， 是 你 们 所 当 遵 守 的 。 [kjv] This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. [bbe] And this is the agreement which you are to keep with me, you and your seed after you: every male among you is to undergo circumcision. 17:11 [hgb] 你 们 都 要 受 割 礼 （ 受 割 礼 原 文 作 割 阳 皮 。 14 ， 23 ， 24 ， 25节 同 ） ， 这 是 我 与 你 们 立 约 的 证 据 。 [kjv] And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. [bbe] In the flesh of your private parts you are to undergo it, as a mark of the agreement between me and you. 17:12 [hgb] 你 们 世 世 代 代 的 男 子 ， 无 论 是 家 里 生 的 ， 是 在 你 后 裔 之 外 用 银 子 从 外 人 买 的 ， 生 下 来 第 八 日 ， 都 要 受 割 礼 。 [kjv] And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. [bbe] Every male among you, from one generation to another, is to undergo circumcision when he is eight days old, with every servant whose birth takes place in your house, or for whom you gave money to someone of another country, and not of your seed. 17:13 [hgb] 你 家 里 生 的 和 你 用 银 子 买 的 ， 都 必 须 受 割 礼 。 这 样 ， 我 的 约 就 立 在 你 们 肉 体 上 作 永 远 的 约 。 [kjv] He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. [bbe] He who comes to birth in your house and he who is made yours for a price, all are to undergo circumcision; so that my agreement may be marked in your flesh, an agreement for all time. 17:14 [hgb] 但 不 受 割 礼 的 男 子 ， 必 从 民 中 剪 除 ， 因 他 背 了 我 的 约 。 [kjv] And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant. [bbe] And any male who does not undergo circumcision will be cut off from his people: my agreement has been broken by him. 17:15 [hgb] 神 又 对 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 你 的 妻 子 撒 莱 ， 不 可 再 叫 撒 莱 ， 她 的 名 要 叫 撒 拉 。 [kjv] And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. [bbe] And God said, As for Sarai, your wife, from now her name will be not Sarai, but Sarah. 17:16 [hgb] 我 必 赐 福 给 她 ， 也 要 使 你 从 她 得 一 个 儿 子 。 我 要 赐 福 给 她 ， 她 也 要 作 多 国 之 母 。 必 有 百 姓 的 君 王 从 她 而 出 。 [kjv] And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her. [bbe] And I will give her a blessing so that you will have a son by her: truly my blessing will be on her, and she will be the mother of nations: kings of peoples will be her offspring. 17:17 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 就 俯 伏 在 地 喜 笑 ， 心 里 说 ， 一 百 岁 的 人 还 能 得 孩 子 吗 ？ 撒 拉 已 经 九 十 岁 了 ， 还 能 生 养 吗 ？ [kjv] Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? [bbe] Then Abraham went down on his face, and laughing, said in his heart, May a man a hundred years old have a child? will Sarah, at ninety years old, give birth? 17:18 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 对 神 说 ， 但 愿 以 实 玛 利 活 在 你 面 前 。 [kjv] And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! [bbe] And Abraham said to God, If only Ishmael\u0027s life might be your care! 17:19 [hgb] 神 说 ， 不 然 ， 你 妻 子 撒 拉 要 给 你 生 一 个 儿 子 ， 你 要 给 他 起 名 叫 以 撒 。 我 要 与 他 坚 定 所 立 的 约 ， 作 他 后 裔 永 远 的 约 。 [kjv] And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. [bbe] And God said, Not so; but Sarah, your wife, will have a son, and you will give him the name Isaac, and I will make my agreement with him for ever and with his seed after him. 17:20 [hgb] 至 于 以 实 玛 利 ， 我 也 应 允 你 ， 我 必 赐 福 给 他 ， 使 他 昌 盛 极 其 繁 多 ， 他 必 生 十 二 个 族 长 ， 我 也 要 使 他 成 为 大 国 。 [kjv] And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. [bbe] As for Ishmael, I have given ear to your prayer: truly I have given him my blessing and I will make him fertile and give him great increase; he will be the father of twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation. 17:21 [hgb] 到 明 年 这 时 节 ， 撒 拉 必 给 你 生 以 撒 ， 我 要 与 他 坚 定 所 立 的 约 。 [kjv] But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. [bbe] But my agreement will be with Isaac, to whom Sarah will give birth a year from this time. 17:22 [hgb] 神 和 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 完 了 话 ， 就 离 开 他 上 升 去 了 。 [kjv] And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. [bbe] And having said these words, God went up from Abraham. 17:23 [hgb] 正 当 那 日 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 遵 着 神 的 命 ， 给 他 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 和 家 里 的 一 切 男 子 ， 无 论 是 在 家 里 生 的 ， 是 用 银 子 买 的 ， 都 行 了 割 礼 。 [kjv] And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham\u0027s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. [bbe] And Abraham took Ishmael, his son, and all whose birth had taken place in his house, and all his servants whom he had made his for a price, every male of his house, and on that very day he gave them circumcision in the flesh of their private parts as God had said to him. 17:24 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 受 割 礼 的 时 候 ， 年 九 十 九 岁 。 [kjv] And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. [bbe] Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he underwent circumcision. 17:25 [hgb] 他 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 受 割 礼 的 时 候 ， 年 十 三 岁 。 [kjv] And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. [bbe] And Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he underwent circumcision. 17:26 [hgb] 正 当 那 日 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 和 他 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 ， 一 同 受 了 割 礼 。 [kjv] In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. [bbe] Abraham and Ishmael, his son, underwent circumcision on that very day. 17:27 [hgb] 家 里 所 有 的 人 ， 无 论 是 在 家 里 生 的 ， 是 用 银 子 从 外 人 买 的 ， 也 都 一 同 受 了 割 礼 。 [kjv] And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him. [bbe] And all the men of his house, those whose birth had taken place in the house and those whom he had got for money from men of other lands, underwent circumcision with him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/366.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
