And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. \n [bbe] And when Joseph saw his brothers, it was clear to him who they were, but he made himself strange to them, and talking roughly to them, said, Where do you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to get food. \n 42:8 [hgb] 约 瑟 认 得 他 哥 哥 们 ， 他 们 却 不 认 得 他 。 \n [kjv] And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. \n [bbe] Now though Joseph saw that these were his brothers, they had no idea who he was. \n 42:9 [hgb] 约 瑟 想 起 从 前 所 作 的 那 两 个 梦 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 是 奸 细 ， 来 窥 探 这 地 的 虚 实 。 \n [kjv] And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. \n [bbe] Then the memory of his dreams about them came back to Joseph, and he said to them, You have come secretly to see how poor the land is. \n 42:10 [hgb] 他 们 对 他 说 ， 我 主 阿 ， 不 是 的 。 仆 人 们 是 籴 粮 来 的 。 \n [kjv] And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. \n [bbe] And they said to him, Not so, my lord: your servants have come with money to get food. \n 42:11 [hgb] 我 们 都 是 一 个 人 的 儿 子 ， 是 诚 实 人 。 仆 人 们 并 不 是 奸 细 。 \n [kjv] We are all one man\u0027s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. \n [bbe] We are all one man\u0027s sons, we are true men; we have not come with any secret purpose. \n 42:12 [hgb] 约 瑟 说 ， 不 然 ， 你 们 必 是 窥 探 这 地 的 虚 实 来 的 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. \n [bbe] And he said to them, No, but you have come to see how poor the land is. \n 42:13 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 仆 人 们 本 是 弟 兄 十 二 人 ， 是 迦 南 地 一 个 人 的 儿 子 ， 顶 小 的 现 今 在 我 们 的 父 亲 那 里 ， 有 一 个 没 有 了 。 \n [kjv] And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. \n [bbe] Then they said, We your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest of us is now with our father, and one is dead. \n 42:14 [hgb] 约 瑟 说 ， 我 才 说 你 们 是 奸 细 ， 这 话 实 在 不 错 。 \n [kjv] And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: \n [bbe] And Joseph said, It is as I said; you have come with some secret purpose; \n 42:15 [hgb] 我 指 着 法 老 的 性 命 起 誓 ， 若 是 你 们 的 小 兄 弟 不 到 这 里 来 ， 你 们 就 不 得 出 这 地 方 ， 从 此 就 可 以 把 你 们 证 验 出 来 了 。 \n [kjv] Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. \n [bbe] But in this way will you be put to the test: by the life of Pharaoh, you will not go away from this place till your youngest brother comes here. \n 42:16 [hgb] 须 要 打 发 你 们 中 间 一 个 人 去 ， 把 你 们 的 兄 弟 带 来 。 至 于 你 们 ， 都 要 囚 在 这 里 ， 好 证 验 你 们 的 话 真 不 真 ， 若 不 真 ， 我 指 着 法 老 的 性 命 起 誓 ， 你 们 一 定 是 奸 细 。 \n [kjv] Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. \n [bbe] Send one of your number to get your brother, and the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are true; if not, by the life of Pharaoh, your purpose is certainly secret. \n 42:17 [hgb] 于 是 约 瑟 把 他 们 都 下 在 监 里 三 天 。 \n [kjv] And he put them all together into ward three days. \n [bbe] So he put them in prison for three days. \n 42:18 [hgb] 到 了 第 三 天 ， 约 瑟 对 他 们 说 ， 我 是 敬 畏 神 的 。 你 们 照 我 的 话 行 就 可 以 存 活 。 \n [kjv] And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: \n [bbe] And on the third day Joseph said to them, Do this, if you would keep your lives: for I am a god-fearing man: \n 42:19 [hgb] 你 们 如 果 是 诚 实 人 ， 可 以 留 你 们 中 间 的 一 个 人 囚 在 监 里 ， 但 你 们 可 以 带 着 粮 食 回 去 ， 救 你 们 家 里 的 饥 荒 。 \n [kjv] If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: \n [bbe] If you are true men, let one of you be kept in prison, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families; \n 42:20 [hgb] 把 你 们 的 小 兄 弟 带 到 我 这 里 来 ， 如 此 ， 你 们 的 话 便 有 证 据 ， 你 们 也 不 至 于 死 。 他 们 就 照 样 而 行 。 \n [kjv] But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. \n [bbe] And come back to me with your youngest brother, so that your words may be seen to be true, and you will not be put to death. This is what you are to do. \n 42:21 [hgb] 他 们 彼 此 说 ， 我 们 在 兄 弟 身 上 实 在 有 罪 。 他 哀 求 我 们 的 时 候 ， 我 们 见 他 心 里 的 愁 苦 ， 却 不 肯 听 ， 所 以 这 场 苦 难 临 到 我 们 身 上 。 \n [kjv] And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. \n [bbe] And they said to one another, Truly, we did wrong to our brother, for we saw his grief of mind, and we did not give ear to his prayers; that is why this trouble has come on us. \n 42:22 [hgb] 流 便 说 ， 我 岂 不 是 对 你 们 说 过 ， 不 可 伤 害 那 孩 子 吗 ？ 只 是 你 们 不 肯 听 ， 所 以 流 他 血 的 罪 向 我 们 追 讨 。 \n [kjv] And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. \n [bbe] And Reuben said to them, Did I not say to you, Do the child no wrong? but you gave no attention; so now, punishment has come on us for his blood. \n 42:23 [hgb] 他 们 不 知 道 约 瑟 听 得 出 来 ， 因 为 在 他 们 中 间 用 通 事 传 话 。 \n [kjv] And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. \n [bbe] They were not conscious that the sense of their words was clear to Joseph, for he had been talking to them through one who had knowledge of their language. \n 42:24 [hgb] 约 瑟 转 身 退 去 ， 哭 了 一 场 ， 又 回 来 对 他 们 说 话 ， 就 从 他 们 中 间 挑 出 西 缅 来 ， 在 他 们 眼 前 把 他 捆 绑 。 \n [kjv] And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. \n [bbe] And turning away from them, he was overcome with weeping; then he went on talking to them again and took Simeon and put chains on him before their eyes. \n 42:25 [hgb] 约 瑟 吩 咐 人 把 粮 食 装 满 他 们 的 器 具 ， 把 各 人 的 银 子 归 还 在 各 人 的 口 袋 里 ， 又 给 他 们 路 上 用 的 食 物 ， 人 就 照 他 的 话 办 了 。 \n [kjv] Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man\u0027s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. \n [bbe] Then Joseph gave orders for their bags to be made full of grain, and for every man\u0027s money to be put back into his bag, and for food to be given them for the journey: which was done. \n 42:26 [hgb] 他 们 就 把 粮 食 驮 在 驴 上 ， 离 开 那 里 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. \n [bbe] Then they put the bags of grain on their asses and went away. \n 42:27 [hgb] 到 了 住 宿 的 地 方 ， 他 们 中 间 有 一 个 人 打 开 口 袋 ， 要 拿 料 喂 驴 ， 才 看 见 自 己 的 银 子 仍 在 口 袋 里 ， \n [kjv] And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack\u0027s mouth. \n [bbe] Now at their night\u0027s resting-place one of them, opening his bag to give his ass some food, saw his money in the mouth of the bag. \n 42:28 [hgb] 就 对 弟 兄 们 说 ， 我 的 银 子 归 还 了 ， 看 哪 ， 仍 在 我 口 袋 里 。 他 们 就 提 心 吊 胆 ， 战 战 兢 兢 地 彼 此 说 ， 这 是 神 向 我 们 作 什 么 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? \n [bbe] And he said to his brothers, My money has been given back: it is in my bag; then their hearts became full of fear, and turning to one another they said, What is this which God has done to us? \n 42:29 [hgb] 他 们 来 到 迦 南 地 ， 他 们 的 父 亲 雅 各 那 里 ， 将 所 遭 遇 的 事 都 告 诉 他 ， 说 ， \n [kjv] And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, \n [bbe] So when they came to Jacob their father, in the land of Canaan, they gave him an account of all their experiences, saying, \n 42:30 [hgb] 那 地 的 主 对 我 们 说 严 厉 的 话 ， 把 我 们 当 作 窥 探 那 地 的 奸 细 。 \n [kjv] The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. \n [bbe] The man who is the ruler of the country was rough with us and put us in prison, saying that we had come with a secret evil purpose. \n 42:31 [hgb] 我 们 对 他 说 ， 我 们 是 诚 实 人 ， 并 不 是 奸 细 。 \n [kjv] And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: \n [bbe] And we said to him, We are true men, we have no evil designs; \n 42:32 [hgb] 我 们 本 是 弟 兄 十 二 人 ， 都 是 一 个 父 亲 的 儿 子 ， 有 一 个 没 有 了 ， 顶 小 的 如 今 同 我 们 的 父 亲 在 迦 南 地 。 \n [kjv] We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. \n [bbe] We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is dead, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan. \n 42:33 [hgb] 那 地 的 主 对 我 们 说 ， 若 要 我 知 道 你 们 是 诚 实 人 ， 可 以 留 下 你 们 中 间 的 一 个 人 在 我 这 里 ， 你 们 可 以 带 着 粮 食 回 去 ， 救 你 们 家 里 的 饥 荒 。 \n [kjv] And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: \n [bbe] And the ruler of the land said, In this way I may be certain that you are true men; let one of you be kept here with me, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families; \n 42:34 [hgb] 把 你 们 的 小 兄 弟 带 到 我 这 里 来 ， 我 便 知 道 你 们 不 是 奸 细 ， 乃 是 诚 实 人 。 这 样 ， 我 就 把 你 们 的 弟 兄 交 给 你 们 ， 你 们 也 可 以 在 这 地 作 买 卖 。 \n [kjv] And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. \n [bbe] And come back to me with your youngest brother: then I will be certain that you are true men, and I will give your brother back to you and let you do trade in the land. \n 42:35 [hgb] 后 来 他 们 倒 口 袋 ， 不 料 ， 各 人 的 银 包 都 在 口 袋 里 。 他 们 和 父 亲 看 见 银 包 就 都 害 怕 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man\u0027s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. \n [bbe] And when they took the grain out of their bags, it was seen that every man\u0027s parcel of money was in his bag; and when they and their father saw the money, they were full of fear. \n 42:36 [hgb] 他 们 的 父 亲 雅 各 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 使 我 丧 失 我 的 儿 子 ， 约 瑟 没 有 了 ， 西 缅 也 没 有 了 ， 你 们 又 要 将 便 雅 悯 带 去 。 这 些 事 都 归 到 我 身 上 了 。 \n [kjv] And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. \n [bbe] And Jacob their father said to them, You have taken my children from me: Joseph is gone and Simeon is gone, and now you would take Benjamin away; all these things have come on me. \n 42:37 [hgb] 流 便 对 他 父 亲 说 ， 我 若 不 带 他 回 来 交 给 你 ， 你 可 以 杀 我 的 两 个 儿 子 。 只 管 把 他 交 在 我 手 里 ， 我 必 带 他 回 来 交 给 你 。 \n [kjv] And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. \n [bbe] And Reuben said, Put my two sons to death if I do not come back to you with him; let him be in my care and I will give him safely back to you. \n 42:38 [hgb] 雅 各 说 ， 我 的 儿 子 不 可 与 你 们 一 同 下 去 。 他 哥 哥 死 了 ， 只 剩 下 他 ， 他 若 在 你 们 所 行 的 路 上 遭 害 ， 那 便 是 你 们 使 我 白 发 苍 苍 ， 悲 悲 惨 惨 地 下 阴 间 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. \n [bbe] And he said, I will not let my son go down with you; for his brother is dead and he is all I have: if evil overtakes him on the journey, then through you will my grey head go down to the underworld in sorrow. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/391.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
