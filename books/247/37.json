{"id":7593,"no":37,"title":"Chapter 37","content":"37:1 [hgb] 雅 各 住 在 迦 南 地 ， 就 是 他 父 亲 寄 居 的 地 。 \n [kjv] And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. \n [bbe] Now Jacob was living in the land where his father had made a place for himself, in the land of Canaan. \n 37:2 [hgb] 雅 各 的 记 略 如 下 。 约 瑟 十 七 岁 与 他 哥 哥 们 一 同 牧 羊 。 他 是 个 童 子 ， 与 他 父 亲 的 妾 辟 拉 ， 悉 帕 的 儿 子 们 常 在 一 处 。 约 瑟 将 他 哥 哥 们 的 恶 行 报 给 他 们 的 父 亲 。 \n [kjv] These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father\u0027s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. \n [bbe] These are the generations of Jacob: Joseph, a boy seventeen years old, was looking after the flock, together with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father\u0027s wives; and Joseph gave their father a bad account of them. \n 37:3 [hgb] 以 色 列 原 来 爱 约 瑟 过 于 爱 他 的 众 子 ， 因 为 约 瑟 是 他 年 老 生 的 。 他 给 约 瑟 作 了 一 件 彩 衣 。 \n [kjv] Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. \n [bbe] Now the love which Israel had for Joseph was greater than his love for all his other children, because he got him when he was an old man: and he had a long coat made for him. \n 37:4 [hgb] 约 瑟 的 哥 哥 们 见 父 亲 爱 约 瑟 过 于 爱 他 们 ， 就 恨 约 瑟 ， 不 与 他 说 和 睦 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. \n [bbe] And because his brothers saw that Joseph was dearer to his father than all the others, they were full of hate for him, and would not say a kind word to him. \n 37:5 [hgb] 约 瑟 作 了 一 梦 ， 告 诉 他 哥 哥 们 ， 他 们 就 越 发 恨 他 。 \n [kjv] And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. \n [bbe] Now Joseph had a dream, and he gave his brothers an account of it, which made their hate greater than ever. \n 37:6 [hgb] 约 瑟 对 他 们 说 ， 请 听 我 所 作 的 梦 ， \n [kjv] And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: \n [bbe] And he said to them, Let me give you the story of my dream. \n 37:7 [hgb] 我 们 在 田 里 捆 禾 稼 ， 我 的 捆 起 来 站 着 ， 你 们 的 捆 来 围 着 我 的 捆 下 拜 。 \n [kjv] For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. \n [bbe] We were in the field, getting the grain stems together, and my grain kept upright, and yours came round and went down on the earth before mine. \n 37:8 [hgb] 他 的 哥 哥 们 回 答 说 ， 难 道 你 真 要 作 我 们 的 王 吗 ？ 难 道 你 真 要 管 辖 我 们 吗 ？ 他 们 就 因 为 他 的 梦 和 他 的 话 越 发 恨 他 。 \n [kjv] And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. \n [bbe] And his brothers said to him, Are you to be our king? will you have authority over us? And because of his dream and his words, their hate for him became greater than ever. \n 37:9 [hgb] 后 来 他 又 作 了 一 梦 ， 也 告 诉 他 的 哥 哥 们 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 又 作 了 一 梦 ， 梦 见 太 阳 ， 月 亮 ， 与 十 一 个 星 向 我 下 拜 。 \n [kjv] And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. \n [bbe] Then he had another dream, and gave his brothers an account of it, saying, I have had another dream: the sun and the moon and eleven stars gave honour to me. \n 37:10 [hgb] 约 瑟 将 这 梦 告 诉 他 父 亲 和 他 哥 哥 们 ， 他 父 亲 就 责 备 他 说 ， 你 作 的 这 是 什 么 梦 。 难 道 我 和 你 母 亲 ， 你 弟 兄 果 然 要 来 俯 伏 在 地 ， 向 你 下 拜 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? \n [bbe] And he gave word of it to his father and his brothers; but his father protesting said, What sort of a dream is this? am I and your mother and your brothers to go down on our faces to the earth before you? \n 37:11 [hgb] 他 哥 哥 们 都 嫉 妒 他 ， 他 父 亲 却 把 这 话 存 在 心 里 。 \n [kjv] And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. \n [bbe] And his brothers were full of envy; but his father kept his words in mind. \n 37:12 [hgb] 约 瑟 的 哥 哥 们 往 示 剑 去 放 他 们 父 亲 的 羊 。 \n [kjv] And his brethren went to feed their father\u0027s flock in Shechem. \n [bbe] Now his brothers went to keep watch over their father\u0027s flock in Shechem. \n 37:13 [hgb] 以 色 列 对 约 瑟 说 ， 你 哥 哥 们 不 是 在 示 剑 放 羊 吗 ？ 你 来 ， 我 要 打 发 你 往 他 们 那 里 去 。 约 瑟 说 ， 我 在 这 里 。 \n [kjv] And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. \n [bbe] And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers with the flock in Shechem? come, I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here am I. \n 37:14 [hgb] 以 色 列 说 ， 你 去 看 看 你 哥 哥 们 平 安 不 平 安 ， 群 羊 平 安 不 平 安 ， 就 回 来 报 信 给 我 。 于 是 打 发 他 出 希 伯 仑 谷 ， 他 就 往 示 剑 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. \n [bbe] And he said to him, Go now, and see if your brothers are well and how the flock is; then come back and give me word. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. \n 37:15 [hgb] 有 人 遇 见 他 在 田 野 走 迷 了 路 ， 就 问 他 说 ， 你 找 什 么 ？ \n [kjv] And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? \n [bbe] And a man saw him wandering in the country, and said to him, What are you looking for? \n 37:16 [hgb] 他 说 ， 我 找 我 的 哥 哥 们 ， 求 你 告 诉 我 ， 他 们 在 何 处 放 羊 。 \n [kjv] And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks. \n [bbe] And he said, I am looking for my brothers; please give me word of where they are keeping their flock. \n 37:17 [hgb] 那 人 说 ， 他 们 已 经 走 了 ， 我 听 见 他 们 说 要 往 多 坍 去 。 约 瑟 就 去 追 赶 他 哥 哥 们 ， 遇 见 他 们 在 多 坍 。 \n [kjv] And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. \n [bbe] And the man said, They have gone away from here, for they said in my hearing, Let us go to Dothan. So Joseph went after them and came up with them at Dothan. \n 37:18 [hgb] 他 们 远 远 地 看 见 他 ， 趁 他 还 没 有 走 到 跟 前 ， 大 家 就 同 谋 要 害 死 他 ， \n [kjv] And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. \n [bbe] But they saw him when he was a long way off, and before he came near them they made a secret design against him to put him to death; \n 37:19 [hgb] 彼 此 说 ， 你 看 。 那 作 梦 的 来 了 。 \n [kjv] And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. \n [bbe] Saying to one another, See, here comes this dreamer. \n 37:20 [hgb] 来 吧 。 我 们 将 他 杀 了 ， 丢 在 一 个 坑 里 ， 就 说 有 恶 兽 把 他 吃 了 。 我 们 且 看 他 的 梦 将 来 怎 么 样 。 \n [kjv] Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. \n [bbe] Let us now put him to death and put his body into one of these holes, and we will say, An evil beast has put him to death: then we will see what becomes of his dreams. \n 37:21 [hgb] 流 便 听 见 了 ， 要 救 他 脱 离 他 们 的 手 ， 说 ， 我 们 不 可 害 他 的 性 命 。 \n [kjv] And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. \n [bbe] But Reuben, hearing these words, got him out of their hands, saying, Let us not take his life. \n 37:22 [hgb] 又 说 ， 不 可 流 他 的 血 ， 可 以 把 他 丢 在 这 野 地 的 坑 里 ， 不 可 下 手 害 他 。 流 便 的 意 思 是 要 救 他 脱 离 他 们 的 手 ， 把 他 归 还 他 的 父 亲 。 \n [kjv] And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. \n [bbe] Do not put him to a violent death, but let him be placed in one of the holes; this he said to keep him safe from their hands, with the purpose of taking him back to his father again. \n 37:23 [hgb] 约 瑟 到 了 他 哥 哥 们 那 里 ， 他 们 就 剥 了 他 的 外 衣 ， 就 是 他 穿 的 那 件 彩 衣 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; \n [bbe] So when Joseph came to his brothers, they took off his long coat which he had on; \n 37:24 [hgb] 把 他 丢 在 坑 里 。 那 坑 是 空 的 ， 里 头 没 有 水 。 \n [kjv] And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. \n [bbe] And they took him and put him in the hole: now the hole had no water in it. \n 37:25 [hgb] 他 们 坐 下 吃 饭 ， 举 目 观 看 ， 见 有 一 伙 米 甸 的 以 实 玛 利 人 从 基 列 来 ， 用 骆 驼 驮 着 香 料 ， 乳 香 ， 没 药 ， 要 带 下 埃 及 去 。 \n [kjv] And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. \n [bbe] Then seating themselves, they took their meal: and looking up, they saw a travelling band of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead on their way to Egypt, with spices and perfumes on their camels. \n 37:26 [hgb] 犹 大 对 众 弟 兄 说 ， 我 们 杀 我 们 的 兄 弟 ， 藏 了 他 的 血 有 什 么 益 处 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? \n [bbe] And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is there in putting our brother to death and covering up his blood? \n 37:27 [hgb] 我 们 不 如 将 他 卖 给 以 实 玛 利 人 ， 不 可 下 手 害 他 。 因 为 他 是 我 们 的 兄 弟 ， 我 们 的 骨 肉 。 众 弟 兄 就 听 从 了 他 。 \n [kjv] Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content. \n [bbe] Let us give him to these Ishmaelites for a price, and let us not put violent hands on him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers gave ear to him. \n 37:28 [hgb] 有 些 米 甸 的 商 人 从 那 里 经 过 ， 哥 哥 们 就 把 约 瑟 从 坑 里 拉 上 来 ， 讲 定 二 十 舍 客 勒 银 子 ， 把 约 瑟 卖 给 以 实 玛 利 人 。 他 们 就 把 约 瑟 带 到 埃 及 去 了 。 \n [kjv] Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. \n [bbe] And some traders from Midian went by; so pulling Joseph up out of the hole, they gave him to the Ishmaelites for twenty bits of silver, and they took him to Egypt. \n 37:29 [hgb] 流 便 回 到 坑 边 ， 见 约 瑟 不 在 坑 里 ， 就 撕 裂 衣 服 ， \n [kjv] And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. \n [bbe] Now when Reuben came back to the hole, Joseph was not there; and giving signs of grief, \n 37:30 [hgb] 回 到 兄 弟 们 那 里 ， 说 ， 童 子 没 有 了 。 我 往 哪 里 去 才 好 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? \n [bbe] He went back to his brothers, and said, The child is gone; what am I to do? \n 37:31 [hgb] 他 们 宰 了 一 只 公 山 羊 ， 把 约 瑟 的 那 件 彩 衣 染 了 血 ， \n [kjv] And they took Joseph\u0027s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; \n [bbe] Then they took Joseph\u0027s coat, and put on it some of the blood from a young goat which they had put to death, \n 37:32 [hgb] 打 发 人 送 到 他 们 的 父 亲 那 里 ， 说 ， 我 们 捡 了 这 个 。 请 认 一 认 是 你 儿 子 的 外 衣 不 是 ， \n [kjv] And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son\u0027s coat or no. \n [bbe] And they took the coat to their father, and said, We came across this; is it your son\u0027s coat or not? \n 37:33 [hgb] 他 认 得 ， 就 说 ， 这 是 我 儿 子 的 外 衣 。 有 恶 兽 把 他 吃 了 ， 约 瑟 被 撕 碎 了 。 撕 碎 了 。 \n [kjv] And he knew it, and said, It is my son\u0027s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. \n [bbe] And he saw that it was, and said, It is my son\u0027s coat; an evil beast has put him to death; without doubt Joseph has come to a cruel end. \n 37:34 [hgb] 雅 各 便 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 腰 间 围 上 麻 布 ， 为 他 儿 子 悲 哀 了 多 日 。 \n [kjv] And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. \n [bbe] Then Jacob, giving signs of grief, put on haircloth, and went on weeping for his son day after day. \n 37:35 [hgb] 他 的 儿 女 都 起 来 安 慰 他 ， 他 却 不 肯 受 安 慰 ， 说 ， 我 必 悲 哀 着 下 阴 间 ， 到 我 儿 子 那 里 。 约 瑟 的 父 亲 就 为 他 哀 哭 。 \n [kjv] And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. \n [bbe] And all his sons and all his daughters came to give him comfort, but he would not be comforted, saying with weeping, I will go down to the underworld to my son. So great was his father\u0027s sorrow for him. \n 37:36 [hgb] 米 甸 人 带 约 瑟 到 埃 及 ， 把 他 卖 给 法 老 的 内 臣 护 卫 长 波 提 乏 。 \n [kjv] And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh\u0027s, and captain of the guard. \n [bbe] And in Egypt the men of Midian gave him for a price to Potiphar, a captain of high position in Pharaoh\u0027s house. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/386.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
