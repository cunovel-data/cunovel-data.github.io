[bbe] They made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar). 14:3 [hgb] 这 五 王 都 在 西 订 谷 会 合 。 西 订 谷 就 是 盐 海 。 [kjv] All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. [bbe] All these came together in the valley of Siddim (which is the Salt Sea). 14:4 [hgb] 他 们 已 经 事 奉 基 大 老 玛 十 二 年 ， 到 十 三 年 就 背 叛 了 。 [kjv] Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. [bbe] For twelve years they were under the rule of Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they put off his control. 14:5 [hgb] 十 四 年 ， 基 大 老 玛 和 同 盟 的 王 都 来 在 亚 特 律 加 宁 ， 杀 败 了 利 乏 音 人 ， 在 哈 麦 杀 败 了 苏 西 人 ， 在 沙 微 基 列 亭 杀 败 了 以 米 人 ， [kjv] And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim, [bbe] And in the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings who were on his side, overcame the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 14:6 [hgb] 在 何 利 人 的 西 珥 山 杀 败 了 何 利 人 ， 一 直 杀 到 靠 近 旷 野 的 伊 勒 巴 兰 。 [kjv] And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness. [bbe] And the Horites in their mountain Seir, driving them as far as El-paran, which is near the waste land. 14:7 [hgb] 他 们 回 到 安 密 巴 ， 就 是 加 低 斯 ， 杀 败 了 亚 玛 力 全 地 的 人 ， 以 及 住 在 哈 洗 逊 他 玛 的 亚 摩 利 人 。 [kjv] And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar. [bbe] Then they came back to En-mishpat (which is Kadesh), making waste all the country of the Amalekites and of the Amorites living in Hazazon-tamar. 14:8 [hgb] 于 是 所 多 玛 王 ， 蛾 摩 拉 王 ， 押 玛 王 ， 洗 扁 王 ， 和 比 拉 王 （ 比 拉 就 是 琐 珥 ） 都 出 来 ， 在 西 订 谷 摆 阵 ， 与 他 们 交 战 ， [kjv] And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim; [bbe] And the king of Sodom with the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is Zoar), went out, and put their forces in position in the valley of Siddim, 14:9 [hgb] 就 是 与 以 拦 王 基 大 老 玛 ， 戈 印 王 提 达 ， 示 拿 王 暗 拉 非 ， 以 拉 撒 王 亚 略 交 战 。 乃 是 四 王 与 五 王 交 战 。 [kjv] With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five. [bbe] Against Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim, and Amraphel, king of Shinar, and Arioch, king of Ellasar: four kings against the five. 14:10 [hgb] 西 订 谷 有 许 多 石 漆 坑 。 所 多 玛 王 和 蛾 摩 拉 王 逃 跑 ， 有 掉 在 坑 里 的 ， 其 余 的 人 都 往 山 上 逃 跑 。 [kjv] And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. [bbe] Now the valley of Siddim was full of holes of sticky earth; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were put to flight and came to their end there, but the rest got away to the mountain. 14:11 [hgb] 四 王 就 把 所 多 玛 和 蛾 摩 拉 所 有 的 财 物 ， 并 一 切 的 粮 食 都 掳 掠 去 了 。 [kjv] And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. [bbe] And the four kings took all the goods and food from Sodom and Gomorrah and went on their way. 14:12 [hgb] 又 把 亚 伯 兰 的 侄 儿 罗 得 和 罗 得 的 财 物 掳 掠 去 了 。 当 时 罗 得 正 住 在 所 多 玛 。 [kjv] And they took Lot, Abram\u0027s brother\u0027s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. [bbe] And in addition they took Lot, Abram\u0027s brother\u0027s son, who was living in Sodom, and all his goods. 14:13 [hgb] 有 一 个 逃 出 来 的 人 告 诉 希 伯 来 人 亚 伯 兰 。 亚 伯 兰 正 住 在 亚 摩 利 人 幔 利 的 橡 树 那 里 。 幔 利 和 以 实 各 并 亚 乃 都 是 弟 兄 ， 曾 与 亚 伯 兰 联 盟 。 [kjv] And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. [bbe] And one who had got away from the fight came and gave word of it to Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the holy tree of Mamre, the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol and Aner, who were friends of Abram. 14:14 [hgb] 亚 伯 兰 听 见 他 侄 儿 （ 原 文 作 弟 兄 ） 被 掳 去 ， 就 率 领 他 家 里 生 养 的 精 练 壮 丁 三 百 一 十 八 人 ， 直 追 到 但 ， [kjv] And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. [bbe] And Abram, hearing that his brother\u0027s son had been made a prisoner, took a band of his trained men, three hundred and eighteen of them, sons of his house, and went after them as far as Dan. 14:15 [hgb] 便 在 夜 间 ， 自 己 同 仆 人 分 队 杀 败 敌 人 ， 又 追 到 大 马 色 左 边 的 何 把 ， [kjv] And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. [bbe] And separating his forces by night, he overcame them, putting them to flight and going after them as far as Hobah, which is on the north side of Damascus. 14:16 [hgb] 将 被 掳 掠 的 一 切 财 物 夺 回 来 ， 连 他 侄 儿 罗 得 和 他 的 财 物 ， 以 及 妇 女 ， 人 民 也 都 夺 回 来 。 [kjv] And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. [bbe] And he got back all the goods, and Lot, his brother\u0027s son, with his goods and the women and the people. 14:17 [hgb] 亚 伯 兰 杀 败 基 大 老 玛 和 与 他 同 盟 的 王 回 来 的 时 候 ， 所 多 玛 王 出 来 ， 在 沙 微 谷 迎 接 他 。 沙 微 谷 就 是 王 谷 。 [kjv] And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king\u0027s dale. [bbe] And when he was coming back after putting to flight Chedorlaomer and the other kings, he had a meeting with the king of Sodom in the valley of Shaveh, that is, the King\u0027s Valley. 14:18 [hgb] 又 有 撒 冷 王 麦 基 洗 德 带 着 饼 和 酒 出 来 迎 接 。 他 是 至 高 神 的 祭 司 。 [kjv] And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. [bbe] And Melchizedek, king of Salem, the priest of the Most High God, took bread and wine, 14:19 [hgb] 他 为 亚 伯 兰 祝 福 ， 说 ， 愿 天 地 的 主 ， 至 高 的 神 赐 福 与 亚 伯 兰 。 [kjv] And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: [bbe] And blessing him, said, May the blessing of the Most High God, maker of heaven and earth, be on Abram: 14:20 [hgb] 至 高 的 神 把 敌 人 交 在 你 手 里 ， 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 亚 伯 兰 就 把 所 得 的 拿 出 十 分 之 一 来 ， 给 麦 基 洗 德 。 [kjv] And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all. [bbe] And let the Most High God be praised, who has given into your hands those who were against you. Then Abram gave him a tenth of all the goods he had taken. 14:21 [hgb] 所 多 玛 王 对 亚 伯 兰 说 ， 你 把 人 口 给 我 ， 财 物 你 自 己 拿 去 吧 。 [kjv] And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. [bbe] And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the prisoners and take the goods for yourself. 14:22 [hgb] 亚 伯 兰 对 所 多 玛 王 说 ， 我 已 经 向 天 地 的 主 至 高 的 神 耶 和 华 起 誓 。 [kjv] And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, [bbe] But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have taken an oath to the Lord, the Most High God, maker of heaven and earth, 14:23 [hgb] 凡 是 你 的 东 西 ， 就 是 一 根 线 ， 一 根 鞋 带 ， 我 都 不 拿 ， 免 得 你 说 ， 我 使 亚 伯 兰 富 足 。 [kjv] That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: [bbe] That I will not take so much as a thread or the cord of a shoe of yours; so that you may not say, I have given wealth to Abram: 14:24 [hgb] 只 有 仆 人 所 吃 的 ， 并 与 我 同 行 的 亚 乃 ， 以 实 各 ， 幔 利 所 应 得 的 分 ， 可 以 任 凭 他 们 拿 去 。 [kjv] Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion. [bbe] Give me nothing but the food which the fighting-men who went with me have had; but let Aner and Eshcol and Mamre have their part of the goods.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/363.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
