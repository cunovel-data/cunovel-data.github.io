Noah was an upright man and without sin in his generation: he went in the ways of God. \\n\\n 6:10 [hgb] 挪 亚 生 了 三 个 儿 子 ， 就 是 闪 ， 含 ， 雅 弗 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. \\n\\n [bbe] And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. \\n\\n 6:11 [hgb] 世 界 在 神 面 前 败 坏 ， 地 上 满 了 强 暴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. \\n\\n [bbe] And the earth was evil in God\u0027s eyes and full of violent ways. \\n\\n 6:12 [hgb] 神 观 看 世 界 ， 见 是 败 坏 了 。 凡 有 血 气 的 人 ， 在 地 上 都 败 坏 了 行 为 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. \\n\\n [bbe] And God, looking on the earth, saw that it was evil: for the way of all flesh had become evil on the earth. \\n\\n 6:13 [hgb] 神 就 对 挪 亚 说 ， 凡 有 血 气 的 人 ， 他 的 尽 头 已 经 来 到 我 面 前 。 因 为 地 上 满 了 他 们 的 强 暴 ， 我 要 把 他 们 和 地 一 并 毁 灭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. \\n\\n [bbe] And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come; the earth is full of their violent doings, and now I will put an end to them with the earth. \\n\\n 6:14 [hgb] 你 要 用 歌 斐 木 造 一 只 方 舟 ， 分 一 间 一 间 地 造 ， 里 外 抹 上 松 香 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. \\n\\n [bbe] Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood with rooms in it, and make it safe from the water inside and out. \\n\\n 6:15 [hgb] 方 舟 的 造 法 乃 是 这 样 ， 要 长 三 百 肘 ， 宽 五 十 肘 ， 高 三 十 肘 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. \\n\\n [bbe] And this is the way you are to make it: it is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. \\n\\n 6:16 [hgb] 方 舟 上 边 要 留 透 光 处 ， 高 一 肘 。 方 舟 的 门 要 开 在 旁 边 。 方 舟 要 分 上 ， 中 ， 下 三 层 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. \\n\\n [bbe] You are to put a window in the ark, a cubit from the roof, and a door in the side of it, and you are to make it with a lower and second and third floors. \\n\\n 6:17 [hgb] 看 哪 ！ 我 要 使 洪 水 泛 滥 在 地 上 ， 毁 灭 天 下 。 凡 地 上 有 血 肉 ， 有 气 息 的 活 物 ， 无 一 不 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die. \\n\\n [bbe] For truly, I will send a great flow of waters over the earth, for the destruction from under the heaven of all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything on the earth will come to an end. \\n\\n 6:18 [hgb] 我 却 要 与 你 立 约 ， 你 同 你 的 妻 ， 与 儿 子 ， 儿 妇 ， 都 要 进 入 方 舟 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons\u0027 wives with thee. \\n\\n [bbe] But with you I will make an agreement; and you will come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons\u0027 wives with you. \\n\\n 6:19 [hgb] 凡 有 血 肉 的 活 物 ， 每 样 两 个 ， 一 公 一 母 ， 你 要 带 进 方 舟 ， 好 在 你 那 里 保 全 生 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. \\n\\n [bbe] And you will take with you into the ark two of every sort of living thing, and keep them safe with you; they will be male and female. \\n\\n 6:20 [hgb] 飞 鸟 各 从 其 类 ， 牲 畜 各 从 其 类 ， 地 上 的 昆 虫 各 从 其 类 。 每 样 两 个 ， 要 到 你 那 里 ， 好 保 全 生 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. \\n\\n [bbe] Two of every sort of bird and cattle and of every sort of living thing which goes on the earth will you take with you to keep them from destruction. \\n\\n 6:21 [hgb] 你 要 拿 各 样 食 物 积 蓄 起 来 ， 好 作 你 和 它 们 的 食 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. \\n\\n [bbe] And make a store of every sort of food for yourself and them. \\n\\n 6:22 [hgb] 挪 亚 就 这 样 行 。 凡 神 所 吩 咐 的 ， 他 都 照 样 行 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. \\n\\n [bbe] And all these things Noah did; as God said, so he did. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/355.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
