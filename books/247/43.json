And we had to give him answers; how were we to have any idea that he would say, Come back with your brother? \\n\\n 43:8 [hgb] 犹 大 又 对 他 父 亲 以 色 列 说 ， 你 打 发 童 子 与 我 同 去 ， 我 们 就 起 身 下 去 ， 好 叫 我 们 和 你 ， 并 我 们 的 妇 人 孩 子 ， 都 得 存 活 ， 不 至 于 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the boy with me, and let us be up and going, so that we and you and our little ones may not come to destruction. \\n\\n 43:9 [hgb] 我 为 他 作 保 。 你 可 以 从 我 手 中 追 讨 ， 我 若 不 带 他 回 来 交 在 你 面 前 ， 我 情 愿 永 远 担 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: \\n\\n [bbe] Put him into my care and make me responsible for him: if I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever. \\n\\n 43:10 [hgb] 我 们 若 没 有 耽 搁 ， 如 今 第 二 次 都 回 来 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time. \\n\\n [bbe] Truly, if we had not let the time go by, we might have come back again by now. \\n\\n 43:11 [hgb] 他 们 的 父 亲 以 色 列 说 ， 若 必 须 如 此 ， 你 们 就 当 这 样 行 ， 可 以 将 这 地 土 产 中 最 好 的 乳 香 ， 蜂 蜜 ， 香 料 ， 没 药 ， 榧 子 ， 杏 仁 都 取 一 点 ， 收 在 器 具 里 ， 带 下 去 送 给 那 人 作 礼 物 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: \\n\\n [bbe] Then their father Israel said to them, If it has to be so, then do this: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels to give the man, perfumes and honey and spices and nuts: \\n\\n 43:12 [hgb] 又 要 手 里 加 倍 地 带 银 子 ， 并 将 归 还 在 你 们 口 袋 内 的 银 子 仍 带 在 手 里 。 那 或 者 是 错 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: \\n\\n [bbe] And take twice as much money with you; that is to say, take back the money which was put in your bags, for it may have been an error; \\n\\n 43:13 [hgb] 也 带 着 你 们 的 兄 弟 ， 起 身 去 见 那 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: \\n\\n [bbe] And take your brother and go back to the man: \\n\\n 43:14 [hgb] 但 愿 全 能 的 神 使 你 们 在 那 人 面 前 蒙 怜 悯 ， 释 放 你 们 的 那 弟 兄 和 便 雅 悯 回 来 。 我 若 丧 了 儿 子 ， 就 丧 了 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. \\n\\n [bbe] And may God, the Ruler of all, give you mercy before the man, so that he may give you back your other brother and Benjamin. If my children are to be taken from me; there is no help for it. \\n\\n 43:15 [hgb] 于 是 ， 他 们 拿 着 那 礼 物 ， 又 手 里 加 倍 地 带 银 子 ， 并 且 带 着 便 雅 悯 ， 起 身 下 到 埃 及 ， 站 在 约 瑟 面 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. \\n\\n [bbe] So they took what their father said for the man, and twice as much money in their hands, and Benjamin, and went on their journey to Egypt, and came before Joseph. \\n\\n 43:16 [hgb] 约 瑟 见 便 雅 悯 和 他 们 同 来 ， 就 对 家 宰 说 ， 将 这 些 人 领 到 屋 里 。 要 宰 杀 牲 畜 ， 预 备 筵 席 ， 因 为 晌 午 这 些 人 同 我 吃 饭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Joseph saw Benjamin, he said to his chief servant, Take these men into my house, and make ready a meal, for they will take food with me in the middle of the day. \\n\\n 43:17 [hgb] 家 宰 就 遵 着 约 瑟 的 命 去 行 ， 领 他 们 进 约 瑟 的 屋 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph\u0027s house. \\n\\n [bbe] And the servant did as Joseph said, and took the men into Joseph\u0027s house. \\n\\n 43:18 [hgb] 他 们 因 为 被 领 到 约 瑟 的 屋 里 ， 就 害 怕 ， 说 ， 领 我 们 到 这 里 来 ， 必 是 因 为 头 次 归 还 在 我 们 口 袋 里 的 银 子 ， 找 我 们 的 错 缝 ， 下 手 害 我 们 ， 强 取 我 们 为 奴 仆 ， 抢 夺 我 们 的 驴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph\u0027s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the men were full of fear because they had been taken into Joseph\u0027s house and they said, It is because of the money which was put back in our bags the first time; he is looking for something against us, so that he may come down on us and take us and our asses for his use. \\n\\n 43:19 [hgb] 他 们 就 挨 进 约 瑟 的 家 宰 ， 在 屋 门 口 和 他 说 话 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And they came near to the steward of Joseph\u0027s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, \\n\\n [bbe] So they went up to Joseph\u0027s chief servant at the door of the house, \\n\\n 43:20 [hgb] 说 ， 我 主 阿 ， 我 们 头 次 下 来 实 在 是 要 籴 粮 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: \\n\\n [bbe] And said, O my lord, we only came down the first time to get food; \\n\\n 43:21 [hgb] 后 来 到 了 住 宿 的 地 方 ， 我 们 打 开 口 袋 ， 不 料 ， 各 人 的 银 子 ， 分 量 足 数 ， 仍 在 各 人 的 口 袋 内 ， 现 在 我 们 手 里 又 带 回 来 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man\u0027s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. \\n\\n [bbe] And when we came to our night\u0027s resting-place, on opening our bags we saw that every man\u0027s money was in the mouth of his bag, all our money in full weight: and we have it with us to give it back; \\n\\n 43:22 [hgb] 另 外 又 带 下 银 子 来 籴 粮 。 不 知 道 先 前 谁 把 银 子 放 在 我 们 的 口 袋 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. \\n\\n [bbe] As well as more money, with which to get food: we have no idea who put our money in our bags. \\n\\n 43:23 [hgb] 家 宰 说 ， 你 们 可 以 放 心 ， 不 要 害 怕 ， 是 你 们 的 神 和 你 们 父 亲 的 神 赐 给 你 们 财 宝 在 你 们 的 口 袋 里 。 你 们 的 银 子 ， 我 早 已 收 了 。 他 就 把 西 缅 带 出 来 ， 交 给 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the servant said, Peace be with you: have no fear: your God, even the God of your father, has put wealth in your bags for you: I had your money. Then he let Simeon come out to them. \\n\\n 43:24 [hgb] 家 宰 就 领 他 们 进 约 瑟 的 屋 里 ， 给 他 们 水 洗 脚 ， 又 给 他 们 草 料 喂 驴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the man brought the men into Joseph\u0027s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. \\n\\n [bbe] And the servant took them into Joseph\u0027s house, and gave them water for washing their feet; and he gave their asses food. \\n\\n 43:25 [hgb] 他 们 就 预 备 那 礼 物 ， 等 候 约 瑟 晌 午 来 ， 因 为 他 们 听 见 要 在 那 里 吃 饭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. \\n\\n [bbe] And they got ready the things for Joseph before he came in the middle of the day: for word was given to them that they were to have a meal there. \\n\\n 43:26 [hgb] 约 瑟 来 到 家 里 ， 他 们 就 把 手 中 的 礼 物 拿 进 屋 去 给 他 ， 又 俯 伏 在 地 ， 向 他 下 拜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Joseph came in, they gave him the things which they had for him, and went down to the earth before him. \\n\\n 43:27 [hgb] 约 瑟 问 他 们 好 ， 又 问 ， 你 们 的 父 亲 就 是 你 们 所 说 的 那 老 人 家 平 安 吗 ？ 他 还 在 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, How are you? is your father well, the old man of whom you were talking to me? is he still living? \\n\\n 43:28 [hgb] 他 们 回 答 说 ， 你 仆 人 我 们 的 父 亲 平 安 。 他 还 在 。 于 是 他 们 低 头 下 拜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. \\n\\n [bbe] And they said, Your servant, our father, is well, he is still living. And they went down on their faces before him. \\n\\n 43:29 [hgb] 约 瑟 举 目 看 见 他 同 母 的 兄 弟 便 雅 悯 ， 就 说 ， 你 们 向 我 所 说 那 顶 小 的 兄 弟 就 是 这 位 吗 ？ 又 说 ， 小 儿 阿 ， 愿 神 赐 恩 给 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother\u0027s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. \\n\\n [bbe] Then, lifting up his eyes, he saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother\u0027s son, and he said, Is this your youngest brother of whom you gave me word? And he said, God be good to you, my son. \\n\\n 43:30 [hgb] 约 瑟 爱 弟 之 情 发 动 ， 就 急 忙 寻 找 可 哭 之 地 ， 进 入 自 己 的 屋 里 ， 哭 了 一 场 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Joseph\u0027s heart went out to his brother, and he went quickly into his room, for he was overcome with weeping. \\n\\n 43:31 [hgb] 他 洗 了 脸 出 来 ， 勉 强 隐 忍 ， 吩 咐 人 摆 饭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. \\n\\n [bbe] Then, after washing his face, he came out, and controlling his feelings said, Put food before us. \\n\\n 43:32 [hgb] 他 们 就 为 约 瑟 单 摆 了 一 席 ， 为 那 些 人 又 摆 了 一 席 ， 也 为 和 约 瑟 同 吃 饭 的 埃 及 人 另 摆 了 一 席 ， 因 为 埃 及 人 不 可 和 希 伯 来 人 一 同 吃 饭 。 那 原 是 埃 及 人 所 厌 恶 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. \\n\\n [bbe] And they put a meal ready for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who were with him by themselves; because the Egyptians may not take food with the Hebrews, for that would make them unclean. \\n\\n 43:33 [hgb] 约 瑟 使 众 弟 兄 在 他 面 前 排 列 坐 席 ， 都 按 着 长 幼 的 次 序 ， 众 弟 兄 就 彼 此 诧 异 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. \\n\\n [bbe] And they were all given their seats before him in order of birth, from the oldest to the youngest: so that they were looking at one another in wonder. \\n\\n 43:34 [hgb] 约 瑟 把 他 面 前 的 食 物 分 出 来 ， 送 给 他 们 。 但 便 雅 悯 所 得 的 比 别 人 多 五 倍 。 他 们 就 饮 酒 ， 和 约 瑟 一 同 宴 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin\u0027s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him. \\n\\n [bbe] And Joseph sent food to them from his table, but he sent five times as much to Benjamin as to any of the others. And they took wine freely with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/392.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
