separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left. \\n\\n [bbe] Is not all the land before you? then let us go our separate ways: if you go to the left, I will go to the right; or if you take the right, I will go to the left. \\n\\n 13:10 [hgb] 罗 得 举 目 看 见 约 旦 河 的 全 平 原 ， 直 到 琐 珥 ， 都 是 滋 润 的 ， 那 地 在 耶 和 华 未 灭 所 多 玛 ， 蛾 摩 拉 以 先 如 同 耶 和 华 的 园 子 ， 也 像 埃 及 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. \\n\\n [bbe] And Lot, lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of Jordan, saw that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord had sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah; it was like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, on the way to Zoar. \\n\\n 13:11 [hgb] 于 是 罗 得 选 择 约 旦 河 的 全 平 原 ， 往 东 迁 移 。 他 们 就 彼 此 分 离 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. \\n\\n [bbe] So Lot took for himself all the valley of Jordan, and went to the east, and they were parted from one another. \\n\\n 13:12 [hgb] 亚 伯 兰 住 在 迦 南 地 ， 罗 得 住 在 平 原 的 城 邑 ， 渐 渐 挪 移 帐 棚 ， 直 到 所 多 玛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom. \\n\\n [bbe] Abram went on living in the land of Canaan, and Lot went to the lowland towns, moving his tent as far as Sodom. \\n\\n 13:13 [hgb] 所 多 玛 人 在 耶 和 华 面 前 罪 大 恶 极 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the men of Sodom were evil, and great sinners before the Lord. \\n\\n 13:14 [hgb] 罗 得 离 别 亚 伯 兰 以 后 ， 耶 和 华 对 亚 伯 兰 说 ， 从 你 所 在 的 地 方 ， 你 举 目 向 东 西 南 北 观 看 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord had said to Abram, after Lot was parted from him, From this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west: \\n\\n 13:15 [hgb] 凡 你 所 看 见 的 一 切 地 ， 我 都 要 赐 给 你 和 你 的 后 裔 ， 直 到 永 远 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. \\n\\n [bbe] For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your seed for ever. \\n\\n 13:16 [hgb] 我 也 要 使 你 的 后 裔 如 同 地 上 的 尘 沙 那 样 多 ， 人 若 能 数 算 地 上 的 尘 沙 才 能 数 算 你 的 后 裔 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. \\n\\n [bbe] And I will make your children like the dust of the earth, so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered, then will your children be numbered. \\n\\n 13:17 [hgb] 你 起 来 ， 纵 横 走 遍 这 地 ， 因 为 我 必 把 这 地 赐 给 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee. \\n\\n [bbe] Come, go through all the land from one end to the other for I will give it to you. \\n\\n 13:18 [hgb] 亚 伯 兰 就 搬 了 帐 棚 ， 来 到 希 伯 仑 幔 利 的 橡 树 那 里 居 住 ， 在 那 里 为 耶 和 华 筑 了 一 座 坛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abram, moving his tent, came and made his living-place by the holy tree of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and made an altar there to the Lord. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/362.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
