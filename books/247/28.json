[bbe] Then Isaac sent for Jacob, and blessing him, said, Do not take a wife from among the women of Canaan; 28:2 [hgb] 你 起 身 往 巴 旦 亚 兰 去 ， 到 你 外 祖 彼 土 利 家 里 ， 在 你 母 舅 拉 班 的 女 儿 中 娶 一 女 为 妻 。 [kjv] Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother\u0027s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother\u0027s brother. [bbe] But go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother\u0027s father, and there get yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban, your mother\u0027s brother. 28:3 [hgb] 愿 全 能 的 神 赐 福 给 你 ， 使 你 生 养 众 多 ， 成 为 多 族 ， [kjv] And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; [bbe] And may God, the Ruler of all, give you his blessing, giving you fruit and increase, so that you may become an army of peoples. 28:4 [hgb] 将 应 许 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 福 赐 给 你 和 你 的 后 裔 ， 使 你 承 受 你 所 寄 居 的 地 为 业 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 地 。 [kjv] And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. [bbe] And may God give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed, so that the land of your wanderings, which God gave to Abraham, may be your heritage. 28:5 [hgb] 以 撒 打 发 雅 各 走 了 ， 他 就 往 巴 旦 亚 兰 去 ， 到 亚 兰 人 彼 土 利 的 儿 子 拉 班 那 里 。 拉 班 是 雅 各 ， 以 扫 的 母 舅 。 [kjv] And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob\u0027s and Esau\u0027s mother. [bbe] So Isaac sent Jacob away: and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramaean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. 28:6 [hgb] 以 扫 见 以 撒 已 经 给 雅 各 祝 福 ， 而 且 打 发 他 往 巴 旦 亚 兰 去 ， 在 那 里 娶 妻 ， 并 见 祝 福 的 时 候 嘱 咐 他 说 ， 不 要 娶 迦 南 的 女 子 为 妻 ， [kjv] When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; [bbe] So when Esau saw that Isaac had given Jacob his blessing, and sent him away to Paddan-aram to get a wife for himself there, blessing him and saying to him, Do not take a wife from among the women of Canaan; 28:7 [hgb] 又 见 雅 各 听 从 父 母 的 话 往 巴 旦 亚 兰 去 了 ， [kjv] And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram; [bbe] And that Jacob had done as his father and mother said and had gone to Paddan-aram; 28:8 [hgb] 以 扫 就 晓 得 他 父 亲 以 撒 看 不 中 迦 南 的 女 子 ， [kjv] And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; [bbe] It was clear to Esau that his father had no love for the women of Canaan, 28:9 [hgb] 便 往 以 实 玛 利 那 里 去 ， 在 他 二 妻 之 外 又 娶 了 玛 哈 拉 为 妻 。 他 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 的 女 儿 ， 尼 拜 约 的 妹 子 。 [kjv] Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham\u0027s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. [bbe] So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Abraham\u0027s son Ishmael, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had. 28:10 [hgb] 雅 各 出 了 别 是 巴 ， 向 哈 兰 走 去 。 [kjv] And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. [bbe] So Jacob went out from Beer-sheba to go to Haran. 28:11 [hgb] 到 了 一 个 地 方 ， 因 为 太 阳 落 了 ， 就 在 那 里 住 宿 ， 便 拾 起 那 地 方 的 一 块 石 头 枕 在 头 下 ， 在 那 里 躺 卧 睡 了 ， [kjv] And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. [bbe] And coming to a certain place, he made it his resting-place for the night, for the sun had gone down; and he took one of the stones which were there, and putting it under his head he went to sleep in that place. 28:12 [hgb] 梦 见 一 个 梯 子 立 在 地 上 ， 梯 子 的 头 顶 着 天 ， 有 神 的 使 者 在 梯 子 上 ， 上 去 下 来 。 [kjv] And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. [bbe] And he had a dream, and in his dream he saw steps stretching from earth to heaven, and the angels of God were going up and down on them. 28:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 站 在 梯 子 以 上 （ 或 作 站 在 他 旁 边 ） ， 说 ， 我 是 耶 和 华 你 祖 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 神 ， 也 是 以 撒 的 神 。 我 要 将 你 现 在 所 躺 卧 之 地 赐 给 你 和 你 的 后 裔 。 [kjv] And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; [bbe] And he saw the Lord by his side, saying, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac: I will give to you and to your seed this land on which you are sleeping. 28:14 [hgb] 你 的 后 裔 必 像 地 上 的 尘 沙 那 样 多 ， 必 向 东 西 南 北 开 展 。 地 上 万 族 必 因 你 和 你 的 后 裔 得 福 。 [kjv] And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. [bbe] Your seed will be like the dust of the earth, covering all the land to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south: you and your seed will be a name of blessing to all the families of the earth. 28:15 [hgb] 我 也 与 你 同 在 。 你 无 论 往 哪 里 去 ， 我 必 保 佑 你 ， 领 你 归 回 这 地 ， 总 不 离 弃 你 ， 直 到 我 成 全 了 向 你 所 应 许 的 。 [kjv] And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. [bbe] And truly, I will be with you, and will keep you wherever you go, guiding you back again to this land; and I will not give you up till I have done what I have said to you. 28:16 [hgb] 雅 各 睡 醒 了 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 真 在 这 里 ， 我 竟 不 知 道 。 [kjv] And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not. [bbe] And Jacob, awaking from his sleep, said, Truly, the Lord is in this place and I was not conscious of it. 28:17 [hgb] 就 惧 怕 ， 说 ， 这 地 方 何 等 可 畏 ， 这 不 是 别 的 ， 乃 是 神 的 殿 ， 也 是 天 的 门 。 [kjv] And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. [bbe] And fear came on him, and he said, This is a holy place; this is nothing less than the house of God and the doorway of heaven. 28:18 [hgb] 雅 各 清 早 起 来 ， 把 所 枕 的 石 头 立 作 柱 子 ， 浇 油 在 上 面 。 [kjv] And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. [bbe] And early in the morning Jacob took the stone which had been under his head, and put it up as a pillar and put oil on it. 28:19 [hgb] 他 就 给 那 地 方 起 名 叫 伯 特 利 （ 就 是 神 殿 的 意 思 ） 。 但 那 地 方 起 先 名 叫 路 斯 。 [kjv] And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first. [bbe] And he gave that place the name of Beth-el, but before that time the town was named Luz. 28:20 [hgb] 雅 各 许 愿 说 ， 神 若 与 我 同 在 ， 在 我 所 行 的 路 上 保 佑 我 ， 又 给 我 食 物 吃 ， 衣 服 穿 ， [kjv] And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, [bbe] Then Jacob took an oath, and said, If God will be with me, and keep me safe on my journey, and give me food and clothing to put on, 28:21 [hgb] 使 我 平 平 安 安 地 回 到 我 父 亲 的 家 ， 我 就 必 以 耶 和 华 为 我 的 神 。 [kjv] So that I come again to my father\u0027s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God: [bbe] So that I come again to my father\u0027s house in peace, then I will take the Lord to be my God, 28:22 [hgb] 我 所 立 为 柱 子 的 石 头 也 必 作 神 的 殿 ， 凡 你 所 赐 给 我 的 ， 我 必 将 十 分 之 一 献 给 你 。 [kjv] And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God\u0027s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee. [bbe] And this stone which I have put up for a pillar will be God\u0027s house: and of all you give me, I will give a tenth part to you.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/377.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
