And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. \\n\\n [bbe] And the earth was waste and without form; and it was dark on the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God was moving on the face of the waters. \\n\\n 1:3 [hgb] 神 说 ， 要 有 光 ， 就 有 了 光 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. \\n\\n [bbe] And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. \\n\\n 1:4 [hgb] 神 看 光 是 好 的 ， 就 把 光 暗 分 开 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. \\n\\n [bbe] And God, looking on the light, saw that it was good: and God made a division between the light and the dark, \\n\\n 1:5 [hgb] 神 称 光 为 昼 ， 称 暗 为 夜 。 有 晚 上 ， 有 早 晨 ， 这 是 头 一 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. \\n\\n [bbe] Naming the light, Day, and the dark, Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. \\n\\n 1:6 [hgb] 神 说 ， 诸 水 之 间 要 有 空 气 ， 将 水 分 为 上 下 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. \\n\\n [bbe] And God said, Let there be a solid arch stretching over the waters, parting the waters from the waters. \\n\\n 1:7 [hgb] 神 就 造 出 空 气 ， 将 空 气 以 下 的 水 ， 空 气 以 上 的 水 分 开 了 。 事 就 这 样 成 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. \\n\\n [bbe] And God made the arch for a division between the waters which were under the arch and those which were over it: and it was so. \\n\\n 1:8 [hgb] 神 称 空 气 为 天 。 有 晚 上 ， 有 早 晨 ， 是 第 二 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. \\n\\n [bbe] And God gave the arch the name of Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day. \\n\\n 1:9 [hgb] 神 说 ， 天 下 的 水 要 聚 在 一 处 ， 使 旱 地 露 出 来 。 事 就 这 样 成 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. \\n\\n [bbe] And God said, Let the waters under the heaven come together in one place, and let the dry land be seen: and it was so. \\n\\n 1:10 [hgb] 神 称 旱 地 为 地 ， 称 水 的 聚 处 为 海 。 神 看 着 是 好 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. \\n\\n [bbe] And God gave the dry land the name of Earth; and the waters together in their place were named Seas: and God saw that it was good. \\n\\n 1:11 [hgb] 神 说 ， 地 要 发 生 青 草 ， 和 结 种 子 的 菜 蔬 ， 并 结 果 子 的 树 木 ， 各 从 其 类 ， 果 子 都 包 着 核 。 事 就 这 样 成 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. \\n\\n [bbe] And God said, Let grass come up on the earth, and plants producing seed, and fruit-trees giving fruit, in which is their seed, after their sort: and it was so. \\n\\n 1:12 [hgb] 于 是 地 发 生 了 青 草 ， 和 结 种 子 的 菜 蔬 ， 各 从 其 类 ， 并 结 果 子 的 树 木 ， 各 从 其 类 ， 果 子 都 包 着 核 。 神 看 着 是 好 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. \\n\\n [bbe] And grass came up on the earth, and every plant producing seed of its sort, and every tree producing fruit, in which is its seed, of its sort: and God saw that it was good. \\n\\n 1:13 [hgb] 有 晚 上 ， 有 早 晨 ， 是 第 三 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the evening and the morning were the third day. \\n\\n [bbe] And there was evening and there was morning, the third day. \\n\\n 1:14 [hgb] 神 说 ， 天 上 要 有 光 体 ， 可 以 分 昼 夜 ， 作 记 号 ， 定 节 令 ， 日 子 ， 年 岁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: \\n\\n [bbe] And God said, Let there be lights in the arch of heaven, for a division between the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for marking the changes of the year, and for days and for years: \\n\\n 1:15 [hgb] 并 要 发 光 在 天 空 ， 普 照 在 地 上 。 事 就 这 样 成 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. \\n\\n [bbe] And let them be for lights in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth: and it was so. \\n\\n 1:16 [hgb] 于 是 神 造 了 两 个 大 光 ， 大 的 管 昼 ， 小 的 管 夜 。 又 造 众 星 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. \\n\\n [bbe] And God made the two great lights: the greater light to be the ruler of the day, and the smaller light to be the ruler of the night: and he made the stars. \\n\\n 1:17 [hgb] 就 把 这 些 光 摆 列 在 天 空 ， 普 照 在 地 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, \\n\\n [bbe] And God put them in the arch of heaven, to give light on the earth; \\n\\n 1:18 [hgb] 管 理 昼 夜 ， 分 别 明 暗 。 神 看 着 是 好 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. \\n\\n [bbe] To have rule over the day and the night, and for a division between the light and the dark: and God saw that it was good. \\n\\n 1:19 [hgb] 有 晚 上 ， 有 早 晨 ， 是 第 四 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. \\n\\n [bbe] And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day. \\n\\n 1:20 [hgb] 神 说 ， 水 要 多 多 滋 生 有 生 命 的 物 ， 要 有 雀 鸟 飞 在 地 面 以 上 ， 天 空 之 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. \\n\\n [bbe] And God said, Let the waters be full of living things, and let birds be in flight over the earth under the arch of heaven. \\n\\n 1:21 [hgb] 神 就 造 出 大 鱼 和 水 中 所 滋 生 各 样 有 生 命 的 动 物 ， 各 从 其 类 。 又 造 出 各 样 飞 鸟 ， 各 从 其 类 。 神 看 着 是 好 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. \\n\\n [bbe] And God made great sea-beasts, and every sort of living and moving thing with which the waters were full, and every sort of winged bird: and God saw that it was good. \\n\\n 1:22 [hgb] 神 就 赐 福 给 这 一 切 ， 说 ， 滋 生 繁 多 ， 充 满 海 中 的 水 。 雀 鸟 也 要 多 生 在 地 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. \\n\\n [bbe] And God gave them his blessing, saying, Be fertile and have increase, making all the waters of the seas full, and let the birds be increased in the earth. \\n\\n 1:23 [hgb] 有 晚 上 ， 有 早 晨 ， 是 第 五 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. \\n\\n [bbe] And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day. \\n\\n 1:24 [hgb] 神 说 ， 地 要 生 出 活 物 来 ， 各 从 其 类 。 牲 畜 ， 昆 虫 ， 野 兽 ， 各 从 其 类 。 事 就 这 样 成 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. \\n\\n [bbe] And God said, Let the earth give birth to all sorts of living things, cattle and all things moving on the earth, and beasts of the earth after their sort: and it was so. \\n\\n 1:25 [hgb] 于 是 神 造 出 野 兽 ， 各 从 其 类 。 牲 畜 ， 各 从 其 类 。 地 上 一 切 昆 虫 ， 各 从 其 类 。 神 看 着 是 好 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. \\n\\n [bbe] And God made the beast of the earth after its sort, and the cattle after their sort, and everything moving on the face of the earth after its sort: and God saw that it was good. \\n\\n 1:26 [hgb] 神 说 ， 我 们 要 照 着 我 们 的 形 像 ， 按 着 我 们 的 样 式 造 人 ， 使 他 们 管 理 海 里 的 鱼 ， 空 中 的 鸟 ， 地 上 的 牲 畜 ， 和 全 地 ， 并 地 上 所 爬 的 一 切 昆 虫 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. \\n\\n [bbe] And God said, Let us make man in our image, like us: and let him have rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every living thing which goes flat on the earth. \\n\\n 1:27 [hgb] 神 就 照 着 自 己 的 形 像 造 人 ， 乃 是 照 着 他 的 形 像 造 男 造 女 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. \\n\\n [bbe] And God made man in his image, in the image of God he made him: male and female he made them. \\n\\n 1:28 [hgb] 神 就 赐 福 给 他 们 ， 又 对 他 们 说 ， 要 生 养 众 多 ， 遍 满 地 面 ， 治 理 这 地 。 也 要 管 理 海 里 的 鱼 ， 空 中 的 鸟 ， 和 地 上 各 样 行 动 的 活 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. \\n\\n [bbe] And God gave them his blessing and said to them, Be fertile and have increase, and make the earth full and be masters of it; be rulers over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing moving on the earth. \\n\\n 1:29 [hgb] 神 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 将 遍 地 上 一 切 结 种 子 的 菜 蔬 和 一 切 树 上 所 结 有 核 的 果 子 ， 全 赐 给 你 们 作 食 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. \\n\\n [bbe] And God said, See, I have given you every plant producing seed, on the face of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit producing seed: they will be for your food: \\n\\n 1:30 [hgb] 至 于 地 上 的 走 兽 和 空 中 的 飞 鸟 ， 并 各 样 爬 在 地 上 有 生 命 的 物 ， 我 将 青 草 赐 给 它 们 作 食 物 。 事 就 这 样 成 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. \\n\\n [bbe] And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the air and every living thing moving on the face of the earth I have given every green plant for food: and it was so. \\n\\n 1:31 [hgb] 神 看 着 一 切 所 造 的 都 甚 好 。 有 晚 上 ， 有 早 晨 ， 是 第 六 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. \\n\\n [bbe] And God saw everything which he had made and it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/324.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
