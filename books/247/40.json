And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. \\n\\n [bbe] Then they said to him, We have had a dream, and no one is able to give us the sense. And Joseph said, Does not the sense of dreams come from God? what was your dream? \\n\\n 40:9 [hgb] 酒 政 便 将 他 的 梦 告 诉 约 瑟 说 ， 我 梦 见 在 我 面 前 有 一 棵 葡 萄 树 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; \\n\\n [bbe] Then the chief wine-servant gave Joseph an account of his dream, and said, In my dream I saw a vine before me; \\n\\n 40:10 [hgb] 树 上 有 三 根 枝 子 ， 好 像 发 了 芽 ， 开 了 花 ， 上 头 的 葡 萄 都 成 熟 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: \\n\\n [bbe] And on the vine were three branches; and it seemed as if it put out buds and flowers, and from them came grapes ready for cutting. \\n\\n 40:11 [hgb] 法 老 的 杯 在 我 手 中 ， 我 就 拿 葡 萄 挤 在 法 老 的 杯 里 ， 将 杯 递 在 他 手 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Pharaoh\u0027s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh\u0027s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh\u0027s hand. \\n\\n [bbe] And Pharaoh\u0027s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and crushing them into Pharaoh\u0027s cup, gave the cup into Pharaoh\u0027s hand. \\n\\n 40:12 [hgb] 约 瑟 对 他 说 ， 他 所 作 的 梦 是 这 样 解 ， 三 根 枝 子 就 是 三 天 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days: \\n\\n [bbe] Then Joseph said, This is the sense of your dream: the three branches are three days; \\n\\n 40:13 [hgb] 三 天 之 内 ， 法 老 必 提 你 出 监 ， 叫 你 官 复 原 职 ， 你 仍 要 递 杯 在 法 老 的 手 中 ， 和 先 前 作 他 的 酒 政 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh\u0027s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. \\n\\n [bbe] After three days Pharaoh will give you honour, and put you back into your place, and you will give him his cup as you did before, when you were his wine-servant. \\n\\n 40:14 [hgb] 但 你 得 好 处 的 时 候 ， 求 你 记 念 我 ， 施 恩 与 我 ， 在 法 老 面 前 提 说 我 ， 救 我 出 这 监 牢 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: \\n\\n [bbe] But keep me in mind when things go well for you, and be good to me and say a good word for me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison: \\n\\n 40:15 [hgb] 我 实 在 是 从 希 伯 来 人 之 地 被 拐 来 的 。 我 在 这 里 也 没 有 作 过 什 么 ， 叫 他 们 把 我 下 在 监 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. \\n\\n [bbe] For truly I was taken by force from the land of the Hebrews; and I have done nothing for which I might be put in prison. \\n\\n 40:16 [hgb] 膳 长 见 梦 解 得 好 ， 就 对 约 瑟 说 ， 我 在 梦 中 见 我 头 上 顶 着 三 筐 白 饼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head: \\n\\n [bbe] Now when the chief bread-maker saw that the first dream had a good sense, he said to Joseph, I had a dream; and in my dream there were three baskets of white bread on my head; \\n\\n 40:17 [hgb] 极 上 的 筐 子 里 有 为 法 老 烤 的 各 样 食 物 ， 有 飞 鸟 来 吃 我 头 上 筐 子 里 的 食 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. \\n\\n [bbe] And in the top basket were all sorts of cooked meats for Pharaoh; and the birds were taking them out of the baskets on my head. \\n\\n 40:18 [hgb] 约 瑟 说 ， 你 的 梦 是 这 样 解 ， 三 个 筐 子 就 是 三 天 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: \\n\\n [bbe] Then Joseph said, This is the sense of your dream: the three baskets are three days; \\n\\n 40:19 [hgb] 三 天 之 内 ， 法 老 必 斩 断 你 的 头 ， 把 你 挂 在 木 头 上 ， 必 有 飞 鸟 来 吃 你 身 上 的 肉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. \\n\\n [bbe] After three days Pharaoh will take you out of prison, hanging you on a tree, so that your flesh will be food for birds. \\n\\n 40:20 [hgb] 到 了 第 三 天 ， 是 法 老 的 生 日 ， 他 为 众 臣 仆 设 摆 筵 席 ， 把 酒 政 和 膳 长 提 出 监 来 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh\u0027s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the third day was Pharaoh\u0027s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his servants; and he gave honour to the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker among the others. \\n\\n 40:21 [hgb] 使 酒 政 官 复 原 职 ， 他 仍 旧 递 杯 在 法 老 手 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh\u0027s hand: \\n\\n [bbe] And he put the chief wine-servant back in his old place; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh\u0027s hand. \\n\\n 40:22 [hgb] 但 把 膳 长 挂 起 来 ， 正 如 约 瑟 向 他 们 所 解 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. \\n\\n [bbe] But the chief bread-maker was put to death by hanging, as Joseph had said. \\n\\n 40:23 [hgb] 酒 政 却 不 记 念 约 瑟 ， 竟 忘 了 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. \\n\\n [bbe] But the wine-servant did not keep Joseph in mind or give a thought to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/389.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
