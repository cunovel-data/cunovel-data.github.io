And the fourth river is Euphrates. \\n\\n [bbe] And the name of the third river is Tigris, which goes to the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. \\n\\n 2:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 将 那 人 安 置 在 伊 甸 园 ， 使 他 修 理 看 守 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to do work in it and take care of it. \\n\\n 2:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 吩 咐 他 说 ， 园 中 各 样 树 上 的 果 子 ， 你 可 以 随 意 吃 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord God gave the man orders, saying, You may freely take of the fruit of every tree of the garden: \\n\\n 2:17 [hgb] 只 是 分 别 善 恶 树 上 的 果 子 ， 你 不 可 吃 ， 因 为 你 吃 的 日 子 必 定 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. \\n\\n [bbe] But of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not take; for on the day when you take of it, death will certainly come to you. \\n\\n 2:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 说 ， 那 人 独 居 不 好 ， 我 要 为 他 造 一 个 配 偶 帮 助 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord God said, It is not good for the man to be by himself: I will make one like himself as a help to him \\n\\n 2:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 用 土 所 造 成 的 野 地 各 样 走 兽 和 空 中 各 样 飞 鸟 都 带 到 那 人 面 前 ， 看 他 叫 什 么 。 那 人 怎 样 叫 各 样 的 活 物 ， 那 就 是 它 的 名 字 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. \\n\\n [bbe] And from the earth the Lord God made every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and took them to the man to see what names he would give them: and whatever name he gave to any living thing, that was its name. \\n\\n 2:20 [hgb] 那 人 便 给 一 切 牲 畜 和 空 中 飞 鸟 ， 野 地 走 兽 都 起 了 名 。 只 是 那 人 没 有 遇 见 配 偶 帮 助 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. \\n\\n [bbe] And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every beast of the field; but Adam had no one like himself as a help. \\n\\n 2:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 使 他 沉 睡 ， 他 就 睡 了 。 于 是 取 下 他 的 一 条 肋 骨 ， 又 把 肉 合 起 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord God sent a deep sleep on the man, and took one of the bones from his side while he was sleeping, joining up the flesh again in its place: \\n\\n 2:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 就 用 那 人 身 上 所 取 的 肋 骨 ， 造 成 一 个 女 人 ， 领 她 到 那 人 跟 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. \\n\\n [bbe] And the bone which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman, and took her to the man. \\n\\n 2:23 [hgb] 那 人 说 ， 这 是 我 骨 中 的 骨 ， 肉 中 的 肉 ， 可 以 称 她 为 女 人 ， 因 为 她 是 从 男 人 身 上 取 出 来 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. \\n\\n [bbe] And the man said, This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh: let her name be Woman because she was taken out of Man. \\n\\n 2:24 [hgb] 因 此 ， 人 要 离 开 父 母 与 妻 子 连 合 ， 二 人 成 为 一 体 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. \\n\\n [bbe] For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh. \\n\\n 2:25 [hgb] 当 时 夫 妻 二 人 赤 身 露 体 ， 并 不 羞 耻 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. \\n\\n [bbe] And the man and his wife were without clothing, and they had no sense of shame. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/6/316.html","bookId":247,"book":{"id":247,"title":"Genesis创世纪(双语小说)","description":"简介： In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
