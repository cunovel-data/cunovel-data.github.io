There had been no way I was letting her go get in dark water all alone but this I could do. However, after several minutes and Della not coming back out I decided I needed to go check on things. She’d had more than enough time to go pee.\\n\\n When my foot hit the top step I heard Angelina’s familiar high-pitched voice. Shit. Her car wasn’t out here. What was she doing in my house?\\n\\n I jerked the door open and stalked into my living room. Della stood there with her arms crossed protectively over her chest as she stood against the wall while Angelina continued to badger her with questions.\\n\\n “What the fuck are you doing in my house?” I roared as I shoved past Angelina and grabbed Della so I could protect her. It was a miracle Angelina hadn’t sent Della into one of her panic attacks. I ran my hand down her back to soothe her as I glared at Angelina who was watching me closely.\\n\\n “This is why? You threw away your future because of her? She works as a server at the club, Woods. What the hell are you thinking? Look at her. She’s… she’s… just all out there. Nothing about her fits you. Are you fucking her as a form of rebellion?”\\n\\n Della flinched in my arms and I was real close to not caring that Angelina was a woman. I was ready to hurt her.\\n\\n “Be very careful what you say. This is my house you broke into. I’ll have your ass locked up until your daddy can get here and bail you out.”\\n\\n Della was stiff in my arms and I slid my finger under her chin and tilted her face up so I could see her eyes. She was with me. Good.\\n\\n I looked back up at Angelina. “You need to leave. Don’t ever step foot back in this house. And stay away from Della. You talk to her or hurt her and you’ll regret it.”\\n\\n Angelina hissed and slung her hair over her shoulder. “You don’t threaten me Woods Kerrington. I’m not scared of you. This… this farce you have going on here with her,” she pointed her long manicured nail toward Della, “it’s ridiculous. I would have still married you. All you had to do was tell me you needed to get this one out of your system.”\\n\\n Della flinched in my arms again and I’d had enough.\\n\\n “Get. Out. Now,” I roared.\\n\\n “Well, I need to call someone to get me. I had my daddy drop me off here. I thought I could wait on you and talk to you. But she came walking in instead of you.”\\n\\n “You have a phone. Leave my house and call someone to come get you. I want you out of here.”\\n\\n Angelina spun around and her heels clacked against my hard wood floors. When the door slammed behind her I picked Della up and carried her into my room and sat down with her on the bed.\\n\\n “Look at me,” I said, needing to see her face.\\n\\n She lifted her eyes to me and the confusion and pain I’d expected to see wasn’t there. Instead she was… angry.\\n\\n “You were going to marry that bitch? Really? What were your parents thinking? She’s horrible, Woods. You’re so much better than that. I can’t...”\\n\\n I covered her mouth with mine before she could say anything else. I was so damn relieved to hear the anger in her voice instead of hurt I just needed to reassure myself she was okay.\\n\\n Della kissed me back with equal vigor then pushed me away.\\n\\n “I still have got to pee,” she said and stood up.\\n\\n I smiled as she ran to the bathroom.\\n\\n Then the fact my father was going to know about Della hit me and any humor that had been there was gone. He’d hate this. He’d hate her. If there was any way I could shut Angelina up I would. I just didn’t know how. She was a woman scorned. She’d been tossed for someone else and she was furious.\\n\\n I reached for my iPhone and turned it off. If he called tonight I wasn’t dealing with him. I would make sure Della was nowhere near when I had this conversation with him. If he pushed me too far I’d pack up and leave. Della had a list of places she wanted to see and we’d make sure to go see them all.\\n\\n The bathroom door opened and Della walked out in a yellow bikini that barely contained her tits. Just like the one she’d had on that day at the beach causing every man around to drool. I watched her as she walked toward me.\\n\\n “Do you know what today is?” she asked. My eyes were on her chest. Her tits bounced as she walked.\\n\\n “Saturday,” I replied.\\n\\n She reached up and untied the bikini strap and let it fall to the ground leaving her breasts bare. Didn’t look like we were going back to the bonfire.\\n\\n “It’s been seven days since I took the first pill,” she said as she slipped her thumbs into the sides of her bikini bottoms and slowly slid them down her legs and stepped out of them.\\n\\n It had been seven days. How the hell did I forget that? I jerked my shirt over my head and stood up and grabbed her then threw her on the bed.\\n\\n “Here I was worried you were going to be upset because of my crazy ex and you come walking out of the bathroom giving me a strip tease. Fuck, woman, you’re every damn fantasy I’ve ever had.”\\n\\n She threw her hands over her head and grabbed the headboard with both her hands.\\n\\n “I want you to come inside me. Over and over again,” she said opening her legs and arching her back playfully.\\n\\n I pulled my board shorts off and climbed on top of her. “The first time it is gonna be fast because I can’t wait. I need to do this. We’ll go slow and easy the next time, I swear.”\\n\\n She licked her lips slowly. “Then fuck me hard.”\\n\\n I was gonna explode before I even got inside her if she kept this naughty little temptress act up.\\n\\n I lifted her hips and slammed into her in one hard move.\\n\\n “YES! Oh God, yes,” she cried out and I let any concern about taking care of her go. She wanted the bad boy and I was real ready to unleash him. The idea of coming inside her was making my balls tighten just from the thought. I wouldn’t be able to stop tonight. I was going to fuck her all over this house.\\n\\n I slid out and back in over and over again as she writhed beneath me. She was begging and crying my name. Her nails clawed at my back and I knew her marks would be there tomorrow. It made me even more insane. I wanted her marks all over me. Just as thoroughly as I was about to mark her pussy.\\n\\n Della lifted her knees and squeezed my hips with her legs. “I’m gonna come,” she panted. “Oh god. Now, I’m,ahhhh,” she cried out and her nails dug into my back as she held onto me.\\n\\n I let her squeeze me until I exploded inside her. My body shook as I drove into her one last time as my seed flooded her walls. I wanted to shout in triumph knowing this was mine. Nothing my family wanted or demanded could make me walk away from this. From her. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-perfection-perfection-1/page-32.html","bookId":1991,"book":{"id":1991,"title":"Twisted Perfection (Perfection #1)","description":"Storyline: Twisted Perfection (Perfection #1) \\n Life outside of her house was a new experience for Della Sloane.
