{"id":74113,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Woods I kept the little red car in my rearview mirror. I was having Della follow me just out of town to a Mexican restaurant that had really good food. And there was a better chance I wouldn’t run into anyone I knew. Tonight was about taking a break from the stress that my life had become. My dad was pushing me more and more to prove myself. I wasn’t sure what the hell else he wanted from me. No, that wasn’t true. I knew his plans for me. He expected me to get married. Not to someone of my choosing though. He had already chosen who he wanted me to marry- Angelina Greystone. All my life, Dad had planned on having a Kerrington name linked with the Greystone name. He’d had his eye on the prize. Every year we’d spend a week in Hawaii with the Greystones and Dad always encouraged me to get to know Angelina. For us to spend time together. Hell, they’d pushed us together so much at such a young age that we’d ended up having sex at fifteen. I’d thought I was her first until I’d actually slept with a virgin and I realized Angelina had been lying. I might have been a virgin that year but she sure hadn’t been. It had jaded my view of the pretty blonde. The older and more glamorous she became the more I ran like hell to stay away from her. She had claws and she wanted them deep in me. I knew the day would come when I’d cave just to make my dad happy but I was putting it off as long as I could. Or I had been until Angelina had moved south. She was now taking up residence in her parents’ beach house and my dad was forcing her on me constantly. I needed to step back from all the shit that came with being a Kerrington and hopefully enjoy this hot little number who had the body of a sex goddess and the face of an angel. She seemed skittish at first but then some wild carefree girl emerged and I wasn’t one to turn away sexy invitations. That body and those big blue eyes had been all the hinting I needed. Better yet, this one wasn’t sticking around. I’d get a naughty distraction who wouldn’t come with the high maintenance syndrome later. She’d just drive away. The memory of that ass of hers stuck up in the air in those tiny shorts that barely covered it up had me shifting in my seat to adjust my excitement. Della Sloane was just what I needed tonight. I pulled into the gravel parking lot of El Mexicano and parked on the far side of the building so that someone driving by wouldn’t notice my truck. No interruptions tonight. I was getting laid. The hot no strings attached kind of laid. I stepped out of the truck and watched as Della got out of her car. She wasn’t wearing a bra under that black halter-top. Those tits of hers held the fabric up like one big tease. Damn, this was gonna be a good night. I was more than positive she wanted this too. She’d all but pressed her ass against my dick after I’d opened her gas tank. This one knew what she was doing and she did it well. “Good choice. I love Mexican,” she said, smiling at me. I watched her hips sway invitingly as she walked my way. I was about ready to forgo the meal and just head straight to the hotel room. Her dark hair fell just below her shoulders in soft natural curls. I was also more than positive those long dark eyelashes were the courtesy of good genes and not out of a package. I’d seen my share of false eyelashes on females and these looked real. “I’m glad,” I replied, stepping forward and placing my hand on the small of her back to lead her inside. Once the food was ordered Della took a sip of her margarita and smiled at me. “So, Woods, what do you do for a living?” I wasn’t answering that truthfully. I didn’t like to give women too much info into my life unless I planned on keeping one around. “I work in management.” Della didn’t frown or look perturbed that I’d blown off her question. She kept smiling and sipping the sweet yellow drink. “Obviously you aren’t ready for the hard questions. I’m good with that. How about you tell me what you love to do.” “Golf, when I get time, and taking really hot females out to eat Mexican food,” I replied with a smirk. Della threw her head back and laughed. She was so free of inhibitions. She wasn’t trying to impress me. It was refreshing. Her eyes twinkled when she looked back at me. “What’s your biggest fear?” Whoa. Weird turn of questioning. “I don’t think I have any fears,” I replied. “Sure you do. Everyone does,” she said before licking at the salt around her glass. Did she have fears? It sure didn’t look like it. “Becoming my dad,” I said before I could stop myself. That was too much for her to know. More than I admitted to anyone. A far away expression came over her face as she stared over my shoulder. “That’s odd. My fear is that I’ll become my mom.” Her big blue eyes blinked rapidly and a smile came back on her face. Where ever she’d gone mentally she was back. Thinking about her mom wasn’t something she wanted to do and I understood that. “What do you love to do?” I asked her wanting to change the subject back to something light. “Dance in the rain, meet new people, laugh, watch old eighties movies, and I like to sing,” she replied then smiled at me before taking another sip. At this rate she was going to get hammered if I didn’t watch her closely. Two margaritas later and she was pressing her chest against my arms while laughing at all my jokes. I was cutting her off now because she was just the right kind of tipsy. I didn’t want her completely drunk. “You ready to go find that hotel room of yours and let me get the bed nice and warm for you?” I asked, grinning down at her and slipping my hand between her legs. She froze at first then slowly eased them open so that I could move my hand up high enough to feel the dampness against her panties. She wanted me just as much as I wanted her. That was confirmation enough. I ran the tip of my finger up the wet crotch of her panties and she trembled against me. She moved against my hand and closed her eyes while her mouth fell slightly open with a blissful look. Damn, she was responsive. “Is this what you want?” I whispered in her ear as I slipped a finger inside her panties and felt the hot moist temptation with no barrier. “Yes,” she breathed. “But only if you promise you’ll make me come.” Fuck. I snatched my hand out of her panties and grabbed my wallet. I slapped a hundred dollar bill on the table. We didn’t have time to wait on a ticket. I wanted exactly what she was promising. As for making her come, I’d make sure she passed out from the number of orgasms I intended to give her. Never throw a Kerrington a challenge like that one. We would go above and beyond. She wasn’t going to be able to drive her car like this. I’d figure out how to get it back to her later. I didn’t have time to think about that right now. I opened my truck door and put her inside with more force than I’d intended. Her big blue eyes went round with surprise and I stopped to catch my breath and think this through. Maybe I shouldn’t do this. Was that nervous flash in her eyes really innocence? Her body was telling me one thing but those eyes were saying something else. She pulled her bottom lip into her mouth and bit down. I wanted to taste that mouth. I didn’t walk around to my side. I’d get to that later. I crawled up in the truck and closed the door behind me before grabbing each side of her head and tilting it just right. My mouth covered hers and I let her taste slowly sink into me. Each small moan from her lips pounded through my veins. The fullness of her bottom lip as it moved against my mouth with inexperienced hunger was driving me mad. I forced myself to pull back and look down at her hooded eyes. “Are you sure you want this? Because if you’re not, we need to stop now.” We’d never see each other again. I needed to know she wasn’t the innocent that I kept sensing in her touch. I wasn’t against one-night stands if the girl knew what she was in for. I needed her to be clear on this. “I,” she said then paused and swallowed hard. That wasn’t the answer I was looking for. I started to move back away from her but she reached out and grabbed my shirt. “No, wait. I want this. I need it. Please, don’t stop.” I still wasn’t sure. She didn’t sound positive. “Is this your first one-night-stand?” I asked thinking that may be the reason behind the way she was acting. She shook her head no and a small sad smile touched her lips. “No. The last one I had was bad. Really bad. I want you to make me forget it. I want to know what it feels like to just do it for pleasure. Nothing else. Just make me feel good.” She wasn’t a virgin. That was good. A bad one-nighter would make anyone unsure about doing it again. I could make her forget it. “I’ll make it feel real good, sweetheart,” I assured her. Then I reached down and took the bottom of her little excuse for a shirt and pulled it over her head. She wasn’t wearing a bra. I’d known that but seeing her bared to me was still breathtaking. “Oh,” she squealed and fell back on her elbows which only pushed her breasts out further toward me. I was a tit man. There was no doubt about it and I was pretty damn sure I’d died and gone to heaven. “These babies are fucking incredible,” I swore before lowering my mouth to pull one of her round, candy red nipples into my mouth. “Oh yes,” she cried. I smiled to myself. Normally I didn’t like the vocal ones but this one wasn’t practiced. She was real. Every cry out of her mouth sounded like she meant it. I filled my hands with both of her breasts and spent equal time teasing and sucking. I was pretty damn sure I could do this all night and not get bored. “AH! Please I need you inside me. I wanna come,” Della begged. I wanted her to come too but if she didn’t stop making those naughty demands I was going to come first in my damn jeans. I reached for the waist of her shorts and jerked them and her panties down at the same time. I threw them to the floor before spreading open her legs with both my hands. She was waxed. Fuck yes. The sexy scent of her arousal met my nose and I growled in appreciation. I needed to taste this. I wanted that orgasm she was begging for to happen in my mouth first. I touched the smooth skin and ran a finger down the center. Della bucked wildly against the leather seat. “I’m gonna kiss this,” I warned before pressing my lips to the swollen clit sticking out in need of attention. “Ohmygod,” she moaned and both her hands grabbed the back of my head. I couldn’t keep from smiling. I licked gently at first and then began tasting with more earnest. She really was delicious. I’d tasted many women but this one was sweet. I pressed the tip of my nose against her clit as I slid my tongue inside her. Both her hands fisted in my hair as she cried out my name. I loved hearing her say it. Probably more than I should for a one-night stand I’d never see again. The reminder that I wouldn’t see her again made me a little frantic. I needed more. I began licking her with more intensity. Until that first orgasm erupted on my tongue and she screamed my name over and over. It was the first time I’d ever come close to losing it in my jeans since high school. I pressed one more kiss to her tender flesh before sitting back and unbuttoning my jeans. I should wait until I got her to a hotel room but I needed to get the edge off first. If I was only getting one night with this girl then I was going to enjoy her over and over again. This first fuck would get me stable enough so that I could drive to the nearest hotel I could find. I jerked open my glove compartment and pulled out one of the condoms I kept in there. I tore the wrapper off and slid it down over my dick before looking at her. She was watching me closely. Her pink tongue came out and wet her lips. I groaned and pulled one of her legs up over my shoulder so I could move in between her legs comfortably. “What if someone sees us?” she asked, still breathless from her very vocal reaction to her orgasm. I laughed. She was just now thinking about that. “These windows are tinted, it’s dark, and there is no light around us, we’re also pretty damn high up in this thing. No one’s going to see us.” She gave me a sexy smile and let her hands fall back over her head causing those tits to jiggle. This wasn’t gonna last long. I was too damn close. I pressed the head of my cock to her opening and slowly began pressing in. She was tight. Too fucking tight. God, no, please don’t let her be a virgin. Girls that looked like her were not virgins at her age. She was meant to be fucked. “You’re tight,” I bit out. She nodded and moaned opening her legs wider. “I’m not a virgin,” she reminded me. Right. Why was it I kept wanting to slow down and ease her into this? She was hot and ready. The worry that she was innocent was screwing with my head. I slammed into her and we both cried out. She was incredibly fucking tight but she hadn’t been lying; there was no barrier. She wasn’t a virgin; she just had a pussy from heaven. Damn, this was incredible. I slid back out of her and she reached up and grabbed the handle on the door bracing herself for me to pound back into her. “Hard... please... again,” she panted. I didn’t have to be told twice. I managed to hit it even harder this time and those tits of hers bounced beautifully. I was pretty sure I’d never get over them. I was gonna come. This was too much. I slipped my hand down between us and ran my finger over her clit several times until she was panting and pleading. “You like that? Such a naughty girl. Asking me to fuck you harder,” I whispered against her ear as I used the wetness pouring out of her to lubricate her swollen clit. “Ohgod, Woods. Ohgod, I’m gonna come again,” she cried and I pulled her nipple into my mouth and sucked while playing with her clit. She exploded beneath my touch and I grabbed the back of the seat and the dashboard for support as I slammed into her only two times before I followed her into release. Della I slowly peeled my eyes open and stared up at the ceiling. The hotel room was silent. I was alone. I was also relieved. I wasn’t sure how I could face Woods after last night. I was a lot of things but whore wasn’t one of them. Thinking back to last night’s events I felt very much like a whore. I wasn’t sure what had possessed me… unless it was the tequila. Maybe my courage to take what I wanted had come from a little too much to drink but I hadn’t been drunk. I’d known exactly what I was doing. Woods was hot, dripping with charisma, and did I mention hot? And I didn’t even know his last name. I covered my face with both my hands and started to laugh. I’d had wild monkey sex with a man I’d just met. How crazy was that? At least he’d used a condom each time we’d done it: in the truck, in the shower, against the table, and then finally in the bed. After which I’d promptly passed out. I’d wanted to know what good sex was. Now, I knew what earth shattering sex was. Mission accomplished. One thing was for sure. I’d never forget Woods. This was a trip to experience life and with Woods I had managed to experience one of the finer things in life. Stretching, I stood up and glanced around the room for my clothes. Wait… my car. I needed my car. My luggage was in my... Uh, my luggage was sitting at the foot of the bed. What? I had left it in my car. I pulled the sheet from the bed and wrapped it around me. Then I walked over to the window and pushed back the curtain. It didn’t take me but a minute to find Braden’s red car parked out front. Woods had gone and gotten it for me and brought my luggage inside. My heart warmed at his thoughtfulness. If I was going to have sex with a random stranger at least I’d chosen one who didn’t leave a girl completely stranded.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-perfection-perfection-1/page-2.html","bookId":1991,"book":{"id":1991,"title":"Twisted Perfection (Perfection #1)","description":"Storyline: Twisted Perfection (Perfection #1) Life outside of her house was a new experience for Della Sloane.
