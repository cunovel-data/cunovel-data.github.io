Be mysterious.”\\n\\n She nodded vigorously. “No talking, no laughing.”\\n\\n “I will reward you well for this, love,” he said gently. “Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.”\\n\\n “You know I would do anything for you. You gave me a home and a family. I owe you my life.”\\n\\n With a careless toss of his hand, Christopher waved away her gratitude and his discomfiture with it. He never knew what to say when people thanked him, so he preferred they not do it. “You have been of great help to me. There is nothing to repay me for.”\\n\\n Angelica smiled and danced closer, lifting his hand to kiss the back. “So is this dress the one?”\\n\\n He nodded. “Yes. You look stunning.”\\n\\n Her smile widened, then she retreated to the dressing room.\\n\\n “I would not have the courage to attempt this deception,” Philip said from his seat by the fire.\\n\\n “It would not be wise to antagonize Sedgewick now,” Christopher explained, lighting a cheroot off a nearby taper. “Until I know what my next move will be, it’s best to leave him with his il usions of power. It will set him at ease, perhaps make him complacent, freeing me to work on a permanent solution without his interference.”\\n\\n “I have seen only renderings of Lady Winter, but from the tales I have heard she sounds quite unique. It is hard to imitate the incomparable.”\\n\\n Christopher nodded, his gaze resting briefly on the reflection of light in Philip’s spectacles. The young man had cut his brown hair short that morning, unfashionable as the style was. It made him look younger than his ten and eight years.\\n\\n “Very hard, but Maria is too il to attend, there is no skirting around that fact. The risk to her health outweighs my need at the moment. If Sedgewick were to detect the ruse, I could explain it in some fashion. There is no denying that Maria and I are…” Christopher exhaled, releasing a puff of fragrant smoke. “Whatever in hel we are, she would acknowledge me if I asked.”\\n\\n “I hope you are correct in assuming that no one will notice the differences between the two women.”\\n\\n “It is much easier to disclaim a fraud when one compares the original to the fake. In this case, Maria has been out of Town for a fortnight. The guests will have to rely upon their memory of her, as she will be home in bed. Angelica and I will make certain we are seen by Sedgewick posthaste and then we will depart quickly.”\\n\\n Philip lifted his brandy-fil ed glass. “May your plan succeed flawlessly.”\\n\\n Christopher grinned. “They usual y do.”\\n\\n Chapter 9\\n\\n A s they waited in the line of carriages approaching the Campion manse, Maria breathed in and out with a measured rhythm. Every bump in the road brought her such pain she felt nauseous. The constriction of her corset did not help matters and the weight of her elaborate hair arrangement made her neck ache.\\n\\n Simon sat across from her, his garments far more casual, his gaze glittering in the semidarkness created by the turned-down carriage lamps.\\n\\n “I will be waiting for you,” he murmured.\\n\\n “Thank you.”\\n\\n “Despite the circumstances, you look ravishing.”\\n\\n She managed a wan smile. “Thankful y, Welton and I never speak for long. I anticipate a half hour, though the actual assignation may take up a bit more time than that.”\\n\\n “I will send a footman after you if an hour passes. You will be call ed away. Say it is St. John who seeks your company.”\\n\\n “Lovely.”\\n\\n The carriage rattled over the cobblestones of the circular drive and then stopped again. This time the door was pulled open and her footman extended his hand to assist her down. He was careful, but not obviously so. Maria rewarded his concern with a soft smile, then she took the steps and entered the manse.\\n\\n The subsequent wait in the receiving line was torture, as was managing to sound gay when speaking to the beaming Campions. It was with great relief that she was freed from the formalities, and with a quick adjustment of her feathered half-mask, she entered the crowded bal room.\\n\\n Her lovely gown of pale pink with its silver ribbons and lace was hidden beneath her black domino. Nothing she owned was capable of hiding her injury, leaving her no other recourse. Because of her lack of options, Maria wore her garments with aplomb, but kept a discreet profile. She moved careful y around the perimeter of the room, weaving between guests, sending out a silent signal to stay away that, thankful y, was effective.\\n\\n Her gaze drifted from one side of the vast space to the other, searching for Welton. Overhead, three massive chandeliers were ablaze with countless candles, lighting up the ornate ceiling with its elaborate moldings and colorful murals. The orchestra played and guests spun about on the dance floor in a profusion of lace, impressively styled coiffures, and floral fabrics. Numerous conversations coalesced into a single hum of sound, the noise somewhat soothing because it meant that no one was paying attention to her.\\n\\n Maria was beginning to think she might survive the excursion when she was bumped by a careless guest. Pain lanced down her left side and she gasped, her body turning away in self-defense.\\n\\n “Forgive me,” a low voice said behind her.\\n\\n Spinning to face the offending person, she found herself standing before a man whose eyes widened as if he knew her.\\n\\n “Sedgewick!” a portly man call ed out. Maria knew him to be Lord Pearson, a man who spoke and imbibed far too much. Since she had no wish to speak to him or to be delayed by an introduction to the graceless Sedgewick, she hurried away.\\n\\n It was then that she saw him, her faithless paramour, his golden hair glinting beneath the candlelight, his powerful form resplendent in cream silk accented by beautiful embroidery. Despite the mask that hid his features, she knew it was Christopher. He was leaning over a dark-haired woman attentively, his pose betraying his affection.\\n\\n His promise of exclusive use was a lie.\\n\\n The throbbing in her shoulder faded as a different feeling of hurt took over.\\n\\n “Ah, there you are.” Welton’s voice behind her made her stiffen. “Must I send the modiste to you again?” he asked as she turned to face him. “Have you nothing more fetching to wear?”\\n\\n “What do you want?”\\n\\n “And why are you so bloody pale?”\\n\\n “New powder. You do not find it attractive?” She batted her lashes at him. “I think it shows my patches and rouge to better advantage.”\\n\\n He snorted. “No, I do not like it. Throw it out. You look sickly.”\\n\\n “You wound me.”\\n\\n Welton’s glare spoke volumes. “Your worth in this world is based entirely upon your appearance. I would not be so quick to devalue it.”\\n\\n His insult affected her not at all . “What do you want?” she repeated.\\n\\n “To make an introduction.” His smile made her skin crawl. “Come along.” He col ected her right hand and led her away.\\n\\n After a few moments of silence while traversing through the crush, Maria found the courage to ask, “How is Amelia?”\\n\\n The examining glance he threw over his shoulder revealed a great deal. He did not discount her as a possible instigator of the recent attack.\\n\\n “Wonderful.”\\n\\n She hadn’t truly expected that he would rule her involvement out. Stil , her spirits plummeted as she realized how he would respond. Security would be tighter, his movements more wary. Her work to find her sister would be harder.\\n\\n “Ah,” Welton murmured, his tone smug. “There he is.” He jerked his chin toward the man who stood a few feet away. Maria knew to whom he referred despite the crowd because of the intensity of the stare directed at her from the eyes of the mask. The man leaned insolently against the wal , his long legs crossed at the ankle, his pose seductively arrogant.\\n\\n “The Earl of Eddington,” she breathed. A libertine of the first water. Handsome, wealthy, titled, and reputed to be quite accomplished in every activity he set his mind to—including bedsport.\\n\\n Coming to an abrupt halt, Maria released Welton’s arm and turned to face him with a scowl. “What the devil do you want with him?”\\n\\n “He asked for an introduction.”\\n\\n “You know very well what he wants.”\\n\\n Welton’s smile widened. “And he would pay handsomely for it. If you decide to indulge, it would line your purse nicely.”\\n\\n “Have you fall en into debt so soon?” she snapped.\\n\\n “No, no. But my expenditures are about to increase, which means your all otted share of Winter’s settlement is about to decrease. I thought you would appreciate my assistance in shoring up your finances.”\\n\\n Stepping closer, she lowered her voice, a gambit that did nothing to hide her revulsion. “I appreciate nothing about you.”\\n\\n “Of course you wouldn’t, ungrateful child,” he said smoothly. He lifted his hands in mock defensiveness, but nothing could add warmth to those vacuous eyes. “I am facilitating an introduction, not a tryst.”\\n\\n She glanced at Eddington and he bowed slightly, his mouth curved in a smile that had brought ruin to many women. Besides making her teeth grit together, it did nothing for her. “You pulled me away from St. John for this?”\\n\\n “I saw St. John,” he dismissed. “He is besotted. A night without you will only increase his enchantment.”\\n\\n Snorting, Maria applauded St. John’s ability to deceive. Of course, Welton preferred to see things in the most beneficial light, which was not always the way things actually were.\\n\\n “Do not glare at me,” he admonished. “It is not attractive.” He sighed as if dealing with an unreasonable child. “It is the hint of your unavailability and insatiability that makes you so sought after. Why do you think I all ow you to keep that Irish lover of yours? If he did not increase your appeal I would have rid you of him long ago.”\\n\\n It took her a moment to rein in the fury that gripped her at his carelessly tossed threat to Simon. Final y, she was able to say, “Shal we move along with this, then? I’ve no wish to be here all night.”\\n\\n “You truly must learn to enjoy yourself more,” Welton murmured, reclaiming her hand. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/passion-for-the-game-georgian-2/page-18.html","bookId":2659,"book":{"id":2659,"title":"Passion for the Game (Georgian #2)","description":"Storyline: Passion for the Game (Georgian #2) \\n Match Point \\n Infamous for satisfying his limitless wants and desires, Christopher is a free man again.
