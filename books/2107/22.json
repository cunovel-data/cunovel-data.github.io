{"id":91494,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"The shock brought Druzil abruptly from his sleepy state. The bottle had been closed! The chaos curse, which Druzil had waited decades to witness, had been defeated! The imp still could recognize the misty magic in the air, but already it was beginning to diminish.\n Druzil reached out with his thoughts toward Barjin but found telepathic communication to the priest blocked by a wall of rage. He didn\u0027t really want to go into the altar room; he had seen the formidable dwarves tear apart Barjin\u0027s zombie and feared another dart from the young priest. When Druzil glanced around at the empty corridors, he realized that he had no other way to go. He reached down to the small pouch hanging on the base of one wing and pulled it free, clutching it in his taloned hands.\n He crept up to the door. Beyond Mullivy\u0027s chopped up remains lay the two unconscious dwarves, and farther in, by the altar, a young woman. Druzil\u0027s surprise at the unexpected scene lasted only as long as it took the imp to consider what had transpired. The sudden shock of the chaos curse\u0027s end, the termination of the magic that had permeated these peoples\u0027 thoughts so fully, had overcome them.\n Druzil saw Barjin advance on the young priest-and now the imp knew that this young man had been the catalyst, the one who had opened the bottle. Apparently, he also had been the one to close it.\n The great evil priest seemed not so powerful in Druzil\u0027s eyes anymore. Barjin\u0027s vestments and weapon were gone, one arm hung limply at his side, and, most important, he had allowed the bottle to be closed.\n There it rested, powerless, atop the altar. Druzil had an impulse to go and get it, to whisk it away through the fire gate back to Castle Trinity. The imp quickly dismissed that notion. Not only would he have to get within striking distance of the young man who earlier had brought him down, but if he took the bottle and Barjin somehow survived the day, the priest\u0027s continuing mission at the library would be futile. And the priest would not be happy.\n No, Druzil decided, right now the bottle was not worth the many risks. If Barjin survived, perhaps the priest would find another catalyst to rejuvenate the curse. Druzil could get back here if that came to pass.\n The imp opened the small pouch he held and looked away from the impending battle, to the brazier that, fortunately, still burned.\n Cadderly started to reach for another dart but realized that the evil priest would get to him before he could load it. Even if he did get his crossbow readied, Cadderly doubted that he could find the courage to use it against a living man.\n Barjin sensed his ambivalence. \"You should have let the dwarves kill me,\" he snickered.\n \"No!\" Cadderly replied firmly. He dropped his crossbow and slipped one finger into his pocket, into the loop of his spindle-disks.\n \"Did you really believe that I would provide information, that keeping me alive would prove beneficial?\" Barjin asked.\n Cadderly shook his head. Barjin had missed the point. Cadderly had only made that claim to convince Ivan and Pikel not to kill him. His true motives in keeping Barjin alive had nothing to do with information, but with his own desire not to kill a man he did not have to kill. \"We had no reason to kill you,\" he said evenly. \"The fight was already won.\"\n \"So you believed,\" snarled Barjin. He skipped across the remaining distance to Cadderly and whipped Ivan\u0027s axe across as viciously as his wounded hand would allow.\n Anticipating the attack, Cadderly easily dodged aside. He pulled his hand from his pocket and sent Percival spindle-disks flying out at Barjin. They connected with a thud on Barjin\u0027s chest, but the mighty priest was more startled than injured.\n He looked at Cadderly-or more pointedly, at Cadderly\u0027s coiled weapon hand-for a moment, then laughed aloud.\n Cadderly nearly threw himself at the mocking priest, but he realized that was exactly what his opponent wanted him to do. His only chance in this fight was to play defensively, the same way he had defeated Kierkan Rufo back in his room. He grinned widely against the continuing laughter and tried to appear as confident as possible.\n Barjin was not Kierkan Rufo. The evil priest had seen countless battles, had defeated seasoned warriors in single combat, and had directed armies marching across the Vaasan plains. After just a single viewing, this veteran\u0027s confident smile revealed that he had surmised the limitations of Cadderly\u0027s strange weapon, and he knew as well as Cadderly that he would have to make a huge mistake if the young priest was to have any chance.\n \"You should not have returned to this place,\" Barjin said, calmly. \"You should have left the Edificant Library altogether and given up what was already lost.\"\n Cadderly paused to consider the unexpected words, and the even more unexpected, almost resigned, tone. \"I erred,\" he replied, \"when first I came down here. I returned only to correct the wrong.\"\n He glanced over at the bottle to emphasize his point. \"And now I have done that.\"\n \"Have you?\" Barjin teased. \"Your friends are down, young fool. All those in the library are down, I would guess. When you closed the bottle, you weakened your allies more than your enemies.\"\n Cadderly could not deny the priest\u0027s taunt, but he still believed that he had done the right thing in closing the bottle. He would find a way to revive his friends, and all the others. Perhaps they were only sleeping.\n \"Do you truly believe that, once loosed, Tuanta Quiro Miancay, the Most Fatal Horror, could be defeated simply by placing the stopper back in the flask?\" Barjin smiled widely. \"Look,\" he said, pointing over at the altar. \"Even now the agent of my goddess Talona battles its way back through your pitiful barrier, back into the air it has claimed as Talona\u0027s domain.\"\n Cadderly should have seen the trick coming, but his own insecurity concerning the unknown bottle and curse caused him to glance to the side again. Still, he was not caught completely off his guard when Barjin waded straight in, growling and swinging.\n Cadderly ducked under one cut, then rolled to the side as Barjin reversed Percival swing and came with a wicked overhead chop. Cadderly tried to scramble back to his feet, but Barjin was too quick. Before he could rise, he was rolling again, back the other way, to avoid another dipping slice.\n Cadderly knew that he couldn\u0027t keep this up for long, nor could he launch any effective counters from a position on the floor. Barjin, relentless with the taste of victory on his drooling lips, kept the two-headed axe under perfect control and readied yet another strike. The issue seemed decided.\n It became an eerie, almost slow-motion sequence for Cadderly as he watched Barjin maneuvering into position. Was this the moment of his death? What then of Danica and Ivan and Pikel?\n The flap of wings sounded by the door. Cadderly, too engrossed with Percival own dilemma, hardly took note, but Barjin did glance around.\n Seeing Percival opening, Cadderly rolled away as fast as he could. Barjin easily could have caught up to him, but the priest seemed more concerned with the unexpected appearance of his missing imp.\n \"Where have you been?\" Barjin demanded. Stripped of his vestments and weapon, ragged and beaten, the priest\u0027s words did not carry much authority.\n Druzil didn\u0027t even answer. He floated across to the brazier, pausing only to scoop up Barjin\u0027s necromancer\u0027s stone.\n \"Put it back!\" Barjin roared. \"You play a dangerous game, imp.\"\n Druzil considered the stone, then the priest, then moved to the brazier. His gaze again drifted back to the closed bottle, but if he was considering a try for it, he quickly thought better of it. The enraged Barjin, if not the young priest, surely would strike him down if he went within reach.\n \"I will protect it,\" Druzil offered, holding up the stone. \"And the bottle?\"\n \"You will run and hide!\" Barjin retorted sharply. \"You think me beaten?\"\n Druzil shrugged, his wings nearly burying Percival head with the action.\n \"Stay and watch, cowardly imp,\" Barjin proclaimed. \"Watch as I regain my victory and finish off this pitiful library.\"\n Druzil hesitated for a long moment, considering the offer. \"I prefer a safer haven,\" he announced.\n \"I will return when things are under your control.\"\n \"Leave the stone!\" Barjin commanded.\n Druzil\u0027s smile revealed much to the priest. The imp clutched the powerful necromancer\u0027s stone all the tighter and dropped his powder into the burning brazier. The magical fire flashed and burned with a bluish hue, and Druzil casually stepped through the reopened gate.\n \"Coward!\" Barjin cried. \"I will win this day. I will loose Tuanta Quiro Miancay again, and you, cowardly imp, will no longer be treated as an ally!\"\n His threats were lost in the crackle of the brazier\u0027s flames.\n Barjin spun back on Cadderly, now standing around on the other side of the altar, opposite the priest. \"You can still save yourself and your friends,\" Barjin purred, suddenly friendly. \"Join me. Open the bottle once more. The power you will realize ...\"\n Cadderly saw through the He and cut the priest short, though Barjin\u0027s sudden charm was effective enough to be shocking. \"You need me to open it because you cannot, because it must be opened by one who is not allied with your god,\" he reasoned.\n Barjin\u0027s curved smile did not diminish.\n \"How can I agree, then?\" Cadderly asked him. \"To do so would be to join with you, but would that not ally me with your designs and with your god? Would that not break the conditions?\"\n Cadderly thought himself quite clever, thought that his logic had cornered the priest, as Barjin mulled the words over. When Barjin looked back at him, Percival eyes shining fiercely, Cadderly knew that he had thought wrong.\n \"Not if you open the bottle for a better reason,\" Barjin said, turning to view Danica and the dwarves, \"to save the woman perhaps.\" Barjin took a step away.\n All fear flew from Cadderly at that moment. He jumped out from behind the altar, meaning to intercept Barjin, determined to stop the priest at any cost. He stopped suddenly, eyes widening in horror.\n Another being had entered the room, one that Cadderly had seen before.\n Barjin\u0027s reaction was just the opposite of Cadderly\u0027s. He swung the axe high above his head victoriously, feeling that his base of power was returning, that his fortunes had turned back for the better. \"I had thought you destroyed,\" he said to the scorched mummy.\n Khalif, the less than complete spirit, savaged and removed from all sense of sanity, did not respond.\n \"What are you doing?\" the evil priest demanded as the mummy stalked in. Barjin swiped with the axe, hoping to keep the monster at bay, but the mummy simply slapped the weapon from his hand.\n \"Halt!\" Barjin cried. \"You must obey me!\"\n Khalif had other ideas. Before Barjin could say anything else, a heavy arm slammed into the side of Percival head and sent him tumbling to the wall by the brazier.\n Barjin knew his doom. The mummy was out of control, crazed with pain and rage. It hated all life, hated Barjin for bringing it back from its rest. With all that had happened, both to Barjin and to the mummy, the priest\u0027s domination was no more.\n Barjin looked desperately to the table where he had left the necromancer\u0027s stone, the one item that might aid him now against this undead foe. Then he remembered, and he cursed Druzil\u0027s abrupt departure.\n He propped himself up against the wall and looked about desperately. To his right loomed the burning brazier, the gate reopened but not an escape route for a being of the material plane. To Barjin\u0027s left, though, was Pikel\u0027s impromptu doorway, an exit to the tunnels beyond the room.\n He tried to rise, but a throbbing pain in his head dropped him back to his knees. Undaunted, Barjin began to crawl. Before he could get to the hole, though, the mummy cut him off and slammed him again into the wall. Barjin had no defense against the ensuing onslaught. He raised his one functioning arm, but the mummy\u0027s heavy blows snapped it aside.\n Cadderly stood very still beside the altar, consciously telling himself to take some action. The fear gripped him, but he at last overcame it by conjuring an image of the mummy s next move after finishing off Barjin. Danica was the next closest target.\n He took his crossbow in hand and loaded it, seeking some way to get the monster off the priest.\n Cadderly had no love for the man, and he held no hopes that helping Barjin might bring some mutually beneficial compromise, but despite the fact that Barjin was his enemy, he could not let the human be killed by this undead monster.\n Another problem presented itself as Cadderly leveled Percival bow for a shot. The imp\u0027s passage had reopened the inter-planar gate, and now some lower plane denizen had found its way in. A hideous face appeared in the flames, obscure, but huge, and growing more tangible with each passing second.\n Cadderly instinctively lined his crossbow up with this newest intruder, but then swung it back at the mummy, realizing that it was Percival most pressing problem.\n Another scorch mark appeared on the mummy\u0027s rotted linen; another jolt shook the monster, but the scabrous thing did not turn away from Barjin. The priest managed once to stand up, only to be immediately pounded back to the floor.\n A huge black wing tip came out the side of the brazier fire. Cadderly nearly lost Percival breath; the creature forming in the flames was monstrous, much larger than the imp.\n Cadderly loaded and fired again at the mummy. Another bit, and now, with Barjin offering no resistance, the mummy wheeled about.\n Cadderly felt that paralyzing fear welling in him again, but he did not let it slow his practiced movements. He had used more than half his darts and had no idea if he had enough remaining to finally defeat this undead thing, had no idea if his attacks were even causing any real damage to the monster.\n Again, he refused to let his fears slow him. Another dart whistled out at the mummy. This one did not explode, but dove through a hole created by a previous dart and cut right through the tattered linen bindings.\n At first Cadderly was more concerned with getting another dart fitted; he knew that his miss would allow the monster to close, but then he heard Barjin grunt.\n The dart thudded into the chest of the sitting priest. The next interminable second ended with the noise that Cadderly now dreaded, for the dart had enough remaining momentum to collapse and explode.\n The mummy took a step out, giving Cadderly a view of the priest. Barjin lay nearly flat. Only his head and shoulders remained propped against the wall. He gasped and clutched the hole in his chest, his eyes unblinking, though he seemed not to see anything, not to be aware of anything beyond his own demise. He gasped again, a gout of blood bursting from his mouth, and then he lay still.\n Cadderly did not even think of his movements. His mind seemed to disengage from his body, to give way to Percival own instincts for survival and his own boiling rage at what he had done. He took up his water skin under his free arm, popped off the cap, and drove the mummy back toward the wall with a steady stream of blessed water.\n The liquid hissed as it struck the evilly enchanted linen, etching blackened scars. The mummy issued a loud, outraged roar and tried to cover up, but it had no way to block the small but painful stream.\n In the brazier, a hideous face was dear now, leering hungrily at Cadderly. Cadderly thought to defeat both foes with a single attack. He angled his water skin, seeking to drive the mummy into the flames, perhaps to topple the brazier and dose the gate.\n The mummy did indeed recoil from the spray, but if it feared the blessed water, it feared the open flames even more. Try as he might, Cadderly could not force it too near the burning gate.\n He apparently was doing some damage, but Cadderly could not afford this stalemate. He was running out of water; then what might he use to finish off the mummy? And if that monster came through the gate ... .\n Helplessly, Cadderly fumbled to keep up the stream and to load another dart. He lifted his crossbow toward the mummy, trying to find a vital area beyond its blocking arms. What area, he wondered helplessly, might be the most vulnerable? The eyes? The heart?\n The water skin was empty. The mummy stood straight.\n \"Last shot,\" Cadderly muttered resignedly. He started to pull on the trigger, then,\" as he had with Barjin earlier in the fight, he noticed another possibility.\n Pikel\u0027s charge through the wall had caused tremendous structural damage. The hole in the brickwork was fully four feet wide and half that again high, nearly reaching the beamed ceiling. One crossbeam, directly above the hole, balanced precariously on a cracked support. Cadderly moved his arm in that direction and fired.\n The dart smacked into the wood at the joint between cross-beam and support, exploding into a small fireball, sending splinters everywhere. The crossbeam slipped, but, still attached at its other end, it swung down like a pendulum.\n The mummy took only one short step from the wall before the beam slammed into it, driving it sidelong. It pitched into the brazier, taking the fiery tripod and bowl right over with it. The hideous image of the otherworldly denizen disappeared in a huge fireball. Flames engulfed the mummy, eagerly devouring its layered cloth wrappings. It managed to stagger to its feet-Cadderly wondered with horror if it might survive even this-but then it crumbled and was consumed.\n Without the enchanted brazier, the gate was dosed, and gone, too, was Barjin\u0027s greatest undead monster. The flames flared a couple of times, then burned very low, leaving the smoky room in the dimness of low-burning torches.\n Cadderly understood that victory was within his grasp, but he hardly felt in the mood for rejoicing. Newander lay dead at his feet, others had died upstairs, and, perhaps most disconcerting of all to the young scholar, no longer an innocent, he had killed a man.\n Barjin remained propped against the wall, his lifeless eyes staring out at Cadderly, holding the defenseless young priest in an accusing gaze.\n Cadderly\u0027s arm drooped to his side and the crossbow fell to the floor. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-canticle-the-cleric-quintet-1/page-22.html","bookId":2107,"book":{"id":2107,"title":"The Cleric Quintet: Canticle (The Cleric Quintet #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The evil wizard Aballister has spent two years collecting and brewing a potion of power, as told to him by the imp, Druzil, sent by the Goddess of Poison, Talona.
