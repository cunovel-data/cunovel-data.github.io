{"id":91485,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Cadderly sorted through the many leather straps hanging in his wardrobe, finally puffing out a belt with a strangely shaped, wide and shallow leather sheath on one side. The fit of the small crossbow was perfect-there was even a place for the loading pin. As usual, Ivan and Pikel had crafted the metal to exact specifications.\n Cadderly drew the crossbow out again as soon as he had put it in. He tested the pin next, cranking the bow and firing several times. The action was smooth and easy; Cadderly even managed, without too much difficulty, to manipulate the weapon enough to crank it with one hand.\n Next Cadderly took out the bandolier and slung it over his shoulder, carefully lining up the sixteen loaded darts in front of him, within easy reach. He winced when he wondered what damage a blow to Percival chest might cause, but he held faith that the darts and the bandolier had been properly constructed. He felt better when he saw himself in the mirror, as if wearing his latest inventions had returned to him some control over his surroundings. Any smile he felt welling was quickly sublimated, though, when he remembered the dangerous task ahead. This was no game, he reminded himself. Already, and because of his own actions, several men had died and all the library was threatened.\n Cadderly moved across the room, behind the door, to a closed and sealed iron box. He fitted a key into the lock, then paused for a long moment, considering carefully the precise steps he had to follow once the box was opened. He had practiced this maneuver many times, but never before had he believed he would need it.\n As soon as the box lid was opened, all the area around Cadderly fell into a globe of absolute darkness. It was not a surprise to the young scholar; Cadderly had paid Histra handsomely for placing this reversed form of her light spell within the box. It was inconvenient-and Cadderly did not enjoy dealing with Histra-but necessary to protect one of Cadderly\u0027s most prized possessions.\n In an ancient tome, Cadderly had stumbled upon the formula for the very potent sleep poison used by the drow elves. The exotic ingredients had not been found easily-one fungus in particular could only be gained in deep tunnels far below Toril\u0027s surface-and the arrangements to mix them-which the alchemist, Belago, had done deep underground also-had been even more difficult to secure, but Cadderly had persevered. With the blessings and backing of Dean Thobicus, his efforts had produced five tiny vials of the poison.\n At least, Cadderly hoped it was the poison-one does not often find the opportunity to test such things.\n Even with the apparent success of the brewing, though, there remained one severe limitation. The potion was a drow mix, brewed in the strange magical emanations found only in the Underdark, the lightless world beneath Toril\u0027s surface. It was a well-known fact that if drow poison was exposed to the sun, even for a moment, it would become useless in a very short while. The open air alone could destroy the expensive mixture, so Cadderly had taken great steps, like the spell of darkness, to protect his investment.\n He closed his eyes and worked from memory. First he unscrewed the tiny compartment of his feathered ring and laid the top in a predetermined place to the side, then he removed one of the vials from the box, carefully popping its cork. He poured the gooey contents into his opened ring, then found and replaced the feathered top.\n Cadderly breathed easier. If he had slipped at all, he would have wasted perhaps a thousand gold pieces worth of ingredients and many weeks of labor. Also, if he had spilled even a drop of the poison onto his hand, and if it had found its way into a tiny scratch or nick, he no doubt would be snoozing soundly right beside the box.\n None of that had happened. Cadderly was precise and disciplined when he needed to be, and his many practice sessions with vials of water had paid off.\n The darkness disappeared within the confines of the sealed box when Cadderly closed the lid. Ivan and Pikel were already in the room, surrounding the young scholar, weapons ready and faces grim at the sight of the unexpected darkness.\n \"Just yourself, then,\" Ivan grumbled relaxing his grip on his heavy, two-headed axe.\n Cadderly could not immediately find his breath to reply. He just sat and stared at the dwarven brothers. Both wore armor of interlocking rings, dusty from decades of idleness and rusted in several spots. Ivan wore a helm fashioned with deer antlers-an eight-pointer-while Pikel wore a cooking pot! For all his precautionary armor, Pikel still wore his open-toed sandals.\n Most amazing of all, though, was Pikel\u0027s weapon. Looking upon it, Cadderly understood Ivan\u0027s earlier reference. It was indeed a \"tree,\" the polished trunk of some black and smooth-barked variety that Cadderly did not recognize. The club was fully four feet long, nearly as tall as Pikel, a foot in diameter on the wide end, and less than half that on the narrow, gripping end.\n Looped leather hand-grips were spiked on at various intervals to aid the wielder, but still it seemed an awkward and cumbersome thing.\n As if he sensed Cadderly\u0027s private doubts, Pikel whipped the club about through several attack and defense routines with obvious ease.\n Cadderly nodded his appreciation, sincerely relieved that he had not been on the receiving end of any of Pikel\u0027s mock strikes.\n \"Are ye set to go?\" Ivan asked, adjusting his armor.\n \"Almost,\" Cadderly answered. \"I have just a few more minor preparations, and I want to look in on Danica before we go\"\n \"How can we help ye?\" offered Ivan.\n Cadderly could see that the dwarves were both anxious to get on with it. He knew that it had been many years since the Bouldershoulder brothers had walked into adventure, many years spent cooking meals in the haven that was the Edificant Library. It wasn\u0027t a bad life by anyone\u0027s measure, but the thought of imminent danger and adventure obviously had worked an enchantment over the dwarves.\n There was an unmistakable luster to their dark eyes and their movements were agitated and nervous.\n \"Go to Belago\u0027s alchemy shop,\" Cadderly replied, thinking it best to keep the dwarves busy. He described the distillation equipment and the potion that Belago was brewing for him. \"If he has any more for me, bring it back,\" Cadderly instructed, thinking the task simple enough.\n The dwarves already had hopped off down the hallway when Cadderly realized that he hadn\u0027t seen Belago about lately, not since before the curse had taken hold of the library. What had happened to the alchemist? Cadderly wondered. Was the shop still operational? Were the proper mixtures for blending his 0ill of Impact still slipping in the precise amounts through the hoppers? Cadderly shrugged away his worries, trusting in Ivan and Pikel to use their best judgment.\n Percival was at the window again, chattering with his customary excitement. Cadderly went over and leaned on the sill, bending to put his face close to his little friend\u0027s and listen intently.\n Cadderly could not understand the squirrel\u0027s talk, of course, no more than a child could understand a pet dog\u0027s, but he and Percival had developed quite an emotive rapport, and he knew well enough that Percival comprehended some simple words or phrases, mostly those pertaining to food.\n \"I will be gone for a while,\" Cadderly said. The squirrel probably wouldn\u0027t understand so complex a message, he realized, but talking to Percival often helped Cadderly sort through his own confusion. Percival never really provided any answers, but Cadderly often found them hidden within his own words.\n Percival sat up on his hind legs, licking his forepaws and running them quickly over his face.\n \"Something bad has happened,\" Cadderly tried to explain, \"something that I caused. Now I am going to fix it.\"\n His somber tone, if not his words, had a calming effect on the rodent. Percival stopped licking and sat very still.\n \"So I will be gone,\" Cadderly continued, \"down below the library, in the deep tunnels that are no longer used.\"\n Something he had said apparently struck the squirrel profoundly. Percival ran in tight circles, chattering and clicking, and it was a very long while before Cadderly could calm the beast down.\n He knew that Percival had something important-by Percival\u0027s standards-to tell him, but he had no time for the squirrel\u0027s distractions.\n \"Do not worry,\" Cadderly said, as much to himself as to Percival. \"I will return soon, and then all will be as it was.\" The words sounded hollow to him. Things would not be as they had been.\n Even if he managed to close the smoking bottle, and even if that simple act removed the curse, it wouldn\u0027t bring back the priests of Ilmater or the dead gluttons in the dining room.\n Cadderly shook those dark thoughts away. He could not hope to succeed if he began his quest in despair.\n \"Do not worry!\" he said again, firmly.\n Again the squirrel went crazy, and this time, Cadderly realized, from the direction of Percival\u0027s gaze, the source of the excitement. Cadderly looked back over his shoulder, expecting to see that Ivan and Pikel had returned.\n He saw instead Kierkan Rufo, and more pointedly, the dagger in Rufo\u0027s hand.\n \"What is it?\" Cadderly asked weakly, but he needed no verbal answer to decipher the man\u0027s intent.\n Rufo\u0027s left eye was still bruised and closed, and his nose pointed as much toward his cheek as straight ahead. His ugly wounds only accentuated the look of sheer hatred in his cold, dark eyes.\n \"Where is your light now?\" the tall man sneered. \"But then, it would not do you much good, would it?\" He limped noticeably, but his approach was steady.\n \"What are you doing?\" Cadderly asked him.\n \"Is not the mighty Cadderly smart enough to figure that out?\" Rufo mocked him.\n \"You do not want to do this,\" Cadderly said as calmly as he could. \"There are consequences ...\"\n \"Wait?\" Rufo cried wildly. \"Oh, but I do indeed want to do this. I want to hold your heart in my hands. I want to bring it to your dear Danica and show her who was the stronger.\"\n Cadderly looked for some retort. He thought of mentioning the obvious weakness in Rufo\u0027s plan-if he did bring Cadderly\u0027s heart to Danica, she would kill him-but even that, Cadderly guessed, would not stop Kierkan Rufo. Rufo was under the curse fully, following its devious call with no regard for consequences. Reluctantly, but with no apparent options, Cadderly slipped one finger inside the loop of his spindle-disk cord and moved right up against the side of his bed.\n Rufo came straight in, dagger leading, and Cadderly rolled sideways across the bed, just getting out of the angular man\u0027s long reach.\n Rufo jumped back quickly, faster than Cadderly expected he could move, to cut off Cadderly\u0027s angle for the door. He rushed around the bottom of the bed, launching a wide, arcing swing at Cadderly\u0027s belly.\n Cadderly easily kept back beyond the dagger, then he retaliated, snapping his spindle-disks above Rufo\u0027s swinging arm. Rufo\u0027s already broken nose crackled under the impact and a new stream of blood flowed thickly over the dried stains on his lip. Rufo, obsessed with utter hatred, shook away the minor hit and came on.\n Though the blow had not been very solid, it still had almost broken the rhythm of Cadderly\u0027s working wrist. He managed to coax the disks back to his hand, but the cord was now loosely wound and he couldn\u0027t immediately strike again effectively. Rufo seemed to sense his weakness. He grinned wickedly and came in again.\n Percival saved Cadderly\u0027s life, leaping from the window to land squarely on Rufo\u0027s face. With a single swipe, Rufo sent the squirrel flying across the room, and Percival had done no real damage, but Cadderly had not wasted the time.\n With Rufo distracted, he had snapped the spindle-disks straight down and back up several times to realign and tighten the cord.\n Rufo seemed not to even notice the twin lines of blood running down his face from his newest wound, a small bite on his cheek from Percival. \"I will hold your heart in my hands!\" he promised again, laughing insanely.\n Cadderly jerked his arm once, and then again, feigning a throw to keep Rufo off guard. Between dodges, Rufo managed a few weak thrusts that did not come near to hitting the mark. Cadderly launched the disks finally, in a long and wide throw that brought them to the very end of their reach. He flicked his wrist, bringing the disks back to his grasp, but not with the usual suddenness.\n Rufo measured the pace of the throws and bided his time. The disks came on again, and Rufo leaned back, then rushed toward Cadderly right behind them as they retracted.\n Cadderly\u0027s bait had worked. On this throw, he had shortened up on the cord, bringing the spindle-disks smacking back into his palm much more quickly than Rufo had anticipated. Rufo had barely taken his first step when the young scholar\u0027s weapon shot out again, deliberately low.\n Rufo squealed in shock and pain and grasped at his smashed kneecap, his leg nearly buckling. He was under the influences of the chaos curse, though, and nearly impervious to pain. His squeal became a growl and he plowed ahead, slashing wildly.\n Again Cadderly had to dive across the bed to avoid the blade, but when he came up this time, Kierkan Rufo had already circled the bottom of the bed and stood facing him. Cadderly knew that he was in trouble. He could not trade hits, dagger against spindle-disks. Normally, the disks might have proven effective, but in Rufo\u0027s state of mind, nothing short of a perfect and powerful strike would slow him. That type of attack would be risky indeed for Cadderly, and he doubted that he could even get one through his wild opponent\u0027s defenses.\n They traded feints and teasing lunges for a few moments, Rufo grinning and Cadderly wondering if he had a better chance by diving out the window.\n Then the whole building shook suddenly as if it had been hit by lightning. The explosion rolled on for several seconds and Cadderly understood its source when he heard a single word from the corridor.\n \"Oo!\"\n Rufo hesitated and glanced over his shoulder, toward the open door. Cadderly realized that his sudden advantage wasn\u0027t really fair, but decided immediately to worry about that later. He cocked his arm and let go with all his strength. Rufo turned back just in time to catch the soaring disks right between the eyes.\n Rufo\u0027s head snapped straight back, and when he righted himself again, he was no longer grinning. A startled, stupefied look came over him and his eyes crossed, as if they were both straining to see the newest bruise.\n Cadderly, too transfixed to take his gaze from Rufo\u0027s contorted features, heard the dagger hit the floor. A moment later, Rufo followed it down with a crash. Still Cadderly did not react. He just stood there, his spindle-disks hanging by his side at the end of their cord, spinning end-around-end.\n When Cadderly finally reached down to wind his weapon, Percival stomach turned over. The spindle-disks were covered in blood and one had a piece of Rufo\u0027s eyebrow glued onto it by the thick, drying red fluid. Cadderly slipped down to the bed and let the disks fall to the floor. He felt betrayed, by himself and by his toy.\n All priests of the library were required to train with some weapon, usually a more conventional instrument of destruction, such as the quarterstaff, mace, or club. Cadderly had begun with the staff, and could use his ram-headed walking stick fairly well if the occasion arose, but he was never really comfortable with carrying any weapon. He lived in a dangerous world, so he was told, but he had spent the majority of his life in the secure confines of the Edificant Library. He had never even seen a goblin, except for a dead one once, that being one of the library\u0027s most wretched servants, who was said to be a half-breed. The headmasters had not allowed him to bend the rule of preparedness, though; every priest was required to train.\n Cadderly had come across the spindle-disks in an archaic halfling treatise, and had quickly constructed his own. Some of the headmasters balked at his new choice, calling it more a toy than a weapon, but it fit all of the requirements set out in the ethical codes of Deneir. The vocal opposition, particularly Headmaster Avery\u0027s, only strengthened Cadderly\u0027s resolve to use the ancient weapon.\n For Cadderly, the spindle-disks had replaced hours of savage fighting with hours of enjoyable playing. He learned a dozen tricks, tests of skill that didn\u0027t hurt anybody, with his new toy, for a toy he, too, secretly considered it. Now, though, covered in Rufo\u0027s blood, the spindle-disks did not seem so amusing.\n Rufo groaned and shifted slightly, and Cadderly was glad that he was still alive. He took a deep breath and reached down for the disks, determinedly reminding himself of the gravity of the task ahead, and that he would have to be brave and thick-skinned to see it through.\n Percival was on the bed at his side, lending further support. Cadderly rubbed a finger down the white squirrel\u0027s smooth coat, then nodded gravely and rewound his weapon.\n \"He dead?\" asked Ivan, entering the room with a smoldering Pikel at his heels. Percival darted out the open window, and Cadderly, when he looked upon the brothers, nearly joined him. Ivan\u0027s antlers, face, and beard, which stuck out wildly in several directions, were blackened with soot, and one of Percival heavy boots was now as open-toed as his brother\u0027s sandals.\n Pikel wasn\u0027t much better off. Flecks of ceramics dotted Percival sooty face, his smile showed a missing tooth, and a shard of glass had actually embedded itself right into his iron pot helmet.\n \"Belago was not in?\" Cadderly asked evenly.\n Ivan shrugged, \"Not a sight of that one,\" he replied, \"but me brother found yer potion-what little there was of it\" He held up the small catch basin. \"We figured ye\u0027d be wanting more, so we ...\"\n \"Turned up the spigot,\" Cadderly finished for him.\n \"Boom! \"added Pikel.\n \"He dead?\" Ivan asked again, and the casual tone of the question sent a shudder through Cadderly.\n Both dwarves noted the young scholar\u0027s discomfort. They glanced at each other and shook their heads. \"Ye\u0027d best get the belly for it,\" Ivan said. \"If ye mean to go adventuring, ye\u0027d best get the belly for things that are likely to be falling yer way.\" He led Cadderly\u0027s gaze back to Kierkan Rufo. \"Or at yer feet!\"\n \"I never meant to go adventuring,\" Cadderly replied, somewhat sourly.\n \"And I never meant to be a cook,\" retorted Ivan, \"but that\u0027s what I got, ain\u0027t it? Ye said we got a job to do, and so we do. Let\u0027s get doing what needs doing, and if some try to get in our way, welll...\"\n \"He is not dead,\" Cadderly interjected. \"Put him on the bed and tie him there.\"\n Again Ivan and Pikel exchanged glances, but this time, they nodded in favor of Cadderly\u0027s determined tone.\n \"Oo,\" remarked Pikel, obviously impressed.\n Cadderly wiped his spindle-disks clean, picked up 1ms ram-headed walking stick and a water skin, and headed down the hall. He was relieved to see Danica\u0027s door still warped and tightly wedged, and even more relieved to hear Newander\u0027s calm voice answering his knock.\n \"How is she?\" Cadderly asked immediately.\n \"She is still deep within her meditation,\" Newander replied, \"but she appears comfortable enough.\"\n Cadderly conjured his meditative image of Danica, fighting back the insidious red haze.\n \"I can reverse the spell and let you in,\" the druid offered.\n \"No,\" Cadderly replied, though he truly wanted to see Danica again. His last image of Danica was a comforting one; he could not take the chance that something she did now would worry him and steal his heart from his coming trials. On a more practical level, Cadderly thought it best to let Newander preserve his magical energies. \"When I return, perhaps your spell will no longer be needed,\" he said.\n \"Then you want me to stay with Danica?\"\n \"I have the dwarves with me,\" Cadderly explained. \"They are better suited to the underground tunnels than a druid would be. Stay with her and keep her safe.\"\n Ivan and Pikel came up then, and by the eager gleam in their eyes, Cadderly knew that the time had come to set off. Cadderly glanced back at Danica\u0027s door several times as they walked away, emotionally torn. A large part of him argued against his journey, reasoned that his best course would be to go with his armed friends, sit by Danica\u0027s side, and ride this whole nightmare to its conclusion.\n Cadderly did not find it difficult to argue against that irrational notion. Men were dying all around him. How many more Kierkan Rufos lurked in the shadows, murder in their hearts?\n \"Dear Cadderly,\" came a purring voice that only reinforced the young scholar\u0027s determination.\n Histra stood behind her chamber\u0027s door, opened just a crack, but that was enough to show Cadderly and the dwarves that she wore no more than a filmy, transparent negligee. \"Do come in and sit with me.\"\n \"Oo!\" said Pikel.\n \"She\u0027s wanting more than sitting, boy,\" chuckled Ivan.\n Cadderly ignored them all and ran right by the door. He felt Histra grab at him as he passed and heard her door creak open wider.\n \"Come back here!\" the priestess of Sune screamed, jumping into the middle of the hall.\n \"Oo!\" an admiring Pikel remarked again.\n Histra concentrated deeply, meaning to utter a magical command for her would-be lover to \"Return!\"\n But Pikel, for all Percival obvious enchantment, kept a pragmatic attitude about the situation. As Histra began her spell, he clamped a sooty hand onto her rump and casually tossed her back into her room.\n \"Oo,\" Pikel uttered a third time when he moved into the room to close the door, and Ivan, standing right behind his brother, whole-heartedly agreed. A dozen young men lay sprawled about the room, exhausted by their exploits.\n \"Are you so certain that you want to leave?\" Histra purred at the dirty brothers.\n By the time the blushing dwarves caught up to Cadderly, he was down to the first floor, dipping his water skin into a font in the great hall.\n \"Wretched stuff,\" Ivan whispered to Pikel. \"Oils and water. Tried drinking it once.\" He hung his floppy tongue out in disgust.\n Cadderly smiled at the dwarfs remarks. He had better uses than drinking in mind for the holy water. When the skin was full, he took out a narrow tube, fitted on one end with a rubbery ball of some gooey substance. He popped tins onto the open tip of his water skin and capped it with a smaller ball of the same goo.\n \"You will understand in time,\" was all the explanation he offered to the curious dwarves.\n The Bouldershoulder brothers grew alarmed when the group entered the kitchen and found the place full of priests. Headmaster Avery led the impromptu chefs, though their progress was limited since each of them spent more time stuffing food into his mouth than actually cooking anything.\n More alarming to Cadderly than the eating frenzy was his companions\u0027 reactions. Both seemed on the verge of abandoning the quest, as though some greater compulsions now pulled at them.\n \"Fight it,\" Cadderly said to them, recognizing their growing desires as curse-induced. Ivan and Pikel were protective of their kitchen, and both took extreme satisfaction in keeping the hungriest priests of the library fed to contentment. They looked around at the messy kitchen and the gluttonous priests, and for a moment, Cadderly feared that he would be traveling down to the lower catacombs alone. But Newander\u0027s claims of dwarven resistance to magical enchantment held true this time, for the Bouldershoulders shrugged unhappily at the disaster that had befallen their space, then pushed Cadderly on, prodding him toward the door to the wine cellar.\n The musty stairs were dark and quiet; the torches lining the wall had not been tended. Cadderly opened his light tube and moved down a few steps, waiting there for the brothers to strike torches. Ivan came in last and closed and bolted the iron-bound door, even taking the trouble to slide an iron locking bar into place.\n \"We\u0027ve as much trouble behind as ahead,\" the dwarf explained to Cadderly\u0027s questioning look. \"If that group gets as thirsty as they are hungry, they\u0027ll only bring trouble along with them!\"\n The reasoning seemed sound enough, so Cadderly turned and started down. Pikel grabbed him, though, and took up the lead, tapping his heavy club to his pot helmet.\n \"Keep yerself between us,\" Ivan explained. \"We\u0027ve been on this road before!\"\n His confidence comforted Cadderly, but the clamor as the bulky dwarves thumped and rattled down the stairs did not.\n Their lights intruded into absolute darkness as they came down, but all three sensed that they were not alone. Beside the first wine rack, they found their first clues that someone else had come this way. Broken glass covered the floor and many bottles-bottles that Cadderly had inventoried only a few days before-were missing. The trail led to yet another dead priest. His stomach grossly distended, he lay curled on the floor, surrounded by emptied bottles.\n They heard a shuffle to the side and Cadderly put a narrow beam of light down between the wine racks. Another priest was in there, trying futilely to stand. He was too drunk to even notice the light, and his stomach, too, bulged and sloshed. Despite his stupor, he still held a bottle to his lips, stubbornly forcing more liquid down his throat.\n Cadderly started toward the drunk, but Ivan held him back. \"Show me yer door,\" Ivan said to him, then the dwarf nodded to Pikel. As Cadderly and Ivan headed deeper into the cellar, Pikel moved the other way, between the racks. Cadderly soon heard a thump, a groan, and a bottle breaking on the stone floor.\n \"For his own good,\" Ivan explained.\n They came to the casks where Cadderly had been found and, once again, the young scholar grew confused and frustrated that there was no door to be found. Ivan and Pikel shoved all the casks far away, and the three of them searched every inch of the wall.\n Cadderly stuttered an apology; perhaps his entire theory was misguided. Ivan and Pikel stubbornly continued their search, though, keeping faith in their friend. They found their answers not on the unremarkable wall, but on a series of scratches in the floor.\n \"The casks were dragged,\" Ivan asserted. He bent low to study the dust, the absence of dust, in the marks. \"Not too long ago.\"\n Cadderly\u0027s focused beam made the tracking easy and as they moved across the room, he began to get more excited. \"How could I have missed this?\" he said. He turned the light back to the wine racks.\n \"Ws-Rufo and I-came from over there, so the door could not have been back where we found the piled casks. It was a purposeful deception. I should have known.\"\n \"Ye took a bit on the head,\" Ivan reminded him. \"And it\u0027s a clever trick.\"\n The trail led to yet another cask, tight up against the wall. The companions knew before Ivan even kicked it aside that the mysterious door would indeed be found behind it. Ivan nodding and smiling, moved right up to the door and pulled it, but it did not budge.\n \"Locked,\" the dwarf grunted, examining a keyhole above the pull ring. He looked to Percival brother, who nodded eagerly.\n \"Pikel\u0027s one for unlocking doors,\" Ivan explained to Cadderly, and Cadderly got the point when Pikel leveled his tree trunk like a battering ram and lined himself up with the door.\n \"Hold!\" Cadderly said. \"I have a better way.\"\n \"Ye\u0027re a lockpick, too?\" Ivan asked.\n \"Oh,\" groaned a disappointed Pikel.\n \"You could say that,\" Cadderly replied smugly, but instead of instruments for picking locks, he produced the hand-held crossbow. Cadderly had been hoping that he would get to try out Percival newest invention, and he was hardly able to keep from shaking as he cranked the bow and loaded a dart.\n \"Stand back,\" he warned, taking aim at the keyhole. The crossbow clicked and the dart plunked in.\n A split second later, the momentum of the dart collapsed its weak middle section, crushing the vial of 0ill of Impact, and the ensuing explosion left a blackened and blasted hole where the lock had been. The door creaked open only an inch but hung there loosely.\n \"Oh, I\u0027m wanting one of those!\" Ivan cried happily.\n \"Oo oi!\" agreed Pikel.\n Their glee was short-lived, for behind the open door they found, not the top of the broken stairway, as Cadderly had predicted, but a brick wall.\n \"New work,\" Ivan muttered after a quick inspection. He cast a sly glance Cadderly\u0027s way. \"Ye got a dart for this one, boy?\"\n Ivan didn\u0027t wait to hear an answer. He ran his hands over the wall, pushing at certain points as though he was testing its strength. \"Pikel\u0027s got the key,\" he declared and he moved out of the way.\n Cadderly started to protest, but Pikel paid him no heed. The dwarf began a curious whining sound and his stubby legs churned up and down, running in place, as though he were winding himself up like a spring. Then, with a grunt, Pikel charged, Percival battering ram tight against his side.\n Bricks and mortar flew wildly. Several fiery explosions indicated that warding glyphs had been placed on the other side of the wall, but Pikel\u0027s furious charge was not slowed, by either the flimsy wall or the magical wards. Neither was Pikel able to halt his momentum. As Cadderly had told them before, and as he had tried to warn them again, the stairway beyond the short landing was down.\n \"Ooooooooo!\" came Pikel\u0027s diminishing wail, followed by a dull thump.\n \"Me brother!\" Ivan cried, and before Cadderly could stop him, he, too, charged through the opening. His torch flared in the dust cloud for just a moment, then both the light and the dwarf dropped from sight.\n Cadderly winced and shuddered at Ivan\u0027s final words: \"I can see the grou...!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-canticle-the-cleric-quintet-1/page-13.html","bookId":2107,"book":{"id":2107,"title":"The Cleric Quintet: Canticle (The Cleric Quintet #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The evil wizard Aballister has spent two years collecting and brewing a potion of power, as told to him by the imp, Druzil, sent by the Goddess of Poison, Talona.
