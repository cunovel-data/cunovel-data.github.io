{"id":91477,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"The meeting chamber at Castle Trinity was quite different from the great and ornate hall of the Edificant Library. Its ceiling was low and its door squat and barred and heavily guarded. A single triangular table dominated the room, with three chairs on each side, one group for the wizards, one for the fighters, and one for the clerics.\\n\\n Scan the room, Druzil suggested telepathically to Aballister, who was in the room. The imp surveyed through the wizard\u0027s eyes, using their telepathic link to view whatever Aballister was looking at. Aballister did as he was bidden, moving his gaze around the triangular table, first to Ragnor and the other two fighters, then to Barjin and his two cleric companions.\\n\\n Druzil broke the mental connection suddenly and hissed a wicked laugh, knowing that he had left Aballister in complete confusion. He could feel the wizard trying to reestablish the mental link, could hear Aballister\u0027s thoughts calling to him.\\n\\n But Aballister was not in command of their telepathy; the imp had used this mental form of communication for more decades than Aballister had been alive and it was he who decided when and where he and the wizard would link. For now, Druzil had no reason to continue contact; he had seen all that he needed to see. Barjin was in the meeting hall and would be busy there for some time.\\n\\n Druzil found his center of magic, his otherworldly essence, which allowed him to transcend the physical rules governing creatures of this host plane. A few seconds later, the imp faded from sight, becoming transparent, then he was off, flapping down the hallways to a wing of Castle Trinity to which he rarely traveled.\\n\\n It was risky business, Druzil knew, but if the chaos curse was to be in the priest\u0027s hands, then Druzil needed to know more about him.\\n\\n Druzil knew that Barjin\u0027s door would be locked and heavily warded against intrusion, but he considered that a minor problem with one of Barjin\u0027s bodyguards standing rigid in the hall just outside it. Druzil entered the man\u0027s thoughts just long enough to plant a suggestion, a magical request.\\n\\n \"There is an intruder in Barjin\u0027s room,\" came Druzil\u0027s silent beckon.\\n\\n The guard glanced about nervously for a moment, as if seeking the source of the call. He stared long at Barjin\u0027s door-looking right through the invisible imp-then hastily fumbled with some keys, spoke a command word to prevent the warding glyphs from exploding, and entered.\\n\\n Druzil quietly mouthed the same command word and walked in behind.\\n\\n After, a few minutes of inspecting the apparently empty room, the guard shook his head and left, locking the door behind him.\\n\\n Druzil snickered at how easily some humans could be controlled. The imp didn\u0027t have the time or inclination to gloat, though, not with all of the mysterious Barjin\u0027s secrets open for his inspection. The room was ordinary enough for one of Barjin\u0027s stature. A large canopy bed dominated the wall opposite the door, with a night table beside it. Druzil rubbed his hands together eagerly as he headed for the table. Atop it, next to the lamp, was a black-bound book and, next to that, several quills and an ink-well.\\n\\n \"How thoughtful of you to keep a journal,\" Druzil rasped, carefully opening the work. He read through the first entries, dated two years earlier. They were mostly lamentations by Barjin, accounts of his exploits in the northern kingdoms of Vaasa, Damara, and Narfell, to the north.\\n\\n Druzil\u0027s already considerable respect for the priest grew as he devoured the words. Barjin once had commanded an army and had served a powerful master-he gave no direct references to the man, if it was a man-not as a cleric, but as a wizard!\\n\\n Druzil paused to consider this revelation, then hissed and read on. Although formidable, Barjin admitted that he had not been the most powerful of the wizards in his master\u0027s service-again a vague reference to the mysterious master, giving Druzil the impression that perhaps Barjin, even years later, feared to speak the creature\u0027s name aloud or write it down. Barjin\u0027s rise to power had come later, when the army had taken on a religious zeal and his master apparently had assumed godlike proportions.\\n\\n Druzil couldn\u0027t contain a snicker at the striking parallels between the priest\u0027s ascent and the chaos curse\u0027s transformation into a goddess\u0027s direct agent.\\n\\n Barjin had become a priest and headed an army to fulfill his evil master\u0027s desire to conquer the whole of the northland. The plans had fallen through, though, when an order of paladins-Druzil hissed aloud when he read that cursed word-arose in Damara and organized an army of its own.\\n\\n Barjin\u0027s master and most of his cohorts had been thrown down, but Barjin had barely escaped with his life and a portion of the evil army\u0027s accumulated wealth.\\n\\n Barjin had fled south, alone but for a few lackeys. Since his proclaimed \"god\" had been dispatched, his clerical powers had greatly diminished. Druzil spent a while musing over this revelation; nowhere did Barjin mention his claimed meeting with Talona\u0027s avatar.\\n\\n The journal went on to tell of Barjin\u0027s joining the triumvirate at Castle Trinity-again with no mention of the avatar. Druzil snickered aloud at Barjin\u0027s opportunism. Even a year ago, coming in as a pitiful refugee, Barjin had duped Castle Trinity\u0027s leaders, had used their fanaticism against them.\\n\\n After only a month in the castle, Barjin had ascended to the third rank in the priestly hierarchy, and after only a few more weeks, Barjin had taken over undisputed command as Talona\u0027s chief representative. And yet, Druzil realized as he flipped quickly through the pages, Barjin thought not enough about his goddess to give her more than a few passing references in his journal.\\n\\n Aballister was correct: Barjin was a hypocrite, a fact that hardly seemed to matter. Again Druzil snickered aloud at the irony, at the pure chaos.\\n\\n Druzil knew the rest of Barjin\u0027s story well enough; he had been present long before Barjin ever arrived. The journal, sadly, did not offer any further revelations, but the imp was not disappointed when he dosed the book; there were too many other items to be investigated.\\n\\n Barjin\u0027s new vestments, a conical cap and expensive purple robes embroidered in red with the new insignia of the triumvirate, hung beside the bed. An offspring of Talona\u0027s symbol, the three teardrops inside a triangle\u0027s points, this one sported a trident, its three prongs tipped by teardrop-shaped bottles, much like the one carrying the chaos curse. Barjin had designed it personally, and only Ragnor had offered any resistance.\\n\\n \"So you do plan to spread the word of your god,\" Druzil muttered a few moments later when he discovered Barjin\u0027s bedroll, folded tent, and stuffed backpack under the bed. He reached for the items, then jumped back suddenly, sensing a presence in that pile. He felt the beginnings of a telepathic communication, but not from Aballister. Eagerly, the imp reached under the bed and pulled the items out, recognizing the telepathic source immediately as Barjin\u0027s magical mace.\\n\\n \"Screaming Maiden,\" Druzil said, echoing the item\u0027s telepathic declaration and examining the crafted item. Its obsidian head was that of a pretty young girl, strangely innocuous and appealing. Druzil saw through the grotesque facade. He knew this was not a weapon of the material plane, but one that had been forged in the Abyss, or in the Nine Hells, or in Tarterus, or in one of the other lower planes. It was sentient, obviously, and hungry. More than anything else, Druzil could feel its hunger, its blood-lust. He watched in joyful amazement as the mace enhanced that point, its obsidian head twisting into a leering visage, a fanged maw opening wide.\\n\\n Druzil clapped his padded hands together and smiled wickedly. His respect for Barjin continued to mount, for any mortal capable of wielding such a weapon must be powerful indeed. Rumors around the fortress expressed disdain that Barjin did not favor the poisoned dagger, the usual weapon of Talona\u0027s clerics, but, seeing this mace up close and sensing its terrible power, Druzil agreed with the priest\u0027s choice.\\n\\n Inside the rolled tent Druzil found a brazier and tripod nearly as intricate and rune-covered as Aballister\u0027s. \"You are a sorcerer, too, Barjin,\" the imp whispered, wondering what future events that might imply. Already Druzil imagined what his life might be like if he had stepped through the brazier to Barjin\u0027s call instead of Aballister\u0027s.\\n\\n The thick backpack held other wondrous items. Druzil found a deep, gem-encrusted bowl of beaten platinum, no doubt worth a king\u0027s fortune. Druzil placed it carefully on the floor and reached back into the pack, as exuberant as a hungry ore shoving its arm down a rat hole.\\n\\n He pulled out a solid and heavy object, fist-sized and wrapped in black doth. Whatever was inside dearly emanated magical energies, and Druzil took care to lift only one comer of the doth to peek in. He beheld a huge black sapphire, recognized it as a necromancer\u0027s stone, and quickly rewrapped it in the shielding cloth. If exposed, such a stone could send out a call to the dead, summoning ghosts or ghouls, or any other netherworld monsters in the area.\\n\\n Of similar magical properties was the small ceramic flask that Druzil inspected next. He unstoppered it and sniffed, sneezing as some ashes came into his ample nose.\\n\\n \"Ashes?\" the imp whispered curiously, peering in. Under the black cloth, the necromancer\u0027s stone pulsed, and Druzil understood. \"Long dead spirit,\" he muttered, quickly dosing the flask.\\n\\n Nothing else showed to be of any particular interest, so Druzil carefully rewrapped and replaced everything as he had found it. He hopped up on the comfortable bed, secure with his invisibility, and relaxed, pondering all that he had learned. This Barjin was a diversified human-priest, wizard, general, dabbling in sorcery, necromancy, and who could guess what else.\\n\\n \"Yes, a very resourceful human,\" Druzil decided. He felt better about Barjin\u0027s involvement in the chaos curse. He checked in telepathically with Aballister for just a moment, to make certain that the meeting was in full swing, then congratulated himself on his cunning and folded his plump hands behind his head.\\n\\n Soon he was fast asleep.\\n\\n \"We have only the one suitable bottle,\" said Aballister, representing the wizards. \"The ever-smoking devices are difficult to create, requiring rare gems and metals, and we all know how costly it was to brew even a small amount of the elixir.\" He felt Barjin\u0027s stare boring into him at the reference to the cost.\\n\\n \"Do not speak of the Most Fatal Horror as an elixir,\" the clerical leader commanded. \"Once it may have been just a magical potion, but now it is much more.\"\\n\\n \"Tuanta Quiro Miancay,\" chanted the other two priests, scarred and ugly men with blotchy tattoos covering nearly every inch of their exposed skin.\\n\\n Aballister returned Barjin\u0027s glare. He wanted to scream at Barjin\u0027s hypocrisy, to shake the other clerics into action against him, but Aballister wisely checked his outburst. He knew that any accusations against Barjin would produce the opposite results and that he would become the target of the faithful. Druzil\u0027s estimation of Barjin had been correct, Aballister had to admit. The priest had indeed consolidated his power.\\n\\n \"Brewing the Most Fatal Horror,\" conceded Aballister, \"has depleted our resources. To begin again and create more, and also acquire another bottle, could well prove beyond our limits.\"\\n\\n \"Why do we need these stupid bottles?\" interrupted Ragnor. \"If the stuffs a god as you say, then\\n\\n ...\"\\n\\n Barjin was quick to answer. \"The Most Fatal Horror is merely an agent of Talona,\" the priest explained calmly. \"In itself, it is not a god, but it will aid us to comply with Talona\u0027s edicts.\"\\n\\n Ragnor\u0027s eyes narrowed dangerously. It was obvious that the volatile ogrillon\u0027s patience had just about expired.\\n\\n \"All of your followers embrace Tuanta Quiro Miancay,\" Barjin reminded Ragnor, \"embrace it with all their hearts.\" Ragnor eased back in his seat, flinching at the threatening implications.\\n\\n Aballister studied Barjin curiously for a long while, awed by how easily the priest had calmed the ogrillon. Barjin was tall, vigorous, and imposing, but he was no match physically for Ragnor.\\n\\n Usually, physical strength was all that mattered to the powerful fighter; Ragnor normally showed the clerics and wizards less respect than he gave to even his lowliest soldiers. Barjin seemed to be the exception, though; especially of late, Ragnor had not openly opposed him on any issue.\\n\\n Aballister, while concerned, was not surprised. He knew that Barjin\u0027s powers went far beyond the priest\u0027s physical abilities. Barjin was a charmer and a hypnotist, a careful strategist who weighed his opponent\u0027s mind-set above all else and used spells as often for simple enhancement of a favorable situation as to affect those he meant to destroy. Just a few weeks earlier, a conspiracy had been discovered within the evil triumvirate. The single prisoner had resisted Ragnor\u0027s interrogations, at the price of incredible pain and several toes, but Barjin had the wretch talking within an hour, willingly divulging all that he knew about his fellow conspirators.\\n\\n Whispers said that the tortured man actually believed Barjin was an ally, right up until the priest casually bashed in his skull. Aballister did not doubt those whispers and was not surprised. That was how Barjin worked; few could resist the priest\u0027s hypnotic charisma. Aballister did not know much of Barjin\u0027s former deity, lost in the wastelands of Vaasa, but what he had seen of the refugee priest\u0027s spell repertoire was beyond the norm that he would expect of clerics.\\n\\n Again Aballister referred to the whispers for his answers, rumors that indicated Barjin dabbled in wizardry as well as clerical magic.\\n\\n Barjin was still speaking reverently of the elixir when Aballister turned his attention back to the meeting. The priest\u0027s preaching held the other clerics, and Ragnor\u0027s two fighter companions, awestruck. Aballister shook his head and dared not interrupt. He considered again the course that his life had taken, how the avatar had led him to Druzil, and Druzil had delivered the recipe.\\n\\n Then the avatar had led Barjin to Castle Trinity. That was the part of the puzzle that did not fit in Aballister\u0027s reasoning. After a year of watching the priest, Aballister remained convinced that Barjin was no true disciple of Talona, but again he reminded himself that Barjin, sincere or not, was furthering the cause, and that because of Barjin\u0027s purse and influence, all the region might soon be claimed in the goddess\u0027s name.\\n\\n Aballister let out a profound sigh; such were the paradoxes of chaos.\\n\\n \"Aballister?\" Barjin asked. The wizard cleared his throat nervously and glanced around, realizing he had missed much of the conversation.\\n\\n \"Ragnor was inquiring about the necessity of the bottles,\" Barjin politely explained.\\n\\n \"The bottles, yes,\" Aballister stuttered. \"The elix- ... the Most Fatal Horror is potent with or without them. Minute amounts are all that are required for the chaos curse to take effect, but it will last only a short while. With the ever-smoking bottles, the god-stuff is released continually. We have created just a few drops, but I believe there is enough liquid to fuel the ever-smoking bottle for months, perhaps years, if the mixture within the bottle is correct.\"\\n\\n Barjin looked around and exchanged nods with his clerical companions. \"We have decided that Talona\u0027s agent is ready,\" he declared.\\n\\n \"You have ...\" the wizard Dorigen stammered in disbelief.\\n\\n Aballister stared long and hard at Barjin. He had meant to take command of the meeting and suggest just what the priest was getting at; again Barjin had thought one step ahead of him, had stolen his thunder.\\n\\n \"We are the representatives of Talona,\" Barjin coolly replied to Dorigen\u0027s outrage. His companions bobbed their heads stupidly.\\n\\n Aballister\u0027s clenched fingers nearly tore a chunk out of his oaken chair.\\n\\n \"The goddess has spoken to us, has revealed her wishes,\" Barjin continued smugly. \"Our conquests will soon begin!\"\\n\\n Ragnor beat a fist on the table in excited agreement; now the priest was speaking in terms the ogrillon warrior could understand. \"Who are you planning for carrying the bottle?\" Ragnor asked bluntly.\\n\\n \"I will carry it,\" Aballister quickly put in. He knew as soon as he heard his own words that his claim sounded desperate, a last attempt to salvage his own position of power.\\n\\n Barjin shot him an incredulous look.\\n\\n \"It was I who met Talona\u0027s avatar,\" Aballister insisted, \"and I who discovered the recipe for the Most Fatal Horror.\"\\n\\n \"For that, we thank you,\" remarked the priest in a condescending tone. Aballister started to protest, but sank back in Percival chair as a magical message was wispered into his ear. Do not fight with me over this, wizard, Barjin quietly warned.\\n\\n Aballister knew that the critical moment was upon him. \u0026#352; he gave in now, he felt he might never recover his standing in Castle Trinity, but if he argued against Barjin, against the religious fury that the priest had inspired, he would surely split the order and might find himself badly outnumbered.\\n\\n \"The priests of Talona will carry the bottle, of course,\" Barjin answered Ragnor. \"We are the true disciples.\"\\n\\n \"You are one leg of a ruling triumvirate,\" Aballister dared to remind him. \"Do not claim the Most Fatal Horror solely as your own.\"\\n\\n Ragnor did not see things quite the same way. \"Leave it to the priests,\" the ogrillon demanded.\\n\\n Aballister\u0027s surprise disappeared as soon as he realized that the brutish fighter, suspicious of magic, was simply relieved that he would not have to carry the bottle.\\n\\n \"Agreed,\" Barjin quickly put in. Aballister started to speak out, but Dorigen put a hand over his arm and gave him a look that begged him to let it go.\\n\\n \"You have something to say, good wizard?\" Barjin asked.\\n\\n Aballister shook his head and sank even deeper into his chair, and even deeper into despair.\\n\\n \"Then it is settled,\" said Barjin. \"The Most Fatal Horror will descend upon our enemies, carried by my second-\" he nodded to the priests on his right and on his left \"-and my third.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" Aballister blurted, seeing a way to salvage something of this disaster. All gazes descended upon him; he saw Ragnor put a hand to Percival sword hilt. \"Your second?\" the wizard asked, and now it was he who feigned an incredulous tone. \"Your third?\" Aballister rose from his chair and held his arms out stretched.\\n\\n \"Is this not the direct agent of our goddess?\" he preached. \"Is this not the beginning of our greatest ambitions? No, only Barjin is fit to carry such a precious artifact. Only Barjin can properly begin the reign of chaos.\" The gathering turned as one to Barjin and Aballister returned to his seat, thinking that he had at last outmaneuvered the clever priest. If he could get Barjin out of Castle Trinity for a time, he could reestablish Percival claim as the chief speaker for the brotherhood.\\n\\n Unexpectedly, the priest didn\u0027t argue. \"I will carry it,\" he said. He looked to the other, startled clerics and added, \"And I will go alone.\"\\n\\n \"All the fun for you?\" Ragnor complained. \"Merely the first battle of the war,\" Barjin responded.\\n\\n \"My warriors desire battle,\" Ragnor pressed. \"They hunger for blood!\"\\n\\n \"They will have all that they can drink and more!\" Barjin snapped. \"But I will go first and cripple our enemies. When I return, Ragnor can lead the second assault.\"\\n\\n This seemed to satisfy the ogrillon, and now Aballister understood Barjin\u0027s salvaging ploy. By going alone, the priest would not only leave his clerical cohorts to keep an eye on things, but he would leave Ragnor and his soldiers. Always vying for power, the ogrillon, with the prodding of the remaining clerics, would not allow Aballister and the wizards to regain a firm foothold.\\n\\n \"Where will you loose it?\" Aballister asked. \"And when?\" \"There are preparations to be made before I leave,\" Barjin answered, \"things that only a priest, a true disciple, would understand. As to where, let it be of no concern to you.\" \"But-\" Aballister started, only to be interrupted sharply.\\n\\n \"Talona alone will tell me,\" Barjin growled with finality. Aballister glared in outrage but did not respond. Barjin was a slippery opponent; every time Aballister had him cornered, he merely invoked the name of the goddess, as if that answered everything.\\n\\n \"It is decided,\" Barjin continued, seeing no response forthcoming. \"This meeting is at an end.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, go away,\" Druzil slurred, both audibly and telepathically. Aballister was looking for him, trying to get into his thoughts. Druzil smiled at his superiority in keeping the wizard out and lazily rolled over.\\n\\n Then the imp realized what Aballister\u0027s call might signify. He sat up with a start and looked into Aballister\u0027s mind just long enough to see that the wizard had returned to his own room. Druzil hadn\u0027t meant to sleep this long, had wanted to be far from this place before the meeting adjourned.\\n\\n Druzil held very still when the door opened and Barjin entered the room.\\n\\n If he had been more attentive, the priest might have sensed the invisible presence. Barjin had other things on his mind, though. He rushed for the bed and Druzil recoiled, thinking Barjin meant to attack him. But Barjin dropped to his knees and reached eagerly for his pack and Percival enchanted mace.\\n\\n \"You and I,\" Barjin said to the weapon, holding it out before him, \"will spread the word of their goddess and reap the rewards of chaos. It has been too long since you feasted on the blood of humans, my pet, far too long.\" The mace couldn\u0027t audibly reply, of course, but Druzil thought he saw a smile widen on the pretty girl\u0027s sculpted face.\\n\\n \"And you,\" Barjin said into the backpack, to the ceramic, ash-filled flask as far as Druzil could tell. \"Prince Khalif. Could it be the time for you to walk the earth again?\" Barjin snapped the backpack shut and roared with such sincere and exuberant laughter that Druzil almost joined in.\\n\\n The imp promptly reminded himself that he and Barjin were not, as yet, formally allied, and that Barjin would most definitely prove a dangerous enemy. Fortunately for the imp, Barjin, in his haste, had not closed the door behind him. Druzil crawled off the bed, using Barjin\u0027s laughter as cover, and slipped out the door, wisely uttering the password for the warding glyph as he crossed the threshold.\\n\\n Barjin left Castle Trinity five days later, bearing the ever-smoking bottle. He traveled with a small entourage of Ragnor\u0027s fighters, but they would only serve as escorts as far as the human settlement of Carradoon, near Impresk Lake on the southeastern edge of the Snowflake Mountains.\\n\\n Barjin would go alone from there to Percival final destination, which he and his clerical conspirators would still not reveal to the other leaders of Castle Trinity.\\n\\n Back at the fortress, Aballister and the wizards waited as patiently as possible, confident that their turn would come. Ragnor\u0027s force was not so patient, though. The ogrillon wanted battle, wanted to begin the offensive right away. Ragnor was not a stupid creature, though. He knew that Percival small force, only a few hundred strong unless he managed to entice the neighboring goblinoid tribes to join in, would not have an easy time of conquering the lake, the mountains, and the forest.\\n\\n Still, and despite all Percival reasoning, Ragnor was hungry. Since Percival very first day at Castle Trinity, nearly five years before, the ogrillon had vowed revenge on Shilmista Forest, on the elves who had defeated Percival tribe and driven him and the other refugees far from the wood.\\n\\n Every member of Castle Trinity, from lowly soldier to wizard to priest, had spoken often of the day they would rise from their disguised holes and blacken the region. All now held their breath, awaiting Barjin\u0027s return, awaiting confirmation that the conquest had begun.\\n\\n The cloaked figure moved slowly toward Danica. Thinking it a monk of some obscure and eccentric sect-and such monks were usually hostile and dangerous, determined to prove their fighting prowess against any other monks they encountered-the woman gathered up the pile of parchments she had been studying and quickly moved to another table. The tall figure, cowl pulled low to hide its face, turned to pursue, its feet making unrecognizable scuffling noises on the stone floor.\\n\\n Danica looked around. It was late; this study hall, on the second floor above the library, was nearly empty and Danica decided that it might be time for her to retire, too. She realized that she was exhausted, and she wondered if she might be imagining things.\\n\\n The figure came on, slowly, menacingly, and Danica thought that perhaps it was not some other monk. What horrors might that low cowl be hiding? she wondered. She gathered the parchments again and started boldly for the main aisle, though that course meant passing right by the figure.\\n\\n A hand shot out and caught her shoulder. Danica stifled a startled cry and spun about to face the shadowy cowl, losing many of her scrolls in the action. As she collected her wits, though, Danica realized that it was no skeletal apparition holding her in an icy, undead grip. It was a human hand, warm and gentle, and showing signs of ink near the fingernails. The hand of a scribe. \"Fear not!\" the specter rasped.\\n\\n Danica knew that voice too well to be deceived by the breathless mask. She scowled and crossed her arms over her chest.\\n\\n Understanding that the joke was ended, Cadderly removed his hand from Danica\u0027s shoulder and quickly pulled back the cowl. \"Greetings!\" he said, smiling widely into Danica\u0027s frown as though he hoped his mirth to be a contagious thing. \"I thought I might find you here.\" Danica\u0027s silence did not promise reciprocal warmth. \"Do you like my disguise?\" Cadderly went on. \"It had to be convincing for me to get past Avery\u0027s spies. They are everywhere, and Rufo watches my every move even more closely now, though he shared equal punishment.\"\\n\\n \"You both deserved it!\" Danica snapped back. \"After your behavior in the great hall.\"\\n\\n \"So now we clean,\" Cadderly agreed with a resigned shrug. \"Everywhere, every day. It has been a long two weeks, with a longer two still to come.\"\\n\\n \"More than that if Headmaster Avery catches you here,\" Danica warned.\\n\\n Cadderly shook his head and threw up his hands. \"I was cleaning the kitchen,\" he explained. \"Ivan and Pikel threw me out. \u0027It\u0027s me kitchen, boy!\u0027 \" Cadderly said in his best dwarven voice, slamming his fists on his hips and puffing out his chest. \" \u0027If there\u0027s any cleanin\u0027 to be done, it\u0027ll be done by meself! I\u0027m not needing a ...\" Danica reminded him where he was to quiet him and pulled him to the side, behind the cover of some book racks.\\n\\n \"That was Ivan,\" Cadderly said. \"Pikel did not say much. So the kitchen will be cleaned by the dwarves if it is to be cleaned at all, and a good thing, I say. An hour in there could put an end to my appetite for some time to come!\"\\n\\n \"That does not excuse you from your work,\" Danica protested.\\n\\n \"I am working,\" Cadderly retorted. He pulled aside the front of his heavy woolen cloak and lifted a foot, revealing a sandal that was half shoe and half scrubbing brush. \"Every step I take cleans the library a little bit more.\"\\n\\n Danica couldn\u0027t argue with Cadderly\u0027s unending stream of personalized logic. In truth, she was glad that Cadderly had come to visit her. She hadn\u0027t seen much of him in the last two weeks and found that she missed him dearly. Also, on a more practical level, Danica was having trouble deciphering some important parchments and Cadderly was just the person to help her.\\n\\n \"Could you look at these?\" she asked, retrieving the fallen scrolls.\\n\\n \"Master Penpahg D\u0027Ahn?\" Cadderly replied, hardly surprised. He knew that Danica had come to the Edificant Library more than a year before to study the collected notes of Penpahg D\u0027Ahn of Ashanath, the grandmaster monk who had died five hundred years before. Danica\u0027s order was small and secretive, and few in this part of the Realms had ever heard of Penpahg D\u0027Ahn, but those who studied the grandmaster\u0027s fighting and concentration techniques gave their lives over to his philosophies wholeheartedly. Cadderly had only seen a fraction of Danica\u0027s notes, but those had intrigued him, and he certainly could not dispute Danica\u0027s fighting prowess. More than half of the proud Oghman clerics had been walking around rubbing numerous bruises since the fiery young woman had come to the library.\\n\\n \"I am not quite certain of this interpretation,\" Danica explained, spreading a parchment over a table.\\n\\n Cadderly moved to her side and examined the scroll. It began with a picture of crossed fists, which indicated that it was a battle technique, but then showed the single open eye indicating a concentration technique. Cadderly read on. \"Gigel Nugel,\" he said aloud, then he thought that over for a moment. \"Iron Skull. The maneuver is called Iron Skull.\"\\n\\n Danica banged a fist onto the table. \"As I believed!\" she said.\\n\\n Cadderly was almost afraid to ask. \"What is it?\" Danica held the parchment up over the table\u0027s lamp, emphasizing a small, nearly lost sketch in the lower comer. Cadderly eyed it closely. It appeared to be a large rock sitting atop a man\u0027s head. \"Is that supposed to be a representation of Penpahg D\u0027Ahn?\" he asked. Danica nodded.\\n\\n \"So now we know how he died,\" Cadderly snickered. Danica snapped the parchment away, not appreciating the humor. Sometimes Cadderly\u0027s irreverence crossed the boundaries of her considerable tolerance.\\n\\n \"I am sorry,\" Cadderly apologized with a low bow. \"Truly Penpahg D\u0027Ahn was an amazing person, but are you saying he could break stone with his head?\"\\n\\n \"It is a test of discipline,\" Danica replied, her voice edged with mounting excitement. \"As are all of Grandmaster Penpahg D\u0027Ahn\u0027s teachings. The grandmaster was in control of his body, of his very being.\"\\n\\n \"I am quite certain that you would forget my very name if Master Penpahg D\u0027Ahn returned from the grave,\" Cadderly said mournfully.\\n\\n \"Forget who\u0027s name?\" Danica replied calmly, not playing into his game.\\n\\n Cadderly cast a hard glare at her but smiled as she smiled, unable to resist her charms. The young scholar grew suddenly serious, though, and looked back to the parchment. \"Promise me that you are not intending to smash your face into a stone,\" he said.\\n\\n Danica crossed her arms over her chest and tilted her head in an obstinate way, silently telling Cadderly to mind Percival own business.\\n\\n \"Danica,\" Cadderly said firmly.\\n\\n In reply, Danica extended one finger and placed it down on the table. Her thoughts turned inward; her concentration had to be complete. She lifted herself by that single extended digit, bending at the waist and bringing her legs up even with the table top. She held the pose for some time, glad for Cadderly\u0027s amazed gape.\\n\\n \"The powers of the body are beyond our comprehension and expectations,\" Danica remarked, shifting to a sitting position on the table and wiggling her finger to show Cadderly that it had suffered no damage. \"Grandmaster Penpahg D\u0027Ahn understood them and learned to channel them to fit his needs. I will not go out this night, nor any night soon, and attempt the Iron Skull, that much I can promise you. You must understand that Iron Skull is but a minor test compared to what I came here to achieve.\"\\n\\n \"Physical suspension,\" Cadderly muttered with obvious distaste.\\n\\n Danica\u0027s face brightened. \"Think of it!\" she said. \"The grandmaster was able to stop his heart, to suspend his very breathing.\"\\n\\n \"There are priests who can do the very same thing,\" Cadderly reminded her, \"and wizards, too. I saw the spell in the book I inscribed ...\"\\n\\n \"This is not a spell,\" Danica retorted. \"Wizards and priests call upon powers beyond their own minds and bodies. Think, though, of the control necessary to do as Grandmaster Penpahg D\u0027Ahn did.\\n\\n He could stop his heart from beating at any time, using only Percival own understanding of his physical being. You above all should appreciate that.\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" Cadderly replied sincerely. His visage softened and he ran the back of Percival hand gently across Danica\u0027s soft cheek. \"But you scare me, Danica. You are relying on tomes a half millennium old for techniques that could be tragic. I do not remember with fondness how my life was before I met you, and I do not want to think of what it would be without you.\"\\n\\n \"I cannot change who I am,\" Danica replied quietly, but without compromise, \"nor will I surrender the goals I have chosen for my life.\"\\n\\n Cadderly considered her words for a few moments, weighing them against his own feelings. He respected everything about Danica, and above all else it was her fire, her willingness to accept and defeat all challenges, that he most loved. To tame her, to put out that fire, Cadderly knew, would be to kill this Danica, his Danica, more surely than any of Penpahg D\u0027Ahn\u0027s seemingly impossible tests ever could.\\n\\n \"I cannot change,\" Danica said again.\\n\\n Cadderly\u0027s reply came straight from his heart. \"I would not want you to.\"\\n\\n Barjin knew that he could not enter the ivy-streaked building through any of its windows or doors.\\n\\n While the Edificant Library was always open to scholars of all nonevil sects, warding glyphs had been placed over every known entrance to protect against those not invited-persons, such as Barjin, dedicated to the spread of chaos and misery.\\n\\n The Edificant Library was an ancient building, and Barjin knew that ancient buildings usually held secrets, even from their present inhabitants.\\n\\n The priest held the red-glowing bottle aloft before his eyes. \"Ws have come to our destination,\"\\n\\n he said, speaking as if the bottle could hear him, \"to where I will secure my position of rulership over Castle Trinity, and over all the region once our conquest is completed.\" Barjin wanted to rush in, find his catalyst, and set the events in motion. He really didn\u0027t believe the elixir was an agent of Talona, but then, Barjin didn\u0027t consider himself an agent of Talona, though he had joined her clerical order. He had adopted the goddess for convenience, for mutual benefit, and knew that as long as his actions furthered the Lady of Poison\u0027s evil designs, she would be content.\\n\\n Barjin spent the rest of the day, which was drizzly and dreary for late spring, in the shadows behind the trees lining the wide road. He heard the midday canticle, then watched many priests and other scholars exit alone or in groups for an early afternoon stroll.\\n\\n The evil priest took a few precautionary measures, casting simple spells that would help him blend into his background and remain undetected. He listened to the casual banter of the passing groups, wondering with amusement how their words might change when he loosed the Most Fatal Horror in their midst.\\n\\n The figure that soon caught Barjin\u0027s attention, though, was neither priest nor scholar. Disheveled and gray haired, with a dirty and stubbly face and skin wrinkled and browned from many years in the sun, Mullivy, the groundskeeper, went about his routines as he had for four decades, sweeping the road and the stairs to the front doors, heedless of the drizzle.\\n\\n Barjin\u0027s wicked grin spread wide. If there was a secret way into the Edificant Library, this old man would know of it.\\n\\n The clouds had broken by sunset, and a beautiful crimson patina lined the mountains west of the library. Mullivy hardly noticed it, though, having seen too many sunsets to be impressed anymore.\\n\\n He stretched the aches out of his old bones and strolled to his small work shed off to the side of the library\u0027s huge main building.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re getting old, too,\" the groundskeeper said to the shack as the door opened with a loud creak. He reached inside, meaning to replace his broom, then stopped abruptly, frozen in place by some power he did not understand.\\n\\n A hand reached around him, prying the broom from his stub born grasp. Mullivy\u0027s mind shouted warnings, but he could not bring his body to react, could not shout or spin to face the person guiding that unexpected hand. He then was pushed into the shed-fell face down, not able to lift an arm to break the fall-and the door dosed behind him. He knew he was not alone.\\n\\n \"You will tell me,\" the sinister voice promised from the darkness.\\n\\n Mullivy hung by his wrists, as he had for several hours. The room was totally black, but the groundskeeper sensed the awful presence all too near.\\n\\n \"I could kill you and ask your corpse,\" Barjin said with a chuckle. \"Dead men talk, I assure you, and they do not lie.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no other way in,\" Mullivy said for perhaps the hundredth time.\\n\\n Barjin knew the old man was lying. At the beginning of the interrogation, the priest had cast spells to distinguish truth from falsehood and Mullivy had failed that test completely. Barjin reached out and gently grabbed the groundskeeper\u0027s stomach in one hand.\\n\\n \"No! No!\" he begged, thrashing and trying to wiggle out of that grip. Barjin held tight and began a soft chant, and soon Mullivy\u0027s insides felt as if they were on fire, his stomach ripped by agony that no man could endure. His screams, primal, hopeless, and helpless, emanated from that pained area.\\n\\n \"Do cry out,\" Barjin chided him. \"All about the shed is a spell of silence, old fool. You will not disturb the slumber of those within the library.\\n\\n \"But then, why would you care for their sleep?\" Barjin asked quietly, his voice filled with feigned sympathy. He released his grip and softly stroked Mullivy\u0027s wounded belly.\\n\\n Mullivy stopped thrashing and screaming, though the pain of the sinister spell lingered.\\n\\n \"To them you are insignificant,\" Barjin purred, and his suggestion carried the weight of magical influences. \"The priests think themselves your betters. They allow you to sweep for them and keep the rain gutters clean, but do they care for your pain? You are out here suffering terribly, but do any of them rush to your aid?\"\\n\\n Mullivy\u0027s heaving breaths settled into a calmer rhythm. \"Still you defend them so stubbornly,\"\\n\\n Barjin purred, knowing that his torture was beginning to wear the groundskeeper down. \"They would not defend you, and still you will not show me your secret, at the cost of your life.\"\\n\\n Even in his most lucid state, Mullivy was not a powerful thinker. His best friend most often was a bottle of stolen wine, and now, in his agony-racked jumble of thoughts, this unseen assailant\u0027s words rang loudly of truth. Why shouldn\u0027t he show this man his secret, the damp, moss-and-spider-filled dirt tunnel that led to the lowest level of the library complex, the ancient and unused catacombs below the wine cellar and the upper dungeon level? Suddenly, as Barjin had planned, Mullivy\u0027s imagined appearance of the unseen assailant softened. In his desperation, the groundskeeper needed to believe that Percival tormentor could actually be his ally.\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t tell them?\" Mullivy asked.\\n\\n \"They will be the last to know,\" Barjin promised hopefully. \"You won\u0027t stop me from getting at the wine?\" Barjin backed off a step, surprised. He understood the old man\u0027s initial hesitance. The groundskeeper\u0027s secret way into the library led to the wine cellar, a stash that the wretch would not easily part with. \"Dear man,\" Barjin purred, \"you may have all the wine you desire-and much more, so much more.\"\\n\\n They had barely entered the tunnel when Mullivy, carrying the torch, turned and waved it threateningly at Barjin. Barjin\u0027s laughter mocked him, but Mullivy\u0027s voice remained firm. \"I showed you the way,\" the groundskeeper declared. \"Now I\u0027m leaving.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Barjin replied evenly. A shrug sent the priest\u0027s traveling cloak to the floor, revealing him in all his splendor. He wore his new vestments, the purple silken robes depicting a trident capped by three red flasks. On his belt was his peculiar mace, its head a sculpture of a young girl. \"You have joined me now,\" Barjin explained. \"You will never be leaving.\"\\n\\n Terror drove Mullivy\u0027s movements. He slapped the burning torch against Barjin\u0027s shoulder and tried to push by, but the priest had prepared himself well before handing the torch to the groundskeeper. The flames did not touch Barjin, did not even singe his magnificent vestments, for they were defeated by a protection spell.\\n\\n Mullivy tried a different tactic, slamming the torch like a club, but the vestments carried a magical armor as solid as metal plate mail and the wooden torch bounced off Barjin\u0027s shoulder without so much as causing the priest to flinch.\\n\\n \"Come now, dear Mullivy,\" Barjin cajoled, taking no offense. \"You do not want me as an enemy.\"\\n\\n Mullivy fell back and nearly dropped the torch. It took Mm a long moment to get past his terror, to even find his breath.\\n\\n \"Lead on,\" Barjin bade him. \"You know this tunnel and the passages beyond. Show them to me.\"\\n\\n Barjin liked the catacombs-dusty and private and filled with the remains of long-dead priests, some embalmed and others only cobweb-covered skeletons. He would have use for them.\\n\\n Mullivy led him through a tour of the level, including the rickety stairwell that led up to the library\u0027s wine cellar and a medium-sized chamber that once had been used as a study for the original library. Barjin thought this room an excellent place to set up his unholy altar, but first he had to see exactly how useful the groundskeeper might prove.\\n\\n They lit several torches and set them in wall sconces, then Barjin led Mullivy to an ancient table, one of many furnishings in the room, and produced his precious baggage. The bottle had been heavily warded back at Castle Trinity; only disciples of Talona or someone of pure heart could even touch it, and only the latter could open it. Like Aballister, Barjin knew this to be an obstacle, but unlike the wizard, the priest believed it a fitting one. What better irony than to have one of pure heart loose the chaos curse?\\n\\n \"Open it, I pray you,\" Barjin said.\\n\\n The groundskeeper studied the flask for a moment, then looked curiously at the priest.\\n\\n Barjin knew Mullivy\u0027s weak spot. \"It is ambrosia,\" the priest lied. \"The drink of the gods. One taste of it and forever after wines will taste to you ten times as sweet, for the lingering effects of ambrosia will never diminish. Drink, I pray you. You have certainly earned your reward.\"\\n\\n Mullivy licked his lips eagerly, took one final look at Barjin, then reached for the glowing bottle. A jolt of electricity shot into him as he touched it, blackening his fingers and throwing him across the room to where he slammed into a wall. Barjin went over and dropped one arm under Mullivy\u0027s shoulder to help him stand.\\n\\n \"I thought not,\" the priest muttered to himself.\\n\\n Still twitching from the blast, his hair dancing wildly with lingering static, Mullivy could not find his voice to reply.\\n\\n \"Fear not,\" Barjin assured him. \"You will serve me in other ways.\" Mullivy noticed then that the priest held his girl\u0027s-head mace in his other hand.\\n\\n Mullivy fell back against the wall and put his arms up defensively, but they were hardly protection from Barjin\u0027s foul weapon. The innocent looking head swung in at the doomed groundskeeper, transforming as it went. The weapon\u0027s image became angular, evil, the Screaming Maiden, her mouth opening impossibly wide, to reveal long, venom-tipped fangs.\\n\\n She bit hungrily through the bone in Mullivy\u0027s forearm and plowed on, crushing and tearing into the man\u0027s chest. He twitched wildly for several agonizing moments, then he slid down the wall and died.\\n\\n Barjin, with many preparations still to make, paid him no heed.\\n\\n Aballister leaned back in his chair, breaking his concentration from his magical mirror but not breaking the connection he had made. He had located Barjin and had recognized the priest\u0027s surroundings: the Edificant Library. Aballister rubbed his hands through his thinning hair and considered the revelation, news that he found more than a little disturbing.\\n\\n The wizard had mixed emotions concerning the library, unresolved feelings that he did not care to examine at this important time. Aballister had actually studied there once, many years before, but his curiosity with denizens of the lower planes had ended that relationship. The host priests thought it a pity that one of Aballister\u0027s potential had to be asked to leave, but they expressed their concerns that Aballister had some trouble distinguishing between good and evil, between proper studies and dangerous practices.\\n\\n The expulsion did not end Aballister\u0027s relationship with the Edificant Library, though. Other events over the ensuing years had served to increase the wizard\u0027s ambiguous feelings toward the place. Now, in the overall plan of regional conquest, Aballister would have greatly preferred to leave the library for last, with him personally directing the attack. He never would have guessed that Barjin would be so daring as to go after the place in the initial assault, believing that the priest would venture to Shilmista, or to some vital spot in Carradoon.\\n\\n \"Well?\" came a question from across the room.\\n\\n \"He is in the Edificant Library,\" Aballister answered grimly. \"The priest has chosen to begin our campaign against our most powerful enemies.\"\\n\\n Aballister anticipated Druzil\u0027s reply well enough to mouth \"bene tellemara\" along with the imp.\\n\\n \"Find him,\" Druzil demanded. \"What is he thinking?\"\\n\\n Aballister put a curious gaze the imp\u0027s way, but if he had any notion to reprimand Druzil, it was lost in his agreement with the demand. He leaned forward again toward the large mirror and scried deeper, into the library\u0027s lower levels, through the cobweb-covered tunnels to the room where Barjin had built his altar.\\n\\n Barjin glanced around nervously for a moment, then apparently recognized the source of the mental connection. \"Well met, Aballister,\" the priest said smugly.\\n\\n \"You take great chances,\" the wizard remarked.\\n\\n \"Do you doubt the power of Tuanta Quiro Miancay?\" Barjin asked. \"The agent of Talona?\"\\n\\n Aballister had no intentions of reopening that unresolvable debate. Before he could respond, another figure moved into the picture, pallid and unblinking, with one broken arm hanging grotesquely and blood covering the left side of its chest.\\n\\n \"My first soldier,\" Barjin explained, pulling Mullivy\u0027s body close to his side. \"I have a hundred more awaiting my call.\"\\n\\n Aballister recognized the \"soldier\" as an animated corpse, a zombie, and, knowing that Barjin was in catacombs no doubt laced with burial vaults, the wizard did not have to ask where he intended to find his army. Suddenly Barjin\u0027s choice to assault the library did not seem so foolhardy; Aballister had to wonder just how powerful his conniving rival might be, or might become. Again the wizard\u0027s mixed feelings about the Edificant Library flooded over him. Aballister wanted to order Barjin out of the place at once, but of course, he had not the power to enforce the demand.\\n\\n \"Do not underestimate me,\" Barjin said, as though he had read the wizard\u0027s mind. \"Once the library is defeated, all the region will be opened to us. Now be gone from here; I have duties to attend that a simple wizard cannot understand.\"\\n\\n Aballister wanted to voice his protest at Barjin\u0027s demeaning tone, but again, he knew that words would carry no real weight. He broke the connection immediately and fell back in his chair, memories welling inside him.\\n\\n \"Bene tellemara,\" Druzil said again.\\n\\n Aballister looked over to the imp. \"Barjin may bring us a great victory much earlier than we expected,\" the wizard said, but there was little excitement in his voice.\\n\\n \"It is an unnecessary risk,\" Druzil spat back. \"With Ragnor\u0027s forces ready to march, Barjin could have found a better target. He could have gone to the elves and loosed the curse there-Ragnor certainly hates them and intends to make them his first target. If we took Shilmista Forest, we could march south around the mountains to isolate the priests, surround the powerful library before they ever even realized that trouble had come to their land.\"\\n\\n Aballister did not argue and wondered again if he had been wise in so easily relinquishing control of the elixir to Barjin. He had justified each action, each failing, but he knew in his heart that his cowardice had betrayed him.\\n\\n \"I must go to him,\" Druzil remarked unexpectedly.\\n\\n After taking a moment to consider the request, Aballister decided not to contest it. Sending Druzil would be a risk, the wizard knew, but he realized, too, that if he had found the strength to take more risks in his earlier meetings with Barjin, he might not now be in so awkward a position.\\n\\n \"Dorigen informed me that Barjin carried an enchanted brazier with him,\" the wizard said, rising and taking up his staff. \"She is the best with sorcery. She will know if Barjin opens a gate to the lower planes in search of allies. When Dorigen confirms the opening, I will open a gate here.\\n\\n Your journey will be a short one. Barjin will not know you as my emissary and will think that he freely summoned you and that it is he who controls you.\"\\n\\n Druzil snapped his batlike wings around him and wisely held his tongue until Aballister had exited the room.\\n\\n \"Your emissary?\" the imp snarled at the closed door.\\n\\n Aballister had a lot to learn. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-canticle-the-cleric-quintet-1/page-5.html","bookId":2107,"book":{"id":2107,"title":"The Cleric Quintet: Canticle (The Cleric Quintet #1)","description":"Storyline: The evil wizard Aballister has spent two years collecting and brewing a potion of power, as told to him by the imp, Druzil, sent by the Goddess of Poison, Talona.
