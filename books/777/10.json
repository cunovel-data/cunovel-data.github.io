{"id":45174,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 9: Bad News.","content":"Neither Leigh nor Jean Martin was at Saumur, when this decision was arrived at. The very night that the town was taken, one of the former\u0027s band, who was wounded and, greatly against his inclination, had been left behind, arrived there on horseback. He was the bearer of terrible news. He was the bearer of terrible news. Early on the previous day, a troop of the enemy\u0027s cavalry had arrived. They had apparently ridden all night, and without exciting any alarm on the way. They had made straight for the chateau, without going into the village. Beyond the fact that they belonged to the force operating from Nantes, none knew the route they had followed. They had doubtless expected to arrest Jean at the chateau but, on finding him absent, had seized his wife, had placed her in their midst, set fire to the chateau, and ridden off before any force could be gathered to oppose them. Jean and Leigh were horror stricken at the news. \"What is to be done?\" the former exclaimed. \"What can be done?\" \"I should say,\" Leigh said, \"that the first thing to do will be to tell the generals that we must, for the present, leave them. Then we must go to Nantes in disguise, find out where she is imprisoned, and see what can be done to rescue her.\" \"Certainly that is the best thing, Leigh. Let us start at once.\" \"It will be daylight in two hours, Jean, and that will make no difference. I will go and talk with my boys. They are asleep together on the steps of the church of Saint Marie. They may be useful to us, and I am sure would follow us anywhere.\" Jean made no reply. He had buried his face in his hands, and deep sobs broke from him. Tears were streaming down Leigh\u0027s cheek as he spoke, but he put his hand upon Jean\u0027s shoulder and said, in a voice which he tried to keep steady: \"It is terrible, Jean, but we must not give up hope. We have beaten the Blues in the field, and it is hard if we cannot manage to beat them, somehow, in this business.\" The other made no reply, and Leigh, feeling that it would be best to leave him to himself for the present, went downstairs. The lad who had brought the message was seated against the wall, holding the horse\u0027s bridle in his hand. Being a stranger in the place, he did not know where to go. \"Come with me, Philippe. The others are all in the great square, a hundred yards away. They got their bread yesterday morning, and will have plenty of it left for you and the horse. It can take a drink at the fountain, in the centre. \"Ah,\" he exclaimed stopping suddenly, \"you said nothing about the child, and we did not think to ask. Did my sister take it away with her, or was it left?\" \"I did not hear, captain. My mother ran into the house crying, and said: \"\u0027The Blues have come, and have set fire to the chateau and carried madame away prisoner. Take the horse and ride to the army, and tell Monsieur Martin what has happened.\u0027 \"I ran into the stable and saddled it, took two loaves of bread, one for him and one for myself, and started. I should have been here in the middle of the day, but I lost my way in the lanes last night, and had to stop till daylight and, even then, rode for a long time in the wrong direction.\" Leaving the lad and horse in the middle of the square, Leigh went to the steps of the church. A great number of peasants were sleeping there. He was not long in finding his own band. He roused Andre and Pierre with some difficulty for, having both been up all the previous night, they slept heavily. \"Come with me,\" Leigh said, as soon as they were sufficiently roused to understand who was speaking to them. \"I want to have a talk with you. \"I have some bad news,\" he went on, as they passed beyond the sleepers; \"the Blues have been at the chateau. They have burned it down, and have carried off Madame Martin.\" Exclamations of rage broke from both the lads. Patsey had, during the months she had spent on the estate, made herself extremely popular among the peasantry; whose cottages she constantly visited, and who always found her ready to listen to their tales of trouble, and to supply dainty food for the sick. The thought, too, that the chateau had been burned down was also a blow, for all the tenantry considered that they had a personal interest in the affairs of their seigneur. \"How was it that there was no defence?\" Andre asked. \"I know that most of the men were away, but surely enough might have been gathered to keep the Blues back, until madame escaped to the woods.\" \"It seems they rode by night, and arrived there soon after day broke. They had evidently come on purpose to seize your lord for, as soon as they found that he was not there, they went away at once, only stopping to set fire to the chateau. They were evidently in a hurry to be off. \"Here is Philippe Rehan, who has brought the news. He only knows what I have told you, as he mounted and rode off at once.\" \"I suppose they have taken our young lord, too?\" \"Philippe does not know about that. He says they came from the direction of Nantes, and no doubt my sister has been taken there.\" \"What is to be done, captain?\" Andre asked, as he and Pierre looked at each other helplessly, in face of this trouble. \"Monsieur Martin and I are going to leave, at once. We don\u0027t know what we are going to do yet, but we shall certainly try, by all means, to get her out of prison. How it is to be managed we have not even thought, but if it can be done, we shall do it. Now, I am sure that we can rely upon your assistance.\" \"We will do anything,\" Andre exclaimed; while Pierre said, \"We will be cut to pieces for you, captain.\" Leigh gave a hand to each. \"I am sure of it,\" he said. \"And the band?\" \"Every one of those we had at first we could answer for,\" Andre replied. \"And I believe that the others can be trusted, too. They all esteem it a high honour to have been received into the band of Cathelineau\u0027s scouts. They knew that there would be danger, when they joined, and that they must be prepared to die for the cause. All would certainly be faithful; there would be no fear about that.\" \"I have not the least idea, at present, what I shall want you to do; but at any rate we shall go to Nantes, and it is there that you must meet us. We shall ride off in an hour\u0027s time. Let the others sleep till there is a general movement, then you can tell them what has happened, and that my orders are that you shall march home, at once. You can be there by tomorrow night, can you not?\" \"It will be two long marches, but we will be there, captain.\" \"We shall not be much before you. By that time we shall have determined how we shall set about the matter, and shall be able to give you instructions; which will probably be that you are to meet us, at some point we will arrange, just outside the town. Of course, you will not go in a body, but singly or in pairs; crossing the river at various points, and travelling by different roads. Enter the town as if you belonged to villages round. \"I will ask Monsieur de la Rochejaquelein to let you have another pistol, each, before you leave. Of course, you will hide your arms under your clothes. I don\u0027t know that it will be necessary to use force; of course, at first we shall try bribery. \"At any rate, you will both be most useful in obtaining information. There are very many people who know Monsieur Martin by sight, and a few who know me. Possibly some of your band may have friends in Nantes; and these, if they are of our party, would be able to ask questions, and to find out the place in which my sister is imprisoned, much better than strangers could do. \"We have heard nothing of what is passing in Nantes for many weeks and, as they have sent troops to arrest Monsieur Martin, it is possible that his father may also be arrested. If he is at liberty, he would be sure to know where my sister is imprisoned.\" The day was breaking now, and Leigh went next to the large house which had been set apart for the use of the generals. He knew Rochejaquelein\u0027s room, having been chatting with him till late, the evening before. The young count sat up in bed, as he opened the door. \"You have given me a start, Leigh,\" he said, with a smile. \"I was dreaming that the Blues had retaken the town and, when the door opened, thought that it was a party come to make me prisoner. \"Is there any bad news? You look grave.\" \"Bad news as far as Jean Martin and I are concerned. A messenger arrived, two hours ago, with the news that a party of Blues from Nantes arrived at his chateau, without being observed, as they had travelled all night and reached it at daybreak. They had no doubt been specially sent to arrest Jean but, finding that he was away, they burnt the chateau, and carried off my sister a prisoner. \"We are going to start at once. I trust that you will explain, to the other generals, the cause of our absence.\" \"I am sorry, indeed, to hear your news,\" Rochejaquelein said warmly. \"A curse upon the Blues! Why can\u0027t they content themselves with making war on men, without persecuting and massacring women? \"Certainly I will explain, to Cathelineau and the others, the cause of your absence. But what are you thinking of doing?\" \"That we have not even considered. We mean to get her out of their hands, if possible; but until we see whether she has been really taken to Nantes--of which I have little doubt--which prison she is placed in, and how it is guarded, we can form no plan. If possible, we shall bribe the jailers. If not, we will try to rescue her by force. \"I am taking my band with me. I can depend upon them, and there is no one in Nantes on whom we can rely. They will, of course, enter the town singly; and will, I am sure, give us their loyal service, should we require it.\" \"If they serve you as well as they serve the cause, you could scarce have better assistants. I would that I could go with you. It would be an adventure after my own heart, but private friendship must give way to our country\u0027s needs. I hope, Leigh, that it will not be long before we meet again, and that I may hear that you have been successful.\" Half an hour later, Leigh and Jean Martin started. The latter\u0027s first question, when Leigh returned, had been regarding the child. It was now nearly fifteen months old but, in the terrible shock caused by the news of his wife having been carried off, Jean had not thought of it till Leigh had left the room. \"The child is as nothing to me,\" he said, when Leigh had told him that the messenger had heard nothing of it. \"It would have been, some day; but so far \u0027tis as nothing compared to Patsey. It slept with the nurse, and may possibly have escaped; unless, indeed, Patsey wished to take it with her.\" \"I do not think that she would do that,\" Leigh said. \"No doubt it would have been a comfort, to have it with her; but she would have known that its chances of life would be slight, indeed, and for your sake she would have concealed it, if possible, before she was seized.\" They reached the ruins of the chateau at noon next day, having stopped for the night at Chemille, in order to rest their horses and keep them in condition for another long ride, if necessary. The outhouse had been left standing. Francois came out, on hearing the sound of the horses\u0027 hoofs. \"Thank God you are back, master!\" he said. \"It has been a terrible time.\" \"Is the child safe, or was it taken with its mother?\" Jean asked. \"He is safe, sir. Marthe saved it. When madame heard the Blues ride up, and looked out and saw their uniforms, she ran into Marthe\u0027s room and said: \"\u0027Hide the child, Marthe! Run with it downstairs, without waking it, and put it in a cupboard in the kitchen. They will never think of searching for it there. Then return to your bed again. Tell your master, when he comes back again, I have left little Louis for him.\u0027 \"I was getting up when I heard the horsemen, and guessed that it was the Blues and, without waiting a moment, dropped from my window and ran past the stable, and hid myself in the shrubbery behind it. I had scarcely done so when I heard them come round the house. \"Then there was a great knocking at the door and, a minute later, a pistol shot was fired. I heard afterwards that madame told Henri to open the door. As he did so, the officer of the Blues shot him through the head. \"For ten minutes I heard nothing more. Then someone came to the stable, took out the two horses, and then set fire to it. Looking out through the bushes, I saw the smoke coming out from two or three windows of the chateau. Then I made off as quickly as I could, got into the church, and set the bells ringing; thinking that it might frighten off the Blues, though I knew that the men were all away, and there was no chance of help. \"Soon they came riding along at full speed, and I saw madame in the middle of them. As soon as they had gone, the women all ran out from their houses. We tried our best to put out the flames, but the fire had too much hold. \"As we were doing this, I saw Marthe with the child in her arms. It had been saved well-nigh by a miracle, she said, and she told me how her mistress had run in to her. She caught up the child, and then, thinking that if they saw its clothes they would search for it, she opened the drawers, seized them all, and ran down and put them and the child into the kitchen cupboard, as her mistress had told her, then ran back to her bedroom and began to dress. \"She heard her mistress call to Henri to go down and open the door. She heard the pistol shot, and the Blues pour into the house. She hurried on her clothes and went out. They were searching all over the chateau. The officer came up to her, with a pistol in his hand. \"\u0027Where is your master?\u0027 he said. \"\u0027I do not know,\u0027 she replied. \u0027He rode away from here ten days ago, and has not been back since.\u0027 \"\u0027That is the tale your mistress tells,\u0027 he said. \"\u0027It is true, sir. You go into the village and ask any of the women there, they will tell you the same thing. I will swear on the cross that it is so.\u0027 \"He seemed very angry, but turned away from her. Presently the mistress came down, under a guard of two soldiers and, as she passed, she said: \"\u0027Goodbye, Marthe. Tell your master that I am thankful, indeed, that he was not here.\u0027 \"Then the officers told the men to set fire to the house, in a dozen places. They had all got bundles, having taken everything they thought of value. As soon as they had set fire to the curtains everywhere, and saw that the flames had got a good hold, they mounted and rode off. \"They had not searched the kitchen much, as they had only opened the closets large enough for a man to hide in and, not expecting to find anything worth taking, had not troubled themselves to look into the small ones; so Marthe had only to take the child out. Fortunately it had not awoke. When we found that it was hopeless to try and put the fire out, Marthe took the child over to the farm of Madame Rehan who, as soon as she got the news of the mistress being carried off, had sent her son away on horseback to tell you.\" \"Thank God, the child has been spared!\" Jean Martin said, reverently. \"We will go to the cure\u0027s. \"The boys will all be back tonight. Give the horses a good feed. We shall set out perhaps tonight, perhaps tomorrow morning.\" \"Ah, Monsieur Martin,\" the cure said, as they entered his house, \"this is a sad homecoming for you. If we had known that the Blues were coming, but a quarter of an hour before they arrived, we could have got madame away to a place of safety. I knew nought about it until the church bells began to ring. Just as I was about to go out, five minutes later, to learn the cause, I saw them ride past with Madame Martin in their midst. We did not know that there were any of them within twenty miles of us, and thought that there was no chance, whatever, of their coming to a little village like ours.\" \"They came, no doubt, for me,\" Jean said gloomily. \"If they had found Leigh and myself at home, they would not have taken the place so easily. He and I and the two men could have made a stout defence. I hear that there were not more than twenty of them, and I warrant that there would not have been many of them left, when the fight was over.\" \"I am sure,\" the cure said, \"that if you had been there, and the place had been defended, all the women within sound of the church bell would have come in with arms, and would have fought like men in the defence of yourself and madame; but as it was, the whole thing was such a surprise, with everyone in bed and asleep, that the enemy were off before anyone could think of what had best be done. As it was, the women from all the farms round were here, armed with hatchets or pitchforks, half an hour after the bell began to ring. Of course, in the village here we knew that it was too late to do anything, but to flock to the church and pray for the safety of our good lady.\" \"Thank you, my friend. Leigh and I are going to Nantes, to see if anything can be done to get her out of prison. Leigh\u0027s band are coming also. Of course, they will travel singly. If of no other use, they will be better able to ask questions than we. \"I am going over now to Rehan\u0027s farm, to see my boy and to thank Marthe for saving him.\" \"It was well managed, indeed,\" the priest said. \"I went over yesterday to see the child, and the nurse told me how its escape had been contrived. It was a happy thought on the part of its mother, and the woman carried it out well. \"But before you go, you must take a meal. I am sure that you must want it.\" \"I will not say no to that,\" Jean replied, \"for we have not broken our fast this morning.\" In half an hour, the cure\u0027s table was most abundantly furnished for, as soon as the news spread through the village that the seigneur had arrived, and was at the house of the priest, the women brought in little presents--a dozen eggs, a fowl, or some trout that had been caught by the boys in the stream, that morning. One or two of the women volunteered to assist the cure\u0027s servant. Three fowls were hastily plucked, cut asunder, and grilled over the fire. As soon as they were nearly ready, they were placed in front of the fire to be finished, while the trout took their place. The repast began with these, the fowls followed, and it was concluded with an omelette. \"I have not eaten such a meal, father,\" Martin said, \"since I rode away. I think, after this, I shall be able to take a more hopeful view of matters. In that respect the meal will be thrown away upon Leigh, for he always takes the brightest view of everything, and has never ceased to assure me that we are sure to manage to get my wife out of the hands of these villains, somehow; and as he has so far always succeeded in what he has attempted, I feel a good deal of faith in him. I should be as hopeful as he, if I knew that the Henriette was in the river at Nantes, and that I had to my hand a dozen stout fellows I could thoroughly rely on.\" After paying a visit to the farm, praising Marthe, and arranging that she should continue to live there, they returned to the village. \"We will go over to the chateau, Leigh, before we do anything else. I want to see how hot the ruins are.\" \"I should think that they must be pretty cool by this time, Jean. You see, it is nearly four days since it was burnt.\" \"I have no doubt that the walls will be cool enough; but there was a lot of woodwork about it. When the roof fell in it would smother the fire for a time, but it might go on smouldering, even now.\" \"But what does it matter, Jean?\" \"It matters a good deal. I have with me only a hundred francs, in paper, which is not worth above a third of its face value. I have here four thousand in gold, which I brought with me from Nantes, as soon as the troubles began. I buried it one day under the hearthstone of the kitchen, thinking it possible that the Blues might come here. The money is of the utmost importance now, for we may want it to bribe some of the jailers; and therefore I must get it, even if it delays us for a day.\" They found indeed that, as they had feared, there was still fire among the mass of debris. \"We must quench it before we can do anything, Jean. I have no doubt that the women will help.\" Francois was at once sent round and, in a short time, all the women in the place were assembled with pails. Martin and Francois worked the windlass of the well, the women carried pails of water, and Leigh threw the contents on to the smouldering mass above where he knew the kitchen fireplace must have stood. Clouds of steam rose and, from time to time, some of the women with rakes pulled off the upper layer of ashes. They worked till nightfall, by which time steam had ceased to rise. \"That will do for tonight,\" Jean said; \"we will finish the job tomorrow morning. Your band will be here by that time, and will help us to get some of these heavy beams and timbers out of the way. We can then rake the smaller stuff out, and get at the fireplace.\" At eight o\u0027clock the band arrived. Leigh went down and spoke to them, and thanked them for the two long marches they had made. He had, during the afternoon, obtained a supply of bread and wine and, after they fell out, a meal was eaten before they started for their homes, promising to be back at six in the morning, to aid in the work of clearing away the debris. Jean and Leigh spent a couple of hours in talk with the cure, and related to him the events that had passed since they had left. Then, thoroughly tired out, they retired to the room that had been prepared for them. The work that afternoon had been heavy; they had had a long ride previously, and neither had slept much the night before. The next morning the work was recommenced. During the night the fire had crept in again, from the surrounding mass; but there were plenty of hands now, and in an hour it was again extinguished. The hearthstone was soon cleared and raised, and Martin brought out a crock, in which he had placed the gold. \"Now, Leigh,\" he said, \"you had better have a talk with your boys, and arrange where they are to meet you. I should not press any of them who are unwilling to go. This is a private business, and I do not think that it would be right to urge them.\" \"Certainly not,\" Leigh agreed. \"I am quite sure that all our boys will go with us, both for Patsey\u0027s sake, and because they are furious at the chateau being burnt down; as to the others, I shall put it to them that they are perfectly free to do as they wish. They can go with us, or they can rejoin the army, just as they like. \"If they go, I think that it would be as well that they did not enter the town; but should take up their quarters in a copse, or in a deserted house, a mile or two away, so that we could call them if we wanted them. Even in a town like Nantes, forty strange boys wandering about might be noticed.\" Martin, after seeing that the workers all had refreshment, went to the cure\u0027s; as he never interfered in any way with the boys, thinking that it might lessen Leigh\u0027s authority, were he to do so. \"Now, I want to talk to you all,\" Leigh said, after they had drunk their wine and eaten their bread. \"In the first place, do I understand that all who were first with me are ready to run a considerable risk to attempt, with us, to carry off Madame Martin from the hands of the Blues, and to save her from the fate that falls upon every one that they once lay a hand upon?\" \"They are all willing, captain,\" Andre said. \"We spoke to them again, just before we came in last night, and they all said that they were willing and anxious.\" \"Good. Remember, lads, that it is not too late to draw back now.\" \"We should not dare show our face in the village again,\" Pierre said, \"if we were to hang back when there was a chance of our being of service to so good a lady.\" \"I thank you with all my heart,\" Leigh said. \"I tell you fairly that I expected such an answer. Those who have shown such courage as you have done, and have been so loyal to the promises made me when I first enrolled you, would, I felt certain, not hang back now. Now, do you draw aside for a minute or two, while I speak to the others.\" There was a movement, and the two groups stood apart. \"Your case is different from that of the others,\" he said. \"In the first place, you have not been with me so long; and secondly--and this is more important--that Madame Martin is not the wife of your seigneur, and that you owe no duty to her. The enterprise on which we are going to start does not concern the cause for which we are fighting. It is a private business, and there is no occasion whatever for you to take part in it. You are free either to choose an officer among yourselves; or to rejoin the army, find Monsieur de la Rochejaquelein, and tell him that I sent you to him in order that he might find a suitable leader for you, among the gentlemen with him. I would rather that you talked the matter over among yourselves, and came and gave me an answer, in half an hour.\" \"Will you tell us what we shall have to do, captain?\" one of them said. \"That I can hardly do, for I do not know myself. However, I think it probable that the greater portion of the band would remain outside the town. There are copses, down by the riverside, where you could wait in safety until you were wanted. Possibly you might not be wanted at all. Possibly you might be summoned to take part in so desperate an enterprise as storming one of the prisons. Of course it would be done at night, when we should have the advantage of a surprise. I can tell you no more than that. \"Now, my last word is, I shall not think any the worse of you, if you decide not to go with me.\" It wanted five minutes of the time, when two of the boys returned to where he was talking with Pierre and Andre. \"We have decided, captain. You told us, when you marched away from Saumur, that Monsieur de la Rochejaquelein had approved of your taking us, and therefore we shall feel that we are still doing our duty to the cause. You have been kind, good, and thoughtful while we have been with you. All those of our own age in the army envied us who were of Cathelineau\u0027s scouts, and regarded our position as a great honour. Even if we were willing to go back, we could not do so, and tell the others that we had left you and our comrades when you were about to undertake some perilous service. \"But we do not wish it. We all desire to remain with you, and to follow wherever you may lead us, and to die in your service, if need be.\" Leigh shook them warmly by the hand. \"Bravely said, and I thank you heartily. I am proud of my scouts, and am glad to see that my confidence in you is well founded. Call the others up.\" After thanking these also, Leigh addressed the whole of them. \"Now, I will give you your orders. You must make your way by different routes to Nantes. There are many villages on the bank where you can find a boat that will take you across. Never travel more than two together. You must all take the green ribbons off your hats, leave your belts behind, and hide your pistols. If questions are asked you, reply that you are going to get work at Nantes, where you have friends, and that you are afraid to stay in your own villages. \"I will give each of you assignats for five francs. It would not do to give you silver. With this you can pay for your ferry across the water, and buy food on the way. It were best that, both on this side of the river and the other, you travel either by by-lanes or through the fields. \"When you get near Nantes, keep close to the river, and enter the last large copse before you get there. Andre or Pierre are likely to be there first, and will be on the lookout for you. They will join me in the town and bring you orders when necessary, and will send two or three of you in, daily, to buy food for the rest. \"I can give you no orders beyond that. Now, I hope I shall meet you all, in three days\u0027 time, at your rendezvous. \"Pierre and Andre, you will, on the evening after you arrive, enter Nantes, following the river bank. You will go along to a spot where a church faces the river. Sit down on its steps and wait for us, until the clock strikes ten. If we are not there, return and come back the next evening. If we are still not there, you will know that some bad luck has befallen us; and the band will then disperse, and you will all find your way up home. \"I should advise you all to travel by night, when you have once crossed the Loire. In that way you will avoid any risk of being questioned.\" The boys then dispersed, and Leigh returned to the priest\u0027s. He and Martin had already talked over their disguises, and had agreed that those of fishermen would be the most appropriate; but until they could obtain the necessary clothes, they would go in the attire of fairly well-to-do people in a country town. \"We should only have to put on a tricolour scarf, Jean, and should look like municipal authorities.\" \"It would go against the grain to put that rag on,\" Martin said; \"but your idea is a good one, and I would dress up as a general of the Blues, or as Robespierre himself, on such an errand as we are bound on. \"We cannot do better than go to Clisson. The place is in the hands of our people, and the village authorities will not dare to ask us any questions.\" After dining with the cure, they mounted and rode to Clisson, arriving there at five o\u0027clock in the afternoon. They went to the leader of the force there, as he was a friend of Jean\u0027s. \"I will send and get you the things,\" he said, when they told him the object of their visit. \"It is just as well, if any of the people here are acting as spies for the Blues--which is likely enough--that they should not be able to give any description of you. We are all three about the same size, therefore I will go out and buy two suits. \"As to the scarves, I am more doubtful. I doubt if any shopkeeper here would admit that he had even a bit of tricolour ribbon in his possession.\" \"It will not matter about that,\" Martin said; \"and, at any rate, when we get beyond the ground held by us, we shall find no difficulty whatever in getting a couple of cockades of those colours. \"Thank you very much indeed,\" he went on. \"Here are five louis. I have no doubt that you will be able to lay them out well for us. But remember, please, that although we are all three the same height, I am some four or five inches bigger round the shoulders than Leigh; and want more room for my arms, also.\" \"I will remember,\" the other laughed. \"Just let me pass this string round you, and then round Monsieur Stansfield, and tie two knots in it; and I will also measure you round the waist and leg.\" In an hour he returned with one of his men, carrying two parcels. \"I had no difficulty in getting the clothes for your brother-in-law,\" he said, \"but I had to go to two or three shops before I could get coat and breeches wide enough for you. What do you intend to do with your horses?\" \"We shall ride into Nantes as we are, after nightfall, and shall put them up at a small inn. I know of one near the water. It is kept by a man who was at one time in my lugger, but he had his leg crushed in a storm, and had to have it taken off. He was a good sailor, so I set him up, and can rely upon him. He will get fishermen\u0027s clothes for us and, should we have to stay there any time, buy a boat and nets. We may want such a thing, badly.\" The clothes were tried on, and found to fit fairly well. In our days the short-waisted coats with their long tails, and the waistcoats extending below the waist, would be deemed laughable; but as it was then the fashion among the middle classes, and especially the Republicans, Jean saw nothing ridiculous in it, while Leigh smiled at the figures they cut. Both had bright yellow breeches and stockings, and low shoes. They waited till midnight at Clisson, and then mounted again, and by morning they were within a mile or two of a ferry, a short distance above Nantes. They stopped at a small village, and there purchased two tricolour cockades from the one shop it boasted, these forming conspicuous objects in the window, as a proof of the warm adherence of its owner to the Convention. At the little cabaret they took breakfast, and saw that the horses were fed, then they rode on to the ferry. The boat was on the opposite side, and in half an hour it crossed. Then they took their places, and were ferried over. A party of soldiers were posted at the landing place. \"You are going to Nantes, I suppose, citizens?\" the officer in command asked. \"We are. We come from Vallet, and are going to consult the commissary of the republic concerning some taxes that, as we consider, it is impossible for the town to pay, which the commissary there has imposed upon us.\" \"I should imagine that your errand is scarcely likely to meet with success,\" the officer said, with a light smile. \"I hear the same complaints at Nantes, but have not heard that any remission has been made.
