{"id":90530,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"Cassie? Is that you?\"\n Sick dismay tingled down Cassie\u0027s nerves. Then she heard her own voice saying, as she turned, \"I-I was scared ... I didn\u0027t want to bother you ...\"\n \"Oh, don\u0027t be silly. Come lie down,\" Diana said sleepily, patting the bed beside her and shutting her eyes again.\n It had worked. Cassie had gambled that Diana had just woken up that instant, and she\u0027d been right. But Cassie felt as if she were reeling as she went over to the other side of the bed and got in, facing away from Diana.\n \"No more nightmares,\" Diana murmured:\n \"No,\" Cassie whispered. She could never get up now and call Faye, but she didn\u0027t care. She was too tired of stress, of tension, of fear. And something deep inside her was glad that she hadn\u0027t been able to go through with it tonight. She shut her eyes and listened to the roaring in her own ears until she fell asleep.\n In her dream she was on a ship. The deck was lifting and dropping beneath her, and waves rose up black over the sides. Lost, lost. . . What was lost? The ship? Yes, but something else, too. Lost forever... never find it now...\n Then the dream changed. She was sitting in a bright and sunny room. Her chair was low to the ground, its spindly wood back so uncomfortable that she had to sit up straight. Her clothes were uncomfortable too; a bonnet as close-fitting as a swimming cap, and something tight around her waist that scarcely let her breathe. On her lap was a book.\n Why, it was Diana\u0027s Book of Shadows! But no, the cover was different, red leather instead of brown. As she leafed through it, she saw that the writing in the beginning was very similar, and the titles of some of the spells were the same as in Diana\u0027s.\n A Charm to Cure a Sickly Child. To Make Hens Lay. For Protection Against Fire and Water. To Hold Evil Harmless.\n To Hold Evil Harmless!\n Her eyes moved swiftly across the words after it.\n Bury the evil object in good moist loam or sand, well covered. The healing power of the Earth will battle with the poison, and if the object be not too corrupt, it will be purified.\n Of course, Cassie thought. Of course.\n The dream was ebbing. She could feel Diana\u0027s bed beneath her. But she could also hear a fading voice, calling a name. \"Jacinth! Are you in there? Jacinth!\"\n Cassie was awake.\n Diana\u0027s blue curtains were incandescent with the sunlight they held back. There were cheerful pottering noises in the room. But all Cassie could think about was the dream.\n She must have read that spell in Diana\u0027s Book of Shadows last night, absorbed it unconsciously as she was flipping through. But why remember it in such a weird way?\n It didn\u0027t matter. The problem was solved, and Cassie was so happy that she felt like hugging her pillow. Of course, of course!\n Before the skull ceremony Diana had said the skull should be buried for purification-in moist sand. Adam had found it on the island buried in sand. Right below Diana\u0027s back door was a whole beach of sand. Cassie could hear the ocean breaking on it this minute.\n The question was, could she find the exact place in the sand the skull was buried?\n Faye was in writing class. And she was furious.\n \"I waited up all night,\" she hissed, grabbing Cassie by the arm. \"What happened?\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t get it. It wasn\u0027t there.\"\n Faye\u0027s golden eyes narrowed and the long red-tipped fingers on Cassie\u0027s arm tightened. \"You\u0027re lying.\"\n \"No,\" Cassie said. She cast an agonized glance around and then whispered, \"I think I know where it is, but you have to give me time.\"\n Faye was staring at her, those strange eyes raking hers. Then she relaxed slightly and smiled. \"Of course, Cassie. All the time you need. Until Saturday.\"\n \"That may not be long enough-\"\n \"It\u0027ll just have to be, won\u0027t it?\" Faye drawled.\n \"Because after that I tell Diana.\" She let go and Cassie walked to her own desk. There was nothing else to do.\n They had a minute of silence at the beginning of class for Mr. Fogle. Cassie spent the minute staring at her entwined fingers, thinking alternately of the dark rushing thing inside the skull and Doug Henderson\u0027s tip-tilted blue-green eyes.\n At lunch there was a note taped on the glass door of the back room in the cafeteria. Outside in front, it said. Cassie turned from it and almost ran into Adam.\n He was approaching with a loaded tray, and he lifted it to stop her from knocking it all over him.\n \"Whoa,\" he said.\n Cassie flushed. But then, as they stood facing each other, she discovered a more serious problem. Adam\u0027s smile had faded, she couldn\u0027t stop flushing, and neither of them seemed to be going anywhere.\n Eyes in the cafeteria were on them. Talk about deja vu, Cassie thought. Every time I\u0027m in here I\u0027m the center of attention.\n Finally, Adam made an abortive attempt to catch her elbow, stopped himself, and gestured her forward courteously. Cassie didn\u0027t know how he did it, but Adam managed to carry off courtesy like no guy she had ever known. It seemed to come naturally to him.\n Girls looked up as they went by, some of them casting sideways glances at Adam. But these were different than the sideways glances Cassie had seen on the beach at Cape Cod. There, he\u0027d been dressed in his scruffy fishing-boat clothes, and Portia\u0027s girlfriends had averted their eyes in disdain. These glances were shy, or inviting, or hopeful. Adam just tossed an unruly strand of red hair off his forehead and smiled at them.\n Outside, the members of the Club were gathered on the steps. Even Nick was there. Cassie started toward them, and then a large shape bounded up and planted its front feet on her shoulders.\n \"Raj, get down! What are you doing?\" Adam yelled.\n A wet, warm tongue was lapping Cassie\u0027s face. She tried to fend the dog off, grabbing for the fur at the back of his neck, and ended it by hugging him.\n \"I think he\u0027s just saying \u0027hi,\u0027 \" she gasped.\n \"He\u0027s usually so good about waiting just off campus until I get out of school. I don\u0027t know why-\" Adam broke off. \"Raj, get down,\" he muttered in a changed voice. \"Now!\" he said, and snapped his fingers.\n The lapping tongue withdrew, but the German shepherd stayed by Cassie\u0027s side as she walked over to the steps. She patted the dog\u0027s head.\n \"Raj usually hates new people,\" Sean observed as Cassie and Adam sat down. \"So how come he always likes you so much?\"\n Cassie could feel Faye\u0027s mocking eyes on her and she shrugged uncomfortably, staring down into her lunch sack. Then something occurred to her: one of those witty comebacks she usually only thought of the next day.\n \"Must be my new perfume. Eau de pot roast,\" she said, and Laurel and Diana giggled. Even Suzan smirked.\n \"All right, let\u0027s get down to business,\" Diana said then. \"I brought us out here to make sure nobody\u0027s listening. Anybody have any new ideas?\"\n \"Any one of us could have done it,\" Melanie said quietly.\n \"Only some of us had any reason to,\" Adam replied.\n \"Why?\" said Laurel. \"I mean, just because Mr. Fogle was obnoxious wasn\u0027t a reason to murder him. And quit grinning like that, Doug, unless you really did do something.\"\n \"Maybe Fogle knew too much,\" Suzan said unexpectedly. Everyone turned to her, but she went on unwrapping a Hostess cupcake without looking up.\n \"So?\" said Deborah at last. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\n \"Well...\" Suzan raised china-blue eyes to look around at the group. \"Fogle always got here at the crack of dawn, didn\u0027t he? And his office is right up there, isn\u0027t it?\" She nodded, and Cassie followed her gaze to a window on the second floor of the red-brick building. Then Cassie looked down the hill, to the bottom where Kori had been found.\n There was a pause, and then Diana said, \"Oh, my God.\"\n \"What?\" Chris demanded, looking around. Deborah scowled and Laurel blinked. Faye was chuckling.\n \"She\u0027s saying he might have seen Kori\u0027s murderer,\" Adam said. \"And then whoever killed her, killed him to keep him from talking. But do we know he was here that morning?\"\n Cassie was now staring from the second-story window to the chimney that rose from the school. It had been cold the morning they found Kori dead, and the principal had a fireplace in his office. Had there been smoke rising from the chimney that morning?\n \"You know,\" she said softly to Diana, \"I think he was here.\"\n \"Then that could be it,\" Laurel said excitedly. \"And it would mean it couldn\u0027t have been one of us who killed him-because whoever killed him killed Kori, too. And none of us would have done that.\"\n Diana was looking vastly relieved, and there were nods around the Circle. A little voice inside Cassie was trying to say something, but she pushed it down.\n Nick, however, had his lip curled. \"And who besides one of us would have been able to drop an avalanche on somebody?\"\n \"Anybody with a stick or a crowbar,\" Deborah snapped. \"Those rocks on the cliff at Devil\u0027s Cove are just piled up any old way. An outsider could\u0027ve done it easy. So it\u0027s back to the question of which of them did it-if we have to ask anymore.\" There was a hunting light in her face, and Chris and Doug were looking eager.\n \"You leave Sally alone until we figure this out,\" Diana said flatly.\n \"And Jeffrey,\" Faye added throatily, with a meaningful look. Deborah glared at her, then at last dropped her eyes.\n \"Now that we\u0027ve got that solved, I have a real problem to talk about,\" Suzan said, brushing crumbs off the front of her sweater, an interesting process which Sean and the Hendersons watched avidly. \"Homecoming is in less than two weeks, and I haven\u0027t figured out who to ask yet. And I haven\u0027t even got any shoes...\"\n The meeting degenerated, and shortly after that the bell rang.\n \"Who are you going to ask to Homecoming?\" Laurel asked Cassie that afternoon. They were driving home from school with Diana and Melanie.\n \"Oh...\" Cassie was taken aback. \"I haven\u0027t thought about it. I-I\u0027ve never asked a guy to a dance in my life.\"\n \"Well, now\u0027s the time to start,\" Melanie said. \"Usually the outsiders don\u0027t ask us-they\u0027re a little scared. But you can have any guy you want; just pick him and tell him to show up.\" . \"Just like that?\"\n \"Yep,\" Laurel said cheerfully. \"Like that. Of course, Melanie and I don\u0027t usually ask guys who\u0027re together with somebody. But Faye and Suzan...\" She rolled her eyes. \"They like picking guys who\u0027re taken.\"\n \"I\u0027ve noticed,\" Cassie said. There was no question about whom Diana went to dances with. \"What about Deborah?\"\n \"Oh, Deb usually just goes stag,\" said Laurel. \"She and the Hendersons hang out, playing cards and stuff in the boiler room. And Sean just goes from girl to girl to girl; none of them like him, but they\u0027re all too scared not to dance with him. You\u0027ll see it there; it\u0027s funny.\"\n \"I probably won\u0027t see it,\" Cassie said. The idea of walking up to some guy and ordering him to escort her was simply unthinkable. Impossible, even if she was a witch. She might as well tell everybody now and let them get used to it. \"I probably won\u0027t go. I don\u0027t like dances much.\"\n \"But you have to go,\" Laurel said, dismayed, and Diana said, \"It\u0027s the most fun-really, Cassie. Look, let\u0027s go to my house right now and talk about guys you can ask.\"\n \"No, I\u0027ve got to go straight home,\" Cassie said quickly. She had to go home because she had to look for the skull. Faye\u0027s words had been ringing in the back of her mind all day, and now they drowned out Diana\u0027s voice. All the time you need-until Saturday. \"Please just drop me off at my house.\"\n In silence that was bewildered and a little hurt, Diana complied.\n All that week, Cassie looked for the skull.\n She looked on the beach where her initiation had been held, where stumps of candles and pools of melted wax could still be seen half buried in the sand. She looked on the beach below Diana\u0027s house, among the eelgrass and driftwood. She looked up and down the bluffs, walking on the dunes each afternoon and evening. It made sense that Diana would have marked the place somehow, but with what kind of mark? Any bit of flotsam or jetsam on the sand could be it.\n As each day went by she got more and more worried. She\u0027d been so sure she could find it; it was just a matter of looking. But now it seemed she\u0027d looked at every inch of beach for miles, and all she\u0027d found was sea wrack and a few old beer bottles.\n On Saturday morning she stepped out of the front door to see a bright-red car circling in the cul-de-sac a little past her grandmother\u0027s house. There was no building at the very point of the headland where the road dead-ended, but the car was circling there. As Cassie stood in the doorway, it turned and cruised slowly by her house. It was Faye\u0027s Corvette ZRI, and Faye was in it, one languid arm drooping out of the window.\n As she went by Cassie, Faye raised her hand and held up one finger, its long nail gleaming even redder than the car\u0027s paint job. Then she turned and mouthed a single word at Cassie.\n Sunset.\n She went cruising on without a backward look. Cassie stared after her.\n Cassie knew what she meant. By sunset, either Cassie brought the skull to Faye, or Faye told Diana.\n I have to find it, Cassie thought. I don\u0027t care if I have to sift through every square inch of sand from here to the mainland. I have to find it.\n But that day was just like the others. She crawled on her knees over the beach near the initiation site, getting sand inside her jeans, in her shoes. She found nothing.\n The ocean rolled and roared beside her, the smell of salt and decaying seaweed filled her nostrils. As the sun slipped farther and farther down in the west, the crescent moon over the ocean glowed brighter. Cassie was exhausted and terrified, and she was giving up hope.\n Then, as the sky was darkening, she saw the ring of stones.\n She\u0027d passed by them a dozen times before. They were bonfire stones, stained black with charcoal. But what were they doing so close to the waterline? At high tide, Cassie thought, they\u0027d be covered. She knelt beside them and touched the sand in their center.\n Moist.\n With fingers that trembled slightly, she dug there. Dug deeper and deeper until her fingertips touched something hard.\n She dug around it, feeling the curve of its shape, until she had loosened enough sand to lift it out. It was shockingly heavy and covered with a thin white cloth. Cassie didn\u0027t need to remove the cloth to know what it was.\n She felt like hugging it.\n She\u0027d done it! She\u0027d found the skull, and now she could take it to Faye....\n The feeling of triumph died inside her. Faye. Could she really take the skull to Faye?\n All the time she\u0027d been looking for it, finding it hadn\u0027t been real to her. She hadn\u0027t thought further than simply getting her hands on it.\n Now that she was actually holding it, now that the possibility was before her... she couldn\u0027t do it.\n The thought of those hooded golden eyes examining it, of those fingers with their long red nails gripping it, made Cassie feel sick. An image flitted through her mind, of a golden-eyed falcon with its talons extended. A bird of prey.\n She couldn\u0027t go through with it.\n But then what about Diana? Cassie\u0027s head bent in exhaustion, in defeat. She didn\u0027t know what to do about Diana. She didn\u0027t know how to solve anything. All she knew was that she couldn\u0027t hand the skull over to Faye.\n There was a throat-clearing sound behind her.\n \"I knew you could do it,\" Faye said in her husky voice as Cassie, still on her knees, spun around to look. \"I had complete faith in you, Cassie. And now my faith is justified.\"\n \"How did you know?\" Cassie was on her feet. \"How did you know where I was?\"\n Faye smiled. \"I told you I have friends who see a lot. One of them just brought me the news.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Cassie said, forcibly calming herself. \"You can\u0027t have it, Faye.\"\n \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong. I do have it. I\u0027m stronger than you are, Cassie,\" Faye said. And as she stood there on a little dune above Cassie, tall and stunning in black pants and a loose-knit scarlet top, Cassie knew it was true. \"I\u0027m taking the skull now. You can run to Diana if you want, but you\u0027ll be too late.\"\n Cassie stared at her a long minute, breathing quickly. Then she said, \"No. I\u0027m coming with you.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I\u0027m coming with you.\" In contrast to Faye, Cassie was small. And she was dirty and disheveled, with sand in every crease of her clothes and under her fingernails, but she was relentless. \"You said you only wanted the skull to \u0027look at it for a while.\u0027 That was the reason I agreed to get it for you. Well, now I\u0027ve found it, but I\u0027m not going to leave you alone with it. I\u0027m going with you. I want to watch.\"\n Faye\u0027s black eyebrows, curved like a raven\u0027s wings, lifted higher. \"So voyeurism\u0027s your idea of fun.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s yours-or your friends\u0027, rather,\" Cassie said.\n Faye chuckled. \"You\u0027re not such a spineless mouse after all, are you?\" she said. \"All right; come. You might find it\u0027s more fun to join in than to watch, anyway.\"\n Faye shut the bedroom door behind Cassie. Then she went and took something out of the closet. It was a comforter, not rose-patterned like the one on the bed, but red satin.\n \"My spare,\" Faye said, with an arch smile. \"For special occasions.\" She shook it out over the bed, then went around the room lighting candles that gave off pungent, heady scents. Then she opened a velvet-lined box.\n Cassie stared. Inside was a jumble of loose stones, some polished, some uncut. They were dark green and amethyst, black, sulfur-yellow, pale pink and cloudy orange.\n \"Find the red ones,\" Faye said.\n Cassie\u0027s fingers were itching to get into them anyway. She began to sort through the rainbow clutter.\n \"Those garnets are good,\" Faye said, approving some burgundy-colored stones. \"And carnelians, too, if they\u0027re not too orange. Now let me see: fire opal for passion, red jasper for stability. And one black onyx for surrendering to your shadow self.\" She smiled strangely at Cassie, who stiffened.\n Undisturbed, Faye arranged the stones in a circle on the comforter. Then she turned off the lamp and the room was lit only by the candles.\n \"Now,\" Faye said, \"for our guest.\"\n Cassie thought that was an odd way to put it, and there was a sinking in her stomach as Faye opened the backpack. She\u0027d promised herself that she would keep Faye from doing anything too terrible with the skull-but how?\n \"Just what are you planning to do with it?\" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.\n \"Just scrying,\" murmured Faye, but she wasn\u0027t paying much attention to Cassie. She was gazing down as she slowly peeled the wet, sandy white cloth away to reveal the glittering dome of the crystal skull. As Cassie watched, Faye lifted the skull up to eye level, cradling it in red-tipped fingers. Reflections of the candle flames danced in the depths of the crystal.\n \"Ah,\" said Faye. \"Hello there.\" She was gazing into the empty eyesockets as if looking at a lover. She bent forward and lightly kissed the grinning quartz teeth.\n Then she put the skull in the center of the ring of gems.\n Cassie swallowed. The sinking feeling was getting worse and worse; she felt sicker and sicker. \"Faye, shouldn\u0027t you have a ring of candles, too? What if-\"\n \"Don\u0027t be silly. Nothing\u0027s going to happen. I just want to see what this fellow\u0027s all about,\" Faye murmured.\n Cassie didn\u0027t believe it.\n \"Faye...\" She was starting to panic. This was a bad idea, this had always been a bad idea. She wasn\u0027t strong enough to stop Faye from anything. She didn\u0027t even know what Faye was doing.\n \"Faye, don\u0027t you need to prepare-\" \"Be quiet,\" Faye said sharply. She was hovering over the skull, gazing down into it, half reclining on the bed.\n It was all happening too fast. And it wasn\u0027t safe. Cassie felt sure of that now. She could feel a darkness welling up inside the skull. \"Faye, what are you doing with it?\"\n More darkness, rising up like the sea. How could Faye be this powerful, to raise it from the skull so quickly? And all by herself, without a coven to back her up?\n The star ruby at Faye\u0027s throat winked, and for the first time Cassie noticed matching gems on Faye\u0027s fingers. All these red stones-to heighten the energy of the ritual? To enhance the power of the witch-or the skull?\n \"Faye!\"\n \"Shut up!\" said Faye. She leaned farther over the skull, lips parted, her breath coming quickly. Cassie could almost see the darkness in the skull, swirling, rising like smoke.\n Don\u0027t look at it! Don\u0027t give it any more power! the voice in her head cried. Cassie stared instead at Faye, urgently.\n \"Faye, whatever you\u0027re doing-it\u0027s not what you think! It\u0027s not safe!\"\n \"Leave me alone!\"\n Swirling, rising, higher and higher. The darkness had been thin and transparent at first, but now it was thick and oily. Cassie wouldn\u0027t look at it, but she could feel it. It was almost at the top of the skull, uncoiling, wheeling.\n \"Faye, look out!\"\n The black-haired girl was directly over the skull, directly in the way of the rising dark. Cassie grabbed her, pulling at her.\n But Faye was strong. Snarling something incoherent, she tried to shake Cassie off. Cassie threw one glance at the skull. It seemed to be grinning wildly at her, the smoke corkscrewing inside it.\n \"Faye,\" she screamed, and wrenched at the other girl\u0027s shoulders.\n They both fell backward. At the same instant, out of the corner of her eye, Cassie saw the darkness break free.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-captive-the-secret-circle-2/page-4.html","bookId":2096,"book":{"id":2096,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Captive (The Secret Circle #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Secret Circle book 2: The Captive \n Lured into the most popular in-crowd imaginable, Cassie is intoxicated by her newfound strength.
