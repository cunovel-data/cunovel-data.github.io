{"id":90527,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Fire, Cassie thought. All around her she saw blazing autumn colors. The yellow-orange of sugar maple, the brilliant red of sassafras, the crimson of sumac bushes. It was as if the entire world was flaming with Faye\u0027s element. And I\u0027m trapped in the middle of it. The sick feeling in the pit of Cassie\u0027s stomach got worse with every step she took down Crowhaven Road. The yellow Victorian house at the bottom of the road looked as pretty as ever. Sunlight was striking rainbow sparks off a prism that hung in the highest tower window. A girl with long, light-brown hair called out from the porch. \"Hurry up, Cassie! You\u0027re late!\" \"Sorry,\" Cassie called back, trying to hurry when what she really wanted to do was turn around and run the other way. She had the sudden, inexplicable conviction that her private thoughts must show in her face. Laurel would take one look at her and know all about what had happened with Adam last night, and all about the bargain with Faye. But Laurel just grabbed her by the waist and hustled her inside and upstairs to Diana\u0027s bedroom. Diana was standing in front of the large walnut cabinet; Melanie was sitting on the bed. Sean was perched uneasily in the window seat, rubbing his knees with his palms. Adam was standing beside him. He looked up as Cassie came in. Cassie met those blue-gray eyes for only an instant, but it was long enough. They were the color of the ocean at its most mysterious, sunlit on the surface but with incomprehensible depths underneath. The rest of his face was the same as ever: arresting and intriguing, pride showing in the high cheekbones and determined mouth, but sensitivity and humor showing there too. His face looked different only because last night Cassie had seen those eyes midnight blue with passion, and had felt that mouth... Not by word or look or deed, she told herself fiercely, staring down at the ground because she didn\u0027t dare look up again. But her heart was pounding so hard she expected to see the front of her sweater fluttering. Oh, God, how was she ever going to be able to carry this off and keep her vow? It took an incredible amount of energy to sit down by Melanie and not look at him, to block the charismatic heat of his presence out of her mind. You\u0027d better get used to it, she told herself. Because you\u0027re going to be doing a lot of it from now on. \"Good; we\u0027re all here,\" Diana said. She went over and shut the door. \"This is a closed meeting,\" she went on, turning back to the group. \"The others weren\u0027t invited because I\u0027m not sure they have the same interests at heart as we do.\" \"That\u0027s putting it mildly,\" Laurel said under her breath. \"They\u0027re going to be upset if they find out,\" Sean said, his black eyes darting between Adam and Diana. \"Then let them be,\" Melanie said unemotionally. Her own cool gray eyes fixed on Sean and he flushed. \"This is much more important than any fit Faye can throw. We have to find out what happened to that dark energy... and now.\" \"I think I know a way,\" said Diana. Out of a white velvet pouch she took a delicate green stone on a silver chain. \"A pendulum,\" Melanie said at once. \"Yes. This is peridot,\" Diana said to Cassie. \"It\u0027s a visionary stone-right, Melanie? Usually we use clear quartz as a pendulum, but this time I think the peridot is better-more likely to pick up traces of the dark energy. We\u0027ll take it down to the place where the dark energy escaped and it\u0027ll align itself in the direction the energy went and start swinging.\" \"We hope,\" Laurel murmured. \"Well, that\u0027s the theory,\" Melanie said. Diana looked at Adam, who had been unusually quiet. \"What do you think?\" \"I think it\u0027s worth a try. It\u0027ll take a lot of mental power to back it up, though. We\u0027ll all have to concentrate-especially since we\u0027re not a full Circle.\" His voice was calm and even, and Cassie admired him for it. She kept her face turned in Diana\u0027s direction, though as a matter of fact her eyes were fixed on the walnut cabinet. Diana turned to Cassie. \"What about you?\" \"Me?\" Cassie said, startled, tearing her eyes away from the cabinet door. She hadn\u0027t expected to be asked; she didn\u0027t know anything about pendulums or peridot. To her horror, she felt her face redden. \"Yes, you. You might be new to the methods we use, but a lot of the time you have feelings about things.\" \"Oh. Well...\" Cassie tried to search her feelings, scrabbling to get beyond the guilt and terror that were uppermost. \"I think... it\u0027s a good idea,\" she said finally, knowing how lame that sounded. \"It seems fine to me.\" Melanie rolled her eyes, but Diana nodded as seriously as she had at Adam. \"All right, then, the only thing to do is try,\" she said, dropping the peridot and its silver chain into the palm of her left hand and clasping it tightly. \"Let\u0027s go.\" Cassie couldn\u0027t breathe; she was still reeling from the impact of Diana\u0027s clear green eyes, slightly darker than the peridot, but with that same delicate transparency, as if there were light shining behind them. I can\u0027t do it, she thought. She was surprised at how stark and simple everything was now that she had actually looked Diana in the eyes. I can\u0027t do it. I\u0027ll have to tell Faye-no, I\u0027ll tell Diana. That\u0027s it. I\u0027ll tell Diana myself before Faye can, and I\u0027ll make her believe me. She\u0027ll understand; Diana is so good, she\u0027ll have to understand. Everyone had gotten up. Cassie got up too, turning toward the door to hide her agitation- should I tell her right now? Ask her to stay back a minute?-when the door flew open in her face. Faye was standing in the doorway. Suzan and Deborah were behind her. The strawberry-blonde looked mean, and the biker\u0027s habitual scowl was even darker than usual. Behind them were the Henderson brothers, Chris frowning and Doug grinning in a wild way that was disturbing. \"Going somewhere without us?\" Faye said. She was speaking to Diana, but her eyes remained fixed on Cassie. \"Not now,\" Laurel muttered. Diana let out a deep breath. \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be interested,\" she said. \"We\u0027re going to trace the dark energy.\" \"Not interested? When all the rest of you are so busy? Of course, I can only speak for myself, but I\u0027m interested in everything the Circle does. What about you, Deborah?\" The biker girl\u0027s scowl changed briefly into a malicious grin. \"I\u0027m interested,\" she said. \"And what about you, Suzan?\" \"I\u0027m interested,\" Suzan chimed in. \"And what about you, Chris?\" \"I\u0027m-\" \"All right,\" Diana said. Her cheeks were flushed; Adam had come to stand at her side. \"We get the point. We\u0027re better off with a full Circle, anyway-but where\u0027s Nick?\" \"I have no idea,\" Faye said coolly. \"He\u0027s not at home.\" Diana hesitated, then shrugged. \"We\u0027ll do our best with what we have,\" she said. \"Let\u0027s go down to the garage.\" She gestured at Melanie and Laurel and they went first, elbowing past Faye\u0027s group, who looked as if they wanted to stay and argue some more. Adam took charge of Sean and got him out the door, then began herding- the Hendersons. Deborah and Suzan looked at Faye, then followed the guys. Cassie had been hanging back, hoping for the chance to speak to Diana alone. But Diana seemed to have forgotten her; she was engaged in a staredown with Faye. Finally, head high, she walked past the tall girl who was still semiblocking the doorway. \"Diana...\" Faye called. Diana didn\u0027t look back, but her shoulders tensed: she was listening. \"You\u0027re going to lose them all,\" Faye said, and she chuckled her lazy chuckle as Diana went on to the staircase. Biting her lip, Cassie stepped forward furiously. One good shove in Faye\u0027s middle, she was thinking. But Faye rounded smoothly on her, blocking the doorway completely. \"Oh, no, you don\u0027t. We need to talk,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want to talk to you.\" Faye ignored her. \"Is it in here?\" She moved quickly to the walnut cabinet and pulled at a handle, but the drawer was locked. They all were. \"Damn. But you can find out where she keeps the key. I want it as soon as possible, do you understand?\" \"Faye, you\u0027re not listening to me! I\u0027ve changed my mind. I\u0027m not going to do it after all.\" Faye, who had been prowling around the room like a panther, taking advantage of this unique opportunity to examine Diana\u0027s things, stopped in her tracks. Then she turned slowly to Cassie, and smiled. \"Oh, Cassie,\" she said. \"You really kill me.\" \"I\u0027m serious. I\u0027ve changed my mind.\" Faye just smiled at her, leaning back against the wall and shaking her head. Her heavy-lidded golden eyes were glowing with amusement, her mane of pitch-black hair fell across her shoulders as her head moved. She had never looked more beautiful-or more dangerous. \"Cassie, come here.\" Faye\u0027s voice was just slightly edged with impatience, like a teacher who\u0027s put up with a lot from a backward student. \"Let me show you something,\" Faye went on, catching Cassie\u0027s elbow and dragging her to the window. \"Now, look down there. What do you see?\" Cassie stopped fighting and looked. She saw the Club, the in-crowd at New Salem high school, the kids who awed-and terrorized- students and teachers alike. She saw them gathered in Diana\u0027s driveway, their heads gleaming in the first rays of sunset: Suzan\u0027s strawberry blond turned to red, Deborah\u0027s dark curls touched with ruby, Laurel\u0027s long, light-brown hair and Melanie\u0027s short auburn and the Henderson brothers\u0027 disheveled yellow all highlighted by the ruddy glow in the sky. And she saw Adam and Diana, standing close, Diana\u0027s silvery head drooping to Adam\u0027s shoulder. He was holding her protectively, his own hair dark as wine. Faye\u0027s voice came from behind Cassie. \"If you tell her, you\u0027ll kill her. You\u0027ll destroy her faith in everything she\u0027s ever believed in. And you\u0027ll take away the only thing she has to trust, to rely on. Is that what you want?\" \"Faye...\" Cassie seethed. \"And, incidentally, you\u0027ll get yourself banished from the Club. You know that, don\u0027t you? How do you think Melanie and Laurel are going to feel when they hear that you messed around with Diana\u0027s boyfriend? None of them will ever speak to you again, not even to make a full Circle. The coven will be destroyed too.\" Cassie\u0027s teeth were clenched. She wanted to hit Faye, but it wouldn\u0027t do any good. Because Faye was right. And Cassie thought she could stand being blackballed, being a pariah at school again; she even thought she could stand to destroy the coven. But the picture of Diana\u0027s face... It would kill Diana. By the time Faye got finished telling it her way, it would. Cassie\u0027s fantasy of confessing to Diana and having Diana understand vanished like a pricked soap bubble. \"And what I want is so reasonable,\" Faye was going on, almost crooning. \"I just want to look at the skull for a little while. I know what I\u0027m doing. You\u0027ll get it for me, won\u0027t you, Cassie? Won\u0027t you? Today?\" Cassie shut her eyes. Against her closed eyelids the light was red as fire.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-captive-the-secret-circle-2/page-1.html","bookId":2096,"book":{"id":2096,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Captive (The Secret Circle #2)","description":"Storyline: The Secret Circle book 2: The Captive Lured into the most popular in-crowd imaginable, Cassie is intoxicated by her newfound strength.
