{"id":90534,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"It was a hurricane,\" Diana said.\n It was Monday, and Diana was back in school, still a bit sniffly, but otherwise well. They were talking before American history class; it was the first chance Cassie had had to speak to Diana alone. She hadn\u0027t wanted to bring the question up in front of the others.\n \"A hurricane?\" she said now.\n Diana nodded. \"We get them every so often. That year it hit with practically no warning, and the bridge to the mainland was flooded. A lot of people got caught on the island, and a lot of people got killed.\"\n \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" Cassie said. Well, you see; there\u0027s a perfectly reasonable explanation after all, she was thinking. How could she have been so stupid as to have freaked out over this? A natural disaster explained everything. And when Cassie had asked her grandmother about the mound at the cemetery last night, the old woman had looked at her, blinking, and finally said, was there a mound at the old burying ground? If there was, it might be some sort of bunker-a place for storing ammunition in one of the old wars. Again, a simple explanation.\n Laurel and Melanie came in and took seats in front of Cassie and Diana. Cassie took a deep breath.\n \"Melanie, I went back to the cemetery yesterday to look for your crystal-but I still couldn\u0027t find it. I\u0027m sorry; I guess it\u0027s gone for good,\" she said.\n Melanie\u0027s gray eyes were thoughtful and serious. \"Cassie, I told you that night it didn\u0027t matter. The only thing I wish is that you and Adam and Nick and Deborah hadn\u0027t run off without the rest of us. It was dangerous.\"\n \"I know,\" Cassie said softly. \"But right then it didn\u0027t seem dangerous-or at least, it did, but I didn\u0027t have time to think about how dangerous it really was. I just wanted to find whatever killed Jeffrey.\" She saw Melanie and Diana trade a glance; Melanie surprised and Diana rather smug.\n Cassie felt vaguely uncomfortable. \"Did Adam tell you anything about what we were talking about out in the cemetery?\" she asked Diana. \"About Faye and Sally?\"\n Diana sobered. \"Yes. But it\u0027s all ridiculous, you know. Sally would never do anything like that, and as for Faye... well, she may be difficult at times, but she certainly isn\u0027t capable of killing anybody.\"\n Cassie opened her mouth, and found herself looking at Melanie, whose gray eyes now reflected something like head-shaking cynicism. She looked back at Diana quickly and said, \"No, I\u0027m sure you\u0027re right,\" but she wasn\u0027t. Melanie was right; Diana was too trusting, too naive. Nobody knew better than Cassie just what Faye was capable of.\n Ms. Lanning was starting class. Laurel and Melanie turned around, and Cassie opened her book and tried to keep her mind on history.\n That entire school week was strange. Jeffrey\u0027s death had done something to the outsider students; it was different than the other deaths. Kori had been a Club member, or practically, and the principal hadn\u0027t been very popular. But Jeffrey was a football hero, one of their own, a guy just about everyone liked and admired. His death upset people in a different way.\n The whispers started quietly. But by Wednesday Sally was saying openly that Faye and the Club had killed Jeffrey. Tension was building between Club members and the rest of the school. Only Diana seemed unaware of it, looking shocked when Melanie suggested that the Circle might not be welcome at Jeffrey\u0027s funeral. \"We have to go,\" she said, and they did go, except Faye.\n As for Faye... Faye spent the week quietly seething. She hadn\u0027t forgiven Suzan and Deborah for helping to get Cassie ready for the dance, she hadn\u0027t forgiven Nick for snubbing her, and she hadn\u0027t forgiven the rest of them for witnessing her humiliation. The only people she wasn\u0027t furious with were the Henderson brothers. When Jeffrey\u0027s death was mentioned, she looked hard and secretive.\n Every day Cassie expected to get a phone call with some bizarre new demand, some new blackmail. But, for the moment, Faye seemed to be leaving her alone.\n It was Friday afternoon, car-pooling home after school, that Laurel mentioned the Halloween dance.\n \"Of course you\u0027re coming, Cassie,\" she said as they dropped Cassie off at Number Twelve. \"You have to. And you\u0027ve got plenty of time, two weeks, to think of somebody to ask.\"\n Cassie walked into the house with her legs feeling weak. Another dance? She couldn\u0027t believe it.\n One thing she knew: It couldn\u0027t be anything like the last one. She wouldn\u0027t let it be. She\u0027d do what Laurel said, she\u0027d find somebody to go with-and then she\u0027d just stick with him the entire time. Somebody, anybody. Sean, maybe. Cassie winced. Well, maybe not anybody. Starved for attention as he was, Sean might end up being a problem himself. She might never get rid of him.\n No, Cassie needed some guy to be an escort and nothing else. Some guy who would absolutely not get interested in her, under any circumstances. Some guy who\u0027d be completely indifferent. . .\n A vision flashed through her mind, of mahogany eyes, rich and deep and absolutely dispassionate. Nick. Nick didn\u0027t even like girls. And Faye wouldn\u0027t care; Faye wasn\u0027t even speaking to Nick anymore. Nick would be safe-but would he ever want to go with her to a dance?\n Only one way to find out, she thought. Nick was Deborah\u0027s cousin, and lived with her parents at Number Two Crowhaven Road. The peach-colored house was run-down, and the garage was usually open, showing the car Nick was continually working on.\n Adam had said it was a \u002769 Mustang coupe, which was something special. Right at the moment, though, it looked like a skeleton up on blocks.\n When Cassie walked in late that afternoon, Nick was bent over the workbench, his dark hair shining faintly in the light of the naked bulb hanging from the rafters. He was doing something with a screwdriver to a part. \"Hi,\" Cassie said.\n Nick straightened up. He didn\u0027t look surprised to see her, but then Nick never looked surprised. He didn\u0027t look particularly happy to see her either. He was wearing a T-shirt so covered with grease stains that it was difficult to read the slogan underneath, but faintly Cassie could make out the odd words Friends don\u0027t let friends drive Chevys.\n Cassie cleared her throat. Just walk in and ask him, she\u0027d thought-but now that was proving to be impossible. After a moment or two of staring at her, waiting, Nick looked back down at the workbench.\n \"I was just walking to Diana\u0027s,\" Cassie said brightly. \"And I thought I\u0027d stop by and say hi.\" \"Hi,\" Nick said, without looking up. Cassie\u0027s mouth was dry. What had ever made her think she could ask a guy to a dance? So what if lots of guys had wanted to dance with her last time; that had probably just been a fluke. And Nick certainly hadn\u0027t been hanging around her.\n She tried to make her voice sound casual. \"So what are you doing ...\" She had meant to ask \"for the Halloween dance\" but her throat closed up and she panicked. Instead she finished in a squeak, \"... right now?\"\n \"Rebuilding the carburetor,\" Nick replied briefly.\n \"Oh,\" Cassie said. She searched her mind desperately for some other topic of conversation. \"Um...\" She picked up a little metal ball from the workbench. \"So-what\u0027s this for?\"\n \"The carburetor.\"\n \"Oh.\" Cassie looked at the little ball. \"Uh, Nick, you know, I was just wondering\"-she started to set the ball back down-\"whether you might, um, want to-oops.\"\n The ball had shot out of her sweaty fingers like a watermelon seed, landing with a ping somewhere under the workbench and disappearing. Cassie looked up, horrified, and Nick slammed down the screwdriver and swore.\n \"I\u0027m sorry-honest, Nick, I\u0027m sorry-\"\n \"What the hell did you have to touch it for? What are you doing here, anyway?\"\n \"I...\" Cassie looked at his wrathful face and the last of her courage left her. \"I\u0027m sorry, Nick,\" she gasped again, and she fled.\n Out of the garage and down the driveway. Without thinking she turned right when she got to the street, heading back for her own house. She didn\u0027t want to go to Diana\u0027s, anyway- Adam was probably there. She walked up Crowhaven Road, her cheeks still burning and her heart thumping.\n It had been a stupid idea from the beginning. Suzan was right; Nick was an iguana. He didn\u0027t have any normal human emotions. Cassie hadn\u0027t expected him to want to go to the dance with her in the first place; she\u0027d just thought maybe he wouldn\u0027t mind, because he\u0027d been nice to her in the boiler room that night. But now he\u0027d shown his true colors. She was just glad she hadn\u0027t actually asked him before she\u0027d dropped the ball-that would have been the ultimate embarrassment.\n Even as it was, though, her chest felt tight and hot and her eyes felt sore. She kept her head carefully high as she passed Melanie\u0027s house, and then Laurel\u0027s. She didn\u0027t want to see either of them.\n The sun had just set and the color was draining out of everything. It gets dark so early these days, she was thinking, when the roar of a motor caught her attention.\n It was a black Suzuki Samurai with the license plate FLIP ME. The Henderson brothers were in it, Doug driving too fast. As soon as they spotted her they pulled over and stuck their heads out the windows, shouting comments.\n \"Hey, what\u0027s a nice girl like you doing in a neighborhood like this?\" \"You wanna party, Cassie?\" \"C\u0027mon, baby, we can show you a good time!\" They were just harassing her for the fun of it, but something made Cassie look up into Doug\u0027s tilted blue-green eyes and say nervily, \"Sure.\"\n They stared at her, nonplussed. Then Chris burst into laughter.\n \"Cool; get in,\" he said, and opened the passenger side door.\n \"Wait a minute,\" Doug began, frowning, but Cassie was already getting in, Chris helping her up the high step. She didn\u0027t know what had possessed her. But she was feeling wild and irresponsible, which she guessed was the best way to be feeling when you were with the Henderson brothers.\n \"Where are we going?\" she asked as they roared off. Chris and Doug looked at each other cagily.\n \"Gonna buy some pumpkins for Halloween,\"\n Chris said.\n \"Buy pumpkins?\"\n \"Well, not buy, exactly,\" Chris temporized.\n For some reason, at this particular moment, that struck Cassie as funny. She began to giggle. Chris grinned.\n \"We\u0027re goin\u0027 down to Salem,\" he explained. \"They have the best pumpkin patches to raid. And if we get done early enough we can hide in the Witch Dungeon and scare the tourists.\"\n The Witch Dungeon? thought Cassie, but all she said was, \"Okay.\"\n The floor of the minijeep was littered with bottles, bits of pipe, rags, Dunkin\u0027 Donut bags, unraveling cassette tapes, and raunchy magazines. Chris was explaining to Cassie about how to construct a pipe bomb when they reached the pumpkin patch.\n \"Okay, now, shut up,\" Doug said. \"We\u0027ve gotta go around back.\" He turned the lights and engine off and cruised.\n The pumpkin patch was a huge fenced enclosure full of pumpkins, some piled up, some scattered across the ground. Doug stopped the Samurai just behind a large pile by the booth where you paid for the pumpkins. It was fully dark now, and the light from the enclosure didn\u0027t quite reach them.\n \"Over the fence,\" Doug mouthed, and to Cassie: \"Stay here.\" Cassie was glad he didn\u0027t want her to climb it; there was barbed wire at the top. Chris laid his jacket on it and the two boys swarmed over easily.\n Then they calmly started handing pumpkins over the fence. Chris gave them to Doug, who stood on the pile and dropped them to Cassie on the other side, motioning her to put them in the back seat of the jeep.\n What on earth do they want with all of these, anyway? Cassie wondered dizzily as she staggered back with armload after armload. Can you make a bomb out of a pumpkin?\n \"Okay,\" Doug hissed at last. \"That\u0027s enough.\" He swarmed back over the fence. Chris started to climb over too, but just at that moment there was a frenzied barking and a large black dog with wiry legs appeared.\n \"Help!\" squawked Chris. He was caught hanging over the top of the fence. The Doberman had him by the boot and was worrying it furiously, snarling. A man exploded out of the booth and began yelling at them and shaking his fist.\n \"Help! Help!\" Chris shouted. He started to giggle and then yelped, \"Ow! He\u0027s takin\u0027 my foot off! Ow! Help!\"\n Doug, his strange slanted eyes glittering wildly, rushed back to the jeep. \"Gonna kill that dog,\" he said breathlessly. \"Where\u0027s that army pistol?\"\n \"Hold on, Max! Hold him till I get my shotgun!\" the man was yelling.\n \"Ow! He\u0027s chewin\u0027 on me! It hurts, man!\" Chris bellowed.\n \"Don\u0027t kill him,\" Cassie pleaded frantically, catching Doug by the arm. All she needed was for him and the pumpkin man to start shooting at each other. Doug continued ransacking the litter on the jeep\u0027s floor. \"Don\u0027t kill the dog! We can just give him this,\" Cassie said, suddenly inspired. She snatched up a Dunkin\u0027 Donuts bag with several stale doughnuts in it. While Doug was still looking for a gun, she ran back to the fence.\n \"Here, doggy, nice doggy,\" she gasped. The dog snarled. Chris continued bellowing; the pumpkin man continued yelling. \"Good dog,\" Cassie told the Doberman desperately. \"Good boy, here, look, doughnuts, see? Want a doughnut?\" And then, surprising herself completely, she shouted, \"Come here! NOW.\"\n At the same time, she did-she didn\u0027t know what. She did... something... with her mind. She could feel it going out of her like a blast of heat. It hit the dog and the dog let go of Chris\u0027s foot, hind legs collapsing. Belly almost on the ground, it slunk over to the fence and crouched.\n Cassie felt tall and terrible. She said, \"Good dog,\" and tossed the doughnut bag over the fence. Chris was scrambling over in the other direction, almost falling on his head. The dog lay down and whined pitifully, ignoring the doughnuts.\n \"Let\u0027s go,\" Chris yelled. \"Come on, Doug! We don\u0027t need to kill anybody!\"\n Between them, he and Cassie bundled the protesting Doug into the jeep and Chris drove off. The pumpkin-seller ran after them with his shotgun, but when they reached the road he gave up the chase.\n \"Ow,\" Chris said, shaking his foot and causing the jeep to veer.\n Doug muttered to himself.\n Cassie leaned back and sighed.\n \"Okay,\" Chris said cheerfully, \"now let\u0027s go to the Witch Dungeon.\"\n The Salem Witch Dungeon Museum looked like a house from the outside. Chris and Doug seemed to know the layout well, and Cassie followed them around the house, where they slipped in a back entrance.\n Through a doorway Cassie glimpsed what seemed to be a small theater. \"That\u0027s where they do the witch trials,\" Chris said. \"You know, like a play for the tourists. Then they take \u0027em down here.\"\n A flight of narrow stairs plunged down into darkness.\n \"Why?\" Cassie said.\n \"It\u0027s the dungeon. They give \u0027em a tour. We hide in the corners and jump up and yell when they get close. Some of \u0027em practically have heart attacks,\" Doug said, with his mad grin.\n Cassie could see how that might happen. As they made their way down the stairs it got darker and darker. A dank, musty odor assaulted her nostrils and the air felt very cool.\n A narrow corridor stretched forward into the blackness, which was broken only by tiny lights at long intervals. Small cells opened out from either side of the corridor. The whole place had a heavy, underground feel to it.\n It\u0027s like the boiler room, Cassie thought. Her feet stopped moving.\n \"Come on, what\u0027s wrong?\" Doug whispered, turning around. She could barely see him.\n Chris came back to the foot of the stairs and looked into her face. \"We don\u0027t have to go in there yet,\" he said. \"We can wait here till they start to come down.\"\n Cassie nodded at him gratefully. It was bad enough standing on the edge of this terrible place. She didn\u0027t want to go in until she absolutely had to.\n \"Or ...\" Chris seemed to be engaging in some prodigious feat of thought. \"Or... we could just leave, you know.\"\n \"Leave now? Why?\" Doug demanded, running back.\n \"Because ...\" Chris stared at him. \"Because... because I say so!\"\n \"You? Who cares what you say?\" Doug returned in a whispering shout and the two of them began to scuffle.\n They\u0027re not really scary after all, Cassie thought, a little dazedly. They\u0027re more like the Lost Boys in Peter Pan. Peculiar, but sort of cute.\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" she said, to stop their fighting. \"We can stay. I\u0027ll just sit down on the stairs.\"\n Out of breath, they sat down too, Chris massaging the toe of his boot.\n Cassie leaned against the wall and shut her eyes. She could hear voices from above, someone talking about the Salem witch trials, but only snatches of the lecture got through to her. She was drained from everything that had happened today, and this dreadful place made her feel sick and fuzzy. As if she had cobwebs in her brain.\n A woman\u0027s voice was saying, \". . . the royal governor, Sir William Phips, established a special court to deal with the cases. By now there were so many accused witches...\"\n So many fake witches, Cassie thought hazily, half listening. If that woman only knew about the real witches lurking in her dungeon.\n \". . . on June tenth, the first of the convicted witches was publicly executed. Bridget Bishop was hung on Gallows Hill, just outside of Salem.. .\"\n Poor Bridget Bishop, Cassie thought. She had a sudden vision of Jeffrey\u0027s swinging feet and a wave of nausea passed over her. Probably Bridget\u0027s feet had been swinging when they hung her, too.\n \". . . by the end of September eighteen other people had been hung. Sarah Goode\u0027s last words ...\"\n Eighteen. That\u0027s a lot of swinging feet. God, I don\u0027t feel well, thought Cassie.\n \". . . and a nineteenth victim was pressed to death. Pressing was a form of Puritan torture in which a board was placed on the victim\u0027s chest, and then heavier and heavier rocks were piled on top of the board ...\"\n Ugh. Now I really don\u0027t feel well. Wonder how it feels to have rocks piled on you till you die? Guess I\u0027ll never know since that doesn\u0027t happen much today. Unless you happen to be caught in a rockslide, or something ...\n With a jerk, Cassie sat up straight, the cobwebs swept out of her brain as if by a blast of icy wind.\n Rockslide. Avalanche. Mr. Fogle, the high-school principal, had found out what it was like to have rocks piled on you till you died.\n Weird coincidence. That was all it was. But...\n Oh, my God, Cassie thought suddenly.\n She felt as if her entire body were plugged into something electric. Her thoughts were tumbling over each other.\n Rockslide. Pressed to death. Same thing, really. And hanging. The witches were hanged... just like Jeffrey Lovejoy. Oh, God, oh, God. There had to be a connection.\n \"... never know how many died in prison. In comparison to the conditions there, the swift oblivion of a broken neck may have been merciful. Our tour will now take you-\"\n Broken neck. A broken neck.\n Kori\u0027s neck had been broken.\n Cassie thought she was going to faint. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-captive-the-secret-circle-2/page-8.html","bookId":2096,"book":{"id":2096,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Captive (The Secret Circle #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Secret Circle book 2: The Captive \n Lured into the most popular in-crowd imaginable, Cassie is intoxicated by her newfound strength.
