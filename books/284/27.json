{"id":8702,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXV TOM FINDS HER MOTHER.","content":"Tom sat back in her seat and enjoyed the prospect from the windows, as the train sped along. She felt in unusually good spirits, knowing that she had put granny entirely off the track, and that there was no immediate chance of her recapture. “If I only had that money granny took from me, I’d be all right,” she said to herself. However, her board and lodging were paid at Mrs. Murphy’s for a week in advance, and that was something. About forty miles from New York a number of passengers got into the cars. The seats were mostly occupied, but the one beside Tom was untaken. A gentleman advanced up the aisle with a lady, looking about him for a seat. “Is this seat engaged?” he inquired of Tom. “No,” answered Tom. “Then you had better sit here, Rebecca,” said the 262gentleman. “I think you will have no trouble. You won’t forget where you are to go,—Mrs. Thurston’s, West Twenty-Fifth Street. I can’t recall the number, but a glance in the Directory will settle that.” “I wish you knew the number,” said the lady. “It was very careless of me to lose it, I confess. Still, I think you will have no trouble. But good-by, I must hurry out, or I shall be left.” “Good-by. Let me see you soon.” The gentleman got out, and the lady settled down into her seat, and looked about her. Finally her glance rested on her young companion. She was inclined to be social, and accordingly opened a conversation with Tom. “Are you going to New York?” she inquired. “Yes, ma’am.” “I suppose you live there?” “Yes.” “I have never been there, and know nothing at all about the city.” “It’s a big place,” remarked Tom. “Yes, I suppose so. I have always lived in the country, and I am afraid I shan’t feel at home there. 263But my sister, who is boarding with a Mrs. Thurston, who keeps a large boarding-house on West Twenty-Fifth Street, has invited me to come up and spend a few weeks, and so I have got started.” “I guess you’ll like it,” said Tom. “Do you live anywhere near West Twenty-Fifth Street?” “Not now,” said Tom. “I did live in West Sixteenth Street, but I don’t now.” “Are you travelling alone?” “Yes,” said Tom. “I suppose you live with your father and mother?” “I haven’t got any,” answered Tom, laconically. “I suppose you are well acquainted with the city?” “Yes,” said Tom. “I know it like a book.” The fact was, that Tom knew it a great deal better than a book, for her book-knowledge, as we very well know, was by no means extensive. “Do you board?” “Yes,” said Tom. “I board with Mrs. Murphy, in Mulberry Street.” 264It struck the lady that Murphy was an Irish name, but the name of the street suggested nothing to her. She judged from Tom’s appearance that she belonged to a family in comfortable circumstances. “I wish I knew the number of Mrs. Thurston’s house,” said the lady rather anxiously. “I’m so afraid I shan’t find it.” “I’ll tell you what,” said Tom, “I’ll go with you, if you want me to.” “I wish you would,” said the lady, much relieved. “It would be a great favor.” “I s’pose you won’t mind givin’ me a quarter,” added Tom, with a sharp eye to the main chance; not unreasonably, since she was penniless. “I’ll give you double that amount,” said the lady, “and thank you into the bargain. I’m not much used to travelling, and feel as helpless as a child.” “I’ll take care of you,” said Tom, confidently. “I’ll take you to Mrs. Thurston’s right side up with care.” “She talks rather singularly,” thought the lady; but Tom’s confident tone inspired her with corresponding confidence, and she enjoyed the rest of her 265journey much more than she would otherwise have done. Tom’s request for compensation did not surprise her, for she reflected that children have always a use for money. At length they reached the city, and Tom and her companion got out of the cars. “Come right along,” said Tom, taking the lady by the hand as if she were a child. “Carriage, ma’am?” asked several hackmen. “Perhaps I’d better take a carriage,” said the lady, whose name, by the way, was Mrs. Parmenter. “Just as you say,” said Tom. “I’ve got a nice carriage, ma’am. This way, please,” said a burly driver. “Look here, mister, what are you going to charge?” demanded Tom. “Where do you want to go?” “To Mrs. Thurston’s, West Twenty-Fifth street.” “Whereabouts in the street? What number?” “The lady don’t know.” “Then how am I to carry you there?” “Look into the Directory,” said Tom. “If it’s too much trouble for you, we’ll take another man.” 266The hackman made no further objections, but resolved to increase his charge to compensate for the extra trouble. But here again Tom defeated him, compelling him to agree to a price considerably less than he at first demanded. “Young lady,” said he, paying an involuntary tribute to Tom’s shrewdness, “you’re about as sharp as they make ’em.” “That’s so,” said Tom. “You’re right the first time.” Mrs. Parmenter and Tom entered the carriage, and the driver mounted his box. “I don’t see how you dared to talk to that man so,” said the lady. “I should have paid him whatever he asked.” “Then you’d have got awfully cheated,” said Tom. “I know their tricks.” “I’m sure I’m much obliged to you. I don’t know how I should have got along without you.” “I’ve always lived in the city,” said Tom; “so I’ve got my eye-teeth cut. They can’t cheat me easy.” “I’m afraid I’m selfish in taking you with me,” 267said Mrs. Parmenter. “I hope your friends won’t be alarmed at your coming home late.” “I don’t think they will,” said Tom, laughing. “You said you had no relatives living in the city?” “Not now. My granny’s just left New York. She’s travellin’ for her health,” added Tom, with a burst of merriment, at which Mrs. Parmenter was rather surprised. “Where has she gone?” “Out West. I went a little way with her, just to oblige. She was awful sorry to part with me, granny was;” and Tom laughed again in a manner that quite puzzled her companion, who mentally decided that Tom was a very odd girl indeed. “After we get to Mrs. Thurston’s,” said Mrs. Parmenter, “I’ll tell the driver to carry you home. Shall I?” Tom fancied the sensation she would produce in Mulberry Street, if she should drive up to the door of the humble tenement house in which she boarded, and declined the offer. She might have accepted, for the joke of it, but she saw that the hackman took her for 268a young lady, and she did not wish to let him discover the unfashionable locality in which she made her home. “Never mind,” said Tom. “I’d just as lieves ride in the cars.” They stopped at a drug-store, and the driver, going in, ascertained without difficulty, by an examination of the Directory, the number of Mrs. Thurston’s boarding-house. A few minutes later, he drew up in front of a very good-looking house, and, jumping from the box, opened the door. “Is this Mrs. Thurston’s?” asked Mrs. Parmenter. “Yes, ma’am; it’s the number that’s put down in the Directory.” “I’ll ring the bell and see,” said Tom. She ran up the steps, and rang a loud peal, which was quickly answered. “Is this Mrs. Thurston’s?” she asked. “Yes.” “Then here’s a lady that’s coming in,” said Tom. “It’s the right place,” she added, going back to the carriage where Mrs. Parmenter was engaged in paying the driver. 269“Now, my dear,” said Mrs. Parmenter, “I hope you’ll accept this for your kindness in guiding me.” She drew a dollar from her purse, and handed it to Tom. “Thank you,” said Tom, quite elated. “I’m glad I come with you.” Mrs. Parmenter was about to enter the house, when another lady descended the steps. It was Mrs. Lindsay, who had been recommended to this house, as the reader may remember, by the Wall Street lawyer. She no sooner saw Tom than she became excited, and grasped the balustrade for support. “Child,” she said, eagerly, “what is your name?” “Tom,” answered our heroine, surprised. “Tom?” “That’s what they call me. Jane is my real name.” “Do you know a woman named Margaret Walsh?” continued Mrs. Lindsay, her emotion increasing. “Why, that’s my granny,” said Tom, surprised. There was no more room for doubt. Mrs. Lindsay opened her arms. 270“Found at last!” she exclaimed. “My dear, dear child!” “Are you my mother?” asked Tom, in amazement. “Yes, Jenny, your own mother, never again, I hope, to be separated from you;” and Mrs. Lindsay clasped the astonished girl to her arms. “You don’t look a bit like granny,” she said, scanning the refined and beautiful features of her mother. “You mean Margaret,” said Mrs. Lindsay, with a shudder. “She is a wicked woman. It was she who stole you away from me years ago.” “I played such a trick on her,” said Tom, laughing. “She wanted to carry me off out West; but I left her, and she’s goin’ on alone.” “Come in, my darling,” said Mrs. Lindsay. “Your home is with your mother henceforth. You have much to tell me. I want to know how you have passed all these years of cruel separation.” She took Tom up to her own chamber, and drew from her the whole story. Many parts gave her pain, as Tom recounted her privations and ill-treatment; but deep thankfulness came at the end, because the child so long-lost was at last restored. 271“To-morrow I must buy you some new clothes,” said she. “Are these all you have?” “Yes,” said Tom, “they are a good deal nicer than I used to wear.” “You shall have better still. I will try to make up to you for your past privations.” “I want to go out a little while,” said Tom. “I’d like to tell Mrs. Murphy what’s happened to me. You see, I paid her for a week’s board, and she’ll wonder where I am.” “I can’t trust you out of my sight,” said Mrs. Lindsay; “but I’ll go with you if you wish it.” “Yes, I should like that.” Great was the astonishment of worthy Mrs. Murphy, when Tom came up to her stand with a handsomely dressed and stylish lady, whom she introduced as her mother. I will not attempt to repeat the ejaculations in which she indulged, nor her delight when Mrs. Lindsay bought one of her apples for Tom, and paid for it with a ten-dollar bill, refusing change. “Shure, your mother’s a rale leddy, Tom dear,” she said; “and it’s I that’s glad of it, for your sake.” Mrs. Lindsay ordered dinner for herself and Tom 272in her own room, not wishing to introduce her to her fellow-boarders until she had supplied her with a more suitable wardrobe, for Tom’s dress was by this time soiled and dirty. When the lawyer came up in the evening, his surprise was great to find the child, whom he had exhausted his legal skill to discover, already restored to her mother. He offered his sincere congratulations, and, it may here be remarked, was handsomely paid for the trouble he had taken in the matter. By the next post, at Tom’s request, a letter was sent by Mrs. Lindsay to the farmer’s wife who had sheltered Tom, enclosing the amount of money paid for the railroad ticket, and thanking her earnestly for the kindness shown to her child. Much to Tom’s delight, an extra ten dollars was enclosed as a present to James Hooper from her.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3007/83028.html","bookId":284,"book":{"id":284,"title":"Tattered Tom or The Story of a Street Arab","description":"简介： Mr. Frederic Pelham, a young gentleman very daintily dressed, with exquisitely fitting kids and highly polished boots, stood at the corner of Broadway and Chambers Streets, surveying with some dismay the dirty crossing, and speculating as to his chan...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3007","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
