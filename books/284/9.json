AT FRENCH’S HOTEL.","content":"“Clear out of here!” said a waiter, arresting Tom’s progress, and pointing to the steps by which she had descended from the sidewalk. If Tom had been alone, she would have felt bound to obey the summons; but being under the protection of Captain Barnes, who, she reflected, looked a good deal stronger than the waiter, she stood her ground. “Did you hear what I said?” demanded the waiter angrily, about to take Tom by the shoulder. “Avast there!” put in the captain, who thought it time to interfere; “is that the way you treat your customers?” “She aint no customer.” “She is going to take breakfast here, my friend, and I should like to know what you have got to say about it.” The waiter seemed taken aback by this unexpected 79championship of one whom he had supposed to be an unprotected street girl. “I didn’t know she was with you,” he stammered. “Well, you know it now. Come, child, you can sit down here.” Tom enjoyed her triumph over the waiter, and showed it in a characteristic manner, by putting her thumb to her nose. Captain Barnes sat down on one side of a table at one of the windows, and motioned Tom to sit opposite. “I don’t think you told me your name,” he said. “Tom.” “Then, Tom, let me suggest that you take off your cap. It’s usual in the best society.” “I never was there,” said Tom; but she removed her cap. This revealed a mop of hair, tangled it is true, but of a beautiful brown shade. Her black eyes sparkled from beneath, giving a bright, keen look to her face, browned by exposure to all weathers. I regret to say that the face was by no means clean. 80If it had been, and the whole expression had not been so wild and untamed, Tom would certainly have been considered pretty. As it was, probably no one would have wasted a second glance upon the little street girl. “What will you have, sir, you and the young lady?” asked the waiter, emphasizing the last word, with a grin at Tom. “What will you have, Tom?” asked the captain. “Beefsteak, cup o’ coffee, and bread-and-butter,” said Tom, glibly. Her knowledge of dishes was limited; but she had tried these and liked them, and this guided her in the selection. “Very good,” said Captain Barnes; “the same for me, with fried potatoes and an omelet.” Tom stared at this munificent order. She fixed her black eyes meditatively upon her entertainer, and wondered whether he always indulged in such a superlatively square meal. “What are you thinking about, Tom?” questioned the captain. 81“You must be awful rich,” said Tom. Captain Barnes laughed. “What makes you think so?” “It’ll cost you a lot for breakfast.” “But you know I don’t always have company to breakfast.” “Do you call me company?” “Of course I do.” “I shouldn’t think you’d want to have me eat with you.” “Why not?” “You’re a gentleman.” “And you’re a young lady. Didn’t you hear the waiter call you so?” “He was chaffin’.” “You may be a lady some time.” “’Taint likely,” said Tom. “Why not?” “I haven’t got no good clothes to wear, nor don’t know nothin’.” “Can you read?” “A little, but I don’t like to. It’s too hard work.” “Makes your head ache, eh?” 82“Yes,” said Tom, seriously. Captain Barnes looked attentively at the odd little creature opposite him. He wondered what would be her fate. She was quick, sharp, pretty, but withal an untamed Arab of the streets. The chances seemed very much against her in the warfare of life. Society seemed leagued against her, and she was likely to be at war with it. “I’ll make an effort to save her,” he thought. But of this he did not speak to Tom at present, more especially as the waiter was seen advancing with the breakfast ordered. He deposited the various dishes, some before Tom, and the remainder before the captain. Tom was not used to restaurants of the better class, and did not see the necessity of an empty plate in addition to the dish which contained the meat. Such ceremony was not in vogue at the ten-cent restaurants which she had hitherto patronized. She fixed her eyes eagerly upon the beefsteak, which emitted a very savory odor. “Pass your plate, Tom, and I will give you some meat.” 83Tom passed her plate, nothing loath, and the captain transferred to it a liberal supply of meat. Tom waited for no ceremony, but, seizing her knife, attacked the meat vigorously. “How is it?” asked her companion, amused. “Bully!” said Tom, too busy to raise her eyes from her plate. “Let me help you to a little of the omelet.” Tom extended her plate, and a portion of the omelet was placed upon it. Tom raised a little to her lips, cautiously, for it was a new dish to her, and she did not know whether she would like it. It seemed to be satisfactory, however, none being left upon her plate when she had finished eating. Not much conversation went on during the meal. Tom’s entire energies were given to disposing of the squarest meal in which she had ever indulged, and the captain’s attention was divided between his breakfast and the young waif upon whom he was bestowing perfect bliss. At length Tom’s efforts relaxed. She laid down 84her knife and fork, and heaved a sigh of exquisite enjoyment. “Well,” said the captain, “would you like some more?” “No,” said Tom, “I’m full.” “Did you enjoy your breakfast?” “Didn’t I, just?” and Tom’s tone spoke volumes. “I’m glad of that. I think it’s very good myself.” “You’re a brick!” said Tom, in a tone of grateful acknowledgment. “Thank you,” said Captain Barnes, his eyes twinkling a little; “I try to be.” “I wonder what granny would say if she knowed where I was,” soliloquized Tom, aloud. “She’d be glad you had enjoyed your breakfast.” “No, she wouldn’t. She’d be mad.” “You don’t give your grandmother a very good character. Doesn’t she like you?” “No; she hates me, and I hate her. She takes all my money, and then licks me.” “That’s unpleasant, to be sure. Then you don’t want to go back to her?” 85“Not for Joe!” said Tom, shaking her head very decidedly. “Then you expect to take care of yourself? Do you think you can?” Tom nodded confidently. “What are you going to do this morning, for instance?” “Buy some papers with the money you give me.” “What a self-reliant spirit the little chit has!” thought Captain Barnes. “I’ve known plenty of young men, who had less faith in their ability to cope with the world, and gain a livelihood, than she. Yet she has next to no clothes, and her entire capital consists of twenty-five cents. There is a lesson for the timid and despondent in her philosophy.” Tom had no idea of what was passing in the mind of her companion. If she had been able to read his thoughts, it is not likely she would have understood them. Her own thoughts had become practical. She had had a good breakfast,—thanks to the kindness of her new friend,—but for dinner she must depend upon herself. She felt that it was 86quite time to enter upon the business of the day. She put on her cap and rose to her feet. “I’m goin’,” she said, abruptly. “Where are you going?” “To buy some papers. Thank you for my breakfast.” It was probably the first time Tom ever thanked anybody for anything. I am not quite sure whether anybody before this had given her any cause for gratitude. Certainly, not granny, who had bestowed far less than she had received from the child, upon whom she had not been ashamed to be a selfish dependent. There was something, possibly, in her present companionship with a kind-hearted gentleman, something, perhaps, in her present more respectable surroundings, which had taught Tom this first lesson in good manners. She was almost surprised herself at the expression of gratitude to which she had given utterance. “Stop a minute, Tom!” said the captain. Tom had got half way to the door, but she stopped short on being called back. 87“You haven’t asked me whether I have got through with you.” Tom looked surprised. She knew of no further service in which she could make herself useful to her companion. “Haven’t you got through with me?” she asked. “Not quite. I’m not going to stop here, you know,—I am going to my sister’s.” “Where does she live?” “In Sixteenth Street.” “Do you want me to carry your carpet-bag?” asked Tom. “Well, no; I think you couldn’t manage that. But you can carry the bundle.” “All right!” said Tom. It was all one to her whether she sold papers, or carried bundles. The main thing was to earn the small amount of money necessary to defray her daily expenses. Of the two she would rather go up to Sixteenth Street; for as she had seldom found occasion to go up town, the expedition promised a little novelty. Captain Barnes paid his bill, and left the restaurant, with Tom at his heels. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3007/83010.html","bookId":284,"book":{"id":284,"title":"Tattered Tom or The Story of a Street Arab","description":"简介： Mr. Frederic Pelham, a young gentleman very daintily dressed, with exquisitely fitting kids and highly polished boots, stood at the corner of Broadway and Chambers Streets, surveying with some dismay the dirty crossing, and speculating as to his chan...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3007","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
