{"id":34840,"no":16,"title":"XIV GUILTY AND NOT GUILTY","content":"Richard Maynadier remained for two days longer at Hedgely Hall, but he never was able to get Judith alone, however much he man?uvred. After he went home, he rode over several times, unexpectedly and at unusual hours, hoping to surprise her and get his opportunity, but to no avail. She was deliberately avoiding him, he knew, and she let him know it, in the unmistakable way of a woman. It was as though she said to him: \"You want to get me off alone, Dick, but I shall not permit it.\" So much he understood. But what troubled him, was whether it stopped with that, or whether there was a qualifying phrase—an \"until I am ready,\" tacked on, and not yet disclosed. He was not unduly sanguine, and he was properly modest, but he had thought it all over—her attitude toward him, her belief in him, her dependence upon his judgment and advice—and he considered he had reasonable ground to hope that she had come to view him in another light than as a friend. Doubtless, he had been blind not to see it before—and blind, as well, to the character of his own feelings. He simply had never thought of love. Now, he was thinking of it a very great deal. [Pg 213] There was something, however, which he did not exactly fancy, and that was the liking she seemed to have developed, recently, for Parkington\u0027s society—and Parkington for hers. They were much together, would take long walks in the park and to the river, would talk for hours, while he told her stories of London and its great world. Maynadier did not know, of course, whether he ventured upon the softer side, whether he tried to strike the chord of self, in an appealing way—and Judith gave no indication. She was enjoying herself, so much was evident, and, at the same time, playing her part, admirably. Parkington was the stranger, and, since he seemed to wish to devote himself to his hostess, and his hostess was not averse, Maynadier could not find fault. He had, indeed, ventured to throw out a cautioning word, the evening he rode home, (when, just for a moment, he was alone with her) but she had only laughed, asked him if he did not trust her, and, quickly, rejoined the company. On the last evening of the house party, he came over to bid them farewell. Judith was going, on the morrow, with the Snowdens, to spend a week at Montpelier. Sir Edward Parkington, also, had been invited, and was to accompany them—as were Miss Stirling, Captain Herford and Mr. Constable. The rest were returning to their homes. He himself was departing for Annapolis, in the morning,[Pg 214] upon business of the Council, and his visit to Hedgely Hall was to be but brief. He encountered Henry Marbury, as he came through the park, and they went, on a little way, together. When they came in sight of the house, Marbury stopped. \"Maynadier,\" he said, \"I have something to tell you—can you give me a moment?\" \"Certainly, sir;\" said Maynadier, \"as many moments as you wish.\" Marbury considered a second, as though framing his words. \"It is this way,\" he said. \"You have heard of the ransom money I paid the pirates. Well, it was recovered, at the landing, by Captain Jamison, and turned over to me, unopened—at least, he thought so, and my own inspection sustained him. I counted it, the other morning, and it was correct—or, I made it so. Just as I finished, I was called out, hastily, and I left the bags on the table. I forgot them, and did not return until late in the day. Then, something told me to count it again. I did—and found about a hundred guineas missing.\" \"Some of the servants?\" said Maynadier. \"I think not—none of them would venture to enter my rooms even when the door is open, and it was closed—closed when I left it, and closed when I returned.\" \"Have you no means of identifying the coins?\" [Pg 215] \"None—I never make a list.\" \"What do you think?\" asked Maynadier. \"I do not know what to think—except, that one of the guests is the pilferer.\" \"Pilferer?\" said Maynadier. \"You are putting it very mild, if the guilty one be a guest. He is a plain thief. I cannot believe it! It must be one of the servants.\" \"None but the house servants have access to the rooms, and I trust them thoroughly; besides, the thief, to adopt your name, opened my door unbidden, and that, as I said, no servant would have ventured. We are remitted to a guest, sir.\" \"Have you any suspicions?\" \"None, thank God!\" Maynadier looked at him narrowly. \"Why do you say, \u0027thank God!\u0027\" \"Because I do not want to suspect. I would rather lose half my fortune, than that a guest, in my house, should be suspected. If I had seen him actually take the money, I should do nothing to apprehend him—nor would I permit his apprehension.\" \"Why do you say \u0027him\u0027—why do you think the thief is a man?\" asked Maynadier. \"Because I cannot think it a woman. My God! Maynadier, you know these people better than I—could you think one of the women guilty?\" Maynadier shook his head. \"No, I cannot; and neither can I think one of the men guilty. But,[Pg 216] since you will do nothing in the matter, why think about it at all? The party breaks in the morning, you will lose no more.\" \"It is not the loss that bothers me—it is the idea of having entertained a thief.\" \"Are you quite sure your first count was correct? Might not the money have been abstracted, by the pirate who carried it away? Is not that the normal explanation?\" Marbury was silent. \"Moreover, were the bags tied as you left them?\" \"Precisely—at least, I saw no difference.\" \"And when you detected the loss from the first bag, did not you examine the tying of the other?\" \"I did.\" \"And could you not have noted any difference—and evidence of haste?\" \"There was no difference, and no evidence of haste. Everything was exactly as I left it, or it seemed to be.\" \"Then it lies between your own error, a guest, or a servant. With two chances to one, in favor of the guest, I should acquit the guest—and, particularly, when it marches with your own desires.\" Marbury shook his head dubiously. \"I do not want to suspect any one, and I will not. I would not prosecute even if I were sure of the thief; I would let him know that I knew, and do nothing more.\" [Pg 217] \"In that view of it, is your course quite right to your friends—to those who are not here, as well as those who are?\" \"You mean that I turn loose a thief among them?\" \"I do.\" \"That does not bother me, Maynadier,\" said Marbury. \"I have paid my loss, I am not lamenting. I have no friends to protect, except yourself, and you I have told.\" Maynadier made no reply. He knew Marbury\u0027s way, and the uselessness of arguing the general good, and the duty one owes to society. Marbury would scorn to suspect a guest of crime, would refuse to prosecute if detected, yet he would do nothing to protect his fellow men from being victimized. It was a queer philosophy; but Marbury had been taught in a hard school, and early learned the lesson of self alone. To him, the doctrine of personal responsibility applied only to himself, his family, and his friends—further, it did not extend; and there was no obligation to society whatever. So far as he was concerned, society could look out for itself. \"I will tell you, if I observe anything,\" said Maynadier—\"that is, if you wish it.\" \"Yes, please,\" said Marbury; \"but tell no one else.\" Maynadier encountered Miss Stirling in the hallway, with Herford in attendance. She met him[Pg 218] with a glad smile, dismissed the Captain with a wave of her hand, and attached him, instead. And he suffered himself to be attached. If Judith would not have him, until it pleased her, he would, at least, entertain himself. He had no idea of making her jealous, but it was as well to take her advice, and let Miss Stirling give him some \"instruction.\" She led the way to a quiet corner of the drawing room, and, for more than an hour, he sat under fascinations such as he had never thought a woman possessed. It was the first good chance he had given her, and she utilized it to the full. And, presently, he, too, caught a bit of the infection. \"You are outdoing yourself, this evening,\" he declared. \"In what way?\" she asked, artlessly. \"In every way—in beauty.\" \"For which I am not responsible—it was given me,\" with demure modesty. \"In fascination,\" he continued. \"Which is cultivated, for what it will effect; no credit comes to me for it.\" \"All credit comes to you for it,\" he answered—\"though I had rather believe it natural—it is too spontaneous to be otherwise.\" \"Merci, monsieur,\" and, arising, swept him a curtsy. \"No, I mean it!\" he protested. [Pg 219] \"Is not fascination equivalent to coquetry?\" she asked. \"Fascination may include coquetry, it comprehends more, much more.\" \"For instance?\" \"Ease of bearing, under all circumstances.\" \"You think I have that quality.\" \"To perfection, mademoiselle, to perfection.\" \"What else?\" \"Knowledge of the world, and how to use it.\" \"And what else?\" she asked, her hand straying slowly over until it lay just short of his own. \"Knowledge of men—and their eccentricities.\" \"Which might mean I am a flirt,\" she said. He laughed softly, \"Do you want me to say you are not a flirt?\" \"No—not exactly,\" joining in the laugh; \"but there are different sorts of flirts, you know, monsieur.\" \"The expert and the inexpert?\" \"Yes—and the good and the bad, in a moral sense.\" \"I am endeavouring to praise you, mademoiselle,\" he said. \"I hope so—but,\" with a most enticing look, \"one dare not take too much for granted.\" \"You could not, take too much,\" he replied, raising his hand in a gesture. When it came down it rested on hers. She felt him start, slightly, but he let his hand[Pg 220] remain, and she, for her part, did not seem to notice. It was a soft hand, and a small, with a faint perfume about it, with delicate fingers and slender wrist.—His own still lingered, hers was not withdrawn. Lightly he pressed it—no answer, save in silence. He knew now that she was drawing him on—would not rebuke him, unless he went too far. His fingers closed over hers in an unmistakable caress. She did not reprove him; instead, she gazed across the drawing-room, a dreamy light in her eyes. \"So you are going away, to-morrow,\" he said, his voice sinking lower than usual. \"Yes,\" she replied, \"yes, to-morrow.\" \"I am sorry—very sorry—a little longer, and we might have been better friends.\" \"It is not my fault, monsieur, that we are not better—friends,\" she answered, her look still distant. \"Nor mine,\" he said. She turned her eyes upon his face, with calm sincerity. \"It is God\u0027s fault, then,\" she responded. \"So we have none to blame. But what is to hinder your coming to the Snowdens\u0027, there, we can begin afresh.\" \"Alas! I am for Annapolis in the morning,\" he said, bending down over her—\"and shall be kept there for at least a week.\" [Pg 221] \"Why go?\" she whispered. \"I have no alternative: the Governor\u0027s summons, I must obey.\" \"Always the way—duty first.\" \"You would not have me shirk duty?\" he asked. She saw it was a false step, and beat a quick retreat. \"You know I would not,\" she said. \"Did you forget, I, too, come of those who serve the King.\" She was very alluring, in her gown of brocaded lustring, ruby-colored, with white tobine stripes, trimmed with floss, the high-piled hair, the fair face, the dark, expressive eyes, the bowed mouth, the slender neck. And he was not dead to beauty, so near and so yielding. He loosed, suddenly, the little hand, and wound his arm about her waist. \"Oh, monsieur!\" she whispered, making slightly to get free. He held her closer. \"Nay,\" he said. \"Why do you fear me?\" She ceased to struggle. \"I fear—lest we be seen.\" Her yielding body, held close to his own, the perfume, the lovely face upturned, gripped his senses—for an instant, discretion fled—he bent and kissed those full red lips. And in that instant, Judith Marbury stood in the doorway, and saw it all. The next moment, she had vanished. But Miss Stirling was not so occupied with [Pg 222]Maynadier, that she had not seen—and understood. She sprang away. \"Judith Marbury!\" she exclaimed. \"Where?\" he demanded, freeing her, instantly. \"There—in the doorway! She saw you kiss me!\" \"The devil!\" he exclaimed. \"Who—Judith or I?\" she asked, na?vely. \"Myself—myself! and to set you right, I acted the devil and kissed you by force.\" \"That is very good of you—to take the blame upon yourself—but I am guilty, too; I let you do it.\" He shook his head—though he knew she spoke only the truth. Her readiness to share the blame, however, made it only the more obligatory for him to assume it all. And she, knowing Maynadier better than he imagined, watched him with a sly smile, well understanding what would be his course. \"I will explain to Miss Marbury,\" he said. \"And I am sure that she will never tell.\" She laughed softly. \"I am sure, too—I caught Sir Edward Parkington kissing her in the park yesterday, and there is no doubt that she was willing, for her arms were about his neck. Furthermore, she knows that I saw her.\" Maynadier was silent. So the world turns! And Judith was willing! and Parkington was early [Pg 223]taking the things that came his way! Vanity of vanities!... He laughed, a queer, dry laugh, that had no mirth in it, no feeling. \"Which being the case, I will have another—several others!\" he said—and crushed her to him. She lay in his arms, a moment, and gave him her lips—then, she put him firmly from her, and sat up. \"You have had enough, for this time,\" she said, blushing. He looked at her, flushed and eager. Her beauty and warmth had done their work. \"Just one more!\" he exclaimed, and took it, mightily, as his prehistoric ancestor might have done.... She straightened her hair, and brushed away the powder he had left upon her shoulder. \"Really, Mr. Maynadier, you must not,\" she protested. \"My gown will be in tatters with such handling. Where did you learn to kiss so—peremptorily?\" \"One does it, naturally, with you—and prays for more.\" \"Prays!\" she laughed. \"A robber does not pray—he takes.—No, sir! you have had sufficient. You——....\" She escaped from him, at last, and stood, rosy and panting, a little way off. \"Now, I shall have to go to my room—my gown and my hair are a sight—oh! you are wicked—wicked!\" [Pg 224]she ended—and fled, leaving behind her a vision of slender ankles and silk stockings. Maynadier looked after her with a dubious smile. \"I do not know about my being wicked,\" he muttered, \"but I do know that I am a damn fool!... Bah! they are all alike! the most modest will frivol if she but get the man, and the place, and the inclination.\" ... Presently, he laughed. \"I fancy I was unexpectedly strenuous. I warrant she had not had such a kissing, in many a day.\" He pushed his velvet-sheathed rapier back under his coat-skirt and brought the handle forward, brushed the powder from his shoulders, straightened his cravat, and, taking out his gold snuff-box, flourished a pinch to his nostrils. He would wait until she came down. Presently she came, descending slowly, her dress held with both hands. Her hair had been put to rights, her gown smoothed out. Maynadier stepped forward, and met her at the foot of the stairs. She paused, just out of reach. \"Will you promise to be well-behaved?\" she asked, tantalizingly. \"If you will promise not to tempt too far,\" he replied. \"Tempt!\" she inflected. \"I am no temptress, Mr. Maynadier.\" Gravely, he took her hand, and led her before the mirror, in the drawing room. [Pg 225] \"No temptress, think you?\" he inquired. \"No temptress!\" \"I cannot help what God has done,\" she said, and smiled in the glass, alluringly. \"Careful!—careful!\" he admonished—\"or I have visions of another tousled head-dress.\" \"Very pretty—very pretty, indeed!\" said Herford\u0027s voice behind them. \"May I come into the picture?\" Instantly, Maynadier dropped her hand and stepped back; but she, womanlike, was the nimbler witted. \"You may have a portrait of yourself, alone,\" she answered; \"this one is finished.\" He laughed superciliously. \"I hope so,\" he said; \"finished for all time.\" \"Why, finished for all time, Captain Herford?\" she inquired, a chilly note in her tone. \"If Mr. Maynadier is good enough to show me, before the glass, how becomingly I am gowned, what affair is it of yours, or of any one?\" \"I should never have guessed it!\" he returned, with affected contrition. \"Possibly not, you are very slow at times.\" \"Because,\" he went on, \"Mr. Maynadier\u0027s attention seemed to be directed entirely to your lips.\" \"What do you mean, sir?\" Maynadier demanded. She put her hand, restrainingly, on his arm. [Pg 226] \"You must not quarrel with him,\" she said. Then to Herford. \"And if it were, sir, do my lips not justify it?\" \"Marry, yes!\" he answered curtly, \"and your eyes, and your hair, and everything about you.\" \"Just what Mr. Maynadier was engaged in telling me, when you broke in. You have told me the same, a score of times; surely, Mr. Maynadier may tell me, once.\" She was trying to find out just how much Herford had witnessed. There was no occasion for Maynadier taking up the quarrel—if he had seen only what had happened since she came down from her room. Indeed, she was not particularly averse, if he had seen it all. Herford would hold his tongue, and, with a man of Maynadier\u0027s notions, it would be in her favor, likely—he would think he had done her a wrong—had put her in a false position—he would try to right it. And, if she could effect it, he would be caught. She wanted to bring him to a proposal—then, she could decide whether to return to England or to stay. If she were to stay, she knew that Maynadier was the only man who could persuade her—and, at the pinch, even his attractions might fail. Maynadier, for his part, having made a \"fool\" of himself, was prepared to accept its responsibilities, even to fighting a duel with Herford, if necessary to save Miss Stirling\u0027s good name. [Pg 227] For him, the catastrophe had been, when Judith Marbury saw—and was seen. He did not think she really cared for Parkington—the flattery of being noticed, with his air of distinction and position, had doubtless turned her head. It would be all over with, in a month or two, when he departed, and, may be, the flirtation would not last even so long.—Afterwards——? He did not know. She had something to explain, as well as he! Possibly, it would be wiser for him not to explain—to act as if none were required. A man is different from a woman: he may take what comes, if he take it skilfully; but, a woman may not take—and be caught. That was Judith\u0027s misfortune—she might have been kissed by Parkington, and a dozen others, and no one would have been the wiser. But she had been seen; and, henceforth, she was under the suspicion of every one who knew it. \"Is it going to stop with the \u0027once\u0027?\" Herford demanded. \"You will have to ask Mr. Maynadier,\" she replied, laughing. \"And he declines to express himself,\" said Maynadier, instantly. He offered his arm to her and bowed. \"Shall we resume the mirror, or shall we go outside?\" \"Outside,\" she answered, pressing his arm. \"Will Captain Herford go with us?\" holding out her hand and giving him a dazzling smile. (She[Pg 228] must take him along and be nice to him, she thought.) And she conquered, as she knew she could with him. \"You do not deserve it,\" she whispered, as she slipped her arm through his, \"but, then, you can be very nice, at times.\" He smiled, much as a child might have done, and, in an instant, his good nature returned. \"I am sorry, Maynadier,\" he said. \"I apologize to Miss Stirling and to you. I acted like a spoiled boy.\" \"If Miss Stirling pardons you, mine goes with it,\" Maynadier replied. \"You are a trifle impulsive in your judgment—sometime, it will lead you into trouble.\" \"It is the sort of impulsiveness a woman can forgive,\" Miss Stirling said, and leaning for a moment on his arm. Which completely captured Herford—as she intended it should do—and made it a matter of indifference how much he saw. And Maynadier smiled in understanding, perceiving the play and its motive,—and, leaving them together, he went in search of Miss Marbury. He found her, somewhat later, coming from the park with Mrs. Plater, Miss Tyler, Constable and Paca. To his surprise, she greeted him with the old smile, and motioned him beside her. \"She knows she is guilty, also,\" he thought, \"and suspects that Miss Stirling has told me.\" [Pg 229] \"Well, I see, sir,\" she said, as they dropped behind the others, \"that you have lost no time in securing instruction—and have made rare progress. I foretold that you would be the favorite pupil.\" He made no attempt at not comprehending—she had seen him, so, why dissemble? \"There are other favorite pupils, also, it would seem,\" he remarked, significantly. \"Sir Edward Parkington?\" she laughed. He was not prepared for such candor; he was astonished, and his expression showed it. \"I see you understand,\" he said. \"Why should you be surprised?\" she asked—\"for you were surprised, Dick, or else I cannot read your face.\" \"I was surprised—that you should admit it.\" She looked at him, puzzled. \"I am afraid I do not understand,\" she said. \"Admit it! Admit what?\" \"Sir Edward Parkington.\" Her frown deepened. \"Have you been mixing the brandy and the wine?\" He laughed, a bit scornfully. \"Why admit, and then deny?\" he asked. \"Really, Dick, either I am woefully stupid, or else you speak in riddles.\" \"You are not stupid, and neither do I speak in riddles,\" he said. \"You admitted the Parkington matter, just as I admitted the Miss Stirling matter; because it is useless to deny it.\" [Pg 230] \"I admitted the Parkington matter?\" she marvelled. \"I was not aware I admitted anything. You said there were other favorite pupils, and I asked you—but without expecting an answer—if it were Parkington.\" He shook his head. \"It will not do, Judith—the explanation is an afterthought.\" \"Dick,\" she said, \"I lose patience with you, sometimes—just what do you mean?\" \"I mean this: You saw me kiss Miss Stirling, did you not?\" She nodded—but her eyes were straight ahead. \"Well, Sir Edward Parkington kissed you, in the park—so, there is not much to choose between us.\" For a little while, she made no answer—then, she laughed, softly and musically. \"Dick!\" she said—\"Dick! do you believe it?\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"Answer me—do you believe it?\" He looked at her—eyes half closed, in contemplation—and made no reply. \"Richard Maynadier, I want to know, whether you believe that tale, or whether you do not.\" \"I do not want to believe it,\" he said, after a pause. \"Thank you! but that is not enough; any friend would naturally not want to believe. It is not what you want, but what you do believe.\" [Pg 231] \"Will you tell me it is not true?\" he asked. \"I will tell you nothing,\" she returned, \"until you answer my question.\" \"I will believe whatever you say.\" \"Then, you will be without belief on this question.\" He hesitated a bit longer. Between Miss Stirling\u0027s assertion and Judith Marbury\u0027s method of denial—for denial, he assumed it to be—it was difficult to choose. But, in his heart, he was doubting the former—her eyesight was at fault—something was at fault. It could not have been Judith—some one else, who resembled her in the moonlight. He cared, not at all, who, so long as it was not she. That Miss Stirling had deliberately lied, did not occur to him. He held woman on too high a plane—besides, the Maryland women (whom he knew) did not lie. \"For the last time, Dick,\" she said, the faintest touch of chilliness in her tones, \"do you believe that I ever kissed Sir Edward Parkington, in the park or elsewhere?\" And, now, Maynadier\u0027s answer was ready and instant. \"I do not,\" he said; \"I think I never did.\" \"You great stupid,\" she laughed. \"Of course you never did. But why was it so hard for you to say it?\" \"I do not know,\" he confessed. [Pg 232] \"Oh, yes, I think you do,\" she answered. \"It was because I had caught you—for you, sir, there can be no denial. And your forgiveness will have to bide a bit, Mr. Maynadier.\" And before he could reply, she had left him; nor did he see her, again, before he departed from Hedgely Hall. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3329/91159.html","bookId":379,"book":{"id":379,"title":"The Impostor","description":"简介： Martha Stirling came slowly down the steps into the garden, pausing for a moment, on each step, lest the Governor hear her; then she sped quickly across the lawn, and, bending over, kissed him on the cheek....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3329","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:41 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:41 AM"}}
