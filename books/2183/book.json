Softly, slyly, seductively, insistently. \n \"Come...\" \n The Disciples are being manipulated by beings older than time. Only Kernel Fleck knows that something is wrong. But he is in the grip of a creature who cares nothing for the fate of humanity. Voices are calling to him from the darkness and he\u0027s powerless to resist. \n Kernel has already been to hell and back. Now he\u0027s about to go further.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dark-calling-the-demonata-9.jpg","author":"Darren Shan","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":23,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
