{"id":99995,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The ball of light sails through the window with me. It completely envelops me, crackling over my creamy brown skin, tickling my hairless scalp, buzzing in my ears. I\u0027m warm and comfortable in its embrace. I think this is what it must be like for a baby in its mother\u0027s womb.\n I try to fight the enveloping light, to break free of its hold, but it just buckles and bulges to match my movements. Finally I settle back and conserve my energy, saving it for when I can focus it more usefully.\n I study my surroundings. Though the multicolored ball of light holds me in its grasp like fingers clutched around a coin, it\u0027s translucent. There are other lights beyond, patches and panels, a dazzling variety of colors and sizes. They fill the area around us completely. No stars, sky, or planets. A universe of lights.\n We\u0027re floating through them, sliding from one patch to another, following some sort of hidden path. I hope. Or maybe there\u0027s no path and we\u0027re lost. Perhaps this is what the lights wanted all along, to strand me in this wilderness. But I don\u0027t think so. We seem to be moving meaningfully. Or is that just wishful thinking?\n Whatever the truth, I\u0027ve never experienced anything like this before. Whenever I\u0027ve stepped through a window, I\u0027ve emerged instantly on another world. This is like traveling through an immense tunnel.\n \"Correct,\" the voice says. The ball of light can evidently read my thoughts, which is bad news-I can\u0027t spring any surprises. \"We are traveling farther than you have ever been, but we are still in your universe. Space is not as easily traversed here as in the Demonata\u0027s realm.\"\n \"Where are we going?\" I ask. Except I don\u0027t ask out loud. My mouth won\u0027t open. \"What\u0027s going on?\" I cry silently.\n \"There is no oxygen,\" the voice explains. \"You are cocooned. It is the easiest way to travel. Don\u0027t worry-it will not last long and you won\u0027t be harmed.\"\n I\u0027m not sure I trust the voice, but there\u0027s nothing I can do except lie back and accept it. \"So where are we going?\" I ask again, trying to sound casual.\n \"You will find out soon,\" the voice replies and says nothing more, leaving me to study the spectacular light show in awed, helpless silence.\n After several minutes we zone in on a massive patch of green light. As we pass through, the cocoon around me slips away and I tumble to a cracked stone floor. My mouth opens and I drag in a lungful of acidic but breathable air. Pinching my nose shut to block out the stench, I look around. I\u0027m in a domed chamber. The ball of light hangs in the air several feet away, pulsing steadily. The stones around us are throbbing in unison.\n Blanking my thoughts, desperate not to betray myself, I back away. There\u0027s an exit behind me. As I reach it, I pause, expecting the ball of light to shoot across and block my way. When nothing happens, I slip out of the chamber and scurry through a short, narrow tunnel.\n The tunnel opens out onto a plateau. I race away from the chamber, planning to put plenty of space between myself and the ball of light. But the air here is foul and my body revolts. As a stitch hits me hard, I collapse, gasping for air, lungs straining, head aching.\n After a minute of painful gasping, the stitch eases and I stand. Instead of running again, I turn slowly and study my surroundings. I\u0027m on a ruined world. The sky is a dark purple color, full of poisonous-looking clouds. Forks of lightning split the air every few seconds although I can hear no thunder. When the lightning hits the ground, the dark earth flashes and explodes in short-lived funnels of dirt, mud, and pebbles.\n Huge, bone-like pillars jut out of the scorched, pockmarked earth. At first I think they\u0027re the remains of giant demons. I\u0027ve seen plenty of sky demons in my time, massive monsters, some the size of a world. But the longer I look, the more convinced I become that these aren\u0027t bones, but rather the remains of buildings.\n Wandering slowly to the nearest pile of pillars, breathing shallowly, I find that they\u0027re made of some sort of metal. That confuses me. Demons aren\u0027t builders. Some create houses or palaces, even towns and cities, modeled after those on Earth. But they use bones, flesh, cobwebs, plants, and other organic substances to fashion their facsimiles. I\u0027ve never known a demon to utilize metal or concrete.\n The voice told me we were still in the human universe. I thought we slipped out of it when we crossed through the window, but it looks like we didn\u0027t. I don\u0027t know where I am, but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s not a demon world.\n As I move through the ash-ridden remains of what was once maybe a skyscraper, something moves in the filth nearby. Jumping backwards, I try to absorb magic from the air, but there\u0027s virtually nothing to tap into. Like Earth, this is a zone of little or no magical energy.\n The thing wriggles clear of the hard mud and debris it was nestling beneath. It looks like a giant slug, but with six small eyes, a jagged gash for a mouth, and other human-looking bits and pieces-a few fingers, a toe, a strip of flesh that might be an ear. The eyes stare at me for a moment, then the mouth opens and it thrusts itself at my face, making a gruesome, high-pitched noise.\n The slug creature strikes my chest and I fall. It\u0027s on me in a flash, slithering to my face, leaving a slimy trail. Thin fingers scratch at my chin, then a grey, cold slit clamps over my mouth and nostrils. I feel it tighten on my lips and nose, and the slug squeals with excitement as I struggle for air.\n I punch the slug but my fists make little impact, merely sink into the gooey, sticky layers of its body. Disgusting slime oozes from the slit, filling my mouth. I collapse, my lungs straining, still pushing and punching the slug, but feebly now. My strength is fading. Soon I\u0027ll be slug fodder and the beast will be able to feast on my flesh at its leisure.\n As the world starts to darken around me, the slug is abruptly ripped away. I catch a glimpse of it flying through the air, squealing frantically. It lands hard, rolls a few times, then straightens and propels itself at me again.\n Somebody steps in front of me and meets the charge of the slug. It looks like a boy, but with pale green skin. He\u0027s small but strong-he catches the slug and slams it down in a neatly executed wrestling move. While the slug writhes beneath him, the boy grabs one of the creature\u0027s fingers and bites it off with... a small mouth set in the palm of his hand!\n The slug stunned me when it attacked, but when I realize who the boy is I\u0027m shocked to the core. I stare with mounting horror and bewilderment as the slug shrieks, then quickly slips away when the boy releases it. He makes sure it isn\u0027t going to attack again, then turns to face me.\n He has the body of a young child-maybe three years old-but a head that\u0027s bigger than an adult\u0027s. Mouths in both palms, full of small, sharp teeth. No eyes-instead, balls of fire burn deeply in his empty sockets. And no hair-in its place, small slugs, much like the one he just saved me from, slide slowly around his skull.\n \"Artery!\" I moan. I have no idea how Lord Loss\u0027s familiar came to be here-he was killed a year ago-but I\u0027m certain he only saved me from the slug in order to kill me himself.\n The hell child cocks his head and frowns. \"No,\" he growls, and it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever heard him speak. His green flesh ripples and the color fades. His head shrinks and the slugs burrow into his scalp, then turn into hair. The fire in his empty sockets dies away and eyes sprout to fill them. His large mouth tightens a couple of notches and his sharp teeth soften into a more human-like shape. The mouths in his palms disappear, flesh closing over them.\n \"No,\" he says again, and this time his voice is softer. \"Not Artery.\" He glances at his skin-pale, like Mom\u0027s-and smiles. Almost no trace of the monster remains. I\u0027m gazing at what looks like an ordinary boy. And he\u0027s every bit as familiar as the green-skinned demon.\n \"I\u0027m Art,\" he says, then steps forward and stick out a small, delicate hand. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-calling-the-demonata-9/page-6.html","bookId":2183,"book":{"id":2183,"title":"Dark Calling (The Demonata #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Dark Calling (The Demonata #9) \n I know it\u0027s ridiculous.
