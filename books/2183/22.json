{"id":100011,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Ranks of monsters surround us, stretching far into the distance. This must be the world from which the Demonata are plotting their invasion of Earth, the base from which they send troops when they open windows to our world. We knew an army was massing but we never dared confront it. Beranabus was a reckless fighter but he wasn\u0027t crazy. He knew we couldn\u0027t hope to face this many demons and walk away alive.\n The demons have backed off from the disintegrating mammoth of the Shadow. They\u0027re watching it with alarm, chittering and bellowing, not sure what\u0027s going on. It\u0027s their leader. Death drew them together, promising them control of the universe and eternal life. Now it\u0027s falling to pieces like a punctured zeppelin. They don\u0027t know what to do.\n \"There!\" shrieks an all-too-recognizable voice. Pushing myself to my feet, I spy her near the fore of the demons to my left-Nadia Moore, AKA Juni Swan. She\u0027s by the side of her eight-armed master, Lord Loss. Both are staring at us with a mix of hatred and uncertainty.\n I look around slowly, showing no signs of panic in case I incite the Demonata. Grubbs and Bec are nearby. Grubbs has also seen Juni and Lord Loss. He\u0027s taking deep breaths, preparing for battle. Bec is fixing her arm and doesn\u0027t seem to be aware of the trouble we\u0027re in. Dervish is using magic to revive Meera, glancing around anxiously as he fans her back to life. The ten surviving werewolves have gathered in a circle behind Grubbs, growling softly as they eyeball the demons. And a little further over, hopping around, unaware that we\u0027ve escaped the stomach of the Shadow, is Kirilli Kovacs.\n \"Grubbs,\" I hiss. \"Any ideas?\"\n \"Can you open a window?\" he mutters, cracking his knuckles.\n \"I\u0027ve already started,\" I whisper, nudging patches of light into place with deft flicks of my fingers, not wanting to alert our enemies to the fact that I\u0027m at work. \"It\u0027ll take a few minutes. Can you cover me?\"\n \"I\u0027ll give it a good shot,\" he growls, then bellows at Lord Loss. \"Where\u0027s your mighty leader now? Death offered you the universe and immortality. Hah!\"\n Bec finishes setting her arm and calmly walks over to Grubbs. She stands behind him, back to back. Dervish and a woozy Meera shuffle up beside them. When Kirilli hears Grubbs, he stops dancing and stares around. The werewolves haven\u0027t moved, awaiting Grubbs\u0027s command.\n \"Very commendable, Grubitsch,\" Lord Loss says. His voice silences the mutterings and snarls of the other demons. He drifts to the front of the army, Juni by his side. When he\u0027s in the open, he looks at each of us in turn and smiles. \"But Death cannot be destroyed. You have merely inconvenienced it. A valiant victory, but you have only won a battle, not the war. You know that. We all know that.\" He addresses the last cry to the army of demons, raising his voice, and they roar back encouragingly.\n \"This feels like a reunion,\" Lord Loss says, smiling sadly, the snakes writhing in the hole where his heart should be, blood oozing from the many cracks in his pale red flesh. \"So many familiar faces. Grubitsch, Dervish, Cornelius, even little Bec, back from the dead and as tenacious as ever.\"\n \"Master,\" Juni murmurs, nodding sharply at me.\n \"I am aware of Cornelius\u0027s efforts,\" Lord Loss chuckles. \"Don\u0027t worry, sweet Swan, he will not have time to open a window. I let him get this far in order to fan the flames of hope in their hearts. Now that those flames are flickering nicely\"-his red eyes flash dangerously-\"it is time to quench them.\" He shouts at the millions of demons, \"Attack!\"\n With a volley of deafening screams and howls, the army surges forward and smashes to the ground around us, a living wave of chaos, barbarism, and death.\n We\u0027d perish in seconds without the power of the Kah-Gash. But as soon as Lord Loss roars, Grubbs grabs Bec, leaps to my side, and wraps an arm around me. Unifying our magic, he draws from the power in the air and erects a hasty but sturdy barrier around us. Instead of driving us to the floor and ripping us to shreds, the demons deflect off the shield.\n I work on the window as the demons lash and claw at the barrier. It covers all of us except Kirilli, who was too far away and has been cut off, swamped by the army of demonic warriors. It\u0027s a powerful shield, impervious to physical assault. If the demons continue to hurl themselves at it, they won\u0027t inflict any damage and we\u0027ll be out of here in another couple of-\n \"Stand aside!\" Lord Loss yells, blasting his way through a pack of gibbering beasts. He studies the barrier and sneers, then howls a phrase of magic. Energy crackles in all eight of his hands. He lets it build, then directs it at the barrier, a stream of sizzling, purple power. Lord Loss is a demon master, far superior to any human in the ways of magic. Nothing should be able to stand against him. But we\u0027re the Kah-Gash and I sense within seconds that we\u0027re stronger than our foe. I laugh confidently. We\u0027re going to walk out of this without even a scratch. I can\u0027t wait to see the look on his face when...\n Juni lays a hand on Lord Loss\u0027s lumpy flesh. She\u0027s changed a lot since I last saw her and has become a mutated, flesh-dripping, impossibly ugly beast. Her eyes flare with shocking madness and naked hate. I remember when, as Nadia Moore, she saved my life. She\u0027d committed herself to Lord Loss by that stage, but there was still room in her heart for human feelings.\n Not anymore. She\u0027s become that which she once fought, every bit as heartless as a true child of the Demonata. She screeches vilely and unleashes a burst of magic at the barrier. At her cry, demons huddle around the pair and link with them, adding their energy to hers and Lord Loss\u0027s, focusing their combined forces on the shield.\n \"Grubbs!\" Bec pants, feeling the barrier give. \"We need more power.\"\n \"I can\u0027t,\" he gasps, sweating as we all are, buckling under the strain. \"This is as far... as I dare unleash it. If I give it more freedom... I won\u0027t be able to control it. Anything could... happen.\"\n I don\u0027t understand what he\u0027s saying. He must be insane. The barrier will break and they\u0027ll be on us in seconds. We have to throw everything we have at them or else we\u0027re doomed.\n Then I remember when we last gave the Kah-Gash absolute freedom. It drove the universes back in time. If we could count on it working in our favor again, there\u0027d be no need to worry. But we don\u0027t know what it will do if we set it loose a second time. Maybe it would give us the strength to defeat the demons-or maybe it would wipe out our universe and hand victory to the Demonata. We dare not play that card unless all else is lost. Our situation is desperate but not hopeless, and until that changes, Grubbs is right to hold back.\n \"We have to fight,\" he roars. \"Are you ready?\" I nod weakly. \"Bec?\"\n \"Go for it,\" she growls.\n With a battle-hungry cry, Grubbs explodes the barrier. A wall of energy spreads like a ripple from a nuclear explosion, flattening the demons closest to us. For a few seconds we\u0027re standing at the center of a clear circle, confusion reigning all around. Then the demons farther back recover, bellow brutally, and push forward, clambering over the bodies of the fallen, to surround and enclose us.\n The real fight begins.\n It\u0027s wilder than any battle I\u0027ve ever been involved in. I\u0027ve laughed in the face of overwhelming odds before, but nobody\u0027s laughing now. There are too many of them, demons of every rank, from familiars up to masters like Lord Loss. All they share is a total hatred of us and a determination to strip our flesh from our bones.\n We strike without pause, using bolts and fireballs of magic. Hundreds perish within seconds, but still they press on, thousands of fresh monsters to replace each that falls.\n I try to stay in touch with Bec and Grubbs, but we\u0027re forced apart. Grubbs is dragged away by several demons at least five times his size. A winged beast snatches Bec from the ground and shoots into the air with her.\n I go down under the feet of dozens of hard-shelled demons. Claws slash, fangs and pincers snap. I feel cuts open down my legs and arms, across my stomach and chest. I ignore the pain, use magic to numb the worst of it, and with a great effort thrust off the demons. Yelling, I stagger to my feet, then collapse again beneath a dinosaur-shaped beast.\n Fangs lock around my throat and tighten. I turn the flesh of my neck to steel but the fangs continue to grind together. This is the end. There\u0027s nothing I can do. Some wounds are fatal, no matter how magical you are. Once my throat\u0027s been crushed, I\u0027m as dead as-\n A silver, purple-tipped spike pokes sharply through the center of the dinosaur\u0027s head. It squeals, then falls aside. A panting Dervish pulls me to my feet. The spikes on his head have tripled in length and writhe like snakes, independent of one another, jabbing at the demons around us, driving them back.\n \"How much longer will it take you to open that freakin\u0027 window?\" he roars.\n I look for the patches of light. They\u0027re twenty feet away, drifting apart. With a curse, I summon them, pat the stray patches into place, and start adding new lights to the pack.\n \"How long?\" Dervish screams again, blood flowing from a chunk that\u0027s been bitten out of the left side of his chest-I see snapped white bones poking through the streams of red.\n \"Maybe a minute,\" I gasp, hands blurring.\n I glance around as I\u0027m putting the window together. Grubbs is back on his feet, supported by his retinue of werewolves, who\u0027ve torn into the demons around him, attacking rabidly, tearing strips out of their foes. Bec is still fighting with the winged demon and has forced it towards the ground. Meera\u0027s close by, doggedly working her way back to us. Her left arm\u0027s been severed at the shoulder. Half her face is a clawed-up, blood-soaked mess-her beauty\u0027s been spoiled forever. But more worrying than that are the guts dangling from a hole in her stomach, and the small demon wrapped around her waist, tugging at the intestines, reeling them out like a cat unraveling a ball of string.\n \"Meera!\" I scream, desperate to help but needing to stay focused on the window. It\u0027s our only hope of escape. If I abandon it, we\u0027re all doomed.\n Dervish has spotted Meera too. He begins to dart to her rescue, then swears and drives back a multi-eyed monster that was about to snap off my hands. He has to stand guard. I can\u0027t protect myself while I\u0027m working on the window. He\u0027s tied to his post, as I am. He weeps with frustration as he fights off the hordes clustered around us, muttering Meera\u0027s name over and over.\n The demon working on Meera\u0027s guts stick its head into the hole in her stomach. It\u0027s giggling sickeningly, like a child tucking into a box of treats. But then its head explodes and it topples to the ground. A figure breaks through the demons around Meera and hauls her forward, towards us. I think my eyes are playing tricks, but when I blink and see the same thing, I realize I\u0027m not dreaming.\n Kirilli Kovacs is plowing through the ranks of demons. One of his hands has turned into a steel scythe and he\u0027s mowing down all who come too close. He\u0027s the one who rescued Meera.\n \"Kovacs, you lunatic!\" Dervish yells with delight. \"You\u0027re supposed to be a coward!\"\n \"I am!\" Kirilli screeches.\n \"Then what the hell are you doing?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know! I think I\u0027m saving the day! It feels-\"\n A demon sweeps Kirilli\u0027s legs from under him. He flies into the air with a yelp, then is knocked sideways by a bellowing, half-human beast intent on getting her hands on us before any of the others finish us off. Juni Swan is back in the thick of the action.\n She angles for Dervish, dripping flesh as she charges, swiping demons out of her way, teeth bared, eyes rolling madly. With a welcoming grunt, Dervish sets his feet firmly and snarls, losing interest in all the other monsters, forgetting his duty to protect me. As Juni rushes him, he grabs hold of her arms and swings her around like an adult whirling a baby. Juni spits acid into his face. He neutralizes it swiftly but not before a wide swathe of his flesh bubbles away. The pair fall to the ground, wrestling savagely, stabbing, biting, punching, and spitting, each hellbent on murdering the other.\n The window\u0027s almost fully formed, but there\u0027s no one to watch my back now. Several hound-like demons press tight around me, snapping at my face, digging channels in my flesh with their jagged claws. \"Grubbs! Bec!\" I scream, turning from the window to drive back the demons. \"I need help!\"\n Grubbs roars at his werewolves. Slipping free of the giants, they struggle towards me, blasting and chewing a path through the packed ranks of monsters.\n In the air, Bec\u0027s seen off the challenge of the winged demon, but Lord Loss has hit the scene. The pair tumble and roll around overhead. Half his arms are holding her rigidly against his rancid flesh. The other half are lashing her, pulling her hair, trying to gouge out her eyes, digging into her soft flesh.\n Meera\u0027s in bad shape, but she shoves fistfuls of guts back into the hole in her stomach and dives to Dervish\u0027s rescue, pulls Juni Swan off of him, and scratches at the traitor\u0027s eyes. Juni screeches and tries to knock her away but Meera\u0027s stronger than she looks, and she loves Dervish as much as Juni hates him. Grabbing hold of Juni\u0027s bloated, rotten head, she jerks her hard and they spin away. Dervish tries to follow but gets tangled up with another demon.\n Grubbs and the few surviving werewolves make it to my side. They\u0027re all badly wounded but they fight as viciously as ever. As they form a half-wall around me, Grubbs yells at me to finish the window and I hurry to obey. The fingers of my left hand have been crushed but I can still manipulate the patches. Sobbing with pain and fear, I slot one after another into place, praying for the lights to gel and the window to open before it\u0027s too late.\n Juni\u0027s laughing. She\u0027s got both hands inside the hole in Meera\u0027s stomach and is forcing them up through the layers of guts that still remain, seeking to crush lungs, the heart... whatever she can find.\n \"Meera!\" Dervish howls, trying to force his way through to her but failing.\n Meera smiles painfully. She\u0027s got her arms wrapped around Juni, holding tight. As Juni tears at Meera\u0027s insides, the Disciple catches our gaze and winks wearily. \"No... Shadow,\" she wheezes.\n \"What\u0027s that?\" Juni roars.\n \"No... Shadow,\" Meera repeats. \"When I die... I\u0027m finished... and so... are you.\"\n Juni\u0027s face freezes. She catches on to Meera\u0027s plan a second too late. Her eyes widen with alarm as she tries to detach herself and dart to safety. But before she can, Meera explodes. She must have been working on the ball of energy since she realized she was beyond help. It bursts from her in a blazing flash of light, shatters her bones, incinerates her flesh-and rips through the mutated, twisted form that Juni built for herself when Death restored her soul to life.\n Juni\u0027s final howl is lost in the noise of the explosion. She\u0027s torn to shreds along with Meera, and both women fall to the ground in ragged, bloody, lifeless chunks, their souls freed or lost, however you choose to look at it. Meera has gone to the great beyond, which is a sickening blow. But I experience a burst of joy as well as sorrow, because Juni Swan has perished too, and this time no power in the universe can bring the vindictive harpy back. We\u0027re rid of her at last! \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-calling-the-demonata-9/page-22.html","bookId":2183,"book":{"id":2183,"title":"Dark Calling (The Demonata #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Dark Calling (The Demonata #9) \n I know it\u0027s ridiculous.
