{"id":99992,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I can\u0027t tell the others about the lights, the whispers, or my suspicion that we are being used. I want to, but whenever I try to share my fears, my lips seize up. I\u0027m unable to speak, or else everyday babble spills out and we end up talking about something else. I\u0027ve tried writing, scribbling a warning in the sand of the oasis, but my fingers clench and turn against me. When we first stepped through the window, I thought I might have imagined the whispers or the influence they\u0027re exerting over us. Now I\u0027m sure I called it right. The lights did-do-control us. They must have planted a hidden command inside my brain that makes me clam up whenever I try to share my misgivings. While I struggle to break through the spell, the others argue about what to do next. Beranabus wants to hunt the Shadow, pick up where we left off. Dervish is against that. He\u0027s determined to go after Juni, to settle old scores. I stay out of the arguments for a couple of days. But when Dervish is pressing his claim for the umpteenth time, trying to sway Beranabus by saying we might be able to torture Juni to find out information about the Shadow, the small, ever-changing lights pulse and the air hums with whispers only I can hear. \"We can\u0027t go after Lord Loss directly-he\u0027s too powerful,\" I find myself telling Beranabus, and although I know these aren\u0027t my words, that I\u0027m being used like a puppet, I can\u0027t stop. \"But we can target Juni. Lord Loss didn\u0027t show himself at the hospital but Juni was acting on his behalf. She might have been part of the group in Carcery Vale too. If more assaults on the Disciples are planned, she\u0027ll possibly act as the go-between again, conveying Lord Loss\u0027s orders to their allies. If we can trap her, we can find out what she knows about the Shadow.\" Beranabus thinks that makes sense-or the lights make him think it-so he tells me to focus on Juni, track her movements, and let him know when she slips out of Lord Loss\u0027s realm. I want to scream and tell them we\u0027re being toyed with, but my lips gum up. I throw everything I have at the spell, to no avail. In the end I do as Beranabus bids. I retire to one of the fake trees-the oasis is dotted with trees made of bones and scraps of flesh-and sit in the shade, glumly training my thoughts on Juni Swan. As days pass, the others recuperate. Beranabus and Bec fashioned new legs for Sharmila out of the bones and skin of the trees when we arrived, and she adapts to them smoothly. Bec has worked a lot with Dervish, drawing on her healing powers, doing what she can for his faltering heart. Neither he nor Sharmila can live on Earth again, but as long as they stay in this universe of magic they can function almost normally. The four of them pass a lot of the time dueling, sharpening their reflexes, testing their skills. Magic is all about trial and error. Even after thousands of years, Beranabus is still discovering new aspects of himself, depending on what\u0027s thrown at him. I\u0027d like to join them, but I\u0027ve been given a task and Beranabus doesn\u0027t take it kindly when one of his assistants disobeys a direct order. So I keep to myself, studying the lights and focusing on Juni Swan and her master. It\u0027s difficult because of the whispers. The murmurs come regularly while I\u0027m concentrating, not as strongly as at the hospital, but distracting nonetheless. I can\u0027t stop thinking about the spell they\u0027ve woven. Is it the work of the Shadow? Unlikely-if the creature could exert such influence, it would turn us against one another. The Kah-Gash? A weapon that can destroy universes and distort the laws of time would have no difficulty bending a few humans to its will. But the Kah-Gash would surely have wanted me, Grubbs, and Bec together, to unite so it could be reassembled. If not the Shadow or the Kah-Gash, who can be controlling the lights? Are they self-conscious, some new life-form? Or maybe I\u0027m imagining them. I\u0027ve doubted my sanity in the past. Maybe this time I\u0027ve cracked for real. Finally, after a week of self-torment and doubt, I sense Juni opening a window and leaving Lord Loss\u0027s world. \"She\u0027s moving,\" I tell the others, disrupting their latest duel. They crowd around me. \"Where did she go?\" Beranabus asks. \"Earth,\" I say after a brief pause to confirm her location. \"And Lord Loss?\" \"He stayed in his own realm.\" \"Can you tell where exactly she is?\" Dervish asks. \"No. I should be able to, but I can\u0027t place it.\" That worries me more than I reveal. \"Is she close to Grubbs?\" Dervish presses. I do a quick scan and shake my head. \"Well?\" Sharmila asks Beranabus. \"Kernel and I will investigate,\" he says. \"The rest of you stay here.\" \"Nuts to that,\" Dervish huffs. \"Don\u0027t forget about your heart,\" Beranabus says. \"Or Sharmila\u0027s legs. You\u0027re a pair of wrecks on that world. Let us check the situation and report back. We won\u0027t engage her if we can avoid it.\" \"What about me?\" Bec asks. \"I can survive there.\" \"Aye, but I\u0027m asking you to wait. Please. Until we know more about what we\u0027re walking into.\" I\u0027d like to know more about it too before I cross. But I\u0027ve lived with Beranabus long enough to know he doesn\u0027t hold much faith in the philosophy of look-before-you-leap. Except for his edgy pursuit of the Shadow, I\u0027ve never seen him act cautiously. He believes it\u0027s best to jump in the fire and deal with the flames when they\u0027re licking the soles of your feet. Keeping silent about my fears, I slot patches of light together and open a white window. With my back to the others, I offer up a quick prayer, the kind I used to reel off when I was a fresh apprentice, before I grew hardened to the terrors of the Demonata. Then, sensing Beranabus behind me, I step forward into the unknown.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-calling-the-demonata-9/page-3.html","bookId":2183,"book":{"id":2183,"title":"Dark Calling (The Demonata #9)","description":"Storyline: Dark Calling (The Demonata #9) I know it\u0027s ridiculous.

Softly, slyly, seductively, insistently. \"Come...\" The Disciples are being manipulated by beings older than time. Only Kernel Fleck knows that something is wrong. But he is in the grip of a creature who cares nothing for the fate of humanity. Voices are calling to him from the darkness and he\u0027s powerless to resist.
