{"id":99994,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"The rising dead terrify me more than any demon ever did. Demons are natural. They obey certain laws. You know what to expect when you face one of them.\\n\\n But the dead aren\u0027t supposed to return. When a body perishes, the soul moves on. That\u0027s the way it\u0027s always been. But someone must have forgotten to mention that to these walking, snarling, slavering corpses.\\n\\n I stand like a simpleton, watching them advance. I\u0027d heard that zombies in movies walk slowly, stiffly, mechanically. Not these. They don\u0027t have the look of living people, but they move like them, fluidly and firmly.\\n\\n As the dead close in on me, teeth exposed, hands outstretched, the ball of light flits over their heads and flares, causing them to cover their eyes and stumble to a halt. They mewl like newborn calves and lash out at the light.\\n\\n \"Come...\" the voice repeats. \"Cross while they are distracted.\"\\n\\n \"Where?\" I howl, gaze fixed on the zombies.\\n\\n \"Come...\" is the only response. The ball of light skims over the heads of the walking dead and hovers by the window.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t,\" I whisper, studying the ranks of animated corpses. \"The others...\"\\n\\n \"Doomed,\" the voice says. \"You cannot worry about them. They are no longer your concern. Come...\" It sounds impatient.\\n\\n A man without a chest-it\u0027s been ripped away, exposing the bones of his spine and shoulders-lowers his arms and blinks. Realizing he can see again, he sets his sights on me and rushes forward, howling wildly.\\n\\n My hands, which have been trembling by my sides, shoot up and I unleash a ball of energy. The dead man flies backwards, knocking down those behind him. As others converge, I blast them with magic and back up close to the window.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" the voice murmurs approvingly.\\n\\n But I\u0027ve no intention of going anywhere with this freakish ball of talking light. I ran out on Beranabus once, long ago. Never again.\\n\\n Taking a firm stand, I construct an invisible barrier, a circle of magic six or seven feet in diameter, through which the dead can\u0027t pass. I\u0027m not good at this type of magic. I doubt I could put a barrier in place strong enough to stop a demon. But if these revived corpses are only as strong as they were in life, it should repel them.\\n\\n My stomach rumbles with fear as the zombies cluster around the barrier. They scrape, punch, kick, and spit at it. I hear-imagine-a creaking noise. I reinforce the barrier, sweating desperately, and turn 360 degrees, trying to cover every angle at once, ensuring there are no weak points.\\n\\n There aren\u0027t. The barrier holds. As long as the magic in the air remains, I can keep these wretched zombies at bay.\\n\\n I\u0027ve been holding my breath. Letting it out, I bend over and smile raggedly. I even manage a weak laugh. That would have been an awful death. To stand up to one powerful demon after another, only to fall to a pack of alarming but relatively weak zombies.... It would have been a shameful way to go.\\n\\n \"You have done well,\" the voice says, pulsing eagerly by the window. \"Now come with me. We must leave this world. We have far to go.\"\\n\\n I straighten and study the ball of light. I\u0027m glad of the excuse not to look at the writhing zombies, especially the children, every bit as ravenous as the adults.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going nowhere without the others,\" I tell it.\\n\\n \"They do not matter. You are the one we need. Come...\"\\n\\n \"Who are \u0027we\u0027?\" I challenge the voice. \"What do you want? Where-\"\\n\\n The ship lurches. I\u0027m thrown sideways, towards the ranks of living dead. I yell with shock, but the barrier deflects me away from the gnashing, grabbing zombies.\\n\\n I get to my feet slowly, rubbing my arm where I collided with the barrier. The ship has tilted. The water in the swimming pool is starting to spill out over the lowest edge, and some of the deck chairs are sliding backwards. A few of the zombies slip away from the barrier, but they\u0027re back again moments later.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s happening?\" I ask the ball of light.\\n\\n \"The ship is sinking,\" it answers. \"Beranabus has been killed. Come now, before it is too late.\"\\n\\n It takes a few seconds for that to hit. At first I\u0027m just panicked that the ship\u0027s going down. Then the full impact of the statement rams home. \"Beranabus?\" I gasp.\\n\\n \"The Shadow killed him.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" I shake my head wildly. Beranabus can\u0027t be dead. The world doesn\u0027t make sense without him. He\u0027s single-handedly held back the hordes of demons for more than a thousand years. I knew he was old and tired, and he often spoke halfheartedly of retiring. But secretly I believed he was invincible, that he\u0027d live forever, reborn like a phoenix when he grew tired of the confines of his old bones.\\n\\n \"There will be no rebirth,\" the voice says calmly as everything collapses into chaos. \"Beranabus is dead. This world will have to struggle on without him. You must come with me. You must.\"\\n\\n I expect tears but there aren\u0027t any. I\u0027m devastated by the loss of Beranabus, and maybe I\u0027ll weep for him later, but for now I\u0027m dry-eyed. When I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not going to cry, I look at the light again. This time I regard it with a hint of loathing.\\n\\n \"You set this up,\" I snarl. \"You led us here. You\u0027re in league with Juni Swan.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" the voice says. \"We do not serve the Demonata.\"\\n\\n \"You split us from Grubbs,\" I accuse it. \"You forced me to advise Beranabus to focus on Juni. This is your work as much as it\u0027s hers.\"\\n\\n The ball is silent for a moment. \"You were aware of our guiding hand,\" it says. \"Interesting. You see and hear more than we thought.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" I laugh roughly. \"And I see through you now. Beranabus would be alive if we hadn\u0027t come here. You manipulated us.\"\\n\\n \"To an extent,\" the voice agrees. \"We needed a lodestone. I could not make the final push to your world without one. So we influenced you and your foes, and tempted you to this place. It is unfortunate that it resulted in Beranabus\u0027s death, but that is an acceptable loss. All that matters is that you come with me. Everything else is immaterial.\"\\n\\n \"Bull!\" I snort.\\n\\n The ball of light flickers. \"I do not understand.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going nowhere. My friends are here-Bec, Dervish, Sharmila. I\u0027m staying to help them. I promised I\u0027d keep this window open and I will.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" the voice says. \"We cannot wait. If you fall, all is lost. I do not have the power to reclaim your fragment of the Kah-Gash. It would go to-\"\\n\\n \"So that\u0027s it,\" I yell. \"You want the weapon.\"\\n\\n \"Only your part.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t have it,\" I sneer, taking a step away from the window.\\n\\n The ball turns dark blue, before resuming its normal variety of colors. I think it just lost its temper.\\n\\n \"You cannot defy us,\" the voice says. \"You must come with me. It is vital.\"\\n\\n I shake my head and back up to within a couple of inches of the barrier. \"My friends come first. Always.\"\\n\\n The ball pulses for a few seconds. Then the voice says, \"Very well.\"\\n\\n The light flicks up over my head and cuts through the barrier, vanishing into the crowd of zombies. The deck is rising steadily. The pool is almost empty now. Some of the less sturdy zombies have started to slide down the deck, towards the end dipping into the sea. But most remain pinned to the barrier.\\n\\n More worrying than the zombies or the disappearance of the ball of light is the fading magic. The bubble around the ship is intact but the magical energy is dwindling. I can still maintain the barrier, but not for long.\\n\\n I think about retreating, closing the window behind me, then building a new one, opening it to whatever level of the ship Bec and the others are on. It wouldn\u0027t take more than a few minutes. But they might not have even that short time. If they make it to the upper deck, this window offers their fastest route out. If I disable it, they\u0027ll have to wait, besieged by zombies, and that might be asking too much of them. Better to linger as long as I can, and only resort to the other plan if the barrier cracks.\\n\\n As I make up my mind to stay, a man steps through the crowd. Most of his throat has been chewed away. His head\u0027s attached to his torso by stray strands of flesh and muscle. He puts his hands on the barrier, palms flat. His calm expression is in sharp contrast to the twisted grimaces of the other zombies. As I stare at the man, wondering why he looks different, light flickers in his eyes. I realize that the ball of light has wormed its way into the zombie and possessed him. Before I can do anything, the man steps through the barrier and clutches me.\\n\\n \"Do not fight,\" he gurgles, pushing me towards the window.\\n\\n \"Let go!\" I roar, wrestling wildly. I manage to slip loose. I think about darting through the window, but that\u0027s where the light wants me to go. Before I can come up with an alternate plan, the zombie grabs me again.\\n\\n \"We do not want to hurt you,\" he says, nudging me closer to the window of white light. \"You must trust us. We only want-\"\\n\\n I knee the man in the stomach. Even though he\u0027s dead, he winces with pain or the memory of it.\\n\\n As I prepare to break free, I spot Bec, Sharmila, Dervish, and a man I don\u0027t recognize. They\u0027re fighting against the tilt of the ship, forcing their way towards me, battling through zombies. Bec spots me locked in combat.\\n\\n \"Kernel!\" she shouts. \"Hold on. We\u0027re almost with you. We-\"\\n\\n \"The lights!\" I roar back in reply. \"The lights are doing this! Don\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \"Enough,\" the man snaps. \"You are coming. Now.\"\\n\\n I reach for his head, to tear it all the way off. Before I can, the man\u0027s eyes open wide and the ball of light gushes from them, as well as from his mouth and the gap in his throat. The light is blinding. I squeeze my eyelids shut, but the glare sears through them and I see almost as clearly as if they were open.\\n\\n As light streams from the man, he explodes, his body ripping apart as if someone had planted a stick of dynamite inside him. The blast sends me flying backwards, through the window, which shatters behind me, stranding the others and cutting me off from the world of all things human. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-calling-the-demonata-9/page-5.html","bookId":2183,"book":{"id":2183,"title":"Dark Calling (The Demonata #9)","description":"Storyline: Dark Calling (The Demonata #9) \\n I know it\u0027s ridiculous.
