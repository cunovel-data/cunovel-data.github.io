{"id":100012,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"It sounds like the entire universe is screaming. Dervish and Grubbs wail for Meera. In the air, Lord Loss bellows Juni\u0027s name and reaches out to her with a couple of his arms, offering Bec a brief respite. The demon hordes screech with delight, the scent of human death like a red rag to a bull. They press even tighter around us, each wanting to be next to claim a soul.\n I drown out the screams and focus on the window. It\u0027s all that matters now. We have seconds to get the hell out of here, or we\u0027ll wind up like Meera. No time for misery or joy. Just focus, work fast, and pray.\n A werewolf is slaughtered and collides with me as it thrashes in its death throes, opening a new, deep cut down the side of my head, just behind my left ear. I shrug it off and concentrate.\n Kirilli leaps high into the air, raining handfuls of bones down upon the demons. He must have picked them up from the floor of the battlefield. They strike like shrapnel, blinding, wounding, killing. He roars with delight-then shrieks as a demon\u0027s jaws flash and his right foot is bitten off at the ankle. Kirilli collapses. His foot drops on top of me and I head it away like a football, never pausing, right hand moving mechanically, fending off demons with my damaged left hand.\n Grubbs head-butts a demon and smashes its skull to pieces. His forehead comes out drenched in brains and foul-smelling fluid. Extending his tongue, he licks his eyes clean and fights on, laughing through his tears.\n Lord Loss and Bec crash to earth, then rise again. They\u0027re still struggling with each other, but he doesn\u0027t seem to be inflicting as much damage. His hands move lazily, more like they\u0027re caressing Bec than savaging her. And she doesn\u0027t react as violently as before. She wriggles less frantically in his embrace, almost as if...\n Before I can complete the thought, a window of pale blue light blinks into existence. I stare at it stupidly. Then exhilaration sweeps through me and I yell at the top of my voice. \"The window is open!\"\n The Demonata scream hatefully and lash at us frantically. The smarter beasts try to crowd around the window, to block our path, but they\u0027re hampered by the mass of demons. There are too many of the monsters. They get in one another\u0027s way.\n Kirilli hops to the window, grabs Dervish\u0027s right arm-he\u0027s still staring at the spot where Meera fell-and topples through, dragging Dervish after him.\n A bloodied, panting Grubbs draws up beside me. He casually repels a handful of demons with one swipe of a massive arm. We\u0027re both looking to the sky overhead where Bec is locked in the embrace of Lord Loss.\n \"Go!\" she yells. \"Leave me!\"\n \"We can\u0027t,\" Grubbs croaks.\n \"We must,\" I mutter as more demons bear down on us, snarling, spitting, claws and fangs at full stretch.\n \"But-\" Grubbs begins.\n \"We\u0027re demon fodder if we stay,\" I snap, then throw myself through the window and out of the demonic universe of death.\n I hit a hard floor and I\u0027m on my feet a split second later. This is the cave where Beranabus and I were based before our quest to find the Shadow began. It was the first place that popped into my mind when I started putting a window together.\n I rip at the fabric of the window, dismantling it, not waiting for Grubbs. If he crosses within the next few seconds, fine. If not, he\u0027s a fool and he\u0027ll deserve all he gets.\n As my hands move within the panel of light, tearing at the individual patches, a werewolf stumbles through, wrapped in the arms of a giant insect-shaped demon. They crash past me and continue their fight on the floor. As Kirilli yelps and slips out of their way, Grubbs backs through the window, bolts of magic flying from his fists, roaring a challenge at those he\u0027s leaving behind.\n Two more werewolves follow their leader into the cave. The head and shoulders of a third appear, but something clutches its legs and hauls it back. It howls and kicks at whatever has hold. Grubbs grabs the creature and pulls. But then the window comes undone. The patches of light pulse and snap free of each other. The panel vanishes and the werewolf\u0027s cut neatly in half, its lower body stranded in the universe of the Demonata, its head and upper arms dropping to the floor here. Its death roar catches in its throat.\n It\u0027s over.\n Well... almost. The insect demon gibbers and breaks free. It darts at the place where the window was, pauses when it realizes it\u0027s trapped, then turns on me. Before it can strike, all three werewolves pounce. They rip it to pieces and feast on the brittle remains, instantly forgetting about the trauma of the battle, fully focused on their meal, ignoring the rest of us as we sink to the floor and stare silently at each other with shock, bewilderment, and dismay.\n Grubbs is the first to move. Rising slowly, groaning painfully, he hobbles over to check on Dervish. His uncle\u0027s in bad shape, the worst of any of us. Blood is pumping from the hole in his chest and I don\u0027t think any amount of magic will stop it. Grubbs starts arguing with him. He wants to open a window back to the demon universe, where Dervish will stand a chance of recovery, but the battered Disciple is having none of it. He told Grubbs a while ago that he wanted to die on Earth when his time came. It looks like he\u0027ll soon be granted his wish.\n \"How\u0027s the foot?\" I ask Kirilli, who\u0027s sitting nearby, staring at the place where his right foot used to be. He\u0027s crying softly.\n \"It\u0027s gone,\" Kirilli moans, then looks up. \"I don\u0027t feel any pain.\"\n \"You will soon,\" I tell him. \"But I can work some magic here. I\u0027ll bandage it up and help numb the pain. Then I\u0027ll open a window and drop you off at a hospital before I leave.\"\n Kirilli doesn\u0027t ask where I\u0027m going. Instead he grins weakly. \"I did good, didn\u0027t I?\" he asks hopefully.\n \"You did great.\" I smile.\n \"I never thought I\u0027d be a hero,\" he whispers. \"I dreamed of it many times but I never believed...\" He falls silent, reliving the highlights, conveniently ignoring the part where he danced like a fool in the stomach of the Shadow. I don\u0027t remind him of that, but fetch bandages from behind the spot where I used to sleep. He\u0027s earned the right to be proud. It\u0027s not stumbling along the way that matters, but how you finish.\n Grubbs limps over as I\u0027m bandaging Kirilli\u0027s ankle and healing it with magic, closing off the veins and arteries. He watches silently until I\u0027m done, then nods at me. Leaving Kirilli, we squat near the place where we once kept a fire burning. Grubbs\u0027s face has altered. He looks more human than he did when he was fighting. He also looks like he\u0027s in a lot of pain, but he says nothing of it.\n \"Meera\u0027s dead,\" he mumbles.\n \"I know.\"\n \"She took Juni with her. I\u0027d have rather killed that traitor myself, but as long as she\u0027s gone...\" He sighs, then says quietly, \"Dervish is dying. He asked me to take him up top, so he can die outside. I need you to open the trapdoor.\"\n We\u0027re deep beneath the ground. A rope ladder leads to the surface, but a stone slab blocks the way out. It\u0027s operated by magic. Focusing, I mutter the correct phrase and set it sliding free. \"Done.\"\n \"Thanks,\" Grubbs says and starts to rise.\n \"I could take him to a hospital with Kirilli,\" I suggest.\n Grubbs shakes his head. \"No point. They couldn\u0027t do anything for him. What a moron, letting the demons bite a chunk out of his chest. He should have kept his guard up. The old fool deserves...\" He shudders, fighting hard to hold back tears.\n \"I\u0027ll wait for you to return,\" I tell him.\n \"That\u0027s OK. Take care of Kirilli. You can come back for me.\"\n \"I\u0027m not coming back.\"\n Grubbs had made it to his feet, but now he pauses, stares at me, and squats again. \"What are you talking about?\" he asks gruffly.\n \"It\u0027s over. I\u0027m going to the ark.\"\n \"You can\u0027t. We need you. This isn\u0027t finished.\"\n \"Of course it is.\" I wipe blood and sweat from my forehead. I feel so weary. It will be a relief to leave this world and the fighting behind. \"We gave it our best shot. We tore the Shadow to pieces. But you heard Beranabus. Death will return, and it\u0027ll be even stronger next time. We can\u0027t defeat it.\"\n \"We have to try,\" Grubbs growls. \"We got the better of it once-we can beat it again. I\u0027ll unleash more of the power of the Kah-Gash next time.\"\n \"How?\" I snort. \"We don\u0027t have Bec. It\u0027s just you and me now.\"\n \"We\u0027ll rescue her,\" Grubbs says, as if it\u0027s the simplest thing in the world. \"Lord Loss won\u0027t kill her. He\u0027ll want to torment her first. I\u0027m guessing he\u0027ll return to his kingdom to wait for the Shadow, and he\u0027ll take her with him.\"\n \"What if he does?\" I sigh. \"We can\u0027t fight him there. We\u0027d stand no chance of defeating a demon master on his home turf.\"\n \"Maybe not,\" Grubbs agrees curtly, \"but we have to try. Everyone\u0027s depending on us. Meera died for this. Dervish will be dead soon too. Beranabus and Bill-E. All the others who\u0027ve given their lives. They can\u0027t have died for nothing. We fight on until the demons kill us all. Only then do we stop.\"\n I shake my head. \"If I stay here and perish, the demons will conquer the universe completely. I shouldn\u0027t have come back at all, but I did, for one last stab at success. We tried and failed. The ark is all that\u0027s left.\"\n I reach out and squeeze Grubbs\u0027s arm. \"Come with me. They\u0027ll welcome you. You can help us keep the ark safe from demons, ensure it never falls to Lord Loss and his stinking kind. It\u0027s the best we can do. Staying here is pointless. The fight has moved on. We have to move with it.\"\n \"Abandon our world?\" Grubbs sneers. \"Leave Bec in the clutches of Lord Loss? Run while the demons are weak? Never! They\u0027ve lost their master. The army will split. They\u0027ll fight with each other and return to their own realms. We can harry them, hit hard, drive the fear of the Kah-Gash into them. This isn\u0027t the end-it\u0027s the beginning. We have the advantage. Now\u0027s the time to press it home and make sure that even if Death does return, it has no army to support it.\"\n \"That won\u0027t work,\" I say impatiently. \"Death\u0027s stronger than us, and it\u0027s eternal. No matter what we do, it will rise again, recruit new followers, and lead them to victory. It\u0027s over.\"\n I stand and roll my neck. I want to sleep so badly. But I\u0027ll wait until I find Raz, then sleep as we travel to the ark. Forcing off the waves of pain and weariness, I focus on the lights in the air around me and think about Raz in the chamber on Atlantis. As patches blink, I start the long, laborious job of piecing them together.\n \"That\u0027s it?\" Grubbs grunts. \"You\u0027re just going to leave us?\"\n \"It will take several hours to open the window. I\u0027ll be here when you get back. You can decide then if you want to come with me or-\"\n \"What about Kirilli?\"\n I wince. \"Damn. I forgot.\" The stage magician is resting, eyes closed, breathing heavily. I let thoughts of Raz slip from my head and think about a hospital instead. It only takes a few minutes to open this window. When it\u0027s ready, I ask Grubbs if he\u0027ll help me carry Kirilli through.\n \"Leave it to me,\" he says, then picks up the wounded Disciple, slings him over his shoulder like a slab of meat, and steps through before the groggy Kirilli has a chance to say goodbye.\n While Grubbs is gone, I think about what I\u0027m going to say when he returns. I have to warn him about Bec, tell him what the Old Creatures cautioned. I recall the way Lord Loss eased up on her and I realize why I felt so troubled. It looked like they were going to stop fighting, as if she\u0027d said something to make peace with him. Could she have betrayed us like Nadia did? I need to alert Grubbs to the threat before he races after her. Maybe she doesn\u0027t want to be rescued. Maybe she\u0027s on their side now.\n As I\u0027m trying to decide where Bec\u0027s loyalties lie, Grubbs steps back through the window. I prepare myself to argue with him again, but he smiles and waves my protests away before I can voice them.\n \"You\u0027re right,\" he chuckles. \"You have to go. I wasn\u0027t thinking straight.\"\n I sigh with relief. \"Will you come with me?\" I\u0027m hoping he says yes. Accepting my role on the ark will be hard. It would be a lot easier if I didn\u0027t have to face it alone.\n \"My place is here,\" he says. \"Dervish, Bec, Shark... those are the people I care about. I don\u0027t care about other worlds. I\u0027ll fight and I\u0027ll die, and if that\u0027s not enough, at least I\u0027ll have done all that I could. That\u0027s what matters most, isn\u0027t it, doing all you can, regardless of the consequences?\"\n \"Yes.\" I smile and extend a hand. \"No hard feelings?\"\n \"None,\" Grubbs says, taking my hand in one of his huge, hairy paws. His smile fades. \"But you might have some.\"\n I frown curiously. Grubbs is gripping my hand tightly. \"What do you-\"\n Before I can complete the question, Grubbs slashes at my face with his other hand. The sharp, bloody, jagged nails that he was gutting demons with just minutes earlier carve my left eye open. As it pops and I howl with shock and agony, he sweeps his hand back in the opposite direction and rips my right eye out. Then he lets me go.\n I fall to the floor screaming, and blindly try to scoop the contents of my ruined eyes back into their sockets.\n \"I didn\u0027t enjoy that,\" Grubbs says, his words only barely penetrating my veil of screams. \"But you agreed-regardless of the consequences. I need you, Kernel. I can\u0027t fight on without you. So you\u0027re staying. End of story.\"\n \"My eyes!\" I bellow, lashing out furiously, hoping to strike him dead. \"Give me back my eyes, you son of a-\"\n \"Can\u0027t,\" Grubbs says calmly. \"But what I will do, once I\u0027m done with Dervish and we\u0027ve had time to patch up our wounds, get our breath back, and link up with support troops, is open a window back to the universe of the Demonata. You\u0027ll be able to build another pair of eyes there. And then you\u0027ll use them to find Bec and help me rescue her.\"\n \"You\u0027re insane!\" I holler, swinging for him again. \"Come here so I can kill you!\"\n \"There\u0027ll be plenty of time for killing,\" Grubbs says, backing away. \"Forget your crazy ark. I\u0027m your keeper now. All other bets are off.\"\n \"Come back!\" I yell, stumbling after him and falling. \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing. You\u0027re handing victory to them. We can\u0027t trust Bec. She\u0027ll betray us. Lord Loss will be waiting. Death will...\"\n I stop. I\u0027ve been shouting to myself. I can hear Grubbs scrabbling up the rope ladder with Dervish, ignorant of my cries. Apart from the werewolves, which are still snacking on the insect demon\u0027s remains, I\u0027m alone.\n Abandoned and blind, I strike the floor pitifully, then moan softly and lower my face into the blood and dust, wishing the roof would cave in and finish me off. If I still had eyes, I\u0027d weep, not for myself, but for the multitudes of creatures who\u0027ll have nowhere to hide when their worlds burn.\n \"What the hell have we done?\" I sob.\n All that you could, I imagine the voice of Beranabus whispering. And then, after a short, bitter pause, he adds with a sarcastic chuckle, But it wasn\u0027t enough. This universe is finished.
