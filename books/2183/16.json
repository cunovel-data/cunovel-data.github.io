There are banks of sophisticated-looking computers running along the sides. \"Not so sophisticated really,\" Raz murmurs. \"This was designed as a viewing station by one of the lesser species. We could have arranged a more advanced craft, but they like to do things themselves. Look down.\" I nudge to the edge, not sure what to expect. As I approach, panels of glass slide back and a telescope revolves into place before me. A world like Earth lies a few miles below. There are massive buildings, wide roads, parks, and ponds. Some of the buildings have glass roofs or are open-topped. I can see all sorts of creatures moving around inside them, a bewildering variety of animals, birds, lizards, and more, many defying description. \"It looks like a zoo,\" I remark. \"It is,\" Raz says. \"But all of them have souls and are here of their own choice. They know of the Demonata and the threat this universe faces, and have pledged themselves to our cause.\" The air hums with magic. As I cast my gaze around, I spot lodestones dotted everywhere, of all shapes and sizes. \"It\u0027s an ark,\" Raz says. \"You know the biblical story of the ark, how Noah took in a pair of every species and spared them from the flood.\" \"Was that real?\" I ask. \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" he waves the question away. \"Our ark is real, and we have to deal with far worse than a flood. This is why you\u0027re here, why we\u0027ve shown you all that you\u0027ve seen and revealed so much.\" \"I don\u0027t get it. You want me to live here?\" Raz laughs. \"We\u0027d have brought you here directly if that was the case, telling you only as much as you needed to know, as we did with the others. There are already humans on this ark. Your people are not among the more advanced, but we brought some here anyway, for you.\" \"I\u0027m still lost,\" I mutter. \"We want you to be the new Noah,\" Raz says. \"We want you to protect these creatures and guide them, evading the Demonata and Death, always remaining one step ahead of those who would destroy them. We want you to save the universe.\" It sounds ridiculous. I\u0027m tempted to laugh. Except I know Raz isn\u0027t joking. \"How?\" I whisper. \"We\u0027ve planted scores of lodestones across this planet,\" Raz says. \"Enough to last an eternity. This is a world of never-ending magical energy. We designed it to be a haven, a warship, a nursery. Food will always be abundant. Species will never struggle with infertility. Magicians will be born to every generation.\" \"You\u0027re going to make a last stand here?\" I frown. \"This is a fortress?\" \"No fortress could stand against our enemies,\" Raz says. \"If this world was a thousand times more powerful than it is, it still wouldn\u0027t hold long against a mass demon attack. The Demonata don\u0027t know about the ark yet, but they\u0027ll discover it eventually and come. When they arrive, it must not be here.\" \"Huh?\" I gape. \"We will ensure they never open a tunnel to this world, by guarding each stone zealously. With no direct route of attack, Death will lead them to nearby planets and they\u0027ll launch armies from there. When that happens... when the net is closing and the end looks certain... it will be your time.\" \"What am I supposed to do?\" I scowl. \"Hold up a STOP sign?\" \"You will open a window and slip away to another part of the universe,\" Raz says. \"And you\u0027ll take the planet with you.\" He says it so simply that at first I nod as if it\u0027s no big thing. Then it hits me and I turn from the edge of the platform and stare incredulously. \"Take the planet with me?\" I repeat stupidly. \"When you\u0027ve opened windows before, others have been able to slip through. This will be similar, only you\u0027ll have to open a bigger window.\" \"You\u0027re insane!\" I yelp. \"I\u0027ve never opened a window more then seven or eight feet tall.\" \"That\u0027s because you never needed a larger window,\" Raz says calmly. \"You can do far more than you\u0027ve demanded of yourself. With our guidance you\u0027ll learn to open a larger window and curve it, so it surrounds the world. That way, rather than propel the world through the window, it can close around the planet.\" I stare at Raz wordlessly. I don\u0027t know what to think. \"Think of victory,\" Raz growls. \"Think of life. Think of the demons you\u0027ll defy, the doom you\u0027ll spare everyone here.\" \"It\u0027s impossible...\" \"No,\" Raz insists. \"It can work. That\u0027s no guarantee that it will-there might be obstacles ahead that we can\u0027t predict-but we believe in the plan.\" My mind\u0027s whirling. \"But when I die, my piece of the Kah-Gash will link up with the others. You\u0027ve already said you can\u0027t control it.\" Raz clears his throat. \"That brings us to the part you\u0027re not going to like. As you say, we won\u0027t be able to harness your piece of the Kah-Gash when you die, so we need to find a way around that. Kernel, what would you think if we asked you to make the ultimate sacrifice for the sake of the universe?\" \"You want me to kill myself?\" I ask with surprising calmness. \"No.\" Raz leans forward, eyes sparkling. \"We want you to live forever!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-calling-the-demonata-9/page-16.html","bookId":2183,"book":{"id":2183,"title":"Dark Calling (The Demonata #9)","description":"Storyline: Dark Calling (The Demonata #9) I know it\u0027s ridiculous.
