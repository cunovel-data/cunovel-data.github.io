{"id":26871,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII — DICK\u0027S EARLY HISTORY","content":"\"Have you always lived in New York, Dick?\" asked Frank, after a pause. \"Ever since I can remember.\" \"I wish you\u0027d tell me a little about yourself. Have you got any father or mother?\" \"I aint got no mother. She died when I wasn\u0027t but three years old. My father went to sea; but he went off before mother died, and nothin\u0027 was ever heard of him. I expect he got wrecked, or died at sea.\" \"And what became of you when your mother died?\" \"The folks she boarded with took care of me, but they was poor, and they couldn\u0027t do much. When I was seven the woman died, and her husband went out West, and then I had to scratch for myself.\" \"At seven years old!\" exclaimed Frank, in amazement. \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"I was a little feller to take care of myself, but,\" he continued with pardonable pride, \"I did it.\" \"What could you do?\" \"Sometimes one thing, and sometimes another,\" said Dick. \"I changed my business accordin\u0027 as I had to. Sometimes I was a newsboy, and diffused intelligence among the masses, as I heard somebody say once in a big speech he made in the Park. Them was the times when Horace Greeley and James Gordon Bennett made money.\" \"Through your enterprise?\" suggested Frank. \"Yes,\" said Dick; \"but I give it up after a while.\" \"What for?\" \"Well, they didn\u0027t always put news enough in their papers, and people wouldn\u0027t buy \u0027em as fast as I wanted \u0027em to. So one mornin\u0027 I was stuck on a lot of Heralds, and I thought I\u0027d make a sensation. So I called out \u0027GREAT NEWS! QUEEN VICTORIA ASSASSINATED!\u0027 All my Heralds went off like hot cakes, and I went off, too, but one of the gentlemen what got sold remembered me, and said he\u0027d have me took up, and that\u0027s what made me change my business.\" \"That wasn\u0027t right, Dick,\" said Frank. \"I know it,\" said Dick; \"but lots of boys does it.\" \"That don\u0027t make it any better.\" \"No,\" said Dick, \"I was sort of ashamed at the time, \u0027specially about one poor old gentleman,—a Englishman he was. He couldn\u0027t help cryin\u0027 to think the queen was dead, and his hands shook when he handed me the money for the paper.\" \"What did you do next?\" \"I went into the match business,\" said Dick; \"but it was small sales and small profits. Most of the people I called on had just laid in a stock, and didn\u0027t want to buy. So one cold night, when I hadn\u0027t money enough to pay for a lodgin\u0027, I burned the last of my matches to keep me from freezin\u0027. But it cost too much to get warm that way, and I couldn\u0027t keep it up.\" \"You\u0027ve seen hard times, Dick,\" said Frank, compassionately. \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"I\u0027ve knowed what it was to be hungry and cold, with nothin\u0027 to eat or to warm me; but there\u0027s one thing I never could do,\" he added, proudly. \"What\u0027s that?\" \"I never stole,\" said Dick. \"It\u0027s mean and I wouldn\u0027t do it.\" \"Were you ever tempted to?\" \"Lots of times. Once I had been goin\u0027 round all day, and hadn\u0027t sold any matches, except three cents\u0027 worth early in the mornin\u0027. With that I bought an apple, thinkin\u0027 I should get some more bimeby. When evenin\u0027 come I was awful hungry. I went into a baker\u0027s just to look at the bread. It made me feel kind o\u0027 good just to look at the bread and cakes, and I thought maybe they would give me some. I asked \u0027em wouldn\u0027t they give me a loaf, and take their pay in matches. But they said they\u0027d got enough matches to last three months; so there wasn\u0027t any chance for a trade. While I was standin\u0027 at the stove warmin\u0027 me, the baker went into a back room, and I felt so hungry I thought I would take just one loaf, and go off with it. There was such a big pile I don\u0027t think he\u0027d have known it.\" \"But you didn\u0027t do it?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t and I was glad of it, for when the man came in ag\u0027in, he said he wanted some one to carry some cake to a lady in St. Mark\u0027s Place. His boy was sick, and he hadn\u0027t no one to send; so he told me he\u0027d give me ten cents if I would go. My business wasn\u0027t very pressin\u0027 just then, so I went, and when I come back, I took my pay in bread and cakes. Didn\u0027t they taste good, though?\" \"So you didn\u0027t stay long in the match business, Dick?\" \"No, I couldn\u0027t sell enough to make it pay. Then there was some folks that wanted me to sell cheaper to them; so I couldn\u0027t make any profit. There was one old lady—she was rich, too, for she lived in a big brick house—beat me down so, that I didn\u0027t make no profit at all; but she wouldn\u0027t buy without, and I hadn\u0027t sold none that day; so I let her have them. I don\u0027t see why rich folks should be so hard upon a poor boy that wants to make a livin\u0027.\" \"There\u0027s a good deal of meanness in the world, I\u0027m afraid, Dick.\" \"If everybody was like you and your uncle,\" said Dick, \"there would be some chance for poor people. If I was rich I\u0027d try to help \u0027em along.\" \"Perhaps you will be rich sometime, Dick.\" Dick shook his head. \"I\u0027m afraid all my wallets will be like this,\" said Dick, indicating the one he had received from the dropper, \"and will be full of papers what aint of no use to anybody except the owner.\" \"That depends very much on yourself, Dick,\" said Frank. \"Stewart wasn\u0027t always rich, you know.\" \"Wasn\u0027t he?\" \"When he first came to New York as a young man he was a teacher, and teachers are not generally very rich. At last he went into business, starting in a small way, and worked his way up by degrees. But there was one thing he determined in the beginning: that he would be strictly honorable in all his dealings, and never overreach any one for the sake of making money. If there was a chance for him, Dick, there is a chance for you.\" \"He knowed enough to be a teacher, and I\u0027m awful ignorant,\" said Dick. \"But you needn\u0027t stay so.\" \"How can I help it?\" \"Can\u0027t you learn at school?\" \"I can\u0027t go to school \u0027cause I\u0027ve got my livin\u0027 to earn. It wouldn\u0027t do me much good if I learned to read and write, and just as I\u0027d got learned I starved to death.\" \"But are there no night-schools?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why don\u0027t you go? I suppose you don\u0027t work in the evenings.\" \"I never cared much about it,\" said Dick, \"and that\u0027s the truth. But since I\u0027ve got to talkin\u0027 with you, I think more about it. I guess I\u0027ll begin to go.\" \"I wish you would, Dick. You\u0027ll make a smart man if you only get a little education.\" \"Do you think so?\" asked Dick, doubtfully. \"I know so. A boy who has earned his own living since he was seven years old must have something in him. I feel very much interested in you, Dick. You\u0027ve had a hard time of it so far in life, but I think better times are in store. I want you to do well, and I feel sure you can if you only try.\" \"You\u0027re a good fellow,\" said Dick, gratefully. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m a pretty rough customer, but I aint as bad as some. I mean to turn over a new leaf, and try to grow up \u0027spectable.\" \"There\u0027ve been a great many boys begin as low down as you, Dick, that have grown up respectable and honored. But they had to work pretty hard for it.\" \"I\u0027m willin\u0027 to work hard,\" said Dick. \"And you must not only work hard, but work in the right way.\" \"What\u0027s the right way?\" \"You began in the right way when you determined never to steal, or do anything mean or dishonorable, however strongly tempted to do so. That will make people have confidence in you when they come to know you. But, in order to succeed well, you must manage to get as good an education as you can. Until you do, you cannot get a position in an office or counting-room, even to run errands.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" said Dick, soberly. \"I never thought how awful ignorant I was till now.\" \"That can be remedied with perseverance,\" said Frank. \"A year will do a great deal for you.\" \"I\u0027ll go to work and see what I can do,\" said Dick, energetically. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2996/82654.html","bookId":305,"book":{"id":305,"title":"Ragged Dick","description":"简介： Ragged Dick was contributed as a serial story to the pages of the Schoolmate, a well-known juvenile magazine, during the year 1867.
