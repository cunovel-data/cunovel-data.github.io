{"id":5959,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9 A First Essay In Love","content":"PRETENDING to gather some \"American fruit\" from a tree, Lubotshka suddenly plucked a leaf upon which was a huge caterpillar, and throwing the insect with horror to the ground, lifted her hands and sprang away as though afraid it would spit at her. The game stopped, and we crowded our heads together as we stooped to look at the curiosity.\\n\\n I peeped over Katenka\u0027s shoulder as she was trying to lift the caterpillar by placing another leaf in its way. I had observed before that the girls had a way of shrugging their shoulders whenever they were trying to put a loose garment straight on their bare necks, as well as that Mimi always grew angry on witnessing this manoeuvre and declared it to be a chambermaid\u0027s trick. As Katenka bent over the caterpillar she made that very movement, while at the same instant the breeze lifted the fichu on her white neck. Her shoulder was close to my lips, I looked at it and kissed it, She did not turn round, but Woloda remarked without raising his head, \"What spooniness!\" I felt the tears rising to my eyes, and could not take my gaze from Katenka. I had long been used to her fair, fresh face, and had always been fond of her, but now I looked at her more closely, and felt more fond of her, than I had ever done or felt before.\\n\\n When we returned to the grown-ups, Papa informed us, to our great joy, that, at Mamma\u0027s entreaties, our departure was to be postponed until the following morning. We rode home beside the carriage--Woloda and I galloping near it, and vieing with one another in our exhibition of horsemanship and daring. My shadow looked longer now than it had done before, and from that I judged that I had grown into a fine rider. Yet my complacency was soon marred by an unfortunate occurrence, Desiring to outdo Woloda before the audience in the carriage, I dropped a little behind.\\n\\n Then with whip and spur I urged my steed forward, and at the\\n\\n same time assumed a natural, graceful attitude, with the intention\\n\\n of whooting past the carriage on the side on which Katenka was\\n\\n seated. My only doubt was whether to halloo or not as I did so.\\n\\n In the event, my infernal horse stopped so abruptly when just\\n\\n level with the carriage horses that I was pitched forward on\\n\\n to its neck and cut a very sorry figure!\\n\\n \\n\\n 柳博奇卡装做从树上摘一种美国水果的样子，她揪下的一片树叶上有一条大毛毛虫，她恐怖地把它扔到地上，举起双手跳到一旁，好象害怕里边会窜出什么东西似的。游戏停止了。我们都伏在地上，头凑在一起，观察这个稀奇的东西。\\n\\n 我从卡简卡的肩头望过去，她把一片叶子放在毛毛虫爬行的路上，想把它拾起来。\\n\\n 我注意到，好多姑娘都有耸肩膀的习惯，想用这种动作调整一下滑下肩头的开领衣裳。我还记得，米米看见这种动作总是很生气，说：“C’est un geste de f emme chambre ① ”。卡简卡伏在毛毛虫上面时，就做了这种动作，同时一阵清风吹起她因在脖颈上的小围巾。她做这个动作的时候，她的肩膀离我的嘴唇只有两指远。我不再降毛毛虫了，看着看着，我就使劲吻了吻卡简卡的肩头。她没有回过头来，但是我觉察到，她的勃颈和耳朵都红了。沃洛佳头也没抬，轻蔑地说：\\n\\n --------\\n\\n ①c’est un gesre de femmede chambre：法语“这是使女的姿势。”\\n\\n “这算什么柔情呀？”\\n\\n 我的眼里涌出了泪水。\\n\\n 我目不转晴地望着卡简卡。我早就看惯了她那金发下面鲜艳的小脸蛋，总是很喜欢它；现在我愈是仔细地观察，我就愈喜欢它了。我们回到大人们那里的时候，使我们大为高兴的是，爸爸宣布说，由于妈妈的请求，我们推迟到明天早晨动身。\\n\\n 我们骑着马跟着马车一起回去。沃洛佳和我想在骑术和胆量上比个高低，在马车旁边大显身手。我的影子比以前长了些，根据影子来判断，我想像我具有十分漂亮的骑手的姿态；但是我体验到的这种自我欣赏的心情，不久就被下面桩事故破坏了。我为了要迷住坐在马车里的所有的人，就落后一点，然后鞭打脚踢，策马前进，摆出从容而优雅的姿势，想要象一阵旋风似的从卡简卡坐的马车那边冲过去。只是我不知道，究竟是不声不响地疾驰过去好呢，还是大喊一声的好。但是，我那匹可恶的马在和拉着车的马齐头并进的时候，任凭我怎么努力，还是停了下来，而且停得那么突然，使我从马鞍上滑到马颈上，险些儿摔下去。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/291/2829.html","bookId":191,"book":{"id":191,"title":"童年 Childhood","description":"简介： 50年代，托尔斯泰在高加索入伍期间开始了文学创作。处女作《童年》（1852）通过对小主人公伊尔倩耶夫的单纯而又富有诗意的内心世界的细致入微的描摹，出色地表现了一个出身贵族...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/291","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:23 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:23 AM"}}
