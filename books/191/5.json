{"id":5955,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5 The Idiot","content":"The man who now entered the room was about fifty years old, with a pale, attenuated face pitted with smallpox, long grey hair, and a scanty beard of a reddish hue. Likewise he was so tall that, on coming through the doorway, he was forced not only to bend his head, but to incline his whole body forward. He was dressed in a sort of smock that was much torn, and held in his hand a stout staff. As he entered he smote this staff upon the floor, and, contracting his brows and opening his mouth to its fullest extent, laughed in a dreadful, unnatural way. He had lost the sight of one eye, and its colourless pupil kept rolling about and imparting to his hideous face an even more repellent expression than it otherwise bore. \"Hullo, you are caught!\" he exclaimed as he ran to Woloda with little short steps and, seizing him round the head, looked at it searchingly. Next he left him, went to the table, and, with a perfectly serious expression on his face, began to blow under the oil-cloth, and to make the sign of the cross over it, \"O-oh, what a pity! O-oh, how it hurts! They are angry! They fly from me!\" he exclaimed in a tearful choking voice as he glared at Woloda and wiped away the streaming tears with his sleeve, His voice was harsh and rough, all his movements hysterical and spasmodic, and his words devoid of sense or connection (for he used no conjunctions). Yet the tone of that voice was so heartrending, and his yellow, deformed face at times so sincere and pitiful in its expression, that, as one listened to him, it was impossible to repress a mingled sensation of pity, grief, and fear. This was the idiot Grisha. Whence he had come, or who were his parents, or what had induced him to choose the strange life which he led, no one ever knew. All that I myself knew was that from his fifteenth year upwards he had been known as an imbecile who went barefooted both in winter and summer, visited convents, gave little images to any one who cared to take them, and spoke meaningless words which some people took for prophecies; that nobody remembered him as being different; that at, rate intervals he used to call at Grandmamma\u0027s house; and that by some people he was said to be the outcast son of rich parents and a pure, saintly soul, while others averred that he was a mere peasant and an idler. At last the punctual and wished-for Foka arrived, and we went downstairs. Grisha followed us sobbing and continuing to talk nonsense, and knocking his staff on each step of the staircase. When we entered the drawing-room we found Papa and Mamma walking up and down there, with their hands clasped in each other\u0027s, and talking in low tones. Maria Ivanovna was sitting bolt upright in an arm-chair placed at tight angles to the sofa, and giving some sort of a lesson to the two girls sitting beside her. When Karl Ivanitch entered the room she looked at him for a moment, and then turned her eyes away with an expression which seemed to say, \"You are beneath my notice, Karl Ivanitch.\" It was easy to see from the girls\u0027 eyes that they had important news to communicate to us as soon as an opportunity occurred (for to leave their seats and approach us first was contrary to Mimi\u0027s rules). It was for us to go to her and say, \"Bon jour, Mimi,\" and then make her a low bow; after which we should possibly be permitted to enter into conversation with the girls. What an intolerable creature that Mimi was! One could hardly say a word in her presence without being found fault with. Also whenever we wanted to speak in Russian, she would say, \"Parlez, donc, francais,\" as though on purpose to annoy us, while, if there was any particularly nice dish at luncheon which we wished to enjoy in peace, she would keep on ejaculating, \"Mangez, donc, avec du pain!\" or, \"Comment est-ce que vous tenez votre fourchette?\" \"What has SHE got to do with us?\" I used to think to myself. \"Let her teach the girls. WE have our Karl Ivanitch.\" I shared to the full his dislike of \"certain people.\" \"Ask Mamma to let us go hunting too,\" Katenka whispered to me, as she caught me by the sleeve just when the elders of the family were making a move towards the dining-room. \"Very well. I will try.\" Grisha likewise took a seat in the dining-room, but at a little table apart from the rest. He never lifted his eyes from his plate, but kept on sighing and making horrible grimaces, as he muttered to himself: \"What a pity! It has flown away! The dove is flying to heaven! The stone lies on the tomb!\" and so forth. Ever since the morning Mamma had been absent-minded, and Grisha\u0027s presence, words, and actions seemed to make her more so. \"By the way, there is something I forgot to ask you,\" she said, as she handed Papa a plate of soup, \"What is it?\" \"That you will have those dreadful dogs of yours tied up, They nearly worried poor Grisha to death when he entered the courtyard, and I am sure they will bite the children some day.\" No sooner did Grisha hear himself mentioned that he turned towards our table and showed us his torn clothes. Then, as he went on with his meal, he said: \"He would have let them tear me in pieces, but God would not allow it! What a sin to let the dogs loose--a great sin! But do not beat him, master; do not beat him! It is for God to forgive! It is past now!\" \"What does he say?\" said Papa, looking at him gravely and sternly. \"I cannot understand him at all.\" \"I think he is saying,\" replied Mamma, \"that one of the huntsmen set the dogs on him, but that God would not allow him to be torn in pieces, Therefore he begs you not to punish the man.\" \"Oh, is that it? \" said Papa, \"How does he know that I intended to punish the huntsman? You know, I am pot very fond of fellows like this,\" he added in French, \"and this one offends me particularly. Should it ever happen that--\" \"Oh, don\u0027t say so,\" interrupted Mamma, as if frightened by some thought. \"How can you know what he is?\" \"I think I have plenty of opportunities for doing so, since no lack of them come to see you--all of them the same sort, and probably all with the same story.\" I could see that Mamma\u0027s opinion differed from his, but that she did not mean to quarrel about it. \"Please hand me the cakes,\" she said to him, \"Are they good to- day or not?\" \"Yes, I AM angry,\" he went on as he took the cakes and put them where Mamma could not reach them, \"very angry at seeing supposedly reasonable and educated people let themselves be deceived,\" and he struck the table with his fork. \"I asked you to hand me the cakes,\" she repeated with outstretched hand. \"And it is a good thing,\" Papa continued as he put the hand aside, \"that the police run such vagabonds in. All they are good for is to play upon the nerves of certain people who are already not over-strong in that respect,\" and he smiled, observing that Mamma did not like the conversation at all. However, he handed her the cakes. \"All that I have to say,\" she replied, \"is that one can hardly believe that a man who, though sixty years of age, goes barefooted winter and summer, and always wears chains of two pounds\u0027 weight, and never accepts the offers made to him to live a quiet, comfortable life--it is difficult to believe that such a man should act thus out of laziness.\" Pausing a moment, she added with a sigh: \"As to predictions, je suis payee pour y croire, I told you, I think, that Grisha prophesied the very day and hour of poor Papa\u0027s death?\" \"Oh, what HAVE you gone and done?\" said Papa, laughing and putting his hand to his cheek (whenever he did this I used to look for something particularly comical from him). \"Why did you call my attention to his feet? I looked at them, and now can eat nothing more.\" Luncheon was over now, and Lubotshka and Katenka were winking at us, fidgeting about in their chairs, and showing great restlessness. The winking, of course, signified, \"Why don\u0027t you ask whether we too may go to the hunt?\" I nudged Woloda, and Woloda nudged me back, until at last I took heart of grace, and began (at first shyly, but gradually with more assurance) to ask if it would matter much if the girls too were allowed to enjoy the sport. Thereupon a consultation was held among the elder folks, and eventually leave was granted--Mamma, to make things still more delightful, saying that she would come too, 一个五十来岁的人走进屋里来，他脸色苍白，长脸盘，一脸大麻子，留着长长的白发和几绺稀疏的红胡子。他身材非常高大，进门时不但要低下头，连整个身子都得弯下来。他穿着一件破布杉，这布衫既象农民的长襟外衣，又象神甫的白袍，手里拿着一根大拐杖。进屋时，他用拐杖拚命敲了一下地板，扬着眉毛，嘴列得特别大，发出非常可怕、非常不自然的哈哈大笑声。他瞎了一只眼睛，那只眼睛的白瞳仁不住地乱转，给他那本来就很丑陋的面孔增添了更加让人讨厌的神气。 “啊哈，捉住了！”他喊道，小步跑到沃洛佳跟前，抱住他的头，仔细察看他的头顶，随后带着十分严肃的神色放开沃洛佳，走到桌子跟前，向漆布下面吹气，在漆布上面画十字。“噢，可怜啊！噢，痛苦啊！……小宝贝们啊……就要飞走了。”他用一种颤巍巍的悲泣声音说着，感伤地望着沃洛佳，并且用袖口去擦当真掉下来的眼泪。 他的嗓音粗浊沙哑，动作慌里慌张，语无伦次（他永远不用代词），但是发的重音却那么动听，焦黄的丑脸上有时露出非常坦率的悲哀神色。听他讲话，不能不使人产生一种又是惋惜、又是恐惧、又是悲伤的复杂心情。 这就是那个苦行者，巡礼者格里沙。 他是什么来历？他的父母是谁？是什么迫使他选择了他过的这种流浪生活？谁也不了解这一点。我只知道，他从十五岁起，就成了尽人皆知的苦行者、无论冬复，他都光着脚行走，朝拜寺院，把小圣像赠给他喜爱的人，说些费解的话。有的人认为这些话是预言。从来没有人见过他是另外一种情形。有时他到我外祖母家去。有人说他是富家的不幸子弟，是个心地纯洁的人、又有人说他不过是个庄稼人，是个懒汉。 那个严守时刻、令人望眼欲穿的福加终于出现了，我们于是下楼去。格里沙呜咽着，继续讲一些语无伦次的话，他跟在我们后面，用拐杖敲打着楼梯的阶梯。爸爸和妈妈挽着胳臂在客厅里踱来踱去，低声交谈着什么。玛丽雅·伊凡诺芙娜规规矩矩坐在紧挨着沙发、按照直角形对称摆着的一把安乐椅上，用严厉但却沉着的声音教训坐在她身边的姑娘们。卡尔·伊凡内奇一走进房间，她瞅了他一眼，马上就扭过身去。她脸上露出一种可以这样解释的表情： “我没有注意您，卡尔·伊凡内奇。”从姑娘们的眼色中可以看出，她们急着要告诉我们一件十分重要的消息；但是离开自己的座位跑到我们跟前，这是米米的规矩所不允许的。我们得先走到她跟前，说一声：“Bonjour，Mimi！ ① ”立正行个礼，然后才能开始谈话。 -------- ①“Bonjour，Mimi！”：法语“您好，米米！” 这个米米是个多么令人讨厌的女人啊！当着她的面什么都不能讲，她认为一切都不成体统。另外，她还喋喋不休地要我们“Parlez dons francais ① ””，可是那时，我们好象要故意惹她生气似的，偏想说俄语。要不就是在吃饭的时候，某样菜合你的胃口，希望没有人来干涉你的时候，她一定会说：“Mangez donc avec dupain ② ”或是“Comment ce que vous tenez votre fourchette？ ③ ”你会这样想，“她和我们有什么相干呀？让她管教她的姑娘们去好了。有卡尔·伊凡内奇管我们。”在厌恶某些人方面，我和他完全有同感。 -------- ①parlez dons francais：法语“说法文”。 ②Mangezdonc avec du Pain：法语“就着面包吃吧。” ③“comment ce gue vous tenez votre fourchette？”：法语“你这是怎么拿叉子的？” “去央求一下妈妈，让他们带我们去打猎吧。”大人们领头到饭厅去的时候，卡简卡拉住我的短外套，小声说。 “好，我们试试吧。” 格里沙在饭厅里吃饭，不过在另一张小桌上；他眼睛抬不抬，紧盯着碟子，有时叹一口气，扮个吓人的鬼脸，并且好象自言自语似地说：“可怜！……飞走了，鸽子要飞上天了……啊，坟上有一块石头！……以及诸如此类的话。 妈妈从早晨起就心绪不宁；格里沙的来临、他的言语和行动，显然使她更加心烦意乱。 “噢，对啦，我还忘记求你一件事。”她把一盘汤递给父亲时说。“什么事？” “请你叫人把你那群凶狗锁起来吧。你瞧，格里沙进院子的时候，它们险些儿把这个可怜的人咬伤了。象这样，它们也可能向孩子们扑过去。” 格里沙听人谈到自己，就扭过身朝着大饭桌，指指自己身上被撕破的衣襟，嘴里一边咀嚼，一边都囔说： “想把我咬死……上帝不允许。纵狗伤人是有罪的！大大的罪过！不要打，当家的 ① ，为什么要打啊！上帝会饶恕的……世道不同了。” -------- ①当家的：他对所有的男人都一律这样称呼。--作者原住。 “他说些什么？”爸爸问，很严历地瞪着眼看他。“我一点也不懂。” “但是我懂，”妈妈回答说，“他对我讲，有一个猎人故意纵狗咬他，所以他说，‘想把我咬死，但是上帝不允许，’他求你不要为这件事处罚那个猎人。” “啊！原来如此！”爸爸说。“他怎么知道我要处罚那个猎人呢？你要知道，我一向不大喜欢这样的先生们，”他用法语继续说，“不过，这位我觉得特别讨厌，想必……” “噢，不要说这话，亲爱的！”妈妈好象吃惊似的，打断了爸爸的话头。“你怎么知道呢？” “我似乎有机会研究这一类人，他们之中来拜访你的很多，全都一模一样。说来说去总是那么一套……” 显然，在这一点上母亲抱着完全不同的看法，不过她不愿意争论。 “请递给我一个油炸包子，”她说。“怎么样，今天的油炸包子好吃吗？” “不，我很生气，”爸爸接着说，他拿起一个油炸包子，但是离得那么远，妈妈根本够不着它。“不，当我看见有头脑、有教养的人落到骗局的时候，我很生气。” 说着，他用叉子敲敲桌子。 “我请你递给我一个油炸包子，”她又说了一遍，伸出手去。 “把这帮人关到警察局去，可算做了好事啦！”爸爸接着说，把手缩回来。“这帮家伙带来的唯一好处，就是使一些女人本来就很脆弱的神经更乱。”他笑着补充说，看到妈妈很不喜欢这场谈话，就把油炸包子递给了她。 “在这方面，我只想对你说明这样一点：一个六十岁的人，无论冬夏都光着脚走路，衣服下面总带着两普特重的铁链，再三再四拒绝人家给他的供给膳宿的舒适生活，我们很难相信这种人只是为了懒惰才采取这一切行动。至于说到预言，“她沉默了一会儿，叹了口气又说，“je suis payee pour y croire； ① 我好象告诉过你，连我父亲将在一天，哪个时辰逝世，基留沙都向他预言了。” -------- ①je suis payee pour Y crae：法语“我是吃了苦头才相信的。” “噢，你要拿我怎么样啊？”爸爸说，笑着把靠米米那边的那只手捂到嘴上。（他这样做的时候，我总是紧张地听着，等着听一些笑话。）“你为什么对我提到他的脚呢？我看了一眼，现在什么都吃不下了。” 午饭快要吃完了。柳博奇卡和卡简卡直向我使眼色，在椅子上扭来扭去，总之，她们显得非常不安。这种眼色是说：“你们怎么不请求他们带我们去打猎呀？”我用胳臂肘推了推沃洛佳。沃洛佳推了推我，他终于鼓起勇气，起先声音还是畏怯的，随后就相当坚决而响亮地解释说，今天我们就要走了，因此很想带着姑娘们一道坐敞篷马车去打猎。大人们讨论了一下，这个问题就依着我们的心意解决了，更令人高兴的是，妈妈说她自己也要跟我们去。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/291/2825.html","bookId":191,"book":{"id":191,"title":"童年 Childhood","description":"简介： 50年代，托尔斯泰在高加索入伍期间开始了文学创作。处女作《童年》（1852）通过对小主人公伊尔倩耶夫的单纯而又富有诗意的内心世界的细致入微的描摹，出色地表现了一个出身贵族...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/291","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:23 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:23 AM"}}
