{"id":81873,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Henry heard the pounding as he raced down the corridor leading to the lab, heard it and would have ignored it had it not been accompanied by a fine libretto of Italian profanity. He rocked to a stop in front of an old paneled door, saw that the doorknob had been bent down in such a way as to render it nonfunctional, and solved the problem by bracing one hand against the wall and yanking the entire mechanism out of the wood.\n The door crashed back and Celluci exploded out into the hall, the force of his exit throwing him to his knees.\n Grabbing him by the collar, Henry hauled him to his feet, blocking the resulting flurry of blows with his other arm.\n Celluci\u0027s snarled challenge broke off as he finally recognized the vampire. \"Where the hell were you?\" he demanded.\n \"Finding my way back,\" Henry answered coldly. \"What were you doing in there?\"\n \"Trying to get out.\" The tone matched exactly. \"I heard Vicki scream.\"\n \"So did I.\"\n Together they turned and ran toward the lab.\n As they raced through the doorway, the bloodscent hit Henry an almost solid blow, too close now to be masked by either decay or the alcohol vapor still seeping into the air. Far from replete, the Hunger rose. For Vicki\u0027s sake Henry held it, and forced it back; he couldn\u0027t help her if he lost control. While he struggled to maintain reason, Celluci pulled ahead.\n It seemed there were bodies all over the room, but Celluci only saw one that mattered. Sprawled on her back to one side of the isolation box, Vicki lay motionless except for the purely kinetic jerk that occurred when a blow landed. He saw the steel bar go up and come down, then, howling in inarticulate rage, he grabbed the pale-haired woman by the shoulders and flung her behind him.\n \"Your fault, too!\" Catherine screamed, launching herself back, the jagged end of the bar dripping crimson.\n There was no time for Celluci to prepare himself for the attack. Then, all at once, there was no attack.\n His arm darting out faster than mortal eye could follow, Henry caught Catherine by the back of the neck, wrapped his other hand around the top of her head, and twisted.\n The pale eyes rolled up. For the second time that night the metal strut rang against the tile as it fell from fingers suddenly slack.\n Tossing the body aside, Henry threw himself to his knees, his hands joining Celluci\u0027s as they frantically searched for the wounds below Vicki\u0027s blood-soaked clothing.\n The iron bar had torn a chunk of flesh from her left shoulder and had scored the right side of her ribs in two places. Ugly wounds, all three, but hardly fatal.\n Then they lifted her fingers out of the puddle between hip and thigh.\n \"Jesus!\" Henry pressed his hand down on the spot and met Celluci\u0027s wild gaze. \"Arterial,\" he said quietly and strained to hear her heart above the painful pounding of his own.\n The blood spattered across the flashlight lens made Rorschach patterns on the ceiling.\n Number nine lay, head to one side as she had left him, waiting for her to come back.\n And then she was there.\n But she didn\u0027t see him and she didn\u0027t smile.\n \"Fifteen minutes. It takes fifteen minutes to bleed to death from that kind of wound.\"\n \"I know that!\" Henry snapped. He had her heartbeat now, but it was frighteningly faint.\n \"Of course you do.\" His ringers trembling, Celluci looped the arm of her glasses back over the curve of her ear. \"You\u0027re a fucking vampire. You know bleeding. So do something about it!\"\n Henry glared at him. There was no way to do a tourniquet in the joining of torso and leg. No way but direct pressure to stop the bleeding and he was already doing that, even if he did it too late. \"Do what?\" he demanded, sure there was nothing else he could do.\n \"How the fuck should I know! You\u0027re the fucking... Jesus!\"\n Pulled by the intensity of Celluci\u0027s terrified stare, Henry twisted around. Across the lab, by the wall of boarded up windows, one of the bodies rose slowly to its feet.\n One of them had killed her.\n Killed her dead.\n The anger number nine had known before was less than nothing in comparison to what he felt now.\n My gun? Where the hell is my gun? Swatting aside panic, Celluci scanned the floor and finally spotted it almost under the cavader\u0027s feet. Fucking great...\n Scrambling to his feet, he launched himself forward, dove, got both hands around the weapon, rolled, and pulled the trigger at almost point-blank range.\n The bullet plowed through the putrefying tissue with almost no loss of velocity and rang against the brass casing of the oxygen tank directly behind. It ricocheted up the curve, hit the next tank, and sprayed bits of the valve across the room. Oxygen began to hiss free.\n \"Jesus H. Christ!\" Still on the floor, Celluci crabbed back. Although pus and fluid and God-knew-what poured from the hole, the dead man continued to shuffle forward. \"What the fuck do you think this is? A fucking James Cameron movie?\" His hands were shaking too hard to try a head shot. He watched his second round blow a chunk from the outside curve of the thing\u0027s thigh without any noticeable effect. \"God-damnit, stay dead!\"\n The third round passed through the abdomen again, rang against brass and sparked.\n All hell broke loose.\n Henry threw himself over Vicki.\n Celluci flattened.\n The explosion sent chunks of the oxygen tank flying through the air like shrapnel. Several of the larger chunks slammed into number nine, cutting him into pieces.\n He remembered dying.\n The last time, she had been there when it was over.\n He hoped she\u0027d be there again.\n With a whoosh, the alcohol vapor in the air ignited, then the alcohol, then the desk.\n Then the emergency light shut off.\n Celluci picked his way back to Vicki\u0027s side. \"Fucking place is on fire. At least we can still see.\" He squinted at Henry, the pale skin of the vampire\u0027s face and chest just barely visible in the flickering light. \"You okay?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Vicki?\"\n Henry hesitated, praying he\u0027d hear something different, knowing he wouldn\u0027t. \"She\u0027s dying.\"\n \"Fuck that!\" Ripping off jacket and shoulder holster, Celluci yanked his shirt over his head, ignoring the buttons. Folding most of the fabric into a rough pad, sleeves dangling, he shoved it at Henry. \"She said your saliva causes clotting.\"\n \"Yes, but... \"\n \"Spit on this and tie that wound off. We\u0027re practically on top of a fucking hospital. You get the bleeding stopped and we move her.\"\n \"It\u0027s too... \"\n \"Do it!\"\n Although he knew it would make no difference, Henry took the shirt and bent over the jagged hole. Michael Celluci had lived less than forty years and still thought death could be fought. Four and a half centuries had taught a different lesson. In a battle between love and death, death always won. He could feel Vicki\u0027s life ebbing, knew that nothing they could do would change that.\n His fingers maintaining pressure, he covered the still bleeding gash with his mouth. At least when she died, he would have contact with her blood. He pulled the touch, the taste, the scent of her into memory. You are mortal, my love. I always knew you\u0027d die, but I never dreamed we\u0027d have so little time...\n Suddenly, Celluci\u0027s fingers were in his hair and the contact broken.\n \"I said wrap it, Goddamnit. Not fucking take what she has left!\"\n Henry drew bloodstained lips back off his teeth. \"Get your hands off me, mortal!\"\n The explosion had jerked Vicki back out of the twilight zone of pain and darkness she\u0027d sunk into. She hadn\u0027t thought it was possible to hurt so much and still be alive. She could hear the two men arguing and fought against the weight hanging from her tongue.\n \"Mi... \"\n \"Vicki?\" Henry forgotten in the sound of her voice, Celluci twisted around and cupped her face in his hands. The fire licked at the plywood over the windows. Celluci ignored it. The high ceiling drew the smoke up and away. The path to the door remained clear. As long as the fire posed no immediate danger, it could be ignored for more important concerns. The highly polished metal of the isolation box reflected the orange glow of the flames out into the room. In its light, Celluci saw Vicki\u0027s eyelids flicker, once, twice. \"Hang on, we\u0027re going to get you to the hospital.\"\n The hospital? She wanted to tell him there wasn\u0027t any point but couldn\u0027t figure out how.\n \"Michael.\" The pain in the detective\u0027s voice damped Henry\u0027s anger and drew his own grief to the fore. With one hand still foolishly, hopelessly holding pressure on Vicki\u0027s leg, he gently grasped Celluci\u0027s shoulder with the other. \"There isn\u0027t enough time.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"She\u0027ll be dead even before you get her out of this building.\"\n \"No!\"\n \"I can feel her life ebbing.\"\n \"I said, NO!\"\n Listen to him, Mike. He\u0027s right. She thought she was still breathing but she couldn\u0027t be certain. I\u0027m still here, I must be breathing.\n \"Damn it, Vicki, don\u0027t die!\"\n Oh, God, Mike, don\u0027t cry. She\u0027d thought it couldn\u0027t hurt anymore. She\u0027d been wrong.\n \"There has to be something we can do!\"\n Henry felt a vise close round his heart and squeeze. \"No.\" One word, two letters, somehow carried all he felt.\n Pulled by the sound of suffering as great as his own, Celluci looked up and met hazel eyes washed almost gold by the firelight. They held a truth too bitter to deny. Vicki was dying.\n I\u0027m cold. And it\u0027s dark. And it isn\u0027t fair. I could tell you I love you now. Could tell both of you. Love was enough to bring my mother back. I guess I\u0027m not as strong. Her body didn\u0027t seem to be a part of her anymore. The flesh wrapped around her like a badly fitting suit of clothes. Oh, shit. I can\u0027t feel anything. This sucks. This really sucks. I DON\u0027T WANT TO DIE!\n Her eyes snapped open. She could see a familiar shadow bending over her. Her fingers trembled, aching to brush the curl of hair back from his face.\n \"Vicki?\"\n She pulled enough strength from him to form a single word. \"Hen... ry.\"\n The name pierced into Celluci\u0027s soul and ripped it to shreds with barbed hooks. She wanted Henry. Not him. Wanted to die in Henry\u0027s arms. He bit his lip to keep from crying out and tried to jerk his head away. He couldn\u0027t. Something in her eyes held him. Something that insisted he understand.\n She saw the sudden white slash of his smile and carried it with her into darkness. She\u0027d done what she could. Now it was up to him.\n Henry had heard his name and was bending forward when Celluci lifted his head. He froze. He\u0027d expected to see on the other man\u0027s face the pain of Vicki\u0027s choice written over the pain of her dying. He hadn\u0027t expected to see a wild and insane hope.\n \"Change her!\"\n Henry felt his jaw drop. \"What?\"\n \"You heard me!\" Celluci reached across Vicki\u0027s body and grabbed a fistful of leather coat. \"Change her!\"\n Change her. He\u0027d fed from her deeply only a short time before. And fed from her the night before that. His blood held enough of the elements of hers that her system might accept it, especially as she had so little blood of her own left to replace. But considering his condition, did he have enough for them both?\n Change her. If he changed her, he\u0027d lose her. They\u0027d have a little over a year but no more before her new nature drove them apart.\n \"Do it,\" Celluci begged. \"It\u0027s her only chance.\"\n Henry suddenly realized that Celluci had no idea of what the change would mean. That he, in fact, believed the exact opposite of the truth. Believed that if Vicki changed she was lost to him. Henry could read the knowledge of that loss in the other man\u0027s face. Could read how he was willing to surrender everything to another for Vicki\u0027s sake.\n You think I\u0027ve won, mortal. You\u0027re so very wrong. If she dies, we both lose her. If she changes, I lose her alone.\n \"Henry. Please.\"\n And if you can give her up for love, wondered Henry Fitzroy, vampire, bastard son of Henry VIII, can I do any less? His heart would allow only one answer.\n Lifting his own wrist to his mouth, Henry opened a vein. \"It might not work,\" he said as he pressed this smaller wound into the hole in her leg, forcing the flow of his blood to act as a barrier for hers. A moment later, he lifted his arm and threw Celluci back his shirt, the motion flinging a single crimson drop across the room like a discarded ruby. \"Bind it. Tightly. This could still kill her in spite of everything I do.\"\n Celluci did as instructed, lifting his eyes in time to see Henry open a vein over his heart with Vicki\u0027s Swiss army knife. Even with so prosaic a tool, it held the shadow of ancient ritual and he watched, unable to look away, as blood welled out of the cut, appearing almost black against the alabaster skin.\n Sliding his arm behind Vicki\u0027s shoulders, Henry lifted her and pressed her mouth to his breast. Her life had dropped away to a murmur in the distance; not dead, not yet, but very, very close.\n \"Drink, Vicki.\" He made it a command, threw all he was into it, breathed it against the soft cap of her hair. \"Drink to live.\"\n He was afraid for a moment that she could not obey him even if she wanted to; then her lips parted and she swallowed. The intensity of his reaction took him completely by surprise. He could vaguely remember how it had felt when Christina had fed from him. It was in no way comparable to the near ecstasy he felt now. He swayed, wrapped his other arm around her body, and closed his eyes. This rapture wasn\u0027t enough to make up for the eventual loss of her, but, by God, it was close.\n Celluci tied off the makeshift pressure bandage, his hands operating independently of conscious direction. There was something both so blatantly sensual and so extraordinarily innocent about the scene that he couldn\u0027t have looked away had he wanted to. Not that he wanted to. He wanted every second of Vicki he could have before he had to face the rest of his life without her.\n The firelight turned Vicki\u0027s hair the color of spilled honey, danced orange highlights down the black leather enveloping her, and reflected crimson in the puddles of her blood spilled on the floor.\n Jesus H. Christ! The fire! All at once, as though it had been waiting to be remembered, he could feel the heat licking against his back. He turned. The entire wall of boarded windows was aflame. The smoke had a greenish tinge and an unpleasant taste, spilled chemicals or burning plastic, it was irrelevant at the moment. They had to get out.\n \"Fitzroy!\"\n The voice seemed to come from a long way away, but it held an urgency difficult to ignore. Henry opened his eyes.\n \"We\u0027ve got to get out of here before this whole place goes up! Can you move her?\"\n It took a moment for Henry\u0027s eyes to clear, but gradually he, too, became aware of the danger. He glanced down at Vicki, still nuzzling like a blind kitten at his breast, and pulled free enough to find his voice. \"I\u0027ve never done this before, Detective.\" He had no energy left for anything but the truth and the touch of her life was still so tenuous. \"She\u0027s dying slower than she was, but she\u0027s still dying.\"\n \"Christ! What more will it take!\"\n \"More, I\u0027m afraid, than I have right now to give.\" He swayed, Vicki\u0027s head rising and falling with the motion. \"I told you it might not work.\"\n Fucking great. Vicki was still dying, Fitzroy looked like hell, and the building was burning down around them. He coughed and scrubbed his forearm across his face. God-damned cup\u0027s not half empty if I say it\u0027s half full. Grabbing jacket and holster and gun up off the floor, Celluci stood. \"If she\u0027s still dying, she\u0027s not dead. Let\u0027s try to keep it that way. Come on!\"\n Shifting his grip, cradling Vicki in his arms as though she were a child, Henry tried to stand. The room tilted.\n Eyes streaming from the smoke, Celluci shoved his free hand into a leather-covered armpit and helped heave Henry and his burden off the floor. \"Can you hold her?\"\n \"Yes.\" He didn\u0027t actually think he could let her go but he didn\u0027t have enough strength for the explanation. Henry leaned on the larger man\u0027s strength as his knees threatened to buckle and, together, they staggered toward the door. Unable to see where he was placing his feet, he stumbled over a piece of something wet he didn\u0027t want to know what, and nearly fell.\n \"Oh, no, you don\u0027t.\" Muscles popping, sweat streaming down his chest, Celluci somehow kept all three of them up and moving. \"After everything we\u0027ve been through tonight, we aren\u0027t fucking quitting yet.\"\n Arms locked around Vicki, holding her life with his own, Henry dredged up the ghost of a smile. \"Never say die, Detective?\"\n Celluci tossed the curl of hair back off his face and led the way out of the lab. \"Fucking right,\" he growled.\n As they disappeared down the hall, the door to the storeroom slowly swung open and, coughing, Dr. Burke stumbled out into the lab.\n \"Now that,\" she declared, \"was a most edi... fying evening. Who says eaves... droppers never hear anything good?\" She wiped her streaming eyes and nose on her sleeve and picked her way carefully through the smoke and debris toward the door.\n From the sound of it, Marjory Nelson\u0027s daughter and her companions had problems of their own. Problems that could easily be used to convince them that Dr. Aline Burke might be better left alone, that her involvement in this whole sordid affair was nothing more than chance.\n Donald was dead. She didn\u0027t want Donald to be dead, but upon consideration there wasn\u0027t anything she could do about it. Why should she suffer just because Donald was dead?\n Catherine was dead, too, and therefore a convenient, nonprotesting scapegoat.\n \"I had no idea what was going on, your honor.\" She started to giggle and gagged instead. Whatever chemicals were burning were undeniably toxic. \"Go ahead, burn!\" she commanded. \"Let\u0027s give Catherine and her friends a fine Viking send-off and in the pro-shess... \" A fit of coughing doubled her over. She staggered to the isolation box and sagged against it, stomach heaving.\n \"And in the proshess,\" she repeated when she\u0027d caught her breath and swallowed a mouthful of bile, \"destroy as much evidence as possible. A little vampiric blackmail, a little-what\u0027s the word?-con... fla... gration and I\u0027ll be out of this with no major career damage done.\" Her flame-bordered reflection appeared smugly satisfied and she smiled down at it, patting herself on the cheek. The box was becoming warm to the touch and the skin of her face and hands was beginning to tighten in the growing heat. Time to go.\n Head lowered to avoid the worst of the smoke now billowing down from the ceiling, coughing almost continually, she started for the door, lifting her feet with alcohol exaggerated caution over bodies and parts of bodies.\n Then she spotted the disk. Spilled half out of Catherine\u0027s lab coat pocket, very blue against the bloodstained white, it could contain only one thing: the copies of the tests made that afternoon on the vampire. What else would be important enough for Catherine to carry around with her?\n Only this afternoon. Seems so long ago. With one hand resting against the end of the isolation box, her balance not being exactly stable, Dr. Burke bent to pick it up. It didn\u0027t seem to be damaged. Having been sheltered in the curve of Catherine\u0027s body, it didn\u0027t even seem to be very hot. She shoved it into her own pocket, suddenly realizing that not only would she come out of this with her career essentially undamaged, but with information the scientific community would award high honors for.\n A few simple experiments, she thought, grinning broadly, and that Nobel prize is...\n One of the oxygen tanks had remained amazingly undamaged after the earlier explosion had flung it out into the lab. It had lain, partially under the far side of the isolation box, safely away from the main heat of the fire. But temperatures were rising. The plastic valve finally began to melt. The metal collar below it expanded a very, very small amount. It was enough.\n The blast slammed Dr. Burke to the floor where she watched in horror as a giant, invisible hand lifted the isolation box and dropped it to fall, impossibly slowly, across her legs. She heard bones shatter, felt the pain a moment later, and slid into darkness.\n When the light returned, it was the orange-red of the approaching fire and almost no time had passed. She couldn\u0027t feel what was left of her legs.\n \"That\u0027s all right. Don\u0027t need legs.\"\n Catherine\u0027s extended hand had begun to sizzle.\n \"Don\u0027t need legs. Need to get out of here.\" The isolation box was on its side. The curve would give her a little room. If she could just push against it, she could pull her legs free and crawl out of the room. Crawl away from the flames. She didn\u0027t need legs.\n Dragging herself up into a sitting position, she shoved at the box. Nestled on an uneven surface, it rocked. Something squelched beneath it but that didn\u0027t matter.\n The flames were licking at the sleeve of Catherine\u0027s lab coat. Over the stink of chemical-laden smoke, came the smell of roasting pork.\n Swallowing saliva, she pounded at the box.\n It rocked again.\n The latch that number nine had partially turned, gave way.\n The lid fell open, knocking Dr. Burke back to the floor as it rose into the air on silent hinges, spilling the body thrown up against it by the explosion out onto her lap.\n The naked, empty shell of Donald Li rolled once and came to rest in the circle of her arms, his head tucked back so that it seemed his face stared up into hers.\n The flames stopped the screaming when they finally came.\n \"Christ on crutches!\" Detective Fergusson ducked behind his car as the explosion flung pieces of burning wood and heated metal out into the street. \"Next time I investigate drunken confessions in the fucking morning!\" Snatching up his radio, he ignored the panicked shouts of the approaching security guards and called in the fire with a calm professionalism he was far from feeling.\n \"... and an ambulance!\"\n He thought he could hear screaming. He hoped like hell he was wrong.\n \"Now what.\"\n \"It\u0027s just after two. I need to feed. In about an hour, if she\u0027s still alive, I need to feed her. And then I need to get her back to Toronto before dawn.\"\n \"Why Toronto? Why can\u0027t she just stay here?\"\n Henry sank down onto the end of the bed. His head felt almost too heavy to lift. \"Because if she changes, I need to have her in a place I know is secure.\" He waved a weary, bloodstained arm at the apartment. \"This isn\u0027t. And if she... if she... \"\n \"Dies,\" Celluci said emotionlessly, staring down at Vicki\u0027s unconscious form. He felt as though the world had skewed a few degrees sideways and he had no choice but to try to keep his balance on the slope.\n \"Yes.\" Henry matched the detective\u0027s lack of expression. If the facade cracked now, it would sweep them all away. \"If she dies, I\u0027ll need to dispose of the body. I\u0027ll need to be in a city I know in order to do that.\"\n \"Dispose of the body?\"\n \"Her death is going to be a little difficult to explain if I don\u0027t, don\u0027t you think? There\u0027ll be an autopsy, an inquest, and questions you don\u0027t have the answer to will be asked.\"\n \"So she just disappears... \"\n \"Yes. Yet another unsolved mystery.\"\n \"And I\u0027ll have to act as though I have no idea if she\u0027s dead or alive.\"\n Henry lifted his head and allowed a hint of power to touch his voice. \"Mourn her as dead, Detective.\"\n Celluci didn\u0027t bother to pretend that he misunderstood. He jerked his gaze from Vicki and recklessly met the vampire\u0027s eyes. \"Mourn her regardless? Fuck you. You tell me what happens, Fitzroy. If she disappears because she\u0027s dead, I\u0027ll mourn her. If she disappears into the night with you, I\u0027ll... \" A muscle jumped in his jaw. \"I\u0027ll miss her like I\u0027d miss a part of myself but I won\u0027t mourn her if she isn\u0027t any more dead than you are.\"\n Since they\u0027d found her dying in the lab, Henry had been measuring time by Vicki\u0027s heartbeat. He let three go by while he studied Mike Celluci\u0027s soul. \"You really mean that,\" he said at last. He found it difficult to believe. Found it impossible not to believe.\n \"Yeah.\" The word caught in Celluci\u0027s throat. \"I really mean it.\" He swallowed and fought for control. Then his eyes widened. \"What do you mean, you have to feed?\"\n \"You should know what that means by now.\"\n \"On who?\"\n \"I could hunt.\" Except that he was so incredibly tired. The night had already lasted longer than any night he could remember. It seemed a pity to hunt when there was... He allowed the power to rise a little more.\n \"Stop it. I know what you\u0027re trying.\" With an effort, Celluci wrenched his gaze away and back to the woman on the bed. She was still alive. All that really mattered was keeping her that way. He\u0027d made that decision back in the lab. He\u0027d stand by it now. \"If it includes anything but sucking blood, you can fucking well order takeout.\"\n Astounded by the offer, Henry felt his brows rise. \"It needn\u0027t include anything but sucking blood, Detective. It\u0027s not nourishment I need so much as refueling.\"\n \"All right, then.\" Celluci shrugged out of his jacket, dropping it carefully inside out so as not to stain the carpet, and began to roll up his sleeve. \"Wrist, right?\"\n \"Yes.\" Henry shook his head, wonder and respect about equally mixed in his voice. \"You know, in four and a half centuries, I\u0027ve never met a man quite like you. In spite of everything, you offer me your blood?\"\n \"Yeah. In spite of everything.\" With one last look at Vicki, he turned and lowered himself onto the end of the bed. \"At the risk of offending, after what went down tonight,\" he sighed, \"this doesn\u0027t seem like much. Besides, I\u0027m doing it for her. Right now, as far as I\u0027m concerned, you\u0027re just a primitive branch of the Red Cross. Get on with it.\"\n Henry lifted the offered arm, then looked up at Celluci, his eyes dark, the smallest hint of a smile brushing against the outside corners of his lips. \"You know, it\u0027s a shame there\u0027s so much between us, Detective.\"\n Celluci felt the heat and tossed the curl of hair back off his forehead. \"Don\u0027t press your luck, you undead son of a bitch.\"\n As he carried her out the door, her life still balanced on the razor\u0027s edge, Henry paused. \"Doesn\u0027t it gnaw at you,\" he asked at last, unable to leave with knowing, \"that at the end she chose me?\"\n Celluci reached out and gently tucked her glasses into the pocket of her coat. Her purse and her suitcase had already been loaded in Henry\u0027s car.\n \"She didn\u0027t choose you,\" he said, stepping back and rubbing at the bandage on his wrist. \"She chose the one chance she had to live. I refuse to feel bad about that.\"\n \"She could still die.\"\n \"See that she doesn\u0027t.\"\n A thousand thoughts between one faltering heartbeat and the next. \"I\u0027ll do my best.\"\n Celluci nodded, acknowledging truth; then he bent forward and kissed her gently on lips that felt less warm than they had.\n \"Good-bye, Vicki.\"\n And there wasn\u0027t anything more he could say.\n He dealt with Detective Fergusson. Explained Vicki had had a bit of a breakdown, perfectly understandable under the circumstances, and gone back to Toronto with a friend. \"I\u0027ll let her know what happened... \"\n He dealt with the contents of her mother\u0027s apartment, calling an estate auctioneer and putting everything in his hands. \"Just sell it. The money goes to the lawyer until the will clears probate, so what\u0027s the problem.\"\n He dealt with Mr. Delgado.\n \"I saw her leave in his car; through my window.\" The old man looked up at him and shook his head. \"What happened?\"\n Just for a moment, Celluci wanted to tell him, just for a moment, because he desperately needed to tell somebody. Fortunately, the moment passed. \"There\u0027s an old saying, Mr. Delgado, \u0027if you love something, let it go.\u0027\"\n \"I know this saying. I read it on a T-shirt once. It\u0027s bullshit, if you\u0027ll excuse my language.\" His head continued to shake like it was the only moving part of an ancient clockwork. \"So she made her choice.\"\n \"We all made a choice.\"\n He dealt with driving back to Toronto not knowing. He wouldn\u0027t call Fitzroy. He\u0027d bent as far as he could. Let Fitzroy call him.\n He dealt with the message when it finally came and thanked God he only had to deal with Fitzroy\u0027s voice on the machine. Even that was disturbing enough. He tried to be happy she was still alive. Tried very hard. Almost managed it.\n He found out what was happening next by accident. He hadn\u0027t intended to walk by her apartment. It was stupid. Ghoulish. He knew she wasn\u0027t there. He\u0027d gone in once, the night he\u0027d arrived from Kingston, cleared out his stuff, and without knowing why, had taken a picture of the two of them that he hated off her dresser. When he got home, he shoved it up on the shelf in his hall closet and never looked at it again. But he had it.\n \"Hey, Sarge.\" A slender shadow detached itself from the broad base of the old chestnut tree and sauntered out onto the sidewalk. \"There\u0027s no point in going in, her stuff\u0027s all gone. New tenants coming next week, I expect.\"\n \"What are you doing here, Tony?\"\n The young man shrugged. \"I was dropping off the key and I saw you coming around the corner, so I figured I\u0027d wait. Save me a trip later. I got a message for you.\"\n \"A message,\" he repeated, because he couldn\u0027t ask who from.\n \"Yeah. Henry said I was to tell you that you were one of the most honorable men he ever met and that he wished things could\u0027ve been different.\"\n \"Different. Yeah. Well.\"\n Tony shot the detective a glance out of the corner of his eye and hid his disappointment. Henry wouldn\u0027t tell him what he meant by different, if he meant with Vicki or what, and now it looked like Celluci was going to be just as close-mouthed. Although he\u0027d been given the overall story behind that last night in Kingston, he had none of the details and curiosity was almost killing him. \"Henry also wanted me to tell you that a year is a small slice of eternity.\"\n Celluci snorted and started walking down Huron Street, needing the distraction of movement. \"What the hell does that mean?\" he asked as Tony fell into step beside him.\n \"Beats me,\" Tony admitted. \"But that\u0027s what he wanted me to tell you. He said you\u0027d understand later.\"\n Celluci snorted again. \"Fucking romance writer.\"\n \"Yeah. Well.\" When they reached the corner at Cecil Street, and the detective hadn\u0027t spoke again, Tony sighed. \"Mostly she sleeps,\" he said.\n \"Who sleeps?\" A muscle jumped in Celluci\u0027s jaw.\n \"Victory. Henry\u0027s still pretty worried about her, but he thinks things are going to be all right now that the hole in her leg finally healed up. We\u0027re moving to Vancouver.\"\n \"We?\"\n \"Yeah. She\u0027s pretty helpless right now. They need someone who can deal with the sun. And... \"\n \"Never mind.\" Vancouver. All the way across the country. \"Why? For the sea air?\"\n \"Nah. So nobody recognizes her when she starts to hunt. Apparently they\u0027re pretty messy at first.\"\n They\u0027d eaten a thousand meals together. Maybe two thousand. \"Tell him she\u0027s not likely to get a lot neater.\"\n Tony snickered. \"I\u0027ll tell him. Anything you want me to tell her?\"\n \"Tell her... \" His voice trailed off and he seemed to be staring at something Tony couldn\u0027t see. Then his face twisted and, lips pressed into a thin, white line, he spun on one heel and strode away.\n Tony stood and watched him for a moment, then he nodded. \"Don\u0027t worry, man,\" he said softly. \"I\u0027ll tell her.\"\n He dealt with everything until Detective Fergusson called from Kingston about the inquest.\n \"Look, she\u0027s moved to Vancouver, all right. Other than that, I don\u0027t know where the fuck she is.\"\n Detective Fergusson jumped to the obvious conclusion. \"Dumped you, eh?\"\n In answer, Celluci ripped the phone off his kitchen wall and threw it out the back door. A few days later, after he\u0027d been brought in by a couple of uniforms for racing a jet down the runway at the Downsview Airport, the backseat of his car rattling with empties, the police psychologist suggested that he was suppressing strong emotions.\n Still painfully hung over, Celluci barely resisted the urge to suppress the police psychologist.\n \"I hope she\u0027s worth you flushing your career down the toilet, because that\u0027s what you\u0027re doing.\" Inspector Cantree\u0027s chair screeched a protest as he leaned back and glared at Celluci. \"You know what I\u0027ve got here?\" One huge hand slapped down on the file folder centered on his blotter. \"Never mind. I\u0027ll tell you. I\u0027ve got a report from the department shrink that suggests you\u0027re dangerously unstable and that you shouldn\u0027t be allowed out on the street carrying a gun.\"\n Lips compressed into a thin, white line, Celluci started to shrug out of his shoulder holster.\n \"Put that the fuck back on!\" Cantree snapped. \"If I was going to listen to the pompous quack, I\u0027d have had your badge days ago.\"\n Celluci shoved the curl of hair back off his face and tried to ignore how much the motion reminded him of her. \"I\u0027m fine,\" he growled.\n \"Bullshit! You want to tell me what\u0027s wrong?\"\n \"Nothing\u0027s wrong.\" His tone dared Cantree to argue the point and Cantree\u0027s expression did just that. Celluci had heard the rumors making the rounds about ex-Detective Vicki Nelson\u0027s hasty relocation to the West Coast, although he\u0027d heard them second or third hand because no one had the guts to speculate to his face. Obviously, Cantree had heard them, too. \"It\u0027s personal.\"\n \"Not when it affects your job, it isn\u0027t.\" The Inspector leaned forward and held Celluci\u0027s gaze with his. \"So here\u0027s what you\u0027re going to do. You\u0027re going to take a leave of absence for at least a month and you\u0027re going to get out of the city and you\u0027re going to find wherever it is you\u0027ve left your brains and then you\u0027re going to come back and have another little talk with Dr. Freud-enstein.\"\n \"What if I don\u0027t want to go?\" Celluci muttered.\n Cantree smiled. \"If you don\u0027t take a leave of absence, I\u0027ll suspend you for a month without pay. Either way, you\u0027re out of here.\"\n Betting in headquarters had three to one odds that Mike Celluci\u0027s leave of absence would begin on the first available flight to Vancouver. Several people lost some serious money.\n A week after the interview in Cantree\u0027s office, Celluci found himself escorting his ancient grandmother onto a plane bound for Italy and a family reunion.\n \"Jesus, Mike it\u0027s good to have you back.\" Dave Graham\u0027s grin threatened to dislodge the entire lower half of his face. \"I mean, one more temporary partner like the last one and I\u0027d have taken six weeks off.\"\n \"Who the fuck left coffee rings all over my desk!\"\n \"On the other hand,\" Dave continued thoughtfully was Celluci began accusing coworkers of messing with his stuff, \"it was a lot quieter while you were gone.\"\n \"You buying one of those, Mike?\"\n \"What?\" Celluci looked up from the paperback book display and scowled at his partner.\n \"Well, you\u0027ve been staring at it for the last five minutes. I thought that maybe you were in the mood for a little light reading.\" Dave reached past his head at the blond giant cradling a half-naked brunette on the cover. \"Sail into Destiny by Elizabeth Fitzroy. Looks like a winner. You think you know a guy... \" He flipped the book over \"... think you know his tastes, and then you find out about something like this. You figure Captain Roxborough and this Veronica babe are going to get together in the end or is that a given?\"\n \"Jesus H. Christ, we\u0027re in a mall! Someone might see you.\" Celluci grabbed the book and shoved it back on the shelf.\n \"Hey, you were the one who stopped to browse,\" Dave protested as the two detectives started walking again. \"You were the one... \"\n \"I know the author, all right? Now drop it.\"\n \"You know an author? I didn\u0027t even think you knew how to read.\" They watched a crowd of teenage boys saunter past and into a sports store. \"So what\u0027s she like? Does she live in Toronto?\"\n He\u0027s a vampire. He lives in Vancouver. \"I said, drop it.\"\n There were bits of Vicki scattered all over the city and whenever he ran into one, her old neighborhood, her favorite coffee shop, a hooker she\u0027d busted, it gouged the scabs off his ability to cope. Now, he was finding bits of Fitzroy as well and every copy of the book he saw ground salt into the wounds. Fortunately, he\u0027d gotten better at hiding the pain.\n He\u0027d even convinced the police psychologist that he was fine.\n \"... and the Stanley Park murders continue in Vancouver. Another known drug dealer has been found by the teahouse at Ferguson Point. As in the three previous cases, the head appears to have been ripped from the body and sources in the Coroner\u0027s Office report that, once again, the body has been drained of blood.\"\n Celluci\u0027s grip tightened around the aluminum beer can, crushing the thin metal. His attention locked on the television, he didn\u0027t notice the liquid dripping over his hand and onto the carpet.\n \"The police remain baffled and one of the officers staking out the teahouse during the time the murder occurred freely admitted having seen nothing. Speculation in the press ranges from the likelihood of a powerful new gang arriving in the Vancouver area and removing competition, to the possibility of an enraged sasquatch roaming the park.\n \"In Edmonton... \"\n Drained of blood. Celluci shut off the sound and stared unblinkingly at the CBC news anchor who silently continued the National without him. Not a sasquatch. A vampire. A new, young vampire learning to feed. Rip off the heads to hide the first frenzied teeth marks. Fitzroy was strong enough. Leave dead drug dealers in the park to make a point. He could see Vicki all over that.\n \"God-damned vampire vigilantes,\" he muttered through teeth clenched so tightly his temples ached. Back before Fitzroy, Vicki had realized that law was one of the few concepts holding chaos at bay. As much as she might have wanted to behead a few of the cock-roaches that walked on two legs in the city\u0027s gutters, she\u0027d never have taken matters into her own hands. Fitzroy had changed that even before he\u0027d changed her.\n Vicki was alive, but what had she become? And why didn\u0027t he care?\n Celluci didn\u0027t want to face the answer to either question. The TV continued to flicker silently in the corner as he cracked open a bottle of Scotch and methodically set about searching for oblivion.\n Time passed but only because there was nothing to stop it.\n She stood outside for a while and watched his shadow move against the blinds. There was a tightness in her chest and, if she didn\u0027t know herself better, she\u0027d say she was frightened. \"Which is ridiculous.\"\n Wiping her palms against the thighs of her jeans, the movement dictated no longer by need but by habit, she started up the driveway. Waiting would only make it worse.\n Her knock, harder than she\u0027d intended for she still didn\u0027t have complete control of her strength, echoed up and down the quiet street. She listened to him approach the door, counted his heartbeats as he turned the knob, and tried not to flinch back from the sudden spill of light.\n \"Vicki.\"\n She felt as though she hadn\u0027t heard her name spoken for a very long time and couldn\u0027t hear his reaction over the sound of her own. With an effort, she kept her voice more or less even. \"You don\u0027t seem especially surprised to see me.\"\n \"I heard about what happened last night to Gowan and Mallard.\"\n \"No more than they deserved. No more than I owed them.\"\n \"The paper says they\u0027ll both live.\"\n The night flashed for an instant in her smile. \"Good. I want them to live with it.\" She rubbed her palms against her jeans again, this time wiping clean old debts. \"Can I come in?\"\n Celluci stepped back from the door. She was thinner, paler, and her hair was different. It took a moment for the most obvious change to sink in.\n \"Your glasses?\"\n \"I don\u0027t need them anymore.\" This smile was the smile he remembered. \"Good thing, too.\"\n Closing the door behind her, he felt like an amputee who\u0027d woken up to find his legs had grown back. He couldn\u0027t seem to catch his breath and it took a moment to identify the strange sense of loss he was feeling with an absence of pain. He almost heard the click as the piece that had been gouged from his life slid back into place.\n \"You know the potential problems with the RP never even occurred to me that night in the lab,\" she continued, leading the way into the kitchen. \"Can you imagine a vampire with no night sight? Biting by braille, God, what a mess that would be.\"\n \"You\u0027re babbling,\" he said shortly as she turned to face him.\n \"I know. Sorry.\"\n They stared at each other for a long moment and a number of things that needed to be said were discussed in the silence.\n \"Henry owes you an apology,\" Vicki told him at last. \"He never mentioned to you that vampires can\u0027t stay together after the change is complete.\"\n \"It\u0027s been fourteen months.\"\n She spread her hands. \"Sorry. I got off to a slow start.\"\n Celluci frowned. \"I\u0027m not sure I understand. You can\u0027t ever see him again?\"\n \"He says I won\u0027t want to. That we won\u0027t want to.\"\n \"The bastard could\u0027ve told me.\" He dragged a hand up through his hair. \"Henry wanted me to tell you that a year is a small slice of eternity.\" Taking a deep breath, he wondered what he would\u0027ve done had their positions been reversed. \"Never mind. Henry doesn\u0027t owe me anything. And the son of a bitch already apologized.\"\n Vicki looked doubtful. \"Yeah? Well, I\u0027m not buying into his tragic separation bullshit even if we can\u0027t share a territory.\" Brave words, but she wasn\u0027t so sure that they meant anything, that her new nature would allow a bond to remain without the blood.\n \"I\u0027m not giving you up without a fight.\"\n Henry turned away from the lights of a new city and sadly shook his head. \"You\u0027ll be fighting yourself, Vicki. Fighting what you are. What we are.\"\n \"So ?\" Her chin rose. \"I don\u0027t surrender, Henry. Not to anything.\"\n \"He\u0027s got a cellular phone and he just bought a fax machine, for chrissake; I think we\u0027ll manage to stay in touch.\"\n \"Really?\" Celluci propped one hip on the counter and crossed his arms over his chest. \"You never called me.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t able to until just recently, things were a little chaotic at first. And then... \" She rubbed a pale finger along the edge of his kitchen table, glad she\u0027d lost the ability to blush. \"And then, I was afraid.\"\n He\u0027d never heard her admit to being afraid of anything before. \"Afraid of what?\"\n She looked up and he found his answer in the desperate question in her eyes.\n \"Vicki... \" He made her name a gentle accusation. Couldn\u0027t you trust me ?\n \"Well, I\u0027m different now and... What are you laughing at?\"\n How long had it been since he laughed like that? About fourteen months, he suspected. \"If that\u0027s all you\u0027re worried about; Vicki, you\u0027ve always been different.\"\n The question faded, replaced by hope. \"So you don\u0027t mind?\"\n \"I\u0027d be lying if I said it won\u0027t take getting used to, but, no, I don\u0027t mind.\" Mind? There wasn\u0027t much he couldn\u0027t get used to if it meant having her back beside him.\n \"It won\u0027t be the same.\"\n \"No shit.\"\n \"Henry says it can be better.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care what Henry says.\"\n \"It won\u0027t be settling down and raising a family like you wanted.\"\n He slid off the counter. \"Don\u0027t tell me what I wanted. I wanted you.\"\n She opened her arms, her teeth a very white invitation against the curve of her mouth.\n He met her halfway.\n They hit the floor together.\n Two hours and twenty-three minutes later, Vicki pillowed her head on his shoulder and stared up at the kitchen ceiling. She\u0027d thought that over the last fourteen months she\u0027d come to terms with what she\u0027d become, vampire, child of darkness, nightwalker, but she hadn\u0027t, not really, not until her teeth had met through a fold of Mike Celluci\u0027s skin and she\u0027d drawn his life back into hers. She licked at a drop of sweat and could feel his breath, warm against the top of her head, his scent wrapped around her.\n \"What\u0027re you thinking of?\" he asked sleepily.\n Vampire. Child of Darkness. Nightwalker.\n Reaching up, she brushed the curl of hair back off his forehead and smiled. \"I was just thinking about the next four hundred and fifty years.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-pact-vicki-nelson-4/page-16.html","bookId":2467,"book":{"id":2467,"title":"Blood Pact (Vicki Nelson #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood Pact (Vicki Nelson #4) \n It began with the call no daughter ever wants to get, the call that told private investigator Vicki Nelson her mother had died.
