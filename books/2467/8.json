{"id":81865,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Unable to remain still, Vicki paced the outer office, uncomfortably conscious of Mrs. Shaw\u0027s damp and sympathetic gaze following her every move. She didn\u0027t need sympathy, she needed information.\n All right, so she hadn\u0027t reacted particularly well to being presented with a box of her mother\u0027s personal effects, but that was no reason for Mrs. Shaw to assume anything. If the last notation in the date book hadn\u0027t been, Call Vicki, she would\u0027ve been fine.\n \"Would you like a cup of coffee, dear?\"\n \"No. Thank you.\" Actually, she\u0027d love a cup of coffee, but she couldn\u0027t face using her mother\u0027s mug. \"Will Dr. Burke be long?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so. She just had to check on one of her grad students.\"\n \"Students? What does she teach?\"\n \"Oh, she doesn\u0027t actually teach, she just takes a few of the grad students under her wing and helps them along.\"\n \"Medical students?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure.\" Mrs. Shaw reached for a fresh tissue and dabbed at her eyes. \"Your mother would know. She was Dr. Burke\u0027s personal secretary.\"\n My mother isn\u0027t here. Vicki tried not to let the thought show on her face, given that the accompanying emotion was annoyance not grief.\n \"Your mother really respected Dr. Burke,\" Mrs. Shaw continued with a wistful glance across the room at the empty desk.\n \"She sounds like a person worth respecting,\" Vicki broke in before a flood of teary memories began.\n \"She\u0027s got, what, two degrees?\"\n \"Three. An MD, a doctorate in organic chemistry, and an MBA. Your mother always said hiring her to run this department was the smartest thing the university ever did. Most academics are not particularly good administrators and most administrators are completely insensitive to the needs of academia. Your mother called Dr. Burke a bridge between two worlds.\"\n Why the hell does it have to keep coming back to my mother? Vicki wondered, as Mrs. Shaw fielded three phone calls in quick succession.\n \"Yes, Professor Irving, I\u0027ll see that she gets the message as soon as she comes in.\" Mrs. Shaw dropped the receiver back into the cradle and sighed. \"That\u0027s how it goes all day. They all want a piece of her.\"\n \"I guess she doesn\u0027t have much time for lab work.\"\n \"Lab work? She barely has time to grab a bite to eat before someone needs her again.\" Patting the pile of memos, already impressive before the addition of the latest three, Mrs. Shaw\u0027s voice grew sharp. \"They\u0027ve got her running from meeting to meeting, solving this problem, solving that problem, burying her under forms and surveys and reports, annual this and semiannual that and biweekly the other... \"\n \"And God only knows how I\u0027m going to dig myself out without your mother\u0027s help.\"\n Mrs. Shaw colored and Vicki turned to face the door.\n \"Sorry to keep you waiting, Ms. Nelson.\" Dr. Burke crossed the room and held out a hand for her memos. \"But as you\u0027ve already heard, I\u0027m quite busy.\"\n \"No problem at all, Doctor.\" Something about that sturdy figure in the starched white lab coat had a calming effect, and Vicki followed her gesture into the inner office feeling more under control than she had in days. She suddenly remembered her mother describing her new boss, just after Dr. Burke had taken over the department, as being so completely self-assured that the urge to question anything became lost in her vicinity. Vicki\u0027d laughed at the time, but now she thought she could see what her mother had meant. She\u0027d felt a bit of the effect herself, earlier in the week. It had been Dr. Burke who\u0027d grounded her and sent her to the hospital morgue and Dr. Burke she\u0027d turned to for a eulogy.\n Before they\u0027d discovered a eulogy would be unnecessary.\n As Vicki settled into one of the almost comfortable wood and leather chairs, Dr. Burke moved around behind the desk and sat down, dropping the dozen or so pink squares of paper into a tidy pile. \"I\u0027m not usually in quite this much demand,\" she explained, shooting an annoyed glare at the pile. \"But it\u0027s end of term and bureaucratic nonsense that could have been taken care of months ago has to be dealt with immediately.\"\n \"You can\u0027t delegate?\"\n \"Science and Administration speak two different languages, Ms. Nelson. If I delegate, I end up having to translate. Frankly, it\u0027s much easier just to do it myself.\"\n Vicki recognized the tone; she\u0027d used it herself once or twice. \"I imagine you\u0027d rather be, oh, fiddling about with test tubes or something?\"\n \"Not at all.\" Dr. Burke smiled, and there was no mistaking the sincerity behind her words. \"I very much enjoy running other people\u0027s lives, seeing that each cog in a very complicated machine continues to run in its appointed place.\" It might have been more accurate to say, in the place I appoint, but Dr. Burke had no intention of allowing that much insight into her character. Now that we have established I enjoy my job, shall we get on with the investigation, Ms. Nelson? \"Mrs. Shaw tells me you want to ask about the tests I ran on your mother.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\" An early call to Dr. Friedman had determined that her mother\u0027s doctor had known about the tests, so they probably had nothing to do with... with the end result. But they were a place to start. Vicki pulled a pad of paper and a pen from the depths of her shoulder bag. \"I assume they had to do with her heart condition?\"\n \"Yes. Although I haven\u0027t practiced medicine for some time, I am a medical doctor and your mother, understandably upset, wanted a second opinion.\"\n \"And you told her?\"\n \"That she had perhaps six months to live without corrective surgery. Pretty much exactly what her own doctor told her.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t she go in for the surgery?\"\n \"It\u0027s not that easy,\" Dr. Burke said, leaning back in her chair and lacing her fingers across her stomach. \"There are always waiting lists for major surgery, especially transplants, which is what your mother would have needed, and with budget cuts... \"\n Vicki\u0027s pen gouged through the paper and her voice emerged through clenched teeth. \"So Dr. Friedman said.\" My mother could\u0027ve died from god-damned fucking budget cuts. \"I\u0027d like to see copies.\"\n \"Of the tests? I didn\u0027t keep any. I gave copies to your mother, who, I assume, gave them to her doctor, but I saw no point in keeping a set myself.\" Dr. Burke frowned. \"I did what I could for her. Do you doubt my diagnosis, Ms. Nelson?\"\n \"No. Of course not.\" So you were there for her and I wasn\u0027t. That\u0027s not the issue now. \"Who else knew about the tests?\"\n \"Why?\"\n The question came as no surprise, and Vicki realized it came primarily in response to her aggressive tone. She\u0027d have asked it herself if someone slammed a question at her with that amount of force. Brilliant interrogation technique, Nelson. Forgotten everything you ever learned? Maybe she should\u0027ve brought Celluci. Maybe she wasn\u0027t thinking clearly. No. I don\u0027t need him holding my hand. I\u0027ve worked through anger before. She\u0027d been one of the best; top of her class; the fair-haired girl of the Metro Police. She took a deep breath and fought for some semblance of professionalism. \"My mother\u0027s body is missing, Dr. Burke. I intend to find it and any information you might be able to give me can only help.\"\n Dr. Burke leaned forward, both hands flat on the desk. \"You think that the body was taken by someone who knew she was going to die?\"\n Celluci\u0027d always said she was a lousy liar. Vicki looked Dr. Burke in the eye and decided not to even make the attempt. \"Yes. That\u0027s exactly what I think.\"\n Dr. Burke held her gaze for a moment, then sat back again. \"Besides myself and Dr. Friedman, I can only be certain of Mrs. Shaw, although it\u0027s likely Dr. Friedman\u0027s nurse knew. I didn\u0027t tell anyone, Mrs. Shaw might have, and your mother could have mentioned it to friends, of course.\"\n \"She never mentioned it to me,\" Vicki snarled and then pressed her lips tightly shut, afraid of what else might slip out. She hadn\u0027t intended to say that.\n \"Given that we were using university equipment,\" Dr. Burke continued, graciously ignoring the outburst, \"I can\u0027t guarantee that no one else knew about the testing, you understand.\"\n \"Yes.\" A single word seemed safe enough. Pity she had to use more; every syllable carried more heat than the last and there didn\u0027t seem to be anything she could do about it. \"I need to speak with those members of your department my mother came into frequent contact with.\"\n \"That would be all of them,\" Dr. Burke told her dryly. \"But surely you don\u0027t believe that someone in my department is responsible?\"\n \"They do seem to be the first people I should check, don\u0027t they?\"\n Answering a question with a question. Nice try, Ms. Nelson, but I have no intention of surrendering control. \"I\u0027d certainly be interested in your reasons for thinking so.\"\n As her reasons for thinking so were based solely on a midnight visit she had no intention of mentioning, Vicki found herself momentarily at a loss. \"The members of your department are scientists.\"\n \"And why would a scientist take your mother\u0027s body?\" Dr. Burke kept her expression outwardly neutral while inwardly she kicked Donald\u0027s careless butt. She knew Catherine couldn\u0027t be counted on to consider the more mundane aspects of the situation, but she\u0027d expected better of him. It was obvious that last night\u0027s side trip had been observed. Nothing else but the knowledge that a dead woman was up and walking around could logically account for the sudden obstinate certainty that someone at the university had to be responsible. \"It could just as easily,\" she continued, \"have been taken by a spurned lover. Have you looked into that possibility?\"\n \"She had no lover,\" Vicki ground out, \"spurned or otherwise.\"\n Behind a mask of polite apology, Dr. Burke enjoyed the reaction. Of course she didn\u0027t. Mothers never do. Aloud she said, \"That brings us back to my scientists, then. Shall I have Mrs. Shaw make some phone calls for you, set up appointments?\" It was a large university and there were ways to make it larger still.\n \"If you would. Thank you.\" Well aware that Dr. Burke\u0027s assistance could cut through the time-consuming tangle of academic red tape, Vicki had been about to ask. That Dr. Burke remained on the list of potential suspects devalued that assistance not at all. The manner of the assistance, could, in fact, be used as further evidence. \"I need to talk to the faculty in the school of medicine.\" She\u0027d start with the obvious. Later, if necessary, she\u0027d widen the circle. If necessary, she\u0027d tear the bloody university apart, limestone block by limestone block.\n \"I\u0027ll do what I can. If I might make a suggestion, your mother was quite friendly with a Dr. Devlin, a cellular biologist.\" And talking with that old Irish reprobate should keep you busy sorting fact from fancy for days. \"In fact, he comfortably covers both our theories as I believe he was very fond of her.\"\n \"Both our theories?\"\n \"The scientist and the spurned lover.\"\n Just for a moment, Vicki wondered if her mother had gotten involved with someone who\u0027d refused to surrender to death; wondered if a twisted love had tried to force a return of life and created the travesty of her mother she\u0027d seen at the window. No. Impossible. Henry said there was another one. And besides, she\u0027d have told me if she\u0027d met someone new.\n The way she told you about her heart condition? asked a small voice.\n Dr. Burke watched the emotional storm playing out across her visitor\u0027s face and decided the experiment was in no immediate danger. Although last night\u0027s unfortunate lapse in security had brought Ms. Nelson closer to the truth, when it came right down to it, close didn\u0027t count. And now I\u0027ve given her something new to think about. Dr. Devlin should be in for an interesting interview. When that played out, another wild goose could always be found.\n In the meantime, it was obvious to even the most casual observer, which she most certainly was not, that Marjory Nelson\u0027s daughter rode a precarious balance between rigid control and a complete breakdown. An emotional teeter-totter that could only get in the way of an objective investigation and a situation easy to exploit.\n \"It\u0027s amazing,\" she murmured, almost as though she were speaking to herself, \"how much you resemble your mother.\"\n Vicki started. \"Me?\"\n \"You\u0027re taller, of course, and your mother wore no glasses, but the line of your jaw is identical and your mouth moves very much the way hers did.\"\n Did... Her mother\u0027s face rose up in memory, a sheet of glass between them, eyes wide, mouth silently working.\n \"In fact, you have many of the same mannerisms.\"\n Vicki desperately tried to banish the horror her mother had become and replace it with an earlier memory. The sheet lifted, the gray and waxy pallor of death, the chemical smell of the hospital morgue... In the memory before that, a phone rang on, unanswered.\n \"Ms. Nelson? Are you all right?\"\n \"Fine.\" The word was a warning.\n Dr. Burke stood, satisfaction covered with polite regret. \"If you have no further questions, I\u0027m afraid I have a list as long as my arm of meetings to attend. I\u0027ll have Mrs. Shaw set up those appointments for you.\"\n Vicki shoved her notes into her bag and stood as well, jabbing at her glasses. \"Thank you,\" she said, forcing her mouth to form the conversational phrases. \"And thank you for your time this morning.\" Throwing the bag up onto her shoulder, she headed quickly toward the door. She neither knew nor cared if she\u0027d covered all she\u0027d intended to. She wanted out of that office. Of that building. She wanted to be somewhere where no one knew her mother. Where no one could see reflections of the dead in her face.\n \"Ms. Nelson? We miss your mother around here.\" Intended to be a parting dig at damaged defenses, Dr. Burke found to her surprise that she meant what she was saying and instead of twisting the knife, finished simply with, \"The office seems empty without her.\"\n Halfway out the door, Vicki turned and acknowledged the observation with a single nod. She couldn\u0027t trust herself to speak and wished, just for that instant, that she\u0027d listened to Celluci and not come here alone.\n Dr. Burke spread her hands and her voice picked up the cadence of a benediction. \"I guarantee, she didn\u0027t suffer at the end.\"\n \"No. I\u0027m sorry, Detective, but none of these photographs are of the Tom Chen that we employed.\"\n Celluci pulled the shot of Tom Chen, medical student, out of the pile. \"You\u0027re sure about this one?\"\n \"Quite. Our Mr. Chen had slightly longer hair, more prominent cheekbones, and a completely different eyebrow line. We reshape a lot of faces in this business, Detective,\" the younger Mr. Hutchinson continued in response to Celluci\u0027s silent question. \"We become used to observing dominant characteristics.\"\n \"Yeah, I suppose you do.\" Celluci slid the grainy black and white photographs back into the large manila envelope. Tom Chen, or whatever his name actually was, was not now attending medical school at Queen\u0027s, nor had he graduated from the program over the last three years.\n Detective Fergusson had been more than willing to call the registrar\u0027s office on campus and suggest they release the pictures.\n \"No problem,\" the Kingston police officer had declared with complete insincerity. \"I\u0027m more than willing to humor ex-Detective Nelson and her wild corpse chase.\" The distinctive sound of hot coffee being slurped from a cardboard cup echoed over the line. \"You catch the news this morning? Half the fucking force goes out with some kind of spring flu and some asshole starts strangling young lovers. We got a hysterical witness, who\u0027s seen Michael Jackson\u0027s \u0027Thriller\u0027 video one too many times, if you ask me, and no suspects. And I don\u0027t need to tell you that the fresher the corpse, the higher the priority. If a phone call will keep your girlfriend happy and off my back while I deal with this new situation, it\u0027s worth the two minutes it\u0027ll take.\"\n Celluci\u0027d been tempted to tell him that the two were connected in one final attempt at enlisting law and order against whatever it was that Vicki and Fitzroy were dispensing but at the last minute decided he\u0027d better not. Your murderer is a reanimated corpse, Detective. How do I know? A vampire told me. Kingston had a large psychiatric facility and he had no intention of ending up in it.\n Meanwhile, the search for Igor moved no further ahead.\n \"All right, Mr. Hutchinson.\" Time to try another angle. \"You said that all funeral directors have to serve a four-week observation period at a funeral home before they\u0027re accepted into a training program.\"\n The younger Mr. Hutchinson leaned back in his chair. \"That\u0027s correct.\"\n \"Well, where do these observers come from?\"\n \"From the applicants to the program at Humber College in Toronto.\"\n \"So this young man, whoever he was, had to have applied to that program?\"\n \"Oh, yes, and gone through an interview. The Health Sciences people try very hard to weed out unsuitable candidates before they\u0027re placed for observation.\"\n Celluci frowned. \"So, it was just chance that Ig... Tom Chen, for lack of a better name, ended up here?\"\n \"No, not at all. He asked to come here. Said he\u0027d been impressed by the way we handled the funeral of his aunt some years before and wanted to work with us.\" Mr. Hutchinson sighed. \"All fabricated, I presume, but at the time we were flattered and agreed to take him on. He was a very pleasant fellow and everyone liked him.\"\n \"Yeah, well everyone makes a bad call now and then.\" Celluci finished scrawling a note to call Humber College, shoved his notebook in his pocket and stood, glad to be leaving. Funeral homes, with their carpets and flowers and tastefully arranged furniture gave him the creeps. \"I wouldn\u0027t worry about it. I don\u0027t suppose you get much opportunity to practice character assessment.\"\n Mr. Hutchinson rose as well, his expression stony. \"Our services are for the benefit of the living, Detective,\" he snapped. \"And I assure you, we are quite as capable of character assessment as, say, the police department. Good day.\"\n As he had nothing more to ask, Celluci accepted the dismissal. Once outside, he snorted and headed for the nearest bus stop, with the suspect\u0027s transit habits still their only concrete clue, he\u0027d left his car at the apartment building. \"Quite as capable of character assessment as the police department,\" he repeated, digging for change. \"Just a little sensitive there, aren\u0027t we?\" Still, he supposed that funeral directors were as sick of stereotypes as, well, police officers, so the comment hadn\u0027t been entirely undeserved.\n Swinging up onto the Johnson Street bus, he glanced back at the seat just in front of the rear door, hoping for a young, Oriental male, eating candy. The seat was empty.\n \"Of course it is,\" he muttered, sitting in it himself. \"Or it would be too easy.\"\n \"Violent Crimes. Detective-Sergeant Graham.\"\n \"Why the hell aren\u0027t you out working? Jesus, I can\u0027t take my eyes off you for a second.\"\n \"Hello, Mike. I miss you, too.\"\n Celluci grinned and braced the phone against his shoulder. \"Listen, Dave, I need you to do me a favor.\"\n On the other end of the line, his partner sighed with enough force to rattle the wires between Toronto and Kingston. \"Of course you do. Whey else would you call?\"\n \"I want you to call Humber College and talk to someone in Health Sciences about a Tom Chen who applied recently to their funeral director\u0027s program.\"\n \"Humber... Health Sciences... Tom Chen... Okay. What do you want to know?\"\n \"Everything they know.\"\n \"About this Chen?\"\n \"No, about life in general.\" Celluci rolled his eyes at his reflection in the etched mirror over the couch. \"The name\u0027s an alias, but that shouldn\u0027t make any difference to your inquiries. And I need the info ASAP.\"\n The wires rattled again. \"Of course you do. How\u0027s she holding up?\"\n \"Vicki?\"\n \"No, her mother, asshole.\"\n \"About as well as can be expected, all things considered.\"\n \"Yeah. Well... \" There was a pause while things were considered. \"So, you going to be at Vicki\u0027s mother\u0027s place for the next couple of days?\"\n Celluci looked around the apartment. \"Far as I know. You got the number?\"\n \"Yeah. I\u0027ll call collect.\"\n \"Cheap Scots bastard,\" Celluci muttered and hung up, smiling. Dave Graham was a good cop and a loyal friend. Except in their dedication to their work, they were nothing alike, and their partnership was both successful and uncomplicated.\n \"Uncomplicated; I could use a little of that right now.\" Celluci headed for the kitchen and the coffee maker. \"Vicki\u0027s dead mother is paying house calls. Some joker who\u0027s equally dead is murdering teenagers. And there\u0027s a vampire in the closet.\"\n He froze, a step half taken.\n \"A completely helpless vampire in the closet.\"\n Even with the door braced from the inside, it would still be so easy to remove his rival. To have Vicki to himself. To let in just enough sunlight...\n He finished the step and picked up the coffeepot. Fitzroy was too smart, had lived too long, to be in that closet if he thought he was in any danger. Celluci shook his head at the subtlety of trust and lifted a mug of coffee in salute.\n \"Sleep well, you son of a bitch.\"\n Rubbing at her temples with both hands, Vicki exhaled noisily. Adrenaline had run out some time before and she was mind-numbingly tired. The physical exhaustion she could cope with, had coped with many times in the past, but emotionally she felt as though she\u0027d spent the day being flayed and then salted.\n Dr. Burke had begun it, with her sudden sympathy, and then Dr. Devlin had finished the job. He had been more than fond of her mother and, still devastated by her death, had, in typical Irish fashion, poured out his grief. Vicki, unable to stop him, had sat dry-eyed while the middle-aged professor railed against the cruelties of fate, told of how universally Marjory Nelson had been liked and respected, and went on in detail about how proud Marjory Nelson had been of her daughter. Vicki knew how to stop him, \"Sometimes,\" the cadet instructor had told them, \"you want to give the person you\u0027re questioning their head. Let them talk about whatever they want, we\u0027ll teach you how to separate the gold from the dross. But sometimes, you have to cut it short and take control...\" she just couldn\u0027t do it.\n She didn\u0027t want to hear what a wonderful person her mother had been, how much they\u0027d all depended on her, how much they missed her, but not listening felt like a betrayal. And she\u0027d done enough of that already.\n The box of personal effects she\u0027d taken from the office sat accusingly at the end of the coffee table. She hadn\u0027t been able to do more with it than get it back to the apartment and even that hadn\u0027t been easy. It had weighed a lot more than it looked like it should.\n All at once, she became aware that Celluci had just asked her a question and she had no idea what it had been. \"Sorry,\" she said, shoving her glasses back into place with enough force to drive the plastic bridge into her forehead.\n He exchanged a look with Henry and although she didn\u0027t catch the content, she didn\u0027t like the possibilities. Separately, she could barely handle them. At this point a united front, on any issue, would be beyond her.\n \"I asked,\" he repeated levelly, \"about Dr. Burke\u0027s grad students. You told us she had some. Any chance they could be doing the work under her supervision?\"\n \"I doubt it. According to Mrs. Shaw, when I went back for that appointment list, one\u0027s into bacteria, a couple have something to do with computers, and one, and I\u0027m paraphrasing here, is a fuck-up who can\u0027t make up his mind. I\u0027ll... \" Celluci opened his mouth but she corrected herself before he could speak, \"we\u0027ll check them out further tomorrow.\"\n Henry sat forward in his chair, his expression one she\u0027d begun to recognize as his hunting face. \"So you do suspect Dr. Burke?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what I think about Dr. Burke.\" Looking back on the interview, all Vicki could hear was the doctor\u0027s voice saying quietly, \"It\u0027s amazing how much you resemble your mother.\" Which was an irrelevant observation at the best of times and doubly so now; her mother was dead. \"She\u0027s got the necessary arrogance, that\u0027s for damned sure, and the intelligence and the background, but all anyone can talk about is what a brilliant administrator she is.\" She shrugged and wished she hadn\u0027t; her shoulders felt as though they were balancing lead weights. \"Still, until we know she didn\u0027t do it, she stays on the list. I think, though, we can safely ignore Dr. Devlin.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because he could never have kept the research secret. If he were doing this,\" she made the innocuous pronoun sound like a curse, \"he wouldn\u0027t be able to keep from telling the world. Besides, I gather he\u0027s a devout Irish Catholic and until recently, they weren\u0027t even keen on autopsies.\"\n \"He\u0027s also a scientist,\" Celluci pointed out. \"And he could be acting.\"\n \"All the world\u0027s a stage,\" Henry added quietly, \"and we but players on it.\"\n Celluci rolled his eyes. \"What the hell is that supposed to mean.\"\n \"That if you do talk to the person responsible, they\u0027re going to lie.\"\n \"That\u0027s why you build a body of evidence, Fitzroy. To catch the liars. We know more tonight than we did last night and we\u0027ll know more tomorrow than we do now. Eventually the truth will out. Nothing stays hidden forever.\"\n We haven\u0027t got forever. Henry wanted to say. Every moment that passes eats into her. How long before there\u0027s nothing left but a cause? \"We need a smoking gun,\" he said instead.\n Celluci snorted in disbelief. The phrase sounded ridiculous coming from Henry\u0027s mouth. \"You have been reading the literature.\"\n Henry ignored him. \"I\u0027m going to track the other one; the male who killed the teenager. There were too many police around to do it last night. If I find him, I\u0027ll find your mother\u0027s body as well.\"\n \"And then?\" Vicki demanded. \"What do we do then?\"\n \"We give them to Detective Fergusson. Lead him to the laboratory. Let him deal with the... \"\n \"Wait a minute,\" Celluci interrupted. \"You\u0027re actually suggesting we let the police handle this?\"\n \"Why not? We have no one to protect this time, except me, and unlike ancient Egyptian gods of darkness or demons summoned up out of hell, mad scientists should fall within the capabilities of the law.\"\n Celluci closed his mouth. Wasn\u0027t that his argument?\n \"Henry, you can\u0027t go to the police,\" Vicki began.\n Henry smiled and cut her off. \"I won\u0027t. I\u0027ll deliver the information to you. You\u0027ll deliver it to the police. Detective Fergusson will be so happy to have his murderer, I think he\u0027ll let you be a bit vague as to where and how you found it.\"\n Vicki\u0027s lips almost curved. \"You know, most guys just give a girl flowers or candy.\"\n \"Most guys,\" Henry agreed.\n The air in the apartment seemed suddenly charged and Celluci felt the hair on his arms rise. Fitzroy\u0027s eyes had darkened and even from across the room he thought he could see Vicki\u0027s reflection gazing out of their depths. The sudden flash of understanding snapped the pencil he held. Neither of them noticed.\n Vampire.\n How often do vampires have to feed?\n Had Fitzroy fed at all since they\u0027d come to Kingston?\n Yeah, well you\u0027re not feeding in front of me, boyo. And you\u0027re not sending me off to never, never land again while you... while you...\n While you offer her a comfort she won\u0027t take from me.\n Another look at Henry\u0027s face and he knew the offer wouldn\u0027t be made at his expense. Somewhere, somewhen, they\u0027d gone beyond that.\n \"I\u0027ve got to get out of here.\" His voice brusk but determined, Celluci stood. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m doing this. \"I need a nice long walk to clear my head. Help me think.\" Half a dozen long-legged strides took him to the door. He yanked his jacket off the coat stand and charged out into the hall before they had a chance to try and stop him. \u0027Cause I sure as shit can\u0027t offer this more than once.\n Safely outside, door closed behind him, he sagged against the wall and closed his eyes for a second, amazed at what he\u0027d just done. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, see a man act like a fool completely of his own free will.\n But he had the day.\n Was it fair to deny Fitzroy the night?\n And anyway, he shoved both hands up through his hair. It should be Vicki\u0027s choice. Not a choice forced on her by my presence.\n If you love something, let it go... .\n \"Jesus H. Christ. What kind of idiot takes advice from a fucking T-shirt?\"\n Vicki stared across the room at the apartment door and then turned to stare at Henry. \"Did he just?... \"\n \"Leave?\" Henry nodded, more than a little amazed himself. \"Yes.\"\n She couldn\u0027t get her brain around it. \"Why?\"\n \"I believe he is removing himself as an obstacle between us.\"\n \"Between us? You mean so we can?... \"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Why that arrogant shit!\" Her brows snapped down, but she was so tired the exclamation had little force. \"Didn\u0027t he think I might have something to say about that?\"\n Henry spread his hands, the fine red-gold hairs glinting in the lamplight. \"No one\u0027s stopping you from saying it, Vicki.\"\n She glared at him for a moment longer, then sighed. \"All right. Valid point. But I think you two are getting along too god-damned well.\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t it make things easier for you if Detective-Sergeant Celluci and I got along?\"\n \"That depends.\" She sank back against the sofa cushions and added dryly, \"On how well you get along.\"\n \"Vicki!\" Her name dripped with exaggerated shock. \"Surely you don\u0027t think... \"\n It took her a moment to catch the implication and when she did, she couldn\u0027t stop herself from giggling. It had to be the exhaustion; she never giggled. \"You wish. Michael Celluci is straight enough to draw lines with.\"\n Henry\u0027s smile changed slightly and his eyes darkened, enough of the hunter showing to make his desire plain. \"Then I shall have to find someone else.\"\n Vicki swallowed, if only to move her heart down out of her throat. He was making no attempt to catch her gaze, to draw her into his power. If she said no, and she could taste the word on her tongue, he would hunt elsewhere. But he needs me. Even from across the room, she could feel his Hunger. It wouldn\u0027t be a betrayal. There was nothing more she could do for her mother tonight. More important, his needs covered hers and behind their camouflage, she could, if only for the duration, let go.\n He needs me. Repeated, it drew attention from the more dangerous, I need him.\n \"Vicki?\"\n His voice stroked heat into her skin. \"Yes.\"\n Celluci watched Henry cross the parking lot, and worked at unclenching his teeth. There was nothing in the way the other man, vampire-slash-romance writer, Celluci savagely corrected the thought, moved to give any indication of what had gone on in the apartment. Well, he doesn\u0027t brag. I\u0027ll give the little fucker that.\n \"Detective.\"\n \"Fitzroy.\"\n \"Be quiet when you go into the apartment. She\u0027s asleep.\"\n \"How is she?\"\n \"Some of the knots have loosened. I wish I could say they\u0027ll still be that way in the morning.\"\n \"You shouldn\u0027t have left her alone.\" I left her alone and look what happened. They both heard the corollary. They both ignored it.\n \"I\u0027m listening to her heartbeat, Detective. I can be at her side in seconds. And this is as far as I\u0027ll go until you\u0027re ready to take over.\"\n Celluci snorted and wished he could think of something to say.\n Henry lifted his face and breathed deeply of the night. \"It\u0027s going to rain. I\u0027d best not linger.\"\n \"Yeah.\" Hands shoved into his jacket pockets, Celluci pushed himself up off his car. All right, so he hadn\u0027t walked far. He hadn\u0027t said he was going to. He wanted to believe that Fitzroy had left her no choice but he knew better; he wouldn\u0027t have left if that had been even a possibility.\n \"Michael.\"\n Pulled around by his name, he tried not to let any of what he was feeling show on his face. It wasn\u0027t hard. He didn\u0027t know exactly what he was feeling.\n \"Thank you.\"\n Celluci started to ask, For what?, but he bit it back. Something in Henry\u0027s tone, he\u0027d call it honesty if forced to put a name to it, denied a facetious response. Instead, he nodded, once, and asked, \"What would you have done if she\u0027d said no?\" Even before the last word left his mouth, he wondered why he was asking.\n Henry\u0027s gesture seemed to move past the overlapping yellow-white of the streetlights. \"We\u0027re in the middle of a small city, Detective. I\u0027d have managed.\"\n \"You\u0027d have gone to a stranger?\"\n Red-gold brows, darkened by shadow, rose. \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t have had time to make friends.\"\n Sure, take the cheap shot. \"Don\u0027t you know there\u0027s a fucking epidemic on?\"\n \"It\u0027s a disease of the blood, Detective. I know when someone is infected and am therefore able to avoid it.\"\n Celluci tossed the curl of hair back off his forehead. \"Lucky you,\" he grunted. \"I still don\u0027t think that you should... I mean... \" He kicked at the gravel and swore when a rock propelled by his foot clanged off the undercarriage of his car. Why the hell was he worrying about Fitzroy anyway? The son of a bitch had lasted centuries, he could take care of himself. Trusting him is one thing. And I\u0027m not sure I do. I am certainly not beginning to like him. Uh-uh. No way. Forget it. \"Look, even if you can sense it, you shouldn\u0027t be... \" Be what? Jesus, normal vocabulary is not up to this. \"... doing it with strangers,\" he finished in a hurry.\n Henry\u0027s lips curled up into a speculative smile. \"That could be difficult,\" he said softly, \"if we stay here for very long. Even if she were willing, I can\u0027t feed off Vicki every time the Hunger rises.\"\n The night air suddenly got hard to breathe. Celluci yanked at his collar.\n \"And after all,\" Henry continued, the corners of his eyes crinkling with amusement, \"there\u0027s only one other person in this city who I can\u0027t consider a stranger.\"\n It took Celluci the same moment it had taken Vicki. \"You wish,\" he snarled, whirled on one heel, and stomped toward the apartment building.\n Smile broadening, Henry watched him go, listening to the angry pounding of Celluci\u0027s heart as he charged around the corner and out of sight. It had been less than kind to tease the mortal when he\u0027d been honestly concerned but the opportunity had been impossible to resist.\n \"And if I wished,\" he reminded the night when he had it to himself again. \"I would.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-pact-vicki-nelson-4/page-8.html","bookId":2467,"book":{"id":2467,"title":"Blood Pact (Vicki Nelson #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood Pact (Vicki Nelson #4) \n It began with the call no daughter ever wants to get, the call that told private investigator Vicki Nelson her mother had died.
