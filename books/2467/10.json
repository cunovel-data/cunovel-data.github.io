{"id":81867,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Vicki woke first and lay staring blindly at the ceiling, uncertain where she was. The room felt unfamiliar, the dimensions wrong, the patterns of shadow that made up the world without her glasses not patterns she, recognized. It wasn\u0027t her bedroom, nor, in spite of the man still asleep beside her, was it Celluci\u0027s.\\n\\n Then she remembered.\\n\\n Just past dawn, the two of them had lain down on her mother\u0027s bed. Her dead mother\u0027s bed. Two of them, where there should\u0027ve been three.\\n\\n All three of us in my dead mother\u0027s bed? The edge on the sarcasm very nearly drew blood. Get a grip, Nelson.\\n\\n She slid out from under Celluci\u0027s arm without waking him and groped on the bedside table for her glasses, the daylight seeping around the edges of the blinds providing barely enough illumination for her to function. Her nose almost touching the surface of the clock radio, she scowled at the glowing red numbers. Ten minutes after nine. Two hours\u0027 sleep. Add that to the time Henry had granted her and she\u0027d certainly functioned on less.\\n\\n Pulling her robe closer around her, she stood. She couldn\u0027t go back to sleep now anyway. She couldn\u0027t face the dreams, Henry burning and screaming her name while he burned, her mother\u0027s rotting body a living barrier between them. If she wanted to save Henry, she had to go past her mother. And she couldn\u0027t. Feelings of fear and failure combined, lingered.\\n\\n My subconscious is anything but subtle.\\n\\n Bare feet moving soundlessly over the soft nap of the carpet, it was still nearly new; Vicki could remember how pleased her mother had been to have replaced a worn area rug with thick wall-to-wall plush, she made her way to the walk-in closet where Henry had been spending his days. After a moment\u0027s groping to find the switch, she flicked on the closet light and closed the door silently behind her.\\n\\n It was, as Henry had said, just barely large enough for a not-so-very-tall man. Or a not-so-very-tall vampire. A pad of bright blue compressed foam, the sort commonly used for camping, lay along one wall under the rack of woman\u0027s clothes. On it, a neatly folded length of heavy blackout curtain rested beside a leather overnight bag. Another piece of curtain had been tacked to one side of the door which itself had been fitted out with a heavy steel bolt.\\n\\n Henry must\u0027ve put it up. Vicki touched the metal slide and shook her head. She hadn\u0027t heard hammering but, given Henry\u0027s strength, hammering might not have been necessary. We\u0027d better remember to take it down or it\u0027ll confuse the hell out of the next tenant.\\n\\n The next tenant. It was the first time she\u0027d considered the apartment as anything but her mother\u0027s. Only reasonable, I suppose. She let her head fall back against the wall and closed her eyes. My mother\u0027s dead.\\n\\n The scent of her mother\u0027s cologne, of her mother, permeated the small enclosure, and with her eyes shut it almost seemed that her mother was still there. Another time, the illusion might have been comforting, or infuriating. Vicki was honest enough to admit the possibility of either reaction. At the moment, though, she ignored it. Her mother wasn\u0027t the reason she was here.\\n\\n Opening her eyes, she dropped to her knees beside the pallet and lifted the makeshift shroud to her face, breathing in the faint trace of Henry trapped in the heavy fabric.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t dead. She refused to believe it. He was too real to be dead.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t dead.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not entirely certain.\" With knuckles white around the folds, she set the piece of curtain down and turned to face Celluci, standing outlined in the doorway. He\u0027d opened the blinds in the bedroom and the morning sun behind him threw his face into shadow. Vicki couldn\u0027t see his expression, but his tone had been almost gentle. She didn\u0027t have a clue to what he was thinking.\\n\\n He held out his hand and she put hers into it, allowing him to pull her to her feet. His palm was warm and callused. Henry\u0027s would have been cool and smooth. With her free hand resting on a crumpled expanse of shirtfront, she had the sudden and completely irrational desire to take that one extra step into the circle of Celluci\u0027s arms and to rest her head, not to mention the whole mess she found herself in, if only for a moment, on the broad expanse of his shoulders.\\n\\n This is no time to be getting soft, Vicki, she told herself sternly, fighting the iron bands tightening around her ribs. You\u0027ve got far too fucking much to do.\\n\\n Celluci, who\u0027d read both the desire and the internal response off Vicki\u0027s face, smiled wryly and moved out of her way. He recognized the growing strain that painted purple half-circles under her eyes and pinched the corners of her mouth and knew that some of it needed to be bled off before it blew her apart. But he didn\u0027t know what to do. Although their fights had often been therapeutic, this situation went a little beyond the relief that could come from screaming at one another over trivial disagreements. While he could think of a few nontrivial disagreements available for argument, he had no intention of hurting her by bringing them up. All he could do was continue to wait and hope he was the one in the right place to pick up the pieces.\\n\\n Of course, if Fitzroy\u0027s actually bought it... It was a dishonorable thought, but he couldn\u0027t stop it from taking up residence.\\n\\n \"So.\" He watched her cross to the open bedroom door and wondered how long he\u0027d have been content with the status quo had Fitzroy not come into their lives. \"What do we do now?\"\\n\\n Vicki turned and stared at him in some surprise. \"We do exactly what we have been doing.\" She jabbed her glasses up onto the bridge of her nose. \"When we find the people who have my mother\u0027s body, we\u0027ll find Henry.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe he just went to ground, got caught out too late and had to take what shelter he could.\"\\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t do that to me if he could help it.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027d call?\" Celluci couldn\u0027t prevent the mocking tone.\\n\\n Vicki\u0027s chin went up. \"Yeah. He\u0027d call.\" He wouldn\u0027t leave me to think he was dead if he could help it. You don\u0027t do that to someone you say you love. \"We find my mother. We find Henry.\" He couldn\u0027t call if he was dead. He isn\u0027t dead. \"Do you understand?\"\\n\\n Actually, he did. After nine years, he\u0027d gotten proficient at reading her subtext. And if his understanding was all she\u0027d take... Celluci spread his hands, the gesture both conciliatory and an indication that he had no wish to continue the discussion.\\n\\n Some of the stiffness went out of Vicki\u0027s stance. \"You make coffee,\" she told him, \"while I shower.\"\\n\\n Celluci rolled his eyes. \"What do I look like? Live-in help?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Vicki felt her lower lip tremble and sternly stilled it. \"You look like someone I can count on. No matter what.\" Then, before the lump in her throat did any more damage, she wheeled on one bare, heel and strode out of the room.\\n\\n His own throat tight, Celluci pushed the curl of hair back off his face. \"Just when you\u0027re ready to give up on her,\" he muttered. Shaking his head, he went to make the coffee.\\n\\n Running her fingers through her wet hair, Vicki wandered into the living room and dropped onto the couch. She could hear Celluci mumbling to himself in the kitchen and, remembering what had happened on other occasions, decided it might be safer not to bother him when he was cooking. Without quite knowing how it happened, she found herself lifting the box of her mother\u0027s personal effects and setting it in front of her on the coffee table.\\n\\n I suppose no day\u0027s so bad that you can\u0027t make it worse.\\n\\n There was surprisingly little in it: a sweater kept hanging over the back of the office chair, just in case; two lipsticks, one pale pink, the other a surprisingly brilliant red; half a bottle of aspirin; the coffee mug; the datebook with its final futile message; her academy graduation portrait; and a pile of loose papers.\\n\\n Vicki picked up the photograph and stared into the face of the smiling young woman. She looked so young. So confident. \"I looked like I thought I knew everything.\"\\n\\n \"You still think you know everything.\" Celluci handed her a mug of coffee and plucked the picture out of her grasp. \"Good God. It\u0027s a baby cop.\"\\n\\n \"If I ignore you, will you go back into the kitchen?\"\\n\\n He thought about it for a second. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Great.\" Pulling her bathrobe securely closed, Vicki lifted out the loose paper. Why on earth did Mrs. Shaw think I\u0027d want a bunch of Mother\u0027s notes? Then she saw how each page began.\\n\\n Dear Vicki: You\u0027re probably wondering why a letter instead of a phone call, but I\u0027ve got something important to tell you and I thought I might get through it easier this way, without interruptions. I haven\u0027t written a letter for a while so I hope you\u0027ll forgive...\\n\\n Dear Vicki: Did I tell you the results of my last checkup? Well, I probably didn\u0027t want to bore you with details, but...\\n\\n Dear Vicki: First of all, I love you very much and...\\n\\n Dear Vicki: When your father left, I promised you that I\u0027d always be there for you. I wish I...\\n\\n Dear Vicki: There are some things that are easier to say on paper, so I hope you\u0027ll forgive me this small distance I have to put between us. Dr. Friedman tells me that I\u0027ve got a problem with my heart and I may not have long to live. Please don\u0027t fly off the handle and start demanding I see another doctor. I have.\\n\\n Yes, I\u0027m afraid. Any sensible person would be. But mostly I was afraid that something would happen before I found the courage to tell you.\\n\\n I don\u0027t want to just disappear out of your life like your father did. I want us to have a chance to say goodbye. When you get this letter, call me. We\u0027ll make arrangements for you to come home for a few days and we\u0027ll sit down and really talk.\\n\\n I love you.\\n\\n The last and most complete letter was dated from the Friday before Marjory Nelson died.\\n\\n Vicki fought tears and with shaking hands laid the letters back in the box.\\n\\n \"Vicki?\"\\n\\n She shook her head, unable to push her voice past an almost equal mix of grief and anger. Even if the letter had been mailed, they still wouldn\u0027t have had time to say good-bye. Jesus Christ, Mom, why didn\u0027t you have Dr. Friedman call me?\\n\\n Celluci leaned forward and scanned the top page. \"Vicki, I... \"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t.\" Her teeth were clenched so tightly it felt as though there was an iron band wrapped around her temples. One more sympathetic word, one more word of any kind, would destroy the fingernail grip she had on her control. Moving blindly, she stood and hurried toward the bedroom. \"I\u0027ve got to get dressed. We\u0027ve got to look for Henry.\"\\n\\n At 10:20, Catherine lifted the lid of the isolation box and smiled in at the woman who had once been Marjory Nelson. \"I know; it\u0027s pretty boring in there, isn\u0027t it?\" She pulled on a pair of surgical gloves and deftly unhooked the jack and laid it, gold prongs gleaming, to one side. \"Just give me half a sec and we\u0027ll see what we can do about getting you out of there.\" Nutrient tubes were tugged gently from catheters and tucked away in specific compartments in the sides of the box. \"You\u0027ve got amazingly good skin tone, all things considered, but I think that working a little estrogen cream into the epidermis might be in order. We don\u0027t want things to tear while you\u0027re up and moving around.\"\\n\\n Catherine hummed tunelessly to herself as she worked, stopping twice to make notes on muscle resilience and joint flexibility. So far, number ten proved her theory. None of the others, not even number nine, had responded to the bacteria quite so well. She couldn\u0027t wait to see how Donald, number eleven, turned out.\\n\\n Had she seen the girl before? Why couldn\u0027t she remember?\\n\\n The girl was not the right girl, although she didn\u0027t understand why not.\\n\\n Hooking her fingers over the side of the box, she pulled herself up into a sitting position.\\n\\n There was something she had to do.\\n\\n Catherine shook her head. Initiative was all very well but at the moment a prone, immobile body would be of more use.\\n\\n \"Lie down,\" she said sternly.\\n\\n Lie down.\\n\\n The command traveled deeply rutted pathways and the body obeyed.\\n\\n But she didn\u0027t want to lie down.\\n\\n At least she didn\u0027t think she did.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re trying to frown, that\u0027s wonderful!\" Catherine clapped gloved hands together. \"Even partial control of the zygomaticus minor is a definite advance. I\u0027ve got to take some measurements.\"\\n\\n Number nine watched closely as she moved about the other one like him. He remembered another word.\\n\\n Need.\\n\\n When she needed him, he\u0027d be there.\\n\\n Just for an instant, he thought he remembered music.\\n\\n With number ten measured, moisturized, dressed, and sitting at the side of the room, Catherine finally turned her attention to the intruder. She\u0027d heard no sounds at all from what had been number nine\u0027s box since she\u0027d returned to the lab and she rather hoped he hadn\u0027t died. With no brain wave patterns and no bacteria tailored, it would be a waste of a perfectly good body, especially as, if he\u0027d suffocated or had a heart attack, there wouldn\u0027t even be any trauma to repair.\\n\\n \"Of course, if he has died, we could use Donald\u0027s brain wave patterns and the generic bacteria,\" she mused as she lifted the lid. \"After all, it worked on number nine and he wasn\u0027t exactly fresh. It\u0027d be nice to have a little backup data for a change.\"\\n\\n She frowned down into the isolation box. The intruder lay, one pale hand curled against his chest, the other palm up at his side. His eyes were closed and long lashes, slightly darker than the strawberry blond hair, brushed against the curve of pale cheeks. He didn\u0027t look dead. Exactly. But he didn\u0027t look alive. Exactly.\\n\\n Head to one side, she pushed his collar back and pressed two fingers into the pulse point at his throat. His flesh responded with more resilience than she\u0027d expected, far more than a corpse would have but, at the same time, it seemed his body temperature had dropped too low to sustain life. She checked to make sure that the refrigeration unit had, indeed, been shut off. It had.\\n\\n \"How very strange,\" she murmured. Then things got stranger still for just as she was about to believe his heart had stopped, for whatever reason, a single pulse throbbed under her fingertips. Frown deepening, she waited, eyes on her watch as the seconds flashed by. Just over eight seconds later, the intruder\u0027s heart beat again. And then eight seconds after that, again.\\n\\n \"About seven beats a minute.\" Catherine drummed the fingers of both hands on the side of the isolation box. \"The alternation of systole and diastole occurs at an average rate of about seventy times per minute in a normal human being at rest. What we have here is a heart beating at one tenth the normal rate.\"\\n\\n Brows knit, she carefully lifted an eyelid between thumb and forefinger. The eye had not rolled back. The pupil, rather than being protected under the ridge of brow bone, remained centered, collapsed to pinprick dimensions. There was no reaction of any kind to light. Nor, for that matter, to any other kind of stimuli by any other part of the body, and Catherine tried them all.\\n\\n Accompanied by low level respiration, the heart continued to beat between seven and eight times a minute, undetectable had she not been specifically searching for it. These were the only signs of life.\\n\\n She\u0027d heard of Indian fakirs putting themselves into trances so deep they appeared to be in comas or dead and she supposed this was a North American variation on that ability; that when her intruder had found himself trapped, he\u0027d lowered his metabolism to conserve resources. Catherine had no idea what he\u0027d been hoping to accomplish as he seemed, at the moment, totally unable to defend himself, but she had to admit that, minor point aside, it was a pretty neat trick.\\n\\n Finally, she had number nine help her remove his leather trench coat and, rolling up his shirtsleeve, she pulled two vials of blood. She\u0027d intended to take three but, with the intruder\u0027s blood pressure so low, two used up all the time she was willing to allow. Closing the box, she headed for one of the tables at the other end of the lab. Running the blood work might give her some answers to this trance thing but, even if it didn\u0027t, she could always use the information later should the intruder happen to die.\\n\\n \"Look, Detective Fergusson, I\u0027m aware that my mother died of natural causes before the crime was committed and I realize that this makes her a very low priority but... \"\\n\\n \"Ms. Nelson.\" Detective Fergusson\u0027s voice hovered between exasperation and annoyance. \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re upset, but I\u0027ve got a murdered teenager on my hands. I\u0027d like to find the asshole who offed him before I\u0027ve got another body bag to deal with.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re the only detective on the force?\" Vicki\u0027s fingernails beat a staccato rhythm against the pay phone\u0027s plastic casing.\\n\\n \"No, but I am the one assigned to the case. I\u0027m sorry if that means I can\u0027t give your mother the attention you think she deserves... \"\\n\\n \"The cases,\" she snarled, fingers curling into a fist, \"are connected.\"\\n\\n Behind her, leaning on the open door of the phone booth, Celluci rolled his eyes. Even without hearing the other end of the conversation, he had some sympathy for Fergusson\u0027s position. Although she could be surgically delicate with a witness, Vicki tended to practice hammer and chisel diplomacy on the rest of the world.\\n\\n \"Connected?\" The exasperation vanished. \"In what way?\"\\n\\n Vicki opened her mouth then closed it again with an audible snap. My mother has been turned into a monster. Your boy was killed by a similar monster. We find my mother, I guarantee we find your perp. How do I know all this? I can\u0027t tell you. And he\u0027s missing anyway.\\n\\n Shit.\\n\\n She shoved at her glasses. \"Look, call it a hunch, okay?\"\\n\\n \"A hunch?\"\\n\\n Realizing that she\u0027d have had much the same reaction had their positions been reversed, her tone grew sharply defensive. \"What\u0027s the matter? You\u0027ve never had a hunch?\"\\n\\n Anticipating disaster should the current conversation continue, Celluci used a shoulder to lever Vicki back from the phone, then dragged the receiver from her grip. Scowling, she allowed his interference with ill grace and the certain knowledge that antagonizing the Kingston Police was a bad idea.\\n\\n \"Detective Fergusson? Detective-Sergeant Celluci. We\u0027ve determined that one of Dr. Burke\u0027s grad students, a Donald Li, at least superficially fits the description of Tom Chen. We\u0027d appreciate it if you could call the registrar\u0027s office and have them release a copy of his student photo so we can check his identity with the funeral parlor.\"\\n\\n Detective Fergusson sighed. \"I called the registrar\u0027s office yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"And they released the photos of the medical students. But Li isn\u0027t studying medicine and they won\u0027t release his picture without another call from you.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you think Li\u0027s involved?\"\\n\\n \"Because he works for Dr. Burke, as did Marjory Nelson.\"\\n\\n \"So. What make you think Dr. Burke\u0027s involved?\"\\n\\n \"Because she appears to have the scientific qualifications to raise the dead as well as access to the necessary equipment.\"\\n\\n \"Give me a break, Sergeant.\" Incredulity fought with anger for control of Fergusson\u0027s voice. \"How did you come up with raising the fucking dead?\"\\n\\n Good question, Celluci admitted, ignoring a glare from Vicki so intense that he could almost feel its impact. Making a quick decision, given that the police were already involved, he pulled out as much of the truth as he thought Fergusson could swallow. \"Ms. Nelson thought she saw her mother outside the apartment window, two nights ago.\"\\n\\n \"Her dead mother?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Walking around?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Next thing you\u0027re going to tell me,\" Fergusson growled, \"is that her dead mother offed my teenie bopper.\"\\n\\n \"No, but... \"\\n\\n \"No buts, Sergeant.\" His voice clipped off the words. \"And I\u0027ve listened to as much of this crap as I\u0027m going to. Go back to Toronto. Get a life. Both of you.\"\\n\\n Celluci got the receiver away from his ear just barely fast enough to save his hearing from the force of Fergusson\u0027s disconnection. He hung up the phone with an equal emphasis. \"I knew I shouldn\u0027t have let you talk to him.\"\\n\\n Behind her lenses, Vicki\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"And you did so much better? What the hell made you tell him about my mother? About Dr. Burke?\"\\n\\n Celluci pushed his way out of the phone booth. She stepped back, giving him just enough room to get by. \"This is science, Vicki, not one of the weird supernatural situations your undead buddy has pulled us into over the last year. I thought he could handle it. I thought he should know.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t think we should discuss it first?\"\\n\\n \"You brought it up. \u0027The cases are connected.\u0027 Jesus H. Christ, Vicki, you knew you couldn\u0027t support a statement like that.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t notice you supporting your statements with much, Celluci.\" With an effort, she unclenched her teeth. \"I assume he\u0027s not going to make the call?\"\\n\\n Celluci\u0027s scowl answered the question. And then some.\\n\\n \"All right.\" She hoisted her bag off the sidewalk and threw it onto her shoulder. \"I guess we do it the hard way.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a lot more philosophical about this than I expected you\u0027d be.\"\\n\\n \"Mike, my recently dead mother has been turned into some kind of grade B movie monster, my...\" what word to use? \"...friend who also happens to be a vampire is missing, in the daylight, and possibly captured. When I sleep, I have nightmares. When I eat, the food turns to rock and just sits there.\" She turned to face him and her expression closed around his heart and squeezed. \"I find it difficult to give a shit that local police don\u0027t see things exactly my way.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve still got me.\" It was the best he could offer.\\n\\n Her lower lip began to tremble and she caught it savagely between her teeth. Unable to trust her voice, she reached up and pushed the long curl of dark brown hair back off his forehead then turned and strode away from the Administration buildings, heels hitting pavement with such force that they should have imprinted crescent moons into the concrete.\\n\\n Celluci watched her for a moment. \"You\u0027re welcome,\" he said quietly, his own voice not entirely steady. With a dozen long strides, he caught up and fell into step by her side.\\n\\n \"All right, Catherine, I\u0027m here.\" Dr. Burke pushed the lab door shut behind her and walked purposefully across the room. \"What is it you\u0027ve found that\u0027s so important I had to see it immediately?\"\\n\\n Catherine came out from behind the computer console and offered a page of printout. \"It\u0027s not that it\u0027s important, precisely, it\u0027s more that I don\u0027t understand what I\u0027ve found. If you could just take a look at the results of this blood work.\"\\n\\n Dr. Burke frowned down at the piece of paper. \"Formed elements sixty percent of whole blood, that\u0027s high. Plasma proteins, twelve percent, high as well. Organic nutrients... \" She looked up. \"Catherine, what is this?\"\\n\\n Catherine shook her head. \"Read the rest.\"\\n\\n Although inclined to demand an immediate explanation, respect for the grad student\u0027s abilities, manipulating the younger woman\u0027s genius had, after all, been a main component of the plan from the beginning, dropped Dr. Burke\u0027s gaze back down to the printout. \"Ten million red blood cells per cubic millimeter of blood? That\u0027s twice human norm.\" Her brows drew in as she continued. \"If this data on the hemoglobin is correct... \"\\n\\n \"It is.\"\\n\\n \"Then just what is this?\" Dr. Burke punctuated her questions by shoving the paper back into Catherine\u0027s hands. \"A replacement for the nutrient solution?\"\\n\\n \"No, although... \" Her eyes glazed and two spots of color began to come up on pale cheeks.\\n\\n Dr. Burke recognized the signs, but she didn\u0027t have the time to allow genius to percolate. She\u0027d had to reschedule an end of term meeting to come here and she had no intention of falling farther behind. \"Think about it later. I\u0027m waiting.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Well... \" Catherine took a deep breath and smoothed down the front of her lab coat. She hadn\u0027t even begun to consider the experimental applications yet. The ability to leap so far ahead, she mused, was what made Dr. Burke such a brilliant scientist. \"We had an intruder in the lab last night.\"\\n\\n \"A what!\"\\n\\n Catherine blinked at both volume and tone. \"An intruder. But don\u0027t worry, number nine took care of him.\"\\n\\n \"Number nine took care of him?\" Dr. Burke suddenly saw her world becoming infinitely more complicated. She shot a disgusted glance across the room to where both number nine and Marj... and number ten sat motionless by the wall. \"The way he, it, took care of that boy?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no! He captured the intruder, and with only the most basic of instructions. There really can be no more doubt that he\u0027s reasoning independently, although I haven\u0027t had time this morning to run a new EEC.\"\\n\\n \"Catherine, that\u0027s fascinating I\u0027m sure, but the intruder? What did you do with him?\"\\n\\n \"I locked him into number nine\u0027s isolation box.\"\\n\\n \"Is he still in there?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. He made a horrible racket at first, very distracting while I was working, especially since I had to do the whole job alone, but he quieted around sunrise.\"\\n\\n \"Quieted.\" Dr. Burke rubbed at her temples where an incipient headache had begun to pound. Thank God, Catherine had been mucking about in the lab long after the rest of the world had gone to sleep. Had there been no one around to stop him, they would have all very likely been in a great deal of trouble. On the other hand, Catherine stopping an intruder was a mixed blessing, her grip on the world\u0027s standard operating procedures not being particularly strong. \"He didn\u0027t die, did he? I mean you did check on him?\" And if he\u0027s alive, what the hell are we going to do with him?\\n\\n \"Of course I did. His metabolic rate is extremely low, but he\u0027s alive.\" She held the printout higher. \"This is a partial analysis of his blood.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s impossible,\" Dr. Burke snapped. With a captured intruder to deal with, she didn\u0027t have time for the grad student\u0027s delusions.\\n\\n Catherine merely shook her head. \"No, it isn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"No one has blood like that. You had to have done something wrong.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Then the sample was contaminated.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Unable to break past Catherine\u0027s calm certainty, Dr. Burke snatched the printout back and glared down at it, scanning the data she\u0027d already read, looking more closely at the rest. \"What\u0027s this? This isn\u0027t blood work.\"\\n\\n \"I also did a cheek swab.\"\\n\\n \"Your intruder has thromboplastins present in his saliva? That\u0027s ridiculous.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not my intruder,\" Catherine protested. \"And if you don\u0027t trust my results, run the tests yourself. Besides, if you\u0027ll notice, they don\u0027t exactly register as thromboplastins although there is a ninety-eight point seven percent similarity.\"\\n\\n \"No one has that kind of clotting initiators in their sa... \" Ten million red blood cells per cubic millimeter of blood... thromboplastins present in his saliva... he quieted around sunrise... his metabolic rate is extremely low... quieted around sunrise... around sunrise... . \"No, that\u0027s impossible.\"\\n\\n Eyes narrowed, Catherine squared her shoulders. She couldn\u0027t understand how Dr. Burke continued to deny the experimental results. Science didn\u0027t lie. \"Obviously, it isn\u0027t impossible.\"\\n\\n Dr. Burke ignored her. Heart pounding, she turned toward the row of isolation boxes. \"I think,\" she said slowly, \"I\u0027d better have a look at your intruder.\"\\n\\n \"He isn\u0027t my intruder,\" Catherine muttered again as she followed the other woman across the room.\\n\\n Palms resting on the curve of number nine\u0027s isolation box, apparently no longer only number nine\u0027s, Dr. Burke told herself she was letting fantasy get the best of both common sense and education. He can\u0027t be what evidence suggests he is. Such creatures exist in myth and legend. They aren\u0027t walking around in the twentieth century. But if the test results were accurate... There\u0027s probably a perfectly normal, scientific explanation for all this, she told herself firmly, and opened the lid.\\n\\n \"Good Lord, he\u0027s paler than you are. I didn\u0027t think that was possible.\" She hadn\u0027t expected him to look so young. Much as Catherine had done earlier, she pushed her fingers up against the pulse point at the base of the ivory column of throat. Thirty seconds passed while she stood silently, eyes on her watch, then she wet her lips and said, \"Not quite eight beats a minute.\"\\n\\n \"I got the same,\" Catherine nodded, pleased to have her figure corroborated.\\n\\n She reached to check his pupils but instead, her hand moving almost of its own volition, she peeled up a lip barely tinted with color.\\n\\n Catherine\u0027s brow furrowed. \"What are you looking for?\"\\n\\n Her heart beat so loudly she nearly missed the question. \"Fangs,\" she said softly, realizing she was being one hundred sorts of an old fool. \"Fangs.\"\\n\\n Bending forward, Catherine peered down at the exposed line of white. \"Although the canines are somewhat prominent, I wouldn\u0027t go so far as to... \"\\n\\n \"Son of a bitch! They\u0027re sharp!\"\\n\\n Together, the two women watched the drop of blood roll from the puncture in Dr. Burke\u0027s finger. It splashed crimson against the barrier of the teeth, seeped into sculpted crevices, drained into the mouth beneath. So slowly that they would have missed the movement had they not been staring so hard, the young man swallowed.\\n\\n In the long moment that followed, Dr. Burke reviewed a thousand rational reasons why this creature could not be what it had to be. Finally, she said, \"Catherine, do you realize what we have here?\"\\n\\n \"Incipient percutaneous infection. Better sterilize the puncture.\"\\n\\n \"No, no, no. Do know what he is?\"\\n\\n \"No, Doctor.\" Catherine rocked back on her heels and shoved her hands deep into the pockets of her lab coat. \"I realized I didn\u0027t know what he was when I saw the results of the blood work. That\u0027s why I called you.\"\\n\\n \"This,\" Dr. Burke\u0027s voice rose with an excitement she didn\u0027t bother to suppress, \"is a vampire!\" She whirled to face Catherine, who looked politely interested. \"Good lord, girl, don\u0027t you find that amazing? That this is a vampire? And we have him?\"\\n\\n \"I guess.\"\\n\\n \"You guess?\" Dr. Burke stared at the grad student in disbelief. \"We have a vampire break into the lab and you guess it\u0027s amazing?\"\\n\\n Catherine shrugged.\\n\\n \"Catherine! Pull your head out of your test tubes and consider what this means. Up until this moment, vampires were creatures of myth and legend. We can now prove that they exist!\"\\n\\n \"I thought vampires disintegrated in daylight.\"\\n\\n \"He hasn\u0027t been in daylight, has he?\" An expansive gesture indicated the wall of boarded up windows. \"The scientific community will go crazy over this!\"\\n\\n \"If he is a vampire. So far we can only prove he has a hyperefficient bloodtype, clotting agents in his saliva, and sharp teeth.\"\\n\\n \"And doesn\u0027t that say vampire to you?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it doesn\u0027t prove it. Sunrise may have caused his metabolic rate to drop, but we can\u0027t actually prove that either.\" She frowned. \"I suppose we could push him up against an open window and see what happens.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" Dr. Burke took a deep breath and leaned back against number eight\u0027s isolation box, allowing the soft vibration of the machinery to soothe her jangled nerves. \"This is a vampire. I\u0027m as certain of it as I\u0027ve ever been of anything in my life. You saw how he reacted to my blood.\"\\n\\n \"That was pretty strange.\"\\n\\n \"Strange? It was incredible.\" With her left hand supporting the vampire\u0027s hip, he was heavier than she expected, she slid her right hand into his pants pocket and pulled out a slim, black leather wallet. \"Now then, let\u0027s find out who you are.\"\\n\\n \"Would a vampire carry identification?\"\\n\\n \"Why not? This is the twentieth century. Everyone carries identification of some kind. Here we are; Henry Fitzroy. I suppose they can\u0027t all be named Vladimir.\" Lips pursed and eyes gleaming, Dr. Burke turned over a gold patterned credit card. \"Don\u0027t leave the crypt without it, as Donald would probably say. Speaking of Donald... \" She paused and frowned. \"Where is he, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you see... \" Catherine laid a gentle hand on number eight\u0027s isolation box. \"He... \"\\n\\n \"Has that damned tutorial this morning, doesn\u0027t he? And I expect he was long gone before our visitor showed up. It\u0027s his loss, you\u0027ll have to fill him in later. Now then, ownership, insurance, ah, driver\u0027s license. Apparently the myth that vampires show no photographic image is also false.\"\\n\\n \"I just can\u0027t believe we have vampires in Kingston.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t. He\u0027s from Toronto.\" Gathering up the contents of the wallet, Dr. Burke tossed them onto a pile of clothes draped over a nearby chair. \"We\u0027ll have to do something about his car... no, we don\u0027t. He\u0027ll just disappear. Become another tragic statistic. He\u0027s already living a lie; who\u0027s going to look for him?\"\\n\\n She patted the back of one pale hand, fingers lightly stroking the scattering of red-gold hair. \"Of all the laboratories in all the world, you had to stumble into mine.\"\\n\\n \"But, Dr. Burke, what are we going to do with him?\"\\n\\n \"Study him, Catherine. Study him.\"\\n\\n Head cocked to one side, Catherine examined the doctor. The last time she\u0027d seen the older woman this excited had been the day number four had made the initial breakthrough with the neural net. Her eyes had held the same brilliant mix of greed and self-satisfaction then that they did now and, now that she thought about it, Catherine hadn\u0027t liked the expression that day either. \"Dr. Burke, vampires are outside my experimental parameters.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-pact-vicki-nelson-4/page-10.html","bookId":2467,"book":{"id":2467,"title":"Blood Pact (Vicki Nelson #4)","description":"Storyline: Blood Pact (Vicki Nelson #4) \\n It began with the call no daughter ever wants to get, the call that told private investigator Vicki Nelson her mother had died.
