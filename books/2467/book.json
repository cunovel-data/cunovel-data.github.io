Mrs. Nelson\u0027s coworker at the Queen\u0027s University Life Science Department told Vicki that the cause of death was a heart attack, and that they\u0027d be waiting for her to arrive in Kingston to make the funeral arrangements. But what started as an all too normal personal tragedy soon became the most terrifying case of Vicki\u0027s career. For when Marjory Nelson\u0027s body mysteriously disappeared from the funeral home, Vicki, her sometime lover and fellow investigator, vampire Henry Fitzroy, and her former homicide squad partner, Detective-Sergeant Mike Celluci, realized that there was something unnatural about her mother\u0027s demise. Vicki swore she\u0027d find the culprit, and see that her mother was properly laid to rest. But what she hadn\u0027t counted on was that someone at Queen\u0027s University seemed determined to keep Mrs. Nelson on the job -- alive or dead!\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blood-pact-vicki-nelson-4.jpg","author":"Tanya Huff","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":16,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
