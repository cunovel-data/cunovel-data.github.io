{"id":989,"no":15,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 13","content":"How can I solve some of the health problems I face? I have been the victim of enough chronic problems to last three lifetimes. Why am I having them all now—in this lifetime?\\n\\n \\n\\n First, let’s get one thing straight. You love them. Most of them, anyway. You’ve used them admirably to feel sorry for yourself and to get attention for yourself.\\n\\n On the few occasions when you haven’t loved them, it’s only because they’ve gone too far. Farther than you thought they ever would when you created them.\\n\\n Now let’s understand what you probably already know: all illness is self-created. Even conventional medical doctors are now seeing how people make themselves sick.\\n\\n Most people do so quite unconsciously. (They don’t even know what they’re doing.) So when they get sick, they don’t know what hit them. It feels as though something has befallen them, rather than that they did something to themselves.\\n\\n This occurs because most people move through life—not simply health issues and consequences—un-consciously.\\n\\n People smoke and wonder why they get cancer.\\n\\n People ingest animals and fat and wonder why they get blocked arteries.\\n\\n People stay angry all their lives and wonder why they get heart attacks.\\n\\n People compete with other people—mercilessly and under incredible stress—and wonder why they have strokes.\\n\\n The not-so-obvious truth is that most people worry themselves to death.\\n\\n \\n\\n Worry is just about the worst form of mental activity there is—next to hate, which is deeply self destructive. Worry is pointless. It is wasted mental energy. It also creates bio-chemical reactions which harm the body, producing everything from indigestion to coronary ar-rest, and a multitude of things in between.\\n\\n Health will improve almost at once when worrying ends.\\n\\n Worry is the activity of a mind which does not understand its connection with Me.\\n\\n Hatred is the most severely damaging mental con-dition. It poisons the body, and its effects are virtually irreversible.\\n\\n Fear is the opposite of everything you are, and so has an effect of opposition to your mental and physical health. Fear is worry magnified.\\n\\n Worry, hate, fear—together with their offshoots:\\n\\n anxiety, bitterness, impatience, avarice, unkindness, judgmentalness, and condemnation—all attack the body at the cellular level. It is impossible to have a healthy body under these conditions.\\n\\n Similarly—although to a somewhat lesser de-gree—conceit, self-indulgence, and greed lead to physical illness, or lack of well-being.\\n\\n All illness is created first in the mind.\\n\\n \\n\\n How can that be? What of conditions contracted from another? Colds—or, for that matter, AIDS?\\n\\n \\n\\n Nothing occurs in your life—nothing—which is not first a thought. Thoughts are like magnets, drawing effects to you. The thought may not always be obvious, and thus clearly causative, as in, “I’m going to contract a terrible disease.” The thought may be (and usually is) far more subtle than that. (“I am not worthy to live.”) (“My life is always a mess.”) (“I am a loser.”) (“God is going to punish me.”) (“1 am sick and tired of my life! “)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Thoughts are a very subtle, yet extremely powerful, form of energy. Words are less subtle, more dense. Actions are the most dense of all. Action is energy in heavy physical form, in heavy motion. When you think, say, and act out a negative concept such as “I am a loser,” you place tremendous creative energy into mo-tion. Small wonder you come down with a cold. That would be the least of it.\\n\\n It is very difficult to reverse the effects of negative thinking once they have taken physical form. Not im-possible—but very difficult. It takes an act of extreme faith. It requires an extraordinary belief in the positive force of the universe-whether you call that God, Goddess, the Unmoved Mover, Prime Force, First Cause, or whatever.\\n\\n Healers have just such faith. It is a faith that crosses over into Absolute Knowing. They know that you are meant to be whole, complete, and perfect in this moment now. This knowingness is also a thought—and a very powerful one. It has the power to move mountains—to say nothing of molecules in your body. That is why healers can heal, often even at a distance.\\n\\n Thought knows no distance. Thought travels around the world and traverses the universe faster than you can say the word.\\n\\n “Say but the word and my servant shall be healed.” And it was so, in that selfsame hour, even before his sentence was finished. Such was the faith of the centurion.\\n\\n Yet you are all mental lepers. Your mind is eaten away with negative thoughts. Some of these are thrust upon you. Many of these you actually make up—con-jure up—yourselves, and then harbor and entertain for hours, days, weeks, months—even years.\\n\\n .and you wonder why you are sick.\\n\\n You can “solve some of the health problems,” as you put it, by solving the problems in your thinking. Yes, you can heal some of the conditions you have already acquired (given yourself), as well as prevent major new problems from developing. And you can do this all by changing your thinking.\\n\\n \\n\\n Also—and I hate to suggest this because it sounds so mundane coming, as it were, from God, but—for God’s sake, take better care of yourself.\\n\\n You take rotten care of your body, paying it little attention at all until you suspect something’s going wrong with it. You do virtually nothing in the way of preventive maintenance. You take better care of your car than you do of your body—and that’s not saying much.\\n\\n Not only do you fail to prevent breakdowns with regular check-ups, once-a-year physicals, and use of the therapies and medicines you’ve been given (why do you go to the doctor, get her help, then not use the remedies she suggests? Can you answer Me that one?)—you also mistreat your body terribly between these visits about which you do nothing!\\n\\n You do not exercise it, so it grows flabby and, worse yet, weak from non-use.\\n\\n You do not nourish it properly, thereby weakening it further.\\n\\n Then you fill it with toxins and poisons and the most absurd substances posing as food. And still it runs for you, this marvelous engine; still it chugs along, bravely pushing on in the face of this on-slaught.\\n\\n It’s horrible. The conditions under which you ask your body to survive are horrible. But you will do little or nothing about them. You will read this, nod your head in regretful agreement, and go right back to the mistreatment. And do you know why?\\n\\n \\n\\n I’m afraid to ask.\\n\\n \\n\\n Because you have no will to live.\\n\\n \\n\\n That seems a harsh indictment.\\n\\n \\n\\n It’s not meant to be harsh, nor is it meant as an indictment. “Harsh” is a relative term; a judgment you have laid on the words. “Indictment” connotes guilt, and “guilt” connotes wrongdoing. There is no wrong-doing involved here, hence no guilt and no indictment.\\n\\n I have made a simple statement of truth. Like all statements of truth, it has the quality of waking you up. Some people don’t like to be awakened. Most do not. Most would rather sleep.\\n\\n The world is in the condition that it’s in because the world is full of sleepwalkers.\\n\\n With regard to my statement, what about it seems untrue? You have no will to live. At least you have had none until now.\\n\\n If you tell me you’ve had an “instant conversion,” I will reassess my prediction of whatyou will now do. I acknow-ledge that my prediction is based on past experience.\\n\\n .it was also meant to wake you up. Sometimes, when a person is really deeply asleep, you have to shake\\n\\n \\n\\n I have seen in the past that you have had little will to live. Now you may deny that, but in this case your actions speak louder than your words.\\n\\n If you ever lit a cigarette in your life—much less smoked a pack a day for 20 years as you have—you have very little will to live. You don’t care what you do to your body.\\n\\n \\n\\n But I stopped smoking over 10 years ago!\\n\\n \\n\\n Only after 20 years of grueling physical punishment.\\n\\n And if you’ve ever taken alcohol into your body, you have very little will to live.\\n\\n \\n\\n I drink very moderately.\\n\\n \\n\\n The body was not meant to intake alcohol. It impairs the mind.\\n\\n \\n\\n But Jesus took alcohol! He went to the wedding and turned water into wine!\\n\\n \\n\\n So who said jesus was perfect?\\n\\n \\n\\n Oh, for God’s sake.\\n\\n \\n\\n Say, are you becoming annoyed with Me?\\n\\n \\n\\n Well, far be it from me to become annoyed with God. I mean, that would be a bit presumptuous, wouldn’t it? But I do think we can carry all this a bit too far. My father taught me, “all things in moderation.” I think I’ve stuck to that where alcohol is concerned.\\n\\n \\n\\n The body can more easily recover from only mod-erate abuse. The saying is therefore useful. Neverthe-less, I’ll stick to my original statement: the body was not meant to intake alcohol.\\n\\n \\n\\n But even some medicines contain alcohol!\\n\\n \\n\\n I have no control over what you call medicine. I’ll stay with my statement.\\n\\n \\n\\n You really are rigid, aren’t You?\\n\\n \\n\\n Look, truth is truth. Now if someone said “A little alcohol won’t hurt you,” and placed that statement in the context of life as you now live it, I would have to agree with them. Thatdoes not change the truth of what I’ve said. It simply allows you to ignore it.\\n\\n Yet consider this. Currently, you humans wear your bodies out, typically, within 50 to 80 years. Some last longer, but not many. Some stop functioning sooner, but not the majority. Can we agree on that?\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, okay.\\n\\n \\n\\n Alright, so we have a good starting point for discus-sion. Now, when I said I could agree with the statement “A little alcohol won’t hurt you,” I qualified that by adding “in the context of life as you now live it.” You see, you people seem satisfied with life as you now live it. But life, it may surprise you to learn, was meant to be lived a whole different way. And your body was designed to last a great deal longer.\\n\\n \\n\\n It was?\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes.\\n\\n \\n\\n How much longer?\\n\\n \\n\\n Infinitely longer.\\n\\n \\n\\n What does that mean?\\n\\n \\n\\n It means, My son, your body was designed to last forever.\\n\\n \\n\\n Forever?\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes. Read that: “for ever more.”\\n\\n \\n\\n You mean we were—are—never supposed to die?\\n\\n \\n\\n You never do die. Life is eternal. You are immortal. You never do die. You simply change form. You didn’t even have to do that. You decided to do that, I didn’t. I made you bodies that would last forever. Do you really think the best God could do, the best I could come up with, was a body that could make it 60, 70, maybe 80 years before falling apart? Is that, do you imagine, the limit of My ability?\\n\\n \\n\\n I never thought of putting it that way, exactly...\\n\\n \\n\\n I designed your magnificent body to last forever! And the earliest of you did live in the body virtually pain-free, and without fear of what you now call death.\\n\\n In your religious mythology, you symbolize your cellular memory of these first-version humans by calling them Adam and Eve. Actually, of course, there were more than two.\\n\\n At the outset, the idea was for you wonderful souls to have a chance to know your Selves as Who You Really Are through experiences gained n the physical body, in the relative world—as I have explained repeatedly here.\\n\\n \\n\\n This was done through the slowing down of the unfathomable speed of all vibration (thought form) to produce matter—including that matter you call the physical body.\\n\\n Life evolved through a series of steps in the blink of an eye that you now call billions of years. And in this holy instant came you, out of the sea, the water of life, onto the land and into the form you now hold.\\n\\n \\n\\n Then the evolutionists are right!\\n\\n \\n\\n I find it amusing—a source of continual amusement, actually—that you humans have such a need to break everything down into right and wrong. It never occurs to you that you’ve made those labels up to help you define the material—and your Self.\\n\\n It never occurs to you (except to the finest minds among you) that a thing could be both right and wrong; that only in the relative world are things one or the other. In the world of the absolute, of time-no time, all things are everything.\\n\\n There is no male and female, there is no before and after, there is no fast and slow, here and there, up and down, left and right—and no right and wrong.\\n\\n \\n\\n Your astronauts and cosmonauts have gained a sense of this. They imagined themselves to be rocketing upward to get to outer space, only to find when they got there that they were looking up at the Earth. Or were they? Maybe they were looking down at the Earth! But then, where was the sun? Up? Down? No! Over there, to the left. So now, suddenly, a thing was neither up nor down—it was sideways. . .and all definitions thus dis-appeared.\\n\\n So it is in My world—our world—our real realm. All definitions disappear, rendering it difficult to even talk about this realm in definitive terms.\\n\\n Religion is your attempt to speak of the unspeakable. It does not do a very good job.\\n\\n No, My son, the evolutionists are not right. I created all of this—all of this—in the blink of an eye; in one holy instant—just as the creationists have said. And. . .it came about through a process of evolution taking bil-lions and billions of what you call years, just as the evolutionists claim.\\n\\n They are both “right.” As the cosmonauts discov-ered, it all depends on how you look at it.\\n\\n But the real question is: one holy instantlbillions of years-what’s the difference? Can you simply agree that on some of the questions of life the mystery is too great for even you to solve? Why not hold the mystery as sacred? And why not allow the sacred to be sacred, and leave it alone?\\n\\n \\n\\n I suppose we all have an insatiable need to know.\\n\\n \\n\\n But you already know! I’ve just told you! Yet you don’t want to know the Truth, you want to know the truth as you understand it. This is the greatest barrier to your enlightenment. You think you already know the truth! You think you already understand how it is. So you agree with everything you see or hear or read that falls into the paradigm of your understanding, and reject everything which does not. And this you call learning.\\n\\n \\n\\n This you call being open to the teachings. Alas, you can never be open to the teachings so long as you are closed to everything save your own truth.\\n\\n Thus will this very book be called blasphemy—the work of the devil—by some.\\n\\n Yet those who have ears to hear, let them listen. I tell you this: You were not meant to ever die. Your physical form was created as a magnificent conven-ience; a wonderful tool; a glorious vehicle allowing you to experience the reality you have created with your mind, that you may know the Self you have created in your soul.\\n\\n The soul conceives, the mind creates, the body experiences. The circle is complete. The soul then knows itself in its own experience. If it does not like what it is experiencing (feeling), or wishes a different experience for any reason, it simply conceives of a new experience of Self, and, quite literally, changes its mind.\\n\\n Soon the body finds itself in a new experience. (“1 am the resurrection and the Life” was a magnificent example of this. How do you think Jesus did it anyway? Or do you not believe it ever happened? Believe it. It happened!)\\n\\n Yet this much is so: the soul will never override the body or the mind. I made you as a three-in-one being. You are three beings in one, made in the image and likeness of Me.\\n\\n The three aspects of Self are in no wise unequal to each other. Each has a function, but no function is greater than another, nor does any function actually precede another. All are interrelated in an exactly equal way.\\n\\n Conceive—create—experience. What you con-ceive you create, what you create you experience, what you experience you conceive.\\n\\n That is why it is said, if you can cause your body to experience something (take abundance, for example), you will soon have the feeling of it in your soul, which will conceive of itself in a new way (namely, abundant), thus presenting your mind with a new thought about that. From the new thought springs more experience, and the body begins living a new reality as a permanent state of being.\\n\\n Your body, your mind, and your soul (spirit) are one.\\n\\n In this, you are a microcosm of Me—the Divine All, the\\n\\n Holy Everything, the Sum and Substance. You see now\\n\\n how I am the beginning and the end of everything, the\\n\\n Alpha and the Omega.\\n\\n Now I will explain to you the ultimate mystery: your exact and true relationship to Me.\\n\\n \\n\\n As your body is to your mind and soul, so, too, are you to My mind and soul. Therefore:\\n\\n Everything I experience, I experience through you.\\n\\n Just as your body, mind, and spirit are one, so, too, are Mine.\\n\\n So it is that Jesus of Nazareth, among the many who understood this mystery, spoke immutable truth when he said, “1 and the Father are One.”\\n\\n Now I will tell you, there are even larger truths than this to which you will one day become privy. For even as you are the body of Me, I am the body of another.\\n\\n \\n\\n You mean, You are not God?\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, I am God, as you now understand Him. I am Goddess as you now comprehend Her. I am the Con-ceiver and the Creator of Everything you now know and experience, and you are My children. . .even as I am the child of another.\\n\\n \\n\\n Are You trying to tell me that even God has a God?\\n\\n \\n\\n I am telling you that your perception of ultimate reality is more limited than you thought, and that Truth is more unlimited than you can imagine.\\n\\n \\n\\n I am giving you ever-so-small a glimpse of infinity— and infinite love. (A much larger glimpse and you could not hold it in your reality. You can barely hold this.)\\n\\n \\n\\n Wait a minute! You mean I’m really not talking with God here?\\n\\n \\n\\n I have told you—if you conceive of God as your creator and master-even as you are the creator and master of your own body—I am the Cod of your understanding. And you are talking with Me, yes. It has been a delicious conversation, no?\\n\\n \\n\\n Delicious or not, I thought I was talking with the real God. The God of Gods. You know—the top guy, the chief honcho.\\n\\n \\n\\n You are. Believe Me. You are.\\n\\n \\n\\n And yet You say that there is someone above You in this hierarchal scheme of things.\\n\\n \\n\\n We are now trying to do the impossible, which is to speak of the unspeakable. As I said, that is what religion seeks to do. Let Me see if I can find a way to summarize this.\\n\\n Forever is longer than you know. Eternal is longer than Forever. God is more than you imagine. God is the energy you call imagination. God is creation. Cod is first thought. And God is last experience. And God is every-thing in between.\\n\\n Have you ever looked down a high-powered micro-scope, or seen pictures or movies of molecular action, and said, “Good heavens, there’s a whole universe down there. And to that universe, I, the now-present observer, must feel like God!” Have you ever said that, or had that kind of experience?\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, I should imagine every thinking person has.\\n\\n \\n\\n Indeed. You have given yourself your own glimpse of what I am showing you here.\\n\\n And what would you do if I told you that this reality of which you have given yourself a glimpse never ends?\\n\\n \\n\\n Explain that. I’d ask You to explain that.\\n\\n \\n\\n Take the smallest part of the universe you can imagine. Imagine this tiny, tiny particle of matter.\\n\\n \\n\\n Okay.\\n\\n \\n\\n Now cut it in half.\\n\\n \\n\\n Okay.\\n\\n \\n\\n What have you got?\\n\\n \\n\\n Two smaller halves.\\n\\n \\n\\n Precisely. Now cut those in half. What now?\\n\\n \\n\\n Two smaller halves.\\n\\n \\n\\n Right. Now again, and again! What’s left? Smaller and smaller particles.\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, but when does it stop? How many times can you divide matter until it ceases to exist?\\n\\n \\n\\n I don’t know. I guess it never ceases to exist.\\n\\n \\n\\n You mean you can never completely destroy it? All you can do is change its form?\\n\\n \\n\\n It would seem so.\\n\\n \\n\\n I tell you this: you have just learned the secret of all of life, and seen into infinity.\\n\\n Now I have a question to ask you.\\n\\n \\n\\n Okay...\\n\\n \\n\\n What makes you think infinity goes only one way? — So. . .there is no end going up, any more than there is going\\n\\n down.\\n\\n \\n\\n There is no up or down, but I understand your meaning.\\n\\n \\n\\n But if there is no end to smallness, that means there is no end to bigness.\\n\\n \\n\\n Correct.\\n\\n \\n\\n But if there is no end to bigness, then there is no biggest. That means, in the largest sense, there is no God!\\n\\n \\n\\n Or, perhaps—all of it is God, and there is nothing else.\\n\\n \\n\\n I tell you this: I AM THAT I AM.\\n\\n And YOU ARE THAT YOU ARE. You cannot not be. You can change form all you wish, but you cannot fail to be. Yet you can fail to know Who You Are—and in this failing, experience only the half of it.\\n\\n \\n\\n That would be hell.\\n\\n \\n\\n Exactly. Yet you are not condemned to it. You are not relegated to it forevermore. All that it takes to get out of hell—to get out of not knowing—is to know again.\\n\\n \\n\\n There are many ways and many places (dimensions) in which you can do this.\\n\\n You are in one of those dimensions now. It is called, in your understanding, the third dimension.\\n\\n \\n\\n And there are many more?\\n\\n \\n\\n Have I not told you that in My Kingdom there are many mansions? I would not have told it to you were it not so.\\n\\n \\n\\n Then there is no hell—not really. I mean, there is no place or dimension to which we are everlastingly condemned!\\n\\n \\n\\n What would be the purpose of that?\\n\\n Yet you are always limited by your know-ingness—for you—we—are a self-created being.\\n\\n You cannot be what you do not know your Self to be.\\n\\n That is why you have been given this life—so that you might know yourself in your own experience. Then you can conceive of yourself as Who You Really Are, and create yourself as that in your experience—and the circle is again complete. . .only bigger.\\n\\n And so, you are in the process of growing—or, as I have put it throughout this book, of becoming.\\n\\n There is no limit to what you can become.\\n\\n \\n\\n You mean, I can even become—dare I say it?—a God. . .just like You?\\n\\n \\n\\n What do you think?\\n\\n \\n\\n I don’t know.\\n\\n \\n\\n Until you do, you cannot. Remember the triangle— the Holy Trinity: spirit-mind-body. Conceive-create--experience. Remember, using your symbology:\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n HOLY SPIRIT \u003d INSPIRATION \u003d CONCEIVE\\n\\n \\n\\n FATHER \u003d PARENTING \u003d CREATE\\n\\n \\n\\n SON \u003d OFFSPRING \u003d EXPERIENCE\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n The Son experiences the creation of the fathering thought, which is conceived of by the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n Can you conceive of yourself as one day being a Cod?\\n\\n \\n\\n In my wildest moments.\\n\\n \\n\\n Good, for I tell you this: You are already a Cod. You simply do not know it.\\n\\n Have I not said, “Ye are Cods”?\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/597.html","bookId":36,"book":{"id":36,"title":"与神对话 Conversations With God","description":"简介： Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Religious","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
