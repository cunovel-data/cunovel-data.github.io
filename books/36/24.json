{"id":998,"no":24,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 6","content":"Tell me about space.\n \n Space is time . . . demonstrated.\n In truth there is no such thing as space—pure, “empty” space, with nothing in it. Everything is some-thing. Even the “emptiest” space is filled with vapors so thin, so stretched out over infinite areas, that they seem to not be there.\n Then, after the vapors are gone, there is energy. Pure energy. This manifests as vibration. Oscillations. Move-ments of the All at a particular frequency.\n Invisible “energy” is the “space” which holds “mat-ter together.”\n Once—using your linear time as a model—all the matter in the universe was condensed into a tiny speck. You cannot imagine the denseness of this—but that is because you think that matter as it now exists is dense.\n \n Actually, what you now call matter is mostly space. All “solid” objects are 2 percent solid “matter” and 98 percent “air”! The space between the tiniest particles of matter in all objects is enormous. It is something like the distance between heavenly bodies in your night sky. Yet these objects you call solid.\n At one point the entire universe actually was “solid.” There was virtually no space between the particles of matter. All the matter had the “space” taken out of it—and with the enormous “space” gone, that matter filled an area smaller than the head of a pin.\n There was actually a “time” before that “time” when there was no matter at all—just the purest form of Highest Vibration Energy, which you would call anti-matter.\n This was the time “before” time—before the physical universe as you know it existed. Nothing\n existed as matter. Some people conceive of this as paradise, or “heaven,” because “nothing was the matter”!\n \n (It is no accident that today in your language, when you suspect something is wrong, you say, “What’s the matter?”)\n In the beginning, pure energy—Me!—vibrated, os-cillated, so fast as to form matter—all the matter of the universe!\n You, too, can perform the same feat. In fact, you do, every day. Your thoughts are pure vibration—and they can and do create physical matter! If enough of you hold the same thought, you can impact, and even create, portions of your physical universe. This was explained to you in detail in Book 1.\n \n Is the universe now expanding?\n \n At a rate of speed you cannot imagine!\n \n Will it expand forever?\n \n No. There will come a time when the energies driving the expansion will dissipate, and the energies holding things together will take over—pulling every-thing “back together” again.\n \n You mean the universe will contract?\n \n Yes. Everything will, quite literally, “fall into place”! And you’ll have paradise again. No matter. Pure energy.\n In other words—Me!\n In the end, it’ll all come back to Me. That is the origin of your phrase: “It all comes down to this.”\n \n That means that we will no longer exist!\n \n Not in physical form. But you will always exist. You cannot not exist. You are that which Is.\n \n What will happen after the universe “collapses”?\n \n The whole process will start over again! There will be another so-called Big Bang, and another universe will be born.\n It will expand and contract. And then it will do the same thing all over again. And again. And again. Forever and ever. World without end.\n This is the breathing in and breathing out of God.\n \n Well, this is all, again, very interesting—but it has very little to do with my everyday life.\n \n As I said before, spending an inordinate amount of time trying to unravel the deepest mysteries of the universe is probably not the most efficient use of your life. Yet there are benefits to be gained from these simple layman’s allegories and descriptions of the Larger Process.\n \n Like what?\n \n Like understanding that all things are cyclical—in-cluding life itself.\n Understanding about the life of the universe will help you to understand about the life of the universe inside you.\n Life moves in cycles. Everything is cyclical. Every-thing. When you understand this, you become more able to enjoy the Process—not merely endure it.\n All things move cyclically. There is a natural rhythm to life, and everything moves to that rhythm; everything goes with that flow. Thus it is written: “For everything there is a season; and a time for every Purpose under Heaven.”\n Wise is the one who understands this. Clever is the one who uses it.\n Few people understand the rhythms of life more than women. Women live their whole lives by rhythm. They are in rhythm with life itself.\n Women are more able to “go with the flow” than men. Men want to push, pull, resist, direct the flow. Women experience it—then mold with it to produce harmony.\n \n A woman hears the melody of flowers in the wind. She sees the beauty of the Unseen. She feels the tugs and pulls and urges of life. She knows when it is time to run, and time to rest; time to laugh and time to cry; time to hold on and time to let go.\n Most women leave their bodies gracefully. Most men fight the departure. Women treat their bodies more grace-fully when they are in them, too. Men treat their bodies horribly. That is the same way they treat life.\n Of course, there are exceptions to every rule. I’m speaking here in generalities. I’m speaking of how things have been until now. I’m speaking in the broadest terms. But if you look at life, if you admit to yourself what you are seeing, have seen, if you acknowledge what is so, you may find truth in this generality.\n \n Yet that makes me feel sad. That makes me feel as though women are somehow superior beings. That they have more of the “right stuff” than men.\n \n Part of the glorious rhythm of life is the yin and the yang. One Aspect of “Being” is not “more perfect” or “better” than another. Both aspects are simply—and wonderfully—that: aspects.\n Men, obviously, embody other reflections of Divin-ity, which women eye with equal envy.\n Yet it has been said that being a man is your testing ground, or your probation. When you have been a man long enough—when you have suffered enough through your own foolishness; when you have inflicted enough pain through the calamities of your own creation; when you have hurt others enough to stop your own behav-iors—to replace aggression with reason, contempt with compassion, always-winning with no-one-losing—then you may become a woman.\n When you have learned that might is not “right”; that strength is not power over, but power with; that absolute power demands of others absolutely nothing; when you understand these things, then you may de-serve to wear a woman’s body—for you will at last have understood her’ Essence.\n \n Then a woman is better than a man.\n \n No! Not “better”—different! It is you making that judgment. There is no such thing as “better” or “worse” in objective reality. There is only what Is—and what you wish to Be.\n Hot is no better than cold, up no better than down—a point I have made before. Hence, female is no “better” than male. It just is what it Is. just as you are what you are.\n Yet none of you are restricted, more limited. You can Be what you wish to Be, choose what you wish to experience. In this lifetime or the next, or the next after that—just as you did in the lifetime before. Each of you is always at choice. Each of you is made up of All of It. There is male and female in each of you. Express and experience that aspect of you which it pleases you to express and experience. Yet know that it is all open to each of you.\n \n I don’t want to get off onto other topics. I want to stay with this male-female paradigm for a while longer. You promised at the end of the last book to discuss in much more detail the whole sexual aspect of this duality.\n \n Yes—I think it is time that we talked, you and I, about Sex.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/606.html","bookId":36,"book":{"id":36,"title":"与神对话 Conversations With God","description":"简介： Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Religious","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
