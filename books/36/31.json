Seek to build, not to destroy.\\n\\n Bring My people home.\\n\\n \\n\\n How?\\n\\n \\n\\n By your shining example. Seek only Godliness. Speak only in truthfulness. Act only in love.\\n\\n Live the Law of Love now and forevermore. Give everything, require nothing.\\n\\n Avoid the mundane.\\n\\n Do not accept the unacceptable.\\n\\n Teach all who seek to learn of Me.\\n\\n Make every moment of your life an outpouring of love.\\n\\n Use every moment to think the highest thought, say the highest word, do the highest deed. In this, glorify your Holy Self, and thus, too, glorify Me.\\n\\n Bring peace to the Earth by bringing peace to all those whose lives you touch.\\n\\n Be peace.\\n\\n Feel and express in every moment your Divine Connection with the All, and with every person, place, and thing.\\n\\n \\n\\n Embrace every circumstance, own every fault, share every joy, contemplate every mystery, walk in every man’s shoes, forgive every offense (including your own), heal every heart, honor every person’s truth, adore every person’s God, protect every person’s rights, preserve every person’s dignity, promote every person’s interests, provide every person’s needs, pre-sume every person’s holiness, present every person’s greatest gifts, produce every person’s blessing, and pronounce every person’s future secure in the assured love of God.\\n\\n \\n\\n Be a living, breathing example of the Highest Truth that resides within you.\\n\\n Speak humbly of yourself, lest someone mistake your Highest Truth for a boast.\\n\\n Speak softly, lest someone think you are merely calling for attention.\\n\\n Speak gently, that all might know of Love.\\n\\n Speak openly, lest anyone think you have something to hide.\\n\\n Speak candidly, so you cannot be mistaken.\\n\\n Speak often, so that your word may truly go forth.\\n\\n Speak respectfully, that no one be dishonored.\\n\\n Speak lovingly, that every syllable may heal.\\n\\n Speak of Me with every utterance.\\n\\n Make of your life a gift. Remember always, you are the gift!\\n\\n Be a gift to everyone who enters your life, and to everyone whose life you enter. Be careful not to enter another’s life if you cannot be a gift.\\n\\n (You can always be a gift, because you always are the gift—yet sometimes you don’t let yourself know that.)\\n\\n When someone enters your life unexpectedly, look for the gift that person has come to receive from you.\\n\\n \\n\\n What an extraordinary way of putting it.\\n\\n \\n\\n Why else do you think a person has come to you?\\n\\n I tell you this: every person who has ever come to you has come to receive a gift from you. In so doing, he gives a gift to you—the gift of your experiencing and fulfilling Who You Are.\\n\\n \\n\\n When you see this simple truth, when you under-stand it, you see the greatest truth of all:\\n\\n \\n\\n I HAVE SENT YOU\\n\\n NOTHING BUT ANGELS.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/613.html","bookId":36,"book":{"id":36,"title":"与神对话 Conversations With God","description":"简介： Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Religious","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
