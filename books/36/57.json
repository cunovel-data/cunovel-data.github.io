{"id":1031,"no":57,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 17","content":"Now that’s what I want to hear! That’s what I came here to experience! Inspiration, not degradation.\\n\\n \\n\\n You are never degraded unless you think you are. You are never judged or “made wrong” by God.\\n\\n \\n\\n A lot of people don’t “get” this idea of a God Who says, “There’s no such thing as right and wrong,” and Who pro-claims that we will never be judged.\\n\\n \\n\\n Well, make up your mind! First you say I’m judging you, then you’re upset because I’m not.\\n\\n \\n\\n I know, I know. It’s all very confusing. We’re all very. . . complex. We don’t want Your judgments, but we do. We don’t want Your punishments, yet we feel lost without them. And when You say, as You did in the other two books, “I will never punish you,” we cannot believe that—and some of us almost get mad about that. Because if You’re not going to judge, and punish us, what will keep us walking the straight and narrow? And if there’s no “justice” in heaven, who will undo all the in-justice on Earth?\\n\\n \\n\\n Why are you counting on heaven to correct what you call “injustice”~ Do not the rains fall from the heav-ens?\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes.\\n\\n \\n\\n And I tell you this: The rain falls on the just and the unjust alike.\\n\\n \\n\\n But what about, “Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord”?\\n\\n \\n\\n I never said that. One of you made that up, and the rest of you believed it.\\n\\n “justice” is not something you experience after you act a certain way, but because you act a certain way. Justice is an act, not punishment for an act.\\n\\n \\n\\n I see that the problem with our society is that we seek “jus-tice” after an “injustice” has occurred, rather than “doing jus-tice” in the first place.\\n\\n \\n\\n Right on the head! You’ve hit the nail right on the head!\\n\\n justice is an action, not a reaction.\\n\\n Do not, therefore, look to Me to somehow “fix eve-rything in the end” by imposing some form of celestial justice in the “afterlife.” I tell you this: There is no “after-life,” but only life. Death does not exist. And the way you experience and create your life, as individuals and as a society, is your demonstration of what you think is just.\\n\\n \\n\\n And in this You do not see the human race as very evolved, do You? I mean, if the whole of evolution were placed on a football field, where would we be?\\n\\n \\n\\n On the 12-yard line.\\n\\n \\n\\n You’re kidding.\\n\\n \\n\\n No.\\n\\n \\n\\n We’re on the 12-yard line of evolution?\\n\\n \\n\\n Hey, you’ve moved from the 6 to the 12 in the past century alone.\\n\\n \\n\\n Any chance of ever scoring a touchdown?\\n\\n \\n\\n Of course. If you don’t fumble the ball again.\\n\\n \\n\\n Again?\\n\\n \\n\\n As I’ve said, this isn’t the first time your civilization has been at this brink. I want to repeat this, because it is vital that you hear this.\\n\\n Once before on your planet the technology you’d developed was far greater than your ability to use it re-sponsibly. You’re approaching the same point in hu-man history again.\\n\\n It’s vitally important that you understand this.\\n\\n Your present technology is threatening to outstrip your ability to use it wisely. Your society is on the verge of becoming a product of your technology, rather than your technology being a product of your society.\\n\\n When a society becomes a product of its own tech-nology, it destroys itself.\\n\\n \\n\\n Why is that? Can You explain that?\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes. The crucial issue is the balance between tech-nology and cosmology—the cosmology of all life.\\n\\n \\n\\n What do You mean by “the cosmology of all life”?\\n\\n \\n\\n Simply put, it is the way things work. The System. The Process.\\n\\n There is a “method to My madness,” you know.\\n\\n \\n\\n I was hoping there was.\\n\\n \\n\\n And the irony is that once you figure out that method, once you begin to understand more and more of how the universe works, you run a greater risk of causing a breakdown. In this way, ignorance can be bliss.\\n\\n The universe is itself a technology. It is the greatest technology. It works perfectly. On its own. But once you get in there and start messing around with universal principles and universal laws, you run the risk of break-ing those laws. And that’s a 40-yard penalty.\\n\\n \\n\\n A major setback for the home team.\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes.\\n\\n \\n\\n So, are we out of our league here?\\n\\n \\n\\n You’re getting close. Only you can determine whether you’re out of your league. You’ll determine that with your actions. For instance, you know enough about atomic energy now to blow yourselves to kingdom come.\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, but we’re not going to do that. We’re smarter than that. We’ll stop ourselves.\\n\\n \\n\\n Really? You keep proliferating your weapons of mass destruction the way you’ve been doing, and pretty soon they’ll get into the hands of somebody who will hold the world hostage to them—or destroy the world trying.\\n\\n You are giving matches to children, then hoping they won’t burn the place down, and you’ve yet to learn how to use the matches yourselves.\\n\\n The solution to all this is obvious. Take the matches away from the children. Then, throw your own matches away.\\n\\n \\n\\n But it’s too much to expect a primitive society to disarm it-self. And so, nuclear disarmament—our only lasting solu-tion—appears out of the question.\\n\\n We can’t even agree on a halt to nuclear testing. We are a race of beings singularly unable to control ourselves.\\n\\n \\n\\n And if you don’t kill yourselves with your nuclear madness, you’ll destroy your world with your environ-mental suicide. You are dismantling your home planet’s ecosystem and you continue to say that you’re not.\\n\\n As if that weren’t enough, you’re tinkering with the bio-chemistry of life itself. Cloning and genetically engineering, and not doing so with sufficient care to have this be a boon to your species, but threatening instead to make it the greatest disaster of all time. If you are not careful, you will make the nuclear and environmental threats look like child’s play.\\n\\n By developing medicines to do the work that your bodies were intended to do, you’ve created viruses so resistant to attack that they stand poised to knock out your entire species.\\n\\n \\n\\n You’re getting me a little scared here. Is all lost, then? Is the game over?\\n\\n \\n\\n No, but it is fourth-and-ten. It’s time to throw a Hail Mary, and the quarterback is looking around for receiv-ers in the clear.\\n\\n Are you clear? Are you able to receive this?\\n\\n I’m the quarterback and the last time I looked, you and I were wearing the same color jersey. Are we still on the same team?\\n\\n \\n\\n I thought there was only one team! Who is on the other team?\\n\\n \\n\\n Every thought which ignores our oneness, every idea which separates us, every action which an-nounces that we are not united. The 11other team” is not real, yet it is a part of your reality, for you have made it so.\\n\\n If you are not careful, your own technology—that which was created to serve you—will kill you.\\n\\n \\n\\n Right now I can hear some people saying, “But what can one person do?”\\n\\n \\n\\n They can start by dropping that “what can one per-son do?” stuff.\\n\\n I’ve already told you, there are hundreds of books on this subject. Stop ignoring them. Read them. Act on them. Awaken others to them. Start a revolution. Make it an evolution revolution.\\n\\n \\n\\n Isn’t that what has been going on for a long time?\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, and no. The process of evolution has been on-going forever, of course. But now that process is taking a new twist. There’s a new turn here. Now you have be-come aware that you are evolving. And not only that you are evolving, but how. Now you know the process by which evolution occurs—and through which your re-ality is created.\\n\\n Before, you were simply an observer of how your species was evolving. Now you are a conscious partici-pant.\\n\\n More people than ever before are aware of the power of the mind, their interconnectedness with all things, and their real identity as a spiritual being.\\n\\n More people than ever before are living from that space, practicing principles that invoke and produce specific results, desired outcomes, and intended expe-riences.\\n\\n This truly is an evolution revolution, for now larger and larger numbers of you are creating consciously the quality of your experience, the direct expression of Who You Really Are, and the rapid manifestation of Who You Choose to Be.\\n\\n That’s what makes this such a critical period. That’s why this is the crucial moment. For the first time in your presently recorded history (although not for the first time in human experience), you have both the technol-ogy, and the understanding of how to use it, to destroy your entire world. You can actually render yourselves extinct.\\n\\n \\n\\n These are the exact points made in a book by Barbara Marx Hubbard called Conscious Evolution.\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, that is so.\\n\\n \\n\\n It’s a document of breathtaking sweep, with wondrous visions of how we can avoid the dire outcomes of previous civilizations, and truly produce heaven on Earth. You probably inspired it!\\n\\n \\n\\n I think Barbara might say that I had a hand in it....\\n\\n \\n\\n You said before that You’ve inspired hundreds of writ-ers—many messengers. Are there other books we should be aware of?\\n\\n \\n\\n Way too many to list here. Why not conduct your own search? Then, make a list of the ones that have par-ticularly appealed to you, and share that with others.\\n\\n I have been speaking through authors, poets, and playwrights from the beginning of time. I have placed my truth in the lyrics of songs, and on the faces of paint-ings, in the shapes of sculptures, and in every beat of the human heart for ages past. And I will for ages to come.\\n\\n Each person comes to wisdom in a way that is most understandable, along a path that is most familiar. Each messenger of God derives truth from the simplest mo-ments, and shares it with equal simplicity.\\n\\n You are such a messenger. Go now and tell your people to live together in their highest truth. Share to-gether their wisdom. Experience together their love. For they can exist in peace and harmony.\\n\\n Then will yours, too, be an elevated society, such as those we have been discussing.\\n\\n \\n\\n So the main difference between our society and more highly evolved civilizations elsewhere in the universe is this idea we have of separation.\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes. The first guiding principle of advanced civiliza-tion is unity. Acknowledgment of the Oneness, and the sacredness of all life. And so what we find in all elevated societies is that under no circumstances would one be-ing willfully take the life of another of its own species against its will.\\n\\n \\n\\n No circumstances?\\n\\n \\n\\n None.\\n\\n \\n\\n Even if it were being attacked?\\n\\n \\n\\n Such a circumstance would not occur within that society or species.\\n\\n \\n\\n Perhaps not within the species, but what about from without?\\n\\n \\n\\n If a highly evolved species were attacked by an-other, it is a guarantee that the attacker would be the lesser evolved. Indeed, the attacker would be, essen-tially, a primitive being. For no evolved being would at-tack anyone.\\n\\n \\n\\n I see.\\n\\n \\n\\n The only reason a species under attack would kill another would be that the attacked being forgot Who It Really Is.\\n\\n It the first being thought it was its corporal body—its physical form—then it might kill its attacker, for it would fear the “end of its own life.”\\n\\n If, on the other hand, the first being understood full well that it was not its body, it would never end the corpo-ral existence of another—for it would never have a reason to. It would simply lay down its own corporal body and move into the experience of its noncorporal self.\\n\\n \\n\\n Like Obi-Wan Kenobi!\\n\\n \\n\\n Well, exactly. The writers of what you call your “sci-ence fiction” are often leading you to greater truth.\\n\\n I’ve got to stop here. This seems directly at variance with what was said in Book 1.\\n\\n \\n\\n What was that?\\n\\n \\n\\n Book 1 said that when someone is abusing you, it does no good to allow the abuse to continue. Book 1 said that, when acting with love, include yourself among those you love. And the book seemed to say, do whatever it takes to stop the attack on you. It even said that war was okay as a response to at-tack—that, and this is a direct quote: \" ..... despots cannot be al-lowed to flourish, but must be stopped in their despotism.”\\n\\n It also says that “choosing to be God-like does not mean you choose to be a martyr. And it certainly does not mean you choose to be a victim.”\\n\\n Now You are saying that highly evolved beings would never end the corporal life of another. How can these statements stand side by side?\\n\\n \\n\\n Read the material in Book 1 again. Closely.\\n\\n My responses there were all given, and must all be considered, within the context you created; the context of your question.\\n\\n Read your statement on the bottom of page 127 in Book 1. In that statement you allow as to how you are not now operating at a level of mastery. You say that other people’s words and actions sometimes hurt you. Given that this is so, you asked how best to respond to these experiences of hurt or damage.\\n\\n My responses are all to be taken within that context.\\n\\n I first of all said that the day will come when the words and actions of others will not hurt you. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, you will experience no damage, even when someone is “killing” you.\\n\\n This is the level of mastery that has been reached by the members of the societies I am now describing. The beings in these societies are very clear Who They Are and who they are not. It is very difficult to cause one of them to experience being “damaged,” or “hurt,” least of all by placing their corporal body in danger. They would simply exit their body and leave it for you, if you felt the need to hurt it so much.\\n\\n The next point I made in My response to you in Book 1 is that you react the way you do to the words and actions of others because you have forgotten Who You Are. But, I say there, that is all right. That is part of the growth process. It is part of evolution.\\n\\n Then I make a very important statement. All during your growth process “you must work at the level at which you are. The level of understanding, the level of willingness, the level of remembrance.”\\n\\n Everything else I have said there is to be taken within that context.\\n\\n I have even said, on page 129, “I assume for the pur-pose of this discussion that you are still ... seeking to re-alize (make ‘real’) Who You Truly Are.”\\n\\n Within the context of a society of beings who do not remember Who They Really Are, the responses I gave you in Book 1 stand as given. But you didn’t ask Me those questions here. You asked Me here to describe the highly evolved societies of the universe.\\n\\n Not only with regard to the subject at hand, but with regard to all the other topics we will cover here, it will be beneficial if you do not see these descriptions of other cultures as criticisms of your own.\\n\\n There are no judgments here. Nor will there be any condemnation if you do things differently—react differ-ently—than beings who are more evolved.\\n\\n And so what I have said here is that the highly evolved beings of the universe would never “kill” an-other sentient being in anger. First they would not ex-perience anger. Second, they would not end the corporal experience of any other being without that being’s permission. And third—to answer specifically your specific inquiry—they would never feel “at-tacked,” even from outside their own society or spe-cies, because to feel “attacked” you have to feel that someone is taking something from you—your life, your loved ones, your freedom, your property, or pos-sessions-something. And a highly evolved being would never experience that, because a highly evolved being would simply give you whatever you thought you needed so badly that you were prepared to take it by force—even if it cost the evolved being its corporal life—because the evolved being knows she can cre-ate everything all over again. She would quite natu-rally give it all away to a lesser being who did not know this.\\n\\n Highly evolved beings are therefore not martyrs, nor are they victims of anyone’s “despotism.”\\n\\n Yet it goes beyond this. Not only is the highly evolved being clear that he can create everything all over again, he is also clear that he doesn’t have to. He is clear that he needed none of it to be happy, or to sur-vive. He understands that he requires nothing exterior to himself, and that the “himself” which he is has noth-ing to do with anything physical.\\n\\n Lesser evolved beings and races are not always clear about this.\\n\\n Finally, the highly evolved being understands that she and her attackers are One. She sees the attackers as a wounded part of her Self. Her function in that circum-stance is to heal all wounds, so that the All In One can again know itself as it really is.\\n\\n Giving away all that she has would be like giving yourself an aspirin.\\n\\n \\n\\n Whoa. What a concept. What an understanding! But I need to go back to something You said earlier. You said that highly evolved beings—\\n\\n \\n\\n —Let’s abbreviate that as “HEBs” from here on. It’s a long name to have to use over and over again.\\n\\n \\n\\n Good. Well, You said that “HEBs” would never end the corporal experience of another being without the being’s per-mission.\\n\\n \\n\\n That’s right.\\n\\n \\n\\n But why would one being give another being permission to end its physical life?\\n\\n \\n\\n There could be any number of reasons. It might of-fer itself as food, for instance. Or to serve some other necessity—like stopping a war.\\n\\n \\n\\n This must be why, even in our own cultures, there are those who would not kill any animal for food or hides without asking the spirit of that being for permission.\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes. This is the way of your Native Americans, who would not even pick a flower, an herb, or a plant with-out having this communication. All of your indigenous cultures do the same. Interestingly, those are the tribes and cultures that you call “primitive.”\\n\\n \\n\\n Oh, man, are You telling me I can’t even pick a radish with-out asking if it’s okay?\\n\\n \\n\\n You can do anything you choose to do. You asked Me what “HEBs” would do.\\n\\n \\n\\n So Native Americans are highly evolved beings?\\n\\n \\n\\n As with all races and species, some are, and some are not. It is an individual thing. As a culture, though, they have reached a very high level. The cultural myths which inform much of their experience are very ele-vated. But, you have forced them to mix their cultural myths with your own.\\n\\n \\n\\n Wait a minute! What are You saying? The Red Man was a savage! That’s why we had to kill them by the thousands, and put the rest in land-prisons we call reservations! Why, even now we take their sacred sites and put golf courses on them. We have to. Otherwise they might honor their sacred sites, and re-member their cultural stories, and perform their sacred rituals, and we can’t have that.\\n\\n \\n\\n I get the picture.\\n\\n \\n\\n No, really. Why, if we hadn’t taken over and tried to erase their culture, they might have impacted ours! Then how would we have wound up?\\n\\n We’d be respecting the land and the air, refusing to poison our rivers, and then where would our industry be!\\n\\n The whole population would probably still be walking around naked, with no shame, bathing in the river, living off the land, instead of crowding into high-rises and condomini-ums and bungalows and going to work in the asphalt jungle.\\n\\n Why, we’d probably still be listening to ancient wisdom teachings around a campfire instead of watching TV! We would have made no progress at all.\\n\\n \\n\\n Well, fortunately, you know what’s good for you.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/639.html","bookId":36,"book":{"id":36,"title":"与神对话 Conversations With God","description":"简介： Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Religious","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
