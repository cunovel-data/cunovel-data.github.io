{"id":1030,"no":56,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 16","content":"I am filled with awe and reverence at the reading of those words. Thank You for being here with me in this way. Thank You for being here with all of us. You are welcome. Thank you for being here for Me. I have just a few remaining questions, some having to do with those “evolved beings,” and then I will allow myself to fin-ish this dialogue. My Beloved, you will never finish this dialogue, nor will you ever have to. Your conversation with God will go on forever. And, now that you are actively engaged in it, that conversation will soon lead to friendship. All good conversations eventually lead to friendship, and soon your conversation with Cod will produce a Friend-ship with God. I feel that. I feel that we’ve actually become friends. And, as happens in all relationships, that friendship, if it is nurtured, kindled, and allowed to grow, will pro-duce, at last, a sense of communion. You will feel and experience your Self as being in Communion with God. This will be a Holy Communion, for then We will speak as One. And so this dialogue will continue? Yes, always. And I won’t have to say goodbye at the end of this book? You never have to say goodbye. You only have to say hello. You’re marvelous, do You know that? You’re simply marvelous. And so are you, My son. And so are you. As are all My children, everywhere. Do You have children “everywhere”? Of course. No, I mean literally, everywhere. Is there life on other plan-ets? Are Your children elsewhere in the universe? Again, of course. Are these civilizations more advanced? Some of them, yes. In what way? In every way. Technologically. Politically. Socially. Spiritually. Physically. And psychologically. For instance, your penchant for, your insistence upon, comparisons, and your constant need to charac-terize something as “better” or “worse,” “higher” or “lower,” “good” or “bad” demonstrates how far into duality you have fallen; how deeply into separatism you have submerged. In more advanced civilizations You do not observe these characteristics? And what do You mean by duality? The level of a society’s advancement is reflected, inevitably, in the degree of its duality thinking. Social evolution is demonstrated by movement towards unity, not separatism. Why? Why is unity such a yardstick? Because unity is the truth. Separatism is the illusion. As long as a society sees itself as separate—a series or collection of separate units—it lives in the illusion. All of life on your planet is built on separatism; based in duality. You imagine yourselves to be separate families or clans, gathered in separate neighborhoods or states, collected in separate nations or countries, comprising a separate world, or planet. You imagine your world to be the only inhabited world in the universe. You imagine your nation to be the finest nation on earth. You imagine your state to be the best state in the nation, and your family the most wonderful in the state. Finally, you think that you are better than anyone else in your family. Oh, you claim you don’t think any of this, but you act as if you do. Your true thoughts are reflected every day in your social decisions, your political conclusions, your relig-ious determinations, your economic choices, and your individual selections of everything from friends to belief systems to your very relationship with God. That is, Me. You feel so separate from Me that you imagine I won’t even talk to you. And so you are required to deny the veracity of your own experience. You experience that you and I are One, but you refuse to believe it. Thus you are separate not only from each other, but from your own truth. How can a person be separate from his or her own truth? By ignoring it. By seeing it and denying it. Or by changing it, twisting it, contorting it to fit a precon-ceived notion you have about what must be so. Take the question with which you started off here. You asked, is there life on other planets? I answered, “Of course.” I said, “Of course” because the evidence is so obvious. It is so obvious that I’m surprised you even asked the question. Yet this is how a person can be “separate from his own truth”: by looking truth in the eye so squarely he can’t miss it—and then denying what he sees. Denial is the mechanism here. And nowhere is de-nial more insidious than in self-denial. You’ve spent a lifetime denying Who and What You Really Are. It would be sad enough if you limited your denials to less personal things, such as your depletion of the ozone layer, your rape of old-growth forests, your horrible treatment of your young. But you are not content with denying all that you see around you. You won’t rest un-til you deny all that you see within you as well. You see goodness and compassion within you, but you deny it. You see wisdom within you, but you deny it. You see infinite possibility within you, but you deny it. And you see and experience God within you, yet you deny it. You deny that I am within you—that I am you—and in this you deny Me My rightful and obvious place. I have not, and do not, deny You. You admit that You are God? Well, I wouldn’t say that... Exactly. And I tell you this: “Before the cock crows, you will deny Me three times.” By your very thoughts will you deny Me. By your very words will you deny Me. By your very actions will you deny Me. You know in your heart that I am with you, in you; that We are One. Yet you deny Me. Oh, some of you say I exist all right. But away from you. Way out there somewhere. And the further away you imagine Me to be, the further away you step from your own truth. As with so much else in life—from depletion of your planet’s natural resources to the abuse of children in so many of your homes—you see it, but you don’t believe it. But why? Why? Why do we see, and yet not believe? Because you are so caught up in the illusion, you are so deep in the illusion, that you cannot see past it. In-deed, you must not for the illusion to continue. This is the Divine Dichotomy. You must deny Me if you are to continue seeking to become Me. And that is what you are wanting to do. Yet you cannot become what you already are. So denial is important. It is a useful tool. Until it is not anymore. The master knows that denial is for those who are choosing to have the illusion continue. Acceptance is for those who choose now for the illusion to end. Acceptance, proclamation, demonstration. Those are the three steps to God. Acceptance of Who and What You Really Are. Proclamation of it for all the world to hear. And demonstration in every way. Self-proclamation is always followed by demonstra-tion. You will demonstrate your Self to be God—even as you now demonstrate what you think of your Self. Your whole life is a demonstration of that. Yet with this demonstration will come your greatest challenge. For the moment you stop denying your Self, others will deny you. The moment you proclaim your Oneness with God, others will proclaim your partnership with Satan. The moment you speak the highest truth, others will say you speak the lowest blasphemy. And, as happens with all masters who gently dem-onstrate their mastery, you will be both worshipped and reviled, elevated and denigrated, honored and cru-cified. Because while for you the cycle will be over, those who are still living in the illusion will not know what to make of you. Yet what will happen to me? I don’t understand. I’m con-fused. I thought You’ve said, over and over again, that the illu-sion must go on, that the “game” must continue, in order for there to be any “game” at all? Yes, I have said that. And it does. The game does go on. Because one or two of you end the cycle of illusion, that does not end the game—not for you, and not for the other players. The game is not ended until All-in-All becomes One again. Even then it is not ended. For in the moment of divine reunion, All with All, will the bliss be so magnifi-cent, so intense, that I-We-You will literally burst wide open with gladness, exploding with joy—and the cycle will begin all over again. It will never end, My child. The game will never end. For the game is life itself, and life is Who We Are. But what happens to the individual element, or “Part of All,” as You call it, which rises to mastery, which achieves all-knowing? That master knows that only his part of the cycle is complete. She knows that only her experience of the il-lusion has ended. Now the master laughs, because the master sees the master plan. The master sees that even with her comple-tion of the cycle, the game goes on; the experience con-tinues. The master then also sees the role he may now play in the experience. The master’s role is to lead others to mastery. And so the master continues to play, but in a new way, and with new tools. For seeing the illusion al-lows the master to step outside of it. This the master will do from time to time when it suits his purpose and pleasure. Thus she proclaims and demonstrates her mastery, and he is called God/Goddess by others. When all in your race are led to mastery and achieve it, then your race as a whole (for your race is a whole) will move easily through time and space (you will have mastered the laws of physics as you understood them) and you will seek to assist those belonging to other races and other civilizations in coming to mastery as well. Even as those of other races and other civilizations are do-ing so now, with us? Exactly. Precisely. And only when all the races of all the universe have achieved mastery— —or, as I would put it, only when All of Me has known the Oneness— —will this part of the cycle end. You have put it wisely. For the cycle itself will never end. Because the very ending of this part of the cycle is the cycle itself! Bravo! Magnifico! You have understood! So yes, there is life on other planets. And yes, much of it is more advanced than your own. In what way? You never really did answer that question. Yes I did. I said, in every way. Technologically. Po-litically. Socially. Spiritually. Physically. Psychologically. Yes, but give me some examples. Those are statements so broad that they are meaningless to me. You know, I love your truth. It’s not everyone who would look God in the eye and announce that what He is saying is meaningless. So? What are you going to do about it? Exactly. You have exactly the right attitude. Be-cause, of course, you’re right. You can challenge Me, confront Me, and call Me into question as much as you want, and I’m not going to do a damned thing. I may, however, do a blessed thing, such as I’m do-ing here, with this dialogue. Is this not a blessed event? Yes, this is. And many people have been helped by this. Millions of people have been, are being, touched by this. I know that. It’s all part of the “master plan.” The plan for how you become masters. You knew from the beginning that this trilogy would be a massive success, didn’t You? Of course I did. Who do you suppose has made it such a success? Who do you imagine has caused those people who are reading this to have found their way to it? I tell you this: I know every person who will come to this material. And I know the reason each has been brought. And so do they. Now the only question is, will they deny Me again? Does it matter to You? Not in the least. All My children will one day come back to Me. It is not a question of whether, but of when. And so, it may matter to them. Therefore, let those who have ears to hear, listen. Yes, well—we were talking about life on other planets, and You were about to give me some examples of how it is so much more advanced than life on Earth. Technologically, most other civilizations are far ahead of you. There are those which are behind you, so to speak, but not many. Most are far ahead of you. In what way? Give me an example. Okay, the weather. You don’t seem able to control it. (You can’t even accurately predict it!) You are, there-fore, subject to its whims. Most worlds are not. The be-ings on most planets can control the local temperature, for example. They can? I thought temperature on a planet was a product of its distance from its sun, its atmosphere, etc. Those things establish the parameters. Within those parameters much can be done. How so? In what way? By controlling the environment. By creating, or fail-ing to create, certain conditions in the atmosphere. You see, it is not only a matter of where you are in relationship to a sun, but what you place between your-self and that sun. You have placed the most dangerous things in your atmosphere—and taken out some of the most impor-tant. Yet you are in denial about this. That is, most of you will not admit it. Even when the finest minds among you prove beyond doubt the damage you are doing, you will not acknowledge it. You call the finest minds among you crazed, and say that you know better. Or you say that these wise people only have an ax to grind, a point of view to validate, and their own inter-ests to protect. Yet it is you who are grinding an ax. It is you who are seeking to validate a point of view. And it is you who are protecting your special interests. And your chief interest is yourself. Every evidence, no matter how scientific, no matter how demonstrable or compelling, will be denied if it violates your self-interest. That’s a rather harsh statement, and I’m not sure it’s true. Really? Now you’re calling God a liar? Well, I wouldn’t put it that way, exactly... Do you know how long it has taken your nations to agree to simply stop poisoning the atmosphere with fluorocarbons? Yes... Well.. Well, nothing. Why do you suppose it took so long? Never mind. I’ll tell you. It took so long because to stop the poisoning would cost many major companies a great deal of money. It took so long because it would cost many individual people their conveniences. It took so long because for years many people and nations chose to deny—needed to deny—the evidence in order to protect their interest in the status quo; in keeping things the way they are. Only when the rate of skin cancers increased alarm-ingly, only when the temperatures began rising and the glaciers and snows began melting, and the oceans got warmer and the lakes and rivers began flooding, did more of you begin paying attention. Only when your own self-interest demanded it, did you see the truth that your finest minds had been plac-ing before you for years. What’s wrong with self-interest? I thought You said in Book I that self-interest was the place to start. I did, and it is. Yet in other cultures and other socie-ties on different planets, the definition of “self-interest” is much larger than it is on your world. It is very clear to enlightened creatures that what hurts one hurts the many, and that what benefits the few must benefit the many, or, ultimately, it benefits no one. On your planet it is just the opposite. What hurts one is ignored by the many, and what benefits the few is denied the many. This is because your definition of self-interest is very narrow, barely reaching past the individual being to his loved ones—and to those only when they do his bidding. Yes, I said in Book 1 that in all relationships, do what is in the best interests of the Self. But I also said that when you see what is in your highest self-interest, you will see that it is that which is also in the highest interest of the other—for you and the other are One. You and all others are One—and this is a level of knowingness that you have not attained. You’re asking about advanced technologies, and I tell you this: You cannot have advanced technologies in any beneficial way without advanced thinking. Advanced technology without advanced thought creates not advancement, but demise. You have already experienced that on your planet, and you are very nearly about to experience it again. What do You mean? What are You talking about? lam saying that once before on your planet you had reached the heights—beyond the heights, really—to which you now are slowly climbing. You had a civiliza-tion on Earth more advanced than the one now exist-ing. And it destroyed itself. Not only did it destroy itself, it nearly destroyed eve-rything else as well. It did this because it did not know how to deal with the very technologies it had developed. Its technologi-cal evolution was so far ahead of its spiritual evolution that it wound up making technology its God. The peo-ple worshipped technology, and all that it could create and bring. And so they got all that their unbridled tech-nology brought—which was unbridled disaster. They literally brought their world to an end. This all happened here, on this Earth? Yes. Are You talking about the Lost City of Atlantis? Some of you have called it that. And Lemuria? The land of Mu? That is also part of your mythology. So then it is true! We did get to that place before! Oh, beyond it, My friend. Way beyond it. And we did destroy ourselves! Why are you surprised? You’re doing the same thing now. I know we are. Will You tell us how we can stop? There are many other books devoted to this subject. Most people ignore them. Give us one title, I promise we won’t ignore it. Read The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight. By a man named Thom Hartmann. Yes! I love that book! Good. This messenger is inspired. Bring this book to the attention of the world. I will. I will. It says everything that I would say here, in answer to your last question. There is no need for Me to rewrite that book through you. It contains a summary of many of the ways in which your Earth home is being damaged, and ways that you can stop the ruination. So far what the human race has been doing on this planet is not very smart. In fact, throughout this dialogue You have de-scribed our species as “primitive.” Ever since You first made that remark I’ve been wondering what it must be like living in a non-primitive culture. You say there are many such societies or cultures in the universe. Yes. How many? A great many. Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands. Thousands? There are thousands of advanced civilizations? Yes. And there are other cultures more primitive than yours. What else marks a society as either “primitive” or “ad-vanced”? The degree to which it implements its own highest understandings. This is different from what you believe. You believe that a society should be called primitive or advanced based on how high its understandings are. But what good are the highest understandings if you do not implement them? The answer is, they are no good at all. Indeed, they are dangerous. It is the mark of a primitive society to call regression progress. Your society has moved backward, not for-ward. Much of your world demonstrated more com-passion seventy years ago than it does today. Some people are going to have a hard time hearing this. You say You are a nonjudgmental God, yet some people may feel judged and made wrong all over the place here. We’ve been over this before. If you say you want to go to Seattle and you’re actually driving to San Jose, is the person of whom you’re asking directions being judgmental if you’re told you’re heading in a direction that won’t get you where you say you want to go? Calling us “primitive” is not simply giving us directions. The word primitive is pejorative. Really? And yet you say you so admire “primitive” art. And certain music is often savored, for its “primi-tive” qualities—to say nothing of certain women. You’re using word play now to change things around. Not at all. I’m merely showing you that “primitive” is not necessarily pejorative. It is your judgment that makes it so. “Primitive” is merely descriptive. It simply says what is true: A certain thing is in the very early stages of devel-opment. It says nothing more than that. It says nothing about “right” or “wrong.” You add those meanings. I have not “made you wrong” here. I have merely described your culture as primitive. That would only “sounds” wrong to you if you have a judgment about being primitive. I have no such judgment. Understand this: An assessment is not a judgment. It is merely an observation of What Is. I want you to know that I love you. I have no judg-ments about you. I look at you and see only beauty and wonder. Like that primitive art. Precisely. I hear your melody and I feel only excite-ment. As with primitive music. You are understanding now. I feel the energy of your race as you would the energy of a man or woman of “primitive sensuality.” And, like you, I am aroused. Now that is what is true about you and Me. You do not disgust Me, you do not disturb Me, you do not even disappoint Me. You arouse Me! I am aroused to new possibilities, to new experi-ences yet to come. In you I am awakened to new ad-ventures, and to the excitement of movement to new levels of magnificence. Far from disappointing Me, you thrill Me! I am thrilled at the wonder of you. You think you are at the pinnacle of human development, and I tell you, you are just beginning. You have only just begun to experience your splendor! Your grandest ideas are as yet unexpressed, and your grandest vision unlived. But wait! Look! Notice! The days of your blossom-ing are at hand. The stalk has grown strong, and the pet-als are soon to open. And I tell you this: The beauty and the fragrance of your flowering shall fill the land, and you shall yet have your place in the Garden of the Gods.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/638.html","bookId":36,"book":{"id":36,"title":"与神对话 Conversations With God","description":"简介： Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Religious","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
