{"id":992,"no":18,"title":"Part 2 Introduction","content":"This is an extraordinary document.\n It is a message from God, and in it God suggests a social, sexual, educational, political, economic and theological revo-lution on this planet the likes of which we have never seen, and seldom imagined.\n That suggestion is made within the context of our own stated desires as the planet’s inhabitants. We have said that we choose to create a better life for all, to elevate our consciousness, to seek a newer world. God will not condemn us no matter what we choose, but if we choose this, He is willing to show us the way. She will not force us, however, to take Her suggestions. Not now, not ever.\n I find the words in this book at once captivating, disturbing, challenging, uplifting. They are captivating in that they catch my breath with the scope and sweep of their reach. They are disturbing in that they show me to myself—and the human race to me—in a way which is very unsettling. They are challenging in that they put the dare to me as no one and nothing ever has before. The dare to be better, the dare to be bigger than I have been, the dare to be the Source of a world in which anger, petty jealousy, sexual dysfunction, economic inequity, educational tomfoolery, social inequality and political secrecy, chicaneries and power plays are never again part of the human experience. They are uplifting in that they hold out the hope that all this is possible.\n Can we really build such a world? God says yes, and that all it takes is for us to really choose to do it.\n This book is an actual dialogue with God. It is the second in a series of three books capturing a conversation with Deity which has lasted well over five years—and continues to this very day.\n You may not believe that this material has actually come from God, and I have no need for you to. What is important to me is only whether the material itself has any value, brings any insight, produces any awakening, sparks any renewed desire, or promotes any fruitful change in our day-to-day life on Earth. God knows, something has to change. We can’t keep going on as we have been.\n The Conversations with God trilogy began when Book 1 of this series was released in May of 1995. That book dealt with mainly personal concerns, and changed my life. It changed a lot of lives. Within weeks it became an astonishingly fast seller, with distribution reaching amazing levels. By the end of its first year it was selling 12,000 copies a month, and rising. Of course, the “author” of the book was hardly unknown. And that is what has made the document so intriguing, and so powerful.\n I have been deeply grateful to be part of this process, the process by which some great truths are being remembered once again by thousands of people. I am personally pleased and very happy that so many have found value in the work.\n I want you to know that at first I was downright scared. It occurred to me that others might think I was crazy, suffering delusions of grandeur. Or that, if they did believe the material to have been inspired by God, they would then actually follow the advice. And why was I afraid of this? Simple. I knew that everything I had written could be wrong.\n Then the letters began arriving. Letters from people all over the world. And then I knew. Deep inside, I knew. This was right. This was exactly what the world needed to hear, at exactly the right time!\n (Of course, there is no “right” and “wrong,” except within the relative experience of our existence. So, what I know myself to mean is that the book is “right on,” given who and what we say on this planet we want to be.)\n Now along comes Book 2, and I notice I’ve gone into fear all over again. This book deals with larger aspects of our individual lives, as well as geophysical and geopolitical consid-erations of worldwide implication. As such, this volume will contain, I suspect, much more with which the average reader may disagree. And so, I’m afraid. I’m afraid you won’t like what you read here. I’m afraid that you’ll make me “wrong” for some of it. I’m afraid that I will stir up a hornet’s nest, kick up a storm, make waves. And, once more, I’m afraid that everything here could be wrong.\n Certainly I should know better than to have these fears. After all, hadn’t I read my own first book? Well, there you have it. My humanness again. You see, it is not my goal in making these transcriptions public to shake people up. I wish only to honestly and forthrightly pass on to you what God has communicated to me, in answer to my questions. I promised God I would do that—make public these conversations—and I can’t break that promise.\n You can’t break your promise, either. Obviously you have made a promise to allow all of your thoughts, ideas and beliefs to be continually challenged. Clearly, you have made a deep com-mitment to continually grow. Only a person with such a commit-ment would pick up a book like this.\n So, it seems, we are in this together. And there’s nothing to fear. We are what we are, and we do what we do as a result of that, and all we have to do is stay true to that and there’s nothing to fear. What I now see that I guess I’ve known all along is that we are messengers, you and I. If we weren’t, I wouldn’t be writing this, and you certainly wouldn’t be reading it. We’re messengers, and we have work to do. First, we have to make sure we clearly understand the message we’ve been given in the CWG books. Second, we have to integrate that message into our lives so that it becomes functional. And third, we have to carry that message to others, bringing its truth to all those whose lives we touch, by the simple and exquisite device of our example.\n I’m glad you’ve chosen to take this journey with me. It’s much easier, and much more fun, with you than without you. Let’s walk together now through these pages. It could be a little uncomfortable now and then. Not like Book 1. Book I was God’s embrace; a big, warm hug around the shoulders. Book 2 is God’s equally loving, but more gently jarring shake of those shoulders. A wake-up call. A challenge to move to the next level.\n There always is a next level, you know. Your soul— which came here for the richest experience, not the poorest; the most, not the least—would like you not to rest. And while the choice is always yours, your soul would have it that you never become complacent or self satisfied, and certainly never sink into apathy. For there’s too much to change in your world, too much left of yourself for you to create. Always there’s a new mountain to climb, a new frontier to explore, a new fear to conquer. Always there’s a grander place, a larger concept, a greater vision.\n So this book may be a bit more uncomfortable than Book 1. Stay with the discomfort if and when you feel it. Hold onto the boat if it begins to rock. Then live within a new paradigm. Better yet, through the wonder and the example of your own life lived, help to create one.\n \n \n Neale Donald Walsch\n March 1997\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/600.html","bookId":36,"book":{"id":36,"title":"与神对话 Conversations With God","description":"简介： Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Religious","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
