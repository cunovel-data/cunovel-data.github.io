{"id":1012,"no":38,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 20","content":"Why do people doubt You? Because they doubt themselves. Why do they doubt themselves? Because they have been told to; taught to. By whom? People who claimed to be representing Me. I don’t get it. Why? Because it was a way, is the only way, to control people. You must doubt yourself, you see, or you would claim all your power. That would not do. That would not do at all. Not for the people who currently hold the power. They are holding the power which is yours—and they know it. And the only way to hold on to it is to stave off the world’s movement toward seeing, and then solving, the two biggest problems in the human experience. Which are? Well, I’ve discussed them over and over again in this book. To summarize, then . . . Most, if not all, of the world’s problems and con-flicts, and of your problems and conflicts as individuals, would be solved and resolved if you would, as a society: 1. Abandon the concept of Separation. 2. Adopt the concept of Visibility. Never see yourself again as separate from one an-other, and never see yourself as separate from Me. Never tell anything but the whole truth to anyone, and never again accept anything less than your grandest truth about Me. The first choice will produce the second, for when you see and understand that you are One with Every-one, you can not tell an untruth or withhold important data or be anything but totally visible with all others because you will be clear that it is in your own best interests to do so. But this paradigm shift will take great wisdom, great courage, and massive determination. For Fear will strike at the heart of these concepts and call them false. Fear will eat at the core of these magnificent truths and make them appear hollow. Fear will distort, disdain, destroy. And so Fear will be your greatest enemy. Yet you will not have, cannot produce, the society for which you have always yearned and of which you have always dreamed unless and until you see with wisdom and clarity the ultimate truth: that what you do to others, you do to yourself; what you fail to do for others, you fail to do for yourself; that the pain of others is your pain, and the joy of others your joy, and that when you disclaim any part of it, you disclaim a part of yourself. Now is the time to reclaim yourself. Now is the time to see yourself again as Who You Really Are, and thus render yourself visible again. For when you and your true relationship with God become visible, then We are indivisible. And nothing will ever divide Us again. And although you will live again in the illusion of separation, using it as a tool to create your Self anew, you will henceforth move through your incarnations with enlightenment, seeing the illusion for what it is, using it playfully and joyfully to experience any aspect of Who We Are which it pleases you to experience, yet nevermore accepting it as reality. You will nevermore have to use the device of forgetfulness in order to recreate your Self anew, but will use Separation knowingly, simply choosing to manifest as That Which Is Separate for a particular reason and a particular purpose. And when you are thus totally enlightened—that is, once more filled with the light—you may even choose, as your particular reason for returning to physical life, the re-minding of others. You may select to return to this physical life not to create and experience any new aspect of your Self, but to bring the light of truth to this place of illusion, that others may see. Then will you be a “bringer of the light.” Then will you be part of The Awakening. There are others who have already done this. They have come here to help us to know Who We Are. Yes. They are enlightened souls, souls which have evolved. They no longer seek the next higher experi-ence of themselves. They have already had the highest experience. They desire now only to bring news of that experience to you. They bring you the “good news.” They will show you the way, and the life, of God. They will say “1 am the way and the life. Follow me.” Then they will model for you what it is like to live in the everlasting glory of conscious union with God—which is called God Consciousness. We are always united, you and I. We cannot not be. It is simply impossible. Yet you live now in the uncon-scious experience of that unification. It is also possible to live in the physical body in conscious union with All That Is; in conscious awareness of ultimate truth; in conscious expression of Who You Really Are. When you do this, you serve as a model for all others, others who are living in forgetfulness. You become a living re-min-der. And in this you save others from becoming perma-nently lost in their forgetfulness. That is hell, to become lost permanently in forget-fulness. Yet I will not allow it. I will not allow a single sheep to be lost, but will send ... a shepherd. Indeed, many shepherds will I send, and you may choose to be one of them. And when souls are awak-ened by you from their slumber, re-minded once again of Who They Are, all the angels in heaven rejoice for these souls. For once they were lost, and now they are found. There are people, holy beings, like this right now on our planet, is that not right? Not just in the past, but right now? Yes. Always there have been. Always there will be. I will not leave you without teachers; I will not abandon the flock, but always send after it My shepherds. And there are many on your planet right now, and in other parts of the universe as well. And in some parts of the universe these beings live together in constant com-munion and in constant expression of the highest truth. These are the enlightened societies of which I have spoken. They exist, they are real, and they have sent you their emissaries. You mean the Buddha, Krishna, Jesus were spacemen? You said that, I didn’t. Is it true? Is this the first time you ever heard that thought? No, but is it true? Do you believe these masters existed somewhere before they came to Earth and returned to that place after their so-called death? Yes, I do. And where do you suppose that place is? I’d always thought it was what we call “heaven.” I thought they came from heaven. And where do you suppose this heaven is? I don’t know. In another realm, I guess. Another world? Yes... Oh, I see. But I would have called it the spirit world, not another world as we know it, not another planet. It is the spirit world. Yet what makes you think those spirits—those Holy Spirits—cannot, or would not choose to, live elsewhere in the universe, just as they did when they came to your world? I suppose I just never thought of it that way. It has not been part of my ideas about all of this. “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” Your wonderful metaphysician, William Shake-speare, wrote that. Then Jesus was a spaceman! I didn’t say that. Well, was he or wasn’t he? Patience, My child. You jump ahead too much. There is more. So much more. We have another whole book to write. You mean I have to wait for Book 3? I told you, I promised you from the beginning. There will be three books, I said. The first would deal with individual life truths and challenges. The second would discuss truths of life as a family on this planet. And the third, I said, would cover the largest truths, having to do with the eternal questions. In this will be revealed the secrets of the universe. Unless they are not. Oh, man. I don’t know how much more of this I can take. I mean, I’m really tired of “living in the contradiction,” as You always put it. I want what’s so to be so. Then so shall it be. Unless it’s not. That’s it! That’s it! You’ve GOT it! Now you under-stand the Divine Dichotomy. Now you see the whole picture. Now you comprehend the plan. Everything—everything—that ever was, is now, and ever will be exists right now. And so, all that is . . . IS. Yet all that IS is constantly changing, for life is an ongoing process of creation. Therefore, in a very real sense, That Which IS... IS NOT. This ISNESS is NEVER THE SAME. Which means that the ISNESS is NOT. Well, excuse me Charlie Brown, but good grief How can anything then mean anything? It doesn’t. But you are jumping ahead again! All of this in good time, My son. All of this in good time. These and other larger mysteries will all be under-stood after reading Book 3. Unless . . . all together now... UNLESS THEY ARE NOT. Precisely. Okay, okay. . . fair enough. But between now and then—or, for that matter, for the people who may never get to read these books—what avenues can be used right here, right now, to get back to wisdom, to get back to clarity, to get back to God? Do we need to return to religion? Is that the missing link? Return to spirituality. Forget about religion. That statement is going to anger a lot of people. People wilt react to this entire book with anger. unless they do not. Why do You say, forget religion? Because it is not good for you. Understand that in order for organized religion to succeed, it has to make people believe they need it. In order for people to put faith in something else, they must first lose faith in themselves. So the first task of organized religion is to make you lose faith in yourself. The second task is to make you see that it has the answers you do not. And the third and most important task is to make you accept its answers without question. If you question, you start to think! If you think, you start to go back to that Source Within. Religion can’t have you do that, because you’re liable to come up with an answer different from what it has contrived. So religion must make you doubt your Self; must make you doubt your own ability to think straight. The problem for religion is that very often this backfires—for if you cannot accept without doubt your own thoughts, how can you not doubt the new ideas about God which religion has given you? Pretty soon, you even doubt My existence—which, ironically, you never doubted before. When you were living by your intuitive knowing, you may not have had Me all figured out, but you definitely knew I was there! It is religion which has created agnostics. Any clear thinker who looks at what religion has done must assume religion has no God! For it is religion which has filled the hearts of men with fear of Cod, where once man loved That Which Is in all its splendor. It is religion which has ordered men to bow down before God, where once man rose up in joyful out-reach. It is religion which has burdened man with worries about God’s wrath, where once man sought Cod to lighten his burden! It is religion which told man to be ashamed of his body and its most natural functions, where once man celebrated those functions as the greatest gifts of life! It is religion which taught you that you must have an intermediary in order to reach Cod, where once you thought yourself to be reaching Cod by the simple living of your life in goodness and in truth. And it is religion which commanded humans to adore God, where once humans adored God because it was impossible not to! Everywhere religion has gone it has created dis-unity—which is the opposite of God. Religion has separated man from Cod, man from man, man from woman—some religions actually telling man that he is above woman, even as it claims Cod is above man—thus setting the stage for the greatest travesties ever foisted upon half the human race. I tell you this: God is not above man, and man is not above woman—that is not the “natural order of things”—but it is the way everyone who had power (namely, men) wished it was when they formed their male-worship religions, systematically editing out half the material from their final version of the “holy scrip-tures” and twisting the rest to fit the mold of their male model of the world. It is religion which insists to this very day that women are somehow less, somehow second-class spiritual citi-zens, somehow not “suited” to teach the Word of Cod, preach the Word of God, or minister to the people. Like children, you are still arguing over which gen-der is ordained by Me to be My priests! I tell you this: You are all priests. Every single one of you. There is no one person or class of people more “suited” to do My work than any other. But so many of your men are just like your nations. Power hungry. They do not like to share power, merely exercise it. And they have constructed the same kind of God. A power hungry God. A God who does not like to share power but merely exercise it. Yet I tell you this: God’s greatest gift is the sharing of God’s power. I would have you be like Me. But we cannot be like You! That would be blasphemy. The blasphemy is that you have been taught such things. I tell you this: You have been made in the Image and Likeness of God—it is that destiny you came to fulfill. You did not come here to strive and to struggle and to never “get there.” Nor did I send you on a mission impossible to complete. Believe in the goodness of God, and believe in the goodness of God’s creation—namely, your holy Selves. You said something earlier in this book which intrigued me. I’d like to go back as we come to the end of this volume. You said: “Absolute Power demands absolutely nothing.” Is this the nature of God? You have now understood. I have said, “God is everything, and Cod becomes everything. There is nothing which God is not, and all that Cod is experiencing of Itself, God is experiencing in, as, and through you.” In My purest form, I am the Absolute. I am Absolutely Everything, and therefore, I need, want, and demand absolutely nothing. From this absolutely pure form, I am as you make Me. It is as if you were finally to see Cod and say, “Well, what do you make of that?” Yet, no matter what you make of Me, I cannot forget, and will always return to, My Purest Form. All the rest is a fiction. It is something you are making up. There are those who would make Me a jealous God; but who could be jealous when one has, and is, Every-thing? There are those who would make Me a wrathful God; but what could cause Me to be angry when I can not be hurt or damaged in any way? There are those who would make Me a vengeful God; but on whom would I take vengeance, since all that exists is Me? And why would I punish Myself for simply creating? Or, if you must think of us as separate, why would I create you, give you the power to create, give you the freedom of choice to create what you wish to experi-ence, then punish you forever for making the “wrong” choice? I tell you this: I would not do such a thing—and in that truth lies your freedom from the tyranny of God. In truth, there is no tyranny—except in your imagi-nation. You may come home whenever you wish. We can be together again whenever you want. The ecstasy of your union with Me is yours to know again. At the drop of a hat. At the feel of the wind on your face. At the sound of a cricket under diamond skies on a summer night. At the first sight of a rainbow and the first cry of a newborn babe. At the last ray of a spectacular sunset and the last breath in a spectacular life. I am with you always, even unto the end of time. Your union with Me is complete—it always was, always is, and always will be. You and I are One—both now and even forever-more. Go now, and make of your life a statement of this truth. Cause your days and nights to be reflections of the highest idea within you. Allow your moments of Now to be filled with the spectacular ecstasy of God made manifest through you. Do it through the expression of your Love, eternal and unconditional, for all those whose lives you touch. Be a light unto the darkness, and curse it not. Be a bringer of the light. You are that. So be it.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/620.html","bookId":36,"book":{"id":36,"title":"与神对话 Conversations With God","description":"简介： Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Religious","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
