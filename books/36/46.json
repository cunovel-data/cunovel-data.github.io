{"id":1020,"no":46,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 6","content":"I’d like to change the subject now, if I could, and talk about Earth changes. But before I do, I’d like to just make an observa-tion. It seems as though there are a lot of things being said here more than once. I sometimes feel like I’m hearing the same things, over and over again. That’s good! Because you are! As I said earlier, this is by design. This message is like a spring. When it is coiled, it circles back onto itself. One circle covers the other, and it seems to be, literally, “going around in circles.” Only when the spring is uncoiled will you see that it stretches out in a spiral, farther than you could have ever imag-ined. Yes, you are right. Much of what is being said has been said a number of times, in different ways. Some-times in the same way. The observation is correct. When you are finished with this message, you should be able to repeat its essential points virtually ver-batim. The day may come when you may wish to. Okay, fair enough. Now, moving forward, a bunch of peo-ple seem to think I have a “direct line to God,” and they want to know, is our planet doomed? I know I asked this before, but now I’d really like a direct answer. Will the Earth changes oc-cur, as so many are predicting? And if not, what are all those psychics seeing? A made-up vision? Should we be praying? Changing? Is there anything we can do? Or is it all, sadly, hope-less? I will be happy to address those questions, but we will not be “moving forward.” We won’t? No, because the answers have already been given you, in My several previous explanations of time. You mean the part about “everything that’s ever going to happen has already happened.” Yes. But what IS the “everything that has already happened?” How did it happen? What happened? All of it happened. All of it has already happened. Every possibility exists as fact, as completed events. How can that be? I still don’t understand how that can be. I am going to put this in terms to which you can better relate. See if this helps. Have you ever watched children use a CD-ROM to play a computerized video game? Yes. Have you ever asked yourself how the computer knows how to respond to every move the child makes with the joystick? Yes, actually, I have wondered that. It’s all on the disc. The computer knows how to re-spond to every move the child makes because every possible move has already been placed on the disc, along with its appropriate response. That’s spooky. Almost surreal. What, that every ending, and every twist and turn pro-ducing that ending, is already programmed on the disc? There’s nothing “spooky” about it. It’s just technology. And if you think that the technology of video games is something, wait ‘til you see the technology of the uni-verse! Think of the Cosmic Wheel as that CD-ROM. All the endings already exist. The universe is just waiting to see which one you choose this time. And when the game is over, whether you win, lose, or draw, the universe will say, “Want to play again?” Your computer disc doesn’t care whether you win or not, and you can’t “hurt its feelings.” It just offers you a chance to play again. All the endings already exist, and which ending you experience depends on the choices you make. So God is nothing more than a CD-ROM? I wouldn’t put it that way, exactly. But throughout this dialogue I have been trying to use illustrations that embody concepts everyone can hold in their under-standing. So I think the CD-ROM illustration is a good one. In many ways, life is like a CD-ROM. All the possi-bilities exist and have already occurred. Now you get to select which one you choose to experience. This relates directly to your question about Earth changes. What many of the psychics are saying about the Earth changes is true. They have opened a window onto the “future,” and they have seen it. The question is, which “future” have they seen? As with the end of the game on the CD-ROM, there is more than one version. In one version, the Earth will be in upheaval. In an-other version, it won’t. Actually, all of the versions have already happened. Remember, time— —I know, I know. “Time does not exist”— —that’s right. And so? So everything’s happening at once. Right again. All that has ever happened, is happening now, and ever will happen, exists right now. just as all the moves in the computer game exist right now on that disc. So if you think it would be interesting for the doomsday predictions of the psychics to come true, focus all your at-tention on that, and you can draw that to yourself. And if you think you would like to experience a different reality, focus on that, and that is the outcome you can draw to you. So You won’t tell me whether the Earth changes will occur or not, is that it? I am waiting for you to tell Me. You will decide, by your thoughts, words, and actions. How about the Year 2000 computer problem? There are those who are saying now that what we are now calling the “Y2K” glitch is going to be the cause of a great upheaval in our social and economic systems. Will it be? What do you say? What do you choose? Do you think that you have nothing to do with any of this? I tell you, that would be inaccurate. Won’t You tell us how this will all turn out? I am not here to predict your future, and I will not do that. This much I can tell you. This much anybody can tell you. If you are not careful, you will get exactly where you are going. If, therefore, you don’t like the way you are headed, change direction. How do I do that? How can I affect such a large outcome? What should we do in the face of all these predictions of disas-ter by persons of psychic or spiritual “authority”? Go inside. Search your place of inner wisdom. See what this calls on you to do. Then do it. If that means write your politicians and your indus-trialists, asking them to take action on environmental abuses that could lead to Earth changes, do it. If that means bringing your community leaders together to work on the Y2K problem, do it. And if that means just walking your path, sending out positive energy every day, and keeping those around you from falling into a panic which brings on a problem, do it. Most important of all, do not be afraid. You cannot “die” in any event, so there is nothing to be afraid of. Be aware of The Process unfolding, and quietly know that everything is going to be okay with you. Seek to get in touch with the perfection of all things. Know that you will be exactly where you have to be in order to experience exactly what you choose as you go about creating Who You Really Are. This is the way to peace. In all things, see the perfec-tion. Finally, don’t try to “get out” of anything. What you re-sist, persists. I told you that in the first book, and it’s true. People who are sad about what they “see” in the fu-ture, or what they’ve been “told” about the future, are failing to “stay in the perfection.” Any other advice? Celebrate! Celebrate life! Celebrate Self! Celebrate the predictions! Celebrate God! Celebrate! Play the game. Bring joy to the moment, whatever the moment seems to bring, because joy is Who You Are, and Who You Will Always Be. God cannot create anything imperfect. If you think that God can create anything imperfect, then you know nothing of God. So celebrate. Celebrate the perfection! Smile and celebrate and see only the perfection, and that which others call the imperfection will not touch you in any way which is imperfect for you. You mean I can avoid the Earth shifting on its axis, or being smashed by a meteor, or being crumpled by earthquakes, or be-ing caught in a confusing and hysterical aftermath of Y2K? You can definitely avoid being affected negatively by any of that. That isn’t what I asked You. But it is what I answered. Face the future fearlessly, understanding The Process and seeing the perfection of all of it. That peace, that serenity, that calmness will lead you away from most of the experiences and outcomes others would have called “negative.” What if You are wrong about all of this? What if You are not “God” at all, but just the overworkings of my fertile imagina-tion? Ah, back to that question, eh? Well, what if? So what? Can you think of a better way to live? All I am saying here is to stay calm, stay peaceful, stay serene, in the face of these dire predictions of planet-wide calamity, and you will have the best outcome possible. Even if I’m not God, and I’m just “you,” making it all up, can you get any better advice? No, I think not. So, as usual, it makes no difference whether I’m “God” or not. With this, as with the information in all three books, just live the wisdom. Or, if you can think of a better way to proceed, do that. Look, even if it really is just Neale Donald Walsch doing the talking in all these books, you could hardly find better advice to follow, on any of the subjects covered. So look at it this way: Either I am God talking, or this Neale fellow is a pretty bright guy. What’s the difference? The difference is, if I were convinced it was really God say-ing these things, I’d listen more closely. Oh, bananas. I’ve sent you messages a thousand times in a hundred different forms, and you’ve ignored most of them. Yeah, I suppose I have. You suppose? Okay, I have. So this time, don’t ignore. Who do you suppose brought you to this book? You did. So if you can’t listen to God, listen to yourself. Or my friendly psychic. Or your friendly psychic. You’re kidding with me now, but this does bring up another subject I wanted to discuss. I know. You know? Of course. You want to discuss psychics. How did You know? I’m psychic. Hey, I’ll bet You are. You’re the Mother of all psychics. You’re the Chief Honcho, the Top Banana, the Big Cheese. You’re The Man, The Boss, The Unit, The Chairman of the Board. My man, you have got. . . it . . .. . right. Gimme five. Cool, brother. Right on. So what I want to know is, what is “psychic power”? You all have what you call “psychic power.” It is, truly, a sixth sense. And you all have a “sixth sense about things.” Psychic power is simply the ability to step out of your limited experience into a broader view. To step back. To feel more than what the limited individual you have imagined yourself to be would feet; to know more than he or she would know. It is the ability to tap into the larger truth all around you; to sense a different en-ergy. How does one develop this ability? “Develop” is a good word. It’s sort of like muscles. You all have them, yet some of you choose to develop them, whereas in others they remain undeveloped, and far less useful. To develop your psychic “muscle,” you must exer-cise it. Use it. Every day. All the time. Right now the muscle is there, but it’s small. It’s weak. It’s under-used. So you’ll get an intuitive “hit” now and then, but you won’t act on it. You’ll get a “hunch” about something, but you’ll ignore it. You’ll have a dream, or an “inspiration,” but you’ll let it pass, paying it scant attention. Thank goodness you did pay attention to the “hit” you had about this book, or you wouldn’t be reading these words now. You think you came to these words by accident? By chance? So the first step in developing psychic “power” is to know you have it, and to use it. Pay attention to every hunch you have, every feeling you feel, every intuitive “hit” you experience. Pay attention. Then, act on what you “know.” Don’t let your mind talk you out of it. Don’t let your fear pull you away from it. The more that you act on your intuition fearlessly, the more your intuition will serve you. It was always there, only now you’re paying attention to it. But I’m not talking about the always-finding-a-parking-space kind of psychic ability. I’m talking about real psychic power. The kind that sees into the future. The kind that lets you know things about people you’d have no way of knowing oth-erwise. That’s what I was talking about, too. How does this psychic power work? Should I listen to peo-ple who have it? If a psychic makes a prediction, can I change it, or is my future set in stone? How can some psychics tell things about you the minute you walk into the room? What if— Wait. That’s four different questions there. Let’s slow down a bit and try one at a time. Okay. How does psychic power work? There are three rules of psychic phenomena that will allow you to understand how psychic power works. Let’s go over them. 1. All thought is energy. 2. All things are in motion. 3. All time is now. Psychics are people who have opened themselves to the experiences these phenomena produce: vibrations. Sometimes formed as pictures in the mind. Sometimes a thought in the form of a word. The psychic becomes adept at feeling these ener-gies. This may not be easy at first, because these ener-gies are very light, very fleeting, very subtle. Like the slightest breeze on a summer night that you think you felt rustle your hair—but maybe didn’t. Like the faintest sound in the farthest distance that you think you heard, but can’t be sure. Like the dimmest flicker of an image at the corner of your eye that you swore was there, but, when you look head on, is gone. Vanished. Was it there at all? That’s the question the beginning psychic is always asking. The accomplished psychic never asks, because to ask the question sends the answer away. Asking the question engages the mind, and that’s the last thing a psychic wants to do. Intuition does not reside in the mind. To be psychic, you’ve got to be out of your mind. Because intuition resides in the psyche. In the soul. Intuition is the ear of the soul. The soul is the only instrument sensitive enough to “pick up” life’s faintest vibrations, to “feel” these ener-gies, to sense these waves in the field, and to interpret them. You have six senses, not five. They are your sense of smell, taste, touch, sight, hearing, and . . .... knowing. So here is how “psychic power” works. Every time you have a thought, it sends off an en-ergy. It is energy. The soul of the psychic picks up that energy. The true psychic will not stop to interpret it, but will probably just blurt out what that energy feels like. That’s how a psychic can tell you what you’re thinking. Every feeling you’ve ever had resides in your soul. Your soul is the sum total of all your feelings. It is the re-pository. Even though it may have been years since you’ve stored them there, a psychic who is truly open can “feel” these “feelings” here and now. That’s be-cause—all together now— There’s no such thing as time— That’s how a psychic can tell you about your “past.” “Tomorrow” also does not exist. All things are oc-curring right now. Every occurrence sends off a wave of energy, prints an indelible picture on the cosmic photo-graphic plate. The psychic sees, or feels, the picture of “tomorrow” as if it is happening right now—which it is. That is how some psychics tell the “future.” How is this done, physiologically? Perhaps without ac-tually knowing what he’s doing, a psychic, through the act of intense focusing, is sending out an actual submolecular component of himself. His “thought,” if you will, leaves the body, zings out into space, and goes far enough, fast enough, to be able to turn around and “see” from a dis-tance the “now” that you have not yet experienced. Submolecular time travel! You could say that. Submolecular time travel! Ohhhh-kay. We’ve decided to turn this into a vaudeville show. No, no, I’ll be good. I promise.. . really. Go on. I really do want to hear this. Okay. The submolecular part of the psychic, having absorbed the energy of the image gained from focusing, zings back to the psychic’s body, bringing the energy with it. The psychic “gets a picture”—sometimes with a shiver—or “feels a feeling,” and tries very hard not to do any “processing” of the data, but simply—and in-stantly—describes it. The psychic has learned not to question what he’s “thinking” or suddenly “seeing” or “feeling,” but merely to allow it to “come through” as untouched as possible. Weeks later, if the event pictured or “felt” actually occurs, the psychic is called a clairvoyant—which, of course, is true! If that’s the case, how come some “predictions” are “wrong”; that is, they never “happen”? Because the psychic has not “predicted the future,” merely offered a glimpse of one of the “possible possi-bilities” observed in the Eternal Moment of Now. It is al-ways the subject of the psychic reading who has made the choice. He could just as easily make another choice-a choice not in concert with the prediction. The Eternal Moment contains all “possible possibili-ties.” As I have explained now several times, everything has already happened, in a million different ways. All that’s left is for you to make some perception choices. It is all a question of perception. When you change your perception, you change your thought, and your thought creates your reality. Whatever outcome you could anticipate in any situation is already there for you. All you have to do is perceive it. Know it. This is what is meant by “even before you ask, I will have answered.” In truth, your prayers are “answered” before the prayer is offered. Then how come we don’t all get what we pray for? This was covered in Book 1. You don’t always get what you ask, but you always get what you create. Cre-ation follows thought, which follows perception. This is mind-boggling. Even though we’ve been over this before, this is still mind-boggling. Isn’t it, though? That’s why it’s good to keep going over it. Hearing it several times gives you a chance to wrap your mind around it. Then your mind gets “unboggled.” If everything is all happening now, what dictates which part of it all I’m experiencing in my moment of “now”? Your choices—and your belief in your choices. That belief will be created by your thoughts on a particular subject, and those thoughts arise out of your percep-tions—that is, “the way you look at it.” So the psychic sees the choice you are now making about “tomorrow,” and sees that played out. But a true psychic will always tell you it doesn’t have to be that way. You can “choose again,” and change the outcome. In effect, I’d be changing the experience I’ve already had! Exactly! Now you’re getting it. Now you’re under-standing how to live in the paradox. But if it’s “already happened,” to whom has it “happened”? And if I change it, who is the “me” that experiences the change? There is more than one of you moving down the time-line. This was all described in detail in Book 2. I’m going to suggest that you re-read that. Then combine what’s there with what’s here, for a richer understand-ing. Okay. Fair enough. But I’d like to talk about this psychic stuff a while longer. A lot of people claim to be psychic. How can I tell the real from the fake? Everyone is “psychic,” so they’re all “real.” What you want to look for is their purpose. Are they seeking to help you, or to enrich themselves? Psychics—so called “professional psychics”—who are seeking to enrich themselves often promise to do things with their psychic power—”return a lost lover,” “bring wealth and fame,” even help you lose weight! They promise they can do all this—but only for a fee. They’ll even do a “reading” on another—your boss, your lover, a friend—and tell you all about them. They’ll say, “Bring me something. A scarf, a picture, a sample of their handwriting.” And they can tell you about the other. Often, quite a bit. Because everyone leaves a trace, a “psychic finger-print,” an energy trail. And a true sensitive can feel this. But a sincere intuitive will never offer to cause an-other to come back to you, get a person to change his mind, or create any result whatsoever with her psychic “power.” A true psychic—one who has given her life to the development and use of this gift—knows that an-other’s free will is never to be tampered with, and that another’s thoughts are never to be invaded, and that another’s psychic space is never to be violated. I thought You said there is no “right” and “wrong.” What are all these “nevers” all of a sudden? Every time I lay down an “always” or a “never,” it is within the context of what I know you are seeking to ac-complish; what it is you are trying to do. I know that you are all seeking to evolve, to grow spiritually, to return to the Oneness. You are seeking to experience yourself as the grandest version of the great-est vision you ever had about Who You Are. You are seeking this individually, and as a race. Now there are no “rights” and “wrongs,” no “do’s” and “don’ts” in My world—as I have said many times-and you do not burn in the everlasting fires of hell if you make a “bad” choice, because neither “bad” nor “hell” exists—unless, of course, you think that it does. Still there are natural laws that have been built into the physical universe—and one of those is the law of cause and effect. One of the most important laws of cause and effect is this: All caused effect is ultimately experienced by the Self. What does that mean? Whatever you cause another to experience, you will one day experience. Members of your New Age community have a more colorful way of putting it. “What goes around, comes around.” Right. Others know this as the Jesus Injunction: Do unto others as you would have it done unto you. Jesus was teaching the law of cause and effect. It is what might be called the Prime Law. Somewhat like the Prime Directive given to Kirk, Picard, and Janeway. Hey, God is a Trekkie! Are you kidding? I wrote half the episodes. Better not let Gene hear You say that. Come on. . . Cene told Me to say that. You’re in touch with Gene Roddenberry? And Carl Sagan, and Bob Heinlein, and the whole gang up here. You know, we shouldn’t kid around like this. It takes away from the believability of the whole dialogue. I see. A conversation with God has to be serious. Well, at least believable. It’s not believable that I’ve got Gene, Carl, and Bob right here? I’ll have to tell them that. Well, back to how you can tell a true psychic from a “fake” one. A true psy-chic knows and lives the Prime Directive. That’s why, if you ask her to bring back a “long-lost love,” or read the aura of another person whose handkerchief or letter you have, a true psychic will tell you: “I’m sorry, but I won’t do that. I will never interfere with, intervene in, or look in on, the path walked by an-other. “I will not attempt to affect, direct, or impact their choices in any way. “And I will not divulge to you information about any individual that is personal or private.” If a person offers to perform one of these “services” for you, that person is what you would call a shyster, us-ing your own human weaknesses and vulnerabilities to extract money from you. But what about psychics who help people locate a missing loved one—a child who was abducted, a teenager who ran away and has too much pride to call home, even though they desperately want to? Or how about the classic case of locating a person—dead or alive—for the police? Of course, these questions all answer themselves. What the true psychic always avoids is imposing his will upon another. She is there only to serve. Is it okay to ask a psychic to contact the dead? Should we at-tempt to reach out to those who have “gone before”? Why would you want to? To see if they have something they want to say to us; to tell us. If somebody from “the other side” has something they want you to know, they’ll find a way to cause you to know it, don’t worry. The aunt, the uncle, the brother, the sister, the fa-ther, the mother, the spouse, and lover who have “gone before” are continuing their own journey, experiencing complete joy, moving toward total understanding. If part of what they want to do is to come back to you—to see how you are, to bring you an awareness that they’re all right, whatever—trust that they’ll do that. Then, watch for the “sign” and catch it. Don’t dis-miss it as just your imagination, “wishful thinking,” or coincidence. Watch for the message, and receive it. I know of a lady who was nursing her dying husband, and she begged him: If he had to go, please come back to her and let her know that he was all right. He promised he would, and died two days later. Not a week went by when the lady was awak-ened one night by the feeling that someone had just sat down on the bed beside her. When she opened her eyes, she could have sworn she saw her husband, sitting at the foot of the bed, smiling at her. But when she blinked and looked again, he was gone. She told me the story later, saying then that she must have been hallucinating. Yes, that’s very common. You receive signs—irrefu-table, obvious signs—and you ignore them. Or dismiss them as your own mind playing tricks on you. You have the same choice now, with this book. Why do we do that? Why do we ask for something—like the wisdom contained in these three books—then refuse to believe it when we receive it? Because you doubt the greater glory of God. Like Thomas, you have to see, feel, touch, before you will believe. Yet that which you wish to know cannot be seen, felt, or touched. It is of another realm. And you are not open to that; you are not ready. Yet do not fret. When the student is ready, the teacher will appear. So are You saying, then—to get back to the original line of questioning—that we should not go to a psychic or a séance seeking to contact those on the other side? I’m not saying that you should or shouldn’t do any-thing. I’m just not sure what the point would be. Well, supposing you had something you wanted to say to the other, rather than something you wanted to hear from them? Do you imagine that you could say it and they not hear it? The slightest thought having to do with a being existing on what you call “the other side” brings that be-ing’s consciousness flying to you. You cannot have a thought or an idea about a per-son who is what you call “deceased” without that per-son’s Essence becoming completely aware of it. It is not necessary to use a medium to produce such communi-cation. Love is the best “medium” of communication. Ah, but how about two-way communication? Would a me-dium be helpful there? Or is such communication even possi-ble? Is it all hogwash? Is it dangerous? You are talking now about communication with spirits. Yes, such communication is possible. It is dan-gerous? Virtually everything is “dangerous” if you are afraid. What you fear, you create. Yet there is really nothing to be afraid of. Loved ones are never far from you, never more than a thought away, and will always be there if you need them, ready with counsel or comfort or advice. If there is a high level of stress on your part about a loved one being “okay,” they will send you a sign, a signal, a little “message” that will allow you to know everything’s fine. You won’t even have to call on them, because souls who loved you in this life are drawn to you, pulled to you, fly to you, the moment they sense the slightest trouble or disturbance in your auric field. One of their first opportunities, as they learn about the possibilities of their new existence, is to provide aid and comfort to those they love. And you will feel their comforting presence if you are really open to them. So the stories we hear of people “who could have sworn” that a deceased loved one was in the room could be true. Most assuredly. One might smell the loved one’s perfume or cologne, or get a whiff of the cigar they smoked, or faintly hear a song they used to hum. Or, out of nowhere, some personal possession of theirs may suddenly appear. A handkerchief, or a wallet, or some cufflink or piece of jewelry just “shows up” for “no rea-son.” It’s “found” in a chair cushion, or under a stack of old magazines. There it is. A picture, a photograph, of a special moment—just when you were missing that per-son and thinking about them and feeling sad about their death. These things don’t “just happen.” These kinds of things don’t “just appear” at “just the right moment” by chance. I tell you this: There are no coincidences in the universe. This is very common. Very common. Now, back to your question: Do you need a so-called “medium” or “channel” to communicate with beings out of the body? No. Is it sometimes helpful? Sometimes. So much depends, again, on the psychic or medium—and on their motivation. If someone refuses to work in this way with you—or to do any kind of “channeling” or “go-between” work—without high compensation; run, don’t walk, the other way. That person may be in it only for the money. Don’t be surprised if you get “hooked” into re-turning time and time again for weeks or months, or even years, as they play on your need or desire for con-tact with the “spirit world.” A person who is only there-as the spirit is there-to help, asks nothing for himself except what is needed to continue to do the work they seek to do. If a psychic or medium is coming from that place when she agrees to help you, make sure you offer all the help in return that you can. Don’t take advantage of such extraordinary generosity of the spirit by giving lit-tle, or not at all, when you know you could do more. Look to see who is truly serving the world, truly seeking to share wisdom and knowledge, insight and understanding, caring and compassion. Provide for those people, and provide grandly. Pay them the high-est honor. Give them the largest amount. For these are the B ringers of the Light.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/628.html","bookId":36,"book":{"id":36,"title":"与神对话 Conversations With God","description":"简介： Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Religious","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
