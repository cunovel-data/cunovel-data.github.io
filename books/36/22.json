{"id":996,"no":22,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 4","content":"Boy, we really got sidetracked there. We started out talking about Time and ended up talking about organized religion.\n \n Yes, well, that’s what it’s like talking with God. It’s hard to keep the dialogue limited.\n \n Let me see if I can summarize the points You make in Chapter 3.\n There is no time but this time; there is no moment but this moment.\n Time is not a continuum. It is an aspect of Relativity that exists in an “up and down” paradigm, with “moments” or “events” stacked on top of each other, happening or occurring at the same “time.”\n We are constantly traveling between realities in this realm of time—no time—all time, usually in our sleep. “Déj? vu” is one way we are made aware of this.\n There has never been a time when we were not —nor will there ever be.\n The concept of “Age” as it relates to souls really has to do with levels of awareness, not length of “time.”\n There is no evil.\n We are Perfect, just as we are.\n “Wrong” is a conceptualization of the mind, based in Relative Experience.\n We are making up the rules as we go along, changing them to fit our Present Reality, and that’s perfectly all right. It’s as it should be, must be, if we are to be evolving beings.\n Hitler went to heaven(!)\n Everything that happens is God’s Will—everything. That includes not just hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes, but Hitler as well. The secret of understanding is knowing the Purpose behind all events.\n There are no “punishments” after death, and all conse-quences exist only in Relative Experience, not in the Realm of the Absolute.\n Human theologies are mankind’s insane attempt to ex-plain an insane God who does not exist.\n The only way human theologies make sense is if we accept a God who makes no sense at all.\n How’s that? Another good summary?\n \n Excellent.\n \n Good. Because now I’ve got a million questions. Statements 10 and 11, for instance, beg for further clarification. Why did Hitler go to heaven? (I know You just tried to explain this, but somehow I need more.) And what is the purpose behind all events? And how does this Larger Purpose relate to Hitler and other despots?\n \n Let’s go to Purpose first.\n All events, all experiences, have as their purpose the creating of opportunity. Events and experiences are Opportunities. Nothing more, nothing less.\n It would be a mistake to judge them as “works of the devil,” “punishments from God,” “rewards from Heaven,” or anything in between. They are simply Events and Experiences—things that happen.\n It is what we think of them, do about them, be in response to them, that gives them meaning.\n Events and experiences are opportunities drawn to you—created by you individually or collectively, through consciousness. Consciousness creates experi-ence. You are attempting to raise your consciousness. You have drawn these opportunities to you in order that you might use them as tools in the creation and expe-riencing of Who You Are. Who You Are is a being of higher consciousness than you are now exhibiting.\n Because it is My Will that you should know, and experience, Who You Are, I allow you to draw to yourself whatever event or experience you choose to create in order to do that.\n \n Other Players in the Universal Game join you from time to time—either as Brief Encounters, Peripheral Participants, Temporary Teammates, Long-Term Inter-actors, Relatives and Family, Dearly Loved Ones, or Life Path Partners.\n These souls are drawn to you by you. You are drawn to them by them. It is a mutually creative experience, expressing the choices and desires of both.\n No one comes to you by accident.\n There is no such thing as coincidence.\n Nothing occurs at random.\n Life is not a product of chance.\n Events, like people, are drawn to you, by you, for your own purposes. Larger planetary experiences and developments are the result of group consciousness. They are drawn to your group as a whole as a result of the choices and desires of the group as a whole.\n \n What do You mean by the term “your group”?\n \n Group consciousness is something that is not widely understood—yet it is extremely powerful and can, if you are not careful, often overcome individual con-sciousness. You must always, therefore, endeavor to create group consciousness wherever you go, and with whatever you do, if you wish your larger life experience on the planet to be harmonious.\n If you are in a group whose consciousness does not reflect your own, and you are unable at this time to effectively alter the group consciousness, it is wise to leave the group, or the group could lead you. It will go where it wants to go, regardless of where you want to go.\n If you cannot find a group whose consciousness matches your own, be the source of one. Others of like consciousness will be drawn to you.\n \n Individuals and smaller groups must affect larger groups—and, ultimately, the largest group of all, which is ALL humankind—for there to be permanent and significant change on your planet.\n Your world, and the condition it is in, is a reflection of the total, combined consciousness of everyone living there.\n As you can see by looking around you, much work is left to be done. Unless of course, you are satisfied with your world as it is.\n Surprisingly, most people are. That is why the world does not change.\n Most people are satisfied with a world in which differences, not similarities, are honored, and disagree-ments are settled by conflict and war.\n Most people are satisfied with a world in which survival is for the fittest, “might is right,” competition is required, and winning is called the highest good.\n If such a system happens also to produce “los-ers”—so be it—so long as you are not among them.\n \n Most people are satisfied, even though such a model produces people who are often killed when they are judged “wrong,” starved and rendered homeless when they are “losers,” oppressed and exploited when they are not “strong.”\n Most people define “wrong” as that which is differ-ent from them. Religious differences, in particular, are not tolerated, nor are many social, economic, or cul-tural differences.\n Exploitation of the underclass is justified by the self-congratulatory pronouncements from the upper class of how much better off their victims are now than they were before these exploitations. By this measure the upper class can ignore the issue of how all people ought to be treated if one were being truly fair, rather than merely making a horrible situation a tiny bit bet-ter—and profiting obscenely in the bargain.\n Most people laugh when one suggests any kind of system other than the one currently in place, saying that behaviors such as competing and killing and the “victor taking the spoils” are what makes their civilization great! Most people even think there is no other natural way to be, that it is the nature of humans to behave in this manner, and that to act any other way would kill the inner spirit that drives man to succeed. (No one asks the question, “Succeed at what?”)\n Difficult as it is for truly enlightened beings to un-derstand, most people on your planet believe in this philosophy, and that is why most people don’t care about the suffering masses, the oppression of minorities, the anger of the underclass, or the survival needs of anyone but themselves and their immediate families.\n \n Most people do not see that they are destroying their Earth—the very planet which gives them Life—because their actions seek only to enhance their quality of life. Amazingly, they are not far-sighted enough to observe that short-term gains can produce long-term losses, and often do—and will.\n Most people are threatened by group conscious-ness, a concept such as the collective good, a one-world overview, or a God who exists in unity with all creation, rather than separate from it.\n This fear of anything leading to unification and your planet’s glorification of All That Separates produces division, disharmony, discord—yet you do not seem to have the ability even to learn from your own experi-ence, and so you continue your behaviors, with the same results.\n The inability to experience the suffering of another as one’s own is what allows such suffering to continue.\n Separation breeds indifference, false superiority. Unity produces compassion, genuine equality.\n The events which occur on your planet—which have occurred regularly for 3,000 years—are, as I’ve said, a reflection of the Collective Consciousness of “your group”—the whole group on your planet.\n That level of consciousness could best be described as primitive.\n \n Hmmm. Yes. But we seem to have digressed here from the original question.\n \n Not really. You asked about Hitler. The Hitler Expe-rience was made possible as a result of group conscious-ness. Many people want to say that Hitler manipulated a group—in this case, his countrymen—through the cunning and the mastery of his rhetoric. But this con-veniently lays all the blame at Hitler’s feet—which is exactly where the mass of the people want it.\n But Hitler could do nothing without the cooperation and support and willing submission of millions of peo-ple. The subgroup which called itself Germans must assume an enormous burden of responsibility for the Holocaust. As must, to some degree, the larger group called Humans, which, if it did nothing else, allowed itself to remain indifferent and apathetic to the suffering in Germany until it reached so massive a scale that even the most cold-hearted isolationists could no longer ignore it.\n \n You see, it was collective consciousness which pro-vided fertile soil for the growth of the Nazi movement. Hitler seized the moment, but he did not create it.\n It’s important to understand the lesson here. A group consciousness which speaks constantly of separation and superiority produces loss of compassion on a mas-sive scale, and loss of compassion is inevitably followed by loss of conscience.\n A collective concept rooted in strict nationalism ignores the plights of others, yet makes everyone else responsible for yours, thus justifying retaliation, “recti-fication,” and war.\n Auschwitz was the Nazi solution to—an attempt to “rectify”—the “Jewish Problem.”\n The horror of the Hitler Experience was not that he perpetrated it on the human race, but that the human race allowed him to.\n The astonishment is not only that a Hitler came along, but also that so many others went along.\n The shame is not only that Hitler killed millions of Jews, but also that millions of Jews had to be killed before Hitler was stopped.\n The purpose of the Hitler Experience was to show humanity to itself.\n Throughout history you have had remarkable teach-ers, each presenting extraordinary opportunities to re-member Who You Really Are. These teachers have shown you the highest and the lowest of the human potential.\n \n They have presented vivid, breathtaking examples of what it can mean to be human—of where one can go with the experience, of where the lot of you can and will go, given your consciousness.\n The thing to remember: Consciousness is every-thing, and creates your experience. Group conscious-ness is powerful and produces outcomes of unspeakable beauty or ugliness. The choice is always yours.\n If you are not satisfied with the consciousness of your group, seek to change it.\n The best way to change the consciousness of others is by your example.\n If your example is not enough, form your own group—you be the source of the consciousness you wish others to experience. They will—when you do.\n It begins with you. Everything. All things.\n You want the world to change? Change things in your own world.\n \n Hitler gave you a golden opportunity to do that. The Hitler Experience—like the Christ Experience—is pro-found in its implications and the truths it revealed to you about you. Yet those larger awarenesses live—in the case of Hitler or Buddha, Genghis Kahn or Hare Krishna, Attila the Hun or Jesus the Christ—only so long as your memories of them live.\n That is why Jews build monuments to the Holocaust and ask you never to forget it. For there is a little bit of Hitler in all of you—and it is only a matter of degree.\n Wiping out a people is wiping out a people, whether at Auschwitz or Wounded Knee.\n \n So Hitler was sent to us to provide us a lesson about the horrors man can commit, the levels to which man can sink?\n \n Hitler was not sent to you. Hitler was created by you. He arose out of your Collective Consciousness, and could not have existed without it. That is the lesson.\n The consciousness of separation, segregation, supe-riority—of “we” versus “they,” of “us” and “them “—is what creates the Hitler Experience.\n The consciousness of Divine Brotherhood, of unity, of Oneness, of “ours” rather than “yours”/”mine,” is what creates the Christ Experience.\n When the pain is “ours,” not just “yours,” when the joy is “ours,” not just “mine,” when the whole life experience is Ours, then it is at last truly that—a Whole Life experience.\n \n Why did Hitler go to heaven?\n \n Because Hitler did nothing “wrong.” Hitler simply did what he did. I remind you again that for many years millions thought he was “right.” How, then, could he help but think so?\n If you float out a crazy idea, and ten million people agree with you, you might not think you’re so crazy.\n The world decided—finally—that Hitler was “wrong.” That is to say, the world’s people made a new assessment of Who They Are, and Who They Chose To Be, in relationship to the Hitler Experience.\n He held up a yardstick! He set a parameter, a border against which we could measure and limit our ideas about ourselves. Christ did the same thing, at the other end of the spectrum.\n There have been other Christs, and other Hitlers. And there will be again. Be ever vigilant, then. For people of both high and low consciousness walk among you—even as you walk among others. Which con-sciousness do you take with you?\n \n I still don’t understand how Hitler could have gone to heaven; how he could have been rewarded for what he did?\n \n First, understand that death is not an end, but a beginning; not a horror, but a joy. It is not a closing down, but an opening up.\n The happiest moment of your life will be the mo-ment it ends.\n That’s because it doesn’t end but only goes on in ways so magnificent, so full of peace and wisdom and joy, as to make it difficult to describe and impossible for you to comprehend.\n So the first thing you have to understand—as I’ve already explained to you—is that Hitler didn’t hurt any-one. In a sense, he didn’t inflict suffering, he ended it.\n It was the Buddha who said “Life is suffering.” The Buddha was right.\n \n But even if I accept that—Hitler didn’t know he was actually doing good. He thought he was doing bad!\n \n No, he didn’t think he was doing something “bad.” He actually thought he was helping his people. And that’s what you don’t understand.\n No one does anything that is “wrong,” given their model of the world. If you think Hitler acted insanely and all the while knew that he was insane, then you under-stand nothing of the complexity of human experience.\n Hitler thought he was doing good for his people. And his people thought so, too! That was the insanity of it! The largest part of the nation agreed with him!\n You have declared that Hitler was “wrong.” Good. By this measure you have come to define yourself, know more about yourself. Good. But don’t condemn Hitler for showing you that.\n Someone had to.\n \n You cannot know cold unless there is hot, up unless there is down, left unless there is right. Do not condemn the one and bless the other. To do so is to fail to understand.\n For centuries people have been condemning Adam and Eve. They are said to have committed Original Sin. I tell you this: It was the Original Blessing. For without this event, the partaking of the knowledge of good and evil, you would not even know the two possibilities existed! Indeed, before the so-called Fall of Adam, these two possibilities did not exist. There was no “evil.” Everyone and everything existed in a state of constant perfection. It was, literally, paradise. Yet you didn’t know it was paradise—could not experience it as per-fection—because you knew nothing else.\n Shall you then condemn Adam and Eve, or thank them?\n And what, say you, shall I do with Hitler?\n I tell you this: God’s love and God’s compassion, God’s wisdom and God’s forgiveness, God’s intention and God’s purpose, are large enough to include the most heinous crime and the most heinous criminal.\n You may not agree with this, but it does not matter. You have just learned what you came here to discover.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/604.html","bookId":36,"book":{"id":36,"title":"与神对话 Conversations With God","description":"简介： Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Religious","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
