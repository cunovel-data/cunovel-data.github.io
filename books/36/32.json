{"id":1006,"no":32,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 14","content":"I am confused. Can we go back just a bit? There seems to be some contradictory data. I felt that You were saying that sometimes the best help we can give people is to leave them alone. Then I felt You were saying, never fail to help someone if you see that person needs help. These two statements seem to be at odds.\n \n Let Me clarify your thinking on this.\n Never offer the kind of help that disempowers.\n Never insist on offering the help you think is needed.\n Let the person or people in need know all that you have to give—then listen to what they want; see what they are ready to receive.\n Offer the help that is wanted. Often, the person or people will say, or exhibit by their behavior, that they just want to be left alone. Despite what you think you’d like to give, leaving them alone might be the Highest Gift you can then offer.\n If, at a later time, something else is wanted or desired, you will be caused to notice if it is yours to give. If it is, then give it.\n Yet strive to give nothing which disempowers. That which disempowers is that which promotes or produces dependency.\n \n In truth, there is always some way you can help others which also empowers them.\n Completely ignoring the plight of another who is truly seeking your help is not the answer, for doing too little no more empowers the other than doing too much. To be of higher consciousness, you may not deliberately ignore the genuine plight of brothers or sisters, claiming that to let them “stew in their own juice” is the highest gift you can give them. That attitude is righteousness and arrogance at the highest level. It merely allows you to justify your noninvolvement.\n I refer you again to the life of Jesus and to his teachings.\n For it was Jesus who told you that I would say to those on My right, Come, you blessed of My children, inherit the kingdom which I have had prepared for you.\n For I was hungry and you gave Me to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me to drink; I was homeless, and you found Me shelter.\n I was naked and you clothed Me; I was ill and you visited Me; I was in prison and you brought Me comfort.\n \n And they will say to Me, Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You? Or thirsty, and give You drink? And when did we see You homeless and find You shelter? Or naked, and clothe You? And when did we see You ill, or in prison, and comfort You?\n And I will answer them, replying:\n Verily, verily, I say unto you—inasmuch as you have done it to the least of these, My brethren, so have you done it to Me.\n This is My truth, and it still stands for all the ages.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/614.html","bookId":36,"book":{"id":36,"title":"与神对话 Conversations With God","description":"简介： Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Religious","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
