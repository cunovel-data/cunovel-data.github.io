{"id":78778,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Back at the Chateau Bronnitsy in the middle of the following afternoon, Dragosani found Borowitz absent. His secretary told him that Natasha Borowitz had died just two days ago; Gregor Borowitz was in mourning at their dacha, keeping her company for a day or two; he did not wish to be disturbed. Dragosani phoned him anyway. \u0027Ah, Boris,\u0027 the old man\u0027s voice was soft for once, empty. \u0027So you\u0027re back.\u0027 \u0027Gregor, I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 said Dragosani, observing a ritual he didn\u0027t really understand. \u0027But I thought you\u0027d like to know I got what you wanted. More than you wanted. Shukshin is dead. Gormley too. And I know everything.\u0027 \u0027Good,\u0027 said the other without emotion. \u0027But don\u0027t talk to me now of death, Boris. Not now. I shall be here for another week. After that... it will be a while before I\u0027m up to much. I loved this argumentative, tough old bitch. She had a tumour, they say, in her head. Suddenly it grew too big. Very peaceful at the end. I miss her a lot. She never knew what a secret was! That was nice.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 Dragosani said again. At that Borowitz seemed to snap out of it. \u0027So take a break,\u0027 he said. \u0027Get it all down on paper. Report to me in a week, ten days. And well done!\u0027 Dragosani\u0027s hand tightened on the telephone. \u0027A break would be very welcome,\u0027 he said. \u0027I may use it to look up an old friend of mine. Gregor, can I take Max Batu with me? He, too, has done his work well.\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes - only don\u0027t bother me any more now. Goodbye, Dragosani.\u0027 And that was that. Dragosani didn\u0027t like Batu, but he did have plans for him. Anyway, the man made a decent travelling companion: he said very little, kept himself more or less to himself, and his needs were few. He did have a passion for slivovitz, but that didn\u0027t present a problem. The little Mongol could drink the stuff until it came out of his ears, and still he would appear sober. Appearance was all that mattered. It was the middle of the Russian winter and so they went by train, a much interrupted journey which didn\u0027t see them into Galatz until a day and a half later. There Dragosani hired a car with snow chains, which gave him back something of the independence he so relished. Eventually, on the evening of that second day, in the rooms which Dragosani found for them in a tiny village near Valeni, finally the necromancer grew bored with Batu\u0027s silence and asked him: \u0027Max, don\u0027t you wonder what we\u0027re doing here? Aren\u0027t you interested to find out why I brought you along?\u0027 \u0027No, not really,\u0027 answered the moon-faced Mongol. \u0027I\u0027ll find out when you\u0027re ready, I suppose. Actually, it makes no difference. I think I quite like travelling. Perhaps the Comrade General will find more work for me in strange parts.\u0027 Dragosani thought: No, Max, there\u0027ll be no more work for you - except through me. But out loud he said only, \u0027Perhaps.\u0027 Night had fallen by the time they had eaten, and that was when Dragosani gave Batu the first hint of what was to come. \u0027It\u0027s a fine night tonight, Max,\u0027 he said. \u0027Bright starlight and not a cloud in sight. That\u0027s good, for we\u0027re going for a drive. There\u0027s someone I want to talk to.\u0027 On their way to the cruciform hills they passed a field where sheep huddled together in a corner where straw had been put out for them. There was a thin layer of snow but the temperature was at a reasonable level. Dragosani stopped the car. \u0027My friend will be thirsty,\u0027 he explained, \u0027but he\u0027s not much on slivovitz. Still, I think it\u0027s only fair we should take him something to drink.\u0027 They got out of the car and Dragosani went into the field, scattering the sheep. \u0027That one, Max,\u0027 he said, as one of the animals strayed close to the Mongol where he leaned on the fence. \u0027Don\u0027t kill it. Merely stun it, if you can.\u0027 Max could. He crouched, his face contorting where he directed his gaze through the bars of the fence. Dragosani averted his face as the sheep, a fine ewe, gave a shrill cry of terror. He looked back in time to see the animal bound as if shot, and collapse in a shuddering heap of dense wool. Together they bundled the animal into the boot and went on their way. After a little while Batu said: \u0027Your friend must have the strangest appetite, Comrade.\u0027 \u0027He does, Max, he does.\u0027 And then Dragosani told the other something of what he could expect. Batu thought about it for some minutes before he spoke again. \u0027Comrade Dragosani, I know you are a strange man - indeed we are both strange men - but now I am tempted to believe you must be mad!\u0027 Dragosani bayed like a hound, finally brought his booming laughter under control. \u0027You mean you don\u0027t believe in vampires, Max?\u0027 \u0027Oh, indeed I do!\u0027 said the other. \u0027If you say so. I don\u0027t mean that you\u0027re mad to believe - but you are certainly mad to want to dig the thing up!\u0027 \u0027We shall see what we shall see,\u0027 Dragosani growled, more soberly now. \u0027There\u0027s just one thing, Max. What ever you hear or see - no matter what may happen - you are not to interfere. I don\u0027t want him to know you\u0027re even here. Not yet, anyway. Do you understand what I\u0027m saying? You\u0027re to stay out of it. You\u0027re to be so still and quiet that even I forget you\u0027re there!\u0027 \u0027As you will,\u0027 the other shrugged. \u0027But you say he reads your mind. Perhaps he already knows I\u0027m with you.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Dragosani, \u0027for I can sense when he\u0027s trying to get at me and I know how to shut him out. Anyway, he\u0027ll be very weak by now and not up to fighting with me, not even mentally. No, Thibor Ferenczy has no idea that I\u0027m here, Max, and he\u0027ll be so delighted when I speak to him that he won\u0027t think to look for treachery.\u0027 \u0027If you say so,\u0027 and Batu shrugged again. \u0027Now,\u0027 said Dragosani, \u0027you have said I must be mad. Far from it, Max. But you see this vampire has secrets that only the undead know. They are secrets I want. And one way or the other I intend to get them. Especially now that there\u0027s this Harry Keogh to deal with. So far Thibor has frustrated me, but not this time. And if I have to raise him up to get at these secrets... then so be it!\u0027 \u0027And do you know how? - to raise him up, I mean?\u0027 \u0027Not yet, no. But he\u0027ll tell me, Max. Be sure of that...\u0027 They were there. Dragosani parked the car off the road under the cover of overhanging trees, and in the cold bright light of the stars they trudged slowly up the overgrown fire break together, snaring the burden of the twitching sheep between them. Approaching the secret glade, Dragosani took the animal on his shoulder and whispered: \u0027Now, Max, you\u0027re to stay here. You may follow a little closer if you wish, and watch by all means - but remember, keep out of it!\u0027 The other nodded, came a few paces closer, huddled down and wrapped his overcoat tightly about himself. And alone Dragosani went on under the trees and up to the tomb of the Thing in the ground. He paused at the rim of the circle, but farther out than when last he\u0027d visited. \u0027How now, old dragon?\u0027 he softly said, letting the trembling, half-dead ewe thump to the hard ground at his feet. \u0027How now, Thibor Ferenczy, you who have made a vampire of me!\u0027 He spoke softly so that Max Batu could not hear, for as always he found it easier to speak out loud than merely think his conversation at the vampire. Ahhhh! came the mental hiss, drawn out and sighing, like the waking breath of one roused from deepest dreams. And is it you, Dragosani? Ho! - and so you\u0027ve guessed, have you? \u0027It didn\u0027t take much guesswork, Thibor. It has been only a matter of months, but I\u0027m a changed man. Indeed, not entirely a man.\u0027 But no rage, Dragosani? No fury? Why, it seems to me that this time you come almost humbly! Why is that? I wonder. \u0027Oh, you know why, old dragon. I want rid of this thing.\u0027 Ah, no (a mental shake of some monstrous head) unfortunately not. That is quite impossible. You and he are one now, Dragosani. And did I not call you my son, right from the very beginning? It is only fitting, I think, that my real son now grows within you. And he laughed in Dragosani\u0027s mind. Dragosani couldn\u0027t afford the luxury of anger. Not yet. \u0027Son?\u0027 he pressed. \u0027This thing you put in me? Son? Another lie, old devil? Who was it told me that your sort have no sex?\u0027 / think you never listen, Dragosani, the vampire sighed. You, his host, have determined his sex! As he grows and becomes more properly part of you, so you become more like him. In the end it is one creature, one being. \u0027But with his mind?\u0027 With your mind - but subtly altered. Your mind and your body too, but both changed a little. Your appetites will be... sharper? Your needs... different. Listen: as a man your lusts, passions and rages were limited by a man\u0027s strength, a man\u0027s capabilities. But as one of the Wamphyri... What end would it serve to have that great engine in you with nothing to drive but a bundle of soft flesh and brittle bones? What - a tiger with the heart of a mouse? Which was more or less what Dragosani had expected from the monster. But before coming to a final, perhaps irrevocable decision, he tried one last time, made one last threat. \u0027Then I shall go away and give myself into the hands of physicians. They\u0027re a different breed to the doctors you knew in your day, Thibor. And I shall tell them a vampire is in me. They\u0027ll examine, discover, cut the thing out. They have tools you wouldn\u0027t dream of. When they have it they\u0027ll cut it open, study it, discover its nature. And they\u0027ll want to know how and why. I shall tell them. About the Wamphyri. Oh, they\u0027ll laugh, measure me up for a strait-jacket - but they won\u0027t be able to explain it away. And so I shall bring them here, show them you. It will be the end. Of you, of your \"son\", of an entire legend. And wherever the Wamphyri are, men will seek them out and destroy them...\u0027 Well said, Dragosani! Thibor was dryly sardonic. Bravo! Dragosani waited, and after a moment: \u0027Is that all you have to say?\u0027 It is. I don\u0027t converse with fools. \u0027Explain yourself.\u0027 Now the voice in his mind grew extremely cold and angry, a controlled anger now, but real and frightening for all that. You are a vain and egotistical and stupid man, Boris Dragosani, said Thibor Ferenczy. Always it is \"tell me this\" and \"show me that\" and \"explain\"! I was a power in the land for centuries before you were even spawned, and even that would not have happened but for me! And here I must lie and let myself be used. Well, all that is at an end. Very well, I will \"explain myself as you demand, but for the very last time. For after that... then it will be time for proper discussion and proper bargaining. I\u0027m tired of lying here, inert, Dragosani, as you well know, and you have the power to get me up out of here. That is the only reason I\u0027ve been patient with you at all! But now my patience is no more. First let us deal with your assessment of your situation. You say that you will give yourself into the hands of physicians. Well, by now certainly the vampire will be discernible in you. It is there, physically and tangibly, a real organism existing with you in a son of symbiosis - a word you taught me, Dragosani. But cut it out? Exorcise it? Skilled your doctors may well be, but not that skilled! Can they cut it from the individual whorls of your brain? From the fluids of your spine? From your tripes, your heart itself? Can they wrest it from your very blood? Even if you were fool enough to let them try, the vampire would kill you first. It would eat through your spine, leak poison into your brain. Surely by now you have come to understand something of our tenacity? Or did you perhaps think that survival was a purely human trait? Survival -hah! - you do not know the meaning of the word! Dragosani was silent. We made promises, you and I, the Thing in the ground finally continued. / have kept my part of the bargain. Now then, what of yours? Is it not time I was paid, Dragosani? \u0027Bargain?\u0027 Dragosani was taken aback. \u0027Are you joking? What bargain?\u0027 Have you forgotten? You wanted the secrets of the Wamphyri. Very well, they are yours. For now you are a Wamphyri! As he grows within you, so the knowledge will come. He has arts which you will learn together. \u0027What?\u0027 Dragosani was outraged. \u0027My impregnation by a vampire, with a vampire, was your part of the bargain? What the hell was that for a bargain? I wanted knowledge, wanted it now, Thibor! For myself - not as the black, rotten fruit of some unnatural, unwanted liaison with a damned parasite thing!\u0027 You dare spurn my egg? For each Wamphyri life there is but one spawning, one new life to move on down through the centuries. And I gave mine to you... \u0027Don\u0027t act the proud father with me, Thibor Ferenczy!\u0027 Dragosani raged. \u0027Don\u0027t even try and make out I\u0027ve hurt your pride. I want rid of this bastard thing in me. Do you tell me you care for it? But I know you vampires hate one another even worse than men hate you!\u0027 The Thing in the ground knew that Dragosani had seen through him. Proper discussion, proper bargaining, he said, coldly. \u0027The hell with bargaining - I want rid of it!\u0027 Dragosani snarled. Tell me how... and then I\u0027ll raise you up.\u0027 For long moments there was silence. Then - You cannot do it. Your doctors cannot do it. Only I can abort what I put there. \u0027Then do it.\u0027 \u0027What? While I lie here, in the ground? Impossible! Raise me up... and it shall be done. Now it was Dragosani\u0027s turn to ponder the vampire\u0027s proposition - or at least to pretend to ponder it. And finally: \u0027Very well. How do I go about it?\u0027 Thibor was eager now: First, do you do this of your own free will? \u0027You know I do not!\u0027 Dragosani was scornful. \u0027I do it to be free of the hag in me.\u0027 But of your own free will? Thibor insisted. \u0027Yes, damn you!\u0027 Good. First there are chains here, in the earth. They were used to bind me but have long since worked loose of wasted tissues. You see, Dragosani, there are chemical ingredients which the Wamphyri find intolerable. Silver and iron in the correct proportions paralyse us. Even though much of the iron has rusted away, its essence remains in the ground. And the silver is here, too. First, then, you must dig out these silver chains. \u0027But I haven\u0027t the tools!\u0027 You have your hands. \u0027You wish me to grub in the dirt with my hands? How deep?\u0027 Not deep at all but shallow.Through all the long centuries I\u0027ve worked these silver chains to the surface, hoping someone would find them and take them for treasure. Is silver precious still, Dragosani? \u0027More than ever.\u0027 Then take it with my blessing. Come, dig. \u0027But - \u0027 (Dragosani did not want to appear to be stalling, but on the other hand there were certain arrange\u0026shy;ments still to be made). \u0027 - how long will it take? The entire process, I mean? And what does it involve?\u0027 We start it tonight, said the vampire, and tomorrow we finish it. \u0027I can\u0027t actually bring you up out of the ground until tomorrow?\u0027 Dragosani tried not to show too much relief. Not until then, no. I am too weak, Dragosani. But I note you\u0027ve brought me a gift. That is very good. I shall derive a little strength from your offering... and after you have taken away the chains -\u0027Very well,\u0027 said the necromancer. \u0027Where do I dig?\u0027 Come closer, my son. Come to the very centre of this place. There - there! Now you can dig ... The flesh crept on Dragosani\u0027s back as he got down on hands and knees and tore at the dirt and leaf-mould with his fingers. Cold sweat started to his brow - but not from his effort - as he remembered the last time he was here, and what had happened then. The vampire sensed his apprehension and chuckled darkly in his mind: Oh, and do you fear me, Dragosani? For all your bluff and bluster? What? A brave young blood like you, and old Thibor Ferenczy just a poor undead Thing in the ground? Bah! Shame on you, my son! Dragosani had scraped most of the surface soil and debris to one side and was now five or six inches deep. He had reached the harder, more solidly frozen earth of the grave itself. But as he drove his fingers yet again into that strangely fertile soil, so they contacted something hard, something that clinked dully. He worked harder then, and the first links he uncovered were of solid silver - and massive! The links were at least two inches long, and forged of silver rods at least half an inch thick! \u0027How... how much of this stuff is there?\u0027 he gasped. Enough to keep me down, Dragosani, came the answer. Until now. The vampire\u0027s words, simple and spontaneous as they were, nevertheless contained a menacing something which set the short hairs at the back of Dragosani\u0027s neck standing erect in a moment. Thibor\u0027s mental voice had bubbled like boiling glue, filled with all the evil of the pit itself. Dragosani was a necromancer - he knew himself for a monster - but next to the old devil in the ground he felt innocent as a babe! He caught hold of a great rope of silver links, stood up, used a strength which astonished even him to rip up the chains from the earth. They came up, cracking open the ground, erupting in scabs of clotted soil and crusts of dusty, smoking leaf-mould; even shaking the roots of the trees which had grown up through all the long years to cover this place and keep it secret. And dragging the treasure in three trips to the outer rim of the circle of roots and shattered flags and torn earth, Dragosani calculated that there must be at least five or six hundred pounds of the stuff! In the Western World he would be a rich man. But in Moscow ... to even try to profit from it would be worth ten years in the Siberian salt mines at least. No such thing as treasure trove in the USSR - only theft! On the other hand, what good was treasure to him? No good at all, except as a means to an end. He couldn\u0027t enjoy the fruits of his labours like other men. But one day soon he would be able to enjoy, when other men -all other men - crawled to his feet, and world leaders came to do obeisance in the courts of the Great Wallachian Hyper-State. These were thoughts Dragosani kept hidden as he hauled the last of the chains aside and stood panting, staring in darkness at the scarred, riven earth of this secret place. And he gave a wry snort of self-derision as he remem\u0026shy;bered a time when it would have been hard to see anything at all in this dark place, even with his cat\u0027s eyes. But now: why, it was like daylight! Yet another proof that a vampire lived in him, battening on his body as it would one day attempt to batten on his mind. And as for Thibor\u0027s promise to abort the thing: Dragosani knew that wasn\u0027t worth a handful of tomb-dirt! Well, if he must live with the leech so be it; but he would be master and not the beast within. Somehow, somewhere, he would find a way. And these thoughts, too, he kept to himself... At last he was done and the silver chains lay in a great circle all about the torn-up area. \u0027There,\u0027 he told the Thing in the ground. \u0027All finished. Nothing to keep you down now, Thibor Ferenczy.\u0027 You\u0027ve done well, Dragosani. I\u0027m well pleased. But now I must feed and then I must rest. It is no easy thing to return from the grave. So now your offering, if you please, which I trust you\u0027ll leave me in peace to enjoy. I shall require the same again tomorrow night, before I can stand with you under the stars. Then, and only then, will you too be free... Dragosani kicked the ewe which at once started to life. He trapped the shivering animal between his legs as it lurched to its feet, yanked back its head. The glittering blade he wielded passed through the front part of its neck effortlessly, coming away clean before the first spurt of blood gushed out on to the dark, unhallowed ground. Then he picked the shuddering animal up - as a man might pick up a cat, by scruff of neck and rump - and spun with it, tossing it centrally into the circle. It thudded down, and again came to its feet - and only then seemed to realise that it was hurt and that this was the end. Awash in blood the beast fell on its side, kicking spastically in its own reek as the rest of its life pumped out of it. Dragosani stepped back then, and farther yet, and in his mind he heard the vampire\u0027s great deep sigh of pleasure, of monstrous craving. Ahhhh! Not greatly to my taste, Dragosani, but satisfying beyond a doubt. I owe you thanks, my son, but they can wait until tomorrow. Now begone, for I\u0027m tired and hungry, and loneliness is a drug whose addiction I\u0027ve not yet broken... Dragosani needed no second bidding. He backed away from the broken tomb, from the twitching, huddled shape at the centre of the circle. But even as he went his eyes were on the alert for some sign of the vampire\u0027s new freedom, its mobility. Oh, yes! - for Thibor Ferenczy was mobile now - the necromancer could feel him underfoot, could sense him stretching himself, could almost hear the creak of leathery muscles and the groan of old bones as they soaked in blood and something of their brittleness went out of them. Then - The ewe\u0027s carcass sagged, slumped lower, closer to the blood-soaked earth. It was as if some seismic suction had pulled at the animal, as if the earth itself were a mouth that sucked. Something moved beneath the slaughtered beast, but Dragosani could make out nothing for certain. He backed away, backed up against a tree and quickly groped his way around it, putting the rough bole between himself and what was happening. But still he kept his eyes riveted on the ewe\u0027s carcass. The animal was large and heavy with wool, but even as Dragosani watched so it seemed its bulk shrank down a little, caved in upon itself - diminished! The necromancer sent out a mental probe towards the Thing in the ground, but such was the lusting bestiality it was met with that he at once withdrew it. And still the ewe continued to shrink, shrivel, dwindle away. And as the ewe was devoured, so the cold ground about began to smoke, a stinking mist rising and rapidly thickening, obscuring the rest of the act. It was as if the earth sweated - or as if something down there breathed, which had not breathed for a long, long time. That was enough. Dragosani turned away and quickly joined Max Batu. With a finger to his lips he beckoned the other to follow, and quickly they descended the fire\u0026shy;break together and made their way back to the car. Earlier that same day and some seven hundred miles away, Harry Keogh decided, standing at the grave of August Ferdinand Mobius, (born 1790, died 26th September 1868) that it had been a very bad day for the science of numbers, a very bad day indeed. Or more specifically, a bad day for topology, and not forgetting astronomy. The day in question was the date of Mobius\u0027 death, of course. There had been students here earlier - East German, mainly, but much like students anywhere else in the world - long-haired and tattily attired; but properly respectful, Harry had thought. And so they should be. He, too, felt respectful; even awed that he stood in the presence of such a man. In any case, not wanting to appear too strange, Harry had waited until he was alone. Also, he had needed to think how best to approach Mobius. This was no ordinary figure lying here but a thinker who\u0027d helped guide science along many of the right paths. Finally Harry had settled for a direct approach; seating himself, he let his thoughts reach out and touch those of the dead man. A calm came over Harry then; his eyes took on their strange, glassy look; for all that it was bitterly cold, a fine patina of sweat gleamed on his brow. And slowly he grew aware that indeed Mobius - or what remained of him - was here. And active! Formulae, tables of figures, astronomical distances and non-Euclidean, Riemannian configurations beat against Harry\u0027s awareness like the pulses of mighty, living com\u0026shy;puters. But ... all of this in one mind? A mind which processed all of these thoughts very nearly simul\u0026shy;taneously? And then it dawned on Harry that Mobius was working on something, flipping through the pages of memory and learning as he sought to tie together the elements of a puzzle too complex for Harry\u0027s - or for any merely living man\u0027s - comprehension. All very well, but it might go on for days. And Harry simply didn\u0027t have the time. \u0027Sir? Excuse me, sir? My name is Harry Keogh. I\u0027ve come a long way to see you.\u0027 The phantasmal flow of figures and formulae stopped at once, like a computer switched off. \u0027Eh? What? Who?\u0027 \u0027Harry Keogh, sir. I\u0027m an Englishman.\u0027 There was a slight pause before the other snapped: \u0027English? I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re an Arab! I\u0027ll tell you what you are: you\u0027re a nuisance! Now what is this, eh? What\u0027s it all about? I\u0027m quite unused to this sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m a necroscope,\u0027 Harry explained as best he could. \u0027I can talk to the dead.\u0027 \u0027Dead? Talk to the dead? Hmm! I considered that, yes, and long ago came to the conclusion that I was. So obviously you can. Well, it comes to us all - death, I mean. Indeed it has its advantages. Privacy, for one - or so I thought until now! A necroscope, you say? A new science?\u0027 Harry had to smile. \u0027I suppose you could call it that. Except I seem to be its one practitioner. Spiritualists aren\u0027t quite the same thing.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll say they\u0027re not! Fraudulent bunch at best. Well then, how can I help you, Harry Keogh? I mean, I suppose you\u0027ve a reason for disturbing me? A good reason, that is?\u0027 \u0027The best in the world,\u0027 said Harry. The fact is I\u0027m tracking down a fiend, a murderer. I know who he is but I don\u0027t know how to bring him to justice. All I have is a clue as to how I might set about it, and that\u0027s where you come in.\u0027 Tracking down a murderer? A talent like yours and you use it to track down murderers? Boy, you should be out talking to Euclid, Aristotle, Pythagorus! No, cancel that last. You\u0027d get nothing from him. Him and his damned secretive Pythagorean Brotherhood! It\u0027s a wonder he even passed on his Theorem! Anyway, what is this clue of yours?\u0027 Harry showed him a mental projection of the Mobius strip. \u0027It\u0027s this,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s what ties the futures of my quarry and myself together.\u0027 Now the other was interested. Topology in the time dimension? That leads to all sorts of interesting questions. Are you talking about your probable futures or your actual futures? Have you spoken to Gauss? He\u0027s the one for probability - and topology, for that matter. Gauss was a master when I was a mere student - albeit a brilliant student!\u0027 \u0027Actual,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Our actual futures.\u0027 \u0027But that is to presuppose that you know something of the future in the first place. And is precognition another talent of yours, Harry?\u0027 (A little sarcasm.) \u0027Not mine, no, but I do have friends who occasionally\" catch glimpses of the future, just as surely as I -\u0027 Twaddle!\u0027 Mobius cut him off. \u0027Zollnerists all!\u0027 \u0027 - talk to the dead.\u0027 Harry finished it anyway. The other was silent for a moment or two. Then: Tm probably a fool... but I think I believe you. At least I believe you believe, and that you have been misled. But for the life of me I can\u0027t see how my believing in you will help you in your quest.\u0027 \u0027Neither can I,\u0027 said Harry dejectedly. \u0027Except... what about the Mobius strip? I mean, it\u0027s all I have to go on. Can\u0027t you at least explain it to me? After all, who would know more about it than you? You invented it!\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 (a mental shake of the head,) \u0027they merely stamped my name on it. Invented it? Ridiculous! I noticed it, that\u0027s all. As for explaining it: once there was a time when that would be the very simplest thing. Now, however -\u0027 Harry waited. \u0027What year is this?\u0027 The abrupt change of subject bewildered Harry. \u0027Nine teen seventy-seven,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Really?\u0027 (Astonishment.) \u0027As long as that? Well, well! And so you see for yourself, Harry, that I\u0027ve been lying here for more than a hundred years. But do you think I\u0027ve been idle? Not a bit of it! Numbers, my boy, the ultimate answer to all the riddles of the universe. Space and its curvature and qualities and properties - properties still largely unimagined, I imagine, in the world of the living. Except I don\u0027t have to imagine, for I know! But explain it? Are you a mathematician, Harry?\u0027 \u0027I know a little.\u0027 \u0027Astronomy?\u0027 Reluctantly, Harry shook his head. \u0027What is your understanding of science - of SCIENCE, that is. Your understanding of the physical, the material, and the conjectural universe?\u0027 Again Harry shook his head. \u0027Can you understand any of ... this - \u0027 and a stream of symbols and equations and calculi flashed up on the screen of Harry\u0027s mind, each item in its turn more complex than the last. Some of it he recognised from talks with James Gordon Hannant, some he knew through intuition, but most of it was completely alien. \u0027It\u0027s all... pretty difficult,\u0027 he finally said. \u0027Hmm!\u0027 (The slow nod of a phantom head.) \u0027But on the other hand... you do have intuition. Yes, and I believe it\u0027s strong in you! I suppose I could always teach you, Harry.\u0027 Teach me? Mathematics? Something you worked on all your life and for a hundred years since that life ended? Now who\u0027s talking twaddle? It would take me at least as long as it has taken you! Incidentally, what\u0027s a Zollnerist?\u0027 \u0027J. K. F. Zollner was a mathematician and astronomer - God help us! - who outlived me. He was also a crank and a spiritualist. To him numbers were \"magickal\"! Did I call you a Zollnerist? Unpardonable! You must forgive me. Actually, he wasn\u0027t far wrong. His topology was wrong, that\u0027s all. He tried to impose the unphysical - or mental universe - on the physical one. And that doesn\u0027t work. Space-time is a constant, fixed and immutable as pi.\u0027 That doesn\u0027t leave much room for metaphysics,\u0027 said Harry, certain by now that he\u0027d come to the wrong place. \u0027No room at all,\u0027 Mobius agreed. Telepathy?\u0027 Twaddle!\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s this, then? What am I doing right now?\u0027 Mobius was a little taken aback. But then: \u0027Necroscopy, or so I\u0027m given to believe.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s picking nits,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027What about clairvoyancy, or far-sightedness: the ability to view events at a great distance through the medium of the mind alone?\u0027 \u0027In the physical world, impossible. You would perpetuate Zollner\u0027s errors.\u0027 \u0027But I know these things can be done,\u0027 Harry contradicted. \u0027I know where there are people who do them. Not all the time, never easily or with any great accuracy, but occasionally. It is a new science, and it requires intuition.\u0027 After another pause Mobius said, \u0027Again I\u0027m tempted to believe you. What point would there be in your lying to me? Man\u0027s knowledge - of all things - increases all the time. And after all, I can do it! But then, I\u0027m not of the physical world. Not any longer...\u0027 Harry\u0027s head whirled. \u0027You can do it? Are you telling me that you can scry out distant events?\u0027 \u0027I see them, yes,\u0027 said Mobius, \u0027but not through any crystal ball. Nor are they strictly distant. Distance is relative. I go there. I go where the events I wish to watch are scheduled to occur.\u0027 \u0027But... where do you go? How?\u0027 \u0027\"How\" is the difficult bit,\u0027 said Mobius. \u0027Where is far easier. Harry, in life I wasn\u0027t only a mathematician but also an astronomer. After I died, naturally I was restricted to maths. But astronomy was in me; it was part of me; it would not let me be. And everything comes to those who wait. As time passed I began to feel the stars shining down on me, through the day as well as the night. I became aware of their weight - their mass, if you like -their great distance, the distances between them. Soon I knew far more about them than ever I had known in life, and then I determined to go and see them for myself. When you came to me I was calculating the magnitude of a nova soon to occur in Andromeda, and I shall be there to see it happen! Why not? I am unbodied. The laws of the physical universe no longer apply.\u0027 \u0027But you\u0027ve just denied the metaphysical,\u0027 Harry pro tested. \u0027And now you\u0027re saying you can teleport to the stars!\u0027 Teleportation? No, for nothing physical is moved. As I keep telling you, Harry, I am not a physical thing. There may well be a so-called \"metaphysical\" universe, but neither the real nor the unreal may impose itself upon the other.\u0027 \u0027Or so you believed until you met me!\u0027 said Harry, his strange eyes opening wider, his voice full of a new awe. For suddenly a bright star was shining in Harry\u0027s mind, but shining brighter than any nova in the mind of Mobius. \u0027What? What\u0027s that?\u0027 \u0027Are you saying,\u0027 Harry became relentless, \u0027that thereis no meeting point between the physical and the meta-physical? Is that your argument?\u0027\u0027Exactly!\u0027 \u0027And yet I am physical, and you are purely mental -and we have met! He sensed the other\u0027s gape. \u0027Astonishing! It seems I\u0027ve overlooked the obvious.\u0027 Harry pressed his advantage: \u0027You use the strip, don\u0027t you, to go out amongst the stars?\u0027 \u0027The strip? I use a variant of it, yes, but - \u0027 \u0027And you called me a Zollnerist?\u0027 For a moment Mobius was speechless. Then: \u0027It seems my arguments ... no longer apply!\u0027 \u0027You do teleport!\u0027 said Harry. \u0027You teleport pure mind. You\u0027re a scryer. That\u0027s your talent, sir! In a way it always was. Even in life you could-see things that others were blind to. The strip is a perfect example. Well, scrying in itself would be a marvellous weapon, but I want to take it a step farther. I want to impose -I mean rigidly impose -the physical me on the metaphysical universe.\u0027 \u0027Please, Harry, not so fast!\u0027 Mobius protested. \u0027I need to-\u0027 \u0027Sir, you offered to teach me,\u0027 Harry couldn\u0027t be restrained. \u0027Well, I accept. But only teach me what\u0027s absolutely necessary. Let my instinct, my intuition do the rest. My mind\u0027s a blackboard, and you\u0027ve got the chalk right there in your hand. So go ahead, teach me ... Teach me how to ride your Mobius strip!\u0027 It was night again and Dragosani had climbed back into the cruciform hills. Across his back he carried a second ewe, this one stunned with a large stone. The day had been a busy one, but its proceeds must surely show a profit; Max Batu had had the chance to display yet again the morbid power of his evil eye, this time to one Ladislau Giresci; eventually the old man would be found in his lonely house, \u0027victim of a heart attack\u0027, of course. But Max\u0027s work had not stopped there, for only an hour or so ago Dragosani had sent the Mongolian out upon another crucial mission; which meant that the necro\u0026shy;mancer was now alone - or to all intents and purposes alone - as he approached the tomb of the vampire and sent his words and thoughts before him to penetrate the cold gloom beneath dark and stirless trees. \u0027Thibor, are you sleeping? I\u0027m here as directed. The stars are bright and the night chill, and the moon is creeping on the hills. This is the hour, Thibor - for both of us.\u0027 And after a moment: Ahhhh! ... Dragosaaaniiti? Sleeping? I suppose I was. But I have slept a grand sleep, Dragosani. The sleep of the undead. And I dreamed a grand dream - of conquest and of empire! And for once my hard bed was soft as the breasts of a lover, and these old, old bones were not weighed down but buoyant as the step of a lad when he meets his lass. A grand dream, aye, but... alas, only a dream for all that. Dragosani sensed... despondency? Alarmed for his plan, he asked: \u0027Is anything wrong?\u0027 On the contrary. All goes well, my son - except I fear it may take a little longer than I thought. I took strength from your offering of yestereve, indeed I did! - and I fancy I\u0027ve even put on a little flesh. But still the ground is hard and these old sinews of mine stiff from the salts of the earth... And then, more eagerly: But did you remember, Drago\u0026shy;sani, and bring me another small tribute? Not too small, I hope? Something, perhaps, to compare with my last repast? For answer the necromancer came to a halt on the rim of the circle, tossed down from his shoulder to the ground at his feet the inert mass of the ewe in a grunting heap. \u0027I didn\u0027t forget,\u0027 he said. \u0027But come on, old dragon, tell me whatyoumean.Why willittakelonger thanyou thought?\u0027 Dragosani\u0027s disappointment was real; his plan depended upon raising the vampire up tonight. Have you no understanding, Dragosani? came Thibor\u0027s answer. Among the men who followed me when I was a warrior, many were so injured in battle that they were carried to their beds. Some would recover. But after months of lying still, often they were wasted and full of aches and torments. Picture me, then, after five hundred years! But... we shall see what we shall see. Even as we talk I grow more eager to be risen up - and so perhaps, after a little more refreshment - ? Dragosani wryly nodded his understanding, drew out a \" small glinting sickle of honed brightness from its sheath in his pocket, and stooped towards the ewe. Hold! said the vampire. As you surmise, Dragosani, this may well be the hour - for both of us. An hour of great moment! For both of us. For my own part, I think we should treat it with the respect it warrants. The necromancer frowned, cocked his head on one side. \u0027How do you mean?\u0027 So far, my son, I think you would agree that I have not stood on ceremony. For all that I have had my food hurled at me, as if I were some rooting pig, I have not complained. But I would have you know, Dragosani, that I too have supped at table. Indeed, I\u0027ve dined in the courts of princes! - aye, and will again, with you perhaps seated upon my right hand. May I not, therefore, expect treatment more nearly gracious? Or must I always remember you as a man who poured my food over me like slops into a pigsty? \u0027A bit late for niceties, isn\u0027t it, Thibor?\u0027 Dragosani wondered what the vampire was up to. \u0027What exactly do you want?\u0027 Thibor was quick to note his apprehension. What? And do you still distrust me? Well, and I suppose you have your reasons. Survival was mine. But come, have we not agreed that when I\u0027m up and about, then that I\u0027ll drive out the seed of my own flesh from your body? And in that moment, will you not be entirely in my hands? It seems a foolish thing, Dragosani, that you would put your faith in me walking abroad but not in my grave! Surely if I were so inclined, I\u0027d be capable of more harm to you up than down? Also, if it were my plan to harm you, who then would be my guide in this new world I\u0027m about to enter? You shall instruct me, Dragosani, and I you. \u0027You still haven\u0027t said what you want.\u0027 The vampire sighed. Dragosani, I am forced to admit a small personal flaw. I have in the past accused you of a certain vanity, yet now I tell you that I, too, am vain. Aye, and I would celebrate my rebirth in a manner more fitting. Therefore, bring unto me the ewe, my son, and lay it down before me. This one last time, let it be by way of a genuine tribute - even as a ritual sacrifice to one who is mighty - and not merely swill and roughage for the fattening of swine. Let me eat as from a platter, Dragosani, and not out of a trough! \u0027Old bastard!\u0027 thought Dragosani, while continuing to keep his thoughts secret. So he was to be the vampire\u0027s serf, was he? Just another poor gypsy dolt to be cuffed about and follow at heel like a whining dog? \u0027Ah, but I\u0027ve news for you my old, my too old friend!\u0027 and Dragosani hugged his secret thoughts tightly to himself. \u0027Enjoy this, Thibor Ferenczy, for it\u0027s the very last time a man will fetch and carry for the likes of you!\u0027 And out loud he said: \u0027You want me to bring you the beast, as if it were an offering?\u0027 Is it too much to ask? The necromancer shrugged. Right now, nothing was too much to ask. He would be doing a little \u0027asking\u0027 himself, shortly. He put away his razor-edged knife and took up the sheep. He carried it to the centre of the circle, crouched down and placed it where last night\u0027s offering had lain. Then again he took out his sickle blade. Until now the glade had been quiet, still as the tomb it was, but now Dragosani sensed a gathering. It was as if muscles were suddenly bunched, the silent creep of a cat\u0027s paws as it closes on a mouse, the forming of saliva on a chameleon\u0027s tongue before it strikes. Quickly, thrilling with horror of the unknown - even a monster such as Dragosani, filled with horror - he drew back the stunned beast\u0027s head and made its throat taut. And -No need for that, my son, said Thibor Ferenczy. Dragosani would have leapt away, for in that selfsame moment he knew - but knew too late - that the Thing in the ground had had its fill of piglets and sheep! Not one eighth of an inch had he straightened from his crouch before that phallic tentacle burst from the ground beneath him, shearing through his clothing like a knife and up, into him. And how he would have leapt then, to be free of it, even if the tearing should kill him; he would have leapt - but he couldn\u0027t. Growing barbs within him, the pseudopod stretched itself through all the lower conduits of his body and filled him, and drew him down like a fish yanked from water on a hook! Dragosani\u0027s feet flew out from beneath him as he was slammed down against the dark and seething earth; and after that there was no longer room even for the thought of flight. For that was when the pain, the torment, the ultimate agony commenced... His bowels were melting, his entrails were on fire, he was seated upright on a fountain of acid! And through all the incredible pain Thibor Ferenczy howled his triumph and taunted Dragosani with the truth - the real truth -the one final question whose answer had eluded the necromancer through all these years: Why did they hate me, my son? My own kith and kin, as it were? Why do all vampires hate other vampires? Why, the answer to that is the very simplest thing! The blood is the life, Dragosani! Oh, the blood of swine will suffice if there\u0027s nought better to sup, and the blood of fowls and sheep. Better far, however, the blood of men, as you\u0027ll very soon be obliged to discover for yourself. But over and above all other vessels, the true nectar of life may only be sipped from the veins of another vampire! Dragosani burned in a double hell; he felt torn apart inside; his parasite twin within clove to him in its agony as Thibor\u0027s nightmare appendage fastened upon it and leeched its essence. And yet that terrible tentacle did no real harm, no damage. Protoplasmic, it moulded itself to organs without crushing them, penetrated without puncturing. Even its barbs caused no injury, for they were fashioned to hold without tearing. The agony lay in its being there, in its contact with raw nerves and muscles and organs, in its advance through all the tracts of Dragosani\u0027s raped physical body. It could not hurt more if some insane doctor had dripped an acid solution into an open vein - but it would not kill. It could kill, certainly, but not now, not this time. In his torment Dragosani could not know that. And through his torment he cried: \u0027Get ... it... done with, damn you! Damn your... black heart, liar of liars! Kill... me, Thibor! Do it now. Put an end to it, I ... I beg you!\u0027 He sat there in the darkness under the trees amidst the shattered flags and the crumbling ruins of the ancient tomb, and horror ate at his mind like a rat set loose in his brain and left to eat its way out. Someone had set a meat mincer in motion inside him and it was reducing his guts to squirming red worms. He jerked and threshed, fell to one side. The agony drove him upright again, only to fall the other way. And so he twitched and jerked and lolled and screamed, and still Thibor Ferenczy fed. Strength you gave me, Dragosani, aye. Strength and bulk in the blood of beasts. But the true life is the blood of a fellow creature - even the thin, immature blood of that child of mine who now gibbers inside you as he grows weak from his loss even as you grow weak from pain. But kill him? Kill you? Nay, nay! What? And rob myself of a thousand feasts to come? We go together into the world, Dragosani, and you in thrall to me until that time when you shall flee. By which time you\u0027ll not need to ask but know why all the Wamphyri share a mutual bond of hate! The vampire was sated. The tentacle slid out of Dragosani and down into the earth out of sight. Its going was, if anything, even worse than its coming: a white hot sword drawn out of him by a careless hand. He cried out, a shriek that echoed like the cry of a wild thing through the cold, cruel cruciform hills, and toppled over on his side. But hadn\u0027t Thibor told him that they named the Vlad \u0027the Impaler\u0027 after him? He had, and now Dragosani could more fully understand just why! The necromancer tried to stand and could not. His legs were jelly, his brain a seething acid soup in its skull bowl. He rolled, cleared the tainted circle, again tried to rise. Impossible. Will was not enough. He lay still, sobbing in the night, gathering wits and strength both. The vampire had spoken of hate, and he had been right. It was hate that kept Dragosani conscious now. Hate and only hate. His and that of the creature within him. Both of them had been ravaged. Finally he propped himself up on his side, glared his hate at the black earth which now steamed and smoked as the vapours of hell rose up from it. Cracks appeared in the sub-soil which Dragosani had cleared. The earth bulged upward, began to break open. Something thrust up from below. Then - That same something sat up - and it was something unbelievable! Dragosani\u0027s lips drew back from his teeth in an involun\u0026shy;tary snarl of loathing, and in terror! For this was the Thing in the ground. This was what he had talked to, argued with, cursed and profaned time and time again. This was Thibor Ferenczy, the undead embodiment of his own bat-devil-dragon banner. But worse, it was what Dragosani had doomed himself one day to become! The thick ears of the thing grew close to its head but were pointed and projected slightly higher than the elongated skull, giving the appearance of horns. Its nose was wrinkled and convoluted, like that of a great bat, and squat to its face. Its skin was of scale and its eyes were scarlet, like a dragon\u0027s. And it was... big! The hands where they now appeared and clawed at the soil at its waist were huge, with nails projecting all of an inch beyond the fingers. Dragosani finally fought back his terror and forced himself to his feet - just as the vampire turned its strangely wolfish head to fix him with a monstrous, almost startled stare. And its eyes opened wide as their scarlet light fell on him where he tottered. \u0027I ... I CAN SEE... YOU!\u0027 said Thibor then, his risen voice as evil and alien as any of his mental sendings from the tomb. But the statement seemed in no way threatening; it was more as if the fact of sight - and in particular of seeing Dragosani - in some way brought to the creature a mixed measure of relief and disbelief. Whichever, the necromancer cringed back and down; but in that same moment: I \u0027Ho, Thing from the earth!\u0027 said Max Batu, steppingout from cover. \u0027\u0027 Thibor Ferenczy\u0027s head shot round on his neck in the direction of the Mongol\u0027s voice. Seeing Batu where he stood, his great dog\u0027s jaws fell open and he hissed from between teeth like blades of bone which dripped slime. And without pause Batu took one look at that face, then aimed and fired Ladislau Giresci\u0027s crossbow. The lignum vitae bolt was five-eighths of an inch thick and steel-tipped. It sprang from the weapon and plunged at almost point-blank range into and through the vam\u0026shy;pire\u0027s heaving chest, transfixing him. Thibor gave a hissing shriek and tried to draw himself back down into the steaming earth, but the bolt jammed in the sides of the hole and prevented him, tearing his grey flesh. He gave a second shriek then - a soul-wrenching thing to hear - and tossed himself to and fro with the bolt still in him, cursing and spewing out slime from his chomping, grimacing mouth. Batu loped quickly to Dragosani\u0027s side, supported him, handed him a full-sized sickle whose edge gleamed silver from a recent sharpening. The necromancer took it, shook Batu off, staggeringly advanced upon the struggling monster trapped half-in, half-out of its grave. \u0027The last time they buried you,\u0027 he gasped, \u0027they made one big mistake, Thibor Ferenczy.\u0027 And the muscles of is neck and arm bunched as he drew back the sickle. \u0027They left your fucking head on!\u0027 The monster tugged at the shaft in its chest, stared at Dragosani with a look beyond his comprehension. There was something of fear in it, yes, but more than this there was that baffled astonishment, as if the beast could not take in or understand this sudden reversal. \u0027WAIT!\u0027 it croaked as he drew close, the cracked bass sound of its voice like so many saplings snapping in an avalanche. \u0027CAN\u0027T YOU SEE? IT\u0027S ME!!!\u0027 But Dragosani didn\u0027t wait. He knew who and what the monster was, knew also that the only real way he could inherit its knowledge, its powers, was this way: as a necromancer. Yes, and such a wonderful irony in it, for Thibor himself had given him the gift! \u0027Die, you bastard Thing!\u0027 he snarled, and the sickle became a blur of steel as it sheared the monster\u0027s head from its trunk. The awful head sprang aloft, fell, bounced. And even rolling it cried, \u0027FOOL! DAMNED FOOL!\u0027 before lying still. Then the scarlet eyes closed. The mouth opened one last time and a gob of red-tinged filth shot out - and a final word, the merest whisper: \u0027Fool!\u0027 Dragosani\u0027s answer was to swing the sickle a second time, splitting the head in two parts like some great grey overripe melon. Inside the skull, the brain was a mush with a writhing core: in effect two brains, one human and shrivelled and the other - alien! The brain of the vampire. Without pause, without fear, knowing for once exactly what he did, Dragosani stuck his hands deep into the two halves of the skull cavity and let his trembling fingers feel the reeking fluids and pulp. All the secrets and the lore of the Wamphyri were here, here, just waiting for him to search them out. Yes! Yes! Even now the brains were rotting, falling into the natural decay and corruption of centuries... but Dragosani\u0027s necromantic talent was already tracking the undead (now utterly dead) monster\u0027s secrets through the very juices of its crumbling brain. Grey as stone, his eyes standing out obscenely in his head, he lifted up the mess to his face - but too late! Before his frantic eyes everything rotted away, boiled into smoke, trickled in streams of dust through his twitching fingers. Even the misshapen skull, dust in his hands. With a cry almost of anguish, wildly swinging his arms like a windmill run amok, Dragosani spun and made a headlong dive for the vampire\u0027s headless body where it still sat upright in its grave. The severed neck was beginning to steam away, settling into the scaled chest which itself slumped down into the unseen trunk below. And even as the necromancer plunged his hand and arm down into that hole, into the rot and the stench, so the earth belched up a great mushrooming cloud of poisonous vapour and collapsed in upon the now almost liquid corpse. Dragosani howled like a banshee and drew out his arm from the quag, then crawled away from the shuddering, belching hole as the ground quickly settled into quiescence. At the edge of the circle he paused, head hanging limply, shoulders slumped, and sobbed his frustration long and rackingly. Breathless, shaken to his roots by all he had seen, Max Batu watched the necromancer a little while longer then slowly came forward. He got down on one knee beside Dragosani and gripped his shoulder. \u0027Comrade Dragosani,\u0027 Batu\u0027s voice was hushed, little more than a dry, croaking whisper. \u0027Is it over?\u0027 Dragosani stopped sobbing. He let his head continue to hang down while he considered Batu\u0027s question: was it all over? It was all over for Thibor Ferenczy, yes, but only just beginning for the new vampire, the as yet immature creature which even now shared Dragosani\u0027s body with him. They would supply each other\u0027s needs,(however grudgingly,) learn from each other, become as one being. The question still remained as to whose will would eventually achieve dominance. Against any ordinary man the vampire must, of course, be the winner. Every time. But Dragosani was not ordinary. He had the power in him to accumulate his own lore, his own talents. And why not? Perhaps somewhere in his learning, in his gathering of secrets and strange new powers, he might yet find a way to be rid of the parasite. But until then... \u0027No, Max Batu,\u0027 he said, \u0027it\u0027s not over yet. Not for a while yet.\u0027 \"Then what must I do now?\u0027 the squat little Mongol was anxious to be of assistance. \u0027How can I help? What are your needs?\u0027 Dragosani continued to stare at the dark earth. How could Batu help? What were the necromancer\u0027s needs? Interesting questions. Pain and frustration died in Dragosani. There was much to do and time was wasting. He had come here to gather new powers to himself in the face of whatever threat was posed by Harry Keogh and the British E-Branch, and that was a job he still must do. Thibor\u0027s secrets were beyond him now, dead and gone forever like the vampire himself, but that must not be the end of the matter. However weak and battered he felt right now, still he knew that he had not been permanently dam aged. The pain may well have scarred his mind and soul (if he still had a soul), but those were scars which would heal. No, he had suffered no real or lasting injury. He had merely been - depleted. Depleted, yes. The thing inside him needed, and Dragosani knew what it needed. He felt Batu\u0027s hand on his shoulder and could almost hear the blood surging in the other\u0027s veins. Then Dragosani saw the sharp, curved surgical tool with which he would have slit the ewe\u0027s throat. It lay there close to his hand, silver against the black earth. Ah, well, he had intended this eventually. It would be so much sooner, that was all. Two things I need from you, Max,\u0027 Dragosani said,and looked up. Max Batu gasped aloud and his jaw fell open. Thenecromancer\u0027s eyes were scarlet as those of the fiend he had just killed! The Mongol saw them - saw something else that glittered silver in the night - and saw... nothing else. Ever... INTERVAL TWO: \u0027I have to stop,\u0027 Alec Kyle told his weird visitor. He put down his pencil, massaged his cramped wrist. The desk was littered with the curled shavings of five pencils, all of them whittled away to nothing. This was Kyle\u0027s sixth and his arm felt mangled from frantic scribbling. A thin sheaf of papers was stacked in front of Kyle, with pencilled notes and jottings covering each sheet top to bottom and margin to margin. When he had started to write all of this down (how long ago? Four and a half, five hours?) the notes had been fairly detailed. Within an hour they\u0027d become jottings, barely legible scrawl. Now even Kyle himself could scarcely read them, and they were reduced to a listing of dates alongside brief headlines. Now, for a moment resting his wrist and mind both, Kyle glanced at the dates again and shook his head. He still believed - instinctively knew - that all of this was the absolute truth, but there was one massively glaring anomaly here. An ambiguity he couldn\u0027t ignore. Kyle frowned, looked up at the apparition where it floated upright on the other side of the desk, blinked his eyes at this shimmering spectre of a man and said: \u0027There\u0027s something I don\u0027t quite understand.\u0027 Then he laughed, and not a little hysterically. \u0027I mean, there are a good many things here which I don\u0027t understand - but until now I\u0027ve at least believed them. This is harder to believe.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 said the apparition. Kyle nodded. Today\u0027s Monday,\u0027 he said. \u0027Sir Keenan is to be cremated tomorrow. The police have discovered nothing as yet and it seems almost blasphemous to keep his body, well, lying about in that condition.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 the other nodded his agreement. \u0027Well,\u0027 Kyle continued, \u0027the point is I know a lot of what you\u0027ve told me to be the truth, and I suspect that the rest of it is too. You\u0027ve told me things no one else outside myself and Sir Keenan should ever have known. But -\u0027 \u0027But?\u0027 \u0027But your story,\u0027 Kyle suddenly blurted, \u0027has already outstripped us! I\u0027ve been keeping a record of your time-scale and you\u0027ve just been telling me about the coming Wednesday, two days from now. According to you, Thibor Ferenczy isn\u0027t yet dead, won\u0027t be until Wednesday night!\u0027 After a moment the other said, \u0027I can see how that must appear strange to you, yes. Time is relative, Alec, the same as space. Indeed the two go hand in hand. I\u0027ll go further than that: everything is relative. There is a Grand Scheme to things Some of that escaped Kyle. For the moment he saw only what he wanted to see. \u0027You can read the future? That well?\u0027 His face was a mask of awe. \u0027And I thought I had a talent! But to be able to see the future so clearly is almost unbe-\u0027 and he stopped short and gasped. As if things weren\u0027t incredible enough, a new, even more incredible thought had crossed his mind. Perhaps his visitor saw it written in his face. At any rate he smiled a smile transparent as smoke from a cigarette, a smile that reflected not at all the light from the window but allowed it to pass right through. \u0027Is there something, Alec?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Where... where are you?\u0027 Kyle asked. \u0027I mean, where are you - the real, physical you - right now? Where are you speaking from? Or rather, when are you speaking from?\u0027 Time is relative,\u0027 the spectre said again, still smiling. \u0027You\u0027re speaking to me from the future, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 Kyle breathed. It was the only answer. It was the only way the spectre could know all of this, the only way he could do all of this. \u0027You\u0027ll be very useful to me,\u0027 said the other, slowly nodding. \u0027It seems you have a sharp intuitive ability to match your precognition, Alec Kyle. Or maybe it\u0027s all part of the same talent. But now, shall we continue?\u0027 Still gaping, Kyle again took up the pencil. \u0027I think you better had continue,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027You\u0027d better tell me all of it, right to the end...\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-necroscope-1/page-15.html","bookId":2436,"book":{"id":2436,"title":"Necroscope (Necroscope #1)","description":"Storyline: Harry is an English youth in school, and strange things occur as he grows up, such as a sudden increased intellect in mathematics, and the ability to fight beyond his experience after a teacher is killed.
