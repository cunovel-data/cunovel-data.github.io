{"id":78780,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"It was as Harry had suspected it would be: beyond the Mobius doors he discovered the Primal Darkness itself, that darkness which existed before the universe began. It was not only the absence of light but the absence of everything. He might be at the core of a black hole, except a black hole has enormous gravity and this place had none. In one sense it was a metaphysical plane of existence, but in another it was not - because nothing existed here. It was simply a \u0027place\u0027, but a place in which no God as yet had uttered those wonderful words of evocation, \u0027Let there be light!\u0027 It was nowhere, and it was everywhere; it was both central and external. From here one might go anywhere, or go nowhere for ever. And it would be for ever, for in this timeless environment nothing ever aged or changed, except by force of will. Harry Keogh was therefore a foreign body, an unwanted mote in the eye of the Mobius continuum, and it must try to reject him. He felt matter-less forces working on him even now, pushing at him and attempting to dislodge him from the unreal back into the real. Except he must not let himself be pushed. There were doors he could conjure, certainly, a million million doors leading to all places and all times, but he knew that most of these places and times would be totally lethal to him. No use, like Mobius, to emerge in some distant galaxy in deep space. Harry was not merely a creature of mind but also of matter. He had no desire to freeze, or fry, or melt, or explode. The problem, then, was this: which door? Harry\u0027s dive through Mobius\u0027 tombstone might have carried him a yard or a light-year, he might have been here for a minute or a month, when he felt the first tentative tug of a force other than the rejection forces of this hyperspace-time dimension. Not even a tug, as such, it was more a gentle pressure that seemed to want to guide him. He\u0027d known something like it before, when he\u0027d tracked his mother under the ice and come up in her pool beneath the overhanging bank. There seemed nothing of a threat in it, anyway. Harry went with it, following it and feeling it intensify, homing in on it as a blind man homes in on a friendly voice. Or a moth on the bright flame of a candle? No, for his intuition told him that whatever it was there was no harm in it. Stronger still the force bobbed him along this parallel space-time stream, and like seeing a light at the end of a tunnel, so he sensed the way ahead and began to will himself in that direction. \u0027Good!\u0027 said a distant voice in Harry\u0027s head. \u0027Very good. Come to me, Harry Keogh, come to me...\u0027 It was a female voice, but there was little of warmth in it. Thin, it keened like the wind in the Leipzig graveyard, and like the wind it was old as the ages. \u0027Who are you?\u0027 Harry asked. \u0027A friend,\u0027 came the answer, stronger now. Harry continued to will himself towards the mental voice. He willed himself... that way. And there before him, a Mobius door. He reached for it, paused. \u0027How do I know you\u0027re a friend? How do I know I can trust you?\u0027 \u0027I asked that same question once,\u0027 said the voice, almost in his ear. \u0027For I too had no way of knowing. But I trusted.\u0027 Harry willed the door open and passed through. Stretched out in his original dive, he found himself suspended maybe three inches above the ground, and fell - then clung to the earth and hugged himself to it. The voice in his head chuckled. \u0027There,\u0027 it said. \u0027You see? A friend...\u0027 Dizzy and feeling sick, Harry gradually withdrew his fingers from loose, dry soil. He lifted his head a fraction, stared all about. Light and colour struck almost physical blows on his reeling vision. Light and warmth. That was the first impression to really get through to him: how warm it was. The soil was warm under his prone body, the sun unseasonally warm where it shone on his neck and his hands. Where on God\u0027s earth was he? Was he on Earth at all? Slowly, still dizzy, he sat up. And gradually, as he felt gravity working on him, so things stopped revolving and he uttered a loud \u0027Phew!\u0027 of relief. Harry wasn\u0027t much travelled or he\u0027d have recognised the terrain at once as being Mediterranean. The soil was a yellowy-brown and streaked with sand, the plants were those of scrubland, the sun\u0027s warmth in January told of his proximity to the equator. Certainly he was thousands of miles closer to it here than he\u0027d been in Leipzig. In the distance a mountain range threw up low peaks; closer there were ruins, crumbling white walls and mounds of rubble; and overhead - A pair of jet fighter planes, like speeding silver darts against the pure blue of the sky, left vapour trails as they hastened towards the horizon. Their thunder rolled down over him, muted by distance. Harry breathed easier, looked again towards the ruins. Middle-Eastern? Probably. Just some ancient village fallen victim to Nature\u0027s grand reclamation scheme. And again he wondered where he was. \u0027Endor,\u0027 said the voice in his head. \u0027That was its name when it had a name. It was my home.\u0027 Endor? That rang a bell. The biblical Endor? The place where Saul went on the night before his death on the slopes of Gilboa? Where he went to seek out - a witch? \u0027That is what they called me, aye,\u0027 she chuckled dryly in his mind. \u0027The Witch of Endor. But that was long and long ago, and there have been witches and witches. Mine was a great talent, but now a greater one is come into the world. In my long sleep I heard of him, this mighty wizard, and such were the rumours that they awakened me. The dead call him their friend and there are those among the living who fear him greatly. Aye, and I desired to speak with this one, who is already a legend among the tomb-legions. And lo! - I called and he came to me. And his name is Harry Keogh...\u0027 Harry stared at the earth where he sat, put down his hands and pressed upon it. His hands came away dusty and dry. \u0027You\u0027re... here?\u0027 he said. \u0027I am one with the dust of the world,\u0027 she answered. \u0027My dust is here.\u0027 Harry nodded. Two thousand years is a long time. \u0027Why did you help me?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Would you have me damned for ever by all the teeming dead?\u0027 she answered at once. \u0027Why did I help you? Because they asked it of me! All of them! Your fame precedes you, Harry. \"Save this one!\" they begged me, \"for he is beloved of us.\u0027\" Again Harry nodded. \u0027My mother,\u0027 he said. \u0027Your mother is but one,\u0027 answered the witch. \u0027She is your chief advocate, certainly, but the dead are many. She pleaded for you, aye, and many a thousand with her.\u0027 Harry was astonished. \u0027I don\u0027t know thousands,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know a dozen, two dozen at most.\u0027 Again her chuckle, long, dry and mirthless. \u0027But they know you! And how may I ignore my brothers and sisters in the earth?\u0027 \u0027You wish to help me?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Do you know what I have to do?\u0027 \u0027Others have informed me, aye.\u0027 \u0027Then give me whatever aid you can - if you can. Frankly, and while I don\u0027t wish to seem ungrateful, I don\u0027t see how there\u0027s a lot you can do.\u0027 \u0027Oh? But I controlled some of these same powers you control two thousand years ago. And are my arts forgotten? A king came to me for help, Harry Keogh!\u0027 \u0027Saul? Little good it did him,\u0027 said Harry, but not unkindly. \u0027He asked me to show him his future,\u0027 she answered defensively, \u0027and I showed him.\u0027 \u0027And can you show me mine?\u0027 \u0027Your future?\u0027 she was silent for a moment. Then: \u0027I have already looked upon your future, Harry, but of that ask me not.\u0027 \u0027That bad, eh?\u0027 \u0027There are deeds to be performed,\u0027 she answered, \u0027and wrongs to be righted. If I were to show you what will be, it would not make you strong for the task ahead. Like Saul, perhaps you too would faint away upon the earth.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m going to lose...\u0027 Harry\u0027s heart sank. \u0027Something of you shall be lost.\u0027 Harry shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t like the sound of that. Can\u0027t you say more?\u0027 \u0027I will not say more.\u0027 \u0027Then perhaps you\u0027ll help me with the Mobius dimen\u0026shy;sion. I mean, how may I find my way about in it? I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d have done if you hadn\u0027t guided me out of there.\u0027 \u0027But I know nothing of this thing,\u0027 she answered, obviously puzzled. \u0027I called to you and you heard me. Why not let them also guide you who love you?\u0027 Was that possible? Harry thought it probably was. \u0027At least that\u0027s something,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can give it a try. Now, how else can you help me?\u0027 \u0027For Saul the king,\u0027 she answered, \u0027I called up Samuel. Now there are also some who would speak to you. Let me be the medium of their messages.\u0027 \u0027But it\u0027s self-evident I can speak to the dead for myself!\u0027 he said. \u0027But not to these three,\u0027 she answered, \u0027for you know them not.\u0027 \u0027Very well, let me speak to them.\u0027 \u0027Harry Keogh,\u0027 a new voice now whispered in his head, a soft voice that belied the once-cruelty of its master. \u0027I saw you one time and you saw me. My name is Max Batu.\u0027 Harry gasped, spat his disgust on to the sand. \u0027Max Batu? You\u0027re no friend of mine,\u0027 he scowled. \u0027You killed Keenan Gormley!\u0027 Then he thought about who he was speaking to. \u0027But you? Dead? I don\u0027t understand.\u0027 \u0027Dragosani killed me,\u0027 the other told him. \u0027He did it to steal my talent with his necromancy. He slit my throat and gutted me, and left my body to rot. Now he has the evil eye. I make no pretence of being your friend, Harry Keogh, but I\u0027m much less a friend of his. I tell you this because it might help you to kill him - before he kills you. It is my revenge!\u0027 And as Max Batu\u0027s voice faded, another took its place: \u0027I was Thibor Ferenczy,\u0027 it said, its timbre sad and soulful. \u0027I could have lived for ever. I was a vampire, Harry Keogh, but Dragosani destroyed me. I was undead; now I am merely dead.\u0027 A vampire! Just such a creature had cropped up in Gormley\u0027s and Kyle\u0027s word-association game. Kyle had seen a vampire in Harry\u0027s future. But: \u0027I can hardly condemn Dragosani for killing a vampire!\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t want you to condemn him,\u0027 the voice grew harsh in a moment, shedding its sorrow like a worn-out snakeskin. \u0027I want you to kill him! I want the lying, cheating, illegitimate necromantic dog dead, dead, dead! - like me! And I know he will be dead -1 know you will kill him - but only with my help. Only if you\u0027ll... bargain with me?\u0027 \u0027Do not, Harry!\u0027 the Witch of Endor warned him. \u0027Satan himself is no match for a vampire where lies and deceit are concerned.\u0027 \u0027No bargains,\u0027 Harry took her point. \u0027But it is such a small thing I want!\u0027 Thibor protested, his mental voice growing into a whine. \u0027How small?\u0027 \u0027Only promise me that now and then - once in a while, be it ever so long - when you have the time, then that you\u0027ll speak to me. For there are none so lonely as I am now, Harry Keogh.\u0027 \u0027Very well. I promise.\u0027 The ex-vampire sighed his relief. \u0027Good! And now I know why the dead love you. Now know this, Harry: Dragosani has a vampire in him! The creature is still immature, but it grows fast and learns even faster. And do you know how to kill a vampire?\u0027 \u0027A wooden stake?\u0027 \u0027That is only to pin him down. But then you must behead him!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll remember that,\u0027 Harry nodded, nervously licking dry lips. \u0027And remember too your promise,\u0027 said Thibor, his voice fading into nothing. For a moment then it was silent and Harry was left to think about the awesome nature of this composite creature he\u0027d pitted himself against; but then, out of the silence, he heard the voice of the third and last informer: \u0027Harry Keogh,\u0027 growled this final visitation, \u0027you don\u0027t know me, but Sir Keenan Gormley may have told you something of me. I was Gregor Borowitz. Now I am no more. Dragosani killed me with Max Batu\u0027s evil eye. I am dead in my prime, by treachery!\u0027 \u0027So you too seek revenge,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Had he no friends, this Dragosani? Not even one?\u0027 \u0027Yes, he had me. I had plans for Dragosani, great plans. Ah, but the bastard had plans of his own! And I wasn\u0027t part of them. He killed me for my knowledge of E-Branch, so that he can control what I created. But it goes farther than that. I think he wants - everything! I mean literally everything under the sun. And if he lives he might very well get everything, eventually.\u0027 \u0027\"Eventually?\"\u0027 There came a great mental shudder from Borowitz. \u0027You see, he\u0027s not finished with me yet. My body lies in my dacha where he left it, but sooner or later it will be delivered into his hands, and then he\u0027ll deal with me as he dealt with Max Batu. I don\u0027t want that, Harry. I don\u0027t want that scum wading through my guts in search of my secrets!\u0027 Something of his horror .transmitted itself to Harry, but still the necroscope could feel no pity for him. \u0027I under\u0026shy;stand your motivation,\u0027 he said, \u0027but if he hadn\u0027t killed you I would have. If I could. For my mother, for Keenan Gormley, for everyone you\u0027ve hurt or would hurt.\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes, of course you would,\u0027 said Borowitz without enmity, \u0027if you could. I was a soldier before I was a schemer, Harry Keogh. I understand honour even if Dragosani doesn\u0027t. It\u0027s because of all these things that I want to help you.\u0027 \u0027I accept your reasons,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027How can you help me?\u0027 \u0027First I can tell you all I know about the Chateau Bronnitsy: its design and layout, the people who work there. Here, take it all,\u0027 and he quickly imparted to Harry all knowledge of the place and of the ESPers who worked there. \u0027And then I can tell you something else, something which you, with your special talent, can use to good advantage. I\u0027ve said I was first a soldier. So I was, and my knowledge of warfare was second to none. I had studied the entire history of warfare from Man\u0027s begin\u0026shy;nings. I had traced his wars right across the face of the planet, and knew all the old battlefields intimately. You ask how I can help you? Well listen and I\u0027ll tell you.\u0027 Harry listened, and slowly his strange eyes opened wider and a grim smile spread itself across his face. He had been weary until now, burdened. But now a massive weight was lifted from his shoulders. He did have a chance, after all. Finally Borowitz was finished. \u0027Well, we were enemies,\u0027 said Harry then, \u0027even though we never met in the flesh. But I thank you anyway. You know of course that I intend to destroy your organisation as well as Dragosani?\u0027 \u0027No more than he\u0027d destroy it,\u0027 the other growled. \u0027Anyway, I have to go now. There\u0027s someone else I want to find, if I can...\u0027 And his voice, too, faded into silence. Harry looked at the rugged terrain all around and saw how the sun dipped lower in the sky. Dust devils raced along a ridge. Kites wheeled in the sky as the day turned towards evening. And for a long while, as the shadows lengthened, he sat there on the sand and pebbles with his chin in his hands, just thinking. At last he said, \u0027They all want to help me.\u0027 \u0027Because you bring them hope,\u0027 the Witch of Endor told him. \u0027For centuries, indeed since time itself began, the dead have lain still in their graves and that was that. But now they stir, they seek each other out, they talk to each other in a manner you have taught them. They have found a champion. Only ask of them, Harry Keogh, and they will obey...\u0027 Harry stood up, gazed all around, felt the chill of evening beginning to creep. \u0027I see no reason to stay here any longer,\u0027 he said. \u0027As for you, old lady: I don\u0027t know how to thank you.\u0027 \u0027I have all the thanks I want,\u0027 she answered. The teeming dead thank me.\u0027 He nodded. \u0027Yes, and there are some of them I want to speak to-first.\u0027 \u0027Go then,\u0027 she answered. \u0027The future waits for you as it waits for all men.\u0027 Harry said no more but conjured the Mobius doors, chose one and walked through it. He went first to his mother, finding his way to her without difficulty; then to \u0027Sergeant\u0027 Graham Lane at Harden, including a quick jump of only fifty yards or so to the grave of James Gordon Hannant; then to a Garden of Repose in Kensington, where Keenan Gormley\u0027s ashes had been scattered, but where Gormley himself remained; and finally to Gregor Borowitz\u0027s dacha in Zhukovka. He spent perhaps ten to fifteen minutes in each location with the exception of the last. It was one thing to talk to dead men in their graves but quite another to talk to one who sat there and looked at you with glassy, pus-dripping eyes. In any case, by the time Harry was through he was satisfied that he knew his business, that he could now safely negotiate the intricacies of the Mobius continuum; and by then there was only one place left to go. But first he took down a double-barrelled shotgun from the wall and filled his pockets with cartridges from a drawer. It was just 6:30 p.m. East European time when he started to ride the Mobius strip from Zhukovka to the Chateau Bronnitsy. Along the way he became aware that someone rode the strip with him, knew he wasn\u0027t alone in the Mobius continuum. \u0027Who\u0027s there?\u0027 he called out with his mind in the ultimate darkness of the journey. \u0027Just another dead man,\u0027 came the answer, but in a voice wry and humourless. \u0027In my life I read the future, but I had to die to understand and finally realise the full extent of my talent. Strangely, in your \"now\" I am still alive, but I shall be dead shortly.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027I didn\u0027t expect you to understand immediately. I\u0027m here to explain. My name is Igor Vlady. I worked for Borowitz. I made the mistake of reading my own future, my own death. That will happen two days from your \"now\", as a result of Boris Dragosani\u0027s ordering it. But after death I will go on to explore my own potential. What I did in life I will do even better in death. If I wanted to I could see backward to the beginning of time, or go forward to its end - if time had a beginning and an end. But of course it has not; it is all a part of the Mobius continuum, an endlessly twisting loop containing all space and time. Let me show you:\u0027 And he showed Harry the doors into the future and the past, and Harry stood on their thresholds and viewed time that had been and time still to come; except that he could not understand what he saw. For beyond the future-time door all was a chaos of millions of lines of blue light, and one of these streamed from his own being out through the door and into the future - his future. Likewise beyond the past-time door: the same blue light pouring out of him and fading into the past - his past - along with the light of countless millions of others. And such was the dazzling blue brilliance of all those life-threads that he was almost blinded by it. \u0027But no light shines from you,\u0027 he said to Igor Vlady. \u0027Why is that?\u0027 \u0027Because my light has been extinguished. Now I am like Mobius: pure mind. And where space holds no secrets for him, time holds none for me.\u0027 Harry thought about it, said: \u0027I want to see my life-thread again.\u0027 And again he stood on the threshold of the door to the future. He looked into the bright blue furnace of the future and saw his life-thread shimmering into it like a neon ribbon, and he could see it clearly where it curved away into future time. But even as he watched, so the end of his thread of life came into view; and then it seemed to him that the blue life-light of his body was not flowing out of him but flowing in! The thread was being eaten up by him as he approached his own end! And now that end was plainly visible, speeding towards him like a meteor out of the future! Quickly, in terror of the Unknown, he stepped back from the door and once more into darkness. \u0027Am I going to die?\u0027 he asked then. \u0027Is that what you\u0027re telling me, showing me?\u0027 \u0027Yes - \u0027 said the time-travelling mind of Igor Vlady \u0027 -and no.\u0027 Again Harry failed to understand. \u0027I\u0027m about to pass through a Mobius door to the Chateau Bronnitsy,\u0027 he said. \u0027If I\u0027m going to die there I\u0027d like to know it. The Witch of Endor told me that I would lose \"something\" of myself. Now I\u0027ve seen the end of my life-thread.\u0027 He gave a nervous mental shrug. \u0027It seems I\u0027m coming to the end of my tether...\u0027 In answer he sensed a nod. \u0027But if you were to use the future-time door,\u0027 said Vlady, \u0027you could go on beyond the end of your thread - to where it begins again!\u0027 \u0027Begins again?\u0027 Harry was baffled. \u0027Are you saying I\u0027m to live again?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s a second thread which is also you, Harry. It lives even now. All it lacks is mind.\u0027 And Vlady explained his meaning; he read Harry\u0027s future for him, just as he once read Boris Dragosani\u0027s. Except that where Harry had a future, Dragosani had only a past. And now, at last, Harry had all the answers. \u0027I owe you my thanks,\u0027 he told Vlady then. \u0027You owe me nothing,\u0027 said Vlady. \u0027But you came to me just in time,\u0027 Harry insisted, little realising the significance of his words. \u0027Time is relative,\u0027 the other shrugged, and chuckled. \u0027What will be, has been!\u0027 \u0027Thanks, anyway,\u0027 said Harry, and passed through the door to the Chateau Bronnitsy. At 6:31 p.m. exactly, Dragosani\u0027s telephone came janglingly alive, causing him to start. Outside it was dark now, made darker by snow falling heavily from a black sky. Searchlights in the Chateau\u0027s outer walls and towers swept the ground between the complex itself and the perimeter wall, as they had swept it since the fall of dark, but now their beams were reduced to mere swaths of grey light whose poor penetration was of little or no consequence, Dragosani found it annoying that vision should be so reduced, but the Chateau\u0027s defences had more going for them than human eyesight alone; there were sensitive tripwires out there, the latest electronic detection devices, even a belt of anti-personnel mines in a circle just beyond the outbuilding pill-boxes. None of which gave Dragosani any real sensation of security; Igor Vlady\u0027s predictions had ignored all such protections. In any case, the call did not come from the pill-boxes or the fortified perimeter: the men in their defensive positions were all equipped with hand radios. This call was either external or it came from a department within the Chateau itself. Dragosani snatched the handset from its cradle, snapped, \u0027Yes, what is it?\u0027 \u0027Felix Krakovitch,\u0027 a trembling voice answered. \u0027I\u0027m down in my lab. Comrade Dragosani, there\u0027s... some\u0026shy;thing!\u0027 Dragosani knew the man: a seer, a minor prognosticator. His talent wasn\u0027t up to Vlady\u0027s standard by a long shot, but neither was it to be ignored - not on this of all nights. \u0027Something?\u0027 Dragosani\u0027s nostrils flared. The man had put an eerie emphasis on the word. \u0027Make sense, Krakovitch! What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know, Comrade. It\u0027s just that... something\u0027s coming. Something terrible. No, it\u0027s here. It\u0027s here now!\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s \"here\"?\u0027 Dragosani snarled into the phone. \u0027Where, \"here\"?\u0027 \u0027Out there, in the snow. Belov feels it, too.\u0027 \u0027Belov?\u0027 Karl Belov was a telepath, and a good one over short distances. Borowitz had often used him at foreign embassy parties, picking up what he could from the minds of his hosts. \u0027Is Belov there with you now? Put him on.\u0027 Belov was asthmatic. His voice was always soft and gasping, his sentences invariably short. Right now they were even more so: \u0027He\u0027s right, Comrade,\u0027 he gasped. \u0027There\u0027s a mind out there - a powerful mind!\u0027 Keogh! It had to be him. \u0027Just one?\u0027 Dragosani\u0027s once-sensitive lips curled back from a mouthful of white daggers. His red eyes seemed to light from within. How Keogh had come here he couldn\u0027t say, but if he was alone he was a dead man - and to hell with that traitor Vlady\u0027s predictions! On the other end of the line, Belov fought for air, struggled to find a means of expression. \u0027Well?\u0027 Dragosani hastened him. \u0027I ... I\u0027m not sure,\u0027 said Belov. \u0027I thought there was only one, but now -\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 Dragosani almost shouted. \u0027Damn it all! - am I surrounded by idiots? What is it, Belov? What\u0027s out there?\u0027 Belov panted into the phone at his end, gasped, \u0027He\u0027s... calling. He\u0027s some sort of telepath himself, and he\u0027s calling.\u0027 To you?\u0027 Dragosani\u0027s brows knitted in baffled frus\u0026shy;tration. His great nostrils sniffed suspiciously, anxiously, as if to draw the answer from the air itself. \u0027No, not to me. He\u0027s calling to ... to others. Oh, God - and they\u0027re beginning to answer him!\u0027 \u0027Who is answering him?\u0027 Dragosani barked. \u0027What\u0027s wrong with you, Belov? Are there traitors? Here in the Chateau.\u0027 There came a clattering from the other end - a low moan and a thudding sound - then Krakovitch again: \u0027He has fainted, Comrade!\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 Dragosani couldn\u0027t believe his ears. \u0027Belov, fainted? What the hell-?\u0027 Lights were beginning to flicker on the call-sign panel of the radio Dragosani had had moved in here from the DO\u0027s control cell. A number of men with handsets were trying to contact him from their defensive positions. Next door Borowitz\u0027s secretary, Yul Galenski, sat nervously behind his desk, twitching as he listened to Dragosani\u0027s raging. And now the necromancer started bellowing for him: \u0027Galenski, are you deaf? Get in here. I need assistance!\u0027 At that moment the DO burst in from the landing in the central stairwell. He carried weapons: stubby Kalashnikov machine-pistols. As Galenski started to his feet he said: \u0027You sit there. I\u0027ll go in.\u0027 Without pause for knocking he almost ran into the other room, pulled up short, gasping, as he saw Dragosani crouched over the radio\u0027s panel of blinking lights. Drago\u0026shy;sani had taken his glasses off. Snarling soundlessly at the radio, he seemed more like some hunched, half-crazy beast than a man. Still staring in astonishment at the necromancer\u0027s face, his awful eyes, the DO dumped an armful of weapons onto a chair; as he did so, Dragosani said: \u0027Stop gawping!\u0027 He reached out a great hand and grabbed the DO\u0027s shoulder, dragged him effortlessly towards the radio. \u0027Do you know how to operate this damned thing?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Dragosani,\u0027 the DO gulped, finding his voice. \u0027They are trying to speak to you.\u0027 \u0027I can see that, fool!\u0027 Dragosani snapped. \u0027Well then, speak to them. Find out what they want.\u0027 The DO perched himself on the edge of a steel chair in front of the radio. He took up the handset, flipped switches, said: \u0027This is Zero. All call-signs acknowledge, over?\u0027 The replies came in sharp, numerical succession: \u0027Call-sign One, OK, over.\u0027 Two, OK, over.\u0027 \u0027Three, OK, over.\u0027 And so on rapidly through fifteen call-signs. The voices were tinny and there was some static, but over and above that they all seemed a little too shrill, all contained a ragged edge of barely controlled panic. \u0027Zero for call-sign One, send your message, over,\u0027 said the DO. \u0027One: there are things out in the snow!\u0027 the answer came back at once, One\u0027s voice crackling with static and mounting excitement. \u0027They\u0027re closing on my position! Request permission to open fire, over?\u0027 \u0027Zero for One: wait, out!\u0027 snapped the DO. He looked at Dragosani. The necromancer\u0027s red eyes were open wide, like clots of blood frozen in his inhuman face. \u0027No!\u0027 he snarled. \u0027First I want to know what we\u0027re dealing with. Tell him to hold his fire and give me a running commentary.\u0027 White-faced, the DO nodded, passed on Dragosani\u0027s order, was glad that he wasn\u0027t stuck out there in a pill\u0026shy;box in the snow - but on the other hand, could that be any worse than being stuck in here with the madman Dragosani? \u0027Zero, this is One!\u0027 One\u0027s voice crackled out of the radio, almost hysterical with excitement now. \u0027They\u0027re coming in a semicircle out of the snow. In a minute they\u0027ll hit the mines. But they move so ... so slowly! There! One of them stepped on a mine! It blew him to bits - but the others keep coming! They\u0027re thin, ragged -they don\u0027t make any noise. Some of them have - swords?\u0027 \u0027Zero for One: you keep calling them \"things\". Aren\u0027t they men?\u0027 One\u0027s radio procedure went out of the window. \u0027Men?\u0027 his voice was completely hysterical. \u0027Maybe they are men, or were - once. I think I\u0027m insane! This is unbelievable!\u0027 He tried to get a grip on himself. \u0027Zero, I\u0027m alone here and there are ... many of them. I request permission to open fire. I beg you! I must protect myself...\u0027 A white foam began to gather at the corners of Dragosani\u0027s gaping mouth where he stared at a wall-chart, checking One\u0027s location. It was an outbuilding pill-box directly below the command tower but fifty yards out from the Chateau itself. Occasionally as the snow swirled he could see its low, squat dark outline through the bullet-proof bay windows, but as yet no sign of the unknown invaders. He stared out into the snow again, and at that precise moment saw a blaze of orange fire erupt to throw the outbuilding into brief silhouette - and this time there came a low crump of an explosion as another mine was tripped. The DO looked to him for instructions. Tell him to describe these... things!\u0027 Dragosani snapped. Before the DO could obey, another call-sign came up unbidden: \u0027Zero, this is Eleven. Fuck One! These bas\u0026shy;tards are all over the place! If we don\u0027t open fire now they\u0027ll be crawling all over us. You want to know what they are? I\u0027ll tell you: they\u0027re dead men!\u0027 That was it. It was what Dragosani had feared. Keogh was here, definitely, and he was calling up the dead! But where from? Tell them to fire at will,\u0027 he coughed the words out in a spray of froth. Tell them to cut the bastards down -whatever they are!\u0027 The DO passed on his orders. But already, from every quarter, dull explosions were beginning to pound all around the Chateau; the harsh clatter of machine-gun fire, too. The defenders had finally used their own initiat\u0026shy;ive, had commenced firing almost point-blank on a zombie army that came marching inexorably through the snow. Gregor Borowitz had not lied. He had indeed known his History of Warfare, and especially in his native land. In 1579 Moscow had been sacked by Tartars from the Crimea; there had been arguments about the division of the loot from the city; a would-be Khan had challenged the authority of his superiors; he and his splinter-group of three hundred horsemen had then been stripped of loot, rank, most of their weapons and whipped out of the city. Disgraced and scavenging where they could, they had ridden south. It had rained heavily and they had bogged down in a marshy triangle of forest where rivers overflowed their banks. There a five-hundred-strong Rus\u0026shy;sian force riding to the relief of the beleaguered city had come across them in the mist and rain and cut them down to a man. Their bodies had gone down in mud and mire, never to be seen again - until now. Nor had they needed much persuasion from Harry; indeed they\u0027d seemed merely to be waiting for him, ready at a moment\u0027s notice to fight their way free of the bitter earth where they had lain for four hundred years. Bone by bone, tatter by leathery tatter they had come up, some of them still bearing the rusted arms of yesteryear, and at Harry\u0027s command they\u0027d moved on the Chateau Bronnitsy. Harry had stepped out of the Mobius continuum inside the perimeter walls; the defenders of those walls, gazing outward, hadn\u0027t even seen him or the agonising emerg\u0026shy;ence of his long-dead army. Moreover, the machine-gun emplacements on the outer walls were pointing the wrong way; which all combined with the night and the snow to give him excellent cover. But then there had been the tripwires and other intruder detection devices, and now there was the minefield and the inner ring of disguised pill-boxes. For Harry none of these obstacles was any great prob\u0026shy;lem: they weren\u0027t even obstacles when at will he could simply step out of this universe and back into it a moment later in any room in the Chateau where he chose to reappear. But first he wanted to see how his back-up force was making out: he wanted the Chateau\u0027s defenders fully engaged in the business of protecting their own lives, not the life of Boris Dragosani. At the moment he was down on his belly in a shallow depression, huddled behind a headless bone-and-leather thing which a moment ago had marched ahead of him towards the pill-box outbuilding where call-sign One and his machine-gunner second in command sat and gibbered through their viewing slits, firing long bursts into the wall of death which slowly bore down on them. A large percentage of Harry\u0027s army - about half of his three hundred - had emerged from the earth in this sector, and the mines were quickly taking an unfair toll of them. Even now the pill-box and its chattering gun were dealing Harry\u0027s army terrific blows. He decided to take out the pill-box, broke open Gregor Borowitz\u0027s shotgun and slipped cartridges into the double breach. Take me with you,\u0027 begged the Tartar who shielded him. \u0027I helped sack a city once, and this is but a palace.\u0027 His skull head had been taken off by shrapnel from a landmine, but that hadn\u0027t seemed to matter much. He still held up a massive, battered iron and bronze shield, its rim dug into the cold earth, upright in the snow, using his own bones and the shield to give Harry as much cover as possible. \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry, shaking his head. \u0027There won\u0027t be much room in there and I\u0027ll need to get in and get it over with. But I\u0027d be obliged for the use of your shield.\u0027 Take it,\u0027 said the corpse, releasing the heavy plate from fingers of crusted bone. \u0027I hope it serves you well.\u0027 A mine went off somewhere to the right, its flash turning the falling snow orange for a moment and its thunder shaking the earth. In the momentary burst of light, Harry had seen an arc of skeletal figures stumbling ever closer to the dark huddled shape of the pill-box; so had the men inside. Armour-piercing machine-gun bullets screamed in the air, blowing apart Tartar remains and coming dangerously close. For all that Harry\u0027s ancient shield was heavy, still it was rotten with rust and decay; he knew it wouldn\u0027t stop a direct hit. \u0027Go now!\u0027 urged the dead thing where it struggled to its bony feet and lurched forward headlessly. \u0027Kill some of them for me.\u0027 Harry narrowed his eyes one last time through flurries of snow and fixed the location of the fire-spewing out\u0026shy;building in his mind, then rolled sideways through a Mobius door - and into the pill-box. No time for thinking in there, and little or no room for movement. What had looked from outside like an old cowshed was in fact a cramped nest of steel plates and concrete blocks, slate-grey gunmetal and shining ammunition-belts. Grey light fought its way in through arc-of-fire and viewing slits, turning the cordite and sweat-smelling interior to a drifting smog in which call-sign One and his second in command coughed and spluttered where they worked furiously and feverishly. Harry emerged in the tight space behind them, drop\u0026shy;ping his shield to the concrete floor as he swung up the loaded shotgun. Hearing the clatter as the shield fell, both Russians turned in their steel-backed swivel chairs. They saw a white-faced youth in an overcoat cradling a shotgun, his eyes bright points of light above pinched nostrils and the grim, tight line of his mouth. \u0027Who - ?\u0027 gasped One. He looked like some strange, startled, waspish alien in his Chateau uniform, with his headset for antennae above goggling eyes. \u0027How - ?\u0027 said his second in command, his fingers automatically completing the task of fitting a new belt to the machine-gun. Then call-sign One was scrabbling to snatch a pistol from his holster, and his second in command was coming to his feet, cursing. Harry felt no pity for them. It was them or him. And there were plenty of others just like them to welcome them where they were going. He pulled the triggers: one for One, two for his second in command, and blew them screaming into the arms of death. The stench of hot blood quickly mingled with acrid cordite and the reek of sweat and fear, causing Harry\u0027s eyes to water. He blinked them furiously, broke open the shotgun and reloaded, found another Mobius door. The next pill-box was the same, and the one after that. Six of them in all, they were all the same. Harry took them out in less than two minutes. In the last one, when it was done he found the chaotic mind of one of the fresh dead defenders and calmed him. \u0027It\u0027s over for you now,\u0027 he said, \u0027but the one who brought all this about is still alive. You\u0027d be home with your family tonight if not for him. And so would I. Now, where\u0027s Dragosani?\u0027 \u0027In Borowitz\u0027s office, in the tower,\u0027 said the other. \u0027He\u0027s turned it into the control room. There\u0027ll be others with him.\u0027 \u0027I expect there will,\u0027 said Harry, staring into the Rus\u0026shy;sian\u0027s shattered, smoking, unrecognisable face. \u0027Thanks.\u0027 And then there was only one thing left to do, but Harry fancied he\u0027d need a little help to do it. He snapped open the clamps that held the machine-gun in place on its swivelling base, took up the heavy gun and hurled it down to the hard floor, then lifted it and threw it down again. After being dashed to the concrete three or four times the hard wooden stock splintered lengthwise, allowing Harry to break off a jagged stake with a flat base and a sharp, hardwood point. He reached for his cartridges and found only one left, gritted his teeth and loaded the single cartridge into his shotgun. It would have to be enough. Then he pulled open the pill-box door and stepped out into the swirling snow. In the near distance, softened by night and the fast-falling snow, the Chateau blazed with light, its searchlight beams cutting to and fro as they searched for targets. Most of Harry\u0027s army - what remained of it - was already at the walls of the Chateau itself, however, from which the staccato yammering of machine-guns now sounded unceasingly. The remaining defenders were trying to kill dead men, and they were finding it hard. Harry looked about, saw a group of latecomers leaning into the snow as they plodded towards the beleaguered building. Eerie figures they were, gaunt scarecrow men, creaking past him in monstrous animation. But death held no fears for Harry Keogh. He stopped two of them, a pair of mummied cadavers a little less ravaged than the rest, and offered one the hardwood stake. \u0027For Dragosani,\u0027 he said. The other Tartar carried a great curving sword all scabbed with rust; Harry reckoned he\u0027d used it in his day to devastating effect. Well, and now - with any justice -he\u0027d use it again. He pointed to the sword, nodded, said: \u0027That, too, is for Dragosani - for the vampire in him.\u0027 Then he opened a Mobius door, and guiding his two sere companions stepped through it. Inside the Chateau Bronnitsy it had been all hell let loose almost from the beginning. The place had been built two hundred and thirty years ago on an ancient battlefield; the building itself was a mausoleum for a dozen of the fiercest of all the Tartar warriors. And its protection had kept the peaty ground pliant, so that the bodies which had lain there were more truly mummies than fleshless corpses. Also, Dragosani had ordered the great stone flags in the cellars lifted and floorboards ripped out in his search for signs of sabotage; and so, at Harry Keogh\u0027s first call, there had been little to deter these re-animated Tartars as they\u0027d struggled up from their centuried graves to answer his command and prowl the Chateau\u0027s corridors, laboratories and conservatories. And wherever they found ESPers or defenders, they had simply put them down out of hand. Now all that remained were the fortified machine-gun positions in the Chateau\u0027s own walls, which allowed the men within them no egress, no means of escape. The machine-gun posts could only be entered from within the Chateau; there were no exterior doors, no way out. The voice of one such call-sign trapped in his fortified position told Dragosani the entire story in every gory detail where he raged and frothed in his tower control room: \u0027Comrade, this is madness, madness!\u0027 the voice moaned over Dragosani\u0027s control radio, blocking all other traffic -if any remained to be blocked! \u0027They are... zombies, dead men! And how may we kill dead men? They come -and my gunner cuts them down and shoots them to pieces - and then the pieces come! Outside, a pile of pieces wriggles and kicks and builds itself into a wall against the wall of the Chateau. Trunks, legs, arms, hands - even the smaller pieces and the naked bones themselves! Soon they will pour in through the gun slits, and what then?\u0027 Dragosani snarled, more animal now than ever, and shook his fists at the night and the drifting snow beyond the tower\u0027s windows. \u0027Keogh!\u0027 he raged. \u0027I know you\u0027re there, Keogh. So come if you\u0027re coming and let\u0027s be done with it.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re inside the Chateau, too!\u0027 the voice on the radio sobbed. \u0027We\u0027re trapped in here. My gunner is a madman now. He raves even as he works his gun. I\u0027ve jammed the steel door shut but something continues to batter at it, trying to get in. I know what it is, for I saw it; it stuck a leathery claw inside before I could slam the door on its wrist; now the hand - oh God, the hand! -claws at my legs and tries to climb. I kick it away but it always returns. See, see? Again! Again!\u0027 And his voice tapered off into static and a crackling peal of laughter. Simultaneous with the idiot sounds from the radio, suddenly Yul Galenski cried out in terror from his ante\u0026shy;room office. \u0027The stairs! They\u0027re coming up the stairs!\u0027 His voice was shrill as a girl\u0027s; he had no experience of fighting; he was a clerk, a secretary. And in any case, who had experience of such as this? The DO had been standing at the window, white-faced, trembling; but now he snatched up a machine-pistol and rushed through to Galenski where he backed away from the outer door to the landing. On his way he grabbed blast grenades from Dragosani\u0027s desk. At least he is a man! thought Dragosani, grudgingly. Then came the DO\u0027s yelp of horror, his cursing, the chatter of his machine-pistol, finally the tearing explosion of grenades where he armed them and dropped them down the stairwell. And coming immediately after the thunder of the explosives, the last message from the unknown call-sign: \u0027No! No! Mother in heaven! My gunner has shot himself and now they\u0027re coming through the gun slits! Hands without arms! Heads without bodies! I think I shall have to follow my gunner, for he is out of all this now. But these... remains! They crawl among the grenades! No -stop that!\u0027 There came the distinct ch-ching of a grenade armed, more screaming and gibbering and sounds of chaos, and finally a massive burst of static following which - nothing. The radio sat and hissed background static at itself. And suddenly the Chateau Bronnitsy seemed very quiet... It was a quiet which couldn\u0027t last. As the DO backed into Galenski\u0027s office from the landing, where smoke and cordite stench curled up acridly from below, so Harry Keogh and his Tartar companions emerged from the Mobius continuum. They were there, in the anteroom, as if someone had suddenly switched them on. The DO heard Galenski\u0027s wail of abject terror and disbelief, whirled in a half-circle - and saw what Galenski had seen: a grim, smoke-grimed young man flanked by menacing mummy-things of black leather and gleaming white bone. The sight of them alone - right here, in this room with him - was almost sufficient to freeze him, unman him. But not quite. Life was dear. Lips drawn back in a rictus of desperation and fear, the DO gurgled something meaningless and swung up his machine-pistol... only to be lifted off his feet and thrown back out onto the landing, his face turning to raw pulp as Harry discharged his last cartridge at point-blank range. In another moment Harry\u0027s companions had turned their attention to Galenski where he gibbered and gro\u0026shy;velled in a corner behind his desk, and Harry had stepped through into what was once Gregor Borowitz\u0027s inner sanctum. Dragosani, in the act of hurling the extinct radio from its table, turned and saw him. His great jaws gaped his surprise; pointing an unsteady hand, he hissed like a snake, his red eyes blazing. And for the merest moment the two faced each other. There had been dramatic changes in both men, but in Dragosani the differences could only be likened to a complete metamorphosis. Harry recognised him, yes, but in any other situation he could hardly have known him. As for Harry himself: little of his former personality or identity remained. He had inherited a great sum of talents and now surely transcended Homo sapiens. Indeed, both men were alien beings, and in that frozen moment as they stared at each other they knew it. Then - Dragosani saw the shotgun in Harry\u0027s hands but couldn\u0027t know it was useless. Hissing his hatred and expecting at any moment to hear the weapon\u0027s roar, he bounded to Borowitz\u0027s great oak desk and fumbled for a machine-pistol. Harry reversed the shotgun, stepped forward and dealt the necromancer a crashing blow to the head and neck where he scrabbled at the desk. Dragosani was knocked flying, the machine-pistol thud\u0026shy;ding to the carpeted floor. He collided with a wall and for a moment stood there spread-eagled, then went into a crouch. And now he saw that the shotgun in Harry\u0027s hands was broken where the stock joined the barrels, saw Harry\u0027s eyes frantically searching the room for another weapon, saw that he had the advantage and needed no weapon made by men to finish this thing. Galenski\u0027s bubbling screams from the anteroom were suddenly cut off. Harry backed towards the half-open door. Dragosani wasn\u0027t about to let him go. He leaped forward, grabbed him by the shoulder and held him effortlessly with one hand at arm\u0027s length. Hypnotised by the sheer horror of the man\u0027s face, Harry found it impossible to look away. He panted for air, felt himself squeezed dry by the awesome power of this creature. \u0027Aye, pant,\u0027 growled Dragosani. \u0027Pant like a dog, Harry Keogh - and die like a dog!\u0027 And he bayed a laugh like nothing Harry had ever heard before. Still holding his victim, now the necromancer crouched down into himself and his jaws opened wide. Needle teeth dripped slime and something moved in his gaping mouth which wasn\u0027t quite a tongue. His nose seemed to flatten to his face and grew ridged, like the convoluted snout of a bat, and one scarlet eye bulged hideously while the other narrowed to a mere slit. Harry stared directly into hell and couldn\u0027t look away. And knowing he\u0027d won, finally Dragosani hurled his bolt of mental horror - at which precise moment the door behind Harry crashed open and threw him from the necromancer\u0027s grasp. The door gave him cover where he fell to the floor, while at the same time another stepped creakingly into the room to take the full force of Dragosani\u0027s blast. And seeing what had entered, too late Dragosani remembered Max Batu\u0027s warning: how one must never curse the dead, for the dead can\u0027t die twice! The bolt was deflected, reflected, turned upon Drago\u0026shy;sani himself. In Batu\u0027s story a man had been shrivelled by just such a blast, but in Dragosani\u0027s case it wasn\u0027t as bad as that - or perhaps it was worse. He seemed picked up in some giant\u0027s fist and hurled across the room. Bones snapped in his legs where they hit the desk, and he was set spinning by his own momen\u0026shy;tum. The wall brought him up short again,, but this time he crumpled to the floor. And clawing himself up into a seated position, he screamed continuously in a voice like a giant\u0027s chalk on slate. His broken legs flopped on floor as if they were made of rubber, and he flailed his arms spastically, blindly in the air before his face. Blindly, yes, for that was where his own mind-blast had struck home: his eyes! Coming from behind the shielding door Harry saw the necromancer sitting there and gasped. It was as if Dragosani\u0027s eyes had exploded from within. Their centres were craters in his face, with threads of crimson gristle hanging down on to his hollow cheeks. Harry knew it was over then and the shock of it all caught up with him. Sickened, he turned away from Dragosani, saw his hench\u0026shy;men waiting. \u0027Finish it,\u0027 he told them. And they creakingly advanced on the stricken monster. Dragosani was quite blind now, and so too the vampire within him, which had seen with his eyes. But immature though the creature was, still its alien senses were sufficiently developed to recognise the inexorable approach of black, permanent oblivion. It sensed the stake held in the mummied claw, knew that a rusted sword was even now raised high. Ruined shell that he was, Dragosani was no use to the vampire now. And evil spirit that it was, it came out of him as if exorcised! He stopped screaming, choked, clawed at his throat. Froth and blood flew as his jaws opened impossibly wide and he began to shake his monstrous head frantically to and fro. His entire body was going into convulsions, beginning to vibrate as the pain within grew greater than that of ruptured eyes and broken bones. Any other must surely have died there and then, but Dragosani was no other. His neck grew fat and his grey face turned crimson, then blue. The vampire withdrew itself from his brain, uncoiled from his inner organs, tore itself loose from nerves and spinal cord. It formed barbs, used them to drag itself head-first up the column of his throat and out of him. Slopping blood and mucus, he coughed the thing endlessly on to his chest. And there it coiled, a great leech, its flat head swaying like that of a cobra, scarlet with the blood of its host. And there the stake pinned it, passed through the vampire\u0027s pulsating body and into Dragosani, driven home by hands that shed small bones even as they secured the horror in its place. And a single stroke from the second Tartar\u0027s whistling sword completed the job, strik\u0026shy;ing its flat, loathsome head free from its madly whipping body. Emptied, tortured, very nearly mindless, Dragosani lay there, his arms flopping. And as Harry Keogh said: \u0027And now finish him,\u0027 so the necromancer\u0027s twitching hand found the machine-pistol where it had fallen to the carpeted floor. Somewhere in his burning brain he had recognised Keogh\u0027s voice, and even knowing he was dying, still his evil and vengeful nature surfaced one last time. Yes, he was going - but he would not go alone. The weapon in his crab-like hands coughed once, stutt\u0026shy;ered briefly, then chattered a continuous stream of mech\u0026shy;anical obscenities until its vocabulary and magazine were empty - which was perhaps half a second after an ancient Tartar sword had split Dragosani\u0027s monstrous skull open from ear to ear. Pain! Searing pain. And death. For both of them. Almost cut in half, Harry found a Mobius door and toppled through it. But pointless to take his shattered body with him. That was finished now. Mind was all. And as he entered the Mobius continuum, so he reached out and guided, dragged the necromancer\u0027s mind with him. Now the pain was finished, for both of them, and Dragosani\u0027s first thought was: \u0027Where am I?\u0027 \u0027Where I want you,\u0027 Harry told him. He found the door to past-time and opened it. From Dragosani\u0027s mind a thin red light streamed out amidst the blue brilliance. It was the trail of his vampire-ridden past. \u0027Follow that,\u0027 said Harry, expelling Dragosani through the door. Falling into the past, Dragosani clung to his past-life thread and was drawn back, back. And he couldn\u0027t leave that scarlet thread even if he wanted to, for it was him. Harry watched the scarlet thread winding back on itself, taking Dragosani with it, then searched out and found the door to the future. Somewhere out there his broken life-thread continued, began again. All he had to do was find it. And so he hurled himself into the blue infinity of tomorrow ... FINAL INTERVAL: Alec Kyle glanced at his watch. It was 4:15 p.m. and he was already fifteen minutes late for his all-important governmental board. But time, however relative, had flown and Kyle felt desiccated; the papers in front of him had grown to a thick sheaf; his whole body was cramped and the muscles in his right hand, wrist and arm felt tied in knots. He couldn\u0027t write another word. \"I\u0027ve missed the board,\u0027 he said, and hardly recognised his own voice. The words came out in a dry croak. He tried to laugh and managed a cough. \u0027Also, I think I\u0027m missing a couple of pounds! I haven\u0027t moved from this chair in over seven hours, but it\u0027s been the best day\u0027s exercise I\u0027ve had in years. My suit feels loose on me. And dirty!\u0027 The spectre nodded. \u0027I know,\u0027 he said, \u0027and I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ve taxed your mind and body both. But don\u0027t you think it was worth it?\u0027 \u0027Worth it?\u0027 Kyle laughed again, and this time made it. \u0027The Soviet E-Branch is destroyed -\u0027 \u0027Will be,\u0027 the other corrected him, \u0027a week from now.\u0027 \u0027 - and you ask if it\u0027s been worth it? Oh, yes!\u0027 Then his face fell. \u0027But I\u0027ve missed the board. That was important.\u0027 \u0027Not really,\u0027 the spectre told him. \u0027Anyway, you didn\u0027t miss it. Or rather, you did but I didn\u0027t.\u0027 Kyle frowned, shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027 Time -\u0027 the other began. \u0027 - Is relative!\u0027 Kyle finished it for him in a gasp. The spectre smiled. \u0027There\u0027s a door to all times out there on the Mobius strip. I am here - but I\u0027m also there. They might have given you a hard time, but not me. Gormley\u0027s work - your work, and mine - goes on. You\u0027ll get all the help you need and no hassle.\u0027 Kyle slowly closed his mouth, let his brain reel for a moment until it steadied itself. He felt weary now, worn out. \u0027I expect you\u0027ll want to be going now,\u0027 he said, \u0027but there are still a couple of things I\u0027d like to ask you. I mean, I know who you are, for you couldn\u0027t be anyone else, but -\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027Well, where are you now? I mean, your now? What\u0027s your base? Where is it? Are you speaking to me from the Mobius continuum, or through it? Harry, where are you?\u0027 Again the spectre\u0027s patient smile. \u0027Ask instead, \"who are you?\u0027\" he said. And answered: \u0027I\u0027m still Harry Keogh. Harry Keogh Junior.\u0027 Kyle\u0027s mouth once more fell open. It was all there in his notes but it hadn\u0027t jelled, until now. Now the pieces fell into place. \u0027But Brenda - I mean, your wife - was due to die. Her death has been foretold. And how can anyone change or avoid the future? You yourself have shown how that\u0027s impossible.\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027She will die,\u0027 he said. \u0027Briefly, in childbirth, she\u0027ll die - but the dead won\u0027t accept her.\u0027 \u0027The dead won\u0027t - ?\u0027 Kyle was lost. \u0027Death is a place beyond the body,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027The dead have their own existence. Some of them knew it but most didn\u0027t. Now they do. It will change nothing in the world of the living, but it means a lot to the dead. Also, they understand that life is precious. They know because they\u0027ve lost it. If Brenda dies, my life, too, will be in jeopardy. That\u0027s something they can\u0027t allow. They owe . me, you see?\u0027 They won\u0027t accept her? You mean they\u0027ll give her life back to her?\u0027 \u0027In a nutshell, yes. There are brilliant talents there in the netherworld, Alec, a billion of them. There\u0027s not much they can\u0027t do if they really want to. As for my own epitaph: that was just my mother being over-protective -and pessimistic!\u0027 His outline began to shimmer and the light from the windows seemed to glance more readily through him. \u0027And now I think it\u0027s time I -\u0027 \u0027Wait!\u0027 said Kyle, starting to his feet. \u0027Wait, please. Just one more thing.\u0027 Harry raised ghostly eyebrows. \u0027But I thought I\u0027d explained it all. And even if I haven\u0027t, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll work it out.\u0027 Kyle quickly nodded his agreement. \u0027I\u0027m sure I will -1 think. All except why. Why did you bother to come back and tell me?\u0027 \u0027Simple,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027My son will be me. But he will have his own personality, he will be his own being. I don\u0027t know how much of the real me will get through to him, that\u0027s all. There might be times when he, we, need reminding. One thing\u0027s certain, though: he\u0027ll be a very talented boy!\u0027 And at last Kyle understood. \u0027You want me - us, the branch - to sort of look after him, is that it?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s it,\u0027 said Harry Keogh, beginning to fade away, shimmering now with a strange blue light, as though composed of a million fibre-thin neons. \u0027You\u0027ll look after him - until he\u0027s ready to start looking after you. All of you. Do you think you can do that?\u0027 Kyle stumbled out from behind his desk, held out his arms to the shimmering, rapidly diminishing spectral thing. \u0027Oh, yes! Yes, we can do that!\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s all I ask,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027And also that you look after his mother.\u0027 The blue shimmer became a haze, snapped into a single vertical line or tube of electric blue light, shortened to a single point of blinding blue fire at eye-level - and blinked out. And Kyle knew that Keogh had gone to be born. \u0027We\u0027ll do it, Harry!\u0027 he shouted hoarsely, feeling tears hot on his cheeks and not knowing why he cried. \u0027We\u0027ll do it... Harry?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-necroscope-1/page-17.html","bookId":2436,"book":{"id":2436,"title":"Necroscope (Necroscope #1)","description":"Storyline: Harry is an English youth in school, and strange things occur as he grows up, such as a sudden increased intellect in mathematics, and the ability to fight beyond his experience after a teacher is killed.
