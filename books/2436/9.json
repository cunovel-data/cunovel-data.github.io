{"id":78772,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"The summer of 1975...\\n\\n Three years since Dragosani\u0027s last trip home, and only a year short of that time when the old thing in the earth had promised to deliver up his secrets to Dragosani, the secrets of the Wamphyri. In return for which, Dragosani would give him back his life - or rather, he would return him to renewed undeath, to walk the earth again.\\n\\n Three years, and the necromancer had gone from strength to strength until his position as Gregor Borowitz\u0027s right-hand man now seemed virtually unassailable. When the old man went, Dragosani would be the one to replace him. After that, with the entire Soviet ESP organisation at his command, and with all the knowledge of the Wamphyri in his hands and mind - the possibilities were vast.\\n\\n What had once seemed an impossible dream might still come to pass, when old Wallachia would once more become a mighty nation - the mightiest nation of all. Why not, with Dragosani to lead the way? A mortal man can achieve very little in his short span of years, but an immortal man might achieve anything. And with that thought in mind, a question Dragosani had often asked himself cropped up yet again: if it was true that longevity meant power, and immortality ultimate power, why had the Wamphyri themselves failed? Why weren\u0027t vampires the leaders and rulers of this world?\\n\\n Dragosani had long since worked out something of an answer; right or wrong he could not yet say:\\n\\n To man the concept of a vampire is abhorrent �C the very concept itself! If men believed - if they were given indisputable proof of vampiric infestation - then they would seek the creatures out and destroy them. This had been the way of it since time began, since a time when men really did believe, and it had limited the vampire in his scope. He dare not reveal himself, must not be seen to be different, to be alien. He must control as best he might his passions, his lusts, his natural craving for the sheer power he knows his evil arts could bring him. For to have power, whether political or financial or of any other sort, is to be scrutinised - which is the one thing above all others that a vampire dreads! For under prolonged scrutiny he must be discovered and destroyed.\\n\\n But if a mere man could control a vampire\u0027s arts �C a living man, as opposed to an undead Thing - he would suffer no such restrictions. Having nothing to hide but his dark knowledge itself... why, he could achieve almost anything!\\n\\n That was why Dragosani had journeyed yet again to Romania; conscious of the fact that his duties had kept him away for far too long, he wished to speak once more with the old devil and offer him small favours, and learn whatever there was to be learned before next summer, when the time appointed would be at hand.The time appointed, yes - when all the vampire\u0027s secrets would lie naked before him, open and revealing as an eviscerated corpse!\\n\\n Three years had flown by since last he was here, and they had been busy years. Busy for Dragosani because over that entire period Gregor Borowitz had driven all of his ESPers, including the necromancer, to the limits of their capabilities. Of course he had: to ensure that in the four years Leonid Brezhnev had allowed him, in which he must turn a profit, his branch would become so firmly entrenched as to be indispensable. And now the Premier had seen that it was indeed utterly indispensable. What\u0027s more, it was the most secret of all his secret services and by far the most independent - which was the way Gregor Borowitz wanted it.\\n\\n Through Bbrowitz\u0027s advance warning, Brezhnev had been fully prepared for the fall from grace of his one-time political pal Richard Nixon in the USA. And where Watergate might have hindered or even ruined many another Russian premier, Brezhnev had actually managed to reap some benefits from it - but only by virtue of Borowitz\u0027s (or more properly Igor Vlady\u0027s) predictions. \u0027A pity,\u0027 Brezhnev had told Borowitz at the time, \u0027that Nixon didn\u0027t have you working for him, eh, Gregor?\u0027\\n\\n Similarly, and also as predicted, the Premier now found himself advantageously placed in his dealings with the presidential \u0027stand-in\u0027, at best a bumbler; and before Nixon\u0027s fall, as early as 1972, knowing in advance that there were American hard-liners still to come, Brezhnev had taken Borowitz\u0027s advice and signed satellite agreements with the USA. Moreover, and especially since America was so far advanced in space technology, he had also been quick to put his signature to the ultimate \u0027d��tente\u0027 coup of his career: a joint Skylab space venture, which even now was coming to fruition.\\n\\n Indeed, the Soviet premier had taken the initiative on these and many other ESP-Branch suggestions or prognoses - including the expulsion of many dissidents and the \u0027repatriation\u0027 of Jews - and every step he had taken so far had been completely successful in bolstering his already awesome position as Leader. And much if not all of the credit due directly to Borowitz and his branch, so that Brezhnev had been pleased to honour his and Borowitz\u0027s agreement of 1971.\\n\\n Thus, as Brezhnev and his regime prospered, so prospered Gregor Borowitz; likewise Boris Dragosani, whose loyalty to the branch seemed unquestionable. And in fact it was unquestionable - for the moment...\\n\\n While Gregor Borowitz had secured the permanence of his branch and climbed in Leonid Brezhnev\u0027s esteem, however, his relationship with Yuri Andropov had deteriorated at a directly proportionate rate; there was no overt hostility, but behind the scenes Andropov was as jealous and scheming as ever. Dragosani knew that Borowitz continued to watch Andropov closely. What the necromancer did not know was that Borowitz also watched him! Oh, Dragosani was not under any sort of surveillance, but there was that in his attitude which had been worrying his boss for quite some time. Dragosani had always been arrogant, even insubordinate, and Borowitz had accepted that and even enjoyed it - but this was something else. Borowitz suspected it was ambition; which was fine, as long as the necromancer didn\u0027t become too ambitious.\\n\\n Dragosani too had noticed the change in himself, Despite the fact that one of his oldest inhibitions, his greatest \u0027hangup\u0027, was now extinct, he had grown if anything colder still towards members of the opposite sex. When he took a woman it was invariably brutally, with little or nothing of love in it but purely as a release for his own pent-up emotional and physical needs. And as for ambition: at times he had difficulty controlling his frustration and could hardly wait for the day when Borowitz would be out of his way. The old man was past it, a dodderer, his usefulness was on the wane. This was not in fact the case, but such was Dragosani\u0027s own energy -the rapid acceleration and growth of his drive and character - that it seemed that way to him. And that was another reason why he had returned this time to Romania: so that he might obtain the counselling of the Thing in the ground. For like it or not, Dragosani had begun to accept the vampire as a sort of father-figure. Who else could he talk to, in absolute confidence, of his ambitions and his frustrations? Who else if not the old dragon? No one. In a way the vampire was like an oracle... but in another way he was not. Unlike an oracle, Dragosani could never be sure of the validity of any of his statements. Which meant that while he had felt himself drawn back here, to Romania, still he must be careful of his dealings with the Thing in the ground.\\n\\n These were some of the thoughts which passed through his mind as he drove up through the old country from Bucharest towards Pitesti; and as his Volga passed a signpost which stated that the town was sixteen kilometres ahead, he remembered how three years ago he had been on his way to Pitesti when Borowitz had recalled him to Moscow. Strangely, he had not given thought to the library in Pitesti from that day to this, but now he felt himself drawn again to visit the place. He still knew so very little about vampirism and the undead, and what knowledge he did have was dubious in that it had come from the vampire himself. But if ever a library was the seat of local lore and legend, then surely the reference library in Pitesti was that one.\\n\\n Dragosani remembered the place from his years at the college in Bucharest. The college had often used to borrow old documents and records concerning Wallachian and ancient Romanian matters from Pitesti, for a great amount of historical material had been taken there for safety from Ploiesti and Bucharest during World War II. In the case of Ploiesti this had been a wise move, for the city had suffered some of the worst bombing of the war. In any case, much of the material had not found its way back to the original museums and libraries but remained in Pitesti even now. Certainly it had been there as recently as eighteen or nineteen years ago.\\n\\n So ... the old Thing in the ground could wait a little longer on Dragosani\u0027s return. He would go first to the library in Pitesti, have lunch later in the town, and only then carry on into the heart of his homeland...\\n\\n By 11:00 a.m. Dragosani was there, had introduced himself to the librarian on duty, asked to be allowed to see any documents pertaining to boyar families, lands, battles, monuments, ruins and burial grounds, or any records at all for the regions comprising Wallachia and Moldavia - and especially local areas - circa the mid-fifteenth-century. The librarian seemed agreeable enough and only too pleased to assist (despite the fact that he appeared to find Dragosani\u0027s request a little amusing, or sufficiently so to cause him to smile) but after he had taken his visitor to the room which housed those old records... then Dragosani had been able to appreciate the funny side of it for himself.\\n\\n In a room of barnlike dimensions he found shelves containing sufficient of books and documents and records to fill several large army trucks, all of it relating to his inquiry! \u0027But... isn\u0027t it catalogued?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Of course, sir,\u0027 the young ^librarian told him, smiling again; and he produced an armful of catalogues whose heading alone - if Dragosani had been willing to contemplate such a task - would have taken several days in itself; and that without taking down one of the listed items from its shelf.\\n\\n \u0027But it would take a year or more to sift through this lot!\u0027 he finally complained.\\n\\n \u0027It has already taken twenty,\u0027 the other told him, \u0027and that was simply for the purpose of cataloguing - or mainly for that purpose. But that is not the only difficulty. For even if you could afford so much time, still you would not be allowed it. At last the authorities are splitting it up; much is returning to Bucharest, a large amount is scheduled for Budapest, even Moscow has made application. It will be moved, most of it, some time in the next three months.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well you\u0027re right,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027I haven\u0027t years or months but just a few days. So ... I wonder if there\u0027s some way I might narrow my search down?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said the other. \u0027But then there\u0027s the question of language. Do you wish to see Turkish language records?... Hungarian?... German? Is your interest purely Slavicist? Is it Christian or Ottoman? Do you have any specific points of reference - landmarks, as it were? All of the material here is at least three hundred years old, but some of it dates back seven centuries and more! As I\u0027m sure you\u0027re aware, the central span - which seems to be the seat of your interest - covers many decades of constant flux. Here are the records of foreign conquerors, yes, but we also have the records of those who thrust them out. Are you capable of understanding the texts of these works? They are, after all, half a millennium old. If you can understand them, then you\u0027re a scholar indeed! I certainly can\u0027t, not with any degree of accuracy - and I\u0027ve been trained to read them...\u0027\\n\\n And then, seeing Dragosani\u0027s look of helplessness, he had added: \u0027Sir, perhaps if you could be more specific...?\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani saw no reason for subterfuge. \u0027I\u0027m interested in the vampire myth, which seems to have had its roots right here - in Transylvania, Moldavia, Wallachia - and dates back, so far as is known, to the fifteenth century.\u0027\\n\\n The librarian took a pace back from him, lost his smile. Suddenly he seemed wary. \u0027But you are surely not a tourist?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, basically I\u0027m Romanian, now living and working in Moscow. But what\u0027s that got to do with it?\u0027\\n\\n The librarian, perhaps three or four years younger than\\n\\n Dragosani and obviously a little awed by his almost cosmopolitan appearance, seemed to be giving the matter a deal of consideration. He chewed his lip, frowned and was silent for long moments. But at last he said, \u0027If you\u0027ll take a look at them, you\u0027ll note that those catalogues I gave you are mainly hand-written and penned in one uniform hand throughout. And I\u0027ve already told you that there\u0027s at least twenty years of work in them. Well, the man who did that work is still alive and lives not far away, in Titu. That\u0027s towards Bucharest, about twenty-five miles.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know the place,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027I drove throughhere not half an hour ago. Do you think he could help me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes - if he wanted to.\u0027 That sounded cryptic. \u0027Well, go on - ?\u0027\\n\\n The librarian seemed unsure, looked away for a moment. \u0027Oh, I made a mistake two or three years ago, sent a couple of American \"researchers\" to see him. He wanted no truck with them, threw them out! A bit eccentric, you see? Since that time I\u0027m more careful.We\u0027ve had a good many requests of this nature, you understand. This \"Dracula\" thing is something of an industry, apparently, in the West. And it\u0027s this commercial aspect that Mr Giresci is anxious to avoid. That\u0027s his name, by the way: Ladislau Giresci.\u0027\u0027Are you telling me that this man is an expert on vampirism?\u0027 Dragosani felt his interest quickening. \u0027Do you mean to say that he\u0027s been studying the legends, tracing their history through these documents, for twenty-odd years?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, among other things, yes, that\u0027s what I\u0027m saying. It\u0027s been what you might call a hobby - or perhaps an obsession - with him. But a very useful obsession where the library has been concerned.\u0027\\n\\n Then I have to go and see him! It might save me a great deal of time and wasted energy.\u0027\\n\\n The librarian shrugged. \u0027Well, I can give you directions, and his address, but ... it will be entirely up to him whether or not he\u0027ll see you. It might help if you took him a bottle of whisky. He\u0027s a great whisky man, when he can afford it - but the Scottish sort and not that filth they brew in Bulgaria!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You just give me his address,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027He\u0027ll see me, all right. Of that I can assure you.\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani found the place just as the librarian had described it, on the Bucharest road about a mile outside of Titu. On a small estate of wooden, two-storey houses set back from the road in a few acres of woodland, Ladislau Giresci\u0027s place was conspicuous by its comparative isolation. All of the houses had gardens or plots of ground surrounding them and separating them from their neighbours, but Giresci\u0027s house stood well away from all others on the rim of the estate, lost in a stand of pines, hedgerows run wild amid untended shrubbery and undergrowth.\\n\\n The cobbled drive leading to the house itself had been narrowed by burgeoning hedges, where leafy creepers were throwing their tendrils across the cobbles; the gar dens were overgrown and slowly returning to the wilderness; the house was visibly affected by dry rot in a fairly advanced state, and wore an atypical air of almost total neglect. By comparison, the other houses on the estate were in good order and their gardens well maintained. Some small effort had been made at maintenance and repair, however, for here and there at the front of the house an old board had been removed and a new one nailed in place, but even the most recent of these must be all of five years old. The path from the garden gate to the front door was likewise overgrown, but Dragosani persisted and knocked upon panels from which the last flakes of paint were fast falling.\\n\\n In one hand he carried a string bag containing a bottle of whisky bought from the liquor store in Pitesti, a loaf of bread, a wedge of cheese, some fruit. The food was for himself (his lunch, if nothing else was available) and the bottle, as advised, for Giresci. If he was at home. As Dragosani waited, that began to seem unlikely; but after knocking again, louder this time, finally he heard movement from within.\\n\\n The figure which finally opened the door to him was male, perhaps sixty years of age, and fragile as a pressed flower. His hair was white - not grey but white, like a crest of snow upon the hill of his brow - and his skin was even paler than Dragosani\u0027s own, with a shine to it as if it were polished. His right leg was wooden, an old peg as opposed to any sort of modern prosthetic device, but he seemed to handle his disability with more than sufficient agility. His back was a little bent and he held one shoulder gingerly and winced when he moved it; but his eyes were keen, brown and sure, and as he enquired as to Dragosani\u0027s business his breath was clean and healthy.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t know me, Mr Giresci,\u0027 said Dragosani, \u0027but I\u0027ve learned something of you, and what I\u0027ve learned has fascinated me. I suppose you could say I\u0027m something of a historian, whose special interest lies way back in old Wallachia. And I\u0027ve been told that no one knows the history of these parts better than you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm!\u0027 said Giresci, looking his visitor up and down. \u0027Well, there are professors at the university in Bucharest who\u0027d dispute that - but I wouldn\u0027t!\u0027 He stood blocking the way inside, seemingly uncertain, but Dragosani noted that his brown eyes went again to the string bag and the bottle.\\n\\n \u0027Whisky,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027I\u0027m partial to a drop and it\u0027s hard stuff to come by in Moscow. Maybe you\u0027ll join me in a glass - while we talk?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 Giresci barked. \u0027And who said we were going to talk?\u0027 But again his eyes went to the bottle, and in a softer tone: \u0027Scotch, did you say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course. There\u0027s only one real whisky, and that\u0027s -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s your name, young man?\u0027 Giresci cut him off. He still blocked the way into his house, but his eyes held a look of interest now.\\n\\n \u0027Dragosani. Boris Dragosani. I was born in these parts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And is that why you\u0027re interested in their history? Somehow I don\u0027t think so.\u0027 From frank and open scrutiny, now his eyes took on a look of wary suspicion. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t be representing any foreigners, would you? Americans, for example?\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani smiled. \u0027On the contrary,\u0027 he said. \u0027No, for I know you\u0027ve had trouble with strangers before. But I\u0027ll not lie to you, Ladislau Giresci, my interest is probably the same as theirs was. I was given your address by the librarian in Pitesti.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah?\u0027 said Giresci. \u0027Is that so? Well, he knows well enough who I\u0027ll see and who I won\u0027t see, so it seems your credentials must be all right. But let\u0027s hear it from you now - from your own lips - and no holding back: just what is your interest?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well\u0027 (Dragosani could see no way round it, and little point in hedging the matter anyway), \u0027I want to know about vampires.\u0027\\n\\n The other stared hard at him, seemed not at all surprised. \u0027Dracula, you mean?\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani shook his head. \u0027No. I mean real vampires. The vampir of Transylvanian legend - the cult of the Wamphyri!\u0027\\n\\n At that Giresci gave a start, winced again as his bad shoulder jumped, leaned forward a little and grasped Dragosani\u0027s arm. He breathed heavily for a moment and said: \u0027Oh? The Wamphyri, eh? Well - perhaps I will talk to you. Yes, and certainly I\u0027d appreciate a glass of whisky. But first you tell me something. You said you wanted to know about the real vampire, the legend. Are you sure you don\u0027t mean the myth? Tell me, Dragosani: do you believe in vampires?\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani looked at him. Giresci was watching him keenly, waiting, almost holding his breath. And something told Dragosani that he had him. \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 he said softly, after a moment. \u0027Indeed I do!\u0027\u0027Hmm!\u0027 the other nodded - and stood aside. \u0027Then you\u0027d better come in, Mr Dragosani. Come in, come in -and we\u0027ll talk.\u0027\\n\\n However dilapidated Giresci\u0027s place might look from outside, inside it was as clean and neat as any cripple living on his own could possibly keep it. Dragosani was pleasantly surprised at the sense of order he felt as he followed his host through rooms panelled in locally crafted oak, where carpets patterned in the old Slavic tradition kept one\u0027s feet from sliding on warmly glowing, age-polished pine boards. However rustic, the place was warm and welcoming - on the one hand. But on the other -\\n\\n Giresci\u0027s penchant - hisall-consuming\u0027hobby\u0027or obsession - was alive and manifest in every room. It saturated the atmosphere of the house in exactly the same way as mummy-cases in a museum inspire a sense of endless ergs of sand and antique mystery - except that here the picture was of bitter mountain passes and fiercepride, of cold wastes and aching loneliness, of a procession of endless wars and blood and incredible cruelties. The rooms were old Romania. This was Wallachia. The walls of one room were hung with old weapons, swords, pieces of armour. Here was an early sixteenth-century arquebusier, and here a vicious barbed pike. A black, pitted cannonball from a small Turkish cannon held open a door (Giresci had found it on an ancient battlefield near the ruins of a fortress close to Tirgoviste) and a pair of ornate Turkish scimitars decorated the wall over the fireplace. There were terrible axes, maces and flails, and a badly battered and rusty cuirass, with the breastplate hacked almost in half from the top. The wall of the corridor which divided the main living-room from the kitchen and bedrooms was hung with framed prints or likenesses of the infamous Vlad princes, and with boyar family genealogies. There were family crests and motifs, too, complicated battle maps, sketches (from Giresci\u0027s own hand) of crumbling fortifications, tumuli, earthworks, ruined castles and keeps.\\n\\n And books! Shelf upon shelf of them, most of them crumbling - and many quite obviously valuable - but all rescued by Giresci wherever he had found them over the years: in sales, old bookshops and antique shops, or from estates fallen into poverty or ruin along with the once-powerful aristocracy. All in all, the house was a small museum in itself, and Giresci the sole keeper and curator.\\n\\n \u0027This arquebusier,\u0027 Dragosani remarked at one point, \u0027must be worth a small fortune!\u0027\\n\\n To a museum or a collector, possibly,\u0027 said his host. \u0027I\u0027ve never looked into the question of value. But how\u0027s this for a weapon?\u0027 And he handed Dragosani a crossbow.\\n\\n Dragosani took it, weighed it in his hand, frowned. The weapon was fairly modern, heavy, probably as accurate as a rifle, and very deadly. The interesting thing was that its \u0027bolt\u0027 was of wood, possibly lignum vitae, with a tip of polished steel. Also, it was loaded. \u0027It certainly doesn\u0027t fit in with the rest of your stuff,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Giresci grinned, showing strong square teeth. \u0027Oh but\\n\\n it does! My \"other stuff\u0027, as you put it, tells what was, what might still be. This crossbow is my answer to it. A deterrent. A weapon against it.\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani nodded. \u0027A wooden stake through the heart, eh? And would you really hunt a vampire with this?\u0027\\n\\n Giresci grinned again, shook his head. \u0027Nothing so foolish,\u0027 he said. \u0027Anyone who seeks to hunt down a vampire has to be a madman! I am merely eccentric. Hunt one? Never! But what if a vampire decided to hunt me? Call it self-protection, if you will. Anyway, I feel happier with it in the house.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But why would you fear such a thing? I mean - all right, I\u0027m in agreement with you that such creatures have existed and still do, possibly - but why would one of them bother itself with you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you were a secret agent,\u0027 said Giresci, (at which Dragosani smiled inside) \u0027would you be happy - would you ever feel safe - knowing that some outsider knew your business, your secrets? Of course you wouldn\u0027t. And what of the Wamphyri? Now ... I think that perhaps the risk is a very small one - but twenty years ago when I bought this weapon I wasn\u0027t so sure. I had seen something which would stay with me for the rest of my life. Such creatures really were, yes, and I knew about them. And the more I looked into their legend, their history, the more monstrous they became. In those days I could not sleep for my nightmares. Buying the crossbow was like whistling in the dark, I suppose: it might not keep away the dark forces, but at least it would let them know that I wasn\u0027t afraid of them!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Even if you were?\u0027 said Dragosani.\\n\\n Giresci\u0027s keen eyes looked deep into his own. \u0027Of course I was,\u0027 he finally answered. \u0027What? Here in Romania? Here under these mountains? In this house, where I\u0027ve amassed and studied the evidence? I was frightened, yes. But now\\n\\n \u0027Now?\u0027\\n\\n The other pulled a half-disappointed face. \u0027Well I\u0027m still here, alive after all these years. Nothing has \"happened\" to me, has it? And so now... now I think that maybe they are, after all, extinct. Oh, they existed - if anyone knows that, I do - but perhaps the last of them has gone forever. I hope so, anyway. But what about you? What do you say, Dragosani?\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani gave the weapon back. \u0027I say keep your crossbow, Ladislau Giresci. And I say look to its maintenance. Also, I say be careful who you invite into your house!\u0027\\n\\n He reached into his inside pocket for a packet of cigarettes, froze as Giresci aimed the crossbow directly at his heart across a distance of only six or seven feet and took off the safety catch. \u0027But I am careful,\u0027 said the other, still staring directly into his eyes. \u0027We apparently know so much, you and I. I know why I believe, but what of you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me?\u0027 inside his jacket, Dragosani slipped his issue pistol from its under-arm holster.\\n\\n \u0027A stranger in search of a legend, apparently. But such a knowing stranger!\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani shrugged, palmed the grip of his gun, began to turn its muzzle towards Giresci. At the same time he turned slightly to the right. Perhaps Giresci was insane. A pity. Also a pity that there would be a hole right through Dragosani\u0027s jacket and powder burns on the lining, but -\\n\\n Giresci put on the crossbow\u0027s safety, set it down on a small table. Too cool by far,\u0027 he laughed, \u0027for a vampire faced with a wooden stake! And you know: the pressure on that wooden bolt is set to transfix a man but not pass right through him and out the back. That would be no good. Only when the stake is in place is the creature truly immobilised, and - \u0027 His eyes went wide and his jaw dropped.\\n\\n Grey as death, Dragosani had taken out his gun, applied the safety, placed it beside the crossbow on the table. \u0027The pressure on that,\u0027 he rasped, is sufficient to blow your heart right out through your backbone! I also saw the mirrors on the walls of the corridor - and the way you looked into them as I passed. Too many mirrors by far, I thought. And the crucifix on the door, and doubtless another around your neck - for all the good they\u0027d be. Well, and am I a vampire then, old man?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure what you are,\u0027 the other shook his head. \u0027But a vampire? No, not you. You came in out of the sun, after all. But think: a man, seeking me out, specifically desiring to know about the Wamphyri - even knowing that name: Wamphyri, which few if any others in the whole world know! Why, wouldn\u0027t you be cautious?\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani breathed deeply, relaxed a little. \u0027Well, your \"caution\" nearly cost you your life!\u0027 he said bluntly. \u0027So before we go any further, are there any more tricks up your sleeve?\u0027\\n\\n Giresci gave a shaky laugh. \u0027No, no,\u0027 he said. \u0027No, I think we understand each other now. Come, let\u0027s leave it at that for the moment. And here, let\u0027s see what else you have in that bag of yours.\u0027 He took the string bag from Dragosani and directed him to sit at a dining table close to an open window. \u0027It\u0027s shady there,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Cooler.\u0027\\n\\n The whisky\u0027s yours,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027The rest was for my lunch - except I\u0027m not sure now that I feel like eating! That crossbow of yours is a bloody thing!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course you can eat, of course you can! What?\\n\\n Cheese for lunch? No, I wouldn\u0027t hear of it. I\u0027ve wood-cocks in the oven, done to a turn by now. A Greek recipe. Delicious. Whisky as an aperitif; bread to soak up the fat of the birds; cheese for afterwards. Good! An excellent lunch. And while we eat, I\u0027ll tell you my story, Dragosani.\u0027\\n\\n The younger man allowed himself to be placated, accepted a glass which the other produced from an old oak cabinet, allowed him to pour him a liberal whisky. Then Giresci hobbled off for a moment to the kitchen, and soon Dragosani began to sniff the air as the sweet odour of roasting meat slowly filled it. And Giresci had been right: it was delicious. Another moment and he was back with a smoking oven tray, directing Dragosani to get plates from a drawer. He tipped a brace of small birds on to his guest\u0027s plate, one on to his own. There were baked potatoes, too, and again Dragosani got the lion\u0027s share.\\n\\n Impressed by Giresci\u0027s generosity, he said: \u0027That\u0027s hardly fair on you.\u0027\\n\\n Tm drinking your whisky,\u0027 the other replied, \u0027so you can eat my birds. Anyway, I can shoot more any time I want them - right out of that window there. They\u0027re easy to get, but whisky\u0027s harder to come by! Believe me, I\u0027m getting the best of the bargain.\u0027\\n\\n They began to eat, and between mouthfuls Giresci started to tell his tale:\\n\\n \u0027It was during the war,\u0027 he said. \u0027When I was a boy, I hurt my back and shoulder very badly, which did away with any question of my being a soldier. But I wanted to do my bit anyway and so joined the Civil Defence. \"Civil Defence\" - Hah! Go to Ploiesti, even today, all these years later, and mention Civil Defence. Ploiesti burned, night after night. It just burned, Dragosani! How does one \"defend\" when the sky rains bombs?\\n\\n \u0027So I simply ran around with hundreds of others, dragging bodies out of burning or blasted buildings. Some of them were alive but most were not, and others would have been better off dead anyway. But it\u0027s amazing how quickly you get used to it. And I was very young and so got used to it all the more quickly. You\u0027re resilient when you\u0027re young. You know, in the end all the blood and the pain and the death didn\u0027t even seem to matter very much. Not to me, nor to the others who were doing the same job. You do it because it\u0027s there - like climbing a mountain. Except this was one where we could never get to the top. So we just kept on running around. Me, running! Can you picture that? But in those days I had both my legs, you see?\\n\\n \u0027And then... then there was this night when it was very bad. I mean, it was bad almost every night, but this one was - \u0027 He shook his head, lost for words.\\n\\n \u0027Outside Ploiesti, towards Bucharest, there were a good many old houses. They were the homes of the aristocracy, from the old days when there really was an aristocracy. Most of them were run down because people hadn\u0027t had the money to keep them going. Oh, the people who lived in them still had some money, land, but not that much. They were just hanging on, gradually decaying, falling apart along with their old houses. And that night, that\u0027s where a stick of bombs fell.\\n\\n \u0027I was driving an ambulance - a converted three-tonner, actually - between the city and the outskirts where they\u0027d rigged up hospitals in a couple of the larger houses. Up to then, you see, most of the bombing had been in the middle of town. Anyway, when that stick fell I was blown right off the road. And I thought I was a goner... done for. This is how it happened:\\n\\n \u0027One minute I was driving along - with the old rich houses on my right behind high walls, and the sky to the east and the south ruddy where the fire was reflected from the underside of the clouds - and the next all hell erupting from the very earth, it seemed! My ambulance was empty, thank God, for we\u0027d just completed one trip and unloaded a half-dozen badly injured people at one of the makeshift hospitals. There was just me and my co-driver, on our way back into Ploiesti, the truck bumping over old cobbled roads where debris was piled at every corner. And then the bombs came.\\n\\n \u0027They came marching across the rich old estates, thundering like berserker demons, blowing everything up into the air in great sheets of blinding light and sprays of brilliant red and yellow fire! They would have been awesomely beautiful, if they weren\u0027t so hellishly ugly! And they marched, yes, with the precise paces of soldiers, but gigantic. Three hundreds yards away, the first one, behind the private estates: a dull boom and a sudden glare, a volcanic spout of fire and mud, and the earth shuddering under my speeding truck. Two hundred and fifty yards, the second, flinging blazing trees and earth up to the sky high over the rooftops. Two hundred, and the fireball rising higher than the old stone walls, higher than the houses themselves. And each time the earth shuddering that much stronger, that much closer. Then the house on my immediate right, set back from the road at the head of a cobbled drive, seeming almost to jump on its foundations. And I knew where the next one would land. It would hit the house! And what about the one after that?\\n\\n \u0027And I was right - almost. For a split second the house was thrown into silhouette, lit up from behind, and the light so bright that it seemed to burn through stone and all, making of the gaunt old building a stony skeleton. Downstairs, behind bay windows, a figure stood with its arms held high, shaking them as in a great and terrible anger. Then, as the glare of that bomb faded and smoking earth rained out of the night, the next one hit the house.\\n\\n \"That was when hell came. As the roof was blasted off and the walls flew outward in ruin and belching fire and smoke, so the road in front of my truck seemed to bend up and back on itself like a wounded snake, whipping cobbles through my windscreen. And after that... everything was spinning, and everything was burning!\\n\\n \u0027The ambulance was like a toy in some mad child\u0027s fist: picked up, twirled around and hurled aside, off the road, blazing. I was unconscious only for a couple of seconds -maybe not even that, perhaps it was only shock or nausea - but when I came to my senses and crawled from the blazing vehicle it was with only seconds to spare. Mere seconds, and then... BOOM!\\n\\n \u0027As for my partner, the man in the truck with me: I didn\u0027t even know his name. Or if I ever did, I\u0027ve since forgotten it. I\u0027d met him just that night, and now said goodbye in a holocaust. He had a hook nose, that\u0027s all I remember. I hadn\u0027t seen him in the truck when I got out of there; if he was still in there, well that was the end of him. Anyway, I never saw him again...\\n\\n \u0027But the bombs were still raining down, and I was shivering, miserable, shocked and vulnerable. You know how vulnerable you really are when you\u0027ve just lost someone, even if you never knew him.\\n\\n Then I looked towards the house that was hit before the bomb landed on the road in front of me. Amazingly, some of it was still standing. The downstairs room with the bay windows was still there - no windows, just the room - or the shell of the room, anyway. But everything else was gone - or soon would be. The place was burning furiously.\\n\\n \u0027And that was when I remembered the angry figure I\u0027d seen silhouetted in that bay window, shaking its arms in fury. If the room was still there, mightn\u0027t the figure -mightn\u0027t he - also be there? It was instinct, the job, the unclimbable mountain. I ran towards the house. Maybe it was self-preservation, too, for one bomb had already landed on the house; it seemed unlikely that another would follow suit. Until the raid was over, I would be as safe there as anywhere. In my dazed condition I hadn\u0027t taken into account the fact that the place was burning, that its fires would be a beacon for the next wave of planes.\\n\\n \u0027I got to the house safely, climbed through the shattered bays and into what had been a library, found the angry man - or what was left of him. What should have been left of him was a corpse, but that wasn\u0027t how it was. I mean, the state he was in ... well, he should have been dead. But he wasn\u0027t. He was undead!\\n\\n \u0027Now Dragosani, I don\u0027t know how much you know about the Wamphyri. If you know a great deal, then the rest of what I have to say may not surprise you greatly. But I knew nothing, not then, and so what I saw - what I heard, the whole experience - was for me simply terrifying. Of course, you aren\u0027t the first to hear this story; I told it afterwards, or rather babbled it, and have told it several times since. But each time I\u0027ve been more reluctant, knowing that if I do tell it, it will only be greeted with scepticism or downright disbelief. However, since my experience was the initial jolt - the shock which set my search, research, and yes, obsession, in motion - it remains the single dominant memory of my entire lifetime, and so must be told. Although I\u0027ve drastically narrowed down my possible audiences over the years, still it must be told. Indeed you, Dragosani, will be the first to have heard it for seven years. The last one was an American who later wanted to re-write it and publish it as a sensational \"true story\", and I had to threaten him with a shotgun to change his mind. For obvious reasons I do not wish to draw attention to myself, which is precisely what his scheme would have done!\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, I can see how you\u0027re growing impatient, so let me get on:\\n\\n \u0027At first I could see nothing in that room but debris and damage. I didn\u0027t really expect to see anything. Nothing alive, anyway. The ceiling had caved in to one side; a wall had been split and buckled by the blast and was about to go; bookshelves had been tumbled everywhere and scattered volumes lay about in disarray, some burning and adding to the smoke and the fumes and the chaos. The reek of the bomb was heavy in the air, acrid and choking. And then there came that groan.\\n\\n \u0027Dragosani, there are groans and there are groans. The groans of men exhausted to the point of collapse, the life-giving groans of women in childbirth, the groans of the living before they become the dead. And then there are the groans of the undead! I knew nothing of it then: these were simply the sounds of agony. But such an agony, such an eternity of pain...\\n\\n They came from behind an old, overturned desk close to the blown-out bays where I stood. I clambered through the rubble, hauled at the desk until I could drag it upright on to its short legs and away from the riven wall. There, between where the desk had been tossed by the blast and the heavy skirting-board, lay a man. To all intents and purposes he was a man, anyway, and how was I to know different? You must judge for yourself, but let \"man\" suffice for now.\\n\\n \u0027His features were imposing; he would have been handsome but his face was contorted by agony. Tall, too, a big man - and strong! My God, how strong he must have been! This was what I thought when I saw his injuries. No man ever suffered such injuries before and lived - or if he did, then he was not a man.\\n\\n \u0027The ceiling was of age-blackened beams, a common enough feature in some of these old houses. Where it had caved in, a massive beam had snapped and its broken ends had fallen. One of these - a great splinter of age-brittled pine - had driven its point into and through the man\u0027s chest, through the floorboards beneath him, too, pinning him down like a beetle impaled on the spent stalk of a match. That alone should have killed him, must have killed any other but one of his sort. But that was not all.\\n\\n \u0027Something - the blast, it must have been, which can play weird tricks - had sliced his clothes up the middle like a great razor. From groin to rib-cage he was naked, and not only his clothes had been sliced. His belly, all trembling, a mass of raped and severed nerves, was laid back in two great flaps of flesh; all the viscera visible. His very guts were there, Dragosani, palpitating before my horrified eyes; but they were not what I expected, not the entrails of any ordinary man.\\n\\n \u0027Eh? What? I see the questions written in your face. What am I saying? you ask yourself. Entrails are entrails, guts are guts. They are slimy pipes, coiled tubes and smoking conduits; oddly shaped red and yellow and purple loaves of meat; strangely convoluted sausages and steamy bladders. Oh, yes, and indeed these things were there inside his ruptured trunk. But not alone these things. Something else was there!\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani listened, rapt, breathless; but while his interest was keen, with all his attention focused upon Giresci\u0027s story, still his face showed little or no true emotion or horror. And Giresci saw this. \u0027Ah!\u0027 he said. \u0027And you\u0027re not without strength yourself, my young friend, for there are plenty who would turn pale or puke at what I\u0027ve just said. And there\u0027s a lot more to be said yet. Very well, let\u0027s see how you take the rest...\\n\\n \u0027Now, I\u0027ve said there was something else inside this man\u0027s body cavity, and so there was. I caught a glimpse of it when first I saw him lying pinned there, and thought my eyes must be playing tricks with me. Anyway, we saw each other simultaneously, and after our eyes met for the first time the thing inside him seemed to shrink back and disappear behind the rest of his innards. Or ... perhaps I had simply imagined it to be there in the first place, eh? Well, as to what I thought I had seen: picture an octopus or a slug. But big, with tentacles twining round all the body\u0027s normal organs, centring in the region of the heart or behind it. Yes, picture a huge tumour - but mobile, sentient!\\n\\n \u0027It was there, it wasn\u0027t there, I had imagined it. So I thought. But there was no imagining this man\u0027s agony, his hideous wounds, the fact that only a miracle - many miracles - had so far saved his life. And no imagining that he had more than minutes or even seconds to live, either. Oh, no, for he was certainly done for.\\n\\n \u0027But he was conscious! Conscious, think of it! And try to imagine his torment, if you can. I could, and when he spoke to me I almost fainted from the shock of it. That he could think, have any sort of ordered thought process left in him, was... well, unthinkable. And yet he maintained something of control over himself. His Adam\u0027s apple bobbed, bulged, and he whispered:\\n\\n \u0027\"Pull it out. Drag it out of me. The point of the beam, draw it from my body.\"\\n\\n I recovered my senses, took off my jacket and put it carefully across his burst gut. This was for my good more than for his, you understand. I could have done nothing while his innards were exposed like that. Then I took hold of the beam.\\n\\n \"\u0027It\u0027ll do no good,\" I told him, nervously licking my lips. \"Look this will kill you outright! If I can get it out -and that\u0027s a big if - you\u0027ll die at once. I wouldn\u0027t be doing you any favours if I told you anything else.\"\\n\\n \u0027He managed to nod. \"Try, anyway,\" he gasped.\\n\\n \u0027And so I tried. Impossible! Three men couldn\u0027t have shifted it. It was literally jammed right through him and down into the floor. Oh, I moved it a little, and when I did great chunks of the ceiling came down and the wall settled ominously. Worse, a pool of blood welled up in the depression in his chest where the beam impaled him.\\n\\n \u0027At that he started groaning and rolling his eyes to set my teeth grating, and his body started vibrating under my jacket like someone had sent a jolt of electricity through him. And his feet, drumming the ground in an absolute fit of pain! But would you believe it? - even while this was going on his shivering hands came up like claws to grab that splintered stump where it pinned him, and he tried to add his own weight to mine as I strained to free him!\\n\\n \u0027It was all a waste of effort and both of us knew it. I told him:\\n\\n \u0027\"Even if we could draw it out, it would only bring the whole place down on you. Look, I have chloroform here. I can knock you out so you won\u0027t have the pain. But I have to be honest with you, you won\u0027t be waking up.\"\\n\\n \u0027\"No, no drugs!\" he gasped at once. \"I\u0027m... immune to chloroform. Anyway I have to stay conscious, stay in control. Get help, more men. Go - go quickly!\"\\n\\n \u0027\"There\u0027s no one!\" I protested. \"Who would there be out here? If there are any people around they\u0027ll be busy saving their own lives, their families, their property. This whole district has been bombed to hell!\" And even as I spoke there came the loud droning of bombers and, in the distance, the thunder of renewed bombing.\\n\\n \"No!\" he insisted. \"You can do it, I know you can. You\u0027ll find help and come back. You\u0027ll be well paid for it. believe me. And I won\u0027t die, I\u0027ll hang on. I\u0027ll wait. You ... you\u0027re my one chance. You can\u0027t refuse me!\" He was desperate, understandably.\\n\\n \u0027But now it was my turn to know agony: the agony of frustration, of complete and utter impotence. This brave, strong man, doomed to die here, now, in this place. And looking about me, I knew that I wouldn\u0027t have time to find anyone, knew that it was all over.\\n\\n \u0027His eyes followed my gaze, saw the flames where they were licking up outside the demolished bay windows. The smoke was getting thicker by the second as books burned freely, setting fire to tumbled shelves and furniture. Smoke was starting to curl down from the sagging ceiling, which even now settled a little more and sent down a shower of dust and plaster fragments.\\n\\n \u0027\"I ... I\u0027ll burn!\" he gasped then. For a moment his eyes were wide and bright with fear, but then a strange look of peaceful resignation came into them. \"It ... is finished.\"\\n\\n \u0027I tried to take his hand but he shook me off; and once more he muttered, \"Finished. After all these long centuries ...\"\\n\\n \u0027\"It was finished anyway,\" I told him. \"Your injuries... surely you must have known?\" I was anxious to make it as easy as possible for him. \"Your pain was so great that you\u0027ve crossed the pain threshold. You no longer feel it. At least there\u0027s that to be thankful for.\"\\n\\n \u0027At that he looked at me, and I saw scorn staring out of his eyes. \"My injuries? My pain?\" he repeated. \"Hah!\" And his short bark of a laugh was bitter as a green lemon, full of acid and contempt. \"When I wore the dragon-helm and got a lance through my visor, which broke the bridge of my nose, shot through and smashed out the back of my skull, that was pain!\" he growled. \"Pain, aye, for part of me - the real ME - had been hurt. That was Silistria, where we crushed the Ottoman. Oh, I know pain, my friend. We are old, old acquaintances, pain and I. In 1204 at Constantinople it was Greek fire. I had joined the Fourth Crusade in Zara, as a mercenary, and was burned for my trouble at the height of our triumph! Ah, but didn\u0027t we make them pay for it? For three whole days we pillaged, raped, slew. And I - in my agony, half eaten away, burned through almost to the very heart of ME - I was the greatest slayer of all! The human flesh had shrivelled but the Wamphyri lived on! And now this, pinned here and crippled, where the flames will find me and put an end to it. The Greek fire expired at last, but this one will not. Human pain and agony, I know nothing of them and care less. But Wamphyri pain? Impaled, burning, shrieking in the fire and melting away layer by layer? No, that must not be...\"\\n\\n These were his words as best I remember them. I thought he raved. Perhaps he was a historian? A learned man, certainly. But already the flames were leaping, the heat intolerable. I couldn\u0027t stay with him - but I couldn\u0027t leave him, not while he was conscious, anyway. I took out a cotton pad and a small bottle of chloroform, and -\\n\\n \u0027He saw my intention, knocked the unstoppered bottle from my hand. Its contents spilled, were consumed in blue flames in an instant. \"Fool!\" he hissed. \"You\u0027d only deaden the human part!\"\\n\\n \u0027My clothes were beginning to feel unbearably hot and small tongues of fire were tracing their way round the skirting-board. I could barely breathe. \"Why don\u0027t you die?\" I cried then, unable to tear myself away from him. \"For God\u0027s sake, die!\"\\n\\n \u0027\"God?\" he openly mocked me. \"Hah! No peace for me there, even if I believed. No room for me in your heaven, my friend.\"\u0027On the floor amongst other debris from the desk lay a paperknife. One edge of its blade was unusually keen. I took it up, approached him. My target would be his throat, ear to ear. It was as if he read my mind.\u0027\"Not good enough,\" he told me. \"It has to be the whole head.\"\\n\\n \u0027\"What?\" I asked him. \"What are you saying?\"\u0027Then he fixed me with his eyes. \"Come here.\"\u0027I could not disobey. I leaned over him, gazed down on him, held out the knife. He took it from me, tossed it away. \"Now we will do it my way,\" he said. \"The only sure way.\"\\n\\n \u0027I stared into his eyes and was held by them. They were... magnetic! If he had said nothing but merely held me with those eyes, then I would have remained there and burned with him. I knew it then and know it I now. Crippled, crushed, opened up like a fish for the gutting, still he had the power!\\n\\n \u0027\"Go to the kitchen,\" he commanded. \"A cleaver �C the big one - fetch it. Go now.\"\\n\\n \u0027His words released my limbs but his eyes - no, his mind - remained fastened on my mind. I went, throughgathering smoke and flame, and returned. I showed himthe cleaver and he nodded his satisfaction. The room was blazing now and my outer clothes were beginning tosmoke. All the hair of my head felt singed, crisped. \u0027\"Your reward,\" he said. \u0027\"I want no reward.\"\\n\\n \u0027\"But I want you to have it. I want you to know whoyou have destroyed this night. My shirt - tear it open at j the neck.\"\\n\\n \u0027I began to do so, and leaning over him thought for a single moment that something other than a tongue moved in the partly open cavern of his mouth. His breath in my face was a stench! I would have turned away but his eyes held me until the job was done. And around his neck on a chain of gold, there I found a heavy golden medallion. I unclasped it, took it, placed it in my pocket.\\n\\n \u0027\"There,\" he sighed. \"Payment in full. Now finish it.\"\\n\\n \u0027I lifted the cleaver in a trembling hand, but -\\n\\n \u0027\"Wait!\" he said. \"Listen: the temptation is on me to kill you. It is what you would call self-preservation, which runs strong in the Wamphyri. But I know it for false hope. The death you offer will be clean and merciful, the flames slow and intolerable. But for all that, still I might strike at you before you strike me, or even in the moment of the striking. And then both of us would die most horribly. Therefore... stay your blow until I close my eyes - then strike hard and true - then flee! Strike, and put distance between. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n \u0027I nodded.\\n\\n \u0027He closed his eyes.\\n\\n \u0027I struck!\\n\\n \u0027In the moment the straight, shiny blade bit into his neck - even before it passed through and the head was severed - his eyes shot open. But he had warned me, and I had taken note. As his head shot free and blood spurted from his body I leaped backward. The head bounced, rolled, fell among blazing books. But God help me, I swear that however it flew, at whichever angle, those awful eyes turned to follow me, full of accusation! And oh! - the mouth - his mouth and what it contained, that forked tongue, like a snake\u0027s, slithering and flickering over lips that drained in an instant from scarlet to deathly white!\\n\\n \u0027And as bad or worse than all of this, the head itself had changed. The skin had seemed to tighten on the skull, which in turn had elongated to that of a great hound or wolf. The glaring eyes, previously dark, had turned to the colour of blood. The upper teeth had clamped down on to the lower lip, trapping the scarlet forked tongue there, and the great incisors were curved and sharp as needles!\\n\\n \u0027It is true! I saw it. I saw it - but only in that moment before the whole head began a swift decomposition. It was the heat; it could only be that the flesh was blistering and melting; but the sheer horror of it sent me stumbling away from it. Stumbling, yes, and then leaping - away from that staring, alien rotting head, but likewise from his decapitated body - in which there had now commenced the most awful commotion! A commotion... and a collapse. My God, yes! Oh, yes...\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll recall I had lain my jacket across his exposed guts? Now the jacket was gripped by some invisible force from beneath, torn apart and tossed violently, in two pieces, to the ceiling. Following it, lashing wildly, a single tapering tentacle of leprous flesh burst upward from his stomach, twisting and writhing in a grim paroxysm. Like a devilish whip it thrashed the air of the room, snaking through the smoke and the flames as if searching!\\n\\n \u0027As the tentacle fell to the floor and began a systematic if spastic examination of the blazing room, only recoiling from the flames themselves, I stepped up on to a chair and crouched there transfixed with terror. And from that slightly elevated vantage point I saw what was left of the corpse falling in upon itself and becoming first putrefaction, then bones with the flesh sloughed off, finally dust before my eyes. As this happened the tentacle grew leaden, retracted, drew itself back to where the host body had lain, to the dust and the last crumbling relics of centuried bones...\\n\\n \u0027And all of this, you understand, taking place in mere moments, swifter far than I can possibly tell it. So that to this day I could not swear my soul on what I saw. Only that I believe I saw it.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, that was when the ceiling caved in and hurled me from my chair, and the entire area of the room where the horror had been burst into flames and hid whatever remained of it. But as I staggered from the place - and don\u0027t ask me how I got out again into the reeking night air, for that\u0027s gone now from my memory - there rose up from the inferno such a protracted cry of intense agony, so piteous and terrible and savagely angry a wailing, as ever I had heard and hope never to hear again.\\n\\n \u0027Then -\\n\\n \u0027The skies rained bombs once more and I knew nothing else until I regained consciousness in a field hospital. I had lost a leg, and, or so they later told me, something of my mind.
