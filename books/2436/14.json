{"id":78777,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"On Thursday morning Harry went back to the river, back to the place where his mother lay once more locked in mud and weed. Except that there were two of them there now, and he had not gone to talk to her but to Viktor Shukshin. He took a cushion from the car and carried it down to the river bank, putting it down in snow six inches deep before seating himself and hugging his knees. Below where he sat the ice had crusted over again and snow had settled on the place where he\u0027d cut his escape hole, so that only an outline showed through.\n After sitting in silence for a while, he said: \u0027Stepfather, can you hear me?\u0027\n \u0027...Yes,\u0027 came the answer in a little while. \u0027Yes, I can hear you, Harry Keogh. I hear you and I feel your presence! Why don\u0027t you go away and leave me in peace?\u0027\n \u0027Be careful, Stepfather. Mine might be the last voice you ever hear. If I \"go away and leave you in peace\", who\u0027ll speak to you then?\u0027\n \u0027So that\u0027s your talent, is it, Harry? You speak to the dead. You\u0027re a corpse rabble-rouser! Well, I want you to know that it hurts me, like all ESP hurts me. But last night, for the first time in many long years, I lay here in my freezing bed and slept soundly, and there was no pain. Who\u0027ll speak to me? I don\u0027t want anyone to speak to me! I want peace.\u0027\n \u0027What do you mean, it hurts you?\u0027 Harry pressed. \u0027How can my just being here hurt anything?\u0027\n Shukshin told him.\n \u0027And that\u0027s why you killed my mother?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, and it\u0027s why I tried to kill you. But in your case,\n it might also have served to save my own life.\u0027 And now he told Harry about the men Borowitz had sent to kill him, Dragosani and Batu.\n Harry wasn\u0027t satisfied. He wanted to know it all, from the beginning right to the present. Tell me about it,\u0027 he said, \u0027all of it, and I swear I won\u0027t bother you again.\u0027\n And so Shukshin told him.\n About Borowitz and the Chateau Bronnitsy. About the Russian ESPers where they worked for world conquest through ESP in their secret den in the heart of the USSR. He told of how Borowitz had sent him out of Russia to England to find and kill British ESPers, and how he had broken away and become a British citizen. And he told him again about the curse that dogged him: how ESP-talented people rubbed his nerves raw and brought on the madness in him. And at last Harry understood and might almost have pitied Shukshin - were it not for his mother.\n And as Shukshin talked so Harry thought of Sir Keenan Gormley and the British E-Branch, and he remembered his promise to go and see Gormley and perhaps join his group when all of this had been sorted out. Well, now it was sorted out. And now Harry knew that he must go and see Gormley. For Viktor Shukshin wasn\u0027t the only guilty one. There were others far worse than he could ever be. The one who had sent him out on his murderous mission in the first place, for instance. For if Shukshin had never come here, Harry\u0027s mother would still be alive.\n And at last Harry was satisfied. Until now his life had seemed greatly aimless, unfulfilled - his one ambition had been to kill Shukshin - but now he knew that it was bigger than that, and suddenly he felt small in view of the task which still awaited him.\n \u0027All right, Stepfather,\u0027 he finally said, I\u0027ll leave you now and let you rest. But it\u0027s a peace you don\u0027t deserve. I can\u0027t and won\u0027t forgive you.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t want your forgiveness, Harry Keogh, just your promise that you\u0027ll leave me alone here,\u0027 Shukshin told him. \u0027And you\u0027ve given me that. So now go and get yourself killed and let me be .. .\u0027\n Harry climbed stiffly to his feet. Every bone in his body ached - his head, too - and he felt completely sapped of strength. It was partly physical, but mostly emotional. It was the calm which follows on the storm, and, although he couldn\u0027t yet know it, it was also the lull before the greater storm still to come.\n But now he shrugged himself upright, left the cushion lying there forgotten in the snow, headed back towards his car. Behind him and yet with him a voice said in his mind: \u0027Goodbye, Harry.\u0027 But it wasn\u0027t Shukshin\u0027s voice.\n \u0027Goodbye, Ma,\u0027 he answered. \u0027And thanks. I\u0027ll always love you.\u0027\n \u0027And I\u0027ll always love you, Harry.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 now came Shukshin\u0027s horrified mental gasp. \u0027What! Keogh, what\u0027s this? I saw you raise her up, but - ?\u0027\n Harry didn\u0027t answer. He let Mary Keogh do it for him:\n \u0027Hello, Viktor. No, you\u0027re wrong. Harry didn\u0027t raise me up. I raised myself up. For the sake of love, which is something you can\u0027t understand. But that\u0027s over now and I\u0027ll not do it again. My Harry has others to look after him now; so I\u0027ll just lie here, lonely in the mud. Except maybe it won\u0027t be so lonely now...\u0027\n \u0027Keogh!\u0027 Shukshin frantically called out after Harry again. \u0027Keogh, you promised me - you said you were the only one who could talk to me. But now she is talking to me - and she hurts me most of all!\u0027\n Harry kept on walking.\n \u0027Now, now, Viktor,\u0027 he heard his mother\u0027s answer, as if she spoke to a small child. \u0027That will get you nowhere. Did you say you want peace and quiet? Oh, but you\u0027ll soon get bored with peace and quiet, Viktor.\u0027\n \u0027Keogh!\u0027 Shukshin\u0027s voice was a diminishing mental shriek now. \u0027Keogh, you have to get me out of this. Dig me up - tell them where to find my body - only don\u0027t leave me here with her!\u0027\n \u0027Actually, Viktor,\u0027 Mary Keogh remorselessly con\u0026shy;tinued, \u0027I think I\u0027ll rather enjoy talking to you. You\u0027re so close to me here that it\u0027s no effort at all!\u0027\n \u0027Keogh, you bastard! Come back! Oh ... please.... come... back!\u0027\n But Harry kept on walking.\n By 1:30 p.m. Harry was back in Hartlepool. The roads were nightmarish, layered with compacted snow for more than half the journey, so that in the main he was driving on his nerves. This only served to drain more of his strength, and when at last he got home it was as much as he could do to drag himself upstairs.\n Brenda, his wife of eight weeks, was bright and chirpy about the flat, which had undergone some fantastic and inexplicable metamorphosis since she had moved in after their registry office wedding. She was less than three months pregnant but already blooming. Harry, too, had been in fine fettle when last she had seen him; but now, in complete contrast -\n He barely managed the effort of kissing her on the cheek, was asleep almost before his head hit the pillows.\n He had been away for three days, doing \u0027research\u0027, she knew, for a new book he was planning - what and where exactly he\u0027d never bothered to say. Well, that was Harry and she should be used to it by now - but she was not used to him turning up looking like he\u0027d spent three days in a concentration camp!\n After he had slept right through the afternoon and seemed to have developed a fever, she called a doctor who visited at about 8:00 p.m. Harry didn\u0027t bother to wake up for his visit; the doctor thought it might be\n pneumonia, though the symptoms weren\u0027t quite right; he left pills, instructions and his telephone number. If Harry got worse during the night, especially if his breathing became irregular or he started coughing, or if his temperature went up appreciably, Brenda was to call him at once.\n But Harry got no worse through the night, and in the morning he was able to have a bite of breakfast, following which he engaged Brenda in a peculiar, guarded conversation which she was dismayed to find as depressing and morbid as any talk she\u0027d ever had with him during his gloomy or morose periods of previous, less happy times. After listening to him for a little while, when he began to talk about making a will leaving everything to her, or to their child in the event she was unable to make use of it, then she rounded on him and laughed out loud.\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 she said, taking his hands where he sat on the edge of the bed with his shoulders slumped, \u0027what is this all about? I know you\u0027ve had a bug of some sort or other and that you\u0027re still feeling low, and I know that when you\u0027re a bit down in the mouth it really seems like the end of the world to you, but here we are married for just eight weeks and you sound as if you expect to be dead by the spring! Yes, and me shortly after! I\u0027ve never heard anything so silly! Just a week ago you were swimming, fighting, skating, full of life - so what is it that\u0027s suddenly bothering you?\u0027\n At that he decided he really couldn\u0027t hedge any longer. Anyway she was his wife now and it was only right that she should know. And so he sat her down and told her everything, with the exception of his dream of the tombstones, and of course excluding the death of Viktor Shukshin. He passed off his aggressive \u0027exercising\u0027 of the past few months as simply a means of ensuring his fitness for work still to come, work which could well prove dangerous; which in turn led him to speak of the British ESP organisation, but not in any depth. It was sufficient\n she should know that he wasn\u0027t the only strangely talented person - that in fact there were many more - and that there were foreign powers ranged against the free world who were not above using such talents to its detriment. Part of Harry\u0027s work with the organisation would be to ensure that these alien powers failed in their objectives; his talent as a necroscope would be used as a weapon against them; the future therefore seemed at best... uncertain. His talk of wills and such had been simply an expression of this uncertainty: he thought it was best to be prepared for any eventuality.\n Even telling her all of this - and while not being too specific on any point - still he wondered if perhaps he was making a mistake, if it would have been better to keep her entirely in the dark. And he wondered at his own motives: was he really confiding in her in order to prepare her for ... for whatever? Or was it that she was right, that he was feeling at a low ebb and so needed someone to share the load?\n Or there again, was it guilt? He had a course to run now and must pursue it; the chase was not at an end; Shukshin had merely been a faltering step in the right direction. Did he feel that because he chose to go in that direction Brenda was at risk? The dream epitaph - his mother\u0027s warning - had said nothing about Brenda dying as a result of anything Harry was yet to do. He had impregnated her, yes, which would result in a birth; but how could any course he took now influence the physical event of the birth itself? And yet a nagging voice in the back of his mind told him that indeed it could.\n And so it seemed to him that his motive for telling her was chiefly one of guilt, and also because he needed to tell someone - needed to tell a friend. The trouble was that he seemed to be leaning on the very one he endangered, which aggravated and magnified the guilt aspect out of all proportion!\n It was all very confusing and abstruse, and trying to muddle through it made him more tired than ever, so that when he was done talking he was glad to sit back and let her think it over.\n Strangely, she accepted everything he said almost as a matter of course - indeed with visible relief - and at once set about to explain why:\n \u0027Harry, I know I\u0027m not as clever as you, but I\u0027m not stupid either. I\u0027ve known there was something in the air ever since you told me that story of yours - about the necroscope. I sort of sensed that you hadn\u0027t finished it, that you wanted to say more but you were scared to. Also, there\u0027ve been times up in Harden when Mr Hannant has stopped me and asked after you. The way he talked, I knew he thought there was something strange about you, too...\u0027\n \u0027Hannant?\u0027 he frowned suspiciously. \u0027What did he - ?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, nothing to be concerned about. In fact I think he\u0027s more than a little frightened of you. Harry, I\u0027ve listened to you talking to your poor dead Ma in your sleep, and I knew you were holding real conversations! And there were so many other things. Your writing, for instance. I mean, how come you were suddenly a brilliant author? I\u0027ve read your stories, Harry, and they\u0027re not you. Oh, they\u0027re wonderful stories, all right, but you just aren\u0027t that wonderful! Not the real you. The real you is ordinary, Harry. Oh, I love you - of course I do - but I\u0027m nobody\u0027s fool. And your swimming, your skating, your Judo? Did you think I\u0027d believe you were a super man? I promise you it\u0027s easier to believe you\u0027re a necroscope! It\u0027s a relief to know the truth, Harry. I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve finally told me...\u0027\n Harry shook his head in open astonishment. Talk about level-headed...!\n Finally he said: \u0027But I haven\u0027t told you everything, love.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I know that,\u0027 she answered. \u0027Of course you haven\u0027t! If you\u0027re to be working for your country, why obviously there\u0027ll be things you need to keep secret -even from me. I understand that, Harry.\u0027\n It was as if someone had lifted a great weight off his\n chest. He breathed deeply, lay back again, let his head\n link into his pillows. \u0027Brenda, I\u0027m still very tired,\u0027 he\n yawned. \u0027Just let me sleep now, there\u0027s a love. Tomorrow\n I\u0027m to go down to London.\u0027\n \u0027All right, my love,\u0027 she leaned over him to kiss his forehead. \u0027And don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t ask you to tell me a thing about it.\u0027\n Harry slept right through until evening, then got up and ate a meal. They went out about 8:00 p.m. just to walk for an hour in the crisp night air, until Brenda started to feel the cold. Then they hurried home, took hot showers, and made love, and afterwards both of them slept right through the night.\n It was the least Harry had done in any single day in his life.\n Later he would have reason to recall it as the most wasteful day in his life.\n Sir Keenan Gormley was thoughtful as he left ESP HQ, took the lift down to the tiny lobby and went out into the cold London night. Several things had given him cause for concern just recently, not the least of them being Harry Keogh. For Keogh had not yet contacted him, and with each day that passed Gormley felt the time weighing on him like lumps of lead. It was just after nine o\u0027clock as Gormley walked the streets heading for Westminster tube station, and two hundred and twenty-five miles away Harry Keogh himself was just making love to his wife before settling to a night\u0027s sleep.\n As for Gormley\u0027s other causes for concern: there were two of them. One was the way his second in command\n kept enquiring after his health, which might seem silly if his second in command weren\u0027t Alec Kyle, and if Alec Kyle wasn\u0027t a very talented seer, a man whose by no means negligible talent lay in foretelling the future! Kyle\u0027s concern for his boss over the last week or ten days had been pretty obvious, no matter how carefully he\u0027d tried to hide it. If there was anything specific, Gormley knew that Kyle would tell him. That was why he hadn\u0027t pressed him about it, but it was worrying anyway.\n And finally there was the other thing, the big thing. Over the period of the last six or seven weeks there had been at least a dozen different occasions when Gormley had known that there were ESPers about, when he\u0027d \u0027spotted\u0027 them in his mind. He had never come face to face with one, had never been able to pin one down, but he\u0027d known they were there anyway. At least two of them.\n It had got so he could recognise them almost as easily as he recognised his own men, but these were not his men. Their auras were strange. And always they watched him from the safety of crowds, in the busy places, never where he could tie a face to a feeling. He wondered how long they would go on watching, and if that was all they would do. And as he reached the underground and went down to the trains he patted the bulge of his 9 mm Browning through his overcoat and jacket. At least that was a comfort. There wasn\u0027t an ESPer in the world who could think himself out of the way of a bullet - not that Gormley knew of, anyway...\n There were only a few people on the platform and fewer in the compartment where Gormley picked up a discarded copy of the Daily Mail to keep him company during the journey. He found it mildly alarming that the headlines seemed completely alien to him. Was he really that much out of touch? Yes, he probably was! His work had been putting a lot of strain on him and taking up far\n too much of his time; this was the third night in a row he\u0027d worked late; he couldn\u0027t remember the last time he\u0027d really read a book right through or entertained friends. Maybe Kyle was right to be concerned about him - and on a purely personal level at that - not from the point of view of an ESPer. Maybe it was time he took a break and left his second in command to mind the shop. God only knew he would have to sooner or later. And he made himself a promise that he would take a break... just as soon as he\u0027d initiated young Harry Keogh into the fold.\n Keogh...\n Gormley had given a lot of thought to Keogh, had considered some of the ways his talent might be put to use. Fantastic ways. All in the mind for now, but fascinat\u0026shy;ing anyway. He would have started to go over them again, but just as it crossed his mind to do so the train pulled into St James\u0027s and Gormley found himself distracted by an incredibly pretty pair of legs in a tiny skirt that passed directly in front of his eyes and out of the twin doors. It was a wonder the lovely creature didn\u0027t freeze to death, he thought - and wouldn\u0027t that be a loss!\n Gormley grinned at his own thoughts. His wife, God bless her, was always complaining he had an eye for the girls. Well, his heart might be tricky but the rest of him seemed to be in working order. An eye wouldn\u0027t be all he had for that young lady, if he were thirty years younger!\n He coughed loudly, returned to his newspaper and tried to get himself reacquainted with the world. A brave effort but he lost interest half-way down the second column. It was pretty mundane stuff, after all, compared with his world. A world of fortune-tellers, telepaths, and now a necroscope.\n Harry Keogh again.\n There was a game Gormley played with Kyle. It was a\n word-association game. Sometimes it startled Kyle\u0027s future-oriented mind into action, opening a window for him. A window on tomorrow. Normally Kyle\u0027s talent worked independent of conscious thought; he usually \u0027dreamed\u0027 his predictions; if he consciously tried for results they wouldn\u0027t come. But if you could catch him unawares...\n They had played their game just a few days ago. Gormley had had Keogh on his mind and had wandered into Kyle\u0027s office. And seeing the ESPer sitting there he\u0027d smiled and said: \u0027Game?\u0027\n Kyle had understood. \u0027Go right ahead.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a name,\u0027 Gormley had warned, to which Kyle had nodded his head.\n \u0027I\u0027m ready,\u0027 he\u0027d said, sitting up and putting down whatever he was working on.\n Gormley paced a while, then turned quickly and faced the other where he sat at his desk. \u0027Harry Keogh!\u0027 he had snapped then.\n \u0027Mobius!\u0027 answered Kyle at once.\n \u0027Maths?\u0027 Gormley frowned.\n \u0027Space-time!\u0027 Now Kyle went white, scared-looking, and Gormley had known they\u0027d got something. He gave it one last shot:\n \u0027Necroscope!\u0027\n \u0027Necromancer!\u0027 the other shot back at once.\n \u0027What? Necromancer?\u0027 Gormley had repeated. But Kyle was still working.\n \u0027Vampire!\u0027 he\u0027d shouted then, starting to his feet. Then he was swaying, trembling, shaking his head, saying, \u0027That... that\u0027s enough, sir. Whatever it was, it ... it\u0027s gone now.\u0027\n And that had been that...\n Gormley came back to the present.\n He looked up and found they\u0027d passed through Victoria and that the train was almost empty. Already they were\n mid-way to Sloane Square. And that was when he began to feel a strange depression settling over him.\n He felt that there was something wrong but he couldn\u0027t just put his finger on it. It might simply be the train\u0027s emptiness (which even at this hour was a rare enough occurrence in itself) and that he missed the bustle of life and contact with other human beings, but he didn\u0027t think so. Then, as the train pulled into the station he knew what it was: it was his talent working.\n The doors sighed open and a middle-aged couple got out, leaving Gormley quite alone, but just before the doors hissed shut again two men got in - and their ESP-aura washed over him like a wave of icy water! Yes, and now he could put faces to feelings.\n Dragosani and Batu sat directly opposite their quarry, stared straight at him with cold, expressionless faces. They made a strange pair, he thought, not designed with any degree of compatibility. Not outwardly, anyway. The taller one leaned forward, his sunken eyes reminding Gormley yet again of Harry Keogh. Yes, they were like Keogh\u0027s eyes in a way, probably in their colour and intelligence. And that was especially strange, for set in this face one got the impression that by rights they should be feral or even red, and that the intelligence behind them was barely human at all but that of a beast.\n \u0027You know what we are, Sir Keenan,\u0027 the stranger said in a voice deep as it was dark, whose Russian accent he made no attempt to disguise, \u0027if not who we are. And we know who and what you are. Therefore it would be childish simply to sit here and pretend that we were ignorant of each other. Don\u0027t you agree?\u0027\n \u0027Your logic leaves little room for argument,\u0027 Gormley nodded, imagining that his blood was already beginning to cool in his veins.\n \"Then let us continue to be logical,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027If we wanted you dead, you would be dead. We have not\n lacked the opportunity, as I\u0027m sure you know. And so, when we leave the train at South Kensington, you will not attempt to run or make a fuss, or bring unnecessary attention to yourself or to us. If you do, then we will be forced to kill you and that would be unfortunate, of benefit to no one. Is this understood and agreed?\u0027\n Gormley forced himself to remain calm, raised an eyebrow and said: \u0027You\u0027re very sure of yourself, Mr er - ?\u0027\n \u0027Dragosani,\u0027 said the other at once. \u0027Boris Dragosani. Yes, I am very sure of myself. As is my friend here, Max Batu.\u0027\n \u0027 - For a stranger in this country, I was about to say,\u0027 Gormley continued. \u0027It seems to me that I\u0027m about to be kidnapped. But are you sure you know all you need to know about my habits? Mightn\u0027t there be something you\u0027ve overlooked? Something your logic hasn\u0027t taken into account?\u0027 He quickly, nervously took out a cigarette lighter from his right-hand overcoat pocket and placed it in his lap, patted his pockets as if he searched for a packet of cigarettes, finally started to reach inside his overcoat.\n \u0027No!\u0027 said Dragosani warningly. As if from nowhere he produced his own weapon and held it before him at arm\u0027s length, pointing it directly into Gormley\u0027s face, so that the older man looked straight down the rifled barrel of the stubby black silencer. \u0027No, nothing has been overlooked. Max, could you see to that, please?\u0027\n Batu got up, eased himself on to the seat next to Gormley, drew the other\u0027s hand slowly back into the open and took the Browning from Gormley\u0027s trembling fingers. The safety catch was still on. Batu released the magazine and pocketed it, gave the automatic back to Gormley.\n \u0027Nothing at all,\u0027 Dragosani continued. \u0027Unfortunately, however, that was the last wrong move you\u0027ll be allowed\n to make.\u0027 He put away his gun, folded his slim fingers into his lap. His posture was unnatural, Gormley decided: very sinuous, almost feline, very nearly female. He didn\u0027t know what to make of Dragosani at all.\n \u0027Any more heroics,\u0027 Dragosani continued, \u0027will result in your death - immediately!\u0027 And Gormley knew he wasn\u0027t bluffing.\n Carefully, he pushed the useless automatic back into its holster, said: \u0027What is it you want with me?\u0027\n \u0027We want to talk to you,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027I wish to ... to put some questions to you.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve had questions put to me before,\u0027 Gormley answered, forcing a tight smile. \u0027I imagine they\u0027ll be very searching questions, eh?\u0027\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Dragosani. Now he smiled, and it was ghastly. Gormley felt physically repulsed. His man\u0027s mouth gaped like a panting dog\u0027s, where elongated teeth gleamed sharply white. \u0027Ah, no. There\u0027ll be no bright lights in your eyes, Sir Keenan, if that\u0027s what you mean,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027No drugs. No pincers. No hose to fill your belly with water. Oh, no, nothing like that. But you will tell me everything I want to know, of that I can assure you...\u0027\n The train was slowing as it pulled into South Kensington. Gormley\u0027s heart gave a little lurch in his chest. So close to home, and yet so far. Dragosani had a light overcoat folded over his arm. He showed Gormley the silencer of his weapon, let it peep out of the folds of the overcoat for a moment, and reminded him: \u0027No heroics.\u0027\n There was a handful of people on the platform: young people mainly, and a pair of down-and-outs with a bottle in a paper bag between them. Even if Gormley looked for help, he couldn\u0027t find much here. \u0027Just leave the station by the same route you take every night,\u0027 said Dragosani at Gormley\u0027s shoulder.\n Gormley\u0027s heart was hammering now. He knew full\n well that if he went with these men it was all up with him. He was an older hand at this game than the two foreign agents. When Dragosani had told him his and his squat little companion\u0027s names, that had been as good as saying: \u0027But it won\u0027t do you any good, for you won\u0027t be around to tell anyone!\u0027 And so he must escape from them - but how?\n They left the underground onto Pelham Street, walked down the Brompton Road to Queen\u0027s Gate. \u0027I cross here, at the lights,\u0027 Gormley said. But as they reached the parking lanes straddling the central reservation Dragosani\u0027s grip tightened on his arm.\n \u0027We have a car here,\u0027 he said, drawing Gormley to the right and along the line of parked vehicles towards an anonymous-looking Ford. Dragosani had bought the car second-hand (tenth-hand, he suspected) and cash down, no questions asked. It would last only as long as his and Max Batu\u0027s visit. Then it would be found burned-out in some suburban lane. But it was then, as they approached the car, that Gormley saw his chance.\n Not twenty-five yards away a police patrol car pulled into an empty space and a uniformed constable got out and began checking the doors of the parked cars. A routine check, Gormley guessed. Or more properly, where he was concerned, a miracle!\n Dragosani felt the sudden tension in Gormley, sensed his move before he could begin to make it. Batu had just opened the nearside front and rear doors of the Ford, was turning back towards Dragosani and Gormley, when his partner hissed: \u0027Now, Max!\u0027\n Unprepared, still Batu instantly adopted his killing crouch, his moon face undergoing its monstrous metamorphosis. Dragosani maintained his grip on Gormley, looked away at the last moment. Gormley had opened his mouth to yell for help, but all that came out was a croak. He saw Batu\u0027s face silhouetted against the night,\n and one eye which was a yellow slit while the other was round and green and throbbing as if filled with sentient pus! Something passed from that face to Gormley as fast as the thrust of a mental knife; its razor edge located his spirit, his very soul, and opened them up! Except for what little traffic passed in the street, all was quiet, and yet Gormley heard the cacophonic gonging of some great cracked bell from deep inside himself, and knew it was his heart.\n With that it should have been finished, but not quite. Thrown backward by the shock of Batu\u0027s awful power, Gormley slammed loudly against the wing of a car parked behind the Ford. Along the street the constable\u0027s face turned enquiringly in their direction as a second police\u0026shy;man got out of the patrol car. Worse, another vehicle, a blue Porsche, pulled in with a screech of brakes, its headlights dazzling where they picked the three figures out and pinned them against the darkness. In another moment the Porsche seemed to eject a tall young man into the street, his strong face concerned as he grabbed hold of Gormley to steady him.\n \u0027Uncle?\u0027 he said, staring into the other\u0027s bulging eyes, his blue face. \u0027My God! It must be his heart!\u0027 The two policemen were already hurrying to see what was happening.\n Dragosani found himself almost paralysed by the changing situation. Everything was going wrong. He made an effort to regain control, whispered to Max Batu: \u0027Get into the car!\u0027 Then he turned to the stranger. By now the policemen were on hand, offering assistance.\n \u0027What happened here?\u0027 one of them asked.\n Dragosani thought fast. \u0027We saw him stumble,\u0027 he said. \u0027I thought maybe he was drunk. Anyway, I went to help, asked if there was anything I could do. He said something about his heart...? I was about to take him to a hospital, but then this gentleman arrived and - \u0027\n Tm Arthur Banks,\u0027 said the man in question. \u0027This is Sir Keenan Gormley, my uncle. I was on my way to meet him at the station when I saw him with these two. But look, this isn\u0027t the time or place for explanations. He has a bad heart. We have to get him to a hospital. And I mean right now!\u0027\n The policemen were galvanised into action. One of them said to Dragosani: \u0027Perhaps you\u0027ll give us a ring later, sir? Just so we can get a few more details? Thanks.\u0027 He helped Banks get his uncle into the Porsche while his driver ran back to the patrol car and got the blue light going. Then, as Banks pulled away from the kerb and swung the Porsche around in a screeching half circle, the constable yelled: \u0027Just follow us, sir. We\u0027ll have him under care in two shakes!\u0027\n A moment later and he had joined his colleague in the patrol vehicle, by which time the siren was blaring its dee-dah, dee-dah warning to traffic. In a sort of numb disbelief Dragosani watched as the two cars moved off in tandem. He watched them out of sight, then slowly, unsteadily got into the Ford and sat there beside Batu trembling with rage. The door was still open. Finally Dragosani grabbed its handle and slammed it shut, slammed it so hard that it almost sprang from its fixings.\n \u0027Damn!\u0027 he snarled. \u0027Damn the British, Sir Keenan Gormley, his nephew, their bloody oh-so-civilised police - everything!\u0027\n \u0027Things are not going well,\u0027 Max Batu agreed.\n \u0027And damn you, too!\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027You and your bloody evil eye! You didn\u0027t kill him!\u0027\n \u0027Allow me to know my business,\u0027 Batu quietly answered. \u0027I killed him all right. I felt it. It was like crushing a bug.\u0027\n Dragosani started the engine, pulled away. \u0027I saw him looking at me, I tell you! He\u0027ll talk...\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Batu shook his head. \u0027He won\u0027t have strength for\n talking. He\u0027s a dead man, Comrade, take my word for it At this very moment, a dead man.\u0027\n And in the Porsche, suddenly Gormley choked out a single word - \u0027Dragosani!\u0027 which meant nothing at all to his horrified nephew - and slumped down in his seat with spittle dribbling from the corner of his mouth.\n Max Batu was right: he was dead on arrival.\n Harry Keogh arrived at Gormley\u0027s house in South Kensington at about 3:00 p.m. the following day. Meanwhile Arthur Banks had been a very busy man. It seemed a year but in fact it was only yesterday when he\u0027d driven up from Chichester with his wife, Gormley\u0027s daughter, on a flying visit. Then there had been his uncle\u0027s heart attack, since when the entire world seemed to have gone stark, staring mad! And horribly so.\n First there had been the awful business of phoning his aunt, Jacqueline Gormley, from the hospital and telling her what had happened; then her breakdown when she arrived at the hospital; and her daughter consoling her all through the long night, when she had broken her heart as she wandered to and fro through the house looking for her husband. This morning she\u0027d stayed at the house until they brought Sir Keenan from the hospital morgue. The mortician there had done a pretty good job with him, but still the old man\u0027s face had been twisted in a dreadful rictus. Funeral arrangements were swift - that was the way Gormley had always said he would want it: a cremation tomorrow - until when he would lie in state at his home. Jackie couldn\u0027t stay there, however, not with him looking like that. Why, it didn\u0027t look like him at all! So she had had to be taken to her brother\u0027s place on the other side of London. That, too, had been Banks\u0027 job; and finally he had driven his wife to Waterloo so that she could go back to Chichester to the children. She\u0027d be back for the funeral. Until then he was stuck at the house\n on his own, or rather in the company of his dead uncle. Aunt Jackie had made him promise he wouldn\u0027t leave Sir Keenan on his own, and of course he hadn\u0027t refused her that.\n But when he got back to the house after putting his wife on the Chichester train -\n That had been the worst of all. It had been - mindless! Ghoulish! Unbelievable! And for all that it had been fifteen minutes ago, he was still reeling, still sick, numb to his brain with shock and horror, when Harry Keogh\u0027s ring at the doorbell took him staggering to the front door.\n Tin Harry Keogh,\u0027 said the young man on the door step. \u0027Sir Keenan Gormley asked me to come and see -\u0027\n \u0027H-help!\u0027 Banks whispered, choking the word out as if there was no wind in him, as if all the spit had dried up in him. \u0027God, Jesus Christ! - whoever you are - h-help me!\u0027\n Harry looked at him in amazement, grabbed him in order to hold him up. \u0027What is it? What\u0027s happened? This is Sir Keenan Gormley\u0027s house, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n The other nodded. He was slowly turning green, about to throw up - again - at any moment. \u0027C-come in. He\u0027s in ... in there. In the living-room, of all bloody places -but don\u0027t go in there. I have to ... have to call the police. Somebody has to, anyway!\u0027 His legs began to buckle and Harry thought he would fall. Before that could happen he pushed him backwards and down into a chair in the lobby. Then he crouched down beside him and shook him.\n \u0027Is it Sir Keenan? What\u0027s happened to him?\u0027\n Even before the answer came, Harry knew.\n Soon to die in agony. First and foremost a patriot.\n Banks looked up, stared at Harry from a green-tinged face. \u0027Did you... did you work for him?\u0027\n \u0027I was going to.\u0027\n Banks baulked, burst to his feet, staggered to a tiny\n room to one side of the lobby. \u0027He died last night,\u0027 he managed to gulp the words out. \u0027A heart attack. He was to be cremated tomorrow. But now - \u0027 He yanked open the door and the odour of fresh vomit welled out. The room was a toilet and it was obvious that he\u0027d already used it.\n Harry turned his face away, grabbed a mouthful of fresh air from the open front door before quietly closing it. Then he left Banks retching and walked through into the living-room - and saw for himself what was wrong with Banks.\n And what was wrong with Sir Keenan Gormley.\n A heart attack, Banks had said. One look at the room told Harry there\u0027d been an attack, all right, but what sort didn\u0027t bear thinking about. He fought down the bile which at once rose up and threatened to swamp him, went back to Banks where he crouched weakly at the bowl of the toilet in the small room. \u0027Call the police when you can,\u0027 he said. \u0027Sir Keenan\u0027s office, too, if anyone\u0027s on duty there. I\u0027m sure he would want them to know about... this. I\u0027ll stay here with you - with him -for a little while.\u0027\n \u0027Th-thanks,\u0027 said Banks, without looking up. \u0027I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t be more help right now. But when I came in and found him like that...\u0027\n \u0027I understand,\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027I\u0027ll be OK in a minute. I\u0027m working on it.\u0027\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\n Harry went back to the other room. He saw everything, began to catalogue the horror, then stopped. What stopped him was this: a Queen Anne chair with claw feet lay on its side on the floor. One of its wooden legs was broken off just below the platform of the seat. Embedded in the club-like foot was a tooth; other teeth, wrenched out, lay scattered on the floor; the mouth of the corpse\n had been forced open and now gaped like a black shaft in \u0027 the wildly distorted, frozen grimace of the face!\n Harry gropingly found himself a seat - another chair, but one free of debris - and collapsed into it. He closed his eyes, pictured the room as it must have looked before this. Sir Keenan in his coffin on an oak table draped in black, rose-scented candles burning at head and feet. And then, as he lay here alone, the... intrusion.\n But why?\n \u0027Why, Keenan?\u0027 he asked.\n \u0027Noooo! No, keep off!\u0027 came the answer at once, causing Harry to rock back in his chair with its force, its fear, its freezing terror. \u0027Dragosani, you monster! No more - for God\u0027s sake have pity, man!\u0027\n \u0027Dragosani?\u0027 Harry reached out soothing mental fingers. \u0027This isn\u0027t Dragosani, Keenan. It\u0027s me, Harry Keogh.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 the single word was a gasp in his mind. \u0027Keogh? Harry?\u0027 Then a sigh, a sob of relief. \u0027Thank God! Thank God it\u0027s you, Harry, and not... not him!\u0027\n \u0027Was this Dragosani?\u0027 Harry gritted his teeth. \u0027But why? Is he insane? He would have to be totally - \u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Gormley\u0027s vigorous denial cut him off. \u0027Oh, he is crazy, of course he is - but crazy like a fox! And his talent is ... hideous!\u0027\n Suddenly the answer - or what he thought was the answer - came to Keogh in a flash. He felt the blood draining from him. \u0027He came to you after you died!\u0027 he gasped. \u0027He\u0027s like me, a necroscope.\u0027\n \u0027No, absolutely not!\u0027 again Gormley\u0027s denial. \u0027Not like you at all, Harry. I\u0027m talking to you because I want to. All of ... of us, talk to you. You\u0027re the bringer of warmth, of peace. You\u0027re contact with the dream that went before and which now has faded. You\u0027re a chance -the one last chance - that something worthwhile might\n linger over, might even be passed on. A light in the darkness, Harry, that\u0027s what you are. But Dragosani -\u0027\n \u0027What is his talent?\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s a necromancer - and that\u0027s a different thing entirely!\u0027\n Harry opened his eyes a crack and glanced once more at the state of the room. But as the horror welled up again he closed his eyes and said: \u0027But this is the work of a ghoul!\u0027\n That and worse,\u0027 Gormley shuddered, and Harry felt it - felt the dead man\u0027s shudder of absolute terror shaking his spirit. \u0027He ... he doesn\u0027t just talk, Harry, he doesn\u0027t ask. Doesn\u0027t even try. He just reaches in and takes, steals. You can\u0027t hide anything from him. He finds his answers in your blood, your guts, in the marrow of your very bones. The dead can\u0027t feel pain, Harry, or they shouldn\u0027t. But that\u0027s part of his talent, too. When Boris Dragosani works, he makes us feel it. I felt his knives, his hands, his tearing nails. I knew everything he did, and all of it was hell! After one minute I would have told him everything, but that\u0027s not his way, it\u0027s not his art. How could he be sure I told the truth? But his way he knows it\u0027s the truth! It\u0027s written in skin and muscle, in ligaments and tendons and corpuscles. He can read it in brain fluid, in the mucus of the eye and ear, in the texture of the dead tissue itself!\u0027\n Harry kept his eyes closed, shook his head, felt sick and dizzy and totally disoriented, as if this were all happening to someone else. At last he said: \u0027This can\u0027t -mustn\u0027t - happen again. He has to be stopped. I have to stop him. But I can\u0027t do it alone.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes, he has to be stopped, Harry. Especially now. You see, he took everything. He knows it all. He knows our strengths, our weaknesses, and all of it is knowledge he can use. Him and his master, Gregor Borowitz. And you may well be the only one who can stop him.\u0027\n With another part of his awareness, Harry heard Banks on the telephone in the lobby. Time was now short, and there was so much Gormley must tell him. \u0027Listen, Keenan. We have to hurry now. I\u0027ll stay with you a little while longer, and then I\u0027ll find a hotel in the city. But if I stay here now the police will want to talk to me. Anyway, I\u0027ll find a place and from now until you - \u0027 he realised what he had almost said and bit the words off unspoken, but not unvisioned.\n \u0027 - Until I\u0027m cremated, yes,\u0027 said Gormley, and Harry could picture him nodding understandingly. \u0027It was to have been soon, but now it will probably be delayed.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll stay in touch,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027There\u0027s still a lot I don\u0027t know. About our organisation, theirs, how to go about tracking them down. Many things.\u0027\n \u0027Do you know about Batu?\u0027 again Gormley\u0027s fear was apparent. \u0027The little Mongol, Harry - do you know about him?\u0027\n \u0027I know he\u0027s one of them, but - \u0027 \u0027He has the evil eye - he can kill with a glance! My heart attack - he brought it on. He killed me, Harry, Max Batu. That face of his, that evil eye, it generates mental poison! His power bites like acid, melts the brain, the heart. He killed me...\u0027\n \u0027Then he\u0027s another I have to settle with,\u0027 Harry answered, cold determination stiffening his resolve. \u0027But be careful, Harry.\u0027 \u0027I will.\u0027\n \u0027I think the answers are in you, my boy, and God only knows how much I pray you can find them. Just let me give you this warning: when Dragosani was... with me, I sensed something else in him. It wasn\u0027t just his necromancy. Harry, there\u0027s an evil in that man that\u0027s older than time! With him loose in the world nothing, no one is safe. Not even the people who think they control him.\u0027\n Harry nodded. \u0027I\u0027ll be watching out for him,\u0027 he said. \u0027And I\u0027ll find the answers, Keenan, all of them. With your help. For as long as you can give me that help, anyway.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve thought about that, Harry,\u0027 said the other. \u0027And you know, I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll be the end. I mean, this isn\u0027t me. What you see here used to be me, it was me - but so was a baby born in South Africa, and so was a young man who joined the British Army when he was seventeen, and so was the head of E-Branch for thirteen years. They\u0027ve all gone now, and after my funeral pyre this part will also be gone. But me, I\u0027ll still be here. Somewhere.\u0027\n \u0027I hope so,\u0027 said Harry, opening his eyes and standing up, and avoiding looking at the room.\n \u0027Find yourself a hotel, then,\u0027 said Gormley, \u0027and get back to me when you can. The sooner we get started the better. And afterwards - I mean when all of this is over and done, if it ever is -\u0027\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\n \u0027Well, it would be nice if you could look me up some time. You see, unless I\u0027m mistaken, you\u0027re the only one who\u0027ll ever be able to. And you know you\u0027ll always be welcome.\u0027\n An hour later Harry locked himself in his cheap hotel room and got in touch with Gormley again. As always, having already been in contact with him, it came very easy. The ex-boss of E-Branch was waiting for him, had been considering what to tell him and gave the information in order of priority. They started with E-Branch itself - a deeper view of the branch and the people who worked in it - and went on to the reasons why at this stage Harry should not approach Gormley\u0027s second in command or in any way attempt entry into the organisation.\n \u0027It would be too time-consuming,\u0027 Gormley explained. \u0027Oh, there would be benefits, of course. For one thing you\u0027d be funded - any necessary expenses would be covered - but at the same time they\u0027d want to give you a good close going-over. And naturally they\u0027d be eager to test your talent. Especially now that I\u0027m gone, and when it comes out what someone has done to my corpse...\u0027\n \u0027You think I\u0027d be suspect?\u0027\n \u0027What, a necroscope? Of course you\u0027d be suspect! I do have a file on you, true, but it\u0027s pretty sketchy and obviously incomplete - and actually I\u0027m the only one who could have vouched for you! So you see, by the time our side had cleared you the other side would have raced ahead. Time is of the essence, Harry, and not to be wasted. So what I propose is this: you won\u0027t attempt to join E-Branch right now but work on your own. After all, the only ones who know anything at all about you at this time are Dragosani and Batu. The trouble with that, of course, is that Dragosani knows everything about you, for he stole it directly from me! What we must ask ourselves is this: why did Borowitz send these two here? Why now? What\u0027s brewing? Or is he just stretching his tentacles a bit? Oh, he\u0027s had agents here before, certainly, but they were only intelligence gatherers. They were enemy, and they sought information - but they weren\u0027t killers! So what has happened that Borowitz has decided to turn a cold ESP war into a hot one?\u0027\n Harry told him about Shukshin, gave him a brief overview of things as he saw and understood them.\n Gormley\u0027s thoughts were wry indeed when he answered: \u0027So you\u0027ve been working for us for some time, it appears! What a pity I didn\u0027t know all of this that time I came to see you. We could have done the job that much more quickly. Shukshin might have been import-\n ant to you, Harry, but in reality he was very small fry. We might even have been able to use him.\u0027\n \u0027I wanted him for myself,\u0027 said Harry viciously. \u0027I wanted him used up! Anyway, I didn\u0027t know there was any connection. I only found that out after I killed him. But that\u0027s done with and now we have to get on. So ... you want me to work on my own. But there\u0027s the rub: see, I don\u0027t have the foggiest idea of how to be an agent! I know what I want to do: I have to kill Dragosani, Batu, Borowitz. That is my priority - but I can\u0027t even begin to think how to go about it.\u0027\n Gormley seemed to understand his problem. That\u0027s the difference between espionage and ESPionage, Harry. We all understand the first. All the cloak-and-daggery, the thud-and-blundering, the DTB - or Dirty Tricks Brigade - it\u0027s all old hat. But none of us really knows a lot about the second. You do what your talent tells you to do. You find the best possible ways to use it. That\u0027s all any of us can do. For some of us it\u0027s easy: we don\u0027t have sufficient talent to worry about, we can\u0027t expand it. Myself, for example. I can spot another ESPer a mile away; but that\u0027s it, end of story. In your case, however -\u0027\n Harry began to grow frustrated. His task seemed huge, impossible. He was oneman, one mind, one barely mature talent. What could he do?\n Gormley picked him up on that: \u0027You weren\u0027t listening, Harry. I said you have to find the best way to use your talent. Until now you haven\u0027t been doing that. Let\u0027s face it, what have you achieved?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve talked to the dead!\u0027 Harry snapped. \"That\u0027s it, it\u0027s what I do. I\u0027m a necroscope.\u0027\n Gormley was patient. \u0027You\u0027ve scratched the surface, Harry, and that\u0027s all. Look, you\u0027ve written the stories a dead man couldn\u0027t finish. You\u0027ve used the formulae\n that a mathematician never had time to develop in life. Dead men have taught you how to drive, how to speak Russian and German. They\u0027ve improved your swimming and your fighting and one or two other things. But what do you personally reckon all of this amounts to?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing!\u0027 Harry answered, after only a moment\u0027s thought.\n \u0027Right, nothing. Because you\u0027ve been talking to the wrong people. You\u0027ve been letting your talent guide you, instead of you guiding your talent. Now I know these are probably bad examples, but you\u0027re like a hypnotist who can only hypnotise himself, or a clairvoyant who forecasts his own death - for tomorrow! You have a ground-breaking talent, but you\u0027re not breaking any ground. The problem is that you\u0027re entirely self-taught. So in a way you\u0027re ignorant: like a heathen at a banquet, stuffing yourself full of everything and savouring none of it. And not recognising the good stuff because of the way it\u0027s dressed up. But if I\u0027m right you had the answer at your fingertips way back when you were a kid. Except your kid\u0027s mind failed to see the possibilities. But you\u0027re a man now and the possibilities should be starting to make themselves obvious. Not obvious to me but to you! After all, it\u0027s your talent. You have to learn how best to use it, that\u0027s all...\u0027\n What Gormley said made sense and Harry knew it. \u0027But where do I start?\u0027 He was desperate.\n \u0027I have what might just be a clue for you,\u0027 Gormley was careful not to be too optimistic. \u0027The result of an ESP game I used to play with Alec Kyle, my second in command. I didn\u0027t mention it before because there might not be anything in it, but if we have to have a starting point - \u0027\n \u0027Go on,\u0027 said Harry.\n And with his mind, Gormley drew him this mental picture:\n \u0027What the hell\u0027s that?\u0027 Harry was nonplussed.\n \u0027It\u0027s a Mobius strip,\u0027 said Gormley. \u0027Named after its inventor, August Ferdinand Mobius, a German mathematician. Just take a thin strip of paper, give it a half-twist and join up the ends. It reduces a two-dimensional surface to only one. It has many impli\u0026shy;cations, I\u0027m told, but I wouldn\u0027t know for I\u0027m not a mathematician.\u0027\n Harry was still baffled, not by the principle but by its application. \u0027And this is supposed to have something to do with me?\u0027\n \u0027With your future - your immediate future - possibly,\u0027 Gormley was deliberately vague. \u0027I told you there mightn\u0027t be anything in it. Anyway, let me tell you what happened.\u0027 He told Harry about his and Kyle\u0027s word-association game. \u0027So I started off with your name, Harry Keogh, and Kyle came back with \"Mobius\". I said, \"Maths?\" - and he answered, \"Space-time\"!\u0027\n \u0027Space-time?\u0027 Harry was at once interested. \u0027Now that might well fit in with this Mobius strip thing. It seems to me that the strip is only a diagram of warped space, and space and time are inextricably linked.\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 said Gormley, and Harry pictured his surprised expression. \u0027And is that an original thought, Harry, or do you have... outside help?\u0027\n This gave Harry an idea. \u0027Wait,\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t know your Mobius, but I do know someone else.\u0027 He got in touch with James Gordon Hannant in the cemetery in Harden, showed him the strip.\n \u0027Sorry, can\u0027t help you, Harry,\u0027 said Hannant, his thoughts clipped and precise as ever. \u0027I\u0027ve gone in an entirely different direction. I was never into curves anyway. By that I mean that my maths was - is - all very practical. Different but practical. But of course you know that. If it can be done on paper, I can probably do it; I\u0027m more visual, if you like, than Mobius. A lot of his stuff was in the mind, abstract, theoretical. Now if only he and Einstein could have got together, then we really might have seen something!\u0027\n \u0027But I have to know about this!\u0027 Harry was desperate. \u0027Can\u0027t you suggest anything?\u0027\n Hannant sensed Harry\u0027s urgency, raised a mental eyebrow. In that emotionless, calculating fashion of his, he said: \u0027But isn\u0027t the answer obvious, Harry? Why don\u0027t you ask him, Mobius himself? After all, you\u0027re the only one who can...\u0027\n Suddenly excited, Harry crossed back to Gormley. \u0027Well,\u0027 he told him, \u0027at least I have a place to start now. What else came out of this game of yours with Alec Kyle?\u0027\n \u0027After he came up with \"Space-time\" I tried him with \"necroscope\",\u0027 said Gormley. \u0027He immediately came back with \"necromancer\".\u0027\n Harry was silent for a moment, then said:\u0027So it\n looks like he was reading your future as well as mine....\u0027\n \u0027I suppose so,\u0027 Gormley answered. \u0027But then he said something that\u0027s got me stumped even now. I mean -even assuming that all we\u0027ve just mentioned is somehow connected - what on earth am I supposed to make of \"vampire\", eh?\u0027\n Cold fingers crept up Harry\u0027s spine. What indeed? Finally he said:\n \u0027Keenan, can we stop there? I\u0027ll get back to you as soon as possible, but right now there are one or two things I have to do. I want to give my wife a call, find a reference library, check some things out. And I want to go and see Mobius, so I\u0027ll probably be booking a flight to Germany. Also, I\u0027m hungry! And ... I want to think about things. Alone, I mean.\u0027\n \u0027I understand, Harry, and I\u0027ll be ready when you want to start again. But by all means see to your own needs first. Let\u0027s face it, they have to be greater than mine. So go ahead, son. You see to the living. The dead have plenty of time.\u0027\n \u0027Also,\u0027 Harry told him, \u0027there\u0027s someone else I want to speak to - but that\u0027s my secret for now.\u0027\n Gormley was suddenly worried for him. \u0027Don\u0027t do anything rash, Harry. I mean - \u0027\n \u0027You said I should go it alone, do it my way,\u0027 Harry reminded him.\n He sensed Gormley\u0027s nod of acquiescence. That\u0027s right, son. Let\u0027s just hope you do it right, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n Which was one sentiment Harry could only agree with.\n Late that same evening, at the Russian Embassy Dragosani and Batu had finished their packing and were looking forward to their morning flight out. Dragosani had not yet started to commit his knowledge to paper; this was the last place for that sort of undertaking. One might as well write a letter direct to Yuri Andropov himself!\n The two Russian agents had rooms with a linking door and only one telephone, which was situated in Batu\u0027s apartment. The necromancer had just stretched himself out on his bed, lost in his own strange, dark\n thoughts, when he heard the phone ring in Batu\u0027s room. A moment later and the squat little Mongol knocked on the joining door. \u0027It\u0027s for you,\u0027 his muffled voice came through the stained, dingy oak panels. The switchboard. Something about a call from outside.\u0027\n Dragosani got up, went through into Batu\u0027s room. Sitting on the bed, Batu grinned at him. \u0027Ho, Comrade! And do you have friends here in London? Someone seems to know you.\u0027\n Dragosani scowled at him, snatched up the telephone. \u0027Switchboard? This is Dragosani. What\u0027s all this about?\u0027\n \u0027A call for you from outside, Comrade,\u0027 came the answer in a cold, nasal, female voice.\n \u0027I doubt it. You\u0027ve made a mistake. I\u0027m not known here.\u0027\n \u0027He says you\u0027ll want to speak to him,\u0027 said the operator. \u0027His name is Harry Keogh.\u0027\n \u0027Keogh?\u0027 Dragosani looked at Batu, raised an eye\u0026shy;brow. \u0027Ah, yes! Yes, I do know of him. Put him through.\u0027\n \u0027Very well. Remember, Comrade: speech is insecure.\u0027 There came a click and a buzzing, then:\n \u0027Dragosani, is that you?\u0027 The voice was young but strangely hard. It didn\u0027t quite fit the gaunt, almost vacant face that Dragosani had seen staring at him from the frozen river bank in Scotland.\n \u0027This is Dragosani, yes. What do you want, Harry Keogh?\u0027\n \u0027I want you, necromancer,\u0027 said the cold, hard voice. \u0027I want you, and I\u0027m going to get you.\u0027\n Dragosani\u0027s lips drew back from his needle teeth in a silent snarl. This one was clever, daring, brash -dangerous! \u0027I don\u0027t know who you are,\u0027 he hissed, \u0027but you\u0027re obviously a madman! Explain yourself or get off the phone.\u0027\n \u0027The explanation\u0027s simple, \"Comrade\",\u0027 the voice had\n grown harder still. \u0027I know what you did to Sir Keenan Gormley. He was my friend. An eye for an eye, Dragosani, and a tooth for a tooth. That\u0027s my way, as you\u0027ve already seen. You\u0027re a dead man.\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 Dragosani laughed sardonically. \u0027I\u0027m a dead man, am I? And you, too, have ways with the dead, don\u0027t you, Harry?\u0027\n \u0027What you saw at Shukshin\u0027s was nothing, \"Comrade\",\u0027 said the icy voice. \u0027You don\u0027t know all of it. Not even Gormley knew all of it.\u0027\n \u0027Bluff, Harry!\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027I\u0027ve seen what you can do and it doesn\u0027t frighten me. Death is my friend. He tells me everything.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s good,\u0027 said the voice, \u0027for you\u0027ll be speaking to him again soon - but face to face. So you know what I can do, do you? Well think about this: next time I\u0027ll be doing it to you!\u0027\n \u0027A challenge, Harry?\u0027 Dragosani\u0027s voice was dangerously low, full of menace.\n \u0027A challenge,\u0027 the other agreed, \u0027and the winner takes all.\u0027\n Dragosani\u0027s Wallach blood was up; he was eager now: \u0027But where? I\u0027m already beyond your reach. And tomorrow there\u0027ll be half a world between.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I know you\u0027re running now,\u0027 said the other contemptuously. \u0027But I\u0027ll find you, and soon. You, and Batu, and Borowitz...\u0027\n Again Dragosani\u0027s lips drew back in a hiss. \u0027Perhaps we should meet, Harry - but where, how?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll know when it\u0027s time,\u0027 said the voice. \u0027And know this, too: it will be worse for you than it was for Gormley.\u0027\n Suddenly the ice in Keogh\u0027s voice seemed to fill Dragosani\u0027s veins. He shook himself, pulled himself together, said: \u0027Very well, Harry Keogh. Whenever and wherever, I\u0027ll be waiting for you.\u0027\n \u0027And the winner takes all,\u0027 said the voice a second time. There came a faint click and the dead line began its intermittent, staccato purring.\n For long moments Dragosani stared at the receiver in his hand, then hurled it down into its cradle. \u0027Oh, I surely will!\u0027 he rasped then. \u0027Be sure I\u0027ll take everything, Harry Keogh!\u0027\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-necroscope-1/page-14.html","bookId":2436,"book":{"id":2436,"title":"Necroscope (Necroscope #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry is an English youth in school, and strange things occur as he grows up, such as a sudden increased intellect in mathematics, and the ability to fight beyond his experience after a teacher is killed.
