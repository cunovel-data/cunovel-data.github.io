{"id":78770,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Twenty minutes before sundown Dragosani was back in the secret place. The piglet had regained consciousness but did not yet have the strength to stand up. Wasting no time and wanting no distractions, Dragosani knocked the struggling animal out again with a single blow of a KGB-issue cosh. Then he settled down and waited, smoked a cigarette, watched the light fading as the sun sank lower and lower. Here where the pines grew straight as spears in a ring about the ancient tomb, the only real light came from directly overhead, and that was filtered down through an interlacing mesh of branches; but as night drew on so the first stars began to come out, visible in advance to Dragosani, much as they would be to a man in a deep well. And at last, as he ground out his cigarette and the gloom closed that much more tightly around him: Ahhh! Dragosaaniiii! The unseen presences were there as always, springing up from nowhere, invisible wraiths whose fingers brushed Dragosani\u0027s face as if seeking to know him, to be sure of his identity. He shivered and said: \u0027Yes, it\u0027s me. And I\u0027ve brought something for you. A gift.\u0027 Oh? And what is this gift? And what would you have from me in return? Now Dragosani was eager and made no effort to hide it. \u0027The gift is ... a small tribute. You shall have it later, before I go. As for now: \u0027I\u0027ve talked to you in this place, old dragon, many times - and yet you\u0027ve never really told me anything. Oh, I\u0027m not saying that you\u0027ve deceived or misled me, just that I\u0027ve learned very little from you. Now that may well have been my own fault, I may not have asked the right questions, but in any case it\u0027s something I want to put right. There are things you know which I desire to know. There once was a time when you had... powers! I suspect you\u0027ve retained many of them, which I don\u0027t know about.\u0027 Powers? Oh, yes - many powers. Great powers... \u0027I want the secret of those powers. I want the powers themselves. All that you knew and know now, I want to know.\u0027 In short, you desire to be... Wamphyr! The word and the way it was uttered in his mind were such that Dragosani could not suppress a shudder. Even he, Dragosani himself - necromancer, examiner of the dead - felt its alien awe, as if the word in itself conveyed something of the awful nature of the being or beings it named. \u0027Wamphyr...\u0027 he repeated it, and then: \u0027Here in Romania,\u0027 he quickly went on, \u0027there have always been legends, and in the last hundred years they\u0027ve spread abroad. Personally, I\u0027ve known what you are for many years now, old devil. Here they call you vampir, and in the Western world you are a vampire. There you\u0027re a creature in tales to be told at night by the fireside, stories to frighten the children to bed and stir the morbid imagination. But now I want to know what you really are. I want to separate fact from fiction. I want to take the lies out of the legend.\u0027 He sensed a mental shrug. Then, I say it again, you would be Wamphyr. There is no other way to know it all. \u0027But you have a history,\u0027 Dragosani insisted. \u0027Five hundred years you\u0027ve lain here - yes, I know that - but what of the five hundred before you died?\u0027 Died? But I did not die. They might have murdered me, yes, for it was in their power to do so. But they chose to. The punishment they chose was greater far. They merely buried me here, undead! But that aside... you want to know my history? \u0027Yes!\u0027 It\u0027s a long one, and bloody. It will take time. \u0027We have time, plenty of it,\u0027 said Dragosani - but he sensed a restlessness, frustration in the unseen presences. It was as if something warned him not to try his luck too far. It was not in the undead thing\u0027s nature to be pressured. But finally: / can tell you something of my history, yes. I can tell you what I did, but not how it was done. Not in so many words. Knowing my origins, my roots, will not help you to be of the Wamphyri, nor even to understand them. I can no more explain how to be Wamphyr than a fish could explain how to be a fish - or a bird how to be a bird. If you tried to be a fish you would drown. Launch yourself from the face of a cliff, like a bird, and you would fall and be crushed. And if the ways of simple creatures such as these are unknowable, how then the ways of the Wamphyri? \u0027May I learn nothing of your ways, then?\u0027 Dragosani was growing angry. He shook his head. \u0027Nothing of your powers? I don\u0027t think I believe you. You showed me how to speak to the dead, so why can\u0027t you show me the rest of it?\u0027 Ah! No, you are mistaken, Dragosani. I showed you how to be a necromancer, which is a human talent. It is in the main a forgotten art among men, to be sure, but nevertheless necromancy is an art old as the race itself. As for speaking to the dead: that is something else entirely. Very few men ever mastered that for a skill! \u0027But I talk to you!\u0027 No, my son, I talk to you. Because you are one of mine. And remember, I am not dead. I am undead. Even I could not talk to the dead. Examine them, yes, but never talk to them. The difference lies in one\u0027s approach, in their acceptance of one, and in their willingness to converse. As for necromancy: there the corpse is unwilling, the necromancer extracts the information like a torturer, like a dentist drawing good teeth! Suddenly Dragosani felt that the conversation was going in circles. \u0027Stop!\u0027 he cried. \u0027You are deliberately obscuring the issue!\u0027 / am answering your questions as best I might. \u0027Very well. Then don\u0027t tell me how to be a Wamphyr, but tell me what a Wamphyr is. Tell me your history. Tell me what you did in your life, if not how you did it. Tell me of your origins...\u0027 After a moment: As you will. But first... first you tell me what you know - or think you know - of the Wamphyri. Tell me about these \u0027myths\u0027, these \u0027old wives\u0027 tales\u0027 which you\u0027ve heard, on which you appear to be something of an authority. Then, as you say, we shall separate the lies from the legend. Dragosani sighed, leaned his back against a slab, lit another cigarette. He still felt he was getting the run-around, but there seemed little he could do about it. It was dark now but his eyes were accustomed to the gloom; anyway, he knew every twisted root and broken slab. At his feet the piglet snorted fitfully, then lay still again. \u0027We\u0027ll take it step by step,\u0027 he growled. A mental shrug. \u0027Very well, let\u0027s start with this: A vampire is a thing of darkness, loyal subject of Satan.\u0027 Ha, ha, ha! Shaitan was first of all the Wamphyri - in our legends, you understand. Things of darkness: yes, in that night is our element. We are . .. different. But there is a saying: that at night all cats are grey! Thus, at night, our differences are not so great - or are not seen to be so great. And before you ask it, let me tell you this: that because of our proclivity for darkness, the sun is harmful to us. \u0027Harmful? It would destroy you, turn you to dust!\u0027 What? That is a myth! No, nothing so terrible - but even weak sunlight will sicken us, just as strong sunlight sickens you. \u0027You fear the cross, symbol of Christianity.\u0027 I hate the cross! To me it is the symbol of all lies, all treachery. But fear it? No... \u0027Are you telling me that if a cross were held against you - a holy crucifix - it wouldn\u0027t burn your flesh?\u0027 My flesh might burn with loathing - in the moment before I struck dead the one who held the cross! Dragosani took a deep breath. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t deceive me?\u0027 Your doubts tax my patience, Dragosani. Cursing under his breath for a moment, finally Dragosani continued: \u0027You cast no reflection. Neither in a mirror, nor in water. Similarly, you have no shadow.\u0027 Ah! A simple misconception - but not without its sources. The reflection I cast is not always the same, and my shadow does not always conform to my shape. Dragosani frowned. (He remembered the leprous tentacle from that time almost twenty years ago.) \u0027Do you mean that you are fluid, unsolid? That you can change your shape?\u0027 / did not say that. \u0027Then explain what you did say.\u0027 Now it was the turn of the old one in the ground to sigh. Will you leave nothing of mystery, Dragosani? No, I\u0027m sure you won\u0027t... But now Dragosani was doing some thinking for himself. \u0027I believe this may answer two questions in one,\u0027 he said while the other pondered. \u0027Your ability to change into a bat or a wolf, for example. That\u0027s part of the legend, too. If it is legend. Are you a shape-changer?\u0027 He sensed the other\u0027s amusement. No, but I might seem to be such a creature. In fact there is no such thing as a shape-changer, not that I ever encountered... Then ... it seemed that the old one had come to a decision. Very well, I will tell you: what do you know of the power of hypnotism? \u0027Hypnotism?\u0027 Dragosani repeated, continuing to frown. But then his jaw fell open as he saw the truth, or what might be the truth, in a sudden flash of realisation. \u0027Hypnotism!\u0027 he gasped. \u0027Mass hypnotism! That\u0027s how you did it!\u0027 Of course. But while it fools the mind it cannot fool a mirror. And while I might appear to be a fluttering bat or loping wolf, still my shadow is that of a man. Ah! The mystique falls away, eh, Dragosani? Dragosani remembered the leprous tentacle again but said nothing. He had long ago decided that dead (or undead) things which talked in men\u0027s minds might also be masters of deception. Anyway, he had other questions to ask: \u0027You can\u0027t cross running water. It drowns you.\u0027 Hmmm! I may have an answer to that one, too. In my life I was a mercenary Voevod. And aye, I would not cross running water! It was my strategy. When the invader came I waited and let him cross the water - and slaughtered him on my side. Perhaps this is where this legend arose, on the banks of the Dunarea, the Motrul and the Siretul. And I have seen those rivers run red, Dragosani... While the other offered his explanation, Dragosani had been building up to the big one. Now, without pause, he tossed it in: \u0027You drink the blood of the living! It is a lust in you, which drives you on. Without blood you die. Your utterly evil nature demands that you feed on the lives of others. The blood is the life.\u0027 Ridiculous! As for evil: it is a state of mind. If you accept evil you must accept good. Perhaps I am out of touch with your world, Dragosani, but in mine there was very little of good! And as for drinking blood: do you take meat? And wine? Of course you do! You devour the flesh of beasts and the blood of the grape. And is that evil? Show me a creature which lives, which does not devour lesser lives. This legend springs from my cruelties, which I admit, and from all the blood I spilled in my lifetime. As to why I was so cruel: it seemed to me that if my enemies believed I was a monster, then that they would be reluctant to come against me. And so I was a monster! If my legend has lasted so long and grown so fraught with terror, who may say I was wrong? \u0027That doesn\u0027t answer my question. I - \u0027 And I ... am tired now. Do you know what it takes from me, this sort of inquisition? And do you think I am one of your corpses, Dragosani? A suitable case for necromantic examination? At that a thought came into Dragosani\u0027s mind - but he suppressed it at once. \u0027One last question,\u0027 he said darkly. Very well, if you must. \u0027The legend has it that the vampire\u0027s bite turns ordinary men into vampires. If you were to draw my blood, old one, would I become as you - undead?\u0027 A long pause, through which Dragosani sensed something of confusion, a mental scrabbling for an answer. And finally: There was a time in the world\u0027s youth when the forests were alive with great bats, as they were with all sorts of creatures. Disease destroyed most of them - a specific disease, and horrible - but some learned to live with it. In my day a species existed which drew the blood of other animals, including men. Since the bats were carriers of the disease, they passed it on to those they bit, and the infected victims were seen to take on certain characteristics which - \u0027Stop!\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027You mean the vampire bat, which still exists in Central and South America even today? Obviously you do. The disease is rabies. But... I don\u0027t see the connection.\u0027 The thing in the ground chose to ignore his scepticism, said: America? \u0027A new land,\u0027 Dragosani explained. \u0027They hadn\u0027t found it in your day. It\u0027s vast and rich and... very, very powerful!\u0027 Ah? You say so? Well! And you must describe this entire new world of yours in more detail - but on some other occasion. As for now... I am tired, and - \u0027Not so fast!\u0027 cried Dragosani, aware that the conversation had strayed. \u0027Are you saying I wouldn\u0027t become a vampire if you bit me? Are you trying to say that the legend is unfounded, except upon this supposed connection with vampire bats? That won\u0027t wash, old devil! No, for the bat was named after you, not you after the bat!\u0027 Another pause - but not so long as to give the other too much time to think over what he had said - and Dragosani quickly continued: \u0027You asked me if I desired to be of the Wamphyri. And how would you make me a Wamphyr if not in this way? Could I be \"invested\" with it, then, as you were once invested with the Order of the Dragon? Hah! No more lies, old devil. I want only the truth. And if you really are my \"father\", why do you hold the truth back? What do you fear?\u0027 Dragosani felt the disapproval of the unseen presences, sensed them drawing back from him. In his mind the other\u0027s voice was indeed tired now - and accusing. You promised me a gift, a small tribute, and brought me only weariness and torment. I am a spark that grows dim, my son, an ember that expires. You have kept the flickering flame alive, and would you now snuff it out? Let me sleep now, if you would not... exhaust... me... utterly... Dragosaaniiii... Dragosani clenched his teeth, growled his frustration low in his throat, snatched up the piglet by its hind legs. He jumped to his feet, took out a switchblade and snapped it open. The blade glittered sharp as a razor. \u0027Your gift!\u0027 he snapped. The piglet struggled, squealed once. Dragosani slit its throat, let the scarlet blood spray out, then drain on to the dark earth. A wind at once sprang up that sighed in the pines with a voice not unlike that of the thing in the ground: Ahhh! Dragosani tossed the piglet\u0027s corpse down in tangled rootlets, stepped back from it, took out a handkerchief and cleaned his hands. The unseen presences crept forward. \u0027Back!\u0027 Dragosani snapped, turning on his heel to leave. \u0027Back, you ghosts of men. It\u0027s for him, not you.\u0027 Descending through the pines in total darkness, Dragosani was sure-footed as a cat. In his way, he too was a creature of the night. But a live one. And thinking of life, death, undeath, he smiled an emotionless smile into the darkness as he considered again the one question he had not asked: How might one kill a vampire? Kill it dead. No, he had not asked the thing in the ground that question - not in a place such as this, during the hours of darkness. For who could gauge what the reaction might or might not be? It could be a very dangerous question indeed. And anyway, Dragosani believed he already knew the answer. The next day was Thursday. Dragosani had spent a poor night with very little sleep, and he was up early. Looking out of his window, he saw Use Kinkovsi feeding chickens where they had wandered out of the farmyard and on to the grass verge of the country road. Out of the corner of her eye she saw his movement at the window and turned her face up to him. Dragosani had thrown the windows wide, was breathing the morning air deeply into his lungs. Leaning on the sill, leaning out into the light, his flesh was pale as snow. Use looked at his naked chest. When he breathed in deeply like that, the muscles under his arms where they fed down into his back seemed to swell out like air sacs. He was deceptive, this one. She suspected he would be very powerful. \u0027Good morning!\u0027 she called up. For an answer he nodded, and staring at her knew now why he\u0027d slept so badly. She was the reason... \u0027Is that good?\u0027 she asked, her teeth white where she deliberately licked them. \u0027What?\u0027 he went on the defensive again - and at once silently cursed himself for an immature child. Yes, him Dragosani! \u0027The air on your skin like that. Does it feel good? But look at you, so pale! You could use some sunlight, too, Herr Dragosani.\u0027 \u0027Yes, you could... could be right,\u0027 he stuttered, and withdrew from the window to get dressed. Angrily tugging his clothes on, he thought: women, females, sex! So... ugly? Is it? So unnatural! And so... necessary? Is this what I lack? Well, there was a way to find out. Tonight. It would have to be tonight, for tomorrow the English were coming. He made up his mind and went back to the window. Use had gone back to feeding her chickens. Hearing his cough, she looked up to see him buttoning his shirt, staring down at her. For a long moment their eyes met; then, stumblingly, he said: \u0027Use, does it get chilly still? Er, in the night, I mean...\u0027 She frowned, wondering what he was getting at. \u0027Cold? Why, no, it\u0027s summer.\u0027 \u0027Then tonight,\u0027 he blurted, \u0027I believe I\u0027ll leave my window - and my curtains - open.\u0027 Her frown lifted. She tossed her head and laughed. \u0027That\u0027s very healthy,\u0027 she answered after a moment. \u0027I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll feel better for it.\u0027 Embarrassed now, Dragosani once more withdrew, closed the window and finished dressing. For a moment or two he regretted what he had done - this rendezvous so simply arranged, which in fact seemed to have been arranged for him - but finally he shrugged the feeling off. It was done now. What would be would be. And anyway, it was time he lost his virginity. Lost his virginity, indeed! It made him sound like a young girl! And yet there was a touching naivety about that phrase, unlike the blunt delivery of his undead mentor. How had the old devil in the ground put it that time? \u0027A mere pup who never breached a bitch Yes, that was it - and he\u0027d been referring to Dragosani\u0027s father. His true father. And so I got into his mind... and I bequeathed the night to them! He got into his mind - to show him how to do it ... Dragosani started as a pebble clattered against his window. He had been sitting on his bed, lost in thought. Now he got up, opened the window again. It was Use. \u0027Breakfast in your room, Herr Dragosani?\u0027 she called up, \u0027or will you eat with us?\u0027 The emphasis she put on \u0027in your room\u0027 was unmistakable, but Dragosani ignored it. No, for first he must speak to the old dragon. \u0027I\u0027ll come down,\u0027 he answered, and narrowed his eyes thoughtfully at the disappointment which instantly registered in her face. Oh, yes, he would need assistance with this one, this time, this first time. She would know exactly what she was about, and he knew nothing. But ... the Wamphyr knew everything. And Dragosani suspected that there were certain secrets which even that devious old one wouldn\u0027t mind divulging. No, not at all... Dragosani\u0027s sexual problem - rather, the mental block which had until now checked his psychological development in this area - had been implanted in puberty, at a time when other boys went on to steal their first kisses and explore their first soft bodies with hot, groping, inexperienced fingers. It had happened during his third year in Bucharest while he was boarding at the college there. He had been thirteen and looking forward to the summer break. Then his step-father\u0027s letter had arrived telling him not to come home. There was disease on the farm; the animals were being slaughtered; visitors were forbidden and even Boris would not be allowed on to the estate. The fever was virulent; people could easily spread it about on their feet, their shoes; the entire area for twenty miles around was under quarantine. A disaster, apparently - but it need not prove to be one for Boris. He had an \u0027aunt\u0027 in Bucharest, his stepfather\u0027s younger sister, and could stay at her house for the break. It was better than nothing; at least he would have somewhere to go and not be stuck in an outbuilding of the old college, cooking his own food on a tiny stove. His Aunt Hildegard was a young widow with two daughters only a year or so older than Boris himself, Anna and Katrina, and they lived in a large, rambling wooden house on the Budesti road. Oddly, they had never been much mentioned at home and Boris had only ever met them on their very infrequent visits to the Romanian countryside. He had always found his aunt very affectionate, perhaps too much so - and his cousins a little sickly and giggly in the way of young girls, except that there were also undercurrents of a sly sensuality beyond their years - but hardly darkly suspicious or especially odd. Yet he gained the impression from his step-father\u0027s attitude towards them that his aunt was something of a black sheep, or at least a lady with a terrible secret. In the three weeks he lived with her and her precocious daughters, when the college closed down for the summer break, Boris had discovered all he believed he needed to know of her \u0027oddness\u0027, of sex and the perverse ways of females, and his experiences had turned him off for all the years in between - until now. For the simple fact of the matter had been that his aunt was a nymphomaniac. Recently set free by the death of her husband, she had allowed her sexual obsession to get out of hand; and her daughters, apparently, were cut of pretty much the same cloth. Even when her ailing husband had been alive she had been notorious for her lovers. Word of her affairs had often got back to her brother in the country, so bringing about his aloofness, his disapproval. He was no prude himself, but he considered her little more than a whore. Just how far she had carried her excesses was beyond her brother\u0027s power to know, especially now that he had broken off almost all contact with her. If he had known, then he would have made other arrangements for the youth; but his adopted son was, after all, barely a boy; he would surely stand exempt from the woman\u0027s vices. Boris had known none of this but was to find out about it soon enough. To begin with, there had been no locks on any of the interior doors in his aunt\u0027s house. Neither the bedrooms nor the bathroom had locks, not even the toilets. Aunt Hildegard had explained that there were no secret places here - nowhere for the performance of secret deeds -and that secret things in general were not tolerated. Which made it hard for Boris to understand the secretive or mischievously furtive looks which often passed between mother and daughters when he was present. As for privacy: there was likewise absolutely no need for privacy in a place where nothing was forbidden, nothing frowned upon. Enquiring as to his aunt\u0027s philosophy, Boris had been told that this was \u0027a house of Nature\u0027, where the human body and its functions were things of Nature given us to \u0027explore, discover, understand and enjoy to their full, without conventional restrictions\u0027. Provided that he respect the house and property of his hostess, there was nothing he could not do here and welcome; but he must similarly respect the \u0027natural\u0027 behaviour of the resident females of the house, whose ways he would find entirely open and unrestricted. As for philosophy as such: there was too little love in the world and too much hatred; if the lusts of the body and fires of the spirit could be quenched, sated in the pleasurable violence of embraces instead of war, then surely it would be a better place. Perhaps Boris would not understand immediately, but his aunt was sure that he would in a little while... After an early supper on the first evening, Boris had gone up to his room to read. He had brought some of his own books with him from the college, but at the foot of the stairs leading to his bedroom was a tiny room set aside by his aunt as her \u0027library\u0027. Looking in, Boris had found the shelves full of erotica and sexual perversions and abnormalities, some of which were so fascinating that he took several of the illustrated volumes upstairs with him. They were unlike anything he had ever seen before, even in the College library which was fairly comprehensive. In his bedroom he had become engrossed with one of the books (which purported to be factual but was so \u0027Improbable\u0027 to Boris\u0027s mind that he \u0027knew\u0027 it must be a spoof, a work of highly imaginative fiction; though how some of the alleged photographs had been produced was quite beyond him) and, like any boy of his age, soon found himself aroused. Masturbation was not unknown to Boris - he relieved himself that way from time to time as most young men do - but here in his aunt\u0027s house he hadn\u0027t felt secure or private enough to do so. To avoid further frustration, he had taken the books back downstairs to the library. Earlier, while reading, he had heard a car pull up to the house and the arrival and entry of some visitor or other, someone obviously popular with the household, but had paid no heed. As he deposited the books back in the library, however, he now heard laughter and the sounds of physical activity and apparent enjoyment from the main living-room - a room he had been shown and in which he\u0027d admired the mirrors set all about and the curiously mirrored ceiling - and was drawn to see what was taking place. The door stood a little ajar, and from within as he approached in silence Boris could hear a guttural male voice, straining in something of exertion, plus the now coarsened and urgent voices of his step-aunt and -cousins. It was then that he had started to suspect that something very much out of the ordinary must be going on in there. Boris paused at the door to stare in through the inches-wide gap and was shocked almost rigid by what he saw. Far from being \u0027fantastic\u0027 as he had supposed, the book he had been reading had contained nothing comparable with this! The man - a stranger to Boris, bearded, pockmarked, huge in the belly and hairy - was quite repulsive in his looks and almost malformed in his body. Also, he was naked. What Boris could not know was that he was a satyr, which by this house\u0027s standards more than compensated for his ugliness and malformation. Viewing the interior of the room through a mirror which stood just inside the door, therefore not directly, Boris could not see the entire performance, but what he could see was more than enough. The three females were taking turns with their playmate, urging him to greater efforts, working on him with their hands and mouths and bodies in a frenzy of sexual excess. He lay on his back upon a divan, while the younger of the sisters, Anna, kneeled astride him and literally bounced herself up and down on him. With each upward bound of her body she revealed most of the great length and thickness of him, shiny with the liquids of their throbbing bodies. With each brief appearance of that slippery pole of flesh, Boris could see Katrina\u0027s tiny and almost fragile hand locked tightly around its girth between the two where they continued to collide, working at it no less than her sister\u0027s jolting body. As for the mother of the girls, \u0027Aunt\u0027 Hildegard, a woman of perhaps thirty-four: she kneeled at the head of the couch and flopped her great loose breasts upon his feverish face, so that her nipples dangled alternately into his gaping, gasping mouth. Occasionally, apparently lost in her ecstasy, she would stretch up, thrusting her pubic region against his quivering lips and tongue. The women were not naked but all the more lewd for their garments, loose, baggy white things which were open and allowed their breasts and buttocks to be fondled, and all parts of them to be touched at will. What transfixed Boris most, riveting him to the spot, was not so much that this was sex - of which he knew very little in any case - but that all four participants seemed so utterly involved and engrossed, each enjoying not only the rewards of his/her own facet of the performance, whatever the part being played, but also the cavorting of the others! But as they changed places and positions before his eyes, and almost without pause commenced a new series of intricate exertions (this time with the man mounted atop his aunt like some awful dog, while the girls played lesser roles), so Boris had begun to understand. No one was neglected here; each became the aggressor in turn, so that all received maximum satisfaction. Or, in Boris\u0027s fevered eyes, so that all seemed equally disgusting. In any event, while he believed that he now understood something of what he was seeing, still he did not quite believe that he was actually seeing it. It was the central character - the man, the awful spurting machine - which he couldn\u0027t fathom. Boris knew how exhausted he always felt after masturbating, so how must this hairy animal in the room of mirrors feel? He seemed to be hosing out semen almost continually, and groaning with the intensity of the pleasure given him by each fresh burst; except that it hardly seemed to weary him at all but only served to drive him to greater excess. Surely he must collapse at any moment now! And as Boris had finally got his legs going and backed away from the door - and as if his aunt had been thinking almost precisely the same thing as Boris himself - he heard her gaspingly say: \u0027Now, now, you two! Let\u0027s not weary Dmitri so quickly. Why don\u0027t you go and play with Boris, eh? But not too fiercely or else you might frighten him. Poor lamb, he looks the sort who\u0027d frighten very easily. About as lusty as a lettuce!\u0027 That had been enough to send Boris scrambling frantically upstairs to his room, out of his clothes in a flash and into bed. There he lay and cringed - knowing his door was unlocked, that it couldn\u0027t be locked - waiting for ... something he daren\u0027t even essay a guess at. If he had been alone with one cousin, one normal girl, then perhaps things might have been different. Perhaps then there might have been a shy, gradual, fumbling introduction to sex - to normal sex - with Boris himself taking the stumbling initiative. For until now Boris\u0027s dreams and fancies in this respect had been fairly ordinary. He had even entertained fantasies of being alone with his aunt - of smothering himself in her soft breasts, her white body - and had not found them especially abhorrent or shameful. Not before. But now he had seen! Any innocence his fantasies might have contained was gone now, wrenched out of him. What could there possibly be of normal, healthy sex now? Was there any such thing? He had seen, yes. Downstairs in this very house he had seen three women (he could no longer think of his cousins as girls) coupling with a seemingly inexhaustible beast. He had seen the beast\u0027s great pole of lusting flesh. And should he compare himself with that? Did he as a male even exist after that? A twig against a branch? And must he be a party to orgies, such as that - like one small hare amongst a pack of hounds? The mere thought of contact with the beast was sickening! These had been his thoughts as his cousins came looking for him where he lay wrapped in sheets and blankets, absolutely still and breathless in his bed. He had heard them enter, had tried not to twitch when Anna had giggled throatily and asked: \u0027 Boris, are you awake?\u0027 \u0027Is he? Is he?\u0027 Katrina had eagerly wanted to know. \u0027No, I don\u0027t think so.\u0027 (Disappointed.) \u0027But... his light is on!\u0027 \u0027Boris?\u0027 (Anna\u0027s weight pressing down on his bed beside him.)\u0027Are you sure you\u0027re asleep?\u0027 Feigning sleep, his heart hammering, Boris had turned a little where he lay, grumbled, said: \u0027Wha-? What? Go away. I\u0027m tired.\u0027 It was a mistake. Both of them giggled now, their voices still coarse and full of lust. \u0027Boris, won\u0027t you play a game with us?\u0027 said Katrina. \u0027Stick your head out, at least. We\u0027ve something...\u0027 (more giggles) \u0027... something to show you!\u0027 He couldn\u0027t breathe. He\u0027d tugged his bedclothes so close and tight that he\u0027d shut out the air. He would have to come out in a moment, whether he wanted to or not. \u0027Please go away and let me sleep.\u0027 \u0027Boris\u0027 (Anna again, and a vision of her with her dainty hands on the beast\u0027s belly, jolting up and down on that pink pole) \u0027if we put the lights out will you come out?\u0027 For a moment - the merest moment - a gulp of air - just long enough to fill his lungs! \u0027Yes,\u0027 he had gasped. Then he\u0027d heard the click of the light switch and felt Anna stand up, lifting her weight from his bed. \u0027There, it\u0027s out!\u0027 It was out, as Boris discovered a moment later when, having struggled to free his head, he thrust it into darkness and breathed air deeply into his starved lungs - and almost gagged! And at once, with more giggles from across the room, the light came on again. Which of the girls it was, he couldn\u0027t tell, but one of them had been standing beside his bed with her loose cassock thing over his head like a tent. The musty smell of her body had been beating into his face, and he had seen the dark V of her pubic patch dewed with a string of milky semen pearls. The light through her garment wasn\u0027t good, but it was good enough for Boris to see, when she deliberately bowed her legs outward a little, what looked to him like the parting of that patch into a greedy vertical grin! \u0027There!\u0027 Boris had dimly remembered a husky voice saying, through a rising gale of coarse laughter. \u0027And didn\u0027t we tell you we had something to show you?\u0027 But that was all that was said, for suddenly beside himself in a panic of loathing, that was when Boris had lashed out. Later he remembered little of it - only the giggles turning to screams, and the dull pain in his fists and skinned knuckles - but he did remember how, the next day, his tormentors had kept well away from him; and how both of them had sported blue bruises, while Anna had a split lip and Katrina a great black eye! Perhaps his aunt had been correct to liken him to a lettuce - in one direction. But as for tenacity and ferocity - Boris had lacked neither one. That next day had been nightmarish. Exhausted after a night of wakefulness, barricaded in his room against all entreaty to come out, Boris had had to suffer his aunt\u0027s wrath and (from a safe distance) the accusations of her oversexed daughters. Aunt Hildegard would not feed him, starving him for punishment, and she swore that she would complain to his father if he didn\u0027t come to his senses at once. By that she meant that he should come out of his room and talk to her, apologise to the girls, and generally pretend that nothing had happened. He would have none of it, remaining in his room except for short and hurried excursions to the toilet and bathroom, determined that before nightfall he would flee the house and make his way back to Bucharest. The only trouble with that scheme was that his father was bound to find out and would want to know why, and Boris would simply not be able to tell him. He\u0027d never been an easy man to talk to, and this - this had been simply unbelievable. And even then, assuming his step-father did believe and accepted all that had happened, mightn\u0027t there still be doubts about Boris\u0027s own - participation? His active, perhaps his willing participation... There were other difficulties, too. Boris had no money and no arrangements had been made for him at the college. Which was why, when evening came around again and when his aunt\u0027s threats turned to pleading, he had dragged his bed and dresser away from the door and allowed her to take him downstairs. She was sorry, she said, that the girls had teased him so badly the night before, and that he\u0027d been so alarmed. What they could possibly have done to offend him so -that he should have reacted so violently - was quite beyond her powers of understanding. But whatever, it was all over now and Boris should try to forget it. It could only cause trouble between herself and her brother if he learned of it - whatever it had been. Oh, yes, for he always blamed her for everything. Boris had silently agreed with her. It would cause trouble, yes - and even more so if there should be mention of the beast! But his aunt didn\u0027t know he knew about that, and it was best that she shouldn\u0027t. Otherwise ... the entire charade would fall apart. Anyway, the satyr was no longer in the house and Boris had hoped he wouldn\u0027t be back; Aunt Hildegard had fed Boris, and later he\u0027d heard her telling Anna and Katrina to leave him completely alone, that he wasn\u0027t for them, and this must all be handled very delicately; the thing had seemed to be finished with, for which Boris had been grateful. Until that night... Exhausted, Boris had slept in his bed against the door, his own weight replacing that of the dresser; but that had not been enough. At about 3:00 a.m., aware of some sort of erratic, intermittent motion, he had come half-awake to hear his aunt\u0027s voice clumsily hushing and lulling him back to sleep, or at least attempting to. Her voice had been slurred and her breathing very heavy; she had been drinking and was naked, as he discovered when he put out his hand in the darkness. That had instantly shocked him fully awake, aware that this insatiable woman was trying to get into bed with him. And at that, immediately and like a cool, salving hand on his hot brow, an icy anger had come over him to oust and completely replace all fear. \u0027Aunt Hildegard,\u0027 he had said into the darkness, sitting up and averting his face from the alcohol on her breath, \u0027please put the light on.\u0027 \u0027Ah! Dear boy! You\u0027re awake and want to see me. But... why! I\u0027ve been to bed, Boris, and I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve no clothes on. So hot, these summer nights! I got up for a little drink of water, and must have stumbled in here by mistake.\u0027 As she finished speaking, her breasts had brushed his face. Gritting his teeth and again turning his face away, Boris had repeated, \u0027Put on the light.\u0027 \u0027But that\u0027s very naughty of you, Boris!\u0027 she\u0027d girlishly pretended to protest, at the same time finding the light switch. And momentarily dazzled, there she had stood quite naked where she\u0027d forced the bed back from the open door. And smiling a little drunkenly at him, which had the effect of making her look utterly stupid and disgusting, she\u0027d moved towards him and reached out her arms. Then, seeing that he was fully dressed, and for the first time noting the strange look on his face, her hand had flown to her mouth. \u0027Boris, I - \u0027 \u0027Aunt,\u0027 he had swung his legs out of bed and slipped his feet into his shoes, \u0027you will get out of this room now, please, and stay out. If you do not, I shall leave, and if the door downstairs is locked then I\u0027ll break a window. Then, as soon as I\u0027m able, I shall tell my step-father exactly what goes on in this house, and -\u0027 \u0027Goes on?\u0027 she was sobering rapidly, trying to catch hold of his hand, beginning to look worried. \u0027About the men who come here, to fuck you and my cousins - like the great bulls which service my stepfather\u0027s cows!\u0027 \u0027Why, you - !\u0027 She had staggered back from him, her eyes wild in a suddenly white face. \u0027You saw? \u0027Get out!\u0027 Boris had sneered at her then, a withering look which he would employ from that day forward when dealing with women, and tried to thrust her from the door. At that her eyes had narrowed to slits and she\u0027d spat at him: \u0027So that\u0027s the way it is, is it? The big boys at the college got to you first, did they? You like them better than girls, do you?\u0027 Boris had turned towards the window then, picking up a chair. \u0027Go on,\u0027 he\u0027d snapped, \u0027out! Or I leave at once, right now. And not only will I tell my father, but also every policeman I meet between here and Bucharest. I\u0027ll tell them about the library of dirty books you keep -which alone might get you a term in prison - and about your daughters, who are little more than girls and already worse than whores - \u0027 \u0027Whores?\u0027 she had cut him off with such a hiss that he\u0027d thought she would fly at him. \u0027 - but who could never be as totally rotten as you!\u0027 he\u0027d finished. Then she had broken down, bursting into tears and letting him shove her from the room without further protest. And for the rest of the night he\u0027d slept soundly and completely undisturbed. That had been the end of it. At midday the next day, while Boris was enjoying his lunch in silence and on his own, his step-father had arrived to take him home. The trouble with the animals was over; it had not been so serious after all, thank God! Never had Boris been so glad to see anyone in his whole life, and he\u0027d had to fight hard not to show it too much. While he got his things together Aunt Hildegard spent an apparently cordial if careful half-hour with her brother, who made a point of asking after his nieces, neither of them being present. Then, with brief farewells, Boris and his step-father had left to begin their trip back into the country. At the gate as they got into the car, Aunt Hildegard had managed to catch Boris\u0027s eye. Her look, just for a second, before she began to wave them goodbye, was pleading. Her eyes begged his silence. In answer he had once more shown her that sneer, that look far worse than any snarl or threat, which said more of what he thought of her than any thousand words ever could. In any event, he had never spoken of that awful visit to anyone. Nor would he ever, not even to the thing in the ground. The thing in the ground... the old devil... the Wamphyr. He was waiting (what else could he do but wait?) when Dragosani arrived in the gloomy glade of the tomb just before dusk with another piglet in a sack. He was awake, angry, lying there in the ground and fuming. And as the sun\u0027s rim touched the rim of the world and the far horizon turned to blood, he was the first to speak: Dragosani? I smell you, Dragosani! And have you come to torment me? With more questions, more demands? Would you steal my secrets, Dragosani? Little by little, piece by piece, until there\u0027s nothing left of me? And then what? When I lie here in the cold earth, how will you reward me? With the blood of a pig? Ahaaa!I see it\u0027s so. Another piglet - for one who has bathed in the blood of men and virgins and armies! Often! \u0027Blood is blood, old dragon,\u0027 Dragosani answered. \u0027And I note you\u0027re more agile tonight for what you drank last night!\u0027 For what I drank? (Scorn, but feigned or genuine?) No, the earth is the richer, Dragosani, not these old bones. \u0027I don\u0027t believe you.\u0027 And I don\u0027t care! Go, leave me be, you dishonour me. I have nothing for you and will have nothing from you. I do not wish to talk. Begone! Dragosani grinned. \u0027I\u0027ve brought another pig, yes - for you or for the earth, whichever - but there\u0027s something more, something rare. Except...\u0027 The old one was interested, intrigued. Except? Dragosani shrugged. \u0027Perhaps it has been too long. Perhaps you\u0027re not up to it. Perhaps it\u0027s impossible -even for you. For after all, what are you but a dead thing?\u0027 And before the other could object: \u0027Or an undead thing, if you insist.\u0027 I do insist... Are you taunting me, Dragosani? What is it you bring me this night? What would you give me? What do you... propose? \u0027Maybe it\u0027s more what we can give each other.\u0027 Say on. Dragosani told him what was in his mind, exactly what it was he was willing to share. And you would trade? What would you have from me in return for this... sharing? (Dragosani could almost sense the Wamphyr licking its lips.) \u0027Knowledge,\u0027 Dragosani answered at once. \u0027I\u0027m just a man, with a man\u0027s knowledge of women,\u0027 he lied, \u0027and - \u0027 He paused in confusion, for the old one was chuckling! It had been a mistake to lie to him. Oh? A man\u0027s knowledge of women? A \u0027complete\u0027 man\u0027s knowledge, eh, Dragosani? He gritted his teeth, choked out: \u0027There hasn\u0027t been time ... my work, studies ... the opportunity hasn\u0027t arisen.\u0027 Time? Studies? Opportunity? Dragosani, you are not a child. I was eleven when I tore through my first maidenhead, a thousand years ago. After that - virgin, bitch, whore, what did it matter? I had them all, in all ways -and always wanted more! And you? You have not tasted? You have not soaked yourself in the sweat and the juice and the hot sweet blood of a woman? Not one? And you call me a dead thing! The old one laughed then, laughed uproariously, outrageously, obscenely. He found it all so ecstatically ridiculous! His laughter went on and on, became a deluge, a tidal wave, a howling ocean of laughter in Dragosani\u0027s head, threatening to drown him. \u0027Damn you!\u0027 he stood up and stamped on the earth, spat on it. \u0027Damn you!\u0027 he shook his knotted fists at the black soil and tumbled slabs. \u0027Damn you, damn you, damn you!\u0027 The old one was quiet in a moment, oozing like some nightmare slug in Dragosani\u0027s mind. But I\u0027m already damned, my son, he said, after a little while. Yes, and so are you... Dragosani snatched out his knife, reached for the shunned piglet. Wait! Not so hasty, Dragosani. I have not refused. But tell me: since it would appear that like some puny priest you\u0027ve abstained for all these long years, why now? Dragosani thought about it, decided he might as well tell the truth. The old devil in the ground had probably seen through him, anyway. \u0027It\u0027s the woman. She aggravates me, taunts me, flaunts her flesh.\u0027 Ahhh! I know the sort. \u0027Also, I believe she thinks I\u0027ve been with men - or at least she has wondered about it.\u0027 Like the Turks? The old one\u0027s mental response was sharp, touched with hatred. That is an insult! \u0027I think so too,\u0027 Dragosani nodded. \u0027So... will you do it?\u0027 You are inviting me into your mind, am I correct? Tonight, when this woman comes to you? \u0027Yes.\u0027 And it is an invitation, made of your own free will? Dragosani grew wary. \u0027Just this once,\u0027 he answered. \u0027It will have no permanence.\u0027 Again you flatter yourself, the other chuckled. I have -or will have - my own body, Dragosani, which is nothing so weak as yours! \u0027And you can do it? And will I learn from it?\u0027 Oh, I can do it, my son, yeeessss! Have you forgotten the fledgling? And didn\u0027t you learn something that time, too? Who made you a necromancer, Dragosani? Yes, and this time you will learn... much! \u0027Then I want nothing more from you - for now, anyway.\u0027 He began to back away from the tomb, moving downhill, away from that place of centuried horror. And - But what of the piglet? asked the thickly glutinous voice in his head. And more hurriedly: For the earth, Dragosani, for the earth. In the deep, unquiet gloom, Dragosani narrowed his eyes. \u0027Oh, yes, I very nearly forgot,\u0027 he said, his tone not quite sarcastic. \u0027The piglet, of course. For the earth Quickly he returned, slit the insensate animal\u0027s throat, tossed its pink body down. And then, without looking back, he made silently away. A little way down the slope, against the bole of a tree where great roots forked, trapped there and unable to roll any farther, he saw something strange and stopped to pick it up. It was last night\u0027s offering, or what remained of it. A tightly interwoven ball of pink skin and crushed bones, all dry as crumpled cardboard. A beetle crawled on it, seeking in vain for some morsel of sustenance. Dragosani let it fall and roll out of sight. Oh, yes, he thought - but guarded his thoughts carefully there in the darkness beneath the pines - oh, yes. For the earth. Only for the earth... Dragosani got back to the Kinkovsi place in time to eat supper with the family again; for the last time, though he couldn\u0027t know that then. During the meal Use showed little or no interest in him, which was as well for he felt tense and on edge. He was not sure he\u0027d done the right thing; the old devil in the ground was no fool and had stressed that this would be at Dragosani\u0027s own invitation; his old revulsion was gradually mounting in him as the time approached; but at the same time his body ached for release from years of sexual self-denial. For the first time since his arrival here the food seemed tasteless to him, and even the beer was flat and lifeless. Later, in his room, he paced and fantasised, growing ever more angry with himself and fretful as the hours slipped by. For the third or fourth time since supper he took out the half-dozen volumes he\u0027d brought with him on vampirism, read through the relevant passages, put the books away again, out of sight in a suitcase. According to legend, one must never accept any invitation from a vampire; and, equally important, one must never invite a vampire to do anything! In this the conscious will of the victim (by accepting or making an invitation) was all-important. It meant in effect that it was his decision to be a victim. The will was like a barrier in the mind of the victim which the vampire was reluctant, even unable, to surmount without the aid of the victim himself. Or perhaps, psychologically, it was a barrier the victim must surmount: before he could become a victim, he must first believe ... In Dragosani\u0027s case it was a question of the depth of his belief. He knew the thing in the ground was there, so that didn\u0027t come into it. But as yet he did not know what power - or the extent of the power - the creature could exert externally. Perhaps even more important, now that he had \u0027invited it in\u0027, as it were, he didn\u0027t know the limits of his own resistance, or if he would be able to resist at all. Or if he would want to ... Well, doubtless he would find out soon enough. The hour between midnight and 1:00 a.m. passed incredibly slowly, and as the trysting time approached Dragosani began to hope that Use would think better of it and stay away. She might be sound asleep even now, with no intention of meeting him here. It could simply be a game she played with all of her father\u0027s guests - to make them look and feel foolish! In fact, she might well feel the same way about men as Dragosani - until now -had been caused to feel about women. A half-dozen and more times that thought had come to him, that she was making an utter fool of him, and each time he had gone to the open window to close it and draw his moon-silvered curtains. But on every occasion he had paused, something had stopped him, and he\u0027d snarled silently at his own incompetence in this thing and gone back to sit on his bed in the darkness of the room. Now, at two minutes past the hour, cursing himself for a buffoon and rushing to the window yet again, he was on the point of slamming it shut when - down there in the moonlit farmyard, making its way like a shadow amongst shadows, a figure, dark and gauzy, fleeting - and Use Kinkovsi\u0027s bedroom window open a little way, seeming to smile up at him with her face, her knowing eyes. She was coming! God, how Dragosani needed the old one now! And how he did not want him. Did he need him, really? But... dare he make do without him? Elation vied with terror in Dragosani and was very nearly overwhelmed at the first pass. Terror born not alone of the tryst itself, nor even the purpose of the tryst, but perhaps more out of his own ability - or inability? -to carry it through. He was a man now, yes, but in matters such as this still a boy. The only flesh he had known, whose secrets he had delved, had been cold and dead and unwilling. But this was live and hot and all too willing! Revulsion climbed higher in him, coursed through him like a flood. He had been a boy, just a boy... pictures filled his head in bestial procession, which he had thought were forgotten, thrust out... the visit to his aunt\u0027s house ... his cousins...the beast-thing which he knew had been only a rutting man! God, that - had - been - a -nightmare! And was it to be like that all over again? And himself the lusting, slavering beast? Impossible! He couldn\u0027t! He heard the creak of a stair down in the bowels of the guesthouse, flew to the window and stared wild-eyed out into the night. Another creak, closer, sent him flying to the light switch. She was out there, on the landing, coming to his door! A gust of wind moaned into the room, billowing the curtains, striking at - into - Dragosani\u0027s heart. In a moment all fear, all uncertainty was gone. He stepped out of the moonlight into shadow and waited. The door opened silently and she came in. Trapped in a shaft of moonlight the grey veil-like garment she wore was almost transparent. She closed the door behind her, moved towards the bed. \u0027Herr Dragosani?\u0027 she said, her voice trembling just a little. \u0027I\u0027m here,\u0027 he answered from the shadows. She heard but didn\u0027t look his way. \u0027So ... I was wrong about you,\u0027 she said, raising her arms and drawing off the gauzy shift. Her breasts and buttocks were marble where the moon caressed them. \u0027Yeesss,\u0027 he whispered, stepping forward. \u0027Well,\u0027 now she turned to him, \u0027here I am!\u0027 She stood like a statue carved of milk, gazing at him with nothing at all of innocence. He came forward, a dark silhouette, reaching for her. In daylight she had thought his eyes a trifle weak, a watery blue - a soft, almost feminine, filmstar blue - but now... The night suited him. In the night his eyes were feral -like those of a great wolf. And as he bore her down on to the bed, only then did she feel the first niggling doubt in the back of her mind. His strength was - enormous! \u0027I was very, very wrong about you,\u0027 she said. \u0027Aahhh!\u0027 said Dragosani. The following morning, Dragosani called for his breakfast early. He took it in his room, where Hzak Kinkovsi found him looking (and feeling) more fully alive than he had thought possible. The country air must really agree with him. Use, on the other hand, was not so fortunate. Dragosani didn\u0027t need to enquire after her: her father was full of it, grumbling to himself as he served up a substantial breakfast on a tray. That woman,\u0027 he said, \u0027my Use, is a good strong girl - or should be. But ever since her operation - \u0027 and he had shrugged. \u0027Her operation?\u0027 Dragosani had tried not to seem too interested. \u0027Yes, six years ago. Cancer. Very bad for a young girl. Her womb. So, they took it away. That\u0027s good, she lives. But this is farming country. A man wants a wife who\u0027ll give him children, you know? So, she\u0027ll be an old maid -maybe. Or perhaps she\u0027ll go and get a job in the city. Strong sons are not so important there.\u0027 It explained something, possibly. \u0027I see,\u0027 Dragosani nodded; and, carefully: \u0027But this morning...?\u0027 \u0027Sometimes she doesn\u0027t feel too good, even now. Not often. But today she really isn\u0027t up to much. So, she stays in her room for a day or two. Curtains drawn, dark room, all wrapped up in her bed, shivering. Just like when she was a little girl and sick. She says she doesn\u0027t want a doctor, but - \u0027 he shrugged again. \u0027 - I worry about her.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027I mean, don\u0027t worry about her.\u0027 \u0027Eh?\u0027 Kinkovsi looked surprised. \u0027She\u0027s a full-grown woman. She\u0027ll know what\u0027s best for her. Rest, quiet, a nice dark room. Those are the right things. They\u0027re all I need when I\u0027m a bit down.\u0027 \u0027Hmm! Well, perhaps. But still it\u0027s worrying. And a lot of work to be done, too! The English come today.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 Dragosani was glad that the other had changed the subject. \u0027Maybe I\u0027ll meet them tonight.\u0027 Kinkovsi nodded, looked gloomy. He gathered up the empty tray. \u0027Difficult. I don\u0027t know a lot of English. What I know I learned from tourists.\u0027 \u0027I know some English,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027I can get by.\u0027 \u0027Ah? Well, at least they\u0027ll be able to talk to someone. Anyway, they bring good money - and money talks, eh?\u0027 he managed a\" chuckle. \u0027Enjoy your breakfast, Herr Dragosani.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure I will.\u0027 Beginning to grumble again under his breath, Kinkovsi left the garret room and made his way downstairs. Later, when Dragosani went out, both Hzak and Maura were readying the lower rooms for their expected English guests. By midday Dragosani had driven into Pitesti. He did not know why exactly, except that he remembered the town had a small but very comprehensive reference library. Whether or not he would have gone to the library - or what he would have done there - is academic. The question did not arise for he was not given the chance to go there; the local police found him first. Alarmed at first and imagining all sorts of things (worst of all, that he had been watched and followed, and that his secret - concerning the old devil in the ground - had been discovered), he calmed down as soon as he found out what the trouble really was: that Gregor Borowitz had been trying to track him down since the day he left Moscow and finally had succeeded. It was a wonder Dragosani hadn\u0027t been stopped at the border where he\u0027d crossed into Romania at Reni. The local law had tracked him to lonestasi, from there to Kinkovsi\u0027s, finally to Pitesti. In fact it was his Volga they\u0027d tracked: there weren\u0027t many of those in Romania. Not with Moscow plates. Finally the policeman in charge of the patrol vehicle which had stopped him apologised for any inconvenience and gave Dragosani a \u0027message\u0027 - which was simply Borowitz\u0027s Moscow telephone number, the secure line. Dragosani went with them at once to the police station and phoned from there. On the other end of the line, Borowitz came right to the point: \u0027Boris, get back here a.s.a.p.\u0027 \u0027What is it?\u0027 \u0027A member of the staff at the American embassy has had an accident while touring. A fatal accident: wrecked his car and gutted himself. We haven\u0027t identified him yet - not officially, anyway - but we\u0027ll have to do it soon. Then the Americans will want his body. I want you to see him first - in your, er, specialist capacity...\u0027 \u0027Oh? What\u0027s so important about him?\u0027 For some time now we\u0027ve suspected him and one or two others of spying. CIA, probably. If he\u0027s one of a network, it\u0027s something we should know about. So get back quickly, will you?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m on my way.\u0027 Back at Kinkovsi\u0027s Dragosani tossed his things into the car, paid what he owed and a little more, thanked Hzak and Maura and accepted sandwiches, a flask of coffee and a bottle of local wine. But for all that they gave him these parting gifts, it was obvious that Hzak had some misgivings about him. \u0027You told me you were a mortician,\u0027 he complained. \u0027The police laughed when I told them that! They said you\u0027re a big man in Moscow, an important man. It seems a great shame that an important man would want to make a fool out of a fellow countryman - an unimportant man!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry about that, my friend,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027But I am an important man and my job is very special �C and very tiring. When I come home I like to forget my work completely and just take it easy, and so I became a mortician. Please forgive me.\u0027 That seemed to suffice; Hzak Kinkovsi grinned and they shook hands, and then Dragosani got into his car. From behind her drawn curtains Use watched him drive away and breathed a sigh of relief. It was unlikely she\u0027d ever meet another like him, and maybe that was as well, but... Her bruises were blooming now but would soon fade, and anyway she could always say she had suffered a dizzy bout, tripped and fallen. The bruises would disappear, yes, but not the memory of how she had got them. She sighed again... and shivered deliciously. INTERVAL ONE: On the top floor of a well-known London hotel, in a suite of private offices, Alec Kyle sat at the desk of his ex-boss and scribbled frantically in shorthand. The \u0027ghost\u0027 (he couldn\u0027t help thinking of it that way) which stood facing him across the desk had been speaking rapidly, in soft, well-modulated tones, for more than two and a half hours now. Kyle\u0027s wrist felt cramped; his head ached from the myriad weird pictures implanted there; he had no doubt at all but that the \u0027ghost\u0027 spoke the truth, the whole truth, and etc ... As to how it (he!) knew these matters he so fluently related, or why he related them - who is to say what knowledge such a creature should or shouldn\u0027t have and tell? But one thing Kyle knew for certain was this: that the information to which he now found himself privy was vastly important, and that he must also consider himself privileged to be the medium through which it was imparted. As a pain suddenly shot up his forearm from his wrist, causing him to drop his pencil and clutch at his hand as it went into a brief spasm, so his unearthly visitor paused. It was as good a juncture as any, Kyle thought, and he was grateful. He massaged his hand and wrist for a minute, then took up a sharpener and renewed the pencil\u0027s point for what must be the ninth or tenth time at least. \u0027Why not use a pen?\u0027 the ghost asked, in such a perfectly natural and inquiring tone that Kyle found himself answering without even considering that he talked to something far less substantial than smoke. \u0027I prefer pencils. Always have. Just a quirk, I suppose. Anyway, they don\u0027t run out of ink! I\u0027m sorry I stopped just then, but my wrist feels mangled!\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve a way to go yet.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll manage some how.\u0027 \u0027Look, go and get yourself another coffee. Have a cigarette. I realise how strange all this must be for you. It\u0027s strange for me, too - but if I were you my nerves would be leaping! I think you\u0027re doing remarkably well. And we\u0027re getting on fine. I was fully prepared, before I came here, to allow several visits just to let you adjust to me. So as you can see, we\u0027re well ahead.\u0027 \u0027Yes, well it\u0027s time that\u0027s worrying me,\u0027 Kyle answered, lighting up and drawing luxuriously on the smoke, saturating his lungs with it. \u0027You see, I\u0027ve a meeting to attend at 4:00 p.m. It\u0027s then that I\u0027m to try to convince some rather important people that they keep the branch open and allow me to take over from Sir Keenan and run it. So you see, I\u0027d like to be finished before then.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t let it concern you,\u0027 the other smiled his wan smile. \u0027Consider them convinced.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 Kyle got up and went through into the main office, put money into the coffee machine. This time the ghost followed him, stood behind him. When he turned from the machine it was there, office furniture visible right through it. It was less than a holograph, less than a bubble, ectoplasm. Kyle started and slopped a little coffee, edged around the other and went back into Gormley\u0027s office. \u0027Yes,\u0027 the ghost continued, back where it had been, \u0027I believe we\u0027ll be able to \"sway\" your superiors in your favour.\u0027 \u0027We?\u0027 said Kyle. The other merely shrugged. \u0027We\u0027ll see. Anyway, I want to tell you a little more about Harry Keogh now, before returning to Dragosani. Sorry to jump about like this, but it\u0027s better if you see a complete picture.\u0027 \u0027Anything you say.\u0027 \u0027Are you ready?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 Kyle took up his pencil. \u0027Except...\u0027 \u0027Well?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s just that I was wondering where you fit into all of this?\u0027 \u0027Me?\u0027 the ghost raised its eyebrows. \u0027I suppose I\u0027d have been disappointed if you hadn\u0027t asked. Since you have: if things work out the way I hope, I\u0027ll be your future boss!\u0027 Kyle\u0027s face twitched and he grinned lopsidedly. \u0027A ... ghost? My future boss?\u0027 \u0027I thought we\u0027d been through that once,\u0027 said the other. \u0027I\u0027m not a ghost and never have been. Though I\u0027ll admit I came pretty close. But we\u0027ll get to that, you\u0027ll see.\u0027 Kyle nodded. \u0027Can we get on now?\u0027 And Kyle nodded again.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-necroscope-1/page-7.html","bookId":2436,"book":{"id":2436,"title":"Necroscope (Necroscope #1)","description":"Storyline: Harry is an English youth in school, and strange things occur as he grows up, such as a sudden increased intellect in mathematics, and the ability to fight beyond his experience after a teacher is killed.
