{"id":78773,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Across Giresci\u0027s waistcoat he wore a chain of gold. Now he took from the left-hand waistcoat pocket a silver fob watch completely out of keeping with the antique chain, and from the right the medallion of which he had spoken, holding the jewellery up for Dragosani\u0027s inspection. Dragosani caught his breath and held it, ignored the watch and chain but took hold of the medallion and stared at it. On one face of the disc he saw a highly stylised heraldic cross which could only be that of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, but which had been scored through again and again with some sharp instrument and thoroughly defaced; and on the other side -\\n\\n Somehow Dragosani had expected it. In harsh, almost crude bas-relief, a triple device: that of the devil, the bat, and the dragon. He knew the motif only too well, and the question it prompted came out in a rush of breath which surprised him more than Giresci:\\n\\n \u0027Have you tracked this down?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The device, its heraldic significance? I have tried. It has a significance, obviously, but I\u0027ve so far failed to discover the origin of this specific coat or chapter. I can tell you something of the symbolism, in local history, of the dragon and the bat; but as for the devil motif, that is rather... obscure. Oh, I know what / make of it, all right, but that\u0027s a personal thing and purely conjectural, with little or nothing to sub-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Dragosani impatiently cut him off. \u0027That wasn\u0027t my meaning. I know the motif well enough. But what of the man - or creature - who gave you the medallion?\\n\\n Were you able to trace his history?\u0027 He stared at the other, eager for the answer without quite knowing what had prompted the question. Asking it had been an almost involuntary action, the words simply springing from his tongue - as if they\u0027d been waiting there for some trigger.\\n\\n Giresci nodded, took back the medallion, watch and chain. \u0027It\u0027s curious, I know,\u0027 he said, \u0027but after an experience like mine you\u0027d think I\u0027d steer clear of all such stuff, wouldn\u0027t you? You certainly wouldn\u0027t think it would start me off on all those long years of private search and research. But that\u0027s what it did; and where better to start, as you seem to have worked out for yourself, than with the name and family and history of the creature I had destroyed that night? First his name: it was Faethor Ferenczy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ferenczy?\u0027 Dragosani repeated, almost tasting the word. He leaned forward, his fingertips white where they pressed down on the table between them. The name meant something to him, he felt sure. But what? \u0027And his family?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Giresci seemed surprised at something. \u0027You don\u0027t find the name peculiar? Oh, the surname is common enough, I\u0027ll grant you - it\u0027s chiefly Hungarian. But Faethor?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What of it?\u0027\\n\\n Giresci shrugged. \u0027I only ever came across it on one other occasion: a ninth-century White Khorvaty prince ling. His surname was pretty close, too: Ferrenzig.\u0027\\n\\n Ferenczy, Ferrenzig, thought Dragosani. One and the same. And then he checked himself. Why on earth should he jump to a conclusion like that? And yet at the same time he knew that he had not merely \u0027jumped to a conclusion\u0027 but that he had known the duality of the Wamphyri identity for a fact. Dual identity? But surely that too was a conclusion drawn in haste. He had meant that the names were the same, not the men, or man, who had borne the names. Or had he in fact meant more than that? If so it was an insane conclusion - that those two Faethors, one a ninth-century Khorvatian prince and the other a modern Romanian landowner, should be one and the same man - or should be insane, except that Dragosani knew from the old Thing in the ground that the concept of vampiric and undead longevity was far from insane.\\n\\n \u0027What else did you learn of him?1 he finally broke the silence. \u0027What about his family? Surviving members, I mean. And his history, other than this tenuous Khorvaty link?\u0027\\n\\n Giresci frowned and scratched his head. \u0027Talking to you\u0027 he growled, \u0027is an unrewarding, even frustrating game. I keep getting this feeling that you already know most of the answers. That perhaps you know even more than I do. It\u0027s as if you merely use me to confirm your own well-established beliefs...\u0027 He paused for a moment, and when Dragosani offered no reply, continued: \u0027Anyway, as far as I\u0027m aware Faethor Ferenczy was the last of his line. None survive him.\u0027\\n\\n Then you\u0027re mistaken!\u0027 Dragosani snapped. He at once bit his lip and lowered his voice. \u0027I mean... you can\u0027t be sure of that.\u0027\\n\\n Giresci was taken aback. \u0027Again you know better than me, eh?\u0027 He had been drinking Dragosani\u0027s whisky steadily but seemed little affected. Again he poured shots before suggesting: \u0027Let me tell you just exactly what I found out about this Ferenczy, yes?\\n\\n The war was over by the time I got started. As for making a living: I couldn\u0027t complain. I had my own place, right here, and was \"compensated\" for my lost leg. This plus a small disability pension rounded things off; I would get by. Nothing luxurious, but I wouldn\u0027t starve or go in need of a roof over my head. My wife - well, she had been another victim of the war. We had no family and I never remarried.\\n\\n \u0027As to how I became engrossed with the vampire legend: I suppose it was mainly that I had nothing else to do. Or nothing else that I wanted to do. But this drew me like some monstrous magnet...\\n\\n \u0027All right, I won\u0027t bore you; I explain all of this simply to put you in the picture. And as you know, my investigations started with Faethor Ferenczy. I went back to where it had happened, talked to people who might have known him. Most of that neighbourhood had been reduced to rubble but a few houses still stood. The actual Ferenczy house was just a shell, blackened inside and out, with nothing at all to show who or what had lived there.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, I had his name from various sources: postal services, Lands and Property Registry, missing-believed-dead list, war casualty register, etc. But other than this handful of responsible authorities, no one seemed to know him personally. Then I found an old woman still living in the district, a Widow Luorni. Some fifteen years before the war she\u0027d worked for Ferenczy, had been his cleaner lady. She went in twice weekly and kept his place in good order. She\u0027d done that for ten years or more, until she\u0027d grown disenchanted with the work. She wouldn\u0027t say why specifically, but it was obvious to me that the trouble was Ferenczy himself, something about him. Something that had gradually grown on her until she couldn\u0027t take any more of it. At any rate, she never once mentioned his name without crossing herself. Yes, but still she managed to tell me some interesting things about him... I\u0027ll try to cut it short for you:\\n\\n \u0027There were no mirrors in his house. I know I don\u0027t have to explain the significance of that...\\n\\n \u0027The Widow Luorni never saw her employer outside the place in daylight; she never saw him outdoors at all except on two occasions, both times at evening, in his own garden.\\n\\n \u0027She never once prepared a meal for him and never saw him eat anything. Not ever. He had a kitchen, yes, but to the old lady\u0027s knowledge never used it; or if he did, then he cleared up after himself.\\n\\n \u0027He had no wife, no family, no friends. He received very little mail, was often away from home for weeks on end. He did not have a job and did not appear to do any work in the privacy of his home, but he always had money. Plenty of it. When I checked, I was unable to discover anything by way of a bank account in his name. In short, Ferenczy was a very strange, very secretive, very reclusive man ...\\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s not all, far from it. And the rest is even stranger. One morning when she went to clean, the old girl found the local police there. Three brothers, a well-known gang of burglars working out of Moreni - a brutish lot that the police had been after for years - had been apprehended at the house. Apparently they\u0027d broken into the place in the wee small hours of the morning. They had thought the house was empty: a bad mistake indeed!\\n\\n \u0027According to statements they later made to the police, Ferenczy had been dragging one of them and herding the other two to the cellar when his attention was arrested by the arrival of horsemen outside the house. Remember, in those days the local police still used horses in the more isolated regions. It was them, all right; they had been alerted by reports of prowlers in the area, the brothers, of course. And never were three criminals more glad to be given over into the hands of the law!\\n\\n Thugs they were, by all means, but they\u0027d been no match for Faethor Ferenczy. Each of them had a broken right arm and a broken left leg, and their intended victim was responsible! Think of his strength Dragosani! The police were too grateful to him to go into the matter too deeply, Widow Luorni said - and after all, he had only been protecting his life and property - but she was there when the brothers were carted away a few hours later, and it was plain to her that her employer had scared the daylights out of them.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, I\u0027ve said that Ferenczy was in the act of taking his captives to the cellar. For what purpose? A place to detain them until help arrived? Possibly\\n\\n \u0027Or a place to keep them, like a cool pantry, until they were... required, eh?\u0027 said Dragosani.\\n\\n Giresci nodded. \u0027Exactly! Anyway, shortly after that the Widow stopped working there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm!\u0027 Dragosani mused. \u0027It surprises me he let her go. I mean, she must have suspected something. You said yourself that she was \"disenchanted\", that a feeling of unease had grown in her until she could take no more. Wouldn\u0027t he worry that she\u0027d talk about him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 Giresci answered. \u0027But you\u0027ve forgotten something, Dragosani. What about the way he controlled me -with his eyes and his mind - on the night of the bombing, the night he died?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hypnotism,\u0027 said the other at once.\\n\\n Giresci smiled grimly, nodded. \u0027It is an art of the vampire, one of many. He simply commanded her that so long as he lived she would remain silent. While he lived, she would simply forget all about him, forget that she had ever seen anything sinister in him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Dragosani.\\n\\n \u0027And so strong was his power,\u0027 the other continued, \u0027that she actually did forget - until I questioned her about him all those years later. For, of course, by then Ferenczy was dead.\u0027\\n\\n Giresci\u0027s manner was beginning to irritate Dragosani. The man\u0027s air of self-satisfaction - his smugness - his obviously high opinion of his own detective skills. \u0027But of course this is all conjecture,\u0027 the necromancer finally said. \u0027You don\u0027t know any of it for a certainty.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, but I do,\u0027 answered the other at once. \u0027I know it from the Widow herself. Now don\u0027t get me wrong: I\u0027m not saying that she simply volunteered all of this. It wasn\u0027t that we had a good gossip session or anything like that. Far from it. No, for I had to really sit down with her and ask her about him, repeatedly, until I\u0027d dug it all out. He was dead and his power gone, certainly, but still something of it lingered over, do you see?\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani grew thoughtful. His eyes narrowed a little. Suddenly, surprisingly, he felt threatened by this man. He was too clever by far, this Ladislau Giresci. Dragosani resented him - and at once wondered why. He found it hard to understand his own feelings, the sudden surge of emotion within. It was too enclosed in here, claustrophobic. That must be it. He shook his head, sat up straighter, tried to concentrate. \u0027Of course, the Widow is long dead now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes-years ago.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So you and I, we\u0027re the only ones who know anything at all about Faethor Ferenczy?\u0027\\n\\n Giresci peered at the younger man. Dragosani\u0027s voice had sunk so low that it was little more than a growl, almost sinister. There seemed something wrong with him. Even under Giresci\u0027s questioning gaze he gave himself another shake, rapidly blinking his eyes.\\n\\n That\u0027s right,\u0027 Giresci answered, frowning. \u0027I\u0027ve told no one else in - oh, longer than I can remember. No point telling anyone else, for who\u0027d believe? But are you all right, my friend? Are you well? Is something bothering you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me?\u0027 Dragosani found himself leaning forward, as if drawn towards Giresci. He deliberately forced himself upright in his chair. \u0027No, of course not. I\u0027m a little drowsy, that\u0027s all. My meal, I suppose. The good food you\u0027ve served me. Also, I\u0027ve driven a long way in the last few days. Yes, that\u0027s it: I\u0027m tired.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re sure?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, quite sure. But go on, Giresci, don\u0027t stop now. Please tell me more. About Ferenczy and his forebears. About the Ferrenzigs. The Wamphyri in general. Tell me anything else you know or suspect. Tell me everything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Everything? It could take a week, longer!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have a week,\u0027 Dragosani answered.\\n\\n \u0027Damn, I believe you\u0027re serious!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well now, Dragosani, doubtless you\u0027re a nice enough young fellow, and it\u0027s good to talk to someone who\u0027s genuinely interested and knows something about one\u0027s subject - but what makes you think I\u0027d care to spend a whole week like that? At my age time\u0027s important. Or maybe you think I have the same kind of longevity Ferenczy had, eh?\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani smiled, but thinly. On the point of saying, you can talk to me here or in Moscow, he checked himself. That wasn\u0027t necessary. Not yet, anyway. And it might let Borowitz in on his big secret: how he came to be a necromancer in the first place. \u0027Then how about the next hour or two?\u0027 he compromised. \u0027And, since you\u0027ve suggested it, we can start with Ferenczy\u0027s longevity.\u0027\\n\\n Giresci chuckled. \u0027Fair enough. Anyway, there\u0027s whisky left yet!\u0027 He poured himself another shot, made himself comfortable. And after a moment\u0027s thought:\\n\\n \u0027Ferenczy\u0027s longevity. The near-immortality of the vampire. Let me tell you something else the Widow Luorni\\n\\n said. She said that when she was a small girl, her grandmother had remembered a Ferenczy living in the same house. And her grandmother before her! Nothing strange about that, though - son follows father, right? There were plenty of old Boyar families round here whose names went back to time immemorial. There still are. What\u0027s strange is this: to the Widow\u0027s knowledge there had never been any female Ferenczys. And how does a man pass on his name if he never takes a wife, eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And of course you looked into it,\u0027 said Dragosani.\\n\\n \u0027I did. Records were scarce, however, for the war had destroyed a great deal. But certainly the house had been the seat of the Ferenczys as far back as I could trace it, and never a woman among \u0027em! A celibate lot, eh?\u0027\\n\\n Without understanding his outrage, Dragosani suddenly felt that he himself had been insulted. Or perhaps it was only his natural intelligence which felt slighted. \u0027Celibate?\u0027 he said stiffly. \u0027I think not.\u0027\\n\\n Giresci nodded. In fact he was well aware of the Wamphyri\u0027s rapacious nature. \u0027No, of course not,\u0027 he confirmed Dragosani\u0027s denial. \u0027What? A vampire celibate? Ridiculous? Lust is the very force that drives him. Universal lust - for power, flesh, blood! But listen to this:\\n\\n \u0027In 1840 one Bela Ferenczy set off across the Meridi-onali to visit a cousin or other relative in the mountains of the northern Austro-Hungarian borders. Now this much is well documented; indeed, old Bela seems to have gone to a deal of trouble to let people know he was going visiting. He installed a man to look after the place while he was away - not a local man, incidentally, but someone of gypsy stock - hired a coach and driver for the early stages of the journey, made reservations for connections through the high passes, and completed all of the preparations necessary to travel in these parts in those days.\\n\\n And he put it about locally that this was to be a journey of valediction. He had seemed to grow very old very quickly in the last year or two, and so it was accepted that he went to say his last farewells to distant relatives.\\n\\n \u0027Now remember, we were still very much Moldavia-Wallachia at that time. In Europe the Industrial Revolution was in full swing - everywhere but here! Insular as ever, we were so backward as to seem almost retarded! The Lemberg-Galatz railway, skirting the mountains, was still more than a decade away. News travelled extremely slowly, and records were hard to keep. I mention this to highlight the fact that in this case there was good communication, and that a record did survive.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Case?\u0027 Dragosani queried. \u0027What case are you talking about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The case of Bela Ferenczy\u0027s sudden death when his coach and horses were hurled into a precipice by an avalanche in one of the high passes! News of the \"accident\" got swiftly back here; the old man\u0027s Szgany retainer took Ferenczy\u0027s sealed will to the local registrar; the will was posted without delay, showing that the Ferenczy house and grounds were to pass to a \"cousin\", one Giorg, who had, apparently, already been appraised of the situation and his inheritance.\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani nodded. \u0027And of course this Giorg Ferenczy later turned up and took possession. He would be - or he would appear to be - younger far than Bela, but the family resemblance would be unquestionable.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good!\u0027 Giresci barked. \u0027You follow my reasoning precisely. Having lived here for fifty years, which would normally make him an old man, Bela had decided it was high time he \"died\" and made way for the next in line.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And after Giorg?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Faethor, of course,\u0027 Giresci scratched his chin reflectively. \u0027I\u0027ve often wondered,\u0027 he said, \u0027if I had not killed\\n\\n him on the night of the bombing - if he had survived that night - what his next incarnation would have been? Would he have shown up after the war in some new Ferenczy guise, to rebuild the house and carry on as before? I think the answer is probably yes. They are territorial, the Wamphyri.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And so you\u0027re convinced that Bela, Giorg, and Faethor were all one and the same?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course. I thought that was understood. Didn\u0027t he tell me as much himself, when he raved of the battles at Silistria and Constantinople? And before Bela there was Grigor, Karl, Peter and Stefan - oh, and the Lord knows how many others - all the way back to Faethor Ferrenzig the princeling and probably beyond! This was his territory, do you see? He held bloody dominion here. And in the olden times, as princelings or Boyars, my God but the Wamphyri were fierce about their holdings! That was why he joined the Fourth Crusade, to keep olden and future enemies off his lands. His lands, you understand? No matter what king or government or system is in power, the vampire considers his home ground to be his. He fought to protect himself, his monstrous heritage, and not for a mangy pack of scummy foreigners out of the West! You\u0027ve seen the defaced Crusader cross on the reverse of my medallion - hah! When they dishonoured him he scorned them, spat on them!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And have you actually traced his name that far back? To Constantinople, I mean, in 1204?\u0027 Something of his awe of the vampire - or his envy? - was evident in Dragosani\u0027s voice.\\n\\n Giresci cocked his head a little on one side; \u0027Dragosani, how\u0027s your history?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hardly brilliant. Fair, I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm! Well, many names came down from the Fourth Crusade, but you\u0027ll be hard put to find a Ferenczy or Ferrenzig amongst them. He was there, though, be sure of it! How do I know? Well, it\u0027s possible that you\u0027re talking to the world\u0027s foremost authority on that particular bloodbath, and I\u0027ve discovered things which I\u0027m sure many other historians have overlooked. Of course, I had the advantage of knowing what I was looking for - my objectives were specific - but in the process of tracking down the vampire I\u0027ve naturally covered a deal of extraneous ground. Man, I could write a book on the Fourth Crusade - certainly from Hungary to Constantinople! And talking of Constantinople: Lord, what a hell that must have been! What a battle! And sure enough, right there in the thick of it - wherever the fighting raged fiercest - there was this man and the brutish horde he commanded. He was there too when the city fell, when he and his band of mercenary berserkers rampaged, utterly out of control. Yes, and his excesses spread like a cancer; the entire army joined in; they raped, pillaged and massacred for three long days...\\n\\n Tope Innocent III had called the Crusade; now, aghast at what it had turned into, he was unable to regain control. The Crusaders had vowed to take the Holy Land, but Innocent and his legate were obliged to absolve them from that vow. He as good as washed his hands of the affair; but in secret communiqu��s he exercised what little control remained to him, ordering that those directly responsible for \"gross acts of excessive and unnatural cruelty\" must gain \"neither glory nor rich reward\" for their barbarism but that \"their names shall not be mentioned, nor shall they be offered respect or high regard\".\\n\\n \u0027Well, no need to look far for a scapegoat: a certain \"bloodthirsty Wallach recruited in Zara\" would fit the bill nicely. Nor was he blameless. At first the Crusaders had honoured and elevated him - perhaps, secretly, they\u0027d even envied or feared him - but now he found himself stripped of all honours and disgraced, and his name was stricken from all records. In return he scorned them for their duplicity, and defacing the sigil of their campaign -the cross on his medallion - he took his band and went home, proud and fierce under the banner of the devil, the bat and the dragon.\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani chewed on his lip for a moment before saying: \u0027Let\u0027s assume that to all intents and purposes all of this is true, or at least based on the truth to the best of your knowledge. Still there are several important questions remaining to be answered.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Such as?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ferenczy was a vampire. A vampire takes victims. When the hunger is on him he\u0027ll kill as ruthlessly as a fox kills chickens, and just as thoughtlessly. Yet it seems his sheet was clean. How could he possibly live here through all those centuries without once arousing suspicion? Remember, Ladislau Giresci, the blood is the life! Were there no cases of vampirism?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Around Ploiesti? None - not one - not as long as they\u0027ve kept records, so far as I can discover.\u0027 Giresci smiled grimly and leaned forward. \u0027But if you were a vampire, Dragosani, would you take victims right on your own doorstep?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t suppose I would,\u0027 Dragosani frowned. \u0027Where, then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027North, my friend, in the Meridionali itself! Where else but the Transylvanian Alps, where all vampire stories seem to have their roots? Slanic and Sinaia in the foothills, Brasov and Sacele beyond the pass. And none of them more than fifty miles distant from Ferenczy\u0027s house, and all shunned for their evil reputations.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What, even now?\u0027 Dragosani feigned surprise, but he remembered what Maura Kinkovsi had had to say on the subject three years ago.\\n\\n \u0027Stories linger down the years, Dragosani. Especially ghost stories. They take no chances, the mountain folk. If you die young up there and there\u0027s no simple explanation, it\u0027s the stake for you for sure! As to actual case histories: the last child to die of a vampire\u0027s bite did so in Slanic in the winter of forty-three. Yes, and she was buried with a stake through her heart, like a great many \u0027innocents before her. What? There had been eleven that year alone, in the villages around!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In forty-three, you say?\u0027\\n\\n Giresci nodded. \u0027Oh, yes, and I see you\u0027ve already made the connection. That\u0027s right, it was just a few months before Ferenczy died. She was his last victim, or at least the last we know of. Of course, with the war going on he\u0027d be far less restricted, his victims more readily disposed of. He may well have taken many we don\u0027t know about, people who simply \"went missing\" during air-raids in the countryside around - and there were plenty of those, believe me.\u0027 He paused. \u0027Any more questions?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You said that those towns you named were up in the mountains, fifty miles from Ploiesti. That\u0027s rough country; the ground rises rapidly, through two thousand feet in places; so how did Ferenczy do it? Did he become a bat and fly to his hunting grounds?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Folklore says he has that power. Bat, wolf, wraith -even flea, bug, spider! But ... I think not. There\u0027s no hard evidence anywhere to be found. But you ask, how did he get to his kill? I don\u0027t know. I have my own ideas ... but no proof at all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What ideas?\u0027 Dragosani asked, and waited half-anxiously for Giresci to answer. He already knew the correct answer to the question - or believed he did - but now he would discover just how clever Giresci really was. And how dangerous... What? He once again propped himself upright in his chair. What the hell was going wrong with his thought processes?\\n\\n \u0027A vampire,\u0027 the other slowly answered, carefully for mulating his thoughts, \u0027is not human. I saw enough on the night Ferenczy died to convince me of that. So what is he? He is an alien creature, a co-habitant of man\u0027s body and mind. He is at best symbiotic, a gestalt-creature, and at worst a parasite, a hideous lamprey.\u0027\\n\\n Correct! Dragosani snapped his agreement - but silently, to himself. And at once he felt dizzy and confused. He had known for a fact that Giresci was right in his assessment of the vampire - but how had he known? And even as he wondered what was happening to him, now Dragosani heard himself say:\\n\\n \u0027But isn\u0027t he supernatural? Surely he would need to be, to go about his business and still escape detection down all the years.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not supernatural, no,\u0027 Giresci shook his head. \u0027Super human! Hypnotic, magnetic! Creature of illusion, in no way a magician but in every way a great trickster! Not a bat but silent as a bat! Not a wolf, but swift as a wolf! Not a flea but a monster with a flea\u0027s appetite for blood - on a scale unprecedented! That\u0027s my idea of the vampire, Dragosani. Fifty miles to a creature like that? A healthy evening\u0027s walk! He would be able to compel his human shell to excesses of effort undreamed of...\u0027\\n\\n All correct, all of it, Dragosani mentally agreed, and out loud: The name, Ferenczy. You say it\u0027s common enough. Why, being so clever, and taking into account all your research and what have you, haven\u0027t you tracked down other Ferenczys? You say that the vampire is territorial, and this region belonged to Faethor. Surely then there must have been other territories - and who lords or lorded it over them, eh?\u0027\\n\\n His voice was a rasp, harsh as a file. Once more Giresci\\n\\n was a little taken aback. \u0027Why, you\u0027ve pre-empted me!\u0027 he finally answered. \u0027Shrewd stuff, Dragosani. Very astute. If Faethor Ferenczy had single-handedly held Moldavia and eastern Transylvania in his thrall for seven hundred years and more, what of the rest of Romania? Is that what you\u0027re saying?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Romania, Hungary, Greece - wherever vampires still dwell.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\"Still\" dwell, Dragosani? God forbid!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have it your own way,\u0027 Dragosani snapped. \u0027Where they used to dwell, then.\u0027\\n\\n Giresci drew back from him a little way. \u0027A Castle Ferenczy in the Alps blew itself right off the mountain back in the late Twenties. That was put down to marsh-gas, methane, accumulated in the vaults and dungeons. An ill-regarded place, no one missed it. Anyway, so far as is known, its owner went with it. A baron or count or some such, his name was Janos Ferenczy. But documentation? History? Records? Forget it! That one\u0027s page in history has been erased even more surely than old Faethor\u0027s in the Fourth Crusade. Which in my book, of course, only serves to make him more suspect.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Rightly so,\u0027 Dragosani agreed at once. \u0027He was blown to hell, eh, old Janos? Good! And have you tracked down any other vampires, Ladislau Giresci? Come, tell me now: were there no Ferenczys who paid for their crimes and were put down in their heyday? How say you? What of the Western Carpatii, say beyond the Oltul?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eh? But that should be familiar ground for you, Dragosani,\u0027 said the other. \u0027You were born there, after all. Knowing as much as you do, and being so \"clever\" in your own right - yes, and with this keen interest of yours in vampires - surely by now you\u0027ll have made your own investigations and searches?\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani nodded. \u0027Indeed, indeed! And five hundred years ago in the west there was such a creature; he butchered the vile Turk in his thousands and was slain for his so-called \"unnatural\" zest!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good!\u0027 Giresci thumped the table, no longer seeming to notice the change which had come over his guest. \u0027Yes, you\u0027re right: his name was Thibor, a powerful Boyar, destroyed in the end by the Vlads. He had great power over his Szekely followers - too much power - so that the princes feared and were jealous of him. Also, it\u0027s likely they suspected he was one of the Wamphyri. It\u0027s only us modern, sophisticated men who doubt such things. The primitive and the barbarian, they know better.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What else do you know of this one?\u0027 Dragosani growled.\\n\\n \u0027Not much,(Giresci gulped more whisky, his eyes less sharp and his breath beginning to reek,) \u0027not yet. He\u0027s to be my next project. I know that he was executed -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Murdered!\u0027 Dragosani cut in.\\n\\n \u0027Murdered, then - somewhere west of the river, below lonesti, and that he was staked and buried in a secret place, but -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And was he decapitated, too, this Thibor?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eh? I found no records to that effect. I -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He was not!\u0027 Dragosani hissed from between clenched teeth. \u0027They weighted him down with silver and iron chains, put a stake in his vitals and entombed him. But they let him keep his head. You of all people should know what that means, Ladislau Giresci. He was not dead. He was undead. He still is!\u0027\\n\\n Giresci struggled upright in his chair. Finally he had sensed that something was desperately wrong. His eyes had been a little glazed but now they came back into focus. Seeing the snarl on Dragosani\u0027s face, he began to tremble and pant. \u0027It\u0027s far too dim in here,\u0027 he gasped.\\n\\n Tar too close...\u0027 And he reached out a fluttering hand\\n\\n to swing back a shutter on the window. The sun at once streamed in.\\n\\n Dragosani had risen to his feet, was leaning forward in a half-crouch. Now his hand reached across the table and trapped Giresci\u0027s wrist in a band of steel-like fingers. His grip was ferocious. \u0027Your next project, you old fool? And if you had found him - found the vampire\u0027s grave - what then, eh? Old Faethor showed you how to do it, didn\u0027t he? And would you do it again, Ladislau Giresci?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What? Are you mad?\u0027 Giresci drew back more yet, inadvertently dragging the younger man\u0027s hand and arm into the beam of sunlight. Dragosani at once released him, snatched himself upright and reeled away into the room\u0027s cool shadows. He had felt the sunlight on his arm like acid, and in that moment he had known!\\n\\n \u0027Thibor!\u0027 he spat the word out like a vile taste. \u0027You!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Man, you\u0027re ill!\u0027 Giresci was struggling to stand up.\\n\\n \u0027You old bastard - you old devil - you ancient Thing in the earth! You would have used me!\u0027 Dragosani raved, as if to himself. But in the back of his mind, at the edge of his awareness, something chuckled evilly and shrank back, shrank down.\\n\\n \u0027You need a doctor!\u0027 Giresci gasped. \u0027A psychiatrist, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani ignored him. He understood all now. He crossed to the small occasional table, took up his gun from where he\u0027d placed it, jammed it firmly into its under-arm holster. He made to stride from the room, stopped and turned back. Giresci cringed away from him as he approached.\\n\\n Too much!\u0027 the oldster was babbling. \u0027You know far too much. I don\u0027t know who you are, but - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listen to me,\u0027 said Dragosani.\\n\\n \u0027 - I don\u0027t even know what you are! Dragosani, I - \u0027\\n\\n Dragosani back-handed him, bruising his mouth and jerking his head round on his scrawny neck. \u0027Listen, I said!\u0027\\n\\n When Giresci turned his watering eyes back to Dragosani, they had gone wide with shock. \u0027I... I\u0027m listening.\u0027\\n\\n Two things,\u0027 Dragosani told him. \u0027One: you will tell no one else about Faethor Ferenczy or what you\u0027ve discovered of him. Two: you will never mention the name of Thibor Ferenczy again, or ever attempt to learn more than you already know of him. Is this understood?\u0027\\n\\n Giresci nodded, and in the next second his eyes went wider still. \u0027Y - you?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Dragosani laughed, however shrilly. \u0027Me? Man, if I were Thibor you\u0027d be dead now. No, but I know of him -and now he knows of you!\u0027 He turned towards the door, paused and tossed back over his shoulder: \u0027It\u0027s possible you\u0027ll be hearing from me. Till then, goodbye. And Giresci - mark well what I\u0027ve said.\u0027\\n\\n Leaving the house and moving into sunlight, Dragosani groaned and gritted his teeth... but the sun did him no harm. Still, he doubted if he would ever feel entirely comfortable under its rays again. It was not Dragosani who had felt the sun\u0027s sting in Giresci\u0027s house but Thibor, the old devil in the ground. Thibor, who in that moment of time had been ascendant, in control! But even knowing that it was so, still Dragosani was glad to get out of the direct sunlight and into his car. The interior of the big Volga was like a furnace, but the heat was in no way supernatural. As Dragosani wound the windows down and pulled away, heading for the main road, so the temperature dropped and he breathed easier.\\n\\n And only then did he reach into his mind to dig out the leech-thing which was still hiding there. For he knew that if Thibor could reach him, then surely he could reach Thibor.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes, I know your name now, old devil,\u0027 he said. It was you, Thibor, wasn\u0027t it, back there at Giresci\u0027s? It was you, guiding my tongue, asking him those questions?\u0027\\n\\n For a moment there was nothing. Then:\\n\\n / won\u0027t deny it, Dragosani. But let\u0027s be reasonable: 1 did little to hide the fact of my presence. And no harm done. I was merely -\\n\\n \u0027 You were testing your power!\u0027 Dragosani snapped. \u0027You tried to usurp my mind! You\u0027ve been trying to do so for the last three years - and might have succeeded if I hadn\u0027t been so far away! I see it all now.\u0027\\n\\n What? Accusations? Remember, Dragosani, it was you came to me that time. Of your own free will, you invited me into your mind. You asked for my help with the woman, and I gave it willingly.\\n\\n Too willingly!\u0027 Dragosani was bitter. \u0027I hurt that girl -or you did, through me. Your lust in my body ... I could barely control it. I might easily have killed her!\u0027\\n\\n You enjoyed it. (A sly whisper.)\\n\\n \u0027No, you enjoyed it! I was carried along by it. Well, and maybe she deserved it - but I don\u0027t deserve you sneaking into my mind like a thief to steal my thoughts. And your lust has stayed in my body - which you must have known it would! My invitation wasn\u0027t permanent, old dragon. Anyway, I\u0027ve learned my lesson. You\u0027re not to be trusted. Not in any way. You\u0027re treacherous.\u0027\\n\\n What? the voice in Dragosani\u0027s head made mock of him. /, treacherous? Dragosani, I am your father...\\n\\n \u0027Father of lies!\u0027 Dragosani answered.\\n\\n How have I lied?\\n\\n \u0027In many ways. You were weak three years ago, and I brought you food. I gave you back a measure of your strength. You scorned pig\u0027s blood and said it was good only for freshening the earth. A lie! It freshened you. It gave you a lasting strength sufficient that you could reach out your mind to me even these three years later and in the full light of day! Well, I\u0027ll feed you no more. Also, you said sunlight would merely irritate you. Another lie, for I\u0027ve felt how it burns you. And how many other lies have you told to me? No, Thibor, you do nothing except for your own advantage. I always guessed it, but now I know for sure.\u0027\\n\\n And what will you do about it? (Did Dragosani detect a tremor of fear in the mental voice? Was the Thing in the ground worried?)\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 he answered.\\n\\n Nothing? (Relief.)\\n\\n \u0027Nothing at all. Perhaps I made a mistake, seeking to be as you were, desiring to be one of the Wamphyri. Perhaps I\u0027ll now go away from here - and this time stay away - and let the years complete their work on you. I may have temporarily given your stinking bones something of flesh, something of life, but the centuries will take it all back again, I\u0027m sure.\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani, no! (Real fear now, panic.) Listen: I wasn\u0027t testing my power. I wasn\u0027t testing anything. Do you remember how I told you I was not unique, that others of the Wamphyri were extant even now? I said that for centuries I had waited for them to come and release or avenge me, and they came not. Do you remember that?\\n\\n \u0027Yes, what of it?\u0027\\n\\n Why, can\u0027t you see? If our roles were reversed, would you have been able to resist? You gave me the opportunity to find out about those others, to learn what had become of them. Old Faethor, who was my father, dead at last! And Janos, a brother of mine who always hated me, exploded in the gasses of what he kept in his dungeons. Aye, dead and gone, both of them - and I for one glad of it! What? Didn\u0027t they leave me rotting in the earth for half a millennium? Oh, they heard me calling down all those\\n\\n bitter nights, be sure of it - but did they come to set me free? Not them! So Ladislau Giresci fancies himself a tracker of vampires, does he? But I would have shown him how to track them, who left me to the dirt and the worms and the seep of centuries, when I rise up from this place! Ah, well, they are gone now, and my vengeance with them...\\n\\n Dragosani smiled grimly. \u0027I can\u0027t help asking myself, Thibor, why they deserted you and left you to your fate? Your own father, for instance, Faethor Ferenczy: who would know you better than him? And why did your brother, Janos, hate you so? There\u0027s more to you than meets the eye, eh, Thibor? A black sheep among vampires! Who ever heard of such a thing? But why not? -you yourself have mentioned your excesses more than once. And I have personal recollections of them. Do the things you\u0027ve done bother even your conscience? Or are the Wamphyri, and you in particular, without conscience?\u0027\\n\\n You make much of very little, Dragosani.\\n\\n \u0027Oh? I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m only just beginning to learn about you, Thibor. When you aren\u0027t lying outright, then you\u0027re obscuring the truth. It\u0027s the way you are; you don\u0027t know any other way.\u0027\\n\\n The vampire was furious. You find it easy to insult me because you know I may not strike you! How have I obscured the truth?\\n\\n \u0027How? Haven\u0027t you said that I \"gave\" you the opportunity to discover what had become of these kin of yours? But in fact you made your own opportunity. It wasn\u0027t my intention when I started out from Moscow to go to the library in Pitesti, Thibor, so who put that thought in my head again, eh? And when you learned of Ladislau Giresci, why, I just had to go and see him, didn\u0027t I?\u0027\\n\\n Listen, Dragosani -\\n\\n \u0027No, you listen. You used me. Used me just as the vampire of popular fiction uses his human vassals, just as you used your Szekely serfs five hundred years ago. But I\u0027m no serf, Thibor Ferenczy, and that\u0027s your big mistake. It\u0027s one you\u0027ll come to regret, too.\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani, I -\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll hear no more talk, old dragon, not from your forked tongue. There\u0027s only one thing you can do for me now: get yourself out of my mind!\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani\u0027s mind was fully developed now, trained, sharp as one of his own scalpels. Case-hardened by the necromancy which this very vampire had inspired in him, its cutting edge was swift and deadly. In its action it was keener than an ordinary man\u0027s is over that of a mongol -but how strong was it? Now Dragosani put it to the test. He squeezed with his mind, thrusting the monster out, driving him away.\\n\\n Ingrate! Thibor accused, retreating. But don\u0027t think it ends here. One day you\u0027ll need me, and then you\u0027ll return. Only don\u0027t wait too long, Dragosani. A year at most, and after that put aside all thoughts of ever acquiring Wamphyri knowledge, for you\u0027ll be too late. A year, my son, and no more than a year. I\u0027ll be waiting, and perhaps by then I will... have... forgiven you... Dragosaaniiii.../\\n\\n Then he was gone.\\n\\n Dragosani relaxed, breathed deeply, suddenly felt exhausted. It had been no easy thing, exorcising Thibor. The vampire had resisted, but Dragosani had been stronger. The real problem had not lain in getting him out - it would lie in keeping him out. Or perhaps not. Now that Dragosani knew Thibor was able to secretly insinuate himself in his being, he could maintain a watch for the old devil.\\n\\n But as for his Romanian \u0027holiday\u0027: that was over before it had begun. Cursing, he savagely applied the brakes and slewed the Volga round in a half circle, then started back the way he had come. He was tired but sleep would have to wait. All Dragosani wanted now was to put distance between himself and the Thing in the ground.\\n\\n Dragosani stopped just outside Bucharest for petrol and tried to raise Thibor. It was still full daylight but he got something: a faint response, a shiver in his mind that echoed like a coffin and wriggled like a graveworm. In Braida in the dusk he tried again. The presence was stronger as night drew on. Thibor was there and might have responded if Dragosani had given him the opportunity. He did not but closed his mind and drove on. At Reni, after passing through Customs, he let down all his defences and literally invited Thibor in. It was full night now but the whisper in his mind was faint, as if it came from a million miles away:\\n\\n Dragosaaaniiii. Coward! You flee from me. An old creature trapped in the earth.\\n\\n Tm no coward, old one. And I\u0027m not fleeing but putting myself outside your range, where you can\u0027t reach me. And if you do manage to reach me, next time I\u0027ll know. You see, Thibor, you need me more than I need you. Now you can just lie there and think it over. I may come back one day and I may not. But when, if I do, it will be on my terms.\u0027\\n\\n Dragosani (the whisper was faint but urgent) I -\\n\\n \u0027Goodbye, Thibor.\u0027\\n\\n And behind him, Thibor Ferenczy\u0027s mental whisper was eaten up along with all the miles, and in a little while Dragosani felt safe to stop and sleep.\\n\\n And dream his own dreams. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-necroscope-1/page-10.html","bookId":2436,"book":{"id":2436,"title":"Necroscope (Necroscope #1)","description":"Storyline: Harry is an English youth in school, and strange things occur as he grows up, such as a sudden increased intellect in mathematics, and the ability to fight beyond his experience after a teacher is killed.
