{"id":78779,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Moscow, Friday evening, Dragosani\u0027s flat on the Pushkin Road.\n It was growing dark by the time Dragosani gratefully let himself into his flat and poured himself a drink. The trains had been maddeningly slow on the journey from Romania, and Max Batu\u0027s absence had made the return trip seem that much longer. Batu\u0027s absence, yes, and Dragosani\u0027s growing feeling of urgency, this sensation of being rushed towards some colossal confrontation. Time was quickly passing and still there remained so much for him to do. Achingly tired, still he couldn\u0027t rest. Some instinct urged him onward, warned him against pausing in his set course.\n With a second drink inside him and beginning to feel a little better, he telephoned the Chateau Bronnitsy and checked that Borowitz was still in mourning at his dacha at Zhukovka. Then he asked to speak to Igor Vlady but Vlady had already left for home. Dragosani phoned him there, asked if he could come round. The other agreed at once.\n Vlady lived in his own state flatlet not too far away but Dragosani took his car anyway; in less than ten minutes he was seated in Vlady\u0027s tiny living-room, toying with a welcoming glass of vodka.\n \u0027Well, Comrade?\u0027 Vlady finally asked when they\u0027d done with the usual formalities and preliminaries. \u0027What can I do for you?\u0027 He peered curiously, almost speculatively at Dragosani\u0027s dark glasses and gaunt grey features.\n Dragosani nodded, as if he silently confirmed some\u0026shy;thing or other, and said: \u0027I can see you\u0027ve been expecting me.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I thought I might be seeing you,\u0027 Vlady carefully answered.\n Dragosani decided against beating about the bush. If Vlady failed to produce the right answers he would simply kill him. He probably would anyway, eventually. \u0027Very well, I\u0027m here,\u0027 he said. \u0027Now tell me: how\u0027s it going to be?\u0027\n Vlady was a small dark man and normally open as a book. That was the impression he achieved, anyway. Now he raised an eyebrow, put on an expression of mild surprise. \u0027How\u0027s what going to be?\u0027 he asked, innocently.\n \u0027Look, let\u0027s not fool around,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027You probably already know exactly why I\u0027ve come here. That\u0027s what you\u0027re paid for: your ability to see things in advance. So I\u0027ll ask you again: how is it going to be?\u0027\n Vlady drew back, scowled. \u0027With Borowitz, you mean?\u0027\n \u0027For starters, yes.\u0027\n Vlady\u0027s face grew strangely impassive, almost cold. \u0027He\u0027ll die,\u0027 he said, without emotion. \u0027Tomorrow, at midday or thereabouts. A heart attack. Except -\u0027 and he paused and frowned.\n \u0027Except?\u0027\n Vlady shrugged. \u0027A heart attack,\u0027 he repeated.\n Dragosani nodded, sighed, relaxed a little. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, \u0027that\u0027s how it will be. And what about me - and you?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t do readings for myself,\u0027 said Vlady. \u0027It\u0027s tempting, of course, but far too frustrating. To know the future and not be able to change it. Also, it\u0027s frightening. As for you... that\u0027s a bit odd.\u0027\n Dragosani didn\u0027t like the sound of that. He put down his drink and leaned forward. \u0027What\u0027s odd?\u0027 he asked. This might be very important to him.\n Vlady took up both of their glasses and poured more vodka. \u0027First let\u0027s get something straight, you and I,\u0027 he said. \u0027Comrade, I\u0027m not your rival. I have no ambitions\n in respect of E-Branch. None at all. I know Borowitz had me in mind for the job - along with yourself - but I\u0027m just not interested. I think you should know that.\u0027\n \u0027You mean you\u0027ll step aside for me?\u0027\n Tm not stepping aside for anyone,\u0027 the other shook his head. \u0027I just don\u0027t want the job, that\u0027s all. I don\u0027t envy any man that job. Yuri Andropov won\u0027t rest until he\u0027s crushed the lot of us - even if it takes the rest of his lifetime! Frankly, I wish to hell I was out of it altogether. Did you know I was a trained architect, Dragosani? Well, I am. Read the future? I\u0027d far prefer to read the plans of great buildings any day.\u0027\n \u0027Why do you tell me this?\u0027 Dragosani was curious. \u0027It has nothing to do with anything.\u0027\n \u0027Yes it has. It has something to do with living. And I want to live. You see, Dragosani, I know that you will have something to do with Borowitz\u0027s death. With his \"heart attack\". And if you can tackle him and win, which you will, then what chance would I have? I\u0027m not brave, Dragosani, and I\u0027m not stupid. E-Branch is all yours...\u0027\n Again Dragosani leaned forward. His eyes were pricks of red light gleaming through the dark lenses of his spectacles. \u0027But your job is to tell Borowitz this sort of thing, Igor,\u0027 he rasped. \u0027Especially -this sort of thing. Are you saying you haven\u0027t told him? Or does he in fact already know that I\u0027ll be ... involved?\u0027\n Vlady shook himself, sat up straighter. For a moment he\u0027d felt almost hypnotised by Dragosani. The man\u0027s gaze was like that of a snake. A wolf? Something not quite human, anyway. \u0027I really don\u0027t know why I\u0027ve told you any of this,\u0027 he finally said. \u0027I mean, for all I know the old warhorse might even have sent you here!\u0027\n \u0027But wouldn\u0027t you know it if he had?\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027Isn\u0027t that something your talent would have foreseen?\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t see everything!\u0027 Vlady snapped.\n Dragosani nodded. \u0027Hmm! Well, he didn\u0027t send me.\n Now tell me \"truthfully: does he know he\u0027s going to die tomorrow? And if so, does he know that I\u0027ll be involved? Well, I\u0027m waiting...\u0027\n Vlady bit his lip, shook his head. \u0027He doesn\u0027t know,\u0027 he mumbled.\n \u0027Why haven\u0027t you told him?\u0027\n Two reasons. First, it wouldn\u0027t change anything even if he did know. Second, I hate the old bastard! I have a fianc��e and want to be married. I\u0027ve wanted it for ten years. But Borowitz says no. He needs me to keep my wits sharp. He doesn\u0027t want my talent dulled. Too much sex might ruin me, he says! Damn the old bastard - he rations me with my own fianc��e!\u0027\n Dragosani sat back and laughed out loud. Vlady saw the gape of his mouth and the length of his teeth and once more felt that he talked with some strange animal rather than a man. \u0027Oh, I can believe that!\u0027 Dragosani\u0027s laughter finally rumbled into silence. \u0027Yes, that\u0027s just typical of him. Well, Igor,\u0027 he nodded knowingly, \u0027I think you can now safely go ahead with your wedding arrangements. Yes, just as soon as you like.\u0027\n \u0027But you\u0027ll want to keep me in the branch, eh?\u0027 Vlady\u0027s tone remained sour.\n \u0027Of course I will,\u0027 Dragosani nodded. \u0027You\u0027re much too valuable to be a simple architect, Igor Vlady - and far too talented! But the branch? That is merely a beginning. There\u0027s more to life than that. After this is over I\u0027m going on and up. And you can come with me.\u0027\n Vlady\u0027s response to that was a blank stare. Suddenly Dragosani was sure he was hiding something. \u0027You were going to tell me what you\u0027ve read in my future,\u0027 he reminded. \u0027Now that we\u0027ve dealt with Borowitz, I think that would be a good idea. I think you said there was something... odd?\u0027\n \u0027Odd, yes,\u0027 Vlady agreed. \u0027But of course I could be wrong. Anyway, you\u0027ll know all about it - tomorrow.\u0027\n And he gave a nervous twitch at Dragosani\u0027s startled expression.\n \u0027What? What\u0027s that about tomorrow?\u0027 the necromancer came slowly to his feet, uncoiling from his chair. \u0027Have you been wasting my time and confusing me with trivialities when all the time you knew there was something in store for me tomorrow? When, tomorrow? And where?\u0027\n Tomorrow night - at the Chateau,\u0027 said Vlady. \u0027Some thing big, but I don\u0027t know what it will be.\u0027\n Dragosani began to pace the floor, searched his own mind for clues. \u0027KGB? Is it likely they\u0027ll find Borowitz\u0027s body that fast? I doubt it. Even if they did, why should they suspect the branch? Or me? After all, it will only have been a \"heart attack\". That could happen to anyone. Or is it someone inside the branch itself? Maybe you, Igor, having second thoughts about your loyalties?\u0027 (Vlady hastily shook his head in denial.) \u0027Will it be sabotage?\u0027 Dragosani continued to pace. \u0027And if so what form of sabotage?\u0027 He angrily shook his head. \u0027No, no, I can\u0027t see that! Damn it, come on, Igor you know more than you\u0027re saying! What is it, exactly, that you\u0027ve seen?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t seem to understand!\u0027 Vlady shouted. \u0027Man, I\u0027m not superhuman. I can\u0027t be exact all the time!\u0027 It was true and Dragosani knew it; Vlady\u0027s voice betrayed his own exasperation; he, too, wished he had an answer. \u0027Sometimes things are very vague - like that time when Andrei Ustinov got his. I knew there would be a ruckus that night and warned Borowitz about it, but I couldn\u0027t for the life of me say who or what would be involved! It\u0027s the same this time, too. There\u0027ll be big trouble tomorrow and you\u0027ll be right in the middle of it. It will come from outside and it will be ... big trouble! Of that much I\u0027m certain, but that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Not quite all,\u0027 said Dragosani, ominously. \u0027I still don\u0027t know what you meant by \"odd\". Why do you avoid the issue? Will I be in any danger?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Vlady, \u0027a great deal of danger. And not just you but everyone at the Chateau.\u0027\n \u0027Damn it, man!\u0027 Dragosani slammed his fist down on the table. \u0027You make it sound like we\u0027ll all be dead men!\u0027\n Vlady\u0027s face slowly lost some of its dark colour. He half turned his face away but Dragosani leaned over him, clasped his cheeks in the fingers of one great hand, drew his averted face and the O-shape of his quivering mouth back towards him. He looked deep into the other\u0027s frightened eyes. \u0027Are you quite sure you\u0027ve told me everything?\u0027 he asked, forming his words slowly and very carefully. \u0027Can you not at least try to explain what you meant by your use of the word \"odd\"? Is there a chance, perhaps, that you\u0027ve also foreseen my death for tomorrow?\u0027\n Vlady jerked his face free and pushed back in his chair away from Dragosani. The white pressure marks of the other\u0027s fingers faded on his cheeks, were replaced by a dark pink flush. Dragosani was capable of murder beyond a doubt. Vlady must at least try to satisfy his demands. \u0027Listen,\u0027 he said, \u0027and I\u0027ll explain as best I can. After that... you must make what you will of it.\n \u0027When I look at a man - when I try to see into his future - I normally detect a straight blue line extending forward. Like a line drawn down a sheet of paper from top to bottom. Call it his line of life, if you wish. From the length of this line I can work out the length of the man\u0027s life. From kinks and deviations which occur in it, I can determine something of future occurrences and how they will affect him. Borowitz\u0027s line ends tomorrow. At the end there is a kink which indicates a physical malfunction: his heart attack. As to how I know you will be involved: it is simply that at the end your life-line crosses his - and goes on alone!\u0027\n \u0027But for how long?\u0027 Dragosani demanded to know.\n \u0027What about tomorrow night, Igor? Is that where my line ends?\u0027\n Vlady shivered. \u0027Your line is entirely different,\u0027 he finally answered. \u0027I hardly know how to read it at all. Some six months ago Borowitz demanded that I prepare weekly readings on you for his eyes only. I tried but... it was impossible. There were so many deviations in your line that I couldn\u0027t read it with any degree of accuracy at all! Kinks and wriggles I\u0027d never come across before. Also, as the months passed, what had started out as one line began to divide, to split into two parallel lines. The new one wasn\u0027t blue but red, which was something else I had never seen before. As for the old, original line: it too slowly turned red. You are like... like twins, Dragosani. I know no other way to put it. And tomorrow -\u0027\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\n Tomorrow night one of your lines terminates...\u0027\n Half of me will die! thought Dragosani. But which half? Out loud he asked, \u0027The red or the blue?\u0027\n \u0027The red line terminates,\u0027 said Vlady.\n The vampire - dead! Dragosani\u0027s spirits soared but he controlled the laughter he felt welling inside. \u0027What of the other line?\u0027\n Vlady shook his head, patently at a loss for any reasonable explanation. Finally he said, \u0027That is the oddest thing of all. It\u0027s something I simply cannot explain. The other line loses its red tinge and forms a loop, bends back on itself, rejoins the other where the division first occurred!\u0027\n Dragosani sat down again and took up his drink. What Vlady had given him wasn\u0027t satisfactory but it was better than nothing. \u0027I\u0027ve been hard on you, Igor,\u0027 he said, \u0027and I\u0027m sorry for that. I can see you\u0027ve tried to do your best for me and I thank you. But you\u0027ve said that this thing tomorrow will be big, which tells me that you\u0027ve probably\n done readings for the others who\u0027ll be at the Chateau. So now I want to know just how big it will be?\u0027\n Vlady bit his lip. \u0027You won\u0027t like the answer, Comrade,\u0027 he warned at last.\n Tell me anyway.\u0027\n \u0027It will be very nearly total! A force - a power - will visit itself upon the Chateau Bronnitsy, and it will bring devastation.\u0027\n Keogh! It could only be Harry Keogh! No other threat existed ... Dragosani stood up, grabbed his coat, headed for the door. \u0027I have to go now, Igor,\u0027 he said. \u0027But again I thank you. I won\u0027t forget what you\u0027ve done for me tonight, believe me. And if you should see anything new, I\u0027d be obliged if-\u0027\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Vlady, breathing a sigh of relief, following him to the door; and, as Dragosani went out into the night: \u0027Comrade... what happened to Max Batu?\u0027 It was a dangerous question, but he must ask it.\n Dragosani paused just beyond the threshold, glanced back. \u0027Max? Ah, you know about him, do you? Well, it was an accident.\u0027\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Vlady with a nod. \u0027Of course...\u0027\n When he was alone again, Vlady finished off the vodka and then sat deep into the night, wrapped in his own thoughts. But as a clock tolled midnight somewhere out in the cold city he started up and shivered, and finally decided to break his own rule. Quickly he cast his mind into the future, followed his own life-line to its inevitable end. Which came in just three days\u0027 time, and with a violent, wrenching terminal squiggle!\n Automatically then, Vlady began to pack a few things and prepare to flee. And uppermost in his mind was the thought that with Borowitz gone Dragosani would be the head of E-Branch, or head of what survived. Whatever else Gregor Borowitz was, at least he was human! But Dragosani...? Vlady knew he could never serve under\n him. Oh, it could well be that Dragosani would die tomorrow night - but what if he didn\u0027t? His line was so very confusing, so very alien. No, there was only one course for Vlady now. He must try - at least try - to avoid the unavoidable.\n And almost a thousand miles away, where a dark watchtower overlooked the wall in East Berlin, a Kalashnikov machine-gun waited for Igor Vlady. He didn\u0027t know it, but even now his and the weapon\u0027s futures were bending towards each other. They would meet at exactly 10:32 p.m. - in just three days\u0027 time.\n Dragosani drove straight back to his flat. From there he phoned the Chateau and got hold of the Duty Officer. He passed on Harry Keogh\u0027s name and description for immediate transmission to border crossing points and incoming airports within the USSR, along with the information that Keogh was a spy for the West who should be arrested on sight or, if that should prove difficult, shot dead without delay. The KGB would get to know about it, of course, but Dragosani didn\u0027t mind. If they took Keogh alive they wouldn\u0027t know what to do with him, and one way or the other Dragosani would get his hands on him. And if they killed him... that would be the end of that.\n As for Vlady\u0027s predictions: Dragosani had some faith in them but it was by no means total. Vlady insisted that the future could not be changed, Dragosani thought differently. One of them must be right but they must wait until tomorrow night to find out which one. In any case, the promised \u0027trouble\u0027 at the Chateau Bronnitsy might well turn out to be nothing to do with Harry Keogh after all; and so, until then at least, things must continue according to plan.\n After passing on his information to the Chateau, Dragosani had another drink - a stiff one, which was not his normal habit - and at last fell into his bed. Exhausted, he slept right through until mid-morning...\n At 11:40 a.m. he parked his old Volga in a copse off the main road half a mile from the closest dacha, turned up the collar of his overcoat and walked the rest of the way into Zhukovka precinct. Just before noon he turned off a track inches deep in snow and walked through a strip of woodland lying parallel to the river, until he came to Borowitz\u0027s dacha. Smiling grimly, he went quickly along the paved path to the door and knocked gently on the rustic oak panels. While he waited, he sniffed at wood smoke where it hung in the bitter cold air. The fine hairs inside his nostrils crackled, but melting icicles where they hung from Borowitz\u0027s roof told him that already the temperature was rising. Soon the snow would melt and Dragosani\u0027s footprints would disappear; there would be nothing to connect him with this place.\n There came slow footsteps from within and the door cracked open. Pale, shaggy and red-eyed, Gregor Borowitz peered out, blinked in the grey light of day. \u0027Dragosani?\u0027 he frowned darkly. \u0027But I said I wasn\u0027t to be disturbed. I -\u0027\n \u0027Comrade General,\u0027 Dragosani cut in, \u0027if it wasn\u0027t a matter of the utmost urgency...\u0027\n Borowitz stepped aside, opened the door wider. \u0027Come in, come in,\u0027 he grumbled, but without his accustomed fire. He had been alone here for a week; he no longer seemed robust; his grief was very real and had left him old and tired. All of which suited Dragosani very well indeed.\n He entered, followed the other down a short corridor and through hanging curtains into the small, pine-panelled room where Natasha Borowitz lay silently in her shroud. The woman had been a peasant, pleasant enough in life but plain and dowdy in death. Like a stout, badly fashioned candle she lay there, the wax of her face wrinkled, the wick of her hair coarse and sparse. Borowitz patted her cold face and bowed his head as he turned away. But he could not hide a very real tear glittering in the corner of his eye.\n Now he led Dragosani through into the more familiar living-cum-dining room and offered him a seat close to a window. The rest of the dacha\u0027s windows were shuttered but this one\u0027s shutters stood open, letting in the light. With a silent shake of his head, Dragosani declined to sit, watched Borowitz flop heavily down on to a padded couch. \u0027I prefer to stand,\u0027 the necromancer said. \u0027This won\u0027t take long.\u0027\n \u0027A flying visit?\u0027 Borowitz grunted, scarcely interested. \u0027You might have waited, Dragosani. Tomorrow they take my Natasha away from me, and then I return to Moscow and the Chateau Bronnitsy. What is it that brings you here so urgently anyway? You told me that your trip to England was successful.\u0027\n \u0027So it was,\u0027 said Dragosani, \u0027but something has come up since then.\u0027\n \u0027Well?\u0027\n \u0027Comrade General,\u0027 said Dragosani, \u0027Gregor, I want you to ask no questions just yet but simply tell me. something. Do you remember a conversation we once had, you and I, about the future of E-Branch? You said that one day you would decide who would take over from you when you... retired. Also, you said the decision would lie between myself and Igor Vlady.\u0027\n Borowitz drew his brows together, stared at Dragosani disbelievingly. \u0027So that\u0027s why you\u0027re here!\u0027 he growled. \u0027A matter of the utmost urgency, eh? You think I\u0027m ready to step down, do you? Or maybe you think it\u0027s time I stepped down! Now that Natasha\u0027s gone, maybe I\u0027ll think of retiring, eh?\u0027 He sat up straighter, his eyes flashed something of the fire Dragosani was used to seeing in them. Except that the necromancer no longer stood in awe of this man.\n \u0027I said you should ask no questions,\u0027 he reminded, a low, dark rumble in his voice. \u0027I am the one who seeks answers, Gregor. Now tell me: who did you decide would be your replacement? Indeed, have you yet decided? And if so, have you made a record of your decision?\u0027\n Borowitz was astonished, outraged. \u0027You dare...?\u0027 he scowled, his eyes bulging. \u0027You dare...? You forget yourself, Dragosani. You forget who! am and where you are. And apparently you forget - or choose to ignore the fact - that I am recently bereaved! Well damn you, Dragosani! But in answer to your questions: no, I have committed nothing to paper - there\u0027s nothing to commit for I\u0027ll be going on as the head of E-Branch for a long time yet, I assure you. Moreover, even if I had chosen a successor, as of this moment you could erase from your mind any thoughts of yourself in that position!\u0027 He stood up, shaking with rage. \u0027Now get your damned arse out of here! Get out before I -\u0027\n Dragosani took off his dark, wide-rimmed spectacles.\n Borowitz looked at Dragosani\u0027s face and was suddenly staggered by the massive metamorphosis taken place in him. Why, it hardly seemed like Dragosani at all standing there but someone else entirely. And those eyes - those incredible scarlet eyes!\n \u0027I am retiring you, Gregor,\u0027 Dragosani rumbled. \u0027But .you don\u0027t go empty-handed. Not after so many years of faithful service.\u0027 He crouched down into himself, his shoulders and back seeming to bunch up with a grotesque life of their own.\n \u0027Retiring me?\u0027 Borowitz tried to back away from Dragosani but the couch was right behind him. \u0027You, retiring me?\u0027\n Dragosani nodded, opened his long jaws and smiled,\n displayed fangs like scythes. \u0027We have a small retirement gift for you, Gregor.\u0027 \u0027We?\u0027 Borowitz croaked.\n \u0027Me and Max Batu,\u0027 said Dragosani. And in the next moment Borowitz looked into the face of hell itself.\n Then - it was as if a mule had kicked him in the chest. He flew backward, his arms thrown wide, crashed into the wall and bounced off. Small shelves and pictures were brought crashing down. Borowitz fell, half-sprawling on the couch. He clutched at his chest, fought to take control of his rubber limbs and climb to his feet, gulped air to his straining lungs. His heart felt crushed - and if he didn\u0027t know how, at least he knew what Dragosani had done to him.\n Finally he struggled upright. \u0027Dragosani!\u0027 he held out wildly fluttering, pudgy hands towards the necromancer. \u0027Drago -\u0027\n Again Dragosani hurled his psychic bolt, and again. Borowitz was swatted like a fly by the first blast, knocked over backwards on to the couch. He actually managed to sit up, to finish the last word he would ever speak, before the second blast hit him: \u0027-sani!\u0027\n Then it was done. The ex-boss of E-Branch sat there, upright, dead as a doornail, showing all the signs of a heart attack.\n \u0027Classic!\u0027 Dragosani grunted his approval. He glanced about the room. The door of a corner cupboard stood open, displaying a battered old typewriter on a shelf with papers, envelopes and other items of stationery. He quickly carried the machine to a table, inserted a blank sheet of paper, began to type laboriously:\n I feel unwell. I think it is my heart. Natasha\u0027s death has affected me badly. I think I am finished. Since I have not yet nominated another to carry on my work, I do so now. The only man who can be trusted to carry on where I leave off is\n Boris Dragosani. He is completely faithful to the USSR, and especially to the aims and welfare of the Party Leader.\n Also, if as I fear the end is coming, I want my body put in Dragosani\u0027s care. He knows my wishes in this respect...\n Dragosani grinned as he rolled the typewritten sheet up a space or two. He read over the note, took up a pen and scrawled \u0027G.B.\u0027 as nearly as possible in the style of Borowitz at the end of the last line, then dusted the keys with his handkerchief where he\u0027d touched them and carried the machine to the couch. Sitting down beside the dead man, He took his hands and laid his fingers briefly on the keys. And all the time Borowitz watching him through sightless, popping eyes.\n \u0027All done, Gregor,\u0027 said Dragosani as he took the typewriter back to the table. Tm going now, but I\u0027ll not say goodbye just yet. After they find you we\u0027ll be meeting again, eh, at the Chateau Bronnitsy? And what price your innermost secrets then, Gregor Borowitz?\u0027\n It was 12:25 p.m. when he let himself out of the silent cabin in the trees and backtracked to his car.\n Since it was a Saturday there were fewer people about than one would usually find at the Chateau Bronnitsy, but as the guards on the outer wall checked Dragosani through, so they sent word of his arrival ahead of him. At the central cluster of buildings the Duty Officer was waiting for him. Wearing the Chateau\u0027s uniform of grey overalls with a single diagonal yellow stripe across the heart, he came breathlessly forward to greet Dragosani where he parked his Volga in its designated space.\n \u0027Good news, Comrade!\u0027 he declared, walking with Dragosani through the complex and holding a door open for him. \u0027We have word of this British agent, this Harry Keogh, for you.\u0027\n Dragosani at once grabbed him by the shoulder, his grip like a vice. The other carefully disengaged himself, stared curiously at Dragosani. \u0027Is anything wrong, Comrade?\u0027\n \u0027Not if we\u0027ve got Keogh,\u0027 Dragosani growled. \u0027No, nothing at all. But you\u0027re not the man I spoke to last night?\u0027\n \u0027No, Comrade. He has gone off duty. I read his log, that\u0027s all. And of course I was here this morning when word of Keogh came in.\u0027\n Dragosani looked more closely at the speaker. He saw him remotely. Thin and slope-shouldered, a typical nothing to look at - and yet puffed up with his own importance. Not an ESPer, the Duty Officer was simply Senior Ground Staff. A good clerk, mainly, and efficient, but a bit too pompous - too smug and self-satisfied - for Dragosani\u0027s liking.\n \u0027Come with me,\u0027 he said coldly. \u0027You can tell me about Keogh as we go.\u0027\n With the DO at his heels, Dragosani loped easily through the Chateau\u0027s corridors and began climbing stairs towards Borowitz\u0027s private office complex. Finding it hard to keep up, the man said, \u0027Slow down a little, Comrade, or I\u0027ll not have breath to tell you anything!\u0027\n Dragosani kept going. \u0027About Keogh,\u0027 he snapped over his shoulder. \u0027Where is he? Who has him? Are they bringing him here?\u0027\n \u0027No one \"has\" him, Comrade,\u0027 the other puffed. \u0027We merely know where he is, that\u0027s all. He\u0027s in East Germany, Leipzig. He got in through Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin - as a tourist! And no attempt to hide his identity, apparently. Very strange. He\u0027s been in Leipzig for three or four days now. Seems to have spent most of his time there in a graveyard! Obviously he\u0027s waiting for a contact.\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 Dragosani came to a brief halt, glared at the other, sneered at him. \u0027Obvious, did you say? Let me tell you, Comrade, that nothing is obvious about that one!\n Now, quickly, come into my office and I\u0027ll give you some instructions.\u0027\n A moment later and the DO followed Dragosani into the antechamber of Borowitz\u0027s suite. \u0027Your office?\u0027 he gaped.\n Behind his desk, Borowitz\u0027s secretary, a young man with thick-lensed spectacles, thin eyebrows and a prema\u0026shy;turely receding hairline looked up, startled. Dragosani jerked his thumb towards the open door. \u0027You, out! Wait outside. I\u0027ll call when I want you.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 bewildered, the man stood up. \u0027Comrade Dra\u0026shy;gosani, I must protest! I - \u0027\n Dragosani reached across the desk, grabbed the man by the left cheek of his face and dragged him bodily across the desk top, scattering pens and pencils every\u0026shy;where. Amidst a squall of muted, pained squawkings, he whirled him towards the open door and aimed a kick at his backside as he released him. \u0027Protest to Gregor Borowitz next time you see him,\u0027 he snapped. \u0027Until then obey my orders or I\u0027ll have you shot!\u0027\n He continued through into Borowitz\u0027s old office, the DO trembling as he followed on behind. Without pause Dragosani lowered himself into Borowitz\u0027s chair behind his desk, continued to glare at the DO. \u0027Now, who\u0027s watching Keogh?\u0027\n Completely overawed, the DO stuttered a little before settling down. \u0027I ... I ... we ... the GREPO,\u0027 he finally got it out. \"The Grenzpolizei, the East German Border Police.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, yes - I know who the GREPO are,\u0027 Dragosani scowled. Then he nodded. \u0027Good! They\u0027re very efficient, I\u0027m told. Right, these are my orders - on behalf of Gregor Borowitz. Keogh is to be taken, alive if possible. That was what I ordered last night, and I hate to repeat myself!\u0027\n \u0027But they had no holding charge, Comrade Dragosani,\u0027\n the DO explained. \u0027He is not listed, this Keogh, and so far he has done nothing wrong.\u0027\n \u0027The charge is ... murder,\u0027 said Dragosani. \u0027He mur\u0026shy;dered one of our agents, a sleeper, in England. Anyway, he will be taken. If that proves difficult, the orders are to shoot him! I ordered that, too, last night.\u0027\n The DO felt that he, personally, was being accused. He felt he had to make excuses: \u0027But these are Germans, Comrade,\u0027 he said. \u0027Some of them like to believe that they still govern themselves, if you see what I mean.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Dragosani, \u0027I don\u0027t. Use the telephone next door. Get me the headquarters of the Grenzpolizei in Berlin. I\u0027ll speak to them.\u0027\n The DO stood gaping at him.\n \u0027Now!\u0027 Dragosani snapped. And as the man scurried out he called after him: \u0027And send in that dolt from outside.\u0027\n When Borowitz\u0027s secretary entered Dragosani said, \u0027Sit. And listen. Until the Comrade General returns I\u0027ll be in charge. What do you know about the working of this place?\u0027\n \u0027Almost everything, Comrade Dragosani,\u0027 answered the other, still pale and frightened and holding his face. \u0027The Comrade General left many things to me.\u0027\n \u0027Manpower?\u0027\n \u0027What about it, Comrade Drag-\u0027\n \u0027Cut that out!\u0027 Dragosani snapped. \u0027No more \"Com\u0026shy;rade\", it wastes time. Simply call me Dragosani.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Dragosani.\u0027\n \u0027Manpower,\u0027 Dragosani said again. \u0027What do we have here right now?\u0027\n \u0027Here at the Chateau? Right now? A skeleton staff of ESPers, and maybe a dozen security men.\u0027\n \u0027Call-in system?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes, Dragosani.\u0027\n \u0027Good! I\u0027ll want at least enough men to make our\n numbers up to thirty. And I\u0027ll want them by 5:00 p.m. - at the very latest. I want our best telepaths and forecasters, including Igor Vlady, to be among them. Can that be done? Can we muster these men by 5:00 p.m.?\u0027\n The other immediately nodded. \u0027In more than three hours? Oh, yes, Dragosani. Definitely.\u0027\n \u0027Then get on with it.\u0027\n When he was alone Dragosani settled back in his chair and put his feet up on the desk. He thought about what he was doing. If the East Germans took Keogh, especially if they killed him (in which case Dragosani must make sure that he, personally, got hold of the body) that must surely cancel out the possibility of Keogh\u0027s being part of tonight\u0027s disturbance. Mustn\u0027t it? In any case it was difficult to see how Keogh could possibly make it here, from Leipzig, in just a few hours. So perhaps Dragosani should be concentrating on some other eventuality - but what? Sabotage? Was the cold ESP war finally starting to heat up? Had his murdering Sir Keenan Gormley lit some sort of slow fuse, laid perhaps a long time ago? But what could possibly harm the Chateau? The place was impregnable as a castle. Fifty Keoghs wouldn\u0027t even make it over the outer wall!\n Angry with himself, with the gradual build-up of ten\u0026shy;sion inside him, Dragosani forced Keogh out of his mind. No, the threat must come from somewhere else. He gave a little more thought to the Chateau\u0027s fortifications.\n Dragosani had never fully understood the need to fortify the Chateau, but now he was glad indeed for its defences. Of course, old Borowitz had been a soldier long before he had started E-Branch; he was an expert strategist, and doubtless he\u0027d had his reasons for insisting on this degree of security. But here, right next door to Moscow itself? What had he feared? Insurgency? Trouble from the KGB, perhaps? Or was it just one of the old man\u0027s hangups from his political or military feuding days?\n Not that this was the only fortified place in the USSR, far from it. The space centres, nuclear and plasma research stations, and the chemical and biological warfare labs at Berezov were all security hotspots, tight as prov\u0026shy;erbial drums.\n Dragosani scowled. How he wished he had Borowitz here now, downstairs in his operating theatre, stretched out on a steel table with his guts hanging open and all the secrets of his soul laid bare. Ah, well, and that too would come to pass - when they finally found the old bastard\u0027s body!\n \u0027Comrade Dragosani!\u0027 the DO\u0027s voice calling from next door shattered his thoughts to shards. \u0027I have GREPO HQ in Berlin for you. I\u0027m putting them through now.\u0027\n \u0027Good,\u0027 he called back. \u0027And while I\u0027m speaking to them there\u0027s something else you can do. I want the Chateau searched top to bottom. Especially the cellars. To my knowledge there are rooms down there no one ever went into. I want the place turned inside out. Look for bombs, incendiary devices, for anything at all that looks suspicious. I want as many men on it as possible -particularly the ESPers. Understood?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Comrade, of course.\u0027\n \u0027Very well, now let me speak to these damned Germans.\u0027\n It was 3:15 p.m. and Arctic cold in the city cemetery in Leipzig.\n Harry Keogh, his overcoat turned up around his ears and a flask of coffee (long empty) in his lap, sat frozen at the foot of August Ferdinand Mobius\u0027 grave and despaired. He had sought to apply his ESPer\u0027s mind -his \u0027metaphysical\u0027 talent - to the equally conjectural properties of altered space-time and four-dimensioned topology and failed. Intuition told him it was possible, that he could in fact take a Mobius trip sideways in time,\n but the mechanics of the thing were mountain-sized stumbling blocks that he just couldn\u0027t climb. His instinc\u0026shy;tive or intuitive grasp of maths and non-Euclidean geometry was not enough. He felt like a man given the equation E \u003d me2 and then asked to prove it by producing an atomic explosion - but with his mind alone! How do you go about turning unbodied numbers, pure maths into physical facts? It\u0027s not enough to know that there are ten thousand bricks in a house; you can\u0027t build the house of numbers, you need the bricks! It was one thing for Mobius to send his unbodied mind out beyond the farthest stars, but Harry Keogh was a physical three-dimensional man of living flesh and blood. And just suppose he succeeded and actually discovered how to teleport himself from \u0027A\u0027 to some hypothetical \u0027B\u0027 without physically covering the space between. What then? Where would he teleport himself to - and how would he know when he was there? It could prove as dangerous as stepping off a cliff to prove the law of gravity!\n For days now he\u0027d occupied his mind with the problem to the exclusion of almost everything else. He had taken food and drink and sleep, yes, attending to all of Nature\u0027s needs, but to nothing else. And still the problem remained unsolved, space-time refused to warp for him, the equa\u0026shy;tions remained dark unfathomed squiggles on the now grubby, well-thumbed pages of his mind. A wonderful ambition, certainly - to impose himself physically within a metaphysical frame - but how to go about it?\n \u0027You need a spur, Harry,\u0027 said Mobius, wearily break\u0026shy;ing in on his thoughts for what must be the fiftieth time in the last day or so. \u0027Personally, I think that\u0027s all that remains. After all, necessity is the mother of invention, you know. So far you know what you want to do - and I for one believe you have the knack, the intuitive ability, even though you haven\u0027t found it yet - but you haven\u0027t a good enough reason for doing it! That\u0027s all you need\n now, the right spur. The prod that will make you take the final step.\u0027\n Harry gave a mental nod of acknowledgement. \u0027You\u0027re probably right,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know I will do it; it\u0027s just that I ... haven\u0027t tried yet? It\u0027s something like giving up smoking: you can but can\u0027t. You probably will when it\u0027s too late, when you\u0027re dying of cancer. Except I don\u0027t want to wait that long! I mean, I have all the maths, all the theory - I have all the ego, really, the intuition - but I haven\u0027t the need, not yet. Or the spur, if you like. Let me tell you what it feels like:\n \u0027I\u0027m sitting in a well-lighted room with a window and a door. I look out the window and it\u0027s dark out there. It always will be. Not night but a stronger darkness that will last for ever. It\u0027s the darkness of the spaces between the spaces. I know there are other rooms out there some\u0026shy;where. My problem is that I don\u0027t have any directions. If I go out that door I\u0027ll be part of the darkness, surrounded by it. I might not be able to come in again, here or anywhere else. It\u0027s not so much that I can\u0027t go out but more that I don\u0027t want to think about what it\u0027s like out there. Actually, to know it\u0027s there is to know I can go out into it. I feel that the going will just be an extension of the other things I can do, but an untried extension. I\u0027m a chicken in a shell, and I won\u0027t break out until I have to!\u0027\n \u0027Who are you talking to, Mr Harry Keogh?\u0027 asked a voice that wasn\u0027t Mobius\u0027, a flat, cold voice, as curious as it was emotionless.\n \u0027What?\u0027 Startled, Harry looked up.\n There were two of them, and it was obvious who or what they were. Even knowing nothing about spying or East-West politics, he would have recognised these two on sight. They chilled him more than the thin wind which now began to keen through the empty cemetery, blowing dead leaves and scraps of paper along the aisles between the tombs.\n One was very tall, the other short, but their dark-grey overcoats, their hats pulled down at the front and their narrow-rimmed spectacles were so uniform in themselves as to make them appear twins. Certainly twins in their natures, in their thoughts and their petty ambitions. As plain-clothes men - policemen, probably political - they were quite unmistakable.\n \u0027What?\u0027 Harry said again, coming stiffly to his feet. \u0027Was I talking to myself again? Fm sorry about that, I do it all the time. It\u0027s just a habit of mine.\u0027\n Talking to yourself?\u0027 the tall one repeated him, and shook his head. \u0027No, I don\u0027t think so.\u0027 His accent was thick, his lips thin as his mirthless smile. \u0027I think you were talking to someone else - probably to another spy, Harry Keogh!\u0027\n Harry backed away from them a pace or two. \u0027I really don\u0027t know what -\u0027 he began.\n \u0027Where is your radio, Mr Keogh?\u0027 said the short one. He came forward, kicked at the dirt of the grave where Harry had been sitting. \u0027Is it here, buried in the soil, perhaps? Day after day, sitting here, talking to yourself? You must think we\u0027re all fools!\u0027\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 Harry croaked, still backing away. \u0027You must have the wrong man. Spy? That\u0027s crazy. I\u0027m a tourist, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 said the tall one. \u0027A tourist? In the middle of winter? A tourist who comes and sits in the same grave\u0026shy;yard day after day, to talk to himself? You can do better than that, Mr Keogh. And so can we. We have it on good authority that you are a British agent, also that you\u0027re a murderer. So now, please, you will come with us.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t go with them, Harry!\u0027 it was Keenan Gormley\u0027s voice, coming from nowhere, unbidden to Harry\u0027s mind. \u0027Run, man, run!\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 Harry gasped. \u0027Keenan? But how...?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, Harry! My Harry!\u0027 cried his mother. \u0027Please be careful!\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 he said again, shaking his head, still backing away from the two men.\n The small one produced handcuffs, said: \u0027I must warn you, Mr Keogh, against resistance. We are counter\u0026shy;espionage officials of the Grenzpolizei, and -\u0027\n \u0027Hit him, Harry!\u0027 urged Graham \u0027Sergeant\u0027 Lane in Harry\u0027s innermost ear. \u0027You have the measure of both these lads. You know the way. Do it to them before they do it to you. But watch it - they\u0027re armed!\u0027\n As the short one took three quick paces forward, holding out the handcuffs, Harry adopted a defensive stance. Also closing in, the tall one yelled: \u0027What\u0027s this? You threaten violence? You should know, Harry Keogh, that our orders are to take you dead or alive!\u0027\n The short one made to snap the cuffs on Harry\u0027s wrists. At the last moment Harry slapped them aside, half-turned, lashed out with his heel at the end of a leg stiffened into a bar of solid bone. The blow took the short one in the chest, snapped ribs, drove him backwards into his tall colleague. Screaming his agony, he slipped to the ground.\n \u0027You can\u0027t win, Harry!\u0027 Gormley insisted. \u0027Not like this.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s right,\u0027 said James Gordon Hannant. \u0027This is your last chance, Harry, and you have to take it. Even if you stop these two there\u0027ll be others. This isn\u0027t the way. You have to use your talent, Harry. Your talent is bigger than you suspect. I didn\u0027t teach you anything about maths - I only showed you how to use what was in you. But your full potential remains untapped. Man, you have formulae I haven\u0027t even dreamed of! You yourself once said some\u0026shy;thing like that to my son, remember?\u0027\n Harry remembered.\n Strange equations suddenly flashed on the screen of his\n mind. Doors opened where no doors should be. His metaphysical mind reached out and grasped the physical world, eager to bend it to his will. He could hear the felled plain-clothes man screaming his rage and pain, could see the taller one reaching into his overcoat and drawing out an ugly, short-barrelled weapon. But printed over this picture of the real world, the doors in the Mobius space-time dimension were there within reach, their dark thresholds seeming to beckon.\n \u0027That\u0027s it, Harry!\u0027 cried Mobius himself. \u0027Any one of them will do!\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know where they go!\u0027 he yelled out loud.\n \u0027Good luck, Harry!\u0027 shouted Gormley, Hannant and Lane, almost in unison.\n The gun in the tall agent\u0027s hand spouted fire and lead. Harry twisted, felt a hot breath against his neck as something snatched angrily at the collar of his coat. He whirled, leaped, drop-kicked the tall man and felt deep satisfaction as his feet crashed into face and shoulder. The man went down, his weapon clattering to the hard ground. Cursing and spitting blood and teeth, he scrambled after it, grasped it in two hands, came up into a stumbling crouch.\n Out of the corner of his eye, Harry spied a door in the Mobius strip. It was so close that if he reached out his hand he could touch it. The tall agent snarled something incomprehensible, swung his gun in Harry\u0027s direction. Harry knocked it aside, grabbed the man\u0027s sleeve, tugged him off balance and swung him -\n - Through the open door.\n The German agent was ... no longer there! From nowhere, an awful, lingering, slowly fading scream came echoing back. It was the cry of the damned, of a soul lost for ever in ultimate darkness.\n Harry listened to that cry and shuddered - but only for a moment. Over and above it as it dwindled, he heard\n shouted instructions, the crunch of running feet on gravel. Men were coming, dodging between the tombstones, converging on him. He knew that if he was going to use the doors, it had to be now. The injured agent on the ground was holding a gun in hands that trembled like jelly. His eyes were impossibly round for he had seen... something! He was no longer sure if he dared pull the trigger and shoot at this man.\n Harry didn\u0027t give him time to think it over. Kicking his gun away, he paused for one last split-second and let the screens in his mind display once more their fantastic formulae. The running men were closer; a bullet whined where it struck sparks from marble.\n Printed over Mobius\u0027 headstone, a door floated out of nowhere. That was appropriate, Harry thought - and he made a headlong dive.\n On the cold earth, the crippled East German agent watched him go, disappearing into the stone!\n Panting men came together in a knot, skidding to a halt. All held guns extended forward, ready. They stared about, searched with keen, cold eyes. The crippled agent pointed. He lay there with his broken ribs and drained white face and pointed a trembling finger at Mobius\u0027 headstone. But for the moment, stunned to his roots, he said nothing at all.\n The keening wind continued to blow.\n By 4:45 p.m. Dragosani knew the worst of it. Harry Keogh was alive; he had not been taken but had somehow contrived to make his escape; what means he had employed in that escape were unknown, or at best the accounts were garbled and not to be trusted. But one agent was missing believed dead and another seriously injured, and now the East Germans were making angry noises and demanding to know just who or what they were dealing with. Well, let them demand what they\n would - Dragosani only wished he knew what he was dealing with!\n Anyway, the problem was his now and time was pres\u0026shy;sing. For there could no longer be any doubt but that Keogh was coming here, and coming tonight? How? Who could say? When, exactly? That, too, remained impossible to gauge. But of one thing Dragosani was absolutely certain: come he would. One man, hurling himself against a small army! His task was impossible, of course - but Dragosani knew of the existence of many things which ordinary men considered impossible...\n Meanwhile, the Chateau\u0027s emergency call-in system had worked well. Dragosani had all the men he had asked for and half-a-dozen more. They manned machine-gun posts on the outer walls, similar batteries in the outbuildings, also the fortified pill-boxes built into the buttresses of the Chateau itself. ESPers \u0027worked\u0027 down below in the laboratories, in surroundings best suited to their various abilities and talents, and Dragosani had turned Borowitz\u0027s offices into his tactical HQ.\n The Chateau had been searched, as per his orders, top to bottom; but as soon as he had learned of Keogh\u0027s escape he had called a halt to that; he had known where the trouble must originate. By then the lower vaults of the place had been explored to the full, floorboards and centuried flagstones had been ripped up in the older buildings, the foundations of the place had been laid bare almost down to the earth itself. Three dozen men can do a lot of damage in three hours, particularly when they\u0027ve been told that their lives may well depend upon it.\n But what enraged Dragosani most of all was the thought that all of this was on account of just one man, Harry Keogh, and that utter chaos had been forecast in his name. Which meant quite simply that Keogh wielded an awesome power of destruction. But what was it? Drago\u0026shy;sani knew he was a necroscope - so what? Also, he had\n seen a dead thing rise up from a river and come to his aid. But that had been his mother and the location had been Scotland, thousands of miles away. There was no one here to fight Keogh\u0027s battles for him.\n Of course, if Dragosani was so worried by all of this he could always flee the place (the trouble was scheduled for the Chateau Bronnitsy and nowhere else), but that just wouldn\u0027t be in his own interest. Not only would it smack of utter cowardice, it wouldn\u0027t fulfill Igor Vlady\u0027s prediction - his prediction that the vampire in Dragosani would die this night. And that was one prediction Boris Dragosani desired fulfilled above all others. Indeed it was his ambition, while his mind was still his own to crave for it!\n As for Vlady himself - the call-in squad had found a note at his place which explained his absence, a note intended for his fianc��e. Vlady would call for her soon, the note said, from the West. Dragosani had been delighted to put out the traitor\u0027s description to all relevant points of egress. Nor had he given him any quarter: he was to be shot on sight, in the name of the security of the mighty USSR.\n So much for Vlady, and yet ... would he have fared any better here? Dragosani wondered about that. Had he, Dragosani, terrified Vlady that much, or had it been something else he\u0027d fled from?\n Something he\u0027d seen approaching, perhaps, out of the very near future. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-necroscope-1/page-16.html","bookId":2436,"book":{"id":2436,"title":"Necroscope (Necroscope #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry is an English youth in school, and strange things occur as he grows up, such as a sudden increased intellect in mathematics, and the ability to fight beyond his experience after a teacher is killed.
