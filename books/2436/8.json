{"id":78771,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Harry Keogh was miles away, his thoughts lost in the clouds that drifted like puffs of cotton wool on the blue ocean of a summer sky. Hands behind his head, a blade of sweet grass standing straight up like a tiny mast, its white tip trapped in his teeth, he hadn\u0027t said a word since they\u0027d made love. Seagulls cried where they made white splashes in the shallows, diving for fish, and their somehow plaintive songs came up off the sea on a breeze that moved the grass on the dunes like a caress.\\n\\n A caress, too, Brenda\u0027s hand where she stroked him, even though she no longer commanded the full attention of his flesh. In a little while he might want her again, but if not it wouldn\u0027t matter. In fact she liked him like this: quiet, verging on sleep, with all of his strangeness sucked out of him. He was strange, yes, but that was all part of his fascination. It was one of the reasons she loved him. And sometimes she fancied that he loved her, too. It was difficult to tell, with Harry. Most things were difficult to tell with him.\\n\\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 she said, gently tickling his ribs. \u0027Anybody in?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Umm?\u0027 the grass in his teeth gave a feeble twitch. She knew he wasn\u0027t ignoring her, knew that he simply wasn\u0027t here. Not here at all - not all of him - but somewhere else, somewhere very different. Now and then she would try to find out about that place, Harry\u0027s secret place, but so far he\u0027d kept mum.\\n\\n She sat up, buttoned her blouse, straightened her skirt, brushed sand from its pleats. \u0027Harry, you should do yourself up. There are people down on the beach. If they walked this way they\u0027d see.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Umm,\u0027 he said again.\\n\\n She did it for him, then curled beside him and kissed his forehead. Tugging his ear, she asked: \u0027What are you thinking? Where are you, Harry?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t want to know that,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s not always a nice place. I\u0027m used to it, but you wouldn\u0027t like it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d like it if you were there,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n He turned his face towards her, squinted a little, frowned seriously. He could look very serious, she thought, sometimes - in fact most of the time. Now he shook his head. \u0027No, you wouldn\u0027t like it if I was there,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027d hate it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not if I were with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not a place where you can be with someone,\u0027 he told her, which was as close to the truth as he had ever come on this subject. \u0027It\u0027s a place for being entirely alone.\u0027\\n\\n She wanted to know more. \u0027Harry, I - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, we\u0027re here,\u0027 he cut her off. \u0027Nowhere else. We\u0027re here and we\u0027ve just made love.\u0027\\n\\n Knowing that if she tried to probe deeper he would only retreat, she changed the subject. \u0027You\u0027ve made love to me,\u0027 she said, \u0027eight hundred and eleven times.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I used to do that,\u0027 he said, presently.\\n\\n It stopped her dead in her tracks. After a moment\u0027s thought, she said: \u0027Do what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Count things. Anything. Tiles on a toilet wall. You know, while I was sitting there.\u0027\\n\\n She sighed, exasperated. \u0027I was talking about making love, Harry! Sometimes I think there isn\u0027t an ounce of romance in you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There isn\u0027t now,\u0027 he agreed. \u0027You just had it all!\u0027 That was better. He was away from his morbid turn. That was how Brenda thought of it when Harry was vague and strange in that way of his: \u0027a morbid turn\u0027. She went along with it, wrinkled her nose playfully, was glad for his humour.\\n\\n \u0027Eight hundred and eleven times\u0027 she repeated, \u0027in just three years! That\u0027s a lot. Do you know how long we\u0027ve been going out?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Since we were kids,\u0027 he answered. His eyes were on the sky again and she could see he was only half interested in what she was saying. There was something on his mind, hovering on the periphery of his awareness. Knowing him, she knew it was there. Maybe one day she\u0027d know what it was. All she knew now was that it came and went, and that this time it seemed to be taking its time going.\\n\\n \u0027But how long?\u0027 she insisted. She caught his chin in a delicate hand, turned his face towards hers.\\n\\n He stared at her blankly, let his eyes focus of their own accord. \u0027How long? Four or five years, I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Six,\u0027 she said. \u0027Since you were twelve and I was eleven. At twelve you took me to the pictures and held my hand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There you go,\u0027 he said, making an effort and coming back to earth. \u0027And you just accused me of being unromantic!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 she said. \u0027But I bet you can\u0027t remember the film we saw. It was Psycho. I don\u0027t know which of us was the most frightened!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was,\u0027 he grinned.\\n\\n \u0027Then,\u0027 she continued, \u0027when you were thirteen, we made a picnic in the field on Ellison\u0027s Bank. After we had eaten we fooled about a bit and you put your hand on my leg under my dress. I shouted at you and you pretended it was an accident. But the next week you did it again and I wouldn\u0027t speak to you for a fortnight.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I should be so unlucky now!\u0027 Harry sighed. \u0027Anyway, you soon enough came back for more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then you started going to school in Hartlepool and I didn\u0027t see so much of you. The winter was a long one. But the next summer was a good one - for us, anyway. One day we got a changing tent on the beach at Crimdon and went swimming. Afterwards, in the tent, when you were supposed to be drying my back, you touched me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you touched me,\u0027 he reminded her.\\n\\n \u0027And you wanted me to lie down with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you wouldn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not until the next year. Harry, I wasn\u0027t even fifteen! That was terrible!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, it wasn\u0027t so bad,\u0027 he grinned. \u0027Not the way I remember it. But do you remember that first time?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course I do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What a mess!\u0027 he chuckled ruefully. \u0027Like trying to pick a lock with a piece of wet blotting paper.\u0027\\n\\n She had to smile. \u0027You got good at it very quickly, though,\u0027 she said. \u0027I always wondered where you learned it all. I suppose I really wondered if someone else had shown you how.\u0027\\n\\n He had been smiling but now the smile fell from his face in a moment. \u0027What do you mean by that?\u0027 he said sharply.\\n\\n \u0027Why, another girl, of course!\u0027 She was startled by his abrupt change of mood. \u0027What did you think I meant?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Another girl?\u0027 he was frowning still. But slowly his look turned first to a sour smile, then an amused grin, and at the last a shaky laugh. \u0027Another girl!\u0027 he said again, laughing outright now. \u0027What, when I was eleven?\u0027\\n\\n Relieved, Brenda laughed with him. \u0027You\u0027re funny,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027You know,\u0027 he answered, \u0027it seems that all my life people have been telling me the same thing: that I\u0027m funny. I\u0027m not really, you know. God, sometimes I wish I knew how to be: how to have a good laugh! It\u0027s as if I don\u0027t have time, as if I\u0027ve never had time. Did you ever get the feeling that if you don\u0027t laugh soon you\u0027ll scream? It\u0027s a feeling I get, I promise you.\u0027\\n\\n She shook her head. \u0027Sometimes I think I\u0027ll never understand you. And sometimes I think you don\u0027t want me to.\u0027 She sighed. \u0027It would be nice if you wanted me as much as I want you.\u0027\\n\\n He stood up, drew her to her feet and kissed her on the forehead, his way of changing the subject. \u0027Come on, let\u0027s walk all the way along the beach into Hartlepool. You can catch a bus back to Harden from there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Walk into Hartlepool? That\u0027ll take all day!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll stop for a coffee on the beach at Crimdon,\u0027 he said. \u0027And we can have a swim from the sands a bit farther along. Then we\u0027ll go to my place. You can stay until this evening if you like - unless you\u0027ve other plans?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I haven\u0027t - you know I haven\u0027t - but...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But?\u0027\\n\\n Suddenly she was upset, a touch of anxiety. \u0027Harry, what\u0027s going to happen to us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you love me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But don\u0027t you know? I mean, I know I love you.\u0027\\n\\n They began to walk along the dunes, gradually making for the damp sands where the sea was retreating. There were people swimming in the sea down there but not many; the beach was dirty with all the debris of the coalmines to the north, a problem which had been growing for a quarter of a century. Black lorries trundled at the waterline like great amphibious beetles, where their crews shovelled up rounded nuggets of washed sea-coal like black gold. A few miles south of here it was a little cleaner, but as far as Seaton Carew coal and slag deposits marred the clean white sands. Farther south still the damage was much less, but since the mines were almost exhausted Nature would soon begin to put things right again. Still, it would take a long time for the beaches to return to their former beauty. Perhaps they never would.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Harry finally answered, \u0027I think I do love you. I mean, I know I do. It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve a lot on my mind. Is that what you mean? That I don\u0027t show it enough? See, I don\u0027t know what you want me to say. Or I haven\u0027t the time to think of the right things to say.\u0027\\n\\n She clung to his arm, snuggled closer as they walked. \u0027Oh, you don\u0027t have to say anything. It\u0027s just that I\u0027d hate it to end...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why should it end?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, but I worry about it. We don\u0027t seem to be getting anywhere. My parents worry, too...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 he said, glumly nodding. \u0027Marriage, you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not really,\u0027 she sighed again. \u0027I know how you feel about that: not yet, you keep saying. And: we\u0027re too young. I agree with you. I think my mother and father do, too. I know you like to be on your own a lot; and you\u0027re right: we are too young!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You keep saying that,\u0027 he said, \u0027but still we end up going round in circles.\u0027\\n\\n She looked downcast. \u0027It\u0027s just that... well, the way you are, I never know what\u0027s what. If only you\u0027d tell me what it is that preoccupies you so. I know there\u0027s something, but you won\u0027t say.\u0027\\n\\n He looked about to say something, changed his mind. Brenda held her breath, let it go when it became apparent he\u0027d backed off. She tried elimination.\\n\\n \u0027I know it\u0027s not your writing, because you were like this long before you started to write. In fact, as long as I\u0027ve known you. If only - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Brenda!\u0027 he stopped, grabbed her in his arms, dragged\\n\\n her to a halt. He seemed breathless, unable to speak, to say what he wanted to say. It frightened her.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Harry? What is it?\u0027\\n\\n He gulped, drew breath, started to walk again. She caught up with him, grabbed his hand. \u0027Harry?\u0027\\n\\n He wouldn\u0027t look at her, but he said:\\n\\n \u0027Brenda, I... I want to talk to you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I want you to!\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Again he stopped walking, drew her into an embrace, stared out to sea over her shoulder. \u0027It\u0027s a queer subject, that\u0027s all...\u0027\\n\\n She took the initiative, broke away, led him by the hand along the beach. \u0027Right. We walk, you talk, I listen. Queer subject? I don\u0027t mind. There, I\u0027ve done my bit. Your turn.\u0027\\n\\n He nodded, glanced at her out of the corner of his eye, coughed to clear his throat and said: \u0027Brenda, have you ever wondered what people think about when they\u0027re dead? I mean, what their thoughts are when they lie there in their graves.\u0027\\n\\n She felt goose-flesh come up on her neck and at the top of her spine. Even with the sun hot on her, the utterly emotionless tone of his voice coupled with what he had said chilled her to the marrow. \u0027Have I ever wondered - ?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said it was a queer subject,\u0027 he hurriedly reminded her.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t know what to say to him, how to answer him. She gave an involuntary shudder. He couldn\u0027t be serious, could he? Or was this something he was working on? That must be it: it was a story he was writing!\\n\\n Brenda was disappointed. A story, that\u0027s all. On the other hand, perhaps she had been wrong to neglect his writing as the source of his moodiness. Maybe he was that way because there was no one to talk to. Everyone knew that he was precocious; his writing was brilliant, the work of a mature man. Was that it? Was it simply that he had too much bottled up inside, and no way to let it out?\\n\\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 she said, \u0027you should have told me it was your writing!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My writing?\u0027 his eyebrows went up.\\n\\n \u0027A story,\u0027 she said. That\u0027s what it is, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n He began to shake his head, then changed it to a nod. And smiling, he nodded more rapidly. \u0027You guessed it,\u0027 he said. \u0027A story. But a weird one. I\u0027m having difficulty pulling it together. If I could talk about it - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you can, to me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So let\u0027s talk. It might give me some more ideas, or tell me what\u0027s wrong with the ideas I\u0027ve got now.\u0027\\n\\n They carried on walking, hand in hand. \u0027Right,\u0027 she said, and after frowning for a moment, \u0027happy thoughts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The dead, in their graves. I think they\u0027d think happy thoughts. That would be the equivalent of heaven, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027People who were unhappy in their lives don\u0027t think anything,\u0027 he told her, matter-of-factly. \u0027They\u0027re just glad to be out of it, mostly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah! You mean that you\u0027re going to have categories of dead people: they won\u0027t be all the same or think the same thoughts.\u0027\\n\\n He nodded. \u0027That\u0027s right. Why should they? They didn\u0027t think the same thoughts when they were alive, did they? Oh, some of them are happy, with nothing to complain of. But there are others who lie there sick with hatred, because they know the ones who killed them live on, unpunished.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Harry, that\u0027s an awful idea! What sort of story is it, anyway? It has to be a ghost story.\u0027\\n\\n He licked his lips, nodded again. \u0027Something like that, yes. It\u0027s about a man who can talk to people in their graves. He can hear them, in his head, and know what they\u0027re thinking. Yes, and he can talk to them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I still think it\u0027s terrible,\u0027 she said. \u0027I mean, it\u0027s horrible! But the idea is good. And these dead people actually talk to him? But why would they want to?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because they\u0027re lonely. See, there\u0027s no one else like this man. As far as he knows, he\u0027s the only one who can do it. They don\u0027t have anyone else to talk to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wouldn\u0027t that drive him mad? I mean, all those voices in his head at the same time, all yammering for his attention?\u0027\\n\\n Harry gave a wry smile. \u0027It doesn\u0027t happen like that,\u0027 he said. \u0027See, normally they just lie there, thinking. The body goes - I mean, you know, it rots - eventually becomes dust. But the mind goes on. Don\u0027t ask me how, that\u0027s something I won\u0027t try to explain. It\u0027s simply that the mind is the conscious and the subconscious control centre of a person, and after he dies it carries on - but only on the subconscious level. Like he\u0027s sleeping; and in fact he is sleeping, in a way. It\u0027s just that he won\u0027t wake up again. So you see, the necroscope only talks to the people he wants to talk to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Necroscope?\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s my name for such a person. A man who looks into the minds of the dead...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Brenda, frowning. \u0027At least, I think I do. So happy people just lie there remembering all the good things, or thinking happy thoughts. And unhappy people, they just switch off?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Something like that. Malicious people think bad things, and murderers think murderous thoughts, and so on: their own particular sorts of hell, if you like. But these are the ordinary people, with ordinary thoughts. I mean, their thoughts run on a low level. Let\u0027s say that in life their thoughts were pretty mundane. I\u0027m not putting them down; they just weren\u0027t very bright, that\u0027s all. But there are extraordinary people, too: creative people, great thinkers, architects, mathematicians, authors, the real intellectuals. And what do you suppose they do?\u0027\\n\\n Brenda looked at him, trying to gauge his thoughts. She paused to pick up a bright, sea-washed pebble. And in a little while: \u0027I suppose they\u0027d go on doing their thing,\u0027 she said. \u0027If they were, say, great thinkers in their lives, then they\u0027d just go on sort of thinking their special thoughts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right!\u0027 said Harry emphatically. \u0027That\u0027s exactly what they do. The bridge-builders go on building their bridges - in their heads. Beautiful, airy things that span entire oceans! The musicians write wonderful songs and melodies. The mathematicians develop abstract theories and polish them until they are crystal things even a child could understand, and yet so astonishing that they hold the secrets of the universe. They improve upon what they were doing when they were alive. They carry their ideas to the limits of perfection, finishing all the unfinished thoughts they never had time for when they lived. And no distractions, no outside interference, no one to bother or confuse or concern them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The way you tell it,\u0027 she said, \u0027it sounds nice. But do you think that\u0027s how it really is?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 he nodded, and quickly checked himself. \u0027In my story, anyway. I mean, how would I know what it\u0027s really like?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was just being silly,\u0027 she told him. \u0027Of course it\u0027s not really like that. Anyway, I still don\u0027t see why these dead people would want to talk to your, er, necroscope. Wouldn\u0027t he be a distraction? Wouldn\u0027t he annoy them, butting in like that on all their great schemes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Harry shook his head. \u0027On the contrary. It\u0027s human nature, see? What\u0027s the good of doing something wonderful if you can\u0027t tell or show anyone what you\u0027ve done? That\u0027s why they enjoy talking to the necroscope. He can appreciate their genius. He\u0027s the only one who can do that! Also, he\u0027s sympathetic - he wants to know about their wonderful discoveries, the fantastic inventions they\u0027ve designed, which won\u0027t be invented in the real world for a thousand years!\u0027\\n\\n Brenda suddenly saw something in what he\u0027d said. \u0027But that\u0027s a wonderful idea, Harry! It\u0027s not morbid at all, as I first thought. Why, the necroscope could \"invent\" their inventions for them! He could build their bridges, make their music, write their unwritten masterpieces! Is that what\u0027s going to happen? In your story, I mean?\u0027\\n\\n He turned his face away, stood gazing far out to sea, and said: \u0027Something like that, I suppose. That\u0027s what I haven\u0027t worked out yet...\u0027\\n\\n Then for a while they were silent, and shortly afterwards they came to Crimdon and stopped for a coffee in a little cafe at the foot of the beach banks.\\n\\n Harry lay sleeping on his bed, stark naked, the sheets thrown back. It was a very warm evening and the sun, sinking, continued to stream its golden fire in through the high windows of his tiny flat. Seeing the fine sheen of sweat where it made his brow damp, Brenda drew the thin curtains across the garret windows to cut down on the sunlight. As the shadow fell across his face he groaned and mumbled something, but Brenda couldn\u0027t catch what he said. Quietly dressing, she thought back on the day. She thought back to other times, too, allowing her memory full rein as she examined the years she and Harry had known each other. Today had been good. And at last Harry had talked to her about... well, about things. He\u0027d opened up a little and got some of it off his chest and out of his system. And since their long talk about his story he\u0027d been a lot easier in himself, happy almost. Just what it would take to make him truly happy - Brenda could hardly imagine the nature of such a thing. He said it was that he had \u0027a lot on his mind\u0027. A lot of what? His writing? Possibly. But she had never known him to be truly happy. Or if he had been it hadn\u0027t shown much...\\n\\n But there, she\u0027d side-tracked herself. She went back to today.\\n\\n After Crimdon they\u0027d walked on for another mile to a more or less deserted part of the beach where they\u0027d gone swimming in their underwear. From a distance no one would be able to tell; it would be thought they wore costumes. After a little while, as they fooled about in the water, some old beach-combing tramp had come on the scene and it had been time to go. Dressing before the old boy could get really close, they\u0027d dried out as they covered the last leg of their walk. In Hartlepool, a bus ride from the old part of the town to the \u0027new\u0027 had carried them almost to the door of the three-storey Victorian house where Harry had his garret flat, and there Brenda had made sandwiches for them before they\u0027d showered and made love. The sex they\u0027d shared had been delicious, with both of them still tasting a little of the sea\u0027s salt, all glowing from the sun and radiating their heat, and all seeming very right and natural. She liked Harry best in the summer, for then he wasn\u0027t so pale and his thin frame seemed somehow more muscular.\\n\\n Not that he was in any way weak or weedy; Harry was well able to look after himself and hardly the type to accept sand kicked in his face. Twice Brenda had seen him deal with would-be bullies, and they had been the ones to go away nursing cuts and bruises. She secretly prided herself that on both occasions she had been the spur to his anger. Harry was indifferent towards jibes aimed at himself - he could always ignore them, put them down to the ignorance of louts-but he would not accept insults or insinuations directed at Brenda, or at himself when she was with him. At times like that he seemed almost to become another person, a harder, faster, more capable person entirely. And yet even his mastery of self-defence mystified her; it was just another of those things in which he had grown inexplicably expert. Like his lovemaking, and his writing. Brenda looked at them in that order:\\n\\n Harry had been sixteen when he first made love to her when they first did it properly, anyway - but he\u0027d been eager for it long before that. And as she had pointed out on the beach, he had very quickly got to be very good at it. Innocent in all such things, Brenda had thought there was only one way to do it, but Harry\u0027s sexual repertoire had seemed inexhaustible. And it was perfectly true: she had often wondered if someone else had shown him how.\\n\\n In the end she\u0027d stopped worrying about it, putting it down to the fact that he was precocious. For some unexplained reason there were skills in which Harry Keogh excelled - in which he excelled naturally, without any prior knowledge or intensive instruction. His writing:\\n\\n Harry had once admitted that his English had used to let him down badly; it had very nearly stopped him going on to the Tech. to complete his schooling, when he\u0027d completely messed up the English examination paper.\\n\\n Well, however much that had been the case then, it certainly wasn\u0027t so now. Perhaps it was that he\u0027d worked hard at it, but when? Brenda had never seen him studying or swotting-up his English; he had never seemed to study I anything much. And yet here he was, eighteen years old and an author, and so prolific that he was published under four pseudonyms! Only short stories so far, but three a week at least - and all of them snapped up - and she knew that he was now working on a novel.\\n\\n His battered, second-hand typewriter stood on a small table close to the window. Once when she\u0027d dropped in to see him unexpectedly, Harry had been working. It was one of the few occasions when Brenda had actually seen him at work. Coming upstairs, she had heard the intermittent clatter of the keys of his machine, and creeping into his tiny entrance hall she\u0027d poked her head round the door. Lost in thought, smiling to himself -even muttering to himself, she\u0027d fancied - Harry\u0027s chin had been propped in his hands where he sat at the table. Then he had straightened up to tap out a few more two-fingered lines, only pausing to nod and smile at some private thought, and gaze out of the garret window and across the road.\\n\\n Then she had knocked on the door, startling him, and entered the room; Harry had greeted her, put away his work and that had been that - except that she had glanced at the sheet of paper in the typewriter and had seen typed at its head: Diary of a Seventeenth-Century Rake.\\n\\n It was only later that she\u0027d wondered what Harry could possibly know about the seventeenth century (what, Harry? with his limited knowledge of history, which as it happened had always been his very worst subject?) or, for that matter, rakes...\\n\\n She was all done with dressing now and tip-toed across the room to apply a little make-up to her face in front of a wall mirror. This took her close to his table, and again she glanced at the typewriter and the uncompleted sheet it contained. Obviously he was still hard at his novel: the A4 sheet was numbered P.213 and in the left-hand upper corner bore the legend Diary of... etc.\\n\\n Brenda wound the sheet up a little and read what written - or at least started to. Then, blushing, she averted her eyes, stared out the window. It was hot stuff: very polished, very stylish, extremely randy! Out of the corner of her eye she glanced at the sheet again. She loved seventeenth-century romances and Harry\u0027s style was perfect - but this wasn\u0027t a romance and his material was frankly pornographic.\\n\\n Only then did she notice what she was looking at through the window: the old cemetery across the road. The graveyard, four hundred years old, with its great horse-chestnuts, glossy shrubbery and flower borders, its leaning, weathered headstones and generally well-tended pebble plots. And as she gazed, so she wondered at Harry\u0027s choice of a dwelling-place. There were better flats around, all over town, but he had told her that he liked the view\u0027. And it was only now that she\u0027d realised what the view was. Oh, pretty enough in the summer, certainly, but a graveyard for all that!\\n\\n Behind her Harry once again mouthed something and turned on his side. She crossed to where he lay and smiled gently down on him, then drew a sheet over his lower half. In the shade now, he was starting to shiver a little. In any case, she would soon have to wake him; it was time she got on her way. Her parents liked her to be in while it was still daylight, on those occasions when they didn\u0027t know where she was. But first she would make some coffee. As she began to turn away Harry spoke yet again, and this time his words were very clear:\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry, Ma. I\u0027m a big boy now. I can take care of myself. You can rest easy...\u0027 He paused and even sleeping seemed to adopt an attitude of listening. Then:\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027ve told you before, Ma - he didn\u0027t hurt me. Why should he? Anyway, I went to Auntie and Uncle. They looked after me. Now I\u0027m grown up. And very soon now, maybe when you know I\u0027m okay, then you\u0027ll be able to rest easy...\u0027\\n\\n Another pause, a brief period of listening, and: \u0027But why can\u0027t you, Ma?\u0027\\n\\n Then more incoherent mumbling before \u0027... I can\u0027t! Too far away. I know you\u0027re trying to tell me something but... just a whisper, Ma. I hear some of it but... don\u0027tknow what... make out what you\u0027re saying. Maybe if I come to see you, come to where you are...\u0027 Harry was restless now and sweating profusely for all that he shivered. Looking at him, Brenda became a little worried. Was it some kind of fever? Sweat gathered in the hollow above the middle of his upper lip; it formed droplets on his forehead and made his hair damp; his hands jerked and twitched beneath the sheet. She reached out a hand and touched him. \u0027Harry?\u0027 \u0027What! he burst awake, his eyes snapping open and staring fixedly, his entire body going rigid as an iron bar. \u0027Who...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Harry, Harry! It\u0027s only me. You were nightmaring.\u0027 Brenda cradled him in her arms and he let her, curling up and throwing his arms about her. \u0027It was about your Mam, Harry. Listen, you\u0027re all right now. Let me go and make some coffee.\u0027\\n\\n She hugged him tighter for a moment, then gently released herself and stood up. His eyes, still wide open, followed her as she moved to the alcove where he had his rudimentary kitchen. \u0027About my mother?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Spooning instant coffee into mugs, she nodded. She filled the electric kettle and switched it on. \u0027You called her \"Ma\", and you were talking to her.\u0027\\n\\n He uncurled himself and sat up, brushing his fingers dazedly through his hair. \u0027What did I say?\u0027\\n\\n She shook her head. \u0027Nothing much. Mainly mumbo-jumbo. You told her you were grown up now, and that she should rest easy. It was just a nightmare, Harry.\u0027\\n\\n By the time the coffee was ready he had dressed himself. They said no more about his nightmare but drank their coffees; then he walked her down to the bus-stop for Harden, where they waited in silence until the bus came. At the last, before she boarded, he kissed her lightly on the cheek. \u0027See you soon\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Tomorrow?\u0027 Tomorrow was Sunday.\\n\\n \u0027No, during the week. I\u0027ll come up for you. \u0027Bye, love.\u0027\\n\\n She got a seat at the back of the bus and watched Harry through the rear window where he stood alone at the stop. As the bus began to round a bend he turned on his heel and walked along the pavement away from his flat. Wondering where he was headed, Brenda kept watching him as long as she could. The last she saw of him was when he turned in through the gates of the cemetery, with the sun\u0027s last rays burning in his hair.\\n\\n Then the bus was round the bend and Harry was out of sight.\\n\\n Harry did not come to see her during the week, and Brenda\u0027s work began to suffer at the ladies\u0027 hairdressing salon in Harden. By Thursday she was thoroughly worried about him; on Friday night she cried and her father said she was a fool for him. \u0027That lad\u0027s bloody weird!\u0027 he declared. \u0027Our Brenda, you must be soft!\u0027 And he wouldn\u0027t hear of her going down to Hartlepool that night. \u0027Not on a Friday night, my girl, when all the lads have their beer money. You can go and see your daft Harry tomorrow!\u0027\\n\\n Tomorrow seemed ages coming and Brenda hardly slept at all, but Saturday morning bright and early she took a bus in to town and went up to Harry\u0027s flat. She had her own key and let herself in but he wasn\u0027t to be found. In the typewriter was a sheet of paper with yesterday\u0027s date and a simple message:\\n\\n Brenda -\\n\\n I\u0027ve gone up to Edinburgh for the weekend. I\u0027ve people to see up there. I\u0027ll be back Monday at the latest and I\u0027ll see you then - promise. Sorry I didn\u0027t see you during the week -I had a lot on my mind and wouldn\u0027t have been much fun.\\n\\n Love, Harry\\n\\n The last two words meant a lot to her and so she forgave him the rest. Anyway, Monday wasn\u0027t so very far away - but who could he possibly have to see in Edinburgh? He had a step-father up there, who hadn\u0027t once seen him since he was a child, but who else? No one that Brenda knew of. Other relatives that she didn\u0027t know of? Maybe. And then there had been his mother, except she had been drowned when he was little more than a baby.\\n\\n Drowned, yes, but Harry had been talking to her in his sleep...\\n\\n Brenda shook herself. Why, some of her ideas were almost as morbid as Harry\u0027s! All graveyards and death and maggots. No, of course he wouldn\u0027t be going to see his mother, for they\u0027d never found her body. There would be no grave for him to visit.\\n\\n The thought didn\u0027t improve Brenda\u0027s state of mind. Instead it drove her to do something she would never normally consider. She carefully went through Harry\u0027s file of manuscripts, checking every story whether it was complete or barely started. She didn\u0027t really know what she was looking for, but by the\\n\\n time she was through she knew what she had failed to find.\\n\\n Nowhere in all his work had she come across a story about a necroscope.\\n\\n So, either Harry hadn\u0027t started the story yet -\\n\\n Or he was a liar -\\n\\n Or -\\n\\n Or what was bothering her was something entirely different.\\n\\n As Brenda Cowell stood in a shaft of morning sunlight in Harry\u0027s flat, pondering the strangeness of the man she was involved with, one hundred and twenty miles away Harry Keogh himself stood in the same sunlight on the banks of a drowsy river in Scotland and looked across it at the big house where it stood at the head of a large, overgrown garden. There had been a time when the place was well maintained, but that was a long time ago and Harry couldn\u0027t remember it. He had been too young, an infant, and there were many things he couldn\u0027t remember. But he remembered his mother. Somewhere, deep in his subconscious mind, he had never forgotten about her -and she had never forgotten about him. And she still worried about him.\\n\\n Harry stared at the house for a long time, then at the river. Its waters moved slowly, swirling, cool and inviting. Or inviting to most. A grassy bank with a few reeds; deep green water, and just here, a pebbly bottom; and somewhere down there, lodged in the slime-slick pebbles where it had lain for most of Harry\u0027s years -\\n\\n A ring. A man\u0027s ring. A cat\u0027s-eye stone set in thick gold. Harry staggered at the river\u0027s edge. He deliberately flopped down to save himself from falling. The sun shone on him but he was cold. The blue sky reeled, became the grey, liquid flurry of slushy water.\\n\\n He was under the water, trying to fight his way up through a hole in the ice.\\n\\n Then the face seen through the ice, its trembling jelly lips turning up at their corners in a grimace - or a smile! The hands coming down into the water, holding him under and on one of them that ring. The cat\u0027s-eye ring, on the second finger of the right hand! And Harry tearing at those hands, clawing at them, ripping the strong flesh in his frenzy. The gold ring coming loose, spiralling down past him into the murk and the icy deeps. Blood from the torn hands turning the swirling water red - red against the black of Harry\u0027s dying.\\n\\n No, not his dying, hers! His mother\u0027s!\\n\\n Waterlogged, he/she sank; and the current dragging them along under the ice, turning and tumbling them; and who\u0027ll look after Harry now? Poor little Harry...\\n\\n The nightmare receded, its rush and gurgle diminishing in his mind, leaving him gasping for air where he clawed at the grassy bank. Then he curled on his side and was violently ill. This was it; it was here. This was where it had happened. This was where she had died. Where she had been murdered. Right here!\\n\\n But -\\n\\n Where was she now?\\n\\n Harry allowed his feet to lead him, following the course of the river downstream. Where the channel narrowed a little, he crossed a small wooden bridge and continued on down the bank. Garden hedges came down close to the river\u0027s edge here, so that he walked a narrow, often overgrown path between fences on the one hand and reeds and water on the other. And in a little while he came to a place where the bank had been worn away, forming an over-hanging bite not ten feet across. Above the still water in the pool, the path ended where the fence leaned dangerously riverward, but Harry knew he need look no further. This was where she lay.\\n\\n Anyone watching him from the bank opposite would have seen the beginning of a strange thing then. Harry sat down with his feet dangling over the shallow, muddy pool, put his chin in his hands, stared deep into the water. And minutes later, if anyone had been closer, he would have been witness to something stranger still: tears from this young man\u0027s staring, unblinking eyes which dripped from the tip of his nose in a steady stream to add their substance to the river\u0027s.\\n\\n And for the first time in his adult life Harry Keogh met his mother, talked to her \u0027face to face\u0027, and was able to verify the terrible things his dreams and her restless messages had caused him to more than suspect for so many years. And while they talked he cried - tears of sadness, and some of gladness at first; then of remorse and frustration, that he\u0027d had to wait so long for this day; then of white anger as things began to make more sense to him. Finally he told her what he intended to do.\\n\\n Upon which the wondering observer, had there been one, would have seen the strangest thing of all. For when Mary Keogh knew her son\u0027s plans she became even more afraid for him and voiced her fears, and she made Harry promise that he would do nothing rash. He couldn\u0027t deny her pleading, answered with a nod of his head. She didn\u0027t believe him, cried out after him as he stood up and moved away. And for a moment - the merest second - it seemed the bottom of the pool shuddered, shaking the water and sending ripples coursing outward from its centre. Then the pool was still again.\\n\\n Harry didn\u0027t see this for already he was making for the bridge, returning to the spot where it had happened all those years ago. The place where his gentle mother had been murdered.\\n\\n He found a place where the reeds grew tall, checked that he was completely alone, stripped down to his shorts and stepped to the river\u0027s edge. A moment later he was in the water, diving deep, then making for the middle where the current ran swiftest. Even there the river\u0027s pull was barely noticeable, and after twenty minutes of diving and delving amongst the pebbles of the bottom he found what he was looking for. It lay within a few inches of the spot where he\u0027d first thought it might be, tarnished and a little slimy, but unmistakably a ring. The gold gleamed through on the instant he rubbed it, and the cat\u0027s-eye stone held its cold, unwinking stare as of old. Harry had never actually seen the ring before that moment when his groping fingers found it - not consciously, anyway - but he knew it at once. It was that familiar. Nor did it seem odd to him that he\u0027d known where to look. Stranger far if the ring had not been there.\\n\\n On the bank of the river he finished cleaning it, slid it on to the index finger of his left hand which it fitted a little loosely but was not so slack that he might lose it, and turned it thoughtfully between his fingers, getting the feel of it. It felt cold even under the hot sun, cold as the day its owner had lost it.\\n\\n Then Harry dressed and headed for Bonnyrigg. From there he\u0027d catch a bus into Edinburgh and take the first train home to Hartlepool. His work here was done - for now.\\n\\n Now that he had found his mother he would have no trouble reaching her again, no matter how far he wandered, and he would be able to calm her fears and give her a little of the peace she\u0027d sought for so long. She would no longer need to worry about little Harry.\\n\\n Before leaving the spot by the river, however, he paused to look again at the big house where it stood well back from the opposite bank; and he stared at its old gables and wild gardens for long, long moments. His step-father still lived and worked there, he knew. Yes, and it would not be too long before Harry paid him a visit.\\n\\n But before that there was much he would have to do. Viktor Shukshin was a dangerous man, a murderer, and Harry must be careful how he approached him. He intended that his step-father should pay the price for his mother\u0027s death - that he must be punished in full - but the punishment would have to fit the crime. And no use at all to simply accuse the man, for what proof was there after all these years? No, Harry must set a trap, and bait it, and Shukshin must find it irresistible. But no hurry, none at all, for Harry had time on his side. Time would allow him to become expert in many things, and indeed he had much to learn. For what good to be a necroscope if he could make no use of it? As to how he would use his talent after he had avenged his mother\u0027s death: that remained to be seen. It would be as it would be.\\n\\n But right now his instructors were waiting for him and they were the best in the world. Yes, and they knew far more now than ever they had known when they were alive.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-necroscope-1/page-8.html","bookId":2436,"book":{"id":2436,"title":"Necroscope (Necroscope #1)","description":"Storyline: Harry is an English youth in school, and strange things occur as he grows up, such as a sudden increased intellect in mathematics, and the ability to fight beyond his experience after a teacher is killed.
