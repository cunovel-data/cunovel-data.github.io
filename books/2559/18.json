Should prevent us from starving to death for a few days longer,\u0027 he sneered cynically. \u0027Delay the inevitable for a while.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s all you\u0027re going to do,\u0027 Bushell reminded him, \u0027just delay what you know is going to happen anyway.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s right, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 asked Doreen. \u0027It\u0027s not going to change the fact that those bloody things will be up here with us in the next couple of days, is it? It\u0027s not going to help us get away.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 he agreed, \u0027it won\u0027t. But it might give us a little time and space.\u0027 Eight thirty-five. Pitch black. Jones, Wilcox and Elizabeth crept cautiously down the fire escape staircase towards the lower floors of the hotel. Hunger, claustrophobia and fear had combined to deadly effect to kick the instinctively cowardly survivors into action. Their hastily considered and half-improvised plan seemed increasingly risky with every step of descent. Jones had suggested they head all the way down and work their way back up. They had only made their way down as far as the seventeenth floor when he stopped and turned round to face the others. \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 Elizabeth asked, immediately concerned. \u0027I want to have a look,\u0027 he replied. \u0027What for?\u0027 \u0027What do you think?\u0027 \u0027But you said...\u0027 \u0027I said nothing. We know they\u0027re on the stairs. We don\u0027t know where else they are, do we?\u0027 She shook her head. Jones moved towards the door and gently pushed it open a fraction. He shone his torch out onto the landing. \u0027Anything?\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t see any movement,\u0027 he replied, his voice little more than a whisper. \u0027I\u0027m going to have a look around.\u0027 Without waiting for a response from either of the other two Jones slipped out through the door and onto the landing. He switched off his torch, concerned that the light might attract unwanted attention, and then cautiously moved further down the dark hallway to the first corner. The layout, as far as he could see in the gloom, was pretty much as Bushell had described. A long, wide corridor with a right-angled right turn which ran towards the central part of the building where, he presumed, the staircase and several thousand rotting bodies would be. He moved closer to the corner and peered around, holding his breath for fear of making any sound which might tip the balance and alert the dead to his presence. He couldn\u0027t see anything. It was too dark. Jones felt his way along the wall and paused at the door to one of the hotel\u0027s many bedrooms. Did he go inside? It would be worth having a quick look around the room before he returned to the other two waiting on the fire escape staircase. He wanted to see the layout of a typical room so that he could get a feel for what they were dealing with. How quickly would they be able to thoroughly check a room for food? What were they likely to find? Would there be a mini-bar or similar? Christ, he needed a drink. Imagine if each room had its own supply of booze. Surely some of the more expensive rooms on the higher floors would have... Jones reached down and tried the handle. Damn thing was locked. No surprise really. Bushell had a set of master keys which he\u0027d taken from reception. Elizabeth had them with her. He shoved the door again, hoping it would open. It didn\u0027t matter. He\u0027d go back to the... Wait. What was that? He sensed movement nearby. Jones felt something brush against his arm and he froze. He lifted his torch and turned it on. Ahead of him the whole corridor was filled with bodies. \u0027Fucking hell,\u0027 he mumbled as he tripped and staggered back away from the dead. Illuminated now and then by the unsteady light from his shaking torch, he saw that the corridor was packed full of corpses which had obviously spilled out from the staircase. They began to stumble towards him. He turned and ran back to the fire escape and hammered on the door. Elizabeth opened it slowly. \u0027Move!\u0027 he yelled, forcing himself through and slamming the door shut behind him. \u0027Bodies?\u0027 she asked over her shoulder as she instinctively began to climb back up. \u0027Fucking hundreds of them,\u0027 he grunted. He glanced around for Wilcox but he\u0027d already gone and was way ahead of them both. Cowardly bastard. He made a mental note never to put himself in a position where needed to rely on Wilcox for anything. The survivors pounded breathlessly up the stairs, suddenly not bothered about the volume of noise they made, just desperate to get back to the Presidential Suite. As he climbed Jones thought more about the progress of the bodies he\u0027d just seen. \u0027Wait a minute,\u0027 he shouted, stopping Elizabeth in her tracks. Breathless, he shone his torch at a small sign on the back of the nearest fire door. Floor twenty-six. It was worth taking a chance to see if this floor was the same as the one ten floors below. Elizabeth walked back down five steps to stand next to him. \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 \u0027According to Proctor they haven\u0027t reached this floor yet,\u0027 he said. \u0027We might as well see if we can find anything before we go back.\u0027 She agreed. He was right on two counts. Firstly, if the bodies hadn\u0027t yet made it this far up the staircase, they wouldn\u0027t have made it up to this floor at all. Secondly, it looked likely that this was their last chance to get food before the dead reached the Presidential Suite. \u0027Come on,\u0027 she mumbled. The two survivors crept through the fire door (leaving it propped open with a fire extinguisher) and moved slowly along the corridor to the first corner. Jones put his head around the corner and shone the torch down its length. \u0027Clear,\u0027 he said, the relief in his voice obvious. \u0027Let\u0027s stick to this end of the corridor and stay away from the stairs.\u0027 \u0027Suits me,\u0027 Elizabeth replied. The layout of floor twenty-seven was different to floor seventeen. This floor bore more of a resemblance to the luxurious twenty-eighth floor than any of the lower levels. There were several large suites on this floor and Jones was immediately hopeful they\u0027d find some food and drink at least. \u0027Got a key for an executive suite?\u0027 he asked. Elizabeth worked her way through the huge bunch of keys she carried. The door was quickly opened and the two of them slipped inside. \u0027So what are we looking for?\u0027 Elizabeth asked. \u0027Anything,\u0027 Jones replied, \u0027and make sure you split what you find into two piles. Keep one for yourself and we\u0027ll share the rest with the others.\u0027 \u0027But that\u0027s...\u0027 \u0027...completely fair. How many of those fuckers are down here with us? If they want more they can come and get it themselves.\u0027 He turned round and began to ransack the room. A little under an hour later Elizabeth and Jones returned to the Presidential Suite. They had with them the entire contents of the drinks cabinets of the Executive Suites on the floor immediately below. They\u0027d found very little in the way of food, but that didn\u0027t seem to matter anymore. The survivors gratefully took what they were given as they listened to what the others had seen on the other levels. Regardless of their nerves and uncertainty, what food they were given was eaten quickly. \u0027Feels like a last supper, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 Bushell said quietly. He didn\u0027t know who was listening. No-one had lit any lamps this evening. \u0027So what do we do tomorrow?\u0027 Proctor asked, sitting a little way behind him. \u0027Do we just sit here and wait for them, or do we run?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve been through this before,\u0027 Elizabeth sighed. \u0027Wilcox will run,\u0027 Jones smirked. \u0027You\u0027re good at running, aren\u0027t you, Wilcox.\u0027 Wilcox switched on a torch and shone it around the room until he found where Jones was sitting. \u0027Shut your fucking mouth,\u0027 he hissed angrily, shining the light directly into the other man\u0027s eyes. Jones laughed at him. \u0027Thanks for your help back there,\u0027 he smirked, referring to Wilcox\u0027s sudden disappearance on the fire escape stairs. \u0027Couldn\u0027t have managed without you.\u0027 Wilcox switched off his torch. He didn\u0027t know how to react. He was angry and he didn\u0027t like Jones mocking him, but he didn\u0027t feel able to retaliate. What was going to happen tomorrow was much more of a threat than Jones and his snide comments. \u0027So what do we do tomorrow?\u0027 Proctor asked again. \u0027Do we run or...?\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s just think about it logically, shall we,\u0027 Bushell suggested. \u0027They\u0027re still coming in through the front door, aren\u0027t they? And they\u0027re climbing the stairs because of the growing pressure from other corpses behind them. So what\u0027s going to happen when they reach the top of the stairs? They\u0027re not going to turn back round and start heading for the ground floor again, are they?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re going to keep coming,\u0027 Jones said ominously. \u0027When they can\u0027t go up, they\u0027ll start spreading onto the landings like they did on the other floor.\u0027 \u0027And even when there\u0027s no more room on the landing up here,\u0027 Bushell continued, \u0027they\u0027ll keep coming. Before we know it they\u0027ll be up against our door and then, when the pressure gets too great, our door will give and this place will be filled with the damn things.\u0027 \u0027Lovely,\u0027 mumbled Doreen. \u0027So you don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything we can do?\u0027 asked Elizabeth . \u0027It\u0027s like I said earlier,\u0027 Bushell replied, \u0027what\u0027s coming is coming. I think we\u0027re all going to die. The only choice we each have left is how we do it. Now I don\u0027t personally intend being torn apart, but I also don\u0027t like the idea of running either.\u0027 \u0027So what are you going to do?\u0027 \u0027Not sure yet. I haven\u0027t decided.\u0027 \u0027You haven\u0027t got long.\u0027 \u0027I know.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m running,\u0027 Wilcox muttered. \u0027You would,\u0027 laughed Jones. \u0027I\u0027ll probably run too.\u0027 \u0027What about you, Doreen?\u0027 Elizabeth asked. \u0027Too tired to run, too scared not to,\u0027 she answered dejectedly. \u0027We\u0027ll just have to see what tomorrow brings, won\u0027t we?\u0027 Next morning. First light. Proctor picked up his camera and nervously walked out of the main doors and across the landing, intending to carry out his self-imposed daily duty and ascertain how far below them the advancing bodies now were. He walked out to the staircase and leant over the banister. He immediately pulled his head back. There was no longer any need for cameras and fire-hoses. He could see them. They still had several flights of stairs to climb, but he could now see the first few dead. He ran back to tell the others. \u0027How far?\u0027 Elizabeth asked as he burst back into the room breathlessly. \u0027Not far.\u0027 \u0027How long?\u0027 \u0027Not long.\u0027 \u0027More specific?\u0027 Proctor shrugged his shoulders. \u0027Couple of hours maximum.\u0027 Doreen began to sob with fright. \u0027Shut up you silly cow,\u0027 Wilcox snapped with his characteristic lack of concern and compassion, \u0027all you\u0027re going to do is get them up here quicker.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-human-condition-autumn-6/page-18.html","bookId":2559,"book":{"id":2559,"title":"Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6) David Moody presents the final book in the acclaimed AUTUMN series.
