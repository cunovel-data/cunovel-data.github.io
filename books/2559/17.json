Set light to the building and watch the whole fucking place go up in flames.\u0027\n \u0027What good\u0027s that going to do?\u0027 wondered Bushell.\n \u0027It would distract them. Christ, the heat and light this place burning would generate would be more than enough of a distraction for us to be able to get away. They\u0027re not going to be interested in a handful of people sneaking out the back door if that\u0027s going on, are they?\u0027\n Wilcox\u0027s plan was met with a muted silence from the others. They each thought long and hard about it, but none of them were sure. It wasn\u0027t the wanton destruction that put them off, rather it was the thought of running again...\n \u0027What about the cradle?\u0027 Proctor said suddenly. \u0027We\u0027ve talked about it before, haven\u0027t we? Barry said there\u0027s a window-cleaner\u0027s cradle half way up the side of the building. We could use that to get us down, couldn\u0027t we? We could use it to get back up as well...\u0027\n \u0027What about power,\u0027 Jones grunted from the end of the table. The others turned to face him. \u0027How do you think you winch it up and down? Think the window-cleaners used to pull themselves up thirty floors by hand? No power, no cradle.\u0027\n Another idea quashed.\n \u0027Seems to me that if we can get out of here in one piece then maybe that\u0027s what we should be looking to try and do. Maybe we\u0027re going to have to find ourselves somewhere else to hide,\u0027 Elizabeth said dejectedly. Bushell shook his head.\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to leave here,\u0027 he sighed, his voice soft and tired. \u0027I can\u0027t see any point in running.\u0027\n \u0027Of course there\u0027s a point,\u0027 sneered Doreen.\n \u0027Is there?\u0027\n \u0027Yes...\u0027 she stammered, sounding far from certain, \u0027of course there\u0027s a point...\u0027\n Bushell shrugged his shoulders.\n \u0027I\u0027m not so sure there is.\u0027\n \u0027So what are you saying?\u0027 snapped Wilcox. \u0027Do we just sit here and starve? Fucking good plan, well done!\u0027\n \u0027What are you running for?\u0027\n \u0027Because I don\u0027t want to die,\u0027 Wilcox answered quickly.\n \u0027Good answer. Why don\u0027t you want to die?\u0027\n He struggled to answer. It was a simple enough question, or maybe it was a trick...\n \u0027No-one wants to die, do they?\u0027 he said quietly.\n \u0027But is it the end of your life you\u0027re worried about, or is it death itself that scares you?\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027Are you worried that you\u0027re not going to achieve everything you\u0027ve always wanted to achieve, or is it the pain of being torn apart by hundreds of bloody bodies that bothers you?\u0027\n Again Wilcox couldn\u0027t answer. Neither could any of the others.\n \u0027What point are you making, Barry?\u0027 Proctor wondered.\n He shrugged his shoulders and sat back in his seat.\n \u0027Sorry, I\u0027m just thinking out loud really. I\u0027m not trying to wind you all up. I guess what I\u0027m saying is that I can\u0027t see a way out here. If we run we\u0027ll find somewhere else to hide for a while, then something will happen and before you know it we\u0027ll be moving on again, and again, and again...\u0027\n \u0027Not necessarily,\u0027 Elizabeth protested.\n \u0027No, but that\u0027s probably what will happen. We have to be ready to expect the unexpected. Christ, I thought I was doing okay here until someone drove a bloody bus into the building!\u0027\n \u0027But running has got to be better than just giving up and waiting to die, hasn\u0027t it?\u0027\n Bushell shrugged his shoulders again.\n \u0027I\u0027m not so sure. That\u0027s what I used to think, but I don\u0027t know anymore. Every morning when I wake up, it becomes clearer and clearer to me that my life is just about over. We\u0027re massively outnumbered and society is finished. Christ, we\u0027re sitting here talking about risking our necks just to get food. What kind of a life are any of us going to have if getting the basics like food and shelter are so difficult?\u0027\n Silence.\n \u0027Still don\u0027t understand you,\u0027 Doreen admitted. \u0027What were you saying about death and dying?\u0027\n Bushell rubbed his tired eyes and explained.\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to keep struggling and fighting forever,\u0027 he said sadly, \u0027and I don\u0027t think any of you do either. If I\u0027m completely honest, I just want to relax and let things happen naturally. I don\u0027t think we were supposed to survive. So while I don\u0027t relish the idea of letting those things out there tear me limb from limb, I\u0027m not too bothered if I die.\u0027\n \u0027But that\u0027s...\u0027 Proctor was about to protest.\n \u0027It\u0027s not normal,\u0027 Bushell interrupted. \u0027It\u0027s not what any of you were expecting me to say. We\u0027ve been pre-programmed and conditioned by society all of our lives to keep fighting and keep struggling. All I\u0027m saying is that there\u0027s no point anymore. Just sit back and relax and let nature take it\u0027s course.\u0027\n More silence.\n \u0027No,\u0027 Wilcox said suddenly.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027I said no,\u0027 he repeated. \u0027No way am I just going to sit here and wait to die. Absolutely no way... There must be more we can do.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m with you,\u0027 Paul Jones said, similarly unimpressed by Bushell\u0027s words. Proctor looked up in surprise at Jones\u0027 sudden allegiance to the other man. Strange how their apparent dislike and distrust of each other had immediately been put to one side now that their backs were against the wall.\n \u0027So what do we do?\u0027 asked Elizabeth .\n That was the million dollar question that no-one could immediately answer. A heavy and ominous silence descended on the room as the six individuals quietly considered their limited options and the apparent hopelessness of their situation.\n \u0027Exactly how full of bodies is this place?\u0027 Jones asked.\n \u0027They\u0027re almost up to the twenty-fourth floor, I told you that a few minutes ago. Weren\u0027t you listening to...\u0027 Proctor answered before being interrupted.\n \u0027No, you told us how far up the staircase they\u0027ve managed to get, you didn\u0027t tell us how full of bodies the building is.\u0027\n Proctor struggled to see the difference. He wasn\u0027t alone.\n \u0027So what are you saying?\u0027 Elizabeth wondered.\n Jones shook his head. Christ, these people annoyed him. More to the point he was annoyed with himself. Why hadn\u0027t he thought of this before?\u0027\n \u0027A couple of minutes ago we were talking about getting out of here, weren\u0027t we?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027So how was Bushell talking about getting out?\u0027\n \u0027Do you always answer questions with questions?\u0027 she snapped.\n \u0027Do you?\u0027 he replied infuriatingly before re-phrasing and asking his previous question again. \u0027There\u0027s another way out of here, isn\u0027t there?\u0027\n \u0027The fire escape,\u0027 Bushell eventually answered.\n \u0027Which is still clear, correct?\u0027\n \u0027As far as we know,\u0027 he stammered. \u0027Why, what\u0027s your point?\u0027\n \u0027Is the fire escape anywhere near the main staircase?\u0027\n \u0027Of course not,\u0027 Proctor answered quickly. \u0027What would be the point of that? The fire escape needs to be on the other side of the building so that...\u0027\n \u0027Exactly.\u0027\n \u0027So what\u0027s your point?\u0027 Elizabeth sighed, confused and tired and unable to follow the rapidly changing direction of the conversation.\n \u0027What I\u0027m saying,\u0027 Jones replied, \u0027is that the fire escape gives us a way of moving around the building that\u0027s well away from the main staircase where we think the bodies are...\u0027\n \u0027And there\u0027s a good chance the bodies are still only on the staircase,\u0027 Wilcox continued, taking over from the other man. \u0027Which means that if we\u0027re careful we could still go onto the floors and into the rooms.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s the layout of a typical floor?\u0027 Jones asked.\n Bushell thought for a second before answering.\n \u0027Just one U-shaped corridor,\u0027 he shrugged. \u0027Staircase in the middle, fire escape at either end I think.\u0027\n \u0027And when you first set yourself up here, did you clear the place out?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-human-condition-autumn-6/page-17.html","bookId":2559,"book":{"id":2559,"title":"Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6) \n David Moody presents the final book in the acclaimed AUTUMN series. \n The human race is finished.
