A regional manager for a global finance house, Jake agreed to move his family overseas for a well paid two year posting. His wife Lucy and their two children settled quickly into their new surroundings. The people who found it hardest to adjust were those they left behind. Polly Humphries - Jake\u0027s well-meaning but highly strung and over-sensitive mother - still finds the distance between her and her son difficult to deal with. Mrs Humphries and her husband made their first visit to Canada several weeks ago. The trip did nothing to reassure the old lady. If anything it has made her more neurotic. Jake has grown to dread the weekly telephone calls from the UK. His mother usually phones on Saturdays. It is now the early hours of Tuesday morning.\n \u0027Jake? Jake, is that you?\u0027\n \u0027Mum? Bloody hell, Mum, do you know what time it is?\u0027\n \u0027Are you okay, son?\u0027\n \u0027Apart from being tired because it\u0027s gone midnight and I\u0027d only just managed to get to sleep I\u0027m fine. We\u0027re all fine. Why shouldn\u0027t we be?\u0027\n \u0027Haven\u0027t you heard?\u0027\n \u0027Heard what? Christ, Mum, it\u0027s the middle of the bloody night. I haven\u0027t heard anything.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s no need for the language, Jake, we were just worried about you, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Are you far from Vancouver ?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s on the other side of the country. It\u0027s thousands of kilometres away, why?\u0027\n \u0027Because something\u0027s happened there.\u0027\n \u0027What do you mean? What\u0027s happened?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think anyone knows. Your dad and I saw it on the news and...\u0027\n \u0027Look, Mum, I\u0027m really tired. You\u0027re not making any sense at all...\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, love. It\u0027s just that you\u0027re all so far away from us here and we worry about you.\u0027\n \u0027I know, I know... Anyway, what time is it there?\u0027\n \u0027Just after seven.\u0027\n \u0027What are you doing up so early?\u0027\n \u0027Your dad couldn\u0027t sleep. You know what he\u0027s like, once he\u0027s awake that\u0027s it. And once he\u0027s up and about I can\u0027t relax. He woke me up with his shuffling and his moaning so we both got up and came downstairs. We were watching the news and...\u0027\n \u0027And what exactly is it that\u0027s supposed to have happened in Vancouver ?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re not sure. No-one\u0027s saying very much. No-one seems to know very much yet.\u0027\n \u0027So you\u0027ve woken me up to tell me that no-one knows very much about what\u0027s happening in Vancouver ? Come on, Mum, I\u0027ve got an important meeting first thing tomorrow and I can\u0027t afford to...\u0027\n \u0027No. Listen, son, something\u0027s happened there but they don\u0027t...\u0027\n \u0027Well give me a clue then. Has there been an accident or a bomb or...?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I heard something about a bomb but they\u0027ve stopped talking about that now.\u0027\n \u0027So why have you phoned me in the middle of the night? This isn\u0027t little old England , Mum. This place is bloody huge. Just because something\u0027s happening in the same country doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s going to affect...\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m phoning you because they\u0027ve lost contact with the city, and all the places surrounding it.\u0027\n \u0027What? What do you mean, they\u0027ve lost contact with it? Vancouver is a massive city for Christ\u0027s sake. There are thousands and thousands of people there. Millions. You can\u0027t lose contact with millions of people just like that...\u0027\n \u0027I know...\u0027\n \u0027You can\u0027t lose contact with a whole bloody city, Mum.\u0027\n \u0027I know, but they have.\u0027\n \u0027What channel are you watching? Are you sure it\u0027s genuine? Are you sure it\u0027s not just a film or one of those drama-documentaries about...\u0027\n \u0027Jake, your father and I may be getting on but we\u0027re not stupid. I know what I\u0027m watching. It\u0027s the news and it\u0027s real. We\u0027re sitting in front of the television right now. Your father\u0027s next to me. I\u0027m only telling you what we\u0027ve heard, and I\u0027m only telling you because we\u0027re concerned about you, Lucy and the boys.\u0027\n \u0027So tell me again exactly what it is they\u0027re saying.\u0027\n \u0027Your dad says put your TV on, son. You\u0027re bound to have some news where you are. You\u0027re much closer than we are.\u0027\n \u0027Okay, give me a second.\u0027\n \u0027What can you see?\u0027\n \u0027Hold on, that\u0027s strange.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s strange?\u0027\n \u0027Can\u0027t get a picture on some of the channels. Cable must be down. Sometimes this happens when...\u0027 \u0027What about the radio? Try your computer. Try the Internet.\u0027\n \u0027Hang on, here\u0027s something.\u0027\n \u0027What are they saying?\u0027\n \u0027Christ, it\u0027s just like you said, they\u0027ve lost contact with the area around... Hold on, you said Vancouver, didn\u0027t you Mum?\u0027\n \u0027Yes son, why?\u0027\n \u0027Because the station I\u0027m watching here is talking about Winnipeg. That\u0027s miles away. And Seattle, and Portland. They\u0027re talking about a massive part of the country. Bloody hell, what\u0027s going on here...?\u0027\n \u0027Are they saying anything about what\u0027s happened, Jake? Do they know why...?\u0027\n \u0027Christ, Mum, they\u0027ve put a map up. It looks like it\u0027s spreading out from the west. It looks like...\u0027\n \u0027Where are Lucy and the boys?\u0027\n \u0027Lucy\u0027s here in bed with me, the boys are asleep...\u0027\n \u0027You should lock your doors. Don\u0027t answer the door if anyone comes. Wait until we know what\u0027s...\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s the point of locking the door? Mum, this isn\u0027t anything to do with...\u0027\n \u0027Jake...? Jake, are you still there? What\u0027s the matter, son?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing. Thought I heard something, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027Thought I could hear...\u0027\n \u0027Jake...? What\u0027s happening, son?\u0027\n \u0027Sorry, Mum, I\u0027m going to put the phone down. Look, I\u0027ll call you back as soon as I...\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\n \u0027Something\u0027s happening on the other side of the river. There\u0027s a fire. It looks like something\u0027s gone into the front of one of the buildings on the waterfront by the... Don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on. I can\u0027t see much from here... Hang on a second and I\u0027ll try and... Shit, that\u0027s all I need, the kids are awake now. Bloody hell. Lucy, could you go and...? Lucy...? Honey, what\u0027s wrong?\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter, son?\u0027\n \u0027Lucy? Don\u0027t struggle, honey, lie back and I\u0027ll get you a...\u0027\n \u0027Jake? Jake... are you still there?\u0027\n Over five thousand miles away, Mrs Humphries listened helplessly to the muffled sounds of her son, her daughter-in-law and her two grandsons choking to death. Within hours both Mrs Humphries and her husband were dead too. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-human-condition-autumn-6/page-1.html","bookId":2559,"book":{"id":2559,"title":"Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6) \n David Moody presents the final book in the acclaimed AUTUMN series. \n The human race is finished.
