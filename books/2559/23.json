{"id":112143,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\u0027Don\u0027t be stupid,\u0027 Jackson yelled as the desperate teenager approached. Skin lifted the bar high, ready to strike. With twice his speed Jackson let rip with a single jab to Skin\u0027s face, catching him on square on the nose and sending him reeling back. He dropped the bar and it clattered loudly to the ground. Jackson looked around anxiously. By breaking into the building he\u0027d opened it up to the bodies outside. They were now streaming inside in huge numbers. \u0027Time to get out,\u0027 he suggested to Skin who still sat in a crumpled heap on the floor, blood pouring down his face. \u0027Unless you like this sort of thing, of course,\u0027 he added. \u0027Could have yourself a real party now, you sick bastard.\u0027 Skin couldn\u0027t move. He couldn\u0027t speak. All of the anger and frustration and hate that had been released since the world had died had now suddenly returned, and now it was worse than ever before. He was crushed. He watched in desperate silence as Jackson turned and shoulder-charged his way through the dead and back out into the night. There were still a couple of bodies burning nearby. That, coupled with the movement around the gym, was enough of a distraction to enable him to slip away into the darkness. What about the kid, he thought? Forget him. Stay alone and stay alive. Skin slowly stood up and stared at the body of his father. It seemed to stare back at him. He stood motionless in the middle of the gym and, for a time, was unnoticed by the hundreds of bodies that had dragged themselves into the building. The room was filling up quickly. Skin was scared. All of his strength and bravado had gone. He needed help. He looked around for Dawn but she\u0027d gone, swallowed up by the faceless crowd. There must be someone who can help, he thought. With tears of sadness and humiliation running down his face he walked deeper into the gym. He reached the barrier he\u0027d built and looked over the mass of chairs and equipment. In the darkness he could see what remained of his friends and teachers. Over his shoulder the mass of cadavers moved ever closer. Skin climbed over the barrier and collided with the body of Miss Charles. He had to look twice before he was sure it was her. He began to talk to her. Wiping blood and tears from his face he began to apologise for what he\u0027d done and how he\u0027d behaved. Miss Charles wasn\u0027t listening. Along with the remaining seventeen bodies of his teachers and his friends, she lunged towards him and tore him apart. Jackson watched from a nearby hillside as the school burned. It was a dry night. The fire must have spread quickly through the bodies outside and then to the buildings. Whatever the reason, the whole bloody place was up in flames now. Good. He lay still on the grass for a while, watching as the bodies all around him stumbled towards the bright light in the distance. When enough of them have disappeared, he thought, I\u0027ll go and get myself something to eat. DAY THIRTY-EIGHT ANNIE NELSON After I left the community centre I came back home. There didn\u0027t seem to be much point in doing anything else. I had nowhere else to go. That was weeks ago now. Just over four weeks I think but I\u0027m not exactly sure. It\u0027s getting harder and harder to keep track of the days. I never felt safe in that community centre. People used to talk about surviving, but no-one actually did anything about it. There were always people crying or arguing or fighting but no-one actually did anything constructive. When I first got there I thought we might all bond together and make a go of things like we used to if there was a crisis, but we didn\u0027t. Most people were too scared and upset to even try. You see, everyone had lost someone else. Everyone had their own problems that needed sorting out before they tried to help anyone else. For most people there didn\u0027t even seem to be any point in trying to pick up the pieces. My friend Jessie (the lady I used to talk to at the centre) said that she couldn\u0027t ever see things getting any better. I kept telling her that they had to and that they would do eventually. No matter what hardships you have to get over, you always manage to do it in the end, don\u0027t you? It might be a long, hard struggle, but you\u0027ll always get there if you think positive and refuse to give up, won\u0027t you? I should know. My whole life\u0027s been a struggle, not that I\u0027m complaining, mind. Poor old Jessie. I lost her when those things got into the building. She tried to get away with the others. Don\u0027t suppose I\u0027ll ever find out what happened to her. There were a few people in that community centre who were like ticking bombs, just waiting to explode. It was only a matter of time before something happened there. I\u0027ve never been as frightened as I was when the fights started and when the doors were opened. It was all I could do to keep out of the way. I curled myself up into a ball and lay still under a table as the room filled up with those horrible, dirty, stinking things from outside. I know that they used to be people and that I should be respectful but honestly, they were disgusting. They made me feel sick to the stomach. We all have to go someday, but I hope and pray that I don\u0027t go like that... I just want to go to sleep one night and then not wake up again. I looked out for Jessie when the building started filling up but she must have already gone. Most people were trying to get out through the back and she must have been dragged out with them. I hope she\u0027s all right. I just kept my head down and waited for things to calm down again. I kept as still as I could and watched those creatures as they dragged themselves round and round the room. My old bones were killing me but I knew I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t let them see me. It must have been the best part of a day later when I finally saw a gap in the crowds. I stood up, as quiet as I could, and crept out of the building. I did my best to stay out of sight but I never expected it to work. I\u0027ll never know how I managed to get past them. It was good to get back home. I let myself back in and suddenly everything felt better. I collected up all the food and drink I could find and then dragged the mattress out of the spare bedroom down to the cellar and that\u0027s where I\u0027ve stayed since then. It\u0027s cold and dark and miserable down here but at least I\u0027m home and at least I\u0027m safe. I\u0027ve got a torch and candles and matches for light and I\u0027ve managed to find plenty to do to keep me occupied. I\u0027ll stay down here as long as I have to. I\u0027ve got books to read and I can knit and sew if I want to. Shame there isn\u0027t any music. I miss the radio. I miss the voices. The radio used to keep me company. I know that I have to stay quiet. If I make too much noise those things will find out where I am. Sometime I can hear them moving around. Sometimes I can even hear them in the house. Such a shame about all those people in the community centre. Such a waste. You don\u0027t have to make a noise and fight and scream all the time to survive. Look at me. I\u0027m doing perfectly well down here on my own, thank you very much. I\u0027ve lived through wars and terrorist attacks and flu epidemics and water shortages and much, much worse. I\u0027ve been mugged twice and I got over that, didn\u0027t I? The problem with those people is that they didn\u0027t have enough experience of life. I\u0027m eighty-four, and I\u0027ve seen just about all there is to see. The trouble with most people is that they want their problems sorted out today, not tomorrow. They\u0027ve had it too easy with their computers and their mobile phones and the like. They expect someone to flick a switch and make all their problems disappear but that\u0027s not going to happen, is it? People just have to accept that this isn\u0027t going to get better overnight. It\u0027s going to take time. It\u0027s going to take patience. Be quiet and keep yourself to yourself and everything will be all right in the end. It\u0027s very cold today. Must be the middle of October by now. Not sure what the exact date is. Anyway, it doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m sure I used to have a little oil heater somewhere. Maybe I\u0027ll nip upstairs and try and find it later, if there aren\u0027t any of them about. It might be in the bedroom. I think that\u0027s where I last saw it. I need to do something though because it\u0027s going to get much colder yet. And the cold and damp won\u0027t do my cough any good. I hate it when I cough. When I cough it lets them know where I am. I don\u0027t want them to know where I am. I keep thinking that someone\u0027s going to come. Someone will come for me eventually, won\u0027t they? They\u0027ll have a long list of who lives where and they\u0027ll tick them all off and realise that I\u0027m missing. Someone from the government or the army will come and help us sort this bloody mess out. I hope it\u0027s soon. I\u0027m doing less and less each day but I\u0027m getting more and more tired. Everything\u0027s an effort. I\u0027ve got to go out and get some food soon but I can\u0027t face it. I keep putting it off. I haven\u0027t got much left. Keep your chin up. That\u0027s what I keep saying to myself. You\u0027ve done all right so far, Annie. I\u0027ll be all right. I\u0027ll survive. DAY ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN UNDERGROUND John Carlton is a twenty-four year old army mechanic who, for the last one hundred and nineteen days, has lived underground in a military bunker buried deep in the countryside. Trapped down there with him are another one hundred and sixteen soldiers, less than half the number of troops that originally manned the base. A pale shadow of the highly trained and once powerful fighting force they used to be, these men and woman are desperate and terrified. Backed into a corner, all order and control has now broken down. Supplies are running dangerously low. Time is running out. For these men and women the bunker has become their tomb. They have no means of escape or salvation, and each one of them is painfully aware just how finely poised and delicate their precarious situation is. Their alternatives are all equally hopeless. It will not be long before their lack of equipment and supplies renders the base uninhabitable and yet they are unable to leave the bunker. The air outside is still filled with a vicious infection which will strike them down in seconds before causing their dead bodies to drag themselves back up again and walk the Earth relentlessly. Furthermore, the dead remains of the population on the surface have, over time, already gravitated towards the base, burying it under thousands of tonnes of rotting human flesh. Inside the bunker the situation is deteriorating day by day. Law and order is now non-existent and every man and woman has to fend for themselves. Respect, rank and position are long-forgotten things of the past. Everyone is equal at the bottom of the pile, and everyone is a potential enemy. Self-preservation is all. The next breath of air that the person next to you takes or the precious mouthful of food or water they swallow means, ultimately, that there is now less for you. Death is inevitable and is fast approaching. Whichever way these men and women turn they will die. And worst of all, each of them now knows that death no longer carries with it any certainty. The end of their natural lives may just be the beginning of something far, far worse. John Carlton is painfully aware of what is happening around him. He has hidden in frightened isolation in one of the most inaccessible parts of the bunker for a considerable length of time. His home for the last two weeks has been a dark and narrow service tunnel. All he has with him are a pistol, a few rounds of ammunition, some meagre supplies and his standard issue protective suit. Sound is carried along the twisting maze of tunnels and throughout the bunker. Although he cannot easily tell which direction it is coming from, he knows that trouble is uncomfortably close. He also knows that the sounds he hears are the beginning of the end. Somewhere in the underground base fighting has broken out. The supplies must have finally been exhausted. That\u0027s got to be it. That\u0027s got to be the reason for the sudden increase in the volume and number of shouts, screams and gunshots I\u0027m hearing. It had to happen sooner or later. This base was only ever stocked for a stay of around seventy days and we\u0027re now more than forty days over that deadline. The fact that we lost so many men and women in the battle meant that we were able to make what supplies we did have last a little longer than expected. It sounds like time\u0027s quickly running out now. The day of the battle was the moment I knew we had no hope here. I\u0027d always suspected as much, but until then I\u0027d done my best to remain positive and optimistic. It was the lack of information that unnerved me, the lack of any hard facts and clear instructions. I mean, I\u0027d heard the stories about the people on the surface and the huge number of casualties and what might have caused all the deaths, but while we were safe down here and the doors remained shut none of it felt real. I half expected to finally go above ground and find that nothing had changed, that we\u0027d been subject to some fucked-up military psychological experiment or something like that. It wouldn\u0027t be the first time. It\u0027s happened before, no reason why it couldn\u0027t happen again. The day of the battle was the moment I realised all the nightmare rumours I\u0027d heard were true, and that was when I began to prepare myself for death. No point in doing anything else, really. Unless something happens to make the surface safe and habitable again, we\u0027re all destined to die down here. The trick now is to drag things out as long as possible. Suicide isn\u0027t an option yet. I\u0027ll only do that if there is absolutely no chance of survival. If I can stay here until the fighting stops then I might be able to survive for a little longer. Who knows? I don\u0027t know anything anymore. The fight had already been raging for several hours when my lot were ordered to suit up and get ready to go above ground. There was no tactical briefing, because there were no tactics. There was no battle-plan because no-one knew what it was we were going to face. We\u0027d heard rumours of an enemy that numbered into the hundreds of thousands, but there were no hard facts or definite details to make plans around. We were told to go out there and just get rid of as many of them as we could. If it wasn\u0027t military, we were told, destroy it. We got ourselves suited up and ready to fight and we\u0027d made it as far as the decontamination chambers when the retreat began. I\u0027ve never seen anything like it, and I pray to God that I never do again. I only managed to get the faintest of glimpses outside before the doors were closed, but it was like hell on earth out there. Our boys were trying to get back inside but it wasn\u0027t a controlled fall-back. Blokes were just running for their lives. And behind them... Christ, following them in was a wave of thousands of the fucking things. Huge staggering swarms of these bloody things that looked like corpses. They were decayed and slow and awkward but you could see that they knew what they were doing. I watched them ripping our men and women to shreds. Hundreds of them trampling our lot under their rotten feet and tearing at their suits and their skin. There was nothing they could do against the numbers they were facing. The commander gave the order to lock-down the base and all we could do was watch as the chambers were sealed. Fucking heartbreaking it was to see men and woman that I\u0027d stood alongside and fought next to just left stuck out there. They\u0027d have kept on fighting for as long as they could - I know they would - but the bodies must have got them in the end. Rumour has it there was so many of them that they couldn\u0027t close the main bunker doors. There was too much dead meat and abandoned equipment in the way for them to get the bloody doors closed. I went back up to the decontamination chambers about a week later with a handful of others to do a check on some of the systems. We tried to look outside but it was dark and we couldn\u0027t see much. The hanger was still full of rotting flesh. The bodies were packed so tight against the doors that the bloody things couldn\u0027t even move. All that happened sixty-five days ago now. Since then I\u0027ve counted every hour and watched every long minute tick past. Hard to believe how much time has gone. Truth be told, it feels like I\u0027ve been here ten times longer than that. 10:17 am. Gunfire. I just heard gunfire again. Part of me wants to try and find out what\u0027s happening but I don\u0027t dare move. Maybe when it quietens down again I\u0027ll try. I\u0027ll have to move sooner or later. I\u0027ve run out of food. I don\u0027t want to but I\u0027m going to have to move soon. 1:35 pm. More fighting. More gunshots and more screams and shouts. Bloody hell, I wonder how many are left alive now? I can still hear screams in the distance. I keep imagining that I recognise the voices but it\u0027s probably just my mind playing tricks again. Maybe I should try and get closer now... Carlton crawled slowly back down the low tunnel where he\u0027d been hiding. His joints were stiff and aching. He tried to move quietly but, after many long days of inaction, his movements were frustratingly clumsy and uncoordinated. Matters weren\u0027t helped by the protective suit which he wore. He\u0027d kept it on because it gave him an extra layer of warmth and, if he was honest, because he was too scared to take it off. What if whatever it was that had done the damage outside managed somehow to get into the base? He had to take a chance and leave the breathing apparatus off. It was too bulky and it slowed him down. He held his loaded pistol tightly in his hand. He wasn\u0027t going anywhere without protection. The service tunnel led round into a second tunnel which was slightly wider and taller than the first. That tunnel, in turn, eventually connected with a corridor which led back deep into the heart of the base. He\u0027d see how far he could get. The lighting around him was virtually non-existent - a dull yellow glow from intermittent emergency lamps, that was all - but it was enough. The darkness was helpful. He\u0027d didn\u0027t want to be seen. Carlton paused for a moment to try and get his bearings. The bunker was a large, sprawling construction which seemed to meander aimlessly underground in every direction. Long, empty tunnels connected storerooms, mess halls and dormitories which were a surprising distance apart. If he was where he thought he was, the next door on his left would be the entrance to the kitchens. He crept further along the corridor, pressed tight against the wall, and then stopped when he reached the door. It was half-open. He peered cautiously inside and then gently shoved the door a little further open. No response. There didn\u0027t seem to be anyone in there. Carlton slowly eased himself into the room. It was slightly brighter inside the kitchens than it had been out in the corridor, and the relative brightness hurt his eyes after days of hiding in the darkness of the service tunnel. It was immediately obvious (and not at all surprising) that the whole area had been ransacked and cleared out. The cupboards and storage areas - those that he could see from where he was standing - were stripped empty. The large refrigeration unit in the corner was also open and its shelves too were bare. Carlton was about to leave the kitchen when he stopped. Something in the rubbish under his feet had caught his eye. He bent down and pushed a pile of plastic food trays out of the way. It was a lifeless hand, reaching up for help through the garbage. Working quickly but quietly he cleared pots, pans and other rubbish away from the immediate area around where he was standing. He gradually uncovered the body of Lynn Price. Price had been the officer in charge of the kitchens. The poor bitch had a bread knife buried deep in her right kidney. Huge amounts of blood had spilled out over the kitchen floor underneath the layers of rubbish. In places it was still tacky but most of it was dry. She\u0027d obviously been dead for several days. Nerves threatened to get the better of Carlton. Did he continue to push further into the base, or did he turn back now and scuttle away to the relatively safety of his dark tunnel hideout again? Hiding was by far the easier option, but he knew it wouldn\u0027t have done him any good in the long run. If he didn\u0027t find food and water soon he\u0027d be in serious trouble. He was already beginning to dehydrate. Christ, what he would have given for just a single drink of clear, ice-cold fresh water. The fact that he was standing in the middle of a kitchen, surrounded by pots and pans and discarded cutlery and crockery only made him feel worse. He pressed on. The kitchen was connected to the main mess hall. Carlton climbed through a wide serving hatch and took a few steps into the deserted hall. It was in just as bad a condition as the kitchen. It looked like there had been a riot. Furniture had been upturned and he could see the bodies of at least four more ex-colleagues buried in the mayhem. He was about to check the vending machines in the corner (which were obviously empty but which were still teasingly illuminated) when the sound of another hail of bullets stopped him in his tracks. That was close. That was too close. A moment of silence and then the sound of heavy footsteps thundering past the entrance to the mess hall. From his position he saw three or four unidentifiable figures rush past the door and carry on down the corridor. He waited for a moment before sticking his head out into the corridor and peering after them. \u0027Carlton...\u0027 a voice hissed from out of nowhere. Carlton\u0027s heart skipped a beat and his legs weakened with nerves as he looked for the owner of the voice. He spotted a frightened face hiding in a doorway opposite. Who was it? It was difficult to see but he was too afraid to get any closer. He stared again. Was it Daniel Wright? \u0027Wright? Wright, is that you...?\u0027 The figure on the other side of the corridor slowly stood up straight and then looked left and right before crossing over into the mess hall. Wright pushed Carlton further back into the shadows. \u0027Where the hell have you been?\u0027 he asked, his voice hushed and secretive. \u0027Haven\u0027t seen you for weeks.\u0027 \u0027Been hiding,\u0027 Carlton replied. \u0027Sensible. Best bloody thing to do around here.\u0027 \u0027What about you?\u0027 \u0027I was with a few others. Got themselves into a scrap and I took the chance to duck out and get away.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s happening?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re waiting to die, didn\u0027t you know?\u0027 Wright replied, his voice drained of all emotion. \u0027Place is falling apart. Fucking people are falling apart. Half the people left down here are already dead, and most of them killed themselves.\u0027 Carlton was silent for a moment as he took in Wright\u0027s words. None of it had come as a surprise. \u0027So what are you going to do now?\u0027 The other solider shrugged his shoulders. \u0027No bloody idea,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027Not a lot I can do really, is there?\u0027 Carlton didn\u0027t answer.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-human-condition-autumn-6/page-23.html","bookId":2559,"book":{"id":2559,"title":"Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6) David Moody presents the final book in the acclaimed AUTUMN series.
