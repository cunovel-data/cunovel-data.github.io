{"id":2559,"title":"Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6) David Moody presents the final book in the acclaimed AUTUMN series. The human race is finished. Mankind is all but dead and only a handful of frightened individuals remain. These people have survived through chance, not skill, and they are a desperate bunch: cheating lovers, workshy civil servants, permanently drunk publicans, teenage rebels, obsessive accountants, failed husbands, first-time cross-dressers, disrobed priests and more... Experience the end of the world as seen from almost fifty different perspectives. Part-companion, part-guidebook and part-sequel, AUTUMN: THE HUMAN CONDITION follows the individual stories of these desperate survivors through their final dark days. \u0027The best survival horror since Richard Matheson\u0027s I am Legend\u0027 - Wayne Simmons, author of Flu and Plastic Jesus \u0027Moody is as imaginative as Barker, as compulsory as King, and as addictive as Palahniuk\u0027 - Scream the horror magazine \u0027Takes the genre in a fascinating new direction. If John Wyndham was alive and writing zombie novels, they\u0027d read like this\u0027 - Jonathan Maberry, best-selling author of Patient Zero and Rot \u0026 Ruin","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-human-condition-autumn-6.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":24,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
