{"id":112133,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"With no time to properly consider his actions Wilcox turned the bus as instructed. The dark silhouette of the hotel loomed large in front of him.\\n\\n \u0027Where?\u0027 he screamed, desperate for some help and guidance.\\n\\n \u0027Just keep moving,\u0027 Jones yelled back. \u0027Keep going forward until...\u0027\\n\\n He didn\u0027t have chance to finish his sentence. The low light and the constant criss-crossing movement of hundreds of bodies made the distance between the bus and the front of the hotel impossible to accurately gauge. Tired and terrified, Wilcox jammed his foot down on the accelerator and sent the bus crashing through the front of the building. Their velocity was such that the bus continued to move until the twisted metal and rubble trapped under its wheels eventually acted as a brake. Eighty percent inside the building with only the last twenty percent of its rear end sticking out into the cold night, the bus came to a sudden, juddering halt in the middle of the hotel\u0027s wide and imposing marble-floored reception, its front wheel wedged hopelessly in an ornate and long-since dried up decorative fountain. No-one moved.\\n\\n \u0027My back...\u0027 Doreen eventually wailed from somewhere on the floor under a pile of carrier bags full of clothes and other belongings.\\n\\n \u0027Is everyone all right?\u0027 Proctor asked. No-one answered. \u0027Is anyone all right?\u0027 he asked again, slightly revising his original question.\\n\\n Paul Jones shook his head and dragged himself back up onto his feet. He looked across at Wilcox who was trying to stem the flow of blood from a gash just above his right eye.\\n\\n \u0027Nice driving,\u0027 he sneered.\\n\\n \u0027Fuck off,\u0027 Wilcox spat.\\n\\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 Elizabeth cursed from somewhere in the darkness behind them. \u0027Get out of here. We\u0027ve got to get out of here.\u0027\\n\\n The sudden fear and desperation in her voice was clear for all to hear. Without pausing for explanation the six survivors picked themselves up, grabbed as many of their belongings as they could carry, and moved towards the door at the front of the bus which Jones had already forced open. He glanced down the side of the long vehicle and immediately saw what Elizabeth had seen. A large part of the hotel entrance had collapsed. Although still partially blocked by the bus, there was now a huge, gaping hole in the side of the hotel where the main doors had once been. Hundreds of bodies were already swarming into the building from outside.\\n\\n \u0027Over here,\u0027 an unexpected voice yelled. Barry Bushell stood at the bottom of the main hotel staircase at the other end of the vast, dust-filled and rubble-strewn lobby. He gestured for the survivors to follow him. The light inside the building was minimal and they struggled to make him out at first. Wilcox was the first to see him. He ran across the room, closely followed by Doreen, Elizabeth and Jones.\\n\\n \u0027Come on, Ted,\u0027 Proctor pleaded. \u0027Leave your stuff, we have to move.\u0027\\n\\n Hamilton was busy collecting his belongings and supplies. Loaded up with bags and boxes he tripped and stumbled down from the bus after the others.\\n\\n \u0027Keep going,\u0027 he gasped, already out of breath. \u0027I\u0027ll catch you up.\u0027\\n\\n Proctor looked back at the other man who was clearly struggling.\\n\\n \u0027Just leave that stuff,\u0027 he shouted. \u0027We don\u0027t need it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I need it,\u0027 Hamilton groaned.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re coming!\u0027\\n\\n Come on you idiot, thought Proctor. Drop the bags, drop your boxes and get your backside over here. Hamilton was oblivious to the swarm of bodies that were now dangerously close behind him. They moved like a thick, heavy liquid slowly seeping across the floor of the hotel reception. Already the bus had been swallowed up and surrounded, overcome in the same way that scavenging insects might cover and devour a dead animal. Proctor looked around to see that the rest of the survivors had all but disappeared. Just Elizabeth remained, standing at the bottom of the staircase.\\n\\n \u0027Move you fucking idiot!\u0027 screamed Proctor. Hamilton tried to speed up but, if anything, he was slowing down. He was desperately unfit and scared. He glanced back over his shoulder and, seeing how close the nearest bodies now were, he tried unsuccessfully to increase his speed again. He couldn\u0027t do it. He couldn\u0027t make his tired legs move any quicker. It was hopeless.\\n\\n \u0027Move!\u0027 Proctor screamed again as he nervously backed away and moved towards Elizabeth.\\n\\n Whereas most people would have dug deep and done everything possible to cover the remaining difference between themselves and safety, Hamilton did not. He was already exhausted and the staircase ahead of him seemed to stretch up into the darkness forever. He\u0027d never make it. An eternal pessimist, subconsciously he had already decided that his number was up. He made one last weak attempt to move quicker but it wasn\u0027t working. The distance still seemed huge. Hamilton stopped and dropped his bags and boxes. Proctor and Elizabeth watched helplessly as the bodies swarmed around him and over him and dragged him to the ground.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s go,\u0027 Proctor sighed. Elizabeth was already on her way up the stairs. Proctor turned and disappeared into the shadows after her. Although he couldn\u0027t see where he was going, he could hear the others\u0027 voices up ahead.\\n\\n \u0027So what the fucking hell are you supposed to be?\u0027 Wilcox asked as they climbed. They had stopped momentarily to regroup a few flights up. Bushell carried a torch with him which he used to check who was with him. It was the first time that any of them had been able to see him clearly. He could see the puzzled expressions on their faces. Suddenly self-conscious, he didn\u0027t know what to say. He hadn\u0027t needed to explain his bizarre dress-code to anyone else yet. For a moment he felt foolish before remembering how good these clothes made him feel and how, when there was just a handful of people left now, what he was wearing was of absolutely no consequence to anyone.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m Barry,\u0027 he eventually answered, \u0027Barry Bushell.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So why are you wearing a dress?\u0027 Wilcox demanded.\\n\\n \u0027Because I want to,\u0027 he answered factually.\\n\\n \u0027You look lovely, dear,\u0027 Doreen said as she passed him on the landing. Already gasping for air and in need of a cigarette, she patted him on the shoulder and nodded her head upwards. \u0027This way, is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just keep going,\u0027 he replied. \u0027I\u0027m living in the suite on the top floor. It was as far away as I could get from everything that\u0027s been going on down here.\u0027\\n\\n Doreen nodded and kept climbing, her nervous fear helping her forget and overcome her tiredness. Wilcox waited on the landing with Bushell and Jones as Elizabeth and Proctor finally caught up.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s Hamilton?\u0027 Wilcox asked. Proctor shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t make it,\u0027 he said, panting with the effort of the sudden climb. \u0027Silly bastard got caught.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 Wilcox mumbled under his breath. He shook his head and carried on up the stairs.\\n\\n The climb to the top of the building seemed to take an eternity to complete. Weighed down by their physical exhaustion and the bulky supplies they\u0027d manage to salvage from the bus, the survivors struggled to make progress. Eventually, several stops later, they reached the impressive top floor penthouse which Bushell had claimed for his own. Even though their appreciation of material possessions and the value of property had been massively distorted by the events of the last seven days, the sheer luxurious scale of the huge apartment still impressed all of them.\\n\\n \u0027Nice place she\u0027s got here,\u0027 Wilcox hissed sarcastically as he gazed around the room. Some of the group had sat themselves around a rectangular dining table, others were sprawled out on a nearby sofa.\\n\\n \u0027Shh...\u0027 Elizabeth scowled. \u0027Leave him alone. He\u0027s obviously got problems.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve all got problems,\u0027 he sighed.\\n\\n \u0027Lovely place,\u0027 Doreen agreed. \u0027Just think of all the famous people who must have stayed here. Royalty? Film stars?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 Paul Jones grunted.\\n\\n Doreen looked puzzled. How could he not be excited by the prospect of sleeping in a hotel room that might have been used by millionaires and mega-stars?\\n\\n \u0027Imagine who\u0027s sat round this table...\u0027 she continued.\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 he interrupted again. \u0027Why waste your time thinking about people like that? People like that who could afford to stay here had too much money and not enough sense. You shouldn\u0027t look up to them. The only difference between you and them was the size of their wallets compared to yours.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was more than that,\u0027 Elizabeth protested. \u0027It\u0027s about glamour and watching them do the things that you always dreamed about and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So did you two read all the celebrity gossip and buy all the glossy magazines that were...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely,\u0027 Doreen said quickly.\\n\\n \u0027And I bet you used to watch soap operas and reality TV shows and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Never missed my soaps,\u0027 she told him with something approximating pride in her voice.\\n\\n \u0027Pathetic,\u0027 Jones snapped. \u0027Bloody pathetic. It\u0027s got nothing to do with glamour or anything like that. I bet you used to swallow all that crap because your own lives were pointless and empty.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks a lot,\u0027 Elizabeth said angrily. \u0027Let us know when it\u0027s our turn to tear you to pieces.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where are all your celebrities now?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027Dead, probably,\u0027 Wilcox interjected. \u0027Face down in the fucking gutter.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know what I think?\u0027 Jones continued, even though he knew they didn\u0027t care what he thought. \u0027I think that if by some strange twist of fate one of your precious celebrities had survived and was sat here now instead of one of us, you\u0027d still be treating them like some kind of fucking god.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As long as it was you they were here instead of, I wouldn\u0027t care,\u0027 Elizabeth spat. \u0027Sometimes you\u0027re so far up your own backside that...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got more food than this,\u0027 Bushell explained as he appeared from the kitchen, interrupting the conversation to the relief of the others. \u0027I\u0027m trying to make it last as long as possible. I\u0027m trying to avoid going outside.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d be trying to avoid going outside if I looked like that,\u0027 Wilcox smirked.\\n\\n \u0027Leave it, Nick,\u0027 sighed Proctor. \u0027What\u0027s the matter with you lot? We\u0027ve lost our transport and poor old Ted and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Honestly,\u0027 Wilcox laughed, not listening to a word Proctor had been saying, \u0027we wait all this time to find someone else alive, and when we find them it turns out to be a fucking faggot!\u0027\\n\\n The other survivors cringed with the sudden awkwardness of the situation. Proctor didn\u0027t know what was making him feel more uncomfortable, Wilcox\u0027s provocation or the fact that their host was wearing full drag. At six feet tall (almost six foot two in heels) Bushell cut an imposing figure. Strangely confident and unruffled, he sat down opposite Wilcox, opened a can of beer and passed another one across the table towards his aggressor.\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 he began, his voice surprisingly calm and assured, \u0027I\u0027m not surprised you\u0027ve got a problem with what I\u0027m wearing. Fact is I like it and I\u0027m not going to change. I don\u0027t know why, but dressing like this is helping me to come to terms with the fact that all my friends and family and probably everyone else I\u0027ve ever known is dead. I\u0027m not gay and I\u0027m not a fucking faggot as you put it, I\u0027m just a normal bloke who\u0027s decided to try wearing dresses for a while, okay?\u0027\\n\\n The wind had been taken out of Wilcox\u0027s sails by Bushell\u0027s brutal honesty.\\n\\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 he mumbled humbly as he reached for his beer.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, It doesn\u0027t matter what any of us is wearing, does it?\u0027 Bushell continued. \u0027It\u0027s not going to make any difference. Same as the colour of our hair won\u0027t make any difference either, or whether we\u0027re right or left handed. Fact is we\u0027re all stuck in this mess together and we\u0027ll need to work with each other to get ourselves sorted. Now then,\u0027 he said, his voice suddenly louder and more confident, \u0027who have we got here and what the hell are we going to do now that you\u0027ve made a fucking big hole in the front of my hotel?\u0027\\n\\n Dragging introductions and pointless, meandering hypothecations about what had happened to the world took the group through the last few hours of day seven and well into day eight. Spirits were temporarily high - Bushell had the company he\u0027d craved and the others suddenly found themselves in a safer and much more stable and comfortable environment than that which they had become used to.\\n\\n Proctor pulled up a chair and sat in front of the widest window in the suite for hours watching the night melt away and be overtaken by the first light of day. As the sun began to climb more and more of the shattered world was revealed. Whilst they had been down at street level it had been difficult to fully appreciate the enormity of what had happened to the landscape through which they\u0027d travelled. From twenty-eight floors up, however, the catastrophic damage and devastation was clear.\\n\\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 Elizabeth asked. Her voice surprised him and distracted him from a particularly dark train of thought.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 he replied, managing half a smile, \u0027you?\u0027 She nodded but said nothing. \u0027I was just looking out there,\u0027 he continued. \u0027Look at it. The whole bloody world\u0027s in ruins.\u0027\\n\\n Elizabeth took a few steps closer to the window and leant against it. He was right. For as far as she could see the world looked dead and was drained of all colour and life. Apart from the bodies in the streets nothing moved. From this height they could see for endless miles into the distance. The sheer scale of what had happened around them was humbling and soul-destroying.\\n\\n \u0027Much happening?\u0027 Nick Wilcox asked as he joined them. He\u0027d been sat on his own but he preferred the company of others. Elizabeth glanced back over her shoulder at him but didn\u0027t bother to answer.\\n\\n \u0027Not a lot,\u0027 Proctor replied. \u0027No surprise really.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t be too sure,\u0027 Elizabeth said, her face still pressed hard against the glass. She\u0027d diverted her attention away from the horizon to the more immediate area around the base of the hotel building. \u0027Have you seen what we\u0027ve done?\u0027\\n\\n Concerned, Wilcox peered down. The largest crowd of bodies that either of them had yet seen had gathered around the entrance to the building and were pushing their way inside through the huge hole the survivors had made with the bus last night.\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 he cursed under his breath.\\n\\n Proctor stood up and joined them. The sight of the massive gathering below them made his legs weaken with nerves. His mouth suddenly dry he swallowed hard and looked around for Bushell.\\n\\n \u0027Barry,\u0027 he shouted. Bushell appeared from the master bedroom and walked over to where the others were stood.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the problem?\u0027 he asked anxiously. Proctor nodded down and Bushell looked towards the ground. \u0027Christ almighty,\u0027 he sighed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-human-condition-autumn-6/page-13.html","bookId":2559,"book":{"id":2559,"title":"Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6) \\n David Moody presents the final book in the acclaimed AUTUMN series. \\n The human race is finished.
