{"id":112128,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"My heart is thumping and sweat is pouring down my face. I can\u0027t think straight. God knows how I\u0027m managing to keep flying. My legs are shaking with nerves and I can hardly keep the wings of the plane level. I\u0027ve got to keep going. I\u0027m approaching the airfield from the wrong direction but it doesn\u0027t matter. There\u0027s no-one else left up in the sky. I can\u0027t see anyone moving down there. Surely someone should have been out here to help by now?\n I have to leave my landing a little longer than I\u0027d like. What\u0027s left of Ellis\u0027 glider is strewn across the middle of the landing strip. There are pieces of plane and God knows what else scattered all over the place. I can\u0027t risk hitting any of the debris. I manage to put the plane down in half the distance I\u0027d usually need. I kill the engine and sit and wait for the propeller to stop moving before I move. I don\u0027t want to go out there. I can\u0027t see anything or anyone moving. I can\u0027t sit here all day. I slowly climb out of the cockpit of the tug and just stand there for a moment, listening to the loudest, most overpowering and terrifying silence I\u0027ve ever heard.\n What the hell has happened here?\n There are bodies at the side of the airfield. Without stopping to think about what I\u0027m doing I find myself walking towards them. These aren\u0027t people who were flying. There are a couple of faces that I recognise - Meade\u0027s daughter is one of them. The rest, I think, are the remains of the men and women visitors who weren\u0027t flying. They\u0027re dead. They\u0027re all dead. As cold and lifeless as the rest of their colleagues who are scattered in pieces around here.\n Inside the office I find Chantelle Prentiss, our Admin girl, dead at the front desk. The phone is off the hook next to her upturned hand. It looks like she was in the middle of a call when it (whatever it was) happened. I pick up the phone and lift it to my ear. Silence. I hang up and try to dial out but there\u0027s no answer on any number. After a while the phone stops working completely.\n The world is dead.\n I\u0027m up in the plane again, flying round and trying to find someone else who\u0027s left alive. There\u0027s no-one.\n The whole damn world is dead.\n JULIET APPLEBY\n \u0027So what time will you be home tonight?\u0027 asked Mrs Appleby, staring with frustration at her daughter across the breakfast table. Sometimes trying to get information out of Juliet was like trying to get blood out of a stone.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know Mum...\u0027 she began to answer, in a quiet, mumbling voice that her mother had to strain to hear.\n \u0027Because you know how your dad gets if you\u0027re not back when he\u0027s expecting you,\u0027 Mrs Appleby interrupted.\n \u0027I know, but I can\u0027t help it if I have to stop back...\u0027\n \u0027He has to have his meal before half-six otherwise it keeps him awake all night. And you know how he likes us all to eat together. It\u0027s an important part of family life.\u0027 \u0027I know.\u0027\n \u0027Dad just likes his routine, that\u0027s all. And he likes to know where you are. He likes to know that you\u0027re safe.\u0027\n \u0027I know that too, Mum, but...\u0027\n \u0027But what, love?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m thirty-nine for God\u0027s sake.\u0027\n Juliet Appleby closed the front door behind her and walked down the garden path to the car, pulling on her coat and brushing her long, wind-swept hair out of her eyes. She glanced back at the house before unlocking the car and getting in. There they were. She could see them both hiding behind the net curtains, pretending not to watch - Mum in front, trying not to be seen, and Dad standing just behind her. Hiding behind Mum, that was where he seemed to have spent most of his life, she thought. Inside the house he was king, and he let the two of them know that constantly and in no uncertain terms. Stick him outside and force him to face the rest of the world, however, and he couldn\u0027t cope. The accident twelve years ago (which was still a taboo subject that they weren\u0027t allowed to talk to him about) had destroyed his confidence and unbalanced his temperament. He didn\u0027t seem able to interact properly with anyone outside the small and tight circle of the immediate family. Outside Dad would always get aggressive or angry or confrontational with some poor unsuspecting person and it would inevitably be left to Mum or Juliet to smooth things over and sort things out.\n Juliet sat down in the car and started the engine. Poor Mum, she thought. She\u0027d dedicated her life to Dad. She\u0027d put up with years of his moaning and his mood swings and his tempers. Sometimes, though, she was just as bad as he was. As Dad relied on Mum, so Mum seemed to rely on Juliet. And who was there for her? No-one. On the few occasions that she\u0027d been brave enough to start talking about leaving home and setting up on her own it was usually Mum who played the sickness card and who came up with a list of reasons why she couldn\u0027t leave and why she had to stay and why they needed her around. She believed it. Each and every time she heard it she believed it. Why would they lie to her? Her friends at the nursery told her that she should just pack her bags and leave. But it was easy for them. She\u0027d left it too late, and now she was trapped, spending her time being paid to look after other people\u0027s children when she should have been raising her own. Fat chance of that ever happening. She hadn\u0027t ever had a \u0027proper\u0027 relationship. Men were either put off by the fact that she behaved like a timid old-maid trapped in a younger person\u0027s body, or Dad managed to put them off for her. She\u0027d long since stopped dwelling on all that she had gone without physically, but she often thought about the cruel irony of her situation - there she was, a thirty-nine year old virgin, surrounded constantly by the fruits of other people\u0027s sexual encounters.\n A quick wave to Mum and Dad (even though they thought she couldn\u0027t see them) and she was off. A ten minute drive into the centre of Rowley and she\u0027d be there.\n Juliet always seemed to be the first one to arrive at work. She was always there ages before anyone else. At the time she arrived at the nursery each morning there were usually only one or two other people around - usually just Jackson the caretaker and Ken Andrews, the deputy head of the infant school to which the nursery was attached.\n \u0027Morning, Joanne,\u0027 smiled Andrews, waving across the playground. Bloody man, she thought. In all the years she\u0027d been working in and around the school he\u0027d never got her name right. Occasionally she thought he did it on purpose to try and wind her up, other times she decided he was just plain ignorant. But the fact of the matter was he continually got her name wrong because he rarely had any reason to speak to her about anything of importance and also because she\u0027d left it too long to correct him without there being more embarrassment on her part than his. To say that Juliet melted into the background was something of an understatement. Years of her overbearing parents had virtually destroyed her self-esteem. Juliet had reached the point where she preferred it if no-one noticed her.\n As usual the caretaker had opened up the prefabricated hut they used for the nursery class. The classroom was always cold first thing in the morning, even in summer, and this September morning was no exception. Her breath condensed in billowing clouds around her mouth and nose and the low temperature made the tips of her fingers feel slightly numb. She glanced up at the clock on the wall. Half an hour until the children were due. Probably twenty-five minutes before any of the other classroom assistants and nursery teachers would grace her with their presence. As low, depressed and dejected as she could ever remember feeling, she began to prepare the room for the morning\u0027s activities.\n What the hell was that? Juliet stopped what she was doing and looked up. Fifteen minutes now to the start of class and she\u0027d just heard an almighty crashing noise just outside the door. It sounded like kids messing around on the concrete steps which led up to the classroom. It sounded like they\u0027d thrown something against the door. Juliet didn\u0027t like confrontation. She kept her head down, hoping that whoever it was would go away as quickly as they\u0027d arrived. Maybe they\u0027d just miss-kicked a football or something...\n Suddenly another sound, this one very different to the first. It sounded like someone coughing and choking, but it couldn\u0027t have been, could it? Juliet crept cautiously towards the window and looked outside. The playground was empty and still with the only movement coming from the birds flying between the roof of the school building and the rubbish bins and back again. She was about to turn round and go back to what she\u0027d been doing when she noticed it. She had to stand on tip-toe and crane her neck to see properly, but she could definitely see a foot sticking out over the edge of the steps. So there were kids messing around after all, she thought. With her pulse racing (she didn\u0027t like it when she didn\u0027t know what was happening) she walked over to the classroom door and pressed her ear against it. She couldn\u0027t hear anything outside. Very slowly she pushed the door open. Lying on the steps in front of her was the dead body of Sam Peters, one of the boys who had been in the nursery class last year. Panicking, she immediately slammed the door shut again and leant against it. Not knowing what she was going to do, and overcome with sudden nervousness and disorientation, she slid down to the floor and held her head in her hands. There was no question that the boy was dead. She\u0027d never seen a body before but she knew he was dead. His frozen face was all twisted and contorted with pain and there were dribbles of blood on the front of his yellow school sweatshirt.\n No-one\u0027s coming. Christ, no-one\u0027s coming.\n Twenty minutes later and still no-one else had arrived at the school. Juliet had been counting on someone else finding Sam\u0027s body on the steps. She\u0027d planned to act dumb and pretend she hadn\u0027t known he was there.\n Someone else should have been here by now. Where were the other children?\n Marie and Dorian, two of the other nursery helpers (who travelled to work together), should have arrived at least five minutes ago. So where were they? Were they outside? Had they found the body and had she just not heard them? Unlikely. She crept towards the window and peered outside again. She could still see Sam\u0027s foot. He was still there.\n As the minutes ticked by her conscience finally got the better of her fear. She had to do something. She couldn\u0027t just sit there knowing that the poor boy was out there on the steps.\n The main school office was directly across the playground from the nursery hut. Juliet decided she\u0027d have to make a run for it. She\u0027d open the door, run down the steps and then find the headteacher or the deputy head and tell them what had happened, despite the fact that she didn\u0027t know what the hell was going on herself.\n She had to do it now.\n Juliet put on her coat and, taking a deep breath, opened the classroom door and burst out into the open. Forcing herself to look anywhere but down at the body on the steps she half-jumped, half-tripped over the boy\u0027s corpse, landing awkwardly, twisting her foot and almost falling over. Managing to keep her balance she ran across the playground with the sounds of her footsteps, her heavy, frightened breathing and the thumping of her heart ringing in her ears.\n The headmaster of the school was dead. She found him in the corner of his office, buried under a pile of papers that he seemed to have knocked off his desk when he\u0027d fallen to the ground. She found the school secretary dead in the short corridor which ran between the office and the staff room, and in the staff room she found three dead teachers.\n In a vacant, disorientated daze Juliet roamed round the silent school and then the surrounding streets looking for someone to explain to her what had happened.\n Quarter past five.\n After what had happened at the school Juliet returned home before midday and had found both of her elderly parents dead. Mum was in the bathroom, sprawled across the floor with her knickers round her ankles, and Dad was (as always) in his armchair, staring up at the ceiling. Dribbles of blood had run down his chin and trickled down the front of his shirt. She\u0027d wept for them both of course (especially Mum), and had felt a real sense of devastation and loss. But after a while the hurting feeling had, unexpectedly, started to fade. In the strangest, perverse kind of way, she began to enjoy the freedom that the dark day had unexpectedly given her. She\u0027d never had the house to herself like this. She hadn\u0027t had to eat at any particular time (not that she felt like eating anything anyway) and she hadn\u0027t had to sit through Dad\u0027s choice of television programmes (not that the television had been working). She hadn\u0027t had to explain her movements every time she got up out of her chair. For the first time in a very long time she felt free.\n Juliet\u0027s small, quiet and fairly insignificant world had been turned upside down. She\u0027d seen hundreds upon hundreds of bodies littering the streets and hadn\u0027t known the reason why any one of them had died. She\u0027d tried to make contact with her few friends, her neighbours, the local police and pretty much everyone else she knew in the local vicinity but she hadn\u0027t been able to reach anyone. Her telephone didn\u0027t work. There were no answers when she knocked on the front doors of the houses of friends and family. Frightened and bewildered, but also feeling strangely empowered and stronger than she had done for a long, long time, she sat alone in her bedroom and waited for something to happen or someone to come and help, not that anyone knew she was there. At the end of the first day she moved Mum and Dad into the back room. When she woke up on the second day she dug two deep holes in the garden and buried them both. Dad had always wanted them to be buried together. She knew that Mum would have preferred them to be close but slightly apart. She\u0027d still loved Dad but, like Juliet, she\u0027d had enough of him too. KAREN CHASE\n \u0027What the hell do you call that?\u0027\n I looked at him for a second. Trick question? What did he expect me to say?\n \u0027I call it your order,\u0027 I answered. \u0027Full English breakfast. Bacon, sausage, scrambled egg, mushrooms, hash browns and baked beans.\u0027\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t look like the picture in the menu.\u0027\n He opened the menu up, laid it out on the table in front of him and jabbed his finger angrily at the photograph at the bottom of the breakfast section.\n \u0027I know, but that\u0027s only a representation...\u0027 I tried to explain.\n \u0027But nothing,\u0027 he interrupted. \u0027I appreciate that there will inevitably be differences between a photograph and the actual meal, but what you\u0027ve brought to me here bears very little resemblance to the food I ordered. The bacon\u0027s undercooked. The mushrooms are overcooked. The scrambled egg is lumpy. Do I need to go on?\u0027\n \u0027So do you want me to...\u0027 I began.\n \u0027That was what I ordered,\u0027 he sighed, tapping the photograph with his finger again, \u0027and that is what I expect to be served. Now you be a good girl and run along back to your kitchen and try again.\u0027\n A genuine complaint I can deal with, but I have a real problem when people try and patronise me. I was so angry that I couldn\u0027t move. It was one of those second-long moments which seemed to drag on forever. Did I try and argue with this pathetic little man, did I tell him what he could do with his bloody breakfast, or did I just swallow my pride, pick up the plate again and take it back to the kitchen? Much as I wanted to go for either one of the first two options, commonsense and nerves got the better of me. I picked up the plate and stormed back to the kitchen.\n \u0027Bloody man,\u0027 I snapped as I pushed through the swinging door. In the kitchen Jamie and Keith, the two chefs on duty, stopped playing football with the remains of a lettuce and stood and looked at me.\n \u0027Who\u0027s rattled your cage?\u0027 Jamie asked.\n \u0027Fucking idiot outside. Wants his breakfast to look exactly the same as the picture in the menu.\u0027\n \u0027Tell him to fuck off and get a life,\u0027 Keith sighed as he kicked the lettuce out through the back door.\n I stood and stared at the pair of them, waiting for either one of them to move. \u0027What do you expect me to do about it?\u0027 mumbled Jamie.\n \u0027Make another bloody breakfast,\u0027 I answered, \u0027you\u0027re the cook, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\n Christ, these two were stupid. Jamie was still looking at me with his mouth hanging open as if I\u0027d just asked him to prepare forty meals in ten minutes. All I was asking him to do was his job. It was what he was being paid for, for God\u0027s sake. If he\u0027d done it right first time he wouldn\u0027t have to do it again now.\n \u0027Fucking hell,\u0027 he complained as he snatched the plate from me. He studied the faded photograph on a copy of the menu stuck to the wall and took a clean plate from the cupboard. Then he took the food from the original plate, rearranged it on the clean one, warmed it up in the microwave and then slid it across the work surface towards me.\n \u0027You expect me to take this out to him?\u0027 I said, not quite believing what I was seeing.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he grunted. \u0027Looks more like it does on the menu now, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027\n Keith started to snigger from behind the newspaper he had picked up.\n Knowing that there was no point in arguing with either of the chimps I was working with I picked up the plate and turned back round. I stood behind the doors for a couple of seconds to compose myself and looked out through the small porthole windows into the restaurant. I could see my nightmare customer sitting at his table, looking at his watch and tapping his fingers on the table impatiently, and I knew that whatever I did he was going to give me a hard time when I went back out to him. If I went back too quickly he\u0027d accuse me of not having had time to prepare his food properly. If I kept him waiting too long he\u0027d be just as incensed... I decided to wait for a few seconds longer.\n Customers were the worst part of my job, and today I had been landed with the very worst type of customer. We got all sorts of passing trade at the restaurant, and there tended to be a couple of customers like this one coming in each week. They were usually travelling sales reps who were stopping in the motel just up the bypass. As a rule they were all badly dressed, loud, rude and ignorant. Maybe that was why they did the job they did and spent their time travelling around the country? Perhaps their wives (if anyone had been foolish enough to marry them) had kicked them out? Perhaps that was why they all came in here with an attitude like they had something to prove. Bastards the lot of them. It wasn\u0027t my fault they were so bitter and insecure, was it?\n I pushed myself back out through the door and stood cringing next to the customer\u0027s table.\n \u0027That\u0027s better,\u0027 he said to my surprise as I put the plate of food down in front of him. Thank God for that, I thought as I quickly began to walk away.\n \u0027You\u0027re welcome, you wanker,\u0027 I muttered under my breath.\n \u0027Just a minute, girl,\u0027 the customer shouted as I reached the kitchen door. The three other customers in the restaurant looked up and watched me walk back to the table.\n \u0027Yes, Sir?\u0027 I answered through gritted teeth, doing my damnedest to remain calm and polite and not empty his pot of tea into his lap.\n \u0027This is cold,\u0027 he complained. He skewered a sausage on his fork, sniffed it and then dropped it back onto his plate in disgust, sending little balls of dried-up scrambled egg shooting across the table.\n \u0027Is it really?\u0027 I asked with obvious sarcasm and mock concern in my voice. \u0027Yes, it is,\u0027 he snapped. \u0027Now you listen to me, missy, you scuttle back over to your little kitchen right now and fetch me a fresh breakfast. And while you\u0027re there, send the manager out to see me. This really isn\u0027t good enough.\u0027\n There may well have been some justification to his complaint, but the tone of his voice and the way he spoke to me was completely out of order. I wasn\u0027t paid enough to be patronised and belittled. It wasn\u0027t my fault I had bills to pay and no other way of getting the money to pay them. It wasn\u0027t my fault that...\n \u0027Are you going to stand there looking stupid all day,\u0027 he sneered, \u0027or are you going to go somewhere else and look stupid instead?\u0027\n That was it. The customer is always right, they say, but there are limits. Here at the Monkton View Eater, it seemed, the customer was always an asshole.\n \u0027Look, I\u0027m sorry if the food isn\u0027t up to the standard you were expecting,\u0027 I began, somehow managing to still sound calm, even if I didn\u0027t feel it, \u0027I\u0027ll get that sorted out. But there is no need to be rude to me. I\u0027ll go and get you...\u0027\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 he said, the slow and tired tone of his voice indicating that it was a real effort for him to have to lower himself to speak to me, \u0027I\u0027m really not interested in anything more you have to say. Be a good girl and fetch me my food. You are a waitress. You are here to serve me. And if I want to be rude to you then I\u0027ll be as rude as I fucking well please. You\u0027re paid to take it.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-human-condition-autumn-6/page-6.html","bookId":2559,"book":{"id":2559,"title":"Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The Human Condition (Autumn #6) \n David Moody presents the final book in the acclaimed AUTUMN series. \n The human race is finished.
