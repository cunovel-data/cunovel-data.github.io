{"id":2631,"title":"Glad Tidings","description":"Storyline: Glad Tidings (Here Comes Trouble \u0026 There\u0027s Something About Christmas) CHRISTMAS NEWS! READ ALL ABOUT IT! This is a time for families, for togetherness, for memories. On Christmas Eve, Maryanne and Nolan Adams tell their kids the story they most want to hear --- how Mom and Dad met and fell in love. It all started when they were reporters on rival Seattle papers ... and next thing you know, Here Comes Trouble! Christmas is also a time for ... fruitcake. Rookie reporter Emma Collins hates fruitcake; for that matter, she hates Christmas, too. When three Washington State women are finalists in a national fruitcake contest, the story is assigned to her. That\u0027s bad enough. It gets worse when she has to fly in a small plane (scary!) with a smart-aleck pilot named Oliver Hamilton (sexy!) and his scruffy dog (cute!). In the end she meets three wise women, falls in love and learns There\u0027s Something About Christmas.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/glad-tidings.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Christian","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":51,"category":{"id":17,"name":"Christian","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
