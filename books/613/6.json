{"id":29659,"no":6,"title":"A PATRICK\u0027S DAY HUNT","content":"I wash meself every Sathurday morning, whether I want it or no and \u0027twas washing my face I was when William Sheehan came in the door, and it no more than ten o\u0027clock in the morning. \\n\\n That\u0027s the way I remember \u0027twas a Sathurday, and Pathrick\u0027s Day was Monday. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God bless the work!\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You too,\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Would ye lend me the loan of a harness,\" says he, \"to drive Anne Roche\"—(that\u0027s his wife)—\"to town on Pathrick\u0027s Day?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The dear knows, says I to meself, if I walked two mile asking a harness it isn\u0027t to drive that one I\u0027d ask it! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will to be sure,\" says I, \"and welcome, but is it to town you\u0027re going on Pathrick\u0027s Day in place of going to Kyleranny? Sure you know yourself there\u0027s the fun of Cork in Kyleranny when the Hunt\u0027s in it on a Holy-day!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe so indeed,\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Faith you do believe it,\" says I. \"D\u0027ye remember one time,\" I says, \"when the Hunt was in it, Stephen\u0027s Day it was, you comin down Knockranny Hill hoppin\u0027 a quarther of a mile on your one leg, and the other foot fasht in the stirrup, and the owld mare you had that time throttin\u0027 on always. The Smith said it was the pleasantest thing ever he seen!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God be with the owld days!\" says William, \"that was long ago times, before I was married,\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thrue for you!\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will ye lend me the harness?\" says he to me again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come here now William,\" says I, \"you an\u0027 me is friends this many a year. There isn\u0027t one in the counthry I have as much wish for as yourself. The Divil sweep ye!\" says I. \"Sure it\u0027s follying the Hunt you should be, in place of goin\u0027 drivin\u0027 a side-car to town like a servant boy!\" says I, \"and you that was careing a puppy all the winter for the Hunt, the same as meself!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, that was the grand pup!\" says he. \"\u0027Twas a pity he died, and God knows,\" says he, \"I dunno in the world what killed him, if it wasn\u0027t a bottle of varnish he dhrank one morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Faith, says I to meself, it\u0027s aisy known what killed the poor pup. It isn\u0027t long ourselves\u0027d live if we didn\u0027t get our victuals! \\n\\n \\n\\n I drew out then, and I gave William a puck in the chest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you now,\" says I. \"Dang the harness ye\u0027ll get from me on Pathrick\u0027s Day! No! But you\u0027ll throw the saddle on the pony a\u0027 Monday morning and you\u0027ll come out to the Hunt to jolly yourself!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure the pony has the colour o\u0027 lameness on him since I had him at Cappagh Fair last Tuesday, under pigs,\" says he. \"That was thirty mile on him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Arrah! what signifies that?\" says I, \"that little horse is as tough as an eel!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And he have a sore place on his shesht, about as big as a thimble,\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And is it on his shesht you\u0027d go put the saddle?\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it is not,\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And as to go putting a collar and harness on a crayture that has the skin sthripped,\" says I, \"if it was an ass itself the polis\u0027d be afther ye for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed I\u0027m told so,\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Musha, Divil\u0027s cure to ye!\" says I, \"isn\u0027t it what ye can be tellin\u0027 your wife?\" says I. \"How simple ye are!\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n Not another word he spoke but to walk away out o\u0027 the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye have the man annoyed with your thricks, Conny,\" says me wife, \"why wouldn\u0027t ye give him what he was axing and not to be blackguarding that way? Maybe yerself wouldn\u0027t be so ready to go borrowing a harness for your wife?\" says she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe if I was married to Anne Roche it isn\u0027t me razor she\u0027d take to go cuttin\u0027 spuds for seed?\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Arrah, sit down to your breakfast, Conny,\" says she, \"and have done with your chat!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you,\" says I, \"if Anne Roche goes to town on Pathrick\u0027s Day, it\u0027s her own two legs\u0027ll carry her!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Glory be to God!\" says me wife, \"she\u0027ll be mad altogether! She\u0027ll tear iron!\" says she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Divil mend her!\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now as for the foxy mare I had that time, I declare to ye if ye had her within in the stable, and to be keeping oats to her for two days, she\u0027d have as much thricks and tashpy in her, and she\u0027d be as anxious for the road as a lad that\u0027d be goin\u0027 to a fair. \\n\\n \\n\\n If she was to be kept within always and getting what she\u0027d ax of hay and oats, it\u0027s all would be about it she\u0027d break the sidecar! (and faith, she was nigh handy to doin\u0027 that same one time!) But what can a crayture do that\u0027s working always, and getting black potatoes for her diet? \\n\\n \\n\\n I went to her St. Pathrick\u0027s morning early, and the full up of a tin basin of oats in my hand. The very minute I opened the door: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah—hem!\" says she to me, this way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Divil go from you!\" says I, \"wasn\u0027t the year long enough for you to get a cough, and not to be sick on Pathrick\u0027s Day? And if ye were coughing the full o\u0027 the house ye\u0027ll not stop within to-day!\" says I, \"ye can have your choice thing of coughing to-morrow!\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n And b\u0027lieve me, \u0027tis she that had that same. \\n\\n \\n\\n I rode her out quite and aisy, it\u0027s no more than five mile to Kyleranny, and the two lads of sons I have was legging it out before me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What have ye in the bottles?\" says I to the eldest little fella when I passed them out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Milk, Sir!\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what have ye in the bag?\" says I to the other lad. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me boots, Sir,\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n I knew well that was a lie for them, but I said nayther here nor there to them. \\n\\n \"IT\u0027S ALL WOULD BE ABOUT IT SHE\u0027D BREAK THE SIDE CAR!\" \\n\\n \"IT\u0027S ALL WOULD BE ABOUT IT SHE\u0027D BREAK THE SIDE CAR!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When I was passing Macarthy\u0027s, coming into Kyleranny, what was in it but William Sheehan\u0027s yella horse—\"Shan Bui\" is the name we has in this counthry for them yella horses with the black sthripe on their back—and he outside the door, and a bag on his nose. \\n\\n \\n\\n Musha, more power to ye William! says I to meself, ye stole away clever! But indeed it\u0027s aisy known that Herself had the kay of the bin! \\n\\n \\n\\n Himself came out then; he was afther drinkin\u0027 a couple or three glasses o\u0027 portlier to hearten himself, the poor fella, and he was \u0027long with me from that out from first to last, but not a word good nor bad he spoke of the wife. \\n\\n \"THE LIKE O\u0027 THE CROWD THAT WAS IN KYLERANNY\" \\n\\n \"THE LIKE O\u0027 THE CROWD THAT WAS IN KYLERANNY\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The like o\u0027 the crowd of people that was in Kyleranny that day never you seen—side-cars, and carts, and phaytons, and all sorts, let alone them that was goin\u0027 huntin\u0027. Ye wouldn\u0027t hardly know there was hounds in it at all with the dint of the people that\u0027d be around them, and it\u0027d be as good for you to thry to get into Heaven as to get past the cross roads. Ye\u0027d lose your life cursin\u0027 before the owld women\u0027d stand out from under your feet. Ye\u0027d have to be going around them this way, the same as a person that\u0027d be winding a watch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it sick the Major is, that he\u0027s not in it?\" says I to Tim Hurley the Whip (that\u0027s the son of an Aunt of mine by the mother), when I got to come at him, \"and Johnny Daly riding Monaloo?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has the \u0027fluenzy,\" says Tim. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it bad with him?\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s bad enough to-day,\" says he, \"but yesterday he was clear dead altogether.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a pity anything would ail him,\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Major was a fine man, always, and his family was a fine family. Sure me father used to say that in owld times if ye went to the Big House ye\u0027d get the smell o\u0027 roast beef when ye\u0027d be no more than half way up the avenue, and there\u0027d be dhrinkin\u0027 all day and knockin\u0027 all night, and if ye axed the change of a half-crown, it wasn\u0027t in it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Faith, I said to John Daly, there wouldn\u0027t be any fun, nor no cursin\u0027 nor nothing, when the Major wouldn\u0027t be in it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe I might please ye yet before the day\u0027s out,\" says he, lookin\u0027 at me ugly enough. \"Time\u0027s up!\" says he then, and with that he comminced to bugle, and away with himself and Tim and the dogs, out north for Dempsey\u0027s Gorse. \\n\\n \\n\\n Well, you\u0027d have to pity William Sheehan if ye seen him that time follyin\u0027 the hounds out the road from Kyleranny to Dempsey\u0027s Gorse. As soon as me bowld Shan Bui felt the horses throttin, and batthering, and belting the road afther him, he made all sorts of shapes and forms of himself, and as for William, if it wasn\u0027t for the almighty howlt he cot of the crupper of the owld saddle, he was a dead man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Blasht your sowl, William!\" says owld Dan Donovan to him, \"if you would save your bones,\" says he, \"you will lead him out now for a mile till you\u0027re coming up to Dempsey\u0027s, and when ye have the hill agin him then\u0027s the time ye\u0027ll get satisfaction!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Well, William had great courage the same day. He held his howlt on the little horse out to Dempsey\u0027s, and when we come to the gap into the southern field, below the house, Johnny Daly went away in up through the land. Well, at the third field west of where Dempsey had the turnips two years ago, there was about three foot of a stone wall before us. The yella pony jumped it very crabbed, but the minute he landed, and he havin\u0027 the fall o\u0027 the ground before him, he made a ball of himself, and he bet a lash on Dan Donovan\u0027s owld white mare that wasn\u0027t sayin\u0027 a word, only goin\u0027 from step to step over the wall, like a Christian, and with that he legged it away down the hill! \\n\\n \\n\\n B\u0027lieve me, William was promising God that time that if he come safe out of it he\u0027d howld to the side-car and not ax to go huntin\u0027 agin! But indeed poor William had great courage all through, only for the wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whatever way it is,\" says I to Dan Donovan, and we wheeling round the brink o\u0027 the hill, \"every horse that\u0027s in it will have his \u0027nough of grass ate before the dogs\u0027ll have them furze bushes rattled out, and, I\u0027m tellin\u0027ye, that\u0027ll quieten them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The divil a fox is there in it at all,\" says Dan. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, now,\" says William, \"there\u0027s a woman of the Sullivans\u0027 that has a little house beyond, is afther tellin\u0027 me a while ago himself and his pups has a nest in it some place. Last week she seen them walkin\u0027 in and out of it, like young pigs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe she didn\u0027t tell ye what way her sons has them pairsecuted with greyhounds and bulldogs and all sorts!\" says Dan. \\n\\n \\n\\n Well, divil such screechin\u0027 ever ye heard as what the dogs comminced then down in the furze. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s Fiddler!\" says Dan, \"that\u0027s a great hound! Maybe it\u0027s a cat he have nooked in it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Faith, well is he called Fiddler!\" says I, \"he roars most furious.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look over! Look over at Johnny Daly!\" says William, \"what bugling he have now! If it\u0027s a cat itself, what harm would it do them to ate her! It\u0027s little ateing there is in the like of her; them poor craytures of dogs does be starved with the hunger; and that\u0027s what has them yowling this way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look at Johnny skelpin\u0027 round the bog!\" says I, \"mind ye, he\u0027s souple yet, and he as gross as a bullock, and a back on him as long as a double-ditch!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whisht!\" says Dan, \"that\u0027s the Whip man screechin\u0027 to the dogs! They have a fox surely!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye lie!\" says William, \"that\u0027s Jeremi\u0027h Drishcoll\u0027s screech, I seen him within in the furze. Hi cock! Jeremi\u0027h! Bate him out of it boy!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, that\u0027s a fine sober fox,\" says owld Dan, \"he\u0027ll not lave his den for them. It\u0027s a pity now,\" says he, \"that the Major wouldn\u0027t have a fox keeping in a stable, and on a holiday, or the like o\u0027 that, to put a halter on him and lead him out before the hounds. Begob, he\u0027d give them a nice chase!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With that all the lads on the hills around let a roar out o\u0027 them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hulla! Hulla! Hulla!\" says they. \"Look at the cat! Look at he! Look at he! Down him! Land him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Every dog that was in it legged it to the roar. \\n\\n \\n\\n Well, if ye seen Johnny Daly comin\u0027 down the hill that time ye\u0027d think the fairies was afther him. He\u0027d jump the house, he was that mad! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Plase God he\u0027ll not come our way!\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n I declare to ye now, if you seen Jeremi\u0027h Driscoll leppin\u0027 the furze bushes, and Johnny Daly afther him with the whip, ye\u0027d as soon be lookin\u0027 at it as ateing your dinner. And as for Tim Hurley, you\u0027d have to pity him, sthrivin\u0027 to go around every hound that was in it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The dogs have her ate! More power! They have the owld cat ate!\" says Smartheen, that was sitting up on the wall behind us. \"She was dam cute! I thought she\u0027d besht them! The shkamer!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Twasn\u0027t long afther that till Tim Hurley had all the dogs gothered and counted, and \u0027tis he that got his own trouble with them! Them poor fellas of Whips catches great hardship. Johnny Daly faced away up the hill agin them, and the whole o\u0027 thim afther him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s for Bludth he\u0027s making,\" says I, \"and if that\u0027s to be the way, it\u0027s there ye\u0027ll see leppin!\" says I. \"Tighten yerself now Dan!\" says I, \"thim banks above in Bludth does be made up very crabby, and as for walls, it\u0027s not stones at all they has in them, but bog mould and slates!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Well, for all, poor William Sheehan had great courage that day. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your sowl to the divil, Smartheen!\" says he. \"Knock a few o\u0027 thim stones, boy!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With that he gives the yella pony a salamandher of a belt, and he coorsed him about three turns around the field the way he\u0027d knock the wind out o\u0027 him, in regard of he being out on grass always, and when he thought he felt him jaded it\u0027s then he faced him in at the wall. But in spite of all he jumped it very sevare and very ugly. Them Shan Buies is very piggish that way. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meself, I don\u0027t like them flippant leppers; I\u0027d like a horse that will put his two forefeet into the butt o\u0027 the wall, and give ye time to say two Aves and a Father before he leps out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As for my mare,\" says I to Dan, the same time, \"she boxed her knee a fortnight ago, and it\u0027s big with her yet, and faith she\u0027s avouring it always. And indeed that\u0027s a cross place in any case,\" says I. \"God bless ye, Smartheen,\" says I, \"throw down a couple more o\u0027 them stones!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m tellin\u0027 ye Smartheen was a decent civil boy always. \\n\\n \\n\\n We follied on the bohireens afther that, ye\u0027d think \u0027twas a wedding with all that was in it! Throttin\u0027 and steppin\u0027 their horses, and the hounds and the ladies and gentlemen and all out before us. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Faith,\" says I, \"they\u0027d get as nice a shweat this way as what they\u0027d get in any quadhreel whatever in Dublin Castle,\" says I, \"and as for jogglin\u0027 and jowltin\u0027,\" says I, \"any one\u0027d be the better o\u0027 this in his health while he\u0027ll live,\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n Indeed, all that was in it was teeming down with the heat before we were up into Bludth at all. \\n\\n \\n\\n Comin\u0027 up out o\u0027 the bohireen there was a stick left across in the end of it, keepin\u0027 in calves; a middlin\u0027 heavy pole, and the two ends fasht. If it was in the Cork Park races ye wouldn\u0027t see as much fun as what we knocked out of it with young Tom Dennehy! Sure he was ridin\u0027 the Docthor\u0027s grey mare, an\u0027 he dhressed out, and grand yalla gaiters on him, and he in dhread of his life! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dennehy took great use out o\u0027 the bohireens all through!\" says one of the lads \"\u0027tis time for him to throw a lep for us now!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It\u0027s well the Docthor wasn\u0027t looking at them that time, and they weltin\u0027 the mare with switches and stones, and Dennehy howlding her back from the lep when she\u0027d be gethered for it.—Begob! he fell heavy when the crayture jumped in the spite of him! And there\u0027s where the fun was! \\n\\n \\n\\n Ye wouldn\u0027t blame him to be afraid if it wasn\u0027t for the dirty little boasting he has always. But indeed \u0027twould stun any one to hear the talk of the Dennehys. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mind yourself now, William,\" says Dan, afther the three of us had a place made out above on the hill for ourselves to stand aisy. \"The hill tops is lakes afther the rain,\" says he, \"though be Jingo!\" says he, \"that little horse went over the hill very knacky!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look at Smartheen comin\u0027 down the bohireen over!\" says I, \"what have he in the bag? Ye\u0027d say it was a side o\u0027 bacon with all the dogs that\u0027s snortin\u0027 afther it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be dom!\" says William, \"but it\u0027s a fox! Look at Johnny Daly that has all his own dogs dhrove in under the wall. B\u0027lieve me, them two has it settled out! We\u0027ll see sport now,\" says he, \"afther Smartheen\u0027ll throw down the owld bag and give the fox a couple of kicks for to rise his heart for him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Well, what it was vexed Johnny Daly I dunno, but he was mad altogether! He lepped out the wall before him, and he as wicked with the passion as that he didn\u0027t roar, nor say a word, till he had Smartheen cot by the coat and the whip ruz to him to sthrike him! Ye wouldn\u0027t know what was the two o\u0027 thim sayin\u0027, but Smartheen thought to run, and \u0027twas then Johnny cot the bag secondly to take it from him. Every lad that was in it comminced to cheer and to bawl when they seen the two o\u0027 thim in howlts. I believe meself let a few screeches, but as for William, if it was his father that he seen took by the polis, an\u0027 he dhrunk, he wouldn\u0027t have more nature for him than what he showed to that boy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hon-a-maun-dhiaoul! He\u0027ll have him dhragged off the horse!\" says Dan. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He will! He will!\" says I, \"he\u0027s dam stubborn!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Maybe if it wasn\u0027t for the way Johnny crooked the owld horse with the spur, sthrivin\u0027 to squeeze the leg around him, he\u0027d have held his howlt, but a Turk couldn\u0027t stand it with the hoist that owld Monaloo let out of him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s down!\" says Dan. \"He\u0027s dead! \u0027Tis on his head he\u0027s fallen!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re a liar!\" says William, \"it\u0027s on the fox he fell! The big mastheen of a tyrant!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Twasn\u0027t long then till the whole of us was gathered lookin\u0027 at Johnny, and he ravin\u0027 like a cat in the measles, and every bit that was on him desthroyed with the gutther, and says he to Smartheen, givin\u0027 a bitter big curse: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s all I wish,\" says he, \"that ye were a football before me! Ye wouldn\u0027t last me three kicks!\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Twould dhrive a chill through your stomach to be leshnin\u0027 to the talk he had. And sure the fox was as flat as the palm o\u0027 yer hand within in the bag! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, fie, fie!\" says Dan, \"our fox is gone from us!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Indeed, ye wouldn\u0027t like to be lookin\u0027 at the crayture. Johnny Daly\u0027s a very weighty man, and sure it\u0027s the last sthraw, as they say, put the hump on the camel. But in any case Smartheen battled it out well, and all that was in it was givin\u0027 him applauses. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yerself knows Bludth, that there\u0027s as many hooks and pooks in it as that a person\u0027d be moidthered before he\u0027d have them gone around, let alone dogs, and horses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"B\u0027lieve me,\" says Dan, \"\u0027tis as good for them to give over; sure we\u0027re sick and tired waitin\u0027 on them. The fox that keeps this hill has a sthrong dungeon, and sorra fear of him to lave it for to be sporting for them. What a fool he is!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yerrah shut yer mouth, Dan!\" says I, \"thim lads on the paikeen south is screechin\u0027 like as if they seen somethin\u0027! What have ye over there?\" says I, lettin\u0027 a roar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yerrah, what are they sayin\u0027 at all?\" says William, \"it\u0027s like pigs talkin\u0027! Sure I can\u0027t understand them no more than if I was a fool!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With that the dogs comminced to gallop, and away with the whole of us. Well, William had great courage always. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tis down the gully we should go, and we\u0027ll be before them whatever side they\u0027ll turn,\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Musha, the divil go from ye!\" says I, \"maybe it\u0027s down the chimbly ye\u0027d have us go! Sure a man itself couldn\u0027t stand in it, it\u0027s that steep!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, nor ten men couldn\u0027t!\" says Dan. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If it was the ugliest place in life, ye\u0027ll be hard set to find a betther,\" says William. \\n\\n \\n\\n Well, afther all, we went down in it, as well as another, and you may say there was scroogin\u0027 and scramblin\u0027, and thim that was afther us was bet down on us like a load o\u0027 hay, and thim that was before us cursin\u0027 black and blue for the way ourselves was squeezin\u0027 them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Faith! We\u0027re as throng as three in a bed!\" says Dan, \"the dogs could run away in their choice place and divil a one of us would know what side they went!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s gone north agin!\" says a lad above on the hill, and every one that was in it turned about in the gully and up with them up it agin. \\n\\n \"HE\u0027S GONE NORTH AGIN!\" \\n\\n \"HE\u0027S GONE NORTH AGIN!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe if it was himself was down in it he wouldn\u0027t have so much chat about goin\u0027 north!\" says I, \"and we twistin\u0027 in it like ye\u0027d be dancin\u0027 a reel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But as for William\u0027s little horse, if it was the roof of the chapel he was on he\u0027d run in it like a bird, rocks or slates or any other thing, he wouldn\u0027t give a dang for them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sight\u0027d lave your eyes if ye were lookin\u0027 at us afther that, comin\u0027 down out of Bludth, with slidin\u0027 and slippin\u0027, and buck leps and all sorts, and the dogs yowlin\u0027 away through the counthry from us. Great banks there was below in the fields. Every one o\u0027 them that we come into my mare would crouch like a hen before it, and she\u0027d let a screech, and over with her, and wouldn\u0027t lave an iron on it. That was her routheen always, only when she soured by the dint of the Shan Bui, that was baulking with William out before her. When I\u0027d have to dhrive her over before me she\u0027d be waitin\u0027 on me the far side of the fence, ateing grass, till I\u0027d come afther her. She is a grand mare indeed, and high ginthry does be jumpin\u0027 mad to buy her foals. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Twasn\u0027t long till we come up to the dogs, where they were searchin\u0027 and snuffin\u0027 round the four corners of the field, and divil a smell could they get. We seen a lad then standing up on a rock, waving. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s gone wesht up the road!\" says he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did ye see him?\" says Johnny Daly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Faith I did so!\" says me lad, \"and he was the most courageous thief of a fox ever ye seen!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I went up to the lad. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where did ye get the two coats, ye\u0027re afther throwing behind the wall?\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tis aiqual to you where I got them,\" says me lad, \"ax no questions and ye\u0027ll be told no lies!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Faith, there\u0027s no occasion,\" says I, \"sure it\u0027s you is good-natured to be carryin\u0027 the two coats that was on my two sons this morning,\" says I, \"and you bloated with running,\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n Divil a word he said, but away with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thim two young lads o\u0027 mine will be apt to get a bating before night!\" says I to meself, \"and they\u0027re in the want of it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Forrad! Forrad!\" says Johnny to the dogs, that was whining most peevish round and about, and you\u0027d think if he never had a nose on him he\u0027d get the smell o\u0027 the paraffin oil, it was that parsevarin\u0027. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two mile we legged it then, and the biggest walls in the counthry was in it, and God help them that had to be building them afther us! Comin\u0027 up Milleenavillen, William and a few more of us turned about round the butt o\u0027 the hill, for fear we\u0027d be bet out entirely, and it wasn\u0027t long till we met with a great mountaineer of a big bank down in the widow Brinckley\u0027s land. Meself dhrew out back a couple o\u0027 fields, and knocked a few sticks that was in a gap, but me brave William didn\u0027t do but to let a roar to the Shan Bui, and to land him two clouts in the jaw comin\u0027 into the bank. The Shan Bui lepped up on to it, as loose as a hare, with the fright, but what\u0027d be before him only posts that the widow Brinckley had dhrove in the far side o\u0027 the bank, and ropes on them, and clothes hangin\u0027 out on them. He put a hump on himself like a ferret when he seen them, but if all the polis in Ireland was below mindin\u0027 the clothes, he\u0027d have to change his feet and lep out on to them, with the gallop he had on him, and he cot the two hind legs in the ropes, and himself and William and the clothes was threwn down in the field. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s dead!\" says I. \"\u0027Twould kill him if he was a bull!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Twould, or if he was an ass,\" says young Tom Dennehy, that was on the eastern side o\u0027 the fence. \\n\\n \\n\\n Well afther all, not a bit in the world was on him, only a tooth he had was stirrin\u0027 always in his head afther it. But I\u0027m tellin\u0027 ye, the widow Brinckley faced him the same as Jeffrey faced his cat, as they say, in regard of some sort of a petticoat the Shan Bui had dhraggin\u0027 afther him. \\n\\n \"THE WIDOW BRINCKLEY FACED HIM THE SAME AS JEFFREY FACED HIS CAT\" \\n\\n \"THE WIDOW BRINCKLEY FACED HIM THE SAME AS JEFFREY FACED HIS CAT\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Out with the whole of us then from her into the road and left her afther us, and she dhrawing down saints and divils and the price o\u0027 the petticoat on us. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It couldn\u0027t be,\" says I, \"that it\u0027s into William\u0027s land the dogs is facin\u0027 now! Look at the line they\u0027re going beyond over the hill!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Begob, it is!\" says Dan. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If that be so it\u0027d be betther for William to go under the sod!\" says I. \\n\\n \\n\\n Faith, I believe the divil was always busy with the Shan Bui! The very minute he got the smell o\u0027 the road under his feet, he comminced firin\u0027 and lashin\u0027, and when he had William loosened, it\u0027s then he legged it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s diddled now entirely!\" says I, \"that horse won\u0027t stand or stay till he lands him within his own yard. The Lord look down in pity on William this day! Herself\u0027ll ate the face off him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Begob, the Shan Bui kept the one gallop always, the same as a thrain, and we battherin\u0027 the road afther him, and the dogs and all screechin\u0027 down the hill before us. Your heart\u0027d rise if ye were listenin\u0027 to them! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027ll run to the say with him!\" says Dan, \"the two o\u0027 them\u0027ll be cliffted!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sorra fear of him!\" says I, \"what a fool he is! Look at him now, tightening himself comin\u0027 down to the gate!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Begannies! The villyan wheeled into the yard as nate as a bicycle, and every hound in the pack was in it before him! \\n\\n \"THE VILLYAN WHEELED INTO THE YARD AS NATE AS A BICYCLE\" \\n\\n \"THE VILLYAN WHEELED INTO THE YARD AS NATE AS A BICYCLE\" \\n\\n \\n\\n * * * * * \\n\\n \\n\\n Twas the week afther, and I goin\u0027 to owld Dick Courtney\u0027s funeral (the Lord have mercy on him) and who would I meet only Anne Roche! \\n\\n \\n\\n Well now I declare to ye, divil such an ateing ever I got from any woman! The dogs wouldn\u0027t pick me bones afther her! Sure she pitched all that was within and without to the Seventeen Divils. \\n\\n \\n\\n And sure there was no blame on me at all, only she seen them two young whipsthers o\u0027 mine when they thrown the owld bag they had with the ferret\u0027s bed back into her hen-house, and they near dead with thralling it out through the counthry. \\n\\n \\n\\n A half a gallon of paraffin they had soaked in it. If it was herself and not meself had one and eightpence lost by it she might be talkin\u0027. \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m told she gave William the Seven Shows of Cork on the head of it, but indeed poor William had great courage the same day. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2038/58005.html","bookId":613,"book":{"id":613,"title":"Some Irish Yesterdays","description":"简介： Twelfth Day was accordingly added to Miss Gerraghty\u0027s list of Bath Holidaysthat is to say, the list allotted to Miss Gerraghty\u0027s visitors.
