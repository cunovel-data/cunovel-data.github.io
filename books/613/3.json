{"id":29656,"no":3,"title":"BOON COMPANIONS","content":"\"D\u0027ye remember of Gill and Poor Fellow, greyhounds that was in it long ago?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I did not. In the long and tear-stained annals of the family dogs but one greyhound was in my memory, the saintly and beautiful Gazelle, own niece to \"Master McGrath,\" as was recited with bated breath to new governesses and other of the unenlightened, coupled with large statements as to her uncomputable value had not her tail in youth been shut into a stable door and given a double angle like a bayonet. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rickeen was occupied, to some extent, in felling a young ash tree. He swung in half a score of blows that made it shiver, and presently came to the expected pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Faith thim was the dogsâ€”! My brother Tom was butler here the same time. B\u0027leeve me \u0027twas himself was souple! He\u0027d run home any minute in the day, two miles, and ye wouldn\u0027t hardly feel him gone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This remarkable accomplishment on the part of the butler was allowed to sink in, as it deserved. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He had a tarrier, and one day going through the Wood of Annagh himself and the tarrier wakened a hare, and the two o\u0027 thim was hunting her through and fro, and he cursing the full of a house on the tarrier. He shtud then on the big rock that\u0027s in it, and he let a whistle on his two fingers. The two greyhounds was sthretched within at the kitchen fire up at the Big House, and sorra word of lie I\u0027m tellin\u0027, but Poor Fellow put an ear on him, and the two of them legged it out of the kitchen and away with them to the wood, and they never stopped nor stayed till they found Tom, and themselves and the tarrier killed the hare.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The big rock and the Big House were severed by an Irish mile of tree trunks and briars, but criticism is the last thing required from a listener, and I hope I played my part. \\n\\n RICKEEN \\n\\n RICKEEN \\n\\n \\n\\n Rickeen was again possessed by a spasm of industry: the chips flew out, the tall young ash cracked, and sank into the arms of its neighbours. There was a singular simplicity about the forestry of the establishment. When the bitter cry of the cook went forth for wood wherewith to cook the impending meal, Rickeen prayed that the divil might roast and baste all the women in Ireland, and cut down a convenient young tree. By this means the plantations were lightly thinned at the ends nearest the house, and as a general thing the cook gave notice every three weeks, which prevented any unwholesome stagnation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But as for dogs,\" continued Rickeen, a little later, as he snicked off the greeny-grey branches, \"the grandest dog ever was in this counthry was Mullowny\u0027s. Ye couldn\u0027t know what kind of a breed was in him, but ye\u0027d have to like him, he was that spotted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Here a long-drawn yell came forth from the yard, resolving itself gradually into a statement to Rickeen that the Misthress wanted her keys, and himself was the last one she seen them with. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rickeen put down his hatchet in fateful silence. His dog, couched in a brake where the young bracken stems curled like bishops\u0027 croziers round her crafty snout, raised one yellow eyebrow out of what was apparently deep sleep, arose, and followed him with her wonted gravity. Her cold manner was the next thing to good breeding; in spite of a family tree exclusively composed of crosses, in spite of a coat suggestive of a badger skin that has been used as a door mat, there was that in her pale eyes and in the set smile at the corners of her mouth that discouraged familiarity, and induced other dogs to feign a sudden interest in their own affairs as she approached. To follow Rickeen she gnawed ropes, and swam lakes, and ate her way through doors, and Rickeen never to my knowledge addressed her, except with the command to drive in the cows. In her next incarnation she will probably be the ideal colonist\u0027s wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n I remained sitting on a stump in the silence, and thought of my first love, Bran. Through the tree stems I could see a grassy hill sloping to the lake side, where, at the age of nine, I grovelled one morning among the cowslips and mopped my soaking tears with my holland waggoner, and wished for death, because Bran had been drowned. Bran was a cur, half silky and gracious Gordon setter, half woolly vulgarian of the Irish cottage breed, and to us, his comrades, a hero, an object of passionate faith, and, as such, the victim of many well-meant but excruciating honours. He wore, with docile consciousness of his absurdity, ornamental harness of strangling complications, and with it drew at a foot pace a grocer\u0027s box, mounted on wheels, while we walked before and after with fixed bayonets and all the gravity befitting a guard of honour operating in shrubberies teeming with banditti. It was not till an attempt was made to put the new bull dog into double harness with him that Bran showed symptoms of resentment, and the battle that then raged in the tangle of the shoulder straps and traces placed him, if possible, higher in our respect. The matter was patched up with the bull dog, who, though instant in quarrel, was not without good feeling, and next morning, at an early hour, I saw his frightful face protruding from under the bedclothes of my brother\u0027s bed, framed in a poke bonnet of sheet, while two long tails, languidly waving in welcome, hung down over the valance like bell-ropes, and witnessed to the presence of Bran and of the young deerhound, Kilfane, hidden in the deepest heart of the bed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Perhaps Sunday was the day that Bran was most satiating to us. To go to church on the top of the family omnibus was at any time the summit of ambition; with Bran speeding easily in front, or slackening for a hurried exchange of ferocities with cabin acquaintances, the five miles (invariably driven in the teeth of a north-westerly wind) were all too short. Those inside, whose turn it would be to sit on top coming home, yearned with crooked necks through the side windows, and stimulated by glimpses of the hero, were enabled to struggle successfully with the hideous tendency of childhood to be sea-sick in covered vehicles. During church time Bran was immured in the lock-up at the police station, and many a wriggling half-hour\u0027s endurance of the sermon was gilded by expectancy of the moment when the sorrowful sighing of the prisoner would turn to ardent sniffing under the door of the lockup, and the hand of the sergeant would restore to us \"life\u0027s greatest possibility.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n One summer night, at about this time, as I lay in my bed, the spirits of prophecy and of poesy came upon me hand in hand, quite inexplicably. Bran was in his usual health, and, as I afterwards found, was at that very hour engaged in stealing mutton hash from the back hall: but it was decreed that I should compose an ode fatefully commemorating his violent death. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Bran, thou wert gentle and sweet,\" I began, without an effort, while Mattel\u0027s Valse swung and crashed its way up through two ceilings from the drawing-room, \\n\\n \\n\\n But now thou art past and gone, \\n\\n Like a wave on the ocean so fleet, \\n\\n And the deed of death was done. \\n\\n \\n\\n Even here inspiration did not flag. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Tis no use to wail or to weep. \\n\\n For oh, alas and alack! \\n\\n Thou\u0027st gone to that eternal sleep, \\n\\n From which none can bring thee back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n The magnificence of the close was almost stupefying to the author; even the second line of the verse had seemed full of a rending passion. I sank to sleep, aware that I had taken my place in literature. \\n\\n \\n\\n A year afterwards came the miserable tears among the cowslips, the first taste of the bitter core of sentiment, and the discovery that the prophetic ode did not express the position. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bran occupies the whole foreground of the history of pets, but there were many of a lesser sort. There was even another elegy, beginning: \\n\\n \\n\\n Stranger, with reverence draw near, \\n\\n A Linnet lies below. \\n\\n \\n\\n But birds were not our foible. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rabbits followed each other in bewildering succession, and travelled to their doom by the same track. We fed them with milk and water out of eggspoons, with daisies, and with clover, but the morning always came when the foundling lay stiff in its hay, its black eyes glazed, and the limp daisies untouched beside it. One notable exception is recorded, a young rabbit brought in with a broken leg, who out of pure contrariety and improbability lived for a year. It became precocious beyond belief, and sat all day observing life from the arm of its proprietor. At night it slept, or affected to sleep, in a box in her room, biding its time till the candle was put out. Under cover of darkness it would then stealthily come forth and would buck with precision from the floor on to the face of the sleeper, repeating the feat as often as repulsed, until a burrow in some corner of the bed was granted. (It is not out of place here to mention that its nails were cut with extreme care and regularity.) Its diet presented no difficulty, save in the matter of restriction. It partook of the family meals as they came: porridge, marmalade, bread and butter, meat; uncooked green vegetables were not so much as mentioned in its presence. It even, horrible to confess, frequently ate rabbit-pie, and cracked and crunched the bones of its relatives with cannibal glee. On these scandalous foods it throve, but remained dwarfish and uncanny. It had moods of suspicion and brooding, when it sat in the chimney of an empty room. Once, under the protection, no doubt, of the evil spirits with whom it was in league, it leaped from a window sill forty feet above the ground, alighted with a flop, and greeted those who rushed to pick up the corpse with a cold stare of inquiry as to what the excitement was about. It met its death by presuming in the open field upon the long-suffering of the dogs whom it terrorised in the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n Outside the inner circle of pets, and within the outer circle of the donkeys whom we partly loved, partly scorned, and daily martyrised, kids held a certain position of their own. They are not to be commended, being skittish, peevish, tactless and strong, but they were not without attraction. One of them, black and white, with oblique barley-sugar eyes, showed much inclination towards the profession of house dog, and learned many essentials of that trade; the doors that were worth waiting at, the perils and rich prizes of the kitchen passages, the moment to intrude, the moment to fly. An incident of its career can best be told in the words of a certain Bridget, a notable member of the long dynasty of Bridgets that passed processionally through the establishment en route for America. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Misthress was below in the hall and she heard one above on the top landin\u0027, walkin\u0027 as sthrong as a man. \u0027Bridget!\u0027 says she,\" (the voice of command was given with great elegance and hauteur), \"and what was in it but the young goat, and it commenced walkin\u0027 down the stairs. \u0027Come here, Bridget!\u0027 says the Misthress, and sure of course the goat said nothing, but goin\u0027 on always from step to step. \u0027Arrah musha! The divil go from ye,\u0027 says the Misthress, \u0027why don\u0027t ye spake? What sort of hoppin\u0027 is it ye have up there?\u0027\" (The elegance of the imitation here yielded to the narrator\u0027s sense of what was fitting.) \"Faith, the goat stood then, like it\u0027d be afraid. \u0027The Lord save us, it\u0027s the fairies!\u0027 says the Misthress, an\u0027 there wasn\u0027t one in the house but she called, and what did they get in it but the goat, an\u0027 it having a stocking half ate!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Not long afterwards (next day probably) the kid was sent back on an outside car to its native place, a region of bog and rock and scrub, where its lamentations for the schoolroom fire had ample scope. It was escorted to its Siberia by a large party from the schoolroom, filled with curiosity to see how it would be received in its family circle. The boy who was left to hold the horse became also impelled to see the meeting, with the result that the horse and car were found a little later on their backs in a bog ditch, which conclusion is not to this hour known to the authorities. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was in the winter that the Reign of Terror of the Monkeys began. The first of them, large and grey, wearing the name of Lizzie, and a red flannel coat, arrived in December, and it was humanely arranged that she should live close to the kitchen fire on the flour bin. It was also enacted that she was to be chained to the wall \"until she got to know people a little.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There are Northern stories, Eastern ones, too, I believe, of houses in which evil spirits having once gained entrance, remained in immutable possession. Thus it was with us. In a short time Lizzie got to know every one very thoroughly. She bit each visitor indiscriminately, and having analysed the samples, she arranged a sliding scale of likes and dislikes, on the negative principle. That is to say, she would tolerate A till B arrived, when she bit A. On C\u0027s appearance she bit both A and B, and so on up to Z. The master of the house was Z. (Herein she showed her infernal cunning.) Z was never bitten. The kitchenmaid, in whose control were the dainties that Lizzie\u0027s soul loved, was Y, i.e., she was only bitten on the arrival of the master. Lizzie\u0027s bad life had the sole merit of brevity. One of her customs was to strike a match, and having burnt the hair on her grimy, nervous little arm, to eat the frizzled remains. (Thus invalidating the vaunt that man is the only animal that cooks.) Having on several occasions nearly set the house on fire, matches were forbidden to her, but one fortunate day a new boxful somehow fell into her possession, and, varying her wonted practice, she ate off the heads of most of the matches. Therewith her spirit passed; but only temporarily. In less than a year she was with us again. This time in the guise of a small brown monkey, that went by the name of Jack. A clear proof of obsession by the spirit of Lizzie was afforded in the fact that precisely the same sliding scale of hatred was observed, culminating as before in the master of the house. Jack was in some particulars less repellent than his predecessor. He was smaller, and was given to fits, which gave a hope that his life might not long be spared. By this time the flour-bin from long camping would have supplied the germs of enteric to an entire army corps. (I hasten to say that, being in Ireland, it was never used as a flour-bin having been thus temporarily styled as a concession to convention during the brief reign of an English cook who had long before fled to her native land.) Between the flour-bin and the wall Jack\u0027s fits usually took place, and it was the wont of the tender-hearted kitchenmaid (known to this day among her fellows as \"Mary-the-Monkey.\" The suffix \"the Monkey\" being a distinguishing mark; as \"Philippe-le-Bel,\" \"Robert-the-Lion\") to unchain him after one of these seizures and to sit before the fire with him on her lap. No experience seemed to teach her that his first act on recovery was to bite her suddenly and then escape. The alarm was spread in precisely the same manner on each successive occasion. First a shrill and piercing scream from \"Mary-the-Monkey,\" usually coupled with an appeal to her God. Then an answering yell from the next victim in the pantry. Then a shouting, and an earthquake slamming of doors through the house as its occupants one and all sped to safety. Finally the voice of the master assuring the invisible household that all was well, and that the monkey would never bite any one if they did not show that they were afraid of him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack died in a fit, and was mourned only by the master and the faithful kitchenmaid. Yet had he and his fellow had any desire for social success it would have been easy for them to have achieved it in a family so inured to pets as ours. \\n\\n \\n\\n But monkeys are worse than tactless. They understand their own hideousness and unpopularity, yet will not make a step towards amiability. A little leaning to the pathetic would have made us adore them, but they prefer to remain malevolent, remote, uttering coarse, mysterious grunts and screeches, out of hearts full of cold devilry. It is in keeping with their vulgarity that they should thrust their way into an assemblage of pets; an insult even to the kid and the rabbit, an outrage to the memory of Bran. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2038/58002.html","bookId":613,"book":{"id":613,"title":"Some Irish Yesterdays","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š Twelfth Day was accordingly added to Miss Gerraghty\u0027s list of Bath Holidaysthat is to say, the list allotted to Miss Gerraghty\u0027s visitors.
