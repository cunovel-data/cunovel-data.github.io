{"id":88835,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"I\u0027msorry. Was I interrupting something?\" he said, Maggie had to struggle not to draw in her breath sharply.\n It was always a little bit of a shock seeing him. And even in a room with Hunter Redfern and thepale and dazzling Sylvia, he stood out. Like a coldwind blowing through the door, he seemed to bringcoiled energy in with him, to slap everyone awakewith the chilly smell of snow.\n And of course he was gorgeous, too.\n And not awed by Hunter, Maggie thought. Hefaced his greatgrandfather with those fearless yellow eyes level, and a measuring look on his fineboned face.\n \"Nothing at all,\" Hunter Redfern said amiably.\"We were waiting for you. And planningthecelebrations.\"\n \"Celebrations?\"\n \"To honor our agreement. I\u0027m so pleased that we\u0027ve come to an understanding at last. Aren\u0027tyou?\"\n \"Of course,\" Delos said, pulling off his gloveswithout any change in expression. \"When we docome to an understanding, I\u0027ll be very pleased.\"\n Maggie had to bite her lip on a snicker. At thatmoment, looking at Hunter\u0027s facile smile and Sylvia\u0027s pinned-on simper, she had never liked Delos\u0027sdour, cold grimness better.\n Idiot, she told herself. When did you ever like itat all? The guy\u0027s an icicle.\n But there was something clean and sharp-edgedabout his iciness, and she couldn\u0027t help admiring the way he faced Hunter. There was a little aching knot in her chest as she watched himstandingthere, tense and elegant, with his dark hair tousled from riding.\n Which wasn\u0027t to say she wasn\u0027t scared. That auraof power Delos carried along with him was veryreal. He had sensed her before, even with Aradiablockingthe signs of her lifeforce. And now here he was, maybe twelve feet away, with only a pieceof linen between them.\n There was nothing Maggie could do but sit asstillas possible.\n \"Sylvia has taken the liberty of beginning thepreparations,\" Hunter said. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind.I think we can work out any little details that areleft before tomorrow, don\u0027t you?\"\n Suddenly Delos looked tired. He tossed his gloveson the bed and nodded, conceding a point. \"Yes.\"\n \"Essentially,\" Hunter Redfern said,\"we are agreed.\n This time Delos just nodded without speaking.\n \"I can\u0027t wait to show you off to the world outside,\" Hunter said, and this time Maggie thought the note of pride and eagerness in his voice was sincere. \"My great-grandson. And to think that ayear ago I didn\u0027t know of your existence.\" Hecrossed to slap Delos on the back. It was a gestureso much like the old king\u0027s that Maggie\u0027s eyeswidened.\n \"I\u0027m going to make some preparations of myown,\" he said. \"I think the last hunt before youleave should be special, don\u0027t you?\"\n He was smilingashe left.\n Delos stared moodily at the fur coverlet.\n \"Well,\" Sylvia said, sounding almost chirpy.\"How\u0027s the arm?\"\n Delos glanced down at it. He was still wearingthe complicated brace thing Maggie had seen him in yesterday.\n \"It\u0027s allriot.\"\n \"Hurts?\"\n \"A little.\"\n Sylvia sighed and shook her head. \"That\u0027s because you used it for practice. I did warn you,you know.\"\n \"Can you make it better or not?\" Delos saidbrusquely.\n Sylvia was already opening the basket. \"I toldyou, it\u0027ll take time. But it should improve with each treatment as longas you don\u0027t use it.\"\n She was fiddling with the brace, doing thingsthat Maggie couldn\u0027t see. And Maggie\u0027s heart wasbeating hard with anger and an unreasonableprotectiveness.\n I can\u0027t let her do that to Delosbut how can istop her? There\u0027s no way. If she sees me, it\u0027s allover... .\n \"There,\" Sylvia said. \"That should hold you fora while.\"\n Maggie ground her teeth.\n But at least maybe she\u0027ll go now, she thought. Itfeels like about a century I\u0027ve been sitting in herelistening to her. And this stool isn\u0027t getting anymore comfortable.\n \"Now,\" Sylvia said briskly, tidying. \"Just let meput your gloves away-\"\n Oh, no,Maggie thought, horrified. On the shelf beside her was a pile of gloves.\n \"No,\"Delos said, so quickly it was almost anecho. \"I need them.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be silly. You\u0027re not going out again-\"\n \"I\u0027ll take them.\" Delos had wonderful reflexes. Heput himself between Sylvia and the wardrobe, andan instant later he was holding on to the gloves,almost tugging them from her hands.\n Sylvia looked up at him wonderingly for a longmoment. Maggie could see her face, the creamy skin delicately flushed, and her eyes, the color of\n r-drenched violets. She could see the shimmerof her pale blondhairas Sylvia shook her head slightly.\n Delos stared down at her implacably.\n Then Sylvia shrugged her ft-agile shoulders andletgo of the gloves.\n \"I\u0027ll go see to the feast,\" she said lightly andsmiled. She picked up her basket and moved gracefully to the door.\n Delos watched her go.\n Maggiesimply sat, speechless and paralyzed.When Delos followed Sylvia and closed the door firmly behind her, she made herself get slowly offthe stool. She backed away from the curtainsslightly, but she could still see a strip of thebedroom.\n Delos walked unerringly straight to the wardrobe.\"You can come out now,\" he said, his voice flatand hard.\n Maggie shut her eyes.\n Great. Well, I should have known.\n But he hadn\u0027t let Sylvia come in and discoverher, and he hadn\u0027t simply turned her over to his guards. Those were very good signs, she told herself stoutly. In fact, maybe she wasn\u0027t going to haveto persuade him of anything at all; maybe he wasalready going to be reasonable.\n \"Or do I have to come in?\" Delos said dangerously.\n Or maybe not, Maggie thought.\n She felt a sudden idiotic desire to get the dust out of her hair. She shook her head a few times, brushing at it, then gave up.\n Terribly conscious of her smudged face and slaveclothing, she parted the linen hangings andwalked out.\n \"I warned you,\" Delos said.\n He was facing her squarely, his jaw set and hismouth as grimas she had ever seen it. His eyeswere hooded, a dull and eerie gold in the shadows.He looked every inch the dark and mysterious vam pire prince.\n And here I am, Maggie thought. Looking like...well, like vermin, I bet. Like something fished outof the gutter. Not much of a representative forhumanity.\n She had never cared about clothes or hairstylesor things like that, but just now she wished thatshe could at least look presentable. Since the fateof the world might just depend on her.\n Even so, there was something in the air betweenDelos and herself. A sort of quivering aliveness that quickened the blood in Maggie\u0027s veins. That stirredsomething in her chest, and started her heartpounding with an odd mixture of fear and hope.\n She faced Delos just assquarelyashe was facing her.\n \"I know some things that I think you need toknow,\" she said quietly.\n He ignored that. \"I told you what would happenif you came here. I told you I wouldn\u0027t protectyou again.\"\n \"I remember. But you didprotect me again. AndI thank you-but I really think I\u0027d better tell youwhat\u0027s going on. Sylvia is the suspicious type, andif she\u0027s gone to Hunter Redfern to say that youdon\u0027t want people looking in your closet-\"\n \"Don\u0027t you understand?\"he said with such sudden violence that Maggie\u0027s throat closed, chokingoff her words. She stared at him. \"You\u0027re so closeto dying, but you don\u0027t seem to care. Are you toostupid to grasp it, or do you just have a deathwish?\"\n The thumping in Maggie\u0027s chest now was definitelyfear.\n \"I do understand,\" she began slowly, when shecould get her voice to work.\n \"No, you don\u0027t, \"he said. `But I\u0027ll make you.\"\n All at once his eyes were blazing. Not just theirnormal brilliant yellow, but a dazzling and unnatural gold that seemed to hold its own light.\n Even though Maggie had seen it before, it wasstill a shock to watch his features change. His face going paler, even more beautiful and clearly defined, chiseled in ice. His pupils widening like a predator\u0027s, holding a darkness that a human coulddrown in. And that proud and willful mouth twist ing in anger.\n It all happened in a second or so. And then hewas advancing on her, with dark fire in his eyes,and his lips pulling back from his teeth.\n Maggie stared at the fangs, helplessly horrifiedall over again. They were even sharper than she remembered them looking. They indented hislower lip on either side, even with his mouth partly .open. And, yes, they were definitely scary.\n \"This is what I am,\" Delos said, speaking easily around the fangs. \"A hunting animal. Part of a world of darkness that you couldn\u0027t survive for aminute in. I\u0027ve told you over and over to stay awayfrom it, but you won\u0027t listen. You turn up in my own castle, and you just won\u0027t believe your danger.So now I\u0027m going to show you.\"\n Maggie took a step backward. She wasn\u0027t in agood position; the wall was behind her and thehuge bed was on her left. Delos was between her and the door. And she had already seen how fasthis reflexes were.\n Her legs felt unsteady; her pulse was beating erratically. Her breath was coming fast.\n He doesn\u0027t really mean ithe won\u0027t really do it.\n He isn\u0027t serious....\n But for all her mind\u0027s desperate chanting, panicwas beginning to riot inside her. The instincts of forgotten ancestors, long buried, were surfacing.Some ancient part of her remembered being chased by hunting animals, being prey.\n She backed up until she came in contact with the tapestry-hung wall behind her. And then therewas nowhere else to go.\n \"Now,\" Delos said and closed the distance between them with the grace of a tiger.\n He was right in front of her. Maggie couldn\u0027t helplooking up at him, looking directly into that alienand beautiful face. She could smell a scent like autumn leaves and fresh snow, but she could feel theheat from his body.\n He\u0027s nothing dead or undead, some very distantpart of her mind thought. He\u0027s ruthless, he\u0027s beenraised to be a weapon, but he\u0027s definitely alivemaybe the most alive thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\n When he moved, there was nowhere she couldgo to avoid him. His hands closed on her shoulderslike implacable bands of steel. And then he waspulling her forward, not roughly but not gently either, pulling her until her body rested lightlyagainst his. And he was looking down at her withgolden eyes that burned like twin flames.\n Looking at my throat, Maggie thought. She couldfeel the pulse beating there, and with her chin tiltedup to look at him and her upper body arched away from him, she knew he could see it. His eyes werefixed on it with a different kind of hunger than shehad ever seen in a human face.\n For just one instant the panic overwhelmed her,flooding up blackly to engulf everything else. Shecouldn\u0027t think; she was nothing but a terrified massof instinct, and all she wanted to do was to run,toget away.\n Then, slowly at first, the panic receded. It simplypoured off her, draining away. She feltasif she were rising from deep water into air clear ascrystal.\n She looked straight into the golden eyes aboveher and said, \"Go ahead.\"\n She had the pleasure of seeing the golden eyeslook startled. \"What?\"\n \"Go ahead,\" Maggie said distinctly. \"It doesn\u0027tmatter. You\u0027re stronger than me; we both knowthat. But whatever you do, you can\u0027t make me yourprey. You don\u0027t have that power. You can\u0027t control me.\"\n Delos hissed in fury, a reptilian sound. \"You are \".\n \"You wanted me scared; I\u0027m scared. But, then, Iwas scared before. And it doesn\u0027t matter. There\u0027s something more important than me at stake here.Prove whatever you\u0027ve got to prove and then I\u0027ll tell you about it.\n \"So completely stupid,\" Delos raged. But Maggiehad the odd feeling that his anger was more against himself than her. \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027ll hurt you,\"he said.\n \"You\u0027re wrong there.\"\n \"I willhurt you. I\u0027ll show you-\"\n \"You can kill me,\" Maggie said clearly. \"But that\u0027sall you can do. I told you, you can\u0027t control me. And you cant change what\u0027s between us.\"\n He was very, very angry now. The fathomless pupils of his eyes were like black holes, and Maggie suddenly remembered that he wasn\u0027t just a vampire, or just a weapon, but some doomsday creature with powers meant for the end of the world.He hovered over her with his fangs showing.\n \"I willhurt you,\" he said. \"Watch me hurt you.\"He bent to her angrily, and she could see his intent in his eyes. He meant to frighten and disillusion ...\n ... and he kissed her mouth like raindrops falling on cool water.\n Maggie clung to him desperately and kissed back.\n Where they touched they dissolved into each other.Then she felt him tremble in her arms and they were both lost.\n It was like the first time when their minds had joined. Maggie felt a pulsing thrill that enveloped her entire body. She could feel the pure line ofcommunication open between them, she could feelherself lifted into that wonderful still place whereonly the two of them existed and nothing else mattered.\n Dimly, she knew that her physical self was fallingforward, that they were both falling, still clasped in each other\u0027s arms. But in the hushed place of crystalline beauty where she really was, they werefacing each other in a white light.\n It was like being inside his mind again, but thistime he was there opposite her, gazing at her directly. He didn\u0027t look like a doomsday weapon anymore, or even like a vampire. His black-lashedgolden eyes were large, like a solemn child\u0027s. Therewas a terrible wistfulness in his face.\n He swallowed, and then she heard his mentalvoice. It was just the barest breath of sound. Idon\u0027twant this Yes, you do, she interrupted, indignant. The normal barriers that existed between two people had melted; she knew what he was feeling, and shedidn\u0027t like being lied to.\n -to end,he finished.\n Oh.\n Maggie\u0027s eyes filled with sudden hot tears.\n She did what was instinctive to her. She reachedout to him. And then they were embracing in their minds, justastheir physical bodies embraced, andthere was that feeling of invisible wings allaround them.\n Maggie could catch fragments of his thoughts,not just the surface ones, but things so deep shewasn\u0027t sure he even knew he was thinking them. So lonely ... always been lonely. Meant to be that way. Always alone ...\n No, you\u0027re not,she told him, trying to communicate it to the deepest part of him. Iwon\u0027t let you be alone. And wewere meant to be like this; can\u0027t you feel it?\n What she could feel was his powerful longing.But he couldn\u0027t be convinced all at once.\n She heard something like Destiny ... And shesaw images of his past. His father. His teachers.The nobles. Even the slaves who had heard theprophecies. They all believed he had only one purpose, and it had to do with the end of the world.\n You canchange your destiny, she said. Youdon\u0027t have to go along with it. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen with the world, but you don\u0027t have to be what they say. You have the power to fight them!\n For one heartbeat the image of his father seemed to loom closer, tall and terrible, a father seen through the eyes of childhood. Then the featuresblurred, changing just enough to become HunterRedfern with the same cruel and accusing light in his yellow eyes.\n And then the picture was swept away by a tidalwave of anger from Delos.\n I am not a weapon.\n I know that,Maggie told him.\n I can choose what I am from now on. I can choose what path to follow.\n Yes,Maggie said.\n Delos said simply, Ichoose to go with you.\n His anger was gone. Just briefly, she got theflicker of another image from him, as she had once before seeing herself through his eyes.\n He didn\u0027t see her as a slave girl with dusty hairand a smudged face and coarse sacking for clothes.He saw her as the girl with autumn-colored hairand endlessly deep sorrel eyes-the kind of eyesthat never wavered, but looked straight into his soul. He saw her as warm and real and vibrant,melting the black ice of his heart and setting him free.\n And then this image was gone, too, and they weresimply holding on to each other, lapped in peace.\n They stayed like that for a while, their spiritsflowing in and out of each other. Delos didn\u0027t seeminclined to move.\n And Maggie wanted it to last, too. She wanted tostay here for a long time, exploring all the deepestand most secret places of the mind that was nowopen to her. To touch him in ways he\u0027d never beentouched before, this person who, beyond all logic,was the other half of her. Who belonged to her.Who was her soulmate.\n But there was something nagging at her consciousness. She couldn\u0027t ignore it, and when shefinally allowed herself to look at it, she remembered everything.\n And she was swept with a wave of alarm sostrong it snapped her right out of Delos\u0027s mind.\n She could feel the shock of separation reverberate in him as she sat up, aware of her own bodyagain. They were still linked enough that ithurther just as it hurt him. But she was too frightenedto care.\n \"Delos,\" she said urgently. \"We\u0027ve got to do something. There\u0027s going to be trouble.\"\n He blinked at her,asif he were coming fromvery far away. \"It will be all right,\" he said.\n \"No. It won\u0027t. You don\u0027t understand.\"\n He sighed, very nearly his old exasperated snort.\"If it\u0027s Hunter Redfern you\u0027re worried about-\"\n \"It\u0027s him-and Sylvia. Delos, I heard them talkingwhen I was in the wardrobe. You don\u0027t know what they\u0027ve got planned.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter what they\u0027ve got planned. I cantake care of them.\" He straightened a little, looked down at his left arm.\n \"No, you can\u0027t,\"Maggie said fiercely. \"And that\u0027sthe problem. Sylvia put a spell on you, a bindingspell, she called it. You can\u0027t use your power.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-black-dawn-night-world-8/page-16.html","bookId":2081,"book":{"id":2081,"title":"Night World : Black Dawn (Night World #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Black Dawn (Night World Book 8) \n Maggie Neely is a short, spunky sixteen-year-old with auburn hair and an iron will.
