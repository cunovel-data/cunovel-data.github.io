{"id":88830,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"The bushes stirred again. Maggie\u0027s searching fingers found only acorns and licorice fern, so she made a fist instead, sliding out from underneath Cady and holding herself ready.\n A form emerged from the underbrush. Maggiestared so hard she saw gray dots but she couldn\u0027ttell anything about it.\n There was a long, tense moment, and then a voice came to her.\n \"I told you you\u0027d never make it.\"\n Maggie almost fainted with relief.\n At the same moment the moon came out frombehind a cloud. It shone down into the clearingand over the slender figure standing with a hand on one hip. The pale silvery light turned red hairalmost black, but the angular face and narrowed skeptical eyes were unmistakable. Not to mention the sour expression.\n Maggieletout along, shuddering breath. \"Jeanne!\"\n \"You didn\u0027t get very far, did you? The road\u0027s justover there. What happened? Did she drop deadon you?\"\n It wasamazinghow good that irritable, acerbicvoice sounded to Maggie. She laughed shakily. \"No, Cady\u0027s not dead. Bern\u0027s dead-you know, the bigslave trader guy. But - \"\n \"You\u0027re joking.\" Jeanne\u0027s voice sharpened with respect and she moved forward. `\"You killed hunt\u0027\n \"No. It waslook, I\u0027ll explain later. First, can youhelp me get her to somewhere more protected? It\u0027s really getting freezing out here, and she\u0027s completely out.\"\n Jeanne leaned down, looking at Arcadia. \"I toldyou before I wasn\u0027t going to help you if you gotin trouble.\"\n \"I know,\" Maggie said. \"Can you sort of pick herup from that side? If we both get an arm under her shouldersshemight be able to walk a little.\" .\n `Bull,\" Jeanne said shortly. \"We\u0027d better chaircarry her. Link hands and we can get her up.\"\n Maggie clasped a cold, slender hand with calluses and a surprisingly firm grip. She heavedweight, and then they were carrying the unconscious girl.\n \"You\u0027re strong,\" she grunted.\n \"Yeah, well, that\u0027s one of the side benefits ofbeing a slave. The road\u0027s this way.\"\n It was awkward, slow work, but Maggie wasstrong, too, and Jeanne seemed to be able to guide them around the worst of the underbrush. And it was so good just to be with another human being who was healthy and clear headed and didn\u0027t want to kill her, that Maggie felt almost lighthearted.\n \"What aboutP.J.? Is she okay?\"\n \"She\u0027s fine. She\u0027s in a place I know-it\u0027s notmuch, but it\u0027s shelter. That\u0027s where we\u0027re going.\"\n \"You took care of her,\" Maggie said. She shook her head in the darkness and laughed.\n \"What are you snickering about?\" Jeanne paused and they spent a few minutes maneuvering arounda fallen log covered with spongy moss.\n \"Nothing,\" Maggie said. \"It\u0027s justyou\u0027re prettynice, aren\u0027t you? Underneath.\"\n \"I look out for myself first. That\u0027s the rule aroundhere. And don\u0027t you forget it,\" Jeanne said in a threatening mutter. Then she cursed as her foot sank into a swampy bit of ground.\n \"Okay,\" Maggie said. But she could still feel awry and wondering smile tugging up the corner ofher mouth.\n Neither of them had much breath for talkingafter that. Maggie was in a sort of daze of tirednessthat wasn\u0027t completely unpleasant. Her mindwandered.\n Delos...she had never met anyone so confus ing. Her entire body reacted just at the thought ofhim, with frustration and anger and a longing that she didn\u0027t understand. It was a physical pang.\n But then everything was so confusing. Things had\n happened so fast since last night that she\u0027d neverhad time to get her mental balance. Delos and the incredible thing that had happened between themwas only one part of the whole mess.\n He said he\u0027d killed Miles....\n But that couldn\u0027t be true. Miles couldn\u0027t be dead.And Delos wasn\u0027t capable of anything like that....Was he?\n She found that she didn\u0027t want to think aboutthat. It was like a huge dark cloud that she didn\u0027twant to enter.\n Wherever Jeanne was taking her, it was a long,cold trek. And a painful one. After about fifteenminutes Maggie\u0027s arms began to feelasif they werebeing pulled out of the sockets, and a hot spot of pain flared at the back of her neck. Her sweat wasclammy running down her back and her feetwere numb.\n But she wouldn\u0027t give up, and Jeanne didn\u0027t either. Somehow they kept going. They had traveledfor maybe about forty-five minutes, with breaks,when Jeanne said, \"Here it is.\"\n A clearing opened in front of them, and moonlight shone on a crude little shack made of weathered wood. It leaned dangerously to one side andseveral boards were missing, but it had a ceilingand walls. It was shelter. To Maggie, it looked beautiful.\n \"Runaway slaves built it,\" Jeanne said breathlesslyas they took the last few steps to the cabin. \"The Night People hunted them down, of course, but they didn\u0027t find this place. All the slaves at the castle know about it.\" Then she called in a slightlylouder tone, \"It\u0027s me! Open the door!\" A long pause, and then there was the sound of awooden bolt sliding and the door opened. Maggiecould see the pale blob of a small face. P.J. Penob scot, with her red plaid baseballcap still on backwardand herslightbodytense,wasblinkingsleepy, frightened eyes.\n Then she focused and her face changed.\"Maggie! You\u0027re okay!\" She flung herself at Maggie like a small javelin.\n \"Ow-hey!\" Maggie swayed and Cady\u0027s limp bodydipped perilously.\n \"I\u0027m glad to see you, too,\" Maggie said. To herown surprise, she found herself blinking back tears.\"But I\u0027ve got to put this girl down or I\u0027m going todrop her.\"\n \"Back here,\" Jeanne said. The back of the cabinwas piled with straw. She and Maggie eased Arcadia down onto it and then P.J. hugged Maggie again.\n \"You got us out. We got away,\" P.J. said, hersharp little chin digging into Maggie\u0027s shoulder.\n Maggie squeezed her. \"Wellwe all got us out,and Jeanne helped get you away. But I\u0027m glad everybody made it.\"\n \"Is she...all right?\" P.J. pulled back and lookeddown at Arcadia.\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Cady\u0027s forehead felt hot underMaggie\u0027s hand, and her breathing was regular butwith a rough, wheezy undertone Maggie didn\u0027tlike.\n \"Here\u0027s a cover,\" Jeanne said, dragging up a pieceof heavy, incredibly coarse material. It seemed asbig as a sail and so rigid it hardly sagged or folded.\"If we all get under it, we can keep warm.\"\n They put Cady in the middle, Maggie and P.J. onone side of her and Jeanne on the other. The cover was more than big enough to spread over them.\n And the hay smelled nice. It was prickly, butMaggie\u0027s long sleeves and jeans protected her. There was a strange comfort in P.J.\u0027s slight bodycuddled up next to herlike a kitten, Maggiethought. And it was so blessedly good to not bemoving, to not be carrying anyone, but just to sit still and relax her sore muscles.\n \"There was a little food stashed here,\" Jeannesaid, digging under the hay and pulling out a smallpacket.\n \"Dried meat strips and oatcakes with salalberries. We\u0027d better save some for tomorrow,though.\"\n Maggie tore into the dried meat hungrily. Itdidn\u0027t taste like beef jerky; it was tougher and gam ier, but right at the moment it seemed delicious.She tried to get Cady to eat some, but it was nouse. Cady just turned her head away.\n She and Jeanne and P.J. finished the meal offwith a drink of water, and then they lay back onthe bed of hay.\n Maggie felt almost happy. The gnawing in her stomach was gone, her muscles were loosening up,and she could feel a warm heavinesssettlingoverher.\n \"You were going... to tell me about Bern ...\"Jeanne said from the other side of Cady. The wordstrailed off into a giant yawn.\n \"Yeah.\" Maggie\u0027s brain was fuzzy and her eyeswouldn\u0027t stay open. \"Tomorrow ...\"\n And then, lying on a pile of hay in a tiny shack ina strange kingdom, with three girls who had been strangers to her before this afternoon and who nowseemed a little like sisters, she was fast asleep.\n Maggie woke up with her nose cold and her feettoo hot. Pale light was coming in all the cracks inthe boards of the cabin. For one instant she stared at the rough weathered-silver boards and the hayon the floor and wondered where she was. Thenshe remembered everything.\n \"Cady.\" She sat up and looked at the girl beside her.\n Cady didn\u0027t look well. Her face had the waxyinner glow of somebody with a fever, and there were little tendrils of dark hair curled damply onher forehead. But at Maggie\u0027s voice her eyelashes fluttered, then her eyes opened.\n \"Maggie?\"\n \"How are you feeling? Want some water?\" Shehelped Cady drink from the leather bag.\n \"I\u0027m all right. Thanks to you, I think. Youbrought me here, didn\u0027t you?\" Cady\u0027s face turnedas if she were looking around the room with herwide, unfocused eyes. She spoke in short sentences, as if she were conserving her strength, but hervoice was more gentle than weak. \"And Jeanne, too.Thank you both.\"\n She must have heard us talkinglast night, Maggie thought. Jeanne was sitting up, straw in her red hair, her green eyes narrow and alert instantly. P.J.was stirring and making grumpy noises.\n \"Morning,\" Maggie said. \"Is everybody okay?\u0027\n \"Yeah,\" P.J. said in a small, husky voice. Therewas a loud rumble from her stomach. \"I guess I\u0027mstill a little hungry,\" she admitted.\n \"There\u0027re a couple oatcakes left,\" Jeanne said.\"And one strip of meat. We might as well finishit off.\"\n They made Cady eat the meat, although she triedto refuse it. Then they divided the oatcakes solemnly into four parts and ate them, chewing dog gedly on dry, flaky mouthfuls.\n \"We\u0027re going to need more water, too,\" Maggiesaid, after they\u0027d each had a drink. The leather bagwas almost empty. \"But I think the first thing is tofigure out what we\u0027re going to do now. What our plan is.\"\n \"The first thing,\" Jeanne said, \"is to tell us whathappened to Bern.\"\n \"Oh.\"Maggie blinked, but she could see whyJeanne would want to know. \"Well, he\u0027s definitely dead.\" She sketched in what had happened aftershe and Cady had started running through thewoods. How Gavin and Bern had chased them andhad finally driven them into a corner on the boulder pile.How Bern hadclimbedup andchanged...\n \"He was a shapeshifter, you know,\" she said.\n Jeanne nodded, unsurprised. \"Bern means bear.They usually have names that mean what they are.But you\u0027re saying you tried to fight thatguy off with a stick? You\u0027re dumber than I thought.\" Still,her green eyes were gleaming with something likewry admiration, and P.J. was listening with awe.\n \"And then-there was this lightning,\" Maggiesaid. \"And it killed Bern and Gavin ran away.\" Sherealized, even asshe said it, that she didn\u0027t wantto tell everything that had happened with Delos.She didn\u0027t think Jeanne would understand. So she left out the way their minds had linked when theytouched, and the way she\u0027d seen his memories-and the fact that she\u0027d dreamed about him beforeever coming to this valley.\n \"Then I filled the water bag and we heard Sylviacoming and he went out to make sure she didn\u0027tfind me or Cady,\" she finished. She realized thatthey were all staring at her. Cady\u0027s facewasthoughtful and serene as always, P.J. was scaredbut interested in the story-but Jeanne was rivetedwith disbelief and horror.\n \"You\u0027re saying Prince Delossaved your life? Withthe blue fire? You\u0027re saying he didn\u0027t turn you overto the hunting party?\" She said it as if she were talking about Dracula.\n \"It\u0027s the truth.\" Good thing I didn\u0027t tell her aboutthe kiss, Maggie thought.\n \"It\u0027s impossible. Delos hates everybody. He\u0027s themost dangerous of all of them.\"\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s what he kept telling me.\" Maggieshook her head. The way Jeanne was looking at hermade her uncomfortable,as if she were defendingsomeone unredeemably evil. \"He also said at one point that he killed my brother,\" she said slowly.\"But I didn\u0027t know whether to believeit....\"\n \"Believe it.\" Jeanne\u0027s nostrils were flared and herlip curledasif she were looking at something disgusting.\n \"He\u0027s the head of this whole place and everything that goes on here. There\u0027s nothing hewouldn\u0027t do. I can\u0027t believe he let you go.\" She considered for a moment, then said grimly, \"Unless he\u0027s got something special in mind. Letting you go and then hunting you down later. It\u0027s the kind ofthing he\u0027d enjoy.\"\n Maggie had a strange feeling of void in her stomach that had nothing to do with hunger. She triedto speak calmly. \"I don\u0027t think so. I think-he justdidn\u0027t care if I got away.\"\n \"You\u0027re fooling yourself. You don\u0027t understandabout these people because you haven\u0027t been here. None of youhave been here.\" Jeanne looked at P.J.,who was watching with wide blue \u0027eyes, and atCady, who was listening silently, her head slightlybowed. \"The Night People are monsters.And theones here in the Dark Kingdom are the worst of all. Some of them have been alive for hundreds of years-some of them were here when Delos\u0027sgrandfather founded the place. They\u0027ve been holedup in this valley all that time ... and allthey do ishunt.It\u0027s their only sport. It\u0027s all they care about. It\u0027s all they do.\"\n Maggie\u0027s skin was prickling. Part of her didn\u0027twant to pursue this subject any further. But she had to know.\n \"Last night I noticed something weird,\" she said.\"I was standing outside and listening, but I couldn\u0027thear any animal sounds anywhere. None at all.\"\n \"They\u0027ve wiped them out. Alltheanimalsin the wild are gone.\"\n P.J.\u0027s thin little hand clutched at Maggie\u0027s armnervously. \u0027But then what do they hunt?\"\n \"Animals they breed and release. I\u0027ve been a slavehere for three years, and at first I only saw them breeding local animaLs-cougars and black bears\n wolverines and stuff. But in the last couple ofyears they\u0027ve started bringing in exotics. Leopardstigers and things.\"\n Maggie let out her breath and patted P.J.\u0027s hand.`But not humans.\"\n \"Don\u0027t make me laugh. Of course humans-butonly when they can get an excuse. The laws say the vampires can\u0027t hunt slaves to death because they\u0027retoo precious-pretty soon the food supply wouldbe gone. But if slaves get loose, they at least get to hunt them down and bring them back to the castle. And if a slave has to be executed, they do a death hunt.\"\n \"I see.\" The void in Maggie\u0027s stomach had become a yawning chasm. \"But-2\u0027\n \"If he let you go, it was so he could come backand hunt you,\" Jeanne said flatly. \"I\u0027m telling you,he\u0027s bad. It was three years ago that the old kingdied and Delos took over, okay? And it was threeyears ago that they started bringing new slaves in.Not just grabbing people off the mountain if theygot too close, but actuallygoing down and kidnapping girls off the streets. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.That\u0027swhy P.J.\u0027s here.\"\n Beside Maggie, P.J. shivered. Maggie put an armaround her and felt the slight body shaking againsthers. She gulped, her other hand clenching into afist. \"Hey, kiddo. You\u0027ve been really brave so far, sojust hang on, okay? Things are going to work out.\"\n She could feel Jeanne\u0027s sarcastic eyes on herfrom beyond Cady, daring her to explain exactly howthings were going to work out. She ignoredthem.\n \"Was it the same for you, Cady?\" she asked. Shewas glad to get off the subject of Delos, and shewas remembering the strange thing Cady had saidlast night. I was coming here for a reason....\n \"No. They got me on the mountain.\" But the wayCady spoke alarmed Maggie. It was slowly and with obvious effort, the voice of someone who had touse all their strength just to concentrate.\n Maggie forgot all about Delos and the slave tradeand put a hand to Cady\u0027s forehead. \"Oh, God,\" she said. \"You\u0027re burning up. You\u0027re totally on fire.\"\n Cady blinked slowly. \"Yes-it\u0027s the poison,\" shesaid in a foggy voice. \"They injected me with something when they caught me-but I had a bad reaction to it. My system can\u0027t take it.\"\n Adrenaline flicked through Maggie. \"And you\u0027regetting worse.\" When Cady nodded reluctantly, shesaid,\n \"Right. Then there\u0027s no choice. We have to getto the castle because that\u0027s where the healingwomen are, right? If anybody can help, they can, right?\"\n \"Wait a minute,\" Jeanne said. \"We can\u0027t go downto the castle. We\u0027d be walking right into their arms.And we can\u0027t get out of the valley. I found the passbefore, but that was by accident. I couldn\u0027t find itagain\n \"I could,\" Maggie said. When Jeanne stared at her, she said, \"Never mind how. I just can. But going that way means climbing down a mountainon the other side and Cady can\u0027t make it. And I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll make it if we leave her alone hereand go look for help.\"\n Jeanne\u0027s narrow green eyes were on her again,and Maggie knew what they were saying. So we\u0027vegot to give up on her. It\u0027s the only thing thatmakessense. But Maggie bulldozed on in determination. \"Youcan take P.J. to thepass-I can tellyou howto get there-and Ill take Cady to the castle. How about that? If you can tell me how to get to it.\"\n \"Itstinks,\"Jeanne said flatly. \"Even if you make\n it to the castle with her hanging on you, you won\u0027tknow how to get in. And if you doget in, you\u0027ll be committing suicide-\"\n She broke off, and everyone started. For an instant Maggie didn\u0027t understand why-all she knewwas that she had a sudden feeling of alarm andalertness. Then she realized that Cady had turnedsuddenly toward the door. It was the quick, instinctive gesture of a cat who has heard something dangerous, and it triggered fear in the girls who werelearning to live by their own instincts.\n And now that Maggie sat frozen, she could hearit, too, faraway but distinct. The sound of peoplecalling, yelling back and forth. And another sound, one that she\u0027d only heard in movies, but that sherecognized instantly. Hounds baying.\n \"It\u0027s them,\" Jeanne whispered into the dead silence of the shack. \"I told you. They\u0027re hunting us.\"\n \"With dogs?\"Maggie said, shock tingling throughher body.\n \"It\u0027s all over,\" Jeanne said. \"We\u0027re dead.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-black-dawn-night-world-8/page-11.html","bookId":2081,"book":{"id":2081,"title":"Night World : Black Dawn (Night World #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Black Dawn (Night World Book 8) \n Maggie Neely is a short, spunky sixteen-year-old with auburn hair and an iron will.
