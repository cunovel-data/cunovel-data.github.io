{"id":98229,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u0027In my younger days I used to be keen on Castaneda. And I read in one of his books that awareness is the food of the Eagle. The way I understood it, the Eagle\u0027s some obscure thing they have instead of God. I\u0027m no coward, far from it. But that made me feel afraid . . . Anyway, I turned to Orthodoxy. Even though the situation was rather ambivalent. I was already a wolf then, it was three years since I\u0027d been accepted into the pack. We still had a pack in those days. Colonel Lebedenko was still alive . . .\u0027\\n\\n He gestured helplessly.\\n\\n \u0027Awareness is the food of the Eagle?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Alexander. \u0027That\u0027s what the magicians of ancient Yucatan believed.\u0027\\n\\n What a little boy he still is, really, I thought tenderly.\\n\\n \u0027Silly boy. It\u0027s not awareness that\u0027s the food of the Eagle. It\u0027s the Eagle that\u0027s the food of awareness.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which Eagle exactly?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Any. And the magicians of ancient Yucatan too, with all their business seminars, workshops, videodiscs and ageing Naguals. Every last one of them is the food of awareness. Including you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How\u0027s that?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n I took his cigar and blew out a cloud of smoke.\\n\\n \u0027You see that?\u0027\\n\\n He watched as it swirled and evolved.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Are you aware of it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A werewolf is like that cloud of smoke. He lives, changes his form, his colour and volume. Then he disappears. But when the smoke dissipates, nothing happens to awareness. Something else just appears in it instead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But where does awareness go after death?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t have to go anywhere,\u0027 I said. \u0027You\u0027re not going anywhere, are you? You\u0027re sitting there, you\u0027re smoking. And it\u0027s the same.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what about heaven and hell?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re smoke rings. Awareness doesn\u0027t go anywhere. On the contrary, anything that does go anywhere immediately becomes its food. Like that smoke there. Or like your thoughts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But whose awareness is it?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s the food of awareness as well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, you don\u0027t understand the question. Whose is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And that too,\u0027 I said patiently.\\n\\n \u0027But there has to be -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And that,\u0027 I interrupted.\\n\\n \u0027Then who . . .\u0027\\n\\n At this point he suddenly seemed to get it - he took his chin in his hand and stopped talking.\\n\\n It\u0027s really difficult trying to explain these things in abstract terms. You can get tangled up in the words: \u0027In perception there is neither subject nor object, but only the pure experience of the transcendent nature, and this experience is everything - both physical objects and mental constructs, which include the ideas of a perceived object and a perceiving subject . . .\u0027 After the first three words you can\u0027t tell what it\u0027s all about any more. But with an example it\u0027s easy - one good puff of smoke and that\u0027s it. So now he understood. Or almost understood.\\n\\n \u0027Then what do you reckon this is, all around us?\u0027 he asked, taking back his cigar. \u0027Is it like The Matrix?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Almost, but not quite.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what\u0027s the difference?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In The Matrix there\u0027s an objective reality - a warehouse outside town with the bodies of the people stacked in it. Otherwise the portfolio investors wouldn\u0027t have put up the money for the film, they\u0027re very strict about that sort of thing. But in fact everything\u0027s like in The Matrix, only without that warehouse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a dream, but there isn\u0027t anybody dreaming it. That is, they\u0027re part of the dream too. Some say the dream dreams itself. But strictly speaking there isn\u0027t any \"itself\".\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In The Matrix everybody was connected by wires to something real. But in actual fact everybody\u0027s connected to the same kind of pipedream as they are themselves. And since all the dreamers see more or less the same, this pipedream is also a joint dream, and that\u0027s why people call it real. The dream only lasts for as long as the connection continues. But once it stops, there\u0027s no hardware left behind for the court bailiffs to inventorize. Or any body for them to bury.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Now that\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong,\u0027 he said with a grin. \u0027More often than not, that\u0027s exactly what does happen.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know what they say - leave the virtuals to bury their virtuals. The buriers and the buried are only real in relation to each other.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How can that be possible?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Take a look around.\u0027\\n\\n He thought for a while without saying anything. Then he nodded sullenly.\\n\\n \u0027A pity you weren\u0027t around to explain that. And what good is it now . . . It\u0027s too late to change my life now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, you\u0027re really stuck, you poor sod,\u0027 I sighed. \u0027Why don\u0027t you try moving your assemblage point in the position of holy life?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you laughing at me?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Well laugh, Ginger, go on. It\u0027s stupid, I don\u0027t deny it. Do you believe in God yourself?\u0027\\n\\n I was really taken aback by that.\\n\\n \u0027Do you believe?\u0027 he repeated.\\n\\n \u0027Foxes respect the religion of Adonai,\u0027 I replied diplomatically.\\n\\n \u0027Respect isn\u0027t where it\u0027s at. Can you tell me if you believe or not?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Foxes have their own faith.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what do they believe in?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The super-werewolf.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The one Lord Cricket talked about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lord Cricket was way off beam. He didn\u0027t have a clue about the super-werewolf.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But who is the super-werewolf?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There are several levels of understanding. At the most primitive one, he is the messiah who will come and tell all the were-creatures what the score is. This interpretation has been influenced by human religion, and the central profane symbol corresponding to it was also taken from people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what is this central profane symbol?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027An inverted five-pointed star. The humans don\u0027t understand it correctly. They draw a goat\u0027s head into it with the horns at the top. They like to see the devil everywhere, except in the mirror and on TV.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what does this star really mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s the vulpine crucifix. Something like the St Andrew\u0027s Cross with a crossbar for the tail. Of course, we have no intention of crucifying anyone, we\u0027re not people. All this signifies a symbolic atonement for the sins of foxes, of which the most important is ignorance.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how is the super-werewolf going to atone for the sins of foxes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He will give foxes the Sacred Book of Werewolf.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What kind of book is that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The general belief is that it will reveal the central mystery of all were-creatures. Every were-creature who reads it will be able to comprehend this mystery five times.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what\u0027s this book going to be called?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Nobody does. They say its title will be a magical pentagrammaton, a spell that annihilates all obstacles. But all this is no more than legend. The concept of the super-werewolf has a true meaning that has nothing to do with all these fairy tales.\u0027\\n\\n I was expecting him to ask about this true meaning, but instead he asked about something else.\\n\\n \u0027What does that mean - you\u0027ll \"be able to comprehend this mystery five times\". Once you\u0027ve understood something, why do you need to understand it another four times? You\u0027re already in the know, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027On the contrary. In most cases, if you\u0027ve already comprehended something, you\u0027ll never be able to comprehend it again, precisely because you think that you know everything already. But in the truth there isn\u0027t anything that can be understood once and for all. Since we don\u0027t see it with our eyes but with our minds, we say \"I understand\". But when we think we\u0027ve understood it, we\u0027ve already lost it. In order to possess the truth, you have to see it constantly - or, in other words, comprehend it over and over again, second after second, continuously. And that\u0027s a very rare ability.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, \u0027I understand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll understand it in two days\u0027 time. You\u0027ll be left with the dead husks of words, and you\u0027ll think there\u0027s still something wrapped up in them. That\u0027s what all the humans think. They seriously believe that they possess spiritual treasures and sacred texts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what you\u0027re saying is that words can\u0027t reflect the truth?\u0027\\n\\n I shook my head in confirmation.\\n\\n \u0027Two times two is four,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s the truth, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not necessarily.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, for instance, you\u0027ve got two bollocks and two nostrils. Two times two. But I don\u0027t see any four in that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What if we add them up?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How are you going to add nostrils to bollocks? Leave that sort of thing to humans.\u0027\\n\\n He thought about it. Then he asked: \u0027And when\u0027s the superwerewolf supposed to come?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The super-werewolf comes every time you see the truth.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what is the truth?\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 he repeated.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \u0027Eh?\u0027\\n\\n I rolled my eyes up. That\u0027s a facial gesture that really suits me.\\n\\n \u0027I asked you a question, Ginger.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Surely it\u0027s clear enough? My silence is the answer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But can you answer in words? So that I could understand?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s nothing there to understand,\u0027 I replied. \u0027When you\u0027re asked the question \"what is truth?\" there\u0027s only one way you can answer it without lying. You must see the truth within yourself, on the inside. But on the outside you must keep silent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And do you see this truth within yourself?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n I said nothing.\\n\\n \u0027All right, I\u0027ll put it a different way. When you see this truth within yourself, what exactly do you see?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing? And that\u0027s the truth?\u0027\\n\\n I said nothing.\\n\\n \u0027If there\u0027s nothing there, then why do we talk about truth at all?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re confusing the cause and the effect. We don\u0027t talk about truth because there\u0027s something there. On the contrary, we think there must be something there because the word \"truth\" exists.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly. The word exists, doesn\u0027t it? Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just because. Forever wouldn\u0027t be long enough to untangle all the cunning tricks words play. You can think up an infinite number of questions and answers - you can put the words together this way and that way, and every time some kind of meaning will stick to them. It\u0027s pointless. That sparrow over there doesn\u0027t have any questions for anybody. But I don\u0027t think he\u0027s any further away from the truth than Lacan or Foucault.\u0027\\n\\n I thought he might not know who Lacan and Foucault were. Although they supposedly had that counter-brainwashing course . . . But in any case I knew I ought to express myself more simply.\\n\\n \u0027In short, it\u0027s all because of words that the humans are stuck up shit creek. And the were-creatures with them. Because even though we are were-creatures, we speak their language.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But words exist for a reason, don\u0027t they?\u0027 he said. \u0027If people really are stuck up shit creek, we need to understand why, don\u0027t we?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When you\u0027re up shit creek, there are two things you can do. First - you can try to understand why you\u0027re up there. Or second - you can get out of there. The mistake that individuals and entire nations make is to think these two actions are somehow interconnected. But they aren\u0027t. And getting out of shit creek is a lot easier than understanding why you\u0027re stuck up it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You only have to get out of shit creek once, and after that you can forget about it. But to understand why you\u0027re stuck up it takes a lifetime. Which you\u0027ll spend stuck up there.\u0027\\n\\n We sat in silence for a while, gazing into the darkness.\\n\\n Then he asked: \u0027But even so. What do people have language for, if it gives them nothing but grief?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In the first place, so they can lie. In the second place, so they can wound each other with the barbs of venomous words. In the third place, so they can discuss what doesn\u0027t exist.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what does exist as well?\u0027\\n\\n I raised one finger.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s this?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Why are you giving me the finger?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not giving you the finger, I\u0027m pointing. There\u0027s no need to discuss what does exist. It\u0027s right there in front of you anyway. It\u0027s enough just to point to it.\u0027\\n\\n We didn\u0027t talk any more that evening, but I knew the first seeds had fallen on fertile ground. All I could do now was wait for the next opportunity.\\n\\n In case anyone thinks our way of making love is a perversion (tailechery, he\u0027d called it eh? You couldn\u0027t forget that in a hurry) I advise them to take a closer look at what people do to each other. First they wash their bodies and remove the hairs from them, then they spray liquids on themselves to kill their natural smell (I remember Count Tolstoy was particularly outraged by that) - and all in order to make themselves fuckable for a short while. And after the act of love they immerse themselves once again in the humiliating details of personal hygiene.\\n\\n Even worse than that, people are ashamed of their own bodies or dissatisfied with them: men pump up their biceps, women go to any lengths to lose weight and they have silicone breast implants put in. The plastic surgeons have even invented an illness, \u0027micromastia\u0027 - that\u0027s when the breasts are smaller than a pair of watermelons. And they\u0027ve started elongating men\u0027s penises and selling special tablets so that they\u0027ll still work afterwards. If there were no market in illnesses, there wouldn\u0027t be any market in medicines - that\u0027s the Hippocratic secret that doctors swear a solemn oath never to reveal.\\n\\n Human amorous is an extremely unstable feeling. It can be killed by a few stupid words, a bad smell, sloppily applied make-up, a chance intestinal spasm, or absolutely anything at all. Moreover, this can happen instantaneously, and no human being has any control over it. And this impulse typically contains - to an even greater degree than everything else that is human - a bottomless absurdity, a tragicomic abyss, which the mind only finds so easy to bridge because it doesn\u0027t even see it.\\n\\n The best description I ever heard of this abyss was given by a certain red commander in autumn 1919 - after I fed him the magic mushrooms that I had collected right beside the wheels of his armoured train. He put it this way: \u0027Somehow I can\u0027t understand any more why it is that just because I like a girl\u0027s beautiful and soulful face I have to fuck her wet, hairy cunt!\u0027 It\u0027s put in a coarse, peasant fashion, but the essential point has been grasped precisely. And by the way, before he ran off forever into the rain-soaked expanse of autumn fields, he expressed another interesting thought: \u0027If you think about it, a woman\u0027s attractiveness has less to do with her hairstyle or the lighting than with my balls.\u0027\\n\\n But people still indulge in sex - although, of course, in recent years mostly through a little rubber sack, to prevent anything encroaching upon their solitude. This sport, which was dubious enough to begin with, has now become like a downhill slalom: the risk to your life is about the same, except that it\u0027s not the twists and turns in the piste that you have to watch, you have to make sure your ski-suit doesn\u0027t come off. I find anyone who indulges in this activity absurd in the role of a moralist, and it\u0027s not for him to judge what\u0027s perverted and what isn\u0027t.\\n\\n Were-creatures\u0027 attraction to each other is less dependent on impermanent external allure. But of course, it does play a part. I guessed that what had happened to Alexander would affect our intimate relations. But I didn\u0027t think the trauma would go so deep. Alexander was as caring with me as ever, but only within strict limits: it was as if a barbed-wire fence had been erected at the point where formerly his affection had spilled over into intimacy. He evidently thought that in his new form I didn\u0027t find him attractive. He was partly right - I couldn\u0027t say that this black dog aroused the same feelings in me as the mighty northern wolf, one glimpse of which was enough to take my breath away. The dog was very cute, it\u0027s true. But no more than that. It could count on my affection. But not my passion.\\n\\n Only that was simply not important. We had abandoned vulgar human-style sex when we realized how far we could be transported into a fairy-tale fantasy by our intertwined tails. And so his metamorphosis was no more serious an obstacle to our passion than, say, the black underwear that he started wearing instead of grey. But he didn\u0027t seem to understand this, imagining that I identified him with his physical receptacle. Or perhaps the sense of shock at what had happened and his irrational feeling of guilt were so intense that he had simply forbidden himself to think about pleasure - after all, men, with or without tails, are far more psychologically vulnerable than we are, for all their show of toughness.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t take the initiative. But not because I didn\u0027t find him attractive any more. It\u0027s always nice when the man takes the first step, and I instinctively followed that rule. Perhaps, I thought, he\u0027s feeling miserable, and he needs time to come round. But one day he asked a question that allowed me to guess where his problems lay.\\n\\n \u0027You were talking about that philosopher Berkeley,\u0027 he said. \u0027The guy who thought that everything only exists when it\u0027s perceived. \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I was,\u0027 I agreed.\\n\\n I really had tried to explain it to him, and I thought I\u0027d achieved a certain degree of success.\\n\\n \u0027So then sex and masturbation are the same thing?\u0027\\n\\n I was dumbfounded.\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If everything only exists by virtue of perception, then making love to a real girl is the same as imagining that girl.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not entirely. Berkeley said that objects exist in the perception of God. The idea of a beautiful girl is simply your idea. But a beautiful girl is God\u0027s idea.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Both of them are ideas. Why is it good to make love to God\u0027s idea, and bad to make love to your own idea?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And that\u0027s Kant\u0027s categorical imperative.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see you\u0027ve got all the bases covered,\u0027 he muttered, disgruntled, and walked off into the forest.\\n\\n After that conversation I realized he was in urgent need of my help. But I had to help him without wounding his pride.\\n\\n When he came back from his walk in the forest and lay down on a bamboo mat in the corner of my room, I said:\\n\\n \u0027Listen, I was going through the DVDs we managed to bring with us. It turns out we have a film that you haven\u0027t seen.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what are we going to watch it on?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027On my notebook. It\u0027s a small screen, but the quality\u0027s good. We can sit close.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the film?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In the Mood for Love, Wong Kar Wai. A pastiche of nineteen-sixties Hong Kong.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what\u0027s it about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all about us,\u0027 I said. \u0027Two people living in rooms next door to each other. And gradually they start feeling fond of each other.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you kidding?\u0027\\n\\n I picked up the box of the DVD and read the brief blurb out loud:\\n\\n \u0027\"Su and Chow lived in neighbouring rooms. Su\u0027s husband and Chou\u0027s wife are away all the time. Chow recognizes Su\u0027s handbag, a gift from her husband. His wife has one just like it. And Su recognizes Chow\u0027s tie, a gift from his wife. Her husband has one just like it. Though they say nothing, they realize that their marriage partners are being unfaithful with each other. What should they do? Perhaps they should simply surrender to the sweet music of the mood for love?\"\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t understand a thing,\u0027 he said. \u0027All right then, let\u0027s surrender ...\u0027\\n\\n I put the laptop on the floor and put the DVD in the disc drive.\\n\\n For the first twenty minutes or so he watched the film without saying anything or reacting in any way. I knew the film off by heart, and so I didn\u0027t really watch it, I watched him instead - out of the corner of my eye. He looked relaxed and calm. When I got the chance, I moved closer to him, sank my hand into his fur and turned him over on to his side, so that he was lying with his tail towards me. He growled quietly, still watching the screen, but didn\u0027t say anything. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sacred-book-of-the-werewolf/page-16.html","bookId":2607,"book":{"id":2607,"title":"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf","description":"Storyline: One of the most progressive writers at work today, Victor Pelevin?s comic inventiveness has won him comparisons to Kafka, Calvino, and Gogol, and Time has described him as a ?psychedelic Nabokov for the cyberage.?
