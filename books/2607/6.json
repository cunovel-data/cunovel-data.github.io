{"id":98219,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u0027You could say that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And the bike\u0027s yours too?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s a good bike. Disc brakes, and the fork\u0027s made of carbon fibre.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is the computer made of carbon fibre too?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t joke, you already guessed. It\u0027s a rare model, they only make them for Japan. One of the lightest laptops in the world.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I get it. So that\u0027s why it\u0027s standing on a cardboard box, is it? Instead of a table? Aren\u0027t you ashamed when you have visitors?\u0027\\n\\n His tone had begun to get under my skin.\\n\\n \u0027You know, Vladimir Mikhailovich,\u0027 I answered, \u0027to be quite honest, I couldn\u0027t really say what I care less about, the appearance of the things around me or the opinions of the people I meet. Both of them are over and done with far too quickly for me to be bothered.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A dump, that\u0027s what it is,\u0027 he summed up. \u0027Does the local militia know about this tramp\u0027s hideaway?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you going to tip them off?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll see how you behave. Right, let\u0027s go.\u0027\\n\\n We walked to the car in silence, apart from two occasions when Mikhalich swore - the first time when he had to squeeze through the narrow gap between two sheets of plywood, and the second time when he had to duck under a low partition.\\n\\n \u0027Please don\u0027t swear,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027I tore my sleeve. How do you drag your bicycle through here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Easy. In summer I leave it outside. Who\u0027s going to bother climbing in here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, \u0027that\u0027s true enough.\u0027\\n\\n The car was standing outside the gates of the equestrian complex. That meant there was a chance that Mikhalich\u0027s visit would go unnoticed. But what difference did it make now? The local militia could carry on without noticing anything for another hundred years, but Mikhalich and his crowd knew everything. They\u0027d never get off my back. I\u0027ll have to look for a new place to live, I thought, yet again . . .\\n\\n After we\u0027d driven away from the race track, Mikhalich suddenly handed me a scarlet rose with a long stem. I didn\u0027t even notice where he got it from, it was so unexpected. The rose had only just opened and there was still dew glistening on it.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 I said, taking the flower. \u0027I\u0027m touched. But I ought to say straight away that the chances of anything between us aren\u0027t . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not from me,\u0027 he interrupted. \u0027The boss asked me to give it to you. He said you should think about what it means on the way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 I said, \u0027I\u0027ll think about it. What was that device you could see me on?\u0027\\n\\n He stuck one hand into his jacket pocket and took out a small object like a cigarette case with a little screen. There were a few buttons on the cigarette case, but overall it looked pretty unimpressive.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a locator.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what does it locate?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Signals,\u0027 said Mikhalich. \u0027Give me your handbag.\u0027\\n\\n I held out my bag. At the next traffic light he took hold of the strap, turned it over and showed me a little circle of dark foil smaller than a kopeck coin. It was very thin and held in place by a layer of glue. I would never have noticed it - or I\u0027d have thought it was some kind of label.\\n\\n \u0027And when did you stick that on?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When we were on the way to the room to drink champagne,\u0027 he said with a chuckle.\\n\\n \u0027What for? Are you taking such a serious interest in me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In general, yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027But it\u0027s not me any more. Never mind, the boss will soon find out what you\u0027re up to. He\u0027s sorted out trickier specimens than you. By the way, I told him what kind of work you do.\u0027\\n\\n At this stage I didn\u0027t like what was going on at all, but it was too late to get worked up about it: we were already approaching the familiar building. The car drove into the courtyard and straight in through the metal gates of the garage, which immediately closed, cutting us off from the world.\\n\\n \u0027Get out, we\u0027re here.\u0027\\n\\n As soon as Mikhalich got out, I put the rose on his seat - its long thorny stem was almost the same colour, and there was a good chance that Mikhalich would just plonk his sturdy backside down on it.\\n\\n \u0027Take your shoes off,\u0027 he said when I got out after him.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s this, are you taking me to be shot?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That depends,\u0027 he chuckled. \u0027There are slippers over there by the lift.\u0027\\n\\n I looked around. A round hole in the ceiling, a steel pole, a spiral staircase - we were in a familiar place. But this time there was a light on in the garage and I spotted the door of a lift that I hadn\u0027t noticed the last time. Lying on the floor in front of it there were several pairs of various different slippers. I chose a pair of blue ones with round pompoms - they looked so touchingly defenceless that only a monster could possibly harm any girl who was wearing them.\\n\\n The lift door opened and Mikhalich gestured for me to go in. There were two large triangular buttons on the panel, combined to form a rhombus. Mikhalich pressed the upper button, and the lift took off with a mighty jerk, carrying us upwards.\\n\\n When the door opened a few seconds later, I was blinded by light coming from all directions. Alexander was standing there, engulfed in the bright swirling vortex. He was wearing a military uniform and his face was covered with a gauze mask.\\n\\n \u0027Hello, Ada,\u0027 he said. \u0027Please come in. No, Mikhalich, I\u0027m sorry - I\u0027m not inviting you. Today three would be a crowd . . .\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027d noticed the penthouse on my first visit. Only I hadn\u0027t guessed that it was a penthouse - from below it looked like a dark knob on the end of the huge concrete pencil. It could have been taken for the housing of the lift motors, some kind of technical premises or a boiler room. But those turquoise walls turned out to be transparent from the inside.\\n\\n Before I\u0027d even taken it all in, they started turning dark before my very eyes, until they looked like bottle glass. I\u0027d just been squinting at the bright sunlight, and all of a sudden in just a few seconds an entire house had condensed around me. It hadn\u0027t been visible before in the sunshine bouncing off all the mirror surfaces.\\n\\n I learned later that it was an expensive technical gismo - the transparency of the walls was adjusted using special liquid-crystal membranes that were controlled by a computer system. At the time, though, what happened seemed like a miracle. Only since long, long ago the response that miracles provoke in me has been ironic, not to say contemptuous.\\n\\n \u0027Hi, Shurik,\u0027 I said. \u0027What\u0027s with the sideshow effects? No money for normal blinds?\u0027\\n\\n He was taken aback. But it only took him a second to recover and he laughed.\\n\\n \u0027Shurik,\u0027 he said. \u0027I like that. Well yes. Since you\u0027re Ada now, I suppose I\u0027m Shurik.\u0027\\n\\n His light-grey double-breasted uniform jacket with a lieutenant general\u0027s shoulder straps and dark-blue trousers with wide red stripes looked a little theatrical. He came up to me, removed the gauze mask from his face, squeezed his eyes shut and drew in the air through his nose. I felt like asking why he was always doing that, but I thought better of it. He opened his eyes and his glance fell on my earrings.\\n\\n \u0027What an amusing idea,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Great, isn\u0027t it? And especially beautiful because the stones are different. Do you like it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right. Did Mikhalich give you the flower?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I answered. \u0027And he told me I should think about the meaning of the message. But I haven\u0027t come up with anything. Maybe you can tell me yourself?\u0027\\n\\n He scratched his head. He seemed disconcerted by my question.\\n\\n \u0027Do you know the folktale about the little scarlet flower?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which one exactly?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027I think there is only one.\u0027\\n\\n He nodded towards a desk with a computer and a silver figurine standing on it. There was a book lying beside the figurine, with bookmarks in several pages. The half-effaced red letters of the title on its cover read: Russian Fairy Tales.\\n\\n \u0027The story was written down by Sergei Aksakov,\u0027 he said. \u0027His housekeeper Pelagia told him it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what\u0027s it about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About a beautiful girl and a beast.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what\u0027s the little flower got to do with it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was the reason everything began. Do you really not know this fairy tale?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s long, but the gist is this: a beautiful girl asked her father to bring her a scarlet flower. The father found one in a magical garden a long way away and picked it. But the garden was guarded by a terrible monster. He caught the beautiful girl\u0027s father, and she had to become the monster\u0027s prisoner so that he would release her father. The monster was ugly, but kind. She fell in love with him, first for his kindness, and then simply in love. And when they kissed, the spell was broken and the monster turned into a prince.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Aha,\u0027 I said. \u0027Do you have any idea what it\u0027s about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes? What is it about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About love conquering all.\u0027\\n\\n I laughed. He really was quite amusing. He\u0027d probably bumped off a few heavy hoods and ordered a hit on some banker, so now, with typical human presumption, he thought he was a monster. And he also thought that love would save him.\\n\\n He took me by the arm and led me across to a futuristic divan standing between two groves of dwarf bonsais with miniature arbours, bridges and even waterfalls.\\n\\n \u0027Why are you laughing?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027I can explain,\u0027 I said, sitting down on the divan and pulling my legs up under me.\\n\\n \u0027Okay, explain.\u0027\\n\\n He sat at the other end of the divan and crossed his legs. I noticed the edge of a holster peeping out from under his uniform jacket.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s one of those folktales that express the horror and pain of a woman\u0027s first sexual experience,\u0027 I said. \u0027There are lots of stories like that, and the one you just told me is a classic example. It\u0027s a metaphor of how a woman discovers the essentially bestial nature of man and becomes aware of her own power over that beast. And the little scarlet flower that her father picks is such a literal symbol of defloration, amplified by the theme of incest, that I find it hard to believe the story was told by a housekeeper. It was probably composed by some twentieth-century Viennese postgraduate to illustrate his thesis. He invented the story, and the housekeeper Pelagia, and the writer Aksakov.\u0027\\n\\n While I was talking, his expression turned noticeably gloomier.\\n\\n \u0027Where did you pick up all that stuff?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all truisms. Everybody knows it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you believe it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That this fairy tale is not about how love conquers everything on earth, but how defecation realizes its power over incest?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Defloration,\u0027 I corrected him.\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter. Is that what you really think?\u0027\\n\\n I thought about it.\\n\\n \u0027I . . . I don\u0027t think anything. That\u0027s simply the contemporary discourse of folktales.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So you\u0027re saying that because of this discourse, when someone gives you a scarlet flower you think it\u0027s a symbol of defecation and incest?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, don\u0027t be like that,\u0027 I replied, a little embarrassed. \u0027When someone gives me a scarlet flower I . . . I\u0027m simply pleased.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank God,\u0027 he said. \u0027And as for contemporary discourse, it\u0027s high time to take an aspen stake and stuff it back up the cocaine-and-amphetamine polluted backside that produced it.\u0027\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t expected such a sweeping generalization.\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So it won\u0027t defile our little scarlet flower.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 I said, \u0027I understand about the cocaine. You mean Dr Freud. He did have that little peccadillo. But what have amphetamines got to do with it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can explain,\u0027 he said, and tucked his legs up underneath himself in a parody of my pose.\\n\\n \u0027Okay, explain.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All those French parrots who invented discourse were high on amphetamines all the time. In the evening they take barbiturates to get to sleep, and they start off the morning with amphetamines so they can generate as much discourse as possible before they start taking barbiturates to get back to sleep again. That\u0027s all there is to discourse. Didn\u0027t you know that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where did you get information like that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There was a course at the FSB Academy about modern psychedelic culture. Counter-brainwashing. Oh yes, I forgot to say - they\u0027re all queers too. In case you were going to ask what the backside had to do with anything.\u0027\\n\\n The conversation was headed in the wrong direction, and it was time to change the subject. I prefer to do that abruptly.\\n\\n \u0027Alexander,\u0027 I said, \u0027explain to me, so I can understand, just what I\u0027m doing here. Do you want to screw me or re-educate me?\u0027\\n\\n He shuddered, as if I\u0027d said something terrible, leapt up off the divan and began striding backwards and forwards past the window - or rather, not the window, but a rectangle in the wall that was still transparent.\\n\\n \u0027Are you trying to shock me?\u0027 he asked. \u0027You\u0027re wasting your time. I know there\u0027s a pure, vulnerable soul hiding behind your affected cynicism.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Affected cynicism? You mean me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not even cynicism,\u0027 he said, stopping. \u0027Flippancy. A failure to understand the serious things you\u0027re playing with, like a little child with a hand grenade. Let\u0027s talk frankly, to the point.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay, let\u0027s.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You say - the bestial essence of man, the horror of the first coitus . . . These are such terrible, dark things. If you want to know, even I am sometimes afraid to glance into those abysses . . .\u0027\\n\\n He really was funny after all - \u0027even I\u0027. He went on:\\n\\n \u0027But you talk about it all like it was just peanuts. Don\u0027t you have any fear of the beast in a man? Of the man in the beast?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not a bit,\u0027 I said. \u0027Mikhalich told you who I am, didn\u0027t he?\u0027 He nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Well, then. If I had problems like that I wouldn\u0027t be able to do my job.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not afraid of the intimate contact with someone else\u0027s body - immense and ugly, living according to its own laws?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I simply adore it,\u0027 I said and smiled.\\n\\n He looked at me and shook his head dubiously.\\n\\n \u0027I mean physical intimacy? In the very lowest sense?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For spiritual intimacy I charge an extra hundred and fifty per cent. How long can you go on chewing over the same thing? Do you always yatter on like this before you have a screw?\u0027\\n\\n He frowned.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no need to talk to me as if I were a bandit. That\u0027s because of the FSB uniform, is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe. Try taking it off. Including the trousers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do you talk that way?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you find me at all attractive?\u0027\\n\\n I lowered my head and gave him an offended look from under my eyebrows, screwing my eyes up slightly and pouting my lips. I worked on that look for over a thousand years, and there\u0027s no point in trying to describe it. It\u0027s my own patented brand of provocation - brazenness and innocence in the same armour-piercing package: it zaps straight through the client and then ricochets back to get him again. The only effective protection I know against that gaze is to look in the other direction. Alexander was looking at me.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I do,\u0027 he said with a nervous twitch of his head. \u0027And how!\u0027\\n\\n I realized the critical moment had arrived. When the client jerks his head like that, the control centres of his brain are failing, and he can throw himself at you at any moment.\\n\\n \u0027I need to go to the bathroom,\u0027 I said. \u0027Where is your bathroom here?\u0027\\n\\n He pointed to a round wall of blue semi-transparent glass. There was no door - the way in was through a passage that curled like a snail\u0027s shell.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll just be a moment.\u0027\\n\\n Once I was inside I took a deep breath.\\n\\n It was beautiful on the other side of the wall. The gold stars on a blue background and the bath lined with mother-of-pearl reminded me of the baths at Pompeii - perhaps the designer had deliberately evoked that image. But the owner was unlikely to know about that.\\n\\n It\u0027s risky to push a client up so far so fast, I thought, some day it will end badly. And maybe Alexander was injecting something, like Mikhalich? Or taking something by mouth? There must be some reason for the strange way he kept sniffing the air like that . . .\\n\\n I took off my jeans and put them on the floor, then took a look at myself in the mirror. My pride and joy was like a Japanese fan painted to look like a red brush. It was beautiful. And against the starry blue background it looked simple fabulous. I was more sure of my powers than I had ever been - I was simply brimming over with energy, just a little bit more and the hairs of my tail would have started shooting out little balls of lightning. I remembered the funny Russian saying \u0027to hold your tail like a pistol\u0027, meaning to keep your spirits up. I don\u0027t know where it came from, but a fox must have been involved one way or another. Well then, I thought, all guns blazing . . .\\n\\n When I reached the way out, I prepared for take-off by taking a few deep breaths, seized that one and only right moment when every cell in your body says \u0027Now!\u0027 and hurtled out of the bathroom like a tornado.\\n\\n After that there was no time to think. I braked, turned my backside to the target, thrust my hands and feet hard against the floor and curved my tail above my head. I caught a glimpse of my reflection in one of the mirror surfaces - I looked like a menacing red scorpion prepared for battle . . . Alexander raised his eyes to look at me, but before he could even blink, my tail had delivered its precise, perfectly aligned, impeccably accurate blow to the very centre of his brain.\\n\\n He put his hand over his eyes, as if to protect them against a blinding light. Then he lowered his hand and our eyes met. Something was happening that wasn\u0027t right. My tail simply was-n\u0027t able to sense him - and he was standing just a few steps away and looking at me as if he couldn\u0027t believe that anything so beautiful could possibly exist in all the world.\\n\\n \u0027Adele,\u0027 he whispered, \u0027my darling . . .\u0027\\n\\n And then the nightmare began.\\n\\n He staggered, made a terrible howling sound and literally fell out of his own body - as if it were a bud that opened up into a sinister, shaggy flower in just a few seconds. It turned out that the man who was called Alexander was no more than a drawing on a door into the beyond. Now that door had opened, and the creature who had been watching me through the keyhole for a long time had come tumbling out.\\n\\n Standing there in front of me was a monster, something halfway between a man and a wolf, with gaping jaws and piercing yellow eyes. At first I thought Alexander\u0027s clothes had disappeared. Then I realized that his tunic and trousers had been transformed together with him: his torso was covered with ash-grey fur, but his hind legs were darker, and I could see the irregular traces of the stripes on them. There was an elongated mark on the beast\u0027s chest, like the imprint of a tie that has slipped to one side. When my gaze moved lower I was horror-struck. I\u0027d never seen how that place looked on a wolf that was aroused. And to my mind it looked more terrible than any gaping jaws.\\n\\n At that point I realized I was still standing on all fours with my tail up in the air and my defenceless behind stuck out in his direction. Defenceless, because my antenna wasn\u0027t working and I had nothing to stop him with. I could guess how my pose might be interpreted, but I was paralysed - instead of jumping back, I kept looking at him over my shoulder. That happens in some dreams - you need to run away fast, but instead you go on standing there and there\u0027s just no way you can lift your leaden feet off the ground. I couldn\u0027t even wipe the idiot grin off my face - like a burglar caught on the job.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Grr-rra-rra,\u0027 he said. \u0027Gr-rrrrra...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hey, bro,\u0027 I babbled, \u0027wait. I\u0027ll explain everything . . .\u0027\\n\\n He growled and took a step towards me.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you even think about it, all right? I\u0027m serious, you big grey wolf, slow down . . .\u0027\\n\\n He fell gently on to his front paws or hands and took another step towards me. Entirely different words were required. But where could I find them?\\n\\n \u0027Listen . . . Let\u0027s discuss everything calmly, eh?\u0027\\n\\n He grinned, opening his jaws wide and raising his huge grey tail, almost copying my working pose.\\n\\n \u0027Wait, grey beast,\u0027 I whispered, \u0027don\u0027t . . .\u0027\\n\\n He jumped, and for a second I thought the world had been covered by a terrible, low storm cloud. The next moment the cloud collapsed on top of me.\\n\\n Lying on the divan, covered with something like the skin of an albino mammoth, I sobbed into the pillow, unable to understand how there could have been so many tears inside me - the pillow was already soaked on both sides.\\n\\n \u0027Ada,\u0027 Alexander said and put his hand on my shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Go away, you monster,\u0027 I sobbed and shook his hand off.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he said timidly, \u0027I didn\u0027t mean . . .\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sacred-book-of-the-werewolf/page-6.html","bookId":2607,"book":{"id":2607,"title":"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf","description":"Storyline: One of the most progressive writers at work today, Victor Pelevin?s comic inventiveness has won him comparisons to Kafka, Calvino, and Gogol, and Time has described him as a ?psychedelic Nabokov for the cyberage.?
