Enter it.\u0027\n \u0027But how?\u0027\n \u0027By any means that allow him to do so.\u0027\n \u0027But surely there must be some instructions that the superwerewolf receives?\u0027\n \u0027They consist precisely of this.\u0027\n \u0027And that is all?\u0027\n The Yellow Master nodded.\n \u0027So it turns out that a super-werewolf is one who enters the Rainbow Stream, and the Rainbow Stream is what the superwerewolf enters?\u0027\n \u0027Precisely.\u0027\n \u0027But that means that the former is defined in terms of the latter, and the latter is defined in terms of the former. What meaning is there in all this?\u0027\n \u0027A most profound one. Both the Rainbow Stream and the path of the super-werewolf lie out of this world and are beyond the reach of the everyday mind - even a fox\u0027s. But they are directly related to each other. Therefore, it is only possible to speak of the former in relation to the latter. And of the latter in relation to the former.\u0027\n \u0027And is it possible to add anything more to this?\u0027\n \u0027It is.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027That the Rainbow Stream is not a stream at all, and the superwerewolf is not a werewolf at all. One should not become attached to words. They are only required as fleeting footholds. If you attempt to carry them with you, they will drag you down into the abyss. Therefore, they should be cast off immediately.\u0027\n I took a little time to think about what I had heard.\n \u0027It is intriguing. It turns out that the supreme teaching for foxes consists of only two words that are related only to each other and are not amenable to any explanation. And in addition, even these words have to be cast off once they have been spoken ... It would seem that the fox who fed the Buddha did not have very good karma. And did she herself succeed in entering the Rainbow Stream?\u0027\n The Yellow Master nodded.\n \u0027However, that only happened quite recently. And she did not leave behind any instructions for other were-creatures. That is why I am obliged to transmit the teaching to you.\u0027\n \u0027It is hard to believe in the truth of such a teaching.\u0027\n \u0027The higher teachings are called higher because they differ from those to which you are accustomed. And if something appears true to you, you may already regard it as false.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Because otherwise you would have no need of any teachings. You would already know the truth.\u0027\n That was logical. But his explanations reminded me of those philosophical syllogisms that are primarily intended to confound the mind.\n \u0027But even so,\u0027 I persisted, \u0027how can a teaching consist of only two words?\u0027\n \u0027The higher the teaching, the fewer the words on which it leans for support. Words are like anchors - they appear to provide a reliable grasp on a teaching, but in reality they only hold the mind in captivity. That is why the most perfect teachings dispense words and symbols.\u0027\n \u0027Of course, that is so,\u0027 I said. \u0027But even in order to explain the superiority of a wordless teaching, you have had to speak many words. How can only two words be enough for someone to guide himself through life?\u0027\n \u0027The higher teachings are intended for beings with higher abilities. And for those who lack them, there are volumes upon volumes of nonsense, in which they can rummage for the whole of their lives.\u0027\n \u0027And do I have higher abilities?\u0027 I asked in a quiet voice.\n \u0027You would not be sitting here otherwise.\u0027\n That altered the situation somewhat.\n \u0027And are there many super-werewolves in the world?\u0027\n \u0027Only one. Now that is you. If you wish, you can enter the Rainbow Stream. But you will need to make an effort.\u0027\n Who would not feel flattered on hearing that she has higher abilities? And the prospect of becoming a unique being was something that completely took my breath away. I thought about it.\n \u0027And the fox who succeeded in entering the Rainbow Stream, what is known about her?\u0027\n \u0027Very little,\u0027 the Yellow Master said. \u0027Your predecessor lived in a little mountain village, practised extreme asceticism and completely forswore all contact with human beings.\u0027\n \u0027How did she feed herself?\u0027\n \u0027She used her tail to convince a pumpkin patch that spring had come. And then she absorbed the life-force of the pumpkins ...\u0027\n \u0027How terrible,\u0027 I whispered. \u0027And what happened to her?\u0027\n \u0027One day she simply disappeared, and that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027And she did not leave any writings?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027That was rather egotistical of her.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps you will leave some.\u0027\n \u0027But do I really have to switch from men to vegetables?\u0027\n \u0027The Buddha did not leave any instructions on that score. Listen to what your heart tells you. And do not swerve from the path.\u0027\n I bowed twice.\n \u0027I promise to strive obstinately for the goal, if you will grant me the transmission of which you have spoken.\u0027\n \u0027You have already received the transmission.\u0027\n \u0027When?\u0027 I asked.\n \u0027Just now.\u0027\n \u0027Is that all?\u0027\n I must have looked very perplexed.\n \u0027It is quite enough. All the rest would only introduce confusion into your ginger head.\u0027\n \u0027Then what am I to do?\u0027\n The Yellow Master sighed.\n \u0027If you were a human being, I would simply smack you across the forehead with my stick,\u0027 he said, nodding towards his knotty staff, \u0027and send you to work in the garden. There is nothing higher than this teaching and some day you will understand that. But the path of the super-werewolf is a special one. And since you are so persistent in asking me what you must do, I will tell you. You must find the key.\u0027\n \u0027The key? To what?\u0027\n \u0027To the Rainbow Stream.\u0027\n \u0027And what kind of key is it?\u0027\n \u0027I have no idea. I am not a super-werewolf. I am a simple monk. And now be on your way - your palanquin is waiting for you.\u0027\n \u0027And ever since then I have continued on my way,\u0027 I said, and stopped speaking.\n My story seemed to have made a strong impression on Alexander.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 he asked me. \u0027Have you found the key?\u0027\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\n \u0027And what is it?\u0027\n \u0027A correct understanding of your own nature. Everything that I tried to explain to you.\u0027\n \u0027So you\u0027ve already entered the Rainbow Stream?\u0027\n \u0027You could say that,\u0027 I replied.\n \u0027What did it look like?\u0027\n \u0027First you have to understand what the super-werewolf is.\u0027\n \u0027So what is it?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s you.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s what I keep telling you,\u0027 he said plaintively. \u0027But you confuse me. You say it\u0027s really you. You everywhere.\u0027\n \u0027Again you don\u0027t understand. You think you\u0027re the superwerewolf because you can break light bulbs and knock flies down by just looking at them . . .\u0027\n \u0027Not only flies,\u0027 he said. \u0027And not only by looking at them. You can\u0027t even imagine what I can do.\u0027\n \u0027What can you do?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t even have to look, get it? I only have to think it. For instance, yesterday evening I happened to the General Customs Inspector.\u0027\n \u0027What, did he die?\u0027\n \u0027What for? He just muttered in his sleep and turned over on to his other side. I wiped him clean out.\u0027\n \u0027And what does that mean?\u0027\n He shrugged his shoulders.\n \u0027It means he\u0027ll get some obscure job in some foundation and will sit there until he fades into the wallpaper. And all his kickbacks will go to the right people now. I mean, to the honest people with clean hands.\u0027\n \u0027What a tough guy you are,\u0027 I said. \u0027And how do you do it?\u0027\n He thought about it.\n \u0027It\u0027s like sex, only the other way round. It\u0027s hard to explain. You know yourself, it\u0027s all in the tail. But I haven\u0027t figured out the details yet ... So you admit I am the super-werewolf after all?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t understand anything properly,\u0027 I said. \u0027Just because you can swat flies and customs officials, that doesn\u0027t make you a super-werewolf. You don\u0027t even have any right to think you\u0027re a super-werewolf yet.\u0027\n \u0027And you do have the right to think so, do you?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I do,\u0027 I said modestly, but firmly.\n \u0027Seems to me you\u0027re coming on a bit too strong altogether, Ginger. There\u0027s no place left in the world for me any more.\u0027\n \u0027This whole world is yours. Just understand who you really are.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m the super-werewolf.\u0027\n \u0027Right. But what is a super-werewolf?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s me.\u0027\n \u0027There you go again. I thought you were a keen-eyed lion, but you\u0027re a blind dog.\u0027\n He shuddered as if he\u0027d been lashed with a whip.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s just a teaching about the gaze of the lion,\u0027 I explained hastily, sensing that I\u0027d said too much. \u0027They say that if you throw a stick to a dog, it will watch the stick. But if you throw a stick to a lion, it will keep its eyes fixed on the thrower. It\u0027s a formal turn of phrase that was used in debates in ancient China when an opponent started clutching at words and stopped seeing what was really important.\u0027\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 he said, \u0027let\u0027s drop it. So maybe you\u0027ll tell me what the super-werewolf is?\u0027\n \u0027The super-werewolf is the one you see when you look deep inside yourself for a long time.\u0027\n \u0027But you said there\u0027s nothing in there.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right. There isn\u0027t anything there. That is the superwerewolf. \u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Because that nothing can become anything at all.\u0027\n \u0027How\u0027s that?\u0027\n \u0027Look. You\u0027re a werewolf, because you can turn into, erm, a wolf. I\u0027m a were-creature, because I\u0027m a fox who pretends to be a human being. But the super-werewolf becomes you, me, this bag of apples, this cup, this crate - everything that you look at in turn. That\u0027s the first reason why it\u0027s called the super-werewolf. Besides, any were-creature can be caught by the tail, figuratively speaking.\u0027\n \u0027Okay, probably,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027But the super-werewolf can\u0027t be caught by the tail. Because it doesn\u0027t have a body. And that\u0027s the second reason why it\u0027s called that. Do you understand?\u0027\n \u0027Not entirely.\u0027\n \u0027Remember, when we were flying back from the north, you told me that when you were a child, you used to dream about a diving suit in which you could land on the sun, dive to the bottom of the ocean, jump into a black hole and come back out?\u0027\n \u0027I remember.\u0027\n \u0027Well then, that\u0027s exactly the kind of diving suit the superwerewolf wears. It\u0027s simply a void that can be filled with anything. Nothing can stick to this void. Nothing can touch it or stain it, because you only have to take away what it\u0027s been filled with, and it will be the same as it was before. There\u0027s nowhere for the local cop to put a registration stamp on it, and nothing for your Mikhalich to attach his bugs to.\u0027\n \u0027I get it. Now I get it,\u0027 he said, turning pale. \u0027That\u0027s really impressive. No security service could ever catch someone like that!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m glad you appreciate that.\u0027\n \u0027And how do I become it?\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s no way.\u0027 I said.\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Think about it.\u0027\n \u0027Because there can only be one super-werewolf, and it\u0027s already you? Do I understand things right now, Ginger?\u0027\n \u0027No, Grey One, no. You can\u0027t become it, because you have always been it. The super-werewolf is your own mind, the same one you use from morning till night to think all sorts of nonsense. \u0027\n \u0027So I\u0027m the super-werewolf after all, am I?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s my mind, isn\u0027t it? Then what\u0027s the problem?\u0027\n \u0027The problem is that your mind isn\u0027t actually yours.\u0027\n \u0027Then whose is it?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s not possible to say that it is anybody\u0027s at all. Or what it\u0027s like and where it is. All these concepts arise within it, that is, it precedes everything else without exception. Do you understand? Whatever you imagine, consider, believe or know for sure, the mind\u0027s what will do it.\u0027\n \u0027Are you talking about the brain?\u0027\n \u0027No. The brain is one of the concepts that exist in the mind.\u0027\n \u0027But the mind arises because there is a brain,\u0027 he said uncertainly.\n \u0027Those villains have really brainwashed you out of your wits,\u0027 I sighed. \u0027People have no idea what mind is. Instead they study the brain, or the psyche, or Freud\u0027s love letters to Einstein. And scientists seriously believe that mind is the product of certain chemical and electrical processes in the brain. That\u0027s the same as thinking that a TV set is the cause of the film showing on it. Or that a salary is the cause of human existence.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s what economists do think.\u0027\n \u0027Right. Well, let them think it. Let them generate their electrical impulses, steal tranches of credit, make official protests, measure the amplitude and the velocity, give the blowjob and take the derivative coefficient, and then determine their rating. Fortunately for this world, we foxes are here in it, as well as all those clowns. We know the secret. And now you know it too. Or you almost know it.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, right,\u0027 he said. \u0027And who else knows it, apart from foxes?\u0027\n \u0027Only the chosen are supposed to know it.\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027re not afraid to reveal it to me?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Why? Because I\u0027m one of the chosen too?\u0027\n \u0027Because only the mind can know this secret. And the mind has no one to hide it from anyway. It is one.\u0027\n \u0027One?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said, \u0027one in all, and all from one.\u0027\n \u0027Then who are these chosen ones?\u0027\n \u0027The chosen ones are those who understand that any worm or butterfly, or even a blade of grass at the edge of the road, are chosen ones just like them, only they don\u0027t know about it for the time being, and you have to take great care in order not to offend any one of them accidentally.\u0027\n \u0027I still don\u0027t understand what mind is,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Nobody understands that. Although, on the other hand, everybody knows it. Because it is precisely mind that is listening to what I say right now.\u0027\n \u0027Aha,\u0027 he said. \u0027I get it now . . . Maybe not everything, from beginning to end, but the way I understand it, there isn\u0027t any end to all this anyway . . .\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s it!\u0027 I said. If only that was always the way.\n \u0027Okay, let\u0027s say we\u0027ve figured out the super-werewolf. But what\u0027s the Rainbow Stream?\u0027\n \u0027Simply the world around us,\u0027 I said. \u0027You see the colours - blue, red, green? They appear and disappear in your mind. That is the Rainbow Stream. Every one of us is a super-werewolf in the Rainbow Stream.\u0027\n \u0027You mean, we\u0027ve already entered the Rainbow Stream?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sacred-book-of-the-werewolf/page-20.html","bookId":2607,"book":{"id":2607,"title":"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf","description":"Storyline: \n One of the most progressive writers at work today, Victor Pelevin?s comic inventiveness has won him comparisons to Kafka, Calvino, and Gogol, and Time has described him as a ?psychedelic Nabokov for the cyberage.?
