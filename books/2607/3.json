{"id":98216,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"A FAIRY-TALE CUM TRUE!\n Small breasts for big money. A little ginger kitten is waiting for a call from a well-to-do gentleman. Classic sex, deep and royal head, anal, petting, bondage, whipping (including the Russian Knout), foot fetish, strap-on, sakura branch, lesbo, oral and anal stimulation, cunnilingus (including compulsory), role-swapping, two-way gold and silver rain, fisting, piercing, catheter, copro, enema, gentle and heavy domination, Mistress and Slave Girl services. Face control. Visits by arrangement. Many things are possible. Almost everything. Shag me and forget! If you can . . .\n A fine little kitten, I thought when I reread what I\u0027d written. I must admit I didn\u0027t really understand what the bandage was doing in there and why anyone would want a sakura branch up his ass. I didn\u0027t have a very clear idea of what fisting was, either, but judging from what the other announcements said, it was either oral or vaginal, which made it the same kind of filth as all the rest. I supposed it must mean shoving in the fist? Did that mean it could be per oris too? In one of the announcements I even saw the following list: \u0027fellatio, PR, cunnilingus\u0027. What did that mean? Or \u0027strap-on\u0027? It sounded like something cosmic, from the romantic sixties of the last century. But, fortunately, I didn\u0027t have to know what strap-on was - the only thing needed was to introduce myself to the client.\n I don\u0027t think anyone but a fox can understand how I could provide a \u0027strap-on\u0027 service without even knowing what it is. It\u0027s not easy to explain that kind of thing, all you can do is offer analogies. I sense a client\u0027s consciousness as a warm, spongy sphere, and in order to send the poor soul into the world of his dreams, first I have to make a little dent in the very hottest spot of that sphere with my tail, and then make the little dent smooth itself out and ripple across the surface of the sphere. That will just be a strap-on. But if I gently force the dent to fold back over on to itself so that it becomes a tender little nipple, that will be the kind of strap-on the client will remember and drool over until his mind finally drowns in the cold ocean of Alzheimer\u0027s disease.\n The same thing applies to fisting, light domination and all the rest. If, say, you want to take an elderly transvestite with higher musical education and a gold tooth in his mouth, and beat him to death with a baseball bat, even then I can assist you with your dubious project. But it\u0027s better for me not to know everything that\u0027s going on in someone else\u0027s mind - it\u0027s easier to keep my own soul pure that way.\n That\u0027s why I had no doubts about my ability to cope with the list of services advertised, no matter what they might be. But there was still something missing in the text. I thought for a moment and then, after \u0027A little ginger kitten is waiting for a call from well-to-do gentleman\u0027 I wrote in:\n Transsexual, versatile, penis 26x4. Always following the rules means denying yourself all the pleasures! We need to know how to commit the follies that our nature demands of us.\n Ah, if only they knew what our true nature is, I sighed, and took out \u0027Transsexual\u0027. As the chef of the Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich used to say, before the revolution: \u0027You can\u0027t spoil gruel with butter, but you can spoil butter with gruel.\u0027 Something else was required . . . After thinking about it for a while, I decided to replace \u0027Mistress and Slave Girl services\u0027 with \u0027Mistress, Slave Girl and Ray of Light services\u0027. That didn\u0027t impose any additional physical exertions on me, not even imaginary ones, but it opened up wide scope for fantasy.\n Fantasy . . . A courtesan I used to know in China during the Late Han period often used to say that a man\u0027s weak spot is the fantasies that fill his mind. When she got old, she was given to a nomad leader as severance pay, and he boiled the poor woman in mare\u0027s milk, hoping to bring back her youth. A weakness can sometimes become a terrible strength.\n I could have gone on improving the text ad infinitum - everyone knows that for a real poet the process continues until the moment the publisher calls round to collect the manuscript. In this case I had to collect the manuscript from myself. And so I decided to put a full stop after the final touchingly artless couplet at the end:\n Turbulent stream, pining without affection,\n I promise you a passionate connection!\n I\u0027d never worked with the site whores.ru before. The procedure for posting information turned out to be the same as on other similar facilities, but there was one unpleasant difference. Posting plain text cost 150 dollars, photographs were twenty apiece. I had three of the WMZ cards that they accepted for payment on the site - a hundred, a fifty and a twenty. Obviously the whole thing was set up to suit these values. I could only post one photo - or else I would have to go to the nearest Metro station for a new supply of Internet money. I decided to make do with one picture, but to send it immediately, so that in the morning it would already be hanging out there on the wires. But I still didn\u0027t manage to send the photograph off quickly - I spent almost an hour choosing it.\n The choice proved difficult because every alternative tinted the services in my list in a different hue, illuminating the strap-on and the fisting with new nuances of meaning . . . Eventually I settled on an old black and white photograph - me in front of a set of bookshelves, with a volume of Alexander Blok in my hands. The book was The Snow Mask, and the photo itself, taken in the 1930s, had a magical, mysterious air to it, as if it had captured the final glimmering of the Silver Age of Russian literature - which was very appropriate for the final service offered in my list. It was a good thing I\u0027d had my most precious negatives and daguerrotypes digitized.\n All that left me to do was choose my artistic pseudonym. I found a suitable list through Google and chose a name from the very beginning - Adele, which reminded me of the Russian word for hell - \u0027ad\u0027.\n It was a good quality photo and it took up half a megabyte. I clicked on the \u0027send\u0027 button. My little face obediently smiled, shot through the wires into the wall, was swept into the telephone cable and skipped along the electrical backbone of the street, to be intertwined with the other names and faces hurtling along from God knew where to God knew where else, as it dashed towards the distant network gateway.\n The call in response to the announcement came the next morning, shortly after eleven. The client\u0027s name was Pavel Ivanovich. His interest had been caught by the line about the Russian knout. It turned out that he had his own Russian knout, in fact not just one of them, but five - four on a special carved wooden stand and one in his tennis bag.\n Let me say straight away that I would quite happily have thrown all mention of Pavel Ivanovich out of my memoirs, but without him the narrative would be incomplete. He played an important part in my life, in the same way as a filthy, slimy pedestrian underpass might if the heroine happens to walk through it on her way to the other bank of the river of fate. And so I shall have to tell you about him, and I beg your forgiveness in advance for the unappetizing details. Some computer games have a \u0027Tx2\u0027 button, and after you press it time moves twice as fast as before. So now I\u0027ll press my little \u0027Tx2\u0027 button and try to boil him down into the least possible volume.\n I think it was Diogenes Laertius who told the story about a philosopher who studied for three years to rid himself of all passion, paying money to every man who insulted him. When his period of study was completed, he stopped giving out money, but the habitual skills remained with him: one day he was insulted by some ignoramus, and instead of setting about him with his fists, he began to laugh. \u0027Well, did you ever,\u0027 he said, \u0027today I received for nothing what I\u0027d been paying for three whole years!\u0027\n When I first read about this, I felt envious that I didn\u0027t have any similar practice in my life. But after I met Pavel Ivanovich I realized that now I did.\n Pavel Ivanovich was an elderly scholar of the humanities who looked like a melted-down, hairy pink candle. Formerly he had been a right-wing liberal (I didn\u0027t understand what this outrageous word-combination meant), but following the common trend he had repented to such an extent that he had assumed personal responsibility for all the woes of the motherland. In order to soothe his soul, he had to take a flogging once or twice a week from Young Russia, which he had condemned to poverty by forcing it to earn a living by flogging old perverts instead of studying in university. And so he was caught in a closed circle, which I might possibly have pondered on more deeply, if only he hadn\u0027t masturbated during the session. That destroyed all the mystery.\n If he\u0027d had a real sex worker from somewhere in Ukraine as his own Young Russia, she would never have agreed to be paid only 50 dollars for a one-hour session. Flogging someone is hard work, even when the procedure is merely a hypnotic suggestion. However, I began going to Pavel Ivanovich\u0027s place not just for the sake of the money, but also because he irritated me quite incredibly, provoking uncontrollable spasms of wild fury in me. I had to summon up all my willpower to keep myself in hand. For sheer practical reasons I ought to have gone for richer sponsors, but character has to be trained during the difficult periods of life, when the meaning of doing it is not obvious. That\u0027s when it does the most good.\n So that I could understand my part in what was going on, Pavel Ivanovich gave me a detailed account of all the reasons for his repentance. I was going to take another 50 dollars an hour for this understanding, and I was just waiting for the moment to come when I could bring up the matter of the extra charge. But it never came - Pavel Ivanovich spoke at exceptional length:\n \u0027Between 1940 and 1946, my dear, the volume of industrial output in Russia fell by twenty-five per cent. And that was with all the horrors of war. But between 1990 and 1999 it slumped by over half . . . worse than Genghis Khan and Hitler taken together. And that\u0027s not just commie propaganda and lies. It\u0027s what Joseph Stieglitz writes - the chief economist of the World Bank and a Nobel Prize winner. Have you read Globalisation and its Discontents? What a terrifying book! And America doesn\u0027t even need the atom bomb, because it has the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund . . .\u0027\n I actually began to forget what I was doing there in his apartment, and only the leather knout lying on the table between us reminded me of it. It soon emerged that Pavel Ivanovich\u0027s repentance was total, embracing not only the economic aspect of the Russian reforms, but also the cultural history of the last few decades.\n \u0027Did you know,\u0027 he said, staring keenly into my eyes, \u0027that the CIA actually financed the beatnik movement and the psychological revolution? The goal was to create an attractive image of the West for our youth. They wanted to pretend that America has fun. So they did - and for a while they even believed it themselves. But the funniest thing of all is that all these children of LSD generals who tried KGB and strove so hard to copy the beatniks really were doing just what the CIA wanted, that is, they were committing the very sin the Party accused them of! And they were the future intelligentsia, the nerve system of the nation . . .\u0027\n In speaking of the intelligentsia\u0027s debt of guilt to the nation, he kept using two terms that I thought were synonyms - \u0027intelligentsia\u0027 and \u0027intellectuals\u0027. After a while I just had to ask:\n \u0027But what difference is there between a member of the intelligentsia and an intellectual?\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s a very big difference,\u0027 he replied. \u0027I can only try to explain it allegorically. Do you understand what that means?\u0027\n I nodded.\n \u0027When you were still very little, there were a hundred thousand people living in this city who were paid for kissing the ass of a loathsome red dragon - which you probably don\u0027t even remember . . .\u0027\n I shook my head. Once in my young days I really had seen a red dragon, but I\u0027d already forgotten what it looked like - the only thing I could remember was my own fear. It was unlikely that Pavel Ivanovich had that incident in mind.\n \u0027Of course, those hundred thousand people hated the dragon, and they dreamed of being ruled by the green toad who fought against the dragon. So, anyway, they came to an arrangement with the toad, poisoned the dragon with lipstick that they got from the CIA and started living a new life.\u0027\n \u0027But what have the intell -\u0027\n \u0027Wait,\u0027 he said, raising his hand. \u0027At first they thought that under the toad they would be doing exactly the same as before, only they\u0027d get ten times as much money for it. But it turned out that instead of a hundred thousand ass-kissers there was only a demand for three professionals working in three eight-hour shifts to give the toad a never-ending royal blowjob. And which of the hundred thousand those three would be, would be decided by an open competition, in which candidates would not only have to demonstrate their advanced professional skills, but also the ability to smile optimistically with the corners of their mouths while they were at work . . .\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve lost the thread.\u0027\n \u0027Well, this is the thread. Those hundred thousand people were called the intelligentsia. And those three are called intellectuals.\u0027\n I have one quirk that is rather hard to explain. I can\u0027t stand it when anyone uses the word blowjob in my presence - outside the context of work, at least. I don\u0027t know why, but it just drives me wild. And in addition, Pavel Ivanovich\u0027s explanation seemed like such a crude, boorish hint at my own profession that I even forgot about the additional fee I\u0027d been planning to ask for.\n \u0027Are you talking about a blowjob so that I can understand? On the basis of my experience of life?\u0027\n \u0027Of course not, my dear,\u0027 he said patronizingly. \u0027I explain things in those terms because then I start to understand the point myself. And the point here is not your experience of life, but mine . . .\u0027\n The next time he started reading a magazine during his flogging. That was insulting enough. But when he started prodding the article with his finger and muttering, \u0027Why don\u0027t you just keep your mouth shut, you bastard,\u0027 I began to get annoyed and interrupted the procedure, that is, I planted the suggestion of a pause in his mind.\n \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 he asked in surprise.\n \u0027Tell me, are we doing a flagellation here, or is this a library day?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, darling,\u0027 he said, \u0027this interview\u0027s outrageous. It\u0027s absolutely incredible!\u0027\n He slapped his fingers down on the magazine.\n \u0027I\u0027ve got nothing against detective novels, but I can\u0027t stand it when the people who write them start explaining how we ought to arrange things in Russia.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s just like some underage prostitute who\u0027s been given a lift by a long-distance truck driver so she can give him a blowjob suddenly stops work, looks up and starts giving him instructions about how to flush the carburettor in a frost.\u0027\n Pavel Ivanovich clearly didn\u0027t understand just how insulting that sounds in a conversation with a sex worker. But I became aware of my upsurge of rage before it overwhelmed me, so that my soul was immediately flooded with a calm joy.\n \u0027What\u0027s wrong with that?\u0027 I asked in a perfectly natural voice. \u0027Maybe she\u0027s serviced so many truckers that she\u0027s picked up all the subtle points and now she really can teach him how to flush his carburettor.\u0027\n \u0027Darling, I pity the kind of truck drivers who need to take advice from an underage blowjob provider. They won\u0027t get very far.\u0027\n \u0027An underage blowjob provider\u0027 - that was what he said. Why, what a . . . I caught another outburst of fury in the very instant it began, and stopped the anger before it could manifest itself.\n This was great. It was like jumping on to a surfboard during a storm and coasting along over the waves of destructive emotions that can\u0027t even touch you. If only it had always been like this, I thought, so many people would have lived longer lives . . . I did-n\u0027t argue with Pavel Ivanovich about the substance of what he said. It\u0027s best if we foxes who follow the Supreme Tao don\u0027t have any opinions of our own on such matters. But one thing was clear: Pavel Ivanovich was an invaluable exercise machine for training the spirit.\n Unfortunately, I realized too late that the load was too heavy for me. The first time I lost control it didn\u0027t lead to any injuries. I was driven wild by a phrase about Nabokov (not to mention the fact that he had a photocopy of an article entitled \u0027The appearance of the hairdresser to the waiters: the phenomenon of Nabokov in American culture\u0027 lying on his desk).\n I had loved Nabokov since the 1930s, ever since I used to get hold of his Paris texts from highly placed clients in the NKVD. What a breath of fresh air those typed pages were in Stalin\u0027s gloomy capital! I remember I was particularly struck by one place in the \u0027Paris Poem\u0027, which I didn\u0027t come across until after the war:\n Life is irreversible -\n It will be staged in a new theatre,\n In a different way, with different actors.\n But the ultimate happiness\n Is to fold its magic carpet\n And make the ornament of the present\n Match the pattern of the past . . .\n Vladimir Vladimirovich wrote that about us foxes. That\u0027s exactly what we do, constantly folding the carpet. We watch the endless performance played out by bustling human actors who behave as if they were the first people ever to perform on the stage. They all die off with incredible speed, and their place is taken by the new intake, who begin playing out the same old parts with the same old pomposity.\n Of course, the scenery keeps changing, sometimes far too much. But the play itself hasn\u0027t changed for a long, long time. And since we can remember more exalted times, we are constantly tormented by a yearning for lost beauty and meaning, so those words touched many strings at once . . . And by the way, that carpet from \u0027Paris Poem\u0027 was later inherited by Humbert Humbert:\n Where are you riding, Dolores Haze?\n What make is the magic carpet?\n I know what make it is. It was woven in Paris on a summer day sometime around 1938, under gigantic white clouds frozen in the azure heavens, and it travelled to America in a roll . . . It took all the abomination of the Second World War, all the monstrosity of the choices that it dictated, for that carpet to be hung up in Humbert\u0027s reception room . . . and then this scholar of the humanities blurts out:\n \u0027Happiness, my darling, is such a contradictory thing. Dostoevsky questioned whether it was permissible if it was paid for by a child\u0027s tear. But Nabokov, on the other hand, doubted whether happiness could ever be possible without it.\u0027\n I couldn\u0027t tolerate a vile insult like that to a dead writer and threw the whip down on the floor. I mean I didn\u0027t just stop making Pavel Ivanovich think he was being flogged, I made him see the whip hit the floor so hard that it left a dent in the parquet. I had to scrape it out afterwards by hand, when he went to the shower. I always avoid arguing with people, but this time I just exploded and started talking seriously, as if I was with another fox:\n \u0027I feel insulted when someone confuses Nabokov with his characters. Or calls him the godfather of American paedophilia. That\u0027s such a profoundly mistaken view of the writer. Remember this - Nabokov isn\u0027t speaking for himself when he describes the forbidden charms of a nymphet at such length. He speaks for himself when he describes in meagre terms, in the very merest hint, the impressive financial resources that allow Humbert to freewheel round America with Lolita. A writer\u0027s true heart speaks out very furtively . . .\u0027\n I remembered where I was and stopped. I took Lolita\u0027s story very personally and very seriously. For me Dolores Haze was a symbol of the soul, eternally young and pure, and Humbert Humbert was the metaphorical chairman of this world\u0027s board of directors. Apart from that, in the line of verse describing Lolita\u0027s age (\u0027Age: five thousand three hundred days\u0027) it was enough to replace the word \u0027days\u0027 with \u0027years\u0027 and it would more or less fit me. Naturally, I didn\u0027t share that observation with Pavel Ivanovich.\n \u0027Go on, go on,\u0027 he said in amazement.\n \u0027Of course, what the writer was dreaming about wasn\u0027t a green young schoolgirl, but the modest financial security that would allow him to catch butterflies in peace somewhere in Switzerland. I see nothing shameful in such a dream for a Russian nobleman who has realized the vanity of the heroic feat of a human life. And the choice of subject for the book intended to provide that security offers less insight into the secret aspirations of his heart than what he thought about his new fellow-countrymen and just how indifferent he was to what they thought about him. And the fact that the book turned out to be a masterpiece isn\u0027t hard to explain either - talent is hard to conceal . . .\u0027\n As I concluded this tirade, in my own mind I cursed myself, and with good reason.\n I\u0027m a professional impersonator of an adolescent girl with big innocent eyes. Creatures like that don\u0027t utter long sentences about the work of writers from the last century. They talk simply in monosyllables, mostly about material, visible things. And now . . .\n \u0027Well, didn\u0027t you get carried away,\u0027 Pavel Ivanovich muttered in astonishment. \u0027Eyes blazing, eh? Where did you pick up all that stuff?\u0027\n \u0027Here and there,\u0027 I said in a morose voice.\n I swore a solemn oath to myself never to get into an argument about culture with him again, but only to exploit him for his proper purpose, as a gymnastic apparatus for developing my spiritual strength. But it was too late.\n In modern society it is fatal to give way to social instincts acquired in other times, and in a culture that was very dissimilar. They\u0027re like gyroscopes trained on a planet which was blown to bits: it\u0027s best not to think where the course they indicate might lead to.\n The people who lived in ancient China were highly spiritual. If I\u0027d demonstrated that kind of knowledge of the classical canon to any scholar then, he\u0027d have gone into debt in order to reward me with double pay and he would have sent a letter in verse to my home, bound to a branch of plum blossom. Perhaps my old memories had led me to expect something similar when I started talking to Pavel Ivanovich about Nabokov. But the result was quite different.\n The next time we met, Pavel Ivanovich asked me to conduct the session on credit because he\u0027d just bought a refrigerator. He expressed this request in the spirit of a secret accomplice, an old comrade tried and tested in journeys to the heights of the spirit. A poet borrowing a bottle of ink from a colleague might have spoken like that. I couldn\u0027t refuse.\n The new refrigerator took up almost half his kitchen, it looked like the tip of an iceberg that had broken through the side of a ship and smashed into the hold. But nonetheless the captain of the ship was drunk and jolly. I\u0027d noticed a long time before that nothing delights a member of the Russian intelligentsia (Pavel Ivanovich could hardly make the grade as an intellectual) as the purchase of a new electrical household appliance.\n I don\u0027t like drunks, so I was acting a bit sullen. No doubt he put that down to the fact that the session was being conducted on credit, and he wasn\u0027t particularly demanding. We got down to work in silence, like a pair of Estonian yachtsmen who have sailed together for ages: he handed me the tattered knout that he kept in the tennis bag with Boris Becker\u0027s signature on it, got undressed, lay down on the sofa and opened a fresh copy of Expert magazine.\n I guessed that what was going on had nothing to do with his disdainful attitude to my art, or even his love for the printed word. Clearly his contrition before Young Russia coexisted in his heart with other vibes about which I knew nothing, and he hadn\u0027t revealed all of his secrets to me. But I felt no urge to penetrate his inner world beyond the depth that had been paid for, and so I didn\u0027t ask any questions. Everything was going as usual - I was lashing his backside with an imaginary knout, thinking my own thoughts, and he was muttering quietly. Sometimes he would start to groan, sometimes to laugh. It was boring, and I felt like some odalisque in an oriental harem, waving away the flies from her master\u0027s fat carcass with regular sweeps of a fan. Then suddenly he said:\n \u0027Would you believe it, what a name for a lawyer - Anton Drill. How did he manage to survive with that . . . I bet the kids gave him hell in school . . . People with names like that grow up psychological deviants, it\u0027s a fact. They all need help from a psychotherapist. Any expert can tell you that.\u0027\n Of course, I shouldn\u0027t have got involved in the conversation - there was absolutely no point in taking the situation beyond the limitations of our professional relationship. The reason I didn\u0027t hold back is that names are a sore point with me.\n \u0027That\u0027s simply not true,\u0027 I said. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what name anybody has. I have a girlfriend, for instance, and she has a name that sounds very, very crude. So crude you\u0027d laugh out loud if I told you it. It\u0027s almost a swearword, you could say, that kind of name. But she\u0027s a beautiful girl, clever and kind. A name\u0027s not a prison sentence.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps, my dear, you don\u0027t know your friend very well. If her name has an obscene meaning, then it will come out in her life. Just you wait, it will manifest itself yet. Everything depends on the name. There\u0027s a scientific hypothesis that every person\u0027s name is a primary suggestive command that contains the entire script of their life in highly concentrated form. Do you understand what a suggestive command is? Do you at least have some idea about hypnotic suggestion?\u0027\n \u0027In general terms,\u0027 I replied, and mentally lashed him a bit harder.\n \u0027Ooh . . . According to this point of view, there is only a limited number of names, because society only needs a limited number of human types. Just a few models of worker and warrior ants, if I could put it like that. And everybody\u0027s psyche is programmed at a basic level by the associative semantic fields that their first name and surname activate.\u0027\n \u0027Nonsense,\u0027 I said irritably. \u0027No two people in the world with identical names are the same.\u0027\n \u0027Just as no two ants are the same. But nonetheless ants are divided into functional classes . . . No, a name is a serious thing. Some names are like time bombs.\u0027\n \u0027What do you mean by that?\u0027\n \u0027Here\u0027s a real-life story for you. There was a Shakespeare scholar called Shitman who worked in the Institute of World Culture. He was getting along just fine, until one day he decided to learn English so that he could read his author and benefactor in the original . . . And he wanted to go to England - \"to see London and die\" as he put it. He started studying. And after a few lessons he learned what \"shit\" means in English. Can you imagine it? If he\u0027d been a chemistry teacher, for instance, it wouldn\u0027t have been so awful. But for specialists in the humanities words mean a lot, Derrida pointed that out. It\u0027s hard to serve the cause of the beautiful wearing a decoration like that in your buttonhole. He began to feel as if the people in the British Council were giving him queer looks . . . In fact, just then the British Council couldn\u0027t care less about the local Shakespeare specialists, because they were being screwed by the tax police, but Shitman decided it was their personal attitude to him. As you can understand, my dear, when someone looks for confirmation of his paranoid ideas, he always finds it. Anyway, omitting all the sad details, he went insane in a month.\u0027\n By this point I was positively seething with rage. I felt he was trying to insult me, although there were no rational grounds for such an assumption - he couldn\u0027t possibly know my true name. But I remembered that the most important thing was to stay in control. Which I managed to do perfectly well.\n \u0027Really?\u0027 I asked politely.\n \u0027Yes. In the madhouse he wouldn\u0027t talk to anyone, just yelled so the entire hospital could hear him. Sometimes he yelled \"same shit, different day\", sometimes \"same shite, different night\". He obviously hadn\u0027t wasted his time studying English. In the end they took Shitman away in a car with military number plates - the special services needed him, let\u0027s put it that way. And nobody knows what\u0027s become of him now, or if they do know, they\u0027re not telling. So much for a midsummer night\u0027s dream, my little darling. And they say nothing depends on a name. But it does, and how. If your friend has an obscenity in her name, sooner or later her path leads to only one place. It\u0027s the madhouse for her. And by the way, Shitman was lucky, the special forces found a use for him. You must have heard about our madhouses. You can get a blowjob for a cigarette in there . . .\u0027\n Spiritual training using a human irritant is like a game of chance in which everything is staked on the kitty. The winnings are very big. But if you can\u0027t take the heat and you lose control, you lose absolutely everything else too. I could have put up with doing the session on credit, even with his theory of obscene names, if only he hadn\u0027t thrown in that blowjob for a cigarette. I wasn\u0027t prepared for that.\n \u0027Sweetheart!\u0027 Pavel Ivanovich screamed. \u0027Sweetheart, what\u0027s wrong? What are you doing, you snake? Militia! Anybody! Help!\u0027\n When he started calling for the militia, I came to my senses. But it was too late - Pavel Ivanovich had received three lashes that even Mel Gibson wouldn\u0027t have been ashamed of. And even though those three lashes were only hypnotic, the blood that had started running down his back was real. Of course, I regretted what I\u0027d done, but that always happens a second later than it ought to. And anyway, in my heart I played another cunning trick - knowing I would be overwhelmed by repentance at any moment, and adopting the inner stance of a repentant sinner, I said in a final vengeful, voluptuous whisper:\n \u0027That\u0027s for you from Young Russia, you stupid old fart . . .\u0027\n As I review my life now, I find many dark spots in it. But the sense of shame I feel for this is exceptionally keen.\n Many shrines in Asia surprise the traveller by the contrast between the bare poverty of their empty rooms and the multilevel splendour of their roofs - with their upturned corners, precious carved dragons and scarlet tiles. The symbolic meaning here is clear: treasure should not be stored up on earth, but in heaven. The walls symbolize this world, the roof symbolizes the next. Look at the building itself and it\u0027s a hovel. But look at the roof and it\u0027s a palace.\n I found the contrast between Pavel Ivanovich and his \u0027roof\u0027 - the modern Russian term for protection - equally fascinating, even though there was absolutely no spiritual symbolism involved. Pavel Ivanovich was merely a petty philological demon. But the roof over his head . . . But then, all in good time.\n The call came two days after the lashing, at eight-thirty in the morning, too early even for a client with special oddities. The number that lit up didn\u0027t mean a thing to me. I\u0027d been up since four o\u0027clock and already managed to get a lot of things done, but just in case I drawled in a sleepy voice:\n \u0027Hello-o. . .\u0027\n \u0027Adele?\u0027 a cheerful voiced asked. \u0027I\u0027m ringing about your advert.\u0027\n I\u0027d already taken the announcement off the site, but someone could easily have saved it for future reference, clients often do that.\n \u0027Let a girl get some sleep, eh?\u0027\n \u0027Triple rates for short notice. If you\u0027re there in an hour.\u0027\n When I heard the words \u0027triple rates\u0027, I stopped being difficult and wrote down the address. One of my Latin American sisters told me that the Panamanian general Noriega liked to drink whisky non-stop all night long, and early in the morning he would send for one of the six women who he always had around him to have sex - my sister knew this, because she was one of them. But that\u0027s Panama - cocaine and hot blood. For our latitudes such early morning passion was a little bit strange. But I didn\u0027t sense any danger.\n For the sake of speed I took the Metro and in fifty minutes I was already there. The client lived in the quiet centre of town. When I walked into the courtyard of the building I wanted (a tall concrete candle with pretensions to architectural originality), I thought at first that I\u0027d made a mistake and this was the back entrance to some bank.\n There were two guards standing by the metal gates in the wall. They looked at me in glum incomprehension and I showed them the piece of paper with the address on it. Then one them of nodded towards an unobtrusive porch with an intercom on it. I walked up to the intercom.\n \u0027Adele?\u0027 the voice in the speaker asked.\n \u0027In person.\u0027\n \u0027Come up to the first floor, the last door,\u0027 said the intercom. \u0027You\u0027ll see when you get here.\u0027\n The door opened.\n It didn\u0027t look much like a block of flats. There wasn\u0027t any lift, or any real stairway either. That is, there was one, but it ended on the first floor, running straight up to a black door with no spy-hole or bell, but with the tiny lens of a TV camera glinting in the wall beside it. As if someone had bought up all the flats from the first floor up and made a single entrance. But that\u0027s a vulgar comparison, owing to the absence of any legitimate culture of large-scale property ownership in Russia. I didn\u0027t have to ring - as soon as I reached the door, it opened.\n Standing in the doorway was a solidly built man of about fifty, dressed like a bandit from the nineties. He was wearing an Adidas tracksuit, trainers and gold - a bracelet and a chain.\n \u0027Come in,\u0027 he said, then turned round and walked back down the corridor.\n It was a strange place that looked like some kind of business premises. One of the doors in the corridor was half open. Through the gap I could see a nickel-plated metal pole that disappeared down through a circular hole in the floor. But the client closed the door and I didn\u0027t get a good look at anything.\n \u0027Come on in,\u0027 he said, letting me past him.\n The bedroom at the end of the corridor looked perfectly civilized, only I didn\u0027t like the smell - it smelled of dog, quite unmistakably, like in some dogs\u0027 love hotel. As well as a bed, the room contained a low coffee table with a drawer and two armchairs. There was a bottle of champagne on the table, with two glasses, and standing beside them was a telephone with a large number of keys and a blue plastic document folder.\n \u0027Where\u0027s the shower?\u0027 I asked.\n The man sat in a chair and indicated the one beside it.\n \u0027Wait, there\u0027s no hurry. Let\u0027s get to know each other first.\u0027\n He smiled paternally, and I decided I must have got stuck with one of those soulful clients. Those men who don\u0027t just want your body for their two hundred bucks, but your soul as well. They\u0027re the ones who really wear you out. To stop a soulful client getting carried away, you have to be morose and unsociable. Let the nice man think the girl\u0027s got adolescent problems. During the period when their personalities are taking shape, teenagers are unsociable and uncommunicative, as every paedophile knows very well. Therefore, that kind of behaviour rapidly inflames a pervert\u0027s lust, which results in a saving of time and is helpful in obtaining better payment for your work. But the important thing here is to shut yourself in the bathroom in good time.\n Some foxes who live in America and Europe take a scientific approach to the use of this effect. That is, they think they take a scientific approach, because they prepare by reading the literature that \u0027reveals the soul of the modern teenager\u0027. They are particularly fond of reading alleged fifteen-year-old authors who specialize in removing the panties from the inner world of their generation with a shy blush on their cheeks. It\u0027s ridiculous, of course. Teenagers don\u0027t have any common internal dimension - just as people of any other age don\u0027t. Each of them lives in his or her own universe, and these insights into the soul of the young generation are simply the market\u0027s simulacra of freshness for the consumer who\u0027s surfeited with anal sex on video, something like the chemical scent of lily-of-the-valley for toilets. A fox who wants to imitate the behaviour of a modern teenager accurately shouldn\u0027t read those books: instead of making you look like a teenager, they\u0027ll turn you into an old theatrical queer acting out a travesty.\n The correct technique is quite different. And like everything that really works, it\u0027s extremely simple:\n 1. In a conversation you should look off to one side, best of all at a spot on the floor about two metres away.\n 2. Never answer what people say with more than three words, not counting prepositions and conjunctions.\n 3. Every tenth utterance, or thereabouts, should break rule number two and be slightly provocative, so that the client doesn\u0027t get the feeling he\u0027s dealing with an imbecile.\n \u0027What\u0027s your name?\u0027 he asked.\n \u0027Adele,\u0027 I said, squinting at the floor.\n \u0027How old are you?\u0027\n \u0027Seventeen.\u0027\n \u0027You sure you\u0027re not lying?\u0027\n I shook my head.\n \u0027Where are you from, Adele?\u0027\n \u0027Khabarovsk, in the Far East.\u0027\n \u0027And how are things back in Khabarovsk?\u0027\n I shrugged.\n \u0027Okay.\u0027\n \u0027So why did you come here?\u0027\n I shrugged again.\n \u0027Just felt like it.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re not very talkative.\u0027\n \u0027Can I go to the shower?\u0027\n \u0027Hang on. We have to get to know each other first. What are we, animals?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sacred-book-of-the-werewolf/page-3.html","bookId":2607,"book":{"id":2607,"title":"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf","description":"Storyline: \n One of the most progressive writers at work today, Victor Pelevin?s comic inventiveness has won him comparisons to Kafka, Calvino, and Gogol, and Time has described him as a ?psychedelic Nabokov for the cyberage.?
