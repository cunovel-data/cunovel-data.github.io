{"id":98217,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u0027It\u0027s two hundred dollars an hour.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll bear that in mind,\u0027 he said. \u0027Doesn\u0027t it disgust you doing this kind of work, Adele?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have to eat.\u0027\\n\\n He picked the folder up off the table, opened it and spent a while looking at it, as if he were checking some kind of instructions. Then he closed it and put it back on the table.\\n\\n \u0027And where do you live? Are you renting a place?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027Uhu.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how many of you are there in the flat, apart from the madam? Five? Ten?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That depends.\u0027\\n\\n At this stage the ordinary pervert would already have reached boiling point. And it looked like my employer wasn\u0027t too far away from it either.\\n\\n \u0027Are you really seventeen, little girl?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, daddy, I am,\u0027 I said, raising my eyes to look at him. \u0027Seventeen moments of spring.\u0027\\n\\n That was a provocative outburst. He snorted in laughter. What I should have done then was to go back to the short, vague phrases. But it turned out he knew how to be provocative as well.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said. \u0027If that\u0027s the way our chat\u0027s going, it\u0027s time for me to introduce myself.\u0027\\n\\n An official ID card appeared on the table in front of me, open. I read what was written in it very carefully, then compared the photograph with his face. In the photograph he was wearing a uniform jacket with epaulettes. His name and patronymic were Vladimir Mikhailovich. He was a colonel in the FSB.\\n\\n \u0027Call me Mikhalich,\u0027 he said with a smirk. \u0027That\u0027s what people who know me well call me. And I hope we\u0027re going to get to know each other very well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To what do I owe the pleasure, Mikhalich?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027One of our consultants complained about you. Apparently you upset him. So now you\u0027ll have to recompensate for it. Or recompense for it. Do you know which is right?\u0027\\n\\n He had a stereotypical appearance: a strong chin, steely eyes, a shock of flaxen hair. But a certain trapezoidal quality in the plebeian proportions of his features made his face look like the West\u0027s cliche of its Cold War opponent. Movie characters of that kind usually drank a glass of vodka and then ate the glass as a snack, muttering through the crunching that it was \u0027an old Russian custom\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027Fuck it,\u0027 I muttered. \u0027A freebee?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 he said, offended, \u0027don\u0027t you confuse the FSB with the pigs. You\u0027ll get your money all right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How many of you are there?\u0027 I asked in a tired voice.\\n\\n \u0027Just one . . . Well, two at the most.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And who\u0027s the other one?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll see in a moment. And don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t cheat you.\u0027\\n\\n He pulled out the drawer of the table and took out a box with all sorts of medical bits and pieces - little jars, cotton wool and a pack of disposable syringes. One syringe was loaded - the bright-red cap on the needle made it look like a cigarette someone has dragged on so furiously that the flame has extended all the way along it.\\n\\n \u0027I not shooting up with you,\u0027 I said. \u0027Not even for quintuple fees.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You fool,\u0027 he said merrily, \u0027who\u0027s going to give you any?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I want the money up front. Who knows what you\u0027ll be like in half an hour?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here, take it,\u0027 he said and threw me an envelope.\\n\\n Members of the Russian middle class often give me dollars in an envelope - the same way they get them when they receive their \u0027unofficial\u0027 salaries. It\u0027s exciting. As if you\u0027ve been raised aloft on the wheel of social insight and offered a glimpse of the intimate linkages in your Homeland\u0027s economic mechanism . . . I opened the envelope and counted the money. The promised triple fee was there, plus another fifty dollars. Effectively the same level of pay as at the National. A client like that ought to be cherished - or at least I ought to pretend to cherish him. I smiled enchantingly.\\n\\n \u0027Okay, if I have to recompense, I\u0027ll recompensate. Where\u0027s the bathroom.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just wait, will you,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ve got plenty of time. Sit tight.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sit tight,\u0027 he repeated and started rolling up his sleeve.\\n\\n \u0027You said there\u0027d be another one. So where is he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just as soon as I shoot up, he\u0027ll be here.\u0027\\n\\n He put a rubber strap round his biceps, then clasped and unclasped his fist several times.\\n\\n \u0027What are we shooting?\u0027 I enquired morosely.\\n\\n I had to know what to prepare myself for.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re taking a ride down the Kashirksy Highway.\u0027\\n\\n I realized the syringe was full of ketamine, an extremely powerful psychedelic that only a psychopath or someone trying to commit suicide would ever inject into a vein.\\n\\n \u0027What, intravenously?\u0027 I asked, unable to believe it.\\n\\n He nodded. I suddenly felt afraid. I couldn\u0027t even stand the ketamine junkies who injected it into the muscle. That stuff had a gloomy kind of effect on them. They became like trolls from beyond the grave, crushed by the weight of some eternal curse - like soldiers in the ghost army in the final episode of The Lord of the Rings. And this guy was about to take it intravenously. I didn\u0027t even know anyone did that. That is, I knew for certain that sane people didn\u0027t do it. A second stiff in less than a month was definitely the very last thing I needed. It was time to clear out.\\n\\n \u0027Listen, why don\u0027t I give you the money back,\u0027 I said, \u0027and we\u0027ll call it a day.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the problem?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s okay for you, you\u0027ll be dead. But they\u0027ll drag me round the courts. I\u0027d better go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said sit tight!\u0027 Mikhalich growled.\\n\\n He got up, went over to the door, locked it and put the key in his pocket.\\n\\n \u0027Get up and you\u0027ll regret it. Understand?\u0027\\n\\n I nodded. He came back to the table, sat down and took a strange device that looked a bit like a Soviet-designed paper-punch out of his medicine box. The device consisted of two semi-circular plates connected by a simple mechanism. There was a large rubber sucker attached to the lower plate, and the upper one was stamped with a star and an inventory number, like a pistol. Mikhalich brought the two plates together, licked the rubber sucker obsessively and stuck the device on his forearm. Then he set the syringe in the gap, carefully introduced the needle into a vein and checked - the liquid in the syringe had turned dark-red. Then he touched a little lever on the strange device, and it started ticking very loudly. Mikhalich frowned as if he was about to take a leap into water, set his feet wide apart, bracing them more firmly against the floor, and pressed the plunger all the way into the syringe.\\n\\n Almost immediately his body went limp in the armchair. For some reason it suddenly occurred to me that that was the way the high priests of the Third Reich had left the world. I listened to the mechanical ticking in alarm - as if it were a bomb that was just about to explode. After a few seconds there was a click, and the paper-punch and syringe sprang off his arm and fell on the floor beside the chair. A small drop of blood appeared in the crook of Mikhalich\u0027s elbow. A clever little invention, I thought. And then it suddenly hit me.\\n\\n I have to explain one thing. I can\u0027t read people\u0027s thoughts. And no one can, because people don\u0027t have anything resembling a printed text inside their heads. Not many people are capable of noticing that ripple of thought that runs incessantly across the mind - even in themselves. So reading somebody else\u0027s thoughts is like trying to make out something written on muddy water by a pitchfork in the hands of a madman. I don\u0027t mean the technical difficulty involved, but the practical value of the procedure.\\n\\n But thanks to our tail, we foxes often find ourselves in a kind of sympathetic resonance with somebody else\u0027s consciousness - especially when that other consciousness is performing an unexpected somersault. It\u0027s rather like the reaction of peripheral vision to a sudden movement in the dark. We see a brief hallucination, a bit like an abstract computer-animated cartoon. This kind of contact is no use for anything at all, and most of the time our minds simply filter out the effect - otherwise it would be impossible to ride in the Metro. Usually it\u0027s weak, but when people take drugs it\u0027s amplified - that\u0027s why we can\u0027t stand drug addicts.\\n\\n When FSB colonels inject ketamine intravenously, strange things happen to them. The \u0027ride down the Kshirsky Highway\u0027 was no metaphor, but a rather realistic description: although Mikhalich\u0027s limp body looked like a corpse, his consciousness was hurtling along some kind of orange tunnel filled with spectral forms that he skilfully avoided. The tunnel kept branching sideways and Mikhalich chose which way to turn. It was like a bobsleigh - Mikhalich was controlling his imaginary flight with minute turns of his feet and hands that were invisible to the eye, not even turns really, simply microscopic adjustments of the tension in the corresponding muscles.\\n\\n I realized that these orange tunnels were more than just structures in space, they were simultaneously information and will. The entire world had been transformed into an immense self-operating program, like a computer program, except that the hardware and the software couldn\u0027t be told apart. Mikhalich himself was an element of the program, but he possessed freedom of movement in relation to its other components. And his attention was moving through the program towards its beginning, towards a hatch behind which there was something terrible lurking. Mikhalich went flying into the final orange tunnel, reached the hatch and resolutely flung it open. And the terrible thing that was behind it burst out and went hurtling upwards - towards the light of day, up into the room.\\n\\n I looked at Mikhalich. He was coming back to life, but in a strange, menacing kind of way. The corners of his mouth were trembling - little spots of either saliva or foam had appeared on them - and I could hear a sound like growling from somewhere in his throat. The growling kept getting louder, and then Mikhalich\u0027s body twitched and arched, and I sensed that in another second the mysterious, terrible power from the bottom of his soul would burst out and be free. I had no time to hesitate - I grabbed the bottle of champagne, swung it hard and hit him on the head.\\n\\n To look at, nothing out of the ordinary happened. Mikhalich slumped down in the chair again, and the bottle didn\u0027t even break. But in his internal dimension, with which I was still in contact, something remarkable took place. The bundle of evil power that was rushing up and out from his inner depths lost control and crashed into a complex combination of thought-forms filling the orange tunnel. There was a flash, with pulsating stars and stripes of flame receding all the way to the horizon like the markings on an infinitely long runway. It was blindingly beautiful and reminiscent of a news report I saw in the 1960s of a trimaran speed-boat that crashed: the speedboat lifted up off the water, performed a slow, thoughtful loop-the-loop and shattered into small fragments against the surface of the lake. Almost the same thing happened this time, only instead of the speedboat it was the lake that was smashed into tiny pieces: the transparent structures filling the orange tunnel fell to pieces and went flying off in all directions with a melodic tinkling sound, fading, shrinking and disappearing. And then the whole universe of orange tunnels went dark and disappeared, as if the electricity lighting it up had been cut off. All that was left was a man lying limply in a chair and a melodic sound that was repeated over and over again until I realized it was the phone.\\n\\n I answered it.\\n\\n \u0027Mikhalich?\u0027 a man\u0027s voice asked.\\n\\n \u0027Mikhalich can\u0027t come to the phone right now,\u0027 I said. \u0027He\u0027s very busy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s that?\u0027\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t think of any short and simple answer. After a few seconds of silence the person on the other end of the line hung up.\\n\\n What a crazy idea that was - to change the name of the KGB. One of the greatest brand names ever was simply destroyed! The KGB was known all over the world. But not every foreigner will understand what the FSB is. One American lesbian who hired me for the weekend kept confusing \u0027FSB\u0027 and \u0027FSD\u0027 all the time. \u0027FSD\u0027 is \u0027female sexual dysfunction\u0027, an illness invented by the pharmaceutical companies in order to launch the production of the female version of Viagra. Sexual dysfunction in women is a bluff, of course: in female sexuality it\u0027s not the physical aspects that are important, so much as the context - candles, champagne, words. And to be completely honest about it, the most important condition for the modern female orgasm is a high level of material prosperity. You can\u0027t solve that with a pill - as Bill Clinton said: It\u0027s the economy, stupid. But I\u0027m digressing again.\\n\\n Although the name of the KGB was changed, the personnel remained the same as before, disciplined and tough. Any normal man would have been out cold for a long time after a blow like that from a bottle. But Mikhalich started to come round quite soon. Perhaps that was because he received the blow in an altered state of consciousness - when the physical properties of the body are transformed, as any alcoholic can testify.\\n\\n I realized he was conscious when I tried to take the key to the door out of his pants. When I leaned down over him, I saw he was looking at me with his eyelids half open. I jumped back immediately. I was frightened by what had happened to him after the injection - I\u0027d never seen anything like that before, and I didn\u0027t want to take any risks.\\n\\n \u0027Phone,\u0027 Mikhalich whispered.\\n\\n \u0027What about the phone?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who . . . who . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who called?\u0027 I guessed. \u0027I don\u0027t know. Some man or other.\u0027 He groaned. Amazing. After a blow like that an ordinary man would have been more concerned about the eternal questions. But this one was thinking about telephone calls. As the Soviet poet Tikhonov wrote, \u0027If we could make nails out of these men, everyone in Russia would have a happier life\u0027 (he later changed this to \u0027there would be no stronger nails in all the world\u0027, but the rough draft was exactly that, I\u0027ve seen it).\\n\\n \u0027Give me the key,\u0027 I said, \u0027it\u0027s time I was going.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wait a bit,\u0027 Mikhalich sighed, \u0027talk.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t talk to junkies.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t get clever . . .\u0027\\n\\n He spoke with an effort, leaving long pauses - as if every sentence were a high mountain he had to climb.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, sure,\u0027 I said in an offended tone. \u0027Don\u0027t get clever. That\u0027s what they said to Liuska too. And then when her client died on the sakura branch, she was arrested. Her lawyer said it was peritonitis, an unfortunate accident. But the investigator stuck the rupture of the colon on her, unpremeditated murder. Bung them three grand, then it\u0027ll be unpremeditated, otherwise you take the full rap. Give me the key, or you\u0027ll get it again. And I don\u0027t give a damn if you are from the FSB. Nothing will happen to me, it\u0027s self-defence.\u0027\\n\\n And at that I picked up the bottle again.\\n\\n He made a sinister sort of sound - like a water sprite laughing somewhere in the depths of his millpond. Then he tried to say something, but all that came out was:\\n\\n \u0027Sit . . . si . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listen, I\u0027m asking you nicely one last time,\u0027 I said, \u0027give me the key!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bitch,\u0027 he said surprisingly clearly.\\n\\n These officers are such boors, you know. They simply can\u0027t talk to a girl in a civilized manner. I raised the bottle to hit him again, and at that point the door behind my back opened.\\n\\n Standing there in the doorway was a tall young man wearing a dark raincoat with the collar turned up. He was unshaven, sullen and very good-looking - I noted that without any kind of personal involvement, with the cold eye of an artist.\\n\\n The only thing that spoiled him a little were the arrogant, angry creases beside his lips. They didn\u0027t actually make me dislike him, though, they just seemed to establish some distance. But even with those arrogant creases he looked very, very attractive indeed. I\u0027d say he was just a little bit like the young Tsar Alexander Pavlovich - as I recall he also had a fierce, wolfish look during the years immediately after he ascended the throne.\\n\\n I was struck by the expression of his face. I don\u0027t know how to explain it. As if someone had been living with toothache for many years and become accustomed to taking no notice of it, even though the pain tormented him every single day. He had the kind of glance that\u0027s hard to forget as well: those greyish-yellow eyes imprinted themselves on your retinas and looked straight down into your soul for a few seconds. But the most significant thing about this face, I thought, was that it was a face from the past. There used to be a lot of faces like that around in the old days, when people believed in love and God, and then that type almost disappeared.\\n\\n We looked into each other\u0027s eyes for a while.\\n\\n \u0027I was going to give him some champagne,\u0027 I said, putting the bottle on the table.\\n\\n The visitor shifted his gaze to Mikhalich.\\n\\n \u0027Brought your daughter, have you?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027Nah,\u0027 Mikhalich croaked from his armchair and even moved his arm (evidently the presence of the visitor had helped him to gather his wits). \u0027Nah . . . the whore . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said the visitor and looked back at me. \u0027So this is the one . . . who offended our consultant?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what happened to you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Boss,\u0027 Mikhalich mumbled in reply, \u0027the tooth, boss! Anaesthetic!\u0027\\n\\n The young man sniffed at the air and a grimace of disapproval appeared on his face.\\n\\n \u0027So they used ketamine for your anaesthetic, did they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Boss, I . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Or did you call the vet in to have your ears docked?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Boss . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Again? I can understand it, out on the job. But why here? Didn\u0027t we have a talk on the subject?\u0027\\n\\n Mikhalich lowered his eyes. The young man glanced at me and it seemed to me his glance was curious.\\n\\n \u0027Boss, I\u0027ll explain,\u0027 said Mikhalich. \u0027Word of . . .\u0027\\n\\n I could physically feel what an effort the words were costing him.\\n\\n \u0027No, Mikhalich, I\u0027ll do the explaining,\u0027 said the visitor. He picked up the bottle of champagne off the table and hit Mikhalich over the head with it with all his strength.\\n\\n This time the bottle broke and a geyser of white foam washed down over Mikhalich from his head to his toes. I was quite certain that after a blow like that he would never get up out of the armchair again - I know a thing or two about human anatomy. But to my amazement, Mikhalich just shook his head from side to side, like a lush who\u0027s had a bucket of water thrown over him. Then he raised his hand and wiped the spatters of champagne off his face. Instead of killing him, the blow had brought him round. I\u0027d never seen anything like it before.\\n\\n \u0027All right, then,\u0027 said the young man, \u0027take a shower, then get in a taxi and go home. They can give you light broth. Or strong tea. But really Mikhalich, to do things right you ought to go on a barbiturate drip.\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t understand what that phrase meant.\\n\\n \u0027Yes sir,\u0027 said Mikhalich. He struggled to his feet and staggered into the bathroom, leaving a trail of champagne drops behind him. When the door closed the young man turned to me and smiled.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s stuffy in here,\u0027 he said. \u0027Please allow me to show you out into the fresh air.\u0027\\n\\n I liked his polite manner.\\n\\n We went out of the flat a different way. The steel pole I\u0027d seen in one of the rooms turned out to lead to the ground floor. You see similar poles in fire stations and go-go bars. You can slide down a pole like that to a big beautiful fire engine and receive a medal \u0027for bravery at the scene of a fire\u0027. Or you can rub your bottom and your breasts against it erotically and receive a few moist banknotes from the audience. So many different roads through life lie before us . . .\\n\\n Fortunately, today I didn\u0027t have to do either of these things. Beside the pole there was a narrow spiral staircase - obviously for less urgent occasions. That was the way we went down, into a dark garage where there was a fantastic black car - an absolutely genuine Maibach. There couldn\u0027t be more than a few of those in the whole of Moscow.\\n\\n The young man stopped beside the car and raised his head - so that his nose was pointed at me - then took a powerful breath in. It looked weird. But after that his face assumed a blissful expression - as if he\u0027d been really moved by something, in fact.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d like to apologize for what happened,\u0027 he said, \u0027and ask you to do me a favour.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What sort of favour?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I need to choose a present for a girl of about your age. I have no idea about ladies\u0027 jewellery and I would be very grateful for some advice.\u0027\\n\\n I hesitated for a second. Generally speaking, in situations like this, you should clear out at the first opportunity - but somehow I felt I wanted to continue the acquaintance. And I was wondering what the interior of the car looked like.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n But the moment I got into the car I forgot all about the interior - I was so struck by the pass on the windscreen.\\n\\n I\u0027d noticed a long time before then that the Russian authorities had a certain tendency towards kitsch: they were always attempting to issue themselves a charter of nobility and pass themselves off as the glorious descendants of empire with all its history and culture - despite the fact that they had about as much in common with the old Russia as some Lombards grazing their goats amid the ruins of the Forum had with the Flavian dynasty. The pass on the Maibach\u0027s windscreen was a fresh example of the genre. It had a gold double-headed eagle, a three-digit number and the inscription:\\n\\n Lo and behold, this sombre carriage\\n\\n Can travel everywhere in this town\\n\\n A. S. Pushkin\\n\\n What can I say? Okay, an eagle. Okay, Pushkin. (I think it was a quotation from A Feast in the Time of Plague.) But the feeling of pride in our great country that the FSB copywriters had been counting on failed to materialize. The problem was probably a wrong choice of period for the references. They should have gone for feudal chronicles, not imperial eagles.\\n\\n \u0027What are you thinking about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah? Me?\u0027 I said, coming to my senses.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027When you think, you wrinkle up your little nose in a very touching sort of way.\u0027\\n\\n We were already driving along the street.\\n\\n \u0027By the way, we haven\u0027t introduced ourselves yet,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Alexander. You can call me Sasha. I\u0027m Sasha Sery.\u0027 That was interesting - \u0027sery\u0027 is the Russian word for \u0027grey\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027And what\u0027s your name?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Adele.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Adele?\u0027 he asked, opening his eyes wide. \u0027You\u0027re not joking?\u0027\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n \u0027Incredible. There\u0027s so much in my life that\u0027s linked with that name! You can\u0027t even imagine. Our meeting like this is fate. It\u0027s no accident that you\u0027ve ended up in my car . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you have a fishing reel with you?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027A fishing reel? What for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can wind me on to it after you finish stringing me along.\u0027\\n\\n He laughed.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t believe me? About Adele?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027I can explain what it\u0027s all about. If you\u0027re interested.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am.\u0027\\n\\n And I really was interested.\\n\\n \u0027Do you know that game on PlayStation - Final Fantasy 8?\u0027\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n \u0027I got almost all the way through it once - and that takes a long time. And then just before the end the enchantress Adele appeared. Very beautiful, a lot taller than a man.
