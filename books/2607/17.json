{"id":98230,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"That\u0027s a fine little phrase - \u0027he growled quietly, but didn\u0027t say anything\u0027. But that\u0027s the way it was. Trying not to startle him, I lowered my jeans, freed my tail and . . . Ah, what an evening that was! Never before had we plunged so deep into the abyss. During our previous erotic hallucinations I had always remained conscious of what was happening and where. But this time the feelings were so intense that there were moments when I completely lost all idea of who I really was - a Hong Kong woman with the Russian name Su, or a Russian fox with the Chinese name A Hu-Li. There were several occasions when I felt genuinely afraid, as if I\u0027d bought a ticket for a roller-coaster that was too fast and too steep. The reason for this lay in Alexander - the hypnotic fluence that emanated from him now was so powerful that I was unable to resist it. If only for a short while, I myself fell victim to suggestion and became completely immersed in the illusion. Once he bit me gently on the lobe of my ear and said: \u0027Don\u0027t scream.\u0027 I hadn\u0027t even realized I was screaming . . . In short, it was a total blast. I realized now what our clients went through every time we put our tails to work. People had good reason to be wary of us. On the other hand, if I\u0027d known what far-out feelings we gave them, I would have charged at least twice as much. When it was all over, I was left lying beside him on the bamboo mat, gradually coming round. It felt like I had pins and needles all over my body - I had to wait for the circulation to restore itself. Eventually I felt strong enough to speak. By that time he had already become human. \u0027Did you like it?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Not bad. Good surveillance work. I mean, camera work. And the director\u0027s no slouch either.\u0027 \u0027No, I didn\u0027t mean the film.\u0027 \u0027What did you mean then?\u0027 he asked, raising one eyebrow. I realized he was feeling more cheerful. \u0027You know what, Sasha, you know what.\u0027 \u0027If you mean you know what, then I liked the song a lot. Let\u0027s put it on again, shall we?\u0027 \u0027Which song exactly?\u0027 \u0027About the bandit Los Dios.\u0027 I wrinkled up my forehead. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s got this name in it,\u0027 he said in a slightly embarrassed voice. \u0027Maybe this Los Dios is not a bandit, I just thought so for some reason.\u0027 \u0027Bandit Los Dios? Where\u0027s that? Ah, I understand: \"Y asi pasan los dias y yo desperando . . .\" That\u0027s Spanish. \"And so the days pass by, and I am in despair . . .\"\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027Yes. I can see now how people get prison terms in this country.\u0027 \u0027Just can\u0027t help teasing, can you,\u0027 he said amiably. \u0027So are we going to put it on? Or maybe we should watch the whole film again?\u0027 The next day we watched the film again, then again and again. And every time that maelstrom reduced my soul to the same sweet desolation as the very first time. We lay side by side for a long time, resting. We didn\u0027t talk, there was nothing to talk about, and we had no strength left. I liked to put my feet on him when he curled up into a big, black doughnut - sometimes he growled for effect, but I knew that he liked it just as much as I did. How fondly I recall those days now! It is wonderful when two beings find a way to bring each other happiness and joy. And what a prude you have to be to condemn them for not being like everybody else! How many of those blissful moments were there, when we lay on the bamboo mat, relaxing, unable even to move? I think they add up to infinity. On every occasion, time simply disappeared, and we had to wait for it to work back up to its usual speed. How wisely life is arranged, I used to think in lazy contentment, as I listened to Nat King Cole singing our favourite song. He used to be so big, grey and rough. He was going to devour the sun. And he probably would have. But now there was a placid black dog lying at my feet, calm and quiet, and asking me not to tease him. Behold the ennobling influence of the female guardian of hearth and home. Such was the beginning of civilization and culture. And I had never even suspected that I could find myself playing this role. Ah, dear Sasha, I used to think, you\u0027ve never mentioned it. And I can\u0027t bring myself to ask about it . . . But you don\u0027t miss your old life as a wolf - so lonely and rootless, do you? You\u0027re happier with me than on your own - aren\u0027t you, darling? Eh? ... Y tu, tu contestando: Quizas, quizas, quizas . . . I often wondered what sort of dog this was, as far removed from a wolf as a wolf from a fox. There were numerous mythological parallels, but I myself had never come across such a strange variety of were-creature. This blue-black canine seemed to be an inoffensive creature, but I had a gut feeling that there was some terrible secret concealed within him. The truth eventually emerged by accident. The day had begun with a slight quarrel. We went out into the forest for a walk and sat down on a fallen tree, and I decided to amuse him by singing Li Bo\u0027s old Chinese song \u0027The Moon Above the Mountain Frontier Post\u0027. I actually sang it quite well only, perhaps, in too high a voice - in ancient China that was prized especially highly. But my skill took a tumble at the cross-cultural barrier - when I\u0027d finished singing, he shook his head and muttered: \u0027How did a Russian officer ever end up living like this?\u0027 I was so offended I could feel myself flush. \u0027Don\u0027t give me that, what kind of Russian officer are you? You\u0027re the captain of the hitmen\u0027s brigade.\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t kill anybody who\u0027s innocent,\u0027 he said icily. \u0027And who was it that sent the Shakespeare specialist Shitman to his death? Do you think no one knows?\u0027 \u0027What Shakespeare specialist Shitman?\u0027 \u0027And you don\u0027t even remember? The one who used to do blowjobs for a cigarette . . .\u0027 \u0027Listen, I reckon you\u0027ve got psychological problems. First you have a fish head working as a bear, and then some Shitman dies, and I\u0027m to blame for everything.\u0027 \u0027I just wanted to say that I know what you were doing at work. Yet I still love you.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the root of all my problems,\u0027 he said in a low voice. \u0027That you love me.\u0027 I couldn\u0027t believe my ears. \u0027What? Just you say that again!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m joking, I\u0027m joking,\u0027 he said hastily. \u0027You\u0027re always joking, so I thought I\u0027d try it.\u0027 The terrible thing was that what he\u0027d said was absolutely true. And we both realized it. There was a heavy silence. \u0027And we didn\u0027t send Shitman to his death, we sent him to glory,\u0027 he said after a minute. \u0027And don\u0027t you go besmirching his memory.\u0027 He was right, we had to change the subject. \u0027You mean to say he knew?\u0027 I asked. \u0027He must have, with some part of his mind.\u0027 \u0027So you have nothing to reproach yourself with?\u0027 Alexander shrugged. \u0027In the first place,\u0027 he said, \u0027we have his application, the one he wrote in the insane asylum: \"I want to see London and die\", dated and signed. And in the second place, we had an expert consultation on the humanitarian aspect. The consultant said everything was okay.\u0027 \u0027Was that Pavel Ivanovich?\u0027 I guessed. Alexander nodded. \u0027How did he ever come to work for you? Pavel Ivanovich, I mean.\u0027 \u0027He felt it was important for him to let us know about his repentance. A strange business, of course, but why turn a man away? Especially if his repentance is sincere. We always need information, you know - about cultural stuff, so we can tell who\u0027s with us and who isn\u0027t. And humanitarian consultations as well. So he became part of the team . . . Okay, let\u0027s drop it. Shitman\u0027s in God\u0027s hands now. That\u0027s if the Imams are telling the truth, of course.\u0027 After that we didn\u0027t say a single word to each other all day until the evening - I was sulking with him and he was sulking with me: both of us had said enough. In the evening, when he was fed up with the silence, he started asking me the clues for a crossword. That evening he was in his human body, and that made the room feel especially cozy. I was lying on a bamboo mat under a lamp and reading another of Stephen Hawking\u0027s books - The Theory of Everything (no more and no less). Alexander\u0027s questions distracted me from my reading, but I answered them patiently. I found some of them even more amusing than the book. \u0027What\u0027s the right spelling - hynaecological or gynaecological?\u0027 \u0027Gynaecological.\u0027 \u0027Gynaecological. Then it all fits. And I thought there was an \"h\" at the beginning.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s because subconsciously you think of women as hyenas. \u0027 \u0027That\u0027s not true,\u0027 he said, and suddenly started laughing. \u0027Well, look at that . . .\u0027 \u0027Now what have you got there?\u0027 \u0027Gynaecological stomatology.\u0027 \u0027What - \"gynaecological stomatology\"?\u0027 \u0027There are two words in a line in the crossword. \"Gynaecological\" and \"stomatology\". If you read them together, it\u0027s funny.\u0027 \u0027You only think it\u0027s funny because you\u0027re ignorant,\u0027 I said. \u0027But that particular culturological concept actually exists. There\u0027s an American writer called Camille Paglia. She had this . . . No, it\u0027s not that she had one herself. Let\u0027s put it this way, she operates with the concept of the \"vagina dentata\". The vagina with teeth is a symbol of the formless, all-consuming chaos that opposes the Apollonian male principle, which is typified by the urge towards formal precision.\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 he said. \u0027Where from?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve read about that. Lots of times.\u0027 \u0027In Camille Paglia?\u0027 I asked, incredulous. \u0027Nah.\u0027 \u0027Where then?\u0027 \u0027At the FSB Academy.\u0027 \u0027Counter-brainwashing?\u0027 \u0027Nope.\u0027 \u0027Then where exactly?\u0027 I persisted. \u0027In the wall newspaper,\u0027 he said reluctantly. \u0027It had a humour section called \"smiles of all latitudes\", and there was this joke in it: \"What\u0027s scarier than an atom bomb? A cunt with teeth.\"\u0027 I\u0027d been expecting something of the sort. \u0027But why lots of times?\u0027 \u0027The wall newspaper was never changed in three years.\u0027 \u0027Okay,\u0027 I said. \u0027I get the picture.\u0027 Evidently my tone of voice must have stung him. \u0027Why do you always have to reproach me for my ignorance,\u0027 he said irritably. \u0027Of course, you know more about all these \"discourses\" than I do. But I\u0027m no knucklehead either, you know. It\u0027s just that my knowledge is in a different area, it\u0027s practical. Which happens to make it a lot more valuable than yours.\u0027 \u0027It depends how you look at it.\u0027 \u0027Whichever way you look at it. Supposing I learned this Camille Paglia off by heart. Then what would I do with her?\u0027 \u0027That depends on your inclinations, your imagination.\u0027 \u0027Can you give me even one example of how reading Camille Paglia has helped someone in real life?\u0027 I thought about it. \u0027Yes, I can.\u0027 \u0027Well?\u0027 \u0027I had a client who was a spiritualist. He used to read Camille Paglia to the spirit of the poet Igor Severyanin during his spiritualist seances. And Igor Severyanin used to tell him, through the saucer, that he liked it very much and he\u0027d always suspected something of the kind, only he\u0027d never been able to formulate it. He even dictated a poem: Ah, vagina dentata, this fleeting assignation is strife. Unforgettable is our meeting. Clean and chaste is my life. \u0027There you see,\u0027 he said, \u0027I managed to lead this clean and chaste life perfectly well without any of your gynaecological stomatology, just as a soldier. And I helped my motherland.\u0027 \u0027And she paid you back, the way she usually does.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s not something I need to be ashamed about.\u0027 \u0027Nobody\u0027s going to feel ashamed about it. Haven\u0027t you realized yet what kind of country you are living in?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027And I never will. The world I live in is one I create for myself. By what I do in it.\u0027 \u0027Get you,\u0027 I said. \u0027If your FSB pals could have heard you now, they\u0027d probably give you another medal. So you created this place for us, did you?\u0027 \u0027More like you did.\u0027 I came to my senses. \u0027Yes, I\u0027m sorry. You\u0027re right. Forgive me, please.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 he said, and went back to his crossword. I felt ashamed. I went over, sat down beside him and put my arms round him. \u0027What are we arguing about, Sasha. Let\u0027s have a howl, shall we?\u0027 \u0027Not right now,\u0027 he said, \u0027tonight, when the moon rises.\u0027 I was left sitting there beside him, with my arm round his shoulders. He didn\u0027t say anything. After a minute or two I felt his body trembling slightly. He was crying. I\u0027d never seen him do that before. \u0027What\u0027s happened?\u0027 I asked affectionately. \u0027Who\u0027s upset my little boy?\u0027 \u0027No one,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s just me. Your Camille Paglia\u0027s to blame, with the teeth you know where.\u0027 \u0027But why should she make you cry?\u0027 \u0027Because,\u0027 he said, \u0027she\u0027s got teeth there, and now I\u0027ve got claws there.\u0027 \u0027Where?\u0027 \u0027You know where,\u0027 he said. \u0027When I transform. Like a fifth leg. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to tell you.\u0027 That was when everything became clear - that new secretiveness of his, and that aura of irrational dread that surrounded him when he became a dog. Yes, everything fell into place. The poor thing, how he must have suffered, I thought. Above all, I had to make him feel that he was dear to me even like that - if he couldn\u0027t see it for himself. \u0027You silly thing,\u0027 I said. \u0027So what? Grow a cactus there if you like. As long as your tail\u0027s safe and sound.\u0027 \u0027You really don\u0027t mind?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Of course not, darling.\u0027 \u0027And it\u0027s enough for you . . . You know, what we do?\u0027 \u0027More than enough.\u0027 \u0027Honestly?\u0027 \u0027Well since you\u0027ve brought it up, I\u0027d like to swap places. So that sometimes you can be Su and I can be Chow. I\u0027m always Su.\u0027 \u0027No, I\u0027m sorry, don\u0027t you go trying to turn me into a queer, on top of this business with the claws . . .\u0027 \u0027If you say so,\u0027 I said, \u0027I don\u0027t insist. You asked, and I told you.\u0027 \u0027Are we talking frankly now?\u0027 I nodded. \u0027Then tell me, why haven\u0027t you given me a single blowjob all the times we\u0027ve been in Hong Kong? Because I\u0027m really a black dog?\u0027 I counted up to ten to myself. After all, the fact that I couldn\u0027t stand the word \u0027blow-job\u0027 was my problem, not his - there was no point in taking offence. \u0027So you think you really are a black dog?\u0027 I asked. \u0027No,\u0027 he said, \u0027this black dog thinks that I really am him.\u0027 \u0027And that\u0027s why you\u0027re so rarely human nowadays?\u0027 He nodded. \u0027I don\u0027t even want to be. After all, I\u0027ve got nothing left here, apart from you. Everything\u0027s on that side now . . . And it\u0027s not mine, it\u0027s his. You were right when you said that words just mess with your head. So what about that blowjob?\u0027 I counted to ten again, but I still couldn\u0027t help myself. \u0027Can I ask you please not to use that word in my presence?\u0027 He shrugged and gave a crooked smile. \u0027Now I\u0027m not even allowed to use words. Only you can do that, is that it? You\u0027re always putting me down, Ginger.\u0027 I sighed. When it comes down to it, all men are the same, and they only want one thing from us. And it\u0027s a good thing if they still want that, said one of my inner voices. \u0027Okay, put the movie on. But not from the beginning, from track three . . .\u0027 As always, following our insane and shameless Hong Kong rendezvous we took a long rest. I looked up at the ceiling, at the rough concrete lit by the electric bulb, resembling the surface of some ancient heavenly body. He lay beside me. What a sweetie, I thought, how touching his love is. After all, this is all so new to him. Compared to me, that is. It\u0027s a tough break for the poor boy, with those claws. But I once heard something about a dog with a fifth leg . . . Only what was it exactly? I can\u0027t remember. \u0027Hey!\u0027 he said to me. \u0027How are you doing?\u0027 \u0027Fine,\u0027 I replied. \u0027Did you enjoy that?\u0027 He looked at me. \u0027Honestly?\u0027 \u0027Honestly.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sacred-book-of-the-werewolf/page-17.html","bookId":2607,"book":{"id":2607,"title":"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf","description":"Storyline: One of the most progressive writers at work today, Victor Pelevin?s comic inventiveness has won him comparisons to Kafka, Calvino, and Gogol, and Time has described him as a ?psychedelic Nabokov for the cyberage.?
