{"id":2006,"title":"The Billionaire Wins the Game (Billionaire Bachelors #1)","description":"Storyline: The Billionaire Wins the Game (Billionaire Bachelors #1) Joseph Anderson has decided it\u0027s time for his three successful sons to find brides. Joseph wants grandchildren to fill his mansion, and he wants them immediately. His eldest son, Lucas, is successful in all areas of his life, except love, and Joseph begins matchmaking. He finds Amy Harper and deems her the perfect daughter-in-law. He just needs to get her and Lucas to both realize they\u0027re made for each other. Lucas Anderson is wealthy, sexy, and stubborn. He has no desire to have any woman enter his life, causing chaos, or using his family\u0027s name. Many women have tried, and he\u0027s been successful in finding out who they are beneath their false smiles. Amy Harper was raised in tragic circumstances and doesn\u0027t like pampered, rich men who have been handed everything with a silver spoon. She spent years finishing her education and then received a job with the Anderson Corporation. She instantly doesn\u0027t like her incredibly sexy boss, who is arrogant and thinks every woman should fall at his feet. When Amy becomes pregnant after one reckless night of passion, she\u0027s scared he\u0027ll take the baby and run. Lucas is demanding, and used to getting his way, but Amy has just the right amount of spark to ignite his fuse, and challenges him each step of the way. Lucas\u0027s father, Joseph, and his brothers Alex and Mark, offer laughter, love, and support. With the love of Lucas\u0027s family, who aren\u0027t only rich and successful, but also kind and giving, Amy starts to realize that being wealthy doesn\u0027t make or break a man, and starts to picture the happily ever after she never believed in for herself.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-billionaire-wins-the-game-billionaire-bachelors-1.jpg","author":"Melody Anne","type":"Romance","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":24,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Romance","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
