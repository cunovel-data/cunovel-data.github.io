It was far past time to start the honeymoon portion of the wedding.\\n\\n “It’s time to go. Let’s say goodnight to my parents and run away from here,” he spoke as he took her hand and led her in the direction of his mom and dad. Amy became incredibly scared as he led her towards his parents. This was it. They were going to be alone very soon and she was terrified. She didn’t know how to act as a married woman.\\n\\n She wasn’t worried about sex. They definitely had chemistry together, but she was worried about the before and after sex. Did she kiss him if she felt like it? Did she take his hand in hers? Did she tell him when the baby was kicking so they could share it? Were those things too intimate?\\n\\n In a regular marriage you didn’t need to ask those kinds of questions, but this wasn’t a regular marriage and she didn’t know what was expected of her. It was terrifying.\\n\\n “Mom, dad, thank you so much for the wedding. I know that I didn’t give you enough time and you made it beautiful anyway. We’re leaving now,” he said as he hugged both of his parents.\\n\\n “Thank you both so much. You’re truly amazing parents. I’m very glad to be a part of your family,” Amy added shyly.\\n\\n “My dear, we’re the ones grateful to have you in our lives. Now we finally have the daughter we weren’t blessed with,” Joseph said, grabbing her up in a hug and then passing her over to his wife.\\n\\n “You two have a wonderful honeymoon and we’ll get together for lunch next week. Now that the wedding is over it’s time to prepare for our first grandchild,” Katherine added while hugging her.\\n\\n Amy was so overcome by her amazing in-laws she didn’t know what else to say. Her child would be loved beyond compare and spoiled beyond measure. The love certainly outweighed everything else about the unusual union.\\n\\n “Give us a few minutes to run upstairs and get Amy changed for your departure,” Katherine said, while taking her into the house. Lucas looked as if he wasn’t going to let her go for a minute, until Joseph laughed and then pulled him aside.\\n\\n “She’ll be right back son.” Amy really loved that laughter. She quickly walked up the stairs with Katherine. She was nervous as they entered the bedroom and she saw the beautiful outfit Katherine had purchased for her.\\n\\n “Amy, I know that all of this has been overwhelming for you but I want you to know that I’m very happy to have you in our lives,” Katherine told her, which brought tears to her eyes again.\\n\\n She wanted a mother so badly.\\n\\n “Thank you, Katherine. It’s all happened so quickly,” she replied. She didn’t want to say anything badly about Lucas but at times the man was really overwhelming.\\n\\n “I know my son can be stubborn and a bit hard-headed. He’s been hurt before. When a family’s been given as much as we have, people tend to take advantage of you. Lucas has been with women before who really hurt him. He’d never admit that but a mother can see things that others can’t. You’ll learn all this soon enough,” Katherine told her gently.\\n\\n “I just don’t want him to hate me for thinking I somehow trapped him,” Amy told her, feeling she could be honest.\\n\\n “Oh hunny, you’ve nothing to worry about. Lucas’s growl is far worse than his bite. He’ll make a fine husband. I can already see he worships you and it gives my heart great pleasure to see the way you look at him. Don’t look at me all panicked. I’m not expecting you to blurt out your love for him but I know that you’ll both be fine,” Katherine said. She then pulled Amy close to her again and the two women stood there for several moments hugging.\\n\\n “Thank you again. This all means more than you could ever know,” Amy told her as she wiped away her tears.\\n\\n “You’re the one who should be thanked. I never thought my son would find a woman like you.\\n\\n Now, we’d better get you back downstairs before Lucas comes hunting for you,” Katherine finished. Amy changed quickly into the beautiful blouse and skirt and then the two of them headed back downstairs.\\n\\n Lucas led Amy away from the house amid shouts of goodwill and much birdseed. They made their way to the awaiting limo that was decorated with ‘just married’ across the back. As soon as they were in the backseat together, Lucas pulled her into his arms and again ravished her mouth.\\n\\n She wanted him so badly; she didn’t have a single thought of pushing him away. Her breathing deepened as she tangled her hands in his thick, dark hair, to pull him closer to her. He was pressed tightly against her aching body and she still felt like she couldn’t get close enough to him. Oh, how she loved the man and now he was her husband.\\n\\n Lucas was so hungry for her; there was no way he could hold out until they got to the jet, which was an hour away. He unbuttoned her blouse and stripped her bra off within seconds. Then Amy gasped as he was lavishing her breasts with his hands and lips. He was molding her aching body with a sweet lovers touch. She pressed tighter into his administering, not wanting it to ever stop.\\n\\n Her nipples were peaked in desire from his touch. When his mouth clasped over one rosy tip, she threw her head back and moaned. He switched sides, giving her body the full attention it needed and wanted.\\n\\n She noticed immediately how much more sensitive her body was now that she was pregnant.\\n\\n He’d turned her to molten lava the only other time they’d made love, but this time she felt like she was going to sink right through the seat. She couldn’t get enough of his hands or mouth on her body.\\n\\n When he released her hardened nipple and trailed his mouth down her stomach, which was just barely showing any signs of life within, she began to tremble. He stripped her skirt and scrap of underwear off in one motion and then he was trailing his lips and tongue over the sensitive skin on the insides of her thighs. She couldn’t stay still. She wanted more. She tried pulling him back up her body, but he just looked up at her with smoldering eyes and gave a slight shake to his head.\\n\\n He again began caressing her legs, while his hands ran up and down her stomach, reaching over her breasts and then back down again. Suddenly he was kissing her in the most intimate way a man can kiss a woman. She jerked at the intimate contact and then all thoughts left her and she could do nothing but feel.\\n\\n It took only seconds and she was falling apart, quivering as her body exploded in complete ecstasy. Before she had time to even blink, Lucas was naked and once again kissing her passionately. Her body started burning again in anticipation of their union.\\n\\n He thrust his tongue inside her mouth, then spread her legs apart and suddenly he was deep within her folds. Their breathing was mingled with the sound of her groans, as her body tightened around him.\\n\\n She fell apart a second time, quivering in his arms and that was all it took to send him over the edge. He pushed into her one final time and then fell against her, fully sated. Neither of them talked as their breathing slowly returned to normal.\\n\\n She didn’t want to let him go. She knew once they broke apart, the awkward silence would begin. For now it was just two lovers enjoying the aftermath of what they’d just shared.\\n\\n They were still lying pressed together when the driver announced they would reach their destination in about five minutes, over the car intercom.\\n\\n Amy flushed scarlet, quickly scrambling to get her clothing back in place. “Where’s my bra?” she asked in a panic.\\n\\n Lucas laughed aloud at the horror on her face, at the thought of getting caught naked in the back of a car with her husband.\\n\\n He pulled the bra out from behind him and handed it over to her. She finished dressing in record time and then scooted away from him a bit. Lucas straightened up himself, but knew the clothes would be coming back off in a few minutes. He found it very endearing that his wife was afraid to be caught necking in the back of the car.\\n\\n He’d just finished loving his wife, far too quickly and now wanted to take her again much more slowly and thoroughly. He could already feel his body hardening in anticipation of sinking into her again. He couldn’t understand how he could crave her so quickly after being totally satisfied.\\n\\n They pulled up to the airport where his private jet was awaiting their arrival. Lucas led her inside while the luggage was loaded. “We’ll be taking off in about thirty minutes Mr. Anderson. Is there anything I can get for you two while we are waiting?” Some far too cute and perky blond lady asked them when they were inside.\\n\\n “Yes Lana, thank you, we’ll each have dinner and I’ll take a glass of bourbon.”\\n\\n “What would you like to drink, dear?” He asked Amy.\\n\\n “I would love some milk please,” she simply replied, realizing for the first time she was starving.\\n\\n She loved the term of endearment coming off of his lips. It made her feel like a real wife.\\n\\n “Here’s your drink Mrs. Anderson. Your meal will be out in just a few moments,” the perky flight attendant said as she returned promptly.\\n\\n Amy looked up at her, with a bit of shock. She’d called her Mrs. Anderson. She was Mrs.\\n\\n Anderson. That hadn’t really sunk in. She’d continually thought about the power that name commanded and now she had that name. She was so out of sorts in his world that she didn’t know how she could ever possibly fit in.\\n\\n “How are you feeling?” Lucas asked her.\\n\\n “Really good actually,” she replied. “I forgot to eat today though, so I’m starving. I think I could consume an entire cow right now. Would it be rude for me to ask for two of the little dinners?” she asked him, somewhat embarrassed.\\n\\n Lucas laughed out loud at her question. “We have a full meal prepared for us Amy. I don’t think you will have to worry about being hungry. I’m pretty famished myself. I didn’t get much chance to eat with everything that was going on.”\\n\\n “Here’s your appetizer.” Amy looked down at the plate Lana had set in front of her and her mouth started to water. There were several little things on it sending up the most amazing aromas. Her stomach growled loudly enough for both Lucas and the perfect Lana to hear.\\n\\n “Well you better dig in before my son starts growling some more,” Lucas said and patted her stomach.\\n\\n Amy was so shocked by the intimate moment she again got tears in her eyes. She leaned over and kissed him impulsively. “Your son or daughter,” she stressed with humor, “is just fine. It’s the mommy that could consume everything in sight right now.” She grabbed her fork and moaned aloud at how good it tasted.\\n\\n Lucas sat there enjoying her pleasure for a few moments before starting on his own food. “I will serve your salads after we have taken off,” Lana said and then left them to eat. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-billionaire-wins-the-game-billionaire-bachelors-1/page-19.html","bookId":2006,"book":{"id":2006,"title":"The Billionaire Wins the Game (Billionaire Bachelors #1)","description":"Storyline: The Billionaire Wins the Game (Billionaire Bachelors #1) \\n Joseph Anderson has decided it\u0027s time for his three successful sons to find brides.
