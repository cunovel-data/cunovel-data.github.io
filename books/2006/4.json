I’ll be fine,” she said between clinched teeth. She could tell that wouldn’t be the end of the discussion but she wouldn’t let the man walk all over her, boss or not. Her reply infuriated him. How dare she tell him no when he was offering her a ride! He wasn’t used to anyone defying him and it really pissed him off she would rather ride the bus than accept a ride home from him. Was his company so repulsive to her she couldn’t stand to be in his presence for even a moment longer than she had too? He was already confused enough about how he felt and really didn’t want to say something he would regret so he decided to say nothing else but if she really believed he was going to allow her to ride the bus then she wasn’t as smart as he believed her to be. She may be stubborn but he could certainly outlast her. He was used to people bending over backwards for him. It was a bit of a shock but not all that unpleasant of one to find someone who was willing to argue with him. He found that he liked Amy a bit more each time she challenged him but there was no way the tiny little vixen was going to get her own way that night, not when it was an issue of her safety at hand. He could see she was getting tired but he kept piling work upon her. For one thing he was still angry she refused to ride with him and secondly he just wanted to be in her company. He was used to working late and before he knew it time completely got away from him. “Mr. Anderson, I don’t want to complain but it’s eleven at night. Can I just come in tomorrow if this really needs to get done?” she asked him with fatigue showing. He felt a little guilty he’d let his temper override his good judgment. He would’ve never normally made her stay so late. “We can finish this all up on Monday,” he told her. “Let’s get out of here.” He placed his weekend work in his briefcase and walked with her into her office. He stood by the door while Amy placed her work down and gathered her purse and coat. She glanced up and he could tell she was surprised to see him still standing there. “Okay, Mr. Anderson, I‘ll see you Monday.” She tried to make a quick exit and headed straight towards the elevators, hoping he would forget all about the ride issue. He grinned to himself enjoying the edge to her voice. He found it comical she thought he could so easily be dismissed. Usually women were chasing him all over the place. He liked the cat and mouse game with his new assistant. Amy pressed the elevator button and they both stepped on for the long ride down. Neither of them spoke. He was smiling to himself while she was fighting her irritation. They stepped out of the elevator and walked towards the doors. “Hi Amy, you’re working late tonight. There are no more busses running this late. Would you like for me to call you a cab?” the night guard asked. “That would be great Paul,” she gave him her best smile. “How’s that beautiful little girl of yours doing? Did she make the basketball team?” “Yes she made varsity and has been prancing around the house for two days now. I’ll show you the pictures just as soon as my wife gets them developed,” he continued on. “Good night Mr. Anderson. Have a safe ride home,” he said to Lucas as if just realizing he was there with the two of them. “Paul, Ms. Harper won’t need that cab called. I’ll give her a ride home tonight,” Lucas stated with the confidence of knowing his word would be taken with no questions asked. Paul looked from her rigid face to his boss’s unyielding expression and decided he wasn’t getting in the middle of whatever was going on. “Okay then, enjoy your weekend.” He turned and walked back over to his desk. Lucas pulled Amy through the front doors while gripping her arm. She didn’t want to cause a scene in front of Paul so she went without a struggle but she was going to give Lucas a piece of her mind once they were outside. Of all the obnoxious, arrogant things the man could do. If he felt he could manhandle her and just expect her to go along with it he had another thing coming. As soon as they were outside she turned towards him ready to unleash all her anger that had been building the past few hours. “Look...” she didn’t get to finish. He suddenly pulled her into his arms and crushed his lips to hers. She was so stunned she stood there rigid for about three seconds while his lips stroked hers. Then, she forgot who she was, let alone who he was and melted into his arms. All of the anger and frustration, added to her building attraction for the man, spilled over and she melted in his arms. There were no thoughts of protest or anger anymore. She’d never been knocked off her feet before but there was a first time for everything. Her body was on fire and she never wanted the feeling to stop. Her arms reached around his neck and her lips opened in invitation, allowing him full access to her mouth. His lips softened, caressing instead of bruising. His arms moved up and down her back, molding her body to his. She felt like she couldn’t get close enough. She couldn’t breathe, but she had no need for oxygen. She only needed his body pressed into hers. She only needed his lips to keep working their magic. Her stomach had a million butterflies fluttering around and sparks of electricity shot through her body. Lucas was ready to take her there on the sidewalk. His body and mind were on fire for her. He couldn’t have remembered his own name if someone had asked it right then. He had to have her. He started to lift up the bottom of her shirt, forgetting they were standing on the sidewalk in full view of anyone who cared to walk by. Amy was the first of them to snap back to reality. What was she doing? She was about ready to let her boss take her against the outside wall of the office building. She snapped her head back and pushed him away. Before she knew what she was doing her hand came up and slapped him hard across the cheek. She stood there, breathing heavily, her eyes rounded to twice their normal size. She’d just about made love to her boss against a wall, in public and then she’d slapped him in the face. She could do nothing but stare at him in horror. Lucas couldn’t tell if she was stunned from the kissing, the slapping, or both. She also looked flushed and disheveled. He took a step back so he wouldn’t grab her again. He would gain control of himself because he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she would be his. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to break the spell she had over him until they both caved into the feelings that were coursing through them. “I will allow that one for free, but be ready to face the consequences if you slap me again,” he said, while rubbing his jaw. She had really put some body weight behind the hit, he was thinking. She wasn’t some helpless female who couldn’t hold her own against him. “How dare you,” she spat. “You don’t just go around kissing anyone you feel like. You may be rich and great looking, but you don’t own me. I’m your employee and nothing more.” With those words she spun around and started walking away. She had no idea where she was heading. She just knew that she had to get away from him before she burst into tears. She was completely confused about how she was feeling at that moment and needed a few minutes to clear her head. She took about five steps before Lucas grabbed her arm and spun her around. “I don’t know what kind of a game you’re playing Amy but you gave just as much as you took back there,” he snapped. His body was still on fire and her hot and cold was playing havoc with him. He wanted to throw her down on the sidewalk and take her in one swift move, which shocked the hell out of him. “I’m sorry about that,” she barely got out. “I lost my head for a moment but if you think I took this position so I could sleep with my boss then you have another thing coming. Just forget this night happened. I know I will. I will see you on Monday Mr. Anderson.” She struggled to pull away from his iron grasp. Her words were escalating his temper. It was like she’d thrown a cup of ice cold water in his face. She would forget about what had just happened? Like hell she would. He was close to reminding her once again of their chemistry. Only a lot of years of tightly reigned in self-control prevented him from doing just that. He wouldn’t be forgetting about her anytime soon and he realized that he didn’t want her to forget about him either. He was sorely tempted to call her on her bluff but knew he didn’t have the willpower to stop twice in a few minutes time. The next time he started things they would be somewhere it could be finished and he would make sure that she was an active participant and not a victim. Instead of kissing her he kept pulling her along behind him. She fought him each step of the way but he guessed she knew her words would do no good because she remained silent. He reached his car and clicked the lock. He wasted no time tossing her in the front seat and then walking around to get into the driver’s side. He turned the car on and pulled out of the parking lot. “Where do you live Amy?” She was so seething mad that she had to count to ten in her head before she could speak again. “I told you I didn’t want a ride with you!” she finally spit out. “Well, whether you wanted the ride or not, you got it, so it would be really helpful if you would just tell me where you lived. That is unless you want to just come back to my place and finish what we started back there on the street,” he said. Once again, she had to count silently in her head. She felt trapped between a rock and a hard place. The last thing she wanted was for her extravagant boss to see where she was living. She planned on getting out of there as soon as she had enough money saved up. She thought for a few moments and then gave him an address of a nearby apartment building. She knew that if he really wanted to find her place he was perfectly capable, but on the other hand she didn’t see that he would ever have any reason to go looking for her either, that is after the night finally ended. They pulled up to the apartment complex and she saw a car turn on their backup lights. She knew that she would have to move quickly or he would insist on walking her to the door. He stopped to wait for the car and she jumped out before he could stop her and dashed around the side of the building. She said nothing to him, didn’t even glance back to see his expression. She would assume he was furious with her for getting the upper hand. Once in a while the man surely had to lose a battle, even if she was sure that he always won the war. Amy wasn’t taking any chances and as soon as he was out of her sight she went into a full blown sprint and hid behind some shrubs. She stayed there for much longer than was probably necessary. Finally, when she figured he was gone, she crept out and snuck to the front of the building, peaking around and looking for his car. The coast was clear. She sighed to herself. She had about a two mile walk to get back to her place and the shoes she was wearing were not made for it. Oh well she thought, she may as well get started. She said a silent prayer that she wouldn’t get mugged on the way. The neighborhood wasn’t exactly what you would call family friendly and she was usually not out so late alone.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-billionaire-wins-the-game-billionaire-bachelors-1/page-4.html","bookId":2006,"book":{"id":2006,"title":"The Billionaire Wins the Game (Billionaire Bachelors #1)","description":"Storyline: The Billionaire Wins the Game (Billionaire Bachelors #1) Joseph Anderson has decided it\u0027s time for his three successful sons to find brides.
