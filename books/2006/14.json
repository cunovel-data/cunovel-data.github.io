What he did on his own time was his business, definitely not hers. Lucas was completely professional with her, giving her a list of things he wanted done and then left the office and stayed away the rest of the day. It gave her plenty of time to breathe and she found herself relaxing and finishing her work early. The next few months flew by with things the same at the office. Lucas would give Amy her assignments with very little talk and then leave her alone. He never lingered and never seemed to make eye contact anymore. She’d really gotten the hang of her job and finally felt comfortable with her work. Esther had stopped by several times and praised her progress saying it was as if Amy had been with the company for ten years instead of a few short months. Amy was thrilled by the praise and held the feeling close to her. She felt like her insides were ripping out a little piece at a time whenever Lucas left the room though. His scent would linger with her, causing her physical pain, thinking of him for hours on end. She wanted him to take her back in his arms so badly she ached all over. She would run through their night of love making over and over again. She would wake up in the middle of the night with his name on her lips and her body wet and ready for him. She was grateful he was keeping his distance because she would never have had the will power to push him away if he kissed her again. She had no other man to compare him to but she couldn’t imagine lovemaking to be any better than what she’d had with him that night. Even though she tried so much to put him out of her mind, he came to her nightly in her dreams and she woke up aching and alone. Amy put off taking a pregnancy test for far too long. She knew she was pregnant. She’d been dealing with morning sickness and there were subtle changes in her body. She was naturally small so most wouldn’t have noticed the tiny bump on her lower stomach, but she did. She finally broke down and took the test, then threw it away. She’d already known the answer was yes. She supposed she’d better make a doctor appointment the following week. They were going to find out in a couple of months she was pregnant anyway. At least she had the advantage of doctor, patient confidentiality so Lucas wouldn’t have to find out she was pregnant until she was visibly showing. “Amy it’s dark outside and I’m more than ready for happy hour. Come girl, let’s whisk you away from here,” Tom came bouncing into her office at six. “I’ve been patiently waiting for you for an hour now. You do realize you’re salaried, not paid by the hour?” he added. Tom jumped up on her desk and sat on the edge while she finished her project. “Hold your pants on Tom, I’m almost finished,” she said with what felt like her first real smile in weeks. “Drinks, my dear, are on me tonight,” she said in delight. “I got paid and actually have some money left and I owe you a million lunches and drinks. I intend to pay them all back to you,” she said feeling really great about herself. It was so nice to have money building up in her meager savings account. She only had that money thanks to having very little bills. She was in love with her apartment and car and things were perfect in every way possible. She placed her hand on her stomach, which she did often without even realizing it when she thought of her child growing there. Lucas was in his office with the connecting door cracked and heard the exchange between Amy and Tom. He was surprised by the amount of jealousy he was feeling at how easily she laughed with him. He’d never in his life felt jealousy before and was shocked by the emotion, at how it was tugging at his gut. They couldn’t be a couple. She was his employee and it wouldn’t work. He shouldn’t feel anything towards her at all but even after months he couldn’t stop thinking about her all the time, night and day. He sat up a little bit straighter in his chair. He was going out of his mind, which would amuse his brothers to no end. He laid his head in his hands and waited for her to leave the office. He had no complaints with her work. She’d learned more and more each day and was doing an excellent job. He’d entertained the idea of firing her but had thrown the thought out immediately. He just couldn’t let her go. Maybe he would be able to soon. Of course he would. He would get over his feelings towards her and be able to work with her, like anyone else, or he would have no choice but to figure out something else. Lucas got up and decided to go out for a drink. He would find himself a nice distraction for the night. Any woman would be happy to come home with him. He was Lucas Anderson and never had trouble finding a date. Even though the thought of any other woman besides Amy wasn’t appealing, he would just have to work through it. He knew once he stepped out he would begin to feel better and he was sure that some pretty thing would catch his eye, at least enough for one night. Lucas went to a nice club he hadn’t been to for a while and sat down. He ordered a drink and was there for no more than five minutes when an exceptionally gorgeous redhead sat next to him. She gave him the look that said, buy me a drink and you can take me home. He slammed his drink down before turning to give her his full attention, “can I buy you something to drink?” He placed all the charm at his disposal into his voice. She rubbed her finger up his arm, “that sounds nice sugar,” She replied. He bought her a few drinks and listened to her try and charm him for about an hour. He knew all he had to do was crook his finger and she would be in his car and coming home with him. He was trying to will himself to do just that and knew it wasn’t going to happen. Lucas felt absolutely zero desire for the woman who had curves in all the right places and was showing them for all to see. “Thank you for your company this evening,” he said to her as he threw several bills down on the table. “I need to get going now,” he finished. “In case you haven’t noticed the signals, baby I’m offering to go with you. Trust me, you won’t regret a night or more with me,” she purred. Lucas just looked at her and then turned and walked away. He’d felt nothing for her. Normally he would’ve taken her home and accepted what she was offering. A no strings attached night of great sex. The whole time he’d sat there all he could think of was Amy. She was soft and feminine, not trampy and brash. She was also the greatest sexual experience he’d ever had. How was that woman always so much a part of his thoughts? He parked in his spot, immediately noticing Amy’s rig parked in her place. He was surprised by the feeling of relief washing over him at knowing she was home. Of course, that was short lived as he thought there could be a man up in her apartment with her. Suddenly he had to know. He had to know if she was with someone, or if she was by herself. He knew if he was with her just one more night then he could get her out of his system. He needed to be with her again on his own choosing. He needed to take her again and then maybe he would realize it wasn’t as great as he remembered it being. Suddenly Lucas was in a rush to get up to her apartment. She still hadn’t figured out the other apartment on their floor was his. He’d been very careful about coming and going at different times from her. He hadn’t wanted her knowing he was that close to her. The doors opened and Fred looked up from his paper. “Hello Mr. Anderson. How was your day sir?” Fred asked, as usual. “It was great Fred. Do you know if Ms. Harper’s in her apartment?” he asked, coming right to the point. “Ms. Harper is currently in the pool, sir,” Fred told his boss. “Thank you Fred, have a nice night,” he said, as he quickly turned towards the pool. If she was already swimming, she must’ve only been out for about a half hour. That was a quick night out. He guessed she didn’t have as big of a social life as she wanted him to believe. Or she could be planning to go out later when the real nightlife began. Well, she could put those thoughts on hold, he thought because he’d decided she was spending the night with him. He went into the men’s locker room and quickly grabbed his swim trunks and changed. He was going to surprise his assistant since he’d decided he wouldn’t be spending the night alone. Lucas came out of the locker room and stood unnoticed for several minutes as Amy swam in the pool alone. She looked phenomenal in her swim suit. It showed all her curves off to perfection. He wanted to take her right then, but anticipation was all part of the fun. When she was swimming away from him he dove effortlessly into the pool. He made little noise and Amy didn’t notice his entrance. She turned around and was making her way back towards him. He decided to stay in her lane and anticipated them connecting at any moment. When she reached Lucas, she slammed into him and started sputtering water. “Oh, excuse me,” she said as she started to look up. When she noticed who it was she’d run into she seemed to freeze in place. “What are you doing here?” she stuttered a bit. “I thought tonight was a great time for a swim,” he replied back to her and took off at a fast pace across the pool. Amy stayed there holding on to the edge of the pool, trying to decide if she wanted to finish off her laps or just get out. She was about to get out of the pool, when she decided she wasn’t letting him chase her out early. She started her laps again and finished her set amount. When Amy climbed back out, Lucas was still swimming. She went over to the hot tub, which was a part of her routine. She sat down and let the hot water wash her worries away. Amy knew the moment Lucas joined her in the tub. Her head was back and her eyes were closed, but she could feel him there. She didn’t say a word. She just pretended like he didn’t exist. If he wanted to make her uncomfortable he was doing a great job but she wasn’t going to show it. At least she thought she was doing a great job at not showing it. Her body could hide nothing in her swim suit though. He was eyeing her nipples at the moment and they were pebbled into hard points looking as if they were bursting to break free of the suit. He was more than willing to accommodate her with that. She sat in the tub for a few more moments and then decided enough was enough. The hot water normally eased all the tension away in her body’s sore muscles but she’d sat there tensed and was sorer than when she’d gotten in. She climbed out quickly, wrapping the towel she had nearby around herself. She didn’t turn to say anything to him, just headed off to the locker-room to get changed. She had to get out of there quickly. Lucas was glad she’d decided to get out of the tub. He had to wait for her to leave, because he couldn’t have hid the evidence of how she affected him and he was ready to get her upstairs. He quickly got out of the tub and dressed in record time. He then headed for the lobby and chatted with Fred for a little while. She finally emerged, looking shocked to see him still standing there. She then narrowed her eyes and stomped like a child throwing a temper tantrum to the elevators. “How was the pool, Ms. Harper?” Fred asked her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-billionaire-wins-the-game-billionaire-bachelors-1/page-14.html","bookId":2006,"book":{"id":2006,"title":"The Billionaire Wins the Game (Billionaire Bachelors #1)","description":"Storyline: The Billionaire Wins the Game (Billionaire Bachelors #1) Joseph Anderson has decided it\u0027s time for his three successful sons to find brides.
