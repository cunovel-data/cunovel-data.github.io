I assumed the matter was settled,” he said a bit too harshly.\n “Lucas, don’t you dare use that tone of voice with me. Don’t forget I’ve seen you running around in nothing but a diaper on. You knew that when your father retired I would be leaving as soon as you got settled in. I stayed on to make sure you had a smooth transition but now it’s my turn for retirement. I love this company but like your father sometimes it’s best to get on with things and bring in a new generation.”\n “I’m sorry about the misunderstanding. Can you work one more month so I can find an appropriate replacement to take your position? I will double your salary since I know it’s an inconvenience to you,” he pleaded, trying to forget that Amy was even in the room.\n “Your father already conducted the interviews and Amy’s your new assistant. I’ve been training her all morning and she’s doing a remarkable job,” she finished and patted Amy on the back.\n Suddenly Amy had his undivided attention once again. The minute he turned those eyes back on her she felt her stomach drop. The man had enough heat packed in his eyes to be considered a fire hazard. She’d never reacted so strongly to a man before and wasn’t happy about the unfamiliar feelings flooding through her.\n “I’ll speak to my father about this but I should’ve been informed about the interviews. Don’t get too comfortable in your new position Ms. Harper,” he spoke with the upmost authority, then stormed back through the doorway, shutting it a little bit harder than necessary.\n “I thought he knew that I’d been hired. He didn’t even know you were leaving,” Amy said with apprehension in her voice. She could be losing her dream job before it had even started.\n “Now don’t you worry about anything Amy, everything will be just fine.” They got absorbed in their work and the incident was placed on the back burner, still there, but put away for the moment.\n “Dad, how do you expect me to run this company when you’re stepping in and doing things without letting me know?” Lucas was pacing in front of his father, back and forth across the parlor at his parents’ home.\n “Now son, I told you when I left Esther would be retiring once you got settled in. I also told you I would take care of her replacement. It’s not my fault that you forgot about that. And it’s not Esther’s fault you didn’t take her resignation seriously,” his father said.\n “Dad, I know you’re up to something. I just can’t figure out what it is this time but I’m capable of hiring my own staff,” he spoke with frustration. It was so much harder to argue with the man when he was being reasonable. “It doesn’t exactly look good when the president of the company doesn’t know what’s going on in his own offices,” he finished.\n “Son, I interviewed about thirty people and Ms. Harper was, by far, the most qualified candidate.\n Believe me, you’ll have no problems with her. I checked her out extensively before sending her to you.” Little did his son know that he was actually checking her out as his future daughter-in-law and could care less about her qualifications as an executive assistant, although she’d done very well in school and would most likely do an extraordinary job at the office.\n “Fine, I’ll see how she works out but if she doesn’t work soundly with me then I’ll fire her and the next person will be someone that I find, not you,” he said.\n “Of course Lucas,” his dad quickly agreed. “Now on to other business,” he prompted, before getting back to work. By the time Lucas returned to the office everyone was gone. He could still smell Amy’s scent in the room. He had a feeling her employment wasn’t going to work out. He had the feeling that his new employee was going to be nothing but trouble for him.\n He had a lot of work to do so he walked through their connecting doors into his own office, which made Amy’s new one seem small, if that were possible. He sat back on his couch and started reading a file, falling asleep before he knew it. That wasn’t unusual. He slept at the office as much as he did in his own home.\n Lucas’s brothers would mock him growing up, saying he was a sixty year old man in a teenager’s body. He didn’t care if they teased him. He had goals and responsibilities and if that meant he wasn’t into the stuff most teenagers were into, then so be it. Look at where he was now.\n He was the head of a company respected throughout the world and had more than most people could even dream of.\n Amy stepped off of the elevator feeling pretty good. What a difference from her first ride up such a short time ago. The month had flown by and she was doing well at her job, if she did think so herself.\n “Amy, come on over and have some cake,” she heard Esther calling. “It’s my retirement party.” Amy looked up to find hundreds of people crowded around the front office. Everyone was chattering and eating cake.\n “Amy dear, how are you doing?” This came from Joseph Anderson. He walked up and threw an arm around her shoulders.\n “It’s great Mr. Anderson. Thank you again for giving me this opportunity.” She added bashfully, not knowing what else to say.\n “Nonsense my girl, you earned this position. Esther said you are fitting right in and doing a fantastic job.” He laughed heartily.\n “Now come with me. There’s someone I want you to meet.” He wrapped her arm in his and dragged her across the room.\n “Mike, I want you to meet Amy. She’s the new executive assistant for Lucas,” he said in an excessively loud voice, which had several heads turning towards them. Amy could feel her face grow warmer as she didn’t like to be the center of attention.\n “Nice to meet you Amy,” Mike replied.\n “I will just leave the two of you to chat for a while,” Joseph said with a chuckle while walking away. Amy stayed and chatted with Mike, finding his company pleasant.\n Mike was far more the kind of man who normally interested Amy. He was average looking, not someone you would place on a calendar, but someone you would definitely give a second glance.\n He had a sense of humor and kept up a witty conversation. He was safe.\n Amy almost wished she was searching for a relationship, as Mike seemed the kind of man who would be pleasant to date. He wasn’t arrogant and he didn’t seem to be demanding. Oh well, she sighed to herself, letting the thought pass.\n Across the room Lucas was glaring daggers at his new employee. She never smiled that way when he talked to her. Of course, he was normally barking orders at her. He still didn’t like the attention she was giving to another male and he really didn’t like the interest he saw in Mike’s eyes. As Lucas slowly looked her up and down he could understand that interest.\n What did his father think he was doing, introducing her to Mike? Everyone knew he went through women faster than he changed clothing. Many women had been fooled by his act of affection but Lucas knew the guy only had one goal in mind and Lucas was sure that Amy wasn’t ready for the consequences of a failed office romance.\n Lucas was even more irritated he cared. He consoled himself by thinking he was only concerned because if she got discarded her work performance would suffer, which would make him have to fire her. He would then have to take time away from his busy schedule to hire a new employee.\n He was just about ready to storm over there, grab her arm and drag her away when his father approached him. “How you doing boy?” he asked far too slyly.\n “Fine Father and you?” he automatically responded, not taking his eyes off of Amy.\n Joseph was thinking that his plan was coming along just fine. His son was falling for Amy quickly and he didn’t even realize it. Joseph may as well push things along a bit more and help speed things up. In the game of love no one could lose.\n “Don’t you think Amy and Mike look good together? She’s seemed a little lonely this past week,” he said.\n “Mike’s a cad. I’m going to put a stop to this. You need to quit meddling in people’s lives Father,” Lucas said angrily.\n “I’m sorry Lucas. I didn’t know you were interested in her. You know a boss shouldn’t have a romance with his employee,” he added. He knew his son well. There was nothing he enjoyed more than a challenge.\n “I’m not interested in her,\" Lucas said, not fooling his father in the least. “I just know what kind of a man Mike is. He’ll break her heart and then her work will be affected. I’m only thinking of the work environment.” With those parting words he started walking in her direction.\n Joseph chuckled to himself feeling downright giddy. Oh yes, his son was falling hard. He’d picked out the perfect match for him.\n “Amy, we have some work to do,\" Lucas said as he approached her and Mike. He didn’t even acknowledge Mike’s presence. Mike, not wanting to upset the boss, slunk away without another word. Amy lost a bit of respect for him. She turned around, inwardly sighing.\n “Yes sir, I’m sorry. I’ll get right on it,” Amy replied with her head held high while heading towards her office. She didn’t understand why he sounded so irritated. Everyone was at the party.\n It wasn’t like she was the one who’d thrown it.\n Lucas followed her into the office, then stood there looming over her as she sat down. “I don’t like office romances, they cause nothing but trouble,” he informed her in his most stately tone of voice, which caused the hair on the back of her neck to stand up. She had to silently count to ten before responding.\n “First of all, Mr. Anderson,\" she said through clenched teeth, “I was simply socializing with another employee. And second of all, who I do choose to have a romance with is none of your business.” Amy was surprised by the acid in her own voice Suddenly he was only inches from her face. “When you work for me you will listen to what I say. Mike’s a womanizer and I don’t want to deal with the repercussions when he throws you out like stale bread and believe me, he will.”\n Amy leaned back from him as her heart started beating hard. She was sure it was visible to him, even through her shirt. She forgot all about her anger with the man as the urge to reach out and grab him was so overwhelming. She wanted Lucas. Everything about him screamed sex and if he leaned in a couple of more inches and claimed her mouth she would welcome it.\n For what seemed like an eternity she couldn’t break contact with him. She felt liquid heat pooling inside of her. Look away, look away, look away, she shouted at herself until she finally found the will-power to turn her head, wondering how long they’d stood there face to face.\n Realizing how close he was to her and also the intense desire he had to kiss her shocked Lucas enough into standing up straight and retreating from her office. Before he could think about it he slammed the door, causing the pictures on the wall to shake.\n Lucas leaned against the door and willed his body to return to normal. He hadn’t felt so much desire for a woman since his college days. Even then he knew he’d possessed more control. If she hadn’t broken their eye contact he may have ended up taking her right there on her desk, just a few short feet away from hundreds of employees who could’ve walked in at any moment. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-billionaire-wins-the-game-billionaire-bachelors-1/page-2.html","bookId":2006,"book":{"id":2006,"title":"The Billionaire Wins the Game (Billionaire Bachelors #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Billionaire Wins the Game (Billionaire Bachelors #1) \n Joseph Anderson has decided it\u0027s time for his three successful sons to find brides.
