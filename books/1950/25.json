Of all their lives.\\n\\n 20\\n\\n Mary Jo woke to find Mack McAfee standing in the doorway of her private hospital room. “Mack,” she whispered. Her heart reacted to the sight of him, pounding extraordinarily hard. She hadn’t been certain she’d ever see him again.\\n\\n “How are you feeling?” he asked, walking into the room.\\n\\n “Fine.” Actually, she was sore and tired and eager to get home, to be with her family.\\n\\n “I brought you something.”\\n\\n “You did?” She sat up in bed and selfconsciously brushed her fingers through her hair.\\n\\n Mack produced a bouquet of roses, which he’d been hiding behind his back. “For you, Mary Jo.” He bowed ever so slightly.\\n\\n “My goodness, where’d you get these on Christmas Day?”\\n\\n He raised his eyebrows. “I have my ways.”\\n\\n “Mack.”\\n\\n “Oh, all right, I got them in the hospital gift shop.”\\n\\n “They’re open?”\\n\\n “Sort of…I saw someone I knew who had a key and she let me in.”\\n\\n Mary Jo brought the fragrant flowers to her nose and breathed in their fresh scent. The vase was lovely, too. “You shouldn’t have, but I’m thrilled you did.”\\n\\n “I wasn’t sure your brothers would remember to send flowers.”\\n\\n Her brothers. Just thinking about the three of them, all bumbling and excited, made her want to laugh. They’d practically shoved each other out of the way last night, fussing over her and the baby. They’d been full of tales about their misadventures in Cedar Cove and the people they’d met and their near-arrest. Mel had a few comments about a meat loaf sandwich, too—and then they’d all decided they were hungry again. Their gifts of the gold coin, the perfume and the incense were on the bedside table.\\n\\n When they’d arrived at the hospital, her brothers wouldn’t let her out of their sight—until the physician came into the room to examine her and then they couldn’t leave fast enough.\\n\\n They’d returned for a few minutes an hour later—apparently well-fed—to wish her a final good-night and promise to come back Christmas Day. Then they’d all trouped out again.\\n\\n “I stopped at the nursery to see…” Mack paused. “Do you have a name for her yet?”\\n\\n Mary Jo nodded. “Noelle Grace.”\\n\\n “Noelle for the season and Grace after Grace Harding?”\\n\\n Mary Jo smiled, nodding again.\\n\\n “I like it,” Mack told her. “The name’s just right. Elegant and appropriate.”\\n\\n His approval pleased her. She didn’t want to think too closely about how much his opinion meant to her—or why. She understood that they’d shared something very special, something intimate, while she was in labor. But that didn’t mean the bond they’d experienced would last, no matter how much she wanted it to. She had to accept that Mack had come into her life for a brief period. Soon she’d go back to Seattle with her family, and he’d go on living here, in Cedar Cove. It was unlikely that she’d see him again; there was no real reason to. The thought was a painful one.\\n\\n “Noelle Grace was a joy to behold,” Mack said with a grin.\\n\\n “Was she asleep?”\\n\\n “Nope, she was screaming her head off.”\\n\\n Mary Jo instantly felt guilty. “Oh, the staff should’ve woken me. It’s probably her feeding time.”\\n\\n Mack pulled up a chair and sat down beside the bed. “Nope, she just needed her diaper changed and to be held a little.”\\n\\n “Did someone hold her?” The nursery was crowded with newborns and there were only a couple of nurses on duty.\\n\\n “I did,” Mack admitted, somewhat embarrassed.\\n\\n “You?”\\n\\n “I hope you don’t mind.”\\n\\n “Of course I don’t! I—I’m just surprised they’d let you.”\\n\\n “Yes, well…” Mack looked away and cleared his throat. “I might’ve led the nurse to believe that Noelle and I are…related.”\\n\\n Mary Jo burst out laughing. “Mack, you didn’t!”\\n\\n “I did. And I have to say that as soon as I settled her in my arms, Noelle calmed down, stopped crying and looked straight up at me.”\\n\\n “You brought her into the world, after all.” She probably didn’t need to remind Mack of that; nevertheless, she wanted him to know she hadn’t forgotten what he’d done for her.\\n\\n The night before, she’d told her brothers that she would never have managed if not for Mack, and that was true. He’d been her salvation. She wanted to tell him all this, but the right words escaped her. Besides, she wasn’t sure she could say what was in her heart without getting teary-eyed and emotional.\\n\\n “I’m so glad you stopped by…I was going to write you and Brandon and thank you for everything.”\\n\\n “It’s our job.” Those had been Brandon’s words, too, and in his case, she assumed they were true. But Mack…Dismissing her appreciation like that—it hurt. Not wanting him to see how his offhand comment had upset her, she stared down at the sheet, twisting it nervously.\\n\\n Mack stood and reached for her hand, entwining their fingers.\\n\\n “Let me explain,” he said. “It is part of what we agreed to do when we accepted the job with the fire department.” He paused for a moment. “But the call from you wasn’t an ordinary one.”\\n\\n “How so?” she asked and looked up, meeting his eyes.\\n\\n “I’ve never delivered a baby before.”\\n\\n “I know. Me, neither,” she said and they smiled at each other.\\n\\n “It was one of the highlights of my life, being there with you and Noelle.”\\n\\n “Mine, too—I mean, you being there.”\\n\\n “Thank you.” His words were low and filled with intent. He leaned forward and braced his forehead against hers. “If it’s okay with you…”\\n\\n “What?” she prodded.\\n\\n “I’d like to see Noelle sometime.”\\n\\n “See her?”\\n\\n “See both of you.”\\n\\n “Both of us,” she repeated, afraid she was beginning to sound like an echo.\\n\\n “As long as it’s okay with you,” he said again.\\n\\n She nodded, trying not to act too excited. “If you want.”\\n\\n “I want to very much.”\\n\\n “I’ll be back in Seattle,” she said.\\n\\n “I don’t mind the drive.”\\n\\n “Or you could take the ferry.”\\n\\n “Yes.” Mack seemed just as eager to visit as she was to have him come by. “When?”\\n\\n She wanted him there as soon as possible. “The doctor said he’d release Noelle and me this afternoon. My brothers are picking us up at three.”\\n\\n “Is tomorrow too soon?” he asked.\\n\\n Mary Jo was convinced the happiness that flowed through her must have shone from her eyes. She didn’t think she could hide it if she tried. “That would be good,” she said shyly.\\n\\n “Merry Christmas, Mary Jo.”\\n\\n “Merry Christmas, Mack.”\\n\\n Just then the nurse showed up carrying Noelle. “It’s lunchtime,” she said cheerfully.\\n\\n Mary Jo held out her arms for her baby, born on Christmas Eve in Cedar Cove, the town that had taken her in. A town whose people had sheltered her and accepted her. The town that, one day, she’d love to call home.\\n\\n Home for her and Noelle. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-cedar-cove-christmas-cedar-cove-0/page-25.html","bookId":1950,"book":{"id":1950,"title":"A Cedar Cove Christmas (Cedar Cove #0)","description":"Storyline: A Cedar Cove Christmas (Cedar Cove #8.5) \\n Mother-to-be Mary Jo Wyse arrives in Cedar Cove on Christmas Eve, searching for her baby\u0027s father.
