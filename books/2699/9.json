Not held hostage with a knife to her neck, just Mom.\n She, on the other hand, freaked out. She stared at me for a moment, then down at her keys, at the number on the apartment door, and then back at me.\n \"Hunter...?\"\n \"Hi, Mom.\"\n The bag of groceries hit the floor, slumping to one side as its forgotten contents settled. She took a few steps forward, taking in my two-thousand-dollar black-tie splendor with her mouth wide open.\n \"Good God, Hunter, is that you? What happened?\"\n \"I decided to go for a new look.\"\n She blinked once in slow motion. \"No shit!\"\n Having induced mom profanity, I had to chuckle.\n She took a few more steps, shaking her head, and reached out to touch my platinum hair.\n \"Don\u0027t worry, Mom, it won\u0027t break.\"\n \"It looks pretty good. Actually, you look fabulous, but...\"\n My hand went to the bow tie. Had it already gone squiggly? \"But what?\"\n \"You hardly look like... you.\"\n Her voice cracked on the last word, and in one awful moment my mother managed to go all the way from profanity to tears. Her eyes glistened, her lips trembled, and she actually sniffed.\n I was appalled.\n \"Mom.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\" She rested one hand on my shoulder, the other covering her eyes. Her shoulders shook.\n \"What\u0027s wrong? What did I...?\"\n She looked up at me, and I realized she was laughing now, a deep sound that shook her whole body.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Hunter, you just look so damn different.\"\n I took a deep, relieved breath. We were back in profanity territory.\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m going to this party tonight,\" I explained. \"And it\u0027s kind of formal, so Jen and I were hanging out and we figured it would be fun to... you know, dress up.\"\n \"Jen did that to your hair?\"\n \"Uh, yeah.\"\n \"Well... well.\" She cleared her throat, just smiling now, though her eyes still glittered. \"You look incredible. When did you learn to tie a bow tie?\"\n \"Recently.\" I looked at the clock. \"Sorry, Mom, but I\u0027ve got to get to the party. It\u0027s way uptown.\"\n \"Of course.\" She nodded, the shock finally releasing its hold on her. Then she giggled. \"I\u0027m not going to tell your dad, though. Can\u0027t wait until tomorrow morning. Oh, hang on, I almost forgot.\" She reached into her bag. \"This really nice guy - \"\n \"Yeah, I know all about the nice guy.\"\n My phone emerged, and I reached for it. The familiar shape slid into my hand, solid and gloriously real. \"Thanks for getting it back for me. The nice guy, he didn\u0027t ask any weird questions or anything, did he?\"\n \"Uh, no. He just said he found it in Chinatown.\"\n \"Was he a bald guy?\"\n Her eyes narrowed. \"No. Why would he be?\"\n \"Or a silver-haired woman with a big alien face right here?\"\n \"Hunter, how exactly did you lose your phone?\"\n I shrugged, promising myself to explain everything later. \"Just dropped it, I guess. Thanks. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re okay.\"\n \"Of course I\u0027m okay.\" She smiled, stepping back to take me in again. \"I\u0027ve survived worse things than you dyeing your hair blond.\"\n I didn\u0027t tell her that wasn\u0027t what I\u0027d meant, just hugged her.\n \"Have a good time, Hunter,\" she said as we pulled apart. \"And tell Jen that I really, really want to meet her.\"\n I smiled. \"I will. I want you to meet her too.\"\n The weird thing was, I really did.\n The launch party was at the Museum of Natural History.\n The Natural is a sprawling Gothic castle settled against Central Park. The immediate neighborhood, full of park views and private grade schools that cost as much as Ivy League universities, is home turf for the hoi aristoi, which is Greek for \"aristocrats.\" Us regular folk, we\u0027re the hoi polloi.\n I took a cab uptown, a relatively small investment to lower the odds of damaging my two-thousand-dollar outfit. The long summer day hadn\u0027t completely given up its steamy grip on New York\u0027s asphalt; it was way too hot to be standing on a subway platform in black tie. And too weird. Mom thought I looked good, I thought I looked good, but cool is all about context. Among the rest of the hoi polloi, I would probably just look like a penguin.\n A hungry penguin. What with my brief, perplexing encounter with Mom, I still hadn\u0027t managed to get anything to eat. Hopefully the party would have a few platters of aristocratic food circulating.\n In the cab I pulled the two phones from my pocket, mine and Mandy\u0027s, comparing them to confirm that my own had actually come back to me. But what did that mean? Maybe the really nice guy who\u0027d returned it was exactly that, and no one was after me. Could Detective Johnson have been right about Mandy? Had she simply been called away to care for a sick relative and lost her phone somehow? Of course, for that to be true, the whole chase through the abandoned building would have to have been a misunderstanding. Or a random crazy guy? A hallucination?\n Didn\u0027t seem likely.\n And even these radical theories didn\u0027t explain the Hoi Aristoi launch party invitations. The anti-client was real and wanted to talk to me. Probably they had ditched my phone for some random passerby to find. They didn\u0027t need it anymore because they knew that I couldn\u0027t abandon Mandy to her fate (or resist the lure of the shoes) and that I would be at the party tonight.\n Fiddling with the phone\u0027s buttons, I decided to call Jen.\n \"You got Jen\u0027s phone. Leave a message.\"\n \"It\u0027s Hunter. I got my old phone back. Some guy, not a bald one, brought it to my mom at work. I don\u0027t know what that means. So, uh, see you later, I guess. That\u0027s the plan, right? Um, bye.\"\n I settled back into the taxi seat, wishing she\u0027d answered or at least that I\u0027d managed not to leave such a dorky message. I\u0027ve never been a fan of voice mail, which is basically a big magnifying glass for anything or anyone that makes you nervous. But surely I had no reason to be nervous around Jen. I thought about all the times she had caught my eye that day, had found reasons to touch me, to keep hanging out with me. Not to mention give me a complete makeover. Jen liked me.\n But did she like me? I rubbed my temples - the big problem with being dazzled by someone (yes, I was dazzled) is that you wind up too dazzled to see if they\u0027re dazzled by you in return. Or something like that. Maybe Jen was just fascinated by the hunt for the missing Mandy. Or maybe she thought I had adventures like this every day and was going to be disappointed when it turned out I didn\u0027t. And do girls usually bleach the hair of guys they want to hook up with? Probably not, but maybe Jen did\n Added to this mental remix was a certain awareness that my anxiety was probably focused in the wrong direction. If my disguise didn\u0027t work tonight, my crush on Jen was going to be the least of my worries: the anti-client might squash more than my ego.\n I thought about all those movies where the doubtful guy says, \"But we\u0027ll be walking straight into a trap!\" And the brave guy says, \"Yeah, but that\u0027s why they won\u0027t be expecting us.\" Which is, of course, complete crap. The whole point of setting a trap is that you expect someone to walk into it, right?\n But they were expecting dark-haired Hunter of the Skater Shorts, not blond non-Hunter the Mighty Penguin.\n I took a deep breath. I really needed some food.\n By this hour the museum was closed to the public, but its hillside of marble stairs was still dotted with tourists. I joined the other party-bound filtering up through the tired and sunburned clots of camera pointers. We swept gratefully into the museum\u0027s air-conditioned cool, women in evening gowns and men in black tie. In the lobby a barosaurus skeleton reared up over our heads, eighty feet high, defending its skeletal young from a skeletal T. rex. I remembered coming here as a kid, wondering why all these dinosaur skeletons were bothering to eat each other when there clearly wasn\u0027t much meat on any of them.\n The crowd was big enough to disappear into, the horde of voices smoothed to a rumble by marble echoes. Among my fellow penguins I felt very much in disguise, blending into the throng as velvet ropes channeled us from the lobby to the Hall of African Mammals.\n This was the old part of the museum, dating to the days when conservationists went to other places, shot animals, brought their corpses back, and stuffed them. Which is a kind of conservation, I suppose. In the center of the huge hall a family of stuffed elephants tramped along together, massive and clueless. Set into the walls around us were dioramas - zebras, gorillas, and impalas against painted African landscapes, staring out at us with wide glass eyes, looking paralyzed with surprise, as if no one had told them that tuxedos were required.\n The crowd was drifting in slow circles, moving clockwise around the elephants. True to Manhattan form, the party was just now kicking into gear two hours late, everyone grabbing their first drinks. The slow circling gave me the chance to scope things out, searching for a disguised Jen and any sign of the anti-client.\n I was jumpy. The little plastic twigs of the clothing\u0027s tags were starting to poke, and I was still surprised by glimpses of a certain peroxide stranger in the glass that separated me from the Africa veldt. Every girl of Jen\u0027s height dragged my eyes after her, but unless she\u0027d opted for plastic surgery, she wasn\u0027t any of them. Of course I flinched whenever a bald head popped up in the edges of my vision, half expecting a powerful hand to land on my shoulder and lead me away to some dark corner of the ^\n museum. I moved through the party, nervous and hyper-alert, as if the pair of sleeping lions in the corner diorama were still alive.\n To calm myself, I did what comes naturally to any cool hunter: I read the crowd.\n The demographic of Hoi Aristoi was young and wealthy, the sort of people whose job it is to go to this sort of party. You know who they are. Their names are in bold type in gossip pages, presumably to remind them what they did last week. They were here to refine their social skills, readying themselves for the day when their trust funds would blossom into real inheritances, and they would join the boards of museums and orchestras and opera companies and go to more parties. The odd camera flash snapped, gathering fodder for the Sunday Styles section and celeb magazines\u0027 back pages. Apparently Hoi Aristoi really had aristocratic roots. Any magazine that could occupy the entire Museum of Natural History for a party was backed by people with serious social connections.\n I wondered if any of the people here would ever actually read Hoi Aristoi. Would it run advice columns for the single scion? Essays on mink coat maintenance? Bargain buys for the bulimic\u0027s bathroom?\n Not that the articles really mattered. Magazines are just wrapping for ads, and advertisers must have been lining up to fill the pages of Hoi Aristoi, ready to flog Hamptons real estate, deals on drug treatment centers and liposuction, a dozen labels I shall not name. And for every true aristocratic reader would come a hundred wannabes, pitiful creatures willing to buy a handbag or wristwatch advertised, hoping the rest of the lifestyle would somehow follow.\n Why did this tribe annoy me so much? It\u0027s not like I\u0027m against social hierarchies - my job depends on them. Every cool constituency from hardtop basketballers to Detroit DJs organizes itself into aristocrats and hoi polloi, insiders and nonentities. But this crowd was different. Becoming an aristoi wasn\u0027t a matter of taste, innovation, or style, but of being born into one of a select hundred or so Manhattan families. Which is why aristocrats don\u0027t really have Innovators. For their new looks they rely on designers from Paris and Rome, hired help selected by Trendsetters like Hillary Hyphen. The top of the Hoi Aristoi cool pyramid - where the Innovators should be - is chopped off, sort of like the one on the back of the one-dollar bill. (Coincidence? Discuss.)\n Suddenly my step faltered, my sour mood lifting. A few yards away two rent-a-models were stationed in front of a trio of bedazzled bison. And they were giving out gift bags.\n Filthy rich or bomb-throwing anarchist, everyone loves gift bags.\n I grabbed one, assuring myself that it was just to look for clues about the party\u0027s sponsors. Parties in New York are always multi-corporate orgies, a mix of advertising, guest lists, and giveaways. Gift bags are the final repository of all this cross-marketing, with everyone involved throwing in an abundance of free toiletries, magazines, movie tickets, CD singles, chocolates, and minuscule bottles of liquor. The main sponsors (I don\u0027t mind naming brands, because you can\u0027t buy them in stores, for reasons that will soon become clear) were Hoi Aristoi magazine itself, a spiced rum called Noble Savage, and a new shampoo that went by the peculiar name of Poo-Sham. The big prize in the bag was a free digital camera, no bigger than an old-fashioned cigarette lighter, with the Poo-Sham logo plastered all over it.\n A free digital camera as a carrier for advertising. I gave this the Nod.\n Man cannot live on gift bags alone, though. I consumed the chocolate and looked around for real food.\n A tray went past carrying champagne and orange juice. I grabbed a glass of the juice and gulped, only to discover it was spiked with Noble Savage... a lot of Noble Savage. I managed not to sputter, drank it down for the sugar, and immediately regretted it. An empty-stomach buzz began to take hold of my brain.\n The party\u0027s edges softened around me, and I started to see imperfections in my fellow penguins\u0027 bow ties. All that individuality being expressed, according to Emily Post. Or had I gone with Vanderbilt? I couldn\u0027t remember, which seemed like a bad sign.\n Perhaps my anxiety didn\u0027t have to do with Mandy\u0027s disappearance, the potential dangers of the anti-client, the pretensions of the hoi aristoi, or even the mysteries of Jen\u0027s affections. It wasn\u0027t even low blood sugar. It was much simpler than that.\n I was alone at a parry.\n No one likes to feel left out. Like the small herd of stuffed impalas gazing sightlessly across the room toward me, I was a social animal. And here I was standing in a tuxedo, holding a gift bag and an empty glass of orange juice, feeling alone among a bunch of people I didn\u0027t know and instinctively didn\u0027t like.\n Where was Jen? I thought of calling her but didn\u0027t really have anything to report yet. It just looked like any other launch party so far.\n At this point I would have settled for a glimpse of the bald guy, even NASCAR Man or Future Woman. Hiding or fleeing would be better than standing around alone. Anything to give me a purpose.\n Another tray went by, carrying something that looked like food, and I followed it.\n The tray led me down a short hall toward the outer-space section of the museum. The planetarium rose up before me, a huge white globe on curved legs, as awe inspiring as an alien spaceship. Yet as so often happens in museums, I was thinking about food. I plowed after the tray, not catching the white-coated caterer until he was mobbed by a small and hungry crowd.\n The tray was covered with sushi experiments gone awry, tiny towers of fish eggs and multicolored tentacles, something that nonmetaphorical penguins might eat. Not exactly what I\u0027d been hunting for, but I grabbed a pair of what looked like plain rice balls and stuffed one into my mouth. Something inside it exploded into saltiness and fishiness, a sushi booby trap. I swallowed anyway, then inhaled the second.\n My mouth was so full that I couldn\u0027t scream when a certain bald-headed man stepped up next to me. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/so-yesterday/page-9.html","bookId":2699,"book":{"id":2699,"title":"So Yesterday","description":"Storyline: \n Ever wonder who was the first kid to keep a wallet on a big chunky chain, or wear way-too-big pants on purpose?
