{"id":72385,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Chapter 6 ANTOINE HAD TOLD ME THE HISTORY OF SHOES MANY TIMES: In the beginning, the late 1980s, the client was king. A certain basketball player (whose name basically became a brand) made them king. An industry was transformed, and shoes grew air pumps and Velcro straps, gel chambers and light-emitting diodes. New models came out seasonally, then monthly, and Antoine started buying two pairs, one for wearing and one for saving, like comic-book collectors with their plastic bags. And of course that bubble burst. People wanted shoes, not spaceships. Innovators began to search suburban malls for the humble sneakers of their childhood. Trendsetters demanded whole new categories of shoes: for skating, snowboarding, surfing, walking, running, and every other sport (parachutists probably have their own shoes), and to save all those secretaries time, hybrids appeared, dressy on top and rubber in the sole. The client - with its flashy, gimmicky, jump-shooting shoes - faded. The world it had dominated disappeared, broken down into a patchwork of tribes and cliques and niches, like some neighborhood controlled by a different gang on every block. But the pair in front of us recalled the oldies in Antoine\u0027s lovingly stacked boxes in the Bronx, those ancient, golden, simple days. Not spaceships - just shoes with insane confidence, vitality, and flair. Sheer cool. \"Wow,\" Jen said. \"I know.\" Acting on instinct, I pointed my phone and took a picture. \"Wow,\" she repeated. I reached out, and my hand glowed in the shaft of sunlight, as if the shoes were infecting me with their magic. The texture of the panels was something I\u0027d never felt before, as rough and pliable as canvas | but with the silvery shine of metal. The laces flowed through my fingers as softly as ropes made out of silk. The eyelets seemed to have tiny spokes that turned when I flexed the shoe, using the same effect as those 3-D postcards that change when you look at them from different directions. But the individual flourishes weren\u0027t what made the shoes incredible. It was the way they called to me to put them on, the way I was sure I could fly if I was wearing a pair. The way I needed to buy them now. A way I hadn\u0027t felt since I was ten. \"So this is what Mandy wanted us to see.\" \"No kidding,\" I said. \"The client must be keeping this a total secret.\" \"The client? Look again, Hunter.\" She was pointing at a circle of plastic set into the tongue, where the client\u0027s logo stood out bright white and proud. With my brain gradually recovering from its dazzlement, I saw what Jen had spotted right away. The logo - one of the world\u0027s best-known symbols, up there with the white flag of surrender and the golden arches - had been cut through with a diagonal line in bright red. Like a no-smoking sign. Like a no-whatever sign. The bar sinister, a symbol of prohibition also recognized around the world., ^ It was an anti-logo. \"Bootlegs,\" I murmured. That was another thing that went on in the I shadows of Chinatown. In rows of small, discreet shops on Canal Street you could buy watches and jeans, handbags and shirts, wallets and belts, all with the labels of famous designers sewn onto them by hand. All cheap and fake. Some were laughably crude, some pretty much passable, and a few required an eye as expert as Hillary Hyphen\u0027s to spot the telltale wrong stitch. But I\u0027d never seen any bootleg that was better than the original. \"Not exactly bootlegs, Hunter. I mean, it\u0027s saying right up front what it\u0027s not.\" \"True. I guess a bootlegger wouldn\u0027t do that.\" \"But who would do something like that? What\u0027s the point of a non-bootleg bootleg?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"They\u0027re so good. Like the perfect shoe the client never made.\" Jen shook her head. \"But Mandy called us here. Does she work for anyone besides the client?\" \"No. She\u0027s exclusive.\" I frowned. \"Maybe this really is their shoe. Maybe they have this master plan of rebranding as the opposite of themselves. Or maybe these are supposed to look like bootlegs when they\u0027re not. And after these get too popular, which they will, the client will absorb the backlash and become cool again. Maybe they\u0027re ironic bootlegs.\" Confused? Trust me, it was making my head hurt, and it\u0027s my job to think this way. \"That\u0027s so insane,\" Jen said. \"Or pure genius. Or something.\" \"Something really cool.\" \"So where\u0027s Mandy?\" \"Oh, yeah.\" Mandy was still missing. What did that mean? Jen and I sat there, sharing a moment of befuddlement, contemplation, and the thirsty pleasure of simply looking. Then I heard a noise somewhere in the darkness behind us. I tugged my eyes away from the shoe, looked up at Jen. She\u0027d heard it too. Glancing into the dark, I realized that my night vision had been wiped out by staring at the sunlit shoe. I was blinded but guessed that whoever was down there with us could see perfectly. \"Oh, shit,\" I said. With a soft rustle of paper Jen picked up the shoes and quickly laced them together. She draped them around her neck. I stood up and realized that one foot had gone to sleep. Not surprising. I could have happily died of starvation, staring at those shoes. Little lights danced at the corners of my vision, rods and cones trying frantically to get back online and help me see again. A shape moved in the blackness between us and the stairs, someone big and graceful. Absolutely silent. \"Hello?\" I said, my voice cracking in manly fashion. The figure stopped moving and faded back into the dark. For a moment I was convinced it had been a hallucination. Then Jen made her move. She kicked one of the pieces of chained plywood, opening the gap wide for a blinding second, the sunlight streaming in behind me. It revealed a big guy with a shaved head - intimidating but less terrifying than the phantom I had imagined - covering his eyes against the glare. \"Run!\" Jen shouted, and I bolted forward just in time for the tower of falling shoe boxes, her next brilliant move, to miss me. Mostly. They scattered into my path, and my own suddenly unspeakably lame shoes crunched into their virgin cardboard in a way that caused me pain. (Antoine had always taught me to prize the original box as highly as the shoe.) But I managed to get past the guy, arriving at the stairs just behind Jen. We ran upward, pounding the steps. Jen slowly pulled away from me, and I heard our pursuer coming up behind. I ran blindly, clawing at the dirty stairs with my hands to pull myself up faster, bouncing off the walls as the flights turned in a slow clockwise circle, my twisted ankle throbbing with every step. After four stories I was panting, and he was close enough that I could tell he wasn\u0027t breathing hard at all. Fingers grasped at my ankle on the last flight but slipped off, the grip not firm enough to bring me down. I burst out into the sun, blinked away the blinding light, and faced the six-foot climb between me and the next roof. Jen was already standing atop it, and I wondered if her rising-sun laces gave her special powers of running and jumping. \"Hunter, duck!\" she yelled. I did. The coolest shoes in the world passed over my head, tied into orbit around each other, spinning like a bola. I heard a grunt and a thump as they wrapped themselves around my pursuer\u0027s feet and brought him down, as heavy as a sack of doorknobs. If it hadn\u0027t happened so fast, I\u0027m sure I would have said, \"Don\u0027t save me. Save the shoes!\" But instead I scrambled up the wall and saw Jen already pulling on the cage door of the next building. \"It\u0027s locked!\" she cried, running farther down the block, disappearing as she jumped down to a lower roof. I followed in a limping run. Three buildings later we found an open roof door and made it down to the street and into a cab. Which is when I realized I had dropped my phone somewhere back in the darkness. Chapter 7 \"MY PHONE!\" The usual panic reaction: as if electrocuted, my body stiffened in the back of the cab, hands plunging farther into my pockets, down to the domain of lint and pennies. But the marvelous Finnish phone didn\u0027t magically reappear down there in the fluff. It was gone. \"You dropped it?\" \"Yeah.\" I remembered scrambling in the dark, using my hands to claw myself up the stairs. I\u0027d never put it back into my pocket. \"Damn. I was hoping you got a picture of that guy.\" I looked at Jen in disbelief. \"Not quite. I was more focused on the running away.\" \"Well, sure. The running away was a priority.\" She grinned. \"The running away was cool.\" My face may have indicated disagreement. \"Come on, Hunter. You don\u0027t mind a little running, do you?\" \"I don\u0027t mind running, Jen. I do mind running for my life. Next time we break into some place, let\u0027s just - \" \"What? Take a vote first?\" I took a deep breath, letting the sway of the taxi calm me. \"Let\u0027s just not.\" Then another groan. \"I had a picture of the shoes.\" \"Damn,\" she agreed. We were silent for a moment, thinking of that perfect balance of understated style, slow-burning desirability, and coffee-spitting, jaw-dropping eye candy that was the shoes. \"They can\u0027t be as good as we remember,\" I said. \"Nice try. They were.\" \"Crap.\" I checked my pockets again. Still empty. \"No phone, no shoes, no Mandy. This is a total disaster.\" \"Not quite, Hunter.\" Jen held up what looked like my phone, except it was the wrong color. Of course. It was Mandy\u0027s. She had the same model as I did (but with the red translucent clip-on cover). She was a fierce Early Adopter, and, like me, she used the phone for business. Just the day before, I\u0027d phoned her my picture of Jen\u0027s shoelaces. \"Well, that\u0027s something.\" Jen nodded. There\u0027s a lot you can find out from someone\u0027s phone. She began to poke her way through the menu, squinting at the glowing screen. The little beeps gave me a creepy feeling, like going through someone\u0027s pockets. \"Shouldn\u0027t we call the police or something?\" \"And tell them what?\" Jen said. \"That Mandy missed an appointment? Don\u0027t you watch cop shows? She\u0027s an adult. She can\u0027t be a missing person for twenty-four hours.\" \"But we found her phone. Isn\u0027t that suspicious?\" \"Maybe she dropped it.\" \"But what about the guy who chased us? What about the shoes?\" \"Yeah, we could tell the cops about that. About how we broke into an abandoned building and saw the world\u0027s most amazing shoes. And then a crazy bald guy appeared, and we ran away. That story should do wonders for our credibility.\" I was silent for a moment, out of arguments but still not comfortable. \"Jen, Mandy\u0027s my friend.\" She turned to me, thought for a moment, then nodded. \"You\u0027re right. We should try the cops. But if they do listen to us, they\u0027ll take Mandy\u0027s phone away.\" \"So?\" Jen turned back to the little screen. \"Maybe she took some pictures.\" We stopped the cab, paid for it, and found a coffee shop of the musty-living-room variety: old couches, high-speed Internet access, and strong coffee, which came in cups the size of bowls. Even before we walked through the door, I noticed Jen\u0027s bracelet sparkling. \"What\u0027s that?\" She smiled. \"It\u0027s a Wi-Fi detector. You know, so you don\u0027t have to boot up your computer to see if there\u0027s wireless in the house.\" I gave the Nod. I\u0027d seen them in magazines, useful for detecting which coffee shops and hotels offered wireless service, but wearing the gadget as jewelry was pure Innovator. We claimed a couch and huddled over Mandy\u0027s phone, our heads almost touching to align our eyes to the pixels of its little screen. Not really designed for two viewers, that phone, but I wasn\u0027t complaining. That close, I could smell Jen\u0027s hair stuff, a hint of vanilla cutting through the musty couch and ground coffee. Her shoulder was warm against mine. \"Something wrong?\" she asked. \"Uh, no.\" Memo to self: It\u0027s uncool to be overwhelmed by casual contact. I brought up the camera software, my fingers gliding over the cruelly familiar interface. (Maybe the Finlanders would send me another one.) The menu showed five pictures, displayed in the order they were taken. One thumb click later, a fuzzy orange face filled the screen. \"That\u0027s Mandy\u0027s cat, Muffin. He eats cockroaches.\" \"Useful beast.\" Next click a young Latina woman appeared, smiling and fending off the camera, breakfast in the lower third of the screen. \"Cassandra, her roommate. Or girlfriend - no one\u0027s sure.\" \"That would be girlfriend,\" Jen said. \"No one bothers to take a picture of their roommate.\" \"Maybe not, but when I first got my phone, I was taking pictures of my sock drawer.\" She gripped my arm. \"How will you live without it?\" \"I don\u0027t call it living.\" I clicked again. A guy wearing a black beret, maybe a little floppier than the last beret craze. A cool-hunting picture. \"Logo\u0027s too big, band\u0027s too tight,\" Jen said. \"And no berets in summer.\" \"And that shirt looks way Uptown,\" I said. \"Not the sort of thing you\u0027d see in Chinatown.\" I checked the picture\u0027s time stamp. \"She took it yesterday.\" The next picture brought a small gasp from Jen. It was a shoe, Jen\u0027s shoe, the rising-sun laces instantly recognizable. I could even see the hexagonal pattern of the East River Park promenade. \"Is that...? That\u0027s the picture you - \" \"Uh, yeah, I sent it to Mandy,\" I confessed. She pulled away, turned to me with narrowed eyes. I felt the musty-couch intimacy that had built up between us swirling away. \"You\u0027re not still confused about what I do for a living, are you?\" \"No. But it\u0027s just sinking in.\" She looked down at her laces. \"I\u0027m trying to figure out if I feel violated.\" \"Uh, try flattered, maybe?\" \"Hang on - what exactly was Mandy going to do with it?\" \"Take a look at it? Maybe pass it up the food chain.\" I cleared my throat, deciding to go for broke. \"Possibly use it in an ad or two. Put it into mass production. Make it available in every mall in America. Run your laces into the ground, basically.\" I saw questions crossing Jen\u0027s face, the familiar ones: Am I being ripped off? Is this a compliment? Am I secretly famous? When do I get my percentage? And of course: Is this guy an asshole or what? \"Wow,\" she said, after a long, awkward moment. \"I always wondered how that happened.\" \"How what happened?\" \"How cool stuff became uncool so fast. Like one day I see a couple of cholos wearing aprons on the street. Then ten minutes later they\u0027re in Kmart. But I guess I didn\u0027t realize what an industry it was. I figured at least some of it happened naturally.\" I sighed. \"It does, sometimes. But usually nature gets a helping hand.\" \"Right. Like sunsets with lots of pollution.\" \"Or genetically engineered bananas.\" She laughed, glancing at her laces again. \"Okay, I\u0027ll get over it. You sure know how to flatter a girl.\" I grinned happily - with that sudden and complete failure of irony detection that occurs when irony most needs to be detected - while questions rattled through my brain: Was she really flattered? Was I a fraud? Had I blown everything? What was \"everything,\" anyway? To cover my confusion, I clicked to the next picture. The shoe. My brain settled, focused by the beauty. We huddled again, pressed close for the best view on the little screen. The picture was minuscule, badly lit, agonizingly blurry, but the elegant lines and textures were somehow still there. We sat for a solid minute, sucking in the beauty, while around us trancy coffee shop music played, cappuccinos roared into being, and would-be writers wrote novels set in coffee shops. In the bliss our shoulders practically melted together, and I felt forgiven for stealing Jen\u0027s shoelace mojo. The bootleg-or-maybe-not shoe was just that good. Finally we pulled away from each other, blinking and breathless, as if we\u0027d shared a kiss instead of a cell-phone screen. \"When did she take that?\" Jen asked. I checked the time stamp. \"Yesterday. A couple of hours before the tasting.\" \"They look like they\u0027re on a desk.\" \"That\u0027s her office, I think.\" The shoe was sitting on a paper-strewn expanse not unlike Mandy\u0027s desk up in the client\u0027s Midtown tower. \"Which means... What does it mean?\" \"Search me. Last picture?\" She looked at the screen for another greedy moment before nodding. I clicked. It was a picture of nothing. Or something terrible. Dark and blurry, an abstract gash of light across one corner. Shades of grays all mottled together like a camo pattern. It was either an accidental photo from the bottom of Mandy\u0027s pocket, the visual equivalent of those random calls your phone makes when it gets bored, or it was a picture of Mandy being mugged, kidnapped, or worse. Maybe she\u0027d tried to record what had happened to her, then thrown the phone away, hoping someone would find it. But I couldn\u0027t make much out. \"Hang on.\" Jen pulled my hand closer, the phone almost to her eye. \"There\u0027s a face....\" She turned away, shaking her head. \"Maybe. You try.\" 1 took a closer look. Somewhere in the swirl of indifferent grays, there was something recognizable. A thing that my brain would, if I let it, twist slowly into a face. Which freaked me out and also gave me a headache. I checked the time stamp. \"This was taken about an hour ago.\" \"A little before eleven? That\u0027s about when I showed up.\" \"But you didn\u0027t see anything?\" Jen shook her head and stared at the tiny screen again. \"You can get these pictures onto a computer, right? Maybe there\u0027s some kind of software we can run to make this clearer.\" I nodded. \"I\u0027ve got a friend. She does special effects.\" \"What about the cops, Hunter?\" I took a deep breath. Lexa lived only two blocks away. It wouldn\u0027t take long. \"They can wait.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/so-yesterday/page-4.html","bookId":2699,"book":{"id":2699,"title":"So Yesterday","description":"Storyline: Ever wonder who was the first kid to keep a wallet on a big chunky chain, or wear way-too-big pants on purpose?
