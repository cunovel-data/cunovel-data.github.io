I always felt like she should have asked her guests to wear white jumpsuits and masks, but I guess that would\u0027ve been overkill. Lexa (short for Alexandra) didn\u0027t make her own microchips yet.\\n\\n What she did make was her own computers, which spent their lives with their guts exposed, in a state of constantly being tinkered with. In Lexa\u0027s apartment, dust was a Very Bad Thing.\\n\\n I\u0027d already buzzed from downstairs, but it wasn\u0027t until I gave the special our-shoes-are-off knock that the door opened.\\n\\n Lexa was dressed in immaculate khakis and a tight pink T-shirt, a handheld clipped to her belt. She had all the hallmarks of geek-girl beauty: a shy smile, chunky glasses, short hair framing elfin features, and the fashion sense of a Japanese teenager. Her look was as effortless and clean as those women that fashion designers draw with just a few sweeping lines.\\n\\n When I\u0027d first met Lexa, I\u0027d spent several months cultivating a massive crush on her until the terrible moment when she\u0027d mentioned that one of the things she liked about me was how much I reminded I her of herself - back when she was younger and not so boringly together. I never let on, of course, but ouch.\\n\\n \"Hi, Hunter.\" She hugged me, pulled back, still looking over my shoulder. \"Oh, hey...\"\\n\\n \"Jen,\" I supplied.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" nodding slowly, \"I liked what you said yesterday, Jen. Very cool.\"\\n\\n That brought a sheepish smile, one I liked more every time I saw it. \"Thanks.\"I\\n\\n We slipped into the apartment, and Lexa closed the door immediately behind us to fend off any dust swirling in our wake.\\n\\n I handed her the cup of coffee we\u0027d brought as an offering. She always said her brain was nothing but a machine for turning coffee into special effects.\\n\\n Jen took in the high-tech splendor, her eyes widening as they; adjusted to the darkness. Hardly any sunlight leaked in through the \\ heavy curtains (like dust, sunlight was a Bad Thing), but the apartment glowed around us. All of Lexa\u0027s furniture was made out of the stainless steel used in restaurant kitchens. The metal glittered with the scattered red and green eyes of gadgets recharging: a couple of cell phones, an MP3 player, three laptops, an electric toothbrush by the kitchen sink. (Despite all the coffee, Lexa\u0027s teeth were as clean as her apartment.) And of course there were several computers running screen savers, coiling blobs of light that reflected throughout the room. Jen\u0027s Wi-Fi bracelet o joined in the sparkling, excited by the heavy wireless traffic. Lexa noticed ^ the bracelet and gave it the Nod, and I felt obscurely pleased by this sign of approval.\\n\\n Steel shelves lined the walls, filled with memory chips and disk drives and cables, all of these spare parts coded with colored stickers. The top shelves were lined with about a dozen of those electric fireplaces with fake glowing embers, so that the ceiling pulsed with a rosy light.\\n\\n Sometimes there is a very fine line between being cool and being a crank. Whether you\u0027re one or the other depends on the overall effect. Lexa\u0027s apartment always filled me with a sense of calm, a room full of candles but without the fire hazard. It was like being inside a huge meditating head. Maybe it was a Zen thing after all.\\n\\n Making good money also helps with not being a crank. Lexa was famous for her special-effects work for a certain previously mentioned movie franchise, the one involving frozen kung fu and lots of ammunition. With plenty of income, Lexa cool-hunted as a hobby, as a calling, even. Her goal in life was to influence the manufacturers of MP3 players, cell phones, and handhelds to follow the principles of good design - clean lines, ergonomic buttons, and softly pulsing lights.\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t been over in a while, Hunter.\" She glanced at Jen, wondering if I\u0027d been busy.\\n\\n \"Yeah, you know. Summer.\"\\n\\n \"Did you get my e-mail about joining SHIFT?\"\\n\\n \"Uh, yeah.\"\\n\\n One more word about cranks: An Innovator friend of Lexa\u0027s had this theory that uppercase was coming back in. That all the Webby kids who\u0027d never hit the shift key in their lives (except to type an @ sign) were about to start putting capitals at the beginning of their sentences, maybe even the first letter of their names and other proper nouns. Lexa didn\u0027t really believe this seismic shift was imminent, but she desperately wanted it to be. Typographical laziness was slowly destroying our culture, according to Lexa and her pals. Inexactitude was death.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t clear on the details of the theory. But the concept behind SHIFT was that if enough Trendsetters started using capital letters in their e-mails and posts, maybe the herd would follow.\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t joined up, have you?\"\\n\\n I cleared my throat. \"I\u0027m sort of agnostic on the whole SHIFT agenda.\"\\n\\n \"Agnostic? You mean you aren\u0027t sure if capital letters exist?\" Lexa could be literal minded at times.\\n\\n \"No, I believe in them. I\u0027ve actually seen a few. But as far as the need for a movement goes - \"\\n\\n \"What are you guys talking about?\"\\n\\n Lexa turned to Jen, eyes alight with the prospect of a conversion. \"You know how no one uses capitals anymore? Just dribbles along in lowercase, like they don\u0027t know where the sentence starts?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I hate that.\"\\n\\n Lexa\u0027s well-brushed smile was blinding in the rosy gloom. \"Oh, you\u0027ve got to get into SHIFT, then. What\u0027s your e-mail?\"\\n\\n \"Um, Lexa, can I interrupt?\"\\n\\n She stopped, her handheld already unclipped from her belt, ready to take Jen\u0027s contact information.\\n\\n \"We came here about something important.\"\\n\\n \"Sure, Hunter.\" She reluctantly returned the tiny computer to her belt. \"What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"Mandy\u0027s disappeared.\"\\n\\n Lexa crossed her arms. \"Disappeared? Define.\"\\n\\n \"She was supposed to meet us in Chinatown this morning,\" I said. \"She didn\u0027t show.\"\\n\\n \"You tried calling her?\"\\n\\n \"We did, which is how we found this.\" I held up Mandy\u0027s phone.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hers,\" Jen said. \"It was in an abandoned building near where we were supposed to meet her.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a little creepy,\" Lexa admitted.\\n\\n \"More than a little,\" Jen said. \"There\u0027s a picture on the phone. It\u0027s blurry but kind of scary. Like maybe something happened to her.\"\\n\\n Lexa held out her hand. \"May I?\"\\n\\n \"We were hoping you would.\"\\n\\n Using Lexa\u0027s cinematographic hardware to look at a postage-stamp digital photo was like using the space shuttle to get to the end of the street. But the results were equally earthshaking.\\n\\n On Lexa\u0027s giant flat screen Mandy\u0027s last picture looked a hundred times more ominous. The gash of white that cut across one corner made sense now. It was the gap between the boards of the abandoned building, sunlight pouring through. The photo had evidently been taken from inside, only a few steps from where we\u0027d found the phone.\\n\\n \"It looks like it\u0027s been unlocked,\" Jen said, standing. Her fingers traced a dark snake in the bright patch, a chain swinging free between the boards, the blurred shape of an open padlock hanging at one end. The gap seemed wide enough for a person to squeeze through.\\n\\n \"So Mandy had a key,\" I said. \"She said she was going to show us something.\"\\n\\n Jen pointed. \"But when she opened it, somebody else was in there.\"\\n\\n I squinted at the blotchy shape in the darkest corner of the picture. Blown up this big, it seemed less like a face, the gradients of gray more jagged, like a mob informer with his identity concealed by computer.\\n\\n \"What do you think, Lexa? Is that a face?\"\\n\\n She was also squinting. \"Yeah, maybe.\"\\n\\n \"Can you do anything to clear it up?\" Jen asked.\\n\\n Lexa crossed her arras. \"Clear it up? Define.\"\\n\\n \"Well, make it look more like a face. Like on cop shows when the FBI guys do that computer stuff to pictures?\"\\n\\n Lexa sighed. \"Let me explain something, guys: Those scenes are rigged. You can\u0027t really make a blurry picture clearer; the information\u0027s already gone. Besides, when it comes to faces, your brains are better than any computer.\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t you give our brains a hand?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Look, I\u0027ve created ocean waves, crashing cars, whirling asteroids. I\u0027ve erased boils from movie stars\u0027 hands, made it snow and rain, even added smoke to an actress\u0027s breath after she refused to put a lit cigarette in her mouth. But you know what the hardest thing to animate is?\"\\n\\n Jen dared a guess. \"A human face?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s so mobile?\"\\n\\n Lexa shook her head. \"Humans aren\u0027t especially expressive. Monkeys\u0027 faces are more muscular, dogs have much bigger eyes, and cats have very emotive whiskers. Our crappy ears don\u0027t even move. What makes humans; so tough to do is the audience. We\u0027re human, and we spend our whole lives learning to read each other\u0027s faces. We can detect a glimmer of! anger on another person\u0027s face from a hundred yards through a fog bank. Our brains are machines for turning coffee into facial analysis. Take a drink and look for yourself.\\n\\n I swallowed the cold dregs from my paper cup and stared at the picture. It was a face, I decided, and it was starting to look familiar.\\n\\n \"Although frankly, this might help.\" Lexa stood but didn\u0027t reach for ^ the mouse. She went to the kitchen drawer and pulled out a long, thin box. With a swish and a tearing sound, she extracted a large sheet of wax paper, the kind you wrap sandwiches in. She held the translucent paper over the screen.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t ever tell anyone I said this, but sometimes blurry is better than clear.\"\\n\\n Jen and I gasped. Through the haze of the paper something recognizable had resolved.\\n\\n It was the face of the man who\u0027d come after us in the darkness. The bald head was obvious now, the heavy brow and childish lips all somehow cohering in the blur. And Lexa was right: we could read the expression perfectly, right through the wax paper and pixelization and darkness. The guy was eager, determined, totally in control.\\n\\n He was coming to get Mandy, like he\u0027d tried to get us.\\n\\n We sat there for a moment in silence, paralyzed, as if he\u0027d stepped through the screen into the room. Then a bouncy Swedish tune started to play.\\n\\n Take a chance on me....\\n\\n Mandy\u0027s phone had come to life, its lights blinking away. Lexa took a step, lifted it to look at its little screen.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s funny.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s calling?\" I asked.\\n\\n Lexa lifted an eyebrow.\\n\\n \"You are, Hunter.\"\\n\\n Chapter 9\\n\\n LEXA HANDED ME THE PHONE. THE SWEDISH TUNE KEPT PLAYING, insistent and diabolical.\\n\\n The readout glowed in the darkness. Incoming call: Hunter.\\n\\n \"It really is me,\" I said to Jen. \"It\u0027s my phone calling.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you should answer.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah.\" I swallowed and lifted the phone to my ear. \"Hello?\"\\n\\n \"Hi, uh, I\u0027m just calling because I found this phone. And I wanted to return it to the owner.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" My foolish heart lifted.\\n\\n \"Yeah, and this number was in the incoming call memory, so I figured the phone must belong to a friend of yours. Maybe you could give me the guy\u0027s name. Or his address?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, actually that\u0027s...\"\\n\\n My voice trailed off as I came to my senses: why did this person assume the phone\u0027s owner was a he?\\n\\n \"Uh, actually...\" I looked up at the face on the screen, at arm\u0027s length now. The voice on the phone was male and sounded like a big guy\\n\\n Maybe that guy.\\n\\n I cleared my throat. \"Actually, I don\u0027t recognize this number.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure? You just called it an hour ago. Like four times in a row.\"\\n\\n \"Uh, yeah, that was a wrong number,\" I said, trying to keep the tremor out of my voice. \"I have no idea whose number this is.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, okay. Well, sorry to bother you... Shoe Girl.\"\\n\\n The phone went dead.\\n\\n Shoe Girl, he\u0027d said. That was the name in my phone for Mandy: shugrrl, her instant-message handle. He knew I\u0027d been lying.\\n\\n \"It was him, wasn\u0027t it?\" Jen said.\\n\\n I nodded, looking at the grim face on the screen. \"He\u0027s calling the numbers in my memory, saying he wants to return a lost phone. He\u0027s trying to find someone who\u0027ll give him my address.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, crap,\" said Jen. \"But no one would do that, would they?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got about a hundred numbers in that phone. Eventually someone will give him what he wants. Probably my aunt Macy in Minnesota.\"\\n\\n \"You could call your aunt,\" Jen said, \"and all your close friends, the ones who know your address, and tell them what\u0027s going on.\"\\n\\n \"That might work if I could call them.\" I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t actually keep anyone\u0027s number in my head. Without that phone, I\u0027m toast.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t back up?\" asked Lexa, scandalized.\\n\\n \"Sure, at home.\" I tried to remember the last time I\u0027d actually backed up the phone onto my computer. A boring day during Christmas vacation? \"But by the time I get there and call everyone...\"\\n\\n \"Okay, guys, I was just trying to help with this and not be too nosy. But this is getting weird.\" Lexa pointed at the screen. \"How did that guy get your phone? And why does he care what your address is?\"\\n\\n \"Well, after Mandy didn\u0027t show up, he did. You see, we were in this old building, and there were these... shoes.\"\\n\\n \"Shoes.\" Lexa sighed. \"Why is it always shoes with you guys?\"\\n\\n \"They were amazing,\" Jen said softly.\\n\\n \"Amazing? Define.\"\\n\\n \"Can you keep a secret?\" I said.\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"I mean, really keep a secret.\"\\n\\n \"Hunter, I got the script for...\" (she named the third movie of a franchise in which a certain weight-lifting governor plays an unsmiling robot who shoots things)\"... a year before it came out. And I didn\u0027t leak a single plot point.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because there weren\u0027t any,\" I said. \"Just don\u0027t tell anyone about this, okay? Go one picture back.\"\\n\\n She clicked, and Mandy\u0027s picture of the shoe filled the screen, Lexa blinked, uncrossed her arms, and took a drink of her coffee. Stoking the machine.\\n\\n It was grainy, jagged, the colors blotchy, but it was still the shoe.\\n\\n \"Wow, the client did that? Didn\u0027t know they had it in them.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not sure,\" Jen said. \"It\u0027s either a bootleg or some radical new marketing concept. You can\u0027t tell from this picture, but the logo has a bar sinister through it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the anti-client,\" I said.\\n\\n Lexa smiled and gave a slow nod. The Nod. \"Cool.\"\\n\\n \"Cool enough to kidnap someone over?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Sure, Hunter.\" Lexa stepped back, squinting now, blurring the jagged picture with her eyelashes. \"Cool is money, and money can be worth anything. That\u0027s money\u0027s job.\"\\n\\n It was a way that only computer geeks talked, but it made sense. Jen gave Lexa the Nod.\\n\\n We sucked the memory out of Mandy\u0027s phone and made some calls.\\n\\n Her office phone went to a machine, and we left the obvious \"Where are you?\" message. Cassandra\u0027s cell phone did likewise, and I explained that Mandy had missed a meeting and could Cassandra please call Lexa. When Mandy\u0027s home machine answered, I just hung up, not wanting to leave multiple messages all smelling of fear. Until we had something more solid, I didn\u0027t see the point in worrying Cassandra about her missing roommate/girlfriend.\\n\\n Then we looked at Mandy\u0027s outgoing numbers. The last place Mandy had called was a car service, which was how she traveled since going full-time. The other outgoing calls led to the client\u0027s massive switchboards, nonspecific numbers that ended in three zeros - probably Mandy conferring with her bosses about \"Don\u0027t Walk.\" The only other call in memory was one to her home the night before. There were no clues that she had arranged to meet anyone else besides us this morning.\\n\\n But someone had told Mandy about the building and its mysterious contents. At least one of the client\u0027s countless execs knew more than we did.\\n\\n I looked at the phone. Having just had my cell phone ripped from my life, I knew how much information was trapped inside in the tiny plastic wafer of circuitry, but there was no easy way to get it out. Machines don\u0027t give up their secrets easily.\\n\\n Human beings, on the other hand, love to spill the beans. One by one, I went through the client\u0027s numbers that Mandy had stored, skipping straight past phone trees to human receptionists. Eventually one made the connection for me.\\n\\n \"Hello, I\u0027m making a call on behalf of Mandy Wilkins.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, do you want Mr. Harper?\"\\n\\n \"Uh, yes. Please.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll connect you.\"\\n\\n I waited for a moment on hold, listening to custom rap-Muzak exalting the latest big sports name who\u0027d signed on the client\u0027s dotted line. It sucked me in just far enough that my brain got a jolt when the exec came on.\\n\\n \"Greg Harper. Who is this?\"\\n\\n \"My name is Hunter Braque. I work with Mandy Wilkins. I was supposed to meet her this morning at Lispenard and Church... about the shoes.\"\\n\\n \"The shoes, yeah.\" His voice was slow, cautious. \"I think she told me about bringing you in. Outside consultant, right?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n \"Right, I remember now. Hunter.\" His voice changed, sharpened by recognition. \"You focused on \u0027Don\u0027t Walk, didn\u0027t you? Caused all that trouble?\"\\n\\n \"Uh, I guess that was me. Anyway, she didn\u0027t make the meeting - \"\\n\\n \"Maybe she had second thoughts.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, I\u0027m a bit worried. She didn\u0027t show for our meeting, but we found her phone. She\u0027s missing, sort of, and we were wondering what this was all about. The shoes, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t comment about the shoes. We do a lot of shoes. This is a shoe company. I don\u0027t even know what shoes you mean.\"\\n\\n \"Listen, Mr. Harper, I saw them - \"\\n\\n \"Saw what? You should have Mandy call me.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t know where she - \"\\n\\n \"Have Mandy call me.\"\\n\\n The line went dead. No Muzak, nothing. Somewhere during the call Jen and Lexa had stopped playing with the photo of the shoe to listen.\\n\\n When I dropped the phone from my ear, Jen said, \"What was that about?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d heard many forms of corporate desperation before, the frantic tones of lost market share, crumbling stock prices, multimillion-dollar contracts with college hoop stars who weren\u0027t cutting it in the pros, the horrifying realization of not knowing what those damn kids wanted anymore. But nothing quite as panicked as Greg Harper\u0027s last words.\\n\\n \"I think the client is in a state of denial,\" I said. \"But one thing\u0027s for certain: The shoes didn\u0027t come from them.\"\\n\\n \"So where did they come from?\" Lexa asked.\\n\\n I looked at Jen; she looked at me.\\n\\n We shrugged. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/so-yesterday/page-5.html","bookId":2699,"book":{"id":2699,"title":"So Yesterday","description":"Storyline: Ever wonder who was the first kid to keep a wallet on a big chunky chain, or wear way-too-big pants on purpose?
