The purple heads will be keeping their eyes on you. You\u0027re their only link to us. And that makes you useless for future operations.\"\\n\\n \"But we know the territory, like you said.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly, and the purple heads know you do. If you keep looking for us, you\u0027ll bring them straight to my doorstep.\"\\n\\n \"But - \"\\n\\n \"Just forget we exist, Jen James. Pretend this never happened.\" She smiled. \"If you\u0027re good, I\u0027ll put you on our mailing list.\"\\n\\n Mwadi stamped her skate once against the metal bed of the truck, a sovereign, final sound, and it jerked forward, rumbling in a slow circle around the blackened pile, then out of the courtyard and down the alley.\\n\\n Jen followed for a few steps, as if to plead her case again, but didn\u0027t say anything. She stood silent until the sound of the truck had faded to nothing.\\n\\n When it was gone, she turned and faced the pile.\\n\\n \"There must be something left.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Pieces, clues.\" She strode forward to the blackened edge, teeth gritted, her feet kicking ash into the air. \"Maybe we can find a sample of the canvas, or an eyelet, or one of those laces.\"\\n\\n I almost smiled. With everything in ashes, Jen had returned to her roots: shoelaces.\\n\\n She dropped to her knees in the smoking pyre, pushing her hands through the ruin, face averted from the heat still coming off the smoking plastic.\\n\\n \"Jen...\"\\n\\n \"We might even find a whole shoe in here. When houses burn down, they always find weird stuff the fire didn\u0027t - \" She lost the rest of her words, coughing from the smoke and ash she\u0027d raised. Her hands went to her face, leaving solid black streaks on her cheeks. She gained control of her breathing, then spat out something black.\\n\\n \"Jen, are you crazy?\"\\n\\n She looked up at me, clearly wondering why I wasn\u0027t down there with her.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"What does it look like I\u0027m doing? I\u0027m looking for the damn shoes, Hunter. That\u0027s what we\u0027ve been doing all along!\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I was looking for Mandy.\"\\n\\n She spread her blackened hands. \"Well, she turned out to be fine. She\u0027s probably up for a promotion. You want to give up now? Just because Mwadi Wickersham tells us to?\"\\n\\n I sighed and walked into the pile, feeling the warmth of the ashes through the soles of my shoes. The sun had gone down, and the remaining light in the courtyard came from the still-glowing core of the fire. I knelt next to Jen.\\n\\n \"Give what up?\"\\n\\n \"Looking.\"\\n\\n \"For what? The shoes are gone.\"\\n\\n She shook her head, as hard and angry as a twelve-year-old forced to move to New Jersey. Like the answer couldn\u0027t be expressed in words, and only an idiot would think it could. She was looking for lost cool, the hardest thing to find.\\n\\n I spoke softly. Jen, maybe it\u0027s better this way.\\n\\n \"Better?\"\\n\\n \"I mean, do you really want to work for those guys? Carrying out the grand plans of the Jammers? Spending every minute of your life thinking you\u0027ve got to change the world?\"\\n\\n She glared at me, eyes flashing. \"Yeah, that\u0027s exactly what I want.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve always wanted.\" She dug into the ash again, raising a black haze that settled over us, forcing me to turn away, eyes shut. \"I mean, what do you want to do, Hunter? Go back to watching advertisements for money? Hang out in focus groups and debate whether leg warmers are coming back? Poach the latest shoelaces? Just watch instead of making something happen?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t just watch.\"\\n\\n \"No, you take pictures and sell them, theorize and read a lot. But you don\u0027t do anything.\"\\n\\n My eyes opened wide.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t do anything?\" I sure felt like I\u0027d been doing things, at least for the last two days. Since I\u0027d met Jen.\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t. You watch. You analyze. You follow. That\u0027s the part of the pyramid you like the best: the outside, looking in. But you\u0027re afraid to change anything.\"\\n\\n I swallowed, the taste of smoke in my mouth like burned toast. No denials came to my lips because frankly, she was right. I\u0027d followed her every step of the way here. Whenever I would have given up, she\u0027d provided the next step. Just as cool hunters have always done, I\u0027d latched onto Jen\u0027s initiative, her dogged pursuit of the weird and terrifying.\\n\\n And in the end, I hadn\u0027t even managed the one thing I am good at: watching. I hadn\u0027t noticed us being followed and had let Jen be used by a bunch of stupid purple heads, leaving her with nothing but ashes.\\n\\n I remembered sending the picture of her laces to Mandy - selling Jen out the very first time I\u0027d met her. I was nothing but a fraud. As I\u0027d found out from the moment we\u0027d left Minnesota, there wasn\u0027t anything cool about me.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t belong with the Jammers or deserve to be with Jen.\\n\\n \"Okay. I\u0027ll get out of your way.\" I stood up.\\n\\n \"Hunter...\"\\n\\n \"No, I really want to get out of your way.\" I\u0027d never heard my voice so harsh or felt the lump in my stomach so hard.\\n\\n I walked away, and even before I reached the alley, I heard her back at work, picking through the pile.\\n\\n Chapter 34\\n\\n \"DID YOU WASH YOUR HANDS?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I washed my hands.\"\\n\\n My father looked up at me, for once finding my tone more disturbing than this morning\u0027s terrifying graph.\\n\\n \"Oh, sorry. Of course you did.\"\\n\\n Victory. If only I could have smiled. After so many years of trying, I had finally managed exactly the right robotic voice. Toneless, soulless, empty. I knew Dad would never ask me again if I\u0027d washed my hands.\\n\\n My anger at Jen, and at myself, had faded on the way home the night before, turning to something hard and cold by the time I\u0027d gone to bed. This morning I was a dead thing.\\n\\n Mom poured me coffee silently.\\n\\n A solid minute later my father asked, \"Long weekend?\"\\n\\n \"Very.\"\\n\\n \"Still love your hair like that,\" Mom said, her voice tipping up at the end, as though she were asking a question.\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"And those hands don\u0027t look as purple today.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t go that far.\" Under the harsh light of my bathroom mirror, I could see that the dye had faded only a tiny bit. At the current rate of decay, I might be graduating college with non-purple hands.\\n\\n \"Tell us what\u0027s wrong, Hunter?\" Mom asked.\\n\\n I sighed. They\u0027d probably already guessed, and I do tell them most things, sooner or later. Might as well get it over with.\\n\\n \"Jen.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m so sorry, Hunter.\"\\n\\n \"That was fast,\" Dad added, bringing his brilliant empirical mind to the matter.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I guess it was.\" I\u0027d met Jen Thursday afternoon. It was what? Sunday morning?\\n\\n Mom put her hand on mine. \"You want to talk about what happened?\"\\n\\n I shrugged, moved my face around, tried out different sentences in my head, and finally said, \"She saw through me.\"\\n\\n \"Saw through you?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Straight through.\" I could still feel the hole her gaze had left. \"Remember when we moved here? When I lost all my friends?\" My confidence, my cool.\\n\\n \"Of course. That was really hard on you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure it was hard on you guys too. But the thing is, I don\u0027t think I ever got over it. It\u0027s like I\u0027ve been a wimp since then. And Jen figured me out - I\u0027m too lame to hang with her.\"\\n\\n \"Lame?\" Dad asked.\\n\\n I found a better word: \"Afraid.\"\\n\\n \"Afraid? Don\u0027t be silly, Hunter.\" Mom shook her head at a forkful of eggs. \"This is probably something you two can work out.\"\\n\\n \"And if you can\u0027t,\" Dad chimed in, \"at least you haven\u0027t wasted much time on her.\"\\n\\n Mom did a minor coffee spit at this, but I managed to say the mature thing: \"Thank you both for trying to make me feel better. But please stop now.\"\\n\\n They stopped. And went back to saying and doing the usual, predictable things. Eating breakfast with the parents is always calming: they follow immutable patterns in that married-couple way, as if things have always been and will always be the same. They aren\u0027t Innovators. Not at the breakfast table. For one hour every morning they are Classicists of the best kind, my own Rock Steady Crew.\\n\\n But after I finished and went back into my room, there wasn\u0027t much to do but sit on the bed, wishing I still had my bangs to hide behind.\\n\\n The tiny teams of bottle jerseys were mocking me from their shelves, so I began a little project. I took the jerseys off the empty water bottles one by one, entering the vital statistics of each into eBay, then placing each jersey underneath its own book full of obscure and useless facts, flattening them for shipment.\\n\\n It was sad to break up the carefully assembled teams, but every general manager has to go into rebuilding mode every few years, sending away the familiar players and starting over with the low draft picks that losers are guaranteed. Plus if the auction gods were good to me, I might have the minimum payment for my next credit-card bill by the time it arrived.\\n\\n When my phone rang, I closed my eyes and took a breath. It\u0027s not her, I repeated silently a few times, then forced myself to look at the caller ID.\\n\\n shugrrl. Mandy.\\n\\n I should have been glad that she was calling, that she had escaped the purple heads and was already talking to me again. But the name made my heart sink a little further. If it was going to be like this every time the phone rang and it wasn\u0027t Jen, my life was going to suck.\\n\\n \"Hi, Mandy.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Hunter. Just wanted to catch up with you.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"First, let me say sorry for missing our meeting Friday.\"\\n\\n I laughed, which hurt because of the cobblestone in my stomach. So those were the rules: no mentioning the Jammers or the shoes. Mandy\u0027s lost weekend would be our little unspoken secret.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s okay, Mandy. I know it wasn\u0027t your fault. I\u0027m just glad you\u0027re okay.\"\\n\\n \"Never better. Actually, I\u0027m up for a promotion.\"\\n\\n I nodded, feeling a little twinge of pain that Jen had called that one.\\n\\n \"But thanks for your concern. Greg told me you called. So did Cassandra. In fact, everyone told me about how worried you were. I may have seemed annoyed the last time I saw you, but I won\u0027t forget that you came looking for me.\"\\n\\n \"No problem, Mandy. Looking for you led to some... interesting adventures.\" The cobblestone rumbled at the words.\\n\\n \"So I hear. That\u0027s the other thing I wanted to call you about.\" She paused.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"Well, there are issues around this weekend, things we need to let chill for a while. The client doesn\u0027t want to get connected with events at a certain launch party. Certain influential persons are annoyed, and we have constituency relations to consider.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" My mind translated slowly, however straightforward the text: The client didn\u0027t want the purple-headed powers-that-be to know about their deal with the Jammers. Those powers were very pissed off and would be for a while. \"What does that mean, Mandy?\"\\n\\n \"It means that I can\u0027t give you any work. Not for a while, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Ah.\"\\n\\n I saw it all clearly now: I was the fall guy. The only person that the hoi aristoi could get their purple hands on, the only thread that might lead to the Jammers. The client would be keeping its distance.\\n\\n Everyone would.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m really sorry about this, Hunter. I always liked working with you.\"\\n\\n \"Me too, with you. Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\\n\\n \"And you know, these things don\u0027t last forever.\"\\n\\n \"I know, Mandy. Nothing does.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the spirit.\"\\n\\n Five minutes later I was searching my shelves for more things to sell, and the phone rang again. Again I averted my eyes from the caller ID.\\n\\n It\u0027s not her, it\u0027s not her.... Maybe ten times would do the trick.\\n\\n It was her.\\n\\n \"Uh,\" I said. (Which is like \u0026laquo;yeah\u0026raquo; but much, much less hopeful.)\\n\\n \"Meet me at the park. Where we first met. Thirty minutes okay?\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/so-yesterday/page-21.html","bookId":2699,"book":{"id":2699,"title":"So Yesterday","description":"Storyline: Ever wonder who was the first kid to keep a wallet on a big chunky chain, or wear way-too-big pants on purpose?
