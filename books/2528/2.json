{"id":109571,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Chapter Two\n Yonnie stood on the roof of Club Vengeance and breathed in the night air. For he\u0027d gambled right, had chosen to ally with Carlos Rivera, and had been handsomely rewarded. He\u0027d been given management of the club with nearly free rein. Rivera was cool like that, it seemed.\n A blue haze filtered across the moon and he smiled. It was in the air, a surge of power that all vampires had to acknowledge. The blood in the territories had more adrenaline kick to it, the kills were more satisfying... existence was good. To be a third-level vamp and take a club from a second-level just by strategically aligning with the right man, was unprecedented. All of a sudden he cocked his head to the side, briefly shut his eyes, and felt the powerful surge of sex in the air. Damn! Even the sex in the territory was sweeter under Rivera\u0027s rule. He just wished he knew who the vamp female was that Rivera had just turned. It was a fresh turn. Her vibe set his teeth on edge. But she felt stronger than a second...\n \"Damn, sis,\" Yonnie muttered as he strolled to the edge of the roof and peered down at the small specks of humanity beneath him.\n \"Enough to give a brother wood.\" All he could do was shake his head as he wondered what it would be like to become a second-gen vampire, or even a master.\n Yonnie chuckled to himself. Maybe if Carlos remained in a particularly generous mood he might share his new lair kitten. Yonnie quickly banished the thought. Not a strong female like that - she was destined for a throat mate-marking, for sure. No sense in a man getting his heart ripped out by the boss over wishful thinking. But to be able to transform into pure vapor and fuse with the blue haze of the moon... To be able to attract all the females that the master had no further use for, have them trembling for one vein hit.\n Yonnie shook his head as he balanced on the drain gutter, tempting his good fate. Rivera had been cool enough to give him Club Vengeance and let him run the other clubs in the network; pushing his luck farther to ask for more would not be wise.\n He turned his head and looked at the metal door leading to the club. He could sense the approach of a guard. He smiled. That was odd. As a third-level, he had some precognitive skills, but he had never been able to sense another third-gen like this.\n \"Yo, man, what\u0027s up?\" Yonnie said, thoroughly amused by his new strength.\n \"We just got back from Philly,\" the guard said, shaking his head and raking his fingers through his ragged Afro.\n Yonnie allowed his gaze to roam over the thickly built vamp. His boy\u0027s army fatigue vest was in shreds, his jeans were dusty, his Timberlands were crusted with mud and old blood. None of which was a good sign. Old human blood, yes. Black blood from the empire, no. Stack\u0027s normally deep brown color was dull, which meant he\u0027d been in battle and hadn\u0027t stopped to refuel. Stack had been in a hurry. What had gone down in Philly? His euphoria quickly faded. If Rivera came back and found out that he and his boys couldn\u0027t hold it down... He didn\u0027t want to think about it.\n \"What the fuck happened, Stack?\" Yonnie said, walking up to his friend. He smoothed the front of his electric-blue suede jacket and hitched up his black leather pants. \"Man, we just got this promotion. You know the boss\u0027s rep,\" Yonnie warned, speaking low and firm. \"You fuck this up and there\u0027s no tellin\u0027 - \"\n Stack stepped away from Yonnie. \"It ain\u0027t like that. You shoulda been there. We was checkin\u0027 on the Philly clubs, like you said. We was up in North Philly - where they have all them damned row houses stuck together so you can run a whole block roof to roof, if you get in trouble. But you have to be careful, because the humans got storefront churches in them houses, so some of the roofs are hot, and - \"\n \"Aw\u0027ight, aw\u0027ight, I get the picture. So, you was up in the badlands. The humans got outposts, so who hit us?\"\n Stack stared at Yonnie for a moment and then looked away. \"Humans.\"\n \"What?\" Yonnie was incredulous. \"The Guardian team is in LA, man. How you gonna tell me that - \"\n \"No, man,\" Stack said, grabbing Yonnie by both arms. \"Can\u0027t you feel it in the air? We were in one of our clubs, everything was going smooth, the girls were dancing the poles. We were about to do a little dinner theater - chick about fifteen or sixteen. You know, blood sacrifice for the crowds, when the fucking door blew in and these big, burly, black motherfuckers came in and lit the joint up. Rowdy black giants, and shit, are what they call themselves.\"\n Yonnie opened his mouth and closed it. Stack dropped his arms and walked away.\n \"Lost three of our boys. They have one about the size of Damali\u0027s big man, Mike. And a smaller version of Shabazz. Like ten or eleven of \u0027em, and they roll fast, combat-style, then be gone. We got our asses kicked, man. They drew us to the rooftops. We thought we could escape, but that\u0027s their backyard. Lost one of our boys on a disguised roof - was hallowed ground and he torched on impact. Then that big Hannibal-looking guy threw a hammer at our other boy, and the way it hit him, it dazed him, and he fell wrong off the roof - two of them got him on the ground before he could get up. Third one got wrapped up in motorcycle chains - pure silver dipped in holy water - strangled to death. We was out.\"\n \"You sure they were human?\"\n \"Man, they bled red blood, okay?\"\n Stack let his breath out hard and leaned against the metal door and shut his eyes.\n For a moment, Yonnie didn\u0027t move. He became so still that he didn\u0027t even breathe, sensing the atmosphere.\n \"You feel like you\u0027re getting stronger?\" Yonnie whispered to his friend.\n \"That\u0027s the crazy thing about it,\" Stack said quietly, peering around nervously. \"We felt strong as shit going in. Every one of us was on top of our game. We were drinking toasts to you for getting us aligned with Rivera, and they were saying that even back in the day under the old regime, we\u0027d never had the blood flowing like this. At one point tonight, it was like the females were all in heat. You could feel it in the air.\"\n \"Yeah, I know, man,\" Yonnie muttered as he began to pace. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s so freaky about humans taking you out like that.\"\n Both vampires looked at each other for a long time but said nothing.\n \"If we\u0027re getting stronger, it has to be because he\u0027s getting stronger.\" It was more a question than a statement.\n \"Then, it makes sense,\" Stack said, but his voice seemed unsure. \"If our side just kicked up a notch, then the light maybe kicked up a notch?\"\n \"That has to be it.\" Yonnie continued to walk back and forth, running his palm over his jaw. \"See, you guys probably ran into a regulation Guardian team - there\u0027s like a hundred forty-four thousand of them bastards in hidden cells scattered throughout the globe. So, what happened in Philly was good. We\u0027ll explain to Rivera that you tracked down a splinter Guardian unit in his territory. Cool?\"\n \"Right. Makes sense. We tell him that we were holding down his club, and we drew fire. Then, we can ask him if he wants us to take a small army back there to deal with the Philadelphia problem.\"\n Yonnie was walking in circles now, perspiration making his black silk shirt cling to his body. \"Yeah, man. That could work.\"\n Stack wheezed as he pushed himself away from the metal door.\n \"You need to eat,\" Yonnie said with concern. He slung his arm over Stack\u0027s broad shoulders.\n \"Let it go, man,\" Yonnie told him. \"We\u0027ve gotta take this shit like men. We\u0027ll feed, get laid, and be merry since tonight might be our last night once Rivera blows in here.\"\n Berkfield walked the perimeter of his suburban home one last time before he set his top-of-the-line security system. His wife thought his job was making him paranoid; it was better that she and his teenage son and daughter believed that. They didn\u0027t need to know that his floodlights were special UV halogens, nor did they need to know that the lawn and garden sprinkler systems contained holy water.\n If his family knew he believed in monsters, they\u0027d have him committed. Then what would happen to them? Who would take the special precautions that had become a neurotic routine?\n He scanned the short hedges and peered into his neighbor\u0027s yard. All seemed well. It was still light out, nearly dusk, and people were about, messing with yard equipment, calling children in for dinner, and washing their SUVs and minivans after work.\n Maybe he was crazy, but he\u0027d witnessed his partner\u0027s shot mysteriously turn on him when he\u0027d tried to shoot a guy with fangs. Carlos Rivera had dropped a gold mine of info on the local drug lords in his lap. Then Rivera had disappeared and he\u0027d come up empty on all his searching into Rivera\u0027s territories. There was something very serious going on... Then again, maybe he was just crazy.\n Berkfield\u0027s shoulders sagged resignation as he slowly walked toward the garage.\n A bee sting on his calf made him wince. He hated yard work and he hated bugs. He grunted with exertion as he leaned on the workbench to pick up the garage-door opener that had fallenï¿½and froze when he saw a shiny pair of military-issue black shoes on the other side of his minivan. Then everything went dark.\n Groggy, Berkfield woke with a start, his gaze darting around. He was in a van. A gaunt, older, Caucasian male with dark sunglasses and a shock of unruly white hair leaned in close and shined a pen-light in his eyes, causing him to squint.\n \"You\u0027ll be a little disoriented for a moment,\" the man with the light said, \"but it will wear off. Our apologies for the way we had to collect you.\"\n \"Who are you?\" he said, his voice tense and angry. \"What do you want? Where\u0027s my family?\" He let his mouth snap shut. What if his captors didn\u0027t know that he had a beautiful wife, daughter, and son? Damn it! Whatever they\u0027d given him had made him sloppy.\n \"That\u0027s why we have taken you,\" the strange man said.\n Berkfield studied his abductor intently. He had a wild rush of silver hair all over his head, piercing gray eyes, and a seeking expression. He looked like someone\u0027s professor. His accent was foreign, but hard to place. His demeanor was calm, almost too calm.\n \"What do you want?\" Berkfield noted the four heavily armed men on either side of the professor.\n \"We\u0027re trying to protect you,\" the man said.\n \"Protect me?\" Berkfield\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"What branch of government are you from?\"\n The man offered a patient smile. \"What\u0027s about to happen is an international issue. Not just an American issue. But you, my friend, are at risk.\"\n Berkfield ran his sweaty palm over his bald scalp. His objective was singular - get home to ensure that these nuts hadn\u0027t harmed his family. \"I\u0027m just a cop on a local force - not worth much to anybody,\" he hedged.\n The man\u0027s face became stern and the polite smile vanished from his face. \"Let\u0027s stop playing games, Detective Berkfield - or is it Captain now? You are lucky to have so narrowly escaped death at the hands of your partner. And even more lucky to be placed under the protective seal of the master vampire in this territory, Carlos Rivera.\"\n Stunned, Berkfield leaned forward. \"You\u0027ve seen him? What do you know?\" His voice escalated. Someone else, somebody in authority, knew there was such a thing as vampires! Berkfield grabbed his captor\u0027s arms. The henchmen bristled, but the man before him remained calm. He nodded reassuringly.\n Gently extricating himself from Berkfield\u0027s hold, the man sat back and removed his sunglasses. \"They are the most fascinating creatures we have yet to study,\" he said. \"They have abilities that we could never fathom. Until we found out about your situation, we thought that they didn\u0027t have anything resembling a conscienceï¿½that their capacity to discern emotions, like empathy, was impossible. But they can, which means there may be hope.\"\n Total confusion kept Berkfield riveted, but there were so many questions that he needed to ask that he couldn\u0027t contain himself.\n \"You actually know there are such things as vampires? You guys study them? You\u0027ve seen the vampires? You know about Carlos? When did he become one? How? We\u0027d just seen him taking a stroll by day, then, bam, just like that, he\u0027s a creature of the nightï¿½And the girl. Is she one? I\u0027m not bitten, am I? You guys work for the feds, black ops? CIA? You said my family is at risk. Why? Some-fucking-body talk to me!\"\n \"Take a deep breath, Mr. Berkfield,\" the man ordered. \"Yes, to all of the above, except we don\u0027t work for the feds. Every government has been searching for its next weapon of mass destruction. They\u0027ve each set up very small, well-funded, independent science teams to research these areas. But a few years ago, several of us broke away from our countries and banded together under an international umbrella. Once the governments saw that they\u0027d lose their top scientists and that their threats had minimal effect on men who\u0027d lived their entire lives on a quest of knowledge, they begrudgingly funded our group. Currently, we\u0027re made up of all the global superpowers. Recently we began to follow up on some old German research.\"\n The man\u0027s eyes contained pain, and his voice became weary. \"Our directive, when attached to our respective countries, was simple. Find a way to harness the paranormal, if it existed, and give it to the highest bidder within our respective military units. Phase one was to determine if there was such a thing as a paranormal plane. We succeeded with those tests. But as we gained further insights, it became apparent that the dark energy was limitless and stratified - almost like finding out there\u0027s an entire universe within a universe... space exploration is nothing compared to what we\u0027ve uncovered. Yet, it\u0027s all linked; the esoteric sciences are just as real as hard quantum physics.\"\n He gazed at Berkfield, his beady, gray eyes shining. \"We also found out that there was another side - a side we hadn\u0027t considered. If there\u0027s a Hell, there\u0027s a Heaven,\" he whispered. \"You cannot even begin to quantify the energy of that realm. Since we couldn\u0027t capture it, they wanted us to abandon that as a potential source for weaponry and to focus on dark matter. That\u0027s when the group fractured... Several good scientists died or, better stated, were murdered or driven mad. Those of us who survived now pretend to go along with the demands of our governments.\"\n Berkfield sat very still. \"So, you guys are like a hostage ghost-busters team?\" he said as he continued to look for a possible escape route.\n The man sighed. \"Don\u0027t be foolish. We found hard evidence behind every myth and legend. We\u0027ve catalogued demon fila, Detective Berkfield. The ancient high priests, warlocks, witches, generals, you name it, called on deities to assist them in wartimes. The new era of so-called reason has made us forget their power.\"\n \"So, you plan to do what with me and my family?\"\n Raking his fingers through his hair, the man looked Berkfield in the eye. \"Listen carefully. We don\u0027t have much time. There are two sides of this organization - those insane enough to believe that they can open up the gates of Hell and contain what comes out of it, so that they can proceed with imperialistic desires to rule humanity. And those of us who, after having studied the phenomena, have enough respect for it to leave it alone. We know that chaos will ensue. Therefore, the group is philosophically at odds with itself and threatening to implode. That means that valuable and dangerous research will spill out into the various nations that support this work, and as we all know, anything is for sale on the black market. Do you follow?\"\n Berkfield nodded, but he still didn\u0027t understand his role. This whole story was too bizarre to wrap his mind around.\n \"You, my friend, are currently under the protective seal of the master vampire who controls this region; therefore, right now, you\u0027re in full favor. The dark side essentially has a no-hit policy on you, and the Light apparently has you covered, as well. However, the way the power shifts seem to work within the vampire world are very much like old feudal law - they wipe out anything once associated with the outgoing incumbent. Understood?\"\n Terror halted Berkfield\u0027s breath for a moment. He touched his throat and then his fingers slid down to the small gold cross that he never took off. \"But I\u0027m a believer,\" he rasped. \"How could I be marked by the dark side?\"\n The scientist calmly reached beneath his olive green flack-jacket and pulled a long chain from beneath it, bearing a sterling silver Star of David. \"I\u0027m a believer, too. The mark isn\u0027t physically on your body. It\u0027s in your aura. That\u0027s what we measure - energy fields, if you will. Our equipment cannot pick up much more than that. All we can ascertain is that a very strong energy from the nether realms has been gathering in the region, and it has been sending out sensor tentacles in your direction. Time is nigh, my friend. We\u0027re not exactly sure what this means, but it cannot be good.\"\n \"My wife, my kids - how do I get this fucking seal off me? I didn\u0027t ask for it, I don\u0027t even understand it!\"\n \"That\u0027s why we want you to make a decision - quickly - to come work for us. Maybe, just maybe, you hold the key to bringing both sides to a standstill, a stalemate. You were deemed a good man by both sides. You could be the key to creating world peace. We must have an opportunity to study you, understand the conditions that led up to - \"\n \"No! I don\u0027t know! This is all so crazy!\" Berkfield put his head in his hands. \"I want my old life back, my kids and wife safe. I want to read the damned paper, drink beer, and worry about gas prices. I do not want to be a guinea pig, nor do I want my family traumatized.\"\n \"Then you should have never become a crime fighter, never should have made that bargain in that alley, never should have started researching otherworldly phenomena and come up on our radar. I am a man of logic. I\u0027m a scientist with thirty years of hard research under my belt and degrees that would...\" The man stopped, swallowed hard, his voice gravelly with emotion. He spread his hands before Berkfield, imploring him to understand.\n \"I\u0027m no cop. I\u0027m no weapons designer. I opened a gate in a lab and found Hell,\" he said in a barely audible tone. \"I thought I was losing my mind, and I cried out to God to save me, and another door opened and bright light bearing a blade shut the gate. We all saw it - and all of those colleagues joined us that day.\" The man\u0027s gaze slid away and he held the hair at his temples in clenched fists as he stared at the locked back door. \"Some said it was a group hallucination. We told our superiors and they gave us an unlimited budget. That\u0027s when I knew we were in trouble.\" His voice dipped to a scratchy murmur. \"They don\u0027t open the financial floodgates unless they know you\u0027re close. We\u0027re so close, and so are they.\"\n \"I thought I was the only one...\" Berkfield said, dazed.\n \"So did we,\" the professor said sadly. \"Then we began religious research, started looking at texts we had never considered in our scientific quest.\" He glanced up at Berkfield. \"Ever wonder why you were spared that night in the alley where your partner double-crossed you and pulled a gun on you? Ever wonder what higher purpose you are to serve?\"\n The two men stared at each other, only the faint sounds of traffic droning on in the background.\n \"But my family - \"\n \"Will be relocated and re-identified, just like ours had to be.\"\n \"But we can\u0027t just leave our home - \"\n \"You make your informants do it all the time. Think of it as a witness protection program for scientists, and like I said, we\u0027re well funded.\"\n \"I can\u0027t make a decision like this without talking to my wife and my kids, and - \"\n \"All you have to tell them is that one of the drug lords you\u0027ve put away is out now and looking for payback. They know what you do, so that\u0027s not too far-fetched.\"\n Berkfield sat back. \"Why me? What special skill do I bring to the table?\"\n His abductor leaned forward and touched his clasped hands. \"You\u0027re sane, you\u0027re not on the take, you\u0027ve been spared because you\u0027re a good man, and you can call this master vampire to you. We need to speak to him. Plus, you know the inside of the American legal system like the back of your hand, and you have connections. And we may need sanctuary.\"\n \"But why now?\" Berkfield asked, not convinced that this was his problem or that he needed to get swept up into the madness of trying to solve it. Truthfully, it was enough that he\u0027d learned that vampires and demons were real. He didn\u0027t need to know more, or want to know more - except how to keep them away from him and his family.\n \"We\u0027ve forecast a problem that is about to blow up on American soil. The dark-side energy levels are off the meters. We have a small sample of its atmosphere contained, and it\u0027s expanding exponentially within the vacuum containers in the lab. More current is being drawn into it, and its density is increasing. Disturbance locations in the U.S., where we know there are dark energy fields, are almost, for lack of a better explanation, harvesting power.\"\n The van came to a sudden stop. Berkfield and the scientist\u0027s gaze locked.\n \"You have twenty-four hours to make your decision. Push nine-one-one on your garage-door opener between now and then, and we\u0027ll come collect you. They won\u0027t expect the code to be imbedded there. Ignore our offer, and you\u0027re on your own.\"\n A henchman motioned for Berkfield to open the door. \"You\u0027re home. You never saw us. We do not exist.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bitten-vampire-huntress-legend-4/page-2.html","bookId":2528,"book":{"id":2528,"title":"The Bitten (Vampire Huntress Legend #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bitten (Vampire Huntress Legend #4) \n The vampire civil war has been averted, deadly were-demons have been beaten back and now it Damali Richards and Carlos Rivera (now a Council level vampire) will finally have the chance to settle in and explore their deeper, sexier love.
