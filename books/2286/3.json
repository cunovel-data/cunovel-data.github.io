Someone asked him about Fantasy Fest and Marty explained that it was kind of like Mardi Gras-a king and queen were elected-and kind of like Halloween, and kind of like the biggest, wildest party anyone could think of. Costumes, parties and special events all around the city. There was a parade with dressed up pets-and undressed people in body paint. It was fabulous, a feast and pure fantasy for the heart and the imagination.\\n\\n He was proud of himself for his explanation. The next person asked about Pirates in Paradise, and Marty looked troubled. After thinking he said that it was kind of like Fantasy Fest but not-there were pirate parties, pirate encampments, historical demonstrations-and heck, a lot of swaggering and grog drinking, but people were welcome to wear costumes. They could see a mock trial of Anne Bonny, they could learn so much-and run around, saying arrgh, avast and ahoy all day if they liked.\\n\\n When the crowd finally began to thin around 3:00 a.m., Katie and Clarinda did a song together from Jekyll and Hyde, despite Clarinda’s objections. Her friend had a lovely, strong voice but didn’t believe it; she would only go up late at night and when it was fairly quiet, and only with Katie.\\n\\n The bar didn’t close up until 4:00 a.m., but Katie ended her karaoke at three, giving folks time to finish up and pay their bar tabs. After she had secured her equipment for the night-she only had to see that the karaoke computer and all her amps were covered and that her good microphones were locked away-she was ready to head home and to sleep. Clarinda stopped her at the door. “Hey, Jonas is coming by for me in an hour or so. We’ll walk you home. Hang around.”\\n\\n Katie shook her head. “I’m fine, honestly. I grew up here, remember? I know how to avoid drunks and-”\\n\\n “We actually get gangs down here now, you know,” Clarinda said firmly.\\n\\n “I’m going straight home. I’ll take Simonton, I won’t walk on Duval. I’ll be fine.”\\n\\n Clarinda remained unhappy, but Katie had no intention of being swayed. Her uncle was up in St. Augustine, and Jon Merrillo was managing the bar, so she intended to slip out without being stopped by anyone. On Saturday, she would officially take ownership of the Beckett family’s myth-and-legends museum, and she was tense and wanted to be anywhere but at work. “You watch yourself with those drunks!” she warned.\\n\\n “Oh, honey, if there’s one thing I learned while you were away at school, it’s how to handle drunks. Oh, wait! We both knew how to manage that before you left. Go. I’ll be fine. And Jonas will be here soon.”\\n\\n Waving and clutching her carryall, Katie left the bar.\\n\\n At 3:00 a.m., Duval Street was far from closed down. She wondered with a quirk of humor what DuVal-the first governor of territorial Florida-would have thought of the street named in his honor.\\n\\n Certainly, it kept the name from being forgotten.\\n\\n Key West was filled with history that shouldn’t be forgotten. The name itself was a bastardization of Cayo Hueso, Island of Bones, and came from the fact that hueso had sounded like west to the English-speaking British who had claimed the state from the Spaniards. The name fit because it was the most western of the Islands of the Martyrs, which was what the chain of Florida “keys” had been known as to the Spanish. Actually, the Islands of the Dry Tortugas were farther west, but the name had been given, and it had stuck. Street names came from the early Americans-Simonton and his friends, colleagues and their families. Simonton had purchased Key West from a Spaniard named Salas when Florida had become an American territory. Salas had received the island as a gift-or back payment for a debt-from the Spanish governor who had ruled before the American governor. The island had seen British rule as well, and often, no matter who ruled, it wasn’t ruled much at all.\\n\\n The place was colorful, throughout history, and now.\\n\\n “You do love this place,” Bartholomew noted as he walked alongside her.\\n\\n She shrugged. “It’s home. If you’re used to the beautiful fall colors in Massachusetts, that’s home. Down here, it’s the water, and the craziness. Yes, I do love it.”\\n\\n She stopped walking and stared across Simonton, frowning.\\n\\n “What?” Bartholomew asked her. “I see nothing. Not even the beauty in white who frets so night after night.”\\n\\n “Lights.”\\n\\n “Lights? They’re everywhere, and trust me, I can remember when they weren’t,” Bartholomew told her.\\n\\n “No! There are lights on in the entry at the old Beckett museum. My museum.”\\n\\n “You don’t officially own it until Saturday, or so you said.”\\n\\n “Right, I have a meeting at the bank on Saturday- Liam is going to come and help me-and I sign the final papers, but…”\\n\\n There shouldn’t have been anyone in the museum. Craig Beckett had passed away at eighty-eight almost a year ago, a dear man, one who might have lived forever. His health had been excellent. But his life had existed around a true love affair. When Leandra, his wife of sixty-plus years had passed away, he had never quite recovered. He hadn’t taken a pistol to his head or an overdose of prescription medication, he had simply lost his love for life. Liam Beckett, a friend of Katie’s since she had come back-they hadn’t been friends before, since Liam had graduated high school before she had started-had been the assumed executor of the estate, and he’d planned to tear the museum down rather than invest in repairing it. The place hadn’t been open in years; Katie had loved it as a child, and she had long dreamed of reopening it. She had talked Liam into agreeing. David Beckett, Liam’s cousin and coexecutor of the estate, hadn’t actually corresponded about the matter yet. He’d been working in Africa, Asia, Australia or somewhere far away for the past few years, and Liam was convinced that David wouldn’t care one way or another what happened to the place. It was unlikely he would remain in the Keys if he actually returned at all. Since David had left, almost ten years ago, he had never wanted to come home.\\n\\n His former fiancée, the great love of his life at the time, even though she had left him, had been murdered. Strangled. She was left there, in the family museum, posed in position as the legendary Elena Milagro de Hoyos.\\n\\n He’d been under suspicion. He’d had an alibi-his grandparents. That alibi had made some people suspicious. After all, what would his grandparents say? But he hadn’t run; he had waited through the beginning of the investigation, he had stayed in town until the case had gone cold and then he had left, never to return.\\n\\n Katie knew that some people thought that he should have been further investigated. She remembered him, but just vaguely. He’d been a big high-school sports star down here. Sean, her brother, had also loved sports. He was older and knew David Beckett better.\\n\\n Curious, Katie crossed the street. It was quiet; street-lamps illuminated the road itself, but here on Simonton the revelry taking place still on Duval was muted and seemed far away. She stared up at the building that housed the Beckett family museum.\\n\\n Originally, she knew, it hadn’t been chosen for any historical reason. The house was built in the late eighteen-fifties by Perry Shane. Shane had deserted it to fight for the Federals back in his native New Jersey. For years afterward, the house had just been one of many old places that needed work. The Beckett family had purchased it in the twenties because it had been cheap, a seventy-year-old fixer-upper. Now it was one of the grand dames of the street, mid-Victorian, boasting wraparound porches on both the first and second floors, and around the attic garret, a widow’s walk. Kate didn’t think anyone had ever really been able to see the water and incoming ships from the walk, but it had been a fashionable addition to the house at the time it had been built.\\n\\n Once, it had offered six bedrooms on the second floor and two in the attic. Downstairs had been the parlor, library, dining room, office and pantry. The kitchen had been out back about twenty feet away. There was also a carriage house. Now, when you entered through the front door, the gate and turnstiles were positioned there. The tour began on the second floor and wound around through the rooms, brought visitors down the servants’ stairway to the first floor and then around once again, back to the front.\\n\\n “What are you doing?” Bartholomew demanded, following her.\\n\\n “I want to know why there’s a light on,” Katie said.\\n\\n “Because someone is in there. And you don’t own it yet. It could be someone dangerous.”\\n\\n “It could be frat boys on a lark, and I’m getting them out of there before they do damage to the place. Craig Beckett might have closed it down a few years ago, but it still has all of the exhibits in place,” Katie said.\\n\\n “What if it’s not a frat boy?” Bartholomew protested. “Katie, don’t go in there.”\\n\\n “You’re with me. I’ll be fine.”\\n\\n “Katie! Awake and see the sunrise, lass! Me-ghost. I love to remember the days when I was strong and tough and could defend a girl with certainty and vigor. If you get into real trouble because the place is being pilfered or plundered by a criminal-”\\n\\n “Bartholomew, what thief turns on the lights?” Katie demanded.\\n\\n Bartholomew groaned. “A drunk one? Katie-!”\\n\\n Bartholomew groaned. Katie had jumped the low white-picket gate that surrounded the place.\\n\\n “Katie!”\\n\\n “What?”\\n\\n “Murder, murder most foul!” Bartholomew cried.\\n\\n He’d always been fond of quoting and paraphrasing Shakespeare.\\n\\n “Murderers do not turn the lights on!” she tossed over her shoulder in return.\\n\\n “How do you know?” he demanded\\n\\n She ignored him and walked up the limestone path that led to broad steps to the porch and the door.\\n\\n She felt him close behind her.\\n\\n Was she crazy? No! This was about to be her place, and she could speed-dial the police in two seconds. She wasn’t going in with lights blazing; she would see what was going on by lurking in the darkness. She knew the place.\\n\\n At the door she paused. She reached for the knob and as she did so, the door opened, creaking a bit, as if it had been pushed by a sudden wind. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-shadow-bone-island-trilogy-1/page-3.html","bookId":2286,"book":{"id":2286,"title":"Ghost Shadow (Bone Island Trilogy #1)","description":"Storyline: Ghost Shadow (Bone Island #1) \\n There are those who walk among us who are no longer alive, but not yet crossed over.
