His fingers squeezed tighter. “I’ve got news for you. The Miss Virtue act doesn’t work here in Eclipse Bay anymore. You screwed your image eight years ago when you provided Rafe Madison with his alibi. And what do you think will happen when word gets out that the two of you are negotiating the details of your aunt’s will over cozy little breakfasts at your folks’ place?” “You know, it won’t be as easy to knee you in the crotch tonight as it was the last time, because this skirt is much tighter than the one I had on that night. But I think I can manage it, and I will if you don’t let me go right now.” He released her and jumped back as if he’d just touched an electrically charged wire. “Bitch!” “I think this is about where I came in last time,” Rafe said from the shadows behind Perry. “But the big difference is that Hannah won’t have to walk home tonight. I’ve got my car.” “Madison.” Perry jerked around to face Rafe and then took another hasty step back. “This is a private conversation.” “I got the impression that Hannah didn’t want to continue it any longer.” Rafe glided forward with a deceptively lazy movement. His eyes never left Perry’s face. “Was I mistaken?” “This is none of your business.” Perry’s voice squeaked slightly. “If you touch me, I’ll file charges.” Alarmed by the glint of predatory anticipation in Rafe’s eyes, Hannah stepped quickly between the two men. “That’s enough, Rafe. Everything is under control.” “I know, but it would be sort of fun to bounce him around a little. Please?” “Rafe, I’m serious.” It occurred to her that in her career as a wedding consultant she had honed to a fine art the ability to nip embarrassing public scenes in the bud. Now she was standing in the middle of one that she herself had created. “I do not want anyone hurt here.” “I could take him somewhere else.” Rafe looked hopeful. “Pretty quiet down at Eclipse Arch this time of night. No one would hear him squawk.” “You’re crazy.” Perry backpedaled several more steps. “How dare you threaten me! Do you have any idea of just who is out there in that reception room? There’s a future U.S. senator out there. Not to mention a lot of other very important people.” “He’s right,” Hannah said firmly. “We do not want to cause a disturbance that will only result in embarrassment for all concerned.” “I don’t mind a little embarrassment,” Rafe assured her. “I’m a Madison.” “Stop threatening me,” Perry howled. “I didn’t threaten you.” Rafe looked at Hannah. “Did you hear me threaten him, Hannah?” She seized his arm. “You and I are leaving. Now. The main goal of the evening has been accomplished. Perry has just assured me that he will not stand in the way of Brad’s joint appointment at the institute. In fact, he will do everything he can to ensure that it goes through. Isn’t that right, Perry?” “I won’t be intimidated,” Perry said forcefully. “Furthermore, I am not in charge of the selection committee. You have to remember that.” “Sure, sure, we understand.” Rafe winked. “But just among the three of us, Brad McCallister’s appointment looks like a sure thing, right?” Perry cleared his throat and somehow managed to look down his nose even though he was at least three inches shorter than Rafe. “If Lydd goes through with his plans to endow a research fund here at the institute, and if he feels strongly about McCallister’s appointment, he will, of course, be able to bring a great deal of influence to bear on the matter.” Rafe glanced at Hannah. “Are you sure you don’t want me to bounce him around a bit?” “Positive. We don’t need lawsuits.” She tugged on his arm. It was like trying to hoist the anchor of a container ship by hand. Rafe gave Perry a look of wistful regret. “You know, you’re right about one thing, Decatur. When she starts in with the lectures and the good advice, she does sort of take all the fun out of things, doesn’t she?” “That’s enough, Madison.” Hannah gave up tugging, wrapped her hand around his arm, and leaned forward instead. “Whatever you say.” Without warning, Rafe suddenly reversed course, squeezing her hand against his side. Hannah, already off balance, with her fingers now trapped under his elbow, had to run a few steps to avoid being dragged. “Rafe.” “Sorry.” He slowed to a normal pace. “You okay?” “Of course I’m okay.” She shoved her hair out of her eyes and yanked hard on her skirt. “Let’s get out of here.” “I’m with you. I don’t think I’m going to become a big fan of political receptions. The speeches are boring and the food is bad.” For some inexplicable reason she started to laugh. Chapter 11 With the exception of a few stray chuckles, she had herself under control by the time they got outside. Rafe glanced at her as they walked to the far side of the lot where the Porsche was parked. “Told you he was still a jerk.” He opened the passenger door for her. “You were right.” She slanted him a quick glance. “How long were you lurking there in that hallway outside the rest rooms?” “Long enough to hear most of the conversation.” She paused, half in and half out of the cockpit. Then she straightened and went up on her toes. Leaning over the top of the car window, she brushed her mouth very quickly against his cheek. “It really was sweet of you to offer to beat Perry up for me,” she said. He lifted his fingers absently to the place where her lips had touched his skin. In the weak glare of the parking lot lamp his eyes were shadowed, impossibly enigmatic. “That’s me, a real sweet guy.” She stepped back quickly and sank into the rich leather upholstery. “But I really didn’t need rescuing.” “ ’Course not. You’re a Harte.” “And Perry is just a jerk with a temper who’s always looking for an angle.” Rafe folded his arms on the top of the window frame and looked down at her. “Got news for you. It wasn’t you I was trying to rescue back there.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1/page-31.html","bookId":1795,"book":{"id":1795,"title":"Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #1)","description":"Storyline: Eclipse Bay has grown and flourished on the rugged Oregon coast, where the shore can be rocky and forbidding, full of sharp cliffs and hidden coves.
