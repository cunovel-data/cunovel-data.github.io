The thought of a computer-generated wedding is really quite dreadful. It sounds so cold. Weddings are supposed to evoke all sorts of wonderful emotions, after all.” “Trust me, Mrs. Blankenship, behind the scenes, a well-managed wedding has a lot in common with a launch of the space shuttle.” “You know, dear, I hate to mention this, but you’ve become increasingly cynical ever since you ended your engagement last year. It’s so sad to see a young, healthy, vibrant woman like you turn jaded. Maybe you took on too much when you signed up for all those evening classes at the college.” “Mrs. Blankenship—” “You’ve been working much too hard for the past year. Perhaps you need a vacation. Go someplace where you can relax and regain your interest in your business and your social life.” “I have no social life to revive, Mrs. Blankenship. And as for my career, nothing will ever make me starry-eyed about my business. The only weddings that I actually enjoy doing are those in which I know for a fact that the couple met through my sister’s agency. At least I can feel reasonably confident that those marriages have a good chance of lasting.” “Yes, your sister does have a knack for matchmaking, doesn’t she?” Mrs. Blankenship got a dreamy expression in her eyes. “She obviously has a wonderful sense of intuition when it comes to that sort of thing.” “I hate to disillusion you, Mrs. Blankenship, but Lillian uses a computer, not her intuition.” Hannah dug her keys out of her massive shoulder bag. “Does Winston need a walk right away?” “No, dear, we just got back from our walkies,” Mrs. Blankenship said. “Great.” Hannah went to her own door and unlocked it, Winston trotting eagerly at her heels. “Thanks again, Mrs. Blankenship.” “Anytime, dear.” Mrs. Blankenship paused. “You know, you really should consider taking some time off. Your busy season is finished. You could slip away for a while.” “Funny you should mention that, Mrs. Blankenship. I was just thinking the same thing.” Mrs. Blankenship beamed. “I’m so glad to hear that. You really haven’t been quite the same since your engagement ended.” “Several people have mentioned that.” Hannah opened her door. “One theory is that I have been possessed by an alien entity.” “I beg your pardon?” “Never mind. Good night, Mrs. Blankenship.” “Good night, dear.” Hannah stepped into the small hallway, waited until Winston came inside, and then swiftly shut the door. She flipped on the lights. “Give me a minute to change, Winston. Then I’ll find us both something to eat.” In the bedroom she stripped off the jacket and skirt of her blue business suit, then pulled on a pair of black leggings and a cozy cowl-necked tunic and slipped into a pair of ballet-style flats. Pausing for a moment in front of the mirror, she brushed her hair behind her ears and anchored it with a narrow band. When she was ready, she padded back down the hall into the kitchen and dug one of the expensive, specially formulated dog bones out of a box for Winston. The Schnauzer took it very politely from her fingers. “Enjoy.” Winston needed no further urging. He set to work on the bone vigorously. Hannah opened the refrigerator and meditated on the sparse contents for a moment. After a while she removed a hunk of sheep’s-milk feta cheese and a nearly empty bottle of Chardonnay. She arranged her small haul on a tray and carried it into the second bedroom, where she maintained a home office. Winston followed, the remains of his bone wedged firmly between his jaws. Sinking down onto the high-backed chair, Hannah propped her feet on the corner of the desk and munched a cracker with some of the cheese on it. Winston took up his customary position on the floor beside the desk chair. Muted crunching sounds ensued. “Brace yourself, Winston.” Hannah reached for the phone. “I’m going to check my messages. Who knows what excitement awaits us?” The automated answering service surrendered three offerings. The first was from a florist, reporting that the orchids Hannah had ordered for the Cooke-Anderson wedding were going to cost more than expected. “I told the client that they would be expensive.” The second message was from her brother, Nick, letting her know that he had just mailed the manuscript of the most recent addition to his successful suspense series to the editor. “I’m taking Carson to Disneyland, and then we’re going on down to Phoenix to see Sullivan and Rachel. Probably be gone for most of the month. You know how to reach me if you need me.” “It’s about time he married again,” Hannah said to Winston. “Amelia has been gone for three years now. He and little Carson have been alone long enough.” Winston jiggled his brows. “Yes, I know. I’m a fine one to talk.” She punched the key for the last message… and nearly fell off her chair when she heard Rafe Madison’s unmistakable, bottom-of-the-sea voice. Her heels came down off the desk with a small thud. She sucked in a half-strangled breath and sat forward abruptly. The Chardonnay sloshed wildly in the glass. Several drops went over the rim and hit Winston between his ears. He looked up from his bone with a puzzled expression. “Sorry, Winston.” She grabbed a napkin and blotted the wine off the top of his head. “I was a little stunned there for a second, but I don’t think I’m going to faint or anything.” She tossed the napkin into the wastebasket, inhaled slowly, and took a steadying swallow of wine. She had not heard his voice in eight years, and although this time around it was only a recording, it had the same impact on her tonight as it had the last time. Small flashes of electrical energy snapped through her nerve endings. Her stomach seemed to float in midair. “This is Rafe Madison…” The last conversation she’d had with him flitted through her mind. Good luck with that five-year plan of yours. I hope things work out the way you want. She wondered if he’d ever gotten his act together. “. . . Got the message you sent through your lawyer. The answer is no. Looks like we’ve got a few things to talk about, and I don’t plan to do it through our attorneys. See you in Eclipse Bay.” “No?” The old memories went up in smoke and the present came crashing back. She stabbed the replay key.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1/page-8.html","bookId":1795,"book":{"id":1795,"title":"Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #1)","description":"Storyline: Eclipse Bay has grown and flourished on the rugged Oregon coast, where the shore can be rocky and forbidding, full of sharp cliffs and hidden coves. In Eclipse Bay by Jayne Ann Krentz, this small town is also filled with secrets as treacherous as the landscape and rivalries as fierce as an ocean storm. Their grandfathers hated each other. Their fathers hated each other. And as the next generation of the Hartes and Madisons, Hannah and Rafe are expected to hate each other too. But Hannah Harte, a successful wedding consultant with a skeptical view of marriage, remembers the long-ago night on the beach that revealed Rafe as much more than just \"that disreputable Madison boy.\" And Rafe remembers the heroic gesture that proved Hannah\u0027s fierce spirit was stronger than any feud and saved him from near-certain imprisonment. Now reunited by a surprising inheritance after years of living their separate lives, Rafe and Hannah return to Eclipse Bay, and the hostilities that still divide, and bind, their families. And they are discovering something that is at once delightful and deeply disturbing ... They don\u0027t hate each other. Not at all.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1.jpg","author":"Jayne Ann Krentz","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:38 PM"}}
