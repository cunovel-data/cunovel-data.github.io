If things work out with the Private Arrangements agency, I’ll be celebrating some anniversaries myself one of these days.”\n “Something tells me it won’t be that simple,” Rafe warned. “You’re a Madison, remember? We don’t do simple when it comes to marriage. We always do things the hard way.”\n “Only when we make the mistake of letting emotion take over. I don’t plan to make that mistake.”\n “Good luck.” Rafe disconnected, tossed the phone onto the table, and rolled back toward Hannah.\n That was when he realized that his left wrist was bound to the red wrought-iron bed frame. He studied the familiar-looking padded handcuff Hannah had used to chain him with great interest.\n “Where’d you get the cuffs?” he asked.\n “I bought them from Virgil.” She held up the second cuff. “An anniversary present.”\n “Oh, my.” Rafe smiled slowly. “Don’t know if I can handle so much excitement.”\n “Something tells me you’re up to the challenge.”\n “I’ll do my best.” He reached out for her with his free hand and pulled her down across his chest. “I love you, Hannah.”\n “I love you, too.”\n He speared his fingers through her hair. “Should have married you eight years ago.”\n “Maybe. Maybe not. I think we both needed time to decide what we wanted out of life.”\n “You could be right.” He thought about that for a few seconds. “I told you that night that it would be a long walk home.”\n “Yes, you did.” She brushed her lips across his. “But we both got here safely. That’s all that matters.”\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1/page-80.html","bookId":1795,"book":{"id":1795,"title":"Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Eclipse Bay has grown and flourished on the rugged Oregon coast, where the shore can be rocky and forbidding, full of sharp cliffs and hidden coves. In Eclipse Bay by Jayne Ann Krentz, this small town is also filled with secrets as treacherous as the landscape and rivalries as fierce as an ocean storm. \n Their grandfathers hated each other. \n Their fathers hated each other. \n And as the next generation of the Hartes and Madisons, Hannah and Rafe are expected to hate each other too. But Hannah Harte, a successful wedding consultant with a skeptical view of marriage, remembers the long-ago night on the beach that revealed Rafe as much more than just \"that disreputable Madison boy.\" And Rafe remembers the heroic gesture that proved Hannah\u0027s fierce spirit was stronger than any feud and saved him from near-certain imprisonment. \n Now reunited by a surprising inheritance after years of living their separate lives, Rafe and Hannah return to Eclipse Bay, and the hostilities that still divide, and bind, their families. And they are discovering something that is at once delightful and deeply disturbing ... \n They don\u0027t hate each other. Not at all.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1.jpg","author":"Jayne Ann Krentz","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:38 PM"}}
