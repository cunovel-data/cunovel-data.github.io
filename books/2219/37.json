Because he knew he could count on your—let’s call it your strong entrepreneurial spirit—to make his plan work.” “Are you saying I had something to do with this?” Saranne moved closer to our table, obviously eavesdropping while pretending not to. I spoke a little louder for her benefit. “If you had said no, Mr. Mayor, none of this would have happened.” “I did what I thought was best for the town.” “Everyone on the city council thought it was a good idea,” Tracie said. “The Imposter was counting on that. I wonder how he knew that he could.” When neither of them replied, I filled in the silence that followed. “Miller, how much time did you spend with the Imposter?” “I know where you’re going with this, McKenzie. Chief Gustafson told me you thought Rush had an accomplice. Someone from Libbie. It ain’t me.” From now on, let’s not tell the chief any more than we have to, my inner voice told me. “The Imposter needed a password to loot the escrow account. You’re one of six people who knew the password.” “It ain’t me.” “That doesn’t answer my question,” I said aloud. “How much time—” “Very little. I spent very little time with him.” “Oh?” “We spoke. We spoke a lot. It’s not like we were friends, though.” “What did you speak about?” “The mall.” “What else?” “Just the mall.” “Did you ever have him over for dinner?” “Yes. Once.” “Did he meet the family?” “Leave my family out of this.” “What did you speak about then?” “The mall.” “Okay.” “You don’t believe me.” “Are you going to pay the town back for any of the money that they lost on this deal?” “What? No. Why would I?” “Could you pay it back if you had to?” “What is that supposed to mean?” “We live in uncertain economic times. Maybe you’re overextended. Maybe you need extra cash.” “I told you—” Miller stopped himself and closed his eyes. I never saw anyone actually count to ten before. When he opened his eyes, he said, “I will not be provoked.” I didn’t believe him. Miller stood slowly. Saranne was several tables behind him. She abruptly turned her back and moved away. “You’re looking for an accomplice,” Miller said. “That’s fine. You keep doing that. You’ll tell me when you find him.” It was a command, not a question. Miller seemed surprised when I smiled disdainfully and shook my head. “What’s the magic word?” I said. “Excuse me?” “No, but it’s close.” Miller’s eyes swept from me to Tracie and back again. “Are you trying to be funny?” “Here’s the thing, Miller,” I said. “I don’t work for you. I don’t like you. So either be polite, or fuck you.” “McKenzie,” Tracie said. “People don’t talk to me like that,” Miller said. “Maybe if they did, their town wouldn’t be on the brink of bankruptcy.” “McKenzie, please,” Tracie said. “I changed my mind,” Miller said. “I think you should leave Libbie. The sooner the better.” “I don’t care what you think,” I said. Miller stared at me as if I were an accident alongside the road. After a few moments, he shook his head slightly. “I will not be provoked.” He turned and walked away. “McKenzie, what are you doing?” Tracie wanted to know. “Mr. Miller is an important man in this town. Probably the most important.” “Who says?” “I say. What was the point of insulting him like that?” “Patience,” I said. Saranne didn’t return to the table until Miller was long gone. When she did, she immediately began retrieving plates. “How was the burger?” she said. “Lousy,” I told her. “You really have to come in at night. The old man actually pays for a real cook then. He has specials, the cook. I get to sample them, so I can tell you what’s good. Otherwise, you’ll want to order the ribs. Our cook makes great ribs. Rush said they reminded him of the ribs you can get at Taste of Minnesota.” “He said that?” “Uh-huh. Rush said every year around the Fourth of July he would go to Grant Park for Taste of Minnesota, and he always made a point of eating the ribs. You’re from the Cities. Do you ever go to Taste of Minnesota?” “Often.” “Are the ribs good?” “Yes, they are.” “At least he told the truth about one thing.” “Did you spend much time with Rush?” “Not as much time as people say I did.” She glanced at Tracie. “Do you need anything else? Dessert?” “Do you recommend dessert?” I said. Saranne shook her head and smiled. “No.” “Well, then…”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-taking-of-libbie-sd-mac-mckenzie-7/page-37.html","bookId":2219,"book":{"id":2219,"title":"The Taking of Libbie, SD (Mac McKenzie #7)","description":"Storyline: A grifter cons an entire town using McKenzieâ€™s name, leaving the real McKenzie facing an angry town with nothing left to lose Â Rushmore McKenzie is a retired cop, an unexpected millionaire, and an occasional unlicensed private investigator.
