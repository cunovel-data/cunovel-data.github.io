S. D. \n \n Oh that’s the land of Liberty! \n \n But how shall I get there? \n \n “Straight down the Crooked Lane, \n \n And all round the Square,” \n \n I’ve dreamt about some blessed spot, \n \n Beneath the blessed sky, \n \n Where Bread and Justice never rise \n \n Too dear for folks to buy. \n \n It’s cheaper than the Ward of Cheap, \n \n But how shall I get there? \n \n “Straight down the Crooked Lane, \n \n And all round the Square.” \n \n They say there is an ancient House, \n \n As pure as it is old, \n \n Where Members always speak their minds \n \n And votes are never sold. \n \n I’m fond of all antiquities, \n \n But how shall I get there? \n \n “Straight down the Crooked Lane, \n \n And all round the Square.” \n \n They say there is a Royal Court \n \n Maintain’d in noble state, \n \n Where ev’ry able man, and good, \n \n Is certain to be great! \n \n I’m very fond of seeing sights, \n \n But how shall I get there? \n \n “Straight down the Crooked Lane, \n \n And all round the Square.” \n \n They say there is a Temple too, \n \n Where Christians come to pray; \n \n But canting knaves and hypocrites, \n \n And bigots keep away. \n \n Oh that’s the parish church for me! \n \n But how shall I get there? \n \n “Straight down the Crooked Lane, \n \n And all round the Square.” \n \n They say there is a Garden fair, \n \n That’s haunted by the dove, \n \n Where love of gold doth ne’er eclipse \n \n The golden light of love — \n \n The place must be a Paradise, \n \n But how shall I get there? \n \n “Straight down the Crooked Lane, \n \n And all round the Square.” \n \n I’ve heard there is a famous Land \n \n For public spirit known — \n \n Whose Patriots love its interests \n \n Much better than their own. \n \n The Land of Promise sure it is! \n \n But how shall I get there? \n \n “Straight down the Crooked Lane, \n \n And all round the Square.” \n \n I’ve read about a fine Estate, \n \n A Mansion large and strong; \n \n A view all over Kent and back, \n \n And going for a song. \n \n George Robins knows the very spot, \n \n But how shall I get there? \n \n “Straight down the Crooked Lane, \n \n And all round the Square.” \n \n I’ve heard there is a Company \n \n All formal and enroll’d, \n \n Will take your smallest silver coin \n \n And give it back in gold. \n \n Of course the office door is mobb’d, \n \n But how shall I get there? \n \n “Straight down the Crooked Lane, \n \n And all round the Square.” \n \n I’ve heard about a pleasant Land, \n \n Where omelettes grow on trees, \n \n And roasted pigs run crying out, \n \n “Come eat me, if you please.” \n \n My appetite is rather keen, \n \n But how shall I get there? \n \n “Straight down the Crooked Lane, \n \n And all round the Square.” \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37871.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
