Oh, ’tis a touching thing, to make one weep — A tender infant with its curtain’d eye, Breathing as it would neither live nor die With that unchanging countenance of sleep! As if its silent dream, serene and deep, Had lined its slumber with a still blue sky So that the passive cheeks unconscious lie With no more life than roses — just to keep The blushes warm, and the mild, odorous breath. O blossom boy! so calm is thy repose. So sweet a compromise of life and death, ’Tis pity those fair buds should e’er unclose For memory to stain their inward leaf, Tinging thy dreams with unacquainted grief. 2.
