In Middle Row, some years ago, There lived one Mr. Brown; And many folks considered him The stoutest man in town. But Brown and stout will both wear out — One Friday he died hard, And left a widow’d wife to mourn, At twenty pence a yard. Now widow B. in two short months Thought mourning quite a tax; And wished, like Mr. Wilberforce, To manumit her blacks. With Mr. Street she soon was sweet; The thing came thus about: She asked him in at home, and then At church, he asked her out! Assurance such as this the man In ashes could not stand; So like a Phoenix he rose up Against the Hand in Hand! One dreary night the angry sprite Appeared before her view; It came a little after one, But she was after two! “O Mrs. B., O Mrs. B.! Are these your sorrow’s deeds, Already getting up a flame, To burn your widows’ weeds? “It’s not so long since I have left For aye the mortal scene; My memory — like Rogers’s — Should still be bound in green! “Yet if my face you still retrace, I almost have a doubt — I’m like an old Forget-me-not, With all the leaves torn out! “To think that on that finger joint Another pledge should cling; O Bess! upon my very soul It struck like ‘Knock and Ring,’” “A ton of marble on my breast Can’t hinder my return; Your conduct, ma’am, has set my blood A-boiling in my urn!” “Remember, oh! remember, how The marriage rite did run — If ever we one flesh should be ’Tis now — when I have none! “And you, Sir — once a bosom friend — Of perjured faith convict, As ghostly toe can give no blow, Consider you are kick’d. “A hollow voice is all I have, But this I tell you plain, Marry come up! — you marry, ma’am, And I’ll come up again.” More he had said, but chanticleer The spritely shade did shock With sudden crow — and off he went, Like fowling-piece at cock!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37425.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
