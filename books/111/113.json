A pretty task, Miss S— — to ask A Benedictine pen, That cannot quite at freedom write Like those of other men. No lover’s plaint my muse must paint To fill this page’s span, But be correct and recollect I’m not a single man. Pray only think, for pen and ink How hard to get along, That may not turn on words that burn Or Love, the life of song! Nine Muses, if I chooses, I May woo all in a clan, But one Miss S—— I daren’t address — I’m not a single man. Scribblers unwed, with little head May eke it out with heart, And in their lays it often plays A rare first-fiddle part. They make a kiss to rhyme with bliss, But if I so began, I have my fears about my ears — I’m not a single man. Upon your cheek I may not speak, Nor on your lip be warm, I must be wise about your eyes, And formal with your form; Of all that sort of thing, in short, On T.H. Bayly’s plan, I must not twine a single line — I’m not a single man. A watchman’s part compels my heart To keep you off its beat, And I might dare as soon to swear At you, as at your feet. I can’t expire in passion’s fire As other poets can — My life (she’s by) won’t let me die — I’m not a single man. Shut out from love, denied a dove, Forbidden bow and dart, Without a groan to call my own, With neither hand nor heart; To Hymen vow’d, and not allow’d To flirt e’en with your fan, Here end, as just a friend, I must — I’m not a single man.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37419.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
