Bayly’s plan, \\n\\n \\n\\n I must not twine a single line — \\n\\n \\n\\n I’m not a single man. \\n\\n \\n\\n A watchman’s part compels my heart \\n\\n \\n\\n To keep you off its beat, \\n\\n \\n\\n And I might dare as soon to swear \\n\\n \\n\\n At you, as at your feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n I can’t expire in passion’s fire \\n\\n \\n\\n As other poets can — \\n\\n \\n\\n My life (she’s by) won’t let me die — \\n\\n \\n\\n I’m not a single man. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shut out from love, denied a dove, \\n\\n \\n\\n Forbidden bow and dart, \\n\\n \\n\\n Without a groan to call my own, \\n\\n \\n\\n With neither hand nor heart; \\n\\n \\n\\n To Hymen vow’d, and not allow’d \\n\\n \\n\\n To flirt e’en with your fan, \\n\\n \\n\\n Here end, as just a friend, I must — \\n\\n \\n\\n I’m not a single man. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37419.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
