Bayly’s plan, \n \n I must not twine a single line — \n \n I’m not a single man. \n \n A watchman’s part compels my heart \n \n To keep you off its beat, \n \n And I might dare as soon to swear \n \n At you, as at your feet. \n \n I can’t expire in passion’s fire \n \n As other poets can — \n \n My life (she’s by) won’t let me die — \n \n I’m not a single man. \n \n Shut out from love, denied a dove, \n \n Forbidden bow and dart, \n \n Without a groan to call my own, \n \n With neither hand nor heart; \n \n To Hymen vow’d, and not allow’d \n \n To flirt e’en with your fan, \n \n Here end, as just a friend, I must — \n \n I’m not a single man. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37419.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
