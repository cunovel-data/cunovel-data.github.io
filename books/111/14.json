Autumn.","content":"I saw old Autumn in the misty morn \n \n Stand shadowless like Silence, listening \n \n To silence, for no lonely bird would sing \n \n Into his hollow ear from woods forlorn, \n \n Nor lowly hedge nor solitary thorn; \n \n Shaking his languid locks all dewy bright \n \n With tangled gossamer that fell by night, \n \n Pearling his coronet of golden corn. \n \n Where are the songs of Summer? — With the sun, \n \n Opening the dusky eyelids of the south, \n \n Till shade and silence waken up as one, \n \n And Morning sings with a warm odorous mouth. \n \n Where are the merry birds? — Away, away, \n \n On panting wings through the inclement skies, \n \n Lest owls should prey \n \n Undazzled at noon-day, \n \n And tear with horny beak their lustrous eyes. \n \n Where are the blooms of Summer? — In the west, \n \n Blushing their last to the last sunny hours. \n \n When the mild Eve by sudden Night is prest \n \n Like tearful Proserpine, snatch’d from her flow’rs \n \n To a most gloomy breast. \n \n Where is the pride of Summer — the green prime — \n \n The many, many leaves all twinkling? — Three \n \n On the moss’d elm; three on the naked lime \n \n Trembling — and one upon the old oak tree! \n \n Where is the Dryad’s immortality? — \n \n Gone into mournful cypress and dark yew, \n \n Or wearing the long gloomy Winter through \n \n In the smooth holly’s green eternity. \n \n The squirrel gloats on his accomplish’d hoard, \n \n The ants have brimm’d their garners with ripe grain, \n \n And honey been save stored \n \n The sweets of summer in their luscious cells; \n \n The swallows all have wing’d across the main; \n \n But here the Autumn melancholy dwells, \n \n And sighs her tearful spells \n \n Amongst the sunless shadows of the plain. \n \n Alone, alone, \n \n Upon a mossy stone, \n \n She sits and reckons up the dead and gone, \n \n With the last leaves for a love-rosary; \n \n Whilst all the wither’d world looks drearily, \n \n Like a dim picture of the drown?d past \n \n In the hush’d mind’s mysterious far-away, \n \n Doubtful what ghostly thing will steal the last \n \n Into that distance, gray upon the gray. \n \n O go and sit with her, and be o’ershaded \n \n Under the languid downfall of her hair; \n \n She wears a coronal of flowers faded \n \n Upon her forehead, and a face of care; — \n \n There is enough of wither’d everywhere \n \n To make her bower — and enough of gloom; \n \n There is enough of sadness to invite, \n \n If only for the rose that died, whose doom \n \n Is Beauty’s — she that with the living bloom \n \n Of conscious cheeks most beautifies the light: \n \n There is enough of sorrowing, and quite \n \n Enough of bitter fruits the earth doth bear — \n \n Enough of chilly droppings from her bowl; \n \n Enough of fear and shadowy despair, \n \n To frame her cloudy prison for the soul! \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/36789.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
