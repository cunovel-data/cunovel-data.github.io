O William dear! \\n\\n \\n\\n My rest eternal ceases; \\n\\n \\n\\n Alas! my everlasting peace \\n\\n \\n\\n Is broken into pieces. \\n\\n \\n\\n I thought the last of all my cares \\n\\n \\n\\n Would end with my last minute; \\n\\n \\n\\n But though I went to my long home, \\n\\n \\n\\n I didn’t stay long in it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The body-snatchers they have come, \\n\\n \\n\\n And made a snatch at me; \\n\\n \\n\\n It’s very hard them kind of men \\n\\n \\n\\n Won’t let a body be! \\n\\n \\n\\n You thought that I was buried deep, \\n\\n \\n\\n Quite decent-like and chary, \\n\\n \\n\\n But from her grave in Mary-bone, \\n\\n \\n\\n They’ve come and boned your Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n The arm that used to take your arm \\n\\n \\n\\n Is took to Dr. Vyse; \\n\\n \\n\\n And both my legs are gone to walk \\n\\n \\n\\n The hospital at Guy’s. \\n\\n \\n\\n I vowed that you should have my hand, \\n\\n \\n\\n But fate gives us denial; \\n\\n \\n\\n You’ll find it there, at Dr. Bell’s, \\n\\n \\n\\n In spirits and a phial. \\n\\n \\n\\n As for my feet, the little feet \\n\\n \\n\\n You used to call so pretty, \\n\\n \\n\\n There’s one, I know, in Bedford Row, \\n\\n \\n\\n The t’other’s in the City. \\n\\n \\n\\n I can’t tell where my head is gone, \\n\\n \\n\\n But Doctor Carpue can; \\n\\n \\n\\n As for my trunk, it’s all packed up \\n\\n \\n\\n To go by Pickford’s van. \\n\\n \\n\\n I wish you’d go to Mr. P. \\n\\n \\n\\n And save me such a ride; \\n\\n \\n\\n I don’t half like the outside place, \\n\\n \\n\\n They’ve took for my inside. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cock it crows — I must be gone! \\n\\n \\n\\n My William, we must part! \\n\\n \\n\\n But I’ll be yours in death, altho’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir Astley has my heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don’t go to weep upon my grave, \\n\\n \\n\\n And think that there I be; \\n\\n \\n\\n They haven’t left an atom there \\n\\n \\n\\n Of my anatomie. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37895.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
