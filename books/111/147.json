no, wretch, I scorn it!” \n \n But Hunks still asked to see the tooth, \n \n And swore by gum! he had not drawn it. \n \n His end obtained, he took his leave, \n \n A secret chuckle in his sleeve; \n \n The joke was worthy to produce one, \n \n To think, by favor of his wit \n \n How well a dentist had been bit \n \n By one old stump, and that a loose one! \n \n The thing was worth a laugh, but mirth \n \n Is still the frailest thing on earth: \n \n Alas! how often when a joke \n \n Seems in our sleeve, and safe enough, \n \n There comes some unexpected stroke \n \n And hangs a weeper on the cuff! \n \n Hunks had not whistled half a mile, \n \n When, planted right against a stile, \n \n There stood his foeman, Mike Mahoney, \n \n A vagrant reaper, Irish born, \n \n That helped to reap our miser’s corn, \n \n But had not helped to reap his money, \n \n A fact that Hunks remembered quickly; \n \n His whistle all at once was quelled, \n \n And when he saw how Michael held \n \n His sickle, he felt rather sickly. \n \n Nine souls in ten, with half his fright, \n \n Would soon have paid the bill at sight, \n \n But misers (let observers watch it) \n \n Will never part with their delight \n \n Till well demanded by a hatchet — \n \n They live hard — and they die to match it. \n \n Thus Hunks prepared for Mike’s attacking, \n \n Resolved not yet to pay the debt, \n \n But let him take it out in hacking; \n \n However, Mike began to stickle \n \n In words before he used the sickle; \n \n But mercy was not long attendant: \n \n From words at last he took to blows, \n \n And aimed a cut at Hunks’s nose, \n \n That made it what some folks are not — \n \n A member very independent. \n \n Heaven knows how far this cruel trick \n \n Might still have led, but for a tramper \n \n That came in danger’s very nick, \n \n To put Mahoney to the scamper. \n \n But still compassion met a damper; \n \n There lay the severed nose, alas! \n \n Beside the daisies on the grass, \n \n “Wee, crimson-tipt” as well as they, \n \n According to the poet’s lay: \n \n And there stood Hunks, no sight for laughter. \n \n Away went Hodge to get assistance, \n \n With nose in hand, which Hunks ran after, \n \n But somewhat at unusual distance. \n \n In many a little country place \n \n It is a very common case \n \n To have but one residing doctor, \n \n Whose practice rather seems to be \n \n No practice, but a rule of three, \n \n Physician — surgeon — drug-decoctor; \n \n Thus Hunks was forced to go once more \n \n Where he had ta’en his to t’ before. \n \n His mere name made the learned man hot — \n \n “What! Hunks again within my door! \n \n I’ll pull his nose”; quoth Hunks, “You cannot.” \n \n The doctor looked and saw the case \n \n Plain as the nose not on his face. \n \n “Oh! hum — ha — yes — I understand.” \n \n But then arose a long demur, \n \n For not a finger would he stir \n \n Till he was paid his fee in hand; \n \n That matter settled, there they were, \n \n With Hunks well strapped upon his chair. \n \n The opening of a surgeon’s job — \n \n His tools, a chestful or a drawerful — \n \n Are always something very awful, \n \n And give the heart the strangest throb; \n \n But never patient in his funks \n \n Looked half so like a ghost as Hunks, \n \n Or surgeon half so like a devil \n \n Prepared for some infernal revel: \n \n His huge black eye kept rolling, rolling, \n \n Just like a bolus in a box: \n \n His fury seemed above controlling, \n \n He bellowed like a hunted ox: \n \n “Now, swindling wretch, I’ll show thee how \n \n We treat such cheating knaves as thou; \n \n Oh! sweet is this revenge to sup; \n \n I have thee by the nose — it’s now \n \n My turn — and I will turn it up.” \n \n Guess how the miser liked the scurvy \n \n And cruel way of venting passion; \n \n The snubbing folks in this new fashion \n \n Seemed quite to turn him topsy-turvy; \n \n He uttered prayers, and groans, and curses, \n \n For things had often gone amiss \n \n And wrong with him before, but this \n \n Would be the worst of all reverses! \n \n In fancy he beheld his snout \n \n Turned upwards like a pitcher’s spout; \n \n There was another grievance yet, \n \n And fancy did not fail to show it, \n \n That he must throw a summerset, \n \n Or stand upon his head to blow it. \n \n And was there then no argument \n \n To change the doctor’s vile intent, \n \n And move his pity? — yes, in truth, \n \n And that was — paying for the tooth. \n \n “Zounds! pay for such a stump! I’d rather —” \n \n But here the menace went no farther, \n \n For with his other ways of pinching, \n \n Hunks had a miser’s love of snuff. \n \n A recollection strong enough \n \n To cause a very serious flinching; \n \n In short, he paid and had the feature \n \n Replaced as it was meant by nature; \n \n For tho’ by this ’twas cold to handle \n \n (No corpse’s could have felt so horrid), \n \n And white just like an naked candle, \n \n The doctor deemed and proved it too, \n \n That noses from the nose will do \n \n As well as noses from the forehead; \n \n So, fixed by din of rag and lint, \n \n The part was bandaged up and muffled. \n \n The chair unfastened, Hunks rose, \n \n And shuffled off, for once unshuffled; \n \n And as he went, these words he snuffled — \n \n “Well, this is ‘paying thro’ the nose.’” \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37879.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
