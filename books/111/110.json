For it does not accord with my notions, Wrist, elbow, and chine, Stiff from throwing the line, To take nothing at last by my motions! I ground-bait my way as I go, And dip in at each watery dimple; But however I wish To inveigle the fish, To my gentle they will not play simple! Though my float goes so swimmingly on, My bad luck never seems to diminish; It would seem that the Bream Must be scarce in the stream, And the Chub, tho’ it’s chubby, be thinnish! Not a Trout there can be in the place, Not a Grayling or Rud worth the mention, And although at my hook With attention I look, I can ne’er see my hook with a Tench on! At a brandling once Gudgeon would gape, But they seem upon different terms now; Have they taken advice Of the ”Council of Nice,” And rejected their ”Diet of Worms,” now? In vain my live minnow I spin, Not a Pike seems to think it worth snatching; For the gut I have brought, I had better have bought A good rope that was used to Jack-ketching! Not a nibble has ruffled my cork, It is vain in this river to search then; I may wait till it’s night, Without any bite And at roost-time have never a Perch then! No Roach can I meet with — no Bleak, Save what in the air is so sharp now; Not a Dace have I got, And I fear it is not “Carpe diem,” a day for the Carp now! Oh! there is not a one-pound prize To be got in this fresh-water-lottery! What then can I deem Of so fishless a stream But that ’tis — like St. Mary’s —Ottery! For an Eel I have learned how to try, By a method of Walton’s own showing — But a fisherman feels Little prospect of Eels, In a path that’s devoted to towing! I have tried all the water for miles, Till I’m weary of dipping and casting, And hungry and faint — Let the Fancy just paint What it is, without Fish, to be Fasting! And the rain drizzles down very fast, While my dinner-time sounds from a far bell — So, wet to the skin, I’ll e’en back to my inn, Where at least I am sure of a Bar-bell!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37416.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
