Bill Blossom was a nice young man, And drove the Bury coach; But bad companions were his bane, And egg’d him on to poach. They taught him how to net the birds, And how to noose the hare; And with a wiry terrier, He often set a snare. Each “shiny night” the moon was bright, To park, preserve, and wood He went, and kept the game alive, By killing all he could. Land-owners, who had rabbits, swore That he had this demerit — Give him an inch of warren, he Would take a yard of ferret. At partridges he was not nice; And many, large and small, Without Hall’s powder, without lead, Were sent to Leaden Hall. He did not fear to take a deer From forest, park, or lawn; And without courting lord or duke, Used frequently to fawn. Folks who had hares discovered snares — His course they could not stop: No barber he, and yet he made Their hares a perfect crop. To pheasant he was such a foe, He tried the keepers’ nerves; They swore he never seem’d to have Jam satis of preserves. The Shooter went to beat, and found No sporting worth a pin, Unless he tried the covers made Of silver, plate, or tin. In Kent the game was little worth, In Surrey not a button; The Speaker said he often tried The Manors about Button. No county from his tricks was safe; In each he tried his lucks, And when the keepers were in Beds, He often was at Bucks. And when he went to Bucks, alas! They always came to Herts; And even Oxon used to wish That he had his deserts. But going to his usual Hants, Old Cheshire laid his plots: He got entrapp’d by legal Berks, And lost his life in Notts.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37433.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
