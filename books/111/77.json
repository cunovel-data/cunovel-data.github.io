I have walk’d through life \n \n Too heedless where I trod; \n \n Nay, helping to trample my fellow-worm, \n \n And fill the burial sod — \n \n Forgetting that even the sparrow falls \n \n Not unmark’d of God! \n \n “I drank the richest draughts; \n \n And ate whatever is good — \n \n Fish, and flesh, and fowl, and fruit, \n \n Supplied my hungry mood; \n \n But I never remember’d the wretched ones \n \n That starve for want of food! \n \n “I dress’d as the noble dress, \n \n In cloth of silver and gold, \n \n With silk, and satin, and costly furs, \n \n In many an ample fold; \n \n But I never remember’d the naked limbs \n \n That froze with winter’s cold. \n \n “The wounds I might have heal’d! \n \n The human sorrow and smart! \n \n And yet it never was in my soul \n \n To play so ill a part: \n \n But evil is wrought by want of Thought, \n \n As well as want of Heart!” \n \n She clasp’d her fervent hands, \n \n And the tears began to stream; \n \n Large, and bitter, and fast they fell, \n \n Remorse was so extreme; \n \n And yet, oh yet, that many a Dame \n \n Would dream the Lady’s Dream! \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37285.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
