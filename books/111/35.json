Before the leaf \n \n Is commonly abroad, in his piled sheaf \n \n The flagging poppies lose their ancient flame. \n \n No sweet there is, no pleasure I can name, \n \n But he will sip it first — before the lees. \n \n ’Tis his to taste rich honey — ere the bees \n \n Are busy with the brooms. He may forestall \n \n June’s rosy advent for his coronal; \n \n Before th’ expectant buds upon the bough, \n \n Twining his thoughts to bloom upon his brow. \n \n Oh! blest to see the flower in its seed, \n \n Before its leafy presence; for indeed \n \n Leaves are but wings on which the summer flies, \n \n And each thing perishable fades and dies, \n \n Escap’d in thought; but his rich thinkings be \n \n Like overflows of immortality: \n \n So that what there is steep’d shall perish never, \n \n But live and bloom, and be a joy forever. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/36810.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
