O, Nelly Gray! \n \n Is this your love so warm? \n \n The love that loves a scarlet coat \n \n Should be more uniform!” \n \n Said she, “I loved a soldier once, \n \n For he was blithe and brave; \n \n But I will never have a man \n \n With both legs in the grave!” \n \n “Before you had those timber toes, \n \n Your love I did allow, \n \n But then, you know, you stand upon \n \n Another footing now!” \n \n “O, Nelly Gray! O, Nelly Gray! \n \n For all your jeering speeches, \n \n At duty’s call, I left my legs \n \n In Badajos’s breaches!“ \n \n “Why, then,” said she, “you’ve lost the feet \n \n Of legs in war’s alarms, \n \n And now you cannot wear your shoes \n \n Upon your feats of arms!” \n \n “O, false and fickle Nelly Gray! \n \n I know why you refuse:— \n \n Though I’ve no feet — some other man \n \n Is standing in my shoes!” \n \n “I wish I ne’er had seen your face; \n \n But, now, a long farewell! \n \n For you will be my death:— alas! \n \n You will not be my Nell!“ \n \n Now when he went from Nelly Gray, \n \n His heart so heavy got — \n \n And life was such a burthen grown, \n \n It made him take a knot! \n \n So round his melancholy neck \n \n A rope he did entwine, \n \n And, for his second time in life, \n \n Enlisted in the Line! \n \n One end he tied around a beam, \n \n And then removed his pegs, \n \n And, as his legs were off — of course, \n \n He soon was off his legs! \n \n And there he hung, till he was dead \n \n As any nail in town — \n \n For though distress had cut him up, \n \n It could not cut him down! \n \n A dozen men sat on his corpse, \n \n To find out why he died — \n \n And they buried Ben in four cross-roads, \n \n With a stake in his inside! \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37309.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
