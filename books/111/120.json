Oh life! My home! and those that made it sweet: \n \n Ere I could pray, the torrent lay beneath my very feet. \n \n With frightful whirl, more swift than thought, I passed the dizzy edge, \n \n Bound after bound, with hideous bruise, I dashed from ledge to ledge, \n \n From crag to crag — in speechless pain — from midnight deep to deep; \n \n I did not die, but anguish stunn’d my senses into sleep. \n \n How long entranced, or whither dived, no clue I have to find: \n \n At last the gradual light of life came dawning o’er my mind; \n \n And through my brain there thrill’d a cry — a cry as shrill as birds \n \n Of vulture or of eagle kind, but this was set to words: \n \n “It’s Edgar Huntley? in his cap and nightgown, I declares! \n \n He’s been a-walking in his sleep, and pitch’d all down the stairs!” \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37426.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
