Oh life! My home! and those that made it sweet: \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere I could pray, the torrent lay beneath my very feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n With frightful whirl, more swift than thought, I passed the dizzy edge, \\n\\n \\n\\n Bound after bound, with hideous bruise, I dashed from ledge to ledge, \\n\\n \\n\\n From crag to crag — in speechless pain — from midnight deep to deep; \\n\\n \\n\\n I did not die, but anguish stunn’d my senses into sleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n How long entranced, or whither dived, no clue I have to find: \\n\\n \\n\\n At last the gradual light of life came dawning o’er my mind; \\n\\n \\n\\n And through my brain there thrill’d a cry — a cry as shrill as birds \\n\\n \\n\\n Of vulture or of eagle kind, but this was set to words: \\n\\n \\n\\n “It’s Edgar Huntley? in his cap and nightgown, I declares! \\n\\n \\n\\n He’s been a-walking in his sleep, and pitch’d all down the stairs!” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37426.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
