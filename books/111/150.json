D.‘s beyond the Border, \\n\\n \\n\\n To make them for some months eternal, \\n\\n \\n\\n Were entered monthly in a journal, \\n\\n \\n\\n That many a northern sage still writes in, \\n\\n \\n\\n And throws his little Northern Lights in, \\n\\n \\n\\n And proves and proves about the phrenos, \\n\\n \\n\\n A great deal more than I or he knows: \\n\\n \\n\\n How Music suffers, par exemple, \\n\\n \\n\\n By wearing tight hats round the temple; \\n\\n \\n\\n What ills great boxers have to fear \\n\\n \\n\\n From blisters put behind the ear; \\n\\n \\n\\n And how a porter’s Veneration \\n\\n \\n\\n Is hurt by porter’s occupation; \\n\\n \\n\\n Whether shillelaghs in reality \\n\\n \\n\\n May deaden Individuality; \\n\\n \\n\\n Or tongs and poker be creative \\n\\n \\n\\n Of alterations in th’ Amative; \\n\\n \\n\\n If falls from scaffolds make us less \\n\\n \\n\\n Inclined to all Constructiveness: \\n\\n \\n\\n With more such matters, all applying \\n\\n \\n\\n To heads — and therefore head-ifying. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1223/37882.html","bookId":111,"book":{"id":111,"title":"The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood","description":"简介： There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood.
