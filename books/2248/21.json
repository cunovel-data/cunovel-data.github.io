{"id":85641,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Chapter Twenty\n CAL HOPED FOR A WEEK, TWO IF HE COULD MANAGE it. And got three days. Nature screwed his plans again, this time shooting temperatures up into the fifties. Mountains of snow melted into hills while the February thaw brought the fun of flash flooding, swollen creeks, and black ice when the thermometer dropped to freezing each night.\n But three days after he\u0027d had his lane plowed and the women were back in the house on High Street, the weather stabilized. Creeks ran high, but the ground sucked up most of the runoff. And he was coming up short on excuses to put off the hike to the Pagan Stone.\n At his desk, with Lump contentedly sprawled on his back in the doorway, feet in the air, Cal put his mind into work. The winter leagues were winding up, and the spring groups would go into gear shortly. He knew he was on the edge of convincing his father the center would profit from the automatic scoring systems, and wanted to give it one more solid push. If they moved on it soon, they could have the systems up and running for the spring leagues.\n They\u0027d want to advertise, run a few specials. They\u0027d have to train the staff, which meant training themselves.\n He brought up the spreadsheet for February, noted that the month so far had been solid, even up a bit from last year. He\u0027d use that as more ammunition. Which, of course, his father could and would counter that if they were up the way things were, why change it?\n As he was holding the conversation in his head, Cal heard the click that meant a new e-mail had come in. He toggled over, saw Quinn\u0027s address.\n Hi, Love of My Life,\n I didn\u0027t want to call in case you were knee-deep in whatever requires you to be knee-deep. Let me know when you\u0027re not.\n Meanwhile, this is Black\u0027s Local Weather Service reporting: Temperatures today should reach a high of forty-eight under partly sunny skies. Lows in the upper thirties. No precipitation is expected. Tomorrow\u0027s forecast is for sunny with a high of fifty.\n Adding the visual, I can see widening patches of grass in both the front and backyard. Realistically, there\u0027s probably more snow, more mud in the woods, but, baby, it\u0027s time to saddle up and move out.\n My team can be ready bright and early tomorrow and will bring suitable provisions.\n Also, Cyb\u0027s confirmed the Clark branch connection, and is currently climbing out on some Kinski limbs to verify that. She thinks she may have a line on a couple of possibilities where Ann Hawkins stayed, or at least where she might have gone to give birth. I\u0027ll fill you in when I see you.\n Let me know, soon as you can, if tomorrow works.\n XXOO Quinn.\n (I know that whole XXOO thing is dopey, but it seemed more refined than signing off with: I wish you could come over and do me. Even though I do.)\n The last part made him smile even though the text of the post had a headache sneaking up the back of his skull.\n He could put her off a day or two, and put her off honestly. He couldn\u0027t expect Fox to dump his scheduled clients or any court appearances at the snap of a finger, and she\u0027d understand that. But if he were to use that, and his own schedule, he had to do it straight.\n With some annoyance, he shot an e-mail to Fox, asking when he could clear time for the trip to the clearing. The annoyance increased when Fox answered back immediately.\n Fri\u0027s good. Morning\u0027s clear, can clear full day if nec.\n \"Well, fuck.\" Cal pushed on the ache at the back of his head. Since e-mail wasn\u0027t bringing him any luck, he\u0027d go see Quinn in person when he broke for lunch.\n AS CAL PREPARED TO CLOSE OUT FOR THE MORNING, Bill Turner stopped in the office doorway.\n \"Ah, got that toilet fixed in the ladies\u0027 room downstairs, and the leak in the freezer was just a hose needed replacing.\"\n \"Thanks, Bill.\" He swung his coat on as he spoke. \"I\u0027ve got a couple of things to do in town. Shouldn\u0027t be above an hour.\"\n \"Okay, then. I was wondering if, ah...\" Bill rubbed a hand over his chin, let it drop. \"I was wondering if you think Gage\u0027ll be coming in, maybe the next day or two. Or if maybe I could, maybe I could run over to your place to have a word with him.\"\n Rock and a hard place, Cal thought, and bought himself some time by adjusting his jacket. \"I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s thinking about dropping by, Bill. He hasn\u0027t mentioned it. I think...Okay, look, I\u0027d give him some time. I\u0027d just give it some time before you made that first move. I know you want-\"\n \"It\u0027s okay. That\u0027s okay. Appreciate it.\"\n \"Shit,\" Cal said under his breath as Bill walked away. Then, \"Shit, shit, shit,\" as he headed out himself.\n He had to take Gage\u0027s side in this, how could he not? He\u0027d seen firsthand what Bill\u0027s belt had done to Gage when they\u0027d been kids. And yet, he\u0027d also witnessed, firsthand, the dozens of ways Bill had turned himself around in the last few years.\n And, hadn\u0027t he just seen the pain, guilt, even the grief on Bill\u0027s face just now? So either way he went, Cal knew he was going to feel guilty and annoyed.\n He walked straight out and over to Quinn\u0027s.\n She pulled open the door, yanked him in. Before he could say a word her arms were locked around his neck and her mouth was very busy on his. \"I was hoping that was you.\"\n \"Good thing it was, because Greg, the UPS guy on this route, might get the wrong idea if you greeted him that way.\"\n \"He is kind of cute. Come on back to the kitchen. I\u0027d just come down to do a coffee run. We\u0027re all working on various projects upstairs. Did you get my e-mail?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"So, we\u0027re all set for tomorrow?\" She glanced back as she reached up for the coffee.\n \"No, tomorrow\u0027s no good. Fox can\u0027t clear his slate until Friday.\"\n \"Oh.\" Her lips moved into a pout, quickly gone. \"Okay then, Friday it is. Meanwhile we\u0027ll keep reading, researching, working. Cyb thinks she\u0027s got a couple of good possibilities on...What?\" she asked when she got a good look at his face. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\n \"Okay.\" He took a couple paces away, then back. \"Okay, I\u0027m just going to say it. I don\u0027t want you going back in there. Just be quiet a minute, will you?\" he said when he saw the retort forming. \"I wish there was a way I could stop you from going, that there was a way I could ignore the fact that we all need to go. I know you\u0027re a part of this, and I know you have to go back to the Pagan Stone. I know there\u0027s going to be more you have to be a part of than I\u0027d wish otherwise. But I can wish you weren\u0027t part of this, Quinn, and that you were somewhere safe until this is over. I can want that, just as I know I can\u0027t have what I want.\n \"If you want to be pissed off about that, you\u0027ll have to be pissed off.\"\n She waited a beat. \"Have you had lunch?\"\n \"No. What does that have to do with anything?\"\n \"I\u0027m going to make you a sandwich-an offer I never make lightly.\"\n \"Why are you making it now?\"\n \"Because I love you. Take off your coat. I love that you\u0027d say all that to me,\" she began as she opened the refrigerator for fixings. \"That you\u0027d need to let me know how you felt about it. Now if you\u0027d tried ordering me to stay out of it, if you\u0027d lied or tried to do some sort of end-run around me, I\u0027d feel different. I\u0027d still love you, because that sort of thing sticks with me, but I\u0027d be mad, and more, I\u0027d be disappointed in you. As it is, Cal, I\u0027m finding myself pretty damn pleased and a hell of a lot smug that my head and heart worked so well together and picked the perfect guy. The perfect guy for me.\"\n She cut the sandwich into two tidy triangles, offered it. \"Do you want coffee or milk?\"\n \"You don\u0027t have milk, you have white water. Coffee\u0027d be fine, thanks.\" He took a bite of the turkey and Swiss with alfalfa on whole wheat. \"Pretty good sandwich.\"\n \"Don\u0027t get used to the service.\" She glanced over as she poured out coffee. \"We should get an early start on Friday, don\u0027t you think? Like dawn?\"\n \"Yeah.\" He touched her cheek with his free hand. \"We\u0027ll head in at first light.\"\n SINCE HE\u0027D HAD GOOD LUCK WITH QUINN, AND gotten lunch out of it, Cal decided he was going to speak his mind to Gage next. The minute he and Lump stepped into the house, he smelled food. And when they wandered back, Cal found Gage in the kitchen, taking a pull off a beer as he stirred something in a pot.\n \"You made food.\"\n \"Chili. I was hungry. Fox called. He tells me we\u0027re taking the ladies for a hike Friday.\"\n \"Yeah. First light.\"\n \"Should be interesting.\"\n \"Has to be done.\" Cal dumped out food for Lump before getting a beer of his own. And so, he thought, did this have to be done. \"I need to talk to you about your father.\"\n Cal saw Gage close off. Like a switch flipped, a finger snapped, his face simply blanked out. \"He works for you; that\u0027s your business. I\u0027ve got nothing to say.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got every right to shut him out. I\u0027m not saying different. I\u0027m letting you know he asks about you. He wants to see you. Look, he\u0027s been sober five years now, and if he\u0027d been sober fifty it wouldn\u0027t change the way he treated you. But this is a small town, Gage, and you can\u0027t dodge him forever. My sense is he\u0027s got things to say to you, and you may want to get it done, put it behind you. That\u0027s it.\"\n There was a reason Gage made his living at poker. It showed now in a face, a voice, completely devoid of expression. \"My sense is you should take yourself out of the middle. I haven\u0027t asked you to stand there.\"\n Cal held up a hand for peace. \"Fine.\"\n \"Sounds like the old man\u0027s stuck on Steps Eight and Nine with me. He can\u0027t make amends on this, Cal. I don\u0027t give a damn about his amends.\"\n \"Okay. I\u0027m not trying to convince you otherwise. Just letting you know.\"\n \"Now I know.\"\n IT OCCURRED TO CAL WHEN HE STOOD AT THE window on Friday morning, watching the headlights cut through the dim predawn, that it had been almost a month exactly since Quinn had first driven up to his house.\n How could so much have happened? How could so much have changed in such a short time?\n It had been slightly less than that month since he\u0027d led her into the woods the first time. When he\u0027d led her to the Pagan Stone.\n In those short weeks of the shortest month he\u0027d learned it wasn\u0027t only himself and his two blood brothers who were destined to face this threat. There were three women now, equally involved.\n And he was completely in love with one of them.\n He stood just as he was to watch her climb out of Fox\u0027s truck. Her bright hair spilled out from under the dark watch cap. She wore a bold red jacket and scarred hiking boots. He could see the laugh on her face as she said something to Cybil, and her breath whisked out in clouds in the early morning chill.\n She knew enough to be afraid, he understood that. But she refused to allow fear to dictate her moves. He hoped he could say the same as he had more to risk now. He had her.\n He stood watch until he heard Fox use his key to unlock the front door, then Cal went down to join them, and to gather his things for the day.\n Fog smoked the ground that the cold had hardened like stone overnight. By midday, Cal knew the path would be sloppy again, but for now it was quick and easy going.\n There were still pockets and lumpy hills of snow, and he identified the hoofprints of the deer that roamed the woods, to Layla\u0027s delight. If any of them were nervous, they hid it well, at least on this first leg of the hike.\n It was so different from that long-ago day in July when he and Fox and Gage had made this trip. No boom box pumping out rap or heavy metal, no snacks of Little Debbies, no innocent, youthful excitement of a stolen day, and the night to come.\n None of them had ever been so innocent again.\n He caught himself lifting a hand to his face, where his glasses used to slide down the bridge of his nose.\n \"How you doing, Captain?\" Quinn stepped up to match her pace to his, gave him a light arm bump.\n \"Okay. I was just thinking about that day. Everything hot and green, Fox hauling that stupid boom box. My mother\u0027s lemonade, snack cakes.\"\n \"Sweat rolling,\" Fox continued from just behind him.\n \"We\u0027re coming up on Hester\u0027s Pool,\" Gage said, breaking the memory.\n The water made Cal think of quicksand rather than the cool and forbidden pool he and his friends had leaped into so long ago. He could imagine going in now, being sucked in, deeper and deeper until he never saw light again.\n They stopped as they had before, but now it was coffee instead of lemonade.\n \"There\u0027s been deer here, too.\" Layla pointed at the ground. \"Those are deer prints, right?\"\n \"Some deer,\" Fox confirmed. \"Raccoon.\" He took her arm to turn her, pointed to the prints on the ground.\n \"Raccoons?\" Grinning, she bent to take a closer look. \"What else might be in here?\"\n \"Some of my namesakes, wild turkey, now and then-though mostly north of here-you might see bear.\"\n She straightened quickly. \"Bear.\"\n \"Mostly north,\" he repeated, but found it as good an excuse as any to take her hand.\n Cybil crouched by the edge of the pool, stared at the water.\n \"A little cold to think about taking a dip,\" Gage told her.\n \"Hester drowned herself here.\" She glanced up, then looked over at Cal. \"And when you went in that day, you saw her.\"\n \"Yeah. Yeah, I saw her.\"\n \"And you and Quinn have both seen her in your heads. Layla\u0027s dreamed of her, vividly. So...maybe I can get something.\"\n \"I thought yours was precog, not the past,\" Cal began.\n \"It is, but I still get vibes from people, from places that are strong enough to send them out. How about you?\" She looked back at Gage. \"We might stir up more in tandem. Are you up for that?\"\n Saying nothing, he held out a hand. She took it, rose to her feet. Together, they stared at that still, brown surface.\n The water began to beat and froth. It began to spin, to spew up white-tipped waves. It roared like a sea mating with a wild and vicious storm.\n And a hand shot out to claw at the ground.\n Hester pulled herself out of that churning water-bone white skin, a mass of wet, tangled hair, dark, glassy eyes. The effort, or her madness, peeled her lips back from her teeth.\n Cybil heard herself scream as Hester Deale\u0027s arms opened, as they locked around her and dragged her toward that swirling brown pool.\n \"Cyb! Cyb! Cybil!\"\n She came back struggling, and found herself locked not in Hester\u0027s arms, but Gage\u0027s. \"What the hell was that?\"\n \"You were going in.\"\n She stayed where she was, feeling her heart hammer against his as Quinn gripped her shoulder. Cybil took another look at the still surface of the pool. \"That would\u0027ve been really unpleasant.\"\n She was trembling, one hard jolt after the next, but Gage had to give her points for keeping her voice even.\n \"Did you get anything?\" she asked him.\n \"Water kicked up; she came up. You started to tip.\"\n \"She grabbed me. She...embraced me. That\u0027s what I think, but I wasn\u0027t focused enough to feel or sense what she felt. Maybe if we tried it again-\"\n \"We\u0027ve got to get moving now,\" Cal interrupted.\n \"It only took a minute.\"\n \"Try nearly fifteen,\" Fox corrected.\n \"But...\" Cybil eased back from Gage when she realized she was still in his arms. \"Did it seem that long to you?\"\n \"No. It was immediate.\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t.\" Layla held out another thermos lid of coffee. \"We were arguing about whether we should pull you back, and how we should if we did. Quinn said to leave you be for another few minutes, that sometimes it took you a while to warm up.\"\n \"Well, it felt like a minute, no more than, for the whole deal. And it didn\u0027t feel like something from before.\" Again, Cybil looked at Gage.\n \"No, it didn\u0027t. So if I were you, I wouldn\u0027t think about taking a dip anytime soon.\"\n \"I prefer a nice blue pool, with a swim-up bar.\"\n \"Bikini margaritas.\" Quinn rubbed her hand up and down Cybil\u0027s arm.\n \"Spring break, two thousand.\" Cybil caught Quinn\u0027s hand, squeezed. \"I\u0027m fine, Q.\"\n \"I\u0027ll buy the first round of those margaritas when this is done. Ready to move on?\" Cal asked.\n He hitched up his pack, turned. Then shook his head. \"This isn\u0027t right.\"\n \"We\u0027re leaving the haunted pool to walk through the demonic woods.\" Quinn worked up a smile. \"What could be wrong?\"\n \"That\u0027s not the path.\" He gestured toward the thawing track. \"That\u0027s not the direction.\" He squinted up at the sun as he pulled his old Boy Scout compass out of his pocket.\n \"Ever thought about upgrading to a GPS?\" Gage asked him.\n \"This does the job. See, we need to head west from here. That trail\u0027s leading north. That trail shouldn\u0027t even be there.\"\n \"It\u0027s not there.\" Fox\u0027s eyes narrowed, darkened. \"There\u0027s no trail, just underbrush, a thicket of wild blackberries. It\u0027s not real.\" He shifted, angled himself. \"It\u0027s that way.\" He gestured west. \"It\u0027s hard to see, it\u0027s like looking through mud, but...\"\n Layla stepped forward, took his hand.\n \"Okay, yeah. That\u0027s better.\"\n \"You\u0027re pointing at a really big-ass tree,\" Cybil told him.\n \"That isn\u0027t there.\" Still holding Layla\u0027s hand, Fox walked forward. The image of the large oak broke apart as he walked through it.\n \"Nice trick.\" Quinn let out a breath. \"So, Twisse doesn\u0027t want us to go to the clearing. I\u0027ll take point.\"\n \"I\u0027ll take point.\" Cal took her arm to tug her behind him. \"I\u0027ve got the compass.\" He had only to glance back at his friends to have them falling in line. Fox taking center, Gage the rear with the women between.\n As soon as the track widened enough to allow it, Quinn moved up beside Cal. \"This is the way it has to work.\" She glanced back to see the other women had followed her lead, and now walked abreast with their partners. \"We\u0027re linked up this way, Cal. Two-by-two, trios, the group of six. Whatever the reasons are, that\u0027s the way it is.\"\n \"We\u0027re walking into something. I can\u0027t see what it is, but I\u0027m walking you and the others right into it.\"\n \"We\u0027re all on our own two feet, Cal.\" She passed him the bottle of water she carried in her coat pocket. \"I don\u0027t know if I love you because you\u0027re Mr. Responsibility or in spite of it.\"\n \"As long as you do. And since you do, maybe we should think about the idea of getting married.\"\n \"I like the idea,\" she said after a moment. \"If you want my thoughts on it.\"\n \"I do.\" Stupid, he thought, stupid way to propose, and a ridiculous place for it, too. Then again, when they couldn\u0027t be sure what was around the bend, it made sense to grab what you did now, tight and quick. \"As it happens, I agree with you. More thoughts on the idea would be that my mother, especially, will want the splash-big deal, big party, bells and whistles.\"\n \"I happen to agree with that, too. How is she with communication by phone and/or e-mail?\"\n \"She\u0027s all about that.\"\n \"Great. I\u0027ll hook her up with my mother and they can go for it. How\u0027s your September schedule?\"\n \"September?\"\n She studied the winter woods, watched a squirrel scamper up a tree and across a thick branch. \"I bet the Hollow\u0027s beautiful in September. Still green, but with just a hint of the color to come.\"\n \"I was thinking sooner. Like April, or May.\" Before, Cal thought. Before July, and what might be the end of everything he knew and loved.\n \"It takes a while to organize those bells and whistles.\" When she looked at him he understood she read him clearly. \"After, Cal, after we\u0027ve won. One more thing to celebrate. When we\u0027re-\"\n She broke off when he touched a finger to her lips.\n The sound came clearly now as all movement and conversation stopped. The wet and throaty snarl rolled across the air, and shot cold down the spine. Lump curled down on his haunches and whined.\n \"He hears it, too, this time.\" Cal shifted, and though the movement was slight, it put Quinn between him and Fox.\n \"I don\u0027t guess we could be lucky, and that\u0027s just a bear.\" Layla cleared her throat. \"Either way, I think we should keep moving. Whatever it is doesn\u0027t want us to, so...\"\n \"We\u0027re here to flip it the bird,\" Fox finished.\n \"Come on, Lump, come on with me.\"\n The dog shivered at Cal\u0027s command, but rose, and with its side pressed to Cal\u0027s legs, walked down the trail toward the Pagan Stone.\n The wolf-Cal would never have referred to the thing as a dog-stood at the mouth of the clearing. It was huge and black, with eyes that were somehow human. Lump tried a halfhearted snarl in answer to the low, warning growl, then cowered against Cal.\n \"Are we going to walk through that, too?\" Gage asked from the rear.\n \"It\u0027s not like the false trail.\" Fox shook his head. \"It\u0027s not real, but it\u0027s there.\"\n \"Okay.\" Gage started to pull off his pack.\n And the thing leaped.\n It seemed to fly, Cal thought, a mass of muscle and teeth. He fisted his hands to defend, but there was nothing to fight.\n \"I felt...\" Slowly, Quinn lowered the arms she\u0027d thrown up to protect her face.\n \"Yeah. Not just the cold, not that time.\" Cal gripped her arm to keep her close. \"There was weight, just for a second, and there was substance.\"\n \"We never had that before, not even during the Seven.\" Fox scanned the woods on both sides. \"Whatever form Twisse took, whatever we saw, it wasn\u0027t really there. It\u0027s always been mind games.\"\n \"If it can solidify, it can hurt us directly,\" Layla pointed out.\n \"And be hurt.\" From behind her Gage pulled a 9mm Glock out of his pack.\n \"Good thinking,\" was Cybil\u0027s cool opinion.\n \"Jesus Christ, Gage, where the hell did you get that?\"\n Gage lifted his eyebrows at Fox. \"Guy I know down in D.C. Are we going to stand here in a huddle, or are we going in?\"\n \"Don\u0027t point that at anybody,\" Fox demanded.\n \"Safety\u0027s on.\"\n \"That\u0027s what they always say before they accidentally blow a hole in the best friend.\"\n They stepped into the clearing, and the stone.\n \"My God, it\u0027s beautiful.\" Cybil breathed the words reverently as she moved toward it. \"It can\u0027t possibly be a natural formation, it\u0027s too perfect. It\u0027s designed, and for worship, I\u0027d think. And it\u0027s warm. Feel it. The stone\u0027s warm.\" She circled it. \"Anyone with any sensitivity has to feel, has to know this is sacred ground.\"\n \"Sacred to who?\" Gage countered. \"Because what came up out of here twenty-one years ago wasn\u0027t all bright and friendly.\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t all dark either. We felt both.\" Cal looked at Fox. \"We saw both.\"\n \"Yeah. It\u0027s just the big, black scary mass got most of our attention while we were being blasted off our feet.\"\n \"But the other gave us most of his, that\u0027s what I think. I walked out of here not only without a scratch, but with twenty-twenty vision and a hell of an immune system.\"\n \"The scratches on my arms had healed up, and the bruises from my most recent tussle with Napper.\" Fox shrugged. \"Never been sick a day since.\"\n \"How about you?\" Cybil asked Gage. \"Any miraculous healing?\"\n \"None of us had a mark on him after the blast,\" Cal began.\n \"It\u0027s no deal, Cal. No secrets from the team. My old man used his belt on me the night before we were heading in here. A habit of his when he\u0027d get a drunk on. I was carrying the welts when I came in, but not when I walked out.\"\n \"I see.\" Cybil held Gage\u0027s eyes for several beats. \"The fact that you were given protection, and your specific abilities, enabled you to defend your ground, so to speak. Otherwise, you\u0027d have been three helpless little boys.\"\n \"It\u0027s clean.\" Layla\u0027s comment had everyone turning to where she stood by the stone. \"That\u0027s what comes to my mind. I don\u0027t think it was ever used for sacrifice. Not blood and death, not for the dark. It feels clean.\"\n \"I\u0027ve seen the blood on it,\" Gage said. \"I\u0027ve seen it burn. I\u0027ve heard the screams.\"\n \"That\u0027s not its purpose. Maybe that\u0027s what Twisse wants.\" Quinn laid her palm on the stone. \"To defile it, to twist its power. If he can, well, he\u0027ll own it, won\u0027t he? Cal?\"\n \"Okay.\" His hand hovered over hers. \"Ready?\" At her nod, he joined his hand to hers on the stone.\n At first there was only her, only Quinn. Only the courage in her eyes. Then the world tumbled back, five years, twenty, so that he saw the boy he\u0027d been with his friends, scoring his knife over their wrists to bind them together. Then rushing back, decades, centuries, to the blaze and the screams while the stone stood cool and white in the midst of hell.\n Back to another waning winter where Giles Dent stood with Ann Hawkins as he stood with Quinn now. Dent\u0027s words came from his lips.\n \"We have only until summer. This I cannot change, even for you. Duty outstrips even my love for you, and for the lives we have made.\" He touched a hand to her belly. \"I wish, above all, that I could be with you when they come into the world.\"\n \"Let me stay. Beloved.\"\n \"I am the guardian. You are the hope. I cannot destroy the beast, only chain it for a time. Still, I do not leave you. It is not death, but an endless struggle, a war only I can wage. Until what comes from us makes the end. They will have all I can give, this I swear to you. If they are victorious in their time, I will be with you again.\"\n \"What will I tell them of their father?\"\n \"That he loved their mother, and them, with the whole of his heart.\"\n \"Giles, it has a man\u0027s form. A man can bleed, a man can die.\"\n \"It is not a man, and it is not in my power to destroy it. That will be for those who come after us both. It, too, will make its own. Not through love. They will not be what it intends. It cannot own them if they are beyond its reach, even its ken. This is for me to do. I am not the first, Ann, only the last. What comes from us is the future.\"\n She pressed a hand to her side. \"They quicken,\" she whispered. \"When, Giles, when will it end? All the lives we have lived before, all the joy and the pain we have known? When will there be peace for us?\"\n \"Be my heart.\" He lifted her hands to his lips. \"I will be your courage. And we will find each other once more.\"\n Tears slid down Quinn\u0027s cheeks even as she felt the images fade. \"We\u0027re all they have. If we don\u0027t find the way, they\u0027re lost to each other. I felt her heart breaking inside me.\"\n \"He believed in what he\u0027d done, what he had to do. He believed in us, though he couldn\u0027t see it clearly. I don\u0027t think he could see us, all of us,\" Cal said as he looked around. \"Not clearly. He took it on faith.\"\n \"Fine for him.\" Gage shifted his weight. \"But I put a little more of mine in this Glock.\"\n It wasn\u0027t the wolf, but the boy that stood on the edge of the clearing. Grinning, grinning. He lifted his hands, showed fingernails that were sharpened to claws.\n The sun dimmed from midday to twilight; the air from cool to frigid. And thunder rumbled in the late winter sky.\n In a lightning move so unexpected Cal couldn\u0027t prevent it, Lump sprang. The thing who masked as a boy squealed with laughter, shinnied up a tree like a monkey.\n But Cal had seen it, in a flash of an instant. He\u0027d seen the shock, and what might have been fear.\n \"Shoot it,\" Cal shouted to Gage, even as he dashed forward to grab Lump\u0027s collar. \"Shoot the son of a bitch.\"\n \"Jesus, you don\u0027t actually think a bullet\u0027s going to-\"\n Over Fox\u0027s objection, Gage fired. Without hesitation, he aimed for the boy\u0027s heart.\n The bullet cracked the air, struck the tree. This time no one could miss the look of shock on the boy\u0027s face. His howl of pain and fury gushed across the clearing and shook the ground.\n With ruthless purpose, Gage emptied the clip into it.\n It changed. It grew. It twisted itself into something massive and black and sinuous that rose over Cal as he stood his ground, fighting to hold back his dog, who strained and barked like a mad thing.\n The stench of it, the cold of it hammered down on him like stones. \"We\u0027re still here,\" Cal shouted. \"This is our place, and you can go to hell.\"\n He staggered against a blast of sound and slapping air.\n \"Better reload, Deadeye,\" Cybil commanded.\n \"Knew I should\u0027ve bought a howitzer.\" But Gage slapped in a full clip.\n \"This isn\u0027t your place,\" Cal shouted again. The wind threatened to knock him off his feet, seemed to tear at his clothes and his skin like a thousand knives. Through the scream of it, he heard the crack of gunfire, and the rage it spewed out clamped on his throat like claws.\n Then Quinn braced against his side. And Fox shouldered in at his other. They formed a line, all six.\n \"This,\" Cal called out, \"is ours. Our place and our time. You couldn\u0027t have my dog, and you can\u0027t have my town.\"\n \"So fuck off,\" Fox suggested, and bending picked up a rock. He hurled it, a straightaway fast ball.\n \"Hello, got a gun here.\"\n Fox\u0027s grin at Gage was wild and wide as the feral wind battered them. \"Throwing rocks is an insult. It\u0027ll undermine its confidence.\"\n Die here!\n It wasn\u0027t a voice, but a tidal wave of sound and wind that knocked them to the ground, scattered them like bowling pins.\n \"Undermine, my ass.\" Gage shoved to his knees and began firing again.\n \"You\u0027ll die here.\" Cal spoke coolly as the others took Fox\u0027s tack and began to hurl stones and sticks.\n Fire swept across the clearing, its flames like shards of ice. Smoke belched up in fetid clouds as it roared its outrage.\n \"You\u0027ll die here,\" Cal repeated. Pulling his knife from its sheath, he rushed foward to plunge it into the boiling black mass.\n It screamed. He thought it screamed, thought the sound held something of pain as well as fury. The shock of power sang up his arm, stabbed through him like a blade, twin edges of scorching heat and impossible cold. It flung him away, sent him flying through the smoke like a pebble from a sling. Breathless, bones jarred from the fall, Cal scrambled to his feet.\n \"You\u0027ll die here!\" This time he shouted it as he gripped the knife, as he charged forward.\n The thing that was a wolf, a boy, a man, a demon looked at him with eyes of hate.\n And vanished.\n \"But not today.\" The fire died, the smoke cleared as he bent over to suck in air. \"Anybody hurt? Is everybody okay? Quinn. Hey, Lump, hey.\" He nearly toppled backward when Lump leaped up, paws on shoulders to lap his face.\n \"Your nose is bleeding.\" Scurrying over on her hands and knees, Quinn gripped his arm to pull herself to her feet. \"Cal.\" Her hands rushed over his face, his body. \"Oh God, Cal. I\u0027ve never seen anything so brave, or so goddamn stupid.\"\n \"Yeah, well.\" In a defiant move, he swiped at the blood. \"It pissed me off. If that was its best shot, it fell way short.\"\n \"It didn\u0027t dish out anything a really big drink and a long hot bath won\u0027t cure,\" Cybil decided. \"Layla? Okay?\"\n \"Okay.\" Face fierce, Layla brushed at her stinging cheeks. \"Okay.\" She took Fox\u0027s outstretched hand and got to her feet. \"We scared it. We scared it, and it ran away.\"\n \"Even better. We hurt it.\" Quinn took a couple shuddering breaths, then much as Lump had, leaped at Cal. \"We\u0027re all right. We\u0027re all okay. You were amazing. You were beyond belief. Oh God, God, give me a really big kiss.\"\n As she laughed and wept, he took her mouth. He held her close, understanding that of all the answers they needed, for him she was the first.\n They weren\u0027t going down this time, he realized.\n \"We\u0027re going to win this.\" He drew her away so he could look into her eyes. His were calm, steady, and clear. \"I never believed it before, not really. But I do now. I know it now. Quinn.\" He pressed his lips to her forehead. \"We\u0027re going to win this, and we\u0027re getting married in September.\"\n \"Damn straight.\"\n When she wrapped around him again, it was victory enough for now. It was enough to stand on until the next time. And the next time, he determined, they\u0027d be better armed.\n \"Let\u0027s go home. It\u0027s a long walk back, and we\u0027ve got a hell of a lot to do.\"\n She held on another moment, held tight while he looked over her head into the eyes of his brothers. Gage nodded, then shoved the gun back in his pack. Swinging it on, he crossed the clearing to the path beyond.\n The sun bloomed overhead, and the wind died. They walked out of the clearing, through the winter woods, three men, three women, and a dog.\n On its ground the Pagan Stone stood silent, waiting for their return.\n Hawkins Hollow\n June 1994\n ON A BRIGHT SUMMER MORNING, A TEACUP poodle drowned in the Bestlers\u0027 backyard swimming pool. At first, Lynne Bestler, who\u0027d gone out to sneak in a solitary swim before her kids woke, thought it was a dead squirrel. Which would\u0027ve been bad enough. But when she steeled herself to scoop out the tangle of fur with the net, she recognized her neighbor\u0027s beloved Marcell.\n Squirrels generally didn\u0027t wear rhinestone collars.\n Her shouts, and the splash as Lynne tossed the hapless dog, net and all, back into the pool, brought Lynne\u0027s husband rushing out in his boxers. Their mother\u0027s sobs and their father\u0027s curses as he jumped in to grab the pole and tow the body to the side, woke the Bestler twins, who stood screaming in their matching My Little Pony nightgowns. Within moments, the backyard hysteria had neighbors hurrying to fences just as Bestler dragged himself and his burden out of the water. As, like many men, Bestler had developed an attachment to ancient underwear, the weight of the water was too much for the worn elastic.\n So Bestler came out of his pool with a dead dog, and no boxers.\n The bright summer morning in the little town of Hawkins Hollow began with shock, grief, farce, and drama.\n Fox learned of Marcell\u0027s untimely death minutes after he stepped into Ma\u0027s Pantry to pick up a sixteen-ounce bottle of Coke and a couple of Slim Jims.\n He\u0027d copped a quick break from working with his father on a kitchen remodel down Main Street. Mrs. Larson wanted new countertops, cabinet doors, new floors, new paint. She called it freshening things up, and Fox called it a way to earn enough money to take Allyson Brendon out for pizza and the movies on Saturday night. He hoped to use that gateway to talk her into the backseat of his ancient VW Bug.\n He didn\u0027t mind working with his dad. He hoped to hell he wouldn\u0027t spend the rest of his life swinging a hammer or running a power saw, but he didn\u0027t mind it. His father\u0027s company was always easy, and the job got Fox out of gardening and animal duty on their little farm. It also provided easy access to Cokes and Slim Jims-two items which would never, never be found in the O\u0027Dell-Barry household.\n His mother ruled there.\n So he heard about the dog from Susan Keefaffer, who rang up his purchases while a few people with nothing better to do on a June afternoon sat at the counter over coffee and gossip.\n He didn\u0027t know Marcell, but Fox had a soft spot for animals, so he suffered a twist of grief for the unfortunate poodle. That was leavened somewhat by the idea of Mr. Bestler, whom he did know, standing \"naked as a jaybird,\" in Susan Keefaffer\u0027s words, beside his backyard pool.\n While it made Fox sad to imagine some poor dog drowning in a swimming pool, he didn\u0027t connect it-not then-to the nightmare he and his two closest friends had lived through seven years before.\n He\u0027d had a dream the night before, a dream of blood and fire, of voices chanting in a language he didn\u0027t understand. But then he\u0027d watched a double feature of videos-The Night of the Living Dead and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-with his friends Cal and Gage.\n He didn\u0027t connect a dead French poodle with the dream, or with what had burned through Hawkins Hollow for a week after his tenth birthday. After the night he and Cal and Gage had spent at the Pagan Stone in Hawkins Wood-and everything had changed for them, and for the Hollow.\n In a few weeks he and Cal and Gage would all turn seventeen-and that was on his mind. Baltimore had a damn good chance at a pennant this year, so that was on his mind. He\u0027d be going back to high school as a senior, which meant top of the food chain at last, and planning for college.\n What occupied a sixteen-year-old boy was considerably different than what occupied a ten-year-old. Including rounding third and heading for home with Allyson Brendon.\n So when he walked back down the street, a lean boy not quite beyond the gangly stage of adolescence, his dense brown hair tied back in a stubby tail, golden brown eyes shaded with Oakleys, it was, for him, just another ordinary day.\n The town looked as it always did. Tidy, a little old-timey, with the old stone townhouses or shops, the painted porches, the high curbs. He glanced back over his shoulder toward the Bowl-a-Rama on the square. It was the biggest building in town, and where Cal and Gage were both working.\n When he and his father knocked off for the day, he thought, he\u0027d head on up, see what was happening.\n He crossed over to the Larson place, walked into the unlocked house where Bonnie Raitt\u0027s smooth Delta blues slid smoothly out of the kitchen. His father sang along with her in his clear and easy voice as he checked the level on the shelves Mrs. Larson wanted in her utility closet. Though the windows and back door were open to their screens, the room smelled of sawdust, sweat, and the glue they\u0027d used that morning to lay the new Formica.\n His father worked in old Levi\u0027s and his Give Peace a Chance T-shirt. His hair was six inches longer than Fox\u0027s, worn in a tail under a blue bandanna. He\u0027d shaved off the beard and mustache he\u0027d had as long as Fox remembered. Fox still wasn\u0027t quite used to seeing so much of his father\u0027s face-or so much of himself in it.\n \"A dog drowned in the Bestlers\u0027 swimming pool over on Laurel Lane,\" Fox told him, and Brian stopped working to turn.\n \"That\u0027s a damn shame. Anybody know how it happened?\"\n \"Not really. It was one of those little poodles, so think it must\u0027ve fallen in, then it couldn\u0027t get out again.\"\n \"You\u0027d think somebody would\u0027ve heard it barking. That\u0027s a lousy way to go.\" Brian set down his tools, smiled at his boy. \"Gimme one of those Slim Jims.\"\n \"What Slim Jims?\"\n \"The ones you\u0027ve got in your back pocket. You\u0027re not carrying a bag, and you weren\u0027t gone long enough to scarf down Hostess Pies or Twinkies. I\u0027m betting you\u0027re packing the Jims. I get one, and your mom never has to know we ate chemicals and meat by-products. It\u0027s called blackmail, kid of mine.\"\n Fox snorted, pulled them out. He\u0027d bought two for just this purpose. Father and son unwrapped, bit off, chewed in perfect harmony. \"The counter looks good, Dad.\"\n \"Yeah, it does.\" Brian ran a hand over the smooth, eggshell surface. \"Mrs. Larson\u0027s not much for color, but it\u0027s good work. I don\u0027t know who I\u0027m going to get to be my lapdog when you head off to college.\"\n \"Ridge is next in line,\" Fox said, thinking of his younger brother. \"Ridge wouldn\u0027t keep measurements in his head for two minutes running, and he\u0027d probably cut off a finger dreaming while he was using a band saw. No.\" Brian smiled, shrugged. \"This kind of work isn\u0027t for Ridge, or for you, for that matter. Or either of your sisters. I guess I\u0027m going to have to rent a kid to get one who wants to work with wood.\"\n \"I never said I didn\u0027t want to.\" Not out loud.\n His father looked at him the way he sometimes did, as if he saw more than what was there. \"You\u0027ve got a good eye, you\u0027ve got good hands. You\u0027ll be handy around your own house once you get one. But you won\u0027t be strapping on a tool belt to make a living. Until you figure out just what it is you want, you can haul these scraps on out to the Dumpster.\"\n \"Sure.\" Fox gathered up scraps, trash, began to cart them out the back, across the narrow yard to the Dumpster the Larsons had rented for the duration of the remodel.\n He glanced toward the adjoining yard and the sound of kids playing. And the armload he carried thumped and bounced on the ground as his body went numb.\n The little boys played with trucks and shovels and pails in a bright blue sandbox. But it wasn\u0027t filled with sand. Blood covered their bare arms as they pushed their Tonka trucks through the muck inside the box. He stumbled back as the boys made engine sounds, as red lapped over the bright blue sides and dripped onto the green grass.\n On the fence between the yards, where hydrangeas headed up toward bloom, crouched a boy that wasn\u0027t a boy. He bared its teeth in a grin as Fox backed toward the house.\n \"Dad! Dad!\"\n The tone, the breathless fear had Brian rushing outside. \"What? What is it?\"\n \"Don\u0027t you-can\u0027t you see?\" But even as he said it, as he pointed, something inside Fox knew. It wasn\u0027t real.\n \"What?\" Firmly now, Brian took his son\u0027s shoulders. \"What do you see?\"\n The boy that wasn\u0027t a boy danced along the top of the chain-link fence while flames spurted up below and burned the hydrangeas to cinders.\n \"I have to go. I have to go see Cal and Gage. Right now, Dad. I have to-\"\n \"Go.\" Brian released his hold on Fox, stepped back. He didn\u0027t question. \"Go.\"\n He all but flew through the house and out again, up the sidewalk to the square. The town no longer looked as it usubeen that horrible week in July seven years before.\n Fire and blood, he remembered, thinking of the dream. He burst into the Bowl-a-Rama, where the summer afternoon leagues were in full swing. The thunder of balls, the crash of pins pounded in his head as he ran straight to the front desk where Cal worked.\n \"Where\u0027s Gage?\" Fox demanded.\n \"Jesus, what\u0027s up with you?\"\n \"Where\u0027s Gage?\" Fox repeated, and Cal \u0027s amused gray eyes sobered. \"Working the arcade. He\u0027s...he\u0027s coming out now.\"\n At Cal \u0027s quick signal, Gage sauntered over. \"Hello, ladies. What...\" The smirk died after one look at Fox\u0027s face. \"What happened?\"\n \"It\u0027s back,\" Fox said. \"It\u0027s come back.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-brothers-sign-of-seven-1/page-21.html","bookId":2248,"book":{"id":2248,"title":"Blood Brothers (Sign of Seven #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood Brothers (Sign of Seven #1) \n Every seven years, there comes a week in July when the locals do unspeakable things--and then don\u0027t seem to remember them.
