{"id":85640,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Chapter Nineteen\\n\\n IN THE DINING ROOM, QUINN SET COPIES OF THE printouts in front of everyone. There were bowls of popcorn on the table, she noted, a bottle of wine, glasses, and paper towels folded into triangles. Which would all be Cybil\u0027s doing, she knew.\\n\\n Just as she knew Cybil had made the popcorn for her. Not a peace offering; they didn\u0027t need peace offerings between them. It was just because.\\n\\n She touched a hand to Cybil\u0027s shoulder before she took her seat.\\n\\n \"Apologies for big drama,\" Quinn began.\\n\\n \"If you think that was drama, you need to come over to my parents\u0027 house during one of the family gatherings.\" Fox gave her a smile as he took a handful of popcorn. \"The Barry-O\u0027Dells don\u0027t need demon blood to raise hell.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll all accept the demon thing is going to be a running gag from now on.\" Quinn poured a glass of wine. \"I don\u0027t know how much all this will tell everyone, but it\u0027s more than we had before. It shows a direct line from the other side.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure Twisse is the one who raped Hester Deale?\" Gage asked. \"Certain he\u0027s the one who knocked her up?\"\\n\\n Quinn nodded. \"Believe me.\"\\n\\n \"I experienced it.\" Layla twisted the paper towel in her hands as she spoke. \"It wasn\u0027t like the flashes Cal and Quinn get, but...Maybe the blood tie explains it. I don\u0027t know. But I know what he did to her. And I know she was a virgin before he-it-raped her.\"\\n\\n Gently, Fox took the pieces of the paper towel she\u0027d torn, gave her his.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Gage continued, \"are we sure Twisse is what we\u0027re calling the demon for lack of better?\"\\n\\n \"He never liked that term,\" Cal put in. \"I think we can go affirmative on that.\"\\n\\n \"So, Twisse uses Hester to sire a child, to extend his line. If he\u0027s been around as long as we think-going off some of the stuff Cal\u0027s seen and related, it\u0027s likely he\u0027d done the same before.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" Cybil acknowledged. \"Maybe that\u0027s where we get people like Hitler or Osama bin Laden, Jack the Ripper, child abusers, serial killers.\"\\n\\n \"If you look at the lineage, you\u0027ll see there were a lot of suicides and violent deaths, especially in the first hundred, hundred and twenty years after Hester. I think,\" Quinn said slowly, \"if we\u0027re able to dig a little deeper on individuals, we might find more than the average family share of murder, insanity.\"\\n\\n \"Anything that stands out in recent memory?\" Fox asked. \"Major family skeletons?\"\\n\\n \"Not that I know of. I have the usual share of kooky or annoying relatives, but nobody\u0027s been incarcerated or institutionalized.\"\\n\\n \"It dilutes.\" Fox narrowed his eyes as he paged through the printouts. \"This wasn\u0027t his plan, wasn\u0027t his strategy. I know strategy. Consider. Twisse doesn\u0027t know what Dent\u0027s got cooking that night. He\u0027s got Hester-got her mind under control, got the demon bun in the oven, but he doesn\u0027t know that\u0027s going to be it.\"\\n\\n \"That Dent\u0027s ready for him, and has his own plans,\" Layla continued. \"I see where you\u0027re going. He thought-planned-to destroy Dent that night, or at least damage him, drive him away.\"\\n\\n \"Then he gets the town,\" Fox continued, \"uses it up, moves on. Leaves progeny, before he finds the next spot that suits him to do the same.\"\\n\\n \"Instead Dent takes him down, holds him down until...\" Cal turned over his hand, exposed the thin scar on his wrist. \"Until Dent\u0027s progeny let him out. Why would he want that? Why would he allow it?\"\\n\\n \"Could be Dent figured keeping a demon in a headlock for three centuries was long enough.\" Gage helped himself to popcorn. \"Or that\u0027s as long as he could hold him, and he called out some reinforcements.\"\\n\\n \"Ten-year-old boys,\" Cal said in disgust.\\n\\n \"Children are more likely to believe, to accept what adults can\u0027t. Or won\u0027t,\" Cybil added. \"And hell, nobody said any of this was fair. He gave you what he could. Your ability to heal quickly, your insights into what was, is, will be. He gave you the stone, in three parts.\"\\n\\n \"And time to grow up,\" Layla added. \"Twenty-one years. Maybe he found the way to bring us here. Quinn, Cybil, and me. Because I can\u0027t see the logic, the purpose of having me compelled to come here, then trying to scare me away.\"\\n\\n \"Good point.\" And it loosened something inside Quinn\u0027s belly. \"That\u0027s a damn good point. Why scare if he could seduce? Really good point.\"\\n\\n \"I can look deeper into the family tree for you, Q. And I\u0027ll see what I can find on Layla\u0027s and my own. But that\u0027s just busywork at this point. We know the root.\"\\n\\n Cybil turned one of the pages over, used a pencil on the back. She drew two horizontal lines at the bottom. \"Giles Dent and Ann Hawkins here, Lazarus Twisse and the doomed Hester here. Each root sends up a tree, and the trees their branches.\" She drew quickly, simply. \"And at the right point, branches from each tree cross each other. In palmistry the crossing of lines is a sign of power.\"\\n\\n She completed the sketch, three branches, crossing three branches. \"So we have to find the power, and use it.\"\\n\\n T HAT EVENING, LAYLA DID SOMETHING FAIRLY tasty with chicken breasts, stewed tomatoes, and white beans. By mutual agreement they channeled the conversation into other areas. Normal, Quinn thought as it ranged from dissecting recent movies to bad jokes to travel. They all needed a good dose of normal.\\n\\n \"Gage is the one with itchy feet,\" Cal commented. \"He\u0027s been traveling that long, lonesome highway since he hit eighteen.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not always lonesome.\"\\n\\n \"Cal said you were in Prague.\" Quinn considered. \"I think I\u0027d like to see Prague.\"\\n\\n \"I thought it was Budapest.\"\\n\\n Gage glanced at Cybil. \"There, too. Prague was the last stop before heading back.\"\\n\\n \"Is it fabulous?\" Layla wondered. \"The art, the architecture, the food?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s got all that. The palace, the river, the opera. I got a taste of it, but mostly I was working. Flew in from Budapest for a poker game.\"\\n\\n \"You spent your time in-what do they call it-the Paris of Eastern Europe playing poker?\" Quinn demanded.\\n\\n \"Not all of it, just the lion\u0027s share. The game went for just over seventy-three hours.\"\\n\\n \"Three days, playing poker?\" Cybil\u0027s eyebrow winged up. \"Wouldn\u0027t that be a little obsessive?\"\\n\\n \"Depends on where you stand, doesn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"But don\u0027t you need to sleep, eat? Pee?\" Layla wondered.\\n\\n \"Breaks are worked in. The seventy-three hours was actual game time. This was a private game, private home. Serious money, serious security.\"\\n\\n \"Win or lose?\" Quinn asked him with a grin.\\n\\n \"I did okay.\"\\n\\n \"Do you use your precognition to help you do okay?\" Cybil asked.\\n\\n \"That would be cheating.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it would, but that didn\u0027t answer the question.\"\\n\\n He picked up his wine, kept his eyes on hers. \"If I had to cheat to win at poker, I should be selling insurance. I don\u0027t have to cheat.\"\\n\\n \"We took an oath.\" Fox held up his hands when Gage scowled at him. \"We\u0027re in this together now. They should understand how it works for us. We took an oath when we realized we all had something extra. We wouldn\u0027t use it against anyone, or to hurt anyone, or, well, to screw anyone. We don\u0027t break our word to each other.\"\\n\\n \"In that case,\" Cybil said to Gage, \"you ought to be playing the ponies instead of cards.\"\\n\\n He flashed a grin. \"Been known to, but I like cards. Wanna play?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe later.\"\\n\\n When Cybil glanced at Quinn with a look of apology, Quinn knew what was coming. \"I guess we should get back to it,\" Cybil began. \"I have a question, a place I\u0027d like to start.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s take fifteen.\" Quinn pushed to her feet. \"Get the table cleared off, take the dog out. Just move a little. Fifteen.\"\\n\\n Cal brushed a hand over her arm as he rose with her. \"I need to check the fire anyway, probably bring in more wood. Let\u0027s do this in the living room when we\u0027re finished up.\"\\n\\n THEY LOOKED LIKE ORDINARY PEOPLE, CAL thought. Just a group of friends hanging out on a winter night. Gage had switched to coffee, and that was usual. Cal hadn\u0027t known Gage to indulge in more than a couple drinks at a time since the summer they\u0027d been seventeen. Fox was back on Coke, and he himself had opted for water.\\n\\n Clear heads, he mused. They wanted clear heads if there were questions to be answered.\\n\\n They\u0027d gone back to gender groups. Had that been automatic, even intrinsic? he wondered. The three women on the couch, Fox on the floor with Lump. He\u0027d taken a chair, and Gage stood by the fire as if he might just walk out if the topic didn\u0027t suit his mood.\\n\\n \"So.\" Cybil tucked her legs under her, let her dark eyes scan the room. \"I\u0027m wondering what was the first thing, event, instance, the first happening, we\u0027ll say, that alerted you something was wrong in town. After your night in the clearing, after you went home.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Guthrie and the fork.\" Fox stretched out, propped his head on Lump\u0027s belly. \"That was a big clue.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like the title of a kid\u0027s book.\" Quinn made a note on her pad. \"Why don\u0027t you fill us in?\"\\n\\n \"You take it, Cal,\" Fox suggested.\\n\\n \"It would\u0027ve been our birthday-the night, or really the evening of it. We were all pretty spooked. It was worse being separated, each of us in our own place. I talked my mother into letting me go in to the bowling center, so I\u0027d have something to do, and Gage would be there. She couldn\u0027t figure out whether to ground me or not,\" he said with a half smile. \"First and last time I remember her being undecided on that kind of issue. So she let me go in with my father. Gage?\"\\n\\n \"I was working. Mr. Hawkins let me earn some spending money at the center, mopping up spills or carrying grill orders out to tables. I know I felt a hell of a lot better when Cal came in. Then Fox.\"\\n\\n \"I nagged my parents brainless to let me go in. My father finally caved, took me. I think he wanted to have a confab with Cal\u0027s dad, and Gage\u0027s if he could.\"\\n\\n \"So, Brian-Mr. O\u0027Dell-and my dad sat down at the end of the counter, having coffee. They didn\u0027t bring Bill, Gage\u0027s father, into it at that point.\"\\n\\n \"Because he didn\u0027t know I\u0027d been gone in the first place,\" Gage said. \"No point getting me in trouble until they\u0027d decided what to do.\"\\n\\n \"Where was your father?\" Cybil asked.\\n\\n \"Around. Behind the pins. He was having a few sober hours, so Mr. Hawkins had him working on something.\"\\n\\n \"Ball return, lane two,\" Cal murmured. \"I remember. It seemed like an ordinary summer night. Teenagers, some college types on the pinballs and video games. Grill smoking, pins crashing. There was a kid-two or three years old, I guess-with a family in the four lane. Major tantrum. The mother hauled him outside right before it happened.\"\\n\\n He took a swig of water. He could see it, bell clear. \"Mr. Guthrie was at the counter, drinking a beer, eating a dog and fries. He came in once a week. Nice enough guy. Sold flooring, had a couple of kids in high school. Once a week, he came in when his wife went to the movies with girlfriends. It was clockwork. And Mr. Guthrie would order a dog and fries, and get steadily trashed. My dad used to say he did his drinking there because he could tell himself it wasn\u0027t real drinking if he wasn\u0027t in a bar.\"\\n\\n \"Troublemaker?\" Quinn asked as she made another note.\\n\\n \"Anything but. He was what my dad called an affable drunk. He never got mean, or even sloppy. Tuesday nights, Mr. Guthrie came in, got a dog and fries, drank four or five beers, watched some games, talked to whoever was around. Somewhere around eleven, he\u0027d leave a five-dollar tip on the grill and walk home. Far as I know he didn\u0027t so much as crack a Bud otherwise. It was a Tuesday night deal.\"\\n\\n \"He used to buy eggs from us,\" Fox remembered. \"A dozen brown eggs, every Saturday morning. Anyway.\"\\n\\n \"It was nearly ten, and Mr. Guthrie was having another beer. He was walking by the tables with it,\" Cal said. \"Probably going to take it and stand behind the lanes, watch some of the action. Some guys were having burgers. Frank Dibbs was one of them-held his league\u0027s record for high game, coached Little League. We were sitting at the next table, eating pizza. Dad told us to take a break, so we were splitting a pizza. Dibbs said, \u0027Hey, Guth, the wife wants new vinyl in the kitchen. What kind of deal can you give me?\u0027\\n\\n \"And Guthrie, he just smiles. One of those tight-lipped smiles that don\u0027t show any teeth. He picks up one of the forks sitting on the table. He jammed it into Dibbs\u0027s cheek, just stabbed it into his face, and kept walking. People are screaming and running, and, Christ, that fork is just sticking out of Mr. Dibbs\u0027s cheek, and blood\u0027s sliding down his face. And Mr. Guthrie strolls over behind lane two, and drinks his beer.\"\\n\\n To give himself a moment, Cal took a long drink. \"My dad wanted us out. Everything was going crazy, except Guthrie, who apparently was crazy. Your dad took care of Dibbs,\" Cal said to Fox. \"I remember how he kept his head. Dibbs had already yanked the fork out, and your father grabbed this stack of napkins and got the bleeding stopped. There was blood on his hands when he drove us home.\"\\n\\n Cal shook his head. \"Not the point. Fox\u0027s dad took us home. Gage came with me-my father took care of that. He didn\u0027t get home until it was light out. I heard him come home; my mother had waited for him. I heard him tell her they had Guthrie locked up, and he was just sitting in his cell laughing. Laughing like it was all a big joke. Later, when it was all over, he didn\u0027t even remember. Nobody remembered much of what went on that week, or if they did, they put it away. He never came in the center again. They moved away the next winter.\"\\n\\n \"Was that the only thing that happened that night?\" Cybil asked after a moment.\\n\\n \"Girl was raped.\" Gage set his empty mug on the mantel. \"Making out with her boyfriend out on Dog Street. He didn\u0027t stop when she said stop, didn\u0027t stop when she started to cry, to scream. He raped her in the backseat of his secondhand Buick, then shoved her out on the side of the road and drove off. Wrapped his car around a tree a couple hours later. Ended up in the same hospital as she did. Only he didn\u0027t make it.\"\\n\\n \"Family mutt attacked an eight-year-old boy,\" Fox added. \"Middle of that night. The dog had slept with the kid every night for three years. The parents woke up hearing the kid screaming, and when they got to the bedroom, the dog went for them, too. The father had to beat it off with the kid\u0027s baseball bat.\"\\n\\n \"It just got worse from there. That night, the next night.\" Cal took a long breath. \"Then it didn\u0027t always wait for night. Not always.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a pattern to it.\" Quinn spoke quietly, then glanced up when Cal\u0027s voice cut through her thoughts.\\n\\n \"Where? Other than ordinary people turn violent or psychotic?\"\\n\\n \"We saw what happened with Lump. You\u0027ve just told us about another family pet. There have been other incidents like that. Now you\u0027ve said the first overt incident all of you witnessed involved a man who\u0027d had several beers. His alcohol level was probably over the legal limit, meaning he was impaired. Mind\u0027s not sharp after drinking like that. You\u0027re more susceptible.\"\\n\\n \"So Guthrie was easier to influence or infect because he was drunk or well on the way?\" Fox pushed up to sitting. \"That\u0027s good. That makes good sense.\"\\n\\n \"The boy who raped his girlfriend of three months then drove into a tree hadn\u0027t been drinking.\" Gage shook his head. \"Where\u0027s that in the pattern?\"\\n\\n \"Sexual arousal and frustration tend to impair the brain.\" Quinn tapped her pencil on her pad. \"Put those into a teenage boy, and that says susceptible to me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a valid point.\" Cal shoved his hand through his hair. Why hadn\u0027t they seen it themselves? \"The dead crows. There were a couple dozen dead crows all over Main Street the morning of our birthday that year. Some broken windows where they\u0027d repeatedly flown into the glass. We always figured that was part of it. But nobody got hurt.\"\\n\\n \"Does it always start that way?\" Layla asked. \"Can you pinpoint it?\"\\n\\n \"The first I remember from the next time was when the Myerses found their neighbor\u0027s dog drowned in a backyard swimming pool. There was the woman who left her kid locked in the car and went into the beauty salon, got a manicure and so on. It was in the nineties that day,\" Fox added. \"Somebody heard the kid crying, called the cops. They got the kid out, but when they went in to get the woman, she said she didn\u0027t have a baby. Didn\u0027t know what they were talking about. It came out she\u0027d been up two nights running because the baby had colic.\"\\n\\n \"Sleep deprivation.\" Quinn wrote it down.\\n\\n \"But we knew it was happening again,\" Cal said slowly, \"we knew for sure on the night of our seventeenth when Lisa Hodges walked out of the bar at Main and Battlefield, stripped down naked, and started shooting at passing cars with the twenty-two she had in her purse.\"\\n\\n \"We were one of the cars,\" Gage added. \"Good thing for all concerned her aim was lousy.\"\\n\\n \"She caught your shoulder,\" Fox reminded him.\\n\\n \"She shot you?\"\\n\\n Gage smiled easily at Cybil. \"Grazed me, and we heal fast. We managed to get the gun from her before she shot anyone else, or got hit by a car as she was standing buck naked in the middle of the street. Then she offered us blow jobs. Rumor was she gave a doozy, but we weren\u0027t much in the mood to find out.\"\\n\\n \"All right, from pattern to theory.\" Quinn rose to her feet to work it out. \"The thing we\u0027ll call Twisse, because it\u0027s better to have a name for it, requires energy. We\u0027re all made up of energy, and Twisse needs it to manifest, to work. When he\u0027s out, during this time Dent is unable to hold him, he seeks out the easiest sources of energy first. Birds and animals, people who are most vulnerable. As he gets stronger, he\u0027s able to move up the chain.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think the way to stop him is to clear out all the pets,\" Gage began, \"ban alcohol, drugs, and sex and make sure everyone gets a good night\u0027s sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Too bad,\" Cybil tossed back, \"because it might buy us some time. Keep going, Q.\"\\n\\n \"Next question would be, how does he generate the energy he needs?\"\\n\\n \"Fear, hate, violence.\" Cal nodded. \"We\u0027ve got that. We can\u0027t cut off his supply because you can\u0027t block those emotions out of the population. They exist.\"\\n\\n \"So do their counterparts, so we can hypothesize that those are weapons or countermeasures against him. You\u0027ve all gotten stronger over time, and so has he. Maybe he\u0027s able to store some of this energy he pulls in during the dormant period.\"\\n\\n \"And so he\u0027s able to start sooner, start stronger the next time. Okay,\" Cal decided. \"Okay, it makes sense.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s using some of that store now,\" Layla put in, \"because he doesn\u0027t want all six of us to stick this out. He wants to fracture the group before July.\"\\n\\n \"He must be disappointed.\" Cybil picked up the wine she\u0027d nursed throughout the discussion. \"Knowledge is power and all that, and it\u0027s good to have logical theories, more areas to research. But it seems to be we need to move. We need a strategy. Got any, Mr. Strategy?\"\\n\\n From his spot on the floor, Fox grinned. \"Yeah. I say as soon as the snow melts enough for us to get through it, we go to the clearing. We go to the Pagan Stone, all of us together. And we double-dog dare the son of a bitch.\"\\n\\n IT SOUNDED GOOD IN THEORY. IT WAS A DIFFERENT matter, in Cal\u0027s mind, when you added the human factor. When you added Quinn. He\u0027d taken her there once before, and he\u0027d zoned out, leaving her alone and vulnerable.\\n\\n And he hadn\u0027t loved her then.\\n\\n He knew there was no choice, that there were bigger stakes involved. But the idea of putting her at risk, at deliberately putting her at the center of it with him, kept him awake and restless.\\n\\n He wandered the house, checking locks, staring out windows for any glimpse of the thing that stalked them. The moon was out, and the snow tinted blue under it. They\u0027d be able to shovel their way out the next day, he thought, dig out the cars. Get back to what passed for normal within a day or two.\\n\\n He already knew if he asked her to stay, just stay, she\u0027d tell him she couldn\u0027t leave Layla and Cybil on their own. He already knew he\u0027d have to let her go.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t protect her every hour of every day, and if he tried, they\u0027d end up smothering each other.\\n\\n As he moved through the living room, he saw the glow of the kitchen lights. He headed back to turn them off and check locks. And there was Gage, sitting at the counter playing solitaire with a mug of coffee steaming beside the discard pile.\\n\\n \"A guy who drinks black coffee at one a.m. is going to be awake all night.\"\\n\\n \"It never keeps me up.\" Gage flipped a card, made his play. \"When I want to sleep, I sleep. You know that. What\u0027s your excuse?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s going to be a long, hard, messy hike into the woods even if we wait a month. Which we probably should.\"\\n\\n \"No. Red six on black seven. You\u0027re trying to come up with a way to go in without Quinn. Without any of them, really, but especially the blonde.\"\\n\\n \"I told you how it was when we went in before.\"\\n\\n \"And she walked out again on her own two sexy legs. Jack of clubs on queen of diamonds. I\u0027m not worried about her. I\u0027m worried about you.\"\\n\\n Cal\u0027s back went up. \"Is there a time I didn\u0027t handle myself?\"\\n\\n \"Not up until now. But you\u0027ve got it bad, Hawkins. You\u0027ve got it bad for the blonde, and being you, your first and last instinct is going to be to cover her ass if anything goes down.\"\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t it be?\" He didn\u0027t want any damn coffee, but since he doubted he\u0027d sleep anyway, he poured some. \"Why wouldn\u0027t it be?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d lay money that your blonde can handle herself. Doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re wrong, Cal. I imagine if I had a woman inside me the way she\u0027s inside you, I wouldn\u0027t want to put how she handled herself to the test. The trouble is, you\u0027re going to have to.\"\\n\\n \"I never wanted to feel this way,\" Cal said after a moment. \"This is a good part of the reason why. We\u0027re good together, Gage.\"\\n\\n \"I can see that for myself. Don\u0027t know what she sees in a loser like you, but it\u0027s working for her.\"\\n\\n \"We could get better. I can feel we\u0027d just get better, make something real and solid. If we had the chance, if we had the time, we\u0027d make something together.\"\\n\\n Casually, Gage gathered up the cards, shuffled them with a blur of speed. \"You think we\u0027re going down this time.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Cal looked out the window at the cold, blue moonlight. \"I think we\u0027re going down. Don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Odds are.\" Gage dealt them both a hand of blackjack. \"But hell, who wants to live forever?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the problem. Now that I\u0027ve found Quinn, forever sounds pretty damn good.\" Cal glanced at his hole card, noted the king to go with his three. \"Hit me.\"\\n\\n With a grin, Gage flipped over a nine. \"Sucker.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-brothers-sign-of-seven-1/page-20.html","bookId":2248,"book":{"id":2248,"title":"Blood Brothers (Sign of Seven #1)","description":"Storyline: Blood Brothers (Sign of Seven #1) \\n Every seven years, there comes a week in July when the locals do unspeakable things--and then don\u0027t seem to remember them.
