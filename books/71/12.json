{"id":1920,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"At the foot of the stairway Cudyk saw Burgess standing, blinking uncertainly around him. He dropped back and put his hand on the man\u0027s arm. \"Hello, Louis. I\u0027m glad to see you. How is Kathy?\" Burgess straightened a trifle. \"Oh—Laszlo. She\u0027s all right, thank you. Feeling a little low, just now, of course....\" His voice trailed off. \"Of course,\" said Cudyk sympathetically. \"I wish there were something I could do.\" \"No—no, there\u0027s nothing. Time will cure her, I suppose. Where are you going now?\" Cudyk explained. \"Were you at the meeting, earlier?\" he asked. \"No. I was not invited. I only heard—ten minutes ago. Perhaps it would be all right if I came upstairs with you? In that way—But if I would be a nuisance—\" His features worked. Cudyk felt obscurely uneasy. He recalled suddenly that it was a long time since he had seen Burgess looking perfectly normal. He said reluctantly, \"I think it will be all right. Why not? Come along.\" Rack was sitting at the end of the long table on the far side of the room, talking to Ferguson. Ferguson\u0027s hatchet-man, Vic Smalley, was leaning watchfully against the far wall. Monk and Spider sat at Rack\u0027s left. De Grasse, pale and red-eyed, sat halfway down the table, away from the others. He stared at the table in front of him, paying no attention to the rest. Cudyk had heard that De Grasse was still with Rack, and had wondered what he had done to expiate his sin. The obvious answer was one that he had not wanted to believe: that De Grasse had been given the task of murdering Harkway. He had done it, probably, with a tormented soul and under Rack\u0027s eye, but he had done it. So much, Cudyk thought wearily, for the selfless nobility of man. Rack looked up expressionlessly as the five men approached. \"Yes?\" Cudyk said, \"We have been chosen to ask you some questions about your previous statement.\" \"Ask away,\" said Rack, leaning back in his chair. Before him was a glass of the dark, smoky liquor Ferguson imported for his special use. He was smoking a tremendously long, black Russian cigarette. Cudyk took the list from Paz and read the first question. \"What is the status of New Earth as to housing, utilities and so on?\" \"Housing and utilities are adequate for the present population,\" said Rack indifferently. \"More units will be built as needed.\" Paz scribbled in his notebook. Cudyk read, \"Will every new colonist be expected to serve as a member of New Earth\u0027s fighting forces?\" Rack said, \"Every man will work where he\u0027s needed. Common sense ought to tell you that middle-aged men with pot bellies and no military training won\u0027t be asked to man battleships.\" \"What is the size of New Earth\u0027s navy?\" \"Next question.\" \"Will new colonists be allowed to retain their personal fortunes?\" Rack stared at him coldly. \"The man who asked that,\" he said, \"had better stay in the Quarter. If by his personal fortune he means Galactic currency, he can use it to stuff rat-holes. Any personal property of value to the community, and in excess of the owner\u0027s minimum needs, will be commandeered and dispensed for the good of the community.\" \"Will new colonists be under military dis—\" \"Look out!\" said De Grasse suddenly. He lurched to his feet, upsetting his chair. Someone stumbled against Paz, who fell heavily across Cudyk\u0027s legs, bringing him down. Someone else shouted. From the floor, Cudyk saw Burgess standing quietly with a tiny nickeled revolver in his hand. \"Please don\u0027t move, Mr. Ferguson,\" said Burgess. \"I don\u0027t trust you. All of you, stand still, please.\" Cudyk carefully got his legs under him and slowly stood up. The men on the other side of the table were still sitting or standing where they had been a moment before. De Grasse stood in an attitude of frozen protest, one big hand flat against his trousers pocket. He looked comically like a man who has left the house without his keys. They must have taken his gun away, Cudyk thought, after that affair yesterday. Monk and the aged Spider were sitting tensely, trying to watch Rack and Burgess at the same time. Rack, as always, was inhumanly calm. Ferguson looked frightened. The gunman, Vic Smalley, had straightened away from the wall; he looked alert and unworried. \"Captain Rack,\" said Burgess, \"you killed that man Harkway.\" Rack said nothing. \"I did it,\" De Grasse said hoarsely. \"If you have to shoot somebody, shoot me.\" Burgess turned slightly. Rack, without seeming to hurry, picked up the glass in front of him and half rose to fling the black liquor at Burgess\u0027 face. The gun went off. Burgess stumbled back a step and then toppled over, with a knife-handle sprouting magically between neck and shoulder. De Grasse came hurtling across the table top, dived onto Burgess\u0027 prostrate body and came up with the gun. Not more than two seconds had gone by since Rack lifted the glass. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/2922/80394.html","bookId":71,"book":{"id":71,"title":"The Earth Quarter","description":"简介： The sun had set half an hour before.
