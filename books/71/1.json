{"id":1909,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"The sun had set half an hour before. Now, from the window of Laszlo Cudyk\u0027s garret, he could see how the alien city shone frost-blue against the black sky; the tall hive-shapes that no man would have built, glowing with their own light. Nearer, the slender drunken shafts of lamp posts marched toward him down the street, each with its prosaic yellow globe. Between them and all around, the darkness had gathered; darkness in angular shapes, the geometry of squalor. Cudyk liked this view, for at night the blackness of the Earth Quarter seemed to merge with the black sky, as if one were a minor extension of the other—a fist of space held down to the surface of the planet. He could feel, then, that he was not alone, not isolated and forgotten; that some connection still existed across all the light-years of the galaxy between him and what he had lost. And, again, the view depressed him; for at night the City seemed to press in upon the Quarter like the walls of a prison. The Quarter: sixteen square blocks, about the size of those of an Earth city, two thousand three hundred human beings of three races, four religions, eighteen nationalities; the only remnant of the human race nearer than Capella. Cudyk felt the night breeze freshening. He glanced upward once at the frosty blaze of stars, then pulled his head back inside the window. He closed the shutters, turning to the lamp-lit table with its hopeless clutter of books, pipes and dusty miscellany. Cudyk was a man of middle height, heavy in the shoulders and chest, blunt-featured, with a shock of greying black hair. He was fifty-five years old; he remembered Earth. A drunk stumbled by in the street below, cursing monotonously to himself, paused to spit explosively into the gutter, and faded into the night. Cudyk heard him without attention. He stood with his back to the window, looking at nothing, his square fingers fumbling automatically for pipe and tobacco. Why do I torture myself with that look out the window every night? he asked himself. It\u0027s a juvenile sentimentalism. But he knew he would go on doing it. Other noises drifted up to his window, faint with distance. They grew louder. Cudyk cocked his head suddenly, turned and threw open the shutters again. That had been a scream. He could see nothing down the street; the trouble must be farther over, he thought, on Kwang-Chow-fu or Washington. The noise swelled as he listened: the unintelligible wailing of a mob. Footsteps clicked hurriedly up the stairs. Cudyk went to the door, made sure it was latched, and waited. There was a light tapping on the door. \"Who is it?\" he said. \"Lee Far.\" He unlatched the door and opened it. The little Chinese blinked at him, his upper lip drawn up over incisors like a rodent\u0027s. \"Mr. Seu say please, you come.\" Without waiting for an answer, he turned and rapped his way down into darkness. Cudyk picked up a jacket from a wall hook, and paused for a moment to glance at the locked drawer in which he kept an ancient .32 automatic and two full clips. He shook his head impatiently and went out. Lee was waiting for him downstairs. When he saw Cudyk open the outer door, he set off down the street at a dog-trot. Cudyk caught up with him at the corner of Athenai and Brasil. They turned right for two blocks to Washington, then left again. A block away, at Rossiya and Washington, there was a small crowd of men struggling in the middle of the street. They didn\u0027t seem to be very active; as Cudyk and Lee approached, they saw that only a few were still fighting, and those without a great deal of spirit. The rest were moving aimlessly, some wiping their eyes, others bent almost double in paroxysms of sneezing. A few were motionless on the pavement. Three slender Chinese were moving through the crowd. Each had a white surgeon\u0027s mask tied over his nose and mouth, and carried a plastic bag full of some dark substance, from which he took handfuls and flung them with a motion like a sower\u0027s. Cudyk could see now that the air around them was heavy with floating particles. As he watched, the last two fighters in the crowd each took a halfhearted swing at the other and then, coughing and sneezing, moved away in separate directions. Lee took his sleeve for a moment. \"Here, Mr. Cudyk.\" Seu was standing in the doorway of Town Hall, his round-bellied bulk almost filling it. He saluted Cudyk with a lazy, humorous gesture of one fat hand. \"Hello, Min,\" Cudyk said. \"You\u0027re efficient, as always. Pepper again?\" \"Yes,\" said Mayor Seu Min. \"I hate to waste it, but I don\u0027t think the water buckets would have been enough this time. This could have been a bad one.\" \"How did it start?\" \"A couple of Russkies caught Jim Loong sneaking into Madame May\u0027s,\" the fat man said laconically. His shrewd eyes twinkled. \"I\u0027m glad you came down, Laszlo. I want you to meet an important visitor who arrived on the Kt-I\u0027ith ship this afternoon.\" He turned slightly, and Cudyk saw that there was a man behind him in the doorway. \"Mr. Harkway, may I present Mr. Laszlo Cudyk, one of our leading citizens? Mr. Cudyk, James Harkway, who is here on a mission from the Minority People\u0027s League.\" Cudyk shook hands with the man, who had a pale, scholarly face, not bad-looking, with dark intense eyes. He was young, about thirty. Cudyk automatically classified him as second generation. \"Perhaps,\" said Seu, as if the notion had just occurred to him, \"you would not mind taking over my duties as host for a short time, Laszlo? If Mr. Harkway would not object? This regrettable occurrence—\" \"Of course,\" Cudyk said. Harkway nodded and smiled. \"Excellent.\" Seu edged past Cudyk, then turned and put a hand on his friend\u0027s arm, drawing him closer. \"Take care of this fool,\" he said under his breath, \"and for God\u0027s sake keep him away from the saloons. Rack is in town, too. I\u0027ve got to make sure they don\u0027t meet.\" He smiled cheerfully at both of them and walked away. Lee Far, appearing from somewhere, trailed after him. A young Chinese, with blood streaming brightly from a gash in his cheek, was stumbling past. Cudyk stepped away from the doorway, turned him around and pointed him down the street, to where Seu\u0027s young men were laying out the victims on the sidewalk and administering first aid. Cudyk went back to Harkway. \"I suppose Seu has found you a place to stay,\" he said. \"Yes,\" said Harkway. \"He\u0027s putting me up in his home. Perhaps I\u0027d better go there now—I don\u0027t want to be in the way.\" \"You won\u0027t be in the way,\" Cudyk told him. \"What would you like to do?\" \"Well, I\u0027d like to meet a few people, if it isn\u0027t too late. Perhaps we could have a drink somewhere, where people meet—?\" He glanced interrogatively down the street to an illuminated sign that announced in English and Russian: \"THE LITTLE BEAR. Wines and Liquors.\" \"Not there,\" said Cudyk. \"That\u0027s Russky headquarters, and I\u0027m afraid they may be a little short-tempered right now. The best place would be Chong Yin\u0027s tea room, I think. That\u0027s just two blocks up, near Washington and Ceskoslovensko.\" \"All right,\" said Harkway. He was still looking down the street. \"Who is that girl?\" he asked abruptly. Cudyk glanced that way. The two M. D.\u0027s, Moskowitz and Estrada, were on the scene, sorting out the most serious cases to be carted off to hospital, and so was a slender, dark-haired girl in nurse\u0027s uniform. \"That\u0027s Kathy Burgess,\" he said. \"I\u0027d introduce you, but now isn\u0027t the time. You\u0027ll probably meet her tomorrow.\" \"She\u0027s very pretty,\" said Harkway, and suffered himself to be led off up the street. \"Married?\" \"No. She was engaged to one of our young men, but her father broke it off.\" \"Oh?\" said Harkway. After a moment: \"Political differences?\" \"Yes. The young man joined the activists. The father is a conservative.\" \"That\u0027s very interesting,\" said Harkway. After a moment he asked, \"Do you have many of those here?\" \"Activists or conservatives? Or pretty girls?\" \"I meant conservatives,\" said Harkway, coloring slightly. \"I know the activist movement is strong here—that\u0027s why I was sent. We consider them dangerous in the extreme.\" \"So do I,\" said Cudyk. \"No, there aren\u0027t many conservatives. Burgess is the only real fanatic. If you meet him, by the way, you must make certain allowances.\" Harkway nodded thoughtfully. \"Cracked on the subject?\" \"You could put it that way,\" Cudyk told him. \"He has convinced himself, in his conscious mind at least, that we are the dominant species on this planet; that the Niori are our social and economic inferiors. He won\u0027t tolerate any suggestion that it isn\u0027t so.\" Harkway nodded again, looking very solemn. \"A tragedy,\" he said. \"But understandable, of course. Some of the older people simply can\u0027t adjust to the reality of our position in the galaxy.\" \"Not many people actually like it,\" said Cudyk. Harkway looked at him thoughtfully. He said, \"Mr. Cudyk, I don\u0027t want you to take this as a complaint, but I\u0027ve gathered the impression that you\u0027re not in sympathy with the Minority People\u0027s League.\" \"No,\" said Cudyk. \"May I ask what your political viewpoint is?\" \"I\u0027m neutral,\" said Cudyk. \"Apolitical.\" Harkway said politely, \"I hope you won\u0027t take offense if I ask why? It\u0027s evident, even to me, that you\u0027re a man of intelligence and ability.\" Everything is evident to you, Cudyk thought wearily, except what you don\u0027t want to see. He said, \"I don\u0027t believe our particular Humpty Dumpty can be put back together again, Mr. Harkway.\" Harkway looked at him intently, but said nothing. He glanced at the signboard over the lighted windows they were approaching. \"Is this the place?\" \"Yes.\" Harkway continued to look at the sign. Above the English \"CHONG YIN\u0027S TEA ROOM\", and the Chinese characters, was a legend that read: \"That\u0027s a curious alphabet,\" he said. \"It\u0027s a very efficient one,\" Cudyk told him. \"It\u0027s based on the design of an X in a rectangle—like this.\" He traced it with his finger on the wall. \"Counting each arm of the cross as one stroke, there are eight strokes in the figure. Using only two strokes to a letter, there are twenty-eight possible combinations. They use the sixteen most graceful ones, and add twenty-seven three-stroke letters to bring it up to forty-three, one for each sound in their language. The written language is completely phonetic, therefore. But there are only eight keys on a Niori typewriter.\" He looked at Harkway. \"It\u0027s also perfectly legible: no letter looks too much like any other letter. And it has a certain beauty, don\u0027t you think?\" He paused. \"Hasn\u0027t it struck you, Mr. Harkway, that anything our hosts do is likely to be a little more sensible and more sensitive than the human equivalent?\" \"I come from Reg Otay,\" said Harkway. \"They don\u0027t have any visual arts or any written language there. But I see what you mean. What does the sign say—the same thing as the English?\" \"No. It says, \u0027Yungiwo Ren Trakru Rith.\u0027 \u0027Trakru rith\u0027 is Niori for \u0027hospitality house\u0027—it\u0027s what they call anything that we would call tea room, or restaurant, or beer garden.\" \"And \u0027Yungiwo Ren\u0027?\" \"That\u0027s their version of \u0027Chung kuo jen\u0027[A]—the Chinese for \u0027Chinese.\u0027 At first they called us all that, because most of the original immigrants were from China; but they\u0027ve got over it now—they found out some of us didn\u0027t like it.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/2922/80383.html","bookId":71,"book":{"id":71,"title":"The Earth Quarter","description":"简介： The sun had set half an hour before.
