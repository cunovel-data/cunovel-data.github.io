Ferguson took a cigar, twirled it in his lips slowly, and lit it. \"You know,\" he said, bending forward, \"there\u0027s plenty of planets in the galaxy that aren\u0027t inhabited. Some have never even been explored. They\u0027re off the shipping routes, no intelligent race on them, nothing special in the way of organic products, so nobody wants them. Rack\u0027s got one—I\u0027ve got another.\" He gestured with the cigar. \"But I\u0027m not using mine to build up any war base. What for?\" His long face contorted with violent disgust. \"That Rack is crazy. You know it and I know it. If it wasn\u0027t for him, I could have stayed here, who knows how long? Or I could have moved to one of the other colonies if I saw a good chance. I like it here. This is civilization—all that\u0027s left of it. \"But—\" he leaned back again—\"you got to take what you can get. If the odds are too heavy, cash in and walk out. That\u0027s what I\u0027m doing: I\u0027m retiring. On this planet I told you about, there\u0027s a big island. A tropical island. Fruit—all you can eat. Little animals something like wild pigs. Fish in the ocean. Gravity just a little under Earth normal, atmosphere perfect. And I\u0027m taking along everything else we\u0027ll need. Generators, all kinds of electrical equipment, stoves, everything. It\u0027ll last your lifetime and mine.\" He looked at Cudyk. \"What more would you want?\" Cudyk said slowly, \"You\u0027re asking me to go with you?\" Ferguson nodded. \"Sure. I\u0027ll treat you right, Cudyk. My boys will go on working for me, you understand, and so will most of the others I\u0027m going to take. I\u0027ll be the boss. But you, and three or four others, you won\u0027t have to do any work. Just lie in that sand, or go fishing, or whatever you feel like. How does it sound?\" \"I don\u0027t think I quite understand,\" said Cudyk. \"Why do you choose me?\" Ferguson put down his cigar. He looked uncomfortable. He said irritably, \"Because I\u0027ve got to have somebody to talk to.\" He stared at Cudyk. \"Look at me. Here I am, I\u0027m fifty years old, and I been fighting the world ever since I was a kid. You think I can just cut loose from everything now, and lie under a tree? I\u0027d go nuts in a month. I\u0027m not kidding myself, I know what I am. It takes practice to learn how to relax and enjoy yourself. I never learned, never had the time. \"When I get on that island, and I get all the houses built and the wires strung up, and everything\u0027s organized and I\u0027ve got nothing else to do, I can see myself lying there thinking about this place, and all the other places I ever owned, and thinking to myself, \u0027What for?\u0027 And there\u0027s no answer, I know that. But just the same, I\u0027m going to be wanting to start in again, making a deal, opening a joint, figuring the angles, handling people. \"So there I\u0027ll be, with all these mugs around me. What do they know to talk about? The same things I do. Things that happened to them in the rackets, here or back on Earth. You got to talk to somebody, or you go crazy. But if I\u0027ve got nobody but them to talk to, how\u0027m I ever going to get my mind off that kind of stuff?\" He gestured toward the Roualt, on the wall to Cudyk\u0027s left. \"Look at that,\" he said. \"I bought that thing in 1991. I\u0027ve been looking at it for, let\u0027s see, twenty-three years. For the first five or so I couldn\u0027t figure out whether the guy was kidding or not. Then, gradually, I got to like it. But I still don\u0027t know why the hell I like it. It\u0027s the same thing with everything. I have a Corot that I\u0027m nuts about—I look at it every night before I go to sleep. It\u0027s just a landscape, like you used to see on calendars in the old days, except the calendars were junk and this is art. I know that, I can feel it. But what\u0027s the difference between the two? Don\u0027t ask me. \"See what I mean? That\u0027s the kind of stuff I got to learn about. Art. Literature. Music. Philosophy. I always wanted to, before, but I never had the patience for it. Now I\u0027ve got to do it. My kind of life is finished, I\u0027ve got to learn a new kind.\" He frowned at his cigar. \"It isn\u0027t going to be easy. Maybe there\u0027ll be times when you\u0027ll wish you had anybody else in the world around but me. But I won\u0027t take it out on you, Cudyk.\" He meant it, Cudyk knew. For a moment he wondered, Why don\u0027t I accept? He could see Ferguson\u0027s island paradise clearly enough: the tropical trees, the log huts—with electric light, induction stoves for cooking, and hot and cold water—the sand, the sunshine, the long, lazy afternoons spent in talking quietly on the beach. There would be no strain and no tension, if everything went as Ferguson planned—only a long, slow twilight, with nothing left to fear or to hope for: forgetfulness, lethargy; lotos and Lethe; a pleasant exile, a scented prison. \"You won\u0027t have to worry about the others, the guys that work for me,\" Ferguson said. \"After they get through building the settlement, they can do what they want as long as they don\u0027t make any trouble. There\u0027ll be enough women to go around—they can settle down and raise kids. There won\u0027t be any liquor, and I\u0027m going to keep the weapons locked up. About the ship—I\u0027ll wreck that as soon as we land. Once we\u0027re there, we\u0027re there.\" If it were not for Ferguson himself, Cudyk thought, I believe I might do it. But Ferguson, inside a year, is going to be a pitiable and terrible object. This is his own punishment, his lesser evil—he chooses it himself. But he is not going to like it. \"I think I understand,\" he said. \"Believe me, Mr. Ferguson, I\u0027m deeply grateful for this offer, and I am tempted to accept. But—I think I will stay and take my chances with the Quarter.\" Ferguson stared at him, then shrugged. \"Don\u0027t make up your mind in too much of a hurry,\" he said. \"Think it over—I\u0027m not leaving for a couple of weeks. And listen, Cudyk, do me a favor. Don\u0027t spread this around.\" \"Very well,\" said Cudyk. Ferguson did not get up to see him to the door. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/2922/80398.html","bookId":71,"book":{"id":71,"title":"The Earth Quarter","description":"简介： The sun had set half an hour before.
