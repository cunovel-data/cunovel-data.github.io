{"id":2338,"title":"Tanner\u0027s Virgin (Evan Tanner #6)","description":"Storyline: Tanner\u0027s Virgin (Evan Tanner #6) \\n The CIA, the FBI, the KGB, Interpolâ€”not one of the world\u0027s premier intelligence organizations knows quite what to make of Evan Michael Tanner. Is he a spy, a mercenary, a footloose adventurer, or simply a screwball sucker for hopeless causes? \\n (Actually he\u0027s a little bit of all of the above. Plus he never sleeps. Ever.) \\n One thing\u0027s for sure: Tanner\u0027s a true romantic, which is why he can\u0027t refuse a distraught mother who begs him to rescue her lost, pure-as-driven-snow daughter. Phaedra Harrow (nee Deborah Horowitz) once shared Tanner\u0027s apartment but not his bed. And now the virginal beauty\u0027s been abducted by white slavers in the Afghan wilderness. \\n Finding Phaedra will be difficult enough. Bringing her back alive and unmolested may be impossible. And first Tanner will have to swim the English Channel, survive trigger-happy Russian terrorists . . . and maybe pull off a timely assassination or two.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tanner-s-virgin-evan-tanner-6.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
