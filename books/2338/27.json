He posed as a travel agent, offering fully escorted women-only tours of Afghanistan at an irresistibly low price, and managing to screen out any applicants with close family ties or persons likely to keep tabs on them. Once he had a group of a dozen or so nubile and unattached young women on board, he promptly escorted them to Afghanistan, where he sold the lot of them for whatever the going rate may have been and left them to get on with their lives, or what remained thereof. “Not a nice person,” said the friend of a friend. So Afghanistan was more or less handed to me. That was a couple of wars ago, and what I knew about the country you could put in a silk ear. Or a sow’s purse. Or, less metaphorically, in the Encyclopedia Britannica, which is where I did what I had the temerity to call my research. Back then, all I knew about Afghanistan was that it was a hippie destination, because it didn’t cost much to live there. (It was even cheaper if you’d been sold into white slavery.) I knew about the hippies, and I knew about the coats that some of them (not the ones sold into white slavery) were bringing back, very attractive sheepskin garments with colorful embroidery. And I figured they must have at least one 1955 Chevy there. Well, that was then and this is now. These days, if you want a 1955 Chevy, you’ll have to go to Havana.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tanner-s-virgin-evan-tanner-6/page-27.html","bookId":2338,"book":{"id":2338,"title":"Tanner\u0027s Virgin (Evan Tanner #6)","description":"Storyline: Tanner\u0027s Virgin (Evan Tanner #6) The CIA, the FBI, the KGB, Interpol—not one of the world\u0027s premier intelligence organizations knows quite what to make of Evan Michael Tanner. Is he a spy, a mercenary, a footloose adventurer, or simply a screwball sucker for hopeless causes? (Actually he\u0027s a little bit of all of the above. Plus he never sleeps. Ever.) One thing\u0027s for sure: Tanner\u0027s a true romantic, which is why he can\u0027t refuse a distraught mother who begs him to rescue her lost, pure-as-driven-snow daughter. Phaedra Harrow (nee Deborah Horowitz) once shared Tanner\u0027s apartment but not his bed. And now the virginal beauty\u0027s been abducted by white slavers in the Afghan wilderness. Finding Phaedra will be difficult enough. Bringing her back alive and unmolested may be impossible. And first Tanner will have to swim the English Channel, survive trigger-happy Russian terrorists . . . and maybe pull off a timely assassination or two.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tanner-s-virgin-evan-tanner-6.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tanner-s-virgin-evan-tanner-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:15 AM"}}
