We\u0027re too young to get into pubs and there\u0027s not much else to do around here. They\u0027re hanging out by the swings, trying to look cool. Dipsticks! I mean, how the hell are you supposed to look cool in a park? \"Strewth, it\u0027s the B-ster,\" Trev hoots. \"And who\u0027s that with our cheery old chum? Strike me pink if it ain\u0027t our old mate Vinyl! Evening, guv\u0027nor.\" Trev loves a bit of old-time cockney slang. Sometimes it\u0027s funny but it gets stale quick. \"Anything happening?\" I ask, taking one of the swings and lifting my feet up so that everyone can admire my sneakers. \"Sod all,\" Copper says. \"Looking for zombies,\" Kray yawns. \"We thought Vinyl was one of them,\" Ballydefeck says. \"Eat me,\" Vinyl retorts. \"I wouldn\u0027t even if I was a zombie,\" Ballydefeck sniffs. \"Anyone else coming?\" I ask. Trev shrugs. \"Talk of a curfew has scared a lot of people. I\u0027m not expecting many more. Surprised to see you, B. I thought you\u0027d have been kept in.\" \"It\u0027d take more than the threat of a few zombies to keep me in,\" I sneer. \"Aren\u0027t you afraid of the living dead?\" Kray asks. \"I\u0027m more afraid of your killer breath.\" Laughter all round. I grin. It\u0027s great to have friends to slag off. Copper produces a packet of cigs and passes them around. He\u0027s good that way. He\u0027d share his last butt with you. He used to take a lot of flack for being a ginger before he butched up, but I always liked him. I slagged him off, sure - and I gave him his nickname - but in a nice way. I\u0027ve given a few of my friends nicknames over the years. I\u0027m good at it. You\u0027d be amazed how some people struggle. It doesn\u0027t take a stroke of genius to look at a redhead and call him Copper, but even that simple task is beyond a lot of the kids I know. I\u0027m prouder of Ballydefeck. His family\u0027s Irish. Most of us have a bit of Paddy in our blood, but his lot act like they still live in the bog, spuds for dinner every night of the week, Irish dancing competitions on the weekend, Daniel O\u0027Donnell blasting out loud in every room of their house if you pop round. He was known as Paddy or Mick for years. Then one night I was watching a rerun of Father Ted. An old priest in it kept cursing, saying, \"Feck!\" I put that together with the name of an Irish village and came up with Ballydefeck. He\u0027s answered to that ever since. Kray digs out an iPod with a plug-in speaker. It\u0027s brand-new, the latest model. I whistle appreciatively. \"Fall off the back of a truck?\" I ask. \"I don\u0027t know what you mean,\" Kray says indignantly, but his smirk ruins his show of innocence. We\u0027ve all nicked a bit in our time but Kray would have been Fagin\u0027s star student. We listen to some good tunes - Kray has great taste - and talk about TV, zombies, music, sex. Vinyl tells us about the girls in his new school. He says they\u0027re hot and easy. Trev, Copper and Ballydefeck listen with their mouths open as he describes what he\u0027s been getting up to with them. Me and Kray look at each other and roll our eyes - we know bullshit when we smell it. But we don\u0027t tell Vinyl to shut up. It\u0027s fun listening to him stringing the fools along. After a while I spot a skinny black teenager entering the park. It\u0027s Tyler, a kid from our year. He stops when he sees us, hesitates, then backs up. \"Tyler!\" I shout. \"Get your arse over here!\" He grins nervously and taps his watch. Vanishes before I can call to him again. \"A pity,\" I sneer. \"I fancied a lynching.\" \"That\u0027s a bit harsh, isn\u0027t it?\" Vinyl says. \"Only joking,\" I reply. \"Tyler\u0027s all right,\" Vinyl mutters. \"No, he\u0027s not,\" I growl. \"What\u0027s wrong with him?\" Vinyl challenges me, then smiles with icy sweetness before I can answer. \"It\u0027s not the color of his skin, is it?\" I scowl at Vinyl but don\u0027t say anything. Because to an extent he\u0027s right. Dad\u0027s a racist and proud of it. He hates anyone who isn\u0027t from England, especially if they\u0027re dark-skinned. In his ideal world the ruling party would be the Ku Klux Klan and he\u0027d go riding through the streets of London on a horse every day with a load of hood-wearing buddies, keeping law and order with a thick length of rope. Dad\u0027s always warning me of the dangers of racial tolerance. He pushes Aryan books and pamphlets my way. The first picture book I remember reading by myself was Little Black Sambo. I don\u0027t believe the same things that Dad does. I don\u0027t want to be like him, not that way. But at the same time I\u0027ve got to live with him. I learned early on not to challenge his word. So I put up with the ranting and raving. I read the hate lit. I laugh at his crude jokes. I\u0027ve even gone to a few meetings with him, rooms full of angry white men muttering bloody murder. The trouble with putting on an act is that sometimes it\u0027s hard to tell where the actor stops and the real you begins. It\u0027s rubbed off on me to an extent, the years of pretending to hate. Vinyl\u0027s black as the ace of spades, but he\u0027s my only friend who is. And it\u0027s not just because I know Dad would hit the roof if he saw me hanging out with black kids or Muslims. Part of me genuinely fears the menace of those who are different. I\u0027ve read so much and heard so much and been forced to say so much that sometimes I forget that I don\u0027t believe it. To be honest, I\u0027m amazed I\u0027m still friends with Vinyl. We hung out together when we were tiny, before I started selecting my associates more cautiously. When Dad beat me a few times and told me to stop having anything to do with that horrible little black kid, that should have been the end of it. I tried to avoid Vinyl after that but I couldn\u0027t. We got on too well. He made me laugh, he never teased me, I could talk to him about anything. I learned to sneak behind Dad\u0027s back, never mention Vinyl at home, not be seen with him close to where we live. He\u0027s my secret friend. If Dad knew, he\u0027d knock the stuffing out of me. Even one black friend is one too many as far as he\u0027s concerned. \"Come on,\" Vinyl says again, bristling now. \"What\u0027s wrong with Tyler?\" \"I don\u0027t like his face,\" I snap. \"What difference does it make?\" \"I ran into your dad a few days ago,\" Vinyl says. \"He recognized me, which was a surprise. I thought we all looked the same to him.\" \"Hey,\" Trev says uneasily. \"Let\u0027s drop it.\" \"He told me he\u0027d heard about my new school,\" Vinyl goes on, ignoring Trev and staring hard at me. \"Said it was amazing what they could teach chimps these days. Asked me if I could peel my own bananas now.\" I feel my face flush. I\u0027m ashamed of my mean-spirited, foul-mouthed father. But I\u0027m even more ashamed of myself, because I instinctively want to defend him. I know it\u0027s wrong. He shouldn\u0027t have said that to Vinyl - to anyone - but part of me wants to take his side, because no matter what, he\u0027s my dad and I love him. \"I can\u0027t control what he says,\" I mutter, dropping my gaze. \"But do you agree with it?\" Vinyl growls. \"Of course not!\" I spit. \"Tyler\u0027s a whiny brat. He gets up my nose. It\u0027s got nothing to do with him being black.\" Vinyl eyes me coldly for a long, probing moment. Then he relaxes. \"That\u0027s all right then.\" He winks. \"You should tell your dad that you want to move in with me.\" \"Wishful thinking!\" I snort. We laugh, bump fists and everything\u0027s okay again. In a weird, messed-up, uncomfortable kind of way. It\u0027s not easy sometimes, having a racist for a dad.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-4.html","bookId":2450,"book":{"id":2450,"title":"Zom-B (Zom-B #1)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B (Zom-B #1) Zom-B is a radical new series about a zombie apocalypse, told in the first person by one of its victims. The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more. This is challenging material, which will captivate existing Shan fans and bring in many new ones. As Darren says, \"It\u0027s a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody. A high body-count is guaranteed!\"","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/zom-b-zom-b-1.jpg","author":"Darren Shan","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:23 PM"}}
