Dad looks up, happy tears sparkling in his eyes, grinning like a loon. \"Our kids aren\u0027t here. We have to push on.\" Dad\u0027s grin fades. He pats my head, then stands. The two men shake hands. There are a couple of women behind the guy with the gun, one white, one Chinese. Dad smiles sadly at the white woman but only scowls at the other one. \"You\u0027re sure you want to continue?\" Dad asks Gun Guy. \"I have to.\" He turns to the rest of us. \"Any of you know Jimmy Wilkins?\" Most of us nod. \"Have you seen him?\" We shake our heads. \"What about Lindsay Hogan?\" the white woman asks. Linzer. \"The zombies got her,\" I mutter. The woman\u0027s face hardens. \"No!\" she snaps. \"You\u0027re wrong.\" \"We saw them grab her.\" \"Where?\" she screams. I turn and point. The woman starts running. \"It was on the top floor,\" I shout. \"You\u0027re too late. She\u0027s dead.\" But the woman isn\u0027t listening. She\u0027s gone. The Chinese woman asks us if we\u0027ve seen her son and daughter, but we don\u0027t know either of them. She heads off with Gun Guy, the pair advancing swiftly, checking each room as they pass. \"It\u0027s madness,\" I whisper to Dad. \"They\u0027re gonna get killed.\" \"I know, love,\" he says. \"But that\u0027s what parents do for their kids. I knew I\u0027d probably get eaten when I came looking for you, but did that stop me? Hell no.\" I beam at him, so proud. He looks around, smiles at my friends, sniffs at the Muslims, the Indian and Tyler. \"Come on,\" he says. \"I\u0027m getting you out of here.\" We follow Dad back the way he came. He\u0027s moving quickly but he isn\u0027t racing. \"Slow down,\" he says as Trev tries to force the pace. \"But the zombies...\" Trev gasps. \"You think I don\u0027t know about them?\" Dad snorts. \"We have to get out,\" Trev insists. \"That\u0027s what we\u0027re doing,\" Dad says calmly. \"But if we go flapping around like headless chickens, we\u0027ll run into trouble, the way you lot did before I found you. These zombies aren\u0027t so tough if you\u0027re prepared for them. I\u0027ve finished off a few of them already.\" He shakes a metal bar at us - it\u0027s red with blood. \"But you have to go about it the right way, keep your head, make sure you have the time and space to spot them coming.\" He takes a left turn and we pass the staff room. The door\u0027s open. I spot a couple of teachers inside, chewing on the remains of some of their colleagues. \"They won\u0027t be failing you again,\" Dad says and we both laugh. \"Straight F\u0027s in most courses,\" I chuckle. \"But A-plus in zombie survival!\" \"Been a long time since I was a student here,\" Dad mutters nostalgically. \"But I remember the place like it was yesterday. Didn\u0027t have any trouble finding my way around.\" \"How\u0027d you get over here so quickly?\" I ask. It feels like we\u0027ve been running for hours since the gym, but it can\u0027t have been more than fifteen or twenty minutes. \"I was working nearby,\" Dad says. \"When I heard about the attacks on the radio, I ran like the wind. I tried calling ahead to check if things were all right but the phones aren\u0027t working.\" \"Then it\u0027s true?\" Elephant asks. \"This is happening in other places too?\" \"Yeah,\" Dad says. \"Schools, hospitals, shops, factories, all sorts and all over the place. Getting out of here won\u0027t be the end of it. London\u0027s in an uproar. But the zombies tend to keep to the shadows. If we stick to the main streets and roads, we should be all right. At least until night.\" \"What about Mum?\" I ask, able to think about her now that I have someone else to watch out for me. \"We\u0027ll swing by home, see if she\u0027s there,\" Dad says. \"Can\u0027t we call and get her to - \" \"Weren\u0027t you listening?\" he snaps. \"The phones are dead. Cells, landlines, the lot. TV stations are down too. A lot of radio stations as well, but a guy I work with has a top-of-the-range radio that picks up all sorts of frequencies. That\u0027s how I know it\u0027s widespread. It started about...\" He checks his watch. \"Not quite an hour ago. But I didn\u0027t hear about it immediately. As soon as I did, I came.\" He flashes me a shaky smile. \"You didn\u0027t think I\u0027d leave you to be gobbled by zombies, did you?\" I want to burst into tears and hug him again, but there\u0027s no time. We have to keep moving. We\u0027ll be relatively safe in the sunlight once we get out of here. We can hug all we want then. We move steadily through the school, drawing closer to the front of the building. For the first time since the gym I really allow myself to hope. I don\u0027t want to tempt fate but I think we\u0027ve made it. We come to a corridor that\u0027s only a few turns from the main exit. Everyone\u0027s excited. We can virtually smell freedom. There\u0027s a fire door ahead of us. Once we push through that, the corridor branches. The right turn leads back into the school. The left will lead us all the way home. Dad shoves the door. It rattles but doesn\u0027t open. He frowns and pushes it again. No joy. \"That\u0027s not right,\" he says. \"I came through here on my way in.\" The Indian kid slides up to the crack in the door and peers through. \"It\u0027s been locked,\" he moans. \"There\u0027s a chain.\" \"What?\" Dad shouts, shoving him aside and squinting through the crack. \"Who the hell did that?\" \"The mutants,\" I sigh. As if in answer, I hear a whistle blow somewhere close behind us. \"Dad! They\u0027re coming!\" Dad stares at me. He starts to ask how I know we\u0027re in trouble, then shakes his head and slams the door with his shoulder. \"Keep back,\" he grunts at those around him. \"It\u0027ll take more than a chain to hold me here.\" We stare at Dad as he rams the door again and again. It\u0027s a thick, heavy door, designed to slow the spread of flames in case of a fire. The chain is sturdy too. Dad doesn\u0027t look to be achieving much but he keeps going, sweating like a marathon runner, totally focused. I glance back down the corridor and spot four zombies slipping into it. They lock sights on us and slither forward. \"Dad!\" I wail. \"I nearly have it,\" he pants. Trev throws himself at the door, trying to help. Meths and Seez take turns too. Dad glares at them, but then there\u0027s a snapping sound and the door starts to give. \"That\u0027s the way, boys!\" Dad whoops. \"Give it everything you have.\" They hurl themselves at the door, one after the other. Their arms and shoulders will be black and blue later but they don\u0027t care. No matter how much of a battering they take, they don\u0027t back down. Elephant, Stagger Lee, the Indian and the other Muslim kid watch helplessly as Dad and the three boys fly at the door like rabid dogs. I\u0027m a bit farther back, Tyler by my side. I\u0027m looking for anything I can use to fend off the zombies but I\u0027m not having much luck. They\u0027re closing in. They could have rushed us by now, but they see that we\u0027re trapped, so they\u0027re taking their time. \"Dad!\" I yell. \"Just another few blows,\" he wheezes, launching himself at the door again. More zombies appear at the far end of the corridor, loads of them, a couple of whistle-blowing mutants in the middle, guiding them towards us. \"Dad!\" Dad looks back and whitens. \"Holy hell,\" he croaks. Meths bangs into the door and it cracks. The hinges give. Meths cheers and starts shaking the door. Dad and Seez join him. There isn\u0027t room for Trev - he\u0027s been pushed out of the way. \"They\u0027re almost on us,\" I shout. Dad looks at me, then at the zombies, and curses. \"You\u0027ve got to stall them. We only need a few more seconds.\" \"How?\" I scream. \"There\u0027s nothing I can do to - \" \"Throw them the black kid!\" Dad roars. I stare at him. Tyler stares too, both of us stunned, momentarily forgetting about the zombies. \"Do it!\" Dad shouts. \"But he\u0027s Tyler,\" I whisper. \"He\u0027s one of us. He helped us get - \" \"Throw them the bloody chimney sweep or I\u0027ll whip you raw!\" Dad screams. And suddenly I\u0027m reacting, doing what he tells me, the way I always do when he loses his temper, because it\u0027s easier to obey him than stand up to him. Years of conditioning kick in. Fear takes over. I go into my dutiful-daughter act. The racist in me swims to the fore and rejoices at being set free. On autopilot, I grab Tyler\u0027s arm and hurl him at the zombies. \"No!\" he shrieks as he stumbles towards them. \"B! No! Help me!\" Tyler crashes into the zombies. All five go down, and the zombies sprawl like bowling pins. Tyler starts to get up. Immediately guilt-stricken and appalled, I reach out to him, desperately wanting to put right what I\u0027ve done. But before I can drag him to safety, a zombie catches hold and bites Tyler\u0027s neck. Tyler chokes and stiffens, blood spurting, and I watch with horror as the other three zombies crowd around and tuck into the tasty human morsel that I\u0027ve thrown them.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-26.html","bookId":2450,"book":{"id":2450,"title":"Zom-B (Zom-B #1)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B (Zom-B #1) Zom-B is a radical new series about a zombie apocalypse, told in the first person by one of its victims. The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more. This is challenging material, which will captivate existing Shan fans and bring in many new ones. As Darren says, \"It\u0027s a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody. A high body-count is guaranteed!\"","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/zom-b-zom-b-1.jpg","author":"Darren Shan","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:23 PM"}}
