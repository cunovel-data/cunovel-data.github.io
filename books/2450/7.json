I feel like I\u0027ve been screaming, but in all these years I\u0027ve never made a sound. Mum and Dad would have told me if I had.\n I only wear underpants and a T-shirt to bed. I used to wear pajamas, but I\u0027d always sweat through them when I had the dream and have to dump them the next day.\n I get up and stagger to the bathroom. I take off the T-shirt on the way and drop it by the foot of my bed, knowing Mum will stick it in the laundry basket in the morning.\n I sit on the toilet, shivering. I don\u0027t need to pee. I just have to wait somewhere outside my bedroom for a bit, until the shakes pass.\n I hate that bloody dream. Apart from when Dad is on the rampage, it\u0027s the only time I ever feel truly scared, lost, out of my depth, helpless. What\u0027s worse, I can\u0027t tell anyone about it. What would it look like, someone my age admitting they\u0027re scared by a dream about babies? I mean, if it was cannibals or monsters or something, fair enough. But bloody babies!\n Dad would skin me if he heard I still have the nightmare. When I\u0027d go crying to him as a kid, he\u0027d tell me not to be stupid, there was nothing scary about babies. When I kept bothering him, he whipped me with his belt. He asked a few weeks later if I was still having the dream, I forced a grin and said I wasn\u0027t.\n When the shakes stop, I get up and wash my face and hands. I wipe sweat from my back with a towel, then pause and study myself in the mirror. My eyes are bloodshot and blurry with traces of fear - I think I sometimes cry quietly in my sleep - so I splash water over them and rub them with my knuckles until it hurts. Next time I check, I just look angry. That\u0027s better.\n I study my light blue eyes and admire my stubbled head. Flex my biceps. Rub a faded yellow bruise on my left arm where Dad thumped me a week ago when I didn\u0027t hand him the remote quick enough. I wink at myself and mutter, \"Looking good, B.\"\n I massage my stomach, to loosen the tightened muscles, then pick at the faded white scar near the top of my right thigh. It\u0027s a small c shape, from an injection I had when I was two or three years old. It was a new type of flu vaccine. Dad volunteered me for it - they were paying good money for guinea pigs. Mum was worried but Dad said there was no way they\u0027d test it on babies if there was any chance it would cause harm.\n He was right and it worked a treat. I\u0027ve never even had a cold. I don\u0027t know why it didn\u0027t make it to the shops. Maybe there were side effects and I\u0027m one of the lucky ones who didn\u0027t suffer any. Or maybe they have to wait a certain amount of time before they can put it on the market.\n I scowl and stop picking the c scar. The things that go through your mind at - I check my watch - 3:27 in the morning. I should be sleeping, not analyzing a dumb bloody scar. I grin at myself. \"You\u0027re a stupid...\"\n I stop. In the mirror I spot a baby standing on the laundry basket, hands red with blood, eyes white, teeth glinting. It breathes out and a small cloud of red mist rises from its mouth.\n I shut my eyes and count to five, taking quick breaths, cursing myself for my weakness. When I look again, there\u0027s nobody behind me.\n I stomp from the bathroom and back to bed. I grab a fresh T-shirt from my wardrobe and glare as I pull it on, mad at myself for letting the nightmare freak me out so much.\n \"It was only a dream, B,\" I whisper as I lie beneath the covers, eyes wide, knowing I won\u0027t get a wink of sleep again tonight. \"Only a dream. Only a dream. Only a...\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-7.html","bookId":2450,"book":{"id":2450,"title":"Zom-B (Zom-B #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Zom-B (Zom-B #1) \n Zom-B is a radical new series about a zombie apocalypse, told in the first person by one of its victims. The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more. This is challenging material, which will captivate existing Shan fans and bring in many new ones. As Darren says, \"It\u0027s a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody. A high body-count is guaranteed!\"\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/zom-b-zom-b-1.jpg","author":"Darren Shan","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:23 PM"}}
