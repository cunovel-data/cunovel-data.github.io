{"id":80121,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Saturday drags. I stay in all day. A few of my mates call and ask me to come meet up, but I tell them I don\u0027t feel well. They say everyone\u0027s talking about me and how I rescued the baby. I laugh it off like it\u0027s no big deal. Dad takes us out to a Chinese restaurant for dinner. Mum dresses up and slaps makeup over her bruise. She and Dad share a couple of bottles of wine. He lets me have a sip when nobody\u0027s watching. Laughs when I grimace. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" he says. \"You\u0027ll get used to it.\" Dad\u0027s polite as he can be to the staff. Funny how he doesn\u0027t have a problem with foreigners when they\u0027re serving him food. Most of his favorite grub comes from overseas, Chinese, Italian, Indian. I consider pointing that out to him, but I don\u0027t want to set him off again. Mum and Dad head to the pub after the meal, leaving me to guard the fort at home. Dad gives me a fiver and tells me to treat myself to some chips and sweets. He scratches my head and grins. I grin back. The aggro of yesterday isn\u0027t forgotten by any of us, but we move on, the way we always do. No point living in the past. We\u0027d have burned out long ago if we held grudges. I watch a film, surf the Web, download some new tracks, play a few games, go to bed late. I don\u0027t hear the old pair come home. I get up about midday. Dad\u0027s still asleep. Mum\u0027s working on a Sunday roast. We\u0027re a bit stiff with each other. It always takes us a while to return to normal after Dad loses his temper. We\u0027re both embarrassed. We eat at two. Dad\u0027s hungover but he still manages to polish off his plate. He loves roasts, never leaves more than scraps. He drinks beer with the meal, saying that\u0027s the only way to combat a hangover. Normally he praises Mum\u0027s cooking but he doesn\u0027t say much today, nursing a headache. \"That was nice,\" I mutter as Mum clears up. \"I\u0027ve got dessert for later,\" Mum smiles. \"Pavlova. Your favorite.\" It\u0027s actually Dad\u0027s favorite, but I don\u0027t mind. We share a smile. Things are getting better. The air doesn\u0027t feel so tight around me now. Dad watches soccer in the afternoon. I watch some of the match with him. I make a few scathing comments about Premiership players and how they\u0027re overpaid prima donnas. That\u0027s usually guaranteed to set him off on an enthusiastic rant, but today he just grunts, wincing every now and then, rubbing his head as if that will make the pain go away. Some of Mum\u0027s friends come to visit. They don\u0027t say anything about her face, don\u0027t even ask if she had an accident. They start chirping about what happened at the War Museum but Mum shushes them before Dad kicks off again. They retreat to the kitchen and carry on in whispers. I go to my room when the soccer\u0027s over and phone Vinyl, hoping he won\u0027t have heard about the museum. No such luck. \"I hear you\u0027re London\u0027s newest superhero,\" he chuckles. \"Get stuffed.\" \"They should send you over to Ireland to stamp out the zombies.\" \"Don\u0027t make me come and give you a kicking,\" I warn him. He asks if I\u0027ve heard the latest rumors. Apparently Pallaskenry wasn\u0027t the first place the zombies struck. According to supposedly classified documents that have somehow surfaced on the Internet, there were at least three other attacks in small, out-of-the-way villages, one in Africa, two in South America. \"If that\u0027s true,\" Vinyl says, \"you can bet there\u0027s been even more of them in places we haven\u0027t heard of yet.\" \"It\u0027s all crap,\" I tell him. \"They\u0027re trying to scare us.\" \"Maybe,\" he hums. \"But it looks like the curfew\u0027s going ahead. They\u0027ve already introduced it in a lot of towns in Wales, since that\u0027s so close to Ireland. London nightlife\u0027s gonna be a thing of the past soon.\" \"That won\u0027t last,\" I snort. \"You think people here will stand for a lockdown? I give it a week or less. The rumors will die away, the curfew will be lifted, everything will go back to normal.\" \"I hope so,\" he sighs. We chat about TV and music. I tell Vinyl how Nancy confronted me at school, treating me like a racist. I get huffy about it, conveniently not mentioning the fact that I made gorilla noises. Vinyl isn\u0027t in the least sympathetic. \"Well, you are a racist,\" he notes. \"No I\u0027m not,\" I snap. \"I\u0027m talking to you, and you\u0027re hardly Snow White.\" \"I\u0027m your token black friend,\" he chuckles. \"No,\" I sniff. \"You\u0027re my token retarded friend.\" I hang up before he can yell at me. Giggling wickedly, delighted to have trumped him, I punch the air, then go take a long, hot bath. There\u0027s nothing like a good soak when it comes to relaxing. I lie in the tub for an hour, staring at the drops of condensation on the ceiling and window, feeling peaceful. The old scar on my thigh is itchy, so I scratch it, then turn on my side and let the air at it. When it stops annoying me, I lie flat again. Mum and I watch TV together later. Dad\u0027s gone out to the pub. Mum opens a box of chocolates and we share them. Belgian chocs. They\u0027re nice, but I prefer Roses or Quality Street. You can\u0027t beat a good Strawberry Cream. Dad gets back with a few of his mates not long after ten. My stomach tenses when they enter - I think Owl Man is going to be with them - but these are just some of his campaign buddies. They have posters and leaflets. Local elections aren\u0027t for another three or four months, but they\u0027ve been asked to start canvassing early. One of the posters has a picture of a zombie, set next to a photo of a Muslim bomber. WHICH DO YOU FEAR MOST? it asks. Dad and his mates love the poster. Mum and I pretend to admire it too. Then we go to bed early. Dad doesn\u0027t like us hanging around when he\u0027s talking shop. I\u0027m sure that I\u0027ll struggle to drop off, or have the nightmare again, but I don\u0027t. I\u0027m out in a minute and sleep the sleep of the dead after that.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-16.html","bookId":2450,"book":{"id":2450,"title":"Zom-B (Zom-B #1)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B (Zom-B #1) Zom-B is a radical new series about a zombie apocalypse, told in the first person by one of its victims. The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more. This is challenging material, which will captivate existing Shan fans and bring in many new ones. As Darren says, \"It\u0027s a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody. A high body-count is guaranteed!\"","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/zom-b-zom-b-1.jpg","author":"Darren Shan","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:23 PM"}}
