{"id":80126,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"We pause at the top of the stairs to get our bearings. The two zombies below are still tucking into the screaming Cass, and there are no others in sight.\n \"The exit\u0027s back that way,\" Stagger Lee pants.\n I\u0027m familiar with it. I used it once in a fire drill. If we can get through the door, it leads, via a set of steps, to the same alley as the other emergency exit.\n \"Maybe we should make for the front of the building,\" Trev says. \"We could jump from the windows.\"\n \"This exit\u0027s closer,\" Stagger Lee says.\n \"But if it\u0027s blocked...\" Seez mutters.\n \"We\u0027ve got to try,\" Stagger Lee insists. \"It\u0027s our best hope.\"\n \"Wait,\" Tyler says. It\u0027s the first time he\u0027s spoken since we broke out of the gym. \"The cafeteria\u0027s over there.\"\n \"You can\u0027t be hungry!\" I gasp.\n He shoots me a dirty look. \"They\u0027ve got knives in the kitchen. We can tool up.\"\n I frown. That\u0027s not a bad idea. \"What about it?\" I ask the group.\n \"Won\u0027t the cafeteria be full?\" Suze asks. \"It\u0027s lunch, so it will be like the gym. If the zombies have struck there, it\u0027ll be bedlam.\"\n \"But we\u0027ll have a much better chance if we have weapons,\" Ballydefeck says.\n \"It\u0027s worth a look,\" Elephant agrees.\n \"All right.\" I nod at Tyler. \"Lead the way.\"\n \"Me?\" he squeaks.\n I grin sharkishly. \"It was your idea. Only fair that if we get attacked, you should be first on their menu.\"\n It\u0027s hard to believe that I can make a joke at a time like this. But as awful as this is, as shocking as it\u0027s been, I can\u0027t shut down. At the moment I\u0027m alive. Those of us in this group have a chance to get out and fight another day. We have to cling to life as tightly as we can, put the atrocities from our thoughts, deal with this as if it were a surprise exam. What I\u0027ve learned today is that when the shit hits the fan, you can sit around and get splattered, or you can take it in your stride and do what you must to get away clean. I\u0027ll have nightmares about this later, maybe a full-on nervous breakdown, but only if I keep my cool and escape alive.\n We follow Tyler along the corridors. We\u0027re the only ones on the move up here, none of the chaos of downstairs. I have visions of walking into the cafeteria, everyone eating, unaware of what\u0027s happening below. Maybe they\u0027ll think we\u0027re winding them up. They might ignore our warnings and carry on with their lunch, oblivious until the zombies come crashing in on them.\n But when we get there, I immediately see that reality has struck just as hard in the cafeteria as it has downstairs. In fact, it\u0027s struck even harder.\n Students, along with some teachers and kitchen staff, are backed up against one of the walls. They\u0027re moaning and sobbing, but hardly any of them are fighting or trying to break free. They seem to have abandoned hope completely.\n They\u0027re surrounded by scores of zombies, maybe a hundred or more. They\u0027re picking off the living one by one, biting some to convert them, tearing into the brains of others. It\u0027s a carefully organized operation. And pulling the strings, directing the movements of the undead, is a small group of men and women in hoodies.\n My breath catches in my throat. We\u0027re watching from outside the cafeteria, through two round windows in the doors, taking turns to observe the horror show. But when my turn comes and I spot the people in the hoodies, I freeze and can\u0027t be torn away.\n There are several of them. Each has a whistle, which they blow every now and then to command attention. They have rotten skin, pockmarked with pustulant sores, purple in places, patches of flesh peeling away. All have gray, lifeless hair and pale yellow eyes. I can\u0027t see inside their mouths, but I\u0027m pretty sure that if I examined them close up, I\u0027d find shriveled, scabby tongues.\n They\u0027re the same type of creeps as the two guys at the Imperial War Museum, the mutants who tried to kidnap the baby. And they\u0027re clearly in control, dominating the zombies, using them to process the survivors neatly and efficiently.\n Seez was right. This isn\u0027t bad luck or a freak attack. We\u0027ve been set up. And even though I wouldn\u0027t have believed it was possible a minute ago, I feel even more fear now than I did when the zombies first burst into the gym. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-22.html","bookId":2450,"book":{"id":2450,"title":"Zom-B (Zom-B #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Zom-B (Zom-B #1) \n Zom-B is a radical new series about a zombie apocalypse, told in the first person by one of its victims. The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more. This is challenging material, which will captivate existing Shan fans and bring in many new ones. As Darren says, \"It\u0027s a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody. A high body-count is guaranteed!\"\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/zom-b-zom-b-1.jpg","author":"Darren Shan","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:23 PM"}}
