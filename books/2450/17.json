{"id":80122,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"I could do without school on Monday. I think about giving it a miss - wouldn\u0027t be the first time - but I don\u0027t fancy the idea of trudging around the streets by myself. If I\u0027d met up with my mates over the weekend, I could have arranged for a few of them to skip school with me. But it\u0027s too late to organize that now, so I decide to struggle through and maybe take tomorrow off instead. Everyone\u0027s still talking about the museum, the way I rescued the baby. Suze and La Lips shiver when they ask me to re-create it for them, eyes wide, wanting a tale of blood, treachery and heroism. \"It wasn\u0027t much,\" I mutter. \"The guys weren\u0027t that big.\" \"Rubbish,\" Kray says. \"I saw the one you tackled outside the shop. He was well over six foot. That knee put him down sweet though.\" Kray\u0027s not the only one living in awe of my trusty right knee. I reckon some of the fools would kneel down and kiss it if I gave them the chance. The praise goes to my head a bit but my mood doesn\u0027t lift. No matter how many times I\u0027m told that I\u0027m a hero, I can\u0027t forget about Dad, the contempt in his expression, the way he hit Mum and me. If ever there was a time to stand up to him and tell him I\u0027m not a racist, it was then. I could have said that I thought all babies were equal. Attacked him for being so heartless, so inhuman. Instead I just stood there, head low, saying nothing. As always. It\u0027s almost a relief to get to class. I can escape from the adulation there. We have biology first. I\u0027m worried that Mr. Burke might make a song and dance about what I did at the museum, but he\u0027s not in today, must be sick. Mrs. Reed takes our class instead. The morning rolls along drearily. I trudge from one class to the next, ignoring anyone who tries to talk with me about Friday, scribbling during lessons, paying little or no attention to the teachers. I meet up with some of the gang during the break and I\u0027m delighted when Elephant draws their attention away from me. \"I\u0027m playing soccer at lunch,\" he beams. \"Saw the doctor on Friday and she gave me the all-clear. Said it\u0027ll probably hurt for a few days, and not to tackle too hard, but I\u0027ve got the green light.\" Elephant\u0027s so excited, you\u0027d swear he was about to play in a cup final, not in a poxy five-a-side tournament. We slag him a bit but he laughs off our jeers, vowing to score a hat trick and come back bigger and better than ever. \"Bigger?\" La Lips says, batting her eyelids innocently. We all laugh, even the normally jealous Copper. Elephant makes us promise to come and cheer him on. I normally wouldn\u0027t bother with footie at lunch, but to keep Elephant happy, I agree to watch him make a fool of himself. \"Just don\u0027t elbow anybody,\" Suze warns him, \"or B will go for you.\" Elephant looks blank. He must be the only person not to have heard about the incident on Friday. Luckily, before I\u0027m forced to go through it again for his benefit, the bell rings and it\u0027s back to class. More pointless lessons, teachers droning on, trying to amuse myself by drawing crude cartoons and coming up with nicknames for the few of my friends who don\u0027t have any. Then lunch. I head to the gym with Copper, Kray, Suze, La Lips, Ballydefeck and Stagger Lee. We meet Pox, Trev and Linzer there. Elephant\u0027s warming up. Meths is on his team and the two of them hold a hushed conversation, discussing tactics. What a pair of clowns! Stuttering Stan is the ref. He blows his whistle and the teams take to the pitch. Other kids move out of their way and either line up along the sides to watch or go find somewhere else to hang out. The game kicks off and Elephant gets stuck straight in. If anyone expected him to take things easy in his first game back, they\u0027re instantly corrected as he goes into a tackle feetfirst and barges one of the other players over. Stuttering Stan blows for a free kick and gives Elephant a warning. Elephant rubs his leg and looks worried. As soon as Stuttering Stan\u0027s back is turned, he winks at Meths. I see now what they were cooking up - play the wounded soldier angle, use Stuttering Stan\u0027s sympathy to get away with as many dirty tackles as they can. \"Go on, Elephant!\" I roar as he chases the action. \"Do him!\" The others cheer along with me. The goalie pulls off a save and launches the ball up the field to Elephant. He turns, shoots and almost scores the goal of his life, but it flies just a few inches over. We\u0027re having a great time. For once I\u0027m immersed, keen to see who Elephant targets next, if he can cap his comeback with a goal, how much grimacing and sighing Stuttering Stan will stand for before he brandishes a yellow card. Then Tyler Bayor spoils it all. He comes up to me and gives my sleeve a tug. I glance at him suspiciously. He\u0027s never approached me like this before. I figure I must be in trouble, that he\u0027s delivering a message for someone. \"What do you want?\" I snap. Tyler grins shakily. \"I just wanted to say well done for the other day.\" I stare at him incredulously. The others are amazed too. He must have fallen out of bed and hit his head this morning. It\u0027s madness, tagging me like this, acting like we can be friends, like a compliment from him can make everything right between us. Who the hell does he reckon he is, Nelson bloody Mandela? \"Do you think I give a damn what you think of me?\" I snarl. Tyler\u0027s face creases and he gulps. \"No, B, of course not. I just wanted to - \" I poke him in the chest and he takes a quick step back. I follow and the gang closes around me, their focus switching from the game to the new, more highly charged action. \"Who gave you permission to breathe the same air as me?\" I sneer, poking Tyler again. \"Why are you doing this?\" he whines. \"I only wanted to tell you that I thought it was great, the way you saved that kid.\" \"I didn\u0027t do it to please the likes of you,\" I tell him. \"In fact, if I\u0027d known the baby was Indian, I\u0027d have let them take him.\" Snickers and theatrical gasps from the gang. They think I\u0027m joking, saying it to wind Tyler up. They don\u0027t know about what happened at home, how serious this is. If I let Tyler praise me, it\u0027ll be like I\u0027m taking his side against Dad. \"All right,\" Tyler sighs. \"I\u0027m sorry. I won\u0027t congratulate you again.\" He turns to leave. I grab his arm and swing him back to face me. \"You\u0027re not going anywhere.\" I poke his chest a third time. \"You started this. Let\u0027s take it all the way.\" Tyler\u0027s eyes fill with panic. I\u0027ve given him a rough ride over the years, but I\u0027ve never gone all out for him. He\u0027s small. I don\u0027t usually pick fights with no-hopers. I go for opponents who stand a chance, who are worth beating. Tyler isn\u0027t a fighter. He probably thought he\u0027d never get called out by me. But he rubbed me the wrong way at the wrong time. I know it\u0027s unfair. It\u0027s my dad I should be squaring up to, not a wimp like Tyler. Or, if not Dad, then one of Tyler\u0027s bigger buddies, someone who could give as good as he gets. But I can\u0027t help myself. I\u0027ve been bottling in my anger all weekend. I have to lash out at someone, and Tyler\u0027s placed himself in my line of fire. \"Easy, B,\" Trev mutters, seeing something dark flash across my face. \"You want some of this too?\" I bark. He shakes his head and goes quiet. I focus on Tyler again. I\u0027m snarling like a dog. Tyler looks like he\u0027s about to faint. Before he passes out, I slap him, the way his mate Nancy slapped me when I made the gorilla noises. \"Come on,\" I hiss. \"Show me what you\u0027ve got.\" \"I don\u0027t want to fight,\" Tyler says, backing up. \"Too bad.\" I slap him again. \"Give me your best shot.\" \"No,\" he squeals. \"I don\u0027t want to.\" I make a fist and jab him in the stomach. It\u0027s not a hard punch, just a taste of things to come. But he doubles over, then drops to his knees and starts crying, hugging himself as if I\u0027d swung a cricket bat into his ribs. I stare at Tyler uncertainly. I\u0027m not used to this sort of a reaction. It throws me. The others are looking away, clearing their throats, disgusted and embarrassed at the same time. This is doing more harm to my image than to Tyler\u0027s. Everyone knows he\u0027s soft. But for me to pick a fight with a harmless crybaby... \"Forget about him,\" I snap, turning my back on Tyler and looking for another target. I spot a group of Muslim kids standing in a huddle, unaware of any of this, sharing a joke. They\u0027re from the year above ours, big buggers, well able to fight their own corner. \"Let\u0027s do those bastards,\" I snarl, looking to my gang for support. Nobody responds. They\u0027re startled by my sudden mood swing, my thirst for a fight. They\u0027ve seen me fired up before, but not like this. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I sneer. \"Frightened?\" \"Of course not,\" Kray says. \"But why don\u0027t we leave it and have a go at them after school instead? We\u0027ll get in trouble if we attack them here.\" He\u0027s right but I can\u0027t pull back now. \"Okay, cowards,\" I spit. \"I\u0027ll do the sods myself.\" I start towards the group. I don\u0027t know if the others will follow once they see that I\u0027m serious. I\u0027ll get hammered to a pulp if they don\u0027t - without backup I won\u0027t stand a chance. But I don\u0027t care. Let them kick the crap out of me. At least I\u0027ll be able to go home to Dad and be sure of a warm welcome. He\u0027ll make me a cup of tea, rub my head, tell me I\u0027m one of his own. He might criticize me for picking a fight I couldn\u0027t win, and tell me I have to be savvier. But he\u0027ll be proud of me. He\u0027ll love my fighting spirit. He\u0027ll love me. And right now that\u0027s all in the world that matters. But I haven\u0027t taken more than three steps when everything goes to hell and all natural fights are forgotten. Screams ring out loud over the other noises. Everyone stops and stares at the main doors into the gym. They\u0027re hanging open and we can see the corridor beyond. The screams get louder. My eyes widen and my heart beats fast. I instinctively know what this means but I can\u0027t admit it. Nobody can. That\u0027s why we stand like a bunch of dummies, doing nothing. A boy staggers into the gym. He\u0027s bleeding. Terrified. Moaning. He falls and I see that a chunk has been cut - bitten - out of the back of his neck. Blood spurts from the wound. As we gape, more kids spill into the gym. All screaming. Some bleeding. Everyone in shock. One of the girls looks wild-eyed at the rest of us, as if just noticing we\u0027re there. Gazes at us in horrified silence. Then shrieks hysterically - \"Zombies!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-17.html","bookId":2450,"book":{"id":2450,"title":"Zom-B (Zom-B #1)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B (Zom-B #1) Zom-B is a radical new series about a zombie apocalypse, told in the first person by one of its victims. The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more. This is challenging material, which will captivate existing Shan fans and bring in many new ones. As Darren says, \"It\u0027s a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody.
