{"id":80115,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Biology. One of the few classes where I pay attention. Not because I\u0027m fascinated by the digestive system of the worm (give me strength!) but because I like the teacher, Mr. Burke.\\n\\n Burke impressed me the first day he walked into class and said, \"I know most of you couldn\u0027t give a toss about biology, but if you don\u0027t give me any grief, I\u0027ll do my best to make it interesting for you.\"\\n\\n Burke\u0027s the best of our teachers, maybe the only really good one that we have. I don\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing in this dump. He should be at a good school like the one Vinyl moved to. He\u0027s wasted here, stuck with mugs like Meths and Kray and... yeah, I can admit it... me.\\n\\n Dad doesn\u0027t share my high opinion of Mr. Burke and has tried a few times to have him drummed out, or at least confined to teaching kids of his own race. Which is odd, because the lightly colored Burke is of a mixed background. I would have thought that meant he could claim membership to either side, but Dad doesn\u0027t see it that way. He moans about Burke all the time and I nod like the obedient little puppy that I am and simper, \"Yes, Dad. No, Dad. Three bags full, Dad.\" It sickens me but what can I do? If I told him Burke\u0027s a cool teacher, he\u0027d hammer me. Easier to say nothing and keep my head down.\\n\\n Burke is trying hard to make the dissection of a worm seem like an earth-shattering event but it\u0027s hard to keep us interested in crap like this. After a while Trev puts up a hand. \"Sir?\"\\n\\n \"Go on,\" Burke sighs, looking up from the worm with an expression that seems to suggest he finds this particular lesson as boring as the rest of us.\\n\\n \"Can we dissect a zombie next, sir?\"\\n\\n Laughter.\\n\\n \"If you bring me one, I\u0027ll certainly help you cut it up,\" Burke says drily, then pushes the worm aside. I grin at Trev and give him a cheesy thumbs-up. It\u0027s great when we sidetrack Burke. He doesn\u0027t let it happen often - he insists on covering the course inside out - but every now and then he\u0027ll relent.\\n\\n \"Who believes that zombies are real?\" Burke asks.\\n\\n A few hands go up, but not many. It\u0027s not that we don\u0027t believe, just that we don\u0027t want to be seen to be enthusiastic in class.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" Burke snaps. \"A real show of hands or it\u0027s back to the worm.\"\\n\\n We groan, then hands start creeping up. Soon most of them are in the air.\\n\\n Burke does a slow count, then says softly, \"Why?\"\\n\\n We gape at him.\\n\\n \"Why?\" he says again. \"Because they\u0027re on TV? Because you\u0027ve seen photos and video clips?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" someone says.\\n\\n \"But they can do anything with digital equipment these days, can\u0027t they?\" he smirks.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you believe, sir?\" I ask. I was one of the few to keep their hand down.\\n\\n \"Actually, I do,\" he says. \"But let\u0027s explore alternatives.\" He turns to the whiteboard, grabs a pen and writes Media hoax? Publicity for a film or TV show? then looks over his shoulder at us. \"Any other ideas?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a conspiracy,\" Stagger Lee snorts.\\n\\n \"The government?\" Burke asks.\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"The Irish? Ours? America\u0027s?\"\\n\\n Stagger Lee shrugs. \"The whole bloody lot.\"\\n\\n \"What for?\" Burke asks. \"Why go to all that trouble?\"\\n\\n Silence for a moment, then Linzer - one of the smartest in our year - puts up her hand and says, \"Experiment gone wrong.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" Burke beams and adds it to the whiteboard. \"What sort of experiment?\"\\n\\n \"Chemical weapons,\" Linzer says. \"Maybe they were testing something and it accidentally got into the water or air. Or they released it on purpose.\"\\n\\n \"Which is more likely?\" Burke asks, nodding at Elephant.\\n\\n \"Dunno,\" Elephant says.\\n\\n \"B?\"\\n\\n \"A test,\" I say confidently.\\n\\n \"Why?\" he presses.\\n\\n \"Pallaskenry\u0027s in the middle of nowhere. They wouldn\u0027t have any labs around there. It\u0027s all bog land.\"\\n\\n \"Excellent, B.\"\\n\\n I find myself grinning goofily. Nobody has a dig at me to bring me down to size either, like they would if this was any other class.\\n\\n \"More ideas,\" Burke says, pointing to Suze.\\n\\n \"God, I don\u0027t know.\" She blushes, then coughs. \"My dad thinks it\u0027s terrorists.\"\\n\\n Burke blinks. \"Come again?\"\\n\\n \"He thinks the army went in looking for terrorists. Got carried away and killed civilians by mistake. Then cooked up this zombie story to give them an excuse to kill the witnesses.\"\\n\\n \"Far-fetched,\" Burke hums, \"but let\u0027s run with it.\" He adds the theory to the board and asks for more suggestions.\\n\\n Someone thinks the zombies are robots gone wild. Another says maybe it\u0027s aliens, that the rabid crazies were taken over by bodiless beings from another planet. Kray comes up with a twist on the experiment angle, only he figures people are being controlled by satellite signals.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re gonna use it on the Arabs,\" he says. \"No more sending our troops in to sort out their messes. Drive the buggers mad and leave them to it. They\u0027ll wipe themselves out, and good riddance to them.\"\\n\\n The Muslim kids don\u0027t like that. Angry mutterings. Burke shushes them.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not one of the more far-fetched ideas,\" he says. \"Certain politicians would do just about anything to cling to power and disable our enemies. Kray was insulting - grow up and stop acting like a thug - but he might have a point.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s terrifying,\" I snort, evil-eyeing the Muslims. \"In fact I hope Kray\u0027s right, that we are going after them. They\u0027d do it to us if they could.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have that argument another day,\" Burke barks, stopping a war before it can erupt. \"Let\u0027s stick to zombies. Any other proposals?\"\\n\\n There are a few more, then Burke stands back to study what he\u0027s written. \"It\u0027s a horrible world, isn\u0027t it?\" he mutters and I\u0027m not sure he knows that he\u0027s spoken out loud.\\n\\n He turns to us. \"I\u0027m not saying I believe any of these exotic, unfounded theories. But these are questions we should be asking. Life\u0027s complicated. Answers rarely come wrapped up nice and simple. There are plenty of people out there ready to tell us what we should and shouldn\u0027t believe. We always need to be skeptical, to look for the sting in the tale.\"\\n\\n Burke looks around slowly and it seems like he\u0027s staring at each and every one of us in turn. \"Trust no one. Always question what you\u0027re told. Don\u0027t believe the lies that people feed you, even if they\u0027re your teachers or parents. At the end of the day you have to work out for yourself what\u0027s right or wrong.\"\\n\\n He glances back at the board and sighs. \"But bear in mind. There are lots of black-hearted, mean-spirited bastards in the world.\" There are some gasps when he swears but most of us take no notice. \"It\u0027s important that we hold them to account. But always remember that you might be the most black-hearted and mean-spirited of the lot, so hold yourself the most accountable of all.\"\\n\\n As we try to make sense of that, Burke chuckles, shakes his head and wipes the board clean. \"Enough preaching,\" he says brightly, then adds, to a chorus of groans, \"Back to the worm...\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-9.html","bookId":2450,"book":{"id":2450,"title":"Zom-B (Zom-B #1)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B (Zom-B #1) \\n Zom-B is a radical new series about a zombie apocalypse, told in the first person by one of its victims. The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more.

As Darren says, \"It\u0027s a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody.
