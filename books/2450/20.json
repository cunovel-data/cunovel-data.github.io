{"id":100936,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"We don\u0027t get very far. This corridor stretches along the side of the gym. We hurry to the end of it and start down the next passageway, off of which lie a series of classrooms. But we\u0027re less than a quarter of the way along when we hear a mob racing towards us, screaming and wailing. \"They must be heading for the exit or the gym,\" Stagger Lee says. \"They\u0027ll be on us in a sec,\" Copper mutters. \"We have to tell them to go back,\" Suze pants. \"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" I snarl. \"They\u0027re being chased. They won\u0027t stop and listen calmly.\" \"We won\u0027t get through them,\" Cass says. \"Even if we do, zombies must be right behind,\" Copper says. There\u0027s a door to my left. I open it and glance into a small classroom for younger kids. It\u0027s empty. \"In here,\" I decide. \"We\u0027ll hide, wait for them to pass, then sneak out.\" \"What if the zombies smell us?\" Cass asks. I shrug. \"It\u0027s a gamble one way or the other.\" The first few kids of the mob surge into the hallway. Zombies are among them, snapping, tearing, maiming, killing. \"In!\" I bark and everyone pushes into the room after me, no complaints. When we\u0027re all inside, I slam the door shut. There\u0027s no key, of course. \"We need to barricade it,\" I shout, but some of the others are ahead of me. Copper and Ballydefeck arrive seconds later with a desk each, which they prop against the door. More furniture is added to the pile and moments later there\u0027s a mountain of desks and chairs between us and the door. \"Won\u0027t do much good if they come through the windows,\" Trev says, nodding at the frosted glass on either side of the door. \"They can\u0027t see us through the glass,\" I mutter, stepping back. \"And if we keep quiet, they can\u0027t hear us either.\" \"What about smell?\" Cass asks. I frown. \"What is it with you and zombies smelling us?\" \"I\u0027ve seen movies where they can sniff out the living,\" he says. \"Well, let\u0027s hope they all had really bad colds when they were turned,\" I growl and we all squat quietly. Screams in the corridor. Sounds of fighting. Someone slams into the glass and it rattles. At first I think it\u0027s a zombie trying to break through, but it must have just been someone crashing into it, because there aren\u0027t any more assaults on the window. \"Please don\u0027t eat me!\" I hear a kid beg. \"Please don\u0027t eat me! Please don\u0027t - \" A high-pitched shriek. I shut my eyes and feel tears build behind my eyelids. This can\u0027t be happening. Zombies aren\u0027t real. Pallaskenry was a joke. We were so sneery, laughing about it in class, coming up with alternative theories. I must be dreaming. Babies will come crawling over the desks any minute now, calling me their mummy, and I\u0027ll know it\u0027s a nightmare. But that\u0027s wishful thinking. This is reality. I always know when I\u0027m having a dream. No matter how real it seems at the time, it never feels completely real. This does. I open my eyes and look around. Everyone\u0027s shaking and either crying or close to it. La Lips is clinging to Copper, weeping as he whispers soothing words in her ear. Linzer\u0027s praying. She\u0027s not the only one - Dunglop, Tyler, Ballydefeck and two of the Muslims are also openly praying. I figure some of the others are too, but privately. Pox is squatting a couple of feet away from the rest of us, weeping over his wounds, shaking his head, muttering something under his breath. Cass is keeping an eye on him, flick knife open and glinting, ready to leap on Pox at the first sign that he\u0027s turning into a zombie. \"You know the worst thing about this?\" Elephant whispers. When a few of us stare at him, he says glumly, \"It ruined my comeback.\" I stifle a giggle. \"Idiot!\" I snort. \"You were crap anyway,\" Meths says. \"Was not,\" Elephant growls. \"We need a plan,\" Trev says, and we look at him expectantly. \"We can\u0027t just go charging about the place.\" \"So what should we do?\" Cass asks. \"Stay here,\" Trev says. \"Keep our heads down. Wait for the police to find us.\" \"But in Pallaskenry - \" Copper starts to object. \"This isn\u0027t Pallaskenry,\" Trev snaps. \"It\u0027s a school. They\u0027re not going to stand by and let soldiers kill a load of kids. There\u0027d be riots if they did. They\u0027ll come as soon as they can, flush out the place, protect the survivors. If we can stay hidden for an hour or two, that\u0027s all we\u0027ll need. Maybe less.\" We consider Trev\u0027s plan. \"If police and soldiers raid the school,\" Linzer says, \"we\u0027d be safer here than out there. They shot anyone who moved in Ireland. They won\u0027t know who\u0027s a zombie and who isn\u0027t, and they won\u0027t want to take chances.\" \"It\u0027ll be a free-for-all,\" Copper agrees. \"But if the zombies find us first...\" Stagger Lee mutters. \"I say we make a break for it. Head for the stairs, get to the floor above, find the exit, let ourselves out, don\u0027t look back.\" \"What if that door\u0027s shut too?\" one of the Muslim boys asks. \"It won\u0027t be,\" Stagger Lee says. \"The one by the gym was,\" the Muslim reminds him. \"That was bad luck,\" Stagger Lee says. \"There\u0027s no chance that two of the exits will be jammed at the same time.\" \"Who says it was luck?\" the Muslim asks. \"Am I the only one who thinks this is too much of a coincidence? The janitors check those doors regularly - they have to be sure they\u0027re working, in case of a fire. And on the very day we need them, one just happens to be stuck? I don\u0027t buy it.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Trev snaps. \"Someone sealed it shut,\" the Muslim says. \"We\u0027ve been locked in.\" A scary silence settles over us. I find myself looking at Cass, and he looks back at me. His eyes are wider with fear than they were a minute ago. \"What\u0027s your name?\" I ask the Muslim. \"Seez,\" he says. \"Seez, do us all a favor and shut up,\" I tell him. \"Why?\" he scowls. \"If you\u0027re right, we\u0027re screwed,\" I say evenly. \"So let\u0027s not think about it, and keep our fingers crossed that you\u0027re wrong.\" \"But - \" \"If we\u0027re locked in here with a pack of rotten zombies, what good will worrying about it do us?\" I challenge him. \"We can come up with a plan,\" he says. I laugh bitterly. \"If someone\u0027s blocked all the exits, there\u0027s no plan, we\u0027re done for. We have to believe that the door back there was a one-off. If it wasn\u0027t, we\u0027ll find out soon enough, and we won\u0027t have to worry about it for long.\" Seez stares at me, then nods reluctantly. \"So what do we do?\" I ask. \"Hole up or try for the exits? Let\u0027s vote. Who wants to stay?\" Everyone looks around, hesitant to be the first to vote. Then Linzer sticks up her hand. A few more start to rise. But before a decision can be made, Pox groans, turns aside and vomits. \"Gross,\" Dunglop chuckles - he\u0027s closest to Pox. There\u0027s a strange creaking sound, like a plank being bent to snapping point. As I\u0027m trying to place it, Pox shudders, then falls still. The noise comes again. Cass takes a cautious step towards the motionless Pox, rolling his knife lightly between his fingers. \"Everyone stay back,\" Cass says. \"I\u0027m gonna make sure - \" Pox lurches to his feet, leaps at Dunglop and bites a chunk of flesh out of his cheek. Dunglop screams and staggers into Cass, knocking him aside. Pox is already moving. He scrabbles after Rick, the kid from a lower year, and grabs his foot. Rick kicks out but Pox bites into his ankle. As Rick screams, Pox turns on Suze and goes for her throat. Cass gets in the way and jabs at Pox with his knife. Pox lowers his head and charges. I tackle him before he connects with Cass. Drive him sideways. He crashes into a desk and goes sprawling. \"Clear the bloody door!\" I roar. As the others hurry to the piled-up desks and chairs, I face Pox, who\u0027s back on his feet, snarling. There\u0027s a strange green fungus growing over the places where he was bitten by the zombie. Only thin wisps, but I note their presence like some supersleuth with a keen eye for detail. And his fingernails are longer than they were. No... hold on... those aren\u0027t nails. Bits of bone are sticking out of each finger, scraps of flesh and nails shedding from them. I recall the creaking noise and put two and two together. The bones must have lengthened and snapped through his flesh as he was changing. I glance down and spot bones sticking through the tips of his shoes too. Pox closes in on me but is distracted when Cass whistles. \"Here, boy,\" Cass growls, beckoning Pox on. \"Come and get it.\" Pox scowls and goes after Cass, moving speedily. Cass stabs at him. The blade sinks deep into Pox\u0027s chest. It pierces his heart, but that doesn\u0027t matter to Pox. He pushes on and Cass goes down. Pox opens his jaws and snaps at Cass\u0027s face. His teeth are longer and thicker than I remember. One of the Muslims grabs Pox before he can bite. Pulls him off of Cass and pushes him away. Pox falls, but one of his bony nails scratches the Muslim\u0027s chin and draws blood. \"We\u0027re out of here!\" Trev shouts, and I see that the door is open. Everyone\u0027s spilling into the corridor. Meths is dragging Rick, and Dunglop is stumbling after the others. \"Let me help you,\" I pant, taking Dunglop\u0027s arm. \"Thanks,\" he moans, holding a hand to his bitten cheek. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I whisper, then whirl swiftly and send Dunglop flying across the room. He smashes into Pox, who goes down again and starts biting instinctively. \"What the hell!\" Trev shouts. \"Meths!\" I bark. \"Leave him.\" Meths looks at me uncertainly. \"They were bitten,\" I growl. \"The same thing that happened to Pox will happen to them.\" \"No!\" Rick screams. \"Don\u0027t leave me! I won\u0027t change! You can\u0027t just - \" \"B\u0027s right,\" Copper says. \"Look,\" La Lips groans, pointing. Pox is tucking into Dunglop\u0027s brain. He\u0027s broken through the skull with the bones sticking out of his fingers and is gorging himself on the juicy stuff inside, like a pig chowing down. Dunglop\u0027s still alive, shivering, eyelids flickering with terror and shock. But he doesn\u0027t scream. Just spasms. Meths drops Rick and backs away from him. When Rick tries to crawl after him, Meths kicks him in the head and the boy collapses with a whine. Seez is staring at the scratched Muslim, who wipes drops of blood from his chin, studies them and sighs. \"A scratch might not be the same as a bite,\" he says. \"But we can\u0027t take that chance,\" Seez says quietly. The Muslim sighs again. \"I\u0027ll head for the front door. If I make it, and if I don\u0027t turn, I\u0027ll try to get help for the rest of you.\" He darts through the doorway and is gone before Seez can say anything. I glance at Pox and Dunglop one last time, my stomach turning, tears dripping down my cheeks. Then I curse hatefully and rush out after the others, leaving my dead and undead friends behind.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-20.html","bookId":2450,"book":{"id":2450,"title":"Zom-B (Zom-B #1)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B (Zom-B #1) Zom-B is a radical new series about a zombie apocalypse, told in the first person by one of its victims. The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more. This is challenging material, which will captivate existing Shan fans and bring in many new ones. As Darren says, \"It\u0027s a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody.
