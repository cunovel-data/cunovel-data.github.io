{"id":80120,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"I\u0027m hailed as a hero by the baby\u0027s mother. She hugs me and thanks me through her sobs, saying I\u0027m wonderful, I saved her child, I should get a reward. Strangers look on and beam. Guards and staff from the museum congratulate me. My mates from school watch, astonished. Burke is smiling. He winks when I catch his eye.\\n\\n The guards try to get descriptions of the men from me. I tell them I didn\u0027t see much, that they didn\u0027t let their hoods drop. I don\u0027t tell them about the odd skin, the yellow eyes, that they looked like mutants. I\u0027d sound like a lunatic if I did.\\n\\n I shrug off the compliments on the Tube back to school, scowling and saying nothing. Burke tells the others to leave me alone and I sit in silence, listening to the rumblings of the train, staring out of the window at the darkness of the tunnels, unable to forget the men\u0027s lips, their skin, those eyes. If I did imagine all that, I have a more vivid imagination than I ever gave myself credit for.\\n\\n Back at school, Burke asks if I\u0027m all right. When he sees that I\u0027m not, he offers to take me home early. I don\u0027t want any special treatment, so I tell him I\u0027d rather stay and I sit in an empty classroom for the rest of the afternoon. Burke and Mrs. Reed pop in to see me a few times - Mrs. Reed says I\u0027ve done the school proud - but otherwise I\u0027m alone with my thoughts. And if I could get away from them, I would.\\n\\n The minutes drag but eventually pass and I slip out of school ahead of the bell, so as not to have to face my friends. I feel strange, like I\u0027ve been violently sick. I just want to go home, rest up, stay in for the weekend, and hopefully return in better form on Monday.\\n\\n Mum has already heard about the incident at the museum when I get back. She squeals when I walk in and calls me her little hero. Hugs and coos over me, asks if I want anything special for dinner. I grin weakly and tell her I don\u0027t have much of an appetite, I\u0027ll just have whatever she\u0027s having.\\n\\n She wants me to tell her all about it, the kidnapping, the rescue, how I stood up to two grown men. I try to shrug it off but she keeps on and on about it. Eventually I give in and start talking. I hold back the bit about how the men looked. I don\u0027t plan on telling anyone about that.\\n\\n Dad gets home before I\u0027m finished. He\u0027s grinning when he comes in and sees us chatting - he thinks we\u0027re gossiping. When Mum starts to tell him what happened, he frowns, tells her to shut up and makes me go through it again from the start.\\n\\n Mum serves up dinner - fish and chips, usually my favorite, but they taste like cardboard in my current state. She keeps saying how brave I was, how she\u0027s proud of me, how the staff at the museum shouldn\u0027t have let me face a pair of dangerous criminals by myself.\\n\\n Dad doesn\u0027t say much. He\u0027s got a face on him, the sort of scowl I know all too well. He\u0027s brooding about something. Mum\u0027s so excited, she doesn\u0027t notice it, but I do and I keep my trap shut, not wanting to wind him up any further. It\u0027s best to say as little as possible when he\u0027s in a mood like this.\\n\\n It finally comes out when we\u0027re watching TV after dinner. Mum\u0027s still babbling about the baby and how I should get a medal. Dad sighs irritably and says, \"I wish you\u0027d drop it, Daisy.\"\\n\\n \"But aren\u0027t you proud, Todd?\" Mum replies, surprised.\\n\\n Dad grunts and shoots me a dirty look. I act as if I\u0027m fascinated by the chef who\u0027s showing us how to cook a meal for six people in less than thirty minutes.\\n\\n \"Of course I\u0027m pleased that you stood up for yourself,\" he says to me. \"But...\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Mum huffs when he doesn\u0027t go on. I groan. Why doesn\u0027t she know when to keep quiet?\\n\\n \"They were Indian,\" Dad says softly, and I look around. I didn\u0027t know what was gnawing at him before. Now it becomes clear.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that got to do with anything?\" Mum asks, bewildered.\\n\\n \"We\u0027d be better off if they took a dozen little Indians and dumped them in the Thames.\" Dad laughs, like he\u0027s only joking, but I know he\u0027s genuinely angry.\\n\\n Mum frowns. \"Don\u0027t say things like that, Todd. It\u0027s not funny. It\u0027s not the poor baby\u0027s fault it\u0027s Indian.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not mine either, is it?\" Dad snaps. He glares at Mum, then looks at me and grimaces. \"I like that you tried to help, but if it had been an English kid...\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s outrageous,\" Mum says frostily. \"Babies are innocent. Would you have left the child to those two beasts?\"\\n\\n \"Nobody\u0027s innocent,\" Dad says. \"It\u0027s us against them. Always has been, always will be. If we start fighting their battles for them, where will it stop? Do we let them stay because they have cute babies? Keep on giving them benefits, so they can spit out more of the buggers, until they have enough to out-vote us? Babies grow up. They infest good schools and ruin them. They buy houses and destroy neighborhoods. They import drugs and sell them to our kids. They blow things up.\\n\\n \"They were all babies once,\" Dad says. \"Every last terrorist and job-stealing scab was like that boy in the museum. We can\u0027t be soft. We can\u0027t give ground. Ever.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wrong,\" Mum says, and I think Dad\u0027s even more amazed than I am. She\u0027s never spoken to him like this before. I wouldn\u0027t have thought that she could. \"There are bad people in the world, Todd, white as well as colored. We can\u0027t let people steal babies. We\u0027d be cruel if we - \"\\n\\n Dad\u0027s hand shoots up and he slaps her, hard. Her head cracks back and she cries out. He grabs her throat and squeezes. His eyes are wild. I throw myself at him, roaring at him to stop. He hits me with his free hand, slaps me even harder than he slapped Mum. I\u0027m knocked to the floor by the force of the blow, but Dad barely notices. He\u0027s fully fixed on Mum.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t ever talk to me that way,\" Dad snarls. \"I won\u0027t have you turn on me. If you ever stick up for those bastards again, I\u0027ll kill you. You hear me, woman? Do. You. Bloody. Well. Hear. Me?\"\\n\\n He shakes her with every word. Mum makes a choking noise and tries to nod. Her fingers scratch at his arms. For a moment I think he\u0027s gonna finish her off, that this is how it will end. All these years, all the beatings, all leading to this. I push myself to my feet, ready to lunge at him again, desperate to stop him, to save Mum, to escape with her before he can make good on his threat.\\n\\n But then Dad\u0027s fingers relax and withdraw. He clutches Mum\u0027s chin and gives her the evil eyeball. She\u0027s weeping. Her nose is bleeding. The flesh under her left eye is already starting to puff up. Dad wipes blood from her lip and smiles tightly.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be all right,\" he says as if she\u0027d just tripped and hurt herself. \"Go make us all a cuppa. Have a cig out back. You\u0027ll be fine when you come in. Won\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Mum gasps repeatedly like a dying fish. Dad\u0027s fingers clench.\\n\\n \"Won\u0027t you?\" he barks, sharper this time, wanting to hear an answer.\\n\\n \"Yes... Todd,\" Mum wheezes.\\n\\n Dad releases her. She gets up and stumbles to the kitchen, trying not to sob, knowing that if she makes too much noise it will infuriate him and maybe set him off again.\\n\\n Dad looks at me and I wait for him to follow up his first blow. If he lays into me, I\u0027ll just stand here and let him beat me. It\u0027s the best thing to do. He loses his head completely if I fight back. I don\u0027t mind the beatings, the pain. As long as Mum\u0027s out of the way and safe, he can hit me as hard as he likes.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll say this, though,\" Dad says slowly, then pauses, letting me know that he could swing either way right now, that he can laugh this off or come down hard on me, that he has the power, that me and Mum are his to control. \"I wish I\u0027d been there to see you knee that sod.\"\\n\\n We both laugh, Dad loudly, me weakly. He switches channels to a quiz show, gets a few answers right and chuckles proudly, delighted with himself. Mum brings the tea and he pats her bum as she places it before him. She smiles crookedly, sits by his side and kisses the hand he struck her with.\\n\\n Later, in my room, sitting up in bed, listening to tunes on my iPod. Crying. I hate tears but tonight I can\u0027t hold them back. I\u0027m not in much pain - the slap didn\u0027t even leave a mark - but inside I feel wretched.\\n\\n I don\u0027t want to blame Dad for what he did. I make excuses for him, the way I always do. Mum shouldn\u0027t have challenged him. She knows what he\u0027s like. She should have read his mood and...\\n\\n No. I can\u0027t put the blame on her. I was wrong too. I shouldn\u0027t have risked my neck for an Indian kid. I should have left the baby to the mutants. One less for us to kick out of the country. Dad was right. He was trying to help us see the world the way it really is. We should have listened. It wasn\u0027t his fault. I shouldn\u0027t have saved the baby. Mum should have kept her mouth shut.\\n\\n I tell myself that over and over. I make every excuse for him that I can. And I try to believe. I try so bloody hard to justify his actions, because he\u0027s my dad and I love him. But deep down I know it\u0027s a load of bull.\\n\\n When I\u0027m crying so hard that I\u0027m making moaning sounds, I channel the music through my speakers so that Dad won\u0027t hear. Then I weep harder, fingers balled into fists, face scrunched up with hate and confusion.\\n\\n He\u0027s a bully. A wife beater. A racist. A hateful, nasty sod. I want to hang him up by his thumbs. Sneer at him as he writhes in agony. Ask him if he\u0027s proud of himself now, if he still thinks it\u0027s all right to beat up a woman and child.\\n\\n Then I despise myself for thinking such a terrible thing. He wants what\u0027s best for us. He\u0027s trying to help, doing all that he can to steer us the right way. He only hits us when we let him down. We have to try harder. We...\\n\\n \"I hate him,\" I moan, burying my face in my hands.\\n\\n But he\u0027s my dad.\\n\\n \"I hate him.\"\\n\\n But he\u0027s my dad.\\n\\n \"I hate him.\"\\n\\n But... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-15.html","bookId":2450,"book":{"id":2450,"title":"Zom-B (Zom-B #1)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B (Zom-B #1) \\n Zom-B is a radical new series about a zombie apocalypse, told in the first person by one of its victims. The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more. This is challenging material, which will captivate existing Shan fans and bring in many new ones. As Darren says, \"It\u0027s a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody.
