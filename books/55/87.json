{"id":1695,"no":87,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 21","content":"And then witnesses, witnesses, witnesses--to the number of one hundred and twenty-seven. And their testimony,particularly that of the doctors, three guides, the woman who heard Roberta\u0027s last cry, all repeatedly objected toby Jephson and Belknap, for upon such weakness and demonstrable error as they could point out depended theplausibility of Clyde\u0027s daring defense. And all of this carrying the case well into November, and after Mason hadbeen overwhelmingly elected to the judgeship which he had so craved. And because of the very vigor and strifeof the trial, the general public from coast to coast taking more and more interest. And obviously, as the dayspassed and the newspaper writers at the trial saw it, Clyde was guilty. Yet he, because of the repeated commandsof Jephson, facing each witness who assailed him with calm and even daring.\n 　　\"Your name?\"\"Titus Alden.\"\"You are the father of Roberta Alden?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"Now, Mr. Alden, just tell the jury how and under what circumstances it was that your daughter Robertahappened to go to Lycurgus.\"\"Objected to. Irrelevant, immaterial, incompetent,\" snapped Belknap.\n 　　\"I\u0027ll connect it up,\" put in Mason, looking up at the judge, who ruled that Titus might answer subject to a motionto strike out his testimony if not \"connected up.\"\"She went there to get work,\" replied Titus.\n 　　\"And why did she go there to get work?\"Again objection, and the old man allowed to proceed after the legal formalities had again been complied with.\n 　　\"Well, the farm we have over there near Biltz hasn\u0027t ever paid so very well, and it\u0027s been necessary for thechildren to help out and Bobbie being the oldest--\"\"Move to strike out!\" \"Strike it out.\"\"\u0027Bobbie\u0027 was the pet name you gave your daughter Roberta, was it?\"\"Objected to,\" etc., etc. \"Exception.\"\"Yes, sir. \u0027Bobbie\u0027 was what we sometimes called her around there-- just Bobbie.\"And Clyde listening intently and enduring without flinching the stern and accusing stare of this brooding Priamof the farm, wondering at the revelation of his former sweetheart\u0027s pet name. He had nicknamed her \"Bert\"; shehad never told him that at home she was called \"Bobbie.\"And amid a fusillade of objections and arguments and rulings, Alden continuing, under the leading of Mason, torecite how she had decided to go to Lycurgus, after receipt of a letter from Grace Marr, and stop with Mr. andMrs. Newton. And after securing work with the Griffiths Company, how little the family had seen of her untilJune fifth last, when she had returned to the farm for a rest and in order to make some clothes.\n 　　\"No announcement of any plans for marriage?\"\"None.\"But she had written a number of long letters--to whom he did not know at the time. And she had been depressedand sick. Twice he had seen her crying, although he said nothing, knowing that she did not want to be noticed.\n 　　There had been a few telephone calls from Lycurgus, the last on July fourth or fifth, the day before she left, hewas quite sure.\n 　　\"And what did she have with her when she left?\"\"Her bag and her little trunk.\"\"And would you recognize the bag that she carried, if you saw it?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"Is this the bag?\" (A deputy assistant district attorney carrying forward a bag and placing it on a small stand.)And Alden, after looking at it and wiping his eyes with the back of his hand, announcing: \"Yes, sir.\"And then most dramatically, as Mason intended in connection with every point in this trial, a deputy assistantcarrying in a small trunk, and Titus Alden and his wife and daughters and sons all crying at the sight of it. Andafter being identified by him as Roberta\u0027s, the bag and then the trunk were opened in turn. And the dresses madeby Roberta, some underclothing, shoes, hats, the toilet set given her by Clyde, pictures of her mother and fatherand sister and brothers, an old family cookbook, some spoons and forks and knives and salt and pepper sets--allgiven her by her grandmother and treasured by her for her married life--held up and identified in turn.\n 　　All this over Belknap\u0027s objection, and on Mason\u0027s promise to \"connect it up,\" which, however, he was unable todo, and the evidence was accordingly ordered \"struck out.\" But its pathetic significance by that time deeplyimpressed on the minds and hearts of the jurymen. And Belknap\u0027s criticism of Mason\u0027s tactics merely resulting inthat gentleman bellowing, in an infuriated manner: \"Who\u0027s conducting this prosecution, anyhow?\" To whichBelknap replied: \"The Republican candidate for county judge in this county, I believe!\"--thus evoking a wave oflaughter which caused Mason to fairly shout: \"Your Honor, I protest! This is an unethical and illegal attempt toinject into this case a political issue which has nothing to do with it. It is slyly and maliciously intended toconvey to this jury that because I am the Republican nominee for judge of the county, it is impossible for me toproperly and fairly conduct the prosecution of this case. And I now demand an apology, and will have it before Iproceed one step further in this case.\"Whereupon Justice Oberwaltzer, feeling that a very serious breach of court etiquette had occurred, proceeded tosummon Belknap and Mason before him, and after listening to placid and polite interpretations of what wasmeant, and what was not meant, finally ordered, on pain of contempt, that neither of them again refer to thepolitical situation in any way.\n 　　Nevertheless, Belknap and Jephson congratulating themselves that in this fashion their mood in regard toMason\u0027s candidacy and his use of this case to further it had effectively gotten before the jury and the court.\n 　　But more and more witnesses!\n 　　Grace Marr now taking the stand, and in a glib and voluble outpouring describing how and where she had firstmet Roberta--how pure and clean and religious a girl she was, but how after meeting Clyde on Crum Lake agreat change had come over her. She was more secretive and evasive and given to furnishing all sorts of falseexcuses for new and strange adventures--as, for instance, going out nights and staying late, and claiming to beplaces over Saturday and Sunday where she wasn\u0027t--until finally, because of criticism which she, Grace Marr,had ventured to make, she had suddenly left, without giving any address. But there was a man, and that man wasClyde Griffiths. For having followed Roberta to her room one evening in September or October of the yearbefore, she had observed her and Clyde in the distance, near the Gilpin home. They were standing under sometrees and he had his arm around her.\n 　　And thereafter Belknap, at Jephson\u0027s suggestion, taking her and by the slyest type of questioning, trying todiscover whether, before coming to Lycurgus, Roberta was as religious and conventional as Miss Marr wouldhave it. But Miss Marr, faded and irritable, insisting that up to the day of her meeting with Clyde on Crum Lake,Roberta had been the soul of truth and purity, in so far as she knew.\n 　　And next the Newtons swearing to much the same thing.\n 　　And then the Gilpins, wife and husband and daughters, each swearing to what she or he alone saw or heard. Mrs.\n 　　Gilpin as to the approximate day of Roberta\u0027s moving into her home with one small trunk and bag--the identicaltrunk and bag identified by Titus. And thereafter seeming to live very much alone until finally she, feeling sorryfor her, had suggested one type of contact and another, but Roberta invariably refusing. But later, along in lateNovember, although she had never had the heart to say anything about it to her because of her sweetness andgeneral sobriety, she and her two daughters had become aware of the fact that occasionally, after eleven o\u0027clock,it had seemed as though Roberta must be entertaining some one in her room, but just whom she could not say.\n 　　And again at this point, on cross-examination, Belknap trying to extract any admissions or impressions whichwould tend to make it look as though Roberta was a little less reserved and puritanical than all the witnesses hadthus far painted her, but failing. Mrs. Gilpin, as well as her husband, was plainly fond of her and only underpressure from Mason and later Belknap testified to Clyde\u0027s late visits.\n 　　And then the elder daughter, Stella, testifying that during the latter part of October or the first of November,shortly after Roberta had taken the room, she had passed her and a man, whom she was now able to identify asClyde, standing less than a hundred feet from the house, and noticing that they were evidently quarreling she hadpaused to listen. She was not able to distinguish every word of the conversation, but upon leading questions fromMason was able to recall that Roberta had protested that she could not let him come into her room--\"it would notlook right.\" And he had finally turned upon his heel, leaving Roberta standing with outstretched arms as ifimploring him to return.\n 　　And throughout all this Clyde staring in amazement, for he had in those days--in fact throughout his entirecontact with Roberta--imagined himself unobserved. And decidedly this confirmed much of what Mason hadcharged in his opening address--that he had willfully and with full knowledge of the nature of the offense,persuaded Roberta to do what plainly she had not wanted to do--a form of testimony that was likely to prejudicethe judge as well as the jury and all these conventional people of this rural county. And Belknap, realizing this, trying to confuse this Stella in her identification of Clyde. But only succeeding in eliciting information that sometime in November or the early part of December, shortly after the above incident, she had seen Clyde arrive, abox of some kind under his arm, and knock at Roberta\u0027s door and enter, and was then positive that he was thesame young man she had seen that moonlight night quarreling with Roberta.\n 　　And next, Whiggam, and after him Liggett, testifying as to the dates of arrival of Clyde at the factory, as well asRoberta, and as to the rule regarding department heads and female help, and, in so far as they could see, theimpeccable surface conduct of both Clyde and Roberta, neither seeming to look at the other or at any one else forthat matter. (That was Liggett testifying.)And after them again, others. Mrs. Peyton to testify as to the character of his room and his social activities in sofar as she was able to observe them. Mrs. Alden to testify that at Christmas the year before Roberta hadconfessed to her that her superior at the factory--Clyde Griffiths, the nephew of the owner--was paying attentionto her, but that it had to be kept secret for the time being. Frank Harriet, Harley Baggott, Tracy Trumbull andEddie Sells to testify that during December last Clyde had been invited here and there and had attended varioussocial gatherings in Lycurgus. John Lambert, a druggist of Schenectady, testifying that some time in January hehad been applied to by a youth, who he now identified as the defendant, for some medicine which would bringabout a miscarriage. Orrin Short to testify that in late January Clyde had asked him if he knew of a doctor whocould aid a young married woman--according to Clyde\u0027s story, the wife of an employee of Griffiths \u0026Company--who was too poor to afford a child, and whose husband, according to Clyde, had asked him for thisinformation. And next Dr. Glenn, testifying to Roberta\u0027s visit, having previously recalled her from picturespublished in the papers, but adding that professionally he had been unwilling to do anything for her.\n 　　And then C. B. Wilcox, a farmer neighbor of the Aldens, testifying to having been in the washroom back of thekitchen on or about June twenty-ninth or thirtieth, on which occasion Roberta having been called over the longdistance telephone from Lycurgus by a man who gave his name as Baker, he had heard her say to him: \"But,Clyde, I can\u0027t wait that long. You know I can\u0027t. And I won\u0027t.\" And her voice had sounded excited and distressed.\n 　　Mr. Wilcox was positive as to the name Clyde.\n 　　And Ethel Wilcox, a daughter of this same C. B.--short and fat and with a lisp--who swore that on threepreceding occasions, having received long distance requests for Roberta, she had proceeded to get her. And eachtime the call was from Lycurgus from a man named Baker. Also, on one occasion, she had heard her refer to thecaller as Clyde. And once she had heard her say that \"under no circumstances would she wait that long,\"although what she meant by that she did not know.\n 　　And next Roger Beane, a rural free delivery letter-carrier, who testified that between June seventh or eighth toJuly fourth or fifth, he had received no less than fifteen letters from Roberta herself or the mail box at thecrossroads of the Alden farm, and that he was positive that most of the letters were addressed to Clyde Griffiths,care of General Delivery, Lycurgus.\n 　　And next Amos Showalter, general delivery clerk at Lycurgus, who swore that to the best of his recollection,from or between June seventh or eighth and July fourth or fifth, Clyde, whom he knew by name, had inquired forand received not less than fifteen or sixteen letters.\n 　　And after him, R. T. Biggen, an oil station manager of Lycurgus, who swore that on the morning of July sixth, atabout eight o\u0027clock, having gone to Fielding Avenue, which was on the extreme west of the city, leading on thenorthern end to a \"stop\" on the Lycurgus and Fonda electric line, he had seen Clyde, dressed in a gray suit andwearing a straw hat and carrying a brown suit-case, to one side of which was strapped a yellow camera tripodand something else--an umbrella it might have been. And knowing in which direction Clyde lived, he hadwondered at his walking, when at Central Avenue, not so far from his home, he could have boarded the Fonda-Lycurgus car. And Belknap in his cross-examination inquiring of this witness how, being one hundred andseventy-five feet distant, he could swear that it was a tripod that he saw, and Biggens insisting that it was--it wasbright yellow and wood and had brass clops and three legs.\n 　　And then after him, John W. Troescher, station master at Fonda, who testified that on the morning of July sixthlast (he recalled it clearly because of certain other things which he listed), he had sold Roberta Alden a ticket toUtica. He recalled Miss Alden because of having noted her several times during the preceding winter. She lookedquite tired, almost sick, and carried a brown bag, something like the brown bag there and then exhibited to him.\n 　　Also he recalled the defendant, who also carried a bag. He did not see him notice or talk to the girl.\n 　　And next Quincy B. Dale, conductor of the particular train that ran from Fonda to Utica. He had noticed, andnow recalled, Clyde in one car toward the rear. He also noticed, and from photographs later published, hadrecalled Roberta.\n 　　She gave him a friendly smile and he had said that such a bag as she was carrying seemed rather heavy for herand that he would have one of the brakemen carry it out for her at Utica, for which she thanked him. He had seenher descend at Utica and disappear into the depot. He had not noticed Clyde there.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16839.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
