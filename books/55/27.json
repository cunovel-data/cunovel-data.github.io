{"id":1635,"no":27,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 8","content":"Nevertheless, the next day being a Saturday and half holiday the year round in this concern, Mr. Whiggam camethrough with the pay envelopes.\\n\\n 　　\"Here you are, Mr. Griffiths,\" he said, as though he were especially impressed with Clyde\u0027s position.\\n\\n 　　Clyde, taking it, was rather pleased with this mistering, and going back toward his locker, promptly tore it openand pocketed the money. After that, taking his hat and coat, he wandered off in the direction of his room, wherehe had his lunch. But, being very lonely, and Dillard not being present because he had to work, he decided upona trolley ride to Gloversville, which was a city of some twenty thousand inhabitants and reported to be as active,if not as beautiful, as Lycurgus. And that trip amused and interested him because it took him into a city verydifferent form Lycurgus in its social texture.\\n\\n 　　But the next day--Sunday--he spent idly in Lycurgus, wandering about by himself. For, as it turned out, Dillardwas compelled to return to Fonda for some reason and could not fulfill the Sunday understanding. EncounteringClyde, however, on Monday evening, he announced that on the following Wednesday evening, in the basementof the Diggby Avenue Congregational Church, there was to be held a social with refreshments. And according toyoung Dillard, at least this promised to prove worth while.\\n\\n 　　\"We can just go out there,\" was the way he put it to Clyde, and buzz the girls a little. I want you to meet myuncle and aunt. They\u0027re nice people all right. And so are the girls. They\u0027re no slouches. Then we can edge outafterwards, about ten, see, and go around to either Zella or Rita\u0027s place. Rita has more good records over at herplace, but Zella has the nicest place to dance. By the way, you didn\u0027t chance to bring along your dress suit withyou, did you?\" he inquired. For having already inspected Clyde\u0027s room, which was above his own on the thirdfloor, in Clyde\u0027s absence and having discovered that he had only a dress suit case and no trunk, and apparently nodress suit anywhere, he had decided that in spite of Clyde\u0027s father conducting a hotel and Clyde having worked inthe union League Club in Chicago, he must be very indifferent to social equipment. Or, if not, must beendeavoring to make his own way on some character-building plan without help from any one. This was not tohis liking, exactly. A man should never neglect these social essentials. Nevertheless, Clyde was a Griffiths andthat was enough to cause him to overlook nearly anything, for the present anyhow.\\n\\n 　　\"No, I didn\u0027t,\" replied Clyde, who was not exactly sure as to the value of this adventure--even yet--in spite of hisown loneliness,--\"but I intend to get one.\" He had already thought since coming here of his lack in this respect,and was thinking of taking at least thirty-five of his more recently hard-earned savings and indulging in a suit ofthis kind.\\n\\n 　　Dillard buzzed on about the fact that while Zella Shuman\u0027s family wasn\u0027t rich--they owned the house they livedin--still she went with a lot of nice girls here, too. So did Rita Dickerman. Zella\u0027s father owned a little cottage upon Eckert Lake, near Fonda. When next summer came--and with it the holidays and pleasant week-ends, heand Clyde, supposing that Clyde liked Rita, might go up there some time for a visit, for Rita and Zella wereinseparable almost. And they were pretty, too. \"Zella\u0027s dark and Rita\u0027s light,\" he added enthusiastically.\\n\\n 　　Clyde was interested by the fact that the girls were pretty and that out of a clear sky and in the face of his presentloneliness, he was being made so much of by this Dillard. But, was it wise for him to become very muchinvolved with him? That was the question--for, after all, he really knew nothing of him. And he gathered fromDillard\u0027s manner, his flighty enthusiasm for the occasion, that he was far more interested in the girls as girls--acertain freedom or concealed looseness that characterized them--than he was in the social phase of the worldwhich they represented. And wasn\u0027t that what brought about his downfall in Kansas City? Here in Lycurgus, ofall places, he was least likely to forget it-- aspiring to something better as he now did.\\n\\n 　　None-the-less, at eight-thirty on the following Wednesday evening--they were off, Clyde full of eageranticipation. And by nine o\u0027clock they were in the midst of one of those semi-religious, semi-social and semi-emotional church affairs, the object of which was to raise money for the church--the general service of whichwas to furnish an occasion for gossip among the elders, criticism and a certain amount of enthusiastic, ifdisguised courtship and flirtation among the younger members. There were booths for the sale of quiteeverything from pies, cakes and ice cream to laces, dolls and knickknacks of every description, supplied by themembers and parted with for the benefit of the church. The Reverend Peter Isreals, the minister, and his wifewere present. Also Dillard\u0027s uncle and aunt, a pair of brisk and yet uninteresting people whom Clyde could sensewere of no importance socially here. They were too genial and altogether social in the specific neighborhoodsense, although Grover Wilson, being a buyer for Stark and Company, endeavored to assume a serious andimportant air at times.\\n\\n 　　He was an undersized and stocky man who did not seem to know how to dress very well or could not afford it. Incontrast to his nephew\u0027s almost immaculate garb, his own suit was far from perfect-fitting. It was unpressed andslightly soiled. And his tie the same. He had a habit of rubbing his hands in a clerkly fashion, of wrinkling hisbrows and scratching the back of his head at times, as though something he was about to say had cost him greatthought and was of the utmost importance. Whereas, nothing that he uttered, as even Clyde could see, was of theslightest importance.\\n\\n 　　And so, too, with the stout and large Mrs. Wilson, who stood beside him while he was attempting to rise to theimportance of Clyde. She merely beamed a fatty beam. She was almost ponderous, and pink, with a tendency toa double chin. She smiled and smiled, largely because she was naturally genial and on her good behavior here,but incidentally because Clyde was who he was. For as Clyde himself could see, Walter Dillard had lost no timein impressing his relatives with the fact that he was a Griffiths. Also that he had encountered and made a friendof him and that he was now chaperoning him locally.\\n\\n 　　\"Walter has been telling us that you have just come on here to work for your uncle. You\u0027re at Mrs. Cuppy\u0027s now,I understand. I don\u0027t know her but I\u0027ve always heard she keeps such a nice, refined place. Mr. Parsley, who liveshere with her, used to go to school with me. But I don\u0027t see much of him any more. Did you meet him yet?\"\"No, I didn\u0027t,\" said Clyde in return.\\n\\n 　　\"Well, you know, we expected you last Sunday to dinner, only Walter had to go home. But you must come soon.\\n\\n 　　Any time at all. I would love to have you.\" She beamed and her small grayish brown eyes twinkled.\\n\\n 　　Clyde could see that because of the fame of his uncle he was looked upon as a social find, really. And so it waswith the remainder of this company, old and young--the Rev. Peter Isreals and his wife; Mr. Micah Bumpus, alocal vendor of printing inks, and his wife and son; Mr. and Mrs. Maximilian Pick, Mr. Pick being a wholesaleand retail dealer in hay, grain and feed; Mr. Witness, a florist, and Mrs. Throop, a local real estate dealer. Allknew Samuel Griffiths and his family by reputation and it seemed not a little interesting and strange to all ofthem that Clyde, a real nephew of so rich a man, should be here in their midst. The only trouble with this wasthat Clyde\u0027s manner was very soft and not as impressive as it should be--not so aggressive and contemptuous.\\n\\n 　　And most of them were of that type of mind that respects insolence even where it pretends to condemn it.\\n\\n 　　In so far as the young girls were concerned, it was even more noticeable. For Dillard was making this importantrelationship of Clyde\u0027s perfectly plain to every one. \"This is Clyde Griffiths, the nephew of Samuel Griffiths, Mr.\\n\\n 　　Gilbert Griffiths\u0027 cousin, you know. He\u0027s just come on here to study the collar business in his uncle\u0027s factory.\"And Clyde, who realized how shallow was this pretense, was still not a little pleased and impressed by the effectof it all. This Dillard\u0027s effrontery. The brassy way in which, because of Clyde, he presumed to patronize thesepeople. On this occasion, he kept guiding Clyde here and there, refusing for the most part to leave him alone foran instant. In fact he was determined that all whom he knew and liked among the girls and young men shouldknow who and what Clyde was and that he was presenting him. Also that those whom he did not like should seeas little of him as possible--not be introduced at all. \"She don\u0027t amount to anything. Her father only keeps a smallgarage here. I wouldn\u0027t bother with her if I were you.\" Or, \"He isn\u0027t much around here. Just a clerk in our store.\"At the same time, in regard to some others, he was all smiles and compliments, or at worst apologetic for theirsocial lacks.\\n\\n 　　And then he was introduced to Zella Shuman and Rita Dickerman, who, for reasons of their own, not the leastamong which was a desire to appear a little wise and more sophisticated than the others here, came a little late.\\n\\n 　　And it was true, as Clyde was to find out afterwards, that they were different, too--less simple and restricted thanquite all of the girls whom Dillard had thus far introduced him to. They were not as sound religiously andmorally as were these others. And as even Clyde noted on meeting them, they were as keen for as close anapproach to pagan pleasure without admitting it to themselves, as it was possible to be and not be marked forwhat they were. And in consequence, there was something in their manner, the very spirit of the introduction,which struck him as different from the tone of the rest of this church group--not exactly morally or religiouslyunhealthy but rather much freer, less repressed, less reserved than were these others.\\n\\n 　　\"Oh, so you\u0027re Mr. Clyde Griffiths,\" observed Zella Shuman. \"My, you look a lot like your cousin, don\u0027t you? Isee him driving down Central Avenue ever so often. Walter has been telling us all about you. Do you likeLycurgus?\"The way she said \"Walter,\" together with something intimate and possessive in the tone of her voice, causedClyde to feel at once that she must feel rather closer to and freer with Dillard than he himself had indicated. Asmall scarlet bow of velvet ribbon at her throat, two small garnet earrings in her ears, a very trim and tight-fittingblack dress, with a heavily flounced skirt, seemed to indicate that she was not opposed to showing her figure, andprized it, a mood which except for a demure and rather retiring poise which she affected, would most certainly have excited comment in such a place as this.\\n\\n 　　Rita Dickerman, on the other hand, was lush and blonde, with pink cheeks, light chestnut hair, and bluish grayeyes. Lacking the aggressive smartness which characterized Zella Shuman, she still radiated a certain somethingwhich to Clyde seemed to harmonize with the liberal if secret mood of her friend. Her manner, as Clyde couldsee, while much less suggestive of masked bravado was yielding and to him designedly so, as well as naturallyprovocative. It had been arranged that she was to intrigue him. Very much fascinated by Zella Shuman and intow of her, they were inseparable. And when Clyde was introduced to her, she beamed upon him in a meltingand sensuous way which troubled him not a little. For here in Lycurgus, as he was telling himself at the time, hemust be very careful with whom he became familiar. And yet, unfortunately, as in the case of Hortense Briggs,she evoked thoughts of intimacy, however unproblematic or distant, which troubled him. But he must be careful.\\n\\n 　　It was just such a free attitude as this suggested by Dillard as well as these girls\u0027 manners that had gotten him intotrouble before.\\n\\n 　　\"Now we\u0027ll just have a little ice cream and cake,\" suggested Dillard, after the few preliminary remarks were over,\"and then we can get out of here. You two had better go around together and hand out a few hellos. Then we canmeet at the ice cream booth. After that, if you say so, we\u0027ll leave, eh? What do you say?\"He looked at Zella Shuman as much as to say: \"You know what is the best thing to do,\" and she smiled andreplied:\\n\\n 　　\"That\u0027s right. We can\u0027t leave right away. I see my cousin Mary over there. And Mother. And Fred Bruckner. Ritaand I\u0027ll just go around by ourselves for a while and then we\u0027ll meet you, see.\" And Rita Dickerman forthwithbestowed upon Clyde an intimate and possessive smile.\\n\\n 　　After about twenty minutes of drifting and browsing, Dillard received some signal from Zella, and he and Clydepaused near the ice cream booth with its chairs in the center of the room. In a few moments they were casuallyjoined by Zella and Rita, with whom they had some ice cream and cake. And then, being free of all obligationsand as some of the others were beginning to depart, Dillard observed: \"Let\u0027s beat it. We can go over to yourplace, can\u0027t we?\"\"Sure, sure,\" whispered Zella, and together they made their way to the coat room. Clyde was still so dubious asto the wisdom of all this that he was inclined to be a little silent. He did not know whether he was fascinated byRita or not. But once out in the street out of view of the church and the homing amusement seekers, he and Ritafound themselves together, Zella and Dillard having walked on ahead. And although Clyde had taken her arm, ashe thought fit, she maneuvered it free and laid a warm and caressing hand on his elbow. And she nudged quiteclose to him, shoulder to shoulder, and half leaning on him, began pattering of the life of Lycurgus.\\n\\n 　　There was something very furry and caressing about her voice now. Clyde liked it. There was something heavyand languorous about her body, a kind of ray or electron that intrigued and lured him in spite of himself. He feltthat he would like to caress her arm and might if he wished--that he might even put his arm around her waist, andso soon. Yet here he was, a Griffiths, he was shrewd enough to think--a Lycurgus Griffiths--and that was whatnow made a difference--that made all those girls at this church social seem so much more interested in him andso friendly. Yet in spite of this thought, he did squeeze her arm ever so slightly and without reproach or comment from her.\\n\\n 　　And once in the Shuman home, which was a large old-fashioned square frame house with a square cupola, veryretired among some trees and a lawn, they made themselves at home in a general living room which was muchmore handsomely furnished than any home with which Clyde had been identified heretofore. Dillard at oncebegan sorting the records, with which he seemed most familiar, and to pull two rather large rugs out of the way,revealing a smooth, hardwood floor.\\n\\n 　　\"There\u0027s one thing about this house and these trees and these soft-toned needles,\" he commented for Clyde\u0027sbenefit, of course, since he was still under the impression that Clyde might be and probably was a very shrewdperson who was watching his every move here. \"You can\u0027t hear a note of this Victrola out in the street, can you,Zell? Nor upstairs, either, really, not with the soft needles.\\n\\n 　　We\u0027ve played it down here and danced to it several times, until three and four in the morning and they didn\u0027t evenknow it upstairs, did they, Zell?\"\"That\u0027s right. But then Father\u0027s a little hard of hearing. And Mother don\u0027t hear anything, either, when she gets inher room and gets to reading. But it is hard to hear at that.\"\"Why do people object so to dancing here?\" asked Clyde.\\n\\n 　　\"Oh, they don\u0027t--not the factory people--not at all,\" put in Dillard, \"but most of the church people do. My uncleand aunt do. And nearly everyone else we met at the church to-night, except Zell and Rita.\" He gave them a mostapproving and encouraging glance. \"And they\u0027re too broadminded to let a little thing like that bother them. Ain\u0027tthat right, Zell?\"This young girl, who was very much fascinated by him, laughed and nodded, \"You bet, that\u0027s right. I can\u0027t seeany harm in it.\"\"Nor me, either,\" put in Rita, \"nor my father and mother. Only they don\u0027t like to say anything about it or makeme feel that they want me to do too much of it.\"Dillard by then had started a piece entitled \"Brown Eyes\" and immediately Clyde and Rita and Dillard and Zellabegan to dance, and Clyde found himself insensibly drifting into a kind of intimacy with this girl which boded hecould scarcely say what. She danced so warmly and enthusiastically--a kind of weaving and swaying motionwhich suggested all sorts of repressed enthusiasms. And her lips were at once wreathed with a kind of lyric smilewhich suggested a kind of hunger for this thing. And she was very pretty, more so dancing and smiling than atany other time.\\n\\n 　　\"She is delicious,\" thought Clyde, \"even if she is a little soft. Any fellow would do almost as well as me, but shelikes me because she thinks I\u0027m somebody.\" And almost at the same moment she observed: \"Isn\u0027t it just toogorgeous? And you\u0027re such a good dancer, Mr. Griffiths.\"\"Oh, no,\" he replied, smiling into her eyes, \"you\u0027re the one that\u0027s the dancer. I can dance because you\u0027re dancing with me.\"He could feel now that her arms were large and soft, her bosom full for one so young. Exhilarated by dancing,she was quite intoxicating, her gestures almost provoking.\\n\\n 　　\"Now we\u0027ll put on \u0027The Love Boat,\u0027\" called Dillard the moment \"Brown Eyes\" was ended, \"and you and Zellacan dance together and Rita and I will have a spin, eh, Rita?\"He was so fascinated by his own skill as a dancer, however, as well as his natural joy in the art, that he couldscarcely wait to begin another, but must take Rita by the arms before putting on another record, gliding here andthere, doing steps and executing figures which Clyde could not possibly achieve and which at once establishedDillard as the superior dancer. Then, having done so, he called to Clyde to put on \"The Love Boat.\"But as Clyde could see after dancing with Zella once, this was planned to be a happy companionship of twomutually mated couples who would not interfere with each other in any way, but rather would aid each other intheir various schemes to enjoy one another\u0027s society. For while Zella danced with Clyde, and danced well andtalked to him much, all the while he could feel that she was interested in Dillard and Dillard only and wouldprefer to be with him. For, after a few dances, and while he and Rita lounged on a settee and talked, Zella andDillard left the room to go to the kitchen for a drink. Only, as Clyde observed, they stayed much longer than anysingle drink would have required.\\n\\n 　　And similarly, during this interval, it seemed as though it was intended even, by Rita, that he and she shoulddraw closer to one another. For, finding the conversation on the settee lagging for a moment, she got up andapropos of nothing--no music and no words--motioned him to dance some more with her. She had dancedcertain steps with Dillard which she pretended to show Clyde. But because of their nature, these brought her andClyde into closer contact than before--very much so. And standing so close together and showing Clyde byelbow and arm how to do, her face and cheek came very close to him--too much for his own strength of will andpurpose. He pressed his cheek to hers and she turned smiling and encouraging eyes upon him. On the instant, hisself-possession was gone and he kissed her lips. And then again--and again. And instead of withdrawing them, ashe thought she might, she let him-- remained just as she was in order that he might kiss her more.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16664.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
