{"id":1650,"no":42,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 23","content":"And then, one November evening as Clyde was walking along Wykeagy Avenue, just west of Central, a portionof the locally celebrated avenue which, ever since he had moved to Mrs. Peyton\u0027s he was accustomed to traverseto and from his work, one thing did occur which in so far as he and the Griffiths were concerned was destined tobring about a chain of events which none of them could possibly have foreseen. At the time there was in his heartand mind that singing which is the inheritance of youth and ambition and which the dying of the old year, insteadof depressing, seemed but to emphasize. He had a good position. He was respected here. Over and above hisroom and board he had not less than fifteen dollars a week to spend on himself and Roberta, an income which,while it did not parallel that which had been derived from the Green-Davidson or the union League, was still notso involved with family miseries in the one place or personal loneliness in the other. And he had Roberta secretlydevoted to him. And the Griffiths, thank goodness, did not and should not know anything of that, though justhow in case of a difficulty it was to be avoided, he was not even troubling to think. His was a disposition whichdid not tend to load itself with more than the most immediate cares. 　　And although the Griffiths and their friends had not chosen to recognize him socially, still more and more allothers who were not connected with local society and who knew of him, did. Only this very day, because thespring before he had been made a room-chief, perhaps, and Samuel Griffiths had recently paused and talked withhim, no less an important personage than Mr. Rudolph Smillie, one of the several active vice-presidents, hadasked him most cordially and casually whether he played golf, and if so, when spring came again, whether hemight not be interested to join the Amoskeag, one of the two really important golf clubs within a half dozenmiles of the city. Now, what could that mean, if not that Mr. Smillie was beginning to see him as a socialpossibility, and that he as well as many others about the factory, were becoming aware of him as some one who was of some importance to the Griffiths, if not the factory. 　　This thought, together with one other--that once more after dinner he was to see Roberta and in her room as earlyas eleven o\u0027clock or even earlier--cheered him and caused him to step along most briskly and gayly. For, sincehaving indulged in this secret adventure so many times, both were unconsciously becoming bolder. Not havingbeen detected to date, they were of the notion that it was possible they might not be. Or if they were Clyde mightbe introduced as her brother or cousin for the moment, anyhow, in order to avoid immediate scandal. Later, toavoid danger of comment or subsequent detection, as both had agreed after some discussion, Roberta might haveto move to some other place where the same routine was to be repeated. But that would be easy, or at least betterthan no freedom of contact. And with that Roberta had been compelled to agree. 　　However, on this occasion there came a contact and an interruption which set his thoughts careening in anentirely different direction. Reaching the first of the more important houses of Wykeagy Avenue, although hehad not the slightest idea who lived there, he was gazing interestedly at the high wrought-iron fence, as well asthe kempt lawn within, dimly illuminated by street lamps, and upon the surface of which he could detect manyheaps of freshly fallen brown leaves being shaken and rolled by a winnowing and gamboling wind. It was all sostarkly severe, placid, reserved, beautiful, as he saw it, that he was quite stirred by the dignity and richness of it. 　　And as he neared the central gate, above which two lights were burning, making a circle of light about it, aclosed car of great size and solidity stopped directly in front of it. And the chauffeur stepping down and openingthe door, Clyde instantly recognized Sondra Finchley leaning forward in the car. 　　\"Go around to the side entrance, David, and tell Miriam that I can\u0027t wait for her because I\u0027m going over to theTrumbulls for dinner, but that I\u0027ll be back by nine. If she\u0027s not there, leave this note and hurry, will you?\" Thevoice and manner were of that imperious and yet pleasing mode which had so intrigued him the spring before. 　　At the same time seeing, as she thought, Gilbert Griffiths approaching along the sidewalk, she called, \"Oh, hello. 　　Walking to-night? If you want to wait a minute, you can ride out with me. I\u0027ve just sent David in with a note. Hewon\u0027t be long.\"Now Sondra Finchley, despite the fact that she was interested in Bella and the Griffiths\u0027 wealth and prestige ingeneral was by no means as well pleased with Gilbert. He had been indifferent to her in the beginning when shehad tried to cultivate him and he had remained so. He had wounded her pride. And to her, who was overflowingwith vanity and self-conceit, this was the last offense, and she could not forgive him. She could not and wouldnot brook the slightest trace of ego in another, and most especially the vain, cold, self-centered person of Bella\u0027sbrother. He had too fine an opinion of himself, as she saw it, was one who was too bursting with vanity to be ofservice to anyone. \"Hmp! That stick.\" It was so that she invariably thought of him. \"Who does he think he isanyhow? He certainly does think he\u0027s a lot around here. You\u0027d think he was a Rockefeller or a Morgan. And formy part I can\u0027t see where he\u0027s a bit interesting--any more. I like Bella. I think she\u0027s lovely. But that smarty. Iguess he would like to have a girl wait on him. Well, not for me.\" Such in the main were the comments made bySondra upon such reported acts and words of Gilbert as were brought to her by others. 　　And for his part, Gilbert, hearing of the gyrations, airs, and aspirations of Sondra from Bella from time to time,was accustomed to remark: \"What, that little snip! Who does she think she is anyhow? If ever there was aconceited little nut! . . .\"However, so tightly were the social lines of Lycurgus drawn, so few the truly eligibles, that it was almostnecessary and compulsory upon those \"in\" to make the best of such others as were \"in.\" And so it was that shenow greeted Gilbert as she thought. And as she moved over slightly from the door to make room for him, Clydealmost petrified by this unexpected recognition, and quite shaken out of his pose and self-contemplation, notbeing sure whether he had heard aright, now approached, his manner the epitome almost of a self-ingratiatingand somewhat affectionate and wistful dog of high breeding and fine temperament. 　　\"Oh, good evening,\" he exclaimed, removing his cap and bowing. \"How are you?\" while his mind wasregistering that this truly was the beautiful, the exquisite Sondra whom months before he had met at his uncle\u0027s,and concerning whose social activities during the preceding summer he had been reading in the papers. And nowhere she was as lovely as ever, seated in this beautiful car and addressing him, apparently. However, Sondra onthe instant realizing that she had made a mistake and that it was not Gilbert, was quite embarrassed and uncertainfor the moment just how to extricate herself from a situation which was a bit ticklish, to say the least. 　　\"Oh, pardon me, you\u0027re Mr. Clyde Griffiths, I see now. It\u0027s my mistake. I thought you were Gilbert. I couldn\u0027tquite make you out in the light.\" She had for the moment an embarrassed and fidgety and halting manner, whichClyde noticed and which he saw implied that she had made a mistake that was not entirely flattering to him norsatisfactory to her. And this in turn caused him to become confused and anxious to retire. 　　\"Oh, pardon me. But that\u0027s all right. I didn\u0027t mean to intrude. I thought . . .\" He flushed and stepped back reallytroubled. 　　But now Sondra, seeing at once that Clyde was if anything much more attractive than his cousin and far morediffident, and obviously greatly impressed by her charms as well as her social state, unbent sufficiently to saywith a charming smile: \"But that\u0027s all right. Won\u0027t you get in, please, and let me take you where you are going. 　　Oh, I wish you would. I will be so glad to take you.\"For there was that in Clyde\u0027s manner the instant he learned that it was due to a mistake that he had beenrecognized which caused even her to understand that he was hurt, abashed and disappointed. His eyes took on ahurt look and there was a wavering, apologetic, sorrowful smile playing about his lips. 　　\"Why, yes, of course,\" he said jerkily, \"that is, if you want me to. I understand how it was. That\u0027s all right. Butyou needn\u0027t mind, if you don\u0027t wish to. I thought . . .\" He had half turned to go, but was so drawn by her that hecould scarcely tear himself away before she repeated: \"Oh, do come, get in, Mr. Griffiths. I\u0027ll be so glad if youwill. It won t take David a moment to take you wherever you are going, I\u0027m sure. And I am sorry about the other,really I am. I didn\u0027t mean, you know, that just because you weren\u0027t Gilbert Griffiths--\"He paused and in a bewildered manner stepped forward and entering the car, slipped into the seat beside her. 　　And she, interested by his personality, at once began to look at him, feeling glad that it was he now instead ofGilbert. In order the better to see and again reveal her devastating charms, as she saw them, to Clyde, she nowswitched on the roof light. And the chauffeur returning, she asked Clyde where he wished to go--an addresswhich he gave reluctantly enough, since it was so different from the street in which she resided. As the car spedon, he was animated by a feverish desire to make some use of this brief occasion which might cause her to think favorably of him--perhaps, who knows--lead to some faint desire on her part to contact him again at some timeor other. He was so truly eager to be of her world. 　　\"It\u0027s certainly nice of you to take me up this way,\" he now turned to her and observed, smiling. \"I didn\u0027t think itwas my cousin you meant or I wouldn\u0027t have come up as I did.\"\"Oh, that\u0027s all right. Don\u0027t mention it,\" replied Sondra archly with a kind of sticky sweetness in her voice. Heroriginal impression of him as she now felt, had been by no means so vivid. \"It\u0027s my mistake, not yours. But I\u0027mglad I made it now, anyhow,\" she added most definitely and with an engaging smile. \"I think I\u0027d rather pick youup than I would Gil, anyhow. We don\u0027t get along any too well, he and I. We quarrel a lot whenever we do meetanywhere.\" She smiled, having completely recovered from her momentary embarrassment, and now leaned backafter the best princess fashion, her glance examining Clyde\u0027s very regular features with interest. He had such softsmiling eyes she thought. And after all, as she now reasoned, he was Bella\u0027s and Gilbert\u0027s cousin, and lookedprosperous. 　　\"Well, that\u0027s too bad,\" he said stiffly, and with a very awkward and weak attempt at being self-confident andeven high-spirited in her presence. 　　\"Oh, it doesn\u0027t amount to anything, really. We just quarrel, that\u0027s all, once in a while.\"She saw that he was nervous and bashful and decidedly unresourceful in her presence and it pleased her to thinkthat she could thus befuddle and embarrass him so much. \"Are you still working for your uncle?\"\"Oh, yes,\" replied Clyde quickly, as though it would make an enormous difference to her if he were not. \"I havecharge of a department over there now.\"\"Oh, really, I didn\u0027t know. I haven\u0027t seen you at all, since that one time, you know. You don\u0027t get time to go aboutmuch, I suppose.\" She looked at him wisely, as much as to say, \"Your relatives aren\u0027t so very much interested inyou, but really liking him now, she said instead, \"You have been in the city all summer, I suppose?\"\"Oh, yes,\" replied Clyde quite simply and winningly. \"I have to be, you know. It\u0027s the work that keeps me here. 　　But I\u0027ve seen your name in the papers often, and read about your riding and tennis contests and I saw you in thatflower parade last June, too. I certainly thought you looked beautiful, like an angel almost.\"There was an admiring, pleading light in his eyes which now quite charmed her. What a pleasing young man--sodifferent to Gilbert. And to think he should be so plainly and hopelessly smitten, and when she could take nomore than a passing interest in him. It made her feel sorry, a little, and hence kindly toward him. Besides whatwould Gilbert think if only he knew that his cousin was so completely reduced by her--how angry he would be-he,who so plainly thought her a snip? It would serve him just right if Clyde were taken up by some one andmade more of than he (Gilbert) ever could hope to be. The thought had a most pleasing tang for her. 　　However, at this point, unfortunately, the car turned in before Mrs. Peyton\u0027s door and stopped. The adventure forClyde and for her was seemingly over. 　　\"That\u0027s awfully nice of you to say that. I won\u0027t forget that.\" She smiled archly as, the chauffeur opening the door,Clyde stepped down, his own nerves taut because of the grandeur and import of this encounter. \"So this is whereyou live. Do you expect to be in Lycurgus all winter?\"\"Oh, yes. I\u0027m quite sure of it. I hope to be anyhow,\" he added, quite yearningly, his eyes expressing his meaningcompletely. 　　\"Well, perhaps, then I\u0027ll see you again somewhere, some time. I hope so, anyhow.\"She nodded and gave him her fingers and the most fetching and wreathy of smiles, and he, eager to the point offolly, added: \"Oh, so do I.\"\"Good night! Good night!\" she called as the car sprang away, and Clyde, looking after it, wondered if he wouldever see her again so closely and intimately as here. To think that he should have met her again in this way! Andshe had proved so very different from that first time when, as he distinctly recalled, she took no interest in him atall. 　　He turned hopefully and a little wistfully toward his own door. 　　And Sondra, . . . why was it, she pondered, as the motor car sped on its way, that the Griffiths were apparentlynot much interested in him? 十一月里，有一天傍晚，克莱德正沿着中央大道西头的威克吉大街走去。 威克吉大街是莱柯格斯有名的通衢大街，从他迁居佩顿太太家以后，上下班经常路过这里。殊不知这时出了一件事，并由此引起了一连串不论是他，还是格里菲思一家人，谁都始料所不及的事。当时他心儿好象在欢唱，这正是爱好虚荣的青年人天性使然，岁暮残景不但没有压低它，好象反而使它变得更强烈了。 毕竟他有一个好的职位。他在这里受到人们敬重。除去食宿费用，每星期他还有不少于十五块美元，足够他本人和罗伯达开销。这笔收入当然比他在格林戴维逊大酒店或是联谊俱乐部时挣的钱要差得远，可是在这里，毕竟跟在堪萨斯城的时候不同，他不再与家境贫困连在一起了，而且，过去他在芝加哥时那种孤独的苦恼，现在也都没有了。此外，罗伯达还偷偷地钟爱于他哩。这事，谢天谢地，格里菲思一家人，不仅一点儿都不知道，而且说什么也不可以让他们知道。虽然他连想都没有想过，要是万一出了差错，怎么才能保守秘密，不让他们知道。他这个人的脾性是，除了眼前最迫切的烦恼以外，他压根儿不喜欢多想想的。 尽管格里菲思一家人和他们的那些朋友，不愿意让他进入自己圈子，可是，越来越多的不属于当地社会精英的其他知名人士，却给予他青睐。正好就在这一天，(也许因为今年春天他被提升为部门负责人，而且最近塞缪尔。格里菲思还停下来跟他说过话)公司副经理之一鲁道夫。斯迈利先生这一重要人物，套近乎地问他打不打高尔夫球，还说要是打的话，明年春天，是否有意加入阿莫斯基格高尔夫球俱乐部，这是离市区几英里的两个有名的高尔夫球俱乐部之一。 这不正是说明斯迈利先生开始把他当成未来的大人物了吗? 这不正是说明斯迈利先生和厂里其他人，全都开始知道，他跟格里菲思这家人是有些重要关系的，虽然他在厂里并非身居高位? 这时，他除了这个想法以外，还另外想到: 晚饭以后，他又可以跟罗伯达会面了，地点是在她房间里，而且时间定在十一点，也许还可以更早些，他不由得喜从中来，走起路也格外精神抖擞，兴高采烈了。他们俩经过这么多次幽会以后，连自己都不觉得，胆子越来越大了。迄至今日，他们一直没有被人发觉，因而也就自以为往后可能也不会被人发觉。万一发觉，她不妨暂且推说克莱德是她的哥哥或是表哥，以免马上丑闻外扬。他们商量过后还决定: 为了免得别人议论或往后被人发觉，以后罗伯达索性搬到别处去，这样，他们还可以照旧继续来往了。反正搬一次家很容易，至少也比不能自由来往要好。对此，罗伯达也不得不表示同意。 不过，这一回正好接上了一个关系，插进了一段打岔的事，使他的想法完全转向了。他走过威克吉大街极其豪华住宅区头一幢巨邸(虽然他一点儿不知道是谁的住邸)，两眼好奇地透过一道高高的铁栏杆，直瞅着暗淡的街灯光照下里面整齐的草坪。他还依稀看见草坪上一堆堆刚落下来的枯黄的树叶，被一阵风刮得狂飞乱舞起来。他觉得巨邸里这一切简直庄严。宁静。肃穆。美丽，使他对它那种富丽堂皇的气派感到非常惊心动魄。正门居中点着两盏灯，向四周围投下了一道光圈。当他走近正门时，一辆车身又大。又结实的轿车径直开到正门口，停了下来。汽车司机先下车，把车门打开，克莱德马上认出车里俯身微微向前的，正是桑德拉。芬奇利。 \"走边门，大卫，通知米丽亚姆，说我不能等她了，因为我要去特朗布尔家吃晚饭，不过，九点钟我总可以回来。她要是不在，就把这张条子留下，快一点，好吗? \"瞧她的声调和神态里，依然有着今年春天迷住他的那种颐指气使，但又惹人喜爱的派头。 而桑德拉这时却以为是吉尔伯特。格里菲思正从人行道走过来，便大声喊道: \"喂，今儿晚上你出去溜达吧? 要是能等一下，不妨搭我的车一块去。刚才我叫大卫送条子进去。一会儿他就回来。\"桑德拉。芬奇利尽管跟贝拉很要好，又承认格里菲思一家人有钱有势，可是她压根儿不喜欢吉尔伯特。原先她很想向他献殷勤，殊不知他一开始就对她冷淡，直到现在依然这样。他伤了她的自尊心。这对她这样爱好虚荣。自视甚高的人来说，简直是奇耻大辱，她怎么也不能原谅他。既然别人身上有一丁点儿自私自利她都不能容忍，也不会容忍，所以，她对贝拉的这个爱好虚荣。待人冷淡。以自我为中心的哥哥，尤其不能容忍了。她觉得，他以为自己太了不起了。这种人简直狂妄不可一世，因此，除了自己以外，对谁连想也不会想到的。\"哼! 多蠢! \"她一想到他，就有这么个看法。\"他究竟自以为是怎样一种人呢? 当然罗，他自以为是这里什么大人物哩。简直就是洛克菲勒，或是摩根! 可是，依我看，他身上一点儿都看不出有吸引人的东西……一点儿也没有。贝拉我是喜欢的。我觉得她很可爱。可是那个自作聪明的家伙，我估摸他也许还想姑娘们来巴结讨好他呢。得了吧，我才不巴结讨好他呢。只要有人告诉她有关吉尔伯特的举止谈吐时，桑德拉大致上就作出这样的评论。 至于吉尔伯特呢，他一听到贝拉讲起桑德拉自以为是的那套派头和她的雄心壮志，就常常这样说: \"嘿，这个小丫头! 瞧她究竟把自己看成什么样的人呢? 不外乎是个狂妄的小傻瓜! ……\"不过，在莱柯格斯，上流社会这个圈子本来很窄，真正够格的人很少，因此，凡是\"圈子里\"的人见面时都得彼此寒暄一下。也正因为这样，桑德拉才向她看错了的吉尔伯特打招呼。正当她把身子从车门口挪一挪，给他空出座位时，克莱德被这一突如其来的招认几乎愣住了。这时他简直茫然不知所措，自己也闹不清是不是耳朵听错了，于是往前走了过去。瞧他那副神态简直活象一头驯顺的哈叭狗，既讨人喜欢，而又在渴望着什么。 \"哦，晚上好，\"他大声说，一面摘下帽子一鞠躬，一面又说: \"您好吧? \"他心里却在估摸: 这真的就是好几个月前在伯父府上见过一面的美丽娴雅的桑德拉啊。今年夏天，他在报上不断看到有关她的交际活动的消息报道。这会儿她依然同往日一样可爱，坐在这辆漂亮的汽车里，显然是在向他打招呼呢。可是，桑德拉一下子发现她自己弄错了，此人并不是吉尔伯特，因而感到很窘，一时间真的不知道该怎么样才能从少说也有点儿棘手的困境中脱身。 \"哦，对不起，你是克莱德。格里菲思先生吧，现在我才看清楚了。我想是我把你弄错了，当成吉尔伯特了。你站在灯光下，真叫我看不清楚。\"好半晌她显得非常窘困不安，迟疑不决。这一点克莱德早已看在眼里了。同时，他还注意到: 这是因为她认错了人，显而易见，对他来说，简直太丢脸了，而对她来说，也是很扫兴的。因此，他心里也很尴尬，恨不得马上走开。 \"哦，对不起。不过，这可没有什么。我并不想打搅你。我原先以为……\"他脸一红，往后退去，心里真的感到很窘。 不过，这时桑德拉一下子看到克莱德毕竟比他的堂兄长得更漂亮，更谦虚，对她的美貌和社会地位显然也印象很深。她态度就顿时变得很随和，粲然一笑说: \"这可没有什么。请上车吧。你上哪儿去，我就送你。哦，请你别客气。我乐意送你去，得了。\"克莱德知道她看错了眼才招呼他，他的态度也马上改变了，因而她就知道此刻他很伤心，很羞愧，很失望。他眼里露出委屈的神色，嘴边却颤动着包含歉疚而又伤心的微笑。 \"哦，是啊，当然罗，\"他结结巴巴地说。\"我是说，要是您觉得方便的话。 我也明白刚才是怎么回事。这可没有什么。不过，要是您不乐意，那就大可不必了。我原先以为……\"说完，他刚转身想走，却被她深深地吸引住了，实在脱身不了。这时，她又说道: \"哦，你务必上车，格里菲思先生。你上车，我心里就很高兴。你要去的地方，大卫包管一眨眼就把你送到了。刚才的事，我很抱歉，真的非常抱歉。不过，你知道，这也不是说你因为不是吉尔伯特，我就……\"他迟疑了一会儿，然后受宠若惊地向前走去，上了车，在她身边落了座。 她对他很感兴趣，立时开始端详着他，心里一想到多亏不是吉尔伯特，因而很高兴。为了要把克莱德看个仔细，再向克莱德露一露她自以为能摄人心魄的那种魅力，她就把车厢顶上一盏灯打开。汽车司机一回来，她就问克莱德要上哪儿去……他出于无奈，只好把住址告诉了她，反正他那个地方跟她住邸所在的这条街相比，简直不可同日而语了。汽车径直往前飞也似的驰去，他心里急急乎想充分利用这一短暂的时刻，让她对他留下一个好印象……谁知道呢，也许……让她勉强愿意在往后什么时候跟他再见见面。他是真的恨不能自己成为她那个圈子里的一员啊。 \"您用车子送我，真是太好了，\"他侧转脸来向她微笑说。\"我可没有想到您是在招呼我的堂兄，要不然我也不会走上来。\"\"哦，这可没有什么。别再提它了。\"桑德拉戏谑地说，声调里带有一股甜丝丝。软绵绵的昧道。这时，她觉得，她头一次对他的印象，决没有象此刻这样鲜明。\"这是我的错，不是你的错。不过，搞错了，我反而觉得很高兴。\"她接下去说，语气很肯定，脸上露出迷人的微笑。\"反正我呀宁可捎上你，也不愿意捎上吉尔。你知道，我们俩……他跟我总是合不来。我们只要一见面，就抬杠。\"她微微一笑，刚才的窘态已完全消失了。她雍容大方地往后一靠，两眼好奇地打量着克莱德端正的面貌。她心里琢磨，他的那一双眼睛总是笑吟吟，该有多么温情脉脉。她心里还在这么想: 毕竟他是贝拉和吉尔伯特的堂兄弟，看来很春风得意哩。 \"哦，这可太要不得，\"他说话很生硬，本想在她面前佯装自己信心十足，甚至精神抖擞，结果反而显得拙劣无力。 \"哦，说实话，这也没有什么了不起。说穿了，我们有时抬杠，纯粹全是为了一些鸡毛蒜皮的事。\"她看见他在她面前很紧张。害臊，不消说，也很别扭，想到自己居然能把他弄得这样窘困不安。晕头转向，禁不住扬扬得意了。\"你还在你伯父那儿办事吗? \"\"哦，是的，\"克莱德赶紧回答她，仿佛他要是不在他伯父那儿办事，就会被她瞧不起似的。\"现在我还主管一个部门呢。\"\"嗯，是真的吗，我还不知道呢。你也知道，从上回碰面以后，我压根儿没有再见过你哩。依我看，也许你没得空出来走走，是吧? \"她意味深长地望了他一眼，仿佛要说: \"你的这些亲戚，对你并不怎么感兴趣啊。\"不过，现在她真的有些喜欢他了，就只好改口说: \"我说，你整整一个夏天都没有出过城，是吧? \"\"哦，是的，\"克莱德乐呵呵地据实相告，说: \"您也知道，我可不得不这样。 我给工作拖住了。不过，我在各报不时看见您的芳名，还看到您参加赛马。网球赛的消息。六月里花会我还看见过您呢。当然罗，我觉得您真美，几乎活脱脱象一位天使。\"他眼里闪耀出一种惊喜。爱慕之情，使她差点儿完全为之倾倒。好一个惹人喜爱的年轻人……完全不象吉尔伯特那种人。只要想一想: 她才不过偶尔一下子对他感兴趣，而他呢却那么露骨。死乞白赖地迷上了她。这就使她着实替他感到有一点儿难过，因而也就对他稍微和气一些。再说，吉尔伯特要是知道他的堂弟已被她完全征服了，又会作何感想? ……他一定会怒气冲冲……他这个人，明明把她看成傻丫头。要是有谁能助克莱德一臂之力，让他比他(吉尔伯特)所希望的更加出人头地，这才算是好好教训他一顿。她一想到这个想法，就喜从中来。 不过，就在这节骨眼上，可惜汽车已经开到佩顿太太家门口停下来了。这次巧遇，不论对克莱德来说，还是对她来说，看来就这样结束了。 \"多承您夸奖，我可不会忘记的。\"汽车司机打开车门，克莱德下车时，她戏谑地微笑着。他下了车，心中却被这次极不寻常的邂逅感到万分紧张。\"哦，您就住在这里呀。你打算在莱柯格斯过一冬，是吧? \"\"哦，是的。我想准是这样。至少我希望是这样，\"他若有所思地找补着说，这一层意思也在他眼里充分表达无遗。 \"好吧，也许，下次我还会跟您再见面。至少我是这样希望。\"她点点头，非常迷人，但又圆滑地微微一笑，向他伸出手来。而他呢，这时心里已经急得快要发疯似的，马上说: \"哦，我也是这样。\"\"再见! 再见! \"车已开动了，她大声喊道。克莱德眼望着这辆车远去，心里纳闷，真不知道他还能不能象刚才那样亲密无间地跟她再见见面。啊，真想不到此刻他竟然这样跟她不期而遇! 而且，她跟头一次见面时完全不一样。克莱德还清楚地记得，那时她对他压根儿不感兴趣。 他满怀希望，若有所思地转过身来，朝自己的住处走去。 那末桑德拉呢，……汽车径直往前驰去时，她心里暗自寻思，为什么格里菲思一家人，看来对他一点儿也不感兴趣呢?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16679.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
