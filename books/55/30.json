{"id":1638,"no":30,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 11","content":"The days lapsed and, although no further word came from the Griffiths, Clyde was still inclined to exaggerate theimportance of this one contact and to dream from time to time of delightful meetings with those girls and howwonderful if a love affair with one of them might eventuate for him. The beauty of that world in which theymoved. The luxury and charm as opposed to this of which he was a part. Dillard! Rita! Tush! They were reallydead for him. He aspired to this other or nothing as he saw it now and proceeded to prove as distant to Dillard aspossible, an attitude which by degrees tended to alienate that youth entirely for he saw in Clyde a snob whichpotentially he was if he could have but won to what he desired. However, as he began to see afterwards, timepassed and he was left to work until, depressed by the routine, meager pay and commonplace shrinking-roomcontacts, he began to think not so much of returning to Rita or Dillard,--he could not quite think of them nowwith any satisfaction, but of giving up this venture here and returning to Chicago or going to New York, wherehe was sure that he could connect himself with some hotel if need be. But then, as if to revive his courage andconfirm his earlier dreams, a thing happened which caused him to think that certainly he was beginning to rise inthe estimation of the Griffiths--father and son--whether they troubled to entertain him socially or not. For itchanced that one Saturday in spring, Samuel Griffiths decided to make a complete tour of inspection of thefactory with Joshua Whiggam at his elbow. Reaching the shrinking department about noon, he observed for thefirst time with some dismay, Clyde in his undershirt and trousers working at the feeding end of two of theshrinking racks, his nephew having by this time acquired the necessary skill to \"feed\" as well as \"take.\" Andrecalling how very neat and generally presentable he had appeared at his house but a few weeks before, he wasdecidedly disturbed by the contrast. For one thing he had felt about Clyde, both in Chicago and here at his home,was that he had presented a neat and pleasing appearance. And he, almost as much as his son, was jealous, not only of the name, but the general social appearance of the Griffiths before the employees of this factory as wellas the community at large. And the sight of Clyde here, looking so much like Gilbert and in an armless shirt andtrousers working among these men, tended to impress upon him more sharply than at any time before the factthat Clyde was his nephew, and that he ought not to be compelled to continue at this very menial form of workany longer. To the other employees it might appear that he was unduly indifferent to the meaning of such arelationship.\\n\\n 　　Without, however, saying a word to Whiggam or anyone else at the time, he waited until his son returned onMonday morning, from a trip that he had taken out of town, when he called him into his office and observed: \"Imade a tour of the factory Saturday and found young Clyde still down in the shrinking room.\"\"What of it, Dad?\" replied his son, curiously interested as to why his father should at this time wish to mentionClyde in this special way. \"Other people before him have worked down there and it hasn\u0027t hurt them.\"\"All true enough, but they weren\u0027t nephews of mine. And they didn\u0027t look as much like you as he does\"--acomment which irritated Gilbert greatly. \"It won\u0027t do, I tell you. It doesn\u0027t look quite right to me, and I\u0027m afraid itwon\u0027t look right to other people here who see how much he looks like you and know that he is your cousin andmy nephew. I didn\u0027t realize that at first, because I haven\u0027t been down there, but I don\u0027t think it wise to keep himdown there any longer doing that kind of thing. It won\u0027t do. We\u0027ll have to make a change, switch him aroundsomewhere else where he won\u0027t look like that.\"His eyes darkened and his brow wrinkled. The impression that Clyde made in his old clothes and with beads ofsweat standing out on his forehead had not been pleasant.\\n\\n 　　\"But I\u0027ll tell you how it is, Dad,\" Gilbert persisted, anxious and determined because of his innate opposition toClyde to keep him there if possible. \"I\u0027m not so sure that I can find just the right place for him now anywhereelse--at least not without moving someone else who has been here a long time and worked hard to get there. Hehasn\u0027t had any training in anything so far, but just what he\u0027s doing.\"\"Don\u0027t know or don\u0027t care anything about that,\" replied Griffiths senior, feeling that his son was a little jealousand in consequence disposed to be unfair to Clyde. \"That\u0027s no place for him and I won\u0027t have him there anylonger. He\u0027s been there long enough. And I can\u0027t afford to have the name of any of this family come to meananything but just what it does around here now-- reserve and ability and energy and good judgment. It\u0027s not goodfor the business. And anything less than that is a liability. You get me, don\u0027t you?\"\"Yes, I get you all right, governor.\"\"Well, then, do as I say. Get hold of Whiggam and figure out some other place for him around here, and not aspiece worker or a hand either. It was a mistake to put him down there in the first place. There must be some littleplace in one of the departments where he can be fitted in as the head of something, first or second or thirdassistant to some one, and where he can wear a decent suit of clothes and look like somebody. And, if necessary,let him go home on full pay until you find something for him. But I want him changed. By the way, how much ishe being paid now?\"\"About fifteen, I think,\" replied Gilbert blandly.\\n\\n 　　\"Not enough, if he\u0027s to make the right sort of an appearance here. Better make it twenty-five. It\u0027s more than he\u0027sworth, I know, but it can\u0027t be helped now. He has to have enough to live on while he\u0027s here, and from now on, I\u0027drather pay him that than have any one think we were not treating him right.\"\"All right, all right, governor. Please don\u0027t be cross about it, will you?\" pleaded Gilbert, noting his father\u0027sirritation. \"I\u0027m not entirely to blame. You agreed to it in the first place when I suggested it, didn\u0027t you? But Iguess you\u0027re right at that. Just leave it to me. I\u0027ll find a decent place for him,\" and turning, he proceeded in searchof Whiggam, although at the same time thinking how he was to effect all this without permitting Clyde to get thenotion that he was at all important here--to make him feel that this was being done as a favor to him and not forany reasons of merit in connection with himself.\\n\\n 　　And at once, Whiggam appearing, he, after a very diplomatic approach on the part of Gilbert, racked his brains,scratched his head, went away and returned after a time to say that the only thing he could think of, since Clydewas obviously lacking in technical training, was that of assistant to Mr. Liggett, who was foreman in charge offive big stitching rooms on the fifth floor, but who had under him one small and very special, though by nomeans technical, department which required the separate supervision of either an assistant forelady or man.\\n\\n 　　This was the stamping room--a separate chamber at the west end of the stitching floor, where were received dailyfrom the cutting room above from seventy-five to one hundred thousand dozen unstitched collars of differentbrands and sizes. And here they were stamped by a group of girls according to the slips or directions attached tothem with the size and brand of the collar. The sole business of the assistant foreman in charge here, as Gilbertwell knew, after maintaining due decorum and order, was to see that this stamping process went uninterruptedlyforward. Also that after the seventy-five to one hundred thousand dozen collars were duly stamped andtransmitted to the stitchers, who were just outside in the larger room, to see that they were duly credited in abook of entry. And that the number of dozens stamped by each girl was duly recorded in order that her payshould correspond with her services.\\n\\n 　　For this purpose a little desk and various entry books, according to size and brand, were kept here. Also thecutters\u0027 slips, as taken from the bundles by the stampers were eventually delivered to this assistant in lots of adozen or more and filed on spindles. It was really nothing more than a small clerkship, at times in the past heldby young men or girls or old men or middle-aged women, according to the exigencies of the life of the place.\\n\\n 　　The thing that Whiggam feared in connection with Clyde and which he was quick to point out to Gilbert on thisoccasion was that because of his inexperience and youth Clyde might not, at first, prove as urgent and insistent amaster of this department as the work there required. There were nothing but young girls there--some of themquite attractive. Also was it wise to place a young man of Clyde\u0027s years and looks among so many girls? For,being susceptible, as he might well be at that age, he might prove too easy--not stern enough. The girls mighttake advantage of him. If so, it wouldn\u0027t be possible to keep him there very long. Still there was this temporaryvacancy, and it was the only one in the whole factory at the moment. Why not, for the time being, send himupstairs for a tryout? It might not be long before either Mr. Liggett or himself would know of something else orwhether or not he was suited for the work up there. In that case it would be easy to make a re- transfer.\\n\\n 　　Accordingly, about three in the afternoon of this same Monday, Clyde was sent for and after being made to waitfor some fifteen minutes, as was Gilbert\u0027s method, he was admitted to the austere presence.\\n\\n 　　\"Well, how are you getting along down where you are now?\" asked Gilbert coldly and inquisitorially. AndClyde, who invariably experienced a depression whenever he came anywhere near his cousin, replied, with apoorly forced smile, \"Oh, just about the same, Mr. Griffiths. I can\u0027t complain. I like it well enough. I\u0027m learning alittle something, I guess.\"\"You guess?\"\"Well, I know I\u0027ve learned a few things, of course,\" added Clyde, flushing slightly and feeling down deep withinhimself a keen resentment at the same time that he achieved a half-ingratiating and half-apologetic smile.\\n\\n 　　\"Well, that\u0027s a little better. A man could hardly be down there as long as you\u0027ve been and not know whether hehad learned anything or not.\" Then deciding that he was being too severe, perhaps, he modified his tone slightly,and added: \"But that\u0027s not why I sent for you. There\u0027s another matter I want to talk to you about. Tell me, did youever have charge of any people or any other person than yourself, at any time in your life?\"\"I don\u0027t believe I quite understand,\" replied Clyde, who, because he was a little nervous and flustered, had notquite registered the question accurately.\\n\\n 　　\"I mean have you ever had any people work under you--been given a few people to direct in some departmentsomewhere? Been a foreman or an assistant foreman in charge of anything?\"\"No, sir, I never have,\" answered Clyde, but so nervous that he almost stuttered. For Gilbert\u0027s tone was verysevere and cold--highly contemptuous. At the same time, now that the nature of the question was plain, itsimplication came to him. In spite of his cousin\u0027s severity, his ill manner toward him, still he could see hisemployers were thinking of making a foreman of him--putting him in charge of somebody--people. They mustbe! At once his ears and fingers began to titillate--the roots of his hair to tingle: \"But I\u0027ve seen how it\u0027s done inclubs and hotels,\" he added at once. \"And I think I might manage if I were given a trial.\" His cheeks were nowhighly colored--his eyes crystal clear.\\n\\n 　　\"Not the same thing. Not the same thing,\" insisted Gilbert sharply. \"Seeing and doing are two entirely differentthings. A person without any experience can think a lot, but when it comes to doing, he\u0027s not there. Anyhow, thisis one business that requires people who do know.\"He stared at Clyde critically and quizzically while Clyde, feeling that he must be wrong in his notion thatsomething was going to be done for him, began to quiet himself. His cheeks resumed their normal pallor and thelight died from his eyes.\\n\\n 　　\"Yes, sir, I guess that\u0027s true, too,\" he commented.\\n\\n 　　\"But you don\u0027t need to guess in this case,\" insisted Gilbert. \"You know. That\u0027s the trouble with people who don\u0027tknow. They\u0027re always guessing.\"The truth was that Gilbert was so irritated to think that he must now make a place for his cousin, and that despitehis having done nothing at all to deserve it, that he could scarcely conceal the spleen that now colored his mood.\\n\\n 　　\"You\u0027re right, I know,\" said Clyde placatingly, for he was still hoping for this hinted-at promotion.\\n\\n 　　\"Well, the fact is,\" went on Gilbert, \"I might have placed you in the accounting end of the business when youfirst came if you had been technically equipped for it.\" (The phrase \"technically equipped\" overawed andterrorized Clyde, for he scarcely understood what that meant.) \"As it was,\" went on Gilbert, nonchalantly, \"wehad to do the best we could for you. We knew it was not very pleasant down there, but we couldn\u0027t do anythingmore for you at the time.\" He drummed on his desk with his fingers. \"But the reason I called you up here to-dayis this. I want to discuss with you a temporary vacancy that has occurred in one of our departments upstairs andwhich we are wondering--my father and I--whether you might be able to fill.\" Clyde\u0027s spirits rose amazingly.\\n\\n 　　\"Both my father and I,\" he went on, \"have been thinking for some little time that we would like to do a littlesomething for you, but as I say, your lack of practical training of any kind makes it very difficult for both of us.\\n\\n 　　You haven\u0027t had either a commercial or a trade education of any kind, and that makes it doubly hard.\" He pausedlong enough to allow that to sink in--give Clyde the feeling that he was an interloper indeed. \"Still,\" he addedafter a moment, \"so long as we have seen fit to bring you on here, we have decided to give you a tryout atsomething better than you are doing. It won\u0027t do to let you stay down there indefinitely. Now, let me tell you alittle something about what I have in mind,\" and he proceeded to explain the nature of the work on the fifth floor.\\n\\n 　　And when after a time Whiggam was sent for and appeared and had acknowledged Clyde\u0027s salutation, heobserved: \"Whiggam, I\u0027ve just been telling my cousin here about our conversation this morning and what I toldyou about our plan to try him out as the head of that department. So if you\u0027ll just take him up to Mr. Liggett andhave him or some one explain the nature of the work up there, I\u0027ll be obliged to you.\" He turned to his desk.\\n\\n 　　\"After that you can send him back to me,\" he added. \"I want to talk to him again.\"Then he arose and dismissed them both with an air, and Whiggam, still somewhat dubious as to the experiment,but now very anxious to be pleasant to Clyde since he could not tell what he might become, led the way to Mr.\\n\\n 　　Liggett\u0027s floor. And there, amid a thunderous hum of machines, Clyde was led to the extreme west of thebuilding and into a much smaller department which was merely railed off from the greater chamber by a lowfence. Here were about twenty-five girls and their assistants with baskets, who apparently were doing their bestto cope with a constant stream of unstitched collar bundles which fell through several chutes from the floorabove.\\n\\n 　　And now at once, after being introduced to Mr. Liggett, he was escorted to a small railed-off desk at which sat ashort, plump girl of about his own years, not so very attractive, who arose as they approached. \"This is MissTodd,\" began Whiggain. \"She\u0027s been in charge for about ten days now in the absence of Mrs. Angier. And what Iwant you to do now, Miss Todd, is to explain to Mr. Griffiths here just as quickly and clearly as you can what itis you do here. And then later in the day when he comes up here, I want you to help him to keep track of thingsuntil he sees just what is wanted and can do it himself. You\u0027ll do that, won\u0027t you?\"\"Why, certainly, Mr. Whiggam. I\u0027ll be only too glad to,\" complied Miss Todd, and at once she began to takedown the books of records and to show Clyde how the entry and discharge records were kept--also later how the stamping was done--how the basket girls took the descending bundles from the chutes and distributed themevenly according to the needs of the stamper and how later, as fast as they were stamped, other basket girlscarried them to the stitchers outside. And Clyde, very much interested, felt that he could do it, only among somany women on a floor like this he felt very strange. There were so very, very many women--hundreds of them-stretchingfar and away between white walls and white columns to the eastern end of the building. And tallwindows that reached from floor to ceiling let in a veritable flood of light. These girls were not all pretty. He sawthem out of the tail of his eye as first Miss Todd and later Whiggam, and even Liggett, volunteered to impresspoints on him.\\n\\n 　　\"The important thing,\" explained Whiggam after a time, \"is to see that there is no mistake as to the number ofthousands of dozens of collars that come down here and are stamped, and also that there\u0027s no delay in stampingthem and getting them out to the stitchers. Also that the records of these girls\u0027 work is kept accurately so thatthere won\u0027t be any mistakes as to their time.\"At last Clyde saw what was required of him and the conditions under which he was about to work and said so.\\n\\n 　　He was very nervous but quickly decided that if this girl could do the work, he could. And because Liggett andWhiggam, interested by his relationship to Gilbert, appeared very friendly and persisted in delaying here, sayingthat there was nothing he could not manage they were sure, he returned after a time with Whiggam to Gilbertwho, on seeing him enter, at once observed: \"Well, what\u0027s the answer? Yes or no. Do you think you can do it ordo you think you can\u0027t?\"\"Well, I know that I can do it,\" replied Clyde with a great deal of courage for him, yet with the private feelingthat he might not make good unless fortune favored him some even now. There were so many things to be takeninto consideration--the favor of those above as well as about him--and would they always favor him?\\n\\n 　　\"Very good, then. Just be seated for a moment,\" went on Gilbert. \"I want to talk to you some more in connectionwith that work up there. It looks easy to you, does it?\"\"No, I can\u0027t say that it looks exactly easy,\" replied Clyde, strained and a little pale, for because of hisinexperience he felt the thing to be a great opportunity--one that would require all his skill and courage tomaintain. \"Just the same I think I can do it. In fact I know I can and I\u0027d like to try.\"\"Well, now, that sounds a little better,\" replied Gilbert crisply and more graciously. \"And now I want to tell yousomething more about it. I don\u0027t suppose you ever thought there was a floor with that many women on it, didyou?\"\"No, sir, I didn\u0027t,\" replied Clyde. \"I knew they were somewhere in the building, but I didn\u0027t know just where.\"\"Exactly,\" went on Gilbert. \"This plant is practically operated by women from cellar to roof. In themanufacturing department, I venture to say there are ten women to every man. On that account every one inwhom we entrust any responsibility around here must be known to us as to their moral and religious character. Ifyou weren\u0027t related to us, and if we didn\u0027t feel that because of that we knew a little something about you, wewouldn\u0027t think of putting you up there or anywhere in this factory over anybody until we did know. But don\u0027tthink because you\u0027re related to us that we won\u0027t hold you strictly to account for everything that goes on up there and for your conduct. We will, and all the more so because you are related to us. You understand that, do you?\\n\\n 　　And why--the meaning of the Griffiths name here?\"\"Yes, sir,\" replied Clyde.\\n\\n 　　\"Very well, then,\" went on Gilbert. \"Before we place any one here in any position of authority, we have to beabsolutely sure that they\u0027re going to behave themselves as gentlemen always--that the women who are workinghere are going to receive civil treatment always. If a young man, or an old one for that matter, comes in here atany time and imagines that because there are women here he\u0027s going to be allowed to play about and neglect hiswork and flirt or cut up, that fellow is doomed to a short stay here. The men and women who work for us havegot to feel that they are employees first, last and all the time--and they have to carry that attitude out into thestreet with them. And unless they do it, and we hear anything about it, that man or woman is done for so far aswe are concerned. We don\u0027t want \u0027em and we won\u0027t have \u0027em. And once we\u0027re through with \u0027em, we\u0027re throughwith \u0027em.\"He paused and stared at Clyde as much as to say: \"Now I hope I have made myself clear. Also that we will neverhave any trouble in so far as you are concerned.\"And Clyde replied: \"Yes, I understand. I think that\u0027s right. In fact I know that\u0027s the way it has to be.\"\"And ought to be,\" added Gilbert.\\n\\n 　　\"And ought to be,\" echoed Clyde.\\n\\n 　　At the same time he was wondering whether it was really true as Gilbert said. Had he not heard the mill girlsalready spoken about in a slighting way? Yet consciously at the moment he did not connect himself in thoughtwith any of these girls upstairs. His present mood was that, because of his abnormal interest in girls, it would bebetter if he had nothing to do with them at all, never spoke to any of them, kept a very distant and cold attitude,such as Gilbert was holding toward him. It must be so, at least if he wished to keep his place here. And he wasnow determined to keep it and to conduct himself always as his cousin wished.\\n\\n 　　\"Well, now, then,\" went on Gilbert as if to supplement Clyde\u0027s thoughts in this respect, \"what I want to know ofyou is, if I trouble to put you in that department, even temporarily, can I trust you to keep a level head on yourshoulders and go about your work conscientiously and not have your head turned or disturbed by the fact thatyou\u0027re working among a lot of women and girls?\"\"Yes, sir, I know you can,\" replied Clyde very much impressed by his cousin\u0027s succinct demand, although, afterRita, a little dubious.\\n\\n 　　\"If I can\u0027t, now is the time to say so,\" persisted Gilbert. \"By blood you\u0027re a member of this family. And to ourhelp here, and especially in a position of this kind, you represent us. We can\u0027t have anything come up inconnection with you at any time around here that won\u0027t be just right. So I want you to be on your guard andwatch your step from now on. Not the least thing must occur in connection with you that any one can commenton unfavorably. You understand, do you?\"\"Yes, sir,\" replied Clyde most solemnly. \"I understand that. I\u0027ll conduct myself properly or I\u0027ll get out.\" And hewas thinking seriously at the moment that he could and would. The large number of girls and women upstairsseemed very remote and of no consequence just then.\\n\\n 　　\"Very good. Now, I\u0027ll tell you what else I want you to do. I want you to knock off for the day and go home andsleep on this and think it over well. Then come back in the morning and go to work up there, if you still feel thesame. Your salary from now on will be twenty-five dollars, and I want you to dress neat and clean so that youwill be an example to the other men who have charge of departments.\"He arose coldly and distantly, but Clyde, very much encouraged and enthused by the sudden jump in salary, aswell as the admonition in regard to dressing well, felt so grateful toward his cousin that he longed to be friendlywith him. To be sure, he was hard and cold and vain, but still he must think something of him, and his uncle too,or they would not choose to do all this for him and so speedily. And if ever he were able to make friends withhim, win his way into his good graces, think how prosperously he would be placed here, what commercial andsocial honors might not come to him?\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16667.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
