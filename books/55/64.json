{"id":1672,"no":64,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 45","content":"There are moments when in connection with the sensitively imaginative or morbidly anachronistic--the mentalityassailed and the same not of any great strength and the problem confronting it of sufficient force andcomplexity--the reason not actually toppling from its throne, still totters or is warped or shaken--the mindbefuddled to the extent that for the time being, at least, unreason or disorder and mistaken or erroneous counselwould appear to hold against all else. In such instances the will and the courage confronted by some greatdifficulty which it can neither master nor endure, appears in some to recede in precipitate flight, leaving onlypanic and temporary unreason in its wake. 　　And in this instance, the mind of Clyde might well have been compared to a small and routed army in full flightbefore a major one, yet at various times in its precipitate departure, pausing for a moment to meditate on someway of escaping complete destruction and in the coincident panic of such a state, resorting to the weirdest andmost haphazard of schemes of escaping from an impending and yet wholly unescapable fate. The strained andbedeviled look in his eyes at moments--the manner in which, from moment to moment and hour to hour, he wentover and over his hitherto poorly balanced actions and thoughts but with no smallest door of escape anywhere. 　　And yet again at moments the solution suggested by the item in The Times-union again thrusting itself forward,psychogenetically, born of his own turbulent, eager and disappointed seeking. And hence persisting. 　　Indeed, it was now as though from the depths of some lower or higher world never before guessed or plumbed byhim . . . a region otherwhere than in life or death and peopled by creatures otherwise than himself . . . there hadnow suddenly appeared, as the genie at the accidental rubbing of Aladdin\u0027s lamp--as the efrit emerging as smokefrom the mystic jar in the net of the fisherman--the very substance of some leering and diabolic wish or wisdomconcealed in his own nature, and that now abhorrent and yet compelling, leering and yet intriguing, friendly andyet cruel, offered him a choice between an evil which threatened to destroy him (and against his deepestopposition) and a second evil which, however it might disgust or sear or terrify, still provided for freedom andsuccess and love. 　　Indeed the center or mentating section of his brain at this time might well have been compared to a sealed andsilent hall in which alone and undisturbed, and that in spite of himself, he now sat thinking on the mystic or eviland terrifying desires or advice of some darker or primordial and unregenerate nature of his own, and without thepower to drive the same forth or himself to decamp, and yet also without the courage to act upon anything. 　　For now the genie of his darkest and weakest side was speaking. And it said: \"And would you escape from thedemands of Roberta that but now and unto this hour have appeared unescapable to you? Behold! I bring you away. It is the way of the lake--Pass Lake. This item that you have read--do you think it was placed in your handsfor nothing? Remember Big Bittern, the deep, blue-black water, the island to the south, the lone road to ThreeMile Bay? How suitable to your needs! A row-boat or a canoe upset in such a lake and Roberta would passforever from your life. She cannot swim! The lake--the lake--that you have seen--that I have shown you--is it not ideal for the purpose? So removed and so little frequented and yet comparatively near--but a hundred miles fromhere. And how easy for you and Roberta to go there--not directly but indirectly--on this purely imaginativemarriage-trip that you have already agreed to. And all that you need do now is to change your name--and hers-orlet her keep her own and you use yours. You have never permitted her to speak of you and this relationship,and she never has. You have written her but formal notes. And now if you should meet her somewhere as youhave already agreed to, and without any one seeing you, you might travel with her, as in the past to Fonda, to BigBittern--or some point near there.\"\"But there is no hotel at Big Bittern,\" at once corrected Clyde. \"A mere shack that entertains but few people andthat not very well.\"\"All the better. The less people are likely to be there.\"\"But we might be seen on the train going up together. I would be identified as having been with her.\"\"Were you seen at Fonda, Gloversville, Little Falls? Have you not ridden in separate cars or seats before andcould you not do so now? Is it not presumably to be a secret marriage? Then why not a secret honeymoon?\"\"True enough--true enough.\"\"And once you have arranged for that and arrive at Big Bittern or some lake like it--there are so many there--howeasy to row out on such a lake? No questions. No registry under your own name or hers. A boat rented for anhour or half-day or day. You saw the island far to the south on that lone lake. Is it not beautiful? It is well worthseeing. Why should you not go there on such a pleasure trip before marriage? Would she not be happy so to do-asweary and distressed as she is now--an outing--a rest before the ordeal of the new life? Is not that sensible-plausible? 　　And neither of you will ever return presumably. You will both be drowned, will you not? Who is tosee? A guide or two--the man who rents you the boat--the innkeeper once, as you go. But how are they to knowwho you are? Or who she is? And you heard the depth of the water.\"\"But I do not want to kill her. I do not want to kill her. I do not want to injure her in any way. If she will but letme go and she go her own way, I will be so glad and so happy never to see her more.\"\"But she will not let you go or go her way unless you accompany her. And if you go yours, it will be withoutSondra and all that she represents, as well as all this pleasant life here--your standing with your uncle, hisfriends, their cars, the dances, visits to the lodges on the lakes. And what then? A small job! Small pay! Anothersuch period of wandering as followed that accident at Kansas City. Never another chance like this anywhere. Doyou prefer that?\"\"But might there not be some accident here, destroying all my dreams--my future--as there was in Kansas City?\"\"An accident, to be sure--but not the same. In this instance the plan is in your hands. You can arrange it all asyou will. And how easy! So many boats upsetting every summer--the occupants of them drowning, because inmost cases they cannot swim. And will it ever be known whether the man who was with Roberta Alden on BigBittern could swim? And of all deaths, drowning is the easiest--no noise--no outcry--perhaps the accidental blow of an oar--the side of a boat. And then silence! Freedom--a body that no one may ever find. Or if found andidentified, will it not be easy, if you but trouble to plan, to make it appear that you were elsewhere, visiting atone of the other lakes before you decided to go to Twelfth Lake. What is wrong with it? Where is the flaw?\"\"But assuming that I should upset the boat and that she should not drown, then what? Should cling to it, cry out,be saved and relate afterward that. . . But no, I cannot do that--will not do it. I will not hit her. That would be tooterrible . . . too vile.\"\"But a little blow--any little blow under such circumstances would be sufficient to confuse and complete herundoing. Sad, yes, but she has an opportunity to go her own way, has she not? And she will not, nor let you goyours. Well, then, is this so terribly unfair? And do not forget that afterwards there is Sondra--the beautiful--ahome with her in Lycurgus--wealth, a high position such as elsewhere you may never obtain again--never--never. 　　Love and happiness--the equal of any one here--superior even to your cousin Gilbert.\"The voice ceased temporarily, trailing off into shadow,--silence, dreams. 　　And Clyde, contemplating all that had been said, was still unconvinced. Darker fears or better impulsessupplanted the counsel of the voice in the great hall. But presently thinking of Sondra and all that sherepresented, and then of Roberta, the dark personality would as suddenly and swiftly return and with amplifiedsuavity and subtlety. 　　\"Ah, still thinking on the matter. And you have not found a way out and you will not. I have truly pointed out toyou and in all helpfulness the only way--the only way--It is a long lake. And would it not be easy in rowingabout to eventually find some secluded spot--some invisible nook near that south shore where the water is deep? 　　And from there how easy to walk through the woods to Three Mile Bay and Upper Greys Lake? And from thereto the Cranstons\u0027? There is a boat from there, as you know. Pah--how cowardly--how lacking in courage to winthe thing that above all things you desire--beauty--wealth--position--the solution of your every material andspiritual desire. And with poverty, commonplace, hard and poor work as the alternative to all this. 　　\"But you must choose--choose! And then act. You must! You must! You must!\"Thus the voice in parting, echoing from some remote part of the enormous chamber. 　　And Clyde, listening at first with horror and in terror, later with a detached and philosophic calm as one who,entirely apart from what he may think or do, is still entitled to consider even the wildest and most desperateproposals for his release, at last, because of his own mental and material weakness before pleasures and dreamswhich he could not bring himself to forego, psychically intrigued to the point where he was beginning to thinkthat it might be possible. Why not? Was it not even as the voice said--a possible and plausible way--all hisdesires and dreams to be made real by this one evil thing? Yet in his case, because of flaws and weaknesses inhis own unstable and highly variable will, the problem was not to be solved by thinking thus--then--nor for thenext ten days for that matter. 　　He could not really act on such a matter for himself and would not. It remained as usual for him to be forcedeither to act or to abandon this most WILD and terrible thought. Yet during this time a series of letters--seven from Roberta, five from Sondra--in which in somber tones in so far as Roberta was concerned--in gay andcolorful ones in those which came from Sondra--was painted the now so sharply contrasting phases of the blackrebus which lay before him. To Roberta\u0027s pleadings, argumentative and threatening as they were, Clyde did nottrust himself to reply, not even by telephone. For now he reasoned that to answer would be only to lure Robertato her doom--or to the attempted drastic conclusion of his difficulties as outlined by the tragedy at Pass Lake. 　　At the same time, in several notes addressed to Sondra, he gave vent to the most impassioned declarations oflove--his darling--his wonder girl--how eager he was to be at Twelfth Lake by the morning of the Fourth, if hecould, and so thrilled to see her there again. Yet, alas, as he also wrote now, so uncertain was he, even now, as tohow he was to do, there were certain details in connection with his work here that might delay him a day or twoor three--he could not tell as yet--but would write her by the second at the latest, when he would know positively. 　　Yet saying to himself as he wrote this, if she but knew what those details were--if she but knew. Yet in penningthis, and without having as yet answered the last importunate letter from Roberta, he was also saying to himselfthat this did not mean that he was planning to go to Roberta at all, or that if he did, it did not mean that he wasgoing to attempt to kill her. Never once did he honestly, or to put it more accurately, forthrightly andcourageously or coldly face the thought of committing so grim a crime. On the contrary, the nearer heapproached a final resolution or the need for one in connection with all this, the more hideous and terribleseemed the idea--hideous and difficult, and hence the more improbable it seemed that he should ever commit it. 　　It was true that from moment to moment--arguing with himself as he constantly was--sweating mental sweatsand fleeing from moral and social terrors in connection with it all, he was thinking from time to time that hemight go to Big Bittern in order to quiet her in connection with these present importunities and threats and hence(once more evasion--tergiversation with himself) give himself more time in which to conclude what his truecourse must be. 　　The way of the Lake. 　　The way of the Lake. 　　But once there--whether it would then be advisable so to do--or not--well who could tell. He might even yet beable to convert Roberta to some other point of view. For, say what you would, she was certainly acting veryunfairly and captiously in all this. She was, as he saw it in connection with his very vital dream of Sondra,making a mountain--an immense terror--out of a state that when all was said and done, was not so different fromEsta\u0027s. And Esta had not compelled any one to marry her. And how much better were the Aldens to his ownparents--poor farmers as compared to poor preachers. And why should he be so concerned as to what they wouldthink when Esta had not troubled to think what her parents would feel? 　　In spite of all that Roberta had said about blame, was she so entirely lacking in blame herself? To be sure, he hadsought to entice or seduce her, as you will, but even so, could she be held entirely blameless? Could she not haverefused, if she was so positive at the time that she was so very moral? But she had not. And as to all this, all thathe had done, had he not done all he could to help her out of it? And he had so little money, too. And was placedin such a difficult position. She was just as much to blame as he was. And yet now she was so determined todrive him this way. To insist on his marrying her, whereas if she would only go her own way--as she could withhis help--she might still save both of them all this trouble. 　　But no, she would not, and he would not marry her and that was all there was to it. She need not think that shecould make him. No, no, no! At times, when in such moods, he felt that he could do anything--drown her easilyenough, and she would only have herself to blame. 　　Then again his more cowering sense of what society would think and do, if it knew, what he himself would becompelled to think of himself afterwards, fairly well satisfied him that as much as he desired to stay, he was notthe one to do anything at all and in consequence must flee. 　　And so it was that Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday following Roberta\u0027s letter received on Monday, hadpassed. And then, on Thursday night, following a most torturesome mental day on his and Roberta\u0027s part for thatmatter, this is what he received: 　　Biltz, Wednesday, June 30th. 　　DEAR CLYDE: 　　This is to tell you that unless I hear from you either by telephone or letter before noon, Friday, I shall be inLycurgus that same night, and the world will know how you have treated me. I cannot and will not wait andsuffer one more hour. I regret to be compelled to take this step, but you have allowed all this time to go in silencereally, and Saturday is the third, and without any plans of any kind. My whole life is ruined and so will yours bein a measure, but I cannot feel that I am entirely to blame. I have done all I possibly could to make this burden aseasy for you as possible and I certainly regret all the misery it will cause my parents and friends and all whomyou know and hold dear. But I will not wait and suffer one hour more. 　　ROBERTA. 　　And with this in his hands, he was finally all but numbed by the fact that now decidedly he must act. She wasactually coming! Unless he could soothe or restrain her in some manner she would be here to-morrow--thesecond. And yet the second, or the third, or any time until after the Fourth, was no time to leave with her. Theholiday crowds would be too great. There would be too many people to see--to encounter. There must be moresecrecy. He must have at least a little more time in which to get ready. He must think now quickly and then act. 　　Great God! Get ready. Could he not telephone her and say that he had been sick or so worried on account of thenecessary money or something that he could not write--and that besides his uncle had sent for him to come toGreenwood Lake over the Fourth. His uncle! His uncle! No, that would not do. He had used his name too much,what difference should it make to him or her now, whether he saw his uncle once more or not? He was leavingonce and for all, or so he had been telling her, on her account, was he not? And so he had better say that he wasgoing to his uncle, in order to give a reason why he was going away so that, possibly, he might be able to returnin a year or so. She might believe that. At any rate he must tell her something that would quiet her until after theFourth--make her stay up there until at least he could perfect some plan--bring himself to the place where hecould do one thing or the other. One thing or the other. 　　Without pausing to plan anything more than just this at this time, he hurried to the nearest telephone where hewas least likely to be overheard. And, getting her once more, began one of those long and evasive and, in thisinstance, ingratiating explanations which eventually, after he had insisted that he had actually been sick- confined to his room with a fever and hence not able to get to a telephone--and because, as he now said, he hadfinally decided that it would be best if he were to make some explanation to his uncle, so that he might returnsome time in the future, if necessary--he, by using the most pleading, if not actually affectionate, tones andasking her to consider what a state he had been in, too, was able not only to make her believe that there was someexcuse for his delay and silence, but also to introduce the plan that he now had in mind; which was if only shecould wait until the sixth, then assuredly, without fail as to any particular, he would meet her at any place shewould choose to come--Homer, Fonda, Lycurgus, Little Falls--only since they were trying to keep everything sosecret, he would suggest that she come to Fonda on the morning of the sixth in order to make the noon train forUtica. There they could spend the night since they could not very well discuss and decide on their plans over thetelephone, now, and then they could act upon whatever they had decided. Besides he could tell her better thenjust how he thought they ought to do. He had an idea--a little trip maybe, somewhere before they got married orafter, just as she wished, but--something nice anyhow--(his voice grew husky and his knees and hands shookslightly as he said this, only Roberta could not detect the sudden perturbation within him). But she must not askhim now. He could not tell her over the phone. But as sure as anything, at noon on the sixth, he would be on thestation platform at Fonda. All she had to do after seeing him was to buy her ticket to Utica and get in one coach,and he would buy his separately and get in another--the one just ahead or behind hers. On the way down, if shedidn\u0027t see him at the station beforehand, he would pass through her car for a drink so that she could see that hewas there--no more than that--but she mustn\u0027t speak to him. Then once in Utica, she should check her bag and hewould follow her out to the nearest quiet corner. After that he would go and get her bag, and then they could goto some little hotel and he would take care of all the rest. 　　But she must do this. Would she have that much faith in him? If so, he would call her up on the third--the verynext day--and on the morning of the sixth--sure, so that both he and she would know that everything was allright--that she was starting and that he would be there. What was that? Her trunk? The little one? Sure. If sheneeded it, certainly bring it. Only, if he were she, he would not trouble to try to bring too much now, becauseonce she was settled somewhere, it would be easy enough to send for anything else that she really needed. 　　As Clyde stood at the telephone in a small outlying drug store and talked--the lonely proprietor buried in a sillyromance among his pots and phials at the back--it seemed as though the Giant Efrit that had previouslymaterialized in the silent halls of his brain, was once more here at his elbow--that he himself, cold and numb andfearsome, was being talked through--not actually talking himself. 　　Go to the lake which you visited with Sondra! 　　Get travel folders of the region there from either the Lycurgus House here or the depot. 　　Go to the south end of it and from there walk south, afterwards. 　　Pick a boat that will upset easily--one with a round bottom, such as those you have seen here at Crum Lake andup there. 　　Buy a new and different hat and leave that on the water--one that cannot be traced to you. You might even tearthe lining out of it so that it cannot be traced. 　　Pack all of your things in your trunk here, but leave it, so that swiftly, in the event that anything goes wrong, youcan return here and get it and depart. 　　And take only such things with you as will make it seem as though you were going for an outing to TwelfthLake--not away, so that should you be sought at Twelfth Lake, it will look as though you had gone only there,not elsewhere. 　　Tell her that you intend to marry her, but AFTER you return from this outing, not before. 　　And if necessary strike a light blow, so as to stun her--no more--so that falling in the water, she will drown themore easily. 　　Do not fear! 　　Do not be weak! 　　Walk through the woods by night, not by day--so that when seen again you will be in Three Mile Bay orSharon--and can say that you came from Racquette or Long Lake south, or from Lycurgus north. 　　Use a false name and alter your handwriting as much as possible. 　　Assume that you will be successful. 　　And whisper, whisper--let your language be soft, your tone tender, loving, even. It must be, if you are to win herto your will now.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16701.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
