{"id":1637,"no":29,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 10","content":"At this point a maid announced that supper was served and instantly Gilbert took his departure. At the same timethe family arose and Mrs. Griffiths asked the maid: \"Has Bella telephoned yet?\"\"No, ma\u0027am,\" replied the servant, \"not yet.\"\"Well, have Mrs. Truesdale call up the Finchleys and see if she\u0027s there. You tell her I said that she is to comehome at once.\"The maid departed for a moment while the group proceeded to the dining room, which lay to the west of thestairs at the rear. Again, as Clyde saw, this was another splendidly furnished room done in a very light brown,with a long center table of carved walnut, evidently used only for special occasions. It was surrounded by high-backed chairs and lighted by candelabras set at even spaces upon it. In a lower ceilinged and yet ample circularalcove beyond this, looking out on the garden to the south, was a smaller table set for six. It was in this alcovethat they were to dine, a different thing from what Clyde had expected for some reason.\n 　　Seated in a very placid fashion, he found himself answering questions principally as to his own family, the natureof its life, past and present; how old was his father now? His mother? What had been the places of their residencebefore moving to Denver? How many brothers and sisters had he? How old was his sister, Esta? What did shedo? And the others? Did his father like managing a hotel? What had been the nature of his father\u0027s work inKansas City? How long had the family lived there?\n 　　Clyde was not a little troubled and embarrassed by this chain of questions which flowed rather heavily andsolemnly from Samuel Griffiths or his wife. And from Clyde\u0027s hesitating replies, especially in regard to thenature of the family life in Kansas City, both gathered that he was embarrassed and troubled by some of thequestions. They laid it to the extreme poverty of their relatives, of course. For having asked, \"I suppose youbegan your hotel work in Kansas City, didn\u0027t you, after you left school?\" Clyde blushed deeply, bethinkinghimself of the incident of the stolen car and of how little real schooling he had had. Most certainly he did not likethe thought of having himself identified with hotel life in Kansas City, and more especially the Green- Davidson.\n 　　But fortunately at this moment, the door opened and Bella entered, accompanied by two girls such as Clydewould have assumed at once belonged to this world. How different to Rita and Zella with whom his thought sorecently had been disturbedly concerned. He did not know Bella, of course, until she proceeded most familiarlyto address her family. But the others--one was Sondra Finchley, so frequently referred to by Bella and hermother--as smart and vain and sweet a girl as Clyde had ever laid his eyes upon--so different to any he had everknown and so superior. She was dressed in a close-fitting tailored suit which followed her form exactly andwhich was enhanced by a small dark leather hat, pulled fetchingly low over her eyes. A leather belt of the samecolor encircled her neck. By a leather leash she led a French bull and over one arm carried a most striking coat ofblack and gray checks--not too pronounced and yet having the effect of a man\u0027s modish overcoat. To Clyde\u0027seyes she was the most adorable feminine thing he had seen in all his days. Indeed her effect on him was electric-thrilling--arousing in him a curiously stinging sense of what it was to want and not to have--to wish to win andyet to feel, almost agonizingly that he was destined not even to win a glance from her. It tortured and flusteredhim. At one moment he had a keen desire to close his eyes and shut her out--at another to look only at herconstantly--so truly was he captivated.\n 　　Yet, whether she saw him or not, she gave no sign at first, exclaiming to her dog: \"Now, Bissell, if you\u0027re notgoing to behave, I\u0027m going to take you out and tie you out there. Oh, I don\u0027t believe I can stay a moment if hewon\u0027t behave better than this.\" He had seen a family cat and was tugging to get near her.\n 　　Beside her was another girl whom Clyde did not fancy nearly so much, and yet who, after her fashion, was assmart as Sondra and perhaps as alluring to some. She was blonde--tow-headed--with clear almond-shaped,greenish-gray eyes, a small, graceful, catlike figure, and a slinky feline manner. At once, on entering, she sidledacross the room to the end of the table where Mrs. Griffiths sat and leaning over her at once began to purr.\n 　　\"Oh, how are you, Mrs. Griffiths? I\u0027m so glad to see you again. It\u0027s been some time since I\u0027ve been over here,hasn\u0027t it? But then Mother and I have been away. She and Grant are over at Albany to-day. And I just picked upBella and Sondra here at the Lamberts\u0027. You\u0027re just having a quiet little supper by yourselves, aren\u0027t you? Howare you, Myra?\" she called, and reaching over Mrs. Griffiths\u0027 shoulder touched Myra quite casually on the arm,as though it were more a matter of form than anything else.\n 　　In the meantime Bella, who next to Sondra seemed to Clyde decidedly the most charming of the three, wasexclaiming: \"Oh, I\u0027m late. Sorry, Mamma and Daddy. Won\u0027t that do this time?\" Then noting Clyde, and asthough for the first time, although he had risen as they entered and was still standing, she paused in semi-mockmodesty as did the others. And Clyde, oversensitive to just such airs and material distinctions, was fairlytremulous with a sense of his own inadequacy, as he waited to be introduced. For to him, youth and beauty insuch a station as this represented the ultimate triumph of the female. His weakness for Hortense Briggs, to say nothing of Rita, who was not so attractive as either of these, illustrated the effect of trim femininity on him,regardless of merit.\n 　　\"Bella,\" observed Samuel Griffiths, heavily, noting Clyde still standing, \"your cousin, Clyde.\"\"Oh, yes,\" replied Bella, observing that Clyde looked exceedingly like Gilbert. \"How are you? Mother has beensaying that you were coming to call one of these days.\" She extended a finger or two, then turned toward herfriends. \"My friends, Miss Finchley and Miss Cranston, Mr. Griffiths.\"The two girls bowed, each in the most stiff and formal manner, at the same time studying Clyde most carefullyand rather directly, \"Well, he does look like Gil a lot, doesn\u0027t he?\" whispered Sondra to Bertine, who had drawnnear to her. And Bertine replied: \"I never saw anything like it. He\u0027s really better-looking, isn\u0027t he-- a lot?\"Sondra nodded, pleased to note in the first instance that he was somewhat better-looking than Bella\u0027s brother,whom she did not like--next that he was obviously stricken with her, which was her due, as she invariablydecided in connection with youths thus smitten with her. But having thus decided, and seeing that his glance waspersistently and helplessly drawn to her, she concluded that she need pay no more attention to him, for thepresent anyway. He was too easy.\n 　　But now Mrs. Griffiths, who had not anticipated this visitation and was a little irritated with Bella for introducingher friends at this time since it at once raised the question of Clyde\u0027s social position here, observed: \"Hadn\u0027t youtwo better lay off your coats and sit down? I\u0027ll just have Nadine lay extra plates at this end. Bella, you can sitnext to your father.\"\"Oh, no, not at all,\" and \"No, indeed, we\u0027re just on our way home ourselves. I can\u0027t stay a minute,\" came fromSondra and Bertine. But now that they were here and Clyde had proved to be as attractive as he was, they wereperversely interested to see what, if any, social flair there was to him. Gilbert Griffiths, as both knew, was farfrom being popular in some quarters--their own in particular, however much they might like Bella. He was, fortwo such self-centered beauties as these, too aggressive, self-willed and contemptuous at times. Whereas Clyde,if one were to judge by his looks, at least was much more malleable. And if it were to prove now that he was ofequal station, or that the Griffiths thought so, decidedly he would be available locally, would he not? At any rate,it would be interesting to know whether he was rich. But this thought was almost instantly satisfied by Mrs.\n 　　Griffiths, who observed rather definitely and intentionally to Bertine: \"Mr. Griffiths is a nephew of ours from theWest who has come on to see if he can make a place for himself in my husband\u0027s factory. He\u0027s a young man whohas to make his own way in the world and my husband has been kind enough to give him an opportunity.\"Clyde flushed, since obviously this was a notice to him that his social position here was decidedly below that ofthe Griffiths or these girls. At the same time, as he also noticed, the look of Bertine Cranston, who was onlyinterested in youths of means and position, changed from one of curiosity to marked indifference. On the otherhand, Sondra Finchley, by no means so practical as her friend, though of a superior station in her set, since shewas so very attractive and her parents possessed of even more means--re-surveyed Clyde with one thoughtwritten rather plainly on her face, that it was too bad. He really was so attractive.\n 　　At the same time Samuel Griffiths, having a peculiar fondness for Sondra, if not Bertine, whom Mrs. Griffiths also disliked as being too tricky and sly, was calling to her: \"Here, Sondra, tie up your dog to one of the dining-room chairs and come and sit by me. Throw your coat over that chair. Here\u0027s room for you.\" He motioned to herto come.\n 　　\"But I can\u0027t, Uncle Samuel!\" called Sondra, familiarly and showily and yet somehow sweetly, seeking toingratiate herself by this affected relationship. \"We\u0027re late now. Besides Bissell won\u0027t behave. Bertine and I arejust on our way home, truly.\"\"Oh, yes, Papa,\" put in Bella, quickly, \"Bertine\u0027s horse ran a nail in his foot yesterday and is going lame to-day.\n 　　And neither Grant nor his father is home. She wants to know if you know anything that\u0027s good for it.\"\"Which foot is it?\" inquired Griffiths, interested, while Clyde continued to survey Sondra as best he might. Shewas so delicious, he thought--her nose so tiny and tilted--her upper lip arched so roguishly upward toward hernose.\n 　　\"It\u0027s the left fore. I was riding out on the East Kingston road yesterday afternoon. Jerry threw a shoe and musthave picked up a splinter, but John doesn\u0027t seem to be able to find it.\"\"Did you ride him much with the nail, do you think?\"\"About eight miles--all the way back.\"\"Well, you had better have John put on some liniment and a bandage and call a veterinary. He\u0027ll come around allright, I\u0027m sure.\"The group showed no signs of leaving and Clyde, left quite to himself for the moment, was thinking what aneasy, delightful world this must be--this local society. For here they were without a care, apparently, between anyof them. All their talk was of houses being built, horses they were riding, friends they had met, places they weregoing to, things they were going to do. And there was Gilbert, who had left only a little while before--motoringsomewhere with a group of young men. And Bella, his cousin, trifling around with these girls in the beautifulhomes of this street, while he was shunted away in a small third-floor room at Mrs. Cuppy\u0027s with no place to go.\n 　　And with only fifteen dollars a week to live on. And in the morning he would be working in the basement again,while these girls were rising to more pleasure. And out in Denver were his parents with their small lodging houseand mission, which he dared not even describe accurately here.\n 　　Suddenly the two girls declaring they must go, they took themselves off. And he and the Griffiths were oncemore left to themselves--he with the feeling that he was very much out of place and neglected here, sinceSamuel Griffiths and his wife and Bella, anyhow, if not Myra, seemed to be feeling that he was merely beingpermitted to look into a world to which he did not belong; also, that because of his poverty it would beimpossible to fit him into--however much he might dream of associating with three such wonderful girls asthese. And at once he felt sad--very--his eyes and his mood darkening so much that not only Samuel Griffiths,but his wife as well as Myra noticed it. If he could enter upon this world, find some way. But of the group it wasonly Myra, not any of the others, who sensed that in all likelihood he was lonely and depressed. And inconsequence as all were rising and returning to the large living room (Samuel chiding Bella for her habit of keeping her family waiting) it was Myra who drew near to Clyde to say: \"I think after you\u0027ve been here a littlewhile you\u0027ll probably like Lycurgus better than you do now, even. There are quite a number of interesting placesto go and see around here--lakes and the Adirondacks are just north of here, about seventy miles. And when thesummer comes and we get settled at Greenwood, I\u0027m sure Father and Mother will like you to come up there oncein a while.\"She was by no means sure that this was true, but under the circumstances, whether it was or not, she felt likesaying it to Clyde. And thereafter, since he felt more comfortable with her, he talked with her as much as hecould without neglecting either Bella or the family, until about half-past nine, when, suddenly feeling very muchout of place and alone, he arose saying that he must go, that he had to get up early in the morning. And as he didso, Samuel Griffiths walked with him to the front door and let him out. But he, too, by now, as had Myra beforehim, feeling that Clyde was rather attractive and yet, for reasons of poverty, likely to be neglected from now on,not only by his family, but by himself as well, observed most pleasantly, and, as he hoped, compensatively: \"It\u0027srather nice out, isn\u0027t it? Wykeagy Avenue hasn\u0027t begun to show what it can do yet because the spring isn\u0027t quitehere. But in a few weeks,\" and he looked up most inquiringly at the sky and sniffed the late April air, \"we musthave you out. All the trees and flowers will be in bloom then and you can see how really nice it is. Good night.\"He smiled and put a very cordial note into his voice, and once more Clyde felt that, whatever Gilbert Griffiths\u0027\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16666.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
