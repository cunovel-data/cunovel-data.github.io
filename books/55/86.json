{"id":1694,"no":86,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 20","content":"And then five entire days consumed by Mason and Belknap in selecting a jury. But at last the twelve men whowere to try Clyde, sworn and seated. And such men--odd and grizzled, or tanned and wrinkled, farmers andcountry storekeepers, with here and there a Ford agent, a keeper of an inn at Tom Dixon\u0027s Lake, a salesman inHamburger\u0027s dry goods store at Bridgeburg, and a peripatetic insurance agent residing in Purday just north ofGrass Lake. And with but one exception, all married. And with but one exception, all religious, if not moral, andall convinced of Clyde\u0027s guilt before ever they sat down, but still because of their almost unanimous conceptionof themselves as fair and open-minded men, and because they were so interested to sit as jurors in this excitingcase, convinced that they could pass fairly and impartially on the facts presented to them.\n 　　And so, all rising and being sworn in.\n 　　And at once Mason rising and beginning: \"Gentlemen of the jury.\"And Clyde, as well as Belknap and Jephson, now gazing at them and wondering what the impression of Mason\u0027sopening charge was likely to be. For a more dynamic and electric prosecutor under these particularcircumstances was not to be found. This was his opportunity. Were not the eyes of all the citizens of the UnitedStates upon him? He believed so. It was as if some one had suddenly exclaimed: \"Lights! Camera!\"\"No doubt many of you have been wearied, as well as puzzled, at times during the past week,\" he began, \"by theexceeding care with which the lawyers in this case have passed upon the panels from which you twelve menhave been chosen. It has been no light matter to find twelve men to whom all the marshaled facts in thisastonishing cause could be submitted and by them weighed with all the fairness and understanding which the lawcommands. For my part, the care which I have exercised, gentlemen, has been directed by but one motive--thatthe state shall have justice done. No malice, no pre-conceived notions of any kind. So late as July 9th last Ipersonally was not even aware of the existence of this defendant, nor of his victim, nor of the crime with whichhe is now charged. But, gentlemen, as shocked and unbelieving as I was at first upon hearing that a man of theage, training and connections of the defendant here could have placed himself in a position to be accused of suchan offense, step by step I was compelled to alter and then dismiss forever from my mind my original doubts andto conclude from the mass of evidence that was literally thrust upon me, that it was my duty to prosecute thisaction in behalf of the people.\n 　　\"But, however that may be, let us proceed to the facts. There are two women in this action. One is dead. Theother\" (and he now turned toward where Clyde sat, and here he pointed a finger in the direction of Belknap andJephson), \"by agreement between the prosecution and the defense is to be nameless here, since no good cancome from inflicting unnecessary injury. In fact, the sole purpose which I now announce to you to be behindevery word and every fact as it will be presented by the prosecution is that exact justice, according to the laws ofthis state and the crime with which this defendant is charged, shall be done. EXACT JUSTICE, gentlemen, exact and fair. But if you do not act honestly and render a true verdict according to the evidence, the people of the stateof New York and the people of the county of Cataraqui will have a grievance and a serious one. For it is theywho are looking to you for a true accounting for your reasoning and your final decision in this case.\"And here Mason paused, and then turning dramatically toward Clyde, and with his right index finger pointingtoward him at times, continued: \"The people of the state of New York CHARGE,\" (and he hung upon this oneword as though he desired to give it the value of rolling thunder), \"that the crime of murder in the first degree hasbeen committed by the prisoner at the bar--Clyde Griffiths. They CHARGE that he willfully, and with maliceand cruelty and deception, murdered and then sought to conceal forever from the knowledge and the justice ofthe world, the body of Roberta Alden, the daughter of a farmer who has for years resided near the village ofBiltz, in Mimico County. They CHARGE\" (and here Clyde, because of whispered advice from Jephson, wasleaning back as comfortably as possible and gazing as imperturbably as possible upon the face of Mason, whowas looking directly at him) \"that this same Clyde Griffiths, before ever this crime was committed by him,plotted for weeks the plan and commission of it, and then, with malice aforethought and in cold blood, executedit.\n 　　\"And in charging these things, the people of the State of New York expect to, and will, produce before yousubstantiations of every one of them. You will be given facts, and of these facts you, not I, are to be the solejudge.\"And here he paused once more, and shifting to a different physical position while the eager audience crowdedand leaned forward, hungry and thirsty for every word he should utter, he now lifted one arm and dramaticallypushing back his curly hair, resumed:\n 　　\"Gentlemen, it will not take me long to picture, nor will you fail to perceive for yourselves as this case proceeds,the type of girl this was whose life was so cruelly blotted out beneath the waters of Big Bittern. All the twentyyears of her life\" (and Mason knew well that she was twenty-three and two years older than Clyde) \"no personwho ever knew her ever said one word in criticism of her character. And no evidence to that effect, I am positive,will be introduced in this trial. Somewhat over a year ago--on July 19-- she went to the city of Lycurgus, in orderthat by working with her own hands she might help her family.\" (And here the sobs of her parents and sisters andbrothers were heard throughout the courtroom.)\"Gentlemen,\" went on Mason, and from this point carrying on the picture of Roberta\u0027s life from the time she firstleft home to join Grace Marr until, having met Clyde on Crum Lake and fallen out with her friend and patrons,the Newtons, because of him, she accepted his dictum that she live alone, amid strange people, concealing thesuspicious truth of this from her parents, and then finally succumbing to his wiles--the letters she had written himfrom Biltz detailing every single progressive step in this story. And from there, by the same meticulous process,he proceeded to Clyde--his interest in the affairs of Lycurgus society and the rich and beautiful Miss X, whobecause of a purely innocent and kindly, if infatuated, indication on her part that he might hope to aspire to herhand--had unwittingly evoked in him a passion which had been the cause of the sudden change in his attitude andemotions toward Roberta, resulting, as Mason insisted he would show, in the plot that had resulted in Roberta\u0027sdeath.\n 　　\"But who is the individual,\" he suddenly and most dramatically exclaimed at this point, \"against whom I charge all these things? There he sits! Is he the son of wastrel parents--a product of the slums--one who had been deniedevery opportunity for a proper or honorable conception of the values and duties of a decent and respectable life?\n 　　Is he? On the contrary. His father is of the same strain that has given Lycurgus one of its largest and mostconstructive industries--the Griffiths Collar \u0026 Shirt Company. He was poor--yes--no doubt of that. But not moreso than Roberta Alden--and her character appears not to have been affected by her poverty. His parents in KansasCity, Denver, and before that Chicago and Grand Rapids, Michigan, appear to have been unordained ministers ofthe proselytizing and mission-conducting type-people who, from all I can gather, are really, sincerely religiousand right-principled in every sense. But this, their oldest son, and the one who might have been expected to bedeeply influenced by them, early turned from their world and took to a more garish life. He became a bell-boy ina celebrated Kansas City hotel, the Green- Davidson.\"And now he proceeded to explain that Clyde had ever been a rolling stone--one who, by reason of some quirk oftemperament, perhaps, preferred to wander here and there. Later, as he now explained, he had been given animportant position as head of a department in the well-known factory of his uncle at Lycurgus. And thengradually he was introduced into the circles in which his uncle and his children were familiar. And his salary wassuch that he could afford to keep a room in one of the better residences of the city, while the girl he had slainlived in a mean room in a back street.\n 　　\"And yet,\" he continued, \"how much has been made here of the alleged youth of this defendant?\" (Here hepermitted himself a scornful smile.) \"He has been called by his counsel and others in the newspapers a boy, overand over again. He is not a boy. He is a bearded man. He has had more social and educational advantages thanany one of you in the jury box. He has traveled. In hotels and clubs and the society with which he was sointimately connected in Lycurgus, he has been in contact with decent, respectable, and even able anddistinguished people. Why, as a matter of fact, at the time of his arrest two months ago, he was part of as smart asociety and summer resort group as this region boasts. Remember that! His mind is a mature, not, an immatureone. It is fully developed and balanced perfectly.\n 　　\"Gentlemen, as the state will soon proceed to prove,\" he went on, \"it was no more than four months after hisarrival in Lycurgus that this dead girl came to work for the defendant in the department of which he was thehead. And it was not more than two months after that before he had induced her to move from the respectableand religious home which she had chosen in Lycurgus, to one concerning which she knew nothing and theprincipal advantage of which, as he saw it, was that it offered secrecy and seclusion and freedom fromobservation for that vile purpose which already he entertained in regard to her.\n 　　\"There was a rule of the Griffiths Company, as we will later show in this trial, which explains much--and thatwas that no superior officer or head of any department was permitted to have anything to do with any girlsworking under him, or for the factory, in or out of the factory. It was not conducive to either the morals or thehonor of those working for this great company, and they would not allow it. And shortly after coming there, thisman had been instructed as to that rule. But did that deter him? Did the so recent and favorable consideration ofhis uncle in any way deter him? Not in the least. Secrecy! Secrecy! From the very beginning! Seduction!\n 　　Seduction! The secret and intended and immoral and illegal and socially unwarranted and condemned use of herbody outside the regenerative and ennobling pale of matrimony!\n 　　\"That was his purpose, gentlemen! But was it generally known by any one in Lycurgus or elsewhere that such a relationship as this existed between him and Roberta Alden? Not a soul! NOT A SOUL!, as far as I have beenable to ascertain, was ever so much as partially aware of this relationship until after this girl was dead. Not asoul! Think of that!\n 　　\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" and here his voice took on an almost reverential tone, \"Roberta Alden loved thisdefendant with all the strength of her soul. She loved him with that love which is the crowning mystery of thehuman brain and the human heart, that transcends in its strength and its weakness all fear of shame orpunishment from even the immortal throne above. She was a true and human and decent and kindly girl--apassionate and loving girl. And she loved as only a generous and trusting and self-sacrificing soul can love. Andloving so, in the end she gave to him all that any woman can give the man she loves.\n 　　\"Friends, this thing has happened millions of times in this world of ours, and it will happen millions and millionsof times in the days to come. It is not new and it will never be old.\n 　　\"But in January or February last, this girl, who is now dead in her grave, was compelled to come to thisdefendant, Clyde Griffiths, and tell him that she was about to become a mother. We shall prove to you that thenand later she begged him to go away with her and make her his wife.\n 　　\"But did he? Would he? Oh, no! For by that time a change had come over the dreams and the affections of ClydeGriffiths. He had had time to discover that the name of Griffiths in Lycurgus was one that would open the doorsof Lycurgus exclusive circles--that the man who was no one in Kansas City or Chicago--was very much of aperson here, and that it would bring him in contact with girls of education and means, girls who moved far fromthe sphere to which Roberta Alden belonged. Not only that, but he had found one girl to whom, because of herbeauty, wealth, position, he had become enormously attached and beside her the little farm and factory girl in thepathetically shabby and secret room to which he had assigned her, looked poor indeed--good enough to betraybut not good enough to marry. And he would not.\" Here he paused, but only for a moment, then went on:\n 　　\"But at no point have I been able to find the least modification or cessation of any of these social activities on hispart which so entranced him. On the contrary, from January to July fifth last, and after--yes, even after she wasfinally compelled to say to him that unless he could take her away and marry her, she would have to appeal to thesense of justice in the community in which they moved, and after she was cold and dead under the waters of BigBittern--dances, lawn fetes, automobile parties, dinners, gay trips to Twelfth Lake and Bear Lake, and without athought, seemingly, that her great moral and social need should modify his conduct in any way.\"And here he paused and gazed in the direction of Belknap and Jephson, who in turn, were not sufficientlydisturbed or concerned to do more than smile, first at him and then at each other, although Clyde, terrorized bythe force and the vehemence of it all, was chiefly concerned to note how much of exaggeration and unfairnesswas in all this.\n 　　But even as he was thinking so, Mason was continuing with: \"But by this time, gentlemen, as I have indicated,Roberta Alden had become insistent that Griffiths make her his wife. And this he promised to do. Yet, as all theevidence here will show, he never intended to do anything of the kind. On the contrary, when her conditionbecame such that he could no longer endure her pleas or the danger which her presence in Lycurgusunquestionably spelled for him, he induced her to go home to her father\u0027s house, with the suggestion, apparently, that she prepare herself by making some necessary clothes, against the day when he would come for her andremove her to some distant city where they would not be known, yet where as his wife she could honorably bringtheir child into the world. And according to her letters to him, as I will show, that was to have been in threeweeks from the time she departed for her home in Biltz. But did he come for her as he had promised? No, henever did.\n 　　\"Eventually, and solely because there was no other way out, he permitted her to come to him--on July sixth last-exactlytwo days before her death. But not before--but wait!--In the meantime, or from June fifth to July sixth,he allowed her to brood in that little, lonely farm-house on the outskirts of Biltz in Mimico County, with theneighbors coming in to watch and help her make some clothes, which even then she did not dare announce as herbridal trousseau. And she suspected and feared that this defendant would fail her. For daily, and sometimes twicedaily, she wrote him, telling him of her fears and asking him to assure her by letter or word in some form that hewould come and take her away.\n 　　\"But did he even do that? Never by letter! NEVER! Oh, no, gentlemen, oh, no! On the contrary some telephonemessages--things that could not be so easily traced or understood. And these so few and brief that she herselfcomplained bitterly of his lack of interest and consideration for her at this time. So much so that at the end of fiveweeks, growing desperate, she wrote\" (and here Mason picked from a collection of letters on the table behindhim a particular letter, and read): \"\u0027This is to tell you that unless I hear from you either by telephone or letterbefore noon Friday, I will come to Lycurgus and the world will know how you have treated me.\u0027 Those are thewords, gentlemen, that this poor girl was at last compelled to write.\n 　　\"But did Clyde Griffiths want the world to know how he had treated her? Of course not! And there and thenbegan to form in his mind a plan by which he could escape exposure and seal Roberta Alden\u0027s lips forever. And,gentlemen, the state will prove that he did so close her mouth.\"At this point Mason produced a map of the Adirondacks which he had had made for the purpose, and on whichin red ink were traced the movements of Clyde up to and after her death--up to the time of his arrest at Big Bear.\n 　　Also, in doing this, he paused to tell the jury of Clyde\u0027s well-conceived plan of hiding his identity, the variousfalse registrations, the two hats. Here also he explained that on the train between Fonda and Utica, as againbetween Utica and Grass Lake, he had not ridden in the same car with Roberta. And then he announced:\n 　　\"Don\u0027t forget, gentlemen, that although he had previously indicated to Roberta that this was to be their weddingjourney, he did not want anybody to know that he was with his prospective bride--no, not even after they hadreached Big Bittern. For he was seeking, not to marry but to find a wilderness in which to snuff out the life ofthis girl of whom he had tired. But did that prevent him, twenty-four and forty-eight hours before that time, fromholding her in his arms and repeating the promises he had no intention of keeping? Did it? I will show you theregisters of the two hotels in which they stayed, and where, because of their assumed approaching marriage, theyoccupied a single room together. Yet the only reason it was forty-eight instead of twenty-four hours was that hehad made a mistake in regard to the solitude of Grass Lake. Finding it brisk with life, the center of a summerreligious colony, he decided to leave and go to Big Bittern, which was more lonely. And so you have theastounding and bitter spectacle, gentlemen, of a supposedly innocent and highly misunderstood young mandragging this weary and heart-sick girl from place to place, in order to find a lake deserted enough in which todrown her. And with her but four months from motherhood!\n 　　\"And then, having arrived at last at one lake lonely enough, putting her in a boat and taking her out from the innwhere he had again falsely registered as Mr. Clifford Golden and wife, to her death. The poor little thingimagined that she was going for a brief outing before that marriage of which he talked and which was to seal andsanctify it. To seal and sanctify it! To seal and sanctify, as closing waters seal and sanctify, but in no other way-noother way. And with him walking, whole and sly--as a wolf from its kill--to freedom, to marriage, to socialand material and affectionate bliss and superiority and ease, while she slept still and nameless in her waterygrave.\n 　　\"But, oh, gentlemen, the ways of nature, or of God, and the Providence that shapes our ends, rough-hew themhow we may! It is man who proposes, but God--God--who disposes!\n 　　\"The defendant is still wondering, I am sure, as to how I know that she thought she was still going to be marriedafter leaving the inn at Big Bittern. And I have no doubt that he still has some comforting thoughts to the effectthat I cannot really and truly know it. But how shrewd and deep must be that mind that would foresee andforestall all the accidents and chances of life. For, as he sits there now, secure in the faith that his counsel may beable to extract him safely from this\" (and at this Clyde sat bolt upright, his hair tingling, and his hands concealedbeneath the table, trembling slightly), \"he does not know that that girl, while in her room in the Grass Lake Inn,had written her mother a letter, which she had not had time to mail, and which was in the pocket of her coat leftbehind because of the heat of the day, and because she imagined she was coming back, of course. And which ishere now upon this table.\"At this Clyde\u0027s teeth fairly chattered. He shook as with a chill. To be sure, she had left her coat behind! AndBelknap and Jephson also sat up, wondering what this could be. How fatally, if at all, could it mar or makeimpossible the plan of defense which they had evolved? They could only wait and see.\n 　　\"But in that letter,\" went on Mason, \"she tells why she was up there--to be married, no less\" (and at this pointJephson and Belknap, as well as Clyde, heaved an enormous sigh of relief--it was directly in the field of theirplan) \"and within a day or two,\" continued Mason, thinking still that he was literally riddling Clyde with fear.\n 　　\"But Griffiths, or Graham, of Albany, or Syracuse, or anywhere, knew better. He knew he was not coming back.\n 　　And he took all of his belongings with him in that boat. And all afternoon long, from noon until evening, hesearched for a spot on that lonely lake--a spot not easily observed from any point of the shore, as we will show.\n 　　And as evening fell, he found it. And walking south through the woods afterwards, with a new straw hat upon hishead, a clean, dry bag in his hand, he imagined himself to be secure. Clifford Golden was no more--Carl Grahamwas no more--drowned--at the bottom of Big Bittern, along with Roberta Alden. But Clyde Griffiths was aliveand free, and on his way to Twelfth Lake, to the society he so loved.\n 　　\"Gentlemen, Clyde Griffiths killed Roberta Alden before he put her in that lake. He beat her on the head andface, and he believed no eye saw him. But, as her last death cry rang out over the water of Big Bittern, there wasa witness, and before the prosecution has closed its case, that witness will be here to tell you the story.\"Mason had no eye witness, but he could not resist this opportunity to throw so disrupting a thought into theopposition camp.\n 　　And decidedly, the result was all that he expected, and more. For Clyde, who up to this time and particularlysince the thunderbolt of the letter, had been seeking to face it all with an imperturbable look of patient innocence,now stiffened and then wilted. A witness! And here to testify! God! Then he, whoever he was, lurking on thelone shore of the lake, had seen the unintended blow, had heard her cries--had seen that he had not sought to aidher! Had seen him swim to shore and steal away--maybe had watched him in the woods as he changed hisclothes. God! His hands now gripped the sides of the chair, and his head went back with a jerk as if from apowerful blow, for that meant death--his sure execution. God! No hope now! His head dropped and he looked asthough he might lapse into a state of coma.\n 　　As to Belknap, Mason\u0027s revelation at first caused him to drop the pencil with which he was making notes, thennext to stare in a puzzled and dumbfounded way, since they had no evidence wherewith to forefend against sucha smash as this--But as instantly recalling how completely off his guard he must look, recovering. Could it bethat Clyde might have been lying to them, after all--that he had killed her intentionally, and before this unseenwitness? If so it might be necessary for them to withdraw from such a hopeless and unpopular case, after all.\n 　　As for Jephson, he was for the moment stunned and flattened. And through his stern and not easily shakablebrain raced such thoughts as--was there really a witness?--has Clyde lied?--then the die was cast, for had he notalready admitted to them that he had struck Roberta, and the witness must have seen that? And so the end of anyplea of a change of heart. Who would believe that, after such testimony as this?\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16838.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
