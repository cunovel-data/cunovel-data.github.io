{"id":1651,"no":43,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 24","content":"The effect of this so casual contact was really disrupting in more senses than one. For now in spite of his comfortin and satisfaction with Roberta, once more and in this positive and to him entrancing way, was posed the wholequestion of his social possibilities here. And that strangely enough by the one girl of this upper level who hadmost materialized and magnified for him the meaning of that upper level itself. The beautiful Sondra Finchley!\\n\\n 　　Her lovely face, smart clothes, gay and superior demeanor! If only at the time he had first encountered her he hadmanaged to interest her. Or could now.\\n\\n 　　The fact that his relations with Roberta were what they were now was not of sufficient import or weight to offsetthe temperamental or imaginative pull of such a girl as Sondra and all that she represented. Just to think theWimblinger Finchley Electric Sweeper Company was one of the largest manufacturing concerns here. Its tallwalls and stacks made a part of the striking sky line across the Mohawk. And the Finchley residence in WykeagyAvenue, near that of the Griffiths, was one of the most impressive among that distinguished row of houses whichhad come with the latest and most discriminating architectural taste here--Italian Renaissance--cream huedmarble and Dutchess County sandstone combined. And the Finchleys were among the most discussed of familieshere.\\n\\n 　　Ah, to know this perfect girl more intimately! To be looked upon by her with favor,--made, by reason of thatfavor, a part of that fine world to which she belonged. Was he not a Griffiths--as good looking as Gilbert Griffiths any day? And as attractive if he only had as much money--or a part of it even. To be able to dress in theGilbert Griffiths\u0027 fashion; to ride around in one of the handsome cars he sported! Then, you bet, a girl like thiswould be delighted to notice him,--mayhap, who knows, even fall in love with him. Analschar and the tray ofglasses. But now, as he gloomily thought, he could only hope, hope, hope.\\n\\n 　　The devil! He would not go around to Roberta\u0027s this evening. He would trump up some excuse--tell her in themorning that he had been called upon by his uncle or cousin to do some work. He could not and would not go,feeling as he did just now.\\n\\n 　　So much for the effect of wealth, beauty, the peculiar social state to which he most aspired, on a temperamentthat was as fluid and unstable as water.\\n\\n 　　On the other hand, later, thinking over her contact with Clyde, Sondra was definitely taken with what may onlybe described as his charm for her, all the more definite in this case since it represented a direct opposite to all thathis cousin offered by way of offense. His clothes and his manner, as well as a remark he had dropped, to theeffect that he was connected with the company in some official capacity, seemed to indicate that he might bebetter placed than she had imagined. Yet she also recalled that although she had been about with Bella allsummer and had encountered Gilbert, Myra and their parents from time to time, there had never been a wordabout Clyde. Indeed all the information she had gathered concerning him was that originally furnished by Mrs.\\n\\n 　　Griffiths, who had said that he was a poor nephew whom her husband had brought on from the west in order tohelp in some way. Yet now, as she viewed Clyde on this occasion, he did not seem so utterly unimportant orpoverty-stricken by any means--quite interesting and rather smart and very attractive, and obviously anxious tobe taken seriously by a girl like herself, as she could see. And this coming from Gilbert\u0027s cousin--a Griffiths--wasflattering.\\n\\n 　　Arriving at the Trumbull\u0027s, a family which centered about one Douglas Trumbull, a prosperous lawyer andwidower and speculator of this region, who, by reason of his children as well as his own good manners and legalsubtlety, had managed to ingratiate himself into the best circles of Lycurgus society, she suddenly confided to JillTrumbull, the elder of the lawyer\u0027s two daughters: \"You know I had a funny experience to-day.\" And sheproceeded to relate all that had occurred in detail. Afterward at dinner, Jill having appeared to find it mostfascinating, she again repeated it to Gertrude and Tracy, the younger daughter and only son of the Trumbullfamily.\\n\\n 　　\"Oh, yes,\" observed Tracy Trumbull, a law student in his father\u0027s office, \"I\u0027ve seen that fellow, I bet, three or fourtimes on Central Avenue. He looks a lot like Gil, doesn\u0027t he? Only not so swagger. I\u0027ve nodded to him two orthree times this summer because I thought he was Gil for the moment.\"\"Oh, I\u0027ve seen him, too,\" commented Gertrude Trumbull. \"He wears a cap and a belted coat like Gilbert Griffiths,sometimes, doesn\u0027t he? Arabella Stark pointed him out to me once and then Jill and I saw him passing Stark\u0027sonce on a Saturday afternoon. He is better looking than Gil, any day, I think.\"This confirmed Sondra in her own thoughts in regard to Clyde and now she added: \"Bertine Cranston and I methim one evening last spring at the Griffiths\u0027. We thought he was too bashful, then. But I wish you could see himnow--he\u0027s positively handsome, with the softest eyes and the nicest smile.\"\"Oh, now, Sondra,\" commented Jill Trumbull, who, apart from Bertine and Bella, was as close to Sondra as anygirl here, having been one of her classmates at the Snedeker School, \"I know some one who would be jealous ifhe could hear you say that.\"\"And wouldn\u0027t Gil Griffiths like to hear that his cousin\u0027s better looking than he is?\" chimed in Tracy Trumbull.\\n\\n 　　\"Oh, say--\"\"Oh, he,\" sniffed Sondra irritably. \"He thinks he\u0027s so much. I\u0027ll bet anything it\u0027s because of him that the Griffithswon\u0027t have anything to do with their cousin. I\u0027m sure of it, now that I think of it. Bella would, of course, becauseI heard her say last spring that she thought he was good-looking. And Myra wouldn\u0027t do anything to hurtanybody. What a lark if some of us were to take him up some time and begin inviting him here and there--oncein a while, you know--just for fun, to see how he would do. And how the Griffiths would take it. I know wellenough it would be all right with Mr. Griffiths and Myra and Bella, but Gil I\u0027ll bet would be as peeved asanything. I couldn\u0027t do it myself very well, because I\u0027m so close to Bella, but I know who could and they couldn\u0027tsay a thing.\" She paused, thinking of Bertine Cranston and how she disliked Gil and Mrs. Griffiths. \"I wonder ifhe dances or rides or plays tennis or anything like that?\" She stopped and meditated amusedly, the while theothers studied her. And Jill Trumbull, a restless, eager girl like herself, without so much of her looks or flair,however, observed: \"It would be a prank, wouldn\u0027t it? Do you suppose the Griffiths really would dislike it verymuch?\"\"What\u0027s the difference if they did?\" went on Sondra. \"They couldn\u0027t do anything more than ignore him, couldthey? And who would care about that, I\u0027d like to know. Not the people who invited him.\"\"Go on, you fellows, stir up a local scrap, will you?\" put in Tracy Trumbull. \"I\u0027ll bet anything that\u0027s what comesof it in the end. Gil Griffiths won\u0027t like it, you can gamble on that. I wouldn\u0027t if I were in his position. If you wantto stir up a lot of feeling here, go to it, but I\u0027ll lay a bet that\u0027s what it comes to.\"Now Sondra Finchley\u0027s nature was of just such a turn that a thought of this kind was most appealing to her.\\n\\n 　　However, as interesting as the idea was to her at the time, nothing definite might have come of it, had it not beenthat subsequent to this conversation and several others held with Bertine Cranston, Jill Trumbull, PatriciaAnthony, and Arabella Stark, the news of this adventure, together with some comments as to himself, finallycame to the ears of Gilbert Griffiths, yet only via Constance Wynant to whom, as local gossips would have it, hewas prospectively engaged. And Constance, hoping that Gilbert would marry her eventually, was herself irritatedby the report that Sondra had chosen to interest herself in Clyde, and then, for no sane reason, as she saw it,proclaim that he was more attractive than Gilbert. So, as much to relieve herself as to lay some plan of avengingherself upon Sondra, if possible, she conveyed the whole matter in turn to Gilbert, who at once proceeded tomake various cutting references to Clyde and Sondra. And these carried back to Sondra, along with certainembellishments by Constance, had the desired effect. It served to awaken in her the keenest desire for retaliation.\\n\\n 　　For if she chose she certainly could be nice to Clyde, and have others be nice to him, too. And that would meanperhaps that Gilbert would find himself faced by a social rival of sorts--his own cousin, too, who, even though hewas poor, might come to be liked better. What a lark! At the very same time there came to her a way by whichshe might most easily introduce Clyde, and yet without seeming so to do, and without any great harm to herself,if it did not terminate as she wished.\\n\\n 　　For in Lycurgus among the younger members of those smarter families whose children had been to the SnedekerSchool, existed a rather illusory and casual dinner and dance club called the \"Now and Then.\" It had no definiteorganization, officers or abode. Any one, who, because of class and social connections was eligible and chose tobelong, could call a meeting of other members to give a dinner or dance or tea in their homes.\\n\\n 　　And how simple, thought Sondra in browsing around for a suitable vehicle by which to introduce Clyde, if someone other than herself who belonged could be induced to get up something and then at her suggestion inviteClyde. How easy, say, for Jill Trumbull to give a dinner and dance to the \"Now and Thens,\" to which Clydemight be invited. And by this ruse she would thus be able to see him again and find out just how much he didinterest her and what he was like.\\n\\n 　　Accordingly a small dinner for this club and its friends was announced for the first Thursday in December, JillTrumbull to be the hostess. To it were to be invited Sondra and her brother, Stuart, Tracy and Gertrude Trumbull,Arabella Stark, Bertine and her brother, and some others from Utica and Gloversville as well. And Clyde. But inorder to safeguard Clyde against any chance of failure or even invidious comment of any kind, not only she butBertine and Jill and Gertrude were to be attentive to and considerate of him. They were to see that his danceprogram was complete and that neither at dinner nor on the dance floor was he to be left to himself, but was to bepassed on most artfully from one to the other until evening should be over. For, by reason of that, others mightcome to be interested in him, which would not only take the thorn from the thought that Sondra alone, of all thebetter people of Lycurgus, had been friendly to him, but would sharpen the point of this development for Gilbert,if not for Bella and the other members of the Griffiths family.\\n\\n 　　And in accordance with this plan, so it was done.\\n\\n 　　And so it was that Clyde, returning from the factory one early December evening about two weeks after hisencounter with Sondra, was surprised by the sight of a cream-colored note leaning against the mirror of hisdresser. It was addressed in a large, scrawly and unfamiliar hand. He picked it up and turned it over withoutbeing able in any way to fix upon the source. On the back were the initials B. T. or J. T., he could not decidewhich, so elaborately intertwined was the engraved penmanship. He tore it open and drew out a card which read:\\n\\n 　　The Now and Then Club Will Hold Its First Winter Dinner Dance At the Home of Douglas Trumbull 135Wykeagy Ave On Thursday, December 4 You Are Cordially Invited Will You Kindly Reply to Miss JillTrumbull?\\n\\n 　　On the back of this, though, in the same scrawly hand that graced the envelope was written: \"Dear Mr. Griffiths:\\n\\n 　　Thought you might like to come. It will be quite informal. And I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll like it. If so, will you let JillTrumbull know? Sondra Finchley.\"Quite amazed and thrilled, Clyde stood and stared. For ever since that second contact with her, he had been moredefinitely fascinated than at any time before by the dream that somehow, in some way, he was to be lifted fromthe lowly state in which he now dwelt. He was, as he now saw it, really too good for the Commonplace world bywhich he was environed. And now here was this--a social invitation issued by the \"Now and Then Club,\" ofwhich, even though he had never heard of it, must be something since it was sponsored by such exceptional people. And on the back of it, was there not the writing of Sondra herself? How marvelous, really!\\n\\n 　　So astonished was he that he could scarcely contain himself for joy, but now on the instant must walk to and fro,looking at himself in the mirror, washing his hands and face, then deciding that his tie was not just right, perhaps,and changing to another-- thinking forward to what he should wear and back upon how Sondra had looked at himon that last occasion. And how she had smiled. At the same time he could not help wondering even at thismoment of what Roberta would think, if now, by some extra optical power of observation she could note hispresent joy in connection with this note. For plainly, and because he was no longer governed by the conventionalnotions of his parents, he had been allowing himself to drift into a position in regard to her which would certainlyspell torture to her in case she should discover the nature of his present mood, a thought which puzzled him not alittle, but did not serve to modify his thoughts in regard to Sondra in the least.\\n\\n 　　That wonderful girl!\\n\\n 　　That beauty!\\n\\n 　　That world of wealth and social position she lived in!\\n\\n 　　At the same time so innately pagan and unconventional were his thoughts in regard to all this that he could nowask himself, and that seriously enough, why should he not be allowed to direct his thoughts toward her and awayfrom Roberta, since at the moment Sondra supplied the keener thought of delight. Roberta could not know aboutthis. She could not see into his mind, could she--become aware of any such extra experience as this unless hetold her. And most assuredly he did not intend to tell her. And what harm, he now asked himself, was there in apoor youth like himself aspiring to such heights? Other youths as poor as himself had married girls as rich asSondra.\\n\\n 　　For in spite of all that had occurred between him and Roberta he had not, as he now clearly recalled, given herhis word that he would marry her except under one condition. And such a condition, especially with theknowledge that he had all too clearly acquired in Kansas City, was not likely to happen as he thought.\\n\\n 　　And Sondra, now that she had thus suddenly burst upon him again in this way was the same as a fever to hisfancy. This goddess in her shrine of gilt and tinsel so utterly enticing to him, had deigned to remember him inthis open and direct way and to suggest that he be invited. And no doubt she, herself, was going to be there, athought which thrilled him beyond measure.\\n\\n 　　And what would not Gilbert and the Griffiths think if they were to hear of his going to this affair now, as theysurely would? Or meet him later at some other party to which Sondra might invite him? Think of that! Would itirritate or please them? Make them think less or more of him? For, after all, this certainly was not of his doing.\\n\\n 　　Was he not properly invited by people of their own station here in Lycurgus whom most certainly they werecompelled to respect? And by no device of his, either--sheer accident--the facts concerning which would mostcertainly not reflect on him as pushing. As lacking as he was in some of the finer shades of mentaldiscrimination, a sly and ironic pleasure lay in the thought that now Gilbert and the Griffiths might be compelledto countenance him whether they would or not--invite him to their home, even. For, if these others did, howcould they avoid it, really? Oh, joy! And that in the face of Gilbert\u0027s high contempt for him. He fairly chuckled as he thought of it, feeling that however much Gilbert might resent it, neither his uncle nor Myra were likely to, andthat hence he would be fairly safe from any secret desire on the part of Gilbert to revenge himself on him for this.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16680.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
