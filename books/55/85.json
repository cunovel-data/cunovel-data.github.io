{"id":1693,"no":85,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 19","content":"OCTOBER 15--with gray clouds and a sharp, almost January wind that herded the fallen leaves into piles andthen scurried them in crisp and windy gusts like flying birds here and there. And, in spite of the sense of struggleand tragedy in the minds of many, with an electric chair as the shadowy mental background to it all, a sense ofholiday or festival, with hundreds of farmers, woodsmen, traders, entering in Fords and Buicks--farmer wivesand husbands-- daughters and sons--even infants in arms. And then idling about the public square long before thetime for court to convene, or, as the hour neared, congregating before the county jail in the hope of obtaining aglimpse of Clyde, or before the courthouse door nearest the jail, which was to be the one entrance to thecourtroom for the public and Clyde, and from which position they could see and assure entrance into thecourtroom itself when the time came. And a flock of pigeons parading rather dismally along the cornices andgutters of the upper floor and roof of the ancient court.\n 　　And with Mason and his staff--Burton Burleigh, Earl Newcomb, Zillah Saunders, and a young Bridgeburg lawgraduate by the name of Manigault--helping to arrange the order of evidence as well as direct or instruct thevarious witnesses and venire-men who were already collecting in the antechamber of the now almost nationallyknown attorney for the people. And with cries outside of: \"Peanuts!\" \"Popcorn!\" \"Hot dogs!\" \"Get the story ofClyde Griffiths, with all the letters of Roberta Alden. Only twenty-five cents!\" (This being a set of duplicatecopies of Roberta\u0027s letters which had been stolen from Mason\u0027s office by an intimate of Burton Burleigh\u0027s and byhim sold to a penny-dreadful publisher of Binghamton, who immediately issued them in pamphlet form togetherwith an outline of \"the great plot\" and Roberta\u0027s and Clyde\u0027s pictures.)And in the meantime, over in the reception or conference room of the jail, Alvin Belknap and Reuben Jephson,side by side with Clyde, neatly arrayed in the very suit he had sought to sink forever in the waters of LowerTwelfth Lake. And with a new tie and shirt and shoes added in order to present him in his Lycurgus best.\n 　　Jephson, long and lean and shabbily dressed as usual, but with all of that iron and power that so impressed Clydein every line of his figure and every movement or gesture of his body. Belknap--looking like an Albany beau-theone on whom was to fall the burden of the opening presentation of the case as well as the cross-examining,now saying: \"Now you\u0027re not going to get frightened or show any evidence of nervousness at anything that maybe said or done at any time, are you, Clyde? We\u0027re to be with you, you know, all through the trial. You sit rightbetween us. And you\u0027re going to smile and look unconcerned or interested, just as you wish, but never fearful-butnot too bold or gay, you know, so that they\u0027d feel that you\u0027re not taking this thing seriously. You understand-justa pleasant, gentlemanly, and sympathetic manner all the time. And not frightened. For that will be certain todo us and you great harm. Since you\u0027re innocent, you have no real reason to be frightened--although you\u0027re sorry,of course. You understand all that, I know, by now.\"\"Yes, sir, I understand,\" replied Clyde. \"I will do just as you say. Besides, I never struck her intentionally, andthat\u0027s the truth. So why should I be afraid?\" And here he looked at Jephson, on whom, for psychic reasons, hedepended most. In fact the words he had just spoken were the very words which Jephson had so drilled into himduring the two months just past. And catching the look, Jephson now drew closer and fixing Clyde with hisgimlet and yet encouraging and sustaining blue eyes, began:\n 　　\"You\u0027re not guilty! You\u0027re not guilty, Clyde, see? You understand that fully by now, and you must alwaysbelieve and remember that, because it\u0027s true. You didn\u0027t intend to strike her, do you hear? You swear to that. Youhave sworn it to me and Belknap here, and we believe you. Now, it doesn\u0027t make the least bit of difference thatbecause of the circumstances surrounding all this we are not going to be able to make the average jury see this orbelieve it just as you tell it. That\u0027s neither here nor there. I\u0027ve told you that before. You know what the truth is-andso do we. BUT, in order to get justice for you, we\u0027ve had to get up something else--a dummy or substitute forthe real fact, which is that you didn\u0027t strike her intentionally, but which we cannot hope to make them see withoutdisguising it in some way. You get that, don\u0027t you?\"\"Yes, sir,\" replied Clyde, always over-awed and intrigued by this man.\n 　　\"And for that reason, as I\u0027ve so often told you, we\u0027ve invented this other story about a change of heart. It\u0027s notquite true as to time, but it is true that you did experience a change of heart there in the boat. And that\u0027s ourjustification. But they\u0027d never believe that under all of the peculiar circumstances, so we\u0027re merely going to movethat change of heart up a little, see? Make it before you ever went into that boat at all. And while we know it isn\u0027ttrue that way, still neither is the charge that you intentionally struck her true, and they\u0027re not going to electrocuteyou for something that isn\u0027t true--not with my consent, at least.\" He looked into Clyde\u0027s eyes for a moment more,and then added: \"It\u0027s this way, Clyde. It\u0027s like having to pay for potatoes, or for suits of clothes, with corn orbeans instead of money, when you have money to pay with but when, because of the crazy notions on the part ofsome one, they won\u0027t believe that the money you have is genuine. So you\u0027ve got to use the potatoes or beans.\n 　　And beans is what we\u0027re going to give \u0027em. But the justification is that you\u0027re not guilty. You\u0027re not guilty.\n 　　You\u0027ve sworn to me that you didn\u0027t intend to strike her there at the last, whatever you might have been provokedto do at first. And that\u0027s enough for me. You\u0027re not guilty.\"And here, firmly and convincingly, which was the illusion in regard to his own attitude which he was determinedto convey to Clyde, he laid hold of his coat lapels, and after looking fixedly into his somewhat strained and nownervous brown eyes, added: \"And now, whenever you get to feeling weak or nervous, or if, when you go on thestand, you think Mason is getting the best of you, I want you to remember this--just say to yourself--\u0027I\u0027m notguilty! I\u0027m not guilty! And they can\u0027t fairly convict me unless I really am.\u0027 And if that don\u0027t pull you together,look at me. I\u0027ll be right there. All you have to do, if you feel yourself rattled, is to look at me-- right into my eyes,just as I\u0027m looking at you now--and then you\u0027ll know that I\u0027m wanting you to brace up and do what I\u0027m tellingyou to do now--swear to the things that we are asking you to swear to, however they may look like lies, andhowever you may feel about them. I\u0027m not going to have you convicted for something you didn\u0027t do, just becauseyou can\u0027t be allowed to swear to what is the truth--not if I can help it. And now that\u0027s all.\"And here he slapped him genially and heartily on the back, while Clyde, strangely heartened, felt, for the timebeing at least, that certainly he could do as he was told, and would.\n 　　And then Jephson, taking out his watch and looking first at Belknap, then out of the nearest window throughwhich were to be seen the already assembled crowds--one about the courthouse steps; a second includingnewspapermen and women, newspaper photographers and artists, gathered closely before the jail walk, andeagerly waiting to \"snap\" Clyde or any one connected with this case--went calmly on with:\n 　　\"Well, it\u0027s about time, I guess. Looks as though all Cataraqui would like to get inside. We\u0027re going to have quitean audience.\" And turning to Clyde once more, he added: \"Now, you don\u0027t want to let those people disturb you,Clyde. They\u0027re nothing but a lot of country people come to town to see a show.\"And then the two of them, Belknap and Jephson, going out. And Kraut and Sissel coming in to take personalcharge of Clyde, while the two lawyers, passing amid whispers, crossed over to the court building in the squareof brown grass beyond.\n 　　And after them, and in less than five minutes, and preceded by Slack and Sissel and followed by Kraut andSwenk--yet protected on either side by two extra deputies in case there should be an outbreak or demonstrationof any kind--Clyde himself, attempting to look as jaunty and nonchalant as possible, yet because of the manyrough and strange faces about him--men in heavy raccoon coats and caps, and with thick whiskers, or in wornand faded and nondescript clothes such as characterized many of the farmers of this region, accompanied by theirwives and children, and all staring so strangely and curiously--he felt not a little nervous, as though at anymoment there might be a revolver shot, or some one might leap at him with a knife--the deputies with their handson their guns lending not a little to the reality of his mood. Yet only cries of: \"Here he comes! Here he comes!\"\"There he is!\" \"Would you believe that he could do a thing like that?\"And then the cameras clicking and whirring and his two protectors shouldering closer and closer to him while heshrank down within himself mentally.\n 　　And then a flight of five brown stone steps leading up to an old courthouse door. And beyond that, an inner flightof steps to a large, long, brown, high-ceilinged chamber, in which, to the right and left, and in the rear facingeast, were tall, thin, round-topped windows, fitted with thin panes, admitting a flood of light. And at the westend, a raised platform, with a highly ornamental, dark brown carved bench upon it. And behind it, a portrait--andon either side, north and south, and at the rear, benches and benches in rows--each tier higher than the other, andall crowded with people, the space behind them packed with standing bodies, and all apparently, as he entered,leaning and craning and examining him with sharp keen eyes, while there went about a conversational buzz orbrrh. He could hear a general sssss--pppp--as he approached and passed through a gate to an open space beyondit, wherein, as he could see, were Belknap and Jephson at a table, and between them a vacant chair for him. Andhe could see and feel the eyes and faces on which he was not quite willing to look.\n 　　But directly before him, at another table in the same square, but more directly below the raised platform at thewest end, as he could see now, were Mason and several men whom he seemed to recollect--Earl Newcomb andBurton Burleigh and yet another man whom he had never seen before, all four turning and gazing at him as hecame.\n 　　And about this inner group, an outer circle of men and women writers and sketch artists.\n 　　And then, after a time, recalling Belknap\u0027s advice, he managed to straighten up and with an air of studied easeand courage--which was belied to a certain extent by his strained, pale face and somewhat hazy stare--look at thewriters and artists who were either studying or sketching him, and even to whisper: \"Quite a full house, eh?\" Butjust then, and before he could say anything more, a resounding whack, whack, from somewhere. And then avoice: \"Order in the Court! His Honor, the Court! Everybody please rise!\" And as suddenly the whispering andstirring audience growing completely silent. And then, through a door to the south of the dais, a large urbane andflorid and smooth-faced man, who in an ample black gown, walked swiftly to the large chair immediately behindthe desk, and after looking steadily upon all before him, but without appearing to see any one of them seatedhimself. Whereupon every one assembled in the courtroom sat down.\n 　　And then to the left, yet below the judge, at a smaller desk, a smaller and older individual standing and calling,\"Oyez! Oyez! All persons having business before the honorable, the Supreme Court of the State of New York,County of Cataraqui, draw near and give attention. This court is now in session!\"And after that this same individual again rising and beginning: \"The State of New York against Clyde Griffiths.\"Then Mason, rising and standing before his table, at once announced: \"The People are ready.\" WhereuponBelknap arose, and in a courtly and affable manner, stated: \"The defendant is ready.\"Then the same clerk reached into a square box that was before him, and drawing forth a piece of paper, called\"Simeon Dinsmore,\" whereupon a little, hunched and brown-suited man, with claw-like hands, and a ferret-likeface, immediately scuttled to the jury box and was seated. And once there he was approached by Mason, who, ina brisk manner--his flat-nosed face looking most aggressive and his strong voice reaching to the uttermostcorners of the court, began to inquire as to his age, his business, whether he was single or married, how manychildren he had, whether he believed or did not believe in capital punishment. The latter question as Clyde atonce noted seemed to stir in him something akin to resentment or suppressed emotion of some kind, for at onceand with emphasis, he answered: \"I most certainly do--for some people\"--a reply which caused Mason to smileslightly and Jephson to turn and look toward Belknap, who mumbled sarcastically: \"And they talk about thepossibility of a fair trial here.\" But at the same time Mason feeling that this very honest, if all too convincedfarmer, was a little too emphatic in his beliefs, saying: \"With the consent of the Court, the People will excuse thetalesman.\" And Belknap, after an inquiring glance from the Judge, nodding his agreement, at which theprospective juror was excused.\n 　　And the clerk, immediately drawing out of the box a second slip of paper, and then calling: \"Dudley Sheerline!\"Whereupon, a thin, tall man of between thirty-eight and forty, neatly dressed and somewhat meticulous andcautious in his manner, approached and took his place in the box. And Mason once more began to question himas he had the other.\n 　　In the meantime, Clyde, in spite of both Belknap\u0027s and Jephson\u0027s preliminary precautions, was already feelingstiff and chill and bloodless. For, decidedly, as he could feel, this audience was inimical. And amid this closelypressing throng, as he now thought, with an additional chill, there must be the father and mother, perhaps also thesisters and brothers, of Roberta, and all looking at him, and hoping with all their hearts, as the newspapers duringthe weeks past informed him, that he would be made to suffer for this.\n 　　And again, all those people of Lycurgus and Twelfth Lake, no one of whom had troubled to communicate with him in any way, assuming him to be absolutely guilty, of course--were any of those here? Jill or Gertrude orTracy Trumbull, for instance? Or Wynette Phant or her brother? She had been at that camp at Bear Lake the dayhe was arrested. His mind ran over all the social personages whom he had encountered during the last year andwho would now see him as he was--poor and commonplace and deserted, and on trial for such a crime as this.\n 　　And after all his bluffing about his rich connections here and in the west. For now, of course, they would believehim as terrible as his original plot, without knowing or caring about his side of the story--his moods and fears-thatpredicament that he was in with Roberta--his love for Sondra and all that she had meant to him. Theywouldn\u0027t understand that, and he was not going to be allowed to tell anything in regard to it, even if he were sominded.\n 　　And yet, because of the advice of Belknap and Jephson, he must sit up and smile, or at least look pleasant andmeet the gaze of every one boldly and directly. And in consequence, turning, and for the moment feelingabsolutely transfixed. For there--God, what a resemblance!--to the left of him on one of those wall benches, wasa woman or girl who appeared to be the living image of Roberta! It was that sister of hers--Emily--of whom shehad often spoken--but oh, what a shock! His heart almost stopped. It might even be Roberta! And transfixing himwith what ghostly, and yet real, and savage and accusing eyes! And next to her another girl, looking somethinglike her, too--and next to her that old man, Roberta\u0027s father--that wrinkled old man whom he had encounteredthat day he had called at his farm door for information, now looking at him almost savagely, a gray and wearylook that said so plainly: \"You murderer! You murderer!\" And beside him a mild and small and ill-lookingwoman of about fifty, veiled and very shrunken and sunken-eyed, who, at his glance dropped her own eyes andturned away, as if stricken with a great pain, not hate. Her mother--no doubt of it. Oh, what a situation was this!\n 　　How unthinkably miserable! His heart fluttered. His hands trembled.\n 　　So now to stay himself, he looked down, first at the hands of Belknap and Jephson on the table before him, sinceeach was toying with a pencil poised above the pad of paper before them, as they gazed at Mason and whoeverwas in the jury box before him--a foolish-looking fat man now. What a difference between Jephson\u0027s andBelknap\u0027s hands--the latter so short and soft and white, the former\u0027s so long and brown and knotty and bony. AndBelknap\u0027s pleasant and agreeable manner here in court--his voice--\"I think I will ask the juror to step down\"--asopposed to Mason\u0027s revolver-like \"Excused!\" or Jephson\u0027s slow and yet powerful, though whispered, \"Better lethim go, Alvin. Nothing in him for us.\" And then all at once Jephson saying to him: \"Sit up! Sit up! Look around!\n 　　Don\u0027t sag down like that. Look people in the eye. Smile naturally, Clyde, if you\u0027re going to smile at all, just look\u0027em in the eye. They\u0027re not going to hurt you. They\u0027re just a lot of farmers out sightseeing.\"But Clyde, noting at once that several reporters and artists were studying and then sketching or writing of him,now flushed hotly and weakly, for he could feel their eager eyes and their eager words as clearly as he could heartheir scratching pens. And all for the papers--his blanching face and trembling hands--they would have thatdown--and his mother in Denver and everybody else there in Lycurgus would see and read--how he had lookedat the Aldens and they had looked at him and then he had looked away again. Still--still--he must get himselfbetter in hand--sit up once more and look about--or Jephson would be disgusted with him. And so once more hedid his best to crush down his fear, to raise his eyes and then turn slightly and look about.\n 　　But in doing so, there next to the wall, and to one side of that tall window, and just as he had feared, was TracyTrumbull, who evidently because of the law interest or his curiosity and what not--no pity or sympathy for him, surely--had come up for this day anyhow, and was looking, not at him for the moment, thank goodness, but atMason, who was asking the fat man some questions. And next to him Eddie Sells, with nearsighted eyesequipped with thick lenses of great distance-power, and looking in Clyde\u0027s direction, yet without seeing himapparently, for he gave no sign. Oh, how trying all this!\n 　　And five rows from them again, in another direction, Mr. and Mrs. Gilpin, whom Mason had found, of course.\n 　　And what would they testify to now? His calling on Roberta in her room there? And how secret it had all been?\n 　　That would be bad, of course. And of all people, Mr. and Mrs. George Newton! What were they going to putthem on the stand for? To tell about Roberta\u0027s life before she got to going with him, maybe? And that GraceMarr, whom he had seen often but met only once out there on Crum Lake, and whom Roberta had not liked anymore. What would she have to say? She could tell how he had met Roberta, of course, but what else? And then-but,no, it could not be--and yet--yet, it was, too--surely--that Orrin Short, of whom he had asked concerningGlenn. Gee!--he was going to tell about that now, maybe--no doubt of it. How people seemed to rememberthings--more than ever he would have dreamed they would have.\n 　　And again, this side of that third window from the front, but beyond that dreaded group of the Aldens, that verylarge and whiskered man who looked something like an old-time Quaker turned bandit--Heit was his name. Hehad met him at Three Mile Bay, and again on that day on which he had been taken up to Big Bittern against hiswill. Oh, yes, the coroner he was. And beside him, that innkeeper up there who had made him sign the registerthat day. And next to him the boathouse-keeper who had rented him the boat. And next to him, that tall, lankguide who had driven him and Roberta over from Gun Lodge, a brown and wiry and loutish man who seemed topierce him now with small, deep-set, animal-like eyes, and who most certainly was going to testify to all thedetails of that ride from Gun Lodge. Would his nervousness on that day, and his foolish qualms, be as clearlyremembered by him as they were now by himself. And if so, how would that affect his plea of a change of heart?\n 　　Would he not better talk all that over again with Jephson?\n 　　But this man Mason! How hard he was! How energetic! And how he must have worked to get all of these peoplehere to testify against him! And now here he was, exclaiming as he chanced to look at him, and as he had in atleast the last dozen cases (yet with no perceptible result in so far as the jury box was concerned), \"Acceptable tothe People!\" But, invariably, whenever he had done so, Jephson had merely turned slightly, but without looking,and had said: \"Nothing in him for us, Alvin. As set as a bone.\" And then Belknap, courteous and bland, hadchallenged for cause and usually succeeded in having his challenge sustained.\n 　　But then at last, and oh, how agreeably, the clerk of the court announcing in a clear, thin, rasping and aged voice,a recess until two P. M. And Jephson smilingly turning to Clyde with: \"Well, Clyde, that\u0027s the first round--not sovery much to it, do you think? And not very hard either, is it? Better go over there and get a good meal, though.\n 　　It\u0027ll be just as long and dull this afternoon.\"And in the meantime, Kraut and Sissel, together with the extra deputies, pushing close and surrounding him. Andthen the crowding and swarming and exclaiming: \"There he is! There he is! Here he comes! Here! Here!\" And alarge and meaty female pushing as close as possible and staring directly into his face, exclaiming as she did so:\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16837.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
