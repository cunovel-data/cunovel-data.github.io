{"id":1663,"no":55,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 36","content":"Nevertheless hours and even days, and finally a week and then ten days, passed without any word from him as tothe whereabouts of a doctor to whom she could go. For although having said so much to her he still did not knowto whom to apply. And each hour and day as great a menace to him as to her. And her looks as well as herinquiries registering how intense and vital and even clamorous at moments was her own distress. Also he washarried almost to the point of nervous collapse by his own inability to think of any speedy and sure way by whichshe might be aided. Where did a physician live to whom he might send her with some assurance of relief for her,and how was he to find out about him?\\n\\n 　　After a time, however, in running over all the names of those he knew, he finally struck upon a forlorn hope inthe guise of Orrin Short, the young man conducting the one small \"gents\u0027 furnishing store\" in Lycurgus whichcatered more or less exclusively to the rich youths of the city--a youth of about his own years and proclivities, asClyde had guessed, who ever since he had been here had been useful to him in the matter of tips as to dress andstyle in general. Indeed, as Clyde had for some time noted, Short was a brisk, inquiring and tactful person, who,in addition to being quite attractive personally to girls, was also always most courteous to his patrons,particularly to those whom he considered above him in the social scale, and among these was Clyde. For havingdiscovered that Clyde was related to the Griffiths, this same Short had sought, as a means for his own generaladvancement in other directions, to scrape as much of a genial and intimate relationship with him as possible,only, as Clyde saw it, and in view of the general attitude of his very high relatives, it had not, up to this time atleast, been possible for him to consider any such intimacy seriously. And yet, finding Short so very affable andhelpful in general, he was not above reaching at least an easy and genial surface relationship with him, whichShort appeared to accept in good part. Indeed, as at first, his manner remained seeking and not a littlesycophantic at times. And so it was that among all those with whom he could be said to be in either intimate or casual contact, Short was about the only one who offered even a chance for an inquiry which might proveproductive of some helpful information.\\n\\n 　　In consequence, in passing Short\u0027s place each evening and morning, once he thought of him in this light, he madeit a point to nod and smile in a most friendly manner, until at least three days had gone by. And then, feeling thathe had paved the way as much as his present predicament would permit, he stopped in, not at all sure that on thisfirst occasion he would be able to broach the dangerous subject. The tale he had fixed upon to tell Short was thathe had been approached by a young working-man in the factory, newly-married, who, threatened with an heirand not being able to afford one as yet, had appealed to him for information as to where he might now find adoctor to help him. The only interesting additions which Clyde proposed to make to this were that the youngman, being very poor and timid and not so very intelligent, was not able to speak or do much for himself. Alsothat he, Clyde, being better informed, although so new locally as not to be able to direct him to any physician (anafter-thought intended to put the idea into Short\u0027s mind that he himself was never helpless and so not likely everto want such advice himself), had already advised the young man of a temporary remedy. But unfortunately, sohis story was to run, this had already failed to work. Hence something more certain--a physician, no less--wasnecessary. And Short, having been here longer, and, as he had heard him explain, hailing previously fromGloversville, it was quite certain, as Clyde now argued with himself, that he would know of at least one--orshould. But in order to divert suspicion from himself he was going to add that of course he probably could getnews of some one in his own set, only, the situation being so unusual (any reference to any such thing in his ownworld being likely to set his own group talking), he preferred to ask some one like Short, who as a favor wouldkeep it quiet.\\n\\n 　　As it chanced on this occasion, Short himself, owing to his having done a very fair day\u0027s business, was in anexceedingly jovial frame of mind. And Clyde having entered, to buy a pair of socks, perhaps, he began: \"Well,it\u0027s good to see you again, Mr. Griffiths. How are you? I was just thinking it\u0027s about time you stopped in and letme show you some of the things I got in since you were here before. How are things with the Griffiths Companyanyhow?\"Short\u0027s manner, always brisk, was on this occasion doubly reassuring, since he liked Clyde, only now the latterwas so intensely keyed up by the daring of his own project that he could scarcely bring himself to carry the thingoff with the air he would have liked to have employed.\\n\\n 　　Nevertheless, being in the store and so, seemingly, committed to the project, he now began: \"Oh, pretty fair.\\n\\n 　　Can\u0027t kick a bit. I always have all I can do, you know.\" At the same time he began nervously fingering some tieshung upon movable nickeled rods. But before he had wasted a moment on these, Mr. Short, turning andspreading some boxes of very special ties from a shelf behind him on the glass case, remarked: \"Never mindlooking at those, Mr. Griffiths. Look at these. These are what I want to show you and they won\u0027t cost YOU anymore. Just got \u0027em in from New York this morning.\" He picked up several bundles of six each, the very latest, ashe explained. \"See anything else like this anywhere around here yet? I\u0027ll say you haven\u0027t.\" He eyed Clydesmilingly, the while he wished sincerely that such a young man, so well connected, yet not rich like the others,would be friends with him. It would place him here.\\n\\n 　　Clyde, fingering the offerings and guessing that what Short was saying was true, was now so troubled andconfused in his own mind that he could scarcely think and speak as planned. \"Very nice, sure,\" he said, turning them over, feeling that at another time he would have been pleased to possess at least two. \"I think maybe I\u0027lltake this one, anyhow, and this one, too.\" He drew out two and held them up, while he was thinking how tobroach the so much more important matter that had brought him here. For why should he be troubling to buy ties,dilly-dallying in this way, when all he wanted to ask Short about was this other matter? Yet how hard it wasnow--how very hard. And yet he really must, although perhaps not so abruptly. He would look around a littlemore at first in order to allay suspicion--ask about some socks. Only why should he be doing that, since he didnot need anything, Sondra only recently having presented him with a dozen handkerchiefs, some collars, ties andsocks. Nevertheless every time he decided to speak he felt a sort of sinking sensation at the pit of his stomach, afear that he could not or would not carry the thing off with the necessary ease and conviction. It was all soquestionable and treacherous--so likely to lead to exposure and disgrace in some way. He would probably not beable to bring himself to speak to Short to-night. And yet, as he argued with himself, how could the occasion everbe more satisfactory?\\n\\n 　　Short, in the meantime having gone to the rear of the store and now returning, with a most engaging and evensycophantic smile on his face, began with: \"Saw you last Tuesday evening about nine o\u0027clock going into theFinchleys\u0027 place, didn\u0027t I? Beautiful house and grounds they have there.\"Clyde saw that Short really was impressed by his social station here. There was a wealth of admiration mingledwith a touch of servility. And at once, because of this, he took heart, since he realized that with such an attitudedominating the other, whatever he might say would be colored in part at least by his admirer\u0027s awe and respect.\\n\\n 　　And after examining the socks and deciding that one pair at least would soften the difficulty of his demand, headded: \"Oh, by the way, before I forget it. There\u0027s something I\u0027ve been wanting to ask you about. Maybe you cantell me what I want to know. One of the boys at the factory--a young fellow who hasn\u0027t been married very long-aboutfour months now, I guess--is in a little trouble on account of his wife.\" He paused, because of hisuncertainty as to whether he could succeed with this now or not, seeing that Short\u0027s expression changed ever soslightly. And yet, having gone so far, he did not know how to recede. So now he laughed nervously and thenadded: \"I don\u0027t know why they always come to me with their troubles, but I guess they think I ought to know allabout these things.\" (He laughed again.) \"Only I\u0027m about as new and green here as anybody and so I\u0027m kindastumped. But you\u0027ve been here longer than I have, I guess, and so I thought I might ask you.\"His manner as he said this was as nonchalant as he could make it, the while he decided now that this was amistake--that Short would most certainly think him a fool or queer. Yet Short, taken back by the nature of thequery, which he sensed as odd coming from Clyde to him (he had noted Clyde\u0027s sudden restraint and slightnervousness), was still so pleased to think that even in connection with so ticklish a thing as this, he should bemade the recipient of his confidence, that he instantly recovered his former poise and affability, and replied:\\n\\n 　　\"Why, sure, if it\u0027s anything I can help you with, Mr. Griffiths, I\u0027ll be only too glad to. Go ahead, what is it?\"\"Well, it\u0027s this way,\" began Clyde, not a little revived by the other\u0027s hearty response, yet lowering his voice inorder to give the dreadful subject its proper medium of obscurity, as it were. \"His wife\u0027s already two monthsgone and he can\u0027t afford a kid yet and he doesn\u0027t know how to get rid of it. I told him last month when he firstcame to me to try a certain medicine that usually works\"--this to impress Short with his own personal wisdomand resourcefulness in such situations and hence by implication to clear his own skirts, as it were--\"But I guesshe didn\u0027t handle it right. Anyhow he\u0027s all worked up about it now and wants to see some doctor who could dosomething for her, you see. Only I don\u0027t know anybody here myself. Haven\u0027t been here long enough. If it were Kansas City or Chicago now,\" he interpolated securely, \"I\u0027d know what to do. I know three or four doctors outthere.\" (To impress Short he attempted a wise smile.) \"But down here it\u0027s different. And if I started asking aroundin my crowd and it ever got back to my relatives, they wouldn\u0027t understand. But I thought if you knew of any oneyou wouldn\u0027t mind telling me. I wouldn\u0027t really bother myself, only I\u0027m sorry for this fellow.\"He paused, his face, largely because of the helpful and interested expression on Short\u0027s, expressing moreconfidence than when he had begun. And although Short was still surprised he was more than pleased to be ashelpful as he could.\\n\\n 　　\"You say it\u0027s been two months now.\"\"Yes.\"\"And the stuff you suggested didn\u0027t work, eh?\"\"No.\"\"She\u0027s tried it again this month, has she?\"\"Yes.\"\"Well, that is bad, sure enough. I guess she\u0027s in bad all right. The trouble with this place is that I haven\u0027t beenhere so very long either, Mr. Griffiths. I only bought this place about a year and a half ago. Now, if I were overin Gloversville--\" He paused for a moment, as though, like Clyde, he too were dubious of the wisdom of enteringupon details of this kind, but after a few seconds continued: \"You see a thing like that\u0027s not so easy, whereveryou are. Doctors are always afraid of getting in trouble. I did hear once of a case over there, though, where a girlwent to a doctor--a fellow who lived a couple miles out. But she was of pretty good family too, and the fellowwho took her to him was pretty well-known about there. So I don\u0027t know whether this doctor would do anythingfor a stranger, although he might at that. But I know that sort of thing is going on all the time, so you might try. Ifyou wanta send this fellow to him, tell him not to mention me or let on who sent him, \u0027cause I\u0027m pretty well-known around there and I wouldn\u0027t want to be mixed up in it in case anything went wrong, you see. You knowhow it is.\"And Clyde, in turn, replied gratefully: \"Oh, sure, he\u0027ll understand all right. I\u0027ll tell him not to mention anynames.\" And getting the doctor\u0027s name, he extracted a pencil and notebook from his pocket in order to be surethat the important information should not escape him.\\n\\n 　　Short, sensing his relief, was inclined to wonder whether there was a working-man, or whether it was not Clydehimself who was in this scrape. Why should he be speaking for a young working-man at the factory? Just thesame, he was glad to be of service, though at the same time he was thinking what a bit of local news this wouldbe, assuming that any time in the future he should choose to retail it. Also that Clyde, unless he was truly playingabout with some girl here who was in trouble, was foolish to be helping anybody else in this way--particularly aworking-man. You bet he wouldn\u0027t.\\n\\n 　　Nevertheless he repeated the name, with the initials, and the exact neighborhood, as near as he could remember,giving the car stop and a description of the house. Clyde, having obtained what he desired, now thanked him, andthen went out while the haberdasher looked after him genially and a little suspiciously. These rich young bloods,he thought. That\u0027s a funny request for a fellow like that to make of me. You\u0027d think with all the people he knowsand runs with here he\u0027d know some one who would tip him off quicker than I could. Still, maybe, it\u0027s just becauseof them that he is afraid to ask around here. You don\u0027t know who he might have got in trouble--that youngFinchley girl herself, even. You never can tell. I see him around with her occasionally, and she\u0027s gay enough.\\n\\n 　　But, gee, wouldn\u0027t that be the . . .\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16692.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
