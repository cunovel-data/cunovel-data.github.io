{"id":1643,"no":35,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 16","content":"The outcome of that afternoon was so wonderful for both that for days thereafter neither could cease thinkingabout it or marveling that anything so romantic and charming should have brought them together so intimatelywhen both were considering that it was not wise for either to know the other any better than employee andsuperior.\n 　　After a few moments of badinage in the boat in which he had talked about the beauty of the lilies and how gladhe was to get them for her, they picked up her friend, Grace, and eventually returned to the boathouse.\n 　　Once on the land again there developed not a little hesitation on her part as well as his as to how farther toproceed, for they were confronted by the problem of returning into Lycurgus together. As Roberta saw it, itwould not look right and might create talk. And on his part, he was thinking of Gilbert and other people he knew.\n 　　The trouble that might come of it. What Gilbert would say if he did hear. And so both he and she, as well asGrace, were dubious on the instant about the wisdom of riding back together. Grace\u0027s own reputation, as well asthe fact that she knew Clyde was not interested in her, piqued her. And Roberta, realizing this from her manner,said: \"What do you think we had better do, excuse ourselves?\"At once Roberta tried to think just how they could extricate themselves gracefully without offending Clyde.\n 　　Personally she was so enchanted that had she been alone she would have preferred to have ridden back with him.\n 　　But with Grace here and in this cautious mood, never. She must think up some excuse.\n 　　And at the same time, Clyde was wondering just how he was to do now--ride in with them and brazenly face thepossibility of being seen by some one who might carry the news to Gilbert Griffiths or evade doing so on somepretext or other. He could think of none, however, and was about to turn and accompany them to the car whenthe young electrician, Shurlock, who lived in the Newton household and who had been on the balcony of thepavilion, hailed them. He was with a friend who had a small car, and they were ready to return to the city.\n 　　\"Well, here\u0027s luck,\" he exclaimed. \"How are you, Miss Alden? How do you do, Miss Marr? You two don\u0027thappen to be going our way, do you? If you are, we can take you in with us.\"Not only Roberta but Clyde heard. And at once she was about to say that, since it was a little late and she andGrace were scheduled to attend church services with the Newtons, it would be more convenient for them toreturn this way. She was, however, half hoping that Shurlock would invite Clyde and that he would accept. Buton his doing so, Clyde instantly refused. He explained that he had decided to stay out a little while longer. Andso Roberta left him with a look that conveyed clearly enough the gratitude and delight she felt. They had hadsuch a good time. And he in turn, in spite of many qualms as to the wisdom of all this, fell to brooding on howsad it was that just he and Roberta might not have remained here for hours longer. And immediately after theyhad gone, he returned to the city alone.\n 　　The next morning he was keener than ever to see Roberta again. And although the peculiarly exposed nature ofthe work at the factory made it impossible for him to demonstrate his feelings, still by the swift and admiring andseeking smiles that played over his face and blazed in his eyes, she knew that he was as enthusiastic, if not moreso, as on the night before. And on her part, although she felt that a crisis of some sort was impending, and inspite of the necessity of a form of secrecy which she resented, she could not refrain from giving him a warm andquite yielding glance in return. The wonder of his being interested in her! The wonder and the thrill!\n 　　Clyde decided at once that his attentions were still welcome. Also that he might risk saying something to her,supposing that a suitable opportunity offered. And so, after waiting an hour and seeing two fellow workers leavefrom either side of her, he seized the occasion to drift near and to pick up one of the collars she had just stamped,saying, as though talking about that: \"I was awfully sorry to have to leave you last night. I wish we were outthere again to-day instead of here, just you and me, don\u0027t you?\"Roberta turned, conscious that now was the time to decide whether she would encourage or discourage anyattention on his part. At the same time she was almost faintingly eager to accept his attentions regardless of theproblem in connection with them. His eyes! His hair! His hands! And then instead of rebuking or chilling him inany way, she only looked, but with eyes too weak and melting to mean anything less than yielding anduncertainty. Clyde saw that she was hopelessly and helplessly drawn to him, as indeed he was to her. On theinstant he was resolved to say something more, when he could, as to where they could meet when no one wasalong, for it was plain that she was no more anxious to be observed than he was. He well knew more sharply todaythan ever before that he was treading on dangerous ground.\n 　　He began to make mistakes in his calculations, to feel that, with her so near him, he was by no meansconcentrating on the various tasks before him. She was too enticing, too compelling in so many ways to him.\n 　　There was something so warm and gay and welcome about her that he felt that if he could persuade her to love him he would be among the most fortunate of men. Yet there was that rule, and although on the lake the daybefore he had been deciding that his position here was by no means as satisfactory as it should be, still withRoberta in it, as now it seemed she well might be, would it not be much more delightful for him to stay? Couldhe not, for the time being at least, endure the further indifference of the Griffiths? And who knows, might theynot yet become interested in him as a suitable social figure if only he did nothing to offend them? And yet herehe was attempting to do exactly the thing he had been forbidden to do. What kind of an injunction was this,anyhow, wherewith Gilbert had enjoined him? If he could come to some understanding with her, perhaps shewould meet him in some clandestine way and thus obviate all possibility of criticism.\n 　　It was thus that Clyde, seated at his desk or walking about, was thinking. For now his mind, even in the face ofhis duties, was almost entirely engaged by her, and he could think of nothing else. He had decided to suggest thatthey meet for the first time, if she would, in a small park which was just west of the first outlying resort on theMohawk. But throughout the day, so close to each other did the girls work, he had no opportunity tocommunicate with her. Indeed noontime came and he went below to his lunch, returning a little early in the hopeof finding her sufficiently detached to permit him to whisper that he wished to see her somewhere. But she wassurrounded by others at the time and so the entire afternoon went by without a single opportunity.\n 　　However, as he was going out, he bethought him that if he should chance to meet her alone somewhere in thestreet, he would venture to speak to her. For she wanted him to--that he knew, regardless of what she might sayat any time. And he must find some way that would appear as accidental and hence as innocent to her as toothers. But as the whistle blew and she left the building she was joined by another girl, and he was left to think ofsome other way.\n 　　That same evening, however, instead of lingering about the Peyton house or going to a moving picture theater, ashe so often did now, or walking alone somewhere in order to allay his unrest and loneliness, he chose nowinstead to seek out the home of Roberta on Taylor Street. It was not a pleasing house, as he now decided, notnearly so attractive as Mrs. Cuppy\u0027s or the house in which he now dwelt. It was too old and brown, theneighborhood too nondescript, if conservative. But the lights in different rooms glowing at this early hour gave ita friendly and genial look. And the few trees in front were pleasant. What was Roberta doing now? Why couldn\u0027tshe have waited for him in the factory? Why couldn\u0027t she sense now that he was outside and come out? Hewished intensely that in some way he could make her feel that he was out here, and so cause her to come out. Butshe didn\u0027t. On the contrary, he observed Mr. Shurlock issue forth and disappear toward Central Avenue. And,after that, pedestrian after pedestrian making their way out of different houses along the street and towardCentral, which caused him to walk briskly about the block in order to avoid being seen. At the same time hesighed often, because it was such a fine night--a full moon rising about nine-thirty and hanging heavy andyellow over the chimney tops. He was so lonely.\n 　　But at ten, the moon becoming too bright, and no Roberta appearing, he decided to leave. It was not wise to behanging about here. But the night being so fine he resented the thought of his room and instead walked up anddown Wykeagy Avenue, looking at the fine houses there--his uncle Samuel\u0027s among them. Now, all theiroccupants were away at their summer places. The houses were dark. And Sondra Finchley and Bertine Cranstonand all that company--what were they doing on a night like this? Where dancing? Where speeding? Whereloving? It was so hard to be poor, not to have money and position and to be able to do in life exactly as youwished.\n 　　And the next morning, more eager than usual, he was out of Mrs. Peyton\u0027s by six-forty-five, anxious to find someway of renewing his attentions to Roberta. For there was that crowd of factory workers that proceeded northalong Central Avenue. And she would be a unit in it, of course, at about 7.10. But his trip to the factory wasfruitless. For, after swallowing a cup of coffee at one of the small restaurants near the post-office and walking thelength of Central Avenue toward the mill, and pausing at a cigar store to see if Roberta should by any chancecome along alone, he was rewarded by the sight of her with Grace Marr again. What a wretched, crazy world thiswas, he at once decided, and how difficult it was in this miserable town for anyone to meet anyone else alone.\n 　　Everyone, nearly, knew everyone else. Besides, Roberta knew that he was trying to get a chance to talk to her.\n 　　Why shouldn\u0027t she walk alone then? He had looked at her enough yesterday. And yet here she was walking withGrace Marr and appeared seemingly contented. What was the matter with her anyhow?\n 　　By the time he reached the factory he was very sour. But the sight of Roberta taking her place at her bench andtossing him a genial \"good morning\" with a cheerful smile, caused him to feel better and that all was not lost.\n 　　It was three o\u0027clock in the afternoon and a lull due to the afternoon heat, the fag of steadily continued work, andthe flare of reflected light from the river outside was over all. The tap, tap, tap of metal stamps upon scores ofcollars at once--nearly always slightly audible above the hum and whirr of the sewing machines beyond was, ifanything, weaker than usual. And there was Ruza Nikoforitch, Hoda Petkanas, Martha Bordaloue, Angelina Pittiand Lena Schlict, all joining in a song called \"Sweethearts\" which some one had started. And Roberta,perpetually conscious of Clyde\u0027s eyes, as well as his mood, was thinking how long it would be before he wouldcome around with some word in regard to something. For she wished him to--and because of his whisperedwords of the day before, she was sure that it would not be long, because he would not be able to resist it. Hiseyes the night before had told her that. Yet because of the impediments of this situation she knew that he must behaving a difficult time thinking of any way by which he could say anything to her. And still at certain momentsshe was glad, for there were such moments when she felt she needed the security which the presence of so manygirls gave her.\n 　　And as she thought of all this, stamping at her desk along with the others, she suddenly discovered that a bundleof collars which she had already stamped as sixteens were not of that size but smaller. She looked at it quicklyand nervously, then decided that there was but one thing to do--lay the bundle aside and await comment fromone of the foremen, including Clyde, or take it directly to him now--really the better way, because it preventedany of the foremen seeing it before he did. That was what all the girls did when they made mistakes of any kind.\n 　　And all trained girls were supposed to catch all possible errors of that kind.\n 　　And yet now and in the face of all her very urgent desires she hesitated, for this would take her direct to Clydeand give him the opportunity he was seeking. But, more terrifying, it was giving her the opportunity she wasseeking. She wavered between loyalty to Clyde as a superintendent, loyalty to her old conventions as opposed toher new and dominating desire and her repressed wish to have Clyde speak to her--then went over with thebundle and laid it on his desk. But her hands, as she did so, trembled. Her face was white--her throat taut. At themoment, as it chanced, he was almost vainly trying to calculate the scores of the different girls from the stubslaid before him, and was having a hard time of it because his mind was not on what he was doing. And then helooked up. And there was Roberta bending toward him. His nerves became very taut, his throat and lips, dry, forhere and now was his opportunity. And, as he could see, Roberta was almost suffocating from the strain which her daring and self-deception was putting upon her nerves and heart.\n 　　\"There\u0027s been a distake\" (she meant to say mistake) \"in regard to this bundle upstairs,\" she began. \"I didn\u0027t noticeit either until I\u0027d stamped nearly all of them. They\u0027re fifteen-and-a-half and I\u0027ve stamped nearly all of themsixteen. I\u0027m sorry.\"Clyde noticed, as she said this, that she was trying to smile a little and appear calm, but her cheeks were quiteblanched and her hands, particularly the one that held the bundle, trembled. On the instant he realized thatalthough loyalty and order were bringing her with this mistake to him, still there was more than that to it. In aweak, frightened, and yet love-driven way, she was courting him, giving him the opportunity he was seeking,wishing him to take advantage of it. And he, embarrassed and shaken for the moment by this sudden visitation,was still heartened and hardened into a kind of effrontery and gallantry such as he had not felt as yet in regard toher. She was seeking him--that was plain. She was interested, and clever enough to make the occasion whichpermitted him to speak. Wonderful! The sweetness of her daring.\n 　　\"Oh, that\u0027s all right,\" he said, pretending a courage and a daring in regard to her which he did not feel even now.\n 　　\"I\u0027ll just send them down to the wash room and then we\u0027ll see if we can\u0027t restamp them. It\u0027s not our mistake,really.\"He smiled most warmly and she met his look with a repressed smile of her own, already turning and fearing thatshe had manifested too clearly what had brought her.\n 　　\"But don\u0027t go,\" he added quickly. \"I want to ask you something. I\u0027ve been trying to get a word with you eversince Sunday. I want you to meet me somewhere, will you? There\u0027s a rule here that says a head of a departmentcan\u0027t have anything to do with a girl who works for him--outside I mean. But I want you to see me just the same,won\u0027t you? You know,\" and he smiled winsomely and coaxingly into her eyes, \"I\u0027ve been just nearly crazy overyou ever since you came in here and Sunday made it worse. And now I\u0027m not going to let any old rule comebetween me and you, if I can help it. Will you?\"\"Oh, I don\u0027t know whether I can do that or not,\" replied Roberta, who, now that she had succeeded inaccomplishing what she had wished, was becoming terrorized by her own daring. She began looking aroundnervously and feeling that every eye in the room must be upon her. \"I live with Mr. and Mrs. Newton, myfriend\u0027s sister and brother-in-law, you know, and they\u0027re very strict. It isn\u0027t the same as if--\" She was going to add\"I was home,\" but Clyde interrupted her.\n 　　\"Oh, now please don\u0027t say no, will you? Please don\u0027t. I want to see you. I don\u0027t want to cause you any trouble,that\u0027s all. Otherwise I\u0027d be glad to come round to your house. You know how it is.\"\"Oh, no, you mustn\u0027t do that,\" cautioned Roberta. \"Not yet anyhow.\" She was so confused that quiteunconsciously she was giving Clyde to understand that she was expecting him to come around some time later.\n 　　\"Well,\" smiled Clyde, who could see that she was yielding in part. \"We could just walk out near the end of somestreet here--that street you live in, if you wish. There are no houses out there. Or there\u0027s a little park--Mohawk-justwest of Dreamland on the Mohawk Street line. It\u0027s right on the river. You might come out there. I could meet you where the car stops. Will you do that?\"\"Oh, I\u0027d be afraid to do that I think--go so far, I mean. I never did anything like that before.\" She looked soinnocent and frank as she said this that Clyde was quite carried away by the sweetness of her. And to think hewas making a clandestine appointment with her. \"I\u0027m almost afraid to go anywhere here alone, you know. Peopletalk so here, they say, and some one would be sure to see me. But--\"\"Yes, but what?\"\"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m staying too long at your desk here, don\u0027t you think?\" She actually gasped as she said it. And Clyderealizing the openness of it, although there was really nothing very unusual about it, now spoke quickly andforcefully.\n 　　\"Well, then, how about the end of that street you live in? Couldn\u0027t you come down there for just a little while tonight--a half hour or so, maybe?\"\"Oh, I couldn\u0027t make it to-night, I think--not so soon. I\u0027ll have to see first, you know. Arrange, that is. But anotherday.\" She was so excited and troubled by this great adventure of hers that her face, like Clyde\u0027s at times, changedfrom a half smile to a half frown without her realizing that it was registering these changes.\n 　　\"Well, then, how about Wednesday night at eight-thirty or nine? Couldn\u0027t you do that? Please, now.\"Roberta considered most sweetly, nervously. Clyde was enormously fascinated by her manner at the moment, forshe looked around, conscious, or so she seemed, that she was being observed and that her stay here for a firstvisit was very long.\n 　　\"I suppose I\u0027d better be going back to my work now,\" she replied without really answering him.\n 　　\"Wait a minute,\" pled Clyde. \"We haven\u0027t fixed on the time for Wednesday. Aren\u0027t you going to meet me? Makeit nine or eight-thirty, or any time you want to. I\u0027ll be there waiting for you after eight if you wish. Will you?\"\"All right, then, say eight-thirty or between eight-thirty and nine, if I can. Is that all right? I\u0027ll come if I can, youknow, and if anything does happen I\u0027ll tell you the next morning, you see.\" She flushed and then looked aroundonce more, a foolish, flustered look, then hurried back to her bench, fairly tingling from head to toe, and lookingas guilty as though she had been caught red-handed in some dreadful crime. And Clyde at his desk was almostchoking with excitement. The wonder of her agreeing, of his talking to her like that, of her venturing to make adate with him at all here in Lycurgus, where he was so well-known! Thrilling!\n 　　For her part, she was thinking how wonderful it would be just to walk and talk with him in the moonlight, to feelthe pressure of his arm and hear his soft appealing voice.\n 那天下午湖畔邂逅给他们俩都留下美妙的印象，随后一连好几天，谁也情不自禁，频频怀念，不觉对他们这么美妙的机缘感到万分惊讶，可是他们却又心照不宣，因为雇工与上司之间是不应该那么过分亲近的。 \n \n 他们在小船上说笑了一会儿。克莱德谈到这些睡莲有多美，能给她采撷睡莲感到很高兴。他们让格雷斯也上了小船，最后又回到了租船的地方。 \n \n 他们俩一上岸，都有点儿犯疑，真不知道下一步该怎么办。因为明摆在他们面前的问题，就是: \n \n 是不是一块儿回莱柯格斯去。罗伯达认为这样似乎不妥当，可能引起风言风语。而克莱德呢，也想到吉尔伯特和他自己所认识的一些人，以及由此可能招来的麻烦。吉尔伯特要是听到这件事，又会怎么说呢。因此，克莱德。罗伯达和格雷斯一时都有些迟疑不定，真不知道一起乘车回去是否明智。格雷斯要为自己的名誉操心，而且还知道克莱德对她不感兴趣，因而很呕气。罗伯达一眼看出了女友的心思，就说: \n \n \"依你看，我们该怎么办? \n \n 同他告辞，好吗? \n \n \"罗伯达立刻暗自思忖，她们怎样才能落落大方脱身，但又不让克莱德扫兴。 \n \n 就她自己来说，她对他已是那么入迷，要是格雷斯不在身边，本来她乐意同他一起搭车回去。不过，眼前有格雷斯在场，加上她自己又是那么谨小慎微，这就断断乎不好办了。她非得想出一个脱身之计不可。 \n \n 这时，克莱德也在暗自寻思，该怎么办才好……同她们一起搭车回去，冒着风险，万一被人撞见了，报告吉尔伯特。格里菲思一家人呢，还是另找一个什么借口同她们分手告别。无奈他什么借口托词都找不到，正想转身陪她们上电车站，就在这时，寄宿在牛顿夫妇家里，恰好在一个阳台上的年轻的电工舒洛克突然在向他们大声招呼了。舒洛克正好跟一个朋友(此人有一辆小汽车)打算一起回城去。 \n \n \"哦，真是太巧了，\"他大声喊道。\"你好，奥尔登小姐? \n \n 你好，玛尔小姐? \n \n 你们二位是不是跟我们同道? \n \n 要是同道，我们可以把你们一块捎去。\"这句话，不仅罗伯达，甚至连克莱德也都听见了。她马上回答说，时间不早了，她跟格雷斯还要陪牛顿夫妇去教堂，因此，坐小汽车回去的确方便些。 \n \n 不过，她似乎还希望舒洛克会邀克莱德一起上车，希望克莱德会接受他的邀请。 \n \n 后来尽管舒洛克邀请了他，克莱德却马上谢绝了，说他要在这儿多待一会儿。 \n \n 因此，罗伯达临走时看了他一眼，借以充分表达了她心中喜悦和感激之情。刚才他们在一起度过了多么愉快的时光。至于他呢，尽管对这一切是否正当尚有疑虑，却在暗自思忖: \n \n 他跟罗伯达不能在这儿多待几个钟头真够伤心的。他们走了以后，他也马上独自一人回城了。 \n \n 转天早晨，他比往常更加急急乎想见到罗伯达。虽说厂里工作都是在众目睽睽之下进行的，使他不可能表达出自己的感情来，可是，从他脸上和眼里一闪而过的爱慕和试探性的微笑里，罗伯达知道他的心情如果说不是更加强烈的话，至少还是如昨天一样兴奋。那她自己呢，虽然觉得好象某种灾难就要临头，而且这一切还必须保守秘密，当然使她很不高兴，可她还是情不自禁向他回送热情。温顺的秋波。瞧他已被她吸引住了! \n \n 真是多么叫人惊心动魄! \n \n 克莱德马上断定: \n \n 他献的殷勤还是受欢迎的，往后如有什么合适机会，他准备冒险跟罗伯达说说话。因此，他等了个把钟头，正好她两旁的女工一走开，这时，他便抓住机会来到了她身边，从她刚才打过印的领子中拿起一条，仿佛是专门在谈领子似的对她说: \n \n \"昨儿晚上不得不跟你分手，真是非常抱歉。我巴不得今儿个我们俩再上那儿去，而不是待在这里。而且只有你和我两个人。你说怎么样? \n \n \"罗伯达侧过身来，心里明白，此刻就得决定: \n \n 对于他的盛情邀请，她是鼓励呢，还是一口回绝。同时，她心中又几乎有点儿昏昏迷迷，急急乎要接受他献的殷勤，对于他们俩会发生什么问题，她也全都不管了。瞧他的眼睛! \n \n 他的头发! \n \n 他的手! \n \n 她不但没有责备他或是冷淡他，反而一个劲儿凝望着他，眼里是那么软弱无力。令人动怜，却又露出温顺和茫然若失的神情。克莱德见她已情不自禁，倾心于他，的确如同他也钟情于她那样，他马上决定，一有机会就跟她再说几句话，问问她也许在什么地方两人见面，不要有旁人在场。因为很显然，她如同他一样，也不乐意让别人看见。今天，他比往日里更深切地意识到: \n \n 他走的正是一条危险的道路。 \n \n 现在他算帐时开始出差错了。他感到，只要罗伯达在他身边，他干什么工作也都专心不起来。他觉得，她简直是太迷人，太令人倾倒了。她是那样热情。 \n \n 快活。可爱。他觉得，他要是能赢得她的爱，那就可以成为天底下最幸福的人了。不过，毕竟还有吉尔伯特说过的那个厂规呢。虽说昨天在湖上他就下过这样结论……他在厂里处境并不是那么称心如意，可是，只要有希望罗伯达能在他身旁，那末，他继续在厂里待下去，岂不是有更大乐趣吗? \n \n 难道说格里菲思一家人的冷淡，他就不能……至少在目前……再忍受一下吗? \n \n 只要他不去干冒犯他们的事情，说不定将来他们对他感到兴趣，并将他纳入他们上流社会那个圈子里去吧? \n \n 不过，现在他一心想做的事，正好是断断乎做不得的。而吉尔伯特告诫他的那一套训谕，又算得上什么呢? \n \n 只要他能够说服她，也许她会暗底里跟他幽会，这样也就完全可以不被人家议论了。 \n \n 这时，克莱德不论坐在桌旁办公，还是在车间里走路，心心念念想的都是这些。甚至在厂里上班时，他差不多时时刻刻都惦念着她，再也不去考虑其他的事情。他决定向她提议说，如果她乐意，他们就在莱柯格斯城西。莫霍克河上第一个郊外游人常去的小公园里会面。不过，这一天女工们都挨挤在一起干活，他没有机会跟她说话。午休时，他下楼用过午餐，比往日早一点回来，希望这时她已独自一人，好让他低声耳语告诉她，他心里巴不得在什么地方跟她见见面。可她四周还是围着一拨人，整整一个下午就这样过去了，始终没有说话机会。 \n \n 到最后离厂时，他心里还在琢磨，要是碰巧遇到她独自一人在街上，他就会走过去跟她说说话。她也巴不得他这样做……这一点，他心里很清楚，哪怕她嘴上说的不是那样。他就得想方设法，务必使他们的见面在她或者别人看来，好象完全是巧遇，因而也是无伤大雅的。不过，汽笛一响，她走出厂门时，正跟一个姑娘一块走着。这样，克莱德就得另想办法了。 \n \n 往常一到傍晚，他不是憋闷在佩顿太太家里，就是上电影院(这是近来他常去之处)，或则独个儿出去散散步，聊解愁怀。但那一天傍晚，他却一反常态，决定去泰勒街寻访罗伯达的寓所。他认定那不是一所令人喜爱的房子，远不如柯比太太的房子或是现在他住的房子那样吸引人。房子太破旧，而且黑不溜丢，街坊邻居抱残守缺，简直难以形容。不过，天色还早，各个房间里已掌了灯，就给人一种亲切感。门前两三棵树，克莱德也还喜欢。那末，此刻罗伯达正在干什么呢? \n \n 为什么她不在工厂附近等一等他呢? \n \n 为什么她没有想到他已来到这儿，不出来接接他呢? \n \n 是的，他真恨不得有办法能让她感觉到他已来到这儿，因此就出来接他。可她并没有感觉到。恰好相反，他只看见舒洛克走了出来，冲中央大道走去，一下子就没影儿了。随后，家家户户都有人出来，沿着大街往中央大道走去。于是，他急忙离开罗伯达寓所远远的，免得惹人注目。这时，他免不了长叹短吁，因为正当一个美好的夜晚……大约九点半，一轮满月在冉冉上升，黄澄澄地高悬在家家户户烟囱之上。他有多么孤单啊。 \n \n 不过，到了十点钟，月光变得越发明亮，还不见罗伯达出来，他就决定走了。在这儿滞留太久，很不妥当。不过，夜色那么美，他才不想回到自己房间去呢。于是，他就在威克吉大街上徘徊倘佯，举目张望那里漂亮的房子……包括他伯父塞缪尔的府邸在内。这时，所有这些府邸的主人，都到他们的避暑别墅去了。窗子里一点儿灯光都没有。桑德拉。芬奇利。伯蒂娜。克兰斯顿，以及所有那一伙人……在这样的一个夜晚，他们都在干些什么呢? \n \n 他们在哪里跳舞呢? \n \n 在哪里超速开车兜风呢? \n \n 还是在哪里谈情说爱呢? \n \n 穷人嘛，没有钱，没有地位，就没法随心所欲地生活，该有多么难受。 \n \n 翌日早上，他比往日更加急不可耐，六点四十五分就走出佩顿太太家的大门，心里急于想出一个办法来，再向罗伯达大献殷勤。这时正有一大群工人沿着中央大道往北走去。大约在七点十分左右，当然罗，她也一定是在这股人流之中。不过，他这回去工厂路上，还是没碰到罗伯达。因为，他在邮局附近一家小餐厅急匆匆喝了一杯咖啡，走完整整一条通往工厂的中央大道，到了一家烟铺门口歇歇脚，看看罗伯达会不会碰巧独自一人在走路，结果呢，只见到她又是跟格雷斯。玛尔走在一起。他心里马上就想到: \n \n 当今这个世界该有多么可怜，多么丧心病狂;就在这么一个可怜巴巴的小城里，要跟一个人单独见面，该有多难啊。不拘是谁，差不多人人都认识。再说，罗伯达也知道他正在设法找机会跟她说话。那她为什么不独自一人走呢? \n \n 昨天，他老是朝着她举目四望。可现在呢，她却跟格雷斯。玛尔走在一起，而且还显得好象心满意足似的。她到底是怎么个意思? \n \n 他进厂时心里可真是灰溜溜的。不过，一看到罗伯达正坐在自己座位上，对他笑吟吟，亲昵地说了一声\"您好\"，这才使他心里宽慰不少，觉得还有些希望。 \n \n 到了下午三点钟，由于午后天气转热和不停地干活疲乏，大家都有些昏昏欲睡的样子;窗外骄阳似火，满屋子都是骄阳照在河面上的反光，令人眩目。几十条领子打印时一齐发出的嗒嗒声……平时在外间缝纫机的咔嚓声以外依稀还能听得见，可此时此刻，这种嗒嗒声却比往常更加微弱了。这时，有人领头唱了一支叫做《情人》的歌，罗莎。尼柯弗列奇。霍达。佩特卡娜斯，玛莎。博达洛。安吉利娜。皮蒂。莉娜。希利克特一下子都跟着唱了起来。罗伯达却一个劲儿注意克莱德的眼神和心态，暗自思忖还要多久他才会走过来，跟她说些什么呢。她心里真巴不得他能这样……从他昨天的低声耳语里，她相信，要不了多久，他就会来的，因为他早已身不由己了。她从昨天晚上他的眼神里已经看出来了。不过因为这里诸多不便，她知道，他要设法跟她说话，一定也是煞费苦心。可是，有时她又觉得高兴，因为她感到自己置身于这么多姑娘中间就有一种安全感。 \n \n 她一面在想心事，一面跟别人一起给领子打印。蓦然间，她发现有一捆领子，她虽然打了\"１６\"，其实不是那个尺码，还得小一些。她焦急不安地瞅着这一捆领子，心里想只有一个办法……先把这一捆撂在一边，听候不知道是哪一个领班(包括克莱德在内)来批评她，要不然，干脆现在就把这捆领子直接送到他那儿去……说实话，也许这个办法好一些，因为这样可以不让别的领班比他先看到。大凡姑娘们出了什么差错，也都是这样照办不误的。类似这样的差错，就是训练有素的女工们，也在所难免。 \n \n 不过，尽管眼下她对他正怀着强烈的欲念，此刻却又迟疑不定了。因为她这一去直接找克莱德，无异于给了他一个正在寻摸的机会。但更可怕的是，这也给了她自己正在寻摸的机会。她心里摇摆不定: \n \n 一方面应该向作为监工的克莱德负责，另一方面还得恪守她那老一套传统观念，尽管这些传统观念跟她此刻新的压倒一切的愿望，以及她竭力压制下去的。要让克莱德跟她说话的希望是大相径庭的……到头来她还是拿起这捆领子走了过去，放到他桌子上。不过，她把领子放在桌子上时，两手却在瑟瑟发抖。她脸色煞白……嗓子眼发紧。这时，克莱德正好根据桌子上的存根，仔细统计女工们打印过的件数，但因为他心不在焉，感到很别扭。过了一会儿，他抬眼一看: \n \n 原来是罗伯达正俯身伫立在他跟前。他的神经一下子紧张极了，连嗓子眼和嘴唇也都发干: \n \n 因为，他梦寐以求的机会终于来到了。同时，他还看到罗伯达心神也紧张极了，几乎都透不过气来: \n \n 显然她明白自己这种举动太大胆，而且是在欺骗自己。 \n \n \"楼上送下来的这一捆，早就弄\u0027 \n \n \u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027岔，了，\"(本来她是要说弄\"错\"了)她一开口，就语无伦次地说。\"差不多都打完了，我才发现。应该是１５。５，我差不多都给打上１６了。请您原谅。\"克莱德发觉她说话时有点儿强作笑颜，故作镇静的样子，可她两颊几乎煞白，她的手，特别是拿着那捆领子的手，却在瑟瑟发抖。他马上明白: \n \n 尽管她上他这儿来，说明她工作认真。恪守厂规，可其中还包含着更多东西。瞧她软弱。 \n \n 骇怕，但又被爱情所驱使，她这是来向他求爱的，给了他一个求之不得的机会，巴望他能好好利用它。这在眼前突然出现的景象，一时间让他感到既窘迫，又震惊。可他还是振作起来，索性厚着脸皮，大献殷勤，这在过去，他对她从来都不是这样的。她迷上了他……这是明摆着的。她对他真有情意，她聪明得很，让他有机会跟他说说话。真了不起! \n \n 瞧她这种大胆，该有多可爱。 \n \n \"哦，这算不了什么，\"他说话时对她装出勇敢而又大胆的样子，其实，即使在此刻，他在她面前也并不见得真的这样大胆。\"我送楼下洗布间去漂洗一下，再看能不能重新打上，这就得了。说实话，这并不是我们的差错。\"他非常热情地向她微微一笑，她也很勉强向他报以一笑，身子早就转了过来，深怕她的来意太外露了。 \n \n \"不过，你先别走，\"他马上找补着说。\"我想问你一件事。打从星期天起，我一直想找机会跟你说话。我希望你我在什么地方见见面，好吗? \n \n 固然，这儿有厂规，说一个部门的负责人不得跟本部门女工有任何来往……可我是说在厂外嘛。不过，不管怎么说，我还是希望你和我见见面，好不好? \n \n 你要知道，\"他迷人而又哄诱地冲她的眼睛笑着说，\"打从你来这儿之后，我一直在想你，几乎快疯了，而在那个星期天之后，也就更糟了。现在，我可不让在你我之间还有什么老的条条框框。那你说呢? \n \n \"\"哦，我也不知道……\"罗伯达回答说。如今，她如愿以偿之后，却对她自己这种胆大妄为反而感到害怕了。她忐忑不安地举目四望，觉得打印间里每一只眼睛都在直瞅着她。\"我住在牛顿夫妇那里，您知道，他们就是我那个女友的姐姐。姐夫，而且他们循规蹈矩，严格得很。要是在……就不一样了，\"她原来想说，\"要是在我自个儿家里\"，可是，克莱德把她的话儿给打断了。 \n \n \"哦，千万请你别说不，好吗? \n \n 请你千万不要这样说。我非要见你不可。我不会给你添什么麻烦，这就得了。要不然，我也乐于上你家去找你。你明白就这么回事。\"\"哦，不，您千万别那样，\"罗伯达提醒他。\"反正现在还不行。\"这时她心里乱糟糟，无意之中让克莱德知道: \n \n 她正巴不得他过了一阵子去看她。 \n \n \"好吧，\"克莱德微微一笑。他看出她已经部分让步了。\"如果你愿意的话，我们不妨在这儿街上……就在你住的那一条街上溜达溜达。反正街的尽头，也没有什么房子了。不然的话，就去那个小公园……莫霍克……正好在莫霍克街上\u0027 \n \n \u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027梦乡，以西。就在河边。你不妨上那儿去。我会在电车站等你。你说这样好吗? \n \n \"\"哦，我觉得有点儿害怕……我这是说走得太远了。我从来都没有这样过。\"她说话时显得那么天真坦率，克莱德不由得被她迷人的神态倾倒了。只要想一想，他这是在跟她约定幽会啊。\"在这儿，不管上哪儿，我就怕独个儿去，您知道吧。人们都说，这儿的人净爱说风言风语，而且，不用说，肯定有人会看见我。不过……\"\"是啊，不过怎么啦? \n \n \"\"我担心我在您这儿待得时间太久了，您说是吧? \n \n \"她说这话时，真的有点儿上气不接下气了。克莱德心里明白她说这些话够坦率了，尽管其中并没有什么异乎寻常之处，于是就急忙用一种强有力的语调说: \n \n \"好吧，那末，就在你住的那条街的尽头见面，好吗? \n \n 今天晚上，你能不能去那里，只待一会儿……比方说，半个钟头左右，好吗? \n \n \"\"哦，今天晚上我去不成，我说……不要那么快。您知道，我首先得想一想。 \n \n 也就是说，要安排一下。不过改天再说。\"她这次异乎寻常的冒险举动，已使自己显得那么激动不安，她脸上的神情，如同克莱德常有的那样，一忽儿在微笑，一忽儿却又蹙紧眉头。连她自己都不知道脸上所出现的这些变化。 \n \n \"得了，那末，星期三晚上八点半，或是九点钟，怎么样? \n \n 这样你总可以来吧? \n \n 那就一言为定。\"罗伯达可真是惴惴不安地考虑了一下。这时她的举止仪态，早已使克莱德神魂颠倒，因为她往四下里张望了一下，她意识到，或则她觉得: \n \n 人家都在直瞅着自己呢，她第一次上这儿来，时间待得太长了。 \n \n \"依我看，现在我还得回去干活啦，\"她回答说，但并没有真正回答他的问题。 \n \n \"等一会儿，\"克莱德恳求说。\"我们还没有讲定星期三具体时间呢。你不是要来见我吗? \n \n 讲定九点或是八点半，或是依你看什么时间就得了。反正八点以后，我就在那里等你。你说好吗? \n \n \"\"好吧，那末，就定在八点半，或是在八点半到九点之间，要是我来得了的话。这样总可以吧! \n \n 您知道，要是我来得了，我一定会来的;要是临时有什么事的话，明早我就会告诉您，好吧。\"她一下子脸红了，又往四下里张望了一下，现出愚不可及而又惊慌失措的神色，就急急乎奔回到自己座位上，从头到脚，浑身上下震颤，好象正在犯罪作案时当场被人抓住似的。这时，克莱德坐在办公桌旁，兴奋得几乎喘不过气来。他就是那样跟她谈了话，她也一口答应了，在这个人人都知道他的莱柯格斯，他跟她约定了幽会的时间，这不是奇迹吗! \n \n 多么让人激动! \n \n 至于她呢，这时却在暗自思忖，跟他在月光下散散步，谈谈心，感到他的胳臂正挽着她，同时在倾听他那温言款语，该有多美啊。 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16672.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
