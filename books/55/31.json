{"id":1639,"no":31,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 12","content":"The import of twenty-five dollars a week! Of being the head of a department employing twenty-five girls! Ofwearing a good suit of clothes again! Sitting at an official desk in a corner commanding a charming river viewand feeling that at last, after almost two months in that menial department below stairs, he was a figure of someconsequence in this enormous institution! And because of his relationship and new dignity, Whiggam, as well asLiggett, hovering about with advice and genial and helpful comments from time to time. And some of themanagers of the other departments including several from the front office--an auditor and an advertising manoccasionally pausing in passing to say hello. And the details of the work sufficiently mastered to permit him tolook about him from time to time, taking an interest in the factory as a whole, its processes and supplies, such aswhere the great volume of linen and cotton came from, how it was cut in an enormous cutting room above thisone, holding hundreds of experienced cutters receiving very high wages; how there was an employment bureaufor recruiting help, a company doctor, a company hospital, a special dining room in the main building, where theofficials of the company were allowed to dine--but no others--and that he, being an accredited department headcould now lunch with those others in that special restaurant if he chose and could afford to. Also he soon learnedthat several miles out from Lycurgus, on the Mohawk, near a hamlet called Van Troup, was an inter-factorycountry club, to which most of the department heads of the various factories about belonged, but, alas, as he alsolearned, Griffiths and Company did not really favor their officials mixing with those of any other company, andfor that reason few of them did. Yet he, being a member of the family, as Liggett once said to him, could probably do as he chose as to that. But he decided, because of the strong warnings of Gilbert, as well as his highblood relations with his family, that he had better remain as aloof as possible. And so smiling and being as genialas possible to all, nevertheless for the most part, and in order to avoid Dillard and others of his ilk, and althoughhe was much more lonely than otherwise he would have been, returning to his room or the public squares of thisand near-by cities on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and even, since he thought this might please his uncle andcousin and so raise him in their esteem, beginning to attend one of the principal Presbyterian churches--theSecond or High Street Church, to which on occasion, as he had already learned, the Griffiths themselves wereaccustomed to resort. Yet without ever coming in contact with them in person, since from June to Septemberthey spent their week-ends at Greenwood Lake, to which most of the society life of this region as yet resorted.\n 　　In fact the summer life of Lycurgus, in so far as its society was concerned, was very dull. Nothing in particularever eventuated then in the city, although previous to this, in May, there had been various affairs in connectionwith the Griffiths and their friends which Clyde had either read about or saw at a distance--a graduationreception and dance at the Snedeker School, a lawn fete upon the Griffiths\u0027 grounds, with a striped marquee tenton one part of the lawn and Chinese lanterns hung in among the trees. Clyde had observed this quite by accidentone evening as he was walking alone about the city. It raised many a curious and eager thought in regard to thisfamily, its high station and his relation to it. But having placed him comfortably in a small official position whichwas not arduous, the Griffiths now proceeded to dismiss him from their minds. He was doing well enough, andthey would see something more of him later, perhaps.\n 　　And then a little later he read in the Lycurgus Star that there was to be staged on June twentieth the annual intercityautomobile floral parade and contest (Fonda, Gloversville, Amsterdam and Schenectady), which this yearwas to be held in Lycurgus and which was the last local social affair of any consequence, as The Star phrased it,before the annual hegira to the lakes and mountains of those who were able to depart for such places. And thenames of Bella, Bertine and Sondra, to say nothing of Gilbert, were mentioned as contestants or defendants ofthe fair name of Lycurgus. And since this occurred on a Saturday afternoon, Clyde, dressed in his best, yetdecidedly wishing to obscure himself as an ordinary spectator, was able to see once more the girl who had soinfatuated him on sight, obviously breasting a white rose-surfaced stream and guiding her craft with a paddlecovered with yellow daffodils--a floral representation of some Indian legend in connection with the MohawkRiver. With her dark hair filleted Indian fashion with a yellow feather and brown-eyed susans, she was arrestingenough not only to capture a prize, but to recapture Clyde\u0027s fancy. How marvelous to be of that world.\n 　　In the same parade he had seen Gilbert Griffiths accompanied by a very attractive girl chauffeuring one of fourfloats representing the four seasons. And while the one he drove was winter, with this local society girl posed inermine with white roses for snow all about, directly behind came another float, which presented Bella Griffithsas spring, swathed in filmy draperies and crouching beside a waterfall of dark violets. The effect was quitestriking and threw Clyde into a mood in regard to love, youth and romance which was delicious and yet verypainful to him. Perhaps he should have retained Rita, after all.\n 　　In the meantime he was living on as before, only more spaciously in so far as his own thoughts were concerned.\n 　　For his first thought after receiving this larger allowance was that he had better leave Mrs. Cuppy\u0027s and secure abetter room in some private home which, if less advantageously situated for him, would be in a better street. Ittook him out of all contact with Dillard. And now, since his uncle had promoted him, some representative of hisor Gilbert\u0027s might wish to stop by to see him about something. And what would one such think if he found him living in a small room such as he now occupied?\n 　　Ten days after his salary was raised, therefore, and because of the import of his name, he found it possible toobtain a room in one of the better houses and streets--Jefferson Avenue, which paralleled Wykeagy Avenue, onlya few blocks farther out. It was the home of a widow whose husband had been a mill manager and who let outtwo rooms without board in order to be able to maintain this home, which was above the average for one of suchposition in Lycurgus. And Mrs. Peyton, having long been a resident of the city and knowing much about theGriffiths, recognized not only the name but the resemblance of Clyde to Gilbert. And being intensely interestedby this, as well as his general appearance, she at once offered him an exceptional room for so little as five dollarsa week, which he took at once.\n 　　In connection with his work at the factory, however, and in spite of the fact that he had made such drasticresolutions in regard to the help who were beneath him, still it was not always possible for him to keep his mindon the mere mechanical routine of the work or off of this company of girls as girls, since at least a few of themwere attractive. For it was summer--late June. And over all the factory, especially around two, three and four inthe afternoon, when the endless repetition of the work seemed to pall on all, a practical indifference not remotefrom languor and in some instances sensuality, seemed to creep over the place. There were so many women andgirls of so many different types and moods. And here they were so remote from men or idle pleasure in any form,all alone with just him, really. Again the air within the place was nearly always heavy and physically relaxing,and through the many open windows that reached from floor to ceiling could be seen the Mohawk swirling andrippling, its banks carpeted with green grass and in places shaded by trees. Always it seemed to hint of pleasureswhich might be found by idling along its shores. And since these workers were employed so mechanically as toleave their minds free to roam from one thought of pleasure to another, they were for the most part thinking ofthemselves always and what they would do, assuming that they were not here chained to this routine.\n 　　And because their moods were so brisk and passionate, they were often prone to fix on the nearest object. Andsince Clyde was almost always the only male present--and in these days in his best clothes--they were inclined tofix on him. They were, indeed, full of all sorts of fantastic notions in regard to his private relations with theGriffiths and their like, where he lived and how, whom in the way of a girl he might be interested in. And he, inturn, when not too constrained by the memory of what Gilbert Griffiths had said to him, was inclined to think ofthem--certain girls in particular--with thoughts that bordered on the sensual. For, in spite of the wishes of theGriffiths Company, and the discarded Rita or perhaps because of her, he found himself becoming interested inthree different girls here. They were of a pagan and pleasure-loving turn--this trio--and they thought Clyde veryhandsome. Ruza Nikoforitch--a Russian-American girl--big and blonde and animal, with swimming brown eyes,a snub fat nose and chin, was very much drawn to him. Only, such was the manner with which he carried himselfalways, that she scarcely dared to let herself think so. For to her, with his hair so smoothly parted, torsoed in abright-striped shirt, the sleeves of which in this weather were rolled to the elbows, he seemed almost too perfectto be real. She admired his clean, brown polished shoes, his brightly buckled black leather belt, and the loosefour-in-hand tie he wore.\n 　　Again there was Martha Bordaloue, a stocky, brisk Canadian-French girl of trim, if rotund, figure and ankles,hair of a reddish gold and eyes of greenish blue with puffy pink cheeks and hands that were plump and yet small.\n 　　Ignorant and pagan, she saw in Clyde some one whom, even for so much as an hour, assuming that he would, shewould welcome--and that most eagerly. At the same time, being feline and savage, she hated all or any who even so much as presumed to attempt to interest him, and despised Ruza for that reason. For as she could see Ruzatried to nudge or lean against Clyde whenever he came sufficiently near. At the same time she herself sought byevery single device known to her--her shirtwaist left open to below the borders of her white breast, her outer skirtlifted trimly above her calves when working, her plump round arms displayed to the shoulders to show him thatphysically at least she was worth his time. And the sly sighs and languorous looks when he was near, whichcaused Ruza to exclaim one day: \"That French cat! He should look at her!\" And because of Clyde she had anintense desire to strike her.\n 　　And yet again there was the stocky and yet gay Flora Brandt, a decidedly low class American type of coarse andyet enticing features, black hair, large, swimming and heavily-lashed black eyes, a snub nose and full andsensuous and yet pretty lips, and a vigorous and not ungraceful body, who, from day to day, once he had beenthere a little while, had continued to look at him as if to say--\"What! You don\u0027t think I\u0027m attractive?\" and with alook which said: \"How can you continue to ignore me? There are lots of fellows who would be delighted to haveyour chance, I can tell you.\"And, in connection with these three, the thought came to him after a time that since they were so different, morecommon as he thought, less well-guarded and less sharply interested in the conventional aspects of their contacts,it might be possible and that without detection on the part of any one for him to play with one or another ofthem--or all three in turn if his interest should eventually carry him so far--without being found out, particularlyif beforehand he chose to impress on them the fact that he was condescending when he noticed them at all. Mostcertainly, if he could judge by their actions, they would willingly reward him by letting him have his way withthem somewhere, and think nothing of it afterward if he chose to ignore them, as he must to keep his positionhere. Nevertheless, having given his word as he had to Gilbert Griffiths, he was still in no mood to break it.\n 　　These were merely thoughts which from time to time were aroused in him by a situation which for him wasdifficult in the extreme. His was a disposition easily and often intensely inflamed by the chemistry of sex and theformula of beauty. He could not easily withstand the appeal, let alone the call, of sex. And by the actions andapproaches of each in turn he was surely tempted at times, especially in these warm and languorous summerdays, with no place to go and no single intimate to commune with. From time to time he could not resist drawingnear to these very girls who were most bent on tempting him, although in the face of their looks and nudges, notvery successfully concealed at times, he maintained an aloofness and an assumed indifference which was quiteremarkable for him.\n 　　But just about this time there was a rush of orders, which necessitated, as both Whiggam and Liggett advised,Clyde taking on a few extra \"try-out\" girls who were willing to work for the very little they could earn at thecurrent piece work rate until they had mastered the technique, when of course they would be able to earn more.\n 　　There were many such who applied at the employment branch of the main office on the ground floor. In slacktimes all applications were rejected or the sign hung up \"No Help Wanted.\"And since Clyde was relatively new to this work, and thus far had neither hired nor discharged any one, it wasagreed between Whiggam and Liggett that all the help thus sent up should first be examined by Liggett, who waslooking for extra stitchers also. And in case any were found who promised to be satisfactory as stampers, theywere to be turned over to Clyde with the suggestion that he try them. Only before bringing any one back toClyde, Liggett was very careful to explain that in connection with this temporary hiring and discharging therewas a system. One must not ever give a new employee, however well they did, the feeling that they were doing anything but moderately well until their capacity had been thoroughly tested. It interfered with their properdevelopment as piece workers, the greatest results that could be obtained by any one person. Also one mightfreely take on as many girls as were needed to meet any such situation, and then, once the rush was over, asfreely drop them--unless, occasionally, a very speedy worker was found among the novices. In that case it wasalways advisable to try to retain such a person, either by displacing a less satisfactory person or transferring someone from some other department, to make room for new blood and new energy.\n 　　The next day, after this notice of a rush, back came four girls at different times and escorted always by Liggett,who in each instance explained to Clyde: \"Here\u0027s a girl who might do for you. Miss Tyndal is her name. Youmight give her a try-out.\" Or, \"You might see if this girl will be of any use to you.\" And Clyde, after he hadquestioned them as to where they had worked, what the nature of the general working experiences were, andwhether they lived at home here in Lycurgus or alone (the bachelor girl was not much wanted by the factory)would explain the nature of the work and pay, and then call Miss Todd, who in her turn would first take them tothe rest room where were lockers for their coats, and then to one of the tables where they would be shown whatthe process was. And later it was Miss Todd\u0027s and Clyde\u0027s business to discover how well they were getting onand whether it was worth while to retain them or not.\n 　　Up to this time, apart from the girls to whom he was so definitely drawn, Clyde was not so very favorablyimpressed with the type of girl who was working here. For the most part, as he saw them, they were of a heavyand rather unintelligent company, and he had been thinking that smarter-looking girls might possibly be secured.\n 　　Why not? Were there none in Lycurgus in the factory world? So many of these had fat hands, broad faces, heavylegs and ankles. Some of them even spoke with an accent, being Poles or the children of Poles, living in thatslum north of the mill. And they were all concerned with catching a \"feller,\" going to some dancing place withhim afterwards, and little more. Also, Clyde had noticed that the American types who were here were of adecidedly different texture, thinner, more nervous and for the most part more angular, and with a general reservedue to prejudices, racial, moral and religious, which would not permit them to mingle with these others or withany men, apparently.\n 　　But among the extras or try-outs that were brought to him during this and several succeeding days, finally cameone who interested Clyde more than any girl whom he had seen here so far. She was, as he decided on sight,more intelligent and pleasing--more spiritual--though apparently not less vigorous, if more gracefullyproportioned. As a matter of fact, as he saw her at first, she appeared to him to possess a charm which no oneelse in this room had, a certain wistfulness and wonder combined with a kind of self-reliant courage anddetermination which marked her at once as one possessed of will and conviction to a degree. Nevertheless, as shesaid, she was inexperienced in this kind of work, and highly uncertain as to whether she would prove of servicehere or anywhere.\n 　　Her name was Roberta Alden, and, as she at once explained, previous to this she had been working in a smallhosiery factory in a town called Trippetts Mills fifty miles north of Lycurgus. She had on a small brown hat thatdid not look any too new, and was pulled low over a face that was small and regular and pretty and that washaloed by bright, light brown hair. Her eyes were of a translucent gray blue. Her little suit was commonplace,and her shoes were not so very new-looking and quite solidly-soled. She looked practical and serious and yet sobright and clean and willing and possessed of so much hope and vigor that along with Liggett, who had firsttalked with her, he was at once taken with her. Distinctly she was above the average of the girls in this room.\n 　　And he could not help wondering about her as he talked to her, for she seemed so tense, a little troubled as to theoutcome of this interview, as though this was a very great adventure for her.\n 　　She explained that up to this time she had been living with her parents near a town called Biltz, but was nowliving with friends here. She talked so honestly and simply that Clyde was very much moved by her, and for thisreason wished to help her. At the same time he wondered if she were not really above the type of work she wasseeking. Her eyes were so round and blue and intelligent--her lips and nose and ears and hands so small andpleasing.\n 　　\"You\u0027re going to live in Lycurgus, then, if you can get work here?\" he said, more to be talking to her thananything else.\n 　　\"Yes,\" she said, looking at him most directly and frankly.\n 　　\"And the name again?\" He took down a record pad.\n 　　\"Roberta Alden.\"\"And your address here?\"\"228 Taylor Street.\"\"I don\u0027t even know where that is myself,\" he informed her because he liked talking to her. \"I haven\u0027t been here sovery long, you see.\" He wondered just why afterwards he had chosen to tell her as much about himself so swiftly.\n 　　Then he added: \"I don\u0027t know whether Mr. Liggett has told you all about the work here. But it\u0027s piece work, youknow, stamping collars. I\u0027ll show you if you\u0027ll just step over here,\" and he led the way to a near-by table wherethe stampers were. After letting her observe how it was done, and without calling Miss Todd, he picked up oneof the collars and proceeded to explain all that had been previously explained to him.\n 　　At the same time, because of the intentness with which she observed him and his gestures, the seriousness withwhich she appeared to take all that he said, he felt a little nervous and embarrassed. There was something quitesearching and penetrating about her glance. After he had explained once more what the bundle rate was, and howmuch some made and how little others, and she had agreed that she would like to try, he called Miss Todd, whotook her to the locker room to hang up her hat and coat. Then presently he saw her returning, a fluff of light hairabout her forehead, her cheeks slightly flushed, her eyes very intent and serious. And as advised by Miss Todd,he saw her turn back her sleeves, revealing a pretty pair of forearms. Then she fell to, and by her gestures Clydeguessed that she would prove both speedy and accurate. For she seemed most anxious to obtain and keep thisplace.\n 　　After she had worked a little while, he went to her side and watched her as she picked up and stamped the collarspiled beside her and threw them to one side. Also the speed and accuracy with which she did it. Then, becausefor a second she turned and looked at him, giving him an innocent and yet cheerful and courageous smile, hesmiled back, most pleased.\n 　　\"Well, I guess you\u0027ll make out all right,\" he ventured to say, since he could not help feeling that she would. Andinstantly, for a second only, she turned and smiled again. And Clyde, in spite of himself, was quite thrilled. Heliked her on the instant, but because of his own station here, of course, as he now decided, as well as his promiseto Gilbert, he must be careful about being congenial with any of the help in this room--even as charming a girl asthis. It would not do. He had been guarding himself in connection with the others and must with her too, a thingwhich seemed a little strange to him then, for he was very much drawn to her. She was so pretty and cute. Yetshe was a working girl, as he remembered now, too--a factory girl, as Gilbert would say, and he was her superior.\n 　　But she WAS so pretty and cute.\n 　　Instantly he went on to others who had been put on this same day, and finally coming to Miss Todd asked her toreport pretty soon on how Miss Alden was getting along--that he wanted to know.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16668.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
