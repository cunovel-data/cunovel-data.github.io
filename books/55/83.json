{"id":1691,"no":83,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 17","content":"The struggle and excitement of a great murder trial! Belknap and Jephson, after consulting with Brookhart andCatchuman, learning that they considered Jephson\u0027s plan \"perhaps the only way,\" but with as little reference tothe Griffiths as possible.\\n\\n 　　And then at once, Messrs. Belknap and Jephson issuing preliminary statements framed in such a manner as toshow their faith in Clyde, presenting him as being, in reality, a much maligned and entirely misunderstood youth, whose intentions and actions toward Miss Alden were as different from those set forth by Mason as white fromblack. And intimating that the undue haste of the district attorney in seeking a special term of the Supreme Courtmight possibly have a political rather than a purely legal meaning. Else why the hurry, especially in the face ofan approaching county election? Could there be any plan to use the results of such a trial as this to further anyparticular person\u0027s, or group of persons\u0027, political ambitions? Messrs. Belknap and Jephson begged to hope not.\\n\\n 　　But regardless of such plans or the prejudices or the political aspirations of any particular person or group, thedefense in this instance did not propose to permit a boy as innocent as Clyde, trapped by circumstances--ascounsel for the defense would be prepared to show--to be railroaded to the electric chair merely to achieve avictory for the Republican party in November. Furthermore, to combat these strange and yet false circumstances,the defense would require a considerable period of time to prepare its case. Therefore, it would be necessary forthem to file a formal protest at Albany against the district attorney\u0027s request to the governor for a special term ofthe Supreme Court. There was no need for the same, since the regular term for the trial of such cases would fallin January, and the preparation of their case would require that much time.\\n\\n 　　But while this strong, if rather belated, reply was listened to with proper gravity by the representatives of thevarious newspapers, Mason vigorously pooh-poohed this \"windy\" assertion of political plotting, as well as thetalk of Clyde\u0027s innocence. \"What reason have I, a representative of all the people of this county, to railroad thisman anywhere or make one single charge against him unless the charges make themselves? Doesn\u0027t the evidenceitself show that he did kill this girl? And has he ever said or done one thing to clear up any of the suspiciouscircumstances? No! Silence or lies. And until these circumstances are disproved by these very able gentlemen, Iam going right ahead. I have all the evidence necessary to convict this young criminal now. And to delay it untilJanuary, when I shall be out of office, as they know, and when a new man will have to go over all this evidencewith which I have familiarized myself, is to entail great expense to the county. For all the witnesses I have gottentogether are right here now, easy to bring into Bridgeburg without any great expense to the county. But wherewill they be next January or February, especially after the defense has done its best to scatter them? No, sir! Iwill not agree to it. But, if within ten days or two weeks from now even, they can bring me something that willso much as make it look as though even some of the charges I have made are not true, I\u0027ll be perfectly willing togo before the presiding judge with them, and if they can show him any evidence they have or hope to have, orthat there are any distant known witnesses to be secured who can help prove this fellow\u0027s innocence, why, then,well and good. I\u0027ll be willing to ask the judge to grant them as much time as he may see fit, even if it throws thetrial over until I am out of office. But if the trial comes up while I\u0027m here, as I honestly hope it will, I\u0027ll prosecuteit to the best of my ability, not because I\u0027m looking for an office of any kind but because I am now the districtattorney and it is my duty to do so. And as for my being in politics, well, Mr. Belknap is in politics, isn\u0027t he? Heran against me the last time, and I hear he desires to run again.\"Accordingly he proceeded to Albany further to impress upon the Governor the very great need of an immediatespecial term of the Court so that Clyde might be indicted. And the Governor, hearing the personal arguments ofboth Mason and Belknap, decided in favor of Mason, on the ground that the granting of a special term did notmilitate against any necessary delay of the trial of the case, since nothing which the defense as yet had to offerseemed to indicate that the calling of a special term was likely in any way to prevent it from obtaining as muchtime wherein to try the case as needed. Besides, it would be the business of the Supreme Court justice appointedto consider such arguments--not himself. And accordingly, a special term of the Supreme Court was ordered,with one Justice Frederick Oberwaltzer of the eleventh judicial district designated to preside. And when Mason appeared before him with the request that he fix the date of the Special Grand Jury by which Clyde might beindicted, this was set for August fifth.\\n\\n 　　And then that body sitting, it was no least trouble for Mason to have Clyde indicted.\\n\\n 　　And thereafter the best that Belknap and Jephson could do was to appear before Oberwaltzer, a Democrat, whoowed his appointment to a previous governor, to argue for a change of venue, on the ground that by no possiblestretch of the imagination could any twelve men residing in Cataraqui County be found who, owing to the publicand private statements of Mason, were not already vitally opposed to Clyde and so convinced of his guilt thatbefore ever such a jury could be addressed by a defense, he would be convicted.\\n\\n 　　\"But where are you going then?\" inquired Justice Oberwaltzer, who was impartial enough. \"The same materialhas been published everywhere.\"\"But, your Honor, this crime which the district attorney here has been so busy in magnifying--\" (a long andheated objection on the part of Mason).\\n\\n 　　\"But we contend just the same,\" continued Belknap, \"that the public has been unduly stirred and deluded. Youcan\u0027t get twelve men now who will try this man fairly.\"\"What nonsense!\" exclaimed Mason, angrily. \"Mere twaddle! Why, the newspapers themselves have gatheredand published more evidence than I have. It\u0027s the publicly discovered facts in this case that have arousedprejudice, if any has been aroused. But no more than would be aroused anywhere, I maintain. Besides, if thiscase is to be transferred to a distant county when the majority of the witnesses are right here, this county is goingto be saddled with an enormous expense, which it cannot afford and which the facts do not warrant.\"Justice Oberwaltzer, who was of a sober and moral turn, a slow and meticulous man inclined to favorconservative procedure in all things, was inclined to agree. And after five days, in which he did not more thanmuse idly upon the matter, he decided to deny the motion. If he were wrong, there was the Appellate Division towhich the defense could resort. As for stays, having fixed the date of the trial for October fifteenth (ample time,as he judged, for the defense to prepare its case), he adjourned for the remainder of the summer to his cottage onBlue Mountain Lake, where both the prosecution and the defense, should any knotty or locally insoluble legalcomplication arise, would be able to find him and have his personal attention.\\n\\n 　　But with the entry of the Messrs. Belknap and Jephson into the case, Mason found it advisable to redouble hisefforts to make positive, in so far as it were possible, the conviction of Clyde. He feared the young Jephson asmuch as he did Belknap. And for that reason, taking with him Burton Burleigh and Earl Newcomb, he nowrevisited Lycurgus, where among other things he was able to discover (1) where Clyde had purchased thecamera; (2) that three days before his departure for Big Bittern he had said to Mrs. Peyton that he was thinking oftaking his camera with him and that he must get some films for it; (3) that there was a haberdasher by the nameof Orrin Short who had known Clyde well and that but four months before Clyde had applied to him for advicein connection with a factory hand\u0027s pregnant wife--also (and this in great confidence to Burton Burleigh, who hadunearthed him) that he had recommended to Clyde a certain Dr. Glenn, near Gloversville; (4) Dr. Glenn himselfbeing sought and pictures of Clyde and Roberta being submitted, he was able to identify Roberta, although not Clyde, and to describe the state of mind in which she had approached him, as well as the story she had told--astory which in no way incriminated Clyde or herself, and which, therefore, Mason decided might best be ignored,for the present, anyhow.\\n\\n 　　And (5), via these same enthusiastic efforts, there rose to the surface the particular hat salesman in Utica who hadsold Clyde the hat. For Burton Burleigh being interviewed while in Utica, and his picture published along withone of Clyde, this salesman chanced to see it and recalling him at once made haste to communicate with Mason,with the result that his testimony, properly typewritten and sworn to, was carried away by Mason.\\n\\n 　　And, in addition, the country girl who had been on the steamer \"Cygnus\" and who had noticed Clyde, wroteMason that she remembered him wearing a straw hat, also his leaving the boat at Sharon, a bit of evidence whichmost fully confirmed that of the captain of the boat and caused Mason to feel that Providence or Fate wasworking with him. And last, but most important of all to him, there came a communication from a womanresiding in Bedford, Pennsylvania, who announced that during the week of July third to tenth, she and herhusband had been camping on the east shore of Big Bittern, near the southern end of the lake. And while rowingon the lake on the afternoon of July eighth, at about six o\u0027clock, she had heard a cry which sounded like that of awoman or girl in distress--a plaintive, mournful cry. It was very faint and had seemed to come from beyond theisland which was to the south and west of the bay in which they were fishing.\\n\\n 　　Mason now proposed to remain absolutely silent regarding this information, and that about the camera and filmsand the data regarding Clyde\u0027s offense in Kansas City, until nearer the day of trial, or during the trial itself, whenit would be impossible for the defense to attempt either to refute or ameliorate it in any way.\\n\\n 　　As for Belknap and Jephson, apart from drilling Clyde in the matter of his general denial based on his change ofheart once he had arrived at Grass Lake, and the explanation of the two hats and the bag, they could not see thatthere was much to do. True, there was the suit thrown in Fourth Lake near the Cranstons\u0027, but after much trollingon the part of a seemingly casual fisherman, that was brought up, cleaned and pressed, and now hung in a lockedcloset in the Belknap and Jephson office. Also, there was the camera at Big Bittern, dived for but never found bythem--a circumstance which led Jephson to conclude that Mason must have it, and so caused him to decide thathe would refer to it at the earliest possible opportunity at the trial. But as for Clyde striking her with it, evenaccidentally, well, it was decided at that time at least, to contend that he had not--although after exhumingRoberta\u0027s body at Biltz it had been found that the marks on her face, even at this date, did correspond in somedegree to the size and shape of the camera.\\n\\n 　　For, in the first place, they were exceedingly dubious of Clyde as a witness. Would he or would he not, in tellingof how it all happened, be sufficiently direct or forceful and sincere to convince any jury that he had so struckher without intending to strike her? For on that, marks or no marks, would depend whether the jury was going tobelieve him. And if it did not believe that he struck her accidentally, then a verdict of guilty, of course.\\n\\n 　　And so they prepared to await the coming of the trial, only working betimes and in so far as they dared, to obtaintestimony or evidence as to Clyde\u0027s previous good character, but being blocked to a degree by the fact that inLycurgus, while pretending to be a model youth outwardly, he had privately been conducting himself otherwise,and that in Kansas City his first commercial efforts had resulted in such a scandal.\\n\\n 　　However, one of the most difficult matters in connection with Clyde and his incarceration here, as Belknap andJephson as well as the prosecution saw it, was the fact that thus far not one single member of his own or hisuncle\u0027s family had come forward to champion him. And to no one save Belknap and Jephson had he admittedwhere his parents were. Yet would it not be necessary, as both Belknap and Jephson argued from time to time, ifany case at all were to be made out for him, to have his mother or father, or at least a sister or a brother, comeforward to say a good word for him? Otherwise, Clyde might appear to be a pariah, one who had been from thefirst a drifter and a waster and was now purposely being avoided by all who knew him.\\n\\n 　　For this reason, at their conference with Darrah Brookhart they had inquired after Clyde\u0027s parents and hadlearned that in so far as the Griffiths of Lycurgus were concerned, there lay a deep objection to bringing on anymember of this western branch of the family. There was, as he explained, a great social gap between them, whichit would not please the Lycurgus Griffiths to have exploited here. Besides, who could say but that once Clyde\u0027sparents were notified or discovered by the yellow press, they might not lend themselves to exploitation. BothSamuel and Gilbert Griffiths, as Brookhart now informed Belknap, had suggested that it was best, if Clyde didnot object, to keeping his immediate relatives in the background. In fact, on this, in some measure at least, waslikely to depend the extent of their financial aid to Clyde.\\n\\n 　　Clyde was in accord with this wish of the Griffiths, although no one who talked with him sufficiently or heardhim express how sorry he was on his mother\u0027s account that all this had happened, could doubt the quality of theblood and emotional tie that held him and his mother together. The complete truth was that his present attitudetoward her was a mixture of fear and shame because of the manner in which she was likely to view hispredicament--his moral if not his social failure. Would she be willing to believe the story prepared by Belknapand Jephson as to his change of heart? But even apart from that, to have her come here now and look at himthrough these bars when he was so disgraced--to be compelled to face her and talk to her day after day! Herclear, inquiring, tortured eyes! Her doubt as to his innocence, since he could feel that even Belknap and Jephson,in spite of all their plans for him, were still a little dubious as to that unintentional blow of his. They did notreally believe it, and they might tell her that. And would his religious, God-fearing, crime-abhorring mother bemore credulous than they?\\n\\n 　　Being asked again what he thought ought to be done about his parents, he replied that he did not believe he couldface his mother yet--it would do no good and would only torture both.\\n\\n 　　And fortunately, as he saw it, apparently no word of all that had befallen him had yet reached his parents inDenver. Because of their peculiar religious and moral beliefs, all copies of worldly and degenerate daily paperswere consistently excluded from their home and Mission. And the Lycurgus Griffiths had had no desire toinform them.\\n\\n 　　Yet one night, at about the time that Belknap and Jephson were most seriously debating the absence of hisparents and what, if anything, should be done about it, Esta, who some time after Clyde had arrived in Lycurgushad married and was living in the southeast portion of Denver, chanced to read in The Rocky Mountain News-andthis just subsequent to Clyde\u0027s indictment by the Grand Jury at Bridgeburg:\\n\\n 　　\"BOY SLAYER OF WORKING GIRL INDICTED\"Bridgeburg, N. Y., Aug. 6: A special Grand Jury appointed by Governor Stouderback, of this state, to sit in thecase of Clyde Griffiths, the nephew of the wealthy collar manufacturer of the same name, of Lycurgus, NewYork, recently charged with the killing of Miss Roberta Alden, of Biltz, New York, at Big Bittern Lake in theAdirondacks on July 8th last, to-day returned an indictment charging murder in the first degree.\\n\\n 　　\"Subsequent to the indictment, Griffiths, who in spite of almost overwhelming evidence, has persisted inasserting that the alleged crime was an accident, and who, accompanied by his counsel, Alvin Belknap, andReuben Jephson, of this city, was arraigned before Supreme Court Justice Oberwaltzer, pleaded not guilty. Hewas remanded for trial, which was set for October 15th.\\n\\n 　　\"Young Griffiths, who is only twenty-two years of age, and up to the day of his arrest a respected member ofLycurgus smart society, is alleged to have stunned and then drowned his working-girl sweetheart, whom he hadwronged and then planned to desert in favor of a richer girl. The lawyers in this case have been retained by hiswealthy uncle of Lycurgus, who has hitherto remained aloof. But apart from this, it is locally asserted, no relativehas come forward to aid in his defense.\"Esta forthwith made a hurried departure for her mother\u0027s home. Despite the directness and clarity of this she wasnot willing to believe it was Clyde. Still there was the damning force of geography and names--the rich LycurgusGriffiths, the absence of his own relatives.\\n\\n 　　As quickly as the local street car would carry her, she now presented herself at the combined lodging house andmission known as the \"Star of Hope,\" in Bildwell Street, which was scarcely better than that formerly maintainedin Kansas City. For while it provided a number of rooms for wayfarers at twenty-five cents a night, and wassupposed to be self-supporting, it entailed much work with hardly any more profit. Besides, by now, both Frankand Julia, who long before this had become irked by the drab world in which they found themselves, hadearnestly sought to free themselves of it, leaving the burden of the mission work on their father and mother.\\n\\n 　　Julia, now nineteen, was cashiering for a local downtown restaurant, and Frank, nearing seventeen, had butrecently found work in a fruit and vegetable commission house. In fact, the only child about the place by day waslittle Russell, the illegitimate son of Esta--now between three and four years of age, and most reservedlyfictionalized by his grandparents as an orphan whom they had adopted in Kansas City. He was a dark-hairedchild, in some ways resembling Clyde, who, even at this early age, as Clyde had been before him, was beinginstructed in those fundamental verities which had irritated Clyde in his own childhood.\\n\\n 　　At the time that Esta, now a decidedly subdued and reserved wife, entered, Mrs. Griffiths was busy sweeping anddusting and making up beds. But on sight of her daughter at this unusual hour approaching, and with blanchedcheeks signaling her to come inside the door of a vacant room, Mrs. Griffiths, who, because of years ofdifficulties of various kinds, was more or less accustomed to scenes such as this, now paused in wonder, theswiftly beclouding mist of apprehension shining in her eyes. What new misery or ill was this? For decidedlyEsta\u0027s weak gray eyes and manner indicated distress. And in her hand was folded a paper, which she opened andafter giving her mother a most solicitous look, pointed to the item, toward which Mrs. Griffiths now directed herlook. But what was this?\\n\\n 　　\"BOY SLAYER OF WORKING-GIRL SWEETHEART INDICTED.\"\"CHARGED WITH THE KILLING OF MISS ROBERTA ALDEN AT BIG BITTERN LAKE IN THEADIRONDACKS ON JULY 8 LAST.\"\"RETURNED INDICTMENT CHARGING MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE.\"\"IN SPITE OF ALMOST OVERWHELMING CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.\"\"PLEADED NOT GUILTY.\"\"REMANDED FOR TRIAL.\" \"SET FOR OCTOBER 15.\"\"STUNNED AND DROWNED HIS WORKING-GIRL SWEETHEART.\"\"NO RELATIVE HAS COME FORWARD.\"It was thus that her eye and her mind automatically selected the most essential lines. And then as swiftly goingover them again.\\n\\n 　　\"CLYDE GRIFFITHS, NEPHEW OF THE WEALTHY COLLAR MANUFACTURER OF LYCURGUS, NEWYORK.\"Clyde--her son! And only recently--but no, over a month ago--(and they had been worrying a little as to that, sheand Asa, because he had not--) July 8th! And it was now August 11th! Then--yes! But not her son! Impossible!\\n\\n 　　Clyde the murderer of a girl who was his sweetheart! But he was not like that! He had written to her how he wasgetting along--the head of a large department, with a future. But of no girl. But now! And yet that other little girlthere in Kansas City. Merciful God! And the Griffiths, of Lycurgus, her husband\u0027s brother, knowing of this andnot writing! Ashamed, disgusted, no doubt. Indifferent. But no, he had hired two lawyers. Yet the horror! Asa!\\n\\n 　　Her other children! What the papers would say! This mission! They would have to give it up and go somewhereelse again. Yet was he guilty or not guilty? She must know that before judging or thinking. This paper said hehad pleaded not guilty. Oh, that wretched, worldly, showy hotel in Kansas City! Those other bad boys! Thosetwo years in which he wandered here and there, not writing, passing as Harry Tenet. Doing what? Learningwhat?\\n\\n 　　She paused, full of that intense misery and terror which no faith in the revealed and comforting verities of Godand mercy and salvation which she was always proclaiming, could for the moment fend against. Her boy! HerClyde! In jail, accused of murder! She must wire! She must write! She must go, maybe. But how to get themoney! What to do when she got there. How to get the courage--the faith--to endure it. Yet again, neither Asanor Frank nor Julia must know. Asa, with his protesting and yet somehow careworn faith, his weak eyes andweakening body. And must Frank and Julia, now just starting out in life, be saddled with this? Marked thus?\\n\\n 　　Merciful God! Would her troubles never end?\\n\\n 　　She turned, her big, work-worn hands trembling slightly, shaking the paper she held, while Esta, whosympathized greatly with her mother these days because of all she had been compelled to endure, stood by. She looked so tired at times, and now to be racked by this! Yet, as she knew, her mother was the strongest in thefamily--so erect, so square-shouldered, defiant--a veritable soul pilot in her cross-grained, uniformed way.\\n\\n 　　\"Mamma, I just can\u0027t believe it can be Clyde,\" was all Esta could say now. \"It just can\u0027t be, can it?\"But Mrs. Griffiths merely continued to stare at that ominous headline, then swiftly ran her gray-blue eyes overthe room. Her broad face was blanched and dignified by an enormous strain and an enormous pain. Her erring,misguided, no doubt unfortunate, son, with all his wild dreams of getting on and up, was in danger of death, ofbeing electrocuted for a crime--for murder! He had killed some one--a poor working-girl, the paper said.\\n\\n 　　\"Ssh!\" she whispered, putting one finger to her own lips as a sign. \"He\" (indicating Asa) \"must not know yet,anyhow. We must wire first, or write. You can have the answers come to you, maybe. I will give you the money.\\n\\n 　　But I must sit down somewhere now for a minute. I feel a little weak. I\u0027ll sit here. Let me have the Bible.\"On the small dresser was a Gideon Bible, which, sitting on the edge of the commonplace iron bed, she nowopened instinctively at Psalms 3 and 4.\\n\\n 　　\"Lord, how are they increased that trouble.\"\"Hear me, when I call, O God of my righteousness.\"And then reading on silently, even placidly apparently, through 6, 8, 10, 13, 23, 91, while Esta stood by in silentamazement and misery.\\n\\n 　　\"Oh, Mamma, I just can\u0027t believe it. Oh, this is too terrible!\" But Mrs. Griffiths read on. It was as if, and in spiteof all this, she had been able to retreat into some still, silent place, where, for the time being at least, no evilhuman ill could reach her. Then at last, quite calmly closing the book, and rising, she went on:\\n\\n 　　\"Now, we must think out what to say and who to send that telegram to--I mean to Clyde, of course--at that place,wherever it is--Bridgeburg,\" she added, looking at the paper, and then interpolating from the Bible--\"By terriblethings in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God!\" \"Or, maybe, those two lawyers--their names are there. I\u0027mafraid to wire Asa\u0027s brother for fear he\u0027ll wire back to him.\" (Then: \u0027Thou art my bulwark and my strength. InThee will I trust.\u0027) \"But I suppose they would give it to him if we sent it care of that judge or those lawyers, don\u0027tyou think? But it would be better if we could send it to him direct, I suppose. (\u0027He leadeth me by the still waters.\u0027)Just say that I have read about him and still have faith and love for him, but he is to tell me the truth and what todo. If he needs money we will have to see what we can do, I suppose. (\u0027He restoreth my soul.\u0027)\"And then, despite her sudden peace of the moment, she once more began wringing her large, rough hands. \"Oh, itcan\u0027t be true. Oh, dear, no! After all, he is my son. We all love him and have faith. We must say that. God willdeliver him. Watch and pray. Have faith. Under his wings shalt thou trust.\"She was so beside herself that she scarcely knew what she was saying. And Esta, at her side, was saying: \"Yes,Mamma! Oh, of course! Yes, I will! I know he\u0027ll get it all right.\" But she, too, was saying to herself: \"My God!\\n\\n 　　My God! What could be worse than this--to be accused of murder! But, of course, it can\u0027t be true. It can\u0027t be true.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16835.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
