{"id":1634,"no":26,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 7","content":"In so far as his life at Mrs. Cuppy\u0027s went, he was not so very happily placed there, either. For that was but acommonplace rooming and boarding house, which drew to it, at best, such conservative mill and business typesas looked on work and their wages, and the notions of the middle class religious world of Lycurgus as mostessential to the order and well being of the world. From the point of view of entertainment or gayety, it was inthe main a very dull place. 　　At the same time, because of the presence of one Walter Dillard--a brainless sprig who had recently come herefrom Fonda, it was not wholly devoid of interest for Clyde. The latter--a youth of about Clyde\u0027s own age andequally ambitious socially--but without Clyde\u0027s tact or discrimination anent the governing facts of life, wasconnected with the men\u0027s furnishing department of Stark and Company. He was spry, avid, attractive enoughphysically, with very light hair, a very light and feeble mustache, and the delicate airs and ways of a small townBeau Brummell. Never having had any social standing or the use of any means whatsoever--his father havingbeen a small town dry goods merchant before him, who had failed--he was, because of some atavistic spur orfillip in his own blood, most anxious to attain some sort of social position. 　　But failing that so far, he was interested in and envious of those who had it--much more so than Clyde, even. Theglory and activity of the leading families of this particular city had enormous weight with him--the Nicholsons,the Starks, the Harriets, Griffiths, Finchleys, et cetera. And learning a few days after Clyde\u0027s arrival of hissomewhat left-handed connection with this world, he was most definitely interested. What? A Griffiths! Thenephew of the rich Samuel Griffiths of Lycurgus! And in this boarding house! Beside him at this table! At oncehis interest rose to where he decided that he must cultivate this stranger as speedily as possible. Here was a realsocial opportunity knocking at his very door--a connecting link to one of the very best families! And besides washe not young, attractive and probably ambitious like himself--a fellow to play around with if one could? Heproceeded at once to make overtures to Clyde. It seemed almost too good to be true. 　　In consequence he was quick to suggest a walk, the fact that there was a certain movie just on at the Mohawk,which was excellent--very snappy. Didn\u0027t Clyde want to go? And because of his neatness, smartness--a touch ofsomething that was far from humdrum or the heavy practicality of the mill and the remainder of this boardinghouse world, Clyde was inclined to fall in with him. 　　But, as he now thought, here were his great relatives and he must watch his step here. Who knew but that hemight be making a great mistake in holding such free and easy contacts as this. The Griffiths--as well as the entire world of which they were a part--as he guessed from the general manner of all those who even contactedhim, must be very removed from the commonalty here. More by instinct than reason, he was inclined to stand offand look very superior--more so since those, including this very youth on whom he practised this seemed torespect him the more. And although upon eager--and even--after its fashion, supplicating request, he now wentwith this youth--still he went cautiously. And his aloof and condescending manner Dillard at once translated as\"class\" and \"connection.\" And to think he had met him in this dull, dubby boarding house here. And on hisarrival--at the very inception of his career here. 　　And so his manner was that of the sycophant--although he had a better position and was earning more moneythan Clyde was at this time, twenty-two dollars a week. 　　\"I suppose you\u0027ll be spending a good deal of your time with your relatives and friends here,\" he volunteered onthe occasion of their first walk together, and after he had extracted as much information as Clyde cared to impart,which was almost nothing, while he volunteered a few, most decidedly furbished bits from his own history. Hisfather owned a dry goods store NOW. He had come over here to study other methods, et cetera. He had an unclehere--connected with Stark and Company. He had met a few--not so many as yet--nice people here, since hehadn\u0027t been here so very long himself--four months all told. 　　But Clyde\u0027s relatives! 　　\"Say your uncle must be worth over a million, isn\u0027t he? They say he is. Those houses in Wykeagy Avenue arecertainly the cats\u0027. You won\u0027t see anything finer in Albany or Utica or Rochester either. Are you SamuelGriffiths\u0027 own nephew? You don\u0027t say! Well, that\u0027ll certainly mean a lot to you here. I wish I had a connectionlike that. You bet I\u0027d make it count.\"He beamed on Clyde eagerly and hopefully, and through him Clyde sensed even more how really important thisblood relation was. Only think how much it meant to this strange youth. 　　\"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" replied Clyde dubiously, and yet very much flattered by this assumption of intimacy. \"I cameon to learn the collar business, you know. Not to play about very much. My uncle wants me to stick to that,pretty much.\"\"Sure, sure. I know how that is,\" replied Dillard, \"that\u0027s the way my uncle feels about me, too. He wants me tostick close to the work here and not play about very much. He\u0027s the buyer for Stark and Company, you know. Butstill a man can\u0027t work all the time, either. He\u0027s got to have a little fun.\"\"Yes, that\u0027s right,\" said Clyde--for the first time in his life a little condescendingly. 　　They walked along in silence for a few moments. Then: 　　\"Do you dance?\"\"Yes,\" answered Clyde. 　　\"Well, so do I. There are a lot of cheap dance halls around here, but I never go to any of those. You can\u0027t do itand keep in with the nice people. This is an awfully close town that way, they say. The best people won\u0027t haveanything to do with you unless you go with the right crowd. It\u0027s the same way up at Fonda. You have to \u0027belong\u0027 　　or you can\u0027t go out anywhere at all. And that\u0027s right, I guess. But still there are a lot of nice girls here that afellow can go with--girls of right nice families--not in society, of course--but still, they\u0027re not talked about, see. 　　And they\u0027re not so slow, either. Pretty hot stuff, some of them. And you don\u0027t have to marry any of \u0027em, either.\"Clyde began to think of him as perhaps a little too lusty for his new life here, maybe. At the same time he likedhim some. \"By the way,\" went on Dillard, \"what are you doing next Sunday afternoon?\"\"Well, nothing in particular, that I know of just now,\" replied Clyde, sensing a new problem here. \"I don\u0027t knowjust what I may have to do by then, but I don\u0027t know of anything now.\"\"Well, how\u0027d you like to come with me, if you\u0027re not too busy. I\u0027ve come to know quite a few girls since I\u0027vebeen here. Nice ones. I can take you out and introduce you to my uncle\u0027s family, if you like. They\u0027re nice people. 　　And afterwards--I know two girls we can go and see--peaches. One of \u0027em did work in the store, but she don\u0027tnow--she\u0027s not doing anything now. The other is her pal. They have a Victrola and they can dance. I know it isn\u0027tthe thing to dance here on Sundays but no one need know anything about that. The girls\u0027 parents don\u0027t mind. 　　Afterwards we might take \u0027em to a movie or something--if you want to--not any of those things down near themill district but one of the better ones--see?\"There formulated itself in Clyde\u0027s mind the question as to what, in regard to just such proposals as this, hiscourse here was to be. In Chicago, and recently--because of what happened in Kansas City--he had sought to beas retiring and cautious as possible. For--after that and while connected with the club, he had been taken withthe fancy of trying to live up to the ideals with which the seemingly stern face of that institution had inspiredhim--conservatism--hard work--saving one\u0027s money--looking neat and gentlemanly. It was such an Evelessparadise, that. 　　In spite of his quiet surroundings here, however, the very air of the city seemed to suggest some such relaxationas this youth was now suggesting--a form of diversion that was probably innocent enough but still connectedwith girls and their entertainment--there were so many of them here, as he could see. These streets, after dinner,here, were so alive with good-looking girls, and young men, too. But what might his new found relatives think ofhim in case he was seen stepping about in the manner and spirit which this youth\u0027s suggestions seemed to imply? 　　Hadn\u0027t he just said that this was an awfully close town and that everybody knew nearly everything abouteverybody else? He paused in doubt. He must decide now. And then, being lonely and hungry forcompanionship, he replied: 　　\"Yes,--well--I think that\u0027s all right.\" But he added a little dubiously: \"Of course my relatives here--\"\"Oh, sure, that\u0027s all right,\" replied Dillard smartly. \"You have to be careful, of course. Well, so do I.\" If he couldonly go around with a Griffiths, even if he was new around here and didn\u0027t know many people--wouldn\u0027t it reflecta lot of credit on him? It most certainly would--did already, as he saw it.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16663.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
