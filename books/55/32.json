{"id":1640,"no":32,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 13","content":"The reasons why a girl of Roberta\u0027s type should be seeking employment with Griffiths and Company at this timeand in this capacity are of some point. For, somewhat after the fashion of Clyde in relation to his family and hislife, she too considered her life a great disappointment. She was the daughter of Titus Alden, a farmer--of nearBiltz, a small town in Mimico County, some fifty miles north. And from her youth up she had seen little butpoverty. Her father--the youngest of three sons of Ephraim Alden, a farmer in this region before him--was sounsuccessful that at forty-eight he was still living in a house which, though old and much in need of repair at thetime his father willed it to him, was now bordering upon a state of dilapidation. The house itself, while primarilya charming example of that excellent taste which produced those delightful gabled homes which embellish theaverage New England town and street, had been by now so reduced for want of paint, shingles, and certain flagswhich had once made a winding walk from a road gate to the front door, that it presented a decidedly melancholyaspect to the world, as though it might be coughing and saying: \"Well, things are none too satisfactory with me.\"The interior of the house corresponded with the exterior. The floor boards and stair boards were loose andcreaked most eerily at times. Some of the windows had shades--some did not. Furniture of both an earlier and alater date, but all in a somewhat decayed condition, intermingled and furnished it in some nondescript mannerwhich need hardly be described.\\n\\n 　　As for the parents of Roberta, they were excellent examples of that native type of Americanism which resistsfacts and reveres illusion. Titus Alden was one of that vast company of individuals who are born, pass through and die out of the world without ever quite getting any one thing straight. They appear, blunder, and end in a fog.\\n\\n 　　Like his two brothers, both older and almost as nebulous, Titus was a farmer solely because his father had been afarmer. And he was here on this farm because it had been willed to him and because it was easier to stay here andtry to work this than it was to go elsewhere. He was a Republican because his father before him was aRepublican and because this county was Republican. It never occurred to him to be otherwise. And, as in thecase of his politics and his religion, he had borrowed all his notions of what was right and wrong from thoseabout him. A single, serious, intelligent or rightly informing book had never been read by any member of thisfamily--not one. But they were nevertheless excellent, as conventions, morals and religions go--honest, upright,God-fearing and respectable.\\n\\n 　　In so far as the daughter of these parents was concerned, and in the face of natural gifts which fitted her forsomething better than this world from which she derived, she was still, in part, at least, a reflection of thereligious and moral notions there and then prevailing,--the views of the local ministers and the laity in general.\\n\\n 　　At the same time, because of a warm, imaginative, sensuous temperament, she was filled--once she reachedfifteen and sixteen--with the world-old dream of all of Eve\u0027s daughters from the homeliest to the fairest--that herbeauty or charm might some day and ere long smite bewitchingly and so irresistibly the soul of a given man ormen.\\n\\n 　　So it was that although throughout her infancy and girlhood she was compelled to hear of and share a deprivingand toilsome poverty, still, because of her innate imagination, she was always thinking of something better.\\n\\n 　　Maybe, some day, who knew, a larger city like Albany or Utica! A newer and greater life.\\n\\n 　　And then what dreams! And in the orchard of a spring day later, between her fourteenth and eighteenth yearswhen the early May sun was making pink lamps of every aged tree and the ground was pinkly carpeted with thefalling and odorous petals, she would stand and breathe and sometimes laugh, or even sigh, her arms upreachedor thrown wide to life. To be alive! To have youth and the world before one. To think of the eyes and the smileof some youth of the region who by the merest chance had passed her and looked, and who might never lookagain, but who, nevertheless, in so doing, had stirred her young soul to dreams.\\n\\n 　　None the less she was shy, and hence recessive--afraid of men, especially the more ordinary types common tothis region. And these in turn, repulsed by her shyness and refinement, tended to recede from her, for all of herphysical charm, which was too delicate for this region. Nevertheless, at the age of sixteen, having repaired toBiltz, in order to work in Appleman\u0027s Dry Goods Store for five dollars a week, she saw many young men whoattracted her. But here because of her mood in regard to her family\u0027s position, as well as the fact that to herinexperienced eyes they appeared so much better placed than herself, she was convinced that they would not beinterested in her. And here again it was her own mood that succeeded in alienating them almost completely.\\n\\n 　　Nevertheless she remained working for Mr. Appleman until she was between eighteen and nineteen, all the whilesensing that she was really doing nothing for herself because she was too closely identified with her home andher family, who appeared to need her.\\n\\n 　　And then about this time, an almost revolutionary thing for this part of the world occurred. For because of thecheapness of labor in such an extremely rural section, a small hosiery plant was built at Trippetts Mills. Andthough Roberta, because of the views and standards that prevailed hereabout, had somehow conceived of thistype of work as beneath her, still she was fascinated by the reports of the high wages to be paid. Accordingly she repaired to Trippetts Mills, where, boarding at the house of a neighbor who had previously lived in Biltz, andreturning home every Saturday afternoon, she planned to bring together the means for some further form ofpractical education--a course at a business college at Homer or Lycurgus or somewhere which might fit her forsomething better--bookkeeping or stenography.\\n\\n 　　And in connection with this dream and this attempted saving two years went by. And in the meanwhile, althoughshe earned more money (eventually twelve dollars a week), still, because various members of her family requiredso many little things and she desired to alleviate to a degree the privations of these others from which shesuffered, nearly all that she earned went to them.\\n\\n 　　And again here, as at Biltz, most of the youths of the town who were better suited to her intellectually andtemperamentally--still looked upon the mere factory type as beneath them in many ways. And although Robertawas far from being that type, still having associated herself with them she was inclined to absorb some of theirpsychology in regard to themselves. Indeed by then she was fairly well satisfied that no one of these here inwhom she was interested would be interested in her--at least not with any legitimate intentions.\\n\\n 　　And then two things occurred which caused her to think, not only seriously of marriage, but of her own future,whether she married or not. For her sister, Agnes, now twenty, and three years her junior, having recentlyreencountered a young schoolmaster who some time before had conducted the district school near the Aldenfarm, and finding him more to her taste now than when she had been in school, had decided to marry him. Andthis meant, as Roberta saw it, that she was about to take on the appearance of a spinster unless she married soon.\\n\\n 　　Yet she did not quite see what was to be done until the hosiery factory at Trippetts Mills suddenly closed, neverto reopen. And then, in order to assist her mother, as well as help with her sister\u0027s wedding, she returned to Biltz.\\n\\n 　　But then there came a third thing which decidedly affected her dreams and plans. Grace Marr, a girl whom shehad met at Trippetts Mills, had gone to Lycurgus and after a few weeks there had managed to connect herselfwith the Finchley Vacuum Cleaner Company at a salary of fifteen dollars a week and at once wrote to Robertatelling her of the opportunities that were then present in Lycurgus. For in passing the Griffiths Company, whichshe did daily, she had seen a large sign posted over the east employment door reading \"Girls Wanted.\" Andinquiry revealed the fact that girls at this company were always started at nine or ten dollars, quickly taught someone of the various phases of piece work and then, once they were proficient, were frequently able to earn asmuch as from fourteen to sixteen dollars, according to their skill. And since board and room were onlyconsuming seven of what she earned, she was delighted to communicate to Roberta, whom she liked very much,that she might come and room with her if she wished.\\n\\n 　　Roberta, having reached the place where she felt that she could no longer endure farm life but must act forherself once more, finally arranged with her mother to leave in order that she might help her more directly withher wages.\\n\\n 　　But once in Lycurgus and employed by Clyde, her life, after the first flush of self-interest which a change sogreat implied for her, was not so much more enlarged socially or materially either, for that matter, over what ithad been in Biltz and Trippetts Mills. For, despite the genial intimacy of Grace Marr--a girl not nearly asattractive as Roberta, and who, because of Roberta\u0027s charm and for the most part affected gayety, counted on herto provide a cheer and companionship which otherwise she would have lacked--still the world into which she was inducted here was scarcely any more liberal or diversified than that from which she sprang.\\n\\n 　　For, to begin with, the Newtons, sister and brother-in-law of Grace Marr, with whom she lived, and who, despitethe fact that they were not unkindly, proved to be, almost more so than were the types with whom, either in Biltzor Trippets Mills, she had been in constant contact, the most ordinary small town mill workers--religious andnarrow to a degree. George Newton, as every one could see and feel, was a pleasant if not very emotional orromantic person who took his various small plans in regard to himself and his future as of the utmost importance.\\n\\n 　　Primarily he was saving what little cash he could out of the wages he earned as threadman in the CranstonWickwire factory to enable him to embark upon some business for which he thought himself fitted. And to thisend, and to further enhance his meager savings, he had joined with his wife in the scheme of taking over an oldhouse in Taylor Street which permitted the renting of enough rooms to carry the rent and in addition to supplythe food for the family and five boarders, counting their labor and worries in the process as nothing. And on theother hand, Grace Marr, as well as Newton\u0027s wife, Mary, were of that type that here as elsewhere find the bulk oftheir social satisfaction in such small matters as relate to the organization of a small home, the establishing of itsimport and integrity in a petty and highly conventional neighborhood and the contemplation of life and conductthrough the lens furnished by a purely sectarian creed.\\n\\n 　　And so, once part and parcel of this particular household, Roberta found after a time, that it, if not Lycurgus, wasnarrow and restricted--not wholly unlike the various narrow and restricted homes at Biltz. And these lines,according to the Newtons and their like, to be strictly observed. No good could come of breaking them. If youwere a factory employee you should accommodate yourself to the world and customs of the better sort ofChristian factory employees. Every day therefore--and that not so very long after she had arrived--she foundherself up and making the best of a not very satisfactory breakfast in the Newton dining room, which was usuallyshared by Grace and two other girls of nearly their own age--Opal Feliss and Olive Pope--who were connectedwith the Cranston Wickwire Company. Also by a young electrician by the name of Fred Shurlock, who workedfor the City Lighting Plant. And immediately after breakfast joining a long procession that day after day at thishour made for the mills across the river. For just outside her own door she invariably met with a company offactory girls and women, boys and men, of the same relative ages, to say nothing of many old and weary-lookingwomen who looked more like wraiths than human beings, who had issued from the various streets and houses ofthis vicinity. And as the crowd, because of the general inpour into it from various streets, thickened at CentralAvenue, there was much ogling of the prettier girls by a certain type of factory man, who, not knowing any ofthem, still sought, as Roberta saw it, unlicensed contacts and even worse. Yet there was much giggling andsimpering on the part of girls of a certain type who were by no means as severe as most of those she had knownelsewhere. Shocking!\\n\\n 　　And at night the same throng, re-forming at the mills, crossing the bridge at the depot and returning as it hadcome. And Roberta, because of her social and moral training and mood, and in spite of her decided looks andcharm and strong desires, feeling alone and neglected. Oh, how sad to see the world so gay and she so lonely.\\n\\n 　　And it was always after six when she reached home. And after dinner there was really nothing much of anythingto do unless she and Grace attended one or another of the moving picture theaters or she could bring herself toconsent to join the Newtons and Grace at a meeting of the Methodist Church.\\n\\n 　　None the less once part and parcel of this household and working for Clyde she was delighted with the change.\\n\\n 　　This big city. This fine Central Avenue with its stores and moving picture theaters. These great mills. And again this Mr. Griffiths, so young, attractive, smiling and interested in her.\\n\\n 象罗伯达这种类型的姑娘，为什么在此时此刻到格里菲思公司厂里来求职(还是小小不言的一个职位)，毕竟是事出有因。原来罗伯达同克莱德的生活际遇和他同家庭的关系多少相似，她也对自己的命数感到大为失望。她是泰特斯。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 奥尔登的女儿。泰特斯是个庄稼汉，住在比尔茨附近。比尔茨是米米科县一个小镇，离莱柯格斯以北大约五十英里。罗伯达自幼时起就净跟贫穷打交道。祖父埃弗雷姆。奥尔登早就在这里务农，她父亲是埃弗雷姆三个儿子里头最小的一个，由于命运多舛，到了四十八岁时，还住在父亲传给他的老宅里。那座老宅，当时已经破旧不堪，急待修缮，到如今差不多快要塌下来了。过去，这种类型的房子曾被看作情趣高雅的典范，从而造出了不少令人喜爱的。有山墙的屋宇，点缀着新英格兰各地城镇和街道。可是如今，这所房子由于油漆剥落，缺少屋顶板和大石板(过去，从大门口直达大楼前门那条曲折的通道，就是用这类大石板砌成)，早已呈现着一片凄凉景象，仿佛一位老人一迭连声在咳嗽，说: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"哦，我的日子可不好过哪。\"屋内陈设跟户外几乎相差无几。天花板。楼梯板都已松散，不时发出吱嘎吱嘎的怪声。窗前有的垂着窗幔，有的就没有。家具既有老式的，也有新式的，全都有几分坏了，混杂在一起，显得乱七八糟，就不用多说了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 罗伯达的父母，就是那种美国精神的典型代表人物，他们否认事实，崇尚理想。泰特斯。奥尔登就是这样芸芸众生中间的一个: \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们从呱呱落地起，一直活到与世长辞，到头来连活着的意义都没有闹明白。他们刚见世面，就误入歧途，最后如坠五里雾中，倏然消失。泰特斯如同那两个跟他差不多糊里糊涂的哥哥一样，他之所以当庄稼汉，就仅仅因为他父亲是个庄稼汉。如今，他之所以守着这个农场，就是因为他父亲把这个农场传给了他，同时，留在这里农场播种耕耘，比上别处去碰运气要容易得多。他入了共和党，因为他的父亲生前就是共和党，而且全县也都是支持共和党的。他脑子里从来没有过与之相反的想法。他的政治和宗教观点，以及一切有关好坏是非的概念，都是从他周围的人那里借来的。这一家子人，从来没有一个人读过一本严肃。富有启发性，或是内容正确的书……简直一个都没有。不过，从传统道德与宗教观点来说，他们毕竟是无与伦比的……诚实。正直。敬畏上帝。品行端正。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 如此一对父母生下的这个女儿，虽然她天生具有凌驾于自己出身阶层之上的素质，可是在她身上少说还部分地反映出当时流行的一些宗教和道德的观念，也反映出本地牧师，乃至于凡夫俗子的思想观点。同时，由于她富于想象力，具有热情似火。性感丰富的气质，当她刚到十五六岁的时候，脑子里就充满了从最丑的到最美的夏娃的女儿们的如同混沌初开时一样古老的梦想，认为: \\n\\n \\n\\n 有朝一日……而且，也许不会多久……她的美貌，或是她的魅力，说不定会以不可抗拒的魔术般的力量征服某一个或则某一些男人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 虽然，在她的幼年时代和少女时代，她不得不听到过并且自己也捱过这种赤贫如洗的生活，可是，她因为天生富于想象力，心里总要想到更美好的日子。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 说不定在哪一天，有谁知道，她会进入一个如同奥尔巴尼，或是尤蒂卡的大城市! \\n\\n \\n\\n 进入一种新的美好的生活。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 随后，有多少美妙的梦想啊! \\n\\n \\n\\n 从十四到十八岁，在暮春时节的果园里，五月初的太阳已使每一棵老树成为一片粉红色，落下来的香喷喷。粉红色的花絮铺满了一地。她伫立在那里，深深地吸了一口气，有时候放声大笑，有时候甚至长叹一声，她那两只胳臂往上伸展，或是敞开胸怀，去拥抱生活。活着多么美好! \\n\\n \\n\\n 她要享受青春，以及展现在她面前的整个世界。她乐意想到住在附近的某个年轻人的眉眼和微笑，因为这个年轻人只是偶尔走过她身过，向她匆匆投以一瞥，说不定从此再也见不到她了，可就是这么匆勿一瞥啊，依然惊扰了她那年轻的心中的梦境。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 不过话又说回来，她非常怕羞，因而常常退避三舍……她害怕男人，尤其是在这里常见的那些平庸。无能之辈。反过来说，这些人一见她高雅。羞涩的神态，也就往往望而却步，虽说她已长得非常婀娜动人，但在这一带地方来说，毕竟还是嫩了一点。不料，她在十六岁那年，来到了比尔茨镇，为了进阿普尔曼绸布店工作，每星期可挣五块美元。她在那里见到过很多她所喜爱的年轻小伙子。不过，因为她觉得自己家庭的社会地位不高，加上自己阅世不深，认为那些年轻人身价似乎都比她高得多，深信他们决不会对她发生兴趣。再说，又是因为她的那种气质，同他们几乎完全疏远了。不过，她照样还是在阿普尔曼先生那里工作，一直到十八。九岁。她总是觉得对自己说真的一点儿帮助都没有，因为她同自己家里过于紧密地连在一起了，看来家里确实急需她的帮助。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 大约就在这时候，发生了对这个世界一隅来说几乎具有革命性质的一件事。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 由于这一带纯属农业区，有着丰富的廉价劳动力，在特里佩茨米尔斯就开设了一家小型针织厂。虽然根据当地一致公认的看法和标准来看，罗伯达也觉得这一类工作仿佛有失自己的身分似的，可是一听说厂里给的工钱多，她还是动心了。于是，她就迁居特里佩茨米尔斯，寄住在原是在比尔茨的邻居家里，每星期六下午回家。她打算积攒一些钱，将来到霍默或是莱柯格斯，或是到有助于她长进的哪一个地方，在商学院选一门课读读……比方说，簿记或是速记。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 为了实现这个梦想和尽可能积攒一些钱，至今已有两个年头了。尽管她挣的钱要比过去多一些(后来每星期挣到十二块美元)，可是，一家老小几乎样样东西都需要添置，她想尽可能减轻他们衣食匮乏的困难(个中况味她自己也尝过啊)，因此，她一人挣来的钱，几乎都涓滴归家了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这里如同比尔茨一样，在小镇上同她志气相投的一些年轻人，十之八九依然认为，厂里这些女工在各方面都不如他们。虽说罗伯达压根儿不是这种类型的女工，不过，她经常跟她们交往，也就不免沾上了她们看待自己的心理。诚然，直到如今，她方才领悟到: \\n\\n \\n\\n 在这里，凡是她喜欢的人，没有一个人会对她感到兴趣……至少还没有表示出一本正经的意思。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 随后又发生两件事，使她不仅要认真考虑结婚问题，而且还得考虑到自己的前途，不管她结婚也好，不结婚也好。她的妹妹艾格尼斯今年二十岁，比她小三岁，不久前跟一个年轻的校长又见面了。此人早先在奥尔登农场附近办过一所区属学校，她妹妹觉得他现在比她在校读书时更为中意，因此决定嫁给他了。罗伯达心里明白，现在她要是还不快一点结婚，恐怕就要被人看成老处女了。不过，她依然不知道该怎么办才好。直到后来，特里佩茨米尔斯的小针织厂突然关闭，永远也不重新开业了。为了帮助她母亲，也为了帮助她妹妹准备婚事，罗伯达就回到了比尔茨。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 不料，后来又发生了第三件事，使她的计划与梦想受到决定性影响。原来她在特里佩茨米尔斯认识的姑娘格雷斯。玛尔到了莱柯格斯，几星期之后，在芬奇利真空吸尘器公司找到了工作，每周薪资十五块美元。玛尔立刻给罗伯达写信，说现在莱柯格斯有可能寻摸到工作。她每天要走过格里菲思公司工厂，有一回看到东头招工部门口挂了一大块招牌，上面写着: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"招雇女工\"，一问才知道: \\n\\n \\n\\n 这家公司女工薪资，开头总是先拿九块或是十块美元，很快就可以学会一门专门技艺，往后只要熟练了，根据她们技术熟练程度，往往可挣到十四块至十六块美元。玛尔的膳宿开支只要七块美元，因此，她非常高兴地通知她的好友罗伯达，巴望她也能来，要是她乐意，不妨就同她合住一个房间。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 事到如今，罗伯达觉得: \\n\\n \\n\\n 农场生活再也受不了，她非得再一次自谋出路不可。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 最后，她终于说服母亲放她走，让她日后靠挣工资更直接地周济她母亲。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 罗伯达一到莱柯格斯，即被克莱德录用，就在这次巨大变化影响之下，尽管她心中体会到一种瞬息即逝的利己主义的乐趣，可是，她很快又感到，她在这里生活，不论在物质方面，还是社交方面，依然如同在比尔茨时一样枯燥乏味。诚然，格雷斯。玛尔对罗伯达打心眼儿里感到很亲热，可是毕竟长得比不上罗伯达那么吸引人。所以，格雷斯。玛尔总是希望这位漂亮和快乐的罗伯达(她的快乐多半是装出来的)能给她的生活里增添一些她本来就很缺少的东西……快乐和友谊。尽管如此，罗伯达刚被引入的这个圈子，并不见得比她的出生地更加丰富多采，或者更加富有自由思想。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 先说跟她同住的牛顿夫妇，他们就是格雷斯。玛尔的姐姐和姐夫。虽说他们待人也很和气，可还是小镇上极其常见的一些工人，有时甚至比她过去在比尔茨，或是特里佩茨米尔斯常见的那类人还要虔信教规，思想更加狭隘。乔治。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 牛顿，一望而知，是个乐乐呵呵的人，虽然不是多情善感或则富有罗曼蒂克情调。各种有关他本人及其前途的小小计划，在他眼里都是无比重要。他是在克兰斯顿厂里工作，如今他正从他挣到的薪资里尽可能积攒下一些钱来，打算将来做自己认为合适的生意。因此，为了使他少得可怜的积蓄能不断增加，他就跟妻子一起设法先将泰勒街上一所老式房子拿过来，然后把好几个房间租出去，以便收取房租，此外还给自己一家人和五个寄宿的人提供膳食……对于自己这样辛辛苦苦地工作，牛顿夫妇从来也都不计较。再说格雷斯。玛尔，如同牛顿太太一样，乃是属于到处都见得到的那类女人，她们的兴趣往往局限于极其狭小框框里，比方说，要是她们能够组织自己的小家庭，要是她们在地位低下，但又极端保守的街坊邻居中间提高了自己威信，要是通过极端狭窄的宗派信念的透镜来审视人间众生相的话，那末，她们也就会感到自己完全心满意足了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 罗伯达寄住在牛顿夫妇家以后，没有多久就觉得: \\n\\n \\n\\n 且不说整个莱柯格斯吧，至少这一家人实在是狭隘。保守得够呛……跟比尔茨那些狭隘。保守的人家差不离。在牛顿夫妇及其同类人看来，这些条条框框必须严格遵守，一破坏了，就不会有好结果。你要是在一个工厂里工作，那你就应该完全适应虔信基督的职工里头上等人那个生活圈子，以及他们的风俗习惯。因此，每天都是一样……她来到了这里没多久早就这样的……她起身以后，便在牛顿家餐室好歹吞下了一顿味儿不怎么样的早餐。跟她一起进餐的，通常有格雷斯，以及两个年龄跟她相仿的姑娘奥帕尔。费利斯和奥利夫。波普……她们两人全都在克兰斯顿公司工作。另外还有一个年轻的电工，名叫弗雷德。舒洛克，是在市内发电厂做工。罗伯达吃过早餐，马上出门，挤进了这个每天此时此刻照例向河对岸的工厂区进发的长长的行列。她刚迈出大门，总会撞见从附近街道左邻右舍涌出来的，跟她年纪相仿的一大群已婚或未婚男女，更不用说许许多多样子疲惫不堪。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 与其说象人还不如说象鬼魂的老妇人了。来自各条街上的人流，都涌向中央大道，所以一汇合到了这里，也就挤挤插插，水泄不通了。在这股人流中经常有一些男工，向漂亮姑娘们目送秋波，他们并不认识她们，但罗伯达看得出，他们还是一心想跟她们无节制地来往，乃至于有更坏的打算。可是，也有一种类型的姑娘，远不是象她在别处见到的姑娘那样严于律己，往往向他们报以傻笑和假笑，使她大吃一惊! \\n\\n \\n\\n 傍晚，还是这股人流，又在各工厂里聚拢来以后，就在车站附近过了桥，返回原地。罗伯达因为有良好道德教养和固有气质，尽管长得品貌端正，富有魅力，而且也有强烈的欲念，她却依然感到很孤单，始终没有引起人们注意。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 啊，你瞧这个世界上是那么快乐，可她却是这么孤寂……该有多难过。她总是在六点过后才回到家。晚饭后，说实在的，一点儿事都没有，除非她跟格雷斯一块上这一家或那一家电影院去，或是她出于无奈，只好答应跟牛顿夫妇和格雷斯一块上美以美会教堂去做礼拜。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 不管怎么说，从她成为牛顿夫妇家的一员，并在克莱德手下干活后，她对自己生活中这一变化还是心满意足的。偌大的一个城市，多美的中央大道，两旁商店林立，还有电影院呢! \\n\\n \\n\\n 这些大工厂! \\n\\n \\n\\n 还有这位格里菲思先生……那么年轻。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 漂亮。笑容满面，而且还对她颇感兴趣呢。 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16669.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
