{"id":1688,"no":80,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 14","content":"Mr. Catchuman did not prove by any means to be the one to extract from Clyde anything more than had eitherMason or Smillie. Although shrewd to a degree in piecing together out of the muddled statements of anothersuch data as seemed most probable, still he was not so successful in the realm of the emotions, as was necessary in the case of Clyde. He was too legal, chilling--unemotional. And in consequence, after grilling Clyde for fourlong hours one hot July afternoon, he was eventually compelled to desist with the feeling that as a plotter ofcrime Clyde was probably the most arresting example of feeble and blundering incapacity he had ever met.\\n\\n 　　For since Smillie\u0027s departure Mason had proceeded to the shores of Big Bittern with Clyde. And there discoveredthe tripod and camera. Also listened to more of Clyde\u0027s lies. And as he now explained to Catchuman that, whileClyde denied owning a camera, nevertheless he had proof that he did own one and had taken it with him when heleft Lycurgus. Yet when confronted with this fact by Catchuman, as the latter now noticed, Clyde had nothing tosay other than that he had not taken a camera with him and that the tripod found was not the one belonging toany camera of his--a lie which so irritated Catchuman that he decided not to argue with him further.\\n\\n 　　At the same time, however, Brookhart having instructed him that, whatever his personal conclusions in regard toClyde, a lawyer of sorts was indispensable--the charity, if not the honor, of the Griffiths being this muchinvolved, the western Griffiths, as Brookhart had already explained to him, having nothing and not being wantedin the case anyhow--he decided that he must find one before leaving. In consequence, and without anyknowledge of the local political situation, he proceeded to the office of Ira Kellogg, president of the CataraquiCounty National Bank, who, although Catchuman did not know it, was high in the councils of the Democraticorganization. And because of his religious and moral views, this same Kellogg was already highly incensed andirritated by the crime of which Clyde was accused. On the other hand, however, because as he well knew thiscase was likely to pave the way for an additional Republican sweep at the approaching primaries, he was notblind to the fact that some reducing opposition to Mason might not be amiss. Fate seemed too obviously to befavoring the Republican machine in the person of and crime committed by Clyde.\\n\\n 　　For since the discovery of this murder, Mason had been basking in such publicity and even nation-wide notorietyas had not befallen any district attorney of this region in years and years. Newspaper correspondents andreporters and illustrators from such distant cities as Buffalo, Rochester, Chicago, New York and Boston, werealready arriving as everybody knew or saw, to either interview or make sketches or take photos of Clyde, Mason,the surviving members of the Alden family, et cetera, while locally Mason was the recipient of undiluted praise,even the Democratic voters in the county joining with the Republicans in assuring each other that Mason was allright, that he was handling this young murderer in the way that he deserved to be handled, and that neither thewealth of the Griffiths nor of the family of that rich girl whom he appeared to have been trying to capture, wasinfluencing this young tribune of the people in the least. He was a real attorney. He had not \"allowed any grass togrow under his feet, you bet.\"Indeed previous to Catchuman\u0027s visit, a coroner\u0027s jury had been called, with Mason attending and directing even,the verdict being that the dead girl had come to her death through a plot devised and executed by one ClydeGriffiths who was then and there in the county jail of Bridgeburg and that he be held to await the verdict of theCounty Grand Jury to whom his crime was soon to be presented. And Mason, through an appeal to the Governor,as all now knew was planning to secure a special sitting of the Supreme Court, which would naturally involve animmediate session of the County Grand Jury in order to hear the evidence and either indict or discharge Clyde.\\n\\n 　　And now, Catchuman arriving to inquire where he was likely to find a local lawyer of real ability who could betrusted to erect some sort of a defense for Clyde. And immediately as an offset to all this there popped intoKellogg\u0027s mind the name and reputation of one Hon. Alvin Belknap, of Belknap and Jephson, of this same city-anindividual who had been twice state senator, three times Democratic assemblyman from this region, and more recently looked upon by various Democratic politicians as one who would be favored with higher honors as soonas it was possible to arrange an issue which would permit the Democrats to enter into local office. In fact, onlythree years before, in a contest with Mason for the district attorneyship, this same Belknap had run closer tovictory than any other candidate on the Democratic ticket. Indeed, so rounded a man was he politically that thisyear he had been slated for that very county judgeship nomination which Mason had in view. And but for thissudden and most amazing development in connection with Clyde, it had been quite generally assumed thatBelknap, once nominated, would be elected. And although Mr. Kellogg did not quite trouble to explain toCatchuman all the complicated details of this very interesting political situation, he did explain that Mr. Belknapwas a very exceptional man, almost the ideal one, if one were looking for an opponent to Mason.\\n\\n 　　And with this slight introduction, Kellogg now offered personally to conduct Catchuman to Belknap andJephson\u0027s office, just across the way in the Bowers Block.\\n\\n 　　And then knocking at Belknap\u0027s door, they were admitted by a brisk, medium-sized and most engaging-lookingman of about forty-eight, whose gray-blue eyes at once fixed themselves in the mind of Catchuman as thepsychic windows of a decidedly shrewd if not altogether masterful and broad-gauge man. For Belknap wasinclined to carry himself with an air which all were inclined to respect. He was a college graduate, and in hisyouth because of his looks, his means, and his local social position (his father had been a judge as well as anational senator from here), he had seen so much of what might be called near-city life that all those gaucheriesas well as sex-inhibitions and sex-longings which still so greatly troubled and motivated and even marked a manlike Mason had long since been covered with an easy manner and social understanding which made him fairlycapable of grasping any reasonable moral or social complication which life was prepared to offer.\\n\\n 　　Indeed he was one who naturally would approach a case such as Clyde\u0027s with less vehemence and fever than didMason. For once, in his twentieth year, he himself had been trapped between two girls, with one of whom he wasmerely playing while being seriously in love with the other. And having seduced the first and being confrontedwith an engagement or flight, he had chosen flight. But not before laying the matter before his father, by whomhe was advised to take a vacation, during which time the services of the family doctor were engaged with theresult that for a thousand dollars and expenses necessary to house the pregnant girl in Utica, the father had finallyextricated his son and made possible his return, and eventual marriage to the other girl.\\n\\n 　　And therefore, while by no means sympathizing with the more cruel and drastic phases of Clyde\u0027s attempt atescape--as so far charged (never in all the years of his law practice had he been able to grasp the psychology of amurderer) still because of the rumored existence and love influence of a rich girl whose name had not as yet beendivulged he was inclined to suspect that Clyde had been emotionally betrayed or bewitched. Was he not poor andvain and ambitious? He had heard so: had even been thinking that he--the local political situation being what itwas might advantageously to himself--and perhaps most disruptingly to the dreams of Mr. Mason be able toconstruct a defense--or at least a series of legal contentions and delays which might make it not so easy for Mr.\\n\\n 　　Mason to walk away with the county judgeship as he imagined. Might it not, by brisk, legal moves now--andeven in the face of this rising public sentiment, or because of it,--be possible to ask for a change of venue--ortime to develop new evidence in which case a trial might not occur before Mr. Mason was out of office. He andhis young and somewhat new associate, Mr. Reuben Jephson, of quite recently the state of Vermont, had beenthinking of it.\\n\\n 　　And now Mr. Catchuman accompanied by Mr. Kellogg. And thereupon a conference with Mr. Catchuman andMr. Kellogg, with the latter arguing quite politically the wisdom of his undertaking such a defense. And his owninterest in the case being what it was, he was not long in deciding, after a conference with his younger associate,that he would. In the long run it could not possibly injure him politically, however the public might feel about itnow.\\n\\n 　　And then Catchuman having handed over a retainer to Belknap as well as a letter introducing him to Clyde,Belknap had Jephson call up Mason to inform him that Belknap \u0026 Jephson, as counsel for Samuel Griffiths onbehalf of his nephew, would require of him a detailed written report of all the charges as well as all the evidencethus far accumulated, the minutes of the autopsy and the report of the coroner\u0027s inquest. Also information as towhether any appeal for a special term of the Supreme Court had as yet been acted upon, and if so what judge hadbeen named to sit, and when and where the Grand Jury would be gathered. Incidentally, he said, Messrs. Belknapand Jephson, having heard that Miss Alden\u0027s body had been sent to her home for burial, would request at once acounsel\u0027s agreement whereby it might be exhumed in order that other doctors now to be called by the defensemight be permitted to examine it--a proposition which Mason at once sought to oppose but finally agreed torather than submit to an order from a Supreme Court judge.\\n\\n 　　These details having been settled, Belknap announced that he was going over to the jail to see Clyde. It was lateand he had had no dinner, and might get none now, but he wanted to have a \"heart to heart\" with this youth,whom Catchuman informed him he would find very difficult. But Belknap, buoyed up as he was by hisopposition to Mason, his conviction that he was in a good mental state to understand Clyde, was in a high degreeof legal curiosity. The romance and drama of this crime! What sort of a girl was this Sondra Finchley, of whomhe had already heard through secret channels? And could she by any chance be brought to Clyde\u0027s defense? Hehad already understood that her name was not to be mentioned--high politics demanding this. He was really mosteager to talk to this sly and ambitious and futile youth.\\n\\n 　　However, on reaching the jail, and after showing Sheriff Slack a letter from Catchuman and asking as a specialfavor to himself that he be taken upstairs to some place near Clyde\u0027s cell in order that, unannounced, he mightfirst observe Clyde, he was quietly led to the second floor and, the outside door leading to the corridor whichfaced Clyde\u0027s cell being opened for him, allowed to enter there alone. And then walking to within a few feet ofClyde\u0027s cell he was able to view him--at the moment lying face down on his iron cot, his arms above his head, atray of untouched food standing in the aperture, his body sprawled and limp. For, since Catchuman\u0027s departure,and his second failure to convince any one of his futile and meaningless lies, he was more despondent than ever.\\n\\n 　　In fact, so low was his condition that he was actually crying, his shoulders heaving above his silent emotion. Atsight of this, and remembering his own youthful escapades, Belknap now felt intensely sorry for him. Nosoulless murderer, as he saw it, would cry.\\n\\n 　　Approaching Clyde\u0027s cell door, after a pause, he began with: \"Come, come, Clyde! This will never do. Youmustn\u0027t give up like this. Your case mayn\u0027t be as hopeless as you think. Wouldn\u0027t you like to sit up and talk to alawyer fellow who thinks he might be able to do something for you? Belknap is my name--Alvin Belknap. I liveright here in Bridgeburg and I have been sent over by that other fellow who was here a while ago--Catchuman,wasn\u0027t that his name? You didn\u0027t get along with him so very well, did you? Well, I didn\u0027t either. He\u0027s not ourkind, I guess. But here\u0027s a letter from him authorizing me to represent you. Want to see it?\" He poked it geniallyand authoritatively through the narrow bars toward which Clyde, now curious and dubious, approached. For there was something so whole-hearted and unusual and seemingly sympathetic and understanding in this man\u0027svoice that Clyde took courage. And without hesitancy, therefore, he took the letter and looked at it, then returnedit with a smile.\\n\\n 　　\"There, I thought so,\" went on Belknap, most convincingly and pleased with his effect, which he creditedentirely to his own magnetism and charm. \"That\u0027s better. I know we\u0027re going to get along. I can feel it. You aregoing to be able to talk to me as easily and truthfully as you would to your mother. And without any fear that anyword of anything you ever tell me is going to reach another ear, unless you want it to, see? For I\u0027m going to beyour lawyer, Clyde, if you\u0027ll let me, and you\u0027re going to be my client, and we\u0027re going to sit down together tomorrow,or whenever you say so, and you\u0027re going to tell me all you think I ought to know, and I\u0027m going to tellyou what I think I ought to know, and whether I\u0027m going to be able to help you. And I\u0027m going to prove to youthat in every way that you help me, you\u0027re helping yourself, see? And I\u0027m going to do my damnedest to get youout of this. Now, how\u0027s that, Clyde?\"He smiled most encouragingly and sympathetically--even affectionately. And Clyde, feeling for the first timesince his arrival here that he had found some one in whom he could possibly confide without danger, was alreadythinking it might be best if he should tell this man all--everything--he could not have said why, quite, but heliked him. In a quick, if dim way he felt that this man understood and might even sympathize with him, if heknew all or nearly all. And after Belknap had detailed how eager this enemy of his--Mason--was to convict him,and how, if he could but devise a reasonable defense, he was sure he could delay the case until this man was outof office, Clyde announced that if he would give him the night to think it all out, to-morrow or any time he choseto come back, he would tell him all.\\n\\n 　　And then, the next day Belknap sitting on a stool and munching chocolate bars, listened while Clyde before himon his iron cot, poured forth his story--all the details of his life since arriving at Lycurgus--how and why he hadcome there, the incident of the slain child in Kansas City, without, however, mention of the clipping which hehimself had preserved and then forgotten; his meeting with Roberta, and his desire for her; her pregnancy andhow he had sought to get her out of it--on and on until, she having threatened to expose him, he had at last, andin great distress and fright, found the item in The Times-union and had sought to emulate that in action. But hehad never plotted it personally, as Belknap was to understand. Nor had he intentionally killed her at the last. No,he had not. Mr. Belknap must believe that, whatever else he thought. He had never deliberately struck her. No,no, no! It had been an accident. There had been a camera, and the tripod reported to have been found by Masonwas unquestionably his tripod. Also, he had hidden it under a log, after accidentally striking Roberta with thecamera and then seeing that sink under the waters, where no doubt it still was, and with pictures of himself andRoberta on the film it contained, if they were not dissolved by the water. But he had not struck her intentionally.\\n\\n 　　No--he had not. She had approached and he had struck, but not intentionally. The boat had upset. And then asnearly as he could, he described how before that he had seemed to be in a trance almost, because having gone sofar he could go no farther.\\n\\n 　　But in the meantime, Belknap, himself finally wearied and confused by this strange story, the impossibility as henow saw it of submitting to, let alone convincing, any ordinary backwoods jury of this region, of the innocenceof these dark and bitter plans and deeds, finally in great weariness and uncertainty and mental confusion, even,getting up and placing his hands on Clyde\u0027s shoulders, saying: \"Well, that\u0027ll be enough of this for to-day, Clyde, Ithink. I see how you felt and how it all came about--also I see how tired you are, and I\u0027m mighty glad you\u0027ve been able to give me the straight of this, because I know how hard it\u0027s been for you to do it. But I don\u0027t want youto talk any more now. There are going to be other days, and I have a few things I want to attend to before I takeup some of the minor phases of this with you to-morrow or next day. Just you sleep and rest for the present.\\n\\n 　　You\u0027ll need all you can get for the work both of us will have to do a little later. But just now, you\u0027re not to worry,because there\u0027s no need of it, do you see? I\u0027ll get you out of this--or we will--my partner and I. I have a partnerthat I\u0027m going to bring around here presently. You\u0027ll like him, too. But there are one or two things that I want youto think about and stick to--and one of these is that you\u0027re not to let anybody frighten you into anything, becauseeither myself or my partner will be around here once a day anyhow, and anything you have to say or want toknow you can say or find out from us. Next you\u0027re not to talk to anybody--Mason, the sheriff, these jailers, noone--unless I tell you to. No one, do you hear! And above all things, don\u0027t cry any more. For if you are asinnocent as an angel, or as black as the devil himself, the worst thing you can do is to cry before any one. Thepublic and these jail officers don\u0027t understand that--they invariably look upon it as weakness or a confession ofguilt. And I don\u0027t want them to feel any such thing about you now, and especially when I know that you\u0027re reallynot guilty. I know that now. I believe it. See! So keep a stiff upper lip before Mason and everybody.\\n\\n 　　\"In fact, from now on I want you to try and laugh a little--or at any rate, smile and pass the time of day with thesefellows around here. There\u0027s an old saying in law, you know, that the consciousness of innocence makes any mancalm. Think and look innocent. Don\u0027t sit and brood and look as though you had lost your last friend, because youhaven\u0027t. I\u0027m here, and so is my partner, Mr. Jephson. I\u0027ll bring him around here in a day or two, and you\u0027re to lookand act toward him exactly as you have toward me. Trust him, because in legal matters he\u0027s even smarter than Iam in some ways. And to-morrow I\u0027m going to bring you a couple of books and some magazines and papers,and I want you to read them or look at the pictures. They\u0027ll help keep your mind off your troubles.\"Clyde achieved a rather feeble smile and nodded his head.\\n\\n 　　\"From now on, too,--I don\u0027t know whether you\u0027re at all religious--but whether you are or not, they hold serviceshere in the jail on Sundays, and I want you to attend \u0027em regularly--that is, if they ask you to. For this is areligious community and I want you to make as good an impression as you can. Never mind what people say orhow they look--you do as I tell you. And if this fellow Mason or any of those fellows around here get topestering you any more, send me a note.\\n\\n 　　\"And now I\u0027ll be going, so give me a cheerful smile as I go out--and another one as I come in. And don\u0027t talk,see?\"Then shaking Clyde briskly by the shoulders and slapping him on the back, he strode out, actually thinking tohimself: \"But do I really believe that this fellow is as innocent as he says? Would it be possible for a fellow tostrike a girl like that and not know that he was doing it intentionally? And then swimming away afterwards,because, as he says, if he went near her he thought he might drown too. Bad. Bad! What twelve men are going tobelieve that? And that bag, those two hats, that missing suit! And yet he swears he didn\u0027t intentionally strike her.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16832.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
