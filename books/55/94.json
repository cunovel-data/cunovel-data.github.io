{"id":1702,"no":94,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 28","content":"Bridgeburg and a slow train that set down a tired, distrait woman at its depot after midnight on the eighth ofDecember. Bitter cold and bright stars. A lone depot assistant who on inquiry directed her to the BridgeburgCentral House--straight up the street which now faced her, then two blocks to her left after she reached thesecond street. The sleepy night clerk of the Central House providing her instantly with a room and, once he knewwho she was, directing her to the county jail. But she deciding after due rumination that now was not the hour. 　　He might be sleeping. She would go to bed and rise early in the morning. She had sent him various telegrams. Heknew that she was coming. 　　But as early as seven in the morning, rising, and by eight appearing at the jail, letters, telegrams and credentialsin hand. And the jail officials, after examining the letters she carried and being convinced of her identity,notifying Clyde of her presence. And he, depressed and forlorn, on hearing this news, welcoming the thought ofher as much as at first he had dreaded her coming. For now things were different. All the long grim story hadbeen told. And because of the plausible explanation which Jephson had provided him, he could face her perhapsand say without a quaver that it was true--that he had not plotted to kill Roberta--that he had not willingly left herto die in the water. And then hurrying down to the visitor\u0027s room, where, by the courtesy of Slack, he waspermitted to talk with his mother alone. 　　On seeing her rise at his entrance, and hurrying to her, his troubled intricate soul not a little dubious, yetconfident also that it was to find sanctuary, sympathy, help, perhaps--and that without criticism--in her heart. 　　And exclaiming with difficulty, as a lump thickened in his throat: \"Gee, Ma! I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve come.\" But she toomoved for words--her condemned boy in her arms--merely drawing his head to her shoulder and then lookingup. The Lord God had vouchsafed her this much. Why not more? The ultimate freedom of her son--or if not that,at least a new trial--a fair consideration of the evidence in his favor which had not been had yet, of course. Andso they stood for several moments. 　　Then news of home, the reason for her presence, her duty as a correspondent to interview him--later to appearwith him in court at the hour of his sentence--a situation over which Clyde winced. Yet now, as he heard fromher, his future was likely to depend on her efforts alone. The Lycurgus Griffiths, for reasons of their own, haddecided not to aid him further. But she--if she were but able to face the world with a sound claim--might still aidhim. Had not the Lord aided her thus far? Yet to face the world and the Lord with her just one plea she mustknow from him--now--the truth as to whether he had intentionally or unintentionally struck Roberta--whetherintentionally or unintentionally he had left her to die. She had read the evidence and his letters and had noted allthe defects in his testimony. But were those things as contended by Mason true or false? 　　Clyde, now as always overawed and thrown back on himself by that uncompromising and shameless honestywhich he had never been able quite to comprehend in her, announced, with all the firmness that he couldmuster--yet with a secret quavering chill in his heart--that he had sworn to the truth. He had not done thosethings with which he had been charged. He had not. But, alas, as she now said to herself, on observing him, whatwas that about his eyes--a faint flicker perhaps. He was not so sure--as self-convinced and definite as she hadhoped--as she had prayed he would be. No, no, there was something in his manner, his words, as he spoke--afaint recessive intonation, a sense of something troubled, dubious, perhaps, which quite froze her now. 　　He was not positive enough. And so he might have plotted, in part at least, as she had feared at first, when shehad first heard of this--might have even struck her on that lone, secret lake!--who could tell? (the searing,destroying power of such a thought as that). And that in the face of all his testimony to the contrary. 　　But \"Jehovah, jirah, Thou wilt not require of a mother, in her own and her son\u0027s darkest hour, that she doubthim,--make sure his death through her own lack of faith? Oh, no--Thou wilt not. O Lamb of God, Thou wilt not!\"She turned; she bruised under her heel the scaly head of this dark suspicion--as terrifying to her as his guilt wasto him. \"O Absalom, my Absalom!\" Come, come, we will not entertain such a thought. God himself would noturge it upon a mother. Was he not here--her son--before her, declaring firmly that he had not done this thing. Shemust believe--she would believe him utterly. She would--and did--whatever fiend of doubt might still remainlocked in the lowest dungeon of her miserable heart. Come, come, the public should know how she felt. She andher son would find a way. He must believe and pray. Did he have a Bible? Did he read it? And Clyde havingbeen long since provided with a Bible by a prison worker, assured her that he had and did read it. 　　But now she must go first to see his lawyers, next to file her dispatch, after which she would return. But once outon the street being immediately set upon by several reporters and eagerly questioned as to the meaning of herpresence here. Did she believe in her son\u0027s innocence? Did she or did she not think that he had had a fair trial? 　　Why had she not come on before? And Mrs. Griffiths, in her direct and earnest and motherly way, taking theminto her confidence and telling how as well as why she came to be here, also why she had not come before. 　　But now that she was here she hoped to stay. The Lord would provide the means for the salvation of her son, ofwhose innocence she was convinced. Would they not ask God to help her? Would they not pray for her success? 　　And with the several reporters not a little moved and impressed, assuring her that they would, of course, andthereafter describing her to the world at large as she was--middle-aged, homely, religious, determined, sincereand earnest and with a moving faith in the innocence of her boy. 　　But the Griffiths of Lycurgus, on hearing this, resenting her coming as one more blow. And Clyde, in his cell, onreading of it later, somewhat shocked by the gross publicity now attending everything in connection with him,yet, because of his mother\u0027s presence, resigned and after a time almost happy. Whatever her faults or defects,after all she was his mother, wasn\u0027t she? And she had come to his aid. Let the public think what it would. Was henot in the shadow of death and she at least had not deserted him. And with this, her suddenly manifested skill inconnecting herself in this way with a Denver paper, to praise her for. 　　She had never done anything like this before. And who knew but that possibly, and even in the face of her direpoverty now, she might still be able to solve this matter of a new trial for him and to save his life? Who knew? 　　And yet how much and how indifferently he had sinned against her! Oh, how much. And still here she was--his mother still anxious and tortured and yet loving and seeking to save his life by writing up his own conviction fora western paper. No longer did the shabby coat and the outlandish hat and the broad, immobile face andsomewhat stolid and crude gestures seem the racking and disturbing things they had so little time since. She washis mother and she loved him, and believed in him and was struggling to save him. 　　On the other hand Belknap and Jephson on first encountering her were by no means so much impressed. Forsome reason they had not anticipated so crude and unlettered and yet convinced a figure. The wide, flat shoes. 　　The queer hat. The old brown coat. Yet somehow, after a few moments, arrested by her earnestness and faith andlove for her son and her fixed, inquiring, and humanly clean and pure blue eyes in which dwelt immaterialconviction and sacrifice with no shadow of turning. 　　Did they personally think her son innocent? She must know that first. Or did they secretly believe that he wasguilty? She had been so tortured by all the contradictory evidence. God had laid a heavy cross upon her and hers. 　　Nevertheless, Blessed be His name! And both, seeing and feeling her great concern, were quick to assure her thatthey were convinced of Clyde\u0027s innocence. If he were executed for this alleged crime it would be a travesty onjustice. 　　Yet both, now that they saw her, troubled as to the source of any further funds, her method of getting here, whichshe now explained, indicating that she had nothing. And an appeal sure to cost not less than two thousand. AndMrs. Griffiths, after an hour in their presence, in which they made clear to her the basic cost of an appeal-coveringbriefs to be prepared, arguments, trips to be made--asserting repeatedly that she did not quite see howshe was to do. Then suddenly, and to them somewhat inconsequentially, yet movingly and dramatically,exclaiming: \"The Lord will not desert me. I know it. He has declared himself unto me. It was His voice there inDenver that directed me to that paper. And now that I am here, I will trust Him and He will guide me.\"But Belknap and Jephson merely looking at one another in unconvinced and pagan astonishment. Such faith! Anexhorter! An Evangelist, no less! Yet to Jephson, here was an idea! There was the religious element to bereckoned with everywhere--strong in its agreement with just such faith. Assuming the Griffiths of Lycurgus toremain obdurate and unmoved--why then--why then--and now that she was here--there were the churches and thereligious people generally. Might it not be possible, with such a temperament and such faith as this, to appeal tothe very element that had hitherto most condemned Clyde and made his conviction a certainty, for fundswherewith to carry this case to the court of appeals? This lorn mother. Her faith in her boy. 　　Presto! 　　A lecture, at so much for admission, and in which, hard-pressed as she was and could show, she would set forththe righteousness of her boy\u0027s claim--seek to obtain the sympathy of the prejudiced public and incidentally twothousand dollars or more with which this appeal could be conducted. 　　And now Jephson, turning to her and laying the matter before her and offering to prepare a lecture or notes--acondensation of his various arguments--in fact, an entire lecture which she could re-arrange and present as shechose--all the data which was the ultimate, basic truth in regard to her son. And she, her brown cheeks flushingand her eyes brightening, agreeing she would do it. She would try. She could do no less than try. Verily, verily,was not this the Voice and Hand of God in the darkest hour of her tribulation? 　　On the following morning Clyde was arraigned for sentence, with Mrs. Griffiths given a seat near him andseeking, paper and pencil in hand, to make notes of, for her, an unutterable scene, while a large crowd surveyedher. His own mother! And acting as a reporter! Something absurd, grotesque, insensitive, even ludicrous, aboutsuch a family and such a scene. And to think the Griffiths of Lycurgus should be so immediately related to them. 　　Yet Clyde sustained and heartened by her presence. For had she not returned to the jail the previous afternoonwith her plan? And as soon as this was over--whatever the sentence might be--she would begin with her work. 　　And so, and that almost in spite of himself, in his darkest hour, standing up before Justice Oberwaltzer andlistening first to a brief recital of his charge and trial (which was pronounced by Oberwaltzer to have been fairand impartial), then to the customary: \"Have you any cause which shows why the judgment of death should notnow be pronounced against you according to law?\"--to which and to the astonishment of his mother and theauditors (if not Jephson, who had advised and urged him so to do), Clyde now in a clear and firm voice replied: 　　\"I am innocent of the crime as charged in the indictment. I never killed Roberta Alden and therefore I think thissentence should not be passed.\"And then staring straight before him conscious only of the look of admiration and love turned on him by hismother. For had not her son now declared himself, here at this fatal moment, before all these people? And hisword here, if not in that jail, would be true, would it not? Then her son was not guilty. He was not. He was not. 　　Praised be the name of the Lord in the highest. And deciding to make a great point of this in her dispatch--so asto get it in all the papers, and in her lecture afterwards. 　　However, Oberwaltzer, without the faintest sign of surprise or perturbation, now continued: \"Is there anythingelse you care to say?\"\"No,\" replied Clyde, after a moment\u0027s hesitation. 　　\"Clyde Griffiths,\" then concluded Oberwaltzer, \"the judgment of the Court is that you, Clyde Griffiths, for themurder in the first degree of one, Roberta Alden, whereof you are convicted, be, and you are hereby sentenced tothe punishment of death; and it is ordered that, within ten days after this day\u0027s session of Court, the Sheriff of thiscounty of Cataraqui deliver you, together with the warrant of this Court, to the Agent and Warden of the StatePrison of the State of New York at Auburn, where you shall be kept in solitary confinement until the weekbeginning Monday the 28th day of January, 19--, and, upon some day within the week so appointed, the saidAgent and Warden of the State Prison of the State of New York at Auburn is commended to do execution uponyou, Clyde Griffiths, in the mode and manner prescribed by the laws of the State of New York.\"And that done, a smile from Mrs. Griffiths to her boy and an answering smile from Clyde to her. For since hehad announced that he was not guilty--HERE--her spirit had risen in the face of this sentence. He was reallyinnocent,--he must be, since he had declared it here. And Clyde because of her smile saying to himself, hismother believed in him now. She had not been swayed by all the evidence against him. And this faith, mistaken or not, was now so sustaining--so needed. What he had just said was true as he now saw it. He had not struckRoberta. That WAS true. And therefore he was not guilty. Yet Kraut and Slack were once more seizing him andescorting him to the cell. 　　Immediately thereafter his mother seating herself at a press table proceeded to explain to contiguous pressrepresentatives now curiously gathering about her: \"You mustn\u0027t think too badly of me, you gentlemen of thepapers. I don\u0027t know much about this but it is the only way I could think of to be with my boy. I couldn\u0027t havecome otherwise.\" And then one lanky correspondent stepping up to say: \"Don\u0027t worry, mother. Is there any way Ican help you? Want me to straighten out what you want to say? I\u0027ll be glad to.\" And then sitting down beside herand proceeding to help her arrange her impressions in the form in which he assumed her Denver paper might likethem. And others as well offering to do anything they could--and all greatly moved. 　　Two days later, the proper commitment papers having been prepared and his mother notified of the change butnot permitted to accompany him, Clyde was removed to Auburn, the Western penitentiary of the State of NewYork, where in the \"death house\" or \"Murderers\u0027 Row,\" as it was called--as gloomy and torturesome an infernoas one could imagine any human compelled to endure--a combination of some twenty-two cells on two separatelevels--he was to be restrained until ordered retried or executed. 　　Yet as he traveled from Bridgeburg to this place, impressive crowds at every station--young and old--men,women and children--all seeking a glimpse of the astonishingly youthly slayer. And girls and women, under theguise of kindly interest, but which, at best, spelled little more than a desire to achieve a facile intimacy with thisdaring and romantic, if unfortunate figure, throwing him a flower here and there and calling to him gayly andloudly as the train moved out from one station or another: 　　\"Hello, Clyde! Hope to see you soon again. Don\u0027t stay too long down there.\" \"If you take an appeal, you\u0027re sureto be acquitted. We hope so, anyhow.\"And with Clyde not a little astonished and later even heartened by this seemingly favorable discrepancy betweenthe attitude of the crowds in Bridgeburg and this sudden, morbid, feverish and even hectic curiosity here, bowingand smiling and even waving with his hand. Yet thinking, none the less, \"I am on the way to the death house andthey can be so friendly. It is a wonder they dare.\" And with Kraut and Sissel, his guards, because of thedistinction and notoriety of being both his captors and jailors, as well also because of these unusual attentionsfrom passengers on the train and individuals in these throngs without being themselves flattered and ennobled. 　　But after this one brief colorful flight in the open since his arrest, past these waiting throngs and over wintersunlit fields and hills of snow that reminded him of Lycurgus, Sondra, Roberta, and all that he had sokaleidoscopically and fatally known in the twenty months just past, the gray and restraining walls of Auburnitself--with, once he was presented to a clerk in the warden\u0027s office and his name and crime entered in thebooks--himself assigned to two assistants, who saw to it that he was given a prison bath and hair cut--all thewavy, black hair he so much admired cut away--a prison-striped uniform and hideous cap of the same material,prison underwear and heavy gray felt shoes to quiet the restless prison tread in which in time he might indulge,together with the number, 77221. 　　And so accoutered, immediately transferred to the death house proper, where in a cell on the ground floor he was now locked--a squarish light clean space, eight by ten feet in size and fitted with sanitary plumbing as well as acot bed, a table, a chair and a small rack for books. And here then, while he barely sensed that there were othercells about him--ranging up and down a wide hall--he first stood--and then seated himself--now no longerbuoyed by the more intimate and sociable life of the jail at Bridgeburg--or those strange throngs and scenes thathad punctuated his trip here. 　　The hectic tensity and misery of these hours! That sentence to die; that trip with all those people calling to him;that cutting of his hair downstairs in that prison barber shop--and by a convict; the suit and underwear that wasnow his and that he now had on. There was no mirror here--or anywhere,--but no matter--he could feel how helooked. This baggy coat and trousers and this striped cap. He threw it hopelessly to the floor. For but an hourbefore he had been clothed in a decent suit and shirt and tie and shoes, and his appearance had been neat andpleasing as he himself had thought as he left Bridgeburg. But now--how must he look? And to-morrow hismother would be coming--and later Jephson or Belknap, maybe. God! 　　But worse--there, in that cell directly opposite him, a sallow and emaciated and sinister-looking Chinaman in asuit exactly like his own, who had come to the bars of his door and was looking at him out of inscrutable slanteyes, but as immediately turning and scratching himself--vermin, maybe, as Clyde immediately feared. Therehad been bedbugs at Bridgeburg. 　　A Chinese murderer. For was not this the death house? But as good as himself here. And with a garb like hisown. Thank God visitors were probably not many. He had heard from his mother that scarcely any wereallowed--that only she and Belknap and Jephson and any minister he chose might come once a week. But nowthese hard, white-painted walls brightly lighted by wide unobstructed skylights by day and as he could see--byincandescent lamps in the hall without at night--yet all so different from Bridgeburg,--so much more bright orharsh illuminatively. For there, the jail being old, the walls were a gray-brown, and not very clean--the cellslarger, the furnishings more numerous--a table with a cloth on it at times, books, papers, a chess-and checkerboard--whereas here--here was nothing, these hard narrow walls--the iron bars rising to a heavy solid ceilingabove--and that very, very heavy iron door which yet--like the one at Bridgeburg, had a small hole throughwhich food would be passed, of course. 　　But just then a voice from somewhere: 　　\"Hey! we got a new one wid us, fellers! Ground tier, second cell, east.\" And then a second voice: \"You don\u0027t say. 　　Wot\u0027s he like?\" And a third: \"Wot\u0027s yer name, new man? Don\u0027t be scared. You ain\u0027t no worse off than the rest ofus.\" And then the first voice, answering number two: \"Kinda tall and skinny. A kid. Looks a little like mamma\u0027sboy, but not bad at dat. Hey, you! Tell us your name!\"And Clyde, amazed and dumb and pondering. For how was one to take such an introduction as this? What tosay--what to do? Should he be friendly with these men? Yet, his instinct for tact prompting him even here toreply, most courteously and promptly: \"Clyde Griffiths.\" And one of the first voices continuing: \"Oh, sure! Weknow who you are. Welcome, Griffiths. We ain\u0027t as bad as we sound. We been readin\u0027 a lot about you, up dere inBridgeburg. We thought you\u0027d be along pretty soon now.\" And another voice: \"You don\u0027t want to be too down. Itain\u0027t so worse here. At least de place is all right--a roof over your head, as dey say.\" And then a laugh fromsomewhere. 　　But Clyde, too horrified and sickened for words, was sadly gazing at the walls and door, then over at theChinaman, who, silent at his door, was once more gazing at him. Horrible! Horrible! And they talked to eachother like that, and to a stranger among them so familiarly. No thought for his wretchedness, his strangeness, histimidity--the horror he must be suffering. But why should a murderer seem timid to any one, perhaps, ormiserable? Worst of all they had been speculating HERE as to how long it would be before he would be alongwhich meant that everything concerning him was known here. Would they nag--or bully--or make trouble forone unless one did just as they wished? If Sondra, or any one of all the people he had known, should see or evendream of him as he was here now . . . God!--And his own mother was coming to-morrow. 　　And then an hour later, now evening, a tall, cadaverous guard in a more pleasing uniform, putting an iron traywith food on it through that hole in the door. Food! And for him here. And that sallow, rickety Chinaman overthe way taking his. Whom had he murdered? How? And then the savage scraping of iron trays in the variouscells! Sounds that reminded him more of hungry animals being fed than men. And some of these men wereactually talking as they ate and scraped. It sickened him. 　　\"Gee! It\u0027s a wonder them guys in the mush gallery couldn\u0027t think of somepin else besides cold beans and friedpotatoes and coffee.\"\"The coffee tonight . . . oh, boy! . . . Now in the jail at Buffalo--though . . .\"\"Oh, cut it out,\" came from another corner. \"We\u0027ve heard enough about the jail at Buffalo and your swell chow. 　　You don\u0027t show any afternoon tea appetite around here, I notice.\"\"Just the same,\" continued the first voice, \"as I look back on\u0027t now, it musta been pretty good. Dat\u0027s a way itseems, anyhow, now.\"\"Oh, Rafferty, do let up,\" called still another. 　　And then, presumably \"Rafferty\" once more, who said: \"Now, I\u0027ll just take a little siesta after dis--and den I\u0027ll callme chauffeur and go for a little spin. De air to-night must be fine.\"Then from still another hoarse voice: \"Oh, you with your sick imagination. Say, I\u0027d give me life for a smoker. 　　And den a good game of cards.\"\"Do they play cards here?\" thought Clyde. 　　\"I suppose since Rosenstein was defeated for mayor here he won\u0027t play.\"\"Won\u0027t he, though?\" This presumably from Rosenstein. 　　To Clyde\u0027s left, in the cell next to him, a voice, to a passing guard, low and yet distinctly audible: \"Psst! Anyword from Albany yet?\"\"No word, Herman.\"\"And no letter, I suppose.\"\"No letter.\"The voice was very strained, very tense, very miserable, and after this, silence. 　　A moment later, from another cell farther off, a voice from the lowest hell to which a soul can descend--completeand unutterable despair--\"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\"And then from the tier above another voice: \"Oh, Jesus! Is that farmer going to begin again? I can\u0027t stand it. 　　Guard! Guard! Can\u0027t you get some dope for that guy?\"Once more the voice from the lowest: \"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\"Clyde was up, his fingers clinched. His nerves were as taut as cords about to snap. A murderer! And about to die,perhaps. Or grieving over some terrible thing like his own fate. Moaning--as he in spirit at least had so oftenmoaned there in Bridgeburg. Crying like that! God! And there must be others! 　　And day after day and night after night more of this, no doubt, until, maybe--who could tell--unless. But, oh, no! 　　Oh, no! Not himself--not that--not his day. Oh, no. A whole year must elapse before that could possibly happen-orso Jephson had said. Maybe two. But, at that--! . . . in two years!!! He found himself stricken with an aguebecause of the thought that even in so brief a time as two years. . . . 　　That other room! It was in here somewhere too. This room was connected with it. He knew that. There was adoor. It led to that chair. THAT CHAIR.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16846.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
