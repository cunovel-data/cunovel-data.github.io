{"id":1670,"no":62,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 43","content":"Yet a thought such as that of the lake, connected as it was with the predicament by which he was being faced,and shrink from it though he might, was not to be dismissed as easily as he desired. Born as it was of itsaccidental relation to this personal problem that was shaking and troubling and all but disarranging his ownnone-too-forceful mind, this smooth, seemingly blameless, if dreadful, blotting out of two lives at Pass Lake, hadits weight. That girl\u0027s body--as some peculiar force in his own brain now still compelled him to think--beingfound, but the man\u0027s not. In that interesting fact--and this quite in spite of himself--lurked a suggestion thatinsisted upon obtruding itself on his mind--to wit, that it might be possible that the man\u0027s body was not in thatlake at all. For, since evil-minded people did occasionally desire to get rid of other people, might it not bepossible that that man had gone there with that girl in order to get rid of her? A very smooth and devilish trick, ofcourse, but one which, in this instance at least, seemed to have succeeded admirably. 　　But as for him accepting such an evil suggestion and acting upon it . . . never! Yet here was his own problemgrowing hourly more desperate, since every day, or at least every other day, brought him either letters fromRoberta or a note from Sondra--their respective missives maintaining the same relative contrast between ease andmisery, gayety of mood and the somberness of defeat and uncertainty. 　　To Roberta, since he would not write her, he was telephoning briefly and in as non-committal a manner aspossible. How was she? He was so glad to hear from her and to know that she was out in the country and athome, where it must be much nicer than in the factory here in this weather. Everything was going smoothly, ofcourse, and except for a sudden rush of orders which made it rather hard these last two days, all was as before. 　　He was doing his best to save a certain amount of money for a certain project about which she knew, butotherwise he was not worrying about anything--and she must not. He had not written before because of the work,and could not write much--there were so many things to do--but he missed seeing her in her old place, and waslooking forward to seeing her again soon. If she were coming down toward Lycurgus as she said, and reallythought it important to see him, well, that could be arranged, maybe--but was it necessary right now? He was sovery busy and expected to see her later, of course. 　　But at the same time he was writing Sondra that assuredly on the eighteenth, and the week-end following, ifpossible, he would be with her. 　　So, by virtue of such mental prestidigitation and tergiversation, inspired and animated as it was by his desire forSondra, his inability to face the facts in connection with Roberta, he achieved the much-coveted privilege ofagain seeing her, over one week-end at least, and in such a setting as never before in his life had he beenprivileged to witness. 　　For as he came down to the public dock at Sharon, adjoining the veranda of the inn at the foot of Twelfth Lake,he was met by Bertine and her brother as well as Sondra, who, in Grant\u0027s launch, had motored down the Chain topick him up. The bright blue waters of the Indian Chain. The tall, dark, spear pines that sentineled the shores oneither side and gave to the waters at the west a band of black shadow where the trees were mirrored so clearly. 　　The small and large, white and pink and green and brown lodges on every hand, with their boathouses. Pavilionsby the shore. An occasional slender pier reaching out from some spacious and at times stately summer lodge,such as those now owned by the Cranstons, Finchleys and others. The green and blue canoes and launches. Thegay hotel and pavilion at Pine Point already smartly attended by the early arrivals here! And then the pier andboathouse of the Cranston Lodge itself, with two Russian wolfhounds recently acquired by Bertine lying on thegrass near the shore, apparently awaiting her return, and a servant John, one of a half dozen who attended thefamily here, waiting to take the single bag of Clyde, his tennis racquet and golf sticks. But most of all he wasimpressed by the large rambling and yet smartly-designed house, with its bright geranium-bordered walks, itswide, brown, wicker-studded veranda commanding a beautiful view of the lake; the cars and personalities of thevarious guests, who in golf, tennis or lounging clothes were to be seen idling here and there. 　　At Bertine\u0027s request, John at once showed him to a spacious room overlooking the lake, where it was hisprivilege now to bathe and change for tennis with Sondra, Bertine and Grant. After dinner, as explained bySondra, who was over at Bertine\u0027s for the occasion, he was to come over with Bertine and Grant to the Casino,where he would be introduced to such as all here knew. There was to be dancing. To-morrow, in the morningearly, before breakfast, if he chose--he should ride with her and Bertine and Stuart along a wonderful woodlandtrail through the forests to the west which led to Inspiration Point and a more distant view of the lake. And, as henow learned, except for a few such paths as this, the forest was trackless for forty miles. Without a compass orguide, as he was told, one might wander to one\u0027s death even--so evasive were directions to those who did notknow. And after breakfast and a swim she and Bertine and Nina Temple would demonstrate their new skill withSondra\u0027s aquaplane. After that, lunch, tennis, or golf, a trip to the Casino for tea. After dinner at the lodge of theBrookshaws of Utica across the lake, there was to be dancing. 　　Within an hour after his arrival, as Clyde could see, the program for the week-end was already full. But that heand Sondra would contrive not only moments but possibly hours together he well knew. And then he would seewhat new delight, in connection with her many-faceted temperament, the wonderful occasion would provide. Tohim, in spite of the dour burden of Roberta, which for this one week-end at least he could lay aside, it was asthough he were in Paradise. 　　And on the tennis grounds of the Cranstons, it seemed as though never before had Sondra, attired in a short,severe white tennis skirt and blouse, with a yellow-and-green dotted handkerchief tied about her hair, seemed sogay, graceful and happy. The smile that was upon her lips! The gay, laughing light of promise that was in her eyes whenever she glanced at him! And now and then, in running to serve him, it was as though she were poisedbird-like in flight--her racquet arm high, a single toe seeming barely to touch the ground, her head thrown back,her lips parted and smiling always. And in calling twenty love, thirty love, forty love, it was always with alaughing accent on the word love, which at once thrilled and saddened him, as he saw, and rejoiced in from onepoint of view, she was his to take, if only he were free to take her now. But this other black barrier which hehimself had built! 　　And then this scene, where a bright sun poured a flood of crystal light upon a greensward that stretched from tallpines to the silver rippling waters of a lake. And off shore in a half dozen different directions the bright whitesails of small boats--the white and green and yellow splashes of color, where canoes paddled by idling loverswere passing in the sun! Summertime--leisure--warmth--color--ease--beauty--love--all that he had dreamed ofthe summer before, when he was so very much alone. 　　At moments it seemed to Clyde that he would reel from very joy of the certain fulfillment of a great desire, thatwas all but immediately within his control; at other times (the thought of Roberta sweeping down upon him as anicy wind), as though nothing could be more sad, terrible, numbing to the dreams of beauty, love and happinessthan this which now threatened him. That terrible item about the lake and those two people drowned! Theprobability that in spite of his wild plan within a week, or two or three at most, he would have to leave all thisforever. And then of a sudden he would wake to realize that he was fumbling or playing badly--that Bertine orSondra or Grant was calling: \"Oh, Clyde, what are you thinking of, anyhow?\" And from the darkest depths of hisheart he would have answered, had he spoken, \"Roberta.\"At the Brookshaws\u0027, again that evening, a smart company of friends of Sondra\u0027s, Bertine\u0027s and others. On thedance floor a reencounter with Sondra, all smiles, for she was pretending for the benefit of others here--hermother and father in particular--that she had not seen Clyde before--did not even know that he was here. 　　\"You up here? That\u0027s great. Over at the Cranstons\u0027? Oh, isn\u0027t that dandy? Right next door to us. Well, we\u0027ll see alot of each other, what? How about a canter to-morrow before seven? Bertine and I go nearly every day. Andwe\u0027ll have a picnic tomorrow, if nothing interferes, canoeing and motoring. Don\u0027t worry about not riding well. I\u0027llget Bertine to let you have Jerry--he\u0027s just a sheep. And you don\u0027t need to worry about togs, either. Grant hasscads of things. I\u0027ll dance the next two dances with others, but you sit out the third one with me, will you? I knowa peach of a place outside on the balcony.\"She was off with fingers extended but with a \"we-understand-each-other\" look in her eye. And outside in theshadow later she pulled his face to hers when no one was looking and kissed him eagerly, and, before theevening was over, they had managed, by strolling along a path which led away from the house along the lakeshore, to embrace under the moon. 　　\"Sondra so glad Clydie here. Misses him so much.\" She smoothed his hair as he kissed her, and Clyde,bethinking him of the shadow which lay so darkly between them, crushed her feverishly, desperately. \"Oh, mydarling baby girl,\" he exclaimed. \"My beautiful, beautiful Sondra! If you only knew how much I love you! If youonly knew! I wish I could tell you ALL. I wish I could.\"But he could not now--or ever. He would never dare to speak to her of even so much as a phase of the black barrier that now lay between them. For, with her training, the standards of love and marriage that had been set forher, she would never understand, never be willing to make so great a sacrifice for love, as much as she lovedhim. And he would be left, abandoned on the instant, and with what horror in her eyes! 　　Yet looking into his eyes, his face white and tense, and the glow of the moon above making small white electricsparks in his eyes, she exclaimed as he gripped her tightly: \"Does he love Sondra so much? Oh, sweetie boy! 　　Sondra loves him, too.\" She seized his head between her hands and held it tight, kissing him swiftly and ardentlya dozen times. \"And Sondra won\u0027t give her Clydie up either. She won\u0027t. You just wait and see! It doesn\u0027t matterwhat happens now. It may not be so very easy, but she won\u0027t.\" Then as suddenly and practically, as so often washer way, she exclaimed: \"But we must go now, right away. No, not another kiss now. No, no, Sondra says no,now. They\u0027ll be missing us.\" And straightening up and pulling him by the arm she hurried him back to the housein time to meet Palmer Thurston, who was looking for her. 　　The next morning, true to her promise, there was the canter to Inspiration Point, and that before seven--Bertineand Sondra in bright red riding coats and white breeches and black boots, their hair unbound and loose to thewind, and riding briskly on before for the most part; then racing back to where he was. Or Sondra halloing gaylyfor him to come on, or the two of them laughing and chatting a hundred yards ahead in some concealed chapel ofthe aisled trees where he could not see them. And because of the interest which Sondra was so obviouslymanifesting in him these days--an interest which Bertine herself had begun to feel might end in marriage, if nofamily complications arose to interfere--she, Bertine, was all smiles, the very soul of cordiality, winsomelyinsisting that he should come up and stay for the summer and she would chaperon them both so that no onewould have a chance to complain. And Clyde thrilling, and yet brooding too--by turns--occasionally--and inspite of himself drifting back to the thought that the item in the paper had inspired--and yet fighting it--trying toshut it out entirely. 　　And then at one point, Sondra, turning down a steep path which led to a stony and moss-lipped spring betweenthe dark trees, called to Clyde to \"Come on down. Jerry knows the way. He won\u0027t slip. Come and get a drink. Ifyou do, you\u0027ll come back again soon--so they say.\"And once he was down and had dismounted to drink, she exclaimed: \"I\u0027ve been wanting to tell you something. 　　You should have seen Mamma\u0027s face last night when she heard you were up here. She can\u0027t be sure that I hadanything to do with it, of course, because she thinks that Bertine likes you, too. I made her think that. But just thesame she suspects that I had a hand in it, I guess, and she doesn\u0027t quite like it. But she can\u0027t say anything morethan she has before. And I had a talk with Bertine just now and she\u0027s agreed to stick by me and help me all shecan. But we\u0027ll have to be even more careful than ever now, because I think if Mamma got too suspicious I don\u0027tknow what she might do--want us to leave here, even now maybe, just so I couldn\u0027t see you. You know she feelsthat I shouldn\u0027t be interested in any one yet except some one she likes. You know how it is. She\u0027s that way withStuart, too. But if you\u0027ll take care not to show that you care for me so much whenever we\u0027re around any one ofour crowd, I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll do anything--not now, anyhow. Later on, in the fall, when we\u0027re back in Lycurgus,things will be different. I\u0027ll be of age then, and I\u0027m going to see what I can do. I never loved any one before, but Ido love you, and, well, I won\u0027t give you up, that\u0027s all. I won\u0027t. And they can\u0027t make me, either!\"She stamped her foot and struck her boot, the while the two horses looked idly and vacantly about. And Clyde,enthused and astonished by this second definite declaration in his behalf, as well as fired by the thought that now, if ever, he might suggest the elopement and marriage and so rid himself of the sword that hung so threateninglyabove him, now gazed at Sondra, his eyes filled with a nervous hope and a nervous fear. For she might refuse,and change, too, shocked by the suddenness of his suggestion. And he had no money and no place in mind wherethey might go either, in case she accepted his proposal. But she had, perhaps, or she might have. And havingonce consented, might she not help him? Of course. At any rate, he felt that he must speak, leaving luck or illluck to the future. 　　And so he said: \"Why couldn\u0027t you run away with me now, Sondra, darling? It\u0027s so long until fall and I want youso much. Why couldn\u0027t we? Your mother\u0027s not likely to want to let you marry me then, anyhow. But if we wentaway now, she couldn\u0027t help herself, could she? And afterwards, in a few months or so, you could write her andthen she wouldn\u0027t mind. Why couldn\u0027t we, Sondra?\" His voice was very pleading, his eyes full of a sad dread ofrefusal-- and of the future that lay unprotected behind that. 　　And by now so caught was she by the tremor with which his mood invested him, that she paused--not reallyshocked by the suggestion at all--but decidedly moved, as well as flattered by the thought that she was able toevoke in Clyde so eager and headlong a passion. He was so impetuous--so blazing now with a flame of her owncreating, as she felt, yet which she was incapable of feeling as much as he, as she knew--such a flame as she hadnever seen in him or any one else before. And would it not be wonderful if she could run away with him now-secretly--to Canada or New York or Boston, or anywhere? The excitement her elopement would create here andelsewhere--in Lycurgus, Albany, Utica! The talk and feeling in her own family as well as elsewhere! And Gilbertwould be related to her in spite of him--and the Griffiths, too, whom her mother and father so much admired. 　　For a moment there was written in her eyes the desire and the determination almost, to do as he suggested--runaway--make a great lark of this, her intense and true love. For, once married, what could her parents do? Andwas not Clyde worthy of her and them, too? Of course--even though nearly all in her set fancied that he was notquite all he should be, just because he didn\u0027t have as much money as they had. But he would have--would henot--after he was married to her--and get as good a place in her father\u0027s business as Gil Griffiths had in hisfather\u0027s? 　　Yet a moment later, thinking of her life here and what her going off in such a way would mean to her father andmother just then--in the very beginning of the summer season--as well as how it would disrupt her own plans andcause her mother to feel especially angry, and perhaps even to bring about the dissolution of the marriage on theground that she was not of age, she paused--that gay light of adventure replaced by a marked trace of thepractical and the material that so persistently characterized her. What difference would a few months make,anyhow? It might, and no doubt would, save Clyde from being separated from her forever, whereas their presentcourse might insure their separation. 　　Accordingly she now shook her head in a certain, positive and yet affectionate way, which by now Clyde hadcome to know spelled defeat--the most painful and irremediable defeat that had yet come to him in connectionwith all this. She would not go! Then he was lost--lost--and she to him forever maybe. Oh, God! For while herface softened with a tenderness which was not usually there--even when she was most moved emotionally--shesaid: \"I would, honey, if I did not think it best not to, now. It\u0027s too soon. Mamma isn\u0027t going to do anything rightnow. I know she isn\u0027t. Besides she has made all her plans to do a lot of entertaining here this summer, and for myparticular benefit. She wants me to be nice to--well, you know who I mean. And I can be, without doing anything to interfere with us in any way, I\u0027m sure--so long as I don\u0027t do anything to really frighten her.\" She paused tosmile a reassuring smile. \"But you can come up here as often as you choose, don\u0027t you see, and she and theseothers won\u0027t think anything of it, because you won\u0027t be our guest, don\u0027t you see? I\u0027ve fixed all that with Bertine. 　　And that means that we can see each other all summer long up here, just about as much as we want to, don\u0027t yousee? Then in the fall, when I come back, and if I find that I can\u0027t make her be nice to you at all, or consider ourbeing engaged, why, I will run away with you. Yes, I will, darling--really and truly.\"Darling! The fall! 　　She stopped, her eyes showing a very shrewd conception of all the practical difficulties before them, while shetook both of his hands in hers and looked up into his face. Then, impulsively and conclusively, she threw botharms about his neck and, pulling his head down, kissed him. 　　\"Can\u0027t you see, dearie? Please don\u0027t look so sad, darling. Sondra loves her Clyde so much. And she\u0027ll do anythingand everything to make things come out right. Yes, she will. And they will, too. Now you wait and see. Shewon\u0027t give him up ever--ever!\"And Clyde, realizing that he had not one moving argument wherewith to confront her, really--not one that mightnot cause her to think strangely and suspiciously of his intense anxiety, and that this, because of Roberta\u0027sdemand, and unless--unless--well--, unless Roberta let him go it all spelled defeat for him, now looked gloomilyand even desperately upon her face. The beauty of her! The completeness of this world! And yet not to beallowed to possess her or it, ever. And Roberta with her demand and his promise in the immediate background! 　　And no way of escape save by flight! God! 　　At this point it was that a nervous and almost deranged look--never so definite or powerful at any time before inhis life--the border-line look between reason and unreason, no less--so powerful that the quality of it was evennoticeable to Sondra--came into his eyes. He looked sick, broken, unbelievably despairing. So much so that sheexclaimed, \"Why, what is it, Clyde, dearie--you look so--oh, I can\u0027t say just how--forlorn or--Does he love meso much? And can\u0027t he wait just three or four months? But, oh, yes he can, too. It isn\u0027t as bad as he thinks. He\u0027llbe with me most of the time--the lovekins will. And when he isn\u0027t, Sondra\u0027ll write him every day--every day.\"\"But, Sondra! Sondra! If I could just tell you. If you knew how much it were going to mean to me--\"He paused here, for as he could see at this point, into the expression of Sondra came a practical inquiry as towhat it was that made it so urgent for her to leave with him at once. And immediately, on his part, Clyde sensinghow enormous was the hold of this world on her--how integral a part of it she was--and how, by merely toomuch insistence here and now, he might so easily cause her to doubt the wisdom of her primary craze for him,was moved to desist, sure that if he spoke it would lead her to questioning him in such a way as might cause herto change--or at least to modify her enthusiasm to the point where even the dream of the fall might vanish. 　　And so, instead of explaining further why he needed a decision on her part, he merely desisted, saying: \"It\u0027sbecause I need you so much now, dear--all of the time. That\u0027s it, just that. It seems at times as though I couldnever be away from you another minute any more. Oh, I\u0027m so hungry for you all of the time.\"And yet Sondra, flattered as she was by this hunger, and reciprocating it in part at least, merely repeated thevarious things she had said before. They must wait. All would come out all right in the fall. And Clyde, quitenumb because of his defeat, yet unable to forego or deny the delight of being with her now, did his best torecover his mood--and think, think, think that in some way--somehow--maybe via that plan of that boat or insome other way! 　　But what other way? 　　But no, no, no--not that. He was not a murderer and never could be. He was not a murderer--never--never--never. 　　And yet this loss. 　　This impending disaster. 　　This impending disaster. 　　How to avoid that and win to Sondra after all.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16699.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
