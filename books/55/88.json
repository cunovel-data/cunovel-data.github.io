{"id":1696,"no":88,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 22","content":"And then, on the eleventh day, Frank W. Schaefer, clerk of the Renfrew House in Utica, recalling the actualarrival of Clyde and Roberta and their actions; also Clyde\u0027s registration for both as Mr. and Mrs. Clifford Golden,of Syracuse. And then Wallace Vanderhoff, one of the clerks of the Star Haberdashery in Utica, with a story ofClyde\u0027s actions and general appearance at the time of his buying a straw hat. And then the conductor of the trainrunning between Utica and Grass Lake. And the proprietor of the Grass Lake House. And Blanche Pettingill, awaitress, who swore that at dinner she overheard Clyde arguing with Roberta as to the impossibility of getting a marriage license there--that it would be better to wait until they reached some other place the next day--a bit ofparticularly damaging testimony, since it pre-dated by a day the proposed confession which Clyde was supposedto have made to Roberta, but which Jephson and Belknap afterward agreed between themselves might easilyhave had some preliminary phases. And after her the conductor of the train that carried them to Gun Lodge. Andafter him the guide and the driver of the bus, with his story of Clyde\u0027s queer talk about many people being overthere and leaving Roberta\u0027s bag while he took his own, and saying they would be back.\\n\\n 　　And then, the proprietor of the Inn at Big Bittern; the boatkeeper; the three men in the woods--their testimonyvery damaging to Clyde\u0027s case, since they pictured his terror on encountering them. And then the story of thefinding of the boat and Roberta\u0027s body, and the eventual arrival of Heit and his finding of the letter in Roberta\u0027scoat. A score of witnesses testifying as to all this. And next the boat captain, the farm girl, the Cranstonchauffeur, the arrival of Clyde at the Cranstons\u0027, and at last (every step accounted for and sworn to) his arrival atBear Lake, the pursuit and his capture--to say nothing of the various phases of his arrest--what he said--this beingmost damaging indeed, since it painted Clyde as false, evasive, and terrified.\\n\\n 　　But unquestionably, the severest and most damaging testimony related to the camera and the tripod--thecircumstances surrounding the finding of them--and on the weight of this Mason was counting for a conviction.\\n\\n 　　His one aim first was to convict Clyde of lying as to his possession of either a tripod or a camera. And in order todo that he first introduced Earl Newcomb, who swore that on a certain day, when he, Mason and Heit and all theothers connected with the case were taking Clyde over the area in which the crime had been committed, he and acertain native, one Bill Swartz, who was afterwards put on the stand, while poking about under some fallen logsand bushes, had come across the tripod, hidden under a log. Also (under the leadership of Mason, although overthe objections of both Belknap and Jephson, which were invariably overruled), he proceeded to add that Clyde,on being asked whether he had a camera or this tripod, had denied any knowledge of it, on hearing whichBelknap and Jephson actually shouted their disapproval.\\n\\n 　　Immediately following, though eventually ordered stricken from the records by Justice Oberwaltzer, there wasintroduced a paper signed by Heit, Burleigh, Slack, Kraut, Swenk, Sissel, Bill Swartz, Rufus Forster, countysurveyor, and Newcomb, which set forth that Clyde, on being shown the tripod and asked whether he had one,\"vehemently and repeatedly denied that he had.\" But in order to drive the import of this home, Masonimmediately adding: \"Very well, your Honor, but I have other witnesses who will swear to everything that is inthat paper and more,\" and at once calling \"Joseph Frazer! Joseph Frazer!\" and then placing on the stand a dealerin sporting goods, cameras, etc., who proceeded to swear that some time between May fifteenth and June first,the defendant, Clyde Griffiths, whom he knew by sight and name, had applied to him for a camera of a certainsize, with tripod attached, and that the defendant had finally selected a Sank, 3 1/2 by 5 1/2, for which he hadmade arrangements to pay in installments. And after due examination and consulting certain stock numbers withwhich the camera and the tripod and his own book were marked, Mr. Frazer identifying first the camera nowshown him, and immediately after that the yellow tripod as the one he had sold Clyde.\\n\\n 　　And Clyde sitting up aghast. Then they had found the camera, as well as the tripod, after all. And after he hadprotested so that he had no camera with him. What would that jury and the judge and this audience think of hislying about that? Would they be likely to believe his story of a change of heart after this proof that he had liedabout a meaningless camera? Better to have confessed in the first place.\\n\\n 　　But even as he was so thinking Mason calling Simeon Dodge, a young woodsman and driver, who testified thaton Saturday, the sixteenth of July, accompanied by John Pole, who had lifted Roberta\u0027s body out of the water, hehad at the request of the district attorney, repeatedly dived into the exact spot where her body was found, andfinally succeeded in bringing up a camera. And then the camera itself identified by Dodge.\\n\\n 　　Immediately after this all the testimony in regard to the hitherto as yet unmentioned films found in the camera atthe time of its recovery, since developed, and now received in evidence, four views which showed a personlooking more like Roberta than any one else, together with two, which clearly enough represented Clyde.\\n\\n 　　Belknap was not able to refute or exclude them.\\n\\n 　　Then Floyd Thurston, one of the guests at the Cranston lodge at Sharon on June eighteenth--the occasion ofClyde\u0027s first visit there--placed on the stand to testify that on that occasion Clyde had made a number of pictureswith a camera about the size and description of the one shown him, but failing to identify it as the particular one,his testimony being stricken out.\\n\\n 　　After him again, Edna Patterson, a chambermaid in the Grass Lake Inn, who, as she swore, on entering the roomwhich Clyde and Roberta occupied on the night of July seventh, had seen Clyde with a camera in his hand,which was of the size and color, as far as she could recall, of the one then and there before her. She had also atthe same time seen a tripod. And Clyde, in his curious and meditative and half-hypnotized state, recalling wellenough the entrance of this girl into that room and marveling and suffering because of the unbreakable chain offacts that could thus be built up by witnesses from such varying and unconnected and unexpected places, and solong after, too.\\n\\n 　　After her, but on different days, and with Belknap and Jephson contending every inch of the way as to theadmissibility of all this, the testimony of the five doctors whom Mason had called in at the time Roberta\u0027s bodywas first brought to Bridgeburg, and who in turn swore that the wounds, both on the face and head, weresufficient, considering Roberta\u0027s physical condition, to stun her. And because of the condition of the dead girl\u0027slungs, which had been tested by attempting to float them in water, averring that at the time her body had firstentered the water, she must have been still alive, although not necessarily conscious. But as to the nature of theinstrument used to make these wounds, they would not venture to guess, other than to say it must have beenblunt. And no grilling on the part of either Belknap or Jephson could bring them to admit that the blows couldhave been of such a light character as not to stun or render unconscious. The chief injury appeared to be on thetop of the skull, deep enough to have caused a blood clot, photographs of all of which were put in evidence.\\n\\n 　　At this psychological point, when both audience and jury were most painfully and effectively stirred, a numberof photographs of Roberta\u0027s face, made at the time that Heit, the doctors and the Lutz Brothers had her in charge,were introduced. Then the dimensions of the bruises on the right side of her face were shown to correspondexactly in size with two sides of the camera. Immediately after that, Burton Burleigh, placed on the stand toswear how he had discovered the two strands of hair which corresponded with the hair on Roberta\u0027s head--or soMason tried to show--caught between the lens and the lid. And then, after hours and hours, Belknap, infuriatedand yet made nervous by this type of evidence and seeking to riddle it with sarcasm, finally pulling a light hairout of his head and then asking the jurors and Burleigh if they could venture to tell whether one single hair fromany one\u0027s head could be an indication of the general color of a person\u0027s hair, and if not, whether they were readyto believe that this particular hair was from Roberta\u0027s head or not.\\n\\n 　　Mason then calling a Mrs. Rutger Donahue, who proceeded, in the calmest and most placid fashion, to tell howon the evening of July eighth last, between five-thirty and six, she and her husband immediately after setting up atent above Moon Cove, had started out to row and fish, when being about a half-mile off shore and perhaps aquarter of a mile above the woods or northern fringe of land which enclosed Moon Cove, she had heard a cry.\\n\\n 　　\"Between half past five and six in the afternoon, you say?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"And on what date again?\"\"July eighth.\"\"And where were you exactly at that time?\"\"We were--\"\"Not \u0027we.\u0027 Where were you personally?\"\"I was crossing what I have since learned was South Bay in a row- boat with my husband.\"\"Yes. Now tell what happened next.\"\"When we reached the middle of the bay I heard a cry.\"\"What was it like?\"\"It was penetrating--like the cry of some one in pain--or in danger. It was sharp--a haunting cry.\"Here a motion to \"strike out,\" with the result that the last phrase was so ordered stricken out.\\n\\n 　　\"Where did it come from?\"\"From a distance. From within or beyond the woods.\"\"Did you know at the time that there was another bay or cove there-- below that strip of woods?\"\"No, sir.\"\"Well, what did you think then--that it might have come from within the woods below where you were?\"(Objected to--and objection sustained.)\"And now tell us, was it a man\u0027s or a woman\u0027s cry? What kind of a cry was it?\"\"It was a woman\u0027s cry, and something like \u0027Oh, oh!\u0027 or \u0027Oh, my!\u0027--very piercing and clear, but distant, of course.\\n\\n 　　A double scream such as one might make when in pain.\"\"You are sure you could not be mistaken as to the kind of a cry it was--male or female.\"\"No, sir. I am positive. It was a woman\u0027s. It was pitched too high for a man\u0027s voice or a boy\u0027s. It could not havebeen anything but a woman\u0027s.\"\"I see. And now tell us, Mrs. Donahue--you see this dot on the map showing where the body of Roberta Aldenwas found?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"And you see this other dot, over those trees, showing approximately where your boat was?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"Do you think that voice came from where this dot in Moon Cove is?\"(Objected to. Sustained.)\"And was that cry repeated?\"\"No, sir. I waited, and I called my husband\u0027s attention to it, too, and we waited, but didn\u0027t hear it again.\"Then Belknap, eager to prove that it might have been a terrified and yet not a pained or injured cry, taking herand going all over the ground again, and finding that neither she nor her husband, who was also put on the stand,could be shaken in any way. Neither, they insisted, could the deep and sad effect of this woman\u0027s voice beeradicated from their minds. It had haunted both, and once in their camp again they had talked about it. Becauseit was dusk he did not wish to go seeking after the spot from which it came; because she felt that some woman orgirl might have been slain in those woods, she did not want to stay any longer, and the next morning early theyhad moved on to another lake.\\n\\n 　　Thomas Barrett, another Adirondack guide, connected with a camp at Dam\u0027s Lake, swore that at the time referredto by Mrs. Donahue, he was walking along the shore toward Big Bittern Inn and had seen not only a man andwoman off shore in about the position described, but farther back, toward the south shore of this bay, had notedthe tent of these campers. Also that from no point outside Moon Cove, unless near the entrance, could oneobserve any boat within the cove. The entrance was narrow and any view from the lake proper completelyblocked. And there were other witnesses to prove this.\\n\\n 　　At this psychological moment, as the afternoon sun was already beginning to wane in the tall, narrow courtroom,and as carefully planned by him beforehand, Mason\u0027s reading all of Roberta\u0027s letters, one by one, in a most simple and nondeclamatory fashion, yet with all the sympathy and emotion which their first perusal had stirred inhim. They had made him cry.\\n\\n 　　He began with letter number one, dated June eighth, only three days after her departure from Lycurgus, and onthrough them all down to letters fourteen, fifteen, sixteen and seventeen, in which, in piecemeal or by importantreferences here and there, she related her whole contact with Clyde down to his plan to come for her in threeweeks, then in a month, then on July eighth or ninth, and then the sudden threat from her which precipitated hissudden decision to meet her at Fonda. And as Mason read them, all most movingly, the moist eyes and thehandkerchiefs and the coughs in the audience and among the jurors attested their import:\\n\\n 　　\"You said I was not to worry or think so much about how I feel, and have a good time. That\u0027s all right for you tosay, when you\u0027re in Lycurgus and surrounded by your friends and invited everywhere. It\u0027s hard for me to talkover there at Wilcox\u0027s with somebody always in earshot and with you constantly reminding me that I mustn\u0027t saythis or that. But I had so much to ask and no chance there. And all that you would say was that everything was allright. But you didn\u0027t say positively that you were coming on the 27th, that because of something I couldn\u0027t quitemake out--there was so much buzzing on the wire--you might not be able to start until later. But that can\u0027t be,Clyde. My parents are leaving for Hamilton where my uncle lives on the third. And Tom and Emily are going tomy sister\u0027s on the same day. But I can\u0027t and won\u0027t go there again. I can\u0027t stay here all alone. So you must, youreally must come, as you agreed. I can\u0027t wait any longer than that, Clyde, in the condition that I\u0027m in, and so youjust must come and take me away. Oh, please, please, I beg of you, not to torture me with any more delays now.\"And again:\\n\\n 　　\"Clyde, I came home because I thought I could trust you. You told me so solemnly before I left that if I would,you would come and get me in three weeks at the most--that it would not take you longer than that to get ready,have enough money for the time we would be together, or until you could get something to do somewhere else.\\n\\n 　　But yesterday, although the third of July will be nearly a month since I left, you were not at all sure at first thatyou could come by then, and when as I told you my parents are surely leaving for Hamilton to be gone for tendays. Of course, afterwards, you said you would come, but you said it as though you were just trying to quiet me.\\n\\n 　　It has been troubling me awfully ever since.\\n\\n 　　\"For I tell you, Clyde, I am sick, very. I feel faint nearly all the time. And besides, I am so worried as to what Ishall do if you don\u0027t come that I am nearly out of my mind.\"\"Clyde, I know that you don\u0027t care for me any more like you did and that you are wishing things could bedifferent. And yet, what am I to do? I know you\u0027ll say that it has all been as much my fault as yours. And theworld, if it knew, might think so, too. But how often did I beg you not to make me do what I did not want to do,and which I was afraid even then I would regret, although I loved you too much to let you go, if you still insistedon having your way.\"\"Clyde, if I could only die. That would solve all this. And I have prayed and prayed that I would lately, yes Ihave. For life does not mean as much to me now as when I first met you and you loved me. Oh, those happydays! If only things were different. If only I were out of your way. It would all be so much better for me and forall of us. But I can\u0027t now, Clyde, without a penny and no way to save the name of our child, except this. Yet if it weren\u0027t for the terrible pain and disgrace it would bring to my mother and father and all my family, I would bewilling to end it all in another way. I truly would.\"And again:\\n\\n 　　\"Oh, Clyde, Clyde, life is so different to-day to what it was last year. Think--then we were going to Crum andthose other lakes over near Fonda and Gloversville and Little Falls, but now--now. Only just now some boy andgirl friends of Tom\u0027s and Emily\u0027s came by to get them to go after strawberries, and when I saw them go and knewI couldn\u0027t, and that I couldn\u0027t be like that any more ever, I cried and cried, ever so long.\"And finally:\\n\\n 　　\"I have been bidding good-by to some places to-day. There are so many nooks, dear, and all of them so dear tome. I have lived here all my life, you know. First, there was the springhouse with its great masses of green moss,and in passing it I said good-by to it, for I won\u0027t be coming to it soon again--maybe never. And then the old appletree where we had our playhouse years ago--Emily and Tom and Gifford and I. Then the \u0027Believe,\u0027 a cute littlehouse in the orchard where we sometimes played.\\n\\n 　　\"Oh, Clyde, you can\u0027t realize what all this means to me, I feel as though I shall never see my home again after Ileave here this time. And mamma, poor dear mamma, how I do love her and how sorry I am to have deceived herso. She is never cross and she always helps me so much. Sometimes I think if I could tell her, but I can\u0027t. She hashad trouble enough, and I couldn\u0027t break her heart like that. No, if I go away and come back some time, eithermarried or dead--it doesn\u0027t make so much difference now--she will never know, and I will not have caused herany pain, and that means so much more than life itself to me. So good-by, Clyde, until I do meet you, as youtelephoned. And forgive me all the trouble that I have caused you.\\n\\n 　　\"Your sorrowful,\"ROBERTA.\"And at points in the reading, Mason himself crying, and at their conclusion turning, weary and yet triumphant, amost complete and indestructible case, as he saw it, having been presented, and exclaiming: \"The People rest.\"And at that moment, Mrs. Alden, in court with her husband and Emily, and overwrought, not only by the longstrain of the trial but this particular evidence, uttering a whimpering yet clear cry and then falling forward in afaint. And Clyde, in his own overwrought condition, hearing her cry and seeing her fall, jumping up--therestraining hand of Jephson instantly upon him, while bailiffs and others assisted her and Titus who was besideher from the courtroom. And the audience almost, if not quite, as moved and incensed against Clyde by thatdevelopment as though, then and there, he had committed some additional crime.\\n\\n 　　But then, that excitement having passed and it being quite dark, and the hands of the court clock pointing to five,and all the court weary, Justice Oberwaltzer signifying his intention of adjourning for the night.\\n\\n 　　And at once all the newspaper men and feature writers and artists rising and whispering to each other that on themorrow the defense would start, and wondering as to who and where the witnesses were, also whether Clyde would be permitted to go on the stand in his own defense in the face of this amazing mass of evidence againsthim, or whether his lawyers would content themselves with some specious argument as to mental and moralweakness which might end in prison for life--not less.\\n\\n 　　And Clyde, hissed and cursed as he left the court, wondering if on the morrow, and as they had planned this longtime since, he would have the courage to rise and go on the stand--wondering if there was not some way, in caseno one was looking (he was not handcuffed as he went to and from the jail) maybe to-morrow night when allwere rising, the crowds moving and these deputies coming toward him--if--well, if he could only run, or walkeasily and quietly and yet, quickly and seemingly unintentionally, to that stair and then down and out--to--well-towherever it went--that small side door to the main stairs which before this he had seen from the jail! If hecould only get to some woods somewhere, and then walk and walk, or run and run, maybe, without stopping, andwithout eating, for days maybe, until, well, until he had gotten away--anywhere. It was a chance, of course. Hemight be shot, or tracked with dogs and men, but still it was a chance, wasn\u0027t it?\\n\\n 　　For this way he had no chance at all. No one anywhere, after all this, was going to believe him not guilty. And hedid not want to die that way. No, no, not that way!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16840.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
