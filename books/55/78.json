{"id":1686,"no":78,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 12","content":"And then out of the north woods a crime sensation of the first magnitude, with all of those intriguingly colorful,and yet morally and spiritually atrocious, elements--love, romance, wealth; poverty, death. And at oncepicturesque accounts of where and how Clyde had lived in Lycurgus, with whom he had been connected, how hehad managed to conceal his relations with one girl while obviously planning to elope with another--being wiredfor and published by that type of editor so quick to sense the national news value of crimes such as this. Andtelegrams of inquiry pouring in from New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco and other largeAmerican cities east and west, either to Mason direct or the representatives of the Associated or United Press inthis area, asking for further and more complete details of the crime. Who was this beautiful wealthy girl withwhom it was said this Griffiths was in love? Where did she live? What were Clyde\u0027s exact relations with her? YetMason, over-awed by the wealth of the Finchleys and the Griffiths, loath to part with Sondra\u0027s name, simplyasserting for the present that she was the daughter of a very wealthy manufacturer in Lycurgus, whose name hedid not care to furnish--yet not hesitating to show the bundle of letters carefully tied with a ribbon by Clyde.\\n\\n 　　But Roberta\u0027s letters on the other hand being described in detail,--even excerpts of some of them--the morepoetic and gloomy being furnished the Press for use, for who was there to protect her. And on their publication awave of hatred for Clyde as well as a wave of pity for her--the poor, lonely, country girl who had had no one buthim--and he cruel, faithless,--a murderer even. Was not hanging too good for him? For en route to and from BearLake, as well as since, Mason had pored over these letters. And because of certain intensely moving passagesrelating to her home life, her gloomy distress as to her future, her evident loneliness and weariness of heart, hehad been greatly moved, and later had been able to convey this feeling to others--his wife and Heit and the localnewspapermen. So much so that the latter in particular were sending from Bridgeburg vivid, if somewhatdistorted, descriptions of Clyde, his silence, his moodiness, and his hard-heartedness.\\n\\n 　　And then a particularly romantic young reporter from The Star, of Utica arriving at the home of the Aldens, therewas immediately given to the world a fairly accurate picture of the weary and defeated Mrs. Alden, who, too exhausted to protest or complain, merely contented herself with a sincere and graphic picture of Roberta\u0027sdevotion to her parents, her simple ways of living, her modesty, morality, religious devotion--how once the localpastor of the Methodist Church had said that she was the brightest and prettiest and kindest girl he had everknown, and how for years before leaving home she had been as her mother\u0027s own right hand. And thatundoubtedly because of her poverty and loneliness in Lycurgus, she had been led to listen to the honeyed wordsof this scoundrel, who, coming to her with promises of marriage, had lured her into this unhallowed and, in hercase, all but unbelievable relationship which had led to her death. For she was good and pure and sweet and kindalways. \"And to think that she is dead. I can\u0027t believe it.\"It was so that her mother was quoted.\\n\\n 　　\"Only Monday a week ago she was about--a little depressed, I thought, but smiling, and for some reason which Ithought odd at the time went all over the place Monday afternoon and evening, looking at things and gatheringsome flowers. And then she came over and put her arms around me and said: \u0027I wish I were a little girl again,Mamma, and that you would take me in your arms and rock me like you used to.\u0027 And I said, \u0027Why, Roberta,what makes you so sad to-night, anyhow?\u0027 And she said, \u0027Oh, nothing. You know I\u0027m going back in the morning.\\n\\n 　　And somehow I feel a little foolish about it to-night.\u0027 And to think that it was this trip that was in her mind. Isuppose she had a premonition that all would not work out as she had planned. And to think he struck my littlegirl, she who never could harm anything, not even a fly.\" And here, in spite of herself, and with the saddenedTitus in the background, she began to cry silently.\\n\\n 　　But from the Griffiths and other members of this local social world, complete and almost unbreakable silence.\\n\\n 　　For in so far as Samuel Griffiths was concerned, it was impossible for him at first either to grasp or believe thatClyde could be capable of such a deed. What! That bland and rather timid and decidedly gentlemanly youth, ashe saw him, charged with murder? Being rather far from Lycurgus at the time--Upper Saranac--where he wasreached with difficulty by Gilbert--he was almost unprepared to think, let alone act. Why, how impossible! Theremust be some mistake here. They must have confused Clyde with some one else.\\n\\n 　　Nevertheless, Gilbert proceeding to explain that it was unquestionably true, since the girl had worked in thefactory under Clyde, and the district attorney at Bridgeburg with whom he had already been in communicationhad assured him that he was in possession of letters which the dead girl had written to Clyde and that Clyde didnot attempt to deny them.\\n\\n 　　\"Very well, then,\" countered Samuel. \"Don\u0027t act hastily, and above all, don\u0027t talk to anyone outside of Smillie orGotboy until I see you. Where\u0027s Brookhart?\"--referring to Darrah Brookhart, of counsel for Griffiths \u0026Company.\\n\\n 　　\"He\u0027s in Boston to-day,\" returned his son. \"I think he told me last Friday that he wouldn\u0027t be back here untilMonday or Tuesday.\"\"Well, wire him that I want him to return at once. Incidentally, have Smillie see if he can arrange with the editorsof The Star and Beacon down there to suspend any comment until I get back. I\u0027ll be down in the morning. Alsotell him to get in the car and run up there\" (Bridgeburg) \"to-day if he can. I must know from first hand all there isto know. Have him see Clyde if he can, also this district attorney, and bring down any news that he can get. And all the newspapers. I want to see for myself what has been published.\"And at approximately the same time, in the home of the Finchleys on Fourth Lake, Sondra herself, after forty-eight hours of most macerating thoughts spent brooding on the astounding climax which had put a period to allher girlish fancies in regard to Clyde, deciding at last to confess all to her father, to whom she was more drawnthan to her mother. And accordingly approaching him in the library, where usually he sat after dinner, reading orconsidering his various affairs. But having come within earshot of him, beginning to sob, for truly she wasstricken in the matter of her love for Clyde, as well as her various vanities and illusions in regard to her own highposition, the scandal that was about to fall on her and her family. Oh, what would her mother say now, after allher warnings? And her father? And Gilbert Griffiths and his affianced bride? And the Cranstons, who except forher influence over Bertine, would never have been drawn into this intimacy with Clyde?\\n\\n 　　Her sobs arresting her father\u0027s attention, he at once paused to look up, the meaning of this quite beyond him. Yetinstantly sensing something very dreadful, gathering her up in his arms, and consolingly murmuring: \"There,there! For heaven\u0027s sake, what\u0027s happened to my little girl now? Who\u0027s done what and why?\" And then, with adecidedly amazed and shaken expression, listening to a complete confession of all that had occurred thus far--thefirst meeting with Clyde, her interest in him, the attitude of the Griffiths, her letters, her love, and then this--thisawful accusation and arrest. And if it were true! And her name were used, and her daddy\u0027s! And once more shefell to weeping as though her heart would break, yet knowing full well that in the end she would have her father\u0027ssympathy and forgiveness, whatever his subsequent suffering and mood.\\n\\n 　　And at once Finchley, accustomed to peace and order and tact and sense in his own home, looking at hisdaughter in an astounded and critical and yet not uncharitable way, and exclaiming: \"Well, well, of all things!\\n\\n 　　Well, I\u0027ll be damned! I am amazed, my dear! I am astounded! This is a little too much, I must say. Accused ofmurder! And with letters of yours in your own handwriting, you say, in his possession, or in the hands of thisdistrict attorney, for all we know by now. Tst! Tst! Tst! Damned foolish, Sondra, damned foolish! Your motherhas been talking to me for months about this, and you know I was taking your word for it against hers. And nowsee what\u0027s happened! Why couldn\u0027t you have told me or listened to her? Why couldn\u0027t you have talked all thisover with me before going so far? I thought we understood each other, you and I. Your mother and I have alwaysacted for your own good, haven\u0027t we? You know that. Besides, I certainly thought you had better sense. Really, Idid. But a murder case, and you connected with it! My God!\"He got up, a handsome blond man in carefully made clothes, and paced the floor, snapping his fingers irritably,while Sondra continued to weep. Suddenly, ceasing his walking, he turned again toward her and resumed with:\\n\\n 　　\"But, there, there! There\u0027s no use crying over it. Crying isn\u0027t going to fix it. Of course, we may be able to live itdown in some way. I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t guess what effect this is likely to have on you personally.\\n\\n 　　But one thing is sure. We do want to know something about those letters.\"And forthwith, and while Sondra wept on, he proceeded first to call his wife in order to explain the nature of theblow--a social blow that was to lurk in her memory as a shadow for the rest of her years--and next to call upLegare Atterbury, lawyer, state senator, chairman of the Republican State Central Committee and his own privatecounsel for years past, to whom he explained the amazing difficulty in which his daughter now found herself.\\n\\n 　　Also to inquire what was the most advisable thing to be done.\\n\\n 　　\"Well, let me see,\" came from Atterbury, \"I wouldn\u0027t worry very much if I were you, Mr. Finchley. I think I cando something to straighten this out for you before any real public damage is done. Now, let me see. Who is thedistrict attorney of Cataraqui County, anyhow? I\u0027ll have to look that up and get in touch with him and call youback. But never mind, I promise you I\u0027ll be able to do something--keep the letters out of the papers, anyhow.\\n\\n 　　Maybe out of the trial--I\u0027m not sure--but I am sure I can fix it so that her name will not be mentioned, so don\u0027tworry.\"And then Atterbury in turn calling up Mason, whose name he found in his lawyers\u0027 directory, and at oncearranging for a conference with him, since Mason seemed to think that the letters were most vital to his case,although he was so much overawed by Atterbury\u0027s voice that he was quick to explain that by no means had heplanned as yet to use publicly the name of Sondra or the letters either, but rather to reserve their actuality for theprivate inspection of the grand jury, unless Clyde should choose to confess and avoid a trial.\\n\\n 　　But Atterbury, after referring back to Finchley and finding him opposed to any use of the letters whatsoever, orSondra\u0027s name either, assuring him that on the morrow or the day after he would himself proceed to Bridgeburgwith some plans and political information which might cause Mason to think twice before he so much asconsidered referring to Sondra in any public way.\\n\\n 　　And then after due consideration by the Finchley family, it was decided that at once, and without explanation orapology to any one, Mrs. Finchley, Stuart and Sondra should leave for the Maine coast or any place satisfactoryto them. Finchley himself proposed to return to Lycurgus and Albany. It was not wise for any of them to beabout where they could be reached by reporters or questioned by friends. And forthwith, a hegira of theFinchleys to Narragansett, where under the name of Wilson they secluded themselves for the next six weeks.\\n\\n 　　Also, and because of the same cause the immediate removal of the Cranstons to one of the Thousand Islands,where there was a summer colony not entirely unsatisfactory to their fancy. But on the part of the Baggotts andthe Harriets, the contention that they were not sufficiently incriminated to bother and so remaining exactly wherethey were at Twelfth Lake. But all talking of Clyde and Sondra--this horrible crime and the probable socialdestruction of all those who had in any way been thus innocently defiled by it.\\n\\n 　　And in the interim, Smillie, as directed by Griffiths, proceeding to Bridgeburg, and after two long hours withMason, calling at the jail to see Clyde. And because of authorization from Mason being permitted to see himquite alone in his cell. Smillie having explained that it was not the intention of the Griffiths to try to set up anydefense for Clyde, but rather to discover whether under the circumstances there was a possibility for a defense,Mason had urged upon him the wisdom of persuading Clyde to confess, since, as he insisted, there was not theslightest doubt as to his guilt, and a trial would but cost the county money without result to Clyde--whereas if hechose to confess, there might be some undeveloped reasons for clemency--at any rate, a great social scandalprevented from being aired in the papers.\\n\\n 　　And thereupon Smillie proceeding to Clyde in his cell where brooding most darkly and hopelessly he waswondering how to do. Yet at the mere mention of Smillie\u0027s name shrinking as though struck. The Griffiths-SamuelGriffiths and Gilbert! Their personal representative. And now what would he say? For no doubt, as henow argued with himself, Smillie, having talked with Mason, would think him guilty. And what was he to saynow? What sort of a story tell--the truth or what? But without much time to think, for even while he was trying todo so Smillie had been ushered into his presence. And then moistening his dry lips with his tongue, he could only achieve, \"Why, how do you do, Mr. Smillie?\" to which the latter replied, with a mock geniality, \"Why, hello,Clyde, certainly sorry to see you tied up in a place like this.\" And then continuing: \"The papers and the districtattorney over here are full of a lot of stuff about some trouble you\u0027re in, but I suppose there can\u0027t be much to it-theremust be some mistake, of course. And that\u0027s what I\u0027m up here to find out. Your uncle telephoned me thismorning that I was to come up and see you to find out how they come to be holding you. Of course, you canunderstand how they feel down there. So they wanted me to come up and get the straight of it so as to get thecharge dismissed, if possible--so now if you\u0027ll just let me know the ins and outs of this--you know--that is--\"He paused there, confident because of what the district attorney had just told him, as well as Clyde\u0027s peculiarlynervous and recessive manner, that he would not have very much that was exculpatory to reveal.\\n\\n 　　And Clyde, after moistening his lips once more, beginning with: \"I suppose things do look pretty bad for me, Mr.\\n\\n 　　Smillie. I didn\u0027t think at the time that I met Miss Alden that I would ever get into such a scrape as this. But Ididn\u0027t kill her, and that\u0027s the God\u0027s truth. I never even wanted to kill her or take her up to that lake in the firstplace. And that\u0027s the truth, and that\u0027s what I told the district attorney. I know he has some letters from her to me,but they only show that she wanted me to go away with her--not that I wanted to go with her at all--\"He paused, hoping that Smillie would stamp this with his approval of faith. And Smillie, noting the agreementbetween his and Mason\u0027s assertions, yet anxious to placate him, returned: \"Yes, I know. He was just showingthem to me.\"\"I knew he would,\" continued Clyde, weakly. \"But you know how it is sometimes, Mr. Smillie,\" his voice,because of his fears that the sheriff or Kraut were listening, pitched very low. \"A man can get in a jam with a girlwhen he never even intended to at first. You know that yourself. I did like Roberta at first, and that\u0027s the truth,and I did get in with her just as those letters show. But you know that rule they have down there, that no one incharge of a department can have anything to do with any of the women under him. Well, that\u0027s what started allthe trouble for me, I guess. I was afraid to let any one know about it in the first place, you see.\"\"Oh, I see.\"And so by degrees, and growing less and less tense as he proceeded, since Smillie appeared to be listening withsympathy, he now outlined most of the steps of his early intimacy with Roberta, together with his presentdefense. But with no word as to the camera, or the two hats or the lost suit, which things were constantly andenormously troubling him. How could he ever explain these, really? And with Smillie at the conclusion of thisand because of what Mason had told him, asking: \"But what about those two hats, Clyde? This man over herewas telling me that you admit to having two straw hats--the one found on the lake and the one you wore awayfrom there.\"And Clyde, forced to say something, yet not knowing what, replying: \"But they\u0027re wrong as to my wearing astraw hat away from there, Mr. Smillie, it was a cap.\"\"I see. But still you did have a straw hat up at Bear Lake, he tells me.\"\"Yes, I had one there, but as I told him, that was the one I had with me when I went up to the Cranstons\u0027 the first time. I told him that. I forgot it and left it there.\"\"Oh, I see. But now there was something about a suit--a gray one, I believe--that he says you were seen wearingup there but that he can\u0027t find now? Were you wearing one?\"\"No. I was wearing the blue suit I had on when I came down here. They\u0027ve taken that away now and given methis one.\"\"But he says that you say you had it dry-cleaned at Sharon but that he can\u0027t find any one there who knowsanything about it. How about that? Did you have it dry-cleaned there?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"By whom?\"\"Well, I can\u0027t just remember now. But I think I can find the man if I were to go up there again--he\u0027s near thedepot,\" but at the same time looking down and away from Smillie.\\n\\n 　　And then Smillie, like Mason before him, proceeding to ask about the bag in the boat, and whether it had notbeen possible, if he could swim to shore with his shoes and suit on, for him to have swam to Roberta and assistedher to cling to the overturned boat. And Clyde explaining, as before, that he was afraid of being dragged down,but adding now, for the first time, that he had called to her to hang on to the boat, whereas previously he had saidthat the boat drifted away from them. And Smillie recalled that Mason had told him this. Also, in connectionwith Clyde\u0027s story of the wind blowing his hat off, Mason had said he could prove by witnesses, as well as the U.\\n\\n 　　S. Government reports, that there was not a breath of air stirring on that most halcyon day. And so, plainly,Clyde was lying. His story was too thin. Yet Smillie, not wishing to embarrass him, kept saying: \"Oh, I see,\" or,\"To be sure,\" or \"That\u0027s the way it was, was it?\"And then finally asking about the marks on Roberta\u0027s face and head. For Mason had called his attention to themand insisted that no blow from a boat would make both abrasions. But Clyde sure that the boat had only struckher once and that all the bruises had come from that or else he could not guess from what they had come. Butthen beginning to see how hopeless was all this explanation. For it was so plain from his restless, troubledmanner that Smillie did not believe him. Quite obviously he considered his not having aided Roberta asdastardly--a thin excuse for letting her die.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16830.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
