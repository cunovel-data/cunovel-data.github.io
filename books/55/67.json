{"id":1675,"no":67,"title":"Part 3 chapter 1","content":"Cataraqui County extending from the northernmost line of the village known as Three Mile Bay on the south tothe Canadian border, on the north a distance of fifty miles. And from Senaschet and Indian Lakes on the east tothe Rock and Scarf Rivers on the west--a width of thirty miles. Its greater portion covered by uninhabited forestsand lakes, yet dotted here and there with such villages and hamlets as Koontz, Grass Lake, North Wallace,Brown Lake, with Bridgeburg, the county seat, numbering no less than two thousand souls of the fifteenthousand in the entire county. And the central square of the town occupied by the old and yet not ungracefulcounty courthouse, a cupola with a clock and some pigeons surmounting it, the four principal business streets ofthe small town facing it.\\n\\n 　　In the office of the County Coroner in the northeast corner of the building on Friday, July ninth, one Fred Heit,coroner, a large and broad-shouldered individual with a set of gray-brown whiskers such as might have graced aMormon elder. His face was large and his hands and his feet also. And his girth was proportionate.\\n\\n 　　At the time that this presentation begins, about two-thirty in the afternoon, he was lethargically turning the leavesof a mail-order catalogue for which his wife had asked him to write. And while deciphering from its pages theprice of shoes, jackets, hats, and caps for his five omnivorous children, a greatcoat for himself of soothingproportions, high collar, broad belt, large, impressive buttons chancing to take his eye, he had paused to considerregretfully that the family budget of three thousand dollars a year would never permit of so great luxury thiscoming winter, particularly since his wife, Ella, had had her mind upon a fur coat for at least three winters past.\\n\\n 　　However his thoughts might have eventuated on this occasion, they were interrupted by the whirr of a telephonebell.\\n\\n 　　\"Yes, this is Mr. Heit speaking--Wallace Upham of Big Bittern. Why, yes, go on, Wallace--young coupledrowned--all right, just wait a minute--\"He turned to the politically active youth who drew a salary from the county under the listing of \"secretary to thecoroner\"--\"Get these points, Earl.\" Then into the telephone: \"All right, Wallace, now give me all the facts-everything--yes. The body of the wife found but not that of the husband--yes--a boat upset on the south shore-yes--straw hat without any lining--yes--some marks about her mouth and eye--her coat and hat at the inn--yes--aletter in one of the pockets of the coat--addressed to who?--Mrs. Titus Alden, Biltz, Mimico County--yes--still dragging for the man\u0027s body, are they?--yes--no trace of him yet--I see. All right, Wallace--Well--I\u0027ll tell you,Wallace, have them leave the coat and hat just where they are. Let me see--it\u0027s two-thirty now. I\u0027ll be up on thefour o\u0027clock. The bus from the inn there meets that, doesn\u0027t it? Well, I\u0027ll be over on that, sure--And, Wallace, Iwish you\u0027d write down the names of all present who saw the body brought up. What was that?--eighteen feet ofwater at least?--yes--a veil caught in one of the rowlocks--yes--a brown veil--yes--sure, that\u0027s all--Well, thenhave them leave everything just as found, Wallace, and I\u0027ll be right up. Yes, Wallace, thank you-- Goodbye.\"Slowly Mr. Heit restored the receiver to the hook and as slowly arose from the capacious walnut-hued chair inwhich he sat, stroking his heavy whiskers, while he eyed Earl Newcomb, combination typist, record clerk, andwhat not.\\n\\n 　　\"You got all that down, did you, Earl?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"Well, you better get your hat and coat and come along with me. We\u0027ll have to catch that 3:10. You can fill in afew subpoenas on the train. I should say you better take fifteen or twenty--to be on the safe side, and take thenames of such witnesses as we can find on the spot. And you better call up Mrs. Heit and say \u0027taint likely I\u0027ll behome for dinner tonight or much before the down train. We may have to stay up there until tomorrow. You nevercan tell in these cases how they\u0027re going to turn out and it\u0027s best to be on the safe side.\"Heit turned to a coat-room in one corner of the musty old room and extracted a large, soft-brimmed, straw hat,the downward curving edges of which seemed to heighten the really bland and yet ogreish effect of hisprotruding eyes and voluminous whiskers, and having thus equipped himself, said: \"I\u0027m just going in the sheriff\u0027soffice a minute, Earl. You\u0027d better call up the Republican and the Democrat and tell \u0027em about this, so they won\u0027tthink we\u0027re slightin\u0027 \u0027em. Then I\u0027ll meet you down at the station.\" And he lumbered out.\\n\\n 　　And Earl Newcomb, a tall, slender, shock-headed young man of perhaps nineteen, and of a very serious, if attimes befuddled, manner, at once seized a sheaf of subpoenas, and while stuffing these in his pocket, sought toget Mrs. Heit on the telephone. And then, after explaining to the newspapers about a reported double drowning atBig Bittern, he seized his own blue-banded straw hat, some two sizes too large for him, and hurried down thehall, only to encounter, opposite the wide-open office door of the district attorney, Zillah Saunders, spinster andsolitary stenographer to the locally somewhat famous and mercurial Orville W. Mason, district attorney. She wason her way to the auditor\u0027s office, but being struck by the preoccupation and haste of Mr. Newcomb, usually somuch more deliberate, she now called: \"Hello, Earl. What\u0027s the rush? Where you going so fast?\"\"Double drowning up at Big Bittern, we hear. Maybe something worse. Mr. Heit\u0027s going up and I\u0027m going along.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16819.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
