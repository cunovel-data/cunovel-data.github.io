{"id":1617,"no":9,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 9","content":"And so the interesting dinner, with Clyde attending, came to pass. And it was partaken of at Frissell\u0027s, as Rattererhad said. And by now Clyde, having come to be on genial terms with all of these youths, was in the gayest ofmoods about it all. Think of his new state in life, anyhow. Only a few weeks ago he was all alone, not a boyfriend, scarcely a boy acquaintance in the world! And here he was, so soon after, going to this fine dinner withthis interesting group.\n 　　And true to the illusions of youth, the place appeared far more interesting than it really was. It was little morethan an excellent chop-house of the older American order. Its walls were hung thick with signed pictures ofactors and actresses, together with playbills of various periods. And because of the general excellence of thefood, to say nothing of the geniality of its present manager, it had become the hangout of passing actors,politicians, local business men, and after them, the generality of followers who are always drawn by that whichpresents something a little different to that with which they are familiar.\n 　　And these boys, having heard at one time and another from cab and taxi drivers that this was one of the bestplaces in town, fixed upon it for their monthly dinners. Single plates of anything cost from sixty cents to a dollar.\n 　　Coffee and tea were served in pots only. You could get anything you wanted to drink. To the left of the mainroom as you went in was a darker and low-ceilinged room with a fireplace, to which only men resorted and satand smoked, and read papers after dinner, and it was for this room that these youths reserved their greatestadmiration. Eating here, they somehow felt older, wiser, more important--real men of the world. And Rattererand Hegglund, to whom by now Clyde had become very much attached, as well as most of the others, weresatisfied that there was not another place in all Kansas City that was really as good.\n 　　And so this day, having drawn their pay at noon, and being off at six for the night, they gathered outside the hotelat the corner nearest the drug store at which Clyde had originally applied for work, and were off in a happy,noisy frame of mind--Hegglund, Ratterer, Paul Shiel, Davis Higby, another youth, Arthur Kinsella and Clyde.\n 　　\"Didja hear de trick de guy from St. Louis pulled on the main office yesterday?\" Hegglund inquired of the crowdgenerally, as they started walking. \"Wires last Saturday from St. Louis for a parlor, bedroom and bat for himselfand wife, an\u0027 orders flowers put in de room. Jimmy, the key clerk, was just tellin\u0027 me. Den he comes on here andregisters himself an\u0027 his girl, see, as man and wife, an\u0027, gee, a peach of a lookin\u0027 girl, too--I saw \u0027em. Listen, youfellows, cantcha? Den, on Wednesday, after he\u0027s been here tree days and dey\u0027re beginnin\u0027 to wonder about him alittle--meals sent to de room and all dat--he comes down and says dat his wife\u0027s gotta go back to St. Louis, anddat he won\u0027t need no suite, just one room, and dat they can transfer his trunk and her bags to de new room untiltrain time for her. But de trunk ain\u0027t his at all, see, but hers. And she ain\u0027t goin\u0027, don\u0027t know nuttin about it. But heis. Den he beats it, see, and leaves her and de trunk in de room. And widout a bean, see? Now, dey\u0027re holdin\u0027 herand her trunk, an\u0027 she\u0027s cryin\u0027 and wirin\u0027 friends, and dere\u0027s hell to pay all around. Can ya beat dat? An\u0027 deflowers, too. Roses. An\u0027 six different meals in de room and drinks for him, too.\"\"Sure, I know the one you mean,\" exclaimed Paul Shiel. \"I took up some drinks myself. I felt there wassomething phony about that guy. He was too smooth and loud-talking. An\u0027 he only comes across with a dime atthat.\"\"I remember him, too,\" exclaimed Ratterer. \"He sent me down for all the Chicago papers Monday an\u0027 only giveme a dime. He looked like a bluff to me.\"\"Well, dey fell for him up in front, all right.\" It was Hegglund talking. \"An\u0027 now dey\u0027re tryin\u0027 to gouge it outa her.\n 　　Can you beat it?\"\"She didn\u0027t look to me to be more than eighteen or twenty, if she\u0027s that old,\" put in Arthur Kinsella, who up tonow had said nothing.\n 　　\"Did you see either of \u0027em, Clyde?\" inquired Ratterer, who was inclined to favor and foster Clyde and includehim in everything.\n 　　\"No\" replied Clyde. \"I must have missed those two. I don\u0027t remember seeing either of \u0027em.\"\"Well, you missed seein\u0027 a bird when you missed that one. Tall, long black cut-a-way coat, wide, black derbypulled low over his eyes, pearl-gray spats, too. I thought he was an English duke or something at first, the way hewalked, and with a cane, too. All they gotta do is pull that English stuff, an\u0027 talk loud an\u0027 order everybody aboutan\u0027 they get by with it every time.\"\"That\u0027s right,\" commented Davis Higby. \"That\u0027s good stuff, that English line. I wouldn\u0027t mind pulling some of itmyself sometime.\"They had now turned two corners, crossed two different streets and, in group formation, were making their way through the main door of Frissell\u0027s, which gave in on the reflection of lights upon china and silverware and faces,and the buzz and clatter of a dinner crowd. Clyde was enormously impressed. Never before, apart from theGreen-Davidson, had he been in such a place. And with such wise, experienced youths.\n 　　They made their way to a group of tables which faced a leather wall-seat. The head-waiter, recognizing Rattererand Hegglund and Kinsella as old patrons, had two tables put together and butter and bread and glasses brought.\n 　　About these they arranged themselves, Clyde with Ratterer and Higby occupying the wall seat; Hegglund,Kinsella and Shiel sitting opposite.\n 　　\"Now, me for a good old Manhattan, to begin wit\u0027,\" exclaimed Hegglund avidly, looking about on the crowd inthe room and feeling that now indeed he was a person. Of a reddish-tan hue, his eyes keen and blue, his reddish-brown hair brushed straight up from his forehead, he seemed not unlike a large and overzealous rooster.\n 　　And similarly, Arthur Kinsella, once he was in here, seemed to perk up and take heart of his present glory. In asort of ostentatious way, he drew back his coat sleeves, seized a bill of fare, and scanning the drink-list on theback, exclaimed: \"Well, a dry Martini is good enough for a start.\"\"Well, I\u0027m going to begin with a Scotch and soda,\" observed Paul Shiel, solemnly, examining at the same timethe meat orders.\n 　　\"None of your cocktails for me to-night,\" insisted Ratterer, genially, but with a note of reserve in his voice. \"Isaid I wasn t going to drink much to-night, and I\u0027m not. I think a glass of Rhine wine and seltzer will be about myspeed.\"\"For de love o\u0027 Mike, will you listen to dat, now,\" exclaimed Hegglund, deprecatingly. \"He\u0027s goin\u0027 to begin onRhine wine. And him dat likes Manhattans always. What\u0027s gettin\u0027 into you all of a sudden, Tommy? I t\u0027ought yousaid you wanted a good time to- night.\"\"So I do,\" replied Ratterer, \"but can\u0027t I have a good time without lappin\u0027 up everything in the place? I want to staysober to-night. No more call-downs for me in the morning, if I know what I\u0027m about. I came pretty near notshowing up last time.\"\"That\u0027s true, too,\" exclaimed Arthur Kinsella. \"I don\u0027t want to drink so much I don\u0027t know where I\u0027m at, but I\u0027mnot going to begin worrying about it now.\"\"How about you, Higby?\" Hegglund now called to the round-eyed youth.\n 　　\"I\u0027m having a Manhattan, too,\" he replied, and then, looking up at the waiter who was beside him, added, \"How\u0027stricks, Dennis?\"\"Oh, I can\u0027t complain,\" replied the waiter. \"They\u0027re breakin\u0027 all right for me these days. How\u0027s everything over tothe hotel?\"\"Fine, fine,\" replied Higby, cheerfully, studying the bill-of-fare.\n 　　\"An\u0027 you, Griffiths? What are you goin\u0027 to have?\" called Hegglund, for, as master-of-ceremonies, delegated bythe others to look after the orders and pay the bill and tip the waiter, he was now fulfilling the role.\n 　　\"Who, me? Oh, me,\" exclaimed Clyde, not a little disturbed by this inquiry, for up to now--this very hour, infact--he had never touched anything stronger than coffee or ice-cream soda. He had been not a little taken backby the brisk and sophisticated way in which these youths ordered cocktails and whisky. Surely he could not go sofar as that, and yet, so well had he known long before this, from the conversation of these youths, that on suchoccasions as this they did drink, that he did not see how he could very well hold back. What would they think ofhim if he didn\u0027t drink something? For ever since he had been among them, he had been trying to appear as muchof a man of the world as they were. And yet back of him, as he could plainly feel, lay all of the years in which hehad been drilled in the \"horrors\" of drink and evil companionship. And even though in his heart this long whilehe had secretly rebelled against nearly all the texts and maxims to which his parents were always alluding,deeply resenting really as worthless and pointless the ragamuffin crew of wasters and failures whom they werealways seeking to save, still, now he was inclined to think and hesitate. Should he or should he not drink?\n 　　For the fraction of an instant only, while all these things in him now spoke, he hesitated, then added: \"Why, I,oh--I think I\u0027ll take Rhine wine and seltzer, too.\" It was the easiest and safest thing to say, as he saw it. Alreadythe rather temperate and even innocuous character of Rhine wine and seltzer had been emphasized by Hegglundand all the others. And yet Ratterer was taking it--a thing which made his choice less conspicuous and, as he felt,less ridiculous.\n 　　\"Will you listen to dis now?\" exclaimed Hegglund, dramatically. \"He says he\u0027ll have Rhine wine and seltzer, too.\n 　　I see where dis party breaks up at half-past eight, all right, unless some of de rest of us do someting.\"And Davis Higby, who was far more trenchant and roistering than his pleasant exterior gave any indication of,turned to Ratterer and said: \"Whatja want to start this Rhine wine and seltzer stuff for, so soon, Tom? Dontchawant us to have any fun at all to-night?\"\"Well, I told you why,\" said Ratterer. \"Besides, the last time I went down to that joint I had forty bucks when Iwent in and not a cent when I came out. I want to know what\u0027s goin\u0027 on this time.\"\"That joint,\" thought Clyde on hearing it. Then, after this supper, when they had all drunk and eaten enough, theywere going down to one of those places called a \"joint\"--a bad-house, really. There was no doubt of it--he knewwhat the word meant. There would be women there--bad women--evil women. And he would be expected-couldhe--would he?\n 　　For the first time in his life now, he found himself confronted by a choice as to his desire for the more accurateknowledge of the one great fascinating mystery that had for so long confronted and fascinated and baffled andyet frightened him a little. For, despite all his many thoughts in regard to all this and women in general, he hadnever been in contact with any one of them in this way. And now--now-All of a sudden he felt faint thrills of hot and cold racing up and down his back and all over him. His hands andface grew hot and then became moist--then his cheeks and forehead flamed. He could feel them. Strange, swift, enticing and yet disturbing thoughts raced in and out of his consciousness. His hair tingled and he saw pictures-bacchanalianscenes--which swiftly, and yet in vain, he sought to put out of his mind. They would keep comingback. And he wanted them to come back. Yet he did not. And through it all he was now a little afraid. Pshaw!\n 　　Had he no courage at all? These other fellows were not disturbed by the prospects of what was before them.\n 　　They were very gay. They were already beginning to laugh and kid one another in regard to certain funny thingsthat had happened the last time they were all out together. But what would his mother think if she knew? Hismother! He dared not think of his mother or his father either at this time, and put them both resolutely out of hismind.\n 　　\"Oh, say, Kinsella,\" called Higby. \"Do you remember that little red head in that Pacific Street joint that wantedyou to run away to Chicago with her?\"\"Do I?\" replied the amused Kinsella, taking up the Martini that was just then served him. \"She even wanted meto quit the hotel game and let her start me in a business of some kind. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t need to work at all if I stuck byher,\u0027 she told me.\"\"Oh, no, you wouldn\u0027t need to work at all, except one way,\" called Ratterer.\n 　　The waiter put down Clyde\u0027s glass of Rhine wine and seltzer beside him and, interested and intense and troubledand fascinated by all that he heard, he picked it up, tasted it and, finding it mild and rather pleasing, drank it alldown at once. And yet so wrought up were his thoughts that he scarcely realized then that he had drunk it.\n 　　\"Good for you,\" observed Kinsella, in a most cordial tone. \"You must like that stuff.\"\"Oh, it\u0027s not so bad,\" said Clyde.\n 　　And Hegglund, seeing how swiftly it had gone, and feeling that Clyde, new to this world and green, needed to becheered and strengthened, called to the waiter: \"Here Jerry! One more of these, and make it a big one,\" hewhispered behind his hand.\n 　　And so the dinner proceeded. And it was nearly eleven before they had exhausted the various matters of interestto them--stories of past affairs, past jobs, past feats of daring. And by then Clyde had had considerable time tomeditate on all of these youths--and he was inclined to think that he was not nearly as green as they thought, or ifso, at least shrewder than most of them--of a better mentality, really. For who were they and what were theirambitions? Hegglund, as he could see, was vain and noisy and foolish--a person who could be taken in andconciliated by a little flattery. And Higby and Kinsella, interesting and attractive boys both, were still vain ofthings he could not be proud of--Higby of knowing a little something about automobiles--he had an uncle in thebusiness--Kinsella of gambling, rolling dice even. And as for Ratterer and Shiel, he could see and had noticed forsome time, that they were content with the bell-hop business--just continuing in that and nothing more--a thingwhich he could not believe, even now, would interest him forever.\n 　　At the same time, being confronted by this problem of how soon they would be wanting to go to a place intowhich he had never ventured before, and to be doing things which he had never let himself think he would do injust this way, he was just a little disturbed. Had he not better excuse himself after they got outside, or perhaps, after starting along with them in whatsoever direction they chose to go, quietly slip away at some corner andreturn to his own home? For had he not already heard that the most dreadful of diseases were occasionallycontracted in just such places--and that men died miserable deaths later because of low vices begun in thisfashion? He could hear his mother lecturing concerning all this--yet with scarcely any direct knowledge of anykind. And yet, as an argument per contra, here were all of these boys in nowise disturbed by what was in theirminds or moods to do. On the contrary, they were very gay over it all and amused--nothing more.\n 　　In fact, Ratterer, who was really very fond of Clyde by now, more because of the way he looked and inquiredand listened than because of anything Clyde did or said, kept nudging him with his elbow now and then, askinglaughingly, \"How about it, Clyde? Going to be initiated to-night?\" and then smiling broadly. Or finding Clydequite still and thinking at times, \"They won\u0027t do more than bite you, Clyde.\"And Hegglund, taking his cue from Ratterer and occasionally desisting from his own self-glorifying diatribes,would add: \"You won\u0027t ever be de same, Clyde. Dey never are. But we\u0027ll all be wid you in case of trouble.\"And Clyde, nervous and irritated, would retort: \"Ah, cut it out, you two. Quit kidding. What\u0027s the use of trying tomake out that you know so much more than I do?\"And Ratterer would signal Hegglund with his eyes to let up and would occasionally whisper to Clyde: \"That\u0027s allright, old man, don\u0027t get sore. You know we were just fooling, that\u0027s all.\" And Clyde, very much drawn toRatterer, would relent and wish he were not so foolish as to show what he actually was thinking about.\n 　　At last, however, by eleven o\u0027clock, they had had their fill of conversation and food and drink and were ready todepart, Hegglund leading the way. And instead of the vulgar and secretive mission producing a kind of solemnityand mental or moral self-examination and self-flagellation, they laughed and talked as though there was nothingbut a delicious form of amusement before them. Indeed, much to Clyde\u0027s disgust and amazement, they nowbegan to reminisce concerning other ventures into this world--of one particular one which seemed to amuse themall greatly, and which seemed to concern some \"joint,\" as they called it, which they had once visited--a placecalled \"Bettina\u0027s.\" They had been led there originally by a certain wild youth by the name of \"Pinky\" Jones of thestaff of another local hotel. And this boy and one other by the name of Birmingham, together with Hegglund,who had become wildly intoxicated, had there indulged in wild pranks which all but led to their arrest--prankswhich to Clyde, as he listened to them, seemed scarcely possible to boys of this caliber and cleanly appearance-pranksso crude and disgusting as to sicken him a little.\n 　　\"Oh, ho, and de pitcher of water de girl on de second floor doused on me as I went out,\" called Hegglund,laughing heartily.\n 　　\"And the big fat guy on the second floor that came to the door to see. Remember?\" laughed Kinsella. \"Hethought there was a fire or a riot, I bet.\"\"And you and that little fat girl, Piggy. \u0027Member, Ratterer?\" squealed Shiel, laughing and choking as he tried totell of it.\n 　　\"And Ratterer\u0027s legs all bent under his load. Yoo-hoo!\" yelled Hegglund. \"And de way de two of \u0027em finally slid down de steps.\"\"That was all your fault, Hegglund,\" called Higby from Kinsella\u0027s side. \"If you hadn\u0027t tried that switching stuffwe never woulda got put out.\"\"I tell you I was drunk,\" protested Ratterer. \"It was the red-eye they sold in there.\"\"And that long, thin guy from Texas with the big mustache, will you ever forget him, an\u0027 the way he laughed?\"added Kinsella. \"He wouldn\u0027t help nobody \u0027gainst us. \u0027Member?\"\"It\u0027s a wonder we weren\u0027t all thrown in the street or locked up. Oh, gee, what a night!\" reminisced Ratterer.\n 　　By now Clyde was faintly dizzy with the nature of these revelations. \"Switchin\u0027.\" That could mean but one thing.\n 　　And they expected him to share in revels such as these, maybe. It could not be. He was not that sort of person.\n 　　What would his mother and father think if they were to hear of such dreadful things? And yet-Even as they talked, they had reached a certain house in a dark and rather wide street, the curbs of which for ablock or more on either side were sprinkled with cabs and cars. And at the corner, only a little distance away,were some young men standing and talking. And over the way, more men. And not a half a block farther on, theypassed two policemen, idling and conversing. And although there was no light visible in any window, nor overany transom, still, curiously, there was a sense of vivid, radiant life. One could feel it in this dark street. Taxisspun and honked and two old-time closed carriages still in use rolled here and there, their curtains drawn. Anddoors slammed or opened and closed. And now and then a segment of bright inward light pierced the outwardgloom and then disappeared again. Overhead on this night were many stars.\n 　　Finally, without any comment from any one, Hegglund, accompanied by Higby and Shiel, marched up the stepsof this house and rang the bell. Almost instantly the door was opened by a black girl in a red dress. \"Goodevening. Walk right in, won\u0027t you?\" was the affable greeting, and the six, having pushed past her and through thecurtains of heavy velvet, which separated this small area from the main chambers, Clyde found himself in abright and rather gaudy general parlor or reception room, the walls of which were ornamented with gilt-framedpictures of nude or semi-nude girls and some very high pier mirrors. And the floor was covered by a bright redthick carpet, over which were strewn many gilt chairs. At the back, before some very bright red hangings, was agilded upright piano. But of guests or inmates there seemed to be none, other than the black girl.\n 　　\"Jest be seated, won\u0027t you? Make yourselves at home. I\u0027ll call the madam.\" And, running upstairs to the left, shebegan calling: \"Oh, Marie! Sadie! Caroline! They is some young gentlemen in the parlor.\"And at that moment, from a door in the rear, there emerged a tall, slim and rather pale-faced woman of aboutthirty-eight or forty--very erect, very executive, very intelligent and graceful-looking--diaphanously and yetmodestly garbed, who said, with a rather wan and yet encouraging smile: \"Oh, hello, Oscar, it\u0027s you, is it? Andyou too, Paul. Hello! Hello, Davis! Just make yourselves at home anywhere, all of you. Fannie will be in in aminute. She\u0027ll bring you something to drink. I\u0027ve just hired a new pianist from St. Joe--a Negro. Wait\u0027ll you hearhim. He\u0027s awfully clever.\"She returned to the rear and called, \"Oh, Sam!\"As she did so, nine girls of varying ages and looks, but none apparently over twenty-four or five--came troopingdown the stairs at one side in the rear, and garbed as Clyde had never seen any women dressed anywhere. Andthey were all laughing and talking as they came--evidently very well pleased with themselves and in nowiseashamed of their appearance, which in some instances was quite extraordinary, as Clyde saw it, their costumesranging from the gayest and flimsiest of boudoir negligees to the somewhat more sober, if no less revealing,dancing and ballroom gowns. And they were of such varied types and sizes and complexions--slim and stout andmedium--tall or short--and dark or light or betwixt. And, whatever their ages, all seemed young. And they smiledso warmly and enthusiastically.\n 　　\"Oh, hello, sweetheart! How are you? Don\u0027t you want to dance with me?\" or \"Wouldn\u0027t you like something todrink?\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16646.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
