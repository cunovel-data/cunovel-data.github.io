{"id":1677,"no":69,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 3","content":"Coroner Heit, his official duties completed for the time being, found himself pondering, as he traveled south onthe lake train, how he was to proceed farther. What was the next step he should take in this pathetic affair? Forthe coroner, as he had looked at Roberta before he left was really deeply moved. She seemed so young andinnocent-looking and pretty. The little blue serge dress lying heavily and clinging tightly to her, her very smallhands folded across her breast, her warm, brown hair still damp from its twenty-four hours in the water, yetsomehow suggesting some of the vivacity and passion that had invested her in life--all seemed to indicate asweetness which had nothing to do with crime.\\n\\n 　　But deplorable as it might be, and undoubtedly was, there was another aspect of the case that more vitally concerned himself. Should he go to Biltz and convey to the Mrs. Alden of the letter the dreadful intelligence ofher daughter\u0027s death, at the same time inquiring about the character and whereabouts of the man who had beenwith her, or should he proceed first to District Attorney Mason\u0027s office in Bridgeburg and having imparted to himall of the details of the case, allow that gentleman to assume the painful responsibility of devastating a probablyutterly respectable home? For there was the political situation to be considered. And while he himself might actand so take personal credit, still there was this general party situation to be thought of. A strong man shouldundoubtedly head and so strengthen the party ticket this fall and here was the golden opportunity. The lattercourse seemed wiser. It would provide his friend, the district attorney, with his great chance. Arriving inBridgeburg in this mood, he ponderously invaded the office of Orville W. Mason, the district attorney, whoimmediately sat up, all attention, sensing something of import in the coroner\u0027s manner.\\n\\n 　　Mason was a short, broad-chested, broad-backed and vigorous individual physically, but in his late youth hadbeen so unfortunate as to have an otherwise pleasant and even arresting face marred by a broken nose, whichgave to him a most unprepossessing, almost sinister, look. Yet he was far from sinister. Rather, romantic andemotional. His boyhood had been one of poverty and neglect, causing him in his later and somewhat moresuccessful years to look on those with whom life had dealt more kindly as too favorably treated. The son of apoor farmer\u0027s widow, he had seen his mother put to such straits to make ends meet that by the time he reachedthe age of twelve he had surrendered nearly all of the pleasures of youth in order to assist her. And then, atfourteen, while skating, he had fallen and broken his nose in such a way as to forever disfigure his face.\\n\\n 　　Thereafter, feeling himself handicapped in the youthful sorting contests which gave to other boys the femalecompanions he most craved, he had grown exceedingly sensitive to the fact of his facial handicap. And this hadeventually resulted in what the Freudians are accustomed to describe as a psychic sex scar.\\n\\n 　　At the age of seventeen, however, he had succeeded in interesting the publisher and editor of the BridgeburgRepublican to the extent that he was eventually installed as official local news-gatherer of the town. Later hecame to be the Cataraqui County correspondent of such papers as the Albany Times-union and the Utica Star,ending eventually at the age of nineteen with the privilege of studying law in the office of one ex-Judge DavisRichofer, of Bridgeburg. And a few years later, after having been admitted to the bar, he had been taken up byseveral county politicians and merchants who saw to it that he was sent to the lower house of the state legislaturefor some six consecutive years, where, by reason of a modest and at the same time shrewd and ambitiouswillingness to do as he was instructed, he attained favor with those at the capital while at the same time retainingthe good will of his home-town sponsors. Later, returning to Bridgeburg and possessing some gifts of oratory, hewas given, first, the position of assistant district attorney for four years, and following that elected auditor, andsubsequently district attorney for two terms of four years each. Having acquired so high a position locally, hewas able to marry the daughter of a local druggist of some means, and two children had been born to them.\\n\\n 　　In regard to this particular case he had already heard from Miss Saunders all she knew of the drowning, and, likethe coroner, had been immediately impressed with the fact that the probable publicity attendant on such a case asthis appeared to be might be just what he needed to revive a wavering political prestige and might perhaps solvethe problem of his future. At any rate he was most intensely interested. So that now, upon sight of Heit, heshowed plainly the keen interest he felt in the case.\\n\\n 　　\"Well, Colonel Heit?\"\"Well, Orville, I\u0027m just back from Big Bittern. It looks to me as though I\u0027ve got a case for you now that\u0027s going totake quite a little of your time.\"Heit\u0027s large eyes bulged and conveyed hints of much more than was implied by his non-committal openingremark.\\n\\n 　　\"You mean that drowning up there?\" returned the district attorney.\\n\\n 　　\"Yes, sir. Just that,\" replied the coroner.\\n\\n 　　\"You\u0027ve some reason for thinking there\u0027s something wrong up there?\"\"Well, the truth is, Orville, I think there\u0027s hardly a doubt that this is a case of murder.\" Heit\u0027s heavy eyes glowedsomberly. \"Of course, it\u0027s best to be on the safe side, and I\u0027m only telling you this in confidence, because even yetI\u0027m not absolutely positive that that young man\u0027s body may not be in the lake. But it looks mighty suspicious tome, Orville. There\u0027s been at least fifteen men up there in row-boats all day yesterday and to-day, dragging thesouth part of that lake. I had a number of the boys take soundings here and there, and the water ain\u0027t more thantwenty-five feet deep at any point. But so far they haven\u0027t found any trace of him. They brought her up about oneo\u0027clock yesterday, after they\u0027d been only dragging a few hours, and a mighty pretty girl she is too, Orville--quiteyoung--not more than eighteen or twenty, I should say. But there are some very suspicious circumstances about itall that make me think that he ain\u0027t in there. In fact, I never saw a case that I thought looked more like a devilishcrime than this.\"As he said this, he began to search in the right-hand pocket of his well-worn and baggy linen suit and finallyextracted Roberta\u0027s letter, which he handed his friend, drawing up a chair and seating himself while the districtattorney proceeded to read.\\n\\n 　　\"Well, this does look rather suspicious, don\u0027t it?\" he announced, as he finished. \"You say they haven\u0027t found himyet. Well, have you communicated with this woman to see what she knows about it?\"\"No, Orville, I haven\u0027t,\" replied Heit, slowly and meditatively. \"And I\u0027ll tell you why. The fact is, I decided upthere last night that this was something I had better talk over with you before I did anything at all. You knowwhat the political situation here is just now. And how the proper handling of a case like this is likely to affectpublic opinion this fall. And while I certainly don\u0027t think we ought to mix politics in with crime there certainly isno reason why we shouldn\u0027t handle this in such a way as to make it count in our favor. And so I thought I hadbetter come and see you first. Of course, if you want me to, Orville, I\u0027ll go over there. Only I was thinking thatperhaps it would be better for you to go, and find out just who this fellow is and all about him. You know what acase like this might mean from a political point of view, if only we clean it up, and I know you\u0027re the one to do it,Orville.\"\"Thanks, Fred, thanks,\" replied Mason, solemnly, tapping his desk with the letter and squinting at his friend. \"I\u0027mgrateful to you for your opinion and you\u0027ve outlined the very best way to go about it, I think. You\u0027re sure no oneoutside yourself has seen this letter?\"\"Only the envelope. And no one but Mr. Hubbard, the proprietor of the inn up there, has seen that, and he toldme that he found it in her pocket and took charge of it for fear it might disappear or be opened before I got there.\\n\\n 　　He said he had a feeling there might be something wrong the moment he heard of the drowning. The young manhad acted so nervous--strange-like, he said.\"\"Very good, Fred. Then don\u0027t say anything more about it to any one for the present, will you? I\u0027ll go right overthere, of course. But what else did you find, anything?\" Mr. Mason was quite alive now, interrogative, dynamic,and a bit dictatorial in his manner, even to his old friend.\\n\\n 　　\"Plenty, plenty,\" replied the coroner, most sagely and solemnly. \"There were some suspicious cuts or marksunder the girl\u0027s right eye and above the left temple, Orville, and across the lip and nose, as though the poor littlething mighta been hit by something--a stone or a stick or one of those oars that they found floating up there.\\n\\n 　　She\u0027s just a child yet, Orville, in looks and size, anyhow--a very pretty girl--but not as good as she might havebeen, as I\u0027ll show you presently.\" At this point the coroner paused to extract a large handkerchief and blow into ita very loud blast, brushing his beard afterward in a most orderly way. \"I didn\u0027t have time to get a doctor up thereand besides I\u0027m going to hold the inquest down here, Monday, if I can. I\u0027ve ordered the Lutz boys to go up thereto-day and bring her body down. But the most suspicious of all the evidence that has come to light so far,Orville, is the testimony of two men and a boy who live up at Three Mile Bay and who were walking up to BigBittern on Thursday night to hunt and fish. I had Earl take down their names and subpoena \u0027em for the inquestnext Monday.\"And the coroner proceeded to detail their testimony about their accidental meeting of Clyde.\\n\\n 　　\"Well, well!\" interjected the district attorney, thoroughly interested.\\n\\n 　　\"Then, another thing, Orville,\" continued the coroner, \"I had Earl telephone the Three Mile Bay people, theowner of the hotel there as well as the postmaster and the town marshal, but the only person who appears to haveseen the young man is the captain of that little steamboat that runs from Three Mile Bay to Sharon. You knowthe man, I guess, Captain Mooney. I left word with Earl to subpoena him too. According to him, about eight-thirty, Friday morning, or just before his boat started for Sharon on its first trip, this same young man, or someone very much like the description furnished, carrying a suitcase and wearing a cap--he had on a straw hat whenthose three men met him--came on board and paid his way to Sharon and got off there. Good-looking youngchap, the captain says. Very spry and well-dressed, more like a young society man than anything else, and verystand-offish.\"\"Yes, yes,\" commented Mason.\\n\\n 　　\"I also had Earl telephone the people at Sharon--whoever he could reach--to see if he had been seen there gettingoff, but up to the time I left last night no one seemed to remember him. But I left word for Earl to telegraph adescription of him to all the resort hotels and stations hereabouts so that if he\u0027s anywhere around, they\u0027ll be on thelookout for him. I thought you\u0027d want me to do that. But I think you\u0027d better give me a writ for that bag at GunLodge station. That may contain something we ought to know. I\u0027ll go up and get it myself. Then I want to go toGrass Lake and Three Mile Bay and Sharon yet to-day, if I can, and see what else I can find. But I\u0027m afraid,Orville, it\u0027s a plain case of murder. The way he took that young girl to that hotel up there at Grass Lake and then registered under another name at Big Bittern, and the way he had her leave her bag and took his own with him!\"He shook his head most solemnly. \"Those are not the actions of an honest young man, Orville, and you know it.\\n\\n 　　What I can\u0027t understand is how her parents could let her go off like that anywhere with a man without knowingabout him in the first place.\"\"That\u0027s true,\" replied Mason, tactfully, but made intensely curious by the fact that it had at least been partiallyestablished that the girl in the case was not as good as she should have been. Adultery! And with some youth ofmeans, no doubt, from some one of the big cities to the south. The prominence and publicity with which his ownactivities in connection with this were very likely to be laden! At once he got up, energetically stirred. If he couldonly catch such a reptilian criminal, and that in the face of all the sentiment that such a brutal murder was likelyto inspire! The August convention and nominations. The fall election.\\n\\n 　　\"Well, I\u0027ll be switched,\" he exclaimed, the presence of Heit, a religious and conservative man, suppressinganything more emphatic. \"I do believe we\u0027re on the trail of something important, Fred. I really think so. It looksvery black to me--a most damnable outrage. I suppose the first thing to do, really, is to telephone over there andsee if there is such a family as Alden and exactly where they live. It\u0027s not more than fifty miles direct by car, ifthat much. Poor roads, though,\" he added. Then: \"That poor woman. I dread that scene. It will be a painful one, Iknow.\"Then he called Zillah and asked her to ascertain if there was such a person as Titus Alden living near Biltz. Also,exactly how to get there. Next he added: \"The first thing to do will be to get Burton back here\" (Burton beingBurton Burleigh, his legal assistant, who had gone away for a week-end vacation) \"and put him in charge so as tofurnish you whatever you need in the way of writs and so on, Fred, while I go right over to see this poor woman.\\n\\n 　　And then, if you\u0027ll have Earl go back up there and get that suitcase, I\u0027ll be most obliged to you. I\u0027ll bring thefather back with me, too, to identify the body. But don\u0027t say anything at all about this letter now or my going overthere until I see you later, see.\" He grasped the hand of his friend. \"In the meantime,\" he went on, a littlegrandiosely, now feeling the tang of great affairs upon him, \"I want to thank you, Fred. I certainly do, and I won\u0027tforget it, either. You know that, don\u0027t you?\" He looked his old friend squarely in the eye. \"This may turn outbetter than we think. It looks to be the biggest and most important case in all my term of office, and if we canonly clean it up satisfactorily and quickly, before things break here this fall, it may do us all some good, eh?\"\"Quite so, Orville, quite so,\" commented Fred Heit. \"Not, as I said before, that I think we ought to mix politics inwith a thing like this, but since it has come about so--\" he paused, meditatively.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16821.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
