{"id":1690,"no":82,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 16","content":"The result of all this, however, was that it was finally decided that perhaps the easiest and safest defense thatcould be made, assuming that the Griffiths family of Lycurgus would submit to it, would be that of insanity or\"brain storm\"--a temporary aberration due to love and an illusion of grandeur aroused in Clyde by SondraFinchley and the threatened disruption by Roberta of all his dreams and plans. But after consultation withCatchuman and Darrah Brookhart at Lycurgus, and these in turn conferring with Samuel and Gilbert Griffiths, itwas determined that this would not do. For to establish insanity or \"brain storm\" would require previous evidenceor testimony to the effect that Clyde was of none too sound mind, erratic his whole life long, and with certainspecific instances tending to demonstrate how really peculiar he was--relatives (among them the Griffiths ofLycurgus themselves, perhaps), coming on to swear to it--a line of evidence, which, requiring as it would,outright lying and perjury on the part of many as well as reflecting on the Griffiths\u0027 blood and brain, wassufficient to alienate both Samuel and Gilbert to the extent that they would have none of it. And so Brookhartwas compelled to assure Belknap that this line of defense would have to be abandoned. 　　Such being the case, both Belknap and Jephson were once more compelled to sit down and consider. For any other defense which either could think of now seemed positively hopeless. 　　\"I want to tell you one thing!\" observed the sturdy Jephson, after thumbing through the letters of both Robertaand Sondra again. \"These letters of this Alden girl are the toughest things we\u0027re going to have to face. They\u0027relikely to make any jury cry if they\u0027re read right, and then to introduce those letters from that other girl on top ofthese would be fatal. It will be better, I think, if we do not mention hers at all, unless he does. It will only make itlook as though he had killed that Alden girl to get rid of her. Mason couldn\u0027t want anything better, as I see it.\"And with this Belknap agreed most heartily. 　　At the same time, some plan must be devised immediately. And so, out of these various conferences, it wasfinally deduced by Jephson, who saw a great opportunity for himself in this matter, that the safest possibledefense that could be made, and one to which Clyde\u0027s own suspicious and most peculiar actions would mostexactly fit, would be that he had never contemplated murder. On the contrary, being a moral if not a physicalcoward, as his own story seemed to suggest, and in terror of being exposed and driven out of Lycurgus and of theheart of Sondra, and never as yet having told Roberta of Sondra and thinking that knowledge of this great lovefor her (Sondra) might influence Roberta to wish to be rid of him, he had hastily and without any worse plan inmind, decided to persuade Roberta to accompany him to any near-by resort but not especially Grass Lake or BigBittern, in order to tell her all this and so win his freedom--yet not without offering to pay her expenses as nearlyas he could during her very trying period. 　　\"All well and good,\" commented Belknap. \"But that involves his refusing to marry her, doesn\u0027t it? And what juryis going to sympathize with him for that or believe that he didn\u0027t want to kill her?\"\"Wait a minute, wait a minute,\" replied Jephson, a little testily. \"So far it does. Sure. But you haven\u0027t heard me tothe end yet. I said I had a plan.\"\"All right, then what is it?\" replied Belknap most interested. 　　\"Well, I\u0027ll tell you--my plan\u0027s this--to leave all the facts just as they are, and just as he tells them, and just asMason has discussed them so far, except, of course, his striking her--and then explain them--the letters, thewounds, the bag, the two hats, everything--not deny them in any way.\"And here he paused and ran his long, thin, freckled hands eagerly through his light hair and looked across thegrass of the public square to the jail where Clyde was, then toward Belknap again. 　　\"All very good, but how?\" queried Belknap. 　　\"There\u0027s no other way, I tell you,\" went on Jephson quite to himself, and ignoring his senior, \"and I think this willdo it.\" He turned to look out the window again, and began as though talking to some one outside: \"He goes upthere, you see, because he\u0027s frightened and because he has to do something or be exposed. And he signs thoseregisters just as he did because he\u0027s afraid to have it known by anybody down there in Lycurgus that he is upthere. And he has this plan about confessing to her about this other girl. BUT,\" and now he paused and lookedfixedly at Belknap, \"and this is the keystone of the whole thing--if this won\u0027t hold water, then down we go! 　　Listen! He goes up there with her, frightened, and not to marry her or to kill her but to argue with her to go away. 　　But once up there and he sees how sick she is, and tired, and sad-- well, you know how much she still loves him,and he spends two nights with her, see?\"\"Yes, I see,\" interrupted Belknap, curiously, but not quite so dubiously now. \"And that might explain thosenights.\"\"MIGHT? Would!\" replied Jephson, slyly and calmly, his harebell eyes showing only cold, eager, practical logic,no trace of emotion or even sympathy of any kind, really. \"Well, while he\u0027s up there with her under thoseconditions--so close to her again, you see\" (and his facial expression never altered so much as by a line) \"heexperiences a change of heart. You get me? He\u0027s sorry for her. He\u0027s ashamed of himself--his sin against her. Thatought to appeal to these fellows around here, these religious and moral people, oughtn\u0027t it?\"\"It might,\" quietly interpolated Belknap, who by now was very much interested and a little hopeful. 　　\"He sees that he\u0027s done her a wrong,\" continued Jephson, intent, like a spider spinning a web, on his own plan,\"and in spite of all his affection for this other girl, he\u0027s now ready to do the right thing by this Alden girl, do yousee, because he\u0027s sorry and ashamed of himself. That takes the black look off his plotting to kill her whilespending those two nights in Utica and Grass Lake with her.\"\"He still loves the other girl, though?\" interjected Belknap. 　　\"Well, sure. He likes her at any rate, has been fascinated by that life down there and sort of taken out of himself,made over into a different person, but now he\u0027s ready to marry Roberta, in case, after telling her all about thisother girl and his love for her, she still wants him to.\"\"I see. But how about the boat now and that bag and his going up to this Finchley girl\u0027s place afterwards?\"\"Just a minute! Just a minute! I\u0027ll tell you about that,\" continued Jephson, his blue eyes boring into space like apowerful electric ray. \"Of course, he goes out in the boat with her, and of course he takes that bag, and of coursehe signs those registers falsely, and walks away through those woods to that other girl, after Roberta is drowned. 　　But why? Why? Do you want to know why? I\u0027ll tell you! He felt sorry for her, see, and he wanted to marry her,or at least he wanted to do the right thing by her at the very last there. Not before, not before, remember, butAFTER he had spent a night with her in Utica and another one in Grass Lake. But once she was drowned--andaccidentally, of course, as he says, there was his love for that other girl. He hadn\u0027t ceased loving her even thoughhe was willing to sacrifice her in order to do the right thing by Roberta. See?\"\"I see.\"\"And how are they going to prove that he didn\u0027t experience a change of heart if he says he did and sticks to it?\"\"I see, but he\u0027ll have to tell a mighty convincing story,\" added Belknap, a little heavily. \"And how about thosetwo hats? They\u0027re going to have to be explained.\"\"Well, I\u0027m coming to those now. The one he had was a little soiled. And so he decided to buy another. As for that story he told Mason about wearing a cap, well, he was frightened and lied because he thought he would have toget out of it. Now, of course, before he goes to that other girl afterwards--while Roberta is still alive, I mean,there\u0027s his relationship with the other girl, what he intends to do about her. He\u0027s talking to Roberta, now you see,\"he continued, \"and that has to be disposed of in some way. But, as I see it, that\u0027s easy, for of course after heexperiences a change of heart and wants to do the right thing by Roberta, all he has to do is to write that othergirl or go to her and tell her-- about the wrong he has done Roberta.\"\"Yes.\"\"For, as I see it now, she can\u0027t be kept out of the case entirely, after all. We\u0027ll have to ring her in, I\u0027m afraid.\"\"All right; then we have to,\" said Belknap. 　　\"Because you see, if Roberta still feels that he ought to marry her--he\u0027ll go first and tell that Finchley girl that hecan\u0027t marry her--that he\u0027s going away--that is, if Roberta doesn\u0027t object to his leaving her that long, don\u0027t yousee?\"\"Yes.\"\"If she does, he\u0027ll marry her, either at Three Mile Bay or some other place.\"\"Yes.\"\"But you don\u0027t want to forget that while she\u0027s still alive he\u0027s puzzled and distressed. And it\u0027s only after thatsecond night, at Grass Lake, that he begins to see how wrong all his actions have been, you understand. 　　Something happens. Maybe she cries or talks about wanting to die, like she does in those letters.\"\"Yes.\"\"And so he wants a quiet place where they can sit down in peace and talk, where no one else will see or hearthem.\"\"Yes, yes--go on.\"\"Well, he thinks of Big Bittern. He\u0027s been up there once before or they\u0027re near there, then, and just below there,twelve miles, is Three Mile Bay, where, if they decide to marry, they can.\"\"I see.\"\"If not, if she doesn\u0027t want to marry him after his full confession, he can row her back to the inn, can\u0027t he, and heor she can stay there or go on.\"\"Yes, yes.\"\"In the meantime, not to have any delay or be compelled to hang about that inn--it\u0027s rather expensive, you know,and he hasn\u0027t any too much money--he takes that lunch in his bag. Also his camera, because he wants to takesome pictures. For if Mason should turn up with that camera, it\u0027s got to be explained, and it will be betterexplained by us than it will be by him, won\u0027t it?\"\"I see, I see,\" exclaimed Belknap, intensely interested by now and actually smiling and beginning to rub hishands. 　　\"So they go out on the lake.\"\"Yes.\"\"And they row around.\"\"Yes.\"\"And finally after lunch on shore, some pictures taken--\"\"Yes.\"\"He decides to tell her just how things stand with him. He\u0027s ready, willing--\"\"I get you.\"\"Only just before doing that, he wants to take one or two more pictures of her there in the boat, just off shore.\"\"Yes.\"\"And then he\u0027ll tell her, see?\"\"Yes.\"\"And so they go out in the boat again for a little row, just as he did, see?\"\"Yes.\"\"But because they intend to go ashore again for some flowers, he\u0027s left the bag there, see? That explains the bag.\"\"Yes.\"\"But before taking any more pictures there, in the boat on the water, he begins to tell her about his love for thisother girl--that if she wants him to, now he\u0027ll marry her and then write this Sondra a letter. Or, if she feels shedoesn\u0027t want to marry him with him loving this other girl . . .\"\"Yes, go on!\" interrupted Belknap, eagerly. 　　\"Well,\" continued Jephson, \"he\u0027ll do his best to take care of her and support her out of the money he\u0027ll have afterhe marries the rich girl.\"\"Yes.\"\"Well, she wants him to marry her and drop this Miss Finchley!\"\"I see.\"\"And he agrees?\"\"Sure.\"\"Also she\u0027s so grateful that in her excitement, or gratitude, she jumps up to come toward him, you see?\"\"Yes.\"\"And the boat rocks a little, and he jumps up to help her because he\u0027s afraid she\u0027s going to fall, see?\"\"Yes, I see.\"\"Well, now if we wanted to we could have him have that camera of his in his hand or not, just as you think fit.\"\"Yes, I see what you\u0027re driving at.\"\"Well, whether he keeps it in his hand or doesn\u0027t, there\u0027s some misstep on his part or hers, just as he says, or justthe motion of the two bodies, causes the boat to go over, and he strikes her, or not, just as you think fit, butaccidentally, of course.\"\"Yes, I see, and I\u0027ll be damned!\" exclaimed Belknap. \"Fine, Reuben! Excellent! Wonderful, really!\"\"And the boat strikes her too, as well as him, a little, see?\" went on Jephson, paying no attention to this outburst,so interested was he in his own plot, \"and makes him a little dizzy, too.\"\"I see.\"\"And he hears her cries and sees her, but he\u0027s a little stunned himself, see? And by the time he\u0027s ready to dosomething--\"\"She\u0027s gone,\" concluded Belknap, quietly. \"Drowned. I get you.\"\"And then, because of all those other suspicious circumstances and false registrations--and because now she\u0027s gone and he can\u0027t do anything more for her, anyhow--her relatives might not want to know her condition, youknow--\"\"I see.\"\"He slips away, frightened, a moral coward, just as we\u0027ll have to contend from the first, anxious to stand wellwith his uncle and not lose his place in this world. Doesn\u0027t that explain it?\"\"About as well as anything could explain it, Reuben, I think. In fact, I think it\u0027s a plausible explanation and Icongratulate you. I don\u0027t see how any one could hope to find a better. If that doesn\u0027t get him off, or bring about adisagreement, at least we might get him off with, well, say, twenty years, don\u0027t you think?\" And very muchcheered, he got up, and after eyeing his long, thin associate admiringly, added: \"Fine!\" while Jephson, his blueeyes for all the world like windless, still pools, looked steadily back. 　　\"But of course you know what that means?\" Jephson now added, calmly and softly. 　　\"That we have to put him on the witness stand? Surely, surely. I see that well enough. But it\u0027s his only chance.\"\"And he won\u0027t strike people as a very steady or convincing fellow, I\u0027m afraid--too nervous and emotional.\"\"Yes, I know all that,\" replied Belknap, quickly. \"He\u0027s easily rattled. And Mason will go after him like a wildbull. But we\u0027ll have to coach him as to all this--drill him. Make him understand that it\u0027s his only chance--that hisvery life depends on it. Drill him for months.\"\"If he fails, then he\u0027s gone. If only we could do something to give him courage--teach him to act it out.\"Jephson\u0027s eyes seemed to be gazing directly before him at the very courtroom scene in which Clyde on the standwould have Mason before him. And then picking up Roberta\u0027s letters (copies of them furnished by Mason) andlooking at them, he concluded: \"If it only weren\u0027t for these--here.\" He weighed them up and down in his hand.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815/16834.html","bookId":55,"book":{"id":55,"title":"An American Tragedy 美国悲剧","description":"简介： 德莱塞在《美国悲剧》中描写了主人公克莱德格里菲思受到社会上邪恶影响，逐渐蜕变、堕落为凶杀犯、最后自我毁灭的全过程。小说共分三卷。第一卷描写克莱德这个天真幼稚的青年...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
