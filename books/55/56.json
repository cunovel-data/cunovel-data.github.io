{"id":1664,"no":56,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 37","content":"The information thus gained was a relief, but only partially so. For both Clyde and Roberta there was no realrelief now until this problem should be definitely solved. And although within a few moments after he hadobtained it, he appeared and explained that at last he had secured the name of some one who might help her, stillthere was yet the serious business of heartening her for the task of seeing the doctor alone, also for the story thatwas to exculpate him and at the same time win for her sufficient sympathy to cause the doctor to make the chargefor his service merely nominal. 　　But now, instead of protesting as at first he feared that she might, Roberta was moved to acquiesce. So manythings in Clyde\u0027s attitude since Christmas had so shocked her that she was bewildered and without a plan otherthan to extricate herself as best she might without any scandal attaching to her or him and then going her ownway--pathetic and abrasive though it might be. For since he did not appear to care for her any more and plainlydesired to be rid of her, she was in no mood to compel him to do other than he wished. Let him go. She couldmake her own way. She had, and she could too, without him, if only she could get out of this. Yet, as she saidthis to herself, however, and a sense of the full significance of it all came to her, the happy days that would neverbe again, she put her hands to her eyes and brushed away uncontrollable tears. To think that all that was shouldcome to this. 　　Yet when he called the same evening after visiting Short, his manner redolent of a fairly worth-whileachievement, she merely said, after listening to his explanation in as receptive a manner as she could: \"Do youknow just where this is, Clyde? Can we get there on the car without much trouble, or will we have to walk a longway?\" And after he had explained that it was but a little way out of Gloversville, in the suburbs really, aninterurban stop being but a quarter of a mile from the house, she had added: \"Is he home at night, or will we haveto go in the daytime? It would be so much better if we could go at night. There\u0027d be so much less danger of anyone seeing us.\" And being assured that he was, as Clyde had learned from Short, she went on: \"But do you knowis he old or young? I\u0027d feel so much easier and safer if he were old. I don\u0027t like young doctors. We\u0027ve always hadan old doctor up home and I feel so much easier talking to some one like him.\"Clyde did not know. He had not thought to inquire, but to reassure her he ventured that he was middle-aged-whichchanced to be the fact. 　　The following evening the two of them departed, but separately as usual, for Fonda, where it was necessary to change cars. And once within the approximate precincts of the physician\u0027s residence, they stepped down andmade their way along a road, which in this mid-state winter weather was still covered with old and dry-packedsnow. It offered a comparatively smooth floor for their quick steps. For in these days, there was no longer thatlingering intimacy which formerly would have characterized both. In those other and so recent days, as Robertawas constantly thinking, he would have been only too glad in such a place as this, if not on such an occasion, todrag his steps, put an arm about her waist, and talk about nothing at all--the night, the work at the factory, Mr. 　　Liggett, his uncle, the current movies, some place they were planning to go, something they would love to dotogether if they could. But now . . . And on this particular occasion, when most of all, and if ever, she needed thefull strength of his devotion and support! Yet now, as she could see, he was most nervously concerned as towhether, going alone in this way, she was going to get scared and \"back out\"; whether she was going to think tosay the right thing at the right time and convince the doctor that he must do something for her, and for a nominalfee. 　　\"Well, Bert, how about you? All right? You\u0027re not going to get cold feet now, are you? Gee, I hope not becausethis is going to be a good chance to get this thing done and over with. And it isn\u0027t like you were going to someone who hadn\u0027t done anything like this before, you know, because this fellow has. I got that straight. All youhave to do now, is to say, well, you know, that you\u0027re in trouble, see, and that you don\u0027t know how you\u0027re goingto get out of it unless he\u0027ll help you in some way, because you haven\u0027t any friends here you can go to. Andbesides, as things are, you couldn\u0027t go to \u0027em if you wanted to. They\u0027d tell on you, see. Then if he asks where Iam or who I am, you just say that I was a fellow here--but that I\u0027ve gone--give any name you want to, but thatI\u0027ve gone, and you don\u0027t know where I\u0027ve gone to--run away, see. Then you\u0027d better say, too, that you wouldn\u0027thave come to him only that you heard of another case in which he helped some one else--that a girl told you, see. 　　Only you don\u0027t want to let on that you\u0027re paid much, I mean,--because if you do he may want to make the billmore than I can pay, see, unless he\u0027ll give us a few months in which to do it, or something like that, you see.\"Clyde was so nervous and so full of the necessity of charging Roberta with sufficient energy and courage to gothrough with this and succeed, now that he had brought her this far along with it, that he scarcely realized howinadequate and trivial, even, in so far as her predicament and the doctor\u0027s mood and temperament wereconcerned, his various instructions and bits of inexperienced advice were. And she on her part was not onlythinking how easy it was for him to stand back and make suggestions, while she was confronted with thenecessity of going forward, and that alone, but also that he was really thinking more of himself than he was ofher--some way to make her get herself out of it inexpensively and without any real trouble to him. 　　At the same time, even here and now, in spite of all this, she was still decidedly drawn to him--his white face, histhin hands, nervous manner. And although she knew he talked to encourage her to do what he had not thecourage or skill to do himself, she was not angry. Rather, she was merely saying to herself in this crisis thatalthough he advised so freely she was not going to pay attention to him--much. What she was going to say wasnot that she was deserted, for that seemed too much of a disagreeable and self-incriminating remark for her tomake concerning herself, but rather that she was married and that she and her young husband were too poor tohave a baby as yet--the same story Clyde had told the druggist in Schenectady, as she recalled. For after all, whatdid he know about how she felt? And he was not going with her to make it easier for her. 　　Yet dominated by the purely feminine instinct to cling to some one for support, she now turned to Clyde, takinghold of his hands and standing quite still, wishing that he would hold and pet her and tell her that it was all right and that she must not be afraid. And although he no longer cared for her, now in the face of this involuntaryevidence of her former trust in him, he released both hands and putting his arms about her, the more to encourageher than anything else, observed: \"Come on now, Bert. Gee, you can\u0027t act like this, you know. You don\u0027t want tolose your nerve now that we\u0027re here, do you? It won\u0027t be so hard once you get there. I know it won\u0027t. All you gotto do is to go up and ring the bell, see, and when he comes, or whoever comes, just say you want to see thedoctor alone, see. Then he\u0027ll understand it\u0027s something private and it\u0027ll be easier.\"He went on with more advice of the same kind, and she, realizing from his lack of spontaneous enthusiasm forher at this moment how desperate was her state, drew herself together as vigorously as she could, and saying: 　　\"Well, wait here, then, will you? Don\u0027t go very far away, will you? I may be right back,\" hurried along in theshadow through the gate and up a walk which led to the front door. 　　In answer to her ring the door was opened by one of those exteriorly as well as mentally sober, small-townpractitioners who, Clyde\u0027s and Short\u0027s notion to the contrary notwithstanding, was the typical and fairlyconservative physician of the countryside--solemn, cautious, moral, semi-religious to a degree, holding someviews which he considered liberal and others which a fairly liberal person would have considered narrow andstubborn into the bargain. Yet because of the ignorance and stupidity of so many of those about him, he was ableto consider himself at least fairly learned. In constant touch with all phases of ignorance and dereliction as wellas sobriety, energy, conservatism, success and the like, he was more inclined, where fact appeared to nullify hisearly conclusion in regard to many things, to suspend judgment between the alleged claims of heaven and helland leave it there suspended and undisturbed. Physically he was short, stocky, bullet-headed and yetinterestingly-featured, with quick gray eyes and a pleasant mouth and smile. His short iron-gray hair was worn\"bangs\" fashion, a bit of rural vanity. And his arms and hands, the latter fat and pudgy, yet sensitive, hung limplyat his sides. He was fifty-eight, married, the father of three children, one of them a son already studying medicinein order to succeed to his father\u0027s practice. 　　After showing Roberta into a littered and commonplace waiting room and asking her to remain until he hadfinished his dinner, he presently appeared in the door of an equally commonplace inner room, or office, wherewere his desk, two chairs, some medical instruments, books and apparently an ante-chamber containing othermedical things, and motioned her to a chair. And because of his grayness, solidity, stolidity, as well as an oddhabit he had of blinking his eyes, Roberta was not a little overawed, though by no means so unfavorablyimpressed as she had feared she might be. At least he was old and he seemed intelligent and conservative, if notexactly sympathetic or warm in his manner. And after looking at her curiously a moment, as though seeking torecognize some one of the immediate vicinity, he began: \"Well, now who is this, please? And what can I do foryou?\" His voice was low and quite reassuring--a fact for which Roberta was deeply grateful. 　　At the same time, startled by the fact that at last she had reached the place and the moment when, if ever, shemust say the degrading truth about herself, she merely sat there, her eyes first upon him, then upon the floor, herfingers beginning to toy with the handle of the small bag she carried. 　　\"You see, well,\" she began, earnestly and nervously, her whole manner suddenly betraying the terrific strainunder which she was laboring. \"I came . . . I came . . . that is . . . I don\u0027t know whether I can tell you about myselfor not. I thought I could just before I came in, but now that I am here and I see you . . .\" She paused and movedback in her chair as though to rise, at the same time that she added: \"Oh, dear, how very dreadful it all is. I\u0027m so nervous and . . .\"\"Well, now, my dear,\" he resumed, pleasantly and reassuringly, impressed by her attractive and yet soberappearance and wondering for the moment what could have upset so clean, modest and sedate-looking a girl,and hence not a little amused by her \"now that I see you,\"--\"Just what is there about me \u0027now that you see me,\u0027\"he repeated after her, \"that so frightens you? I am only a country doctor, you know, and I hope I\u0027m not asdreadful as you seem to think. You can be sure that you can tell me anything you wish--anything at all aboutyourself--and you needn\u0027t be afraid. If there\u0027s anything I can do for you, I\u0027ll do it.\"He was decidedly pleasant, as she now thought, and yet so sober and reserved and probably conventional withalthat what she was holding in mind to tell him would probably shock him not a little--and then what? Would hedo anything for her? And if he would, how was she to arrange about money, for that certainly would be a point inconnection with all this? If only Clyde or some one were here to speak for her. And yet she must speak now thatshe was here. She could not leave without. Once more she moved and twisted, seizing nervously on a largebutton of her coat to turn between her thumb and forefinger, and then went on chokingly. 　　\"But this is . . . this is . . . well, something different, you know, maybe not what you think. . . . I . . . I . . . 　　well. . .\"Again she paused, unable to proceed, shading from white to red and back as she spoke. And because of thetroubled modesty of her approach, as well as a certain clarity of eye, whiteness of forehead, sobriety of mannerand dress, the doctor could scarcely bring himself to think for a moment that this was anything other than one ofthose morbid exhibitions of innocence, or rather inexperience, in connection with everything relating to thehuman body--so characteristic of the young and unsophisticated in some instances. And so he was about torepeat his customary formula in such cases that all could be told to him without fear or hesitation, whatever itmight be, when a secondary thought, based on Roberta\u0027s charm and vigor, as well as her own thought wavesattacking his cerebral receptive centers, caused him to decide that he might be wrong. After all, why might notthis be another of those troublesome youthful cases in which possibly immorality and illegitimacy was involved. 　　She was so young, healthy and attractive, besides, they were always cropping up, these cases,--in connectionwith the most respectable-looking girls at times. And invariably they spelled trouble and distress for doctors. 　　And, for various reasons connected with his own temperament, which was retiring and recessive, as well as thenature of this local social world, he disliked and hesitated to even trifle with them. They were illegal, dangerous,involved little or no pay as a rule, and the sentiment of this local world was all against them as he knew. Besideshe personally was more or less irritated by these young scamps of boys and girls who were so free to exercise thenormal functions of their natures in the first instance, but so ready to refuse the social obligations which wentwith them--marriage afterwards. And so, although in several cases in the past ten years where family and otherneighborhood and religious considerations had made it seem quite advisable, he had assisted in extricating fromthe consequences of their folly several young girls of good family who had fallen from grace and could nototherwise be rescued, still he was opposed to aiding, either by his own countenance or skill, any lapses or tanglesnot heavily sponsored by others. It was too dangerous. Ordinarily it was his custom to advise immediate andunconditional marriage. Or, where that was not possible, the perpetrator of the infamy having decamped, it washis general and self-consciously sanctioned practice to have nothing at all to do with the matter. It was toodangerous and ethically and socially wrong and criminal into the bargain. 　　In consequence he now looked at Roberta in an extremely sober manner. By no means, he now said to himself,must he allow himself to become emotionally or otherwise involved here. And so in order to help himself as wellas her to attain and maintain a balance which would permit of both extricating themselves without too muchtrouble, he drew toward him his black leather case record book and, opening it, said: \"Now, let\u0027s see if we can\u0027tfind out what the trouble is here. What is your name?\"\"Ruth Howard. Mrs. Howard,\" replied Roberta nervously and tensely, at once fixing upon a name which Clydehad suggested for her use. And now, interestingly enough, at mention of the fact that she was married, hebreathed easier. But why the tears then? What reason could a young married woman have for being so intenselyshy and nervous? 　　\"And your husband\u0027s first name?\" he went on. 　　As simple as the question was, and as easy as it should have been to answer, Roberta nevertheless hesitatedbefore she could bring herself to say: \"Gifford,\" her older brother\u0027s name. 　　\"You live around her, I presume?\"\"In Fonda.\"\"Yes. And how old are you?\"\"Twenty-two.\"\"How long have you been married?\"This inquiry being so intimately connected with the problem before her, she again hesitated before saying, \"Letme see--three months.\"At once Dr. Glenn became dubious again, though he gave her no sign. Her hesitancy arrested him. Why theuncertainty? He was wondering now again whether he was dealing with a truthful girl or whether his firstsuspicions were being substantiated. In consequence he now asked: \"Well, now what seems to be the trouble,Mrs. Howard? You need have no hesitancy in telling me--none whatsoever. I am used to such things year in andout, whatever they are. That is my business, listening to the troubles of people.\"\"Well,\" began Roberta, nervously once more, this terrible confession drying her throat and thickening her tonguealmost, while once more she turned the same button of her coat and gazed at the floor. \"It\u0027s like this . . . You see . 　　. . my husband hasn\u0027t much money . . . and I have to work to help out with expenses and neither of us make sovery much.\" (She was astonishing herself with her own shameful power to lie in this instance--she, who hadalways hated to lie.) \"So . . . of course . . . we can\u0027t afford to . . . to have . . . well, any . . . children, you see, sosoon, anyhow, and . . .\"She paused, her breath catching, and really unable to proceed further with this wholesale lying. 　　The doctor realizing from this, as he thought, what the true problem was--that she was a newly-married girl whowas probably faced by just such a problem as she was attempting to outline--yet not wishing to enter upon anyform of malpractice and at the same time not wishing to appear too discouraging to a young couple just startingout in life, gazed at her somewhat more sympathetically, the decidedly unfortunate predicament of these youngpeople, as well as her appropriate modesty in the face of such a conventionally delicate situation, appealing tohim. It was too bad. Young people these days did have a rather hard time of it, getting started in some cases,anyhow. And they were no doubt faced by some pressing financial situations. Nearly all young people were. 　　Nevertheless, this business of a contraceptal operation or interference with the normal or God-arranged lifeprocesses, well, that was a ticklish and unnatural business at best which he wanted as little as possible to do with. 　　Besides, young, healthy people, even though poor, when they undertook marriage, knew what they were about. 　　And it was not impossible for them to work, the husband anyhow, and hence manage in some way. 　　And now straightening himself around in his chair very soberly and authoritatively, he began: \"I think Iunderstand what you want to say to me, Mrs. Howard. But I\u0027m also wondering if you have considered what avery serious and dangerous thing it is you have in mind. But,\" he added, suddenly, another thought as to whetherhis own reputation in this community was in any way being tarnished by rumor of anything he had done in thepast coming to him, \"just how did you happen to come to me, anyhow?\"Something about the tone of his voice, the manner in which he asked the question--the caution of it as well as thepossibly impending resentment in case it should turn out that any one suspected him of a practice of this sort-causedRoberta to hesitate and to feel that any statement to the effect that she had heard of or been sent by anyone else--Clyde to the contrary notwithstanding--might be dangerous. Perhaps she had better not say that she hadbeen sent by any one. He might resent it as an insult to his character as a reputable physician. A budding instinctfor diplomacy helped her in this instance, and she replied: \"I\u0027ve noticed your sign in passing several times andI\u0027ve heard different people say you were a good doctor.\"His uncertainty allayed, he now continued: \"In the first place, the thing you want done is something myconscience would not permit me to advise. I understand, of course, that you consider it necessary. You and yourhusband are both young and you probably haven\u0027t very much money to go on, and you both feel that aninterruption of this kind will be a great strain in every way. And no doubt it will be. Still, as I see it, marriage is avery sacred thing, and children are a blessing--not a curse. And when you went to the altar three months ago youwere probably not unaware that you might have to face just such a situation as this. All young married peopleare, I think.\" (\"The altar,\" thought Roberta sadly. If only it were so.) \"Now I know that the tendency of the day insome quarters is very much in this direction, I am sorry to say. There are those who feel it quite all right if theycan shirk the normal responsibilities in such cases as to perform these operations, but it\u0027s very dangerous, Mrs. 　　Howard, very dangerous legally and ethically as well as medically very wrong. Many women who seek to escapechildbirth die in this way. Besides it is a prison offense for any doctor to assist them, whether there are badconsequences or not. You know that, I suppose. At any rate, I, for one, am heartily opposed to this sort of thingfrom every point of view. The only excuse I have ever been able to see for it is when the life of the mother, forinstance, depends upon such an operation. Not otherwise. And in such cases the medical profession is in accord. 　　But in this instance I\u0027m sure the situation isn\u0027t one which warrants anything like that. You seem to me to be astrong, healthy girl. Motherhood should hold no serious consequences for you. And as for money reasons, don\u0027tyou really think now that if you just go ahead and have this baby, you and your husband would find means ofgetting along? You say your husband is an electrician?\"\"Yes,\" replied Roberta, nervously, not a little overawed and subdued by his solemn moralizing. 　　\"Well, now, there you are,\" he went on. \"That\u0027s not such an unprofitable profession. At least all electricianscharge enough. And when you consider, as you must, how serious a thing you are thinking of doing, that you areactually planning to destroy a young life that has as good a right to its existence as you have to yours . . .\" hepaused in order to let the substance of what he was saying sink in--\"well, then, I think you might feel called uponto stop and consider--both you and your husband. Besides,\" he added, in a diplomatic and more fatherly and evenintriguing tone of voice, \"I think that once you have it it will more than make up to you both for whatever littlehardship its coming will bring you. Tell me,\" he added curiously at this point, \"does your husband know of this? 　　Or is this just some plan of yours to save him and yourself from too much hardship?\" He almost beamedcheerfully as, fancying he had captured Roberta in some purely nervous and feminine economy as well as dread,he decided that if so he could easily extract her from her present mood. And she, sensing his present drift andfeeling that one lie more or less could neither help nor harm her, replied quickly: \"He knows.\"\"Well, then,\" he went on, slightly reduced by the fact that his surmise was incorrect, but none the less resolved todissuade her and him, too: \"I think you two should really consider very seriously before you go further in thismatter. I know when young people first face a situation like this they always look on the darkest side of it, but itdoesn\u0027t always work out that way. I know my wife and I did with our first child. But we got along. And if youwill only stop now and talk it over, you\u0027ll see it in a different light, I\u0027m sure. And then you won\u0027t have yourconscience to deal with afterwards, either.\" He ceased, feeling reasonably sure that he had dispelled the fear, aswell as the determination that had brought Roberta to him--that, being a sensible, ordinary wife, she would nowdesist of course--think nothing more of her plan and leave. 　　But instead of either acquiescing cheerfully or rising to go, as he thought she might, she gave him a wide-eyedterrified look and then as instantly burst into tears. For the total effect of his address had been to first revive moreclearly than ever the normal social or conventional aspect of the situation which all along she was attempting toshut out from her thoughts and which, under ordinary circumstances, assuming that she was really married, wasexactly the attitude she would have taken. But now the realization that her problem was not to be solved at all, bythis man at least, caused her to be seized with what might best be described as morbid panic. 　　Suddenly beginning to open and shut her fingers and at the same time beating her knees, while her face contorteditself with pain and terror, she exclaimed: \"But you don\u0027t understand, doctor, you don\u0027t understand! I HAVE toget out of this in some way! I have to. It isn\u0027t like I told you at all. I\u0027m not married. I haven\u0027t any husband at all. 　　But, oh, you don\u0027t know what this means to me. My family! My father! My mother! I can\u0027t tell you. But I mustget out of it. I must! I must! Oh, you don\u0027t know, you don\u0027t know! I must! I must!\" She began to rock backwardand forward, at the same time swaying from side to side as in a trance. 　　And Glenn, surprised and startled by this sudden demonstration as well as emotionally affected, and yet at thesame time advised thereby that his original surmise had been correct, and hence that Roberta had been lying, aswell as that if he wished to keep himself out of this he must now assume a firm and even heartless attitude, askedsolemnly: \"You are not married, you say?\"For answer now Roberta merely shook her head negatively and continued to cry. And at last gathering the full import of her situation, Dr. Glenn got up, his face a study of troubled and yet conservative caution and sympathy. 　　But without saying anything at first he merely looked at her as she wept. Later he added: \"Well, well, this is toobad. I\u0027m sorry.\" But fearing to commit himself in any way, he merely paused, adding after a time soothingly anddubiously: \"You mustn\u0027t cry. That won\u0027t help you any.\" He then paused again, still determined not to haveanything to do with this case. Yet a bit curious as to the true nature of the story he finally asked: \"Well, thenwhere is the young man who is the cause of your trouble? Is he here?\"Still too overcome by shame and despair to speak, Roberta merely shook her head negatively. 　　\"But he knows that you\u0027re in trouble, doesn\u0027t he?\"\"Yes,\" replied Roberta faintly. 　　\"And he won\u0027t marry you?\"\"He\u0027s gone away.\"\"Oh, I see. The young scamp! And don\u0027t you know where he\u0027s gone?\"\"No,\" lied Roberta, weakly. 　　\"How long has it been since he left you?\"\"About a week now.\" Once more she lied. 　　\"And you don\u0027t know where he is?\"\"No.\"\"How long has it been since you were sick?\"\"Over two weeks now,\" sobbed Roberta. 　　\"And before that you have always been regular?\"\"Yes.\"\"Well, in the first place,\" his tone was more comfortable and pleasant than before--he seemed to be snatching at aplausible excuse for extricating himself from a case which promised little other than danger and difficulty, \"thismay not be as serious as you think. I know you\u0027re probably very much frightened, but it\u0027s not unusual for womento miss a period. At any rate, without an examination it wouldn\u0027t be possible to be sure, and even if you were, themost advisable thing would be to wait another two weeks. You may find then that there is nothing wrong. Iwouldn\u0027t be surprised if you did. You seem to be oversensitive and nervous and that sometimes brings aboutdelays of this kind--mere nervousness. At any rate, if you\u0027ll take my advice, whatever you do, you\u0027ll not do anything now but just go home and wait until you\u0027re really sure. For even if anything were to be done, it wouldn\u0027tbe advisable for you to do anything before then.\"\"But I\u0027ve already taken some pills and they haven\u0027t helped me,\" pleaded Roberta. 　　\"What were they?\" asked Glenn interestedly, and, after he had learned, merely commented: \"Oh, those. Well,they wouldn\u0027t be likely to be of any real service to you, if you were pregnant. But I still suggest that you wait,and if you find you pass your second period, then it will be time enough to act, although I earnestly advise you,even then, to do nothing if you can help it, because I consider it wrong to interfere with nature in this way. Itwould be much better, if you would arrange to have the child and take care of it. Then you wouldn\u0027t have theadditional sin of destroying a life upon your conscience.\"He was very grave and felt very righteous as he said this. But Roberta, faced by terrors which he did not appearto be able to grasp, merely exclaimed, and as dramatically as before: \"But I can\u0027t do that, doctor, I tell you! Ican\u0027t. I can\u0027t! You don\u0027t understand. Oh, I don\u0027t know what I shall do unless I find some way out of this. I don\u0027t! Idon\u0027t! I don\u0027t!\"She shook her head and clenched her fingers and rocked to and fro while Glenn, impressed by her own terrors,the pity of the folly which, as he saw it, had led her to this dreadful pass, yet professionally alienated by a type ofcase that spelled nothing but difficulty for him stood determinedly before her and added: \"As I told you before,Miss--\" (he paused) \"Howard, if that is your name, I am seriously opposed to operations of this kind, just as I amto the folly that brings girls and young men to the point where they seem to think they are necessary. A physicianmay not interfere in a case of this kind unless he is willing to spend ten years in prison, and I think that law is fairenough. Not that I don\u0027t realize how painful your present situation appears to you. But there are always thosewho are willing to help a girl in your state, providing she doesn\u0027t wish to do something which is morally andlegally wrong. And so the very best advice I can give you now is that you do nothing at all now or at any time. 　　Better go home and see your parents and confess. It will be much better--much better, I assure you. Not nearly ashard as you think or as wicked as this other way. Don\u0027t forget there is a life there--a human--if it is really as youthink. A human life which you are seeking to end and that I cannot help you to do. I really cannot. There may bedoctors--I know there are--men here and there who take their professional ethics a little less seriously than I do;but I cannot let myself become one of them. I am sorry--very. 　　\"So now the best I can say is--go home to your parents and tell them. It may look hard now but you are going tofeel better about it in the long run. If it will make you or them feel any better about it, let them come and talk tome. I will try and make them see that this is not the worst thing in the world, either. But as for doing what youwant--I am very, very sorry, but I cannot. My conscience will not permit me.\"He paused and gazed at her sympathetically, yet with a determined and concluded look in his eye.
