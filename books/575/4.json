{"id":29426,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER 3","content":"Mouret spent the whole of the next morning in playing the spy on his new tenant. This espionage would now enable him to fill up the idle hours which he had hitherto spent in pottering about the house, in putting back into their proper places any articles which he happened to find lying about, and in picking quarrels with his wife and children. Henceforth he would have an occupation, an amusement which would relieve the monotony of his everyday life. As he had often said, he was not partial to priests, and yet Abbé Faujas, the first one who had entered into his existence, excited in him an extraordinary amount of interest. This priest brought with him a touch of mystery and secrecy that was almost disquieting. Although Mouret was a strong-minded man and professed himself to be a follower of Voltaire, yet in the Abbé\u0027s presence he felt the astonishment and uneasiness of a common bourgeois. Not a sound came from the second floor. Mouret stood on the staircase and listened eagerly; he even ventured to go to the loft. As he hushed his steps while passing along the passage, a pattering of slippers behind the door filled him with emotion. But he did not succeed in making any new discovery, so he went down into the garden and strolled into the arbour at the end of it, there raising his eyes and trying to[Pg 20] look through the windows in order to find out what might be going on in the rooms. But he could not see even the Abbé\u0027s shadow. Madame Faujas, in the absence of curtains, had, as a makeshift, fastened some sheets behind the windows. At lunch Mouret seemed quite vexed. \u0027Are they dead upstairs?\u0027 he said, as he cut the children\u0027s bread. \u0027Have you heard them move, Marthe?\u0027 \u0027No, my dear; but I haven\u0027t been listening.\u0027 Rose thereupon cried out from the kitchen: \u0027They\u0027ve been gone ever so long. They must be far enough away now if they\u0027ve kept on at the same pace.\u0027 Mouret summoned the cook and questioned her minutely. \u0027They went out, sir: first the mother, and then the priest. They walked so softly that I should never have known anything about it if their shadows had not fallen across the kitchen floor when they opened the street door. I looked out into the street to see where they were going, but they had vanished. They must have gone off in a fine hurry.\u0027 \u0027It is very surprising. But where was I at the time?\u0027 \u0027I think you were in the garden, sir, looking at the grapes in the arbour.\u0027 This put Mouret into a very bad temper. He began to inveigh against priests. They were a set of mystery-mongers, a parcel of underhand schemers, with whom the devil himself would be at a loss. They affected such ridiculous prudery that no one had ever seen a priest wash his face. And then he wound up by expressing his sorrow that he had ever let his rooms to this Abbé, about whom he knew nothing at all. \u0027It is all your fault!\u0027 he exclaimed to his wife, as he got up from table. Marthe was about to protest and remind him of their discussion on the previous day, but she raised her eyes and simply looked at him, saying nothing. Mouret, contrary to his usual custom, resolved to remain at home. He pottered up and down between the dining-room and the garden, poking about everywhere, pretending that nothing was in its place and that the house simply invited thieves. Then he got indignant with Serge and Octave, who had set off for the college, he said, quite half an hour too soon. \u0027Isn\u0027t father going out?\u0027 Désirée whispered in her mother\u0027s ear. \u0027He will worry us to death if he stays at home.\u0027 [Pg 21] Marthe hushed her. At last Mouret began to speak of a piece of business which he declared he must finish off during the day. And then he complained that he had never a moment to himself, and could never get a day\u0027s rest at home when he felt he wanted it. Finally he went away, quite distressed that he could not remain and see what happened. When he returned in the evening he was all on fire with curiosity. \u0027Well, what about the Abbé?\u0027 he asked, without even giving himself time to take off his hat. Marthe was working in her usual place on the terrace. \u0027The Abbé!\u0027 she repeated, with an appearance of surprise. \u0027Oh, yes! the Abbé—I\u0027ve really seen nothing of him, but I believe he has got settled down now. Rose told me that some furniture had come.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s just what I was afraid of!\u0027 exclaimed Mouret. \u0027I wanted to be here when it came; for, you see, the furniture is my security. I knew very well that you would never think of stirring from your chair. You haven\u0027t much of a head, my dear—Rose! Rose!\u0027 The cook appeared in answer to his summons, and he forthwith asked her: \u0027There\u0027s some furniture come for the people on the second floor?\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir; it came in a little covered cart. I recognised it as Bergasse\u0027s; the second-hand dealer\u0027s. It wasn\u0027t a big load. Madame Faujas came on behind it. I dare say she had been giving the man who pushed it along a helping hand up the Rue Balande.\u0027 \u0027At any rate, you saw the furniture, I suppose? Did you notice what there was?\u0027 \u0027Certainly, sir. I had posted myself by the door, and it all went past me, which didn\u0027t seem to please Madame Faujas very much. Wait a moment and I\u0027ll tell you everything there was. First of all they brought up an iron bedstead, then a chest of drawers, then two tables and four chairs; and that was the whole lot of it. And it wasn\u0027t new either. I wouldn\u0027t have given thirty crowns for the whole collection.\u0027 \u0027But you should have told madame; we cannot let the rooms under such conditions. I shall go at once to talk to Abbé Bourrette about the matter.\u0027 He was fuming with irritation, and was just setting off, when Marthe brought him to a sudden halt by saying: [Pg 22] \u0027Oh! I had forgotten to tell you. They have paid me six months\u0027 rent in advance.\u0027 \u0027What! They have paid you?\u0027 he stammered out, almost in a tone of annoyance. \u0027Yes, the old lady came down and gave me this.\u0027 She put her hand into her work-bag, and gave her husband seventy-five francs in hundred-sou-pieces, neatly wrapt up in a piece of newspaper. Mouret counted the money, and muttered: \u0027As long as they pay, they are free to stop. But they are strange folks, all the same. Everyone can\u0027t be rich, of course, but that is no reason why one should behave in this suspicious manner, when one\u0027s poor.\u0027 \u0027There is something else I have to tell you,\u0027 Marthe continued, as she saw him calm down. \u0027The old lady asked me if we were disposed to part with the folding-bed to her. I told her that we made no use of it, and that she was welcome to keep it as long as she liked.\u0027 \u0027You did quite right. We must do what we can to oblige them. As I told you before, what bothers me about these confounded priests is that one never can tell what they are thinking about, or what they are up to. Apart from that, you will often find very honourable men amongst them.\u0027 The money seemed to have consoled him. He joked and teased Serge about his book on the Chinese missions, which the boy happened to be reading just then. During dinner he affected to feel no further curiosity about the tenants of the second floor; but, when Octave mentioned that he had seen Abbé Faujas leaving the Bishop\u0027s residence, he could not restrain himself. Directly the dessert was placed on the table he resumed his chatter of the previous evening, though after a time he began to feel a little ashamed of himself. His commercial pursuits had made him stolid and heavy, but he really had a keen mind; he was possessed of no little common sense and accuracy of judgment which often enabled him to pick out the truth from the midst of all the gossip of the neighbourhood. \u0027After all,\u0027 he said, as he went off to bed, \u0027one has no business to go prying into other people\u0027s affairs. The Abbé is quite at liberty to do as he pleases. It is getting wearisome to be always talking about these people, and I, for my part, shall say nothing more about them.\u0027 A week passed away. Mouret had resumed his habitual[Pg 23] life. He prowled about the house, lectured his children, and spent his afternoons away from home, amusing himself by transacting various bits of business, of which he never spoke; and he ate and slept like a man for whom life is an easy downhill journey, without any jolts or surprises of any kind. The whole place sank back into all its old monotony. Marthe occupied her accustomed seat on the terrace, with her little work-table in front of her. Désirée played by her side. The two lads came home at the usual time, and were as noisy as ever; and Rose, the cook, grumbled and growled at everyone; while the garden and the dining-room retained all their wonted sleepy calm. \u0027You see now,\u0027 Mouret often repeated to his wife, \u0027you were quite mistaken in thinking that our comfort would be interfered with, by our letting the second-floor. We are as quiet and happy as ever we were, and the house seems smaller and cosier.\u0027 He occasionally raised his eyes towards the second-floor windows, which Madame Faujas had hung with thick cotton curtains, on the day after her arrival. These curtains were never drawn aside. There was a conventual look about their stern, cold folds, and they seemed to tell of deep, unbroken silence, cloistral stillness lurking behind them. At distant intervals the windows were set ajar, and allowed the high, shadowy ceilings to be seen between the snowy whiteness of the curtains. But it was all to no purpose that Mouret kept on the watch, he could never catch sight of the hand which opened or closed them, and he never even heard the grating of the window fastening. Never did a sound of human life come down from the second floor. The first week was at an end and Mouret had not yet had another glimpse of Abbé Faujas. That man who was living in his house, without he ever being able to catch sight even of his shadow, began to affect him with a kind of nervous uneasiness. In spite of all the efforts he made to appear indifferent, he relapsed into his old questionings, and started an inquiry. \u0027Have you seen anything of him?\u0027 he asked his wife. \u0027I fancy I caught a glimpse of him yesterday, as he was coming in, but I am not sure. His mother always wears a black dress, and it might have been she that I saw.\u0027 And as he continued to press her with questions, Marthe told him all she knew. [Pg 24] \u0027Rose says that he goes out every day, and stays away a long time. As for his mother, she is as regular as a clock. She comes down at seven o\u0027clock in the morning to go out and do her marketing. She has a big basket, which is always closed, and in which she must bring everything back with her, coal, bread, wine and provisions, for no tradesman ever calls with anything for them. They are very courteous and polite; and Rose says that they always bow to her when they meet her. But as a rule she does not even hear them come down the stairs.\u0027 \u0027They must go in for a funny sort of cooking up there,\u0027 said Mouret, to whom all these details conveyed none of the information he wanted. On another evening, when Octave mentioned that he had seen Abbé Faujas entering Saint-Saturnin\u0027s, his father asked him about the priest\u0027s appearance, what effect he had made upon the passers-by, and what he could be going to do in the church. \u0027Ah! you are really much too curious!\u0027 cried the young man, with a laugh. \u0027He didn\u0027t look very fine in the sunshine with his rusty cassock, I can vouch for that much. I noticed, too, that, as he walked along, he kept in the shadow of the houses, which made his cassock look a little blacker. He didn\u0027t seem at all proud of himself, but hurried along with his head bent down. Two girls began to laugh as he crossed the Place. The Abbé raised his head and looked at them with an expression of great softness—didn\u0027t he, Serge?\u0027 Thereupon Serge related how on several occasions, as he was returning from the college, he had at a distance followed the Abbé, who was on his way back from Saint-Saturnin\u0027s. He passed through the streets without speaking to anyone; he seemed to know nobody and to be rather hurt by the suppressed titters and jeers which he heard around him. \u0027Do they talk of him, then, in the town?\u0027 asked Mouret, whose interest was greatly aroused. \u0027No one has ever spoken to me about him,\u0027 Octave replied. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Serge,\u0027 they do talk of him. Abbé Bourrette\u0027s nephew told me that he wasn\u0027t a favourite at the church. They are not fond of these priests who come from a distance; and besides he has such a miserable appearance. When people get accustomed to him, they will leave the poor man alone, but just at first it is only natural that he should attract notice.\u0027 [Pg 25] Marthe thereupon advised the two young fellows not to gratify any outsider\u0027s curiosity about the Abbé. \u0027Oh, yes! they may answer any questions,\u0027 Mouret exclaimed. \u0027Certainly nothing that we know of him could be likely to compromise him in any way.\u0027 From that time forward, with the best faith in the world and without meaning the least harm, Mouret turned his sons into a couple of spies. He told Octave and Serge that they must repeat to him all that was said about the priest in the town, and he even instructed them to follow him whenever they came across him. But the information that was to be derived from such sources was quickly exhausted. The talk occasioned by the arrival of a strange curate in the diocese died away; the town seemed to have extended its pardon to the \u0027poor fellow,\u0027 who glided about in the shade in such a rusty old cassock, and its only apparent feeling for him now was one of disdain. The priest, on the other hand, always went straight to the cathedral and so returned from it, invariably passing through the same streets. Octave said, laughingly, that he was sure he counted the paving-stones. Then Mouret bethought himself of enlisting the help of Désirée in the task of collecting information. In the evening he took her to the bottom of the garden and listened to her chatter about what she had done and what she had seen during the day, and he always tried to lead her on to the subject of the tenants of the second floor. \u0027Now, just listen to what I tell you,\u0027 he said to her one day. \u0027To-morrow, when the window is open, just throw your ball into the room, and then go up and ask for it.\u0027 The next day the girl threw her ball into the room, but she had scarcely reached the steps of the house before the ball, returned by an invisible hand, bounced up from the terrace. Her father, who had reckoned on the child\u0027s taking ways leading to a renewal of the intercourse which had been interrupted since the day of the priest\u0027s arrival, now lost all hope. It was quite clear that the Abbé had made up his mind to keep to himself. This rebuff, however, only made Mouret\u0027s curiosity all the keener. He even condescended to go gossiping in corners with the cook, to the great displeasure of Marthe, who reproached him for his want of self-respect; but at this he became angry with her and defended himself by lies. However, as he felt that he was in the wrong, it was[Pg 26] only in secret that he henceforth talked to Rose about the Faujases. One morning she beckoned to him to follow her into the kitchen. \u0027Oh, sir!\u0027 she said, as she shut the door, \u0027I have been watching for you to come down from your room for more than an hour.\u0027 \u0027Have you found out something then?\u0027 \u0027Well, you shall hear. Yesterday evening I was chatting with Madame Faujas for more than an hour!\u0027 Mouret felt a thrill of joy. He sat down on an old tattered rush-bottom chair, in the midst of the dirty cloths and vegetable parings left from the previous day, and exclaimed: \u0027Go along! make haste!\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 continued the cook, \u0027I was at the street-door saying good-night to Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s servant, when Madame Faujas came downstairs to empty a pail of dirty water in the gutter. Instead of immediately going back again, without even turning her head, as she generally does, she stopped there for a moment to look at me. Then it struck me that she wanted to speak to me, and I said to her that it had been a beautiful day, and that it would be good for the grapes. She said, \"Yes, yes,\" in an unconcerned sort of way, just like a woman who has no land and has no interest in such matters. But she put down her pail and made no attempt to go away; she even came and leant against the wall beside me—\u0027 \u0027Well! well! what did she say to you?\u0027 cried Mouret, tortured by his impatience. \u0027Well, of course, you understand I wasn\u0027t silly enough to begin to question her. She would have gone straight off if I had. Without seeming to intend anything, I suggested things to her which I thought might set her talking. The Curé[3] of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s, that worthy Monsieur Compan, happened to pass by, and I told her he was very ill and wasn\u0027t long for this world, and that there would be great difficulty in filling his place at the cathedral. She was all ears at once, I can tell you. She even asked me what was the matter with Monsieur Compan. Then, going on from one thing to another, I gradually got talking about our bishop. Monseigneur Rousselot was a most excellent and worthy man, I told her. She did not know his age, so I told her that he was sixty, very delicate also, and that he let himself be led by the nose. There[Pg 27] is a good deal of talk about the vicar-general, Monsieur Fenil, who is all powerful with the bishop. The old lady was quite interested in that, and she would have stayed out in the street all night, listening.\u0027 An expression of desperation passed over Mouret\u0027s face. \u0027But what you\u0027re telling me is what you said yourself,\u0027 he cried. \u0027What was it that she said? That\u0027s what I want to hear.\u0027 \u0027Wait a little and let me finish,\u0027 Rose replied very calmly. \u0027I was gradually gaining my purpose. To win her confidence, I ended by talking to her about ourselves. I told her that you were Monsieur Fran?ois Mouret, a retired merchant from Marseilles, and that you had managed in fifteen years to make a fortune out of wines and oils and almonds. I added that you had preferred to come and settle down and live on your means in Plassans, a quiet town, where your wife\u0027s relations lived. I even contrived to let her know, too, that madame was your cousin, that you were forty years old and that she was thirty-seven, and that you lived very happily together; in fact, I told her all about you. She seemed to be very much interested, and kept saying, \"Yes, yes,\" in her deliberate way; and, when I stopped for a moment, she nodded her head as though to tell me she was listening and that I might go on. So we went on talking in this way, with our backs against the wall, like a couple of old friends, till it was quite dark.\u0027 Mouret bounced from his chair in angry indignation. \u0027What!\u0027 he cried, \u0027is that all? She led you on to gossip to her for an hour, and she herself told you nothing!\u0027 \u0027When it got dark, she said to me: \"The air is becoming quite chilly.\" And then she took up her pail and went back upstairs.\u0027 \u0027You are nothing but an idiot! That old woman up there is more than a match for half a score such as you. Ah! they\u0027ll be laughing finely now that they have wormed out of you all that they wanted to know about us. Do you hear me, Rose? I tell you that you are nothing but an idiot!\u0027 The old cook waxed very indignant, and began to bounce excitedly up and down the kitchen, knocking the pots and pans about noisily, and crumpling up the dusters and flinging them down. \u0027It was scarcely worth your while, sir,\u0027 she hissed, \u0027to[Pg 28] come into my kitchen to call me insulting names. You had better take yourself off. What I did, I did to please you. If madame finds us here together talking about those people, she will be angry with me, and quite rightly, because it is wrong for us to be doing so. And after all, I couldn\u0027t drag words from the old lady\u0027s lips if she wasn\u0027t willing to talk. I did as any one else would have done under the same circumstances. I talked and told her about your affairs, and it was no fault of mine that she didn\u0027t tell me about hers. Go and ask her about them yourself, since you are anxious to know about them. Perhaps you won\u0027t make such an idiot of yourself as I have done.\u0027 She had raised her voice, and was talking so loudly that Mouret thought it would be more prudent to retire, and he did so, closing the kitchen door after him, in order to prevent his wife from hearing the servant. But Rose immediately pulled it open again, and cried after him down the passage: \u0027I shall bother myself about it no longer; do you hear? You may get somebody else to do your underhand business for you!\u0027 Mouret was quite vanquished. He showed some irritation at his defeat, and tried to console himself by saying that those second-floor tenants of his were mere nobodies. Gradually he succeeded in making this opinion of his that of his acquaintances, and then that of the whole town. Abbé Faujas came to be looked upon as a priest without means and without ambition, who was completely outside the pale of the intrigues of the diocese. People imagined that he was ashamed of his poverty, that he was glad to perform any unpleasant duties in connection with the cathedral, and tried to keep himself in obscurity as much as possible. There was only one matter of curiosity left in connection with him, and that was the reason of his having come to Plassans from Besan?on. Queer stories were circulated about him, but they all seemed very improbable. Mouret himself, who had played the spy over his tenants simply for amusement and in order to pass the time, just as he would have played a game at cards or bowls, was even beginning to forget that he had a priest living in his house, when an incident occurred which revived all his curiosity. One afternoon as he was returning home, he saw Abbé Faujas going up the Rue Balande in front of him. Mouret slackened his pace and examined the priest at his leisure.[Pg 29] Although Abbé Faujas had been lodging in his house for a month, this was the first time that he had thus seen him in broad daylight. The Abbé still wore his old cassock, and he walked slowly, with his hat in his hand and his head bare in spite of the chilly air. The street, which was a very steep one, with the shutters of its big, bare houses always closed, was quite deserted. Mouret, who quickened his pace, was at last obliged to walk on tip-toes for fear lest the priest should hear him and make his escape. But as they neared Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s house, a group of people turning out of the Place of the Sub-Prefecture entered it. Abbé Faujas made a slight détour to avoid these persons. He watched the door close, and then, suddenly stopping, he turned round towards his landlord, who was now close up to him. \u0027I am very glad to have met you,\u0027 said he, with all his wonted politeness, \u0027otherwise I should have ventured to disturb you this evening. The last time it rained, the wet came through the ceiling of my room, and I should much like to show it you.\u0027 Mouret remained standing in front of him, and stammered in confusion that he was entirely at the Abbé\u0027s service. Then, as they went indoors together, he asked him at what time he should go to look at the ceiling. \u0027Well, I should like you to come at once,\u0027 the Abbé replied, \u0027if it wouldn\u0027t be troubling you too much.\u0027 Mouret went up the stairs after him so excited that he almost choked, while Rose followed them with her eyes from the kitchen doorway quite dazed with astonishment.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58401.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
