{"id":29424,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER 1","content":"Désirée clapped her hands. She was fourteen years old and big and strong for her age, but she laughed like a little girl of five. \u0027Mother! mother!\u0027 she cried, \u0027look at my doll!\u0027 She showed her mother a strip of rag out of which she had been trying for the last quarter of an hour to manufacture a doll by rolling it and tying it at one end with a piece of string. Marthe raised her eyes from the stockings that she was darning with as much delicacy of work as though she were embroidering, and smiled at Désirée. \u0027Oh! but that\u0027s only a baby,\u0027 she said; \u0027you must make a grown-up doll and it must have a dress, you know, like a lady.\u0027 She gave the child some clippings of print stuff which she found in her work-table, and then again devoted all her attention to her stockings. They were both sitting at one end of the narrow terrace, the girl on a stool at her mother\u0027s feet. The setting sun of a still warm September evening cast its calm peaceful rays around them; and the garden below, which was already growing grey and shadowy, was wrapped in perfect silence. Outside, not a sound could be heard in that quiet corner of the town. They both worked on for ten long minutes without speaking. Désirée was taking immense pains to make a dress for her doll. Every few moments Marthe raised her head and glanced at the child with an expression in which sadness was mingled with affection. Seeing that the girl\u0027s task seemed too much for her, she at last said: [Pg 2] \u0027Give it to me. I will put in the sleeves for you.\u0027 As she took up the doll, two big lads of seventeen and eighteen came down the steps. They ran to Marthe and kissed her. \u0027Don\u0027t scold us, mother!\u0027 cried Octave gaily. \u0027I took Serge to listen to the band. There was such a crowd on the Cours Sauvaire!\u0027 \u0027I thought you had been kept in at college,\u0027 his mother said, \u0027or I should have felt very uneasy.\u0027 Désirée, now altogether indifferent to her doll, had thrown her arms round Serge\u0027s neck, saying to him: \u0027One of my birds has flown away! The blue one, the one you gave me!\u0027 She was on the point of crying. Her mother, who had imagined this trouble to be forgotten, vainly tried to divert her thoughts by showing her the doll. The girl still clung to her brother\u0027s arm and dragged him away with her, while repeating: \u0027Come and let us look for it.\u0027 Serge followed her with kindly complaisance and tried to console her. She led him to a little conservatory, in front of which there was a cage placed on a stand; and here she told him how the bird had escaped just as she was opening the door to prevent it from fighting with a companion. \u0027Well, there\u0027s nothing very surprising in that!\u0027 cried Octave, who had seated himself on the balustrade of the terrace. \u0027She is always interfering with them, trying to find out how they are made and what it is they have in their throats that makes them sing. The other day she was carrying them about in her pockets the whole afternoon to keep them warm.\u0027 \u0027Octave!\u0027 said Marthe, in a tone of reproach; \u0027don\u0027t tease the poor child.\u0027 But Désirée had not heard him; she was explaining to Serge with much detail how the bird had flown away. \u0027It just slipped out, you see, like that, and then it flew over yonder and lighted on Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s big pear-tree. Next it flew off to the plum-tree at the bottom, came back again and went right over my head into the big trees belonging to the Sub-Prefecture, and I\u0027ve never seen it since; no, never since.\u0027 Her eyes filled with tears. \u0027Perhaps it will come back again,\u0027 Serge ventured to say. [Pg 3] \u0027Oh! do you think so? I think I will put the others into a box, and leave the door of the cage open all night.\u0027 Octave could not restrain his laughter, but Marthe called to Désirée: \u0027Come and look here! come and look here!\u0027 Then she gave her the doll. It was a magnificent one now. It had a stiff dress, a head made of a pad of calico, and arms of list sewn on at the shoulders. Désirée\u0027s eyes lighted up with sudden joy. She sat down again upon the stool, and, forgetting all about the bird, began to kiss the doll and dandle it in her arms with childish delight. Serge had gone to lean upon the balustrade near his brother, and Marthe had resumed her darning. \u0027And so the band has been playing, has it?\u0027 she asked. \u0027It plays every Thursday,\u0027 Octave replied. \u0027You ought to have come to hear it, mother. All the town was there; the Rastoil girls, Madame de Condamin, Monsieur Paloque, the mayor\u0027s wife and daughter—why didn\u0027t you come too?\u0027 Marthe did not raise her eyes, but softly replied as she finished darning a hole: \u0027You know very well, my dears, that I don\u0027t care about going out. I am quite contented here; and then it is necessary that someone should stay with Désirée.\u0027 Octave opened his lips to reply, but he glanced at his sister and kept silent. He remained where he was, whistling softly and raising his eyes now towards the trees of the Sub-Prefecture, noisy with the twittering of the sparrows which were preparing to retire for the night—and now towards Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s pear-trees behind which the sun was setting. Serge had taken a book out of his pocket and was reading it attentively. Soft silence brooded over the terrace as it lay there in the yellow light that was gradually growing fainter. Marthe continued darning, ever and anon glancing at her three children in the peaceful quiet of the evening. \u0027Everyone seems to be late to-day,\u0027 she said after a time. \u0027It is nearly six o\u0027clock, and your father hasn\u0027t come home yet. I think he must have gone to Les Tulettes.\u0027 \u0027Oh! then, no wonder he\u0027s late!\u0027 exclaimed Octave. \u0027The peasants at Les Tulettes are never in a hurry to let him go when once they get hold of him. Has he gone there to buy some wine?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Marthe replied. \u0027He isn\u0027t fond, you know, of talking to me about his business.\u0027 [Pg 4] Then there was another interval of silence. In the dining-room, the window of which opened on to the terrace, old Rose had just begun to lay the table with much angry clattering of crockery and plate. She seemed to be in a very bad temper, and banged the chairs about while breaking into snatches of grumbling and growling. At last she went to the street door, and, craning out her head, reconnoitred the square in front of the Sub-Prefecture. After some minutes\u0027 waiting, she came to the terrace-steps and cried: \u0027Monsieur Mouret isn\u0027t coming home to dinner, then?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Rose, wait a little longer,\u0027 Marthe replied quietly. \u0027Everything is getting burned to cinders! There\u0027s no sense in it all. When master goes off on those rounds he ought to give us notice! Well, it\u0027s all the same to me; but your dinner will be quite uneatable.\u0027 \u0027Ah! do you really think so, Rose?\u0027 asked a quiet voice just behind her. \u0027We will eat it, notwithstanding.\u0027 It was Mouret who had just arrived.[2] Rose turned round, looked her master in the face, and seemed on the point of breaking into some angry exclamation; but at the sight of his unruffled countenance, in which twinkled an expression of merry banter, she could not find a word to say, and so she retired. Mouret made his way to the terrace, where he paced about without sitting down. He just tapped Désirée lightly on the cheek with the tips of his fingers, and the girl greeted him with a responsive smile. Marthe raised her eyes, and when she had glanced at her husband she began to fold up her work. \u0027Aren\u0027t you tired?\u0027 asked Octave, looking at his father\u0027s boots, which were white with dust. \u0027Yes, indeed, a little,\u0027 Mouret replied, without, however, saying anything more about the long journey which he had just made on foot. Then in the middle of the garden he caught sight of a spade and a rake, which the children had forgotten there. \u0027Why are the tools not put away?\u0027 he cried. \u0027I have spoken about it a hundred times. If it should come on to rain they would be completely rusted and spoilt.\u0027 He said no more on the subject, but stepped down into the garden, picked up the spade and rake himself, and put them carefully away inside the little conservatory. As he came up[Pg 5] to the terrace again his eyes searched every corner of the walks to see if things were tidy there. \u0027Are you learning your lessons?\u0027 he asked, as he passed Serge, who was still poring over his book. \u0027No, father,\u0027 the boy replied; \u0027this is a book that Abbé Bourrette has lent me. It is an account of the missions in China.\u0027 Mouret stopped short in front of his wife. \u0027By the way,\u0027 said he, \u0027has anyone been here?\u0027 \u0027No, no one, my dear,\u0027 replied Marthe with an appearance of surprise. He seemed on the point of saying something further, but appeared to change his mind, and continued pacing up and down in silence. Then, going to the steps, he cried out: \u0027Well, Rose, what about this dinner of yours which is getting burnt to cinders?\u0027 \u0027Oh, indeed! there is nothing ready for you now!\u0027 shouted the cook in an angry voice from the other end of the passage. \u0027Everything is cold. You will have to wait, sir.\u0027 Mouret smiled in silence and winked with his left eye, as he glanced at his wife and children. He seemed to be very much amused by Rose\u0027s anger. Then he occupied himself in examining his neighbour\u0027s fruit-trees. \u0027It is surprising what splendid pears Monsieur Rastoil has got this year,\u0027 he remarked. Marthe, who had appeared a little uneasy for the last few minutes, seemed as though she wanted to say something. At last she made up her mind to speak, and timidly inquired: \u0027Were you expecting someone to-day, my dear?\u0027 \u0027Yes and no,\u0027 he replied, beginning to pace the terrace again. \u0027Perhaps you have let the second floor?\u0027 \u0027Yes, indeed, I have let it.\u0027 Then, as the silence became a little embarrassing, he added, in his quiet way: \u0027This morning, before starting for Les Tulettes, I went up to see Abbé Bourrette. He was very pressing, and so I agreed to his proposal. I know it won\u0027t please you; but, if you will only think the matter over for a little, you will see that you are wrong, my dear. The second floor was of no use to us, and it was only going to ruin. The fruit that we store in the rooms there brings on dampness which makes the[Pg 6] paper fall from the walls. By the way, now that I think of it, don\u0027t forget to remove the fruit the first thing to-morrow. Our tenant may arrive at any moment.\u0027 \u0027We were so free and comfortable, all alone in our own house,\u0027 Marthe ventured to say, in a low tone. \u0027Oh, well!\u0027 replied Mouret, \u0027we shan\u0027t find a priest in our way. He will keep to himself, and we shall keep to ourselves. Those black-gowned gentlemen hide themselves when they want to swallow even a glass of water. You know that I\u0027m not very partial to them myself. A set of lazybones for the most part! And yet what chiefly decided me to let the floor was that I had found a priest for a tenant. One is quite sure of one\u0027s money with them, and they are so quiet that one can\u0027t even hear them go in and out.\u0027 Marthe still appeared distressed. She looked round her at the happy home basking in the sun\u0027s farewell, at the garden which was now growing greyer with shadows, and at her three children. And she thought of all the happiness which this little spot held for her. \u0027And do you know anything about this priest?\u0027she asked. \u0027No; but Abbé Bourrette has taken the floor in his own name, and that is quite sufficient. Abbé Bourrette is an honourable man. I know that our tenant is called Faujas, Abbé Faujas, and that he comes from the diocese of Besan?on. He didn\u0027t get on very well with his vicar there, and so he has been appointed curate here at Saint-Saturnin\u0027s. Perhaps he knows our bishop, Monseigneur Rousselot. But all this is no business of ours, you know; and it is to Abbé Bourrette that I am trusting in the whole matter.\u0027 Marthe, however, did not seem to share her husband\u0027s confidence, but continued to stand out against him, a thing which seldom happened. \u0027You are right,\u0027 she said, after a moment\u0027s silence, \u0027Abbé Bourrette is a worthy man. But I recollect that when he came to look at the rooms he told me that he did not know the name of the person on whose behalf he was commissioned to rent them. It was one of those commissions which are undertaken by priests in one town for those in another. I really think that you ought to write to Besan?on and make some inquiries as to what sort of a person it is that you are about to introduce into your house.\u0027 Mouret was anxious to avoid losing his temper; he smiled complacently. [Pg 7] \u0027Well, it isn\u0027t the devil, anyhow. Why, you\u0027re trembling all over! I didn\u0027t think you were so superstitious. You surely don\u0027t believe that priests bring ill luck, as folks say. Neither, of course, do they bring good luck. They are just like other men. But, when we get this Abbé here, you\u0027ll see if I\u0027m afraid of his cassock!\u0027 \u0027No, I\u0027m not superstitious; you know that quite well,\u0027 replied Marthe. \u0027I only feel unhappy about it, that\u0027s all.\u0027 He took his stand in front of her, and interrupted her with a sharp motion of his hand. \u0027There! there! that will do,\u0027 said he. \u0027I have let the rooms; don\u0027t let us say anything more about the matter.\u0027 Then, in the bantering tones of a bourgeois who thinks he has done a good stroke of business, he added: \u0027At any rate one thing is certain, and that is that I am to get a hundred and fifty francs rent; and we shall have those additional hundred and fifty francs to spend on the house every year.\u0027 Marthe bent her head and made no further protestations except by vaguely swinging her hands and gently closing her eyes as though to prevent the escape of the tears which were already swelling beneath her eyelids. Then she cast a furtive glance at her children, who had not appeared to hear anything of her discussion with their father. They were, indeed, accustomed to scenes of this sort in which Mouret, with his bantering nature, delighted to indulge. \u0027You can come in now, if you would like something to eat,\u0027 said Rose in her crabby voice, as she came to the steps. \u0027Ah, that\u0027s right! Come along, children, to your soup!\u0027 cried Mouret gaily, without appearing to retain any trace of temper. The whole family rose. But Désirée\u0027s grief seemed to revive at the sight of everyone stirring. She threw her arms round her father\u0027s neck and stammered: \u0027Oh, papa, one of my birds has flown away!\u0027 \u0027One of your birds, my dear? Well, we\u0027ll catch it again.\u0027 Then he began to caress and fondle her, but she insisted that he, also, should go and look at the cage. When he brought her back again Marthe and her two sons were already in the dining-room. The rays of the setting sun, streaming in through the window, lighted up the porcelain plates, the children\u0027s plated mugs, and the white cloth. The[Pg 8] room was warm and peaceful with its green background of garden. But just as Marthe, upon whom the tranquillity of the scene had had a soothing effect, was smilingly removing the cover from the soup-tureen, a noise was heard in the passage. Then Rose rushed into the room with a scared look and stammered: \u0027Monsieur l\u0027Abbé Faujas has come!\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58399.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
