{"id":29434,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER 11","content":"One morning Abbé Bourrette made his appearance, his face betokening the greatest distress. As soon as he caught sight of Marthe on the steps, he hurried up to her and, seizing her hands and pressing them, he stammered: \n \n \u0027Poor Compan! it is all over with him! he is dying! I am going upstairs, I must see Faujas at once.\u0027 \n \n When Marthe showed him his fellow priest, who, according to his wont, was walking to and fro at the bottom of the garden, reading his breviary, he ran up to him, tottering on his short legs. He tried to speak and tell the other the sad news, but his grief choked him, and he could only throw his arms round Abbé Faujas\u0027s neck, while sobbing bitterly. \n \n \u0027Hullo! what\u0027s the matter with the two parsons?\u0027 cried Mouret, who had hastily rushed out of the dining-room. \n \n \u0027The Curé of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s is dying,\u0027 Marthe replied, showing much distress. \n \n [Pg 121] \n \n Mouret assumed an expression of surprise, and, as he went back into the house, he murmured: \n \n \u0027Pooh! that worthy Bourrette will manage to console himself to-morrow when he is appointed Curé in the other\u0027s place. He counts on getting the post; he told me so.\u0027 \n \n Abbé Faujas disengaged himself from the old priest\u0027s embrace, quietly closed his breviary, and listened to the sad news with a grave face. \n \n \u0027Compan wants to see you,\u0027 said Abbé Bourrette in a broken voice; \u0027he will not last the morning out. Oh! he has been a dear friend to me! We studied together. He is anxious to say good-bye to you. He has been telling me all through the night that you were the only man of courage in the diocese. For more than a year now he has been getting weaker and weaker, and not a single Plassans priest has dared to go and grasp his hand; while you, a stranger, who scarcely knew him, you have spent an afternoon with him every week. The tears came into his eyes just now as he was speaking of you; you must lose no time, my friend.\u0027 \n \n Abbé Faujas went up to his room for a moment, while Abbé Bourrette paced impatiently and hopelessly about the passage; and then at last they set off together. The old priest wiped his brow and swayed about on the road as he talked in disconnected fashion: \n \n \u0027He would have died like a dog without a single prayer being said for him if his sister had not come and told me about him at eleven o\u0027clock last night. She did quite right, the dear lady, though he did not want to compromise any of us, and even would have foregone the last sacraments. Yes, my friend, he was dying all alone, abandoned and deserted, he who had so high a mind, and who has only lived to do good!\u0027 \n \n Then Bourrette became silent; but after a few moments he resumed again in a different voice: \n \n \u0027Do you think that Fenil will ever forgive me for this? Never, I expect! When Compan saw me bringing the viaticum, he was unwilling to let me anoint him and told me to go away. Well, well! it\u0027s all over with me now, and I shall never be Curé! But I am glad that I did it, and that I haven\u0027t let Compan die like a dog. He has been at war with Fenil for thirty years, you know. When he took to his bed he said to me, \"Ah! it\u0027s Fenil who is going to carry the day! Now that I am stricken down he will get the better of[Pg 122] me!\" So think of it! That poor Compan, whom I have seen so high-spirited and energetic at Saint-Saturnin\u0027s! Little Eusèbe, the choir-boy, whom I took to ring the viaticum bell, was quite embarrassed when he found where we were going. He kept looking behind him at each tinkle, as if he was afraid that Fenil would hear it.\u0027 \n \n Abbé Faujas, who was stepping along quickly with bent head and a preoccupied air, kept perfectly silent, and did not even seem to hear what his companion was saying. \n \n \u0027Has the Bishop been informed?\u0027 he suddenly asked. \n \n But Abbé Bourrette in his turn now appeared to be buried in thought and made no reply; however, just as they reached Abbé Compan\u0027s door he said to his companion: \n \n \u0027Tell him that we met Fenil and that he bowed to us. It will please him, for he will then think that I shall be appointed Curé.\u0027 \n \n They went up the stairs in silence. The Curé\u0027s sister came to the landing, and on seeing them burst into tears. Then she stammered between her sobs: \n \n \u0027It is all over! He has just passed away in my arms. I was quite alone with him. As he was dying, he looked round him and murmured, \"I must have the plague since they have all deserted me.\" Ah! gentlemen he died with his eyes full of tears.\u0027 \n \n They went into the little room where Abbé Compan, with his head resting on his pillow, seemed to be asleep. His eyes had remained open, and tears yet trickled down his white sad face. Then Abbé Bourrette fell upon his knees, sobbing and praying, with his face pressed to the counterpane. Abbé Faujas at first remained standing, gazing at the dead man; and after having knelt for a moment, he quietly went away. Abbé Bourrette was so absorbed in his grief that he did not even hear his colleague close the door. \n \n Abbé Faujas went straight to the Bishop\u0027s. In Monseigneur Rousselot\u0027s ante-chamber he met Abbé Surin, carrying a bundle of papers. \n \n \u0027Do you want to speak to his lordship?\u0027 asked the secretary, with his never-failing smile. \u0027You have come at an unfortunate time. His lordship is so busy that he has given orders that no one is to be admitted.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But I want to see him on a very urgent matter,\u0027 quietly said Abbé Faujas. \u0027You can at any rate let him know that I am here; and I will wait, if it is necessary.\u0027 \n \n [Pg 123] \n \n \u0027I am afraid that it would be useless for you to wait. His lordship has several people with him. It would be better if you came again to-morrow.\u0027 \n \n But the Abbé took a chair, and just as he was doing so the Bishop opened the door of his study. He appeared much vexed on seeing his visitor, whom at first he pretended not to recognise. \n \n \u0027My son,\u0027 he said to Surin, \u0027when you have arranged those papers, come to me immediately; there is a letter I want to dictate to you.\u0027 \n \n Then turning to the priest, who remained respectfully standing, he said: \n \n \u0027Ah! is it you, Monsieur Faujas? I am very glad to see you. Perhaps you want to say something to me? Come into my study; you are never in the way.\u0027 \n \n Monseigneur Rousselot\u0027s study was a very large and rather gloomy room, in which a great wood fire was kept burning in the summer as well as the winter. The heavy carpet and curtains kept out all the air, and the room was like a warm bath. The Bishop, like some dowager shutting herself up from the world, detesting all noise and excitement, lived a chilly life there in his armchair, committing to Abbé Fenil the care of his diocese. He delighted in the classics, and it was said that he was secretly making a translation of Horace. He was equally fond of the little verses of the Anthology, and broad quotations occasionally escaped from his lips, quotations which he enjoyed with the na?veté of a learned man who cares nothing for the modesty of the vulgar. \n \n \u0027There is no one here, you see,\u0027 said he, sitting down before the fire; \u0027but I don\u0027t feel very well to-day, and I gave orders that nobody was to be admitted. Now you can tell me what you have to say; I am quite at your service.\u0027 \n \n His general expression of amiability was tinged with a kind of vague uneasiness, a sort of resigned submission. When Abbé Faujas had informed him of the death of Abbé Compan, he rose from his chair, apparently both distressed and alarmed. \n \n \u0027What!\u0027 he cried, \u0027my good Compan dead! and I was not able to bid him farewell! No one gave me any warning! Ah, my friend, you were right when you gave me to understand that I was no longer master here. They abuse my kindness.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Your lordship knows,\u0027 said Abbé Faujas, \u0027how devoted I am to you. I am only waiting for a sign from you.\u0027 \n \n [Pg 124] \n \n The Bishop shook his head as he murmured: \n \n \u0027Yes, yes; I remember the offer you made to me. You have an excellent heart; but what an uproar there would be, if I were to break with Abbé Fenil! I should have my ears deafened for a whole week! And yet if I could feel quite sure that you could really rid me of him, if I was not afraid that at a week\u0027s end he would come back and crush your neck under his heel——\u0027 \n \n Abbé Faujas could not repress a smile. Tears were welling from the Bishop\u0027s eyes. \n \n \u0027Yes, I am afraid, I am afraid,\u0027 the prelate resumed, as he again sank down into his chair. \u0027I don\u0027t feel equal to it yet. It is that miserable man who has killed Compan and has kept his death agony a secret from me so that I might not go and close his eyes. He is capable of the most terrible things. But, you see, I like to live in peace. Fenil is very energetic and he renders me great services in the diocese. When I am no longer here, matters will perhaps be better ordered.\u0027 \n \n He grew calmer again and his smile returned. \n \n \u0027Besides, everything is going on satisfactorily at present, and I don\u0027t see any immediate difficulty. We can wait.\u0027 \n \n Abbé Faujas sat down, and calmly resumed: \n \n \u0027No doubt: but still you will have to appoint a Curé for Saint-Saturnin\u0027s in succession to the Abbé Compan.\u0027 \n \n Monseigneur Rousselot lifted his hands to his temples with an expression of hopelessness. \n \n \u0027Indeed, you are right!\u0027 he ejaculated. \u0027I had forgotten that. Poor Compan doesn\u0027t know in what a hole he has put me, by dying so suddenly without my having had any warning. I promised you that place, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 \n \n The Abbé bowed. \n \n \u0027Well, my friend, you will save me by letting me take back my word. You know how Fenil detests you. The success of the Home of the Virgin has made him quite furious, and he swears that he will prevent you from making the conquest of Plassans. I am talking to you quite openly, you see. Recently, when reference was made to the appointment of a Curé for Saint-Saturnin\u0027s, I let your name fall. But Fenil flew into a frightful rage and I was obliged to promise that I would give the place to a friend of his, Abbé Chardon, whom you know, and who is really a very worthy man. Now, my friend, do this much for me, and give up that idea. I will make you whatever recompense you like to name.\u0027 \n \n [Pg 125] \n \n The priest\u0027s face wore a grave expression. After a short interval of silence during which he seemed to be taking counsel of himself, he spoke: \n \n \u0027You know very well, my lord,\u0027 he said, \u0027that I am quite without personal ambition. I should much prefer to lead a life of privacy, and it would be a great relief to me to give up this appointment. But I am not my own master, I feel bound to satisfy those patrons of mine who take an interest in me. I trust that your lordship will reflect very seriously before taking a step which you would probably regret afterwards.\u0027 \n \n Although Abbé Faujas spoke very humbly, the Bishop was not unconscious of the menace which his words veiled. He rose from his chair and took a few steps about the room, a prey to the painful perplexity. \n \n \u0027Well, well,\u0027 he said, lifting his hands, \u0027here\u0027s trouble and no mistake, for a long time. I should much have preferred to avoid all these explanations, but, since you insist, I must speak frankly. Well, my dear sir, Abbé Fenil brings many charges against you. As I think I told you before, he must have written to Besan?on and learnt all the vexatious stories you know of. You have certainly explained those matters to me, and I am quite aware of your merits and of your life of penitence and solitude; but what can I do? Fenil has weapons against you and he uses them ruthlessly. I often don\u0027t know what to say in your defence. When the Minister requested me to receive you into my diocese, I did not conceal from him that your position would be a difficult one; but he continued to press me and said that that was your affair, and so in the end I consented. But you must not come to-day and ask me to do what is impossible.\u0027 \n \n Abbé Faujas had not lowered his head during the Bishop\u0027s remarks. He now raised it still higher as he looked the prelate straight in the face and said in his sharp voice: \n \n \u0027You have given me your promise, my lord.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Certainly, certainly,\u0027 the Bishop replied. \u0027That poor Compan was getting weaker every day and you came and confided certain matters to me, and I then made the promise to you. I don\u0027t deny it. Listen to me, I will tell you everything, so that you may not accuse me of wheeling round like a weathercock. You asserted that the Minister was extremely desirous for you to be appointed Curé of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s. Well, I wrote for information on the subject, and a friend of[Pg 126] mine went to the Ministry in Paris. They almost laughed in his face there, and they told him that they didn\u0027t even know you. The Minister absolutely denies that he is your supporter, do you hear? If you wish it, I will read you a letter in which he makes some very stern remarks about you.\u0027 \n \n He stretched his arm towards a drawer, but Abbé Faujas rose to his feet without taking his eyes off him, and smiled with mingled irony and pity. \n \n \u0027Ah, my lord! my lord!\u0027 said he. \n \n Then, after a moment\u0027s silence, as though he were unwilling to enter into further explanations, he said: \n \n \u0027I give your lordship back your promise; but believe that in all this I was working more for your own advantage than for mine. By-and-by, when it will be too late, you will call my warnings to mind.\u0027 \n \n He stepped towards the door, but the Bishop laid his hand upon him and brought him back, saying with an expression of uneasiness: \n \n \u0027What do you mean? Explain yourself, my dear Monsieur Faujas. I know very well that I have not been in favour at Paris since the election of the Marquis de Lagrifoul. But people know me very little if they suppose that I had any hand in the matter. I don\u0027t go out of my study twice a month. Do you imagine that they accuse me of having brought about the marquis\u0027s return?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Yes, I am afraid so,\u0027 the priest curtly replied. \n \n \u0027But it is quite absurd! I have never interfered in politics; I live amongst my beloved books. It was Fenil who did it all. I told him a score of times that he would end by compromising me in Paris.\u0027 \n \n He checked himself and blushed slightly at having allowed these last words to escape him. Abbé Faujas sat down again and said in a deep voice: \n \n \u0027My lord, by those words you have condemned your vicar-general. I have never said otherwise than you have just said. Do not continue to make common cause with him or he will lead you into serious trouble. I have friends in Paris, whatever you may believe. I know that the Marquis de Lagrifoul\u0027s election has strongly predisposed the Government against you. Rightly or wrongly, they believe that you are the sole cause of the opposition movement which has manifested itself in Plassans, where the Minister, for special reasons, is most anxious to have a majority. If the Legitimist candidate[Pg 127] should again succeed at the next election, it would be very awkward, and I should be considerably alarmed for your comfort.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But this is abominable!\u0027 cried the unhappy Bishop, rocking himself in his chair; \u0027I can\u0027t prevent the Legitimist candidate from being returned! I haven\u0027t got the least influence, and I never mix myself up in these matters at all. Really, there are times when I feel that I should like to shut myself up in a monastery. I could take my books with me, and lead a quiet, peaceful life there. It is Fenil who ought to be Bishop instead of me. If I were to listen to Fenil, I should get on the very worst terms with the Government. I should hearken only to Rome, and tell Paris to mind its own business. But that is not my nature, and I want to die in peace. The Minister, then, you say, is enraged with me?\u0027 \n \n The priest made no reply. Two creases which appeared at the corners of his mouth gave his face an expression of silent scorn. \n \n \u0027Really,\u0027 continued the Bishop, \u0027if I thought it would please him if I were to appoint you Curé of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s, I would try to manage it. But I can assure you that you are mistaken. You are but little in the odour of sanctity.\u0027 \n \n Abbé Faujas made a hasty movement of his hands, as he broke out impatiently: \n \n \u0027Have you forgotten that calumnies are circulated about me, and that I came to Plassans in a threadbare cassock? When they send a compromised man to a post of danger, they deny all knowledge of him till the day of triumph. Help me to succeed, my lord, and then you will see that I have friends in Paris.\u0027 \n \n Then, as the Bishop, surprised to find in a priest such a bold adventurer, continued to gaze at him in silence, Faujas lapsed into a less assertive manner and continued: \n \n \u0027These, however, are suppositions, and what I mean is, that I have much to be pardoned. My friends are waiting to thank you till my position is completely established.\u0027 \n \n Monseigneur Rousselot kept silence for a moment longer. He was a man of sharp understanding, and he had gained a knowledge of human failings from books. He was conscious of his own yielding character, and he was even a little ashamed of it; but he consoled himself for it by judging men for what they were worth. In the life of a learned epicurean, which he led, there were times when he felt supreme disdain[Pg 128] for the ambitious men about him, who fought amongst themselves for a few stray shreds of his power. \n \n \u0027Well,\u0027 he said, with a smile, \u0027you are a pertinacious man, my dear Monsieur Faujas, and since I have made you a promise I will keep it. Six months ago, I confess, I should have been afraid of stirring up all Plassans against me, but you have succeeded in making yourself liked, and the ladies of the town often speak to me about you in very eulogistic terms. In appointing you Curé of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s, I am only paying the debt which we owe you for the Home of the Virgin.\u0027 \n \n The Bishop had recovered his usual pleasant amiability and charming manner. Just at this moment Abbé Surin put his handsome head through the doorway. \n \n \u0027No, my child,\u0027 said the Bishop to him, \u0027I shall not dictate that letter to you. I have no further need of you, and you can go.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Abbé Fenil is here,\u0027 muttered the young priest. \n \n \u0027Oh, very well, let him wait!\u0027 \n \n Monseigneur Rousselot winced slightly; but he spoke to his secretary with an almost ludicrous expression of decision, and looked at Abbé Faujas with a glance of intelligence. \n \n \u0027See! go out this way,\u0027 he said to him, as he opened a door that was hidden behind a curtain. \n \n He kept the priest standing on the threshold for a moment, and continued to look at him with a smile on his face. \n \n \u0027Fenil will be furious,\u0027 said he; \u0027but you will promise to defend me against him if he is too hard upon me! I am making him your enemy, I warn you of that. I am counting upon you, too, to prevent the re-election of the Marquis de Lagrifoul. Ah! it is upon you that I am leaning now, my dear Monsieur Faujas.\u0027 \n \n He waved his white hand to the Abbé, and then returned with an appearance of perfect unconcern to the warmth of his study. The priest had remained bowing, feeling surprised at the quite feminine ease with which the Bishop changed his master and yielded to the stronger side. And only now did he begin to feel that Monseigneur Rousselot had been secretly laughing at him, even as he laughed at Abbé Fenil in that downy armchair of his where he read his Horace. \n \n About ten o\u0027clock on the following Thursday, just when the fashionable folks of Plassans were treading on each other\u0027s toes in the Rougons\u0027 green drawing-room, Abbé Faujas[Pg 129] appeared at the door. He looked tall and majestic, there was a bright colour on his cheeks, and he wore a delicate cassock that glistened like satin. His face was still grave, though there was a slight smile upon it, just the pleasant turn of the lips that was necessary to light up his stern countenance with a ray of cheerfulness. \n \n \u0027Ah! here is the dear Curé!\u0027 Madame de Condamin gaily exclaimed. \n \n The mistress of the house eagerly hastened up to him; she grasped one of his hands within both her own, and drew him into the middle of the room, with wheedling glances and a gentle swaying of her head. \n \n \u0027This is a surprise! a very pleasant surprise!\u0027 she cried. \u0027It\u0027s an age since we have seen you! Is it only when good fortune visits you that you can remember your friends?\u0027 \n \n Abbé Faujas bowed with easy composure. All around him there was a flattering ovation, a buzzing of enthusiastic women. Madame Delangre and Madame Rastoil did not wait till he came up to them, but hastened to congratulate him upon his appointment, which had been officially announced that morning. The mayor, the justice of the peace, and even Monsieur de Bourdeu, all stepped up to him and shook his hand heartily. \n \n \u0027Ah, he\u0027s a fine fellow and will go a long way!\u0027 Monsieur de Condamin murmured into Doctor Porquier\u0027s ear. \u0027I scented him from the first day I saw him. That grimacing old Madame Rougon and he tell no end of lies. I have seen him slipping in here at dusk half a score of times. They must be mixed up in some queer things together.\u0027 \n \n Doctor Porquier was terribly afraid of being compromised by Monsieur de Condamin, so he hurried away from him, and came like the others to grasp Abbé Faujas\u0027s hand, although he had never previously spoken to him. \n \n The priest\u0027s triumphal entry was the great event of the evening. He had now seated himself and was hemmed in by a triple circle of petticoats. He talked with charming good nature on all sorts of subjects, but avoided replying to any hints or allusions. When Félicité directly questioned him, he merely said that he should not occupy the parsonage, as he preferred remaining in the lodgings where he had found himself so comfortable for nearly three years. Marthe was present among the other ladies, and was, as usual, extremely reserved. She had only just smiled at the Abbé, watching him from a[Pg 130] distance, and looking the while a little pale and rather weary and uneasy. When he signified his intention of not quitting the Rue Balande, she blushed and rose to go into the small drawing-room as if she felt incommoded by the heat. Madame Paloque, beside whom Monsieur de Condamin had seated himself, said to him quite loud enough to be heard: \n \n \u0027It\u0027s very decorous, isn\u0027t it? She certainly might refrain from making assignations with him here, since they have the whole day to themselves!\u0027 \n \n Only Monsieur de Condamin laughed; everyone else received the sally very coldly. Then Madame Paloque, recognising that she had made a mistake, tried to turn the matter off as a joke. Meantime in the corners of the room the guests were discussing Abbé Fenil. Great curiosity was manifested as to whether he would put in an appearance. Monsieur de Bourdeu, who was one of his friends, said with an air of authority that he was indisposed—a statement which was received by the company with discreet smiles. Everyone was quite aware of the revolution that had taken place at the Bishop\u0027s. Abbé Surin gave the ladies some very interesting details of the terrible scene that had taken place between his lordship and the grand-vicar. The latter, on getting the worst of the struggle, had caused it to be reported that he was confined to his room by an attack of gout. But the fight was not over, and Abbé Surin hinted that a good deal more would happen yet, a remark which was whispered about the room with many little exclamations, shakings of heads and expressions of surprise and doubt. For the moment, at any rate, Abbé Faujas was carrying everything before him and so the fair devotees sunned themselves pleasantly in the rays of the rising luminary. \n \n About the middle of the evening Abbé Bourrette arrived. Conversation ceased and people looked at him with curiosity. They all knew that he had expected to be appointed Curé of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s himself. He had taken over the Abbé Compan\u0027s duties during the latter\u0027s long illness, and he had a lien upon the appointment. He lingered for a moment by the door, a little out of breath and with blinking eyes, without being aware of the interest which his appearance excited. Then, catching sight of Abbé Faujas, he eagerly hastened up to him, and seizing both his hands with a show of much pleasure exclaimed: \n \n [Pg 131] \n \n \u0027Ah! my dear friend, let me congratulate you! I have just come from your rooms, where your mother told me that you were here. I am delighted to see you.\u0027 \n \n Abbé Faujas had risen from his seat, and notwithstanding his great self-control, he seemed annoyed, taken by surprise, as it were, by this unexpected display of affection. \n \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he murmured, \u0027I felt bound to accept his lordship\u0027s offer in spite of my lack of merit. I refused it, indeed, at first, mentioning the names of several more deserving priests than myself. I mentioned your own name.\u0027 \n \n Abbé Bourrette blinked, and taking Abbé Faujas aside he said to him in low tones: \n \n \u0027His lordship has told me all about it. Fenil, it seems, would not hear of me. He would have set the whole diocese in a blaze if I had been appointed. Those were his very words. My crime is having closed poor Compan\u0027s eyes. He demanded, as you know, the appointment of Abbé Chardon, a pious man, no doubt, but not of sufficient reputation. Fenil counted on reigning at Saint-Saturnin\u0027s in his name. It was then that his lordship determined to give you the place and checkmate him. I am quite avenged, and I am delighted, my dear friend. Did you know the full story?\u0027 \n \n \u0027No, not in all its details.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Well, it is all just as I have told you, I can assure you. I have the facts from his lordship\u0027s own lips. Between ourselves, he has hinted to me of a very sufficient recompense. The deputy vicar-general, Abbé Vial, has for a long time been desirous of settling in Rome, and his place will be vacant, you understand. But don\u0027t say anything about this. I wouldn\u0027t take a big sum of money for my day\u0027s work.\u0027 \n \n He continued pressing both Abbé Faujas\u0027s hands, while his broad face beamed with satisfaction. The ladies around them were smiling and looking at them in surprise. But the worthy man\u0027s joy was so frank and unreserved that it communicated itself to all in the green drawing-room, where the ovation in the new Curé\u0027s honour took a more familiar and affectionate turn. The ladies grouped themselves together and spoke of the cathedral organ which wanted repairing, and Madame de Condamin promised a magnificent altar for the procession on the approaching festival of Corpus Christi. \n \n Abbé Bourrette was sharing in the general triumph when Madame Paloque, craning out her hideous face, touched him on the shoulder and murmured in his ear: \n \n [Pg 132] \n \n \u0027Your reverence won\u0027t, I suppose, hear confessions to-morrow in Saint-Michael\u0027s chapel?\u0027 \n \n The priest, while taking Abbé Compan\u0027s duty, had occupied the confessional in Saint-Michael\u0027s chapel, which was the largest and most convenient in the church and was specially reserved for the Curé. He did not at first understand the force of Madame Paloque\u0027s remark, and he looked at her, again blinking his eyes. \n \n \u0027I ask you,\u0027 she continued, \u0027if you will resume your old confessional in the chapel of the Holy Angels, to-morrow.\u0027 \n \n He turned rather pale and remained silent for a moment longer. Then he bent his gaze to the floor, and a slight shiver coursed down his neck, as though he had received a blow from behind. And, seeing that Madame Paloque was still there staring at him, he stammered out: \n \n \u0027Certainly; I shall go back to my old confessional. Come to the chapel of the Holy Angels, the last one on the left, on the same side as the cloisters. It is very damp, so wrap yourself up well, dear madame, wrap yourself up well.\u0027 \n \n Tears rose to his eyes. He was filled with regretful longing for that handsome confessional in the chapel of Saint-Michael, into which the warm sun streamed in the afternoon just at the time when he heard confessions. Until now he had felt no sorrow at relinquishing the cathedral to Abbé Faujas; but this little matter, this removal from one chapel to another, affected him very painfully; and it seemed to him that he had missed the goal of his life. Madame Paloque told him in her loud voice that he appeared to have grown melancholy all at once, but he protested against this assertion and tried to smile and look cheerful again. However he left the drawing-room early in the evening. \n \n Abbé Faujas was one of the last to go. Rougon came up to him to offer his congratulations and they remained talking earnestly together on a couch. They spoke of the necessity of religious feeling in a wisely ordered state. Each lady, on retiring from the room, made a low bow as she passed in front of them. \n \n \u0027You know, Monsieur le Curé,\u0027 said Félicité graciously, \u0027that you are my daughter\u0027s cavalier.\u0027 \n \n The priest rose from his seat. Marthe was waiting for him at the door. When they got out into the street, they seemed as if blinded by the darkness, and crossed the Place of the Sub-Prefecture without exchanging a word; but in the[Pg 133] Rue Balande, as they stood in front of the house, Marthe touched the priest\u0027s arm at the moment when he was about to insert the key in the lock. \n \n \u0027I am so very pleased at your success,\u0027 she said to him, in a tone of great emotion. \u0027Be kind to me to-day, and grant me the favour which you have hitherto refused. I assure you that Abbé Bourrette does not understand me. It is only you who can direct and save me.\u0027 \n \n He motioned her away from him, and, when he had opened the door and lighted the little lamp which Rose had left at the foot of the staircase, he went upstairs, saying to her gently as he did so: \n \n \u0027You promised me to be reasonable—well, I will think over what you have asked. We will talk about it.\u0027 \n \n Marthe did not retire to her own room until she had heard the priest close his door on the upper floor. While she was undressing and getting into bed she paid no attention whatever to Mouret, who, half asleep, was retailing to her at great length some gossip that was being circulated in the town. He had been to his club, the Commercial Club, a place where he rarely set foot. \n \n \u0027Abbé Faujas has got the better of Abbé Bourrette,\u0027 he repeated for the tenth time as he slowly rolled his head upon the pillow. \u0027Poor Abbé Bourrette! Well, never mind! it\u0027s good fun to see those parsons devouring one another. The other day when they were hugging each other in the garden—you remember it, don\u0027t you?—anyone would have thought that they were brothers. Ah! they rob each other even of their very penitents. But why don\u0027t you say anything, my dear? You don\u0027t agree with me, eh? Or is it because you are going to sleep? Well, well, good-night then, my dear.\u0027 \n \n He fell asleep, still muttering disjointed words, while Marthe, with widely opened eyes, stared up into the air and followed over the ceiling, faintly illumined by the night-light, the pattering of the Abbé\u0027s slippers while he was retiring to rest. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58409.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
