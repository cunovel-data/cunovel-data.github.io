{"id":29430,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER 7","content":"That same night Mouret, who was still awake when his wife returned home, plied her with questions in his desire to find out what had taken place at Madame Rougon\u0027s. She told him that everything had gone off as usual, and that she had noticed nothing out of the common. She just added that Abbé Faujas had walked home with her, but had merely spoken of commonplace matters. Mouret was very much vexed at what he called his wife\u0027s indolence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If anyone had committed suicide at your mother\u0027s,\u0027 he growled, as he angrily buried his head in his pillow, \u0027you would know nothing about it!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n When he came home to dinner the next day, he called to Marthe as soon as he caught sight of her: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I was sure of it! I knew you had never troubled yourself to use your eyes! It\u0027s just like you! Sitting the whole evening in a room and never having the faintest notion of what was being said or done around you! Why, the whole town is talking about it! The whole town, do you hear? I couldn\u0027t go anywhere without somebody speaking to me about——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027About what, my dear?\u0027 asked Marthe, in astonishment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027About the fine success of Abbé Faujas, forsooth! He was turned out of the green drawing-room!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Indeed he wasn\u0027t! I saw nothing of the kind.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 69] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Haven\u0027t I told you that you never see anything? Do you know what the Abbé did at Besan?on? He either murdered a priest or committed forgery! They are not quite certain which it was. However, they seem to have given him a nice reception! He turned quite green. Well, it\u0027s all up with him now!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe bent her head and allowed her husband to revel in the priest\u0027s discomfiture. Mouret was delighted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I still stick to my first idea,\u0027 he said; \u0027your mother and he have got some underhand plot together. I hear that she showed him the greatest civility. It was she, wasn\u0027t it, who asked him to accompany you home? Why didn\u0027t you tell me so?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe shrugged her shoulders without replying. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are the most provoking woman in the world!\u0027 her husband cried. \u0027All these little details are of the greatest importance. Madame Paloque, whom I have just met, told me that she and several other ladies had lingered behind to see how the Abbé would effect his departure, and that your mother availed herself of you to cover the parson\u0027s retreat. Just try to remember, now, what he said to you as he walked home with you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He sat down by his wife\u0027s side with his keen, questioning little eyes fixed upon her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Really,\u0027 said she quietly, \u0027he only talked to me about the trifling commonplace matters such as anyone might have talked of. He spoke about the cold, which was very sharp, and about the quietness of the town at night-time, and I think he mentioned the pleasant evening he had passed.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah, the hypocrite! Didn\u0027t he ask you any questions about your mother or her guests?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No. The Rue de la Banne is only a very short distance, you know, and it didn\u0027t take us three minutes. He walked by my side without offering me his arm, and he took such long strides that I was almost obliged to run. I don\u0027t know why folks should all be so bitter against him. He doesn\u0027t seem very well off, and he was shivering, poor man, in that threadbare old cassock of his.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret was not without pity and sympathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah! he must have done,\u0027 he said; \u0027he can\u0027t feel very warm now that the frost has come.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure we have nothing to complain of in his conduct,\u0027 Marthe continued. \u0027He is very punctual in his payments,[Pg 70] and he makes no noise and gives no trouble. Where could you find a more desirable tenant?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nowhere, I grant you. What I was saying just now was to show you what little attention you pay, wherever you go, to what takes place around you. I know the set your mother receives too well to attach much weight to anything that happens in the green drawing-room: it\u0027s a perpetual source of lies and the most ridiculous stories. I don\u0027t suppose for a moment that the Abbé ever murdered anyone any more than that he was ever a bankrupt; and I told Madame Paloque that people ought to see that their own linen was clean before they found fault with that of others. I hope she took the hint to herself.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n This was a fib on Mouret\u0027s part, for he had said nothing of the kind to Madame Paloque; but Marthe\u0027s pity had made him feel rather ashamed of the delight which he had manifested at the Abbé\u0027s troubles. On the following days he went entirely over to the priest\u0027s side, and whenever he happened to meet any people whom he detested, Monsieur de Bourdeu, Monsieur Delangre, and Doctor Porquier, he launched out into warm praises of the Abbé just for the pleasure of astonishing and annoying them. The Abbé, said he, was a man of great courage and perfect guilelessness, but extremely poor, and some very base-minded person must have originated the calumnies about him. Then he went on to have a rap at the Rougons\u0027 guests, whom he called hypocrites, canting humbugs and stuck-up idiots, who were afraid of a man of real virtue. In a short time he had quite made the Abbé\u0027s quarrel his own, and availed himself of it to attack both the Rastoil gang and the gang of the Sub-Prefecture as well. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Isn\u0027t it pitiable?\u0027 he sometimes said to his wife, forgetting that she had heard him tell a very different story, \u0027isn\u0027t it pitiable to see a lot of people who stole their money no one knows where, leaguing so bitterly against a poor man just because he hasn\u0027t got twenty francs to spare to buy a cart-load of firewood? Such conduct quite disgusts me! I\u0027m quite willing to be surety for him. I ought to know what he does and what sort of a man he is, since he lives in my house; and so I\u0027m not slack in telling them the truth, I give them all they deserve when I meet them. And I won\u0027t content myself with that, either. I want the Abbé to be my friend, and I mean to walk out with him arm-in-arm along the promenade to let people know that I\u0027m not afraid of being seen with him,[Pg 71] rich and well thought of as I am! I hope, too, that you will show all the kindness and consideration to these poor people that you can.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe smiled quietly. She was delighted at the friendly disposition her husband was now manifesting towards their lodgers. Rose was ordered to show them every civility; she was even told that she might volunteer to do Madame Faujas\u0027 shopping for her on wet mornings. The latter, however, always declined the cook\u0027s services, though she no longer manifested that silent stiffness of demeanour which she had shown during the earlier days of her residence in the house. One morning, as she met Marthe, who was coming down from an attic which was used as a store-room for the fruit, she stopped and talked to her for a moment, and even unbent so far as to accept a couple of magnificent pears. Those pears were the beginning of a closer intimacy between them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abbé Faujas, too, did not now glide so hurriedly up and down the stairs as he had been wont to do. Almost every day, when Mouret heard the rustling of the priest\u0027s cassock as he came down, he hastened to the foot of the staircase and told the Abbé that it would give him great pleasure to walk part of the way with him. He had also thanked him for the little service he had done his wife, skilfully questioning him at the time to find out if he intended again calling on the Rougons. The Abbé had smiled and freely confessed that he was not fitted for society. This had delighted Mouret, who felt quite certain that he had had some influence in bringing about his lodger\u0027s decision. He even began to dream of preventing all future intercourse with the green drawing-room and of keeping him altogether to himself. So, when Marthe told him one evening that Madame Faujas had accepted a couple of pears, he looked upon this as a fortunate circumstance which would facilitate the execution of his designs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Haven\u0027t they really got a fire on the second floor this bitterly cold weather?\u0027 he asked, in Rose\u0027s presence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No, indeed, sir,\u0027 replied the cook, who understood that the question was meant for herself; \u0027they couldn\u0027t very well have one, for I\u0027ve never seen the least bit of wood taken upstairs, unless indeed they\u0027re burning their four chairs or Madame Faujas manages to carry up the wood in her basket.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is not right of you to talk in that way, Rose,\u0027 said Marthe. \u0027The poor things must be shivering with cold in those big rooms.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 72] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I should think so, indeed,\u0027 exclaimed Mouret; \u0027there were several degrees of frost last night and there was considerable fear felt about the olive-trees. The water in our jug upstairs was frozen. This room of ours here is a small one, however, and very warm.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The doors and windows of the dining-room were provided with pads, so that no draught could find its way through any crevice, and a big earthenware stove made the place as warm as a bakehouse. During the winter evenings the young people read or played round the table, while Mouret made his wife play piquet till bed-time, which, by the way, was perfect torture to her. For a long time she had refused to touch the cards, saying that she did not know a single game, but at last he had taught her piquet, and she had then been forced to resign herself to her fate. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you think,\u0027 Mouret continued, \u0027that we really ought to ask the Faujases to come and spend the evenings here? They would at any rate be warm for two or three hours; and they would be company for us, too, and make us feel more lively. Ask them, and I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll refuse.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The next day Marthe met Madame Faujas in the hall and gave the invitation, which the old lady at once accepted, both for herself and her son. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m surprised she didn\u0027t make some little demur about coming,\u0027 said Mouret. \u0027I fancied that they would have required more pressing. But the Abbé is beginning to understand that he does wrong in living like a wild beast.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n In the evening Mouret took care that the table was cleared in good time, and he set out a bottle of sweet wine and a plateful of little cakes. Although he was not given to being lavish, he was anxious to show that the Rougons were not the only people who knew how things ought to be done. The tenants of the second floor came downstairs about eight o\u0027clock. Abbé Faujas was wearing a new cassock, at the sight of which Mouret was so much surprised that he could only stammer a few words in answer to the priest\u0027s courtesies. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Indeed, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé, all the honour is for us. Come, children, put some chairs here.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They all took their seats round the table. The room was uncomfortably warm, for Mouret had crammed the stove as full as possible in order to let his guests see that he made no account of a log more or less. Abbé Faujas made himself very pleasant, fondling Désirée and questioning the two lads[Pg 73] about their studies. Marthe, who was knitting some stockings, raised her eyes every now and then in surprise at the flexible tones of that strange voice which she was not accustomed to hear sounding in the monotonous quietness of the dining-room. She looked at the priest\u0027s powerful face and square-cut features, and then bent her head again, without trying to hide the interest she took in this man who was so strong and kindly and whom she knew to be so poor. As for Mouret, he uncouthly stared at the new cassock, and could not restrain himself from saying, with a sly smile: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You needn\u0027t have troubled to dress to come here, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé. We don\u0027t go in for ceremony, as you know very well.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe blushed, while the priest gaily related that he had bought the cassock that very day. He had kept it on, he said, to please his mother, who thought that he looked finer than a king in it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you, mother?\u0027 he asked the old lady. \\n\\n \\n\\n Madame Faujas nodded without taking her eyes off her son. She was sitting opposite to him, gazing at him in the bright lamplight with an air of ecstasy. \\n\\n \\n\\n They began to talk of various matters, and Abbé Faujas seemed to throw off his gloomy coldness. He still remained grave, but it was with a pleasant, good-natured gravity. He listened attentively to Mouret, replied to his most insignificant remarks, and seemed to take an interest in his gossip. His landlord explained to him the manner in which the family lived, and finished his account by saying: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We spend our evenings in the way you see, always as quietly as this. We never invite anyone, as we are always more comfortable by ourselves. Every evening I have a game at piquet with my wife. It is a very old habit of ours, and I could scarcely go to sleep without it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Pray don\u0027t let us interfere with it!\u0027 cried Abbé Faujas. \u0027I beg that you won\u0027t in any way depart from your usual habits on our account.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh dear no! I am not a monomaniac about it, and it won\u0027t kill me to go without it for once.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The priest insisted for a time, but, when he saw that Marthe declined to play with even greater determination than her husband, he turned towards his mother, who had been sitting silent with her hands folded in front of her, and said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mother, you have a game with Monsieur Mouret.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 74] \\n\\n \\n\\n She looked keenly into her son\u0027s eyes, while Mouret still continued to refuse, and declared that he did not want to break up the party. However, when the priest told him that his mother was a good player he gave way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is she, indeed?\u0027 he said. \u0027Then, if madame really wishes it, and no one objects——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Come along, mother, and have a game!\u0027 said Abbé Faujas in a more decided tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Certainly,\u0027 she replied, \u0027I shall be delighted; but I shall have to change my place.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh! there will be no difficulty about that,\u0027 said Mouret, who was quite charmed. \u0027You had better take your son\u0027s seat, and perhaps Monsieur l\u0027Abbé will be good enough to sit next to my wife. Madame can sit next to me. There! that will do capitally.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The priest, who had at first been opposite to Marthe on the other side of the table, was thus placed next to her. They sat quite apart by themselves, the two players having drawn their chairs close together to engage in their struggle. Octave and Serge had just gone up to their room. Désirée was sleeping with her head on the table after her usual custom. When ten o\u0027clock struck, Mouret, who had lost the first game, did not feel inclined to go to bed but asked for his revenge. Madame Faujas consulted her son with a glance, and then in her tranquil fashion began to shuffle the cards. The Abbé had merely exchanged a few words with Marthe. On this the first evening that he spent in the dining-room he only spoke of commonplace topics; the household, the price of victuals at Plassans, and the anxieties which children caused. Marthe replied with a show of interest, looking up every now and then with her bright glance, and importing into the conversation some of her own sedate good sense. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was nearly eleven o\u0027clock when Mouret threw down the cards with some slight irritation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I have lost again!\u0027 he said. \u0027I haven\u0027t had a single good card all the evening. Perhaps I shall have better luck to-morrow. We shall see you again, I hope, madame?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And when Abbé Faujas began to protest that they could not think of abusing the Mourets\u0027 kindness by disturbing them in this way every evening, he continued: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But you are not disturbing us at all, you are giving us pleasure. Besides, I have been defeated, and I\u0027m sure that madame can\u0027t refuse me another game.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 75] \\n\\n \\n\\n When the priest and his mother had accepted the invitation and had gone upstairs again, Mouret showed some ill-temper and began to excuse himself for having lost. He seemed quite annoyed about it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The old woman isn\u0027t as good a player as I am, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 he said to his wife; \u0027but she has got such eyes! I could really almost fancy she was cheating, upon my word I could! Well! we shall see what happens to-morrow.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n From that time the Faujases came down regularly every day to spend the evening with the Mourets. There were tremendous battles between the old lady and her landlord. She seemed to play with him, to let him win just frequently enough to prevent him from being altogether discouraged, and this made him fume with suppressed anger, for he prided himself on his skill at piquet. He used to indulge in dreams of beating her night after night for weeks in succession without ever letting her win a single game; while she ever preserved wonderful coolness, her square peasant-like face remaining quite expressionless as with her big hands she threw down the cards with all the regularity of a machine. From eight o\u0027clock till bed-time they would remain seated at their end of the table, quite absorbed in their game and never moving. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the other end, near the stove, Abbé Faujas and Marthe were left entirely to themselves. The Abbé felt a masculine and priestly disdain for woman, and in spite of himself this disdain often made itself manifest in some slightly harsh expression. On these occasions Marthe was affected by a strange feeling of anxiety. She raised her eyes with one of those sudden thrills of alarm which cause people to cast a hurried glance behind them, half expecting to see some concealed enemy raising his hand to strike. At other times, on catching sight of the Abbé\u0027s cassock, she would check herself suddenly in the midst of a laugh, and would relapse into silence, quite confused, astonished at finding herself talking so freely to a man who was so different from other men. It was a long time before there was any real intimacy between them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abbé Faujas never directly questioned Marthe about her husband, or her children, or her house; but, nevertheless, he gradually made himself acquainted with every detail of their history and manner of life. Every evening, while Mouret and Madame Faujas were contending furiously one against[Pg 76] the other, he contrived to learn some new fact. Upon one occasion he remarked that the husband and wife were surprisingly alike. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Marthe answered with a smile, \u0027when we were twenty years old we used to be taken for brother and sister; and, indeed, it was a little owing to that circumstance that we got married. People used to joke us about it, and were continually making us stand side by side, and saying what a fine couple we should make. The likeness was so striking that worthy Monsieur Compan, though he knew us quite well, hesitated to marry us.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But you are cousins, are you not?\u0027 the priest asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she replied, with a slight blush, \u0027my husband is a Macquart, and I am a Rougon.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then she kept silence for a moment or two, feeling ill at ease, for she was sure that the priest knew the history of her family which was so notorious at Plassans. The Macquarts were an illegitimate branch of the Rougons. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The most singular part of it,\u0027 she resumed, to conceal her embarrassment, \u0027is, that we both resemble our grandmother. My husband\u0027s mother transmitted the likeness to him, while in me it has sprung up again after a break, passing my father by.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the Abbé cited a similar instance in his own family. He had a sister, he said, who was the living image of her mother\u0027s grandfather. The likeness in this case had leapt over two generations. His sister, too, closely resembled the old man in her character and habits, even in her gestures and the tone of her voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It was just the same with me when I was a little girl; I often heard people say of me,\u0027 remarked Marthe, \u0027\"She\u0027s Aunt Dide all over again!\" The poor woman is now at Les Tulettes. She never had a strong head. For my part, in growing older, I have become less excitable and stronger, but I remember that when I was a child I hadn\u0027t good health at all. I used to have attacks of giddiness, and my head was filled with the strangest fancies. I often laugh now when I think of the extraordinary things I used to do.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And your husband?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh! he takes after his father, a journeyman hatter, a careful, prudent man. I should say that when we were young, though we were so much alike in face, it was quite a different matter as to our dispositions; however, as time has gone on,[Pg 77] we have grown to resemble each other very much. We were so quiet and happy in our business at Marseilles! The fifteen years I spent there taught me to find happiness in my own home, in the midst of my children.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Abbé Faujas noticed a touch of bitterness in her tone every time that he led her to speak on this subject. She was certainly happy, as she said; but he fancied that he could detect traces of old rebellion in her nervous nature, that was now calmed by the approach of her fortieth year. He imagined a little drama for himself, in which this husband and wife, who were so much alike, were considered by their relations to be made for each other, and were thus forced into marriage, whereas, in reality, they were of different and antagonistic temperaments. Then his mind dwelt upon the fatal outcome of a monotonous life, the wearing away of character by the daily cares of business, the soporific effect of fifteen years\u0027 fortune-making upon this couple, who were now living upon that fortune in a sleepy corner of a little town. To-day, though they were both still young, there seemed to be nothing but the ashes left of their former selves. The Abbé cleverly tried to discover whether Marthe was resigned to her existence, and he found her full of common sense. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am quite contented with my home,\u0027 she said; \u0027my children are all that I want. I was never much given to gaiety; I only felt a little dull at times. I dare say I should have been better if I had had some mental occupation, but I was never able to find one. And perhaps, after all, it\u0027s as well I didn\u0027t, for I should very likely have split my head. I could never even read a novel without giving myself a frightful headache, and for nights afterwards all the characters would dance about in my brain. Needlework is the only thing which never fatigues me, so I stay at home and keep out of the way of noise and chatter, and all the frivolous follies which weary me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She paused every now and then to glance at Désirée, who was still sleeping with her head upon the table, and smiling in her innocent way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Poor child!\u0027 she murmured. \u0027She can\u0027t even do any needlework. She gets dizzy directly. She is fond of animals, and that\u0027s all she\u0027s capable of. When she goes to stay with her nurse, as she does every now and then, she spends all her time in the poultry-yard, and she comes back to me with rosy cheeks and as strong and well as possible.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 78] \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe often spoke of Les Tulettes, manifesting as she did so a lurking fear of insanity, and Abbé Faujas thus became aware of a strange dread haunting this peaceful home. Marthe loved her husband with a sober, unimpassioned love, but there was mingled with her affection for him considerable fear of his jokes and pleasantries, his perpetual teasing. She was hurt, too, by his selfishness, and the loneliness in which he left her; she felt a vague grudge against him for the quietude in which she lived—that very manner of life which she said made her happy. When she spoke of him, she said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He is very good to us. You\u0027ve heard him, I dare say, get angry sometimes, but that arises from his passion for seeing everything in order, which he often carries to an almost ridiculous extent. He gets quite vexed if he sees a flower-pot a little out of place in the garden, or a plaything lying about on the floor; but in other matters he does quite right in pleasing himself. I know he is not very popular, because he has managed to accumulate some money, and still continues to do a good stroke of business every now and then; but he only laughs at what people say about him. They say nasty things, too, of him in connexion with me. They say that he is a miser, and won\u0027t let me go out anywhere, and even deprives me of boots. But all that is quite untrue. I am entirely free. He certainly prefers to see me here when he comes home, instead of finding that I am always off somewhere, paying calls and walking on the promenade. But he knows quite well what my tastes are. What, indeed, should I go out for?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n As she defended Mouret against the gossip of Plassans, Marthe\u0027s voice assumed a sudden animation, as though she felt the need of defending him quite as much from the secret accusations which arose within her own mind; and she kept reverting with nervous uneasiness to the subject of society life. She seemed to seek a refuge within the little dining-room and the old-fashioned garden with its box borders, as if everything else filled her with vague alarm, and made her doubtful of her strength, apprehensive of some possible catastrophe. Then she would smile at her fears, and shrug her shoulders as she resumed her knitting or the mending of some old skirt; and Abbé Faujas would see before him only a cold, reserved housewife, with listless face and inanimate eyes, who filled the house with a scent as of clean linen, and of blossoms gathered in the shade. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 79] \\n\\n \\n\\n Two months passed away in this manner. Abbé Faujas and his mother had become quite a part of the Mourets\u0027 family life. They all had their recognised places every evening at the table, just as the lamp had its place; and the same intervals of silence were broken night after night by the same remarks from the card-players and the same subdued converse of the priest and Marthe. When Madame Faujas had not given him too tremendous a beating Mouret found his lodgers \u0027extremely nice people.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n All that curiosity of his, born of idleness, waned before the interest and occupation that the nightly parties afforded him, and he no longer played the spy upon the Abbé, whom he declared to be a very good fellow, now that he knew him better. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, don\u0027t bother me with your stories!\u0027 he used to exclaim to those who attacked Abbé Faujas. \u0027You get hold of a pack of nonsense and put absurd interpretations upon facts that admit of the simplest explanation. I know all about him. He very kindly comes and spends his evenings with us; but he\u0027s not a man to make himself cheap, and I can quite understand that people don\u0027t like him for it and accuse him of pride.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret greatly enjoyed being the only person in Plassans who could boast of knowing Abbé Faujas, and he even somewhat abused this advantage. Every time he met Madame Rougon he put on an air of triumph and made her understand that he had stolen her guest from her, while the old lady contented herself with smiling quietly. With his intimate acquaintances Mouret extended his confidences further, and remarked that those blessed priests could do nothing like other people. Then he gave them a string of little details, and told them in what manner the Abbé drank, how he talked to women, and how he always kept his knees apart without ever crossing his legs, and other trifling matters which the vague alarm that his free-thinking mind experienced in the presence of his guest\u0027s long, mystic-looking cassock made him notice. \\n\\n \\n\\n The evenings passed away one after another, and at last the first days of February came round. In all the conversations between himself and Marthe Abbé Faujas had to all appearance carefully avoided the subject of religion. She had once remarked to him, almost lightly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé, I am not a very religious woman,[Pg 80] and I seldom go to church. At Marseilles I was always too busy, and now I am too indolent to go out. And then I must confess to you that I wasn\u0027t brought up with religious ideas. My mother used to tell me that God would come to us quite as well at home.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The priest bowed his head without making any reply, and seemed to signify that he would rather not discuss religious matters under such circumstances. One evening, however, he drew a picture of the unexpected comfort which suffering souls find in religion. They were talking of a poor woman whom troubles of every sort had driven to suicide. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027She did wrong to despair,\u0027 said the priest in his deep voice. \u0027She was ignorant of the comfort and consolation to be found in prayer. I have often seen heart-broken, weeping women come to us, and they have gone away again filled with a resignation that they had vainly sought elsewhere, and glad to live; and this had come from their falling upon their knees and tasting the blessedness of humiliating themselves before God in some quiet corner of the church. They came back there, they forgot their troubles, and became God\u0027s entirely.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe listened with a thoughtful expression to these remarks of the priest, whose last words fell in a gradually softening voice that seemed to breathe of superhuman felicity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, it must be a blessed thing,\u0027 she murmured, as though she were speaking to herself. \u0027I have thought about it sometimes, but I have always felt afraid.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n If the Abbé seldom referred to such matters as this, he frequently spoke on the subject of charity. Marthe was very tender-hearted, and tears rose to her eyes at the slightest tale of trouble. It seemed to please the priest to see her so moved to pity; and every evening he told her some fresh story of sorrow, and kept her constantly excited with compassion. She would let her work fall, and clasp her hands as, with a sad, pitying face, she gazed into his eyes and listened to him as he recounted heart-rending details of how some poor persons had died of starvation, or how others had been goaded by misery into committing base crimes. At these times she fell completely under his influence, and he might have done what he willed with her. \\n\\n \\n\\n About the middle of February a deplorable occurrence threw Plassans into dismay. It was discovered that a number[Pg 81] of young girls, scarcely more than children, had fallen into evil courses while loafing about the streets, and it was even rumoured that some persons of high position in the town would be compromised. For a week Marthe was very painfully affected by this discovery, which caused the greatest sensation. She was acquainted with one of the unfortunate girls, who was the niece of her cook, Rose; and she could not think of the poor little creature without shuddering. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is a great pity,\u0027 said Abbé Faujas to her one evening, \u0027that there isn\u0027t a Home at Plassans on the model of the one at Besan?on.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, in reply to Marthe\u0027s pressing questions, the Abbé explained to her the constitution of this Home. It was a sort of refuge for girls from eight to fifteen years of age, the daughters of working men, whose parents were obliged to leave them alone during the day while they themselves went to their employment. During the day-time these girls were set to do needlework, and in the evening they were sent back to their parents, the latter having then returned home from their work. By this system the children were brought up out of the reach of vice and in the midst of good examples. Marthe thought the idea an admirable one, and she gradually became so prepossessed in its favour that she could talk of nothing else than the necessity of founding a similar institution at Plassans. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We might put it under the patronage of the Virgin,\u0027 Abbé Faujas suggested. \u0027But there are such difficulties in the way! You have no idea of the trouble there is in effecting the least good work! What is quite essential to the success of such a scheme as this is some woman with a motherly heart, full of zeal and absolutely devoted to the work.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe lowered her head and looked at Désirée, who was asleep by her side, and she felt tears welling from beneath her eyelids. She made inquiries as to the steps that it would be necessary to take for founding such a Home, the cost of erecting it, and the annual expenses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Will you help me?\u0027 she suddenly asked the priest one evening. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abbé Faujas gravely took her hand and held it within his own for a moment, telling her that she had one of the fairest souls he had ever known. He would willingly do what he could, he assured her, but he should rely altogether upon her, for the assistance that he himself would be able to give[Pg 82] would be small. It would be for her to form a committee of the ladies of the town, to collect subscriptions, and to take upon herself, in a word, all the delicate and onerous duties which are connected with an appeal to the charity of the public. He appointed a meeting with her for the following day at Saint-Saturnin\u0027s to introduce her to the diocesan architect, who would be able to tell her much better than he himself could do about the expenses that would have to be incurred. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret was very gay that evening when they went to bed. He had not allowed Madame Faujas to win a single game. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You seem quite pleased about something to-night, my dear,\u0027 he said to his wife. \u0027Did you see what a beating I gave the old lady downstairs?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then as he observed Marthe taking a silk dress out of her wardrobe, he asked her with some surprise if she intended to go out in the morning. He had not heard anything of the conversation in the dining-room between his wife and the priest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she replied, \u0027I have to go out. I have to meet Abbé Faujas at the church about a matter which I will tell you of.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He stood motionless in front of her, and gazed at her with an expression of stupefaction, wondering if she were not really jesting with him. Then, without any appearance of displeasure, he said in his bantering fashion: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Hallo! hallo! well I never expected that! So you\u0027ve gone over to the priests now!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58405.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
