{"id":29435,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER 12","content":"At the return of summer Abbé Faujas and his mother again came downstairs to enjoy the fresh air on the terrace. Mouret had become very cross-grained. He declined the old lady\u0027s[Pg 134] invitations to play piquet and sat swaying himself about on a chair. Seeing him yawn, without making any attempt to conceal how bored he was feeling, Marthe said to him: \n \n \u0027Why don\u0027t you go to your club, my dear?\u0027 \n \n He now went there more frequently than he had been used to do. When he returned he found his wife and the Abbé still in the same place on the terrace, while Madame Faujas, a few yards away from them, preserved the demeanour of a blind and dumb guardian. \n \n When anyone in the town spoke to Mouret of the new Curé he still continued to sound his praises. Faujas, said he, was decidedly a superior sort of man, and he himself had never felt any doubt of his great abilities. Madame Paloque could never succeed in drawing a hostile word from him on the subject of the priest, in spite of the malicious way in which she would ask him after his wife in the midst of his remarks about Abbé Faujas. Old Madame Rougon had no better success in her attempts to unveil the secret troubles which she thought she could detect beneath Mouret\u0027s outward show of cheerfulness. She laid all sorts of traps for him as she watched his face with her sharp shrewd smile; but that inveterate chatterer, whose tongue was a regular town-crier\u0027s bell, now showed the greatest reserve when any reference was made to his household. \n \n \u0027So your husband has become reasonable at last?\u0027 Félicité remarked to her daughter one day. \u0027He leaves you free.\u0027 \n \n Marthe looked at her mother with an air of surprise. \n \n \u0027I have always been free,\u0027 she said. \n \n \u0027Ah! my dear child, I see that you don\u0027t want to say anything against him. You told me once that he looked very unfavourably upon Abbé Faujas.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Nothing of the kind, I assure you! You must have imagined it. My husband is upon the best terms with Abbé Faujas. There is nothing whatever to make them otherwise.\u0027 \n \n Marthe was much astonished at the persistence with which everybody seemed to imagine that her husband and the Abbé were not good friends. Frequently at the committee-meetings at the Home of the Virgin the ladies put questions to her which made her quite impatient. She was really very happy and contented, and the house in the Rue Balande had never seemed pleasanter to her than it did now. Abbé Faujas had given her to understand that he would undertake her spiritual[Pg 135] direction as soon as he should be of opinion that Abbé Bourrette was no longer sufficient, and she lived in this hope, her mind full of simple joy, like a girl who is promised some pretty religious pictures if she keeps good. Every now and then indeed she felt as though she were becoming a child again; she experienced a freshness of feeling and child-like impulses that filled her with gentle emotion. One day, in the spring-time, as Mouret was pruning his tall box plants, he found her sitting at the bottom of the garden beneath the young shoots of the arbour with her eyes streaming with tears. \n \n \u0027What is the matter, my dear?\u0027 he asked anxiously. \n \n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 she said, with a smile, \u0027nothing at all, really; I am very happy, very.\u0027 \n \n He shrugged his shoulders, and went on delicately cutting the box plants into an even line. He took considerable pride in having the neatest trimmed hedges in the neighbourhood. Marthe had wiped her eyes, but she soon began to weep again, feeling a choking heart-rending sensation at the scent of the severed verdure. She was forty years old now, and it was for her past-away youth that she was weeping. \n \n Since his appointment as Curé of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s, Abbé Faujas had shown a dignity which seemed to increase his stature. He carried his breviary and his hat with an air of authority, which he had exhibited at the cathedral in such wise as to ensure himself the respect of the clergy. Abbé Fenil, having sustained another defeat on two or three matters of detail, now seemed to have left his adversary free to do as he pleased. Abbé Faujas, however, was not foolish enough to make any indiscreet use of his triumph, but showed himself extremely supple. He was quite conscious that Plassans was still far from being his; and so, though he stopped every now and then in the street to shake hands with Monsieur Delangre, he merely exchanged passing salutations with Monsieur de Bourdeu, Monsieur Maffre, and the other guests of Monsieur Rastoil. A large section of society in the town still looked upon him with suspicion. They found fault with him for the want of frankness in his political opinions. In their estimation he ought to explain himself, declare himself in favour of one party or another. But the Abbé only smiled and said that he belonged to \u0027the honest men\u0027s party,\u0027 a reply which spared him a more explicit declaration. Moreover he showed no haste or anxiety, but continued to keep[Pg 136] aloof till the drawing-rooms should open their doors to him of their own accord. \n \n \u0027No, my friend, not now; later on we will see about it,\u0027 he said to Abbé Bourrette, who had been pressing him to pay a visit to Monsieur Rastoil. \n \n He was known to have refused two invitations to the Sub-Prefecture, and the Mourets were still the only people with whom he continued intimate. There he was, as it were, occupying a post of observation between two hostile camps. On Tuesdays, when the two sets of guests assembled in the gardens on his right and left, he took up his position at his window and watched the sunset in the distance behind the forests of the Seille, and then, before withdrawing, he lowered his eyes and replied with as much amiability to the bows of Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s guests as to those of the Sub-Prefect\u0027s. His intercourse with his neighbours as yet went no further than this. \n \n On Tuesday, however, he went down into the garden. He was quite at home now in Mouret\u0027s grounds and no longer confined himself to pacing up and down beneath the arbour as he read his breviary. All the walks and beds seemed to belong to him; his cassock glided blackly past all the greenery. On that particular Tuesday, as he made a tour of the garden, he caught sight of Monsieur Maffre and Madame Rastoil below him and bowed to them; and then as he passed below the terrace of the Sub-Prefecture, he saw Monsieur de Condamin leaning there in company with Doctor Porquier. After an exchange of salutations, the priest was turning along the path, when the doctor called to him. \n \n \u0027Just a word, your reverence, I beg.\u0027 \n \n Then he asked him at what time he could see him the following day. This was the first occasion on which any one of the two sets of guests had spoken to the priest from one garden to the other. The doctor was in great trouble however. His scamp of a son had been caught in a gambling den behind the gaol in company with other worthless characters. The most distressing part of the matter was that Guillaume was accused of being the leader of the band, and of having led Monsieur Maffre\u0027s sons, much younger than himself, astray. \n \n \u0027Pooh!\u0027 said Monsieur de Condamin with his sceptical laugh; \u0027young men must sow their wild oats. What a fuss about nothing! Here\u0027s the whole town in a state of perturbation[Pg 137] because some young fellows have been caught playing baccarat and there happened to be a lady with them!\u0027 \n \n The doctor seemed very much shocked at this. \n \n \u0027I want to ask your advice,\u0027 he said, addressing himself to the priest. \u0027Monsieur Maffre came to my house boiling over with anger, and assailed me with the bitterest reproaches, crying out that it was all my fault, as I had brought my son up badly. I am extremely distressed and troubled about it. Monsieur Maffre ought to know me better. I have sixty years of stainless life behind me.\u0027 \n \n He went on wailing, dwelling upon the sacrifices that he had made for his son and expressing his fears that he would lose his practice in consequence of the young man\u0027s misconduct. Abbé Faujas, standing in the middle of the path, raised his head and gravely listened. \n \n \u0027I shall be only too glad if I can be of any service to you,\u0027 he said kindly. \u0027I will see Monsieur Maffre and will let him understand that his natural indignation has carried him too far. I will go at once and ask him to appoint a meeting with me for to-morrow. He is over there, on the other side.\u0027 \n \n The Abbé crossed the garden and went towards Monsieur Maffre, who was still there with Madame Rastoil. When the justice of the peace found that the priest desired an interview with him, he would not hear of his taking any trouble about it, but put himself at his disposition, saying that he would do himself the honour of calling upon him the next day. \n \n \u0027Ah! Monsieur le Curé,\u0027 Madame Rastoil then remarked, \u0027let me compliment you upon your sermon last Sunday. All the ladies were much affected by it, I assure you.\u0027 \n \n The Abbé bowed and crossed the garden again in order to reassure Doctor Porquier. Then he continued slowly pacing about the walks till nightfall, without taking part in any further conversations, but ever hearing the merriment of the groups of guests on his right hand and his left. \n \n When Monsieur Maffre appeared the next day, Abbé Faujas was watching a couple of men who were at work repairing the fountain in the garden. He had expressed a desire to see the fountain play again, for the empty basin, said he, had such a melancholy appearance. At first Mouret had not seemed very willing to have anything done, alleging the probability of accidents with Désirée, but Marthe had prevailed upon him to let the repairs be executed upon the understanding that the basin should be protected by a railing. \n \n [Pg 138] \n \n \u0027Monsieur le Curé,\u0027 said Rose, \u0027the justice of the peace wishes to see you.\u0027 \n \n Abbé Faujas hastened indoors. He wanted to take Monsieur Maffre up to his own room on the second floor, but Rose had already opened the drawing-room door. \n \n \u0027Go in,\u0027 she said; \u0027aren\u0027t you at home here? It is useless to make the justice go up two flights of stairs. If you had only told me this morning, I would have given the room a dusting.\u0027 \n \n As she closed the door upon the Abbé and the magistrate, after opening the shutters, Mouret called her into the dining-room. \n \n \u0027That\u0027s right, Rose,\u0027 he cried, \u0027you had better give my dinner to your priest this evening, and if he hasn\u0027t got sufficient blankets of his own upstairs you can take mine off my bed.\u0027 \n \n The cook exchanged a meaning glance with Marthe, who was working by the window, waiting till the sunshine should leave the terrace. Then, shrugging her shoulders, she said: \n \n \u0027Ah! sir, you have never had a charitable heart!\u0027 \n \n She took herself off, while Marthe continued sewing without raising her head. For the last few days she had, with feverish energy, again applied herself to her needlework. She was embroidering an altar-frontal as a gift for the cathedral. The ladies were desirous of giving a complete set of altar furniture. Madame Rastoil and Madame Delangre had undertaken to present the candlesticks, and Madame de Condamin had ordered a magnificent silver crucifix from Paris. \n \n Meantime, in the drawing-room, Abbé Faujas was gently remonstrating with Monsieur Maffre, telling him that Doctor Porquier was a religious man and a person of the highest integrity, and that no one could be more pained than he by his son\u0027s deplorable conduct. The magistrate listened with a sanctimonious air, and his heavy features and big prominent eyes assumed quite an ecstatic expression at certain pious remarks which the priest uttered in a very moving manner. He allowed that he had been rather too hasty, and declared that he was willing to make every apology as his reverence thought he had been in the wrong. \n \n \u0027You must send your own sons to me,\u0027 said the priest, \u0027and I will talk to them.\u0027 \n \n Monsieur Maffre shook his head with a slight sneering laugh. \n \n [Pg 139] \n \n \u0027Oh! you needn\u0027t be afraid about them, Monsieur le Curé. The young scamps won\u0027t play any more tricks. They have been locked up in their rooms for the last three days with nothing but bread and water. If I had had a stick in my hand when I found out what they had been doing, I should have broken it across their backs.\u0027 \n \n The Abbé looked at him and recollected how Mouret had accused him of having killed his wife by harshness and avarice; then, with a gesture of protest, he added: \n \n \u0027No, no; that is not the way to treat young men. Your elder son, Ambroise, is twenty years old and the younger is nearly eighteen, isn\u0027t he? They are no longer children, remember. You must allow them some amusements.\u0027 \n \n The magistrate remained silent with surprise. \n \n \u0027Then you would let them go on smoking and allow them to frequent cafés?\u0027 he said, presently. \n \n \u0027Well,\u0027 replied the priest, with a smile. \u0027I think that young men should be allowed to meet together to talk and smoke their cigarettes and even to play a game of billiards or chess. They will give themselves every license if you show no tolerance. Only remember that it is not to every café that I should be willing for them to go. I should like to see a special one provided for them, a sort of club, as I have seen done in several towns.\u0027 \n \n Then he unfolded a complete scheme for such a club. Monsieur Maffre gradually seemed to appreciate it. He nodded his head as he said: \n \n \u0027Capital, capital! It would be a worthy pendant to the Home of the Virgin. Really, Monsieur le Curé, we must put such a splendid idea as this into execution.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Well, then,\u0027 the priest concluded, as he accompanied Monsieur Maffre to the door, \u0027since you approve of the plan, just advocate it among your friends. I will see Monsieur Delangre, and speak to him about it. We might meet in the cathedral on Sunday after vespers and come to some decision.\u0027 \n \n On the Sunday, Monsieur Maffre brought Monsieur Rastoil with him. They found Abbé Faujas and Monsieur Delangre in a little room adjoining the sacristy. The gentlemen displayed great enthusiasm in favour of the priest\u0027s idea, and the institution of a young men\u0027s club was agreed upon in principle. There was considerable discussion, however, as to what it should be called. Monsieur Maffre was strongly desirous that it should be known as the Guild of Jesus. \n \n [Pg 140] \n \n \u0027Oh, no! no!\u0027 the priest impatiently cried at last. \u0027You would get scarcely anyone to join, and the few members would only be jeered at. There must be no attempt to tack religion on to the business; indeed, I intend that we should leave religion outside its doors altogether. All we want to do is to win the young people over to our side by providing them with some innocent recreation; that is all.\u0027 \n \n The justice of the peace gazed at the priest with such an expression of astonishment and anxiety that Monsieur Delangre was obliged to bend his head to conceal a smile, while he slyly pulled the Abbé\u0027s cassock. Then the priest went on in a calmer voice: \n \n \u0027I am sure, gentlemen, that you do not feel any distrust of me, and I ask you to leave the management of the matter in my hands. I propose to adopt some very simple name, such a one, for instance, as the Young Men\u0027s Club, which fully expresses all that is required.\u0027 \n \n Monsieur Rastoil and Monsieur Maffre bowed, although this title seemed to them a little weak. They next spoke of nominating the Curé as president of a provisional committee. \n \n \u0027I fancy,\u0027 said Monsieur Delangre, glancing at the priest, \u0027that this suggestion will scarcely meet with his reverence\u0027s approbation.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh dear, no!\u0027 the Abbé exclaimed, slightly shrugging his shoulders. \u0027My cassock would frighten the timid and lukewarm away. We should only get the pious young people, and it is not for them that we are going to found our club. What we want is to gather in the wanderers; to win converts, in a word; isn\u0027t that so?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Clearly,\u0027 replied the presiding judge. \n \n \u0027Very well, then, it will be better for us to keep ourselves in the background, myself especially. What I propose is this: your son, Monsieur Rastoil, and yours, Monsieur Delangre, will alone come forward. It must appear as if they themselves had formed the idea of this club. Send them to me in the morning, and I will talk the matter over at length with them. I already have a suitable building in my mind and a code of rules quite prepared. Your two sons, Monsieur Maffre, will naturally be enrolled at the head of the list of members.\u0027 \n \n The presiding judge seemed flattered at the part assigned to his son; and so matters were arranged in this way, notwithstanding the resistance of the justice of the peace, who[Pg 141] had hoped to win some personal distinction from the founding of the club. The next day Séverin Rastoil and Lucien Delangre put themselves in communication with Abbé Faujas. Séverin was a tall young man of five-and-twenty, with a badly shaped skull and a dull brain, who had just been called to the bar, thanks to the position which his father held. The latter was anxiously dreaming of making him a public prosecutor\u0027s assessor, despairing of his ever succeeding in winning any practice for himself. Lucien, on the other hand, was short and sharp-eyed, had a crafty mind, and pleaded with all the coolness of an old practitioner, although he was a year younger than Séverin. The \u0027Plassans Gazette\u0027 spoke of him as a future light of the bar. It was more particularly to him that the Abbé gave the minutest instructions as to his scheme. As for young Rastoil he simply went fussing about, bursting with importance. In three weeks the Young Men\u0027s Club was founded and opened. \n \n There was at that time beneath the church of the Minimes, situated at the end of the Cours Sauvaire, a number of very large rooms and an old monastery refectory, which were no longer put to any use. This was the place that Abbé Faujas had thought of for the club, and the clergy of the parish very willingly allowed him to use the rooms. One morning, when the provisional committee of the Young Men\u0027s Club had set workmen going in this cellar-like place, the citizens of Plassans were quite astounded to see what appeared to be a café being fitted up under the church. Five days afterwards there was no longer any room for doubt on the point. The place was certainly going to be a café. Divans were being brought thither, with marble-topped tables, chairs, two billiard-tables, and even three crates of crockery and glass. An entrance was contrived at the end of the building, as far as possible from the doorway of the church, and great crimson curtains, genuine restaurant-curtains, were hung behind the glass panes. You descended five stone steps, and on opening the door found yourself in a large hall; to the right of which there was a smaller one and a reading-room, while in a square room at the far end were placed the two billiard-tables. They were exactly beneath the high altar. \n \n \u0027Well, my poor boys,\u0027 said Guillaume Porquier one day to Monsieur Maffre\u0027s two sons, whom he had met on the Cours, \u0027so they are going to make you serve at mass between your games at bézique.\u0027 \n \n [Pg 142] \n \n However, Ambroise and Alphonse besought him not to speak to them in public, as their father had threatened to send them to sea if they continued to associate with him. \n \n When the first astonishment was over, the Young Men\u0027s Club proved a great success. Monseigneur Rousselot accepted the honorary presidency, and even visited it in person one evening, attended by his secretary, Abbé Surin. Each of them drank a glass of currant-syrup in the smaller room, and the glass which his lordship used was preserved with great respect upon a sideboard. The Bishop\u0027s visit is still talked of with much emotion at Plassans, and it brought about the adherence of all the fashionable young men of the town. It was soon considered very bad style not to belong to the Young Men\u0027s Club. \n \n Guillaume Porquier, however, used to prowl about the entrance, sniggering like a young wolf who dreams of making his way into a sheep-fold. Notwithstanding all the fear they had of their father, Monsieur Maffre\u0027s sons quite worshipped this shameless young man who regaled them with stories of Paris, and entertained them at secret little parties in the suburbs. They had got into the habit of meeting him regularly every Saturday evening at nine o\u0027clock near a certain seat on the Mall. They slipped away from the club and sat gossiping till eleven, concealed beneath the dark shade of the plane-trees. On these occasions Guillaume always twitted them about the evenings they spent underneath the church of the Minimes. \n \n \u0027It is very kind of you,\u0027 he, would say, \u0027to let yourselves be led by the nose. The verger gives you glasses of sugar and water as though he were administering the communion to you, doesn\u0027t he?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Nothing of the sort! you are quite mistaken, I assure you,\u0027 Ambroise exclaimed. \u0027You might fancy you were in the Café du Cours, or the Café de France, or the Café des Voyageurs. We drink beer, or punch, or madeira, whatever we like, whatever is drunk in other places.\u0027 \n \n Guillaume continued jeering however. \n \n \u0027Well, I shouldn\u0027t like to go drinking their dirty stuff,\u0027 he said. \u0027I should be afraid that they had mixed some drug with it to make me go to confession. I suppose you amuse yourselves by playing at hot-cockles and puss-in-the-corner!\u0027 \n \n The young Maffres gaily laughed at his pleasantries, but they took care to undeceive him. They told him that even[Pg 143] cards were allowed, and that there was no flavour of a church about the place at all. The club was extremely pleasant, there were very comfortable couches, and mirrors all over. \n \n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Guillaume, \u0027you\u0027ll never make me believe that you can\u0027t hear the organ when there is an evening service at the church. It would make me swallow my coffee the wrong way only to know that there was a baptism, or a marriage, or a funeral going on over my cup.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Well, there\u0027s something in that,\u0027 Alphonse allowed. \u0027Only the other day, while I was playing at billiards with Séverin in the day-time, we could distinctly hear a funeral going on. It was the funeral of the butcher\u0027s little girl, the butcher at the corner of the Rue de la Banne. That fellow Séverin is a big jackass, he tried to frighten me by telling me that the whole funeral would fall through on our heads.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Ah well! it must be a very pleasant place, that club of yours!\u0027 cried Guillaume. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t set foot in it for all the money in the world! I\u0027d as soon go and drink my coffee in a sacristy.\u0027 \n \n The truth of the matter was that Guillaume felt very much vexed that he did not belong to the Young Men\u0027s Club. His father had forbidden him to offer himself for election, fearing that he would be rejected. At last, however, the young man grew so annoyed about the matter that he sent in an application to be allowed to join the club, without mentioning what he had done to his people. The question was a very serious one. The committee which elected the members then comprised the young Maffres amongst its number, and Lucien Delangre was its president and Séverin Rastoil its secretary. These young men felt terribly embarrassed. While they did not dare to grant Guillaume\u0027s application, they were unwilling to do anything to hurt the feelings of Doctor Porquier, so worthy and irreproachable a person, one, too, who was so completely trusted by all the fashionable ladies. At last Ambroise and Alphonse begged Guillaume not to press his application, giving him to understand that he had no chance of being admitted. \n \n \u0027You are a couple of pitiful poltroons!\u0027 he replied to them. \u0027Do you suppose that I care a fig about joining your brotherhood? I was only amusing myself. I wanted to see if you would have the courage to vote against me. I shall have a good laugh when those hypocrites bang the door in my face.[Pg 144] As for you, my good little boys, you can go and amuse yourselves where you like; I shall never speak to you again.\u0027 \n \n The young Maffres, in great consternation, then besought Lucien Delangre to try to arrange matters in such a way as would prevent any unpleasantness. Lucien submitted the difficulty to his usual adviser, Abbé Faujas, for whom he had conceived a genuine disciple\u0027s admiration. The Abbé came to the Young Men\u0027s Club every afternoon from five o\u0027clock till six. He walked through the big room with a pleasant smile, nodding and sometimes stopping for a few minutes at one of the tables to chat with some of the young men. However, he never accepted anything to drink, not even a glass of water. Afterwards he passed into the reading-room, and, taking a seat at the long table covered with a green cloth, he attentively pored over the newspapers which the club received, the Legitimist organs of Paris and the neighbouring departments. Occasionally he made a rapid note in a little pocket-book. Then he went quietly away, again smiling at the members who were present, and shaking hands with them. On some occasions, however, he remained for a longer time to watch a game at chess, or chat merrily about all kinds of matters. The young men, who were extremely fond of him, used to say that when he talked no one would take him for a priest. \n \n When the mayor\u0027s son told him of the embarrassment which Guillaume\u0027s application had caused the committee, Abbé Faujas promised to arrange the affair; and next morning he went to see Doctor Porquier, to whom he related everything. The doctor was aghast. His son, he cried, was determined to kill him with distress by dishonouring his grey hairs. What could be done now? Even if the application were withdrawn, the shame and disgrace would be none the less. The priest then advised him to send Guillaume away for two or three months to an estate which he possessed a few leagues from Plassans, and undertook to charge himself with the further conduct of the affair. As soon as Guillaume had left the town, the committee postponed the consideration of his application, saying that there was no occasion for haste in the matter, as the applicant was absent and that a decision could be taken later on. \n \n Doctor Porquier heard of this solution from Lucien Delangre one afternoon when he was in the garden of the Sub-Prefecture. He immediately hastened to the terrace. It[Pg 145] was the hour when Abbé Faujas read his breviary. Doctor Porquier caught sight of him under the Mourets\u0027 arbour. \n \n \u0027Ah, Monsieur le Curé!\u0027 he cried, \u0027how can I thank you? I should like very much to shake hands with you.\u0027 \n \n \u0027The wall is rather high,\u0027 said the priest, looking at it with a smile. \n \n But Doctor Porquier was an effusive individual who did not allow himself to be discouraged by obstacles. \n \n \u0027Wait a moment!\u0027 he cried. \u0027If you will allow me, Monsieur le Curé, I will come round.\u0027 \n \n Then he disappeared. The Abbé, still smiling, slowly bent his steps towards the little door which opened into the Impasse des Chevillottes. The doctor was already gently knocking at it. \n \n \u0027Ah! this door is nailed up,\u0027 said the priest. \u0027One of the nails is broken though. If I had any sort of a tool, there would be no difficulty in getting the other one out.\u0027 \n \n He glanced round him and caught sight of a spade. Then, after he had drawn back the bolts with a slight effort, he opened the door, and stepped out into the alley, where Doctor Porquier overwhelmed him with thanks and compliments. As they walked along, talking, Monsieur Maffre, who happened at the time to be in Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s garden, opened a little door that was hidden away behind the presiding judge\u0027s waterfall. The gentlemen were much amused to find themselves all three in this deserted little lane. \n \n They remained there for a few moments, and, as they took leave of the Abbé, the magistrate and the doctor poked their heads inside the Mourets\u0027 garden, looking about them with curiosity. \n \n Mouret, however, who was putting stakes to his tomatoes, raised his head and caught sight of them. He was fairly lost in astonishment. \n \n \u0027Hallo! so they\u0027ve made their way in here!\u0027 he muttered. \u0027The Curé now only has to bring in both gangs!\u0027 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58410.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
