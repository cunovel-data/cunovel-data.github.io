{"id":29432,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER 9","content":"The month of April was very mild and warm, and in the evenings, after dinner, the young Mourets went to amuse themselves in the garden. Marthe and the priest, too, as they found the dining-room become very close, also went out on to the terrace. They sat a few steps from the open window, just outside the stream of light which the lamp cast upon the tall box hedges. Hid there in the deepening dusk, they discussed all the little details connected with the Home of the Virgin. This constant discussion of charitable matters seemed to give a tone of additional softness to their conversation. In front of them, between Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s huge pear-trees and the dusky chestnuts of the Sub-Prefecture, there was a large patch of open sky. The young people sported about under the arbours, while every now and then the voices of Mouret and Madame Faujas, who remained alone in the dining-room, deeply absorbed in their game, could be heard raised in passing altercations. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sometimes Marthe, full of tender emotion, a gentle languor that made her words fall slowly from her lips, would check her speech as she caught sight of the golden train of some shooting star, and smile as she threw back her head a little and looked up at the heavens. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s another soul leaving purgatory and entering paradise!\u0027 she murmured, while, as the priest kept silent, she added: \u0027How pretty they are, those little beliefs! One ought to be able to remain a little girl, your reverence.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She no longer now mended the family linen in the evening. She would have had to light a lamp on the terrace to see to do it, and she preferred the gloom of the warm night, which seemed to thrill her with peaceful happiness. Besides, she now went out every day, which fatigued her, and when dinner was over she had not energy enough to take up her needle. Rose had been obliged to undertake the mending, as Mouret was beginning to complain that his socks were all in holes. \\n\\n \\n\\n To tell the truth Marthe was really very much occupied. Besides the committee meetings over which she presided, she had numerous other things to attend to, visits to make, and[Pg 96] superintendence duties to exercise. She deputed much necessary writing and other little matters to Madame Paloque; but she was so eager to see the Home actually established, that she went off to the Faubourg, where the building stood, three times a week, to make sure that the workmen were not wasting their time. Whenever she thought that satisfactory progress was not being made, she hurried to Saint-Saturnin\u0027s to find the architect, and grumbled to him and begged him not to leave the men without his supervision, growing quite jealous, indeed, of the work which was being executed in the church, and saying that the chapel repairs were being much too quickly pushed forward. Monsieur Lieutaud smiled at all this, and assured her that everything would be completed within the stipulated time. But Abbé Faujas likewise protested that sufficient progress was not being made, and urged Marthe to give the architect no peace, so she ended by going to Saint-Saturnin\u0027s every day. \\n\\n \\n\\n She went thither with her brain full of figures, or absorbed in thinking of walls that had to be pulled down and rebuilt. The chilliness of the church cooled her excitement a little. She dipped her fingers in the holy water and crossed herself, by way of doing as others did. The vergers grew to know her and bow to her, and she herself became quite familiar with the different chapels and the sacristy, whither she sometimes had to go in search of Abbé Faujas, and the wide corridor and low cloisters through which she had to pass. At the end of a month there was not a corner in Saint-Saturnin\u0027s which she did not know. Sometimes she had to wait for the architect, and then she would sit down in some retired chapel and rest after her hurried walk, recapitulating in her mind the host of things which she wanted to impress upon Monsieur Lieutaud. The deep, palpitating silence which surrounded her, and the dim religious light falling from the stained-glass windows, gradually plunged her into a vague, soft reverie. She began to love the lofty arches and the solemn bareness of the walls, the altars draped in protecting covers, and the chairs all arranged in order. As soon, indeed, as the padded doors swung to behind her, she began to experience a feeling of supreme restfulness, she forgot all the weary cares of the world, and perfect peace permeated her being. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Saint-Saturnin\u0027s is such a pleasant place,\u0027 she said in an unguarded moment one evening before her husband, after a close, sultry day. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 97] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Would you like us to go and sleep there?\u0027 Mouret asked, with a laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe felt hurt. The feeling of purely physical happiness which she experienced in the church began to distress her as being something wrong; and it was with a slight feeling of trouble that she thenceforward entered Saint-Saturnin\u0027s, trying to force herself to remain indifferent and uninfluenced by her surroundings, just as she would have been in the big rooms at the town hall. But in spite of herself she was deeply, distressfully affected. It was, however, a distress to which she willingly returned. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abbé Faujas manifested no consciousness of the slow awakening which every day went on within her. He still retained with her the demeanour of a busy, obliging man, putting heaven on one side. He never showed anything of the priest. Sometimes, however, she would disturb him as he was going to read the burial office; and he would then speak to her for a moment between a couple of pillars in his surplice which exhaled a vague odour of incense and wax tapers. It was frequently a mere bricklayer\u0027s bill or some carpenter\u0027s claim that they spoke about, and the priest would just tell her the exact figures and then hurry away to attend to the funeral; she remaining there, lingering in the empty nave, while one of the vergers was extinguishing the candles. As Faujas, when he crossed the church with her, bowed before the high altar, she had acquired the habit of doing likewise, at first out of a feeling of mere propriety. But afterwards the action had become mechanical, and she now bowed when she was quite alone. Hitherto this act of reverence had been her only sign of devotion. Two or three times she had come to the church on days of high ceremonial of which she had not previously been aware: but when she saw the church was full of worshippers and heard the pealing of the organ, she hurried off, thrilled with sudden fear and not daring to cross the threshold. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well!\u0027 Mouret would frequently ask her with his sniggering laugh, \u0027when do you mean to take your first communion?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He was perpetually teasing her, but she never replied, simply fixing upon him the gaze of her eyes, in which a passing brightness glistened when he went too far. By degrees he became more bitter, he was tired of mocking at her; and at the end of a month he quite lost his temper. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 98] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What sense is there in going and mixing yourself up with a lot of priests?\u0027 he would growl at times when his dinner was not ready when he wanted it. \u0027You are always away from home now, there\u0027s no keeping you in the house for an hour at a time! I shouldn\u0027t mind it myself, if everything weren\u0027t going to pieces here. I never get any of my things mended, the table is not even laid by seven o\u0027clock, there\u0027s no making anything out of Rose, and the whole place is left to rack and ruin.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He picked up a house-cloth that was lying about, locked up a bottle of wine that had been left out, and began to wipe the dust off the furniture with his fingers, working himself up to a higher pitch of anger as he cried: \u0027There\u0027ll soon be nothing left for me to do but to take up a broom and put an apron on! You would see me do it without disturbing yourself, I know! I might do all the work of the house without your being any the wiser for it indeed! Do you know that I spent a couple of hours this morning in putting this cupboard in order? No, no, things can\u0027t go on any longer in this way!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n At other times there was a disturbance about the children. Once when Mouret came home he found Désirée \u0027wallowing like a young pig\u0027 in the garden, lying on her stomach before an ant-hole, and trying to find out what the ants might be doing in the ground. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We may be very thankful, I\u0027m sure, that you don\u0027t sleep away from the house as well!\u0027 he cried as soon as he caught sight of his wife. \u0027Come and look at your daughter! I wouldn\u0027t let her change her dress because I wished that you might see what a pretty sight she is.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The girl cried bitterly while her father kept turning her round. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look at her now! Isn\u0027t she a nice spectacle? This is the way children go on when they are left to themselves! It isn\u0027t her fault, poor little innocent! At one time you couldn\u0027t leave her alone for five minutes: she would be getting into the fire, you said! Well, I expect she will be getting into the fire now, and everything will be burnt up, and then there\u0027ll be an end of it all!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n When Rose had taken Désirée away, he continued: \u0027You live now simply for other people\u0027s children. You don\u0027t give a moment to your own! What a goose you must be to go knocking yourself up for a parcel of hussies who only[Pg 99] laugh at you! Go and walk about the ramparts any evening and you will see something of the conduct of those impudent creatures whom you talk of putting under the protection of the Virgin!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He stopped to take breath and then went on again: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027At all events see that Désirée is properly taken care of before you go picking up girls from the gutter! There are holes as big as my fist in her dress. One of these days we shall be finding her in the garden with a leg or an arm broken. I don\u0027t say anything about Octave or Serge, though I should much prefer your being at home when they come back from college. They are up to all kinds of diabolical tricks. Only yesterday they split a couple of flag-stones on the terrace by letting off crackers. I tell you that if you don\u0027t keep yourself at home we shall find the whole house blown to bits one of these days!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe said a few words in self-defence. She had been obliged to go out, she urged. There was no doubt that Mouret, who possessed an ample fund of common sense, in spite of his proclivities for teasing and jeering, was right. The house was getting into a most unsatisfactory state. That once quiet spot indeed, where the sun had set so peacefully, was becoming uproarious, left to look after itself, suffering from the children\u0027s noisiness, the father\u0027s bursts of temper, and the mother\u0027s careless, indifferent lassitude. In the evening, at table, they dined badly and quarrelled amongst themselves. Rose did just what she liked, and she, by the way, was of opinion that her mistress was quite in the right. \\n\\n \\n\\n Matters came to such a pass at last that Mouret, happening to meet his mother-in-law, complained to her bitterly of Marthe\u0027s conduct, although he was quite aware of the pleasure he afforded the old lady by revealing to her the troubles of his home. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You astonish me extremely!\u0027 Félicité replied with a smile. \u0027Marthe always seemed to me to be afraid of you, and I considered her even too yielding and obedient. A woman ought not to tremble before her husband.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah, yes, indeed!\u0027 cried Mouret, with a hopeless look, \u0027once upon a time she would have sunk into the ground to avoid a quarrel; a mere glance was sufficient to make her do everything I desired. But that\u0027s all quite altered now. I may remonstrate and shout as much as I like, she still goes her own way. She doesn\u0027t reply, she hasn\u0027t as yet got to[Pg 100] flying out at me, but that will come as well, I dare say, by-and-by.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Félicité then answered with some hypocrisy: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I will speak to Marthe if you like. But it might, perhaps, hurt her if I did. Matters of this kind are better kept between husband and wife. I don\u0027t feel very uneasy about them; I\u0027ve no doubt that you\u0027ll soon get back again all the quiet peacefulness which you used to be so proud of.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret shook his head with downcast eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No! no!\u0027 he said; \u0027I know myself too well. I can make a noise, but it does no good. In reality I am as weak as a child. People are quite wrong in supposing that I gained my own way with my wife by force. She has generally done what I wanted her to do, because she was quite indifferent about everything, and would as soon do one thing as another. Mild as she looks, she is very obstinate, I can tell you. Well, I must try to make the best of it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, raising his eyes, he added: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It would have been better if I had said nothing about all this to you; but you won\u0027t mention it to anyone, will you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n When Marthe went to see her mother the next day, the latter received her with some show of coldness, and exclaimed: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is wrong of you, my dear, to show yourself so neglectful of your husband. I saw him yesterday and he is quite angry about it. I am well aware that he often behaves in a very ridiculous manner, but that does not justify you in neglecting your home.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe fixed her eyes upon her mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah! he has been complaining about me!\u0027 she said curtly. \u0027The least he could do would be to keep silent, for I never complain about him.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then she began to talk of other matters, but Madame Rougon brought her back to the subject of her husband by inquiring after Abbé Faujas. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Perhaps Mouret isn\u0027t very fond of the Abbé, and finds fault with you in consequence. Is that the case, do you think?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe showed great surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What an idea!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027What makes you think that my husband does not like Abbé Faujas? He has certainly never said anything to me which would lead me to imagine such a thing. He hasn\u0027t said anything to you, has[Pg 101] he? Oh no! you are quite mistaken. He would go up to their rooms to fetch them if the mother didn\u0027t come down to have her game of cards with him.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret, indeed, never complained in any way about Abbé Faujas. He joked with him a little bluntly sometimes, and occasionally brought his name into the teasing banter with which he tormented his wife, but that was all. \\n\\n \\n\\n One morning, as he was shaving, he said to Marthe: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you what, my dear; if ever you go to confession, take the Abbé for your director, and then your sins will, at any rate, be kept amongst ourselves.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Abbé Faujas heard confessions on Tuesdays and Fridays, on which days Marthe used to avoid going to Saint-Saturnin\u0027s. She alleged that she did not want to disturb him; but she was really under the influence of that timid uneasiness which disquieted her whenever she saw him in his surplice redolent of the mysterious odours of the sacristy. One Friday, she went with Madame de Condamin to see how the works at the Home of the Virgin were getting on. The men were just finishing the frontage. Madame de Condamin found fault with the ornamentation, which, said she, was extremely mean and characterless. At the entrance there ought to have been two slender columns with a pointed arch, something at once light and suggestive of religion, something that would be a credit to the committee of lady patronesses. Marthe hesitated for a time, but she gradually admitted that the place looked very mean as it was. Then as the other pressed her, she promised to speak to Monsieur Lieutaud on the subject that very day. In order that she might keep her promise, she went to the cathedral before returning home. It was four o\u0027clock when she got there, and the architect had just left. When she asked for Abbé Faujas, a verger told her that he was confessing in the chapel of Saint Aurelia. Then for the first time she recollected what day it was, and replied that she could not wait. But as she passed the chapel of Saint Aurelia on her way out, she thought that the Abbé might, perhaps, have already caught sight of her. The truth was that she felt singularly faint, and so she sat down outside the chapel, near the railing. And there she remained. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sky was grey, and the church was steeped in twilight. Here and there in the aisles, already shrouded in darkness, gleamed a lamp, or some gilt candelabrum, or some Virgin\u0027s silver robe; and a pale ray filtered through the great nave[Pg 102] and died away on the polished oak of the stalls and benches. Marthe had never before felt so completely overcome. Her legs seemed to have lost all their strength, and her hands were so heavy that she clasped them across her knees to save herself from having to support their weight. She allowed herself to drift into drowsiness, in which she still continued to hear and see, but in a very soft subdued fashion. The slight sounds wafted along beneath the vaulted roof, the falling of a chair, the slow step of some worshipper, all filled her with emotion, assumed a musical tone which thrilled her to the heart; while the last glimmers of daylight and the dusky shadows that crept up the pillars like covers of crape, assumed in her eyes all the delicate tints of shot silk. She gradually fell into a state of exquisite languor, in which she seemed to melt away and die. Everything around her then vanished, and she was thrilled with perfect happiness in her strange, trance-like condition. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sound of a voice awoke her from this state of ecstasy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am very sorry,\u0027 said Abbé Faujas; \u0027I saw you, but I could not get away.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She then appeared to wake up with a start. She looked at him. He was standing before her in the dying light, in his surplice. His last penitent had just left, and the empty church seemed to be growing still more solemn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You want to speak to me?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe made an effort to recall her thoughts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she murmured; \u0027but I can\u0027t remember now. Ah yes! it is about the frontage, which Madame de Condamin thinks too mean. There ought to be two columns instead of that characterless flat door. And up above one might put a pointed arch filled with stained glass. It would look very pretty. You understand what I mean, don\u0027t you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He gazed at her very gravely with his hands crossed over his surplice, and his head inclined towards her; and she, still seated, without strength to rise to her feet, went on stammering confusedly, as though she had been taken unawares in a sleep which she could not shake off. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It would entail additional expense, of course; but we might have columns of soft stone with a very simple moulding. We might speak about it to the master mason, and he will tell us how much it would cost. But we had better pay him his last account first. It is two thousand one hundred and odd francs, I think. We have the money in hand; Madame[Pg 103] Paloque told me so this morning. There will be no difficulty about that, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She lowered her head, as though she felt oppressed by the gaze that was bent upon her. When she raised it again and met the priest\u0027s eyes, she clasped her hands together, after the manner of a child seeking forgiveness, and she burst into sobs. The priest allowed her to weep, still standing in silence in front of her. Then she fell on her knees before him, weeping behind her hands, with which she covered her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Get up, I pray you,\u0027 said Abbé Faujas gently. \u0027It is before God that you should go and kneel.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He helped her to rise and he sat down beside her. They talked together for a long time in low tones. The night had now fully fallen, and the lamps set golden specks gleaming through the black depths of the church. The murmur of their voices alone disturbed the silence in front of the chapel of Saint Aurelia. From the priest streamed a flood of words after each of Marthe\u0027s weak broken answers. When at last they rose, he seemed to be refusing her some favour which she was seeking with persistence. And leading her towards the door, he raised his voice as he said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No! I cannot, I assure you I cannot. It would be better for you to take Abbé Bourrette.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am in great need of your advice,\u0027 Marthe murmured, beseechingly. \u0027I think that with your help everything would be easy to me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are mistaken,\u0027 he replied, in a sterner voice. \u0027On the contrary, I fear that my direction would be prejudicial to you to begin with. Abbé Bourrette is the priest you want, I assure you. Later on, I may perhaps give you a different reply.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Marthe obeyed the priest\u0027s injunctions, and on the morrow the worshippers at Saint-Saturnin\u0027s were surprised to see Madame Mouret kneel before Abbé Bourrette\u0027s confessional. Two days later nothing but this conversion was spoken of in Plassans. Abbé Faujas\u0027s name was pronounced with subtle smiles by certain people, but on the whole the impression was a good one and in favour of the Abbé. Madame Rastoil complimented Madame Mouret in full committee, and Madame Delangre professed to see in the matter a first blessing vouchsafed by God who rewarded the lady patronesses for their good work by touching the heart of the only one amongst them who had not conformed with the requirements[Pg 104] of religion. Madame de Condamin, taking Marthe aside, said to her: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You have done right, my dear. What you have done is a necessity for a woman; and, besides, as soon as one begins to go about a little, it is necessary to go to church.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The only matter of astonishment was her choice of Abbé Bourrette. That worthy man almost entirely confined himself to hearing the confessions of young girls. The ladies found him \u0027so very uninteresting.\u0027 On the Thursday at the Rougons\u0027 reception, before Marthe\u0027s arrival, the matter was talked over in a corner of the green drawing-room, and it was Madame Paloque with her waspish tongue who summed up the matter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Abbé Faujas has done quite right in not keeping her himself,\u0027 said she, with a twist of her mouth that made her still more hideous than usual; \u0027Abbé Bourrette is very successful in saving souls and appearances also.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n When Marthe came that evening her mother stepped forward to welcome her, and kissed her affectionately with some ostentation before the company. She herself had made her peace with God on the morrow of the Coup d\u0027état. She was of opinion that Abbé Faujas might now venture to return to the green drawing-room; but he excused himself, making a pretext of his work and his love of privacy. Madame Rougon then fancied that he was planning a triumphal return for the following winter. The Abbé\u0027s success was certainly on the increase. For the first few months his only penitents had come from the vegetable-market held behind the cathedral, poor hawkers, to whose dialect he had quietly listened without always being able to understand it; but now, especially since all the talk there had been in connection with the Home of the Virgin, he had a crowd of well-to-do citizens\u0027 wives and daughters dressed in silk kneeling before his confessional-box. When Marthe quietly mentioned that he would not receive her amongst his penitents, Madame de Condamin was seized with a sudden whim, and deserted her director, the senior curate of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s, who was greatly distressed thereby, to transfer the guardianship of her soul to Abbé Faujas. Such a distinction as this gave the latter a firm position in Plassans society. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Mouret learned that his wife now went to confession, he merely said to her: \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 105] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You have been doing something wrong lately, I suppose, since you find it necessary to go and tell all your affairs to a parson?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n In the midst of all this pious excitement he seemed to isolate himself and shut himself up in his own narrow and monotonous life still further. When his wife reproached him for complaining to her mother, he answered: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, you are right; it was wrong of me. It is foolish to give people any pleasure by telling them of one\u0027s troubles. However, I promise you that I won\u0027t give your mother this satisfaction a second time. I have been thinking matters over, and the house may topple down on our heads before I\u0027ll go whimpering to anyone again.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n From that time he never made any disparaging remarks about the management of the house or scolded his wife in the presence of strangers, but professed himself, as formerly, the happiest of men. This effort of sound sense cost him little, for he saw that it would tend to his comfort, which was the object of his constant thoughts. He even exaggerated his assumption of the part of a contented methodical citizen who took pleasure in living. Marthe only became aware of his impatience by his restless pacing up and down. For whole weeks he refrained from teasing or fault-finding as far as she was concerned, while upon Rose and his children he constantly poured forth his jeers, scolding them too from morning till night for the slightest shortcomings. \\n\\n \\n\\n Previously he had only been economical, now he became miserly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There is no sense in spending money in the way we are doing,\u0027 he grumbled to Marthe. \u0027I\u0027ll be bound you are giving it all to those young hussies of yours. But it\u0027s quite sufficient for you to waste your time over them. Listen to me, my dear. I will give you a hundred francs a month for housekeeping, and if you will persist in giving money to girls who don\u0027t deserve it, you must save it out of your dress allowance.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He kept firmly to his word, and the very next month he refused to let Marthe buy a pair of boots on the pretext that it would disarrange his accounts, and that he had given her full notice and warning. One evening his wife found him weeping bitterly in their bedroom. All her kindness of heart was aroused, and she clasped him in her arms and besought him to tell her what distressed him. But he roughly tore himself away from her and told her that he was not crying at[Pg 106] all, but simply had a bad headache. It was that, said he, which made his eyes red. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do you think,\u0027 he exclaimed, \u0027that I am such a simpleton as you are to cry?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She felt much hurt. The next day Mouret affected great gaiety; but some days afterwards, when Abbé Faujas and his mother came downstairs after dinner, he refused to play his usual game of piquet. He did not feel clear-headed enough for it, he said. On the next few nights he made other excuses, and so the games were broken off, and everyone went out on the terrace. Mouret seated himself in front of his wife and the Abbé, doing all he could to speak as much and as frequently as possible; while Madame Faujas sat a few yards away in the gloom, quite silent and still, with her hands upon her knees, like one of those legendary figures keeping guard over a treasure with the stern fidelity of a crouching dog. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Fine evening!\u0027 Mouret used to say every night. \u0027It is much pleasanter here than in the dining-room. It is very wise of you to come out and enjoy the fresh air. Ah! there\u0027s a shooting-star! Did your reverence see it? I\u0027ve heard say that it\u0027s Saint Peter lighting his pipe up yonder.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He laughed, but Marthe kept quite grave, vexed by his attempts at pleasantry, which spoilt her enjoyment of the expanse of sky that spread between Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s pear-trees and the chestnuts of the Sub-Prefecture. Sometimes he would pretend to be unaware that she conformed with the requirements of religion, and he would take the Abbé aside and tell him that he relied on him to effect the salvation of the whole house. At other times he could never begin a sentence without saying in a bantering tone, \u0027Now that my wife goes to confession—\u0027 Then having grown tired of this subject, he began to listen to what was being said in the neighbouring gardens, trying to catch the faint sounds of voices which rose in the calm night air, as the distant noises of Plassans were hushed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah! those are the voices of Monsieur de Condamin and Doctor Porquier!\u0027 he said, straining his ear towards the Sub-Prefecture. \u0027They are making fun of the Paloques. Did you hear Monsieur Delangre saying in his falsetto, \"Ladies, you had better come in, the air is growing cool\"? Don\u0027t you think that little Delangre always talks as though he had swallowed a reed-pipe?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he turned his head towards the Rastoils\u0027 garden. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 107] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They haven\u0027t anyone there to-night,\u0027 he said; \u0027I can\u0027t hear anything. Ah, yes! those big geese the daughters are by the waterfall. The elder one talks just as though she were gobbling pebbles. Every evening they sit there jabbering for a good hour. They can\u0027t want all that time to tell each other about the matrimonial offers they have had. Ah! they are all there! There\u0027s Abbé Surin, with a voice like a flute; and Abbé Fenil, who would do for a rattle on Good Friday. There are sometimes a score of them huddled together, without stirring a finger, in that garden. I believe they all go there to listen to what we say.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n While he went chattering on in this manner Abbé Faujas and Marthe merely spoke a few words, chiefly in reply to his questions. Generally they sat apart from him with their faces raised to the sky and their eyes gazing into space. One evening Mouret fell asleep. Then, inclining their heads towards each other, they began to talk in subdued tones; while some few yards away, Madame Faujas, with her hands upon her knees, her eyes wide open and her ears on the strain, yet never seeing or hearing anything, seemed to be keeping watch for them. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58407.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
