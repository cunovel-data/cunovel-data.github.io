{"id":29427,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER 4","content":"When Mouret reached the second floor he was more perturbed than a youth at his first assignation. The unexpected satisfaction of his long thwarted desires, and the hope of seeing something quite extraordinary, almost prevented him from breathing. Abbé Faujas slipped the key which he carried, and which he quite concealed in his big fingers, into the lock without making the faintest noise, and the door opened as silently as if it had been hung upon velvet hinges. Then the Abbé, stepping back, mutely motioned to Mouret to enter. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 30] \\n\\n \\n\\n The cotton curtains at the two windows were so thick that the room lay in a pale, chalky dimness like the half-light of a convent cell. It was a very large room, with a lofty ceiling, and a quiet, neat wall-paper of a faded yellow. Mouret ventured forward, advancing with short steps over the tiled floor, which was as smooth and shiny as a mirror, and so cold that he seemed to feel a chill through the soles of his boots. He glanced furtively around him and examined the curtainless iron bedstead, the sheets of which were so straightly stretched that it looked like a block of white stone lying in the corner. The chest of drawers, stowed away at the other end of the room, a little table in the middle, and two chairs, one before each window, completed the furniture. There was not a single paper on the table, not an article of any kind on the chest of drawers, not a garment hanging against the walls. Everything was perfectly bare except that over the chest of drawers there was suspended a big black wooden crucifix, looking like a dark splotch amidst the bare greyness of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Come this way, sir, will you?\u0027 said the Abbé. \u0027It is in this corner that the ceiling is stained.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n But Mouret did not hurry, he was enjoying himself. Although he saw none of the extraordinary things that he had vaguely expected to see, there seemed to him to be a peculiar odour about the room. It smelt of a priest, he thought; of a man with different ways from other men. But it vexed him that he could see nothing on which he might base some hypothesis carelessly left on any of the pieces of furniture or in any corner of the apartment. The room was just like its provoking occupant, silent, cold, and inscrutable. He was extremely surprised, too, not to find any appearance of poverty as he had expected. On the contrary, the room produced upon him much the same impression as he had felt when he had once entered the richly furnished drawing-room of the prefect of Marseilles. The big crucifix seemed to fill it with its black arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret felt, however, that he must go and look at the corner which Abbé Faujas was inviting him to inspect. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You see the stain, don\u0027t you?\u0027 asked the priest. \u0027It has faded a little since yesterday.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret rose upon tip-toes and strained his eyes, but at first he could see nothing. When the Abbé had drawn back the curtains, he was able to distinguish a slight damp-stain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s nothing very serious,\u0027 he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 31] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, no! but I thought it would be better to tell you of it. The wet must have soaked through near the edge of the roof.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, you are right; near the edge of the roof.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret made no further remark; he was again examining the room, now clear and distinct in the full daylight. It looked less solemn than before, but it remained as taciturn as ever. There was not even a speck of dust lying about to tell aught of the Abbé\u0027s life. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Perhaps,\u0027 continued the priest, \u0027we may be able to discover the place from the window. Just wait a moment.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He proceeded to open the window, but Mouret protested against him troubling himself any further, saying that the workmen would easily be able to find the leak. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is no trouble at all, I assure you,\u0027 replied the Abbé with polite insistence. \u0027I know that landlords like to know how matters are going on. Inspect everything, I beg of you. The house is yours.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n As he spoke these last words he smiled, a thing he did but rarely; and then as Mouret and himself leaned over the rail that crossed the window, and turned their eyes towards the guttering, he launched out into various technical details, trying to account for the appearance of the stain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I think there has been a slight depression of the tiles, perhaps even a breakage; unless, indeed, that crack which you can see up there in the cornice extends into the retaining-wall.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes, that is very possible,\u0027 Mouret replied; \u0027but I must confess, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé, that I really don\u0027t understand anything about these matters. However, the masons will see to it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The priest said nothing further on the subject, but quietly remained where he was, gazing out upon the garden beneath him. Mouret, who was leaning by his side, thought it would be impolite to hurry away. He was quite won over when his tenant, after an interval of silence, said to him in his soft voice: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You have a very pretty garden, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh! it\u0027s nothing out of the common,\u0027 replied Mouret. \u0027There used to be some fine trees which I was obliged to cut down, for nothing would grow in their shade, and we have to pay attention to utility, you know. This plot is quite large enough for us and keeps us in vegetables all through the season.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 32] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Abbé seemed surprised, and asked Mouret for details. The garden was an old-fashioned country garden, surrounded with arbours, and divided into four regular square plots by tall borders of box. In the middle was a shallow basin, but there was no fountain. Only one of the squares was devoted to flowers. In the other three, which were planted at their edges with fruit-trees, one saw some magnificent cabbages, lettuces, and other vegetables. The paths of yellow gravel were kept extremely neat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is a little paradise,\u0027 said Abbé Faujas. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There are several disadvantages, all the same,\u0027 replied Mouret, who felt extremely delighted at hearing his ground so highly praised. \u0027You will have noticed, for instance, that we are on a slope, and that the gardens hereabouts are on different levels. Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s is lower than mine, which, again, is lower than that of the Sub-Prefecture. The consequence is that the rain often does a great deal of damage. Then, too, a still greater disadvantage is that the people in the Sub-Prefecture overlook me, and the more so now that they have made that terrace which commands my wall. It is true that I overlook Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s garden, but that is very poor compensation I can assure you, for a man who never troubles himself about his neighbour\u0027s doings.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The priest seemed to be listening out of mere complaisance, just nodding his head occasionally but making no remarks. He followed with his eyes the motions of his landlord\u0027s hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And there is still another inconvenience,\u0027 continued Mouret, pointing to a path that skirted the bottom of the garden. \u0027You see that little lane between the two walls? It is called the Impasse des Chevillottes, and leads to a cart-entrance to the grounds of the Sub-Prefecture. Well, all the neighbouring properties have little doors giving access to the lane, and there are all sorts of mysterious comings and goings. For my part, being a family man with children, I fastened my door up with a couple of stout nails.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at the Abbé and winked, hoping that the priest would question him about the mysterious comings and goings to which he had just alluded. But Abbé Faujas seemed quite unconcerned; he merely glanced at the alley without showing any curiosity on the subject. Then he again gazed placidly upon the Mourets\u0027 garden. Marthe was in her customary place near the edge of the terrace, hemming napkins. She[Pg 33] had raised her head on first hearing voices, and then had resumed her work again, full of surprise at seeing her husband at one of the second-floor windows in the company of the priest. She now appeared to be quite unconscious of their presence. Mouret, however, had raised his voice from a sort of instinctive braggartism, proud of being able to show his wife that he had at last made his way into that room which had so persistently been kept private. The Abbé, on his side, every now and then let his calm eyes rest upon the woman, though all that he could see of her was the back of her bent neck and her black coil of hair. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were both silent again, and Abbé Faujas still seemed disinclined to leave the window. He now appeared to be examining their neighbour\u0027s flower beds. Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s garden was arranged in the English fashion, with little walks and grass plots broken by small flower-beds. At the bottom there was a circular cluster of trees, underneath which a table and some rustic chairs were set. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Monsieur Rastoil is very wealthy,\u0027 resumed Mouret, who had followed the direction of the Abbé\u0027s eyes. \u0027His garden costs him a large sum of money. The waterfall—you can\u0027t see it from here, it is behind those trees—ran away with more than three hundred francs. There isn\u0027t a vegetable about the place, nothing but flowers. At one time the ladies even talked of cutting down the fruit-trees; but that would have really been wicked, for the pear-trees are magnificent specimens. Well, I suppose a man has a right to lay out his ground so as to please his own fancy, if he can afford to do so.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, as the Abbé still continued silent, he continued: \u0027You know Monsieur Rastoil, don\u0027t you? Every morning, from eight o\u0027clock till nine, he walks about under his trees. He is a heavy man, rather short, bald, and clean shaven, with a head as round as a ball. He completed his sixtieth year at the beginning of last August, I believe. He has been president of our civil tribunal for nearly twenty years. Folks say he is a very good fellow, but I see very little of him. \"Good-morning,\" and \"Good-evening,\" that\u0027s about all that ever passes between us.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He stopped speaking as he saw several people coming down the steps of the neighbouring house and making their way towards the clump of trees. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 34] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah, yes!\u0027 he resumed, lowering his voice, \u0027to-day\u0027s Tuesday. There is a dinner party at the Rastoils\u0027. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Abbé had not been able to restrain a slight start, and had then bent forward to see better. Two priests who were walking beside a couple of tall girls seemed particularly to interest him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do you know who those gentlemen are?\u0027 Mouret inquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n And, when the priest only replied by a vague gesture, he added: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They were crossing the Rue Balande just as we met each other. The taller and younger one, the one who is walking between Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s two daughters, is Abbé Surin, our bishop\u0027s secretary. He is said to be a very amiable young man. The old one, who is walking a little behind, is one of our grand-vicars, Abbé Fenil. He is at the head of the seminary. He is a terrible man, flat and sharp, like a sabre. I wish he would turn round so that you might see his eyes. I am quite surprised that you don\u0027t know those gentlemen.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I go out very little,\u0027 said the Abbé, \u0027and there is no house in the town that I visit.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah! that isn\u0027t right. You must often feel very dull. To do you justice, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé, you are certainly not of an inquisitive disposition. Just fancy! you\u0027ve been here a month now, and you didn\u0027t even know that Monsieur Rastoil had a dinner-party every Tuesday! Why, it\u0027s right before your eyes there from this window!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret laughed slightly. He was forming a rather contemptuous opinion of the Abbé. Then in confidential tones he went on: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You see that tall old man who is with Madame Rastoil—the thin one I mean, with broad brims to his hat? Well, that is Monsieur de Bourdeu, the former prefect of the Dr?me, a prefect who was turned out of office by the revolution of 1848. He\u0027s another one that you don\u0027t know, I\u0027ll be bound. But Monsieur Maffre there, the justice of the peace, that white-headed old gentleman who is coming last, with Monsieur Rastoil, don\u0027t you know him? Well, that is really inexcusable. He is an honorary canon of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s! Between ourselves, he is accused of having killed his wife by his harshness and miserliness.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret stopped short, looked the Abbé in the face and said abruptly, with a smile: \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 35] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I beg your pardon, but I am not a very devout person, you know.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The Abbé again waved his hand with that vague gesture which did duty as an answer and saved him the necessity of making a more explicit reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No, I am not a very devout person,\u0027 Mouret repeated smilingly. \u0027But everyone should be left free, is it not so? The Rastoils, now, are a religious family. You must have seen the mother and daughters at Saint-Saturnin\u0027s. They are parishioners of yours. Ah! those poor girls! The elder, Angéline, is fully twenty-six years old, and the other, Aurélie, is getting on for twenty-four. And they\u0027re no beauties either, quite yellow and shrewish-looking. The parents won\u0027t let the younger one marry before her sister; but I dare say they\u0027ll both end by finding husbands somewhere, if only for the sake of their dowries. Their mother there, that fat little woman who looks as innocent and mild as a sheep, has given poor Rastoil some pretty experiences.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He winked his left eye, a common habit of his whenever he indulged in any pleasantry approaching broadness. The Abbé lowered his eyes, as if waiting for Mouret to go on, but, as the latter remained silent, he raised them again and watched the people in the garden as they seated themselves round the table under the trees. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last Mouret resumed his explanatory remarks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They will stay out there, enjoying the fresh air, till dinner-time,\u0027 said he. \u0027It is just the same every Tuesday. That Abbé Surin is a great favourite. Look how he is laughing there with Mademoiselle Aurélie. Ah! Abbé Fenil has observed us. What eyes he has! He isn\u0027t very fond of me, you know, as I\u0027ve had a dispute with a relation of his. But where has Abbé Bourrette got to? We haven\u0027t seen anything of him, have we? It is very extraordinary. He never misses Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s Tuesdays. He must be ill. You know him, don\u0027t you? What a worthy man he is! A most devoted servant of God!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Abbé Faujas was no longer listening. His eyes were constantly meeting those of Abbé Fenil, whose scrutiny he bore with perfect calmness, never once diverting his glance. He was even leaning more fully against the iron rail, and his eyes seemed to have grown bigger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah! here come the young people!\u0027 resumed Mouret as three young men arrived on the scene. \u0027The oldest one is[Pg 36] Rastoil\u0027s son; he has just been called to the Bar. The two others are the sons of Monsieur Maffre; they are still at college. By-the-by, I wonder why those young scamps of mine haven\u0027t come back yet.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n At that very moment Octave and Serge made their appearance on the terrace. Leaning against the balustrade they began to tease Désirée, who had just sat down by her mother\u0027s side. However, when the young folks caught sight of their father at the second-floor window, they lowered their voices and quietly laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There you see all my little family!\u0027 said Mouret complacently. \u0027We stay at home, we do; and we have no visitors. Our garden is a closed paradise, which the devil can\u0027t enter to tempt us.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He smiled as he spoke, for he was really amusing himself at the Abbé\u0027s expense. The latter had slowly brought his eyes to bear upon the group formed by his landlord\u0027s family under the window. He gazed down there for a moment; then looked round upon the old-fashioned garden with its beds of vegetables edged with borders of box; then again turned his eyes towards Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s pretentious grounds; and last of all, as though he wanted to get the plan of the whole surroundings into his head, directed his attention to the garden of the Sub-Prefecture. There was nothing to be seen here but a large central lawn, a gently undulating carpet of grass, with clusters of evergreen shrubs, and some tall thickly-foliaged chestnut trees which gave a park-like appearance to this patch of ground hemmed in by the neighbouring houses. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abbé Faujas glanced under the chestnut-trees, and at last remarked: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027These gardens are quite lively. There are some people, too, in the one on the left.\u0027 Mouret raised his eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes!\u0027 he said unconcernedly, \u0027it\u0027s like that every afternoon. They are the friends of Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, our sub-prefect. In the summer-time they meet in the evenings in the same way round the basin on the left, which you can\u0027t see from here. Ah! so Monsieur de Condamin has got back! That fine old man there, who is so well preserved and has such a bright colour; he is our conservator of rivers and forests; a jovial old fellow, who is constantly to be seen, gloved and tightly breeched, on horseback.[Pg 37] And the tales he can tell, too! He doesn\u0027t belong to this neighbourhood, and he has lately married a very young woman. However, that\u0027s fortunately no business of mine!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He bent his head again as he heard Désirée, who was playing with Serge, break out into one of her childish laughs. But the Abbé, whose face was now slightly flushed, recalled his attention by asking: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is that the sub-prefect, that fat gentleman with the white tie?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n This question seemed to amuse Mouret exceedingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, no!\u0027 he replied, with a laugh. \u0027It is very evident that you don\u0027t know Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies. He isn\u0027t forty yet; he\u0027s a tall, handsome, very distinguished-looking young man. That fat gentleman is Doctor Porquier, the fashionable medical man of Plassans. He is a very well-to-do man, I can assure you, and he has only one trouble, his son Guillaume. Do you see those two people sitting on the bench with their backs towards us? They are Monsieur Paloque, the assistant judge, and his wife. They are the ugliest couple in the town. It is difficult to say which is the worse-looking, the husband or the wife. Fortunately they have no children.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret began to laugh more loudly; he was growing excited, and kept on striking the window-rail. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I can never look at the assemblies in those grounds,\u0027 he continued, motioning with his head, first towards Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s garden and then towards the sub-prefect\u0027s, \u0027without being highly amused. You don\u0027t take any interest in politics, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé, or I could tell you some things which would tickle you immensely. Rightly or wrongly, I myself pass for a republican. Business matters take me a good deal about the country; I am a friend of the peasantry, and people have even talked about proposing me for the Council-General—in short, I am a well-known man. Well, on my right here, at Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s, we have the cream of the Legitimists, and on the left, at the Sub-Prefecture, we have the big-wigs of the Empire. And so, you see, my poor old-fashioned garden, my little happy nook, lies between two hostile camps. I am continually afraid lest they should begin throwing stones at each other, for the stones, you see, might very well fall into my garden.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mouret appeared to be quite delighted with this witticism[Pg 38] and drew closer to the Abbé, like some old gossip who is just going to launch out into a long story. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Plassans is a very curious place from a political point of view. The Coup d\u0027état succeeded here because the town is conservative. But first of all it is Legitimist and Orleanist; so much so, indeed, that at the outset of the Empire it wanted to dictate conditions. As its claims were disregarded, the town grew annoyed and went over to the opposition; yes, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé, to the opposition. Last year we elected for our deputy the Marquis de Lagrifoul, an old nobleman of mediocre abilities, but one whose election was a very bitter pill for the Sub-Prefecture.—Ah, look! there is Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies! He is with the mayor, Monsieur Delangre.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The Abbé glanced keenly in the direction indicated by Mouret. The sub-prefect, a very dark man, was smiling beneath his waxed moustaches. He was irreproachably dressed, and preserved a demeanour which suggested both that of a fashionable officer and that of a good-natured diplomatist. The mayor was by his side, talking and gesticulating rapidly. He was a short man, with square shoulders, and a sunken face that was rather Punch-like in appearance. He seemed to be garrulously inclined. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies,\u0027 continued Mouret, \u0027had felt so confident of the return of the official candidate that the result of the election nearly made him ill. It was very amusing. On the evening of the election, the garden of the Sub-Prefecture remained as dark and gloomy as a cemetery, while in the Rastoils\u0027 grounds there were lamps and candles burning under the trees, and joyous laughter and a perfect uproar of triumph. Our people don\u0027t let things be seen from the street, but they throw off all restraint and give full vent to their feelings in their gardens. Oh, yes! I see singular things sometimes, though I don\u0027t say anything about them.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He checked himself for a moment, as though he was unwilling to say more, but his gossiping propensities were too strong for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I wonder what course they will now take at the Sub-Prefecture?\u0027 he continued. \u0027They will never get their candidate elected again. They don\u0027t understand the people about here, and besides they are very weak. I was told that Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies was to have had a prefecture if the election had gone off all right. Ah! he will remain a[Pg 39] sub-prefect for a long time yet, I imagine! What stratagem will they devise, I wonder, to overthrow the Marquis? They will certainly have recourse to one of some kind or other; they will do their best somehow to effect the conquest of Plassans.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He turned his eyes upon the Abbé, at whom he had ceased to look for the last few moments, and he suddenly checked himself as he caught sight of the priest\u0027s eager face, his glistening eyes, and his ears that seemed to have grown bigger. All Mouret\u0027s bourgeois prudence then reasserted itself, and he felt that he had said too much. So he hastily added: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But, after all, I really know nothing about it. People tell so many ridiculous stories. All I care about is to be allowed to live quietly in my own house.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He would then have liked to leave the window, but he dared not go away so suddenly after gossiping in such an unrestrained and familiar fashion. He was beginning to think that if one of them had been having his laugh at the other, it certainly was not he. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Abbé, for his part, was again glancing alternately at the two gardens in a calm, unconcerned manner, and did not make the slightest attempt to induce Mouret to continue talking. Mouret was already wishing, somewhat impatiently, that his wife or one of his children would call to him to come down, when he was greatly relieved by seeing Rose appear on the steps outside the house. She raised her head towards him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, sir!\u0027 she cried, \u0027aren\u0027t you coming at all to-day? The soup has been on the table for the last quarter of an hour!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027All right, Rose! I\u0027ll be down directly,\u0027 he replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he made his apologies to the Abbé, and left the window. The chilly aspect of the room, which he had forgotten while his back had been turned to it, added to the confusion he felt. It seemed to him like a huge confessional-box, with its awful black crucifix, which must have heard everything he had said. When the Abbé took leave of him with a silent bow, this sudden finish of their conversation so disturbed him, that he again stepped back and, raising his eyes to the ceiling, said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is in that corner, then?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What is?\u0027 asked the Abbé in surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The damp stain that you spoke to me about.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The priest could not restrain a smile, but he again pointed out the stain to Mouret. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 40] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah! I can see it quite plainly now,\u0027 said the latter. \u0027Well, I\u0027ll send the workmen up to-morrow.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he at last left the room, and before he had reached the end of the landing, the door was noiselessly closed behind him. The silence of the staircase irritated him extremely, and as he went down, he muttered: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The confounded fellow! He gets everything out of one without asking a single question!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58402.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
