{"id":29438,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER 15","content":"One Friday, as Madame Paloque was entering Saint-Saturnin\u0027s, she was greatly surprised to see Marthe kneeling in front of Saint-Michael\u0027s chapel. The Abbé Faujas was hearing confessions. \u0027Ah!\u0027 she muttered, \u0027has she succeeded in touching the Abbé\u0027s heart? I must wait a little while and watch. It would be very fine if Madame de Condamin were to come.\u0027 She took a chair a little in the rear, and, half kneeling, covered her face with her hands as though she was absorbed in earnest prayer; but she held her fingers apart so that she might glance between them. The church was very gloomy. Marthe, with her head bent over her prayer-book, looked as though she were asleep. Her figure snowed blackly against a white pillar. Only her shoulders, heaving with deep-drawn sighs, seemed to be alive. She was, indeed, so profoundly overcome with emotion that she was constantly allowing her turn to be taken by some other of Abbé Faujas\u0027s penitents. The Abbé waited for a few moments, and then, seemingly a little impatient, he began tapping the woodwork of the confessional. Thereupon one of the women who were waiting, seeing that Marthe showed no sign of moving, decided to take her place. The chapel gradually grew empty, and Marthe still remained motionless as if in ecstasy. \u0027She seems in a terrible state,\u0027 thought Madame Paloque. \u0027It is really quite indecent to make such an exhibition of one\u0027s self in church. Ah! here comes Madame de Condamin!\u0027 Madame de Condamin was indeed just entering the church. She stopped for a moment before the holy-water[Pg 174] basin, removed her glove, and crossed herself with a pretty gesture. Her silk dress made a murmuring sound as she passed along the narrow space between the chairs. As she knelt down, she filled the lofty vault with a rustling of skirts. She had her usual affable expression, and smiled through the gloom. Soon she and Marthe were the only two penitents left. The priest grew more and more impatient, and tapped yet more loudly upon the woodwork of the confessional. \u0027It is your turn, madame; I am the last,\u0027 Madame de Condamin whispered politely, bending towards Marthe, whom she had not recognised. Marthe raised her face, pinched and pale from her extreme emotion, and did not appear to understand. It was as though she were awakening from some ecstatic trance, and her eyelids trembled. \u0027Come, ladies, come!\u0027 exclaimed Abbé Faujas, who had now half-opened the door of the confessional. Madame de Condamin smilingly rose to obey the priest\u0027s summons; but Marthe, recognising her, hastened into the chapel, to fall again upon her knees, however, a few paces away from the confessional-box. Madame Paloque felt much amused. She hoped that the two ladies would seize each other by the hair. Marthe could hear all that was said, for Madame de Condamin had a clear flute-like voice. She dallied over the recital of her sins, and quite animated the confessional with her pretty gossiping ways. Once she even vented a little muffled laugh, at the sound of which Marthe raised her pain-racked face. Soon afterwards Madame de Condamin finished her confession, and rose as if to retire, but she quickly stepped back and commenced talking afresh, this time merely bending her head without kneeling down. \u0027That she-devil is making sport of Madame Mouret and the Abbé,\u0027 thought the judge\u0027s wife to herself. \u0027It\u0027s all put on, is this.\u0027 At last Madame de Condamin really withdrew. Marthe watched her as if waiting till she disappeared. Then she went forward, leant against the confessional-box, and fell heavily on her knees. Madame Paloque had slipped a little nearer and was craning out her head, but she could only see the penitent\u0027s dark dress spread out around her. For nearly half an hour there was not the slightest movement. Now and then she thought she could detect some smothered sobs in the[Pg 175] throbbing silence, which was also broken at times by a creak from the confessional-box. She began to feel a little weary of her watching, for all she would be able to do now would be to stare at Marthe as she left the chapel. Abbé Faujas was the first to leave, closing the door of the confessional-box with an appearance of annoyance. Madame Mouret lingered there for a long time, bent and motionless. When she at last went away, her face covered with her veil, she seemed quite broken down, and even forgot to cross herself. \u0027There has been a row; the Abbé hasn\u0027t made himself pleasant,\u0027 thought Madame Paloque. Then she followed Marthe as far as the Place de l\u0027Archevêché, where she stopped and seemed to hesitate for a moment. At last, having glanced cautiously around to make sure that nobody was watching her, she stealthily slipped into the house where Abbé Fenil resided, at one of the corners of the Place. Marthe now almost lived at Saint-Saturnin\u0027s. She carried out her religious duties with the greatest fervour. Even Abbé Faujas often had to remonstrate with her about her excessive zeal. He only allowed her to communicate once a month, fixed the hours which she should devote to pious exercises, and insisted that she should not entirely shut herself up in religious practices. She for a long time requested him to let her attend a low mass every morning before he would accede to her desire. One day, when she told him that she had lain for a whole hour on the cold floor of her room to punish herself for some fault she had committed, he was very angry with her, and declared that her confessor alone had the right to inflict penance. He treated her throughout very sternly, and threatened to send her back to Abbé Bourrette if she did not absolutely follow his directions. \u0027I was wrong to take you at all,\u0027 he often said; \u0027I do not like disobedient souls.\u0027 She felt a pleasure in his harshness. That iron hand which bent her, and which held her back upon the edge of the adoration in the depths of which she would have liked to annihilate herself, thrilled her with ever-renewed desire. She remained like a neophyte, making but little advance in her journey of love, being constantly pulled up, and vaguely divining some yet greater bliss beyond. The sense of deep restfulness which she had first experienced in the church, that forgetfulness of herself and the outside[Pg 176] world, now changed, however, into positive actual happiness. It was the happiness for which she had been vaguely longing since her girlhood, and which she was now, at forty years of age, at last finding; a happiness which sufficed her, which compensated her for all the past-away years, and made her egotistical, absorbed in the new sensations that she felt within her like sweet caresses. \u0027Be kind to me,\u0027 she murmured to Abbé Faujas, \u0027be kind to me, for I stand in need of great kindness.\u0027 And when he did show her kindness, she could have gone down upon her knees and thanked him. At these times he unbent, spoke to her in a fatherly way, and pointed out to her that her imagination was too excited and feverish. God, said he, did not like to be worshipped in that way, in wild impulses. She smiled, looking quite pretty and young again with her blushing face, and promised to restrain herself in the future. But sometimes she experienced paroxysms of devotion, which cast her upon the flag-stones in some dark corner, where, almost grovelling, she stammered out burning words. Even her power of speech then died away, and she continued her prayers in feeling only, with a yearning of her whole being, an appeal for that divine kiss which seemed ever hovering about her brow without pressing it. At home Marthe became querulous, she who till now had been indifferent and listless, quite happy so long as her husband left her at peace. Now, however, that he had begun to spend all his time in the house, had lost his old spirit of raillery, and had grown mopish and melancholy, she grew impatient with him. \u0027He is always hanging about us,\u0027 she said to the cook one day. \u0027Oh, he does it out of pure maliciousness,\u0027 replied Rose. \u0027He isn\u0027t a good man at heart. I haven\u0027t found that out to-day for the first time. He has only put on that woebegone look, he who is so fond of hearing his tongue wag, in order to try to make us pity him. He\u0027s really bursting with anger, but he won\u0027t show it, because he thinks that if he looks wretched we shall be sorry for him and do just what he wants. You are quite right, madame, not to let yourself be influenced by all those grimaces and pretences.\u0027 Mouret kept a hold upon the women with his purse. He did not care to wrangle and argue with them, for fear of making his life still less comfortable than it already was;[Pg 177] but, though he no longer grumbled and meddled and interfered, he showed his displeasure by refusing a single extra crown piece to either Marthe or Rose. He gave the latter a hundred francs a month for the purchase of provisions; wine, oil, and preserves were in the house. The cook was obliged to make the sum stated last her till the end of the month, even if she had to pay for something out of her own pocket. As for Marthe, she had absolutely nothing; her husband never even gave her a sou, and she was compelled to appeal to Rose, and ask her to try to save ten francs out of the monthly allowance. She often found herself without a pair of boots to put on, and was obliged to borrow from her mother the money she needed to buy either a dress or a hat. \u0027But Mouret must surely be going mad!\u0027 Madame Rougon cried. \u0027You can\u0027t go naked! I will speak to him about it.\u0027 \u0027I beg you to do nothing of the kind, mother,\u0027 Marthe said. \u0027He detests you, and he would treat me even worse than he does already if he knew that I talked of these matters to you.\u0027 She began to cry as she added: \u0027I have shielded him for a long time, but I really can\u0027t keep silent any longer. You remember that he was once most unwilling for me even to set foot in the street; he kept me shut up, and treated me like a mere chattel. Now he behaves so unkindly because he sees that I have escaped from him, and that I won\u0027t submit any longer to be a mere servant. He is a man utterly without religion, selfish and bad-hearted.\u0027 \u0027He doesn\u0027t strike you, does he?\u0027 \u0027No; but it will come to that. At present he contents himself with refusing me everything. I have not bought any chemises for the last five years, and yesterday I showed him those I have. They are quite worn out, so patched and mended that I am ashamed of wearing them. He looked at them and examined them and said that they would do perfectly well till next year. I haven\u0027t a single centime of my own. The other day I had to borrow two sous from Rose to buy some thread to sew up my gloves, which were splitting all over.\u0027 She gave her mother many other details of the straits to which she was reduced—how she had to make laces for her boots out of blackened string, how she had to wash her[Pg 178] ribbons in tea to make her hat look a little fresher, and how she had to smear the threadbare folds of her only silk dress with ink to conceal the signs of wear. Madame Rougon expressed great pity for her, and advised her to rebel. Mouret was a monster, said she. Rose asserted that he carried his avarice so far as to count the pears in the store-room and the lumps of sugar in the cupboard, while he also kept a close eye on the preserves, and ate himself all the remnants of the loaves. It was a source of especial distress to Marthe that she was not able to contribute to the offertories at Saint-Saturnin\u0027s. She used to conceal ten-sou pieces in scraps of paper and carefully preserve them for high mass on Sundays. When the lady patronesses of the Home of the Virgin made some offering to the cathedral, such as a pyx, or a silver cross, or a banner, she felt quite ashamed, and kept out of the way, affecting ignorance of their intentions. The ladies felt much pity for her. She would have robbed her husband if she could have found the key of his desk, so keenly was she tortured at being able to do nothing for the honour of the church to which she was so passionately attached. She felt all the jealousy of a deceived woman when Abbé Faujas used a chalice which had been presented by Madame de Condamin; whereas on the days when he said mass in front of the altar cloth which she herself had embroidered she was filled with fervent joy, and said her prayers with ecstatic thrills, as though some part of herself lay beneath the priest\u0027s extended hands. She would have liked to have had a whole chapel of her own; and even dreamt of expending a fortune upon one, and of shutting herself up in it and receiving the Deity alone by herself at her own altar. Rose, of whom she made a confidant, had recourse to all sorts of plans to obtain money for her. That year she secretly gathered the finest fruit in the garden and sold it, and she also disposed of a lot of old furniture that was stowed away in an attic, managing her sales so well that she succeeded in getting together a sum of three hundred francs, which she handed to Marthe with great triumph. The latter kissed the old cook. \u0027Oh! how good you are!\u0027 she said to her, affectionately. \u0027Are you quite sure that he knows nothing about what you have done? I saw the other day, in the Rue des Orfèvres, two little cruets of chased silver, such dear little things; they[Pg 179] are marked two hundred francs. Now, you\u0027ll do me a little favour, won\u0027t you? I don\u0027t want to go and buy them myself, because someone would certainly see me going into the shop. Tell your sister to go and get them. She can bring them here after dark, and can give them to you through the kitchen window.\u0027 This purchase of the cruets seemed like a clandestine intrigue to Marthe, and thrilled her with the sweetest pleasure. For three days she kept the cruets at the bottom of a chest, hidden away beneath layers of linen; and when she gave them to Abbé Faujas in the sacristy of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s she trembled so much that she could scarcely speak. The Abbé scolded her in a kindly fashion. He was not fond of presents, and spoke of money with the disdain of a strong-minded man who only cares for power and authority. During his earlier years of poverty, even at times when he and his mother had no food beyond bread and water, he had never thought of borrowing even a ten-franc piece from the Mourets. Marthe found a safe hiding-place for the hundred francs which were still left her. She also was becoming a little miserly; and she schemed how she should best expend this money, making some fresh plan every morning. While she was still in a state of hesitation, Rose told her that Madame Trouche wished to see her privately. Olympe, who used to spend hours in the kitchen, had become Rose\u0027s intimate friend, and often borrowed a couple of francs of her to save herself from going upstairs at times when she said that she had forgotten to bring down her purse. \u0027Go upstairs and see her there,\u0027 said the cook; \u0027you will be better able to talk there. They are good sort of people, and they are very fond of his reverence. They have had a lot of trouble. Madame Olympe has quite made my heart ache with all the things she has told me.\u0027 When Marthe went upstairs she found Olympe in tears. They, the Trouches, were too soft-hearted, said she, and their kindness was always being abused. Then she entered upon an explanation of their affairs at Besan?on, where the rascality of a partner had saddled them with a heavy burden of debt. To make matters worse, their creditors were getting angry, and she had just received an insulting letter, the writer of which threatened to communicate with the Mayor and the Bishop of Plassans. [Pg 180] \u0027I don\u0027t mind what happens to me,\u0027 she sobbed, \u0027but I would give my head to save my brother from being compromised. He has already done too much for us, and I don\u0027t want to speak to him on the matter, for he is not rich, and he would only distress himself to no purpose. Good heavens! what can I do to keep that man from writing? My brother would die of shame if such a letter were sent to the Mayor and the Bishop. Yes, I know him well; he would die of shame!\u0027 Tears rushed to Marthe\u0027s eyes. She was quite pale, and fervently pressed Olympe\u0027s hands. Then, without the latter having preferred any request, she offered her the hundred francs she had. \u0027It is very little, I know; but perhaps it might be sufficient to avert the danger,\u0027 she said with an expression of great anxiety. \u0027A hundred francs, a hundred francs!\u0027 exclaimed Olympe. \u0027Oh, no! he would never be satisfied with a hundred francs.\u0027 Marthe lost all hope. She swore that she had not a centime more. She so far forgot herself as to speak of the cruets. If she had not bought them she would have been able to give three hundred francs. Madame Trouche\u0027s eyes sparkled. \u0027Three hundred francs, that is just what he demands,\u0027 she said. \u0027Ah! you would have rendered my brother a much greater service by not giving him that present, which, by the way, will have to remain in the church. What a number of beautiful things the ladies of Besan?on presented to him! But he isn\u0027t a bit the better off for them to-day! Don\u0027t give him anything more; it is really nothing but robbery! Consult me about what you do; there is so much hidden misery—No! a hundred francs will certainly not be sufficient!\u0027 At the end of half an hour spent in lamentation, however, she accepted the hundred francs when she saw that Marthe really had no more. \u0027I will send them so as to pacify the man a little,\u0027 she said, \u0027but he won\u0027t leave us at peace long. Whatever you do, I beg of you not to mention anything about it to my brother. It would nearly kill him. And I think it would be better, too, if my husband knew nothing of what has passed between us; he is so proud that he would be sure to be doing something rash to be able to acquit himself of our[Pg 181] obligation to you. We women can understand each other, you know.\u0027 This loan was a source of much pleasure to Marthe, who henceforth had a fresh care, that of warding off from Abbé Faujas the danger that threatened him without his being aware of it. She frequently went upstairs to the Trouches\u0027 rooms and stayed there for hours, discussing with Olympe the best means of discharging the debts. The latter had told her that a good many promissory notes had been endorsed by the priest, and that there would be a terrible scandal if they should ever be sent to any bailiff in Plassans to be protested. The sum total of their liabilities was so great, she said, that for a long time she refused to disclose it, only weeping the more bitterly when Marthe pressed her. One day, however, she mentioned the sum of twenty thousand francs. Marthe was quite frozen upon hearing this. She would never be able to procure anything like twenty thousand francs, and thought that she would certainly have to wait for Mouret\u0027s death before she could hope to have any such sum at her disposal. \u0027I say twenty thousand francs in all,\u0027 Olympe hastily added, disquieted by Marthe\u0027s grave appearance: \u0027but we should be quite satisfied if we were able to pay by small instalments spread over half a score of years. The creditors would wait for any length of time, if they were only sure of getting their instalments regularly. It is a great pity that we can\u0027t find anyone who has sufficient confidence in us to make the small necessary advances.\u0027 This matter became an habitual topic of conversation. Olympe also frequently spoke of Abbé Faujas, whom she seemed almost to worship. She gave Marthe all kinds of private details about the priest: such as, for instance, that he could not bear anything that tickled him, that he could sleep on his left side, and that he had a strawberry-mark on his right shoulder, which turned red in May like the natural fruit. Marthe smiled and never tired of hearing of these little matters; and she questioned the young woman about her childhood and that of her brother. When the subject of the money cropped up she seemed painfully overcome by her inability to do anything, and she even complained bitterly of Mouret, to whom Olympe, emboldened by Marthe\u0027s language, now always referred in her presence as the \u0027old miser.\u0027 Sometimes when Trouche returned from his office[Pg 182] he found the two women still talking together, but at his appearance they checked themselves and changed the subject. Trouche conducted himself in the most satisfactory way, and the lady patronesses of the Home of the Virgin were highly pleased with him. He was never seen in any of the cafés in the town. In order to be able to render some assistance to Olympe, who sometimes talked about throwing herself out of the window, Marthe made Rose take all the useless old odds and ends that were lying about the house to a second-hand dealer at the market. At first the two women were a little timid about the matter, and only disposed of broken-down chairs and tables when Mouret was out of the way, but afterwards they began to lay hands upon more important articles, and sold ornaments, pieces of china, and anything else they could remove without its absence appearing too conspicuous. They were slipping down a fatal incline, and would have ended by carting off all the furniture in the house and leaving nothing but the bare walls, if Mouret had not one day charged Rose with thieving and threatened to send for the police. \u0027What, sir! A thief! I!\u0027 she cried. \u0027Just because you happened to see me selling one of madame\u0027s rings. Be careful of what you are saying! The ring was mine; madame gave it to me. Madame isn\u0027t such a mean wretch as you are. You ought to be ashamed of yourself for leaving your wife without a sou! She hasn\u0027t even a pair of shoes to put on! The other day I had to pay the milkman myself! Yes, I did sell the ring, and what of that? Isn\u0027t madame\u0027s ring her own? She is obliged to turn it into money, since you won\u0027t give her any. If I were she, I would sell the whole house! The whole house, do you hear? It distresses me beyond everything to see her going about as naked as Saint John the Baptist!\u0027 Mouret now began to keep a close watch at all times. He locked up the cupboards and drawers, and kept the keys in his own possession. Whenever Rose went out he would look at her hands distrustfully, and even feel at her pockets if he saw any suspicious swelling beneath her skirt. He brought certain articles back from the second-hand dealer\u0027s and restored them to their places, dusting and wiping them ostentatiously in Marthe\u0027s presence in order to remind her of what he called Rose\u0027s thefts. He never directly accused his[Pg 183] wife. There was a cut-glass water-bottle which he turned into a special instrument of torture. Rose, having sold it for twenty sous, had pretended to Mouret that it was broken. But now he made her bring it and put it on the table at every meal. One day, at lunch, she quite lost her temper over it, and purposely let it fall. \u0027There, sir, it\u0027s really broken this time, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 she cried, laughing in his face. As he threatened to dismiss her, she exclaimed: \u0027You had better! I\u0027ve been in your service for five-and-twenty years. If I went madame would go with me!\u0027 Marthe, reduced to extremities and egged on by Rose and Olympe, at last rebelled. She was desperately in want of five hundred francs. For the last week Olympe had been crying and sobbing, asserting that if she could not get five hundred francs by the end of the month one of the bills which had been endorsed by Abbé Faujas would be published in one of the Plassans newspapers. The threatened publication of this bill, this terrible threat which she did not quite understand, threw Marthe into a state of dreadful alarm, and she resolved to dare everything. In the evening, as they were going to bed, she asked Mouret for the five hundred francs, and when he looked at her in amazement she began to speak of the fifteen years which she had spent behind a counter at Marseilles, with a pen behind her ear like a clerk. \u0027We made the money together,\u0027 she said; \u0027and it belongs to us both. I want five hundred francs.\u0027 Mouret thereupon broke his long maintained silence in the most violent fashion, and all his old raillery burst forth again. \u0027Five hundred francs!\u0027 he cried. \u0027Do you want them for your priest? I play the simpleton now and keep my peace for fear I might say too much; but you must not imagine that you can go on for ever making a fool of me! Five hundred francs! Why not say the whole house? The whole house certainly does seem to belong to him! He wants some money, does he? And he has told you to ask me for it? I might be among a lot of robbers in a wood instead of being in my own home! I shall have my very handkerchief stolen out of my pocket before long! I\u0027ll be bound that if I were to go and search his room I should find his drawers full of my property. There are seven pairs of my socks missing, four or five shirts, and three pairs[Pg 184] of pants. I was going over the things yesterday. Everything I have is disappearing, and I shan\u0027t have anything left very soon! No, not a single sou will I give you, not a single sou!\u0027 \u0027I want five hundred francs; half of the money belongs to me,\u0027 Marthe tranquilly replied. For a whole hour Mouret stormed and fumed and repeated the same reproaches. His wife was no longer the same, he said. He did not know her now. Before the priest\u0027s arrival, she had loved him and obeyed him and looked after the house. Those who set her to act in opposition to him must be very wicked persons. Then his voice grew thick, and he let himself fall into a chair, broken down and as weak as a child. \u0027Give me the key of your desk!\u0027 said Marthe. He got up from his chair and gathered his strength together for a last cry of protest. \u0027You want to strip me of everything, eh? to leave your children with nothing but straw for a bed? You won\u0027t even leave us a loaf of bread? Well! well! clear out everything, and send for Rose to fill her apron! There\u0027s the key!\u0027 He threw the key at Marthe and she placed it under her pillow. She was quite pale after this quarrel, the first violent quarrel that she had ever had with her husband. She got into bed, but Mouret passed the night in an easy-chair. Towards morning Marthe heard him sobbing. She would then have given him back the key, if he had not wildly rushed into the garden, though it was still pitch dark. Peace again seemed to be re-established between them. The key of the desk remained hanging upon a nail near the mirror. Marthe, who was quite unaccustomed to the sight of large sums, felt a sort of fear of the money. She was very bashful and shamefaced at first whenever she went to open the drawer in which Mouret always kept some ten thousand francs in cash to pay for his purchases of wine. She strictly confined herself to taking only what was necessary. Olympe, too, gave her the most excellent advice, and told her that now she had the key she ought to be careful and economical; and, indeed, seeing the trembling nervousness which she exhibited at the sight of the hoard of money, she ceased for some time to speak to her of the Besan?on debts. Mouret meantime relapsed into his former moody silence. Serge\u0027s admission to the Seminary had been another severe blow to him. His friends of the Cours Sauvaire, the retired[Pg 185] traders who promenaded there regularly between four o\u0027clock and six, began to feel very uneasy about him, when they saw him arrive with his arms swaying about and his face wearing a stupefied expression. He hardly made any reply to their remarks and seemed a prey to some incurable disease. \u0027He\u0027s breaking up; he\u0027s breaking up,\u0027 they murmured to each other; \u0027and he\u0027s only forty-four; it\u0027s scarcely credible. He will end by having softening of the brain.\u0027 Mouret no longer seemed to hear the malicious allusions which were made before him. If he was questioned directly about Abbé Faujas, he coloured slightly as he replied that the priest was an excellent tenant and paid his rent with great punctuality. When his back was turned, the retired shopkeepers grinned as they sat and basked in the sun on one of the seats on the Cours. \u0027Well, after all, he is only getting what he deserves,\u0027 said a retired almond-dealer. \u0027You remember how hotly he stood up for the priest, how he sang his praises in the four corners of Plassans; but when one talks to him on that subject now rather an odd expression comes over his face.\u0027 These worthy gentlemen then regaled themselves with certain scandalous stories which they whispered into each other\u0027s ears, passing them on in this way from one end of the bench to the other. \u0027Well,\u0027 said a master-tanner in a half whisper, \u0027there isn\u0027t much pluck about Mouret; if I were in his place I would soon show the priest the door.\u0027 Thereupon they all repeated that Mouret was certainly a very timid fellow, he who had formerly jeered so much at those husbands who allowed their wives to lead them by the nose. These stories, however, in spite of the persistence with which certain persons kept them afloat, never got beyond a particular set of idle gossiping people, and the reason which the Curé himself gave for not taking up his residence at the parsonage, namely, his liking for the Mourets\u0027 beautiful garden, where he could read his breviary in such perfect peace, was generally accepted as the true one. His great piety, his ascetic life and his contempt for all the frivolities and coquetries which other priests allowed themselves placed him beyond suspicion. The members of the Young Men\u0027s Club accused Abbé Fenil of trying to ruin him. All the new part of the town was on his side, and it was only the Saint-Marc quarter[Pg 186] that was against him, its aristocratic inhabitants treating him with great reserve whenever they met him in Monseigneur Rousselot\u0027s saloons. However, in spite of his popularity, he shook his head when old Madame Rougon told him that he might now dare everything. \u0027Nothing is quite safe and solid yet,\u0027 he said. \u0027I am not sure of anyone. The least touch might bring the whole edifice toppling down.\u0027 Marthe had been causing him anxiety for some time past. He felt that he was incapable of calming the fever of devotion which was raging within her. She escaped his control and disobeyed him, and advanced further than he wished her to do. He was afraid lest this woman, this much-respected patroness, who was so useful, might yet bring about his ruin. There was a fire burning within her which seemed to discolour her flesh, and redden her eyes and make them heavy. It was like an ever-growing disease, an infatuation of her whole being, that was gradually weakening her heart and brain. She often seemed to lapse into some ecstatic trance, her hands were shaken by a nervous trembling, and a dry cough occasionally shook her from head to foot without consciousness apparently on her part of how it was rending her. The Curé then showed himself sterner to her than before, tried to crush the passion which was dawning within her, and even forbade her to come to Saint-Saturnin\u0027s. \u0027The church is very cold,\u0027 he said, \u0027and you cough so much there. I don\u0027t want you to do anything to make yourself worse.\u0027 She protested that there was nothing the matter with her beyond a slight irritation of the throat, but at last she yielded and accepted his prohibition as a well-deserved punishment which closed the doors of heaven upon her. She wept, believed that she was damned, and dragged herself listlessly through the blank weary days; and then, in spite of herself, like a woman returning to some forbidden love, when Friday came she humbly glided into Saint-Michael\u0027s chapel and laid her burning brow against the woodwork of the confessional-box. She did not speak a word, but simply knelt there, completely crushed, quite overwhelmed. At this Abbé Faujas, who was greatly irritated, treated her as harshly as though she was some unworthy woman, and hastily ordered her away. Then she left the church, feeling happy and consoled. The priest was afraid of the effect of the gloomy darkness[Pg 187] of Saint-Michael\u0027s chapel. He spoke upon the subject to Doctor Porquier, who persuaded Marthe to go to confession at the little oratory of the Home of the Virgin in the suburb. Abbé Faujas promised to be there to hear her every other Saturday. This oratory, which had been established in a large whitewashed room with four big windows, was bright and cheerful, and would, he thought, have a calming effect upon the excited imagination of his penitent. There, he thought, he would be able to bring her under control, reduce her to obedience, without possible fear of any scandal. As a guard against all calumnious gossip, he asked his mother to accompany Marthe, and while he confessed the latter Madame Faujas remained outside the door. As the old lady did not like to waste her time, she used to take her knitting with her and work away at a stocking. \u0027My dear child,\u0027 she often said to Marthe, as they were returning together to the Rue Balande, \u0027I could hear very well what Ovide was saying to you to-day. You don\u0027t seem to be able to please him. You can\u0027t care for him. Ah! I wish I were in your place to be able to kiss his feet! I shall grow to hate you, if you go on causing him nothing but annoyance.\u0027 Marthe bent her head. She felt deep shame in Madame Faujas\u0027s presence. She did not like her, she felt jealous of her at finding her always coming between herself and the priest. The old lady\u0027s dark eyes, too, troubled her when they constantly bent upon her, full as they seemed of strange and disquieting thoughts. Marthe\u0027s weak state of health sufficed to account for her meetings with Abbé Faujas at the oratory of the Home of the Virgin. Doctor Porquier stated that she went there simply in obedience to his orders, and the promenaders on the Cours were vastly amused by this saying of the doctor\u0027s. \u0027Well, all the same,\u0027 remarked Madame Paloque to her husband one day, as she watched Marthe going down to the Rue Balande, accompanied by Madame Faujas, \u0027I should like to be in some corner and watch the vicar and his sweetheart. It is very amusing to hear her talk of her bad cold! As though a bad cold was any reason why one shouldn\u0027t make one\u0027s confession in church! I have had colds, but I never made them an excuse for shutting myself up in a little chapel with a priest.\u0027 \u0027It is very wrong of you to interfere in Abbé Faujas\u0027s[Pg 188] affairs,\u0027 the judge replied to his wife. \u0027I have been spoken to about him. He is a man with whom we must keep on good terms, and you will prevent us from doing so; you are too spiteful.\u0027 \u0027Stuff!\u0027 she retorted angrily; \u0027they have trampled me under foot and I will let them know who I am! Your Abbé Faujas is a big imbecile! Don\u0027t you suppose that Abbé Fenil would be very grateful to me if I could catch the vicar and his sweetheart? Ah! he would give a great deal to have a scandal like that! Just you leave me alone; you don\u0027t understand anything about such matters.\u0027 A fortnight later, Madame Paloque watched Marthe go out on the Saturday. She was standing ready dressed, hiding her hideous face behind her curtains, but keeping watch over the street through a hole in the muslin. When the two women disappeared round the corner of the Rue Taravelle, she sniggered, and leisurely drawing on her gloves went quietly on to the Place of the Sub-Prefecture, and walked slowly round it. As she passed in front of Madame de Condamin\u0027s little house, she thought for a moment of going in and taking her with her, but she reflected that the other might, perhaps, have some scruples. And, all considered, it was better she should be without witnesses, and manage the business by herself. \u0027I have given them time,\u0027 she thought, after a quarter of an hour\u0027s promenade. \u0027I think I may present myself now.\u0027 Thereupon she quickened her pace. She frequently went to the Home of the Virgin to discuss the accounts with Trouche, but that day, instead of repairing to the secretary\u0027s office, she went straight along the corridor towards the oratory. Madame Faujas was quietly knitting on a chair in front of the door. The judge\u0027s wife had foreseen that obstacle, and went straight on to the door with the hasty manner of a person who has important business on hand. But before she could reach out her hand to turn the handle the old lady had risen from her chair and pushed her aside with extraordinary energy. \u0027Where are you going?\u0027 she asked in her blunt peasant-woman\u0027s tones. \u0027I am going where I have business,\u0027 Madame Paloque replied, her arm smarting and her face convulsed with anger. \u0027You are an insolent, brutish woman! Let me pass! I am[Pg 189] the treasurer of the Home of the Virgin, and I have a right to go anywhere here I want.\u0027 Madame Faujas, who stood leaning against the door, straightened her spectacles upon her nose, and with unruffled tranquillity resumed her knitting. \u0027Well,\u0027 she said bluntly, \u0027you can\u0027t go in there.\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t, indeed! And may I ask why?\u0027 \u0027Because I don\u0027t wish that you should.\u0027 The judge\u0027s wife felt that her plan was frustrated, and she almost choked with spleen and anger. She was positively frightful to look at as she gasped and stammered: \u0027I don\u0027t know who you are, and I don\u0027t know what you are doing here. If I were to call out, I could have you arrested, for you have struck me. There must be some great wickedness going on at the other side of that door for you to have been put there to keep people from entering. I belong to the house, I tell you! Let me pass, or I shall call for help.\u0027 \u0027Call for anyone you like,\u0027 replied the old lady, shrugging her shoulders. \u0027I have told you that you shall not go in, that I won\u0027t let you. How am I to know that you belong to the house? But it makes no difference whether you do or you don\u0027t. No one can go in. I won\u0027t let them.\u0027 Thereupon Madame Paloque lost all control of herself, raised her voice, and shrieked out: \u0027I have no occasion to go in now! I have learnt quite sufficient! You are Abbé Faujas\u0027s mother, are you not? This is a very decent and pretty part for you to be playing! I wouldn\u0027t enter the room now; I wouldn\u0027t mix myself up with all this wickedness!\u0027 Madame Faujas laid her knitting upon the chair, and, bending slightly forward, gazed with glistening eyes through her spectacles at Madame Paloque, holding her hands the while a little in front of her, as though she were about to spring upon the angry woman and silence her. She was, indeed, going to throw herself forward, when the door suddenly opened and Abbé Faujas appeared on the threshold. He was in his surplice and looked very stern. \u0027Well, mother,\u0027 he asked, \u0027what is going on here?\u0027 The old lady bent her head, and stepped back like a dog that is taking its place at its master\u0027s heels. \u0027Ah! is it you, dear Madame Paloque?\u0027 the Curé continued; \u0027do you want to speak to me?\u0027 By a supreme effort of will, the judge\u0027s wife forced her[Pg 190] face into a smile. She answered the priest in a tone that was terrible in its amiability and mingled irony. \u0027Ah! you were inside were you, your reverence? If I had known that, I would not have insisted upon entering. But I want to see the altar-cloth, which must, I think, be getting into a bad condition. I am a careful superintendent here, you know, and I keep an eye upon all these little details. But, of course, if you are engaged in the oratory, I wouldn\u0027t think of disturbing you. Pray go on with what you are doing; the house is yours. If madame had only just dropped me a word, I would have left her quietly to continue guarding you from being disturbed.\u0027 Madame Faujas allowed a growl to escape her, but a glance from her son reduced her to silence. \u0027Come in, I beg you,\u0027 he said; \u0027you won\u0027t disturb me in the least. I was confessing Madame Mouret, who is not very well. Come in, by all means. The altar-cloth might very well be changed, I think.\u0027 \u0027Oh, no! I will come some other time,\u0027 Madame Paloque replied. \u0027I am quite distressed to have interrupted you. Pray go on, your reverence, pray go on!\u0027 Notwithstanding her protestations, however, she entered the room. While she was examining the altar-cloth with Marthe, the priest began to chide his mother in a low voice: \u0027Why did you prevent her coming in, mother? I never told you to allow no one to enter.\u0027 She gazed straight in front of her with her obstinate determined glance. \u0027She would have had to walk over my body before she got inside,\u0027 she muttered. \u0027But why?\u0027 \u0027Because——. Listen to me, Ovide; don\u0027t be angry; you know that it pains me to see you angry. You told me to accompany our landlady here, didn\u0027t you? Well, I thought you wanted me to stop inquisitive people\u0027s curiosity. So I took my seat out here, and no one should have entered, be sure of that.\u0027 But the priest caught hold of his mother\u0027s hands and shook her, exclaiming: \u0027Why, mother, you couldn\u0027t have supposed——\u0027 \u0027I suppose nothing,\u0027 she replied, with sublime indifference. \u0027You are free to do whatever pleases you. You are my child; I would steal for you, I would.\u0027 The priest was no longer listening to her. He had let[Pg 191] her hands drop, and, as he gazed at her, he seemed to be lost in reflections, which made his face look sterner and more austere than ever. \u0027No, never!\u0027 he exclaimed with lofty pride. \u0027You are greatly mistaken, mother. It is only the chaste who are powerful.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58413.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
