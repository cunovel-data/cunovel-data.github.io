{"id":29429,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER 6","content":"About nine o\u0027clock on the following evening, Abbé Bourrette called for Abbé Faujas. He had promised to go with him to the Rougons\u0027 and introduce him there. He found him ready, standing in the middle of his big bare room, and putting on a pair of black gloves that were sadly whitened at the finger-tips. Bourrette could not restrain a slight grimace as he looked at him. \u0027Haven\u0027t you got another cassock?\u0027 he asked. \u0027No,\u0027 quietly replied Abbé Faujas. \u0027This one is still very decent, I think.\u0027 \u0027Oh, certainly! certainly!\u0027 stammered the old priest; \u0027but it\u0027s very cold outside. Hadn\u0027t you better put something round your shoulders? Well! well! come along then!\u0027 The nights had just commenced to be frosty. Abbé Bourrette, who was warmly wrapped in a padded silk overcoat, got quite out of breath as he panted along after Abbé Faujas, who wore nothing over his shoulders but his thin, threadbare cassock. They stopped at the corner of the Rue de la Banne and the Place of the Sub-Prefecture, in front of a house built entirely of white stone, one of the handsome mansions of the new part of the town. A servant in blue livery received them at the door and ushered them into the hall. He smiled at Abbé Bourrette as he helped him to take off his overcoat, and seemed greatly surprised at the appearance of the other priest, that tall, rough-hewn man, who had ventured out on such a bitter night without a cloak. The drawing-room was on the first floor, and Abbé Faujas entered it with head erect, and grave, though perfectly easy,[Pg 54] demeanour, while Abbé Bourrette, who was always very nervous when he went to the Rougons\u0027 house, although he never missed a single one of their receptions, made his escape into an adjoining apartment, thus cowardly leaving his companion in the lurch. Faujas, however, slowly traversed the whole drawing-room in order to pay his respects to the mistress of the house, whom he felt sure he could recognise among a group of five or six ladies. He was obliged to introduce himself, and he did so in two or three words. Félicité had immediately risen from her seat, and she closely if quickly scanned him from head to foot. Then her eyes sought his own, as she smilingly said: \u0027I am delighted, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé; I am delighted indeed.\u0027 The priest\u0027s passage through the drawing-room had created considerable sensation. One young lady who had suddenly raised her head, had quite trembled with alarm at the sight of that great black mass in front of her. The impression created by the Abbé was, indeed, an unfavourable one. He was too tall, too square-shouldered, his face was too hard and his hands were too big. His cassock, moreover, looked so frightfully shabby beneath the bright light of the chandelier that the ladies felt a kind of shame at seeing a priest so shockingly dressed. They spread out their fans, and began to giggle behind them, while pretending to be quite unconscious of the Abbé\u0027s presence. The men, meantime, exchanged very significant glances. Félicité saw what a very churlish welcome the priest was receiving; she seemed annoyed at it, and remained standing, raising her voice in order to force her guests to hear the compliments which she addressed to Faujas. \u0027That dear Bourrette,\u0027 said she, in her most winning tone, \u0027has told me what difficulty he had in persuading you to come. I am really quite cross with you, sir. You have no right to deprive society of the pleasure of your company.\u0027 The priest bowed without making any reply, and the old lady laughed as she began to speak again, laying a meaning emphasis on certain of her words. \u0027I know more about you than you imagine, in spite of all the care you have taken to hide your light under a bushel. I have been told about you; you are a very holy man, and I want to be your friend. We shall have an opportunity to talk about this, for I hope that you will now consider yourself as one of our circle.\u0027 [Pg 55] Abbé Faujas looked at her fixedly, as though he had recognised some masonic sign in the movements of her fan. He lowered his voice as he replied: \u0027Madame, I am entirely at your service.\u0027 \u0027I am delighted to hear you say so,\u0027 said Madame Rougon with another laugh. \u0027You will find that we do our best here to make everyone happy. But come with me and let me present you to my husband.\u0027 She crossed the room, disturbing several of her guests in her progress to make way for Abbé Faujas, thus giving him an importance which put the finishing touch to the prejudice against him. In the adjoining room some card-tables were set out. She went straight up to her husband, who was gravely playing whist. He seemed rather impatient as she stooped down to whisper in his ear, but the few words she said to him made him spring briskly from his seat. \u0027Very good! very good!\u0027 he murmured. Then, having first apologised to those with whom he was playing, he went and shook hands with Abbé Faujas. At that time Rougon was a stout, pale man of seventy, and had acquired all a millionaire\u0027s gravity of expression. He was generally considered by the Plassans people to have a fine head, the white, uncommunicative head of a man of political importance. After he had exchanged a few courtesies with the priest he resumed his seat at the card-table. Félicité had just gone back into the drawing-room, her face still wreathed with smiles. When Abbé Faujas at last found himself alone he did not manifest the slightest sign of embarrassment. He remained for a moment watching the whist-players, or appearing to do so, for he was, in reality, examining the curtains, and carpet, and furniture. It was a small wainscotted room, and book-cases of dark pear-tree wood, ornamented with brass beadings, occupied three of its sides. It looked like a magistrate\u0027s private sanctum. At last the priest, who was apparently desirous of making a complete inspection, returned to the drawing-room and crossed it. It was hung with green, and was in keeping with the smaller salon, but there was more gilding about it, so that it suggested the soberness of a minister\u0027s private room combined with the brightness of a great restaurant. On the other side of it was a sort of boudoir where Félicité received her friends during the day. This was hung in straw colour, and was so full of easy-chairs and ottomans and couches, covered[Pg 56] with brocade with a pattern of violet scroll-work, that there was scarcely room to move about in it. Abbé Faujas took a seat near the fireplace and pretended to be warming his feet. He had placed himself in such a position that through the open doorway he could command a view of the greater part of the large drawing-room. He reflected upon Madame Rougon\u0027s gracious reception, and half closed his eyes, as though he were thinking out some problem which it was rather difficult to solve. A moment or two afterwards, while he was still absorbed in his reverie, he heard someone speaking behind him. His large-backed easy-chair concealed him from sight, and he kept his eyes still more tightly closed than before, as he remained there listening, looking for all the world as though the warmth of the fire had sent him to sleep. \u0027I went to their house just once at that time,\u0027 an unctuous voice was saying. \u0027They were then living opposite this place, on the other side of the Rue de la Banne. You were at Paris then; but all Plassans at that period knew of the Rougons\u0027 yellow drawing-room. A wretched room it was, hung with lemon-coloured paper at fifteen sous the piece, and containing some rickety furniture covered with cheap velvet. But look at black Félicité now, dressed in plum-coloured satin and seated on yonder couch! Do you see how she gives her hand to little Delangre? Upon my word, she is giving it to him to kiss!\u0027 Then a younger voice said with something of a sneer: \u0027They must have managed to lay their hands on a pretty big share of plunder to be able to have such a beautiful drawing-room; it is the handsomest, you know, in the whole town.\u0027 \u0027The lady,\u0027 the other voice resumed, \u0027has always had a passion for receptions. When she was hard up she drank water herself so that she might be able to provide lemonade for her guests. Oh! I know all about the Rougons. I have watched their whole career. They are very clever people, and the Coup d\u0027état has enabled them to satisfy the dreams of luxury and pleasure which had been tormenting them for forty years. Now you see what a magnificent style they keep up, how lavishly they live! This house which they now occupy formerly belonged to a Monsieur Peirotte, one of the receivers of taxes, who was killed in the affair at Sainte-Roure in the insurrection of \u002751. Upon my word, they\u0027ve had the most[Pg 57] extraordinary luck: a stray bullet removed the man who was standing in their way, and they stepped into his place and house. If it had been a choice between the receivership and the house, Félicité would certainly have chosen the house. She had been hankering after it for half a score years nearly, making herself quite ill by her covetous glances at the magnificent curtains that hung at the windows. It was her Tuileries, as the Plassans people used to say, after the 2nd of December.\u0027 \u0027But where did they get the money to buy this house?\u0027 \u0027Ah! no one knows that, my dear fellow. Their son Eugène, who has had such amazing political success in Paris, and has become a deputy, a minister and a confidential adviser at the Tuileries, had no difficulty in obtaining the receivership and the cross of the Legion of Honour for his father, who had played his cards very cleverly here. As for the house, they probably paid for it by borrowing the money from some banker. Anyhow, they are wealthy people to-day, and are fast making up for lost time. I fancy their son keeps up a constant correspondence with them, for they have not made a single false step as yet.\u0027 The person who was speaking paused for a moment, then resumed with a low laugh: \u0027Ah! I really can\u0027t help laughing when I see that precious grasshopper of a Félicité putting on all her fine duchess\u0027s airs! I always think of the old yellow drawing-room with its threadbare carpet and shabby furniture and little fly-specked chandelier. And now, to-day, she receives the Rastoil young ladies. Just look how she is man?uvring the train of her dress! Some day, my dear fellow, that old woman will burst of sheer triumph in the middle of her green drawing-room!\u0027 Abbé Faujas had gently let his head turn so that he might peep at what was going on in the drawing-room. There he observed Madame Rougon standing in all her majesty in the centre of a group of guests. She seemed to have increased in stature, and every back around bent before her glance, which was like that of some victorious queen. \u0027Ah! here\u0027s your father!\u0027 said the person with the unctuous voice; \u0027the good doctor is just arriving. I\u0027m quite surprised that he has never told you of all these matters. He knows far more about them than I do.\u0027 \u0027Oh! my father is always afraid lest I should compromise[Pg 58] him,\u0027 replied the other gaily. \u0027You know how he rails at me and swears that I shall make him lose all his patients. Ah! excuse me, please; I see the young Maffres over there, I must go and shake hands with them.\u0027 There was a sound of chairs being moved, and Abbé Faujas saw a tall young man, whose face already bore signs of physical weariness, cross the small room. The other person, the one who had given such a lively account of the Rougons, also rose from his seat. A lady who happened to pass near him allowed him to pay her some pretty compliments; and she smiled at him and called him \u0027dear Monsieur de Condamin.\u0027 Thereupon the priest recognised him as the fine man of sixty whom Mouret had pointed out to him in the garden of the Sub-Prefecture. Monsieur de Condamin came and sat down on the other side of the fireplace. He was startled to see Abbé Faujas, who had been quite concealed by the back of his chair, but he appeared in no way disconcerted. He smiled and, with amicable self-possession, exclaimed: \u0027I think, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé, that we have just been unintentionally confessing ourselves. It\u0027s a great sin, isn\u0027t it, to backbite one\u0027s neighbour? Fortunately you were there to give us absolution.\u0027 The Abbé, in spite of the control which he usually had over his features, could not restrain a slight blush. He perfectly understood that Monsieur de Condamin was reproaching him for having kept so quiet in order to listen to what was being said. Monsieur de Condamin, however, was not a man to preserve a grudge against anyone for their curiosity, but quite the contrary. He was delighted at the complicity which the matter seemed to have established between himself and the Abbé. It put him at liberty to talk freely and to while away the evening in relating scandalous stories about the persons present. There was nothing that he enjoyed so much, and this Abbé, who had only recently arrived at Plassans, seemed likely to prove a good listener, the more especially as he had an ugly face, the face of a man who would listen to anything, and wore such a shabby cassock that it would be preposterous to think that any confidence to which he might be treated would lead to unpleasantness. By the end of a quarter of an hour Monsieur de Condamin became quite at his ease, and gave Abbé Faujas a detailed account of Plassans with all the suave politeness of a man of the world. [Pg 59] \u0027You are a stranger amongst us, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé,\u0027 said he, \u0027and I shall be delighted if I can be of any assistance to you. Plassans is a little hole of a place, but one gets reconciled to it in time. I myself come from the neighbourhood of Dijon, and when I was appointed conservator of woods and rivers in this district, I found the place detestable, and thought I should be bored to death here. That was just before the Empire. After \u002751, the provinces were by no means cheerful places to live in, I assure you. In this department the folks were alarmed if they heard a dog bark, and they were ready to sink into the ground at the sight of a gendarme. But they calmed down by degrees, and resumed their old, monotonous, uneventful existences, and in the end I grew quite resigned to my life here. I live chiefly in the open air, I take long rides on horseback, and I have made a few pleasant friendships.\u0027 He lowered his voice, and continued confidentially: \u0027If you will take my advice, Monsieur l\u0027Abbé, you will be careful what you do. You can\u0027t imagine what a scrape I once nearly fell into. Plassans, you know, is divided into three absolutely distinct divisions: the old district, where your duties will be confined to administering consolation and alms; the district of Saint-Marc, where our aristocrats live, a district that is full of boredom and ill-feeling, and where you can\u0027t be too much upon your guard; and, lastly, the new town, the district which is now springing up round the Sub-Prefecture, and which is the only one where it is possible to live with any degree of comfort. At first I was foolish enough to take up my quarters in the Saint-Marc district, where I thought that my position required me to reside. There, alack! I found myself surrounded by a lot of withered old dowagers and mummified marquises. There wasn\u0027t an atom of sociability, not a scrap of gaiety, nothing but sulky mutiny against the prosperous peace that the country was enjoying. I only just missed compromising myself, upon my word I did. Péqueur used to chaff me, Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, our sub-prefect; you know him, don\u0027t you? Well, then I crossed the Cours Sauvaire, and took rooms on the Place. At Plassans, you must know, the people have no existence, and the aristocracy are a dreadful lot that it\u0027s quite impossible to get on with; the only tolerable folks are a few parvenus, some delightful persons who are ready to incur any expense in entertaining their official acquaintances. Our little circle of functionaries is a very delightful one. We live[Pg 60] amongst ourselves after our own inclinations, without caring a rap about the townspeople, just as if we had pitched our camp in some conquered country.\u0027 He laughed complacently, stretched himself further back in his chair, and turned up his feet to the fire; then he took a glass of punch from a tray which one of the servants handed to him, and sipped it slowly while still watching Abbé Faujas out of the corner of his eye. The latter felt that politeness required him to say something. \u0027This house seems a very pleasant one,\u0027 he remarked, turning slightly towards the green drawing-room, whence the sound of animated conversation was proceeding. \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 resumed Monsieur de Condamin, who checked his remarks every now and then to take a little sip of punch. \u0027The Rougons almost make us forget Paris. You would scarcely fancy here that you were in Plassans. It is the only pleasant and amusing drawing-room in the whole place, because it is the only one where all shades of opinion elbow one another. Péqueur, too, has very pleasant assemblies. It must cost the Rougons a lot of money, and they haven\u0027t the public purse behind them like Péqueur has; though they have something better still, the pockets of the taxpayers.\u0027 He seemed quite pleased with this witticism of his. He set his empty glass, which he had been holding in his hand, upon the mantelpiece, and then, drawing his chair near to Abbé Faujas and leaning towards him, he began to speak again: \u0027The most amusing comedies are continually being played here. But you ought to know the actors to appreciate them. You see Madame Rastoil over yonder between her two daughters—that lady of about forty-five with a head like a sheep\u0027s? Well, have you noticed how her eyelids trembled and blinked when Delangre came and sat down in front of her? Delangre is the man there on the left, with a likeness to Punch. They were acquainted intimately some ten years ago, and he is said to be the father of one of the girls, but it isn\u0027t known which. The funniest part of the business is that Delangre himself didn\u0027t get on very well with his wife about the same time; and people say that the father of his daughter is an artist very well known in Plassans.\u0027 Abbé Faujas had considered it his duty to assume a very serious expression on being made the recipient of such confidences as these, and he even closed his eyes and seemed to[Pg 61] hear nothing; while Monsieur de Condamin went on, as though in justification of himself: \u0027I allow myself to speak in this way of Delangre, as I know him so well. He is a wonderfully clever, pushing fellow. His father was a bricklayer, I believe. Fifteen years ago he used to take up the petty suits that other lawyers wouldn\u0027t be bothered with. Madame Rastoil extricated him from a condition of absolute penury; she supplied him even with wood in the winter-time to enable him to keep himself warm. It was through her influence that he won his first cases. It\u0027s worth mentioning that at that time Delangre had been shrewd enough to manifest no particular political proclivities; and so, in 1852, when people were looking out for a mayor, his name was at once thought of. He was the only man who could have been chosen without alarming one or other of the three divisions of the town. From that time everything has prospered with him, and he has a fine future before him. The only unfortunate part of the matter is that he doesn\u0027t get on very well with Péqueur; they are always wrangling about some silly trifles or other.\u0027 He broke off as he saw the tall young man, with whom he had been chatting previously, come up to him again. \u0027Monsieur Guillaume Porquier,\u0027 he said, introducing him to the Abbé, \u0027the son of Doctor Porquier.\u0027 Then, as Guillaume seated himself, he asked him with a touch of irony: \u0027Well! what did you see to admire over yonder?\u0027 \u0027Nothing at all, indeed!\u0027 replied the young man with a smile. \u0027I saw the Paloques. Madame Rougon always tries to hide them behind a curtain to prevent anything unpleasant happening. Paloque never takes his eyes off Monsieur Rastoil, hoping, no doubt, to kill him with suppressed terror. You know, of course, that the hideous fellow hopes to die presiding judge.\u0027 They both laughed. The ugliness of the Paloques was a perpetual source of amusement amongst the little circle of officials. Porquier\u0027s son lowered his voice as he continued: \u0027I saw Monsieur Bourdeu, too. Doesn\u0027t it strike you that he\u0027s ever so much thinner since the Marquis de Lagrifoul\u0027s election? Bourdeu will never get over the loss of his prefecture; he had put all his Orleanist rancour at the service of the Legitimists in the hope that that course would lead him straight to the Chamber, where he would be able to win back[Pg 62] that deeply-deplored prefecture. So he was horribly disgusted and hurt to find that instead of himself they chose the marquis, who is a perfect ass and hasn\u0027t the faintest notion of politics, whereas he, Bourdeu, is a very shrewd fellow.\u0027 \u0027That Bourdeu, with his tightly-buttoned frock-coat and broad-brimmed hat, is a most overbearing person,\u0027 said Monsieur de Condamin, shrugging his shoulders. \u0027If such people as he were allowed to have their own way they would turn France into a mere Sorbonne of lawyers and diplomatists, and would bore us all to death——Oh! by the way, Guillaume, I have been hearing about you. You seem to be leading a merry sort of life.\u0027 \u0027I?\u0027 exclaimed the young man with a smile. \u0027Yes, you, my fine fellow! and observe that I get my information from your father. He is much distressed about it: he accuses you of gambling and of staying out all night at the club and other places. Is it true that you have discovered a low café behind the gaol where you go with a company of scamps and play the devil\u0027s own game? I have even been told——\u0027 Here Monsieur de Condamin, observing two ladies enter the room, began to whisper in Guillaume\u0027s ear, while the young man replied with affirmative signs and shook with suppressed laughter. Then he bent forward in turn and whispered to Monsieur de Condamin, and the pair of them, drawing close together with brightly glistening eyes, seemed to derive a prolonged enjoyment from this private story, which could not be told in the presence of ladies. Abbé Faujas had remained where he was. He no longer listened to what was being said, but watched the many movements of Monsieur Delangre, who bustled about the green drawing-room trying to make himself extremely agreeable. The priest was so absorbed in his observations that he did not see Abbé Bourrette beckoning to him, so that the other had to come and touch his shoulder and ask him to follow. He then led him into the card-room with all the precaution of a man who has some very delicate communication to make. \u0027My dear friend,\u0027 he whispered, when they were alone in a quiet corner, \u0027it is excusable in you, as this is the first time you have been here, but I must warn you that you have compromised yourself very considerably by talking so long with the persons you have just left.\u0027 [Pg 63] Then, as Abbé Faujas looked at him with great surprise, he added: \u0027Those persons are not looked upon favourably. I myself am not passing any judgment upon them, and I don\u0027t want to repeat any scandal. I am simply warning you out of pure friendship, that\u0027s all.\u0027 He was going away, but Abbé Faujas detained him, exclaiming hastily: \u0027You disquiet me, my dear Monsieur Bourrette; I beg of you to explain yourself. Without speaking any ill of anyone, you can surely be a little clearer.\u0027 \u0027Well then,\u0027 replied the old priest, after a momentary hesitation, \u0027Doctor Porquier\u0027s son causes his worthy father the greatest distress, and sets the worst example to all the studious youth of Plassans. He left nothing but debts behind him in Paris, and here he is turning the whole town upside down. As for Monsieur de Condamin——\u0027 Here he hesitated again, feeling embarrassed by the enormity of what he had to relate; then, lowering his eyes, he resumed: \u0027Monsieur de Condamin is very free in his conversation, and I fear that he is deficient in a sense of morality. He spares no one, and he scandalises every honourable person. Then—I really hardly know how to tell you—but he has contracted, it is said, a scarcely creditable marriage. You see that young woman there, who is not thirty years old, and who has such a crowd around her? Well, he brought her to Plassans one day from no one knows where. From the time of her arrival she has been all-powerful here. It is she who has got her husband and Doctor Porquier decorated. She has influential friends in Paris. But I beg of you not to repeat any of this. Madame de Condamin is very amiable and charitable. I go to her house sometimes, and I should be extremely distressed if I thought that she considered me an enemy of hers. If she has committed faults, it is our duty—is it not?—to help her to return to a better way of life. As for her husband, he is, between ourselves, a perfect scamp. Have as little as possible to do with him.\u0027 Abbé Faujas gazed into the worthy Bourrette\u0027s eyes. He had just noticed that Madame Rougon was following their conversation from the distance with a thoughtful air. \u0027Wasn\u0027t it Madame Rougon who told you to come and give me this good advice?\u0027 he suddenly asked the old priest. [Pg 64] \u0027How did you know that?\u0027 the latter exclaimed in great astonishment. \u0027She asked me not to mention her name, but since you have guessed it—Ah! she is a good, kind-hearted lady who would be much distressed to see a priest compromising himself in her house. She is unfortunately compelled to receive all sorts of persons.\u0027 Abbé Faujas expressed his thanks, and promised to be more prudent in the future. The card-players had not taken any notice of the two priests, who returned into the big drawing-room, where Faujas was again conscious of hostile surroundings. He even experienced greater coldness and more silent contempt than before. The ladies pulled their dresses out of his way as though his touch would have soiled them, and the men turned away from him with sneering titters. He himself maintained haughty calmness and indifference. Fancying that he heard the word Besan?on meaningly pronounced in a corner of the room where Madame de Condamin was holding her court, he walked straight up to the folks by whom she was surrounded; but, at his approach, there was a dead silence amongst them, and they all stared him in the face with eyes that gleamed with uncharitable curiosity. He felt quite sure that they had been talking about him, and repeating some disgraceful story. While he was still standing there, behind the Rastoil young ladies, who had not observed him, he heard the younger one ask her sister: \u0027What was it that this priest, of whom everyone is talking, did at Besan?on?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t quite know,\u0027 the elder sister replied. \u0027I believe he nearly murdered his vicar in a quarrel they had. Papa also said that he had been mixed up in some great business speculation which turned out badly.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s in the small room over there, isn\u0027t he? Somebody saw him just now laughing with Monsieur de Condamin.\u0027 \u0027Oh! then people do quite right to distrust him if he laughs with Monsieur de Condamin.\u0027 This gossip of the two girls made perspiration start from Abbé Faujas\u0027s brows. He did not frown, but his lips tightened one upon the other, and his cheeks took an ashy tint. He seemed to hear the whole room talking of the priest whom he had tried to murder, and of the shady transactions in which he had been concerned. Opposite him were Monsieur Delangre and Doctor Porquier, still looking very severe; Monsieur de Bourdeu\u0027s[Pg 65] mouth pouted scornfully as he said something in a low voice to a lady; Monsieur Maffre, the justice of the peace, was casting furtive glances at him, as if he had piously resolved to examine him from a distance before condemning him; and at the other end of the room the two hideous Paloques craned out their malice-warped faces, in which shone a wicked joy at all the cruel stories that were being whispered about. Abbé Faujas slowly retired as he saw Madame Rastoil, who had been standing a few paces away, come up and seat herself between her two daughters, as though to keep them under the protection of her wing and shield them from his touch. He rested his elbow on the piano which he saw behind him, and there he stood with his head erect and his face as hard and silent as a face of stone. He felt that they were all in a plot to treat him as an outcast. As he stood thus gazing at the company from under his partially lowered eyelids he suddenly gave a slight start, which he quickly suppressed. He had just caught sight of Abbé Fenil, leaning back in an easy-chair and smiling quietly behind a perfect wall of petticoats. The eyes of the two men met, and they gazed at each other for some moments with the fierce expression of duellists about to engage in mortal combat. Then there was a rustling of silk, and Abbé Fenil was hidden from sight by the ladies\u0027 gowns. However, Félicité had contrived to reach the neighbourhood of the piano, and when she had succeeded in installing at it the elder of the Rastoil girls, who had a pleasant voice, and was able to speak to Abbé Faujas without being heard, she drew him towards one of the windows and asked: \u0027What have you done to Abbé Fenil?\u0027 They talked together in very low tones. The priest at first feigned surprise, but when Madame Rougon had murmured a few words, accompanied by sundry shruggings of her shoulders, he seemed to become more open with her. They both smiled, and made a pretence of merely exchanging ordinary courtesies, but the glistening of their eyes spoke of something much more serious. The piano was silent for a moment, and then the elder Mademoiselle Rastoil began to sing \u0027La Colombe du Soldat,\u0027 which was a favourite song at that time. \u0027Your début has been most unfortunate,\u0027 Félicité continued. \u0027You have quite set people against you, and I should advise you not to come here again for a considerable time.[Pg 66] You must make yourself popular and a favourite, you understand. Any rash act would be fatal.\u0027 Abbé Faujas seemed absorbed in thought. \u0027You say that it was Abbé Fenil who circulated these abominable stories?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Oh, he is much too wily to commit himself in such a way. He must just have faintly suggested them to his penitents. I don\u0027t know whether he has found you out, but he is certainly afraid of you. I am sure of that. And he will attack you in every possible way. The most unfortunate part of the matter is that he confesses the most important people in the town. It was he who secured the election of the Marquis de Lagrifoul.\u0027 \u0027I did wrong to come this evening,\u0027 the priest murmured. Félicité bit her lips, then continued with animation: \u0027You did wrong to compromise yourself with such a man as that Condamin. I did what I thought was best. When the person whom you know of wrote to me from Paris I thought that I should be doing you a service by inviting you here. I imagined that you would be able to make it an opportunity for gaining friends. But, instead of doing what you could to make yourself popular, you have set everyone against you. Please excuse my freedom, but you really seem to be doing all you can to ensure your failure. You have committed nothing but mistakes: in going to lodge with my son-in-law, in persistently keeping yourself aloof from others, and in walking about in a cassock which makes the street-lads jeer at you.\u0027 Abbé Faujas could not repress a movement of impatience. However, he merely replied: \u0027I will profit by your kind advice. Only, don\u0027t try to assist me; that would mar everything.\u0027 \u0027Yes, what you say is prudent,\u0027 replied the old lady. \u0027Only return here in triumph. One last word, my dear sir. The person in Paris is most anxious for your success, and it is for that reason that I am interesting myself in you. Well, then, don\u0027t make people frightened of you—shun you; be pleasant, and make yourself agreeable to the ladies. Remember that particularly. You must make yourself agreeable to the ladies if you want to get Plassans on your side.\u0027 The elder Mademoiselle Rastoil had just finished her song with a final flourish, and the guests were softly applauding her. Madame Rougon left the Abbé to go and congratulate[Pg 67] the singer. Then she took up a position in the middle of the room, and shook hands with the visitors who were beginning to retire. It was eleven o\u0027clock. The Abbé was much vexed to find that the worthy Bourrette had taken advantage of the music to effect his escape. He had thought of leaving with him—a course which would have enabled him to make a respectable exit. Now, however, he would have to go away alone, which would be extremely prejudicial to him. It would be reported through the town in the morning that he had been turned out of the house. So he retired into a window-recess, whence he watched for an opportunity to effect an honourable retreat. The room was emptying fast, however, and there were only a few ladies left. At last he noticed one who was very simply dressed; it was Madame Mouret, whose slightly waved hair made her look younger than usual. He looked with surprise at her tranquil face and her large, peaceful black eyes. He had not noticed her during the evening; she had quietly remained in the same corner without moving, vexed at wasting her time in this way, with her hands in her lap, doing nothing. While he was looking at her she rose to take leave of her mother. It was one of Félicité\u0027s greatest delights to see the high society of Plassans leave her with profuse bows and thanks for her punch, her green drawing-room, and the pleasant evening they had spent there; and she thought how, formerly, these same fine folks had trampled her underfoot, whereas now the richest amongst them could not find sweet enough smiles for \u0027dear Madame Rougon.\u0027 \u0027Ah, madame!\u0027 murmured Maffre, the justice of the peace, \u0027one quite forgets the passage of time here.\u0027 \u0027You are the only pleasant hostess in all this uncivilised place,\u0027 whispered pretty Madame de Condamin. \u0027We shall expect you to dinner to-morrow,\u0027 said Monsieur Delangre; \u0027but you must take pot-luck, for we don\u0027t pretend to do as you do.\u0027 Marthe was obliged to make her way through all this incense-offering crowd in order to reach her mother. She kissed her, and was about to retire, when Félicité detained her and looked around as if to trying to find someone. Then on catching sight of Abbé Faujas, she inquired, with a smile: \u0027Is your reverence a gallant man?\u0027 The Abbé bowed. [Pg 68] \u0027Well, then, I should be much obliged to you if you would escort my daughter home. You both live in the same house, and so it will not put you to any inconvenience. On the road there is a little bit of dark lane which is not very pleasant for a lady by herself.\u0027 Marthe assured her mother, in her quiet way, that she was not a little girl, and in no wise felt afraid; but as Félicité insisted, saying that she should feel easier if her daughter had someone with her, she at last accepted the Abbé\u0027s escort. As the latter retired with her, Félicité, who accompanied them to the landing, whispered in the priest\u0027s ear, with a smile: \u0027Don\u0027t forget what I told you. You must make yourself agreeable to the ladies if you want Plassans to belong to you.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58404.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
