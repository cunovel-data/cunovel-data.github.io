{"id":29444,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER 21","content":"The Toulon coach, which passed through Les Tulettes, where it changed horses, left Plassans at three o\u0027clock. Marthe, goaded on by a fixed, unswerving resolve, was anxious not to lose a moment. She put on her shawl and hat, and ordered Rose to dress immediately. \u0027I can\u0027t tell what madame\u0027s after,\u0027 said the cook to Olympe: \u0027but I fancy we\u0027re going away for some days.\u0027 Marthe left the keys in the cupboard doors; she was in a hurry to be off. Olympe, who went with her to the front door, vainly tried to ascertain where she was going and how long she would be away. \u0027Well, make yourself quite easy,\u0027 she said to her in her pleasant way, as they parted; \u0027I will look after everything, you will find things all right when you come back. Don\u0027t hurry yourself, take the time to do all you want. If you go to Marseilles, bring us back some fresh shell-fish.\u0027 Before Marthe had turned the corner of the Rue Taravelle, Olympe had taken possession of the whole house. When Trouche came home he found his wife banging the doors and examining the contents of the drawers and closets, as she hummed and sang and rushed about the rooms. \u0027She\u0027s gone off and taken that beast of a cook with her,\u0027 she cried to him as she lolled into an easy-chair. \u0027What luck it would be if they should both get upset into a ditch and stop there! Well, we must enjoy ourselves for as long as we have the chance. It\u0027s very nice being alone, isn\u0027t it, Honoré? Come and give me a kiss! We are quite by ourselves now, and we can do just as we like.\u0027 Marthe and Rose reached the Cours Sauvaire only just in[Pg 293] time to catch the Toulon coach. The coupé was disengaged. When the cook heard her mistress tell the conductor to set them down at Les Tulettes, she took her place with an expression of vexation, and before the coach had got out of the town she had begun grumbling in her cross-grained fashion. \u0027Well, I did think that you were at last going to behave sensibly! I felt sure that we were going to Marseilles to see Monsieur Octave. We could have brought back a lobster and some oysters. Ah! I shouldn\u0027t have hurried myself so if I had known. But it\u0027s just like you. You are always hunting after troubles, and always doing things that upset you.\u0027 Marthe was lying back in her corner in a semi-conscious condition. Now that she was no longer stiffening herself against the pains which oppressed her heart, a death-like faintness was creeping over her. But the cook did not even look towards her. \u0027Did anyone ever hear of such an absurd idea as going to see the master?\u0027 she continued. \u0027A cheerful sort of sight it will be for us. We sha\u0027n\u0027t be able to sleep for a week after it. You may be as frightened as you like at nights, now; you won\u0027t get me to come and look under the furniture for you. It isn\u0027t as though your going to see him could do the master any good. He\u0027s just as likely to fly at your face as not! I hope to goodness that they won\u0027t let you see him. It\u0027s against the rules, I know. I ought not to have got into the coach when I heard you mention Les Tulettes, for I don\u0027t think you would have ventured to go on such a foolish errand all by yourself.\u0027 A deep sigh from Marthe checked her flow of words. She turned round to her mistress, saw her pale and suffocating, and grew still angrier than before as she opened the window to let in some fresh air. \u0027There now, you\u0027ll have to come and lie in my arms! Don\u0027t you think you\u0027d have been ever so much better in bed, taking care of yourself? To think that you have had the good fortune to be surrounded by pious, holy people without being the least bit grateful to God Almighty for it! You know it\u0027s only the truth I\u0027m saying. His reverence the Curé and his mother and sister, and even Monsieur Trouche himself, are all attention towards you. They would throw themselves into the fire for you; they are ready to do anything at any hour of the day or night. I saw Madame Olympe crying—yes,[Pg 294] crying—the last time you were ill. And what sort of gratitude do you show them for all their kindness and attention? Why, you do all you can to distress them, and set off on the sly to see the master, although you know quite well that you will grieve them dreadfully by doing so, for it\u0027s impossible that they should be fond of the master, who treated you so cruelly. I\u0027ll tell you what, madame—marriage has done you no good; you\u0027ve got infected with all the master\u0027s bad nature. There are times when you are every bit as bad as he is.\u0027 All the way to Les Tulettes she continued in this strain, eulogising the Faujases and the Trouches, and accusing her mistress of every kind of wrong-doing. And she concluded by saying: \u0027Ah, they are the sort of people who would make excellent masters if they could only afford to keep servants. But fortune merely comes in the way of bad-hearted folks!\u0027 Marthe, who was now calmer, made no reply. She gazed out of the window, watching the scraggy trees and the wide-stretching fields which spread out like great lengths of brown cloth. Rose\u0027s growlings were lost amidst the noisy jolting of the coach. When they reached Les Tulettes, Marthe hastened towards the house of her uncle Macquart, followed by the cook, who had now subsided into silence, contenting herself by shrugging her shoulders and biting her lips. \u0027Hallo! is that you?\u0027 cried the uncle in great surprise. \u0027I thought you were in your bed. I heard that you were very ill. Well, my little dear, you really don\u0027t look very strong. Have you come to ask me for some dinner?\u0027 \u0027I should like to see Fran?ois, uncle,\u0027 said Marthe. \u0027Fran?ois?\u0027 repeated Macquart, looking her in the face. \u0027You would like to see Fran?ois? It is a very kind thought of yours. The poor fellow has been crying for you a great deal. I have seen him from the end of my garden knocking his fist against the walls while he called for you to come to him. And so it is to see him that you have come, eh? I really thought that you had forgotten all about him over yonder.\u0027 Big tears welled into Marthe\u0027s eyes. \u0027It will not be very easy to see him to-day,\u0027 Macquart continued. \u0027It is getting on for four o\u0027clock, and I\u0027m not at all sure that the manager will give you leave. Mouret hasn\u0027t[Pg 295] been very quiet lately. He smashes everything that he can lay his hands on, and talks about burning the place down. Those madmen are not in a pleasant humour every day.\u0027 Marthe trembled as she listened to her uncle; she was going to question him, but instead of doing so she merely stretched out her hands supplicatingly. \u0027I beseech you to help me,\u0027 said she. \u0027I have come on purpose. It is absolutely necessary that I should speak to Fran?ois to-day, at once. You have friends in the asylum, and you can obtain me admission.\u0027 \u0027No doubt, no doubt,\u0027 he replied, without committing himself further. He appeared to be in a state of great perplexity, unable to divine the real cause of Marthe\u0027s sudden journey, and revolving the matter in his own mind from a point of view known only to himself. He glanced inquisitively at the cook, who turned her back upon him. At last a slight smile began to play about his lips. \u0027Well,\u0027 he said, \u0027since you wish it, I will see what I can do for you. Only, remember, that if your mother is displeased about it, you must tell her that I was not able to dissuade you. I am afraid that you may do yourself harm; it isn\u0027t a pleasant place to visit.\u0027 Rose absolutely declined to accompany them to the asylum. She had seated herself in front of a fire of vine-stocks, which was blazing on the great hearth. \u0027I don\u0027t want to have my eyes torn out,\u0027 she said snappishly. \u0027The master isn\u0027t over fond of me. I would rather stop here and warm myself.\u0027 \u0027It would be very good of you if you were to get us some mulled wine ready,\u0027 Macquart whispered in her ear. \u0027The wine and sugar are in the cupboard yonder. We shall want it when we come back.\u0027 Macquart did not take his niece to the principal gate of the asylum. He went round to the left and inquired at a little door for warder Alexandre, with whom, on his appearance, he exchanged a few words in a low voice. Then they all three silently entered the seemingly interminable corridors. The warder walked in front. \u0027I will wait for you here,\u0027 said Macquart, coming to a halt in a little courtyard. \u0027Alexandre will remain with you.\u0027 \u0027I would rather be left alone,\u0027 said Marthe. \u0027Madame would very quickly have enough of it, if she[Pg 296] were,\u0027 Alexandre replied, with a tranquil smile. \u0027I\u0027m running a good deal of risk as it is.\u0027 He took Marthe through another court, and stopped in front of a little door. As he softly turned the key, he said in a low voice: \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid. He has been quieter to-day, and they have been able to take the strait-waistcoat off. If he shows any violence you must step out backwards, and leave me alone with him.\u0027 Marthe trembled as she passed through the narrow doorway. At first she could only see something lying in a heap against the wall in one of the corners. The daylight was waning, and the cell was merely lighted by a pale glimmer which fell from a grated window. \u0027Well, my fine fellow!\u0027 Alexandre exclaimed familiarly, as he stepped up to Mouret and tapped him on the shoulder; \u0027I am bringing you a visitor. I hope you will behave properly.\u0027 Then he returned and leant against the door, keeping his eyes fixed upon the madman. Mouret slowly rose to his feet. He did not show the slightest sign of surprise. \u0027Is it you, my dear?\u0027 he said in his quiet voice. \u0027I was expecting you; I was getting uneasy about the children.\u0027 Marthe\u0027s knees trembled under her, and she looked at him anxiously, rendered quite speechless by his affectionate reception. He did not appear changed at all. If anything, he looked better than he had done before. He was sleek and plump, and cleanly shaved. His eyes, too, were bright; all his former little mannerisms had reappeared, and he rubbed his hands and winked, and stalked about with his old bantering air. \u0027I am very well indeed, my dear. We can go back home together. You have come for me, haven\u0027t you? I hope the garden has been well looked after. The slugs were dreadfully fond of the lettuces, and the beds were quite eaten up with them, but I know a way of destroying them. I have some splendid ideas in my head that I\u0027ll tell you of. We are very comfortably off, and we can afford to pay for our fancies. By the way, have you seen old Gautier of Saint-Eutrope while I\u0027ve been absent? I bought thirty hogsheads of common wine from him for blending. I must go and see him to-morrow. You never recollect anything.\u0027 He spoke in a jesting way, and shook his finger at her playfully. [Pg 297] \u0027I\u0027ll be bound that I shall find everything in dreadful disorder,\u0027 he continued. \u0027You never look after anything. The tools will be all lying about, the cupboard doors will be open, and Rose will be dirtying the rooms with her broom. Why hasn\u0027t Rose come with you? Ah, what a strange creature she is! Do you know, she actually wanted to turn me out of the house one day? Really, she seems to think that the whole place belongs to her. She goes on in the most amusing way possible. But you don\u0027t tell me anything about the children. Désirée is still with her nurse, I suppose. We will go and kiss her and see if she is tired of staying there. And I want to go to Marseilles as well, for I am a little uneasy about Octave. The last time I was there I found him leading a wild life. As for Serge, I have no anxiety about him; he is almost too quiet and steady. He will sanctify the whole family. Ah! I quite enjoy talking about the house and the children.\u0027 He rattled along at great length, inquiring about every tree in his garden, going into the minutest details of the household arrangements, and showing an extraordinary memory of a host of insignificant matters. Marthe was deeply touched by the gentle affection which he manifested for her. She thought she could detect a loving delicacy in the care which he took to say nothing that savoured of reproach, to make no allusion, however slight, to all that had passed. She felt, indeed, that she was forgiven, and she vowed that she would atone for her crime by becoming the submissive servant of this man who was so sublime in his good nature. Big silent tears rolled down her cheeks, and her knees bent under her in her gratitude. \u0027Take care!\u0027 the warder whispered in her ear. \u0027I don\u0027t like the look of his eyes.\u0027 \u0027But he isn\u0027t mad!\u0027 she stammered; \u0027I swear to you that he isn\u0027t mad! I must speak to the manager. I want to take him away with me at once.\u0027 \u0027Take care!\u0027 the warder repeated sharply, pulling her by her arm. Mouret had suddenly stopped short in the midst of his chatter, and was now crouching upon the floor. Then, all at once, he began to crawl along beside the wall, on his hands and knees. \u0027Wow! wow!\u0027 he barked in hoarse, prolonged notes. He gave a spring into the air and fell upon his side.[Pg 298] Then a dreadful scene ensued. He began to writhe like a worm, beat his face with his fist, and tore his flesh with his nails. In a short time he was half naked, his clothes in rags, and himself bruised and lacerated and groaning. \u0027Come away, madame, come away!\u0027 cried the warder. Marthe stood rooted to the floor. She recognised in the scene before her her own writhings at home. It was in that way that she had thrown herself upon the floor of her bedroom; it was in that way that she had beaten and torn herself. She even recognised the very tones of her voice. Mouret vented the same rattling groan. It was she who had brought the poor man into this miserable state. \u0027He is not mad!\u0027 she stammered; \u0027he cannot be mad, it would be too horrible! I would rather die!\u0027 The warder put his arm round her and pushed her out of the cell, but she remained leaning against the door on the other side. She could hear a terrible struggle going on within, screams like those of a pig being slaughtered; then a dull fall like that of a bundle of damp linen, and afterwards death-like silence. When the warder came out of the cell, the night had nearly fallen. Through the partially open doorway, Marthe could see nothing. \u0027Well, upon my word, madame,\u0027 cried the warder, \u0027you are a very queer person to say that he is not mad. I nearly left my thumb behind me; he got firmly hold of it between his teeth. However, he\u0027s quieted now for a few hours.\u0027 And as he took her back to her uncle, he continued: \u0027You\u0027ve no idea how cunning they all are. They are as quiet as can be for hours together, and talk to you in quite a sensible manner; and then, without the least warning, they fly at your throat. I could see very well that he was up to some mischief or other just now when he was talking to you about the children, for there was such a strange look in his eyes.\u0027 When Marthe got back to Macquart, in the small courtyard, she exclaimed feverishly in a weak, broken voice: \u0027He is mad! he is mad!\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s no doubt he\u0027s mad,\u0027 said her uncle with a snigger. \u0027Why, what did you expect to find? People are not brought here for nothing. And the place isn\u0027t healthy either. If I were to be shut up there for a couple of hours, I should go mad myself.\u0027 He was watching her askance, and he noted her nervous[Pg 299] start and shudder. Then, in his good-natured way, he said: \u0027Perhaps you would like to go and see the grandmother?\u0027 Marthe made a gesture of terror, and hid her face in her hands. \u0027It would be no trouble to anyone,\u0027 he said. \u0027Alexandre would be glad to take us. She is over yonder, on that side, and there is nothing to be afraid of with her. She is perfectly quiet. She never gives any trouble, does she, Alexandre? She always remains seated and gazing in front of her. She hasn\u0027t moved for the last dozen years. However, if you\u0027d rather not see her, we won\u0027t go.\u0027[7] As the warder was taking his leave of them, Macquart invited him to come and drink a glass of mulled wine, winking the while in a certain fashion which seemed to induce Alexandre to accept the invitation. They were obliged to support Marthe, whose legs sank beneath her at each step. When they reached the house, they were actually carrying her. Her face was convulsed, her eyes were staring widely, and her whole body was rigidly stiffened by one of those nervous seizures which kept her like a dead woman for hours at a time. \u0027There! what did I tell you?\u0027 cried Rose, when she saw them. \u0027A nice state she\u0027s in! How are we to get home, I should like to know? Good heavens! how can people take such absurd fancies into their heads? The master ought to have given her neck a twist, and it would have taught her a lesson, perhaps.\u0027 \u0027Pooh!\u0027 said Macquart; \u0027I\u0027ll lay her down on my bed. It won\u0027t kill us if we have to sit up round the fire all night.\u0027 He drew aside a calico curtain which hung in front of a recess. Rose proceeded to undress her mistress, growling as she did so. The only thing they could do, she said, was to put a hot brick at her feet. \u0027Now that she\u0027s all snug, we\u0027ll have a drop to drink,\u0027 resumed Macquart, with his wolfish snigger. \u0027That wine of yours smells awfully nice, old lady!\u0027 \u0027I found a lemon on the mantelpiece,\u0027 Rose said, \u0027and I used it.\u0027 \u0027You did quite right. There is everything here that is[Pg 300] wanted. When I make a brew, there\u0027s nothing missing that ought to be in the place, I assure you.\u0027 He pulled the table in front of the fire, and then he sat down between Rose and Alexandre, and poured the hot wine into some big yellow cups. When he had swallowed a couple of mouthfuls with great gusto, he smacked his lips and cried: \u0027Ah! that\u0027s first-rate. You understand how to make it. It\u0027s really better than what I make myself. You must leave me your recipe.\u0027 Rose, greatly mollified by these compliments, began to laugh. The vine-wood fire was now a great mass of glowing embers. The cups were filled again. \u0027And so,\u0027 said Macquart, leaning on his elbows and looking Rose in the face, \u0027it was a sudden whim of my niece to come here?\u0027 \u0027Oh, don\u0027t talk about it,\u0027 replied the cook; \u0027it will make me angry again. Madame is getting as mad as the master. She can no longer tell who are her friends and who are not. I believe she had a quarrel with his reverence the Curé before she set off; I heard them shouting.\u0027 Macquart laughed noisily. \u0027They used, however, to get on very well together,\u0027 said he. \u0027Yes, indeed; but nothing lasts long with such a brain as madame has got. I\u0027ll be bound that she\u0027s now regretting the thrashings the master used to give her at nights. We found his stick in the garden.\u0027 Macquart looked at her more keenly, and, as he drank his hot wine, he said: \u0027Perhaps she came to take Fran?ois back with her.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Heaven forbid!\u0027 cried Rose, with an expression of horror. \u0027The master would go on finely in the house; he would kill us all. The idea of his return is one of my greatest dreads; I\u0027m in a constant worry lest he should make his escape and get back some night and murder us all. When I think about it when I\u0027m in bed, I can\u0027t go to sleep. I fancy I can see him stealing in through the window with his hair bristling and his eyes flaming like matches.\u0027 This made Macquart very merry, and he rapped his cup on the table. \u0027It would be very unpleasant,\u0027 he said, \u0027very unpleasant. I don\u0027t suppose he feels very kindly towards you, least of all[Pg 301] towards the Curé who has stepped into his place. The Curé would only make a mouthful for him, big as he is, for madmen, they say, are awfully strong. I say, Alexandre, just imagine poor Fran?ois suddenly making his appearance at home! He would make a pretty clean sweep there, wouldn\u0027t he? It would be a fine sight, eh?\u0027 He cast glances at the warder, who went on quietly drinking his mulled wine and made no reply beyond nodding his head assentingly. \u0027Oh! it\u0027s only a fancy; it\u0027s all nonsense,\u0027 added Macquart, as he observed Rose\u0027s terrified looks. Just at that moment, Marthe began to struggle violently behind the calico curtain; and she had to be held for some minutes in order that she might not fall upon the floor. When she was again stretched out in corpse-like rigidity, her uncle came and warmed his legs before the fire, reflecting and murmuring as if without paying heed to what he said: \u0027The little woman isn\u0027t very easy to manage, indeed.\u0027 Then he suddenly exclaimed: \u0027The Rougons, now, what do they say about all this business? They take the Curé\u0027s side, don\u0027t they?\u0027 \u0027The master didn\u0027t make himself pleasant enough for them to regret him,\u0027 replied Rose. \u0027There was nothing too bad for him to say against them.\u0027 \u0027Well, he wasn\u0027t far wrong there,\u0027 said Macquart. \u0027The Rougons are wretched skinflints. Just think that they refused to buy that cornfield over yonder, a magnificent speculation which I undertook to manage. Félicité would pull a queer face if she saw Fran?ois come back!\u0027 He began to snigger again, and took a turn round the table. Then, with an expression of determination, he lighted his pipe. \u0027We mustn\u0027t forget the time, my boy,\u0027 he said to Alexandre, with another wink. \u0027I will go back with you; Marthe seems quiet now. Rose will get the table laid by the time I return. You must be hungry, Rose, eh? As you are obliged to stay the night here, you shall have a mouthful with me.\u0027 He went off with the warder, and fully half an hour elapsed. Rose, who began to tire of being alone, at last opened the door and went out to the terrace, where she stood watching the deserted road in the clear night air. As she[Pg 302] was going back into the house, she fancied she could see two dark shadows in the middle of a path behind a hedge. \u0027It looks just like the uncle,\u0027 thought she; \u0027he seems to be talking to a priest.\u0027 A few minutes later Macquart returned. That blessed Alexandre, said he, had been chattering to him interminably. \u0027Wasn\u0027t it you who were over there just now with a priest?\u0027 asked Rose. \u0027I, with a priest!\u0027 he cried. \u0027Why, you must have been dreaming; there isn\u0027t a priest in the neighbourhood.\u0027 He rolled his little glistening eyes. Then, as if rather uneasy about the lie he had told, he added: \u0027Well, there is Abbé Fenil, but it\u0027s just the same as if he wasn\u0027t here, for he never goes out.\u0027 \u0027Abbé Fenil isn\u0027t up to much,\u0027 remarked the cook. This seemed to annoy Macquart. \u0027Why do you say that? Not up to much, eh? He does a great deal of good here, and he\u0027s a very worthy sort of fellow. He\u0027s worth a whole heap of priests who make a lot of fuss.\u0027 His irritation, however, promptly disappeared, and he began to laugh upon observing that Rose was looking at him in surprise. \u0027I was only joking, you know,\u0027 he said. \u0027You are quite right; he\u0027s like all the other priests, they are all a set of hypocrites. I know now who it was that you saw me with. I met our grocer\u0027s wife. She was wearing a black dress, and you must have mistaken that for a cassock.\u0027 Rose made an omelet, and Macquart placed some cheese upon the table. They had not finished eating when Marthe sat up in bed with the astonished look of a person awaking in a strange place. When she had brushed aside her hair and recollected where she was, she sprang to the floor and said she must be off at once. Macquart appeared very much vexed at her awaking. \u0027It\u0027s quite impossible,\u0027 said he, \u0027for you to go back to Plassans to-night. You are shivering with fever, and you would fall ill on the road. Rest here, and we will see about it to-morrow. To begin with, there is no conveyance.\u0027 \u0027But you can drive me in your trap,\u0027 said Marthe. \u0027No, no; I can\u0027t.\u0027 Marthe, who was dressing with feverish haste, thereupon declared that she would walk to Plassans rather than stay the[Pg 303] night at Les Tulettes. Her uncle seemed to be thinking. He had locked the door and slipped the key into his pocket. He entreated his niece, threatened her, and invented all kinds of stories to induce her to remain. But she paid no attention to what he said, and finished by putting on her bonnet. \u0027You are very much mistaken if you imagine you can persuade her to give in,\u0027 exclaimed Rose, who was quietly finishing her cheese. \u0027She would get out through the window first. You had better put your horse to the trap.\u0027 After a short interval of silence, Macquart, shrugging his shoulders, angrily exclaimed: \u0027Well, it makes no difference to me! Let her lay herself up if she likes! I was only thinking about her own good. Come along; what will happen will happen. I\u0027ll drive you over.\u0027 Marthe had to be carried to the gig; she was trembling violently with fever. Her uncle threw an old cloak over her shoulders. Then he gave a cluck with his tongue and set off. \u0027It\u0027s no trouble to me,\u0027 he said, \u0027to go over to Plassans this evening; on the contrary, indeed, there\u0027s always some amusement to be had there.\u0027 It was about ten o\u0027clock. In the sky, heavy with rain clouds, there was a ruddy glimmer that cast a feeble light upon the road. All the way as they drove along Macquart kept bending forward and glancing at the ditches and the hedges. When Rose asked him what he was looking for, he replied that some wolves had come down from the ravines of La Seille. He had quite recovered his good humour. However, when they were between two and three miles from Plassans the rain began to fall. It poured down, cold and pelting. Then Macquart began to swear, and Rose would have liked to beat her mistress, who was moaning underneath the cloak. When at last they reached Plassans the rain had ceased, and the sky was blue again. \u0027Are you going to the Rue Balande?\u0027 asked Macquart. \u0027Why, of course,\u0027 replied Rose in astonishment. Macquart thereupon began to explain that as Marthe seemed to him to be very ill, he had thought it might perhaps be better to take her to her mother\u0027s. After much hesitation, however, he consented to stop his horse at the Mourets\u0027 house. Marthe had not even thought of bringing a latchkey with her. Rose, however, fortunately had her own in her pocket, but when she tried to open the door it would not move. The Trouches had shot the bolts inside. She rapped upon it[Pg 304] with her fist, but without rousing any other answer than a dull echo in the hall. \u0027It\u0027s of no use your giving yourself any further trouble,\u0027 said Macquart with a laugh. \u0027They won\u0027t disturb themselves to come down. Well, here you are shut out of your own home. Don\u0027t you think now that my first idea was a good one? We must take the poor child to the Rougons\u0027. She will be better there than in her own room; I assure you she will.\u0027 Félicité was overwhelmed with alarm when she saw her daughter arrive at such a late hour, drenched with rain and apparently half dead. She put her to bed on the second floor, set the house in great commotion, and called up all the servants. When she grew a little calmer, as she sat by Marthe\u0027s bedside, she asked for an explanation. \u0027What has happened? How is it that you have brought her to me in such a state as this?\u0027 Then Macquart, with a great show of kindness, told her about \u0027the dear child\u0027s\u0027 expedition. He defended himself, declared that he had done all that he could to dissuade her from going to see Fran?ois, and ended by calling upon Rose to confirm him, for he saw that Félicité was scanning him narrowly with her suspicious eyes. Madame Rougon, however, continued to shake her head. \u0027It is a very strange story!\u0027 she said; \u0027there is something more in it than I can understand.\u0027 She knew Macquart, and she guessed that there must be some rascality in it all from the expression of delight which she could detect in his eyes. \u0027You are a strange person,\u0027 said he, pretending to get vexed in order to bring Madame Rougon\u0027s scrutiny to an end; \u0027you are always imagining something extraordinary. I can only tell you what I know. I love Marthe more than you do, and I have never done anything that wasn\u0027t for her good. Shall I go for the doctor? I will at once, if you like.\u0027 Madame Rougon watched him closely. She even questioned Rose at great length, without succeeding, however, in learning anything further. After all, she seemed glad to have her daughter with her, and spoke with great bitterness of people who would leave you to die on your own doorstep without even taking the trouble to open the door. And meantime Marthe, with her head thrown back upon her pillow, was indeed dying.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58419.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
