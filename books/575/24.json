{"id":29446,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER 23","content":"Macquart did not find Porquier at home, and so the doctor only reached Madame Rougon\u0027s at nearly half-past twelve. The whole house was still in commotion. Rougon himself was the only one who had not got out of bed. Emotion had a killing effect upon him, said he. Félicité, who was still seated in the same armchair by Marthe\u0027s bedside, rose to meet the doctor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, my dear doctor, we are so very anxious!\u0027 she murmured. \u0027The poor child has never stirred since we put her to bed there. Her hands are already quite cold. I have kept them in my own, but it has done no good.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Doctor Porquier scanned Marthe\u0027s face, and then, without making any further examination, he compressed his lips and made a vague gesture with his hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027My dear Madame Rougon,\u0027 he said, \u0027you must summon up your courage.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Félicité burst into sobs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The end is at hand,\u0027 the doctor continued in a lower voice. \u0027I have been expecting this sad termination for a long time past; I must confess so much now. Both of poor Madame Mouret\u0027s lungs are diseased, and in her case phthisis has been complicated by nervous derangement.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He took a seat, and a smile played about his lips, the[Pg 317] smile of the polished doctor who thinks that even in the presence of death itself suave politeness is demanded of him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t give way and make yourself ill, my dear lady. The catastrophe was inevitable and any little accident might have hastened it. I should imagine that poor Madame Mouret must have been subject to coughing when she was very young; wasn\u0027t she? I should say that the germs of the disease have been spreading within her for a good many years past. Latterly, and especially within the last three years, phthisis has been making frightful strides in her. How pious and devotional she was! I have been quite touched to see her passing away in such sanctity. Well, well, the decrees of Providence are inscrutable; science is very often quite powerless.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Seeing that Madame Rougon still continued to weep, he poured out upon her the tenderest consolations, and pressed her to take a cup of lime-flower water to calm herself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t distress yourself, I beg you,\u0027 he continued. \u0027I assure you that she has lost all sense of pain. She will continue sleeping as tranquilly as she is doing at present, and will only regain consciousness just before death. I won\u0027t leave you; I will remain here, though my services are quite unavailing. I shall stay, however, as a friend, my dear lady, as a friend.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He settled himself comfortably for the night in an easy chair. Félicité grew a little calmer. When Doctor Porquier gave her to understand that Marthe had only a few more hours to live, she thought of sending for Serge from the Seminary, which was near at hand. She asked Rose to go there for him, but the cook at first refused. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do you want to kill the poor little fellow as well?\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027It would be too great a shock for him to be called up in the middle of the night to come to see a dead woman. I won\u0027t be his murderer!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Rose still retained bitter feelings against her mistress. Ever since the latter had been lying there dying she had paced round the bed, angrily knocking about the cups and the hot-water bottles. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Was there any sense in doing such a thing as madame did?\u0027 she cried. \u0027She has only herself to blame if she has got her death by going to see the master. And now everything is turned topsy-turvy and we are all distracted. No,[Pg 318] no; I don\u0027t approve at all of the little fellow being startled out of his sleep in such a way.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n In the end, however, she consented to go to the Seminary. Doctor Porquier had stretched himself out in front of the fire, and with half-closed eyes continued to address consolatory words to Madame Rougon. A slight rattling sound began to be heard in Marthe\u0027s chest. Uncle Macquart, who had not appeared again since he had gone away two good hours previously, now gently pushed the door open. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where have you been?\u0027 Félicité asked him, taking him into a corner of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n He told her that he had been to put his horse and trap up at The Three Pigeons. But his eyes sparkled so vividly, and there was such a look of diabolical cunning about him, that she was filled with a thousand suspicions. She forgot her dying daughter for the moment, for she scented some trickery which it was imperative for her to get to the bottom of. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Anyone would imagine that you had been following and playing the spy upon somebody,\u0027 she said, looking at his muddy trousers. \u0027You are hiding something from me, Macquart. It is not right of you. We have always treated you very well.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, very well, indeed!\u0027 sniggered Macquart. \u0027I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve told me so. Rougon is a skinflint. He treated me like the lowest of the low in the matter of that cornfield. Where is Rougon? Snoozing comfortably in his bed, eh? It\u0027s little he cares for all the trouble one takes about the family.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The smile which accompanied these last words greatly disquieted Félicité. She looked him keenly in the face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What trouble have you taken for the family?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Do you grudge having brought poor Marthe back from Les Tulettes? I tell you again that all that business has a very suspicious look. I have been questioning Rose, and it seems to me that you wanted to come straight here. It surprises me that you did not knock more loudly in the Rue Balande; they would have come and opened the door. I\u0027m not saying this because I don\u0027t want my dear child to be here; I am glad to think, on the contrary, that she will, at any rate, die among her own people, and will have only loving faces about her.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Macquart seemed greatly surprised at this speech, and interrupted her by saying with an uneasy manner: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I thought that you and Abbé Faujas were the best of friends.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 319] \\n\\n \\n\\n She made no reply, but stepped up to Marthe, whose breathing was now becoming more difficult. When she left the bedside again, she saw Macquart pulling one of the curtains aside and peering out into the dark night, while rubbing the moist window-pane with his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t go away to-morrow without coming and talking to me,\u0027 she said to him. \u0027I want to have all this cleared up.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Just as you like,\u0027 he replied. \u0027You are very difficult to please. First you like people, and then you don\u0027t like them. I always keep on in the same regular easy-going way.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He was evidently very much vexed to find that the Rougons no longer made common cause with Abbé Faujas. He tapped the window with the tips of his fingers, and still kept his eyes on the black night. Just at that moment the sky was reddened by a sudden glow. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What is that?\u0027 asked Félicité. \\n\\n \\n\\n Macquart opened the window and looked out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It looks like a fire,\u0027 he said unconcernedly. \u0027There is something burning behind the Sub-Prefecture.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There were sounds of commotion on the Place. A servant came into the room with a scared look and told them that the house of madame\u0027s daughter was on fire. It was believed, he continued, that madame\u0027s son-in-law, he whom they had been obliged to shut up, had been seen walking about the garden carrying a burning vine-branch. The most unfortunate part of the matter was that there seemed no hope of saving the lodgers. Félicité turned sharply round, and pondered for a minute, keeping her eyes fixed on Macquart. Then she clearly understood everything. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You promised me solemnly,\u0027 she said in a low voice, \u0027that you would conduct yourself quietly and decently when we set you up in your little house at Les Tulettes. You have everything that you want, and are quite independent. This is abominable, disgraceful, I tell you! How much did Abbé Fenil give you to let Fran?ois escape?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Macquart was going to break out angrily, but Madame Rougon made him keep silent. She seemed much more uneasy about the consequences of the matter than indignant at the crime itself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And what a terrible scandal there will be, if it all comes out,\u0027 she continued. \u0027Have we ever refused you anything? We will talk together to-morrow, and we will speak again of that cornfield about which you are so bitter against us. If[Pg 320] Rougon were to hear of such a thing as this, he would die of grief.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Macquart could not help smiling. Still he defended himself energetically, and swore that he knew nothing about the matter, and had had no hand in it. Then, as the sky grew redder, and Doctor Porquier had already gone downstairs he left the room, saying, as if he were anxiously curious about the matter: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am going to see what is happening.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n It was Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies who had given the alarm. There had been an evening party at the Sub-Prefecture, and he was just going to bed at a few minutes before one o\u0027clock when he perceived a strange red reflection upon the ceiling of his bedroom. Going to the window, he was struck with astonishment at seeing a great fire burning in the Mourets\u0027 garden, while a shadowy form, which he did not at first recognise, danced about in the midst of the smoke, brandishing a blazing vine-branch. Almost immediately afterwards flames burst out from all the openings on the ground-floor. The sub-prefect hurriedly put on his trousers again, called his valet, and sent the porter off to summon the fire-brigade and the authorities. Then, before going to the scene of the disaster, he finished dressing himself and consulted his mirror to make sure that his moustache was quite as it should be. He was the first to arrive in the Rue Balande. The street was absolutely deserted, save for a couple of cats which were rushing across it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They will let themselves be broiled like cutlets in there!\u0027 thought Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, astonished at the quiet, sleepy appearance of the house on the street side, where as yet there was no sign of the conflagration. \\n\\n \\n\\n He knocked loudly at the door, but could hear nothing except the roaring of the fire in the well of the staircase. Then he knocked at Monsieur Rastoil\u0027s door. There piercing screams were heard, hurried rustlings to and fro, banging of doors and stifled calls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Aurélie, cover up your shoulders!\u0027 cried the presiding judge, who rushed out on to the pathway, followed by Madame Rastoil and her younger daughter, the one who was still unmarried. In her hurry, Aurélie had thrown over her shoulders a cloak of her father\u0027s, which left her arms bare. She turned very red as she caught sight of Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 321] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What a terrible disaster!\u0027 stammered the presiding judge. \u0027Everything will be burnt down. The wall of my bedroom is quite hot already. The two houses almost join. Ah! my dear sub-prefect, I haven\u0027t even stopped to remove the time-pieces. We must organise assistance. We can\u0027t stand by and let all our belongings be destroyed in an hour or two.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Madame Rastoil, scantily clothed in a dressing-gown, was bewailing her drawing-room furniture, which she had only just had newly covered. By this time, however, several neighbours had appeared at their windows. The presiding judge summoned them to his assistance, and commenced to remove his effects from his house. He made the time-pieces his own particular charge, and brought them out and deposited them on the pathway opposite. When the easy-chairs from the drawing-room were carried out, he made his wife and daughter sit down in them, and the sub-prefect remained by their side to reassure them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Make yourselves easy, ladies,\u0027 he said. \u0027The engine will be here directly, and then a vigorous attack will be made upon the fire. I think I may undertake to promise that your house will be saved.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n All at once the window-panes of the Mourets\u0027 house burst, and the flames broke out from the first floor. The street was illumined by a bright glow; it was as light as at midday. A drummer could be heard passing across the Place of the Sub-Prefecture, some distance off, sounding the alarm. A number of men ran up, and a chain was formed to pass on the buckets of water; but there were no buckets; and still the engine did not arrive. In the midst of the general consternation Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, without leaving the two ladies, shouted out orders in a loud voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Leave a free passage! The chain is too closely formed down there! Keep yourselves two feet apart!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he turned to Aurélie and said in a low voice: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am very much surprised that the engine has not arrived yet. It is a new engine. This will be the first time it has been used. I sent the porter off immediately, and I told him also to call at the police-station.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n However, the gendarmes arrived before the end. They kept back the inquisitive spectators, whose numbers increased, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The sub-prefect himself went to put the chain in a better order, as it was bulging out in the middle, through the pushing of some rough fellows who[Pg 322] had run up from the outskirts of the town. The little bell of Saint-Saturnin\u0027s was sounding the alarm with cracked notes, and a second drum beat faintly at the bottom of the street near the Mall. At last the engine arrived with a noisy clatter. The crowd made way for it, and the fifteen panting firemen of Plassans came up at a run. However, in spite of Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies\u0027s intervention, a quarter of an hour elapsed before the engine was in working order. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I tell you that it is the piston that won\u0027t work!\u0027 cried the captain angrily to the sub-prefect, who asserted that the nuts were too tightly screwed. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last a jet of water shot up, and the crowd gave a sigh of satisfaction. The house was now blazing from the ground-floor to the second-floor like a huge torch. The water hissed as it fell into the burning mass, and the flames, separating into yellow tongues, seemed to shoot up still higher than before. Some of the firemen had mounted on to the roof of the presiding judge\u0027s house, and were breaking open the tiles with their picks to limit the progress of the fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all up with the place!\u0027 muttered Macquart, who stood quietly on the pathway with his hands in his pockets, watching the conflagration with lively interest. \\n\\n \\n\\n Out in the street a perfect open-air drawing-room had now been established. The easy-chairs were arranged in a semicircle, as though to allow their occupants to view the spectacle at their ease. Madame de Condamin and her husband had just arrived. They had scarcely got back home from the Sub-Prefecture, they said, when they had heard the drum beating the alarm. Monsieur de Bourdeu, Monsieur Maffre, Doctor Porquier, and Monsieur Delangre, accompanied by several members of the municipal council, had also lost no time in hastening to the scene. They all clustered round poor Madame Rastoil and her daughter, trying to comfort and console them with sympathetic remarks. After a time most of them sat down in the easy-chairs, and a general conversation took place, while the engine snorted away half a score yards off and the blazing beams crackled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Have you got my watch, my dear?\u0027 Madame Rastoil inquired. \u0027It was on the mantelpiece with the chain.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes, I have it in my pocket,\u0027 replied the president, trembling with emotion. \u0027I have got the silver as well. I wanted to bring everything away, but the firemen wouldn\u0027t let me; they said it was ridiculous.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 323] \\n\\n \\n\\n Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies still showed the greatest calmness and kindly attention. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I assure you that your house is in no danger at all,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027The force of the fire is spent now. You may go and put your silver back in your dining-room.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n But Monsieur Rastoil would not consent to part with his plate, which he was carrying under his arm, wrapped up in a newspaper. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027All the doors are open,\u0027 he stammered, \u0027and the house is full of people that I know nothing about. They have made a hole in my roof that will cost me a pretty penny to put right again.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Madame de Condamin now questioned the sub-prefect. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh! how terrible!\u0027 she cried. \u0027I thought that the lodgers had had time to escape. Has nothing been seen of Abbé Faujas?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I knocked at the door myself,\u0027 said Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, \u0027but I couldn\u0027t make anyone hear. When the firemen arrived I had the door broken open, and I ordered them to place the ladders against the windows. But nothing was of any use. One of our brave gendarmes who ventured into the hall narrowly escaped being suffocated by the smoke.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027As Abbé Faujas has been, I suppose! What a horrible death!\u0027 said the fair Octavie, with a shudder. \\n\\n \\n\\n The ladies and gentlemen looked into one another\u0027s faces, which showed pale in the flickering light of the conflagration. Doctor Porquier explained to them, however, that death by fire was probably not so painful as they imagined. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027When the fire once reaches one,\u0027 he said in conclusion, \u0027it can only be a matter of few seconds. Of course, it depends, to some extent, upon the violence of the conflagration.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Monsieur de Condamin was counting upon his fingers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Even if Madame Mouret is with her parents, as is asserted, that still leaves four—Abbé Faujas, his mother, his sister, and his brother-in-law. It\u0027s a pretty bad business!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then Madame Rastoil inclined her head towards her husband\u0027s ear. \u0027Give me my watch,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027I don\u0027t feel easy about it. You are always fidgetting, and you may sit on it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Someone now called out that the wind was carrying the sparks towards the Sub-Prefecture, and Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies immediately sprang up, and, apologising for his departure, hastened off to guard against this new danger.[Pg 324] Monsieur Delangre was anxious that a last attempt should be made to rescue the victims. But the captain of the fire brigade roughly told him to go up the ladder himself if he thought such a thing possible; he had never seen such a fire before, he declared. The devil himself must have lighted it, for the house was burning like a bundle of chips, at all points at once. The mayor, followed by some kindly disposed persons, then went round into the Impasse des Chevillottes. Perhaps, he said, it would be possible to get to the windows from the garden side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It would be very magnificent if it were not so sad,\u0027 remarked Madame de Condamin, who was now calmer. \\n\\n \\n\\n The fire was certainly becoming a superb spectacle. Showers of sparks rushed up in the midst of huge blue flames; chasms of glowing red showed themselves behind each of the gaping windows, while the smoke rolled gently away in a huge purplish cloud, like the smoke from Bengal lights set burning at some display of fireworks. The ladies and gentlemen were comfortably seated in their chairs, leaning on their elbows and stretching out their legs as they watched the spectacle before them; and whenever there was a more violent burst of flames than usual, there came an interval of silence, broken by exclamations. At some distance off, in the midst of the flickering brilliance which every now and then lighted up masses of serried heads, there rose the murmur of the crowd, the sound of gushing water, a general confused uproar. Ten paces away the engine, with its regular, snorting breath, continued vomiting streams of water from its metal throat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look at the third window on the second floor!\u0027 suddenly cried Monsieur Maffre. \u0027You can see a bed burning quite distinctly on the left hand. It has yellow curtains, and they are blazing like so much paper.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies now returned at a gentle trot to reassure the ladies and gentlemen. It had been a false alarm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The sparks,\u0027 he said, \u0027are certainly being carried by the wind towards the Sub-Prefecture, but they are extinguished in the air before they reach it. There is no further danger. They have got the fire well in hand now.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But is it known how the fire originated?\u0027 asked Madame de Condamin. \\n\\n \\n\\n Monsieur de Bourdeu asserted that he had first of all seen[Pg 325] a dense smoke issuing from the kitchen. Monsieur Maffre alleged, on the other hand, that the flames had first appeared in a room on the first floor. But the sub-prefect shook his head with an air of official prudence, and said in a low voice: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am much afraid that malice has had something to do with the disaster. I have ordered an inquiry to be made.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he went on to tell them that he had seen a man lighting the fire with a vine-branch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, I saw him too,\u0027 interrupted Aurélie Rastoil. \u0027It was Monsieur Mouret.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n This statement created the greatest astonishment. The thing seemed impossible. Monsieur Mouret escaping and burning down his house—what a frightful story! They overwhelmed Aurélie with questions. She blushed, and her mother looked at her severely. It was scarcely proper for a young girl to be constantly looking out of her window at night-time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I assure you that I distinctly recognised Monsieur Mouret,\u0027 she continued. \u0027I had not gone to sleep, and I got up when I saw a bright light. Monsieur Mouret was dancing about in the midst of the fire.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the sub-prefect spoke out: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mademoiselle is quite correct. I recognise the unhappy man now. He looked so terrible that I was in doubt as to who it might be, although his face seemed familiar. Excuse me; this is a very serious matter, and I must go and give some orders.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He went away again, while the company began to discuss this terrible affair of a landlord burning his lodgers to death. Monsieur de Bourdeu inveighed hotly against lunatic asylums. The surveillance exercised in them, he said, was most imperfect. The truth was that Monsieur de Bourdeu was greatly afraid lest the prefecture which Abbé Faujas had promised him should be burnt away in the fire before his eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Maniacs are extremely revengeful,\u0027 said Monsieur de Condamin, in all simplicity. \\n\\n \\n\\n This remark seemed to embarrass everyone, and the conversation dropped. The ladies shuddered slightly, while the men exchanged peculiar glances. The burning house had become an object of still greater interest now that they knew whose hand had set it on fire. They blinked with a thrill of delicious terror as they gazed upon the glowing pile, and thought of the drama that had been enacted there. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If old Mouret is in there, that makes five,\u0027 said Monsieur[Pg 326] de Condamin. Then the ladies hushed him and told him that he was a cold-blooded, unfeeling man. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Paloques, meanwhile, had been watching the fire since its commencement from the window of their dining-room. They were just above the drawing-room that had been improvised upon the pathway. The judge\u0027s wife at last went out, and graciously offered shelter and hospitality to the Rastoil ladies and the friends surrounding them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We can see very well from our windows, I assure you,\u0027 she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n And, as the ladies declined her invitation, she added: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You will certainly take cold; it is a very sharp night.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n But Madame de Condamin smiled and stretched out her little feet, which showed from beneath her skirts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh dear no! we\u0027re not at all cold,\u0027 she said. \u0027My feet are quite toasted. I am very comfortable indeed. Are you cold, mademoiselle?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am really too warm,\u0027 Aurélie replied. \u0027One could imagine that it was a summer night. This fire keeps one quite warm and cosy.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone declared that it was very pleasant, and so Madame Paloque determined to remain there with them and to take a seat in one of the easy-chairs. Monsieur Maffre had just gone off. He had caught sight, in the midst of the crowd, of his two sons, accompanied by Guillaume Porquier, who had all three run up from a house near the ramparts to see the fire. The magistrate, who was certain that he had locked his lads up in their bedroom, dragged Alphonse and Ambroise away by the ears. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I think we might go off to bed now,\u0027 said Monsieur de Bourdeu, who was gradually growing more cross-grained. \\n\\n \\n\\n However, Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies had reappeared again, and showed himself quite indefatigable, though he never neglected the ladies, in spite of the duties and anxieties of all kinds with which he was overwhelmed. He sprang hastily forward to meet Monsieur Delangre, who was just coming back from the Impasse des Chevillottes. They talked together in low tones. The mayor had apparently witnessed some terrible sight, for he kept passing his hand over his face, as though trying to drive away some awful vision that was pursuing him. The ladies could only hear him murmuring, \u0027We arrived too late! It was horrible!\u0027 He would not answer any questions. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 327] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Only Bourdeu and Delangre will regret Abbé Faujas,\u0027 Monsieur de Condamin whispered in Madame Paloque\u0027s ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They had business on hand with him,\u0027 the latter replied quietly. \u0027Ah! here is Abbé Bourrette. He is weeping from genuine sorrow.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Abbé Bourrette, who had formed part of the chain of men who passed the buckets on, was sobbing bitterly. The poor man refused all consolation. He would not sit down, but remained standing, with anxious, troubled eyes, watching the last beams burn away. Abbé Surin had also been seen; but he had disappeared after picking up in the crowd all the information he could. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Come along; let us be off to bed,\u0027 exclaimed Monsieur de Bourdeu. \u0027It is foolish of us to stop here.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The whole party rose. It was settled that Monsieur Rastoil and his wife and daughter should spend the night at the Paloques\u0027. Madame de Condamin gently tapped her dress, which had got slightly creased, in order to straighten it. The easy-chairs were pushed out of the way, and the company lingered yet a few more moments while bidding each other good-night. The engine was still snorting, and the fire was dying down amidst dense black smoke. Nothing was to be heard but the tramping of the diminishing crowd and the last blows of a fireman\u0027s axe striking down a beam. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is all over!\u0027 thought Macquart, who still kept his position on the opposite pathway. \\n\\n \\n\\n He remained there a few moments longer, listening to the last words which Monsieur de Condamin exchanged in low tones with Madame Paloque. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Bah!\u0027 said the judge\u0027s wife, \u0027no one will cry for him, unless it\u0027s that big gander Bourrette. He had grown quite unendurable, and we were nothing but his slaves. His lordship the Bishop, I dare say, has got a smiling face just now. Plassans is at last delivered!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And the Rougons!\u0027 exclaimed Monsieur de Condamin. \u0027They must be quite delighted.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I should think so, indeed. The Rougons must be up in the heavens. They will inherit the Abbé\u0027s conquest. Ah! they would have paid anyone well who would have run the risk of setting the house on fire.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Macquart went away feeling extremely dissatisfied. He was beginning to fear that he had been duped. The joy of the Rougons filled him with consternation. The Rougons[Pg 328] were crafty folks who always played a double game, and whose opponents were quite certain to end by getting the worst of the struggle. As Macquart crossed the Place of the Sub-Prefecture he swore to himself that he would never set to work in this blind way again. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he went up to the room where Marthe lay dying he found Rose sitting on one of the stairs. She was in a fuming rage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No, indeed, I will certainly not stop in the room!\u0027 she cried. \u0027I won\u0027t look on and see such things. Let her die without me; let her die like a dog! I no longer have any love for her; I have no love for anyone. To send for the poor little fellow to kill him! And I consented to go for him! I shall hate myself for it all my life! He was as white as his nightshirt, the angel! I was obliged to carry him here from the Seminary. I thought he was going to give up the ghost on the way, he cried so. Oh! it\u0027s a cruel shame! And there he has gone into the room now to kiss her! It quite makes my flesh creep. I wish the whole house would topple down on our heads and finish us all off at one stroke! I will shut myself up in some hole somewhere, and live quite alone, and never see anyone again—never, never! One\u0027s whole life seems made up of things that make one weep and make one angry!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Macquart entered the room. Madame Rougon was on her knees, burying her face in her hands, and Serge, with tears streaming down his cheeks, was standing by the bedside supporting the head of the dying woman. She had not yet regained consciousness. The last flickering flames of the conflagration cast a ruddy reflection upon the ceiling of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last a convulsive tremor shook Marthe\u0027s body. She opened her eyes with an expression of surprise, and sat up in bed to glance around her. Then she clasped her hands together with a look of unutterable terror, and died even as she caught sight of Serge\u0027s cassock in the crimson glow. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE END. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049/58421.html","bookId":575,"book":{"id":575,"title":"The Conquest of Plassans 征服祭司","description":"简介： With the end of the century there has come in France a great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the Third Republ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/09-24-16-53-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2049","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
