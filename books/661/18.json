{"id":44303,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"Young George paid his respects to his grandfather the following morning, having been occupied with various affairs and engagements on Sunday until after the Major\u0027s bedtime; and topics concerned with building or excavations were not introduced into the conversation, which was a cheerful one until George lightly mentioned some new plans of his. He was a skillful driver, as the Major knew, and he spoke of his desire to extend his proficiency in this art: in fact, be entertained the ambition to drive a four-in-hand. However, as the Major said nothing, and merely sat still, looking surprised, George went on to say that he did not propose to \"go in for coaching just at the start\"; he thought it would be better to begin with a tandem. He was sure Pendennis could be trained to work as a leader; and all that one needed to buy at present, he said, would be \"comparatively inexpensive—a new trap, and the harness, of course, and a good bay to match Pendennis.\" He did not care for a special groom; one of the stablemen would do. At this point the Major decided to speak. \"You say one of the stablemen would do?\" he inquired, his widened eyes remaining fixed upon his grandson. \"That\u0027s lucky, because one\u0027s all there is, just at present, George. Old fat Tom does it all. Didn\u0027t you notice, when you took Pendennis out, yesterday?\" \"Oh, that will be all right, sir. My mother can lend me her man.\" \"Can she?\" The old gentleman smiled faintly. \"I wonder—\" He paused. \"What, sir?\" \"Whether you mightn\u0027t care to go to law-school somewhere perhaps. I\u0027d be glad to set aside a sum that would see you through.\" This senile divergence from the topic in hand surprised George painfully. \"I have no interest whatever in the law,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t care for it, and the idea of being a professional man has never appealed to me. None of the family has ever gone in for that sort of thing, to my knowledge, and I don\u0027t care to be the first. I was speaking of driving a tandem—\" \"I know you were,\" the Major said quietly. George looked hurt. \"I beg your pardon. Of course if the idea doesn\u0027t appeal to you—\" And he rose to go. The Major ran a tremulous hand through his hair, sighing deeply. \"I— I don\u0027t like to refuse you anything, Georgie,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know that I often have refused you whatever you wanted—in reason—\" \"You\u0027ve always been more than generous, sir,\" George interrupted quickly. \"And if the idea of a tandem doesn\u0027t appeal to you, why—of course—\" And he waved his hand, heroically dismissing the tandem. The Major\u0027s distress became obvious. \"Georgie, I\u0027d like to, but—but I\u0027ve an idea tandems are dangerous to drive, and your mother might be anxious. She—\" \"No, sir; I think not. She felt it would be rather a good thing—help to keep me out in the open air. But if perhaps your finances—\" \"Oh, it isn\u0027t that so much,\" the old gentleman said hurriedly. \"I wasn\u0027t thinking of that altogether.\" He laughed uncomfortably. \"I guess we could still afford a new horse or two, if need be—\" \"I thought you said—\" The Major waved his hand airily. \"Oh, a few retrenchments where things were useless; nothing gained by a raft of idle darkies in the stable—nor by a lot of extra land that might as well be put to work for us in rentals. And if you want this thing so very much—\" \"It\u0027s not important enough to bother about, really, of course.\" \"Well, let\u0027s wait till autumn then,\" said the Major in a tone of relief. \"We\u0027ll see about it in the autumn, if you\u0027re still in the mind for it then. That will be a great deal better. You remind me of it, along in September—or October. We\u0027ll see what can be done.\" He rubbed his hands cheerfully. \"We\u0027ll see what can be done about it then, Georgie. We\u0027ll see.\" And George, in reporting this conversation to his mother, was ruefully humorous. \"In fact, the old boy cheered up so much,\" he told her, \"you\u0027d have thought he\u0027d got a real load off his mind. He seemed to think he\u0027d fixed me up perfectly, and that I was just as good as driving a tandem around his library right that minute! Of course I know he\u0027s anything but miserly; still I can\u0027t help thinking he must be salting a lot of money away. I know prices are higher than they used to be, but he doesn\u0027t spend within thousands of what he used to, and we certainly can\u0027t be spending more than we always have spent. Where does it all go to? Uncle George told me grandfather had sold some pieces of property, and it looks a little queer. If he\u0027s really \u0027property poor,\u0027 of course we ought to be more saving than we are, and help him out. I don\u0027t mind giving up a tandem if it seems a little too expensive just now. I\u0027m perfectly willing to live quietly till he gets his bank balance where he wants it. But I have a faint suspicion, not that he\u0027s getting miserly—not that at all—but that old age has begun to make him timid about money. There\u0027s no doubt about it, he\u0027s getting a little queer: he can\u0027t keep his mind on a subject long. Right in the middle of talking about one thing he\u0027ll wander off to something else; and I shouldn\u0027t be surprised if he turned out to be a lot better off than any of us guess. It\u0027s entirely possible that whatever he\u0027s sold just went into government bonds, or even his safety deposit box. There was a friend of mine in college had an old uncle like that: made the whole family think he was poor as dirt—and then left seven millions. People get terribly queer as they get old, sometimes, and grandfather certainly doesn\u0027t act the way he used to. He seems to be a totally different man. For instance, he said he thought tandem driving might be dangerous—\" \"Did he?\" Isabel asked quickly. \"Then I\u0027m glad he doesn\u0027t want you to have one. I didn\u0027t dream—\" \"But it\u0027s not. There isn\u0027t the slightest—\" Isabel had a bright idea. \"Georgie! Instead of a tandem wouldn\u0027t it interest you to get one of Eugene\u0027s automobiles?\" \"I don\u0027t think so. They\u0027re fast enough, of course. In fact, running one of those things is getting to be quite on the cards for sport, and people go all over the country in \u0027em. But they\u0027re dirty things, and they keep getting out of order, so that you\u0027re always lying down on your back in the mud, and—\" \"Oh, no,\" she interrupted eagerly. \"Haven\u0027t you noticed? You don\u0027t see nearly so many people doing that nowadays as you did two or three years ago, and, when you do, Eugene says it\u0027s apt to be one of the older patterns. The way they make them now, you can get at most of the machinery from the top. I do think you\u0027d be interested, dear.\" George remained indifferent. \"Possibly—but I hardly think so. I know a lot of good people are really taking them up, but still—\" \"But still\u0027 what?\" she said as he paused. \"But still—well, I suppose I\u0027m a little old-fashioned and fastidious, but I\u0027m afraid being a sort of engine driver never will appeal to me, mother. It\u0027s exciting, and I\u0027d like that part of it, but still it doesn\u0027t seem to me precisely the thing a gentleman ought to do. Too much overalls and monkey-wrenches and grease!\" \"But Eugene says people are hiring mechanics to do all that sort of thing for them. They\u0027re beginning to have them just the way they have coachmen; and he says it\u0027s developing into quite a profession.\" \"I know that, mother, of course; but I\u0027ve seen some of these mechanics, and they\u0027re not very satisfactory. For one thing, most of them only pretend to understand the machinery and they let people break down a hundred miles from nowhere, so that about all these fellows are good for is to hunt up a farmer and hire a horse to pull the automobile. And friends of mine at college that\u0027ve had a good deal of experience tell me the mechanics who do understand the engines have no training at all as servants. They\u0027re awful! They say anything they like, and usually speak to members of the family as \u0027Say!\u0027 No, I believe I\u0027d rather wait for September and a tandem, mother.\" Nevertheless, George sometimes consented to sit in an automobile, while waiting for September, and he frequently went driving in one of Eugene\u0027s cars with Lucy and her father. He even allowed himself to be escorted with his mother and Fanny through the growing factory, which was now, as the foreman of the paint shop informed the visitors, \"turning out a car and a quarter a day.\" George had seldom been more excessively bored, but his mother showed a lively interest in everything, wishing to have all the machinery explained to her. It was Lucy who did most of the explaining, while her father looked on and laughed at the mistakes she made, and Fanny remained in the background with George, exhibiting a bleakness that overmatched his boredom. From the factory Eugene took them to lunch at a new restaurant, just opened in the town, a place which surprised Isabel with its metropolitan air, and, though George made fun of it to her, in a whisper, she offered everything the tribute of pleased exclamations; and her gayety helped Eugene\u0027s to make the little occasion almost a festive one. George\u0027s ennui disappeared in spite of himself, and he laughed to see his mother in such spirits. \"I didn\u0027t know mineral waters could go to a person\u0027s head,\" he said. \"Or perhaps it\u0027s this place. It might pay to have a new restaurant opened somewhere in town every time you get the blues.\" Fanny turned to him with a wan smile. \"Oh, she doesn\u0027t \u0027get the blues,\u0027 George!\" Then she added, as if fearing her remark might be thought unpleasantly significant, \"I never knew a person of a more even disposition. I wish I could be like that!\" And though the tone of this afterthought was not so enthusiastic as she tried to make it, she succeeded in producing a fairly amiable effect. \"No,\" Isabel said, reverting to George\u0027s remark, and overlooking Fanny\u0027s. \"What makes me laugh so much at nothing is Eugene\u0027s factory. Wouldn\u0027t anybody be delighted to see an old friend take an idea out of the air like that—an idea that most people laughed at him for— wouldn\u0027t any old friend of his be happy to see how he\u0027d made his idea into such a splendid, humming thing as that factory—all shiny steel, clicking and buzzing away, and with all those workmen, such muscled looking men and yet so intelligent looking?\" \"Hear! Hear!\" George applauded. \"We seem to have a lady orator among us. I hope the waiters won\u0027t mind.\" Isabel laughed, not discouraged. \"It\u0027s beautiful to see such a thing,\" she said. \"It makes us all happy, dear old Eugene!\" And with a brave gesture she stretched out her hand to him across the small table. He took it quickly, giving her a look in which his laughter tried to remain, but vanished before a gratitude threatening to become emotional in spite of him. Isabel, however, turned instantly to Fanny. \"Give him your hand, Fanny,\" she said gayly; and, as Fanny mechanically obeyed, \"There!\" Isabel cried. \"If brother George were here, Eugene would have his three oldest and best friends congratulating him all at once. We know what brother George thinks about it, though. It\u0027s just beautiful, Eugene!\" Probably if her brother George had been with them at the little table, he would have made known what he thought about herself, for it must inevitably have struck him that she was in the midst of one of those \"times\" when she looked \"exactly fourteen years old.\" Lucy served as a proxy for Amberson, perhaps, when she leaned toward George and whispered: \"Did you ever see anything so lovely?\" \"As what?\" George inquired, not because he misunderstood, but because he wished to prolong the pleasant neighbourliness of whispering. \"As your mother! Think of her doing that! She\u0027s a darling! And papa\"—here she imperfectly repressed a tendency to laugh—\"papa looks as if he were either going to explode or utter loud sobs!\" Eugene commanded his features, however, and they resumed their customary apprehensiveness. \"I used to write verse,\" he said—\"if you remember—\" \"Yes,\" Isabel interrupted gently. \"I remember.\" \"I don\u0027t recall that I\u0027ve written any for twenty years or so,\" he continued. \"But I\u0027m almost thinking I could do it again, to thank you for making a factory visit into such a kind celebration.\" \"Gracious!\" Lucy whispered, giggling. \"Aren\u0027t they sentimental\" \"People that age always are,\" George returned. \"They get sentimental over anything at all. Factories or restaurants, it doesn\u0027t matter what!\" And both of them were seized with fits of laughter which they managed to cover under the general movement of departure, as Isabel had risen to go. Outside, upon the crowded street, George helped Lucy into his runabout, and drove off, waving triumphantly, and laughing at Eugene who was struggling with the engine of his car, in the tonneau of which Isabel and Fanny had established themselves. \"Looks like a hand-organ man grinding away for pennies,\" said George, as the runabout turned the corner and into National Avenue. \"I\u0027ll still take a horse, any day.\" He was not so cocksure, half an hour later, on an open road, when a siren whistle wailed behind him, and before the sound had died away, Eugene\u0027s car, coming from behind with what seemed fairly like one long leap, went by the runabout and dwindled almost instantaneously in perspective, with a lace handkerchief in a black-gloved hand fluttering sweet derision as it was swept onward into minuteness—a mere white speck—and then out of sight. George was undoubtedly impressed. \"Your Father does know how to drive some,\" the dashing exhibition forced him to admit. \"Of course Pendennis isn\u0027t as young as he was, and I don\u0027t care to push him too hard. I wouldn\u0027t mind handling one of those machines on the road like that, myself, if that was all there was to it—no cranking to do, or fooling with the engine. Well, I enjoyed part of that lunch quite a lot, Lucy.\" \"The salad?\" \"No. Your whispering to me.\" \"Blarney!\" George made no response, but checked Pendennis to a walk. Whereupon Lucy protested quickly: \"Oh, don\u0027t!\" \"Why? Do you want him to trot his legs off?\" \"No, but—\" \"No, but\u0027—what?\" She spoke with apparent gravity: \"I know when you make him walk it\u0027s so you can give all your attention to—to proposing to me again!\" And as she turned a face of exaggerated color to him, \"By the Lord, but you\u0027re a little witch!\" George cried. \"George, do let Pendennis trot again!\" \"I won\u0027t!\" She clucked to the horse. \"Get up, Pendennis! Trot! Go on! Commence!\" Pendennis paid no attention; she meant nothing to him, and George laughed at her fondly. \"You are the prettiest thing in this world, Lucy!\" he exclaimed. \"When I see you in winter, in furs, with your cheeks red, I think you\u0027re prettiest then, but when I see you in summer, in a straw hat and a shirtwaist and a duck skirt and white gloves and those little silver buckled slippers, and your rose-coloured parasol, and your cheeks not red but with a kind of pinky glow about them, then I see I must have been wrong about the winter! When are you going to drop the \u0027almost\u0027 and say we\u0027re really engaged?\" \"Oh, not for years! So there\u0027s the answer, and Let\u0027s trot again.\" But George was persistent; moreover, he had become serious during the last minute or two. \"I want to know,\" he said. \"I really mean it.\" \"Let\u0027s don\u0027t be serious, George,\" she begged him hopefully. \"Let\u0027s talk of something pleasant.\" He was a little offended. \"Then it isn\u0027t pleasant for you to know that I want to marry you?\" At this she became as serious as he could have asked; she looked down, and her lip quivered like that of a child about to cry. Suddenly she put her hand upon one of his for just an instant, and then withdrew it. \"Lucy!\" he said huskily. \"Dear, what\u0027s the matter? You look as if you were going to cry. You always do that,\" he went on plaintively, \"whenever I can get you to talk about marrying me.\" \"I know it,\" she murmured. \"Well, why do you?\" Her eyelids flickered, and then she looked up at him with a sad gravity, tears seeming just at the poise. \"One reason\u0027s because I have a feeling that it\u0027s never going to be.\" \"Why?\" \"It\u0027s just a feeling.\" \"You haven\u0027t any reason or—\" \"It\u0027s just a feeling.\" \"Well, if that\u0027s all,\" George said, reassured, and laughing confidently, \"I guess I won\u0027t be very much troubled!\" But at once he became serious again, adopting the tone of argument. \"Lucy, how is anything ever going to get a chance to come of it, so long as you keep sticking to \u0027almost\u0027? Doesn\u0027t it strike you as unreasonable to have a \u0027feeling\u0027 that we\u0027ll never be married, when what principally stands between us is the fact that you won\u0027t be really engaged to me? That does seem pretty absurd! Don\u0027t you care enough about me to marry me?\" She looked down again, pathetically troubled. \"Yes.\" \"Won\u0027t you always care that much about me?\" \"I\u0027m—yes—I\u0027m afraid so, George. I never do change much about anything.\" \"Well, then, why in the world won\u0027t you drop the \u0027almost\u0027?\" Her distress increased. \"Everything is—everything—\" \"What about \u0027everything\u0027?\" \"Everything is so—so unsettled.\" And at that he uttered an exclamation of impatience. \"If you aren\u0027t the queerest girl! What is \u0027unsettled\u0027?\" \"Well, for one thing,\" she said, able to smile at his vehemence, \"you haven\u0027t settled on anything to do. At least, if you have you\u0027ve never spoken of it.\" As she spoke, she gave him the quickest possible side glance of hopeful scrutiny; then looked away, not happily. Surprise and displeasure were intentionally visible upon the countenance of her companion; and he permitted a significant period of silence to elapse before making any response. \"Lucy,\" he said, finally, with cold dignity, \"I should like to ask you a few questions.\" \"Yes?\" \"The first is: Haven\u0027t you perfectly well understood that I don\u0027t mean to go into business or adopt a profession?\" \"I wasn\u0027t quite sure,\" she said gently. \"I really didn\u0027t know— quite.\" \"Then of course it\u0027s time I did tell you. I never have been able to see any occasion for a man\u0027s going into trade, or being a lawyer, or any of those things if his position and family were such that he didn\u0027t need to. You know, yourself, there are a lot of people in the East—in the South, too, for that matter—that don\u0027t think we\u0027ve got any particular family or position or culture in this part of the country. I\u0027ve met plenty of that kind of provincial snobs myself, and they\u0027re pretty galling. There were one or two men in my crowd at college, their families had lived on their income for three generations, and they never dreamed there was anybody in their class out here. I had to show them a thing or two, right at the start, and I guess they won\u0027t forget it! Well, I think it\u0027s time all their sort found out that three generations can mean just as much out here as anywhere else. That\u0027s the way I feel about it, and let me tell you I feel it pretty deeply!\" \"But what are you going to do, George?\" she cried. George\u0027s earnestness surpassed hers; he had become flushed and his breathing was emotional. As he confessed, with simple genuineness, he did feel what he was saying \"pretty deeply\"; and in truth his state approached the tremulous. \"I expect to live an honourable life,\" he said. \"I expect to contribute my share to charities, and to take part in—in movements.\" \"What kind?\" \"Whatever appeals to me,\" he said. Lucy looked at him with grieved wonder. \"But you really don\u0027t mean to have any regular business or profession at all?\" \"I certainly do not!\" George returned promptly and emphatically. \"I was afraid so,\" she said in a low voice. George continued to breathe deeply throughout another protracted interval of silence. Then he said, \"I should like to revert to the questions I was asking you, if you don\u0027t mind.\" \"No, George. I think we\u0027d better—\" \"Your father is a business man—\" \"He\u0027s a mechanical genius,\" Lucy interrupted quickly. \"Of course he\u0027s both. And he was a lawyer once—he\u0027s done all sorts of things.\" \"Very well. I merely wished to ask if it\u0027s his influence that makes you think I ought to \u0027do\u0027 something?\" Lucy frowned slightly. \"Why, I suppose almost everything I think or say must be owing to his influence in one way or another. We haven\u0027t had anybody but each other for so many years, and we always think about alike, so of course—\" \"I see!\" And George\u0027s brow darkened with resentment. \"So that\u0027s it, is it? It\u0027s your father\u0027s idea that I ought to go into business and that you oughtn\u0027t to be engaged to me until I do.\" Lucy gave a start, her denial was so quick. \"No! I\u0027ve never once spoken to him about it. Never!\" George looked at her keenly, and he jumped to a conclusion not far from the truth. \"But you know without talking to him that it\u0027s the way he does feel about it? I see.\" She nodded gravely. \"Yes.\" George\u0027s brow grew darker still. \"Do you think I\u0027d be much of a man,\" he said, slowly, \"if I let any other man dictate to me my own way of life?\" \"George! Who\u0027s \u0027dictating\u0027 your—\" \"It seems to me it amounts to that!\" he returned. \"Oh, no! I only know how papa thinks about things. He\u0027s never, never spoken unkindly, or \u0027dictatingly\u0027 of you.\" She lifted her hand in protest, and her face was so touching in its distress that for the moment George forgot his anger. He seized that small, troubled hand. \"Lucy,\" he said huskily. \"Don\u0027t you know that I love you?\" \"Yes—I do.\" \"Don\u0027t you love me?\" \"Yes—I do.\" \"Then what does it matter what your father thinks about my doing something or not doing anything? He has his way, and I have mine. I don\u0027t believe in the whole world scrubbing dishes and selling potatoes and trying law cases. Why, look at your father\u0027s best friend, my Uncle George Amberson—he\u0027s never done anything in his life, and—\" \"Oh, yes, he has,\" she interrupted. \"He was in politics.\" \"Well, I\u0027m glad he\u0027s out,\" George said. \"Politics is a dirty business for a gentleman, and Uncle George would tell you that himself. Lucy, let\u0027s not talk any more about it. Let me tell mother when I get home that we\u0027re engaged. Won\u0027t you, dear?\" She shook her head. \"Is it because—\" For a fleeting instant she touched to her cheek the hand that held hers. \"No,\" she said, and gave him a sudden little look of renewed gayety. \"Let\u0027s let it stay \u0027almost\u0027.\" \"Because your father—\" \"Oh, because it\u0027s better!\" George\u0027s voice shook. \"Isn\u0027t it your father?\" \"It\u0027s his ideals I\u0027m thinking of—yes.\" George dropped her hand abruptly and anger narrowed his eyes. \"I know what you mean,\" he said. \"I dare say I don\u0027t care for your father\u0027s ideals any more than he does for mine!\" He tightened the reins, Pendennis quickening eagerly to the trot; and when George jumped out of the runabout before Lucy\u0027s gate, and assisted her to descend, the silence in which they parted was the same that had begun when Fendennis began to trot. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2003/57207.html","bookId":661,"book":{"id":661,"title":"伟大的安巴逊 The Magnificent Ambersons","description":"简介： 作为安伯森贵族家庭的独子，在母亲依莎伯放任无度的娇纵下，乔治成为一个骄横跋扈、人见人厌的纨子弟。父亲去世后，乔治发现母亲与自己未来的岳父--鳏夫摩根相爱，这一发现使他发狂。为了破坏这段在他看来无法忍受的恋情，他开始想方设法从中作梗。在乔治的逼迫下，摩根...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/08/09-51-56-80-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2003","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:07 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:07 AM"}}
