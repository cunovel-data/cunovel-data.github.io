{"id":44309,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 23","content":"\"I\u0027ve \u0027done it\u0027?\" George cried. \"What do you mean: I\u0027ve done it? And what have I done?\" Amberson had collapsed into an easy chair beside his dressing-table, the white evening tie he had been about to put on dangling from his hand, which had fallen limply on the arm of the chair. The tie dropped to the floor before he replied; and the hand that had held it was lifted to stroke his graying hair reflectively. \"By Jove!\" he muttered. \"That is too bad!\" George folded his arms bitterly. \"Will you kindly answer my question? What have I done that wasn\u0027t honourable and right? Do you think these riffraff can go about bandying my mother\u0027s name—\" \"They can now,\" said Amberson. \"I don\u0027t know if they could before, but they certainly can now!\" \"What do you mean by that?\" His uncle sighed profoundly, picked up his tie and, preoccupied with despondency, twisted the strip of white lawn till it became unwearable. Meanwhile, he tried to enlighten his nephew. \"Gossip is never fatal, Georgie,\" he said, \"until it is denied. Gossip goes on about every human being alive and about all the dead that are alive enough to be remembered, and yet almost never does any harm until some defender makes a controversy. Gossip\u0027s a nasty thing, but it\u0027s sickly, and if people of good intentions will let it entirely alone, it will die, ninety-nine times out of a hundred.\" \"See here,\" George said: \"I didn\u0027t come to listen to any generalizing dose of philosophy! I ask you—\" \"You asked me what you\u0027ve done, and I\u0027m telling you.\" Amberson gave him a melancholy smile, continuing: \"Suffer me to do it in my own way. Fanny says there\u0027s been talk about your mother, and that Mrs. Johnson does some of it. I don\u0027t know, because naturally nobody would come to me with such stuff or mention it before me; but it\u0027s presumably true— I suppose it is. I\u0027ve seen Fanny with Mrs. Johnson quite a lot; and that old lady is a notorious gossip, and that\u0027s why she ordered you out of her house when you pinned her down that she\u0027d been gossiping. I have a suspicion Mrs. Johnson has been quite a comfort to Fanny in their long talks; but she\u0027ll probably quit speaking to her over this, because Fanny told you. I suppose it\u0027s true that the \u0027whole town,\u0027 a lot of others, that is, do share in the gossip. In this town, naturally, anything about any Amberson has always been a stone dropped into the centre of a pond, and a lie would send the ripples as far as a truth would. I\u0027ve been on a steamer when the story went all over the boat, the second day out,\u0027 that the prettiest girl on board didn\u0027t have any ears; and you can take it as a rule that when a woman\u0027s past thirty-five the prettier her hair is, the more certain you are to meet somebody with reliable information that it\u0027s a wig. You can be sure that for many years there\u0027s been more gossip in this place about the Ambersons than about any other family. I dare say it isn\u0027t so much so now as it used to be, because the town got too big long ago, but it\u0027s the truth that the more prominent you are the more gossip there is about you, and the more people would like to pull you down. Well, they can\u0027t do it as long as you refuse to know what gossip there is about you. But the minute you notice it, it\u0027s got you! I\u0027m not speaking of certain kinds of slander that sometimes people have got to take to the courts; I\u0027m talking of the wretched buzzing the Mrs. John-sons do—the thing you seem to have such a horror of—people \u0027talking\u0027—the kind of thing that has assailed your mother. People who have repeated a slander either get ashamed or forget it, if they\u0027re let alone. Challenge them, and in self-defense they believe everything they\u0027ve said: they\u0027d rather believe you a sinner than believe themselves liars, naturally. Submit to gossip and you kill it; fight it and you make it strong. People will forget almost any slander except one that\u0027s been fought.\" \"Is that all?\" George asked. \"I suppose so,\" his uncle murmured sadly. \"Well, then, may I ask what you\u0027d have done, in my place?\" \"I\u0027m not sure, Georgie. When I was your age I was like you in many ways, especially in not being very cool-headed, so I can\u0027t say. Youth can\u0027t be trusted for much, except asserting itself and fighting and making love.\" \"Indeed!\" George snorted. \"May I ask what you think I ought to have done?\" \"Nothing.\" \"\u0027Nothing?\" George echoed, mocking bitterly \"I suppose you think I mean to let my mother\u0027s good name—\" \"Your mother\u0027s good name!\" Amberson cut him off impatiently. \"Nobody has a good name in a bad mouth. Nobody has a good name in a silly mouth, either. Well, your mother\u0027s name was in some silly mouths, and all you\u0027ve done was to go and have a scene with the worst old woman gossip in the town—a scene that\u0027s going to make her into a partisan against your mother, whereas she was a mere prattler before. Don\u0027t you suppose she\u0027ll be all over town with this to-morrow? To-morrow? Why, she\u0027ll have her telephone going to-night as long as any of her friends are up! People that never heard anything about this are going to bear it all now, with embellishments. And she\u0027ll see to it that everybody who\u0027s hinted anything about poor Isabel will know that you\u0027re on the warpath; and that will put them on the defensive and make them vicious. The story will grow as it spreads and—\" George unfolded his arms to strike his right fist into his left palm. \"But do you suppose I\u0027m going to tolerate such things?\" he shouted. \"What do you suppose I\u0027ll be doing?\" \"Nothing helpful.\" \"Oh, you think so, do you?\" \"You can do absolutely nothing,\" said Amberson. \"Nothing of any use. The more you do the more harm you\u0027ll do.\" \"You\u0027ll see! I\u0027m going to stop this thing if I have to force my way into every house on National Avenue and Amberson Boulevard!\" His uncle laughed rather sourly, but made no other comment. \"Well, what do you propose to do?\" George demanded. \"Do you propose to sit there—\" \"Yes.\" \"—and let this riffraff bandy my mother\u0027s good name back and forth among them? Is that what you propose to do?\" \"It\u0027s all I can do,\" Amberson returned. \"It\u0027s all any of us can do now: just sit still and hope that the thing may die down in time, in spite of your stirring up that awful old woman.\" George drew a long breath, then advanced and stood close before his uncle. \"Didn\u0027t you understand me when I told you that people are saying my mother means to marry this man?\" \"Yes, I understood you.\" \"You say that my going over there has made matters worse,\" George went on. \"How about it if such a—such an unspeakable marriage did take place? Do you think that would make people believe they\u0027d been wrong in saying—you know what they say.\" \"No,\" said Amberson deliberately; \"I don\u0027t believe it would. There\u0027d be more badness in the bad mouths and more silliness in the silly mouths, I dare say. But it wouldn\u0027t hurt Isabel and Eugene, if they never heard of it; and if they did hear of it, then they could take their choice between placating gossip or living for their own happiness. If they have decided to marry—\" George almost staggered. \"Good God!\" he gasped. \"You speak of it calmly!\" Amberson looked up at him inquiringly. \"Why shouldn\u0027t they marry if they want to?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s their own affair.\" \"Why shouldn\u0027t they?\" George echoed. \"Why shouldn\u0027t they?\" \"Yes. Why shouldn\u0027t they? I don\u0027t see anything precisely monstrous about two people getting married when they\u0027re both free and care about each other. What\u0027s the matter with their marrying?\" \"It would be monstrous!\" George shouted. \"Monstrous even if this horrible thing hadn\u0027t happened, but now in the face of this—oh, that you can sit there and even speak of it! Your own sister! O God! Oh—\" He became incoherent, swinging away from Amberson and making for the door, wildly gesturing. \"For heaven\u0027s sake, don\u0027t be so theatrical!\" said his uncle, and then, seeing that George was leaving the room: \"Come back here. You mustn\u0027t speak to your mother of this!\" \"Don\u0027t \u0027tend to,\" George said indistinctly; and he plunged out into the big dimly lit hall. He passed his grandfather\u0027s room on the way to the stairs; and the Major was visible within, his white head brightly illumined by a lamp, as he bent low over a ledger upon his roll-top desk. He did not look up, and his grandson strode by the door, not really conscious of the old figure stooping at its tremulous work with long additions and subtractions that refused to balance as they used to. George went home and got a hat and overcoat without seeing either his mother or Fanny. Then he left word that he would be out for dinner, and hurried away from the house. He walked the dark streets of Amberson Addition for an hour, then went downtown and got coffee at a restaurant. After that he walked through the lighted parts of the town until ten o\u0027clock, when he turned north and came back to the purlieus of the Addition. He strode through the length and breadth of it again, his hat pulled down over his forehead, his overcoat collar turned up behind. He walked fiercely, though his feet ached, but by and by he turned homeward, and, when he reached the Major\u0027s, went in and sat upon the steps of the huge stone veranda in front—an obscure figure in that lonely and repellent place. All lights were out at the Major\u0027s, and finally, after twelve, he saw his mother\u0027s window darken at home. He waited half an hour longer, then crossed the front yards of the new houses and let himself noiselessly in the front door. The light in the hall had been left burning, and another in his own room, as he discovered when he got there. He locked the door quickly and without noise, but his fingers were still upon the key when there was a quick footfall in the hall outside. \"Georgie, dear?\" He went to the other end of the room before replying. \"Yes?\" \"I\u0027d been wondering where you were, dear.\" \"Had you?\" There was a pause; then she said timidly: \"Wherever it was, I hope you had a pleasant evening.\" After a silence, \"Thank you,\" he said, without expression. Another silence followed before she spoke again. \"You wouldn\u0027t care to be kissed good-night, I suppose?\" And with a little flurry of placative laughter, she added: \"At your age, of course!\" \"I\u0027m going to bed, now,\" he said. \"Goodnight.\" Another silence seemed blanker than those which had preceded it, and finally her voice came—it was blank, too. \"Good-night.\" After he was in bed his thoughts became more tumultuous than ever; while among all the inchoate and fragmentary sketches of this dreadful day, now rising before him, the clearest was of his uncle collapsed in a big chair with a white tie dangling from his hand; and one conviction, following upon that picture, became definite in George\u0027s mind: that his Uncle George Amberson was a hopeless dreamer from whom no help need be expected, an amiable imbecile lacking in normal impulses, and wholly useless in a struggle which required honour to be defended by a man of action. Then would return a vision of Mrs. Johnson\u0027s furious round head, set behind her great bosom like the sun far sunk on the horizon of a mountain plateau—and her crackling, asthmatic voice… \"Without sharing in other people\u0027s disposition to put an evil interpretation on what may be nothing more than unfortunate appearances.\" … \"Other people may be less considerate in not confirming their discussion of it, as I have, to charitable views.\" … \"you\u0027ll know something pretty quick! You\u0027ll know you\u0027re out in the street.\" … And then George would get up again—and again—and pace the floor in his bare feet. That was what the tormented young man was doing when daylight came gauntly in at his window—pacing the floor, rubbing his head in his hands, and muttering: \"It can\u0027t be true: this can\u0027t be happening to me!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2003/57213.html","bookId":661,"book":{"id":661,"title":"伟大的安巴逊 The Magnificent Ambersons","description":"简介： 作为安伯森贵族家庭的独子，在母亲依莎伯放任无度的娇纵下，乔治成为一个骄横跋扈、人见人厌的纨子弟。父亲去世后，乔治发现母亲与自己未来的岳父--鳏夫摩根相爱，这一发现使他发狂。为了破坏这段在他看来无法忍受的恋情，他开始想方设法从中作梗。在乔治的逼迫下，摩根...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/08/09-51-56-80-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2003","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:07 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:07 AM"}}
