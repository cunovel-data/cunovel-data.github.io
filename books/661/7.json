{"id":44292,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"Having thus, in a word, revealed his ambition for a career above courts, marts, and polling booths, George breathed more deeply than usual, and, turning his face from the lovely companion whom he had just made his confidant, gazed out at the dancers with an expression in which there was both sternness and a contempt for the squalid lives of the unyachted Midlanders before him. However, among them, he marked his mother; and his sombre grandeur relaxed momentarily; a more genial light came into his eyes. Isabel was dancing with the queer-looking duck; and it was to be noted that the lively gentleman\u0027s gait was more sedate than it had been with Miss Fanny Minafer, but not less dexterous and authoritative. He was talking to Isabel as gaily as he had talked to Miss Fanny, though with less laughter, and Isabel listened and answered eagerly: her colour was high and her eyes had a look of delight. She saw George and the beautiful Lucy on the stairway, and nodded to them. George waved his hand vaguely: he had a momentary return of that inexplicable uneasiness and resentment which had troubled him downstairs. \"How lovely your mother is!\" Lucy said \"I think she is,\" he agreed gently. \"She\u0027s the gracefulest woman in that ballroom. She dances like a girl of sixteen.\" \"Most girls of sixteen,\" said George, \"are bum dancers. Anyhow, I wouldn\u0027t dance with one unless I had to.\" \"Well, you\u0027d better dance with your mother! I never saw anybody lovelier. How wonderfully they dance together!\" \"Who?\" \"Your mother and—and the queer-looking duck,\" said Lucy. \"I\u0027m going to dance with him pretty soon.\" \"I don\u0027t care—so long as you don\u0027t give him one of the numbers that belong to me.\" \"I\u0027ll try to remember,\" she said, and thoughtfully lifted to her face the bouquet of violets and lilies, a gesture which George noted without approval. \"Look here! Who sent you those flowers you keep makin\u0027 such a fuss over?\" \"He did.\" \"Who\u0027s \u0027he\u0027?\" \"The queer-looking duck.\" George feared no such rival; he laughed loudly. \"I s\u0027pose he\u0027s some old widower!\" he said, the object thus described seeming ignominious enough to a person of eighteen, without additional characterization. \"Some old widower!\" Lucy became serious at once. \"Yes, he is a widower,\" she said. \"I ought to have told you before; he\u0027s my father.\" George stopped laughing abruptly. \"Well, that\u0027s a horse on me. If I\u0027d known he was your father, of course I wouldn\u0027t have made fun of him. I\u0027m sorry.\" \"Nobody could make fun of him,\" she said quietly. \"Why couldn\u0027t they?\" \"It wouldn\u0027t make him funny: it would only make themselves silly.\" Upon this, George had a gleam of intelligence. \"Well, I\u0027m not going to make myself silly any more, then; I don\u0027t want to take chances like that with you. But I thought he was the Sharon girls\u0027 uncle. He came with them—\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"I\u0027m always late to everything: I wouldn\u0027t let them wait for me. We\u0027re visiting the Sharons.\" \"About time I knew that! You forget my being so fresh about your father, will you? Of course he\u0027s a distinguished looking man, in a way.\" Lucy was still serious. \"In a way?\u0027\" she repeated. \"You mean, not in your way, don\u0027t you?\" George was perplexed. \"How do you mean: not in my way?\" \"People pretty often say \u0027in a way\u0027 and \u0027rather distinguished looking,\u0027 or \u0027rather\u0027 so-and-so, or \u0027rather\u0027 anything, to show that they\u0027re superior don\u0027t they? In New York last month I overheard a climber sort of woman speaking of me as \u0027little Miss Morgan,\u0027 but she didn\u0027t mean my height; she meant that she was important. Her husband spoke of a friend of mine as \u0027little Mr. Pembroke\u0027 and \u0027little Mr. Pembroke\u0027 is six-feet-three. This husband and wife were really so terribly unimportant that the only way they knew to pretend to be important was calling people \u0027little\u0027 Miss or Mister so-and-so. It\u0027s a kind of snob slang, I think. Of course people don\u0027t always say \u0027rather\u0027 or \u0027in a way\u0027 to be superior.\" \"I should say not! I use both of \u0027em a great deal myself,\" said George. \"One thing I don\u0027t see though: What\u0027s the use of a man being six-feetthree? Men that size can\u0027t handle themselves as well as a man about five-feet-eleven and a half can. Those long, gangling men, they\u0027re nearly always too kind of wormy to be any good in athletics, and they\u0027re so awkward they keep falling over chairs or—\" \"Mr. Pembroke is in the army,\" said Lucy primly. \"He\u0027s extraordinarily graceful.\" \"In the army? Oh, I suppose he\u0027s some old friend of your father\u0027s.\" \"They got on very well,\" she said, \"after I introduced them.\" George was a straightforward soul, at least. \"See here!\" he said. \"Are you engaged to anybody?\" \"No.\" Not wholly mollified, he shrugged his shoulders. \"You seem to know a good many people! Do you live in New York?\" \"No. We don\u0027t live anywhere.\" \"What you mean: you don\u0027t live anywhere?\" \"We\u0027ve lived all over,\" she answered. \"Papa used to live here in this town, but that was before I was born.\" \"What do you keep moving around so for? Is he a promoter?\" \"No. He\u0027s an inventor.\" \"What\u0027s he invented?\" \"Just lately,\" said Lucy, \"he\u0027s been working on a new kind of horseless carriage.\" \"Well, I\u0027m sorry for him,\" George said, in no unkindly spirit. \"Those things are never going to amount to anything. People aren\u0027t going to spend their lives lying on their backs in the road and letting grease drip in their faces. Horseless carriages are pretty much a failure, and your father better not waste his time on \u0027em.\" \"Papa\u0027d be so grateful,\" she returned, \"if he could have your advice.\" Instantly George\u0027s face became flushed. \"I don\u0027t know that I\u0027ve done anything to be insulted for!\" he said. \"I don\u0027t see that what I said was particularly fresh.\" \"No, indeed!\" \"Then what do you—\" She laughed gaily. \"I don\u0027t! And I don\u0027t mind your being such a lofty person at all. I think it\u0027s ever so interesting—but papa\u0027s a great man!\" \"Is he?\" George decided to be good-natured \"Well, let us hope so. I hope so, I\u0027m sure.\" Looking at him keenly, she saw that the magnificent youth was incredibly sincere in this bit of graciousness. He spoke as a tolerant, elderly statesman might speak of a promising young politician; and with her eyes still upon him, Lucy shook her head in gentle wonder. \"I\u0027m just beginning to understand,\" she said. \"Understand what?\" \"What it means to be a real Amberson in this town. Papa told me something about it before we came, but I see he didn\u0027t say half enough!\" George superbly took this all for tribute. \"Did your father say he knew the family before he left here?\" \"Yes. I believe he was particularly a friend of your Uncle George; and he didn\u0027t say so, but I imagine he must have known your mother very well, too. He wasn\u0027t an inventor then; he was a young lawyer. The town was smaller in those days, and I believe he was quite well known.\" \"I dare say. I\u0027ve no doubt the family are all very glad to see him back, especially if they used to have him at the house a good deal, as he told you.\" \"I don\u0027t think he meant to boast of it,\" she said: \"He spoke of it quite calmly.\" George stared at her for a moment in perplexity, then perceiving that her intention was satirical, \"Girls really ought to go to a man\u0027s college,\" he said—\"just a month or two, anyhow; It\u0027d take some of the freshness out of \u0027em!\" \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" she retorted, as her partner for the next dance arrived. \"It would only make them a little politer on the surface— they\u0027d be really just as awful as ever, after you got to know them a few minutes.\" \"What do you mean: \u0027after you got to know them a—\u0027\" She was departing to the dance. \"Janie and Mary Sharon told me all about what sort of a little boy you were,\" she said, over her shoulder. \"You must think it out!\" She took wing away on the breeze of the waltz, and George, having stared gloomily after her for a few moments, postponed filling an engagement, and strolled round the fluctuating outskirts of the dance to where his uncle, George Amberson, stood smilingly watching, under one of the rose-vine arches at the entrance to the room. \"Hello, young namesake,\" said the uncle. \"Why lingers the laggard heel of the dancer? Haven\u0027t you got a partner?\" \"She\u0027s sitting around waiting for me somewhere,\" said George. \"See here: Who is this fellow Morgan that Aunt Fanny Minafer was dancing with a while?\" Amberson laughed. \"He\u0027s a man with a pretty daughter, Georgie. Me-seemed you\u0027ve been spending the evening noticing something of that sort—or do I err?\" \"Never mind! What sort is he?\" \"I think we\u0027ll have to give him a character, Georgie. He\u0027s an old friend; used to practice law here—perhaps he had more debts than cases, but he paid \u0027em all up before he left town. Your question is purely mercenary, I take it: you want to know his true worth before proceeding further with the daughter. I cannot inform you, though I notice signs of considerable prosperity in that becoming dress of hers. However, you never can tell, it is an age when every sacrifice is made for the young, and how your own poor mother managed to provide those genuine pearl studs for you out of her allowance from father, I can\u0027t—\" \"Oh, dry up!\" said the nephew. \"I understand this Morgan—\" \"Mr. Eugene Morgan,\" his uncle suggested. \"Politeness requires that the young should—\" \"I guess the \u0027young\u0027 didn\u0027t know much about politeness in your day,\" George interrupted. \"I understand that Mr. Eugene Morgan used to be a great friend of the family.\" \"Oh, the Minafers?\" the uncle inquired, with apparent innocence. \"No, I seem to recall that he and your father were not—\" \"I mean the Ambersons,\" George said impatiently. \"I understand he was a good deal around the house here.\" \"What is your objection to that, George?\" \"What do you mean: my objection?\" \"You seemed to speak with a certain crossness.\" \"Well,\" said George, \"I meant he seems to feel awfully at home here. The way he was dancing with Aunt Fanny—\" Amberson laughed. \"I\u0027m afraid your Aunt Fanny\u0027s heart was stirred by ancient recollections, Georgie.\" \"You mean she used to be silly about him?\" \"She wasn\u0027t considered singular,\" said the uncle \"He was—he was popular. Could you bear a question?\" \"What do you mean: could I bear—\" \"I only wanted to ask: Do you take this same passionate interest in the parents of every girl you dance with? Perhaps it\u0027s a new fashion we old bachelors ought to take up. Is it the thing this year to—\" \"Oh, go on!\" said George, moving away. \"I only wanted to know—\" He left the sentence unfinished, and crossed the room to where a girl sat waiting for his nobility to find time to fulfil his contract with her for this dance. \"Pardon f\u0027 keep\u0027 wait,\" he muttered, as she rose brightly to meet him; and she seemed pleased that he came at all—but George was used to girls\u0027 looking radiant when he danced with them, and she had little effect upon him. He danced with her perfunctorily, thinking the while of Mr. Eugene Morgan and his daughter. Strangely enough, his thoughts dwelt more upon the father than the daughter, though George could not possibly have given a reason—even to himself—for this disturbing preponderance. By a coincidence, though not an odd one, the thoughts and conversation of Mr. Eugene Morgan at this very time were concerned with George Amberson Minafer, rather casually, it is true. Mr. Morgan had retired to a room set apart for smoking, on the second floor, and had found a grizzled gentleman lounging in solitary possession. \"\u0027Gene Morgan!\" this person exclaimed, rising with great heartiness. \"I\u0027d heard you were in town—I don\u0027t believe you know me!\" \"Yes, I do, Fred Kinney!\" Mr. Morgan returned with equal friendliness. \"Your real face-the one I used to know—it\u0027s just underneath the one you\u0027re masquerading in to-night. You ought to have changed it more if you wanted a disguise.\" \"Twenty years!\" said Mr. Kinney. \"It makes some difference in faces, but more in behaviour!\" \"It does sot\" his friend agreed with explosive emphasis. \"My own behaviour began to be different about that long ago—quite suddenly.\" \"I remember,\" said Mr. Kinney sympathetically. \"Well, life\u0027s odd enough as we look back.\" \"Probably it\u0027s going to be odder still—if we could look forward.\" \"Probably.\" They sat and smoked. \"However,\" Mr. Morgan remarked presently, \"I still dance like an Indian. Don\u0027t you?\" \"No. I leave that to my boy Fred. He does the dancing for the family.\" \"I suppose he\u0027s upstairs hard at it?\" \"No, he\u0027s not here.\" Mr. Kinney glanced toward the open door and lowered his voice. \"He wouldn\u0027t come. It seems that a couple of years or so ago he had a row with young Georgie Minafer. Fred was president of a literary club they had, and he said this young Georgie got himself elected instead, in an overbearing sort of way. Fred\u0027s red-headed, you know—I suppose you remember his mother? You were at the wedding—\" \"I remember the wedding,\" said Mr. Morgan. \"And I remember your bachelor dinner—most of it, that is.\" \"Well, my boy Fred\u0027s as red-headed now,\" Mr. Kinney went on, \"as his mother was then, and he\u0027s very bitter about his row with Georgie Minafer. He says he\u0027d rather burn his foot off than set it inside any Amberson house or any place else where young Georgie is. Fact is, the boy seemed to have so much feeling over it I had my doubts about coming myself, but my wife said it was all nonsense; we mustn\u0027t humour Fred in a grudge over such a little thing, and while she despised that Georgie Minafer, herself, as much as any one else did, she wasn\u0027t going to miss a big Amberson show just on account of a boys\u0027 rumpus, and so on and so on; and so we came.\" \"Do people dislike young Minafer generally?\" \"I don\u0027t know about \u0027generally.\u0027 I guess he gets plenty of toadying; but there\u0027s certainly a lot of people that are glad to express their opinions about him.\" \"What\u0027s the matter with him?\" \"Too much Amberson, I suppose, for one thing. And for another, his mother just fell down and worshipped him from the day he was born That\u0027s what beats me! I don\u0027t have to tell you what Isabel Amberson is, Eugene Morgan. She\u0027s got a touch of the Amberson high stuff about her, but you can\u0027t get anybody that ever knew her to deny that she\u0027s just about the finest woman in the world.\" \"No,\" said Eugene Morgan. \"You can\u0027t get anybody to deny that.\" \"Then I can\u0027t see how she doesn\u0027t see the truth about that boy. He thinks he\u0027s a little tin god on wheels—and honestly, it makes some people weak and sick just to think about him! Yet that high-spirited, intelligent woman, Isabel Amberson, actually sits and worships him! You can hear it in her voice when she speaks to him or speaks of him. You can see it in her eyes when she looks at him. My Lord! What does she see when she looks at him?\" Morgan\u0027s odd expression of genial apprehension deepened whimsically, though it denoted no actual apprehension whatever, and cleared away from his face altogether when he smiled; he became surprisingly winning and persuasive when he smiled. He smiled now, after a moment, at this question of his old friend. \"She sees something that we don\u0027t see,\" he said. \"What does she see?\" \"An angel.\" Kinney laughed aloud. \"Well, if she sees an angel when she looks at Georgie Minafer, she\u0027s a funnier woman than I thought she was!\" \"Perhaps she is,\" said Morgan. \"But that\u0027s what she sees.\" \"My Lord! It\u0027s easy to see you\u0027ve only known him an hour or so. In that time have you looked at Georgie and seen an angel?\" \"No. All I saw was a remarkably good-looking fool-boy with the pride of Satan and a set of nice new drawing-room manners that he probably couldn\u0027t use more than half an hour at a time without busting.\" \"Then what—\" \"Mothers are right,\" said Morgan. \"Do you think this young George is the same sort of creature when he\u0027s with his mother that he is when he\u0027s bulldozing your boy Fred? Mothers see the angel in us because the angel is there. If it\u0027s shown to the mother, the son has got an angel to show, hasn\u0027t he? When a son cuts somebody\u0027s throat the mother only sees it\u0027s possible for a misguided angel to act like a devil—and she\u0027s entirely right about that!\" Kinney laughed, and put his hand on his friend\u0027s shoulder. \"I remember what a fellow you always were to argue,\" he said. \"You mean Georgie Minafer is as much of an angel as any murderer is, and that Georgie\u0027s mother is always right.\" \"I\u0027m afraid she always has been,\" Morgan said lightly. The friendly hand remained upon his shoulder. \"She was wrong once, old fellow. At least, so it seemed to me.\" \"No,\" said Morgan, a little awkwardly. \"No—\" Kinney relieved the slight embarrassment that had come upon both of them: he laughed again. \"Wait till you know young Georgie a little better,\" he said. \"Something tells me you\u0027re going to change your mind about his having an angel to show, if you see anything of him!\" \"You mean beauty\u0027s in the eye of the beholder, and the angel is all in the eye of the mother. If you were a painter, Fred, you\u0027d paint mothers with angels\u0027 eyes holding imps in their laps. Me. I\u0027ll stick to the Old Masters and the cherubs.\" Mr. Kinney looked at him musingly. \"Somebody\u0027s eyes must have been pretty angelic,\" he said, \"if they\u0027ve been persuading you that Georgie Minnafer is a cherub!\" \"They are,\" said Morgan heartily. \"They\u0027re more angelic than ever.\" And as a new flourish of music sounded overhead he threw away his cigarette, and jumped up briskly. \"Good-bye, I\u0027ve got this dance with her.\" \"With whom?\" \"With Isabel!\" The grizzled Mr. Kinney affected to rub his eyes. \"It startles me, your jumping up like that to go and dance with Isabel Amberson! Twenty years seem to have passed—but have they? Tell me, have you danced with poor old Fanny, too, this evening?\" \"Twice!\" \"My Lord!\" Kinney groaned, half in earnest. \"Old times starting all over again! My Lord!\" \"Old times?\" Morgan laughed gaily from the doorway. \"Not a bit! There aren\u0027t any old times. When times are gone they\u0027re not old, they\u0027re dead! There aren\u0027t any times but new times!\" And he vanished in such a manner that he seemed already to have begun dancing. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2003/57196.html","bookId":661,"book":{"id":661,"title":"伟大的安巴逊 The Magnificent Ambersons","description":"简介： 作为安伯森贵族家庭的独子，在母亲依莎伯放任无度的娇纵下，乔治成为一个骄横跋扈、人见人厌的纨子弟。父亲去世后，乔治发现母亲与自己未来的岳父--鳏夫摩根相爱，这一发现使他发狂。为了破坏这段在他看来无法忍受的恋情，他开始想方设法从中作梗。在乔治的逼迫下，摩根...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/08/09-51-56-80-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2003","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:07 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:07 AM"}}
