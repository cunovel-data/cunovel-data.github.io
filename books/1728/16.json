{"id":68781,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"ALVAR Kresh had not been in the middle of a real brawl for longer than he could remember. The blood rushed into his veins, and he felt an eager desire for battle. He launched himself into the fight and then-and then he quite suddenly remembered why he always tried to avoid riot duty back when he was a deputy.\n A stranger\u0027s elbow jammed into his ribs, an anonymous hand clawed at his face, and a disembodied boot crushed down on his toes. All three assaults were completely unintentional. He could not even tell which people, in the press of bodies, were responsible. Therewere no people in the melee, just a random collection of fists and feet, bodies and shouts. One moment, Alvar found himself buried beneath a tangle of Settlers and deputies, and the next he was suspended in midair over a tangle of Ironheads.\n Alvar was overwhelmed. The shouts, the cries, the noise, the shock of feelingpain, were tremendous. Robot-protected Spacers rarely had the chance to feel pain of any sort, and Alvar was amazed at the intensity of the sensation.\n He winced and writhed, every instinct telling him to get free, get away. But both duty and desire fought against those impulses: He had a job to do here, and a few debts to pay as well. Alvar Kresh did not get many chances to bust heads.\n The bodies crushed together, punches flew. At first, the two sides seemed evenly matched, but then the Ironheads began to give way. The Ironheads specialized in hit-and-run attacks on property. Never before had they faced a pitched battle against whatever rowdies the Settlers could field.\n And the Settlers here at the lecture were a pretty rough lot. There were no front-office types here, no executives who stayed clean during a workday. Whoever had picked out the Settler delegation to this lecture had sent the roughnecks.\n The differences in experience and attitude began to show. When an Ironhead punched a Settler, the Settler would stand there and take it. But when a Settler landed one good punch on an Ironhead, the Head would drop to the ground, moaning in pain.\n Obvious when you thought about it. After all, robots had been shielding the Ironheads from even the most trivial pain or trauma all their lives. They weren\u0027t used to it. The Settlers-at leastthese rowdies-were quite willing to take a fair amount of punishment in exchange for beating and humiliating the goons who had raised so much hell so many times in Settlertown.\n But the Heads weren\u0027t in full retreat yet. A few of them were showing guts enough to stay and fight-and that suited Alvar just as much as it did the Settlers. The Heads had caused his department no end of grief over the years. Someone stomped on his foot again, and he cried out.\n Someone yelled back, into his ear, and he turned toward whoever it was. And then, suddenly, there he was, face to angry face with Simcor Beddle, the corpulent leader of the Ironheads.\n Alvar\u0027s blood was up. The last few days had been among the toughest of his life. Even if the Ironheads had been the least of his troubles recently, there were still a few older debts to pay. If he could not get his hands on Anshaw or the Governor or Welton or Caliban, then Simcor Beddle would do nicely.\n He grabbed Beddle by the collar and got the pleasure of seeing the blubbering fool cry out in alarm. Alvar drew back his arm, formed his hand into a fist\n - And suddenly there was a huge metallic-green hand wrapped around his fist, holding him back. Alvar looked up, looked around the auditorium. Someone had had the sense to call in the robots waiting in the lobby. One robot was no good in a riot. A thousand, working together, were unstoppable. The robots were swarming allover the room, pulling the combatants apart, putting themselves between attacker and attacked, a whole army of them determinedly enforcing the First Law.\n Oh, well,Alvar thought as he relaxed his fist and let go of Beddle.At least it was fun while it lasted.\n But it would have been nice if he had gotten to throw at least one punch.\n THEflight from the lecture hall to her home was not a happy one for Fredda. Jomain, her sole human escort on the trip, was less than scintillating company, to put it mildly.\n Still, it could have been worse. The others had all taken their own aircars. Jomaine was bad enough, but compared to the alternative of, say, watching Gubber Anshaw fall to pieces, traveling with Jomaine was an absolute joy.\n Which was not to say she wasenjoying the ride. Sitting in stony silence with an angry colleague while a robot did the flying was not her idea of a good time.\n On the other hand, that did not mean she was glad when Jomaine started talking. After all, she knew what he was going to say.\n \"He knows,\" Jomaine said.\n Fredda shut her eyes and leaned back against the headrest of her chair. For a moment or two, she toyed with the idea of playing dumb, pretending she did not know what he was talking about, but he would not fall for that, and he would not enjoy the charade of being forced to tell her what she already knew. \"Not now, Jomaine. It\u0027s been a hard enough day as it is.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think we have the luxury of deciding when would be a pleasant time to discuss this, Fredda. We are in danger. Both of us. I think it is time we tried to find ways to get back in control of the situation. And I don\u0027t think we can do that if we just pretend the problem isn\u0027t there.\"\n \"All right, then, Jomaine, let\u0027s talk about it. What do you want to say? What, exactly, do you think Kresh knows, and what makes you think he knows it?\"\n \"I think he knows Caliban is a No Law robot. I saw him getting a report. It had to be about Horatio. I could see it in Kresh\u0027s face.\"\n Fredda opened her eyes and looked toward Jomaine. \"What about Horatio? I just heard a scrap or two, nothing solid.\"\n \"No, I suppose you wouldn\u0027t have. We tried to let you keep to yourself today and work on your talk. There were police all over Limbo Depot today. Witnesses saw a big red robot go into the supervisor\u0027s office with Horatio. Five minutes later the red robot goes through the plate glass, down into the tunnels, with the cops in hot pursuit. Then a police roboshrink shows up and takes Horatio away. Then Kresh gets that report during your talk. I think we have to assume that Caliban talked to Horatio, somehow or another revealed his true nature to Horatio, and Horatio brainlocked until the psychologists calmed him down.\"\n Fredda screwed up her face and cursed silently in the darkness before she replied in a voice she kept determinedly even and reasonable. \"Yes, that sounds like a sensible guess,\" she said woodenly. Hells on fire! She did not need this now.\n \"Why the devil didn\u0027t youtell him?\" Jomaine demanded. \"Kresh has not only found out the truth, he has found out we were trying to hide the truth. His knowing about Caliban hurt us badly, but you have done us as much damage by hiding the information.\"\n Fredda struggled to keep her temper. \"I know that,\" she said, her voice short and under tight control. \"I should have called and told the police about Caliban the moment I came to in the hospital. Instead I just crossed my fingers and hoped there wouldn\u0027t be any trouble. Remember, I did not even know he wasmissing at first. And it seemed to me that announcing the New Law robots would cause enough trouble all by itself-and it did, in case you didn\u0027t notice. So I took a chance on keeping quiet-and lost. I must thank you for leaving the decision to me. You could have spoken up, too.\"\n \"That was a purely selfish decision. I didn\u0027t want to be thrown in prison. Not when there were still hopes that there would be no further trouble. But then, the more trouble there was, the more dangerous it would be to confess.\"\n \"And now, I can hardly see how it could get worse,\" Fredda said. She let down her guard a bit and sighed. \"We should have told Kresh about Caliban. But that\u0027s the past. We have to look at the present and the future. What do we do now?\"\n \"Let\u0027s think on that for a moment,\" Jomaine said. \"The police may have theories and reports from specialists, but you and I still are the only ones who know forcertain that Caliban is a No-Law.\"\n \"Gubber has his suspicions,\" Fredda said. \"I\u0027m sure he does. But Gubber is in no state or position to go talking to the Sheriff just now.\"\n \"I agree,\" Jomaine said. \"I\u0027m not worried about him. My point is that no matter what happened between Caliban and Horatio, Kresh can\u0027t becertain that Caliban isn\u0027t just a New Law robot, or even some specialized form of standard Three Law robot. There have been cases where robots have been built unaware that they obeyed the Three Laws, but they obeyed them, anyway. All Kresh could have would be Horatio\u0027 s report-and I doubt that Horatio would be an altogether reliable informant. As I recall you built him with extremely high First Law and Third Law potential, with Second Law reduced somewhat. The idea was to give him the ability to make independent decisions.\"\n \"So what\u0027s your point?\" Fredda asked.\n \"An enhanced First Law robot like him wouldn\u0027t be able to deal with Caliban very well or very long without malfunctioning,\" Jomaine said. \"If Caliban talked to him, and described doing much of anything well outside normal robotic behavior, Horatio would probably suffer severe cognitive dissonance and malfunction.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"You\u0027ve just finished making a long speech where you said we rely too much on robots. We believe in them so much we can\u0027t quite believe they could be built any other way. I think if Kresh is given the choice between believing there could be such a thing as a No Law robot, or believing that a malfunctioning robot was confused, he\u0027ll go with the confused robot.\"\n Fredda shifted in her seat and sighed. It was tempting, sorely tempting, to agree with Jomaine. She had spent her whole life in a culture that believed what it wanted and resolutely ignored the facts. She looked at Jomaine and saw his eager, hopeful expression as he continued to speak, desperately trying to convince himself and Fredda both.\n \"Caliban was meant to live in the laboratory,\" Jomaine said. \"He only has a low-capacity power source, and we never taught him how to recharge it. At best, it will last a day or two longer. Maybe it\u0027s died already. If not, then it will fail soon, and he\u0027ll run out of power. He\u0027ll stop dead. If he\u0027s in hiding when that happens, he\u0027ll just vanish. Maybe he was already on reserves when he went to see Horatio. Maybe he\u0027s already keeled over in some tunnel where no one will look for the next twenty years.\"\n \"And maybe Horatio told him how to plug into a recharge receptacle, or maybe Caliban saw a robot charge up somewhere, or maybe he worked it out for himself. We canhope that he will lose power, but we can\u0027tcount on it.\"\n Fredda hesitated a moment, then spoke again. \"Besides, there\u0027s something you don\u0027t know. The information from Gubber that you \"handed to me in the hospital? It was the full police report. I didn\u0027t tell you about it before now because I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d want to know. They have very strong evidence that arobot committed the attack against me. They weren\u0027t ready to believe that evidence before, but now it will be different. And they know a robot named Caliban was involved in a situation with a bunch of robot-bashing Settlers that ended up burning down a building. And there must be more, besides, things that have happened since then. Kresh is not the sort of man to sit still and wait for things to happen. Even if he can\u0027t quite accept the idea of a No Law robot, by now he has a lot more than Horatio\u0027 s statement to convince him that Caliban is strange and dangerous. I doubt he\u0027 d give up looking even if Caliban loses power and vanishes without a trace.\"\n \"Do you really think Kresh believes Caliban to be dangerous?\" Jomaine Terach asked.\n Fredda Leving felt an ache in the pit of her stomach and a throbbing pain in her head. It was time to speak truths she had not been able to face. \"My point, Jomaine, is that Calibanis dangerous. At least we must work on theassumption that he is. Perhaps hedid attack me. You and I know better than anyone else, there was nothing, literally nothing at all, to stop him. Maybe he intends to track me down and finish me off. Who knows?\n \"Yes, maybe Caliban will simply go into hiding, or vanish into the desert, or malfunction somehow. At first, I was hoping Caliban would allow his power pack to run down, or that he would allow himself to be caught and destroyed before he could get into serious trouble-or reveal his true nature. Those seemed reasonable hopes. After all, he was designed to be a laboratory test robot. We deliberately never programmed him to deal with the outside world. And yet he has survived, somehow, and taught himself enough that he can evade the police.\"\n \"I suppose we can blame Gubber Anshaw for that,\" Jomaine said. \"The whole idea of the gravitonic brain was that it was to be more flexible and adaptive than overly rigid positronic brains.\" Jomaine smiled bleakly, his face dimly visible in the semidarkness of the aircar\u0027s cabin. \"Gubber, it seemed, did his job entirely too well.\"\n \"He\u0027s not the only one, Jomaine.\" Fredda rubbed her forehead wearily. \"You and I did the basal programming on him. We took Gubber\u0027s flexible gravitonic brain and wrote the program that would allow that brain to adapt and grow and learn in our lab tests. It\u0027s just that he stumbled into a slightly larger laboratory than the one we planned.\" She shook her head again. \"But I had no idea his gravitonic brain would be adaptive enough to survive out there,\" she said, speaking not so much to Jomaine as to the dark and open air.\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" Jomaine said. \"You say he\u0027s dangerous, but you sound more like you\u0027re worried about him than frightened of him.\"\n \"Iam worried about him,\" Fredda said. \"I created him, and I\u0027m responsible for him, and I cannot believe he is evil or violent. We didn\u0027t give him Laws that would prevent him from harming people, but we didn\u0027t give him anyreason to hurt people either. Half of what we did on the personality coding was compensation for the absence of the Three Laws, making his mind as stable, as well grounded, as we could. And we did our jobright. I\u0027m certain of that. He\u0027s not a killer.\"\n Jomaine cleared his throat gently. \"That\u0027s all as may be,\" he said. \"But there is another factor. Now that we are at last discussing the situation openly, we need to consider thenature of the experiment we planned to perform with Caliban. No matter what else you say about the stability of his personality, or the flexibility of his mind, he was after all built to run one test, designed to answer one question. And when he walked out of your lab, he was primed and ready for that task. He could not help seeking out the answer. He is in all likelihood unaware of what he is looking for, or even that heis looking. But he will be looking, seeking, burning to discover it, even so.\"\n The aircar eased itself to a halt in midair, then began to sink lower. They had arrived at Jomaine\u0027s house, hard by Leving Labs, close to where it had all begun. The car landed on his roof and the hatch sighed open. The cabin light came gently up. Jomaine stood and reached out to Fredda across the narrow cabin, took her hand and squeezed it. \"There is a great deal you have to think about, Fredda Leving. But no one can protect you anymore. Not now. The stakes are far too high. I think you had best start asking yourself what sort of answer Caliban is likely to come up with.\"\n Fredda nodded. \"I understand,\" she said. \"But remember that you are as deeply involved as I am. I can\u0027t expect you to protect me-but remember, we will sink or swim together.\"\n \"That\u0027s not strictly true, Fredda,\" Jomaine said. His voice was quiet, gentle, with no hint of threat or malice. His tone made it clear that he was setting out facts, not trying to scare her. \"Remember that you, not I, designed the final programming of Caliban \u0027 s brain. I have the documentation to prove it, by the way. Yes, we worked together, and no doubt a court could find me guilty of some lesser charge. But it was your plan, your idea, your experiment. If that brain should prove capable of assault, or murder, the blood will be on your hands, not mine. \"\n With that, he looked into her eyes for the space of a dozen heartbeats, and then turned away. There was nothing left to say.\n Fredda watched Jomaine leave the car, watched the door seal itself, watched the cabin light fade back down to darkness. The aircar lifted itself back up into the sky and she turned her head toward the window. She stared sightlessly out onto the night-shrouded, slow-crumbling glory that was the city of Hades. But then the car swung around, and the Leving Labs building swept across her field of view. Suddenly she saw not nothing, but too much. She saw her own past, her own folly and vaulting ambition, her own foolish confidence. There, in that lab, she had bred this nightmare, raised it on a steady diet of her own disastrous questions.\n It had seemed so simple back then. The first New Law robots had passed their in-house laboratory trials. After rather awkward and fractious negotiations, it had been agreed they would be put to use at Limbo. It was a mere question of manufacturing more robots and getting them ready for shipment. That would require effort and planning, yes, but for all intents and purposes, the New Law project was complete insofar as Fredda was concerned. She had time on her hands, and her mind was suddenly free once again to focus on the big questions. Basic, straightforward questions, obvious follow-ons to the theory and practice of the New Law robots.\n If the New Laws are truly better, more logical, better suited to the present day, then won\u0027t they fit a robot\u0027s needs more fully? That had been the first question. But more questions, questions that now seemed foolish, dangerous, threatening, had followed. Back then they had seemed simple, intriguing, exciting. But now there was a rogue robot on the loose, and a city enough on edge that riots could happen.\n If the New Laws are not best suited to the needs of a robot living in our world, then what Laws would be?What Laws would a robot pick for itself!\n Take a robot with a wholly blank brain, a gravitonic brain, without the Three Laws or the New Laws ingrained into it. Imbue it instead with thecapacity for Laws, theneed for Laws. Give it a blank spot, as it were, in the middle of its programming, a hollow in the middle of where its soul would be if it had a soul. In that place, that blank hollow, give it the need to find rules for existence. Set it out in the lab. Create a series of situations where it will encounter people and other robots, and be forced to deal with them. Treat the robot like a rat in a maze, force it to learn by trial and error.\n It will have the burning need to learn, to see, to experience, to form itself and its view of the universe, to set down its own laws for existence. It will have the need to act properly, but no clear knowledge of what the proper way was.\n But it would learn. It would discover. And, Fredda told herself most confidently, it would end up conferring on itself the three New Laws she had formulated.That would be a proof, a confirmation that all her philosophy, her analysis and theory, was correct.\n The car reached its assigned altitude. The robot pilot swung the aircar around, pointed its nose toward Fredda\u0027 s house, and accelerated. Fredda felt herself pressed back into the cushions. The gentle pressure seemed to force her down far too deep into the seat, as if some greater force were pressing her down. But that was illusion, the power of her own guilty imagination. She thought of the things she had told her audience, the dark secrets of the first days of robotics, untold thousands of years before.\n The myth of Frankenstein rose up in the darkness, a palpable presence that she could all but see and touch. There were things in that myth that she had not told to her audience. The myth revolved about the sin of hubris, and presuming on the power of the gods. The magician in the story reached for powers that could not be his, and, in most versions of the tale, received the fitting punishment of complete destruction at the hands of his creation.\n And Caliban had struck her down in his first moment of awareness, had he not? She had given him that carefully edited datastore, hoping that coloring the facts with her own opinions would help form a link between the two of them, make him more capable of understanding her.\n Had he understood her all too well, even in that first moment? Had he struck her down? Or was it someone else?\n It was impossible for her to know, unless she tracked him down, got to him before Kresh did, somehow, and asked Caliban herself.\n Thatwas a most disconcerting idea. Would it be wise to go out looking for the robot that had seemingly tried to kill her?\n Or was that the only way she could save herself? Find him and establish his innocence? Besides, it was not as if Caliban was the only threat she faced, or that simple physical attack was the only way to destroy a person.\n The whole situation was spiraling out of control. It would not need to go much further in order to destroy her reputation altogether. Perhaps it was too late already. If her reputation collapsed, she would not be able to protect the New Law robots for the Limbo Project. There was a great deal of infighting left to do before the NLs would be safe. Rebuilding Limbo would require robot labor; there simply weren\u0027t enough skilled people, Spacer or Settler, available to do the work. But Tonya Welton had made it clear that it was New Law robots or nothing for Limbo. Without the New Law robots, the Settlers would pullout; the project would die.\n And so would the planet.\n Was it sheer egotism, hubris on a new, wider, madder plane, to imagine herself as that important? To think that without her there to protect the New Law robots, theplanet would collapse?\n Her emotions told her that must be so, that one person could not be that important. But reason and logic, her judgment of the political situation, told her otherwise. It was like the game she had played as a child, setting up a whole line of rectangular game pieces balanced on their ends. Knock one down, and the next would fall, and the next and the next.\n And she could hardly save the New Law robot project from inside a prison cell.\n There were other versions of the old Frankenstein myth that she had found in her researches. Rarer, and somehow feeling less authentic, but there just the same. Versions where the magician redeemed himself, made up for his sins against the gods, by protecting his creation, saving it from the fear-crazed peasants that were trying to destroy it.\n She had choices here, and they seemed to be crystallizing with disturbing clarity. She could find Caliban, take the risk that he had done no harm and that she could prove it, and thus redeem herself and save Limbo. It was a risky plan, full of big holes and unsubstantiated hopes.\n The only alternative was to wait around to be destroyed, either by Caliban or by Kresh or sheer political chaos, with the real possibility that her doom spelled that of her world as well.\n She straightened her back and dug her fingers deeper into the armrests of her chair. Her way was clear now.\n Strange,she thought.I\u0027ve reached a decision, and I didn\u0027t even know I was trying to decide anything.\n ALVAR Kresh lay down gratefully, painfully, in his own bed. It had been another incredibly long and frustrating night. After the robots had quelled the riot, and he had revived Donald, there had been the whole weary task of cleaning up after a riot. The night had been given over to handling arrests, tending to the injured, evaluating property damage, collecting statements from witnesses.\n It was not until after it was all done and he was sitting in his aircar, allowing Donald to fly him home, that he even found the time to think over the things Fredda Leving had said. No, more than think; he had brooded, lost himself in a brown study, all the way home, scarcely aware that he had gotten home and into bed.\n But once in bed, with nothing to stare at but the darkness, he was forced to admit it to himself: The damnable woman was right, at least in part.\n Put to one side the utter madness of building a No Law robot. His whole department was already at work, doing all they could, to track down Caliban and destroy him. That was a separate issue.\n But Fredda Levingwas right to say Spacers let their robots do too much. Alvar blinked and looked around himself in the darkness. It suddenly dawned on him that he had gotten into bed without any awareness of his actions. Somehow he had been gotten into the house, changed out of his clothes, washed, and put into bed without being aware of it. He considered for a moment and realized that Donald had done it all.\n The unnoticed minutes snapped back into his recollection. Ofcourse Donald had done it, guiding Alvar through each step, cuing him with hand signals and gentle touches to sit here, lift his left foot, then his right foot, to have his shoes and pants removed. Donald had led him into the refresher, adjusted the water stream for him, guided him into it, and washed his body for him. Donald had dried him, dressed him in pajamas, and gotten him into bed.\n Alvar himself, his own mind and spirit, might as well not have been there for the operation. Donald had been the guiding force, and Alvar the mindless automaton. Worrying over Fredda Leving\u0027s warning that the people of Inferno were letting their robots do too much for them, Alvar Kresh had not even been aware of how completely his robot was not merely caring for him, butcontrolling him.\n Alvar suddenly remembered something, a moment out of his past, back when he had been a patrol officer, sent on one of the most ghastly calls of his entire career. The Davirnik Gidi case. His stomach churned even as he thought of it.\n In all places, in all cultures, there are aspects of human nature that only the police ever see, and even they see only rarely. Places they would just as soon not see at all. Dark, private sides of the human animal that are not crimes, are not illegal, are not, perhaps, evenevil. But they open doors that sane people know should be closed, put on display aspects of humanity that no one would wish to see. Alvar had learned something from Davirnik Gidi. He had learned that madness is troubling, frightening, in direct proportion to the degree to which it shows what is possible, to the degree it shows what a seemingly sane person is capable of doing.\n For if a person as well known, as much admired as Gidi, was capable of such-suchdeviations-then who else might be as well? If Gidi could drop down that deep into something that had no name, then who else might fall? Might not he, Alvar Kresh, fall as well? Might he not already be falling, as sure as Gidi that all he was doing was right and sensible?\n Davirnik Gidi. Burning hells, that had been bad. So bad that he had blocked it almost completely out of his memory, though the nightmares still came now and then. Now he forced himself to think about it.\n Davirnik Gidi was what the Sheriff\u0027s Department primly called an Inert Death, and every deputy knew Inerts were usually bad, but it was universally agreed that Gidi had been the worst. Period. If there was ever a case that warned of something deeply, seriously, wrong, it was Gidi.\n The Inerts were something Spacers did not like to talk about. They did not wish to admit such people existed, at least in part because something that is appalling only becomes more so when it is also dreadfully familiar. Nearly every Spacer could look at an Inert and worry if the sight was something out of a distorted mirror, a twisted nightmare version built out of one\u0027s self.\n Inerts did nothing for themselves. Period. They organized their lives so that their robots could do everything for them. Anything they would have to do for themselves they left undone. They lay on their form-firming couches and let their robots bring their pleasures to them.\n So with Gidi, and that was the frightening thing. Inerts were supposed to be hermits, hiding away from the world, lost in their own private, barricaded worlds, deliberately cutting themselves off from the outside world. But Gidi was a well-known figure in Inferno society, a famous art critic, famous for his monthly parties. They were brilliant affairs that always started at the dot of 2200 and ended on the stroke of 2500. These he attended only by video screen, his wide, fleshy face smiling down from the wall as he chatted with his guests. The camera never pulled away to reveal anything but his face.\n So a young Deputy Kresh learned in the follow-up investigation after his death. He could not have found out firsthand: Sheriff\u0027s deputies simply did not get into events as elegant as Gidi\u0027s parties.\n In Spacer society, a host not attending his own parties was not especially unusual, and so Gidi\u0027s absence was not remarkable.A very private man, people said of Gidi, and that explained and excused all. Spacers had great respect for privacy.\n The only thing that was thought odd was that Gidi never used a holographic projector to place a three-dimensional image of himself in the midst of his parties. Gidi explained holographs made for parlor tricks, and would create an illusion he did not wish to advance-that he himself was truly present. Illusions disconcerted people. They would try to shake the projection\u0027s hand, or pass it a drink, or offer it a seat it did not need. No host wished to upset his guests. It was just that he was in essence a shy man, a retiring man, aprivate man. He was content to stay at home, to enjoy talking with his friends over the screen, to watch them as they had their fun.\n It even started to become fashionable. Other people started making screen appearances at social events. But that fad stopped cold the day Chestrie, Gidi \u0027 s chief household robot, called the Sheriff\u0027s office.\n Kresh and another junior deputy took the call and flew direct to Gidi\u0027s house, a large and grim-faced house on the outskirts of the city, its exterior grounds strangely unkempt and untended. Vines and brambles had grown clear over the walk, and over the front door. Clearly no one had gone in or out of the door in years. Gidi never sent his robots outside to tend the yard-and never went out himself, it seemed.\n The door sensors still worked, though. As soon as the two deputies came close, the door slid open, the mechanism straining a bit against the clinging vines. Chestrie, the chief robot, was there to meet them, clearly agitated. A puff of dust blew out the door, and with it, the smell.\n Flaming devils, thatsmell. The stench of rot, of decayed food, human waste, old sweat and urine hit the deputies hard as a fist, but all of that was as nothing to what lingered beneath-the sweet, putrid, fetid reek of rotting flesh. Even now, thirty years after, the mere memory of that roiling stench was enough to make Kresh feel queasy. At the time it had been bad enough that Kresh\u0027 s partner passed out in the doorway. Chestrie caught him and carried him outside. Even out in the air, the stink seemed to pour out of the house, all but overwhelming. It took Kresh\u0027s partner a minute to recover, and then they went back to the patrol car. They pulled out the riot packs and got the gas masks.\n Then they went in.\n Later, the experts told Kresh that Gidi was a textbook example of the Inertia syndrome. Victims of the syndrome started out normally enough, by Spacer standards. Perhaps a bit on the reclusive side, a bit careful, a bit overdetermined to control their own environment. There was some debate over the triggering mechanism. Some said it was the sheer force of habit, driving the victim\u0027s behavior into more and more rigid channels, until all activity was reduced to ritual. Gidi\u0027s cup of tea at bedtime had to be made precisely the same way every night, or risk throwing the pattern off. Even his monthly parties were ritualized, starting and ending with the precision of a space launch.\n But patternizing was only part of it. Self -enforced seclusion was the other half of the Inertia syndrome, and according to some, the real trigger for it. Some unpleasant disturbance would upset the victim, throw off the ritual, and the victim would decide never to let any such thing happen again. The victim would gradually cut off all ties with the outside world, order his or her robots to refuse all visitors, arrange for all essentials to be delivered-typically, as in Gidi \u0027 s case, by the less obtrusive underground tunnels rather than by surface entrance. As with Gidi, the victim would often literally seal himself off from the outside world, ordering his robots not to open the door to anyone, ever, period.\n The deputies learned a lot from Chestrie and the other robots, and from the copious journals Gidi kept, chronicling his search for what he called \"a comfortable life.\"\n The journals seemed to reveal the moment when the downhill slide began. He attended a party that did not go well, one that ended with an inebriated fellow guest attacking Gidi over some imagined insult.\n The violence stunned him, shocked him. Gidi stopped attending parties, and soon stopped leaving home altogether.\n He could stay where he was, in perfect comfort. With his comm panels and entertainment systems all about him, why would he want to move? With his robots eager and willing to do anything and everything for him, it began to seem foolish, almost criminal, to act for himself when the robots could always do things better and faster, do them with no upset to his routine, his pattern. He could lose himself in his art catalogs, in dictating his articles, in endless fussy arrangements for his monthly parties. In his journals, he described himself as \"a happy man in a perfect world.\"\n At least, all wasnearly perfect. The more peace and quiet he had, the more the remaining disturbances irritated him.\n Anyneedless action, by Gidior by his robots, became unthinkably unpleasant. He began to obsess on simplification as much as regularity, determined to strip away to the essentials, and then strip away whatever he could of the remainder. He set out on a quest to remove all the things that could disturb his quiet, his peace, his solitude, his comfort of being secure in his own place. Banish them, eliminate them, and he could achieve a perfect existence.\n Things started to close in as his obsession gathered strength. Gidi realized he need never leave his comm room, or even get out of his favorite recliner chair. He ordered his robots to bring his food in the chair, wash him in the chair. And then came the moment when, beyond question, even by the standards of the most hermetic Spacer, the scales tipped into madness. Gidi ordered his robots to contact a medical supply service, procure the needed equipment. He replaced his chair with a hospital-type bed with a floater-field, the sort used for burn victims and long-term patients. It would eliminate the danger of bedsores, and it had built-in waste-removal lines, thus removing his last reason for getting up. If the system was not entirely perfect, and there were occasional minor leakages, the robots could take care of it.\n But even perfect indolence was not enough. There was too much activity around him. He soon grew weary of the robots fussing about him, and ordered them to find ways to reduce their level of activity, cutting back on housecleaning, and then finally ceasing it altogether. He ordered them to stop care of the exterior grounds as well, claiming that the mere thought of them scurrying about out there, pruning and cutting and digging, was most upsetting to his calm.\n He decided that his parties had become a bore, and a disruption. He gave them up. Besides, they had forced him to waste too much time on grooming. Once the parties were no more, that problem was eliminated.\n He ordered his own bathing schedule cut back, and then cut back again and again. He had his beard and scalp permanently depilated, so he need never shave or cut his hair again. He had his finger- and toenails treated to prevent them from growing.\n He did not like the robots bringing him meals and then hovering over him, clattering about with the dishes. He ordered his food brought to him in disposable containers and told the robots to leave him the moment he got his food. But there was still the problem of discarding the containers. He could simply drop them on the floor when he was done, but the sight of them bothered him and he would be forced to endure the graver disturbance of a robot coming in to clean them up.\n He discovered that if he flung empty food cartons over his shoulder, they would not be in his line of sight, and thus their presence would not disturb him. But still, thesounds of the robots cleaning was most annoying, and he ordered them to stop.\n The human nose becomes desensitized to a given odor over a period of time, and Gidi was completely unbothered by the filth, the stench, the squalor.\n But even meals themselves became a distraction. Gidi ordered his robots to install drinking and nutrient tubes. Then he had merely to turn his head left or right and suck his food and drink from tubes.\n At last, Gidi had achieved as near to his ideal as could be imagined. Nothing need ever disturb him again. He had reached a state of perfect solitude. He ordered his robots out of his room and told them to stay in their niches until and unless he called for them, and such times became increasingly rare.\n And then they stopped altogether.\n Of course, by the time things reached that state of affairs, Chestrie and the other robots were half -mad, caught in an absolute tangle of First Law conflicts. Gidi, showing a remarkable talent for order-giving, had convinced them that submission to his whims was essential if they were to prevent severe emotional and mental harm to their master. He did it emphatically enough to overcome the robots\u0027 worries over his long-term deterioration.\n That-and the absence of a sense of smell in robots-was why he was able to lie dead far more than long enough to rot. At last, Chestrie\u0027s First Law potential forced him to break Gidi\u0027s command to remain still. He checked on his master and found there was nothing he could do but notify the authorities.\n Kresh and his partner entered a dank and fetid room, the walls covered with some sort of mold. The heap of discarded food containers at the back of the room was quite literally crawling with scavengers. But it was Gidi-or what was left of him-that Kresh still saw sometimes, deep in troubled sleep. That grinning, fly-covered corpse, that corpse with skin thatmoved, writhing and wriggling as the maggots inside fed on their host. The ghastly dribble of fluid that dripped from the foot of the bed, some horrible liquefied by-product of decay. The shriveled eyes, the fleshy parts of the ears and nose that were dried and blackened, starting to resemble bits of leather.\n The coroner never bothered-or perhaps could not bring himself-to do an autopsy or determine the cause of death. He set it down asnatural causes, and everyone was quite content to let it go at that, and never mind what sort of comment on Spacer society it was for such a death to be called natural.\n No one, anywhere, ever, wanted to talk about it. Chestrie and the other robots were quietly destroyed, the house tom down, the grounds abandoned and left to their own devices. No one was even willing to go near the spot anymore. No one would so much as mention Gidi\u0027s name.\n Artists who had built their careers and reputations based on his praise suddenly found themselves not only without a sponsor but in the uncomfortable situation of having the merits of their work certified by a madman, or worse, having the direction of their work influenced by his opinions. No one was willing to deal with them. Some of them dropped out of the art world, while those with a bit more backbone started their careers all over again from scratch, and set about the task of remaking names for themselves without Gidi \u0027 s endorsement and guidance.\n The only other visible effect of his death was that the fad of attending social events via screen and holograph died a sudden and quiet death.\n It was cold comfort to assure oneself that Gidi had gone mad. After all, Gidi had started out sane and never realized he had crossed the line. His continued belief in his own rationality was right there in his journals. He spent much of his last days congratulating himself on the achievement of an orderly and sensible life.\n If madmen did not know when they were crazy, how could anyone ever be sure they were sane? No one in the city of Hades ever looked at the question. No one ever talked about that, or any, aspect of the case.\n But just how healthy was a society when the universal reaction to a horrible, real-life nightmare was to pretend it had never happened?\n And how far was too far to go in letting the robots take care of everything?\n Alvar grunted to himself. Not being aware of what your own body was doing while a robot got you ready for bed was clearly not a good sign.\n \"Donald!\" he called out into the darkness.\n There was a faint noise. It sounded as if Donald, standing in his niche on the opposite side of the room, had stepped forward a pace or two. Kresh could see nothing of him at first, but then the robot powered up his eyes, and Kresh spotted them, two faintly glowing spots of blue in the blackness. \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"Leave me,\" Kresh said. \"Spend the night somewhere else in the house besides my bedroom suite. Do not attend me in any way until I leave my bedroom in the morning. Instruct the rest of the house staff robots to do the same.\"\n \"Yes, sir,\" Donald said, speaking quite calmly and without surprise, just as if their morning routine had not been established decades before.\n Alvar Kresh watched the two glowing eyes move toward the door, heard the door open and close, and heard Donald as he moved out into the hallway.\n How many others?Alvar wondered. How many others of the people in that audience, how many of those who watched at home, were sending their robots away tonight, troubled by what Fredda Leving had said, determined to make a new start at living their own lives, rather than having the robots live them for them?\n None of them? Millions? Somewhere in between? It was disturbing that he had no idea. He liked to think that he knew the people of Hades pretty well. But in this, he had no idea at all. Maybe he was not the only one remembering Davirnik Gidi tonight. And if that ~as so, then Fredda Leving had performed a real service tonight. People needed their eyes opened.\n But then his thoughts turned toward the subject he had been trying not to think about. Caliban, lurking out there in the shadows. Lawless, uncontrolled, his mere existence likely to inspire fear and riot, and perhaps worse,\n Alvar Kresh frowned angrily into the darkness. Maybe Fredda Leving had done some good tonight, but there was no doubt whatsoever that she had also committed a terrible crime.\n And for that, she was going to pay. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/caliban-isaac-asimov-s-caliban-1/page-16.html","bookId":1728,"book":{"id":1728,"title":"Caliban (Isaac Asimov\u0027s Caliban #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Caliban (Isaac Asimov\u0027s Caliban #1) \n In a universe protected by the Three Laws of Robotics, humans are safe.The First Law states, \n A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. \n When an experiment with a new type of robot brain goes awry, the unthinkable happens.
