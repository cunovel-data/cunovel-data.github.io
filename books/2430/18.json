{"id":78151,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\"The earthman is mad,\" cried Leebig, turning to the others. \"Isn\u0027t that obvious?\" Some stared at Leebig wordlessly, some at Baley. Baley gave them no chance to come to decisions. He said, \"You know better, Dr. Leebig. Dr. Delmarre was going to break off with you. Mrs. Delmarre thought it was because you wouldn\u0027t marry. I don\u0027t think so. Dr. Delmarre himself was planning a future in which ectogenesis would be possible and marriage unnecessary. But Dr. Delmarre was working with you; he would know, and guess, more about your work than anyone else. He would know if you were attempting dangerous experiments and he would try to stop you. He hinted about such matters to Agent Gruer, but gave no details, because he was not yet certain of the details. Obviously, you discovered his suspicions and killed him.\" \"Mad!\" said Leebig again. \"I will have nothing more to do with this.\" But Attlebish interrupted. \"Hear him out, Leebig!\" Baley bit his lip to keep from a premature display of satisfaction at the obvious lack of sympathy in the Security Head\u0027s voice. He said, \"In the same discussion with me in which you mentioned robots with detachable limbs, Dr. Leebig, you mentioned spaceships with built-in positronic brains. You were definitely talking too much then. Was it that you thought I was only an Earthman and incapable of understanding the implications of robotics? Or was it that you had just been threatened with personal presence, had the threat lifted, and were a little delirious with relief? In any case, Dr. Quemot had already told me that the secret weapon of Solaria against the Outer Worlds was the positronic robot.\" Quemot, thus unexpectedly referred to, started violently, and cried, \"I meant - \" \"You meant it sociologically, I know. But it gives rise to thoughts. Consider a spaceship with a built-in positronic brain as compared to a manned spaceship. A manned spaceship could not use robots in active warfare. A robot could not destroy humans on enemy spaceships or on enemy worlds. It could not grasp the distinction between friendly humans and enemy humans. \"Of course, a robot could be told that the opposing spaceship had no humans aboard. It could be told that it was an uninhabited planet that was being bombarded. That would be difficult to manage. A robot could see that its own ship carried humans; it would know its own world held humans. It would assume that the same was true of enemy ships and worlds. It would take a real expert in robotics, such as you, Dr. Leebig, to handle them properly in that case, and there are very few suck experts. \"But a spaceship that was equipped with its own positronic brain would cheerfully attack any ship it was directed to attack, it seems to me. It would naturally assume all other ships were unmanned. A positronic-brained ship could easily be made incapable of receiving messages from enemy ships that might undeceive it. With its weapons and defenses under the immediate control of a positronic brain, it would be more maneuverable than any manned ship. With no room necessary for crewmen, for supplies, for water or air purifiers, it could carry more armor, more weapons and be more invulnerable than any ordinary ship. One ship with a positronic brain could defeat fleets of ordinary ships. Am I wrong?\" The last question was shot at Dr. Leebig, who had risen from his seat and was standing, rigid, almost cataleptic with - what? Anger? Horror? There was no answer. No answer could have been heard. Something tore loose and the others were yelling madly. Klorissa had the face of a Fury and even Gladia was on her feet, her small fist beating the air threateningly. And all had turned on Leebig. Baley relaxed and closed his eyes. He tried for just a few moments to unknot his muscles, unfreeze his tendons. It had worked. He had pressed the right button at last. Quemot had made an analogy between the Solarian robots and the Spartan Helots. He said the robots could not revolt so that the Solarians could relax. But what if some human threatened to teach the robots how to harm humans; to make them, in other words, capable of revolting? Would that not be the ultimate crime? On a world such as Solaria would not every last inhabitant turn fiercely against anyone even suspected of making a robot capable of harming a human; on Solaria, where robots outnumbered humans by twenty thousand to one? Attlebish cried, \"You are under arrest. You are absolutely forbidden to touch your books or records until the government has a chance to inspect them - \" He went on, almost incoherent, scarcely heard in the pandemonium. A robot approached Baley. \"A message, master, from the master Olivaw.\" Baley took the message gravely, turned, and cried, \"One moment.\" His voice had an almost magical effect. All turned to look at him solemnly and in no face (outside Leebig\u0027s frozen glare) was there any sign of anything but the most painful attention to the Earthman. Baley said, \"It is foolish to expect Dr. Leebig to leave his records untouched while waiting for some official to reach them. So even before this interview began, my partner, Daneel Olivaw, left for Dr. Leebig\u0027s estate. I have just heard from him. He is on the grounds now and will be with Dr. Leebig in a moment in order that he may be put under restraint.\" \"Restraint!\" howled Leebig in an almost animal terror, His eyes widened into staring holes in his head. \"Someone coming here? Personal presence? No! No!\" The second \"No\" was a shriek. \"You will not be harmed,\" said Baley coldly, \"if you co-operate.\" \"But I won\u0027t see him. I can\u0027t see him.\" The roboticist fell to his knees without seeming aware of the motion. He put his hands together in a desperate clasped gesture of appeal. \"What do you want? Do you want a confession? Delmarre\u0027s robot had detachable limbs. Yes. Yes. Yes. I arranged Gruer\u0027s poisoning. I arranged the arrow meant for you. I even planned the spaceships as you said. I haven\u0027t succeeded, but, yes, I planned it. Only keep the man away. Don\u0027t let him come. Keep him away!\" He was babbling. Baley nodded. Another right button. The threat of personal presence would do more to induce confession than any physical torture. But then, at some noise or movement outside the field of sound or vision of any of the others, Leebig\u0027s head twisted and his mouth opened. He lifted a pair of hands, holding something off. \"Away,\" he begged. \"Go away. Don\u0027t come. Please don\u0027t come. Please - \" He scrambled away on hands and knees, then his hand went suddenly to a pocket in his jacket. It came out with something and moved rapidly to his mouth. Swaying twice, he fell prone. Baley wanted to cry: You fool, it isn\u0027t a human that\u0027s approaching; only one of the robots you love. Daneel Olivaw darted into the field of vision and for a moment stared down at the crumpled figure. Baley held his breath. If Daneel should realize it was his own pseudo humanity that had killed Leebig, the effect on his First Law enslaved brain might be drastic. But Daneel only knelt and his delicate fingers touched Leebig here and there. Then he lifted Leebig\u0027s head as though it were infinitely precious to him, cradling it, caressing it. His beautifully chiseled face stared out at the others and he whispered, \"A human is dead!\" Baley was expecting her; she had asked for a last interview; but his eyes widened when she appeared. He said, \"I\u0027m seeing you.\" \"Yes,\" said Gladia, \"how can you tell?\" \"You\u0027re wearing gloves.\" \"Oh.\" She looked at her hands in confusion. Then, softly, \"Do you mind?\" \"No, of course not. But why have you decided to see, rather than view?\" \"Well\" - she smiled weakly - \"I\u0027ve got to get used to it, don\u0027t I, Elijah? I mean, if I\u0027m going to Aurora.\" \"Then it\u0027s all arranged?\" \"Mr. Olivaw seems to have influence. It\u0027s all arranged. I\u0027ll never come back.\" \"Good. You\u0027ll be happier, Gladia. I know you will.\" \"I\u0027m a little afraid.\" \"I know. It will mean seeing all the time and, you won\u0027t have all the comforts you had on Solaria. But you\u0027ll get used to it and, what\u0027s more, you\u0027ll forget all the terror you\u0027ve been through.\" \"I don\u0027t want to forget everything,\" said Gladia softly. \"You will.\" Baley looked at the slim girl who stood before him and said, not without a momentary pang, \"And you will be married someday, too. Really married, I mean.\" \"Somehow,\" she said mournfully, \"that doesn\u0027t seem so attractive to me - right now.\" \"You\u0027ll change your mind.\" And they stood there, looking at each other for a wordless moment. Gladia said, \"I\u0027ve never thanked you.\" Baley said, \"It was only my job.\" \"You\u0027ll be going back to Earth now, won\u0027t you?\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027ll never see you again.\" \"Probably not. But don\u0027t feel badly about that. In forty years at most, I\u0027ll be dead and you won\u0027t look a bit different from the way you do now.\" Her face twisted. \"Don\u0027t say that.\" \"It\u0027s true.\" She said rapidly, as though forced to change the subject, \"It\u0027s all true about Jothan Leebig, you know.\" \"I know. Other roboticists went over his records and found experiments toward unmanned intelligent spaceships. They also found other robots with replaceable limbs.\" Gladia shuddered, \"Why did he do such a horrible thing, do you suppose?\" \"He was afraid of people. He killed himself to avoid personal presence and he was ready to kill other worlds to make sure that Solaria and its personal - presence taboo would never be touched.\" \"How could he feel so,\" she murmured, \"when personal presence can be so very - \" Again a silent moment while they faced each other at ten paces. Then Gladia cried suddenly, \"Oh, Elijah, you\u0027ll think it abandoned of me.\" \"Think what abandoned?\" \"May I touch you? I\u0027ll never see you again, Elijah.\" \"If you want to.\" Step by step, she came closer, her eyes glowing, yet looking apprehensive, too. She stopped three feet away, then slowly, as though in a trance, she began to remove the glove on her right hand. Baley started a restraining gesture. \"Don\u0027t be foolish, Gladia.\" \"I\u0027m not afraid,\" said Gladia. Her hand was bare. It trembled as she extended it. And so did Baley\u0027s as he took her hand in his. They remained so for one moment, her hand a shy thing, frightened as it rested in his. He opened his hand and hers escaped, darted suddenly and without warning toward his face until her fingertips rested feather-light upon his cheek for the barest moment. She said, \"Thank you, Elijah. Good-by.\" He said, \"Good-by, Gladia,\" and watched her leave. Even the thought that a ship was waiting to take him back to Earth did not wipe out the sense of loss he felt at that moment. Undersecretary Albert Minnim\u0027s look was intended to be one of prim welcome. \"I am glad to see you back on Earth. Your report, of course, arrived before you did and is being studied. You did a good job. The matter will look well in your record.\" \"Thank you,\" said Baley. There was no room for further elation in him. Being back on Earth; being safe in the Caves; being in hearing of Jessie\u0027s voice (he had spoken to her already) had left him strangely empty. \"However,\" said Minnim, \"your report concerned only the murder investigation. There was another matter we were interested in. May I have a report on that, verbally?\" Baley hesitated and his hand moved automatically toward the inner pocket where the warm comfort of his pipe could once more be found. Minnim said at once, \"You may smoke, Baley.\" Baley made of the lighting process a rather drawn-out ritual. He said, \"I am not a sociologist.\" \"Aren\u0027t you?\" Minnim smiled briefly. \"It seems to me we discussed that once. A successful detective must be a good rule-of-thumb sociologist even if he never heard of Hackeu!s Equation. I think, from your discomfort at the moment, that you have notions concerning the Outer Worlds but aren\u0027t sure how it will sound to me?\" \"If you put it that way, sir... When you ordered me to Solaria, you asked a question; you asked what the weaknesses of the Outer Worlds were. Their strengths were their robots, their low population, their long lives, but what were their weaknesses?\" \"Well?\" \"I believe I know the weaknesses of the Solarians, sir.\" \"You can answer my question? Good. Go ahead.\" \"Their weaknesses, sir, are their robots, their low population, their long lives.\" Minnim stared at Baley without any change of expression. His hands worked in jerky finger-drawn designs along the papers on his desk. He said, \"Why do you say that?\" Baley had spent hours organizing his thoughts on the way back from Solaria; had confronted officialdom, in imagination, with balanced, well-reasoned arguments. Now he felt at a loss. He said, \"I\u0027m not sure I can put them clearly.\" \"No matter. Let me hear. This is first approximation only.\" Baley said, \"The Solarians have given up something mankind has had for a million years; something worth more than atomic power, cities, agriculture, tools, fire, everything; because it\u0027s something that made everything else possible.\" \"I don\u0027t want to guess, Baley. What is it?\" \"The tribe, sir. Cooperation between individuals. Solaria has given it\u0027 up entirely. It is a world of isolated individuals and the planet\u0027s only sociologist is delighted that this is so. That sociologist, by the way, never heard of sociomathematics, because he is inventing his own science. There is no one to teach him, no one to help him, no one to think of something he himself might miss. The only science that really flourishes on Solaria is robotics and there are only a handful of men involved in that, and when it came to an analysis of the interaction of robots and men, they had to call in an Earthman to help. \"Solarian art, sir, is abstract. We have abstract art on Earth as one form of art; but on Solaria it is the only form. The human touch is gone. The looked-for future is one of ectogenesis and complete isolation from birth.\" Minnim said, \"It all sounds horrible. But is it harmful?\" \"I think so. Without the interplay of human against human, the chief interest in life is gone; most of the intellectual values are gone; most of the reason for living is gone. Viewing is no substitute for seeing. The Solarians, themselves, are conscious that viewing is a long-distance sense. \"And if isolation isn\u0027t enough to induce stagnation, there is the matter of their long lives. On Earth, we have a continuous influx of young people who are willing to change because they haven\u0027t had time to grow hard-set in their ways. I suppose there\u0027s some optimum. A life long enough for real accomplishment and short enough to make way for youth at a rate that\u0027s not too slow. On Solaria, the rate is too slow.\" Minnim still drew patterns with his finger. \"Interesting! Interesting!\" He looked up, and it was as though a mask had fallen away. There was glee in his eyes. \"Plainclothesman, you\u0027re a man of penetration.\" \"Thank you,\" said Baley stiffly. \"Do you know why I encouraged you to describe your views to me?\" He was almost like a little boy, hugging his pleasure. He went on without waiting for an answer. \"Your report has already undergone preliminary analysis by our sociologists and I was wondering if you had any idea yourself as to the excellent news for Earth you had brought with you. I see you have.\" \"But wait,\" said Baley. \"There\u0027s more to this.\" \"There is, indeed,\" agreed Minnim jubilantly. \"Solaria cannot possibly correct its stagnation. It has passed a critical point and their dependence on robots has gone too far. Individual robots can\u0027t discipline an individual child, even though discipline may do the child eventual good. The robot can\u0027t see past the immediate pain. And robots collectively cannot discipline a planet by allowing its institutions to collapse when the institutions have grown harmful. They can\u0027t see past the immediate chaos. So the only end for the Outer Worlds is perpetual stagnation and Earth will be freed of their domination. This new data changes everything. Physical revolt will not even be necessary. Freedom will come of itself.\" \"Wait,\" said Baley again, more loudly. \"It\u0027s only Solaria we\u0027re discussing, not any other Outer World.\" \"It\u0027s the same thing. Your Solarian sociologist - Kimot - \" \"Quemot, sir.\" \"Quemot, then. He said, did he not, that the other Outer Worlds were moving in the direction of Solaria?\" \"He did, but he knew nothing about the other Outer Worlds firsthand, and he was no sociologist. Not really. I thought I made that clear.\" \"Our own men will check.\" \"They\u0027ll lack data too. We know nothing about the really big Outer Worlds. Aurora, for instance; Daneel\u0027s world. To me, it doesn\u0027t seem reasonable to expect them to be anything like Solaria. In fact, there\u0027s only one world in the Galaxy which resembles Solaria - \" Minnim was dismissing the subject with a small, happy wave of his neat hand. \"Our men will check. I\u0027m sure they will agree with Quemot.\" Baley\u0027s stare grew somber. If Earth\u0027s sociologists were anxious enough for happy news, they would find themselves agreeing with Quemot, at that. Anything could be found in figures if the search were long enough and hard enough and if the proper pieces of information were ignored or overlooked. He hesitated. Was it best now to speak while he had the ear of a man high in the government or - He hesitated a trifle too long. Minnim was speaking again, shuffling a few papers and growing more matter-of-fact. \"A few minor matters, Plainclothesman, concerning the Delmarre case itself and then you will be free to go. Did you intend to have Leebig commit suicide?\" \"I intended to force a confession, sir. I had not anticipated suicide at the approach, ironically, of someone who was only a robot and who would not really be violating the taboo against personal presence. But, frankly, I don\u0027t regret his death. He was a dangerous man. It will be a long time before there will be another man who will combine his sickness and his brilliance.\" \"I agree with that,\" said Minnim dryly, \"and consider his death fortunate, but didn\u0027t you consider your danger if the Solarians had stopped to realize that Leebig couldn\u0027t possibly have murdered Delmarre?\" Baley took his pipe out of his mouth and said nothing. \"Come, Plainclothesman,\" said Minnim. \"You know he didn\u0027t. The murder required personal presence and Leebig would die rather than allow that. He did die rather than allow it.\" Baley said, \"You\u0027re right, sir. I counted on the Solarians being too horrified at his misuse of robots to stop to think of that.\" \"Then who did kill Delmarre?\" Baley said slowly, \"If you mean who struck the actual blow, it was the person everyone knew had done so. Gladia Delmarre, the man\u0027s wife.\" \"And you let her go?\" Baley said, \"Morally, the responsibility wasn\u0027t hers. Leebig knew Gladia quarreled bitterly with her husband, and often. He must have known how furious she could grow in moments of anger. Leebig wanted the death of the husband under circumstances that would incriminate the wife. So he supplied Delmarre with a robot and, I imagine, instructed it with all the skill he possessed to hand Gladia one of its detachable limbs at the moment of her full fury. With a weapon in her hand at the crucial moment, she acted in a temporary black-out before either Delmarre or the robot could stop her. Gladia was as much Leebig\u0027s unwitting instrument as the robot itself.\" Minnim said, \"The robot\u0027s arm must have been smeared with blood and matted hair.\" \"It probably was,\" said Baley, \"but it was Leebig who took the murder robot in charge. He could easily have instructed any other robots who might have noticed the fact to forget it. Dr. Thool might have noticed it, but he inspected only the dead man and the unconscious woman. Leebig\u0027s mistake was to think that guilt would rest so obviously on Gladia that the matter of the absence of an obvious weapon at the scene wouldn\u0027t save her. Nor could he anticipate that an Earthman would be called in to help with the investigation.\" \"So with Leebig dead, you arranged to have Gladia leave Solaria. Was that to save her in case any Solarians began thinking about the case?\" Baley shrugged. \"She had suffered enough. She had been victimized by everyone; by her husband, by Leebig, by the world of Solaria.\" Minnim said, \"Weren\u0027t you bending the law to suit a personal whim?\" Baley\u0027s craggy face grew hard. \"It was not a whim. I was not bound by Solarian law. Earth\u0027s interests were paramount, and for the sake of those interests, I had to see that Leebig, the dangerous one, was dealt with. As for Mrs. Delmarre.\" He faced Minnim now, and felt himself taking a crucial step. He had to say this. \"As for Mrs. Delmarre, I made her the basis of an experiment.\" \"What experiment?\" \"I wanted to know if she would consent to face a world where personal presence was permitted and expected. I was curious to know if she had the courage to face disruption of habits so deeply settled in her. I was afraid she might refuse to go; that she might insist on remaining on Solaria, which was purgatory to her, rather than bring herself to abandon her distorted Solarian way of life. But she chose change and I was glad she did, because to me it seemed symbolic. It seemed to open the gates of salvation for us.\" \"For us?\" said Minnim with energy. \"What the devil do you mean?\" \"Not for you and me, particularly, sir,\" said Baley gravely, \"but for all mankind. You\u0027re wrong about the other Outer Worlds. They have few robots; they permit personal presence; and they have been investigating Solaria. R. Daneel Olivaw was there with me, you know, and he\u0027ll bring back a report. There is a danger they may become Solarias someday, but they will probably recognize that danger and work to keep themselves in a reasonable balance and in that way remain the leaders of mankind.\" \"That is your opinion,\" said Minnim testily. \"And there\u0027s more to it. There is one world like Solaria and that\u0027s Earth.\" \"Plainclothesman Baley!\" \"It\u0027s so, sir. We\u0027re Solaria inside out. They retreated into isolation from one another. We retreated into isolation from the Galaxy. They are at the dead end of their inviolable estates. We are at the dead end of underground Cities. They\u0027re leaders without followers, only robots who can\u0027t talk back. We\u0027re followers without leaders, only enclosing Cities to keep us safe.\" Baley\u0027s fists clenched. Minnim disapproved. \"Plainclothesman, you have been through an ordeal. You need a rest and you will have one. A month\u0027s vacation, full pay, and a promotion at the end of it.\" \"Thank you, but that\u0027s not all I want. I want you to listen. There\u0027s only one direction out of our dead end and that\u0027s outward, toward Space. There are a million worlds out there and the Spacers own only fifty. They are few and long-lived. We are many and short lived. We: are better suited than they for exploration and colonization. We have population pressure to push us and a rapid turnover of generation to keep us supplied with the young and restless. It was our ancestors who colonized the Outer Worlds in the first place.\" \"Yes, I see - but I\u0027m afraid our time is up.\" Baley could feel the other\u0027s anxiety to be rid of him and he remained stolidly in place. He said, \"When the original colonization established worlds superior to our own in technology, we escaped by building wombs beneath the ground for ourselves. The Spacers made us feel inferior and we hid from them. That\u0027s no answer. To avoid the destructive rhythm of rebellion and suppression, we must compete with them, follow them, if we must, lead them, if we can. To do that, we must face the open; we must teach ourselves to face the open. If it is too late to teach ourselves, then we must teach our children. It\u0027s vital!\" \"You need a rest, Plainclothesman.\" Baley said violently, \"Listen to me, sir. If the Spacers are strong and we remain as we are, then Earth will be destroyed within a century. That has been computed, as you yourself told me. If the Spacers are really weak and are growing weaker, then we may escape, but who says the Spacers are weak? The Solarians, yes, but that\u0027s all we know.\" \"But - \" \"I\u0027m not through. One thing we can change, whether the Spacers are weak or strong. We can change the way we are. Let us face the open and we\u0027ll never need rebellion. We can spread out into our own crowd of worlds and become Spacers ourselves. If we stay here on Earth, cooped up, then useless and fatal rebellion can\u0027t be stopped. It will be all the worse if the people build any false hopes because of supposed Spacer weakness. Go ahead, ask the sociologists. Put my argument to them. And if they\u0027re still in doubt, find a way to send me to Aurora. Let me bring back a report on the real Spacers, and you\u0027ll see what Earth must do.\" Minnim nodded. \"Yes, yes. Good day, now, Plainclothesman Baley.\" Baley left with a feeling of exaltation. He had not expected an open victory over Minnim. Victories over ingrained patterns of thought are not won in a day or a year. But he had seen the look of pensive uncertainty that had crossed Minnim\u0027s Lace and had blotted out, at least for a while, the earlier uncritical joy. He felt he could see into the future. Mannikin would ask the sociologists and one or two of them would be uncertain. They would wonder. They would consult Baley. Give it one year, thought Baley, one year, and I\u0027ll be on my way to Aurora. One generation, and we\u0027ll be out in space once more. Baley stepped onto the northbound Expressway. Soon he would see Jessie. Would she understand? And his son, Bentley, now seventeen. When Ben had a seventeen-year-old of his own, would he be standing on some empty world, building a spacious life? It was a frightening thought. Baley still feared the open. But he no longer feared the fear! It was not something to run from, that fear, but something to fight. Baley felt as though a touch of madness had come over him. From the very first the open had had its weird attraction over him; from the time in the ground-car when he had tricked Daneel in order to have the top lowered so that he might stand up in the open air. He had failed to understand then. Daneel thought he was being perverse. Baley himself thought he was facing the open out of professional necessity, to solve a crime. Only on that last evening on Solaria, with the curtain tearing away from the window, did he realize his need to face the open for the open\u0027s own sake; for its attraction and its promise of freedom. There must be millions on Earth who would feel that same urge, if the open were only brought to their attention, if they could be made to take the first step. He looked about. The Expressway was speeding on. All about him was artificial light and huge banks of apartments gliding backward and flashing signs and store windows and factories and lights and noise and crowds and more noise and people and people and people... It was all he had loved, all he had hated and feared to leave, all he had thought he longed for on Solaria. And it was all strange to him. He couldn\u0027t make himself fit back in. He had gone out to solve a murder and something had happened to him. He had told Minnim the Cities were wombs, and so they were. And what was the first thing a man must do before he can be a man? He must be born. He must leave the womb. And once left, it could not be re-entered. Baley had left the City and could not re-enter. The City was no longer his; the Caves of Steel were alien. This had to be. And it would be so for others and Earth would be born again and reach outward. His heart beat madly and the noise of life about him sank to an unheard murmur. He remembered his dream on Solaria and he understood it at last. He lifted his head and he could see through all the steel and concrete and humanity above him. He could see the beacon set in space to lure men outward. He could see it shining down.
