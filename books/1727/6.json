She smelled the vegetation - not quite the odors of Aurora - and at once she crossed the gap of twenty decades.\n Nothing, she knew, could bring back associations in the way that odors could. Not sights, not sounds.\n Just that faint, unique smell brought back childhood, the freedom of running about, with a dozen robots watching her carefully - the excitement of seeing other children sometimes, coming to a halt, staring shyly, approaching one another a half-step at a time, reaching out to touch, and then a robot saying, \"Enough, Miss Gladia,\" and being led away - looking over the shoulder at the other child, with whom there was another set of attendant robots in charge.\n She remembered the day that she was told that only by holovision would she see other human beings thereafter.\n \"Seeing.\" Viewing, she was told - not seeing. The robots said as though it were a word they must not say, so that they had to whisper it. She could see them, but they were not human.\n It was not so bad at first. The images she could talk to were three-dimensional, free-moving. They could talk, run, turn cartwheels if they wished - but they could not be felt. And then she was told that she could actually see someone whom she had often viewed and whom she had liked. He was a grown man, quite a bit older than she was, though he looked quite young, as one did on Solaria. She would have permission to continue to see him - if she wished whenever necessary.\n She wished. She remembered how it was - exactly how it was on that first day. She was tongue-tied and so was he. They circled each other, afraid to touch. - But it was marriage.\n Of course it was. And then they met again - seeing, viewing, because it was marriage. They would finally touch each other. They were supposed to.\n It was the most exciting day of her life - until it took place.\n Fiercely, Gladia stopped her thoughts. Of what use to go on? She so warm and eager; he so cold and withdrawn. He continued to be cold. When he came to see her, at fixed intervals, for the rites that might (or might not) succeed in impregnating her, it was with such clear revulsion that she was soon longing for him to forget. But he was a man duty and he never forgot.\n Then came the time, years of dragging unhappiness later, when she found him dead, his skull crushed, and herself as the only possible suspect. Elijah Baley had saved her then and she had been taken away from Solaria and sent to Aurora.\n Now she was back, smelling Solaria.\n Nothing else was familiar. The house in the distance bore no resemblance to anything she remembered even faintly. In twenty decades it had been modified, torn down, rebuilt. She could not even gain any sense of familiarity with the ground itself.\n She found herself reaching backward to touch the Settler ship that had brought her to this world that smelled like home but was home in no other way - just to touch something that was familiar by comparison.\n Daneel, who stood next to her in the shadow of the ship, said, \"Do you see the robots, Madam Gladia?\"\n There were a group of them, a hundred yards away, amid the trees of an orchard, watching solemnly, motionlessly, shining in the sun with the grayish well-polished metal finish Gladia remembered Solarian robots to have.\n She said, \"I do, Daneel.\"\n \"Is there anything familiar about them, madam?\"\n \"Not at all. They seem to be new models. I can\u0027t remember them and I\u0027m sure they can\u0027t remember me. If D.G. was expecting anything hopeful to come of my supposed familiarity with the robots on my estate, he will have to be disappointed.\"\n Giskard said, \"They do not seem to be doing anything, madam.\"\n Gladia said, \"That is understandable. We\u0027re intruders and they\u0027ve come to observe us and to report on us in accordance with what must be standing orders. They have no one now to report to, however, and can merely silently observe. Without further orders, I presume they will do no more than that, but they won\u0027t cease doing so, either.\"\n Daneel said, \"It might be well, Madam Gladia, if we retired to our quarters on board ship. The captain is, I believe, supervising the construction of defenses and is not ready to go exploring yet. I suspect he will not approve your having left your quarters without his specific permission.\"\n Gladia said haughtily, \"I\u0027m not going to delay stepping out onto the surface of my own world just to suit his whim.\"\n \"I understand, but members of the crew are engaged in the vicinity and I believe that some note your presence here.\"\n \"And are approaching,\" said Giskard. \"If you would avoid infection - \"\n \"I\u0027m prepared,\" said Gladia. \"Nose plugs and gloves.\"\n Gladia did not understand the nature of the structures being put up on the flat ground about the ship. For the most part, the crewmen, absorbed in the construction, had not seen Gladia and her two companions, standing as they were in the shadows. (It was the warm season on this portion of Solaria, which had a tendency to grow warmer - and on other occasions, colder - than Aurora did, since the Solarian day was nearly six hours longer than the Auroran day.)\n The crewmen approaching were five in number and one of them, the tallest and largest, pointed in the direction of Gladia. The other four looked, remained standing for a while as though merely curious, and then, at a gesture from the first, approached again, changing their angle slightly so as to head directly for the Auroran three.\n Gladia watched them silently and with her eyebrows raised in contempt. Daneel and Giskard waited impassively.\n Giskard said in a low voice to Daneel, \"I do not know where the captain is. I cannot distinguish him from the crowd of crewmen in whose midst he must be.\"\n \"Shall we retire?\" said Daneel aloud.\n \"That would be disgraceful,\" said Gladia. \"This is my world.\"\n She held her ground and the five crewmen came closer in leisurely fashion.\n They had been working, doing hard physical labor (Like robots, thought Gladia with distain) and they were sweating. Gladia became aware of the odor that reeked from them. That would have served to force her away more than threats would, but she held her ground even so. The nose plugs, she was sure, mitigated the effect of the smell.\n The large crewman approached more closely than the others. His skin was bronzed. His bare arms glistened with moisture and with shining musculature. He might be thirty (as nearly as Gladia could judge the age of these shortlived beings) and if he were washed and properly dressed, he might prove quite presentable.\n He said, \"So you are the Spacer lady from Aurora that we\u0027ve been carrying on our ship?\" He spoke rather slowly, obviously trying to attain an aristocratic tinge to his Galactic. He failed, of course, and he spoke like a Settler - even more crudely than D.G. did.\n Gladia said, establishing her territorial rights, \"I am from Solaria, Settler,\" and stopped in confused embarrassment. She had spent so much time thinking of Solaria just now that twenty decades had dropped away and she had spoken with a thick Solarian accent. There was the broad \"a\" in Solaria and the rough \"r,\" while the \"i\" sounded horribly like \"Oi\".\n She said again, in a much lower, less commanding voice, but one in which the accent of Aurora University - the standard for Galactic speech through all the Spacer worlds - rang clear, \"I am from Solaria, Settler.\"\n The Settler laughed and turned to the others. \"She speaks la-di-da, but she had to try. Right, mates?\"\n The others laughed, too, and one cried out, \"Get her to talk some more, Niss. Maybe we can a learn to talk like Spacer birdies.\" And he placed one hand on his hip in as dainty a manner as he could manage, while holding the other hand out limply.\n Niss said, still smiling, \"Shut up, all of you.\" There was instant silence.\n He turned to Gladia again, \"I\u0027m Berto Niss, First-Class Shipper. And your name, little woman?\"\n Gladia did not venture to speak again.\n Niss said, \"I\u0027m being polite, little woman. I\u0027m speaking gentlemanly. Spacer-like. I know you\u0027re old enough to be my great-grandmother. How old you are you, little woman?\"\n \"Four hundred,\" shouted one of the crewmen from behind Niss, \"but she doesn\u0027t look it!\"\n \"She doesn\u0027t look one hundred,\" said another.\n \"She looks suitable for a little ding-donging, said a third, \"and hasn\u0027t had any for a long time, I guess. Ask her if she\u0027d want some, Niss. Be polite and ask if we - can take turns.\"\n Gladia flushed angrily and Daneel said, \"First-Class Shipper Niss, your companions are offending Madam Gladia. Would you retire?\"\n Niss turned to look at Daneel, whom, till now, he had totally ignored. The smile vanished from his face and he said, \"Look, you. This little lady is off-limits. The captain said so. We won\u0027t bother her. Just a little harmless talk. That thing there is a robot. We won\u0027t bother with him and he can\u0027t hurt us. We know the Three Laws of Robotics. We order him to stay away from us, see. But you are a Spacer and the captain has give us no orders about you. So you\" - he pointed a finger - \"stay out of this and don\u0027t interfere or you\u0027ll get your pretty skin all bruised up and then you might cry.\"\n Daneel said nothing.\n Niss nodded his head. \"Good. I like to see someone smart enough not to start anything he can\u0027t finish.\"\n He turned to Gladia, \"Now, little Spacer woman, we will leave you alone because the captain doesn\u0027t want you bothered. If one of the men here made a crude remark, that\u0027s only natural. Just shake hands and let\u0027s be friends - Spacer, Settler, what\u0027s the difference?\"\n He thrust out his hand toward Gladia, who shrank away in horror. Daneel\u0027s hand moved outward in a flick that was almost too fast to see and caught Niss\u0027s wrist. \"First-Class Shipper Niss,\" he said quietly, \"do not attempt to touch the lady.\"\n Niss looked down at his hand and at the fingers that enclosed his wrist firmly. He said in a low and menacing growl, \"You have till the count of three to let go.\"\n Daneel\u0027s hand fell away. He said, \"I must do as you say for I do not wish to harm you, but I must protect the lady and if she doesn\u0027t wish to be touched, as I believe she doesn\u0027t, I may be forced into a position where I must cause you pain. Please, accept my assurance that I will do all I can to minimize that.\"\n One of the crewmen shouted joyously, \"Give it to him, Niss. He\u0027s a talker.\"\n Niss said, \"Look, Spacer, twice I told you to keep out and you touched me once. Now I tell you a third time and that\u0027s it. Make a move, say a word, and I take you apart. This little woman is going to shake hands, that\u0027s all, friendly like. Then we all go. Fair enough?\"\n Gladia said in a low choking voice. \"I won\u0027t be touched by him. Do what is necessary.\"\n Daneel said, \"Sir, with all due respect, the lady does not wish to be touched. I must ask you - all of you - to leave.\"\n Niss smiled and one large arm moved as though to brush Daneel to one side - and to do it hard.\n Daneel\u0027s left arm flickered and once again Niss was held by the wrist. \"Please go, sir,\" said Daneel.\n Niss\u0027s teeth continued to show, but he was no longer smiling. Violently, he brought his arm up. Daneel\u0027s enclosing hand moved up for a short distance, slowed, and came to a halt. His face showed no strain. His hand moved down, dragging Niss\u0027s arm with it, and then, with a rapid twist, he bent Niss\u0027s arm behind the Settler\u0027s broad back and held it there.\n Niss, who found himself unexpectedly with his back to Daneel, brought his other arm up over his head, groping for Daneel\u0027s neck. His other wrist was seized and pulled down farther than it could easily go and Niss grunted in clear misery.\n The other four crewmen, who had been watching in eager anticipation, remained in place now, motionless, silent, mouths open.\n Niss, staring at them, grunted, \"Help me!\"\n Daneel said, \"They will not help you, sir, for the captain\u0027s punishment will be all the worse if they try. I must ask you now to assure me that you will no longer trouble Madam Gladia and that you will leave quietly, all of you. Otherwise, I very much regret, First-Class Shipper, that I must pull your arms out of their sockets.\"\n As he said that, he tightened his grip on either wrist and Niss emitted a muffled grunt.\n \"My apologies, sir,\" said Daneel, \"but I am under the strictest orders. May I have your assurance?\"\n Niss kicked backward with sudden viciousness, but well before his - heavy boot could make contact, - Daneel had faded to one side and pulled him off-balance. He went facedown heavily.\n \"May I have your assurance, sir?\" said Daneel, now pulling gently at the two wrists so that the crewman\u0027s arms lifted slightly up from the back.\n Niss howled and said, half-incoherent, \"I give in. Let go.\"\n Daneel let go at once and stepped back. Slowly and painfully, Niss rolled over, moving his arms slowly and rotating his wrists with a twisted grimace.\n Then, when his right arm moved near the holster he wore, he snatched clumsily at his sidearm.\n Daneel\u0027s foot came down on his hand and pinned it to the ground. \"Don\u0027t do that, sir, or I may be forced to break one or more of the small bones in your hand.\" He bent down and extracted Niss\u0027s blaster from its holster. \"Now stand up.\"\n \"Well, Mr. Niss,\" came another voice. \"Do as you are told and stand up.\"\n D.G. Baley was standing at their side, beard bristling, face slightly flushed, but his voice was dangerously calm.\n \"You four,\" he said, \"hand me your sidearms, one at a time. Come on. Move a little faster. One-two-three-four. Now continue to stand there at attention. Sir,\" this to Daneel - \"give me that sidearm you are holding. Good. Five. And now, Mr. Niss, at attention.\" And he placed the blasters on the ground beside him.\n Niss stiffened to attention, eyes bloodshot, face contorted, in obvious pain.\n \"Would someone,\" said D.G., \"please say what has been going on?\"\n \"Captain,\" said Daneel quickly, \"Mr. Niss and I have had a playful altercation. No harm has been done.\"\n \"Mr. Niss, however, looks somewhat harmed,\" said D.G.\n \"No permanent harm, Captain,\" said Daneel.\n \"I see. Well, we\u0027ll get back to this later. - Madam,\" he turned on his heel to address Gladia - \"I don\u0027t recall that I gave you permission to emerge from the ship. You will go back to your cabin with your two companions at once. I am captain here and this is not Aurora. Do as I say!\"\n Daneel placed an apologetic hand on Gladia\u0027s elbow. Her chin lifted, but she, turned and went up the gangplank and into the ship, Daneel at her side, Giskard following.\n D.G. then turned to the crewmen. \"You five,\" he said, his voice never lifting from its flat calm, \"come with me. We\u0027ll get to the bottom of this - or of you.\" And he gestured to a petty officer to pick up the sidearms and take them away.\n 25\n D.G. stared at the five grimly. He was in his own quarters, the only portion of the ship that had a semblance of size to it and the beginnings of an appearance of luxury.\n He said, pointing to each in turn, \"Now, this is the way we\u0027ll work it. You tell me exactly what happened, word for word, motion for motion. When you\u0027re finished, you tell me anything that was wrong or left out. Then you the same, and then you, and then I\u0027ll get to you, Niss. I expect that you were all out of order, that you all did something unusually stupid that earned you all, but especially Niss, considerable humiliation. If, in your story, it would appear that you did nothing wrong and suffered no humiliation, then I\u0027ll know you\u0027re lying, especially as the Spacer woman will surely tell me what happened and I intend to believe every word she says. A lie will make matters worse for you than anything you\u0027ve actually done. Now,\" he barked, \"start!\"\n The first crewman stumbled hastily through the story, and then the second, somewhat correcting, somewhat expanding, then the third and the fourth. D.G. listened, stony faced, to the recital, then motioned Berto Niss to one side.\n He spoke to the other four, \"And while Niss was getting his face rightly mashed into the dirt by the Spacer, what were you four doing? Watching? Scared to move? All four of you? Against one man?\"\n One of the men broke the thickening silence to say, \"It all happened so quick, Captain. We we\u0027re just getting set to move in and then it was all over.\"\n \"And what were you getting ready to do in case you did manage to get to move someday?\"\n \"Well, we were going to pull the Spacer foreigner off our mate.\"\n \"Do you think you could have?\"\n This time no one offered to make a sound.\n D.G. leaned toward them. \"Now, here\u0027s the situation. You had no business with the foreigners, so you\u0027re fined one week\u0027s pay each. And now - let\u0027s get something straight. If you tell what has happened to anyone else - in the crew or out, now or ever, whether drunk or sober, you\u0027ll be broken, every one of you, to apprentice shipper. It doesn\u0027t matter which one of you talks, you\u0027ll all four be broken, so keep an eye on each other. Now get to your assigned tasks and if you cross me at any time during this voyage, if you as much as hiccup against regulations, you\u0027ll be in the brig.\"\n The four left, mournful, hangdog, tight-lipped. Niss remained, a bruise developing on his face, his arms clearly in discomfort.\n D.G. regarded him with a threatening quiet, while Niss stared to the left, to the right, at his feet, everywhere but at the face of the captain. It was only when Niss\u0027s eyes, running out of evasion, caught the glare of the captain, that D.G. said, \"Well, you look very handsome, now that you have tangled with a sissy Spacer half your size. Next time you better hide when one of them shows up - \"\n \"Yes, Captain,\" said Niss miserably.\n \"Did you or did you not, Niss, hear me in my briefing, before we left Aurora, say that the Spacer woman and her companions were on no account to be disturbed or spoken to?\"\n \"Captain, I wanted only a polite howdy do. We was curious for a closer look. No harm meant.\"\n \"You meant no harm? You I asked how old she was. Was that your business?\"\n \"Just curious. Wanted to know.\"\n \"One of you made a sexual suggestion.\"\n \"Not me, Captain.\"\n \"Someone else? Did you apologize - for it?\"\n \"To a Spacer?\" Niss sounded horrified.\n \"Certainly. You were going against my orders.\"\n \"I meant no harm,\" said Niss doggedly.\n \"You meant no harm to the man?\"\n \"He put his hand on me, Captain.\"\n \"I know he did. Why?\"\n \"Because he was ordering me around.\"\n \"And you wouldn\u0027t stand for it?\"\n \"Would you, Captain?\"\n \"All right, then. You didn\u0027t stand for it. You fell down for it. Right on your face. How did that happen?\"\n \"I don\u0027t rightly know, Captain. He was fast. Like the camera was sped up. And he had a grip like iron.\"\n D.G. said, \"So he did. What did you expect, you idiot? He is iron.\"\n \"Captain?\"\n \"Niss, is it possible you don\u0027t know the story of Elijah Baley?\"\n Niss rubbed his ear in embarrassment. \"I know he\u0027s your great-something-grandfather, Captain.\"\n \"Yes, everyone knows that from my name. Have you ever viewed his life story?\"\n \"I\u0027m not a viewing man, Captain. Not on history.\" He shrugged and, as he did so, winced and made as though to rub his shoulder, then decided he didn\u0027t quite dare do so.\n \"Did you ever hear of R. Daneel Olivaw?\"\n Niss squeezed his brows together. \"He was Elijah Baley\u0027s friend.\"\n \"Yes, he was. You do know something then. Do you know what the \u0027R\u0027 stands for in R. Daneel Olivaw?\"\n \"It stands for \u0027Robot,\u0027 right? He was a robot friend. There was robots on Earth in them days.\"\n \"There were, Niss, and still are. But Daneel wasn\u0027t just a robot. He was a Spacer robot who looked like a Spacer man. Think about it, Niss. Guess who the Spacer man you picked a fight with really was.\"\n Niss\u0027s eyes widened, his face reddened dully. \"You mean that Spacer was a ro - \"\n \"That was R. Daneel Olivaw.\"\n \"But, Captain, that was two hundred years ago.\"\n \"Yes and the Spacer woman was a particular friend of my Ancestor Elijah. She\u0027s been alive for two hundred and thirty-three years, incase you still want to know, and do you think a robot can\u0027t do as well as that? You were trying to fight a robot, you great fool.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t it say so?\" Niss said with great indignation.\n \"Why should it? Did you ask? See here, Niss. You heard what I told the others about telling this to anyone. It goes for you, too, but much more so. They are only crewmen, but I had my eye on you for crew leader. Had my eye on you. If you\u0027re going to be in charge of the crew, you\u0027ve got to have brains and not just muscle. So now it\u0027s going to be harder for you because you\u0027re going to have to prove you have brains against my firm opinion that you don\u0027t.\"\n \"Captain, I - \"\n \"Don\u0027t talk. Listen. If this story gets out, the other four will be apprentice shippers, but you will be nothing. You will never go on shipboard again. No ship will take you, I promise you that. Not as crew, not as passenger. Ask yourself what kind of money you can make on Baleyworld and doing what? That\u0027s if you talk about this, or if you cross the Spacer woman in any way, or even just look at her for more than half a second at a time, or at her two robots. And you are going to have to see to it that no one else among the crew is in the least offensive. You\u0027re responsible. And you\u0027re fined two week\u0027s pay.\"\n \"But, Captain,\" said Niss weakly, \"the others - \"\n \"I expected less from the others, Niss, so I fined them less. Get out of here.\"\n 26\n D.G. played idly with the photocube that always stood on his desk. Each time he turned it, it blackened, then cleared when stood upon one of its sides as its base. When it cleared, the smiling three-dimensional image of a woman\u0027s head could be seen. - Crew rumor was that each of the six sides lead to the appearance of a different woman. The rumor was quite correct.\n Jamin Oser watched the flashing appearance and disappearance of images totally without interest. Now that the ship was secured - or as secured as it could be against attack of any expected variety - it was time to think of the next step.\n D.G., however, was approaching the matter obliquely - or, perhaps, not approaching it at all. He said, \"It was the woman\u0027s fault, of course.\"\n Oser shrugged and passed his hand over his beard, as though he were reassuring himself that he, at least, was not a woman. Unlike D.G., Oser had his upper lip luxuriantly covered as well.\n D.G. said, \"Apparently, being on the planet of her birth removed any thought of discretion. She left the ship, even though I had asked her not to.\"\n \"You might have ordered her not to.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know that that would have helped. She\u0027s a spoiled aristocrat, used to having her own way and to ordering her robots about. Besides, I plan to use her and I want her cooperation, not her pouting. And again - she was the Ancestor\u0027s friend. \"\n \"And still alive,\" said Oser, shaking his head. \"It makes the skin crawl. An old, old woman.\"\n \"I know, but she looks quite young. Still attractive. And nose in the air. Wouldn\u0027t retire when the crewmen approached, wouldn\u0027t shake hands with one of them. - Well, it\u0027s over.\"\n \"Still, Captain, was it the right thing to tell Niss he had tackled a robot?\"\n \"Had to! Had to, Oser. If he thought he\u0027d been beaten and humiliated before four of his mates by an effeminate Spacer half his size, he\u0027d be useless to us forever. It would have broken him completely. And we don\u0027t want anything to happen that will start the rumor that Spacers - that human Spacers - are supermen. That\u0027s why I had to order them so strenuously not to talk about it. Niss will ride herd on all of them - and if it does get out, it will also get out that the Spacer was a robot. - But I suppose there was a good side to the whole thing.\"\n \"Where, Captain?\" asked Oser.\n \"It got me to thinking about robots. How much do we know about them? How much do you know?\"\n Oser shrugged. \"Captain, it\u0027s not something I think about much.\"\n \"Or something anyone else thinks about, either. At least, any Settler. We know that the Spacers have robots, depend on them, go nowhere without them, can\u0027t do a thing without them, are parasites on them, and we\u0027re sure they\u0027re fading away because of them. We know that Earth once had robots forced on them by the Spacers and that they are gradually disappearing from Earth and are not found at all in Earth Cities, only in the countryside. We know that the Settler worlds don\u0027t and won\u0027t have them anywhere - town or country. So Settlers never meet them on their own worlds and hardly ever on Earth.\" (His voice had a curious inflection each time he said \"Earth,\" as though one could hear the capital, as though one could hear the words \"home\" and \"mother\" whispered behind it.) \"What else do we know?\"\n Oser said, \"There\u0027s the Three Laws of Robotics.\"\n \"Right,\" D.G. pushed the photocube to one side and leaned forward. \"Especially the First Law. \u0027A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\u0027 Yes? Well, don\u0027t rely on it. It doesn\u0027t mean a thing. We all feel ourselves to be absolutely safe from robots because of that and that\u0027s fine if it gives us confidence, but not if it gives us false confidence. R. Daneel injured Niss and it didn\u0027t bother the robot at all, First Law or no First Law.\"\n \"He was defending - \"\n \"Exactly. What if you must balance injuries? What if it was a case of either hurt Niss or allow your Spacer owner to come to harm? Naturally, she comes first.\"\n \"It makes sense.\"\n \"Of course it does. And here we are on a planet of robots, a couple of hundred million of them. What orders do they have? How do they balance the conflict between different harms? How can we be sure that none of them will touch us? Something on this planet has destroyed two ships already.\"\n Oser said uneasily, \"This R. Daneel is an unusual robot, looks more like a man than we do. It may be we can\u0027t generalize from him. That other robot, what\u0027s his name?\"\n \"Giskard. It\u0027s easy to remember. My name is Daneel Giskard.\"\n \"I think of you as captain, Captain. Anyway, that R. Giskard just stood there and didn\u0027t do a thing. He looks like a robot and he acts like one. We\u0027ve got lots of robots out there on Solaria watching us right now and they\u0027re not doing a thing, either. Just watching.\"\n \"And if there are some special robots that can harm us?\"\n \"I think we\u0027re prepared for them.\"\n \"Now we are. That\u0027s why the incident with Daneel and Niss was a good thing. We\u0027ve been thinking that we can only be in trouble if some of the Solarians are still here. They don\u0027t have to be. They can be gone. It may be that the robots - or at least some specially designed robots - can be dangerous. And if Lady Gladia can mobilize her robots in this place - it used to be her estate - and make them defend her and us, too, we may well be able to neutralize anything they\u0027ve left behind.\"\n \"Can she do that?\" said Oser.\n \"We\u0027re going to see,\" said D.G.\n 27\n \"Thank you, Daneel,\" Gladia said, \"You did well.\" Her face seemed pinched together, however. Her lips were thin and bloodless, her cheeks pale. Then, in a lower voice, \"I wish I had not come.\"\n Giskard said, \"It is a useless wish, Madam Gladia. Friend Daneel and I will remain outside the cabin to make sure you are not further disturbed.\"\n The corridor was empty and remained so, but Daneel and Giskard managed to speak in sound-wave intensities below the human threshold, exchanging thoughts in their brief and condensed way.\n Giskard said, \"Madam Gladia made an injudicious decision in refusing to retire. That is clear.\"\n \"I presume, friend Giskard,\" said Daneel, \"that there was no possibility of maneuvering her into changing that decision.\"\n \"It was far too firm, friend Daneel, and taken too quickly. The same was true of the intention of Niss, the Settler. Both his curiosity concerning Madam Gladia and his contempt and animosity toward you were too strong to manage without serious mental harm. The other four I could handle. It was quite possible to keep them from intervening, Their astonishment at your ability to handle Niss froze them naturally and I had only to strengthen that slightly.\"\n \"That was fortune, friend Giskard. Had those four joined Mr. Niss, I would have been faced with the difficult choice of forcing Madam Gladia into a humiliating retreat or of badly damaging one - or two - of the Settlers to frighten off the rest. I think I would have had to choose the former alternative but it, too, would have caused me grave discomfort.\"\n \"You are well, friend Daneel?\"\n \"Quite well. My damage to Mr. Niss was minimal.\"\n \"Physically, friend Daneel, it was. Within his mind, however, there was great humiliation, which was to him much worse than the physical damage. Since I could sense that, I could not have done what you did so easily. And yet, friend Daneel - \"\n \"Yes, friend Giskard?\"\n \"I am disturbed over the future. On Aurora, through all the decades of my existence, I have been able to work slowly, to wait for opportunities of touch in minds gently, without doing harm; of strengthening what is already there, of weakening what is already attenuated, of pushing gently in the direction of existing impulse. Now, however, we are coming to a time of crisis in which emotions will run high, decisions will be taken quickly, and events will race past us if I am to do any good at all, I will have to act quickly, too, and the Three Laws of Robotics prevent me from doing so. It takes time to weigh the subtleties of comparative physical and mental harm. Had I been alone with Madam Gladia at the time of the Settlers\u0027 approach, I do not see what course I could have taken that would not have recognized as entailing serious damage to Madam Gladia, to one or more of the Settlers, to myself - or possibly to all who were involved.\"\n Daneel said, \"What is there to do, friend Giskard?\"\n \"Since it is impossible to modify the Three Laws, friend Daneel, once again we must come to the conclusion that there is nothing we can do but await failure.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/robots-and-empire-robot-4/page-6.html","bookId":1727,"book":{"id":1727,"title":"Robots and Empire (Robot #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Robots and Empire (Robot #4) \n Isaac Asmiov\u0027s classic novel about the decline and fall of Solaria.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/robots-and-empire-robot-4.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/robots-and-empire-robot-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:11 AM"}}
