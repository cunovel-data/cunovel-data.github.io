{"id":88819,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"I need to call my mom,\" Hannah said. Thierry nodded. \"But maybe wait until she\u0027s up. It\u0027s not dawn yet.\" They were at Thierry\u0027s house, in the elegant bedroom with the softly burnished gold walls. The window had just begun to turn gray. It was so good to rest, to let go of tension, to feel her battered body relax. It was so good to be alive. She felt as if she\u0027d been reborn and was looking at the world with wide new eyes. Even the smallest comforts-a hot drink, a fire in the fireplace-were immeasurably precious. And it was good to be with Thierry. He was sitting on the bed, holding her hand, watching her as if he couldn\u0027t believe she was real. The healer had come and gone, and now it was just the two of them. They sat together quietly, not needing words. They looked into each other\u0027s eyes, and then they were reaching for each other, holding each other. Resting like weary travelers in each other\u0027s arms. Hannah leaned her forehead against Thierry\u0027s lips. It\u0027s over, she thought. I was right when I told Paul the apocalypse was coming-but it\u0027s over now. Thierry stirred, kissing the hair on her forehead. Then he spoke, not out loud but with his mental voice. As soon as Hannah heard it, she knew he was trying to say something serious and important. You know, you came very close to becoming a vampire. You \u0027re going to be sick for a few days while your body shifts back to human. Hannah nodded without pulling away to look at him. The healer had told her all that. She sensed that there was something more Thierry wanted to say. And... well, you still have a choice, you know. There was a silence. Then Hannah did pull away to look at him. \"What do you mean?\" He took a deep breath, then said out loud, \"I mean, you can still choose to be a vampire. You\u0027re right on the edge. If you want, we can make you change over.\" Hannah took a long breath of her own. She hadn\u0027t thought about this-but she was thinking now. As a vampire, she\u0027d be immortal; she could stay with Thierry continuously for who knew how many thousands of years? She would be stronger than a human, faster, telepathic. And perfect physically. Involuntarily, her hand went to her left cheek, to her birthmark. The doctors couldn\u0027t take it away. But becoming a vampire would. She looked directly at Thierry. \"Is that what you want? For me to become a vampire?\" He was looking at her cheek, too. Then he met her eyes. \"I want what you want. I want you to be happy. Nothing else matters to me.\" Hannah took her hand away. \"Then,\" she said very softly, \"if you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027ll stay human. I don\u0027t mind the birthmark. It\u0027s just-part of me, now. It doesn\u0027t bring up any bad memories.\" After a moment, she added, \"All humans are imperfect, I guess.\" She could see tears in Thierry\u0027s eyes. He gently lifted her hand and kissed it. He didn\u0027t say anything, but something about his expression made Hannah\u0027s throat and chest fill with love.. Then he took her in his arms. And Hannah was happy. So happy that she was crying a little, too. She was with her flying companion-her playmate. The one who was sacred to her, who was the other half of the mysteries of life for her. The one who would always be there for her, helping her, watching her back, picking her up when she fell down, listening to her stories-no matter how many times she told them. Loving her even when she was stupid. Understanding her without words. Being inside the innermost circle in her mind. Her soulmate. Things are going to be all right now, she thought. Suddenly it was as if she could see the corridor of time again, but this time looking forward, not back. She would go to college and become a paleontologist. And she and Thierry would work with Circle Daybreak and the Old Powers that were rising. They would be happy together, and they would help the world through the enormous changes that were coming. The sadness would go out of Thierry\u0027s eyes. They would love and discover and learn and explore. And Hannah would grow up and get older, and Thierry would love her just the same. And then one day, being human, she would go back to Mother Earth, like a wave going out to the ocean. Thierry would grieve for her-and wait for her. And then they would start all over again. One lifetime with him was enough, but Hannah sensed that there would be many. There would always be something new to learn. Thierry moved, his breath warming her hair. \"I almost forgot,\" he whispered. \"You\u0027re seventeen today. Congratulations.\" That\u0027s right, Hannah thought. She looked toward the window, startled and overwhelmed. The sky was turning pink now. She was seeing the dawn of her seventeenth birthday-something that had never happened before. I\u0027ve changed my destiny. \"I love you,\" she whispered to Thierry. And then they just sat together, holding each other as the room filled with light.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-17.html","bookId":2080,"book":{"id":2080,"title":"Night World : Soulmate (Night World #6)","description":"Storyline: Soulmate (Night World Book 6) Hannah Snow\u0027s life was perfect...until the notes started appearing.
