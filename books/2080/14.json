{"id":88816,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Stay here,\" Rashel said sharply, but Hannah ran with the rest of them toward the front of the house. She\n could hear a ferocious snarling and barking outside-a very familiar sort of sound.\n Nilsson and the other CIA guys were running around. They looked grim and efficient, moving fast but\n not frantically. Hannah realized that they knew how to do this sort of thing.\n She didn\u0027t see Lupe.\n The snarling outside got louder, building to a volley of short barks. There was a yelp-and then a\n scrambling noise. After a moment of silence there came a sound that lifted the hair on Hannah\u0027s\n forearms-a wild and eerie and beautiful sound. A wolf howling. Two other wolf voices joined the first,\n chording, rising and falling, interweaving with each other. Hannah found herself gasping, her entire skin\n shivering. Then there was one long sustained note and it was over.\n \"Wow,\" the tiny blond called Gillian whispered.\n Hannah rubbed her bare arms hard.\n The front door opened. Hannah felt herself looking toward the ground, but nothing four-legged came in.\n Instead it was Lupe and two guys, all disheveled, flushed, and grinning.\n \"It was just some scouts,\" Lupe said. \"We ran them off.\"\n \"Scouts from Maya?\" Hannah said, feeling a tightness in her stomach. It really was true, then. Maya was\n trying to storm the house to get to her.\n Lupe nodded. \"It\u0027ll be okay,\" she said almost gently. \"But I think all of you better stay inside today. You\n can watch movies or play games in the game room.\"\n Hannah spent the day talking with the Circle Daybreak members. The more she found out about them,\n the more she liked them. Only one thing made her uncomfortable. They all seemed to defer to her-as if,\n somehow, they expected her to be wiser or better because of her former lifetimes. It was embarrassing,\n because she knew she wasn\u0027t.\n She tried to keep her mind off Thierry... and Maya.\n But it wasn\u0027t easy. That night she found herself walking restlessly through the house. She wound up in a\n little anteroom on the second floor that looked down on the enormous living room.\n \"Can\u0027t relax?\"\n The lazy murmur came from behind her. Hannah turned to see Ash, his lanky elegant body propped\n against a wall. His eyes looked silver in the dimly lit room.\n \"Not really,\" Hannah admitted. \"I just wish they\u0027d find Thierry. I\u0027ve got a bad feeling about it.\"\n They stood for a moment in silence. Then Ash said, \"Yeah, it\u0027s hard to be without your soulmate. Once\n you\u0027ve found them, I mean.\"\n Hannah looked at him, intrigued. The way he said that...\n She spoke hesitantly. \"This morning Thea said you were all here because you had human soulmates.\"\n He looked across the room at French doors that led to a balcony. \"Yes?\"\n \"And-well...\" Maybe she\u0027s dead, Hannah thought suddenly. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t ask. \"And you\n want to know where mine is,\" Ash said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to pry.\"\n \"No. It\u0027s okay.\" Ash looked out at the darkness beyond the French doors again. \"She\u0027s waiting-I hope.\n I\u0027ve got some things to put right before I see her.\"\n He didn\u0027t seem scary anymore, no matter how his eyes changed. He seemed-vulnerable.\n \"I\u0027m sure she is waiting,\" Hannah said. \"And I\u0027ll bet she\u0027ll be glad to see you when you\u0027ve put things\n right.\" She added quietly, \"I know I\u0027ll be glad to see Thierry.\"\n He glanced at her, startled, then smiled. He had a very nice smile. \"That\u0027s true, you\u0027ve been in her shoes,\n haven\u0027t you? And Thierry\u0027s certainly tried to make up for his past. I mean, he\u0027s been doing good works\n for centuries. So maybe there\u0027s hope for me after all.\"\n He said it almost mockingly, but Hannah caught an odd glistening in his eyes. \"You\u0027re like her, you\n know,\" he added abruptly.\n \"Like my-like Mary-Lynnette. You\u0027re both... wise.\"\n Before Hannah could think of something to say to that, he nodded to her, straightened up, and went\n back into the hallway, whistling softly through his teeth.\n Hannah stood alone in the dim room. For some reason, she felt better suddenly. More optimistic about\n the future.\n I think I\u0027ll be able to sleep tonight. And tomorrow, maybe Thierry will be here.\n She clamped down hard on the rush of hope that filled her at the thought. Hope... and concern. After\n all she\u0027d said to him, she couldn\u0027t be absolutely sure how Thierry would receive her. What if he doesn\u0027t\n want me after all? Don\u0027t be silly. Don\u0027t think about it. Go outside and get a breath of air, and then go to\n Later, of course, she realized just how stupid she had been. She should have known that getting a breath\n of fresh air only led to one thing in her life. But at the moment it seemed like a good idea. Lupe had\n warned her not to open any outside doors-but the French doors only led to a second-floor balcony\n overlooking the backyard. Hannah opened them and stepped out.\n Nice, she thought. The air was just cool enough to be pleasant.\n From here she could look across dark stretches of grass to flood-lit palm trees and softly splashing\n fountains. Although she couldn\u0027t see Thierry\u0027s people, she knew they were out there, stationed around the\n grounds, watching and waiting. Guarding her. It made her feel safe.\n Nothing can get to the house with them around it, she thought. I can sleep just fine.\n She was about to turn and go back inside when she heard the scratching.\n It came from above her. From the roof. She glanced up and got the shock of this particular lifetime.\n There was a bat hanging from the roof.\n A bat. A bat.\n A huge bat. Upside down. Its leathery black wings were wrapped around it and its small red eyes shone\n at her with reflected light.\n Wild thoughts tumbled through Hannah\u0027s mind, all in a fraction of an instant. Maybe it\u0027s a decoration...\n no, idiot, it\u0027s alive. Maybe it\u0027s somebody to guard me. God, maybe it\u0027s Thierry....\n But all the while, she knew. And when the instant of paralysis passed and she could command her body\n again, she sucked in a deep breath to scream an alarm.\n She never got the chance to make a sound. With a noise like an umbrella opening, the bat unfolded its\n wings suddenly, displaying an amazingly large span of black membrane.\n At the same moment something like sheet lightning seemed to hit Hannah, a blinding surge of pure mental\n energy. She saw stars, and then everything faded to darkness.\n Something hurt.\n My head, Hannah thought slowly. And my back. In fact, she hurt all over. And she was blind-or she had\n her eyes shut. She tried to open them and\n nothing changed. She could feel herself blinking, but she could only see one thing. Blackness. Utter,\n complete blackness. She realized then that she\u0027d never seen real darkness before. In her bedroom at\n night there was always some diffused light showing at the top of her curtains. Even outdoors there was\n always moonlight or starlight, or if it were cloudy, the reflection of human lights, however faint.\n This was different. This was solid darkness. Hannah imagined she could feel it pressing against her face,\n weighing down on her body. And no matter how wide she opened her eyes or how fixedly she stared,\n she couldn\u0027t see even the slightest glimmer breaking it.\n I will not panic, she told herself.\n But it was hard. She was fighting an instinctive fear, hardwired into the brain since before the Stone Age.\n All humans panicked in complete blackness.\n Just breathe, she told herself firmly. Breathe. Okay. Now. You\u0027ve got to get out of here. First things first.\n Are you hurt?\n She couldn\u0027t tell. She had to shut her eyes in order to sense her own body. As she did, she realized that\n she was sitting up, instinctively huddling into herself to keep safe from the darkness.\n Okay. I don\u0027t think you\u0027re hurt. Let\u0027s try standing up. Very slowly.\n That was when the real shock came.\n She couldn\u0027t stand up.\n She couldn\u0027t.\n She could move her arms and even her legs. But when she tried to lift her body, even to shift position\n slightly, something bit into her waist, keeping her immobile.\n With a crawling feeling of horror, Hannah put her hands to her waist and felt the rough texture of rope.\n I\u0027m tied. I\u0027m tied....\n There was something hard against her back. A tree? Her hands flew to feel it. No, not a tree-too\n regular. Tall, but squarish. A post of some kind.\n The rope seemed to be wound many times around her waist, tightly enough that it constricted her\n breathing a little. It bound her securely to the post. And then it fastened above or far behind her\n somewhere-she couldn\u0027t find any knots with her fingers.\n It felt like very strong, very sturdy rope. Hannah knew without question that she wasn\u0027t going to be able\n to wiggle out of it or untie it.\n The post seemed very sturdy, too. The ground under Hannah was dirt and rock.\n I\u0027m alone, she thought slowly. She could hear her own gasping breath. I\u0027m all alone... and I\u0027m tied here\n in the dark. I can\u0027t move. I can\u0027t get away.\n Maya put me here. She left me to die all alone in the dark.\n For a while, then, Hannah simply lost control. She screamed for help and heard her voice echo oddly.\n She pulled and twisted at the rope with her fingers until her fingertips were raw. She threw her whole\n body from one side to the other, trying to loosen the rope or the post, until the pain in her waist made her\n stop. And finally she gave in to the galloping fear inside her and sobbed out loud.\n She had never, ever, felt so desolate and alone.\n In the end, though, she cried herself out. And when she\u0027d gasped to a stop, she found that she could\n think a little.\n Listen, girl. You\u0027ve got to get a grip. You\u0027ve got to help yourself, because there\u0027s nobody else to do it.\n It wasn\u0027t the cool wind voice or even the crystal voice-because they were both just part of her now. It\n was Hannah\u0027s own mental voice. She had accepted all her past selves and their experiences, and in return\n she felt she could call on at least some of their wisdom.\n Okay, she thought grimly. No more crying. Think. What can you tell about your situation?\n I\u0027m not out in the open. I know because there\u0027s no light at all and because of the way my voice echoed.\n I\u0027m in a big... room or something. It\u0027s got a high ceiling. And the floor is rock.\n Good. Okay, do you hear anything else?\n Hannah listened. It was hard to concentrate on the silence around her-it made her own breathing and\n heartbeat seem terrifyingly loud. She could feel her nerves stretch and fray... but she held on, ignoring\n her own noises and trying to reach out into the darkness with her ears.\n Then she heard it. Very far away, a sound like a faucet dripping slowly.\n What the hell? I\u0027m in a big black room with a rock floor and a leaky faucet.\n Shut up. Keep concentrating. What do you smell?\n Hannah sniffed. That didn\u0027t work, so she took long breaths through her nose, ignoring the pain as her\n midsection pressed against the rope.\n It\u0027s musty in here. Dank. It smells damp and cold.\n In fact, it was very cold. Her panic had kept her warm before, but now she realized that her fingers were\n icy and her arms and legs were stiff.\n Okay, so what have we got? I\u0027m in a big black refrigerated room with a high ceiling and a stone floor.\n And it\u0027s musty and damp.\n A cellar? A cellar without windows?\n But she was just fooling herself. She knew. The skin of her face seemed to sense the pressure of tons of\n rock above her. Her ears told her that that musical dripping was water on rock, very far away. Her nose\n told her that she wasn\u0027t in any building. And her fingers could feel the natural irregularity of the ground\n underneath her.\n She didn\u0027t want to believe it. But the knowledge crowded in on her, inescapable.\n I\u0027m in a cave.\n A cave or a cavern. Anyway, I\u0027m inside the earth. God knows how deep inside. Deep enough and far\n enough that I can\u0027t see any light from an entrance or vent hole.\n Very deep inside, her heart told her.\n She was in the loneliest place in the world. And she was going to die here.\n Hannah had never had claustrophobia before. But now she couldn\u0027t help feeling that the mass of rock\n around and above her was trying to crush her. It could fall in at any minute, she thought. She felt a\n physical pressure, as if she were at the bottom of the ocean. She began to have trouble breathing.\n She had to get her mind off it. She refused to turn into that screaming, gibbering thing in the darkness\n again. Worse than the thought of dying was the thought of going insane down here.\n Think about Thierry. When he finds out you\u0027re missing he\u0027ll start looking for you. You know that. And he\n won\u0027t give up until he finds you. But I\u0027ll be dead by then, she thought involuntarily. This time, instead of\n fear, the idea of her death brought a strange poignant loneliness.\n Another life where I missed him, she thought. She blinked against tears suddenly. Oh, God. Great.\n It\u0027s so hard. So hard to keep hoping that someday it\u0027s going to work out. But I\u0027ll meet him again in my\n next life. And maybe I won\u0027t be so stupid then; I won\u0027t fall for Maya\u0027s tricks.\n It\u0027ll be harder for him, I guess. He\u0027ll have to wait and get through the years day by day. I\u0027ll just go to\n sleep and eventually wake up somewhere else. And then someday he\u0027ll come for me and I\u0027ll remember . .\n . and then we\u0027ll start all over.\n I really did try this time, Thierry. I did my best. I didn\u0027t mean to mess things up. Promise me you\u0027ll look\n for me again. Promise you\u0027ll find me. I promise I\u0027ll wait for you. No matter how long it takes. Hannah shut\n her eyes, leaning back against the post and almost unconsciously touching the ring he\u0027d given her. Maybe\n next time she\u0027d remember it.\n Suddenly she didn\u0027t feel sad or afraid anymore. Just very tired.\n Eyes still shut, she grinned weakly. I feel old. Like Mom\u0027s always complaining she feels. Ready to turn\n this old body in and get a new...\n The thought broke off and disappeared.\n Was that a noise?\n Hannah found herself sitting up, leaning forward as far as the rope would allow, straining her ears.\n She thought she\u0027d heard... yes. There it was again. A solid echoing sound out in the darkness.\n It sounded like footsteps. And it was coming closer.\n Yes, yes. I\u0027m rescued, I\u0027m saved. Hannah\u0027s heart was pounding so hard that she could hardly breathe to\n yell. But at last, just as she saw a bobbing point of light in the blackness, she managed to get out a hoarse\n squawk.\n \"Thierry? Hello? I\u0027m over here!\"\n The light kept coming toward her. She could hear the footsteps coming closer.\n And there was no answer.\n \"Thierry... ?\" Her voice trailed off.\n Footsteps. The light was big now. It was a beam, a flashlight. Hannah blinked at it.\n Her heart was slowly sinking, until it seemed to reach stone.\n And then the flashlight was right in front of her. It shone in her face, dazzling her eyes. Another light\n snapped on, a small camping lantern. Vision rushed back to Hannah, sending information surging to her\n brain.\n But there was no happiness in it. Hannah\u0027s entire body was ice cold now, shivering.\n Because of course it wasn\u0027t Thierry. It was Maya.\n I hope I didn\u0027t disturb you,\" Maya said.\n She put down the lantern and what looked like a black backpack. Then she stood with her hands on her\n hips and looked at Hannah.\n I will not cry. I won\u0027t give her the satisfaction, Hannah thought.\n \"I didn\u0027t know vampires could really change into bats,\" she said.\n Maya laughed. She looked beautiful in the pool of lantern light. Her long black hair fell in waves around\n her, hanging down her back to her hips. Her skin was milky-pale and her eyes looked dark and\n mysterious. Her laughing mouth was red.\n She was wearing designer jeans and high-heeled snakeskin boots. Funny, Hannah had never noticed any\n of Maya\u0027s clothes before. Usually the woman herself was so striking that it was impossible to focus on\n how she was dressed.\n \"Not all vampires can shapeshift,\" Maya said. \"But, then, I\u0027m not like other vampires. I\u0027m the first, my\n darling. I\u0027m the original. And I have to say I\u0027m getting really sick of you.\"\n The feeling is mutual, Hannah thought. She said, \"Then why don\u0027t you leave me alone? Why don\u0027t you\n leave me and Thierry alone?\"\n \"Because, then, my sweetpea, I wouldn\u0027t win. And I have to win.\" She looked at Hannah directly, her\n face oddly serious. \"Don\u0027t you understand that yet?\" she said softly. \"I have to win-because I\u0027ve given up\n too much to lose. It can\u0027t all be for nothing. So winning is all there is.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-14.html","bookId":2080,"book":{"id":2080,"title":"Night World : Soulmate (Night World #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Soulmate (Night World Book 6) \n Hannah Snow\u0027s life was perfect...until the notes started appearing.
