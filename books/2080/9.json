{"id":88811,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"You\u0027ll change your mind,\" Thierry said.\n An instant later everything was chaos. Thierry had one hand in her hair, twisting her head to the side,\n exposing her neck. His other arm was keeping both her arms trapped against her body. Hannah was\n twisting, struggling-and it wasn\u0027t doing any good. He was unbelievably strong.\n She felt the warmth of breath on her neck . .. and then the sharpness of teeth.\n \"Don\u0027t fight.\" Thierry\u0027s muffled voice came to her. \"You\u0027ll only make it hurt worse.\"\n Hannah fought. And it did hurt. The pain of having blood drawn out against her will was like nothing\n she\u0027d ever felt. It was as if her soul was being pulled out of her body, a pain that radiated down her neck\n and through her left shoulder and arm. It turned her vision gray and made her feel lightheaded.\n \"I-hate-you,\" she got out. She tried to reach for him with her mind, to see if she could hurt him that way .\n . . but it was like running up against an obsidian wall. She could feel nothing of Thierry in the contact, just\n smooth black hardness.\n Forget about that, the cool wind voice said. And don\u0027t faint; you\u0027ve got to stay conscious. Think about\n your room. You need wood; you need a weapon. Where...\n The desk.\n Even as she thought it, Thierry\u0027s grip on her was shifting. He was forcing her to turn so she faced away\n from him, still holding her in an iron grip with one arm. She had no idea what he was doing with the other\n arm until he spoke again.\n \"I have to give you back something for what I took.\"\n And then the other arm was in front of Hannah, wrist pressing to her mouth. She still didn\u0027t really\n understand-she was dazed with pain and loss of blood-until she felt warm liquid trickling into her mouth\n and tasted a strange exotic taste.\n Oh, God-no. It\u0027s his blood. You\u0027re drinking vampire blood.\n She tried not to swallow, but the liquid kept flowing in, choking her. It didn\u0027t taste at all like blood. It\n was rich and wild and burned slightly-and she could almost feel it changing her.\n You\u0027ve got to stop this, the cool wind voice told her. New.\n With a violent wrench that almost dislocated her shoulder, Hannah got one arm free. Then she started to\n fight hard, not because she wanted to get away, but because she wanted to keep Thierry occupied in\n holding her. While they were struggling, she surreptitiously reached out with her free hand.\n I can\u0027t feel it. She threw her body back and forth, trying to get Thierry to move closer to the desk. Just a\n little farther... there. There!\n Her fingers were on her desk. She stomped on Thierry\u0027s foot to keep him distracted. She heard a snarl\n of pain and Thierry shook her, but her fingers kept groping across the desk until they found something\n smooth and long, with a pointed graphite end.\n A pencil.\n Hannah curled her fingers, gathering the pencil into her fist. She was gasping with effort, which meant\n more of the strange blood was flowing into her mouth.\n Now think. Visualize his hand. Picture the pencil going right in, all the way through. And now strike.\n Hannah brought the pencil up with all her strength, driving it into the back of Thierry\u0027s hand.\n She heard a yelp of pain and outrage-and at the same instant she felt a stab of pain herself. She\u0027d driven\n the pencil all the way through his hand and jabbed her own cheek.\n She didn\u0027t spend time worrying about it. The iron grip on her had loosened. She slammed a foot into\n Thierry\u0027s shin and spun away as he jerked back.\n The desk! You need another weapon!\n Even as the voice was telling her, Hannah was teaching for her desk, gathering a random handful of pens\n and pencils. Thank God for her habit of losing pencils, which was the reason she had to keep so many.\n As soon as she had them, she twisted to dart across the room, getting her back to a wall. She faced\n Thierry, panting.\n \"This next one goes right into your heart,\" she told him, pulling one pencil out of the handful and holding it\n in her fist. Her voice was soft and ragged, but absolutely deadly in its conviction.\n \"You hurt me!\" Thierry had pulled the pencil out and was staring at the wound. His face was contorted,\n his eyes blazing with animal pain and fury. He looked like a stranger.\n \"Right,\" Hannah said, panting. \"And if you come close to me again, I\u0027ll kill you. That\u0027s a promise. Now\n get the hell out of my house and out of my life!\"\n Thierry stared back and forth from her to his hand. Then he snarled-really snarled, his upper lip lifting,\n his teeth bared. Hannah had never seen a human face look so bestial.\n \"You\u0027ll be sorry,\" he said, like a child in a temper tantrum. \"And if you tell anybody about this, I\u0027ll kill\n them. I will. It\u0027s Night World law.\"\n Then he did the fade-out thing. Hannah blinked and he wasn\u0027t there. He must have backed up down the\n hall, but she didn\u0027t hear a door open or close.\n It was several minutes before she could loosen her grip on her pencil or step away from the wall. When\n she could, it was to stumble toward the phone. She pressed the speed dial for Chess\u0027s number. Busy.\n Hannah dropped the phone. She was swaying on her feet, feeling sick and giddy, but she headed for the\n dining room. There, keeping one of the windows shut, was a wooden dowel, the remnant of some\n long-past safety craze of her mother\u0027s. Hannah broke it over her knee and carried one splinter-ended\n piece with her to the garage.\n The dusty old Ford was parked there, the one her\n father had driven before he died. Hannah found the keys and started for Chess\u0027s house. She could think\n of only one thing: she didn\u0027t want to be alone.\n Gray spots danced in front of her eyes as she drove. She kept imagining things rushing at her from the\n prairie.\n Stay awake. Just stay awake, she told herself, biting her lip hard enough to draw blood.\n There! There\u0027s the house up ahead. You can see the light. All you have to do is get there.\n She stepped on the accelerator. And then everything went gray.\n Thierry looked around the resort lobby, then glanced at his watch. He\u0027d been doing that every five\n minutes for about the last twelve hours, and his nerves were starting to fray.\n He didn\u0027t like leaving Hannah alone. Of course, the ring would protect her when she was away from the\n house, and the amulet he\u0027d buried in her backyard would protect the house itself. It was a strong amulet,\n made for him by Grandma Harman, the oldest and most powerful witch in the world, the Crone of the\n Inner Circle. It set wards around the house, so that no Night Person could enter without a direct\n invitation from somebody who lived inside.\n He still didn\u0027t like leaving Hannah alone.\n Only a little while longer, he told himself. It had \u0027taken him most of last night and all of today to call in\n enough of his own people to set up a plan for watching over Hannah.\n She\u0027d told him to go away, and he had. Her word was law to him. But that didn\u0027t mean he couldn\u0027t have\n her guarded. She need never realize that there\n were Night People around her, watching and waiting in the shadows-and ready to fight to the death if\n any danger appeared.\n Lupe had been right. He couldn\u0027t deal with this alone. And now he was going to have to rely on other\n people to keep Hannah safe.\n Thierry looked at his watch again. It was nine o\u0027clock at night, and he was almost tempted to give up on\n Circe. But only a witch of her power could set up the kind of heavy-duty wards that would protect\n Hannah wherever she went in Amador County.\n He kept waiting. As he did, he stared at a gun rack on the wall and tried to keep his brain turned off. It\n didn\u0027t work.\n Ever since he\u0027d awoken Hannah from her hypnotic trance, he\u0027d been trying very hard not to think about\n the old days. But now, he found himself being irresistibly drawn back-not only thinking about them, but\n reliving them. Traveling back in his mind to the stupid young man he had been....\n He hadn\u0027t been the first vampire. He didn\u0027t have that distinction.\n He had only been the second.\n He\u0027d grown up in the tribe of Maya and Hellewise. The Maya and Hellewise, the twin daughters of\n Hecate Witch Queen. The Maya and Hellewise who would go down as the two greatest figures in Night\n World history; Hellewise Hearth-Woman as the ancestress of the Harman family, the most famous of the\n living witches, and Maya as the ancestress of both the lamia and the made vampires.\n But of course he knew nothing about that at the time.\n All he knew was that they were both pretty girls. Beautiful. Hellewise had long yellow hair and deep\n brown eyes. Maya had long black hair and eyes that glittered in different colors like the changing lights in\n a glacier. He liked both sisters very much.\n Maybe that was his downfall.\n He\u0027d been a very ordinary fellow, with a good throwing arm, a delicate touch in carving ivory, and a\n vague longing to see the world. He\u0027d taken it for granted that his tribe was special, that they could\n influence the weather and summon animals from the forest. They were the witch people, they\u0027d been\n granted special powers, and that was all. It wasn\u0027t anything to worry about.\n And, like everyone else, he knew that Maya was doing experiments in the forest, using her powers to try\n and become immortal. But that didn\u0027t worry him particularly either....\n I was very young and very, very stupid, Thierry thought.\n That had been the real downfall of the tribe. Maya\u0027s desire to become immortal. Because she\u0027d been\n willing to pay any price for it, even to the point of becoming a monster and leaving a curse on all her\n descendants. Maybe if Thierry and the other witch people had realized that, they could have stopped her\n before it happened.\n Because Maya had finally found the right spell to achieve immortality. The problem was that to do it, she\n had to steal the babies of the tribe. All four of them. She took them out to the forest, did the spell, and\n drank their blood. Thierry and the rest of the tribe found the four little bled-out bodies later.\n Hellewise had cried all night. Thierry, who couldn\u0027t understand how the pretty girl he liked could have\n done something so awful, cried, too. Maya herself had disappeared completely.\n But a few nights later she came to Thierry. He was keeping watch outside the cave when she appeared\n silently beside him.\n She had changed.\n She wasn\u0027t the pretty girl he knew anymore. She was stunningly, dazzlingly beautiful. But she was\n different. She moved with the grace of a nighttime predator, and her eyes reflected the firelight.\n She was very pale, but that only made her more lovely. Her mouth, which had always been soft and\n inviting, seemed red as blood. And when she smiled at him, he saw her long pointed teeth.\n \"Hello, Theory,\" she said-that was his name back then. \"I want to make you immortal.\"\n Thierry was scared out of his mind.\n He had no idea what she\u0027d become-some weird creature with unnatural teeth. But he knew he had no\n desire at all to be like her.\n \"I really think it\u0027s unfair, the way you go back and forth between me and Hellewise,\" she said casually,\n sitting down on the bare earth. \"So I\u0027ve decided to resolve the question. You\u0027re going to be mine, now\n and forever.\"\n She reached out and took his hand. Her fingers were very slender and very cold-and unbelievably\n strong. Thierry couldn\u0027t pull away. He stared at his hand with his mouth open like the idiot he was.\n This was the time he should have started yelling, thrashing, doing anything to attract attention and get\n away. But Maya seemed to hold him with her eyes\n like a snake holding a bird. She was unnatural and evil... but she was so beautiful.\n It was the first and the last time that Thierry would be fascinated by the beauty of pure evil-but it was\n enough. He was doomed from that moment. He\u0027d doomed himself.\n An instant of hesitation. He would pay for it for unimaginable years in the future.\n \"It\u0027s not so bad,\" Maya was saying, still fixing him with her terrible and lovely eyes. \"There are a few\n things I had to figure out-a few things I didn\u0027t expect. I thought drinking the blood of the babies would be\n the end of it, but no.\"\n Thierry felt sick.\n \"I\u0027ve got these teeth for a reason, apparently. It seems I have to drink the blood of a mortal creature\n every day, or I die. It\u0027s inconvenient, but I can live with it.\"\n Thierry whispered something beginning with, \"Oh, Hecate, Dark Mother-\"\n \"Now, stop that!\" Maya made a sharp gesture. \"No praying, please, and especially not to that old\n harridan. I\u0027m not a witch anymore. I\u0027m something completely new-I suppose I should think of a name for\n myself. Night-hunter... blood-drinker ... I don\u0027t know, the possibilities are endless. I\u0027m going to start a\n new race, Theorn. We\u0027ll be better than the witches, stronger, faster-and we\u0027ll live forever. We\u0027ll never\n die, so we\u0027ll rule everyone. And you\u0027re going to be my first convert.\"\n \"No,\" Thierry said. He still thought he had a choice.\n \"Yes. I\u0027m going to have a baby-not with you, I\u0027m afraid; I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be able to-and the baby will\n have my blood. And I\u0027m going to give my blood to other people the way I\u0027ll give it to you now. Someday\n there won\u0027t be anyone in the world who won\u0027t have my blood. It\u0027s a nice thought, isn\u0027t it?\" She rested her\n chin on a fist and her eyes glittered.\n \"Hellewise will stop you,\" Thierry said flatly.\n \"My sister? No, I don\u0027t think so. Especially not since I\u0027ll have you to help me. She likes you, you know.\n It will be hard for her to kill somebody she likes so much.\"\n \"She won\u0027t have to. I\u0027ll kill you,\" Thierry snarled.\n Maya laughed out loud.\n \"You? You? Don\u0027t you know yourself yet? You\u0027re not a killer-you don\u0027t have the guts for it. That will\n change, of course, after I give you my blood. But you won\u0027t want to kill me then. You\u0027ll join me-and be\n happy. You\u0027ll see.\" She dusted off her hands as if a difficult negotiation had been accomplished and terms\n had been reached. \"Now. Let\u0027s do it.\"\n He was strong. He had that good throwing arm-he was dead accurate with a spear or a killing stick. But\n she was so much stronger that she could handle him like a baby. The first thing she did was clamp a hand\n across his mouth-because by this time it had occurred even to stupid Thierry that he was in very bad\n trouble, and that he needed help.\n There was no sound of a struggle as she dragged him off into the bushes.\n \"I\u0027m afraid this is going to hurt,\" she said. She was lying on top of him, her eyes glittering into his. She\n was excited. \"At least, all the animals I\u0027ve caught seem to have found it very unpleasant. But it\u0027s for your\n own good.\"\n Then she ripped his throat out.\n That was what it felt like. And that was when he realized what those long canine teeth were for. Like any\n lynx or cave lion or wolf, she needed teeth to tear.\n Through the black waves of shock and pain, he heard her drinking.\n It lasted a long time. But finally, mercifully, he realized that he was dying. He took comfort in the thought\n that the horror would soon be over.\n He couldn\u0027t have been more wrong. The horror was just beginning.\n When Maya lifted her head, her mouth was scarlet with his blood. Dripping. She wasn\u0027t beautiful any\n longer, she was simply fiendish.\n \"Now,\" she said. \"I\u0027m going to give you something that will make it all better.\"\n She pulled back and placed a fire-hardened splinter of wood at her own throat. She smiled at him.\n Maya had always been physically brave. And then, with a gesture almost of ecstasy, she plunged the\n splinter in, sending blood spurting and spilling.\n Then she fell on top of him again.\n He didn\u0027t mean to swallow the blood that filled his mouth. But everything was so gray and unreal-and he\n still had enough survival reflex left to not want to drown in it. The warm, strange-tasting liquid went down\n his throat. It burned like fermented-berry wine.\n After she made him drink, he realized to his relief that he was still dying. He didn\u0027t know that he wasn\u0027t\n going to stay dead. He felt her carrying him farther into the forest-he was completely limp now and didn\u0027t\n put up any resistance-and then everything went black.\n When he woke up, he\u0027d been buried.\n He clawed himself up out of the shallow grave and found himself looking into the astonished face of his\n brother Conlan. The tribe had buried him in the traditional way-in the soft dirt at the back of the cave.\n In the minute before his brother could yell in surprise, Thierry was at his throat.\n It was animal instinct. A thirst inside of him like nothing he had ever known. A pain that was like being\n underwater-being strangled-gasping for air. It made him desperate, made him insane. He didn\u0027t think at\n He simply tried, mindlessly, to tear at his brother\u0027s throat.\n What stopped him was someone calling his name. Calling it over and over, in great pain. When he\n looked around, he saw Hellewise, her brown eyes huge and spilling with tears, her mouth trembling.\n The expression on her face would haunt him forever.\n He ran out of the cave and kept running. Behind him, just faintly, he could hear Hellewise\u0027s voice,\n \"Theorn, I\u0027ll stop her. I swear to you, I\u0027ll stop her.\"\n He realized later that it was all Hellewise could offer him. She knew that his curse was permanent. What\n he was now, he would be forever.\n There wasn\u0027t a name for it then, but he was the first made vampire. Maya, who would have a son just as\n she promised, was the first of the lamia, the family vampires who could grow up and have children. And\n her son, Red Fern, would be the ancestor of the Redfern family, the most powerful lamia family in the\n Night World.\n Thierry didn\u0027t know any of that as he ran. He only knew he had to get away from people, or he would\n hurt them.\n Maya caught up with him while he was frantically trying to quench his thirst by drinking from a stream.\n \"You\u0027re going to make yourself sick,\" she said, inspecting him critically. \"You can\u0027t drink that. It\u0027s blood\n you need.\"\n Thierry jumped up, shaking with fury and hatred and weakness all mixed together. \"What about yours?\"\n he snarled.\n Maya laughed. \"How sweet. But it won\u0027t do. You need the blood of living creatures.\" She wasn\u0027t at all\n afraid of him, and he remembered how strong she had been. He was no match for her.\n He turned and began to stumble off.\n Maya called after him, \"You can\u0027t do it, you know. You can\u0027t get away from me. I\u0027ve chosen you,\n Theorn. You\u0027re mine, now and forever. And in the end you\u0027ll realize that and join me.\"\n Thierry kept going. He could hear her laughing as he went.\n He lived on the steppes for several weeks, wandering across the high windswept grasslands. He was\n more an animal than anything resembling a person. The thirst inside him made him desperate-until he\n stumbled over a rabbit. The next instant he found that he was holding it, biting into its throat. His teeth\n were like Maya\u0027s now-long, sensitive, and perfect for tearing or puncturing. And she was right, only the\n blood of a living creature could help the burning, suffocating feeling inside him.\n He didn\u0027t catch food very often. Every time he drank it reminded him of what he was.\n He was starving when he finally came to the Three Rivers.\n He didn\u0027t see the little girl out picking spring greens until he was on top of her. He burst out of a pile of\n brush, panting with thirst like a wounded deer-and there she was, looking up at him. And then everything\n went dark for a while.\n When he came to himself, he stopped drinking. He needed the food, he would die in terrible agony\n without it-but he dropped the girl and ran. Hana\u0027s people found him a little while later.\n And they did exactly what he\u0027d expected any tribe to do-they saw that he was an abomination and\n brandished spears at him. He expected them to kill him at any minute. He didn\u0027t realize yet-and neither\n did they-that a creature like him took some killing.\n And then he saw Hana. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-9.html","bookId":2080,"book":{"id":2080,"title":"Night World : Soulmate (Night World #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Soulmate (Night World Book 6) \n Hannah Snow\u0027s life was perfect...until the notes started appearing.
