{"id":88809,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"It was like being struck by lightning. Hannah felt the current through her body, but it was her mind that was most affected. I know you! It was as if she had been standing in a dark landscape, lost and blind, when suddenly a brilliant flash illuminated everything, allowing her to see farther than she\u0027d ever seen before. She was trembling violently, pitching forward even as he fell toward her. Electricity was running through every nerve in her body and she was shaking and shaking, overcome by waves of the purest emotion she\u0027d ever felt. Fury. \"You were supposed to be there!\" She got out in a choked gasp. \"Where were you?\" You were supposed to be with me-for so long! You\u0027re part of me, the part I\u0027ve always vaguely missed. You were supposed to be around, helping out, picking me up when I fell down. Watching my back, listening to my stories. Understanding things that I wouldn\u0027t want to tell other people. Loving me when I\u0027m stupid. Giving me something to take care of and be good to, the way the Goddess meant women to do. Hannah- It was the closest thing to a mental gasp Hannah could imagine, and with it she realized that somehow they were directly connected now. He could hear her thoughts, just as she could hear his. Good! she thought, not wasting time to marvel over this. Her mind was raging on. You were my flying companion! My playmate! You were my other half of the mysteries! We were supposed to be sacred to each other-and you haven\u0027t been there! This last thought she sent squarely toward him. And she felt it hit him, and felt his reaction. \"I\u0027ve tried!\" He was horrified... guilt-stricken. But then, Hannah could sense that this was pretty much the usual state for him, so it didn\u0027t affect him quite as much as it might have someone else. And beneath the horror was an astonishment and burgeoning joy that sent a different kind of tingle through her. \"You do know me, don\u0027t you?\" he said quietly. He pushed her back to look at her, as if he still couldn\u0027t believe it. \"You remember... Hannah, how much do you remember?\" Hannah was looking at him, studying him.... Yes, I know that bone structure. And the eyes, especially the eyes. It was like an adopted child discovering a brother or sister and seeing familiar features in an unfamiliar face, tracing each one with wonder and recognition. \"I remember... that we were meant for each other. That we\u0027re\"-she came up with the word slowly-\u0027 \u0027soulmates.\u0027\u0027 \"Yes,\" he whispered. Awe was softening his features, changing his eyes. The desperate sadness that seemed so much a part of them was lightening. \"Soulmates. We were destined for each other. We should have been together down the ages.\" They were supporting each other now, Hannah kneeling on the porch and Thierry holding her with one knee on a step. Their faces were inches apart. Hannah found herself watching his mouth. \"So what happened?\" she whispered. In the same tone, without moving back, he whispered, \"I screwed up.\" \"Oh.\" Her initial fury had faded. She could feel him, feel his emotions, sense his thoughts. He was as anguished at their separation as she was. He wanted her. He loved her... adored her. He thought of her the way poets think of the moon and the stars-in ridiculous hyperbole. He actually saw her surrounded by a sort of silvery halo. Which was completely silly, but if he wanted to think of her that way-well, Hannah wouldn\u0027t object. It made her want to be very gentle with him. And right now she could feel his warm breath. If she leaned forward just an inch her top lip would touch his bottom lip. Hannah leaned forward. \"Wait-\" he said. That was a mistake, saying it out loud. It moved his lips against hers, turning it from a touch into a kiss. And then, for a while, neither of them could resist. They needed each other so desperately, and the kiss was warm and sweet. Hannah was flooded with love and comfort and joy. This was meant to be. Hannah was dizzy but still capable of thought. I knew life had something wonderful and mysterious to give me. Something I could sense but not see, something that was always just out of reach. And here it is. I\u0027m one of the lucky ones-I\u0027ve found it. Thierry wasn\u0027t as articulate. All she could hear him think was, Yes. Hannah had never been so filled with gratitude. Love spilled from her and into Thierry and back again. The more she gave, the more she got back. It was a cycle, taking them higher and higher. Like flying, Hannah thought. She wasn\u0027t dizzy anymore. She was strangely dear and calm, as if she were standing on a mountaintop. Infinite tenderness ... infinite belonging. It was so good it hurt. And it made her want to give more. She knew what she wanted. It was what she\u0027d tried to give him the first time, when she knew he would die without her. She\u0027d wanted to give him what all women could give. Life. She was only a girl now, not ready for the responsibilities that would come with making new life from her body. But she could give Thierry life another way. She pulled back to look at him, to see bruised dark eyes filled with aching tenderness. Then she touched his mouth with her fingertips. He kissed them. Hannah ignored the kiss and poked a finger in. Shock flared in Thierry\u0027s eyes. There. That was it. The long canine tooth, just barely sharp. Not yet the tooth of a predator, of a fox or a lynx or wolf. She ran her finger against it. The shock turned to something else. A glazed look. Need mixed with pure terror. Thierry whispered, \"Don\u0027t-Hannah, please. You don\u0027t know-\" Hannah tested the tip of the tooth with her thumb. Yes, it was sharper now. Longer, more delicate. It would look like the tooth of an arctic fox in her palm-milky-white, translucent, elegantly curved. Thierry\u0027s chest was heaving. \"Please stop. I-I can\u0027t-\" Hannah was enthralled. I don\u0027t know why people are afraid of vampires, she thought. A human could tease or torture a vampire this way, driving him insane-if she were cruel. Or she could choose to be kind. Very gently, Hannah reached with her other hand. She touched the back of Thierry\u0027s neck, bringing just the slightest pressure to bear. But he was so obedient to her touch-it was easy to guide his mouth to her throat. Hannah... She could feel him trembling. Don\u0027t be afraid, she told him silently. And she pulled him closer. He grabbed her shoulders to push her away-and then just hung on. Clinging desperately, helplessly. Kissing her neck over and over. She felt his control break... and then felt the sharpness of teeth. It wasn\u0027t like pain. It was like the tenderness, a hurting that was good. And then... devastating bliss. Not a physical feeling. It was emotional. They were completely together, and light poured through them. How many lives together have we missed? How many times have I had to say, Maybe in the next life? How did we ever manage to come apart? It was as if her question went searching through both their minds, soaring and diving, looking for an answer on its own. And Thierry didn\u0027t put up any resistance. She knew that he couldn\u0027t; he was as caught up as she was in what was happening between them, as overwhelmed. There was nothing to stop her from finding the answer. This revelation didn\u0027t come all in one blinding illumination. Instead it came in small flashes, each almost too brief to understand. Flash. Thierry\u0027s face above her. Not the gentle face she had seen by the porch. A savage face with an animal light in the eyes. A snarling mouth ... and teeth red with blood. No ... Flash. Pain. Teeth that tore her throat. The feel of her blood spilling warm over her neck. Darkness coming. Oh, God, no... Flash. A different face. A woman with black hair and eyes full of concern. \"Don\u0027t you know? He\u0027s evil. How many times does he have to kill you before you realize that?\" No, no, no, no... But saying no didn\u0027t change anything. It was the truth. She was seeing her own memories-seeing things that had really happened. She knew that. He\u0027d killed her. Hannah, no- It was a cry of anguish. Hannah wrenched herself away. She could see the shock in Thierry\u0027s eyes, she could feel him shaking. \"You really did it,\" she whispered. \"Hannah-\" \"That\u0027s why you woke me up from the hypnosis! You didn\u0027t want me to remember! You knew I\u0027d find out the truth!\" Hannah was beside herself with grief and anger. If she hadn\u0027t trusted him, if everything hadn\u0027t been so perfect, she wouldn\u0027t have felt so betrayed. As it was, it was the greatest betrayal of her life-of all her lives. It had all been a lie-everything she\u0027d just been feeling. The togetherness, the love, the joy ... all false. \"Hannah, that wasn\u0027t the reason....\" \"You\u0027re evil! You\u0027re a killer!\" She told me, Hannah thought. The woman with black hair; she told me the truth. Why didn\u0027t I remember her? Why didn\u0027t I listen this time? She could remember other things now, other things the woman had said. \"He\u0027s unbelievably cunning... he\u0027ll try to trick you. He\u0027ll try to use mind control ...\" Mind control. Influencing her. He\u0027d admitted that. And what she\u0027d been feeling tonight was some sort of trick. He\u0027d managed to play on her emotions ... God, he\u0027d even gotten her to offer him her blood. She\u0027d let him bite her, drink from her like some parasite.... \"I hate you,\" she whispered. She saw how that hurt him; he flinched and looked away, stricken. Then he gripped her shoulders again, his voice soft. \"Hannah, I wanted to explain to you. Please. You don\u0027t understand everything ...\" \"Yes, I do! I do! I remember everything! And I understand what you really are.\" Her voice was as quiet as his, but much more intense. She shrugged her shoulders and shifted backward to get away from him. She didn\u0027t want to feel his hands on her. He looked jolted. Unbelieving. \"You remember . .. everything?\" \"Everything.\" Hannah was proud and cold now. \"So you can just go away, because whatever you\u0027ve got planned won\u0027t work. Whatever-tricks-you were going to use...\" She shook her head. \"Just go.\" For just a second, a strange expression crossed Thierry\u0027s face. An expression so tragic and lonely that Hannah\u0027s throat closed. But she couldn\u0027t let herself soften. She couldn\u0027t give him a chance to trick her again. \"Just stay away from me,\" she said. With all the confusion and turmoil inside her, that was the only thing she could keep clear in her mind. \"I never want to see you again.\" He had gotten control of himself. He looked shell-shocked but his eyes were steady. \"I\u0027ve never wanted to hurt you,\" he said quietly. \"And all I want to do now is protect you. But if that\u0027s what you want, I\u0027ll go away.\" How could he claim he\u0027d never wanted to hurt her? Didn\u0027t killing her count? \"That is what I want. And I don\u0027t need your protection.\" \"You have it anyway,\" he said. And then he moved, faster than she could ever hope to move, almost faster than thought. In an instant, he was close to her. His fingers touched her left cheek, light as a moth\u0027s wings. And then he was taking her hand, slipping something on her finger. \"Wear this,\" he said, no louder than a breath. \"It has spells to protect you. And even without the spells, there aren\u0027t many Night People who\u0027ll harm you if they see it.\" Hannah opened her mouth to say she wasn\u0027t afraid of any Night People except him, but he was still speaking. \"Try not to go out alone, especially at night.\" And then he was gone. Like that. He was off her porch and out somewhere in the darkness, not even a shadow, just gone. If she hadn\u0027t had a fleeting impression of movement toward the prairie, she would have thought he had the ability to become invisible at a moment\u0027s notice. And her heart was pounding, hurting, filling her throat so she couldn\u0027t breathe. Why had he touched her cheek? Most people didn\u0027t touch the birthmark; they treated it like a bruise that might still hurt. But his fingers hadn\u0027t avoided it. The caress had been gentle, almost sad, but not frightened. And why was she still standing here, staring into the darkness as if she expected him to reappear? Go inside, idiot. Hannah turned and fumbled with the back door, pulling at the knob as if she\u0027d never opened it before. She shut the door and locked it, and again she found\u0027 herself as clumsy as if she\u0027d never worked a lock or seen this one in her life. She was beyond screaming or crying, in a state of shock that was almost dreamlike. The house was too bright. The dock on the kitchen wall was too loud. She had the distracted feeling that it wasn\u0027t either night or daytime. It was like coming out of a theater and being surprised to find that it\u0027s still light outside. She felt that this couldn\u0027t be the same house she\u0027d left an hour ago. She wasn\u0027t the same person who had left. Everything around her seemed like some carefully staged movie set that was supposed to be real, but wasn\u0027t, and only she could tell the difference. I feel like a stranger here, she thought, putting one hand to her neck where she could just detect two little puncture marks. Oh, God, how am I ever going to know what\u0027s real again? But I should be happy; I should be grateful. I probably just saved my own life out there. I was alone with a vicious, evil, murderous monster, and... Somehow the thought died away. She couldn\u0027t be happy and she didn\u0027t want to think about how evil Thierry was. She felt hollow and aching. It wasn\u0027t until she stumbled into her own bedroom that she remembered to look down at her right hand. On the fourth finger was a ring. It was made of gold and either white gold or silver. It was shaped like a rose, with the stem twining around the finger and back on itself in an intricate knot. The blossom was inset with tiny stones-black transparent stones. Black diamonds? Hannah wondered. It was beautiful. The craftsmanship was exquisite. Every delicate leaf and tiny thorn was perfect. But a black flower? It\u0027s a symbol of the Night World, her mind told her. A symbol of people who\u0027ve been made into vampires. It was the cool wind voice back again. At least she understood what it was saying this time-the last time, when it had given her advice about silver and wolves, she had been completely confused. Thierry wanted her to wear the ring; he claimed it would protect her. But knowing him, it was probably another trick. If it had any spells on it, they were probably spells to help him control her mind. It took nearly an hour to get the ring off. Hannah used soap and butter and Vaseline, pulling and twisting until her finger was red, aching, and swollen. She used a dental pick from her fossil-collecting kit to try to pry the coils of the stem apart. Nothing worked, until at last the pick slipped and blood welled up from a shallow cut. When the blood touched the ring it seemed to loosen, and Hannah quickly wrenched it off. Then she stood panting. The struggle with the little band of metal had left her exhausted and unable to focus on anything else. She threw the ring in her bedroom wastebasket and stumbled toward bed. I\u0027m tired... I\u0027m so tired. I\u0027ll think about everything tomorrow, try to sort out my life. But for now... please just let me sleep. She could feel her body vibrating with adrenaline after she lay in bed, and she was afraid that sleep wouldn\u0027t come. But tense as she was, her mind was too foggy to stay awake. She turned over once and let go of consciousness. Hannah Snow fell asleep. Hana of the Three Rivers opened her eyes. Cold and desolate, Hana stood by the rushing river and felt the wind blow through her. So alone. That was when Arno burst out of the bushes on the riverbank. There were several hunters with him and they all had spears. They charged after the stranger at full speed. Hana screamed a warning, but she knew he didn\u0027t have a chance. She could hear a few minutes of chaos far away in the dark. And then she saw the stranger being driven back, surrounded by Arno\u0027s hunters. \"Arno-don\u0027t hurt him! Please!\" Hana was speaking desperately, trying to block the men\u0027s way back. \"Don\u0027t you see? He could have hurt me and he didn\u0027t. He isn\u0027t a demon! He can\u0027t help being the way he is!\" Arno shouldered her aside. \"Don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to get away without being punished, either.\" Hana followed them up to the cave, her stomach churning with fear. By the time everyone who\u0027d been awakened by Arno\u0027s hunters understood what was happening, the sky outside had turned gray. It was almost dawn. \"You said we should wait and see if the Earth Goddess would tell you something about the demon while you slept,\" Arno said to Old Mother. \"Has she?\" Old Mother glanced at Hana sorrowfully, then back at Arno. She shook her head. Then she started to speak, but Arno was already talking loudly. \"Then let\u0027s kill him and get it over with. Take him outside.\" \"No!\" Hana screamed. It didn\u0027t do any good. She was caught and held back in strong hands. The stranger gave her one look as he was driven outside in a circle of spears. That was when the real horror began. Because of something that Hana had never imagined, something she was sure even the shamans had never heard of. The stranger was a creature that wouldn\u0027t die. Arno was the first to jab with his spear. The whitish-gray flint spearhead went into the stranger\u0027s side, drawing blood. Hana saw it; she had run out of the cave, still trying to find a way to stop this. She also saw the blood stop flowing as the wound in the boy\u0027s side closed. There were gasps from all around her. Arno, looking as if he couldn\u0027t believe his eyes, jabbed again. And watched, mouth falling open, as the second wound bled and then closed. He kept trying. Only the wounds where a spear was driven into the wooden shaft stayed open. One of the women whispered, \"He is a demon.\" Everyone was frightened. But nobody moved away from \"the stranger. He was too dangerous to let go. And there were lots of them, and only one of him. Hana saw something happening in the faces of her clan. Something new and horrible. Fear of the unknown was changing them, making them cruel. They were turning from basically good people, people who would never torture an animal by prolonging its death, into people who would torture a man. \"He may be a demon, but he still bleeds,\" one of the hunters said breathlessly, after a jab. \"He feels pain.\", \"Get a torch,\" somebody else said. \"See if he burns!\" And then it was terrible. Hana felt as if she were in the middle of a storm, able to see things but buffeted this way and that, unable to do anything about it. People were running. People were getting torches, stone axes, different kinds of flint knives. The dam had turned into a huge entity feeding off its own violence. It was mindless and unstoppable. Hana cast a desperate look toward the cave, where Old Mother lay confined to her pallet. There was no help from that direction. People were screaming, burning the stranger, throwing stones at him. The stranger was falling, bloody, smoke rising from his burns. He was lying on the ground, unable to fight back. But still, he didn\u0027t die. He kept trying to crawl away. Hana was screaming herself, screaming and crying, beating at the shoulders of a hunter who pulled her back. And it went on and on. Even the young boys were brave enough now to run forward and throw stones at the stranger. And he still wouldn\u0027t die. Hana was in a nightmare. Her throat was raw from screaming. Her vision was going gray. She couldn\u0027t stand to watch this anymore; she couldn\u0027t stand the smell of blood and burning flesh or the sound of blows. But there was nowhere to go. There was no way to get out. This was her life. She had to stay here and go insane....","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-7.html","bookId":2080,"book":{"id":2080,"title":"Night World : Soulmate (Night World #6)","description":"Storyline: Soulmate (Night World Book 6) Hannah Snow\u0027s life was perfect...until the notes started appearing.
