Through a gap in her curtains she could see the\n gray light of dawn-just like Hana\u0027s gray dawn-and she thought she still might be in the nightmare. But\n then, slowly, objects in the room became clear. Her bookshelves, crammed with books and crowned\n with one near-perfect trilobite fossil on a stand. Her dresser, its top piled with things that belonged in\n other places. Her posters of Velociraptor and T. Rex.\n I\u0027m me. I remember me.\n She had never been so happy to be herself, or to be awake.\n But that dream she\u0027d just had-that had happened to her. A long time ago, sure, but nothing like so long\n ago as, say, when the T. Rex had been alive. Not to mention the trilobite. A few thousand years was\n yesterday to Mother Earth.\n And it was all real, she knew that now. She accepted it. She had fallen asleep and her subconscious had\n pulled back the veil of the past and allowed her to see more of Hana\u0027s story.\n Thierry, she thought. The people of Hana\u0027s clan tortured him. God knows for how long-I\u0027m just glad I\n didn\u0027t have to watch more.\n But it puts sort of a different twist on things, doesn\u0027t it?\n She still didn\u0027t know how the story ended. She wasn\u0027t sure she wanted to know. But it was hard to\n blame him for whatever had happened afterward.\n An awful feeling was settling in Hannah\u0027s stomach. All those things I said to him-terrible things, she\n thought. Why did I say all that? I was so angry-I lost control completely. I hated him and all I cared\n about was hurting him. I really thought he must be evil, pure evil.\n I told him to go away forever. How could I have done that? He\u0027s my soulmate. There was a strange\n emptiness inside her, as if she\u0027d been hollowed out like a tree struck by lightning.\n Inside the emptiness, a voice like a cool dark wind whispered, But you told Paul that he kept killing you\n over and over. Is that justifiable? He\u0027s a vampire, a predator, and that makes him evil by nature. Maybe\n he can\u0027t help being what he is, but there\u0027s no reason for you to be destroyed again because of it. Are you\n going to let him kill you in this life, too?\n She was torn between pity for him and the deep instinct that he was dangerous. The cool wind voice\n seemed to be the voice of reason.\n Go ahead and feel sorry for him, it said. Just keep him far away from you.\n She felt better having come to a decision, even if it was a decision that left her heart numb. She glanced\n around the room, focused on the clock by her bedside, and blinked.\n Oh, my God-school.\n It was quarter to seven and it was a Friday. Sacaja-wea High seemed light-years away, like someplace\n she\u0027d visited in a past life.\n But it\u0027s not. It\u0027s your life, now, the only one that counts. You have to forget all that other stuff about\n reincarnation and vampires and the Night World. You have to forget about him.\n You sent him away and he\u0027s gone. So let\u0027s get on with living in the normal world.\n Just thinking this way made her feel braced and icy, as if she\u0027d had a cold shower. She took a real\n shower, dressed in jeans and a denim shirt, and she had breakfast with her mother, who cast her several\n thoughtful glances but didn\u0027t ask any questions until they were almost finished.\n Then she said, \"Did everything go all right at Dr. Winfield\u0027s yesterday evening?\"\n Had it only been yesterday evening? It seemed like a week ago. Hannah chewed a bite of cornflakes\n and finally said, \"Uh, why?\"\n \"Because he called while you were in the shower. He seemed...\" Her mother stopped and searched\n for a word. \"Anxious. Worse than worried but not as bad as hysterical.\"\n Hannah looked at her mother\u0027s face, which was narrow, intelligent, and tanned by the Montana sun.\n Her eyes were more blue than Hannah\u0027s gray, but they were direct and discerning.\n She wanted to tell her mother the whole story- but when she had time to do it, and after she\u0027d had . time\n to think it out. There was no urgency. It was all behind her now, and it wasn\u0027t as if she needed advice.\n \"Paul\u0027s anxious a lot,\" she said judiciously, sticking to the clean edge of truth. \"I think that\u0027s why he\n became a psychologist. He tried a sort of hypnosis thing on me yesterday and it didn\u0027t exactly work out.\"\n \"Hypnosis?\" Her mother\u0027s eyebrows lifted. \"Hannah, I don\u0027t know if you should be getting into that-\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry; I\u0027m not. It\u0027s over. We\u0027re not going to try it again.\"\n \"I see. Well, he said for you to call him to set up another appointment. I think he wants to see you soon.\"\n She reached over suddenly and took Hannah\u0027s hand. \"Honey, are you feeling any better? Are you still\n having bad dreams?\"\n Hannah looked away. \"Actually-I sort of had one last night. But I think I understand them better now.\n They don\u0027t scare me as much.\" She squeezed her mother\u0027s hand. \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m going to be fine.\"\n \"All right, but-\" Before her mother could finish the sentence a horn honked outside.\n \"That\u0027s Chess. I\u0027d better run.\" Hannah gulped down the dregs of her orange juice and dashed into her\n bedroom to grab her backpack. She hesitated a split second by the wastebasket, then shook her head.\n No. There was no reason to take the black rose ring with her. It was his, and she didn\u0027t want to be\n reminded of him.\n She slung the backpack over her shoulder, yelled goodbye to her mother, and hurried outside.\n Chess\u0027s car was parked in the driveway. As Hannah started toward it she had an odd impression. She\n seemed to see a figure standing behind the car-a tall figure, face turned toward her. But her eyes were\n dazzled by the sun and at that instant she involuntarily blinked. When she could see again, there was\n nothing in that spot except a little swirl of dust.\n \"You\u0027re late,\" Chess said when Hannah got in the car. Chess, whose real name was Catherine Clovis,\n was petite and pretty, with dark hair cut in a cap to frame her face. But just now her slanted green cat\n eyes and Mona Lisa smile reminded Hannah too much of Ket. It was disconcerting; she had to glance\n down to make sure Chess wasn\u0027t wearing a deerskin outfit.\n \"You okay?\" Now Chess was looking at her with concern.\n \"Yeah.\" Hannah sank back against the upholstery, blinking. \"I think I need to get my eyes checked,\n though.\" She glanced at the spot where the phantom figure had been-nothing. And Chess was just Chess:\n smart, savvy, and faintly exotic, like an orchid blooming in the badlands.\n \"Well, you can do it when we go shopping this weekend,\" Chess said. She slanted Hannah a glance.\n \"We must go shopping. Next week\u0027s your birthday and I need something new to wear.\"\n Hannah grinned in spite of herself. \"Maybe a new necklace,\" she muttered.\n \"What?\"\n \"Nothing.\" I wonder what happened to Ket, she thought. Even if Hana died young, at least Ket must\n have grown up. I wonder if she married Ran, the guy who wanted to \"mate\" her?\n \"Are you sure you\u0027re okay?\" Chess said.\n \"Yeah. Sorry; I\u0027m a little brain-dead. I didn\u0027t sleep well last night.\" Her plan for Chess was exactly the\n same as for her mother. Tell her everything-in a little while. When she was less upset about it.\n Chess was putting an arm around her, steering skillfully with the other. \"Hey, we\u0027ve got to get you in\n shape, kid. I mean, first it\u0027s your birthday, then graduation. Isn\u0027t that psychologist doing anything to help?\"\n Hannah muttered, \"Maybe too much.\"\n That night, she was restless again. The school day had passed uneventfully. Hannah and her mother had\n had dinner peacefully. But after her mother went out to a meeting with some local rockhounds, Hannah\n found herself wandering around the house, too wound up to read or watch TV, too distracted to go\n anywhere.\n Maybe I need some air, she thought-and then she caught herself and gave a self-mocking grin.\n Sure. Air. When what you\u0027re really thinking is that he just might be out there. Admit it.\n She admitted it. Not that she thought Thierry was very likely to be hanging around her backyard,\n considering what she\u0027d said to him.\n And why should you want to talk to him? she demanded of herself. He may not be completely and\n totally and pointlessly evil, but he\u0027s still no boy scout.\n But she couldn\u0027t shake a vague feeling of wanting\n to go outside. At last she went out on the porch, telling herself that she\u0027d spend five minutes here and\n then go back inside.\n It was another beautiful night, but Hannah couldn\u0027t enjoy it. Everything reminded her too much of him.\n She could feel herself softening toward him, weakening. He had looked so stricken, so devastated, when\n she told him to go away....\n \"Am I interrupting?\"\n Hannah started. She wheeled toward the voice.\n Standing on the other side of the porch was a tall girl. She looked a year or so older than Hannah, and\n she had long hair, very long hair, so black that it seemed to reflect moonlight like a raven\u0027s wing. She was\n extraordinarily beautiful-and Hannah recognized her.\n She\u0027s the one from my vision. That flash of a girl telling me that Thierry was cunning. She\u0027s the one who\n warned me about him.\n And she\u0027s the figure I saw behind Chess\u0027s car this morning. She must have been watching me then.\n \"I\u0027m sorry if I scared you,\" the girl said now, smiling. \"You looked so far away, and I didn\u0027t mean to\n startle you. But I\u0027d really like to talk to you if you have a few minutes.\"\n \"I...\" Hannah felt strangely tongue-tied. Something about the girl made her uncomfortable, in a way that\n went beyond the dreamlike weirdness of recognizing somebody she\u0027d never seen in her present life.\n But she\u0027s your friend, she told herself. She\u0027s helped you in the past; she probably wants to help you again\n now. You should be grateful to her.\n \"Sure,\" Hannah said. \"We can talk.\" She added somewhat awkwardly, \"I remember you.\"\n \"Wonderful. Do you really? That makes everything so much easier.\"\n Hannah nodded. And told herself again that this girl was her friend, and nobody to be hostile to or wary\n of.\n \"Well...\" The girl glanced around the porch, where there was dearly no place to sit. \"Ah...\"\n Hannah was embarrassed, as if the girl had asked, \"Do you entertain all your visitors outside?\" She\n turned around and opened the back door. \"Come on in. We can sit down.\" \"Thank you,\" the girl said and\n smiled. In the bright fluorescent lights of the kitchen, she was even more beautiful. Hauntingly beautiful.\n Exquisite features, skin like silk. Lips that made Hannah think of adjectives like full and ripe. And eyes\n that were like nothing Hannah had ever seen before.\n They were large, almond-shaped, heavy-lashed, and luminous. But it wasn\u0027t just that. Every time Hannah\n looked, they seemed to be a different color. They changed from honey to mahogany to jungle-leaf green\n to larkspur purple to misty blue. It was amazing.\n \"If you remember me, then you must know what I\u0027m here about,\" the girl said. She rested an elbow on\n the kitchen table and propped her chin on her fist. Hannah said one word. \"Thierry.\" \"Yes, From the way\n you say that, maybe you don\u0027t need my advice after all.\" The girl had an extraordinary voice as well; low\n and pleasant, with a faint husky throb in it. Hannah lifted her shoulders. \"Well, there\u0027s still a lot I don\u0027t\n know about him-but I don\u0027t need anybody to tell me that he\u0027s dangerous. And I\u0027ve already told him to go\n away.\"\n \"Have you really? How remarkably brave of you.\"\n Hannah blinked. She hadn\u0027t thought of it as being so brave.\n \"I mean, you do realize how powerful he is? He\u0027s a Lord of the Night World, the head of all the made\n vampires. He could\"-the girl snapped her fingers- \"call out a hundred little vampires and werewolves. Not\n to mention his connection with the witches in Las Vegas.\"\n \"What are you trying to say? That I shouldn\u0027t have told him to go away? I don\u0027t care how many monsters\n he can call out,\" Hannah said sharply.\n \"No. Of course you don\u0027t. Like I said, you\u0027re brave.\" The girl regarded her with eyes the deep purple of\n bittersweet nightshade. \"I just want you to realize what he\u0027s capable of. He could have this whole county\n wiped out. He can be very cruel and very childish-if he doesn\u0027t get what he wants he\u0027ll simply go into a\n rage.\"\n \"And does he do that a lot-go into rages?\"\n \"All the time, unfortunately.\"\n I don\u0027t believe you.\n The thought came to Hannah suddenly. She didn\u0027t know where it came from, but she couldn\u0027t ignore it.\n There was something about this girl that bothered her, something that felt like a greasy stone held\n between the fingers. That felt like a lie.\n \"Who are you?\" she said directly. When the girl\u0027s eyes-now burnt sienna-lifted to hers this time, she held\n them. \"I mean, why are you so interested in\n me? Why are you even here, in Montana, where I am? Is it just a coincidence?\"\n \"Of course not. I came because I knew that he was about to find you again. I\u0027m interested in you*\n because-well, I\u0027ve known Thierry since his childhood, before he became a vampire, and I feel a certain\n obligation to stop him.\" She smiled, meeting Hannah\u0027s steady gaze easily. \"And my name ... is Maya.\"\n She said the last words slowly, and she seemed to be watching Hannah for a reaction. But the name\n didn\u0027t mean anything to Hannah. And Hannah simply couldn\u0027t figure out whether this girl called Maya was\n lying or not.\n \"I know you\u0027ve warned me about Thierry before,\" she said, trying to gather her thoughts. \"But I don\u0027t\n remember anything about it except you telling me. I don\u0027t even know what you are-I mean, are you\n somebody who\u0027s been reincarnated like me? Or are you... ?\" She left the question open-ended. As a\n matter of fact, she knew Maya wasn\u0027t human; no human was so eerily beautiful or supernaturally graceful.\n If Maya claimed she was, Hannah would know for sure it was a deception.\n \"I\u0027m a vampire,\" Maya said calmly and without hesitation. \"I lived with Thierry\u0027s tribe in the days when\n you lived with the Three Rivers clan. In fact, I\u0027m the one who actually made him into a vampire. I\n shouldn\u0027t have done it; I should have realized he was one of those people who couldn\u0027t handle it. But I\n didn\u0027t know he\u0027d go crazy and become... what he is.\" She looked off into the distance. \"I suppose that\u0027s\n why I feel responsible for him,\" she finished\n softly. Then she looked back at Hannah. \"Any other questions?\"\n \"Hundreds,\" Hannah said. \"About the Night World, and about what\u0027s happened to me in past lives-\"\n \"And I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not going to be able to answer most of them. There are rules against talking about\n the Night World-and anyway, it\u0027s safer for you not to know. As for your past lives, well, you don\u0027t really\n want to know what he\u0027s done to you each time, do you? It\u0027s too gruesome.\" She leaned forward, looking\n at Hannah earnestly. \"What you should do now is put the past behind you and forget about all this. Try to\n have a happy future.\"\n It was exactly what Hannah had decided to do earlier. So why did she feel like bristling now? She\n weighed different responses and finally said, \"If he wants to kill me so much, why didn\u0027t he just do it last\n night? Instead of talking to me.\"\n \"Oh, my dear child.\" The tone was slightly patronizing, but seemed genuinely pitying. \"He wants you to\n love him first, and then he kills you. I know, it\u0027s sick, it\u0027s twisted, but it\u0027s the way he is. He seems to think\n it has to be that way, since it was that way the first time. He\u0027s obsessed.\"\n Hannah was silent. Nothing inside her stood up to say that this was a lie. And the idea that Thierry was\n obsessed certainly rang true. At last she said slowly, \"Thank you for coming to warn me. I do appreciate\n it.\"\n \"No, you don\u0027t,\" Maya said. \"I wouldn\u0027t either if someone came to tell me things I didn\u0027t want to hear.\n But maybe someday you will thank me.\" She stood. \"I hope we won\u0027t have to meet again.\"\n Hannah walked her to the back door and let her out.\n On the porch, Maya turned. \"He really is insane, you know!\" she said. \"You\u0027ll probably begin to have,\n doubts again. But he\u0027s obsessive and unstable, just like any stalker; and he\u0027s really capable of anything.\n Don\u0027t be fooled.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ever going to see him again,\" Hannah said, unreasonably annoyed. \"So it\u0027s going to be\n kind of hard to fool me.\"\n Maya smiled, nodded, then did the disappearing act. Just as Thierry had, she turned and simply melted\n into the night.\n Hannah stared out into the darkness for a minute or so. Then she went back into the kitchen and called\n Paul Winfield\u0027s number.\n She got his answering machine. \"Hi, this is Hannah, and I got your message about making another\n appointment. I was wondering if we could maybe do it tomorrow-or anyway some time over the\n weekend. And...\" She hesitated, wondering if it was something she should say in person, then\n shrugged. Might as well give him time to prepare. \"And I\u0027d like to do another regression. There are some\n things I want to figure out.\"\n She felt better after she hung up. One way or another, she would get at the truth.\n She headed into her bedroom with a faint, grim smile.\n And stopped dead on the threshold.\n Thierry was sitting on her bed.\n For a moment Hannah stood frozen. Then she said sharply, \"What are you doing here?\" At the same\n time, she glanced around the room to see how he\n had gotten in. The windows were shut and only opened from inside.\n He must have walked in while I was in the kitchen talking with Maya.\n \"I had to see you,\" Thierry said. He looked- strange. His dark eyes seemed hot somehow, as if he were\n burning inside. His face was tense and grim.\n \"I told you to keep away from me.\" Hannah kept fear out of her voice-but she was scared. There was a\n sort of electricity in the air, but it wasn\u0027t a good electricity. It was purely dangerous.\n \"I know you did, and I tried. But I can\u0027t stay away, Hannah. I just can\u0027t. It makes me ... crazy.\"\n And with that, he stood up.\n Hannah\u0027s heart seemed to jump into her throat and stay there, pounding hard. She fought to keep her\n face calm.\n He\u0027s fast, a little voice in her head seemed to say, and with relief she recognized the dark wind voice, the\n cool voice of reason. There\u0027s no point in running from him, because he can catch you in a second.\n \"You have to understand,\" Thierry was saying. \"Please try to understand. I need you. We were meant to\n be together. Without you, I\u0027m nothing.\"\n He took a step toward her. His eyes were black and fathomless, and Hannah could almost feel their\n heat. Obsessed, yes, she thought. Maya was right. He may jut on a good front, but underneath he\u0027s just\n plain crazy. like any stalker.\n \"Say you understand,\" Thierry said. He reached a pleading hand toward her.\n \"I understand,\" Hannah said grimly. \"And I still want you to go away.\"\n \"I can\u0027t. I have to make sure we\u0027ll be together, the way we were meant to be. And there\u0027s only one way\n to do that.\"\n There was something different about his mouth, Two delicate fangs were protruding, indenting .his lower\n Hannah felt a cold fist dose over her heart.\n \"You have to join the Night World, Hannah. You have to become like me. I promise you, once it\u0027s over,\n you\u0027ll be happy.\"\n \"Happy?\" A wave of sickening revulsion swept over Hannah. \"As a monster like you? I was happy\n before you ever showed up. I\u0027d be happy if you\u0027d just keep out of my life forever. I-\"\n Stop talking! The cool wind voice was screaming at her, but Hannah was too overwrought to listen.\n \"You\u0027re disgusting. I hate you. And nothing can j ever make me love you ag-\"\n She didn\u0027t get to finish. In one swift movement, he was in front of her. And then he grabbed her.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-8.html","bookId":2080,"book":{"id":2080,"title":"Night World : Soulmate (Night World #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Soulmate (Night World Book 6) \n Hannah Snow\u0027s life was perfect...until the notes started appearing.
