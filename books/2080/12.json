{"id":88814,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"was sixteen and her name was Ha-nahkt. She was a virgin priestess dedicated to the goddess Isis. She was wearing a fine linen shift that fell from her waist to her ankles. Above the waist, she wore nothing except a deep silver collar strung with beads of amethyst, carnelian, turquoise, and lapis lazuli. There were two silver bracelets on her upper arms and two on her wrists. Morning was her favorite time. This morning she carefully placed her offering in front of the statue of Isis. Lotus blossoms, small cakes, and beer. Then, facing south, she began the chant to wake the goddess up. \"Awaken, Isis, Mother of the Stars, Great of Magic, Mistress of all the World, Sovereign of her father, Mightier than the gods, Lady of the Waters of Life, Powerful of Heart, Isis of the Ten Thousand Names ...\" A step sounded behind her and she broke off short, feeling startled and annoyed. \"I\u0027m sorry. Did I disturb you?\" It was a woman, a beautiful woman with long black hair. \"You\u0027re not allowed in here,\" Ha-nahkt said sharply. \"Only priests and priestesses...\" Her voice trailed off as she looked at the woman more closely. Maybe she is a priestess, she thought. There\u0027s something in her face.... \"I just want to talk to you,\" the woman said. Her voice was husky and persuasive, almost mesmerizing. \"It\u0027s very important.\" She smiled and Ha-nahkt felt hairs stir at the back of her neck. If she\u0027s a priestess, I bet she\u0027s a priestess of Set. Set was the most evil of all the gods-and one of the most powerful. Ha-nahkt could sense power in this woman, no question about that. But evil? She wasn\u0027t sure. \"My name is Maya. And what I have to tell you may save your life.\" Ha-nahkt stood still. Part of her wanted to run from Maya, to go and get her best friend Khet-hetep-\"es. Or, better yet, one of the senior priestesses. But another part of her was curious. \"I really shouldn\u0027t stop in the middle of the chant,\" she began. \"It\u0027s about the stranger.\" Ha-nahkt lost her breath. There was a long moment of silence, and then she said, \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" She could hear the shake in her own voice. \"Oh, yes, you do. The stranger. Tall, blond, handsome... and with such sad dark eyes. The one you\u0027ve been meeting on the sly.\" Ha-nahkt could feel the shaking take over her whole body. She was a priestess, sworn to the goddess. If anyone found she\u0027d been meeting a man. ... \"Oh, don\u0027t worry, little one,\" Maya said and laughed. \"I\u0027m not here to turn you in. Just the opposite, in fact. I want to help you.\" \"We haven\u0027t done anything,\" Ha-nahkt faltered. \"Just kissed. He says he doesn\u0027t want me to leave the temple. He isn\u0027t going to stay long. He says he saw me, and he just had to speak to me.\" \"And no wonder,\" Maya said in a cooing tone. She touched Ha-nahkt\u0027s hair lightly and Ha-nahkt moved instinctively away. \"You\u0027re such a pretty girl. Such unusual coloring for this part of the world. I suppose you think you love him.\" \"I do love him,\" Ha-nahkt blurted before she could stop herself. Then she lowered her voice. \"But I know my duty. He says that in the next world we\u0027ll be together.\" She didn\u0027t want to tell the rest of it, the remarkable things she\u0027d seen with the stranger, the way she\u0027d recognized him. The way they were destined for each other. \"And you believed him? Oh, my dear child. You\u0027re so innocent. I suppose that comes from living your life in a temple.\" She gazed around thoughtfully, then looked back at Hannah. Her face became grave and regretful. \"I hate to have to tell you this,\" she said. \"But the stranger does not love you. The truth is that he\u0027s a very evil man. The truth is that he\u0027s not a man at all. He\u0027s an Ur-Demon and he wants to steal your sa.\" Oh, Isis, Ha-nahkt thought. Sa was the breath of life, the magical force that allowed you to live. She\u0027d heard of demons who wanted to steal it. But she couldn\u0027t believe it of the stranger. He seemed so gentle, so kind... \"It\u0027s true,\" Maya said positively. She glanced at Ha-nahkt sideways. \"And you know it is, if you think about it. Why else would he want to taste your blood?\" Ha-nahkt started and flushed. \"How do you know-?\" She stopped and bit her lip. \"You\u0027ve been meeting him at night by the lotus pool, when everyone else is asleep,\" Maya said. \"And I suppose you thought it wouldn\u0027t hurt to let him drink a little of your blood. Not much. Just a bit. It was exciting. But I\u0027m telling you the truth, now-it will hurt you. He\u0027s a demon and he wants you dead.\" The husky, mesmerizing voice went on and on. It was telling all about Ur-Demons who drank blood, and men and women who could change into animals, and a place called the World of the Night, where they all lived. Ha-nahkt\u0027s head began to spin. And her heart shattered. Literally. She could feel the jagged pieces of it every time she tried to breathe. A priestess didn\u0027t cry, but tears were forcing themselves out of her closed lids. Because she couldn\u0027t deny that the stranger did act a little like an Ur-Demon. Why else would he drink blood? And the things she\u0027d seen with him, the feeling of destiny... that must have all been magic. He had tricked her with spells. Maya seemed to have finished her story. \"Do you think you can remember all that?\" she asked. Ha-nahkt made a miserable gesture. What did it matter if she remembered it? She only wanted to be left \"Look at me!\" Ha-nahkt glanced up, startled. It was a mistake. Maya\u0027s eyes were strange; they seemed to turn different colors from moment to moment, and once Ha-nahkt met them, she couldn\u0027t look away. She was caught in a spell, and she felt her will slipping. \"Now,\" Maya said, and her eyes were deep gold and ancient as a crocodile\u0027s. \"Remember all that. And remember this. Remember... how he kills you.\" And then the strangest thing of all happened. It suddenly seemed to Ha-nahkt that she was two people. One of them was her ordinary self. And the other was a different self, a distant self, who seemed to be looking on from the future. At this moment, Ha-nahkt and the future self were seeing different things. Ha-nahkt saw that Maya was gone and the temple was empty. And then she saw that someone else was walking in. A tall figure, with light hair and dark fathomless eyes-the stranger. He smiled at her, walked toward her with his arms held out. He grasped her with hands that were as strong as a demon\u0027s. Then he showed his teeth. The future self saw something else. She saw that Maya never left the temple. She saw Maya\u0027s face and body ripple as if they were made of water-and then change. It was as if there were two images, one on top of the other. The outward image was of the stranger, but it was Maya underneath. That\u0027s it. That\u0027s how she did it. The voice came from outside Ha-nahkt, and she didn\u0027t understand it. She didn\u0027t have time to think about it, either, because the next instant she felt the tearing pain of teeth. Oh, Isis, Goddess of Life, guide me to the other world.... \"That\u0027s how she did it,\" Hannah breathed. She was sitting up on the couch. She knew who she was, and more, she knew who she\u0027d been. It was another of those blinding flashes of illumination. She felt as if she were standing at the end of the corridor of time and looking back at a hundred different versions of herself. They each looked slightly different, and they wore different clothes, but they were all her. Her name had been Hanje, Anora, Xiana, Nan Haiane, Honni, Ian, Annette. She had been a warrior, a priestess, a princess, a slave. And right now she felt she had the strength of all her selves. At the far end of the corridor, back where it was misty and blurry and faintly tinted pink and blue, she seemed to see Hana smiling at her. And then Hana turned and walked away, her task accomplished. Hannah took a deep breath and let it out. \"She did it with illusions,\" she said, hardly aware that she was talking out loud. \"Maya. And she\u0027s done it before, of course. Maybe every time. What do you do with somebody who keeps killing you over and over? Never letting you live to your seventeenth birthday? Trying to destroy you, not just your life, but your heart... ?\" She realized that Paul was staring at her. \"You want me to answer that?\" Hannah shook her head even as she went on talking. \"Goddess-I mean, God-she must hate me. I still don\u0027t understand why. It must be because she wants Thierry herself-or maybe just because she wants him miserable. She wants him to know that I\u0027m terrified of him, that I hate him. And she did it. She convinced me. She convinced my subconscious enough that I started warning myself against him.\" \"If any of this is true-which I\u0027m not going to admit for a second, because they would definitely take my license away-then I can tell you one thing,\" Paul said. \"She sounds very, very dangerous.\" \"She is.\" \"Then why are you so happy?\" he asked pathetically. Hannah glanced at him and laughed. She couldn\u0027t hope to explain it. But she was more than happy, she was exalted. She was buoyant, ecstatic, over the moon. Thierry wasn\u0027t evil. She had the confirmation of a hundred selves whispering it to her. Maya was the enemy, the snake in the garden. Thierry was exactly what he\u0027d told her he was. Someone who had made a terrible mistake and had spent millennia paying for it-and searching for her. He is gentle and kind. He does love me. And we are destined for each other. I\u0027ve got to find him. The last thought came as an additional bright revelation, but one that made her sit up and go still. She had no idea how. Where had he gone? Home. Where was home? She didn\u0027t know. It could be anywhere in the world. \"Hannah...\" \"Wait,\" Hannah whispered. \"Look, Hannah, I think we should maybe do some work on this. Talk about it, examine your feelings ...\" \"No, hush!\" Hannah waved a hand at him. \"She gave me a clue! She didn\u0027t mean to, but she gave me a clue! She said he had connections with witches in Vegas.\" \"Oh, my God,\" Paul muttered. Then he jumped up. \"Hannah, where are you going?\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" She darted back into the office, threw her arms around him, and gave him a kiss. Then, smiling into his startled face, she said, \"Thank you. Thank you for helping. You\u0027ll never know how much you\u0027ve done for me.\" \"I need money.\" Chess blinked, but went on looking at her intently. \"I know it isn\u0027t fair to ask you without explaining why. But I can\u0027t tell you. It would be dangerous for you. I just have to ask you to trust me.\" Chess kept looking at her. The slanted green eyes searched Hannah\u0027s face. Then, without a word, she got up. Hannah sat on Chess\u0027s crisp white-on-white coverlet and waited. After a few minutes Chess came back into the room and settled her own petite self on the bed. \"Here,\" she said, and plunked down a credit card. \"Mom said I could use it to get some things for graduation. I figure she\u0027ll understand-maybe.\" Hannah threw her arms around her. \"Thank you,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027ll pay it back as soon as I can.\" Then she burst out, \"How can you be so nice? I\u0027d be yelling to know what was going on.\" \"I am going to yell,\" Chess said, squeezing her back. \"But more than that. I\u0027m going with you.\" Hannah drew back. How could she explain? She knew that by going to Las Vegas she would be putting her own life in danger. From Maya, certainly. From the Night World, probably. Even from the witches Thierry had connections with, possibly. And she couldn\u0027t drag Chess into that. \"I\u0027ve got something I want you to hang on to,\" she said. She reached into her canvas bag and pulled out an envelope. \"This is for you and for my mom- just in case. If you don\u0027t hear from me by my birthday, then I want you to open it.\" \"Didn\u0027t you hear me? I\u0027m going with you. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s been going on with you, but I\u0027m not going to let you run off on your own.\" \"And I can\u0027t take you.\" She caught the glowing cat-eyes and held them. \"Please understand, Chess. It\u0027s something I have to do alone. Besides, I need you here to cover for me, to tell my mom I\u0027m at your house so she doesn\u0027t worry. Okay?\" She reached out and gave Chess a tiny shake. \"Okay?\" Chess shut her eyes, then nodded. Then she sniffled, her chin trembling. Hannah hugged her again. \"Thank you,\" she whispered. \"Let\u0027s be best friends forever.\" Monday morning, instead of going to school, Hannah started for Billings airport. She was driving the Ford-her mom had fixed it over the weekend. Her mom thought she was spending the next couple of days with Chess to study for finals. It was frightening but exhilarating to fly on a plane by herself, going to a city she\u0027d never been to before. All the time she was in the air, she was thinking, Closer, closer, closer-and looking at the black rose ring on her finger. She\u0027d fished it out of her bedroom wastebasket. Now she turned her hand this way and that to see the black gems catch the light. Her chest tightened. What if I can\u0027t find him? she thought. The other fear she didn\u0027t want to admit, even to herself. What if she did find him, and he didn\u0027t want her anymore? After all, she\u0027d only told him that she hated him a few dozen times and ordered him to stay away from her forever. I won\u0027t think about that. There\u0027s no point. First I have to track him down, and after that what happens, The airport in Las Vegas was surprisingly small. There were slot machines all over. Hannah collected her one duffel bag at the luggage carousel and then walked outside. She stood in the warm desert air, trying to figure out what to do next. How do you find witches? She didn\u0027t know. She didn\u0027t think they were likely to be listed in the phone book. So she just trusted to luck and headed where everybody else was heading-the Strip. It was a mistake from the beginning, and that afternoon and night were among the worst times in. her life. It didn\u0027t start off so bad. The Strip was gaudy and glittery, especially as darkness fell. The hotels were so bizarre and so dazzling that it took Hannah\u0027s breath away. One of them, the Luxor, was shaped like a giant black pyramid with a Sphinx in front of it. Hannah stood and watched colored lasers dart from the Sphinx\u0027s eyes and laughed. What would Ha-nahkt have thought of that? But there was something almost sickening about all the lights and the hustling after a while. Something . . . unwholesome. The crowds were so thick, both inside the hotels and out on the street, that Hannah could hardly move. Everyone seemed to be in a rush-except the people nailed in front of slot machines. It feels... greedy, Hannah decided finally, searching in her mind for the right word. All these people want to win free money. All these hotels want to take their money. And of course, the hotels are the winners in the end. They\u0027ve built a sort of Venus\u0027 flytrap to lure people here. And some of these people don\u0027t look as if they can afford to lose. Her heart felt physically heavy and her lungs felt constricted. She wanted Montana and a horizon so far away that it pried your mind open. She wanted clean air. She wanted space. But even worse than the atmosphere of greed and commercialism was the fact that she wasn\u0027t finding any witches. She struck up conversations a few times with desk clerks and waitresses. But when she casually asked if there were any odd people in town who practiced witchcraft, they looked at her as if she were crazy. By nine o\u0027clock that night she was dizzy, exhausted, and sick with defeat. I\u0027m never going to find them. Which means I\u0027m never going to find him. She collapsed on a bench outside the Stardust Hotel, wondering what to do next. Her legs hurt and her head was pounding. She didn\u0027t want to spend Chess\u0027s mom\u0027s money on a hotel-but she\u0027d noticed police officers making people move on if they tried to sleep on the street. Why did I come here? I should have put an ad in the paper: \"Desperately Seeking Thierry.\" I should have known this wouldn\u0027t work. Even as she was thinking it, something about a boy in the crowd caught her eye. He wasn\u0027t Thierry. He wasn\u0027t anything like Thierry. Except for the way he moved. It was that same rippling grace she\u0027d seen in both Thierry and Maya, an easy control of motion that reminded her of a jungle cat. And his face ... he was almost eerily good-looking in a ragamuffin way. When he glanced up toward the Stardust\u0027s tall neon sign, she thought she could see light reflect from his He\u0027s one of them. I know it. He\u0027s one of the Night People. Without stopping to think, she jumped up, slung her bag over her shoulder, and followed him. It wasn\u0027t easy. He walked fast and she had to keep dodging tourists. He was headed off the Strip, to one of the quiet dimly-lit streets that ran parallel to it. It was a whole different world here, just one block away from the glitter and bustle. The hotels were, small and in poor repair. The businesses seemed to be mostly pawnshops. Everything had a dingy depressed feeling. Hannah felt a prickling down her spine. She was now following the only figure on a deserted street. Any minute now, he\u0027d realize she was tailing him-but what could she do? She didn\u0027t dare lose sight of him. The boy seemed to be leading her into worse and worse areas-sleazy was the word for them, Hannah thought. The streetlights were far apart here with areas of darkness in between. All at once he took a sharp left turn, seeming to disappear behind a building with a sign that read, Dan\u0027s Bail Bonds. Hannah jogged to catch up to him and found herself staring down a narrow alley. It was extremely dark. She hesitated a moment, then grimly took a few steps forward. On the third step, the boy appeared from behind a Dumpster. He was facing her, and once again Hannah caught the flash of eyeshine. She stood very still as he walked slowly toward her. \"You following me or something?\" he asked. He seemed amused. He had a sharp face with an almost pointed chin and dark hair that looked uncombed. He was no taller than Hannah, but his body seemed tough and wiry. It\u0027s the Artful Dodger, Hannah thought. As he reached her, he looked her up and down. His expression was a combination of lechery and hunger. Gooseflesh blossomed on Hannah\u0027s skin. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said, trying to make her voice quiet and direct. \"I was following you. I wanted to ask you something-I\u0027m looking for someone.\" \"You found him, baby,\" the boy said. He darted a quick glance around as if to make sure that there was nobody in the alley with them. And then, before Hannah could say another word, he knocked her into the wall and pinned her there.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-12.html","bookId":2080,"book":{"id":2080,"title":"Night World : Soulmate (Night World #6)","description":"Storyline: Soulmate (Night World Book 6) Hannah Snow\u0027s life was perfect...until the notes started appearing.
