{"id":88806,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Thierry knelt by the window, careful not to make a noise or disturb the dry earth beneath him. It was a\\n\\n skill so familiar to his body that he might have been born with it. Darkness was his native environment; he\\n\\n could melt into a shadow at an instant\u0027s notice or move more quietly than a stalking cat. But right now he\\n\\n was looking into the light.\\n\\n He could see her. Just the curve of her shoulder and the spill of her hair, but he knew it was her.\\n\\n Beside him, Lupe was crouched, her thin body human but quivering with animal alertness and tension.\\n\\n She whispered, softer than a breath, \"All right?\"\\n\\n Thierry tore his gaze from that shoulder to look at her. Lupe\u0027s face was bruised, one eye almost closed,\\n\\n lower lip torn. But she was smiling. She\u0027d stuck around Medicine Rock until Thierry had arrived, tailing\\n\\n the girl called Hannah Snow, making sure no harm came to her.\\n\\n Thierry took Lupe\u0027s hand and kissed it. You\u0027re an angel, he told her, and made even less sound than she\\n\\n had in speaking because he didn\u0027t use his vocal chords at all. His voice was telepathic. And you deserve\\n\\n a long vacation. My limo\u0027s at the tourist resort in Clearwater; take it to the airport at Billings.\\n\\n \"But-you\u0027re not planning to stay here alone, are you? You need backup, sir. If she comes-\"\\n\\n I can take care of things. I brought something to protect Hannah. Besides she won\u0027t do anything until she\\n\\n talks to me.\\n\\n \"But-\"\\n\\n Lupe, go. His tone was gentle, but it was unmistakably not the urging of a friend anymore. It was the\\n\\n order of her liege lord, Thierry of the Night World, who was accustomed to being obeyed. Funny,\\n\\n Thierry thought, how you never realized how accustomed you were to being obeyed until somebody\\n\\n defied you. Now, he turned away from Lupe and looked through the cracks in the boarded-up window\\n\\n And promptly forgot that Lupe existed. The girl on the couch had turned. He could see her face.\\n\\n Shock coursed through him.\\n\\n He had known it was her-but he hadn\u0027t known that it would look so much like her. Like the way she had\\n\\n looked the first time, the first time she had been born, the first time he had seen her. This was what he\\n\\n thought of as her true face, and though he\u0027d seen various approximations of it through the years, he\u0027d\\n\\n never seen it again. Until now.\\n\\n This was the exact image of the girl he\u0027d fallen in love with.\\n\\n The same long, straight fair hair, like silk in different shades of wheat color, spilling over her shoulders.\\n\\n The same wide gray eyes that seemed full of light. The same steady expression, the same tender mouth,\\n\\n upper lip indenting the lower to give her a look of t unintentional sensuality. The same fine bone structure,\\n\\n the high cheekbones and graceful line of jaw that made her a sculptor\u0027s dream.\\n\\n The only thing that was different was the birthmark.\\n\\n The psychic brand.\\n\\n It was the color of watered wine held up to the light, of watermelon ice, of a pink tourmaline, the palest\\n\\n of gemstones. Blushing rose. Like one large petal, slantwise beneath her cheekbone. As if she\u0027d laid a\\n\\n rose against her cheek for a moment and it had left its imprint on her flesh.\\n\\n To Thierry, it was beautiful, because it was part of her. She\u0027d worn it in every lifetime after the first. But\\n\\n at the same time the very sight of it made his throat clamp shut and his fists clench in helpless grief and\\n\\n fury-fury against himself. The mark was his shame, his punishment. And his penance was to watch her\\n\\n wear it in her innocence through the years.\\n\\n He would pour out his blood on the dry Montana dirt right now if it would take the mark away. But\\n\\n nothing in either the Night World or the human world could do that-at least nothing he\u0027d found in\\n\\n uncounted years of searching.\\n\\n Oh, Goddess, he loved her.\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t allowed himself to feel it for so long- because the feeling could drive him insane while he was\\n\\n away from her. But now it came over him in a flood that he couldn\u0027t have resisted if he\u0027d tried. It made his\\n\\n heart pound and his body tremble. The sight of her lying there, warm and alive, separated from him by\\n\\n only a few flimsy boards and an equally flimsy human male...\\n\\n He wanted her. He wanted to yank off the boards, step through the window, brush aside the red-haired\\n\\n man, and take her in his arms. He wanted to carry her off into the night, holding her close to his heart, to\\n\\n some secret place where nobody could ever find her to hurt her.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t. He knew... from experience... that it didn\u0027t work. He\u0027d done it once or twice, and he\u0027d\\n\\n paid for it. She had hated him before she died.\\n\\n He would never risk that again.\\n\\n And so now, on this spring night near the turn of the millennium in the state of Montana in the United\\n\\n States of America, all Thierry could do was kneel outside a window and watch the newest incarnation of\\n\\n his only Jove.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t realize at first, though, what his only love was actually doing. Lupe had told him that Hannah\\n\\n Snow was seeing a psychologist. But it was only now, listening to what was going on in the room that\\n\\n Thierry slowly realized exactly what Hannah and the psychologist were up to.\\n\\n They were trying to recover her memories. Using hypnosis. Breaking into her subconscious as if it were\\n\\n some bank vault.\\n\\n It was dangerous.\\n\\n Not just because the guy performing the hypnosis didn\u0027t seem to know what he was doing. But because\\n\\n Hannah\u0027s memory was a time-bomb, full of trauma for her and deadly knowledge for any human.\\n\\n They shouldn\u0027t be doing this.\\n\\n Every muscle in Thierry\u0027s body was tense. But there was no way he could stop it. He could only\\n\\n listen-and wait.\\n\\n Paul repeated with slow resignation, \"He\u0027s not human.\"\\n\\n \"No. He\u0027s a Lord of the Night World. He\u0027s powerful... and evil,\" Hannah whispered. \"He\u0027s lived for\\n\\n thousands of years.\" She added, almost absently, \"I\u0027m the one who\u0027s been reincarnated.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, terrific. Well, that\u0027s a twist.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t believe me?\"\\n\\n Paul seemed to suddenly remember that he was talking with a patient-and a hypnotized patient at that.\\n\\n \"No, I-I mean, I don\u0027t know what to believe. If it\u0027s a fantasy, there\u0027s got to be something underneath it,\\n\\n some psychological reason for you to make it all up. And that\u0027s what we\u0027re looking for. What all this\\n\\n means to you.\" He hesitated, then said with new determination, \"Let\u0027s take you back to the first time you\\n\\n met this guy. Okay, I want you to relax in the light; you\u0027re feeling very good. And now I want you to go\\n\\n back through time, just like turning back the pages of a book. In your mind, go back. ...\"\\n\\n Hannah\u0027s ordinary mind was intruding, waking up, overriding the dreamy part of her that had been\\n\\n answering Paul\u0027s questions. \"Wait, I-I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s a good idea.\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t figure this out until we find out what it all symbolizes; what it means to you.\"\\n\\n Hannah still didn\u0027t feel convinced, but she had the feeling she wasn\u0027t supposed to argue under hypnosis.\\n\\n Maybe it doesn\u0027t matter, though, she thought. I\u0027m waking up now; I probably won\u0027t be able to go back.\\n\\n \"I want you to see yourself as fifteen years old, see yourself as fifteen. Go back to the time when you\\n\\n were fifteen. And now I want you to see yourself at twelve years old; go in your mind to the time when\\n\\n you are twelve. Now go farther back, see yourself at nine years old, at six years old, at three years old.\\n\\n Now go back and see yourself as a baby, as an infant. Feel very comfortable and see yourself as a tiny\\n\\n baby.\"\\n\\n Hannah couldn\u0027t help but listen. She did feel comfortable, and her mind did show her pictures as the\\n\\n years seemed to turn back. It was like watching a film of her life running backward, herself getting smaller\\n\\n and smaller, and in the end tiny and bald.\\n\\n \"And now,\" the soothing, irresistible voice said, \"I want you to go farther back. Back to the time before\\n\\n you were born. The time before you were born as Hannah Snow. You are floating in the red light, you\\n\\n feel very relaxed, and you are going back, back... to the time when you first met this man you think of\\n\\n as Thierry. Whatever that time might be, go back. Go back to the first time.\"\\n\\n Hannah was being drawn down a tunnel.\\n\\n She had no control and she was scared. It wasn\u0027t like the rumored near-death tunnel. It was red, with\\n\\n translucent, shining, pulsing walls-something like a womb. And she was being pulled or sucked through it\\n\\n at ever-increasing speed.\\n\\n No, she thought. But she couldn\u0027t say anything. It was all happening too fast and she couldn\u0027t make a\\n\\n \"Back to the first time,\" Paul intoned, and his words set up a sort of echo in Hannah\u0027s head, a whispering\\n\\n of many voices. As if a hundred Hannahs had\\n\\n all gotten together and murmured sibilantly, \"The First Time. The First Time.\"\\n\\n \"Go back... and you will begin to see pictures. You will see yourself, maybe in a strange place. Go\\n\\n back and see this.\" The First Time...\\n\\n No, Hannah thought again. And something very deep inside her whimpered, \"I don\u0027t want to see it.\" But\\n\\n she was still being pulled through the soft red tunnel, faster and faster. She had a feeling of unimaginable\\n\\n distance being crossed. And then ... she had a feeling of some threshold being reached. The First Time.\\n\\n She exploded into darkness, squirted out of the tunnel like a watermelon seed between wet ringers.\\n\\n Silence. Dark. And then-a picture. It opened like a tiny leaf unfolding out of a seed, got bigger until it\\n\\n surrounded her. It was like a scene from a movie, except that it was all around her, she seemed to be\\n\\n floating in the middle of it.\\n\\n \"What do you see?\" came Paul\u0027s voice softly from very far away.\\n\\n \"I see... me,\" Hannah said. \"It\u0027s me-it looks just like me. Except that I don\u0027t have a birthmark.\" She\\n\\n was full of wonder.\\n\\n \"Where are you? What do you see yourself doing?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know where I am.\" Hannah was too amazed to be frightened now. It was so strange . .. she\\n\\n could see this better than any memory of her real life. The scene was incredibly detailed. At the same\\n\\n time, it was completely unfamiliar to her. \"What I\u0027m doing... I\u0027m holding... something. A rock. And\\n\\n I\u0027m doing something with it to a little tiny... something.\" She sighed, defeated, then added, \"I\u0027m wearing\\n\\n animal skins! It\u0027s a sort of shirt and pants all made of skins. It\u0027s unbelievably... primitive. Paul, there\u0027s a\\n\\n cave behind me.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like you\u0027re really far back.\" Paul\u0027s voice sounded in stark contrast to Hannah\u0027s wonder and\\n\\n excitement. He was clearly bored. Amused, resigned, but bored.\\n\\n \"And-there\u0027s a girl beside me and she looks like Chess. Like my best friend, Chess. She\u0027s got the same\\n\\n face, the same eyes. She\u0027s wearing skins, too... some kind of skin dress.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, and it has about the detail of most of the past-life regressions in this book,\" Paul said wryly.\\n\\n Hannah could tell he was flipping pages. \"You\u0027re doing something to something with a rock. You\u0027re\\n\\n wearing some kind of skins. The book\u0027s full of descriptions like that. People who want to imagine\\n\\n themselves in the olden days, but who don\u0027t know the first thing about them,\" he muttered to himself.\\n\\n Hannah didn\u0027t wait for him to remember that he was talking to a hypnotized patient. \"But you didn\u0027t tell\\n\\n me to be the person back then. You just told me to see it.\"\\n\\n \"Huh? Oh. Okay, then, be that person.\" He said it so casually.\\n\\n Panic spurted through Hannah. \"Wait-I...\"\\n\\n But it was happening. She was falling, dissolving, merging into the scene around her. She was becoming\\n\\n the girl in front of the cave.\\n\\n The First Time...\\n\\n Distantly, she heard her own voice whispering, \"I\u0027m holding a flint burin, a tool for drilling. I\u0027m boring\\n\\n holes in the tooth of an arctic fox.\"\\n\\n \"Be that person,\" Paul was repeating mechanically, still in the bored voice. Then he said, \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Mother\u0027s going to be furious-I\u0027m supposed to be sorting fruit we stored last winter for the Spring,\\n\\n Gathering. There\u0027s not much left and it\u0027s mostly rotten. But Ran killed a fox and gave the skull to Ket, and\\n\\n we\u0027ve spent all morning knocking the teeth out and making them into a necklace for Ket. Ket just has to\\n\\n have something new to wear every festival.\" She heard Paul say softly, \"Oh, my God...\" Then he\\n\\n swallowed and said, \"Wait-you want to be a paleontologist, right? You know about old things...\" \"I want\\n\\n to be a what? I\u0027m going to be a shaman, like Old Mother. I should get married, but there\u0027s nobody I\\n\\n want. Ket keeps telling me I\u0027ll meet somebody at a gathering, but I don\u0027t think so.\" She shivered.\\n\\n \"Weird-I\u0027ve got chills all of a sudden. Old Mother says she can\u0027t see my destiny. She pretends that\u0027s\\n\\n nothing to worry about, but I know she\u0027s worried. That\u0027s why she wants me to be a shaman, so I can\\n\\n fight back if the spirits have something rotten in mind for me.\"\\n\\n Paul said, \"Hannah-uh, let\u0027s just make sure we can get you out of this, all right? You know, in case that\\n\\n should become necessary. Now, when I clap my hands you\u0027re going to awaken completely refreshed.\\n\\n Okay? Okay?\"\\n\\n \"My name\u0027s Hana.\" It was pronounced slightly differently: Hah-na. \"And I\u0027m already awake. Ket is\\n\\n laughing at me. She\u0027s threading the teeth on a sinew string. She says I\u0027m daydreaming. She\u0027s right; I\\n\\n wrecked the hole for this tooth.\"\\n\\n \"When I clap my hands, you\u0027re going to wake up. When I clap my hands, you\u0027re going to wake up. You\\n\\n will be Hannah Snow in Montana.\" A clap. \"Hannah, how do you feel?\" Another clap. \"Hannah?\\n\\n Hannah?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Hana. Hana of the River People. And I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about; I can\u0027t be somebody\\n\\n else.\" She stiffened. \"Wait-something\u0027s happening. There\u0027s some kind of commotion from the river.\\n\\n Something\u0027s going on.\"\\n\\n The voice was desperate. \"When I clap my hands-\"\\n\\n \"Shh. Be quiet.\" Something was happening and she had to see it, she had to know. She had to stand up.\\n\\n Hana of the Three Rivers stood up.\\n\\n \"Everybody\u0027s all excited by the river\u0027 she told Ket.\\n\\n \"Maybe Ran fell in,\" Ket said. \"No, that\u0027s too much to hope for. Hana, what am I going to do? He wants\\n\\n to mate me, but I just can\u0027t picture it. I want somebody interesting, somebody different. . . ,\" She held up\\n\\n the half-finished necklace. \"So what do you think?\"\\n\\n Hana barely glanced at her. Ket looked wonderful, with her short dark hair, her glowing slanted green\\n\\n eyes, and her mysterious smile. The necklace was attractive; red beads alternated with delicate\\n\\n milky-white teeth. \"Fine, beautiful. You\u0027ll break every heart at the gathering. I\u0027m going down to the river.\"\\n\\n Ket put down the necklace. \"Well, if you insist- wait for me.\"\\n\\n The river was broad and fast-flowing, covered with little white-capped waves because it had just been\\n\\n joined by two tributaries. Hana\u0027s people had rived in\\n\\n the limestone caves by the three rivers for longer than anyone could remember.\\n\\n Ket was behind her as Hana made her way through new green cattails to the bend in the river. And then\\n\\n , she saw what the fuss was about.\\n\\n There was a stranger crouching in the reeds. That was exciting enough-strangers didn\u0027t come very often.\\n\\n But this stranger was like no man Hana had ever seen.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a demon,\" Ket whispered, awed.\\n\\n It was a young man-a boy a few years older than Hana herself. He might have been handsome in other\\n\\n circumstances. His hair was very light blond, lighter than the dry grass of the steppes. His face was\\n\\n well-made; his tall body was lithe. Hana could see almost all of that body because he was only wearing a\\n\\n brief leather loincloth. That didn\u0027t bother her; everybody went naked in the summer when it was hot\\n\\n enough. But this wasn\u0027t summer; it was spring and the days could still be chilly. No sane person would go\\n\\n traveling without clothes.\\n\\n But that wasn\u0027t what shocked Hana, what held her standing there rigid with her heart pounding so hard\\n\\n she couldn\u0027t breathe. It was the rest of the boy\u0027s appearance. Ket was right-he was clearly a demon.\\n\\n His eyes were wrong. More like the eyes of a lynx or a wolverine than the eyes of a person. They\\n\\n seemed to throw the pale sunlight back at you when you looked into them. But the eyes were nothing\\n\\n compared to the teeth. His canine teeth were long and delicately curved. They came to a sharp and very\\n\\n non-human point.\\n\\n Almost involuntarily, Hana looked down at the fox tooth she still held in her palm. Yes, they were like\\n\\n that, only bigger.\\n\\n The boy was filthy, caked with mud from the river, his blond hair ruffled crazily, his eyes staring wildly\\n\\n from side to side. There was blood on his mouth and chin.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a demon, all right,\" one of the men said. Five men were standing around the crouching boy, several\\n\\n of them with spears, others with hastily grabbed rocks. \"What else could have a human body with animal\\n\\n eyes and teeth?\"\\n\\n \"A spirit?\" Hana said. She didn\u0027t realize that she was going to say it until the words were out. But then,\\n\\n with everybody looking at her, she drew herself up tall. \"Whether he\u0027s a demon or a spirit, you\u0027d better\\n\\n not hurt him. It\u0027s Old Mother who should decide what to do with him. This is a matter for shamans.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not a shaman yet,\" another of the men said. It was Arno, a very broad-shouldered man who\\n\\n was the leader of the hunters. Hana didn\u0027t like him.\\n\\n And she wasn\u0027t sure why she had spoken up in favor of the stranger. There was something in his eyes,\\n\\n the look of a suffering animal. He seemed so alone, and so frightened-and so much in pain, even though\\n\\n there were no visible wounds on his body.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s right, we\u0027d better take him to Old Mother,\" one of the hunters said. \"Should we hit him on the\\n\\n head and tie him up, or do you think we can just herd him?\"\\n\\n But at that moment, a high thin sound came to Hana over the rushing of the river. It was a woman\\n\\n screaming.\\n\\n \"Help me! Somebody come help me! Ryl\u0027s been attacked!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-4.html","bookId":2080,"book":{"id":2080,"title":"Night World : Soulmate (Night World #6)","description":"Storyline: Soulmate (Night World Book 6) \\n Hannah Snow\u0027s life was perfect...until the notes started appearing.
