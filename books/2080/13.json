{"id":88815,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Don\u0027t fight,\" he panted into her face. \"It\u0027ll be easier if you just relax.\" Hannah was frightened-and furious. \"In your dreams!\" she gasped and slammed a knee into his groin. She hadn\u0027t survived Maya and come thousands of miles to be killed by some weasel of a vampire. She could feel him trying to do something to her mind-it reminded her of the way Maya had captured Ha-nahkt\u0027s eyes. Some kind of hypnosis, she supposed. But she\u0027d had enough of hypnosis in the last week. She fought it. And she fought with her body, unskillfully maybe, but with utter conviction. She head-butted him on the nose when he tried to get close to her neck. \"Ow!\" The Artful Dodger jerked back. Then he got a better grip on her arm. He pulled the wrist toward him and Hannah suddenly realized what he was doing. There were nice accessible veins there. He was going to draw blood from her wrist. \"No, you don\u0027t,\" she gasped. She had no idea what would happen if she lost any more blood to a vampire. Thierry had said she wasn\u0027t in danger as long as she kept away from them for the next week, so she presumed that if she didn\u0027t stay away, she was in danger. And she was already noticing little changes in herself: her ability to see better in the dark, for instance. She tried to wrench her arm out of the boy\u0027s grip- and then she heard a gasp. Suddenly she realized that he wasn\u0027t holding her as tightly, and he wasn\u0027t trying to pull her wrist to him. Instead he was just staring at her hand. At her ring. The expression on his face might have been funny if Hannah hadn\u0027t been shaking with adrenaline. He looked shocked, dismayed, scared, disbelieving, and embarrassed all at once. \"Who-who-who are you?\" he spluttered. Hannah looked at the ring, and then at him. Of course. How could she have been so stupid? She should have mentioned Thierry right away. If he was a Lord of the Night World, maybe everybody knew him. Maybe she could skip the witches altogether. \"I told you I was looking for somebody. His name is Thierry Descouedres. He gave me this ring.\" The Artful Dodger gave a kind of moan. Then he looked up at her from under his spiky bangs. \"I didn\u0027t hurt you, did I?\" he said. It wasn\u0027t a question, it was a demand for agreement. \"I didn\u0027t do anything to you.\" \"You didn\u0027t get the chance,\" Hannah said. But she was afraid the boy might just take off running, so she added, \"I don\u0027t want to get you in trouble. I just want to find Thierry. Can you help me?\" \"I ... help you. Yeah, yeah. I can be a big help.-\" He hesitated, then said, \"It\u0027s kind of a long walk.\" A walk? Thierry was here? Hannah\u0027s heart leaped so high that her whole body felt light. \"I\u0027m not tired,\" she said, and it was true. \"I can walk anywhere.\" The house was enormous. Magnificent. Palatial, even. Awe-inspiring. The Artful Dodger abandoned Hannah at the beginning of the long palm-tree-lined drive, blurting, \"That\u0027s it,\" and then scampering off into the darkness. Hannah looked after him for a moment, then grimly started up the drive, sincerely hoping that it was it. She was so tired that she was weaving and her feet felt as if they\u0027d been pounded with stones. As she walked up to the front door, though, her doubts disappeared. There were black roses everywhere. There was an arch-shaped stained-glass window above the double doors, showing a black rose that had the same intricately knotted stem as the one on Hannah\u0027s ring. The same design had been worked into the crowns over the windows. It was used like a family crest or seal. Just seeing all those roses made Hannah\u0027s heart beat faster. Okay, then. Ring the doorbell, she told herself. And stop feeling like some Cinderella who\u0027s come to see what\u0027s keeping the prince. She pushed the doorbell button, then held her breath as chimes echoed distantly. Please. Please answer.... She heard footsteps approaching and her heart really started to pound. I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s all been this easy.... But when the door opened, it wasn\u0027t Thierry. It was a college-age guy with a suit, brown hair pulled back into a short ponytail, and dark glasses. He looked vaguely like a young CIA agent, Hannah thought He and Hannah stared at each other. \"Uh, I\u0027m here to ... I\u0027m looking for Thierry Des-couedres,\" Hannah said finally, trying to sound confident. The CIA guy didn\u0027t change expression. When he spoke, it wasn\u0027t unkindly, but Hannah\u0027s heart plummeted. \"He\u0027s not here. Try again in a few days. And it\u0027s better to call one of his secretaries before showing up.\" He started to shut the door. A wave of desperation broke over Hannah. \"Wait!\" she said, and she actually stuck her foot in the doorway. She was amazed at herself. The CIA guy looked down at her foot, then up at her face. \"Yes?\" Oh, God, he thinks I\u0027m a nuisance visitor. Hannah suddenly had a vision of swarms of petitioners lined up at Thierry\u0027s house, all wanting him to do something for them. Like supplicants waiting for an audience with the king. And I must look like riffraff, she thought. She was wearing Levis and a shirt that was sweaty and wrinkled after tramping around the Strip all day. Her boots were dusty. Her hair was limp and disheveled, straggling over her face. \"Yes?\" the CIA guy said again, politely urgent. . \"I ... nothing.\" Hannah felt tears spring to her eyes and was furious with herself. She hid them by bending down to pick up her duffel bag, which by now felt as if it were loaded with rocks. She had never been so tired. Her mouth was dry and cottony and her muscles were starting to cramp. She had no idea where to find a safe place to sleep. But it wasn\u0027t the CIA guy\u0027s problem. \"Thank you,\" Hannah said. She took a deep breath and started to turn away. It was the deep breath that did it. Someone was crossing the grand entrance hall behind the CIA guy and the breath delayed Hannah long enough that they saw each other. \"Nilsson, wait!\" the someone yelled and came bounding over to the door. It was a girl, thin and tanned, with odd silvery-brown hair and dark amber eyes. She had several yellowing bruises on her face. But it was her expression that startled Hannah. Her amber eyes were wide and sparkling in what looked like recognition, her mouth was open in astonishment and excitement. She was waving her arms. \"That\u0027s her!\" she yelled at the CIA guy, pointing to Hannah. \"It\u0027s her! It\u0027s her.\" When he stared at her, she hit him in the shoulder. \"Her!\" They both turned to stare at Hannah. The CIA guy had an expression now. He looked stunned. Hannah stared back at them, bewildered. Then, seeming dazed, the CIA guy very slowly opened the door. \"My name is Nilsson, miss,\" he said. \"Please come inside.\" Stupid me, Hannah thought. Almost as an afterthought, she pushed straggling hair off her left cheek, away from her birthmark. I should have told them who I was. But how could I know they would understand? Nilsson was talking again as he gently took her bag. \"I\u0027m very sorry, miss-I didn\u0027t realize ... I hope you won\u0027t hold this-\" \"Nobody knew you were coming,\" the girl broke in with refreshing bluntness. \"And the worst thing is that Thierry\u0027s gone off somewhere. I don\u0027t think anybody knows where or when he\u0027ll be back. But meanwhile you\u0027d better stay put. I don\u0027t want to think about what he\u0027d do to us if we lost you.\" She smiled at Hannah and added, \"I\u0027m Lupe Acevedo.\" \"Hannah Snow.\" \"I know.\" The girl winked. \"We met before, but I couldn\u0027t exactly introduce myself. Don\u0027t you remember?\" Hannah started to shake her head-and then she blinked. Blinked again. That silvery-brown coloring... those amber eyes... \"Yeah,\" Lupe said, looking hugely delighted. \"That was me. That\u0027s how I got these bruises. The other wolf got it worse, though. I ripped him a new-\" \"Would you like something to drink?\" Nilsson interrupted hastily. \"Or to eat? Why don\u0027t you come in and sit down?\" Hannah\u0027s mind was reeling. That girl is a werewolf, she thought. A werewolf. The last time I saw her she had big ears and a bushy tail. Werewolves are real. And this one protected me. She said dizzily, \"I ... thank you. I mean, you saved my life, didn\u0027t you?\" Lupe shrugged. \"Part of the job. Want a Coke?\" Hannah blinked, then laughed. \"I\u0027d kill for one.\" \"I\u0027ll take care of it,\" Nilsson said. \"I\u0027ll take care of everything. Lupe, why don\u0027t you show her upstairs?\" He hurried off and opened a cellular phone. A moment later several other guys dressed like him came running. The strange thing was that they were all very young-all in their late teens. Hannah caught snatches of frantic-sounding conversation. \"Well, try that number-\" \"What about leaving a message with-\" \"Come on,\" Lupe said, interrupting Hannah\u0027s eavesdropping. With that same cheerful bluntness she added, \"You look like you could use a bath.\" She led Hannah past a giant white sculpture toward a wide curving staircase. Hannah glimpsed other rooms opening off the hallway. A living room that looked as big as a football field, decorated with white couches, geometric furniture, and abstract paintings. A dining room with a mile-long table. An alcove with a grand piano. Hannah felt more like Cinderella than ever. Nobody in Medicine Rock had a grand piano. I didn\u0027t know he was so rich. I don\u0027t know if I can deal with this. But when she was installed in a sort of Moorish fantasy bathroom, surrounded by jungly green plants and exotic tiles and brass globe lights with cut-out star shapes, she decided that she could probably adjust to living this way. If forced. It was heaven just to relax in the Jacuzzi tub, drinking a Coke and breathing in the delicious scent of bath salts. And it was even better to sit up in bed afterward, eating finger sandwiches sent up by \"Chef\" and telling Lupe how she came to be in Las Vegas. When she was done, Lupe said, \"Nilsson and everybody are trying to find Thierry. It may take a little while, though. See, he just stopped off for a few minutes on Saturday, and then he disappeared again. But meanwhile, this house is pretty well protected. And all of us will fight for you-I mean, fight to the death, if we have to. So it\u0027s safer than most other places.\" Hannah felt a roiling in her stomach. She didn\u0027t understand. Lupe made it sound as if they were in some castle getting ready for a siege. \"Safe from... ?\" Lupe looked surprised. \"From her-Maya,\" she said, as if it should be obvious. Hannah had a sinking feeling. I should have known, she thought. But all she said was, \"So you think I\u0027m still in danger from her.\" Lupe\u0027s eyebrows shot up. She said mildly, \"Well, sure. She\u0027s going to try to kill you. And she\u0027s awfully good at killing.\" Especially me, Hannah thought. But she was too tired to be much afraid. Trusting to Lupe and Nilsson and the rest of Thierry\u0027s household, she fell asleep \"that night as soon as her head touched the pillow. She woke up to see sunshine. It was reflecting off the bedroom walls, which were painted a softly burnished gold. Weird but beautiful, Hannah thought, looking dreamily around at ebony furniture and decorative tribal masks. Then she remembered where she was and jumped out of bed. She found clean clothes-her size-lying on an elaborately carved chest. She had just finished pulling them on when Lupe knocked on the door. \"Lupe, have they-\" Lupe shook her silvery-brown head. \"They haven\u0027t found him yet.\" Hannah sighed, then smiled, trying not to look too disappointed. Lupe made a sympathetic face. \"I know. While you wait, though, you might like to meet some people.\" She grinned. \"They\u0027re sort of special people, and it\u0027s a secret that they\u0027re even here. But I talked to them last night, and they all decided that it would be okay. They all want to meet you.\" Hannah was curious. \"Special people? Are they humans or... uh... ?\" Lupe grinned even more widely. \"They\u0027re both. That\u0027s why they\u0027re special.\" As she talked, she was leading Hannah downstairs and through miles of hallway. \"They did something for me,\" she said, not smiling now, but serious. \"They saved my life and my mom\u0027s life. See, I\u0027m not a purebred werewolf. My dad was human.\" Hannah looked at her, startled. \"Yeah. And that\u0027s against the laws of the Night World. You can\u0027t fall in love with a human, much less marry them. The other werewolves came one night and killed my dad. They would have killed my mom and me, too, but Thierry got us out of the city and hid us. That\u0027s why I\u0027d do anything for him. I wouldn\u0027t be alive if it wasn\u0027t for him... and Circle Daybreak.\" She had paused by the door of a room located toward the back of the house. Now, she opened the door, gave Hannah a funny little nod and a wink, and said, \"You go meet them. I think you\u0027ll like each other. You\u0027re their type.\" Hannah wasn\u0027t sure what this meant. She felt shy as she stepped over the threshold and looked around the room. It was a den, smaller than the front living room, and more cozy, with furniture in warm ochers and burnt siennas. A breakfast buffet was set out on a long sideboard made of golden pine. It smelled good, but Hannah didn\u0027t have time to look at it. As soon as she came in the room, every head turned and she found a dozen people staring at her. Young people. All around her age. Normal-type teenagers, except that a surprising number of them were extremely good-looking. Behind her, the door closed firmly. Hannah felt more and more as if she\u0027d just walked out on stage and forgotten her lines. Then one of the girls sitting on an ottoman jumped up and ran to her. \"You\u0027re Hana, aren\u0027t you?\" she said warmly. \"Hannah. Yes.\" \"I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m really meeting you! This is so exciting. Thierry\u0027s told us all about you.\" She put a gentle hand on Hannah\u0027s arm. \"Hannah, this is Circle Daybreak. And my name is Thea Harman.\" She was almost as tall as Hannah was, and the yellow hair spilling over her shoulders was a few shades darker than Hannah\u0027s. Her eyes were brown and soft and somehow wise. \"Hi, Thea.\" Somehow Hannah felt instinctively at ease with this girl. \"Lupe was telling me about Circle Daybreak, but I didn\u0027t exactly understand.\" \"It started as a sort of witch organization,\" Thea said. \"A witch circle. But it\u0027s not just for witches. It\u0027s for humans and vampires and werewolves and shapeshifters... and, well, anybody who wants to help Night People and humans get along. Come and meet the others and we\u0027ll try to explain.\" A few minutes later, Hannah was sitting on a couch with a plate of eggs Benedict, being introduced. \"This is James and Poppy,\" Thea said. \"James is a Redfern on his mother\u0027s side-which makes him a descendant of Maya\u0027s.\" She glanced at James with gentle mischief. \"I didn\u0027t pick my parents. Believe me, I didn\u0027t,\" James said to Hannah. He had light brown hair and thoughtful gray eyes. When he smiled it was impossible not to smile back. \"Nobody would have picked your parents, Jamie,\" Poppy said, elbowing him. She was very small, but there was a kind of impish wisdom in her face. Her head was a tangle of copper curls and her eyes were as green as emeralds. Hannah found her elfin beauty just a little scary... just a little inhuman. \"They\u0027re both vampires,\" Thea said, answering Hannah\u0027s unspoken question. \"I didn\u0027t used to be,\" Poppy said. \"James changed me because I was dying.\" \"What\u0027s a soulmate for?\" James said, and Poppy poked him again and then grinned at him. They were obviously in love. \"You\u0027re-soulmates?\" Hannah spoke softly, wistfully. It was Thea who answered. \"That\u0027s the thing, you see-something is causing Night People to find human soulmates. We witches think that it\u0027s some Power that\u0027s waking up again, making it happen. Some Power that\u0027s been asleep for a long time- maybe since the time when Thierry was born.\" Now Hannah understood why Lupe had said she was Circle Daybreak\u0027s type of people. She was part of this. \"But-that\u0027s wonderful,\" she said, speaking slowly and trying to gather her thoughts. \"I mean...\" She couldn\u0027t exactly explain why it was so wonderful, but she had a sense of some immense turning point being reached in the world, of some cycle that was about to end. Thea was smiling at her. \"I know what you mean. We think so, too.\" She turned and held out a hand to a very tall boy with a sweet face, sandy hair, and hazel eyes. \"And this is my soulmate, Eric. He\u0027s human.\" \"Just barely,\" a boy from the other side of the room said. Eric ignored him and smiled at Hannah. \"And this is Gillian and David,\" Thea said, moving around the circle. \"Gillian\u0027s a distant cousin of mine, a witch, and David\u0027s human. Soulmates, again.\" Gillian was tiny, with white-blond hair that fit her head like a silky cap and deep violet eyes. David had dark hair, brown eyes, and a lean tanned face. They both smiled at Hannah. Thea was moving on. \"And next comes Rashel and Quinn. Rashel is human-she used to be a vampire hunter.\" \"I still am. But now I just hunt bad vampires,\" Rashel said coolly. Hannah had an instinctive feeling of respect for her. She was tall and seemed to have perfect control of her body. Her hair was black and her eyes were a fierce and blazing green. \"And Quinn\u0027s a vampire,\" Thea said. Quinn was the boy who\u0027d made the barely-human remark. He was very good-looking, with clean features that were strongly chiseled but almost delicate. His hair was as black as Rashel\u0027s, and his eyes were black, too. He flashed Hannah a smile that, while beautiful, was slightly unnerving. \"Quinn\u0027s the only one here who can compete with you as far as the past goes,\" Thea added. \"He was made into a vampire back in the sixteen hundreds, by Hunter Redfern.\" Quinn flashed another smile. \"Did you have a life in colonial America? Maybe we\u0027ve met.\" Hannah smiled in return, but she was also studying him with interest. He didn\u0027t look older than eighteen. \"Is that why everybody here looks so young?\" she asked. \"All the staff, I mean-Nilsson and the other guys in suits. Are they all vampires?\" Thea nodded. \"All made vampires. Lamia, like James, can grow up if they want. But once you make a human into a vampire they stop aging-and you can\u0027t make somebody over nineteen into a vampire. Their bodies can\u0027t make the change. They just burn out.\" Hannah felt an odd chill, almost of premonition. But before she could say anything, a new voice interrupted. \"Speaking of the lamia, isn\u0027t anybody going to introduce me?\" Thea turned toward the window. \"Sorry, Ash-but if you\u0027re going to sleep over there, you can\u0027t blame us for forgetting you.\" She looked at Hannah. \"This is another Redfern, a cousin of James\u0027s. His name is Ash.\" Ash was gorgeous, lanky and elegant, with ash-blond hair. But what startled Hannah as he got up and unhurriedly walked to meet her was his eyes. They were like Maya\u0027s eyes, shifting color from moment to moment. The resemblance was so striking that it was a moment before Hannah could take his hand. He\u0027s got Maya\u0027s genes, Hannah thought. He smiled at her, then sprawled on the loveseat. \"We\u0027re not all of Circle Daybreak, of course,\" Thea said. \"In fact, we\u0027re some of the newest members. And we\u0027re from all over the country-North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, everywhere. But Thierry called us together specially, to talk about the soulmate principle and the old Powers awakening.\" \"That was last week, before he found out about you,\" copper-haired Poppy said. \"And before he ran off. But we\u0027ve been talking without him, trying to figure out what to do next.\" Hannah said, \"Whatever it is, I\u0027d like to help you.\" They all looked pleased. But Thea said, \"You should think about it first. We\u0027re dangerous people to know.\" \"We\u0027re on everybody\u0027s hit list,\" Rashel, the black-haired vampire hunter, said dryly. \"We\u0027ve got the whole Night World against us,\" Ash said, rolling his ever-changing eyes. \"Against us. You just said \u0027us.\u0027 \" James turned on his cousin triumphantly, as if he\u0027d just won a point in an argument. \"You admit you\u0027re a part of us.\" \"I don\u0027t have any Ash looked at the ceiling, choice.\" \"But you do, Hannah,\" Thea interrupted. She smiled at Hannah, but her soft brown eyes were serious. \"You don\u0027t have to be in any more danger than you are now.\" \"I think-\" Hannah began. But before she could finish, there was an explosion of noise from somewhere outside.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-13.html","bookId":2080,"book":{"id":2080,"title":"Night World : Soulmate (Night World #6)","description":"Storyline: Soulmate (Night World Book 6) Hannah Snow\u0027s life was perfect...until the notes started appearing.
