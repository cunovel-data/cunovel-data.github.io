{"id":88804,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Hannah found herself on her feet. Her awareness was fragmented and understanding came to her in pieces because she simply couldn\u0027t take in the whole situation at once. It was too bizarre. At first she simply thought of a bomb. The explosion was that loud. Then she realized that something had come in the window, that it had come flying through the glass. And that it was in the room with her now, crouching among the broken shards of windowpane. Even then, she couldn\u0027t identify it. It was too incongruous; her mind refused to recognize the shape immediately. Something pretty big-something dark, it offered. A body like a dog\u0027s but set higher, with longer legs. Yellow eyes. And then, as if the right lens had suddenly clicked in front of her eyes, she saw it clearly. A wolf. There was a big black wolf in the room with her. It was a gorgeous animal, rangy and muscular, with ebony-colored fur and a white streak on its throat like a bolt of lightning. It was looking at her fixedly, with an almost human expression. Escaped fromYellowstone , Hannah thought dazedly. The naturalists were reintroducing wolves to the park, weren\u0027t they? It couldn\u0027t be wild; Ryan Harden\u0027s great-grandpa had bragged for years about killing the last wolf in Amador county when he was a boy. Anyway, she told herself, wolves don\u0027t attack people. They never attack people. A single wolf would never attack a full-grown teenager. And all the time her conscious mind was thinking this, something deeper was making her move. It made her back up slowly, never taking her eyes off the wolf, until she felt the bookcase behind her. There\u0027s something you need to get, a voice in her mind was whispering to her. It wasn\u0027t like the voice of another person, but it wasn\u0027t exactly like her own mental voice, either. It was a voice like a dark cool wind: competent and rather bleak. Something you saw on a shelf earlier, it said. In an impossibly graceful motion, from eight feet away, the wolf leaped. There was no time to be scared. Hannah saw a bushy, flowing black arc coming at her and then she was slammed into the bookcase. For a while after that, everything was simply chaos. Books and knick-knacks were falling around her. She was trying to get her balance, trying to push the heaviness of a furry body away from her. The wolf was falling back, then jumping again as she twisted sideways to get away. And the strangest thing was that she actually was getting away. Or at least evading the worst of the wolf\u0027s lunges, which seemed to be aimed at knocking her to the floor. Her body was moving as if this were, somehow instinctive to her, as if she knew how to do this. But I don\u0027t know this. I never fight... and I\u0027ve certainly never played dodge ball with a wolf before.... As she thought it, her movements slowed. She didn\u0027t feel sure and instinctive any longer. She felt confused. And the wolf seemed to know it. Its eyes glowed eerily yellow in the light of a lamp that was lying on its side. They were such strange eyes, more intense and more savage than any animal\u0027s she\u0027d ever seen. She saw it draw its legs beneath it. Move-now, the mysterious new part of her mind snapped. Hannah moved. The wolf hit the bookcase with incredible force, and then the bookcase itself was falling. Hannah flung herself sideways in time to avoid being crushed-but the case fell with an unholy noise directly in front of the door. Trapped, the dark cool voice in Hannah\u0027s mind noted analytically. No exit anymore, except the window. \"Hannah? Hannah?\" It was Paul\u0027s voice just outside the room. The door flew open-all of four inches. It jammed against the fallen bookcase. \"God-what\u0027s going on in there? Hannah? Hannah!\" He sounded panicked now, banging the door uselessly against the blockage. Don\u0027t think about him, the new part of Hannah\u0027s mind said sharply, but Hannah couldn\u0027t help it. He sounded so desperate. She opened her mouth to shout back to him, her concentration broken. And the wolf lunged. This time Hannah didn\u0027t move fast enough. A terrible weight smashed into her and she was falling, flying. She landed hard, her head smacking into the floorboards. It hurt. Even as she felt it, everything grayed out. Her vision went sparkling, her mind soared away from the pain, and a strange thought flickered through her head. I\u0027m dead now. It\u0027s over again. Oh, Isis, Goddess of Life, guide me to the other world.... \"Hannah! Hannah! What\u0027s going on in there?\" Paul\u0027s frantic voice came to her dimly. Hannah\u0027s vision cleared and the bizarre thoughts vanished. She wasn\u0027t soaring in sparkling emptiness and she wasn\u0027t dead. She was lying on the floor with a book\u0027s sharp corner in the small of her back and a wolf on her chest. Even in the midst of her terror, she felt a strange appalled fascination. She had never seen a wild animal this close. She could see the white-tipped guard hairs standing erect on its face and neck; she could see saliva glistening on its lolling red tongue. She could smell its breath-humid and hot, vaguely dog-like but much wilder. And she couldn\u0027t move, she realized. The wolf was as long as she was tall, and it weighed more than she did. Pinned underneath it, she was utterly helpless. All she could do was lie there shivering as the narrow, almost delicate muzzle got closer and closer to her face. Her eyes closed involuntarily as she felt the cold wetness of its nose on her cheek. It wasn\u0027t an affectionate gesture. The wolf was nudging at strands of her hair that had fallen across her face. Using its muzzle like a hand to push the hair away. Oh, God, please make it stop, Hannah thought. But she was the only one who could stop this-and she didn\u0027t know how. Now the cold nose was moving across her cheekbone. Its sniffing was loud in her ear. The wolf seemed to be smelling her, tasting her, and looking at her all at once. No. Not looking at me. Looking at my birthmark. It was another one of those ridiculous, impossible thoughts-and it snapped into place like the last piece in a puzzle deep inside her. Irrational as it was, Hannah felt absolutely certain it was true. And it set off the cool wind voice in her mind again. Reach out, the voice whispered, quiet and businesslike. Feel around you. The weapon has to be there somewhere. You saw it on the bookcase. Find it. The wolf stopped its explorations, seeming satisfied. It lifted its head... and laughed. Really laughed. It was the eeriest and most frightening thing Hannah had ever seen. The big mouth opened, panting, showing teeth, and the yellow eyes blazed with hot bestial triumph. Hurry, hurry. Hannah\u0027s eyes were helplessly fixed on the sharp white teeth ten inches away from her face, but her hand was creeping out, feeling along the smooth pine floorboards around her. Her fingers glided over books, over the feathery texture of a fern-and then over something square and cold and faced with glass. The wolf didn\u0027t seem to notice. Its lips were pulling back farther and farther. Not laughing anymore. Hannah could see its short front teeth and its long curving canines. She could see its forehead wrinkling. And she could feel its body vibrate in a low and vicious growl. The sound of absolute savagery. The cool wind voice had taken over Hannah\u0027s mind completely. It was telling her what would happen next. The wolf would sink his teeth into her throat and then shake her, tearing skin and ripping muscles away. Her blood would spray like a fountain. It would fill her severed windpipe and her lungs and her mouth. She would die gasping and choking, maybe drowning before she bled out. Except. . . that she had silver in her hand. A silver picture frame. Kill it, the cool voice whispered. You\u0027ve got the right weapon. Hit it dead in the eye with a corner. Drive silver into its brain. Hannah\u0027s ordinary mind didn\u0027t even try to figure out how a picture frame could possibly be the right weapon. It didn\u0027t object, either. But faint and faraway, there came another voice in her head. Like the cool wind voice, it wasn\u0027t hers, but it wasn\u0027t someone else\u0027s, either. It was a clear crystal voice that seemed to sparkle in jeweled colors as it spoke. You are not a killer. You don\u0027t kill. You have never killed, no matter what happened to you. You do not kill. I don\u0027t kill, Hannah thought slowly, in agreement. Then you\u0027re going to die, the cool wind voice said brutally, much louder than the crystal voice. Because this animal won\u0027t stop until either it\u0027s dead or you are. There\u0027s no other way to deal with these creatures. Then it happened. The wolf\u0027s mouth opened. In a lightning-fast move, it darted for her throat. Hannah didn\u0027t think. She brought the picture frame up ... and slammed it into the side of the wolf\u0027s head. Not into the eye. Into the ear. She felt the impact-hard metal against sensitive flesh. The wolf gave a yelping squeal and staggered sideways, shaking its head and hitting at its face with a forepaw. Its weight was off her for an instant, and an instant was all Hannah needed. Her body moved without her conscious direction, sliding out from under the wolf, twisting and jumping to her feet. She kept her grasp on the picture frame. Now. Look around! The bookcase-no, you can\u0027t move it. The window! Go for the window. But the wolf had stopped shaking its head. Even as Hannah started across the room, it turned and saw her. In one flowing, bushy leap it put itself between her and the window. Then it stood looking at her, every hair on its body bristling. Its teeth were bared, its ears upright, and its eyes glared with pure hatred and menace. It\u0027s going to spring, Hannah realized. I am not a killer. I can\u0027t kill. You don\u0027t have any choice- The wolf sprang. But it never reached her. Something else came soaring through the window and knocked it off course. This time, Hannah\u0027s eyes and brain identified the creature at once. Another wolf. My God, what is going on? The new animal was gray-brown, smaller than the black wolf and not as striking. Its legs were amazingly delicate, twined with veins and sinews like a racehorse\u0027s. A female, something faraway in Hannah\u0027s mind said with dreamlike certainty. Both wolves had recovered their balance now. They were on their feet, bristling. The room smelled like a zoo. And now I\u0027m really going to die, Hannah thought. I\u0027m going to be torn to pieces by two wolves. She was still clutching the picture frame, but she knew there was no chance of fighting them both off at once. They were going to rip her to bits, quarreling over who got more of her. Her heart was pounding so hard that it shook her body, and her ears were ringing. The female wolf was staring at her with eyes more amber than yellow, and Hannah stared back, mesmerized, waiting for it to make its move. The wolf held the gaze for another moment, as if studying Hannah\u0027s face-in particular the left side of her face. Her cheek. Then she turned her back to Hannah and faced the black wolf. And snarled. Protecting me, Hannah thought, stunned. It was unbelievable-but she was beyond disbelief at this point. She had stepped out of her ordinary life and into a fairy tale full of almost-human wolves. The entire world had gone crazy and all she could do was try to deal with each moment as it came. They\u0027re going to fight, the cool wind voice in her mind told her. As soon as they\u0027re into it, run for the At that moment everything erupted into bedlam. The gray wolf had launched herself at the black. The room echoed with the sound of snarling-and of teeth clicking together as both wolves snapped again and Hannah couldn\u0027t make out what was going on in the fight. It was just a blurred chaos as the wolves circled and darted and leaped and ducked. But it was by far the most terrifying thing she had ever witnessed. Like the worst dog fight imaginable, like the feeding frenzy of sharks. Both animals seemed to have gone berserk. Suddenly there was a yelp of pain. Blood welled up on the gray female\u0027s flank. She\u0027s too small, Hannah thought. Too light. She doesn\u0027t have a chance. Help her, the crystal voice whispered. It was an insane suggestion. Hannah couldn\u0027t even imagine trying to get in the middle of that snarling whirlwind. But somehow she found herself moving anyway. Placing herself behind the gray wolf. It didn\u0027t matter that she didn\u0027t believe she was doing it, or that she had no idea how to team up with a wolf in fighting another wolf. She was there and she was holding her silver picture frame high. The black wolf pulled away from the fight to stare at her. And there they stood, all three of them panting, Hannah with fear and the wolves with exertion. They were frozen like a tableau in the middle of the wrecked office, all looking at each other tensely. The black wolf on one side, his eyes shining with single-minded menace. The gray wolf on the other, blood matting her coat, bits of fur floating away from her. And Hannah right behind her, holding up the picture frame in a shaking hand. Hannah\u0027s ears were filled with the deep reverberating sound of growling. And then a deafening report that cut through the room like a knife. A gunshot. The black wolf yelped and staggered. Hannah\u0027s senses had been focused on what was going on inside the room for so long that it was a shock to realize there was anything, outside it. She was dimly aware that Paul\u0027s yells had stopped some time ago, but she hadn\u0027t stopped to consider what that meant. Now, with adrenaline washing over her, she heard his voice. \"Hannah! Get out of the way!\" The shout was tense, edged with fear and anger- and determination. It came from the opposite side of the room, from the darkness outside the window. Paul was there at the broken window with a gun. His face was pale and his hand was shaking. He was aiming in the general direction of the wolves. If he fired again he might hit either of them. \"Get into a corner!\" The gun bobbed nervously. Hannah heard herself say, \"Don\u0027t shoot!\" Her voice came out hoarse and unused-sounding. She moved to get in between the gun and the wolves. \"Don\u0027t shoot,\" she said again. \"Don\u0027t hit the gray one.\" \"Hit the gray one?\" Paul\u0027s voice rose in something like hysterical laughter. \"I don\u0027t even know if I can hit the wall! This is the first time I\u0027ve ever shot a gun. So just-just try to get out of the way!\" \"No!\" Hannah moved toward him, holding out her hand. \"I can shoot. Just give it to me-\" \"Just move out of the way-\" The gun went off. For an instant Hannah couldn\u0027t see where the bullet had gone and she wondered wildly if she had been shot. Then she saw that the black wolf was lurching backward. Blood dripped from its neck. Steel won\u0027t kill it, the wind voice hissed. You\u0027re only making it more angry. . But the black wolf was swinging its head to look with blazing eyes from Hannah with her picture frame to Paul with his gun, to the gray wolf with her teeth. The gray wolf snarled just then and Hannah had never seen an animal look closer to being smug. \"One more shot...\" Paul breathed. \"While it\u0027s cornered...\" Ears flat, the black wolf turned toward the only other window in the room. It launched into a vaulting leap straight toward the unbroken glass. There was a shattering crash as it went through. Glass fragments flew everywhere, tinkling. Hannah stared dizzily at the curtains swirling first outside, then inside the room, and then her head snapped around to look at the gray wolf. Amber eyes met hers directly. It was such a human stare... and definitely the look of an equal. Almost the look of a friend. Then the gray wolf twisted and loped for the newly broken window. Two steps and a leap-she was through. From somewhere outside there came a long drawn-out howl of anger and defiance. It was fading, as if the wolf was moving away. Then silence. Hannah shut her eyes. Her knees literally felt as if they wanted to buckle. But she made herself move to the window, glass grating under her boots as she stared into the night. The moon was bright, one day past full. She thought she could just see a dark shape loping toward the open prairie, but it might have been her imagination. She let out her breath and sagged against the window. The silver picture frame fell to the floor. \"Are you hurt? Are you okay?\" Paul was climbing through the other window. He tripped on a waste-basket getting across the room, then he was beside her, grabbing for her shoulders, trying to look her over. \"I think I\u0027m all right.\" She was numb, was what she was. She felt dazed and fragmented. He blinked at her. \"Um .. . you have some particular fondness for gray wolves or something?\" Hannah shook her head. How could she ever explain? They stared at each other for a moment, and then, simultaneously, they both sank to the floor, squatting among the shards of glass, breathing hard. Paul\u0027s face was white, his red hair disheveled, his eyes large and stunned. He ran a shaky hand over his forehead, then put the gun down and patted it. He twisted his neck to stare at the wreck of his office, the overturned bookcase, the scattered books and knickknacks, the two broken windows, the glass fragments, the bullet hole, the flecks of blood, and the tufts of wolf hair that still drifted across the pine floorboards. Hannah said faintly, \"So who was at the door?\" Paul blinked twice. \"Nobody. Nobody was at the door.\" He added almost dreamily, \"I wonder if wolves can ring doorbells?\" \"What?\" Paul turned to look straight at her. \"Has it ever occurred to you,\" he blurted, \"that you may not be paranoid after all? I mean, that something weird and uncanny really is out to get you?\" \"Very funny,\" Hannah whispered \"I mean-\" Paul gestured around the room, half-laughing. He looked punch-drunk. \"I mean, you said something was going to happen-and something did.\" He stopped laughing and looked at her with wondering speculation. \"You really did know, didn\u0027t you?\" Hannah glared at the man who was supposed to guide her back to sanity. \"Are you crazy?\" Paul blinked. He looked shocked and embarrassed, then he glanced away and shook his head. \"God, I don\u0027t know. Sorry; that wasn\u0027t very professional, was it? But...\" He stared out the window. \"Well, for a moment it just seemed possible that you\u0027ve got some kind of secret locked up there in your brain. Something... extraordinary.\" Hannah said nothing. She was trying to forget about too many things at once: the new part of her that whispered strategies, the wolves with human eyes, the silver picture frame. She had no idea what all these things added up to, and she didn\u0027t want to know. She wanted to force them away from her and go back to the safe ordinary world ofSacajaweaHigh School . Paul cleared his throat, still looking out the window. His voice was uncertain and almost apologetic. \"It can\u0027t be true, of course. There\u0027s got to be a rational explanation. But-well, if it were true, it occurs to me that somebody had better unlock that secret. Before something worse happens.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-2.html","bookId":2080,"book":{"id":2080,"title":"Night World : Soulmate (Night World #6)","description":"Storyline: Soulmate (Night World Book 6) Hannah Snow\u0027s life was perfect...until the notes started appearing.
