Do you\n know who you are?\"\n \"I\u0027m wet,\" Hannah said slowly, feeling dazed. She touched her face. Her hair was dripping. Paul was\n holding a water glass. \"Why am I wet?\"\n \"I had to wake you up.\" Paul sagged to the floor beside the couch. \"What\u0027s your name? What year is it?\"\n \"My name is Hannah Snow,\" Hannah said, still feeling dazed and bodiless. \"And it\u0027s-\" Suddenly memory\n rushed out of the fog at her. She sat bolt upright, tears starting to stream from her eyes. \"What was all\n that?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Paul whispered. He leaned his head against the couch, then looked up. \"You just kept\n talking-you were telling that story as if you\n were there. It was really happening to you. And nothing I could do would break the trance. I tried\n everything-I thought you were never going to come out of it. And then you started sobbing and I couldn\u0027t\n make you stop.\"\n \"I felt as if it were happening to me,\" Hannah said. Her head ached; her whole body felt bruised with\n tension. And she was reeling with memories that were perfectly real and perfectly hers... and\n impossible.\n \"That was like no past life regression I\u0027ve ever read about,\" Paul said, his voice agitated. \"The detail...\n you knew everything. Have you ever studied-is there any way you could have known those kinds of\n things?\"\n \"No.\" Hannah was just as agitated, \"I\u0027ve never studied humans in the Stone Age-and this was real. It\n wasn\u0027t something I was making up as I was going along.\"\n They were both talking at once. \"That guy,\" Paul was saying. \"He\u0027s the one you\u0027re afraid of, isn\u0027t he? But,\n look, you know, regression is one thing... past lives is another thing... but this is crazy.\"\n \"I don\u0027t believe in vampires,\" Hannah was saying at the same time. \"Because that\u0027s what that guy was\n supposed to be, wasn\u0027t it? Of course it was. Caveman vampire. He was probably the first one. And I\n don\u0027t believe in reincarnation.\"\n \"Just plain crazy. This is crazy.\"\n \"I agree.\"\n They both took a breath, looking at each other. There was a long silence.\n Hannah put a hand to her forehead. \"I\u0027m ... really tired.\"\n \"Yeah. Yeah, I can understand that.\" Paul looked around the room, nodded twice, then got up. \"Well,\n we\u0027d better get you home. We can talk about all this later, figure out what it really means. Some kind of\n subconscious fixation... archetypical symbolism... something.\" He ran out of air and shook his head.\n \"Now, you feel all right, don\u0027t you? And you\u0027re not going to worry about this? Because there\u0027s nothing to\n worry about.\"\n \"I know. I know.\"\n \"At least we know we don\u0027t have to worry about vampires attacking you.\" He laughed. The laugh was\n strained.\n Hannah couldn\u0027t manage even a smile.\n There was a brief silence, then Paul said, \"You know, I think I\u0027ll drive you home. That would be good.\n That would be a good idea.\"\n \"That would be fine,\" Hannah whispered.\n He held out a hand to help her off the couch. \"By the way, I\u0027m really sorry I had to get you all wet.\"\n \"No. It was good you did. I was feeling so awful- and there were worse things about to happen.\"\n Paul blinked. \"I\u0027m sorry?\"\n Hannah looked at him helplessly, then away. \"There were worse things about to happen. Terrible things.\n Really, really awful things.\"\n \"How do you know that?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. But there were.\"\n Paul walked her to her doorstep. And Hannah was glad of it.\n Once inside the house, she went straight down the hall to her mother\u0027s study. It was a cluttered\n comfortable room with books piled on the floor and the tools\n of a paleontologist scattered around. Her mother was at her desk, bending over a microscope.\n \"Is that you, Hannah?\" she asked without looking up. \"I\u0027ve got some marvelous sections of haversian\n canals in duckbill bones. Want to see?\"\n \"Oh... not now. Maybe later,\" Hannah said. She wanted very much to tell her mother about what had\n happened, but something was stopping her. Her mother was so sensible, so practical and intelligent....\n She\u0027ll think I\u0027m crazy. And she\u0027ll be right. And then she\u0027ll be appalled, wondering how she could have\n given birth to an insane daughter.\n That was an exaggeration, and Hannah knew it, but somehow she still couldn\u0027t bring herself to tell. Since\n her father had died five years ago, she and her mother had been almost like friends-but that didn\u0027t mean\n she didn\u0027t want her mother\u0027s approval. She did. She desperately wanted her mother to be proud of her,\n and to realize that she could handle things on her own.\n It had been the same with the notes-she\u0027d never told about finding them. For all her mom knew,\n Hannah\u0027s only problem was bad dreams.\n \"So how did it go tonight?\" her mother asked now, eye still to the microscope. \"That Dr. Winfield is so\n young-I hope he\u0027s not too inexperienced.\"\n Last chance. Take it or lose it. \"Uh, it went fine,\" Hannah said weakly.\n \"That\u0027s good. There\u0027s chicken in the crockpot. I\u0027ll be out in a little while; I just want to finish this.\"\n \"Okay. Great. Thanks.\" Hannah turned and stumbled out, completely frustrated with herself.\n You know Mom won\u0027t really be awful, she scolded\n herself as she fished a piece of chicken out of the crockpot. So tell her. Or call Chess and tell her.\n They\u0027ll make things better. They\u0027ll tell you how impossible all this stuff about vampires and past lives is. ...\n Yes, and that\u0027s the problem. Hannah sat frozen, holding a fork with a bite of chicken on it motionless in\n front of her.\n I don\u0027t believe in vampires or reincarnation. But I know what I saw. I know things about Hana . ., things\n that weren\u0027t even in the story I told Paul. I know she wore a tunic and leggings of roe deer hide. I know\n she ate wild cattle and wild boar and salmon and hazel nuts. I know she made tools out of elk antler and\n deer bone and flint.... God, I could pick up a flint cobble and knock off a set of blades and scrapers\n right now. I know I could. I can feel how to in my hands.\n She put the fork down and looked at her hands. They were shaking slightly.\n And I know she had a beautiful singing voice, a voice like crystal....\n Like the crystal voice in my mind.\n So what do I do when they tell me it\u0027s impossible? Argue with them? Then I\u0027ll really be crazy, like those\n people in institutions who think they\u0027re Napoleon or Cleopatra.\n God, I hope I haven\u0027t been Cleopatra.\n Half laughing and half crying, she put her face in her hands.\n And what about him?\n The blond stranger with the bottomless eyes. The guy Hana didn\u0027t have a name for, but Hannah knew as\n Thierry.\n If the rest of it is real, what about him?\n He\u0027s the one I\u0027m afraid of, Hannah thought. But he didn\u0027t seem so bad. Dangerous, but not evil. So why\n do I think of him as evil?\n And why do I want him anyway?\n Because she did want him. She remembered the feelings of Hana standing next to the stranger in the\n moonlight. Confusion... fear... and attraction. That magnetism between them. The extraordinary things\n that happened when he touched her hand.\n He came to the Three Rivers and turned her life upside down.... The Three Rivers. Oh, God-why\n didn\u0027t I think of that before? The note. One of the notes said \"Remember the Three Rivers.\"\n Okay. So I\u0027ve remembered it. So what now?\n She had no idea. Maybe she was supposed to understand everything now, and know what to do ... but\n she didn\u0027t. She was more confused than ever.\n Of course, a tiny voice like a cool dark wind in her brain said, you didn\u0027t remember all of it yet. Did you?\n Paul woke you up before you got to the end.\n Shut up, Hannah told the voice.\n But she couldn\u0027t stop thinking. All night she was restless, moving from one room to another, avoiding her\n mother\u0027s questions. And even after her mother went to bed, Hannah found herself wandering aimlessly\n through the house, straightening things, picking up books and putting them down again.\n I\u0027ve got to sleep. That\u0027s the only thing that will help me feel better, she thought. But she couldn\u0027t make\n herself sit, much less lie down.\n Maybe I need some air.\n It was a strange thought. She\u0027d never actually felt the need to go outside for the sole purpose of\n breathing fresh air-in Montana you did that all day long.\n But there was something pulling at her, drawing her to go outside. It was like a compulsion and she\n couldn\u0027t resist.\n I\u0027ll just go on the back porch. Of course there\u0027s nothing to be scared of out there. And if I go outside,\n then I\u0027ll prove there isn\u0027t, and then I can go to sleep.\n Without stopping to consider the logic of this, she opened the back door.\n It was a beautiful night. The moon threw a silver glow over everything and the horizon seemed very far\n away. Hannah\u0027s backyard blended into the wild bluestem and pine grass of the prairie. The wind carried\n the clean pungent smell of sage.\n We\u0027ll have spring flowers soon, Hannah thought. Asters and bluebells and little golden buttercups.\n Everything will be green for a while. Spring\u0027s a time for life, not death.\n And I was right to come out. I feel more relaxed now. I can go back inside and lie down....\n It was at that moment that she realized she was being watched.\n It was the same feeling she\u0027d been having for weeks, the feeling that there were eyes in the darkness and\n they were fixed on her. Chills of adrenaline ran through Hannah\u0027s body.\n Don\u0027t panic, she told herself. It\u0027s just a feeling. There\u0027s probably nothing out here.\n She took a slow step backward toward the door. She didn\u0027t want to move too quickly. She had the\n irrational certainty that if she turned and ran, whatever was watching her would spring out and get her\n before she got the door open.\n At the same time she edged backward, her eyes and ears were straining so hard that she saw gray\n spots and she heard a thin ringing. She was trying, desperately, to catch some sign of movement, some\n sound. But everything was still and the only noises were the normal distant noises of the outdoors.\n Then she saw the shadow.\n Black against the lighter blackness of the night, it was moving among the bluestem grass. And it was big.\n Tall. Not a cat or other small animal. Big as a person.\n It was coming toward her.\n Hannah thought she might faint.\n Don\u0027t be ridiculous, a sharp voice in her head told her. Get inside. You\u0027re standing here in the light from\n the windows; you\u0027re a perfect target. Get inside fast and lock the door.\n Hannah whirled, and knew even as she did it that she wouldn\u0027t be fast enough. It was going to jump at\n her exposed back. It was going to ...\n \"Wait,\" came a voice out of the darkness. \"Please. Wait.\"\n A male voice. Unfamiliar. But it seemed to grab Hannah and hold her still.\n \"I won\u0027t hurt you. I promise.\"\n Runrunrunrun! Hannah\u0027s mind told her.\n Very slowly, one hand on the door knob, she turned around.\n She watched the dark figure coming out of the shadows to her. She didn\u0027t try to get away again. She\n Had a dizzying feeling that fate had caught up with her.\n The ground sloped, so the light from the house windows showed her his boots first, then the legs of his\n jeans. Normal walking boots like any Montanan might wear. Ordinary jeans-long legs. He was tall.\n Then the light showed his shirt, which was an ordinary T-shirt, a little cold to be walking around at night\n in, but nothing startling. And then his shoulders, which were nice ones.\n Then, as he stepped to the base of the porch, she saw his face.\n He looked better than when she had seen him last. His white-blond hair wasn\u0027t crazily messed up; it fell\n neatly over his forehead. He wasn\u0027t splattered with mud and his eyes weren\u0027t wild. They were dark and\n so endlessly sad that it was like a knife in the heart just to see him.\n But it was unmistakably the boy from her hypnosis session.\n \"Oh, God,\" Hannah said. \"Oh, God.\" Her knees were giving out.\n It\u0027s real. It\u0027s real. He\u0027s real and that means... it\u0027s all true.\n \"Oh, God.\" She was trembling violently and she had to put pressure on her knees to keep standing. The\n world was changing around her, and it was the most disorienting thing she\u0027d ever experienced. It was as if\n the fabric of her universe was actually moving-pulsing and shifting to accommodate the new truths.\n Nothing was ever going to be the same again.\n \"Are you all right?\" The stranger moved toward her and Hannah recoiled instinctively.\n \"Don\u0027t touch me!\" she gasped, and at the same moment her legs gave out. She slid to the floor of the\n porch and stared at the boy whose face was now approximately level with hers.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he almost whispered. \"I know what\n you\u0027re going through. You\u0027re just realizing now, aren\u0027t you?\"\n Hannah said, whispering to herself, \"It\u0027s all true.\"\n \"Yes.\" The dark eyes were so sad.\n \"It\u0027s... I\u0027ve had past lives.\"\n \"Yes.\" He squatted on the ground, looking down as if he couldn\u0027t keep staring at her face anymore. He\n picked up a pebble, examined it. Hannah noticed that his fingers were long and sensitive-looking.\n \"You\u0027re an Old Soul,\" he said quietly. \"You\u0027ve had lots of lives.\"\n \"I was Hana of the Three Rivers.\"\n His fingers stopped rolling the pebble. \"Yes.\"\n \"And you\u0027re Thierry. And you\u0027re a ...\"\n He didn\u0027t look up. \"Go on. Say it.\"\n Hannah couldn\u0027t. Her voice wouldn\u0027t form the word.\n The stranger-Thierry-said it for her. \"Vampires are real.\" A glance from those unfathomable eyes. \"I\u0027m\n sorry.\"\n Hannah breathed and looked down at him. But the world had finished its reshaping. Her mind was\n beginning to work again.\n At least I know I\u0027m not crazy, she thought. That\u0027s some consolation. It\u0027s the universe that\u0027s insane, not\n me.\n And now I have to deal with it-somehow.\n She said quietly, \"Are you going to kill me now?\"\n \"God-no!\" He stood up fast, uncoiling. Shock was naked on his face. \"You don\u0027t understand. I would\n never hurt you. I ...\" He broke off. \"It\u0027s hard to know where to begin.\"\n Hannah sat silently, while he looked around the porch for inspiration. She could feel her heart beating in\n her throat. She\u0027d told Paul that this boy had killed her, kept killing her. But his look of shock had been so\n genuine-as if she\u0027d hurt him terribly by even suggesting it.\n \"I suppose I should start by explaining exactly what I am,\" he said. \"And what I\u0027ve done. I made you\n come outside tonight. I influenced you. I didn\u0027t want to do it, but I had to talk to you.\"\n \"Influenced me?\"\n It\u0027s a mental thing. I can also just communicate this way. It was his voice, but his lips weren\u0027t moving.\n And it was the same voice she\u0027d heard at the end of her hypnotic session, the voice that wasn\u0027t Paul\u0027s.\n The one that had spoken in her head, saying, Hannah, come back. You don\u0027t have to relive this.\n \"You were the one who woke me up,\" Hannah whispered. \"I wouldn\u0027t have come back except for you.\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t stand to see you hurting like that.\"\n Can somebody with his eyes be evil?\n He was obviously a different sort of creature than she was, and every move he made showed the grace\n of a predator. It reminded her of how the wolves had moved-they had rippled. He did, too, his muscles\n moving so lightly under his skin. He was unnatural- but beautiful.\n Something struck her. \"The wolves. I picked up a silver picture frame to bash them with. Silver.\" She\n looked at him. \"Werewolves are real.\" At the last moment her voice made it a statement instead of a\n question.\n \"So much is real that you don\u0027t know about. Or that you haven\u0027t remembered yet. You were starting\n to remember with that shrink. You said I was a Lord of the Night World.\"\n The Night World. Just the mention of it sent prickles through Hannah. She could almost remember, but\n not quite.\n And she knew it was crazy to be kneeling here having this conversation. She was talking to a vampire. A\n guy who drank blood for a living. A guy whose every gesture showed he was a hunter. And not only a\n vampire, but the person her subconscious had been warning her about for weeks. Telling her to be afraid,\n be very afraid.\n So why wasn\u0027t she running? For one thing, she didn\u0027t think her legs would physically support her. And\n for another-well, somehow she couldn\u0027t stop looking at him.\n \"One of the werewolves was mine,\" he was saying quietly. \"She was here to find you-and protect you.\n But the other one... Hannah, you have to understand. I\u0027m not the only one looking for you.\"\n To protect me. So I was right, Hannah thought. The gray female was on my side. She said, \"Who else is\n looking?\"\n \"Another Night Person.\" He looked away. \"Another vampire.\"\n \"Am I a Night Person?\"\n \"No. You\u0027re a human.\" He said it the way he said everything, as if reminding her of terrible facts he\n wished he didn\u0027t have to bring up. \"Old Souls are just humans who keep coming back.\"\n \"How many times have I come back?\"\n \"I ... I\u0027d have to think about it. Quite a few.\"\n \"And have you been with me in all of them?\"\n \"Any of them I could manage.\"\n \"What do the rest of the notes mean?\" Hannah had been gathering speed, and now she was shooting\n questions at him in machine-gun fashion. She thought she was in control, and she hardly noticed the\n hysterical edge to her own voice. \"Why am I telling myself I\u0027ll be dead before I\u0027m seventeen?\"\n \"Hannah...\" He reached out a hand to calm her.\n Hannah\u0027s own hand moved by reflex, coming up to ward his off. And then their fingers touched, bare\n skin to bare skin, and the world disappeared. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-6.html","bookId":2080,"book":{"id":2080,"title":"Night World : Soulmate (Night World #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Soulmate (Night World Book 6) \n Hannah Snow\u0027s life was perfect...until the notes started appearing.
