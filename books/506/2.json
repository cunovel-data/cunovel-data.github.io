{"id":21685,"no":2,"title":"AT TEAGUE POTEET\u0027S. A SKETCH OF THE HOG MOUNTAIN RANGE","content":"EMMIGRATION is a much more serious matter than revolution. Virtually, it is obliteration. Thus, Gérard Petit, landing upon the coast of South Carolina in the days of French confusion—a period covering too many dates for a romancer to be at all choice in the matter—gave his wife and children over to the oblivion of a fatal fever. Turning his face westward, he pushed his way to the mountains. He had begun his journey fired with the despair of an exile, and he ended it with something of the energy and enterprise of a pioneer. In the foot-hills of the mountains he came to the small stream of English colonists that was then trickling slowly southward through the wonderful valleys that stretch from Pennsylvania to Georgia, between the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge and the great Cumberland Range. Here, perhaps for the first time, the je, vous, nous of France met in conflict the \"ah yi,\" the \"we uns\" and the \"you uns\" of the English-Pennsylvania-Georgians. The conflict was brief. There was but one Gérard Petit, and, although he might multiply the je, vous, nous by the thousands and hundreds of thousands, as he undoubtedly did, yet, in the very nature of things, the perpetual volley of \"you uns\" and \"we uns\" must carry the day. They belonged to the time, and the climate suited them. By degrees they fitted themselves to Gérard Petit; they carried him from the mountains of South Carolina to the mountains of North Georgia, and there they helped him to build a mill and found a family. But their hospitality did not end there. With the new mill and the new family, they gave him a new name. Gérard Petit, presumably with his hand upon his heart, as became his race, made one last low bow to genealogy. In his place stood Jerd Poteet, \"you uns\" to the left of him, \"we uns\" to the right of him. He made such protest as he might. He brought his patriotism to bear upon the emergency, and named his eldest son Huguenin Petit. How long this contest between hospitality on the one hand and family pride and patriotism on the other was kept up it is unnecessary to inquire. It is enough to say that the Huguenin of one generation, left Hugue Poteet as his son and heir; Hugue left Hague, and this Hague, or a succeeding one, by some mysterious development of fate, left Teague Poteet. Meanwhile the restless stream of English-Pennsylvania-Georgians, with its \"you uns\" and its \"we uns,\" trickled over into Alabama, where some of the Petits who were carried with it became Pettys and Pettises. The Georgia settlements, however, had been reinforced by Virginians, South Carolinians, and Georgians. The gold excitement brought some; while others, set adrift by the exigencies of the plantation system, found it easier and cheaper to get to North Georgia than to reach Louisiana or Mississippi. Thus, in 1859, Teague Poteet, a young man of thirty or thereabouts, was tilling, in a half-serious, half-jocular way, a small farm on Hog Mountain, in full view of Gullettsville. That is to say, Poteet could see the whole of Gullettsville, but Gullettsville could not, by any means, see the whole, nor even the half, of Poteet\u0027s fifty-acre farm. Gullettsville could see what appeared to be a grey notch on the side of the mountain, from which a thin stream of blue smoke flowed upward and melted into the blue of the sky, and this was about all that could be seen. Gullettsville had the advantage in this, that it was the county-seat. A country-road, straggling in from the woods, straggled around a barn-like structure called the court- house, and then straggled off to some other remote and lonely settlement. Upon rare occasions Teague made his appearance on this straggling street, and bought his dram and paid his thrip for it; but, in a general way, if Gullettsville wanted to see him, it had to search elsewhere than on the straggling street. By knocking the sheriff of the county over the head with a chair, and putting a bullet through a saloon-keeper who bullied everybody, Poteet won the reputation of being a man of marked shrewdness and common sense, and Gullettsville was proud of him, in a measure. But he never liked Gullettsville. He wore a wool hat, a homespun shirt, jeans pantaloons, and cotton suspenders, and he never could bring himself into thorough harmony with the young men who wore ready-made clothes, starched shirts, and beaver hats; nor was his ideal of feminine beauty reached by the village belles, with their roach-combs, their red and yellow ribbons, and their enormous flounces. In the mountains, he was to the manner born; in the village, he was keenly alive to the presence and pressure of the exclusiveness that is the basis of all society, good, bad, or indifferent; and it stirred his venom. His revolt was less pronounced and less important than that of his ancestors; but it was a revolt. Gérard Petit left France, and Teague Poteet remained away from Gullettsville. Otherwise there was scarcely a trace of his lineage about him, and it is a question whether he inherited this trait from France or from the Euphrates—from Gérard or from Adam. But he did not become a hermit by any means. The young men of Gullettsville made Sunday excursions to his farm, and he was pleased to treat them with great deference. Moreover, he began to go upon little journeys of his own across Sugar Valley. He made no mystery of his intentions; but one day there was considerable astonishment when he rode into Gullettsville on horseback, with Puss Pringle behind him, and informed the proper authorities of his desire to make her Mrs. Puss Poteet. Miss Pringle was not a handsome woman, but she was a fair representative of that portion of the race that has poisoned whole generations by improving the frying-pan and perpetuating \"fatty bread.\" The impression she made upon those who saw her for the first time was one of lank flatness—to convey a vivid idea rather clumsily. But she was neither lank nor flat. The total absence of all attempts at artificial ornamentation gave the future Mrs. Poteet an appearance of forlorn shiftlessness that was not even slightly justified by the facts. She was a woman past the heyday of youth, but of considerable energy, and possessed of keen powers of observation. Whatever was feminine about her was of that plaintive variety which may be depended upon to tell the story of whole generations of narrow, toilsome, and unprofitable lives. There was one incident connected with Miss Pringle\u0027s antenuptial ride that rather intensified the contempt which the Mountain entertained for the Valley. As she jogged down the street, clinging confidently, if not comfortably, to Teague Poteet\u0027s suspenders, two young ladies of Gullettsville chanced to be passing along. They walked slowly, their arms twined about each other\u0027s waists. They wore white muslin dresses, and straw hats with wide and jaunty brims, and the loose ends of gay ribbons fluttered about them. These young ladies, fresh from school, and no doubt full of vainglory, greeted the bridal procession with a little explosion of giggles, and when Puss Pringle pushed back her gingham sun-bonnet and innocently gazed upon them, they turned up their noses, sniffed the air scornfully, and made such demonstrations as no feminine mind, however ignorant in other directions, could fail to interpret. Miss Pringle had not learned the art of tossing her head and sniffing the air, but she half closed her eyes and gave the young ladies a look that meant something more than scorn. She said nothing to Teague, for she was in hopes he had not observed the tantrums of the school-girls. As for Teague, he saw the whole affair, and was out to the quick. In addition to the latent pride of his class, he inherited the sensitiveness of his ancestors, but, turning his eyes neither to the right nor to the left, he jogged along to the wedding. He carried his wife home, and thereafter avoided Gullettsville. When he was compelled to buy coffee and sugar, or other necessary luxuries, he rode forty miles across the mountain to Villa Bay. He had been married a year or more when, one afternoon, he was compelled to ride down to Gullettsville under whip and spur for a doctor. There was a good deal of confused activity in the town. Old men and young boys were stirring around with blue cockades in their hats, and the women wore blue rosettes on their bosoms. Three negroes in uniform—a contribution from the nearest railroad town—were parading up and down the straggling street with fife and drums, and a number of men were planting a flag-pole in front of the court-house. No conscientious historian can afford to ignore a coincidence, and it so happened that upon the very day that league Poteet\u0027s wife presented him with the puzzle of a daughter, Fate presented his countrymen with the problem of war. That night, sitting in the door of his house and smoking his pipe, Teague witnessed other developments of the coincidence. In the next room the baby-girl squalled most persistently; down in the valley the premonitions of war made themselves heard through the narrow throat of a small cannon which, until then, had been used only to celebrate the Fourth of July. The noise of a horse\u0027s hoofs roused Teague\u0027s hounds, and some one called out from the road— \"Hello, Poteet!\" \"Ah-yi!\" \"You hearn the racket?\" \"My gal-baby keeps up sich a hollerin\u0027 I can\u0027t hear my own years.\" \"Oh!\" \"You better b\u0027lieve! Nine hours ole, an\u0027 mighty peart. What\u0027s them Restercrats in the valley cuttin\u0027 up the\u0027r scollops fer?\" \"Whoopin\u0027 up sesaysion. Sou\u0027 Ca\u0027liny done plum gone out, an\u0027 Georgy a-gwine.\" Teague Poteet blew a long, thin cloud of home-made tobacco-smoke heavenward, leaned back heavily in his chair, and replied— \"Them air Restercrats kin go wher\u0027 they dang please; I\u0027m a-gwine to stay right slambang in the United States.\" There was a little pause, as if the man on horseback was considering the matter. Then the response came— \"Here\u0027s at you!\" \"Can\u0027t you \u0027light?\" asked Poteet. \"Not now,\" said the other; \"I\u0027ll git on furder.\" The man on horseback rode on across the mountain to his home. Another mountaineer, seeing the rockets and hearing the sound of the cannon, came down to Poteet\u0027s for information. He leaned over the brush- fence. \"What\u0027s up, Teague?\" \"Gal-baby; reg\u0027lar surbinder.\" \"Shoo! won\u0027t my ole \u0027oman holler! What\u0027s up down yan?\" \"Them dad-blasted Restercrats a secedin\u0027 out\u0027n the United States.\" \"They say theyer airter savin\u0027 of the\u0027r niggers,\" said the man at the fence. \"Well, I hain\u0027t got none, and I hain\u0027t a wantin\u0027 none; an\u0027 it hain\u0027t been ten minnits sence I ups an\u0027 says to Dave Hightower, s\u0027 I, \u0027The United States is big enough for me.\u0027\" \"Now you er makin\u0027 the bark fly,\" said the man at the fence. During the night other men came down the mountain as far as Poteet\u0027s, and always with the same result. The night broadened into day, and other days and nights followed. In the valley the people had their problem of war, and on the mountain Teague Poteet had the puzzle of his daughter. One was full of doubt and terror, and death, and the other full of the pleasures of peace. As the tide of war surged nearer and nearer, and the demand for recruits became clamorous, the people of the valley bethought them of the gaunt but sturdy men who lived on the mountain. A conscript officer, representing the necessities of a new government, made a journey thither —a little excursion full of authority and consequence. As he failed to return, another officer, similarly equipped and commissioned, rode forth and disappeared, and then another and another; and it was not until a little search expedition had been fitted out that the Confederates discovered that the fastnesses of Hog Mountain concealed a strong and dangerous organisation of union men. There was a good deal of indignation in the valley when this state of affairs became known, and there was some talk of organising a force for the purpose of driving the mountaineers away from their homes. But somehow the Valley never made up its mind to attack the Mountain, and, upon such comfortable terms as these, the Mountain was very glad to let the Valley alone. After a while the Valley had larger troubles to contend with. Gullettsville became in some measure a strategic point, and the left wing of one army and the right wing of the other manoeuvred for possession. The left wing finally gave way, and the right wing marched in and camped round about, introducing to the distracted inhabitants General Tecumseh Sherman and some of his lieutenants. The right wing had learned that a number of union men were concealed on the mountain, and one or two little excursion parties were made up for the purpose of forming their acquaintance. These excursions were successful to this extent, that some of the members thereof returned to the friendly shelter of the right wing with bullet-holes in them, justly feeling that they had been outraged. The truth is, the Poteets, and the Pringles, and the Hightowers of Hog Mountain had their own notions of what constituted union men. They desired to stay in the United States on their own terms. If nobody pestered them, they pestered nobody. Meanwhile league Poteet\u0027s baby had grown to be a thumping girl, and hardly a day passed that she did not accompany her father in his excursions. When the contending armies came in sight, Teague and his comrades spent a good deal of their time in watching them. Each force passed around an elbow of the mountain, covering a distance of nearly sixty miles, and thus for days and weeks this portentous panorama was spread out before these silent watchers. Surely never before did a little girl have two armies for her playthings. The child saw the movements of the soldiers, the glitter of the array, and the waving of the banners; she heard the dull thunder of the cannon, and the sharp rattle of the musketry. When the sun went down, and the camp-fire shone out, it seemed that ten thousand stars had fallen at her feet, and sometimes sweet strains of music stole upward on the wings of the night, and slipped heavenward through the sighing pines. The grey columns swung right and left, and slowly fell back; the blue columns swayed right and left, and slowly pressed forward—sometimes beneath clouds of sulphurous smoke, sometimes beneath heavy mists of rain, sometimes in the bright sunshine. They swung and swayed slowly out of sight, and Hog Mountain and Gullettsville were left at peace. The child grew and thrived. In the midst of a gaunt and sallow generation she shone radiantly beautiful. In some mysterious way she inherited the beauty, and grace, and refinement of a Frenchwoman. Merely as a phenomenon, she ought to have reminded league of his name and lineage; but Teague had other matters to think of. \"Sis ain\u0027t no dirt-eater,\" he used to say, and to this extent only would he commit himself, his surroundings having developed in him that curious excess of caution and reserve which characterises his class. As for Puss Poteet, she sat and rocked herself and rubbed snuff, and regarded her daughter as one of the profound mysteries. She was in a state of perpetual bewilderment and surprise, equalled only by her apparent indifference. She allowed herself to be hustled around by Sis without serious protest, and submitted, as Teague did, to the new order of things as quietly as possible. Meanwhile the people in the valley were engaged in adjusting themselves to the changed condition of affairs. The war was over, but it had left some deep scars here and there, and those who had engaged in it gave their attention to healing these—a troublesome and interminable task, be it said, which by no means kept pace with the impatience of the victors, whipped into fury by the subtle but ignoble art of the politician. There was no lack of despair in the valley, but out of it all prosperity grew, and the promise of a most remarkable future. Behind the confusion of politics, of one sort and another, the spirit of Progress rose and shook her ambitious wings. Something of all this must have made itself felt on the mountain, for one day Teague Poteet pushed his wide-brimmed wool hat from over his eyes, with an air of astonishment. Puss had just touched upon a very important matter. \"I reckon in reason,\" she said, \"we oughter pack Sis off to school some\u0027rs. She\u0027ll thes nat\u0027ally spile here.\" \"Hain\u0027t you larnt her how to read an\u0027 write an\u0027 cipher?\" asked Teague. \"I started in,\" said Mrs. Poteet, \"but, Lord! I hain\u0027t more\u0027n opened a book tell she know\u0027d mor\u0027n I dast to know ef I wuz gwine to die fer it. Hit\u0027ll take somebody lots smarter\u0027n\u0027 stronger\u0027n me.\" Teague laughed, and then relapsed into seriousness. After a while he called Sis. The girl came running in, her dark eyes flashing, her black hair bewitchingly tangled, and her cheeks flushing with a colour hitherto unknown to the mountain. \"What now, pap?\" \"I wuz thes a-thinkin\u0027 ef maybe you oughtn\u0027t to bresh up an\u0027 start to school down in Gullettsville.\" \"O pap!\" the girl exclaimed, clapping her hands with delight. She was about to spring upon Teague and give him a severe hugging, when suddenly her arms dropped to her side, the flush died out of her face, and she flopped herself down upon a chair. Teague paid no attention to this. \"Yes, siree,\" he continued, as if pursuing a well-developed line of argument; \"when a gal gits ez big ez you is, she hain\u0027t got no business to be a-gwine a-whoopin\u0027 an\u0027 a-hollerin\u0027 an\u0027 a-rantin\u0027 an\u0027 a-rompin\u0027 acrost the face er the yeth. The time\u0027s done come when they oughter be tuck up an\u0027 made a lady out\u0027n; an\u0027 the nighest way is to sen\u0027 \u0027em to school. That\u0027s whar you a-gwine—down to Gullettsville to school.\" \"I shan\u0027t, an\u0027 I won\u0027t—I won\u0027t, I won\u0027t, I won\u0027t!\" exclaimed Sis, clenching her hands and stamping her feet. \"I\u0027ll die first.\" Teague had never seen her so excited, \"Why, what\u0027s the matter, Sis?\" he asked with unfeigned concern. Sis gave him a withering look. \"Pap, do you reckon I\u0027m fool enough to traipse down to Gullettsville an\u0027 mix with them people, wearin\u0027 cloze like these? Do you reckon I\u0027m fool enough to make myself the laughin\u0027-stock for them folks?\" Teague Poteet was not a learned man, but he was shrewd enough to see that the Mountain had a new problem to solve. He took down his rifle, whistled up his dogs, and tramped skyward. As he passed out through his horse-lot, a cap and worm of a whisky-still lying in the corner of the fence attracted his attention. He paused, and turned the apparatus over with his foot. It was old and somewhat battered. \"I\u0027ll thes about take you,\" said Teague, with a chuckle, \"an\u0027 set up a calico-factory. I\u0027ll heat you up an\u0027 make you spin silk an\u0027 split it into ribbens.\" It was a case of civilisation or no civilisation, and there is nothing more notorious in history—nothing more mysterious—than the fact that civilisation is not over-nice in the choice of her handmaidens. One day it is war, another it is slavery. Every step in the advancement of the human race has a paradox of some kind as a basis. In the case of Sis Poteet, it was whisky. Teague got his still together and planted it in a nice cool place, where it could be reached only by a narrow footpath. He had set up a still immediately after the war, but it had been promptly broken up by the revenue officers. Upon this occasion, therefore, he made elaborate preparations to guard against surprise and detection, and these preparations bore considerable fruit in the way of illicit whisky; the ultimate result of which was that Sis went to school in Gullettsville, and became the belle of the town. The breath of the mountain was heavily charged with whisky, and the Government got a whiff of it. Word went to Washington, and there was much writing and consulting by mail, and some telegraphing. The officials—marshal, deputy-marshals, and collector—were mostly men from a distance, brought hither on the tide of war, who had no personal interest in judging the situation. Naturally enough, the power with which they were invested was neither discreetly nor sympathetically exercised. They represented the Government, which, they were taught to believe by the small men above them, was still at war with every condition and belief in Georgia. Down in the valley they domineered with impunity, and one fine morning a posse, armed with carbines, rode up the mountain, laughing, talking, and rattling their gear as gaily as a detachment of cuirassiers parading under the protection of friendly guns. The mountain was inhospitable, for when they rode down again, a few hours afterward, three saddles were empty, and the survivors had a terrible story to tell of an attack from an unseen foe. By the time the story of this fight with the illicit distillers reached Washington, the details were considerably enlarged. The commissioner was informed by the marshal that a detail of deputy-marshals had attempted to seize a still, and were driven back by an overpowering force. The correspondents at the Capital still further enlarged the details, and the affair finally went into history as \"A New Phase of the Rebellion.\" This was the natural outgrowth of the confusion of that period; for how should the careless deputy-marshals, thinking only of the sectionalism that lit up the smouldering ruins of war, know that the Moonshiners were union men and Republicans? While the Government was endeavouring to invent some plan for the capture of the Moonshiners, Sis Poteet was growing lovelier every day. She was a great favourite with the teachers of the academy and with everybody. As a general thing, she avoided the public square when riding to and from the school, but it was hats off with all the men when she did go clattering down the street, and some of the romantic dry-goods clerks sent their sighs after her. Sighs are frequently very effective with school-girls, but those that followed Sis Poteet fell short and were wasted on the air; and she continued to ride from the mountain to the valley and from the valley to the mountain in profound ignorance of the daily sensation she created among the young men of Gullettsville, to whom her fine figure, her graceful ways, and her thrillingly beautiful face were the various manifestations of a wonderful revelation. Naturally enough, the Government took no account of Sis Poteet. The commissioner at Washington conferred with the marshal for Georgia by mail, and begged him to exert himself to the utmost to break up the business of illicit distilling in the Hog Mountain Range. In view of an important election about to be held in some doubtful State in the North or West, the worthy commissioner at Washington even suggested the propriety of another armed raid, to be made up of deputy-marshals and a detachment of men from the Atlanta garrison. But the marshal for Georgia did not fall in with this suggestion. He was of the opinion that if a raid was to be made at all it should not be made blindly, and he fortified his opinion with such an array of facts and arguments that the Bureau finally left the whole matter to his discretion. Early one morning, in the summer of 1879, a stranger on horseback rode up the straggling red road that formed the principal business thoroughfare of Gullettsville, and made his way toward the establishment known as the Gullettsville Hotel. The chief advertisement of the hotel was the lack of one. A tall worm-eaten post stood in front of the building, but the frame in which the sign had swung was empty. This post, with its empty frame, was as significant as the art of blazonry could have made it. At any rate, the stranger on horseback—a young man—pressed forward without hesitation. The proprietor himself, Squire Lemuel Pleasants, was standing upon the low piazza as the young man rode up. The squire wore neither coat nor hat. His thumbs were caught behind his suspenders, giving him an air of ease or of defiance, as one might choose to interpret, and his jaws were engaged in mashing into shape the first quid of the morning. As the young man reined up his horse at the door, Squire Pleasants stepped briskly inside and pulled a string which communicated with a bell somewhere in the backyard. \"This is the Gullettsville Hotel, is it not?\" the young man asked. \"Well, sir,\" responded the squire, rubbing his hands together, \"sence you push me so clos\u0027t, I\u0027ll not deny that this here\u0027s the tavern. Some calls it the hotel, some calls it the Pleasants House, some one thing, an\u0027 some another, but as for me, I says to all, says I, \u0027Boys, it\u0027s a plain tavern.\u0027 In Fergeenia, sir, in my young days, they wa\u0027n\u0027t nothin\u0027 better than a tavern. \u0027Light, sir, \u0027light,\" continued the hospitable squire, as a tow-headed stable-boy tumbled out at the door in response to the bell; \"drap right down an\u0027 come in.\" The young man followed the landlord into a bare little office, where he was given to understand in plain terms that people who stopped with Squire Pleasants were expected to make themselves completely at home. With a pen upon which the ink had been dry for many a day the young man inscribed his name on a thin and dirty register—\"Philip Woodward, Clinton, Georgia;\" whereupon the squire, with unnecessary and laborious formality, assigned Mr. Woodward to a room. Judging from appearance, the United States Marshal for Georgia had not gone astray in selecting Woodward to carry out the delicate mission of arranging for a successful raid upon Hog Mountain. Lacking any distinguishing trait of refinement or culture, his composure suggested the possession of that necessary information which is the result of contact with the world and its inhabitants. He had that large air of ease and tranquillity which is born of association, and which represents one of the prime elements of the curious quality we call personal magnetism. He was ready-witted, and full of the spirit of adventure. He was the owner of the title to a land-lot somewhere in the neighbourhood of Hog Mountain, and this land-lot was all that remained of an inheritance that had been swept away by the war. There was a tradition—perhaps only a rumour—among the Woodwards that the Hog Mountain land-lot covered a vein of gold, and to investigate this was a part of the young man\u0027s business in Gullettsville; entirely subordinate, however, to his desire to earn the salary attached to his position. The presence of a stranger at the hospitable tavern of Squire Pleasants attracted the attention of the old and young men of leisure, and the most of them gathered upon the long narrow piazza to discuss the matter. Uncle Jimmy Wright, the sage of the village, had inspected the name in the register and approved of it. He had heard of it before, and he proceeded to give a long and rambling account of whole generations of Woodwards. Jake Cohen, a pedlar, who with marevelous tact had fitted himself to the conditions of life and society in the moutains, and who was supposed to have some sort of connection with the traffice in \"blockade\" whisky, gravely inquired of Squire Pleasants if the new-comer had left any message for him. Doubtless the squire, or some one else, would have attempted a facetious reply to Mr. Watson; but just then a tall, gaunt, grey-haired, grizzly-bearded man stepped upon the piazza, and saluted the little gathering with an awkward wave of the hand. The not unkindly expression of his face was curiously heightened (or deepened) by the alertness of his eyes, which had the quizzical restlessness we sometimes see in the eyes of birds or animals. It was Teague Poteet, and the greetings he received were of the most effusive character. \"Howdy, boys, howdy!\" he said in response to the chorus. \"They hain\u0027t airy one er you gents kin split up a twenty-dollar chunk er greenbacks, is they?\" Tip Watson made a pretence of falling in a chair and fainting, but he immediately recovered, and said in a sepulchral whisper— \"Ef you find anybody dead, an\u0027 they ain\u0027t got no twenty-dollar bill on their person, don\u0027t come a-knockin\u0027 at my door. Lord!\" he continued, \"look at Cohen\u0027s upper lip a-trimblin\u0027. He wants to take that bill out somewheres an\u0027 hang it on a clothesline.\" \"Ow!\" exclaimed Cohen, \"yoost lizzen at date man! Date Teep Vatsen, he so foony as allt tern utter peoples put tergetter. Vait, Teague, vait! I chanche date pill right avay, terreckerly.\" But Teague was absorbed in some information which Squire Pleasants was giving him. \"He don\u0027t favour the gang,\" the squire was saying with emphasis, \"an\u0027 I\u0027ll be boun\u0027 he ain\u0027t much mixed up wi\u0027 \u0027em. He\u0027s another cut. Oh, they ain\u0027t a-foolin\u0027 me this season of the year,\" he continued, as Teague Poteet shook his head doubtfully; \"he ain\u0027t mustered out\u0027n my mind yit, not by a dad-blamed sight. I\u0027m jest a-tellin\u0027 of you; he looks spry, an\u0027 he ain\u0027t no sneak—I\u0027ll swar to that on the stan\u0027.\" \"Well, I tell you, square,\" responded Teague, dryly, \"I hain\u0027t never seed people too flirty to pester yuther folks; an\u0027 I reckon you ain\u0027t nuther, is you?\" \"No,\" said Squire Pleasants, his experience appealed to instead of his judgment; \"no, I ain\u0027t, that\u0027s a fact; but some folks youer bleege to take on trus\u0027.\" Further comment on the part of Poteet and the others was arrested by the appearance of Woodward, who came out of his room, walked rapidly down the narrow hallway, and out upon the piazza. He was bare-headed, his bands were full of papers, and he had the air of a man of business. The younger men who had gathered around Squire Pleasants and Teague Poteet fell back loungingly as Woodward came forward with just the faintest perplexed smile. \"Judge Pleasants,\" he said, \"I\u0027m terribly mixed up, and I\u0027ll have to ask you to unmix me.\" The squire cleared his throat, adjusted his spectacles, and straightened himself in his chair. The title of Judge, and the easy air of deference with which it was bestowed, gave him an entirely new idea of his own importance. He frowned judicially as he laid his hand upon the papers. \"Well, sir,\" said he, \"I\u0027m gittin\u0027 ole, an\u0027 I reckon I ain\u0027t much nohow; I\u0027m sorter like the grey colt that tried to climb in the shuck-pen—I\u0027m weak, but willin\u0027. Ef you\u0027ll jest whirl in an\u0027 make indication whar\u0027in I can he\u0027p, I\u0027ll do the best I kin.\" \"I\u0027ve come up here to look after a lot of land,\" said Woodward. \"It is described here as lot No. 18, 376th district, Georgia Militia, part of land lot No. 11, in Tugaloo, formerly Towaliga County. Here is a plat of Hog Mountain, but somehow I can\u0027t locate the lot.\" The squire took the papers and began to examine them with painful particularity. \"That \u0027ar lot,\" said Teague Poteet, after a while, \"is the ole Mathis lot. The line runs right acrost my simblin\u0027 patch, an\u0027 backs up ag\u0027in\u0027 my hoss-stable.\" \"Tooby shore—tooby shore!\" exclaimed the squire. \"Tut-tut! What am I doin\u0027? My mind is drappin\u0027 loose like seed-ticks from a shumake bush. Tooby shore, it\u0027s the Mathis lot. Mr. Wooderd, Mr. Poteet—Mr. Poteet, Mr. Wooderd; lem me make you interduced, gents.\" Mr. Woodward shook hands gracefully and cordially—Poteet awkwardly and a trifle suspiciously. \"It seems to me, Mr. Poteet,\" said Woodward, \"that I have teen your name in the papers somewhere.\" \"Likely,\" replied Poteet; \"they uv bin a mighty sight er printin\u0027 gwino on sence the war, so I\u0027ve heern tell. Ef you\u0027d a drappod in at Atlanty, you mought er seed my name mixt up in a warrant.\" \"How is that?\" Woodward asked. \"Bekaze I bin a-bossin\u0027 my own affa\u0027rs.\" Poteet had straightened himself up, and he looked at Woodward with a steadiness which the other did not misunderstand. It was a look which said, \"If you\u0027ve got that warrant in your pocket, it won\u0027t be safe to pull it out in these diggm\u0027s.\" Squire Pleasants recognised the challenge that made itself heard in Teague Poteet\u0027s voice. \"Yes, yes,\" he said, in a cheerful tone, \"our folks is seen some mighty quare doin\u0027s sence the war; but times is a-gittin\u0027 a long ways better now.\" \"Better, hell!\" exclaimed Sid Parmalee. What he would have said further no one can know, for the voluminous voice of Cohen broke in— \"Tlook ow-ut, t\u0027ere, Sid! tlook ow-ut! t\u0027at pad man kedge you!\" This remarkable admonition was received with a shout of laughter. Good-humour was restored, and it was increased when Woodward, shortly afterward, drinking with the boys at Nix\u0027s saloon, called for three fingers of Mountain Dew, and washed it down with the statement that it tasted just as nice as liquor that had been stamped by the Government. In short, Woodward displayed such tact, and entered with such heartiness into the spirit of the people around him, that he disarmed the trained suspicions of a naturally suspicious community. Perhaps this statement should be qualified. Undoubtedly the marshal, could he have made a personal inspection of Woodward and his surroundings, would have praised his subordinate\u0027s tact. The truth is, while he had disarmed their suspicions, he had failed utterly to gain their confidence. With a general as well as a particular interest in the direction of Hog Mountain, it was natural that Deputy- Marshal Woodward should meet or overtake Miss Poteet as she rode back and forth between Gullettsville and the grey notch in the mountain known as Poteet\u0027s. It was natural, too, that he should take advantage of the social informalities of the section and make her acquaintance. It was an acquaintance in which Woodward, and, presumably, the young lady herself, became very much interested; so that the spectacle of this attractive couple galloping along together over the red road that connected the valley with the mountain came to be a familiar one. And its effect upon those who paused to take note of it was not greatly different from the effect of such spectacles in other sections. Some looked wise and shook their heads sorrowfully; some smiled and looked kindly, and sent all manner of good wishes after the young people. But whether they galloped down the mountain in the fresh hours of the morning, or rambled up its dark slope in the dusk of the evening, neither Woodward nor Sis Poteet gave a thought to the predictions of spite, or to the prophecies of friendliness. The mountain girl was a surprise to Woodward. She had improved her few opportunities to the utmost. Such information as the Gullettsville Academy afforded she relished and absorbed, so that her education was thorough as far as it went. Neither her conversation nor her manners would have attracted special attention in a company of fairly bright young girls, but she formed a refreshing contrast to the social destitution of the mountain region. Beyond this, her personality was certainly more attractive than that of most women, being based upon an independence which knew absolutely nothing of the thousand and one vexatious little aspirations that are essential to what is called social success. Unlike the typical American girl, whose sweetly severe portraits smile serenely at us from the canvas of contemporary fiction, Miss Poteet would have been far from equal to the task of meeting all the requirements of perfectly organised society; but she could scarcely have been placed in a position in which her natural brightness and vivacity would not have attracted attention. At any rate, the indefinable charm of her presence, her piquancy, and her beauty, was a perpetual challenge to the admiration of Deputy-Marshal Woodward. It pursued him in his dreams, and made him uncomfortable in his waking hours, so much so, indeed, that his duties as a revenue officer, perplexing at best, became a burden to him. In point of fact, this lively young lady was the unforeseen quantity in the problem which Woodward had been employed to solve; and, between his relations to the Government and his interest in Sis Poteet, he found himself involved in an awkward predicament. Perhaps the main features of this predicament, baldly presented, would have been more puzzling to the authorities at Washington than they were to Woodward; but it is fair to the young man to say that he did not mistake the fact that the Moonshiner had a daughter for an argument in favour of illicit distilling, albeit the temptation to do so gave him considerable anxiety. In the midst of his perplexity, Deputy-Marshal Woodward concluded that it would be better for the Government, and better for his own peace of mind, if he allowed Sis Poteet to ride home without an escort; and for several days he left her severely alone, while he attended to his duties, as became a young fellow of fair business habits. But one afternoon, as he sat on the piazza of the hotel nursing his confusion and discontent, Sis Poteet rode by. It was a tantalising vision, though a fleeting one. It seemed to be merely the flash of a red feather, the wave of a white hand, to which Woodward lifted his hat; but these were sufficient. The red feather nodded gaily to him, the white hand invited. His horse stood near, and in a few moments he was galloping toward the mountain with the Moonshiner\u0027s daughter. When the night fell at Teague Poteet\u0027s on this particular evening, it found a fiddle going. The boys and girls of the mountain, to the number of a dozen or more, had gathered for a frolic—a frolic that shook the foundations of Poteet\u0027s castle, and aroused echoes familiar enough to the good souls who are fond of the cotillon in its primitive shape. The old folks who had accompanied the youngsters sat in the kitchen with Teague and his wife, and here Woodward also sat, listening with interest to the gossip of what seemed to be a remote era—the war and the period preceding it. The activity of Sis Poteet found ample scope, and, whether lingering for a moment at her father\u0027s side like a bird poised in flight, or moving lightly through the figures of the cotillon, she never appeared to better advantage. Toward midnight, when the frolic was at its height, an unexpected visitor announced himself. It was Uncle Jake Norris, who lived on the far side of the mountain. The fiddler waved his bow at Uncle Jake, and the boys and girls cried \"Howdy,\" as the visitor stood beaming and smiling in the doorway. To these demonstrations Uncle Jake, \"a chunk of a white man with a whole heart,\" as he described himself, made cordial response, and passed on into the kitchen. The good-humour of Mr. Norris was as prominent as his rotundity. When he was not laughing, he was ready to laugh. He seated himself, looked around at the company, and smiled. \"It\u0027s a long pull betwixt this an\u0027 Atlanty,\" he said after a while; \"it is that, certain an\u0027 shore, an\u0027 I hain\u0027t smelt of the jug sence I lef ther\u0027. Pull \u0027er out, Teague, pull \u0027er out.\" The jug was forthcoming. \"Now, then,\" continued Uncle Jake, removing the corn-cob stopper, \"this looks like home, sweet home, ez I may say. It does, certain an\u0027 shore. None to jine me? Well, well! Times change an\u0027 change, but the jug is company for one. So be it. Ez St. Paul says, cleave nigh unto that which is good. I\u0027m foreswore not to feel lonesome tell I go to the gallows. Friends! you uv got my good wishes, one an\u0027 all!\" \"What\u0027s a-gwine on?\" asked Poteet. \"The same,\" responded Uncle Jake, after swallowing his dram. \"Allers the same. Wickedness pervails wellnigh unto hit\u0027s own jestiflcation. I uv seed sights! You all know the divers besettings wher\u0027by Jackson Ricks wuz took off this season gone—murdered I may say, in the teeth of the law an\u0027 good govunment. Sirs! I sot by an\u0027 seed his besetters go scotch-free.\" \"Ah!\" The exclamation came from Teague Poteet. \"Yes, sirs! yes, friends!\" continued Uncle Jake, closing his eyes and tilting his chair back. \"Even so. Nuther does I boast ez becometh the fibble-minded. They hurried an\u0027 skurried me forth an\u0027 hence, to mount upon the witness stan\u0027 an\u0027 relate the deed. No deniance did I make. Ez St. Paul says, sin, takin\u0027 occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of conspicuessence. I told \u0027em what these here eyes had seed. \"They errayed me before jedge an\u0027 jury,\" Uncle Jake went on, patting the jug affectionately, \"an\u0027 I bowed my howdies. \u0027Gen-termun friends,\u0027 s\u0027 I, \u0027foller me close\u0027t, bekaze I\u0027m a-givin\u0027 you but the truth, stupendous though it be. Ef you thes but name the word,\u0027 s\u0027 I, \u0027I\u0027ll take an\u0027 lay my han\u0027 upon the men that done this unrighteousness, for they stan\u0027 no furder than yon piller,\u0027 s\u0027 I. \u0027Them men,\u0027 s\u0027 I, \u0027surroundered the house of Jackson Ricks, gentermun friends, he bein\u0027 a member of Friendship Church, an\u0027 called \u0027im forth wi\u0027 the ashoreance of Satan an\u0027 the intents of evil,\u0027 s\u0027 I; \u0027an\u0027 ole en decrippled ez he wuz, they shot \u0027im down—them men at yon piller,\u0027 s\u0027 I, \u0027ere he could but raise his trimblin\u0027 han\u0027 in supplication; an\u0027 the boldest of \u0027em dast not to face me here an\u0027 say nay,\u0027 s\u0027 I.\" \"An\u0027 they uv cler\u0027d the men what kilt pore Jackson Ricks!\" said Teague, rubbing his grizzled chin. \"Ez clean an\u0027 ez cle\u0027r ez the pa\u0027m er my han\u0027,\" replied Uncle Jake, with emphasis. The fiddle in the next room screamed forth a jig, and the tireless feet of the dancers kept time, but there was profound silence among those in the kitchen. Uncle Jake took advantage of this pause to renew his acquaintance with the jug. Deputy-Marshal Woodward knew of the killing of Jackson Ricks; that is to say, he was familiar with the version of the affair which had been depended upon to relieve the revenue officers of the responsibility of downright murder; but he was convinced that the story told by Uncle Jake Norris was nearer the truth. As the young man rode down the mountain, leaving the fiddle and the dancers to carry the frolic into the grey dawn, he pictured to himself the results of the raid that he would be expected to lead against Hog Mountain—the rush upon Poteet\u0027s, the shooting of the old Moonshiner, and the spectacle of the daughter wringing her hands and weeping wildly. He rode down the mountain, and, before the sun rose, he had written and mailed his resignation. In a private note to the marshal, enclosed with this document, he briefly but clearly set forth the fact that, while illicit distilling was as unlawful as ever, the man who loved a Moonshiner\u0027s daughter was not a proper instrument to aid in its suppression. But his letter failed to have the effect he desired, and in a few weeks he received a communication from Atlanta setting forth the fact that a raid had been determined upon. Meantime, while events were developing, some of the old women of the Hog Mountain Range had begun to manifest a sort of motherly interest in the affairs of Woodward and Sis Poteet. These women, living miles apart on the mountain and its spurs, had a habit of \"picking up their work\" and spending the day with each other. Upon one occasion it chanced that Mrs. Sue Parmalee and Mrs. Puritha Hightower rode ten miles to visit Mrs. Puss Poteet. \"Don\u0027t lay the blame of it onter me, Puss,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hightower,—her shrill, thin voice in queer contrast with her fat and jovial appearance; \"don\u0027t you lay the blame onter me. Dave, he\u0027s been a-complainin\u0027 bekaze they wa\u0027n\u0027t no salsody in the house, an\u0027 I rid over to Sue\u0027s to borry some. Airter I got ther\u0027, Sue sez, se\u0027 she; \u0027Yess us pick up an\u0027 go an\u0027 light in on Puss,\u0027 se\u0027 she, \u0027an\u0027 fine out sump\u0027n\u0027 nuther that\u0027s a-gwine on \u0027mongst folks,\u0027 se\u0027 she.\" \"Yes, lay it all onter me,\" said Mrs. Parmalee, looking over her spectacles at Mrs. Poteet; \"I sez to Purithy, s\u0027 I, \u0027Purithy, yess go down an\u0027 see Puss,\u0027 s\u0027 I; \u0027maybe we\u0027ll git a glimpse er that air new chap with the slick ha\u0027r. Sid\u0027ll be a-peggin\u0027 out airter a while,\u0027 s\u0027 I, \u0027an\u0027 ef the new chap\u0027s ez purty ez I hear tell, maybe I\u0027ll set my cap fer \u0027im,\u0027 s\u0027 I.\" At this fat Mrs. Puritha Hightower was compelled to lean on frail Mrs. Puss Poteet, so heartily did she laugh. \"I declar\u0027,\" she exclaimed, \"ef Sue hain\u0027t a sight! I\u0027m mighty nigh outdone. She\u0027s thes bin a-gwine on that a-way all the time, an\u0027 I bin that tickled tell a little more an\u0027 I\u0027d a drapped on the groun\u0027. How\u0027s all?\" \"My goodness!\" exclaimed Mrs. Poteet, \"I hope you all know me too well to be a-stan\u0027in\u0027 out there makin\u0027 excuse. Come right along in, an\u0027 take off your things, an\u0027 ketch your win\u0027. Sis is home to-day.\" \"Well, I\u0027m monstus glad,\" said Mrs. Hightower. \"Sis use to think the world an\u0027 all er me when she was a slip of a gal, but I reckon she\u0027s took on town ways, hain\u0027t she? Hit ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 but natchul.\" \"Sis is proud enough for to hoi\u0027 \u0027er head high,\" Mrs. Parmalee explained, \"but she hain\u0027t a bit stuck up.\" \"Well, I let you know,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hightower, untying her bonnet and taking off her shawl, \"I let you know, here\u0027s what wouldn\u0027t be sot back by nothin\u0027 ef she had Sis\u0027s chances. In about the las\u0027 word pore maw spoke on \u0027er dying bed, she call me to \u0027er an\u0027 sez, se\u0027 she, \u0027Purithy Emma,\u0027 se\u0027 she, \u0027you hol\u0027 your head high; don\u0027t you bat your eyes for to please none of \u0027em,\u0027 se\u0027 she.\" \"I reckon in reason I oughter be thankful that Sis ain\u0027t no wuss,\" said Mrs. Poteet, walking around with aimless hospitality; \"yit that chile\u0027s temper is powerful tryin\u0027, an\u0027 Teague ackshully an\u0027 candidly b\u0027leeves she\u0027s made out\u0027n pyo\u0027gol\u0027. [Footnote: Pure gold] I wish I may die ef he don\u0027t.\" After a while Sis made her appearance, buoyant and blooming. Her eyes sparkled, her cheeks glowed, and her smiles showed beautiful teeth—a most uncommon sight in the mountains, where the girls were in the habit of rubbing snuff or smoking. The visitors greeted her with the effusive constraint and awkwardness that made so large a part of their lives, but after a while Mrs. Hightower laid her fat motherly hand on the girl\u0027s shoulder, and looked kindly but keenly into her eyes. \"Ah, honey!\" she said, \"you hain\u0027t sp\u0027ilt yit, but you wa\u0027n\u0027t made to fit thish here hill—that you wa\u0027n\u0027t, that you wa\u0027n\u0027t!\" Women are not hypocrites. Their little thrills arid nerve-convulsions are genuine while they last. Fortunately for the women themselves, they do not last, but are succeeded by others of various moods, tenses, and genders. These nerve-convulsions are so genuine and so apt that they are known as intuitions, and under this name they have achieved importance. Mrs. Hightower, with all her lack of experience, was capable of feeling that Sis Poteet needed the by no means unsubstantial encouragement that lies in one little note of sympathy, and she was not at all astonished when Sis responded to her intention by giving her a smart little hug. Presently Mrs. Parmalee, who had stationed herself near the door, lifted her thin right arm and let it fall upon her lap. \"Well, sir!\" she exclaimed, \"ef yander ain\u0027t Sis\u0027s bo!\" Sis ran to the door, saw Woodward coming up the road, and blushed furiously—a feat which Mrs. Hightower and Mrs. Parmalee, with all their experience, had rarely seen performed in that region. Woodward greeted Mrs. Poteet\u0027s visitors with a gentle deference and an easy courtesy that attracted their favour in spite of themselves. Classing him with the \"Restercrats,\" these women took keen and suspicious note of every word he uttered, and every movement he made, holding themselves in readiness to become mortally offended at a curl of the lip or the lifting of an eyebrow; but he was equal to the occasion. He humoured their whims and eccentricities to the utmost, and he was so thoroughly sympathetic, so genial, so sunny, and so handsome withal, that he stirred most powerfully the maternal instincts of those weather-beaten bosoms, and made them his friends and defenders. He told them wonderful stories of life in the great world that lay far beyond Hog Mountain, its spurs and its foot-hills. He lighted their pipes, and even filled them out of his own tobacco-pouch, a proceeding which caused Mrs. Parmalee to remark that she \"would like mannyfac\u0027 [Footnote: \"Manufactured\" tobacco, in contradistinction to the natural leaf.] mighty well ef \u0027twer\u0027n\u0027t so powerful weak.\" Mrs. Hightower found early opportunity to deliver her verdict in Sis\u0027s ear, whereupon the latter gave her a little hug, and whispered: \"Oh, I just think he\u0027s adorable!\" It was very queer, however, that as soon as Sis was left to entertain Mr. Woodward (the women making an excuse of helping Puss about dinner), she lost her blushing enthusiasm, and became quite cold and reserved. The truth is, Sis had convinced herself some days before that she had the right to be very angry with this young man, and she began her quarrel, as lovely woman generally does, by assuming an air of tremendous unconcern. Her disinterestedness was really provoking. \"How did you like Sue Fraley\u0027s new bonnet last Sunday?\" she asked, with an innocent smile. \"Sue Fraley\u0027s new bonnet!\" exclaimed Woodward, surprised in the midst of some serious reflections; \"why, I didn\u0027t know she had a new bonnet.\" \"Oh! you didn\u0027t? You were right opposite. I should think anybody could see she had a new bonnet by the way she tossed her head.\" \"Well, I didn\u0027t notice it, for one. Was it one of these sky-scrapers? I was looking at something else.\" \"Oh!\" Woodward had intended to convey a very delicately veiled compliment, but this young woman\u0027s tone rather embarrassed him. He saw in a moment that she was beyond the reach of the playful and ingenious banter which he had contrived to make the basis of their relations. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I was looking at something else. I had other things to think about.\" \"Well, she did have a new bonnet, with yellow ribbons. She looked handsome. I hear she\u0027s going to get married soon.\" \"I\u0027m glad to hear it. She\u0027s none too young,\" said Woodward. At another time Sis would have laughed at the suggestion implied in this remark, but now she only tapped the floor gently with her foot, and looked serious. \"I hope you answered her note,\" she said presently. \"What note?\" he asked, with some astonishment, Sis was the picture of innocence. \"Oh, I didn\u0027t think!\" she exclaimed. \"I reckon it\u0027s a great secret. I mean the note she handed you when she came out of church. It\u0027s none of my business.\" \"Nor of mine either,\" said Woodward, with a relieved air. \"The note was for Tip Watson.\" This statement, which was not only plausible but true, gave a new direction to Sis\u0027s anger. \"Well, I don\u0027t see how anybody that thinks anything of himself could be a mail-carrier for Sue Fraley!\" she exclaimed scornfully; whereupon she flounced out, leaving Woodward in a state of bewilderment. He had not made love to the girl, principally because her moods were elusive and her methods unique. She was dangerously like other women of his acquaintance, and dangerously unlike them. The principal of the academy in Gullettsville—a scholarly old gentleman from Middle Georgia, who had been driven to teaching by dire necessity—had once loftily informed Woodward that Miss Poteet was superior to her books, and the young man had verified the statement to his own discomfiture. She possessed that feminine gift which is of more importance to a woman in this world than scholarly acquirements—aptitude. Even her frankness—perfectly discreet—charmed and puzzled Woodward; but the most attractive of her traits were such as mark the difference between the bird that sings in the tree and the bird that sings in the cage—delightful, but indescribable. When Sis Poteet began to question him about Sue Fraley, the thought that she was moved by jealousy gave him a thrill that was new to his experience; but when she flounced angrily out of the room because he had confessed to carrying a note from Miss Fraley to Tip Watson, it occurred to him that he might be mistaken. Indeed, so cunning does masculine stupidity become when it is played upon by a woman, that he frightened himself with the suggestion that perhaps, after all, this perfectly original young lady was in love with Tip Watson. During the rest of the day Woodward had ample time to nurse and develop his new theory, and the more he thought it over the more plausible it seemed to be. It was a great blow to his vanity; but the more uncomfortable it made him the more earnestly he clung to it. Without appearing to avoid him, Sis managed to make the presence of Mrs. Parmalee and Mrs. Hightower an excuse for neglecting him. She entertained these worthy ladies with such eager hospitality that when they aroused themselves to the necessity of going home, they found to their dismay that it would be impossible, in the language of Mrs. Poteet, to \"git half way acrost Pullium\u0027s Summit \u0027fore night \u0027ud ketch \u0027em.\" Sis was so delighted, apparently, that she became almost hilarious; and her gaiety affected all around her except Woodward, who barely managed to conceal his disgust. After supper, however, Mrs. Poteet and her two guests betook themselves to the kitchen, where they rubbed snuff and smoked their pipes, and gossiped, and related reminiscences of that good time which, with old people, is always in the past. Thus Woodward had ample opportunity to talk with Sis. He endeavoured, by the exercise of every art of manner and conversation of which he was master, to place their relations upon the old familiar footing, but he failed most signally. He found it impossible to fathom the gentle dignity with which he was constantly repulsed. In the midst of his perplexity, which would have been either pathetic or ridiculous if it had not been so artfully concealed, he managed for the first time to measure the depth of his love for this exasperating but charming creature whom he had been patronising. She was no longer amusing; and Woodward, with the savage inconsistency of a man moved by a genuine passion, felt a tragic desire to humble himself before her. \"I\u0027m going home to-morrow, Miss Sis,\" he said finally, in sheer desperation. \"Well, you\u0027ve had a heap of fun—I mean,\" she added, \"that you have had a nice time.\" \"I have been a fool!\" he exclaimed bitterly. Seeing that she made no response, he continued: \"I\u0027ve been a terrible fool all through. I came here to hunt up blockade whisky——\" \"What!\" Sis\u0027s voice was sharp and eager, full of doubt, surprise, and consternation. \"I came to Gullettsville,\" he went on, \"to hunt up blockade whisky, and failed, and three weeks ago I sent in my resignation. I thought I might find a gold mine on my land-lot, but I have failed, and now I am going to sell it. I have failed in everything.\" Gloating over his alleged misfortunes, Woodward, without looking at Sis Poteet, drew from his pocket a formidable-looking envelope, unfolded its contents leisurely, and continued— \"Even my resignation was a failure. Hog Mountain will be raided to-morrow or next day.\" Sis rose from her chair, pale and furious, and advanced toward him as if to annihilate him with her blazing eyes. Such rage, such contempt, he had never before beheld in a woman\u0027s face. He sat transfixed. With a gesture almost tragic in its vehemence, the girl struck the papers from his hands. \"O you mean, sneaking wretch! You——\" And then, as if realising the weakness of mere words, she turned and passed swiftly from the room. Woodward was thoroughly aroused. He was not used to the spectacle of a woman controlled by violent emotions, and he recognised, with a mixture of surprise and alarm, the great gulf that lay between the rage of Sis Poteet and the little platitudes and pretences of anger which he had seen the other women of his acquaintance manage with such pretty daintiness. As the girl passed through the kitchen, she seized a horn that hung upon the wall, and went out into the darkness. The old women continued their smoking, their snuff-rubbing, and their gossiping. Mrs. High-tower was giving the details of a local legend showing how and why Edny Favers had \"conjured\" Tabithy Cozby, when suddenly Mrs. Poteet raised her hands— \"Sh-h-h!\" The notes of a horn—short, sharp, and strenuous—broke in upon the stillness of the night. Once, twice, thrice! once, twice, thrice! once, twice, thrice! It was an alarm that did not need to be interpreted to the sensitive ear of Hog Mountain. The faces of the old women became curiously impassive. The firelight carried their shadows from the floor to the rafters, where they seemed to engage in a wild dance,—whirling, bowing, jumping, quivering; but the women themselves sat as still as statues. They were evidently waiting for something. They did not wait long. In a little while the sharp notes of the horn made themselves heard again—once, twice, thrice! once, twice, thrice! once, twice, thrice! Then the old women arose from their low chairs, shook out their frocks, and filed into the room where Mr. Philip Woodward, late of the revenue service, was sitting. There would have been a good deal of constraint on both sides, but before there could be any manifestation of this sort, Sis came in. She seemed to be crushed and helpless, nay, even humiliated. \"Why, my goodness, Sis!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hightower, \"you look natchully fagged out. A body \u0027ud think you\u0027d bin an\u0027 taken a run up the mountain. We all \u0027lowed you wuz in here lookin\u0027 airter your comp\u0027ny. Wher\u0027d you git the news?\" \"From this gentleman here,\" Sis replied, indicating Woodward without looking at him. She was pale as death, and her voice was low and gentle. Woodward would have explained, but the apparent unconcern of the women gave him no opportunity. \"I declare, Sis,\" exclaimed her mother, with a fond, apologetic little laugh; \"ef you hain\u0027t a plum sight, I hain\u0027t never seed none.\" \"She\u0027s thes es much like her Gran\u0027pap Poteet,\" said Mrs. Hightower, \"ez ef he\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 spit\u0027er right out\u0027n his mouth—that she is.\" This led to a series of reminiscences more or less entertaining, until after a while, Sis, who had been growing more and more restless, rose and said— \"Good night, folks; I\u0027m tired and sleepy. The clock has struck eleven.\" \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Poteet, \"an\u0027 the clock\u0027s too fast, bekaze it hain\u0027t skacely bin more\u0027u a minnit sence the chickens crowed for ten.\" This remark contained the essence of hospitality, for it was intended to convey to Mrs. Poteet\u0027s guests the information that if they were not ready to retire, she was prepared to discredit her clock in their interests. But there was not much delay on the part of the guests. The women were dying to question Sis, and Woodward was anxious to be alone; and so they said \"Good night,\" the earnestness and quaint simplicity of the old women carrying Woodward back to the days of his childhood, when his grandmother leaned tenderly over his little bed, and whispered: \"Good night, dear heart, and pleasant dreams.\" Shortly afterward the lights were put out, and, presumably, those under Teague Poteet\u0027s roof addressed themselves to slumber. But what of the news that Sis had given to the winds? There was no slumber for it until it had fulfilled its mission. Where did it go, and what was its burden? Three sharp blasts upon a horn, thrice repeated; then an interval; then three more thrice repeated. Up, up the mountain the signal climbed; now faltering, now falling, but always climbing; sending echoes before it, and leaving echoes behind it, but climbing, climbing; now fainting and dying away, but climbing, climbing, until it reached Pullium\u0027s Summit, the smallest thread of sound. Two men were sitting talking in front of a cabin. The eldest placed one hand upon the shoulder of his companion, and flung the other to his ear. Faint and far, but clear and strenuous, came the signal. The men listened even after it had died away. The leaves of the tall chestnuts whipped each other gently, and the breeze that had borne the signal seemed to stay in the tops of the mountain pines as if awaiting further orders; and it had not long to wait. The man who had held his hand to his ear slapped his companion on the back, and cried, \"Poteet\u0027s!\" and that was news enough for the other, who rose, stretched himself lazily, and passed into the cabin. He came out with a horn—an exaggerated trumpet made of tin,—and with this to his lips he repeated to the waiting breeze, and to the echoes that were glad to be aroused, the news that had come from Poteet\u0027s. Across the broad plateau of Pullium\u0027s Summit the wild tidings flew, until, reaching the western verge of the mountain, they dived down into Prather\u0027s Mill Road—a vast gorge which takes its name from the freak of a drunken mountaineer, who declared he would follow the stream that rushed through it until he found a mill, and was never heard of again. The news from Poteet\u0027s was not so easily lost. It dropped over the sheer walls of the chasm, three hundred feet down, and refused to be drowned out by the rush and roar of the waters, as they leaped over the boulders, until it had accomplished its mission. For here in Prather\u0027s Mill Road burned the slow fires that kept the Government officials in Atlanta at a white heat. They were burning now. If one of the officials could have crawled to the edge of the gorge, where everything seemed dwarfed by the towering walls of rook and the black abyss from which they sprang, he would have seen small fitful sparks of flame glowing at intervals upon the bosom of the deeper and blacker night below. These were the fires that all the power and ingenuity of the Government failed to smother, but they were now blown out one after another by the blasts from Sis Poteet\u0027s horn. The news that was wafted down into the depths of Prather\u0027s Mill Road upon the wings of the wind was not at all alarming. On the contrary, it was received by the grimy watchers at the stills with considerable hilarity. To the most of them it merely furnished an excuse for a week\u0027s holiday, including trips to both Gullettsville and Villa Ray. Freely interpreted, it ran thus: \"Friends and fellow- citizens: this is to inform you that Hog Mountain is to be raided by the revenue men by way of Teague Poteet\u0027s. Let us hear from you at once.\" There was neither alarm nor hurry, but the fires were put out quickly, because that was the first thing to be done. Teague Poteet owned and managed two stills. He was looking after some \"doublings\" when the notes of the horn dropped down into the gorge. He paused, and listened, and smiled. Uncle Jake Norris, who had come to have his jug filled, was in the act of taking a dram, but he waited, balancing the tin cup in the palm of his hand. Tip Watson was telling one of his stories to the two little boys who accompanied Uncle Jake, but he never ended it. \"Sis talks right out in meetin\u0027,\" said Teague, after waiting to be sure there was no postscript to the message. \"What\u0027s the row, Teague?\" asked Uncle Jake, swallowing his dram. \"\u0027Nother raid comin\u0027 right in front er my door,\" Teague explained, \"an\u0027 I reckon in reason I oughter be home when they go past. They use to be a kinder coolness betweenst me an\u0027 them revenue fellers, but we went to work an\u0027 patched it up.\" Tip Watson appeared to be so overjoyed that he went through all the forms of a cotillon dance, imitating a fiddle, calling the figures, and giving his hand to imaginary partners. The boys fairly screamed with laughter at this exhibition, and Uncle Jake was so overcome that he felt called upon to take another dram—a contingency that was renewed when Tip swung from the measure of a cotillon to that of a breakdown, singing— \"I hain\u0027t bin a-wantin\u0027 no mo\u0027 wines—mo\u0027 wines— Sence daddy got drunk on low wines—low wines.\" \"Come, Tip,\" said Teague, \"yess shet up shop. Ef Sis ain\u0027t a caution,\" he said, after a while, as he moved around putting things to rights. \"Ef Sis ain\u0027t a caution, you kin shoot me. They hain\u0027t no mo\u0027 tellin\u0027 wher\u0027 Sis picked up \u0027bout thish \u0027ere raid than nothin\u0027 in the worl\u0027. Dang me ef I don\u0027t b\u0027lieve the gal\u0027s glad when a raid\u0027s a-comin\u0027. Wi\u0027 Sis, hit\u0027s movement, movement, day in an\u0027 day out. They hain\u0027t nobody knows that gal less\u0027n it\u0027s me. She knows how to keep things a-gwine. Sometimes she runs an\u0027 meets me, an\u0027 says, se\u0027 she: \u0027Pap, mammy\u0027s in the dumps; yess you an\u0027 me make out we er quollin\u0027. Hit\u0027ll sorter stir \u0027er up;\u0027 an\u0027 then Sis, she\u0027ll light in, an\u0027 by the time we git in the house, she\u0027s a-scoldin\u0027 an\u0027 a-sassin\u0027 an\u0027 I\u0027m a-cussin\u0027, en\u0027 airter a while hit gits so hot an\u0027 natchul-like that I thes has ter drag Sis out behin\u0027 the chimbly and buss \u0027er for to make certain an\u0027 shore that she ain\u0027t accidentally flew off the han\u0027le. Bliss your soul an\u0027 body! she\u0027s a caution!\" \"An\u0027 what\u0027s \u0027er maw a-doin\u0027 all that time?\" inquired Uncle Jake, as he took another dram with an indifferent air. Teague laughed aloud as he packed the fresh earth over his fire. \"Oh, Puss! Puss, she thes sets thar a-chawin\u0027 away at \u0027er snuff, an\u0027 a-knittin\u0027 away at \u0027er socks tell she thinks I \u0027m a-pushin\u0027 Sis too clost, an\u0027 then she blazes out an\u0027 blows me up. Airter that,\" Teague continued, \"things gits more homelike. Ef \u0027twan\u0027t fer me an\u0027 Sis, I reckon Puss \u0027nd teetotally fret \u0027erself away.\" \"St. Paul,\" said Uncle Jake, looking confidentially at another dram which he had poured into the tin cup,—\"St. Paul says ther\u0027 er divers an\u0027 many wimmin, an\u0027 I reckon he know\u0027d. Ther\u0027 er some you kin fret an some you can\u0027t. Ther\u0027s my ole \u0027oman: the livin\u0027 human bein\u0027 that stirs her up\u0027ll have ter frail \u0027er out, er she\u0027ll frail him.\" \"Well,\" said Teague, by way of condolence, \"the man what\u0027s stabbed by a pitchfork hain\u0027t much better off \u0027n the man that walks bar\u0027footed in a treadsaft patch.\" The suggestion in regard to Mistress Norris seemed to remind Uncle Jake of something important. He called to his boys, took another modest dram, and disappeared in the undergrowth. Teague Poteet and his friends were soon ready to follow this worthy example, so that in another hour Prather\u0027s Mill Road was a very dull and uninteresting place from a revenue point of view. Woodward was aroused during the night by the loud barking of dogs, the tramp of horses, and the confused murmur of suppressed conversation. Looking from the window, he judged by the position of the stars that it was three or four o\u0027clock in the morning. He sat upon the side of the bed, and sought, by listening intently, to penetrate the mystery of this untimely commotion. He thought he recognised the voice of Tip Watson, and he was sure he heard Sid Parmalee\u0027s peculiar cough and chuckle. The conversation soon lifted itself out of the apparent confusion, and became comparatively distinct. The voices were those of Teague and Sis. \"Come now, pap, you must promise.\" \"Why, Sis, how kin I?\" \"You shall, you shall, you shall!\" \"Why, Sis, hon, he mought be a spy. Sid Pannalee he \u0027lows that the whole dad-blamed business is a put-up job. He wants to bet right now that we\u0027ll all be in jail in Atlanty \u0027fore the moon changes. I lay they don\u0027t none of \u0027em fool Sid.\" \"You don\u0027t love me any more,\" said Sis, taking a new tack. \"Good Lord, Sis! Why, honey, what put that idee in your head?\" \"I know you don\u0027t—I know it! Its always Dave Hightower this, and Sid Par-malee that, and old drunken Jake Norris the other. I just know you don\u0027t love me.\" Teague also took a new tack, but there was a quiver in his voice born of deadly earnestness. \"I tell you, Sis, they er houndin\u0027 airter us; they er runnin\u0027 us down; they er closin\u0027 in on us; they er hemmin\u0027 us up. Airter they git your pore ole pappy an\u0027 slam \u0027im in jail, an\u0027 chain \u0027im down, who\u0027s a-gwineter promise to take keer er him? Hain\u0027t ole man Joshway Blasingame bin sent away off to Albenny? Hain\u0027t ole man Cajy Shannon a-sarvin\u0027 out his time, humpback an\u0027 cripple ez he is? Who took keer them? Who ast anybody to let up on \u0027em? But don\u0027t you fret, honey; ef they hain\u0027t no trap sot, nobody ain\u0027t a-gwineter pester him.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t trust that Sid Parmalee out of my sight!\" exclaimed Sis, beginning to cry. \"I know him, and I know all of you.\" \"But ef they is a trap sot,\" continued Teague, ignoring Sis\u0027s tears, \"ef they is, I tell you, honey, a thousau\u0027 folks like me can\u0027t hol\u0027 the boys down. The time \u0027a done come when they er teetotally wore out with thish \u0027ere sneakin\u0027 aroun\u0027 an\u0027 hidin\u0027-out bizness.\" This appeared to end the conversation, but it left Woodward considerably puzzled. Shortly afterward he heard a rap at his door, and before he could respond to the summons by inquiry or invitation, Teague Poteet entered with a lighted candle in his hand. \"I \u0027lowed the stirrin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027 mought \u0027a\u0027 sorter rousted you,\" said Teague, by way of apology, as he placed the light on a small table and seated himself on a wooden chest. \"Yes. What\u0027s up?\" Woodward inquired. \"Oh, the boys—thes the boys,\" Teague replied, chuckling and rubbing his chin with an embarrassed air; \"hit\u0027s thes the boys cuttin\u0027 up some er ther capers. They er mighty quare, the boys is,\" he continued, his embarrassment evidently increasing, \"mighty quare. They uv up\u0027d an\u0027 tuk a notion for to go on a little frolic, an\u0027 they uv come by airter me, an\u0027 nothin\u0027 won\u0027t do \u0027em but I mus\u0027 fetch you. S\u0027 I, \u0027Gentermen, they hain\u0027t no manners in astin\u0027 a man on a marchin\u0027 frolic this time er night,\u0027 s\u0027 I; but Sid Parmalee, he chipped in an\u0027 \u0027lowed that you wuz ez high up for fun ez the next man.\" Woodward thought he understood the drift of things, but he was desperately uncertain. He reflected a moment, and then faced the situation squarely. \"If you were in my place, Mr. Poteet, what would you do?\" he asked. This seemed to relieve Teague, His embarrassment disappeared. His eyes, which had been wandering uneasily around the room, sought Woodward\u0027s face and rested there. He took off his wide-brimmed wool hat, placed it carefully upon the floor, and ran his fingers through his iron-grey hair. \"I don\u0027t mind sayin\u0027,\" he remarked grimly, \"that I uv seed the time when I\u0027d uv ast you to drap out\u0027n that winder an\u0027 make for the bushes, knowin\u0027 that you\u0027d tote a han\u0027ful er bullets in thar wi\u0027 you. But on account er me an\u0027 Sis, I\u0027m willin\u0027 to extracise my bes\u0027 judgment. It mayn\u0027t be satisfactual, but me an\u0027 Sis is mighty long-headed when we pulls tergether. Ef I was you, I\u0027d thes slip on my duds, an\u0027 I\u0027d go out thar whar the boys is, an\u0027 I\u0027d be high up for the\u0027r frolic, an\u0027 I\u0027d jine in wi\u0027 \u0027em, an\u0027 I\u0027d raise any chune they give out.\" With this Poteet gravely bowed himself out, and in a very few minutes Woodward was dressed and ready for adventure. He was young and bold, but he felt strangely ill at ease. He realised that, with all his address, he had never been able to gain the confidence of these mountaineers, and he felt sure they connected him with the revenue raid that was about to be made, and of which they had received information. He appreciated to the fullest extent the fact that the situation called for the display of all the courage and coolness and nerve he could command; but, in the midst of it all, he longed for an opportunity to show Sis Poteet the difference between a real man and a feebleminded, jocular rascal like Tip Watson. His spirits rose as he stepped from the low piazza into the darkness and made his way to where he heard the rattle of stirrups and spurs. Some one hailed him— \"Hello, Cap!\" \"Ah-yi!\" he responded. \"It\u0027s here we go, gals, to the wedding.\" \"I knowed we could count on \u0027im,\" said the voice of Tip Watson. \"Yes,\" said Sid Parmalee, \"I knowed it so well that I fotch a extry hoss.\" \"Where are we going?\" Woodward asked. \"Well,\" said Parmalee, \"the boys laid off for to have some fun, an\u0027 it\u0027s done got so these times that when a feller wants fun he\u0027s got to git furder up the mounting.\" If the words were evasive, the tone was far more so, but Woodward paid little attention to either. He had the air of a man accustomed to being called up in the early hours of the morning to go forth on mysterious expeditions. A bright fire was blazing in Poteet\u0027s kitchen, and the light, streaming through the wide doorway, illuminated the tops of the trees on the edge of the clearing. Upon this background the shadows of the women, black and vast—Titanic indeed,—were projected as they passed to and fro. From within there came a sound as of the escape of steam from some huge engine; but the men waiting on the outside knew that the frying-pan was doing its perfect work. The meat sizzled and fried; the shadows in the tops of the trees kept up what seemed to be a perpetual promenade, and the men outside waited patiently and silently. This silence oppressed Woodward. He knew that but for his presence the mountaineers would be consulting together and cracking their dry jokes. In spite of the fact that he recognised in the curious impassiveness of these people the fundamental qualities of courage and endurance, he resented it as a barrier which he had never been able to break down. He would have preferred violence of some sort. He could meet rage with rage, and give blow for blow, but how was he to deal with the reserve by which he was surrounded? He was not physically helpless, by any means, but the fact that he had no remedy against the attitude of the men of Hog Mountain chafed him almost beyond endurance. He was emphatically a man of action—full of the enterprises usually set in motion by a bright mind, a quick temper, and ready courage; but, measured by the impassiveness which these men had apparently borrowed from the vast aggressive silences that give strength and grandeur to their mountains, how trivial, how contemptible all his activities seemed to be! But the frying was over after a while. The Titanic shadows went to roost in the tops of the trees, and Teague Poteet and his friends, including ex- Deputy Woodward, took themselves and their fried meat off up the mountain, and the raid followed shortly after. It was a carefully-planned raid, and deserved to be called a formidable one. Like many another similar enterprise it was a failure, so far as the purposes of the Government were concerned, but fate or circumstance made it famous in the political annals of that period. Fifteen men, armed with carbines, rode up the mountain. They were full of the spirit of adventure. They felt the strong arm of the law behind them. They knew they were depended upon to make some sort of demonstration, and this, together with a dram too much here and there, made them a trifle reckless and noisy. They had been taught to believe that they were in search of outlaws. They caught from the officers who organised them something of the irritation which was the natural result of so many fruitless attempts to bring Hog Mountain to terms. They betrayed a sad lack of discretion. They brandished their weapons in the frightened faces of women and children, and made many foolish mistakes which need not be detailed here. They rode noisily over the mountain, making a circle of Pullium\u0027s Summit, and found nothing. They peered over the precipitous verge of Prather\u0027s Mill Road, and saw nothing. They paused occasionally to listen, and heard nothing. They pounced upon a lonely pedlar who was toiling across the mountain with his pack upon his back, and plied him with questions concerning the Moonshiners. This pedlar appeared to be a very ignorant fellow indeed. He knew his name was Jake Cohen, and that was about all. He had never crossed Hog Mountain before, and, so help his gracious, he would never cross it again. The roads were all rough and the ladies were all queer. As for the latter—well, great Jingo! they would scarcely look at his most beautiful collection of shawls and ribbons and laces, let alone buy them. In Villa Bay (or, as Cohen called it, \"Feel Hooray\") he had heard that Teague Poteet had been arrested and carried to Atlanta by a man named Woodward. No one had told him this, but he heard people talking about it wherever he went in Villa Ray, and there seemed to be a good deal of excitement in the settlement. Cohen was a droll customer, the revenue officers thought, and the longer they chatted with him the droller he became. First and last they drew from him what they considered to be some very important information. But most important of all was the report of the arrest of Teague Poteet. The deputies congratulated themselves. They understood the situation thoroughly, and their course was perfectly plain. Poteet, in endeavouring to escape from them, had fallen into the clutches of Woodward, and their best plan was to overtake the latter before he reached Atlanta with his prize, and thus share in the honour of the capture. With this purpose in view, they took a dram all round and turned their horses\u0027 heads down the mountain. Cohen certainly was a droll fellow. He stood in the road until the revenue men had disappeared. Then he unbuckled the straps of his pack, dropped it upon the ground, and sat down upon a boulder. With his head between his hands, he appeared to be lost in thought, but he was only listening. He remained listening until after the sounds of the horses\u0027 feet had died away. Then he carried his precious pack a little distance from the roadside, covered it with leaves, listened a moment to be sure that the deputies were not returning, and then proceeded to a. little ravine in the side of the mountain where the Moonshiners lay. He had been waiting nearly two days where the revenue men found him, and his story of the capture of Teague Poteet was concocted for the purpose of sending the posse back down the mountain the way they came. If they had gone on a mile further they would have discovered signs of the Moonshiners, and this discovery would have led to a bloody encounter, if not to the capture of the leaders. The deputies rode down the mountain in the best of spirits. They had accomplished more than any other posse; they had frightened the Moonshiners of Hog Mountain to their hiding-places, and not a deputy had been killed, or even wounded. The clatter they made as they journeyed along attracted the attention of Ab Bonder, a boy about fifteen, who happened to be squirrel-hunting, and he stepped into the road to get a good view of them. He was well grown for his age, and his single-barrelled shot-gun looked like a rifle. The revenue men halted at once. They suspected an ambuscade. Experience had taught them that the Moonshiners would fight when the necessity arose, and they held a council of war. The great gawky boy, with the curiosity of youth and ignorance combined, stood in the road and watched them. When they proceeded toward him in a compact body, he passed on across the road. Hearing a command to halt, he broke into a run, and endeavoured to make his way across a small clearing that bordered the road. Several of the deputies fired their guns in the air, but one, more reckless than the rest, aimed directly at the fugitive, and Ab Bonner fell, shot through and through. Viewed in its relations to all the unfortunate events that have marked the efforts of the Government officials to deal with the violators of the revenue laws from a political point of view, the shooting of this ignorant boy was insignificant enough. But it was important to Hog Mountain. For a moment the deputy-marshals were stunned and horrified at the result of their thoughtlessness. Then they dismounted and bore the boy to the roadside again and placed him under the shade of a tree. His blood shone upon the leaves, and his sallow, shrunken face told a pitiful tale of terror, pain, and death. The deputy-marshals mounted their horses and rode steadily and swiftly down the mountain, and by nightfall they were far away. But there was no need of any special haste. The winds that stirred the trees could carry no messages. The crows flying over, though they made a great outcry, could tell no tales. Once the boy raised his hand and cried \"Mammy!\" but there was no one to hear him. And though ten thousand ears should listen, the keenest could hear him no more He became a part of the silence—the awful, mysterious silence—that sits upon the hills and shrouds the mountains. This incident in the tumultuous experience of Hog Mountain—the killing of Ab Bonner was merely an incident—had a decisive effect upon the movements of ex-Deputy Woodward. When Jake Cohen succeeded in turning the revenue officials back, the mountaineers made themselves easy for the day and night, and next morning prepared to go to their homes. Some of them lived on one side of Hog Mountain, and some on the other. They called themselves neighbours, and yet they lived miles apart, and it so happened that, with few exceptions, each went in a different direction. Teague Poteet gave the signal— \"Come, Cap,\" he said to Woodward, \"yess be a- traipsiu\u0027. Puss\u0027ll be a-puttin\u0027 on biskits for supper before we git thar if we don\u0027t push on. Be good to yourse\u0027f, boys, an\u0027 don\u0027t raise no fracas.\" Poteet and Woodward rode off together. That afternoon, half a mile from Poteet\u0027s, they met a woman running in the road, crying and wringing her hands wildly. She moved like one distracted. She rushed past them, crying— \"They uv killed little Ab! They uv killed him. Oh, Lordy! they uv killed little Ab!\" She ran up the road a little distance and then came running back; she had evidently recognised Poteet. As she paused in the road near them, her faded calico sun-bonnet hanging upon her shoulders, her grey hair falling about her face, her wrinkled arms writhing in response to a grief too terrible to contemplate, she seemed related in some vague way to the prophets of old who were assailed by fierce sorrows. Here was something more real and more awful than death itself. Woodward felt in his soul that the figure, the attitude, the misery of this poor old woman were all Biblical. \"Oh, Teague,\" she cried, \"they uv killed him! They uv done killed my little Ab! Oh, Lordy! that mortal hain\u0027t a-livin\u0027 that he ever done any harm. What did they kill him for?\" Then she turned to Woodward: \"Oh, Mister, Mister! please tell me what he done. I\u0027m the one that made the liquor, I\u0027m the one. Oh, Lordy! what did they kill little Ab for?\" Teague Poteet dismounted from his horse, took the woman firmly but gently by the arm, and made her sit down by the side of the road. Then, when she was more composed, she told the story of finding her son\u0027s body. It was a terrible story to hear from the lips of the mother, but she grew quieter after telling it, and presently went on her way. The two men watched her out of sight. \"I\u0027ll tell you what, Cap,\" said Teague, as he flung himself into the saddle, \"they er houndin\u0027 airter us. They er \u0027buzin\u0027 the wimmin an\u0027 killin\u0027 the childern; stidder carryin\u0027 out the law, they er gwine about a-shootin\u0027 an\u0027 a-murderin\u0027. So fur, so good. Well, now, lemme tell you: the hawk \u0027a done lit once too much in the chicken-lot. This is a free country. I hain\u0027t a-layin\u0027 no blame on you. Me an\u0027 Sis stood by you when the boys s\u0027ore they wuz a-gwine to rattle you up. We made \u0027em behave the\u0027rse\u0027ves, an\u0027 I hain\u0027t a-blamin\u0027 you, but they er houndin\u0027 airter us, an\u0027 ef I wuz you I wouldn\u0027t stay on this hill nary \u0027nuther minnit longer than it \u0027ud take me to git offn it. When the boys git wind er this ongodly bizness, they ull be mighty hard to hol\u0027. I reckon maybe you\u0027ll be a-gwine down about Atlanty. Well, you thes watch an\u0027 see what stan\u0027 the Government\u0027s gwineter take \u0027bout Ab Bonner, an\u0027 ef hit don\u0027t take no stan\u0027, you thes drap in thar an\u0027 tell \u0027em how you seed er ole man name Teague Poteet, an\u0027 he \u0027lowed that the revenue fellers better not git too clost ter Hog Mountain, bekaze the hidin\u0027-out bizness is done played. The law what\u0027s good enough fer pore little Ab Bonner is good enough fer the men what shot \u0027im.\" They rode on until they came to Poteet\u0027s house. \"We\u0027ll thes go in an\u0027 git a snack,\" said Teague, \"an\u0027 airter that your best gait is a gallop.\" But Woodward declined. He was dazed as well as humiliated, and he had no desire to face Sis Poteet. He pictured to himself the scorn and bitterness with which she would connect his presence on the Mountain with the murder of Ab Bonner, and he concluded to ride on to Gullettsville. He took Teague Poteet by the hand. \"Good-bye, old man,\" he said; \"I shall remember you. Tell Miss Sis—well, tell Miss Sis good-bye.\" With that he wheeled his horse and rode rapidly toward Gullettsville. It was a fortunate ride for him, perhaps. The wrath of Hog Mountain was mightily stirred when it heard of the killing of Ab Bonner, and Woodward would have fared badly at its hands. The wrath of others was stirred also. The unfortunate affair took the shape of a political issue, and thus the hands of justice were tied. But all this is a matter of history, and need not be dwelt upon. In the meantime, as the days passed, Teague Poteet became dimly and uncomfortably conscious that a great change had come over Sis. One day she would be as bright and as gay as the birds in the trees; the next, she would be quiet, taciturn, and apparently depressed. As Teague expressed, \"One minnit hit\u0027s Sis, an\u0027 the nex\u0027 hit\u0027s some un else.\" Gradually the fits of depression grew more and more frequent and lasted longer. She was abstracted and thoughtful, and her petulance disappeared altogether. The contrast resulting from this change was so marked that it would have attracted the attention of a person of far less intelligence than Teague Poteet. He endeavoured to discuss the matter with his wife, but Puss Poteet was not the woman to commit herself. She was a Mountain Sphinx. \"I\u0027m afeard Sis is ailin\u0027,\" said Teague, upon one occasion. \"Well,\" replied Puss, \"she ain\u0027t complainin\u0027.\" \"That\u0027s hit,\" Teague persisted; \"she hain\u0027t complainin\u0027. That\u0027s what pesters me. She looks lonesome, an\u0027 she\u0027s got one er them kinder fur-away looks in her eyes that gives me the all-overs.\" The Sphinx rubbed its snuff and swung in its rocking-chair. \"Some days she looks holp up, an\u0027 then ag\u0027in she looks cas\u0027 down. I \u0027low\u0027d maybe you mought know what ailed her.\" \"Men folks,\" said Puss, manipulating her snuff-swab slowly and deliberately, \"won\u0027t never have no sense while the worl\u0027 stan\u0027s. Ef a \u0027oman ain\u0027t gwine hether an\u0027 yan\u0027, rippity-clippity, day in an\u0027 day out, an\u0027 half the night, they er on the\u0027r heads. Wimmen hain\u0027t men.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" replied league gravely, \"they hain\u0027t. Ef they wuz, the men \u0027ud be in a mighty nice fix.\" \"They\u0027d have some sense,\" said Puss. \"Likely so. Yit \u0027oman er man kin sliet one eye an\u0027 tell that Sis looks droopy, an\u0027 when Sis looks droopy, I know in reason sump\u0027n\u0027 nuther ails her.\" \"Well, goodness knows; I wish in my soul somebody\u0027d shet one eye an\u0027 look at me,\" exclaimed Puss, with a touch of jealousy in her tone. \"I traipse \u0027roun\u0027 this hill ontell I\u0027m that wore out I kin skacely drag one foot alrter t\u0027other, an\u0027 I don\u0027t never hear nobody up an\u0027 ast what ails me. It\u0027s Sis, Sis, Sis, all the time, an\u0027 eternally. Ef the calf\u0027s fat, the ole cow ain\u0027t got much choice betwixt the quogmire an\u0027 the tan-vat.\" \"Lord, how you do run on,\" said the iron-grey giant, rubbing his knuckles together sheepishly. \"You don\u0027t know Sis ef you go on that away. Many\u0027s the time that chile \u0027ud foller me up an\u0027 say, \u0027Pap, ef you see my shawl a-haugin\u0027 out on the fence, Puss\u0027ll be asleep, an\u0027 don\u0027t you come a-lumberin\u0027 in an\u0027 wake her up, nuther.\u0027 An\u0027 many\u0027s the time she\u0027d come out an\u0027 meet me, an\u0027 up an\u0027 say, \u0027Pap, Puss has takin\u0027 an\u0027 bin a-mopin\u0027 all day long; yess you an\u0027 me go in an\u0027 fetch her up.\u0027 An\u0027 bless your life,\" Teague continued, addressing some imaginary person on the other side of the fireplace, \"when me an\u0027 Sis sets our heads for to fetch anybody up, they er thes natchully erbleeged ter come.\" Puss rubbed her snuff and swayed to and fro in her rocking-chair, disdaining to make any reply to this array of facts and arguments; and Teague was as ignorant as ever of the cause of the queer change in his daughter. Perhaps, as becomes a dutiful husband, he should have retorted upon his complaining wife with complaints of his own; but his interests and his isolation had made him thoughtful and forbearing. He had the trait of gentleness which frequently sweetens and equalises large natures. He remembered that behind whatever complaints—reasonable or unreasonable—Puss might make, there existed a stronghold of affection and tenderness; he remembered that her whole life had been made up of a series of small sacrifices; he knew that she was ready, whenever occasion made it necessary, to cast aside her snuff-swab and her complaints, and go to the rack without a murmur. But Teague was by no means satisfied with the condition of affairs, so far as Sis was concerned. He said no more to his wife, but he kept his eyes open. The situation was baffling to the point of irritation, but Teague betrayed neither uneasiness nor restlessness. He hung about the house more, and he would frequently walk in quietly when the women thought he was miles away. There were times when Sis ignored his presence altogether, but as a general thing she appeared to relish his companionship. Sometimes at night, after her mother had gone to bed, she would bring her chair close to Teague\u0027s, and rest her head upon his shoulder, while he smoked his pipe and gazed in the fire. Teague enjoyed these occasions to the utmost, and humoured his daughter\u0027s slightest wish, responding to her every mood and fancy. If she talked, he talked; if she was silent, he said nothing. Once she dropped asleep with her head on his arm, and Teague sat holding her thus half the night. When she did awake she upbraided herself so earnestly for imposing on her old pappy (as she called him) that Teague yawned, and stretched himself, and rubbed his eyes, and pretended that he, too, had been asleep. \"Lordy, honey! I wuz that gone tell I didn\u0027t know whe\u0027er I \u0027uz rolled up in a haystack er stretched out in a feather-bed. I reckon ef you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 listened right clost you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 heern me sno\u0027. I thes laid back an\u0027 howled at the rafters, an\u0027 once-t er twice-t I wuz afeard I mought waken up Puss.\" Sis\u0027s response to this transparent fib was an infectious peal of laughter, and a kiss which amply repaid Teague for any discomfort to which he may have been subjected. Once, after Sis had nestled up against Teague, she asked somewhat irrelevantly— \"Pap, do you reckon Mr. Woodward was a revenue spy after all?\" \"Well, not to\u0027rds the last. He drapped that business airter he once seed its which-aways. What makes you ast?\" \"Because I hate and despise revenue spies.\" \"Well, they hain\u0027t been a-botherin\u0027 roun lately, an\u0027 we hain\u0027t got no call to hate \u0027em tell they gits in sight. Hatin\u0027 is a mighty ha\u0027sh disease. When Puss\u0027s preacher comes along, he talks ag\u0027in it over the Bible, an\u0027 when you call \u0027im in to dinner, he talks ag\u0027in it over the chicken-bones. I reckon hit\u0027s mighty bad—mighty bad.\" \"Did you like him?\" \"Who? Puss\u0027s preacher?\" \"Now, you know I don\u0027t mean him, pap.\" \"Oh! Cap\u0027n Woodward. Well, I tell you what, he had mighty takin\u0027 ways. Look in his eye, an\u0027 you wouldn\u0027t see no muddy water; an\u0027 he had grit. They hain\u0027t no two ways about that. When I ast \u0027im out with us that night, he went like a man that had a stool to a quiltin\u0027-bee; an\u0027 when Duke Dawson an\u0027 Sid Parmalee flung out some er the\u0027r slurs, he thes snapt his fingers in the\u0027r face, an\u0027 ups an\u0027 says, says he, \u0027Gents, ef youer up for a frolic, I\u0027m your man, an\u0027 ef youer in for a fight, thes count me in,\u0027 says he. The boys wuz a little drinky,\" said Teague, apologetically. Sis squeezed up a little closer against her father\u0027s shoulder. \"Did they fight, pap?\" \"Lord bless you, no. I thes taken am\u0027 flung my han\u0027 in Duke\u0027s collar an\u0027 fetched \u0027im a shake er two, an put \u0027im in a good humour thereckly; an\u0027 then airterwerds Tip Watson sot \u0027em all right when he read out the letter you foun\u0027 on the floor.\" \"Oh, pap!\" Sis exclaimed in a horrified tone, \"I slapped that letter out of Mr. Woodward\u0027s hand!\" Teague laughed exultantly. \"What\u0027d he say?\" \"He didn\u0027t say anything. He looked like he expected the floor to open and swallow him. I never was so ashamed in my life. I\u0027ve cried about it a thousand times.\" \"Why, honey, I wouldn\u0027t take an\u0027 cry \u0027bout it ef I wuz you.\" \"Yes you would, pap, if—if—you were me. I don\u0027t know what came over me; I don\u0027t know how I could be so hateful. No lady would ever do such a thing as that.\" Sis gave her opinion with great emphasis. Teague took his pipe out of his mouth. \"Well, I tell you what, honey, they mought er done wuss. I let you know, when folks is got to be a-runnin\u0027 here an\u0027 a-hidin\u0027 yander, hit\u0027s thes about time for the gals for to lose the\u0027r manners. Nobody wouldn\u0027t a-blamed you much ef you\u0027d a-fetched the Cap\u0027n a clip stidder the letter; leastways, I wouldn\u0027t.\" The girl shivered and caught her breath. \"If I had hit him,\" she exclaimed vehemently, \"I should have gone off and killed myself.\" \"Shoo!\" said Teague in a tone intended to be at once contemptuous and reassuring, but it was neither the one nor the other. This conversation gave Teague fresh cause for anxiety. From his point of view, Sis\u0027s newly-developed humility was absolutely alarming, and it added to his uneasiness. He recognised in her tone a certain shyness which seemed to appeal to him for protection, and he was profoundly stirred by it without at all understanding it. With a tact that might be traced to either instinct or accident, he refrained from questioning her as to her troubles. He was confused, but watchful. He kept his own counsel, and had no more conferences with Puss. Perhaps Puss was also something of a mystery; if so, she was old enough to take care of her own affairs. Teague had other talks with Sis—some general, some half-confidential,—and he finally became aware of the fact that every subject led to Woodward. He humoured this, awkwardly but earnestly, and thought he had a clew, but it was a clew that pestered him more than ever. He turned it round in his mind and brooded over it. Woodward was a man of fine appearance and winning manners, and Sis, with all the advantages—comparative advantages merely—that the Gullettsville Academy had given her, was only a country girl after all. What if——? Teague turned away from the suspicion in terror. It was a horrible one; but as often as he put it aside, so often he returned to it. It haunted him. Turn where he might, go where he would, it pursued him night and day. One mild afternoon in the early spring, Mr. Philip Woodward, ex-deputy marshal, leaned against the railing of Broad Street bridge in the city of Atlanta, and looked northward to where Kennesaw Mountain rises like a huge blue billow out of the horizon and lends picturesqueness to the view. Mr. Woodward was in excellent humour. He had just made up his mind in regard to a matter that had given him no little trouble. A wandering prospector, the agent of a company of Boston capitalists, had told him a few hours before that he would be offered twenty thousand dollars for his land-lot on Hog Mountain. This was very important, but it was not of the highest importance. He nodded familiarly to Kennesaw, and thought: \"I\u0027ll slip by you to-morrow and make another raid on Hog Mountain, and compel that high-tempered girl to tell me what she means by troubling me so.\" A train of cars ran puffing and roaring under the bridge, and as Woodward turned to follow it with his eye he saw standing upon the other side a tall, gaunt, powerful-looking man, whom he instantly recognised as Teague Poteet. Teague wore the air of awkward, recklessly-helpless independence which so often deceives those who strike the mountain men for a trade. Swiftly crossing the bridge, Woodward seized Teague and greeted him with a cordiality that amounted to enthusiasm. \"Well, of all the world, old man, you are the one I most wanted to see.\" Teague\u0027s thoughts ran with grim directness to a reward that had been offered for a certain grey old Moonshiner who had made his headquarters on Hog Mountain. \"How are all at home?\" Woodward went on, \"and what is the news?\" \"The folks is porely and puny,\" Teague replied, \"an\u0027 the news won\u0027t skacely b\u0027ar relatin\u0027. I hain\u0027t a-denyin\u0027,\" he continued, rubbing his chin and looking keenly at the other, \"I hain\u0027t a-denyin\u0027 but what I\u0027m a-huntin\u0027 airter you, an\u0027 the business I come on hain\u0027t got much howdyin\u0027 in it. Ef you uv got some place er nuther wher\u0027 ever\u0027body hain\u0027t a-cockin\u0027 up the\u0027r years at us, I\u0027d like to pass some words wi\u0027 you.\" \"Why, of course,\" exclaimed Woodward, hooking his arm in Teague\u0027s. \"We\u0027ll go to my room. Come! And after we get through, if you don\u0027t say that my business with you is more important than your business with me, then I\u0027ll agree to carry you to Hog Mountain on my back. Now that\u0027s a fair and reasonable proposition. What do you say?\" Woodward spoke with unusual warmth, and there was a glow of boyish frankness in his tone and manners that Teague found it hard to resist. \"Well, they\u0027s thes this much about it,\" he said; \"my business is mighty troublesome, an\u0027 yit hit\u0027s got to be settled up.\" He had put a revolver in his pocket on account of this troublesome business. \"So is mine troublesome,\" responded Woodward, laughing, and then growing serious. \"It has nearly worried me to death.\" Presently they reached Woodward\u0027s room, which was up a flight of stairs near the corner of Broad and Alabama Streets. It was a very plain apartment, but comfortably furnished, and kept with scrupulous neatness. \"Now, then,\" said Woodward, when Teague had seated himself, \"I\u0027ll settle my business, and then you can settle yours.\" He had seated himself in a chair, but he got up, shook himself, and walked around the room nervously. The lithograph of a popular burlesque actress stared brazenly at him from the mantelpiece. He took this remarkable work of art, folded it across the middle, and threw it into the grate. \"I\u0027ve had more trouble than enough,\" he went on, \"and if I hadn\u0027t met you to-day I intended to hunt you up to-morrow.\" \"In Atlanty?\" \"No; on Hog Mountain. Oh, I know the risk,\" Woodward exclaimed, misinterpreting Teague\u0027s look of surprise. \"I know all about that, but I was going just the same. Has Miss Sis ever married?\" he asked, stopping before Teague and blushing like a girl. \"Not less\u0027n it happened sence last We\u0027n\u0027sday, an\u0027 that hain\u0027t noways likely,\" replied the other, with more interest than he had yet shown. Woodward\u0027s embarrassment was more impressive than his words. \"I hardly know how to say it,\" he continued, \"but what I wanted to ask you was this: Suppose I should go up to Hog Mountain some fine morning, and call on you, and say, as the fellow did in the song, \u0027Old man, old man, give me your daughter,\u0027 and you should reply, \u0027Go upstairs and take her if you want to,\u0027 what do you suppose the daughter would say?\" Woodward tried in vain to give an air of banter to his words. Teague leaned forward with his hands upon his knees. \"Do you mean, would Sis marry you?\" he asked. \"That is just exactly what I mean,\" Woodward replied. The old mountaineer rose and stretched himself, and drew a deep sigh of relief. His horrible suspicion had no foundation. He need not fly to the mountains with Woodward\u0027s blood upon his hands. \"Lemme tell you the honest truth, Cap,\" he said, placing his hand kindly on the young man\u0027s shoulder. \"I might \u0027low she would, an\u0027 I might \u0027low she wouldn\u0027t; but I\u0027m erbleege to tell you that I dunno nothin\u0027 \u0027bout that chil\u0027 no more\u0027n ef I hadn\u0027t a-never seed \u0027er. Wimmin is mighty kuse.\" \"Yes,\" said Woodward, \"they are curious.\" \"Some days they er gwine rippitin\u0027 aroun\u0027 like the woods wuz afire, an\u0027 then ag\u0027in they er mopin\u0027 an\u0027 a-moonin\u0027 like ever\u0027 minnit wuz a-gwine to be the nex\u0027. I bin a-studyin\u0027 Sis sence she wan\u0027t no bigger\u0027n a skinned rabbit, an\u0027 yit I hain\u0027t got to A, B, C, let alone a-b ab, u-b ub. When a man lays off for to keep up wi\u0027 the wimmiu folks, he kin thes make up his min\u0027 that he\u0027ll have to git in a dark corner an\u0027 scratch his head many a time when he oughter be a-diggin\u0027 for his livin\u0027. They\u0027ll addle \u0027im thereckly.\" \"Well,\" said Woodward, with an air of determination, \"I\u0027m going back with you and hear what Miss Sis has to say. Sit down. Didn\u0027t you say you wanted to see me on business?\" \"I did start out wi\u0027 that idee,\" said Teague, slipping into a chair and smiling curiously, \"but I disremember mostly what \u0027twuz about. Ever\u0027thing is been a-pesterin\u0027 me lately, an\u0027 a man that\u0027s hard-headed an\u0027 long-legged picks up all sorts er foolish notions. I wish you\u0027d take keer this pickle-bottle, Cap,\" he continued, drawing a revolver from his coat-tail pocket and placing it on the table. \"I uv bin afeard ever sence I started out that the blamed thing \u0027ud go off an\u0027 far my jacket wrong-sud-outerds. Gimme a gun, an\u0027 you\u0027ll gener\u0027lly fin\u0027 me somewheres aroun\u0027; but them ar cliokety-cluckers is got mos\u0027 too many holes in \u0027em for to suit my eyesight.\" Usually, it is a far cry from Atlanta to Hog Mountain, but Teague Poteet and Woodward lacked the disposition of loiterers. They shortened the distance considerably by striking through the country, the old mountaineer remarking that if the big road would take care of itself he would try and take care of himself. They reached Poteet\u0027s one afternoon, creating a great stir among the dogs and geese that were sunning themselves outside the yard. Sis had evidently seen them coming, and was in a measure prepared; but she blushed painfully when Woodward took her hand, and she ran into her father\u0027s arms with a little hysterical sob. \"Sis didn\u0027t know a blessed word \u0027bout my gwine off to Atlanty,\" said Teague awkwardly but gleefully. \"Did you, honey?\" Sis looked from one to the other for an explanation. Woodward was smiling the broad, unembarrassed smile of the typical American lover, and Teague was laughing. Suddenly it occurred to her that her father, divining her secret—her sweet, her bitter, her well-guarded secret—had sought Woodward out and begged him to return. The thought filled her with such shame and indignation as only a woman can experience. She seized Teague by the arm— \"Pap, have you been to Atlanta?\" \"Yes, honey, an\u0027 I made \u0027as\u0027e to come back.\" \"Oh, how could you? How dare you do such a thing!\" she exclaimed passionately. \"I will never forgive you as long as I live—never!\" \"Why, honey——\" But she was gone, and neither Teague nor her mother could get a word of explanation from her. Teague coaxed, and wheedled, and threatened, and Puss cried and quarrelled; but Sis was obdurate. She shut herself in her room and remained there. Woodward was thoroughly miserable. He felt that he was an interloper in some measure, and yet he was convinced that he was the victim of a combination of circumstances for which he was in nowise responsible. He had never made any special study of the female mind, because, like most young men of sanguine temperament, he was convinced that he thoroughly understood it; but he had not the remotest conception of the tragic element which, in spite of social training or the lack of it, controls and gives strength and potency to feminine emotions. Knowing nothing of this, Woodward knew nothing of women. The next morning he was stirring early, but he saw nothing of Sis. He saw nothing of her during the morning, and at last, in the bitterness of his disappointment, he saddled his horse, and made preparations to go down the mountain. \"I reckon it hain\u0027t no use to ast you to make out your visit,\" said Teague gloomily. \"That\u0027s what I says to Puss. I\u0027m a free nigger ef Sis don\u0027t beat my time. You\u0027ll be erbleege to stop in Gullettsville to-night, an\u0027 in case er accidents you thes better tie this on your coat.\" The old mountaineer produced a small piece of red woollen string, and looped it in Woodward\u0027s button-hole. \"Ef any er the boys run up wi\u0027 you an\u0027 begin to git limber-jawed,\" league continued, \"thes hang your thum\u0027 in that kinder keerless like, an\u0027 they\u0027ll sw\u0027ar by you thereekly. Ef any of \u0027em asts the news, thes say they\u0027s a leak in Sugar Creek. Well, well, well!\" he exclaimed, after a little pause; \"hit\u0027s thes like I tell you. Wimmin folks is mighty kuse.\" When Woodward bade Puss good-bye, she looked at him sympathetically and said— \"Sometime when youer passin\u0027 by, I\u0027d be mighty thankful ef you \u0027ud fetch me some maccaboy snuff.\" The young man, unhappy as he was, was almost ready to accuse Mrs. Poteet of humour, and he rode off with a sort of grim desire to laugh at himself and the rest of the world. The repose of the mountain fretted him; the vague blue mists that seemed to lift the valleys into prominence and carry the hills further away, tantalised him; and the spirit of spring, just touching the great woods with a faint suggestion of green, was a mockery. There was a purpose—a decisiveness—in the stride of his horse that he envied, and yet he was inclined to resent the swift amiability with which the animal moved away. But it was a wise steed, for when it came upon Sis Poteet standing by the side of the road, it threw up its head and stopped. Woodward lifted his hat, and held it in his hand. She gave him one little glance, and then her eyes drooped. \"I wanted to ask you something,\" she said, pulling a dead leaf to pieces. Her air of humility was charming. She hesitated a moment, but Woodward was too much astonished to make any reply. \"Are you very mad?\" she asked with bewitching inconsequence. \"Why should I be mad, Miss Sis? I am glad you have given me the opportunity to ask your pardon for coming up here to worry you.\" \"I wanted to ask you if pap—I mean, if father went to Atlanta to see you,\" she said, her eyes still bent upon the ground. \"He said he wanted to see me on business,\" Woodward replied. \"Did he say anything about me?\" \"Not that I remember. He never said anything about his business even,\" Woodward went on. \"I told him about some of my little troubles, and when he found I was coming back here, he seemed to forget all about his own business. I suppose he saw that I wouldn\u0027t be much interested in anybody else\u0027s business but my own just then.\" Sis lifted her head and looked steadily at Woodward. A little flush appeared in her cheeks, and mounted to her forehead, and then died away. \"Pap doesn\u0027t understand—I mean he doesn\u0027t understand everything, and I was afraid he had——Why do you look at me so?\" she exclaimed, stopping short, and blushing furiously. \"I ask your pardon,\" said the young man; \"I was trying to catch your meaning. You say you were afraid your father——\" \"Oh, I am not afraid now. Don\u0027t you think the weather is nice?\" Woodward was a little puzzled, but he was not embarrassed. He swung himself off his horse and stood beside her. \"I told your father,\" he said, drawing very near to the puzzling creature that had so wilfully eluded him—\"I told your father that I was coming up here to ask his daughter to marry me. What does the daughter say?\" She looked up in his face. The earnestness she saw there dazzled and conquered her. Her head drooped lower, and she clasped her hands together. He changed his tactics. \"Is it really true, then, that you hate me?\" \"Oh! if you only knew!\" she cried, and with that Woodward caught her in his arms. An hour afterwards, Teague Poteet, sitting in his low piazza, cleaning and oiling his rifle, heard the sound of voices coming from the direction of the Gullettsville road. Presently Sis and Woodward came in sight. They walked slowly along in the warm sunshine, wholly absorbed in each other. Woodward was leading his horse, and that intelligent animal improved the opportunity to nip the fragrant sassafras buds just appearing on the bushes. Teague looked at the two young people from under the brim of his hat and chuckled, but when Sis caught sight of him, a little while after, he was rubbing his rifle vigorously, and seemed to be oblivious to the fact that two young people were making love to each other in full view. But Sis blushed all the same, and the blushes increased as she approached the house, until Woodward thought in his soul that her rosy shyness was the rarest manifestation of loveliness to be seen in all the wide world. As she hovered a moment at the gate, blushing and smiling, the old mountaineer turned the brim of his hat back from his eyes and called out with a great pretence of formal hospitality— \"Walk in an\u0027 rest yourselves; thes walk right in! Hit\u0027s lots too soon in the season for the dogs to bite. Looks to me, Cap, like you hain\u0027t so mighty tender wi\u0027 that \u0027ar hoss er your\u0027n. Ef you uv rid \u0027im down to Gullettsville an\u0027 back sence a while ago, he\u0027ll be a-needin\u0027 feed thereckly. Thes come right in an\u0027 make yourselves at home.\" Woodward laughed sheepishly, but Sis rushed across the yard, flung her arms around Teague\u0027s neck, and fell to crying with a vehemence that would have done credit to the most broken-hearted of damsels. The grizzled old mountaineer gathered the girl to his bosom and stroked her hair gently, as he had done a thousand times before. He looked at Woodward with glistening eyes. \"Don\u0027t min\u0027 Sis, Cap. Sis hain\u0027t nothin\u0027 but a little bit of a slip of a gal, an\u0027 sence the day she could toddle \u0027roun\u0027 an\u0027 holler—good news or bad, mad er glad—she\u0027s bin a-runnin\u0027 an\u0027 havin\u0027 it out wi\u0027 her ole pappy. Wimmen an\u0027 gals hain\u0027t like we all, Cap; they er mighty kuse. She never pestered wi\u0027 Puss much,\" continued league, as his wife came upon the scene, armed with the plaintive air of slouchiness, which is at once the weapon and shield of women who believe that they are martyrs—\"she never pestered wi\u0027 Puss much, but, cry or laugh, fight or frolic, she allers tuck it out on her ole pappy.\" Puss asked no questions. She went and stood by Teague, and toyed gently with one of Sis\u0027s curls. \"Sis don\u0027t take airter none er the Pringles,\" she said after a while, by way of explanation. \"They hain\u0027t never bin a day when I couldn\u0027t look at Teague \u0027thout battin\u0027 my eyes, an\u0027 ma use to say she \u0027uz thes that away \u0027bout pap. I never know\u0027d what the all-overs wuz tell thes about a hour before me an\u0027 Teague wuz married. We \u0027uz thes about ready for to go an\u0027 face the preacher, when ma comes a-rushin\u0027 in—an\u0027 she won\u0027t never be no paler when she\u0027s laid out than she wuz right that minnit. \u0027In the name er the Lord, ma, is you seed a ghost?\u0027 s\u0027 I. \u0027Puss!\u0027 se\u0027 she, \u0027the cake hain\u0027t riz!\u0027 I thes tell you what, folks, I like to a-went through the floor—that I did!\" At this Sis looked up and laughed, and they all laughed except Puss, who eyed Woodward with an air of faint curiosity, and dryly remarked— \"I reckon you hain\u0027t brung me my maccaboy snuff. I lay me an\u0027 my snuff wan\u0027t in your min\u0027. \u0027Let the old hen cluck,\u0027 ez the sparrer-hawk said when he courted the pullet. Well,\" she continued, smiling with genuine satisfaction as she saw that Woodward no more than half-relished the comparison, \"I better be seein\u0027 about dinner. Ol\u0027 folks like me can\u0027t live on love.\" The days that followed were very happy ones for the two young people—and for the two old people for that matter. Teague enjoyed the situation immensely. He would watch the young lovers from afar, and then go off by himself and laugh heartily at his own conceits. He was very proud that Sis was going to marry Somebody—a very broad term, as the old mountaineer employed it. At night when they all sat around the fire (spring on Hog Mountain bore no resemblance to summer) Teague gave eager attention to Woodward\u0027s stories, and laughed delightedly at his silliest jokes. If Teague was delighted with Woodward, he was astounded at Sis. She was no longer the girl that her surroundings seemed to call for. She was a woman, and a very delightful one. From the old scholar, whom fate or circumstance had sent to preside over the Gullettsville Academy, she had caught something of the flavour and grace of cultivation—a gentle dignity, leaning always to artlessness, and a quick appreciation, which was in itself a rare accomplishment. The day for the wedding was set, and Woodward went his way to Atlanta. He had urged that the ceremony be a very quiet one, but Teague had different views, and he beat down all opposition. \"Why, good Lord, Cap\u0027.\" he exclaimed, \"what \u0027ud the boys say?—Poteet\u0027s gal married an\u0027 no stools [Footnote: Invitations] give out! No, siree! Not much. We hain\u0027t that stripe up here, Cap. We hain\u0027t got no quality ways, but we allers puts on the pot when comp\u0027ny comes. Me an\u0027 Sis an\u0027 Puss hain\u0027t had many weddin\u0027s \u0027mongst us, an\u0027 we\u0027re thes a-gwine to try an\u0027 put the bes\u0027 foot foremos\u0027. Oh no, Cap! You fetch your frien\u0027s an\u0027 we\u0027ll fetch our\u0027n, an\u0027 ef the house hain\u0027t roomy enough, bless you, the woods is.\" When Hog Mountain heard the news, which it did by special messenger, sent from house to house with little pink missives written by Sis, it was as proud as Teague himself. Fat Mrs. Hightower laid aside her spectacles when the invitation was translated to her, and remarked— \"They hain\u0027t nobody on the face er the yeth good enough fer Sis, but that air feller\u0027s got the looks an\u0027 the spunk. I\u0027ll set in this very day an\u0027 hour, an\u0027 I\u0027ll bake Sis a cake that\u0027ll make the\u0027r eyes water.\" And so it went. Everybody on Hog Mountain had some small contributions to make. The wedding, however, was not as boisterous as the boys proposed to make it. They had their frolic, to be sure, as Sid Parmalee or Tip Watson will tell you, but an incident occurred which took the edge off their enjoyment, and gave them the cue of soberness. Two of Woodward\u0027s friends—young men from Atlanta—bore him company to Hog Mountain. At Gullettsville they fell in with Uncle Jake Norris, at all times a jovial and companionable figure. \"Roundabout man, roundabout way,\" remarked Uncle Jake, by way of explaining his presence in Gullettsville. \"My house is away an\u0027 beyan\u0027 frum Poteet\u0027s, but I says to myself, s\u0027 I, in obejunce to the naked demands of the law I\u0027ll go this day an\u0027 git me a jug er licker that\u0027s bin stomped by the Govunment, an\u0027 hide it an\u0027 my wickedness, ez you may say, in league\u0027s hoss-stable. Yes, frien\u0027s, them wuz the words. \u0027Let the licker be stomped by the Govunment for the sakes of the young chap,\u0027 s\u0027 I, \u0027an\u0027 I\u0027ll hide the jug along er my wickedness in Teague\u0027s hoss-stable.\u0027 So then, frien\u0027s, yess be a sojourneyin\u0027, an\u0027 ef you feel the needance er somethin\u0027 quick an\u0027 strong for to brace you for endurance, make your way to the lot, an\u0027 feel behin\u0027 the stable- door—an\u0027 watch out for the kickin\u0027 mule! I give you my intentionals cle\u0027r an\u0027 clean. What does St. Paul say?—\u0027Ef you can\u0027t do good by slippance, do it by stealth.\u0027\" They journeyed along as rapidly as the nature of the mountain road would permit, but before they reached Poteet\u0027s the shadows of twilight began to deepen. The road, like most mountain roads, wound itself painfully about. At one point they were within a short half-mile of Poteet\u0027s, but a towering wall of rock barred their approach. The road, accommodating itself to circumstances, allowed the towering wall to drive it three miles out of the way. Uncle Jake Norris, turning readily to reminiscences, connected the precipitous shelf with many of the mysterious disappearances that had at various times occurred in army and revenue circles. \"Natur\u0027 built it,\" he said lightly, \"an\u0027 a jaybird showed it to the boys. Teague, up thar, he \u0027lowed that a man wi\u0027 grey eyes an\u0027 a nimble han\u0027 could git on that rock an\u0027 lay flat of his belly an\u0027 disembowel a whole army. Them wuz his words—disembowel a whole army.\" While Uncle Jake was speaking, the travellers had passed beyond the wall, but the declivity on their left was still too steep to accommodate the highway, and so they rode along with the shadows of night on one side of them and pale symptoms of the day on the other. Suddenly a thin stream of fire, accompanied by the sharp crack of a rifle, shot out of the side of the mountain straight at Woodward, and seemed, as one of his companions said afterwards, to pass through him. His horse shied with a tremendous lurch, and Woodward fell to the ground. \"He is shot!\" cried one of the young men. \"What devil\u0027s work is this?\" exclaimed Uucle Jake. \"Cap, you ain\u0027t hurt, is you?\" Receiving no reply, for Woodward was stunned into semi-unconsciousness, Uncle Jake addressed himself to the bushes— \"Come forth,\" he cried. \"Jestify this deed!\" There was a moment\u0027s silence, but not a moment\u0027s inaction. Uncle Jake leaped from his horse, and, telling the frightened yoxing men to look after Woodward, ran up the mountain-side a quarter of a mile, placed his hands to his mouth, and hallooed three times in rapid succession. Then he heard Poteet\u0027s dogs bark, and he hallooed again. This time he was answered from above, and he turned and ran back to where he left Woodward. When he got there he beheld a sight and heard words that made his blood run cold. Woodward was still lying upon the ground, but by his side was kneeling a gaunt and hollow-eyed woman. Her thin grey hair hung loose upon her shoulders and about her eyes, and the ragged sleeves of her gown fluttered wildly as she flung her bony arms in the air. She was uttering loud cries. \"Oh, Lordy! it\u0027s little Ab! I uv done killed little Ab over ag\u0027in! Oh, my little Ab! It\u0027s your pore ole mammy, honey! Oh, Mister! make little Ab wake up an\u0027 look at his pore ole mammy!\" The two young men from Atlanta were paralysed with horror. When Uncle Jake Norris ran up the mountain to alarm Poteet, the witch-like figure of the woman sprang from the bushes and fell upon Woodward with a loud outcry. The whole occurrence, so strange, so unnatural, and so unexpected, stripped the young men of their power of reasoning; and if the rocks had opened and fiery flames issued forth, their astonishment and perplexity and terror could have been no greater. But if they had been acquainted with the history of this wild-eyed woman,—if they had known that for weeks she had been wandering over the mountain bereft of reason, and seeking an opportunity to avenge with her own hands the murder of Ab Bonner, her son,—they would have been overcome by pity. Uncle Jake Norris understood at once that Ab Bonner\u0027s mother had shot Woodward, and he forgot to be merciful. \"Woe unto you, woman, ef you have done this deed! Woe unto you an\u0027 your\u0027n, Rachel Bonner, ef you have murdered this innocent!\" \"That he wuz innocent!\" exclaimed the woman, swaying back and forth and waving her hands wildly. \"The unborn babe wan\u0027t no innocenter than little Ab!\" \"Woe unto you, Sister Bonner!\" Uncle Jake went on, examining Woodward and speaking more calmly when he found him breathing regularly. \"Woe unto you, and shame upon you, Sister Bonner, to do this deed of onjestifiable homicide, ez I may say. Let flesh an\u0027 min\u0027 rankle, but shed no blood.\" \"Oh, my little Ab! I uv kilt \u0027im ag\u0027in!\" \"You may well sesso, Sister Rachel Bonner,\" said Uncle Jake, turning Woodward over and examining him with the crude skill of an old soldier; \"you may well sesso. Drap down where you is, an\u0027 call on the Lord not to give you over to a reprobate min\u0027 for to do the things that were unconvenient, ez St. Paul says. Let tribulation work patience, lest you git forsook of hope, Sister Jane Bonner. Come, Cap,\" he went on, addressing himself to Woodward, \"Teague\u0027ll be a drappin\u0027 on us, thereckly, an\u0027 it twon\u0027t never do in the roun\u0027 worl\u0027 for to be a-makin\u0027 faces at \u0027im frum the groun\u0027. Roust up, roust up.\" Woodward did rouse up. In fact his unconsciousness was only momentary, but he had been making a vain effort to trace his surroundings, disordered as they were by the wild cribs of the woman, to a reasonable basis. By the time he had been helped to his feet, and had discovered that the bullet from Mrs. Bonner\u0027s rifle had merely grazed the fleshy part of his shoulder, Teague and a number of his friends had arrived upon the scene. There was nothing to be said, nothing to be done, except to move up the mountain to Poteet\u0027s. \"Ah, pore woman!\" exclaimed Uncle Jake. \"Pore mizerbul creetur! Come wi\u0027 us, Sister Jane Bonner, come wi\u0027 us. Ther\u0027s a warm place at Teague\u0027s h\u0027a\u0027th fer sech ez you.\" The woman followed readily, keeping close to Woodward. To her distracted eyes he took the shape of her murdered son. Poteet was strangely reticent. His tremendous stride carried him ahead of the horses, and he walked with his head held down, as if reflecting. Once he turned and spoke to Parmalee— \"Oh, Sid!\" \"Ah-yi?\" \u0027S\u0027posen it had thes a bin a man?\u0027 \"Good-bye, Mr. Man!\" It is not necessary to describe the marriage of Sis and Woodward, or to recite here the beautiful folk-songs that served for the wedding music. As Mrs. Poteet remarked after it was all over, \"They wer\u0027n\u0027t a bobble frum beginnin\u0027 to en\u0027;\" and when the wedding party started down the mountain in the early hours of the morning to take conveyances at Gullettsville for the railroad station, thirty miles away, Uncle Jake Norris was sober enough to stand squarely on his feet as he held Sis\u0027s hand. \"Ez St. Paul says, I prophesy in perportion to my faith. You all is obleege to be happy. Take keer of thish \u0027ere gal, Cap!\" Teague Poteet went down the mountain a little way, and returned after a while like a man in a dream. He paused at a point that overlooked the valley and took off his hat. The morning breeze, roused from its sleep, stirred his hair. The world, plunging swiftly and steadily through its shadow, could not rid itself of a star that burned and quivered in the east. It seemed to be another world toward which Sis was going. An old woman, grey-haired, haggard, and sallow, who had been drawn from the neighbourhood of Hog Mountain by the managers of the Atlanta Cotton Exposition to aid in illustrating the startling contrasts that the energy and progress of man have produced, had but one vivid remembrance of that remarkable display. She had but one story to tell, and, after the Exposition was over, she rode forty miles on horseback, in the mud and rain, to tell it at Teague Poteet\u0027s. \"I wish I may die,\" she exclaimed, flinging the corners of her shawl back over her shoulders and dipping her clay pipe in the glowing embers—\"I wish I may die ef I ever see sech gangs, an\u0027 gangs, an\u0027 gangs of folks, an\u0027 ef I git the racket out\u0027n my head by next Chris\u0027mas, I\u0027ll be mighty lucky. They sot me over ag\u0027in the biggest fuss they could pick out, an\u0027 gimme a pa\u0027r er cotton kyards. Here\u0027s what kin kyard when she gits her han\u0027 in, an\u0027 I b\u0027leeve\u0027n my soul I kyarded \u0027nuff bats to thicken all the quilts betwix\u0027 this an\u0027 Californy. The folks, they \u0027ud come an\u0027 stan\u0027, an\u0027 star\u0027, an\u0027 then they \u0027ud go some\u0027rs else; an\u0027 then new folks \u0027ud come an\u0027 stan\u0027, an\u0027 star\u0027, an\u0027 go some\u0027rs else. They wuz jewlarkers thar frum ever\u0027wheres, an\u0027 they lookt like they wuz too brazen to live skacely. Not that I keer\u0027d. No, bless you! Not when folks is a plumpin\u0027 down the cash money. Not me! No, siree! I wuz a-settin\u0027 thar one day a-kyardin\u0027 away, a-kyardin\u0027 away, when all of a sudden some un retched down\u0027 an\u0027 grabbed me \u0027roun\u0027 the neck, an\u0027 bussed me right here on the jaw. Now, I hain\u0027t a-tellin\u0027 you no lie, I like to \u0027a\u0027 fainted. I lookt up, an\u0027 who do you reckon it wuz?\" \"I bet a hoss,\" said Teague dryly, \"that Sis wa\u0027n\u0027t fur from thar when that bussin\u0027 wuz a- gwine on.\" \"Who should it be but Sis!\" exclaimed the old woman, leaning forward eagerly as she spoke. \"Who else but Sis wuz a-gwine to grab me an\u0027 gimme a buss right here on the jaw, a-frontin\u0027 of all them jewlarkers? When I lookt up an\u0027 seen it twuz Sis, I thought in my soul she \u0027uz the purtiest creetur I ever laid eyes on. \u0027Well, the Lord love you, Sis,\u0027 s\u0027 I; \u0027whar on the face er the yeth did you drap frum?\u0027 s\u0027 I. I ketched \u0027er by the arm an\u0027 belt \u0027er off, an\u0027 s\u0027 I, \u0027Ef I don\u0027t have a tale to tell when I git home, no \u0027oman never had none,\u0027 s\u0027 I. She took an\u0027 buss\u0027d me right frontin\u0027 of all them jewlarkers, an\u0027 airter she \u0027uz gone I sot down an\u0027 had a good cry. That I did. I sot right whar I wuz, an\u0027 had a good cry.\" And then the old woman fell to crying softly at the remembrance of it, and those who had listened to her story cried with her. And narrow as their lives were, the memory of the girl seemed to sweeten and inspire all who sat around the wide hearth that night at Teague Poteet\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2807/77578.html","bookId":506,"book":{"id":506,"title":"Mingo And Other Sketches in Black and White","description":"简介： IN 1876, circumstances, partly accidental and partly sentimental, led me to revisit Crooked Creek Church, near the little village of Rockville, in Middle Georgia.
