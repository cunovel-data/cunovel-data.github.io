{"id":21686,"no":3,"title":"A PIECE OF LAND.","content":"THE history of Pinetucky District in Putnam County is preserved in tradition only, but its records are not less savoury on that account. The settlement has dispersed and disappeared, and the site of it is owned and occupied by a busy little man, who wears eye-glasses and a bob-tailed coat, and who is breeding Jersey cattle and experimenting with ensilage. It is well for this little man\u0027s peace of mind that the dispersion was an accomplished fact before he made his appearance. The Jersey cattle would have been winked at, and the silo regarded as an object of curiosity; but the eye-glasses and the bob- tailed coat would not have been tolerated. But if Pinetucky had its peculiarities, it also had its advantages. It was pleased with its situation and surroundings, and was not puzzled, as a great many people have since been, as to the origin of its name. In brief, Pinetucky was satisfied with itself. It was a sparsely settled neighbourhood, to be sure, but the people were sociable and comparatively comfortable. They could remain at home, so to speak, and attend the militia musteri, and they were in easy reach of a church- building which was not only used by all denominations—Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians—as a house of worship, but was made to serve as a schoolhouse. So far as petty litigation was concerned, Squire Ichabod Inchly, the wheel-wright, was prepared to hold justice-court in the open air in front of his shop when the weather wag fine, and in any convenient place when the weather was foul. \"Gentlemen,\" he would say, when a case came before him, \"I\u0027d a heap ruther shoe a horse or shrink a tire; yit if you will have the law, I\u0027ll try and temper it wi\u0027 jestice.\" This was the genuine Pinetucky spirit, and all true Pinetuckians tried to live up to it. When occasion warranted, they followed the example of larger communities, and gossiped about each other; but rural gossip is oftener harmless than not; besides, it is a question whether gossip does not serve a definite moral purpose. If our actions are to be taken note of by people whose good opinion is worth striving for, the fact serves as a motive and a cue for orderly behaviour. Yet it should be said that the man least respected by the Pinetuckians was the man least gossiped about. This was Bradley Gaither, the richest man in the neighbourhood. With few exceptions, all the Pinetuckians owned land and negroes; but Bradley Gaither owned more land and more negroes than the most of them put together. No man, to all appearances, led a more correct life than Bradley Gaither. He was first at church, and the last to leave; he even affected a sort of personal interest in politics; but the knack of addressing himself to the respect and esteem of his neighbours he lacked altogether. He was not parsimonious, but, as Squire Inchly expressed it, \"narrer-minded in money matters.\" He had the air of a man who is satisfied with himself rather than with the world, and the continual exhibition of this species of selfishness is apt to irritate the most simple-minded spectator. Lacking the sense of humour necessary to give him a knowledge of his own relations to his neighbours, he lived under the impression that he was not only one of the most generous of men, but the most popular. He insisted upon his rights. If people made bad bargains when they traded with him—and he allowed them to make no other kind,—they must stand or fall by them. Where his lands joined those of his neighbours, there was always \"a lane for the rabbits,\" as the saying is. He would join fences with none of them. Indeed, he was a surly neighbour, though he did not even suspect the fact. He had one weakness,—a greed for land. If he drove hard bargains, it was for the purpose of adding to his landed possessions. He overworked and underfed his negroes in order that he might buy more land. Day and night he toiled, and planned, and pinched himself and the people around him to gratify his land- hunger. Bradley Gaither had one redeeming feature,—his daughter Rose. For the sake of this daughter Pinetueky was willing to forgive him a great many things. To say that Rose Gaither was charming or lovely, and leave the matter there, would ill become even the casual historian of Pinetucky. She was lovely, but her loveliness was of the rare kind that shows itself in strength of character as well as in beauty of form and feature. In the appreciative eyes of the Pinetuckians she seemed to invest womanhood with a new nobility. She possessed dignity without vanity, and her candour was tempered by a rare sweetness that won all hearts. She carried with her that mysterious flavour of romance that belongs to the perfection of youth and beauty; and there are old men in Rockville to-day, sitting in the sunshine on the street corners and dreaming of the past, whose eyes will kindle with enthusiasm at mention of Rose Gaither\u0027s name. But in 1840 Bradley Gaither\u0027s beautiful daughter was not by any means the only representative of womankind in Pinetucky. There was Miss Jane Inchly, to go no further. Miss Jane was Squire Inchly\u0027s maiden sister; and though she was neither fat nor fair, she was forty. Perhaps she was more than forty; but if she was fifty she was not ashamed of it. She had a keen eye and a sharp tongue, and used both with a freedom befitting her sex and her experience. Squire Inchly\u0027s house was convenient to his shop; and just opposite lived the Carews, father and son, once the most prosperous and prominent family in the neighbourhood. It was the custom of Pinetucky to take a half-holiday on Saturdays, and on one of these occasions Squire Inchly, instead of going to his shop or to the store, sat in his porch and smoked his pipe. After a while Miss Jane brought out her sewing and sat with him. Across the way Uncle Billy Carew sat in his easy-chair under the shade of a tree, and made queer gestures in the air with his hands and cane, while his son, a young man of twenty-five or thereabouts, paced moodily up and down the veranda. The birds fluttered in and out of the hedges of Cherokee rose that ran along both sides of the road, and over all the sun shone brightly. \"Billy is cuttin\u0027 up his antics ag\u0027in,\" said the Squire, finally. \"First the limbs give way, and then the mind. It\u0027s Providence, I reckon. We\u0027re all a-gittin\u0027 old.\" \"Why, you talk, Ichabod, as if Providence went around with a drink of dram in one hand and a stroke of palsy in t\u0027other one,\" said Miss Jane. \"It\u0027s the Old Boy that totes the dram. And don\u0027t you pester yourself on account of old Billy Oarew\u0027s palsy. A man\u0027s nimble enough in the legs when he can git to the dimmy- john.\" \"Well, I\u0027m sorry for Jack, Sister Jane,\" exclaimed the Squire, heartily. \"I am, from the bottom of my heart. The boy is too lonesome in his ways. He needs comp\u0027ny; he needs to be holp up, Sister Jane. He does, certain and shore.\" \"Well, we\u0027re all near-sighted; but when Im in trouble, I\u0027m like a hen a-layin\u0027; I don\u0027t want nobody to stand around and watch me. Not even them that feeds me. The Lord knows what he keeps old Billy Carew here to fret poor Jack for, but I don\u0027t,\" continued Miss Jane, with a sigh. \"I\u0027m much mistaken if that old creetur hain\u0027t got years before him to drink and dribble in.\" \"It passes me, Sister Jane,\" said Squire Inchly, moving uneasily in his chair. \"It passes me, certain and shore. Here was Billy, rich and healthy, Jack at college, and ever\u0027thing a-runnin\u0027 slick and smooth, when nothin\u0027 must do but the old creetur must take to the jug, and it\u0027s gone on and gone on, till old Bradley Gaither owns in-about all the Carew plantation that\u0027s wuth ownin\u0027. Maybe it was Billy\u0027s wife druv him to it, Sister Jane.\" \"I say the word!\" exclaimed Miss Jane, scornfully,—\"I say the word! How could a little bit of a dried-up \u0027oman drive a grown man to drink?\" \"They are a heap livelier than they look to be, Sister Jane,\" said the Squire reassuringly. \"Little as she was, I lay Billy Carew\u0027s wife had her say.\" \"Well,\" said Miss Jane, \"a mouse\u0027ll squeal if you tromple on it.\" Squire Inchly had a jovial appearance ordinarily; but when he found it necessary to wrestle with the moral problems that the sharp tongue of his sister presented to his mind, he was in the habit of putting on his spectacles, as if by that means to examine them more impartially. He put his spectacles on now, and with them a severe judicial frown. \"That\u0027s the trouble, Sister Jane,—that\u0027s the trouble,\" he said after a while. \"The mouse\u0027ll squeal and squeal, but where\u0027s the man that ever got use to sech squealin\u0027?\" \"Don\u0027t pester the mouse then,\" said Miss Jane, sententiously. \"Old Bradley Gaither,\" remarked the Squire, showing a disposition to wander away from a dangerous discussion,—\"Old Bradley Gaither ain\u0027t only got mighty nigh all the Carew plantation, but he\u0027s hot arter the balance of it. Last sale-day he took me off behind the Court-house, and, says he— \"\u0027Square,\u0027 says he, \u0027I\u0027d like mighty well for to git that Carew place,\u0027 says he. \"\u0027Why, Mr. Gaither,\u0027 says I, \u0027you\u0027ve in-about got it all now,\u0027 says I. \"\u0027Square Ichabod,\" says he, \u0027it\u0027s only a matter of two hundred acres or thereabouts, and it cuts right spang into my plantation,\u0027 says he. \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says I, \u0027two hundred acres ain\u0027t much, yit arter all it\u0027s a piece of land,\u0027 says I. \"\u0027That\u0027s so,\u0027 says he, \u0027but I want that land, and I\u0027m willin\u0027 for to pay reasonable. I want you to buy it for me, Square,\u0027 says he. \"Right across from where we sot,\" the Squire continued, taking off his spectacles, \"old Billy Carew was a cuttin\u0027 up and singin\u0027 his worldly-reminded gongs, and Jack was a-tryin\u0027 for to git him off home. \"\u0027Mr. Gaither,\u0027 says I, \u0027do you want to crowd that poor old creetur out \u0027n the county?\u0027 says I. \u0027And look at Jack; you won\u0027t find a better-favoured youngster,\u0027 says I. \"I disremember what he said,\" the Squire went on; \"but when I named Jack he puckered up them thin lips of his\u0027n like he was fortifyin\u0027 his mind ag\u0027in anger. I didn\u0027t let on about Rose and Jack, Sister Jane, but I reckon Mr. Gaither has got his suspicions. No doubt he has got his suspicions, Sister Jane.\" \"Ichabod,\" said Miss Jane, scratching her head with the long teeth of her tucking-comb, \"you\u0027re too old to be made a tool of. Let old Bradley Gaither do his own buyin\u0027 and sellin\u0027. That old scamp is deep as a well. Them that didn\u0027t know him\u0027d think he was sanctified; yit he\u0027s got devilment enough in him to break the winders out \u0027n the meetin\u0027-house. Well, he needn\u0027t pester wi\u0027 Jack and Rose,\" Miss Jane went on; \"Jack\u0027ll never marry Rose whilst old Billy Carew is hoppin\u0027 along betwixt the grocery and the graveyard. Lord, Lord! to think that sech a no- \u0027count old ereetur as that should be a-ha\u0027ntin\u0027 the face of the earth!\" \"He took to fiddlin\u0027 and drinkin\u0027 arter he was fifty year old,\" remarked the Squire. \"Yes, and the property he hain\u0027t drunk up he\u0027s fiddled away, till now he hain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 but a passel of half-free niggers and a little piece of land, and old Bradley Gaither is hungry for that. And that ain\u0027t all,\" exclaimed Miss Jane, solemnly; \"Jack is ruined, and Rose is distracted.\" \"Ah!\" said the Squire. \"Yes,\" said Miss Jane. \"Trouble is always double and thribble. Rose was here last Tuesday, and she sot by the winder there and watched Jack all the time she stayed. \"\u0027That\u0027s what I call courtship at long taw,\u0027 s\u0027 I. \"\u0027Yes, Miss Jane,\u0027 se\u0027 she, \u0027it is, and I\u0027m in a great deal of trouble about Jack. I understand him, but he don\u0027t understand me,\u0027 se\u0027 she. \u0027He\u0027s mad because father loaned his father money and then took land to pay for it. But I\u0027d marry Jack,\u0027 se\u0027 she, \u0027if only to give him his land back.\u0027 \"I declare!\" Miss Jane continued, \"\u0027twould \u0027a\u0027 melted airy heart in the universe to see that child blushin\u0027 and cryin\u0027, I went and stood by her and put my arms round her, and I says to her, s\u0027 I— \"\u0027Don\u0027t you fret, honey, don\u0027t you fret. Old Billy Carew is full of capers and vain babblin\u0027s,\u0027 s\u0027 I, \u0027and your pappy is puffed up by his fleshly mind; but the Almighty, he\u0027s a-watching\u0027 \u0027em. He\u0027ll fetch \u0027em up wi\u0027 a round turn,\u0027 s\u0027 I; \u0027He knows how to deal wi\u0027 unreasonable and wicked men.\u0027 I said them very words.\" \"Saint Paul said \u0027em before you, Sister Jane, but you said \u0027em right,—you said \u0027em right,\" exclaimed Squire Inchly, heartily. \"Well, I don\u0027t set up to judge nobody, but I don\u0027t need no spyglass to see what\u0027s right in front of my face,\" said Miss Jane. Thus these two old people sat and talked about the affairs of their friends and neighbours,—affairs in which they might be said to have almost a personal interest. The conversation turned to other matters; but across the way they saw enacted some of the preliminaries and accompaniments of a mysterious complication that finally became as distressing and as disastrous as a tragedy. Old Billy Carew continued to gesticulate with his cane and to talk to himself. He desired no other audience. One moment he would be convulsed with laughter; then he would draw himself up proudly, wave his hand imperiously, and seem to be laying down a proposition that demanded great deliberation of thought and accuracy of expression. After a while his son, apparently growing tired of the humiliating spectacle, left his father to himself, and went over to Squire Inchly\u0027s. Jack Carew was a great favourite with the Squire and his sister. Miss Jane had petted him as a boy; indeed, after the death of his own mother, she had maintained towards him the relations of a foster-mother. His instinct had told him, even when a child, that the asperity of Miss Inehly was merely the humorous mask of a gentle and sensitive heart. As he flung himself wearily in the chair which Miss Jane had been quick to provide, he seemed, notwithstanding his dejection, to be a very handsome specimen of manhood. His hair was dark, his eyes large and lustrous, his nose straight and firm, and his chin square and energetic. His face was smooth-shaven, and but for the glow of health in his cheeks, his complexion would have been sallow. \"Father has gone to the legislature again,\" he said with a faint apologetic smile and a motion of the hand toward the scene of the poor old man\u0027s alcoholic eloquence. \"Well,\" said Miss Jane, soothingly, \"he hain\u0027t the first poor creetur that\u0027s flung his welfare to the winds. The Old Boy\u0027s mighty busy in these days, but the Almighty hain\u0027t dead yit, I reckon, and he\u0027ll come along thereckly and set things to rights.\" The young man\u0027s face grew gloomy as he looked across the way at his homestead. The house was showing signs of neglect, and the fences were falling away here and there, The jagged splinters of a tall oak, whose top had been wrenched off by a storm, were outlined against the sky, and an old man babbled and dribbled near by. On the hither side the Cherokee roses bloomed and the birds sang. It seemed as if some horrible nightmare had thrust itself between Jack Carew and the sweet dreams of his youth. \"I trust you are right, Miss Jane,\" said Jack, after a long pause; \"but He will have to come soon if lie sets my affairs to rights.\" \"Don\u0027t git down-hearted, Jack,\" exclaimed Miss Jane, laying her hand upon the young man\u0027s arm with a motherly touch. \"Them that\u0027s big-hearted and broad- shouldered hain\u0027t got much to be afear\u0027d of in this world. Have you forgot Rose Gaither, Jack?\" \"I haven\u0027t forgotten Bradley Gaither,\" said Jack, frowning darkly, \"and I won\u0027t forget him in a day, you may depend. Bradley Gaither is at the bottom of all the misery you see there.\" The young man made a gesture that included the whole horizon. \"Ah, Jack!\" exclaimed Miss Jane, solemnly, \"I won\u0027t deny but what old Bradley Gaither is been mighty busy runnin\u0027 arter the rudiments of the world, but the time was when you\u0027d kindle up barely at the mention of Rose Gaither\u0027s name.\" \"Shall I tell you the truth, Miss Jane?\" asked Jack Carew, turning to Miss Inchly with a frank but bashful smile. \"You\u0027ve never failed to do that, Jack, when the pinch come.\" \"Well, this is the pinch, then. But for Rose Gaither I should have sold out here when I first found how matters stood. I could easily sell out now—to Bradley Gaither.\" \"That\u0027s so, Jack, you could,\" said Squire Inchly, who had been a sympathetic listener. \"Yes, sir, you could; there ain\u0027t no two ways about that.\" \"But I wouldn\u0027t, and I won\u0027t,\" continued Jack. \"Everybody around here knows my troubles, and I propose, to stay here. I haven\u0027t forgotten Rose Gaither, Miss Jane, but I\u0027m afraid she has forgotten me. She has changed greatly.\" \"You look in the glass,\" said Miss Jane, with a knowing toss of the head, \"and you\u0027ll see where the change is. Rose was here t\u0027other day, and she stood right in that room there, behind them identical curtains. I wish—but I sha\u0027n\u0027t tell the poor child\u0027s secrets. I\u0027ll say this: the next time you see Rose Gaither a-passin\u0027 by, you raise your hat and tell her howdy, and you\u0027ll git the sweetest smile that ever man got.\" \"Miss Jane!\" exclaimed Jack Carew, \"you are the best woman in the world.\" \"Except one, I reckon,\" said Miss Jane, dryly. Jack Carew rose from his chair, and straightened himself to his full height. He was a new man. Youth and hope rekindled their fires in his eyes. The flush of enthusiasm revisited his face. \"I feel like a new man; I am a new man!\" he exclaimed. Then he glanced at the pitiful figure, maundering and sputtering across the way. \"I am going home,\" he went on, \"and will put father to bed and nurse him and take care of him just as if—well, just as if I was his mother.\" \"The Lord\u0027ll love you for it, Jack,\" said Miss Jane, \"and so\u0027ll Rose Gaither. When ever\u0027thing else happens,\" she continued, solemnly, \"put your trust in the Lord, and don\u0027t have no misdoubts of Rose.\" The superstition that recognises omens and portents we are apt to laugh at as vulgar, but it has an enduring basis in the fact that no circumstance can be regarded as absolutely trivial. Events apparently the most trifling lead\u0027 to the most tremendous results. The wisest of us know not by what process the casual is transformed into the dreadful, nor how accident is twisted into fate. Jack Carew visited the Inchlys almost daily; yet if he had postponed the visit, the purport of which has been given above, the probability is that he would have been spared much suffering; on the other hand, he would have missed much happiness that came to him at a time of life when he was best prepared to appreciate it. He had determined in his own mind to sell the little land and the few negroes he had saved from the wreck his father\u0027s extravagance had made; he had determined to sell these, and slip away with his father to a new life in the West; but his conversation with Miss Jane gave him new hope and courage, so that when Bradley Gaither, a few weeks afterwards, offered to buy the Carew place for two or three times its value, he received a curt and contemptuous message of refusal. Young Carew was high-strung and sensitive, even as a boy, and events had only served to develop these traits. When he was compelled to leave college to take charge of his father\u0027s\u0027 affairs, he felt that his name was disgraced for ever. He found, however, that all who had known him were anxious to hold up his hands, and to give him such support as one friend is prepared to give another. If the Pinetuckians were simple-minded, they were also sympathetic, There was something gracious as well as wholesome in their attitude. The men somehow succeeded in impressing him with a vague idea that they had passed through just such troubles in their youth. The idea was encouraging, and Jack Carew made the most of it. But he never thought of Rose Gaither without a sense of deepest humiliation. He had loved Rose when they were schoolchildren together, but his passion had now reached such proportions that he deeply resented the fact that his school-hoy love had been so careless and shallow a feeling. Now that circumstances had placed her beyond his reach, he regretted that his youthful love experience was not worthier of the place it held in his remembrance. He could forget that Rose Gaither was the daughter of the man to whom he attributed his troubles, but he could never forget that he himself was the son of a man whose weakness had found him out at an age when manhood ought to have made him strong. Still, Jack Carew made the most of a bad situation. He had the courage, the endurance, and the hopefulness of youth. He faced his perplexities with at least the appearance of good-humour; and if he had his moments of despair, when the skeleton in the jug in the closet paraded in public, Pinetucky never suspected it. The truth is, while Pinetucky was sympathetic and neighbourly, it was not inclined to make a great fuss over those who took a dram too much now and then. Intemperance was an evil, to be sure; but even intemperance had its humorous side in those days, and Pinetucky was apt to look at the humorous side. One fine morning, however, Pinetuoky awoke to the fact that it was the centre and scene of a decided sensation. Rumour pulled on her bonnet and boots, and went gadding about like mad. Pinetucky was astonished, then perplexed, then distressed, and finally indignant, as became a conservative and moral community. A little after sunrise, Bradley Gaither had galloped up to Squire Inchly\u0027s door with the information that two bales of cotton had been stolen from hie place the night before. The facts, as sot forth by Bradley Gaither, were that he had twelve bales of cotton ready for market. The twelve balei had been loaded upon three, wagons, and the wagons were to start for Augusta at daybreak. At the last moment, when everything was ready, the teams harnessed, and the drivers in their seats, it was discovered that two bales of the cotton were missing. Fortunately, it had rained during the night, and Bradley Gaither had waited until it was light enough to make an investigation. He found that a wagon bad been driven to his packing-screw. He saw, moreover, that but one wagon had passed along the road after the rain, and it was an easy matter to follow the tracks. The fact of the theft had surprised Squire Inchly, but the details created consternation in his mind. The tracks of the wagon led to the Carew place! Squire Inchly was prompt with a rebuke. \"Why, you\u0027ve woke up wi\u0027 a joke in your mouth, Mr. Gaither. Now that you\u0027ve spit it out, less start fresh. A spiteful joke before breakfus\u0027 \u0027ll make your flesh crawl arter supper, Mr. Gaither.\" Squire Inchly spoke seriously, as became a magistrate. Bradley Gaither\u0027s thin lips grew thinner as he smiled. \"I\u0027m as serious as the thieves that stole my cotton, Squire Inchly,\" said Bradley Gaither. \"Two whole bales of cotton in these days is a heavy loss,\" said the Squire, reflectively. \"I hope you\u0027ll ketch the inconsiderate parties to the larceny.\" \"If you will go with me, Squire, we\u0027ll call by for Brother Gossett and Colonel Hightower, and if I\u0027m not mistaken we\u0027ll find the cotton not far from here.\" \"Well, sir,\" said the Squire, indignantly, \"you won\u0027t find it on the Carew place. I\u0027ll go wi\u0027 you and welcome. We don\u0027t need no search warrant.\" The long and the short of it was that the cotton was found concealed in Jack Carew\u0027s rickety barn under a pile of fodder. Of those who joined Bradley Gaither in the search, not one believed that the cottor would be found on the Carew place; and some of them had even gone so far as to suggest to Mr. Gaither that his suspicions had been fathered by his prejudices; but that injured individual merely smiled his cold little smile, and declared that there could be no harm in following the wagon tracks. This was reasonable enough; and the result was that not only was the cotton found, but the wagon standing under the shelter, and two mules at the trough in the lot showed signs of having been used. These things so shocked those who had gone with Bradley Gaither that they had little to say. They stood confounded. They could not successfully dispute the evidence of their eyes. They were simple-minded men, and therefore sympathetic. Each one felt ashamed. They did not look into each other\u0027s eyes and give utterance to expressions of astonishment. They said nothing; but each one, with the exception of Bradley Gaither, fell into a state of mental confusion akin to awe. When Bradley Gaither, with cm. air of triumph, asked them if they were satisfied, they said nothing, but turned and walked away one after the other. They turned and walked away, and went to their homes; and somehow after that, though the sun shone as brightly and the birds fluttered and sang as joyously, a silence fell upon Pinetucky,—a silence full of austerity. The men talked in subdued tones when they met, as though they expected justice to discharge one of her thunderbolts at their feet; and the women went about their duties with a degree of nervousness that was aptly described by Miss Jane Inchly long afterwards, when reciting the experiences of that most memorable day in the history of Pinetucky. \"I let a sifter drop out \u0027n my hand,\" said she, \"and I declare to gracious if it didn\u0027t sound like a cannon had went off.\" In all that neighbourhood the Carews, father and son, had but one accuser, and not one apologist. Pinetucky existed in a primitive period, as we are in the habit of believing now, and its people were simple- minded people. In this age of progress and culture, morality and justice are arrayed in many refinements of speech and thought. They have been readjusted, so to speak, by science; but in Pinetucky in the forties, morality and justice were as robust and as severe as they are in the Bible. It was not until after the machinery of justice had been set in motion that Pinetucky allowed itself to comment on the case; but the comment was justified by the peculiar conduct of the Carews, When they were confronted with the facts—the cotton concealed in the barn and the warrant in the hands of the sheriff,—old Billy Carew fell to trembling as though he had the palsy. Jack had turned pale as death, and had made a movement toward Bradley Gaither as though to offer violence; but when he saw his father shaking so, the colour returned to his face, and he exclaimed quickly— \"The warrant is for me alone, Mr. Sheriff. Pay no attention to father. He is old, and his mind is weak.\" \"He\u0027s a liar!\" the old man screamed, when he found his voice. \"He\u0027s a miserable liar! He never stole that cotton. Don\u0027t tetch him! don\u0027t you dast to tetch him! He\u0027ll lie to you, but he won\u0027t steal your cotton! Put my name in that warrant. Bradley Gaither stole my money and land; I reckon I\u0027ve got the rights to steal his cotton.\" \"He\u0027s drunk again,\" said Jack. \"We\u0027ll carry him in the house, and then I\u0027ll be ready to go with you.\" But the old man was not carried to the house without a scene. He raved, and screamed, and swore, and finally fell to the ground in a fit of impotent rage, protesting to the last that Jack was a liar. When those who were present had been worked up to the highest pitch of excitement, Bradley Gaither spoke— \"Don\u0027t criminate yourself, Jack. I am willing to drop this matter.\" He appeared to be greatly agitated. \"drop what matter?\" exclaimed young Carew in a passion. \"I have a matter with you, sir, that won\u0027t be dropped.\" \"Go your ways, then,\" said Bradley Gaither; \"I\u0027ve done my duty.\" With that he mounted his horse, and Jack Carew was left in the hands of the sheriff. The machinery of the law was not as difficult to set in motion in those days as it is now. There was no delay. Pinetuoky was greatly interested in the trial, and during the two days of its continuance delegations of Pinetuckians were present as spectators. Some of these were summoned to testify to the good character of young Carew, and this they did with a simplicity that was impressive; but neither their testimony nor the efforts of the distinguished counsel for the defence, Colonel Peyton Poindexter, had any effect. The facts and the tacit admissions of Jack were against him. Colonel Poindexter\u0027s closing speech was long remembered, and indeed is alluded to even now, as the most eloquent and impressive ever delivered in the court-house in Rockville; but it failed to convince the jury. A verdict in accordance with the facts and testimony was brought in, and Jack Carew was sentenced to serve a term in the penitentiary at Milledgeville. The first to bring this information to Pinetucky was Bradley Gaither himself. He stopped at Squire Inehly\u0027s for his daughter, and went in. \"What\u0027s the news?\" asked Miss Jane. \"Bad, very bad news,\" said Bradley Gaither. \"Jack ain\u0027t hung, I reckon,\" said Miss Jane. \"My mind tells me, day and night, that the poor boy in innocent as the child that\u0027s unborn.\" \"Innocent or guilty,\" said Bradley Gaither, \"he has been sent to the penitentiary.\" Miss Jane gave a quick glance at Rose, and was just in time to catch her as she fell from her chair. \"Ah, poor child!\" cried Miss Jane, \"her heart is broke!\" \"Rose!—Daughter!—Darling!\" exclaimed Bradley Gaither, dropping on his knees beside her. \"Oh, what is this? What have I done? Speak to her, Miss Inchly! What shall I do?\" He was pale as death, and his features worked convulsively. \"Do nothin\u0027, Mr. Gaither. You\u0027ve done more \u0027n you can undo a\u0027ready. You\u0027ve took and give that poor boy over for to be persecuted, Mr. Gaither, and now the innocent suffers and the wicked goes scotch-free.\" Bradley Gaither covered his face with his hands and groaned aloud. \"What have I done? What have I done?\" he cried. Miss Jane supported the girl in her strong arms with a grim display of affection, but her attitude towards Bradley Gaither was uncompromising. \"Don\u0027t alarm yourself, Mr. Gaither,\" she said; \"this poor child\u0027ll come too, quick enough. Folks don\u0027t fling off the\u0027r misery this easy!\" Rose revived after a while, but she seemed to have no desire to talk to her father. After a copious use of camphor, Miss Jane fixed Rose comfortably on the lounge, and the girl lay there and gazed at the ceiling, the picture of wide-eyed despair. Bradley Gaither paced the room like one distracted. His sighs were heart-rending. When Miss Jane succeeded in getting him out of the room, he paced up and down the entry, moving his lips and groaning as though in great mental agony. Failing to understand what emotions he was at the mercy of, Miss Jane failed to sympathise with him. To her mind his display of grief bore no sort of proportion to the cause, and she had a woman\u0027s contempt for any manifestation of weakness in man, even the weakness of grief. \"I\u0027ll pray to the Lord to forgive me!\" he cried out piteously. \"That\u0027s right,\" exclaimed Miss Jane, in her decisive way. \"But if the grace of pra\u0027r was in the hinges of the knee, I know a heap of folks that\u0027d be easy in the mind.\" Every word she spoke cut like a knife, but not until long after did Miss Inchly realise the fact. When she did realise it, it is to be feared she hugged the remembrance of it to her bosom with a sort of grim thankfulness that Providence had so happily fashioned her words and directed her tongue. As time passed on, the Pinetuckians became aware that a great change had come over both Bradley Gaither and his daughter. The father grew old before his time, and fell into a decline, as his neighbours expressed it. The daughter grew more beautiful, but it was beauty of a kind that belonged to devoutness; so that in contemplating it the minds of men were led in the direction of mercy and charity and all manner of good deeds. One night, a year or more after the trial and sentence of Jack Carew, a negro on horseback rode to Squire Inchly\u0027s door, and said that his master, Bradley Gaither, desired the Squire to come to him at once. The worthy magistrate was prompt to obey the summons; and when he arrived at the Gaither place, he found that the preacher and other neighbours had also been summoned. Bradley Gaither lay upon his bed, surrounded by these, and it was plain to see that his sands of life had about run out. He presented a spectacle of dissolution calculated to arouse the sympathies of those who stood around his bed. When Squire Inchly had arrived, Bradley Gaither lay a little while with his eyes closed as in a dream. Then he motioned to his daughter, who drew from beneath his pillow a few sheets of letter-paper stained and blotted with ink. This she handed to the minister. \"Read it aloud,\" said Bradley Gaither. The minister, with some degree of embarrassment, adjusted his spectacles and read:— \"With this paper will be found my last will and testament. I am unhappy, but I should be less miserable if I knew I could put such meaning in these lines as no man could misunderstand. I have sinned against an innocent man, I have sinned against my dear daughter, I have sinned against myself, I have sinned against God. I have been guilty of a great wrong, and though I cannot forgive myself, yet I hope to be forgiven. John Carew, who is now in prison, is an innocent man. I coveted his land. In my worldly-mindedness I set my heart upon his possessions. I offered him double their value. I thought he treated me with contempt, and then I hit upon a plan to drive him out. I carried the cotton to his barn and hid it. He knew no more about it than any honest man. But as God is my judge, I did not foresee the end. I thought he would compromise and sell the land and go away. At the last the law took the matter out of my hands. John Carew believes that he is suffering punishment in place of his father; but William Carew is as honest as his son, and no man could be honester than that. I, Bradley Gaither, being in my right mind and of sound memory, do hereby charge myself with the crime for which John Carew has been adjudged guilty. Let the disgrace of it be attached to me alone. The sin of it I hope a merciful God will forgive.\" This document was duly signed and witnessed. When the preacher reached the end, he said, \"Let us pray;\" and while that prayer, as fervent as simplicity could make it, was ascending heavenward, the soul of Bradley Gaither took its flight. \"I glanced at him arter the breath left him,\" said Squire Inchly, relating the facts to his sister, \"and he looked like a man that had shook hisself free from a heap of worriment. I hope he\u0027s at peace. I do, from the bottom of my heart.\" The confession was received with great wonder in Pinetucky; but there was not one among the Pinetuckians who did not believe that Bradley Gaither was a better man at bottom than his life had shown him to be, not one, indeed, who did not believe that his grievous errors were among the dispensations which an all- wise Providence employs to chasten the proud and humble the vainglorious. When Jack Carew returned to his friends, he made his way straight to Squire Inchly\u0027s. He was not much changed, but the sight of him gave Miss Jane the cue for tears. These, however, she dried immediately, and, with a smile that Jack remembered long, motioned towards the little sitting-room. \"Go in there, Jack. A man oughtn\u0027t to grumble at waitin\u0027 for his dinner, if he knows he\u0027ll git pie.\" In the little sitting-room Rose Gaither was waiting for him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2807/77579.html","bookId":506,"book":{"id":506,"title":"Mingo And Other Sketches in Black and White","description":"简介： IN 1876, circumstances, partly accidental and partly sentimental, led me to revisit Crooked Creek Church, near the little village of Rockville, in Middle Georgia.
