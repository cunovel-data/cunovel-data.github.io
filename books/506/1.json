{"id":21684,"no":1,"title":"MINGO: A SKETCH OF LIFE IN MIDDLE GEORGIA.","content":"I. IN 1876, circumstances, partly accidental and partly sentimental, led me to revisit Crooked Creek Church, near the little village of Rockville, in Middle Georgia. I was amazed at the changes which a few brief years had wrought. The ancient oaks ranged roundabout remained the same, but upon everything else time had laid its hand right heavily. Even the building seemed to have shrunk: the pulpit was less massive and imposing, the darkness beyond the rafters less mysterious. The preacher had grown grey, and feebleness had taken the place of that physical vigour which was the distinguishing feature of his interpretations of the larger problems of theology. People I had never seen sat in the places of those I had known so well. There were only traces here and there of the old congregation, whose austere simplicity had made so deep an impression upon my youthful mind The blooming girls of 1860 had grown into careworn matrons, and the young men had developed in their features the strenuous uncertainty and misery of the period of desolation and disaster through which they had passed. Anxiety had so ground itself into their lives that a stranger to the manner might well have been pardoned for giving a sinister interpretation to these pitiable manifestations of hopelessness and unsuccess. I had known the venerable preacher intimately in the past; but his eyes, wandering vaguely over the congregation, and resting curiously upon me, betrayed no recognition. Age, which had whitened his hair and enfeebled his voice, seemed also to have given him the privilege of ignoring everything but the grave and the mysteries beyond. These swift processes of change and decay were calculated to make a profound impression, but my attention was called away from all such reflections. Upon a bench near the pulpit, in the section reserved for the coloured members, sat an old negro man whose face was perfectly familiar. I had known him in my boyhood as Mingo, the carriage-driver and body-servant of Judge Junius Wornum. He had changed but little. His head was whiter than when I saw him last, but his attitude was as firm and as erect, and the evidences of his wonderful physical strength as apparent, as ever. He sat with his right hand to his chin, his strong serious face turned contemplatively toward the rafters. When his eye chanced to meet mine, a smile of recognition lit up his features, his head and body drooped forward, and his hand fell away from his face, completing a salutation at once graceful, picturesque, and imposing. I have said that few evidences of change manifested themselves in Mingo; and so it seemed at first, but a closer inspection showed one remarkable change. I had known him when his chief purpose in life seemed to be to enjoy himself. He was a slave, to be sure, but his condition was no restraint upon his spirits. He was known far and wide as \"Laughing Mingo,\" and upon hundreds of occasions he was the boon companion of the young men about Rockville in their wild escapades. Many who read this will remember the \"\u0027possum suppers\" which it was Mingo\u0027s delight to prepare for these young men, and he counted among his friends and patrons many who afterward became distinguished both in war and in the civil professions. At these gatherings, Mingo, bustling around and serving his guests, would keep the table in a roar with his quaint sayings, and his local satires in the shape of impromptu doggerel; and he would also repeat snatches of orations which he had heard in Washington when Judge Wornum was a member of Congress. But his chief accomplishments lay in the wonderful ease and fluency with which he imitated the eloquent appeals of certain ambitious members of the Kockville bar, and in his travesties of the bombastic flights of the stump-speakers of that day. It appeared, however, as he sat in the church, gazing thoughtfully and earnestly at the preacher, that the old-time spirit of fun and humour had been utterly washed out of his face. There was no sign of grief, no mark of distress, but he had the air of settled anxiety belonging to those who are tortured by an overpowering responsibility. Apparently here was an interesting study. If the responsibilities of life are problems to those who have been trained to solve them, how much more formidable must they be to this poor negro but lately lifted to his feet! Thus my reflections took note of the pathetic associations and suggestions clustering around this dignified representative of an unfortunate race. Upon this particular occasion church services were to extend into the afternoon, and there was an interval of rest after the morning sermon, covering the hour of noon. This interval was devoted by both old and young to the discussion of matters seriously practical. The members of the congregation had brought their dinner baskets, and the contents thereof were spread around under the trees in true pastoral style. Those who came unprovided were, in pursuance of an immemorial custom of the section and the occasion, taken in charge by the simple and hearty hospitality of the members. Somehow I was interested in watching Mingo. As he passed from the church with the congregation, and moved slowly along under the trees, he presented quite a contrast to the other negroes who were present. These, with the results of their rural surroundings superadded to the natural shyness of their race, hung upon the outskirts of the assembly, as though their presence was merely casual, while Mingo passed along from group to group of his white friends and acquaintances with that familiar and confident air of meritorious humility and unpretentious dignity which is associated with good-breeding and gentility the world over. When he lifted his hat in salutation, there was no servility in the gesture; when he bent his head, and dropped his eyes upon the ground, his dignity was strengthened and fortified rather than compromised. Both his manners and his dress retained the flavour of a social system the exceptional features of which were too often by both friend and foe made to stand for the system itself. His tall beaver, with its curled brim, and his blue broadcloth dress-coat, faded and frayed, with its brass buttons, bore unmistakable evidence of their age and origin, but they seemed to be a reasonable and necessary contribution to his individuality. Passing slowly through the crowd, Mingo made his way to a double-seated buggy shielded from all contingencies of sun and rain by an immense umbrella. Prom beneath the seat he drew forth a large hamper, and proceeded to arrange its contents upon a wide bench which stood near. While this was going on I observed a tall angular woman, accompanied by a bright-looking little girl, making her way toward Mingo\u0027s buggy. The woman was plainly, oven shabbily, dressed, so that the gay ribbons and flowers worn by the child were gaudy by contrast. The woman pressed forward with decision, her movements betraying a total absence of that undulatory grace characteristic of the gentler sex, while the little girl dancing about her showed not only the grace and beauty of youth, but a certain refinement of pose and gesture calculated to attract attention. Mingo made way for these with ready deference, and after a little I saw him coming toward me. He came forward, shook hands, and remarked that he had brought me an invitation to dine with Mrs. Feratia Bivins. \"Miss F\u0027raishy \u0027members you, boss,\" he said, bowing and smiling, \"en she up\u0027n say she be mighty glad er yo\u0027 comp\u0027ny ef you kin put up wid cole vittles an\u0027 po\u0027 far\u0027; en ef you come,\" he added on his own account, \"we like it mighty well.\" II. ACCEPTING the invitation, I presently found myself dining with Mrs. Bivins, and listening to her remarkable flow of small-talk, while Mingo hovered around, the embodiment of active hospitality. \"Mingo \u0027lowed he\u0027d ast you up,\" said Mrs. Bivins, \"an\u0027 I says, says I, \u0027Don\u0027t you be a-pesterin\u0027 the gentulmun, when you know thar\u0027s plenty er the new-issue quality ready an\u0027 a-waitin\u0027 to pull an\u0027 haul at \u0027im,\u0027 says I. Not that I begrudge the vittles—not by no means; I hope I hain\u0027t got to that yit. But somehow er \u0027nother folks what hain\u0027t got no great shakes to brag \u0027bout gener\u0027ly feels sorter skittish when strange folks draps in on \u0027em. Goodness knows I hain\u0027t come to that pass wher\u0027 I begrudges the vittles that folks eats, bekaze anybody betweenst this an\u0027 Clinton, Jones County, Georgy, \u0027ll tell you the Sanderses wa\u0027n\u0027t the set to stint the\u0027r stomachs. I was a Sanders \u0027fore I married, an\u0027 when I come \u0027way frum pa\u0027s house hit was thes like turnin\u0027 my back on a barbecue. Not by no means was I begrudgin\u0027 of the vittles. Says I, \u0027Mingo,\u0027 says I, \u0027ef the gentulmun is a teetotal stranger, an\u0027 nobody else hain\u0027t got the common perliteness to ast \u0027im, shorely you mus\u0027 ast \u0027im,\u0027 says I; \u0027but don\u0027t go an\u0027 make no great to-do,\u0027 says I; \u0027bekaze the little we got mightent be satisfactual to the gentulmun,\u0027 says I. What we got may be little enough, an\u0027 it may be too much, but hit\u0027s welcome.\" It would be impossible to convey an idea of the emphasis which Mrs. Bivins imposed upon her conversation. She talked rapidly, but with a certain deliberation of manner which gave a quaint interest to everything she said. She had thin grey hair, a prominent nose, firm thin lips, and eyes that gave a keen and sparkling individuality to sharp and homely features. She had evidently seen sorrow and defied it. There was no suggestion of compromise in manner or expression. Even her hospitality was uncompromising. I endeavoured to murmur my thanks to Mrs. Bivins for Mingo\u0027s thoughtfulness, but her persistent conversation drowned out such poor phrases as I could hastily frame. \"Come \u0027ere, Pud Hon,\" continued Mrs. Bivins, calling the child, and trimming the demonstrative terms of \"Pudding\" and \"Honey\" to suit all exigencies of affection—\"come \u0027ere, Pud Hon, an\u0027 tell the gentulmun howdy. Gracious me! don\u0027t be so countrified. He ain\u0027t a-gwine to bite you. No, sir, you won\u0027t fine no begrudgers mixed up with the Sanderses. Hit useter be a common sayin\u0027 in Jones, an\u0027 cle\u0027r \u0027cross into Jasper, that pa would \u0027a bin a rich man an\u0027 \u0027a owned niggers if it hadn\u0027t but \u0027a bin bekase he sot his head agin stintin\u0027 of his stomach. That\u0027s what they useter say—usen\u0027t they, Mingo?\" \"Dat w\u0027at I year tell, Miss F\u0027raishy—sho\u0027,\" Mingo assented, with great heartiness. But Mrs. Bivins\u0027s volubility would hardly wait for this perfunctory indorsement. She talked as she arranged the dishes, and occasionally she would hold a piece of crockery suspended in the air as she emphasised her words. She dropped into a mortuary strain—\"Poor pa! I don\u0027t never have nuthin\u0027 extry an\u0027 I don\u0027t never see a dish er fried chicken but what pa pops in my mind. A better man hain\u0027t never draw\u0027d the breath of life—that they hain\u0027t. An\u0027 he was thes as gayly as a kitten. When we gals\u0027d have comp\u0027ny to dinner, pore pa he\u0027d cut his eye at me, an\u0027 up an\u0027 say, says he, \u0027Gals, this \u0027ere turkey\u0027s mighty nice, yit I\u0027m reely afeared you put too much inguns in the stuffin. Maybe the young men don\u0027t like \u0027em as good as you all does;\u0027 an\u0027 then pore pa\u0027d drap his knife an\u0027 fork, an\u0027 laugh tell the tears come in his eyes. Sister Prue she useter run off an\u0027 have a cry, but I was one er the kind what wa\u0027n\u0027t easy sot back. \"I\u0027d \u0027a bin mighty glad if Pud yer had er took airter pa\u0027s famerly, but frum the tip eend er her toe nails to the toppermust ha\u0027r of her head she\u0027s a Wornum. Hit ain\u0027t on\u0027y thes a streak yer an\u0027 a stripe thar—hit\u0027s the whole bolt. I reckon maybe you know\u0027d ole Jedge June Wornum; well, Jedge June he was Pud\u0027s gran\u0027pa, an\u0027 Deely Wornum was her ma. Maybe you might \u0027a seed Deely when she was a school-gal.\" Cordelia Wornum! No doubt my astonishment made itself apparent, for Mrs. Bivins bridled up promptly, and there was a clearly perceptible note of defiance in her tone as she proceeded. \"Yes, sir-ree! An\u0027 make no mistake! Deely Wornum married my son, an\u0027 Henry Clay Bivina made \u0027er a good husbun\u0027, if I do have to give it out myse\u0027f. Yes, \u0027ndeed! An\u0027 yit if you\u0027d \u0027a heern the rippit them Wornums kicked up, you\u0027d \u0027a thought the pore chile\u0027d done took\u0027n run off \u0027long of a whole passel er high pirates frum somewheres er \u0027nother. In about that time the ole Jedge he got sorter fibbled up, some say in his feet, an\u0027 some say in his head; but his wife, that Em\u0027ly Wornum, she taken on awful. I never seen her a-gwine on myse\u0027f; not that they was any hidin\u0027 out \u0027mongst the Bivinses er the Sanderses—bless you, no! bekaze here\u0027s what wa\u0027n\u0027t afeared er all the Wornums in the continental State er Georgy, not if they\u0027d \u0027a mustered out under the lead er ole Nick hisse\u0027f, which I have my doubta if he wa\u0027n\u0027t somewheres aroun\u0027. I never seen \u0027er, but I heern tell er how she was a-cuttin\u0027 up. You mayn\u0027t think it, but that \u0027oman taken it on herse\u0027f to call up all the niggers on the place an\u0027 give \u0027em her forbiddance to go an\u0027 see the\u0027r young mistiss.\" \"Yit I lay dey tuck \u0027n sneak \u0027roun\u0027 en come anyhow, ain\u0027t dey, Miss F\u0027raishy?\" inquired Mingo, rubbing his hands together and smiling blandly. \"That they did—that they did!\" was Mrs. Bivins\u0027s emphatic response. \"Niggers is niggers, but them Wornum niggers was a cut er two \u0027bove the common run. I\u0027ll say that, an\u0027 I\u0027ll say it on the witness stan\u0027. Freedom might a turned the\u0027r heads when it come to t\u0027other folks, but hit didn\u0027t never turn the\u0027r heads \u0027bout the\u0027r young mistiss. An\u0027 if Mingo here hain\u0027t done his juty \u0027cordin\u0027 to his lights, then I dunner what juty is. I\u0027ll say that open an\u0027 above-board, high an\u0027 low.\" The curious air of condescension which Mrs. Bivins assumed as she said this, the tone of apology which she employed in paying this tribute to Mingo and the Wornum negroes, formed a remarkable study. Evidently she desired me distinctly to understand that in applauding these worthy coloured people she was in no wise compromising her own dignity. Thus Mrs. Bivins rattled away, pausing only long enough now and then to deplore my lack of appetite. Meanwhile Mingo officiated around the improvised board with gentle affability; and the little girl, bearing strong traces of her lineage in her features—a resemblance which was confirmed by a pretty little petulance of temper—made it convenient now and again to convey a number of tea cakes into Mingo\u0027s hat, which happened to be sitting near, the conveyance taking place in spite of laughable pantomimic protests on the part of the old man, ranging from appealing nods and grimaces to indignant frowns and gestures. \"When Deely died,\" Mrs. Bivins went on, waving a towel over a tempting jar of preserves, \"they wa\u0027n\u0027t nobody but what was afeared to break it to Emily Wornum, an\u0027 the pore chile\u0027d done been buried too long to talk about before her ma heern tell of it, an\u0027 then she drapped like a clap er thunder had hit \u0027er. Airter so long a time, Mingo thar he taken it \u0027pun hisse\u0027f to tell \u0027er, an\u0027 she flopped right down in \u0027er tracks, an\u0027 Mingo he holp \u0027er into the house, an\u0027, bless your life, when he come to he\u0027p \u0027er out\u0027n it, she was a changed \u0027oman. \u0027Twa\u0027n\u0027t long \u0027fore she taken a notion to come to my house, an\u0027 one mornin\u0027 when I was a-washin\u0027 up dishes, I heern some un holler at the gate, an\u0027 thar sot Mingo peerched up on the Wornum carry-all, an\u0027 of all livin\u0027 flesh, who should be in thar but ole Emily Wornum! \"Hit\u0027s a sin to say it,\" continued Mrs. Bivins, smiling a dubious little smile that was not without its serious suggestions, \"but I tightened up my apern strings, an\u0027 flung my glance aroun\u0027 tell hit drapped on the battlin\u0027-stick, bekaze I flared up the minnit I seen \u0027er, an\u0027 I says to myse\u0027f, says I: \u0027If hit\u0027s a fracas youer huntin\u0027, my lady, I lay you won\u0027t hafter put on your specs to fine it.\u0027 An\u0027 then I says to Pud, says I— \"\u0027Pud Hon, go in the shed-room thar, chile, an\u0027 if you hear anybody a-hollerin\u0027 an\u0027 a-squallin\u0027, thes shet your eyeleds an\u0027 grit your teeth, bekaze hit\u0027ll be your pore ole granny a-tryin\u0027 to git even with some er your kin.\u0027 \"An\u0027 then I taken a cheer an\u0027 sot down by the winder. D\u0027reckly in come Emily Wornum, an\u0027 I wish I may die if I\u0027d \u0027a know\u0027d \u0027er if I\u0027d saw \u0027er anywheres else on the face er the yeth. She had this \u0027ere kinder dazzled look what wimmen has airter they bin baptized in the water. I helt my head high, but I kep\u0027 my eye on the battlin\u0027-stick, an\u0027 if she\u0027d \u0027a made fight, I\u0027ll be boun\u0027 they\u0027d \u0027a bin some ole sco\u0027es settled then an\u0027 thar if ole sco\u0027es ken be settled by a frailin\u0027. But, bless your heart, they wa\u0027n\u0027t never no cammer \u0027oman than what Emily Wornum was; an\u0027 if you\u0027d \u0027a know\u0027d \u0027er, an\u0027 Mingo wa\u0027n\u0027t here to b\u0027ar me out, I wish I may die if I wouldn\u0027t be afeared to tell you how ca\u0027m an\u0027 supjued that \u0027oman was, which in her young days she was a tarrifier. She up an\u0027 says, says she— \"\u0027Is Mizzers Bivins in?\u0027 \"\u0027Yessum,\u0027 says I, \u0027she is that-away. An more \u0027n that, nobody don\u0027t hafter come on this hill an\u0027 holler more \u0027n twicet \u0027thout gittin\u0027some kinder answer back. Yessum! An\u0027 what\u0027s more, Mizzers Bivins is come to that time er life when she\u0027s mighty proud to git calls from the big- bugs. If I had as much perliteness, ma\u0027am, as I is cheers, I\u0027d ast you to set down,\u0027 says I. \"She stood thar, she did, thes as cool as a cowcumber; but d\u0027reckly she ups an\u0027 says, says she— \"\u0027Might I see my little gran\u0027chile?\u0027 says she. \"\u0027Oho, ma\u0027am!\u0027 says I; \u0027things is come to a mighty purty pass when quality folks has to go frum house to house a-huntin\u0027 up pore white trash, an\u0027 a-astin\u0027 airter the\u0027r kin. Tooby shore! tooby shore! Yessum, a mighty purty pass,\u0027 says I.\" I cannot hope to give even a faint intimation of the remarkable dramatic fervour and earnestness of this recital, nor shall I attempt to describe the rude eloquence of attitude and expression; but they seemed to represent the real or fancied wrongs of a class, and to spring from the pent-up rage of a century. \"I wa\u0027n\u0027t lookin\u0027 fer no compermise, nuther,\" Mrs. Bivins continued. \"I fully spected \u0027er to flar\u0027 up an\u0027 fly at me; but \u0027stedder that, she kep\u0027 a- stan\u0027in\u0027 thar lookin\u0027 thes like folks does when theyer runnin\u0027 over sump\u0027n in the\u0027r min\u0027. Then her eye lit on some \u0027er the pictur\u0027s what Deely had hung up on the side er the house, an\u0027 in pertic\u0027lar one what some \u0027er the Woruum niggers had fetched \u0027er, whar a great big dog was a-watehin\u0027 by a little bit er baby. When she seen that, bless your soul, she thes sunk right down on the floor, an\u0027 clincht \u0027er han\u0027s, an\u0027 brung a gasp what looked like it might er bin the last, an\u0027 d\u0027reckly she ast, in a whisper, says she— \"\u0027Was this my dear daughter\u0027s room?\u0027 \"Maybe you think,\" said Mrs. Bivins, regarding me coldly and critically, and pressing her thin lips more firmly together, if that could be—\"maybe you think I oughter wrung my han\u0027s, an\u0027 pitied that \u0027oman kneelin\u0027 thar in that room whar all my trouble was born an\u0027 bred. Some folks would \u0027a flopped down by \u0027er, an\u0027 I won\u0027t deny but what hit come over me; but the nex\u0027 minnit hit flashed acrost me as quick an\u0027 hot as powder how she\u0027d \u0027a bin a-houndin\u0027 airter me an\u0027 my son, an\u0027 a-treatin\u0027 us like as we\u0027d \u0027a bin the offscourin\u0027s er creation, an\u0027 how she cast off her own daughter, which Deely was as good a gal as ever draw\u0027d the breath er life—when all this come over me, hit seem like to me that I couldn\u0027t keep my paws off\u0027n \u0027er. I hope the Lord\u0027ll forgive me—that I do—but if hit hadn\u0027t but \u0027a bin for my raisin\u0027, I\u0027d \u0027a jumped at Emily Wornum an\u0027 \u0027a spit in \u0027er face an\u0027 \u0027a clawed \u0027er eyes out\u0027n \u0027er. An\u0027 yit, with ole Nick a-tuggin\u0027 at me, I was a Christun \u0027nuff to thank the Lord that they was a tender place in that pore miserbul creetur\u0027s soul-case. \"When I seen her a-kneelin\u0027 thar, with \u0027er year-rings a-danglin\u0027 an\u0027 \u0027er fine feathers a-tossin\u0027 an\u0027 a-trimblin\u0027, leetle more an\u0027 my thoughts would \u0027a sot me afire. I riz an\u0027 I stood over her, an\u0027 I says, says I— \"\u0027Emily Wornum, whar you er huntin\u0027 the dead you oughter hunted the livin\u0027. What\u0027s betwix\u0027 you an\u0027 your Maker I can\u0027t tell,\u0027 says I, \u0027but if you git down on your face an\u0027 lick the dirt what Deely Bivins walked on, still you won\u0027t be humble enough for to go whar she\u0027s gone, nor good enough nuther. She died right yer while you was a-traipsin\u0027 an\u0027 a- trollopin\u0027 roun\u0027 frum pos\u0027 to pillar a-upholdin\u0027 your quality idees. These arms helt \u0027er,\u0027 says I, \u0027an\u0027 ef hit hadn\u0027t but \u0027a bin for her, Emily Wornum,\u0027 says I, \u0027I\u0027d \u0027a strangled the life out\u0027n you time your shadder darkened my door. An\u0027 what\u0027s more,\u0027 says I, \u0027ef youer come to bother airter Pud, the make the trail of it. Thes so much as lay the weight er your little finger on \u0027er,\u0027 says I, \u0027an\u0027 I\u0027ll grab you by the goozle an\u0027 t\u0027ar your haslet out,\u0027 says I.\" O mystery of humanity! It was merely Mrs. Feratia Bivins who had been speaking, but the voice was the voice of Tragedy. Its eyes shone; its fangs glistened and gleamed; its hands clutched the air; its tone was husky with suppressed fury; its rage would have stormed the barriers of the grave. In another moment Mrs. Bivins was brushing the crumbs from her lap, and exchanging salutations with her neighbours and acquaintances; and a little later, leading her grandchild by the hand, she was making her way back to the church, where the congregation had begun to gather. III. FOR my own part, I preferred to remain under the trees, and I soon found that this was the preference of Mingo. The old man had finished his dinner, and sat at the foot of a gigantic oak, gazing dreamily at the fleecy clouds that sailed across the sky. His hands were clasped above his head, and his attitude was one of reflection. The hymn with which the afternoon services were opened came through the woods with a distinctness that was not without a remote and curious suggestion of pathos. As it died away, Mingo raised himself slightly, and said, in a tone that was intended to be explanatory, if not apologetic— \"Miss F\u0027raishy, ef she ain\u0027t one sight, den I ain\u0027t never seed none. I s\u0027pec\u0027 it seem sorter funny ter you, boss, but dat w\u0027ite \u0027oman done had lots er trouble; she done had bunnunce er trouble—she sholy is! Look mighty cu\u0027us dat some folks can\u0027t git useter yuther folks w\u0027at got Fergiuny ways, but dat\u0027s Miss F\u0027raishy up en down. Dat\u0027s her, sho! Ole Miss en ole Marster dey had Ferginny ways, en Miss F\u0027raishy she wouldn\u0027t \u0027a staid in a ten-acre fiel\u0027 wid urn—dat she wouldn\u0027t. Folks wa\u0027t got Ferginny ways, Miss F\u0027raishy she call um big-bugs, en she git hostile w\u0027en she year der name call. Hit\u0027s de same way wid niggers. Miss F\u0027raishy she hate de common run er niggers like dey wuz pizen. Yit I ain\u0027t makin\u0027 no complaints, kaze she mighty good ter me. I goes en I suns myse\u0027f in Miss F\u0027raishy back peazzer all day Sundays, w\u0027en dey ain\u0027t no meetin\u0027s gwine on, en all endurin\u0027 er de week I hangs \u0027roun\u0027 en ploughs a little yer, en hoes a little dar, en scratches a little yander, en looks arter ole Miss\u0027 gran\u0027chile. But des let \u0027n\u0027er nigger so much ez stick der chin \u0027cross de yard palin\u0027s, en, bless yo\u0027 soul, you\u0027ll year Miss F\u0027raishy blaze out like de woods done cotch afire.\" Mingo paused here to chuckle over the discomfiture and alarm of the imaginary negro who had had the temerity to stick his supposititious chin over the fence. Then he went on— \"I dunner whar Miss F\u0027raishy git do notion \u0027bout dat chile a-faverin\u0027 er de Wornums, kaze she de ve\u0027y spit en image er ole Miss, en ole Miss wuz a full-blood Bushrod. De Bushrods is de fambly what I cum fum myse\u0027f, kaze w\u0027en ole Miss marry Marster, my mammy fell ter her, en w\u0027en I got big \u0027nuff, dey tuck me in de house fer ter wait on de table en do er\u0027n\u0027s, en dar I bin twel freedom come out. She \u0027uz mighty high- strung, ole Miss wuz, yit I sees folks dese days put on mo\u0027 a\u0027rs dan w\u0027at ole Miss ever is. I ain\u0027t \u0027sputin\u0027 but w\u0027at she hilt \u0027er head high, en I year my mammy say dat all the Bushrods in Ferginny done zactly dat a way. \"High-strung yer, headstrong yander,\" continued Mingo, closing one eye, and gazing at the sun with a confidential air. \"Ef it hadn\u0027t er bin fer de high-strungity-head-strongityness er de Bushrod blood, Miss Deely wouldn\u0027t \u0027a never runn\u0027d off wid Clay Bivins in de roun\u0027 worril, dough he \u0027uz des one er de nicest w\u0027ite mens w\u0027at you \u0027mos\u0027 ever laid yo\u0027 eyes on. Soon ez she done dat, wud went \u0027roun\u0027 fum de big house dat de nigger w\u0027at call Miss Deely name on dat plantation would be clap on de cote-house block, en ole Miss she shot \u0027erse\u0027f up, she did, en arter dat mighty few folks got a glimpse un \u0027er, \u0027ceppin\u0027 hit \u0027uz some er de kin, en bless yo\u0027 soul, dey hatter look mighty prim w\u0027en dey come whar she wuz. Ole Marster he ain\u0027t say nothin\u0027, but he tuck a fresh grip on de jimmy-john, en it got so dat, go whar you would, dey want no mo\u0027 lonesomer place on de face er de yeth dan dat Wornum plantation, en hit look like ruination done sot in. En den, on top er dat, yer come de war, en Clay Bivins he went off en got kilt, en den freedom come out, en des \u0027bout dat time Miss Deely she tuck \u0027n\u0027 die. \"I \u0027clar\u0027 ter gracious,\" exclaimed Mingo, closing his eyes and frowning heavily, \"w\u0027en I looks back over my shoulder at dem times, hit seem like it mighty funny dat any un us pull thoo. Some did en some didn\u0027t, en dem w\u0027at did, dey look like deyer mighty fergitful. W\u0027en de smash come, ole Marster he call us niggers up, he did, en \u0027low dat we \u0027uz all free. Some er de boys \u0027low dat dey wuz a-gwineter see ef dey wuz free sho \u0027nuff, en wid dat dey put out fer town, en some say ef dey wuz free dey wuz free ter stay. Some talk one way en some talk \u0027n\u0027er. I let you know I kep\u0027 my mouf shot, yit my min\u0027 \u0027uz brimful er trouble. \"Bimeby soon one mornin\u0027 I make a break. I wrop up my little han\u0027ful er duds in a hankcher, en I tie de hankcher on my walkin\u0027-cane, en I put out arter de army. I walk en I walk, en \u0027bout nine dat night I come ter Ingram Ferry. De flat wuz on t\u0027er side er de river, en de man w\u0027at run it look like he gone off some\u0027rs. I holler en I whoop, en I whoop en I holler, but ef dey wuz any man \u0027roun\u0027, he wuz hidin\u0027 out fum me. Arter so long I got tired er whoopin\u0027 en hollerin\u0027, en I went ter de nighest house en borrer\u0027d a chunk, en built me a fier by de side er de road, en I set dar en nod twel I git sleepy, en den I pull my blanket \u0027cross my head en quile up—en w\u0027en I do dat, hit\u0027s good-bye, Mingo! \"Boss,\" said Mingo, after a little pause, \"you don\u0027t b\u0027leeve in no ghos\u0027es en sperrits, does you?\" An apparently irrelevant inquiry, suddenly put, is sometimes confusing, and I fear I did not succeed in convincing Mingo of my unbelief. \"Some does en some don\u0027t,\" he continued, \"but ez fer me, you kin des put me sorter \u0027twix\u0027 en between. Dey mout be ghos\u0027es en den ag\u0027in dey moutent. Ole nigger like me ain\u0027t got no bizness takin\u0027 sides, en dat w\u0027at make I say w\u0027at I does. I ain\u0027t mo\u0027n kivver my head wid dat blanket en shot my eyes, \u0027fo\u0027 I year somebody a-callin\u0027 un me. Fus\u0027 hit soun\u0027 way off yander. \"\u0027Mingo!—oh, Mingo!\u0027 en den hit got nigher—\u0027Mingo !—oh, Mingo!\u0027 \"I ain\u0027t \u0027spon\u0027 ter dat, but I lay dar, I did, en I say ter myse\u0027f— \"\u0027Bless gracious! de man on t\u0027er side done come, but how in de name er goodness is he know Mingo?\u0027 \"I lay dar, en I study en I lissen, en I lissen en I study; en den I doze off like, en fus\u0027 news I know yer come de call— \"\u0027Mingo!—oh, Mingo!\u0027 \"Hit soun\u0027 nigher, yit hit seem like it come fum a mighty fur ways, en den wiles I wundin\u0027 en studyin\u0027, yer she come mo\u0027 plainer dan befo\u0027— \"\u0027OH, MINGO!\u0027 \"I snatch de blanket offn my head, en sot up en lissen, I did, en den I make answer— \"\u0027Who dat callin\u0027 Mingo way out yer?\u0027 \"I lissen en I lissen, but nobody ain\u0027t callin\u0027. I year de water sneakin\u0027 \u0027long under de bank, en I year de win\u0027 squeezin\u0027 en shufflin\u0027 \u0027long thoo de trees, en I year de squinch-owl shiver\u0027n\u0027 like he cole, but I ain\u0027t year no callin\u0027. Dis make me feel sorter jubous like, but I lay down en wrop up my head. \"I ain\u0027t bin dar long \u0027fo\u0027 bimeby yer come de call, en it soun\u0027 right at me. Hit rise en it fall, en de wud wuz— \"\u0027Mingo!—oh, Mingo! Whar my little baby? My little baby, Mingo! Whar my little, baby?\u0027 \"En den, boss, hit seem like I year sump\u0027n like a \u0027oman cryin\u0027 in de dark like \u0027er heart gwineter break. You kin laff ef you mineter, but I ain\u0027t dast ter take dat blanket offn my head, kaze I know my young mistiss done come back, en mo\u0027n dat, I know sho \u0027uz stannin\" dar right over me. \"Tooby sho I wuz skeer\u0027d, but I wa\u0027n\u0027t so skeer\u0027d dat I dunner w\u0027at she mean, en I des broke inter de bigges\u0027 kinder boo-hoo, en I say, sez I— \"\u0027Make yo\u0027 peace, Miss Deely! make yo\u0027 peace, honey! kaze I gwine right back ter dat baby ef de Lord spar\u0027 me. I gwine back, Miss Deely! I gwine back!\u0027 \"Bless yo\u0027 soul, boss, right den en dar I know\u0027d w\u0027at bin a- pester\u0027n\u0027 un me, kaze des time I make up my min\u0027 fer ter come back ter dat baby, hit look like I see my way mo\u0027 cle\u0027r dan w\u0027at it bin befo\u0027. Arter dat I lay dar, I did, en I lissen en I lissen, but I ain\u0027t year no mo\u0027 callin\u0027 en no mo\u0027 cryin\u0027; en bimeby I tuck de blanket fum off\u0027n my head, en lo en beholes, de stars done fade out, en day done come, en dey wa\u0027n\u0027t no fuss nowhars. De squinch-owl done hush, en de win\u0027 done gone, en it look like de water done stop sneakin\u0027 en crawlin\u0027 und\u0027 de bank. \"I riz up, I did, en shuck de stift\u0027nes out\u0027n my bones, en I look \u0027way \u0027cross de river ter de top er de hill whar de road lead. I look en I say, sez I— \"\u0027Maybe you leads ter freedom, but, bless God! I gwine back.\u0027 \"Des \u0027bout dat time I see de fe\u0027ymun come down ter de flat en onloose de chain, en make ez he wuz comin\u0027 \u0027cross arter me. Wid dat I raise up my hat en tip \u0027im a bow, en dat\u0027s de las\u0027 I seed un \u0027im. \"I come back, I did,\" continued Mingo, reflectively, \"en yer I is, en yer I bin; en I ain\u0027t come none too soon, en I ain\u0027t stay none too close, n\u0027er, kaze I dunuer w\u0027at mout er happin. Miss F\u0027raishy been mighty good, too, sho. She ain\u0027t useter niggers like some w\u0027ite folks, en she can\u0027t git \u0027long wid um, but she puts up wid me mighty well. I tuck holt er de little piece er groun\u0027 w\u0027at she had, en by de he\u0027p er de Lord we bin gittin on better dan lots er folks. It bin nip en tuck, but ole tuck come out ahead, en it done got so now dat Miss P\u0027raishy kin put by some er de cotton money fer ter give de little gal a chance w\u0027en she git bigger. \u0027Twon\u0027t b\u0027ar tellin\u0027 how smart dat chile is. She got Miss Deely peanner, en, little ez she is, she kin pick mos\u0027 all de chunes w\u0027at her mammy useter pick. She sets at de peanner by de hour, en whar she larnt it I be bless ef I kin tell you—dat I can\u0027t!\" The little girl had grown tired of the services in the church, and ran out just as the old man had put my horse to the buggy. Mingo knew a shorter road to Rockville than that by which I had come, and taking the child by the hand, he walked on ahead to show me the way. In a little while we came to the brow of a hill, and here I bade the old man and his charge good-bye, and the two stood watching me as I drove away. Presently a cloud of dust rose between us, and I saw them no more, but I brought away a very pretty picture in my mind—Mingo with his hat raised in farewell, the sunshine falling gently upon his grey hairs, and the little girl clinging to his hand and daintily throwing kisses after me. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2807/77577.html","bookId":506,"book":{"id":506,"title":"Mingo And Other Sketches in Black and White","description":"简介： IN 1876, circumstances, partly accidental and partly sentimental, led me to revisit Crooked Creek Church, near the little village of Rockville, in Middle Georgia.
