{"id":21687,"no":4,"title":"BLUE DAVE.","content":"I. THE atmosphere of mystery that surrounds the Kendrick Place in Putnam County is illusive, of course; but the illusion is perfect. The old house, standing a dozen yards from the roadside, is picturesque with the contrivances of neglect and decay. Through a door hanging loose upon its hinges the passer-by may behold the evidences of loneliness and gloom,—the very embodiment of desolation,—a void, a silence, that is almost portentous. The roof, with its crop of quaint gables, in which proportion has been sacrificed to an effort to attain architectural liveliness, is covered with a greenish- grey moss on the north side, and has long been given over to decay on all sides. The cat- squirrels that occasionally scamper across the crumbling shingles have as much as they can do, with all their nimbleness, to find a secure foot-hold. The huge wooden columns that support the double veranda display jagged edges at top and bottom, and no longer make even a pretence of hiding their grim hollowness. The well, hospitably placed within arm\u0027s reach of the highway, for the benefit of the dead and buried congregation that long ago met and worshipped at Bethesda meeting-house, is stripped of windlass, chain, and bucket. All the outhouses have disappeared, if they ever had an existence; and nothing remains to tell the story of a flourishing era, save a fig-tree, which is graciously green and fruitful in season. This fig-tree has grown to an extraordinary height, and covers a large area with its canopy of limbs and leaves, giving a sort of Oriental flavour to the illusion of mystery and antiquity. It is said of this fig-tree that sermons have been preached and marriages solemnised under its wide-spreading branches; and there is a vague tradition to the effect that a duel was once fought in its shadow by some of the hot-bloods. But no harm will come of respectfully but firmly doubting this tradition; for it is a fact, common to both memory and observation, that duels, even in the old days, when each and every one of us was the pink of chivalry and the soul of honour, were much rarer than the talk of them. Nevertheless, the confession may be made that without such a tradition a fig-tree surrounded by so many evidences of neglect and decay would be a tame affair indeed. The house, with its double veranda, its tall chimneys, and its curious collection of gables, was built as late as 1836 by young Felix Kendrick, in order, as Grandsir Kendrick declared, to show that \"some folks was as good as other folks.\" Whether Felix succeeded in this or not, it is impossible to gather from either local history or tradition; but there is no doubt that the house attracted attention, for its architectural liveliness has never to this day been duplicated in that region. In those days the Kendrick family was a new one, so to speak, but ambitious. Grandsir Kendrick—a fatal title in itself—was a hatter by trade, who had come to Georgia in search of a precarious livelihood. He obtained permission to build him a little log hut by the side of a running stream; and, for a year or two, people going along the road could hear the snap and twang of his bowstring as he whipped wool or rabbit fur into shape. Some said he was from North Carolina; others said he was from Connecticut; but whether from one State or the other, what should a hatter do away off in the woods in Putnam County? Grandsir Kendrick, who was shrewd, close-fisted, and industrious, did what any sensible man would have done: he became an overseer. In this business, which required no capital, he developed considerable executive ability. The plantations he had charge of paid large profits to their owners, and he found his good management in demand. He commanded a large salary, and saved money. This money he invested in negroes, buying one at a time and hiring them out. He finally came to be the owner of seven or eight stout field hands; whereupon he bought two hundred acres of choice land, and set himself up as a patriarch. Grandsir Kendrick kept to his sober ways, continued his good management, and, in the midst of much shabbiness, continued to put aside money in the shape of negroes. He also reared a son, who contrived somehow to have higher notions than his father. These notions of young Felix Kendrick were confirmed and enlarged by his marriage to the daughter of a Methodist circuit-rider. This young lady had been pinched by poverty often enough to know the value of economy, while the position of her father had given her advantages which the most fortunate young ladies of that day might have envied. In short, Mrs. Felix turned out to be a very superior woman in all respects. She was proud as well as pretty, and managed to hold her own with the element which Grandsir Kendrick sometimes dubiously referred to as \"the quality.\" The fact that Mrs. Felix\u0027s mother was a Barksdale probably had something to do with her energy and tact; but whatever the cause of her popularity may have been, Grandsir Kendrick was very proud of his son\u0027s wife. He had no sympathy with, and no part in, her high notions; but their manifestation afforded him the spectacle of an experience entirely foreign to his own. Here was his son\u0027s wife stepping high, and compelling his son to step high. So far as Grandsir Kendrick was concerned, however, it was merely a spectacle. To the day of his death, he never ceased to higgle over a thrip, and it was his constant boast that in his own experience it had always been convenient to give prudence the upper hand of pride. In 1850 the house was not showing many signs of decay, but young Mrs. Felix had become the widow Kendrick, her daughter Kitty bad grown to be a beautiful young woman, and her son Felix was a lad of remarkable promise. The loss of her husband was a great blow to Mrs. Kendrick. With all her business qualities, her affection for her family and her home was strongly marked, and her husband stood first as the head and centre of each. Felix Kendrick died in the latter part of November 1849, and his widow made him a grave under the shadow of a tree he had planted when a boy, and in full view of her window. The obsequies were very simple. A prayer was said, and a song was sung; that was all. But it was understood that the funeral sermon would be preached at the house by Mrs. Kendrick\u0027s brother, who was on his way home from China, where he had been engaged in converting (to use a neighbourhood phrase) the \"squinch-eyed heathen.\" The weeks went by, and the missionary brother returned; and one Sunday morning in February it was given out at Bethesda that \"on the first Sabbath after the second Tuesday in March, the funeral sermon of Brother Felix Kendrick will be preached at the house by Brother Garwood.\" On the morning of this particular Sunday, which was selected because it did not conflict with the services of the Bethesda congregation, two neighbours met in the forks of the public road that leads to Rockville. Each had come from a different direction. One was riding and one was walking; and both were past the middle time of life. \"Well met, Brother Roach!\" exclaimed the man on horseback. \"You\u0027ve took the words from my mouth, Brother Brannum. I hope you are well. I\u0027m peart myself, but not as peart as I thought I was, bekaze I find that the two or three miles to come is sticking in my craw.\" \"Ah, when it comes to that, Brother Roach,\" said the man on horseback, \"you and me can be one another\u0027s looking-glass. Look on me, and you\u0027ll see what time has done for you.\" \"Not so, Brother Brannum! Not so!\" exclaimed the other. \"There\u0027s some furrows on your forrud, and a handful of bird- tracks below your eyes that would ill become me; and I\u0027m plumper in the make-up, you\u0027ll allow.\" \"Yes, yes, Brother Johnny Roach,\" said Brother Brannum, frowning a little; \"but what of that? Death takes no time to feel for wrinkles and furrows, and nuther does plumpness stand in the way. Look at Brother Felix Kendrick,—took off in the very pulse and power of his prime, you may say. Yet, Providence permitting, I am to hark to his funeral to-day.\" \"Why, so am I,—so am I,\" exclaimed Brother Roach. \"We seem to agree, Brother Brannum, like the jay-bird and the joree,—one in the tree and t\u0027other on the ground.\" Brother Brannum\u0027s grim sense of superiority showed itself in his calm smile. \"Yet I\u0027ll not deny,\" continued Brother Roach, flinging his coat, which he had been carrying on his arm, across his shoulder, \"that sech discourses go ag\u0027in the grain It frets me in the mind for to hear what thundering great men folks git to be arter they are dead, though I hope we may both follow suit, Brother Brannum.\" \"But how, Brother Johnny Roach?\" \"Why, by the grace of big discourses, Brother Brannum. There \u0027a many a preacher could close down the Bible on his hankcher and make our very misdeeds smell sweet as innocence. It\u0027s all in the lift of the eyebrow, and the gesticures of the hand. So old Neighbour Harper says, and he\u0027s been a lawyer and a schoolmaster in his day and time.\". \"Still,\" said Brother Brannum, as if acknowledging the arguments, \"I think Sister Kendrick is jestified in her desires.\" \"Oh, yes,—oh, yes!\" replied Brother Roach, heartily; \"none more so. Felix Kendrick\u0027s ways is in good shape for some preacher wi\u0027 a glib tongue. Felix was a good man; he wanted his just dues, but not if to take them would hurt a man. He was neighbourly; who more so? And, sir, when you got to rastlin\u0027 wi\u0027 trouble, he\u0027d find you and fetch you out. I only hope the Chinee preacher\u0027ll be jedgmatical enough for to let us off wi\u0027 the simple truth.\" \"They say,\" said Brother Brannum, \"that he\u0027s a man full of grace and fire.\" \"Well, sir,\" said Johnny Roach, \"if he but makes me disremember that I left the bay mar\u0027 at home, I\u0027ll thank him kindly.\" \"Mercy, Brother Roach,\" exclaimed Brother Brannum, taking this as a neighbourly hint, \"mount up here and rest yourself, whilst I stretch my legs along this level piece of ground.\" \"I\u0027d thank you kindly, Brother Branuum, if you wouldn\u0027t so misjudge me! It\u0027s my will to walk; but if I git my limbs sot to the saddle here and now, they\u0027d ache and crack might\u0027ly when next I called upon \u0027em. I\u0027ll take the will for the deed, Brother Brannum.\" Thus these neighbours jogged along to Felix Kendrick\u0027s funeral. They found a great crowd ahead of them when they got there, though they were not too late for the services; but the house was filled with sympathetic men and women, and those who came late were compelled to find such accommodations as the yard afforded; and these accommodations were excellent in their way, for there was the cool green grass under the trees, and there were the rustic seats in the shadow of the fig-tree of which mention has been made. Coming together, Brother Brannum and Brother Roach stayed together; and they soon found themselves comfortably seated under the fig-tree,—a point of view from which they could observe everything that was going on. Brother Brannum, who was a pillar of Bethesda church, and extremely officious withal, seemed to regret that he had not arrived soon enough to find a place in the house near the preacher, but Brother Roach appeared to congratulate himself that he had been crowded out of ear-shot. \"We can set here,\" he declared in great good-humour, \"and hear the singing, and then whirl in and preach each man his own sermon. I know better than the furrin preacher what\u0027d be satisfactual to Felix Kendrick. I see George Denham sailing in and out and flying around; and if the pinch comes, as come it must, Brother Brannum, we can up and ast George for to fetch us sech reports as a hongry man can stomach.\" Brother Brannum frowned heavily, but made no response. Presently Brother Roach beckoned to the young man whom he had called George Denham. \"Howdy, George! How is Kitty Kendrick? Solemn as the season is, George, I lay \u0027twould be wrong for to let Beauty pine.\" The young man suppressed a smile, and raised his hands in protest. \"Uncle Johnny! to joke me at such a time! I shall go to-morrow and cut your mill-race, and you will never know who did it.\" \"Ah, George! if death changes a man no more\u0027n they say it does, little does Felix Kendrick need to be holp by these dismal takings-on. From first to last, he begrudged no man his banter. But here we are, and yan\u0027s the preacher. The p\u0027int wi\u0027 me, George, is, how kin we-all setting on the back seats know when the preacher gits to his \u0027amen,\u0027 onless his expoundance is too loud to be becoming?\" \"Come, now, Uncle Johnny,\" said young Denham, \"no winking, and I\u0027ll tell you. I was talking to Miss Kitty just now, and all of a sudden she cried out, \u0027Why, yonder\u0027s Uncle Johnny Roach, and he\u0027s walking, too. Uncle Johnny must stay to dinner;\u0027 and Mrs. Kendrick says, \u0027Yes, and Brother Branmim too.\u0027 And so there you are.\" \"Well, sir,\" exclaimed Brother Roach, \"Kitty always had a piece of my heart, and now she has it all.\" \"A likely young man, that George Denham,\" said Brother Brannum, as Denham moved towards the house. \"You never spoke a truer word, Brother Brannum,\" said Brother Roach, enthusiastically. \"Look at his limbs, look at his gait, look at his eye. If the world, the flesh, and the devil don\u0027t freeze out his intents, you\u0027ll hear from that chap. He\u0027s a-gitting high up in the law, and where\u0027ll you find a better managed plantation than his\u0027n?\" What else Brother Roach said or might have said must be left to conjecture. In the midst of his eulogy on the living, the preacher in the house began his eulogy of the dead. Those who heard what he said were much edified, and those who failed to hear made a decorous pretence of listening intently. In the midst of the sermon Brother Roach felt himself touched on the arm. Looking up, he saw that Brother Brannum was gazing intently at one of the gables on the roof. Following the direction of Brother Brannum\u0027s eyes, Brother Roach beheld, with astonishment not unmixed with awe, the head and shoulders of a powerfully built negro. The attitude of the negro was one of attention. He was evidently trying to hear the sermon. His head was bent, and the expression of his face was indicative of great good-humour. His shirt was ragged and dirty, and had fallen completely away from one arm and shoulder, and the billowy muscles glistened in the sun. While Brother Brannum and Brother Roach were gazing at him with some degree of amazement, an acorn dropped upon the roof from one of the tall oaks. Startled by the sudden noise, the negro glanced hurriedly around, and dropped quickly below the line of vision. \"Well, well, well!\" exclaimed Brother Roach, after exchanging a look of amazement with Brother Brannum. \"Well, well, well! Who\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 thought it? Once \u0027twas the nigger in the wood-pile; now it\u0027s the nigger in the steeple, and arter a while they\u0027ll be a-flying in the air,—mark my words. I call that the impidence of the Old Boy. Maybe you don\u0027t know that nigger, Brother Brannum?\" \"I disremember if I do, Brother Roach.\" \"Well, sir, when one of \u0027em passes in front of your Uncle Johnny, you may up and sw\u0027ar his dagarrytype is took. That nigger, roosting up there so slick and cool, is Bledser\u0027s Blue Dave. Nuther more, nuther less.\" \"Bledser\u0027s Blue Dave!\" exclaimed Brother Brannum in a voice made sepulchral by amazement. \"The identical nigger! I\u0027d know him if I met him arm-in-arm with the King and Queen of France.\" \"Why, I thought Blue Dave had made his disappearance five year ago,\" said Brother Brannum. \"Well, sir, my two eyes tells me different. Time and time ag\u0027in I\u0027ve been told he\u0027s a quare creetur. Some say he\u0027s strong as a horse and venomous as a snake. Some say he\u0027s swifter than the wind and slicker than a red fox. And many\u0027s the time by my own h\u0027a\u0027th-stone I\u0027ve had to pooh-pooh these relations; yet there\u0027s no denying that for mighty nigh seven year that nigger\u0027s been trolloping round through the woods foot-loose and scotch-free, bidding defiance to the law of the State and Bill Brand\u0027s track dogs.\" \"Well, sir,\" said Brother Brannum, fetching his hand down on his knee with a thwack, \"we ought to alarm the assemblage.\" \"Jes so,\" replied Brother Roach, with something like a chuckle; \"but you forgit the time and the occasion, Brother Brannum. I\u0027m a worldly man myself, as you may say, but \u0027twill be long arter I\u0027m more worldlier than what I am before you can ketch me cuttin\u0027 sech a scollop as to wind up a funeral sermon wi\u0027 a race arter a runaway nigger.\" Brother Brannum agreed with this view, but it was with a poor grace. He had a vague remembrance of certain rewards that had from time to time been offered for the capture of Blue Dave, and he was anxious to have a hand in securing at least a part of these. But he refrained from sounding the alarm. With Brother Roach, he remained at the Kendrick Place after the sermon was over, and took dinner. He rode off shortly afterwards, and the next day Bill Brand and his track dogs put in an appearance; but Blue Dave was gone. It was a common thing to hear of fugitive negroes; but Blue Dave (so called because of the inky blackness of his skin) had a name and a fame that made him the terror of the women and children, both white and black; and Kitty Kendrick and her mother were not a little disturbed when they learned that he had been in hiding among the gables of their house. The negro\u0027s success in eluding pursuit caused the ignorant-minded of both races to attribute to him the possession of some mysterious power. He grew into a legend; he became a part of the folk-lore of the section. According to popular belief, he possessed strange powers and great courage; he became a giant, a spirit of evil. Women frightened their children into silence by calling his name, and many a youngster crept to bed in mortal fear that Blue Dave would come in the night and whisk him away into the depths of the dark woods. Whatever mischief was done was credited to Blue Dave. If a horse was found in the lot spattered with mud, Blue Dave had ridden it; if a cow was crippled, a hog missing, or a smoke-house robbed, Blue Dave was sure to be at the bottom of it all, so far as popular belief was concerned. The negroes had many stories to tell of him. One had seen him standing by a tall poplar-tree. He was about to speak to him when there came a flash of lightning and a crash of thunder, and Blue Dave disappeared, leaving a sulphurous smell behind him. He had been seen by another negro. He was standing in the middle of the Armour\u0027s Ferry road. He was armed with a gleaming reaphook, and accompanied by a big black dog. As soon as the dog saw the new-comer, it bristled up from head to foot, its eyes shone like two coals of fire, and every hair on its back emitted a fiery spark. Very little was known of the history of Blue Dave. He was brought to the little village of Rockville in chains in a speculator\u0027s train,—the train consisting of two Conestoga wagons and thirty or forty forlorn-looking negroes. The speculator explained that he had manacled Blue Dave because he was unmanageable; and he put him on the block to sell him after making it perfectly clear to everybody that whoever bought the negro would get a bad bargain. Nevertheless Blue Dave was a magnificent specimen of manhood, straight as an arrow, as muscular as Hercules, and with a countenance as open and as pleasant as one would wish to see. He was bought by General Alfred Bledser, and put on his River Place. He worked well for a few weeks, but got into trouble with the overseer, and finally compromised matters by taking to the woods. He seemed born for this particular business; for the track dogs failed to find him, and all the arts and artifices employed for capturing and reclaiming runaways failed in his case. It was a desperate sort of freedom he enjoyed; but he seemed suited to it, and he made the most of it. As might be supposed, there was great commotion in the settlement, and particularly at the Kendrick homestead, when it was known that Blue Dave had been hiding among the gables of the Kendrick house. Mrs. Kendrick and her daughter Kitty possessed their full share of what Brother Roach would have called \"spunk;\" but there is a large and very important corner of the human mind—particularly if it happens to be a feminine mind—which devotes itself to superstition; and these gentle ladies, while they stood in no terror of Blue Dave as a runaway negro simply, were certainly awed by the spectral figure which had grown up out of common report. The house negroes stood in mortal dread of Blue Dave, and their dismay was not without its effect upon Mrs. Kendrick and her daughter. Jenny, the house-girl, refused to sleep at the quarters; and when Aunt Tabby, the cook, started for her cabin after dark, she was accompanied by a number of little negroes bearing lightwood torches. All the stories and legends that clustered around Blue Dave\u0027s career were brought to the surface again; and, as we have seen, the great majority of them were anything but reassuring. II. WHILE the commotion in the settlement and on the Kendrick Place was at its height, an incident occurred that had a tendency to relieve Kitty Kendrick\u0027s mind. Shortly after the funeral the spring rains had set in, and for several days great floods came down from the skies. One evening shortly after dark, Kitty Kendrick stepped out upon the veranda, in an aimless sort of way, to look at the clouds. The rain had ceased, but the warm earth was reeking with moisture. The trees and the ground were smoking with fog, and great banks of vapour were whirling across the sky from the south-west. Kitty sighed. After a while George Denham would go rattling by in his buggy from his law office in Rockyille to his plantation, and it was too dark to catch a glimpse of him. At any rate, she would do the best she could. She would put the curtains of the sitting-room back, so the light could shine out, and perhaps George would stop to warm his hands and say a word to her mother. Kitty turned to go in when she heard her name called— \"Miss Kitty!\" \"Well, what is it?\" Kitty was startled a little in spite of herself. \"Please, ma\u0027am, don\u0027t be skeer\u0027d.\" \"Why should I be frightened? What do you want?\" \"Miss Kitty, I des come by fer ter tell you dat Murder Creek done come way out er its banks, en ef Mars. George Denham come by w\u0027en he gwine on home, I wish you please, ma\u0027am, be so good ez ter tell \u0027im dat dey ain\u0027t no fordin\u0027-place fer ter be foun\u0027 dar dis night.\" The voice was that of a negro, and there was something in the tone of it that arrested Kitty Kendrick\u0027s attention. \"Who sent you?\" she asked. \"Nobody ain\u0027t sont me; I des come by myse\u0027f. I laid off fer ter tell Mars. George, but I year talk he mighty headstrong, en I speck he des laugh at me.\" \"Are you one of our hands?\" \"No, \u0027m; I don\u0027t b\u0027long on de Kendrick Place.\" \"Come out of the shadow there where I can see you.\" \"I mos\u0027 fear\u0027d, Miss Kitty.\" \"What is your name?\" \"Dey calls me Blue Dave, ma\u0027am.\" The tone of the voice was something more than humble. There was an appeal in it for mercy. Kitty Kendrick recognised this; but in spite of it she could scarcely resist an impulse to rush into the house, lock the door, and take steps to rouse the whole plantation. By a great effort she did resist it, and the negro went on:— \"Please, ma\u0027am, don\u0027t be skeer\u0027d er me, Miss Kitty. De Lord years me w\u0027en I say it, dey ain\u0027t a ha\u0027r er yo\u0027 head dat I\u0027d hurt, dat dey ain\u0027t. I ain\u0027t bad like dey make out I is, Miss Kitty. Dey tells some mighty big tales, but dey makes um up dey se\u0027f. Manys en manys de time is I seed you w\u0027en you gwine atter sweet-gum en w\u0027en you huntin\u0027 flowers, en I allers say ter myse\u0027f, I did, \u0027Nobody better not pester Miss Kitty w\u0027iles Blue Dave anywhars \u0027roun\u0027.\u0027 Miss Kitty, I \u0027clar\u0027 \u0027fo\u0027 de Lord I ain\u0027t no bad nigger,\" Blue Dave continued in a tone of the most emphatic entreaty. \"You des ax yo\u0027 little br\u0027er. Little Mars. Felix, he knows I ain\u0027t no bad nigger.\" \"Why don\u0027t you go home, instead of hiding out in the woods?\" said Kitty, striving to speak in a properly indignant tone. \"Bless yo\u0027 soul, Miss Kitty, hit ain\u0027t no home fer me,\" said Blue Dave, sadly. \"Hit mought be a home fer some niggers, but hit ain\u0027t no home fer me. I year somebody comin\u0027. Good-bye, Miss Kitty; don\u0027t fergit \u0027bout Mars. George.\" As noiselessly as the wind that faintly stirs the grass, Blue Dave glided away in the darkness, leaving Kitty Kendrick standing upon the veranda half frightened and wholly puzzled. Her little brother Felix came out to see where she had gone. Felix was eight years old, and had views of his own. \"Sister Kit, what are you doing? Watching for Mr. George to go by?\" \"Don\u0027t speak to me, you naughty boy!\" exclaimed Kitty. \"You\u0027ve disgraced us all. You knew Blue Dave was hiding on top of the house all the while. What would be done with us if people found out we had been harbouring a runaway negro?\" Kitty pretended to be terribly shocked. Felix gave a long whistle, indicative of astonishment. \"You are awful smart,\" he said. \"How did you find that out? Yes, I did know it,\" he went on, desperately, \"and I don\u0027t care if I did. If you tell anybody, I\u0027ll never run up the road to see if Mr. George is coming as long as I live; I won\u0027t never do anything for you.\" Kitty\u0027s inference was based on what Blue Dave had said; but it filled her with dismay to find it true. She caught the child by the shoulder and gave him a little shake. \"Brother Felix, how dare you do such a thing? If mother knew of it, it would break her heart.\" \"Well, go and tell her and break her heart,\" said the boy, sullenly. \"It wasn\u0027t my fault that Blue Dave was up there. I didn\u0027t tote him up, I reckon.\" \"Oh, how could you do such a thing?\" reiterated Kitty, putting her handkerchief to her eyes, as if by this means to expiate her brother\u0027s folly. \"Well,\" said the child, still speaking sullenly, \"I heard something moving on top of the house one day when I was in the garret, and I kept on hearing it until I opened the window and went out on the roof. Then, when I got out there, I saw a great big nigger man.\" \"Weren\u0027t you frightened?\" exclaimed Kitty, catching her breath. \"What did you say?\" \"I said \u0027Hello!\u0027 and then he jumped like he was shot. I asked him his name, and he said he was named Blue Dave, and he begged me so hard I promised not to tell he was up there. And then, after that, he used to come in the garret and tell me no end of tales, and I\u0027ve got a trunk full of chestnuts that he brought me. He \u0027a the best nigger man I ever saw, less\u0027n it\u0027s old Uncle Manuel, and he\u0027ll be as good as Uncle Manuel when he gets that old, \u0027cause Uncle Manuel said so. And I know it ain\u0027t my fault; and if you want to tell mother you can come and tell her right now, and then you won\u0027t never be my sister any more, never, never!\" \"I think you have acted shamefully,\" said Kitty. \"Suppose he had come in the garret, and made his way down- stairs, and murdered us all while we were asleep.\" \"Well,\" said Felix, \"he could have come any time. I wouldn\u0027t be afraid to go out in the woods and stay with Blue Dave this very night, and if I had my way he wouldn\u0027t be running from old Bill Brand and his dogs. When I get a man I\u0027m going to save up money and buy Blue Dave: I thought at first I wanted a pony, but I wouldn\u0027t have a pony now.\" While they were talking, Kitty heard the rattle of buggy wheels. The sound came nearer and nearer. Whoever was driving was singing, to pass the time away, and the quick ear of Kitty recognised the voice of George Denham. He went dashing by; but he must have seen the girl standing on the veranda, for he cried out, \"Good night, Miss Kitty!\" and then caught up the burden of his song again as he went whirling down the road. Kitty wrung her hands. She went in to her mother with tears in her eyes. \"O mother! George has gone by without stopping. What shall we do?\" Mrs. Kendrick was a very practical woman. Knowing nothing of the freshet in Murder Creek, she was amazed as well as amused at Kitty\u0027s tragic attitude. \"Well, it\u0027s most too soon for George to begin to take his meals here, I reckon,\" she said dryly. \"You\u0027d better make you a cup of ginger-tea and go to bed.\" \"But, mother, there\u0027s a freshet in Murder Creek. Oh, why didn\u0027t he stop?\" Mrs. Kendrick was kneeling on the floor cutting out clothes for the plough- hands,—\"slaving for her niggers,\" as she called it. She paused in her work and looked at Kitty, as if to see whether she had heard her aright. \"Well, upon my word!\" she exclaimed, after critically surveying her daughter, \"I don\u0027t see how girls can be so weak-minded. Many a man as good as George Denham has crossed Murder Creek in a freshet. I don\u0027t see but what he\u0027s big enough and ugly enough to take care of himself.\" \"Oh,\" exclaimed Kitty, going from window to window, and vainly endeavouring to peer out into the darkness, \"why didn\u0027t he stop?\" \"Well,\" said Mrs. Kendrick, resuming the use of her shears, \"if you\u0027ll try to worry along and stand it this time, I\u0027ll send out and have a fence built across the big road, and get the niggers to light a bonfire; and we\u0027ll stop him the next time he comes along. I\u0027ll have to do my duty by my own children, I reckon. But don\u0027t be alarmed,\" she continued, perceiving that Kitty\u0027s distress was genuine. \"You may have to fly around here and get George some supper, after all. I\u0027ve been waiting on niggers all day; and even if I hadn\u0027t, I\u0027m too old and fagged out to be rushing in amongst the pots and kettles to please George Denham.\" George Denham rattled down the road, singing of \"Barbara Allen,\" but thinking of Kitty Kendrick. Suddenly his horse shied, and then he heard somebody call him. \"Mars. George! Is dat you, Mars. George?\" \"Unless you want to make a ghost of me by frightening my horse,\" exclaimed the young man, checking the animal with some difficulty. \"What do you want?\" \"Mars. George, is you see Miss Kitty w\u0027en you come by des now?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t stop. Is anything the matter?\" \"No, sir, nothin\u0027 in \u0027tickler ain\u0027t de matter, \u0027ceppin\u0027 dat Miss Kitty had sump\u0027n\u0027 ter tell you.\" \"Are you one of the Kendrick negroes?\" \"No, sir; I don\u0027t b\u0027long dar.\" \"Who are you?\" \"I \u0027clar\u0027 ter goodness, I skeer\u0027d ter tell you, Mars. George; kaze you mought fly up en git mad.\" The young man laughed with such genuine heartiness that it did the negro good to hear it. \"Well, I know who you are,\" he said; \"you are Blue Dave, and you\u0027ve come to tell me that you want me to carry you to jail, where Bill Brand can get his hands on you.\" The negro was thunderstruck. \"To\u0027 de Lord, Mars. George! how you know who I is?\" \"Why, I know by your looks. You\u0027ve got horns and a club foot. That\u0027s the way the Old Boy fixes himself.\" \"Now, Mars. George,\" said the negro in a grieved tone, \"ef you could see me good you wouldn\u0027t set dar en say I\u0027m a bad-lookin\u0027 nigger.\" \"Are you really Blue Dave?\" the young man asked, dropping his bantering tone and speaking seriously. \"Yasser, Mars. George; I\u0027m dat ve\u0027y nigger.\" \"What do you want with me?\" \"I des wanter tell you, Mars. George, dat dey\u0027s a freshet come fum \u0027bove, en Murder Creek is \u0027way out\u0027n hits banks. You can\u0027t cross dar wid no hoss en buggy dis night.\" The young man reflected a moment. He was more interested in the attitude of the negro than he was in the extent of the freshet or the danger of an attempt to cross the creek. \"I\u0027ve a knack of crossing Murder Creek in a freshet,\" he said. \"But why should you want to keep me out of it?\" \"Well, sir, fer one thing,\" said Blue Dave, shifting about on his feet uneasily, \"you look so much like my young marster w\u0027at died in Perginny. En den dat day w\u0027en de speckerlater put me up on de block, you \u0027uz settin\u0027 dar straddle er yo\u0027 pony, en you \u0027lowed dat he oughter be \u0027shame er hisse\u0027f fer ter chain me up dat a-way.\" \"Oh, I remember. I made quite a fool of myself that day.\" \"Yasser; en den w\u0027en de man say sump\u0027n\u0027 sassy back, little ez you wuz, you spurred de pony at \u0027im en tole \u0027im you\u0027d slap \u0027im in de jaw. He \u0027uz de skeer\u0027dest w\u0027ite man I ever see. I say ter myse\u0027f den dat I hope de day\u0027d come w\u0027en dat little boy\u0027d grow up en buy me; en dat make I say w\u0027at I does. I want you to keep out \u0027n dat creek dis night, en den I want you ter buy me. Please, sir, buy me, Mars. George; I make you de bes\u0027 nigger you ever had.\" \"Why, great Jerusalem! you wouldn\u0027t be on my place a week before you\u0027d get your feelings hurt and rush off to the woods, and I\u0027d never see you any more.\" \"Des try me, Mars. George! des try me. I\u0027ll work my arms off ter de elbows, en den I\u0027ll work wid de stumps. Des try me, Mars. George!\" \"I expect you would be a right good hand if you hadn\u0027t been free so long. Go home and let me see how you can work for your master, and then maybe I\u0027ll think about buying you.\" \"Eh-eh, Mars. George! I better go jump in a burnin\u0027 bresh-pile. Ain\u0027t you gwine ter tu\u0027n back, Mars. George?\" \"Not to-night. Go home and behave yourself.\" With that George Denham clucked to his restive horse, and went clattering down the road in the direction of Murder Creek, which crossed the highway a mile further on. Blue Dave stood still a moment, scratching his head and looking after the buggy. \"Is anybody ever see de beat er dat?\" he exclaimed. \"Ef Mars. George gits in dat creek, dey\u0027s got ter be a merakel come \u0027bout ef he gits out.\" He stood in the road a moment longer, still scratching his head as if puzzled. Then he addressed himself indignantly. \"Looky yer, nigger, w\u0027at you stan\u0027in\u0027 yer fer? Whar yo\u0027 manners, whar yo\u0027 perliteness?\" Thus, half—humorously, half—seriously, talking to himself, Blue Dave went trotting along in the direction taken by George Denham. He moved without apparent exertion, but with amazing swiftness. But the young man in the buggy had also moved swiftly; and, go as fast as he might, Blue Dave could not hope to overtake him before he reached the creek. For George Denham was impatient to get home,—as impatient as his horse, which did not need even the lightest touch of the whip to urge it forward. He paid no attention to the familiar road. He was thinking of pretty Kitty Kendrick, and of the day, not very far in the future, he hoped, when, in going home, he should be driving towards her instead of away from her. He paid no attention to the fact that, as he neared the creek, his horse subsided from a swinging trot to a mincing gait that betrayed indecision; nor did it strike him as anything unusual that the horse should begin to splash water with his feet long before he had reached the banks of the creek; no doubt it was a pool left standing in the road after the heavy rains. But the pool steadily grew deeper; and while George Denham was picturing Kitty Kendrick sitting on one side of his fireplace and his old mother on the other,—his old mother, with her proud face and her stately ways,—his horse stopped and looked around. Young Denham slapped the animal with the reins, without taking note of his surroundings. Thus reassured, the horse went on; but the water grew deeper and deeper, and presently the creature stopped again. This time it smelt of the water and emitted the low, deeply-drawn snort by which horses betray their uneasiness; and when George Denham would have urged it forward, it struck the water impatiently with its forefoot. Aroused by this, the young man looked around; but there was nothing to warn him of his danger. The fence that would otherwise have been a landmark was gone. There was no loud and angry roaring of the floods. Behind him the shifting clouds, the shining stars, and the blue patches of sky mirrored themselves duskily and vaguely in the slow creeping waters; before him the shadows of the trees that clustered somewhere near the banks of the creek were so deep and heavy that they seemed to merge the dark waters of the flood into the gloom of the night. When the horse was quiet, peering ahead, with its sharp little ears pointed forward, there was no sound save the vague sighing of the wind through the tops of the scrub pines and the gentle ripple of the waters. As George Denham urged his horse forward, confident of his familiarity with the surroundings, Blue Dave ran up on the little ridge to the left through which the road had been cut or worn. \"Mars. George!\" he shouted, \"don\u0027t you see wharbouts you is? Wait, Mars. George! Pull dat hoss up!\" But Blue Dave was too late. As he spoke, the horse and buggy plunged into the flood, and for a moment they were lost to view. Then the struggling animal seemed to strike rising ground; but the buggy was caught in the resistless current, and, with George Denham clinging to it, it dragged the horse down, and the swirling waters seemed to sweep over and beyond them. Blue Dave lost not a moment. Flinging himself into the flood from the vantage-ground on which he stood, a few strokes of his sinewy arms carried him to where he saw George Denham disappear. That young man was an expert swimmer; and though the sudden immersion had taken him at a disadvantage, he would have made his way out with little difficulty but for the fact that a heavy piece of driftwood had been hurled against his head. Stunned, but still conscious, he was making an ineffectual attempt to reach the shore, when he was caught by Blue Dave and borne safely back to land. The horse, in its struggles, had succeeded in tearing itself loose from the buggy, and they heard it crawl up the bank on the other side and shake itself. Blue Dave carried George Denham out of the water as one would carry a child. When he had set the young man down in a comparatively dry place, he exclaimed with a grin— \"Dar now, Mars. George! w\u0027at I tell you? Little mo\u0027 en de tarrypins would \u0027a\u0027 bin a-nibblin\u0027 atter you.\" George Denham was dazed as well as weak. He put his hand to his head and tried to laugh. \"You were just in time, old fellow,\" he said. Then he got on his feet, and tried to walk, but he would have sunk down again but for Blue Dave\u0027s arm. \"Why, I\u0027m as weak as a stray cat,\" he exclaimed, feebly. \"Let me lie down here a moment.\" \"Dat I won\u0027t, Mars. George! dat I won\u0027t! I tuck \u0027n\u0027 brung you out, en now I\u0027m a-gwineter take \u0027n\u0027 ca\u0027er you back dar whar Miss Kitty waitin\u0027.\" \"Well, you\u0027ll have to wait until I can walk.\" \"No, sir; I\u0027ll des squat down, en you kin crawl up on my back des like you useter play hoss.\" \"Why, you can\u0027t carry me, old fellow; I\u0027m too heavy for that.\" \"Shoo! don\u0027t you b\u0027leeve de half er dat, Mars. George. I toted bigger turns dan w\u0027at you is long \u0027fo\u0027 I had de strenk w\u0027at I got now. Grab me \u0027roun\u0027 de neck, Mars. George; git up little higher. Now, den, don\u0027t you be fear\u0027d er fallin\u0027.\" Blue Dave rose from his stooping posture, steadied himself a moment, and then moved on with his living burden. He moved slowly and cautiously at first, but gradually increased his pace to a swinging walk that carried him forward with surprising swiftness. To George Denham it all seemed like a dream. He suffered no pain, and it was with a sort of queer elation of mind that he felt the huge muscles of the negro swell and subside under him with the regularity of machinery, and knew that every movement carried him toward Kitty Kendrick and rest. He was strangely tired, but not otherwise uncomfortable. He felt abundantly grateful to this poor runaway negro, and thought that if he could overcome his mother\u0027s prejudices (she had a horror of runaway negroes) he would buy Blue Dave and make him comfortable. Thus they swung along until the negro\u0027s swift stride brought them to Mrs. Kendrick\u0027s gate. There Blue Dave deposited George Denham, and exclaimed with a laugh as he leaned against the fence— \"You\u0027er right smart chunk er meat, Mars. George, ez sho ez de worl\u0027!\" George Denham also leaned against the fence, but he didn\u0027t laugh. He was thinking of what seemed to him a very serious matter. \"Mother will be frightened to death when that horse gets home,\" he said. \"You go in dar en get worn, Mars. George,\" said Blue Dave. \"I\u0027m gwine \u0027roun\u0027 by de High Bridge en tell um whar you is.\" \"Why, you\u0027ll break yourself down,\" said George Deuham. \"Ah, Lord, Mars. George!\" said the negro, laughing, \"time you bin in de woods long ez I is de four mile \u0027twix\u0027 yer en yo\u0027 house\u0027ll look mighty short. Go in dar, Mars. George, \u0027fo\u0027 you git col\u0027!\" Shortly after this, George Denham was in bed and fast asleep. He had been met at the door by Kitty Kendrick, in whose telltale face the blushes of that heartiest of all welcomes had chased away the pallor of dread and anxiety. Mrs. Kendrick was less sympathetic in word than in deed. She had known George Denham since he was a little boy in short clothes; and while she approved of him, and had a sort of motherly affection for him, she was disposed to be critical, as are most women who have the knack of management. \"And so you\u0027ve come back dripping, have you? Well, you ain\u0027t the first head-strong, high-strung chap that\u0027s found out water is wet when the creek blots out the big road, I reckon. I\u0027m no duck myself. When I see water, I\u0027m like the old cat in the corner; I always feel like shaking my foot. Kitty, call Bob and tell him to make a fire in the big room. He\u0027s asleep, I reckon, and you\u0027ll have to holler. Set a nigger down and he\u0027s snoring directly. You look pale,\" Mrs. Kendrick continued, turning to George. \"You must have gone in over your ears. I should think a drenching like that would take all the conceit out of a man.\" \"Well, it has taken it all out of me, ma\u0027am,\" said George, laughing. Then the young man told Mrs. Kendrick of his misadventure, and of the part Blue Dave had borne in it. \"He\u0027s the nigger that roosted on top of my house,\" said Mrs. Felix, bustling around and putting a kettle of water on the fire. \"Well, it\u0027s a roundabout way to pay for his lodging, but it\u0027s the best he could do, I reckon. Now, don\u0027t you worry yourself, George; in ten minutes you\u0027ll be snug in bed, and then you\u0027ll drink a cup of composition tea, and to-morrow morning you\u0027ll have forgotten all about trying to make a spring branch out of Murder Creek.\" As the successful mistress of a household, Mrs. Kendrick knew precisely what was necessary to be done. There was no hitch in her system, no delay in her methods, and no disputing her remedies. George Denham was ordered to bed as if he had been a child; and though the \"composition\" tea was hot in the month and bitter to the palate, it was useless to protest against it. As a consequence of all this, the young man was soon in the land of dreams. When everything was quiet, Kitty prepared a very substantial lunch. Then, calling her little brother Felix, she went across the yard to the quarters, and stopped at Uncle Manuel\u0027s cabin. The door was ajar, and Kitty could see the venerable old negro nodding before the flickering embers. She went in and called his name— \"Uncle Manuel!\" \"Eh! Who dat?\" Then, looking around and perceiving Kitty, the old negro\u0027s weather-beaten face shone with a broad smile of surprise and welcome. \"Why, honey! Why, little Mistiss! How come dis? You makes de ole nigger feel proud; dat you does. I fear\u0027d ter ax you ter set down, honey, de cheer so rickety.\" \"Uncle Manuel,\" said Kitty, \"do you know Blue Dave?\" Uncle Manuel was old, and wise, and cunning. He hesitated a moment before replying, and even then his caution would not allow him to commit himself. \"Blue Dave, he\u0027s dat ar runaway nigger, ain\u0027t he, honey? I done year talk un \u0027im lots er times.\" \"Well,\" said Kitty, placing her basket upon Uncle Manuel\u0027s tool-chest, \"here is something for Blue Dave to eat. If you don\u0027t see him yourself, perhaps you can send it to him by some one.\" Uncle Manuel picked up the basket, weighed it in his hand, and then placed it on the chest again. Then he looked curiously at Kitty, and said— \"Honey, how come you gwine do dis? Ain\u0027t you year tell hit\u0027s ag\u0027in de law fer ter feed a runaway nigger?\" Kitty blushed as she thought of George Denham. \"I send Blue Dave the victuals because I choose to, Uncle Manuel,\" she said. \"The law has nothing to do with that little basket.\" She started to go, but Uncle Manuel raised both hands heavenwards. \"Wait, little Mistiss,\" he cried, the tears running down his furrowed face; \"des wait, little Mistiss. \u0027Twou\u0027t hurt you, honey. De ole nigger wuz des gwine ter git down ter his pra\u0027rs \u0027fo\u0027 you come in. Dey ain\u0027t no riper time dan dis.\" Uncle Manuel\u0027s voice was husky with suppressed emotion. With his hands still stretched toward the skies, and the tears still running down his face, he fell upon his knees and exclaimed— \"Saviour en Marster er de worl\u0027! draw nigh dis night en look down into dis ole nigger\u0027s heart; lissen ter de humblest er de humble. Blessed Marster! some run wild eh some go stray, some go hether en some go yan\u0027; but all un um mus\u0027 go befo\u0027 dy mercy-seat in de een\u0027. Some\u0027ll fetch big works, en some\u0027ll fetch great deeds, but po\u0027 ole Manuel won\u0027t fetch nothiu\u0027 but one weak, sinful heart. Dear, blessed Marster! look in dat heart en see w\u0027at in dar. De sin dat\u0027s dar, Lord, blot it out wid dy wounded han\u0027. Dear Marster, bless my little Mistiss. Her comin\u0027s en her gwines is des like one er dy angels er mercy; she scatters bread en meat \u0027mongs\u0027 dem w\u0027at\u0027s lonesome in der ways, en dem w\u0027at runs up en down in de middle er big tribalation. Saviour! Marster! look down \u0027pon my little Mistiss; gedder her \u0027nead dy hev\u0027mly wings. Ef trouble mus\u0027 come, let it come \u0027pon me. I\u0027m ole, but I\u0027m tough; I\u0027m ole, but I got de strenk. Lord! let de troubles en de trials come \u0027pon de ole nigger w\u0027at kin stan\u0027 um, en save my little Mistiss fum sheddin\u0027 one tear. En den, at de las\u0027 fetch us all home ter hev\u0027m, whar dey\u0027s res\u0027 fer de w\u0027ary. Amen.\" Never in her life before had Kitty felt so thrilling a sense of nearness to her Creator as when Uncle Manuel was offering up his simple prayer; and she went out of the humble cabin weeping gently. III. THE four-mile run to the Denham Plantation was fun for Blue Dave. He was wet and cold, and the exercise acted as a lively invigorant. Once, as he sped along, he was challenged by the patrol; but he disappeared like a shadow, and came into the road again a mile away, singing to himself— Run, nigger, run! patter-roller ketch you; Run, nigger, run! hit\u0027s almos\u0027 day! He was well acquainted with the surroundings at the Denham Plantation, having been fed many a time by the well-cared-for negroes; and he had no hesitation in approaching the premises. The clouds had whirled themselves away, and the stars told him it was ten o\u0027clock. There was a light in the sitting-room, and Blue Dave judged it best to go to the back door. He rapped gently, and then a little louder. Ordinarily the door would have been opened by the trim black housemaid; but to-night it was opened by George Denham\u0027s mother, a prim old lady of whom everybody stood greatly in awe without precisely knowing why. She looked out, and saw the gigantic negro looming up on the doorsteps. \"Do you bring news of my son?\" she asked. The voice was low, but penetrating; and the calm, even tones told the story of a will too strong to tolerate opposition, or even contradiction. Blue Dave hesitated out of sheer embarrassment at finding such cool serenity where he had probably expected to find grief or some such excitement. \"Did you hear me speak?\" the prim old lady asked, before the negro had time to gather his wits. \"Do you bring me news of my son?\" \"Yessum,\" said Blue Dave, scratching his head; \"dat w\u0027at I come fer. Mars. George gwine ter stay at de Kendrick Place ter-night. I speck he in bed by dis time,\" he added, reassuringly. \"His horse has come home without buggy or harness. Is my son hurt? Don\u0027t be afraid to tell me the truth. What has happened to him?\" How could the poor negro—how could anybody—know what a whirlwind of yearning affection, dread, and anxiety was raging behind these cool, level tones? \"Mistiss, I tell you de trufe: Mars. George is sorter hurted, but he ain\u0027t hurted much. I met \u0027im in de road, en I tuck \u0027n\u0027 tole \u0027im dey wuz a freshet in Murder Creek; but he des laugh at me, en he driv\u0027 in des like dey wa\u0027n\u0027t no water dar; en den w\u0027en he make his disappearance, I tuck \u0027n\u0027 splunge in atter \u0027im, en none too soon, n\u0027er, kaze he got strucken on de head wid a log, an w\u0027en I fotch \u0027im out, he \u0027uz all dazzle up like. Yit he ain\u0027t hurted much, Mistiss.\" \"What is your name?\" the prim old lady asked. \"Blue Dave, ma\u0027am.\" \"The runaway?\" The negro hesitated, looked around, and then hung down his head. He knew the calm, fearless eyes of this gentlewoman were upon him; he felt the influence of her firm tones. She repeated her question— \"Are you Blue Dave, the runaway?\" \"Yessum.\" The answer seemed to satisfy the lady. She turned and called Eliza, the housemaid. \"Eliza, your master\u0027s supper is in the dining-room by the fire. Here are the keys. Take it into the kitchen.\" Then she turned to Blue Dave. \"David,\" she said, \"go into the kitchen and eat your supper.\" Then Eliza was sent after Ellick, the negro foreman; and Ellick was not long in finding Blue Dave a suit of linsey-woolsey clothes, a little warmer and a little drier than those the runaway was in the habit of wearing. Then the big greys were put to the Denham carriage, shawls and blankets were thrown in, and Blue Dave was called. \"Have you had your supper, David?\" said Mrs. Denham, looking grimmer than ever as she stood on her veranda arrayed in bonnet and wraps. \"Thanky, Mistiss! thanky, ma\u0027am. I ain\u0027t had no meal\u0027s vittles like dat, not gence I lef Ferginny.\" \"Can you drive a carriage, David?\" the old lady asked. \"Dat I kin, Mistiss.\" Whereupon he seized the reins and let down the carriage steps. Mrs. Denham and her maid got in; but when everything was ready, Blue Dave hesitated. \"Mistiss,\" he said, rather sheepishly, \"w\u0027en I come \u0027long des now, de patter-rollers holler\u0027d atter me.\" \"No matter, David,\" the grim old lady replied; \"your own master wouldn\u0027t order you off of my carriage.\" \"Keep yo\u0027 eye on dat off boss!\" exclaimed Ellick, as the carriage moved off. \"Hush, honey,\" Blue Dave cried, as exultantly as a child; \"\u0027fo\u0027 dey gits ter de big gate, I\u0027ll know deze yer bosses better dan ef dey wuz my br\u0027er.\" After that, nothing more was said. The road had been made firm and smooth by the heavy beating rain, and the carriage swung along easily and rapidly. The negro housemaid fell back against the cushions, and was soon sound asleep; but Mrs. Denham sat bolt upright. Hers was an uncompromising nature, it had been said, and certainly it seemed so; but as the carriage rolled along, there grew before her mind\u0027s eye the vague, dim outlines of a vision,—a vision of a human creature hiding in the dark swamps, fleeing through the deep woods, and creeping swiftly through the pine thickets. It was a pathetic figure, this fleeing human creature, whether chased by dogs and men or pursued only by the terrors that hide themselves behind the vast shadows of the night; and the figure grew more pathetic when, as it seemed, it sprang out of the very elements themselves to snatch her son from the floods. The old lady sighed and pressed her thin lips together. She had made up her mind. Presently the carriage drew up at the Kendrick Place; and in a little while, after effusive greetings all around, Mrs. Denham was sitting at Mrs. Kendrick\u0027s hearth listening to the story of her son\u0027s rescue. She wanted to go in and see George at once, but Mrs. Kendrick would consent only on condition that he was not to be aroused. \"It is foolish to say it,\" said the old lady, smiling at Kitty as she came out of the room in which her son was sleeping; \"but my son seems to look to-night just as he did when a baby.\" Kitty smiled such a responsive smile, and looked so young and beautiful, that the proud old lady stooped and kissed her. \"I think I shall love you, my dear.\" \"I reckon I\u0027ll have to get even with you,\" said Mrs. Kendrick, who had a knack of hiding her own emotion, \"by telling George that I\u0027ve fallen in love with him.\" This gave a light and half-humorous turn to affairs, and in a moment Mrs. Denham was as prim and as uncompromising in appearance as ever. \"Well!\" exclaimed Mrs. Kendrick, after she and Kitty had retired for the night, \"the day\u0027s worth living if only to find out that Rebecca Denham has got a heart in her insides. I believe actually she\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 cried for a little.\" \"She did cry, mother,\" said Kitty, solemnly. \"There were tears in her eyes when she leaned over me.\" \"Well, well, well!\" said Mrs. Kendrick, \"she always put me in mind of a ghost that can\u0027t be laid on account of its pride. But we\u0027re what the Lord made us, I reckon, and people deceive their looks. My old turkey gobbler is harmless as a hound puppy; but I reckon he\u0027d bust if he didn\u0027t up and strut when strangers are in the front porch.\" With that Mrs. Kendrick addressed herself to her prayers and to slumber; but Kitty lay awake a long time, thinking and thinking, until finally her thoughts became the substance of youth\u0027s sweetest dreams. IV. BUT why should the tender dreams of this pure heart be transcribed here? Indeed, why should these vague outlines be spun out to the vanishing- point, like the gossamer threads that float and glance and disappear in the September skies? Some of the grandchildren of George Denham and Kitty Kendrick will read these pages, and wonder, romantic youngsters that they are, why all the love passages have been suppressed; other readers, more practical, and perhaps severer, will ask themselves what possible interest there can be in the narrative of a simple episode in the life of a humble fugitive. What reply can be made, what explanation can be offered? Fortunately, what remains to be told may mostly be put in the sententious language of Brother Johnny Roach. One day, shortly after the events which have been described, Brother Branuum rode up to Brother Roach\u0027s mill, dismounted, and hitched his horse to the rack. \"You\u0027re mighty welcome, Brother Brannum,\" said Brother Roach from the door, as cheerful under his covering of meal dust as the clown in the pantomime; \"you\u0027re mighty welcome. I had as lief talk to my hopper as to most folks; but the hopper knows me by heart, and I dassent take too many liberties wi\u0027 it. Come in, Brother Brannum; there\u0027s no great head of water on, and the gear is running soberly. Sat\u0027days, when all the rocks are moving, my mill is a female woman; the clatter is turrible. I\u0027ll not deny it. I hope you\u0027re well, Brother Brannum. And Sister Brannum. I\u0027ll never forgit the savour of her Sunday dumplings, not if I live a thousand year.\" \"We\u0027re well as common, Brother Roach, well as common. Yit a twitch here and a twinge there tells us we\u0027re moving along to\u0027rds eternity. It\u0027s age that\u0027s a-feeling of us, Brother Roach; and when we\u0027re ripe it\u0027ll pluck us.\" \"It\u0027s age rutherthan the dumplings, that I\u0027ll take the stand on,\" exclaimed Brother Roach. \"Yit, when it comes to that, look at Mizzers Denham; that woman kin look age out of countenance any day. Then there\u0027s Giner\u0027l Bledser; who more nimble at a muster than the Giner\u0027l? I see \u0027era both this last gone Sat\u0027day, and though I was in- about up to my eyes in the toll-bin, I relished the seeing and the hearing of \u0027em. But I reckon you\u0027ve heard the news, Brother Brannum,\" said Brother Roach, modestly deprecating his own sources of information. \"Bless you! Not me, Brother Roach,\" said Brother Brannum; \"I\u0027ve heard no news. Down in my settlement I\u0027m cut off from the world. Let them caper as they may, we\u0027re not pestered wi\u0027 misinformation.\" \"No, nor me nuther, Brother Brannum,\" said Brother Roach, \"bekaze it\u0027s as much as I can do for to listen at the racket of my mill. Yit there are some sights meal dust won\u0027t begin to hide, and some talk the clatter of the hopper won\u0027t nigh drown.\" \"What might they be, Brother Roach?\" Brother Brannum brushed the dust off a box with his coat-tails, and sat down. \"Well, sir,\" said Brother Roach, pushing his hat back, and placing his thumbs behind his suspenders, \"last Sat\u0027day gone I was a-hurrying to and fro, when who should pop in at the door but Giner\u0027l Bledser? \"\u0027Hello, Johnny!\u0027 says he, free and familiar. \"\u0027Howdy, Giner\u0027l,\u0027 says I. \u0027You look holp up, speaking off-hand,\u0027 says I. \"\u0027That I am, Johnny, that I am,\u0027 says he; \u0027I\u0027ve made a trade that makes me particular proud,\u0027 says he. \"\u0027How\u0027s that, Giner\u0027l?\u0027 says I. \"\u0027Why, I\u0027ve sold Blue Dave,\u0027 says he; \u0027eight year ago, I bought him for five hundred dollars, and now I\u0027ve sold him to Mizzerg Denham for a thousand,\u0027 says he. \u0027I\u0027ve got the cold cash in my pocket, and now let \u0027em ketch the nigger,\u0027 says he. \"\u0027Well, Giner\u0027l,\u0027 says I, \u0027it\u0027ll be time for to marvel arter you seethe outcome, bekaze,\u0027 says I, \u0027when there\u0027s business in the wind, Mizzers Denham is as long-headed and as cle\u0027r-sighted as a Philedelphia lawyer,\u0027 says I. \"And (would you believe it, Brother Brannum?) the outcome happened then and there right before our very face and eyes.\" \"In what regards, Brother Roach?\" said Brother Brannum, rubbing his bony hands together. \"Well, sir, I glanced my eye out of the door, and I see the Denham carriage coming down yan hill. I p\u0027inted it out to the Giner\u0027l, and he ups and says, says he— \"\u0027Davy, though she may be a-going to town for to sue me for damages, yit, if Mizzers Denham\u0027s in that carriage, I\u0027ll salute her now,\u0027 says he; and then he took his stand in the door, as frisky as a colt and as smiling as a basket of chips. As they come up, I tetch\u0027d the Giner\u0027l on the shoulder. \"\u0027Giner\u0027l,\u0027 says I, \u0027look clost at that nigger on the carriage,—look clost at him,\u0027 says I. \"\u0027Why, what the thunderation!\u0027 says he. \"\u0027To be certain!\u0027 says I; \u0027that\u0027s your Blue Dave, and he looks mighty slick,\u0027 says I. \"The Giner\u0027l forgot for to say howdy,\" continued Brother Roach, laughing until he began to wheeze; \"but Mizaers Denham, she leant out of the carriage window, and said, says she— \"\u0027Good morning, Giner\u0027l, good morning I David is a most excellent driver,\u0027 says she. \"The Giner\u0027l managed for to take off his hat, but he was in-about the worst-whipped-out white man I ever see. And arter the carriage got out of hearing, sir, he stood in that there door there and cussed plump tell he couldn\u0027t cuss. When a man\u0027s been to Congress and back, he\u0027s liable for to know how to take the name of the Lord in vain. But don\u0027t tell me about the wimmen, Brother Brannum. Don\u0027t!\" Blue Dave was happy at last. He became a great favourite with everybody. His voice was the loudest at the corn-shucking, his foot was the nimblest at the plantation frolics, his row was the straightest and the cleanest in the cotton-patch, his hand was the firmest on the carriage-seat, his arm was the strongest at the log-rolling. When his old mistress came to die, her wandering mind dwelt upon the negro who had served her so faithfully. She fancied she was making a journey. \"The carriage goes smoothly along here,\" she said. Then, after a little pause, she asked, \"Is David driving?\" and the weeping negro cried out from a corner of the room— \"\u0027Tain\u0027t po\u0027 Dave, Mistiss! De good Lord done tuck holt er de lines.\" And so, dreaming as a little child would dream, the old lady slipped from life into the beatitudes, if the smiles of the dead mean anything.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2807/77580.html","bookId":506,"book":{"id":506,"title":"Mingo And Other Sketches in Black and White","description":"简介： IN 1876, circumstances, partly accidental and partly sentimental, led me to revisit Crooked Creek Church, near the little village of Rockville, in Middle Georgia.
