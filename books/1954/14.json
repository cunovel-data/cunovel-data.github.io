A slight sheen of sweat spread across my skin as my balls drew up tight ready to shoot off like a rocket, when I felt the beginnings of her second orgasm. “Mace, oh God, fuck, harder! Fuck me harder!” she yelled out.\\n\\n I flipped her to her back and drove in hard and fast. “Fucking love your hot little cunt, babe. Gonna come in you.”\\n\\n “Mace!” she screamed my name as her tight body clamped down on me. Her orgasm ripping through her body, back arched up, she was fucking perfect.\\n\\n “Urrgh, Fuckkk!” I bellowed as I emptied myself into her still contracting core.\\n\\n I collapsed down onto her, holding myself up slightly, my face buried in the crook of her neck. Breathing heavily, I gradually came down from the most explosive sex of my life. I realized it was different this time; the sex was out of this world, but there was more of a connection there. Something in me clicked into place, and I was no longer just pretty fucking certain, I was without a doubt, completely fucking sure, I was in love with Scarlett.\\n\\n Chapter Fifteen\\n\\n The last of my walls came crashing down around us. There was no point fighting it anymore; it was useless. Regardless of my efforts in keeping feelings out of it, I had to go and be stupid enough to fall in love. Love only leads to heartbreak; I’d seen it on more than one occasion and felt it myself. I just had to hope to hell that Mace was careful with my scarred heart.\\n\\n Still hovering over me, he lifted his head, rising up slightly on his arms. He peered down at me, a look in his eyes that told me his emotional state wasn’t so far off mine. My eyes travelled down his sexy ripped body. Mace’s skill was outta this world, insane good. I’d never had a partner who knew exactly how to touch me. Every single time was crazy-extreme, hot-as-hell sex. Even when it was slow and sweet, it was still intense. He’d taken everything I thought I knew about men and shifted it on its axis. The way he could drive me from mad as hell to sweet and soft, then straight into animalistic need, blew me away.\\n\\n Lying there with Mace encasing me, felt good. Mix that with thinking about said skill and the fact he was still half hard inside me, my body kicked into gear again. I was more than content to stay in bed with him all day, but I had appointments. Looking over at the clock, I realized there were still a few hours to get to the shop. I lifted my head and licked at his nipple; the shining metal barbell provided too much temptation, and I knew the effect it had on most people. I wasn’t disappointed when I flicked it a few more times and pulled gently with my teeth. Mace groaned, the vibrations sending a wave of arousal through me. One more little tug and he was as hard as nails again. I proceeded to make good use of his generous reaction until it was time to get out of bed and get to work.\\n\\n I was getting pissy at myself. All day, my thoughts were constantly drifting to Mace. I was being a girl. I hated being girly—all those weird things they do, like mooning over dudes, yeah, that really wasn’t me. I kinda hated how much I loved him; it was a bit sickening. But I was really looking forward to tonight, drinks, shooting some pool at Bob’s. I was still limiting myself though; I didn’t ever plan on puking all over Mace again, or anyone else for that matter.\\n\\n Closing time couldn’t come quick enough, especially for the fact my day consisted of one tattoo and four piercings, one of which was on a smelly guy’s junk, not at all pleasant, and a chick who literally came when her nipples were done. Twice. One orgasm for each nipple; it was awkward to say the least.\\n\\n Once the store was locked up, I made my way to the bar. My baby rumbling under my ass, the engine purring as I pulled up out the front, I saw Mace waiting for me by the front doors. I needed to put time aside to bathe her and give her some attention, before she started feeling neglected. I fucking loved my car. Before I even had my hand on the door, Mace appeared. He reached in and pulled me out. Taking me by surprise, he pushed me back against the door, hands on my ass and laid a scorching-hot wet kiss on me. Before I even realized it, we were full on making out against my car. Mace lifted his head and rather than saying hello he said in that low deep raspy voice, “Gonna fuck you hard over the hood of that car, babe.”\\n\\n That idea sounded more than good, and I was so damn turned on I was about ready to make it happen right there in the public parking lot. God, Mace had me hooked. I couldn’t get enough of him.\\n\\n He helped right my clothes, taking a moment to get ourselves under control. Then we made for the front doors of Bob’s. Taking in the fairly packed bar, I spotted Teeny, Trip, Remy and Mace’s best friend Jude gathered around by the pool tables. As we made it closer, the tension was palpable from Teen and Trip mostly. It occurred to me, I’d been so wrapped up in Mace, literally and figuratively, that Teen and I hadn’t spent a lot of time together. I had been a shitty-ass best friend.\\n\\n I did know something was going on with the two of them. She’d let it slip over drinks a few weeks back. Time to find out exactly what the hell was going on there. Not one for beating around the bush, I came straight out with it. “What the fuck’s goin’ on between you two?” A look of guilt crossed Teeny’s face. Trip looked down at his overly-interesting boots and Mace choked down a laugh behind me. “Out with it then, don’t fuck with me.”\\n\\n Trip looked up and I pinned him with a look that said I was far from screwing around. “Nothin’, we’re good. S’all good, right, Teen?” Trip mumbled without looking her way.\\n\\n “Oh, we’re mother-fuckin peachy, honey,” she replied in a fake peppy voice, glaring daggers at the back of his head before stomping off toward the restrooms, shoulder barging him on the way past.\\n\\n Oh shit. I squeezed Mace’s hand that was wrapped around my hip and took off after her. Teeny wasn’t one for drama, so this had to be something serious.\\n\\n “Teen, babe, what’s up?” I asked when I found her standing by the sink washing her face.\\n\\n “I’m fine, Scar. Really, I’m okay.”\\n\\n “What? You are so full of shit, but fine. You don’t wanna talk about it now? We won’t, but you will. Soon. Tomorrow night, girls’ night at your place, right?” She looked up at me put on a forced smile and nodded. “Let’s go get you a strong drink then.” I grabbed her and drew her in for a hug\\n\\n “I’ll pass on the drink. I’m not feeling great.” Thinking nothing of it, we left the restrooms and made our way back to the guys.\\n\\n An hour later, I was slightly buzzed sitting in the booth beside Mace. Jude had left a while ago having to get home to his eight-year-old twin boys, Jordan and Jaxson; their mother had ditched them and ran off with Jude’s boss when they were just four. I had a world of respect for Jude being a single father; he clearly loved his boys and would do anything for them. The chatter from the table was mostly between Mace, Remy and Trip. Teeny was unusually quiet and I was too busy jumping between watching her and trying to ignore Mace’s wandering hand.\\n\\n His large hand sitting at the edge of my skirt started its path again, slowly creeping up my inner thigh to the edge of my drenched panties; a small rub then it was gone again. His calloused fingers against the smooth skin of my legs were driving me mad. I knew what he was up to though, this was payback for the theatrics I’d pulled at his welcome home dinner. It was his turn getting me back. But I had other plans; I wasn’t about to let him win. The next time his hand crept up, I reached down and showed him just what he was doing to me. I slid his index finger through my wet slit and had to bite my lip so as not to laugh or groan at the tortured sound that came from his throat. Smirking to myself, I let go. I had expected he’d move his hand and leave it be.\\n\\n I was wrong.\\n\\n Oh, fucking hell!\\n\\n Mace’s long thick finger entered me in one quick slide, before he pulled out and did it again, sending the throb in my core into over drive. Why the hell did I never come out on top? He always one upped me. His finger continued slipping in and out as he added a thumb to the mix, rolling it over my clit in slow torturous circles, flicking every few rotations at my piercing. God, help me! I was going to come at the table across from my friends in a jam packed bar. I should have been mortified, but all I felt was turned on and a little naughty.\\n\\n I was trying hard to control my reaction, but the fact Mace was fingering me while having a normal conversation sent red hot need flowing through me. It was all I could do not to moan. The moment my hips started involuntarily shifting, Mace stopped moving, his fingers still planted deep inside me, the heel of his large palm against my mound. He tilted his head down to mine and through gritted teeth whispered, “You want me to make you come right here in front of everyone, or you want me to take you over the restroom sink and fuck you dirty, babe?”\\n\\n My breath caught. I loved when he spoke like that. The way his voice had dropped to almost a growl, told me if I reached over, I’d find him hard, throbbing and waiting. “Bathroom. Right fucking now,” I whimpered, biting his ear lobe.\\n\\n He pulled his hand from under my tiny skirt, all but picked me up and made for the rest rooms, which we found to be all in use with long lines. I was about ready to pull a few bitches out of the way by their crappy hair extensions. “This way,” Mace started walking swiftly toward the back of the bar; clearly, he was in just as much of a hurry as I was.\\n\\n He pushed through the back door and into the dimly lit alley. Looking around, there was nobody in sight. Quickly, he pinned me to the brick wall, lifted me up, his arms under my legs, hands holding my ass, spreading me open. The warm night air gave no relief to the heat coming from my flushed skin. At the perfect height, I reached down to his jean-clad erection, running my hand over him. A deep moan vibrated against my skin where he was nipping and kissing my neck. I released his angry, rock-solid hard-on from his jeans, lining him up at my entrance. Before I could do anything more than marvel at the feel of him heavy in my hand, he thrust his hips forward violently, driving into my slick pussy.\\n\\n Fuck me!\\n\\n Mace pounded into me, hitting all the right spots, my back rubbing on the abrasive brick wall, his hands kneading my ass. All the touching and torture at the table meant that I was so close to losing it. A moan ripped up from my throat as he grabbed the back of my head. His hand fisting in my hair, he pulled, exposing my neck. The slight stinging at the roots of my hair sent a throb directly to my clit making me gasp.\\n\\n “Fuck, babe, you feel so fucking good, all the damn time. Watchin’ you tryin’ not to come on my hand, knowin’ what I was doin’ to you while everyone was around. God! Fuck! I need you!” At his raw words, my orgasm tore through me, my back arching. “Oh, shit, Mace, I—holy fuck!” I yelled out, seconds before he pumped hard into me one final time. On a roar, he stilled and spilt himself deep in my still contracting muscles.\\n\\n Panting and shaking, I rested my head on his shoulder as he pulled out and zipped up. His come ran down my thighs as I righted my skirt. I could only imagine what my hair looked like; that and the flush of my skin would make it clear what we had been up to.\\n\\n Mace stopped us at the door before going back inside. He leaned down and gave me a slow but no less scorching kiss, leaving me as per usual breathless. Pulling back, he slapped me on the ass as I headed toward our table while he went to grab everyone another round from the bar. Trip looked from me to Mace then back to me again, a smirk on his face as he asked, “What were you doin’ out the back?” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tattered-love-needle-s-kiss-1/page-14.html","bookId":1954,"book":{"id":1954,"title":"Tattered Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #1)","description":"Storyline: Tattered Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #1) \\n When ex-Special Ops bad-ass Mace walks into Needle\u0027s Kiss tattoo parlour, he never expected to find the girl who would turn his life upside down. \\n Hard as nails Scarlett has been unlucky in love: she’s been burnt, chewed up and spat out.
