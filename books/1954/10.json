I walked inside, right through the kitchen and took the stairs two at a time. Turning into the bathroom, I closed and locked the door. I deposited Scarlett on the bathroom counter, one hand sliding up her dress and along her thigh while the other went behind her neck bringing her mouth to mine.\\n\\n “That was fucking hot, babe,” I growled, my lips moving over her neck. Scarlett stilled for a moment before she attacked me with her hands, mouth and teeth.\\n\\n Nipping, licking and teasing, her lips traveled down over me with a need that rivalled mine. I ripped her soaked dress up and over her head, leaving her sitting in nothing but a pair of tiny bikini bottoms tied at the sides with string, her perfect tits moving with her deep uneven breaths, and hard nipples begging to be sucked. Leaning down, I nipped at her left nipple; she arched back, pushing her chest into my mouth with a whimper. My cock twitched when her fingers dug into my hair, holding my head against her heaving chest.\\n\\n Next thing I knew, she’d slid off the counter, and right to the floor on her knees in front of me. She pulled my shorts down around my feet, licked her full lips and wrapped her delicate soft hands around my cock. She smiled up at me, and I damn near lost it right there. “Fuck me,” I groaned when her warm tongue flicked at the head of my rock-hard dick. I balled my hands into fists; the sight of my throbbing cock sliding in and out of her mouth had my balls drawing painfully tight as the base of my spine started to tingle. The soft vibration as she moaned went right through me. Watching her enjoy sucking me off, I saw as she slipped her hand down to pleasure herself. I could just make out her flicking her finger over the tiny gold ring at her clit, the sight almost made me cum in her mouth. I gripped under her shoulders and hefted her up onto the sink, ripped those bikini pants off and plunged in deep and fast, tearing a loud groan from both of us. “Fuck, so tight.”\\n\\n Shit, she felt good. It must have been the heat of the moment, but I felt every inch of her velvet soft heat like I hadn’t before. I gripped her hips tight and kept up a steady rhythm. Scarlett threw her head back, scraped her nails down my back and demanded, “More. Harder, Mace. Oh, God, yes. Oh!”\\n\\n Her pussy clamped onto my strained cock when she screamed out, her mouth slightly parted, “I’m gonna come”.\\n\\n “Fuck, yes, babe. Give it to me.” I drove into her, my cock jerking as I came deep.\\n\\n When the shockwaves died down and my breathing returned to something close to normal, I started to pull out and stilled, my body locked up tight, panic ripping through me.\\n\\n Fuck, shit, fuck.\\n\\n “Babe, tell me you’re on the pill or something.” I looked up to Scarlett’s slightly dazed face. “Babe?” I prompted. “We didn’t use a rubber.”\\n\\n Chapter Ten\\n\\n We didn’t use a rubber? What?\\n\\n It took a moment for Mace’s words to register.\\n\\n I swallowed hard and answered softly, “We’re good. I’m on the pill.” The second those words left my mouth, he physically relaxed. The last thing either of us needed was a scare like that.\\n\\n Fuck.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d let go so much that I hadn\u0027t used protection. What the fuck was I thinking? Yes, I was on the pill, but that didn\u0027t stop any of the other shit from possibly happening. I took a deep breath, and tried to think rationally. Did I really think there was a chance of me getting some fucked up disease from Mace? No. He\u0027d only just returned from a celibate life in the military. I wouldn\u0027t have let his dick anywhere near my vajayjay if I\u0027d have thought he was rancid.\\n\\n He must have read my face, because before I even opened my mouth to ask, he smirked at me. “I’m clean. You’re on the pill, and if you weren’t clean, I assume you would have said something before now?”\\n\\n Fuck me. Apparently, not only was I an easy lay when it came to all things Mace, but I was pretty darn easy to read too. I really needed to work on my poker face.\\n\\n He paused a moment before capturing my face. Cupping both cheeks, he leaned in close, “I’ve had you bare now, babe. Not goin’ back.”\\n\\n I wanted to argue simply because he assumed I was okay with that, but I was okay with that, more than okay with that. Shit, he was getting to me. I liked Mace more than I should; he was getting under my skin. No feelings, Scarlett, I reminded myself.\\n\\n God damn it!\\n\\n I looked at my surroundings and realized we were in his mother’s bathroom.\\n\\n Oh dear God!\\n\\n He’d carried me up here. I doubted anyone hadn’t known why we had been gone so long. I jumped down off the counter and started getting dressed.\\n\\n I whisper-hissed, “Mace, we’re in your mother’s bathroom. We just had sex in your mother’s bathroom. With your family downstairs.” I felt like gagging. I couldn’t decide if I was simply angry or panicking, maybe a little of both.\\n\\n “They were occupied with that asshole. Think you broke his nose.” He picked up my hand that was throbbing and looked a little red. “Your hand okay? You’ll need some ice on that.”\\n\\n The anger and panic slid away the moment the concerned expression hit his face. “It’s fine just a little tender.”\\n\\n “Where’d you learn to hit like that?” Mace asked, running his thumb softly across my knuckles.\\n\\n His sweetness was messing with my head. I needed some space and pronto. Pulling my hand away, I started for the door “My dad, he always said a girl should know how to defend herself. Guess now I know why.”\\n\\n Mace was dangerous to me. Not just because he threatened to tear away at all the protective measures I’d taken to ensure nobody ever took me for a fool again, but because I wanted him, like I hadn’t wanted anyone before him, and it was scaring the crap out of me.\\n\\n I excused myself and went back downstairs. Teeny was lounging by the pool, all signs of drama gone. “Teen, I’m having a God damn crisis,” I muttered heatedly under my breath.\\n\\n Plonking down into the empty lounger beside her, she looked over the top of her sunglasses at me and smiled big. “Dunno what kinda crisis that is, but if the flush in your cheeks and your just-fucked hair is anything to go by, I’ll take a few crises for myself thanks”.\\n\\n “You’re supposed to be helping me here. What the fuck am I doing? It was supposed to be sex—plain and simple. Casual sex. That was all it was meant to be!” I whined.\\n\\n Stop acting like a damn girl!\\n\\n A look of annoyance crossed Teeny’s face before she scowled at me “What the fuck you’re doing is pulling your head outta your ass and getting with the motherfucking program, babe.”\\n\\n “What the fuck?”\\n\\n She calmed herself, turned back to me and said, “Scar, inside right now is a sexy-as-hell guy, who’s so into you, it’s kinda scary. He’s a decent guy from what I can see, and you are standing in your own way. What if he’s it, babe? What if he’s not just another asshole wrapped in tin foil? What if he’s your knight in shining armor? Are you going to throw that chance away because you’re a little scared?”\\n\\n Well she kind of made sense. What could it hurt? It was only my heart, right?\\n\\n Just as I had been about to tell her what I was feeling for Mace and just how scared I was, I felt his presence behind me, followed by his deep voice by my ear, “Keep this on it for a bit, babe. You won’t be inking anyone for a few days, but this’ll keep the swelling to a minimum.” Mace reached over and gently placed a towel full of ice on my hand, kissed the side of my neck and walked off toward the drinks cooler. Teeny and I both watched after him as he grabbed three beers and headed back our way.\\n\\n “What if he breaks my heart?”\\n\\n “What if he doesn’t?” Teeny answered, looking past me.\\n\\n I hated when she was right.\\n\\n I jumped up. As I walked past Mace, he handed me my beer and wrapped a large strong arm around my waist halting my progress. “Starting to get it now, aren’t you? I’m gonna get what I want here, Scar. Forget casual sex, babe; this isn’t just a bit of fun,” he said, snuggling his face into my neck.\\n\\n My heart skipped a beat. Avoiding his question all together, I muttered, “Goin’ to change.”\\n\\n I turned and went to get ready for the pool, thinking that Mace might just be that dream guy I was chasing. If it wasn’t for the niggling feeling he was hiding something...\\n\\n The rest of the day was a blast; the sun was shining, the drinks were cold, there was great food and even better friends. Teeny, Haven, Milla, a few of the other girls and I decided to play an impromptu game of water volleyball, leaving everyone in a fit of giggles. Mostly caused by Teeny and I dunking each other; we were both competitive even when on the same team.\\n\\n Mace had been hands on since our little chat earlier, always finding a reason to have his hand on me, kiss me or just be near me. I realized quickly he was a very attentive guy, which didn’t bother me in the slightest. If I was honest with myself, I loved the feel of his strong, hard body pressed up against my back, his thick arm wrapped around my waist, hand on my hip in a slightly possessive but still sweet gesture. He made me feel all that warm, squishy shit deep in my stomach.\\n\\n I was still at a standstill with myself, but figured what was the harm in lapping up the affection for a while, having a little fun while it lasted. I wasn’t leading him on; he knew where I stood.\\n\\n Thick arms wrapped around my waist. Mace’s warm body pressed against my back as he kissed my neck and whispered against the shell of my ear, “Ready to go, babe?”\\n\\n “Mmm-hmm, sure. Can you take me to the shop first?” Earlier in the day, I’d had an idea, and seeing as the swelling had gone down in my hand, allowing me to move it freely, I figured now was as good a time as any.\\n\\n “What’re we doing here?” Mace asked as I turned on the lights in the back of the parlor and made my way to my station.\\n\\n “You said you wanted more ink. You’re getting an afterhours appointment”\\n\\n Surprised, he asked, “You’re gonna do it now? Are you sure? What about your hand?\\n\\n “My hand’s fine now, see.” I flexed my hand a few times to show him it was okay. “I’ve got the sketch you drew up ready to go; all I need is my canvas.” I pulled all my equipment out and checked everything was wrapped and set in the right places. I sat on my rolling stool in front of Mace which put me directly at crotch level, really not the best place for my concentration at that point. Clearing my throat, I spoke softly “You need to lose the—Oh…”\\n\\n Mace stood before me shirtless; his bare chest and washboard abs on display made my mouth water. My gaze followed his stomach down along the light trail of hair leading into the top of his pants, those perfect V shaped lower abdominal muscles were enough to make any woman want to lean forward and lick them. My panties became wet as my thoughts careened directly to the gutter. “Hop up on the table, and lie down on your left side for me, please.”\\n\\n I cleaned and prepped Mace’s arms. The whole while I felt his eyes on me, heating my skin from the inside out. Placing the stencil was a little distracting to say the least, the tips of my fingers running over his smooth skin, the feel of his accelerated heartbeat, the warmth of his body. His intoxicating smell so close to me had me breathing heavier than normal. Looking over to see he had been watching intently, sent goose bumps across my skin. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tattered-love-needle-s-kiss-1/page-10.html","bookId":1954,"book":{"id":1954,"title":"Tattered Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #1)","description":"Storyline: Tattered Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #1) \\n When ex-Special Ops bad-ass Mace walks into Needle\u0027s Kiss tattoo parlour, he never expected to find the girl who would turn his life upside down. \\n Hard as nails Scarlett has been unlucky in love: she’s been burnt, chewed up and spat out.
