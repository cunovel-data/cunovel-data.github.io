I won’t leave without him.”\n “Then you got a problem, don’t you?”\n The two alphas glared at each other, neither willing to give an inch.\n Casey stood for a long moment with his fists clenched before turning and going back into the room with Rory, slamming the door in Marco’s face. Rory was still sound asleep. He slipped off his jeans and got into bed beside him, wrapping his arms around his waist and pulling his hot body up close to him. He kissed the side of his neck and trailed kisses down to his shoulder, giving it a little nip. Casey thought he’d never be able to get enough of him. He put his hand over Rory’s smooth penis, fingering the base, stunned by the lack of Rory’s knot. It dissolved, was absorbed into his body, or something when they mated, or maybe when his wolf died. Either way his penis was no longer wolfish in shape, but like a human’s or a pet’s.\n Mine, he thought possessively, stroking it tenderly. Rory moaned in his sleep. He thought about his words the night before and how prophetic they had been. No more wolf for you, baby. That’s your punishment, sweetheart. He smiled to himself. Now I’ve seen to it you’ll never shift again.\n He meant what he’d said to Marco. He was glad Rory’s wolf, the bestial, murderous part of him, was gone. Rory was different now, and his life would be changed forever. He loved Rory— he couldn’t deny that. But he owed his brother some measure of revenge, and he had to see this through and not be weakened by his feelings for Rory. The first steps had been taken. Now he had to stay the course. Rory was no longer a wolf, but a pet, and his mate. Casey’s natural dominant nature thrilled to the idea. He hadn’t been able to kill Rory, but he’d killed the wolf, and Rory belonged to him. Body and soul. Maybe he hadn’t been honest with Rory and told him who he really was, but he hadn’t lied when he said he’d take care of him.\n Nicky stared out the window at the coming storm. The clouds were gathering over the mountain, piling up on top of each other and competing to see which one could turn the darkest blue. The sky was taking on the strange, almost greenish hue that sometimes comes before a bad storm, and electricity seemed to crackle in the air. Marco tugged on his back pocket and pulled him down into his lap.\n “Don’t stand by the window—we’re about to have a lightning storm.” Nicky put his head down on Marco’s shoulder. “What’s the matter, baby?” Marco said softly. “Is it Rory?”\n “Yes,” he said with a sigh. “I kind of miss him already.”\n Marco tightened his lips. “He’s not gone anywhere yet. I’ve given orders not to let them leave until I say so.”\n “You can’t keep them here forever if Casey wants to leave.”\n “Watch me.”\n “Oh, Marco, be serious. You never given much thought to the family I left behind when I became werekin. You only knew you had to have me, and I belonged with you. Rory’s his mate now, and he gave himself to Casey willingly.”\n “Under false pretenses. Casey didn’t tell him who he really was or what his intentions were.”\n “He tried so hard to avoid this situation, and we kept telling him he had to face it. Now look what’s happened.”\n Marco put a hand to Nicky’s cheek. “It was a blood match, baby. I just wish I’d discovered who he was before they mated. Rory would have had all the information at least and could have decided if he wanted to stay away from him.”\n “He still can if he has the strength to.”\n “I don’t think he’s that strong. It took everything I had to stay away from you as long as I did. I couldn’t have kept it up much longer.”\n Nicky gave him a kiss and stood to pace around the room. “I need to talk to Casey again. I have to tell him about his brother.”\n “I think you need to stay out of this and let me handle it.”\n “I’m involved in this too, Marco. I’m the one his brother kidnapped, you know. I know what he told me and I saw his face. I know what he was planning to do to me, and if Casey understands that, he’ll understand why Rory attacked him.”\n Marco blew out a strong breath. “Yes, but he didn’t actually do more than kidnap you, Nicky. Casey was right. I never should have allowed Rory to attack him like that. I was just so damned enraged when he took you in the first place and then held the knife to your throat. I wanted to jump him myself, I guess. When Rory charged in, I should have stopped him. I knew he was young and inexperienced and in poor control of his wolf. It was my fault just as much as Rory’s.”\n Marco dropped his head into his hands, and Nicky quickly went to him, putting his hands on his shoulders, kneading them. “Well, we can play the blame game all day, but it won’t help, sweetheart.\n “I know. This is the last damn thing I needed. I’m worried about this Hunter situation. We got word yesterday they’re moving this way. Some of their scouts may already be in our area.”\n “Is there anything we can do for Rory?” Nicky asked softly.\n “I don’t know. I’ll speak to some of the elders and look through some of the old books, but I doubt I’ll find anything about this kind of situation. I’ve never known of a blood match between wolves, but wolves must have bred with wolves in the early years. Casey said he sensed Rory’s wolf was gone, so we just have to accept the idea. My issue is with Rory’s state of mind. Can he accept this change? Can he accept the fact that Casey lied to him and wants to control him? You know how difficult it was for you and you weren’t a wolf or even used to our ways.”\n “And Casey isn’t doing it because of traditions. He’s doing it to hurt him.”\n “I don’t trust Casey not to physically abuse him, either. He wants to punish Rory for his brother’s death. If he does, I swear I’ll…”\n “Casey loves him. I know he does, and he was worried about him too. Besides Casey said Rory’s wolf is dead and the part of Rory he hates is gone. Once he fully realizes that, maybe there won’t even be an issue. We have to give them time to work this out. Give Casey time to realize love is more important than revenge. In the meantime, is there anything you can do to keep them here without totally going to war with him?”\n “I have something in mind, but it depends on Casey and how willing he is to cooperate. He blames me as much as he does Rory.”\n “He likes me though,” Nicky teased, batting his eyelashes to lighten the mood.\n Marco smiled. “Everybody likes you, baby.”\n “Really? Everybody? So can I be the one to talk to Casey, Marco? You tell me what you have in mind and let me try to sell him on it.”\n Marco pulled him into his lap. “Hmm. And how exactly did you plan to ‘sell him’ on it, Nicky?”\n “I’m not sure. What do you think I should I do to win him over? Do you think I should flirt with him a bit? I don’t really like boys except for you, sweetheart, but Casey is very good looking. Sexy too. I could make an exception I guess, just this once.”\n A hard swat on his backside got Nicky’s attention. “Ow! What was that for? I was just asking your opinion.”\n “And I was giving it to you. You don’t flirt with anyone but me, Nicky. You got that?” He ran his hands over Nicky’s gorgeous body. “This is all mine, baby, and don’t you ever forget it. As a matter of fact, maybe I should give you a little refresher course on just how much you belong to me.”\n “Mmm…my memory has been bad lately. Maybe a little memory jog would be good for me. Tell me again what I need to know.”\n Marco was so busy stripping off Nicky’s pants, he didn’t answer. Once he had him naked, he picked him up and settled him on his lap, straddling and facing him. He traced Nicky’s muscled abs with his tongue.\n “Oh God,” Nicky whispered when Marco’s tongue flicked over his nipple.\n Marco licked down toward his navel. He slid out of the chair, never losing his grip on his mate and laid Nicky on his back on the carpeted floor. Wrapping his hand around Nicky’s cock, he held it out of the way so he could tease Nicky around the base with his tongue and teeth. Nicky wiggled his hips, trying to get Marco to tighten his grip or move or do something more. Marco nipped the sensitive area between his groin and his thigh, and Nicky yelped.\n “Be still.”\n Hearing something in Marco’s tone he hadn’t expected, Nicky held himself rigid, watching Marco closely as he licked up the shaft of his cock to reach the slit in his cockhead. He stuck his tongue inside the slit, and Nicky bucked his hips and moaned loudly. Marco’s finger penetrated his ass, searching for and finding his prostate. He pressed on it, and Nicky almost lost it, but just as he was about to come, Marco removed his finger, leaving him moaning in frustration. Marco was deliberately teasing him.\n Marco took Nicky’s pre-cum to lubricate them both, Nicky raised his knees to his shoulders, making it easier, and Marco plunged his cock into Nicky’s ass. Nicky moaned his pleasure as Marco thrust gently into him, again and again, using his hands to stroke along his sides. The head of Marco’s dick stroked Nicky’s prostate, teasing and torturing him.\n “Make yourself come for me, baby. Put your hands on yourself and make yourself come.”\n Nicky opened his eyes and whimpered a little, but Marco was firm. “Do it now, Nicky, while I watch you.”\n Nicky kept his eyes on Marco’s as he slowly hooked his legs over Marco’s broad shoulders and took his hard cock in hand. He pulled at it and at the same time Marco shifted his position.\n “You need a lesson as well as a reminder, Nicky.”\n In that instant Nicky realized what he’d sensed in Marco’s actions. He had broken a pack law in touching a male who was not family. Marco was going to show him how much he belonged exclusively to him. Only on rare occasions did Marco impale him with his knot. Pain and pleasure awaited. Excited, knowing what was coming, Nicky pushed out hard, opening the ring of muscle clinging to Marco’s cock. Marco put the strength of his legs and hips into the thrust, and the hard gland knot shot in, like having a small baseball shoved up his ass. Nicky yelped in pain. He could swear the knot grew just as his cock grew in his hands. Marco’s hips flexed, grinding his knot against Nicky’s prostate. Nicky stroked himself as he’d been ordered to do, his hands and body jerking wildly. Marco watched his face, breathing hard, matching his strokes to Nicky’s. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cry-wolf-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-2/page-11.html","bookId":2254,"book":{"id":2254,"title":"Cry Wolf (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Cry Wolf (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #2) \n Casey, a good looking young wolf shifter has sworn to kill the man who killed his brother.
