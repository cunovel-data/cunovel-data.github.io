{"id":86400,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The evening before, Rory’s lack of acknowledgment had irritated Casey. Rory planned today to ignore him completely, and what he would say to that? He had to show the larger wolf he was not about to be dominated or told what to do. He was a wolf, not a submissive. He would not, could not be anything but a wolf. So why were his palms damp just thinking about Casey’s possible displeasure? As they came over, Casey was right up front. Oddly, he didn’t make eye contact with Rory, and Rory felt a tug of disappointment. Rory spoke to the group, assuming a confidence he didn’t really feel. “Is everyone ready to work? The alpha wants us to do the unskilled labor, just general clean-up of the work site, picking up nails and discarded lumber, and so forth, pretty much whatever the beta tells us. We’ll break for lunch around noon for an hour and get off at three o’clock. Any questions?” “Yes, I have one.” Rory knew without even looking who was speaking. He tightened his lips and turned toward Casey. “Yes? Still need to know how old I am before you can go to work?” Casey raised his eyebrows innocently and said, “No. Although you never did say, come to think of it. But no, I was just going to ask about bathroom breaks. Do we get those? I was just wondering.” Knowing he was being a smartass, Rory tried to answer calmly, not letting Casey rattle him. “Just as many as you need, uh…Connor, isn’t it?” Casey’s eyes narrowed, promising payback for pretending to forget his name, and Rory got a stomach full of butterflies. “The name’s Casey. Not a hard name to remember, but maybe after you shout it out a few times, it’ll stick with you.” Rory felt the hot blood staining his cheeks. He lifted his chin, walked quickly past him and out the door to the worksite, hearing a soft chuckle behind him. Ian already had a construction crew on site, getting started. Rory introduced him to the new crew and then stood aside for Ian to tell them what needed to be done. Ian, a quiet person, carefully considered his words before he ever spoke, the sign of a good advisor and a good beta. His mate had died in childbirth over two years ago, and he had almost grieved himself to death. Sorrow to such a degree was another drawback to mating for life. When your mate was unavailable to you, for whatever reason, there was no backup plan. If you were very lucky, you might find a love match, but that was difficult and rare for wolves. Jobs were assigned, and Rory was happy to see his crew working hard and doing a good job. Casey stayed near the back of the new addition, working with some of the roofers, sparing Rory his remarks and sidelong looks. He could still smell him though, even from so far away, and he was really becoming used to that smell, clogging his nostrils and setting up a deep craving in him. All he wanted to do was go find Casey, step into his arms, and breathe him in deeply. He could see Nicky in his mind’s eye, always putting his nose against Marco’s neck. Now he understood why. As the morning wore on, the sun became very warm, with only the cool southwesterly breeze keeping it from being uncomfortable. Unusually warm weather for March, but it made for ideal working conditions. At lunchtime, Casey came around the building, minus his shirt, and Rory caught his breath. His body was sculpted and cut with muscles, skin was tanned and brown. His abs were washboard flat, and he had almost no hair on his chest at all, just a little treasure trail below his navel, disappearing into his jeans. Perfect, of course, Rory thought bitterly, and dropped his gaze quickly when Casey caught him looking. Casey walked over to where he was making notes. He was sweating a little, and the cool breeze picked up the scent and waved it temptingly under Rory’s nose, begging him to take a bite of those enticing abs. He stood for a moment until Rory looked up at him. “I changed my mind, you know. You’re not my mate, after all.” Momentarily shocked by the sharp pain slashing through him at the words, Rory dropped his gaze for a moment before raising his head again. “Good. Then we agree, so leave me alone.” “Not a problem.” Casey shot him a furious look and stalked off to stand a few feet away talking to one of the other gammas, his back firmly turned to Rory. Rory clenched his fists, determined not to let this man get to him, but he’d crawled under his skin with ease. To Rory’s shame, his cock jumped to attention, rigid and ready, at the sound of Casey’s voice. He couldn’t let Casey see how much he wanted him, and he definitely couldn’t let Casey see how much his words hurt. Wanting to get away from him, Rory jumped to his feet and turned, running into one of the day laborers brought onto the job from the nearby town of Brevard. The big, burly man was carrying a large sheet of plywood. Rory knocked the sheet from the man’s hand, almost knocking him over as well. The man turned on Rory angrily. “Hey, watch where you’re going! Dammit!” A meaty hand on Rory’s chest shoved him backward. Caught off balance, Rory fell hard, smashed his elbow against the ground and yelped out in pain. Before Rory could react, Casey crossed the short distance between them and was in the man’s face, his expression murderous. “You got a problem, buddy, take it up with me. Keep your fucking hands off him! It was an accident, and you’re fixing to have a bad one if you touch him again!” “Okay, okay, sorry!” His nerve breaking at the sight of the furious, massive young wolf in his face, the man picked up his piece of plywood and moved quickly away. Rory watched the exchange with his mouth open and the strangest warm tingling he’d ever had swept over him. Casey turned to Rory and stood over him looking down. “Did he hurt you?” “No, no, I’m fine.” “What about your elbow?” Rory realized he was cradling his elbow in his hand. He dropped it quickly. “No, no. I’m okay, really.” “Right. Good. Okay then.” Casey turned around and walked away quickly. Grabbing his shirt, he shrugged it on and hurried back toward the compound for lunch, leaving Rory still on the ground, staring after him in surprise and feeling as strangely bereft from Casey walking away as he’d felt excited when Casey protected him. The rest of the day passed slowly. Casey tried to stay away from Rory as much as he could, his feelings in conflicting confusion. He finished his work for the day and walked tiredly back to the compound. Rory had left an hour or so before. Casey knew when Rory left, as certainly as if he’d come to tell him. He could already sense a great deal about him, and he knew if—or when—they mated, he’d be able to pick up his thoughts as well. Casey was by far the most dominant wolf in the equation, and he suffered no doubts Rory, as driven as he was, would answer the blood call. The problem was the idea of mating with Rory was the most difficult thing in the world. It just wasn’t possible for Rory to be his mate. What kind of crazy cosmic joke was this, anyway? He’d come to the Mountain Wolf compound for one reason and one reason only—to kill the wolf called Rory, taking his justifiable revenge against the man who’d killed his brother. How could this killer be his bloodmate? It just didn’t seem within the realm of possibility. When he’d first arrived with the rogue group, he’d been given a list and told to pick a work station. When he saw Rory’s name as a gamma, along with a wolf named Ian as crew leader, he’d been excited over how easily he’d located his brother’s murderer and could get close to him. He’d signed up for the work detail immediately. He’d shown up for work early, anxious to get a good look at the man he was soon going to kill. The delicious smell wafting into the common room stunned him at first and then fascinated him. Wolves never knew when they might meet their blood match, and it usually came when they least expected. Certainly, now, while he was on a vengeance quest for his brother, was not a time he expected to run into his mate, but the scent intrigued and beckoned him. When the young, gorgeous wolf walked into the room, Casey could barely restrain himself from leaping over the chairs between them and taking him right there in front of everyone. He was smaller than average, but perfect, with beautiful little features and curly brown hair. He definitely had the cutest little bubble butt Casey had seen in a long time. Casey had a sudden vision of his cock stuck firmly between those delectable ass cheeks. The young wolf seemed not to even notice him, and Casey found himself incensed and determined to make him pay attention. He assumed the young man was Ian, the crew leader. When they stood close together, just before the alpha told them to break it up, he had been very tempted to kiss his beautiful young wolf right then. When the alpha’s mate, Nicky, called him not Ian, but Rory, Casey was devastated and rocked to his core. All he could do was run back to his room and lick his wounds, trying to figure out how such an insane thing could have happened. By morning, he’d pretty much convinced himself he was mistaken, and he wasn’t nearly as attracted to Rory as he thought he was. Casey was strong—he’d always been strong willed and able to do anything he put his mind to doing. He could beat this thing. He’d steel himself against the little murdering bastard and not be bothered by any stupid smell. He could do this. Rory was not his mate. The very idea was ludicrous. He left his room the next morning confident and strong, ready to put aside any tender feelings he might still be harboring for the young wolf. That lasted until Rory walked in with his little notebook, looking nervous and tired, with bluish shadows under his pretty eyes, like he hadn’t slept well. Tenderness, love, and passion almost overwhelmed Casey, and his shoulders slumped in defeat. He planned on ignoring him, but once again, he had to speak to him, to tease him, to make Rory notice him, like a damn kid. Later, when the dude pushed him down at the work site, he literally saw red. Damn! He felt so protective of him, he wanted to wrap him up in cotton and keep him safe. Casey walked back to the compound dragging his feet, dreading the evening when he might see him again at supper. In the common room for dinner, he looked for Rory right away, spotting him sitting at the table of the alpha, Marco. Marco’s beautiful mate, Nicky, was with them, and he gave Casey a little wave as he walked in. Rory pretended not to see Casey.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cry-wolf-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-2/page-4.html","bookId":2254,"book":{"id":2254,"title":"Cry Wolf (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #2)","description":"Storyline: Cry Wolf (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #2) Casey, a good looking young wolf shifter has sworn to kill the man who killed his brother.
