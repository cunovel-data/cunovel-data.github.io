{"id":3950,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"Fire Eater sneezes and forgives Pinocchio,who saves his friend, Harlequin, from deathIn the theater, great excitement reigned.\n 　　Fire Eater (this was really his name) was very ugly, but he was far from being as bad as he looked. Proof ofthis is that, when he saw the poor Marionette beingbrought in to him, struggling with fear and crying, \"Idon\u0027t want to die! I don\u0027t want to die!\" he felt sorry forhim and began first to waver and then to weaken. Finally,he could control himself no longer and gave a loud sneeze.\n 　　At that sneeze, Harlequin, who until then had beenas sad as a weeping willow, smiled happily and leaningtoward the Marionette, whispered to him:\n 　　\"Good news, brother mine! Fire Eater has sneezedand this is a sign that he feels sorry for you.\n 　　You are saved!\"For be it known, that, while other people, when sadand sorrowful, weep and wipe their eyes, Fire Eater, onthe other hand, had the strange habit of sneezing eachtime he felt unhappy. The way was just as good as anyother to show the kindness of his heart.\n 　　After sneezing, Fire Eater, ugly as ever, cried to Pinocchio:\n 　　\"Stop crying! Your wails give me a funny feelingdown here in my stomach and--E--tchee!--E--tchee!\"Two loud sneezes finished his speech.\n 　　\"God bless you!\" said Pinocchio.\n 　　\"Thanks! Are your father and mother still living?\"demanded Fire Eater.\n 　　\"My father, yes. My mother I have never known.\"\"Your poor father would suffer terribly if I were touse you as firewood. Poor old man! I feel sorry forhim! E--tchee! E--tchee! E--tchee!\" Three more sneezessounded, louder than ever.\n 　　\"God bless you!\" said Pinocchio.\n 　　\"Thanks! However, I ought to be sorry for myself,too, just now. My good dinner is spoiled. I have nomore wood for the fire, and the lamb is only half cooked.\n 　　Never mind! In your place I\u0027ll burn some other Marionette.\n 　　Hey there! Officers!\"At the call, two wooden officers appeared, long andthin as a yard of rope, with queer hats on their headsand swords in their hands.\n 　　Fire Eater yelled at them in a hoarse voice:\n 　　\"Take Harlequin, tie him, and throw him on the fire.\n 　　I want my lamb well done!\"Think how poor Harlequin felt! He was so scaredthat his legs doubled up under him and he fell to the floor.\n 　　Pinocchio, at that heartbreaking sight, threw himselfat the feet of Fire Eater and, weeping bitterly, askedin a pitiful voice which could scarcely be heard:\n 　　\"Have pity, I beg of you, signore!\"\"There are no signori here!\"\"Have pity, kind sir!\"\"There are no sirs here!\"\"Have pity, your Excellency!\"On hearing himself addressed as your Excellency, theDirector of the Marionette Theater sat up very straightin his chair, stroked his long beard, and becoming suddenlykind and compassionate, smiled proudly as he said to Pinocchio:\n 　　\"Well, what do you want from me now, Marionette?\"\"I beg for mercy for my poor friend, Harlequin, whohas never done the least harm in his life.\"\"There is no mercy here, Pinocchio. I have sparedyou. Harlequin must burn in your place. I am hungryand my dinner must be cooked.\"\"In that case,\" said Pinocchio proudly, as he stoodup and flung away his cap of dough, \"in that case, myduty is clear. Come, officers! Tie me up and throw meon those flames. No, it is not fair for poor Harlequin,the best friend that I have in the world, to die in my place!\"These brave words, said in a piercing voice, made allthe other Marionettes cry. Even the officers, who weremade of wood also, cried like two babies.\n 　　Fire Eater at first remained hard and cold as a pieceof ice; but then, little by little, he softened and began tosneeze. And after four or five sneezes, he opened widehis arms and said to Pinocchio:\n 　　\"You are a brave boy! Come to my arms and kiss me!\"Pinocchio ran to him and scurrying like a squirrel up thelong black beard, he gave Fire Eater a loving kiss on thetip of his nose.\n 　　\"Has pardon been granted to me?\" asked poorHarlequin with a voice that was hardly a breath.\n 　　\"Pardon is yours!\" answered Fire Eater; and sighingand wagging his head, he added: \"Well, tonight I shallhave to eat my lamb only half cooked, but beware thenext time, Marionettes.\"At the news that pardon had been given, theMarionettes ran to the stage and, turning on all the lights,they danced and sang till dawn.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/327/3150.html","bookId":135,"book":{"id":135,"title":"木偶奇遇记 The Adventures of Pinocchio","description":"简介： The Adventures of Pinocchio is a novel for children by Italian author Carlo Collodi, written in Florence.
