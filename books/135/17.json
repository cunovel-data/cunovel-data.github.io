I should take it every day.\"\"Now keep your promise and drink these few dropsof water. They\u0027ll be good for you.\"Pinocchio took the glass in both hands and stuck hisnose into it. He lifted it to his mouth and once morestuck his nose into it.\n 　　\"It is too bitter, much too bitter! I can\u0027t drink it.\"\"How do you know, when you haven\u0027t even tasted it?\"\"I can imagine it. I smell it. I want another lump ofsugar, then I\u0027ll drink it.\"The Fairy, with all the patience of a good mother, gavehim more sugar and again handed him the glass.\n 　　\"I can\u0027t drink it like that,\" the Marionette said, makingmore wry faces.\n 　　\"Why?\"\"Because that feather pillow on my feet bothers me.\"The Fairy took away the pillow.\n 　　\"It\u0027s no use. I can\u0027t drink it even now.\"\"What\u0027s the matter now?\"\"I don\u0027t like the way that door looks. It\u0027s half open.\"The Fairy closed the door.\n 　　\"I won\u0027t drink it,\" cried Pinocchio, bursting out crying.\n 　　\"I won\u0027t drink this awful water. I won\u0027t. I won\u0027t!\n 　　No, no, no, no!\"\"My boy, you\u0027ll be sorry.\"\"I don\u0027t care.\"\"You are very sick.\"\"I don\u0027t care.\"\"In a few hours the fever will take you far away to another world.\"\"I don\u0027t care.\"\"Aren\u0027t you afraid of death?\"\"Not a bit. I\u0027d rather die than drink that awful medicine.\"At that moment, the door of the room flew open and incame four Rabbits as black as ink, carrying a small blackcoffin on their shoulders.\n 　　\"What do you want from me?\" asked Pinocchio.\n 　　\"We have come for you,\" said the largest Rabbit.\n 　　\"For me? But I\u0027m not dead yet!\"\"No, not dead yet; but you will be in a few momentssince you have refused to take the medicine which wouldhave made you well.\"\"Oh, Fairy, my Fairy,\" the Marionette cried out, \"give methat glass! Quick, please! I don\u0027t want to die!\n 　　No, no, not yet--not yet!\"And holding the glass with his two hands, he swallowedthe medicine at one gulp.\n 　　\"Well,\" said the four Rabbits, \"this time we have madethe trip for nothing.\"And turning on their heels, they marched solemnly outof the room, carrying their little black coffin and mutteringand grumbling between their teeth.\n 　　In a twinkling, Pinocchio felt fine. With one leap hewas out of bed and into his clothes.\n 　　The Fairy, seeing him run and jump around the roomgay as a bird on wing, said to him:\n 　　\"My medicine was good for you, after all, wasn\u0027t it?\"\"Good indeed! It has given me new life.\"\"Why, then, did I have to beg you so hard to makeyou drink it?\"\"I\u0027m a boy, you see, and all boys hate medicine morethan they do sickness.\"\"What a shame! Boys ought to know, after all, thatmedicine, taken in time, can save them from much painand even from death.\"\"Next time I won\u0027t have to be begged so hard. I\u0027llremember those black Rabbits with the black coffin ontheir shoulders and I\u0027ll take the glass and pouf!--down itwill go!\"\"Come here now and tell me how it came about thatyou found yourself in the hands of the Assassins.\"\"It happened that Fire Eater gave me five gold piecesto give to my Father, but on the way, I met a Fox and aCat, who asked me, `Do you want the five pieces to becometwo thousand?\u0027 And I said, `Yes.\u0027 And they said,`Come with us to the Field of Wonders.\u0027 And I said,`Let\u0027s go.\u0027 Then they said, `Let us stop at the Inn of theRed Lobster for dinner and after midnight we\u0027ll set outagain.\u0027 We ate and went to sleep. When I awoke theywere gone and I started out in the darkness all alone. On the road I met two Assassins dressed in black coal sacks,who said to me, `Your money or your life!\u0027 and I said,`I haven\u0027t any money\u0027; for, you see, I had put the moneyunder my tongue. One of them tried to put his hand inmy mouth and I bit it off and spat it out; but it wasn\u0027t ahand, it was a cat\u0027s paw. And they ran after me and Iran and ran, till at last they caught me and tied my neckwith a rope and hanged me to a tree, saying, `Tomorrowwe\u0027ll come back for you and you\u0027ll be dead and yourmouth will be open, and then we\u0027ll take the gold piecesthat you have hidden under your tongue.\u0027\"\"Where are the gold pieces now?\" the Fairy asked.\n 　　\"I lost them,\" answered Pinocchio, but he told a lie,for he had them in his pocket.\n 　　As he spoke, his nose, long though it was, became atleast two inches longer.\n 　　\"And where did you lose them?\"\"In the wood near by.\"At this second lie, his nose grew a few more inches.\n 　　\"If you lost them in the near-by wood,\" said the Fairy,\"we\u0027ll look for them and find them, for everything that islost there is always found.\"\"Ah, now I remember,\" replied the Marionette,becoming more and more confused. \"I did not lose the goldpieces, but I swallowed them when I drank the medicine.\"At this third lie, his nose became longer than ever,so long that he could not even turn around. If he turnedto the right, he knocked it against the bed or into thewindowpanes; if he turned to the left, he struck the wallsor the door; if he raised it a bit, he almost put the Fairy\u0027seyes out.\n 　　The Fairy sat looking at him and laughing.\n 　　\"Why do you laugh?\" the Marionette asked her,worried now at the sight of his growing nose.\n 　　\"I am laughing at your lies.\"\"How do you know I am lying?\"\"Lies, my boy, are known in a moment. There are twokinds of lies, lies with short legs and lies with long noses.\n 　　Yours, just now, happen to have long noses.\"Pinocchio, not knowing where to hide his shame, triedto escape from the room, but his nose had become so longthat he could not get it out of the door.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/327/3156.html","bookId":135,"book":{"id":135,"title":"木偶奇遇记 The Adventures of Pinocchio","description":"简介： The Adventures of Pinocchio is a novel for children by Italian author Carlo Collodi, written in Florence.
