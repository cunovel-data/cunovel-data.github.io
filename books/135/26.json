{"id":3965,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"Pinocchio goes to the seashore with his friendsto see the Terrible SharkIn the morning, bright and early, Pinocchio started for school. 　　Imagine what the boys said when they saw a Marionetteenter the classroom! They laughed until they cried. Everyoneplayed tricks on him. One pulled his hat off, anothertugged at his coat, a third tried to paint a mustache underhis nose. One even attempted to tie strings to his feet andhis hands to make him dance. 　　For a while Pinocchio was very calm and quiet. Finally,however, he lost all patience and turning to his tormentors,he said to them threateningly: 　　\"Careful, boys, I haven\u0027t come here to be made fun of. 　　I\u0027ll respect you and I want you to respect me.\"\"Hurrah for Dr. Know-all! You have spoken like aprinted book!\" howled the boys, bursting with laughter. 　　One of them, more impudent than the rest, put out hishand to pull the Marionette\u0027s nose. 　　But he was not quick enough, for Pinocchio stretchedhis leg under the table and kicked him hard on the shin. 　　\"Oh, what hard feet!\" cried the boy, rubbing the spotwhere the Marionette had kicked him. 　　\"And what elbows! They are even harder than the feet!\"shouted another one, who, because of some other trick,had received a blow in the stomach. 　　With that kick and that blow Pinocchio gained everybody\u0027s favor. 　　Everyone admired him, danced attendance upon him, petted and caressed him. 　　As the days passed into weeks, even the teacher praised him,for he saw him attentive, hard working, and wide awake,always the first to come in the morning, and the lastto leave when school was over. 　　Pinocchio\u0027s only fault was that he had too many friends. 　　Among these were many well-known rascals, who carednot a jot for study or for success. 　　The teacher warned him each day, and even the goodFairy repeated to him many times: 　　\"Take care, Pinocchio! Those bad companions willsooner or later make you lose your love for study. 　　Some day they will lead you astray.\"\"There\u0027s no such danger,\" answered the Marionette,shrugging his shoulders and pointing to his forehead as ifto say, \"I\u0027m too wise.\"So it happened that one day, as he was walking to school,he met some boys who ran up to him and said: 　　\"Have you heard the news?\"\"No!\"\"A Shark as big as a mountain has been seen near the shore.\"\"Really? I wonder if it could be the same one I heardof when my father was drowned?\"\"We are going to see it. Are you coming?\"\"No, not I. I must go to school.\"\"What do you care about school? You can go there tomorrow. 　　With a lesson more or less, we are always the same donkeys.\"\"And what will the teacher say?\"\"Let him talk. He is paid to grumble all day long.\"\"And my mother?\"\"Mothers don\u0027t know anything,\" answered those scamps. 　　\"Do you know what I\u0027ll do?\" said Pinocchio. 　　\"For certain reasons of mine, I, too, want to see that Shark;but I\u0027ll go after school. I can see him then as well as now.\"\"Poor simpleton!\" cried one of the boys. \"Do you thinkthat a fish of that size will stand there waiting for you? 　　He turns and off he goes, and no one will ever be the wiser.\"\"How long does it take from here to the shore?\" asked the Marionette. 　　\"One hour there and back.\"\"Very well, then. Let\u0027s see who gets there first!\" cried Pinocchio. 　　At the signal, the little troop, with books under their arms,dashed across the fields. Pinocchio led the way, runningas if on wings, the others following as fast as they could. 　　Now and again, he looked back and, seeing his followershot and tired, and with tongues hanging out, he laughedout heartily. Unhappy boy! If he had only known thenthe dreadful things that were to happen to him on accountof his disobedience!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/327/3165.html","bookId":135,"book":{"id":135,"title":"木偶奇遇记 The Adventures of Pinocchio","description":"简介： The Adventures of Pinocchio is a novel for children by Italian author Carlo Collodi, written in Florence.
