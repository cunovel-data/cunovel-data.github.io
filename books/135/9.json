As he walked along, his brain was busyplanning hundreds of wonderful things, building hundredsof castles in the air. Talking to himself, he said: 　　\"In school today, I\u0027ll learn to read, tomorrow to write,and the day after tomorrow I\u0027ll do arithmetic. Then, cleveras I am, I can earn a lot of money. With the very firstpennies I make, I\u0027ll buy Father a new cloth coat. Cloth,did I say? No, it shall be of gold and silver with diamondbuttons. That poor man certainly deserves it; for, after all,isn\u0027t he in his shirt sleeves because he was good enough to buy a book for me? On this cold day, too! Fathers areindeed good to their children!\"As he talked to himself, he thought he heard sounds ofpipes and drums coming from a distance: pi-pi-pi,pi-pi-pi. . .zum, zum, zum, zum. 　　He stopped to listen. Those sounds came from a littlestreet that led to a small village along the shore. 　　\"What can that noise be? What a nuisance that I haveto go to school! Otherwise. . .\"There he stopped, very much puzzled. He felt he hadto make up his mind for either one thing or another. 　　Should he go to school, or should he follow the pipes? 　　\"Today I\u0027ll follow the pipes, and tomorrow I\u0027ll go toschool. There\u0027s always plenty of time to go to school,\"decided the little rascal at last, shrugging his shoulders. 　　No sooner said than done. He started down the street,going like the wind. On he ran, and louder grew thesounds of pipe and drum: pi-pi-pi, pi-pi-pi, pi-pi-pi. . .zum, zum, zum, zum. 　　Suddenly, he found himself in a large square, full ofpeople standing in front of a little wooden building paintedin brilliant colors. 　　\"What is that house?\" Pinocchio asked a little boy near him. 　　\"Read the sign and you\u0027ll know.\"\"I\u0027d like to read, but somehow I can\u0027t today.\"\"Oh, really? Then I\u0027ll read it to you. Know, then,that written in letters of fire I see the words: 　　GREAT MARIONETTE THEATER. 　　\"When did the show start?\"\"It is starting now.\"\"And how much does one pay to get in?\"\"Four pennies.\"Pinocchio, who was wild with curiosity to know whatwas going on inside, lost all his pride and said to the boyshamelessly: 　　\"Will you give me four pennies until tomorrow?\"\"I\u0027d give them to you gladly,\" answered the other,poking fun at him, \"but just now I can\u0027t give them to you.\"\"For the price of four pennies, I\u0027ll sell you my coat.\"\"If it rains, what shall I do with a coat of floweredpaper? I could not take it off again.\"\"Do you want to buy my shoes?\"\"They are only good enough to light a fire with.\"\"What about my hat?\"\"Fine bargain, indeed! A cap of dough! The mice mightcome and eat it from my head!\"Pinocchio was almost in tears. He was just about tomake one last offer, but he lacked the courage to do so. 　　He hesitated, he wondered, he could not make up his mind. 　　At last he said: 　　\"Will you give me four pennies for the book?\"\"I am a boy and I buy nothing from boys,\" said thelittle fellow with far more common sense than the Marionette. 　　\"I\u0027ll give you four pennies for your A-B-C book,\" saida ragpicker who stood by. 　　Then and there, the book changed hands. And to thinkthat poor old Geppetto sat at home in his shirt sleeves,shivering with cold, having sold his coat to buy that littlebook for his son!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/327/3148.html","bookId":135,"book":{"id":135,"title":"木偶奇遇记 The Adventures of Pinocchio","description":"简介： The Adventures of Pinocchio is a novel for children by Italian author Carlo Collodi, written in Florence.
