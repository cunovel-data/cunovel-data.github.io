{"id":3971,"no":32,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"Pinocchio\u0027s ears become like those of a Donkey.\\n\\n 　　In a little while he changes into a real Donkey and begins to brayEveryone, at one time or another, has found some surpriseawaiting him. Of the kind which Pinocchio had on thateventful morning of his life, there are but few.\\n\\n 　　What was it? I will tell you, my dear little readers.\\n\\n 　　On awakening, Pinocchio put his hand up to his head andthere he found--Guess!\\n\\n 　　He found that, during the night, his ears had grownat least ten full inches!\\n\\n 　　You must know that the Marionette, even from hisbirth, had very small ears, so small indeed that to thenaked eye they could hardly be seen. Fancy how he feltwhen he noticed that overnight those two dainty organshad become as long as shoe brushes!\\n\\n 　　He went in search of a mirror, but not finding any,he just filled a basin with water and looked at himself.\\n\\n 　　There he saw what he never could have wished to see.\\n\\n 　　His manly figure was adorned and enriched by a beautifulpair of donkey\u0027s ears.\\n\\n 　　I leave you to think of the terrible grief, the shame,the despair of the poor Marionette.\\n\\n 　　He began to cry, to scream, to knock his head againstthe wall, but the more he shrieked, the longer and themore hairy grew his ears.\\n\\n 　　At those piercing shrieks, a Dormouse came into theroom, a fat little Dormouse, who lived upstairs. SeeingPinocchio so grief-stricken, she asked him anxiously:\\n\\n 　　\"What is the matter, dear little neighbor?\"\"I am sick, my little Dormouse, very, very sick--andfrom an illness which frightens me! Do you understandhow to feel the pulse?\"\"A little.\"\"Feel mine then and tell me if I have a fever.\"The Dormouse took Pinocchio\u0027s wrist between her paws and,after a few minutes, looked up at him sorrowfully and said:\\n\\n 　　\"My friend, I am sorry, but I must give you some very sad news.\"\"What is it?\"\"You have a very bad fever.\"\"But what fever is it?\"\"The donkey fever.\"\"I don\u0027t know anything about that fever,\" answered the Marionette,beginning to understand even too well what was happening to him.\\n\\n 　　\"Then I will tell you all about it,\" said the Dormouse.\\n\\n 　　\"Know then that, within two or three hours, you will nolonger be a Marionette, nor a boy.\"\"What shall I be?\"\"Within two or three hours you will become a real donkey,just like the ones that pull the fruit carts to market.\"\"Oh, what have I done? What have I done?\" cried Pinocchio,grasping his two long ears in his hands and pulling and tuggingat them angrily, just as if they belonged to another.\\n\\n 　　\"My dear boy,\" answered the Dormouse to cheer him up a bit,\"why worry now? What is done cannot be undone, you know.\\n\\n 　　Fate has decreed that all lazy boys who come to hate booksand schools and teachers and spend all their days with toysand games must sooner or later turn into donkeys.\"\"But is it really so?\" asked the Marionette, sobbing bitterly.\\n\\n 　　\"I am sorry to say it is. And tears now are useless.\\n\\n 　　You should have thought of all this before.\"\"But the fault is not mine. Believe me, little Dormouse,the fault is all Lamp-Wick\u0027s.\"\"And who is this Lamp-Wick?\"\"A classmate of mine. I wanted to return home. I wantedto be obedient. I wanted to study and to succeedin school, but Lamp-Wick said to me, `Why do you wantto waste your time studying? Why do you want to goto school? Come with me to the Land of Toys.\\n\\n 　　There we\u0027ll never study again. There we can enjoyourselves and be happy from morn till night.\u0027\"\"And why did you follow the advice of that false friend?\"\"Why? Because, my dear little Dormouse, I am a heedlessMarionette--heedless and heartless. Oh! If I had onlyhad a bit of heart, I should never have abandonedthat good Fairy, who loved me so well and who has beenso kind to me! And by this time, I should no longer be aMarionette. I should have become a real boy, like all thesefriends of mine! Oh, if I meet Lamp-Wick I am goingto tell him what I think of him--and more, too!\"After this long speech, Pinocchio walked to the doorof the room. But when he reached it, remembering hisdonkey ears, he felt ashamed to show them to the publicand turned back. He took a large cotton bag from a shelf,put it on his head, and pulled it far down to his very nose.\\n\\n 　　Thus adorned, he went out. He looked for Lamp-Wick everywhere,along the streets, in the squares, inside the theatres,everywhere; but he was not to be found. He asked everyonewhom he met about him, but no one had seen him. In desperation,he returned home and knocked at the door.\\n\\n 　　\"Who is it?\" asked Lamp-Wick from within.\\n\\n 　　\"It is I!\" answered the Marionette.\\n\\n 　　\"Wait a minute.\"After a full half hour the door opened. Another surpriseawaited Pinocchio! There in the room stood his friend,with a large cotton bag on his head, pulled far down to his very nose.\\n\\n 　　At the sight of that bag, Pinocchio felt slightly happierand thought to himself:\\n\\n 　　\"My friend must be suffering from the same sicknessthat I am! I wonder if he, too, has donkey fever?\"But pretending he had seen nothing, he asked with a smile:\\n\\n 　　\"How are you, my dear Lamp-Wick?\"\"Very well. Like a mouse in a Parmesan cheese.\"\"Is that really true?\"\"Why should I lie to you?\"\"I beg your pardon, my friend, but why then are youwearing that cotton bag over your ears?\"\"The doctor has ordered it because one of my knees hurts.\\n\\n 　　And you, dear Marionette, why are you wearing that cotton bagdown to your nose?\"\"The doctor has ordered it because I have bruised my foot.\"\"Oh, my poor Pinocchio!\"\"Oh, my poor Lamp-Wick!\"An embarrassingly long silence followed these words,during which time the two friends looked at each otherin a mocking way.\\n\\n 　　Finally the Marionette, in a voice sweet as honey andsoft as a flute, said to his companion:\\n\\n 　　\"Tell me, Lamp-Wick, dear friend, have you eversuffered from an earache?\"\"Never! And you?\"\"Never! Still, since this morning my ear has been torturing me.\"\"So has mine.\"\"Yours, too? And which ear is it?\"\"Both of them. And yours?\"\"Both of them, too. I wonder if it could be the same sickness.\"\"I\u0027m afraid it is.\"\"Will you do me a favor, Lamp-Wick?\"\"Gladly! With my whole heart.\"\"Will you let me see your ears?\"\"Why not? But before I show you mine, I want to see yours,dear Pinocchio.\"\"No. You must show yours first.\"\"No, my dear! Yours first, then mine.\"\"Well, then,\" said the Marionette, \"let us make a contract.\"\"Let\u0027s hear the contract!\"\"Let us take off our caps together. All right?\"\"All right.\"\"Ready then!\"Pinocchio began to count, \"One! Two! Three!\"At the word \"Three!\" the two boys pulled off theircaps and threw them high in air.\\n\\n 　　And then a scene took place which is hard to believe,but it is all too true. The Marionette and his friend,Lamp-Wick, when they saw each other both stricken by thesame misfortune, instead of feeling sorrowful and ashamed,began to poke fun at each other, and after much nonsense,they ended by bursting out into hearty laughter.\\n\\n 　　They laughed and laughed, and laughed again--laughedtill they ached--laughed till they cried.\\n\\n 　　But all of a sudden Lamp-Wick stopped laughing. He totteredand almost fell. Pale as a ghost, he turned to Pinocchio and said:\\n\\n 　　\"Help, help, Pinocchio!\"\"What is the matter?\"\"Oh, help me! I can no longer stand up.\"\"I can\u0027t either,\" cried Pinocchio; and his laughterturned to tears as he stumbled about helplessly.\\n\\n 　　They had hardly finished speaking, when both of them fellon all fours and began running and jumping around the room.\\n\\n 　　As they ran, their arms turned into legs, their faces lengthenedinto snouts and their backs became covered with long gray hairs.\\n\\n 　　This was humiliation enough, but the most horriblemoment was the one in which the two poor creatures felttheir tails appear. Overcome with shame and grief,they tried to cry and bemoan their fate.\\n\\n 　　But what is done can\u0027t be undone! Instead of moansand cries, they burst forth into loud donkey brays, whichsounded very much like, \"Haw! Haw! Haw!\"At that moment, a loud knocking was heard at the doorand a voice called to them:\\n\\n 　　\"Open! I am the Little Man, the driver of the wagonwhich brought you here. Open, I say, or beware!\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/327/3171.html","bookId":135,"book":{"id":135,"title":"木偶奇遇记 The Adventures of Pinocchio","description":"简介： The Adventures of Pinocchio is a novel for children by Italian author Carlo Collodi, written in Florence.
