{"id":3955,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"The Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair sends for the poor Marionette,puts him to bed, and calls three Doctors to tell her if Pinocchiois dead or aliveIf the poor Marionette had dangled there much longer,all hope would have been lost. Luckily for him, theLovely Maiden with Azure Hair once again looked out ofher window. Filled with pity at the sight of the poor littlefellow being knocked helplessly about by the wind, sheclapped her hands sharply together three times.\n 　　At the signal, a loud whirr of wings in quick flight washeard and a large Falcon came and settled itself on thewindow ledge.\n 　　\"What do you command, my charming Fairy?\" asked the Falcon,bending his beak in deep reverence (for it mustbe known that, after all, the Lovely Maiden with AzureHair was none other than a very kind Fairy who had lived,for more than a thousand years, in the vicinity of the forest).\n 　　\"Do you see that Marionette hanging from the limbof that giant oak tree?\"\"I see him.\"\"Very well. Fly immediately to him. With yourstrong beak, break the knot which holds him tied, take him down, and lay him softly on the grassat the foot of the oak.\"The Falcon flew away and after two minutes returned,saying, \"I have done what you have commanded.\"\"How did you find him? Alive or dead?\"\"At first glance, I thought he was dead. But I foundI was wrong, for as soon as I loosened the knot aroundhis neck, he gave a long sigh and mumbled with a faintvoice, `Now I feel better!\u0027\"The Fairy clapped her hands twice. A magnificentPoodle appeared, walking on his hind legs just like aman. He was dressed in court livery. A tricorn trimmedwith gold lace was set at a rakish angle over a wig of whitecurls that dropped down to his waist. He wore a jauntycoat of chocolate-colored velvet, with diamond buttons,and with two huge pockets which were always filled withbones, dropped there at dinner by his loving mistress.\n 　　Breeches of crimson velvet, silk stockings, and low,silver-buckled slippers completed his costume. His tailwas encased in a blue silk covering, which was to protectit from the rain.\n 　　\"Come, Medoro,\" said the Fairy to him. \"Get mybest coach ready and set out toward the forest. Onreaching the oak tree, you will find a poor, half-deadMarionette stretched out on the grass. Lift him uptenderly, place him on the silken cushions of the coach,and bring him here to me.\"The Poodle, to show that he understood, wagged his silk-covered tail two or three times and set off at a quick pace.\n 　　In a few minutes, a lovely little coach, made of glass,with lining as soft as whipped cream and chocolate pudding,and stuffed with canary feathers, pulled out of thestable. It was drawn by one hundred pairs of white mice,and the Poodle sat on the coachman\u0027s seat and snappedhis whip gayly in the air, as if he were a real coachmanin a hurry to get to his destination.\n 　　In a quarter of an hour the coach was back. TheFairy, who was waiting at the door of the house, liftedthe poor little Marionette in her arms, took him to adainty room with mother-of-pearl walls, put him to bed,and sent immediately for the most famous doctors of theneighborhood to come to her.\n 　　One after another the doctors came, a Crow, and Owl,and a Talking Cricket.\n 　　\"I should like to know, signori,\" said the Fairy, turningto the three doctors gathered about Pinocchio\u0027s bed,\"I should like to know if this poor Marionette is dead or alive.\"At this invitation, the Crow stepped out and feltPinocchio\u0027s pulse, his nose, his little toe.\n 　　Then he solemnly pronounced the following words:\n 　　\"To my mind this Marionette is dead and gone; but if,by any evil chance, he were not, then that would be asure sign that he is still alive!\"\"I am sorry,\" said the Owl, \"to have to contradict the Crow, my famous friend and colleague. To my mindthis Marionette is alive; but if, by any evil chance, hewere not, then that would be a sure sign that he is wholly dead!\"\"And do you hold any opinion?\" the Fairy asked the Talking Cricket.\n 　　\"I say that a wise doctor, when he does not know what heis talking about, should know enough to keep his mouth shut.\n 　　However, that Marionette is not a stranger to me.\n 　　I have known him a long time!\"Pinocchio, who until then had been very quiet,shuddered so hard that the bed shook.\n 　　\"That Marionette,\" continued the Talking Cricket,\"is a rascal of the worst kind.\"Pinocchio opened his eyes and closed them again.\n 　　\"He is rude, lazy, a runaway.\"Pinocchio hid his face under the sheets.\n 　　\"That Marionette is a disobedient son who is breakinghis father\u0027s heart!\"Long shuddering sobs were heard, cries, and deep sighs.\n 　　Think how surprised everyone was when, on raising the sheets,they discovered Pinocchio half melted in tears!\n 　　\"When the dead weep, they are beginning to recover,\"said the Crow solemnly.\n 　　\"I am sorry to contradict my famous friend and colleague,\" said the Owl, \"but as far as I\u0027m concerned, I think thatwhen the dead weep, it means they do not want to die.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/327/3155.html","bookId":135,"book":{"id":135,"title":"木偶奇遇记 The Adventures of Pinocchio","description":"简介： The Adventures of Pinocchio is a novel for children by Italian author Carlo Collodi, written in Florence.
