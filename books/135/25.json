How did you know it was I?\"she asked, laughing.\n 　　\"My love for you told me who you were.\"\"Do you remember? You left me when I was a little girl and now you find me a grown woman. I am so old, I couldalmost be your mother!\"\"I am very glad of that, for then I can call you motherinstead of sister. For a long time I have wanted a mother,just like other boys. But how did you grow so quickly?\"\"That\u0027s a secret!\"\"Tell it to me. I also want to grow a little. Look at me!\n 　　I have never grown higher than a penny\u0027s worth of cheese.\"\"But you can\u0027t grow,\" answered the Fairy.\n 　　\"Why not?\"\"Because Marionettes never grow. They are born Marionettes,they live Marionettes, and they die Marionettes.\"\"Oh, I\u0027m tired of always being a Marionette!\" cried Pinocchio disgustedly.\n 　　\"It\u0027s about time for me to grow into a man as everyone else does.\"\"And you will if you deserve it--\"\"Really? What can I do to deserve it?\"\"It\u0027s a very simple matter. Try to act like a well-behaved child.\"\"Don\u0027t you think I do?\"\"Far from it! Good boys are obedient, and you, on the contrary--\"\"And I never obey.\"\"Good boys love study and work, but you--\"\"And I, on the contrary, am a lazy fellow and a tramp all year round.\"\"Good boys always tell the truth.\"\"And I always tell lies.\"\"Good boys go gladly to school.\"\"And I get sick if I go to school. From now on I\u0027ll be different.\"\"Do you promise?\"\"I promise. I want to become a good boy and be a comfort to my father.\n 　　Where is my poor father now?\"\"I do not know.\"\"Will I ever be lucky enough to find him and embrace him once more?\"\"I think so. Indeed, I am sure of it.\"At this answer, Pinocchio\u0027s happiness was very great.\n 　　He grasped the Fairy\u0027s hands and kissed them so hard thatit looked as if he had lost his head. Then lifting his face,he looked at her lovingly and asked: \"Tell me, little Mother,it isn\u0027t true that you are dead, is it?\"\"It doesn\u0027t seem so,\" answered the Fairy, smiling.\n 　　\"If you only knew how I suffered and how I wept when I read `Here lies--\u0027\"\"I know it, and for that I have forgiven you. The depth of your sorrow made me see that you have a kind heart.\n 　　There is always hope for boys with hearts such as yours,though they may often be very mischievous. This is thereason why I have come so far to look for you. From nowon, I\u0027ll be your own little mother.\"\"Oh! How lovely!\" cried Pinocchio, jumping with joy.\n 　　\"You will obey me always and do as I wish?\"\"Gladly, very gladly, more than gladly!\"\"Beginning tomorrow,\" said the Fairy, \"you\u0027ll go to school every day.\"Pinocchio\u0027s face fell a little.\n 　　\"Then you will choose the trade you like best.\"Pinocchio became more serious.\n 　　\"What are you mumbling to yourself?\" asked the Fairy.\n 　　\"I was just saying,\" whined the Marionette in a whisper,\"that it seems too late for me to go to school now.\"\"No, indeed. Remember it is never too late to learn.\"\"But I don\u0027t want either trade or profession.\"\"Why?\"\"Because work wearies me!\"\"My dear boy,\" said the Fairy, \"people who speak as you do usually end their days either in a prison or in ahospital. A man, remember, whether rich or poor, shoulddo something in this world. No one can find happinesswithout work. Woe betide the lazy fellow! Laziness is aserious illness and one must cure it immediately; yes, evenfrom early childhood. If not, it will kill you in the end.\"These words touched Pinocchio\u0027s heart. He liftedhis eyes to his Fairy and said seriously:\n 　　\"I\u0027ll work; I\u0027ll study; I\u0027ll do all you tell me.\n 　　After all, the life of a Marionette has grown very tiresometo me and I want to become a boy, no matter how hard it is.\n 　　You promise that, do you not?\"\"Yes, I promise, and now it is up to you.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/327/3164.html","bookId":135,"book":{"id":135,"title":"木偶奇遇记 The Adventures of Pinocchio","description":"简介： The Adventures of Pinocchio is a novel for children by Italian author Carlo Collodi, written in Florence.
