{"id":3969,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"Pinocchio, instead of becoming a boy, runs awayto the Land of Toys with his friend, Lamp-WickComing at last out of the surprise into which the Fairy\u0027swords had thrown him, Pinocchio asked for permission togive out the invitations.\n 　　\"Indeed, you may invite your friends to tomorrow\u0027s party.\n 　　Only remember to return home before dark. Do you understand?\"\"I\u0027ll be back in one hour without fail,\" answered the Marionette.\n 　　\"Take care, Pinocchio! Boys give promises very easily,but they as easily forget them.\"\"But I am not like those others. When I give my word I keep it.\"\"We shall see. In case you do disobey, you will be the oneto suffer, not anyone else.\"\"Why?\"\"Because boys who do not listen to their elders always come to grief.\"\"I certainly have,\" said Pinocchio, \"but from now on, I obey.\"\"We shall see if you are telling the truth.\"Without adding another word, the Marionette bade the goodFairy good-by, and singing and dancing, he left the house.\n 　　In a little more than an hour, all his friends wereinvited. Some accepted quickly and gladly. Others had tobe coaxed, but when they heard that the toast was to bebuttered on both sides, they all ended by acceptingthe invitation with the words, \"We\u0027ll come to please you.\"Now it must be known that, among all his friends,Pinocchio had one whom he loved most of all.\n 　　The boy\u0027s real name was Romeo, but everyone called himLamp-Wick, for he was long and thin and had a woebegonelook about him.\n 　　Lamp-Wick was the laziest boy in the school and thebiggest mischief-maker, but Pinocchio loved him dearly.\n 　　That day, he went straight to his friend\u0027s house to invite himto the party, but Lamp-Wick was not at home. He went a second time,and again a third, but still without success.\n 　　Where could he be? Pinocchio searched here and there and everywhere,and finally discovered him hiding near a farmer\u0027s wagon.\n 　　\"What are you doing there?\" asked Pinocchio, running up to him.\n 　　\"I am waiting for midnight to strike to go--\"\"Where?\"\"Far, far away!\"\"And I have gone to your house three times to look for you!\"\"What did you want from me?\"\"Haven\u0027t you heard the news? Don\u0027t you know what good luck is mine?\"\"What is it?\"\"Tomorrow I end my days as a Marionette and become a boy,like you and all my other friends.\"\"May it bring you luck!\"\"Shall I see you at my party tomorrow?\"\"But I\u0027m telling you that I go tonight.\"\"At what time?\"\"At midnight.\"\"And where are you going?\"\"To a real country--the best in the world--a wonderful place!\"\"What is it called?\"\"It is called the Land of Toys. Why don\u0027t you come, too?\"\"I? Oh, no!\"\"You are making a big mistake, Pinocchio. Believe me,if you don\u0027t come, you\u0027ll be sorry. Where can you finda place that will agree better with you and me? No schools,no teachers, no books! In that blessed place there is nosuch thing as study. Here, it is only on Saturdays thatwe have no school. In the Land of Toys, every day, exceptSunday, is a Saturday. Vacation begins on the firstof January and ends on the last day of December. Thatis the place for me! All countries should be like it!\n 　　How happy we should all be!\"\"But how does one spend the day in the Land of Toys?\"\"Days are spent in play and enjoyment from morn tillnight. At night one goes to bed, and next morning, thegood times begin all over again. What do you think of it?\"\"H\u0027m--!\" said Pinocchio, nodding his wooden head, as if to say,\"It\u0027s the kind of life which would agree with me perfectly.\"\"Do you want to go with me, then? Yes or no? Youmust make up your mind.\"\"No, no, and again no! I have promised my kind Fairyto become a good boy, and I want to keep my word. Justsee: The sun is setting and I must leave you and run.\n 　　Good-by and good luck to you!\"\"Where are you going in such a hurry?\"\"Home. My good Fairy wants me to return home before night.\"\"Wait two minutes more.\"\"It\u0027s too late!\"\"Only two minutes.\"\"And if the Fairy scolds me?\"\"Let her scold. After she gets tired, she will stop,\" said Lamp-Wick.\n 　　\"Are you going alone or with others?\"\"Alone? There will be more than a hundred of us!\"\"Will you walk?\"\"At midnight the wagon passes here that is to take uswithin the boundaries of that marvelous country.\"\"How I wish midnight would strike!\"\"Why?\"\"To see you all set out together.\"\"Stay here a while longer and you will see us!\"\"No, no. I want to return home.\"\"Wait two more minutes.\"\"I have waited too long as it is. The Fairy will be worried.\"\"Poor Fairy! Is she afraid the bats will eat you up?\"\"Listen, Lamp-Wick,\" said the Marionette, \"are youreally sure that there are no schools in the Land of Toys?\"\"Not even the shadow of one.\"\"Not even one teacher?\"\"Not one.\"\"And one does not have to study?\"\"Never, never, never!\"\"What a great land!\" said Pinocchio, feeling his mouth water.\n 　　\"What a beautiful land! I have never been there,but I can well imagine it.\"\"Why don\u0027t you come, too?\"\"It is useless for you to tempt me! I told you I promisedmy good Fairy to behave myself, and I am going tokeep my word.\"\"Good-by, then, and remember me to the grammarschools, to the high schools, and even to the colleges ifyou meet them on the way.\"\"Good-by, Lamp-Wick. Have a pleasant trip, enjoyyourself, and remember your friends once in a while.\"With these words, the Marionette started on his wayhome. Turning once more to his friend, he asked him:\n 　　\"But are you sure that, in that country, each week iscomposed of six Saturdays and one Sunday?\"\"Very sure!\"\"And that vacation begins on the first of January andends on the thirty-first of December?\"\"Very, very sure!\"\"What a great country!\" repeated Pinocchio, puzzledas to what to do.\n 　　Then, in sudden determination, he said hurriedly:\n 　　\"Good-by for the last time, and good luck.\"\"Good-by.\"\"How soon will you go?\"\"Within two hours.\"\"What a pity! If it were only one hour, I might wait for you.\"\"And the Fairy?\"\"By this time I\u0027m late, and one hour more or less makesvery little difference.\"\"Poor Pinocchio! And if the Fairy scolds you?\"\"Oh, I\u0027ll let her scold. After she gets tired, she will stop.\"In the meantime, the night became darker and darker.\n 　　All at once in the distance a small light flickered. Aqueer sound could be heard, soft as a little bell, and faintand muffled like the buzz of a far-away mosquito.\n 　　\"There it is!\" cried Lamp-Wick, jumping to his feet.\n 　　\"What?\" whispered Pinocchio.\n 　　\"The wagon which is coming to get me. For the lasttime, are you coming or not?\"\"But is it really true that in that country boys neverhave to study?\"\"Never, never, never!\"\"What a wonderful, beautiful, marvelous country! Oh--h--h!!\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/327/3169.html","bookId":135,"book":{"id":135,"title":"木偶奇遇记 The Adventures of Pinocchio","description":"简介： The Adventures of Pinocchio is a novel for children by Italian author Carlo Collodi, written in Florence.
