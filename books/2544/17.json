Then he remembered and his heart seemed to stop. With a startled grunt, he jolted up to a sitting position and looked around incredulously, his mind alive with one word:\\n\\n Where?\\n\\n He looked up at the sky, but there was no sky, only a ragged blueness, as if the sky had been torn and stretched and squeezed and poked full of giant holes, through which light speared. His wide, unblinking gaze moved slowly, wonderingly. He seemed to be in a vast, endless cavern. Not far over to his right the cavern ended and there was light. He stood up hastily and found himself naked. Where was the sponge?\\n\\n He looked up again at the jagged blue dome. It stretched away for hundreds of yards. It was the bit of sponge he\u0027d worn.\\n\\n He sat down heavily, looking over himself. He was the same. He touched himself. Yes, the same. But how much had he shrunk during the night?\\n\\n He remembered lying on the bed of leaves the night before, and he glanced down. He was sitting on a vast plain of speckled brown and yellow. There were great paths angling out from a gigantic avenue. They went as far as he could see.\\n\\n He was sitting on the leaves.\\n\\n He shook his head in confusion.\\n\\n How could he be less than nothing?\\n\\n The idea came. Last night he\u0027d looked up at the universe without. Then there must be a universe within, too. Maybe universes.\\n\\n He stood again. Why had he never thought of it; of the microscopic and the submicroscopic worlds?\\n\\n That they existed he had always known. Yet never had he made the obvious connection. He\u0027d always thought in terms of man\u0027s own world and man\u0027s own limited dimensions. He had presumed upon nature. For the inch was man\u0027s concept, not nature\u0027s. To a man, zero inches meant nothing. Zero meant nothing. But to nature there was no zero. Existence went on in endless cycles. It seemed so simple now. He would never disappear, because there was no point of non-existence in the universe. It frightened him at first. The idea of going on endlessly through one level of dimension after another was alien.\\n\\n Then he thought: If nature existed on endless levels, so also might intelligence. He might not have to be alone.\\n\\n Suddenly he began running toward the light.\\n\\n And, when he\u0027d reached it, he stood in speechless awe looking at the new world with its vivid splashes of vegetation, its scintillate hills, its towering trees, its sky of shifting hues, as though the sunlight were being filtered through moving layers of pastel glass.\\n\\n It was a wonderland.\\n\\n There was much to be done and more to be thought about. His brain was teeming with questions and ideas and yes, hope again. There was food to be found, water, clothing, shelter. And, most important, life. Who knew? It might be, it just might be there.\\n\\n Scott Carey ran into his new world, searching.\\n\\n The End \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-incredible-shrinking-man/page-17.html","bookId":2544,"book":{"id":2544,"title":"The Incredible Shrinking Man","description":"Storyline: While on holiday, Scott Carey is exposed to a cloud of radioactive spray shortly after he accidentally ingests insecticide. The radioactivity acts as a catalyst for the bug spray, causing his body to shrink at a rate of approximately 1/7 of an inch per day. A few weeks later, Carey can no longer deny the truth: not only is he losing weight, he is also shorter than he was and deduces, to his dismay, that his body will continue to shrink.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-incredible-shrinking-man.jpg","author":"Richard Matheson","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-incredible-shrinking-man.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:51 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:05:35 AM"}}
