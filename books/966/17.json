{"id":38732,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. COUNTERCHECK.","content":"Mr. Effingham began to think that the position of affairs was growing serious. A month had elapsed since his interview with old Mr. Lyons at the Net of Lemons, and he had not gained one scrap of information as to the whereabouts of the holder of the forged bill, which was to be held in terrorem over Sir Charles Mitford for money-extracting purposes, and which was finally to be given up for an enormous round sum. Not a single scrap; and worse than all, he had so devoted himself to this one scent, that his other chances of money-getting were falling into disuse. Not that there was much to be done elsewhere; it was the off-racing season, so that his trade of tipster and tout, with occasional sallies into the arena of welching, could not have been turned to very profitable purpose. The Bank authorities had lately been terribly wideawake; several packets of slippery greasy half-crowns, and many rolls of soft sleezy bank-notes, lay hid in their manufacturer\u0027s and engraver\u0027s workshops, waiting a better time for their circulation. There had been some notable burglaries both in town and country. Gentlemen with blackened faces who wore smock-frocks over their ordinary clothes had done some very creditable work in out-of-the-way mansions and London houses whose owners were entertaining company in the country, and the melting-pots of old Mr. Lyons and others of his fraternity were rarely off the fire. But this branch of trade was entirely out of Mr. Effingham\u0027s line. \"He\u0027s a good \u0027un at passing a half-bull or at spinning a flash fiver. There\u0027s a air about him that goes down uncommon. He\u0027s fust-rate for that, is D\u0027Ossay Butler; but as rank a little cur as ever waddled. When he thinks traps is on, he\u0027s off; and as to my cracksman\u0027s business, or anything where pluck\u0027s wanted, Lor\u0027 bless you, you might as well have a girl in highstrikes as D\u0027Ossay.\" That was what his companions said of him, and it was pretty nearly true. Where a little swaggering bantam-cock demeanour was of use, D\u0027Ossay succeeded; but where anything like physical courage or physical force was required, he was no good at all. When the lion is on short commons, the jackal is generally in a very bad way. If Mr. D\u0027Ossay Butler was hard up, the condition of tall-hatted Mr. Griffiths was necessarily frightful. That worthy member of society was financially at the lowest ebb, and had resorted to a trade which he reserved for the depths of despair, a mild cardsharping--a \"three, two, and vun\" game, in which it was an impossibility for the bystander to point out the exact position of the king--at low public-houses. During all his wanderings, however, he kept his eyes open to the necessity of obeying his instructions from D\u0027Ossay Butler, to the necessity of discovering the whereabouts of Lizzy Ponsford, the holder of the bill. There was no slum that he visited; no public-house, where he first propitiated the landlord by the purchase of half-a-pint of ale, and then proceeded to suggest to the notice of the two or three sawney-looking men at the bar a \"curous little game he had there, at which \u0027atfuls of money had been von, and which was the favourite recreation of the horficers of the Queen\u0027s Life-Guards at the Windsor Barracks, where he\u0027d \u0027ad the pleasure of introducin\u0027 it \u0027imself;\" no pedestrian ground, no penny-gaff, where he did not get into conversation with somebody connected with the premises, and try to worm out that all-important secret. But all was of no avail. Many of the persons he spoke to knew or had heard of Tony Butler, and paid many handsome compliments to the deceased--\"a vide-avake vun and no mistake,\" \"a feller as vould take your coat off your back on to his own,\" \u0026c.; but very few had known Lizzie Ponsford, and those had not seen or heard of her for a considerable time. So Mr. Griffiths began to keep clear of Mr. Effingham. There was nothing to be got from his employer but abuse, and that was an article of which Mr. Griffiths perhaps had a surfeit, especially after he had picked up a few stray eighteenpences from the frequenters of the Pig and Whistle, at the noble game of the \"three, two, and vun.\" But one night, finding himself in the neighbourhood of the Strand, and having had rather a successful evening,--he had won fifteen shillings from a sailor, at a public-house in Thames Street; a sailor who paid him rigidly, and then cursed him for an adjective swab and kicked him into the street,--Mr. Griffiths thought he would take a little refreshment at Johnson\u0027s. On presenting the crown of his hat within the swing-doors, that article was immediately recognized by Mr. Effingham, seated moodily in the nearest box, and its owner hailed in the nearest approach to a voice of thunder which that small gentleman could accomplish. \"Come in; I see you!\" called out the little man. \"I\u0027ve been wondering what had become of you all this time. I thought you\u0027d gone to stay with some swell in the country for the hunting-season. I was goin\u0027 to ask if they had got your address at the Morning-Post office, that I might write you a line and see if you could find it convenient to lend me a trifle.\" \"You must be in luck to have such spirits, D\u0027Ossay,--you must,\" said Mr. Griffiths sententiously. \"Out of collar and out at elbows--that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been out of. Look at my coat,\" pointing to his arms; \"shining like bees-wax. Look at my crabshells,\" pointing to his boots; \"as leaky as an old punt, reg\u0027larly wore down to the sewin\u0027, and all through elberin\u0027 and cadgin\u0027 my way into every crib where I thought there was a chance of my comin\u0027 at what we wanted to know.\" \"And what good have you done with all that tremenduous exertion?\" \"No good,--not a scrap. I suppose you\u0027ve been at the same game? How have you got on?\" \"About the same as you have. Just as \u0027ealthy my lookout is.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you what I intend to do. I\u0027ve worked high and low, here and there, like a blessed black slave, to find out where this gal is, and I\u0027ve had no luck no more than you have. And I intend to cut it. I\u0027m sick of all this dodgin\u0027 and divin\u0027, and askin\u0027 everybody after somebody that nobody knows. I intend to cut it. That\u0027s what I intend!\" \"And let it go altogether, after all the trouble we\u0027ve had; after-- Not such a flat, Griffiths; don\u0027t you fear. Look here, my boy,\" said Mr. Butler, putting his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, and producing therefrom two sovereigns; \"do you see that couple of quid? That, with a shilling and a fourpenny bit, is all that remains to your friend D\u0027Ossay of the current coin of this realm--the real business, I mean, and no fakement. But these two simple skivs shall be turned into fifty or a hundred before the end of the week. And to show you that I\u0027m not boasting, I\u0027ll stand a drink. Here, waiter!--brandy hot, two!\" Mr. Griffiths gazed in double admiration at his friend\u0027s generosity and pluck; but low as he was, he really admired the latter, from which he might possibly derive ultimate benefit, more than the former, from which he was about to receive immediate advantage. After the first sip of his grog he said-- \"And how\u0027s it coming off?\" \"I don\u0027t mind telling you,\" said D\u0027Ossay. \"There\u0027s nothing to hide--why should there be? I\u0027m going to try it on again with our friend the Bart.\" \"Without the bill?\" \"Of course, without the bill, considering that neither you nor I have been able to get hold of it. But didn\u0027t I raise a fiftier out of him without the bill before, and why shouldn\u0027t I do that, or double that, now?\" \"Ah, why indeed?\" said Mr. Griffiths, who always coincided when he did not know what else to do, and there was nothing to lose by so doing. \"You see, I thought he might down upon me with the extortion dodge, and hand me over to a bobby. But there\u0027s no bobbies where he is now; he couldn\u0027t ring the bell and send out that sleek-looking vally, and have me in Vine Street in a brace of shakes. He\u0027s down in the country ever so far away. I called at Eaton Place to-day, and they gave me his address.\" \"And how do you mean to get at him? Not by writin\u0027? Don\u0027t trust your fist on paper.\" \"Teach your grandmother, Griffiths! How do I mean to get at him? Why, by paying one of those yellow-boys to a booking-clerk at 6.30 to-morrow morning, and going down by the Great-Western parliamentary to Torquay, which is close by the swell\u0027s place.\" \"And then?\" \"Then I shall put up at some quiet crib, and go over the next morning and take him on the bounce--just as I did before.\" \"And suppose he shows fight and won\u0027t part?\" \"Then I must send up a line to you, and you must get up a friendly lead, or something of that kind, and work me back to town.\" \"And you\u0027ll chance all that?\" \"I\u0027d chance a mile more than that for such stakes, where there\u0027s no knockin\u0027 about or head-punchin\u0027 business, Griffiths. I\u0027ve not got what they call animal courage, which means I don\u0027t like being hurt. Some people do, I suppose, and they have animal courage. Now, let\u0027s settle where I\u0027m to write to you, and all the rest of the business.\" Mr. Effingham spoke thus cheerily, and seemed thoroughly determined on his undertaking and confident of his success, as he sat, late at night, in a warm brilliantly-lit tavern-parlour, with the odours of tobacco and hot spirituous drinks fragrant to him floating pleasantly about. He took quite another view of the subject when he turned out between five and six the next morning into a bald blank street, swept by torrents of rain, in which no one was visible but the policeman and the few vagrants huddling round the early-breakfast stall at the corner. Mr. Effingham wrapped himself up as best he might in his fifteen-shilling pea-jacket, and under cover of a big gingham umbrella, borrowed from his landlady, made the best fight he could against the wind and the rain, which, however, had so far the best of it that he was tolerably damp by the time he reached the Paddington station. He took his ticket, and seated himself on the shelf in one of those wooden boxes which benevolent railway directors set aside for the conveyance of parliamentarians. His companions were two navvies, who had not slept off the effects of last night\u0027s drunkenness, and whose language made Mr. Effingham--albeit not unused to listening to \"tall talk\"--shrink with disgust; an old woman with steaming black garments, and an umbrella which would not stand up in any corner and would not lie under the seat, and got itself called most opprobrious names for its persistence in leaning against the nearest navvy; and a young woman with a swollen face tied up in a check cotton handkerchief. Mr. Effingham made an effort to let the very small window on his side down, but the young woman with the toothache had it up in an instant; while the aperture on the other side was constantly stuffed with the body of one or other of the drunken navvies, who fought for the privilege of leaning half out of the carriage, and running the chance of being knocked to pieces against arches and tunnel-walls. So the navvies fought and swore, and the old woman sniffed and took little snatches of sleep, waking with a prolonged snort and start; and the young woman moaned and rubbed her face, until Mr. Effingham was nearly mad. Circumstances were almost too much for him; he grew first desponding, and then desperate. He wished he had never started on his journey; he would get out at the next station at which the train stopped (and as the parliamentary duly stopped at every station, he would not have had to wait long); he would go back to London. No, he would not do that; he had boasted about his intention to Griffiths, and would lose all authority over that satellite if he did not show at least the semblance of a fulfilment of his purpose. He would get out at the next station, and wait at a public-house in the village until the next day, and then go back and tell Griffiths he had seen Sir Charles Mitford, and had found it impossible to get any money out of him. And then, just as the whistle shrieked out and the engine reduced its particularly slow pace to a slower still, preparatory to pulling up, Mr. Effingham\u0027s hands strayed into his waistcoat-pocket, where he found only a half-sovereign and a few shillings remaining--the extent of his earthly possessions. That decided him; he would go on, come what might! Such a state of impecuniosity nerved him to anything; and--the absence of policemen in rural districts still pleasantly remembered--he determined upon pursuing his original idea and of continuing his journey. The next day Sir Charles Mitford, who had been compelled to devote the morning to dry details of business connected with his estate--details to which he listened conscientiously, over which he shook his head visibly, and which he did not in the least understand--had got rid of the man of business from the library about noon, and was just thinking he would go and see what Mrs. Hammond was doing, when Banks entered, and closing the door after him in a secret and mysterious manner, announced \"That party, sir.\" \"What \u0027party,\u0027 Banks?\" \"The party that called in Heaton Place, Sir Charles, and ast to see you, and you wouldn\u0027t see at first, but did afterwards, Sir Charles.\" \"I don\u0027t know yet whom you mean, Banks.\" \"The naval party, Sir Charles; though lookin\u0027 more like after the coats and humbrellas in the \u0027all. The naval party as served with you on board some ship, Sir Charles.\" \"Oh,\" said Mitford hurriedly, \"I recollect now; one of--one of my sailors from my old yacht--yes, yes, of course. You can show him into my own room, Banks. I\u0027ll go up there at once.\" \"\u0027Sailor,\u0027\" said Mr. Banks to himself as he walked down the passage, \"\u0027from my hold yacht,\u0027 did he say? Why, if what they say at the Club is right, the honly naval concern which he knew of before comin\u0027 in for the title was the Fleet Pris\u0027n! This is a queer start about this feller, this is. I wonder why he wants to see Mitford, and why Mitford can\u0027t refuse hisself to him?--This way, young man.\" And he beckoned haughtily to Mr. Effingham, and preceded him to his master\u0027s room. Sir Charles had already arrived there, and was seated in his large armchair when the visitor was shown in. Ah, what a different visitor from the Mr. Effingham who called in Eaton Place! Then full of vulgar confidence and brazen audacity; now, flinching, slouching, cowardly. His dress bedraggled from the previous day\u0027s wretched journey, his manner downcast from the preconceived notion of failure in his mission, and the impossibility of enforcing his previous demands. A very wretched specimen of humanity was Mr. Effingham as he stood before Sir Charles Mitford, shifting his limp hat from hand to hand, and waiting to be asked to sit down. When Banks had retired and closed the door, Sir Charles looked up quietly and steadily at his visitor, and said, \"Well, Mr.--I forget your name--you\u0027ve broken your promise, as I expected, and come to try and extort money from me again!\" \"Extort, Sir Charles! that\u0027s not the word, sir; I--\" \"That is the word, sir! Sheer barefaced robbery and extortion--that\u0027s what has brought you down here; deny it if you can! Have you come to ask me for money, or have you not?\" \"Well, Sir Charles, I--that is--\" \"No shuffling, sir! no prevarication! Have you or not?\" \"Well, suppose I have?\" \"Suppose you have! And suppose that I, as a justice of the peace and magistrate for the county, make out a warrant for your committal to prison as a rogue and vagabond? We\u0027re a long way from London, and justice\u0027s law is to be had down in these parts. Besides, how could you appeal? to whom could you refer? I\u0027ve made a point of having a few inquiries made about you since you last did me the honour of a call, and I find that if not a regular gaol-bird, you could at all events be recognized by the police as a swindler and an utterer of base coin. What do you think of that Mr.--Butler?\" What did he think of it? The realization of his worst fears, the overthrow of his strongest hopes! He ought to have relied on the presentiment which had told him that the man would take this course, though not so promptly or so strongly. He thought he would try one more bit of bounce, and he shook himself together and put as much impudence as he could command into his look as he said, \"How do you know I\u0027ve not got that forged bill in my pocket?\" \"By your face, sir! I can see that as plainly as if it were written there in big black letters! Ah, I knew I was right! Now, what have you got to say to this, Mr. Butler?\" Mr. Effingham fairly collapsed. \"Nothing, Sir Charles,\" he stammered. \"I\u0027ve nothing to say-only have mercy, Sir Charles! I have not brought the bill with me, but I know where it is, and could lay my hand on it at any time, Sir Charles. And as to what you said about committing me as a rogue and a vagabond, O Lord! don\u0027t do it, Sir Charles! pray don\u0027t! I\u0027m a poor miserable devil without a rap; but if you\u0027ll only let me go, I\u0027ll find my way back to town, and never intrude on you again, Sir Charles; I--\" All this time Mr. Effingham had been backing, and with his hand behind him feeling for the handle of the door. Having secured it, he was about to vanish, when Sir Charles called out to him \"Stop!\" and he stopped at once. \"You say you\u0027re hard-up, Mr. Butler?\" \"I\u0027m positively stumped, Sir Charles.\" \"Then you\u0027d be glad to earn a little money?\" \"If I could do so--\" Mr. Effingham was about to say \"honestly,\" but he thought this would be a little too glaring, so he finished his sentence by substituting \"without incurring any danger, I should be delighted.\" \"There would not be the slightest danger--\" \"By danger I mean, punching of heads and that kind of thing.\" \"Precisely; there would be nothing of that. The only person with whom you would be brought into contact would be a woman.\" Mr. Effingham\u0027s barometrical mercury rose as quickly as it fell. \"A woman!\" he said, as he settled his limp collar and gave a pull at his dirty wristbands,--\"a woman, Sir Charles! Oh, then, I\u0027ve no fear.\" \"Wait and hear what you\u0027re required to do, sir, before you give an opinion. The person to whom I allude is at the present moment in this house. She is therefore, although not invited by me, to a certain extent my guest, and it would be impossible for me to appear in the matter. You comprehend me?\" \"Perfectly.\" \"Especially as she is to be got rid of at once and for ever. When I say \u0027got rid of,\u0027 I don\u0027t mean it in the slang phrase of the penny romances--I don\u0027t mean that the woman is to be killed; but simply that she is to be told that she must remain here no longer, and the danger of doing so must be strongly pointed out to her.\" \"Exactly, je twig! Now will you please to tell me the name of this good lady, and what reason I\u0027m to give for insisting on her leaving such a very swell and pleasant crib as this appears to be?\" \"She is called here Miss Gillespie,\" said Sir Charles; \"but You will have heard of her under a very different name--Lizzie Ponsford.\" \"What!\" exclaimed Mr. Effingham, leaping from his chair; \"Lizzie Ponsford here! She whom I\u0027ve been--\" \"Well, sir?\" asked Sir Charles in astonishment. \"Whom I\u0027ve been hearing so much about!\" said Mr. Effingham, recovering himself. \"Lizzie Ponsford here!\" he continued, going off again. \"Well, that is a rum start!\" \"Be good enough to attend to me, sir. She is here, and she is in my way. Her presence worries me, bringing back all sorts of hideous associations that I thought I had got rid of, and never want to have revived. You must see her, talk to her, and get her to go at once; once gone, I could so arrange matters as to leave little chance of her returning.\" \"I see!\" said Mr. Effingham. \"Now the question is, how to work her out of this. What would be the best way to frighten her and get her under your thumb?\" \"What is your notion on that point?\" \"I scarcely know yet! It will want a little thinking over, but I\u0027ve no doubt I shall be able to hit upon something. Is she pretty comfortable where she is--likely not to give it up without a struggle?\" \"You may take your oath she will not move unless compelled--it is for you to find the something that will compel her.\" \"Exactly. Well, I don\u0027t think that there will be much difficulty about that--at least,\" said he, correcting himself, for he feared that comparative facility might lessen the reward--\"at least, not much difficulty for a man whose head\u0027s screwed on the right way. Now about the payment?\" Sir Charles opened a drawer in his desk, and from a little rouleau of gold counted out ten sovereigns. The chink of the money sounded deliciously in Mr. Effingham\u0027s hungry ears. \"I will give you these ten sovereigns now,\" said Sir Charles; \"and if you succeed in carrying out all I have told you, I will give you fifty more.\" \"Will you? Well, I always say what I think, and I say that\u0027s liberal. Now look here! Very likely I shan\u0027t see you again; perhaps I shall have to step it with her, in order to be sure she\u0027s safe off, and not dodging, or likely to walk back again. So when you find she\u0027s really gone, just you send a cheque for the fifty, made payable to bearer, mind, and not crossed, to this address;\" and bending down over the table he took a pen and scrap of paper and wrote: Mr. Effingham, Mr. Johnson\u0027s, The Brown Bear, Shakespeare Street, Strand, London. \"Will you do that?\" \"I will.\" \"Having said so as an honourable gent, I know you\u0027ll keep your word. Now how am I to see her?\" \"She walks out every day at three o\u0027clock with her pupil--\" \"Her pupil! Lizzie Ponsford\u0027s pupil! My eye!\" \"With her pupil,\" repeated Sir Charles sternly, \"in the chestnut avenue leading from the lodge-gate. A tall woman with very large eyes, and crisp wavy °hair over her forehead; a peculiar-looking woman--you couldn\u0027t mistake her.\" \"All right! As I go out of the lodge-gate now, I\u0027ll just say a few words to the old lady that keeps it, that she may know me again--don\u0027t you see?--and not be surprised at my coming in and out. And now, as I shall probably have to hang about here for two or three days, where can I put up?\" \"You mustn\u0027t remain here in the house--\" \"Lor\u0027 bless you, that would never do! isn\u0027t there a public near?\" \"There is the Mitford Arms, within a quarter of a mile of the lodge.\" \"I saw it; the carrier\u0027s-cart which brought me over from Torquay stopped there. That\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll be a littery gent gettin\u0027 up information about the old county families, or an artist sketchin\u0027--that\u0027ll do. Now give me a week clear: if nothing\u0027s done by then, you\u0027ll have spent ten pound very badly, and I shall have lost my time. But if within that time--and it might be to-morrow or any day--you find she\u0027s clean gone, you\u0027ve got the address, and you\u0027ll send the cheque to it?\" \"You may rely on me.\" \"I do thoroughly. Now how am I to get out? It wouldn\u0027t do for you to be seen with me--my togs, though just the sort of thing for the littery gent, ain\u0027t very swell.\" \"You can go down this staircase,\" said Sir Charles, leading him to a landing; \"it guides on to the garden, take the first to the right, and you\u0027ll come at last to the avenue.\" Mr. Effingham put his finger to the limp brim of his hat and departed. But when he arrived in the chestnut avenue, and had looked carefully round, and found that he was out of sight of any one in the house, and that there was no one near enough to observe his conduct, he rubbed his hands together, and almost cut a caper in the air with delight. \"To think of it!\" he said. \"There never, never was such luck! D\u0027Ossay, my boy, you\u0027ve got the trick of it somehow. What will Griffiths say now? To think that I\u0027ve been hunting for this woman all this time, and that she\u0027s now placed in my hands--and by this very swell too! Two birds with one stone now. Oh, there\u0027s a much bigger game than the Bart.\u0027s cheque for fifty! But it\u0027ll take a deal of thinking over and planning; and if there\u0027s any one to do that, it\u0027s you, D\u0027Ossay, my boy, and no one else!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3078/85025.html","bookId":966,"book":{"id":966,"title":"Running the Gauntlet","description":"简介： Throughout the length and breadth of this London of ours there were few legal firms, no matter of how old standing, doing a better, larger ready-money business than that of Moss and Moss of Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane.
