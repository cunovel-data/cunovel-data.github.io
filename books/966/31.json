{"id":38746,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI. AMONG THE SPRINGS.","content":"It was the month of September, and the little town of Baden was full. It is now the big town of Baden, and is still, during its season, filled to overflowing; but the company is by no means so select, so pleasant, so agreeable as it used to be. The vor-eisenbahn Baden was as superior to the present excursionists\u0027 resort as was the ante-railway Ascot Meeting to what now is merely a succession of Derby-days in Bucks. Then, when you posted in from Strasburg, or arrived in the eilwagen, from deadly-lively Carlsruhe, you found Mr. Rheinboldt, the landlord of the Badischer Hof, attended by the stoutest, the best-tempered, and the stupidest even of German porters, coming forward to meet you with the pleasantest of greetings. You had written on beforehand if you were a wise man, and your old room was ready--one of that little row of snug dormitories set apart for bachelors, and looking on to the trim garden. You had a wash, with more water than you had met with since you left home (they were beginning to understand the English mania for soap-and-water at the Badischer Hof even so long ago), and you made your toilette and came down to the five-o\u0027clock table-d\u0027h?te, where you found most of the people who had been there the previous season, and many of their friends whom they had induced to come. Most of the people knew each other or of each other, and there was a sociability among them which the railway has utterly annihilated. Now London sends her bagmen and Paris her lorettes; but in those days, if \"our Mr. Johnson\" got as far as Parry by way of Cally or Bolong, he was looked upon as an intrepid voyager, while very few Parisian ladies, save those of the best class, came into the Grand Duke\u0027s territory. It was hot in England in that September, but it was hotter at Baden. With the earliest dawn came thick vapours rolling down from the Black Forest, encompassing the little town with a white and misty shroud, which invariably presaged a sultry day, and invariably kept its promise. All day long the big red-faced sun glared down upon the denizens of the pleasantest corner of Vanity Fair; glared in the early morning upon the water-drinkers sipping the nauseous fluid in the thick and heavy glass tumblers, and tendering their kreutzers to the attendant maidens at the Brunnen; glared upon them as they took the prescribed constitutional walk, and returned to the hotel to breakfast; glared upon the fevered gamblers, who, with last night\u0027s excitement only half slept off, with bleared eyes and shaking hands and parched throats, took their places round the gaming-table as the clock struck noon, and eyed the stolid-faced croupiers as intently as though the chances of the game were to be gleamed from a perusal of their fishy eyes or pursed mouths. The revellers who were starting off for picnics to the Black Forest, or excursions to the Favourite or Eberstein-Schloss, glanced up with terror at the scorching red ball in the sky, and bade courteous Mr. Rheinboldt, the landlord of the Badischer Hof, to see that plenty of ice was packed with the sparkling Moselle, and to let Karl and Fritz take care that an unlimited supply of umbrellas was placed in the carriage. The Englishmen, whom M. Benazet, the proprietor of the gaming-tables, grateful for their patronage, had provided with shooting, or who had received invitations to the triebjagd of some neighbouring landowner, looked with comic wonder, not unmixed with horror, at the green jerkins, fantastic game-bags, couteaux de chasse or hunting-knives (worn in the belt), and general appearance of their foreign friends; and then when lunch-time arrived, and they saw each German eating his own sausage and drinking from his own particular flask, which he never dreamed of passing, they recollected with dismay the luncheons at similar parties in England, the snowy cloth laid under the shade of the hedge, the luscious game-pie, the cooling claret-cup, the glancing eyes and natty ankles of those who had accompanied the luncheon. Hot! It was no word for it. It was blazing, tearing, drying, baking, scorching heat, and it was hotter at Baden than anywhere else. So they said at least, and as they were from almost every part of the civilized world, they ought to have known. There were English people, swells, peers and peeresses, bankers and bankeresses, a neat little legal set,--Sir Nisey and Lady Prious, Mr. Tocsin, Q.C., Mr. Serjeant Stentor, and some of the junior members of the bar,--a select assortment of the Stock-Exchange, and some eligible young men from the West-end government offices. There were joyous Russians, whose names all ended in \"vitch\" and \"gorod,\" and were otherwise utterly unpronounceable, who spoke all European languages with equal fluency and facility, and who put down rouleaux of Napoleons on the roulette-table where other people staked thalers or florins. There were a few Frenchmen and French ladies; here was an Austrian gross-herzog or grand-duke, there some Prussian cavalry subalterns who could not play at the table because they had spent the half-crown of their daily allowance in roast veal, Bairisch beer, and a horrible compound called \"grogs an rhum,\" which they drank at night, \"after,\" as they said to themselves, \"the English fashion.\" It had been hotter than ever during the day, but the day was happily past and over, and the moon was streaming on the broad gravelled Platz in front of the Conversationshaus, and the band, stationed in the little oil-lamp-illumined kiosk, were rattling away at Strauss\u0027s waltzes and Labitskey\u0027s galops. The gamblers were already thronging the roulette and trente-et-quarante tables; and of the non-gamblers all such as had ladies with them were promenading and listening to the music, while the others were seated, drinking and smoking. It was a splendid evening; the diners at the late tables-d\u0027h?te were wending their way from their hotels to the promenade; the consumers of the German mittagsessen, were listening to the band in delicious anticipation of the reh-braten and the haring-salad and the bok-bier, or the Ahrbleichart, at which another half-hour would see them hard at work; the clamouring for coffee was incessant, and the head-waiter, Joseph, who was so like Bouffé, was almost driven out of his wits by the Babel of voices. They chattered, those tall occupants of the little wooden round-tables--how they chattered! They turned round and stared at the promenaders, and made their comments on them after they had passed. They had something to say, some remark, either complimentary or disparaging, to make upon all the ladies. But there was only one man who seemed to attract any special attention, and that was the Russian Prince Tchernigow. A man of middle height, with brown-black hair, a perfectly bloodless complexion, stern deeply sunken eyes, a stiff moustache bristling over a determined mouth. A man with small hands and feet, and apparently but little muscular development, but strong, brave, and vindictive. A man whose face Lavater might have studied for months without getting beyond the merest rudiments of his science--impassive, unaltering, statuesque. He never played but with rouleaux of napoleons--twenty in a rouleau; and though the space in front of him was shining with gold at one moment, or laid bare by the sweeping rake of the croupier,--winning or losing, his expression would not change for an instant. He had been to Baden for two or three seasons running, and was beginning to be looked upon as an habitué; the croupiers acknowledged his taking his seat, intending to do battle, by a slight grave bow; he had broken the bank more than once, and was a lion among the visitors, and notably amongst the English. Tchernigow\u0027s horses and carriages, his bold play, his good shooting, the wonderful way in which he spoke our language, his love of solitude, his taciturnity, his singular physique, were all freely discussed at the late tables-d\u0027h?te of hotels at which the prince was not staving. His reputation of beau joueur caused him to be followed as soon as he was seen going into the rooms, and his play was watched and humbly imitated by scores. He seldom attended the balls, and very rarely danced, though he valsed to perfection; and all the women in the room were eager for his selection. His appearance on the promenade always excited attention, but he never gave the smallest sign of having observed it. Among those who looked up as Prince Tchernigow passed was Lord Dollamore, who was seated at one of the tables, with no companion save his invariable one--his stick. Dollamore generally came to Baden every year. The place amused him; it was a grand field for the display of the worst passions of human nature,--a study which always afforded him infinite delight. He never played, but he was constantly hovering round the tables; and there was scarcely an incident which happened in the seething crowd, scarcely a change which swept across the faces of the leading actors, that passed unnoticed by him. He did not dance; he would have been prevented by his lameness from indulging in such a pastime, even had his taste impelled him to it; but he was a constant attendant at the balls which M. Benazet provided for the amusement of his patrons; and looking on at the actual life before him as he might have looked on the mimic life of a theatrical representation, he had innumerable conferences with his stick on all he saw and heard, and on the arguments which he deduced therefrom. He immensely enjoyed being seated, as he was then, in the calm autumnal moonlit evening, with a cup of excellent coffee by his side, a cigar in his mouth, and the ever-shifting panorama of human faces passing before him. \"That Tchernigow is really delicious!\" he said to himself--or to his stick--as he looked after the Russian, and marked the excitement which he created; \"there\u0027s a savage insolence about him which is positively refreshing in these days of bowing and scraping and preposterous politeness. How they chatter, and gape, and nudge each other with their elbows about him! and what a supreme indifference he affects to it all! Affects? Yes, mon prince, it is accepted as the real thing by these good people, but we are not to be taken in by veneer, nous autres! It would require a very small scratch indeed to pick off the Petersburg-cum-Paris polish, and to arrive at the genuine Calmuck substratum. Only to look at you to tell that Nature\u0027s handwriting never lies; and if ever there were a more delightfully truculent, ruffianly, bloodthirsty savage than yourself, mon prince, I am very much out in my ideas. God help the woman on whom you ever get a legitimate hold! Ah, that reminds me--what has become of the widow? There is no doubt that Tchernigow was badly hit in London. The only man received at her house, the only man permitted to assuage her grief, to wipe away those tears which doubtless flowed so constantly for poor Percy Hammond! What an audacious little devil it is! How pluckily she fought that business of guardianship to the child; and how gracefully she retired from the contest when she saw that she had no chance, and that defeat was inevitable! She\u0027s the cleverest woman, in a certain way, that I\u0027ve ever met with; and I\u0027d take my oath she\u0027s playing some long-headed, far-sighted game now, and that Tchernigow is the stake. No more flirtation and coquetry--for the present--les eaux sont bases; the widow is hard up, and means to recoup herself by a rich marriage. That\u0027s why that infatuated cad Mitford was snubbed so severely. I think she comprehends that Tchernigow will stand no nonsense, and as he is the parti at present in view, his will is law. She can\u0027t have given up the chase; but how on earth is she working it?\" A smart natty-looking little man in evening-dress, with smoothly-brushed hair and elaborately-trimmed whiskers, faint pink coral studs, little jean boots with glazed tips, irreproachable gloves, and a Gibus hat--a little man who looked as if he had just stepped out of a bandbox--stopped at Lord Dollamore\u0027s table, and with a bow, half-deferential, half-familiar, glided into the vacant chair. \"Ah, how do you do, Mr. Aldermaston?\" said Lord Dollamore, looking up,--\"how do you do? and what is the latest news in this Inferno?\" Every one who knew Mr. Aldermaston made a point of asking him the news, well knowing that they could apply to no better source for the latest gossip and tittle-tattle. Mr. Aldermaston nominally was private secretary to Lord Waterhouse, the First Commissioner at the Inland, Irrigation Office, and he had been selected for that onerous post for his distinguished personal appearance and his obsequious toadyism. It was not a situation involving a great deal of work, though any one noticing the regularity with which a large leather despatch-box, bearing a gilt crown, and \"Charles Aldermaston, Esq., P.S., I.I.O.,\" was deposited for him by an official messenger in the hall of the Alfred Club, might have thought otherwise. The inferior portion of the duty was performed by a clerk, and Mr. Aldermaston contented himself with taking Lord Waterhouse\u0027s signature to a few papers occasionally, and receiving a select few of the most distinguished persons who wished for personal interviews. This left him plenty of leisure to pursue his more amusing occupation of purveyor of gossip and inventor and retailer of scandal. In these capacities he was without a rival. He always knew everything; and if he did not know it, he invented it, which in some respects was better, as it enabled him to flavour his anecdotes with a piquancy which was perhaps wanting in the original. He found occupation for his ears and tongue in a variety of topics; the heaviest subjects were not excluded, the lightest obtained a place in his répertoire. The rumour of the approaching change in the premiership, while passing through the Aldermaston crucible, encountered the report of Mademoiselle de la Normandie\u0027s refusal to dance her pas seul before Madame Rivière; the report of Lady Propagand\u0027s conversion to Romanism did not prevent Mr. Aldermaston\u0027s giving proper additional publicity to the whisper of Miss de Toddler\u0027s flight with the milkman. There were not many people who liked Mr. Aldermaston, though there were a great many who feared him; but Lord Dollamore was among the former class. \"He is a blagueur,\" Dollamore used to say; \"and a blagueur is a detestable beast; but necessary to society; and Aldermaston is certainly clean. He knows how to behave himself, and is in fact an Ananias of polite society. Besides, he amuses me, and there are very few people in the world who amuse me.\" So Lord Dollamore always spoke to Mr. Aldermaston at the club, and encouraged him to tell his anecdotes; and when he found him at Baden, he looked upon him as one of the resources of the place,-a purveyor of news infinitely fresher, more piquant, and more amusing than was to be found in the week-old Times or three-days-old Galignani, which he found at Misses Marx\u0027s library. So he again repeated, \"And what\u0027s the latest news in this Inferno, Mr. Aldermaston?\" \"Well, there\u0027s very little news here, my lord, very little indeed; except that young Lord Plaidington is gone--sent away this morning.\" \"Sent away?\" \"Yes; his mother, Lady Macabaw, wouldn\u0027t stand it any longer. Last night Lord Plaidington took too much again, and began throwing the empty champagne-bottles out of the window of the Angleterre; so Lady Macabaw sent him off this morning with his tutor, the Rev. Sandford Merton, and they\u0027ve gone to Strasburg, on the way to Italy.\" \"Serve him right, the young cub. I went away early last night--any heavy play late?\" \"Yes; a Frenchman whom no one had ever seen before won a hatful at roulette, and some Englishman whom no one seemed to know backed him and stood in. They looked like breaking the bank at one time, but they didn\u0027t.\" \"Was Tchernigow at the tables?\" \"No; the Prince did not show up at all,--has not been there for the last three nights.\" \"So much the worse for Benazet; but what does it mean?\" \"Well, I\u0027ve a notion about that that I won\u0027t broach to any one but your Lordship. I think I\u0027ve found the clue to that story.\" \"What story? what clue?\" \"Prince Tchernigow\u0027s sudden cessation from play. You know what a mania it was with him. It must have been something special to make him give it up.\" \"And what is the something special?\" \"A woman.\" \"Ah!\" said Lord Dollamore, warming a once into interest; \"malheureux en jeu, heureux en amour,--the converse of the ordinarily-received motto. Has Mademoiselle Féodor arrived from the Gaieté? or who is the siren that charms our Prince from the tables?\" \"Mademoiselle Féodor has not arrived, but some one else has. A much more dangerous person than Mademoiselle Féodor, and with much more lasting hopes in view.\" Lord Dollamore looked keenly at his companion, and said, \"I begin to find the scent warming; but I make it a rule never to guess. Tell your story, Mr. Aldermaston, please.\" \"Well, you know, Lord Dollamore, I\u0027m staying at the Russie, and I\u0027ve made myself so agreeable to Malmedie, the landlord there, by little bits of civility, that he generally comes up to my room in the morning and lets me know all that is going on. He showed me a letter that he had about a week ago, written in French, saying that a lady wanted rooms reserved for herself and maid; that she would not dine at the table-d\u0027h?te, being an invalid, and coming only for the benefit of the air and springs, but should require dinner and all her meals served in her own rooms. The French of the letter was excellent, but the idea of retirement looked essentially English. I never knew a Frenchwoman, in however bad a state of health, who could resist the attractions of society; so, though I said nothing to Malmedie, I guessed at once the lady was English; and as there seemed a mystery, I determined to penetrate it.\" Lord Dollamore smiled, and whispered something to his stick; something of which the French word \"chiffonnier\" and the English word \"garbage\" were component parts; but Mr. Aldermaston did not hear the sentence, and only marking the smile, proceeded: \"They were expected on Wednesday afternoon, and I took care to be about. They came in the eilwagen from Carlsruhe,--a deuced fine-looking woman, with her face hidden in a thick black veil, and a very neat trim little French waiting-maid. The servant was French, but the boxes were English,--I\u0027d take my oath of that. There was a substantial solidity about their make, a certainty about their locks and hinges, such as never yet was seen on a French box, I\u0027ll stake my existence.\" \"You have wonderful powers of observation, Mr. Aldermaston,\" said Dollamore, still grinning. \"Your lordship flatters me. I have a pair of eyes, and I think I can use them. I kept them pretty tightly fixed on the movements of the new-comers. Dinner was sent up to their rooms, but before it went up the lady\u0027s-maid went out. I was strolling about myself, with nothing to do just at that time, so I strolled after her. She went into the Angleterre, and in a few minutes came tripping out again. She went back to the Russie, and so did I. I had nothing to do, and sat down in the porch, behind one of those tubs with the orange-trees, to smoke a cigar. While I was smoking it, who should come up but Prince Tchernigow?\" \"Prince Tchernigow!\" cried Lord Dollamore. \"Connu! I\u0027m in full cry now, Mr. Aldermaston. But continue your story.\" \"Prince Tchernigow,\" continued Mr. Aldermaston, \"and no one else. He asked for Madame Poitevin, in which name the rooms had been taken, and he was shown upstairs. He came the next day twice, twice yesterday; he was there this morning; and just now, as I came away from the table-d\u0027h?te, I met him on the steps going in.\" \"Mr. Aldermaston, you are impayable!\" said Dollamore. \"I must pay a compliment to your perspicacity, even at the risk of forestalling the conclusion of your narrative. But you have told it so admirably, that no man with a grain of sense in his head could avoid seeing that Madame Poitevin is Mrs. Hammond.\" \"Exactly,--I have not a doubt of it,\" said the little man; \"and if so, I think you and I, my lord, know some one whose state of mind must be awful.\" \"Yes,\" said Lord Dollamore, rising from his chair; \"I see what you mean, and you are doubtless right. Poor Percy Hammond\u0027s relatives must feel it acutely. Goodnight, Mr. Aldermaston;\" and he bowed and moved off. \"I\u0027m not going to let that little cad indulge in any speculations about the Mitfords,\" said he to his stick. \"That woman\u0027s far too good to be discussed by such vermin as that;\" by which we may judge that Lord Dollamore\u0027s opinion of Lady Mitford had altered as his acquaintance with her had progressed. The deductions which Mr. Aldermaston had made from this last experiment in espionage were tolerably correct. Laura Hammond was in Baden under the name of Madame Poitevin, and accompanied by the never-failing Marcelline. She had hurried away from London for two reasons. The first, and by far the most important, was to perfect the conquest of Tchernigow; to clinch home that iron band which for the last two months she had been fitting round the Russian\u0027s neck; to bring him to make the offer of his hand at once. The short time passed in London since her husband\u0027s death had been spent in looking her future boldly in the face, and calculating within herself how she should mould it for the best. Lord Dollamore was right in one of his conjectures about her: she had made up her mind that the course of her life must henceforth be entirely altered. She knew well enough that even the short time she had been away from London and its world was sufficient to render her name almost forgotten; and she determined that when it was next mentioned it should be in a very different tone from that formerly adopted towards it. Respectability--that state so often sneered at and ridiculed by her--she now held in the highest veneration, and determined to attain to. She had her work to do; to restore herself in the world\u0027s good opinion, and to make, as soon as decency would permit, a good marriage. The last position gained, the first would necessarily follow. All she had to do, she thought, was to keep herself in seclusion and choose her intended victim. She thought of Sir Laurence Alsager at once. She had yet for him a remnant of what she imagined was love, but what was really thwarted passion. Her feelings were stronger for him than for any other man; and he had large wealth, and a good old family title, and the good opinion of the world. When, after his interview with her, she saw the utter futility of her plans so far as he was concerned, she was enraged, but by no means defeated. The cast must be made in another direction, and at once. Prince Tchernigow was in town; she knew it, for she had had more than one note from him during her seclusion in the country, and she knew that Tchernigow was hanging on in town on the chance of seeing her. This flashed across her the moment Laurence had quitted her, and her heart gave a great leap. That was the man! He was a prince; he was three times as rich as Alsager, and was known in the best society of every capital in Europe. Life with him as his wife would not be spent buried two-thirds of the year in a great gaunt country-place, where interest in the Sunday-schools and the old women and the clergyman\u0027s charities were the excitements; life with him would be one round of gaiety, in which she would not be a follower, but a leader. He had been madly in love with her two years before; and from what she knew of his nature, she believed the passion still remained there. That could be easily ascertained. She would write him a note, bidding him to come and see her. Tchernigow came at once. He had not been with Laura ten minutes before her sharp eyes had looked into his heart and read its secrets so far as she was concerned. He was chafing under a latent passion, a thwarted wish. When, just at the close of their companionship at Baden two years ago, he had ventured to make open protestation of his devotion to her, and she had turned on him with great dignity and snubbed him mercilessly, he had bowed and left her, cool and collected indeed in his manner, but inwardly raging like a volcano. He had never met with similar treatment. With him it was a question of throwing the handkerchief, to the delight of Nourmahal or whoever might be the lucky one towards whom his highness tossed it. The ladies of the corps dramatique of the different Parisian theatres were wild with delight when they heard that Tchernigow had arrived in Paris, and the will of mon Cosaque, as he was called by more than one, was supreme and indisputable among them. This was quite a new thing. Not merely to have his proffered love rejected, but to be soundly rated for having dared to proffer it, was to him almost inexplicable. It lashed him to fury. For the next season he kept away from London, determined to avoid the siren who held him in her toils, yet despised his suit. Then, hearing of her widowhood and her absence from London, he came to England with a half-formed determination in regard to her. He saw her, and almost instantaneously the smouldering fires of his passion were revivified, and blazed up more fiercely than ever. He had more encouragement now, but even now not very much. He was permitted to declare his devotion to her, to rave in his odd wild way about her beauty, to kiss her hand on his arrival and departure--nothing more. Trust Laura Hammond for knowing exactly how to treat a man of Tchernigow\u0027s temperament. He came daily; he sat feasting his eyes on her beauty, and listening--sometimes in wonder, but always in admiration--to her conversation, which was now sparkling with wit and fun, now brimming over with sentiment and pathos. Day by day he became more and more hopelessly entangled by her fascinations, but as yet he had breathed no word about marriage; and to that end, and that alone, was Laura Hammond leading him on. But when Parliament was dissolved, and town rapidly thinning; when Laura\u0027s solicitor had written urgently to her, stating that \"the other side\" was pressing for a final settlement of affairs--which meant her abdicating her state and taking up her lowered position on her lessened income--Tchernigow called upon her, and while telling her that he was going to Baden, seemed to do more than hint that her hopes would be fulfilled, if she would consent to meet him there so soon as her business was accomplished. This was the principal motive which had induced her to start for the pretty little Inferno on the border of the Black Forest. But the other was scarcely less cogent. The fact was, that Laura was wearying rapidly of the attentions of Sir Charles Mitford. Her caprice for him was over. He had never had the power of amusing her; and since she knew that Laurence Alsager had left England, she saw that she could no longer wreak her vengeance on him by punishing Lady Mitford through the faithlessness of Sir Charles. Mitford saw that she was growing weary of him--marked it in a thousand different ways, and raged against it. Occasionally his manner to her would change from what she now called maudlin tenderness to savage ferocity; he would threaten her vaguely, he would watch her narrowly. It required all Laura\u0027s natural genius for intrigue, supplemented by Madlle. Marcelline\u0027s adroitness, to prevent his knowing of Tchernigow\u0027s visits. In his blind infatuation he was rapidly forgetting the decencies of life, the convenances of society; he was getting himself more and more talked about; what was worse, he was getting her talked about again, just at the time when she wanted to be forgotten by all men--save one. Mitford had followed her into the country, and only quitted her on her expressed determination never to speak to him again unless he returned to London at once, and saved her from the gossip of the neighbourhood. She knew he would insist on seeing her constantly when she returned to town. Hence her flight with only one hour\u0027s stoppage in London--and under a feigned name--to Baden. \"\u0027I pray you come at once,\u0027\" said Dollamore, three days after his conversation with Mr. Aldermaston, reading to his stick the contents of a dainty little note which he had just received;--\"\u0027I pray you come at once.--Yours sincerely, Laura Hammond.\u0027 Very much yours sincerely, Laura Hammond, I should think. What the deuce does she want with me? Is she going to drive us three abreast, like the horses in the diligence? and does she think I should like to trot along between Mitford and Tchernigow? Not she! She knows me too well to think anything of that sort. But then what on earth does she want with me? \u0027I pray you come at once.\u0027 Egad, I must go, I suppose, and ask for Madame Poitevin, as she tells me.\" He lounged up to the H?tel de Russie, asked for Madame Poitevin, and was shown into a room where Laura was seated with Marcelline reading to her. Dollamore recollected Marcelline at once; he had an eye for beauty in every class, and had taken not an unfavourable notice of the trim little soubrette during his stay at Redmoor. He wondered now what had caused this sudden elevation of her social status, and did not ascribe it to any good source. But he had little time to wonder about Marcelline, for she rose at once, and passing him with a slight bow, left the room as Mrs. Hammond advanced with outstretched hand. She looked splendidly handsome; her eyes were bright, her cheeks flushed, her step elastic. Dollamore thought he had scarcely ever seen her to such advantage. \"You are surprised at my having sent to you, Lord Dollamore?\" said she as soon as they were seated. \"No, indeed, Mrs. Hammond; I\u0027m never surprised at anything. A man who has turned forty and suffers himself to be surprised is an idiot.\" \"Turned forty! Well, when you reach that age you shall tell me whether there is truth in that axiom.\" (\"Flattering me!\" said Dollamore to his stick; \"wants to borrow money.\") \"But at all events you don\u0027t know why I asked you to come.\" \"I have not the remotest idea.\" \"How should you have? Three hours ago I myself had no anticipation of the occurrence of circumstances which have induced me to ask you to share a confidence.\" \"Hallo!\" said Dollamore to his stick; \"I share a confidence! She ought to have sent for Aldermaston.\" But he said aloud, \"If I can be of any help to you--\" \"You can be of the very greatest assistance. You may have heard how I have been left by my husband; how Mr. Hammond\u0027s relatives, by their cruel and secret machinations, so worked upon him in his enfeebled state as to induce him to make a most shameful will, by which I was robbed of all that ought to have been mine, and left with a beggarly income!\" She had not forgotten that will, and any recurrence to it made her cheek flame in earnest. Dollamore bowed. He ought to have expressed some pity or some astonishment; but he had never during his life been guilty of any conventionality. \"In this strait,\" she continued, \"I have received succour from a totally unexpected quarter. In the most generous and delicate manner Prince Tchernigow has this day made me an offer of his hand.\" (Dollamore said he was never surprised, but if the stick was on the alert it must have heard him whistle.) \"We are to be married at once!\" \"Very satisfactory indeed,\" said Dollamore. \"Fancy being a princess, with \u0027vassals and serfs by your side\u0027!--Very delicious indeed.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m so happy!\" cried Laura, with that feigned ecstasy of joy which she had so often indulged in; \"the Prince is so charming!\" \"Is he indeed?\" said Dollamore. \"Yes; some people require to be known thoroughly before they\u0027re appreciated. But what will a friend of ours say to this? I mean Sir Charles Mitford.\" \"Ah!\" said Laura, who turned pale at the name; \"that is exactly the subject in which I require your assistance.\" \"Mine! How can I help you? Suppose he were to come here--\" \"It is that I am dreading. I took every precaution to hide my destination. I came here under a feigned name; I have lived in the strictest retirement, having seen no one but the Prince since I have been here; and yet I never hear a carriage dash up to the door of the hotel but I rush to the window, and concealing myself behind the curtains, look out in the full expectation of seeing him leap into the portico. If he were to come now, under present circumstances, what should I do?--good God, what should I do?\" \"What should you do? Tell him to go back again. You are not his wife, for him to bully and curse and order about. You are not bound to give in to his cowardly whims, and need not endure his ruffianly insults.\" \"You don\u0027t know him now; you don\u0027t know how frightful his temper has become to any one who crosses him. No, no, no, we shall be married at once, and leave this place; and should he come here afterwards, I trust you to tell him nothing more than you can possibly help; above all, to keep silence as to our intended route.\" \"That will be easily managed, by your not telling me which way you intend going. I\u0027ll do what I can to help you, Mrs. Hammond; but I may as well say, that the less I am brought into contact with Sir Charles Mitford, the better I shall be pleased.\" \"At all events you will do as much as I have asked you?\" she said. \"I will; and as that principally consists in holding my tongue, I shall have no difficulty in doing it. When are you to be married?\" \"To-morrow morning, at Frankfort, where there are both Russian and English embassies; and whence we start to--\" \"You forget; I was not to know your route.\" \"I had forgotten,\" she said with a smile. She seemed reassured; her colour came again, and as she held out her hand, she said, \"I may rely on you?\" \"Rigidly to do nothing,\" he said; and took her hand, and left her. \"She\u0027s a very wonderful woman, and she certainly has had a great run of luck,\" said Dollamore, as he walked back to his hotel. \"To think of her getting hold of this Calmuck savage! By Jove! rich as he is, she\u0027ll try and find her way to the bottom of his sack of roubles. Tchernigow is wealthy, but his intendant will have to screw up the moujiks to the last copeck to provide for madame\u0027s splendid power of spending. She\u0027s evidently completely frightened of Mitford now. It must be sheer brutality that has done that, for he was no match for her in spirit, or anything else.\" As he said this, he arrived at the Badischer Hof, before the door of which was standing a dust-covered carriage with two steaming horses; and in the hall Lord Dollamore saw a man, whose back was towards him, talking earnestly to Mr. Aldermaston. The man turned round at the sound of footsteps, and then Dollamore saw that it was Sir Charles Mitford.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3078/85039.html","bookId":966,"book":{"id":966,"title":"Running the Gauntlet","description":"简介： Throughout the length and breadth of this London of ours there were few legal firms, no matter of how old standing, doing a better, larger ready-money business than that of Moss and Moss of Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane.
