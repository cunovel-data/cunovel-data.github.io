{"id":38727,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. DRAWING COVER.","content":"It was part of the crafty policy of the tall-hatted Mr. Griffiths to keep his employer Mr. Effingham in good humour, and to show that he was worth seeing occasionally; and it was with this end in view that Mr. Griffiths had spoken so confidently of Mr. Lyons\u0027s undoubted knowledge of the whereabouts of the forged bill and of his (Griffiths\u0027s) intention of seeking an immediate interview with Lyons. But, in sober truth, Mr. Griffiths merely had a faint notion that Lyons, from his previous connection with Tony Butler and his general acquaintance with the shady transactions of the deceased, might possibly give a guess as to the hands in which the bill then was, while he had not the remotest idea where to find the redoubtable Mr. Lyons himself, with a view to obtain from him the necessary information. For Mr. Lyons, as is the case with many gentlemen of his persuasion, did not confine his energies to the exercise of one calling, but dabbled in a great many. To some men he was known as a jeweller and diamond-merchant; to others as an importer of French clocks, whistling bullfinches, and German mustard; to some he was known in connection with the discounting of stamped paper; to others as a picture-dealer, a cigar-merchant, a vendor of objets d\u0027art of a very peculiar kind. He had no residence--that is to say, he had a great many, but none particularly tangible or satisfactory. He would write to you dating from a number in Clement\u0027s Inn; and when you called there, you would find the name of Mr. Glubb over the door, with a painted square of tin by the letter-slit announcing that Mr. Glubb had removed to Great Decorum Street, and that letters for him were to be left with the porter; and lower still you would find a dirty scrap of paper, with \"M. Lyons\" faintly traced upon it; and on the door being opened, you would find M. Lyons in a room with one chair, one table, a blotting-pad, pen and ink, and a cheque-book. He was in the habit of making appointments at coffee-houses and taverns; and when he sent the clocks or the bullfinches, the cigars or the objets d\u0027art, to their purchasers, they arrived at night, being left at the door by mysterious boys, to whom they had been given, with the address and twopence, by a man whom they had never seen before, but who was just round the corner. There was, it was said, one permanent address which Mr. Lyons had kept up for a great number of years; but this was known only to those with whom in their relation with Mr. Lyons a melting-pot was associated, and these were very few in number. Mr. Griffiths was getting desperate, for the last half-crown out of the ten pounds lay in his pocket, and his principal Mr. Effingham had already spoken to him rather sharply on the matter. He had been to all Mr. Lyons\u0027s known haunts; he had spoken to a dozen people who were known to be of his intimates; but he could obtain no tidings of him. Some thought he might be at Amsterdam, where the diamond-sale was going on; others had heard him mention his intention of visiting Frankfort about that period; some laughed, and wondered whether old Malachi had heard of the plate-robbery, \"thalvers ath big round ath a cart-veel, and thpoonth, all new, not a bit rubbed!\" which had lately taken place. But no one could give any precise information. And time was going on, and Mr. Effingham\u0027s patience and Mr. Griffiths\u0027s stock of ready-money were rapidly becoming exhausted. One night, going into \"Johnson\u0027s\" as usual, Mr. Griffiths saw his principal seated at one of the tables, and not caring to confront him just then, was about quietly withdrawing as much of his tall hat as he had already protruded through the swing-door, when he was espied and called to by Mr. Effingham. \"Come in, there; don\u0027t think I didn\u0027t see you, because I did. What a slimy cove you are, Griffiths!--that\u0027s what I complain of; nothing fair and above-board in you.\" \"Who\u0027s to be fair and above-board,\" growled Mr. Griffiths, \"if they\u0027re to be everlastingly growled at and badgered? What I come here for is to be quiet and \u0027ave a little peace, not to be worritted and downed upon. D\u0027rectly I see you sittin\u0027 here, I knowed it\u0027d be, \u0027Well, and wot\u0027s up?\u0027 and \u0027Ain\u0027t you got no news?\u0027 and \u0027Wot a feller you are, not to \u0027ave learned somethink!\u0027 so, as I didn\u0027t seem to care about that, I was goin\u0027 away agen.\" \"Poor feller,\" said Mr. Effingham with great contempt, \"don\u0027t like being worried or having to work for your livin\u0027, don\u0027t you? I wonder you didn\u0027t get yourself a government berth, where pokin\u0027 the fire and whistlin\u0027 tunes is what they do when they\u0027re there, which is only the three winter months of the year. So you\u0027ve brought no news?\" \"Not a stiver, not a ha\u0027porth, not a blessed word. There, you may as well take it all at once!\" said Griffiths in desperation. \"And you\u0027ve been everywhere likely?\" \"Everywhere,--in every gaff and crib where there was the least chance of hearin\u0027 of the old boy; but not a word.\" \"Now you see what a thing luck is,\" said Mr. Effingham sententiously; \"I believe that old City cove who said he couldn\u0027t afford to know an unlucky man was right after all; and I\u0027m not at all sure I\u0027m right, Master Griffiths, in not dropping your acquaintance, for certingly you\u0027re an unlucky buffer, if ever there was one.\" \"Well, p\u0027raps I am, D\u0027Ossay,\" said Griffiths, who began to see how the land lay; \"perhaps I am in some things; but it ain\u0027t only luck,--I\u0027m as lucky as most of \u0027em; but it\u0027s the talent as does it--the talent; and there\u0027s none of us has got that like you, D\u0027Ossay, my boy.\" \"Well, luck or talent, or whatever it is,\" said Effingham, pulling the bell, \"it helps me on.--Bring some brandy and hot water here.--I come in here to have a mouthful o\u0027 bread and cheese and a glass o\u0027 ale about two this afternoon, and Pollock was in here; Jack Pollock they call him,--the fellow that writes the plays, you know.\" Mr. Griffiths, over his first gulp of brandy-and-water, nodded his head in acquiescence. \"Things is going on rather bad at the Garden,\" continued Mr. Effingham; \"I don\u0027t know whether you\u0027ve heard. Their pantomime\u0027s been a reg\u0027lar failure this year, and Wuff\u0027s paper\u0027s beginning to fly again. I suppose old Lyons is in that swim, for Pollock says to me, \u0027Didn\u0027t I hear you askin\u0027 after Mr. Lyons?\u0027 he says. \u0027I did,\u0027 I says. \u0027I thought so,\u0027 he says; \u0027and I told him so when I saw him just now in Wuff\u0027s room at the Garden. And he says, \"I\u0027ve just come back from abroad, and I don\u0027t reckleckt Mr. Effingham\u0027s name,\" he says; \"but if he\u0027s one of the right sort, he\u0027ll find me among the lemons on Sunday morning.\"\u0027 So I thanked Pollock, and winked my eye, and nodded my head, and made believe as though I knew all about it; but I don\u0027t.\" \"You don\u0027t?\" \"Not a bit of it; I\u0027m as far off as ever, save for knowing that the old man\u0027s in England.\" \"You ain\u0027t fly to what\u0027s meant by \u0027among the lemons,\u0027 eh?\" \"Not a bit of it, I tell you. What are you grinning and chuckling away at there, Griffiths? That\u0027s one of your disgustin\u0027 ways,--crowin\u0027 over me because you know something which I don\u0027t.\" \"Don\u0027t be riled, D\u0027Ossay; don\u0027t be riled, old feller. It\u0027s so seldom that I get a chance of findin\u0027 anything that you don\u0027t know, young though you are, that I make the most of it, I confess.\" \"Well, there, all right. Now do you know what he meant by \u0027among the lemons\u0027?\" \"Of course I do.\" \"And what does it mean?\" \"\u0027Among the lemons\u0027 is magsman\u0027s patter for \u0027Houndsditch.\u0027 There\u0027s a reg\u0027lar gatherin\u0027 of sheenies there every Sunday mornin\u0027, where they have a kind of fair, and sellin\u0027 all sorts of things,--clothes, and books, and pictures, and so on.\" \"Well, but old Lyons is a cut above all that sort of thing.\" \"I should think he was.\" \"He wouldn\u0027t be found there.\" \"Well, not sellin\u0027 anything; but he might be on the lookout for some magsmen as work for him, and who may have had the office to be about there. But if he\u0027s not there, I\u0027d know where to lay hands on him, I\u0027d take my oath.\" \"Where\u0027s that?\" \"At the Net of Lemons, a public where sheenies of all kinds--diamond-merchants, fences, all sorts--meet on the Sunday.\" \"Do you know the place?\" \"Know it! I should think so, and Mr. Eliason as keeps it; as respectable an old gent as walks.\" \"They\u0027d let you in?\" \"Ah, and you too, if I squared it for you.\" \"Very well, then; we\u0027ll hunt up old Lyons on Sunday morning.\" Mr. Effingham was so pleased with his chance of success, that Mr. Griffiths thought he might borrow half-a-sovereign; and what is more, he got it. On the following Sunday morning Mr. Effingham found himself by appointment opposite Bishopgate Church as the clock struck ten, and Mr. Griffiths there waiting for him. As he approached, Mr. Effingham took stock of his friend\u0027s personal appearance, and mentally congratulated himself that it was at the East and not at the West end of London that they were to be seen in company together; for those mysterious means by which Mr. Griffiths went through \"the fever called living\" had not been very productive of late, and his wardrobe was decidedly seedy. The tall hat shone so as to give one the idea that its owner had forgotten to remove it when he applied the morning macassar to his hair, and the suit of once-black clothes looked as if they had been bees-waxed. Mr. Effingham must have allowed his thoughts to be mirrored in his expressive countenance, for Mr. Griffiths said as he joined him: \"Looking at my togs, D\u0027Ossay? Well, they ain\u0027t as nobby as yours; but you see, I don\u0027t go in to be a \u0027eavy swell. They\u0027ll do well enough for the caper we\u0027re on to-day, though; better perhaps than your gridironed kickseys.\" At another time Mr. Effingham might have shown annoyance at thus having his check trousers sneeringly spoken of; but something which Griffiths had said had rather dashed him, and it was with a little hesitation that he asked: \"They--they ain\u0027t a very rough lot that we\u0027re going amongst, are they?\" \"Well, there\u0027s more rough nor smooth hair among \u0027em; but they won\u0027t do you no harm; I\u0027ll look after you, D\u0027Ossay. Shovin you won\u0027t mind, nor elbers in every part of your body at once. Oh, and I say, don\u0027t leave any-think in your \u0027ind-pockets, and put your fogle in your \u0027at. Like this, look. I carry most things in my \u0027at.\" And Mr. Griffiths whipped off the tall hat, and showed in it a handkerchief, a greasy parcel suspiciously like a ham sandwich, a pocket comb, and a paper book with the title \"The Olio of Oddities, or the Warbling Wagoner\u0027s Wallet of Wit and Wisdom.\" Mr. Effingham took his friend\u0027s advice, and transferred all his portable property from the tail-pockets of his coat to other less patent recesses, and the pair started on their excursion. Crossing Bishopgate, and turning short round to the right up a street called Sandy\u0027s Row, past a huge black block of buildings belonging to the East India Company, and used as a store-house for costly silks, round which seethed and bubbled a dirty, pushing, striving, fighting, higgling, chaffering, vociferating, laughing mob, filling up the narrow street, the small strips of pavement on either side, and what ought to have been the carriage-way between them. It was Sunday, and may have been observed \"as such\" elsewhere, but certainly not in Sandy\u0027s Row or Cutler\u0027s Row. There were shops of all kinds, and all at work: tool-shops,--files, saws, adzes, knives, chisels, hammers, and tool-baskets displayed in the open windows, whence the sashes had been removed for the better furtherance of trade; hatters\u0027, hosiers\u0027, tailors\u0027, bootmakers\u0027 shops, the proprietors of which had left the calm asylum of their counters and stood at the doors, importuning the passers-by with familiar blandishments; for in the carriage-way through which Effingham and Griffiths slowly forced a passage, were peripatetic vendors of hats, hosiery, clothes, and boots,--hook-nosed oleaginous gentry with ten pairs of trousers over one arm, and five coats over the other, with enormous boots, a few hats, and a number of cloth caps. Mr. Effingham soon learned the value of his friend\u0027s advice, for there were thieves of all kinds in the motley crowd; big burly roughs, with sunken eyes and massive jaws, sulkily elbowing their way through the mass, and \"gonophs\" or pickpockets of fourteen or fifteen, with their collarless tightly-tied neckerchief, their greasy caps, and \"aggerawater\" curls. Delicate attention was paid to Mr. Effingham before he had been five minutes amongst them. The hind-pockets of his coat were turned inside out, and he was \"sounded\" all over by a pair of lightly-touching hands. Whether Mr. Griffiths was known, or whether his personal appearance was unattractive and promised no hope of adequate reward, is uncertain; but no attempt was made on him. While Mr. Effingham was vaguely gaping about him, staring at everything and thoroughly impressed with the novelty of his situation, Griffiths had been taking stock of the crowd, and keeping a strict lookout for Mr. Lyons. Jews were there in shoals, and of all kinds: the grand old Jewish type, dignified and bearded, than which, when good, there is nothing better; handsome sensual-looking men, with bright eyes, and hook-noses, and scarlet lips; red frizzy-headed Jews, with red eyelids, and shambling gait, and nasal intonation; big flat-headed, stupid-looking men, with thick lips, and tongues too large for their mouths, and visibly protruding therefrom;--all kinds of Jews, but Mr. Lyons not among them. So they pushed on, uncaring for the chaff of the mob, which was very facetious on the subject of Mr. Effingham\u0027s attire, saluting him as a \"collared bloke,\" in delicate compliment to his wearing a clean shirt; asking whether he was a \"Rooshan;\" whether he were not \"Prince Halbut\u0027s brother,\" and other delicate compliments,--pushed on until they arrived at the Clothes-Exchange, a roofed building filled round every side and in the centre with old-clothes stalls. Here, piled up in wondrous confusion, lay hats, coats, boots, hob-nailed shoes, satin ball-shoes, driving-coats, satin dresses, hoops, brocaded gowns, flannel jackets, fans, shirts, stockings with clocks, stockings with torn and darned feet, feathers, parasols, black-silk mantles, blue-kid boots, belcher neckerchiefs, and lace ruffles. More Jews here; salesmen shrieking out laudations of their wares, and frantically imploring passers-by to come in and be fitted: \"Here\u0027th a coat! plue Vitney; trai this plue Vitney, ma tear.\" \"Here\u0027th a vethkit for you, thir!\" shouted one man to Effingham; \"thuch a vethkit! a thplendid vethkit, covered all over with blue-and-thilver thpright.\" Mr. Effingham cast a longing eye at this gorgeous garment, but passed on. No Lyons here, either among sharp-eyed vendors or leering buyers. Mr. Griffiths was getting nonplussed, and Mr. Effingham growing anxious. \"We must find him, Griffiths,\" he said; \"we must not throw away this chance that he\u0027s given us; he may be off to the Continent, Lord knows where, to-morrow. Why the devil don\u0027t you find him?\" Mr. Griffiths intimated that so far as eye-straining could be gone through, he had done his best; and suggested that if the man they sought were not there, all the energy in the world would not discover him. \"But there\u0027s the Net of Lemons yet,\" he said; \"that\u0027s, after all, the safest draw, and we\u0027re more likely to hit upon him there than anywhere else.\" So they pushed their way through the steaming, seething, struggling crowd, and found themselves in a quiet dull little square. Across this, and merely glancing at several groups of men dotted here and there in its midst, loudly talking and gesticulating with energy which smacked more of the Hamburg B?rsenhalle or the Frankfort Zeil than the stolid reticence of England, Mr. Griffiths led his companion until they stopped before the closed door of a public house, aloft from which swung the sign of \"The Net of Lemons.\" At the door Mr. Griffiths gave three mystic raps, at the third of which the door opened for about a couple of inches, and a thick voice said, \"Who is it?\" \"All right, Mr. Eliason. Griffiths, whom you know. Take a squint, and judge for yourself.\" Mr. Eliason probably followed this advice, and finding the inspection satisfactory, opened the door to its extent, and admitted the pair; but raising his bushy brows in doubt as to Mr. Effingham, Griffiths said, \"A friend of mine--come on partickler business, and by appointment with Mr. Lyons. Is he here?\" The reference was apparently satisfactory, for Mr. Eliason, a fat good-looking big man in a soft wideawake hat, said, \"You\u0027ll find him inside;\" and shut the door behind them. Mr. Effingham walking through, and following his conductor, found himself in a low-roofed, square-built, comfortable room, round three sides of which were ranged tables, and on these tables were placed large open trays of jewelry. There they lay in clusters, thick gold chains curled round and round like snares; long limp silver chains such as are worn by respectable mechanics over black-satin waistcoats on Sundays; great carbuncle pins glowing out of green-velvet cases; diamond rings and pins and brooches and necklaces. The best emeralds in quaint old-fashioned gold settings nestled by the side of lovely pale opals; big finger-rings made up after the antique with cut cornelian centrepieces; long old-fashioned earrings; little heaps of rubies, emeralds, and turquoises set aside in the corners of the trays; big gold and silver cups and goblets and trays and tazzas; here and there a clumsy old epergne; finger-rings by the bushel, pins by the gross; watches of all kinds, from delicate gold Genevas to the thick turnipy silver \"ticker\" of the schoolboy; and shoals of watchworks without cases. On this Tom Tidler\u0027s ground were crowds of customers, smoking strong cigars, walking about without let or hindrance, and examining--ay, and handling--the jewels without creating the least consternation in the breasts of their vendors. There was a slight movement among the company at the entrance of the new-comers; but Griffiths seemed to be known to a few, with whom he exchanged salutations, and the appearance of Mr. Eliason with them settled any wandering doubts which might have arisen in the minds of the others. As for Mr. Effingham, he began to think he was in the cave into which Aladdin descended to get the lamp at the bidding of the magician; and he went moving round, gazing first on one side, then on the other, lost in wonder. But Mr. Griffiths, to whom the scene was tolerably familiar, went at once to business, scrutinizing with keen glance the buyers and sellers, poking his nose into the groups of domino-players in the corners, hunting about with admirable patience and forbearance, but for a long time with no result. At last he stopped before a group of three. One of these was an old Jewish gentleman, with strongly-marked features, overhanging bushy eyebrows, hooked nose, and long white beard. He held in his hand a blue paper, such as generally contains seidlitz-powders, but its contents were diamonds. These were being carefully inspected by the other two men, each of whom had a bright steel pair of pincers, with which he selected a specimen from the glittering heap, breathed upon it, watched it carefully, and in most instances finally laid it on one side for purchase. When this transaction had been gone through and was at an end, the old gentleman folded up his paper with such diamonds as remained in it, placed it in his waistcoat-pocket, and was calmly walking away, when Griffiths touched him on the arm, saying interrogatively, \"Mr. Lyons?\" The old man turned in an instant, and threw a sharp look of inquiry over his interlocutor, as he said: \"Yes, ma tear sir, that\u0027s mai name; not ashamed to own it any veres. Vot might you vant with me?\" As he spoke he had covered his waistcoat-pocket with his hand, and stood prim and spry. \"This gentleman--Mr. Effingham--has been looking for you some little time. You told a friend of his--Mr. Pollock--that you would be here to-day, and we\u0027ve come on purpose to meet you.\" \"Effingham! Pollock!\" said the old man, musing. \"O yes, Pollock, who writes those funny burlesques for my friend Wuff; O yes--Effingham,\" he said. \"How do you do, ma tear? Now vot is it? A leetle advance, or something you\u0027ve got that you don\u0027t know how to get rid of, and think I might fancy it, eh?\" \"Well, it ain\u0027t either, Mr. Lyons,\" said Effingham. \"Its a little information you\u0027re in possession of that you might be inclined to give us, and--\" \"You\u0027re not traps?\" asked Mr. Lyons, turning pale. \"Not a bit of it, Mr. Lyons,\" said Griffiths, striking into the conversation. \"Quite different from that. You and I have done business before. I was with--\" and here he whispered into Lyons\u0027s ear. \"Ah, I reckleckt,\" said the old gentleman. \"That vos a very good plant, and bothers them all in Scotland Yard to this day. Ha, ha! I reckleckt. Now vot did your friend say? Information? Veil, you know, I never give information.\" \"No, no, of course not,\" said Griffiths, winking at Effingham. \"O no, sir,\" said that worthy. \"I\u0027m prepared to pay, of course, anything reasonable for what I require.\" \"Vell, vell, ma tear, let\u0027s know vot it is.\" \"You were great pals with my brother, I believe?\" \"No. Effingham? No;--never heard the name.\" \"No, no; not Effingham. That\u0027s merely--you understand?\" \"O ah! O yes! I qvite understand; but vot is the name?\" \"Butler! You knew Tony Butler well?\" \"Knew him vell; I should rather think I did. A good fellow; a clever fellow; oh, a very clever fellow, ma tear.\" \"Yes; well, I\u0027m his brother.\" \"Not like him,\" said Mr. Lyons. \"More dressy, and not so business-like. A rare fellow for business, Tony.\" \"That may or may not be,\" said Effingham, slightly offended. \"Now, when he died, you cleared off his traps.\" \"Only a few sticks; very poor sticks. Ah, ma tear, vot I lost by that transaction! Vy, there vosn\u0027t enough to clear me in a sixth part of vot I\u0027d advanced to Tony.\" \"Well, I\u0027m not here to enter into that--that was your lookout. But amongst what you took away there was a desk.\" \"Vos there? \u0027Pon my soul I can\u0027t reckleckt; not that I\u0027m goin\u0027 to gainsay you. Vos there a desk, now?\" \"And in it,\" continued Effingham, not seeming to heed him, \"there was an over-due bill for twenty-five pounds accepted by Walter Burgess.\" \"Lord now! Vos there indeed?\" \"Look here, Mr. Lyons. If you don\u0027t know anything, all right. We won\u0027t waste our time or our money, but we\u0027ll go to those who can help us.\" \"Vot a headstrong boy it is! Who said I couldn\u0027t help you? Go on now,--a bill accepted by Walter Burgess?\" \"Exactly. Now that bill\u0027s no use to any one, and we want you to give it to us.\" \"Ha, ha! clever boys, clever boys! Vot large-hearted fellows too, to want to buy a bill that ain\u0027t of any use to any vun! O, vot generous boys!\" \"It\u0027s no use, Griffiths,\" said Effingham angrily; \"he either don\u0027t know or won\u0027t say anything about it.\" \"Steady,\" said Griffiths. \"Come, Mr. Lyons, say you\u0027ve got the stiff, and name your price.\" \"Accepted by Walter Burgess, eh?\" said the old gentleman; \"yes, I reckleckt that bill; O yes, I reckleckt him.\" \"Well now, bring your recklecktion into something practical, and I\u0027ll give you this for that bill,\" said Mr. Effingham, producing a five-pound note. The old Jew\u0027s eyes glistened at the sight of the money; and then his face fell, and he looked horribly disappointed. \"You should have it for that,\" said he; \"you should have it for that, and velcome; only there\u0027s vun little reason vy I can\u0027t make it over to you.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" cried Effingham. \"Vell, it\u0027s a strong reason, as you\u0027ll allow ven I tell it to you. I can\u0027t let you have the bill, because--because I haven\u0027t got it myself.\" Mr. Effingham swore a sharp oath, and even Mr. Griffiths looked disconcerted. \"Come along,\" said the former,--\"we\u0027ve wasted time enough with the pottering old fool, who\u0027s only selling us, and--\" \"Vait a minute,\" said Mr. Lyons, laying his hand on the other\u0027s arm,--\"vait a minute, ma tear. Though I haven\u0027t got the leetle bill myself, perhaps I know who has.\" \"That\u0027s likely enough,\" said Griffiths, \"well, who has?\" \"Ah, that\u0027s tellings, ma tear. I shall vant--just a leetle something to say.\" \"I\u0027ll give this,\" said Effingham, producing a sovereign. \"Vell, it ain\u0027t enough; but you\u0027re such headstrong fellows. There!\" said Mr. Lyons, slipping it into his pocket; \"now do either of you know a gal who was under Tony Butler\u0027s thumb at vun time, but who hated him mortal, and vos very sveet on vun of Tony\u0027s friends?\" \"I do!\" cried Griffiths; \"Lizzie Ponsford.\" \"That\u0027s the same; a fine gal too, a reg\u0027lar fine gal. Vell, I\u0027d no sooner got Tony\u0027s traps over at my place than that gal comes to me, and she says, \u0027You\u0027ve got a desk that b\u0027longed to Tony Butler,\u0027 she says. And ven I says \u0027yes,\u0027 she offered me a pound for it. It vosn\u0027t vuth five shillings; so I knew there vos something in it she vanted, though I\u0027d hunted it through and found nothin\u0027 but old diaries and memorandums and such-like. \u0027I von\u0027t sell it,\u0027 I says. \u0027May I look at it?\u0027 she says. \u0027You may,\u0027 I says; and vith that I fetched it down; and ven she see it, she touched a spring, and out flew a secret drawer vith this bill in it. \u0027Hands off,\u0027 I says, for she vos going to clutch it at vunce. \u0027Let me have it,\u0027 she says; \u0027I\u0027ll pay for it.\u0027 So I looked at it, and saw it had been overdue eighteen months, and reckleckted hearin\u0027 it was all wrong; so I says, \u0027Vot\u0027ll you give?\u0027 \u0027A sovereign,\u0027 she says. \u0027Make it two, and it\u0027s yours,\u0027 I says. So, after a little, she give me two skivs, and she took the bill and valked away vith it.\" Mr. Effingham looked at Griffiths, and the latter returned the glance. \"It would be almost worth another crown to know if these are lies you are telling us, old gentleman,\" said the former; \"but it sounds something like truth. Now one question more. Where is Lizzie Ponsford?\" \"Ah, that beats me. A reg\u0027lar clever gal; nice-looking and reg\u0027lar clever. I\u0027d have given something to find out myself; but it vos all of no use. She vent avay from all the old haunts, and hasn\u0027t been heard of for a long time.
