{"id":38739,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. MR. EFFINGHAM\u0027S PROGRESS.","content":"When Mr. Effingham returned to town after his signal discomfiture at Redmoor by Miss Gillespie, he had only two objects in view: one to prevent Griffiths finding out that he had gone so near to achieving success, but yet had failed; the other to find out whither the young woman, who had so cunningly betrayed him, had betaken herself. The first was not very difficult. The meeting with the object of his search down at a country-house far away in Devon was too improbable to present itself to a far more brilliantly gifted person than Mr. Griffiths; while the receipt of five sovereigns (Sir Charles\u0027s donation had this time been represented at twenty-five pounds only) gave that gentleman an increased opinion of his friend\u0027s powers of persuasion, and rendered him hopeful for the future. The accomplishment of the second object was, however, a different matter. Mr. Effingham\u0027s innate cunning taught him that after all he had said to Miss Gillespie--or Lizzie Ponsford--about the source of his instructions, the company of her old acquaintances--Messrs. Lyons, Griffiths, Crockett, and Dunks--was about the last she would be likely to affect; and yet in their society only would he have opportunities of seeking her. Through the oft-threaded mazes of that tangled web, in and out, from haunt to haunt, Mr. Effingham once more wended his way,--asking every one, prying into every corner, listening to every conversation,--all to no purpose. He began to think that the object of his search must have departed from her original intention, and instead of coming up to London, have halted on the way; but then, what could she have done alone, unaided, without resources, in any provincial town? Mr. Effingham took to frequenting the Devonshire public-houses and coffee-shops,--queer London holes kept by Devonshire people, who yet preserved a little clannish spirit, who took in a Devon paper, and whose houses were houses-of-call for stray children of the far West, sojourning for business or pleasure in London. Many a long talk was there in Long Acre or Smithfield, surrounded by the foetid atmosphere and the dull rumblings of metropolitan life, of the Exe and the Dart, of the wooded coast of Dawlish and the lovely bay of Babbicombe, of purple moor and flashing cataract, of wrestling-matches and pony-fairs. The cads who dropped in for an accidental half-pint stared with wonder at the brown countrymen, on whom the sun-tan yet remained, who talked a language they had never heard, in an accent they could not understand; who had their own jokes and their own allusions, in which the jolly landlord and his wife bore their part, but which were utterly unintelligible to the cockney portion of the customers. In these houses, among the big burly shoulders of the assembled Devonians, Mr. Effingham\u0027s perky little head was now constantly seen. They did not know who he was; but as he was invariably polite and good-natured, took the somewhat ponderous provincial badinage with perfect suavity, and was always ready to drink or smoke with any of them, they tolerated his presence and answered his questions respecting the most recent arrivals from their native county civilly enough. But all was unavailing; to none of them was the personal appearance of Miss Gillespie known. The presence of any stranger in their neighbourhood would not have passed unnoticed; but of the few sojourners who were described to him, none corresponded in the least to that person whom he sought so anxiously. Would she not attempt to persevere in the new line of life which she had filled at Redmoor and succeeded in so admirably? As governess and companion she had been seemingly happy and comfortable; as governess and companion she would probably again try her fortune. Forthwith Mr. Effingham had a wild desire to secure the services of a desirable young person to superintend the studies of his supposititious niece; and Mrs. Barbauldson, who kept a \"governess agency,\" and Messrs. Chasuble and Rotchet, who combined the providing of governesses and tutors with \"scholastic transfers,\" vulgarly known as \"swopping schools,\" the engagement of curates, and the sale of clerical vestments and ecclesiastical brass-ware, were soon familiarized with Mr. Effingham\u0027s frequent presence. He dropped in constantly at their establishments, and took the liveliest interest in the registers, looking through not merely the actual list of candidates for employment, but searching the books for the past three months. He paid his half-crown fees with great liberality, or else the manner in which he used to bounce in and out the waiting-room and examine the features of the ladies there taking their turn to detail the list of their accomplishments to the clerk, was, to say the least of it, irregular, and contrary to the regulations of the establishment. But all to no purpose,--he could learn nothing of any one in the remotest degree resembling Miss Gillespie: his search among the governess-agencies had been as futile as his visits to the Devonshire public-houses, and all Mr. Effingham\u0027s time and trouble had been spent in vain. What should he try next? He really did not know. He had, ever since his visit to Redmoor, been rather shy of Mr. Griffiths, fearing lest that worthy person might learn more than it was necessary, in Mr. Effingham\u0027s opinion, he should know. Griffiths was to him a very useful jackal, and it was not meet that the jackal\u0027s opinion of the lion\u0027s sagacity and strength should be in any way diminished. Chance had so far favoured him that Mr. Griffiths had recently been absent from town, having accepted a temporary engagement of an important character, as occasional croupier, occasional doorkeeper, to a travelling band of gamblers, who were importing the amusing games of French hazard and roulette into some of the most promising towns in the Midland Counties. One night Mr. Effingham was sitting in a very moody state at \"Johnson\u0027s,\" sipping his grog and wondering vaguely what would be the next best move to make in his pursuit of Miss Gillespie, when raising his eyes, they encountered Mr. Griffiths,--Mr. Griffiths, and not Mr. Griffiths. Gone was the tall shiny hat, its place occupied by a knowing billy-cock; gone were the rusty old clothes, while in their place were garments of provincial cut indeed, but obviously costly material; a slouch poncho greatcoat kept Mr. Griffiths\u0027s body warm, while Mr. Griffiths\u0027s boots, very much contrary to their usual custom, were sound and whole, and hid Mr. Griffiths\u0027s feet from the garish eye of day. Moreover, Mr. Griffiths\u0027s manner, usually a pleasing compound of the bearing of Ugolino and the demeanour of the Banished Lord, was, for him, remarkably sprightly. He threw open the swing-door, and brought in his body squarely, instead of butting vaguely in with the tall hat, as was his usual custom; he walked down the centre of the room, instead of shuffling round by the wall; and advancing to the box in which Mr. Effingham was seated in solitary misery, he clapped him on the back and said, \"D\u0027Ossay, my buck, how are you?\" The appearance, the manner, and the swaggering speech had a great effect on Mr. Effingham. He looked up, and after shaking hands with his friend, remarked, \"You\u0027ve been doin\u0027 it up brown, Griffiths,--you have. They must have suffered for this down about Hull and Grimsby, I should think?\" And with a comprehensive sweep of his forefinger he took in Griffiths\u0027s outer man from his hat to his boots. \"Well, it warn\u0027t bad,\" said Mr. Griffiths, with a bland smile. \"The yokels bled wonderful, and the traps kept off very well, considerin\u0027 I\u0027m pretty full of ochre, I am; and so far as a skiv or two goes, I\u0027m ready to stand friend to them as stood friend to me, D\u0027Ossay, my boy. No? Not hard up? Have a drink then, and tell us what\u0027s been going on.\" The drink was ordered, and Mr. Effingham began to dilate on the various phases of his pursuit of Lizzie Ponsford. As he proceeded, Mr. Griffiths went through a series of pantomimic gestures, which with him were significant of attempts to arouse a dormant memory. He rubbed his head, he scratched his ear, he looked up with a singularly vacant air at the pendent gas-light, he regarded his boots as though they were strange objects come for the first time within his ken. At length, when Mr. Effingham ceased, he spoke. \"It must have been her!\" said he, ungrammatically but emphatically, at the same time bringing his fist down heavily on the table to express his assertion. \"What must have been her, Griffiths?\" inquired Mr. Effingham, who was growing irritated by the extremely independent tone of his usually deferential subordinate,--\"why don\u0027t you talk out, instead of snuffling to yourself and makin\u0027 those faces at me? What must have been her?\" Successful though he was for the time being, Mr. Griffiths had been too long subservient to the angry little man who addressed him to be able to shake off his bonds. He fell back into his old state of submission, grumbling as he said: \"You\u0027re a naggin\u0027 me as usual, D\u0027Ossay, you are! Can\u0027t let a cove think for a minute and try and recollect what he\u0027d \u0027eard,--you can\u0027t. What I was tryin\u0027 to bring back was this--there\u0027s a cove as I know, a theatrical gent, gets engagements for lakers and that, and provides managers of provincial gaffs with companies and so on. He was down at Hull, he was, and he come into our place one night with Mr. Munmorency of the T. R. there, as often give us a look up; and when business was over--we was rather slack that night--we went round to his \u0027otel to have a glass. And while we was drinkin\u0027 it and talkin\u0027 over old times, he says to me, \u0027Wasn\u0027t you in a swim with old Lyons and Tony Butler once?\u0027 he says. \u0027Not once,\u0027 I says, \u0027but a good many times,\u0027 I says. \u0027I thought so,\u0027 he says; \u0027and wasn\u0027t there a handsome gal named Ponsford, did a lot of business for them?\u0027 he says. \u0027There was,\u0027 I says; \u0027fortune-tellin\u0027 and Mysterious-Lady business, and all that gaff,\u0027 I says. \u0027That\u0027s it,\u0027 he says; \u0027I couldn\u0027t think where I\u0027d seen her before.\u0027 \u0027When did you see her last?\u0027 I says. \u0027About three weeks ago,\u0027 he says, \u0027she come to me on a matter of business, and claimed acquaintance with me; and though I knew the face and the name, I could not think where I had seen her before.\u0027\" \"Didn\u0027t you ask him anything more about her?\" said Mr. Effingham. \"No, I didn\u0027t. \u0027Twas odd, wasn\u0027t it? but I didn\u0027t. You see I wasn\u0027t on your lay then, D\u0027Ossay, my boy, and I was rather tired with hookin\u0027 in the \u0027arf-crowns and calclatin\u0027 the bettin\u0027 on the ins and outs, and I was enjoyin\u0027 my smoke and lookin\u0027 forward to my night\u0027s rest.\" \"What a sleepy-headed cove you are, Griffiths!\" said Mr. Effingham with great contempt. \"What do you tell me this for, if this is to be the end?\" \"But this ain\u0027t to be the end, D\u0027Ossay, dear! Mr. Trapman\u0027s come back by this time, I dessay, and we\u0027ll go and look him up to-morrow and see whether he can tell us anything of any real good about this gal. He\u0027s a first-rate hand is Trapman, as knowin\u0027 as a ferret; and it won\u0027t do to let him know what our game is, else he might go in and spoil it and work it for himself. So just you hold your tongue, if we see him, D\u0027Ossay, and leave me to manage the palaver with him.\" Mr. Effingham gave an ungracious assent to his companion\u0027s suggestion, and, practical always, asked him to name a time for this meeting on the next day. Mr. Griffiths suggested twelve o\u0027clock as convenient for a glass of ale and a biscuit, and for finding Mr. Trapman at home. So the appointment was made for that hour; and after a little chat on subjects irrelevant to the theme of this story, the worthy pair parted. The biscuit and the--several--glasses of ale had been discussed the next day, and Mr. Griffiths was maunderingly hinting his desire to remain at Johnson\u0027s for some time longer, when Mr. Effingham, burning with impatience, and with the semblance of authority in him, insisted upon his quondam parasite, but present equal, convoying him to the interview with Mr. Trapman. Mr. Trapman\u0027s Dramatic Agency Office, so notified in blue letters on a black board, was held at the Pizarro Coffee-house in Beak Street, Drury Lane. A dirty, bygone, greasy, used-up little place the Pizarro Coffee-house, with its fly-blown playbills banging over its wire-blind, its greasy coffee-stained lithograph of Signor Poleno, the celebrated clown, with his performing dogs; its moss-covered basket, which looked as if it had been made in a property-room, containing two obviously fictitious eggs. The supporters of the Pizarro were Mr. Trapman\u0027s clients, and Mr. Trapman\u0027s clients became perforce supporters of the Pizarro. When an actor was, as he described it, \"out of collar,\" he haunted Beak Street, took \"one of coffee and a rasher\" at the Pizarro, and entered his name on Mr. Trapman\u0027s books. The mere fact of undergoing that process seemed to revivify him at once. He was on Trapman\u0027s books, and would probably be summoned at an hour\u0027s notice to give \u0027em his Hamlet at South Shields: a capital fellow, Trapman!--safe to get something through him; and then the candidate for provincial histrionic honour would poodle his hair under his hat and take a glance at himself in the strip of looking-glass that adorned the window of the Roscius\u0027 Head, and would wonder when that heiress who should see him from the stage-box O.P., and faint on her mother\u0027s neck, exclaiming, \"Fitzroy Bellville for my husband, or immediate suicide for me!\" would arrive. There was a strange clientèle always gathered round Mr. Trapman\u0027s door so long as the great agent was visible, viz. from ten till five; old men in seedy camlet cloaks with red noses and bleared eyes--\"heavy fathers\" these--and cruel misers and villanous stewards and hard-swearing admirals and libertine peers; dark sunken-eyed gray men, with cheeks so blue from constant shaving that they look as if they had been stained by woad; virtuous and vicious lovers; heroes of romance and single walking-gentlemen; comic men with funny faces and funny figures, ready to play the whole night through from six till twelve, in four pieces, and to interpolate a \"variety of singing and dancing\" between each; portly matrons--Emilias and Belvideras now-who have passed their entire life upon the stage, and who at five years of age first made their appearance as flying fairies; sharp wizen-faced little old ladies, who can still \"make-up young at night,\" and who are on the lookout for the smart soubrette and singing-chambermaid\u0027s line; and heavy tragedians--these most difficult of all to provide for-with books full of testimonials extracted from the potential criticisms of provincial journals. The ladies looked in, made their inquiries as to \"any news,\" and went away to their homes again; but the gentlemen remained about all day long, lounging in Beak Street, leaning against posts, amicably fencing together with their ashen sticks, gazing at the playbills of the metropolitan theatres, and wondering when their names will appear there. Through a little knot of these upholders of the mirror, Mr. Effingham and Mr. Griffiths made their way up the dark dirty staircase past the crowded landing, until they came into the sanctuary of the office. Here was a dirty-faced boy acting as clerk, who exhibited a strong desire to enter their names and requirements in a large leather-covered book before him; but Griffiths caught sight of Mr. Trapman engaged in deep and apparently interesting conversation with a short dark man in a braided overcoat, and a telegraphic wink of recognition passed between them. As it was the boy\u0027s duty to notice everything, he saw the wink, and left them without further molestation, until Mr. Trapman had got rid of his interlocutor, and had come over to talk to them. \"Well, and how are you?\" said he, slapping Mr. Griffiths on the back.--\"Servant, sir,\" to Mr. Effingham.--\"And how are you?\" Slaps repeated. \"Fust rate,\" said Mr. Griffiths, poking him in the ribs. \"This is Mr. Effingham, friend of mine, and a re-markably downy card!\" Wouldn\u0027t be a friend of yours if he wasn\u0027t, said Mr. Trapman, with another bow to D\u0027Ossay. \"Well, and what\u0027s up? Given up the gaff, I suppose. Seven to nine! all equal!--no more of that just now, eh?\" \"No; not in town. Sir Charles Rowan and Colonel Mayne at Scotland Yard, they know too much,--they do. No; I ain\u0027t here on business.\" \"No?\" said Mr. Trapman playfully. \"I thought you might be goin in for the heavy father, Griffiths, or the comic countryman, since your tour in the provinces.\" Mr. Griffiths grinned, and declared that Mr. Trapman was \"a chaffin\u0027 him.\" \"My friend, Mr. D\u0027Ossay--Effingham is more in that line,\" he said; \"a neat figure, and a smart way he\u0027s got.\" \"Charles Surface, Mercushow, Roderigo,--touch-and-go comedy,--that\u0027s his line,\" said Mr. Trapman, glancing at Mr. Effingham. \"One fi\u0027-pun-note of the Bank of England, and he opens at Sunderland next week.\" Mr. Effingham had been staring in mute wonder at this professional conversation; but he understood the last sentence, and thought enough time had been spent in discussing what they didn\u0027t want to know. So he put on his impetuous air and said to Griffiths, \"Go in at him now!\" Thus urged, and taking his cue at once, Mr. Griffiths said, \"No, no; you\u0027ve mistaken our line. What we want of you is a little information. Oh, we\u0027re prepared to pay the fee!\" he added, seeing Mr. Trapman\u0027s face grow grave under a rapid impression of wasted time; \"only--no fakement; let\u0027s have it gospel, or not at all.\" \"Fire away!\" said Mr. Trapman. \"I\u0027m here to be pumped--for a sovereign!\" The coin was produced, and handed over. \"Now,\" said Mr. Trapman, having tested it with his teeth, and then being satisfied, stretched out his arm in imitation of a pump-handle, \"go to work!\" \"You recollect,\" said Griffiths, \"telling me, when we met down at Hull, that one of our old lot had been to see you lately--a girl called Lizzie Ponsford.\" \"I do perfectly.\" \"It\u0027s about her we want to know--that\u0027s all.\" \"It ain\u0027t much to tell, but it was curous,--that it was. It\u0027s six weeks ago now, as I was a-sittin\u0027 in this old shop, finishin\u0027 some letters for the post, when I looked up and saw a female in the doorway with a veil on. I was goin\u0027 on with my letters, takin\u0027 no notice, for there\u0027s always somebody here, in and out all day they are, when the female lifted up her finger first warning-like, like the ghosts on the stage, and then pointin\u0027 to Tom, the boy there, motioned that he should go out of the room. I was a little surprised; for though I had enough of that sort of thing many years ago, I\u0027ve got out of it now. I thought it was a case of smite; I did indeed. However, I sealed up the letters, and told Tom to take \u0027em to the post; and then the female came in, shuttin\u0027 the door behind her. When she lifted her veil, I thought I knew the face, but couldn\u0027t tell where; however she soon reminded me of that first-rate gaff, in--where was it?--out Oxford Street way, where she did the Mysterious Lady, and Seenor Cocqualiqui the conjurin\u0027, and Ted Spicer sung comic songs. I remembered her at once then, and asked her what she wanted. \u0027An engagement,\u0027 she says. \u0027All right,\u0027 I says; \u0027what for?\u0027 \u0027Singin\u0027-chambermaid, walkin\u0027-lady, utility, anything,\u0027 she says. \u0027Walkin\u0027-lady, to grow into leadin\u0027 high comedy, \u0027s your line, my dear,\u0027 I says: \u0027you\u0027re too tall for chambermaids, and too good for utility. Now, let\u0027s look up a place for you.\u0027 I was goin\u0027 to my books, but she stopped me. \u0027I don\u0027t want a place,\u0027 she says; \u0027I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to stop in England; all I want from you,\u0027 she says, \u0027is two or three letters of introduction to managers in New York. You\u0027ve seen me before the public; and though you\u0027ve never seen me act, you could tell I wasn\u0027t likely to be nervous or stammer, or forget my words.\u0027 \u0027No fear of that,\u0027 I says. \u0027Very well then,\u0027 she says, \u0027as I don\u0027t want to hang about when I get there, but want them to give me an appearance at once, just you write me the letters, and\u0027--puttin\u0027 two sovereigns on the table--\u0027make \u0027em as strong as you can for the money.\u0027 Oh, a clever girl she is! I sat down to write the letters, and in the middle of the first I looked up, and I says, \u0027The bearer, Miss ----, what name shall I say?\u0027 \u0027Leave it blank, Mr. Trapman, please,\u0027 says she, burstin\u0027 out laughin\u0027; \u0027I haven\u0027t decided what my name\u0027s to be,\u0027 she says; \u0027and when I have, I think I can fill it in so that no one will know it ain\u0027t your writin\u0027.\u0027 So I gave her the letters and she went away; and that\u0027s my story.\" Mr. Griffiths looked downhearted, and was apparently afraid that his patron would imagine he had not had his money\u0027s worth; but Mr. Effingham, on the contrary, seemed in much better spirits, and thanked Mr. Trapman, and proposed an adjournment to the Rougepot close by in Salad Yard, where they had their amicable glasses of ale, and discussed the state of the theatrical profession generally. When they had bidden adieu to Mr. Trapman and were walking away together, Mr. Griffiths reverted to the subject of Miss Ponsford. \"There\u0027s an end of that little game, I s\u0027pose,\" said he; \"that document\u0027s lost to us for ever.\" \"Wait!\" said Mr. Effingham, with a grin; \"I ain\u0027t so sure of that. She\u0027s gone to New York, you see; now I know every hole and corner in New York, and I\u0027m known everywhere there, as well as any Yankee among them. I could hunt her up there fifty times easier than I could in London.\" \"I daresay,\" said Mr. Griffiths; \"but you see there\u0027s one thing a trifle against that; you ain\u0027t in New York.\" \"But I could go there, I s\u0027pose, stoopid!\" \"Yes; but how, stoopid? You can\u0027t pad the hoof over the sea; and them steamers lay it on pretty thick, even in the steerage.\" \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to America within the next week, Griffiths, and I intend a friend of mine to pay for my passage.\" \"What! the Bart. again?\" \"Exactly. The Bart. again!\" \"And what game are you goin\u0027 to try on with him now?\" \"Ah, Griffiths, that\u0027s my business, my boy. All you\u0027ve got to do is to say goodbye to your D\u0027Ossay to-night, for he\u0027s got to journey down to that thunderin\u0027 old Devonshire again to-morrow; and before a week\u0027s out he intends to be on the briny sea.\" For the second time Mr. Effingham travelled down to Redmoor, and obtained an interview with Sir Charles Mitford. He found that gentleman very stern and haughty on this occasion; so Mr. Effingham comported himself with great humility. \"Now, sir,\" said Sir Charles, \"you\u0027ve broken your word for the second time. What do you want now?\" \"I\u0027m very sorry, Sir Charles--no intention of givin\u0027 offence, Sir Charles; but--\" \"You\u0027ve not got that--that horrible bill?\" \"N-no, Sir Charles, I haven\u0027t; but--\" \"Then what brings you here, sir? more extortion?--a further attempt to obtain money under false pretences?\" \"No, no; don\u0027t say that, Sir Charles. I\u0027ll tell you right off. I may as well make a clean breast of it. I can\u0027t find that document anywhere. I don\u0027t know where it is; and I\u0027m sick of cadgin\u0027 about and spongin\u0027 on you. You know when I first saw you up in town I told you I\u0027d come from America. I was a fool to leave it. I did very well there; and I want to go back.\" \"Well, sir?\" \"Well, just as a last chance, do that for me. I\u0027ve been true to you; all that business of the young woman I managed first-rate--\" \"I paid you for it.\" \"So you did; but try me once again.\" \"Tell me exactly what you want now.\" \"Pay my passage out. Don\u0027t even give me the money; send some cove to pay it, and bring the ticket to me; and he can come and see me off, if he likes, and give me a trifle to start with on the other side of the water; and you\u0027ll never hear of me again.\" Sir Charles reflected a few moments; then said, \"Will you go at once?\" \"At once-this week; sooner the better.\" \"Have you made any inquiries about ships?\" \"There\u0027s one sails from Liverpool on Friday.\" \"On Friday-and to-day is Saturday; just a week. I shan\u0027t trust you in the matter, Mr. Butler,\" said Sir Charles, taking up a letter lying on the table. \"I shall adopt that precaution which you yourself suggested. A friend of mine, coming through from Scotland, will be in Liverpool on Wednesday night. Yes,\" he added, referring to the letter, \"Wednesday night. I\u0027ll ask him to stop there a day, to take your ticket and to see you sail; and with the ticket he shall give you twenty pounds.\" Mr. Effingham was delighted; he had succeeded better even than he had hoped, and he commenced pouring out his thanks. But Sir Charles cut him very short, saying: \"You will ask for Captain Bligh at the Adelphi Hotel; and recollect, Mr. Butler, this is the last transaction between us;\" and he left the room. \"For the present, dear sir,\" said Mr. Effingham, taking up his hat; \"the last transaction for the present; but if our little New York expedition turns you and I will meet again on a different footing.\" On the Friday morning Mr. Effingham sailed from Liverpool for New York in the fast screw-steamer Pocahontas, his ticket having been taken and the twenty pounds paid to him on board by Captain Bligh, who stood by leaning against a capstan while the vessel cleared out of dock. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3078/85032.html","bookId":966,"book":{"id":966,"title":"Running the Gauntlet","description":"简介： Throughout the length and breadth of this London of ours there were few legal firms, no matter of how old standing, doing a better, larger ready-money business than that of Moss and Moss of Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane.
