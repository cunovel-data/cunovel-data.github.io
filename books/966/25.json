{"id":38740,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. A CRISIS AT REDMOOR.","content":"When Mrs. Hammond left the dinner-table on the evening destined to add a new sorrow to Georgie Mitford\u0027s sorely-troubled lot, she really had gone, as she had announced her intention of going, to her husband\u0027s room. The old man was lying in his bed, propped up with pillows, his face turned to the large window, through which the rays of the moon were shining, and mingling in a cold and ghastly manner with the light in the room. The invalid had a fancy for seeing the dark clumps of trees on the rising grounds, and the cold moon shining over their heads. Gifford, his confidential servant, sat at the bed\u0027s head, and had been reading to his master. Mrs. Hammond asked him several questions in a tone of interest which sounded almost genuine as to how Mr. Hammond had been; and then saying she meant to remain with the invalid for a while, she dismissed him, and took her seat by the window, in a position enabling her to see quite distinctly a portion of the broad carriage-drive to the right of the entrance, across which the rays of the moon flung their uninterrupted radiance. Laura did not exert herself much for the amusement of the invalid. The few questions he asked her she answered listlessly, then sunk into silence. After a short time her stepdaughter came softly into the room to bid her father goodnight. \"You are rather late, Alice; where have you been?\" said Laura, without turning her head towards the child, still looking fixedly at the patch of ground in the moonlight. \"With Lady Mitford, mamma,\" answered Alice. \"Have the gentlemen left the dining-room?\" \"Lord Dollamore came into the drawing-room, and I saw Sir Charles crossing the hall into the library; but I don\u0027t know about the others,\" answered Alice. Mrs. Hammond said no more; and Alice, having received an affectionate embrace from her father, and the coldest conceivable touch of Mrs. Hammond\u0027s lips on the edge of her cheek, went off to bed. The silence continued in the sick man\u0027s room, and Laura\u0027s gaze never turned from the window. At length a figure passed across the moonlit space, and was instantly lost in the darkness beyond. Then Mrs. Hammond drew down the blind, and changed her seat to a chair close by the bedside. She took up the book which Gifford had laid down, and asked her husband if he would like her to read on. \"If you please, my dear,\" said Mr. Hammond, \"if it won\u0027t tire you; and you won\u0027t mind my falling asleep, which I may do, for I feel very drowsy.\" Laura was quite sure it would not tire her to read, and she would be delighted if her reading should have so soothing an effect. \"If I do fall asleep, you must not stay with me, Laura; you must go downstairs again. Promise me you will; and you need not call Gifford,--I don\u0027t require any one; I am much better to-night.\" Very well; Laura would promise not to stay in his room if he should fall asleep; and as she really did think him very much better, she would not summon Gifford. Mrs. Hammond possessed several useful and attractive accomplishments; among others, that of reading aloud to perfection. She did not exhibit her skill particularly on this occasion--her voice was languid and monotonous; and the author would have had ample reason to complain had he heard his sentences rendered so expressionless. She read on and on, in a sullen monotone; and after a quarter of an hour had elapsed, she had the pleasure of seeing that her kind intention was fulfilled. Her voice had been very soothing, and her husband had fallen into a profound sleep. Then she passed through an open door into her dressing-room, and reappeared, wrapped in a dark warm cloak, the hood thrown over her head. If any one had taken the place she had so lately occupied at the window, that person would have seen, after the lapse of a few moments, a second figure flit across the moonlit space, and disappear into the darkness beyond. About half an hour later Banks tapped at the door of the smoking-room, and was gruffly bidden to \"come in\" by Captain Bligh. \"If you please, Captain,\" said Banks, upon whom the atmosphere of that particular apartment always produced a distressingly-choky and eye-smarting effect,--\"if you please, Captain, I can\u0027t find Sir Charles. He ain\u0027t in the library, nor yet in the droring-room, and he\u0027s wanted very particular.\" \"Perhaps he has gone up to see Mr. Hammond,\" suggested Bligh. \"No, Captain, he ain\u0027t; I\u0027ve bin and ast Gifford, and he says as his missis has been along o\u0027 the old gentleman since dinner-time, and she\u0027s there now, and nobody ain\u0027t with them.\" \"That\u0027s odd,\" said Captain Bligh; \"but who wants him? Perhaps I might do.\" \"I beg your pardon, Captain,\" said the peremptory Banks, \"but nobody won\u0027t do but Sir Charles hisself. It\u0027s a party as has been sent up from Fishbourne, where my lady comes from, and his orders is to see Sir Charles alone, and not to let out his message to nobody else.\" The good-natured Captain looked extremely grave. Only one occurrence could have rendered so much precaution necessary, and he conjectured at once that that occurrence had taken place. \"I fear Mr. Stanfield is dead,\" he said to his companions. \"I must go and find Mitford. Just excuse me for a while, and make yourselves comfortable here, will you?--Come with me, Banks, and take care your mistress gets no hint of this person\u0027s being here.\" \"There ain\u0027t no fear of that, Captain,\" replied the man; \"my lady\u0027s in the droring-room, along o\u0027 Lord Dollamore; and I knew that Sir Charles worn\u0027t there, so I didn\u0027t go to look for him.\" The Captain found the messenger in the library, where Banks had sent him to await Sir Charles\u0027s appearance. He was a respectable elderly man, and he answered Captain Bligh\u0027s inquiry at once. He had been sent by poor Georgie\u0027s old friend, the curate, to convey to Sir Charles Mitford the melancholy intelligence of Mr. Stanfield\u0027s death, which had taken place early that morning; and particulars of which event were contained in a letter which he was charged to deliver to the Baronet. He had received special injunctions to communicate the event to Sir Charles alone, and leave it to be \"broken\" to Lady Mitford by her husband. The simple curate had little thought how difficult Sir Charles would find it to assume even a temporary sympathy with the feelings of his wife. Captain Bligh ordered refreshments to be served to the bringer of evil tidings; requested him not to communicate with any of the other servants; and strictly enjoining Banks to secrecy, went out of the front door and into the shrubbery on the left of the house. Mitford was not unaccustomed to take fits of sullen moodiness at times, and the Captain thought that he might perhaps find him walking about and smoking, in all the enjoyment of his ill-humour. The intelligent Banks had asked Gifford if he thought it likely that Sir Charles was in his master\u0027s room, in the presence of several of the ladies and gentlemen of the household, assembled in a comfortable and spacious apartment which the insolence of a dominant class caused to be known as the servants\u0027-hall. Among the number of those who heard the question and its answer was Mademoiselle Marcelline, Mrs. Hammond\u0027s \"own maid.\" She was a trim-looking French girl, who had not anything remarkable in her appearance except its neatness, or in her manner except its quietness. She was seated at a large table, on which a number of workboxes were placed, for the women-servants at Redmoor greatly affected needlework, and had a good deal of time to devote to it; and she was embroidering a collar with neatness, dexterity, and rapidity, eminently French. Mademoiselle Marcelline made no observation, and did not raise her eyes, or discontinue her work for a moment, during the discussion as to where Sir Charles could be, which had ensued upon Banks\u0027s inquiry. She had spoken only once indeed since his entrance. When Gifford had said Sir Charles Mitford could not be in Mr. Hammond\u0027s room, because her mistress had been, and was there still, he had asked, \"Isn\u0027t she there still, mam\u0027selle?\" Mam\u0027selle had answered, \"Yes, Monsieur Giffore, madame is there still.\" Mademoiselle Marcelline was so very quiet a little person, and differed so much from French ladies\u0027-maids in general, by the unobtrusiveness of her manners and her extreme taciturnity--to be sure she spoke very little English, but that circumstance is rarely found to limit the loquacity of her class--that her exit from the servants\u0027-hall was scarcely noticed, when she presently looked at her little Geneva watch, made up her embroidery into a tidy parcel, and went away with her usual noiseless step. Mademoiselle Marcelline mounted the stairs with great deliberation, and smiling a little, until she reached the corridor into which the suite of apartments occupied by the Hammonds opened. The rooms were five in number, and each communicated with the other. They were two bed-rooms, two dressing-rooms, and a bath-room. The latter occupied the central space, and had no external door. Mademoiselle Marcelline entered the last room of the suite, corresponding with that in which Mr. Hammond lay,--this was Laura\u0027s bed-room,--and gently locked the door. She passed through the adjoining apartment--her mistress\u0027s dressing-room--and paused before a large wardrobe, without shelves, in which hung a number of dresses and cloaks. She opened the doors, but held them one in each hand, looked in for a moment, and then shut them, and smiled still more decidedly. Then she softly locked the door of this room which opened into the corridor, and passing through the bath-room secured that of Mr. Hammond\u0027s dressing-room also; after which, with more precaution against noise than ever, she glided into the old man\u0027s room. He was sleeping soundly still, and his face looked wasted and ashen in the abstraction of slumber. Mademoiselle Marcelline glanced at him, shrugged her shoulders, sat down on a couch at the foot of the bed, where she was effectually screened from view by the heavy carved bedpost and the voluminous folds of the purple curtain, and waited. Meantime, Captain Bligh had not succeeded in finding Sir Charles, though he had sought for him in the shrubbery and in the stable-yard. He could not make out whither he had gone, and returned to the house to take counsel with Banks. That functionary suggested that Sir Charles might have gone up to the keeper\u0027s house; and though the Captain could not imagine why Sir Charles should have gone thither at such an inconvenient time, as he had no other to offer, he accepted this suggestion, and said he would go thither and look for him. \"Shall I go with you, Captain?\" asked Banks, who felt curious to discover what \"Mitford was up to.\" Since Mr. Effingham\u0027s visit, and the polite fiction of the yacht--endeared to Mr. Banks by his own joke about the Fleet Prison, which he considered so good that society was injured by its suppression within his own bosom--the incredulous flunkey had experienced an increased share of the curiosity with which their masters\u0027 affairs invariably inspire servants. He was much pleased then that Captain Bligh answered, \"Yes, yes, you can come with me.\" The keeper\u0027s cottage was not very far from the great house, from which, however, it was entirely hidden by a thick fir-plantation which covered a long and wide space of undulating land, and through which several narrow paths led to the open ground beyond. The Captain and his attendant struck into one of those paths, which led directly in the direction of the keeper\u0027s house. \"We can\u0027t miss Sir Charles, I think, if he really has gone up to Hutton\u0027s,\" said the Captain. \"No, sir, I think not, unless he has taken a very roundabout way,\" answered Banks. They walked quickly on for some distance, the Captain\u0027s impatience momentarily increasing, and also his doubts that Mitford had gone in this direction at all. At length they reached a point at which the path, cutting the plantation from east to west, was intersected by one running from north to south. Here they paused, and the Captain said testily, \"By Jove, Banks, I hardly know what to do. The messenger from Fishbourne\u0027s shut up in the library all this time, and all the servants in a fuss, and Sir Charles not forthcoming! I wish I had broken the news of her father\u0027s death to Lady Mitford before I came out; it would have been by far the best plan. She\u0027s sure to hear it by accident now.\" The Captain spoke to himself rather than to the servant, and in a particularly emphatic voice--a testimony to his vexation. Then he strode onwards with increased speed, little knowing that he had spoken within the startled hearing of the man whom he was seeking, and who was so near him, as he stood where the paths met, that he could have touched him by stretching out his arm,--touched him and his cowering frightened companion. They kept a breathless silence until the Captain and Banks were quite out of hearing. Then Sir Charles said: \"What is to be done? Did you hear what Bligh said, Laura? Some one has been sent from Fishbourne to tell me that Mr. Stanfield is dead, and they are searching for me everywhere. What a cursed accident! There is not a chance of concealing your absence. My darling, my life, what is to be done?\" She was very pale and trembling, and the words came hard and hoarse, as she replied, \"I know not. If we must brave it out we must; but there is a chance yet. Do you stay here, and meet Bligh as he comes back; you can be strolling along the cross path. Have you a cigar? No; you are in dinner-dress, of course. Stay; you have an overcoat on; search the pockets. Yes, yes; what luck! Here\u0027s a cigar-case, and your light-box hangs to your chain,--I\u0027ll never call it vulgar again,--light a cigar at once, and contrive to show the light when you hear them. I will go to the house. You left the side window open, did you not?\" \"Yes, yes.\" His agitation was increasing; hers was subsiding. \"If I can get into the house unseen, all is right. I can pass through my own rooms into Hammond\u0027s. Send there for me if all is safe; the servants think I am there.\" She turned away to leave him; but he caught her in his arms, and said in a tone of agony, \"Laura! Laura! if I have exposed you to danger--if--\" \"Hush!\" she said, disengaging herself; \"you have not exposed me to danger any more than I have exposed myself; but don\u0027t talk of this as a hopeless scrape until we know that there is no way out of it.\" She was out of sight in an instant. Mademoiselle Marcelline sat at the foot of Mr. Hammond\u0027s bed without the least impatience. She did not fidget, she did not look at the clock, she did not doze. The time passed apparently to her perfect satisfaction. The invalid slept on very peacefully, and the whole scene wore an eminently comfortable aspect. At length her acute ears discerned a light footfall at the end of the corridor, and then she heard the handle of Mrs. Hammond\u0027s dressing-room door gently turned--in vain. Then the footstep came on, and another door-handle was turned, equally in vain. Mademoiselle Marcelline smiled. \"It would have been so convenient for madame to have hung her cloak up and smoothed her hair before monsieur should see her, after madame\u0027s promenade in the clear of the moon,\" thought Mademoiselle Marcelline. \"What a pity that those tiresome doors should unhappily be locked! What a sorrowful accident!\" The door opened, and Laura looked cautiously into the room. All was as she had left it; the sleeping face of her husband was turned towards her. The pathetic unconsciousness of sleep was upon it; she did not heed the pathos, but the unconsciousness was convenient. The minutest change that would have intimated that any one had entered the room would not have escaped her notice, but there was no such thing. She came in, and softly closed the heavy perfectly-hung door; she made a few steps forward, uttered a deep sigh of relief, and said in an involuntary whisper, \"What a risk, and what an escape!\" Her heavy cloak hung upon her; she pushed back the hood, and her chestnut hair, in wild disorder, shone with red gleams in the firelight. She lifted her white hands and snatched impatiently at the tasseled cord which held the garment at the throat; and Mademoiselle Marcelline emerged from the shadow of the bed-curtains, and with perfect propriety and an air of entire respect requested that madame would permit her to remove the cloak which was so heavy, and also madame\u0027s boots, which must be damp, for the promenade of evening had inconveniences. Laura started violently, and then stood looking at the demure figure before her with a kind of incredulous terror. Mademoiselle Marcelline composedly untied the refractory cords and removed the mantle, which she immediately replaced in the wardrobe. Would Madame have the goodness to consider what she had said about the boots, and to go into her dressing-room? Madame followed her like one in a dream. She placed a chair before the dressing-table, and Laura mechanically sat down; she took off her boots and substituted slippers; she restored the symmetry of the crushed dress; she threw a dressing-gown over the beautiful shoulders, folded it respectfully over the bosom heaving with terror and anger, and began to brush her mistress\u0027s hair with a wholly unperturbed demeanour. Laura looked at the demure composed face which appeared over her shoulder in the glass, and at length she said: \"How came you in that room?\" \"Ah, madame, what a happy chance! One came to the salon of the servants, and demanded of Monsieur Giffore if Sir Charles might be in the chamber of monsieur. Then Monsieur Giffore say that no; that madame was there, and is there. And Monsieur Giffore asked me if he have reason; and I say, \u0027Certainly, madame is still in the chamber of monsieur.\u0027\" \"Well,\" said Laura, for Mademoiselle Marcelline had paused, \"what has that to do with your being in that room?\" \"It has much, if madame will take the trouble to listen. I know that servants are curious,--ah, how curious servants are, my God!--and I thought one of them might have curiosity enough to see for herself madame, so affectionate, passing the long, long evening with poor monsieur, who is not gay,--no, he is not gay, they say that in the salon of the servants. So, as it is not agreeable to be listened and spied, and as servants are so curious, I locked the doors of the rooms consecrated to the privacy of madame, and rejoiced to know that madame might read excellent books of exalted piety to monsieur, or refresh her spirits, so tired by her solicitude, with a promenade in the clear of the moon--madame is so poetic!--as she chose, without being teased by observation. I respect also that good Monsieur Giffore, and I would not have him disprove. \u0027Madame is still there, mam\u0027sell?\u0027 he asks; and I say, \u0027Yes; madame is still there.\u0027\" All the time she was speaking, Mademoiselle Marcelline quietly pursued her task. The long silken tresses lay now in a well-brushed shining heap over her left arm, and she looked at them with complacent admiration. \"Heaven! but madame has beautiful hair!\" she went on, while Laura, pale and motionless, at taking into her heart the full meaning of this terrible complication of her position. \"It is, however, fortunate that she does not adopt the English style, for promenades at the clear of the moon are enemy to curls--to those long curls which the young ladies, lastly gone away, and who were so fond of madame, wore. They avoided the damp of the forest in the evening, the young ladies; they were careful of their curls. But madame has not need to be careful of anything--nothing and nobody can hurt madame, who is so beloved by monsieur. Ah, what a destiny! and monsieur so rich!\" She had by this time braided the shining hair, and was dexterously folding the plaits round and round the small head, after a fashion which Laura had lately adopted. Still her mistress sat silent, with moody downcast eyes. As she interrupted her speech for a moment to take a fresh handful of hair-pins from the dressing-table, Banks knocked at the door of the adjoining room. Mademoiselle Marcelline did not raise her voice to bid him enter; always considerate, she remembered that an indiscreet sound might trouble the repose of the invalid, so she stepped gently to the door and opened it. \"Is Mrs. Hammond here, mam\u0027sell?\" asked Banks. \"Oh, but yes, Monsieur Banks, madame is always here.\" \"Not exactly,\" thought Banks, puzzled by her idiom; but he merely said, \"Bad news has reached the family. My lady\u0027s father is dead, which he was a good old gentleman indeed; and she ain\u0027t seen him neither, not for some time; and my lady she\u0027s been a faintin\u0027 away in the libery like anythin\u0027; and Sir Charles, he\u0027s been a holdin\u0027 of her hup, leastways him and Lord Dollamore, and there\u0027s the deuce to pay down there.\" Mademoiselle listened with polite attention to Mr. Banks\u0027s statement of the condition of affairs; but she was not warmly interested. \"Monsieur Banks will pardon me,\" she said; \"but at present I coif madame; I think he demanded madame?\" \"Yes, I did, marm\u0027sell,\" said Banks, abashed and convicted by this quiet little person of undue loquacity; \"only I thought you\u0027d like to hear. Mostly servants does; but,\" here Mr. Banks floundered again, \"you ain\u0027t much like the rest of us, miss--mam\u0027sell, I mean.\" Mademoiselle Marcelline acknowledged the compliment with a very frigid smile, and again inquired what she might have the pleasure of telling madame, on the part of Monsieur Banks. \"Sir Charles begs Mrs. Hammond will come down to the libery if quite convenient to her, as he wishes to speak to her about some necessary arrangements.\" Mr. Banks delivered his message with elaboration, and waited the reply with dignity. Mademoiselle Marcelline repeated the communication to her mistress, word for word, and did not suffer the slightest trace of expression to appear in her face. \"Yes, I will go down immediately,\" said Laura, much relieved at the prospect of escaping from the presence of her maid, and having time to consider her position. Mr. Banks went away to deliver Mrs. Hammond\u0027s message, and mademoiselle, in perfect silence, removed the dressing-gown from her mistress\u0027s shoulders; and Laura, her dress in complete order, and her nerves to all appearance as well arranged, rose from her chair. \"Give me a lace shawl,\" she said, in her customary imperious manner; \"if Lady Mitford has lost her father, she will not be gratified by my making my appearance in full-dress, and I have no time to change it.\" \"Madame is so considerate,\" remarked Mademoiselle Marcelline, as she folded a web of fine black lace round Mrs. Hammond\u0027s form; \"and Lady Mitford owes her so much. Poor lady, she is sensitive; she has not the courage of madame. Madame must form her.\" \"Go for Gifford to sit with Mr. Hammond,\" said Laura. \"You can wait for me in my room as usual;\" and she walked out of the dressing-room, having previously ordered her maid to unlock the door, without any outward sign of disturbance. Slowly she went down the great staircase, and as she went she asked herself, \"Shall I tell Charles? Could any worse complication arise out of my concealing this dreadful thing from him?\" At length she made up her mind, just as she reached the door of the library. \"No,\" she said, \"I will not tell him. He has no nerve, and would blunder, and the less one tells any man the better.\" Poor Georgie, now indeed lonely and desolate, had been taken to her room, and induced to lie down on her bed, by the housekeeper and her maid, who proposed to watch by their unhappy mistress all night. She and Sir Charles were to proceed to Fishbourne on the following day. She had earnestly entreated her husband to take her with him, and he had consented. She was quite worn-out and stupefied with grief, and had hardly noticed Mrs. Hammond\u0027s presence in the library at all. It was agreed that Lord. Dollamore should leave Redmoor on the following day, a little later than Sir Charles and Lady Mitford, and that the Hammonds should go to Torquay as soon as the physicians would permit their patient to make so great an effort. \"It is impossible to say how soon I shall get back, or how long I may be detained,\" said Sir Charles; \"and it\u0027s a confounded nuisance having to go.\" Lord Dollamore looked at him with tranquil curiosity, and tapped first his teeth and then his ear with his inseparable cane. \"I hope they will make you comfortable here. Bligh will see to everything, I know. Perhaps they won\u0027t let Hammond move at all--very likely, for there\u0027s an east wind--and you\u0027ll be here when we return.\" Very gravely Mrs. Hammond answered him: \"That will be impossible, Sir Charles. Lady Mitford could not possibly be expected to have any one in her house under such circumstances. Mr. Hammond must be brought to Torquay.\" Sir Charles was puzzled; he could not quite understand her tone; he did not think it was assumed entirely, owing to the presence of Lord Dollamore, for that had seldom produced any effect on Laura. No, she was completely in earnest. She gave her hand to each gentleman in turn, but the clasp she bestowed on each was equally warm; and when Sir Charles, as she passed out of the door, shot one passionate glance at her, unseen by Dollamore, she completely ignored it, and walked gracefully away. \"By Jove!\" said Lord Dollamore, when he had gotten rid of Mitford and was safe in his own room, \"it was a lucky thing Buttons made his appearance just when he did. I should have hopelessly committed myself in another minute; and then, on the top of that fine piece of sentiment, we should have had the scene of this evening\u0027s news. No matter how she had taken it, I should have been in an awful scrape. If she had taken it well, I should have had to do a frightful amount of sympathy and condolence--the regular \u0027water-cart business\u0027 in fact; and if she had taken it ill, egad, she\u0027s just the woman to blurt it all out in a fit of conscience, and to believe that her father\u0027s death is a judgment upon her for not showing me up to Mitford! As it is, the matter remains in a highly-satisfactory condition; I am not committed to anything: I might have been pleading my own cause, or a friend\u0027s, or some wholly imaginary personage\u0027s; and I can either resume the argument precisely where I dropped it, if I think proper, or I can cut the whole affair. Bless you, my Buttons!\" As Georgie was driving over to the railway-station on the following day,--her maid and she occupying the inside of the carriage, and Sir Charles, availing himself of his well-known objection to allow any one but himself to drive when he was present, to avoid a tête-à-tête with his wife, on the box,--she raised her heavy veil for a while, and drawing a letter from her pocket, read and re-read it through her blinding tears. It was from Colonel Alsager. At length Georgie put it away, and lay back in the carriage, with closed eyes, thinking of the writer. \"He has suffered a great deal also,\" she thought; \"and he has more to suffer. How sorely he must repent his neglect of his father! as sorely as I repent my neglect of mine.\" Here the tears, which had already burned her eyelids into a state of excruciating soreness, burst forth again. \"What must he have felt when he read his father\u0027s letter!--the letter written to be read after the writer\u0027s death,--the letter he will show to me, he says, though to no one else in the world, except, I suppose, the young lady whom Sir Peregrine entreated him in it to marry. I wonder if he will,--I wonder if she is nice, and good, and likely to make him happy! It is strange that a similar calamity should have befallen him and me. He can feel for my grief now--I have always felt for his!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3078/85033.html","bookId":966,"book":{"id":966,"title":"Running the Gauntlet","description":"简介： Throughout the length and breadth of this London of ours there were few legal firms, no matter of how old standing, doing a better, larger ready-money business than that of Moss and Moss of Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane.
