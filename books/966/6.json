{"id":38721,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. THE GRAYS.","content":"When Laurence Alsager awoke the next morning, he did not regard life with such weariness, nor London with such detestation, as when he went to bed. He had slept splendidly, as would naturally fall to the lot of a man who for two years had been deprived of that greatest of earthly comforts--an English bed. Laurence had bounded on French spring-mattresses; had sweltered beneath German feather-lined coverlets; had cramped himself up in berths; had swung restlessly in hammocks; had stifled behind mosquito curtains; and had passed many nights with his cloak for his bed, and his saddle-bags for his pillow, with the half-naked forms of dirty Arabs dimly visible in the flickering firelight, and the howls of distant jackals ringing in his ears. He had undergone every description of bed-discomfort; and it is not to be wondered at that he lingered long in that glorious nest of cleanliness and rest provided for him at his hotel. As he lay there at his ease, thoroughly awake, but utterly averse to getting up, he began to think over all that had happened during the previous evening; and first he thought what a charming-looking woman Lady Mitford was. The Scotch gentleman who had remarked that Colonel Alsager was \"a deevil among the sax\" had some foundation for his observation; for it was a fact that, from the days when Laurence left Eton and was gazetted to the Coldstreams, until he sold his commission and left England in disgust, his name had always been coupled by the gossips with that of some lady well known either in or out of society. He was a mere boy, slim and whiskerless, when the intense admiration which he excited in the breast of Mdlle. Valentine, combined with what she afterwards termed the \"coldly insular\" manner in which he treated her, gave that charming danseuse such a migraine as rendered her unable to appear in public for a week, and very nearly caused Mr. Lumley to be favoured with a row equal to the celebrated Tamburini riot in the days of M. Laporte. He was not more than twenty when \"Punter\" Blair told him that his goings-on with Lady Mary Blair, the Punter\u0027s sister-in-law, were the talk of the town; and that if her husband, the Admiral, was blind, he, the Punter, wasn\u0027t, as he\u0027d let Alsager pretty soon know. Laurence replied that the Punter had better mind his own business,--which was \"legging\" young boys at écarté and blind-hookey,--and leave his brother\u0027s wife alone; upon which Punter Blair sent O\u0027Dwyer of the 18th with a message; and there must inevitably have been a meeting, had not Blair\u0027s colonel got a hint of it, and caused it to be intimated to Mr. Blair that unless this matter with Mr. Alsager were arranged, he, the colonel, should have to take such notice of \"other matters\" affecting Mr. Blair as would compel that gentleman to send in his papers. So in a score of cases differing very slightly from each other. It was the old story which was lyrically rendered by Dr. Watts, of Satan being always ready to provide congenial occupation for gentlemen with nothing to do. There is not, I believe, very much martial ardour in the Household Brigade just now. That born of the Crimean war has died out and faded away, and the officers have taken to drive off ennui, some by becoming district visitors, and others by enjoying the honest beer and improving conversation of the firemen in Watling Street. But even now there is infinitely more enthusiasm, more belief in the profession as a profession, more study of strategy as a thing which a military man should know something of, than there was before the Crimean expedition. The metropolitan inhabitants had little care for their gallant defenders in those days. Their acquaintance with them was limited to the knowledge that large red men were perpetually discovered in the kitchens, and on discovery were presented as relatives of the servants; or that serious, and in some cases fatal, brawls occurred in the streets, when the pleasant fellows laid about them with their belts, or ran amuck amongst a crowd with their bayonets. An occasional review took place in the Park, or a field-day at Woolwich; but no cordial relations existed between the majority of the Londoners and the household troops until the news came of the battle of the Alma. Then the public learned that the Guards\u0027 officers were to be heard of in other places than ball-rooms and divorce-courts, and that guardsmen could fight with as much untiring energy as they had already displayed in feeding on householders and flirting with cooks. Not much worse, certainly not much better, than his compeers was Laurence Alsager in those days, always having \"something on\" in the way of feminine worship, until the great \"something\" happened, which, according to Jock M\u0027Laren and one or two others, had occasioned the great change in his life, and caused his prolonged absence from England. But in all his experience he had only known women of a certain kind; women of the world, ready to give and take; women, in his relations with whom there had been no spice of romance save that spurious romance of the French-novel school, so attractive at first, so hollow, and bad, and disgusting, when proceeded with. It is not too much to say that, varied as his \"affaires\" had been, he had not known one quiet, pure-minded, virtuous woman; and that during his long foreign sojourn he had thought over this, and often wondered whether he should ever have a wife of his own, or, failing this, whether he should ever have a female friend whom at the same time he could love and respect. Yes, that was the sort of woman, he thought to himself as he lay calmly reflecting. What a good face she had! so quiet and calm and self-possessed. Naturally self-possessed; not that firm disgusting imperturbability which your hardened London coquette has, he thought; like that horrible M\u0027Alister, who puts her double eye-glass up to her eyes and coolly surveys women and men alike, as though they were slaves in the Constantinople market, and she the buyer for the Sultan. There certainly was a wonderful charm about Lady Mitford, and, good heavens! think of a man having such a wife as that, and going off to sup with Bligh and Winton, who were simply two empty-headed roué jackasses, and Pontifex, who--Well, it was very lucky that people didn\u0027t think alike. Yes, that man Mitford was a lout, a great overgrown-schoolboy sort of fellow, who might be led into any sort of scrapes by--By Jove! that\u0027s what Dollamore had said with that horribly cynical grin. And Lady Mitford would have to run the gauntlet of society, as did most women whose husbands went to the bad. Laurence Alsager was a very different man from the Laurence Alsager of two years ago. He wanted something to fill up his leisure time, and he thought he saw his way to it. Dollamore never spoke at random. From his quietly succulent manner Alsager knew that his lordship meant mischief, probably in his own person, at all events hinted plainly enough that--Ah! he would stop all that. He would pit himself against Dollamore, or any of them, and it would be at least a novelty to have a virtuous instead of a vicious end in view. Mitford might be a fool, his wife weak and silly; but there should be no disastrous consequences. Dollamore\u0027s prophecy should be unfulfilled, and he, Laurence Alsager, should be the active agent in the matter. Simultaneously with this determination he decided upon deferring his visit to his father, and settling himself in London for a time. He would be on the spot; he would cultivate the acquaintance which Mitford so readily held out to him; he would have the garrison well under surveillance in order carefully to observe the enemy\u0027s approach; and--The shower-bath cut short his reflections at this point. He dressed and breakfasted; despatched his servant to see if his old rooms in Jermyn Street were vacant; lit a cigar and strolled out. He had at first determined to brave public opinion in every shape and form, to retain his beard, to wear the curious light coats and elaborately puckered trousers which a Vienna Schneider had a year before turned out as prime specimens of the sartorial art. But even to this determination the night\u0027s reflection brought a change, and he found himself turning into Poole\u0027s, and suffering himself to be suited to the very latest cut and colour. Then he must get a hack or two from Saunderson in Piccadilly; and as the nearest way from Poole\u0027s in Saville Row to Saunderson\u0027s in Piccadilly is, as every one knows, down Grosvenor Place and through Eaton Place, that was the way that Laurence Alsager walked. Eaton Place is not a very cheerful thoroughfare at the best of times. Even in the season, when all the houses are full of the domesticity of parliament-members, furnished at the hebdomadal rate of twenty guineas, there is a stuccoey and leading-to-not-much thoroughfares depression about it; but on a January morn, as Laurence saw it, it was specially dull. Sir Charles Mitford had mentioned no number, so that Laurence took a critical survey of each house as he passed, considering whether the lady in whom he had suddenly taken so paternal an interest resided there. He had, however, passed a very few doors when at the other end of the street he saw a low pony-carriage with a pair of iron-gray ponies standing at a door; and just as he noted them, a slight figure, which he recognized in an instant, came down the steps and took up its position in the phaeton. It was Lady Mitford, dressed in velvet edged with sable, with a very little black-velvet bonnet just covering the back of her head (it was before the days of hats), and pretty dogskin driving-gloves. She cast a timid glance at the ponies before she got in (she had always had horsy tastes down at Fishbourne, though without much opportunity of gratifying them), and was so occupied in gathering up the reins, and speaking to the groom at the ponies\u0027 head, as scarcely to notice Laurence\u0027s bow. Then with a view to retrieve her rudeness, she put out her hand, and said cordially: \"How do you do, Colonel Alsager? I beg your pardon; I was taking such interest in the ponies that I never saw you coming up. They\u0027re a new toy, a present from my husband; and that must be my excuse.\" \"There is no excuse needed, Lady Mitford. The ponies are charming. Are you going to drive them?\" \"O yes; why not? Saunderson\u0027s people say they are perfectly quiet; and, indeed, we are going to take them out to the farm at Acton, just to show Mr. Grieve the stud-groom how nicely they look in our new phaeton.\" \"You\u0027re sure of your own powers? They look a little fresh.\" \"Oh, I have not the least fear. Besides, my husband will be with me; I\u0027m only waiting for him to come down, and he drives splendidly, you know.\" \"I\u0027ve a recollection of his prowess as a tandem-whip at Oxford, when the Dean once sent to him with a request that he\u0027d \u0027take the leader off.\u0027 Well, au plaisir, Lady Mitford. I wish you and the two ponies all possible enjoyment.\" And he took off his hat and went on his way. Oh, he was perfectly right; she was charming. He wasn\u0027t sure whether she hadn\u0027t looked better even this morning than last night, so fresh and wholesome. And her manner, without the slightest suspicion of an arrière pensée, free, frank, and ingenuous; how nicely she spoke about her husband and his driving! There could be no mistake about a woman like that. No warping or twisting could torture her conduct into anything assailable. He\u0027d been slightly Quixotic when he thought to give himself work by watching over and defending her; he--\"Good morning, Mr. Spurrier. Recollect me? Mr. Saunderson in?\" Revolving all these things in his mind, he had walked so quickly that he found himself in Piccadilly, and in Mr. Saunderson\u0027s yard, before he knew where he was. \"Delighted to see you back, Colonel. Thought I caught a glimpse of you at the theatre last night, but was doubtful, because of your beard. No; Mr. Saunderson\u0027s gone up to the farm to meet a lady on business; but anything I can do I shall be delighted.\" Mr. Spurrier was Mr. Saunderson\u0027s partner, a very handsome, fresh-coloured, cheery man, who had been in a light-cavalry regiment, and coming into money on the death of a relation, had turned his bequest and his horsy talents to account. There were few such judges of horseflesh; no better rider across country than he. \"Thought you\u0027d be giving us a call, Colonel, unless you\u0027d imported a few Arabs; and gave you credit for better judgment than that. Your Arab\u0027s a weedy beast, and utterly unfit for hacking.\" \"No, Spurrier, I didn\u0027t carry my orientalism to that extent. I might have brought back a clever camel or two, or a dromedary, \u0027well suited for an elderly or nervous rider,\u0027 as they say in the advertisements; but I didn\u0027t. I suppose you can suit me with a hack.\" Mr. Spurrier duly laughed at the first part of this speech, and replied in the affirmative, of course, to the second. \"You haven\u0027t lost much flesh in the East, Colonel,\" said he, running him over with his eye,--\"I should say you pull off twelve stone still.\" Then Mr. Spurrier, as was his wont, made a great show of throwing himself into a fit of abstraction, during the occurrence of which he was supposed by customers to be mentally going through the resources of his establishment; and roused himself by calling the head-groom, and bidding him tell them to bring out the Baby. The Baby was a bright bay with black points, small clean head, short well-cut ears, and a bright eye, arching neck, and, as she showed when trotted up the yard with the groom at her head, splendid action. When she was pulled up and stood in the usual position after the \"show\" had been given, Laurence stepped up, eyed her critically all over, and passed his hand down her legs. Spurrier laughed. \"All right there, Colonel. Fine as silk; not a sign of a puff, I\u0027ll guarantee, and strong as steel. Perfect animal., I call her, for a park-hack.\" A horse was never a \"horse,\" but always an \"animal\" with Mr. Spurrier, as with the rest of his fraternity. \"Will you get on her, Colonel? Just give her a turn in the Park.--Here, take this mare in, and put a saddle and bridle on her for Colonel Alsager.\" It was a bright sunny winter\u0027s day, and the few people in town were taking their constitutional in the Row. As Alsager rode round by the Achilles statue he heard ringing laughter and saw fluttering habits, which, associated with the place in his mind with his last London experiences, brought up some apparently unpleasant recollection as he touched the mare with his heel, and she after two or three capricious bounds, settled down into that long swinging gallop which is such perfect luxury. He brought her back as quietly as she would come, though a little excited and restless at the unaccustomed exercise, and growled a good deal to himself as he rode. \"Just the same; a little more sun, and some leaves on the trees then, and a few more people about; that\u0027s all. Gad! I can see her now, sitting square, as she always used, and as easy on that chestnut brute that pulled so infernally, as though she were in an armchair. Ah! enough has happened since I was last in this place.\" And then he rode the Baby into the yard, asked Mr. Spurrier her price agreed, to take her, told Spurrier he wanted a groom and a groom\u0027s horse, and was sauntering away when Mr. Spurrier said, \"You\u0027ll want something to carry you to hounds, Colonel?\" \"I think not; at all events not this season.\" \"Sorry for that, as I\u0027ve got something up at the farm that would suit You exactly.\" \"No, thank you; where did you say?\" \"At our farm at Acton. You\u0027ve been there, you know.\" \"The farm at Acton,\"--that was where Lady Mitford said she was going to drive. She must be the lady whom Mr. Saunderson had gone to meet. Spurrier saw the irresolution in his customer\u0027s face and acted promptly. \"Let me take you out there; we sha\u0027n\u0027t be twenty minutes going and this is really something you ought not to miss. He\u0027s so good, that I give you my word I wouldn\u0027t sell him to any but a workman. You will? All right!--Put the horses to.\" Within three minutes Laurence Alsager was seated by Mr. Spurrier\u0027s side in a mail-phaeton, spinning along to Mr. Saunderson\u0027s farm and his own fate. There were few whips in London who drove so well or so fast as Mr. Spurrier, and there were none who had better horses, as may be imagined; but Laurence did not find the pace a whit too fast. He had asked Mr. Spurrier on the road, and ascertained from him that it was Lady Mitford who was expected. \"And a charming lady too, sir; so gentle and kind with every one. Speaks to the men here as polite as possible, and they\u0027re not over-used to that; for, you see, in business one\u0027s obliged to speak sharp, or you\u0027d never get attended to. Don\u0027t think she knows much of our line, though she\u0027s dreadfully anxious to learn all about it; for Sir Charles is partial to horseflesh, and is a good judge of an animal. He\u0027s been a good customer to us, and will be better, I expect, though he hasn\u0027t hunted this season, being just married, you see. That\u0027s the regular thing, I find. \u0027You\u0027ll give up hunting, dear? I should be so terrified when you were out.\u0027 \u0027Very well, dear; anything for you;\u0027 and away go the animals to Tattersall\u0027s; and within six months my gentleman will come to me and say, \u0027Got anything that will carry me next season, Spurrier?\u0027 and at it he goes again as hard as ever.\" \"I saw the ponies at the door this morning,\" said Laurence, for the sake of something to say; \"they\u0027re a handsome pair.\" \"Ye-es,\" replied Mr. Spurrier; \"I don\u0027t know very much of them; they\u0027re Mr. Saunderson\u0027s buying. I drove \u0027em once, and thought they wanted making; but Sir Charles is a good whip, and he\u0027ll do that.--Ga-a-te!\" And at this prolonged shout the lodge-gates flew open, and they drove into the stable-yard. Mr. Saunderson was there, but no Lady Mitford. Mr. Saunderson had his watch in his hand, and even the look of gratification which he threw into his face when he greeted Colonel Alsager on his return was very fleeting. There was scarcely a man in London whose time was more valuable, and he shook his head as he said, \"I\u0027ll give her five minutes more, and then I\u0027m off.--What are you going to show the Colonel, Spurrier?\" \"I told them to bring out Launcelot first.\" Mr. Saunderson shook his head \"Too bad, Spurrier, too bad! I told you how the Duke fancied that animal, and how I\u0027d given his Grace the refusal of him.\" \"Well, we can\u0027t keep our business at a standstill for dukes or any one else. Besides, we\u0027ve known the Colonel much longer than the Duke.\" \"That\u0027s true,\" said Mr. Saunderson with a courteous bow to Laurence. \"Well, if Colonel Alsager fancies the animal, I must get out of it with his Grace in the best way I can.\" It was a curious thing, but no one ever bought a horse of Mr. Saunderson that had not been immensely admired by, and generally promised to, some anonymous member of the peerage. \"Easy with him, Martin, easy! Bring him over here.--So, Launcelot, so, boy.\" Launcelot was a big chestnut horse, over sixteen hands high, high crest, long lean head, enormous quarters, powerful legs, and large broad feet. He looked every inch a weight-carrying hunter, and a scar or two here and there about him by no means detracted from his beauty in the eyes of the knowing ones. Martin was the rough-rider to the establishment, bullet-headed, high-cheek-boned, sunken-eyed, with limbs of steel, and pluck which would have made him ram a horse at the Victoria Tower if he had had instructions. As Mr. Spurrier patted the horse\u0027s neck, Martin leant over him and whispered, \"I\u0027ve told one o\u0027 them to come out on Black Jack, sir. This is a \u0027oss that wants a lead, this \u0027oss does. Give \u0027im a lead, and he\u0027ll face anythink.\" \"All right,\" said Spurrier, as another man and horse came out; \"here they are. Go down to the gate in the tan-gallop, will you? put up the hurdles first.--Now, Colonel, this way, please; the grass is rather wet even now.\" They walked across a large meadow, along one side of which from end to end a tan-gallop had been made. Midway across this some hurdles with furze on the top had been stuck up between two gate-posts, and at these the boy on Black Jack rode his horse. A steady-goer, Black Jack; up to his work, and knowing exactly what was expected of him; comes easily up to the hurdles, rises, and is over like a bird. Not so Launcelot, who frets at starting; but moves under Martin\u0027s knees and Martin\u0027s spurs, gives two or three bounds, throws up his head, and is off like a flash of lightning. Martin steadies him a bit as they approach the leap, and Jack\u0027s rider brings his horse round, meets Martin half-way, and at it they go together. Jack jumps again, exactly in his old easy way, but Launcelot tears away with a snort and a rush, and jumps, as Mr. Spurrier says, \"as though he would jump into the next county.\" \"Now the gate!\" says Mr. Spurrier; and the hurdles were removed, and a massive five-barred gate put up between the posts. \"You go first, boy,\" said Spurrier; and Black Jack\u0027s rider, who was but a boy, looked very white in the gills, and very tight in the mouth, and galloped off. But Jack was not meant for a country which grew such gates as that, and when he reached it, turned short round, palpably refusing. Knowing he should get slanged by his master, the boy was bringing him up again, when he heard a warning shout, and looking round, cleared out of the way to let Launcelot pass. Launcelot\u0027s mettle was up; he wanted no lead this time. Martin, with his face impassably set, brought his whip down heavily on him as he lifted him; but Launcelot did not need the blow; he sprang three or four inches clear of the leap in splendid style. \"By George, that\u0027s a fine creature!\" said Laurence, who had all a sportsman\u0027s admiration for the feat. \"I think I must have him, Spurrier, if his figure\u0027s not very awful. But I should first like to take him over that gate myself.\" \"All right, Colonel; I thought he\u0027d, take your fancy.--Get down, Martin, and let down those stirrups a couple of holes for the Colonel, will you?--And you, boy, tumble off there. I\u0027ll see whether that old vagabond will refuse with me.--Ah, you\u0027re a sly old scoundrel, Jack; but I think we\u0027ll clear the gate, old boy!\" Alsager was already in the saddle, and Spurrier was tightening the girths, when the former heard a low rumbling sound gradually growing more distinct. \"What\u0027s that?\" he asked his companion. \"What?\" asked Spurrier, with his head still under the saddle-flap; but when he stood upright and listened, he said, \"That\u0027s a runaway! I know the sound too well; and--and a pair! By the Lord, the grays!\" They were standing close by the hedge which separated the meadow from the road. It was a high quickset hedge, with thick post-and-rail fence running through it, and it grew on the top of a high bank with a six-foot drop into the road. Standing in his stirrups and craning over the hedge, Laurence saw a sight which made his blood run cold. Just having breasted the railway-bridge, and tearing down the incline at their maddest pace, came the grays, and in the phaeton, which swung frightfully from side to side, sat Lady Mitford--alone! A dust-stained form gathering itself up out of the road in the distance looked like a groom; but Sir Charles was not to be seen. Lady Mitford still held the reins, and appeared to be endeavouring to regain command over the ponies; but her efforts were evidently utterly useless. Mr. Spurrier, who had mounted, comprehended the whole scene in a second, and roared out, \"Run, Martin! run, you boy! get out into the lane, and stop these devils! Hoi!\" this to the grooms in the distance, to whom he telegraphed with his whip. \"They don\u0027t understand, the brutes! and she\u0027ll be killed. Here, Colonel, to the right-about! Five hundred yards off there\u0027s a gate, and we can get through and head them. What are you at? you\u0027re never going at the hedge. By G--, you\u0027ll break your neck, man!\" All too late to have any effect were his last words; before they were uttered, Laurence had turned Sir Launcelot\u0027s head, taken a short sharp circling gallop to get him into pace, and then crammed him straight at the hedge. Spurrier says that to his dying day he shall never forget that jump; and he often talks about it now when he is giving a gentleman a glass of sherry, after a \"show\" just previous to the hunting season. Pale as death, with his hat over his brows, and his hands down on the horse\u0027s withers, sat Laurence; and just as Sir Launcelot rose at the leap, he dealt him a cut with a heavy whip which he had snatched out of Spurrier\u0027s hand The gallant animal rose splendidly, cleared posts and rails, crashed through the quickset, and came thundering into the lane below. Neither rider nor horse were prepared for the deep drop; the latter on grounding bungled awkwardly on to his knees; but Laurence had him up in an instant, and left him blown and panting, when at the moment the grays came in sight. Lady Mitford was still in the carriage, but had apparently fainted, for she lay back motionless, while the reins were dragging in the road. Laurence thought there was yet a chance of stopping the ponies, upon whom the pace was evidently beginning to tell severely, but, as they neared a gate leading to a portion of the outbuildings, where on their first purchase by Mr. Saunderson they had been stabled, the grays, recollecting the landmarks, wheeled suddenly to the left and made for the gate. The carriage ran up an embankment and instantly overturned; one of the ponies fell, and commenced lashing out in all directions; the other, pulled across the pole, was plunging and struggling in wild attempts to free itself. The men who had been signalled to by Spurrier were by this time issuing from the lodge-gates, and making towards the spot; but long before they reached it, a tall man with a flowing black beard had sprung in among the débris, regardless of hoofs flying in all directions, and had dragged therefrom the senseless form of Lady Mitford. \"What is the matter? Where am I?\" \"You\u0027re at my farm, Lady Mitford,\" said Mr. Saunderson, advancing with that old-fashioned courtesy which he always assumed when dealing with ladies; \"and there\u0027s nothing the matter, thank God! though you\u0027ve had a bad accident with the ponies, which seem to have run away; and I may say you owe your life to Colonel Alsager, who rescued you at the peril of his own.\" She looked round with a faint smile at Laurence, who was standing at the foot of the sofa on which she lay, and was about to speak, when Laurence lifted his hand deprecatingly: \"Not a word, please, Lady Mitford; not a single word. What I did was simply nothing, and our friend Mr. Saunderson exaggerates horribly. Yes, one word--what of Sir Charles?\" \"He has not heard of it? He must not be told.\" \"No, of course not. What we want to know is whether he started for the drive with you.\" \"Oh no; he could not come,--he was prevented, thank God! And the groom?\" \"Oh, he\u0027s all right; a little shaken, that\u0027s all.\" Laurence did not say that the groom had been not a little shaken by Mr. Spurrier, who caught the wretched lad by the collar, and holding his whip over him told him mildly that he had a great mind to \"cut his life out\" for his cowardice in throwing himself out of the trap, and leaving his mistress to her fate. Then it was arranged that Mr. Saunderson should take Lady Mitford home, and explain all that had happened to Sir Charles. She took Laurence\u0027s arm to the carriage, and when she was seated, gave him her hand, saying frankly and earnestly, \"I shall never forget that, under Providence, I owe my life to you, Colonel Alsager.\" As they drove back to town together, Mr. Spurrier said to his companion \"I shall have to book Sir Launcelot to you, Colonel. I\u0027ve looked at his knees, and though they\u0027re all right, only the slightest skin-wound, still--\" \"Don\u0027t say another word, Spurrier,\" interrupted Laurence; \"I wouldn\u0027t let any one else have him, after to-day\u0027s work, for all the money in the world.\" Laurence spoke innocently enough; but he noticed that during the rest of the drive back to town Mr. Spurrier was eyeing him with great curiosity. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3078/85014.html","bookId":966,"book":{"id":966,"title":"Running the Gauntlet","description":"简介： Throughout the length and breadth of this London of ours there were few legal firms, no matter of how old standing, doing a better, larger ready-money business than that of Moss and Moss of Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane.
