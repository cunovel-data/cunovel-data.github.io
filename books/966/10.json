{"id":38725,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. SOUVENT FEMME VARIE.","content":"No; Laurence Alsager was certainly not best pleased at all he heard about Mrs. Hammond. Mrs. Hammond, a pretty little woman, coming to call upon you--great Heaven! Is that the way that that oaf Mitford talked of her who two years ago was Laura Molyneux, the mere mention of whose name caused Alsager to thrill to his finger-tips; and whose low trainante voice, long steady passionate glances, and rippling shoulders could have led him to destruction? Drove her chestnuts well, eh? Yes, by Jove! there were few women could touch her either in riding or driving, and--Laurence laughed grimly to himself as he strode along. What was it Dollamore had said about Mitford\u0027s readiness to go to the bad, to shake a loose leg, to enjoy those advantages of health, wealth, and position which had before been denied to him? Why, here was the very woman to ensnare him, to act as his evil genius, the very counter-charm of Lady Mitford\u0027s quietude and girlish grace; a woman of the world, bright, sharp, active, and alert; with plenty of savoir fair, an enormous talent for flirtation, and not the smallest scrap of heart to throw into the balance against any of her whims. No, by George, not a scrap. Laurence bethought him of a certain December morning in Kensington Gardens, and the whole scene rose vividly before him. The trees all stripped and bare, and stridently clanging in the bitter wind; the thick dun clouds hanging over the horizon; the greatcoated park-keeper stamping vigorously over the gravel, and banging himself with his arms with vague notions of generating calorie; and he himself pacing up and down by Laura Molyneux\u0027s side. The arguments he had used, the very phrases which he had employed to induce her to reconsider the determination then announced to him, were ringing in his ears. He recollected how he had humbled himself, how he had implored her to reconsider her decision, how even he had begged for time, and how he had been met with one stern pitiless refusal; and how he had gone away to weep bitter tears of mortified pride, and rejected love, and savage disappointment; and how she had stepped into the neat little brougham waiting for her at the gate, and been whirled off to accept the hand and heart of Mr. Percy Hammond, a retired civil-servant from India, a widower with one daughter, who had shaken the pagoda-tree to some purpose and returned to England with a colossal fortune. That was the then finale of the intimacy between Laura Molyneux and Laurence Alsager. In the course of the next week he started on his tour; in the course of the next month St. George\u0027s, Hanover Square, was the scene of her marriage,--a bishop welding the chains. And now two years had elapsed, and he was back in London, pretty much the same as if he had never left it; and she was asking whether he had returned, and he had begun to feel a great interest in Lady Mitford; and Sir Charles Mitford evidently thought Mrs. Hammond a most delightful person, and every thing was à tort et à travers, as it has been, is, and always shall be, in the great world of London. Nil admirari is the motto on which your precocious youth piques himself; but which is adopted in all due seriousness and sobriety by the calm student of life. Who wonders at anything?--at the peevishness of your wife; at the ingratitude of the child for whom you have pinched and slaved; at the treachery of the one familiar friend; at the enormous legacy left you by the uncle whose last words to you were that you were a jackanapes, and, so far as he was concerned, should be a beggar? The man of the world is surprised at nothing; he is not l\u0027homme blasé of the caricaturist; he is not an atom astonished at finding nothing in anything; on the contrary, he finds plenty of novelty in every variety of life; but nothing which may happen to him excites the smallest wonderment on his part. So that when Colonel Alsager walked into the Guards club to dinner, and received from the hall-porter a small note with an address in a handwriting perfectly familiar to him, he was not in the least surprised. But he looked at the note, and twisted it between his fingers, and even put it into his waistcoat pocket, as he walked up to the table whereon stood the framed menu, and left it there while he walked round and spoke to two or three men who were already at dinner; and it was not until he was comfortably seated at his little table, and had eaten a few mouthfuls of soup, that he took it from his pocket, leisurely opened it, and bringing the candle within range, began to read it. Even then he paused for a moment, recollecting with what heart-throbs of anxiety and sensations of acute delight he used to read the previous epistles from the same source; then, as with an effort, he set himself to its perusal. It was very short. \"I shall be at home to-morrow at three, and hope to see you. I hear all sorts of rumours, which you alone can solve. Chi non sa niente non dubita di niente! It will be for you to read the riddle. L.\" He smiled outright as, after reading it and restoring it to his pocket, he said to himself, \"The old story; she always made a mystery when there was no other excitement; but I\u0027ll go, for all that.\" During his wildest times, Laurence had always been a punctual man; and even the irregular manner of his life during the two last years had not altered him in this respect. On the next afternoon, as the clock was striking three, he presented himself at Mrs. Hammond\u0027s door, and was immediately admitted and shown into her presence. He was apparently a little too punctual; for a tall young woman, looking half lady, half nursery-governess, was standing by her and listening respectfully. Mrs. Hammond rose at the announcement of the Colonel\u0027s name, and coming forward, pressed his cold motionless hand with a tight grasp. \"Pray excuse me for one instant, Colonel Alsager,\" said she; \"the doctors have said that we were all wrong in leaving Florence; that it\u0027s impossible Mr. Hammond can remain in London during this awful weather, and that he must go at once to Torquay. So I\u0027m sending Miss Gillespie down there to get a house for us, and arrange matters before we go down.--Now, Ruth,\" turning to her, \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any more to say. Not facing the sea, recollect, and a six-stall stable and double coach-house. You know all about the rest,--bed-rooms, and those sort of things,--and so goodbye.\" Miss Gillespie touched lightly the outstretched tips of Mrs. Hammond\u0027s fingers, bowed gracefully to Laurence, and departed. Mrs. Hammond watched the door close again, and obviously ill at ease, turned to Laurence, and said: \"Miss Gillespie is the most invaluable person. She came at first as governess to Miss Hammond; but she has really made herself so useful to me, that I don\u0027t know what I should do without her. Housekeepers and all regular servants are so stupid; and I hate trouble so.\" She stopped, and there was a dead silence. Mrs. Hammond coloured, and said: \"Have you nothing to say, Colonel Alsager?\" \"On the subject of Miss Gillespie, nothing. If you sent for me to expatiate to me on Miss Gillespie\u0027s virtues, I am sorry; for my time could have been better employed.\" \"Than in coming to see me? You did not think so once.\" \"Then we didn\u0027t talk about Miss Gillespie. Your note said that you had heard rumours, or riddles, which you wanted me to explain. What have you heard?\" \"In a word, nothing. I wrote the first thing that came into my mind because I wanted to see you, Laurence Alsager. Because I have hungered to see you for two years; to hear your voice, to--You were at Vienna? at Ischl? and at Trieste?\" \"I was at all three--some little time at each.\" \"You saw the Times occasionally on your travels?\" \"While I remained in Europe, frequently. O yes, Laura, I received all your letters at the places you mention; and I saw the advertisement in the Times, under the signature and with the ciphers by which we used to correspond in the old days.\" \"And why did you take no notice?\" \"Because my love for you was gone and dead; because I was tired of being dragged about and shown-off, and made to display the abject state of docility to which you had reduced me. I told you all this that January morning in Kensington Gardens; I said to you, \u0027Let us finish this scheming and hiding; let our engagement be announced, and let us be married in the spring.\u0027 And you apparently assented; and went home and wrote me that letter which I have now, and shall keep to my dying day, declaring that you had been compelled to accept an offer from Mr. Hammond.\" \"You knew, Laurence, that my mother insisted on it.\" \"I knew you said so, Mrs. Hammond.--When I was acquainted with Mrs. Molyneux she was not much accustomed to having any influence with her daughter. Then I went away; but at first not out of the reach of that London jargon which permeates wherever Englishmen congregate. I heard of your marriage, of your first season, of the Richmond fête given for you by the Russian Prince, Tchernigow. I heard of you that autumn as being the reigning belle of Baden, where Tchernigow must have been at the same time, as I recollect reading in Galignani of his breaking the bank. Before I went to the East I heard of you in a score of other places; your name always connected with somebody else\u0027s name--always \u0027la belle Hammond, et puis--\u0027 I never choose to be one in a regiment; besides--\" \"Besides what?\" \"Well, my time for that sort of thing was past and gone; I was too old for it; I had gone through the phase of existence which Tchernigow and the others were then enjoying. I had offered you a steadfast honest love, and you had rejected it. When I heard of the Tchernigow alliance, and the various other passe-temps, I must say I felt enormously grateful for the unpleasantness you had spared me.\" \"I cannot say your tour has improved you, Colonel Alsager,\" said Mrs. Hammond calmly, though with a red spot burning on either cheek. \"In the old days you were considered the pink of chivalry, and would have had your tongue cut out before you would have hinted a sneer at a woman. You refuse to believe my story of compulsion in my marriage; but it is true--as true as is the fact that I rebelled then and there, and, having sold myself, determined to have as much enjoyment of life as was compatible with the sale.\" \"I never denied it, Mrs. Hammond; I simply told you what I had heard.\" \"Then tell me something more, Laurence Alsager,\" said Mrs. Hammond, flushing brilliantly, and looking him, for the first time during their interview, straight in the face; \"is it to be war between us two, or what?\" She looked splendidly beautiful just at that moment. She was a bright-looking little woman, with deep-gray eyes and long dark lashes, shining chestnut hair, a retroussé nose, a wanton mouth, and a perfect, trim, tight, rounded small figure. As she threw out this verbal challenge, her eyes flashed, she sat erect, and every fibre within her seemed quivering with emotion. Laurence marked her expression, and for an instant softened, as the recollection of the old days, when he had seen her thus wilfully petulant only to make more marked the subsidence into placidity and devotion, rose before him; but it faded rapidly away, had utterly vanished before, no less in reply to her peering gaze than to her words, he said, \"No, not war; neighbours who have been so nearly allied should never quarrel. Let us take another strategic phrase, and say that we will preserve an armed neutrality.\" \"And that means--?\" \"Well, in our case that means that neither shall interfere with the other\u0027s plans, of whatever kind, without due warning. That once given and disregarded, there will be war to the knife; for I think under present circumstances neither will be inclined to spare the other.\" \"Your anticipations are of a singularly sombre character, Colonel Alsager. I think that--ah!\" she exclaimed, suddenly clapping her hands, \"I see it all! my eyes are opened, and the whole map lies patent before me.\" \"What has caused this happy restoration of sight?\" \"Remembering a story which was told me a day or two ago by a little bird. The story of a preux chevalier and a lady in distress; of a romantic adventure and a terrific leap; of plunging hoofs and fainting-fits, and all the necessary ingredients of such a scene. Je vous en félicité, Monsieur le Colonel.\" Laurence\u0027s brow grew very dark as he said, \"You are too clever a woman to give a leg-up to a manifestly limping story, however much it might temporarily serve your purpose. Of that story as it stands, turned, twisted, perverted as it may be, nothing can be made. The scandal-mongers don\u0027t know what they have taken in hand. They might as well try to shake the Rock of Gibraltar as that lady\u0027s good name.\" Mrs. Hammond laughed a short bitter laugh and said, \"You have even lost that grand virtue which you possessed--the power of concealing your emotions. With the gravity, you have attained the simplicity of the Oriental; and you now--\" She was interrupted by the servant\u0027s throwing open the door and announcing, \"Sir Charles Mitford.\" That gentleman entered immediately on the announcement of his name, with a certain air of empressement which vanished so soon as he saw Colonel Alsager\u0027s broad back. Laura Hammond prided herself on never having been taken unawares. When speaking to Alsager her face had been curling with sneers, her voice harsh and strident; but before Sir Charles Mitford had crossed the threshold, she had wreathed her mouth in smiles, and as she shook hands with him, though aloud she only uttered the ordinary commonplaces, in a lower tone she said, \"I thought you would come to-day.\" Alsager heard her say it. That was a singular property of his--that gift of hearing anything that might be said, no matter in how large a party, or how earnestly he might be supposed to be talking. It had saved his life once; and he had assiduously cultivated it ever since. Mitford heard it too, but thickly. He had not had as much experience in the cadences of the demi-voix as Laurence. \"How are you, Alsager? We seem to be always tumbling over each other now, don\u0027t we? and the oftener the better, I say.--How d\u0027ye do, Mrs. Hammond? I say, what\u0027s all this that you\u0027ve been saying to my wife?\" Laurence started, and then reverted to the album which lay on his knees. Mrs. Hammond saw the start, and the means adopted for hiding it, and smiled quietly. \"I don\u0027t know what I said in particular to Lady Mitford; nothing to frighten her, I hope,\" said Mrs. Hammond; \"I was congratulating myself that she and I had got on so very well together.\" \"O yes, so you did, of course,\" said Sir Charles,--\"sisters, and all that kind of thing. But I mean what you said to her about leaving town.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s perfectly correct. Mr. Hammond has seen Sir Charles Dumfunk and Dr. Wadd, and they both concur in saying that he ought not to have left Florence until the spring; and that he must leave London forthwith.\" \"And they have recommended Torquay as the best place for him; at least so my wife tells me.\" \"Quite right; and in obedience to their commands I have sent Miss Gillespie off this very day to take a house, and make all necessary arrangements.\" \"Who\u0027s Miss Gillespie?\" \"My-well, I don\u0027t know what. I believe factotum is the Latin word for it. She\u0027s Miss Hammond\u0027s governess (my stepdaughter, you know), and my general adviser and manager. I don\u0027t know what I should do without her, as I told Colonel Alsager, who, by the way, did not pay much attention.\" Laurence grinned a polite grin, but said never a word. \"She was with me in the pony-carriage the first day Mr. Bertram introduced you to me, Sir Charles. Ah, but she had her veil down, I recollect; and she asked all about you afterwards.\" \"Very civil of her to take any interest in me,\" said Sir Charles. \"I recollect a veiled person in the pony-carriage; but not a bit of interest did I take in her. All that concentrated elsewhere, and that sort of thing;\" and he smiled at Mrs. Hammond in a manner that made Laurence\u0027s stern face grow sterner than ever. \"Well, but about Torquay,\" continued Sir Charles. \"I thought at first it was a tremendous nuisance your having to go out of town; but now I\u0027ve got an idea which does not seem so bad. Town\u0027s horribly slow, you know, utterly empty; one does not know what to do with oneself; and so I\u0027ve been suggesting to Georgie why not go down to Redmoor--our country place in Devon, you know--close to Torquay,--and one could fill the house with pleasant people, and you could come over from Torquay, and it would be very jolly indeed.\" He said it in an off-hand manner, but he nevertheless looked earnestly up into Mrs. Hammond\u0027s face, and Laurence Alsager\u0027s expression grew sterner than ever. Mrs. Hammond returned Sir Charles\u0027s glance, and said, \"That would be thoroughly delightful! I was looking forward with horror, I confess, to a sojourn at Torquay. Those dreadful people in respirators always creeping about, and the stupid dinner-parties, where the talk is always about the doctor, and the quarter in which the wind is. But with you and Lady Mitford in the neighbourhood it would be quite another thing.\" \"O yes, and we\u0027d get some jolly people down there.--Alsager, you\u0027d come?\" \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027d come, and I\u0027m anything but a jolly person. I must go to my father\u0027s at once.\" \"Gad, Alsager, you seem to keep your father always ready to bring forward whenever you want to be misanthropical. You were to have gone to him a week ago.\" \"Circumstances alter cases,\" said Mrs. Hammond with a short laugh; \"and Colonel Alsager finds London more tolerable than he expected. Is it not so, Colonel?\" \"\u0027Very tolerable, and not to be endured,\u0027 as Dogberry says, since I am about to leave it,\" said Laurence. (\"She would like to draw me into a semi-confidence on that subject; but she sha\u0027n\u0027t,\" thought he.) \"No; but really, Alsager, do try and come, there\u0027s a good fellow; you can hold over your father until you want an excuse for not going to some place where you\u0027ll be bored. Now we won\u0027t bore you; we\u0027ll take down a rattling good team Tom Charteris and his wife--she plays and sings, and all that kind of thing, capitally; and Mrs. Masters, who\u0027s quiet to ride or drive--I don\u0027t mean that exactly, but she\u0027s available in two ways,--as a widow she can chaperon, and she\u0027s quite young and pretty enough to flirt on her own hook; and the Tyrrells--nice girls those; and Bligh and Winton,--Oh, and Dollamore! I\u0027ll ask Dollamore; he\u0027d be just the man for such a party.\" \"O yes, you must have Lord Dollamore,\" said Mrs. Hammond; \"he has such a delightfully dry way of saying unpleasant things about everybody; and as he never shoots or hunts, he is a perfect treasure in a country house, and devotes himself to the ladies.\" She shot one hasty glance at Laurence as she said this, which he duly perceived. \"O yes,\" said Sir Charles, \"Dollamore\u0027s sure to come. And you, Alsager,--come, you\u0027ve changed your mind?\" \"Upon my word, the temptation you offer me is so great, that I\u0027m unable to resist it. Yes, I\u0027ll come.\" \"I thought you would,\" said Sir Charles carelessly. \"I knew you would,\" said Mrs. Hammond in an undertone; then aloud, \"What, going, Colonel Alsager? Goodbye; I\u0027m so pleased to have seen you; and looking so well too, after the climate, and all the things you\u0027ve gone through.\" Laurence shook hands with Mitford and departed. Yes, there was not much doubt about it: Sir Charles was tolerably well \"on\" in that quarter. An old poacher makes the best gamekeeper, because he knows the tricks and dodges of his old profession; and there was not one single move of Sir Charles Mitford\u0027s during the entire conversation which Laurence Alsager did not recognize as having been used by himself in bygone days. He knew the value of every look, knew the meaning of each inflexion of the voice; and appreciated to its full the motive-power which had induced the baronet suddenly to long for the country house at Redmoor, and to become disgusted with the dreariness of London. Determined to sit him out too, wasn\u0027t he? Lord! how often he, Laurence, had determinedly sat out bores for the sake of getting ten words, one hand-clasp, from Laura after they were gone! Yes, Mitford was getting on, certainly; making the running more quickly even than Dollamore had prophesied. Dollamore! ah, that reminded him: Dollamore was to be asked down to Redmoor. That, and the manner in which Mrs. Hammond had spoken of him and his visit, had decided Laurence in accepting Mitford\u0027s invitation. There could not be anything between them which--no; Dollamore could never have made a confidante of Laura and imparted to her--O no! Laura had not too much conscience in any case where her own passion or even her own whim was concerned; but she would shrink from meddling in an affair of that kind. And as for Lord Dollamore, he was essentially a man of petits soins, the exercise of which always laid those who practised them open to misunderstanding. He had a habit of hinting and insinuating also, which was unpleasant, but not very noxious. As people said, his bark was probably worse than his bite, and-- And at all events Laurence was very glad that he had accepted the invitation, and that he would be there to watch in person over anything that might happen. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3078/85018.html","bookId":966,"book":{"id":966,"title":"Running the Gauntlet","description":"简介： Throughout the length and breadth of this London of ours there were few legal firms, no matter of how old standing, doing a better, larger ready-money business than that of Moss and Moss of Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane.
