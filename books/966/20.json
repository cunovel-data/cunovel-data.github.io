{"id":38735,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. CHECKMATE.","content":"Mr. Effingham fulfilled his design of going into Torquay and dining well. In his singular costume he created quite a sensation among the invalids on the Parade, who would have severely resented the healthy and sporting tone of his ankle-jacks if it had not been mitigated by his slouch wideawake hat and black jacket. As it was, they merely regarded him as an eccentric person staying at one of the country-houses in the neighbourhood, and they pardoned his not being consumptive on the score of his being probably either rich or distinguished. So he \"did\" the town and all the lions to his great satisfaction, and, as affording them subject-matter for conversation over their valetudinarian dinners, to the satisfaction of those whom he encountered. He made an excellent dinner at the hotel, and then was driven out of his rural lodgings in a fly, having given orders for a dog-cart to be in readiness for him at the particular gate of Redmoor Park which he described at two o\u0027clock the next day. It was a brilliant starlight night, and Mr. Effingham had the head of the fly opened; he was well wrapped up, and the air being very mild, he wished to enjoy the beauties of nature and the flavour of his cigar simultaneously. As he lay back puffing the smoke out before him, his thoughts again reverted to his morning\u0027s work, and again he found every reason for self-gratulation. There would be the fifty pounds from Sir Charles--that was safe to start with; he should go up and give him notice in the morning, that that cheque might come up by the evening\u0027s post. That would help him to tide over any delay there might be in getting this woman to give up the bill. What a funny one she was! what a regular lively one! how she kept on laughing! and how sly she looked when she said that she was tired of that humdrum respectability, and would like to run away to the old adventurous life! Not one to be trifled with, though; none of your larks with her; regular stand-offish party. Well, never mind; that did not matter; what he was about now was business, and she seemed thoroughly up to that. He did not think he should have much trouble in making her see what advantage to them both could be got out of a proper use of the forged bill. One point, on which he at one time had had some doubt, the interview of that morning had satisfactorily set at rest. She had been spoony on Mitford--so Griffiths told him--and he feared that the old feeling might still remain, and she would refuse to take any steps about the bill lest she might injure her old flame. But, Lord! he could see plainly enough she did not care a snuff of a candle for Mitford now; rather more t\u0027other might be judged from the flash in her eyes and the sneer on her lips when she spoke of him. That was all right, so--Ah! perhaps her shrewd notions of business might lead her to seeing the value of the bill and to driving a hard bargain for it. He must be prepared for that; but when he got her up to London she would be much more in his power. The bill must be had somehow, by fair means or foul; and if she resisted--well, there would not be very much trouble in stealing or forcing it from her. As the reflections passed through his mind the carriage in which he sat reached the top of a height, whence was obtained a view of Redmoor House; its outline standing black and heavy against the sky, its lower windows blazing with light. The sight turned Mr. Effingham\u0027s thoughts into a slightly different current. \"O yes! go it; that\u0027s your sort,\" he said to himself with a certain amount of bitterness; \"fine games goin\u0027 on there, I\u0027ve no doubt; the best of drink, and coves with powdered heads to wait on you; game o\u0027 billiards afterwards, or some singin\u0027 and a dance with the women in the droring-room. That\u0027s the way to keep it up; go it while you\u0027re young. But, my friend the Bart., you\u0027d sing another toon and laugh the wrong side o\u0027 your mouth, and cut a very different kind o\u0027 caper, if you knew what was so close to you. I\u0027ve heard of a cove smokin\u0027 a pipe and not knowing that what he was sittin\u0027 on was a powder-barrel; and this seems to me very much the same sort o\u0027 thing. To think that close under his nose is the dockyment that would just crop his \u0027air, put him into a gray soot, Cole-Barth Fields, Milbank, and Portland, and that cussed stonequarryin\u0027 which, from all I\u0027ve heard, is the heart-breakin\u0027est work. To think that he\u0027s been payin\u0027 me to get the bill, and I\u0027ve been employin\u0027 Griffiths and givin\u0027 skivs to old Lyons and settin\u0027 half Doory Lane at work to hunt up the gal, and that there she was under his roof, the whole time--it\u0027s tremenjous!\" And Mr. Effingham laughed aloud, and lit a fresh cigar, and pulled the rug tighter over his legs. \"She\u0027s a rum \u0027un, she is. I wonder which of them lights is in her room. There\u0027s one a long way off the rest, up high all by itself; that\u0027s it, I shouldn\u0027t wonder. She\u0027s not fit company for the swells downstairs, I suppose. Well, perhaps not, if they knew everythin\u0027! But what a blessin\u0027 it is people don\u0027t know everythin\u0027! Perhaps if they did, some of \u0027em wouldn\u0027t be quite so fond of sittin\u0027 down with the Bart. I wonder what she\u0027s doin\u0027 just now. Packin\u0027 her traps ready for our start, I shouldn\u0027t wonder. What a game it will be! Yes, D\u0027Ossay, my boy, this is the best days work you ever did in your life; and your poor brother Tony little thought what a power of good he was doin\u0027 you when he first let you into the secret of Mr. Mitford and his little games.\" And with these reflections, and constantly-renewed cigars, Mr. Effingham beguiled the tedium of his journey to the Mitford Arms. He was up betimes the next morning, making his preparations for departure. His very small wardrobe--its very smallness regarded by the landlady of the inn as a proof of the eccentricity of literary genius--was packed in a brown-paper parcel. He discharged his modest bill, and began to fidget about until it was time to give his employer a final and fancy sketch of how he had accomplished his mission. Entirely fictional was this sketch intended to be, as widely diverging from fact as possible. Mr. Effingham knew well enough that so long as the removal of Miss Gillespie, or Lizzie Ponsford, had been effected, Sir Charles Mitford would care very little indeed about the means by which it had been accomplished. And as Mr. Effingham was playing a double game, it would be necessary for him to be particularly cautious in making any statement which might reveal the real state of the case to Sir Charles. These reflections, bringing clearly again before him the great fact of the entire business,--that he was being paid for communicating with a person, to communicate with whom he would have gladly paid a considerable sum of money had he possessed it,--put Mr. Effingham into the most satisfactory state of mind, and caused the time, which would otherwise have hung heavily on his hands, to pass pleasantly and quickly. He knew that there was little use in attempting to see Sir Charles before eleven o\u0027clock; so about that time he made his way up the avenue, on this occasion cutting short the old portress, who, contrary to the usual custom, was beginning to enter into some little story. It was Mr. Effingham\u0027s plan--and one which is pretty generally adopted in this world, especially by the lower order of Mr. Smiles\u0027s friends, the \"self-made\" men,--to kick down the ladder after he had landed from its top; and as Mr. Effingham thought he should be able to make no more use of this old woman, he did not choose to be bored by her conversation. So he cut her short with a nod, and walked up the avenue with a swaggering gait, which she had never known before, and which very much astonished her. He met no one on his way; and when he reached the house he went modestly round to a side-door leading to the billiard-room, through the window of which he observed no less a personage than Mr. Banks, Sir Charles\u0027s man, who was by himself, with his coat off and a cue in his hand trying a few hazards. Mr. Effingham gave a sharp tap at the glass, which made Mr. Banks start guiltily, drop his cue, and resume his garment; but when he looked up and saw who had caused him this fright, he waxed very wroth and said, \"Hallo! is it you? what do you want now?\" His tone did not at all suit Mr. Effingham, who replied sharply, \"Your master; go and tell him I\u0027m here.\" \"He ain\u0027t up yet,\" said Mr. Banks. \"Did you hear what I said? Go and tell him I\u0027m here.\" \"Did you hear what I said, that Sir Charles ain\u0027t stir-run\u0027?\" \"It\u0027ll be as much as your place is worth, my man, if you don\u0027t do what I tell you. Have I been here before, or \u0027ave I not? Have I been let in to him at once before, or \u0027ave I not? Does he see me d\u0027rectly you tell him who\u0027s waitin\u0027, or does he not? Now--go.\" This speech had such an effect upon Mr. Banks, who remembered that the little man only spoke the truth in his statement of the readiness with which Sir Charles always saw him, that he opened the door, showed Mr. Effingham into the billiard-room (which was decorated with empty tumblers, fragments of lemon-peel, tobacco-ash, and other remnants of the preceding night, and smelt powerfully of stale tobacco), suggested that he should \"knock the balls about a bit,\" and went up to tell his master. When he returned he said, \"He\u0027s just finished dressin\u0027, and I\u0027m to take you up in five minutes. You seem quite a favourite of his.\" Mr. Effingham laughed. \"Yes,\" he said; \"he and I understand one another.\" Mr. Banks looked at him for a moment, and then said, \"Was you ever in the Pacific?\" \"In the what?\" \"The Pacific.\" Mr. Effingham changed colour. He did not half like this. He thought it was the name of some prison, and that the valet had found him out. But he put a bold face on and said, \"What\u0027s the Pacific?\" \"Ocean,\" said Mr. Banks. \"No,\" said Mr. Effingham, \"certainly not--nothing of the sort.\" \"Not when you and he,\" pointing to the ceiling, \"was together?\" \"Certainty not.\" \"Ah!\" said Mr. Banks, \"kept at home, I suppose; it ain\u0027t so dangerous or such hard work at home, is it?--Portsmouth and round there?\" \"It\u0027s hard enough at Portsmouth, from what I\u0027ve heard,\" said Mr. Effingham; \"that diggin\u0027 away at Southsea\u0027s dreadful work.\" \"Diggin\u0027 aboard ship!\" said Banks in astonishment. \"How do you mean \u0027aboard ship\u0027?\" said the other. \"Why, I\u0027m talkin\u0027 of when you and him was on board the--what was it?--you know--Albatross.\" \"Oh!\" said Mr. Effingham, greatly relieved, and bursting into a fit of laughter; \"we went everywhere then. And that\u0027s where I learned something I don\u0027t mind teaching you.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Never to keep Sir Charles waiting. The five minutes is up.\" Mr. Banks looked half-annoyed, but his companion had already risen, so he made the best of it, pretended to laugh, and showed Mr. Effingham into Sir Charles Mitford\u0027s private snuggery. Sir Charles was drinking a cup of coffee. He looked eagerly at Mr. Effingham, and when Banks had closed the door, said: \"By the expression of your face I should say you bring good news. In two words--do you, or do you not?\" \"In two words--I do.\" Mitford set down his cup. Through his mind rushed one thought--the spy over his flirtation with Mrs. Hammond was removed! henceforward he could sit with her, talk to her, look at her, with the consciousness that his words would reach her ear alone, that his actions would not be overlooked. His face flushed with anticipated pleasure as he said: \"How was it managed? Did she make much resistance?\" \"Well, it wasn\u0027t a very easy job, and that\u0027s the fact. I\u0027ve seen many women as could be got over with much less trouble. You see the party seems to be in very comfortable quarters here,--all right to eat and drink, and not too much to do, and that sort of thing.\" \"Well, what then?\" \"Why, when parties are in that way they naturally don\u0027t like movin\u0027. Besides, there\u0027s another strong reason I\u0027ve found out why that young woman don\u0027t want to go.\" \"And that is--\" \"She\u0027s uncommon fond, of you. Ah, you may shake your head, but I\u0027m sure of it.\" \"If she made you believe that, Mr. Effingham,\" said Sir Charles with a very grim smile, \"I\u0027m afraid she\u0027s got the better of you altogether.\" \"Has she, by Jove! No, no. The proof of the puddin\u0027s in the eatin\u0027, Sir Charles; and whether I\u0027ve done the trick or not you\u0027ll find out before I\u0027ve finished. Any how, I\u0027m satisfied.\" \"Well, as you say that, and as the payment of the fifty pounds depends upon the \u0027trick being done,\u0027 as you call it, I suppose before you\u0027ve finished your story I shall be satisfied too.\" \"What was I saying? Oh, about her being nuts on you still,--O yes,--and I had to talk to her about that, and tell her it wouldn\u0027t do now you was married, and, in fact, that that was one of the great reasons for her to go, as parties had observed her feelin\u0027s. That seemed to touch her,--for her pride\u0027s awful,--and she began to give way, and at last, after a long palaver, she said she\u0027d go, though not before I--\" \"Beg your pardon, Sir Charles,\" said Banks, opening the door; \"Mrs. Hammond, Sir Charles, wishes to speak to you, Sir Charles: she\u0027s here at the door.\" \"Show her in, by all means,\" said Mitford, turning to Effingham and laying his finger on his lips; then to him, sotto voce, \"Keep your mouth shut!\" \"I\u0027m very sorry to trouble you, Sir Charles,\" said Mrs. Hammond, entering hurriedly, with a slight bow to the stranger and a glance of astonishment at his appearance; \"but I will detain you only an instant. Have you heard anything of Miss Gillespie?\" \"Of Miss Gillespie? I, Mrs. Hammond? Not a word. What has happened?\" \"Of course you haven\u0027t, but the most extraordinary thing! This morning Miss Gillespie did not come into Alice\u0027s room as usual; so the child dressed by herself, and went to Miss Gillespie\u0027s room. She tried the door, and found it fast; so, concluding that her governess was ill,--she\u0027s subject to headaches, I believe,--Alice went down to breakfast. Afterwards she tried Miss Gillespie\u0027s door again, but with no better success; and then she came to me. I sent for Gifford, Mr. Hammond\u0027s man, you know; and after calling out once or twice, he burst the door open; we all rushed in, and found the room empty.\" \"Empty!\" cried Sir Charles. \"The devil!\" burst out Mr. Effingham. \"I beg your pardon! What an odd thing!\" \"Empty,\" repeated Mrs. Hammond. \"The bed hadn\u0027t been slept in; her boxes were open, and some of the things had been taken out; while on the dressing-table was this note addressed to me.\" She handed a small slip of paper to Sir Charles, who opened it and read aloud: \"You will never see me again. Search for me will be useless. \"R. G.\" \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Hammond, \"she\u0027s gone. \u0027Search for me will be useless.\u0027 So provoking too; just the sort of person one liked to have about one; and I had got quite accustomed to her and all that. \u0027Never see me again;\u0027 I declare it\u0027s horribly annoying. Now, Sir Charles, I want to ask your advice: what would you do? Would you have people sent after her in all directions, eh?\" \"Well, \u0027pon my word, I don\u0027t see how you can do that,\" said Sir Charles. \"She hasn\u0027t taken anything of yours, I suppose,--no, of course not,--so, you see, she has a right to go away when she likes. Needn\u0027t give a month\u0027s warning, eh?\" \"Right to go away! Well, I don\u0027t know,--I suppose she has--and I suppose I haven\u0027t any right to stop her; but it is annoying; and yet it\u0027s highly ridiculous, isn\u0027t it?\" \"What on earth can have driven her away? Nobody rude to her, I should think; she wasn\u0027t that sort of person. Well, I won\u0027t bore you any more now about it, particularly as you\u0027re busy. We shall meet at luncheon, and then we can talk further over this unpleasant affair.\" And with a smile to Sir Charles, and another slight bow to Mr. Effingham, she left the room. \"Well, you certainly have done your work excellently, Mr. Effingham,\" said Sir Charles, as soon as the door had closed; \"in the most masterly manner!\" \"Yes, it ain\u0027t bad, I think,\" said Mr. Effingham, with a ghastly attempt at a grin; \"I told you it was all square.\" \"Yes; but I had no notion it would come about so quickly.\" \"Why, I hadn\u0027t half time to tell you about it. However, there it is, done, cut, and dried,--all finished except the payment; and I\u0027m ready for that whenever you like.\" \"Our agreement was, that the cheque was to be sent to London, to an address which you gave me--\" \"Yes, but as I\u0027m here, I may as well take it myself. You haven\u0027t got it in notes or gold, have you? It would be handier.\" \"No, not sufficient; but they would change my cheque at the bank in Torquay, I\u0027ve no doubt.\" \"No, thank you, never mind, it ain\u0027t worth the trouble. I shall have to go to town, I suppose, and I shan\u0027t want it till I get there--that is, if you can lend me a couple of sovereigns just to help me on my way. Thank you; much obliged. Now, you\u0027ve got my address, and you know where to find me when you want me; and you may depend on not seein\u0027 me for a very long time. Good morning to you.\" He took the cheque and the sovereigns and put them in his waistcoat-pocket, made a clumsy bow, and was gone. Then Sir Charles Mitford rose from his chair and walked to the window, radiant with delight. It was all clear before him now; the incubus was removed, and he was free to carry out his projects. Mr. Effingham strode down the avenue, switching his stick and muttering: \"Done! sold! swindled!\" he exclaimed; \"regularly roped,--that\u0027s what I am! It was lucky I kept my face before the Bart., or I should never have collared the cheque; but that\u0027s all right. So far he thinks it was my doin\u0027, and forked out accordin\u0027. That\u0027s the only bright part of it. To think that a yellow-faced meek-lookin\u0027 thing like that should have taken me in to that toon! What can her game be? To get clear of the lot of us?--that\u0027s it! Pretendin\u0027 to be all square with me, and then cuttin\u0027 and runnin\u0027 and shakin\u0027 it all off! Oh, a deep \u0027un, a regular deep \u0027un! Now what\u0027s my game? After her as hard as I can. Where will she make for? London, I should think,--try hidin\u0027 somewhere. Ah! if she does that, I\u0027ll ferret her out. It\u0027ll be a quiet place that I don\u0027t hunt her up in, with the means I have for workin\u0027 a search. Here\u0027s two skivs to the good from the Bart. I\u0027ll meet the dog-cart and get down to Torquay, and go up at once by the express. Hallo! gate, there!\" \"Why, you are in a hurry, sir!\" said the old portress, coming out; \"mist as pressed as the young woman as knocked me up at day-dawn this morning.\" \"Ah! what was that?\" said Mr. Effingham stopping short. \"I would have told you this morning when you came in; but you were so short and snappish!\" said the old lady. \"She came down wi\u0027 a little passel in her hand, and knocked at my door and ast for the key. And I got up to let her out, and there were a fly outside--Mullins\u0027s fly, and young Mullins to drive; and she got in, and off they went.\" \"Ay, ay where does Mullins live?\" \"Just close by Mitford Arms. His father were wi\u0027 my father--\" \"Yes, yes; thank you! all right! goodbye!\" and Mr. Effingham rushed off up the by-lane to where he knew the dog-cart was waiting. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3078/85028.html","bookId":966,"book":{"id":966,"title":"Running the Gauntlet","description":"简介： Throughout the length and breadth of this London of ours there were few legal firms, no matter of how old standing, doing a better, larger ready-money business than that of Moss and Moss of Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane.
