{"id":38733,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. IN THE DRAWING-ROOM.","content":"What was Laurence Alsager doing at Redmoor? He was beginning to ask himself that question very frequently. And that question led to another--why had he come down there at all? He had \"done\" country-houses and their amusements and had tired of them years before; he had not the slightest liking for any of the guests; he had a vague dislike of the host. Why, then, had he come? He was a man who rarely tried to deceive himself; and when he put this question point-blank to himself the answer was, Why? Why, because you take a certain interest in Lady Mitford--no, I allow that perfectly; nothing dishonourable, nothing which at present could even be described as a love-passion; but a certain interest. You think from all you have seen that she is not merely very charming in her innocence and simplicity, but really good; and you expect from certain signs which you detect, and with the nature of which you are familiar, that she will have to pass through a very perilous ordeal. It is obvious to you that in society, as it is now constituted, a woman of Lady Mitford\u0027s personal attractions and position must incur a very great deal of temptation. This, of course, would be to a great extent avoided if she were secure in the affections and certain of the attentions of her husband; but in the present instance you are constrained to admit, contrary to the opinion which you once publicly expressed, that Sir Charles Mitford is a weak, silly, vain person, who has fallen a victim to the wiles of a thoroughly heartless coquette, and who appears to be going from bad to worse as rapidly as possible. So that your certain interest has brought you down here to watch over the lady. Quixotic and ultra-romantic, is it not? You do not mean it to be so, I know--I give you full credit for that; but still that is the designation it would probably receive from any of your friends. The truth is, that this--I was almost going to call it parental, but we will say fraternal--this fraternal regard for a very handsome woman is a novelty to you; and hence your enjoyment of it. I said expressly a very handsome woman, because I don\u0027t believe that the fraternal sentiment could possibly blossom for an ugly one. Beware of it, my friend, if you please! it\u0027s the trickiest, most treacherous elf, this fraternal friendship, that exists; it goes on for a certain period perfectly steadily and properly, and then one morning you find it has deserted you, and left in its place a hot flaming riotous passion that scorches you into tinder, makes you miserable, takes away your appetite, and, in fact, possesses all the qualities which, at one time, you knew so well. Such was the result of Laurence Alsager\u0027s self-examination, and he fully admitted its truth. It was the interest which he took in Lady Mitford that had induced him to visit Redmoor; it was the same feeling which kept him lingering there. Then the interest must have increased; for the necessity for his self-imposed task of protection and supervision had certainly diminished. The actual fact which had decided his coming was the announcement that Lord Dollamore was to be among the guests. He had always had his own opinion of Lord Dollamore\u0027s morality; and the way in which that nobleman had spoken of Lady Mitford in the smoking-room of the Maecenas had jarred horribly on Alsager\u0027s nerves. There was something too in Laura Hammond\u0027s look and in the tone of her voice when she spoke of the probability of Dollamore\u0027s being left constantly with the ladies, at which Laurence had taken alarm. But Lord Dollamore seemed to be perfectly innocuous. Laurence had watched him narrowly from the first, and, as in the case of the drive to Egremont Priory, he seemed rather to avoid than to seek opportunities of being in Lady Mitford\u0027s company en tête-à-tête, and, judging from that and one or two other instances, was apparently desirous of keeping in the background, and of pushing Laurence forward. Could he--? No; he was a man utterly without principle where women are concerned; but he would never attempt such a game as that, more particularly if he, Laurence Alsager, were involved in it. Certainly Sir Charles was going to the bad more rapidly than Alsager had anticipated; but then it was to be said for him that he clearly had fallen into able hands. There had been few such adepts in the art of flirtation in Europe as Laura Molyneux; and she seemed to have become even more fertile in resources and skilful in their development since her marriage. Anything like the manner in which she had flirted with Mitford during the first few clays of her visit to Redmoor, Laurence, in all his experience, had never seen; and he thought at the time of the Egremont Priory expedition that things were coming rapidly to an end. Lady Mitford had evidently noticed something that day, some tendresse between her husband and Mrs. Hammond, which had annoyed her very much; so much that she had almost called her friends\u0027 attention to her disgust. But the sweetness of her disposition had come to the rescue. Laurence knew, as well as if he had been able to read her thoughts, all that had passed in her mind during that drive in the pony-phaeton; he saw how she had reasoned with herself, and how she had finally determined that she had been hasty, inconsiderate, and in the wrong. He had seen her, immediately on alighting, slip away to join her husband; and he could fully understand that she had made silent atonement for what she imagined to be an outburst of groundless jealousy. An extraordinary change had come over Mitford within the last few days. Before the picnic, and at the picnic, he had been enthralled, entêté, eagerly waiting for Mrs. Hammond\u0027s every look, every word, and scarcely able to behave with decency to anybody else. Since then he had acted quite differently. Had his conscience smitten him for neglecting his wife? No; Laurence did not believe in sudden conscience-smites with such men as Sir Charles Mitford; and he had further noticed that though there was no open flirtation, there was plenty of eye-telegraphy of a very peculiar and significant kind. They had come to some understanding evidently, for Mrs. Hammond now seldom addressed her conversation to her host, but kept her hand in by practising on the susceptible heart of Major Winton, or by coquetting with some of the officers who were invariably to be found dining at Redmoor. She had tried to réchauffer a little of the old story with Laurence, but had encountered something so much more marked than mere disinclination, that she suspended operations at once. However, be this as it might, the necessity for Alsager\u0027s stay at Redmoor, even judged by his own peculiar notions, was at an end. The Dollamore question never had been mooted; the Hammond difficulty seemed entirely in abeyance. What further need was there for him to keep watch and ward over the Redmoor household? He could be back in town as soon as they could, go where they might; something would occur during the season, he thought, and he might as well be there on guard; but that was a matter of only a few hours from wherever he might happen to be. Whither should he go, then? Not back to London--that was impossible. The week or two he had passed there had thoroughly sickened him of London for some time to come. Paris? No, he thought not! The bals d\u0027opéra would be on then,--Frisotte and Rigolette, Celestine and Mogador, Brididi and the Reine Pomaré--O yes, he knew it all; it was a very long time since those exercitations of the cancan, rebuked by the sergents-de-ville in a low grumble of \"Pas si fort! pas si fort! point du télégraphe!\" had afforded him the slightest pleasure. Leicestershire? No, though he had purchased Sir Launcelot, and from merely that short experience of him at Acton, felt sure that he would \"show them the way\"--no, not Leicestershire this year, he thought, nor anywhere else, unless he went down to Knockholt to see his father. Yes, by Jove! he ought to have done that long since, and now he would do it at once. He settled this in his own mind as he was dressing for dinner about a week after the winter picnic. Settled it not without long deliberation and a little sleep, for he began to give the matter his careful consideration after returning from a long day\u0027s shooting; and it was not until he had steamed and lathered himself in a warm bath, had pulled the little sofa in front of the fire, and was contemplating his evening clothes neatly arranged on an adjacent chair, that he began to consider the question. His deliberation involved the putting up of his feet on the sofa, and that proceeding caused him at once to drop helplessly off to sleep, only to be roused by the loud clanging of the second dinner-bell. An addition accrued to the dinner-party that day, in the persons of Sir Thomas Hayter, a country neighbour, his wife and daughter. Sir Thomas was a hearty old Tory country squire, who during his one season in London had been captivated by and had married her ladyship; at the time of her marriage a passée beauty, now a thin chip of an old woman, still affecting girlish airs. Miss Hayter was a fine, fresh, dashing, exuberant girl, inclined to flirting, and fulfilling her inclination thoroughly. They infused a little new life into the party; for though Sir Thomas did not talk a great deal, he listened to everything that was said, and threw in an occasional \"Ha! dear me!\" with great vigour and effect, while Lady Hayter chirped away to Sir Charles Mitford, asking him about all sorts of London people of whom he had never heard, and quite bewildering him with her volubility. She succeeded better with Mr. Hammond, whose health was fast improving in the soft Devon air, and who, in spite of the strongly-expressed opinion of his wife, had come down to dinner that day. He was seated next to Lady Hayter; and shortly after dinner commenced, he found out that he had known her before her marriage, when she was Miss Fitzgibbon; \"used to have the pleasure of meeting you at the Silvesters\u0027 in South Audley Street;\" and then they entered upon a very long conversation about the acquaintances of their youth, while all the time each was stealing covert glances at the other, and wondering how it was possible--she, that that cadaverous, parchment-faced, bent invalid could be the handsome boy who in those days had just come up from Haileybury, and was going to India with such good prospects; he, that the old woman with the palpably-dyed purple hair, the scraggy neck, and the resplendent teeth--the gold springs of which were so very visible--could have been Emily Fitzgibbon, about whose beauty every one was raving in \u002725. Miss Hayter too was very happy; she was immensely taken by Laurence Alsager, next to whom she was seated. She had heard of him often; and two years before, when she was in London, he had been pointed out to her at the Opera; and she, then a young lady of seventeen, had gone home and written about him in her diary, and drawn portraits of him in her blotting-book, and thought him the handsomest creature in the world. She told him this, not of course in so many words, but with that charming quiet way of paying a compliment which some well-bred women possess; and she had also heard of the catastrophe with the ponies at Acton, and of his gallant conduct. \"For it was very gallant, you know, Colonel Alsager; any one could see that, even through that ridiculous newspaper report; and it was a splendid jump too. I was talking about it the other day to my cousin Fred Rivers, who knows you, I think; and he said he\u0027d seen the place, and Mr. ----, I forget his name; the head man up there--said it was as fine a thing as ever was done in Leicestershire; and Fred said he thought so too; \u0027bar none,\u0027 he said, in that sporting way, don\u0027t you know, which he has of talking.\" \"You make a great deal too much of it, Miss Hayter,\" said Laurence, smiling; \"I\u0027ve seen Fred Rivers take many such jumps himself, for a better horseman never crossed country.\" \"Ah, yes, during a run, I daresay; but this was in cold blood, wasn\u0027t it?--not that I wonder at your doing anything for Lady Mitford. Isn\u0027t she lovely? I declare I never saw such a perfect face in my life.\" Alsager was about to answer, when Major Maxse spoke from the other side of the table, \"Oh, by the way, Colonel Alsager, what Miss Hayter was saying reminds me that you ought not to have driven that day we went to Egremont; you should have gone on horseback. There\u0027s a very neat country if you do but know it.\" \"Did you drive over, Colonel Alsager?\" asked Miss Hayter in astonishment. \"Yes; I drove Lady Mitford in her pony-phaeton.\" (\"Oh!\" in a subdued tone from Miss Hayter.) \"Sir Charles was the only one who rode.\" \"And Mrs. Hammond,--I beg your pardon, and Mrs. Hammond!\" said Major Winton, the first words he had spoken since he sat down to dinner. \"I too was on horseback, but I can scarcely be said to have ridden. But, coming back, they went away splendidly. I never saw anything better than the manner in which the first fence was cleared by them both. I daresay it was as good all over the course; but they got away after the first, and we never saw any more of them.\" And Major Winton sipped his first glass of post-prandial claret with great gusto. He had paid off Mrs. Hammond for using him on the picnic-day, and throwing him off when she no longer required him. It was to be presumed, however, that Mrs. Hammond had not heard this remark; at least she gave no signs of having done so, being occupied in conversation with Captain Bligh. Sir Charles Mitford grew very red; Miss Hayter looked round, enjoying the fun; and an awkward pause ensued, broken by old Sir Thomas Hayter. \"Didn\u0027t I hear you say you were over at Egremont the other day, Mitford?\" \"Yes, Sir Thomas; we went over there, and had a kind of winter picnic.\" \"You didn\u0027t see anything of Torn Boscastle, I suppose?\" \"No; we only went to the ruins, and lunched in the keep. Besides, I don\u0027t know him.\" \"Ah! you wouldn\u0027t have seen him if you had known him. He keeps quite to himself just now.\" \"What\u0027s the matter? is he ill?\" \"No, not ill in body, you know. What\u0027s that we used to learn in the Latin grammar--\u0027magis quam corpore, aegrotat\u0027--his mind, you know.\" \"That\u0027s bad; what has brought that about?\" \"Well, you see, he\u0027s got a son, a wild extravagant fellow, who has run through I can\u0027t tell how much money, which poor Tom could very ill afford, as we all know; and the last thing the vagabond did was to get hold of his father\u0027s cheque-book, and forge his name to a terrible amount.\" Had Sir Thomas been a gentleman of quick perception--a charge which had never been brought against him--he would have been very much astonished at the effect of his anecdote. Sir Charles Mitford turned deadly white. Colonel Alsager frowned heavily, and glanced towards Lady Mitford, who, pale as her husband, looked as if she were about to faint; Lord Dollamore glanced sharply at Sir Thomas Hayter, to see whether he had spoken innocently or with malice prepense. Mrs. Hammond was the only one who seemed to keep her wits thoroughly about her. She glanced at Lady Mitford, and then pushing her chair back sharply, as though obeying a signal from her hostess, rose from the table, followed of course by all the other ladies. After their departure, and so soon as the door closed behind them, Lord Dollamore addressed himself to Sir Thomas, asking him if he had heard the report that the Whig Ministry intended to impose a new duty on cider--a subject which he knew would engross the old gentleman\u0027s attention, to the exclusion of Tom Boscastle and every one else. And, as Lord Dollamore said afterwards, it was an illimitable subject, for he himself invented the report as a herring across the scent; but under old Hayter\u0027s fostering care it grew into a perfect Frankensteinian monster. While they were talking, Sir Charles Mitford filled a bumper of claret, and after swallowing half of it, looked round the table to see the extent of the calamity. Then, for the first time, he acknowledged to himself how right the girl Lizzie Ponsford had been in what she had said. Dollamore evidently knew the story, and Alsager--perhaps Hammond, who was leaning back in his chair, enjoying his Madeira; but he could tell in an instant, by the expression of their faces, that none of the others had heard it. Another link had been forged this evening in the chain of his attachment to that charming Mrs. Hammond! how nobly she had behaved! Poor Georgie had lost her bead of course, and had very nearly made a mess of it by fainting, or screaming, or something; but that other woman did just exactly the right thing at the right time. And all for him! He was more infatuated with her than ever. He wondered whether he should ever have the chance of telling her so. He wondered how Butler was progressing in his mission. By the time the gentlemen arrived in the drawing-room, all trace of the little awkwardness at the dessert-table had passed away. Indeed, Miss Hayter was the only one of all the ladies who had noticed Georgic\u0027s uneasiness, and she had not attributed it to its right cause. Now Lady Mitford was looking as serenely lovely as ever, listening to Mrs. Charteris warbling away at the piano; and she looked at her husband with such loving solicitude as he entered the room, that he could not refrain from going up to her, smiling kindly, and pressing her hand, as he whispered, \"All right! quite blown over.\" Then Sir Charles went in search of Mrs. Hammond. She was sitting in a low chair near the fire, with a little table bearing a shaded lamp close by her hand, and was amusing herself by turning over an album of prints. She never gave herself the smallest trouble when left alone with women; she did not care what they thought of her, and, save under peculiar circumstances, she made no effort to please them. She wished to stand well with Lady Mitford, but she considered she had done enough to that end for one day by executing the masterly retreat from the dinner-table. So she sat there idly under the shade of the lamp, and Sir Charles Mitford thought he had never seen her to such advantage. Her rounded figure showed to perfection in her violet-velvet dress trimmed with soft white lace; her head reclined lazily on the back of her chair, and her eyes rested with calm indifference on the pages of the album--indifference which was succeeded by bright vivacity as she raised them and marked her host\u0027s approach. He dropped quietly into a chair close by hers and said, \"You have increased my debt of gratitude to you a thousand-fold.\" \"Have I?\" she replied; \"it has been very easily increased. So easily that I don\u0027t know how it has been done.\" \"Don\u0027t you? Then your natural talent is wonderful. I should think there were few better or more useful stratagems in warfare than the diversion of the enemy\u0027s attention from your weak point.\" \"Oh,\" she said, \"that is not worth remembering; certainly not worth mentioning again. I am so glad,\" she added, dropping her voice, \"to see you by my side again. I have gone through all kinds of self-examination, imagining that I had in some way offended you; going over in my own mind all that I had said or done since that delicious ride home from Egremont, and I could not tax myself with having wittingly given you any cause for offence. But you seemed to avoid me, to shrink from me, and I cannot tell you how I felt it.\" Voice very low here, looks downcast, and general depression. \"Don\u0027t speak in that way,\" said Sir Charles in the same tone; \"you don\u0027t understand my position. I could explain, and I will some time or other when I have the chance; not now, because--Yes, you are quite right, Mrs. Hammond, Sir Thomas is a thorough specimen of the good old English--\" \"Very sorry to interrupt so pleasant a talk, specially when on so charming a subject as Sir Thomas Hayter,\" said Lord Dollamore, approaching; \"but I come as a deputation from the general company to beg that Mrs. Hammond will sing to us.\" \"Mrs. Hammond would be charmed,\" said that lady; \"but to-night she is out of voice, and really cannot.\" \"Do, Mrs. Hammond; as a matter of mere charity, do,\" said Lord Dollamore. \"That delightful person Mrs. Charteris,--most delightful, and kind, and all that,--has been trilling away every evening until one is absolutely sick of her thin little voice. Do, for pity\u0027s sake, change the note, and let us have a little of your contralto. Do.\" \"You\u0027re very polite, Lord Dollamore; and \u0027as a matter of mere charity\u0027 I should be delighted to help you, but really I am out of voice and cannot. Stay; the old rule in convivial societies was, or I am mistaken, that one should sing or find a substitute. Now I think I can do the latter. Miss Hammond\u0027s companion, governess, what you will,--Miss Gillespie,--sings charmingly. If Lady Mitford will permit me, I will send for her.\" Georgie, appealed to, was only too well pleased to secure such an aid to the evening\u0027s entertainment; so a message was sent to Miss Gillespie, and she was requested to \"bring some songs;\" Miss Hayter filling up the interval by playing, sufficiently brilliantly, a pot-pourri of dance-music. Towards the end of this performance the door opened and Miss Gillespie entered. All eyes were instantly turned towards her, and--in the case of all the men at least--the casual glance grew into a lengthened gaze. She was a very striking-looking woman, with her sallow cheeks, her large eyes, her brown hair rolling in crisp waves on her forehead. She was dressed in a tight-fitting brown-silk dress with handsomely-worked collar and sleeves, and in her hand she carried a roll of music, of which Lord Dollamore stepped forward to relieve her; but she thanked him with a slight bow and sat down on the chair close to the door, still retaining her roll of music in her hand. When Miss Hayter had ceased playing, Lady Mitford crossed the room and shook hands with Miss Gillespie, offered her refreshment, thanked her very sweetly for the promptitude with which she had acceded to their request, and told her that Mrs. Hammond had already raised their expectation very high. Then Sir Charles Mitford came up somewhat stiffly, and offered his arm to Miss Gillespie and led her to the piano; and there, just removing her gloves, and without the smallest hesitation or affectation, she sat down, and with scarcely any prelude plunged at once into that most delightful of melodies, \"Che faró senza Eurydice,\" from Glück\u0027s Ofeo. Ah, what a voice! clear, bell-like, thrilling, touching not merely the tympanum of the ear, but acting on the nerves and on the spinal vertebrae. What melody in it! what wondrous power! and as she poured out the refrain, \"Eurydice, Eurydice!\" what deep passionate tenderness! The company sat spell-bound; Lord Dollamore, an accomplished musician himself, and one who had heard the best music everywhere, sat nursing his knee and drinking-in every note. Laurence Alsager, rapt in admiration, had even been guilty of the discourtesy of turning his back on Miss Hayter, whose chatter began to annoy him, and was beating time with his head and hand. Tom Charteris had crept behind his wife, who, far too good a little woman to feel professional jealousy, was completely delighted; and the big tears were rolling down Lady Mitford\u0027s face. She was still a child, you see, and had not gone through the Clanronald furnace, where all tears are dried up for ever. When the song was ended, there came a volley of applause such as is seldom heard in drawing-rooms, and far different from the usual languid \"Thank you,\" which crowns the failure of the amateur. Miss Gillespie looked round elated, as though the sound was pleasant and not unfamiliar to her, and was about to rise from her seat, when Laurence Alsager, who was nearest the piano, advanced, and begged she would remain--he was sure he spoke in the name of all present. So Miss Gillespie, after looking him hard in the face, made him a little bow, and remained at the piano, this time starting off into one of Louis Puget\u0027s charming French ballads, \"Ta main,\" which she sung with as much fire and chic as if she had never quitted Paris. At the conclusion of the second song, Lady Mitford came across to the piano to thank the singer, and she was followed by Mrs. Charteris and Mrs. Masters. Mrs. Charteris was in the highest delight--a feeling; not at all decreased when Miss Gillespie assured her that she had frequently listened to her, Mrs. Charteris\u0027s, singing, and had often envied that lady her correct musical education. Mrs. Masters said her little complimentary say about the song, but was principally taken up by Miss Gillespie\u0027s costume. She was one of those women who never see anything new worn by any other woman without taking private mental notes of its every detail; thus setting at defiance any attempted extension of the Patent laws in regard to female apparel. So, with her eyes devouring Miss Gillespie\u0027s dress, Mrs. Masters said to her \"Yes, so charming that Glück! so full of depth and power!--(Wonderfully good silk; stands by itself like a board!)--And the little French chansonnette, so sparkling and melodious, and--(O yes, certainly French I should think! no English house could--) may I ask you where you got that collar and those cuffs, Miss--Miss Asplin? They are most peculiar!\" \"My name is Gillespie, madam; and the collar and cuffs I worked myself.\" After which Mrs. Masters bowed, and went back to her seat. During this examination Laurence Alsager, who had seated himself next to Miss Hayter, in the neighbourhood of the piano, was conscious that Miss Gillespie\u0027s looks constantly strayed towards him. It is very odd. There was nothing coquettish in the regard, he knew every one in that category of glances of old; but these were strangely earnest looks, always averted when she found they were remarked. While they were full upon him, Miss Hayter, in reply to something he had said about his delight in ferns, expressed a hope that they would see him at her father\u0027s place, the Arme Wood, where there was a splendid fernery. Laurence, in reply, thanked her, and said how happy he would have been to go, but that he feared it would be impossible, as he intended to leave Redmoor in a day or two. He must be a dutiful son, and visit his father, whom he had not seen since his return to England. As he said this Miss Gillespie\u0027s eyes were full on him. They were very singular eyes, he thought, as he undressed himself lazily before the fire in his bed-room. Very singular eyes; so large, and dark, and speaking. What on earth made the woman look at him so perpetually! He was growing too old to inspire love at first sight, he felt, smiling grimly as he inspected himself in the looking-glass; besides, she was not the style of woman for any such folly. How magnificently she sung! what depth and pathos there was in her voice! \"Eurydice, Eurydice!\"--those notes were enough to go through any man\u0027s soul; those notes were enough to--hallo, what\u0027s this? He had strolled across to the dressing-table, and taken up a small sealed Dote, addressed in a thin fine female hand to Colonel Alsager. He broke the seal and read: \"I heard you talk of leaving Redmoor. If not impossible I pray you to stay. Your presence will be a check upon two people, who, liberated from that, will go headlong to ruin, dragging down a third in their fall. For the welfare of this third person both you and I are solicitous. But it seems probable that my sphere of usefulness is ended; so all devolves upon you. Remember this, and for her sake, stay on.\" \"Ah!\" said Laurence Alsager when he had perused this mysterious note for the second time--\"there\u0027s no doubt that my anonymous correspondent is the handsome woman with the eyes and voice. What she means I\u0027ll find out in the morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3078/85026.html","bookId":966,"book":{"id":966,"title":"Running the Gauntlet","description":"简介： Throughout the length and breadth of this London of ours there were few legal firms, no matter of how old standing, doing a better, larger ready-money business than that of Moss and Moss of Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane.
