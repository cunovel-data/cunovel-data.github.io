{"id":97350,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Aliisza, disguised as a lovely drow female, perched on the roof of a quaint shop that stood along the side of a street leading to the plaza, and she watched the comings and goings of the citizens, slaves, and visitors of Ched Nasad. The store offered fashionable, decorative silk wraps and other clothing, but the fiend crouching on its rounded, cocoonlike roof was not interested in making a purchase. Instead, she watched intently as Pharaun and the other two drow males turned away from the slaughter of one of their own race and strolled calmly in the other direction. She observed them as they disappeared down one of the calcified webs that served as a street in the unusual city. When they were almost out of sight, she hopped down from her vantage point and strode off after them.\\n\\n Aliisza was not terribly surprised that the three dark elves she was shadowing had not aided the drunken priestess. She had seen far too much nonchalance in the city since she had arrived for it to strike her as odd. Still, she got the distinct impression that the entire group from Menzoberranzan was making a great effort to avoid drawing attention to itself. She intended to find out why, but first things first.\\n\\n The alu could not help but smile as she made her way along the streets, following the wizard and his companions while pretending to shop for trinkets in the bazaars and markets. She studied the myriad lines of calcified webs that stretched across from one side of the massive cavern to the other, glowing faintly with magical, flickering light as far as the eye could see. She half expected to see some great, lumbering spider making its way across the vast webbing.\\n\\n They sure do love their spider motifs, she thought wryly. Everything they do revolves around the great Lolth, Queen of the Spiders. You\u0027d think they would learn to diversify a little bit, try to become a little more well-rounded.\\n\\n She grinned at her own little joke. Drow were such odd creatures, she decided. On the one hand so deceitful and chaotic, always turning on one another, but on the other hand trying to live their lives by some code or structure, based on the tenets of faith set down by a demon who was as unpredictable as could possibly be.\\n\\n At least they universally agree on one thing, the alu concluded, they all think they\u0027re superior to every other species in the Underdark, and on the surface, too.\\n\\n Aliisza watched as a gaggle of kobold slaves, pushed along by their hobgoblin slavemasters, scurried from one web street down a sloped ramp to the next web street below. All in all, she had seen more species of creature in Ched Nasad than she could imagine being gathered anywhere else. The \"lesser races\" outnumbered the drow by two to one, she figured, and included surface dwarves, orcs, quaggoths, bugbears, and others, almost all of them slaves. The one possible exception to this was the gray dwarves, who traded honestly enough with the drow that they were tolerated in the city as merchants. In addition, Aliisza had seen an aboleth with its host of caretakers, illithids, grell, and what she suspected must be a deep dragon, for though it too was disguised as a dark elf, she detected the unmistakable scent as it strolled by.\\n\\n The one notable exception to the eclectic collection of visitors were the beholders, for which Aliisza was not in the least sorry.\\n\\n There\u0027s a race that\u0027s even more fond of itself than the dark elves, if that\u0027s even possible, the alu thought.\\n\\n Eye tyrants were nothing but trouble as far as Aliisza was concerned, but fortunately they were in a perpetual state of war with the drow, so none were ever seen in the vicinity. If she had caught even a glimpse of one inside the great V-shaped cavern, she would have turned and headed the opposite direction as quickly as was fiendishly possible.\\n\\n The alu blinked, realizing that with all her daydreaming, she was letting her quarry slip away. Glancing around, she spotted the trio of drow heading along a segment of web street toward a wall, into an out-of-the-way part of the city. She realized that they were in the mercantile district, and she recognized quickly enough that Pharaun and the others were headed for an inn set along the end of the dead-end thoroughfare.\\n\\n Good, she thought. Now I can keep an eye on them and still enjoy the sights and sounds for a few days. Maybe I can even get the wizard alone for a little while. . . .\\n\\n Faeryl Zauvirr brooded on the plush bed while Quenthel stalked back and forth in the room they shared at the Flame and Serpent. The high priestess didn\u0027t like to be kept waiting during the best of times, and she certainly didn\u0027t like being kept waiting in the middle of a strange city, tendays away from her homeland, and by three males, no less.\\n\\n That damnable Mizzrym and his infuriating smile, Quenthel thought. I should have Jeggred rend him the moment he returns.\\n\\n But she knew she couldn\u0027t eliminate the wizard or even allow him to be injured. As much as she loathed the situation, Quenthel knew she was dependent on Pharaun as a resource.\\n\\n Butwhen we return to Menzoberranzan . . .\\n\\n The unfinished thought hovered in her mind, not so much because she didn\u0027t know what was to be done with the irritating mage but because she didn\u0027t know when, or if, she would see her home again.\\n\\n It had been so long since she\u0027d last felt the presence of Lolth, had last bathed in the goddess\u0027s glory and favor, that she wondered if she even properly remembered what it felt like.\\n\\n Will it ever return? Is she gone?\\n\\n Stop it! Quenthel silently scolded herself. If you are being rested, fool, then right now, your score is not high. Not high at all. Even if she did send you back for a purpose.\\n\\n Jeggred opened the door and entered, stooping as he did so to avoid the low jamb overhead.\\n\\n \"They are back,\" he growled, sliding the door shut behind him.\\n\\n \"Where in the Hells were they?\" Quenthel asked, still pacing.\\n\\n \"They went for a walk,\" the draegloth answered, shrugging.\\n\\n Quenthel looked over at the creature, who was leering at Faeryl. The ambassador looked miserable under the fiend\u0027s scrutiny, and Quenthel wanted to laugh, remembering some of the things Triel had told her about the Zauvirr\u0027s torture at the hands of Jeggred. Even so, this was not the time.\\n\\n Quenthel snapped, \"Are those worthless males coming, or must I send you to fetch them?\"\\n\\n \"They will be here shortly,\" Jeggred replied, turning away from Faeryl to crouch in a corner. \"The mage told me he had something he needed to look over before they joined us.\" Even down on his haunches, the draegloth was as tall as the high priestess. His white mane of hair cascaded out behind him as he examined the claw of one hand, picking some fleck of something from its surface with the hand of one of his smaller arms. \"They have been drinking,\" he finished, not looking up.\\n\\n Quenthel swore, drawing a look fromFaeryl, but the high priestess didn\u0027t care.\\n\\n Out carousing, like foolish boys! she seethed. When we return, they shall be putto work in the rothe fields.\\n\\n There was a knock at the door, and Quenthel stopped pacing at last, planting her hands on her hips as Jeggred rose to answer it. When he swung the portal open, Pharaun, Valas, and Ryld filed in. Quenthel was surprised to see the grim looks on the faces of the three males.\\n\\n Before anyone had a chance to speak, Pharaun flashed,Someone was watching us today, with magic. No one say a word until I ward the room.\\n\\n With that, he produced a small mirror and a tiny brass horn and used them to cast a spell of some sort, though Quenthel could not see any visible difference. Nor that she expected to, but the idea of the wizard performing spells of his own accord, like everything he did, made her uneasy.\\n\\n \"The city is about to boil over,\" Pharaun said when he was finished casting. He took a seat on the couch and avoided looking directly at Quenthel.\\n\\n He knows he\u0027s about to catch it, the high priestess thought.\\n\\n \"What do you mean? Who\u0027s been watching you? And what were you doing out there, anyway? Didn\u0027t I instruct you to get some rest and meet back here before the evening meal?\"\\n\\n \"Actually, you did not, Mistress,\" Pharaun answered as the other two found places to lean against the far wall. \"You said thatyou were going to rest, and you specifically told us to leave you alone. Under such circumstances, I didn\u0027t see the wisdom in disturbing you with trivialities like a refreshing walk.\"\\n\\n Quenthel sighed. Once again the wizard was twisting her words around, using them to his advantage.\\n\\n \"As for who was watching us, I can\u0027t say. It might have been nothing, just a curious mage checking out some unusual-looking characters as a matter of course and moving on. Then again, it could have been someone specifically worried about us. I didn\u0027t see who was scrying. When I returned, I pulled out my grimoires and studied a spell that would detect scrying, though not stop it from happening. If I give a signal, everyone must be silent.\"\\n\\n Quenthel nodded once, curtly, knowing that the wizard was taking wise precautions.\\n\\n \"Very well,\" she said. \"What did you discover while you were strolling through the city that makes you believe it is about to \u0027boil over\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true,\" Valas said quietly from his corner. \"The lesser races are growing restless. We witnessed an attack today.\"\\n\\n \"So what?\" the high priestess responded. \"They squabble among themselves all the time back home.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but this was a gang of them, assaulting a priestess,\" Ryld said. He was glowering, though at whom, Quenthel was not sure. \"They were bold enough to kill her in front of everyone in an open plaza.\"\\n\\n \"They would dare?\" It was Faeryl, sitting on the edge of the bed, her red eyes glittering with anger, \"And you did nothing?\"\\n\\n \"Truth be told, she was quite inebriated,\" Pharaun said, reclining on the couch. \"Still, she provided us with the proof we needed. Ched Nasad\u0027s clergy suffers the same, ah ... challenges that you do, Mistress.\"\\n\\n Quenthel had folded her arms beneath her breasts and moved to stand in front of the wizard.\\n\\n \"You did nothing to aid her?\" she asked, turning her gaze toward the other two males, watching as they looked away, some notion of guilt on their faces.\\n\\n Pharaun shrugged and said, \"To have interfered would have only drawn attention to the fact that we were in the city, Mistress. If we are to continue to investigate, we must maintain our inconspicuousness. Besides,\" he added, leaning forward again, \"she was pleading for Lolth to return to her, right there in the open courtyard. She had clearly lost her resolution and was not, in my most humble opinion, fit to serve the goddess.\"\\n\\n \"In your - !\" Faeryl seethed. \"The opinion of a mere male is counted upon for very little in most issues. In the matters of the sisterhood, it matters not at all!\"\\n\\n She stood, taking a step toward the wizard. With a gesture from Quenthel, Jeggred was instantly between them. The ambassador shrank back from her one-time tormentor.\\n\\n \"Faeryl, my dear, in this you are usually correct,\" Quenthel said in her most soothing voice. It was one she rarely used, but in this instance she believed it was warranted. For his part, Pharaun gaped at her, which made her smile. \"But, my dear, think on it,\" the high priestess continued. \"The wizard is actually correct, though he may have stumbled upon this conclusion accidentally, addled with brandy though his mind seems to be. I understand your fears, but you must not let them eat away at your logic. If a priestess loses her faith in such a public spectacle, does she do her sisterhood any service?\"\\n\\n Faeryl shook her head as she backed away from Jeggred, returning to her spot on the bed.\\n\\n \"No, of course not,\" she mumbled at last. \"She shames us all with her cowardice.\"\\n\\n \"Precisely,\" Quenthel said, nodding sagely, \"and as foolish as it was for them to be out and about in the first place, these three silly boys would have only caused more harm to our progress if they had made a spectacle of themselves as well.\"\\n\\n \"Forgive my impudence, Mistress Quenthel,\" Faeryl said, her tone dreary \"I have returned home to find my city on the brink of implosion, where thralls dare to assault priestesses in open markets. As you love Menzoberranzan, your city and homeland, so I love Ched Nasad and do not wish to see her come to this end. I forgot myself in a moment of emotion.\"\\n\\n Quenthel dismissed the apology with a wave of her hand.\\n\\n \"Understandable, in this time of crisis,\" she said, \"but you must learn to control that emotion if we are to move forward.\"\\n\\n \"Do I take it, then, that you believe there is still more to be uncovered?\" Pharaun asked.\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" the high priestess answered, pacing once more. \"I am willing to hear what the rest of you think, before I make my decision.\"\\n\\n It was Valas who spoke first.\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s unsafe to remain in the city for long, Mistress,\" the diminutive scout said. \"We have discovered what we came here to learn, and I think it would be wise to return to Menzoberranzan before riots fill the streets and we get caught up in another slave revolt, or worse.\"\\n\\n \"I agree with Valas,\" Ryld added. \"It is clear to me that the clerics here have handled the vanishing of Lolth less well than you and yours back home. There is little they can do for us.\"\\n\\n Quenthel looked to Pharaun, knowing he would have something completely different and unorthodox in mind.\\n\\n Pharaun shifted a bit, eyeing the other two males before saying, \"I think we might do better to investigate further. Valas opened my eyes to another possible avenue of study, one that I would like to take advantage of. There are other races who venerate the Dark Mother besides drow, and it would behoove us to discover whether or nor they, too, suffer her loss.\"\\n\\n Quenthel nodded and said, \"An interesting idea, but not one of much practicality. We are not loved by many others, and I doubt that those who worship Lolth would too freely impart such secretive information to us. Notice how we haven\u0027t been too forthcoming ourselves, even to the dark elves of our sister city. However, as there is still business I consider unfinished here, we will not be going just yet.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, precisely,\" Pharaun replied. \"While you\u0027re busy with all that, I plan to at least look into my theory. I think I might know of a way to confirm it by tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"I have other work for you tomorrow,\" Quenthel said, giving the wizard a cold gaze. \"Faeryl, Jeggred, and I shall pay a visit to the storehouses of Black Claw Mercantile and take what rightfully belongs to House Baenre while the three of you find a means to transport it back. I intend to get out of the city with those goods as quickly as possible. The caravans are long overdue in Menzoberranzan, and we are here to make sure due payment is made.\"\\n\\n Pharaun scowled briefly, and Quenthel was expecting an argument, but the wizard merely stood, nodding again.\\n\\n Pharaun was surprised when Quenthel asked him to remain behind for a moment after dismissing the rest of the group, along with specific instructions to Jeggred to keep an eye on Faeryl, instructions that made the ambassadoractually tremble. The wizard stood silently as Quenthel closed the door, then he cocked an eyebrow at her when she asked him if his detection spells were still in place.\\n\\n \"Yes, as a matter of fact, they are,\" the mage responded. \"The divination should remain in place for a full day\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" the high priestess said, nodding in satisfaction. \"You\u0027re pretty talented with divining information, are you not?\"\\n\\n Pharaun could not help but grin but sat on the couch as he spread his hands ingenuously, wondering why she, of all drow, would pay him a compliment.\\n\\n \"I manage to get by,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I want you to do something for me,\" Quenthel said, biting her lip.\\n\\n Pharaun tipped his head to one side, surprised, for it was not at all like her, especially in recent tendays, to pay him a compliment, much less ask a favor of him.\\n\\n We are indeed a long way from Menzoberranzan, he thought wryly.\\n\\n It would give the wizard leverage if he could perform a genuine task for her, but of course the first notion that popped into his head was the prospect of being played. Shrugging, he motioned for her to speak further.\\n\\n After a lengthy pause, the high priestess said, \"I want you to determine the identity of someone.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Someone?\u0027 \" Pharaun asked. \"Surely you have more for me to work with?\"\\n\\n \"Yes ...\" Quenthel answered, biting her lip again, \"someone who was trying to kill me.\"\\n\\n Pharaun sat upright on the couch, looking directly at the female in front of him.\\n\\n \"Kill you?\"\\n\\n He was surprised, not because it was so inconceivable that Quenthel was the target of an attack - merely being the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith brought with it a host of enemies - but because she had decided to trust him enough with this confidence and the task. If that was indeed what shereally wanted. Maybe she was just trying to occupy his time, keep him from something else. A hundred possibilities swirled in his head.\\n\\n \"Someone back in Menzoberranzan sent several demons after me,\" Quenthel said. \"Sent them right into the Academy. Fortunately, my prowess was sufficient to fend off the attacks, but I would like to put a stop to them before we return. It is a waste of both the lives of my charges and the magic I have been forced to consume in the effort.\"\\n\\n Pharaun nodded, thinking. Someone powerful enough to bend demons to his will had to come from Sorcere, he reasoned. Certainly, plenty of mages in the school of magic had the wherewithal, but how many of them were so interested in eliminating Quenthel Baenre?\\n\\n \"I will look into it,\" the Master of Sorcere said. \"If I can determine who sent the fiends in your direction, you will be the first to know it.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" Quenthel said. \"You will tell no one of this, not even the other members of our expedition.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not, Mistress,\" Pharaun replied. \"This issue is between the two of us, and the two of us only.\"\\n\\n \"Very well,\" the high priestess said, indicating that the meeting was at an end. \"Ferret out my enemy, and when we return to Menzoberranzan in triumph, I will make certain you are duly honored for your part. Your future at Tier Breche will be as bright as Narbondel.\"\\n\\n Pharaun bowed low as a gesture of thanks.\\n\\n If by that you mean I will glow with the flame of a thousand of your killing spells, he thought, then we shall see.\\n\\n \"I look forward to the accolades, Mistress Quenthel,\" the mage said aloud, and with that he pulled the door open for her and followed her out to attend to the evening meal with the others.\\n\\n Gromph sat at his bone desk, mulling over his inability to peer into the Demonweb where Lolth resided. None of his usual scrying spells had been successful, and he was growing irritated. He was considering ways to get around this dilemma when the message arrived. It was a mere whisper, but Gromph nonetheless recognized Pharaun Mizzrym\u0027s magically transmitted voice.\\n\\n Reached Ched Nasad. City in chaos; matron mothers ruling in name only. Investigating new possibility, more information next communication. Quenthel to visit Black Claw tomorrow.\\n\\n Gromph\u0027s mouth tightened at the mention of his sister.\\n\\n Hopefully, she will not come back, he thought.\\n\\n The archmage knew of the spell the other wizard was using to communicate, and he was aware that he could whisper an answer to his counterpart. Unfortunately, he had not prepared for this. Thinking quickly, he whispered a few instructions.\\n\\n \"Focus attention on gathering information to aid our own situation. Keep me apprised of all new possibilities. Report on success at Black Claw with next - \\n\\n \" - contact,\" Gromph finished, but he knew that the spell had winked out before he\u0027d managed to utter the last word. He shook his head, disgruntled, but he knew the Mizzrym was clever enough to figure out what he meant, regardless. Whether he would follow those instructions or not was an entirely different matter.\\n\\n The Baenre wizard sat back in his chair, contemplating for a moment, pondering what condition the expedition team was likely to be in. He especially wondered how his sister fared and if the strain of his own attacks, coupled with the journey, had taken their toll. He certainly hoped so.\\n\\n He suspected that she and Pharaun were clashing on a regular basis. The wizard was too independent, too full of himself to know when to placate the high priestess, and she had been too long inside the Academy, too used to getting her own way, unwilling to listen to advice, no matter how reasonable.\\n\\n That\u0027s my sister, the archmage thought, frowning.\\n\\n It often seemed to Gromph as if both of his sisters made poor decisions for no other purpose than to spite others. Even if Quenthel did survive her journey, Gromph thought she might very well be ripe for the slaughter when she returned.If she returned. If Quenthel were to lead the expedition into disaster in Ched Nasad, it would certainly be to Gromph\u0027s advantage. He could be rid of both her and the Mizzrym fop in one very charming blow. Yet, the fate of Menzoberranzan might very well rest on their shoulders. Was sending them off together the wisest choice?\\n\\n Still uncertain what his next step would be regarding his own investigations of Lolth\u0027s domain, but with a whole new set of issues to deal with, Gromph arose from behind his bone desk and hurried to find his sister.\\n\\n Triel scowled slightly when she saw Gromph enter the audience chamber. It was not a time for public petitioning, and though her brother was hardly some common supplicant, she had hoped to avoid any visitations for a while. The matron mother straightened herself in the overly large throne as her brother approached. The archmage bowed low and stepped close, further irritating the matron mother. She liked everyone to keep a little distance.\\n\\n Gromph kept his voice low, leaning in so as to nearly whisper, \"Triel, I have news.\"\\n\\n Triel doubted the guards outside, flanking the doors, were going to hear a normal conversation, but her brother had not become Archmage of Menzoberranzan through carelessness. She inclined her head to listen.\\n\\n \"Do tell,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Quenthel and the others have reached Ched Nasad,\" the archmage said. \"Pharaun Mizzrym reports that the city is in an uproar. Apparently, Menzoberranzan is not the only city afflicted with Lolth\u0027s disfavor.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know that it is disfavor!\" Triel snapped. \"There may be another explanation.\"\\n\\n Gromph inclined his head slightly in apology.\\n\\n \"Afflicted with her absence,\" he corrected himself. \"But the matron mothers there have done a poor job of keeping the situation quiet.\"\\n\\n \"How bad is it?\"\\n\\n \"I gathered that trouble could be brewing . . . major trouble.\"\\n\\n Triel sighed. As much of a relief as it was to find out Menzoberranzan was not being singled out for some sort of punishment, the news didn\u0027t get them any closer to discovering why the Dark Mother had chosen to disappear. Triel was at a loss as tothe next step.\\n\\n \"Did he say what they were planning to do?\" she asked her brother.\\n\\n \"Quenthel seems intent on following through with your instructions to bring back goods from Black Claw,\" Gromph replied.\\n\\n The idea of more magical supplies lifted Triel\u0027s spirits slightly, but only slightly.\\n\\n \"Then I suppose they\u0027ll be returning within a few tendays,\" she said. \"We are really no closer to an answer than we were when they left. It is only a matter of time before Menzoberranzan is in the same difficulties as her sister city.\"\\n\\n \"Unfortunately, you may be more correct than you understand.\"\\n\\n \"What other dire news do you have to report?\"\\n\\n If this was the way her mornings were going to start out, Triel considered remaining in Reverie until the midday meal a preferable alternative to actually rising and dealing with the issues at hand.\\n\\n \"I have received reports that our patrols are encountering a lot more activity around the perimeter of the city.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of activity?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly what you might expect,\" Gromph said. \"Though nothing has actually happened, no skirmishes breaking out, our patrols have spotted what looks to be scouting parties surveying our situation. Duergar, deep gnomes, and even kuo-toans have been spotted in greater-than-normal numbers.\"\\n\\n \"They know. They can tell that things aren\u0027t right.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps. Or, they could simply be passing by ... traveling to somewhere else, and we\u0027ve simply grown more sensitive to their presence.\"\\n\\n \"I doubt it,\" she replied. \"This can\u0027t last. We\u0027re going to have to confront the situation soon. I will bring this up at the next council meeting.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Gromph said and made a move to withdraw.\\n\\n Triel motioned that her brother was dismissed and told herself that it was time to get on with her day, but she continued to brood atop her throne for some time after that.\\n\\n Quenthel was thankful she had Jeggred along for the trip from the Flame and Serpent to the storehouse district. The mood of the city had grown worse since even the previous day, and the drow received more than a few menacing looks and jostles as they moved through the streets. Fortunately, the trio didn\u0027t have to travel far to get to where they needed to go, and much of the journey was made by way of levitation. Faeryl was in a sullen mood, despite the fact that she seemed more than eager to aid the Menzoberranyr. Perhaps she was still displeased with Quenthel\u0027s lack of trust, or maybe she simply couldn\u0027t abide Jeggred\u0027s presence. The high priestess couldn\u0027t blame her. The draegloth took such delight in tormenting Faeryl, Quenthel almost felt sorry for the younger drow. Almost.\\n\\n Quenthel had sent the males to procure transportation for the return trip to Menzoberranzan. She wasn\u0027t about to haul her own provisions on her back again, whether they managed to locate a stockpile of goods or not, and if they did they would need sufficient pack lizards and guards to ensure the materials arrived safely.\\n\\n Valas had warned the high priestess that anyone worth his salt wasgoing to command an exorbitant price, if he could be convinced to work at all, but Quenthel didn\u0027t care and told the scout so.\\n\\n Why is it, Quenthel thought as they approached Black Claw\u0027s storehouses from a back street, where there were fewer folk milling about, that with males you always have to explain things to them in exacting detail? Why can\u0027t they just do as they\u0027re told and be done with it?\\n\\n Pharaun was the worst, she decided. Quenthel had no doubt that the wizard was off doing his own little tasks, completely ignoring her instructions to him to help Valas and Ryld. He had an infuriating habit of ignoring her wishes, and she would have to do something about that - when they got back to Menzoberranzan, of course. She needed his talents too much until then.\\n\\n \"Now, remember,\" Quenthel warned Faeryl as they neared the office side of the storehouse. \"Tell them only what I instructed you. If I\u0027m not happy with this little encounter, Jeggred will make sure it\u0027s not a problem in the future.\"\\n\\n The draegloth was strolling along behind the two priestesses, and Faeryl stole a quick glance over her shoulder at him. Quenthel noticed her faint shudder and smiled to herself. It turned out to be quite useful that Triel had set Jeggred upon the girl back in Menzoberranzan. It had made her so ... compliant.\\n\\n \"Yes, Mistress Quenthel,\" Faeryl replied. \"I understand.\"\\n\\n The three of them were at the door to the storehouse, where a contingent of six House Zauvirr guards barred the entrance. Faeryl approached boldly, even as the males goggled at the sight of the towering draegloth behind her.\\n\\n \"We must inspect the stores,\" Faeryl said in what Quenthel thought was a surprisingly commanding voice. \"Stand aside and let us enter.\"\\n\\n The male who appeared to be the leader managed to pull his gaze away from Jeggred long enough to look at her quizzically.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know you,\" he said. \"What is your business?\"\\n\\n Faeryl stepped closer, standing a little taller so that he was forced to peer up at her scowling face. She grasped the House insignia that was pinned to herpiwafwi and thrust it into his view.\\n\\n \"You know this, don\u0027t you?\" she snapped, shaking the insignia. \"You\u0027re here to keep out the riffraff, stupid boy, not bother a personal envoy of Matron Mothers Zauvirr and Melarn.\"\\n\\n Quenthel noted with satisfaction that the lad gulped, visibly shaken as he moved with haste to the side, allowing Faeryl access to the door. The ambassador stepped inside, with the high priestess and Jeggred right behind her. As Quenthel strolled past, she smiled sweetly at one of the males, who still gaped at the draegloth, his eyes wide.\\n\\n Inside the storehouse, which appeared to have been spun from webbing and hardened to stone, Faeryl led the way through an office area, through a large door, and into a cavernous chamber that had been subdivided into storage areas by low walls. Her footsteps echoing in the vast storeroom, Faeryl walked across the stone floor, hurrying past row after row of shelves and bins. Quenthel followed her, figuring the ambassador knew the way to the most valuable hoards of magic.\\n\\n Quenthel supposed there was a secure section of the storehouse, and she began to worry. Any magic of value would likely be warded.\\n\\n I should have brought that fop Mizzrym along, after all, she chided herself. \"Mistress!\" Yngoth hissed, rising up from the whip. \"We are in danger!\"\\n\\n Quenthel spun around, looking for signs of a threat, but she could see nothing.\\n\\n \"What danger?\" she demanded. \"Where?\"\\n\\n \"A force is here . . . drow,\" Zinda answered, and all five of the snakes were agitating against her hip.\\n\\n \"Drow and others,\" Zinda added.\\n\\n Someone\u0027s hiding, the high priestess realized. What have you done, insolent child?\\n\\n A heartbeat later, a small host of drow appeared from behind a low wall, soldiers with swords and hand crossbows at the ready, and a handful of House wizards, too. They were all from House Zauvirr. Quenthel recognized two of the dark elves as matron mothers. It was obvious simply by their demeanor and bearing. One bore the insignia of House Zauvirr, and she was smiling coldly. The other, a rather plump drow, was most definitely not smiling and in fact looked quite distressed.\\n\\n \"By the Dark Mother,\" one of the males standing near Faeryl breathed, raising his crossbow and sighting down it at the fiend.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s dangerous,\" Faeryl called out, but several of the House wizards were already in action, casting spells even as the draegloth sprang forward, his teeth bared and his claws out, ready to shred anyone and everyone to ribbons. Faeryl took an involuntary step back, shuddering. Jeggred remained still, crouching as though he would spring again, snarling in fury, but unmoving otherwise.\\n\\n \"That will hold him,\" one of the wizards claimed.\\n\\n Quenthel gasped in surprise, looking back and forth between Jeggred and Faeryl.\\n\\n \"Yes, Quenthel,\" Faeryl called out. \"He has been rendered helpless. He cannot extract you from this.\"\\n\\n Quenthel returned her glare to Faeryl as the soldiers fanned out, moving to surround her but staying well back. Many of the males aimed crossbows at her, and the wizards and priestesses all seemed ready to invoke various spells, should the Mistress of the Academy decide to bolt or attack. The snakes of Quenthel\u0027s whip writhed in agitation, snapping at anyone who steppedtoo close.\\n\\n \"You insolent little whelp of a drow,\" Quenthel snarled, shaking in fury as she looked at Faeryl, who only smiled sweetly in return. \"All that time being so agreeable, and it was a lie. I knew you were being too accommodating. I should have let Jeggred have his way with you back in the wilds. I will see you flayed for this.\"\\n\\n \"That might prove difficult,MistressQuenthel,\" Faeryl said, putting as much sarcasm as possible into her tone when she came to the honorific. \"If you give this situation just a moment\u0027s thought, you will see, I\u0027m sure, that you are overmatched. It really would be better if you surrendered this foolish standoff.\"\\n\\n Quenthel blinked, weighing the ambassador\u0027s words. Finally, reluctantly, she realized that she was overmatched and nodded.\\n\\n \"Excellent, Mistress,\" Faeryl said. \"Now, I think it would be a wise idea for you to lay down your arms and all of those wonderful trinkets I know you carry about yourself.\"\\n\\n Quenthel\u0027s glare deepened, but she carefully set the whip down at her feet.\\n\\n \"Come on, Quenthel,\" Faeryl admonished. \"I\u0027ve been traveling with you for several tendays now. I know about the ring and the rod and all the other things. Don\u0027t make this more difficult.\"\\n\\n Sighing, Quenthel began to remove the various items, and when Faeryl seemed satisfied that the high priestess could no longer be a significant threat, she ordered her to step away from the pile of goods.\\n\\n As others swooped in and gathered up Quenthel\u0027s possessions, Faeryl stepped closer to Quenthel, smiling again.\\n\\n \"I am sorry it had to be this way, Quenthel,\" she said, \"but I\u0027m sure you understand.\"\\n\\n Quenthel, who had regained some of her composure, smiled right back.\\n\\n \"Oh, I quite understand, Ambassador. My sister will be highly disappointed when she learns what you have done, but I wouldn\u0027t worry too much about that. It\u0027s a shame though ... if there\u0027s one thing Triel will miss more than her sister, it would have to be her beloved son.\"\\n\\n Faeryl didn\u0027t let her smile falter, but Quenthel thought the ambassador might have swallowed just a little nervously at the thought of the Matron Mother of House Baenre hearing the news that her draegloth had been destroyed.\\n\\n Faeryl shrugged and said, \"That\u0027s a worry for another time, Mistress. Now, if you will be so kind as to walk with me, I\u0027ll introduce Matron Mother Drisinil Melarn and my own mother, Mistress Ssipriina Zauvirr. They are most interested in hearing more about how you planned to steal our provisions and take them back to Menzoberranzan with you.\"\\n\\n \"Those goods belong in Menzoberranzan. They are ours by right,\" Quenthel said, angry all over again.\\n\\n In the back of her mind, a part of her told herself that she really did need to learn to control her anger better, but she didn\u0027t want to listen.\\n\\n Faeryl laughed cynically. \"You didn\u0027t actually think I was going to let you steal from my House, did you?\" she said. \"From my city? You are mad!\" Taking a calming breath, the ambassador continued, ice dripping from her voice, \"Look around you, Mistress Baenre. This is what\u0027s left of your precious stores of goods.\"\\n\\n For the first time, Quenthel realized that the rows and rows of shelves and bins were mostly empty. There was nothing in there to take. She had been thoroughly tricked, from the beginning of the journey, perhaps, played for the fool that she was. The betrayal was not unexpected, and Quenthel knew that had the roles been reversed, House Baenre would have carried the situation to the same conclusion. What galled her was that whatever foolish Baenre whelp had been responsible for the logistics of the deal had never bothered to put enough troops loyal to the House in place to ensure that nothing like this ever happened. Quenthel suspected that whatever loyal forces had been here had been summarily rounded up and executed when the crisis grew. The fact that no one was there now was a testament to that.\\n\\n \"What have you done with it?\" Quenthel demanded, half interested in the answer and half stalling for time so she could assess the situation better.\\n\\n Though there were a number of drow troops there, there was still a chance she could escape - though it would require leaving Jeggred behind.\\n\\n Faeryl laughed, \"Oh, don\u0027t worry. Black Claw made a tidy profit recently. The stock has been put to a far better use than what you intended, Mistress.\"\\n\\n The mockery in the girl\u0027s tone was unmistakable.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough, Faeryl,\" Ssipriina Zauvirr said, takinga couple of steps forward. \"There\u0027s no need to ruin the surprise we have in store for our guests.\"\\n\\n As Faeryl lowered her head slightly in deference to her mother, she made her face stony smooth, but Quenthel knew that behind that facade, the Zauvirr daughter was delighted to have thwarted her.\\n\\n Matron Mother Melarn also stepped forward - or rather, two heavily armed drow stepped forward, escorting her between them. She still frowned deeply, but she said nothing.\\n\\n Ssipriina Zauvirr strolled halfway toward Quenthel and stopped.\\n\\n \"When my son managed to get into private contact with Faeryl and she was able to tell us what you were planning, we of course wasted no time in preparing for your arrival. I have to say, I am more than a little surprised that you actually expected to slip a storehouse full of goods out of the city, out from under our noses, without us noticing, but that\u0027s really of no consequence. As my daughter indicated, House Zauvirr has put the profits to a far better use.\"\\n\\n Quenthel blinked in confusion.\\n\\n \"House Zauvirr?\" she asked. \"You are merely the caretakers. This company belongs to Houses Melarn and Baenre.\" The high priestess turned to the other matron mother and said, \"Are you permitting this? Are you content to let these deceitful, low-classmerchants make the decisions for your investments? You are far more trusting than I.\"\\n\\n Drisinil Melarn didn\u0027t say a word, though she grimaced slightly when Quenthel spoke to her, Ssipriina Zauvirr laughed, a quick, bitter sound.\\n\\n \"Oh, she is far from content, Quenthel Baenre, but she has little choice in the matter.\"\\n\\n Quenthel realized just why Matron Mother Melarn seemed so unhappy. The two drow flanking her were not escorts but guards.\\n\\n \"You would dare?\" Quenthel asked. \"You have laid hands on the matron mother of a high House of your own city and hope to get away with it? How can you expect to survive, when . . . when - \"\\n\\n The high priestess clamped her mouth shut, unwilling to finish the thought.\\n\\n When Lolth will not grant you spells.\\n\\n \"Oh, not to worry,\" Ssipriina said, smiling even more deeply than before. \"With the funds I\u0027ve made selling off your valuables, I have ensured that House Zauvirr will never again kneel before the likes of you two.\"\\n\\n Her eyes glittered red as she finished, and Quenthel saw pure hatred burning in them.\\n\\n \"Captain Xornbane, if you please?\" Ssipriina called. All around the drow gathering, appearing from nowhere, a horde of gray dwarves stood in a large circle, brandishing wicked-looking axes and heavy crossbows. Clearly, they had been standing there for a few moments but had simply been invisible. The duergar looked confident, ready for anything.\\n\\n Quenthel felt the pit of her stomach leap into her throat, but before she could take any action she felt an invisible force seize her and hold her motionless. She couldn\u0027t move a muscle and saw that Drisinil Melarn was in a similar condition.\\n\\n \"Shall we kill them now?\" one of the duergar asked, stepping forward. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurrection-war-of-the-spider-queen-2/page-7.html","bookId":2160,"book":{"id":2160,"title":"Insurrection (War of the Spider Queen #2)","description":"Storyline: Insurrection (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
