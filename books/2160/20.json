{"id":97362,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"\"When the fighting got worse, several of the matron mothers, including Maerret, came to the Dangling Tower and asked us to aid them,\" Q\u0027arlynd explained. \"They said it was a full-scale civil war and the rebels were going to tear the city apart if we didn\u0027t stop them. Matron Mother Lirdnolu explained to me what had happened to House Melarn. I knew Mother was dead, and we\u0027d heard that she was killed by Ssipriina Zauvirr with collaborators from the outside who wanted to see the downfall of Ched Nasad.\" \"And you thought I\u0027d perished, too,\" Halisstra said, squatting down beside her brother. \"Yes, either at the same time Mother was murdered or in the fall of our House. Is it really gone?\" the Melarn wizard asked. Halisstra only nodded. \"By the Dark Mother,\" he breathed. \"Well, the family reunion is nice and all, but we still need to get out of this city,\" Pharaun said, standing. \"What\u0027s the situation? Where\u0027s the closest way out that we can get through?\" Q\u0027arlynd shook his head and said, \"There are none, so I\u0027ve heard. All the gates have either been commandeered by rebel forces or hordes of escaped slaves or they\u0027ve collapsed outright because of the fighting. This alchemical fire that burns through stone is wreaking havoc on - \" \"Believe me, we know,\" the Master of Sorcere interrupted, \"but your report doesn\u0027t leave us with many options. We\u0027ve got to find a way to get free of the city.\" Quenthel had just opened her mouth, most likely tocommand Pharaun to figure out a method of escaping Ched Nasad, the wizard imagined, when a commotion broke out from farther down the boulevard. Pharaun turned and looked just in time to see a jumble of dark elves stumbling to their feet in disarray. Many of them fell again just as quickly, cut down by a growing horde of gray dwarves who were emerging through a magical doorway hovering in the air only a couple of feet above the street. The duergar were streaming through as fast as they could, firing off crossbows at any drow targets they could find before casting the missile weapons aside and pulling out axes, hammers, and the occasional mace. \"Attack! We\u0027re under attack!\" the cry went up as more drow surged to their feet, moving to stop the advance of the gray dwarves. \"Come on, you flat-footed, sorry excuses for soldiers - get up there and fight before they split us down the middle!\" the battle priestess yelled, returning from the far end of the street and shoving troops forward as fast as shecould get to them. \"Wizard! Throw a spell! Drive them back. If they reach the square, we\u0027re done for.\" Pharaun sighed and nodded, grabbing the battle priestess and spinning her around to face him. His smile was gone. \"Tell your troops to fall back to this point,\" he said. \"What? And let them come at us unopposed? I think not.\" \"Do it, or they will be trapped. Set up three positions of missile fire, here - \" he pointed to several positions in the street - \"there, and there.\" The battle priestess looked at the mage as though he were crazy but finally nodded and shouted for an organized retreat. Pharaun rolled his eyes at the battle priestess\u0027s short-sightedness and began organizing the drow soldiers himself, sorting them into groups of crossbowmen, stationing them where he\u0027d pointed earlier. As more and more of the dark elves dropped back from the duergar, they fell in with the others already positioned. As a unit, they began to fire into the mass of milling gray dwarves, who were slaughtering the few remaining stragglers. They\u0027re lost to us, the wizard said to himself. He cast, and a great mass of webs appeared, spanning the width of the street, anchored to the pavement and the buildings on either side. A handful of the dark elves were caught in the sticky strands, and perhaps a dozen or so were trapped on the other side, but the gray dwarves were effectively sealed off from advancing, at least until they penetrated the webs or the spell wore off. \"Come on,\" Q\u0027arlynd said, motioning upward as he began to levitate. Pharaun followed the other wizard upward to a position where they could see over the top of his webs, down into the field of battle where the gray dwarves had quickly killed the few remaining drow who had been trapped with them. The duergar were milling about, seemingly unsure what to do. Halisstra\u0027s brother had components out, ready to cast a spell, and one look at the lump of bat guano in his hand told Pharaun what the wizard planned. \"Hold on,\" Pharaun said, laying a hand on Q\u0027arlynd\u0027s arm. \"They\u0027re waiting,\" he explained, pointing down at the duergar. \"They want a shaman or something to come try to dispel the webs. He\u0027s probably the same one who opened the dimensional doorway.\" Sure enough, a duergar dressed in robes and wearing several totems and other magical trinkets stepped through the glowing doorway. One of the duergar addressed him - Pharaun couldn\u0027t hear what was being said - and pointed to the webs. The shaman nodded and began to cast. \"Do it,\" Pharaun said. Q\u0027arlynd went into action, letting loose with his spell, aiming it directly at the shaman. It was a direct hit, and that entire side of the street was engulfed in a white-hot ball of fire that blossomed outward and vaporized an instant later. Charred and burning gray dwarves lay everywhere. A few moved, having survived, but they were few and far between. Most importantly, the dimensional pathway had been banished, winking outwhen the shaman who created it died. The two wizards settled back to the ground again, noting that Q\u0027arlynd\u0027s fiery ball of magic had ignited the webs, which were quickly burning away. Already, though, another gateway was forming, this one at the opposite end of the street. The battle priestess rallied her troops to deal with the new threat. \"You know you only delayed the inevitable,\" Quenthel said as Pharaun and Q\u0027arlynd returned. \"We\u0027re wasting time, here. We have to get out of the city.\" \"I know,\" the Master of Sorcere replied, \"but it was fun.\" \"Look!\" Danifae shouted, pointing toward the new gateway. Duergar were streaming out, and drow were arriving from above and below, levitating from the web streets on the two adjacent levels. \"It\u0027s House Zauvirr troops,\" the battle captive explained. \"They\u0027ve got us pinned.\" \"Fall back,\" the battle priestess commanded, turning to point back the way the duergar had come, but as she began to direct her soldiers, she took a crossbow bolt in the ear. The missile passed through and protruded from the other side of her head, and she was alreadydead, motionless, as she fell to the pavement. \"We\u0027re surrounded!\" Q\u0027arlynd cried out. \"Stand and fight!\" He produced a wand and waved it, conjuring a sudden and violent tempest of ice fragments the size of Pharaun\u0027s head. The chunks of ice pelted down on the front ranks of gray dwarves, beating them down and slicing them to ribbons amid cries of anguish. In reply, the duergar began throwing more of the firepots into the ever-tightening mass of House Maerret drow, who were bunched together and made easy targets. More and more of the gray dwarves appeared, forming ranks, establishing a shield wall in front so that the back ranks would have protection as they fired crossbows and hurled firepots and spells. Pharaun had no idea where any of his companions were. Everyone had been scattered in the initial panic of the attack. He had no concerns that they couldn\u0027t take care of themselves, at least for the moment, but the longer they remained there, the less their chances became of escaping at all. He spun in place, looking for a sign of any of them in the thickening smoke, when a creature materialized in front of the wizard, its back to him. Pharaun\u0027s ability to note magical emanations made it clear to him that this creature had been summoned from somewhere, most likely the lower planes. It was a huge thing, vaguely humanoid, covered with white fur and possessed of four arms. It had a sloping brow and a flattened nose, but the most terrifying aspect was its gaping mouth and fangs. The beast spun around, roaring in rage, and spotted the wizard. Its red eyes glittered in delight as it lunged forward, claws outstretched, ready to rend the Master of Sorcere. Pharaun fumbled to free his rapier, but the fiendish creature was on him too fast, and he took a painful slash across the shoulder that knocked him sideways several feet. The wizard stumbled to the ground as the thing bounded forward again, pounding its chest with all four fists and roaring a challenge. Goddess, Pharaun thought in a panic, scrambling backward and trying to activate his rapier. From one side, a flash of movement caught the mage\u0027s eye, and Valas darted in behind the beast, raking both kukris along its hamstrings. The beast roared in pain but amazingly, it spun around before Valas could blend into the surroundings, slashing at the diminutive scout with outstretched claws. Pharaun heard the other drow grunt and watched him go sprawling from the force of the blow, but it bought him the time he needed to get his rapier free. He mentally commanded the thin blade to attack, and when it jabbed at the beast, which was looming over Valas, the creature snarled and spun back to see what hadhurt it. Valas scrambled to his feet and faded from sight. The fiendish thing growled and roared, swiping at the dancing rapier, but the blade was too quick, darting and weaving and getting several pokes in. Already, the white fur of the monster was tainted red from multiple wounds. This only seemed to be enraging the beast further, and Pharaun had to suppress a grin. With the blade now protecting him from attack, the wizard could cast a spell. He gestured and uttered a few syllables, and instantly,he was surrounded by more than half a dozen exact duplicates of himself that flickered and spun about. At the same time, a clay pot shattered right at the feet of the summoned creature, engulfing it in flames. It screamed in pain and flailed about, and Pharaun was forced to back a few steps to avoid it as it went running to escape its torment. Blinded by fire and pain, the fiendish creature charged over the side of the web street, vanishing into the void below. Pharaun turned to assay the battle, his rapier still bobbing and weaving, waiting for a target, and the wizard nearly got his head taken off by a series of whirling blades. This spell he knew well enough, for it was a favorite of the priestesses, but he doubted that any of the drow had cast it. Two of the spinning blades tore through hispiwafwi,nipping at his arm and creating quick, thin lines of blood. Instinctively, he dropped to the ground, avoiding the full brunt of the spell, though several of his duplicates vanished after being struck. The mage rolled out from beneath the spinning range of the spell and regained his feet. Quenthel was nearby, a wand in one hand and her whip in the other. She was slashing at a duergar with her whip, and at the same time, Pharaun noted, she was directing a glowing, floating apparition of a hammer about with the wand. She swiped at the gray dwarf with her whip,and as he backed up to avoid the attack, she brought the hammer in from behind, slamming it into the back of his skull. The duergar jerked once, his eyes rolled up into his head, and he crumpled to the ground. Ryld maneuvered into view, swinging Splitter all around himself. Pharaun could see that the Master of Melee-Magthere was engaged with three drow, and the way they were handling their own weapons, it appeared that Ryld had matched up with fellow weapons masters. The three opponents stalked around him, feinting and jabbing, trying to get the warrior to over-commit on defense, but Ryld maintained his position, flowing from one stance to the next. Pharaun could see that, despite the exhaustion that was apparent in Ryld\u0027s heavy breathing, there was also a gleam in the weapons master\u0027s eye. It was taking every ounce of concentration Ryld had, but he actually seemed to be enjoying the challenge. Black, waving tentacles appeared among Ryld and his three adversaries, and Pharaun watched as two of the writhing appendages latched on to the Master of Melee-Magthere, while several more slithered around the legs and ankles of his foes. All four of the combatants were trapped, and yet none of them was willing to lower his guard in order to try to free himself. Reacting quickly, Pharaun yanked his wand free of hispiwafwiand triggered it, sending five screaming points of light into the first of the two tentacles that held Ryld down. The tentacle spasmed and vanished. With a quick spin of his greatsword, Ryld cut through the second black, shiny appendage, then leaped into the air as more of the writhing things reached for him. He levitated upward, out of range of the three weapons masters, who were struggling to free themselves. Before they could, though, a handful of duergar closed in, firing crossbows at the helpless drow, and the dark elves went down quickly. Pharaun could see that House Maerret\u0027s position had been completely overrun. Duergar had closed in on one side, and drow on the other. The fight was simply a mad, whirling jumble of perhaps three dozen combatants fighting for their lives. What few remaining forces of House Maerret still survived were dropping quickly. Opponents closed in from all sides, and soon enough, Pharaun was reunited with his companions as the circle that surrounded them drew tighter and tighter. \"We\u0027re out of time,\" Quenthel said, still swinging her whip and directing magical hammers at her foes. \"Do something now, wizard!\" \"You!\" came an angry shout from behind Pharaun. He turned to see who was making the commotion, and standing there, facing Quenthel, was Ssipriina Zauvirr, glaring at all of them. \"You are the reason for all of this!\" she screamed, raising her mace and pointing at them. \"You should never have come to Ched Nasad!\" \"Zauvirr!\" came a second angry shout, a much more gruff voice, from the other side. Pharaun turned back the way he had originally been watching and spotted a large, well-armored duergar, one obviously of rank. \"Foolish drow, I will see you dead!\" the gray dwarf called. \"Betrayer!\" Ssipriina spat back. \"I should have known better than to trust you, Khorrl Xornbane. You can die with the meddlers. Kill them,\" she cried to her few remaining soldiers, who were massing in a line. \"Kill them all!\" \"Death to all drow!\" Khorrl Xornbane roared, and motioned his handful of troops forward. Pharaun\u0027s shoulders sagged. We\u0027re never going to get out of here, he thought, swinging his magical rapier around. Thick black smoke from the burning stone was blinding Ryld, making it hard to see more than a few feet in any direction. The battlefield had suddenly grown quiet. There were no more explosions, no flashing bursts from the firepots. Only the sound of steel on steel, but even that was greatly diminished. He stepped forward to meet an onrushing contingent of gray dwarves. To his left, Halisstra also entered the fray, her heavy mace and an impressive mithral shield held ready. Quenthel took up a position on the warrior\u0027s other side, swinging her whip back and forth experimentally as she advanced. The duergar, dozens of them, fanned out to meet the eclectic group, bloodlust plain in their eyes. Two came directly at Ryld, battle-axes held high. The weapons master parried the first swing at his shoulder and sidestepped a cut to the knees from his second foe. He brought the greatsword down atop the axe, snapping the haft cleanly, but then had to shift his weight almost off-balance to avoid a punching dagger to the ribs. Spinning, he kicked out with one booted foot, catching the gray dwarf square on the wrist and sending the dagger flying. A third duergar loomed up behind Ryld, holding a length of chain that he spun in a circle over his head. Ryld saw that the foe was eyeing his legs, so when the attack came, he managed to leap high enough that the metal links missed him and went skittering across the pavement. In mid-leap, Ryld managed to turn completely around, flicking his blade across the head of the first gray dwarf\u0027s axe, unable to knock it completely loose, but nonetheless managing to force the combatant off-balance. As he landed, Ryld swung Splitter back around again, swiping at the chain-wielder\u0027s throat. The duergar jerked back from the attack, reeling in his chain for another attempt then stiffened in pain as the head of Danifae\u0027s morning star came down squarely on his skull in an enchanted shower of sparks. The creature slumped over as Danifae spun away to attack another foe. Ryld maneuvered back around to face his original foe, who had regained his balance and had bis axe level again. His companion, holding his injured wrist limply at his side, had fumbled a smaller hand axe free and was circling around Ryld, still trying to maneuver behind the weapons master. Ryld stepped back as though he were trying to avoid being surrounded, even as he casually blocked a couple of strokes from the battle-axe. Finally, when he saw the gray dwarf rear back for another, even more powerful cut, he planted his toe inside the coils of chain that the downed duergar had been swinging and flipped it up with his leg. As the chain sprayed out, it caught the humanoid squarely in the face. The duergar flinched, ruining his attack. The Master of Melee-Magthere saw the hand axe coming toward his shoulder and twisted himself so that the blade just missed him then flicked Splitter back and up, slicing cleanly through the gray dwarf\u0027s arm at the elbow. Howling in agony, the duergar stumbled away, letting the momentum of the blow bear him out of harm\u0027s way. Ryld let the sword swing spin him completely around so that he planted his feet facing once more in the direction of the original enemy, who had disentangled himself from the chain and had flung it away. Ryld shifted his greatsword a couple times, circling with the gray dwarf, the two of them warily sizing one another up. The weapons master stepped into a handful of slices and thrusts, flinging halfhearted attacks toward the dwarf that never really threatened it but allowed Ryld to see just how eager his opponent was to engage with him. The gray dwarf shied away from every cut and parry, and the Master of Melee-Magthere knew the duergar would break off the fight soon, assuming its companions dwindled to sufficiently small numbers around it. Ryld stepped into an attack again, keeping his blade low and squarely in front of him, and the duergar trod backward another step. Then, as if out of nowhere, Valas appeared from the shadows, swinging one of his kukris low across the gray dwarf\u0027s hamstring. The duergar\u0027s knee buckled, and the scout came over the top with his other blade, stabbing it into the creature\u0027s chest. The duergar made a gurgling sound as he shivered and fell over. The Master of Melee-Magthere shifted his attention elsewhere as soon as he saw the threat eliminated. He spied Jeggred ripping a drow to shreds. Only two others were visible, looking for a way to get inside the draegloth\u0027s reach, but Ryld doubted that would be the case for long. Another dark elf was fighting to keep Pharaun\u0027s rapier away from him, but Quenthel was closing on his flank, and the high priestess lashed out with her scourge, allowing the snake heads to sink their teeth deeply into the creature\u0027s neck. Jerking from the sudden sting of the bites, the drow was unable to maintain his attention on the rapier, which ran through his eye. Another foe was squared off with Halisstra, who warded off a pair of stout blows with her mithral shield. On the third stroke from the dark elf across from her, she used the shield to deflect the strike and throw her opponent off-balance, then swung the heavy mace in her other hand upward in a vicious stroke, right into his chin. There was a loud, drumlike boom, a magical concussion that was obviously much louder than the simple impact of metal on bone, and the drow sank to the ground, his jaw shattered. Breathing heavily, Ryld surveyed the battlefield. In addition to his six companions and Halisstra\u0027s brother, the only ones still standing were a small circle of perhaps a dozen exhausted drow and duergar who had ceased fighting for the moment and were watching as the duergar commander squared off with Ssipriina Zauvirr. The gray dwarf and the matron mother circled one another warily, as smoke wafted about, obscuring everything beyond the circle of Menzoberranyr and the three remaining members of House Melarn. \"Now is our chance,\" Pharaun said from next to the weapons master. \"Let\u0027s go.\" \"No,\" Quenthel and Halisstra said together. \"Not until she goes down,\" the daughter of Drisinil Melarn added. The Mistress of Arach-Tinilith nodded in agreement and said, \"If she kills him, we\u0027re finishing her.\" Pharaun groaned. \"This is hardly the time for revenge, Mistresses.\" Ssipriina feinted with her mace, and as the gray dwarf twisted out of the way of the attack, the drow palmed a wand and aimed it at her enemy. A thin ray of grayish light shot forth from the tip of the magical device, striking the duergar squarely in the chest. The gray dwarf clutched at his chest and cried out. He dropped to one knee with a groan, and Ssipriina loomed over him. The duergar disappeared. Snarling in rage at this trickery, the matron mother slammed her mace down where her foe had been, but she struck nothing but the pavement. Spinning, she swung back and forth wildly, trying to gain a lucky hit, but she found nothing. The gray dwarf commander appeared again, leaping forward from one side as Ssipriina had turned her back to him. His axe was high, but his war cry gave the drow time to roll away from the worst of the attack. Instead of taking the blade of his weapon full on her skull, it raked across the back of her shoulder with a spurt of crimson. The matron mother cried out, tumbling prone. She rolled to one side as Khorrl lifted his axe for another stroke. As she came around to face him, she fired off another beam with the wand. With a grunt, Khorrl Xornbane dropped his axe and clutched his stomach,then crumpled to the ground, letting out a gurgling death sigh. Quenthel and Halisstra both came at Ssipriina, who was trying to get to her feet, clutching her wounded shoulder with her good hand. Quenthel stepped toone side of the matron mother and struck down with her whip. The fangs of the snakes bit into the drow\u0027s flesh and she screeched in pain, then tried to spin around and aim the wand at the high priestess. Halisstra was ready for that, though, and she swung her mace down hard on Ssipriina\u0027s hand. The crunch of bone was unmistakable. Around them all, the duergar and the drow began to fight again, and Ryld had to duck to avoid a sword swung at him by one of the dark elves. He sank to one knee and reversed Splitter, driving the point of the blade into his opponent\u0027s midsection. The drow threw up blood and sank to his knees, staring down at the sword in his gut. Impassively, Ryld planted his boot on the other drow\u0027s chest and yanked his greatsword free, turning back to see what was happening between the females as the body of his foe collapsed. Quenthel had a hold of Ssipriina\u0027s hair, holding her head up. Both of the matron mother\u0027s arms were injured, and she could barely lift them to protect herself - and the poison was starting to take effect. \"Stop it!\" Quenthel cried, yelling at the combatants around her. \"Stop fighting,now!\" Slowly, the duergar and the drow began to back away, turning to look at Quenthel. \"Enough!\" the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith said, her voice echoing through the haze. \"This is pointless. The city is burning, and we must get out. If you stay here now and try to kill your enemies, you simply bring about your own death. That is not the drow way, and I cannot imagine it is the duergar way, either.\" There were murmurs all around as thedark elves and the gray dwarves eyed each other hatefully, but Ryld saw more than a few shake their heads, agreeing with what Quenthel was saying. \"If you want any chance of living, then go your separate ways and get out of here, before the whole - \" The web street shook violently, tossing everyone about. Ryld, already on one knee, managed to maintain his balance. He peered around uncertainly. The whole length of the calcified webbing was unstable, listing sharply to one side. Ryld knew their time was up, and he began to levitate. Then he spotted what had created the upheaval as a second shock wave made the crumbling pavement shift again. A giant spider had descended from overhead and was scurrying toward them. Behind it, a second spider was also drifting downward, playing out a length of web as it glided down. Damnation, Ryld thought. There\u0027s just no end to this. He peered around, looking for a direction to go to get clear of the approaching beasts. Pharaun appeared beside the weapons master, hovering in the air and eyeing the advancing spiders. \"I think I\u0027ve had quite enough of this,\" the wizard commented dryly, allowinghis dancing rapier to disappear into his ring. Ryld saw Quenthel and Halisstra, still standing over the slowly dying Ssipriina. He pointed them out to Pharaun. \"They don\u0027t know, yet,\" he said, dropping back down. \"We\u0027ve got to warn them!\" Once on his feet, the weapons master carefully managed to hold his balance as he rushed across the intervening space. \"Spiders!\"he shouted as he neared them, pointing. Quenthel looked up and her eyes grew wide. Jeggred appeared out of the haze of smoke next to her, his fur matted with blackening blood. \"We still don\u0027t know where to go,\" Pharaun said, a tinge of despair in his voice as he joined Ryld. \"The best choice for now is simply over the side.\" \"Use your magic,\" Quenthel commanded. \"Get us out ofhere!\" Pharaun spread his hands helplessly. \"Believe me, Mistress,\" he said, \"if I had the means I would be using it. I\u0027ve got nothing left. I can\u0027t conjure a gate just by willing it.\" The first spider loomed closer, and Jeggred advanced toward it, determined to keep himself between the giant arachnid and his mistress. Valas slunk into the group, pulling Danifae along by the hand. The battle captive had a large cut across her forehead, and blood was dripping down into her eyes, making it difficult for her to see. \"Wait!\" Ssipriina said, gasping for air as the poison closed her throat. \"I know . . . of a way out. Save me ... from . . . poison . . .\" \"What?\" Pharaun demanded. \"Where? Get us there!\" \"Say it, wretch,\" Quenthel commanded. \"Dangling . . . Tower,\" the dying matron mother replied, \"Old, unused . . . dormant portal. Poison . . . please . . .\" Ignoring Ssipriina\u0027s pleas, Quenthel turned to Pharaun and asked, \"Could you activate it?\" \"I\u0027ll damn well try,\" Pharaun said. \"Which way?\" \"There . . .\" Ssipriina whispered, looking up. Ryld followed her gaze to a see a large, stalactite-shaped building hanging above them, an inverted tower like many of the estates back in Menzoberranzan. He groaned. \"We don\u0027t have enough time to get there!\" Pharaun cried. \"Why not?\" Q\u0027arlynd Melarn said, floating up into the air to demonstrate. \"We just levitate!\" \"We can\u0027t all do that,\" Pharaun replied desperately, \"As I\u0027ve pointed out a time or two today already, I am fresh out of transportive spells.\" \"The battle captive gets left behind,\" Quenthel said bluntly. \"I\u0027m sorry, but that\u0027s the way it has to be.\" Danifae sank to her knees, her head bowed. She seemed to accept her fate, but Ryld actually felt sorry for the drow. As if to punctuate the lack of time, the stone beneath them shifted again. Ryld left his feet to keep from losing his balance, and everyone else did, too, all except Valas and Danifae. Q\u0027arlynd shook his head. \"I didn\u0027t know,\" he said, shrugging. \"Let\u0027s go.\" \"Wait!\" Halisstra said. \"I can get us all there,\" the priestess volunteered. Pharaun and Quenthel both turned and looked at her. \"You can?\" the wizard asked. \"Yes,\" Halisstra said, nodding. \"I dabble a bit in magic, myself. Different from your style, but some things are the same. Ryld says you\u0027re fond of using those dimensional doorways. I can do that.\" Pharaun motioned for her to hurry. \"Open it into the main gallery,\" Q\u0027arlynd shouted to Halisstra, pointing upward. \"Where I took you that time?\" Another shock wave reverberated through the web street, causing it to buck wildly. Danifae and Valas both went sprawling, nearly being tossed over the side. The first spider was upon them, and Jeggred engaged it in a fight, levitating up to strike at its head. Ryld peered around wildly as the spider reared up and snapped at the draegloth, causing the web street to buck again. The biggest rumble yet whipped through the thoroughfare, and the stone began to shift and crack. \"It\u0027s going to collapse!\" Ryld shouted. \"Priestess, open your doorway!\" Pharaun yelled as another roiling tremor dislodged the side of the street only a few feet away from them. \"We\u0027re going through now!\" \"No!\" screamed Ssipriina, holding the wand she\u0027d used to defeat Khorrl in both of her hands, her feet splayed out beside her, trying to maintain her balance. She mumbled something and aimed the beam at Halisstra. The gray sliver of light struck the priestess in the leg and she buckled over in agony. \"You\u0027re . . . going to ... die with me,\" the crazed matron mother said, turning the wand toward Quenthel. \"No one . . . gets out . . . alive!\" Quenthel couldn\u0027t flee, as she was hovering in the air. She eyed the enraged drow across from her, licking her lips in desperation. \"I think not!\" Halisstra shouted, standing straight again. Before Ssipriina could trigger the wand again, the priestess spun around, swinging her mace with both hands. She struck the matron mother squarely in the face. There was a loud thunderclap, and Ssipriina Zauvirr was driven back a dozen feet, her face a ruined mess of pulpy flesh and bone. \"To the Abyss with you!\" Halisstra screamed at Ssipriina Zauvirr\u0027s lifeless body. Groaning and clutching at her leg, Halisstra wove a spell as the web street tilted again. She was singing, her voice quavering over the roar of battle. Ryld had never heard such a sound. She held a single, perfect note, and a bluish-white doorway opened in the air before her. \"Jeggred! Let\u0027s go!\" Quenthel called, moving toward the doorway. The draegloth dropped his attacks on the spider and scampered backward. When he reached the rest of them, he caught hold of Valas, while Halisstra helped Q\u0027arlynd get a hold of Danifae. Pharaun launched himself through the opening. Ryld followed the wizard to protect him from whatever might be on the other side, stepping through the magical frame just as the street gave way and tumbled into the darkness below him. He hoped the others were right behind him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurrection-war-of-the-spider-queen-2/page-20.html","bookId":2160,"book":{"id":2160,"title":"Insurrection (War of the Spider Queen #2)","description":"Storyline: Insurrection (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
