{"id":97358,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"As he floated up and out of the collapsing building that had at one time been House Melarn, Phataun Mizzrym heard a cry of anguish below him. Looking downward, he spied Halisstra, still emerging from the gaping opening that led into the ruin of her mother\u0027s chambers. She was staring back down into the building.\\n\\n For the rest of his days, the wizard wouldn\u0027t be sure what convinced him to do it, but sensing that someone was still inside, he made up his mind in the blink of an eye to cast a spell. Yanking off his piwafwiand tossing it to Ryld, he uttered a quick arcane phrase and began transforming himself into a loathsome and wretched creature. He had seen the horrid thing several times before and in fact had hunted them for sport a few times in his younger days. As he dropped back down toward the crumbling building, which was beginning to break away from the last of its moorings and drop into the space below, he changed from the handsome drow elf with the winning smile to a winged woman with scaly hindquarters. Though the form was repulsive, it did have one advantage over the wizard\u0027s natural shape: It could fly. Pharaun hoped his harpy shape would be strong enough to lift whoever was still trapped inside.\\n\\n Halisstra seemed about to drop back down into the cavernous room, which was tilted completely on its side, but Pharaun grasped hold of herpiwafwi and shoved her to the side. She looked up at him, startled, and gave a quick shriek of surprise and horror, even as she stumbled back. She fumbled for something tucked inside her ownpiwafwi,and the mage got the impression she had no clue it was him. She was about to attack him.\\n\\n \"Get up with the others!\" he hissed, motioning with one of his clawed hands. \"I\u0027ll go back.\"\\n\\n He saw the flash of a dagger, and Halisstra relaxed the slightest bit, seeming to understand who the harpy really was. He filed away for later the fact that she\u0027d secreted a weapon on her person.\\n\\n Halisstra nodded and pushed herself up from the edge of the hole even as Pharaun folded his wings to his side and stepped over the opening so that he could drop through. Inside, he saw Danifae flailing madly atop a pile of rocks that had once been the ceiling, as the mound of rubble shifted beneath her. At that point, House Melarn was truly falling, and the two of them with it. He noticed that the rubble shifted and ground itself together as the building plummeted downward, grinding itself into oblivion. It almost seemed to be draining out of a hole below her, like some great hourglass. She was struggling to keep from getting sucked down with the stone, but her leg was wedged between two large blocks, and she could not gain a sufficient grip anywhere else in order to pull her limb free.\\n\\n Pharaun sank quickly downto where the battle captive struggled, unfurling his wings at the last moment to slow his descent and come to hover beside the drow female. Danifae responded, reaching out to try to grab hold of the creature before her. Whether she realized it was Pharaun or not, she didn\u0027t seem to care. Pharaun extended his taloned feet in her direction and worked his way to within her reach. She was sinking ever deeper into the debris pit. It was up to her knee, and when it shifted, she arched her head back and screamed more in frustration than in agony.\\n\\n The instant Danifae had a solid grip on him, Pharaun began to thrash with his wings, exerting himself to rise up and out, hoping it would be enough to remove her from her predicament. He felt the resistance - not just of her weight, but also of her trapped leg - but he tugged and flapped, working to free her. Finally, with one last heave, he felt the resistance give, and he was barreling upward, Danifae clinging tightly to his legs. He soared toward the opening as the room continued to drop, and there was a massive roaring crash and a blinding cloud of dust as he shot out through the widening hole.\\n\\n Once free of the room, Pharaun realized he really wasn\u0027t flying upward at all but was hovering in place as the entire structure of House Melarn fell away beneath them. He saw it smash into a web street that stretched across beneath it, and when it struck the thoroughfare a glancing blow, the rubble tumbled around so that it was spinning as it fell. If they\u0027d been a moment longer in freeing themselves, the wizard realized with a shudder, he never would have been able to navigate his way out of the hole. The room would have spun and tumbled with him and Danifae trapped inside.\\n\\n Both of them watched for a moment, awed, as the massive stone structure plummeted downward toward the bottom of the city. Finally, with a sickening boom, it struck somewhere far below, and the concussive impact reverberated all the way up to where they hovered.\\n\\n Pharaun was beginning to feel the strain of trying to fly while holding so much weight. Struggling to see through the thick, choking dust that had been stirred up, he eyed what was left of the web street where House Melarn had been, portions of it still aflame, and saw that chunks of it, too, were giving out. Instead of heading straight up toward that spot, he veered to the side, away from the worst of the damage. Where the calcified webbing broadened into a plaza it was still solid and firm. As he labored in that direction, another major section of the street fell away, following House Melarn to the bottom. What was left was just a ledge jutting out into space.\\n\\n The mage pumped his wings, steering the two of them toward the firmer pavement, past the ledge, which extended perhaps ten feet from the plaza and was twice as wide. When he was over the plaza, he sank down quickly, flapping his wings to force himself to fall off to one side rather than directly on top of Danifae. The drow female dropped right where he\u0027d set her down and sprawled there, drawing deep, ragged breaths. He settled down next to her, none too gently himself, and collapsed. Little points of light swam in his vision as he gasped for breath in the dust-choked air. His limbs were leaden, and he could do nothing but listen to Danifae\u0027s and his own panting.\\n\\n \"That was some rescue effort,\" Ryld said, floating down next to the wizard. \"I don\u0027t know what sort of terror you\u0027re supposed to be, but please don\u0027t ever try to save me looking like that. I\u0027m liable to kill you before I know it\u0027s you.\"\\n\\n Pharaun opened one eye and looked at the warrior as he mentally ended the transformation spell and returned to his own form.\\n\\n \"Certainly not,\" he answered between gasps. \"You, my friend, would just have to extract your worthless carcass from poor Danifae\u0027s predicament yourself, should you ever find it thusly trapped. You haven\u0027t the beauty to warrant rescuing.\"\\n\\n The other members of the group were all settling upon the plaza now, and as Halisstra ascended next to her battle captive attendant, she seemed to crumple, covering her face in her hands, Pharaun supposed he could understand her anguish. After all, her home was sitting at the bottom of the chasm.\\n\\n \"I owe you a very large debt, wizard,\" Danifae said. \"My thanks.\"\\n\\n Pharaun, propped up on his elbows, inclined his head in acknowledgement, still wondering what had possessed him to try the stunt in the first place. He certainly would have felt no regret at seeing the female plunge to her death, but in the end, he supposed, it would have been an awful waste.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure there are ways you and I can find for you to repay me,\" he deadpanned, his face smooth.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Halisstra said, looking up. \"We both owe you. I will make certain we find a suitable reward for you.\"\\n\\n She attempted to offer a genuinely warm smile for Pharaun. The wizard nodded again, intrigued by the suggestiveness of the drow\u0027s offer. He eyed the battle captive again, wondering just how willing she was to serve as recompense for the fact that she was still breathing. The look in her eyes made it clear she was not pleased, but she didn\u0027t voice her displeasure as the Melarn daughter then leaned in to inspect her counterpart in what Pharaun thought was a decidedly affectionate manner. Danifae\u0027s leg looked badly cut and bruised but not too much the worse for wear.\\n\\n Quenthel clicked her tongue in exasperation and said, \"Now that everyone is back from the brink of death, I think it\u0027s time to leave this city. First, though, we must see if we can salvage our other supplies back at the inn.\"\\n\\n The others nodded in agreement.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go quickly,\" Pharaun suggested, aware of the noise of fighting, invisible through the haze but definitely coming closer. \"We don\u0027t want to remain here for any longer than we have to, I think.\"\\n\\n Pharaun stood, dusting himself off and picking up and replacing hispiwafwi from where Ryld had dropped it only moments before. He gazed out across the city, for the first time, really, and the scene took his breath away.\\n\\n \"We may already be too late,\" the wizard breathed, overawed by the devastation he could only partially see, as so much was obscured by a hazy glow, or cloaked with thick smoke. The section of Ched Nasad where House Melarn had been was alive with flames. Recalling that he and Danifae had just escaped perishing in the monumental occurrence, he glanced down to where Halisstra and the other dark elf sat huddled together. Halisstra looked stricken, staring off into the vastness of the city as her attendant huddled close to her and whispered soothing words.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Quenthel concurred. \"This will get worse, much worse. Everyone stay alert. Master Argith, give the two of them their weapons,\" she said, gesturing toward Halisstra and Danifae. \"I think they\u0027ve earned the right to bear them after getting us out of that deathtrap.\"\\n\\n The weapons master pulled a black circle of cloth from a pocket of hispiwafwi, unfolded it, and threw it down upon the stone paving of the plaza. It transformed into a perfectly round hole, large enough for him to reach into. He began rummaging around inside it.\\n\\n \"I think our return to the inn will have to wait for later,\" Valas said, pointing. \"We\u0027re not in the clear yet.\"\\n\\n When Pharaun turned his gaze toward where the scout indicated, he groaned. Scores of gray dwarves were advancing in a line toward them from out of the smoke, faces grim, crossbows and axes brandished. Their front rank had formed a shield wall, while the second row prepared to fire missile weapons. They were mere yards away.\\n\\n \"Look out!\" Halisstra cried, pointing in the opposite direction with the mace Ryld had just handed to her.\\n\\n A host of drow soldiers and priestesses appeared out of the thick smoke, surging forward to meet the duergar head on.\\n\\n When the fiery, smoke-choked estate finally ripped loose from the web street and tumbled into the vast depths of the city below, Aliisza looked on with a mixture of fascination and disappointment. She was certain the wizard was lost to her, yet she marveled at the capacity for destruction the drow displayed. They were tearing apart their own city, with the capable help of several other species. She wondered what any of them hoped to gain from it, but she didn\u0027t really care. She was just sorry she couldn\u0027t enjoy any more flings with the mage.\\n\\n With her consort dead, the alu prepared to make her way out of the city. She had no more cause to be there, and delaying her departure any longer would only place her at risk, however slight. She would rather not have to confront a host of drow or duergar, and she certainly didn\u0027t relish the thought of large amounts of stonework falling on her.\\n\\n Before she could follow through on her intentions to leave, though, Aliisza spied movement a little way down from where the palatial abode had been but moments before. She wasn\u0027t sure, for the air in the vicinity was choked with smoke and dust, but she thought - \\n\\n There. Something was definitely hovering in the air, a wretched creature the fiend knew well enough - a bird-woman known as a harpy - and it had company, a second form gripped in its talons. The pair of them hovered in mid-air, struggling to stay aloft, and the harpy veered up and to the side, bearing its cargo with it.\\n\\n As Aliisza followed the pair\u0027s progress, she caught more movement out of the corner of her eye and realized the harpy and the drow clinging to it were being followed. It was the wizard\u0027s companions.\\n\\n The alu found herself laughing, realizing that Pharaun must be the harpy in a transmuted state, no doubt one of his many spells. He really was an impressive mage, she thought. Somehow, some way, the entire group had managed to free themselves from the building just before it collapsed and vanished into the bottom of the cavern, and along the way, they had picked up two additional members.\\n\\n Aliisza moved cautiously closer, wanting to get a better look without being seen, and when she did, her eyes narrowed. That wretch Pharaun had rescued some tart, a beautiful drow who, despite her current disheveled look, was obviously a lovely catch for the wizard. Even as she watched, the mage transformed back into his natural form, collapsing beside the female, giving her the eye even as he caught his breath.\\n\\n Aliisza was furious, watching the mage ogle the drow. She would tear that trollop\u0027s eyes out herself! She would - !\\n\\n Shaking with anger, she prepared to swoop in and make good on her silent threats, but the rest of the group settled around the pair. Clenching her fists in fury, Aliisza restrained herself, but she wanted to know what was going on. Quickly, she cast a spell and began to magically eavesdrop on their conversation.\\n\\n - must see if we can salvage our other supplies back at the inn.\\n\\n Then let\u0027s go quickly,she heard Pharaun say.We don\u0027t want to remain here for any longer than we have to, I think.\\n\\n Grinning, Aliisza ended the spell and flew off, still careful to avoid drawing attention. She had an idea forming, and she was pleased with herself for thinking of it.\\n\\n \"Get off this street!\" Ryld urged, pointing to a smaller thoroughfare that ran past a temple off to one side where they might avoid the worst of the clash. \"Hurry!\" the warrior commanded, sprinting toward the side street.\\n\\n Pharaun heard the call of his friend and tried to turn and scramble toward the side street that Ryld had indicated, but the wizard wasn\u0027t quite fast enough to avoid the press of drow streaming past him. Instead, he was buffeted along for several feet in the opposite direction before he finally managed to slip off to the side, taking refuge against a set of large stone stairs leading up to some immense public building. A moment later, Danifae staggered alongside him, dropping to her knees and panting for breath.\\n\\n \"Where are the others?\" the wizard asked her, admiring her curves even as the battle raged around them.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know,\" she gasped. \"Were. . . right behind me.\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t stay here,\" Pharaun told her.\\n\\n He began to look around for a better vantage point upon which to watch for his companions without being in the midst of the fighting.\\n\\n The battle was raging in the plaza where Pharaun and the others had become separated. A duergar stepped up to the pair of them, smiled maliciously, and raised a spiked warhammer to strike at the mage. Danifae was too quick, though, jerking her morning star around and into the gray dwarf\u0027s midsection. The stout creature gasped as the wind was knocked out of him, and Pharaun took advantage of the delay to cast a spell. A wide but thin fan of flame sprang from the wizard\u0027s fingertips and caught the humanoid squarely across the face. The duergar shrieked and staggered backward, flailing at his burning beard. Others in the crowd shifted and moved to avoid coming into contact with the blazing creature, and finally the duergar fell off-balance andcollapsed, unmoving, to the paved street.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" Pharaun insisted, taking Danifae by the hand and leading her, still limping from her ordeal back in the collapsing House, up the stairs to the top of the landing.\\n\\n A pair of gray dwarves started to follow the two of them then stopped about halfway up, aiming loaded crossbows. Pharaun spun away and yanked hispiwafwi\u0027shood around him, using the cloak to shield both himself and Danifae. Two bolts smacked into the center of his back, giving him a vicious sting.\\n\\n He cried out from the pain, sinking down to one knee. Angrily freeing his magical rapier, Pharaun turned back to face the pair of duergar, mentally directing the dancing weapon toward them. The wizard managed to engage the first gray dwarf, but the second one scrambled past the enchanted weapon and clambered up the steps toward him.\\n\\n A blur of fur and claws landed on the steps between the mage and his foe, and Jeggred sliced and gashed at the duergar, spraying gouts of blood in every direction. The humanoid staggered back from the draegloth\u0027s onslaught, his arms held up defensively as he was cut down. When the first gray dwarf saw the fate of his companion, he backed down the steps and fled into the swirling maelstrom of skirmishing below.\\n\\n \"Stay here,\" Jeggred said, bounding back down into the crowd. \"I will get the others.\"\\n\\n Pharaun considered whether to obey the draegloth or ignore the beast. He would be much happier, he decided, if he could get up on top of the building, but he knew that Danifae was unable to follow him, should he choose to levitate there. He decided to await the return of Quenthel\u0027s pet.\\n\\n \"Back in here,\" he said to Danifae, stepping into the deeper darkness of the entryway and pulling her in after him.\\n\\n From there, they could watch the street below without being so exposed.\\n\\n Danifae pressed against Pharaun, trying to remain out of sight, but the effect was very distracting. The mage found himself pressing right back, while at the same time wondering how he could be so easily diverted during such a time.\\n\\n It\u0027s not like you\u0027ve never enjoyed the feel of the flesh before, he chided himself.\\n\\n Still, he was glad that she lingered there, though whether her contact with him was purely happenstance or calculated, he wasn\u0027t sure.\\n\\n The two of them did not have to wait long. Jeggred reappeared after a couple of moments, with Quenthel right behind him. Jeggred cut a swath through the crowd with his oversized claws, while the drow protected the fiend\u0027s back. As the duo forced their way through the throng more than a few fell before the draegloth\u0027s fierce strikes. Finally, they reached the stairs and hurried up to the landing.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re here,\" Pharaun said, gesturing for Quenthel and Jeggred to join him. \"We\u0027ve got to get to the roof,\" he said, pointing over their head, \"We can see much better from up there, and stay out of the fray.\"\\n\\n Jeggred nodded and grabbed Danifae. Together, they began to levitate upward, reaching a spot on the roof that overlooked the sea of clashing bodies below. Pharaun and Quenthel followed quickly. The four of them settled down atop the rounded surface and dropped low, wanting to avoid creating too large a profile against the backdrop of the city. Pharaun did a careful inspection of the city streets one levelup, trying to ascertain whether or not they\u0027d been noticed from there. It appeared that they had not.\\n\\n \"Do you see them?\" Quenthel asked no one in particular, and Pharaun returned his attention to the scene below.\\n\\n The battle still raged, but it was beginning to thin somewhat as the body count grew.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" the Master of Sorcere replied, and Danifae also shook her head.\\n\\n \"The warrior went running that way,\" the battle captive said, pointing toward a side street on the opposite side of the square. \"I think Halisstra followed him.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I heard him,\" Pharaun replied. \"I tried to get there, but the surge was too much. When the fighting dies down, we can try to reach them.\"\\n\\n \"What about Valas?\" Quenthel said. \"What happened to him?\"\\n\\n Pharaun replied, \"I don\u0027t know, but he can disappear even when you\u0027re looking right at him, so I don\u0027t think he\u0027s in much danger. He\u0027ll show up when we need him most.\"\\n\\n By this time, the duergar were beginning to overwhelm the force of dark elves, and when reinforcements for the gray dwarves arrived, what was left of the drow turned and fled. Pharaun watched, hoping the throng of duergar would give chase, but they seemed content to hold up and regroup.\\n\\n That\u0027s when everything went wrong.\\n\\n Five or six crossbow bolts snapped against the roof next to the wizard, and a couple of them actually struck him in the back. Only the enchantments of hispiwafwiprotected him, but he was getting damned tired of being hit. Danifae was not so lucky. One of the bolts speared her through the calf, and she growled in pain as Pharaun leaped up to shield her with his own body.\\n\\n A burst of flame and light exploded only a few feet to the wizard\u0027s right. Fire swept over the surface of the roof where they crouched as a second and a third burst landed near the first. The wizard flinched, then turned to see where the new attack was coming from. What he saw made his heart sink. The attackers, whom Pharaun could see were more gray dwarves, were perched atop a web street one level above them and near the back line of the roof. They hurled more firepots in the drow\u0027s direction, and Jeggred roared in anger, hit by one of the incendiary pots.\\n\\n \"Damn it, Pharaun, you\u0027ve led us into a crossfire!\" Quenthel snarled at the mage. \"We\u0027ve got to get off this roof. Jeggred, shield me.\"\\n\\n Quenthel turned to peer over the side, and Jeggred positioned himself to shield the three drow with his body as best he could. Part of his fur was smoking, but the draegloth didn\u0027t seem to notice.\\n\\n \"We can not stand here,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I know,\" Pharaun responded, examining the bolt wound in Danifae\u0027s leg more carefully.\\n\\n It had struck the same leg that was already injured but didn\u0027t appear bad, having missed the bone and penetrated only the fleshy part of her calf. He snapped off what he could, and the battle captive gave a slight jerk.\\n\\n Quenthel made a disgusted sound, pulling back from the edge.\\n\\n \"All of this commotion has attracted their attention below us,\" Quenthel said in a harsh tone. \"We can\u0027t go that way.\"\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027ll go over the other side,\" the wizard replied.\\n\\n He shoved what was left of the bolt through Danifae\u0027s leg and out. She hissed from the sudden pain, but bit her lip and stifled any more sounds. More crossbow bolts and firepots were smacking down against the stone around them.\\n\\n \"Is it poisoned?\" Pharaun asked the high priestess.\\n\\n In answer, one of the viper heads on Quenthel\u0027s whip rose up and hissed, \"No.\"\\n\\n More of the firepots slammed down nearby, adding to the roar of the fire, which washot and spreading across the rock surface of the building.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll be roasted rothemeat in a moment,\" the mage said. \"Heal her so we can go!\"\\n\\n \"Forget her,\" Quenthel replied. \"Come on.\"\\n\\n The Mistress of the Academy stood and moved toward the back of the building, still skulking behind the draegloth.\\n\\n Pharaun looked back down at Danifae, shrugged, and began to stand. The female reached up and grabbed him by thepiwafwi,a determined look on her face.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t leave me here,\" she said. \"I can walk. Just help me up.\"\\n\\n Another pair of explosions erupted near her head, and she flinched forward as Pharaun took hold of her by the hand and hauled her to her feet.\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t regret it,\" she said, giving the wizard a brief but obvious look. \"It\u0027ll be worth it.\"\\n\\n Limping, blood flowing from the puncture, Danifae began to follow Quenthel and the draegloth.\\n\\n \"Jeggred!\" she called. \"Carry me!\"\\n\\n Pharaun realized his mouth was hanging open, and he snapped it shut. As he trotted after the battle captive, he saw Quenthel and the draegloth freeze, and he swept his gaze to where they were looking, at the back side of the building. Rising up from behind the roofline was an immense, chitinous leg of something all too familiar. The leg sought footing upon the rooftop, and two more appeared, followed, by the head of a spider of massive size.\\n\\n \"Lolth preserve us,\" Quenthel breathed. \"Where did that come from?\"\\n\\n The immense spider pulled itself into full view, scrambling ponderously over the back edge of the building, each step making the entire structure shake violently.\\n\\n \"Oh, no,\" Danifae said. \"They didn\u0027t. . .\"\\n\\n \"They, who?\" Pharaun asked, involuntarily backing up a step.\\n\\n Even Jeggred seemed anxious, watching the enormous arachnid, black and shiny, heave itself fully atop the building. Its mandibles clicked as it peered about, its multilensed eyes glistening in the firelight.\\n\\n \"And what didthey do?\" the wizard added.\\n\\n \"The matron mothers,\" Danifae replied. \"They summoned a guardian spider. The fools.\"\\n\\n Quenthel sucked in her breath.\\n\\n \"Indeed,\" the high priestess agreed. \"We must flee.\"\\n\\n Pharaun wanted to ask the two females what in the Abyss a guardian spider was, but at that moment, the arachnid spotted them, though they had remained quite still. It leaned forward eagerly, coming after them.\\n\\n As one, they turned and fled over the side.\\n\\n As she reached the alley, following Ryld Argith, Halisstra turned to see who had caught up with her in the chaos of the swarming, fighting drow and duergar. Of the others, there was no sign.\\n\\n \"Come on!\" Ryld shouted from up ahead, motioning frenetically for Halisstra to keep up with him.\\n\\n Several duergar had followed them into the alley that ran alongside the temple and were closing in on her. She turned back for a moment, thinking to make a stand and drive them away, but a crossbow bolt snapped against the stone wall near the priestess, shattering and showering her with splinters. She turned again and ran, the gray dwarves pounding along after her.\\n\\n As Halisstra caught up to Ryld, he fired his own crossbow once, to slow down the pursuit, and they sprinted along the alley together, weaving through the turns of the pathway, trying to lose their foes. The two of them turned one last corner and skidded to a stop. The alleyway ended at a solid wall, though one side was low, protecting some sort of covered porch.\\n\\n \"Damn,\" Ryld muttered, slipping his greatsword free. He turned back to prepare to face the oncoming gray dwarves. \"Get ready,\" he told her, and Halisstra planted herself beside the warrior, her heavy mace feeling good in her hand.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t we just float up there?\" she asked, pointing to the roofline as the first two duergar appeared.\\n\\n The first of the gray dwarves wielded a wicked-looking, double-bladed axe, while the second had a heavy hammer that was easily twice the size of Halisstra\u0027s own mace. She readjusted the grip on her shield as the hammer-wielding dwarf advanced, hate gleaming in his eyes.\\n\\n Ryld risked a quick glance upward before he stepped gracefully to the side, avoiding the first cut of the double-bladed axe and making a quick, neat cut of his own that the gray dwarf barely managed to parry.\\n\\n \"Only if we have to,\" the warrior replied. \"No sense making ourselves a target for their crossbows.\"\\n\\n Halisstra could see that though the duergar\u0027s weapon was larger, the creature was forced to put a lot behind each swing, while Ryld was able to sidestep and redirect his own weapon far more easily. Then the priestess was too busy thwarting her own attacker\u0027s strikes to watch the weapons master.\\n\\n The first blow came low, aimed at her knees, and she dipped the shield down enough so that the hammer grazed it, scraping across as she spun back and out of the way to avoid taking the full brunt of the strike. The dwarf followed this with an uppercut swing, which Halisstra was forced to block with her weapon, again redirecting the hammer rather than trying to completely stop the swing. She brought her mace back around and waited, thinking to let her enemy tire himself by repeatedly over-swinging.\\n\\n That was all good in theory, Halisstra realized, but when three more duergar appeared, she knew that she and Ryld had been cornered. This time, when the dwarf over-swung and she deflected the blow with her shield, she also kicked out, catching the gray dwarf with her boot in the side of his knee. The humanoid grunted and staggered backward a couple of steps, but another dwarf was there, ready to step into the fray. Halisstra moved to position herself next to Ryld again, working so that each of them could protect the other\u0027s flank, preventing the gray dwarves from getting inside their position.\\n\\n Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Ryld, still battling with the gray dwarves. One of the humanoids lay dead at his feet, while another had a bloody gash across his thigh. Behind them, two more had appeared, and these had crossbows, which they brought to bear, waiting for openings to shoot at the two drow.\\n\\n One of the duergar nudged his companion and pointed to the priestess. Together, they swung their crossbows around to put her in their sights, and Halisstra took refuge behind her shield. She felt one bolt strike her shield, but the other embedded itself in her shoulder. She grunted in pain and staggered backward, unable tokeep her shield raised high enough for solid protection.\\n\\n Another gray dwarf circled to Halisstra\u0027s shield side, seeing that her defenses were down, and brought his axe high for a new strike. She did her best to spin and face the duergar without exposing Ryld\u0027s flank, and she managed to parry the blow with her mace, but the crushing force of it made her stumble to one knee.\\n\\n \"Ryld! Help me!\" she cried out, and as though sensing she was in trouble, the warrior was in front of her, battling all four of the foes at once.\\n\\n The priestess risked a glance over at the gray dwarves who were reloading their crossbows. They were also pointing at her and grinning. Or rather, they were pointing over her head, Halisstra realized.\\n\\n The priestess\u0027s heart sank as she took a peek above. More of the gray dwarves had already taken the roof, and these had thrown nets across the opening while she and Ryld had been engaged in the battle. They were trapped inside the alley, unable to escape. The duergar on the roofs also had crossbows, and as one of them fired at her, Halisstra flinched. The crossbow boltwhisked across her face, grazing her cheek. She felt wetness.\\n\\n \"Ryld!\" she cried out as she stumbled to her feet again. \"They\u0027re above us, too. We\u0027re trapped.\"\\n\\n The warrior never acknowledged Halisstra\u0027s cry, so busy was he fending off four duergar. Slowly, he was being forced back, bloody gashes across his body, having to retreat a little at a time to keep the gray dwarves from surrounding him.\\n\\n Gritting her teeth, Halisstra tested the end of the crossbow bolt that protruded from her arm and almost wretched from the pain that doing so produced. Her shield arm useless, the priestess rose to her feet anyway, gripping her mace and moving next to the warrior once more. She tried to stay beside him, to guard his flank and enjoy a similar protection.\\n\\n One of the four gray dwarves was dead, but Ryld was breathing heavily. A duergar slipped around to Halisstra\u0027s side, trying to get inside her defenses. She swung her mace hard and caught the duergar closing in on her on the shoulder, feeling the satisfying crunch of metal on bone. The gray dwarf growled in anguish as he dropped his axe and fell back out of Ryld\u0027s reach.\\n\\n Two more stepped in to take the wounded one\u0027s place, and Halisstra had to press in too closely to Ryld to avoid being struck down. Her movement hampered the weapons master\u0027s ability to fight, and he took a cut across his forearm as a result.\\n\\n \"By the Dark Mother,\" Ryld snarled, whipping Splitter around to cleave the offending gray dwarf\u0027s head completely off.\\n\\n The body flopped to the ground as the head rolled away, past another duergar, who watched it pass him with a look of horror on his face.\\n\\n Another crossbow bolt clacked against the stone of the street near Halisstra, and two more struck her armor, bouncing off. Ryld jerked as a bolt flew close to him, but he never turned his attention away from his adversaries, never deviated from his fluid motion and quick, precise strikes. Still, he and Halisstra were being backed into a corner, the priestess saw, and they would make easy prey for the snipers on the roof.\\n\\n The first firepot exploded right behind Halisstra, making her jump and nearly get her head taken off by an axe. She scrambled away from the flames as she warded off another blow from the axe-wielding enemy in front of her with her mace, feeling the vibration of the blow all the way up her arm. Two more of the flaming contraptions smacked against the end of the street, the clay pots shattering and spilling fire everywhere. She risked a glance up and saw another one hurtling toward her. Somehow, her wounded shoulder screaming in agony, she managed to bring her shield up with both hands and deflected the pot so that it skipped off and hit the pavement between her and her opponent.\\n\\n The gray dwarves fighting with them began backing up, and Halisstra saw that the duergar on the roof were creating a fire screen to seal her and Ryld off, trap them between the flames and the wall. She knew that they intended to pin the two drow down, and pick them off at their leisure. There was nowhere for the dark elves to go. They were going to die. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurrection-war-of-the-spider-queen-2/page-16.html","bookId":2160,"book":{"id":2160,"title":"Insurrection (War of the Spider Queen #2)","description":"Storyline: Insurrection (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
