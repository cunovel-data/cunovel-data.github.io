{"id":97353,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Khorrl Xornbane knew that his fidgeting was a bad sign, but he couldn\u0027t help it. He and his clan had been hiding and waiting for so long he could hardly stand it any longer. Hiding several thousand duergar was never easy, but trying to do it in the middle of a city full of drow was taking its toll on his nerves. He was thankful that the waiting was almost over. Until then, the fighting had been relatively easy and pain-free. Ambushing the matron mother and her retinue in the storehouse had been almost too simple. She obviously trusted the other matron mother far too much, and it had cost her. He wondered if anyone had discovered the bodies of her soldiers and advisors. They would, soon, he knew. The smell would lead someone to them. Khorrl and his duergar were inside the manor itself, out of sight in an unused wing of the place, in a barracks where no soldiers were currently quartered. It was driving Khorrl mad. His sentries had not reported anyone even coming near the halls where he and his boys waited, but if anyone found them, the plan was ruined. \"Captain.\" An all-too-familiar voice came from the shadows at the edges of the storehouse. Khorrl felt his heart begin to race with anticipation. Zammzt stepped from the shadows, a wry smile on his face. \"So?\" the duergar asked. \"We\u0027ve gotten the word,\" Zammzt replied. \"It\u0027s time for you to go to work.\" Khorrl rubbed his hands together in delight. At last. He began going over the plan in his head once more as he issued orders, and Zammzt faded back into the shadow from which he\u0027d emerged. The real fighting was about to begin. Faeryl was fast growing bored with all of it. She wished the matron mothers would simply see things as her mother had laid them out so carefully, declare House Melarn treasonous and dissolved, and permit House Zauvirr to rise to a position of prominence so that Ssipriina could sit on the Council. But of course, there was the prerequisite squabbling that had to take place, first. Faeryl supposed she would care a whole lot more if she stood to gain more, but her mother would still be ordering her around - and getting ordered around in turn, even if it was by someone other than Drisinil Melarn. There\u0027s always someone using you as their footstool, Faeryl thought, no matter how high you reach. Even Triel Baenre was forced to nod her head in subservience to the whims of Lolth, and it\u0027s possible that the Dark Mother herself has been forced to - \"Faeryl, stop wasting our time with your idle fancies, and pay attention,\" Ssipriina Zauvirr said, snapping Faeryl out of her thoughts. \"Sorry, Mother,\" the younger drow answered, chagrined. She focused her attention on the conversation at hand, for at least the matron mothers were no longer talking as one. \"Isaid,\" Inidil Mylyl declared, emphasizing the word to make sure everyone in the room understood that she was put out at having to repeat herself, \"that hearing the tale in its entirety once more would go a long way toward clarifying just exactly how this managed to happen right under our noses. Perhaps Faeryl can indulge us for a few moments more to explain this.\" Faeryl groaned inwardly. She had already explained herself three times to the first matron mothers to arrive. They had not been happy with several parts of her story, so she was going to have to tell the whole thing once more for those matron mothers who had chosen, for whatever reason, to arrive late. Of course, they were the most powerful drow in Ched Nasad, used to keeping others waiting and daring anyone to question them on it. She felt queasy as she crossed to the center of the room. \"Yes, of course, Matron Mother Mylyl,\" she said as politely as she could. Compared to the collection of nobility in the room, House Zauvirr was still inconsequential and could be held accountable for everything Faeryl had done and said up to that point. Embarrassing one\u0027s own mother in front of her superiors was no way to climb to a higher position within a House, and the ambassador knew that both her tone and her explanation had to be handled just right. \"For the sake of understanding,\" she continued, \"let me start by saying that House Zauvirr represents House Melarn in certain business interests, and I represent House Zauvirr\u0027s efforts on behalf of House Melarn in Menzoberranzan. I serve - or did serve, rather - as the ambassador to Triel Baenre herself. When the difficulties arose, they were, as you now know, experienced in Menzoberranzan as well. Concerned about this and the lack of caravan traffic between the two cities, I petitioned Matron Mother Baenre to allow me to return here in the hopes of finding out what was wrong. \"Triel refused, and in fact, effectively placed me under house arrest, for what concerns I never found out. She eventually imprisoned me when I tried to leave on my own. While I did not wish to damage the relationship between our Houses and House Baenre, my loyalty and concern lay solely with my own family and those families we serve here in Ched Nasad. I was ordered put to death for treason, but thankfully, the execution never occurred. \"Triel changed her mind at some point, choosing instead to forgive me whatever sins I supposedly committed. She assigned me to journey with her sister, Quenthel Baenre, and several others here to Ched Nasad to reestablish trading and to determine if more information was available concerning the, uh . . .\" \"Child, we all know that Lolth has vanished. You don\u0027t have to tread around the subject.\" It was Matron Mother Aunrae Nasadra, the uncrowned queen of Ched Nasad, leader of the most powerful House in the city. Faeryl swallowed as Aunrae added, \"Get to the point.\" The ambassador nodded and continued. \"Menzoberranzan had suffered an uprising, a slave revolt supported by outside forces. Containing it consumed a substantial amount of the sisterhood\u0027s divine resources. Matron Mother Triel sent the group of us here to find out if Lolth\u0027s disappearance was limited to Menzoberranzan or felt across all tribes of drow, but she also wanted Quenthel to procure any divine magic she could lay her hands on here. Quenthel and Triel had apparently rationalized that since House Baenre held part ownership in Black Claw Mercantile, anything the storehouses stocked was her city\u0027s by right. Once I was able to covertly relay this to my mother via my brother and his magical contacts, we worked together to set a trap and catch the Menzoberranyr in the act. It was only when we all arrived at the storehouse that we discovered Matron Mother Melarn was actually aiding the visitors. My mother confronted both of them together, and Matron Mother Melarn tried to escape.\" When she finished, Faeryl realized she was out of breath from rushing through the rest of her explanation. Matron Mother Aunrae had that effect on everyone. \"Drisinil was killed, cut down trying to flee,\" Ssipriina added, drawing attention back to herself. \"I would have done whatever I could to spare her if I could have reached her in time, but it was too late, and my own magic is too weakened to stave off the passing.\" \"So you conspired to allow them to sneak into the city, going so far as to mislead a city patrol?\" The matron mother who asked this question was Jyslin Aleanrahel. Her features were sharp, almost fierce, and her reputation as a malicious, greedy drow who found fault in every action was legendary. Faeryl had never liked her, but she was hardly in a position to show that sentiment. \"They have no doubt been sent to spy on us,\" Jyslin continued, \"and their supposed story of reestablishing contact here was simply a falsehood meant to keep you off-balance. I daresay the males still loose in the city are sending sensitive information back to their superiors even now, especially if this wizard is as capable as you alleged before. I might have expected you to be a more clever girl and keep them out of the city, but I suppose that\u0027s too much to ask.\" \"This is foolish,\" Umrae D\u0027Dgttu, matron mother of the second most powerful House in the city said. \"We\u0027ve heard the story, some of us several times now. It is clear to me that House Zauvirr acted with the best intentions of Ched Nasad in mind. I move that we dissolve House Melarn forthwith.\" Umrae was one of Ssipriina\u0027s secret allies, Faeryl knew. This was it. They were beginning the process, giving her mother what she wanted. Dissolution of House Melarn was the first step in granting Ssipriina a seat on the Council. \"I concur,\" said Ulviirala Rilynt, another of the four her mother had bribed. \"The treason of House Melarn seems clear enough to me.\" Faeryl stole a glance at Ssipriina and saw that she was trying hard not to smile too broadly. \"I\u0027m more concerned with the veracity of their story,\" Lirdnolu Maerret said. \"So far, all we\u0027ve had to go on is this fanciful tale Ssipriina and her daughter have woven, with no neutral observer able to substantiate it. House Zauvirr stands to gain quite a lot by seeing Drisinil and her ilk dead. I for one am unwilling to so quickly assume they\u0027re telling the truth simply for the good of the city.\" \"Quite true,\" Jyslin Aleanrahel agreed. \"Let\u0027s hear Drisinil\u0027s daughter speak.\" Faeryl opened her mouth to protest then snapped it shut again. The matron mothers knew well the propensity drow had for scheming, and this was the challenge Ssipriina had cautioned her would come. There were some who would want the whole truth and would look to try to trap House Zauvirr in a lie, or if they were allies of House Melarn, try to pin whatever blame they could on Ssipriina. Her mother had cautioned Faeryl for patience during this time. When their new enemies were exposed, or if the decision didn\u0027t favor Zauvirr, their secret mercenary army would step forward. Halisstra Melarn was brought from the dungeons below to answer for her mother\u0027s crimes. She was almost forcibly led into the chamber, flanked by two large female guards. She had been stripped of her fine clothing and was dressed in only a thin shift. She cast her eyes about the room, searching faces, perhaps hoping to find some sympathy or support among those present. It was rumored that Halisstra had a soft streak, that she never seemed to show the type of tenacious ambition her mother wanted to see in her daughters. She was more interested, those rumors suggested, in slumming with her battle captive, Danifae, using the other drow\u0027s good looks to attract males to carouse with. There were even some who whispered that Matron Mother Melarn would have cast her out of the family, given the right circumstances. Faeryl knew that the slumming part was true, and that gave her an idea. She spread her hands helplessly, as if acknowledging that she had failed in some way. \"I beg your forgiveness for whatever flaws you see in our plan, Matron Mothers,\" Faeryl said quietly. \"I am as disappointed as you that a House of our own beloved city would conspire with foreigners at our expense. I now recall additional damning evidence that might put this debate to rest.\" \"What?\" Ssipriina said, leaning forward, obviously loath to see her daughter possibly ruin her own carefully laid web of lies. Faeryl studiously ignored her mother. \"What do you mean?\" Jyslin said, her eyes narrowing. Faeryl was sure she had the advantage. Though she had not mentioned it before - since it was a lie she had only conceived of on the spur of the moment - there was no way Jyslin could challenge her for leaving it out of her story the first time. Faeryl could pretend she\u0027d simply forgotten it until then. \"It\u0027s just that, right after passing through the gates of the city, I had the good fortune to spy Mistress Halisstra and her consort, Danifae Yauntyrr. I was surprised to see them in such a sordid section of the city, but I considered it a stroke of good fortune, nonetheless. I made a specific effort to move into their line of sight so that they would see it was me and notice I was with strangers. I thought for certain they had spotted me, and I even flashed a quick message to Danifae, but she either didn\u0027t recognize me or didn\u0027t want anyone to know they\u0027d been there. She turned Halisstra away, and the two of them melted into the crowd. At the time, I didn\u0027t think anything of it, but now I realize that she must have been there to signal Quenthel and the others.\" Hahsstra\u0027s eyes grew wide at hearing Faeryl\u0027s accusations. She sputtered to find the words to defend herself. \"I ... we never . . . Matron Mothers, I assure you that we never saw the ambassador and her companions in the lower sections of the city. I am innocent of the charges leveled against me.\" Faeryl smiled to herself. Halisstra had specifically avoided denying that she had been there. It had been a gamble, supposing that the two of them might have been in the vicinity in the last couple of days, but it had paid off. The unwanted attention was being focused on Halisstra. \"Perhaps I am mistaken,\" Faeryl quickly interjected. She smiled at Halisstra, who was staring daggers at her in return. \"It was crowded there, with all of the refugees and the base-born males in their revelry, so its easy to understand how I only thought Danifae had caught the eye of someone in my party. The two of you were obviously seeking someone else.\" Faeryl wanted to grin at her own cleverness. By pulling back, admitting she had made a mistake, she doubly damned Halisstra. The seed of doubt had been planted in everyone\u0027s mind, and the less she tried to force them to accept her theory, the more likelythey all would be to believe it; such was drow nature. For those who chose to believe Halisstras innocence, that left only one other reason for her to be in such an improper part of the city. Either way, it shed an unpleasant light on the daughter of a traitor. Ssipriina turned to Jyslin Aleanrahel and said, \"Matron Mother, I am only a trader, unused to the machinations of the higher nobility. If I had foreseen how greatly this would have displeased you, I would have conceived of a better way to deal with the crisis at hand. As it was, I still hope you will consider that I was keeping only the best interests of Ched Nasad in mind, acting in all ways on its behalf.\" There was a general murmur from the matron mothers as they put their heads together, no doubt discussing the additional implications of guilt Faeryl\u0027s little tale had just heaped upon House Melarn. At the very least, the suggestion that Halisstra had been carousing with the commoners of the city meant that her disgraceful behavior was of the worst sort and she was unfit to rule a noble House. That half of it happened to be true only made the whole incident sweeter to Faeryl, who was simply glad she was no longer the drow everyone else was looking down their noses at. \"Enough!\" Aunrae Nasadra shouted, rapping her rune-covered staff upon the floor. Even in such an impromptu meeting, the eldest and most powerful matron mother commanded absolute respect, and the room fell silent. \"This nonsense is the reason we face the bleak loss of our goddess\u0027s favor. How can we expect Lolth to grant us her attention when we waste so much time and energy onsuch ridiculous discussions as who\u0027s stepped in the most rothemuck?\" The matriarch walked among the others, peering at them all. \"Whether or not House Melarn\u0027s progeny chooses to whore around with low-born males in the seamiest underbelly of Ched Nasad is of no concern to me.\" Faeryl stole a glance at Halisstra, whose face was down in humiliation. Matron Mother Nasadra paid neither of them any heed. \"The streets are not safe for most drow,\" she said. \"We all know the extra precautions we had to take even to come here. Our city is on the verge of disaster, mothers, and yet we must stand here and discuss the fate of a noble House, one high enough to have a seat on the Council. \"Ssipriina has suggested that we dissolve House Melarn and offer up Halisstra and these remaining outsiders as sacrifices to appease the masses as much as the Dark Mother. While we know nothing about why our beloved Lolth is angry with us, that sheis angry with us, we are certain. Will this help? Will it bring her blessings back to us? \"If we make an example of the traitors and let the whole city see us do it will it quiet the citizens for a time? Perhaps, but more importantly, will it satisfy all of you? Will you return to your Houses satisfied that a House has fallen and that the hierarchy has shuffled sufficiently? There are things more fragile than the peace of our city, but they are few in number. This backstabbing, while inherent in our nature, is misplaced during this time of difficulties.\" \"What if this Baenre priestess\u0027s companions know something?\" Halisstra asked. \"What if they have an inkling of what troubles the Dark Mother? If you simply kill me, then you get what you want - one less House to stand in your way - but if you kill them, whether as spies or as sacrifices, you might lose valuable information.\" \"Shut your mouth, child!\" Ssipriina hissed. \"You\u0027ve shamed us enough for one lifetime. Do not think that you can escape justice merely by pretending to be loyal now. It\u0027s too late for that.\" Halisstra would not be deterred. She proceeded, ignoring the dark stares the matron mothers gave her. \"What if this wizard has discovered something?\" she asked. \"Faeryl has already told us he is clever and was not above antagonizing Quenthel. I would not put it past him to know more than he\u0027s letting on. Why kill him, when he might be so inclined to parlay with us? Could he be willing to reveal his own secrets? Perhaps even for a price? There are those among you who do not wish to hear what he has to say. He might expose the lies you have told concerning my mother and me.\" Aunrae smiled and said, \"Tell me, child, do you think Lolth would grant such a vision to a male? Do you think she would allow aboy, however clever, to unlock the secrets of her silence?\" \"These are desperate times, Matron Mother, you said so yourself. I would not close any possible avenue of redemption, however thickly cloaked in folly it may seem. Of course, I have few avenues of redemption for my life left. I have my own desperate times. Whether you wish to question him or not, I merely ask that you bring him as a witness into these proceedings. His words could prove my own innocence.\" Faeryl frowned, not liking where this was leading. She was beginning to think it had been a mistake to put the full plan into motion until Pharaun and the others had also been brought into custody, or better yet, killed. Maybe she could get to him before the rest of them had a chance to speak with him, take care of it herself, one way or another. Perhaps then her mother would stop treating her like a child. Aunrae nodded, her mouth pursed as though considering the younger drows words. \"You argue for your life, Halisstra Melarn, but still your pleas have some merit. We will wait to pass sentence on you until we\u0027ve had a chance to hear all sides. As for the \u0027clever boy,\u0027 when he comes to us, when we have him in our possession, we will extract whatever information he has, fully and without paying any price. Somehow, I do not think Quenthel Baenre had established the proper leashes on her wizard. I do not intend to make the same mistake.\" \"Matron Mother Nasadra,\" Zammzt called from the back of the room, where he had just entered. \"They are here.\" Pharaun, Ryld, and Valas had been led inside and shown to a waiting room, an all-too-familiar sight to each of them and one that did nothing to set their minds at ease. They were left alone, or rather with only sentries posted at each of the exits to keep them company. Pharaun occupied his time strolling through the chamber, admiring the frescos and statuary that were in abundance there, primarily exhibiting the motif of spiders, webbing, and the glory of the dark elves. There were a goodly number of musical instruments as well, some he didn\u0027t even recognize. The Master of Sorcere supposed a good many of the works related to the history of House Melarn, but to Pharaun it was all just so much pomp and circumstance. Ryld and Valas, meanwhile, had their heads together in consultation, most likely discussing tactics for extricating themselves in the event that things went bad. When the double doors at the far end of the room were thrown open, Pharaun turned to see not one but several ostentatious drow females - matriarchs all, he was sure - waiting in the large audience chamber beyond. They were attended by a retinue of House wizards, soldiers, and younger females, all of them in House livery and many of them, Pharaun noted, radiating magical protections and other spells. \"Good evening, and welcome to House Melarn,\" one somewhat tall and slender drow said imperiously, waiting on the throne as the three males moved into the room. \"I am Matron Mother Ssipriina Zauvirr.\" Pharaun bowed slightly as he moved to a place in front of the throne, far enough back so as not to seem threatening. Ryld and Valas moved to join him as the other matron mothers gathered around the throne, and the assortment of wizards, priestesses, and soldiers flanked everyone else. Pharaun knew the woman was Faeryl\u0027s mother, of course, but he couldn\u0027t guess what she was doing on the throne of House Melarn. The mage looked around the chamber, trying to find Faeryl. She was there, though off in a corner of the room, as if she were trying to avoid notice. If I didn\u0027t know better, Pharaun thought wryly, I would have to assume they\u0027re expecting some sort of trouble. Neither Valas nor Ryld said anything, but the wizard could feel them on either side of him, tense and ready to spring. \"We are honored and delighted to be guests in your House, Matron Mother Zauvirr,\" Pharaun said. \"To what do we owe this auspicious occasion?\" And where in the Abyss are Quenthel and Jeggred? he silently added. Ssipriina Zauvirr sniffed and replied, \"On the contrary, Pharaun Mizzrym, I should be the one thanking you and asking you why you have graced the City of Shimmering Webs with your august presence. The reputation that preceded you, telling of a confident, self-possessed mage of no smallskill, was only half the story, it seems.\" Pharaun smiled in the most disarming way he could muster as he shifted his weight to one foot, letting the other turn out slightly. \"Everyone has her own opinions, as always, Matron Mother. That is not to say that anyone is in error, only that affectations and realities do not always mesh, and for good reason.\" \"Of course,\" another matron mother said, moving forward from Ssipriina\u0027s left, \"and our opinion is that you and your companions, while affecting the appearance of simple travelers or even emissaries from our sister city of Menzoberranzan, are in reality spies, here to steal from us and expose whatever weaknesses you thought you might be able to find to the world at large.\" So much for affectations, thought Pharaun, shifting his weight uneasily. He felt, rather than saw Ryld, to his left, and Valas, to his right, both stiffen at the undisguised accusation. \"Easy,\" he muttered under his breath. \"Save the foolish heroics for the \u0027all-else-fails\u0027 part of the program.\" Smoothing his face as best he could, the mage spread his hands in gracious acquiescence and said, \"I\u0027m sorry, Mistress . . .\" \"Matron Mother Jyslin Aleanrahel, of House Aleanrahel.\" Pharaun swallowed then said, \"Matron Mother Aleanrahel. While I\u0027m sure our efforts at avoiding attention must seem terribly surreptitious, I can assure you that we meant nothing antagonistic. We only wished to - \" \"To avoid being confronted like this?\" Jyslin interjected. \"How well did that serve you?\" Pharaun sighed and said, \"Not well at all, it appears, but my companions and I still aren\u0027t completely sure we understand your concerns. I must profess, I am confused as to why we\u0027re meeting here, if none of you is Matron Mother Melarn.\" Several of the matron mothers gave each other knowing glances. Pharaun was thoroughly confused. He continued to scan the room and saw something else quite odd: a drow, obviously nobly born but stripped to her underclothes and held prisoner between two stout guards, and it wasn\u0027t Quenthel. \"Oh, we have no concerns,\" Jyslin Aleanrahel replied. \"Not anymore. Until you arrived, we were concerned that we would not be able to detain you, that you might try to slip out of the city. We were concerned that you would report your discoveries to your superiors back in the City of Spiders. We were more concerned that you would try something foolish, like concluding your high priestess\u0027s ill-conceived plan of theft and spying. You\u0027ve cooperated nicely, though, so we feel we have the situation well in hand.\" Ryld made an almost inaudible strangled noise, and the mage felt the warrior shift his weight. In response, several of the soldiers, who had unassumingly fanned out to more completely surround the trio, tensed as though expecting Ryld to lunge at them. Pharaun frowned. \"I wasn\u0027t aware that our high priestess was planning anything of the sort,\" he said. \"If something is amiss, we must all work to see that it is rectified. Just tell us where she is, and I\u0027m sure we can resolve whatever - \" \"Quenthel Baenre was caught committing treasonous acts against Ched Nasad,\" yet a third matron mother said, stepping out from behind the throne. Pharaun sensed that this one, with a graceful age about her face, might just be the most formidable drow he\u0027d ever met. \"There was no doubt about her guilt. She died trying to flee the scene of her crimes.\" Pharaun blinked, reeling. Dead? Quenthel Baenre was dead? He wasn\u0027t sure whether to laugh or be worried. Behind him, he heard both of his companions\u0027 gasps of surprise. \"She was caught conspiring with House Melarn to illegally enter the city and steal valuable resources belonging to us,\" the older drow said, \"and we believe she was also committing espionage on behalf of Menzoberranzan. We consider these to be crimes against the city, against all drow, and most especially against the Dark Mother herself.\" Conspiracy? Pharaun thought. How ridiculous could they be? He stared at the throne where Faeryl\u0027s mother sat, and he was beginning to understand who was behind it, and perhaps why. No wonder Faeryl was so eager to help us, he thought. She was leading us by our noses the whole time. \"Furthermore,\" the matron mother continued, \"you, by association with Quenthel, are accused of the same charges. You are under arrest, and you will be confined on the premises until such time as we can determine your guilt or innocence.\" \"Not today,\" Ryld said, taking a step forward and reaching for Splitter. As one, a multitude of soldiers brandished hand crossbows, and at least half a dozen wizards and priestesses appeared to ready spells. \"Ryld, you fool, wait!\" Pharaun growled, still trying to keep his voice low. \"There are better ways ...\" Valas reached a hand out and stopped the larger drow from finishing the act of unsheathing his greatsword. \"Not yet,\" the scout pleaded. \"We\u0027ve got no chance like this.\" Ryld snarled, but he released the hilt of his weapon and stepped back again. \"Good,\" the third matron mother said. \"You are not as foolhardy as Faeryl suggested. Though the bravado is misplaced here, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s served you well in the past,\" \"Mistress . . . ?\" Pharaun began. \"Aunrae Nasadra, of First House Nasadra,\" the drow finished for him. Of course you are, the wizard thought. \"Mistress Nasadra,\" he said, \"while I am shocked and saddened by the news of Quenthel\u0027s death, I implore you to hear me out. I have absolutely no knowledge of any conspiracy between her and anyone here in the city. There must have been a great misunderstanding.\" \"I doubt it,\" Aunrae replied, \"but you may yet have a chance to prove it and spare your neck. Simply tell us the truth. Did you or did you not sneak into the city and meet in secret with Drisinil Melarn, matron mother of House Melarn, in order to steal goods out of Black Claw Mercantile\u0027s storehouses?\" Pharaun looked around at the myriad faces staring expectantly at him - and at the scores of weapons leveled at him and his two companions - and he did the only thing he could; he lied. \"Absolutely, Mistress Nasadra,\" he deadpanned, and everyone including Ryld and Valas gasped. Before the other two Menzoberranyr could refute his false admission, he continued, \"Or rather, Quenthel must have. It all makes sense, now. You see, Mistress, she ordered my two companions and me to track down caravans that could help transport a large amount of goods, without telling us what they were for. Mistress Baenre told us males very little, you must realize. \"Right before we set out to follow her instructions, I overheard her speaking with Faeryl Zauvirr, the ambassador to Menzoberranzan who was accompanying us. I recall that she said something about meeting with her mother and one other, though of course at the time, I didn\u0027t know to whom she was referring. She asked Faeryl something to the effect of, \u0027and you\u0027re certain the meeting place is secure? We can\u0027t afford to be seen, you know.\u0027 \" \"You pompous, smart-mouthed liar!\" Faeryl screamed from across the room. \"Kill them now and be done with it!\" Pharaun did all he could to avoid smiling. Around him, everyone began to talk at once, and though he heard more than a few snatches of conversation condemning him and his outlandish story, he knew that he had sown the seeds of doubt. Already, though, the troops who had surrounded them - troops wearing the insignia of House Zauvirr - began to advance uncertainly upon the three of them. \"All right, wizard,\" Ryld hissed, \"we\u0027re out of time. What are we going to do?\" Pharaun opened his mouth to tell the warrior that he had absolutely no idea, when a sudden and violent shudder rocked the chamber, causing everyone to stumble and flail about, their center of balance disrupted. A split second later, a monumental thundercrash penetrated the walls, deep and loud, and reverberated through the entire room. \"By the Dark Mother,\" someone cried as everyone looked at everyone else in confusion and panic. A servant ran into the chamber, a wild look of fear in his eyes. \"Mistresses! It\u0027s duergar! Hundreds of them, surrounding us ... they\u0027re attacking!\" Another sonic shock knocked the liveried boy to his knees, and he seemed to hug the floor in terror. \"They burn the stones themselves, Mothers. The city is burning!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurrection-war-of-the-spider-queen-2/page-11.html","bookId":2160,"book":{"id":2160,"title":"Insurrection (War of the Spider Queen #2)","description":"Storyline: Insurrection (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
