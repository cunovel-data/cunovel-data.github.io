{"id":97354,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Aliisza was more than a little surprised to see the horde of duergar seemingly appear out of thin air around the great manor Pharaun and his companions had entered. From the looks on their faces, though, she wasn\u0027t nearly as surprised as the drow who were guarding the place. The gray dwarves, whom she estimated numbered between two and three thousand, had formed a line along one side of the manor house before making themselves visible by firing off a volley of crossbows. They also lobbed several dozen small clay pots, which burst into orange balls of flame upon impacting the stonework wall that surrounded the manor.\n The few drow who\u0027d been lounging around near the palatial front gates scrambled for cover as the hail of bolts and incendiary bombs struck. The blast from the initial attack shook the entire web street, and Aliisza had to improve her grip to avoid slipping and falling from her roost on the roof of the building on the opposite side of the open plaza. When she could look again, she saw that few of the dark elves had survived the first attack.\n An alarm was quickly sounded inside the courtyard of the cyst-like building, and more drow appeared from inside, a large contingent of them, in fact. Aliiszawatched as they formed a line across the protective wall and returned fire with their hand crossbows. Several duergar dropped before the barrage, but the gray dwarves exhibited wise tactics, throwing up a shield wall with the front rank and firing a second volley from behind that protective barrier. In several places, the stone itself seemed to burn from the duergar fire bombs, and the fire was spreading.\n In the plaza, citizens of Ched Nasad scrambled for cover, and in the distance, Aliisza could see a large column of troops marching, one web street over, in her direction. The duergar were about to have unwanted company ... or so she thought.\n That\u0027s when the second mass of gray dwarves appeared inside the courtyard, flanking the drow who had formed up to defend the front gates.\n Oh, how clever, the alu-fiend thought. They look like they\u0027ve done this a time or two.\n Pharaun never hesitated.\n \"Scatter,\" he said sharply to the two drow with him.\n He willed a spell into being. Ordinarily he would have needed at least a few seconds to speak the phrase and perform the gesturesto bring the effect about, but he had enhanced this particular magic, and this conjuration simply happened as he thought it, with no gestures, words, or delays. A thick, roiling mist appeared, obscuring everything around the wizard. He knew that Ryld would know how to take care of himself, and he hoped that Valas would understand, too. He promptly dismissed them from his mind as he levitated upward.\n Another concussive blast shook the House, though the wizard, hovering in the air, only heard it this time. He floated all the way to the ceiling, casting a spell of invisibility on himself. He knew it wouldn\u0027t completely obscure him from the more clever wizards and matron mothers, but it would at least prevent the common soldiery from spotting him. From below, he could hear the turmoil and confusion as a host of drow reacted to both the messenger\u0027s words and the rumbles in the foundation.\n When he reached the ceiling, Pharaun reached inside hispiwafwiand extracted a small pinch of diamond dust. He incanted once more, watching as the dust vanished in a sparkle of light. It would further conceal him, he hoped, this time from detection magic.\n By then, someone had had the presence of mind to magically dissipate Pharaun\u0027s mist, and the floor below was clear once more. The Master of Sorcere surveyed the entire chamber, looking for signs of Ryld and Valas. The scout was nowhere to be found, which didn\u0027t surprise the wizard in the least, and Ryld had maneuvered himself off to one side of the room. The weapons master crouched behind some statuary, Splitter in hand, watching as the enemy ran here and there.\n He won\u0027t stay hidden long, Pharaun reasoned, knowing the matron mothers still intended to mete out their own personal justice just as soon as they could restore some order.\n Considering quickly, the wizard dug out a bit of fleece from one of his pockets. With it he manufactured another spell. This one he cast at Ryld, creating a little enhancement to the warrior\u0027s hiding place. When he was done, a new, illusory statue stood where Ryld was, further concealing him.\n Pharaun turned his attention back to the center of the room, where several wizards were standing, some of them casting. Another was carefully turning, peering in every direction, and Pharaun could see that magic emanated from the drow.\n They\u0027re looking for us, the Master of Sorcere realized.\n Fumbling around in his pockets, Pharaun found what he was looking for: a tiny hammer and bell, both made of silver. Striking the hammer against the bell, the wizard produced another magical effect. This time, the results were flashy.\n A horrid vibration beat through the floor beneath the wizards\u0027 feet, causing them to clap their hands over their ears and stumble about. Even the one who\u0027d been scanning the room seemed startled, though he planted his feet and continued searching. As the vibration reached a crescendo, the stone of the floor itself could no longer stand the strain and began to fracture. A thousand spiderwebbing cracks shot through the floor, making footing unstable and knocking many of the wizards down. The floor continued to fracture until it was nothing but pulverized powder, half a foot deep. The downed wizards kicked up dust as they flailed about, trying to regain their footing. Several of them didn\u0027t move at all.\n Excellent, Pharaun thought, but his elation was short-lived. Ryld had been discovered and was engaged in a fierce battle with several House Melarn soldiers and at least two priestesses. Though blood streamed from a gash across one arm, the warrior was otherwise holding his own, but Pharaun knew that it wouldn\u0027t last long if anyone was able to bring magic into play. Already, the mage could see a priestess unfurling a scroll. Before he could act, though, Valas stepped up behind her, seemingly from nowhere - How does he do that? Pharaun marveled - and plunged one of his two curved daggers into the small of her back. As the cleric dropped woodenly to the floor, the scout was turning away, and Pharaun lost sight of him again when the wizard turned his attention for a moment to the other side of the room.\n There, several of the matron mothers had come together, protected by a significant portion of their entourage, and were huddled around something Pharaun couldn\u0027t see. He considered whether to strike at them while they were in such close proximity but dismissed the idea.\n Don\u0027t want to draw any more attention to myself than necessary, he decided.\n Pharaun felt the tingle of magic being cast at him, and he saw another wizard with his finger pointed in his direction. Somehow, they\u0027d discovered his position. Pharaun realized he was glowing with a pale violet flame, despite his invisible state. Already, several other wizards were looking in his direction, and a handful of soldiers were arming crossbows.\n Damnation! the mage thought.\n He quickly pulled hispiwafwi around himself and turned away as the first volley of bolts crashed into the ceiling around him. He felt a pair of the missiles strike his back, but thepiwafwi did its job. There was no way he could eliminate the faerie fire around himself without also dismissing the invisibility, he knew, but if he simply let himself be a target, he would wind up a pincushion. Shaking his head in consternation, Pharaun quickly dropped from his position, pulling up just short of hitting the floor.\n The contingent of wizards and soldiers had followed Pharaun\u0027s descent and were moving to close with him. Two soldiers brandishing long swords came at him from opposite sides, and though he was able to duck the first attack cleanly, the other one caught him flush across the arm, penetrating hispiwafwi. Blood spurted from the gash as the mage cried out in pain. A heartbeat later, he and his two adversaries were engulfed in a torrent, as though they had danced their dance into the center of a waterfall - only it wasn\u0027t water. It burned like fire, and both of the sword wielders shrieked and thrashed as their skin blistered and reddened. Pharaun felt his own skin bubbling and boiling as he flung hispiwafwi up to shield his face and threw himself clear, moving at an unnaturally rapid pace, thanks to the magic of his boots.\n Rolling free of the downpour of acid, Pharaun summoned his rapier as he leaped to his feet, continuing his forward progress right at two more soldiers. He used the hovering, dancing rapier to hold the pair of drow at bay just enough so he could pass between them before they even knew he was coming. Once he was through, he headed in the direction of Ryld, while more crossbow bolts and a couple of streaking missiles of light and fire fizzled out as they reached his form.\n Valas had hidden himself away again, but Ryld was hard at work, surrounded by no less than six opponents. With each swing of Splitter, the burly warrior parried several weapons at once. His chest was heaving, and he was covered in blood from a dozen small wounds. He didn\u0027t appear capable of going on the offensive with so many foes surrounding him.\n As Pharaun closed with his companion, he had the magical rapier slash at the back of one of Ryld\u0027s adversaries. The blade jabbed into the drow soldier from behind, causing the poor fellow to arch his back in agony and crumple to the ground. Grimly, Pharaun ordered the rapier to return and protect him as he began to conjure another spell.\n Backing himself into a defensive position near the same statues that Ryld had used to hide himself earlier, the Master of Sorcere extracted a second pinch of the powdered diamond. This time, though, the spell he wove created an invisible barrier between himself and the dozen or so soldiers and wizards who had been pursuing him. The location where Ryld had chosen to hide was more or less in a corner of the great audience chamber, and Pharaun took advantage of that by stretching his invisible wall at an angle, sealing himself and the Master of Melee-Magthere off from most of the rest of the chamber, with only the five drow who were still surrounding Ryld to contend with.\n The Master of Sorcere turned his attention to aiding Ryld as the other soldiers painfully discovered his magical wall. He ignored the thumps they made as the first two or three slammed into the barrier, but he couldn\u0027t help but smile. Ryld had fatally wounded a second foe, a priestess who was writhing on the floor in a growing pool of blood. Pharaun drew out his own crossbow and loaded the weapon even as he brought his dancing rapier to bear on a drow male who was trying to get in behind Ryld.\n The rapier slashed, grazing the guard\u0027s shoulder, and as the soldier turned to protect himself from this new threat, Pharaun fired his crossbow, striking true. The soldier grunted in surprise and pain as the bolt took him in the shoulder of his weapon arm. He dropped his long sword and staggered backward, eyeing the rapier as it flitted about in front of him. Pharaun reloaded the crossbow and was taking aim when Valas stepped from a shadow and finished the guard from behind. Eyes wide, the drow gasped and tried to say something, seemed confused that his words wouldn\u0027t form, then died, sliding to the floor as the scout freed his kukri from its victim.\n \"I assume that\u0027s you, wizard? What\u0027s the point of being invisible if you\u0027re going to glow all purple like that?\"\n \"I\u0027m glad to see you wound up on the right side of things,\" Pharaun said, then staggered as another rumble shook the building. \"By the Dark Mother, what is going on out there?\" he said, steadying himself from the aftershocks.\n \"Whatever it is, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s better to be out there or in here,\" Valas replied, wiping his curved dagger clean on the dead drow\u0027spiwafwi.\"We\u0027ve got to get out of here.\"\n Pharaun nodded, forgetting that the scout couldn\u0027t see him, then he said, \"I agree\" before turning to see how Ryld had fared.\n The warrior was facing only a single opponent, stepping warily around the slick pools of blood as he feinted a few times. His ploys weren\u0027t terribly effective, and he was gasping for breath. His close-cropped white hair was matted red with blood.\n Valas crept forward, ready to get in another attack from behind the moment an opportunity presented itself, so the mage turned his attention back to his magical wall, confident his two companions had the situation well in hand.\n On the other side of the barrier, several of the drow wizards were levitating, testing to see if Pharaun had left any gaps along the ceiling. Another wizard was obviously casting, trying to find something that would dispel the effect. Soldiers stood at the ready, fingering their weapons and eyeing Pharaun and his two companions balefully. Pharaun knew by sense that the magical partition still held, but it would only be a matter of time before their enemies would find the right combination of magic to bring it down.\n At that moment, Pharaun noted the smoke on the far side of the room. It was where the matron mothers had been, but they were no longer there.\n Of course not, the mage thought sardonically. They\u0027re not going to come out until they know we\u0027re in custody again.\n The smoke, however, was thick and black and seemed to be pouring into the room through a hole in the wall. He could see flames licking the stone, and he realized what was going on.\n \"We\u0027ve definitely got to get out of here,\" the mage said to Valas.\n \"That\u0027s what I said,\" Valas replied, \"but you seem to have sealed us in here.\"\n Ryld had dispatched his final adversary and sank down to one knee, trying to regain his breath.\n \"Hello, Pharaun. It\u0027s good to \u0027see\u0027 you. You two aren\u0027t going to walk through walls again, are you?\" Ryld asked, heaving himself to his feet again.\n On the other side of the barrier, some of the House Melarn delegation had lost interest in them, turning and pointing back at the smoke or running toward it. Whatever was happening in the obscured side of the audience chamber, they were very agitated.\n \"Alas,\" Pharaun answered the warrior, \"I have exhausted my quota of wall-walking for the day. I\u0027ll have to rely on more conventional means of egress, I\u0027m afraid. Still, we shouldn\u0027t tarry. That smoke is from the same stuff we had to deal with during the insurrection back in Menzoberranzan.\"\n \"The fire bombs that burned the very stone?\" Valas asked.\n \"Then that means . . .\" Ryld added.\n \"Precisely. We may be contending with associates of Syrzan, or others, who are inciting the populace to riot and arming them with the same tools of destruction.\"\n \"I thought you said the alhoon was operating alone, an outcast from its own kind,\" Ryld said, turning in circles and analyzing every nook and cranny of the corner of the room.\n \"I did,\" Pharaun admitted. \"In my conversation with the thing during our captivity, it claimed that very thing. Perhaps whoever supplied it or its minions with the alchemical incendiary jugs is serving multiple fronts.\"\n \"Regardless of who\u0027s doing it, we know how grave the situation is,\" Valas said. \"We need to get out of the city.\"\n \"Again, I agree,\" Pharaun said. \"I suggest we make a run for it once I lower the barrier.\"\n \"Into that mob?\" Ryld countered. \"We should try to find another way out.\"\n \"But that\u0027s the quickest way to the streets. We don\u0027t know our way around in here, and House Melarn could be an inferno before long.\"\n \"Look,\" Ryld argued, \"you may be feeling fine, but I can\u0027t take another stand-up fight right now.\" He gestured at his own bloody form. \"There\u0027s got to be other ways out of this House. Let\u0027s go find one.\" The warrior gestured toward a door in the corner and added, \"Leave your barrier up and let\u0027s go.\"\n Valas nodded and said, \"Ryld is right. We can\u0027t fight through all of them. Let\u0027s try another route.\"\n \"Very well,\" Pharaun sighed, \"but if the House falls down around our ears, I will personally blame both of you.\"\n He gestured toward the door, inviting Valas to lead the way.\n For the first few minutes, the halls of House Melarn were remarkably empty as Ryld, Pharaun, and Valas limped their way through them. Occasionally, the trio heard running footsteps in the twisting, winding passages that threaded their way through the massive structure, but they were able to avoid confrontations by either taking a detour or momentarily hiding. It appeared to the Master of Melee-Magthere that most of the inhabitants were focusing their attention outside, where the bulk of the fighting was taking place.\n As they reached an intersection, Valas held up his hand for ahalt, and the scout slunk off in one direction, investigating the route ahead. Ryld and Pharaun pressed themselves against the wall, trying to remain out of sight. The wizard was no longer invisible, nor was he glowing with that annoying, flickering purple hue. Ryld had taken care of that with a pass of his enchanted blade. The warrior could see that his companion\u0027s skin was blistered, and he imagined that Pharaun was in considerable pain. His own wounds troubled him only when he thought about them.\n Don\u0027t you have some sort of magic that can help us locate an exit?Ryld flashed to the wizard as they waited.\n Pharaun shook his head.\n Such spells exist, but I don\u0027t know them,he silently replied.Without knowing the way, we could be down here forever. This is a fool\u0027s errand, Ryld.\n Then perhaps we should just follow the soldiers. They can unwittingly lead us out of here.\n Pharaun waved away the warrior\u0027s suggestion, though whether it was in exasperation or acceptance, Ryld wasn\u0027t sure.\n The risk of discovery or disaster is greater if we do that.\n Ryld shrugged but gave no other reply. Instead, he turned to Watch for Valas\u0027s return.\n Why do I bother arguing? the weapons master thought as his listened for telltale sounds. He\u0027s already made up his mind.\n Valas returned at that moment, gesturing for them to follow him. Together, they crept forward into a new corridor, and Valas pointed to a doorway on the opposite side.\n That\u0027s a kitchen,he signaled,and beyond it is a pantry. On the other side, here - the scout pointed to a door near the trio - is a mess hall. I think we\u0027re in the barracks section.\n Well, that\u0027s not a good place to be,Pharaun gestured.We want to avoid the guards, not come bunk with them.\n Valas gave Pharaun a baleful look and motioned for the other two to follow him.Ithink there\u0027s a stairwell leading up just past this area, he flashed as he led the way through the passage.\n Ryld thought they might actually get lucky and get through the guards\u0027 quarters unnoticed, but as they neared the opposite end of the passageway that bisected the barracks and the mess, they heard the approach of a large contingent from ahead of them. As one, the three drow turned to scamper back in the other direction, but at that moment several House Zauvirr soldiers appeared at the other end. They were pinned between the two forces.\n \"Damn!\" Pharaun growled as he reached inside hispiwafwi. \"Hold them off while I see what I can do.\"\n Nodding, Ryld slipped Splitter free and approached the group coming from where Valashad indicated stairs.\n If we can cut through them, the warrior reasoned, at least we can continue the waywe want to go.\n The soldiers, numbering four, gave a shout of warning and unsheathed their weapons.\n \"Come on, you son of a drider,\" one of them snarled, stepping in with a long sword and a short sword together, one in each hand.\n The other three fanned out, looking for a chance to flank the burly intruder. Ryld kept his blade level and loose, waiting and watching, shifting from foot to foot in hopes of preventing any of his foes from getting past him and to his back, or reaching Pharaun. He worried that his hands, still covered with drying blood, would be too slick to wield his blade properly.\n The first opponent stepped in, slashing with his short sword up high, then bringing his long sword through in a sweep across Ryld\u0027s midsection. The weapons master ducked below the first slice and parried the lower blow with Splitter.\n Try that again, and I\u0027ll have you down to two short swords, Ryld thought, watching to see if the other drow would fall into a pattern.\n To his left, another of the soldiers was trying to scoot along the wall, obviously hoping he could squeeze past Ryld, but the Master of Melee-Magthere was keeping them all in his line of sight. He made a quick slash to the side, causing the soldier to flinch back. Ryld bounced back to the middle of the corridor, still watching the drow with two blades. The other two drow, both on Ryld\u0027s right, were waiting and watching.\n Fine with me, Ryld thought, keeping his main attention on the one in front of him.\n The drow changed tactics this time, stepping in with the long sword leading, and proceeded through a flurry of blows with only that weapon, watching how Ryld blocked them. When Ryld swung through a parry and counterattacked, the other warrior was ready, deflecting the stroke with the short sword. Unfortunately, the engagement allowed the drow on Ryld\u0027s left to finally shoot past him.\n \"Pharaun!\" Ryld called, \"watch out!\"\n He stepped away from the center of the hallway, angling backward to keep his opponents in his sight, and the weapons master could hear cries of pain and terror behind him. He hoped it was the other group of drow, and not his two companions. The male with two swords pressed in again, and this time Ryld was ready for him. When the first swipe from the short sword passed high, Ryld knew that the long sword would follow low. This time when the stroke approached Ryld cut sharply with his own blade, neatly slicing the long sword in half. The broken end skittered away with a clatter.\n \"Damn you, motherless rothe!\" the other drow snarled, but he gasped in the next instant as Ryld\u0027s momentum spun the weapons master fully around in a circle and into him again.\n His cut was quick and true, and the opponent dropped to the floor with a groan. Ryld didn\u0027t waste time watching him fall. He was already sidestepping the attack from the soldier who\u0027d gotten behind him and who was trying to cut at him from the back. He took a short spear in the side of his leg for his troubles and growled in pain as he back-stepped from the attack, limping. He couldn\u0027t let himself get turned away from anyone, yet they were moving to do just that by surrounding him.\n Appearing as if from nowhere, Valas caught the soldier with the long sword from behind, sliding an arm around his neck and planting one of his kukris into the fellow\u0027s back. Seeing the attack, Ryld quickly turned and parried several thrusts from the short spears. The final two drow had hoped to get in close and attack Ryld while his attention was focused on the opposite side, but they\u0027d lost their chance.\n Ryld stepped fully into the middle of the hallway again, wanting as much room as possible to use Splitter. When the two House Zauvirr soldiers saw that the odds were down to two to one and would quickly be even with Valas beside him, they faltered and began to back up.\n A staccato series of glowing bluish-white missiles shot past Ryld, slamming into the two drow as they tried to turn and flee. A few of the magical streaks of light fizzled out as they reached their targets, but far more of them struck true, causing the two soldiers to shudder and convulse as they went sprawling to the floor. Ryld glanced back to see Pharaun holding a slender length of some darkly stained wood cut from a tree on the surface world.\n The wizard nodded in satisfaction and tucked the wand away.\n \"We mustn\u0027t tarry,\" he said, \"Everyone in the entire House probably heard that.\"\n Curious, Ryld took another glance back past Pharaun to where the other contingent of drow had been. They were all dead, clutched in the grip of the black, shiny tentacles the mage sometimes summoned. The tentacles continued to squeeze and contract around the bodies of those unfortunate soldiers or flailed about blindly if they had nothing to grip.\n Turning back, Ryld followed the other two past the dead drow and into the stairwell.\n Halisstra stumbled and lost her balance as the deep rumble shook House Melarn. To either side of her, the guards who were \"escorting\" her into the audience chamber stumbled as well, losing their grips on the drow noble\u0027s arms as they flailed about, trying to regain their collective balance. All around Halisstra, shouts rose as drow began to mill about uncertainly in the confusion caused by the vibration, whatever it was. Stunned as much by the proceedings that had been taking place in her mother\u0027s House - her House now, Halisstra realized - as by the shock wave that tore through the place, Halisstra merely stood in place, dressed in only her underclothes and with her arms securely manacled behind her back, staring at the chaos around her.\n When the liveried servant from House Nasadra ran into the room, announcing the fighting outside, Halisstra blinked in astonishment.\n Duergar? Attacking House Melarn? Why in the Abyss would they - \n A second blast rocked House Melarn and knocked Halisstra off her feet. Or rather, it would have if someone hadn\u0027t caught her from behind.\n \"On your feet. . . I\u0027ve got to get you out of here.\"\n It was Danifae, dressed for battle and looking remarkably like just another guard in a House Zauvirr piwafwi.\n Halisstra struggled to right herself with Danifae\u0027s help, then turned to look at her battle captive. The servant was not normally permitted to arm and armor herself, but she was currently wearing her old chain shirt and buckler and had her morning star at her side. Halisstra wondered how Danifae had managed to get to her accoutrements, which had been locked away in Halisstra\u0027s rooms, but she wasn\u0027t going to take the time to complain just then.\n Halisstra heard a shout from behind them, and she turned, expecting to see her original guards realizing she was free. Instead, she discovered that a thick mist had filled the room, and she could see very little beyond a couple of paces away.\n \"Come on,\" Halisstra hissed, scrambling through the mist toward the back of the room, to a doorway leading deeper into the House where her own chambers were located. \"Back to my rooms, and you can get these - \"she held her arms out away from her back to indicate the manacles - \"off me.\"\n \"Of course, Mistress,\" Danifae said, steering her superior by one arm through the thick, obscuring mist, along the wall and toward the door. \"We\u0027ll thank someone later for hiding our escape with this fog.\"\n \"You mean, that\u0027s not something you and Lirdnolu Maerret planned to help extricate me from Ssipriina Zauvirr?\"\n Danifae laughed once, a bitter chuckle.\n \"Hardly,\" she said, \"Despite my convincing performance before Matron Mother Zauvirr, you didn\u0027t really expect her to let me wander free did you? I had no way to reach House Maerret. No, that commotion back there was someone else\u0027s doing,\"\n Once the two of them were out of the audience chamber and into the hall, Halisstra could see better, and she set off regally toward her own chambers, despite the fact that she was half-naked and bound. She hadn\u0027t managed more than three or four steps before a third rumble staggered her. She gasped as she lost her balance and stumbled against one wall of the hallway, but Danifae was there, catching hold of her mistress and steadying her as the tremor quieted.\n \"What the blazes is going on?\" Halisstra demanded as they righted themselves and hurried on their way.\n \"I don\u0027t know for sure, but I can hazard a guess,\" her subordinate replied as they turned a corner. \"There are riots welling up in the streets.\"\n \"Perhaps,\" Halisstra said, \"but why would duergar target House Melarn?\"\n \"That, I can\u0027t say,\" Danifae replied, \"but my guess is it has more to do with Ssipriina Zauvirr\u0027s attempt to overthrow House Melarn than anything else. Regardless, it served my purposes well enough. Perhaps we can find out more in a little bit, after we get you out of those restraints.\"\n \"Yes,\" Halisstra answered, thinking. \"Let\u0027s start with finding out where in the Nine Hells all of our House guards are.\"\n \"I can tell you that right now,\" Danifae offered as the duo turned another corner and entered Halisstra\u0027s chambers. \"They accepted an offer they couldn\u0027t refuse: serve House Zauvirr or die.\"\n Halisstra sighed.\n \"Is there anyone still loyal to me?\" she asked, though she feared she already knew the answer.\n \"Possibly your brother, if he\u0027s still alive, but he\u0027s at the Dangling Tower and can\u0027t do us much good here,\" Danifae said, turning Halisstra around so that she could take a look at the locking mechanism on the restraints. \"As for inside the House right now? I doubt anyone would be willing to aid you, except maybe those three males in the audience chamber, the ones from Menzoberranzan, and only if you win their trust.\" The battle captive shook her head. \"I can\u0027t get these off right now. Better to break the chain and worry about them later.\"\n \"Fine . . . but what do you mean, \u0027win their trust?\u0027 How could I do that?\"\n Halisstra began to pace, pondering her options. Though she had managed to escape the matron mothers for the moment, she was still trapped - inside her own House, of all places - and doubted it would take long for Ssipriina\u0027s guards to close in on the two of them.\n Danifae didn\u0027t answer right away. Halisstra turned to repeat her question and saw the other dark elf grab the noble\u0027s mace from where it stood in the corner by her bed. She was momentarily startled when Danifae returned to her side and pushed her to her knees, but she quickly understood the battle captive\u0027s intent, and positioned her hands near the floor where Danifae could strike the chain while it was against the stone.\n \"You could start by telling them that their high priestess is still alive,\" Danifae finally answered, drawing the mace back for a hard blow against the chain joining the manacles.\n \"What?\" Halisstra gasped, turning to look at her servant. \"Quenthel Baenre is alive?\"\n For a brief moment she wondered if her mother had also survived.\n Danifae held her downstroke at the last moment when her mistress moved.\n \"Hold still!\" she commanded, repositioning Halisstra for another try. \"And yes, the Baenre priestess is alive. I saw both her and her demon companion in the dungeons earlier. While I was prowling around, trying to figure out what to do, I saw that male Mistress Zauvirr called Zammzt hurrying from that direction.\"\n Danifae smacked her morning star hard against the chain, but the links didn\u0027t break.\n \"A few moments later,\" she continued, \"Faeryl Zauvirr appeared, also coming from the lower levels. Curious, I decided to see what she was doing down there. She has them both bound to within an inch of their lives, and Quenthel Baenre is stretched tight on the rack at the moment.\"\n Danifae lined up another blow with the mace.\n \"Then Ssipriina is lying! I can free the high priestess and get her to prove my innocence.\"\n Halisstra felt elation for the first time since the catastrophic day had begun.\n \"Possibly,\" the battle captive answered dryly, taking another whack at the restraints, \"but I doubt many of the matron mothers will choose to believe her. She may still be guilty of her crimes, even if you are innocent of yours. Enough of the matron mothers have an agenda that precludes you walking free from this. More likely - ah ha!\"\n The link Danifae had been pounding on finally crimped enough to separate the manacles.\n Helping Halisstra to her feet, the battle captive continued, \"More likely, they\u0027ll simply accuse you of trying to help her escape and offering that as a cover story.\"\n Halisstra eyed the steel restraints still on her wrists, already finding them annoying, but they would have to wait. Free, at least for the moment, Halisstra\u0027s fear melted away. She was furious, and she couldn\u0027t decide who bore the majority of her anger.\n \"Well, I\u0027m not just going to sit here while everyone else brings down House Melarn around my ears. Help me get ready, and let\u0027s go find that Baenre.\"\n \"As you wish,\" Danifae said, moving rapidly with the decision having been made.\n With her servant\u0027s help, Halisstra quickly began to dress, first attiring herself in a set of plain but functional clothes, then donning her armor, a fine suit of chain mail bearing the coat of arms of House Melarn and several enchantments. Once that was on, Danifae handed Halisstra her mace and shield and scurried about the room to gather up other things Halisstra normally had with her when out in the city or beyond.\n When Halisstra was dressed, Danifae grabbed her morning star, each of them wrapped themselves in a piwafwimarked with the insignia of House Zauvirr, and they were ready.\n Outside Halisstra\u0027s rooms, the halls were quiet. No one had yet been sent to hunt for her, it appeared, for which the priestess was silently thankful. Once away from her private quarters, Halisstra began to breathe a little easier. No onewould question two House guards moving through the halls.\n That\u0027s when the two of them came around a bend in the hallway and spied three strange drow, two of them bruised and bleeding,creeping through the gloom. They were definitely not members of the household, but it took Halisstra another moment or two before she realized they were the three Menzoberranyr.\n \"Damn,\" one of them said, reaching inside hispiwafwi as the other two brandished weapons and advanced warily. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurrection-war-of-the-spider-queen-2/page-12.html","bookId":2160,"book":{"id":2160,"title":"Insurrection (War of the Spider Queen #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Insurrection (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
