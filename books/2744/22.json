I want to tell him that I have no problem sleeping with him. The only thing that worries me is that I can be a little clingy. My mom and my ex told me the same thing. They may have told me that so I wouldn’t nag them about where they were going or how long they would be gone. But I know I\u0027m a people person, and if I know someone is around, I want to be where they are. I worry that I might be what my mom and ex said I was, and I never wanted Asher to feel like I was crowding him.\\n\\n “Will you promise me something?” I ask.\\n\\n “What?”\\n\\n “Just promise that, when you start feeling like I\u0027m around too much, you will let me know.”\\n\\n “That’s not going to happen,” he says, cupping my cheek. His thumb slides across my lower lip.\\n\\n “Just promise, okay?” I say, feeling desperate for him to understand how much this means to me.\\n\\n “Promise, baby.”\\n\\n “Thanks.” I grin and he kisses my nose.\\n\\n “Now, do you want to eat here or do you want to pick up something on the way back to my place?” I bite my lip, thinking about it, and his eyes drop to my mouth.\\n\\n “Never mind. We’re picking something up.” He bends down and my belly goes into his shoulder and he carries me out of the garage.\\n\\n “Um, I have to go inside and get some stuff,” I say from my upside down position.\\n\\n “You have shit at my place.”\\n\\n “I packed everything.” He stops and my feet hit the ground. Luckily, his arms came to my shoulders or I would have fallen on my ass.\\n\\n “You packed everything?” He growls.\\n\\n “I didn’t want you to feel like I was suffocating you,” I said in a huff.\\n\\n “Don’t do that shit.” His hands go to my neck, his thumbs sweep under my jaw then his face gets closer to mine. “Unless I tell you that I want space, don’t read into non-existing shit and create problems. I swear,” he says, looking into the sky, “if I don’t want you around, I will tell you that shit straight out. No games, no bullshit.”\\n\\n “Okay,” I whisper, never wanting to hear those words from him.\\n\\n “Okay, now go pack your shit,” he says and I glare at him.\\n\\n “Don’t tell me to pack my shit. It’s rude.”\\n\\n “It’s rude?” he asks, tilting his head to the side. “Baby, I promise you when I get you in my bed, I’ll show you how much you like me being rude.” That made me tingle in a couple different spots. I definitely wanted him to show me how rude he could be. “Just for that look right there, I\u0027m going to make you beg me to be rude to you.”\\n\\n Oh my God, I just had an orgasm standing outside my dad’s house in the daytime. I look around, hoping no one saw me have a mini orgasm. I knew that I had to play this off, so I did what any woman would do,\\n\\n “Whatever.” I rolled my eyes then ran into my dad’s house as quickly as I could with his laughter following me the whole way.\\n\\n Asher\\n\\n I watch November pull up in front of the club on that damn bike. I look over and see a group of guys watching the same thing as me. She puts the kick stand down takes the helmet off and shakes out her hair. She looks like a fucking wet dream sitting on that bike. Her legs are covered in tight denim with black boots laced up to mid-calf. She has a leather jacket on and it’s zipped up half way, showing off a good amount of cleavage. I hear one of the guy whistles and her head comes up, spotting me.\\n\\n “Hey, babe,” she calls and the guy goes to step in her direction. Her nose scrunches and I shake my head at him, walking toward my girl.\\n\\n “You just had to ride the bike, didn’t you?” I ask, not at all surprised.\\n\\n She smiles, shaking her head. “Uncle Joe would be disappointed if I didn’t ride it,” she says, lifting her leg over the seat and putting her helmet under her arm. I look at her and know she’s right. Joe loves his boys, but neither of them ride. Now that his niece has shown an interest in riding, he feels like he has someone to share it with besides Mike.\\n\\n “Did you ride with him today?” I ask, taking the helmet from her.\\n\\n “Yeah, we went out to the park and stopped for lunch.”\\n\\n “Good,” I say and kiss her nose. We walk inside the club past the group of guys standing near the door. It used to bug the shit out of me when men openly checked her out but not anymore. She never even notices. I spot Nico and Cash. They already have a table waiting for us.\\n\\n “Hey, guys,” November says to Cash and Nico. They both stand to hug her. “Where’s Trevor?” she asks, looking around.\\n\\n “He’s picking up Liz,” I tell her and her eyes light up. I shake my head. I have no idea what’s going on with Liz and Trevor. I know he likes her, but I think her innocent vibe is throwing him off. He doesn’t know how to deal with a girl that has no experience. When he found out she needed a ride, he quickly volunteered to pick her up. Maybe they just need some time to get to know each other.\\n\\n “Liz is coming?” Cash asks, rubbing his hands together. He’s been fucking with Trevor every chance he gets. Anytime Liz is around and any guy even looks at her, Trevor looks ready to snap.\\n\\n “Be nice, guys,” November says quietly, taking off her jacket and revealing the low cut shirt that she’s wearing under it. I feel my pulse speed up and look around.\\n\\n “You’re not cold, baby?” I hint for her to put the coat back on. I know if I tell her to put the coat on, she’s going to tell me where to shove it.\\n\\n “Nah, I\u0027m good.” She smiles sweetly. Her eyes go over my shoulder and I see her body get stiff. I turn to see Becky making her way over to us.\\n\\n “Fuck,” I mumble, pulling out a stool, trying to get November to sit down.\\n\\n “Asher!” Becky squeals, throwing herself at me. I remove her arms and hold her back.\\n\\n “Where have you been?” she asks, looking around the table. Her eyes land on November and her face goes hard. “Oh, never mind. See you’re still roaming the streets with the pussy peddler.”\\n\\n “Excuse me?” I feel November stand beside me. “What did you just say?” she asks, trying to get around me.\\n\\n “You need to leave, Becky,” I say, blocking November. Cash and Nico are now standing on either side of November, showing where their loyalty lies.\\n\\n “Your daddy sells pussy.” Becky snarls.\\n\\n “No, my dad sells entertainment.”\\n\\n “You know that some of the girls there sell pussy to their customers when no one’s looking,” Becky says, glaring at November.\\n\\n “What’s your last name?” November asks and Becky puts her hands on her hips.\\n\\n “Hudson,” Cash says. November looks at him then back at Becky.\\n\\n “So, you were one of those girls who was selling pussy while no one was looking, weren’t you, Becky Hudson?” November smirks and Becky takes a step back. “My dad’s club is clean unless trash like you comes in to dirty it up. But then, you know what happens to trash, don’t you, Becky? It always gets thrown out. Don’t talk about my dad’s club again. You worked for him until you tried to make money on the side, and he threw you out like the trash you are.” After landing her final blow, November walks to the bar.\\n\\n “I can’t believe you’re with a girl like her,” Becky says, shaking her head.\\n\\n “You need to go and don’t come back,” I say, turning to the bar. When I reach November’s side, she’s already got her Corona.\\n\\n “I hate women like that,” she says, shaking her head and not looking up from her beer.\\n\\n “Yeah,” I agree, thinking that I wasted a lot of time on women like that. “You okay?” I ask, pulling her into my side and tilting her head back to kiss her.\\n\\n “I will be when I finish this Corona and can order another one,” she mumbles against my lips and I smile against hers. I want to tell her so badly that I love her, but I keep telling myself to let her set the pace. “Let’s go back to the table and enjoy the rest of the night.”\\n\\n Chapter 7\\n\\n It is Christmas Eve and I’m standing in the bathroom trying to finish getting ready to go to Asher’s parents’. It’s been a month since I found out that I was a millionaire. The only person who knows about my inheritance is my dad. I finally agreed with him that I wasn’t going to give my mom half the money. She hasn’t even called since I’ve been in Tennessee. I tried to call her and even left a couple messages but she never returned my calls. I\u0027m sure if I would have mentioned the money, I would have gotten a call back, but I didn’t want that to be the reason she reached out to me.\\n\\n My other dilemma is trying to find a way to tell Asher about the money. Every time I am going to bring it up, I wonder if it will change our relationship. I don’t think it will, but you never really know.\\n\\n We’ve been together for over a month and I still sleep in his bed every night, not that I have any choice in the matter. Anytime I mention staying at my dad’s, he gets a look that tells me if I tried, he would drag me back to his house caveman style. But really, I don’t mind. I love going to sleep with him every night and waking up to him every morning.\\n\\n “Hey, baby. You okay?” Asher asks, coming to stand behind me, his hands going to my waist and his mouth at my neck. My hands are rolling my hot rollers into my hair. I haven’t even gotten dressed yet. I still have on my tank top and sleep shorts. We got up early and had breakfast, and then crawled back into bed.\\n\\n “Yeah,” I whisper as the scruff from his jaw runs down my neck to my shoulder. “Um, actually. I need to tell you something.” I breathe deeply, hoping that I’m doing the right thing.\\n\\n “Tell me.” He bit my earlobe, distracting me.\\n\\n “I, uh…um.”\\n\\n “Babe, uh and um isn’t saying much.”\\n\\n “You’re distracting me. I can’t think when your mouth is on me.” His head comes up and we make eye contact in the mirror. His dimple is out and he has a cocky grin in place.\\n\\n “You like me distracting you with my mouth.” He reminds me of something that I didn’t need to be reminded of right now. Not when I’m trying to tell him something serious. I glare at him in the mirror and he chuckles. “Okay, baby. Tell me,” he says, putting his chin on the top of my head.\\n\\n “I\u0027m a millionaire.” Okay, I didn’t mean to blurt it out quite like that, but now it was out in the open. I feel his body tighten around mine.\\n\\n “What?” he asks. I swallowed and bite my lip. There was no going back. I turned in his arms and put my hands on his chest.\\n\\n “My mom’s parents left me their estate and it’s over a million dollars.”\\n\\n “When did you find this out?” I really didn’t want to answer this question. I looked over his shoulder towards the door.\\n\\n “Eyes on me.” I looked into his eyes again. “When did you find out about this?”\\n\\n “Um…I…” I bite my lip and look away again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-november-until-1/page-22.html","bookId":2744,"book":{"id":2744,"title":"Until November (Until #1)","description":"Storyline: Until November (Until #1) \\n November is looking forward to getting to know her father and the safety of a small town.
