{"id":65565,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"A few silent moments later, Peter tells me it’s time to go. He barely looks at me, scowls at the back wall instead. I suppose it would have been too much to ask, to see a friendly face this morning. I stand, and together we walk down the hallway.\n My toes are cold. My feet stick to the tiles. We turn a corner, and I hear muffled shouts. At first I can’t tell what the voice is saying, but as we draw closer, it takes shape.\n “I want to . . . her!” Tobias. “I . . . see her!”\n I glance at Peter. “I can’t speak to him one last time, can I?”\n Peter shakes his head. “There’s a window, though. Maybe if he sees you he’ll finally shut up.”\n He takes me down a dead-end corridor that’s only six feet long. At the end is a door, and Peter is right, there’s a small window near the top, about a foot above my head.\n “Tris!” Tobias’s voice is even clearer here. “I want to see her!”\n I reach up and press my palm to the glass. The shouts stop, and his face appears behind the glass. His eyes are red; his face, blotchy. Handsome. He stares down at me for a few seconds and then presses his hand to the glass so it lines up with mine. I pretend I can feel the warmth of it through the window.\n He leans his forehead against the door and squeezes his eyes shut.\n I take my hand down and turn away before he can open his eyes. I feel pain in my chest, worse than when I got shot in the shoulder. I clutch the front of my shirt, blink away tears, and rejoin Peter in the main hallway.\n “Thank you,” I say quietly. I meant to say it louder.\n “Whatever.” Peter scowls again. “Let’s just go.”\n I hear rumbling somewhere ahead of us—the sound of a crowd. The next hallway is packed with Dauntless traitors, tall and short, young and old, armed and unarmed. They all wear the blue armband of betrayal.\n “Hey!” Peter shouts. “Clear a path!”\n The Dauntless traitors closest to us hear him, and press against the walls to make way for us. The other Dauntless traitors follow suit soon after, and everyone is quiet. Peter steps back to let me go ahead of him. I know the way from here.\n I don’t know where the pounding starts, but someone drums their fists against the wall, and someone else joins in, and I walk down the aisle between solemn-but-raucous Dauntless traitors, their hands in motion at their sides. The pounding is so fast my heart races to keep up with it.\n Some of the Dauntless traitors incline their heads to me—I’m not sure why. It doesn’t matter.\n I reach the end of the hallway and open the door to my execution chamber.\n I open it.\n Dauntless traitors crowded the hallway; the Erudite crowd the execution room, but there, they have made a path for me already. Silently they study me as I walk to the metal table in the center of the room. Jeanine stands a few steps away. The scratches on her face show through hastily applied makeup. She doesn’t look at me.\n Four cameras dangle from the ceiling, one at each corner of the table. I sit down first, wipe my hands off on my pants, and then lie down.\n The table is cold. Frigid, seeping into my skin, into my bones. Appropriate, perhaps, because that is what will happen to my body when all the life leaves it; it will become cold and heavy, heavier than I have ever been. As for the rest of me, I am not sure. Some people believe that I will go nowhere, and maybe they’re right, but maybe they’re not. Such speculations are no longer useful to me anyway.\n Peter slips an electrode beneath the collar of my shirt and presses it to my chest, right over my heart. He then attaches a wire to the electrode and switches on the heart monitor. I hear my heartbeat, fast and strong. Soon, where that steady rhythm was, there will be nothing.\n And then rising from within me is a single thought:\n I don’t want to die.\n All those times Tobias scolded me for risking my life, I never took him seriously. I believed that I wanted to be with my parents and for all of this to be over. I was sure I wanted to emulate their self-sacrifice. But no. No, no.\n Burning and boiling inside me is the desire to live.\n I don’t want to die I don’t want to die I don’t want to!\n Jeanine steps forward with a syringe full of purple serum. Her glasses reflect the fluorescent light above us, so I can barely see her eyes.\n Every part of my body chants it in unison. Live, live, live. I thought that in order to give my life in exchange for Will’s, in exchange for my parents’, that I needed to die, but I was wrong; I need to live my life in the light of their deaths. I need to live.\n Jeanine holds my head steady with one hand and inserts the needle into my neck with the other.\n I’m not done! I shout in my head, and not at Jeanine. I am not done here!\n She presses the plunger down. Peter leans forward and looks into my eyes.\n “The serum will go into effect in one minute,” he says. “Be brave, Tris.”\n The words startle me, because that is exactly what Tobias said when he put me under my first simulation.\n My heart begins to race.\n Why would Peter tell me to be brave? Why would he offer any kind words at all?\n All the muscles in my body relax at once. A heavy, liquid feeling fills my limbs. If this is death, it isn’t so bad. My eyes stay open, but my head drops to the side. I try to close my eyes, but I can’t—I can’t move.\n Then the heart monitor stops beeping.\n CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\n BUT I’M STILL breathing. Not deeply; not enough to satisfy, but breathing. Peter pushes my eyelids over my eyes. Does he know I’m not dead? Does Jeanine? Can she see me breathing?\n “Take the body to the lab,” Jeanine says. “The autopsy is scheduled for this afternoon.”\n “All right,” Peter replies.\n Peter pushes the table forward. I hear mutters all around me as we pass the group of Erudite bystanders. My hand falls off the edge of the table as we turn a corner, and smacks into the wall. I feel a prickle of pain in my fingertips, but I can’t move my hand, as hard as I try.\n This time, when we go down the hallway of Dauntless traitors, it is silent. Peter walks slowly at first, then turns another corner and picks up the pace. He almost sprints down the next corridor, and stops abruptly. Where am I? I can’t be in the lab already. Why did he stop?\n Peter’s arms slide under my knees and shoulders, and he lifts me. My head falls against his shoulder.\n “For someone so small, you’re heavy, Stiff,” he mutters.\n He knows I’m awake. He knows.\n I hear a series of beeps, and a slide—a locked door, opening.\n “What do—” Tobias’s voice. Tobias! “Oh my God. Oh—”\n “Spare me your blubbering, okay?” Peter says. “She’s not dead; she’s just paralyzed. It’ll only last for about a minute. Now get ready to run.”\n I don’t understand.\n How does Peter know?\n “Let me carry her,” Tobias says.\n “No. You’re a better shot than I am. Take my gun. I’ll carry her.”\n I hear the gun slide out of its holster. Tobias brushes a hand over my forehead. They both start running.\n At first all I hear is the pounding of their feet, and my head snaps back painfully. I feel tingling in my hands and feet. Peter shouts, “Left!” at Tobias.\n Then a shout from down the hallway. “Hey, what—!”\n A bang. And nothing.\n More running. Peter shouts, “Right!” I hear another bang, and another. “Whoa,” he mumbles. “Wait, stop here!”\n Tingling down my spine. I open my eyes as Peter opens another door. He charges through it, and just before I smack my head against the door frame, I stick my arm out and stop us.\n “Careful!” I say, my voice strained. My throat still feels as tight as it did when he first injected me and I found it difficult to breathe. Peter turns sideways to bring me through the door, then nudges it shut with his heel and drops me on the floor.\n The room is almost empty, except for a row of empty trash cans along one wall and a square metal door large enough for one of the cans to fit through it along the other wall.\n “Tris,” Tobias says, crouching next to me. His face is pale, almost yellow.\n There is too much I want to say. The first thing that comes out is, “Beatrice.”\n He laughs weakly.\n “Beatrice,” he amends, and touches his lips to mine. I curl my fingers into his shirt.\n “Unless you want me to throw up all over you guys, you might want to save it for later.”\n “Where are we?” I ask.\n “This is the trash incinerator,” says Peter, slapping the square door. “I turned it off. It’ll take us to the alley. And then your aim had better be perfect, Four, if you want to get out of the Erudite sector alive.”\n “Don’t concern yourself with my aim,” Tobias retorts. He, like me, is barefoot.\n Peter opens the door to the incinerator. “Tris, you first.”\n The trash chute is about three feet wide and four feet high. I slide one leg down the chute and, with Tobias’s help, swing the other leg in. My stomach drops as I slide down a short metal tube. Then a series of rollers pound against my back as I slip over them.\n I smell fire and ash, but I am not burned. Then I drop, and my arm smacks into a metal wall, making me groan. I land on a cement floor, hard, and pain from the impact prickles up my shins.\n “Ow.” I limp away from the opening and shout, “Go ahead!”\n My legs have recovered by the time Peter lands, on his side instead of his feet. He groans, and drags himself away from the opening to recover.\n I look around. We are inside the incinerator, which would be completely dark if not for the lines of light glowing in the shape of a small door on the other side. The floor is solid metal in some places and metal grating in others. Everything smells like rotting garbage and fire.\n “Don’t say I never took you anywhere nice,” Peter says.\n “Wouldn’t dream of it,” I say.\n Tobias drops to the floor, landing first on his feet and then tilting forward to his knees, wincing. I pull him to his feet and then draw close to his side. All the smells and sights and feelings of the world feel magnified. I was almost dead, but instead I am alive. Because of Peter.\n Of all people.\n Peter walks across the grate and opens the small door. Light streams into the incinerator. Tobias walks with me away from the fire smell, away from the metal furnace, into the cement-walled room that contains it.\n “Got that gun?” Peter says to Tobias.\n “No,” says Tobias, “I figured I would shoot the bullets out of my nostrils, so I left it upstairs.”\n “Oh, shut up.”\n Peter holds another gun in front of him and leaves the incinerator room. A dank hallway with exposed pipes in the ceiling greets us, but it’s only ten feet long. The sign next to the door at the end says EXIT. I am alive, and I am leaving.\n The stretch of land between Dauntless headquarters and Erudite headquarters does not look the same in reverse. I suppose everything is bound to look different when you aren’t on your way to die.\n When we reach the end of the alley, Tobias presses his shoulder to one wall and leans forward just enough to see around the corner. His face blank, he puts one arm around the corner, steadying it with the building wall, and fires twice. I shove my fingers in my ears and try not to pay attention to the gunshots and what they make me remember.\n “Hurry,” Tobias says.\n We sprint, Peter first, me second, and Tobias last, down Wabash Avenue. I look over my shoulder to see what Tobias shot at, and see two men on the ground behind Erudite headquarters. One isn’t moving, and the other is clutching his arm and running toward the door. They will send others after us.\n My head feels muddled, probably from exhaustion, but the adrenaline keeps me running.\n “Take the least logical route!” shouts Tobias.\n “What?” Peter says.\n “The least logical route,” Tobias says. “So they won’t find us!”\n Peter swerves to the left, down another alley, this one full of cardboard boxes that contain frayed blankets and stained pillows—old factionless dwellings, I assume. He jumps over a box that I go crashing through, kicking it behind me.\n At the end of the alley he turns left, toward the marsh. We are back on Michigan Avenue. In plain sight of Erudite headquarters, if anyone cares to glance down the street.\n “Bad idea!” I shout.\n Peter takes the next right. At least all the streets here are clear—no fallen street signs to dodge or holes to jump over. My lungs burn like I inhaled poison. My legs, which ached at first, are now numb, which is better. Somewhere far away, I hear shouts.\n Then it occurs to me: The least logical thing to do is stop running.\n I grab Peter’s sleeve and drag him toward the nearest building. It is six stories high, with wide windows arranged into a grid, divided by pillars of brick. The first door I try is locked, but Tobias fires at the window next to it until it breaks, and unlocks the door from the inside.\n The building is completely empty. Not a single chair or table. And there are too many windows. We walk toward the emergency stairwell, and I crawl beneath the first flight so that we are hidden by the staircase. Tobias sits next to me, and Peter across from us both, his knees drawn to his chest.\n I try to catch my breath and calm myself down, but it isn’t easy. I was dead. I was dead, and then I wasn’t, and why? Because of Peter? Peter?\n I stare at him. He still looks so innocent, despite all that he has done to prove that he is not. His hair lies smooth against his head, shiny and dark, like we didn’t just run for a mile at full speed. His round eyes scan the stairwell and then rest on my face.\n “What?” he says. “Why are you looking at me like that?”\n “How did you do it?” I say.\n “It wasn’t that hard,” he says. “I dyed a paralytic serum purple and switched it out with the death serum. Replaced the wire that was supposed to read your heartbeat with a dead one. The bit with the heart monitor was harder; I had to get some Erudite help with a remote and stuff—you wouldn’t understand it if I explained it to you.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurgent-divergent-2/page-32.html","bookId":1699,"book":{"id":1699,"title":"Insurgent (Divergent #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Insurgent (Divergent #2) \n One choice can transform you—or it can destroy you.
