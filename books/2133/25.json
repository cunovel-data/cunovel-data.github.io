{"id":94695,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"The unearthly wail, its notes primal and agonized, echoed off the stone walls of the cavern complex, reverberating into the very heart of the mountain itself.\\n\\n The tips of Le\u0027lorinel\u0027s sword and dagger dipped toward the floor. The elf stopped the training session and turned to regard the room\u0027s open door and the corridor beyond, where that awful cry was still echoing.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Le\u0027lorinel asked as a form rushed by. Jule Pepper, the elf, who sprinted to catch up, guessed.\\n\\n Down the winding way Le\u0027lorinel went, pursuing Jule all the way to the complex of large chambers immediately below those of Sheila Kree and her trusted, brand-wearing compatriots, and into the lair of Chogurugga and Bloog.\\n\\n Le\u0027lorinel had to dodge aside upon entering, as a huge chair sailed by to smash against the stone. Again came that terrible cry - Chogurugga\u0027s shriek. Looking past the ogress, Le\u0027lorinel understood it to be a wail of grief.\\n\\n For there, in the middle of the floor, lay the bloated body of another ogre, a young and strong one. Sheila Kree and Bellany stood over the body beside another ogre who was kneeling, its huge, ugly head resting atop the corpse. At first, Le\u0027lorinel figured it to be Bloog, but then the elf spotted the gigantic ogre leader, looking on from the wall behind them. It didn\u0027t take Le\u0027lorinel long to figure out that the mask of anguish that Bloog wore was far from genuine.\\n\\n It occurred to Le\u0027lorinel that Bloog might have done this.\\n\\n \"Bathunk! Me baby!\" Chogurugga shrieked with concern very atypical for a mother ogress. \"Bathunk! Bathunk!\"\\n\\n Sheila Kree moved to talk to the ogress, perhaps to console her, but Chogurugga went into another flailing fit at that moment, lifting a rock from the huge fire pit and hurling it to smash against the wall - not so far from the ducking Bloog, Le\u0027lorinel noted.\\n\\n \"They found Bathunk\u0027s body near an outpost to the north,\" Bellany explained to Jule and Le\u0027lorinel, the sorceress walking over to them. \"A few were killed, it seems. That one, Pokker, thought it prudent to bring back Bathunk\u0027s body.\" As she explained, she pointed to the ogre kneeling over the body.\\n\\n \"You sound as if he shouldn\u0027t have,\" Jule Pepper remarked.\\n\\n Bellany shrugged as if it didn\u0027t matter. \"Look at the wretch,\" she whispered, nodding her chin toward the wild Chogurugga. \"She\u0027ll likely kill half the ogres in Golden Cove or get herself killed by Bloog.\"\\n\\n \"Or by Sheila,\" Jule observed, for it seemed obvious that Sheila Kree was fast losing patience with the ogress.\\n\\n \"There is always that possibility,\" Bellany deadpanned.\\n\\n \"How did it happen?\" asked Le\u0027lorinel.\\n\\n \"It is not so uncommon a thing,\" Bellany answered. \"We lose a few ogres every year, particularly in the winter. The idiots simply can\u0027t allow good judgment to get in the way of their need to squash people. The soldiers of the Spine of the World communities are veterans all, and no easy mark, even for monsters as powerful and as well-outfitted as Chogurugga\u0027s ogres.\"\\n\\n While Bellany was answering, Le\u0027lorinel subtly moved toward Bathunk\u0027s bloated corpse. Noting that it seemed as if Sheila had Chogurugga momentarily under control then, the elf dared move even closer, bending low to examine the body.\\n\\n Le\u0027lorinel found breathing suddenly difficult. The cuts on the body were, many, were beautifully placed and were, in many different areas, curving. Curving like the blades of a scimitar. Noting one bruise behind Bathunk\u0027s hip, the elf gently reached down and edged the corpse a bit to the side. The mark resembled the imprint of a delicately curving blade, much like the blades Le\u0027lorinel had fashioned for Tunevec during his portrayal of a certain dark elf,\\n\\n Le\u0027lorinel looked up suddenly, trying to digest it all, recognizing clearly that no ordinary soldier had downed this mighty ogre.\\n\\n The elf nearly laughed aloud then - a desire only enhanced when Le\u0027lorinel noticed that Bloog was sniffling and wiping his eyes as if they were teary, which they most surely were not. But another roar from behind came as a clear reminder that a certain ogress might not enjoy anyone making light of this tragedy.\\n\\n Le\u0027lorinel rose quickly and walked back to Jule and Bellany, then kept right on moving out of the room, running back up the passageway to the safety of the upper level. There, the elf gasped and laughed heartily, at once thrilled and scared.\\n\\n For Le\u0027lorinel knew that Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had done this thing, that the drow was in the area - not so far away if the ogre could carry Bathunk back in this wintry climate.\\n\\n \"My thanks, E\u0027kressa,\" the elf whispered.\\n\\n Le\u0027lorinel\u0027s hands went instinctively for sword and dagger, then came together in front, the fingers of the right hand turning the enchanted ring about its digit on the left. After all these years, it was about to happen. After all the careful planning, the studying of Drizzt\u0027s style and technique, the training, the consultations with some of the finest swordsmen of northern Faerun to find ways to counter the drow\u0027s maneuvers. After all the costs, the years of labor to pay for the ring, the partners, the information.\\n\\n Le\u0027lorinel could hardly draw breath. Drizzt was near. It had to have been that dangerous dark elf who had felled Bathunk.\\n\\n The elf stalked about the room then went out into the corridor, stalking past Bellany\u0027s room and Sheila\u0027s, to the end of the hall and the small chamber where Jule Pepper had set up for the winter.\\n\\n The three women arrived a few moments later, shaking their heads and making off-color jokes about Chogurugga\u0027s antics, with Sheila Kree doing a fair imitation of the crazed ogress.\\n\\n \"Quite an exit,\" Bellany remarked. \"You missed the grandest show of all.\"\\n\\n \"Poor Chogurugga,\" said Jule with a grin.\\n\\n \"Poor Bloog, ye mean,\" Sheila was quick to correct, and the three had a laugh.\\n\\n \"All right, ye best be telling me what ye\u0027re knowing about it,\" Sheila said to Le\u0027lorinel when the elf didn\u0027t join in the mirth, when the elf didn\u0027t crack the slightest of smiles, intensity burning behind those blue and gold orbs.\\n\\n \"I was here when Bathunk was killed, obviously,\" Le\u0027lorinel reminded.\\n\\n Bellany was the first to laugh. \"You know something,\" the sorceress said. \"As soon as you went to Bathunk\u0027s corpse . . .\"\\n\\n \"Ye think it was that damned drow who did it to Bathunk,\" Sheila Kree reasoned.\\n\\n Le\u0027lorinel didn\u0027t answer, other than to keep a perfectly straight, perfectly grim countenance.\\n\\n \"Ye do!\"\\n\\n \"The mountains are a big place, with many dangerous adversaries,\" Jule Pepper put in. \"There are thousands who could have done this to the foolish young ogre.\"\\n\\n Before Le\u0027lorinel could counter, Bellany said, \"Hmm,\" and walked out in front of the other two, one delicate hand up against her pursed lips. \"But you saw the wounds,\" the sorceress reasoned.\\n\\n \"Curving wounds, like the cuts of a scimitar,\" Le\u0027lorinel confirmed\\n\\n \"A sword will cut a wound like that if the target\u0027s falling when he gets it,\" Sheila put in. \"The wounds don\u0027t tell ye as much as ye think.\"\\n\\n \"They tell me all I need to know,\" Le\u0027lorinel replied.\\n\\n \"They were well placed,\" Jule reasoned. \"No novice swordsman cut down Bathunk.\\n\\n \"And I know Chogurugga gave him many of the potions you delivered to her,\" she added to Bellany.\\n\\n That made even Sheila lift her eyebrows in surprise. Bathunk was no ordinary ogre. He was huge, strong, and well trained, and some of those potions were formidable enhancements.\\n\\n \"It was Drizzt,\" Le\u0027lorinel stated with confidence. \"He is nearby and likely on his way to us.\"\\n\\n \"So said the diviner who delivered you here,\" said Bellany, who knew the story well.\\n\\n \"E\u0027kressa the gnome. He sent me to find the mark of Aegis-fang, for that mark would bring Drizzt Do\u0027Urden.\"\\n\\n Jule and Bellany looked to each other, then turned to regard Sheila Kree, who was standing with her head down, deep in thought.\\n\\n \"Could\u0027ve been the soldiers at the tower,\" the pirate leader said at length, \"Could\u0027ve been reinforcements from one of the smaller villages. Could\u0027ve been a wandering band of heroes, or even other monsters, trying to claim the prize the ogres had taken.\"\\n\\n \"Could\u0027ve been Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" interjected Jule, who had firsthand experience with the dangerous drow and his heroic friends.\\n\\n Sheila looked at the tall, willowy woman and nodded, then turned her gaze over Le\u0027lorinel. \"Ye ready for him - if it is him and if he is coming this way?\"\\n\\n The elf stood straight and tall, head back, chest out proudly. \"I have prepared for nothing else in many years.\"\\n\\n \"If he can take down Bathunk, he\u0027ll be a tough fight, don\u0027t ye doubt,\" the pirate leader added.\\n\\n \"We will all be there to aid in the cause,\" Bellany pointed out, but Le\u0027lorinel didn\u0027t seem thrilled at that prospect.\\n\\n \"I know him as well as he knows himself,\" the elf explained. \"If Drizzt Do\u0027Urden comes to us, then he will die.\"\\n\\n \"At the end of your blade,\" Bellany said with a grin.\\n\\n \"Or at the end of his own,\" the ever-cryptic Le\u0027lorinel replied.\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027ll be hoping that it\u0027s Drizzit,\" Sheila agreed. \"But ye canno\u0027 be knowing. The towers in the mountains are well guarded. Many o\u0027 Chogurugga\u0027s kinfolk\u0027ve been killed in going against them, or just in working the roads. Too many soldiers about and too many hero-minded adventurers. Ye canno\u0027 be knowing it\u0027s Drizzt or anyone else.\"\\n\\n Le\u0027lorinel let it go at that. Let Sheila think whatever Sheila wanted to think.\\n\\n Le\u0027lorinel, though, heard again the words of E\u0027kressa.\\n\\n Le\u0027lorinel knew that it was Drizzt, and Le\u0027lorinel was ready. Nothing else - not Sheila, not Drizzt\u0027s friends, not the ogres - mattered. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sea-of-swords-paths-of-darkness-4/page-25.html","bookId":2133,"book":{"id":2133,"title":"Sea of Swords (Paths of Darkness #4)","description":"Storyline: Sea of Swords (Paths of Darkness #4) \\n The mighty warhammer Aegis-fang has found its way into the hands of the wicked pirate captain Sheila Kree, and Wulfgar is hot on her trail.
