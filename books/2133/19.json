{"id":94689,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"The four companions, wearing layers of fur and with blood thickened from years of living in the harshness of Icewind Dale, were not overly bothered by the wintry conditions they found waiting for them not so far north of Luskan. The snow was deep in some places, the trails icy in others, but the group plodded along. Bruenor led Catti-brie and Regis, plowing a trail with his stout body, with Drizzt guiding them from along the side.\n Their progress was wonderful, given the season and the difficult terrain, but of course Bruenor found a reason to grumble. \"Damn twinkly elf don\u0027t even break the crust!\" he muttered, crunching through one snow drift that was more than waist high, while Drizzt skipped along on the crusty surface of the snow, half-skating, half-running. \"Gotta get him to eat more and put some meat on them skinny limbs!\"\n Behind the dwarf, Catti-brie merely smiled. She knew, and so did Bruenor, that Drizzt\u0027s grace was more a measure of balance than of weight. The drow knew how to distribute his weight perfectly, and because he was always balanced, he could shift that weight to his other foot immediately if he felt the snow collapsing beneath him. Catti-brie was about Drizzt\u0027s height and was even a bit lighter than him, but there was no way she could possibly move as he did.\n Because he was atop the snow instead of plowing through it, Drizzt was afforded a fine vantage point of the rolling white lands all around. He noted a trail not far to the side - a recent one, where someone or something had plodded along, much as Bruenor was doing now.\n \"Hold!\" the drow called. Even as he spoke, Drizzt noted another curious sight, that of smoke up ahead, some distance away, rising in a thin line as if from a chimney. He considered it for just a moment, then glanced back to the trail, which seemed to be going in that general direction. He wondered if the two were somehow connected. A trapper\u0027s house, perhaps, or a hermit.\n Figuring that the friends could all use a bit of rest, Drizzt \u0027made good speed for the trail. They had been out from Luskan for nearly a tenday, finding good shelter only twice, once with a farmer the first night and another night spent in a cave.\n Drizzt wasn\u0027t as hopeful for shelter when he arrived at the line in the snow and saw footprints more than twice the size of his own.\n \"What\u0027d\u0027ye got, elf?\" Bruenor called.\n Drizzt motioned for the group to be quiet and for them to come and join him.\n \"Big orcs, perhaps,\" he remarked when they were all there. \"Or small ogres.\"\n \"Or barbarians,\" Bruenor remarked. \"Them folk got the biggest feet I ever seen on a human.\"\n Drizzt examined one clear print more carefully, bending over to put his eyes only a few inches from it. He shook his head. \"These are too heavy, and those who made them wore hard boots, not the doeskin Wulfgar\u0027s people would wear,\" he explained.\n \"Ogres, then,\" said Catti-brie. \"Or big orcs.\"\n \"Plenty of those in these mountains,\" Regis put in.\n \"And heading for that line of smoke,\" Drizzt explained, pointing ahead to the thin plume.\n \"Might be their kinfolk making the smoke,\" Bruenor reasoned. With a wry grin, the dwarf turned to Regis. \"Get to it, Rumblebelly.\"\n Regis branched, thinking then that perhaps he had done too well with that last orc camp, when he and Bruenor were making their way to Luskan. The halfling wasn\u0027t going to shy from his responsibilities, but if these were ogres, he\u0027d be sorely overmatched. And Regis knew that ogres favored halfling as one of their most desired meals.\n When Regis came out of his contemplation, he noted that Drizzt was looking at him, smiling knowingly, as if he\u0027d read the halfling\u0027s every thought.\n \"This is no job for Regis,\" the dark elf said.\n \"He done it on the way to Luskan,\" Bruenor protested. \"Done it well, too.\"\n \"But not in this snow,\" Drizzt replied. \"No thief would be able to find appropriate shadows in this white-out. No, let us go in together to see what friends or enemies we might find.\"\n \"And if they are ogres?\" Catti-brie asked. \"Ye thinking we\u0027re overdue for a fight?\"\n Drizzt\u0027s expression showed clearly that the notion was not an unpleasant one, but he shook his head. \"If they do not concern us, then better that we do not concern them,\" he said. \"But let us learn what we might - it may be that we will find shelter and good food for the night.\"\n Drizzt moved off to the side and a little ahead, and Bruenor led the way along the carved trail. The dwarf brought out his large axe, slapping its handle across his shield hand, and set his one-horned helmet firmly on his head, more than ready for a fight. Behind him, Catti-brie set an arrow to Taulmaril and tested the pull.\n If these were ogres or orcs and they happened to have a decent shelter constructed, then Catti-brie fully expected to be occupying that shelter long before nightfall. She knew Bruenor Battle-hammer too well to think that the dwarf would ever walk away from a fight with either of those beasts.\n \"Yer turn to get the firewood,\" Donbago snarled at his younger brother, Jeddith. He pushed the young man toward the tower door. \"We\u0027ll all be frozen by morning if ye don\u0027t bring it!\"\n \"Yeah, I know,\" the younger soldier grumbled, running a hand through his greasy hair and scratching at some lice. \"Damn weather. Shouldn\u0027t be this cold yet.\"\n The other two soldiers in the stone tower grumbled their agreement. Winter had come early, and with vigor, to the Spine of the World, sweeping down on an icy wind that cut right through the stones of the simple tower fortress to bite at the soldiers. They did have a fire burning in the hearth, but it was getting thin, and they didn\u0027t have enough wood to get through the night. There was plenty to be found, though, so none of them were worried.\n \"If ye help me, we\u0027ll bring enough to get it blazing,\" Jeddith observed, but Donbago grumbled about taking his turn on the tower top watch, and headed for the stairs even as Jeddith started for the outside door.\n A breeze whistling in through the opened door pushed Donbago along as he made the landing to the second floor, to find the other two soldiers of the remote outpost.\n \"Well, who\u0027s up top?\" Donbago scolded.\n \"No one,\" answered one of the pair, scaling the ladder running up from the center of the circular floor to the center of the ceiling. \"The trapdoor\u0027s frozen stuck.\"\n Donbago grumbled and moved to the base of the ladder, watching as his companion for the sentry duty banged at the metal trapdoor. It took them some time to break through the ice, and so Donbago wasn\u0027t on the rooftop and didn\u0027t have to watch helplessly as Jeddith, some thirty feet from the tower door, bent over to retrieve some deadwood, oblivious to the hulking ogre that stepped out from behind a tree and crushed his skull with a single blow from a heavy club.\n Jeddith went down without a sound, and the marauder dragged him out of sight.\n The brute working at the back of the tower was noisier, throwing a grapnel attached to a heavy rope at the tower\u0027s top lip, but its tumult was covered by the banging on the metal trapdoor.\n Before Donbago and his companion had the door unstuck, the half-ogre grabbed the knotted rope in its powerful hands and walked itself right up the nearly thirty feet of the tower wall, heaving itself to the roof.\n The brute turned about, reaching for a large axe it had strapped across its back, even as the door banged open and Donbago climbed through.\n With a roar, the half-ogre leaped at him, but it wound up just bowling the man aside. Fortune was with Donbago, and the half-ogre\u0027s axe got hooked on the heavy strapping. Still, the man went flying down hard against the tower crenellation, his breath blasting away.\n Gasping, Donbago couldn\u0027t even cry out a warning as his companion climbed onto the roof. The half-ogre tore its axe free.\n Donbago winced and grimaced as the brute cut his companion nearly in half. Donbago drew his sword and forced himself to his feet and into a charge. He let his rage be his guide as he closed on the brute, saw his companion, his friend, half out of the trapdoor, squirming in the last moments of his life. A seasoned warrior, Donbago didn\u0027t let the image force him into any rash movements. He came in fast and furiously, but in a tempered manner, launching what looked like a wild swing then retracting the sword just enough so that the brute\u0027s powerful parry whistled past without hitting anything.\n Now Donbago came forward with a stab, and another, driving the brute back and opening its gut.\n The half-ogre wailed and tried to retreat, but lost its footing on the slippery stone and went down hard.\n On came Donbago, leaping forward with a tremendous slash, but even as his sword descended, the half-ogre\u0027s great leg kicked up, connecting solidly and launching the man into a head-over-heels somersault. His blow still landed, though, and the ragged half-ogre had to work hard to regain its footing.\n Donbago was up before it, stabbing and slashing. He kept looking from his target to his dead friend, letting the rage drive him on. Even as the ogre attacked he scored a deep strike. Still, in his offensive stance, he couldn\u0027t get aside, and he took a glancing blow from that awful axe. Then he took a heavy punch in the face, one that shattered his nose, cracked the bones in both his cheeks, and sent him skidding back hard into the wall.\n He slumped there, telling himself that he had to shake the black spots out of his eyes, had to get up and in a defensive posture, telling himself that the brute was falling over him even then, and that he would be crushed and chopped apart.\n With a growl that came from deep in his belly, the dazed and bleeding Donbago forced himself to his feet, his sword before him in a pitiful attempt to ward what he knew would be a killing blow.\n But the half-ogre wasn\u0027t there. It stood, or rather knelt on one knee by the open trapdoor, clutching at its belly, holding in its entrails, the look on its ugly face one of pure incredulity and pure horror.\n Not wanting to wait until the beast decided if the wound was mortal or not, Donbago rushed across the tower top and smashed his sword repeatedly on the half-ogre\u0027s upraised arm. When that arm was at last knocked aside, the man continued to bash with every ounce of strength and energy, again spurred on by the sight of his dead companion and by the sudden fear that his brother -\n His brother!\n Donbago cried out and bashed away, cracking the beast\u0027s skull, knocking it flat to the stone. He bashed away some more, long after the half-ogre stopped moving, turning its ugly head to pulp.\n Then he got up and staggered to the open hatch, trying to pull his torn friend all the way through. When that didn\u0027t work, Donbago pushed the man inside instead, holding him as low as he could so that the fall wouldn\u0027t be too jarring to the torn corpse.\n Sniffling away the horror and the tears, Donbago called out for the others to secure the tower, called out for someone to go and find his brother.\n But he heard the fighting from below and knew that no one was hearing him.\n Without the strength to rush down to join them, Donbago considered his other options and worried, too, that other brutes might be climbing up behind him.\n He started to turn away from the trapdoor and the spectacle of his dead friend in the room below, but stopped as he saw another of the soldiers rush up the stairs to make the landing at the side of the second level.\n \"Ogres!\" the man cried, stumbling for the ladder. He made it to the base, almost, but then a half-ogre appeared on the landing behind him and launched a grapnel secured to a chain. It hooked over the man\u0027s shoulder even as he grabbed the ladder.\n Donbago yelled out and started to go down after him, but with a single mighty jerk, an inhumanly powerful tug, the half-ogre tore the man from the ladder, so instantly, so brutally, that Donbago had to blink away the illusion that the man had simply disappeared.\n Or part of him had, at least, for still holding the ladder below him was the man\u0027s severed arm.\n Donbago looked over to the landing just in time to see the man\u0027s last moments as the half-ogre pummeled him down to the stone floor. Then the brute looked up at Donbago, smiling wickedly.\n The battered Donbago rolled away from the trapdoor and quickly turned the metal portal over and closed it, then rolled on top of it using his body as a locking bar.\n A glance at the dead ogre on the tower top reminded him of his vulnerability up there. Hearing no noise from below other than the distant fighting, Donbago leaped up and ran to the back lip of the tower, pulling free the grapnel. He took it with him as he dived back to cover the trapdoor, pulling the rope up the tower\u0027s side from there.\n A few moment\u0027s later, he felt the first jarring blow from beneath him, a thunderous report that shook the teeth in his mouth.\n Drizzt noted that the tower door was ajar, and noted, too, the crimson stain on the snow near some trees not far away. Then he heard the shout from the tower top.\n He motioned for his friends to be alert and ready, then sprinted off to the side, flanking the tower, trying to get a measure of what was happening and where he would best fit into the battle.\n Catti-brie and Bruenor stayed on the ogre trail, but moved more cautiously then, motioning to Drizzt. To the drow\u0027s surprise, Regis did not remain with the pair. The halfling ran off to the left, flanking the tower the other way. He plowed through the snow, then finally reached a patch of wind-blown stone and sprinted off from shadow to shadow, keeping low and moving swiftly, heading around the back.\n Drizzt couldn\u0027t suppress a grin, thinking that Regis was typically trying to find an out-of-the-way hiding spot.\n That smile went away almost immediately, though, as the drow came to understand that the threat was imminent, that indeed battle was already underway. He saw a man, his tunic and face bloody, sprint out of the open tower door and rush off to the side, screaming for help.\n A hulking form, a large and ugly ogre, chased after him in close pursuit, its already bloody club raised high.\n The man had a few step lead, but that wouldn\u0027t last in the deep snow, Drizzt knew. The ogre\u0027s longer and stronger legs would close the gap fast, and that club. . . .\n Drizzt turned away from the tower in pursuit of the pair. He managed to offer a quick hand signal to Bruenor and Catti-brie, showing them his intent and indicating that they should continue on to the tower. He ran on, his light steps keeping him atop the snow pack.\n At first Drizzt feared that the ogre would get to the fleeing man first, but the man put on a burst of speed and dived headlong over the side of a ridge, tumbling away in the snow.\n The ogre stopped at the ridge, and Drizzt yelled out. The brute seemed more than happy to spin about and fight this newest challenger. Of course, the eager gleam in the ogre\u0027s eye melted away, and the stupid grin became an expression of surprise indeed when the ogre recognized that this newest challenger was not another human, but a drow elf.\n Drizzt went in hard, scimitars whirling, hoping to make a quick kill. Then he could see to the wounded man, and he could get back to the tower and help his friends.\n But this brute was no ordinary ogre. This was a seasoned warrior, nine feet of muscle and bone with the agility to maneuver its heavy spiked club with surprising deftness.\n Drizzt\u0027s eagerness nearly cost him dearly, for as he came ahead, scimitars twirling in oppositional arcs, the quick-footed ogre stepped back just out of range and brought its club across with a tremendous sweep, taking one scimitar along with it. Drizzt was barely able to keep a grip on the weapon. If he\u0027d dropped it, he might never find it in the deep snow.\n Drizzt managed not only to get his second blade, in his right hand, out of the way of the blow, but he got in a stab that bloodied the ogre\u0027s trailing forearm. The brute accepted the sting, though, in exchange for slipping through its real attack. Lifting its heavy leg and following the sweep of the club with a mighty kick, it caught Drizzt on the shoulder and launched him a dozen spinning feet through the air to crash down into the snow.\n The drow recognized his error, then, and was only glad that he had made the error out in the open, where he could fast recover. If he had gotten kicked like that inside the tower, he figured he\u0027d now be little more than a red stain on the stone wall.\n They saw the drow\u0027s signal, but neither Bruenor nor Catti-brie were about to abandon Drizzt as he chased off after the ogre - until they heard the cry for help, as pitiful a wail as either had ever heard, coming from inside the tower.\n \"Ye keep yer damned shots higher than me head!\" Bruenor yelled to his girl, and the dwarf bent his shoulders low and rambled on for the tower door, gaining speed, momentum, and fury.\n Catti-brie worked hard to keep up, just a few feet behind, Taulmaril in hand, leveled and ready.\n There was nothing subtle or quiet about the dwarfs charge, and predictably, Bruenor was met at the doorway by another hulking form. The dwarf\u0027s axe chopped hard. Catti-brie\u0027s arrow slammed the brute in the chest. Those two blows, combined with the sturdy dwarf\u0027s momentum, got Bruenor crashing into the main area of the tower\u0027s lowest floor.\n This opponent, a half-ogre and a tough one at that, wasn\u0027t finished. It managed a counterstrike with its club, bouncing a mighty hit off Bruenor\u0027s shoulder.\n \"Ye got to do better than that!\" the dwarf bellowed, though in truth, the blow hurt.\n Smiling in spite of the pain, Bruenor swiped his axe across. The half-ogre stumbled out of reach but came back forward for a counter too soon. Bruenor\u0027s backhand caught it flat against the ribs, stealing its momentum and its intended attack.\n The half-ogre staggered, giving Bruenor the time to set his feet properly and begin again. The next hit wasn\u0027t with the flat of the axe, but with the jagged, many-notched head, a swipe that cut a slice right down the battered brute\u0027s chest.\n Before Bruenor could begin to celebrate the apparent victory, though, a second half-ogre leaped out from the stairway, slamming into its mortally wounded companion and taking both of them crashing over Bruenor, burying the dwarf beneath nearly a ton of flesh and bone.\n The dwarf needed Catti-brie sorely at that point, but a call from above told him that, perhaps, so did someone else.\n At the back of the tower, in close to the base of the wall and listening intently, Regis heard Bruenor\u0027s charge. He didn\u0027t have any great urge to go around with the dwarf, though, for Bruenor\u0027s tactics were straightforward, muscle against muscle, trading punch for punch.\n Joining in that strategy against ogres, Regis wouldn\u0027t last beyond the first blow.\n A cry from above jarred the halfling. He started to climb hand over hand, picking holds in the cold, cracked stone. By the time he was halfway up, his poor fingers were scraped and bleeding, but he kept going, moving with deceiving swiftness, picking his holds expertly and nearing the top.\n He heard a yell and a crash, then some heavy scuffling. Up he went with all speed, and he nearly slipped and fell, catching himself at the very last moment - and with more than a little luck.\n Finally he put his hand on the lip of the tower top and peeked over. What he saw almost made him want to leap right off.\n Poor Donbago, crying out repeatedly, only wanted to hold the I portal shut, to close his eyes and will all of this horror away. He was a seasoned fighter and had seen many battles and had lost many friends.\n But not his brother.\n He knew in his heart that Jeddith was down, and likely dead.\n He knew in his heart that the tower was lost, and that there would be no escape. Perhaps if he just lay there long enough, using his body to block the trapdoor, the brutes would go away. He knew, after all, that ogres were not known for persistence or for cunning.\n Most were not, at least.\n Donbago hardly noticed the warmth at first, though he did smell the burning leather. He didn\u0027t understand - until a sharp pain erupted in his back. Reflexively, the man rolled, but he stopped at once, realizing that he had to hold the door shut.\n He tried going back, but the metal was hot - so hot!\n The ogres below must have been heating it with torches.\n Donbago jumped atop the door, hoping his boots would insulate him from the heat. He heard a scream as one of his companions exited the tower, and, a few moments later, a roar from below, by the front door.\n He was hopping, his boots smoking. He looked around frantically, searching for something he could use to place over the door, a loose stone in the crenellation, perhaps.\n He went flying away as an ogre below leveled a tremendous blow to the door. A second strike, before Donbago could scramble back, had the portal bouncing open. A brute came through with amazing speed, obviously boosted to the roof by a companion.\n Donbago, waves of pain still spreading from his broken face, leaped into the fray immediately and furiously, thinking of his brother with every mad strike. He scored a couple of hits on the ogre, which seemed truly surprised by his ferocity, but then its companion was up beside it. Two heavy clubs swatted at him, back and forth.\n He ducked, he dodged, he didn\u0027t even try to parry the too-powerful blows, and his desperate offensive posture allowed him to manage another serious stab at the first brute, sending it sprawling to the stone.\n Donbago got hit, knocked to his back, his sword flying, and before he even realized what had happened, the valiant soldier felt a strong hand grab his ankle.\n In an instant, he was scooped aloft, hanging upside down at the end of a mighty ogre\u0027s arm.\n Drizzt rolled across the snow, not fighting the momentum but enhancing it, allowing the ogre\u0027s kick to take him as far from his formidable opponent as possible. He wanted to get up and face the ogre squarely, to take a better measure and put this fight back on more recognizable ground. He believed that his underestimation of his opponent alone had cost him that hit, that he had erred greatly.\n He was surprised again when he at last tucked his feet under him and started to rise, to find that the ogre had kept up with him and was even then coming in for another furious attack.\n The brute was moving too fast - too far beyond what Drizzt, no novice to battling ogres, would have expected from one of its lumbering kind.\n In came the club, swatting down to the left, forcing the drow to dodge right. The ogre halted the swing quickly and put the club up and over, taking it up in both hands like someone splitting wood might, and slamming it straight down at the new position Drizzt was settling into, with more force than one of Drizzt\u0027s stature could possibly hope to block or even deflect.\n Drizzt dived into a roll back to the left, coming up facing to the side and rushing fast in retreat, putting some ground between himself and the brute. He spun at the ready, almost expecting this surprising foe to be upon him once again.\n This time, though, the ogre had remained in place. It grinned as it regarded Drizzt, then pulled a ceramic flask from its belt - a belt that already showed several open loops, Drizzt noted - and popped it into its mouth, chewing it up to get at the potion.\n Almost immediately, the ogre\u0027s arms began to bulge with heightened strength, with the strength of a great giant.\n Drizzt actually felt better now that he had sorted out the riddle. The ogre had taken a potion of speed, obviously, and now one of strength, and likely others of enhancing magical properties. Now the drow understood, and now the drow could better anticipate.\n Drizzt lamented that Guenhwyvar had been with him the night before, that he had used up the magic of the figurine for the time being. He could not recall the panther, and now, it seemed, he could use the help.\n In came the ogre, swatting its club all about, howling with rage and with the anticipation of this sweet kill. Drizzt had to drop low to his knees, else that victory would have come quickly for the brute.\n But now Drizzt had a plan. The ogre was moving more quickly than it was used to moving, and its great strength would send its club out with tremendous, often unbreakable momentum. Drizzt could use that against the beast, perhaps, could utilize misdirection as a way of having the ogre off-balance and with apparent openings.\n Up came the drow, skittering to the side - or seeming to - then cutting back and rushing straight ahead, scoring a solid hit on the ogre\u0027s leg as he waded past.\n He continued and dived ahead, turning as he came up to face his foe, expecting to see the blood turning bright red near that torn leg.\n The ogre was hardly bleeding, as if something other than its skin had absorbed the bulk of that wicked scimitar strike.\n Drizzt\u0027s mind whirled through the possibilities. There were potions, he had heard, that could do such things, potions offering varying degrees of added heroism.\n \"Ah, Guen,\" the drow lamented, for he knew that he was in for quite a fight.\n The dwarf wondered if he would simply suffocate under the press of the two heavy bodies, particularly the dead weight of the one he had defeated. He squirmed and tucked his legs, then worked to find some solid footing and pushed ahead with all his strength, his short, bunched muscles straining mightily.\n He got his head out from under the fallen brute\u0027s hip, but then had to duck right back underneath as the second brute, still lying atop the dying one, slapped down at him with a powerful grasping hand.\n The ogre finger-walked that hand underneath in pursuit of the dwarf, and with his own arms still pinned down beside him, Bruenor couldn\u0027t match the grab.\n So he bit the hand instead, latching on like an angry dog, gnashing his teeth, and crunching the brute\u0027s knuckles.\n The half-ogre howled and pulled back, but the dwarf\u0027s mighty jaw remained clamped. Bruenor held on ferociously. The brute crawled off its dying companion, twisting about to gain some leverage, then lifted the fallen ogre\u0027s hip and tugged hard, pulling the dwarf out on the end of its arm.\n The brute lifted its other arm to smack at the dwarf, but once free, Bruenor didn\u0027t hesitate. He grabbed the trapped forearm in both hands and, still biting hard, ran straight back, turning about and twisting the arm as he went behind the half-ogre.\n \"Got one for ye!\" the dwarf yelled, finally releasing his bite, for he had the half-ogre off-balance then, momentarily helpless and lined up for the open doorway. Bruenor drove ahead with all his strength and leverage, forcing the brute into a quick-step. With a great heave, the dwarf got the brute to the doorway and through it.\n Where Catti-brie\u0027s arrow met it, square in the chest.\n The half-ogre staggered backward, or started to, for as soon as he had let the thing go, Bruenor quick-stepped back a few steps, rubbed his heavy boots on the stone for traction, and rushed forward, leaping as the half-ogre staggered back to slam hard into the brute\u0027s lower back.\n The brute stumbled out through the door, where another arrow hit it hard in the chest.\n It fell to its knees grasping at the two shafts with trembling hands.\n Catti-brie shot it again, right in the face.\n \"More on the stairs!\" Bruenor yelled out to her. \"Come on, girl, I need ye!\"\n Catti-brie started forward, ready to rush right in past the brute she had just felled, but then came another cry from above. She looked up to see a squirming, whimpering man hanging out over the tower\u0027s edge, a huge half-ogre holding him by the ankles.\n Up came Taulmaril, leveling at the brute\u0027s face, for Catti-brie figured that the man might well survive the fall into the snow, which was piled pretty deep on this side of the tower, but knew that he had no chance of surviving his current captor.\n But the half-ogre saw her as well, and, with a wicked grin, brought up its own weapon - a huge club - and lined up for a hit that would surely break the squirming man apart.\n Catti-brie reflexively cried out.\n At the back of the tower top, Regis heard that cry. Looking that way he understood that the poor soldier was in a precarious predicament. But the halfling couldn\u0027t get to the brute in time, and even if he did, what could he and his tiny mace do against something of that monster\u0027s bulk?\n The second half-ogre, wounded by the soldier\u0027s valiant fight but not down, was on the move again to join its companion. It rushed across the tower top, oblivious to the halfling peering over the rim.\n Purely on instinct - if he had thought about it, the halfling would have more likely simply passed out from fear than made the move - Regis pulled himself over the lip and scrambled forward half running, half diving, skidding low right between the running half-ogre\u0027s leading heel and trailing toe.\n The brute tripped up, its kick as it stumbled forward jolting and battering the poor halfling and lifting Regis into a short flight.\n Out of control, the half-ogre gained momentum, falling headlong into its companion\u0027s broad back.\n Catti-brie saw no choice but to take her chances on the shot, much as she had done against the pirate holding Delly in Captain Deudermont\u0027s house.\n The half-ogre apparently anticipated just that and delayed its swing at the man and ducked back instead, the arrow streaking harmlessly into the air before it.\n Catti-brie winced, thinking the man surely doomed. Before she could even reach to set another arrow, though, the half-ogre came forward suddenly, way over the tower lip. It let go of the man, who dropped, screaming, into the snow. It too went over, hands flailing helplessly.\n Gasping for his lost breath, his ribs sorely bruised, the battered halfling struggled to his feet and faced the half-ogre he had tripped even as the brute turned to regard him ominously. Its look was one of pure menace, promising a horrible death.\n With a growl, it took a long step toward the halfling.\n Regis considered his little mace, a perfectly insignificant weapon against the sheer mass and strength of this brute, then sighed and tossed it to the ground. With a tip of his hood, the halfling turned around and ran for the back of the tower, crying out with every running step. He understood the drop over that lip. It was a good thirty feet, and the back side of the tower, unlike the front, was nearly clear, wind-blown stone.\n Still, the halfling never slowed. He leaped up and rolled over the edge. Without slowing, roaring in rage with every step, the half-ogre dived over right behind.\n The lower vantage point for Bruenor proved an advantage as he charged at the half-ogre standing on the curving stairway. The brute slammed its club straight down at the dwarf but Bruenor got his fine shield - emblazoned with the \"foaming mug\" standard of Clan Battlehammer - up over his head and angled perfectly. The dwarf was strong enough of arm to accept and deflect the blow.\n The half-ogre wasn\u0027t as fortunate against the counter, a mighty sweep of Bruenor\u0027s fine axe that cracked the brute\u0027s ankle, snapping bone and digging a deep, deep gash. The half-ogre howled in pain and reached down reflexively to grab at the torn limb. Bruenor moved against the wall and leaped up three steps, putting him one above the bending half-ogre. The dwarf turned and braced, planting his shield against the brute as it started to turn to face him. Bruenor shoved out with all his strength, his short, muscled legs driving hard.\n The half-ogre went off the stairs. It wasn\u0027t a long fall, but one that proved disastrous, for as the brute tried to hold its balance it landed hard on the broken ankle. It fell over on its side with a howl.\n Its blurry vision cleared a moment later, and it looked back to see a flying red-bearded dwarf coming its way, mouth opened in a primal roar, face twisted with eager rage, and that devilish axe gripped in both hands.\n The dwarf snapped his body as he impacted, driving the axe in hard and heavy, cleaving the half-ogre\u0027s head in half.\n \"Bet that hurt,\" Bruenor grumbled, pulling himself to his feet.\n He looked at the gore on his axe and winced, then just shrugged and wiped it on the dead beast\u0027s dirty fur tunic.\n Drizzt skittered back against a tree, then ducked and rolled around it to avoid a thundering smash.\n The ogre\u0027s club smacked hard against the young tree and proved the stronger, cracking the living wood apart.\n Drizzt groaned aloud as he considered the toppling tree, picturing what his own slender form might have looked like had he not dodged aside. He had no time to ponder at length, though, for the ogre, moving with enhanced speed and wielding its heavy club with ease with its giant-strength muscles, was fast in pursuit. It leaped the falling tree and swung again.\n Drizzt fell to the snow flat on his face, the club whistling right above him. With amazing speed and grace, the drow put his legs under him and leaped straight up over the ogre\u0027s fast backhand, which came down diagonally from the side to smack the spot where Drizzt had just been lying. In the air, the drow had little weight behind the strikes, but he worked his scimitars in rapid alternating stabs, popping their points into the ogre\u0027s broad chest.\n The drow landed lightly and went right back into the air, twisting as he did so that he rolled over the side-cutting club. As he landed he reversed the momentum of his somersault and drove one blade hard into the ogre\u0027s belly. Again, he didn\u0027t score nearly as much of a wound as he would have expected, but he didn\u0027t pause to lament the fact. He spun around the ogre\u0027s hip, reversed his grip on the blade in his right hand, and stabbed it out and hard into the back of the ogre\u0027s treelike leg.\n Drizzt sprinted straight ahead, leaping another fallen tree and spinning around a pair of oaks, turning to face his predictably charging opponent.\n The ogre chased him around the two oaks, but Drizzt held an advantage, for he could cut between the close-growing trees while the huge brute had to circle both. He went to the outside through a couple of rotations, letting the ogre fall into a set pace, then darted between the trees and came around fast and hard before the brute could properly turn and set its defenses.\n Again the drow scored a pair of hits, one a stab, the other a slash. As he came across with his right hand, he followed through with the motion, turning a complete circle then sprinting ahead once more, the howling ogre in fast pursuit.\n And so it went for many minutes, Drizzt using a hit and retreat strategy, hoping to tire the ogre, hoping that the potions, likely temporary enhancements, would run their course.\n Drizzt scored again and again with minor hits, but he knew that this was no contest of finesse, where the better fighter would be awarded the victory by some neutral judges. This was a battle to the end, and while he looked beautiful with his precision movements and strikes, the only hit that would matter would be the last one. Given the ogre\u0027s sheer power, given the images burned into the drow\u0027s mind as yet another tree splintered and toppled under the weight of the brute\u0027s blow, Drizzt understood that the first solid hit he took from the creature would likely be the last hit of the fight.\n The drow went full speed over one snowy ridge, diving down in a roll on his back and sliding to the bottom. He came up fast, spinning to face the pursuit. The drow was looking to score another hit, perhaps, or more likely, in this unfavorable place, to simply run away.\n But the ogre wasn\u0027t there, and Drizzt understood that it had used its heightened speed and heightened strength in a different manner when he heard the brute touch down behind him.\n The ogre had leaped off the top of the ridge, right over the sliding and turning drow.\n Drizzt realized his mistake.\n The surprised half-ogre landed flat on its back a few feet out from the tower and from the captive it had dropped, but was moving immediately, hardly seeming hurt, scrambling to its feet.\n Catti-brie led her charge with another streaking arrow, a gut shot, then she threw her bow aside and drew out Khazid\u0027hea. The eager sword telepathically prompted her to cut the beast apart.\n The brute clutched at its belly wound with one hand and reached out at her with the other, as if to try to catch her charge. The flash of Khazid\u0027hea ended that possibility, sending stubby fingers flying all about.\n Catti-brie went in with fury, taking the advantage and never offering it back, slashing her fine-edged sword to and fro and hardly slowing enough to even bother to line up her strikes.\n She didn\u0027t have to; not with this sword.\n The half-ogre\u0027s heavy clothing and hide armor parted as if it was thin paper, and bright lines of red striped the creature in a matter of moments.\n The half-ogre managed one punch out at her, but Khazid\u0027hea was there, intercepting the punch with its sharp edge, splitting the half-ogre\u0027s hand and riding that cut right up through its thick wrist.\n How the beast howled!\n But that cry was silenced a moment later when Catti-brie slashed Khazid\u0027hea across up high, taking out the brute\u0027s throat. Down went the half-ogre, and Catti-brie leaped beside it, her sword slashing repeatedly.\n \"Girl!\" Bruenor cried, half in terror and half in surprise when he exited the tower to see his adopted daughter covered in blood. He ran to her and nearly got cut in half as she swung around, Khazid\u0027hea flashing.\n \"It\u0027s the damn sword!\" Bruenor cried at her, falling back and throwing his arms up defensively.\n Catti-brie stopped suddenly, staring at her fine blade with shock.\n Bruenor was right. In her moment of anger and terror at seeing the man fall from the tower, in her moment of guilt blaming herself for the man\u0027s fall because of her missed bowshot, the viciously sentient sword Khazid\u0027hea had found its way into her thoughts yet again, prodding her into a frenzy.\n She laughed aloud, helplessly. Her white teeth looked ridiculous, shining out from her bloodied face. She slapped the sword\u0027s blade down into the snow.\n \"Girl?\" Bruenor asked cautiously.\n \"I\u0027m thinking that we could both use a bath,\" Catti-brie said to him, obviously in control again.\n Regis, hanging on the edge of the tower top, wondered if the half-ogre even understood its mistake as it flew out over him, limbs flailing wildly on its fast descent to the stony ground. The brute hit with a muffled groan, and bounced once or twice.\n The halfling pulled himself back over the tower top and looked down to see the half-ogre stubbornly trying to regain its footing. It stumbled once and went back down, but then tried to rise again.\n Regis retrieved his little mace and took aim. He whistled down to the half-ogre as he let fly, timing it perfectly so that the brute looked up just in time to catch the falling weapon right in the face. There came a sharp report, like metal hitting stone, and the half-ogre stood there for a long while, staring up at Regis.\n The halfling sucked in his breath, hardly believing that the mace, falling from thirty feet, hadn\u0027t done more damage.\n But it had. The brute went down hard and didn\u0027t get up.\n A shiver coursed up Regis\u0027s little spine, and he paused long enough to consider his actions in this battle, to consider that he had gotten involved at all when he really didn\u0027t have to. The halfling tried very hard not to look at things that way, tried to remind himself repeatedly that he had acted in accordance with the tenets of his group of friends, his dear, trusted companions, who would risk their lives without a second thought to help those in dire need.\n Not for the first time, and not for the last, Regis wondered if he would be better off finding a new group of friends.\n Drizzt could only guess from which direction the ogre\u0027s mighty swing would come, and he understood that if he guessed wrong, he\u0027d be leaping right into the oncoming blow. In the split second he had to react, it all sorted out, his warrior instincts replaying the ogre\u0027s fighting style, telling him clearly that the ogre had initiated every attack with a right-to-left strike.\n So Drizzt went left, his magical anklets speeding his feet into a desperate run.\n And the club swatted in behind him, clipping him as he turned and leaped, launching him into a long, twisting tumble. The snow padded his fall, but when he came up he found that he was only holding one scimitar. His right arm had gone completely numb and his shoulder and side were exploding with pain. The drow glanced down and winced. His shoulder had clearly been dislocated, pushed back from its normal position.\n Drizzt didn\u0027t have long, for the ogre was coming on in pursuit - though, the drow noted with some hope, not as quickly as it had been moving.\n Drizzt skittered away, turning as he went and literally throwing himself backward into a tree, using the solidity of the tree to pop his shoulder back into place. The wave of agony turned his stomach and brought black spots spinning before his eyes. He nearly swooned, but knew that if he gave into that momentary weakness, the ogre would break him apart.\n He rolled around the tree and stumbled away, buying himself more time. He knew then, by how easily he could distance himself from the brute, that at least one of the potions had worn off.\n Every step was bringing some measure of relief to Drizzt. The ache in his shoulder had lessened already, and he found that he could feel his fingers again. He took a circuitous route that led him back to his fallen scimitar, with the dumb ogre, apparently thinking that it had the fight won, following fast in pursuit.\n Drizzt stopped and turned, his lavender eyes boring into the approaching brute. Just before the combatants came together, their gazes met, and the ogre\u0027s confidence melted away.\n There would be no underestimation by the dark elf this time.\n Drizzt came ahead in a fury, holding the ogre\u0027s stare with his own. His scimitars worked as if of their own accord, in perfect harmony and with blazing speed - too quickly for the ogre, its magical speed worn away and its giant strength diminishing, to possibly keep up. The brute tried to take an offensive posture instead, swinging wildly, but Drizzt was behind it before it ever completed the blow. That other potion, the one that had someone made the ogre resistant to the drow\u0027s scimitar stings, was also dissipating.\n This time, both Twinkle and Icingdeath dug in, one taking a kidney, the other hamstringing the brute.\n Drizzt worked in a fury but with controlled precision, rushing all around his opponent, stabbing and slashing, and always at a vital area.\n The victorious drow put his scimitars away soon after, his right arm going numb again now that the adrenaline of battle was subsiding. Swaying with every step, and cursing himself for taking such an enemy as that for granted, he made his way back to the tower. There he found Bruenor and Regis sitting by the open door, both looking battered, and Catti-brie covered head to toe in blood, standing nearby, tending to a dazed and wounded man.\n \"A fine thing it\u0027ll be if we all wind up killed to death in battle afore we ever get to the pirate Kree,\" Bruenor grumbled. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sea-of-swords-paths-of-darkness-4/page-19.html","bookId":2133,"book":{"id":2133,"title":"Sea of Swords (Paths of Darkness #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Sea of Swords (Paths of Darkness #4) \n The mighty warhammer Aegis-fang has found its way into the hands of the wicked pirate captain Sheila Kree, and Wulfgar is hot on her trail.
