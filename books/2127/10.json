{"id":94064,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\"Goblins?\" Regis asked. Drizzt bent low over one of the dwarven corpses, shaking his head even before he got close enough to fully inspect the wounds. Goblins would not likely have left the dwarves in this condition, the drow ranger knew, certainly not with all of their valuable armor and equipment intact. Besides, goblins never recovered the bodies of their own dead, yet the only kills in this corridor were dwarves. No matter how large the goblin force, and how great their advantage of surprise, Drizzt did not think it likely that they could have killed this sturdy party without a single loss.\\n\\n The wounds on the nearest dwarf seemed to confirm the drow\u0027s instincts. Slender and precise, these cuts were not made by crude, jagged goblin weapons. A fine edge, razor sharp and probably enchanted, had sliced this particular dwarf\u0027s throat. The line was barely visible, even after Drizzt had wiped away the blood, but ultimately deadly.\\n\\n \"What killed them?\" Regis asked, growing impatient. He shifted about from foot to foot, moving the torch alternately from one hand to the other.\\n\\n Drizzt\u0027s mind refused to accept the obvious conclusion. How many times in his years in Menzoberranzan, fighting beside his drow kin, had Drizzt Do\u0027Urden witnessed wounds similar to these? No other race in all the Realms, with the possible exception of the surface elves, used weapons so finely edged.\\n\\n \"What killed them?\" Regis asked again, a notable tremor in his voice.\\n\\n Drizzt shook his white locks. \"I do not know,\" he replied honestly. He moved to the next body, this one slumped, half-sitting against the wall. Despite the abundance of blood, the only wound the drow found was a single clean, diagonal slash along the right side of the unfortunate dwarf\u0027s throat, a cut paper thin but very deep.\\n\\n \"It could be Duergar,\" Drizzt said to Regis, referring to the evil race of gray dwarves. The thought made sense, since Duergar had served as minions to Shimmergloom the dragon, and had inhabited these halls until just a few months before, when Bruenor\u0027s forces had chased them out. Still, Drizzt knew that his reasoning was based more in hope than in truth. Greedy Duergar would have stripped these victims clean, particularly of the valuable mining equipment, and Duergar, like mountain dwarves, favored heavier weapons, such as the battle-axe. No such weapon had hit this dwarf.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t believe that,\" Regis said behind him. Drizzt didn\u0027t turn to regard the halfling; staying in a crouch, he shuffled over to the next unfortunate dwarf.\\n\\n Regis\u0027s voice fell away behind him, but Drizzt heard the halfling\u0027s last statement as clearly as he had ever heard anything in his life.\\n\\n \"You think Entreri did it.\"\\n\\n Drizzt did not think that, did not think that any lone warrior, however skilled, could possibly have done such a complete and precise job. He glanced back at Regis, standing impassively under his upheld torch, his eyes searching Drizzt for some clue of a reaction. Drizzt thought the halfling\u0027s reasoning curious indeed, and the only explanation he could think of was that Regis was terribly frightened that Entreri had followed him out of Calimport.\\n\\n Drizzt shook his head and turned back to his investigation. On the body of the third dwarf he found a clue that narrowed the list of potential killers to one race.\\n\\n A tiny dart protruded from the body\u0027s side, under its cloak. Drizzt had to take a steadying breath before he mustered the nerve to pull it out, for he recognized it, and it explained the ease with which these toughened dwarves had been slaughtered. The quarrel, made for a hand-held crossbow, undoubtedly had been coated with sleep poison and was a favored missile of dark elves.\\n\\n Drizzt came up from his low crouch; his scimitars leaped into his slender hands. \"We must leave this place,\" he whispered harshly.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Regis asked.\\n\\n Drizzt, his keen senses attuned to the darkness farther along the corridor, did not answer.\\n\\n From somewhere back behind the halfling, Guenhwyvar issued a low growl.\\n\\n Drizzt eased one foot behind him and slid slowly backward, somehow understanding that any abrupt movement would trigger an attack. Dark elves in Mithril Hall! Of all the horrors Drizzt could think of - and in Faerun, these were countless - not one came near to the disaster of the drow.\\n\\n \"Which way?\" Regis whispered.\\n\\n Twinkle\u0027s blue light seemed to flare.\\n\\n \"Go!\" Drizzt cried, understanding the scimitar\u0027s warning He spun about and saw Regis for just a moment, then the halfling disappeared under a ball of conjured darkness, the magic snuffing out the light of the halfling\u0027s torch in the blink of an eye.\\n\\n Drizzt rolled to the side of the corridor and spun back around behind the propped body of a dead dwarf. He closed his eyes, forcing them into the infrared spectrum, and felt the dwarf\u0027s body jerk slightly, once and then again. Drizzt knew it had been hit with quarrels.\\n\\n A black streak emerged from the globe of darkness behind him; the corridor brightened just a bit as Regis apparently went out the back side of the darkened area, his torch shedding some light around the edge of the unyielding globe.\\n\\n The halfling did not cry out, though. This surprised Drizzt and made him fear that Regis had been taken.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar padded by him and darted left, then right. A poison-coated quarrel skipped off the stone floor, inches from the panther\u0027s fast-moving paws. Another struck Guenhwyvar with a thud, but the cat hardly slowed.\\n\\n Drizzt saw the heated outlines of two slender forms many yards away, each with a single arm extended, as though they were again taking aim with their wicked weapons. Drizzt called upon his own innate magical abilities and dropped a globe of darkness into the corridor ahead of Guenhwyvar, offering some cover. Then he, too, was up and running, following the cat, hoping that Regis somehow had escaped.\\n\\n He went into his own area of darkness without slowing, sure-footed, remembering the layout of the corridor perfectly and deftly skipping over yet another dwarven body. When he emerged, Drizzt noticed the black mouth of a side passage to his left. Guenhwyvar had flown right past it, and now was bearing down on the two drow forms, but Drizzt, trained in the tactics of the dark elves, knew in his heart that the side passage could not be clear.\\n\\n He heard a scuttling noise, as of many hard-edged legs, and then he fell back, stunned and afraid, as an eight-legged monstrosity, half drow and half arachnid, clambered around the bend, its legs catching hold with equal ease on both floor and wall. Twin axes waved ominously in its hands, which once had been the delicate hands of a drow.\\n\\n In all the wide world, there was nothing more repulsive to any dark elf, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden included, than a drider.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar\u0027s roar, accompanied by the sounds of several clicking crossbows, brought Drizzt back to his senses in time to deflect the drider\u0027s first attack. The monster came straight in with its front legs raised and kicking - to keep Drizzt off balance - and launched its axes in a quick double chop at Drizzt\u0027s head.\\n\\n Drizzt spun back out of range of the legs in time to avoid the slicing axes, but instead of continuing his retreat, he hooked an arm on one spidery leg and rolled around it, rushing back in. Twinkle whipped across, blasting aside a second leg and giving Drizzt enough of an opening to slide down to his knees, right under the beast.\\n\\n The drider reared and hissed, both of its axes chopping at Drizzt\u0027s backside.\\n\\n Drizzt\u0027s other scimitar was already in place, though, leveled horizontally in back of his vulnerable neck. It deflected one axe harmlessly wide and caught the other where its head met its handle. Drizzt put his feet under him and turned sideways as he rose, both his blades turning point up. With his parrying scimitar, he continued the movement, twisting the trapped axe right over in the drider\u0027s hand, then tugging it free. With Twinkle he thrust straight up, finding a ridge in the creature\u0027s armored exoskeleton and sinking the blade deep into spidery flesh. Hot fluids gushed over Drizzt\u0027s arm; the drider shrieked in agony and twitched violently.\\n\\n Legs buffeted Drizzt from every side. He nearly lost his grip on Twinkle and had to pull the blade out to keep hold i of it. Through his prison bars of spider legs Drizzt noticed more dark forms emerging from the side corridor, drow elves, he knew, each with one arm extended his way.\\n\\n He spun frantically as the first one fired. His thick cloak luckily floated out behind him and caught the quarrel ! harmlessly in its heavy folds. When he ended his desperate I maneuver, though, Drizzt found that he was half out from j under the drider, and the creature had turned about enough | to line him up with its remaining axe. Even worse, the second drow had him solidly targeted in crossbow sights.\\n\\n The axe came down curiously - flat end leading, Drizzt noted - forcing Drizzt to parry. He expected to hear the click of a firing crossbow, but Drizzt heard instead a muffled groan as six hundred pounds of black panther | buried his dark elf attacker.\\n\\n Drizzt slapped the axe aside with one blade, then the other, buying himself enough time to get out the rest of the way. He came up, instinctively spinning away from the J drider, just in time to get his weapons up to block a sword thrust from the closest drow enemy.\\n\\n \"Drop your weapons and it will go easier on you!\" the, drow, holding two fine swords, cried in a language that Drizzt had not heard in more than a decade, a language that sent images of beautiful, twisted, terrible Menzoberranzan flowing back into his mind. How many tunes had Zaknafein, his father, stood before him, similarly armed, awaiting their inevitable sparring tournament?\\n\\n A growl that he was not even cognizant of escaped Drizzt\u0027s lips; he went into a series of offensive combinations that left his opponent dazzled and off balance in a split second. A scimitar came in low to the side, the second came in high, straight ahead, and the first chopped in again, angled downward at shoulder level.\\n\\n The enemy drow\u0027s eyes widened as if he had suddenly realized his doom.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar shot by them both, hit the drider full on, and went tumbling in a black ball of raking claws and flailing spider legs.\\n\\n More dark elves were coming, Drizzt knew, from farther ahead and from the side passage. Drizzt\u0027s fury did not relent. Twinkle and his other blade worked fiercely, preventing the other drow from beginning an offensive counter.\\n\\n He found an opening level with the drow\u0027s neck but had no heart for a kill. This was no goblin he faced, but a drow, one of his own race, one like Zaknafein, perhaps. Drizzt remembered a vow he had made when he had left the dark elf city. Ignoring the opening for the drow\u0027s neck, he whipped his blade low instead, banging one of his opponent\u0027s swords. Twinkle followed the attack immediately, slamming at the same sword, then Drizzt\u0027s first blade whipped back the other way, hitting the weapon on the opposite side and sending the battered thing flying away. The evil drow fell back, then came in low, hoping to counter quickly enough with his remaining sword to push Drizzt back, that he might recover his lost weapon.\\n\\n A blinding backhand from Twinkle sent that remaining sword flying out wide, and Drizzt, never doubting the effectiveness of his strike, was moving forward before Twinkle ever connected.\\n\\n He could have hit the drow anywhere he chose, including a dozen critical areas, but Drizzt Do\u0027Urden recalled again the vow he had made when he had left Menzoberranzan, a promise to himself and a justification of his departure, that he would never again take the life of one of his people.\\n\\n His scimitar jabbed downward, angling in above his opponent\u0027s kneecap. The evil drow howled and fell back, rolling to the stone and grasping at his torn joint.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar was under the standing drider, the muscles of the panther\u0027s flank exposed from under a loose-hanging piece of the cat\u0027s black-furred skin.\\n\\n \"Go, Guenhwyvar!\" Drizzt shouted as he ran along the wall, leaping wildly, hacking away, into the jumble of drider legs on that side. He heard the monstrosity shriek again as a scimitar blasted deep into one leg, nearly severing it, and then he tumbled free, out the back side.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar took another axe hit but did not respond, did not follow Drizzt or counter the attack.\\n\\n \"Guenhwyvar!\" Drizzt called, and the panther\u0027s head turned slowly to regard him. Drizzt understood the panther\u0027s delay when Guenhwyvar flinched several more times from continued crossbow hits.\\n\\n Drizzt\u0027s instincts told him to send the panther away before any more punishment could be leveled upon it - but he did not have the figurine!\\n\\n \"Guenhwyvar!\" he cried again, seeing many forms closing quickly from beyond the drider. Truly torn, Drizzt decided to rush back in and fight beside the panther to the bitter end.\\n\\n The eight-legged creature hissed victoriously as its axe lined up for a stroke on the helpless and quivering panther\u0027s neck. Down came the blade, but it hit only insubstantial mist, and the drider\u0027s cry turned to one of frustration.\\n\\n \"Come on!\" Drizzt heard Regis say behind him. The ranger understood then and was relieved.\\n\\n But then the drider turned on him fully, and for the first time, with the torchlight returned to this area of the tunnel, Drizzt got a good look at the creature\u0027s unnervingly familiar face.\\n\\n He had not the time to stop to consider it, though. He swept about, exaggerating the movement to send his cloak flying wide (and it took yet another quarrel that had been diving for his back), and rushed away.\\n\\n The corridor darkened immediately, then lightened a bit, then darkened again, as Regis went into and through the two globes of darkness. Drizzt dove to the side as soon as he went into the cover of his own globe, and he heard a quarrel skip off the stone not far away. In full stride, he caught Regis just beyond the second globe, and the two flew past the dwarven bodies, cut around the bend in the corridor, and kept on running, Drizzt leading the way. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-10.html","bookId":2127,"book":{"id":2127,"title":"The Legacy (Legacy of the Drow #1)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #1: The Legacy \\n A new mass market edition of the New York Times best-selling sword and sorcery classic, The Legacy is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best!
