{"id":94067,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"Blood,\" Catti-brie muttered grimly, holding a I torch and bending low over the line of droplets in the corridor, near the entry way of a small I chamber. \"Could be from the goblin fight,\" Bruenor said hopefully, but Catti-brie shook her head. \"Still wet,\" she replied. \"The blood from the goblin fight\u0027d be long dried by now.\" \"Then from them crawlers we seen,\" Bruenor reasoned, \"tearing apart the goblin bodies.\" Still Catti-brie was not convinced. Stooping low, torch held far in front of her, she went through the short doorway of the side chamber. Wulfgar clambered in behind and pushed past her as soon as the passage widened again, coming up defensively in front of the young woman. The barbarian\u0027s action did not sit well with Catti-brie. Perhaps, from Wulfgar\u0027s point of view, he was merely following a prudent course, getting his battle-ready body in front of one encumbered with a torch and whose eyes were on the floor. But Catti-brie doubted that possibility, felt that Wulfgar had come in so urgently because she had been in the lead, because of his need to protect her and stand between her and any possible danger. Proud and able, Catti-brie was more insulted than flattered. And worried, for if Wulfgar was so fearful of her safety, then he might well make a tactical mistake. The companions had survived many dangers together because each had found a niche in the band, because each had played a role complementary to the abilities of the others. Catti-brie understood clearly that a disruption of that pattern could be deadly. She pushed back ahead of Wulfgar, batting aside his arm when he held it out to block her progress. He glared at her, and she promptly returned the unyielding stare. \"What d\u0027ye got in there?\" came Bruenor\u0027s call, deflecting the imminent showdown. Catti-brie looked back to see the dark form of her father crouched in the low doorway, Cobble and Pwent, who held the second torch, out in the corridor behind him. \"Empty,\" Wulfgar answered firmly, and turned to go. Catti-brie kept on crouching and looking about, though, as much to prove the barbarian wrong as in an honest search for clues. \"Not empty,\" she corrected a moment later, and her superior tone turned Wulfgar back around and lured Bruenor into the chamber. They flanked Catti-brie, who bent low over a tiny object on the floor: a crossbow quarrel, but far too small for any of the crossbows Bruenor\u0027s fighters carried, or any similar weapon the companions had ever seen. Bruenor picked it up in his stubby fingers, brought it close to his eyes, and studied it carefully. \"We got pixies in these tunnels?\" he asked, referring to the diminutive but cruel sprites more common to woodland settings. \"Some type of - \" Wulfgar began. \"Drow,\" Catti-brie interrupted. Wulfgar and Bruenor turned on her, Wulfgar\u0027s clear eyes flashing with anger at being interrupted, but only for the moment it took him to understand the gravity of what Catti-brie had announced. \"The elf had a bow that\u0027d fit this?\" Bruenor balked. \"Not Drizzt,\" Catti-brie corrected grimly, \"other drow.\" Wulfgar and Bruenor screwed up their faces in obvious doubt, but Catti-brie felt certain of her guess. Many times in the past, back in Icewind Dale on the empty slopes of Kelvin\u0027s Cairn, Drizzt had told her of his homeland, had told her of the remarkable accomplishments and exotic artifacts of the dark elf nation. Among those artifacts was the most favored weapon of the dark elves, hand-held crossbows, with quarrels usually tipped in poison. Wulfgar and Bruenor looked to each other, each hopeful that the other would find some logic to defeat Catti-brie\u0027s grim assertions. Bruenor only shrugged, tucked the quarrel away, and started for the outside passage. Wulfgar looked back to the young woman, his face flushed with concern. Neither of them spoke - neither had to - for they both knew well the horror-filled tales of marauding dark elves. The implications seemed grave indeed if Catti-brie\u0027s guess proved correct, if drow elves had come to Mithril Hall. There was something more in Wulfgar\u0027s expression that troubled Catti-brie, though, a possessive protectiveness that the young woman was beginning to believe would get them all in trouble. She pushed past the huge man, dipping low and exiting the chamber, leaving Wulfgar in the dark with his inner turmoil. The caravan made its slow but steady way through the tunnels, the passageways becoming ever more natural. Drizzt still wore his armor but had been stripped of his weapons and had his hands tightly bound behind his back by some magical cord that would not loosen in the least, no matter how he managed to twist his wrists. Dinin, eight legs clicking on the stone, led the troupe, with Vierna and Jarlaxle a short way behind. Several in the twenty-drow party had fallen into formation behind them, including the two keeping watch over Drizzt. They intersected once with the larger, flanking band of House Baenre soldiers, Jarlaxle issuing quiet orders and the second drow force slipping, melting, away into the shadows. Only then did Drizzt begin to understand the import of the raid on Mithril Hall. By his count, somewhere between two and three score dark elves had come up from Menzoberranzan, a formidable raiding party indeed. And it had all been for him. What of Entreri? Drizzt wondered. How did the assassin fit into this? He seemed to mesh so well with the dark elves. Of similar build and temperament, the assassin moved along with the drow ranks easily, inconspicuously. Too well, Drizzt thought. Entreri spent some time with the shaven-headed mercenary and Vierna, but then dropped back rank by rank, making his way inevitably toward his most-hated enemy. \"Well met,\" he said coyly when he at last fell into step beside Drizzt. A look from the human sent the two closest dark elf guards moving respectfully away. Drizzt eyed the assassin closely for a moment, looking for clues, then pointedly turned away. \"What?\" Entreri insisted, grabbing the obstinate drow\u0027s shoulder and turning him back. Drizzt stopped abruptly, drawing concerned looks from the drow flanking him, particularly Vierna. He started moving again immediately, though, not liking the attention and, gradually, the other dark elves settled into their comfortable pace around him. \"I do not understand,\" Drizzt remarked offhandedly to Entreri. \"You had the mask, had Regis, and knew where I could be found. Why then did you ally with Vierna and her gang?\" \"You presume that the choice was mine to make,\" Entreri replied. \"Your sister found me - I did not seek her out.\" \"Then you are a prisoner,\" Drizzt reasoned. \"Hardly,\" Entreri replied without hesitation, chuckling as he spoke. \"You said it correctly the first time. I am an ally.\" \"Where my kin are concerned, the two are much the same.\" Again Entreri chuckled, apparently seeing the bait for what it was. Drizzt winced at the sincerity in the assassin\u0027s laughter, because he then realized the strength in the bonds of his enemies, ties he had hoped, in a fleeting moment of any hope, he might stretch and exploit. \"I deal with Jarlaxle, actually,\" the assassin explained, \"not your volatile sister. Jarlaxle, the pragmatic mercenary, the opportunist. That one, I understand. He and I are much alike!\" \"When you are no longer needed - \" Drizzt began ominously. \"But I am and shall continue to be!\" Entreri interrupted. \"Jarlaxle, the opportunist,\" he reiterated loudly, drawing an approving nod from the mercenary, who apparently understood well the Common tongue of the surface. \"What gain would Jarlaxle find in killing me? I am a valuable tie to the surface, am I not? The head of a thieves\u0027 guild in exotic Calimport, an ally that might well prove useful in the future. I have dealt with Jarlaxle\u0027s kind all my life, guild-masters from a dozen cities along the Sword Coast.\" \"Drow have been known to kill for the simple pleasure of killing,\" Drizzt protested, not willing to let go of this one loose strand so easily. \"Agreed,\" Entreri replied, \"but they do not kill when they stand to gain by not killing. Pragmatic. You will not shake this alliance, doomed Drizzt. It is of mutual benefit, you see, to your inevitable loss.\" Drizzt paused a long while to digest the information, to find some way to regain that potentially unwinding strand, that loose end that he believed always existed when treacherous individuals came together on any cause. \"Not mutual benefit,\" he said quietly, noting Entreri\u0027s curious glance his way. \"Explain,\" Entreri bade him after a long moment of silence. \"I know why you came after me,\" Drizzt reasoned. \"It was not to have me killed, but to kill me yourself. And not just to kill me, but to defeat me in even combat. That possibility seems less likely now, in these tunnels beside merciless Vierna and her desires for simple sacrifice.\" \"So formidable even when all is lost,\" Entreri remarked, his superior tones pulling that elusive strand from Drizzt\u0027s reach once more. \"Defeat you in combat, I will - that is the deal, you see. In a chamber not so far from here, your kin and I will part company, but not until you and I have settled our rivalry.\" \"Vierna would not let you kill me,\" Drizzt retorted. \"But she would allow me to defeat you,\" Entreri answered. \"She desires that very thing, desires that your humiliation be complete. After I have settled our business, then she will give you to Lloth ... with my blessings. \"Come now, my friend,\" Entreri purred, seeing no response coming from Drizzt, seeing Drizzt\u0027s face screwed up in an uncharacteristic pout. \"I am not your friend,\" Drizzt growled back. \"My kindred, then,\" Entreri teased, his delight absolute when Drizzt turned an angry glower at him. \"Never.\" \"We fight,\" Entreri explained. \"We both fight so very well, and fight to win, though our purposes for battle may vary. I have told you before that you cannot escape me, cannot escape who you are.\" Drizzt had no answer for that, not in a corridor surrounded by enemies and with his hands tied behind his back. Entreri had indeed made these claims before, and Drizzt had reconciled them, had come to terms with the decisions of his life and with the path he had chosen as his own. But seeing the obvious pleasure on the evil assassin\u0027s face disturbed the honorable drow nonetheless. Whatever else he might do in this seemingly hopeless situation, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden determined then not to give Entreri his satisfaction. They came to an area of many side passages, winding, scalloped tunnels, worm holes, they seemed, meandering and rolling about in every direction at once. Entreri had said that the room, the parting of ways, was close, and Drizzt knew he was running out of time. He dove headlong to the floor, tucked his feet in tight, and slipped his arms over them, then brought them back in front, as he rolled to a standing position. By the time he turned back, the ever-alert Entreri already had his sword and dagger in hand, but Drizzt charged him anyway. Weaponless, the drow had no practical chance, but he guessed that Entreri would not strike him down, guessed that the assassin would not so impulsively destroy the even challenge he desperately craved, the very moment Entreri had worked so very hard to achieve. Predictably, Entreri hesitated, and Drizzt was beyond his half-hearted defenses in a moment, leaping into the air and landing a double-footed kick on Entreri\u0027s face and chest that sent the man flying away. Drizzt bounced back to his feet and rushed toward the entrance to the nearest side tunnel, blocked by a single drow guard. Again Drizzt came on fearlessly, hoping that Vierna had promised incredible torments to anyone who stole her sacrifice - a hope that seemed confirmed when Drizzt glanced back to Vierna, to see her hand holding back Jarlaxle\u0027s, the mercenary\u0027s fingers clutching a throwing dagger. The blocking drow fighter, as agile as a cat, punched out at the charging Drizzt, hilt first. But Drizzt, quicker still, snapped his hands straight up, and the ties binding his wrists hooked the fighter\u0027s weapon hand and threw his sword harmlessly high. Drizzt slammed into him, body to body, lifting his knee as they came together, and connecting cleanly on his opponent\u0027s abdomen. The fighter doubled over and Drizzt, with no time to spare, pushed past him, throwing him down to trip up the next soldier, and Entreri, coming in fast. Around a bend, down a short expanse, then diving into yet another side passage, Drizzt barely managed to keep ahead of the pursuit - so close were his enemies in fact, that as he turned into the next passage, he heard a quarrel skip along the wall to the side. Even worse, the drow ranger noted other forms slipping in and out of the openings to the sides of the tunnel. There had been no more than seven dark elves in the corridor with him, but he knew that more than twice that number had accompanied Vierna, not to mention the larger force that had been left behind not so long ago. The missing soldiers were all about, Drizzt knew, flanking and scouting, feeding reports along prescribed routes in silent codes. Around another bend he went, then another, turning back opposite the first. He scrambled up a short wall, then cursed his luck when the branching corridor atop it sloped back down to the previous level. Around another bend he saw a flash of heat glowing fiercely and knew it was a signal speculum, a metal plate magically heated on one side, which the dark elves used for signaling. The heated side glowed like a mirror in sunlight to beings using infravision. Drizzt cut down a side passage, realizing that the webs were tightening about him, knowing that his attempt would not succeed. Then the drider reared up in front of him. Drizzt\u0027s revulsion was absolute, and he backpedaled in spite of the dangers he knew were behind him. To see his brother in such a state! Dinin\u0027s bloated torso moved in harmony with the eight scrabbling legs, his face an expressionless death mask. Drizzt quieted his churning emotions, his need to scream out, and looked for a practical way to get past this obstacle. Dinin had turned his twin axes to their blunt sides, waving them wildly, and his eight legs kicked and bucked, giving Drizzt no obvious opening. Drizzt had no choice; he spun about, intending to flee back the other way. Vierna, Jarlaxle, and Entreri turned the corner to greet him. They conversed quietly in the Common tongue. Entreri said something about settling his score then and there, but apparently changed his mind. Vierna advanced instead, her whip of five living snake heads waving ominously before her. \"If you defeat me, then you can have back your freedom,\" she teased in the drow tongue, as she tossed Twinkle to the floor at Drizzt\u0027s feet. He went for the weapon and Vierna struck, but Drizzt had expected as much and he fell back short of his dropped scimitar, leaving Twinkle just out of reach. The drider scrambled ahead, an axe clipping Drizzt\u0027s shoulder, knocking him backward toward Vierna. The ranger had no other choice now, and dove headlong for his blade, his fingers barely reaching it. Snake fangs dug into his wrist. Another bite took him on the forearm and three more dove at his face or at his other hand, which was twisted over his grasping hand in a feeble defense. The sting of the bites was vicious, but it was the more insidious poison that defeated Drizzt. He had Twinkle in his grasp, he thought, but he couldn\u0027t be certain, since his numbed fingers could no longer feel the weapon\u0027s metal. Vierna\u0027s cruel whip lashed out again, five heads biting eagerly into Drizzt\u0027s flesh, spreading the waves of numbness throughout his battered form. The merciless priestess of a merciless goddess beat the helpless prisoner a dozen times, her face twisted in absolute, evil glee. Drizzt stubbornly held consciousness, eyed her with utter contempt, but that only prodded Vierna on, and she would have beaten him to death then and there had not Jarlaxle, and more pointedly, Entreri, come beside her and calmed her. For Drizzt, his body racked with agony and all hope of survival long flown, it seemed less than a reprieve. \"Aaargh!\" Bruenor wailed. \"Me kinfolk!\" Thibbledorf Pwent\u0027s reaction to the gruesome scene of seven slaughtered dwarves was even more dramatic. The battlerager floundered to the side of the tunnel and began slamming his forehead against the stone wall. Undoubtedly he would have knocked himself cold had not Cobble quietly reminded him that his hammering could be heard a mile away. \"Killed clean and fast,\" Catti-brie commented, trying to keep rational and make some sense of this newest clue. \"Entreri,\" Bruenor growled. \"By all our guesses, if he\u0027s truly wearing the face and body of Regis, these dwarves were missing afore he went into these tunnels,\" Catti-brie reasoned. \"Seems the assassin might have bringed some helpers along.\" The image of the small crossbow bolt played in her mind and she hoped her suspicions would prove false. \"Dead helpers when I get me hands around their murdering throats!\" Bruenor promised. He fell to his knees then, hunched over a dead dwarf who had been a close friend. Catti-brie could not bear the sight. She looked away from her father, to Wulfgar, standing quietly and holding the torch. Wulfgar\u0027s scowl, aimed at her, caught her by surprise. She studied him for a few moments. \"Well, say yer thoughts,\" she demanded, growing uncomfortable under his unrelenting glare. \"You should not have come down here,\" the barbarian answered calmly. \"Drizzt is not me friend, then?\" she asked, and she was surprised again at how Wulfgar\u0027s face crinkled in barely explosive rage at her mention of the dark elf. \"Oh, he is your friend, I do not doubt,\" Wulfgar replied, his tone dripping with venom. \"But you are to be my wife. You should not be in this dangerous place.\" Catti-brie\u0027s eyes opened wide in disbelief, in absolute outrage, showing the reflections of the torchlight as though some inner fire burned within them. \"\u0027Tis not yer choice to be making!\" she cried loudly - so loudly that Cobble and Bruenor exchanged concerned looks and the dwarf king rose from his dead friend and moved toward his daughter. \"You are to be my bride!\" Wulfgar reminded her, his volume equally disturbing. Catti-brie didn\u0027t flinch, didn\u0027t blink, her determined stare forcing Wulfgar back a step. The resolute young woman almost smiled in spite of her rage, with the knowledge that the barbarian was finally beginning to catch on. \"You should not be here,\" Wulfgar said again, renewing his strength in his declaration. \"Get yerself to Settlestone, then,\" Catti-brie retorted, poking a finger into Wulfgar\u0027s massive chest. \"For if ye\u0027re thinking I should not be here to help in finding Drizzt, then ye cannot call yerself a friend of the ranger!\" \"Not as much as you can!\" Wulfgar snarled back, his eyes glowing angrily, his face twisted and one fist clenched tightly at his side. \"What\u0027re ye saying?\" Catti-brie asked, sincerely confused by all of this, by Wulfgar\u0027s irrational words and erratic behavior. Bruenor had heard enough. He stepped between the two, pushing Catti-brie gently back and turning to squarely face the barbarian who had been like a son to him. \"What are ye saying, boy?\" the dwarf asked, trying to keep calm, though he wanted nothing more than to punch Wulfgar in the blabbering mouth. Wulfgar didn\u0027t look at Bruenor at all, just reached over the sturdy but short dwarf to point accusingly at Catti-brie. \"How many kisses have you and the drow shared?\" he bellowed. Catti-brie nearly fell over. \"What?\" she shrieked. \"Ye\u0027ve lost yer senses. I never - \" \"You lie!\" Wulfgar roared. \"Damn yer words!\" howled Bruenor and out came his great axe. He whipped it across, forcing Wulfgar to leap back and slam hard against the corridor wall, then chopped with it, forcing the barbarian to dive aside. Wulfgar tried to block with the torch, but Bruenor slapped it from his hand. Wulfgar tried to get to Aegis-fang, which he had slipped under his backpack when they had found the dead dwarves, but Bruenor came at him relentlessly, never actually striking, but forcing him to dodge and dive, to scramble across the hard stone. \"Let me kill him for ye, me king!\" Pwent cried, rushing up and misunderstanding Bruenor\u0027s intentions. \"Get ye back!\" Bruenor roared at the battlerager, and all the others were amazed, Pwent most among them, at the sheer force of Bruenor\u0027s voice. \"I been playing along with yer stupid actions for weeks now,\" Bruenor said to Wulfgar, \"but I\u0027ve no more time for ye. Ye speak out whatever\u0027s got yer hair up here and now, or shut yer stupid mouth and keep it shut until we find Drizzt and get us outta these stinking tunnels!\" \"I have tried to remain calm,\" Wulfgar retorted, and it seemed more a plea, since the barbarian was still on his knees from dodging Bruenor\u0027s dangerously close swings. \"But I cannot ignore the insult to my honor!\" As though realizing his subservient appearance, the proud barbarian leaped to his feet. \"Drizzt met with Catti-brie before the drow returned to Mithril Hall.\" \"Who telled ye that?\" Catti-brie demanded. \"Regis!\" Wulfgar shouted back. \"And he told me that your meeting was filled with more than words!\" \"It\u0027s a lie!\" Catti-brie cried. Wulfgar started to respond in kind, but he saw Bruenor\u0027s wide smile and heard the dwarf\u0027s mocking laughter. The head of the dwarf\u0027s axe dropped to the floor, Bruenor placing both hands on his hips and shaking his head in obvious disbelief. \"Ye stupid ...,\" the dwarf muttered. \"Why don\u0027t ye use whatever part o\u0027 yer body\u0027s not muscle and think o\u0027 what ye just said? We\u0027re here because we\u0027re guessing that Regis ain\u0027t Regis!\" Wulfgar scrunched his face up in confusion, realizing only then that he had not reconsidered the halfling\u0027s volatile accusations in light of the recent revelations. \"If ye\u0027re feeling as stupid as ye look, then ye\u0027re feeling the way ye ought to feel,\" Bruenor remarked dryly. The sudden revelations hit Wulfgar as surely as Bruenor\u0027s axe ever could. How many times had Regis spoken with j him alone these last few days? And what, he considered carefully, had been the content of those many meetings? For the first time, perhaps, Wulfgar realized what he had done in his chamber against the drow, truly realized that he would have killed Drizzt if the drow had not won the battle. \"The halfling ... Artemis Entreri, tried to use me in his evil plans,\" Wulfgar reasoned. He remembered a swirling myriad of sparkling reflections, the facets of a gemstone, inviting him down into its depths. \"He used his pendant on me - -I cannot be sure, but I think I remember ... I believe he used ...\" \"Be sure,\" Bruenor said. \"I knowed ye a long time, lad, and never have I knowed ye to act so damned stupid. And meself as well. To send the halfling along with Drizzt into this unknown region!\" \"Entreri tried to get me to kill Drizzt,\" Wulfgar went on, trying to fathom it all. \"Tried to get Drizzt to kill yerself, ye mean,\" Bruenor corrected. Catti-brie snorted, unable to contain her pleasure and her gratitude that Bruenor had put the boastful ! barbarian in his place. Wulfgar scowled at her from over Bruenor\u0027s shoulder. \"You did meet with the drow,\" he stated. \"That\u0027s me own business,\" the young woman replied, not giving in an inch to Wulfgar\u0027s lingering jealousy. The tension began to mount again - Catti-brie could see that while the revelations about Regis had taken some of the bite from Wulfgar\u0027s growl, the protective man still did not wish her there, did not wish his bride-to-be in a dangerous situation. Stubborn and proud, Catti-brie remained more insulted than flattered. She didn\u0027t get the chance to vent her rage, though, not then, for Cobble came shuffling back to the group, begging them all to be silent. Only then did Bruenor and the others notice that Pwent was no longer present. \"Noise,\" the cleric explained quietly, \"somewhere farther along in the deeper tunnels. Let us pray to Moradin that whatever is down there did not hear the clamor of our own stupidity!\" Catti-brie looked to the fallen dwarves, looked to see Wulfgar do likewise, and knew that the barbarian, like her, was reminding himself that Drizzt was in serious danger. How petty their arguments seemed to her then, and she was ashamed. Bruenor sensed her despair, and he came over to her and draped his arm across her shoulders. \"Had to be said,\" he offered comfortingly. \"Had to be brought out and cleared afore the fighting begins.\" Catti-brie nodded her agreement and hoped that the fighting, if there was to be any, would begin soon. She hoped, too, with all her heart, that the next battle would not be fought as vengeance for the death of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-13.html","bookId":2127,"book":{"id":2127,"title":"The Legacy (Legacy of the Drow #1)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #1: The Legacy A new mass market edition of the New York Times best-selling sword and sorcery classic, The Legacy is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best!
