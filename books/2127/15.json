{"id":94069,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Thibbledorf Pwent rushed along a side passage, running parallel and twenty feet to the right of the tunnel where he had split from his companions to go out on a prudent flanking maneuver. He heard the crash of the warhammer-blasted door, the sizzle of Catti-brie\u0027s arrows, and cries from several places, even a growl or two, and cursed his luck for being caught out of fun\u0027s way. Torch leading, the battlerager eagerly spun around a sharp left-hand corner, hoping to get back with the others before the fighting was through. He pulled up short, considering a curious figure, apparently as surprised to see him as he was to see it. \"Hey, now,\" the battlerager asked, \"is yerself Bruenor\u0027s pet drow?\" Pwent watched the slender elf\u0027s hand come up and heard the \"click\" as a hand-held crossbow fired, the quarrel striking Pwent\u0027s sturdy armor and slipping through one of the many cracks to draw a drop of blood on the dwarf\u0027s shoulder. \"Guess not!\" the happy Pwent cried, charging wildly with every word and tossing his torch aside. He dipped his head, putting his helmet spike in line, and the dark elf, seeming amazed at the sheer viciousness of this one\u0027s attack, fumbled to get his sword out and ready. Pwent, barely able to see but fully expecting the defense, whipped his head from side to side as he neared the target, parrying the sword away. He stood up straight again without slowing and launched himself at his opponent, barreling into the stunned dark elf with abandon. They crashed against the wall, the drow still holding his balance, and holding Pwent up in the air, not knowing what to make of this unusual, hugging battle style. The dark elf shook his sword hand free, while Pwent simply began to shake, his sharp-ridged armor digging lines in the drow\u0027s chest. The elf squirmed frantically, his own desperate actions only aiding the battlerager\u0027s convulsive attack. Pwent freed one arm and punched wildly, glove nail poking holes in the smooth ebony skin. The dwarf kneed and elbowed, bit the drow on the nose, and punched him in the side. \"Aaaaaargh!\" The growling scream erupted all the way from Pwent\u0027s belly, reverberating unsteadily from his flapping lips as he furiously whipped himself about. He felt the warmth of his enemy\u0027s flowing blood, the sensation only driving him, driving the most wild battlerager, to further heights of ferocity. \"Aaaaaargh!\" The drow went down in a heap, Pwent atop him, still convulsing wildly. In a few moments, his enemy no longer squirmed, but Pwent did not relinquish his advantage. \"Ye sneaky elven thing!\" he roared, repeatedly slamming his forehead into the dark elf\u0027s face. Quite literally, the battlerager, with his sharpened armor and spiked joints, shook the unfortunate drow apart. Pwent finally let go and hopped to his feet, pulling the limp body to a sitting position and leaving it slumped against the wall. The battlerager felt the pain in his back and realized that the drow\u0027s sword had hit him at least once. Of more concern, though, was the numbness flowing down Pwent\u0027s arm, poison spreading from the crossbow wound. Rage mounting once more, Pwent dipped his pointy helmet, scraped a boot across the stone several times for traction, and rushed ahead, spearing the already dead foe through the chest. When he jumped back this time, the dead drow toppled to the floor, warm blood spreading out under the body\u0027s ripped torso. \"Hope ye wasn\u0027t Bruenor\u0027s pet drow,\" the battlerager remarked, suddenly realizing that the whole incident might have been an honest mistake. \"Oh, well, can\u0027t be helped now!\" Cobble, magically inspecting for traps ahead, instinctively winced as another arrow zipped past his shoulder, its silver shine diminishing into the brightly lit chamber beyond. The dwarven cleric forced himself back to his work, wanting to be done quickly, that he might loose the charge of Bruenor and the others. A crossbow quarrel dove into his leg, but the cleric wasn\u0027t too concerned about its buglike sting or its poison, for he had placed enchantments upon himself to slow the drug\u0027s effects. Let the dark elves hit him with a dozen such bolts; it would be hours before Cobble fell to sleep. His scan of the corridor complete, with no immediate traps discerned, Cobble called back to others, who were impatient and already moving toward him. When the cleric looked back, though, in the dim light emanating from the enemies\u0027 chamber, he noticed something curious across the floor: metallic shavings. \"Iron?\" he whispered. Instinctively his hand went into his bulging pouch, filled with enchanted pebble bombs, and he went into a defensive crouch, holding his free hand out behind him to warn the others back. When he focused within the general din of the sudden battle, he heard a female draw voice, chanting, spell-casting. The dwarf\u0027s eyes widened in horror. He turned back, yelling for his friends to be gone, to run away. He, too, tried to run, his boots slipping across the smooth stone, so fast did his little legs begin to move. He heard the drow spell-caster\u0027s crescendo. The iron shavings immediately became an iron wall, unsupported and angled, and it fell over poor Cobble. There came a great gush of wind, the great explosion of tons of iron slamming against the stone floor, and flying spurts of pressure-squeezed blood and gore whipped back into the faces of the three stunned companions. A hundred small explosions, a hundred tiny sparkling bursts, rang hollowly under the collapsed iron wall. \"Cobble,\" Catti-brie breathed helplessly. The magical light in the distant chamber went away. A ball of darkness appeared just outside the chamber door, blocking the end of the passageway. A second ball of darkness came up, just ahead of the first, and a third after that, covering the back edge of the fallen iron wall. \"Get charging!\" Thibbledorf Pwent cried at them, coming back into the corridor and rushing past his hesitating friends. A ball of darkness appeared right in front of the battlerager, stopping him short. Hand crossbow after hand crossbow clicked unseen behind the blackness, sending stinging little darts whipping out. \"Back!\" Bruenor cried. Catti-brie loosed another arrow; Pwent, hit a dozen times, began to slump to the stone. Wulfgar grabbed him by the helmet spike and started away after the red-bearded dwarf. \"Drizzt,\" Catti-brie moaned quietly. She dropped low to one knee, firing another arrow and another after that, hoping that her friend would not come running out of the room into danger\u0027s path. A quarrel, oozing poison, clicked against her bow and bounced harmlessly wide. She could not stay. She fired one more time, then turned and ran after her father and the others, away from the friend she had come to rescue. Drizzt fell a dozen feet, slammed against the sloping side of the chute, and careened along a winding and swiftly descending way. He held tightly to his scimitars; his greatest fear was that one of them would get away from him and wind up cutting him in half as he bounced along. He did a complete loop, managed to somersault to put his feet out in front of him, but inadvertently got turned back around at the next vertical drop, the ending slam nearly knocking him unconscious. Just as he thought he was gaining control, was about to turn himself about once more, the chute opened up diagonally into a lower passageway. Drizzt rifled out, though he kept the presence of mind to hurl his scimitars to their respective sides, clear of his tumbling body. He hit the floor hard, rolled across, and slammed his lower back into a jutting boulder. Drizzt Do\u0027Urden lay very still. He did not consider the pain - fast changing to numbness - in his legs; he did not inspect the many scrapes and bruises the tumbling ride had given him. He did not even think of Entreri, and at that agonizing moment, one notion overruled even the loyal dark elf\u0027s compelling fears for his friends. He had broken his vow. When young Drizzt had left Menzoberranzan, after killing Masoj Hun\u0027ett, a fellow dark elf, he had vowed that he would never again kill a drow. That vow had held up, even when his family had come after him in the wilds of the Underdark, even when he had battled his eldest sister. Zaknafein\u0027s death had been fresh in his mind and his desire to kill the wicked Briza as great as any desire he had ever felt. Half mad from grief, and from ten years of surviving in the merciless wilds, Drizzt still had managed to hold to his vow. But not now. There could be no doubt that he had killed the guardsman at the top of the chute; his scimitars had cut fine lines, a perfect X across the dark elf\u0027s throat. It had been a reaction, Drizzt reminded himself, a necessary move if he meant to be free of Vierna\u0027s gang. He had not precipitated the violence, had not asked for it in any way. He could not reasonably be blamed for taking whatever action necessary to escape from Vierna\u0027s unjust court, and to aid his friends, coming in against powerful adversaries. Drizzt could not reasonably be blamed, but as he lay there, the feeling gradually returning to his bruised legs, Driz7.t\u0027s conscience could not escape the simple truth of the matter. He had broken his vow. Bruenor led them blindly through the twisting maze of corridors, Wulfgar right behind and carrying the snoring Pwent (and getting a fair share of cuts from the battlerager\u0027s sharp-ridged armor!). Catti-brie slipped along at his side, pausing whenever pursuit seemed close behind to launch an arrow or two. Soon the halls were quiet, save the group\u0027s own clamor - too quiet, by the frightened companions\u0027 estimation. They knew how silent Drizzt could move, knew that stealth was the dark elves\u0027 forte. But where to run? They could hardly figure out where they were in this little known region, would have to stop and take time to get their bearings before they could make a reasonable guess on how to get back to familiar territory. Finally, Bruenor came upon a small side passage that branched three ways, each fork branching again just a short way in. Following no predetermined course, the red-bearded dwarf led them in, left then right, and soon they came into a small chamber, goblin worked and with a large slab of stone just inside the low entryway. As soon as they at! were in, Wulfgar leaned the slab against the portal and fell back against it. \"Drow!\" Catti-brie whispered in disbelief. \"How did they come to Mithril Hall?\" \"Why, not how,\" Bruenor corrected quietly. \"Why are the elf\u0027s kin in me tunnels? \"And what?\" Bruenor continued grimly. He looked to his daughter, his beloved Catti-brie, and to Wulfgar, the proud lad he had helped mold into so fine a man, a sincerely grave expression on the dwarf\u0027s bristling cheeks. \"What have we landed ourself into this time?\" Catti-brie had no answer for him. Together the companions had battled many monsters, had overcome incredible obstacles, but these were dark elves, infamous drow, deadly, evil, and apparently with Drizzt in their clutches, if indeed he still drew breath. The mighty friends had gone in fast and strong to rescue Drizzt, had struck the dark elves by surprise. They had been simply overmatched, driven back without catching more than a fleeting glimpse of what might have been their lost friend. Catti-brie looked to Wulfgar for support, saw him staring her way with the same helpless expression Bruenor had placed over her. The young woman looked away, having neither the time nor the inclination to berate the protective barbarian. She knew that Wulfgar continued to be worried more for her than for himself - she could not chastise him for that - but Catti-brie, the fighter, knew, too, that if Wulfgar was looking out for her, his eyes would not be focused on the dangers ahead. In this situation, she was a liability to the barbarian, not for any lack of fighting skills or survival talents, but because of Wulfgar\u0027s own weakness, his inability to view Catti-brie as an equal ally. And with dark elves all about them, how badly they needed allies! Using innate powers of levitation, the pursuing drow soldier eased himself out of the chute, his gaze immediately locking on the slumped form under the thick cloak across the corridor. He pulled out a heavy club and rushed across, crying out with joy for the rewards that certainly would come his way for recapturing Drizzt. The club came down, sounding unexpectedly sharp as it banged off the solid stone under Drizzt\u0027s cloak. As silent as death, Drizzt came down from his perch above the chute exit, right behind his adversary. The evil drow\u0027s eyes widened as he realized the deception, remembered then the stone lying opposite the chute. Drizzt\u0027s first instincts were to strike with the hilt of his scimitar; his heart asked him to honor his vow and take no more drow lives. A well-placed blow might drop this enemy and render him helpless. Drizzt could then bind him and strip him of his weapons. If Drizzt were alone in these runnels, if it simply were a matter of his desire to escape Vierna and Entreri, he would have followed the cry of his merciful heart. He could not ignore his friends above, though, no doubt struggling against those enemies he had left behind. He could not chance that this soldier, recovered, would bring harm to Bruenor or Wulfgar or Catti-brie. Twinkle came in point first, slicing through the doomed draw\u0027s backbone and heart, driving out the front of his chest, the blade\u0027s blue glow showing a reddish tint. When he pulled the scimitar back out, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had more blood on his hands. He thought again of his imperiled friends and gritted his teeth, determined, if not confident, that the blood would wash away. Part 4 Cat and Mouse What turmoil I felt when first I broke my most solemn, principle-intentioned vow: that I would never again I take the life of one of my people. The pain, a sense of failure, a sense of loss, was acute when I realized what wicked work my scimitars had done. The guilt faded quickly, though - -not because I came to excuse myself for any failure, but because I came to realize that my true failure was in making the vow, not in breaking it. When I walked out of my homeland, I spoke the words out of innocence, the naivete of unworldly youth, and I meant them when I said them, truly. I came to know, though, that such a vow was unrealistic, that if I pursued a course in life as defender of those ideals 1 so cherished, I could not excuse myself from actions dictated by that course if ever the enemies showed themselves to be draw elves. Quite simply, adherence to my vow depended on situations completely beyond my control. If, after leaving Menzoberranzan, I had never again met a dark elf in battle, I never would have broken my vow. Rut that, in the end, would not have made me any more honorable. Fortunate circumstances do not equate la high principles. When the situation arose, however, that dark elves threatened my dearest friends, precipitated a state of warfare against people who had done them no wrong, how could I, in good conscience, have kept my scimitars tucked away? What was my vow worth when weighed against the lives of Bruenor, Wulfgar, and Catti-brie, or when weighed against the lives of any innocents, for that matter? If, in my travels, I happened upon a draw raid against surface elves, or against a small village, 1 know beyond any doubts that I would have joined in the fighting, battling the unlawful aggressors with all my strength. In that event, no doubt, I would have felt the acute pangs of failure and soon would have dismissed them, as I do now. 1 do not, therefore, lament breaking my vow - though it pains me, as it always does, that 1 have had to kill. Nor do I regret making the vow, for the declaration of my youthful folly caused no subsequent pain. If 1 had attempted to adhere to the unconditional words of that declaration, though, if I had held my blades in check for a sense of false pride, and if that inaction had subsequently resulted in injury to an innocent person, then the pain in Drizzt Do\u0027Urden would have been more acute, never to leave. There is one more point I have come to know concerning my declaration, one more truth that I believe leads me farther along my chosen road in life.! said I would never again kill a draw elf. I made the assertion with little knowledge of the many other races of the wide world, surface and Underdark, with little understanding that many of these myriad peoples even existed. I would never kill a drow, so I said, but what of the svirfnebli, the deep gnomes? Or the halflings, elves, or dwarves? And what of the humans? I have had occasion to kill men, when Wulfgar\u0027s barbarian kin invaded Ten-Towns. To defend those innocents meant to battle, perhaps to kill, the aggressor humans. Yet that act, unpleasant as it may have been, did not in any way affect my most solemn vow, despite the fact that the reputation of humankind far outshines that of the dark elves. To say, then, that I would never again slay a drow, purely because they and 1 are of the same physical heritage, strikes me now as wrong, as simply racist. To place the measure of a living being\u0027s worth above that of another simply because that being wears the same color skin as I belittles my principles. The false values embodied in that long-ago vow have no place in my world, in the wide world of countless physical and cultural differences. It is these very differences that make my journeys exciting, these very differences that put new colors and shape* tin the universal concept of beauty. I now make a new vow, one weighed in experience and proclaimed with my eyes open: I will not raise my scimitars except in defense: in defense of my principles, of my life, or of others who cannot defend themselves. 1 will not do battle to further the causes of false prophets, to further the treasures of kings, or to avenge my own injured pride. And to the many gold-wealthy mercenaries, religious and secular, who would look upon such a vow as unrealistic, impractical, even ridiculous, 1 cross my arms over my chest and declare with conviction: 1 am the richer by far!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-15.html","bookId":2127,"book":{"id":2127,"title":"The Legacy (Legacy of the Drow #1)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #1: The Legacy A new mass market edition of the New York Times best-selling sword and sorcery classic, The Legacy is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best!
