{"id":94074,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Thibbledorf Pwent stood at the end of the narrow tunnel, scanning the wide cavern beyond with his infravision, registering the shifting gradations of heat, that he might better understand the layout of the dangerous area ahead. He made out the many teeth of the ceiling, stalactites long and narrow, and saw two distinctly cooler lines indicating ledges on the high walls - one directly ahead, the other along the wall on his right. Dark holes lined the walls at floor level in several places; Pwent knew that one immediately to his left, two directly across from where he stood, and another diagonally ahead and to the right, under the ledge, likely were long tunnels, and figured several others to be smaller side chambers or alcoves. Guenhwyvar was at the battlerager\u0027s side, the cat\u0027s ears flattened, its low growl barely perceptible. The panther sensed the danger, too, Pwent realized. He motioned for Guenhwyvar to follow him - suddenly he was not so upset at having so unusual a companion - and he skittered back down the corridor into the approaching torchlight to stop the others short of the room. \u0027There be at least three or four more ways in or out,\" the battlerager told his companions gravely, \"and lots of open ground across the place.\" He went on to give a thorough description of the chamber, paying particular attention to the many obvious hiding spots. Bruenor, sharing Pwent\u0027s dark fears, nodded and looked to the others. He, too, felt that their enemies were near, were all about them, and had been steadily closing in. The dwarf king looked back the way they had come, and it was obvious to the others that he was trying to figure out some other way around this region. \"We can turn their hoped-for surprise against them,\" Catti-brie offered, knowing the futility of Bruenor\u0027s hopes. The companions had precious little time to spare and few of the side tunnels they had passed offered little promise of bringing them to the lower regions, or to wider tunnels where they might find Drizzt. A sparkle of battle-lust came into Bruenor\u0027s dark eyes, but he frowned a moment later when Guenhwyvar plopped down heavily at Catti-brie\u0027s feet. \"The cat\u0027s been about too long,\" the young woman reasoned. \"Guenhwyvar\u0027s needing a rest soon.\" Wulfgar\u0027s and the dwarves\u0027 expressions showed that they did not welcome the news. \"More the reason to go straight ahead,\" Catti-brie said determinedly. \"Guen\u0027s got a bit of the fight left, don\u0027t ye doubt!\" Bruenor considered the words, then nodded grimly and slapped his many-notched axe across his open palm. \"Got to get in close to this enemy,\" he reminded his friends. Pwent produced his bitter potion. \"Take another hit,\" he offered to Catti-brie and Wulfgar. \"Got to make sure the stuff\u0027s fresh in yer belly.\" Catti-brie winced, but she did take the flask, then handed it to Wulfgar, who similarly frowned and took a brief draw. Bruenor and Pwent squatted to the floor between them, Pwent quickly scratching a rough map of the chamber. They had no time for detailed plans, but Bruenor sorted out areas of responsibility, assigning each person the task best suited to his or her battle style. The dwarf could give no specific directions to Guenhwyvar, of course, and didn\u0027t bother to include Pwent in much of the discussion, knowing that once the fighting began, the battlerager would go off on his wild, undisciplined way. Catti-brie and Wulfgar, too, realized Pwent\u0027s forthcoming role, and neither complained, understanding that, against skilled and precise opponents such as drow elves, a little chaos could well be a. good thing. They kept the torch burning, even lit a second one, and started cautiously ahead, ready to put the fight on their own terms. As the torchlight breached the room, a darting black form cut through, going into the darkness in full flight. Guenhwyvar broke to the right, cut left toward the center of the chamber, then darted right again, toward the back wall. From somewhere ahead there came the sound of firing crossbows, followed by the skip of quarrels hitting the stone, always one step behind the dodging, leaping panther. Guenhwyvar veered again at the last moment, leaped, and turned sidelong, paws running along the vertical wall for several strides before the panther had to come back to the floor. The cat\u0027s target, the high ledge on the right-hand wall was now in sight, and Guenhwyvar ran full out, speeding for it recklessly. At the base, in full stride, and apparently soaring toward a headfirst collision, the panther\u0027s muscles subtly shifted. Guenhwyvar\u0027s direction change was almost perpendicular, the panther flying, seeming to run, straight up the twenty-foot expanse to the ledge. The three dark elves atop the ledge could not have expected the incredible maneuver. Two fired their crossbows Guenhwyvar\u0027s way and fell back into a tunnel; the third, having the misfortune to be directly in the leaping panther\u0027s path, could only throw his arms up as the panther fell over him. Torches flew into the room, lighting the battle area, followed by the leading charge of Bruenor, flanked on his right by Wulfgar and on his left by Thibbledorf Pwent. Catti-brie quietly filtered in behind them, slipping to the side along the same general course Guenhwyvar had taken, her bow readied and in hand. Again the crossbows of unseen dark elves clicked, and all of the leading companions took hits. Wulfgar felt the venom streaming into his leg, but felt the tingling burn as Pwent\u0027s potent potion counteracted its sleepy effects. A darkness spell fell over one of the torches, defeating its light, but Wulfgar was ready, lighting a third and tossing it far to the side. Pwent noticed an enemy drow in the tunnel to the left, and off he went, predictably, roaring with every charging stride. Bruenor and Wulfgar slowed but kept their course straight across the room, for the largest tunnel entrances across the way. The barbarian caught sight of the flicker of drow eyes along the remaining ledge, farther ahead and above the tunnels. He stopped, twirled, and heaved his warhammer with a cry to his god. Aegis-fang went in low, crushing the lip of the walkway, smashing stone apart. One dark elf leaped away to another point on the long ledge; the other tumbled down, his leg blasted, and barely caught the stone halfway down the crumbling wall. Wulfgar did not follow the throw forward. He got hit again by a stinging quarrel and rushed instead to the side, to the remaining tunnel, along the right-hand wall, wherein crouched a pair of dark elves. Eager to join in close combat, Bruenor veered behind the barbarian. The dwarf looked back before he had even completed the turn, though, as an eight-legged monster, the drider, came out of the tunnel directly ahead, other dark forms shifting about behind it. With a whoop of delight, never considering the odds now that he and his friends were committed to the battle, the fiery dwarf veered again to his initial course, determined to meet the enemy, however many there might be, head on. It took all the discipline Catti-brie could muster to hold her first shot in check. She really didn\u0027t have a good angle for either those that Pwent had pursued or the ledge where Guenhwyvar had gone, and she didn\u0027t think it worth the trouble to spike the wounded drow hanging helplessly below the blasted ledge - not yet. Bruenor had bade her to make certain that her first shot, the one shot she might get before she was fully noticed, counted. The eager young woman watched the split between Bruenor and Wulfgar and found her opportunity. A drow, crouching behind a four-foot diagonal jag in the back wall, almost exactly halfway between her rushing companions, leaned out, crossbow in hand. The dark elf fired, then fell back in surprise as a silver arrow streaked past him, skipped off the stone, and left a smoldering scorch in its wake. Catti-brie\u0027s second shot was in the air an instant later. She could no longer see the drow, fully covered by the stone, but she did not believe his cover so thick. The arrow hit the jutting slab two feet from its edge, two feet from where it joined the wall. There came a sharp crack as the rock split, followed by a grunt as the arrow blasted deep into the dying drow\u0027s skull. The prone dark elf on the high ledge scrambled and kicked, kept his buckler above him, and managed, somehow, to get his dagger out with his other hand. Only his fine mesh armor kept Guenhwyvar\u0027s raking claws somewhat at bay, kept his mounting wounds serious but not mortal. He brought the dagger to bear on the panther\u0027s flank, but the weapon seemed small against such a foe, seemed only to further enrage the cat. His buckler arm was batted aside, back up over his head with enough force to dislocate his shoulder. He tried to get it back to block but found it would not respond to his mind\u0027s frantic call. He scrambled to put his other hand in the great paw\u0027s way, a futile defense. Guenhwyvar\u0027s claws hooked his scalp line just above his forehead. The drow plunged the dagger in again, praying for a quick kill. The panther\u0027s claws sheared off his face. Crossbows clicked again from down the tunnel at the back of the narrow ledge. Not really hurt, the panther came off its victim and loped ahead in pursuit. The two dark elves summoned globes of darkness between them and the cat, turned, and fled. If they had looked back, they might have rejoined the fight, for Guenhwyvar\u0027s pursuit was not dogged. With the dagger and quarrel wounds, the insidious sleep poison, and the simple duration of the panther\u0027s visit to the plane, Guenhwyvar\u0027s energy was no more. The cat did not wish to leave, wanted to stay and fight beside the companions, to stay to hunt for its missing master. The magic of the figurine would not support the desires, though. A few strides into the darkened area, Guenhwyvar stopped, barely holding a tentative balance. Panther flesh dissolved into gray smoke. The planar tunnel opened and beckoned. He got hit again as he exited the chamber, but the tiny quarrel did no more than bring a smile to the most wild battlerager\u0027s contorted face. A darkness globe blocked his flight, but he roared and barreled through, smiling even when he collided full force with the winding wall out the other side. The amazed dark elf, watching ferocious Pwent\u0027s progress, spun away, darting along the tunnel, then turned a sharp corner. Pwent came right behind, armor squealing and drool running from his fat lips in lines down his thick black beard. \"Stupid!\" he yelled, ducking his head as he spun the corner right behind the fleeing drow, fully expecting the ambush. Pwent\u0027s darting helmet spike intercepted the sword cut, impaling his enemy through the forearm. The battlerager didn\u0027t slow, but hurled himself into the air and lay out flat, body-blocking his opponent across the chest and driving the drow to the ground under him. Glove nails dug for the dark elf\u0027s groin and face; Pwent\u0027s ridged armor creased the fine mesh mail as he went into a series of violent convulsions. With each of the battlerager\u0027s movements, waves of searing agony ran up the drow\u0027s impaled arm. Bruenor noticed the slender form of a drow, wearing an outrageously wide-brimmed and plumed hat, moving about the entrance to the tunnel. Then came the flicker of objects cutting into the torchlight from behind the monstrous drider, and Bruenor threw his shield up defensively. A dagger banged against the metal, then another, and a third behind that. The fourth throw came in low, scraping the dwarf\u0027s shin; the fifth dipped over the leaning shield as Bruenor inevitably bent forward, cutting a line across the dwarf\u0027s scalp under the edge of his one-horned helmet. But minor wounds would not slow Bruenor, nor would the sight of the bloated drider, axes waving, eight legs clacking and scrabbling. The dwarf came in hard, took a hit on the shield, and returned with a smash against the drider\u0027s second descending axe. Much smaller than his opponent, Bruenor worked low, his axe smacking the hard exoskeleton of the drider\u0027s armored legs. All the while, the dwarf remained a blur of frenzied motion, his shield above him, as fine a shield as was ever forged, deflecting hit after hit from the wickedly edged, drow-enchanted weapons. Bruenor\u0027s axe dove into the wedge between two legs, cracking through to the drider\u0027s fleshy interior. The dwarf\u0027s smile was short-lived, though, for the drider\u0027s responses banged hard on the shield, twisting it about on Bruenor\u0027s arm, and the creature put a leg in line and kicked hard into the dwarf\u0027s belly, throwing Bruenor back before his axe could do any real damage. He squared off, his breath lost and his arm aching. Again came a series of dagger throws from the corridor behind the drider, forcing Bruenor off balance. He barely got his shield up to stop the last four. He looked down to the first, jutting from the front of his layered armor, a trickle of blood oozing from behind its tip, and knew he had escaped death by a hair\u0027s breadth. He knew, too, that the distraction would cost him dearly, for he was no longer squared up for melee and the drider was upon him. Wulfgar\u0027s flying hammer led the way to the corridor, his one throw more than matching the crossbow darts that struck the roaring barbarian. He aimed high, for the stalactite teeth hanging above the entryway, and his mighty hammer did its work perfectly, smashing apart several of the hanging rocks. One dark elf fell back - Wulfgar could not tell if the falling stone had crushed him or not - and the other dove forward, drawing sword and dagger and coming up in the chamber to meet the unarmed barbarian\u0027s charge. Wulfgar skidded to a stop short of the flashing blades, skipped to the side, and kicked out, punched out, doing anything to keep the dangerous and quick opponent at bay for the few seconds the barbarian needed. The drow, not understanding the magic of Aegis-fang, took his time, seemed in no hurry to chance the grasp of the obviously mighty human. He came with a measured combination, sword, dagger, and dagger again, the last thrust painfully nicking the barbarian\u0027s hip. The drow smiled wickedly. Aegis-fang appeared in Wulfgar\u0027s waiting hands. With one hand, grasping low on the warhammer\u0027s handle, Wulfgar sent the weapon into a flowing circular motion in front of him. The drow took careful measure of the weapon\u0027s speed - Wulfgar carefully appraised the drow\u0027s examination. In darted the dagger, behind the flowing hammer. Wulfgar\u0027s other hand clapped against the handle just under his weapon\u0027s head and abruptly reversed the direction, parrying the drow\u0027s attack aside. The drow was quick, snapping his sword in a downward angle for Wulfgar\u0027s shoulder even as his dagger hand was knocked wide. Wulfgar\u0027s huge forearm flexed with the strain as he halted the heavy hammer\u0027s flow, snapping it back up in front of him. He caught Aegis-fang halfway up the handle with his free hand and jabbed diagonally up, the warhammer\u0027s solid head intercepting the sword and driving it harmlessly away. The end of the parry left the drow with one arm wide and low, the other wide and high, and left Wulfgar standing before his opponent in perfect balance, both hands grasping Aegis-fang. Before the dark elf could recover his wide-flying blades, before he could set his feet to dive away, Wulfgar chopped him, the hammer crunching under his shoulder and driving down toward his opposite hip. The drow fell back from the blow, then, as though the full weight of the incredible hit had not immediately registered, went into an involuntary backward hop that slammed him against the wall. One leg buckling, one lung collapsed, the drow brought his sword horizontally before his face in a meager defense. Hands low on the handle, Wulfgar brought the hammer up behind him and slammed it home with all his strength, through the blade and into the drow\u0027s face. With a sickening crack, the drow\u0027s skull exploded, crushed between the unyielding stone of the wall and the unyielding metal of the mighty Aegis-fang. A blinding streak of silver halted the drider\u0027s attacks and saved Bruenor Battlehammer. The arrow didn\u0027t hit the drider, however. It soared high, pegging the wounded drow (who had just about climbed back to the blasted ledge) to the stone wall. The distraction, the moment to recover from the daggers, was all Bruenor needed. He came in hard again, his many-notched axe smashing the drider\u0027s closest leg, his shield up high to block the now off-balance axe swipes. The dwarf pressed right into the beast, using its bulk to offer him some cover from the enemies in the corridor, and bulled it backward before it could set its many legs against the charge. Another of Catti-brie\u0027s arrows whipped past him, sparking as it ricocheted along the stone of the corridor. Bruenor grinned widely, thankful that the gods had delivered to him an ally and friend as competent as Catti-brie. The first two arrows enraged Vierna; the third, coming down the corridor, nearly took off her head. Jarlaxle raced back from his position near the chamber\u0027s entrance to join her. \"Formidable,\" the mercenary admitted. \"I have dead soldiers in the room.\" Vierna raced forward, focusing on the dwarf battling her mutated brother. \"Where is Drizzi Do\u0027Urden?\" she demanded, using magic to focus her voice so that Bruenor would hear her through the drider. \"Ye hit me and ye\u0027re meaning to talk?\" the dwarf howled, finishing his sentence with an exclamation point in the form of a chopping axe. One of Dinin\u0027s legs fell free, and the dwarf barreled on, pushing the unbalanced drider back another few strides. Vierna hardly had the chance to begin her intended spell before Jarlaxle grabbed her and hauled her down. Her instinctive anger toward the mercenary was lost in the blast of yet another streaking arrow, this one driving a hole into the stone wall where the priestess had been standing. Vierna remembered Entreri\u0027s warning about this group, had the evidence right before her as the battle continued to sour. She trembled with rage, growled in decipher ably as she considered what the defeat might cost her. Her thoughts fell inward, followed the path of her faith toward her dark deity, and cried out to Lloth. \"Vierna!\" Jarlaxle called from someplace remote. Lloth could not allow her to fail, had to help her against this unexpected obstacle, that she might deliver the sacrifice. \"Vierna!\" She felt the mercenary\u0027s hands on her, felt the hands of a second drow helping Jarlaxle put her back on her feet. \"Wishya!\" came her unintentional cry, then she knew only calm, knew that Lloth had answered her call. Jarlaxle and the other drow slammed against the tunnel\u0027s walls from the force of Vierna\u0027s magical outburst. Each looked at her with trepidation. The mercenary\u0027s features relaxed when Vierna bade him to follow her farther along the corridor, out of harm\u0027s way. \"Lloth will help us finish what we have started here,\" the priestess explained. Catti-brie put another arrow into the corridor for good measure, then glanced about, searching for a more apparent target. She studied the battle between Bruenor and the monstrous drider, but she knew that any shots she made at the bloated monster would be too risky given the furious melee. Wulfgar apparently had his situation under control. A drow lay dead at his feet as he peeked about the rubble of the collapsed corridor in search of the enemy who had not come in. Pwent was nowhere to be found. Catti-brie looked up to the blasted ledge above Bruenor and the drider for the draw who had not fallen, then to the other ledge, where Guenhwyvar had disappeared. In a small alcove below that area the young woman saw a curious sight: a gathering of mists similar to that heralding the panther\u0027s approach. The cloud shifted colors, became orange, almost like a swirling ball of flames. Catti-brie sensed an evil aura, gathering and overwhelming, and put her bow in line. The hairs on the back of her neck tingled; something was watching her. Catti-brie dropped the Heartseeker and spun about, snapping her short sword from its sheath with her turn, barely in time to bat aside the thrusting sword of a levitating drow that had silently descended from the ceiling. Wulfgar, too, noticed the mist, and he knew that it demanded his attention, that he must be ready to strike out at it as soon as its nature was revealed. He could not ignore Catti-brie\u0027s sudden cry, though, and when he looked at her, he found her hard pressed, nearly sitting on the floor, her short sword working furiously to keep her attacker at bay. In the shadows some distance behind the young woman and her attacker, another dark shape began its descent. The warm blood of his torn enemy mingled with the drool on Thibbledorf Pwent\u0027s beard. The drow had stopped thrashing, but Pwent, reveling in the kill, had not. A crossbow quarrel pierced his ear. His head came up as he roared, the impaled helmet spike lifting the dead drow\u0027s arm weirdly. There stood another enemy, advancing steadily. Up leaped the battlerager, snapping his head from side to side, whipping the caught drow back and forth until the ebony skin ripped apart, freeing the helmet spike. The approaching dark elf stopped his advance, trying to make some sense of the gruesome scene. He was moving again - back the other way - when indomitable Pwent took up the roaring charge. The drow was truly amazed at the stubby dwarf\u0027s frantic pace, amazed that he could not easily outdistance this enemy. He wouldn\u0027t have run too far anyway, though, preferring to bait this dangerous one away from the main battle. They went through a series of twisting corridors, the dark elf ten strides ahead. His graceful steps barely seemed to alter as he leaped, landing and spinning about, sword ready and smile wide. Pwent never slowed. He merely ducked his head to put his helmet spike in line. With his eyes to the stone, the battlerager realized the trap, too late, as he crossed the rim of a pit the drow had subtly leaped across. Down went the battlerager, crashing and bouncing, the many points of his battle armor throwing sparks as he skidded along the stone. He cracked a rib against the rounded top of a stalagmite mound some distance down, bounced completely over, and landed flat on his back in a lower chamber. He lay there for some time, admiring the cunning of his enemy and admiring the curious way the ceiling - tons of solid rock - continued to spin about. No novice with the sword, Catti-brie worked her blade marvelously, using every defense Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had shown her to gain back some measure of equal footing. She was confident that the drow\u0027s initial advantage was fading, confident that she could soon get her feet under her and come back up evenly against this opponent. Then, suddenly, she had no one to fight. Aegis-fang twirled by her, its windy wake bringing her thick hair about, and hit the surprised dark elf full force, blasting him away. Catti-brie spun about, her initial appreciation lost as soon as she recognized Wulfgar\u0027s protectiveness. The mist near the barbarian was forming by then, taking on the substantial, corporeal body of a denizen of some vile lower plane, some enemy far more dangerous than the dark elf Catti-brie had been battling. Wulfgar had come to her aid at the risk of his own peril, had put her safety above his own. To Catti-brie, confident that she could have taken care of her own situation, that act seemed more stupid than altruistic. Catti-brie went for her bow - she had to get to her bow. Before she even had her hands on it, though, the monster, the yochlol, came fully to the plane. Amorphous, it somewhat resembled a lump of half-melted wax, showing eight tentaclelike appendages and a central, gaping maw lined with long, sharp teeth. Catti-brie sensed danger behind her before she could call out to Wulfgar. She spun, bow in hand, and looked up to her enemy, to a drow\u0027s sword fast descending for her head. Catti-brie shot first. The arrow jolted the drow several inches from the floor and passed right through the dark elf to explode in a shower of sparks against the ceiling. The drow was still standing when he came back to the floor, still holding his sword, his expression revealing that he was not quite sure what had just happened. Catti-brie grabbed her bow like a club and jumped up to meet him, pressing him fiercely until his mind registered the fact that he was dead. She looked back once, to see Wulfgar grabbed by one of the yochlol\u0027s tentacles, then another. All the barbarian\u0027s incredible strength could not keep him from the waiting maw. Bruenor could see nothing but the black of the drider\u0027s torso as he continued to bull in, continued to drive Dinin backward. He could hear nothing except the sounds of flying blades, the clang of metal against metal, or the sound of cracking shell whenever his axe struck home. He knew instinctively that Catti-brie and Wulfgar, his children, were in trouble. Bruenor\u0027s axe finally caught up with the retreating creature with full force as the drider slammed against the wall. Another spider leg fell away; Bruenor planted his feet and heaved with all his strength, launching himself several feet back. Dinin, weirdly contorted, two legs lost, did not immediately pursue, glad for the reprieve, but ferocious Bruenor came back in, the dwarf\u0027s savagery overwhelming the wounded drider. Bruenor\u0027s shield blocked the first axe; his helmet blocked the following strike, a blow that should have dropped him. Straight across whipped the dwarf\u0027s many-notched axe, above the hard exoskeleton to cut a jagged line across the bloated drider\u0027s belly. Hot gore spewed out. Fluids ran down the drider\u0027s legs and Bruenor\u0027s pumping arms. Bruenor went into a frenzy, his axe smacking repeatedly, incessantly, into the crook between the drider\u0027s two foremost legs. Exoskeleton gave way to flesh; flesh opened to spill more gore. Bruenor\u0027s axe struck hard yet again, but he took a hit atop the shoulder of his weapon arm. The drider\u0027s awkward angle stole most of the strength from the blow, and the axe did not get through Bruenor\u0027s fine mithril mail, but a blast of hot agony assaulted Bruenor. His mind screamed that Catti-brie and Wulfgar needed him! Grimacing against the pain, Bruenor whipped his axe in an upward backhand, its flat back cracking against the drider\u0027s elbow. The creature howled and Bruenor brought the weapon to bear again, angled up the other way, catching the drider in the armpit and shearing the creature\u0027s arm off. Catti-brie and Wulfgar needed him! The drider\u0027s longer reach got its second axe around the dwarf\u0027s blocking shield, its bottom edge drawing a line of blood up the back of Bruenor\u0027s arm. Bruenor tucked the shield in close and shoulder-blocked the monster against the wall. He bounced back, drove his axe in hard at the monster\u0027s exposed side, then shoulder-blocked again. Back bounced the dwarf, in chopped his axe, and Bruenor\u0027s stubby legs twitched again, sending him hurtling forward. This time, Bruenor heard the drider\u0027s other axe fall to the floor, and when he bounced back, he stayed back, chopping wildly with his axe, driving the drider to the stone, splitting flesh and breaking ribs. Bruenor turned about, saw Catti-brie in command of her situation, and took a step toward Wulfgar. \"Wishya!\" Waves of energy hit the dwarf, lifting his feet from the ground and launching him a dozen feet through the air, to slam against the wall. He rebounded in a redirected run, and he cried a single note of rage as he bore down on the entrance to the distant tunnel, the eyes of several drow watching him from farther within. \"Wishya!\" came the cry once more, and Bruenor was moving backward suddenly. \"How many ye got?\" the tough dwarf roared, shrugging off this newest hit against the wall. The eyes, every set, turned away. A globe of darkness fell over the dwarf, and he was, in truth, glad for its cover, for that last slam had hurt him more than he cared to admit. A fourth soldier joined Vierna, Jarlaxle, and their one bodyguard as they again moved deeper into the tunnels. \"Dwarf to the side,\" the newcomer explained. \"Insane, wild with rage. I put him down a pit, but I doubt he is stopped!\" Vierna began to reply, but Jarlaxle interrupted her, pointing down a side passage, to yet another drow signaling to them frantically in the silent hand code. Devil cat! the distant drow signaled. A second form rushed by him, followed by a third a few seconds later. Jarlaxle understood the movements of his troops, knew that these three were the survivors of two separate battles, and understood that both the ledge and the side passage below it had been lost. We must go, he signaled to Vierna. Let us find a more advantageous region ivhere we might continue this fight. \"Lloth has answered my call!\" Vierna growled at him. \"A handmaiden has arrived!\" \"More the reason to be gone,\" Jarlaxle replied aloud. \"Show your faith in the Spider Queen and let us be on with the hunt for your brother.\" Vierna considered the words for just a moment, then, to the worldly mercenary\u0027s relief, nodded her agreement. Jarlaxle led her along at a great pace, wondering if it could be true that only seven of his skilled Bregan D\u0027aerthe force, himself and Vierna included, remained. Wulfgar\u0027s arms slapped wildly at the waving tentacles; his hands clasped over those appendages wrapping him, trying to break free of their iron grip. More tentacles slapped in at him, forcing his attention. He was jerked out straight, yanked sidelong into the great maw, and he understood these newest slapping attacks to be merely diversions. Razor-edged teeth dug into his back and ribs, tore through muscle, and scraped against bone. He punched out and grabbed a handful of slimy yochlol skin, twisting and tearing a hunk free. The creature did not react, continued to bite bone, razor teeth working back and forth across the trapped torso. Aegis-fang came back to Wulfgar\u0027s hand, but he was twisted awkwardly for any hits against his enemy. He swung anyway, connecting solidly, but the fleshy, rubbery hide of the evil creature seemed to absorb the blows, sinking deep beneath the weight of Aegis-fang. Wulfgar swung again, twisted about despite the searing pain. He saw Catti-brie standing free, the second drow lying dead at her feet, and her face locked in an expression of open horror as she stared at the white of Wulfgar\u0027s exposed ribs. Still, the image of his love, free from harm, brought a grimace of satisfaction to the barbarian\u0027s face. A bolt of silver flashed right below, startling Wulfgar, blasting the yochlol, and the barbarian thought his salvation at hand, thought that his beloved Catti-brie, the woman he had dared to underestimate, would strike his attacker down. A tentacle wrapped around Catti-brie\u0027s ankles and jerked her from her feet. Her head hit the stone hard, her precious bow fell from her grasp, and she offered little resistance as the yochlol began to pull her in. \"No!\" Wulfgar roared, and he whacked again and again, futilely, at the rubbery beast. He cried out for Bruenor; out of the corner of his eye, he saw the dwarf stumble out of a dark globe, far away and dazed. The yochlol\u0027s maw crunched mercilessly; a lesser man would have long since collapsed under the force of that bite. Wulfgar could not allow himself to die, though, not with Catti-brie and Bruenor in danger. He began a hearty song to Tempus, his god of battle. He sang with lungs fast filling with blood, with a voice that came from a heart that had pumped mightily for more than twenty years. He sang and he forgot the waves of crippling pain; he sang and the song came back to his ears, echoing from the cavern walls like a chorus from the minions of an approving god. He sang and he tightened his grip on Aegis-fang. Wulfgar struck out, not against the beast, but against the alcove\u0027s low ceiling. The hammer chopped through dirt, hooked about stone. Pebbles and dust fell all around the barbarian and his attacker. Again and again, all the while singing, Wulfgar slammed at the ceiling. The yochlol, not a stupid beast, bit fiercely, shook its great maw wildly, but Wulfgar had passed beyond the admission of pain. Aegis-fang chopped upward; a chunk of stone followed its inevitable descent. As soon as she recovered her wits, Catti-brie saw what the barbarian was doing. The yochlol was no longer interested in her, was no longer pulling her in, and she managed to claw her way back to her bow. \"No, me boy!\" she heard Bruenor cry from across the way. Catti-brie nocked an arrow and turned about. Aegis-fang slammed against the ceiling. Catti-brie\u0027s arrow sizzled into the yochlol an instant before the ceiling gave way. Huge boulders toppled down; any space between them quickly filled with piles of rock and soil, spewing clouds of dust into the air. The chamber shook violently; the collapse resounded through all the tunnels. Neither Catti-brie nor Bruenor still stood. Both huddled on the floor, their arms defensively over their heads as the cave-in slowly ended. Neither could see amid the darkness and the dust; neither could see that both the monster and Wulfgar had disappeared under tons of collapsing stone. Part 5 End Game When I die... I have lost friends, lost my father, my mentor, to I that greatest of mysteries called death. Ihave known I grief since the day I left my homeland, since the day wicked Malice informed me that Zaknafein had been given to the Spider Queen. It is a strange emotion, grief, its focus shifting. Do I grieve for Zaknafein, for Montolio, for Wulfgar? Or do I grieve for myself, for the loss I must forever endure?It is perhaps the most basic question of mortal existence, and yet it is one for which there can be no answer.... Unless the answer is one of faith. I am sad still when I think of the sparring games against my father, when I remember the walks beside Montolio through the mountains, and when those memories of Wulfgar, most intense of all, flash through my mind like a summary of the last several years of my life. I remember a day on Kelvin\u0027s Cairn, looking out over the tundra of Icewind Dale, when young Wulfgar and I spotted the campfires of his nomadic people. That was the moment when Wulfgar and I truly became friends, the moment when we came to learn that, for all the other uncertainties in both our lives, we would have each other. I remember the white dragon, Icingdeath, and the giant-kin, Biggrin, and how, without heroic Wulfgar at my side, I would have perished in either of those fights. I remember, too, sharing the victories with my friend, our bond of trust and love tightening - close, but never uncomfortable. I was not there when he fell, could not lend him the support he certainly would have lent me. I could not say \"Farewell!\" When I die, will I be alone? If not for the weapons of monsters or the clutch of disease, I surely will outlive Catti-brie and Regis, even Bruenor. At this time in my life I do firmly believe that, no matter who else might be beside me, if those three were not, I would indeed die alone. These thoughts are not so dark. I have said farewell to Wulfgar a thousand times. I have said it every time I let him know how dear he was to me, every time my words or actions affirmed our love. Farewell is said by the living, in life, every day. It is said with love and friendship, with the affirmation that the memories are lasting if the flesh is not. Wulfgar has found another place, another life - I have to believe that, else what is the point of existence? My very real grief is for me, for the loss I know I will feel to the end of my days, however many centuries have passed. But within that loss is a serenity, a divine calm. Better to have known Wulfgar and shared those very events that now fuel my grief, than never to have walked beside him, fought beside him, looked at the world through his crystal-blue eyes. When I die . . . may there be friends who will grieve for me, who will carry our shared joys and pains, who will carry my memory. This is the immortality of the spirit, the ever-lingering legacy, the fuel of grief . But so, too, the fuel of faith.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-20.html","bookId":2127,"book":{"id":2127,"title":"The Legacy (Legacy of the Drow #1)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #1: The Legacy A new mass market edition of the New York Times best-selling sword and sorcery classic, The Legacy is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best!
