{"id":94065,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Regis and Drizzt pulled up in a small side chamber, its ceiling relatively clear of the persistent stalactites common in this region of caves, and its entryway low and defensible. \"Should I put out the torch?\" the halfling asked. He stood behind Drizzt as the drow crouched in front of the entryway, listening for sounds of movement in the main tunnel beyond. Drizzt thought for a long moment, then shook his head, knowing that it really did not matter, that he and Regis had no chance of escaping these tunnels without further confrontation. Soon after they had fled the battle, Drizzt discovered other enemies paralleling them down side corridors. He knew the dark elf hunting techniques well enough to understand that the trap would not be set with any obvious openings. \"I fight better in the light than my kin, I would guess,\" Drizzt reasoned. \"At least it wasn\u0027t Entreri,\" Regis said lightly, and Drizzt thought the reference to the assassin a strange thing indeed. Would that it were Artemis Entreri! the drow mused. At least then he and Regis would not be surrounded by a horde of drow warriors! \"You did well in dismissing Guenhwyvar,\" Drizzt remarked. \"Would the panther have died?\" Regis asked. Drizzt honestly did not know the answer, but he did not believe that Guenhwyvar had been in any mortal peril. He had seen the panther dragged into the stone by a creature of the elemental plane of earth and plunged into a magically created lake of pure acid. Both times the panther had returned to him and eventually all of Guenhwyvar\u0027s wounds had healed. \"If the drow and the drider had been allowed to continue,\" he added, \"it is likely that Guenhwyvar would have needed more time to mend wounds on the Astral Plane. I do not believe the panther can be killed away from its home, however, not as long as the figurine survives.\" Drizzt looked back to Regis, sincere gratitude on his handsome face. \"You did well in sending Guenhwyvar away, though, for certainly the panther was suffering at the hands of our enemies.\" \"I\u0027m glad Guenhwyvar would not die,\" Regis commented as Drizzt looked back to the entryway. \"It would not do to lose so valuable a magical item.\" Nothing Regis had said since his return from Calimport, nothing Regis had ever said to Drizzt, seemed so very out of place. No, it went further than that, Drizzt decided as he crouched there, stunned by his halfling companion\u0027s callous remark. Guenhwyvar and Regis had been more than companions, had been friends, for many years. Regis would never refer to Guenhwyvar as a magical item. Suddenly, it all began to make sense to the dark elf: the halfling\u0027s references to Artemis Entreri now, back with the dead dwarves, and back when they had talked of what had happened in Calimport after Drizzt\u0027s departure. Now Drizzt understood the eager way in which Regis measured his responses to remarks about the assassin. And Drizzt understood the viciousness of his fight with Wulfgar - hadn\u0027t the barbarian mentioned that it was Regis who had told him about Drizzt\u0027s meeting with Catti-brie outside Mithril Hall? \"What else did you tell Wulfgar?\" Drizzt asked, not turning around, not flinching in the least. \"What else did you convince him of with that ruby pendant that hangs about your neck?\" The little mace skipped noisily across the floor beside the drew, coming to rest several feet to the front and side of him. Then came another item, a mask that Drizzt himself had worn on his journey to the southern empires, a mask that had allowed Drizzt to alter his appearance to that of a surface elf. Wulfgar eyed the outrageous dwarf curiously, not quite sure what to make of this unorthodox battlerager. Bruenor had introduced Pwent to the barbarian just a minute before, and Wulfgar had gotten the distinct impression that Bruenor wasn\u0027t overly fond of the black-bearded, smelly dwarf. The dwarf king, to take his seat between Cobble and Catti-brie, had then rushed across the audience hall, leaving Wulfgar awkwardly standing by the door. Thibbledorf Pwent, though, seemed perfectly at ease. \"You are a warrior, then?\" Wulfgar asked politely, hoping to find some common ground. Pwent\u0027s burst of laughter mocked him. \"Warrior?\" the bawdy dwarf bellowed. \"Ye mean, one who\u0027s for fighting with honor?\" Wulfgar shrugged, having no idea of where Pwent was leading. \"Is yerself a warrior, big boy?\" Pwent asked. Wulfgar puffed out his great chest. \"I am Wulfgar, son of Beornegar...\" he began somberly. \"I thinked as much,\" Pwent called across the room to the others. \"And if ye was fighting another, and he tripped on his way in and dropped his weapon, ye\u0027d stand back and let him pick it up, knowing that ye\u0027d win the fight anyway,\" Pwent reasoned. Wulfgar shrugged, the answer obvious. \"Ye realize Pwent will surely insult the boy,\" Cobble, leaning on the arm of Bruenor\u0027s chair, whispered to the dwarf king. \"Gold against silver on the boy, then,\" Bruenor offered quietly. \"Pwent\u0027s good and wild, but he ain\u0027t got the strength to handle that one.\" \"Not a bet I\u0027d take,\" Cobble replied, \"but if Wulfgar lifts a hand against that one, he\u0027s to get stung, not to doubt.\" \"Good,\" Catti-brie put in unexpectedly. Both Bruenor and Cobble turned incredulous looks on the young woman. \"Wulfgar\u0027s needing some stinging,\" she explained with uncharacteristic callousness. . \"Well, there ye have it then!\" Pwent roared in Wulfgar\u0027s face, leading the barbarian across the room as he spoke. \"If I was fighting anyone, if I was fighting yerself, and ye dropped yer weapon, I\u0027d let ye bend and pick it up.\" Wulfgar nodded in agreement, but jumped back as Pwent snapped his dirty fingers right under Wulfgar\u0027s nose. \"And then I\u0027d put me spike right through the top o\u0027 yer thick head!\" the battlerager finished. \"I ain\u0027t no damned stupid warrior, ye damned fool! I\u0027m a battlerager, the battlerager, and don\u0027t ye ever forget that the Pwent plays to win!\" He snapped his fingers again Wulfgar\u0027s way, then stormed past the stunned barbarian, stomping over to stand before Bruenor. \"Ye got some outrageous friends, but I\u0027m not surprised,\" Pwent roared at Bruenor. He regarded Catti-brie with his broken-toothed smile. \"But yer girl\u0027d be a cute one if ye could find a way to put some hair on her chin.\" \"Take it as a compliment,\" Cobble quietly offered to Catti-brie, who only shrugged and smiled with amusement. \"Battlehammers always kept a soft spot in their hearts for them that wasn\u0027t dwarf-kin,\" Pwent went on, directing his remarks at Wulfgar as the tall man moved beside him. \"And we let \u0027em be our kings anyway. Never could figure that part out.\" Bruenor\u0027s knuckles whitened under the strain as he grabbed hard on the arms of his chair, trying to control himself. Catti-brie dropped a hand over his, and when he looked at her tolerant eyes, the storm quickly passed. \"Speaking of that,\" Pwent went on, \"there\u0027s an ugly rumor making the rounds that ye\u0027ve got a drow elf standing beside ye. There be any truth o\u0027 that?\" Bruenor\u0027s first reaction was one of anger - always the dwarf had been defensive about his oft-maligned drow friend. Catti-brie spoke first, though, her words directed more to her father than to Pwent, a reminder to Bruenor that Drizzt\u0027s skin had thickened and that he could take care of himself. \"Ye\u0027ll be meeting the drow soon enough,\" she told the battlerager. \"Suren that one\u0027s a warrior to fit yer description, if ever there was one.\" Pwent roared in derisive laughter, but it faded as Catti-brie continued. \"If ye came at him to start a fight, but dropped yer pointy helm, he\u0027d pick it up for ye and put it back on yer head,\" she explained. \"Of course, then he\u0027d take it back off and stuff it down the back of yer pants, and give ye a few boots, just so ye\u0027d get \u0027the Pwent.\u0027\" The battlerager\u0027s lips seemed to tie themselves up in a neat knot. For the first time in many days, Wulfgar seemed to approve completely of Catti-brie\u0027s reasoning, and the nod of his head, and of Bruenor\u0027s and of Cobble\u0027s, was certainly appreciative when Pwent made no move to answer. \"How long will Drizzt be gone?\" the barbarian asked, to change the subject before Pwent could find his irritating voice. \"The tunnels are long,\" Bruenor replied. \"He will return for the ceremony?\" Wulfgar asked, and there seemed to Catti-brie to be some ambivalence in his tone, an uncertainty of which answer he would prefer. \"Be sure that he will,\" the young woman put in evenly. \"For be sure that there\u0027ll be no wedding until Drizzt is back from the tunnels.\" She looked at Bruenor, thoroughly squashing his protests before he ever uttered them. \"And I\u0027m not for caring if all the kings and queens of the North are kept waiting a month!\" Wulfgar seemed on the verge of an explosion, but he was wise enough to direct his mounting anger away from volatile Catti-brie. \"I should have gone with him!\" he growled at Bruenor. \"Why did you send Regis along? What good might the halfling do if enemies are found?\" The ferocity of the lad\u0027s tone caught Bruenor off his guard. \"He\u0027s right,\" Catti-brie snapped in her father\u0027s ear, not that she wanted to agree with Wulfgar on any point, but that she, like Wulfgar, saw the opportunity to vent her anger openly. Bruenor sank back in his chair, his dark eyes darting from one to the other. \"Dwarves\u0027re lost, is all,\" he said. \"Even if that is true, what will Regis do but slow down the drow?\" Catti-brie reasoned. \"He said he\u0027d find a way to fit in!\" Bruenor protested. \"Who said?\" Catti-brie demanded. \"Rumblebelly!\" shouted her flustered father. \"He did not even wish to go!\" Wulfgar shot back. \"Did too!\" Bruenor roared, leaping up from his seat and pushing the leaning Wulfgar back two steps with a sturdy forearm slam to the lad\u0027s chest. \"\u0027Twas Rumblebelly that telled me to send him along with the drow, I tell ye!\" \"Regis was here with yerself when ye got the news o\u0027 the missing dwarves,\" Catti-brie reasoned. \"Ye didn\u0027t say a thing about Regis telling ye to send him.\" \"He telled me before that,\" Bruenor answered. \"He telled . . .\" The dwarf stopped suddenly, realizing the illogic of it all. Somehow, somewhere in the back of his mind, he remembered Regis explaining that he and Drizzt should go after the missing dwarves, but how could that be, since Bruenor had made the decision as soon as they all learned that dwarves were missing? \"Have ye been tasting the holy water again, me king?\" Cobble asked respectfully but firmly. Bruenor held his hand out, motioning for them all to be quiet while he sought his recollections. He remembered Regis\u0027s words distinctly and knew he was not imagining them, but no images accompanied the memory, no scene where he could place the halfling and thus straighten out the apparent time discrepancy. Then an image came to Bruenor, a swirling array of shining facets, spiraling down and drawing him with them into the depths of a wondrous ruby. \"Rumblebelly telled me that the dwarves\u0027d be missing,\" Bruenor said slowly and clearly, his eyes closed as he forced the memory from his subconscious. \"He telled me I should send himself, and Drizzt, to find them, that them two alone\u0027d get me dwarves back to the halls safely.\" \"Regis could not have known,\" Cobble reasoned, obviously doubting Bruenor\u0027s words. \"And even if he did, the little one would not have wished to go along to find them,\" Wulfgar added, equally doubtful. \"Is this a dream - ?\" \"Not a dream!\" Bruenor growled. \"He telled me ... with that ruby of his.\" Bruenor\u0027s face screwed up as he tried to remember, tried to call upon his dwarven resistance to magic to fight past the stubborn mental block. \"Regis would not - \" Wulfgar started to say again, but this time it was Catti-brie, knowing the truth of her father\u0027s claims, who interrupted him. \"Unless it wasn\u0027t really Regis,\" she offered, and her own words made her mouth drop open with their terrible implications. The three had been through much beside Drizzt, and they all knew well that the drow had many evil and powerful enemies, one in particular who would have the wiles to create such an elaborate deception. Wulfgar looked equally stricken, at a loss, but Bruenor was fast to react. He jumped down from the throne and blasted between Wulfgar and Pwent, nearly knocking them both from their feet. Catti-brie went right behind, Wulfgar turning to follow. \"What in the head of a goblin are them three talking about?\" Pwent demanded of Cobble as the cleric, too, rambled past. \"A fight,\" Cobble replied, knowing well how to deflect any of Pwent\u0027s demands for a lengthy explanation. Thibbledorf Pwent dropped to one knee and rolled his burly shoulder, punching his fist triumphantly out in front of him. \"Yeeeeeah!\" he cried in glee. \"Suren it\u0027s good to be back serving a Battlehammer!\" \"Are you in league with them, or is this all a terrible coincidence?\" Drizzt asked dryly, still refusing to turn about and give Artemis Entreri the satisfaction of viewing his torment. \"I do not believe in coincidence,\" came the predictable answer. Finally, Drizzt did turn around, to see his dreaded rival, the human assassin Artemis Entreri, standing easily at the ready, fine sword in one hand, jeweled dagger in the other. The torch, still burning, lay at his feet. The magical transformation from halfling to human had been complete, clothing included, and this fact somewhat confused Drizzt. When Drizzt had used the mask, it had done no more than alter the color of his skin and hair, and his amazement now was obvious on his face. \"You should better learn the value of magical items before you so casually toss them aside,\" the assassin said to him, understanding the look. There was a note of truth in Entreri\u0027s words, apparently, but Drizzt had never regretted leaving the magical mask in Calimport. Under its protective camouflage, the dark elf had walked freely, without persecution, among the other races. But under that mask, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had walked in a lie. \"You could have killed me in the goblin fight, or a hundred other times since your return to Mithril Hall,\" Drizzt reasoned. \"Why the elaborate games?\" \"The sweeter comes my victory.\" \"You wish me to draw my weapons, to continue the fight we began in Calimport\u0027s sewers.\" \"Our fight began long before there, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" the assassin chided. He casually poked his blade at Drizzt, who neither flinched nor reached for his scimitars as the fine sword nicked him on the cheek. \"You and I,\" Entreri continued, and he began to circle to Drizzt\u0027s side, \"have been mortal enemies from the day we learned of each other, each an insult to the other\u0027s code of fighting. I mock your principles, and you insult my discipline.\" \"Discipline and emptiness are not the same,\" Drizzt answered. \"You are but a shell that knows how to use weapons. There is no substance in that.\" \"Good,\" Entreri purred, tapping Drizzt\u0027s hip with his sword. \"I feel your anger, drow, though you try so desperately to hide it. Draw your weapons and let it loose. Teach me with your skills what your words cannot.\" \"You still do not understand,\" Drizzt replied calmly, his head cocked to the side and a smug, sincere grin widening on his face. \"I would not presume to teach you anything. Artemis Entreri is not worth my time.\" Entreri\u0027s eyes flared in sudden rage and he leaped forward, sword high as if to strike Drizzt down. Drizzt didn\u0027t flinch. \"Draw your weapons and let us continue our destiny,\" Entreri growled, falling back and leveling his sword at the draw\u0027s eye level. \"Fall on your own blade and meet the only end you\u0027ll ever deserve,\" Drizzt replied. \"I have your cat!\" Entreri snapped. \"You must fight me, or Guenhwyvar will be mine.\" \"You forget that we are both soon to be captured - or killed,\" Drizzt reasoned. \"Do not underestimate the hunting skills of my people.\" \"Then fight for the halfling,\" Entreri growled. Drizzt\u0027s expression showed that the assassin had hit a nerve. \"Had you forgotten about Regis?\" Entreri teased. \"I have not killed him, but he will die where he is, and only I know of that place. I will tell you only if you win. Fight, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, if for no better reason than to save the life of that miserable halfling!\" Entreri\u0027s sword made a lazy thrust at Drizzt\u0027s face again, but this time it went flying wide to the side as a scimitar leaped out and banged it away. Entreri sent it right back in, and followed it closely with a dagger strike that nearly found a hole hi Drizzt\u0027s defenses. \"I thought you had lost the use of an arm and an eye,\" the drow said. \"1 lied,\" Entreri replied, stepping back and holding his weapons out wide. \"Must I be punished?\" Drizzt let his scimitars answer for him, rushing in quickly and chopping repeatedly, left and right, left and right, then right a third time as his left blade twirled up above his head and came straight ahead in a blinding thrust. Sword and dagger countering, the assassin batted aside each attack. The fight became a dance, movements too synchronous, too much in perfect harmony for either to gain an advantage. Drizzt, knowing that time was running out for him, and more particularly for Regis, maneuvered near the low-burning torch, then stomped down on it, rolling it about and smothering the flames, stealing the light. He thought his racial night vision would gain him the edge, but when he looked at Entreri, he saw the assassin\u0027s eyes glowing in the telltale red of infravision. \"You thought the mask gave me this ability?\" Entreri reasoned. \"Not true, you see. It was a gift from my dark elf associate, a mercenary, not so unlike myself.\" His words ended at the beginning of his charge, his sword coming high and forcing Drizzt to twist and duck to the side. Drizzt grinned in satisfaction as Twinkle came up, the scimitar ringing as it knocked Entreri\u0027s dagger aside. A subtle twist put Drizzt back on the offensive. Twinkle coming around Entreri\u0027s dagger hand and slicing at the assassin\u0027s exposed chest. Entreri already had begun to roll, straight backward, and the blade never got close. In the dim light of Twinkle\u0027s glow, their skin colors lost in a common gray, they seemed alike, brethren come from the same mold. Entreri approved of that perception, but Drizzt surely did not. To the renegade drow, Artemis Entreri seemed a dark mirror of his soul, an image of what he might have become had he remained in Menzoberranzan beside his amoral kin. Drizzt\u0027s rage led him now in another series of dazzling thrusts and cunning, sweeping cuts, his curved blades weaving tight lines about each other, hitting at Entreri from a different angle with every attack. Sword and dagger played equally well, blocking and returning cunning counters, then blocking the countering counters that the assassin seemed to anticipate with ease. Drizzt could fight him forever, would never tire with Entreri standing opposite him. But then he felt a sting in his calf and a burning, then numbing, sensation emanating throughout his leg. In seconds, he felt his reflexes slowing. He wanted to shout out the truth, to steal the moment of Entreri\u0027s victory, for surely the assassin, who so desired to beat Drizzt in honest combat, would not appreciate a win brought on by the poisoned quarrel of hidden allies. Twinkle\u0027s tip dipped to the floor and Drizzt realized he was dangerously vulnerable. Entreri fell first, similarly poisoned. Drizzt sensed the dark shapes slipping in through the low door and wondered if he had time to bash in the fallen assassin\u0027s skull before he, too, slumped to the ground. He heard one of his own blades, then the other, clang to the floor, but he was not aware that he had dropped them. Then he was down, his eyes closed, his dimming consciousness trying to fathom the extent of this disaster, the many implications for his friends and for him. His thoughts were not eased with the last words he heard, a voice in the drow language, a voice from somewhere in his past. \"Sleep well, my lost brother.\" Part 3 Legacy What dangerous paths I have trod in my life; what I crooked ways these feet have walked, in my home-I land, in the tunnels of the Underdark, across the surface Northland, and even in the course of following my friends. I shake my head in wonderment - is every corner of the wide world possessed of people so self-absorbed that they cannot let others cross the paths of their lives? People so filled with hatred that they must take up chase and vindicate themselves against perceived wrongs, even if those wrongs were no more than an honest defense against their own encroaching evils? I left Artemis Entreri in Calimport, left him there in body and with my taste for vengeance rightfully sated. Our paths had crossed and separated, to the betterment of us both. Entreri had no practical reason to pursue me, had nothing to gain in finding me but the possible redemption of his injured pride. What a fool he is. He has found perfection of the body, has honed his fighting skills as perfectly as any I have known. But his need to pursue reveals his weakness. As we uncover the mysteries of the body, so too must we unravel the harmonies of the soul. But Artemis Entreri, for all his physical prowess, will never know what songs his spirit might sing. Always will he listen jealously for the harmonies of others, absorbed with bringing down anything that threatens his craven superiority. So much like my people is he, and so much like many others I have met, of varied races: barbarian warlords whose positions of power hinge on their ability to wage war on enemies who are not enemies; dwarf kings who hoard riches beyond imagination, while when sharing but a pittance of their treasures could better the lives of all those around them and in turn allow them to take down their ever-present military defenses and throw away their consuming paranoia; haughty elves who avert their eyes to the sufferings of any who are not elven, feeling that the \"lesser races\" somehow brought their pains unto themselves. I have run from these people, passed these people by, and heard countless stories of them from travelers of every known land. And I know now that I must battle them, not with blade or army, but by remaining true to what I know in my heart is the rightful course of harmony. By the grace of the gods, I am not alone. Since Bruenor regained his throne, the neighboring peoples take hope in his promises that the dwarven treasures of Mithril Hall will better all the region. Catti-brie\u0027s devotion to her principles is no less than my own, and Wulfgar has shown his warrior people the better way of friendship, the way of harmony. They are my armor, my hope in what is to come for me and for all the world. And as the lost chasers such as Entreri inevitably find their paths linked once more with my own, I remember Zaknafein, kindred of blood and soul. I remember Montolio and take heart that there are others who know the truth, that if I am destroyed, my ideals will not die with me. Because of the friends I have known, the honorable people I have met, I know I am no solitary hero of unique causes. I know that when 1 die, that which is important will live on. This is my legacy; by the grace of the gods, I am not alone.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-11.html","bookId":2127,"book":{"id":2127,"title":"The Legacy (Legacy of the Drow #1)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #1: The Legacy A new mass market edition of the New York Times best-selling sword and sorcery classic, The Legacy is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best!
