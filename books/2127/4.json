{"id":94058,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The Eighth King of Mithril Hall, leading his four friends and two hundred dwarven soldiers, was more appropriately arrayed for battle than for parley. Bruenor wore his battered, one-horned helmet, the other horn having long ago been broken away, and a fine suit of mithril armor, vertical lines of the silvery metal running the length of his stout torso and glittering in the torchlight. His shield bore the foaming mug standard of Clan Battlehammer in solid gold, and his customary axe, showing the nicks of a thousand battle kills (and a fair number of them goblins!) was ready in a loop on his belt, within easy reach. Wulfgar, in a suit of natural hide, a wolf\u0027s head set in front of his great chest, walked behind the dwarf, with Aegis-fang, his warhammer, angled out across the crook of his elbow in front of him. Catti-brie, Taulmaril over her shoulder, walked beside him, but the two said little, and the tension between them was obvious. Drizzt flanked the dwarf king on his right, Regis scampering to keep up beside him, and Guenhwyvar, the sleek, proud panther, muscles rippling with every stride, moved to the right of the two, darting off into the shadows whenever the low and uneven corridor widened. Many of the dwarves marching behind the five friends carried torches, and the flickering light created monsterlike shadows, keeping the companions on their guard - not that they were likely to be surprised marching beside Drizzt and Guenhwyvar. The dark elf\u0027s black panther companion was all too adept at leading the way. And nothing would care to surprise this group. The whole of the force was bedecked for battle, with great, sturdy helms and armor and fine weapons. Every one of the dwarves carried a hammer or axe for distance shots and another nasty weapon in case any enemies got in close. Four dwarves in a line near the middle of the contingent supported a great wooden beam across their stocky shoulders. Others near them carried huge, circular slabs of stone with the centers cut out. Heavy rope, long notched poles, chains, and sheets of pliable metal all were evident among this section of the brigade as the tools for a \"goblin toy,\" as Bruenor had explained to his nondwarven companions\u0027 curious expressions. In looking at the heavy pieces, Drizzt could well imagine how much fun the goblins would get from this particular contraption. At an intersection where a wide passage ran to their right they found a pile of giant bones, with two great skulls sitting atop it, each of them large enough for the halfling to crawl completely into. \"Ettin,\" Bruenor explained, for it was he, as a beardless lad, who had felled the monsters. At the next intersection they met up with General Dagna and the lead force, another three hundred battle-hardened dwarves. \"Parley\u0027s set,\" Dagna explained. \"Goblins\u0027re down a thousand feet in a wide chamber.\" \"Ye\u0027ll be flanking?\" Bruenor asked him. \"Aye, but so\u0027re the goblins,\" the commander explained. \"Four hundred of the things if there\u0027s a one. I sent Cobble and his three hundred on a wide course, around the backside o\u0027 the room to cut off any escape.\" Bruenor nodded. The worst that they could expect was roughly even odds, and Bruenor would put any one of his dwarves against five of the goblin scum. \"I\u0027m going straight in with a hundred,\" the dwarf king explained. \"Another hundred\u0027re going to the right, with the toy, and the left\u0027s for yerself. Don\u0027t ye let me down if I\u0027m needin\u0027 ye!\" Dagna\u0027s chuckle reflected supreme confidence, but then his expression turned abruptly grave. \"Should it be yerself doing the talking?\" he asked Bruenor. \"I\u0027m not for trusting goblins.\" \"Oh, they\u0027ve got a trick for me, or I\u0027m a bearded gnome,\" Bruenor replied, \"but this goblin crew ain\u0027t seen the likes o\u0027 dwarves in hunnerds o\u0027 years, unless I miss me guess, and they\u0027re sure to think less of us than they should.\" They exchanged a heavy handshake, and Dagna stormed off, the hard boots of his three hundred soldiers echoing through the corridors like the rumbling of a gathering thunderstorm. \"Stealth was never a dwarven strong point,\" Drizzt remarked dryly. Regis let his stare linger for many moments on the departing host\u0027s crack formations, then turned the other way to regard the other group, bearing the beam, stone disks, and other items. \"If ye\u0027ve not got the belly for it. . .\" Bruenor began, interpreting the halfling\u0027s interest as fear. \"I am here, aren\u0027t I?\" Regis came back sharply, rudely actually, and the uncustomary edge to his voice made his friends regard him curiously. But then, in a peculiarly Regis-like movement, the halfling straightened his belt under his prominent paunch, squared his shoulders, and looked away. The others managed a laugh at Regis\u0027s expense, but Drizzt continued to stare at him curiously. Regis was indeed \"here,\" but why he had come, the drow did not know. To say that Regis was not fond of battle was as much an understatement as to say that the halfling was not fond of missing meals. A few minutes later the hundred soldiers remaining behind their king entered the appointed chamber, coming in through a large archway onto a raised section of stone, several feet up from the wide floor of the huge main area, wherein stood the goblin host. Drizzt noted with more than passing curiosity that this particular raised section held no stalagmite mounds, which seemed to be common throughout the rest of the chamber. Many stalactites leered down from the not-too-high ceiling above Drizzt\u0027s head; why hadn\u0027t their drippings left the commonplace stone mounds? Drizzt and Guenhwyvar moved to one side, out of the range of the torches, which the drow, with his exceptional vision, did not need. Slipping into the shadows of a grouping of low-hanging stalactites, the two seemed to disappear. So did Regis, not far behind Drizzt. \"Gave up the high ground afore we ever started,\" Bruenor whispered to Wulfgar and Catti-brie. \"Ye\u0027d think even goblins\u0027d be smarter than that!\" That notion gave the dwarf pause, and he glanced around to the edges of the raised section, taking note that this slab of stone had been worked - worked with tools - to fit into this section of the cavern. His dark eyes narrowed with suspicion as Bruenor looked to the area where Drizzt had disappeared. \"I\u0027m thinking that it\u0027s a good thing we\u0027re up high for the parley,\" Bruenor said, too loudly. Drizzt understood. \"The whole section is trapped,\" Regis, right behind the drow, remarked. Drizzt nearly jumped, amazed that the halfling had gotten so close to him and wondering what magical item Regis carried to make his movements so silent. Following the halfling\u0027s leading gaze, Drizzt regarded the nearest edge of the platform and a pillar half out from under the stone, a slender stalagmite that had been recently decapitated. \"A good hit would bring it down,\" Regis reasoned. \"Stay here,\" Drizzt instructed, agreeing with the crafty halfling\u0027s estimate. Perhaps the goblins had spent some time in preparing this battlefield. Drizzt moved out into view of the dwarves, gave Bruenor some signals to indicate that he would check it out, then slipped away, Guenhwyvar moving parallel to him, not far to the side. All the dwarves had entered the chamber by then, with Bruenor cautiously keeping them back, lined end to end against the back edge of the semicircular platform. Bruenor, with Wulfgar and Catti-brie flanking him, came out a few steps to regard the goblin host. There were well over a hundred - maybe two hundred - of the smelly things in the darker area of the chamber, judging from the many sets of red-shining eyes staring back at the dwarf. \"We came to talk,\" Bruenor called out in the guttural goblin tongue, \"as agreed.\" \"Talk,\" came a goblin reply, surprisingly in the Common tongue. \"Whats will dwarfses offer to Gar-yak and his thousands?\" \"Thousands?\" Wulfgar remarked. \"Goblins cannot count beyond their own fingers,\" Catti-brie reminded him. \"Get on yer toes,\" Bruenor whispered to them both. \"This group\u0027s looking for a fight. I can smell it.\" Wulfgar gave Catti-brie a positively superior look, but his juvenile bluster was lost, for the young woman was paying him no heed. Drizzt slipped from shadow to shadow, around boulders, and, finally, over the lip of the raised platform. As he and Regis had expected, this section, supported along its front end by several shortened stalagmite pillars, was not a solid piece, but a worked slab propped in place. And, as expected, the goblins planned to drop the front end of the platform and spill the dwarves. Great iron wedges had been driven partway through the front supporting line of pillars, waiting for a hammer to drive them through. It was no goblin poised underneath the stone to spring the trap, however, but another two-headed giant, an ettin. Even lying flat, it was nearly as tall as Drizzt; he guessed it would tower at least twelve feet high if it ever got upright. Its arms, as thick as the drow\u0027s chest, were bare, it held a great spiked club in either hand, and its two huge heads stared at each other, apparently holding a conversation. Drizzt didn\u0027t know whether the goblins intended to honestly parley, dropping the stone slab only if the dwarves made move to attack, but with the appearance of the dangerous giant, he wasn\u0027t willing to take any chances. Using the cover of the farthest pillar, he rolled under the lip and disappeared into the blackness behind and to the side of the waiting giant. When a cat\u0027s green eyes stared back at Drizzt from across the breadth of the prone giant, he knew that Guenhwyvar, too, had moved silently into position. A torch went up among the goblin ranks, and three of the four-foot-tall, yellow-skinned creatures ambled forward. \"Well,\" Bruenor grumbled, already tired of this meeting. \"Which one of ye dogs is Gar-yak?\" \"Gar-yak back with others,\" the tallest of the group answered, looking over his sloping shoulder to the main host. \"A sure sign there\u0027s to be trouble,\" Catti-brie muttered, unobtrusively slipping her great bow from her shoulder. \"When the leader\u0027s safely back, the goblins mean to fight.\" \"Go tell yer Gar-yak that we don\u0027t have to kill ye,\" Bruenor said firmly. \"Me name\u0027s Bruenor Battlehammer - \" \"Battlehammer?\" The goblin spat, apparently recognizing the name. \"Yous is king dwarf?\" Bruenor\u0027s lips did not move as he mumbled to his companions, \"Be ready.\" Catti-brie\u0027s hand came to rest on the quiver at her side. Bruenor nodded. \"King!\" the goblin hooted, looking back to the monster host and pointing excitedly Bruenor\u0027s way. The ready dwarves understood the cue for the onslaught faster than the stupid goblins, and the next calls from the chamber were dwarven battle cries. Drizzt took the call to action faster than the dim-witted ettin. The creature swung its clubs back, then yelped in pain and surprise as the six-hundred-pound panther clamped onto one wrist and a wickedly edged scimitar dove into its armpit on the other side. The monster\u0027s huge heads turned outward in a weird, synchronous movement, one to regard Drizzt, one toward Guenhwyvar. Before the ettin ever knew what was happening, Drizzt\u0027s second scimitar slashed across its bulging eyes. The giant tried to squirm about to get to the stinging elf, but the agile Drizzt slipped under its arm and came in hard and fast at the monster\u0027s vulnerable heads. Across the way, Guenhwyvar dug teeth into flesh and set claws into stone, holding fast the monster\u0027s arm. \"Drizzt got him!\" Bruenor reasoned when the floor bucked beneath him. With the failure of the simple, if not clever, trap, the goblins had indeed surrendered the favorable high ground. The stupid creatures hooted and whooped and came on anyway, launching crude spears, most of which never reached their targets. More effective was the dwarven response. Catti-brie led it, putting the Heartseeker up in an instant and loosing a magical, silver-shafted arrow that seemed to trail lightning in its deadly flight. It blasted a clean, smoking hole through one goblin, did likewise to a second farther back, and drove into the chest of a third. All three dropped to the floor. A hundred dwarves roared and charged forward, heaving axes and warhammers into the charging goblin throng. Catti-brie fired again, and then again, and, with just the three shots, her kill count was up to eight. Now it was her turn to give Wulfgar a superior stare, and the barbarian, humbled, promptly looked away. The floor bucked wildly; Bruenor heard the roars of the wounded giant beneath him. \"Down!\" the dwarf king commanded above the sudden roar of battle. The ferocious dwarves needed little encouragement, for the leading goblins were close to the platform by then. Out came living dwarven missiles, crushing into the goblin ranks, flailing away with fists and boots and weapons before they even stopped bouncing. A supporting pillar cracked in half as the ettin inadvertently struck it, trying to bring its club around to get at Drizzt. Down came the platform, pinning the stupid beast. Drizzt, crouched safely below the level of the giant\u0027s girth, could not believe how badly the goblins - and the ettin - had thought out their plan. \"How did you ever mean to get out of here?\" he asked, though, of course, the ettin could not understand him. Drizzt shook his head, almost in pity, then his scimitars went to work on the monster\u0027s face and throat. A moment later, Guenhwyvar sprang onto the other head, claws raking deep gouges. In mere seconds, the ranger and his feline companion sprinted out from under the low-riding platform, their business finished. Knowing that his unique talents could be of better use in other ways, Drizzt avoided the wild melee of battle and moved to the side along the cavern wall. A dozen corridors led into this main chamber, he could see, and goblins were pouring in through nearly every one. Of more concern were the unexpected allies of the goblin forces, though, for, to Drizzt\u0027s surprise, he noticed several more gigantic ettins standing still and quiet behind stalagmites, waiting for the moment when they might join the fray. Catti-brie, still on the platform and firing into the goblin horde, was the first to spot Drizzt, halfway up a stalagmite mound to the left-hand side of the cavern and motioning back for her and Wulfgar. A goblin came up out of the fighting mass and charged the young woman, but Wulfgar stepped in front of her and whaled on it with his great hammer, sending it flying a dozen feet over the edge. The barbarian spun about as fast as he could, trying to ready a defense, for another goblin had come up to the side, closing with a spear point leading the way. It nearly got the spear in for a strike, but its head exploded under the impact of a silver-streaking arrow. \"Drizzt is needing us,\" Catti-brie explained, and she led the barbarian to their left along the tilting platform, Wulfgar running along the edge and pounding any goblins that tried to scramble up. When they were clear of the main fighting, Drizzt motioned for Catti-brie to hold her position and for Wulfgar to come forward cautiously. \"He has found some giants,\" Regis, hidden below the pair, explained to them, \"behind those mounds.\" Drizzt leaped down around the stalagmite, then came diving back out, turning defensive somersaults with an ettin in close pursuit, twin clubs ready to squash the drow. The giant jerked upright when Catti-brie\u0027s arrow thudded into its chest, scorching the filthy animal hide it wore. A second arrow knocked it off balance, then Wulfgar\u0027s hurled hammer, flying to the barbarian\u0027s resounding cries of \"Tempus!\" blasted the creature away. Guenhwyvar, still on the side of the mound, leaped atop the second ettin as it came barreling out, muscled claws raking viciously, blinding both the monster\u0027s heads until Drizzt got in close enough to put his scimitars to work. The next giant came around the other side of the mound, but Catti-brie was ready for it, and arrow after arrow slammed it, spun it around, and finally dropped it, dead, to the ground. Wulfgar charged forward, catching his magical war-hammer back in his grasp. Drizzt had finished with the giant by the time the barbarian caught up to him, and the dark elf joined his friend as they met the next of the charging monsters side by side. \"Like old times,\" Drizzt remarked. He didn\u0027t wait for an answer, but dove into a roll in front of Wulfgar. Both of them winced, blinded for an instant, as Catti-brie\u0027s next arrow sliced between them, slamming into the nearest giant\u0027s belly. \"She did that to make a point, you know,\" Drizzt remarked, and he didn\u0027t wait for an answer, but dove into a roll in front of Wulfgar. Understanding Drizzt\u0027s diversionary tactics, the barbarian heaved Aegis-fang right over the rolling form, and the ettin, stooping for a hit at Drizzt, caught the warhammer squarely on the side of one head. The other head remained alive, but dazed and disoriented for the split second it took to take control of the entire body. A split second was far too long when dealing with Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. The agile drow came up in a leap, easily avoiding a lumbering swing, and sent his scimitars in a crossing swipe that drew two parallel lines along the giant\u0027s throat. The ettin dropped both its clubs and clutched at the mortal wound. An arrow blew it to the ground. Two more ettins remained behind the mound, but they - all four heads - had seen quite enough of the fighting companions. Out a side tunnel the beasts went. Right into Dagna\u0027s rambling force. One wounded ettin stumbled back into the main chamber, a dozen hurled hammers bouncing off its stooped back for every lumbering step it took. Before Drizzt, Wulfgar, or even Catti-brie with her bow, could make a move at the beast, a multitude of dwarves rushed out of the tunnel and leaped upon it, bore it to the ground, and hacked and pounded away with battle-crazed abandon. Drizzt looked at Wulfgar and shrugged. \"Fear not, my friend,\" the barbarian replied, smiling. \"There are many more enemies to hit!\" With another bellow to his battle god, Wulfgar turned about and charged for the main fight, trying to pick out Bruenor\u0027s one-horned helmet amidst a writhing sea of tangled goblins and dwarves. Drizzt didn\u0027t follow, though, for he preferred single combat to the wildness of general melee. Calling Guenhwyvar to his side, the drow made his way along the wall, eventually exiting the main chamber. After only a few steps and a warning growl from his trusted panther ally, he came to realize that Regis wasn\u0027t far behind. Bruenor\u0027s estimates of the dwarven prowess seemed on target as the battle soon became a rout. In trading hits with the armored dwarves, the goblins found their crude swords and puny clubs to be no match against the tempered weapons of their enemies. Bruenor\u0027s people, too, were better trained, holding tight formations and keeping their nerves, which was difficult amidst all the chaos and the cries of the dying. Goblins fled by the dozen, most finding the line of Dagna and his charges eagerly waiting to kill them. With all the confusion, Catti-brie had to pick her shots carefully, particularly since she couldn\u0027t be certain that a skinny goblin torso would stop her flying arrows. Mostly, the young woman concentrated on those goblins breaking ranks, fleeing into the open ground between the main fight and Dagna\u0027s line. For all her talk of parley and all the accusations she had leveled at Bruenor and the others, the young woman could not deny the tingle, the adrenaline rush, that swept over her every time she lifted Taulmaril the Heartseeker. Wulfgar\u0027s eyes, too, gleamed with a luster that indicated the fine edge of survival. Raised among a warlike people, he had learned the battle-lust at an early age, a rage that had been tempered only when Bruenor and Drizzt had taught him the worth of his perceived enemies and the many sorrows his tribe\u0027s wars had caused. There was no guilt in this fight, though, not against evil goblins, and Wulfgar\u0027s charge from the dead ettins to the larger battle was accompanied by a hearty song to Tern-pus. Wulfgar found no target clear enough for him to chance a throw with his hammer, but he was not dismayed, particularly when a group of several goblins broke clear of the fighting and fled his way. The leading three hardly realized that the barbarian was there when Wulfgar\u0027s first sidelong cut with Aegis-fang swept them aside, killing two. The goblins behind stumbled in surprise, but came on anyway, flowing around the barbarian like a river around a rock. A goblin head exploded under Aegis-fang\u0027s next heavy blow; Wulfgar snapped the hammer across one-handed to deflect a sword, then followed with a punching left hook that shattered his would-be attacker\u0027s jaw and sent the creature flying. The barbarian felt a sting in his side, and he flinched before the sword could dig in deeply. His free hand whipped back across, clamping atop his attacker\u0027s head and lifting the squirming creature from the ground. It still had its sword, and Wulfgar realized that he was vulnerable. He found his only possible defense in sheer savagery, jerking the lifted goblin back and forth so violently that the creature could not get its bearings for a strike. Wulfgar spun around to drive his many attackers back, using his momentum to aid in his one-handed hammer swipe. An advancing goblin tried to backtrack, and lifted its arm in a pitiful defense, but the warhammer blasted through the skinny limb and crushed on, knocking the creature\u0027s head so powerfully that when the goblin fell to the ground, it landed on its back. Its face, too, was squarely against the stone. The stubborn, stupid goblin in the air nicked Wulfgar\u0027s huge biceps. The barbarian brought the creature down hard, squeezed and twisted, and heard the satisfying crack of neck bone. Seeing a coming charge from the corner of his eye, he hurled the dead thing at its companions, scattering them. \"Tempus!\" the barbarian roared. He took up his war-hammer in both hands and rushed into the bulk of the surrounding group, whipping Aegis-fang back and forth repeatedly. Any goblin that could not flee that furious charge, could not get out of deadly range, found a piece of its body utterly destroyed. Wulfgar pivoted and came back at the group he knew was behind him. The goblins had indeed begun an advance, but when the mighty warrior spun about, his face contorted in wild-eyed frenzy, the goblins turned about and ran away. Wulfgar heaved his hammer, crushing one, then pivoted again and rushed back the other way, at the other group. These, too, fled, apparently not caring that the wild human was unarmed. Wulfgar caught one of them by the elbow, spun it about to face him, and clamped his other hand over its face, bending it over backward to the ground. Aegis-fang reappeared in his hand, and the barbarian\u0027s fury doubled. Bruenor had to plant a boot solidly to free his many-notched axe from the chest of his latest victim. When the blade pulled free, a burst of blood followed it, showering the dwarf. Bruenor didn\u0027t care, sure that the goblins were evil things, that the results of his savage attacks bettered the world. Smiling with abandon, the dwarf king darted this way and that in the tight press, finally finding another target. The goblin swung first, its club smashing apart when it connected with Bruenor\u0027s fine shield. The stupid goblin stared at its broken weapon in disbelief, then looked at the dwarf just in time to see the axe dive between its eyes. A flash cut right by the dwarf, frightening the pleasure from him. He realized it was Catti-brie\u0027s doing, though, and saw the victim a dozen feet away, pinned to the stone floor by the quivering silver-shafted arrow. \"Damn good bow,\" the dwarf muttered, and in looking back to his daughter, he noticed a goblin scrambling up onto the platform. \"No, ye don\u0027t!\" the dwarf cried, rushing to the slab and diving into a roll atop it. He came up beside the creature, ready to exchange blows, when another flash forced him to jump back. The goblin still stood, looking down to its chest as though it expected to find an arrow sticking there. It found a hole instead, right through both lungs. The goblin poked a finger in, in a ridiculous attempt to stem the blood flow, then it fell dead. Bruenor planted his hands on hips and stared hard at his daughter. \"Hey, girl,\" he scolded. \"Ye\u0027re stealing all me fun!\" Catti-brie\u0027s fingers began to pull on her bowstring, but she relaxed it immediately. Bruenor considered the woman\u0027s curious action, then understood as a goblin club connected heavily with the back of his head. \"I left that one for yerself,\" Catti-brie said with a shrug, a lame movement when weighed against the glower of Bruenor\u0027s dark eyes. Bruenor wasn\u0027t listening. He threw his shield up, blocking the next predictable attack, and whirled, his axe leading the way. The goblin sucked in its belly and hopped back to its tiptoes. \"Not far enough,\" the dwarf told it, politely using its own tongue, and his words were proven true as the goblin\u0027s guts spilled out. The horrified creature regarded them in disbelief. \"Ye shouldn\u0027t be hitting me when I\u0027m not looking,\" was all the apology it would get from Bruenor Battlehammer, and his second swipe, angled in at the goblin\u0027s neck, took the creature\u0027s head from its shoulders. With the platform clear of enemies, both Bruenor and Catti-brie turned to regard the general battle. Catti-brie brought her bow up, but then didn\u0027t see the point of releasing any more arrows. Most of the goblins were in flight, but with Dagna\u0027s troops lined across the chamber, they had nowhere to go. Bruenor leaped down and put his forces into an organized pursuit, and, like a great, snapping maw, the dwarven hosts closed over the goblin horde.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-4.html","bookId":2127,"book":{"id":2127,"title":"The Legacy (Legacy of the Drow #1)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #1: The Legacy A new mass market edition of the New York Times best-selling sword and sorcery classic, The Legacy is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best!
