{"id":94055,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"The rogue Dinin made his way carefully through the dark avenues of Menzoberranzan, the city of drow. A renegade, with no family to call his own for nearly twenty years, the seasoned fighter knew well the perils of the city, and knew how to avoid them. He passed an abandoned compound along the two mile-long cavern\u0027s western wall and could not help but pause and stare. Twin stalagmite mounds supported a blasted fence around the whole of the place, and two sets of broken doors, one on the ground and one beyond a balcony twenty feet up the wall, hung open awkwardly on twisted and scorched hinges. How many times had Dinin levitated up to that balcony, entering the private quarters of the nobles of his house, House Do\u0027Urden? House Do\u0027Urden. It was forbidden even to speak the name in the drow city. Once, Dinin\u0027s family had been the eighth-ranked among the sixty or so drow families in Menzoberranzan; his mother had sat on the ruling council; and he, Dinin, had been a Master at Melee-Magthere, the School of Fighters, at the famed drow Academy. Standing before the compound, it seemed to Dinin as if the place were a thousand years removed from that time of glory. His family was no more, his house lay in ruins, and Dinin had been forced to take up with Bregan D\u0027aerthe, an infamous mercenary band, simply to survive. \"Once,\" the rogue drow mouthed quietly. He shook his slender shoulders and pulled his concealing piwafwi cloak around him, remembering how vulnerable a houseless drow could be. A quick glance toward the center of the cavern, toward the pillar that was Narbondel, showed him that the hour was late. At the break of each day, the Arch-mage of Menzoberranzan went out to Narbondel and infused the pillar with a magical, lingering heat that would work its way up, then back down. To sensitive drow eyes, which could look into the infrared spectrum, the level of heat in the pillar acted as a gigantic glowing clock. Now Narbondel was almost cool; another day neared its end. Dinin had to go more than halfway across the city, to a secret cave within the Clawrift, a great chasm running out from Menzoberranzan\u0027s northwestern wall. There Jarlaxle, the leader of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, waited in one of his many hideouts. The drow fighter cut across the center of the city, passed right by Narbondel, and beside more than a hundred hollowed stalagmites, comprising a dozen separate family compounds, their fabulous sculptures and gargoyles glowing in multicolored faerie fire. Drow soldiers, walking posts along house walls or along the bridges connecting multitudes of leering stalactites, paused and regarded the lone stranger carefully, hand crossbows or poisoned javelins held ready until Dinin was far beyond them. That was the way in Menzoberranzan: always alert, always distrustful. Dinin gave one careful look around when he reached the edge of the Clawrift, then slipped over the side and used his innate powers of levitation to slowly descend into the chasm. More than a hundred feet down, he again looked into the bolts of readied hand crossbows, but these were withdrawn as soon as the mercenary guardsmen recognized Dinin as one of their own. Jarlaxle has been waiting for you, one of the guards signaled in the intricate silent hand code of the dark elves. Dinin didn\u0027t bother to respond. He owed commoner soldiers no explanations. He pushed past the guardsmen rudely, making his way down a short tunnel that soon branched into a virtual maze of corridors and rooms. Several turns later, the dark elf stopped before a shimmering door, thin and almost translucent. He put his hand against its surface, letting his body heat make an impression that heat-sensing eyes on the other side would understand as a knock. \"At last,\" he heard a moment later, in Jarlaxle\u0027s voice. \"Do come in, Dinin, my Khal\u0027abbil. You have kept me waiting far too long.\" Dinin paused a moment to get a bearing on the unpredictable mercenary\u0027s inflections and words. Jarlaxle had called him Khal\u0027abbil, \"my trusted friend,\" his nickname for Dinin since the raid that had destroyed House Do\u0027Urden (a raid in which Jarlaxle had played a prominent role), and there was no obvious sarcasm in the mercenary\u0027s tone. There seemed to be nothing wrong at all. But, why, then, had Jarlaxle recalled him from his critical scouting mission to House Vandree, the Seventeenth House of Menzoberranzan? Dinin wondered. It had taken Dinin nearly a year to gain the trust of the imperiled Vandree house guard, a position, no doubt, that would be severely jeopardized by his unexplained absence from the house compound. There was only one way to find out, the rogue soldier decided. He held his breath and forced his way into the opaque barrier. It seemed as if he were passing through a wall of thick water, though he did not get wet, and, after several long steps across the flowing extraplanar border of two planes of existence, he forced his way through the seemingly inch-thick magical door and entered Jarlaxle\u0027s small room. The room was alight in a comfortable red glow, allowing Dinin to shift his eyes from the infrared to the normal light spectrum. He blinked as the transformation completed, then blinked again, as always, when he looked at Jarlaxle. The mercenary leader sat behind a stone desk in an exotic cushioned chair, supported by a single stem with a swivel so that it could rock back at a considerable angle. Comfortably perched, as always, Jarlaxle had the chair leaning way back, his slender hands clasped behind his clean-shaven head (so unusual for a drow!). Just for amusement, it seemed, Jarlaxle lifted one foot onto the table, his high black boot hitting the stone with a resounding thump, then lifted the other, striking the stone just as hard, but this boot making not a whisper. The mercenary wore his ruby-red eye patch over his right eye this day, Dinin noted. To the side of the desk stood a trembling little humanoid creature, barely half Dinin\u0027s five-and-a-half-foot height, including the small white horns protruding from the top of its sloping brow. \"One of House Oblodra\u0027s kobolds,\" Jarlaxle explained casually. \"It seems the pitiful thing found its way in, but cannot so easily find its way back out.\" The reasoning seemed sound to Dinin. House Oblodra, the Third House of Menzoberranzan, occupied a tight compound at the end of the Clawrift and was rumored to keep thousands of kobolds for torturous pleasure, or to serve as house fodder in the event of a war. \"Do you wish to leave?\" Jarlaxle asked the creature in a guttural, simplistic language. The kobold nodded eagerly, stupidly. Jarlaxle indicated the opaque door, and the creature darted for it. It had not the strength to penetrate the barrier, though, and it bounced back, nearly landing on Dinin\u0027s feet. Before it even bothered to get up, the kobold foolishly sneered in contempt at the mercenary leader. Jarlaxle\u0027s hand flicked several times, too quickly for Dinin to count. The drow fighter reflexively tensed, but knew better than to move, knew that Jarlaxle\u0027s aim was always perfect. When he looked down at the kobold, he saw five daggers sticking from its lifeless body, a perfect star formation on the scaly creature\u0027s little chest. Jarlaxle only shrugged at Dinin\u0027s confused stare. \"I could not allow the beast to return to Oblodra,\" he reasoned, \"not after it learned of our compound so near theirs.\" Dinin shared Jarlaxle\u0027s laugh. He started to retrieve the daggers, but Jarlaxle reminded him that there was no need. \"They will return of their own accord,\" the mercenary explained, pulling at the edge of his bloused sleeve to reveal the magical sheath enveloping his wrist. \"Do sit,\" he bade his friend, indicating an unremarkable stool at the side of the desk. \"We have much to discuss.\" \"Why did you recall me?\" Dinin asked bluntly as he took his place beside the desk. \"I had infiltrated Vandree fully.\" \"Ah, my Khal\u0027abbil,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"Always to the point. That is a quality I do so admire in you.\" \"Uln\u0027hyrr,\" Dinin retorted, the drow word for \"liar.\" Vierna. Malice, Vierna\u0027s mother and Matron of House Do\u0027Urden, had ultimately been undone by her failure to recapture and kill the traitorous Drizzt. Vierna did calm down, then she began a fit of mocking laughter that went on for many minutes. \"You see why I summoned you?\" Jarlaxle remarked to Dinin, taking no heed of the priestess. \"You wish me to kill her before she can become a problem?\" Dinin replied equally casually. Vierna\u0027s laughter halted; her wild-eyed gaze fell over her impertinent brother. \"Wishyal\" she cried, and a wave of magical energy hurled Dinin from his seat, sent him crashing into the stone wall. \"Kneel!\" Vierna commanded, and Dinin, when he regained his composure, fell to his knees, all the while looking blankly at Jarlaxle. The mercenary, too, could not hide his surprise. This last command was a simple spell, certainly not one that should have worked so easily on a seasoned fighter of Dinin\u0027s stature. \"I am in Lloth\u0027s favor,\" Vierna, standing tall and straight, explained to both of them. \"If you oppose me, then you are not, and with the power of Lloth\u0027s blessings for my spells and curses against you, you will find no defense.\" \"The last we heard of Drizzt placed him on the surface,\" Jarlaxle said to Vierna, to deflect her rising anger. \"By all reports, he remains there still.\" Vierna nodded, grinning weirdly all the while, her pearly white teeth contrasting dramatically with her shining ebony skin. \"He does,\" she agreed, \"but Lloth has shown me the way to him, the way to glory.\" Again, Jarlaxle and Dinin exchanged confused glances. By all their estimates, Vierna\u0027s claims - and Vierna herself - sounded insane. But Dinin, against his will and against all measures of sanity, was still kneeling. Part 1 The Inspiring Fear Nearly three decades have passed since I left my home-Viand, a small measure of time by the reckoning of a I draw elf, but a period that seems a lifetime to me. All \\that I desired, or believed that I desired, when I walked out of Menzoberranzan\u0027s dark cavern, was a true home, a place of friendship and peace where I might hang my scimitars above the mantle of a warm hearth and share stories with trusted companions. I have found all that now, beside Bruenor in the hallowed halls of his youth. We prosper. We have peace. I wear my weapons only on my five-day journeys between Mithril Hall and Silvery-moon. Was I wrong? I do not doubt, nor do I ever lament, my decision to leave the vile world of Menzoberranzan, but I am beginning to believe now, in the (endless) quiet and peace, that my desires at that critical time were founded in the inevitable longing of inexperience. I had never known that calm existence I so badly wanted. I cannot deny that my life is better, a thousand times better, than anything I ever knew in the Underdark. And yet, I cannot remember the last time I felt the anxiety, the inspiring fear, of impending battle, the tingling that can come only when an enemy is near or a challenge must be met. Oh, I do remember the specific instance - just a year ago, when Wulfgar, Guenhwyvar, and I worked the lower tunnels in the cleansing of Mithril Hall - but that feeling, that tingle of fear, has long since faded from memory. Are we then creatures of action? Do we say that we desire those accepted cliches of comfort when, in fact, it is the challenge and the adventure that truly give us life? I must admit, to myself at least, that I do not know. There is one point that I cannot dispute, though, one truth that will inevitably help me resolve these questions and which places me in a fortunate position, for now, beside Bruenor and his kin, beside Wulfgar and Catti-brie and Guenhwyvar, dear Guenhwyvar, my destiny is my own to choose. I am safer now than ever before in my sixty years of life. The prospects have never looked better for the future, for continued peace and continued security. And yet, I feel mortal. For the first time, I look to what has passed rather than to what is still to come. There is no other way to explain it. I feel that I am dying, that those stories I so desired to share with friends will soon grow stale, with nothing to replace them. But, I remind myself again, the choice is mine to make.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-1.html","bookId":2127,"book":{"id":2127,"title":"The Legacy (Legacy of the Drow #1)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #1: The Legacy A new mass market edition of the New York Times best-selling sword and sorcery classic, The Legacy is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best!
