{"id":94075,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Dust continued to settle in the wide chamber, dulling the flickering light; one of the torches had been extinguished beneath a falling chunk of I stone, its glow snuffed out in the blink of an eye. Snuffed out like the light in Wulfgar\u0027s eyes. When the rumbling finally stopped, when the larger pieces of collapsed ceiling settled, Catti-brie turned herself about and managed to sit up, facing the rubble-filled alcove. She wiped the dirt from her eyes, blinked through the gloom for several long moments before the grim truth of the scene registered fully.\n The monster\u0027s one visible tentacle, still wrapped about the young woman\u0027s ankle, had been cleanly severed, its back edge, near the rubble, twitching reflexively.\n Beyond it there was only piled rock. The enormity of the situation overwhelmed Catti-brie. She swayed to the side, nearly swooned, finding her strength only when a burst of anger and denial welled up within her. She tore her feet free of the tentacle and scrambled ahead on all fours. She tried to stand, but her head throbbed, keeping her low. Again came the wave of weak nausea, the invitation to fall back into unconsciousness.\n Wulfgar!\n Catti-brie crawled on, slapped aside the twitching tentacle, and began digging into the stone pile with her bare hands, scraping her skin and tearing a fingernail painfully. How similar this collapse seemed to the one that had taken Drizzt on the companions\u0027 first crossing of Mithril Hall. But that had been a dwarf-designed trap, a rigged fall that dropped out the floor as it had dropped out a ceiling block, sending Drizzt careening safely into a lower corridor.\n This was no rigged trap, Catti-brie reminded herself; there was no chute to a lower chamber. A soft groan, a whimper, escaped her lips and she clawed on, desperate to get Wulfgar from the crushing pile, praying that the rocks had collapsed in an angle that would allow the barbarian to survive.\n Then Bruenor was beside her, dropping his axe and shield to the floor and going at the pile with abandon. The powerful dwarf managed to move several large stones aside, but when the outer rim of the cave-in had been cleared, he stopped his work and stood staring blankly at the pile.\n Catti-brie kept digging, didn\u0027t notice her father\u0027s frown.\n After more than two centuries of mining, Bruenor understood the truth. The collapse was complete.\n The lad was gone.\n Catti-brie continued to dig, and to sniffle, as her mind began to tell her what her heart continued to deny.\n Bruenor put his hand on her arm to stop her from her pointless work, and when she looked up at him, her expression broke the tough dwarf\u0027s heart. Her face was grime-covered. Blood was caked on one cheek, and her hair was matted to her head. Bruenor then saw only Catti-brie\u0027s eyes, doelike orbs of deepest blue, glistening with moisture.\n Bruenor slowly shook his head.\n Catti-brie fell back to a sitting position, her bleeding hands limp in her lap, her eyes unblinking. How many times had she and her friends come so close to this final point? she wondered. How many times had they escaped Death\u0027s greedy clutches at the last instant?\n The odds had caught up to them, had caught up to Wulfgar, here and now, suddenly, without warning.\n Gone was the mighty fighter, leader of his tribe, the man Catti-brie had intended to marry. She, Bruenor, even mighty Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, could do nothing to help him, nothing to change what had happened.\n \"He saved me,\" the young woman whispered. Bruenor seemed not to hear her. The dwarf continually wiped at the dust in his eyes, at the dust that collected in the large teardrops that gathered and then slipped down, streaking his dirty cheeks. Wulfgar had been like a son to Bruenor. The tough dwarf had taken the young Wulfgar - just a boy back then - into his home after a battle, ostensibly as a slave but in truth to teach the lad a better way. Bruenor had molded Wulfgar into a man who could be trusted, a man of honest character. The happiest day in the dwarf\u0027s life, even happier than the day Bruenor had reclaimed Mithril Hall, was the day Wulfgar and Catti-brie had announced they would wed.\n Bruenor kicked a heavy stone, the force of his blow shifting it aside.\n There lay Aegis-fang.\n The brave dwarf\u0027s knees went weak at the sight of the marvelous warhammer\u0027s head, etched with the symbols of Dumathoin, a dwarven god, the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain. Bruenor forced deep breaths into his lungs and tried to steady himself for a long while before he could manage the strength to reach down and work the hammer free of the rubble.\n It had been Bruenor\u0027s greatest creation, the epitome of his considerable smithing abilities. He had put all of his love and skill into forging the hammer; he had made it for Wulfgar.\n Catti-brie\u0027s semistoic front collapsed like the ceiling at the sight of the weapon. Quiet sobs made her shoulders bob, and she trembled, seeming frail in the dim, dusty light.\n Bruenor found his own strength in watching her display. He reminded himself that he was the Eighth King of Mithril Hall, that he was responsible for his subjects - and for his daughter. He slipped the precious warhammer into the strap of his traveling pack and hooked an arm under Catti-brie\u0027s shoulder, hoisting her to her feet.\n \"We can\u0027t do a thing for the boy,\" Bruenor whispered. Catti-brie pulled away from him and moved back to the pile, growling as she tossed several smaller stones aside. She could see the futility of it all, could see the tons of dirt and stones, many of them too large to be moved, filling the alcove. But Catti-brie dug anyway, simply incapable of giving up on the barbarian. No other apparent course offered any hope.\n Bruenor\u0027s hands gently closed about her upper arms.\n With a snarl, the young woman shrugged him away and resumed her work.\n \"No!\" Bruenor roared, and he grabbed her again, forcefully, lifting her from the ground and hauling her back from the pile. He put her down hard, with his wide shoulders squared between her and the pile, and whichever way Catti-brie went to get around him, Bruenor shuffled to block her.\n \"Ye can\u0027t do a thing!\" he shouted into her face a dozen times.\n \"I\u0027ve got to try!\" she finally pleaded with him, when it became obvious to her that Bruenor was not going to let her back to the digging.\n Bruenor shook his head - only the tears in his dark eyes, his obvious distress, prevented Catti-brie from punching him in the face. She did calm down then, stopped trying to slip past the stubborn dwarf.\n \"It\u0027s over,\" Bruenor said to her. \"The boy ... me boy, choosed his course. He gave himself for us, yerself and me. Don\u0027t ye do him the dishonor of letting stupid pains keep ye here, in danger.\"\n Catti-brie\u0027s body seemed to slump at the undeniable truth of Bruenor\u0027s reasoning. She did not move back to the pile, to Wulfgar\u0027s burial cairn, as Bruenor retrieved his shield and axe. The dwarf came back to her and draped one arm about her back.\n \"Say yer good-byes,\" he offered, and he silently waited a moment before leading Catti-brie away, first to her bow, then from the chamber, toward the same entrance through which they had come.\n Catti-brie stopped beside him and regarded him and the tunnel curiously, as if questioning their course.\n \"Pwent and the cat\u0027ll have to find their own way about,\" Bruenor answered her blank stare, misunderstanding her confusion.\n Catti-brie wasn\u0027t worried about Guenhwyvar. She knew that nothing could bring the panther serious harm while she still possessed the magical figurine, and she wasn\u0027t worried about the missing battlerager at all.\n \"What about Drizzt?\" she asked simply.\n \"Me guess is that the elf\u0027s alive,\" Bruenor answered with confidence. \"One of them drow asked me about him, asked me where he was at. He\u0027s alive, and he\u0027s got away from them, and by me own figuring, Drizzt\u0027s got a better chance o\u0027 getting clear of these tunnels than the two of us. Might be that the cat\u0027s with him even now.\"\n \"And it might be that he needs us,\" Catti-brie argued, pulling free of Bruenor\u0027s gentle touch. She flipped the bow over her shoulder and crossed her arms over her chest, her face grim and determined.\n \"We\u0027re going home, girl,\" Bruenor ordered sternly. \"We\u0027re not for knowing where Drizzt might be. I\u0027m only guessing, and hoping, that he really is alive!\"\n \"Are ye willing to take the chance?\" Catti-brie asked simply. \"Are ye willing to risk that he\u0027s needing us? We lost one friend, maybe two if the assassin finished off Regis. I\u0027m not for giving up on Drizzt, not for any risk.\" She winced as another memory flashed through her mind, a memory of being lost on Tarterus, another plane of existence, when Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had bravely faced unspeakable horrors to bring her home.\n \"Ye remember Tarterus?\" she said to Bruenor, and the thought made the helpless-feeling dwarf blink and turn away.\n \"I\u0027m not giving up,\" Catti-brie said again, \"not for any risk.\" She looked to the tunnel entrance across the way, where the escaping dark elves apparently had taken flight. \"Not for any damned dark elves and their hell-spawned friends!\"\n Bruenor stayed quiet for a long while, thinking of Wulfgar, milling over his daughter\u0027s determined words. Drizzt might be about, might be hurt, might be caught again. If it was Bruenor lost down there, and Drizzt up here, the dwarf had no doubt which course Drizzt would choose.\n He looked again at Catti-brie and at the pile behind her. He had just lost Wulfgar. How could he risk losing Catti-brie as well?\n Bruenor looked more closely at Catti-brie, saw the seething determination in her eyes. \"That\u0027s me girl,\" the dwarf said quietly.\n They retrieved the remaining torch and left through the exit on the opposite side of the chamber, moved deeper into the tunnels in search of their missing friend.\n One who had not been raised in the perpetual gloom of the Underdark would not have noticed the subtle shift in the depth of the darkness, the slight tingling breeze of fresher air. To Drizzt the changes came as obviously as a slap across the face, and he picked up his pace, hoisting Regis tight to his side.\n \"What is it?\" the scared halfling demanded, glancing about as if he expected Artemis Entreri to jump out of the nearest shadows and devour him.\n They passed a wide but low side passage, sloping upward. Drizzt hesitated, his direction sense screaming to him that he had just passed the correct tunnel. He ignored those silent pleas, though, and continued on, hopeful that the opening to the outside world would be accessible enough for him and Regis to get a welcome breath of fresh air.\n It was. They rounded a bend in the tunnel and felt the chilly burst of wind in their faces, saw a lighter opening ahead, and saw beyond it towering mountains . . . and stars!\n The halfling\u0027s profound sigh of relief echoed Drizzt\u0027s sentiments perfectly as he carried Regis on. When they came out of the tunnel, both of them were nearly overcome by the splendor of the mountainous scene spread wide before them, by the sheer beauty of the surface world under the stars, so removed from the starless nights of the Underdark. The wind, rushing past them, seemed a vital and alive entity.\n They were on a narrow ledge, two-thirds of the way to the bottom of a steep, thousand-foot cliff. A narrow path wound up to their right, down to the left, but at only a slight angle, which offered little hope that it would continue long enough to get them either up or down the cliff.\n Drizzt considered the towering wall. He knew he could easily manage the few hundred feet to the bottom, could probably get up to the top without too much trouble, but he didn\u0027t think he\u0027d be able to bring Regis with him and didn\u0027t like the prospect of being in an unknown stretch of wilderness, not knowing how long it might take him to get back to Mithril Hall.\n His friends, not so far away, were in trouble.\n \"Keeper\u0027s Dale is up there,\" Regis remarked hopefully, pointing to the northwest, \"probably no more than a few miles.\"\n Drizzt nodded but replied, \"We have to go back in.\"\n While Regis did not seem pleased by that prospect, he did not argue, understanding that he could not get off this ledge in his present condition.\n \"Well done,\" came Entreri\u0027s voice from up around the bend. The assassin\u0027s dark silhouette came into sight, the jewels of his belted dagger glimmering like his heat-seeing eyes. \"I knew you would come to this place,\" he explained to Drizzt. \"I knew you would sense the clean air and make for it.\"\n \"Do you congratulate me or yourself?\" the drow ranger asked.\n \"Both!\" Entreri replied with a hearty laugh. The white of his teeth disappeared, replaced by a cold frown, as he continued to approach. \"The tunnel you passed fifty yards back will indeed take you to the higher level, where you\u0027ll likely find your friends - your dead friends, no doubt.\"\n Drizzt didn\u0027t take the bait, didn\u0027t let his rage send him charging ahead.\n \"But you cannot get there, can you?\" Entreri teased. \"You alone could keep ahead of me, could avoid the fight I demand. But, alas for your wounded companion. Think of it, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. Leave the halfling and you can run free!\"\n Drizzt didn\u0027t justify the absurd thought with a reply.\n \"I would leave him,\" Entreri remarked, dropping his cold glare over Regis as he spoke. The halfling gave a curious whimper and slumped under the strong hold of Drizzt\u0027s arm.\n Drizzt tried not to imagine the horrors Regis had suffered at Entreri\u0027s vile hands.\n \"You will not leave him,\" Entreri continued. \"We long ago established that difference between us, the difference you call strength, but that I know to be weakness.\" He was only a dozen strides away; his slender sword hissed free of its scabbard, illuminating him in its blue-green glow. \"And so to our business,\" he said. \"And so to our destiny. Do you like the battlefield I have prepared? The only way off this ledge is the tunnel behind you, and so I, like yourself, cannot flee, must play it out to the end.\" He looked over the cliff as he spoke. \"A deadly drop for the loser,\" he explained, smiling. \"A fight with no reprieve.\"\n Drizzt could not deny the sensations that came over him, the heat in his breast and behind his eyes. He could not deny that, in some repressed corner of his heart and soul, he wanted this challenge, wanted to prove Entreri wrong, to prove the assassin\u0027s existence to be worthless. Still, the fight would never have happened if Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had been given a reasonable choice. The desires of his ego, he understood and fully accepted, were no valid reason for mortal combat. Now, with Regis helpless behind him and his friends somewhere above, facing dark elf enemies, the challenge had to be met.\n He felt the hard metal of his scimitar hilts in his hands, let his eyes slip back fully into the normal spectrum of light as Twinkle flared its angry blue.\n Entreri halted, sword at one side, dagger at the other, and motioned for Drizzt to approach.\n For the third time in less than a day, Twinkle slapped hard against the assassin\u0027s slender blade; the third time, and, as far as both Drizzt and Entreri were concerned, the very last time.\n They started easily, each measuring his steps on the unorthodox arena. The ledge was perhaps ten feet wide at this point, but narrowed considerably just behind Drizzt and just behind Entreri.\n A backhand slash with the sword led Entreri\u0027s routine, dagger thrust following.\n Two solid parries sounded, and Drizzt snapped one scimitar for the opening between Entreri\u0027s blades, an opening that was closed by a retreating sword in the blink of an eye, with Drizzt\u0027s attack slapped harmlessly aside.\n They circled, Drizzt inside and near the wall, the assassin moving easily near the drop. Entreri slashed low, unexpectedly leading with the dagger this time.\n Drizzt hopped the shortened cut, came with a two-chop combination for the ducking assassin\u0027s head. Entreri\u0027s sword darted left and right, worked horizontally above his head to block ensuing blows, and shifted its angle slightly to poke ahead, to keep the drow at bay while the assassin came back to equal footing.\n \"It will not be a quick kill,\" Entreri promised with an evil smile. As if to disprove his own claim, he leaped ahead furiously, sword leading.\n Drizzt\u0027s hands worked in a blur, his scimitars hitting the deftly angled weapon repeatedly. The dark elf worked to the side, kept his back from flattening against the wall.\n Drizzt agreed fully with the assassin\u0027s estimate - this would not be a quick kill, whoever might win. They would fight for many minutes, for an hour, perhaps. And to what end? Drizzt wondered. What gain could he expect? Would Vierna and her cohorts show up and bring the challenge to a premature conclusion?\n How vulnerable Drizzt and Regis would be then, with nowhere to run and a drop of several hundred feet just inches away!\n Again the assassin pressed the attack, and again Drizzt worked his scimitars through the proper, perfectly balanced defenses, Entreri getting nowhere near to hitting him.\n Entreri went into a spin then, imitating Drizzt\u0027s movements in their previous two encounters, working his two blades like the edge of a screw to force Drizzt back to a narrower position on the ledge.\n Drizzt was surprised that the assassin had learned the daring and difficult maneuver so completely after only two observations, but it was a move Drizzt had designed, and he knew how to counter it.\n He, too, went into a spinning rotation, scimitars flowing, up and down. Blades connected repeatedly with each turn, sometimes lighting sparks in the dark night, metal screeching, green and blue mixing in an indistinct blur. Drizzt moved right by Entreri - the assassin reversed his spin suddenly, but Drizzt saw the shift and came to a stop, both blades blocking the reversed cut of sword and dagger.\n Drizzt began once more, counter to Entreri, and this time, when Entreri again turned his rotation back the other way, the drow anticipated it so fully that he actually reversed direction first.\n For Regis, staring helplessly, not daring to intervene, and for any of the region\u0027s nocturnal creatures that might have been watching, there were no words to describe the amazing dance, the interweaving of colors as Twinkle and the assassin\u0027s glowing blade passed, the violet sparkle of Drizzt\u0027s eyes, the red heat of Entreri\u0027s. The scrape of blades became a symphony, a myriad of notes playing to the dance, belviecv. these most bitter enemies.\n They stopped in unison, a few feet apart, both understanding that there would be no end to that spinning dance, no advantage by either player. They stood like matching bookends of identical weight.\n Entreri laughed aloud at the realization, laughed so that he might savor this moment, this many act play that perhaps would see the dawn, and perhaps would never be resolved.\n Drizzt found no humor, and his private eagerness at the beginning of the challenge had flown, leaving him with the weight of responsibility - for Regis and for his friends back in the tunnels.\n The assassin came in low and hard, sword darting, climbing with each strike as Entreri gradually straightened his stance, taking a full measure of Drizzt\u0027s defenses from a variety of cunning angles.\n Entreri settled him into a parrying rhythm, then broke the melody with a vicious dagger cut. The assassin howled in glee, thinking for a moment that his blade had slipped through.\n Twinkle\u0027s hilt had intercepted it cleanly, had caught it and held it, barely an inch from Drizzt\u0027s side. The assassin grimaced and stubbornly tried to push on as he came to understand the truth.\n Drizzt\u0027s expression was colder still; the dagger did not move.\n A twist of the drow\u0027s wrist sent both blades flying wide. Entreri was wise enough to push off and break the clench, to circle back and wait for the next opportunity to present itself.\n \"I almost had you,\" he teased. He hid his frown well as Drizzt in no way responded, not with words, not with body movements, not with the unyielding set of his ebony-skinned features.\n A scimitar snapped across, ringing loudly through the breeze as Entreri brought his blocking sword in its path.\n The sudden sound assaulted Drizzt, reminded him that Vierna might not be far away. He pictured his friends in dire trouble, captured or dead, felt a special twinge of remorse for Wulfgar that he could not explain. He locked stares with Entreri, reminded himself that this man had been the one to cause it all, that this enemy had tricked him into the tunnels, had separated him from his friends.\n And now Drizzt could not protect them.\n A scimitar snapped across; the other came slashing in the other way. Drizzt repeated the routine, then a third time, each movement, each ring of metal against metal, bringing his thoughts more in line with this task, lifting his emotional preparations, heightening his warrior senses.\n Each strike was perfectly aimed, and each parry intercepted the attacking blades perfectly, yet neither Drizzt nor Entreri, locked through their staring eyes into mental combat, watched their hands through the physical movements. Neither one blinked, not when the breeze of Drizzt\u0027s high slice moved the hair atop the assassin\u0027s head, not when Entreri\u0027s sword thrust came to a parried stop a hairsbreadth from Drizzt\u0027s eye.\n Drizzt felt his momentum building, felt the give and take of the battle corning quicker, strike and parry. Entreri, as consumed as the ranger, paced him.\n The movements of their bodies began to catch the blur of hands and weapons. Entreri dipped a shoulder, sword lashing out straight ahead; Drizzt spun a complete circle, parrying behind his back as he flitted out of reach.\n Images of Bruenor and Catti-brie captured by Vierna tormented the ranger; he pictured Wulfgar, wounded or dying, a drow sword at his throat. He imagined the barbarian atop a funeral pyre, a conjured image that, for some reason Drizzt could not understand, would not be easily dismissed. Drizzt accepted the images, gave the mental assault his full attention, let the fears for his friends fuel his passion. That had been the difference between him and the assassin, he told himself, told that part of himself that argued for him to keep his mind clear and his movements precise and well considered.\n That was how Entreri played the game, always in control, never feeling anything beyond the enemy at hand.\n A slight growl escaped Drizzt\u0027s lips; his lavender eyes simmered in the starlight. In his mind Catti-brie screamed out in pain.\n He came at Entreri in a wild rush.\n The assassin laughed at him, sword and dagger working furiously to keep the two scimitars at bay. \"Give in to the rage,\" he chided. \"Let go of your discipline!\"\n Entreri didn\u0027t understand; that was precisely the point.\n Twinkle chopped in, to be predictably parried by Entreri\u0027s sword. It wouldn\u0027t be that easy for the assassin this time, though. Drizzt retracted and struck again, and again, repeatedly, willingly slamming his blade against the assassin\u0027s already poised weapon. His other blade came in furiously from the other side; Entreri\u0027s dagger turned it aside.\n Drizzt\u0027s ensuing flurry, sheer madness, it seemed, kept the assassin back on his heels. A dozen hits, two dozen, sounded like one long cry of ringing steel.\n Entreri\u0027s expression betrayed his laughter. He had not expected this wild an offensive routine, had not expected Drizzt to be so daring. If he could get one of his blades free for just an instant, the drow would be vulnerable.\n But Entreri could not free up sword or dagger. Fires drove Drizzt on, kept his pace impossibly fast and his concentration perfect. To the Nine Hells with his own life, he decided, for his friends needed him to prevail.\n On and on the offensive routine continued; Regis covered his ears at the horrid wail and screech of the blades, but the halfling could not, for all his terror, take his gaze from the fighting masters. How many times Regis expected one or both to pitch over the cliff! How many times he thought a sword or scimitar thrust had struck home! But they somehow kept on fighting, each attack just missing, each defense in line at the last possible instant.\n Twinkle hit the sword; Drizzt\u0027s following strike from the other side was not parried but went in short as Entreri shifted his foot and fell back a step.\n The assassin\u0027s dagger arm shot forward. Entreri released a primal scream of victory, thinking Drizzt had slipped up.\n Twinkle came across from its high perch faster than Entreri expected, faster than the assassin believed possible, gashing his forearm an instant before he got the dagger to Drizzt\u0027s exposed belly. Back flew the scimitar, backhanding the sword away. Entreri leaped ahead to get in close, realizing his vulnerability.\n His sudden charge saved his life, but while Drizzt could not angle the tip of his free blade for a killing thrust, he could, and did, punch out with the hilt, connecting solidly with Entreri\u0027s face, sending the man staggering backward.\n On came the dark elf, blades flashing relentlessly, driving Entreri back to within an inch of the cliff. The assassin tried to go to his right, but one scimitar knocked aside his blocking sword while the other\u0027s maneuvering kept Drizzt directly in front of him. The assassin started left, but with his wounded dagger arm slow to react, he knew he could not get beyond the drow\u0027s reach in time. Entreri held his ground, parrying furiously, trying to find a countering routine that would drive this possessed enemy back.\n Drizzt\u0027s breath came in short puffs as he found a rhythm to his frantic pace. His eyes flared, unrelenting, as he reminded himself over and over that his friends were dying - and that he could not protect them!\n He fell too far into the rage, hardly registered the movement as the dagger flew at him. At the very last instant, he ducked aside, the skin above his cheekbone slashed in a three-inch-long cut. More importantly, Drizzt\u0027s forward rhythm was shattered. His arms ached from the exertion; his momentum had played itself out.\n On came the snarling assassin, sword poking, even scoring a slight hit, as he drove Drizzt back and around. By the time the ranger had regained his balance somewhat, his toes, not Entreri\u0027s, were squarely facing the mountain wall, his heels feeling the free-flowing emptiness of the mountain winds.\n \"I am the better!\" Entreri proclaimed, and his ensuing attack almost proved his claim. Sword slashing and darting, he drove Drizzt\u0027s heel over the edge.\n Drizzt dropped to one knee to keep his weight forward. He felt the wind keenly, heard Regis scream his name. - Entreri could have leaped back and retrieved his dagger, but he sensed the kill, sensed he would never again have a better opportunity to end the game. His sword banged down with fury; Drizzt seemed to buckle under its weight, seemed to slip even farther over the cliff edge.\n Drizzt reached to his inner self, to the innate magic of his heritage ... and produced darkness.\n Drizzt dove to the side in a roll, came up several feet along the ledge, beyond the darkness globe he had created near Regis.\n Incredibly, Entreri was still in front of him, pressing him wickedly.\n \"I know your tricks, drow,\" the skilled assassin declared.\n A part of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden wanted to give in then, to simply lie back and let the mountains take him, but it was a fleeting moment of weakness, one from which Drizzt recoiled, one that fueled his indomitable spirit and lent strength to his weary arms.\n But so, too, was hungry Entreri fueled.\n Drizzt slipped suddenly and had to grab for the ledge, releasing his grip on his blade. Twinkle toppled over the cliff, skipping down along the stones.\n Entreri\u0027s sword slammed down, blocked by only the remaining scimitar. The assassin howled and jumped back, coming right back with a thrust.\n Drizzt could not stop it, Entreri knew, his eyes going wide as the moment of victory finally presented itself. The twisted draw\u0027s angle was all wrong; Drizzt couldn\u0027t possibly get his remaining blade down and turned in line in time.\n He couldn\u0027t stop it!\n Drizzt didn\u0027t try to stop it. He had quietly coiled one leg under him for a roll, and he went to the side and ahead as the sword dove in, narrowly missing. Drizzt spun his prone body about, one fool kicking against the front of Entreri\u0027s ankle, the other hooking and slamming the assassin behind the knee.\n Only then did Entreri realize that the drow\u0027s slip, and the lost scimitar, had been a ruse. Only then did Artemis Entreri realize that his own hunger for the kill had defeated him.\n His momentum forward with the eager thrust, he pitched toward the ledge. Every muscle in his body snapped taut; he drove his slender sword through Drizzt\u0027s foot and somehow managed to catch a hold on the drow\u0027s impaled boot with his free hand.\n The momentum was too great for Drizzt, still sidelong on the smooth ledge, to hold them both back. The drew was pulled out straight as he went over, right above Entreri, skidding down the stone, the agony in his foot fading as more pains, bruises and cuts from the jagged ride became evident.\n Drizzt held tightly to his second scimitar, jammed its hilt into a nook, and found a grasp with his other hand.\n He shuddered to a stop, and Entreri stretched out below him, over an inverted section that offered the assassin no chance of a handhold. Drizzt thought his entire insides would be ripped out through his impaled foot. He glanced down to see one of Entreri\u0027s hands waving wildly; the other clutched desperately to the sword hilt, a macabre and tentative lifeline.\n Drizzt groaned and grimaced, nearly fainted from the pain, as the blade slipped out several inches.\n \"No!\" he heard Entreri deny, and the assassin went very still, apparently understanding the precarious ness of his position.\n Drizzt looked down at him, hanging in midair, still well over two hundred feet from the ground.\n \"This is not the way to claim victory!\" Entreri called to him in a desperate burst. \u0027This defeats the purpose of the challenge and dishonors you.\"\n Drizzt reminded himself of Catti-brie, got the strange sensation once more that Wulfgar was lost to him.\n \"You did not win!\" Entreri cried.\n Drizzt let the fires in his lavender eyes speak for him. He set his hands and squared his jaw and turned his foot, feeling every deliciously agonizing inch as the long sword slipped through.\n Entreri scrambled and kicked, almost got a hold on Drizzt with his free hand, as the blade came free.\n The assassin rumbled away into the blackness of night, his cry swallowed by the mourn of the mountain wind.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-21.html","bookId":2127,"book":{"id":2127,"title":"The Legacy (Legacy of the Drow #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Legacy of the Drow #1: The Legacy \n A new mass market edition of the New York Times best-selling sword and sorcery classic, The Legacy is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best!
