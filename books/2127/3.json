{"id":94057,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The River Surbrin flowing in a valley far below him, Drizzt entered the eastern gate of Mithril Hall early that same afternoon. Catti-brie had skipped in some time before him to await the \"surprise\" of his return. The dwarven guards welcomed the drow ranger as though he were one of their bearded kin. Drizzt could not deny the warmth that flowed through him at their open welcome, though it was not unexpected since Bruenor\u0027s people had accepted him as a friend since their days in Icewind Dale. Drizzt needed no escort in the winding corridors of Mithril Hall, and he wanted none, preferring to be alone with the many emotions and memories that always came over him when he crossed this section of the upper complex. He moved across the new bridge at Garumn\u0027s Gorge. It was a structure of beautiful, arching stone that spanned hundreds of feet across the deep chasm. In this place Drizzt had lost Bruenor forever, or so he had thought, for he had seen the dwarf spiral down into the lightless depths on the back of a flaming dragon. He couldn\u0027t avoid a smile as the memory flowed to completion; it would take more than a dragon to kill mighty Bruenor Battlehammer! As he neared the end of the long expanse, Drizzt noticed that new guard towers, begun only ten days before, were nearly completed, the industrious dwarves having gone at their work with absolute devotion. Still, every one of the busy dwarven workers looked up to regard the drow\u0027s passing and give Drizzt a word of greeting. Drizzt headed for the main corridors leading out of the immense chamber south of the bridge, the sound of even more hammers leading the way. Just beyond the chamber, past a small anteroom, he came into a wide, high corridor, practically another chamber in itself, where the best craftsmen of Mithril Hall were hard at work, carving into the stone wall the likeness of Bruenor Battlehammer, in its appropriate place beside sculptures of Bruenor\u0027s royal ancestors, the seven predecessors of his throne. \"Fine work, eh, drow?\" came a call. Drizzt turned to regard a short, round dwarf with a short-clipped yellow beard barely reaching the top of his wide chest. \"Well met, Cobble,\" Drizzt greeted the speaker. Bruenor recently had appointed the dwarf Holy Cleric of the Halls, a valued position indeed. \"Fitting?\" Cobble asked as he indicated the twenty-foot-high sculpture of Mithril Hall\u0027s present king. \"For Bruenor, it should be a hundred feet tall,\" Drizzt replied, and the good-hearted Cobble shook with laughter. The continuing roar of it echoed behind Drizzt for many steps as he again headed down the winding corridors. He soon came to the upper level\u0027s hall area, the city above the wondrous Undercity. Catti-brie and Wulfgar roomed in this area, as did Bruenor most of the time, as he prepared for the spring trading season. Most of the other twenty-five hundred dwarves of the clan were far below, in the mines and in the Undercity, but those in this region were the commanders of the house guard and the elite soldiers. Even Drizzt, so welcomed in Bruenor\u0027s home, could not go to the king unannounced and unescorted. A square-shouldered rock of a dwarf with a sour demeanor and a long brown beard that he wore tucked into a wide, jeweled belt, led Drizzt down the final corridor to Bruenor\u0027s upper-level audience hall. General Dagna, as he was called, had been a personal attendant of King Harbromme of Citadel Adbar, the mightiest dwarven stronghold in the northland, but the gruff dwarf had come in at the head of Citadel Adbar\u0027s forces to help Bruenor reclaim his ancient homeland. With the war won, most of the Adbar dwarves had departed, but Dagna and two thousand others had remained after the cleansing of Mithril Hall, swearing fealty to clan Battlehammer and giving Bruenor a solid force with which to defend the riches of the dwarven stronghold. Dagna had stayed on with Bruenor to serve as his adviser and military commander. He professed no love for Drizzt, but certainly would not be foolish enough to insult the drow by allowing a lesser attendant to escort Drizzt to see the dwarf king. \"I told ye he\u0027d be back,\" Drizzt heard Bruenor grumbling from beyond the open doorway as they approached the audience hall. \"Th\u0027 elf\u0027d not be missing such a thing as yer wedding!\" \"I see they are expecting me,\" Drizzt remarked to Dagna. \"We heared ye was about from the folks o\u0027 Settlestone,\" the gruff general replied, not looking back to Drizzt as he spoke. \"Figerred ye\u0027d come in any day.\" Drizzt knew that the general - a dwarf among dwarves, as the others said - had little use for him, or for anyone, Wulfgar and Catti-brie included, who was not a dwarf. The dark elf smiled, though, for he was used to such prejudice and knew that Dagna was an important ally for Bruenor. \"Greetings,\" Drizzt said to his three friends as he entered the room. Bruenor sat on his stone throne, Wulfgar and Catti-brie flanking him. \"So ye made it,\" Catti-brie said absently, feigning disinterest. Drizzt smirked at their running secret; apparently Catti-brie hadn\u0027t told anyone that she had met him just outside the eastern door. \"We had not planned for this,\" added Wulfgar, a giant of a man with huge, corded muscles, long, flowing blond locks, and eyes the crystal blue of the northland\u0027s sky. \"I pray that there may be an extra seat at the table.\" Drizzt smiled and bowed low in apology. He deserved their chiding, he knew. He had been away a great deal lately, for weeks at a time. \"Bah!\" snorted the red-bearded Bruenor. \"I told ye he\u0027d come back, and back to stay this time!\" Drizzt shook his head, knowing he soon would go out again, searching for ... something. \"Ye hunting for the assassin, elf?\" he heard Bruenor ask. Never, Drizzt thought immediately. The dwarf referred to Artemis Entreri, Drizzt\u0027s most hated enemy, a heartless killer as skilled with the blade as the drow ranger, and determined - obsessed! - to defeat Drizzt. Entreri and Drizzt had battled in Calimport, a city far to the south, with Drizzt luckily winning the upper hand before events drove them apart. Emotionally Drizzt had brought the unfinished battle to its conclusion and had freed himself from a similar obsession against Entreri. Drizzt had seen himself in the assassin, had seen what he might have become had he stayed in Menzoberranzan. He could not stand the image, hungered only to destroy it. Catti-brie, dear and complicated Catti-brie, had taught Drizzt the truth, about Entreri and about himself. If he never saw Entreri again, Drizzt would be a happier person indeed. \"I\u0027ve no desire to meet that one again,\" Drizzt answered. He looked to Catti-brie, who sat impassively. She shot Drizzt a sly wink to show that she understood and approved. \"There are many sights in the wide world, dear dwarf,\" Drizzt went on, \"that cannot be seen from the shadows, many sounds more pleasant than the ring of steel, and many smells preferable to the stench of death.\" \"Cook another feast!\" Bruenor snorted, hopping up from his stone seat. \"Suren the elf has his eyes fixed on j another wedding!\" Drizzt let the remark pass without reply. Another dwarf rushed into the room, then exited, I pulling Dagna out behind him. A moment later, the flustered general returned. \"What is it?\" Bruenor grumbled. \"Another guest,\" Dagna explained and, even as he i spoke, a halfling, round in the belly, bopped into the room. \"Regis!\" cried a surprised Catti-brie, and she and Wulfgar rushed over to greet their friend. Unexpectedly, the five companions were together again. \"Rumblebelly!\" Bruenor shouted his customary nick-i name for the always hungry halfling. \"What in the Nine Hells - \" What indeed, Drizzt thought, curious that he had not spotted the traveler on the trails outside Mithril Hall. The friends had left Regis behind in Calimport, more than a thousand miles away, at the head of the thieves guild the i companions had all but decapitated in rescuing the halfling. \"Did you believe I would miss this occasion?\" Regis huffed, acting insulted that Bruenor even doubted him. \"The wedding of two of my dearest friends?\" Catti-brie threw a hug on him, which he seemed to enjoy immensely. Bruenor looked curiously at Drizzt and shook his head when he realized that the drow had no answers for this surprise. \"How\u0027d ye know?\" the dwarf asked the halfling. \"You underestimate your fame, King Bruenor,\" Regis replied, gracefully dipping into a bow that sent his belly dropping over his thin belt. The bow made him jingle as well, Drizzt noted. When Regis dipped, a hundred jewels and a dozen fat pouches tinkled. Regis had always loved fine things, but Drizzt had never seen the halfling so garishly bedecked. He wore a gem-studded jacket and more jewelry than Drizzt had ever seen in one place, including the magical, hypnotic ruby pendant. \"Might ye be staying long?\" Catti-brie asked. \"I am in no hurry,\" Regis replied. \"Might I have a room,\" he asked Bruenor, \"to put my things and rest away the weariness of a long road?\" \"We\u0027ll see to it,\" Catti-brie assured him as Drizzt and Bruenor exchanged glances once more. They both were thinking the same thing: that it was unusual for a master of a back-stabbing, opportunistic thieves\u0027 guild to leave his place of power for any length of time. \"And for yer attendants?\" Bruenor asked, a loaded question. \"Oh,\" stammered the halfling. \"I... came alone. The Southerners do not take well to the chill of a northern spring, you know.\" \"Well, off with ye, then,\" commanded Bruenor. \"Suren it be me turn to set out a feast for the pleasure of yer belly.\" Drizzt took a seat beside the dwarf king as the other three scooted out of the room. \"Few folk in Calimport have ever heared o\u0027 me name, elf,\" Bruenor remarked when he and Drizzt were alone. \"And who south o\u0027 Longsaddle would be knowing of the wedding?\" Bruenor\u0027s sly expression showed that the experienced dwarf agreed exactly with Drizzt\u0027s feeling. \"Suren the little one brings a bit of his treasure along with him, eh?\" the dwarf king asked. \"He is running,\" Drizzt replied. \"Got himself into trouble again - \" Bruenor snorted \" - or I\u0027m a bearded gnome!\" \"Five meals a day,\" Bruenor muttered to Drizzt after the drow and the halfling had been in Mithril Hall for a week. \"And helpings bigger than a half-sized one should hold!\" Drizzt, always amazed by Regis\u0027s appetite, had no answer for the dwarf king. Together they watched Regis from across the hall, stuffing bite after bite into his greedy mouth. \"Good thing we\u0027re opening new tunnels,\" Bruenor grumbled. \"I\u0027ll be needing a fair supply o\u0027 mithril to keep that one fed.\" As if Bruenor\u0027s reference to the new explorations had been a cue, General Dagna entered the dining hall. Apparently not interested in eating, the gruff, brown-bearded dwarf waved away an attendant and headed straight across the hall, toward Drizzt and Bruenor. \"That was a short trip,\" Bruenor remarked to Drizzt when they noticed the dwarf. Dagna had gone out just that morning, leading the latest scouting group to the new explorations in the deepest mines far to the west of the Undercity. \"Trouble or treasure?\" Drizzt asked rhetorically, and Bruenor only shrugged, always expecting - and secretly hoping for - both. \"Me king,\" Dagna greeted, coming in front of Bruenor and pointedly not looking at the dark elf. He dipped in a i curt bow, his rock-set expression giving no clues about which of Drizzt\u0027s suppositions might be accurate. \"Mithril?\" Bruenor asked hopefully. Dagna seemed surprised by the blunt question. \"Yes,\" he said at length. \"The tunnel beyond the sealed door j intercepted a whole new complex, rich in ore, from what we can tell. The legend of yer gem-sniffing nose\u0027ll continue to grow, me king.\" He dipped into another bow, this one \u0027. even lower than the first. \"Knew it,\" Bruenor whispered to Drizzt. \"Went down that way once, afore me beard even came out. Killed me and \u0027ettin...\" \"But we have trouble,\" Dagna interrupted, his face still expressionless. Bruenor waited, and waited some more, for the tiresome dwarf to explain. \"Trouble?\" he finally asked, realizing that Dagna had paused for dramatic effect, and that the stubborn general probably would stand quietly for the remainder of the day if Bruenor didn\u0027t offer that prompt. \"Goblins,\" Dagna said ominously. Bruenor snorted. \"Thought ye said we had trouble?\" \"A fair-sized tribe,\" Dagna went on. \"Could be hundreds.\" Bruenor looked up to Drizzt and recognized from the sparkle in the drow\u0027s lavender eyes that the news had not disturbed his friend any more than it had disturbed him. \"Hundreds of goblins, elf,\" Bruenor said slyly. \"What do ye think o\u0027 that?\" Drizzt didn\u0027t reply, just continued to smirk and let the gleam in his eye speak for itself. Times had become uneventful since the retaking of Mithril Hall; the only metal ringing in the dwarven tunnels was the miner\u0027s pick and shovel and the craftsman\u0027s sledge, and the trails between Mithril Hall and Silverymoon were rarely dangerous or adventurous to the skilled Drizzt. This news held particular interest for the drow. Drizzt was a ranger, dedicated to defending the good races, and he despised spindly-armed, foul-smelling goblins above all the other evil races in the world. Bruenor led the two over to Regis\u0027s table, though every other table in the large hall was empty. \"Supper\u0027s done,\" the red-bearded dwarf king huffed, sweeping the plates from in front of the halfling to land, crashing, on the floor. \"Go and get Wulfgar,\" Bruenor growled into the halfling\u0027s dubious expression. \"Ye got a count of fifty to get back to me. Longer than that, and I put ye on half rations!\" Regis was through the door in an instant. On Bruenor\u0027s nod, Dagna pulled a hunk of coal from his pocket and sketched a rough map of the new region on the table, showing Bruenor where they had encountered the goblin sign, and where further scouting had indicated the main lair to be. Of particular interest to the two dwarves were the worked tunnels in the region, with their even floors and squared walls. \"Good for surprising stupid goblins,\" Bruenor explained to Drizzt with a wink. \"You knew the goblins were there,\" Drizzt accused him, realizing that Bruenor was more thrilled, and less surprised, by the news of potential enemies than of potential riches. \"Figured there might be goblins,\" Bruenor admitted. \"Seen \u0027em down there once, but with the coming of the dragon, me father and his soldiers never got the time to clean the vermin out. Still, it was a long, long time ago, elf\" - the dwarf stroked his long red beard to accentuate the point - \"and I couldn\u0027t be sure they\u0027d still be there.\" \"We are threatened?\" came a resonant baritone voice behind them. The seven-foot-tall barbarian moved to the table and leaned low to take in Dagna\u0027s diagram. \"Just goblins,\" Bruenor replied. \"A call to war!\" Wulfgar roared, slapping Aegis-fang, the mighty warhammer Bruenor had forged for him, across his open palm. \"A call to play,\" Bruenor corrected, and he exchanged a nod and chuckle with Drizzt. \"By me own eyes, don\u0027t ye two seem eager to be killing,\" Catti-brie, standing behind with Regis, put in. \"Bet on it,\" Bruenor retorted. \"Ye found some goblins in their own hole, not to bothering anybody, and ye\u0027re planning for their slaughter,\" Catti-brie went on in the face of her father\u0027s sarcasm. \"Woman!\" Wulfgar shouted. Drizzt\u0027s amused smile evaporated in the blink of an eye, replaced by an expression of amazement as he regarded the towering barbarian\u0027s scornful mien. \"Be glad for that,\" Catti-brie answered lightly, without hesitation and without becoming distracted from the more important debate with Bruenor. \"How do ye know the goblins want a fight?\" she asked the king. \"Or do ye care?\" \"There\u0027s mithril in those tunnels,\" Bruenor replied, as if that would end the debate. \"Would that make it the goblins\u0027 mithril?\" Catti-brie asked innocently. \"Rightfully?\" \"Not for long,\" Dagna interjected, but Bruenor had no witty remarks to add, taken aback by his daughter\u0027s surprising line of somewhat incriminating questions. \"The fight\u0027s more important to ye, to all of ye,\" Catti-brie went on, turning her knowing blue eyes to regard all four of the group, \"than any treasures to be found. Ye hunger for the excitement. Ye\u0027d go after the goblins if the tunnels were no more than bare and worthless stone!\" \"Not me,\" Regis piped in, but nobody paid much attention. \"They are goblins,\" Drizzt said to her. \"Was it not a goblin raid that took your father\u0027s life?\" \"Aye,\" Catti-brie agreed. \"And if ever I find that tribe, then be knowing that they\u0027ll fall in piles for their wicked deed. But are they akin to this tribe, a thousand miles and more away?\" \"Goblins is goblins!\" Bruenor growled. \"Oh?\" Catti-brie replied, crossing her arms before her. \"And are drow?\" \"What talk is this?\" Wulfgar demanded as he glowered at his soon-to-be bride. \"If ye found a dark elf wandering yer tunnels,\" Catti-brie said to Bruenor, ignoring Wulfgar altogether - -even when he stormed over to stand right beside her - \"would ye draw up yer plans and cut the creature down?\" Bruenor gave an uncomfortable glance Drizzt\u0027s way, but Drizzt was smiling again, understanding where Catti-brie\u0027s reasoning had led them - and where it had trapped the stubborn king. \"If ye did cut him down, and if that drow was Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, then who would ye have beside ye with the patience to sit and listen to yer prideful boasts?\" the young woman finished. \"At least I\u0027d kill ye clean,\" Bruenor, his blustery bubble popped, muttered to Drizzt. Drizzt\u0027s laughter came straight from his belly. \"Parley,\" he said at length. \"By the well-spoken words of our wise young friend, we must give the goblins at least a chance to explain their intentions.\" He paused and looked wistfully at Catti-brie, his lavender eyes sparkling still, for he knew what to expect from goblins. \"Before we cut them down.\" \"Cleanly,\" Bruenor added. \"She knows nothing of this!\" Wulfgar griped, bringing the tension back to the meeting in an instant. Drizzt silenced him with a cold glare, as threatening a stare as had ever passed between the dark elf and the barbarian. Catti-brie looked from one to the other, her expression pained, then she tapped Regis on the shoulder and together they left the room. \"We\u0027re gonna talk to a bunch o\u0027 goblins?\" Dagna asked in disbelief. \"Aw, shut yer mouth,\" Bruenor answered, slamming his hands back to the table and studying the map once more. It took him several moments to realize that Wulfgar and Drizzt had not finished their silent exchange. Bruenor recognized the confusion underlying Drizzt\u0027s stare, but in looking at the barbarian, he found no subtle undercurrents, no hint that this particular incident would be easily forgotten. Drizzt leaned back against the stone wall in the corridor outside Catti-brie\u0027s room. He had come to talk to the young woman, to find out why she had been so concerned, so adamant, in the conference about the goblin tribe. Catti-brie had always brought a unique perspective to the trials facing the five companions, but this time it seemed to Drizzt that something else was driving her, that something other than goblins had brought the fire to her speech. Leaning on the wall outside the door, the dark elf began to understand. \"You are not going!\" Wulfgar was saying - loudly. \"There will be a fight, despite your attempts to put it off. They are goblins. They\u0027ll take no parley with dwarves!\" \"If there is a fight, then ye\u0027ll be wanting me there,\" Catti-brie retorted. \"You are not going.\" Drizzt shook his head at the finality of Wulfgar\u0027s tone, thinking that never before had he heard Wulfgar speak this way. He changed his mind, though, remembering when he first had met the rough young barbarian, stubborn and proud and talking nearly as stupidly as now. Drizzt was waiting for the barbarian when Wulfgar returned to his own room, the drow leaning against the wall casually, wrists resting against the angled hilts of his magical scimitars and his forest-green cloak thrown back from his shoulders. \"Bruenor sends for me?\" Wulfgar asked, confused as to why Drizzt would be in his room. Drizzt pushed the door closed. \"I am not here for Bruenor,\" he explained evenly. Wulfgar shrugged, not catching on. \"Welcome back, then,\" he said, and there was something strained in his greeting. \"Too oft you are out of the halls. Bruenor desires your company - \" \"I am here for Catti-brie,\" Drizzt interrupted. The barbarian\u0027s ice-blue eyes narrowed immediately and he squared his broad shoulders, his strong jaw firm. \"I know she met with you,\" he said, \"outside on the trails before you came in.\" A perplexed look crossed Drizzt\u0027s face as he recognized the hostility in Wulfgar\u0027s tone. Why would Wulfgar care if Catti-brie had met with him? What in the Nine Hells was going on with his large friend? \"Regis told me,\" Wulfgar explained, apparently misunderstanding Drizzt\u0027s confusion. A superior look came into the barbarian\u0027s eye, as though he believed his secret information had given him some sort of advantage. Drizzt shook his head and brushed his thick white mane back from his face with slender fingers. \"I am not here because of any meeting on the trails,\" he said, \"or because of anything Catti-brie has said to me.\" Wrists still comfortably resting against his weapon hilts, Drizzt strolled across the wide room, stopping opposite the large bed from the barbarian. \"Whatever Catti-brie does say to me, though,\" he had to add, \"is none of your affair.\" Wulfgar did not blink, but Drizzt could see that it took all of the barbarian\u0027s control to stop from leaping over the bed at him. Drizzt, who thought he knew Wulfgar well, could hardly believe the sight. \"How dare you?\" Wulfgar growled through gritted teeth. \"She is my - \" \"Dare I?\" Drizzt shot back. \"You speak of Catti-brie as if she were your possession. I heard you tell her, command her, to remain behind when we go to the goblins.\" \"You overstep your bounds,\" Wulfgar warned. \"You puff like a drunken ore,\" Drizzt returned, and he thought the analogy strangely fitting. Wulfgar took a deep breath, his great chest heaving, to steady himself. A single stride took him the length of the bed to the wall, near the hooks holding his magnificent warhammer. \"Once you were my teacher,\" Wulfgar said calmly. \"Ever was I your friend,\" Drizzt replied. Wulfgar snapped an angry glare on him. \"You speak to me like a father to a child. Beware, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, you are not the teacher anymore.\" Drizzt nearly fell over, especially when Wulfgar, still eyeing him dangerously, pulled Aegis-fang, the mighty warhammer, from the wall. \"Are you the teacher now?\" the dark elf asked. Wulfgar nodded slowly, then blinked in surprise as the scimitars suddenly appeared in Drizzt\u0027s hands. Twinkle, the magical blade the wizard Malchor Harpel had given Drizzt, glowed with a soft blue flame. \"Remember when first we met?\" the dark elf asked. He moved around the bottom of the bed, wisely, since Wulfgar\u0027s longer reach would have given him a distinct advantage with the bed between them. \"Do you remember the many lessons we shared on Kelvin\u0027s Cairn, looking out over the tundra and the campfires of your people?\" Wulfgar turned slowly, keeping the dangerous drow in front of him. The barbarian\u0027s knuckles whitened for lack of blood as he tightly clutched his weapon. \"Remember the verbeeg?\" Drizzt asked, the thought bringing a smile to his face. \"You and I fighting together, winning together, against an entire lair of giants? \"And the dragon, Icingdeath?\" Drizzt went on, holding his other scimitar, the one he had taken from the defeated wyrm\u0027s lair, up before him. \"I remember,\" Wulfgar replied quietly, calmly, and Drizzt started to slide his scimitars back into their sheaths, thinking he had sobered the young man. \"You speak of distant days!\" the barbarian roared suddenly, rushing forward with speed and agility beyond what could be expected from so large a man. He launched a roundhouse punch at Drizzt\u0027s face, clipping the surprised drow on the shoulder as Drizzt ducked. The ranger rolled with the blow, coming to his feet in the far comer of the room, the scimitars back in his hands. \"Time for another lesson,\" he promised, his lavender eyes gleaming with an inner fire that the barbarian had seen many times before. Undaunted, Wulfgar came on, putting Aegis-fang through a series of feints before turning it down in an overhead chop that would have crushed the drow\u0027s skull. \"Has it been too long since last we saw battle?\" Drizzt asked, thinking this whole incident a strange game, perhaps a ritual of manhood for the young barbarian. He brought his scimitars up in a blocking cross above him, easily catching the descending hammer. His legs nearly buckled under the sheer force of the blow. Wulfgar recoiled for a second strike. \"Always thinking of offense,\" Drizzt scolded, snapping the flat sides of his scimitars out, one-two, against the sides of Wulfgar\u0027s face. The barbarian fell back a step and wiped a thin line of blood from his cheek with the back of one hand. Still he did not blink. \"My apology,\" Drizzt said when he saw the blood. \"1 did not mean to cut - \" Wulfgar came over him in a rush, swinging wildly and calling out to Tempus, his god of battle. Drizzt sidestepped the first strike - it took out a fair-sized chunk from the stone wall beside him - and stepped forward toward the warhammer, locking his arm around it to hold it in place. Wulfgar let go of the weapon with one hand, grabbed Drizzt by the front of the tunic, and easily lifted him from the floor. The muscles on the barbarian\u0027s bare arm bulged as he pressed his arm straight ahead, crushing the drow against the wall. Drizzt could not believe the huge man\u0027s strength! He felt as if he would be pushed right through the stone and into the next chamber - at least, he hoped there was a next chamber! He kicked with one leg. Wulfgar ducked back, thinking the kick aimed for his face, but Drizzt hooked the leg over the barbarian\u0027s stiffened arm, inside the elbow. Using the leg for leverage, Drizzt slammed his hand against the outside of Wulfgar\u0027s wrist, bending the arm and freeing him from the wall. He punched out with his scimitar hilt as he fell, connecting solidly on Wulfgar\u0027s nose, and let go his lock on the barbarian\u0027s warhammer. Wulfgar\u0027s snarl sounded inhuman. He took up the hammer for a strike, but Drizzt had dropped to the floor by then. The drow rolled onto his back, planted his feet against the wall, and kicked out, slipping right between Wulfgar\u0027s wide-spread legs. Drizzt\u0027s foot snapped up once, stinging the barbarian\u0027s groin, and then, when he was behind Wulfgar, snapped both feet straight out, kicking the barbarian behind the knees. Wulfgar\u0027s legs buckled and one of his knees slammed into the wall. Drizzt used the momentum to roll again. He came back to his feet and leaped, grabbing the overbalanced Wulfgar by the back of his hair and tugging hard, toppling the man like a cut tree. Wulfgar groaned and rolled, trying to get up, but Drizzt\u0027s scimitars came whipping in, hilts leading, to connect heavily on the big man\u0027s jaw. Wulfgar laughed and slowly rose. Drizzt backed away. \"You are not the teacher,\" Wulfgar said again, but the line of blood-filled spittle rolling from the edge of his torn mouth weakened the claim considerably. \"What is this about?\" Drizzt demanded. \"Speak it now!\" Aegis-fang came hurling at him, end over end. Drizzt dove to the floor, narrowly avoiding the deadly hit. He winced when he heard the hammer hit the wall, no doubt blasting a clean hole in the stone. He was up again, amazingly, by the time the charging barbarian got anywhere near him. Drizzt ducked under the lumbering man\u0027s reach, spun, and kicked Wulfgar in the rump. Wulfgar roared and spun about, only to get hit again in the face with the flat of Drizzt\u0027s blade. This time the line of blood was not so thin. As stubborn as any dwarf, Wulfgar launched another roundhouse punch. \"Your rage defeats you,\" Drizzt remarked as he easily avoided the blow. He couldn\u0027t believe that Wulfgar, so finely trained in the art - and it was an art! - of battle had lost his composure. Wulfgar growled and swung again, but recoiled immediately, for this time, Drizzt put Twinkle, or more particularly, put Twinkle\u0027s razor-edged blade, in line to catch the blow. Wulfgar retracted the swing top late and clutched his bloodied hand. \"I know your hammer will return to your grasp,\" Drizzt said, and Wulfgar seemed almost surprised, as though he had forgotten the magical enchantment of his own weapon. \"Would you like to have fingers remaining so you might catch it?\" On cue, Aegis-fang came into the barbarian\u0027s grasp. Drizzt, stunned by the ridiculous tirade and tired of this whole episode, slipped his scimitars back into their sheaths. He stood barely four feet from the barbarian, well within Wulfgar\u0027s reach, with his hands out wide, defenseless. Somewhere in the fight, when he had realized that this was no game, perhaps, the gleam had flown from his lavender eyes. Wulfgar remained very still for a long moment and closed his eyes. To Drizzt, it seemed as if he was fighting some inner battle. He smiled, then opened his eyes, and let the head of his mighty warhammer dip to the floor. \"My friend,\" he said to Drizzt. \"My teacher. It is good you have returned.\" Wulfgar\u0027s hand reached out toward Drizzt\u0027s shoulder. His fist balled suddenly and shot for Drizzt\u0027s face. Drizzt spun, hooked Wulfgar\u0027s arm with his own, and pulled along the path of the barbarian\u0027s own momentum, sending Wulfgar headlong. Wulfgar got his other hand up in time to grab the drow, though, and took Drizzt along for the tumble. They came up together, propped side by side against the wall, and shared a heartfelt laugh. For the first time since before the meeting in the dining hall, it seemed to Drizzt that he had his old fighting companion beside him again. Drizzt left soon after, not mentioning Catti-brie again - not until he could sort out what, exactly, had just happened in the room. Drizzt at least understood the barbarian\u0027s confusion about the young woman. Wulfgar had come from a tribe dominated by men, where women spoke only when they were told to speak, and did as their masters, the males, bade. It appeared as if, now that he and Catti-brie were to be wed, Wulfgar was finding it difficult to shake off the lessons of his youth. The thought disturbed Drizzt more than a little. He now understood the sadness he had detected in Catti-brie, out on the trails beyond the dwarven complex. He understood, too, Wulfgar\u0027s mounting folly. If the stubborn barbarian tried to quench the fires within Catti-brie, he would take from her everything that had brought him to her in the first place, everything that he loved - that Drizzt, too, loved, in the young woman. Drizzt dismissed that notion summarily; he had looked into her knowing blue eyes for a decade, had seen Catti-brie turn her stubborn father in submissive circles. Neither Wulfgar, nor Drizzt, nor the gods themselves could quench the fires in Catti-brie\u0027s eyes.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-3.html","bookId":2127,"book":{"id":2127,"title":"The Legacy (Legacy of the Drow #1)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #1: The Legacy A new mass market edition of the New York Times best-selling sword and sorcery classic, The Legacy is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best!
