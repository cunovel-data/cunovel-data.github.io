JOHN MAKES SOME ACQUAINTANCES.","content":"JOHN had not walked far when he saw a horse galloping down the street: the people shouted, which only made the horse[13] run the faster; but just as he reached the corner, John made a spring, and, catching the rein, in a moment he was on his back. John’s time, when he lived at the fishing village, had been divided between riding ponies and paddling boats; but he had never ridden so fine an animal as this,—his skin shone like satin, and his saddle and bridle were so handsome, that the little boy concluded he must belong to some very rich captain indeed. \n \n Directly a ragged boy came up to him with ‘Halloo! there, what are you doing with my horse?’ \n \n ‘I caught him,’ said John, ‘but I don’t believe he belongs to you;’ so, touching his side with his heel, the spirited horse set off at full speed, and did not stop till he reached a handsome house, on the steps of which stood a gentleman with a whip in his hand, just ready for a ride. He[14] was pleased to get his horse, and put a shilling in John’s hand for his trouble. \n \n So large a piece of money astonished the child; his eyes glistened, and, without knowing it, he spoke his thoughts: ‘Oh, mother, you need not have cried so!’ \n \n The gentleman was preparing to mount his horse, but hearing these words, he said, ‘What was the matter with your mother?’ \n \n ‘She had no money to buy us bread, sir.’ \n \n ‘Has she no work to do?’ \n \n ‘We have just come here, and mother does not know any one.’ \n \n ‘Why did you come here, boy?’ \n \n John thought this was a foolish question, but he answered, ‘Father was drowned, and mother couldn’t fish, and she was afraid we should starve in the village; but I am more afraid of it here.’ \n \n The gentleman smiled and said, ‘I do not think there is much danger of that.’ \n \n [15]But John looked in his face with a serious countenance, and said, ‘People are obliged to starve when they have no money. I asked the shopkeeper for one biscuit for the baby, and he said he would whip me.’ \n \n ‘The hard-hearted fellow!’ said the stranger to himself; then, looking at his watch, ‘I am hurried now, but bring your mother here this evening.’ As he spoke he rode away; but checking his horse, he called to John, ‘My little lad, have you had your breakfast? Ah! he is gone; I should have thought of that before.’ But happy John was already half way home. As he passed he saw Captain Sam seated before his door, lighting his pipe; and he determined to stop and speak to him. John began to think better of the towns-folk, as he called them; and the thought of having some money in his pocket gave[16] him more confidence, in which our fisherman’s boy resembled people much older and wiser than himself. \n \n When John came near to the captain, his heart began to beat quickly, and he made the best bow that his country education had taught him. It would have been a hard heart that could not feel for him, as he stood with his straw hat in his hand, his brown curling hair setting off his honest countenance, which, young as it was, wore an expression of care. It is sad to see trouble clouding the brow of childhood; but He who sends affliction, will send strength to bear it, if we ask Him. Though John’s father had been dead but a few weeks, he had thought more in that short time than in his whole life before. While he read God’s precious promises to his mother, he learned to pray to that merciful God, and love the kind Saviour. \n \n [17]No doubt it was the Lord’s kindness which turned the heart of the old captain toward the little fatherless boy. No sooner did he see John’s modest bow and serious face than he felt an interest in him. \n \n ‘Sit down on the steps, my little man, and tell me your name. I suppose you live in one of these cottages?’ \n \n John’s simple story was soon told. When he mentioned his father’s name, the old sailor called to his wife, ‘I say, Sally, come here; this is Richard Leddam’s son: many’s the job your father has done for me, child. Wife, give him something to eat; I suspect the locker at home is empty.’ \n \n John’s heart had been so full that he did not know how hungry he was, till Mrs. Newton set before him some bacon and bread. They smiled to see him enjoy his meal; but all at once he stopped eating,[18] and said, ‘Please, sir, let me take this to the children, they are so hungry!’ \n \n ‘Sally,’ said the captain, ‘put some more on the plate; as it’s but a step, we will walk along and see poor Leddam’s little ones.’ \n \n How pleased the children were when they saw their brother, and the good breakfast which he brought them! My young reader, would you know the worth of money? go feed the hungry and clothe the poor orphan. \n \n ‘Have you been to school, John?’ said Captain Sam. \n \n ‘Father taught me to read, sir.’ \n \n ‘He could not have done you a better turn, my lad; but you won’t be a land-lubber, hey!’ \n \n ‘I would like to be a real sailor, sir, like those I saw in the big ships in the bay. Henry wants to be a sailor too.’ \n \n [19]‘Ah!’ said the captain, ‘if you were only a little older; but we will see.’ \n \n Just then the door was opened, and Mrs Leddam returned. She was pale and sad, but her heart seemed to revive when she heard her visitor speak kindly to her. ‘It is a great comfort,’ she said, ‘to know that there is one person in this strange place that feels for these poor children. John has been talking of you, sir, ever since we came here; he is so bent on being a sailor.’ \n \n ‘And a sailor he shall be,’ said the captain, slapping his hands together. ‘I hope you will live to see him sail his own vessel.’ \n \n When their new friends were gone, John told his mother of the message from the strange gentleman, and gave her the money he had received for catching the horse. \n \n [20]‘You have done a better morning’s work than I have,’ she said. \n \n ‘Did you go to many places, mother?’ \n \n ‘I will eat some of this good bread, my son, and then tell you.’ \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2697/74153.html","bookId":1461,"book":{"id":1461,"title":"Captain John\u0027s Adventures","description":"简介： RICHARD LEDDAM was a poor man, who obtained a subsistence by toiling in all weathers in catching fish and oysters, which he sold to persons whose business it was to supply the city market.
