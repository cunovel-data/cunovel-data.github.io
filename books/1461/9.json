He loved every plank in the ‘Sally,’ and had hoped that, by the time he was twenty-five, he would be able to buy out the owner. \\n\\n \\n\\n But though he had laid by every penny that he could spare, he found that he had not half the amount which was required; and what made him feel more discouraged, Captain Morgan wished to sell the vessel immediately, as he intended to retire. \\n\\n \\n\\n John might have made money much faster if he would have worked on the Sabbath, as he saw many do who were in the same business, without any scruples. But he knew that the blessing of God would never rest on those who broke His commandment; and he valued that blessing more than gold and silver. He felt disappointed, but tried to be submissive to the will of God, and to go on in the discharge of his duty. ‘I have been happy[50] here,’ he thought; ‘but if God’s blessing be with me, if I live near to my Saviour, I will be happy wherever I am placed.’ Then, as he noticed the lighter scudding gracefully before the wind, he sighed and said, ‘I shall be grieved to part with my pretty boat.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n His mind was filled with such thoughts as he lay-to, by the side of a ship which had just arrived, laden with passengers and goods. \\n\\n \\n\\n As there was some delay in the arrival of the steamboat, several of the passengers employed John to convey them to the town. Among them John observed an elderly gentleman, who looked pale and feeble. With his usual kindness, the young man stepped forward and assisted the stranger down the side of the ship, and when he was on board the lighter, John wrapped his cloak around him, to protect him from the keen air. \\n\\n \\n\\n [51]They were soon under weigh for the town. While they were sailing along, the stranger, looking up, observed the flag floating from the top of the mast, on which was inscribed the name of the schooner. ‘The “Sally!”’ he said; ‘that name is very familiar to me. Pray, sir,’ turning to John, who was at the helm, ‘what is your name?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘John Leddam, sir.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Mine is Reeder, and you must be Edward’s friend.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n They met like old friends, and Mr Reeder soon made himself acquainted with John’s troubles. He inquired how much money he needed to make up the whole sum for the purchase of the schooner. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Oh, sir,’ said John, ‘a large amount; it will take me three years at least, with good business, to earn it. I could borrow, but I never will run in debt. I wish to go by[52] the Bible rule, “Owe no man anything, but to love one another.”’ \\n\\n \\n\\n The old gentleman smiled, but said nothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n A day or two after this conversation Captain Morgan came to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Well, John, the “Sally” is yours; your friend Mr Reeder will advance the money. He says that he owes you much more than this for saving the life of his son.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2697/74159.html","bookId":1461,"book":{"id":1461,"title":"Captain John\u0027s Adventures","description":"简介： RICHARD LEDDAM was a poor man, who obtained a subsistence by toiling in all weathers in catching fish and oysters, which he sold to persons whose business it was to supply the city market.
