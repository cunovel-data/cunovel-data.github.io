He had, by his good conduct, obtained the confidence of his employer, and was earning high wages. He had saved all his money, that he might be able to buy a share in the schooner, and Captain Sam prophesied that he would soon be a captain himself. His brother Henry had been received into their employment, and was a smart, affectionate boy; but he never could rival John in the affections of Antonio. When Mrs Leddam looked around her and saw the blessings that she enjoyed, her heart was filled with thankfulness; and she often told the old captain that no one need doubt the goodness of God to those who trust in Him. [31]For several years the family had been accustomed to take their Christmas dinner at Captain Sam’s; and you may be sure that John and Antonio, who were always of the party, took care that there was no want of fine fish and a few wild ducks for the occasion. One morning, after enjoying a Christmas festival, they bade farewell to their friends, and jumping gaily on board their little vessel, which they called their home, unfurled the sail and glided down the bay. It was a clear, bright December day. They were bound to a large ship which Captain Morgan had engaged to unload, and where he was expecting to meet them. As they were sailing on pleasantly, Antonio remarked, ‘Boys, I don’t like the looks of the sky.’ ‘Why,’ said Henry, ‘it is as blue and bright as it can be.’ [32]‘It will be dark enough before tomorrow,’ he answered, ‘so let us make more sail; we have a long pull before we reach the ship.’ Before sunset, just as they were in sight of the vessel, the wind, which had breathed gently from the west, veered round to the south-east, and began to blow hard. The water, lately so calm, soon changed its appearance, and the boat danced up and down as the waves grew rough beneath the influence of the wind. Night came upon them; a cold rain commenced falling; and as they laboured hard, hoping to reach the fishing village where John had lived, the tempest increased, and they wished in vain for day. But day never dawned on all that group of friends. ‘Where are we?’ said John, breaking a long silence. A flash of lightning, which blazed on the angry waters, and for[33] a moment lighted up the scene, answered his question, by discovering to them a point of land over which the waves were violently breaking. ‘There is a cove in there,’ said Antonio, ‘if we could only make it.’ ‘It is full of ugly rocks,’ replied John; ‘I remember the place well.’ ‘Ay,’ returned the sailor, ‘I’ll wait for another flash, and try for it.’ John would have dissuaded him, but his voice was lost in the roar of the tempest. He felt the boat tremble, as, obeying the helm, she turned towards the shore; and, catching hold of Henry’s arm, he put his lips to his ear and said, ‘Don’t be frightened if we capsize, but strike out from the boat and swim.’ ‘Oh, brother!’ cried Henry, ‘this is dreadful;’ and he clung to John, who only had time to say, ‘Trust in God, pray[34] to Jesus,’ when the frail vessel was violently hurled against a sunken rock and upset. It was a moment of confusion and struggles for life. Antonio, who was at home in the water, only thought of the boys. He called loudly for them, and heard the voice of John answering. ‘Thank God,’ he said, ‘my own boy is safe; but where is Henry? In the boat, perhaps, entangled in the rigging; how shall I find it in this darkness?’ ‘Oh, Henry, where are you?’ cried John. ‘Here,’ he answered, ‘clinging to the boat; but I am so cold I can’t hold on much longer.’ ‘Keep up your courage,’ said Antonio; ‘I see the boat now, and will be there in a moment; hold on for your life!’ A furious gust of wind and rain passed over them and all was darkness for an[35] instant. Oh, how long even a moment seems in such circumstances! When the blast had swept by, John, who had sustained himself on a floating tree, endeavoured once more to find the schooner. He succeeded, and called out loudly for his brother. A faint voice responded, ‘Brother! brother! can’t you save me?’ and all was silent. For a long time they remained in the storm calling his name, but Henry never spoke again. At last they gave up all hope of saving him, and swimming to the shore, they found a fisherman’s hut, where they obtained torches, and returned. The first object they saw was the body of Henry entangled among the timber with which the cove was filled. The lighter also was floating near him. The storm was abating, and the moon, breaking through the clouds, threw her[36] light on the sad scene. While the fisherman took charge of the boat, John and his friend brought the lifeless boy to land, when Antonio tenderly lifted him in his arms, and carried him to the house. He bitterly reproached himself for running into the cove against John’s advice, but John tried to console him. As he smoothed the wet ringlets on his brother’s brow, and kissed his cold cheek, he said, ‘You did it for the best, Mr Antonio; if it had been the will of God to save him, he would have been alive. I trust he is happy now, for he loved the blessed Saviour.’ The next day poor Henry was buried in the nearest churchyard. We shall not attempt to describe his mother’s grief.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2697/74156.html","bookId":1461,"book":{"id":1461,"title":"Captain John\u0027s Adventures","description":"简介： RICHARD LEDDAM was a poor man, who obtained a subsistence by toiling in all weathers in catching fish and oysters, which he sold to persons whose business it was to supply the city market.
