{"id":18688,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. THE SPANISH SAILOR.","content":"MRS LEDDAM’S prospects began from this time to brighten, through the kindness of Captain Sam, and of the gentleman whose horse John had caught. \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain interested a friend in John’s behalf, who owned a small schooner which was called a lighter, and was used to convey the cargoes of large vessels to the city. He consented to take the little boy, and make a man of him, as he said. John[24] was obliged to work hard in all kinds of weather; but the thought of his mother, and trust in God, reconciled him to every hardship. Captain Morgan, his master, was a kind man, and inclined to be religious. When the work of the day was over, they used to sit in the little cabin of the ‘Sally,’ for so the vessel was named, and, while the captain smoked his pipe, John read to him in his Bible. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now, this little boy was doing good all this time, though he did not think that such a child as he was could be of service to any one. The captain had hired a Spanish sailor to assist him, and to take charge of the boat when he was absent. This Antonio was a strange-looking creature. His skin was very dark, and his hair hung in black locks over his face. Although he seemed stern, and could look very fierce with his large bright eyes, yet beneath[25] his sailor jacket there beat a warm, kind heart. John soon won the good-will of the Spaniard by his obedient and pleasant manners, and as the little boy became attached to his new friend, he felt anxious to do him good. \\n\\n \\n\\n One night, when the captain was away, Antonio brought the fishing net that he was netting into the cabin where John was alone. After they had conversed awhile, John opened the Bible, and proposed to read aloud. Antonio knew nothing of religion, except making the sign of the cross when he was sick or sad; but still he called himself a Roman Catholic, and did not want to hear the Bible read. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Just let me read this part,’ said John. ‘Listen, Mr Antonio; it is about fishermen.’ So, before he could speak, John began to read in Luke of the calling of Peter, and the miraculous draught of fishes.[26] Antonio became interested, and after that he made one of the little party in the cabin, and listened with profit to the word of God. \\n\\n \\n\\n One fine morning they were lying near a small island; the bay was smooth as a mirror, and the trees were reflected, leaf for leaf, in its bosom. Now and then a fish would rise to the surface of the water, take a breath of air, and dive down again. John amused himself in observing some wild ducks swimming in the shallow water, watching for prey with fixed eyes and grave looks, and he smiled to see their disappointment when the little fish were too cunning or too nimble for them. He was interrupted by Antonio coming out of the cabin, dressed in his best clothes. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Why, Mr Antonio, where are you going?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Nowhere,’ he replied. ‘This is my saint’s day.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n [27]‘What’s that?’ inquired John. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Oh, I am named after San Antonio, and this is his day.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Well,’ said John, ‘I have looked through the New Testament, and have never found such a saint there.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Why,’ said Antonio, ‘he was not alive at that time.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Who made him a saint then?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Now, as the sailor had not troubled his head about the matter, he was puzzled to find an answer. At last he honestly confessed he did not know. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Suppose he is a saint,’ said John, ‘what good can he do you?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Oh,’ he answered, ‘he can pray for me, and help me when I am in danger.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n John felt serious when he heard this, and said, ‘In that chapter we read last Sunday, the Lord Jesus says, “Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I[28] will give you rest.” There is nothing said about coming to St Antonio, or St Anyone; but, “Come to me.” I would rather trust to the Saviour. Would not you?’ and as he spoke, he looked affectionately in his friend’s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n Antonio did not reply; but he thought of what had been said, and at night he requested John to read that chapter to him again. \\n\\n \\n\\n But time did not always pass so smoothly with our young friend. Many an hour did he spend drenched with rain and shivering with cold. Often, too, in helping to unload the vessels, he had to endure rude usage from the rough sailors and coal porters. Sometimes his heart was almost broken; but Antonio took his part, and comforted him by his kindness. \\n\\n \\n\\n John tried in every way to show his gratitude; and when they were permitted to[29] visit the town, he prevailed on his friend to stay with him at his own home. These visits were pleasant holidays to John. He took care to bring a supply of fish with him, that he might not burden his mother: and if it happened that they could remain over the Sunday, he kept so close to Antonio that he went to church with him all the day. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a pleasant sight to see the sailor, cleanly dressed, sitting in God’s house, listening to the instructions of the Bible; the young lad at his side watching his looks with such pleasure and interest, for of all things John desired most to see his friend a true Christian. I believe he was more anxious for this than even to be the master of a vessel. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2697/74155.html","bookId":1461,"book":{"id":1461,"title":"Captain John\u0027s Adventures","description":"简介： RICHARD LEDDAM was a poor man, who obtained a subsistence by toiling in all weathers in catching fish and oysters, which he sold to persons whose business it was to supply the city market.
