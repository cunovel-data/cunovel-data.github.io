{"id":18685,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. THEY MOVE TO THE CITY.","content":"THE kind neighbour who loved the Bible, and had read it to the poor widow, came daily to read more of the ‘good words.’ The clergyman too came to visit her in her sorrow, and explained to her the words that had soothed her even while she understood them but imperfectly. Mrs Leddam felt how sinful she had been in living all her life without a thought of[8] God, and now in her affliction she turned to Him whom she had so long forgotten. \n \n The good clergyman spoke to her of Jesus, the Saviour of sinners, through whom alone we can receive pardon and peace; and the poor widow prayed to this blessed Saviour as she had never prayed before, and He heard her and comforted her heart; for He has said, ‘Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out.’ \n \n As John was too young to manage the boat, it was sold with the nets and fishing tackle, and the widow with her five children removed to the neighbouring town, where she hoped to find employment in sewing. She hired a small house in the outskirts of the town; and there, with her little flock around her, she felt like a desolate stranger. \n \n How little do those children who are blessed with many comforts know of the trials of the poor and fatherless! \n \n [9]But the widow had now a source of comfort in her trials. John daily read some of the ‘good words’ to his mother. They rejoiced in God’s many promises to the widow and the fatherless, and trusted that He would provide. The town was situated on the bank of a broad river, and the widow’s cottage stood not far from the water. Near it stood a small house, which one would have said had been built by a sailor; and he would have said rightly, for Captain Sam had made his dwelling as much like the vessel in which he had spent his best days as he could. In front of the house was a small porch, shaded by a sail; and here the old man passed the most of his time, smoking his pipe. The poor neighbours thought that Captain Sam was a rich man, because he could afford to do nothing. \n \n Within sight of the captain’s house was[10] a grocer’s shop, where every morning numbers of poor children came to procure supplies for the day. Among them the captain observed John and Henry, as having clean faces, and as being neatly dressed. John’s attention had been attracted by the captain’s house. He admired the bright colour with which it was painted, and had conceived a great respect for its happy owner; for John, like the rest, thought it must be very pleasant to be idle,—a great mistake, as any one who will try it may soon discover. Hearing the shopkeeper call him captain, he asked, ‘Is he a real captain, sir?’ \n \n ‘How do I know, youngster?’ replied the man. ‘You had better ask him that yourself.’ \n \n The next day, observing his mother weeping, John said, ‘Mother, can’t I get work?’ \n \n [11]She laid her hand on his head as she replied, ‘What could you do, my son?’ \n \n ‘A heap of things,’ he said earnestly. ‘I can help to row, and mend the nets.’ \n \n ‘But we are now far away from the fishing. We are in a strange place, full of people, where, in the midst of plenty, we are likely to come to want; for this is the last money I have in the world.’ \n \n ‘Oh, mother!’ said the terrified boy, ‘will they let us starve? won’t some of the rich people help you?’ \n \n ‘I am going in search of work,’ replied his mother. ‘Take care of your brother and sisters until I return.’ \n \n ‘May I walk as far as the corner, mother?’ \n \n Giving him permission to do so, Mrs Leddam left the house. \n \n Now John had a plan of his own, but he was puzzled to know how to bring it[12] about. He had often accompanied his father to the vessels in the bay, and had a strong partiality for sailors. He thought if he could but make a friend of this rich captain, who lived in the fine house, how happy he should be. So, after thinking it over, he resolved to see the captain, and tell him how poor his mother was. Bidding Henry watch his baby sister, he set out for the corner; but as he walked on he felt his courage become fainter, until his young heart almost failed. \n \n But we will turn to a new chapter to relate his introduction to the captain. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2697/74152.html","bookId":1461,"book":{"id":1461,"title":"Captain John\u0027s Adventures","description":"简介： RICHARD LEDDAM was a poor man, who obtained a subsistence by toiling in all weathers in catching fish and oysters, which he sold to persons whose business it was to supply the city market.
