{"id":17752,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"“My God, will you look who\u0027s here! Billy, wretched creature, I haven\u0027t laid eyes on you for two months! Do you have to desert me entirely, just because you\u0027ve fallen in love with a society girl with the face of a Japanese doll-baby? What\u0027s the matter with me, that I lose my lovers faster than I get them? Edgerton Rosythe, come in here—you\u0027ve got a good excuse, I admit—I\u0027m almost as much scared of your wife as you are yourself. But still, I\u0027d like a chance to get tired of some man first. Hello, Planchet, how\u0027s my old grannie making out in your scalping-shop? Say, would you think it would take three days labor for half a dozen Sioux squaws to pull the skin off one old lady\u0027s back? And a week to tie up the corners of her mouth and give her a permanent smile! \u0027Why, grannie,\u0027 I said, \u0027good God, it would be cheaper to hire Charlie Chaplin to walk round in front of you all the rest of your life!\u0027 And—why, what\u0027s this? For the love of Peter, somebody introduce me to this gentleman. Is he a friend of yours, Billy? Carpenter? Excuse me, Mr. Carpenter, but we picture people learn to talk about our faces and our styles, and it isn\u0027t every day I come on a million dollars walking round on two legs. Who does the gentleman work for?” The storm of Mary Magna stopped long enough for her to stare from one to another of us. “What? You mean nobody\u0027s got him? And you all standing round here, not signing any contracts? You, Edgerton—you haven\u0027t run to the telephone to call up Eternal City? Well, as it happens, T-S is going to be here in five minutes—his wife is being made beautiful once again somewhere in this scalping-shop. Take my advice, Mr. Carpenter, and don\u0027t sign today—the price will go up several hundred per week as long as you hold off.” Mary stopped again; and this was most unusual, for as a general rule she never stopped until somebody or something stopped her. But she was fascinated by the spectacle of Carpenter. “My good God! Where did he come from? Why, it seems like—I\u0027m trying to think—yes, it\u0027s the very man! Listen, Billy; you may not believe it, but I was in a church a couple of weeks ago. I went to see Roxanna Riddle marry that grand duke fellow. It was in a big church over by the park—St. Bartholomew\u0027s, they call it. I sat looking at a stained glass window over the altar, and Billy, I swear I believe this Mr. Carpenter came down from that window!” “Maybe he did, Mary,” I put in. “But I\u0027m not joking! I tell you he\u0027s the living, speaking image of that figure. Come to think of it, he isn\u0027t speaking, he hasn\u0027t said a word! Tell me, Mr. Carpenter, have you got a voice, or are you only a close up from \u0027The Servant in the House\u0027 or \u0027Ben Hur\u0027? Say something, so I can get a line on you!” Again I stood wondering; how would Carpenter take this? Would he bow his head and run before a hail-storm of feminine impertinence? Would she “vamp” him, as she did every man who came near her? Or would this man do what no man alive had yet been able to do—reduce her to silence? He smiled gently; and I saw that she had vamped him this much, at least—he was going to be polite! “Mary,” he said, “I think you are carrying everything but the nose jewels.” “Nose jewels? What a horrid idea! Where did you get that?” “When you came in, I was quoting the prophet Isaiah. Some eighty generations of ladies have lived on earth since his day, Mary; they have won the ballot, but apparently they haven\u0027t discovered anything new in the way of ornaments. Some of the prophet\u0027s words may be strange to you, but if you study them you will see that you\u0027ve got everything he lists: \u0027their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, the chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, the rings, and nose jewels, the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, the glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils.\u0027” As Carpenter recited this list, his eyes roamed from one part to another of the wondrous “get up” of Mary Magna. You can imagine her facing him—that bold and vivid figure which you have seen as “Cleopatra” and “Salome,” as “Dubarry” and “Anne Boleyn,” and I know not how many other of the famous courtesans and queens of history. In daily life her style and manner is every bit as staggering; she is a gorgeous brunette, and wears all the colors there are—when she goes down the street it is like a whole procession with flags. I\u0027ll wager that, apart from her jewels, which may or may not have been real, she was carrying not less than five thousand dollars worth of stuff that fall afternoon. A big black picture hat, with a flower garden and parts of an aviary on top—but what\u0027s the use of going over Isaiah\u0027s list? “Everything but the nose jewels,” said Carpenter, “and they may be in fashion next week.” “How about the glasses?” put in Rosythe, entering into the fun. “Oh, shucks!” said I, protecting my friend. “Turn out the contents of your vanity-bag, Mary.” “And the crisping-pins?” laughed the critic. “Hasn\u0027t Madame Planchet just shown us those?” All this while Mary had not taken her eyes off Carpenter. “So you are really one of those religious fellows!” she exclaimed. “You\u0027ll know exactly what to do without any directing! How perfectly incredible!” And at that appropriate moment T-S pushed open the door and waddled in!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3227/88115.html","bookId":699,"book":{"id":699,"title":"They Call Me Carpenter","description":"简介： The beginning of this strange adventure was my going to see a motion picture which had been made in Germany.
