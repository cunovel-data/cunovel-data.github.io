{"id":17754,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"“My Gawd!” gasped Mrs. T-S. “I\u0027m dyin\u0027!” Her husband responded, beaming, “So you gone and done it again!” Said Mrs. T-S: “I\u0027ll never do it no more!” Said the husband: “Y\u0027allus say dat. Fergit it, Maw, you\u0027re all right now, you don\u0027t have to have your hair frizzed fer six mont\u0027s!” Said Mrs. T-S: “I gotta lie down. I\u0027m dyin\u0027, Abey, I tell you. Lemme git on de sofa.” Said the husband: “Now, Maw, we gotta git to dinner—” “I can\u0027t eat no dinner.” “Vot?” There was genuine alarm in the husband\u0027s voice. “You can\u0027t eat no dinner? Sure you gotta eat your dinner. You can\u0027t live if you don\u0027t eat. Come along now, Maw.” “O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh!” T-S went and stood before her, and a grin came over his face. “Sure, now, ain\u0027t it fine? Say, Mary, look at dem lovely curves. Billy, shoost look here! Vy, she looks like a kid again, don\u0027t she! Madame, you\u0027re a daisy—you sure deliver de goods.” Madame Planchet beamed, and the flesh-mountain was feebly cheered. “You like it, Abey?” “Sure, I like it! Maw, it\u0027s grand! It\u0027s like I got a new girl! Come on now, git up, we go git our dinner, and den we gotta see dem night scenes took. Don\u0027t forgit, we\u0027re payin\u0027 two tousand men five dollars apiece tonight, and we gotta git our money out of \u0027em.” Then, taking for granted that this settled it, he turned to the rest. “You come vit us, Mary?” “I must wait for my grannie.” “Sure, you leave your car fer grannie, and you come vit us, and we git some dinner, and den we see dem mob scenes took. You come along, Mr. Carpenter, I gotta have some talk vit you. And you, Billy? And Rosythe—come, pile in.” “I have to wait for the missus,” said the critic. “We have a date.” “Vell,” said T-S, and he went up close. “You do me a favor, Rosythe; don\u0027t say nuttin\u0027 about dis fellow Carpenter tonight. I feed him and git him feelin\u0027 good, and den I make a contract vit him, and I give you a front page telegraph story, see?” “All right,” said the critic. “Mum\u0027s de vord now,” said the magnate; and he waddled out, and the two caryatids lifted the flesh-mountain, and half carried it to the elevator, and Mary walked with Carpenter, and I brought up the rear. The car of T-S was waiting at the door, and this car is something special. It is long, like a freight-car, made all of shining gun-metal, or some such material; the huge wheels are of solid metal, and the fenders are so big and solid, it looks like an armored military car. There is an extra wheel on each side, and two more locked on to the rear. There is a chauffeur in uniform, and a footman in uniform, just to open the doors and close them and salute you as you enter. Inside, it is all like the sofas in Madame\u0027s scalping shop; you fall into them, and soft furs enfold you, and you give a sigh of Contentment, “O-o-o-o-o-o-oh!” “Prince\u0027s,” said T-S to the chauffeur, and the palace on wheels began to glide along. It occurred to me to wonder that T-S was not embarrassed to take Carpenter to a fashionable eating-place. But I could read his thoughts; everybody would assume that he had been “on location” with one of his stars; and anyhow, what the hell? Wasn\u0027t he Abey Tszchniczklefritszch? “Wor-r-r-r-r! Wor-r-r-r-r-r!” snarled the horn of the car; and I could understand the meaning of this also. It said: “I am the car of Abey Tszchniczklefritszch, king of the movies, future king of the world. Get the hell out o\u0027 my way!” So we sped through the crowded streets, and pedestrians scattered like autumn leaves before a storm. “My Gawd, but I\u0027m hungry!” said T-S. “I ain\u0027t had nuttin\u0027 to eat since lunch-time. How goes it, Maw? Feelin\u0027 better? Vell, you be all right ven you git your grub.” So we came to Prince\u0027s, and drew up before the porte-cochere, and found ourselves confronting an adventure. There was a crowd before the place, a surging throng half-way down the block, with a whole line of policemen to hold them back. Over the heads of the crowd were transparencies, frame boxes with canvas on, and lights inside, and words painted on them. “Hello!” cried T-S. “Vot\u0027s dis?” Suddenly I recalled what I had read in the morning\u0027s paper. The workers of the famous lobster palace had gone on strike, and trouble was feared. I told T-S, and he exclaimed: “Oh, hell! Ain\u0027t we got troubles enough vit strikers in de studios, vitout dey come spoilin\u0027 our dinner?” The footman had jumped from his seat, and had the door open, and the great man began to alight. At that moment the mob set up a howl. “For shame! For shame! Unfair! Don\u0027t go in there! They starve their workers! They\u0027re taking the bread out of our mouths! Scabs! Scabs!” I got out second, and saw a spectacle of haggard faces, shouting menaces and pleadings; I saw hands waved wildly, one or two fists clenched; I saw the police, shoving against the mass, poking with their sticks, none too gently. A poor devil in a waiter\u0027s costume stretched out his arms to me, yelling in a foreign dialect: “You take de food from my babies!” The next moment the club of a policeman came down on his head, crack. I heard Mary scream behind me, and I turned, just in the nick of time. Carpenter was leaping toward the policeman, crying, “Stop!” There was no chance to parley in this emergency. I grabbed Carpenter in a foot-ball tackle. I got one arm pinned to his side, and Mary, good old scout, got the other as quickly. She is a bit of an athlete—has to keep in training for those hoochie-coochies and things she does, when she wins the love of emperors and sultans and such-like world-conquerors. Also, when we got hold of Carpenter, we discovered that he wasn\u0027t much but skin and bones anyhow. We fairly lifted him up and rushed him into the restaurant; and after the first moment he stopped resisting, and let us lead him between the aisles of diners, on the heels of the toddling T-S. There was a table reserved, in an alcove, and we brought him to it, and then waited to see what we had done.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3227/88117.html","bookId":699,"book":{"id":699,"title":"They Call Me Carpenter","description":"简介： The beginning of this strange adventure was my going to see a motion picture which had been made in Germany.
