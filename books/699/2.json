I said, with a smile, “Can it be that the American people are not so dead to art after all?” But then I observed that the crowd seemed to be swaying this way and that; also there seemed to be a great many men in army uniforms. “Hello!” I exclaimed. “A row?” There was a clamor of shouting; the army men seemed to be pulling and pushing the civilians. When we got nearer, I asked of a bystander, “What\u0027s up?” The answer was: “They don\u0027t want \u0027em to go in to see the picture.” “Why not?” “It\u0027s German. Hun propaganda!” Now you must understand, I had helped to win a war, and no man gets over such an experience at once. I had a flash of suspicion, and glanced at my companion, the cultured literary critic from Berlin. Could it possibly be that this smooth-spoken gentleman was playing a trick upon me—trying, possibly, to get something into my crude American mind without my realizing what was happening? But I remembered his detailed account of the production, the very essence of “art for art\u0027s sake.” I decided that the war was three years over, and I was competent to do my own thinking. Dr. Henner spoke first. “I think,” he said, “it might be wiser if I did not try to go in there.” “Absurd!” I cried. “I\u0027m not going to be dictated to by a bunch of imbeciles!” “No,” said the other, “you are an American, and don\u0027t have to be. But I am a German, and I must learn.” I noted the flash of bitterness, but did not resent it. “That\u0027s all nonsense, Dr. Henner!” I argued. “You are my guest, and I won\u0027t—” “Listen, my friend,” said the other. “You can doubtless get by without trouble; but I would surely rouse their anger, and I have no mind to be beaten for nothing. I have seen the picture several times, and can talk about it with you just as well.” “You make me ashamed of myself,” I cried—“and of my country!” “No, no! It is what you should expect. It is what I had in mind when I spoke of the surgeon contracting the disease. We German intellectuals know what war means; we are used to things like this.” Suddenly he put out his hand. “Good-bye.” “I will go with you!” I exclaimed. But he protested—that would embarrass him greatly. I would please to stay, and see the picture; he would be interested later on to hear my opinion of it. And abruptly he turned, and walked off, leaving me hesitating and angry. At last I started towards the entrance of the theatre. One of the men in uniform barred my way. “No admittance here!” “But why not?” “It\u0027s a German show, and we aint a-goin\u0027 to allow it.” “Now see here, buddy,” I countered, none too good-naturedly, “I haven\u0027t got my uniform on, but I\u0027ve as good a right to it as you; I was all through the Argonne.” “Well, what do you want to see Hun propaganda for?” “Maybe I want to see what it\u0027s like.” “Well, you can\u0027t go in; we\u0027re here to shut up this show!” I had stepped to one side as I spoke, and he caught me by the arm. I thought there had been talk enough, and gave a sudden lurch, and tore my arm free. “Hold on here!” he shouted, and tried to stop me again; but I sprang through the crowd towards the box-office. There were more than a hundred civilians in or about the lobby, and not more than twenty or thirty ex-service men maintaining the blockade; so a few got by, and I was one of the lucky ones. I bought my ticket, and entered the theatre. To the man at the door I said: “Who started this?” “I don\u0027t know, sir. It\u0027s just landed on us, and we haven\u0027t had time to find out.” “Is the picture German propaganda?” “Nothing like that at all, sir. They say they won\u0027t let us show German pictures, because they\u0027re so much cheaper; they\u0027ll put American-made pictures out of business, and it\u0027s unfair competition.” “Oh!” I exclaimed, and light began to dawn. I recalled Dr. Henner\u0027s remark about producing a great many ideas out of a very little food; assuredly, the American picture industry had cause to fear competition of that sort! I thought of old “T-S,” as the screen people call him for short—the king of the movie world, with his roll of fat hanging over his collar, and his two or three extra chins! I though of Mary Magna, million dollar queen of the pictures, contriving diets and exercises for herself, and weighing with fear and trembling every day!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3227/88107.html","bookId":699,"book":{"id":699,"title":"They Call Me Carpenter","description":"简介： The beginning of this strange adventure was my going to see a motion picture which had been made in Germany.
