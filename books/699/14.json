I understood that he wanted to enjoy his dinner, and proposed to talk about something pleasant in the meantime. “I vonna tell you about dis picture ve\u0027re goin\u0027 to see took, Mr. Carpenter. I vant you should see de scale we do tings on, ven we got a big subjic. Y\u0027unnerstand, dis is a feature picture ve\u0027re makin\u0027 now; a night picture, a big mob scene.”. “Mob scene?” said Carpenter. “You have so many mobs in this world of yours!” “Vell, sure,” said T-S. “You gotta take dis vorld de vay you find it. Y\u0027can\u0027t change human nature, y\u0027know. But dis vot you\u0027re gonna see tonight is only a play mob, y\u0027unnerstand.” “That is what seems strangest of all to me,” said the other, thoughtfully. “You like mobs so well that you make imitation ones!” “Vell, de people, dey like to see crowds in a picture, and dey like to see action. If you gonna have a big picture, you gotta spend de money.” “Why not take this real mob that is outside the door?” “Ha, ha, ha! Ve couldn\u0027t verk dat very good, Mr. Carpenter. Ve gotta have it in de right set; and ven you git a real mob, it don\u0027t alvays do vot you vant exactly! Besides, you can\u0027t take night pictures unless you got your lights and everyting. No, ve gotta make our mobs to order; we got two tousand fellers hired—” “What Mr. Rosythe called \u0027studio bums\u0027? You have that many?” “Sure, we could git ten tousand if de set vould hold \u0027em. Dis picture is called \u0027De Tale o\u0027 Two Cities,\u0027 and it\u0027s de French revolution. It\u0027s about a feller vot takes anodder feller\u0027s place and gits his head cut off; and say, dere\u0027s a sob story in it vot\u0027s a vunder. Ven dey brought me de scenario, I says, \u0027Who\u0027s de author?\u0027 Dey says, \u0027It\u0027s a guy named Charles Dickens.\u0027 \u0027Dickens?\u0027 says I. \u0027Vell, I like his verk.

Vell, dey can have deir fun—how de hell\u0027s a feller like me gonna git time to know about writers? Vy, only twelve years ago, Maw here and me vas carryin\u0027 pants in a push-cart fer a livin\u0027, and we didn\u0027t know if a book vas top-side up or bottom—ain\u0027t it, Maw?” Maw certified that it was—though I thought not quite so eagerly as her husband. There were five little T-S\u0027s growing up, and bringing pressure to let the dead past stay buried, in Vestminster Abbey or wherever it might be. The waiter brought the dinner, and spread it before us. And T-S tucked his napkin under both ears, and grabbed his knife in one hand and his fork in the other, and took a long breath, and said: “Good-bye, folks. See you later!” And he went to work.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3227/88119.html","bookId":699,"book":{"id":699,"title":"They Call Me Carpenter","description":"简介： The beginning of this strange adventure was my going to see a motion picture which had been made in Germany.
