{"id":2587,"title":"The Dark and Hollow Places (The Forest of Hands and Teeth #3)","description":"Storyline: The Dark and Hollow Places (The Forest of Hands and Teeth #3) \\n There are many things that Annah would like to forget: the look on her sister\u0027s face before Annah left her behind in the Forest of Hands and Teeth, her first glimpse of the Horde as they swarmed the Dark City, the sear of the barbed wire that would scar her for life. But most of all, Annah would like to forget the morning Elias left her for the Recruiters. \\n Annah\u0027s world stopped that day, and she\u0027s been waiting for Elias to come home ever since. Somehow, without him, her life doesn\u0027t feel much different than the dead that roam the wasted city around her. Until she meets Catcher, and everything feels alive again. \\n But Catcher has his own secrets. Dark, terrifying truths that link him to a past Annah has longed to forget, and to a future too deadly to consider. And now it\u0027s up to Annah: can she continue to live in a world covered in the blood of the living? Or is death the only escape from the Return\u0027s destruction?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-and-hollow-places-the-forest-of-hands-and-teeth-3.jpg","author":"Carrie Ryan","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
