{"id":85765,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"\"Avi, why don\u0027t you wait in the living room while I talk to Amy a minute.\"\n Avi rubs his hand over his crew cut, stalling, and I can tell he wants to stay and be my protector.\n \"Dad, you\u0027re embarrassing me,\" I say after I tell Avi to wait in the living room so he doesn\u0027t have to hear my dad\u0027s lecture.\n \"This won\u0027t take long, Amy. Just cool it.\"\n \"If it\u0027s about sex, Mom already told me about it.\"\n \"Yeah, well now you\u0027re going to get the Dad version, okay?\" He rubs his hands together as if he\u0027s about to do some heavy weightlifting. The noise of his dry hands making sandpaper sounds makes me wish I\u0027d forced him to buy the hand cream the manicure lady suggested he get. He clears his throat and says, \"No sex.\"\n \"Got it. Thanks for the talk, Dad. Totally helped. Glad we\u0027re on the same page.\"\n \"Amy...\" he says in a warning tone.\n I moan, situate my pillows which are strewn across my bed, and lean back on them. \"What?\"\n \"Avi is eighteen, a man. You. just turned seventeen--\"\n \"Over a month ago,\" I interrupt.\n \"Yes, well, guys are different than girls. Guys, um, have urges and, um, so you have to be careful, and uh, your own body is changing and, uh, you know. You might be having, um, feelings, too...\"\n All those ums and uhs are making my brain twitch.\n \"Aba, maybe you should have gone to that seminar our school had last year about talking to your kids about sex.\n Mom went. She said to be careful; there\u0027s a lot of diseases. And to protect myself at all times, no matter what. And that if a guy tells me I have to do something in order for him to like me, then I should give him the old heave-ho. And that the risks of having sex at my age so outweigh the benefits. And that I can still be a teenager and liked without exploiting myself or my values. Does that cover it?\"\n He looks stunned. \"I guess so.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you trust Avi?\"\n \"Honey, I don\u0027t trust any guy with my daughter. And something funky was going on here between you two before I came back.\"\n \"Aba, nothing was going on.\"\n My dad bends down, picks up my Care Bear from the floor, and tosses it to me. \"You can\u0027t pull the wool over these Israeli eyes.\"\n \"You\u0027re an Israeli with paranoid eyes,\" I tell him.\n \"That\u0027s a good thing. Call it an occupational hazard. We need to set up a few rules now that Avi\u0027s here.\"\n I hate the word \"rules.\" It diminishes your fun, freedom, and spontaneity. \"Hit me with \u0027em,\" I say, knowing it\u0027s no use arguing.\n \"No boys in your bedroom. You and Avi can hang out in the family room, living room, and kitchen.\"\n \"Aba, I was just giving him a tour of the condo.\"\n \"Sure,\" he says, obviously not believing me. \"Rule number two: no sneaking out to the living room to visit Avi in the middle of the night.\"\n \"Why don\u0027t you just lock me in the room so I don\u0027t escape,\" I say sarcastically. \"Don\u0027t tempt me, Amy.\"\n I roll my eyes. \"Dad, a lot of my friends are more experienced than I am.\"\n \"That\u0027s their parents\u0027 problem, not mine.\"\n I stand and face him. \"I mean, if I wanted to do something I\u0027d have done it. I\u0027m not ready. Don\u0027t worry.\"\n Before he can continue his lecture, I open the door and find Avi. He\u0027s going through his duffle in the living room.\n \"Everything okay?\" he asks.\n \"I got the sex lecture,\" I tell him.\n \"Avi, boyenna b\u0027vakasha,\" my dad calls out.\n Oh, no. \"What did he say?\"\n Avi stands. \"I think I\u0027m about to get the sex lecture, too.\" He walks to the back of the condo, where my dad is. Oh, great.\n Why doesn\u0027t my dad trust me? I mean, I\u0027m not the kind of kid who usually rebels by hanging out with druggies and drinkers. I\u0027m clean cut. Okay, so I\u0027ve stolen my dad\u0027s credit card and this summer I had feelings for Avi that surprised me...and I tested those feelings. But isn\u0027t that what teenagers are supposed to do?\n I eye Avi\u0027s open duffle. Not much in there besides jeans, socks, shirts, and underwear--those tight boxer-ones like the ones in the Calvin Klein ads.\n Behind me someone\u0027s clearing their throat. I jerk myself up, startled, and turn to Avi.\n He nods, then says, \"I got the sex lecture.\"\n \"Was it harsh?\"\n \"Let\u0027s just say your dad tried to convince me he has the knowledge to kill me with one finger.\"\n My dad walks into the room, looking pretty smug I might add. Sure, he just threatened Avi\u0027s life if he probably so much as looked at me.\n \"Arg!\"\n Mutt is oblivious as he takes a squeaky hamburger in his mouth and drops it at my feet. I pick it up and throw it down the hallway. He bolts after it and brings it back for another round.\n \"I met with Mr. Obermeyer downstairs when I took Mutt for his walk,\" my dad informs me as he watches Mutt slide past him. \"We had a long talk, which seems to be the theme of my day.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"And he said he\u0027s taking Princess to the vet tomorrow to see if she\u0027s pregnant. If she is, we\u0027ll deal with the consequences then.\"\n \"Thanks, Aba.\"\n \"It\u0027ll all work out; don\u0027t worry. Listen, I\u0027ve got some work to do and you\u0027ve got school tomorrow, so I think you should both say your goodnights and go to bed.\"\n Since Avi\u0027s bed is the couch, I pull out of the hall closet bed linens and a blanket. I feel Avi\u0027s eyes on me as we make the bed together. \"I wish we were back in Israel,\" I say. \"This summer we had no rules to deal with, nobody telling us what we can and can\u0027t do... it was awesome.\"\n \"This is your dad\u0027s territory, his house, and his rules.\"\n \"Goodie for me.\" Isn\u0027t this my territory and my house, too? When can I start making my own rules up? Or be trusted enough not to have any rules?\n When the couch is transformed into a bed, I turn to Avi. \"You can use the bathroom to get ready first.\"\n \"Todah\" he says, grabbing a toothbrush, toothpaste, and blue flannel pants.\n \"You\u0027re welcome.\"\n I hurry into my room and dress in a tank and shorts, my usual pajama attire. I sit on my bed and stare at the picture of Avi on my nightstand and can\u0027t believe he\u0027s really here ... in my house, in my life again. It\u0027s not as perfect as it was in Israel, but there\u0027s something about Avi that calms my soul.\n At the same time, I try to warn myself that he\u0027s only here for a week and not forever. He\u0027s leaving soon and I\u0027ll be left alone again... no date for the Valentine\u0027s Dance, no date for New Year\u0027s Eve, no date for Valentine\u0027s Day, and no date for the Fourth of July fireworks if the summer trip to Israel doesn\u0027t go through.\n Nathan\u0027ll be around, though. Every day.\n Why am I thinking about Nathan when Avi is here? I don\u0027t even like Nathan, or his emerald eyes.\n Surely I gave Avi enough time to change and brush his teeth. But the door to the bathroom opens just as I reach it and Avi comes out...shirtless, with his hair wet from showering.\n Bronzed skin, chocolate eyes, hair that looks almost black when wet. \"Hi,\" I say.\n He rakes his fingers through his wet hair. \"Sorry I took so long. I needed a shower. I felt dirty from the flight and all.\"\n \"I think I\u0027m gonna need that sex talk again,\" I whisper, then give him a self-conscious smile and move past him to lock myself in the bathroom.\n Looking at myself in the bathroom mirror, I wonder what makes Avi think I\u0027m on the same level looks-wise as him. My teeth aren\u0027t perfect, my top lip disappears when I smile, my hair is too frizzy, and my boobs are a cup size too big. I even kept my bra on with my pjs because I don\u0027t want Avi noticing how much my boobage sags when I unleash \"the girls.\"\n He said that he likes me because I expect life to be perfect. Who doesn\u0027t fight for things to go their way? I guess some people, even Jessica, settle for the status quo. It\u0027s in my nature to fight. I guess I can blame that trait on my dad.\n I\u0027ve also come to realize that with turning seventeen, I\u0027ve become boy crazy. I think about them all the time. It started when I met Avi, and hasn\u0027t stopped. Sometimes I\u0027ll think about boys at the strangest times, like in conversion class or even when I\u0027m shopping. Last week when Jessica was telling me about her dance competition, my mind wrapped around the word \"dance\" and my thoughts wandered to when I was in Israel this past summer at a disco and I watched Avi dance. He\u0027s an amazing dancer, so comfortable moving his body to music, unlike most guys I know.\n Maybe the rules are a good thing, after all.\n I peek into the living room before I go to bed. Avi is laying on the couch, the blanket covering his bottom half but his toned chest is exposed. He\u0027s got one arm resting behind his head, which makes his bicep tense up. \"What?\"\n \"Are you on steroids or something?\"\n He laughs. \"You ever try holding a Kalashnikov assault rifle over your head while walking five kilometers in water up to your waist twice a day. Your arms would be just as big. The gun touches the water, you get another kilometer tacked on.\"\n No thank you very much. \"I thought you trained in the desert.\"\n \"We did that, too. It\u0027s either holding the jerikon full of water, which is over twenty kilos, or being one of four supporting the heaviest guy in the unit on a stretcher while running. And no matter where you are, if the unit leader tells you to drop on the ground, you go down... whether it\u0027s on sharp rocks or not.\"\n \"How did you get the scars on your arms?\" I ask, now focused on the raw skin on his forearms.\n \"Ground-crawling exercises. Fun stuff. Now can we stop talking about the army?\"\n \"What do you want to talk about?\" I sit on the edge of the mahogany coffee table in front of the couch.\n \"Tell me about your city. What makes it so special?\"\n Chicago is unique, unlike any place in the world. I can say just one thing about it and start rambling. \"We have world-famous museums, the largest indoor aquarium, every sport team you could imagine with dedicated-to-the-death fans. We have Lincoln Park Zoo, one of the only free zoos in the country and the Harold Washington library, which is the largest of its kind in the world. We have three of the tallest buildings in the world and the best food in the entire country, which includes pizza, sushi, hot dogs, and Italian beef. You want me to go on?\"\n Avi sits up. \"Your eyes light up when you talk about your city.\"\n \"I love Chicago. I was born at Weiss Memorial not too far away from here and have lived here my whole life. My mom moved to the suburbs so now I live with my dad. I can\u0027t stand not being here. The energy of the city is contagious. My mom and her new husband are having a baby in their new house, anyway, and don\u0027t need me hanging around.\"\n \"Does it bother you that they\u0027re going to have a kid?\"\n I chip more polish off my nails. \"Yeah. It\u0027s going to change our whole family. Just when I\u0027m trying to get used to a permanent man in my mom\u0027s life, I now have to deal with a baby. It\u0027s totally strange. I\u0027m, like, confused about where my family begins and where it ends. No small nuclear family for me. In fact, I don\u0027t even know who my immediate family is anymore.\"\n I\u0027ve never been a fan of change, and my life has changed way too much in the past six months.\n \"Amy, I thought you were in bed,\" my dad says from the hallway.\n \"I was just saying goodnight to Avi.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-20.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: \n How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) \n In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
