{"id":85750,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"In his last letter he wrote about stars. He said in the Negev Desert at night he looked up and the sky was so clear he could swear he saw a billion stars.\\n\\n He said he thought of me right there, wondering what I was doing under the same stars. My heart just about melted into garlic butter sauce (which I love to dip my pizza in) when I read his letter. Sometimes I feel like he has the right perspective on life. Me? I\u0027d probably look up at billions of stars and think, I\u0027m so insignificant.\\n\\n I sit on my bed and open my backpack. There, staring back at me, is the personals section. I must have shoved it in there accidentally. I wipe my eyes and focus on the paper.\\n\\n A small idea, as tiny as a faraway star, starts forming in the back of my mind.\\n\\n If Mom and Marc can create their own little suburban family, I\u0027m going to create one of my own for my bachelor dad... right here in the city.\\n\\n After all, what\u0027s wrong with placing a personal ad for my dad? Maybe, as Maria said, he could meet his own soul mate.\\n\\n 3\\n\\n Kosher question # 1: In Leviticus (11:1), God lists what\u0027s kosher and what\u0027s not. Nowhere in the entire Bible does it mention anything about spicy tuna sushi rolls with little pieces of tempura crunch inside.\\n\\n Hunky, brooding single Jewish dad with an adorable teenage daughter seeks woman for dinners, dancing, and walks in the park. Needs to like dogs and be fee of any neurosis or hang-ups.\\n\\n \"Amy, I\u0027m home. And I brought sushi for you.\"\\n\\n I shove the draft into my backpack and rush for the door. Okay, okay, I know the ad needs a little tweaking. But I\u0027ll deal with that later. Sushi can\u0027t wait. \"Did you get spicy tuna rolls?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n I kiss him on the cheek and say, \"You\u0027re the best. Did you remember to ask for tempura flakes inside?\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, I forgot. I hope they\u0027re still edible.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s joking with me because he\u0027s well aware I\u0027ll devour the spicy tuna rolls with or without the tempura crunch.\\n\\n My dad is sifting through the mail by the front door. He lives for mail. Sundays he positively goes nuts not having any. When Monday rolls around, he\u0027s like a hawk.\\n\\n I snatch the white takeout bag off the table by the front door. My mouth is already watering in anticipation of eating freshly made sushi. \"How was work?\"\\n\\n \"Hectic as usual. How was school?\"\\n\\n \"Hectic as usual.\"\\n\\n He looks sideways at me.\\n\\n \"Well, it was,\" I say. \"I had three tests, one I probably failed, two hours of homework, and I have no date for the Valentine\u0027s Dance. Top that.\"\\n\\n We walk into the kitchen together. \"Avi is in Israel,\" he says as if I\u0027m pining for a relationship that\u0027s bound to fail. Talk about the \"like father, like daughter\" syndrome.\\n\\n \"I know,\" I say.\\n\\n My dad gives me a weak smile and shrugs. \"I just don\u0027t want you to miss out.\"\\n\\n Mutt bounds into the kitchen and starts jumping on me. \"Arg!\"\\n\\n \"We have to get him fixed,\" he says.\\n\\n I sit on the kitchen floor with Mutt and pat his springy hair. \"We aren\u0027t going to do that,\" I tell my dog. \"Only mean people do that to their dogs.\"\\n\\n Mutt responds by licking my face. There\u0027s no way I\u0027m having my dog\u0027s balls cut off.\\n\\n My dad takes extra food for himself out of the refrigerator because he mistakingly treats sushi as an appetizer. He says sushi doesn\u0027t fill him up. \"Amy.\\n\\n I give him my I-am-not-backing-down stare. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"The vet said--\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, and the vet thought Mutt was a goldendoodle, too. Can you believe that? A designer mutt, no less. I don\u0027t trust that guy.\" Give me a break. My dog is a pure, unpoodleized mutt.\\n\\n My dad takes a piece of pita and swipes it into a container of hummus. It\u0027s his staple food. Israelis are to hummus as frat boys are to beer. (We\u0027ve been studying analogies in English. Can you tell?)\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t double dip,\" I warn him.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t dream of it,\" he says, stuffing the pita into his mouth.\\n\\n \"Maybe you haven\u0027t had a date in a while because you shove food into your mouth when you eat,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Maybe I haven\u0027t had a date in a while because I\u0027ve been busy,\" he says back.\\n\\n Yeah, right. \"So what kind of woman do you like?\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I can help you.\"\\n\\n \"Amy, we are not having this discussion.\"\\n\\n \"But--\"\\n\\n \"But nothing. Stop thinking about finding me a date and start concentrating on your schoolwork.\"\\n\\n I assure you schoolwork is a lot more boring. \"You know what your problem is?\" I ask him.\\n\\n \"Yes. I have a daughter who insists she knows everything.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not your problem, Aba. That\u0027s your blessing.\"\\n\\n My dad chuckles, then sets our dinner on the table.\\n\\n Taking the chopsticks from the takeout bag, I pick up a spicy tuna roll from the platter and dip it into a little container of soy sauce. I\u0027m so glad he got sushi from my favorite place. They always have the tuna without any stringy white veins attached. I do not eat sushi with stringy white veins attached. After I pop the roll into my mouth, my insides smile.\\n\\n \"I forgot to ask,\" my dad says. \"How was it at your mom\u0027s yesterday?\"\\n\\n I gauge his reaction as I say, \"She\u0027s pregnant.\"\\n\\n The poor man puts down his fork and stares at me. \"Really?\"\\n\\n I nod. I can\u0027t talk now even if I wanted to. I refuse to get emotional. \"Wow.\"\\n\\n He goes back to eating after his \"wow\" comment. I want to apologize even though it\u0027s not my fault. He\u0027s probably devastated my mom chose a dork over him. Now she\u0027s not only married to the new guy, but she\u0027s had sex with him to procreate. Eww. The thought of my mom having sex at her age is just plain gross. The fact that she\u0027s having it with my stepdad is even grosser.\\n\\n The only way to fix this situation is to find my dad a wife. Not for procreation, but so he doesn\u0027t feel like the odd one without a partner. He\u0027s for sure hiding his true feelings, covering up his devastation of losing my mom to make me feel better.\\n\\n After we finish dinner, he goes to the workout room in the building while I make a beeline for the computer.\\n\\n I\u0027m web surfing. Don\u0027t worry, I know not to give out any personal information when I\u0027m in chat rooms. My dad is a consultant for the Department of Homeland Security and has bored me to death with the dangers of the Internet until I thought my ears would bleed.\\n\\n I\u0027m not interested in chat rooms, no siree bob. I\u0027m focused purely on finding my dad a wife. Now...where can I find the perfect woman?\\n\\n I surf the Net until I finally find it. Yeah!\\n\\n Professional Jewish Singles Network.\\n\\n They guarantee you will find the Jewish mate a matchmaker would be jealous of.\\n\\n I saw Fiddler on the Roof This is the best possible news.\\n\\n My heart races as I read the home page and the requirements to join the PJSN. Need to be single. Duh! Need to be between the ages of twenty-one and seventy-five. Check. My dad is a whopping thirty-seven. Need to have a college degree. Check. My dad has a degree from the University of Illinois. Need to have a credit card to pay the $59.99 monthly fee.\\n\\n Okay, the credit card thing is going to take a little manipulation.\\n\\n My eyes dart over to the front door. His wallet is on the table where we put the mail. I know his credit card is inside.\\n\\n I saunter over to his wallet. I\u0027ve used my mom\u0027s credit card before. Of course I had permission then.\\n\\n It wouldn\u0027t hurt just to take the card out. Just to look at it. I slowly open his wallet. Yep, in one slot the top of a shiny gold credit card is staring back at me. I slip it out and glance nervously at the front door.\\n\\n I have at least thirty minutes before he comes back. After I put the wallet back on the table I trot back to the computer with his credit card in my hand. I\u0027m not thinking about how it\u0027s probably illegal that I\u0027m using someone else\u0027s card--this is about helping my father.\\n\\n The words in my head are chanting soul mate, soul mate, soul mate. My dad can\u0027t just live the rest of his life in solitary misery.\\n\\n I click the word Register. The computer prompts me to answer a list of questions. My fingers automatically type in the info.\\n\\n Name: Ron Barak Age: 37\\n\\n Hair color: dark brown\\n\\n Eye color: dark brown\\n\\n Children: one delightful seventeen-year-old\\n\\n Occupation: security consultant\\n\\n State: Illinois\\n\\n Hobbies: reading, hiking, tennis, baseball\\n\\n Okay, I\u0027m having a tough time with the hobbies question. And, to be completely honest, I\u0027ve fudged a few of the hobbies I listed. My dad doesn\u0027t know the first thing about baseball. It\u0027s not exactly a popular Israeli sport. But if you live in Chicago, you gotta be into either baseball, basketball, hockey, or football. This is a sport-centered town. I\u0027m not even going to get into the Cubs/Sox, North Side/South Side rivalry.\\n\\n On to the next question: Describe yourself in two words.\\n\\n Hmm...what two words will attract women? I type in Israeli and hunk something quick and click enter. It prompts me to scan a picture for his profile and I find one from our trip to Israel.\\n\\n Finally, it asks for my credit card number. I mean his credit card number. I punch in the numbers and before you can say \"stolen credit card, \"my dad has his own profile, PJSN e-mail, and is ready to meet his soul mate. Oh man, oh man, I am excited. My dad is in the Professional Jewish Singles Network and is ready to join the dating scene.\\n\\n Oh, shit. I hear the door opening and I still have my dad\u0027s credit card in my hot little hand. Do something quick, my mind tells me.\\n\\n I slide the credit card under the keyboard and close all of the open windows on the computer. I\u0027ll place the Visa back in his wallet later. By the time he figures out I used it, he\u0027ll be so thrilled to have met his future wife he won\u0027t get pissed off. In fact, he\u0027ll be thanking me all the way to the rabbi who\u0027ll marry them.\\n\\n \"Amy?\"\\n\\n He\u0027s onto me. He knows I took his credit card without permission. Oh, no. I swallow, hard. \"Yeah?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you think Mutt needs to go out?\" I let out a breath. \"Uh, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Well...\"\\n\\n I stand up, put the leash on Mutt, and dash to the elevator. As soon as the elevator door opens, I\u0027m pushed back by a huge cardboard box and almost fall backwards. My boobs are squished, I tell you. I probably just went from a saggy C+ cup to an A- cup.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" I yell.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" a masculine voice murmurs, then the guy puts down the box.\\n\\n But he\u0027s not a man, at least not a real one. It\u0027s the boy from yesterday who caught Mutt and gave me the concerned citizen lecture.\\n\\n Today he\u0027s wearing a green plaid shirt and jeans with a waist way too high. And I swear cranky Mr. Obermeyer has those same gym shoes.\\n\\n \"Arg!\" Mutt barks, then tries to sniff his crotch as if he\u0027s hiding a treat in there.\\n\\n Concerned Citizen covers his privates with his hands like a soccer player during a penalty kick. Then he pushes his glasses high up on his nose, the rims circling his green eyes. \"Oh, it\u0027s you.\"\\n\\n I pull Mutt away from his pants. \"Just watch where you\u0027re going next time. As a concerned citizen,\" I add, \"you should know not to crash into people with large boxes.\"\\n\\n With my rant I miss the elevator. Damn. I push the down arrow again.\\n\\n He steps forward and trips over the box. \"Are you always this friendly?\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t even answer him. Where does he come off challenging me? Thankfully the elevator dings and the door opens. I hurry inside with Mutt. There\u0027s no way I\u0027m missing my second chance at freedom. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-3.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) \\n In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
