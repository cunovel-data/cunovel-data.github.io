{"id":85748,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"1\\n\\n In conversion class, Rabbi Glassman told me that every word in the Torah is meant to be there for a reason.\\n\\n No wasted words. It makes me think about all the wasted words I\u0027ve used in my life.\\n\\n My name is Amy Nelson-Barak. My mom is a Nelson and my dad is a Barak. And no, they were never married. Being an illegitimate kid used to freak me out, but I guess this past summer when my Israeli dad took me to his homeland I got over it.\\n\\n Mom got married a few months ago to Marc \"with a c. \" He\u0027s okay, I guess, if you like the über-conservative type. They moved to the \u0027burbs after the wedding, as if marriage somehow warrants moving to a place where you have to drive a car to get to the nearest Starbucks.\\n\\n I\u0027m living with my father in Chicago. I call him Aba, which means Dad in Hebrew. He owns this cool condo in a building in Chicago on the fortieth floor. He was pretty non-existent in my life up until a few months ago. To make a long story short, this past summer my dad and I got to know each other and worked out our issues. He\u0027s learning how to be a dad to a teenage girl (me) and I\u0027m learning how to deal with an overprotective father. I\u0027ve decided to live with him until I graduate high school so I don\u0027t have to change schools. The best part about his place is it\u0027s situated directly next to a coffee shop called Perk Me Up! It\u0027s like a Starbucks, only it has better coffee.\\n\\n Okay, so I don\u0027t exactly drink coffee. I just turned seventeen in December and haven\u0027t gotten that acquired taste thing goin\u0027 on. But that\u0027s not the point. I\u0027m a city girl. And a coffee shop steps away from your front door equals city.\\n\\n I\u0027m sitting at Perk Me Up! right now, doing algebra homework on this frosty January day. Winter break ended a week ago, but I\u0027m still struggling to get into the swing of things at school. I could go upstairs and study in a quiet place, but since my dad is coming home late tonight I\u0027m vegging out here. Besides, the owner of Perk Me Up!, Maria, is super cool. She always piles the whipped cream on my hot chocolate extra high.\\n\\n Did you know whipped cream has little or no carbs? It\u0027s true. You could spray a whole can of whipped cream into your mouth all in one sitting and still have less carbs in your system than one nutritious apple. Nothing compares with extra whipped cream, unless it\u0027s a spicy tuna roll from my fave sushi restaurant, Hanabi. Okay, so I admit sushi rolls surrounded by rice aren\u0027t exactly lacking in the carb intake department. Sushi rolls are my obsession and addiction, so I give them a wide berth when it comes to counting sushi as high in carb content.\\n\\n \"Your dad working late again?\" Maria asks as she wipes off the table next to mine.\\n\\n I close my algebra book. \"Yep. I swear, it\u0027s as if the world will collapse if he misses one day.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a dedicated man,\" Maria says, a newspaper in her hand from someone who left it on a table. \"It\u0027s admirable.\"\\n\\n \"I guess.\"\\n\\n New customers walk in the door. Maria heads to the register, leaving the newspaper on my table. I notice it\u0027s open to the personals. Men seeking women. Women seeking men.\\n\\n Man, how desperate are people? I mean, who would actually need to go out and advertise for a date?\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" a familiar voice says.\\n\\n I look up at my best friend, Jessica. She\u0027s got dark hair and dark eyes, just like her parents. And her brother and sister. And her cousins. They all look like dark-haired, dark-eyed clones of each other. I swear there\u0027s not one recessive gene in her entire Jewish family tree.\\n\\n \"Me? I\u0027m not doing anything.\" I say, then shove the paper in my backpack.\\n\\n \"Amy,\" Jess says. \"I saw you reading the personals.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, you caught me.\" I show her the paper. \"Get a load of these ads, Jess. They\u0027re so...personal.\" I feel like I\u0027m peeping tomming into these people\u0027s lives.\\n\\n Jess leans in and we both read:\\n\\n Big-Hearted Taurus\\n\\n SWF, 38, 5\u002710\", lazy but likes music, dancing, casinos, dining out. Seeking SWM, 30-42, who likes lazy women for LTR.\\n\\n \"She can\u0027t be serious,\" I say.\\n\\n Jess snickers. \"Who\u0027d want a lazy gambler?\" We lean our heads together and read more:\\n\\n Professional Model\\n\\n Sexy SWF, 28, 54\", 110 lbs., blonde hair, blue eyes, enjoys trying new things and having fun. Seeking SWM, 25-65, for LTR.\\n\\n Seriously, I\u0027m confused. \"Can you please tell me what an LTR is?\"\\n\\n \"Long-term relationship.\"\\n\\n Oh. I guess I don\u0027t have the personals lingo down pat. \"Why would a skinny blonde model want a sixty-five-year-old?\" I could understand the lazy chick, but the model?\\n\\n I call Maria over to our table.\\n\\n \"Need more whipped cream, honey?\"\\n\\n \"No, thanks,\" I say. \"Why would a model advertise for an LTR in the paper?\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n Jess shakes her head. \"Long-term relationship.\" She holds out the paper to Maria.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t knock it,\" Maria says. \"I know plenty of people who\u0027ve met their soul mate online or in the personals section.\"\\n\\n Jess takes a sip of my hot chocolate. \"Amy can\u0027t understand. Avi is the perfect guy, right?\"\\n\\n I smile at the mention of my non-boyfriend, who is serving in the Israeli army. We can\u0027t really be boyfriend and girlfriend with him a billion miles away. And he\u0027s not perfect. A perfect boyfriend wouldn\u0027t be living in another country. \"What about Mitch?\" I ask Jess. \"Last week you told me God made him just for you.\"\\n\\n She makes a yuck face. \"Don\u0027t even mention his name around me.\"\\n\\n This doesn\u0027t sound promising. \"All right, what\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n Jess sighs. \"Well, he hasn\u0027t called in two days and the Valentine\u0027s Dance is right around the corner. You\u0027d think if he was going to ask me he\u0027d have done it already. My mom wants to go dress shopping but I don\u0027t even have a date.\" She\u0027s about to cry. \"And I checked my smile in the mirror this morning and realized my face is crooked.\"\\n\\n \"It is not.\"\\n\\n \"Is too. See,\" she says, smiling like she\u0027s in pain. \"The right side of my mouth droops down.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go to the dog park,\" I say, heading off a huge rampage about how bad Mitch is and how crooked her face is. Does she really think God can make everyone totally symmetrical... I mean, give the Big Guy upstairs a break. Besides, Jess has been a hypochondriac and hypercritical of herself ever since third grade when she thought she had lice but it was just bad hair spray flaking. She just needs to chill and redirect her energy into positive thoughts. \"I need to walk Mutt.\"\\n\\n Mutt\u0027s my dog. And yes, he\u0027s a mutt. Avi gave Mutt to me before I left Israel. No purebred anything in his blood. He used to be a little fur ball, but in the past two months he\u0027s tripled in size.\\n\\n Back at our condo I fetch my dog and the poop bags. Jess and her one-one-hundredth-of-an-inch crooked face is waiting for me when I walk back outside.\\n\\n \"Oh my God, he\u0027s even bigger than when I last saw him,\" she says, each breath causing puffs of steam in the winter cold.\\n\\n \"I know. If he grows any more I\u0027ll have to buy a king-size bed just to fit the both of us,\" I say, bundling my North Face jacket around me. Visitors here wonder why we Chicagoans brave the cold weather when we could be wearing shorts right now if we lived in Arizona. I\u0027ll admit Chicago winters suck if you hate cold weather. I love the cold, I love Chicago, and I love the change in seasons. I need to live in a place where in autumn the leaves actually fall off the trees.\\n\\n Jessica bites her bottom lip. \"You don\u0027t think Mitch\u0027ll be at the dog park with Zeus, do you?\"\\n\\n Yes. \"No. Jess, why don\u0027t you just ask him to the dance?\"\\n\\n \"So I can be the loser chick of the entire school?\"\\n\\n A bit of an exaggeration, dont\u0027cha think? But I don\u0027t disagree with her. Sometimes you challenge Jess, and other times you don\u0027t. This would be one of those other times.\\n\\n Besides, Mitch probably hasn\u0027t even thought about the Valentine\u0027s Day dance. It\u0027s January and the dance isn\u0027t until the middle of next month. Guys are a different breed, I tell you. I glance at Jessica, who has this pathetic, sad look on her face.\\n\\n We\u0027re walking down the street with my white, furry monstrosity practically pulling my arm out of my socket. Mutt gets über-excited just going out for a walk. But when he realizes we\u0027re going to the dog park, watch out. He\u0027s a total spaz about the dog park.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you send him to doggy boot camp or something?\" Jess says as she tries to catch up with us.\\n\\n \"He just came to this country five months ago,\" I argue. \"And he had to be quarantined. I refuse to put him in another stressful situation, the poor guy will need therapy.\"\\n\\n Jess shakes her head. \"He\u0027s a dog, Amy. You spoil him way too much.\"\\n\\n I do not.\\n\\n Okay, I do.\\n\\n But Mutt is my companion. He protects me. He makes me laugh. He\u0027s everything to me.\\n\\n We arrive at the dog park and Mutt can\u0027t contain himself. As soon as I close the gate and unlatch the leash from his collar, he romps toward his dog buddies to play.\\n\\n Mr. Obermeyer, the grumpy old man from the fourteenth floor of our building, sneers at me. \"Keep that dog of yours away from Princess.\"\\n\\n Princess is Mr. Obermeyer\u0027s champion poodle. He hates Mutt. That\u0027s just fine because I hate poodles named Princess.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, Mr. Obermeyer,\" I say. Why the old man even hangs out at the park is beyond me. He doesn\u0027t talk to anyone, except to balk and tell people to keep their dogs away from his pampered pooch.\\n\\n \"Look, there\u0027s Mitch!\" Jess whispers, then hides behind me.\\n\\n I look over at the other end of the park and see Mitch. \"Let\u0027s go talk to him.\"\\n\\n \"No! Amy, you knew he was gonna be here. Admit it.\"\\n\\n It gets to be a problem when people call you out on your passive-aggressive behavior.\\n\\n \"Jess, he\u0027s your boyfriend.\" Okay, Mitch used to be my boyfriend, but that\u0027s another story. I\u0027m not into him at all. Besides, I\u0027m content with my non-boyfriend. Well, sort of. I hate the \"non\" part of it. I wish Avi didn\u0027t have me promise not to make any formal commitment to him and vice versa.\\n\\n Jess peeks over my shoulder. \"Don\u0027t you see who he\u0027s with?\"\\n\\n I crane my neck. A flurry of red hair attached to a long-legged girl comes into view. Roxanne Jeffries.\\n\\n I hate Roxanne Jeffries almost as much as I hate dogs named Princess.\\n\\n She\u0027s smiling at Mitch. The ho. \"Jess, get your ass over there,\" I order, then move out of the way.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s smiling at her! Roxanne doesn\u0027t have crooked features, just a crooked personality. Do you think he asked her to the Valentine\u0027s Dance?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I say. \"He\u0027s your boyfriend. What\u0027s making you all insecure? You\u0027ve got gorgeous straight hair I\u0027d die for, perfect features, and perky boobs. Now go over there and claim your man.\"\\n\\n There\u0027s no way we can stay undetected. Mutt is the biggest, fluffiest, friendliest dog in the place. In fact, everyone in the neighborhood knows Mutt. And everyone in the neighborhood knows Mutt is my dog. Mitch, who thinks he\u0027s too cool to wear a jacket in twenty-five-degree weather, has already spotted my beast and waves to me.\\n\\n \"He sees me,\" I tell Jess.\\n\\n \"Shit,\" Jess mutters into my back.\\n\\n Okay, I\u0027ve had enough. \"He can\u0027t ask you if you don\u0027t talk to him.\" I start walking over to Mitch, assuming Jess will follow. \"Hi,\" I say to Mitch and Roxanne. Only now I look back and realize Jess hasn\u0027t followed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-1.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) \\n In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
