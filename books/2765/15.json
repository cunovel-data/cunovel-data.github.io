{"id":85761,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Umm... \"I\u0027m not a rule kind of person.\" \"What\u0027s his name?\" \"Ron... Ron Barak.\" My mouth opens wide as he takes a big red pen and crosses off my dad\u0027s name from the list. \"You can\u0027t do that!\" I say, totally upset now. I paid thirty-five dollars to sign my dad up for the speed dating night. Okay, to be completely honest Maria paid and I\u0027m working it off. It\u0027s a little side business arrangement I made with her. Maria takes a seat next to Larry and makes her lips all pouty. \"Is there any way you could help her out?\" The guy shrugs. \"What do you want me to do?\" Maria looks to me for an answer. \"Let me go on the dates in my dad\u0027s place.\" I admit it isn\u0027t the most brilliant idea, but it does have potential. If I could find the perfect woman for him, screen her personally... Before the guy comes to his senses, I pull a nametag and scorecard off the table. \"Women, please sit at your assigned places. Men, you\u0027ll go around to each woman, marking off either a \u0027yes\u0027 or a \u0027no\u0027 on the card. Women, you\u0027ll do the same for the men. Just write their number on your card and mark it with a yes\u0027 or \u0027no.\u0027 If you get two matching \u0027yes\u0027 marks, we\u0027ll e-mail you each other\u0027s contact information. Everyone got it?\" Nope. But I can\u0027t say anything because I\u0027ll be kicked out of this ridiculous shenanigan. Right now I\u0027m not blaming my dad. I\u0027m so nervous, as if I\u0027m going to be judged for my looks and brains and... \"Start!\" I head to the only open seat in the place. I\u0027m sitting across from a woman with the name Dru on her nametag. She looks really confused. It takes me a minute to explain myself. \"Hi, I\u0027m Amy. My dad was supposed to be here, but couldn\u0027t make it. Well, actually he didn\u0027t want to come. It\u0027s kind of a long story, but ultimately I\u0027m looking for a wife for my dad. What kinds of qualifications do you--\" \"Switch!\" Before I finish my question, I\u0027m being rushed out of the chair. I take another empty seat and find myself across from another single, confused woman. She\u0027s looking a little old to be set up with my dad, and her gray roots need to be touched up. \"How old are you?\" I ask. \"Forty.\" \"Have you tried nighttime moisturizing face cream?\" \"I beg your pardon? This is a speed dating function, not a cosmetic consultation.\" \"I know. I\u0027m trying to find a woman for my dad, but--\" Oops, the lady is raising her hand, getting the attention of the organizers. I crane my neck to find Maria deep in conversation with a guy at the other end of the bar. At least one of us is having luck tonight. \"Switch!\" Larry stands over my chair. \"Miss, you can\u0027t be here. This is a private function for adults only.\" I stand up, defeated. \"I\u0027m going, I\u0027m going,\" I say, then give a little wave to Maria and head outside. In our condo, my dad is sitting at his desk, working. \"I\u0027ll have you know I went on two three-minute dates or you. \"How were they?\" \"Terrible. You know how they say there\u0027s a pot for every lid? I think you\u0027ve got a pot in the shape of a trapezoid.\" \"Is that bad?\" he asks. To be honest, the jury\u0027s out on that one. Being unique and different is good. But I suspect there\u0027s a fine line between being unique and needing major therapy. 16 Some people will think differently of me because I\u0027m Jewish. Some people will call me names because I\u0027m Jewish. Some people will hate me because I\u0027m Jewish. Should I ignore them or confront them? Before school the next day, I spot Mitch by his locker. \"You don\u0027t break up with someone right before the Valentine\u0027s Dance,\" I tell him. \"It\u0027s rude.\" He furrows his bushy eyebrows, which at one time I thought made him look rugged and adorable. \"What do you want me to say?\" he says, then closes his locker and walks away from me. Why can girls be strong enough to confront boys with issues, but boys can\u0027t do the same? They make asinine statements and run away. I\u0027m going to make a generalized statement about boys, so brace yourself: Boys have an aversion to confrontation. (And commitment, but that\u0027s a whole different story.) But I am persistent. Catching up with Mitch, I tap him on the back and say as we\u0027re walking, \"You hurt Jessica. That wasn\u0027t cool.\" Mitch stops, but his curly hair is still bouncing up and down on his head. \"Lay off, Amy. I liked you, then I stopped liking you and fell for Jessica. Now I like someone else.\" \"Can\u0027t you commit to someone?\" \"Yeah, while I like \u0027em. When it\u0027s over, it\u0027s done. I\u0027m a teenage guy. I can afford to be picky.\" I want to slap him. While I\u0027m still contemplating his egotistic statement, he leaves me in the hallway standing amongst the student body. How many of these teens are picky? Nathan told Maria I don\u0027t like him because he wears old clothes and has glasses. That\u0027s not why. I have the sudden urge to share with Nathan why I hate him. It\u0027s not that I\u0027m picky, or rude, or think of myself as too good to be friends with him. \"Earth to Amy.\" I blink out of my daydreaming. Cami and Raine are standing in front of me, waving their arms in front of my face. \"Welcome back to reality,\" Cami says, laughing. \"What\u0027s on the menu for lunch?\" I ask, trying to forget about Mitch and what he just told me. Besides, on Mondays sometimes they surprise us with Uno\u0027s pizza. (Another high carb food, I know... but just as worth it as sushi.) \"Forget lunch. Tell us about that Nathan guy and you going to the Valentine\u0027s Dance. Everyone\u0027s talking about it, if you haven\u0027t noticed. They\u0027re saying you\u0027ve gone geek on us. First you kiss the guy in the lunchroom and then you sit at Miranda\u0027s table. What\u0027s gotten into you?\" I think about how cool Miranda was after I was rude and how quickly she took my apology without making me feel bad. She could have bitched me out, but she didn\u0027t. \"Miranda\u0027s not so bad.\" Raine puts her manicured hands up. \"She smells like Swiss cheese, Amy. You\u0027d think that big Jewish honker of hers would notice it.\" And there it is. My first time since going through conversion someone saying a derogatory remark to me about Jews. More than derogatory. Racist, really. My heart is pounding faster and I feel my throat start to constrict. I\u0027m getting a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. \"I\u0027m Jewish,\" I say, ready to defend my people even if it costs me popularity-wise. And let me tell you, being unpopular at Chicago Academy is like being a lone rabbit surrounded by a roomful of hunting dogs. Or wolves. \"Yeah, but not really. You\u0027re only half Jewish,\" Raine says, not getting it. Eww. Half. Like I can never be whole because my mom isn\u0027t Jewish? Wrong. \"Um, I gotta disagree with you there, Raine. I\u0027m all Jew. If you want to start throwing around Jewish jokes or insults, it\u0027s not gonna fly with me.\" Raine looks like she\u0027s smelling some bad cheese right about now. \"Lighten up, Amy.\" \"Don\u0027t tell me to lighten up when you insult my people,\" I say. \"I insulted Miranda Cohen, Amy. Not you. Not the entire Jewish population ox your people. Geez,\" she says, then rolls her eyes. I desperately want to walk away, to back down and remove myself from the situation like Mitch did to me. But I don\u0027t. Because I want Raine to know, or anyone else who wants to fling around Jewish insults, that it\u0027s not okay. It hurts. I can\u0027t even describe how much her words cut right through me, even though I know she doesn\u0027t realize it. My heartbeat somewhat gets back to normal when Raine turns and walks away in a huff. I turn to Cami, who\u0027s pretending to check in her book bag for something. I can tell she\u0027s just shuffling around stuff. \"I\u0027m not mad at you,\" I tell Cami. Cami looks up. \"That was intense.\" \"It wasn\u0027t meant to be.\" So now we\u0027re just standing here and I have to say something to break the silence. \"You headed for the cafeteria?\" Cami hesitates before saying, \"Nope. I have to go to the Resource Lab first. I\u0027ll meet up with you later.\" Yeah, sure. \"Whatever,\" I say, as if I don\u0027t care. Walking into the cafeteria, I survey my surroundings. Raine is already here; she\u0027s talking with a couple of other girls with their heads together in obvious gossip-mode. Did I say gossip was underrated? Well, now that I\u0027m on the other end of the Gossip Trail I\u0027m not so happy about it. Payback sucks. I\u0027m standing in line, picking out food. Yesterday was a disaster with Nathan\u0027s kiss. Now Raine is gossiping about me being Jewish. I\u0027m sure she\u0027s twisting the story around to make me look bad. I\u0027m determined to avoid drawing attention to myself. Oh, no. Nathan just walked in the room. He\u0027s about six people behind me in the cafeteria line. He\u0027s talking to Kyle. Better to know where he is so I\u0027m not given another surprise kiss without being prepared for it. Today I don\u0027t take a salad, especially because the lunchroom lady Gladys is watching me like a hawk. I order a turkey sandwich on sourdough bread, freshly made at the deli counter, and scan the lunchroom tables. Here\u0027s where life gets tricky. The lunchroom. Where the students classify and separate themselves like little granola clusters. Usually I\u0027m attached to Jessica. Wherever she sits, I sit. Right now she\u0027s at the condiment counter, squirting ketchup into a little white cup for her fries. She has no clue Raine is talking about how she made fun of Miranda\u0027s Jewish nose. Miranda is sitting with her usual cluster. They are not all Jewish. The thing they have in common is they all need fashion advice. They\u0027re also straight A students. Miranda waves over to me, and I wave back. She probably thinks I\u0027m going to sit at her table like yesterday. Jess sits in Raines cluster before I can get her attention. Looking back, Nathan is at the cashier about to pay for his two slices of pizza and bottle of Arizona Iced Tea. Okay, time to make a decision. Cluster with Jessica and Raine, where I usually sit. Or sit with Miranda and her friends again. No time to dawdle, Amy. Popular girls don\u0027t dawdle. As if I\u0027m a programmed robot, I sit with my usual friends. I feel like a traitor, although when I glance over at Miranda, she\u0027s in a heated conversation with someone else and doesn\u0027t even notice I\u0027ve chosen the popular girls who know what DKNY means, instead of her table, where they\u0027re probably discussing E\u003dMC 2 . When I take a seat next to Jessica, the table gets super quiet. Jess is confused. \"So, what\u0027s with you and the new guy Nathan?\" Roxanne asks with a snicker. \"You two put on a pretty good show yesterday. Any chance for a repeat performance?\" I take a bite of my turkey sandwich so I don\u0027t have to answer right away. I need time to think of a response, although I\u0027m usually quick-witted. Just as I\u0027m swallowing my first bite, I hear Nathan\u0027s voice behind me. \"Can I squeeze in?\" I look up at Nathan and want to say \"No\" because everyone is expecting us to start making out. Why doesn\u0027t he go sit with Kyle and his buddies? Or with the geeks at the geek table? Jessica makes everyone move down so he can sit next to me. Ugh, all eyes are on us. I do want to talk to Nathan, but in private without being surrounded and stared at by the cluster. \"So, I hear you guys are going to the Valentine\u0027s Dance,\" Roxanne says, her beady eyes focusing on my reaction. \"Are you two, like, dating?\" I feel like the entire lunchroom is listening to my response.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-15.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
