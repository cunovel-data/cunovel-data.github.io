So why can\u0027t I mix milk with chicken? You can\u0027t milk a chicken.\n \"Why do you keep glancing at the door every two seconds?\" Maria asks me the next day at work.\n Umm...maybe it\u0027s because my dad\u0027s date is gonna be here any second, followed by my dad who still doesn\u0027t know he\u0027s going on a date. He thinks Maria needs to talk to him about my work schedule. I made up some ridiculous story to get him into the café at seven o\u0027clock.\n \"I\u0027m watching for my dad,\" I tell my boss guiltily.\n The door to the café opens. It\u0027s a woman I\u0027ve never seen before. Is it Kelly, my dad\u0027s date? Or is it someone else? Kelly wrote in her e-mail that she has strawberry blonde hair. This woman kind of has strawberry blonde hair, although it\u0027s really frizzy and she needs some expensive hair products to help tame that mane of hers. That picture she posted online was with her hair straight, but maybe she forgot to flatiron it today.\n She walks up to the counter and suddenly I\u0027m feeling self-conscious, like I have to impress the woman. \"Are you Kelly?\" I ask.\n The woman shakes her Brillo pad head. \"No.\"\n \"Oh, good.\"\n When she frowns at me, I try and recover quick. \"Can I take your order?\"\n She looks up at our board of specialty coffees, taking her time. I have the urge to give her a snoring sound (I\u0027m good at those) but don\u0027t think Maria will appreciate my humor. So I wait with a smile on my face. And wait.\n And wait.\n I swear, any more of this waiting and I\u0027m going to frown. My mouth can\u0027t take all this fake smiling. I start humming, but I don\u0027t even realize it until the woman looks down at me with a stern expression. Seriously, thank goodness this woman isn\u0027t my dad\u0027s strawberry blonde date.\n The door dings. Another customer. \"Are you ready?\" I ask the woman who can\u0027t make up her mind. I could just see her as my stepmom, me waiting for her to pick me up from school, taking forever to pick out groceries, and waiting for her to order a simple spicy tuna roll from Hanabi.\n Looking around her, another woman who could pass for strawberry blonde walks up to the counter. I suck in my breath. This woman is really large. And I\u0027m being nice.\n Maybe the picture she posted was pre-weight gain. My dad is a workout and health nut, and this woman looks like she\u0027s snacked on a few too many Kit Kats if you know what I mean. She has a friendly face, though. Hey, maybe Dad can put her on a boot camp diet plan and she\u0027d lose those extra pounds in no time at all.\n Ignoring the wishy-washy lady, I ask the overweight one, \"Are you Kelly?\"\n \"No. But I\u0027d like a large caramel latte with whipped cream.\"\n I keep up the Perk Me Up! smile, although I\u0027m tempted to suggest the skim latte instead of the caramel one. While I\u0027m ringing her up, the wishy-washy lady signals to me she\u0027s ready. Can\u0027t she see I\u0027m ringing up someone else?\n Maria is in the office and I don\u0027t want her to think I can\u0027t take care of the customers. I turn to the wishy-washer. \"Did you decide?\"\n \"What\u0027s the calorie count of the medium vanilla coffee? Is it the same as the regular?\"\n Is she kidding me? I look under the counter to see if there\u0027s a calorie listing for the drinks, but there isn\u0027t. Now I don\u0027t know what to do. Should I make the other lady\u0027s drink or call Maria to help?\n I look at my watch. It\u0027s seven on the dot. Kelly will be here any second. My dad will be here any second.\n And Miss Wishy-Washy is worried about a calorie count.\n I knock on the door to the office and call Maria out to the register. I hurry to make the large caramel latte while\n Maria takes care of the frizzy-haired, high-maintenance customer. The chime rings on the door and a woman walks into the café who definitely looks like Kelly\u0027s PJSN profile pic.\n She scans the café, then sits down at a vacant table to wait for my unsuspecting dad.\n Sure enough, my dad walks in the door next. My heart is palpitating a hundred beats a second right now. My dad waves to me and walks up to the register. Kelly must recognize him from the picture I posted on his profile. She moves up behind him and is about to tap him on the shoulder.\n \"I have to tell you something,\" I say at the same time Kelly taps him and says, \"Ron?\"\n He turns to her. \"Can I help you?\"\n \"Dad, it\u0027s important.\"\n He puts his fingertips together on one hand and moves it up and down, the unique Israeli sign for wait a second. The problem is, I can\u0027t wait a second. I need to tell him that, even though he\u0027s unaware of it, he\u0027s on his first PJSN date.\n \"I\u0027m Kelly. Are you Ron?\" Kelly asks.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"From the Professional Jewish Singles Network?\" Pause.\n \"Um...could you hold that thought for one second,\" my dad says to Kelly. Then he turns to me. \"Tell me what this is all about, Amy. Right. Now. I\u0027m assuming Maria doesn\u0027t want to talk to me about adjusting your work schedule.\"\n \"Aba, you\u0027re going to laugh when I tell you this.\"\n \"I doubt it.\"\n Kelly looks upset and embarrassed. \"Am I missing something here?\"\n Okay, it\u0027s time to fess up. I thought it\u0027d be easier than it is. I have the urge to hide in a dark corner. \"I set up the date. I\u0027m his daughter,\" I tell her.\n Getting it, Kelly steps back. \"Oh.\" She adjusts the Coach bag hanging on her shoulder. \"Well, that makes me look stupid.\"\n \"Actually, it makes me look stupid,\" I tell her.\n \"And me,\" my dad chimes in. \"I\u0027ll tell you what, Kelly. Why don\u0027t we sit down and have my daughter serve us the most expensive drinks in the place. It\u0027ll be her treat.\"\n Kelly shrugs and nods her head in agreement. \"Sounds good to me.\"\n It doesn\u0027t sound good to me at all!\n \"I\u0027m hungry, actually. How about one of the scones?\" my dad asks. I\u0027m adding the bill in my head, knowing I\u0027ll have to work at least two more hours in order to pay for the food bill.\n \"Scones sound wonderful,\" Kelly says, smiling. \"Don\u0027t they have Eli\u0027s cheesecake, too? Grab me a slice of that, would you, dear?\"\n I\u0027m not liking Kelly with the strawberry blonde hair as much as my dad seems to like her. Teaching me a lesson is not how I imagined this date going. My dad sits down with Kelly while I bring them over Double Dutch Coffee Delight drinks. (I add a couple extra shots of espresso as a bonus...I hope they both are up all night and can\u0027t sleep.) Those specialty drinks are four dollars and twenty-five cents each, along with the two-dollar-and-fifty-five-cent cheesecake and two-dollar-and-thirty-five-cent scones.\n As if my day isn\u0027t disastrous enough, when Maria tells me to sweep the floor of the café I find Nathan at his usual spot in the corner. \"You got caught in one of your lies, Barbie?\" Nathan says. \"I have a piece of advice. Next time you set your dad up on a date, you should probably tell him about it beforehand.\"\n I shoot him a nasty glare. \"At least I have parents,\" I say, then want to take back my words right after they\u0027ve left my mouth. Nathan\u0027s face goes ashen and he starts packing up his stuff.\n Maybe his parents are dead or in the hospital somewhere. I\u0027m a jerk. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I quickly say.\n As he shoves the last book into his backpack, he looks up at me. \"No you\u0027re not.\" Then he leaves me standing here while he storms out of the café, leaving me to pick up his used cup which is still three-quarters of the way full with tea. Now I\u0027m feeling even worse than before.\n I glance over at my dad, who\u0027s shaking hands with Kelly. She exits the café, leaving my dad alone at the table until I saunter up to him and say, \"So?\"\n He looks up at me from his chair. \"So what?\"\n \"How was the date?\"\n \"Fine.\"\n Fine is probably the most non-committal and non-descriptive word in the English language. I hate the word fine. It doesn\u0027t even mean anything. I try a different approach, one that can\u0027t be answered with a \"fine.\"\n \"Are you gonna see her again?\"\n \"Maybe.\"\n Great, another non-descriptive word. \"Did you get her number?\"\n My dad stands now, which is not a good thing because he\u0027s way taller than me. \"Listen to me, Amy, and listen good. Don\u0027t set me up on another date without my knowledge or you\u0027ll find yourself without a cell phone. Got it?\"\n \"Fine.\"\n 10\n Rosh Hashanah: Two nights of huge festive meals. Hanukkah: Eat foods cooked in oil. Passover: The Haggadah (Passover prayer book) specifically says, Eat The Festive Meal. Sukkot: Build a sukkah and invite friends to eat in it. Yom Kippur: Eat three meals at once to make up for the day just fasted. I see a pattern here. Why are so many Jewish holidays centered around food?\n Since my dad went out of town this morning, Jessica invited me over for Shabbat dinner. So after school I go home, walk Mutt, then take a cab to Jessica\u0027s. I might also add that Nathan ignored me the entire day. Even when I tried to apologize again, he turned around and blatantly dissed me.\n \"Come in, Amy,\" Jessica\u0027s mom says when she opens the door to their six-flat. \"Jessica is in her room.\"\n I climb the familiar whitewashed staircase and catch Jessica sitting at her desk, punching the keyboard of her computer. \"You\u0027re not checking Mitch\u0027s e-mail again, are your\n Without looking at me she responds, \"You bet I am.\n He has no clue. I check them all and mark them as \u0027unread\u0027 e-mail.\"\n \"Jess, break up with him if you don\u0027t trust him.\"\n Jess swivels her chair around to face me. \"He told me he loved me on New Year\u0027s Eve, Amy. I haven\u0027t had a guy tell me he loved me since That Guy.\"\n That Guy is Michael Greenberg, who Jessica lost her virginity to last year. He blew her off right after their big night together and she\u0027s been insecure about guys ever since. She won\u0027t even give me, her bestest friend in the entire world, details about what happened with Michael. I can\u0027t even say his name without her walking out of the room.\n \"Did he tell you he loved you in the heat of passion?\"\n \"His hands were under my shirt.\"\n Okay, so I\u0027m not going to state the obvious. He gave her the of \"I love you, let\u0027s get it on\" crap. I look back at her and know she doesn\u0027t want to talk about it anymore.\n I look inside Jessica\u0027s closet to see what new clothes she\u0027s gotten that I can borrow. I pick out a vintage gray shirt with pink writing. \"Where did you get this?\"\n \"I have no clue. My mom got it for me.\"\n \"It\u0027s cool.\" As always, I make myself at home. Best friends share clothes, secrets, and beauty tips. I guess we also share guys because I dated Mitch for about a millisecond before he started dating Jessica. Taking my own shirt off, I try on her gray one. It fits, except when I look in her long mirror on the back of her door my nipples stick out because the fabric of the shirt is too thin.\n Depressed, I pull the shirt off and study my bra-covered boobs in the mirror.\n \"What are you doing?\" Jess asks.\n I hold my arms at my sides and look down at my pink lacy bra. \"Do my boobs sag in this bra?\" Testing what it would look like if they were perkier, I cup the bottom of my boobs and lift them up. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-8.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: \n How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) \n In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
