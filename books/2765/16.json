{"id":85762,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\"Oh, yeah,\" I say. \"Didn\u0027t you know? It was love at first sight. Right, Nathan?\"\\n\\n It\u0027s either going to be me and Nathan against Roxanne and the rest of the bunch, or me against everyone.\\n\\n I turn my head and look at Nathan, sitting beside me. The fluorescent lights of the cafeteria are reflected in his glasses, so I can\u0027t see his eyes. But those circular frames are definitely directed at me. \"Yeah, right,\" he says. \"I guess it\u0027s true. Opposites attract.\"\\n\\n I chow on another bite of my sandwich, staring down at my food so I don\u0027t have to talk.\\n\\n But I do see Nathan\u0027s fingers, reaching for his pizza. Within three minutes he\u0027s picking up the second piece. It\u0027s probably a world record in pizza eating. By the time he\u0027s done with his second slice, students are still entering the cafeteria.\\n\\n One gulp of iced tea and he\u0027s done. I\u0027m still trying to choke down my sandwich.\\n\\n Nathan murmurs something to me in my ear that I can\u0027t understand, and leaves.\\n\\n \"What did he say?\" Jess asks, obviously confused. She knows Nathan and I aren\u0027t even friends. Okay, we did kiss. But it was for show. I wasn\u0027t even a willing participant the second time.\\n\\n \"No idea,\" I mumble, then take another bite.\\n\\n After school, Jess catches up to me on the way to the bus stop.\\n\\n \"Amy,\" she says. \"I don\u0027t get it. You think Nathan is a dork--don\u0027t even argue with me because I know you better than your own mom does. Then you kiss him in front of the entire school while you\u0027re still hung up on Avi. Raine is telling everyone you\u0027ve gone wacko on her. It doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\\n\\n \"Life doesn\u0027t make sense, Jess. Do you hate me?\"\\n\\n \"Why would I hate you? I may not understand you. I may get mad at you. But I could never hate you.\"\\n\\n Nathan is walking toward us, his uptight gait is so dorky I want to wince. I swear the guy needs a lesson in loosening up and being crazy. He probably dances like a sixty-year-old.\\n\\n Avi is an amazing dancer. I remember in Israel last summer he was dancing with a girl and I got jealous so I picked a guy at random and pulled him out on the dance floor. Biggest mistake. Let\u0027s just say the end result almost had me arrested by the Israeli police.\\n\\n When Nathan reaches us, Jessica walks to the bus stop to give us privacy. She\u0027s such a good friend. Totally mistaken about the situation between me and Nathan, but her heart is in the right place.\\n\\n I tap Nathan on his elbow. \"We need to talk.\"\\n\\n \"Why? You want to kiss again?\"\\n\\n \"And have your glasses whack me in the face again? I don\u0027t think so. I want to talk. The kind of talking where lips don\u0027t touch.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry. No can do.\"\\n\\n The bus is turning the corner. \"Well, we can\u0027t keep pretending to be dating.\"\\n\\n \"Sure we can,\" he says, putting his arm around me and leading me to the back so we sit with everyone else. I shrug his arm off.\\n\\n When we get to our stop, we climb off the bus and he puts his arm around my shoulders again as if we\u0027re a real couple. Before I can shrug him off again, I look up. My heart slams into my chest and I almost fall backward.\\n\\n Standing at the front of my building, like an Abercrombie model posing without even meaning to, is Avi.\\n\\n And he\u0027s watching me walk toward him with Nathan\u0027s arm around me. I\u0027m too shocked to ask Avi how he got here, why he\u0027s here, how long he\u0027s going to stay, or if he still cares about me.\\n\\n \"Avi,\" I say softly when we get closer to him. I swear I\u0027m still in a trance when I add, \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s this guy?\" he answers back.\\n\\n 17\\n\\n If God made the world in six days (Genesis 2:2), surely I can make sense of my life in seven.\\n\\n I shrug Nathan\u0027s arm off me. He drops it from my shoulders, but still stands next to me. What, is Nathan waiting for a formal introduction? I\u0027m not prepared to give it, even when I find myself saying, \"Avi, this is Nathan. Nathan, this is my... this is Avi.\"\\n\\n It was a big deal to Avi that we didn\u0027t label ourselves boyfriend and girlfriend, with him in the Israeli army for the next three years. As much as my mind agreed with it, my heart didn\u0027t. My ego didn\u0027t, either. So I end up telling everyone he\u0027s my non-boyfriend. Let them decide what it means.\\n\\n I look at Avi; his stance is stiff and his jaw is tight. He\u0027s always been guarded and tough, and I can feel he\u0027s already putting up an invisible thick wall between us, ready to shut me out. And he\u0027s been with me less than two minutes.\\n\\n Which actually pisses me off because he was the one who didn\u0027t want to be official boyfriend and girlfriend. I did.\\n\\n I watch as Avi reaches out to shake Nathan\u0027s hand. They\u0027re so opposite. Avi is the model type and Nathan is this ail-American boy-next-door (who needs a major makeover). They give one hard \"shake and release\" with their hands.\\n\\n \"I got time off,\" Avi says. \"For a week. Surprise, surprise.\"\\n\\n A week. I have a week with him. A part of me is giddy beyond belief that I\u0027ll have seven days to spend with him and the other half is mad because it\u0027s just a tease. Just when I\u0027m ready to move on in my life, he shows up and messes it all back up.\\n\\n Nathan is still standing beside me, watching me with those stupid emerald eyes. \"Catch you later, Amy,\" he says, then opens the door to our building.\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t call me Barbie. Why that fact should stick in my brain is beyond me.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you have a suitcase?\" I ask Avi.\\n\\n \"I left my duffle with the security guy inside.\" He puts his hands in his jeans pockets and looks away from me. \"This was a bad idea, Amy. I thought... well, screw what I thought. I have a friend at Northwestern I can stay with.\"\\n\\n A gust of Chicago wind rushes through the street and chills me to the bone. \"You shouldn\u0027t have surprised me. I hate surprises. Although I probably should have told you that a long time ago. But now that you know, don\u0027t do it again.\"\\n\\n Avi\u0027s eyebrow quirks up. \"I told your dad,\" he says. His voice is smooth and reminds me of dark chocolate milk.\\n\\n \"Great. My dad knows more about my boyf--about you than I do.\"\\n\\n All, it all makes sense now, why my dad asked me how I felt about Avi when we had our manicures.\\n\\n \"I thought you\u0027d want me to come.\"\\n\\n \"I do, Avi,\" I say, but I can tell by the way he\u0027s standing stiff he doesn\u0027t believe me.\\n\\n Right now is the awkward stage. I mean, really, we haven\u0027t even touched or hugged or really, really looked at each other yet. I can tell him how much I\u0027ve missed him until I\u0027m blue in the face, though I\u0027m already blue in the face because I\u0027m freezing my ass off out here.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s talk up in my condo, okay?\"\\n\\n He nods and follows my lead. The doorman gives Avi his huge, army green duffle as we pass.\\n\\n In the elevator, Avi looks straight ahead while I stand behind him. I can\u0027t believe he\u0027s actually here, in America, in Chicago, in my elevator!\\n\\n I have so many questions running through my head, number one being why is he here? I thought he\u0027d be in training until February.\\n\\n Glancing at him, I analyze the differences a few months can make. Wow, he looks taller and more muscular than he did last summer--he\u0027s obviously been working out. And I swear he\u0027s standing straighter and has a determined look to him that I don\u0027t remember. Raw confidence. A commando in the making.\\n\\n Although there\u0027s a caged animal energy radiating from him, as though being in an elevator is making him claustrophobic.\\n\\n The door to the elevator opens and I lead him to my condo. Mutt greets us with energetic \"Args!\" and a tail wagging so hard I think it\u0027ll fall off if he gets any more excited.\\n\\n Avi\u0027s eyes go wide. \"He\u0027s gadol... big,\" he says in Hebrew and English as he leans over to pet Mutt. When Mutt goes for his crotch, Avi says in a calm, deep voice, \"Die!\u0027\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not nice to say to my dog,\" I say. Maybe Avi\u0027s not the guy I once thought he was. Telling my dog to die is not my idea of being cool.\\n\\n Avi stands up tall. \"Die means \u0027stop\u0027 in Hebrew, Amy. As in \u0027that\u0027s enough; I don\u0027t want your nose in my balls.\u0027 That okay with you?\"\\n\\n Oh, no. Things are not going well at all. \"Yeah,\" I say sheepishly. \"That\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n Mutt scratches the door and noses the leash. I wish Mutt would wait, but if you gotta go, you gotta go no matter if you\u0027re human or animal.\\n\\n \"I need to take him out or he\u0027ll pee on the floor,\" I say.\\n\\n Avi drops his duffle and says, \"I\u0027ll go with you.\"\\n\\n The problem is we need to talk honestly and openly (at the dog park that\u0027s not going to happen). I don\u0027t want to alienate Avi more than I already have. \"That\u0027s okay. It\u0027ll just take me a minute. I mean, it\u0027ll just take Mutt a minute. Wait here, okay?\" He nods. \"Fine.\"\\n\\n I hurry and clip Mutt\u0027s leash to his collar. In the elevator, Mutt looks up at me with his puppy dog eyes that are so expressive sometimes I think there\u0027s a human soul inside all of that fur. \"Avi\u0027s here,\" I tell him. \"And its awkward. What can I do to make it all better?\"\\n\\n Mutt looks up at me, sticks his tongue out, and pants like a...like a dog who wants to pee.\\n\\n No answers from this genius dog.\\n\\n At the dog park, I unclip the leash when we\u0027re fenced inside the park. My mind isn\u0027t on Mutt. It\u0027s on Avi. I contemplate what I\u0027m going to say to him when I get back upstairs.\\n\\n Do I tell him I kissed Nathan... twice?\\n\\n It didn\u0027t mean anything, and yet I did participate. But how much participating do you have to do before it can really be labeled cheating?\\n\\n Although how can I cheat on someone who I\u0027m not even officially dating? Does the label of \"dating\" matter, or is it the feelings in your heart that takes precedence? Oh, man, I am so screwed up. Can my life get any worse?\\n\\n As if on cue, I hear screaming and a ruckus coming from the other end of the dog park. I turn around and my eyes go wide when I see Mutt humping another dog.\\n\\n He\u0027s usually humping another male dog, showing him who\u0027s the boss.\\n\\n But not this time.\\n\\n My mutt Mutt is humping Princess. Mr. Obermeyer\u0027s prized purebread Princess.\\n\\n And he is going at it but good. Oh, shit.\\n\\n When I run over, Mr. Obermeyer is screaming at me, \"Get your dog off her!\"\\n\\n I swallow, hard. \"What...what do you want me to do?\"\\n\\n In a state of panic, I catch Mitch watching the whole obscene scene and laughing. Most of the other people have their mouths wide open in horror because everyone knows to keep their dog away from Princess and Mr. Obermeyer.\\n\\n I start yelling words to make Mutt leave Princess alone. \"Mutt, come! Treat! No! Get off! Leave her alone! DIE!\" Yeah, even that last word Avi just taught me didn\u0027t work.\\n\\n Now all I want to do is DIE.\\n\\n \"Do something, besides give commands your dog doesn\u0027t follow,\" Mr. Obermeyer yells. \"Hurry!\"\\n\\n I take a step toward the two dogs in a romantic dance. \"Get off Princess,\" I growl through clenched teeth. \"She\u0027s not your type.\"\\n\\n Mutt obviously has selective hearing.\\n\\n When I move closer, I\u0027m getting queasy. I\u0027m not an all-natural-comfortable-in-nature kind of person. Interrupting two dogs in the middle of a very private moment in a very public setting is not my thing and never will be.\\n\\n Taking a deep breath and bracing myself for humiliation, I step behind Mutt and wrap my arms across his middle. And pull. And pull. But Mutt refuses to let go. Damn.\\n\\n As soon as I release my grip and give up, Mutt bounds away from Princess as if the entire thing was no big deal. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-16.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) \\n In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
