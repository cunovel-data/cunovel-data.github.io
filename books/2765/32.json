I know this because although my dad came home an hour later and I ran to my room and pretended to be fast asleep, those cameras would have caught Avi and I in some very compromising positions despite our attempt to keep the covers over us.\n Oh, don\u0027t get all worried...I\u0027m still a pure seventeen-year-old. I\u0027m just...well...more knowledgeable about certain things. (Things I\u0027m more curious about now than I ever was.)\n In the morning, Tarik picked up Avi and drove us all to the airport. I was crying the entire time, although I tried to keep it together. Our goodbye kiss held more promise than last time, although we both know we have to go on and live our lives. Don\u0027t ask, don\u0027t tell. We\u0027re going to take it one day at a time and see what happens. Hopefully this summer when I go to Israel it\u0027ll be the same as last night...well, without the fighting.\n I purposely didn\u0027t bring up Jessica to Tarik, although now Tarik and I are sitting at Perk Me Up! and Jess could walk in at any time.\n Maria brings me hot chocolate with the whipped cream overflowing because she knows how upset I am. Do you think my bloodshot, teary eyes give my upsetness away? Maria hugs me, a warm hug my mom would give me if she were here.\n An idea pops into my head. I can\u0027t believe I hadn\u0027t thought of it before. \"Maria, what do you think of my dad? You know, if he smiled more and got a good haircut?\"\n Maria laughs and walks back to the register, ignoring my question. I think I saw her blush a little, though. My dad loves her coffee; he never drinks it anywhere else. In fact, I think he got me this job just so he could see her more and have an excuse to hang out at Perk Me Up! Hmm...\n The door to Perk Me Up! opens and guess who walks in...yep, Jess. Along with Miranda and a very sad Nathan. Poor Nathan. Poor Jess.\n It\u0027s time I stop making a mess of my own life and focus on everyone else. I can do it. There\u0027s nothing that says I have to be a Disaster Girl all the time. I can live a squeaky-clean life while helping others un-screwup their lives. No more getting in trouble for Amy Nelson-Barak.\n My cell phone is ringing. It\u0027s my dad. \"Hey, Aba, what\u0027s up?\"\n \"What\u0027s up? Please tell me what a pair of plastic handcuffs are doing in the back seat of my car.\" Oops. Everything is so not sababa. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-32.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: \n How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) \n In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
