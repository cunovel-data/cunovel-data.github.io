{"id":85760,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\"Oh, you\u0027re so sweet, Maria,\" I say, then hug her. Nathan points to me. \"She thinks I\u0027m a dork because I wear old clothes and have glasses.\" \"Well, he thinks I\u0027m a bitch because I say out loud what everyone else is thinking.\" \"You know what I think?\" Maria says, stepping closer to the counter. Nathan and I say, \"What?\" in unison. \"I think you two like each other.\" I roll my eyes while Nathan does a shiver as if the thought of liking me grosses him out. \"Nope,\" he says. \"Not at all\" I say. \"Besides, I have Avi. And he\u0027s got Bucky.\" \"Bicky.\" \"Whatever.\" \"Yep,\" Maria says, then saunters to the supply room like she knows what\u0027s going on. \"You guys definitely like each other.\" Nathan starts to laugh. \"It\u0027s not funny,\" I say. More customers come into the caf√©, so it\u0027s my chance to say to Nathan, \"Please order or step aside so I can wait on someone else.\" \"I\u0027ll have a medium green tea with ice, no sweetener,\" he says, diverting my attention back to him. Figures he\u0027d order something so plain. After I take his money and turn around to make his boring drink, Nathan says so only I can hear, \"Don\u0027t spit in it.\" As if I would. Puh leaze. I hand his drink to him and focus my attention on the other customers. The hour goes by fast. Making drinks, cleaning off the tables, and ignoring Nathan typing away in the computer corner is exhausting, though. I sigh in relief when my dad walks through the door to pick me up. My dad has already changed clothes from work. He\u0027s wearing dark jeans and a black long-sleeve tee. I\u0027ve convinced him to grow his hair out a bit, so he resembles a cuter and cooler dad but he\u0027s still got about two months to go before he can get a good style going. \"Hey, Aba,\" I greet him. Out of the corner of my eye I swear I see Nathan watching us. \"How was school today?\" my dad asks. I look over at Nathan. Now he\u0027s pretending to read the computer screen, but I know he\u0027s not reading a damn thing. He\u0027s wondering if I\u0027ll tell my dad what happened in the cafeteria. \"Nothing much. What about you?\" My dad kisses the top of my head. \"Just preparing for a presentation in D.C. You ready to go?\" \"Yep.\" \"Great. where to?\" I grab my dad\u0027s elbow and journey into the cold outside air. \"Follow me,\" I say, leading him down State Street. I lean into my dad to try and soak up some of the warmth of his strong commando arm. \"I\u0027m sorry I yelled at you yesterday,\" I say. \"I just want you to be happy.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, too. You didn\u0027t make any more dates for me, did you?\" \"Here we are,\" I tell him as we turn down artsy Oak Street with the designer shops and upscale salons. I pull him into the first building we come to, a place called Sheer-Ahz. I purposely leave out the speed-dating thing I signed him up for at the last minute. \"You\u0027re getting a haircut?\" he asks when he realizes Sheer-Ahz is a salon. \"Nope.\" He halts his steps abruptly. \"Then why the salon?\" I look up at him and smile widely as if he was a customer at Perk Me Up! \"We\u0027re getting manicures.\" \"You mean you\u0027re getting a manicure.\" \"Nope. You heard me right the first time, Aba.\" \"Men don\u0027t get manicures.\" \"Come, on. Haven\u0027t you heard of metrosexual men?\" My dad shakes his head. \"No. And I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t want to be one.\" \"Didn\u0027t you say I could pick what we do tonight?\" \"Yes, but--\" I turn to my dad, one of the few people who takes my crap and loves me despite it. Maybe even more because of it. My dad pretends he\u0027s not afraid of anything, but I\u0027ve just uncovered his weakness... getting his nails trimmed and shaped. Give me a break. \"This is what I want to do. My nails are all dry and cracked. Think of it as daddy/ daughter bonding time.\" \"Can\u0027t we bond by playing indoor soccer or something like that?\" he says. \"I don\u0027t do soccer. I do manicures.\" I pull all six feet of him up to the front desk. \"We have appointments for two manicures,\" I inform the lady. \"For Amy and Ron Barak.\" She doesn\u0027t flinch as she punches our names in the computer, writes something on two tickets, and hands them to us. \"Feel free to have refreshments in the meditation room while you\u0027re waiting.\" My dad turns to me and says, \"Did she just say meditation room?\" in his deep, manly voice. I swear he\u0027s making it sound deeper than usual. Once inside the white silk-draped room with scented candles and soft music, he looks nervous. I don\u0027t think a retired Israeli commando has ever been in a place like this. He\u0027d probably look more at home in the desert. Or in a war zone. There are no other guys in the room, just a lady in a terry cloth robe. I bet she\u0027s got nothing on underneath. She\u0027s reading one of the complimentary magazines and doesn\u0027t pay any attention to us. \"Sit down,\" I tell my dad while I sink into the plushy, soft, cream-colored chair and breathe to the rhythm of the slow music. \"I\u0027d rather stand,\" he says tersely. My eyes close as my mind drifts. \"Suit yourself.\" After a few minutes, two women dressed in long, white coats call out, \"Ron and Amy Barak.\" \"That\u0027s us,\" he says, then clasps his hands together and rubs them back and forth. The sound is making me cringe and everyone is staring at him. Real smooth, Dad. When we\u0027re sitting down next to each other, the nail technician takes my dad\u0027s hand and places it in a small container of soapy water. \"I don\u0027t want a color,\" he tells the woman right away. I want to groan. Does he honestly think they\u0027re going to make his nails a brilliant red or fuchsia pink? \"Aba, guys get clear. Or just a buff.\" Duh. \"Oh. Okay...I think.\" Seriously, take a guy out of his element and he gets all confused and insecure. My own nail technician, Sue, is expertly massaging my wrists, palms, and hands as they turn to Jell-O under her skilled touch. \"My daughter made me come here,\" my dad tells the women, but he says it loud enough so everyone in the small salon can hear him. Go, manly man! Yes, tell all women you a strong warrior man. Spare me. \"Aba, you\u0027ve got calluses and your skin is all dry and cracked. I swear you look like a dinosaur. Right, Sue? Just look at his paws.\" Sue is extremely non-committal as she glances at my dad\u0027s hands. She smiles sweetly at him, then continues to work magic with my fingers. I can tell when my dad\u0027s nail tech starts his own hand massage. His shoulders, for the first time since we got here, slump into relaxation mode. His hair has curled from the dampness in the air, making him look younger and vulnerable. I wonder if he was ever insecure. As a teen did he go through an awkward stage or was he hard and manly and confident since the day he was born? My dad looks Middle Eastern with his dark olive complexion, dark features, and strong chiseled nose. If he was a stranger, I wouldn\u0027t immediately think he was Jewish, though. I wonder if he ever wanted to be something other than what he is. Because I never thought I\u0027d want to be any religion, but now I feel different. Being Jewish isn\u0027t a choice; it\u0027s a part of me. A part I just discovered, but it\u0027s significant in any case. \"After I convert I want a bat mitzvah,\" I tell my dad, bringing him to attention. \"With a big party?\" he asks. Thinking about it more, I decide I don\u0027t want a big shindig. \"I\u0027d just like Jessica and a few other friends to come over afterward. And Mom and Marc. You know, if it\u0027s okay with you.\" \"It\u0027s fine. In fact, it\u0027s great.\" He\u0027s watching intently as his cuticles are cut and fortified and his nails are shaped. I think he\u0027s enjoying it as much as I am, but I\u0027m not sure if my \"manly man\" dad will admit it. I pick a French manicure while he picks out a sheer, almost invisible bottle of polish. When we\u0027re done, the nail techs lead us into the drying area and instruct us to place our wet nails under ultraviolet lights to get them to dry fast. I put my hands under the lights while my dad picks up his ultra-violet light machine and examines it. \"Put that down before you get us in trouble,\" I whisper. \"Before I stick my hands under something, I\u0027d like to know exactly what it is. Don\u0027t be so trusting, Amy,\" he advises, going into Homeland Security mode. I chuckle. \"Yeah, the nail technicians are the enemy. Be afraid. Be very afraid.\" He puts the machine down but still doesn\u0027t stick his hands underneath the fluorescent blue light. \"Let\u0027s talk about Avi,\" he says, still refusing to put his hands under the light. \"Why?\" He shrugs. \"I just want to know if you\u0027re still an item.\" \"Dad, the word \u0027item\u0027 went out in the seventies but yes, I still like him. I mean, we haven\u0027t been able to see each other but I\u0027m hoping in the summer when we go back to Israel he\u0027ll get time off.\" I take a sideways look at my dad. \"You know he\u0027s my non-boyfriend, right?\" \"What exactly does that mean?\" he asks. \"I\u0027ve heard you and Jessica using the phrase, but I don\u0027t get it.\" I check my nails to see if they\u0027re still tacky and need more ultra-violet rays but they\u0027re as dry as my stepdad\u0027s liquor cabinet. I hop off the stool I\u0027ve been sitting on, trying to explain the relationship label Avi wanted. \"It means we can see other people because we obviously can\u0027t physically be together. There\u0027s no commitment. We\u0027re casual, great friends. Get it?\" He nods. \"Got it.\" \"Speaking of casual friends, I have a surprise for you.\" \"It\u0027s not another online date, is it?\" \"Oh, no,\" I say, shaking my head vigorously. \"It\u0027s a bunch of dates. Tonight. Speed dating at the Blues Bar on Chicago Avenue and you have to be there in fifteen minutes. Don\u0027t worry about impressing anyone. You only have three minutes for each date. It\u0027s all about making a connection.\" 15 Israel is tiny, yet everyone fights over it. I guess it\u0027s true that the biggest and best things come in small packages. My manipulation skills obviously need help, because my dad refused to even step one foot inside the bar for the speed dating night. Standing in front of the bar, I wait until the bouncer is preoccupied and slink inside without him noticing. \"He\u0027s not coming?\" Maria is there, wearing a black scooped-neck dress. She got so excited when I told her about the speed dating she decided to sign up, too. She and my dad aren\u0027t compatible. She\u0027s into mushy romantic guys and my dad is...well, he\u0027s not. He\u0027s Israeli. I walk up to the guy running the program, a balding guy with a ring of red hair around his scalp. He\u0027s got a nametag on his chest with the word LARRY in big black letters. \"My dad couldn\u0027t make it,\" I tell Larry, looking over his notes. The bar is crowded. I refuse to cancel my dad\u0027s reservation to date twenty women in an hour and a half. Larry looks up at me. \"Your dad?\" \"Yeah, I kind of signed him up.\" \"You can\u0027t do that. Did you read the rules?\" The guy doesn\u0027t even question what a seventeen-year-old is doing in a bar in the first place.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-14.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
