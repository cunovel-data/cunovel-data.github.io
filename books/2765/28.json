If you want to get technical about it, I did ditch them tonight.\\n\\n 29\\n\\n Sarah gave birth to Isaac when she was ninety years old and her husband, Abraham, was one hundred years old (Genesis 17:17). I hope my mom and Marc aren\u0027t going to keep having kids until they\u0027re that old.\\n\\n I love weekends. Especially when I don\u0027t have any homework and my boyfriend is in town.\\n\\n In the morning, I walk out of my bedroom wearing a black, extra-small wrap shirt that shows off way too much cleavage. Jess and I both bought one last winter when they were the hottest fashion, but we were too embarrassed to wear them in public.\\n\\n During breakfast, I make a big production out of bending down to pour Avi cereal. He\u0027s not looking; every time I check his eyes are focused on his food. I keep bringing him stuff...bread, hummus, orange juice. He looks at my face, but definitely not my cleavage. What\u0027s up with that?\\n\\n When my dad walks into the kitchen, he takes one look at me and slaps his hands over his eyes. \"Amy, where\u0027s the rest of your shirt?\"\\n\\n \"This is it.\"\\n\\n \"Um... no. No. No. No. It doesn\u0027t cover your... parts.\" He points to Avi. \"Close your eyes.\" He shakes the same finger at me, but still has one hand over his eyes. \"Go back in your room and put on something VERY conservative. That covers those girl things.\"\\n\\n Avi\u0027s shoulders are shaking and I think he just spit out his cereal from trying to cover up his laughter.\\n\\n I huff in frustration and look at my boyfriend. \"Did you not notice my boobs practically hanging out?\"\\n\\n Avi looks from me to my dad. \"Um...is this a talk we should be having in front of your aba!\"\\n\\n My dad holds up his hands, stopping the conversation. \"This is a conversation that should not be happening at all. Amy, I\u0027m calling your mom. After you change your shirt. This is out of my jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n I change, then have to deal with my mom and dad talking on the phone about me for fifteen minutes.\\n\\n \"I noticed them, Amy,\" Avi says as I plunk myself back down at the kitchen table.\\n\\n \"Well, you weren\u0027t staring at \u0027em,\" I say accusingly.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know you wanted me to.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s got me there. Usually I hate people staring at my over-abundance of frontage that God \"blessed me with\" (my mom\u0027s phrase, not mine). Avi knows this. I know I\u0027m being ridiculous and not making any sense.\\n\\n \"If it makes you feel any better, when you turned away I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off them.\"\\n\\n Even though I know this entire conversation is ridiculous, I say, \"Thank you, Avi.\"\\n\\n He gives me one of his signature half-smiles. \"It\u0027s all sababa.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I say. \"It is.\"\\n\\n After my mom has a \"talk\" with me over the phone about private parts remaining private, I drag Avi to the Museum of Science and Industry. It\u0027s my favorite museum, especially the dead baby exhibit. Okay, so technically it\u0027s called the neonatal exhibit, showcasing embryos and fetuses in formaldehyde. I\u0027ve always been fascinated with the exhibit: seeing how human life starts as a speck and ends up a real person. Total miracle, I can\u0027t describe it any other way.\\n\\n Makes you believe in God all over again.\\n\\n I thought Avi would be bored looking at the dead babies, but when I glance over at him and catch him riveted to the exhibit I know he feels the same way about it that I do. As I study the stages of development, my heart goes out to the mothers of these children who weren\u0027t able to grow up. They lost their lives before life even started. But they\u0027re doing more for people than most do in a lifetime, surely more than I\u0027ve done in my seventeen years. They\u0027ve made people more educated, they\u0027ve made people aware of what it\u0027s like inside of a woman\u0027s body as she\u0027s pregnant with a child, and they even bring people closer to God.\\n\\n Avi takes my hand in his as we stop at each stage of development and study the fetuses. They\u0027re labeled as male or female (even identical twins are labeled) and how many weeks old they are.\\n\\n Avi puts his hand up to the glass, right in front of the fetus that looks fully developed except it\u0027s so small. \"I\u0027ve never seen anything like this,\" he says.\\n\\n I know it\u0027s not everyone\u0027s favorite exhibit, and if you really think about it it\u0027s kind of creepy. But it makes me feel good knowing I\u0027ve shared it with Avi and he appreciates it as much as I do. Maybe one day...\\n\\n I look over at Avi. He smiles. I can tell he\u0027s thinking the same thing.\\n\\n In the afternoon, I take him along with Mutt to my mom\u0027s house. I can\u0027t have Avi go back to Israel without meeting the other half of my nuclear family, although I\u0027m not sure how Marc and Mom will act around him. And now that we\u0027ve just seen the neonatal exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry, I hope my mom being pregnant doesn\u0027t freak Avi out.\\n\\n As soon Mom sees Mutt, she says, \"Do you have to bring the animal?\" she says.\\n\\n \"Mom, you have a yard he can run in. He loves your yard.\"\\n\\n Since I\u0027m keeping Mutt on an extender leash at the park so he doesn\u0027t impregnate anyone else\u0027s dog, my mom\u0027s place is like Freedom City for him.\\n\\n \"Last time you didn\u0027t pick up all of his poop, Amy. Marc stepped in a little present last week.\"\\n\\n Way to go, Mutt! \"Sorry, Mom,\" I try and say sincerely, although in the back of my head I think God had something to do with it. B\u0027shert, right? Meant to be.\\n\\n \"Amy, don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re sorry. Tell Marc.\"\\n\\n After I let Mutt loose in the backyard, my mom says, \"I\u0027m going to assume you\u0027re Avi.\"\\n\\n Avi gives her one of his killer smiles, putting on the Avi charm, and shakes her hand. My heart flips over because I know he\u0027s doing it for me, that it\u0027s important to him that my mom likes him. And maybe because he\u0027s lost some brownie points with my dad after last night and he wants to rack some up with my mom before he leaves. Smart guy.\\n\\n \"So, how old are you again?\" Mom asks as she pats down her model blonde hair. If I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d think my mom was trying to rack up brownie points with Avi.\\n\\n Amy, don\u0027t go off on her. She\u0027s not embarrassing you on purpose. Wait to interfere when she pulls out the naked baby pictures.\\n\\n \"Eighteen,\" Avi replies.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re in the Israeli army?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n My mom sits down at the kitchen table and says, \"So...what do you do there?\"\\n\\n \"Mom, he\u0027s training to be a commando,\" I say, interrupting. \"He can\u0027t tell you what he does all day.\"\\n\\n \"Do you shoot guns?\"\\n\\n Avi looks from me to my mom and back. \"When we have to,\" he says.\\n\\n I need a Coke. This is harder than I thought. I open the refrigerator, but there\u0027s no Coke... no Diet Coke, no Cherry Coke, no Vanilla Coke. There\u0027s not even a Coke Zero. \"Uh, Mom, where\u0027s the Coke?\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have any in the house. It\u0027s not good for the baby,\" she says, then touches her stomach.\\n\\n As I stare at her hand caressing her abdomen, I think about the neonatal exhibit we saw today. For the first time, I can picture what my little brother or sister looks like right now. The size of my fist...or maybe even smaller.\\n\\n Marc stumbles into the kitchen, introduces himself to Avi, and the two shake hands. \"Do you play golf?\" Marc asks, then sneezes into a handkerchief he just pulled from his pocket.\\n\\n \"No. Soccer\u0027s my sport,\" Avi says, then looks to me. I shrug, confused. Does Marc want to go hit a few at the range with Avi to test his skill with a club? Or is he desperately trying to have a manly sports conversation or, scarier yet, a sports competition?\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you boys see if there\u0027s a soccer game on TV while Amy helps me set the table?\"\\n\\n \"I can help, too,\" Avi says.\\n\\n \"Go ahead,\" I say and push him gently out of the kitchen. I need private time to gossip about him with my mom.\\n\\n While Marc and Avi settle into the living room, my mom and I set the table. Mom is smiling wide and staring at me as if I just got engaged or something. \"He\u0027s adorable,\" she says. \"I can see how you can be so hung up on him.\"\\n\\n Hung up on him? I\u0027m a little more than hung up on him, I\u0027m full blown in love with the guy and even being one room away I realize is too far for me. I don\u0027t even want to think about tomorrow, when I have to drive him to the airport and watch a plane taking off with him inside.\\n\\n Staring at the fresh flowers in the middle of the kitchen table, I say, \"Mom, how many times have you been in love?\"\\n\\n \"How many times did I think I was in love or how many times have I really been in love?\"\\n\\n \"How do you know the difference?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t. Well, not at the time you\u0027re having the feelings. I was in love with Danny Peterson in high school; we dated my junior and senior year.\"\\n\\n \"What happened with Danny?\"\\n\\n \"I caught him kissing Shayna Middleton under the bleachers during gym class. Guess he didn\u0027t love me as much as I loved him. Then there was your dad.\"\\n\\n Deep in my mom\u0027s blue eyes I detect sadness. \"Why didn\u0027t you marry him, Mom? I know he wanted to marry you, but you wouldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n She wrings her hands together on the table. \"My parents ... your grandparents... they didn\u0027t think your father was good for me. He was a foreigner, someone who might leave me and go back to Israel or who knows where. Or marry me just for citizenship and leave me.\"\\n\\n \"Do you wish things were different?\" I ask. I mean, if she married my dad when she got pregnant then I wouldn\u0027t have to deal with a sneezing stepdad and my parents wouldn\u0027t live miles away from each other. We\u0027d be a whole family, not a broken one.\\n\\n She says softly, \"To be honest...no. It would have never worked between your father and me. He\u0027s married to his work, and I need a man who\u0027ll pay attention to me. Marc maneuvers his work schedule around me, not the other way around.\"\\n\\n A little piece of hope in my chest disappears with her words. Every birthday I prayed my parents would get together--every penny I threw into fountains, every time I blew an eyelash off of my finger. Now I realize all the hoping and praying wasn\u0027t going to change the course of things. There are some things I can\u0027t change, after all.\\n\\n \"Do you wish you\u0027d never had me?\" I say with a lump in my throat.\\n\\n Her eyes go wide, \"No! Amy, I wouldn\u0027t change having you for anything in the world.\"\\n\\n \"Mom, I was a mistake. Face it, you didn\u0027t mean to get pregnant in college on a one-night stand.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s just say you weren\u0027t expected. But there was no way I was giving you up and when I held you in my arms the first time after giving birth to you, I cried so hard...from happiness, Amy. Because I\u0027d never known how much I wanted you until I held you. From that moment on, you had my heart. I know I haven\u0027t been the best mom. I\u0027ve grown up while raising you and made many mistakes.\"\\n\\n We all make mistakes. \"I have, too.\" But I\u0027m trying to mend them.\\n\\n Will my dad ever maneuver his work around a woman? Yeah, maybe when he\u0027s a hundred years old and is forced to slow down. I need to find out why he works so much, what drives him to put his personal life second to his work life.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Amy,\" Mom says, giving me a puppy dog look Mutt would be proud of. \"I wish I could have given you the family you\u0027ve always wanted.\"\\n\\n I smile warmly and stop her hands from wringing by putting my hands over hers. \"It\u0027s okay, Mom. For the first time in my life, I understand.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-28.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) \\n In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
