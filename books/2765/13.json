They\u0027ve even overcome God\u0027s anger (Exodus 32:10). Overcoming obstacles is in my Jewish blood.\\n\\n \"The whole school thinks I\u0027m gay.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m standing at my locker, fishing for my U.S. history book. It\u0027s in here somewhere. \"Did you say something?\" I say sweetly to Nathan, still keeping my attention on the books stacked in my locker.\\n\\n \"Amy.\"\\n\\n Oh, there it is. I reach out and grab my book, wondering when Mr. Krazinski will spring a pop quiz on us. Maybe I should take the book home tonight and read it.\\n\\n Nathan grabs my arm, pulling me away from my locker. \"Ouch,\" I say. He\u0027s stronger than I\u0027d ever give him credit for, but it doesn\u0027t hurt. I rub my arm for effect.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t hurt you. Yet.\"\\n\\n \"What do you want from me, Nathan? I\u0027ve got to get to class and I\u0027m already late.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s wearing a stark white button-down shirt and pleated navy pants. I\u0027m not even concentrating on his lack of fashion sense because I\u0027m trying not to look at his eyes. I keep thinking about that ludicrous comment Miranda said about emeralds.\\n\\n \"I want you to admit you told the entire school I\u0027m gay-\"\\n\\n Leaning back against the lockers while avoiding his eyes, I say, \"Listen, Nathan. I didn\u0027t tell anyone you\u0027re gay. I may have said you\u0027re not into girls.\"\\n\\n \"Why, \u0027cause I\u0027m not into you?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s low, Nathan.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I can get lower, Amy. Just try me.\" He steps forward and straddles both hands on the lockers behind me, locking me in. \"Look at me.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d like to still keep my gaze on the wall opposite him, but that would be cowardly. I\u0027m anything but a coward. He\u0027s tall and close. I can smell spicy cologne radiating off his body. And when I look up, I\u0027m staring straight into his eyes because his glasses have slipped down. I swallow then say, \"What\u0027s wrong with people thinking you\u0027re gay? Jason Hill is gay and he\u0027s probably the most popular guy in school--with girls as well as guys.\"\\n\\n \"If I was, I wouldn\u0027t give a shit. But I\u0027m not.\"\\n\\n \"So tell everyone you\u0027re hetero. Just like I have to tell everyone I didn\u0027t join a dating service.\" I shove his arm out of the way and head to class, thinking all the while that his personality does not in any way match his looks. It\u0027s like dressing a buffalo up as a hyena. It\u0027s just not right.\\n\\n Jessica is in my U.S. history class. I sit in my usual spot next to her after being grilled by Mr. Krazinski about why I was late. I lied and said it was a feminine problem and that quieted him real quick.\\n\\n Jess looks horrible. I\u0027d be surprised if she took a shower this morning, she looks so disheveled. Her brown hair is frizzed out; she\u0027s wearing sweats and no makeup. I don\u0027t care if she was insensitive to me last night. I need to find out what\u0027s going on. I\u0027ve been best friends with Jess for twelve years. Our friendship can weather any fight.\\n\\n I hope.\\n\\n Now I\u0027m worried. She won\u0027t even look in my direction, so I wait until the bell rings to corner her. I swear this school should be called Drama Academy instead of Chicago Academy today.\\n\\n When the bell rings, Jess grabs her stuff and hurries out of the classroom faster than a jackrabbit being chased by a dog. I push the other students out of my way to catch up with her. I\u0027m hearing curses from guys as I shove past them but all I can think about is my friend in trouble.\\n\\n I find her in the girls\u0027 bathroom. \"Jess, I know you\u0027re in here. I saw you.\" When I get no answer, I continue. \"I admit I\u0027ve been wrapped up in my own crap and have ignored you, but please let\u0027s talk about it.\"\\n\\n The door to one of the stalls opens. It\u0027s Roxanne Jeffries.\\n\\n With a toss of her red hair and a smirk on her face, she says, \"I hear Mitch dumped Jessica for a freshman.\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Roxy, or I\u0027ll tell people you got implants last summer when you told everyone you went to overnight camp,\" I hiss.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a bitch,\" Roxanne says with a huff.\\n\\n \"So I\u0027ve been told. Now scram. Your perfume is making me ill. Or maybe it\u0027s your B.O. that reeks.\"\\n\\n Roxanne washes her hands, then storms out of the bathroom.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not a bitch,\" Jessica\u0027s voice bellows from one of the stalls. I can tell from her tone she\u0027s been crying. \"You\u0027re just preoccupied.\"\\n\\n \"No, I think everyone\u0027s right. I\u0027m a bitch because no matter what\u0027s going on in my own life, I should never let down my best friend.\"\\n\\n Jess pushes open the stall door with bundled-up tissue in her hand. \"I\u0027m sorry what I said about you and Avi.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry for not realizing earlier that you\u0027re having a crisis. What\u0027s up? Is what Roxanne just said true?\"\\n\\n Her eyes get watery and I hand her a paper towel. \"Mitch called me before I left for the youth group thing last night. He said he had something important to talk to me about. I tried getting it out of him, but he said we\u0027d just talk later. I asked him if it was good news and he said no.\"\\n\\n I bite my bottom lip in fear. \"He didn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"Yep. After I got home from the youth group thing I called him. He broke up with me and said he was asking Kailey Pulson to the Valentine\u0027s Dance.\"\\n\\n My eyebrows furrow in confusion. \"Kailey Pulson? Freshman Kailey Pulson?\" Kailey Pulson is a total jock girl. I think she rock climbs for fun.\\n\\n Tears run down Jess\u0027s cheeks as she nods. \"Now what am I gonna do?\"\\n\\n The bell rings again. I\u0027m late for another class. \"I\u0027ll figure something out, Jess. They don\u0027t call me your best friend for nothing. What we have to do is find us both hot dates for the dance. Leave it to me.\"\\n\\n Jess sniffles. \"To be honest, right now I don\u0027t want to go. The last thing I want to do is see Kailey and Mitch together.\"\\n\\n She has a point. As I open the door to the bathroom, I turn back and face my best friend. \"Then we\u0027ll just hang out, the two of us dateless girls. We\u0027ll watch DVDs, order pizza, and gossip all night. Sound good?\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Amy,\" Jess says.\\n\\n I got to English class late because of my chitchat with Jess in the bathroom, but Miss Haskell has a sub so it wasn\u0027t a big deal. Can it be a sign of good karma coming my way?\\n\\n At lunch I pay for the salad bar, then search for Mitch. I\u0027m going to find my old boyfriend and give him a piece of my mind. Jessica told me not to. She wants me to leave him alone but I can\u0027t.\\n\\n \"Barbie,\" a male voice says from behind me. I whip around. Of course it\u0027s Nathan. Nobody else would have the nerve to call me Barbie. Without saying another word, he pulls me close and starts kissing me.\\n\\n I mean really kissing me. To the point where I drop my food tray and don\u0027t even care I\u0027ve just made a mess on the floor and on my shoes with a mixture of lettuce and vegetables and Thousand Island dressing. Nathan\u0027s soft, inviting lips are open to mine and just when I\u0027m about to pull back and yell at him, he snakes his hand around my waist and pulls me closer.\\n\\n My brain is telling me to pull away even though my lips are as involved as Nathan\u0027s are right now. I grab onto Nathan\u0027s biceps and attempt to push him away, but he\u0027s too strong and I\u0027m not as determined as I want to be.\\n\\n Nathan is the one to pull back first, after his glasses hit my face and I wince. He turns to the crowd with a huge grin after he pushes his glasses up and says, \"Fine, I\u0027ll go to the Valentine\u0027s Dance with you.\"\\n\\n Fine? Nothing is fine around here.\\n\\n The cafeteria is in an uproar with cheers from the guys. I\u0027m still in a daze when the lunchroom lady, Gladys, sees the salad mess on the floor and moves us aside with a look of disgust and comments about PDA rules at Chicago Academy.\\n\\n When my eyes finally focus, I\u0027m still in shock. Nathan tries to help pick up the mess with Gladys, but she shoos him away with a wave of her hand.\\n\\n Without a word, I walk through the cafeteria and plop myself down at a lunch table next to an open-mouthed Miranda. I know. I never sit at Miranda\u0027s table. I just know Miranda and her friends don\u0027t gossip like my friends do.\\n\\n I give her a small smile. Unfortunately Mr. Emerald Eyes follows my lead and sits down next to me.\\n\\n \"Here,\" he says, shoving a brown bag at me. \"It\u0027s my lunch. You can have it since you dropped yours.\"\\n\\n As if he\u0027s a gentleman. Puh leaze.\\n\\n I look over at Jessica, sitting at the popular girls\u0027 table. Less than two hours ago I told her I\u0027d stay home for the Valentine\u0027s Dance instead of going. She probably thinks I was lying and I\u0027m hooking up with Nathan.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not hungry.\" I bark the words at Nathan. In fact, I don\u0027t think I could eat all day after that kiss.\\n\\n 14\\n\\n I love listening to Hebrew prayers put to song. I have no clue what the words mean, but hearing the cantor and congregation sing together makes me want to chant right along with them.\\n\\n Okay, I admit it. Nathan surprised me. I would have never guessed the guy would go ahead and do a crazy thing like kiss me in the cafeteria and declare us a Valentine\u0027s Dance couple. Now all the kids at school are whispering about us behind my back, in front of my back, and all around me. They\u0027re waiting with bated breath for another Amy/Nathan spotting.\\n\\n I\u0027m not gonna let that happen.\\n\\n So after school I take a cab home instead of waiting for the bus. If Nathan has no problems kissing me in front of half of the student body, what other stunt is he going to pull on the bus ride home?\\n\\n After I let Mutt do his duty, I walk over to Perk Me Up! The rich smells coming from the café immediately make me feel energized and lift my spirits. I don\u0027t even need to consume the coffee in order to get the caffeine fix.\\n\\n Maria hands me an apron and I\u0027m immediately into Perk Me Up! employee mode. I clean off tables, start taking orders, and try to keep a big bright smile on my face. Show teeth when you smile, Maria told me last week. Yeah, I\u0027m trying.\\n\\n My toothy smile fades when Nathan walks in to the café. He has his backpack slung over his shoulder and I didn\u0027t notice it before, but he\u0027s got splotches of Thousand Island dressing on his white shirt. I don\u0027t think those stains are going to come out.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he says when he reaches the register. Unfortunately nobody else is in line behind him.\\n\\n Maria stands beside me, watching and listening.\\n\\n I ignore Nathan\u0027s apology and instead say to him, \"Welcome to Perk Me Up! Can I take your order, sir?\"\\n\\n \"Come on, Barbie. You kissed me yesterday. Why am I the villain for kissing you today?\"\\n\\n \"You kissed him?\" Maria asks.\\n\\n I turn to her. \"Only because I wanted him to stop hating me.\"\\n\\n Maria\u0027s eyebrows furrow in fascination. \"You kiss people who hate you?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t hate her,\" Nathan chimes in.\\n\\n \"Oh, really?\" I say sarcastically, putting my hands on my hips. \"Then why do you keep calling me Barbie? And why didn\u0027t you kiss me back yesterday when we were in the elevator, but today you have no problem making out with me with the entire school watching?\"\\n\\n \"It was to prove a point.\"\\n\\n \"To prove you\u0027re not gay? Listen, you\u0027re not cute enough to be gay.\"\\n\\n Nathan laughs. \"Are you kidding me? You are the most stereotypical, insensitive, and obnoxious girl I\u0027ve ever met.\"\\n\\n \"I take offense to that,\" I say, then cross my arms in front of my chest.\\n\\n \"Me, too,\" Maria interjects. \"Amy\u0027s rough around the edges, but she\u0027s as good as gold.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-13.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) \\n In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
