{"id":85757,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"I remember back to when my mom took me to my first ballet lesson. I\u0027d begged for her to sign me up and practically dragged her to Miss Gertie\u0027s Dance Studio where Jessica was already taking lessons. My mom paid the hefty tuition, bought me ballet slippers and a cute leotard, and off we went to the first class. Only there was one problem: I refused to go inside the studio. For some unknown reason (even to me) I cried in the car until my mom dragged me kicking and screaming into that studio.\n She forced me to go.\n In retaliation, I sat in the corner of the studio and refused to move even one pink ballet-slippered foot the entire time. This routine continued lesson after lesson until the costumes came in for the recital. My class danced to a song called \"The Buzy Bees.\" We were little bees with black and yellow sparkly sequined leotards and black springy sparkly antennas. What can I say, all those sparkles would turn any reluctant kid into an instant ballerina just waiting to go on stage. The day those costumes came in, I stood up from my usual spot and danced and buzzed around as if I was making up for lost time.\n Those ballet lessons made me learn one thing:\n My mom is a patient parent beyond belief. And she\u0027ll wait anything out until I cave.\n \"Amy, I know it\u0027s not easy for you. Too many changes in such a short time.\" She looks up at the sign to Modern Maternity. \"Should we just go back home? Or go bra shopping for you? I can do this another day.\"\n \"No, we\u0027re already here. You might as well get some clothes that won\u0027t strangle the baby.\" Besides, I don\u0027t want to go bra shopping with my mom. She\u0027ll probably pick out those big hefty white ones that resemble tablecloths with straps.\n Mom needs no further encouragement. She\u0027s out of the car as if someone was pushing her enlarged butt forward. I swear, my mom used to have a body an aerobics instructor would be jealous of. Now...well, let\u0027s just say she\u0027s changed a lot.\n I follow her into the store, silently hoping the salesperson doesn\u0027t mistake me for the customer.\n \"Can I help you ladies?\" the short and perky salesperson asks, looking from my mom to me and back.\n My mom touches her stomach again. \"Well, I\u0027m about three months along now and am outgrowing my clothes already\"\n The lady claps her hands together. \"Are we looking for casual or business attire...or do you need something for a specific occasion?\"\n I\u0027d like to cut the word \"we\" from the woman\u0027s vocabulary.\n \"Casual. And business.\"\n While the lady shows my mom around the store, I follow in silence. To be honest, though, some of the clothes aren\u0027t too bad. And before long my mom is trying the stuff on, making me go with her into the dressing room.\n On the bench I catch sight of something weird. It\u0027s like a cream-colored pouch with strings coming out of it. \"I think someone left something in here,\" I tell the saleslady, pointing to the strange object.\n \"No, there\u0027s one in every dressing room. It\u0027s to strap to your stomach to make you look five to six months pregnant.\"\n I can\u0027t help the giggle that escapes my mouth. My mom shushes me, then closes the dressing room door. \"Can I try it on?\" I ask.\n Before my mom can stop me, I pick up my shirt, tie the pouch around my waist, and pull my shirt back down. \"That\u0027s not really the image I want of my seventeen-year-old daughter,\" Mom says, eyeing me rub my tummy like she does.\n I wonder what it would be like to be pregnant. A baby growing inside your body until it can survive on its own. Turning sideways, I check myself out in the mirror. Do I want kids? I mean, I feel sorry for my parents that they have to deal with me. Sometimes I think I\u0027m not normal, that I\u0027m long overdue for a psychotherapist to straighten me out. Then at other times I feel like everyone else is a mashed-potato nutcase and I\u0027m the only sane one.\n Maybe Mom\u0027s banking on this new kid to be the normal one, the one who\u0027s freak-out resistant.\n I stare at my mom\u0027s stomach as she tries on a black and white suit with a stretchy panel in the front of the pants. It makes me realize what a big deal this must be for her. She\u0027s not just getting big; she\u0027s creating another human being, one she\u0027ll be responsible for forever.\n \"You can touch my stomach if you want,\" she says.\n I do, but I don\u0027t. I remember I used to lay my head on her stomach and laugh as I heard gurgling noises coming from it. Now there\u0027s a baby growing inside there...\n I guess she senses my hesitation, because she takes my hand and places it on her bulging tummy. \"Can you feel it moving?\" I ask.\n \"Not yet.\"\n I gaze at my hand on her belly, close to my half brother or sister. As much as I know it\u0027s weird for my mom to have a kid, I\u0027m feeling unusually protective of it right now. I pull my hand away; this is getting a little too weird for me.\n She tries on a big white shirt with an arrow pointing down saying Future Physician. \"What do you think?\" she asks, holding her arms out wide to give me the full view.\n \"I think it\u0027s weak sauce.\"\n \"Weak sauce?\" she says, scrunching up her face in confusion. \"New slang I don\u0027t know about?\"\n \"You know...same as lame. It\u0027s all about the sauce. If it\u0027s bad sauce, nobody likes it.\"\n \"Is this one lame sauce?\"\n I don\u0027t correct her and tell her it\u0027s weak sauce, not lame sauce.\n Now she\u0027s holding out one that says Almost done.\n \"You can get it, but I\u0027m not going out with you in public if you\u0027re wearing it. Don\u0027t they have one saying I\u0027m a Dorky Mom?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t see that one on the racks,\" she says, teasing me.\n In the end, she picks out a pants suit for work, one dress, two pairs of jeans, and three T-shirts that don\u0027t have writing on them. I swear, before my mom was married and actually had a job, she dressed like she was a Vogue model. She knew everything about fashion and taught me so much. Now, my mom got married, quit her job, and seriously does not know what\u0027s in. I hope after the baby is born she\u0027ll change back into the same mom I had before.\n \"Are you staying over for dinner?\" she asks when we\u0027re on the way back to her house.\n \"Sorry, can\u0027t. I\u0027m going to some Jewish teen group thing with Jessica.\"\n \"You sure about this Jewish route, Amy? Marc and I were discussing it the other day, and we just don\u0027t understand this sudden interest in conversion.\"\n Mom doesn\u0027t understand that during my trip to Israel last summer I changed. It\u0027s like I found a missing piece of myself. It\u0027s a small piece, but sometimes I feel like when I find the missing pieces of myself I get closer to being whole. \"It\u0027s not sudden, Mom.\"\n \"What does your father say? From what I know, he\u0027s not all that religious himself.\"\n I look out the window, fighting the urge to argue with her. Converting to Judaism is something I feel strongly about. It has nothing to do with my dad or my mom. It has everything to do with me. To argue and try to make her see my side is pointless. My mom has her own opinions about organized religion and I don\u0027t share her view.\n When Sofia gave me a Jewish star pendant, I felt something I\u0027d never felt before. A connection to people I had previously not acknowledged. And when I climbed Masada, it really hit me. My dad is Jewish, so half of me is Jewish. To ignore it suddenly felt like it would be dissing a part of who I am. I admit, learning about Judaism and reading the Tanakh (that would be the Torah and learning about the numerous Prophets) isn\u0027t easy. And, to be honest, I don\u0027t totally agree with or understand the Torah.\n Rabbi Glassman encourages discussion, even disagreements. Which is great, because I\u0027m disagreeable by nature. I question everything, like why Abraham really was going to kill his son. And it\u0027s obvious men wrote the Bible (it\u0027s a bit male-centered if I do say so myself.) But did the stories actually happen or were they made up? \"Dad supports me.\"\n \"But can\u0027t they consider you Jewish because your father is? It\u0027s seems silly to have you go through months of classes--\"\n \"They\u0027re not making me do it, Mom.\" She just doesn\u0027t get it. Or maybe she doesn\u0027t want to get it. \"I don\u0027t have to convert. I want to convert. Just...leave it alone, okay?\"\n Mom shrugs. \"Okay, okay. I just want you to be happy.\"\n \"Then stop nagging me about religion. Nag me about something else instead.\"\n Looking at me sideways, my mom smiles. Oops, I should never have said that. Because...you guessed it, she takes me to Sally\u0027s Intimate Boutique on the other side of town to get me fitted for bras.\n Mom drives me back to the condo in the city after the bra run. I kiss her goodbye, get out of the car, and attempt to hide the girly pink bag under my arm. It\u0027s gotten so cold I pull my coat tight around me, but catch sight of Nathan standing on the curb with a bouquet of yellow tulips in his hand.\n I\u0027m still watching Nathan as my mom drives off. When the public bus heading to Evanston stops at the corner, Nathan gets on without a backward glance.\n Hmm.\n I wonder if he\u0027s going to see Binky...I mean Bicky. Not that I believe he\u0027s actually dating that girl in the picture in his room.\n I still haven\u0027t figured him out. Why is he staying at his aunt and uncle\u0027s house? If it\u0027s not temporary, why is he still living out of his suitcase? If it\u0027s not temporary, why is he going to my school? The whole thing doesn\u0027t add up.\n Shaking thoughts of Nathan from my head, I run up to my condo before my dad gets home. Hurriedly, I check my dad\u0027s still-open PJSN account. The only problem is he\u0027ll kill me if I set him up on another date. I have to come up with another scheme, something creative.\n I\u0027ve heard about speed dating, where a person goes on a bunch of three-minute dates in one night. Hmm... maybe I can convince Maria to host one of them at Perk Me Up! one night. I must admit I have the best ideas.\n My dad walks in the door just as I\u0027m closing out the PJSN account. He asks me about my weekend without him. I ask him about his trip. We eat dinner together while playing shesh besh, which is Hebrew for backgammon. It\u0027s something we both like to play. We even have a little rivalry going on.\n I answer the phone when it rings after dinner, knowing before I even check the caller ID that it\u0027s Jessica. \"I need best friend advice,\" Jess says.\n \"Me, too. I need to know what I should wear tonight.\" I mean, I haven\u0027t been to a youth group meeting in...well, never.\n \"I thought you were going to wear your Fuego jeans and that heather-gray top you got last week at Saks.\"\n I lay down on my bed in frustration, petting Mutt who just jumped on my stomach and almost knocked the wind out of me. \"I was, but decided against it. I was thinking about wearing my long print skirt and a plain white shirt.\"\n There\u0027s a big huff on the other end of the line. \"Amy, you don\u0027t have to dress religious for the group.\"\n \"Come over and help me pick something to wear tonight. Please? I\u0027ll do your makeup for you and listen to your Mitch problems at the same time.\"\n Jessica loves when I do her makeup. She will absolutely come over. I know her weakness is the two Ms--Mitch and makeup. For the double Ms, she\u0027ll go through the torture of finding a parking spot on the overcrowded Chicago streets.\n \"Um...I\u0027m picking up Miranda Cohen first,\" Jess says.\n \"Miranda Cohen?\" I ask. \"The girl who hyperventilated when we ran the mile in gym last year?\" Poor Miranda. The Diet Coke she drinks just doesn\u0027t erase the other crap from her system.\n \"Miranda\u0027s in the youth group.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-10.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: \n How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) \n In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
