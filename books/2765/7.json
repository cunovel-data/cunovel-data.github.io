{"id":85754,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"8\n Deborah was a great prophetess of Israel, even led Israel for a time (fudges 4:4). She ordered a man named Barak (relation to me, perhaps?) to take ten thousand men into battle. Barak told Deborah that he\u0027d only do it if Deborah came with him. Kind of parallels my life, doesn\u0027t it? Also reinforces that men need women to back them up.\n I want to protest, but the backpack is being shoved into my hands. \"Dad, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll come back to get it once he realizes--\"\n \"Amy, don\u0027t be a snob.\"\n My mouth opens wide in shock. My own flesh and blood just called me a snob. I head out the door and into our condo building entrance. I wave to the doorman, who buzzes me into the elevator banks.\n \"Amy, come back here,\" my dad says.\n I put my hands on my hips. \"I can\u0027t believe you, of all people, called me a snob.\"\n My dad never backs down. I guess being an ex-commando makes you act like a tough guy in your personal as well as army life. Occupational hazard. \"Just because he doesn\u0027t look like the kids you hang out with doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be friends with him.\"\n \"Dad, he told Kyle Sanderson I joined a dating service because I couldn\u0027t get a date for the Valentine\u0027s Dance.\" Who\u0027s the snob now?\n My dad looks concerned; his eyebrows are furrowed as he contemplates this new piece of information. Taking a deep breath, he tells me, \"Then confront him about it.\"\n Spoken like a true Israeli.\n We\u0027re in the elevator, which has just reached our floor. Stepping off, I turn around to face my father and hold out Nathan\u0027s backpack (which weighs a ton, I might add). \"You give it to him. Then you can ream him out for spreading rumors about your daughter.\"\n \"We\u0027ll go together.\"\n Ooh, partners in crime. \"Fine.\"\n \"Fine.\"\n I follow him to Nathan\u0027s aunt and uncle\u0027s condo right down the hall from us. My dad knocks obnoxiously loud, like he doesn\u0027t know the power of his own strength. That\u0027s my dad.\n Mr. Keener opens the door, but doesn\u0027t invite us in.\n \"Nathan left his backpack in the caf√©,\" my dad says. \"Amy wanted to bring it back to him.\"\n Mr. Keener smiles and opens the door. \"You can go give it to him. He\u0027s in the guest room. It\u0027s the second door on the right.\"\n My dad puts his hand on the small of my back and pushes me forward. I\u0027ve never been into their condo. Mr. and Mrs. Keener keep pretty much to themselves. I step inside the foyer. I\u0027m feeling awkward so I\u0027m glad my dad is backing me up.\n A cell phone rings; it\u0027s my dad\u0027s ring tone. The national anthem of Israel. Dorky, but totally him. He\u0027s still in the hallway as he answers the call. \"Sorry, motek, I have to take this,\" he says as he waves and leaves me in the Keeners\u0027 condo.\n Oh, just great.\n So now I\u0027m faced with going into Nathan\u0027s room. All alone. With absolutely no backup.\n Mr. Keener waves me toward Nathan\u0027s room. Okay, I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027m not afraid of that guy. In fact, after I shove his backpack at him, I\u0027m going to give him a piece of my mind.\n Because nobody makes a fool out of Amy Nelson-Barak.\n I walk with purpose to the second door on the right. The door is closed, so I have to knock. Looking back, I see Mr. Keener hasn\u0027t followed. I knock lightly at first with the hand not holding the backpack. No response. I knock a little harder.\n After I get no response again, I think he might not be home after all. Which is a good thing, I think. I mean, I want to confront him and everything but I\u0027m not sure I want to do it on his turf. I know the advantage to warfare. On your own turf you have the upper hand.\n I check the doorknob to see if it\u0027s locked. Nope. I turn the knob and crack the door open so I can peek inside.\n Nathan\u0027s in the room, but he\u0027s listening to his iPod while banging a pencil against a binder, so he can\u0027t hear me.\n Sure enough, as soon as I look at his face I catch two green eyes narrowing at me.\n \"I can see you,\" he says.\n Damn. I open the door wide and walk in, watching as he takes the earphones out of his ears. \"You left your backpack at Perk Me Up! I brought it as a goodwill gesture.\"\n The guy just shrugs. Thanks would have been nice. Nathan is in dire need of etiquette lessons.\n As I drop his backpack, I scan the room. It\u0027s obviously the guest room. Old bookshelves line the side wall and a pullout bed is open and takes up most of the room. Nathan is leaning on the bed, against the back, just staring at me.\n \"Who\u0027s the girl?\" I ask, picking up a picture of a cute blonde girl in a bikini with short hair and abs I can\u0027t even imagine having. \"Your sister?\"\n Nathan pushes his glasses up his nose and says, \"It\u0027s my girlfriend.\"\n Yeah, right. There is absolutely no way this is Nathan\u0027s girlfriend. I\u0027d bet my dog on it.\n \"What\u0027s her name?\" I ask, curiosity getting the best of me.\n \"Bicky.\"\n Wait. What did he say? \"Becky?\" I ask. The other alternative is downright ludicrous. \"Bicky,\" he says again. \"Bicky!\"\n \"Now you\u0027re acting Barbie all over again.\"\n \"Was she born with that name or is it a nickname?\" I ask, ignoring the insult.\n Nathan slides off the bed and snatches the picture out of my hand. \"Her name is Bicky. No nickname. Just Bicky.\"\n While he shoves the picture into his half-zippered suitcase, I say, \"You accuse me of being so Barbie when you\u0027re the one who\u0027s deliberately spreading untrue rumors about me just so you could seem cool.\"\n \"I did no such thing,\" he says. \"And I definitely don\u0027t want to hang around with your friends, if that\u0027s what you mean.\"\n \"You told Kyle I joined a dating service. For your information... and not that it\u0027s any of your business, but I signed my dad up.\"\n Nathan shrugs, as if falsely tarnishing my reputation is no biggie.\n \"Why do you hate me so much?\"\n He rubs his hand on top of his shaggy, light brown hair that resembles the color of maple syrup, and sighs. \"I don\u0027t hate you, Amy. I just hate people like you.\"\n \"Same difference,\" I say, then storm out of the condo. When I stomp into my own place, my dad is sitting at the dining room table, still on the phone as he shuffles through some papers.\n Men. I feel the taste for revenge. I head to the back office, where the computer is, and type in www.pjsn.com. It prompts me to type in my login name and password.\n I have fifty-five new people who left messages on my dad\u0027s profile and the two women I asked out for my dad responded. Wow. The human resources worker, Kelly, would love to do coffee, how about next week? and the lawyer, Wendy, says she\u0027s looking for an American guy so she\u0027s not interested.\n Good. I didn\u0027t want a lawyer to be my stepmom anyway. Lawyers probably follow all the rules and regs in life. That\u0027s not my style. I live inside the gray areas and love it.\n I e-mail the human resources lady back and ask her to meet me (aka my dad) at Perk Me Up! tomorrow night at seven.\n As I settle into the chair, I hear a crinkling sound from my back pocket. Oh my God. I can\u0027t believe I forgot with all the Nathan-and-my-dad commotion to open Avi\u0027s letter. Is my forgetfulness a betrayal of our relationship?\n Uncrinkling it, I sink back in my bed and open the envelope.\n \"Sorry, Avi.\" He can\u0027t hear me, but maybe my conscience can.\n As I unfold the letter, my heartbeat starts racing.\n Amy,\n You know I\u0027m not good with letters, but I promised to write so I\u0027m writing. I\u0027m assigned to a new army base, but I can\u0027t tell you where it is. Top secret stuff I can tell you that I shot a new gun today. I know you hate guns, but this one was cool. It shoots around corners. We run every day until I think my legs are going to fall off. Tomorrow my unit will be dropped off in the Negev in the middle of the night to see if we can navigate with nothing but the stars to guide us through the desert. I guess that\u0027s it. If I survive desert training I\u0027ll write you again. You know I miss you, don\u0027t you?\n Avi\n I hold the letter to my chest, concentrating on the last sentence. You know I miss you, don\u0027t you? Avi isn\u0027t one of those sappy guys; he\u0027s guarded because he lost his brother in a bombing and hasn\u0027t let himself open up, be vulnerable, and grieve. And I know he doesn\u0027t want me to wait around for him while he spends his required three years in the Israeli military, so he doesn\u0027t write romantic and mushy letters.\n I don\u0027t want a romantic and mushy guy, anyway. I want Avi. Oh, I know I\u0027m not going to even see him until the summer when I go back to Israel. I\u0027m not holding my breath that he\u0027ll be waiting for me. Okay, I am. But I\u0027m not admitting it publicly.\n Leaning over my nightstand, I open the drawer and pull out Avi\u0027s silver chain link bracelet. He gave it to me after we started dating this past summer. I also pull out a picture of him. It was after our last official date, when he gave me Mutt and a sushi dinner. I snatched a photo with my dad\u0027s camera right before our last goodbye.\n I stare at the picture, him with his mocha eyes and thick head of dark hair to match. Not to mention his signature half-smile, which can make my heart stop. There is no way the girls in Israel are going to leave him alone; that\u0027s a given. It scares me and brings out my worst insecurities. I\u0027m not pretty enough, my boobs are too big, I\u0027m not skinny enough.\n Ugh, I hate when I pick myself apart and focus on the negatives. Avi likes me for who I am. I know he does.\n Kissing his picture would be the dorkiest thing. I\u0027d never do that. But I do clutch his picture to my chest and hug it. It\u0027s still dorky, but less so than actually kissing it.\n \"Amy, I\u0027m sorry but it was an important call.\"\n Great, now my dad is invading my personal space and witnessed me hugging a picture. The only thing keeping me from telling him how important knocking on a teenager\u0027s door is the revenge date I\u0027m setting him up on. \"You know what your problem is?\" I tell him.\n \"What.\"\n \"You think work is more important than your personal life.\"\n He takes life way too seriously, but I\u0027m trying to help him loosen up and not be such a stiff. It\u0027s the work part that worries me. I swear he\u0027s gonna have a heart attack one of these days if he doesn\u0027t let up on the work hours.\n He walks closer to my bed and I slip the picture of Avi and his letter under my pillow.\n \"I have responsibilities, Amy. Ones I\u0027ve committed to long ago.\"\n \"Yeah, yeah,\" I say, sitting up. \"I\u0027ve heard the spiel before. What now, the president of the United States needs you to act as his bodyguard?\"\n \"The Secret Service does that.\"\n \"Then what\u0027s so important?\" I ask him.\n \"I have to go out of town. That\u0027s what the call was about. It can\u0027t be postponed, not this time.\"\n Cool. So I\u0027ll get the condo all to myself? The possibilities are endless.\n \"When?\" I say a little too eagerly.\n \"On Friday morning. I\u0027ll be back on Sunday.\"\n Two whole nights without parental figures! Brighter times are definitely ahead. \"Can I use your car?\"\n \"Only to go to your mother\u0027s house. That\u0027s where you\u0027ll be staying. I just got off the phone with her. You can have my car to drive to her place.\"\n Nope, not okay. \"I am not staying with Mom and Marc. What would I do with Mutt? Besides, I think Marc is allergic to both of us.\"\n \"We\u0027ll put him in a kennel.\"\n I wish he were talking about Marc, but I\u0027m not that lucky. This time I stand up, ready for battle. \"First of all, Mutt and I are a package deal. He is not going to a kennel. Period, end of story.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-7.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: \n How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) \n In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
