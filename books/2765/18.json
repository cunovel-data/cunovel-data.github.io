{"id":85763,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\"Can I have the rest of the week off?\" I ask her. \"I\u0027ll work double the hours next week.\" \"It\u0027s okay with me.\" Jessica has parked herself at a computer terminal when I start wiping down the tables. \"Can you please not tell Avi about my life?\" I ask her. \"Why not?\" \"Because if I want him to know something, I\u0027ll tell him. He doesn\u0027t need to hear it secondhand from my friends.\" Jess cocks her head to the side and says, \"What are you trying to hide from him, Amy?\" \"Nothing.\" Okay, that\u0027s not the honest truth. I\u0027d like to hide the bad parts of me, and only share the awesome parts. You can\u0027t blame me. He\u0027s only here for a week. If he knows I screw up all the time there\u0027s no way he\u0027ll want to be my...non-boyfriend. I\u0027m seriously sick of referring to him as the \"non.\" Something in my life seriously needs to change. 19 Even though the Israeli army is strong I worry about Israel, I pray for the safety of my family living in Israel and my boyfriend who is in the military there. Is there anything I can do to make this a more peaceful world? I\u0027m almost done with my shift at Perk Me Up! when, you guessed it, Nathan comes sauntering in. He walks up to the counter and says, \"Medium green tea with ice, no sweetener.\" He doesn\u0027t even look at me. He\u0027s focused on the sugar packets next to the register. And he\u0027s obviously not interested in sugar packets because he doesn\u0027t like his drinks sweetened. Maria is standing next to me, humming a little tune as she\u0027s purposely trying not to pay attention to the interaction between me and Nathan. When I hand Nathan his drink, he says, \"Where\u0027s Abi?\" \"His name is Avi, and you know it.\" Nathan takes a sip of his cold tea while looking at me above the rim of the cup. When he stops drinking he says, \"Whatever...\" mimicking our previous conversation. \"Did he ditch you already?\" It wouldn\u0027t hurt so bad if it wasn\u0027t so close to the truth. \"No. Can\u0027t you see I\u0027m working?\" \"I\u0027m a customer. I think you\u0027re supposed to be nice to customers.\" I turn to Maria, who is not pretending to ignore our conversation anymore. \"Go on,\" she says. \"Don\u0027t mind me. This is extremely entertaining. I think I might even start charging admission...or start a Perk Me Up! open mic night.\" Taking a deep breath, I shake my head and turn back to Nathan. He\u0027s still standing at the counter. The guy won\u0027t leave. He leans forward and whispers, \"You don\u0027t like me because I\u0027m a geek...dork...lame...weak sauce...whatever you want to label me.\" \"That\u0027s not true,\" I say. \"Oh, yeah? Then why are you so hung up on this Avi dude? Tell me his brain is as big as his biceps.\" \"Not that it\u0027s any of your business, but as a matter of fact he\u0027s really smart. You don\u0027t always have to judge people by their grades. Being fun and outgoing and street-smart is important, too.\" \"If you\u0027re so hung up on the guy, why did you kiss me in the elevator? Oh, that\u0027s right. You did it as a joke.\" \"Did not.\" \"Yeah, right. Plastic girls like you like to play with people\u0027s lives. You never think about the consequences of your actions or who you\u0027ll hurt.\" My mouth goes wide. Is Nathan kidding? I wouldn\u0027t kiss him as a joke, or even a dare. I kissed him because I wanted the upper hand. If he started liking me because of our kiss, I could control our relationship. I could make him hate me or like me. I admit it was manipulative. Nathan\u0027s glasses slip on his nose and he pushes them back up. \"I bet if I acted cool and dressed cool you\u0027d dump that Avi guy and want to date me.\" \"Wanna bet?\" The door to the café opens. It\u0027s Avi. And he doesn\u0027t look happy that I\u0027m talking to Nathan. Nathan must sense my hesitation because he takes his iced tea without sweetener and stomps off to his usual chair to study. Maria taps me on the shoulder. \"You can go, Amy. Your shift is up.\" Thank the Lord. I peel off the yellow apron. I lift myself on my tiptoes and give Avi a huge smooch while wrapping my arms around him. That\u0027ll show him how much I missed him, Nathan how much Avi means to me, and everyone else (including Jessica) how important Avi is in my life. Taking my cue, Avi wraps his arms around me. \"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" he whispers against my mouth, then takes my hand and we leave the café together as a couple. I think the ice has broken between us as we step out into the cold night air. My cell phone rings. It\u0027s my dad. \"Hey, Aba\" I say into my phone. \"Did you get a big surprise today?\" \"Yep. He\u0027s standing right beside me.\" I\u0027ll talk to my dad later about the new \"no surprise rule\" I\u0027m about to set up. \"Let\u0027s all meet for dinner. How about Rosebud?\" Rosebud is an unbelievable Italian place on Rush Street right near our building. On a Saturday night it\u0027s one of the most crowded restaurants in the city. \"Sure.\" \"I\u0027ll be there in a half hour.\" \"Cool. See you there.\" I hang up and hadn\u0027t even realized I was leading Avi away from our building and Rosebud. I notice we\u0027re not holding hands anymore. We\u0027re headed toward the beach even though Lake Michigan is freezing and the wind is blowing hard enough to make my face freeze up, making it hard to talk. \"I thought if I told you I was coming you\u0027d tell me not to,\" Avi says. We\u0027re still walking, both of us looking straight ahead at the lake peeking through the city streets. I want to grab his hand and hold it as we walk, but he\u0027s got both of his fists stuffed inside the front pockets of his jeans. \"I thought you forgot about me,\" I say. He gives a short laugh. \"I didn\u0027t have time, Amy. I was in basic training, remember?\" I\u0027m totally aware that other girls walking past us on the Chicago city streets are checking him out. Will it always be like that? Does he exude that charisma and confidence on purpose? \"What if you did have time, Avi?\" I ask him. \"Would you find someone else, some pretty Israeli girl to replace me?\" \"Why? So you wouldn\u0027t feel guilty starting a relationship with that guy Nathan?\" \"I kissed you in front of him, Avi. Like I\u0027d do that if I liked him.\" \"You did it to make him jealous,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"Did not. Besides, you don\u0027t even want a real relationship. You made that clear last summer. No commitments, no boyfriend/girlfriend stuff. You know what I tell my friends... that you\u0027re my non-boyfriend. Do you know how that makes me feel? Well, I\u0027ll tell you, Mr. Israeli Tough Guy. It makes me feel terrible, like I\u0027m not worth the time or effort or emotion to put into a real relationship.\" I swallow, but it\u0027s not easy because my throat is starting to close up from emotion. Most of the time I try to keep my emotions deep inside, far from the surface. So this sucks, doubly so because it\u0027s Avi, the one person I don\u0027t want to get too emotional with because I know it\u0027ll just push him away. He tries to pull me toward him, but I swat his hand away. I don\u0027t want his sympathy. I want his love. What feels the worst is that I don\u0027t even think he\u0027s capable of giving it. God knows he\u0027d never say it. \"I don\u0027t know what you want,\" he says, totally frustrated now. \"Amy, I\u0027m sorry. I thought we had this all worked out. \"Yeah, well, we don\u0027t. Why did you come here? Just to screw around with my life?\" \"No,\" he says, pulling me into his chest and this time doesn\u0027t let me resist. Holding me tight, he whispers into my hair, \"I finished combat basic training and am assigned to a specialized fighting unit. The IDF is taking a different approach to terrorism; they\u0027re going to teach us how to think, act, and be the enemy.\" He takes a deep breath and says, \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll get authorization to contact you in the summer when you visit.\" 20 Jacob had twelve sons. Each became one of the twelve tribes of Israel (Numbers 1:4). I wonder what tribe my descendants are from. I\u0027m sure the Internet doesn\u0027t track birth records from that far back. It takes a few minutes for me to comprehend what Avi just told me. Specialized fighting unit. Being the enemy. I pull back and look into his eyes. \"We\u0027re supposed to see each other next summer when I come to visit. You promised me.\" \"I got time off now instead.\" \"Where are you going to be living in the summer?\" Avi gives me a small smile. \"I\u0027ll be traveling a lot.\" \"In the Middle East?\" I ask. \"Yes. And Europe.\" \"I don\u0027t like that,\" I tell him. \"Not one bit.\" Taking a look at my watch, I realize we better head to Rosebud or my dad will be worried. \"My dad\u0027s meeting us for dinner,\" I tell Avi, then start walking but I feel like I\u0027m in a trance. Avi takes his place right next to me. \"Did I freak you out?\" he asks. \"Yep.\" Totally freaked me out. All these thoughts are running through my head, especially the ones where men are captured and tortured and mutilated. I mean, it\u0027s inhumane what\u0027s going on in the world. I seriously like my life right here, as safe as I could be in a big city like Chicago. I\u0027m silent the rest of the walk to Rosebud. My dad is already there, sitting and waiting at a table. He waves us over and stands up to shake Avi\u0027s hand and to pat him on the back. Does my dad know? Does he have any idea Avi is about to risk his life for Israel just like he did at Avi\u0027s age? I roll my eyes as they immediately start speaking in Hebrew, strange words and sounds pouring out of their mouths super fast. My phone vibrates with a text message. I read it under the table. Jess: Where did you run off to? Me: Dinner Jess: Avi ok? Me: Yep. Jess: Does he know you XOXOed Nathan? Me: NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The waitress is standing over to our table, but the guys are oblivious. \"I\u0027ll have a Coke,\" I tell her. \"No ice. No lemon.\" There\u0027s nothing worse than watered-down Coke. \"Got it. And for the gentlemen?\" The gentlemen are gurgling and gargling their way through a very intense conversation. They\u0027re probably talking about Avi\u0027s army training because my dad is totally concentrated and impressed with whatever Avi\u0027s talking about. Boys and their gun talk... I just want to forget about guns and army and elite forces these next seven days. I\u0027m going to treat his military service as if it doesn\u0027t exist. Ignorance keeps me sane sometimes. \"When you\u0027re ready to speak English, just wake me up,\" I say, then lay my head down on the table. \"Sorry, sweetheart,\" my dad says. \"I was just telling Avi your mom is pregnant.\" \"Thanks, Aba\" I tell him sarcastically. \"I\u0027m sure I couldn\u0027t have told him that myself.\" I don\u0027t understand why everyone in my life just can\u0027t keep their mouths shut. As my temperature is rising and my heart is pounding, I feel Avi\u0027s hand reach under the table for mine. As soon as our fingers touch, I take a calming breath. It\u0027s as if Avi knew I was starting to panic about everything. He gets big brownie points for this. Even though I\u0027m usually carb-conscious, I can\u0027t resist the warm bread at Rosebud. The loaf is crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Taking the jug of olive oil, I pour some of the golden liquid onto my little appetizer plate and spoon parmesan cheese on top.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-18.html","bookId":2765,"book":{"id":2765,"title":"How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin My Teenage Life (How to Ruin #2) In this sequel to How to Ruin a Summer Vacation, EVERYTHING in sixteen-year-old Amy Nelson Barak\u0027s life is going wrong!
