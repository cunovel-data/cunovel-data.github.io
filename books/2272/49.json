Hopefully no one will ever tell her that.\\n\\n Barbara had extracted the arsenic that killed Thorne from rat poison. As a librarian, she had Internet access and lots of time to read, and the method wasn’t hard to come by.\\n\\n Larry Levine finally wrote a book. It was on the Poe Killings, and it was published by Brook Avery, in his first venture into book publishing. It was not only well-reviewed, it was a bestseller.\\n\\n Don Tracy is scheduled to perform as Albee Bennet in an adaptation of the book that’s coming to Broadway. It’s going to be a musical. Go figure. It might be a short run. Then again, who knows?\\n\\n Nat Halloway, executor of Thorne Bigelow’s will, filed all the papers and did all the work. The New York Poe Society received a huge endowment. Jared, who inherited the bulk of the money, married Mary. She’s still a closet drunk and a bit of a bitch. Which is sort of ironic and actually okay. They deserve each other.\\n\\n At first Genevieve and Joe talked about running away to Vegas and doing something fun, like an Elvis wedding. But they both adore Eileen and didn’t want to cheat her out of her chance to play mother of the bride, so instead they were married at St. Patrick’s in a huge affair.

Now a new menace is stalking the streets of New York. \\n The media is buzzing about the Poe Killings, a string of homicides mirroring the author\u0027s macabre stories. Almost without exception, the victims have been members of a literary society devoted to the master of crime fiction--and Genevieve s own mother may be next. \\n Spooked by the bizarre slayings, Genevieve turns to PI Joe Connolly, her rescuer, her friend and...?
