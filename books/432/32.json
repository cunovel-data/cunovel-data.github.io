{"id":11965,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII. THE BOYS IMPRISONED.","content":"\"Now sit down and tell me all about it, Clip,\" said Bob. \"So you were told my leg was broke. Who told you?\" \"De two men.\" \"I think I know the two men. One of them brought you here. Where is the other?\" \"He stayed on board the boat till we come back.\" \"Was there anything said about our going back?\" asked Bob, in surprise. \"Yes, Massa Bob. Dey said you leg was broke, and you wanted me to come for you. De man said we would take you back with us.\" \"Clip,\" said Bob, sadly, \"these men deceived you. We are in a trap.\" \"What\u0027s dat?\" \"They have made us prisoners, and I don\u0027t dare to think what they will do next.\"[Pg 278] \"Dey won\u0027t \u0027sassinate us?\" asked Clip, who had picked up the word somewhere. \"No; but I\u0027ll tell you what I think they will do. They will take the boat down the river, and sell the grain in St. Louis, and run off with the money.\" This was the conclusion to which Bob was led by Clip\u0027s story. \"We won\u0027t let \u0027em, Massa Bob,\" said Clip, in excitement. \"How shall we help it, Clip?\" \"We must get out, and run away.\" \"I wish I knew how,\" said Bob. \"If we can get out, we\u0027ll take a boat to the city, and git there ahead of \u0027em.\" Somehow Clip\u0027s words seemed to reassure Bob. Misery loves company, and the presence of his trusty friend and servant perceptibly lightened Bob\u0027s spirits. \"You are right, Clip,\" he said. \"To-morrow we will see what we can do. We can\u0027t do anything to-night.\" \"Who is de little girl, Massa Bob?\" asked Clip, suddenly. \"What little girl?\"[Pg 279] \"Haven\u0027t you seen her? De little girl downstairs.\" \"I haven\u0027t seen her. Tell me about her.\" Clip described her as well as he could, and succeeded in conveying to Bob a general idea of her appearance, and that of the woman who had charge of her. Bob listened, thoughtfully. \"You don\u0027t think the little girl was any relation to the woman, Clip?\" he said. \"No, Massa Bob; no more\u0027n you is relation to me. De girl was a little lady, and de woman was awful ugly.\" \"Did the little girl say anything in your hearing?\" \"She asked to be taken back to her fader.\" Suddenly there came into Bob\u0027s mind the story about a little girl abducted from St. Louis. \"Clip,\" he said, \"I think the little girl has been stolen from her home. I think it is the same one we heard about the other day.\" \"I pity de poor girl. De ol\u0027 woman shook her, and treated her bad.\" \"If we could only run away from this place[Pg 280] and take the little girl with us, it would be a capital idea. I would like to get her away from these wretches.\" \"I\u0027m wid you, Massa Bob,\" said Clip, enthusiastically. \"Hush!\" said Bob, suddenly raising his finger. A little girl\u0027s voice was heard, and it was easy to judge that she was ascending the stairs. Bob put his ear to the keyhole. \"Take me home to my papa!\" said the poor child. \"I don\u0027t want to stay here.\" \"I\u0027ll whip you,\" said a harsh voice, \"if you are not good. It\u0027s time little girls were a-bed. I\u0027m going to put you to bed, and you can sleep till morning.\" \"I don\u0027t want to go to bed.\" There was a little scream, for the woman had slapped her. \"I\u0027d like to get at that woman, Clip,\" said Bob, indignantly. They heard the door open—the door of the room adjoining. The partition was very thin, and it was easy[Pg 281] to hear what was going on. Not only this, but Clip discovered an auger hole about eighteen inches above the floor, of sufficient size to enable him to look through it. \"Who was that black boy?\" he heard the little girl say. \"He\u0027s a funny-looking boy.\" \"He\u0027s come to stay here with the other boy,\" answered the woman, glad to find something of interest to take the place of the complaints. \"Where are they?\" asked the girl. \"They are sleeping in the next room, so you need not be afraid if I go down and leave you.\" \"May I play with them to-morrow?\" \"Yes, if you will be a good girl,\" said the woman, willing to promise anything. Then there was a little pause, spent in undressing the child. \"Now, get into bed, and go to sleep as soon as you can.\" \"Will you take me to my papa to-morrow?\" \"No,\" answered the woman, shortly. \"Your papa wants you to stay with me.\"[Pg 282] \"Won\u0027t I never see my papa again?\" asked the child, almost ready to cry. \"Yes; perhaps he\u0027ll come to see you next week,\" answered the woman, fearing that the child might sob and compel her to remain upstairs. \"Clip,\" said Bob, who had taken Clip\u0027s place at the hole in the partition, \"there\u0027s no doubt of it. The girl has been stolen. I wish I could go into the room, and asked her about her father and her home.\" He went to the door and tried it, but it was firmly locked, and it was quite useless to try to get out. Meanwhile, Joe and his wife were conversing downstairs. \"Joe,\" said the woman, \"I hope I\u0027ll get rid of that brat soon. She\u0027s a heap of trouble.\" \"We shall be well paid,\" said Joe. \"Who\u0027s to pay us?\" asked the woman. \"Brown. He\u0027s the man that\u0027s got charge of the job. She\u0027s got a rich father, who\u0027ll shell out liberal to get her back.\" \"Did he pay you anything in advance?\" \"I squeezed five dollars out of him.\"[Pg 283] \"Where is it, Joe?\" \"Don\u0027t you wish you knew, old woman?\" said Joe, with a grin. \"I can take care of it.\" \"Half of it belongs to me.\" \"How do you make that out?\" \"Haven\u0027t I the care of the child? It don\u0027t trouble you.\" \"It\u0027s all right, old lady. You won\u0027t be forgotten.\" \"How much more is Brown to pay you?\" asked the woman, appearing dissatisfied. \"Forty-five dollars.\" The woman\u0027s eyes sparkled. To her this seemed a vast sum of money. \"And how much am I to have?\" \"What do you want money for?\" demanded Joe, impatiently. \"I do want it, and that\u0027s enough.\" \"Well, I can\u0027t say yet, old lady, but maybe you\u0027ll get ten dollars.\" \"Altogether?\" \"Of course. Ain\u0027t that enough?\" \"No, it isn\u0027t. We ought to divide even.\" \"Pooh, you\u0027re a woman. You don\u0027t need money.\"[Pg 284] An unpleasant look came over the woman\u0027s face, but she said nothing. \"Come, old woman, I\u0027ve got something that\u0027ll put you into good humor. See here!\" Joe produced from an out-of-the-way corner a suspicious-looking jug. \"Do you know what\u0027s in this?\" \"What is it?\" asked the woman, looking interested. \"Whisky. Get some boiling water, and I\u0027ll make you some punch. We\u0027ll make a night of it.\" His wife brightened up. Evidently she did not belong to the Temperance Society, any more than her husband. She moved about the room with alacrity, and, assisted by her husband, brewed a punch which was of considerable strength. Then they put it on the table, and set about enjoying themselves. \"Here\u0027s your health, ol\u0027 woman!\" said Joe, and he tried to sing a stave of an old drinking-song. Together they caroused till a late hour, and then fell into a drunken sleep, which lasted till a late hour in the morning.[Pg 285] About seven o\u0027clock the little girl woke up, and, as is usual with children, wished to be dressed at once. \"Aunt,\" Bob heard her say, \"I want to be dressed.\" But no one came at her call. After a little waiting, she got out of bed and went downstairs, but returned in a minute or two, crying. Bob called through the partition. \"What\u0027s the matter, little girl?\" \"There\u0027s nobody to dress me. Are you the boy that came yesterday?\" \"Yes. Where is the woman that put you to bed?\" \"She\u0027s downstairs—she and the man. They\u0027re lying on the floor. I can\u0027t wake them up.\" An idea came to Bob. \"Come to our door, little girl, and see if you can draw back the bolt. We are fastened in.\" \"Will you take me to my papa?\" \"Yes; I will try to.\" The child came to the door, and, following[Pg 286] Bob\u0027s directions, with some difficulty slipped back the bolt. \"Clip,\" said Bob, in a tone of triumph, \"We\u0027re free. Now do as I tell you, and we\u0027ll get away, and reach St. Louis ahead of the boat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2957/81341.html","bookId":432,"book":{"id":432,"title":"Bob Burton or The Young Ranchman of the Missouri","description":"简介： Clip, as may be inferred, was a negro boy, now turned of fourteen, who for four years had been attached to the service of Richard Burton, a ranchman, whose farm lay on a small stream tributary to the Missouri, in the fertile State of Iowa.
