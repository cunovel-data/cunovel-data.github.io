{"id":11938,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. WOLVERTON\u0027S FIRST MOVE.","content":"Why did not Aaron Wolverton burn the receipt, and get rid once for all of the only proof that the interest had been paid? It would have been the most politic thing to do, inasmuch as he had made up his mind to be dishonest. But, though unprincipled, he was not a bold man. The thought did certainly occur to him, and he even went so far as to light a match. But more timid counsel prevailed, and he concealed it in his desk, carefully locking the desk afterwards. It is unnecessary to describe the grief of the little family at Burton\u0027s Ranch when the body of the master was brought home. No one had dreamed of speedy death for Richard Burton. He seemed so strong and vigorous that it would have seemed safe to predict for him a long life—long beyond the average; yet[Pg 43] here, in middle life, in the fullness of health and vigor, the summons had come. To Mrs. Burton, who was a most devoted wife, it was a crushing blow. It seemed at first as if it would be happiness to lie down beside her dead husband, and leave the world for him. \"What have I to live for now?\" she asked, mournfully. \"You have me, mother,\" answered Bob, gently. \"I have lost my father. What would become of me if I should lose my mother also?\" \"You are right, Robert,\" said Mrs. Burton. \"I was wrong to give way; but it is a very hard trial.\" \"Indeed it is, mother,\" said Robert, kissing her affectionately. \"But we must try to bear up.\" Mrs. Burton felt that this was her plain duty, and henceforth strove to control her emotions. She ceased to sob, but her face showed the grief she suffered. The funeral took place, and the little family held a council to decide what was to be done.[Pg 44] \"Can we carry on the ranch now that your father is gone?\" asked Mrs. Burton, anxiously. \"Would it not be better to sell it?\" \"No, mother; the sacrifice would be too great.\" \"But I do not feel capable of managing it, Robert.\" \"You may think me presumptuous, mother, but my proposal is to assist you, relieving you of the greater part of the care. Between us we can carry it on, I am confident.\" \"You are only a boy of sixteen, Robert,\" objected his mother. \"That is true; but I have watched carefully the manner in which the ranch has been carried on. Of course you must help, and you will try to get a man with whom I can advise. I am sure we can make a good deal more out of the farm than we could realize from investing the money it would bring.\" \"And are you willing to undertake this, Robert? It will be a hard task.\" \"I\u0027ll help him, missis,\" said Clip, eagerly. \"I shall have Clip to advise me, mother,\" said Robert.[Pg 45] \"No doubt Clip is willing,\" said Mrs. Burton, smiling faintly; \"but after all, it will be only two boys.\" \"Try us a single year, mother,\" said Bob, confidently. Mrs. Burton gave her consent, and Bob at once took his father\u0027s place, rising early and going to the field to superintend the farming operations. He seemed to have developed at once into a mature man, though in appearance he was still the same. Clip was his loyal assistant, though, being a harum-scarum boy, fond of fun and mischief, he was of very little service as adviser. He had mentioned to Bob seeing Aaron Wolverton bending over the body of his father, and exploring his pockets. This puzzled Bob, but he was not prepared to suspect him of anything else than curiosity, until his mother received a call from the real estate agent a month after her husband\u0027s decease. Aaron Wolverton had been anxious to call before, but something withheld him. It might have been the consciousness of the dishonorable course he had taken. Be that as it may,[Pg 46] he finally screwed up his courage to the sticking-point, and walked out to Burton\u0027s Ranch early one afternoon. Mrs. Burton was at home, as usual, for she seldom went out now. She had no intimate friends in the neighborhood. All that she cared for was under her own roof. She looked up in some surprise when Mr. Wolverton was ushered into the sitting-room. \"I hope I see you well, Mrs. Burton,\" said the real estate agent, slipping to a seat, and placing his high hat on his knees. \"I am well in health, Mr. Wolverton,\" answered the widow, gravely. \"Yes, yes, of course; I understand,\" he hastily answered. \"Terribly sudden, Mr. Barton\u0027s death was, to be sure, but dust we are, and to dust we must return, as the Scripture says.\" Mrs. Burton did not think it necessary to make any reply. \"I came over to offer my—my condolences,\" continued Mr. Wolverton. \"Thank you.\"[Pg 47] \"And I thought perhaps you might stand in need of some advice from a practical man.\" \"Any advice will be considered, Mr. Wolverton.\" \"I\u0027ve been thinkin\u0027 the thing over, and I\u0027ve about made up my mind that the best thing you can do is to sell the ranch,\" and the real estate agent squinted at Mrs. Burton from under his red eyebrows. \"That was my first thought; but I consulted with Robert, and he was anxious to have me carry on the ranch with his help.\" Aaron Wolverton shook his head. \"A foolish plan!\" he remarked. \"Excuse me for saying so. Of course you, being a woman, are not competent to carry it on—\" \"I have my son Robert to help me,\" said the widow. Aaron Wolverton sniffed contemptuously. \"A mere boy!\" he ejaculated. \"No; not a mere boy. His father\u0027s death and his affection for me have made a man of him at sixteen. He rises early every morning, goes to the fields, and superintends the [Pg 48]farming operations. Peter, my head man, says that he is a remarkably smart boy, and understands the business about as well as a man.\" \"Still I predict that he\u0027ll bring you deeper in debt every year.\" \"I don\u0027t think so; but, at any rate, I have promised to try the experiment for one year. I can then tell better whether it will be wise to keep on or sell.\" \"Now, Mrs. Burton, I have a better plan to suggest.\" \"What is it, Mr. Wolverton?\" \"In fact, I have two plans. One is that you should sell me the ranch. You know I hold a mortgage on it for three thousand dollars?\" \"I know it, Mr. Wolverton!\" answered the widow, gravely. \"I\u0027ll give you three thousand dollars over and above, and then you will be rid of all care.\" \"Will you explain to me how Robert and I are going to live on the interest of three thousand dollars, Mr. Wolverton?\"[Pg 49] \"You\u0027ll get something, and if the boy runs the ranch you\u0027ll get nothing. He can earn his living, and I don\u0027t think you will suffer, even if you have only three thousand dollars.\" \"It is quite out of the question. Mr. Burton considered the ranch worth ten thousand dollars.\" \"A very ridiculous over-valuation—pardon me for saying so.\" \"At any rate, I don\u0027t propose to sell.\" \"There\u0027s another little circumstance I ought to mention,\" added Wolverton, nervously. \"There is half a year\u0027s interest due on the mortgage. It was due on the very day of your husband\u0027s death.\" Mrs. Burton looked up in amazement. \"What do you mean, Mr. Wolverton?\" she said. \"My husband started for your office on the fatal morning of his death, carrying the money—one hundred and fifty dollars—to meet the interest. Do you mean to tell me that he did not pay it?\" \"That is strange, very strange,\" stammered Aaron Wolverton, wiping his forehead with a[Pg 50] bandana handkerchief. \"What became of the money?\" \"Do you mean to say that it was not paid to you?\" asked the widow, sharply. \"No, it was not,\" answered Wolverton, with audacious falsehood. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2957/81314.html","bookId":432,"book":{"id":432,"title":"Bob Burton or The Young Ranchman of the Missouri","description":"简介： Clip, as may be inferred, was a negro boy, now turned of fourteen, who for four years had been attached to the service of Richard Burton, a ranchman, whose farm lay on a small stream tributary to the Missouri, in the fertile State of Iowa.
