{"id":11969,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVI. A THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD.","content":"A little awed by the splendid appointments of the merchant\u0027s house, Bob and Clip entered, following Mr. Pearson. A stout, pleasant-looking woman of middle age—the housekeeper—appeared at the door of a side room. She darted forward, and clasped Maud in a fond embrace. \"My darling Maud, how glad I am to see you back!\" she said. \"I thought we had lost you.\" \"This is the young man who rescued Maud, Margaret,\" said Mr. Pearson, pointing to Bob. \"And he so young! I must kiss him, too!\" said Margaret; and, considerably to our hero\u0027s embarrassment, Margaret gave him a resounding kiss. \"This boy also assisted,\" said Mr. Pearson, indicating Clip, with a smile.[Pg 309] Margaret hesitated a moment—she was not quite prepared to kiss a colored boy—but compromised by shaking his hand cordially. \"You look like a nice boy, Clip,\" she said. \"So I is, missus; yah, yah!\" responded Clip, laughing. \"Now, Margaret, can you give us something to eat?\" said Mr. Pearson. \"It\u0027s all ready, sir. I thought you and Miss Maud would be hungry.\" \"I suspect we are all hungry,\" said Mr. Pearson, leading the way into a handsome dining-room. \"Now, boys, take your seats,\" he said. Clip felt a little awkward, for he was not used to being a guest at a rich man\u0027s table, but he did not allow his bashfulness to interfere with the gratification of an excellent appetite. When the meal was over, Mr. Pearson invited the boys into his library, and seated himself at a desk. He drew a check-book from a drawer and wrote for a minute. Then he tore off a check, and handed it to Bob. \"This is the reward I offered for the return[Pg 310] of my dear daughter,\" he said. \"I have made the check payable to your order.\" Bob took it and read as follows: \"First National Bank, \"Pay to the order of Robert Burton, One Thousand Dollars. \"$1000. John Pearson.\" \"I don\u0027t like to take this large sum, Mr. Pearson,\" said Bob. \"I did not rescue your daughter for money.\" \"I am quite aware of that, my dear boy, but it is a pleasure for me to give you this proof of my gratitude. I am sure you will spend it creditably.\" \"I shall find it very useful, sir; and I thank you sincerely. May I ask if you do not deal in wheat?\" \"That is a part of my business.\" \"I shall have about fourteen hundred bushels to dispose of if I recover my boat.\" \"I will give you two dollars and a quarter a bushel, if it is in good condition.\" \"I accept, sir,\" answered Bob, promptly.[Pg 311] \"Now, may I ask your advice as to how to proceed to regain possession of the boat?\" \"When do you expect it to arrive?\" asked the merchant. \"Probably not till to-morrow, but I can\u0027t guess at what part of the day. It depends on how well the thieves succeed in managing the boat.\" \"I will order my carriage and drive round with you to the Central Police Office. The police will take proper measures to recover the boat and arrest the rascals who robbed you of it.\" \"Won\u0027t it be too much trouble, sir?\" \"I shall not count it a trouble, for I shall at the same time be punishing the men who abducted my dear Maud. They will be tried for both offenses, and will probably get a long term of imprisonment.\" In an hour information had been lodged at the Central Police Office, and orders had been given to watch the river, and to keep a good lookout for the boat, of which Bob furnished a description. That night Bob and Clip slept at Mr. Pearson\u0027s house, being treated as honored guests. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2957/81345.html","bookId":432,"book":{"id":432,"title":"Bob Burton or The Young Ranchman of the Missouri","description":"简介： Clip, as may be inferred, was a negro boy, now turned of fourteen, who for four years had been attached to the service of Richard Burton, a ranchman, whose farm lay on a small stream tributary to the Missouri, in the fertile State of Iowa.
