{"id":11972,"no":39,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIX. CONCLUSION.","content":"There was another arrival at Burton\u0027s Ranch the next day. Sam Wolverton came in charge of his new-found relative, Robert Granger. They took a carriage, and reached the ranch without attracting the attention of Aaron Wolverton. Mrs. Burton welcomed her visitors, and expressed great pleasure at the discovery that Sam\u0027s fortunes were likely to be improved. Mr. Granger proposed to make a call upon the faithless guardian, but was saved the necessity, as Mr. Wolverton called early in the afternoon of the same day. He was in a hurry to show his power, and foreclose the mortgage. It was arranged that Sam and Mr. Granger should remain out of sight at first. Robert answered the knock at the door. \"Is your mother at home?\" asked Wolverton.[Pg 325] \"Yes, sir; will you walk in?\" \"I believe I will.\" He entered the sitting-room, and Mrs. Burton soon made her appearance. \"I see your son has returned, widder,\" remarked the agent. \"Yes; it seems pleasant to have him back. I missed him greatly.\" \"Humph! I s\u0027pose so. It\u0027s a pity he went at all.\" \"I don\u0027t know that.\" \"Why, it stands to reason,\" said Wolverton, impatiently. \"He went on a fool\u0027s errand.\" \"What makes you say that?\" \"He might have known a boy like him couldn\u0027t succeed in such an enterprise. If he had taken up with my offer, he would have been all right.\" \"He said you offered him much less than the market price.\" \"And so he started off to do better, and lost his whole cargo,\" sneered Wolverton, smiling unpleasantly. Mrs. Burton was silent.[Pg 326] \"I came to tell you that I should require not only the interest, but a payment of half the mortgage, according to the conditions. It is due next Saturday.\" \"Won\u0027t you wait, under the circumstances, Mr. Wolverton?\" \"No; I will not.\" \"Do you think that is kind?\" asked Mrs. Burton. \"Kindness is kindness, and business is business, Mrs. Burton. Still, I am willing to spare you on one condition.\" \"What is that?\" \"That you become Mrs. Wolverton.\" Mrs. Burton made a gesture of repulsion. \"That is entirely out of the question,\" she said. \"Then I shall show no mercy.\" Mrs. Burton went to the door and called \"Robert.\" Bob entered. \"Mr. Wolverton demands his interest and the payment of half the mortgage, according to the terms.\" \"It is not due yet.\"[Pg 327] \"It will be, next Saturday,\" said the agent, triumphantly. \"And I won\u0027t listen to any palaver or any entreaties to put off the payment. As you have made your bed you can lie upon it.\" \"What do you propose to do if we don\u0027t pay?\" asked Bob. \"Foreclose the mortgage!\" exclaimed the agent, bringing down his fist upon the table before him. \"In that case, I think, mother, we will pay,\" said Bob, quietly. \"You can\u0027t pay!\" snarled Wolverton. \"That is where you are mistaken, Mr. Wolverton. I will not only pay what you ask, but I am ready to take up the whole mortgage.\" \"Is the boy crazy?\" ejaculated Wolverton. \"Not that I am aware of,\" answered Bob, smiling. \"You haven\u0027t got the money.\" \"Mistaken again, Mr. Wolverton.\" \"When did you get it?\" gasped Wolverton. \"Wasn\u0027t your cargo stolen?\" \"Yes, by emissaries of yours!\" was Bob\u0027s unexpected reply; \"but I recovered it, and[Pg 328] sold the grain for two dollars and a quarter a bushel.\" \"You recovered it?\" said Wolverton, turning pale. \"Yes; and the men that stole it are now in jail. I have a letter from one of them, declaring that he was employed by you.\" \"It\u0027s a lie!\" hastily exclaimed the agent; but he looked frightened. \"I have reason to believe it is true. Mr. Wolverton, your base conspiracy failed.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll go,\" said Wolverton, rising. He wanted time to think. \"Not just yet! Here are two persons who wish to see you\"; and, to Wolverton\u0027s surprise, Sam and Robert Granger entered the room. \"You didn\u0027t expect to see me, Aaron Wolverton,\" said Captain Granger. \"I have come here with your nephew to demand restitution of the property which you have appropriated to your own use, giving him to understand that he was living on charity.\" Wolverton looked like a man in a state of collapse. He didn\u0027t dare to deny what he[Pg 329] knew Captain Granger would have no difficulty in proving. He glared at Sam as if he would like to have him in his power for a short time. \"Are you coming back with me?\" he asked. \"I will answer for him,\" said Captain Granger. \"Sam is of an age when the law authorizes him to select his own guardian. I have accepted the trust, and I demand the transfer of his property to me.\" If there had been any chance of success, Wolverton would have contested the matter, and, as it was, he interposed all the obstacles in his power. Finally, Sam got his own, however, much to Wolverton\u0027s disappointment. Five years have passed. The mortgage on Burton\u0027s Ranch has long since been paid, and Bob is making a handsome profit every year for his mother and himself. Clip is still a member of the family, and, though he cannot be called a model of industry, he is a favorite through his good nature and love of fun. He is thoroughly loyal to the Burtons, and hates Wolverton as much as it is in his nature to[Pg 330] hate anybody. Wolverton is getting worse in temper as he grows older, and his ill-gotten gains do not bring him happiness. The sight of Bob\u0027s prosperity is gall and wormwood to him; but for this Bob cares little. Sam is employed in a store under his new guardian\u0027s charge, but every summer he comes to Burton\u0027s Ranch and stays a month, where he, Bob, and Clip have fine times. Mrs. Burton is happy in her prosperity, and is thankful to God for having given her so good a son. Bob has made more than one trip down the river, but none so eventful as the one described in this story. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2957/81348.html","bookId":432,"book":{"id":432,"title":"Bob Burton or The Young Ranchman of the Missouri","description":"简介： Clip, as may be inferred, was a negro boy, now turned of fourteen, who for four years had been attached to the service of Richard Burton, a ranchman, whose farm lay on a small stream tributary to the Missouri, in the fertile State of Iowa.
