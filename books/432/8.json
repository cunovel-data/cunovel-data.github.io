{"id":11941,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. WOLVERTON\u0027S DISMAY.","content":"Wolverton uttered a cry of dismay when he found that the receipt had disappeared. With trembling fingers he turned over a pile of papers in the hope of finding the important paper. \"Where on earth can it be?\" he asked himself, with a troubled face. He set himself to consider when he had seen it last and where he had placed it. \"It must be in the desk somewhere,\" he decided, and resumed his search. Those of my readers who have mislaid any article can picture to themselves his increasing perplexity as the missing paper failed to turn up. He was finally obliged to conclude that it was not in the desk. But, if so, where could it be? If not found, or if found by any one else, his situation would be an embarrassing[Pg 70] one. He had assured Mrs. Burton that the interest money had not been paid. Now suppose the receipt were found, what would be the inference? He could not help acknowledging that it would look bad for him. Until he learned something of its whereabouts he would not dare to press Mrs. Burton for a second payment of the interest money. \"It is as bad as losing a hundred and fifty dollars,\" he groaned. \"It is a pile of money to lose.\" Aaron Wolverton did not appear to consider that it was losing what was not his property, and was only preventing him from pushing a fraudulent claim. He actually felt wronged by this inopportune loss. He felt somehow that he was the victim of misfortune. But what could have become of the receipt? That was what troubled him. Was there anybody who was responsible for its disappearance? Naturally it would be important for Mrs. Burton to get hold of it; but then, they did not know of its existence. They had no evidence that the receipt had even been delivered to Richard Burton. Still it was possible[Pg 71] that Bob Burton had visited the house, and searched the desk. He would inquire of his sister. He opened the door leading to the kitchen, where Miss Sally Wolverton was engaged in some domestic employment. \"Sally, has the Burton boy been here this morning?\" \"No; why should he come? He isn\u0027t one of your visitors, is he?\" \"Was he here yesterday?\" \"No; what makes you ask?\" \"There was a little business, connected with the farm, which he might have come about.\" \"I am glad he didn\u0027t come,\" said Sally. \"He\u0027s too high-strung for me.\" \"I don\u0027t like him myself; but sometimes we have to do business with those we don\u0027t like.\" \"That\u0027s so. How\u0027s the widder left?\" \"She\u0027s got the ranch, but I hold a mortgage of three thousand dollars on it,\" replied her brother, his features expanding into a wintry smile. A man who can laugh heartily possesses redeeming traits, even if in some respects[Pg 72] he is bad; but Aaron Wolverton had never been known to indulge in a hearty laugh. \"Can she pay?\" \"Not at present.\" \"Is the mortgage for a term of years?\" \"No; it can be called in at the end of any year.\" \"I never liked that woman,\" said Miss Sally Wolverton, grimly. Sally Wolverton did not like any woman who was younger and prettier than herself, and there were few who were not prettier. She had never known of her brother\u0027s infatuation for the lady she was criticising, otherwise she would have been tempted to express herself even more strongly. She was strongly opposed to his marriage, as this would have removed her from her place in his household, or, even if she remained, would have deprived her of her power. Aaron did not care at present to take her into his confidence. Still he could not forbear coming, in a faint way, to the defense of the woman he admired. \"Mrs. Burton is a fine-looking woman,\" he said.[Pg 73] \"Fine looking!\" repeated Sally with a contemptuous sniff. \"I don\u0027t admire your taste.\" \"She isn\u0027t in your style, Sally,\" said Aaron, with a sly twinkle in his eye. Sally Wolverton was taller than her brother, with harsh features, a gaunt, angular figure, and an acid expression. \"I hope not,\" she answered. \"I hope I don\u0027t look like an insipid doll.\" \"You certainly don\u0027t, Sally; you have expression enough, I am sure.\" \"Do you think Mrs. Burton pretty?\" asked Sally, suspiciously. \"Oh, so so!\" answered Aaron, guardedly; for he did not care to reveal the secret to his sister at present. She was useful to him as a housekeeper, and moreover (an important point) she was very economical; more so than any person whom he could hire. He did indeed pay his sister, but only a dollar a week, and out of this she saved nearly one half, having the gift of economy in quite as large a measure as himself. This assurance, and her brother\u0027s indifferent tone, relieved Sally from her momentary [Pg 74]suspicion. Yet, had she been able to read her brother\u0027s secret thoughts, she would have been a prey to anxiety. He had made up his mind, if ever he did marry Mrs. Burton, to give Sally her walking-ticket. \"I can\u0027t afford to support two women,\" he reflected, \"and my wife ought to be able to do all the work in so small a household.\" \"Why are you so anxious to know whether any of the Burtons have been here?\" \"I thought they might come,\" answered her brother, evasively. \"You haven\u0027t seen anything of that black imp, Clip, have you?\" \"No; has he any business with you?\" \"I have some business with him,\" snarled Wolverton. \"He played a trick on me this morning.\" \"What sort of a trick?\" \"I got him to carry me across the creek in his boat, and he managed to upset me.\" \"Did he do it a-purpose?\" \"Yes; he laughed like a hyena when he saw me floundering in the water.\" \"If he comes round here, I\u0027ll give him a lesson. I can\u0027t abide a nigger any way.[Pg 75] They\u0027re as lazy as sin, and they ain\u0027t got no more sense than a monkey. It\u0027s my opinion they are a kind of monkey, any way.\" Fortunately for the colored race all are not so prejudiced against them as Sally Wolverton—otherwise they would be in a bad case. \"By the way, Sally, have you seen a stray paper about the floor in my room?\" asked Wolverton, with assumed carelessness. \"What sort of a paper was it?\" \"It was a—a receipt,\" answered her brother, hesitating. \"What kind of a receipt—from whom?\" asked Sally, who possessed her share of general curiosity. \"That isn\u0027t to the point. If you have seen such a paper, or picked it up, I shall feel relieved. I might have to pay the money over again if I don\u0027t find it.\" This was misrepresenting the matter, but Wolverton did not think it expedient to give his sister a clew to so delicate a secret. \"No; I have seen no paper,\" she said shortly, not relishing his evasive reply. \"Have you searched your desk?\"[Pg 76] \"Yes.\" \"And didn\u0027t find it?\" \"No.\" \"Suppose I look. Four eyes are better than two.\" \"No, thank you, Sally,\" answered her brother, hastily. \"I am particular about not having my papers disturbed.\" Aaron Wolverton would have gained some valuable information touching the missing paper if he could have transferred himself at that moment to Burton\u0027s Ranch. Bob and Clip were out in the yard when Sam Wolverton made his appearance, breathless and excited. \"What\u0027s the matter, Sam?\" asked Bob, wondering. \"Let me catch my breath,\" gasped Sam. \"I—I\u0027ve got some good news.\" \"Then you are welcome. Has your uncle got married?\" \"No; nor aunt Sally either,\" replied Sam. \"What do you say to that?\" and he drew from his vest pocket a long strip of paper. \"What\u0027s that?\" asked Bob, eagerly. \"It\u0027s the receipt\", answered Sam. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2957/81317.html","bookId":432,"book":{"id":432,"title":"Bob Burton or The Young Ranchman of the Missouri","description":"简介： Clip, as may be inferred, was a negro boy, now turned of fourteen, who for four years had been attached to the service of Richard Burton, a ranchman, whose farm lay on a small stream tributary to the Missouri, in the fertile State of Iowa.
