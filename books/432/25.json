{"id":11958,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. CLIP\u0027S SECRET MISSION.","content":"The man who had addressed Bob eyed him sharply on receiving his negative answer. \"It is a pretty serious thing to connive at the escape of a criminal,\" he said. \"That remark does not affect me, sir. I know nothing of any criminal. If I had seen him I would tell you.\" Bob talked so frankly and honestly that it seemed impossible to doubt his word. The leader of the pursuing party turned to consult with a friend. \"The boy seems straightforward,\" he said. \"What do you think?\" \"I agree with you. Still, the man was seen to run in this direction.\" The first questioner was the one most concerned in the capture of the guilty party, for it was his store that had been robbed.[Pg 216] \"Have you been here all the time?\" he asked, turning once more to Bob. \"No, sir; my friend and I have been to the village to get supper.\" \"Did you leave no one on board?\" \"Yes, sir; a colored boy in my service—a boy named Clip.\" \"Did he mention having seen any suspicious party, or any man who seemed to be running away?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Where is he? I would like to speak with him.\" \"He has gone to the village to get his supper.\" If Clip had been present he would no doubt have been questioned, but as he was absent the party of investigation did not think it worth while to wait. \"That\u0027s rather curious, Sam,\" said Bob, when they were again alone. \"We were suspected of screening a criminal.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t give much for the fellow\u0027s chance of escape. They are evidently determined to catch him.\"[Pg 217] These words were all distinctly heard by the man in hiding. \"I was lucky to fall in with the little nigger,\" he reflected. \"Them boys would have refused to help me. They would give me up now if they knew I was on board. I must be careful.\" Clip came back at the end of half an hour. If Bob had taken notice of him, he would have noticed that the boy\u0027s pockets bulged out as if crowded with articles. But he had no especial reason for suspecting Clip of any underhand proceeding, and sat with Sam talking about home matters, leaving his young colored servant to his own devices. Clip was faithful to his trust. He had agreed to take care of his concealed passenger, and he was determined to do so. As soon as he could do so without observation, he went to the man\u0027s hiding-place and poured out the contents of his pockets. There were some buns and small rolls and a few round cakes. \"Will they do you, mister?\" he asked, in a low voice.[Pg 218] \"Yes; but I\u0027m terribly thirsty. Have you got any whisky aboard?\" Clip shook his head. \"We ain\u0027t got no \u0027toxicating liquors,\" he answered. \"Can you bring me a glass of water?\" \"I\u0027ll try. If you\u0027d let me tell Massa Bob you were on board, I guess he\u0027d give you some milk.\" \"Milk be—hanged! No, I\u0027ll make it do with water. Don\u0027t you tell this Bob, on any account, that I am here!\" \"All right, massa!\" answered Clip; but he was getting more and more puzzled. \"Are you goin\u0027 to stay in dat place all night?\" \"Yes.\" \"You\u0027ll find it mighty uncomfor\u0027ble. If Massa Bob knew you was here—\" \"He is not to know, do you hear?\" said the other, impatiently. \"All right, massa! You know best.\" \"Of course I know best.\" By this time Clip was missed. \"Where are you, Clip?\" asked Bob.[Pg 219] \"I\u0027m jist loafin\u0027 around, Massa Bob,\" said Clip, a little startled. \"There\u0027s something strange about you to-night, Clip; I don\u0027t understand it.\" \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 of old times down in Arkansaw, Massa Bob.\" \"Would you like to be there now, Clip?\" \"No, Massa Bob, I\u0027d rather live with you and your mudder. My ol\u0027 massa use to give me plenty of lickin\u0027s. I don\u0027t want to go back, never no more.\" Clip still continued to be restless and uneasy. He knew he had no authority for taking a passenger on board, and feared that Bob would take away the five dollars if he learned that Clip had accepted so large a sum. To do Clip justice, he had no idea that the man whom he had hidden was an offender against the laws, and that the police were in search of him. Even if he had known this, however, it is not certain that Clip would have been prejudiced against the offender. In truth, his prejudices were against the agents of the law rather than against those who had offended. Bob and Sam usually retired early; but [Pg 220]to-night, to Clip\u0027s discontent, they remained up later than usual, talking about matters at home. \"Isn\u0027t you ever goin\u0027 to bed, Massa Bob?\" asked Clip, at last. \"What is your hurry, Clip? Are you sleepy?\" \"Awful sleepy, Massa Bob,\" answered Clip; \"can\u0027t hardly keep my eyes open.\" \"Then you can go to bed any time. Sam and I will soon follow.\" This was not altogether satisfactory, for Clip meant to get up as soon as Bob and Sam were asleep and visit his passenger, who had expressed a wish to have him do so. However, there was nothing to be said, and Clip withdrew to his bunk and lay down; but, as may readily be guessed, his mind was too active for sleep. There was some one else who was anxious to have Bob and Sam retire. This was the hidden passenger, who found his quarters contracted and uncomfortable. \"What\u0027s the matter with those confounded boys?\" he growled to himself. \"They seem[Pg 221] determined to sit up on purpose to vex me. When they are once asleep I can get up and stretch my limbs.\" In about twenty minutes the boys, judging from their deep and regular breathing, had fallen asleep. Clip, who had been waiting anxiously, raised himself on his elbow and eyed them closely. Feeling that it was now safe for him to do so, he slipped out of bed cautiously and began to feel his way toward the hiding-place of his new acquaintance. \"They\u0027re asleep,\" he whispered. \"Now, what you want, massa?\" \"It\u0027s high time they were,\" growled the man. \"I thought they were going to sit up all night.\" \"So did I,\" returned Clip. \"Are you sure there is no whisky on board?\" \"No, massa.\" \"I suppose you could get some for me on shore. There\u0027s a saloon only three minutes\u0027 walk from this place.\"[Pg 222] Clip was reluctant to go on shore on such an errand; but finally the offer of fifty cents for himself induced him to do so. He took a tin cup which Bob had brought with him from home, and started on his errand. At the saloon he was asked, \"Do you want this for yourself? We don\u0027t sell to boys.\" \"No, massa; it\u0027s for a sick man.\" \"Where\u0027s the sick man?\" \"On board a boat.\" Upon this representation the whisky was obtained, and Clip started on his return. His curiosity led him to take a swallow of the whisky he was carrying, but it did not commend itself to Clip\u0027s palate. \"It\u0027s nasty stuff!\" he said with a grimace; \"I don\u0027t see what fo\u0027 people drink it.\" He carried the drink safely to the passenger, who drank it and smacked his lips over it. \"It goes to the right spot,\" he said. \"Do those boys sleep sound?\" he asked. \"Yes, massa.\"[Pg 223] \"Then I\u0027ll get out of this beastly hole and take a turn on deck.\" \"Be keerful, massa!\" said Clip anxiously. \"Oh, yes; I won\u0027t make any noise.\" Clip crept back to bed and succeeded in resuming his place without disturbing or arousing Bob or Sam.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2957/81334.html","bookId":432,"book":{"id":432,"title":"Bob Burton or The Young Ranchman of the Missouri","description":"简介： Clip, as may be inferred, was a negro boy, now turned of fourteen, who for four years had been attached to the service of Richard Burton, a ranchman, whose farm lay on a small stream tributary to the Missouri, in the fertile State of Iowa.
