{"id":11970,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVII. BROWN AND MINTON WALK INTO A TRAP.","content":"Little suspecting the reception awaiting them in St. Louis, Minton and Brown were laboriously guiding their stolen craft down the river. Not being accustomed to labor of any sort, they found the confinement irksome, but the prize for which they were striving was so large that they took it very good-humoredly. They whiled away the time by indulging in visions of future ease and prosperity, and in exchanging witticisms at the expense of Bob, the youthful owner of the boat. \"I wonder how the young captain is enjoying himself,\" said Minton, as he lay back, with one of the bins for a support, while puffing at a choice cigar. \"He is ready to tear his hair out, I presume,\" said Brown. \"He\u0027s a conceited[Pg 313] young popinjay, and deserves to have his pride taken down.\" \"You\u0027re right there, Brown. We shall make a tidy sum out of our venture.\" \"Yes; we can afford to retire for a time. Of course I shall want more than half.\" \"I don\u0027t see that,\" said Minton, quickly. \"Why, man, I\u0027ve done all the headwork. What have you done to compare with me?\" \"We are equal partners,\" said Minton, doggedly. \"That is where you are mistaken. I don\u0027t mind, though, giving you half of what we get for the girl.\" \"How shall we arrange to get anything? It is rather a ticklish business—\" \"That\u0027s where the headwork comes in. I shall wait upon old Pearson, and tell him that I have a clew, and suspect I know who abducted the child. Then I\u0027ll work him up to a point where he\u0027ll shell out liberally.\" \"Won\u0027t there be risk?\" \"How can there be? Leave the thing to me and I\u0027ll arrange it. The fact is, Minton, you are a man of no ideas. If I depended on[Pg 314] you, you wouldn\u0027t make a cent out of one of the neatest jobs I\u0027ve ever been concerned in.\" Minton was conscious that there was some truth in this, and it helped to reconcile him to the evident determination of his companion to appropriate the lion\u0027s share of the fruits of their questionable enterprises. \"I suppose Joe\u0027s all right?\" he said, after a pause. \"Of course he is. What would he make by proving false to us?\" \"Nothing, that I can see. Still, if he should do so, it might upset our plans. The boy could afford to pay him well for releasing him.\" \"That is true,\" returned Brown, thoughtfully. \"On all accounts it will be necessary for us to expedite matters. I sha\u0027n\u0027t waste any time once we are in St. Louis.\" \"You mean in disposing of the cargo?\" \"Precisely. I am in no position to haggle about prices. I\u0027ll offer it at a bargain to some large dealer. He will naturally think I\u0027m a country gentleman, and clinch the bargain at once. Do you see?\"[Pg 315] \"Yes, Brown. You\u0027ve got the right idea.\" \"Of course I have,\" said Brown, complacently. \"It takes a long head to outwit me. Got another cigar, Minton?\" Minton drew out one and handed to his confederate, and presently took his turn at the rudder. So time passed, the boat making good progress, and about three o\u0027clock in the afternoon the boat reached an obscure pier in the lower part of St. Louis. There were some interested persons watching its arrival. Among them were Bob and his friend Clip, and a small squad of policemen. Not suspecting anything, Brown and Minton busied themselves in bringing the boat to anchor. Meanwhile Bob, without being observed, stepped aboard. \"Good afternoon, Mr. Brown! I hope you had a pleasant trip,\" he said, quietly. Brown felt as if he had been struck by lightning. Wheeling around suddenly, he saw Bob\u0027s eyes fixed upon him. He was absolutely speechless with amazement and consternation. \"Who are you?\" he finally ejaculated,[Pg 316] quickly resolving to brazen it out, and deny Bob\u0027s claim to ownership. \"I think you know me, Mr. Brown!\" replied Bob. \"I have only to thank you for taking charge of my boat and bringing it safe to St. Louis.\" \"Look here, young feller!\" said Brown, roughly, \"you must be crazy. I never saw you before in my life, and here you come on board my boat and claim it as your own. If you don\u0027t clear out I\u0027ll have you arrested.\" \"There will be no difficulty about that, Mr. Brown. Here are policemen close at hand.\" Mr. Brown\u0027s face grew pale as he saw three stalwart policemen marching on board the boat. \"I guess it\u0027s all up, Minton!\" he said, and made a dash for liberty; but he was not quick enough. He and Minton were quickly secured and marched off, with handcuffs on their wrists. As we are now to bid these gentlemen farewell, it may be said briefly that they pleaded guilty in hopes of a lighter sentence, and were sent to prison for seven years. Thus[Pg 317] far the community has been able to spare them without inconvenience. Bob and Clip resumed charge of the boat, and during the next day disposed of the cargo to Mr. Pearson at the price agreed upon. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2957/81346.html","bookId":432,"book":{"id":432,"title":"Bob Burton or The Young Ranchman of the Missouri","description":"简介： Clip, as may be inferred, was a negro boy, now turned of fourteen, who for four years had been attached to the service of Richard Burton, a ranchman, whose farm lay on a small stream tributary to the Missouri, in the fertile State of Iowa.
