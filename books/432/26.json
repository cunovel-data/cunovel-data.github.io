{"id":11959,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. WAS IT THE CAT?","content":"Usually Bob Burton slept all night; but to-night, unfortunately for Clip, he awakened about two o\u0027clock in the morning. By an equally perverse chance, just as he awoke, the concealed passenger, now enjoying the freedom of the deck, broke out into a stentorian sneeze. Bob heard it, and so did Clip, whose uneasiness made him sleep more lightly than usual, and both were startled. \"I hope Massa Bob won\u0027t hear dat,\" thought Clip. But Bob did hear it. \"What\u0027s that?\" he asked, half rising in bed. \"It\u0027s me!\" answered Clip, preferring to admit the sneeze rather than have Bob suspect that there was any one else on the boat. \"Do you mean to say you sneezed, Clip?\" asked Bob, in amazement.[Pg 225] \"Yes, Massa Bob.\" \"You must be dreaming. The sneeze came from another part of the boat.\" \"Are you sure?\" asked Clip. \"Yes. What made you tell me that it was you who sneezed?\" \"I t\u0027ought I did, Massa Bob.\" \"When did you wake up?\" \"Just now.\" \"The sneeze must have waked you up.\" \"I dunno,\" answered Clip, dubiously. \"There must be some one on board, unless we both dreamed about the sneeze.\" \"Mebbe it\u0027s a cat!\" remarked Clip, ingenuously. Bob laughed. \"It must be a very remarkable cat that would sneeze like that,\" he said. \"Jus\u0027 so, Massa Bob,\" assented Clip, meekly, hoping that Bob would drop the subject. \"I think, Clip, I shall get up and search for that cat.\" \"Don\u0027t you do it, Massa Bob. He—he might bite you.\"[Pg 226] \"I hope I am not such a coward as to be afraid of a cat.\" Bob rose and lighted a candle which he had with him. Then, followed by Clip, he advanced to the other end of the deck. But the passenger had warning, having heard the conversation which had taken place between Bob and Clip, and had hurriedly retreated to his former hiding-place. It did not occur to Bob to look there, and he returned from his fruitless search more mystified than ever. But, Clip being close beside him, he caught the aroma of the single swallow of whisky which Clip had taken, and he immediately began to suspect poor Clip of having indulged in much deeper potations than he was guilty of. \"Clip,\" he said, suddenly, \"I smell whisky.\" \"Does you, Massa Bob?\" asked Clip, feeling that he was getting into a scrape. \"Yes, I do, Clip; and where do you think it comes from?\" \"Don\u0027t know, Massa Bob; \u0027deed I don\u0027t.\" \"It comes from your mouth, Clip. You\u0027ve been drinking!\"[Pg 227] Drops of perspiration stood on Clip\u0027s forehead. He could not excuse himself, or explain matters, without betraying his secret. Not thinking of anything to say, he said nothing. \"Tell me the truth, Clip; have you been drinking?\" \"I jes\u0027 took a little swaller.\" \"Where did you take it?\" \"On sho\u0027.\" \"What made you do such a thing? I didn\u0027t dream that you were getting intemperate, Clip.\" \"You see, Massa Bob, a gen\u0027leman asked me to bring him a drink of whisky, and I t\u0027ought I\u0027d jest see how it tasted.\" \"Who asked you to bring him some whisky?\" asked Bob, who believed this to be a pure fiction on the part of his young companion. \"A gen\u0027leman.\" \"What gentleman?\" \"He didn\u0027t tell me his name.\" \"I think you are telling me a lie, Clip.\" \"No I ain\u0027t, Massa Bob; it\u0027s as true as de Bible.\"[Pg 228] \"I don\u0027t think you know much about the Bible, Clip.\" \"It\u0027s all true what I told you, Massa Bob. If I find de gen\u0027leman, I\u0027ll bring him here to tell you.\" The witness referred to smiled to himself grimly when he heard this statement. \"That little nigger\u0027s a brick!\" he said to himself. \"As to that other boy, I\u0027d like to throw him overboard. He\u0027s too fond of meddling with other people\u0027s business.\" It may occur to the reader that this was hardly a fair way of stating the case. As the boat belonged to Bob, and he was the commander, it might safely be assumed that he had a right to inquire into anything that excited his suspicion. \"Are you goin\u0027 back to bed, Massa Bob?\" asked Clip, uneasily. \"Wait a minute, Clip; I want to get a drink of water.\" Again poor Clip was in bad luck. The tin dipper had been used to procure the whisky, and of course it still smelled strongly of that liquor.[Pg 229] \"Clip,\" said Bob, as soon as he had raised it to his lips, \"you got some whisky in this cup.\" \"Ye\u0027es,\" admitted Clip. \"And you drank it yourself instead of giving it to any gentleman.\" \"No, I didn\u0027t, Massa Bob,\" stoutly, and as we know truly, asserted Clip. \"I\u0027m ashamed of you, Clip. If you are going to act in this way, I shall have to send you home. You have been acting very queerly this evening. Sam and I both noticed it, but I didn\u0027t think you had formed a taste for whisky.\" \"I don\u0027t love it, Massa Bob. I hate it. It\u0027s awful nasty stuff.\" \"And you didn\u0027t drink this dipper full, then?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t.\" \"What did you do with it?\" \"Throwed it away, Massa Bob. I only took one swaller. I couldn\u0027t drink it if you gave me half a dollar; \u0027deed I couldn\u0027t.\" \"I hope this is true, Clip. I shouldn\u0027t like to tell my mother that you had become intemperate.\"[Pg 230] \"What\u0027s the matter?\" was heard from Sam\u0027s bed at this juncture. \"Where are you, Bob?\" \"Here I am, Sam.\" \"What made you get up?\" \"I thought I heard a noise on deck; so Clip and I got up.\" \"What was it like?\" \"A sneeze. Clip thought it might be a cat.\" Bob and Sam laughed at the ludicrous idea, and Clip joined in, glad that Bob\u0027s embarrassing cross-examination was over. \"You\u0027d better come to bed, both of you. Very likely you dreamed it.\" At that moment, and before Bob had put out the candle, there was a most unlooked-for corroboration of Clip\u0027s singular theory. An immense tom-cat ran swiftly between Bob\u0027s legs, from some place of concealment. Both he and Clip saw it, and the latter was quick to take advantage of the opportune appearance of the animal. \"Dare\u0027s de cat, Massa Bob,\" he shouted, triumphantly. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you it was a cat?\"[Pg 231] Bob was temporarily nonplussed. Clip seemed to have the best of the argument. \"All I can say is, it is a remarkable cat,\" he said. \"I wish it would sneeze again.\" The rest of the night passed without anything remarkable happening. All three boys slept soundly. Indeed, it was later than usual, probably on account of their sleep being interrupted during the night, that they awoke. According to custom, the boys took turns in going out to breakfast. \"Clip, you and Sam can go out together,\" said Bob. \"I will take my turn afterwards.\" \"I ain\u0027t in no hurry, Massa Bob,\" said Clip. \"You an\u0027 Sam go first, and I\u0027ll go afterwards.\" Bob thought this a little strange, but did not object. When Clip was left alone he went at once to see his charge. \"Hope you pass de night good,\" said Clip, politely. \"I\u0027m awfully cramped up,\" groaned the other. \"But you\u0027re a trump, Clip. You stood by me like a Trojan.\" \"Thank you, massa. I\u0027m afraid Massa[Pg 232] Bob\u0027ll find you out. How long you goin\u0027 to stay?\" \"Till I get a few miles from this town. Then he may find me and welcome.\" Clip felt that it would be a great relief to him when there was no further need of concealment. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2957/81335.html","bookId":432,"book":{"id":432,"title":"Bob Burton or The Young Ranchman of the Missouri","description":"简介： Clip, as may be inferred, was a negro boy, now turned of fourteen, who for four years had been attached to the service of Richard Burton, a ranchman, whose farm lay on a small stream tributary to the Missouri, in the fertile State of Iowa.
