{"id":11942,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX. SAM\u0027S GIFT.","content":"\"What!\" exclaimed Bob, in great excitement. \"Not the receipt for the money?\" \"That\u0027s just what it is,\" answered Sam, nodding emphatically. \"Let me see it.\" Sam put the paper in Bob\u0027s hand. There it was in regular form, a receipt for one hundred and fifty dollars, being the semi-annual interest on a mortgage on Burton\u0027s Ranch, dated on the day of Richard Burton\u0027s death, and signed by Aaron Wolverton. \"Hurrah!\" shouted Bob, waving it aloft. \"Then father did pay it, after all, and that mean scoundrel—excuse my speaking of your uncle in such terms, Sam—\" \"I don\u0027t mind,\" said Sam, philosophically. \"That mean scoundrel wanted us to pay[Pg 78] the money a second time. I\u0027m ever so much obliged to you, Sam. But where on earth did you find it?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you, Bob,\" answered Sam, perching himself on the fence. \"This forenoon Uncle Aaron started out on business—I don\u0027t know where he went.\" \"I know,\" said Clip, giving way to a burst of merriment. \"How do you know?\" \"I rowed him across de creek. I was out in de boat when old Massa Wolverton come along and axed me to take him across. I made him pay me a nickel, and he got into de boat,\" and Clip began to laugh once more. \"I don\u0027t see anything to laugh at, Clip.\" \"You would, massa Bob, ef you\u0027d been dar. We was almost across when de old boat upset, yah! yah! and old Massa Wolverton—it makes me laugh like to split—tumbled into de water, and got wet as a drownded rat.\" \"Clip, you bad boy, you did it on purpose,\" said Bob, trying to look stern. \"Wish I may die!\" asseverated Clip, [Pg 79]stoutly, for he was not an imitator of George Washington. \"Didn\u0027t de old man look mad, dough? He jest shook his fist at me, and called me a black imp, \u0027deed he did.\" \"I am afraid he was right, Clip,\" said Bob, shaking his head. \"But you haven\u0027t told me about the receipt, Sam.\" \"He sent me into his room to get his hat, when right down on the floor by his desk, I saw a piece of paper. I remembered what you told me, Bob, about the receipt, so I picked it up and slipped it into my pocket. I had to be quick about it, for Uncle Aaron is always in a hurry. Well, I took out the hat, and I didn\u0027t dare to take out the paper and look at it till he was out of sight.\" \"And then—\" \"Well, then I saw it was the paper you wanted.\" \"Mr. Wolverton took it from the pocket of my poor father when he lay dead on the spot where he was thrown out,\" said Bob, gravely. \"It would be hard to think of a meaner piece of rascality.\" \"Well, I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve got it, Bob. I don\u0027t[Pg 80] know as I was right in taking it, but I\u0027ll take the risk.\" \"If you never do anything worse than that, Sam, you won\u0027t have much to answer for. I wish you\u0027d let me give you something.\" \"No, Bob, you are my friend, and it would be a pity if I couldn\u0027t do you a favor without getting paid for it.\" \"But this is a great favor. It is worth a hundred and fifty dollars. Without it we might, and probable would, have to pay the interest money over again. Now, when your uncle calls for it, we shall only have to show him the receipt.\" \"He\u0027ll wonder where it came from.\" \"I hope it won\u0027t get you into trouble, Sam.\" \"He won\u0027t suspect me. He\u0027ll know I couldn\u0027t break into his desk, and he won\u0027t know anything about having dropped it on the floor. I don\u0027t see how he came to be so careless.\" \"Depend upon it, Sam, it was the work of Providence. Mother says that God often overrules the designs of the wicked, and I think this is an instance. Henceforth, Sam,[Pg 81] though you are old Wolverton\u0027s nephew, I shall consider you a friend of our family. Why can\u0027t you stay to supper to-night?\" \"It would never do, Bob, unless I asked permission.\" \"Then ask permission.\" \"I am afraid it wouldn\u0027t be granted.\" \"If your uncle is as mean as I think he is, he would be glad for you to get a meal at the expense of somebody else.\" \"He wouldn\u0027t like to have me enjoy myself,\" said Sam. \"Is he so mean as that?\" \"Whenever he hears me singing, he looks mad, and wants to know why I am making a fool of myself.\" \"He\u0027s an uncle to be proud of,\" said Bob, ironically. \"I just wish I could live at your house, Bob.\" \"Perhaps I can make an exchange, and give Clip to your uncle instead of you.\" \"Oh, Massa Bob, don\u0027t you do it!\" exclaimed Clip, looking scared. \"Old Massa[Pg 82] Wolverton would kill me, I know he would. He hates niggers, I heard him say so.\" Bob and Sam laughed, being amused by the evident terror of the young colored boy. \"I won\u0027t do it, Clip, unless you are very bad,\" said Bob, gravely, \"though I think Sam would be willing to change.\" \"Indeed I would,\" said Sam with a sigh. \"There\u0027s no such good luck for me.\" When Bob carried in the receipt and showed it to his mother, her face lighted up with joy. \"This is indeed a stroke of good fortune,\" she said; \"or rather it seems like a direct interposition of Providence—that Providence that cares for the widow and the fatherless. You must make Sam a present.\" \"So I will, mother; but if he understands it is for this he won\u0027t take anything.\" \"Sam is evidently very different from his uncle. He is a sound scion springing from a corrupt trunk. Leave it to me to manage. Won\u0027t he stay to supper?\" \"Not to-night. I invited him, but he was afraid to accept the invitation, for fear of being punished.\"[Pg 83] \"Is his uncle so severe, then?\" \"I suspect he beats Sam, though Sam doesn\u0027t like to own it.\" \"And this man, this cruel tyrant, wants to marry me,\" thought Mrs. Burton, shuddering. Two days later Sam chanced to be in the house with the two boys, when Mrs. Burton passed through the room, and greeted him pleasantly. \"When is your birthday?\" she asked. \"Last week—Thursday—ma\u0027am.\" \"How old are you?\" \"Fifteen.\" \"Did you receive a birthday present?\" Sam shook his head. \"There\u0027s no one to give me presents,\" he said. \"You have an uncle and aunt, Sam.\" \"They never give presents. They tell me I ought to be thankful that they take care of me, and save me from going to the poor-house.\" \"There would be no danger of that, Sam,\" said Bob. \"If your uncle ever turns you out to shift for yourself, come and live with us.\" \"I wish he would turn me out to-morrow,[Pg 84] then,\" said Sam; and it was evident the boy meant it. \"Sam, you will permit me to make up for your uncle\u0027s neglect,\" said Mrs. Burton, kindly. \"Here is a neck-tie. I bought it for Robert, but I can get another for him. And here is something else which may prove acceptable.\" She drew from her pocket a silver dollar, and put it into Sam\u0027s hand. \"Is this really for me?\" asked Sam, joyfully. \"Yes; it is only a small gift, but—\" \"I never had so much money before in my life,\" said Sam. \"It makes me feel rich.\" Mrs. Burton looked significantly at Bob. Her woman\u0027s wit had devised a way of rewarding Sam for the service he had done the family without his being aware of it. The gift was well meant, but it was destined to get poor Sam into trouble. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2957/81318.html","bookId":432,"book":{"id":432,"title":"Bob Burton or The Young Ranchman of the Missouri","description":"简介： Clip, as may be inferred, was a negro boy, now turned of fourteen, who for four years had been attached to the service of Richard Burton, a ranchman, whose farm lay on a small stream tributary to the Missouri, in the fertile State of Iowa.
