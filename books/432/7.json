{"id":11940,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII. WOLVERTON\u0027S ADVENTURE WITH CLIP.","content":"Bob and his mother deliberated as to whether they should charge Mr. Wolverton openly with the theft of the receipt. On the whole, they decided to wait a while, and be guided by circumstances. If he took any measures to collect the money a second time, there would be sufficient reason to take the aggressive. Bob had another reason for delay. He intended to acquaint Sam Wolverton with the matter, and request him to keep on the lookout for the receipt. Should he find it, he knew that Sam would gladly restore it to the rightful owner. He cautioned Clip not to say anything about what he saw on the day of his father\u0027s death, as it would put Wolverton on his guard, and lead him to destroy the receipt if still in his possession.[Pg 61] I must now relate a little incident in which Clip and Aaron Wolverton were the actors. The creek on which Burton\u0027s Ranch was located was a quarter of a mile distant from the house. It was about a quarter of a mile wide. Over on the other side of the creek was the town of Martin, which was quite as large as Carver. In some respects it was a more enterprising place than Carver, and the stores were better stocked. For this reason there was considerable travel across the creek; but as there was no bridge, the passage must be made by boat. Bob owned a good boat, which he and Clip used considerably. Both were good rowers, and during Mr. Burton\u0027s life they spent considerable time in rowing for pleasure. Now Bob\u0027s time was so occupied that the boat was employed only when there was an errand in the opposite village. \"Clip,\" said Bob, one morning, \"I want you to go down to Martin.\" \"Yes, Massa Bob,\" said Clip, with alacrity, for he much preferred such a jaunt to working in the fields.[Pg 62] The errand was to obtain a hammer and a supply of nails at the variety store in Martin. Clip was rather given to blunder, but still there was no reason why he should not execute the errand satisfactorily. Clip went down to the creek, and unfastened the boat. He jumped in, and began to paddle away, when he heard a voice calling him. \"Here, you Clip!\" Looking round, Clip recognized in the man hailing him Aaron Wolverton. Mr. Wolverton did not own any boat himself, and when he had occasion to go across the river he generally managed to secure a free passage with some one who was going over. If absolutely necessary, he would pay a nickel; but he begrudged even this small sum, so mean was he. Clip stopped paddling, and answered the call. \"Hi, Massa Wolverton; what\u0027s the matter?\" \"Come back here.\" \"What fo\u0027?\" \"I want you to take me over to Martin.\"[Pg 63] Now Clip was naturally obliging, but he disliked Wolverton as much as one of his easy good nature could do. So he felt disposed to tantalize him. \"Can\u0027t do it, Massa Wolverton. I\u0027m in a terrible hurry.\" \"It won\u0027t take you a minute to come back.\" \"Massa Bob will scold.\" \"You needn\u0027t mind that, boy. Come back, I say!\" \"I dassn\u0027t.\" \"Don\u0027t be a fool, you little nigger. I\u0027ll pay you.\" \"What\u0027ll you give?\" asked Clip, cautiously. \"I\u0027ll give you—a cent.\" \"Couldn\u0027t do it, nohow. What good\u0027s a cent to me?\" \"A cent\u0027s a good deal of money. You can buy a stick of candy.\" \"\u0027Tain\u0027t enough, Massa Wolverton. I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to resk gettin\u0027 licked for a cent.\" Cunning Clip knew that there was no danger of this, but he thought it would serve as an argument.[Pg 64] \"I\u0027ll give you two cents,\" said Wolverton, impatiently. \"Couldn\u0027t do it,\" said Clip. \"Ef it was five, now, I might \u0027sider it.\" Finally Wolverton was obliged to accede to Clip\u0027s terms, and the colored boy pushed the boat to shore, and took in his passenger. \"Can you row good, Clip?\" asked Wolverton, nervously, for he was very much afraid of the water, and he had never had Clip for a boatman before. \"You jes\u0027 bet I can, Massa Wolverton. I can row mos\u0027 as good as Massa Bob.\" \"Well, show it then; I am in a hurry to get over the creek.\" Clip rowed to the middle of the creek, and then stopped paddling. \"I reckon you\u0027d better pay me the money now, Massa Wolverton,\" he said. \"Why, you young rascal, are you afraid to trust me?\" \"I dunno \u0027bout dat; but I wants my money.\" \"You haven\u0027t earned it yet. What are you afraid of?\"[Pg 65] \"You might forget to pay me, Massa Wolverton.\" \"No, I sha\u0027n\u0027t. Push on.\" \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to sleep,\" said Clip, lying back in a lazy attitude. \"You young rascal! I\u0027ve a good mind to fetch you a slap on the side of the head.\" \"Better not, Massa Wolverton,\" drawled Clip. \"Might upset the boat.\" \"Give me the oars,\" said Wolverton, impatiently. He took them; but he had never rowed in his life, and he almost immediately turned the boat around. \"Hi, yah!\" laughed Clip, delighted. \"Where was you raised, Massa Wolverton, not to understand rowin\u0027 no better dan dat?\" \"Take the oars, you black scoundrel, and row me across, or I\u0027ll pitch you out of the boat!\" \"Ef you do, what\u0027ll \u0027come of you, Massa Wolverton?\" said Clip, not at all alarmed. This was indeed an important consideration for a man so timid on the water as the real estate agent.[Pg 66] \"You put me out of all patience,\" said Wolverton, furiously. \"Are you going to row or are you not?\" \"I want my money,\" said Clip. Wolverton was compelled to hand over a nickel, but registered a vow that if ever he caught Clip on land, he would make him pay for his impudence. Clip took the oars, and made very good progress till he was about fifty feet from the other side of the creek. Then he began to make the boat rock, stopping his rowing. \"What are you about?\" shouted Wolverton, turning pale. \"It\u0027s good fun, ain\u0027t it, Massa Wolverton?\" said Clip; laughing insolently. \"Stop, you little rascal! You\u0027ll upset the boat.\" \"Golly! ain\u0027t dis fun?\" said Clip, continuing his rocking. \"I\u0027ll choke you, if you don\u0027t stop,\" screamed Wolverton. He rose to catch hold of Clip. The boy jumped up, and ducked his head. The result of the combined motion was that the boat,[Pg 67] which was flat-bottomed, capsized, and the two were thrown into the water. There was no danger, for the water at this point was only four feet deep; and Clip could swim, while Aaron Wolverton was too tall to be drowned in that depth of water. Wolverton was almost scared out of his wits. He cut such a ludicrous figure as he floundered in the water, that Clip screamed with delight. The black boy swam to the boat, and, managing to right her, got in again; but Wolverton waded to the shore, almost beside himself with rage. \"Is you wet, Massa Wolverton?\" asked Clip, innocently, showing his white teeth. \"Come ashore, and I\u0027ll lick you!\" shouted Wolverton, who had by this time landed, his clothes dripping wet. \"I reckon I\u0027m too busy,\" answered Clip, with a grin. \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027s wet, Massa Wolverton. Hi yah!\" \"I\u0027ll wring your neck, you young tike!\" said Wolverton, savagely. \"Dat old man\u0027s a hog,\" mused Clip. \"Ain\u0027t much like my poor old gran\u0027ther. He was[Pg 68] always kin\u0027 an\u0027 good. I mind him sittin\u0027 in front of de ole cabin door down in Arkansaw. I \u0027spec\u0027 de old chap\u0027s done dead afore this,\" concluded Clip, with a sigh. Clip kept at a safe distance from shore, and the agent was compelled to defer his vengeance, and go to the house of an acquaintance to borrow some dry clothes. When he returned, it is needless to say that it was not in Clip\u0027s boat. He opened his desk, to enter a business transaction in his account-book, when he made a startling discovery. The receipt had disappeared! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2957/81316.html","bookId":432,"book":{"id":432,"title":"Bob Burton or The Young Ranchman of the Missouri","description":"简介： Clip, as may be inferred, was a negro boy, now turned of fourteen, who for four years had been attached to the service of Richard Burton, a ranchman, whose farm lay on a small stream tributary to the Missouri, in the fertile State of Iowa.
