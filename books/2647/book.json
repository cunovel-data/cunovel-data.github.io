But all their trials on the battlefield can\u0027t prepare them for their greatest challenge yet: winning the hearts of four willful Scottish beauties. A Warrior\u0027s Heart Connor, chieftain of the MacDonalds of Sleat, holds the fate of his people in his hands. Rival clans are plotting to take over his lands, and duty determines whom he will fight, trust . . . even marry. Seeking guidance, Connor turns to Ilysa, a young lass with the gift of foresight, who reveals an approaching danger-and a passion that burns only for him. But the warrior must make a powerful marriage alliance, and Ilysa\u0027s bloodline is far too humble. With her powers to heal and see evil where others cannot, beautiful Ilysa dresses plainly, speaks softly, and loves her chieftain from afar. Yet when Connor finally stokes the embers of desire that have so long burned within her, Ilysa feels bliss unlike any she\u0027s ever known. Now as he is forced to place duty before happiness, Ilysa senses Connor is in grave peril. Can she find a way to prove she is the woman he needs by his side?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-chieftain-return-of-the-highlanders-4.jpg","author":"Margaret Mallory","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":49,"category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
