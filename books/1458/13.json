{"id":17696,"no":13,"title":"Chapter XII. THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND AFTER: ASIA AND AUSTRALIA","content":"The beginning of the nineteenth century was signalized by the initiation of the great trigonometrical survey of India, and the first half-century was a period of much important geographical and anthropological work within that empire, but to no great extent beyond its boundaries, though in 1808 a mission penetrated to the sources of the Ganges, and Baluchistan and Afghanistan were in some part explored by officials of the East India Company. But the physical problems of the heart of the continent were left to a later period—those, for instance, concerned with the trans-Himalayan region (as viewed from India), including Tibet, eastward that region so important in the hydrography of the continent, where the river systems of China and Burma take their rise, northward the deserts of Mongolia and Turkestan, westward the nodal mountain-region of the Pamirs, and the area which long concealed the sources of the Brahmaputra (Tsanpo) and the rivers of Punjab. In spite of the endeavours of the Tibetans to hold inviolate the secrets of their land—in great measure successful so far as their capital, Lhasa, was concerned—the Indian native surveyors, such as Nain Singh, Krishna, and Ugyen Gyatso, were able to penetrate the country, and even Lhasa itself; their work covered the period 1863–82.116 And the last quarter of the century provides a wonderful record of continuous exploration in Tibet, as will appear from the mere quotation of names and dates—P. Bonvalot and Prince Henry of Orléans, 1886–87; W. W. Rockhill, 1888 and 1891; Hamilton Bower, 1891–92; Dutreuil de Rhins and F. Grenard, 1893–94; St. George Littledale, 1895; Captains W. S. Wellby, 1896, and H. H. P. Deasy, 1896, whose work was afterwards extended by Captain C. G. Rawling and by Sir M. A. Stein; and Sven Hedin, 1896–98, 1899–1902, 1906–08, whose last journey revealed the existence, long suspected, of the great mountain system north of the upper Tsan-po. This list is by no means exhaustive, nor can be that of the Russians who worked from the opposite direction, from their own territory; their leader was Nicolai Prjevalsky, who in 1871–73 and in 1876 worked in the Tsaidam region and made the first contribution to the mapping of the important hydrographical area above referred to, and in 1879 studied the vast physical changes which have taken place in Central Asia within historic times, and form one of the most remarkable geographical problems in the world. He continued his work in 1883–85, and was followed by Pevtsov and Roborovsky (1889 and 1894), P. K. Kozlov, Potanin, and many others. The names of Russian scientists, such as Baron A. Kaulbars and L. Griesbach, are also associated with the problems of the Aral and Caspian depressions. The former extensions of human settlement over areas now covered by the Central Asian deserts has been brought to light in great measure through the researches of Sven Hedin, and especially of Sir M. A. Stein. The general result of all these investigations has been to modify profoundly, even during the present generation, preexisting117 ideas of the physical geography of the central region. Nor should we overlook the work of recent travellers in China proper, a broad canvas on which outlines had been sketched earlier; but details remained, and still in great part remain, to be filled in, though Ferdinand Baron von Richthofen, in the course of his seven journeys in 1868–72, left few districts entirely unvisited. \n \n The problem of the former existence of flourishing communities in areas now desert, and of the causes of the change, has a partial counterpart in southern Arabia. The modern period of Arabian exploration began earlier than that of Central Asia. The journeys of J. Halévy (1869), E. Glaser (1889), and J. T. Bent (1893) in the south were primarily arch?ological in purpose. In other parts of the peninsula the work of J. L. Burckhardt (1815), Sir R. F. Burton, Captain G. F. Sadlier, W. G. Palgrave, Charles Doughty, Wilfrid Blunt, C. Huber, Musil, Leachman, and others, has made it possible to lay down at least the position of the chief towns and settlements, and the main physical outlines, with close accuracy, save in the Dahna or great desert of the southern interior, which remains untrodden. \n \n The detailed exploration of Australia began from Sydney, the earliest settlement, and was directed along the coast rather than towards the interior, the penetration of which was difficult. George Bass, after a short expedition inland, was accompanied by Matthew Flinders in exploring the coast of New South Wales as far as the George River and Hat Hill towards the end of the eighteenth century; in 1797–98 Bass Strait was found to separate Tasmania from the mainland, and that island was circumnavigated. Bass was118 subsequently lost in South America; but Flinders extended the work in 1801–03, when, having sailed from England, he worked from King George Sound at the south-west of Australia right round the south, east, and north coasts as far as Arnhem Bay, west of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and would have accomplished more but for the unseaworthiness of his ship. Flinders was not only a competent explorer, but also a man of theories: he took the limestone cliffs of the Great Australian Bight (south coast) for coral reefs, and when he entered Spencer Gulf he thought of a northward strait connecting with the Gulf of Carpentaria, and conceived an Australian archipelago; nor was he wholly disabused until he had definitely located the heads of both gulfs. A number of important inlets, such as Port Phillip, Keppel Bay, and Port Bowen, were thoroughly investigated by him, and he also surveyed the Great Barrier Reef. And the substitution of the name of Australia for New Holland is due to a suggestion of his. His unfinished survey of the western shores was completed by Captain P. P. King in voyages between 1817 and 1822. \n \n The accident of a drought in 1813 drove some of the Sydney settlers to look for new pastures in the hinterland. The divide between the short eastward and the long westward drainage systems was surmounted with difficulty; a road to the point where the town of Bathurst afterwards grew up was promptly made, and an arresting geographical problem confronted the investigators when the westward-flowing rivers Macquarie and Lachlan were found. Lieutenant Oxley, R.N., attempting to follow the Lachlan in 1815, was presently brought to a halt by great swamps. He struck south to avoid them, and narrowly missed discovering the119 Murrumbidgee river, before he turned back to carry to Sydney the conviction that the westward drainage generally was lost in swamps fringing an inland sea. Cunningham found a route from this coast up to the rich Liverpool Plains, towards the north of New South Wales, in 1823; but for the most part exploration was temporarily directed to the south-west, and Hamilton Hume and Hovell in 1824–25 took an inland route from New South Wales to the south coast on the west side of Port Phillip. This inlet was not recognized by them; they returned to report that they had seen the coast-land, and found it good, further to the east at Western Port; settlers who visited that district on their recommendation were disappointed, and the development of the Victoria coast-lands received a set-back in consequence of this error. Cunningham in 1828 opened the route from the coast at Brisbane to the downs of the south Queensland hinterland. In the same year a new phase was entered in the solution of the problem of the far interior, when Charles Sturt, carrying with him Oxley’s conviction of the existence of an inland sea, journeyed inland at a season of drought to find the Macquarie river losing itself on the dry plains, and the Darling flowing salt. He attributed this fact to an admixture of sea-water, and set down the interior of the continent as a desert. In the following year he settled the problem of the drainage of the Murrumbidgee, Lachlan, and Murray rivers by following them to the mouth of the Murray in Lake Alexandrina (south coast); and although he now held that the waters of the Darling were included (as they are) in this system, it was still doubted whether there was a divide between north and south flowing waters about the central latitude of New South Wales, where, in the interior,120 high ground was known to exist. Sir Thomas Mitchell settled this question by a great journey in 1836, which, among other results, immediately threw open to settlement the fertile country about Port Phillip, hitherto, as we have seen, neglected through the misunderstanding of Hume and Hovell. \n \n The larger problems of Australian geography were thus early settled, though there was (as even now there is in some parts) a multitude of details to be filled in. But the leading questions awaiting solution by explorers now become economic rather than purely geographical. Thus we find Dr. Leichhardt’s first expedition (1844), from Moreton Bay in southern Queensland by the Burdekin, Mitchell, and Roper rivers to Port Essington, inspired by the conception of an overland route between Sydney and a northern seaport. He was lost (and the mystery of his fate was never solved) in 1848 in attempting a crossing of the continent from east to west, and Kennedy’s expedition in the same year, in attempting to cross northern Australia, also met with disaster, where A. C. Gregory succeeded in 1855–56. The penetration of the interior from the south and the crossing to the north had attracted travellers before this; Eyre in 1840 had discovered the series of salt lakes and swamps which he lumped together under the name of Lake Torrens, while Sturt in 1845 added little to Eyre’s discoveries, and, after failing to penetrate the Stony Desert to the north, put a temporary period to explorations in that quarter. Babbage in 1856 and Parry in the following year obtained more accurate knowledge of the Lake Torrens region, and Goyder in 1857 reported a great freshwater lake which was found later to have been conceived out of some shallow pools and visions of the mirage.121 J. M. Stuart’s six expeditions from south to north in 1858–61 added much to exact knowledge; that of Robert Burke and William Wills in 1860–61, ill-managed as it was and ending in the death of the leaders, obtained a fame in excess of its scientific value; but other expeditions sent in search of it achieved better results, and incidentally made clear the danger of assessing the worth of some of the inland districts on the report of one traveller who might have come upon them at an unfavourable season. Thus J. McKinlay in 1861 brought word of fertile lands which Sturt had condemned as desert. The many journeys through the interior of Western Australia—such as those of J. S. Roe (1836), the brothers Gregory, H. M. Lefroy (1863), Sir J. Forrest (various expeditions in and after 1869), Warburton (1873), and Ernest Giles (first crossing from Adelaide to Perth by an inland route, 1875)—though often of extreme importance from an economic point of view, whether concerned with the discovery of pastoral lands or of gold or other mineral fields, can only be referred to here as having gradually opened up the detailed knowledge of this part of the continent, and as having redeemed it in part from a reputation for complete inhospitality, until we have now a trans-continental railway planned to connect the systems of south and of western Australia. The exploration of the Kimberley and north-western areas of the state was delayed until the latter half of the last century. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2700/74224.html","bookId":1458,"book":{"id":1458,"title":"History of Geography","description":"简介： This is not a history of geographical exploration, though the leading episodes in the advance of our knowledge of the face of the Earth are necessarily referred to in tracing the evolution of geography as a department of science.
