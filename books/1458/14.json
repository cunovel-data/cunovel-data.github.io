THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND AFTER: THE POLES","content":"(a) Arctic \\n\\n \\n\\n Following the new enthusiasm for Arctic exploration undertaken for purely scientific purposes, the British Government despatched three expeditions between 1773 and 1779. The first, under Captain Phipps, was stopped by ice off the north-west of Spitsbergen; the second, that of James Cook with the vessels Discovery and Resolution, sent to search for either a north-west or a north-east passage by the Bering Sea route, met, as has been seen (Chapter VIII.), with a measure of the success characteristic of his work, but his death at Hawaii put an end to the hope that further research in the Arctic lay before him, and the voyage continued under the command of Captain Clarke was carried only a little north of the 70th parallel in the ice-bound Bering Strait, where Clarke also died. Till 1815 little was done to elucidate the still unsolved question of the north-west passage, owing to the disturbed state of Europe and America, but the offer of a reward (the result of the exertions of Sir John Barrow in 1818) of ￡20,000 for the discovery of the passage and ￡5,000 for reaching 89° N., led to the sailing of expeditious to the American Arctic region under Lieut. J. Franklin, Captain Ross, and Lieut. E. Parry. Ross on his first123 voyage took Baffin Bay and Lancaster Sound to be land-locked on the north, and thus missed his chance of forcing the passage. \\n\\n \\n\\n Parry in two voyages, on the results of which he gained the ￡5,000 reward, succeeded in passing through Lancaster Sound, and reaching and naming Melville Island, thus proving Baffin’s discoveries. Meanwhile Franklin attempted to reach the north shores of America by land; he explored 550 miles of the coast and discovered and named Cape Turnagain, though he and his party suffered great privations on the return journey. Then the energies of explorers were directed towards combining the results obtained by Parry and Franklin; further stretches of the north coast of America were explored, and Point Barrow was reached in Bering Strait. In 1829 an expedition was undertaken by Captain John Ross and his nephew James Clark Ross; the opening of the passage was again missed (though the most northerly part of America was passed), and it was not discovered till 1851 by Kennedy on his search for Franklin. J. C. Ross, however, fixed the position of the north magnetic pole on this voyage of five years’ duration, and other valuable observations were made. The work of tracing the northern shores of America was nearly finished by 1847, chiefly by travellers in the Hudson Bay Company’s service. During this period the north coast of Siberia had also been traced almost in its entirety by the Russians, though they had not succeeded in rounding the most northerly point. \\n\\n \\n\\n In 1845 Sir John Franklin started on the voyage from which neither he nor any of his companions returned. It is not known exactly what he achieved before he was lost, but he came nearer to accomplishing the north-west124 passage than anyone before him. The expeditions of Sir John Richardson, Dr. John Rae, and others, sent by land in search of his party, filled in the last gap in the northern coast-line of America. The different expeditions, under McClintock and others, sent by sea in the fifties for the same purpose not only decided the fate of Franklin’s party and extended knowledge over a vast area, but also at last rounded the north of America. The passage found by Kennedy in 1851 was traversed in 1853 by McClure, though part of the journey was made by travelling over the ice. An expedition under Captain Inglefield determined the northern point of Smith Sound. Elisha Kent Kane extended the knowledge of Grinnell Land and Greenland towards the north, and opened the way to others who followed the waterways he discovered. In 1871 Charles Hall sailed 250 miles up Smith Sound and reached the hitherto inaccessible polar sea; he touched a more northerly point than had previously been reached by any ship (82° 11′ N.). \\n\\n \\n\\n Stirred to action by these fine achievements of the Americans, England sent out the important expedition under Captain George Nares in 1875 which obtained very valuable scientific observations, taken on the frozen polar sea, and under Albert Markham reached the furthest point north yet attained—83° 20′ N.—after battling with immense difficulties caused by bad conditions of the ice and scurvy. Meanwhile much good work had been done in the Arctic from the old world. A purely scientific expedition had been sent to the Spitsbergen seas as early as 1827 from Norway; but from then till 1858 the work of exploration was chiefly carried on by the men engaged in the seal-hunting and fishing, in the interests of their trade. Before 1872, however, several Scandinavian125 expeditions which visited Spitsbergen and Greenland brought back valuable scientific results. The most noteworthy expedition of this period, however, was Austrian; it was captained by Lieutenant Julius Payer, who had previously been on an expedition in Greenland. He and Lieutenant Weyprecht sailed in 1871 to search for the north-east passage. They were beset by ice off Novaya Zemlya, and drifted till they came to a mountainous country which they called Franz Josef Land. They believed it to consist of two large masses of land, instead of perceiving it to be an archipelago, and much of the country they thought they saw has been since proved not to exist. Franz Josef Land was not visited again till 1880, when a large part of it was surveyed by the Englishman Leigh Smith. The north-east passage was made in 1879 by A. E. Nordenski?ld, who accomplished the journey which led so many before him to failure without loss of life or vessel, and almost in one season. He had made several previous voyages in Greenland and Spitsbergen; he had also twice successfully reached the Yenisei through the Kara Sea. Captain Joseph Wiggins, an Englishman, also made several voyages through the Siberian seas, which, together with Nordenski?ld’s accomplishment of the north-east passage (1878–9), proved the route to the mouth of the Yenisei to be practicable from a commercial standpoint. Fired by Nordenski?ld’s example, the Danes made several remarkable journeys to the interior of Greenland. \\n\\n \\n\\n A new interest was given to polar research by the establishment of the international circumpolar stations in 1883. The idea was mooted first by Weyprecht, and eventually twelve expeditions of various nationalities were sent out to erect observatories at different126 points within the polar circle, so that simultaneous and continuous observations might be taken. A great deal of valuable work was done. An American expedition, led by Lieutenant A. W. Greely (1881–4), to Grinnell Land almost perished from starvation. \\n\\n \\n\\n Greenland was crossed for the first time by Fridtjof Nansen in 1888. In 1886, and again from 1892 to 1895, Robert E. Peary, an American civil engineer, made several brilliant journeys in Greenland, and extended the knowledge of the country more than two degrees to the north. It was Nansen and Peary who were destined to draw the veil from the great polar area itself, towards which so many fruitless journeys were made. From 1817 onwards many voyages were undertaken with the object of reaching the pole—as by Parry, Scoresby, Markham, and Jackson from England, Nordenski?ld from Sweden, and Koldewey from Germany. These explorers mostly started from Spitsbergen; but Nansen worked on an original plan—that of utilizing the drift of ice, which had been proved to take place right across the polar sea, to carry his ship with it. The plan was so far successful that the Fram passed from the New Siberian islands right over to Spitsbergen in three years, without, however, reaching a higher latitude than 85° 55′ N. Nansen, with Lieutenant Johansen, made a dash northwards from this point, reaching 86° 5′ N., the “farthest north” attained up to that date; he met with Frederick Jackson’s expedition in Franz Josef Land, and returned safely to Norway. This brilliant journey led to no discovery of land in the polar basin, which proved to consist of a sea of great depth, increasing towards the pole. The Duke of Abruzzi’s expedition in 1899 reached 86° 34′ N. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile much good work was being done in other127 directions in extending Arctic research. Franz Josef Land was explored, chiefly by Austrian, British, and American expeditions. Nathorst, a Swede, circumnavigated the Spitsbergen archipelago in 1898, and discovered and mapped King Oscar Fjord in Greenland in the following year. Sverdrup, Nansen’s friend and companion, sailed up Jones Sound and charted many previously unknown parts in 1899 and the following years. The story of a continent existing to the north of Bering Strait and extending right across the pole to Greenland, which was believed by many explorers, was disproved by De Long in his ill-fated voyage in the Jeannette in 1879, during which the whole party perished, though the ship’s books were afterwards found. This voyage and the journeys of the ships sent in search of De Long proved that north of Siberia lay an ocean dotted with islands. Much work was done in exploring the New Siberian Islands by the Russian, Toll, who lost his life in an effort to reach the most northerly and unknown portion of the group. In 1903–4 Amundsen in the Gj?a undertook an expedition to the North Magnetic Pole, where he carried out a continuous series of observations for two years with important scientific results. He returned by Bering Strait, thus for the first time completing the navigation of the North-west Passage. The Danes worked hard at charting the east coast of Greenland, and the outline of the north-eastern extremity of the country was accurately delineated for the first time by the expedition of L. Mylius Erichsen (1905–07), on which he and his companions perished, though their splendid records and observations were found by a relief expedition. The crowning achievement of reaching the pole itself was accomplished in 1909 by Peary, after several128 previous journeys. He had spent four consecutive winters in the Arctic regions exploring Smith Sound and the north of Greenland, from 1899 to 1902; and in 1905 he had again attempted to reach the pole by Smith Sound and Grant Land, touching 87° 6′ N. At or near the pole there was no land to be seen, and the sea was 1,500 fathoms deep. Thus there remains no Arctic problem of the first magnitude to-day. The main outline of the Arctic region as a great and deep sea surrounded by the northern shores of Europe, Asia, America, and Greenland, is known, though there is still a large portion of the polar basin north of Alaska as yet untouched by explorers. Here, however, some high authorities believe that a considerable extent of land remains to be discovered beyond the Beaufort Sea. Even now maps show a doubtful coast-line some fifty miles due north of Point Barrow, and in 1913 an expedition left Canada under Stefansson with the solution of this problem as its main object. \\n\\n (b) Antarctic. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the Antarctic an important voyage, which supplemented Cook’s work, was undertaken in 1819 by Fabian von Bellingshausen. He succeeded in sailing half round the Antarctic circle, keeping to high southern latitudes all the way, and voyaging within the circle for considerable distances. He found the first land seen within the Antarctic circle, Peter Island, and, later, Alexander Island; he discovered the Traverse Islands, and on his return in 1821 touched at the South Shetland Islands, and met there sealers, by one of whom, William Smith, the islands had been discovered in 1819. In the next year, 1822, the South Orkney Islands were found and named by another sealer. The129 next voyager was James Weddell, who reached the highest latitude yet attained, 74° 15’ S., in 1823. At his highest latitude he had clear sea before him, but was forced to turn back by the approach of winter, and returned with many interesting observations and collections. A courageous journey was also made in 1831 by John Biscoe, a sealer, who started out to search for land from the Sandwich Islands, and succeeded in sailing for some months within the Antarctic circle in a higher latitude than Bellingshausen, and sighted land which he named Enderby Land. In spite of the sufferings he had endured and the death of the greater number of his crew, he started again in the following year from New Zealand, discovered Biscoe Islands, and took possession for England of the land which he could see lying behind them; this was subsequently named Graham Land. Biscoe was in the employ of an enterprising London firm, the Enderby Brothers, and after the remarkable results which he had achieved, they were encouraged to pursue their policy of directing their captains to embrace every opportunity of exploration. In 1833 one of them, John Kemp, found land to the east of Enderby Land, and in 1839 John Balleny discovered the islands named after him. \\n\\n \\n\\n About 1835 general interest was aroused in Antarctic problems, and three expeditions were prepared in England, France, and America to make magnetic observations, and to explore as far as possible the southern continent, now at length defined within reasonable limits. The French expedition, under Dumont d’Urville, was the first to start in 1838, but achieved little beyond the exploration of some land south of the South Shetland Islands, which was called Louis Philippe Land. After wintering in Tasmania,130 however, d’Urville decided on making a great effort to reach the south magnetic pole, and though he failed in this, he found a mountainous land which he named Adélie Land. The American expedition under Charles Wilkes did not meet with any great success, hampered as it was by quarrels among the officers and by unseaworthy ships; but land was several times sighted at a distance, and on Wilkes’s return controversy arose as to whether the honour of the discovery of this southern continent belonged to the French or the American expedition. \\n\\n \\n\\n The British expedition under Sir James Ross was the last to arrive on the scene (in 1841); but it had the advantage of the others, in that it had been specially equipped for Antarctic exploration; Ross’s ships could brave dangers from which Wilkes and d’Urville had been compelled to turn aside. He forced his way through the pack, and found a range of high mountains trending southwards, which he called Victoria Land. Following the land he came to the twin volcanoes, named Erebus and Terror after his two ships, and was stopped at length by the great ice barrier, running eastwards. During this remarkable journey Ross reached latitude 78° 4′ S., the highest yet attained. He made two further journeys, neither so successful as the first, though in 1842 he sighted the land which was rediscovered, and named King Edward Land, in the following century. After this no attempt worthy of mention was made on the south polar region for thirty years. The Challenger expedition in 1874 was not concerned with the attempt to penetrate very far south (Chapter XIV.). The voyage in Antarctic waters, however, was important from the information obtained as to the depth of the southern ocean and131 other results which helped to prove the existence of a considerable mass of land in the Antarctic region. This information was supplemented by the observations of two of the international circumpolar stations (to which reference has been made), which were established in Tierra del Fuego and South Georgia in 1882; but it was not until many years later that scientific interest was widely aroused in the problem of the Antarctic continent, and from 1874 to 1898 the only people to cross the Antarctic circle were sealers and whalers; but in 1895 C. E. Borchgrevink landed from one of these vessels for the first time on southern continental land near Cape Adare. \\n\\n \\n\\n In 1898 three expeditions started south. The first, a Belgian undertaking on board the Belgica, explored the coast to the north of Graham Land, and brought back valuable collections; the second, from Germany on the Valdivia, re-discovered Bouvet Island, whose position had long been lost; the third, from England, under Borchgrevink on the Southern Cross, landed the first party to winter in the Antarctic, reached Mount Terror, and sailed along the Great Ice Barrier, reaching latitude 78° S. In 1901 the problem was attacked for the first time by means of land-exploration; a well-equipped expedition leaving England in that year under Captain R. F. Scott voyaged along the ice-barrier, and found and named King Edward Land, first seen by Ross. Scott then proved Mount Erebus and Mount Terror to be on an island, and wintered on shore. In the following southern summer Scott, with Wilson and Shackleton, pushed southward and reached the latitude of 82° 17′, where the Great Ice Barrier reaches the foot of the lofty plateau on which the south pole is placed. Other parties traversed the ice-barrier in various directions,132 and much valuable scientific work was done in geology, biology, meteorology, magnetism, and glaciation. While Scott was in the Antarctic to the south of New Zealand, a German expedition, under E. von Drygalski, on board the Gauss, was working to the west of him, and had discovered and named Kaiser Wilhelm II. Land. Two private expeditions were also in the Antarctic at the same time, and the large number of synchronous meteorological and magnetic observations thus taken formed a valuable contribution to the knowledge of the southern continent. In 1903 a voyage was made by W. S. Bruce on the Scotia, which is important for the exploration of an entirely unknown sea lying between the tracks of Weddell and of Ross; the latitude of 74° 1′ was reached. Though the land could not be attained, its existence was proved by occasional glimpses and by the dredging up of continental rocks, and the name of Coats Land was given to it. In 1904 J. B. Charcot, a French scientist, cruised along Graham Land and found a new line of coast, which he named Loubet Land. Thus between 1902 and 1904 new land had been discovered in all the four quarters of the Antarctic circle—King Edward Land by Scott, Kaiser Wilhelm Land by Drygalski, Coats Land by Bruce, and Loubet Land by Charcot. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lieutenant (afterwards Sir) E. H. Shackleton, who had accompanied Scott, led an expedition to the south in 1908–9, which landed at the foot of Mount Erebus. That mountain was ascended by Professor T. W. E. David, who also, with Dr. D. Mawson, reached the south magnetic pole in 72° 25′ S., 155° 16′ E. Shackleton himself led the famous march which brought him to 88° 23′ S., 162° E., a great advance towards the south pole itself, which might actually have been attained but133 for the lack of food. The scientific results of the expedition were of high value, and revealed the desirability of prosecuting researches in the same field; and in 1910 Scott led a second expedition, with a larger scientific staff than had ever been taken before, the main party of which was landed at Cape Evans, McMurdo Sound. Of two other parties, one was landed on the west side of the sound; another, which worked at first from Cape Adare, was subsequently transferred to Terra Nova Bay, Victoria Land. A considerable area was thus covered on this part of the Antarctic coast, while Scott’s march upon the pole was designed to follow Shackleton’s route. The splendour of success was outshone by the splendour of disaster: Scott and four companions, having reached the pole, died bravely on the return journey, overcome by adverse conditions. The work of the expedition as a whole, taking that of the other parties into account, was a brilliant scientific triumph. \\n\\n \\n\\n The honour of first reaching the pole, however, fell to a Norwegian explorer, Captain Roald Amundsen, who, leading a small but admirably equipped expedition, succeeded in his endeavour at the end of 1911, and he and Scott thus left the way open to research on the Antarctic land-mass unhampered for the future by the natural desire to reach a certain point upon it. In the same year expeditions (not specifically concerned with the attainment of that point) were led south by the German Lieutenant Filchner, whose immediate goal was Coats Land, in the “Weddell” (or South American) quadrant, and by Dr. Mawson, whose objective was Adélie Land, on the opposite flank of the continent, while various projects are also under the consideration of other voyagers, British and American. There is room for the work of all these and more—the Antarctic region134 is now known as a vast land-area fringed by deep seas separating it from the other continental masses. Amundsen’s observations would seem to prove it a single homogeneous mass, and not to be divided into two, or to consist in part of an archipelago. It still remains to investigate the nature of any geological relation between it and the other continents, to study the extension and physiography of the great mountain ranges which are known, and their relation to the polar plateau, and to deal with the many other problems such as are suggested by observations already made on the climate, the ice conditions, and the distribution of flora and fauna—notably, in the last connection, the problem of the resemblances which have been observed between Antarctic and Arctic forms of life. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2700/74225.html","bookId":1458,"book":{"id":1458,"title":"History of Geography","description":"简介： This is not a history of geographical exploration, though the leading episodes in the advance of our knowledge of the face of the Earth are necessarily referred to in tracing the evolution of geography as a department of science.
