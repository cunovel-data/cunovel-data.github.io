{"id":83065,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"JOHNNY MAJORS STRETCHED, feeling the ripple of muscles up and down his back. He got out of bed and moved in the dark toward a chair in one corner of the bedroom where his clothes had been thrown down in hasty disarray. As he buttoned his shirt he looked across at the woman\u0027s nude form sprawled on the bed, her black body still glistening from their heated lovemaking. She said softly, \"It early yet. You don\u0027t have to go.\" \"Ten to eight,\" he said, struggling into his jeans. \"Old lady\u0027ll be wonderin\u0027 where I am. Someday she gonna go over to the Landfall and see I ain\u0027t there and then what gonna happen?\" \"You scared?\" she asked; a mocking question she knew would get to him. \"No. Hell, no. But I smart too. I ain\u0027t gonna play her to the limit.\" He zipped his fly and buckled his belt. \"Cale and Langstree won\u0027t be back \u0027til tomorrow sometime. You could spend the night.\" He grinned, his teeth gleaming in the darkness. \"The hell you say. If your man found us here in the mornin\u0027... uh uh, no. And my old lady wouldn\u0027t be so damn happy about it neither. No, baby, we got to play it smart. There enough of you for both me and Cale.\" \"Mebbe not,\" she said petulantly, drawing herself up on the pillows, her heavy breasts hanging over the sheet. He came and sat on the bed beside her. \"Hey. Your old man and Langstree\u0027ll have more trips to make. Hell, he\u0027s gone most all the time as it is now. So...\" He stroked the smooth flesh between her breasts. \"Damn me, you\u0027re a fine woman, Nora,\" he said in a husky voice. \"I need you to stay with me, Johnny. I don\u0027t like to be alone at night.\" Leaning over, licking beneath a nipple, he realized he was hard again, but he couldn\u0027t spend the time. He had been with Cale\u0027s wife for over an hour tonight, and two hours the night before; there was no use in pressing his luck. But damn, what a woman she was. She twisted those soft, beautiful hips a thousand different ways when he was inside her, wringing him out and exhausting him and driving him wild with excitement. But Christ Almighty, if that sonofabitch Cale ever found out his woman was making time there\u0027d be hell to pay... She reached out to cling to him, her hands grasping his belt buckle, but he stood up and moved away. \"No, baby, no. I got to go now.\" He slipped his shoes on. \"There\u0027ll be more times.\" She smiled at him seductively and he looked at her appreciatively - she was still warm and glowing from the merging of their heated flesh. He stood over by the room\u0027s single window, the moonlight streaming in through a broken red shutter. When he bent down to lace his shoes she saw something, a brief glimpse of a dark form moving past the window. She sat up in bed, catching her breath in a sudden gulp of air. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asked, thinking she was playing with him again. \"Hey, what\u0027s the matter with you?\" Nora sat motionless, not knowing if she had really seen something there or not. Had someone been spying on them through the shutter? Someone her husband sent to keep a watch on her? She reached down for the sodden sheet and drew it around her like a shroud. Maybe it was even Cale himself, the bastard come back early? Johnny hurriedly finished lacing his shoes, eager to be going. The house was a mile or so from the village, and he had a long ride in the dark on his bicycle. The look in the woman\u0027s eyes was giving him the creeps and, only half-joking, he demanded, \"Hey. What you lookin\u0027 at, damn jumbies?\" The shadow fell across the shutter slats. She raised a hand, palm out as if to ward it off. Her mouth opened, and her voice came out as an eerie whine. Even as Johnny Majors whirled around, sensing the presence of something beyond the window, there was a sharp crack of splintering wood as a blow struck the front door. He cried out in fear, his mind racing. It was Cale come back, either that or some of Cale\u0027s friends come to make him pay for screwing the woman. Glass and wood shattered, exploding into the bedroom. The shadow was battering its way through the window, and Johnny caught the brief flash of a wrench in the moonlight. There were more shadows out there, two, three, four, five, all merging into one pulsating darkness that ripped at the shutter and tore the glass away. Nora screamed, and backed into a far corner, Johnny looked around desperately for a weapon, hearing the front door being broken open. He picked up the chair beside the window and struck at the shadows, again and again, and for a moment they backed away. \"Jesus,\" he cried out, his chest heaving, holding the chair before him like a shield. \"Jesus God who is that out there WHO IS THAT OUT THERE?\" And in the sudden silence he heard them. Their breathing was ragged, painful, as if they were unused to the air, as if each lungful was raging fire. He could hear no voices, no movement, only the breathing of men suffering from a hideous, torturous disease, and that alone was enough to make him think he was going mad. One of the shadows moved forward, reaching slowly through the remnants of the window. The hand grasped a broken slat and began to pull it away. Johnny stood transfixed; the woman whined like a child from her corner. The hand, illuminated by the moonlight, looked gnarled and brown, the skeletal fingers like the claws of an animal. The nails were long and filthy; they scratched at the glass, a tiny noise which seemed tremendous to the trapped couple. And swirling about the room, borne in by the moist Caribbean winds, was the stench of rot; it caught them in smoky folds like some ancient fungus, or slime vomited up from the guts of the sea. In the next instant the shadow hurtled itself through the rest of the glass, its arms outstretched, black talons groping for the man. The woman screamed, a pitched, terrified noise - oh God, why wasn\u0027t this Cale not Cale NOT CALE... The man raised the chair and brought it down upon the reeking thing that had crawled over the windowsill; he struck something as solid as bone but could not stop the phantom. He realized too late that the others had broken through the door and were now behind him. Something caught him around the throat: a hand, cold and bony, and another hand gripped his hair. Nora\u0027s scream broke through the ceiling of her throat, then fell away to become a childish, insane babble. Johnny tried to fight free of the things, flailing with his arms and legs, but now they were all around him, the shadows pressing close, those terrible hands sharp icicles on his face, his throat, his arms. He threw out an elbow, striking one of them, and he heard the hissing of foul breath close to his ear; a tremendous strength picked him up and flung him into a wall, where he crashed headlong. He felt the searing pain of a broken shoulder as he slid helplessly to the floor. He twisted around, his heart hammering and the panic chewing at his insides, to face the shadows as they approached. The woman, crazed with fear, was crawling on the floor on her stomach toward a closet. He lay with his back against the wall, blood dripping from a broken nose, and saw the things as they reached out for him. The darkness covered them, but he could see their eyes. Red pinpoints of hate, they burned deep within withered skulls, unblinking and penetrating. The shadows breathed like the rising and falling of the elbows that fanned Hell\u0027s blaze. Johnny Majors held up his hands in horror and supplication, for he knew the hour of his death had arrived. \"Please,\" he pleaded. He could not hear his voice over the din of his bursting heart. \"Please don\u0027t kill meeeeeeeee...\" One of the things grinned; moonlight glittered off rotted, broken teeth, and a black tongue licked along what remained of lips. \"Please don\u0027t kill...\" Johnny Majors whispered. Two claws descended; they grasped the man\u0027s face, nails biting deep and drawing blood. And slowly, very slowly, they began to pull the man\u0027s face apart, even as he screamed in pure cold pain. Fingers ripped away the nose in tatters of dripping flesh; a hand clamped around the throat, the strong hard nails plunging deep, choking off the screams, puncturing the jugular vein and releasing a dark red river. Johnny Majors lay paralyzed against the splattered wall, his eyes glazed in shock, unseeing, his nerves feeling the agony but his brain gone and unable to respond. The hand at his throat began to peel the flesh away, exposing veins and cords. The shadows moved closer as the odor and warmth of the blood wafted up to them. Another moved in, bent forward, the eyes whirlpools of red; its claw flashed out, ripping away a cheek that dangled on slivers of skin. A three-fingered hand, bare bone showing on the knuckles, probed at an eye, in the next instant digging in and tearing it away like a quivering grape from a vine. The man opened his mouth and moaned, then shuddered involuntarily. His head fell back, exposing the torn throat to the silver light. The punctured artery in his neck continued to pump blood in widening puddles. And then the crimson-eyed shadows fell upon him, lips and tongues voraciously consuming the face and throat. Teeth bit at flesh, tearing through and gnawing hungrily on bone; the weight of the things covered him over. He lifted one hand, but it hung useless, in the air, the fingers slowly curling, and then fell back. The room was filled with the noises of their feeding; the grinding of teeth on bone, the sucking at gaping wounds and the tearing away of chunks of flesh. Blood covered the floor, and some of the things bent down to lap at the puddles, maddened and starved for its sweet, strong taste. They began to tear the body to pieces, biting through bone for the marrow and the fluids. They worked faster and faster, more frantically, the sounds of their breathing echoing in the room. The woman whimpered where she lay. They pushed at each other to reach the wounds and when one wound was dry they groped for others, hissing in fury as another pushed them aside. They broke open new rivulets of fluids, like dark wine from fleshy casks. They were impatient and greedy as they feasted, ripping strips of flesh and hoarding them, squeezing out the final drops. And when they were finished with the man, when they had scattered him in grisly pieces and sucked him dry and found they had still not had enough to fill their collapsed veins and arteries, not enough to stop the terrible pain, not to quench the raging fire, they turned with a vengeance upon the woman. She watched them come, some of them walking, some of them dragging themselves across the floor toward her, and she was powerless to move. They were enraged because they were still not filled, not relieved of their inhuman pain, and their teeth were merciless. As they fed on her motionless body, one of the things disentangled itself and rose to its feet. Blood smeared its lips and hands, and as it backed away from the mass of bodies it lifted a palm and licked at the human liquids. It stood in a corner, watching as the others tried to satisfy their hungers. The agony still remained, deep within dried and twisted tissues, within muscles drawn hard as stone, within flesh shrunken and wrinkled around the bones. With each breath the agony welled up, fanning the blaze ever higher. The thing in the corner put a hand to its throat in a vain attempt to still the searing pain. No pulse beat there; the heart had become a lump of decayed matter, and the veins had collapsed like the walls of empty houses. The thing shivered suddenly, in agony and rage and madness and hate. On the wall beside it there was an oval mirror. It turned its head very slowly and peered into the moonlit reflection. The only thing living in that face were the eyes, and those were sunken and terrible, slits of evil in the shriveled head. At one time, an age ago, those eyes might have been cunning and wolflike, full of glory and the blaze of battle. The once aquiline nose was flattened and almost rotted away, now just a pit into which the face was slowly collapsing. Patches of yellow hair clung to the misshapen scalp, and when the thing opened its mouth to scream against its own image, the broken, ragged-edged teeth glittered in the light. The thing lifted up its arms and struck the glass. A crack zigzagged across the mirror, slicing the vision of the corpse\u0027s face into two disjointed parts. It struck again and again, the breath coming harshly through twisted lips; and the mirror began to fall to pieces. When all the glass had broken and the frame was empty, the thing let out a hoarse roar of torment and rage, the scream rising up and up and ending in an empty, choked sob. The others, feeding on the woman\u0027s naked body, heard but did not pause in their feast. Currents of blood shifted around them like ebbing tides, staining the tattered remnants of their brown uniforms. On the front porch of the Indigo Inn, David Moore sat sipping a drink and watched a light far out at sea. A cigarette burned in an ashtray beside his chair; there was a half-empty bottle of rum at his feet. The light came off a freighter, traveling toward the port of a larger island. The sight of it stirred his wanderlust, made him think of distant shores, of people he had known and left behind. His time in Baltimore seemed like someone else\u0027s life now. He had been a different David Moore then, a man naive and unaware in so many, many ways. If there was such a thing as fate, it had moved swiftly in his case, sweeping him along on a path from which he could never hope to find his way back. Nothing could ever alter his own personal tragedy; the scar would always remain, deep and ragged, on his soul. Since the deaths of his wife and son he had determined not to fall in love again, and though he had fallen in love with places and experiences he could never really get close to people again. It was too dangerous. He had been attracted to other women, yes; he had sought sexual encounters just as the women he spent nights with did, but he found it difficult to express his emotions anymore. He knew he drank too much because he was afraid of both life and death; rather, he was suspended between them, his senses still indulging in the multitudinous experiences his travels had offered him, while his deep-seated emotions were numbed and frozen. He was now just the shell of a man who had once run his hands through Beth\u0027s hair and felt the power spark between them like currents of electricity. And yet, in all this time he had only felt himself grow closer to her. Sometimes, locked in a dream, he knew he only had to reach out a few inches and touch her supple naked body, draw her closer to him and hold her so tightly she would never be taken from him again. And thinking of Brian, his son, was just as difficult: What sort of man would he have become? What would it have been like to watch the boy grow up, go to college? God forbid that he would have taken a position at his grandfather\u0027s bank and been stifled just as David had been. No, that was too easy. Perhaps the boy would have been intrigued by the ocean, and would have chosen a life that would have fulfilled him - in ocean engineering, or oceanography, say. Those were fields David might have picked, had not the family decided on his direction in life. He would have made certain that Brian knew there was an entire world of choices; he would have made certain the boy knew his life was his own. Now, when the rum had him and the sea was crashing across the reef, when he sat alone with the night, he couldn\u0027t keep the images at bay very long: he and the boy playing touch-football in a wide, grassy park under fleecy clouds, Beth\u0027s hand reaching for his under a long waxed table during a Thanksgiving dinner at the elder Moore\u0027s estate, the flashing blare of a carnival merry-go-round, and their lips meeting as Brian, on a red-mouthed palamino, clapped his hands and grinned. And after it had happened, after the day of storm and terror, after the doctors had diagnosed his listlessness, insomnia, and, later, fits of rage as \"survivor\u0027s syndrome,\" his father had confronted him in the sitting room of the family home; the old man\u0027s icy eyes had stared at him through a flat haze of blue Cuban cigar smoke. He had not looked at his father, instead remaining intent on the flames that burned within a huge marble hearth. \"If you\u0027re in trouble with the police again, David,\" the old man said finally, his voice a harsh rasp, \"I\u0027m not going to help you. I want you to understand that here and now. Your barroom brawls and destruction of public property have gone far enough.\" The younger man sat in silence; a log shifted, then burst into flame. \"Well? Have you nothing to say to me?\" Moore slowly turned his head; their eyes met, ice against ice, and locked. \"I didn\u0027t ask you to help me last time,\" he said quietly. \"By God, someone had to!\" The old man waved his cigar, knocking off ashes onto the Oriental carpet. \"What was I to do, leave you in jail for the rest of the night, let some goddamned reporter find you in there drunk and do a story about how Horton Moore\u0027s son went wild and shot out every damned traffic light for eight city blocks? Jesus! That would be exactly what my investors would like to see!\" \"Fuck your investors,\" Moore said, in a whisper, too low for his father to hear. \"And you\u0027d be in jail right this minute if I didn\u0027t have a lot of friends at City Hall!\" the old man continued, his eyes blazing. \"My God, boy, what\u0027s to become of you? There are no black sheep in the Moore family; I want you to know that! And I won\u0027t sit here and watch you become one, not while I have breath left in me, I won\u0027t!\" Moore nodded but said nothing; he heard the fire burning and to him it sounded like the noise of the sea over rocks. \"I don\u0027t know, I don\u0027t know,\" his father muttered, spewing out a stream of smoke that curled toward the painting above the mantel. The man in the portrait had another pair of accusing, solemn eyes: those of Moore\u0027s grandfather. \"Maybe because you were my only child, maybe that\u0027s why I\u0027ve been so lenient with you. Maybe I\u0027ve loved you too much, I don\u0027t know... I thank God your mother isn\u0027t alive to see what you\u0027ve become!\" Moore faced his father at last, and the look he gave him was so fierce the old man was silent. \"And what have I become? You\u0027ve tried to make something of me that I never wanted to be; nothing bores me more than the thought of that office, those confining walls, the dead rustle of papers. I was a born executive, isn\u0027t that what you told your associates? An executive in the Moore mold? No. I\u0027m not going back there again.\" \"Then what will you do, you idiot? Goddamn it, that\u0027s what you\u0027ve been educated to do! There\u0027s nothing else for you! My God, I know you\u0027ve been through a bad time, but you\u0027re behaving like a lunatic! They\u0027ve been gone six months, David! They\u0027re not coming back, and there\u0027s nothing else now except putting your nose back to the grindstone and doing what you\u0027re supposed to do!\" \"No,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t.\" \"I see,\" the old man said, nodding; he took the cigar from his mouth and his smile was cool, sarcastic. \"You can\u0027t or you won\u0027t?\" \"Both.\" \"Then if you won\u0027t pull yourself together like a man,\" he said, leaning forward slightly, \"you\u0027re no son of mine. I\u0027ve been wrong about you. I can see that now.\" \"Maybe.\" David Moore stood up; their conversation was coming to an end, as it usually did, like the weakened last blows of weary gladiators. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I am going to do, and it\u0027s something I\u0027ve been thinking over for a long time. I\u0027m going to travel; I don\u0027t care where to. I\u0027m going to keep on moving until I\u0027ve seen what I want to see, and maybe until I find a place I can belong to again. There\u0027s nothing for me here anymore.\" \"Of course. You\u0027re going to run. From me, from yourself. Well, go on and run! I don\u0027t care! Where do you think you\u0027ll run to? What are you looking for, another girl like her...?\" He stopped suddenly; the last word had come out as a half-snarl. His son turned on him, and the heat of his rage made the old man lean back. He closed his mouth, not too obviously because he didn\u0027t want David to think he was frightened. Moore controlled himself and then said, \"When I was a child and knew no better,\" he said, \"you told me how much alike we were. I\u0027m a man now, and I see all the differences.\" \"Then go on,\" the old man told him. \"Run.\" Moore looked once into his father\u0027s face to find the man that was truly there; his father quickly averted his eyes. \"I\u0027d better go now,\" he said finally. \"I\u0027m not holding you here.\" \"No. Not any longer. I\u0027m sorry; I didn\u0027t want to tell you my decision in anger.\" \"What does it matter? You\u0027ve told me.\" There was an awkward silence; Moore stepped forward, lifted his hand toward his father and extended it. \"Good-bye,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll be back,\" the old man said, ignoring his hand. And it was then that David Moore had walked away from that life. He worked his way from country to country, living close to the earth or on a boat at sea, not knowing what drew him on but knowing he had to take that next step, and the next, and the next. He began to have the old nightmares again, the whirling scene of wind and wild ocean and Destiny\u0027s Child breaking into bits beneath him. He began to hear Beth\u0027s voice calling to him over a great distance, fading in and out; sometimes even close to his ear, the whisper of his name and then silence. It disturbed him, but he began to listen for it. At times he doubted his sanity, but sometimes he was certain she stood beside him, trying to reach him, separated only by the barrier between life and death. In a dark clapboard house in Singapore a woman with blackened teeth and the smile of a cat stared at him over a plate of yellowed bones. She reached down and picked them up in her hands, rolled them around and then dropped them back. They were ordinary chicken\u0027s bones, but the woman seemed to see something strange and important in them. A group of sailors from Moore\u0027s freighter had gone with him to see the fortune-teller, and they stood in the shadows that fringed the room. \"He\u0027s going to inherit a fortune, is that it?\" one of them asked jokingly, and the others laughed. \"Fortune, hell,\" said another. \"He\u0027s just going to be lucky enough to get out of this port without a colossal case of the drips.\" \"Someone waits for you,\" the woman said in a high-pitched whine. The men laughed again; crude remarks were flung back and forth. Moore watched the woman\u0027s eyes and believed her. \"No. Two people,\" she said; she lifted the bones again, rolled them, let them fall. \"What the hell are we doing here?\" one of the sailors asked. The woman looked into Moore\u0027s face. \"There is a great distance to be traveled yet,\" she said, wet lips glistening. \"I can\u0027t see where they are. But they will not leave until you find them.\" \"Who are they?\" Moore asked, and as soon as he spoke the men were quiet. \"A woman. Tall. Very beautiful. A man. No. A boy child. They are very confused, and they don\u0027t understand why you can\u0027t hear.\" \"I...\" Moore began, but then stopped himself. \"Is there anything else?\" She rolled the bones, dropped them, and probed as if looking for a particular one. Then she shook her head. \"No. Fate reserves the rest.\" She held out her hand for her money. \"Anyone else?\" she asked. The freighter\u0027s lights had vanished; the horizon was black again and above it hung the separate, fiery dots of stars. Moore crushed out his cigarette. It was hard not to believe, but it was equally hard to believe. He wanted to believe, though; he desperately needed to, perhaps because of his persistent, unnerving feeling about Coquina. That it was the end of his journey. And the questions still to be answered, the ones that had plagued him day and night and sometimes made him cry out because he couldn\u0027t understand. Why had he not died with Beth and Brian? Why had he been saved? Why had he been sent on a path that led... here? To Coquina? To find what? Fate reserves the rest, the old woman had told him. \"Do you mind if I join you?\" Moore turned his head, his reflexes slowed by the effects of the rum. Jana was standing behind him on the porch, wearing a tight white blouse and jeans. He had no idea how long she\u0027d been there. \"Sure,\" he said, and motioned toward another chair beside him. She sat down and put her legs up on the porch railing. Her hair was exactly as he\u0027d imagined it: she wore it loose and it touched her shoulders, softly blond and very attractive. \"It\u0027s quiet,\" she said after a moment of silence. \"Yes, the bars closed early tonight. Usually there\u0027s a lot of noise on a Saturday.\" He glanced over at her, his eyes tracing the fine line of her profile. \"Is your room all right?\" \"It\u0027s fine, thanks.\" She sensed that he wanted to be alone, but she wasn\u0027t about to leave him. \"It\u0027s a shame you don\u0027t have more visitors. I think your island has a lot of potential.\" He grunted. \"For what? Another tourist haven, where they destroy the jungle for a Hilton and a shopping center? It would mean more money coming into Coquina, but there are only a few natural places like this left in the Caribbean. That\u0027s why I bought the hotel and decided to stay on for a while. I wouldn\u0027t have it any other way.\" \"Are you against progress?\" \"Progress, no. Spoilage, yes. A few years ago some businessmen had a plan to build a hotel and marina over on the island\u0027s north point. They dredged out a harbor and started blasting the jungle away with dynamite. They never finished it, and they ruined a perfectly good natural cove.\" \"What made them stop?\" Moore shrugged. \"Money, I suppose. And problems with the Carib Indians, who kicked their night watchmen around and stole their supplies; those people claim that part of Coquina, and they guard it jealously. But I\u0027m glad they didn\u0027t finish. You can keep your Jamaicas and Haitis; Coquina\u0027s better off being left alone.\" There was a pause, and then Jana said, \"I didn\u0027t know I\u0027d touched a nerve.\" Moore glanced over at her, he hadn\u0027t meant to come across that strongly, and he knew it was partly the rum talking. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he apologized. \"I suppose it\u0027s only a matter of time before the tourists move in, but I\u0027m attached to this place. I don\u0027t want it to change.\" \"I can understand your feelings.\" \"Well,\" he said, dismissing the subject with a wave of his hand, \"enough about Coquina. I\u0027m forgetting my manners. Would you like a drink?\" Jana shook her head. \"I don\u0027t drink, but thank you all the same.\" Moore sipped from his glass, listening for a moment to the sound of the ocean rolling across Kiss Bottom. The waves were harsher than usual, and that could mean a storm was building somewhere, chopping up the sea. \"How long have you been with the Foundation?\" he asked her finally. \"A little over a year,\" she said. \"I worked in research for the British Museum after I finished school, and I had the opportunity to dive with Cousteau on the Britannic. That was mostly luck, but it helped me win a position in Kingston.\" \"What exactly does the Foundation do?\" She smiled faintly and nodded toward the open sea. \"That\u0027s my laboratory. Out there are perhaps thousands of sunken wrecks. Some are charted, some aren\u0027t; more are being discovered all the time. We document and study the ones that haven\u0027t been identified. There are perhaps more wrecks in the Caribbean than any one place on earth, so that\u0027s why I tried my damnedest to get the position. Pirate\u0027s galleons, men-o\u0027-war, sailing merchants, steamers, warships; the bottom\u0027s a marine archaeologist\u0027s paradise. What we\u0027re doing is just as much for shipping safety as for the sake of history.\" \"You\u0027re very young to have come so far in your field.\" Jana smiled openly; it was a warm smile, filled with a charm Moore had not seen until now. \"I\u0027ve heard that one before. Believe me, I worked my ass off to get where I am. It\u0027s never been easy - it still isn\u0027t - but I think the work is worth it.\" \"So what are you planning about the submarine?\" Jana\u0027s smile faded at once. She stood up and leaned against the railing, staring out into the night; when she turned back to him he could see the fierce determination in her eyes. \"I\u0027m not going to let that man sink it, if that\u0027s what you mean. He doesn\u0027t seem to realize how valuable it could be. To be perfectly honest, grants to the Foundation from Great Britain haven\u0027t been pouring in for some time; the British Museum seems to be losing interest in our work. Something like this could spark a fire throughout the entire scientific community! No. I\u0027m not going to return to Kingston and tell them I had a risen U-boat in my grasp, in remarkable condition, and let it be sunk right under my nose!\" \"Wait here a second,\" Moore said suddenly, standing up. \"I want to show you something.\" He went to his study, found the scorpion paperweight, and brought it out to her. \"Look at this,\" he said. She stared at the glass object, holding it up to the dim porch light. Her expression was troubled and she seemed agitated. \"Where did you find this?\" she asked quietly, glancing at him and then back to the paperweight. \"Inside the boat; there was a cabin just forward of the control room.\" Jana nodded. \"The commander\u0027s quarters.\" She turned it, examining the letters. Moore saw the color suddenly drain from her face. \"Korrin,\" she said. \"What?\" \"It\u0027s the name here. Korrin. Wilhelm Korrin. Do you see?\" Her eyes were bright with excitement. \"I suppose it could say that, yes.\" \"I know that name,\" she said with finality.

Robert McCammon, who took the premise of vampires in Los Angeles to its natural conclusion by having half the city turned into vampires and unleashed an Allied werewolf loose on a secret Nazi base, can be counted on to accomplish the task. The raising of the Nazi submarine is central to McCammon\u0027s story which delivers surprising twists and bloody confrontations. The U-boat was sunk off a Caribbean island, but under circumstances that leave it largely intact until a diver accidentally dislodges an unexploded depth charge which lets the sand-covered sub bob to the surface. This could result in a nice sale to museum. But soon, it\u0027s decided the sub would be better off back in the Big Drink. The problem is, see, the crew is not dead, thanks to a voodoo curse.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-night-boat.jpg","author":"Robert McCammon","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-boat.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:30 PM"}}
