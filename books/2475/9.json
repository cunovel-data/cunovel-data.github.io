{"id":83058,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"DR. THEODORE MAXWELL, a heavyset black in his mid-fifties, let the blood-spattered sheet drop down over the ruin of a face. He wore a smock smeared with human fluids over his clothes. Rays of morning sunlight streamed in dusky patterns through the drawn blinds of the Coquina clinic examination room. He shook his head, pushed his eyeglasses off the bridge of his nose, and let them rest on top of his balding head. He had seen bad things before: men whose noses had been cut off by rusted razors in barroom brawls, automobile accident victims, the mangled remains of a young child caught in the screw of a trawler. He was familiar with the ugly wounds of life, and familiar as well with the sight of death. But in his experience most people died in their sleep, with an expression of peace and almost of relief. This one was different. This young man who lay before him had seen Hell before he died. Maxwell reached for a clipboard and began to jot notes for later reference. \"What\u0027s your opinion?\" Kip asked wearily, his eyes hollow from lack of sleep. Dr. Maxwell looked up quickly, then went back to his clipboard. He finished writing, then said in a soft, quiet tone of voice that belied the tension he felt, \"Perhaps the most brutal beating I\u0027ve ever seen. All manner of things were used: fists, fingers, some kind of blunt instruments. Maybe a wrench, and there\u0027s indication a hammer was used on his skull.\" Kip frowned, staring at the outline of the corpse. \"Any next of kin?\" Dr. Maxwell asked. \"No. I don\u0027t even know where he was from. He was an island drifter.\" The doctor put his clipboard aside, steeled himself, and lifted the sheet again. The muscles of the face had frozen in that hideous grimace, and Maxwell shuddered as he gazed into those staring eyes again. He took a small penlight from his breast pocket and leaned over the throat. Yes. Those marks were unmistakable. \"What is it?\" Kip asked. Maxwell snapped off the light, returned it to his pocket; he placed the sheet back down. \"This man is missing a great quantity of blood,\" he said, turning toward the constable. \"But I believe he was dead before he received that throat wound.\" \"Then one of the blows to the head killed him?\" \"I\u0027m not sure. I want to go into the chest cavity and look at the heart. The frozen facial muscles, the coloration, the teeth locked through the tongue - all those may indicate instantaneous heart arrest. Perhaps brought on by a sudden and severe shock.\" Kip blinked, letting the words sink in. \"A shock? Fright, is that what you\u0027re saying?\" \"That I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve heard of it happening before, but I\u0027ve never seen it.\" Kip shook his head in disbelief. \"Christ Almighty!\" he said softly. \"What could scare a man enough to kill him?\" He looked into the doctor\u0027s eyes for an answer, but the other man had turned away. Kip crossed the room to a desk with a metal tray which contained items the young man had had in his pockets. A few coins, a small penknife, a rusted key, cigarette papers, and a bit of ganja. And also something the doctor had pried from the corpse\u0027s rigid fingers. It was a few inches of filthy cloth, matted with yellow streaks of fungus. Kip picked it up and held it under the desk lamp to examine it for the third time. At one time the cloth had either been brown or green, but now it was a sickly, faded color somewhere in between. What was it? he wondered. Something Turk had grabbed at during his horrifying ordeal? The constable gathered up the items and buttoned them in the back pocket of his trousers. Coins, a key, enough ganja for a few wild highs; it was one hell of a legacy to leave behind. What a terrible way for any man to die. \"Kip,\" the doctor said quietly, looking from the covered corpse back to the other man. \"What types of wild animals would you say were out in the jungle?\" At first he thought he\u0027d misunderstood Maxwell. Then Kip answered. \"Not many. Maybe a few small boar, and if you\u0027re not counting snakes, that\u0027s it.\" He narrowed his eyes, seeing the puzzled expression on the doctor\u0027s face. \"Why?\" Maxwell folded his arms before him and leaned back against the examination table, keeping his gaze steady. \"There are teeth marks on this man\u0027s throat and on the right cheekbone. Some of them have broken bone, as if... something was trying to get at the bone marrow. All I can think of at this point is some kind of animal.\" What kind of animal would do that? Kip shook his head, ran the back of his hand across his face. No, he knew of no vicious animals in that jungle, though there were probably several places so choked with growth that anything might be hiding in there. He had seen a couple of the boar on occasion, but they were too small to be of any consequence. \"An animal big enough to take on a man?\" Kip asked. \"Impossible, not on Coquina. But... teeth marks? You\u0027re sure it\u0027s not the mark of some kind of tool or something?\" \"Yes.\" Kip took a step toward the corpse and then checked himself, realizing he couldn\u0027t bring himself to look at it again. Teeth marks? No, it didn\u0027t make sense! \"Do this for me, please,\" he said. \"I want you to keep that opinion to yourself. Do whatever you have to, an autopsy or whatever, but I don\u0027t want anyone to know about the marks. At least not until I can figure out what the hell\u0027s going on.\" \"All right,\" Maxwell said, \"I understand.\" He made a move to wheel the table out of the examination room, and as the doctor turned the table around, Kip felt that scrape of nails inside again, and this time a chunk of mortar fell away. He watched the doctor push the table through a pair of doors into a hallway and then into another room. Kip had to get out; his mind was numbed and his senses on edge. Leaving the clinic, he walked in the hot sunlight toward the Square, his brain filled with questions he couldn\u0027t begin to answer. What if there were something out in the jungle that could attack and kill a man by ripping his throat into bloody rags and gnawing on the bone? But then why hadn\u0027t some of the inland farmers seen it? They\u0027d been out there for years, and if an animal like that prowled the jungle at least one person should have seen it. But no, no; Turk had been struck by blunt instruments as well as fists; Maxwell had said so himself. What had probably happened was that someone... or more than one?... had killed the man, leaving the body for the big wharf rats that had eaten through the dead flesh. That made sense, but then how did Turk\u0027s body wind up in the water? Kip was stunned by the brutality of the crime. A murder on Coquina was practically unthinkable. There were always barroom fights, of course, and often those got pretty damned ugly, but murder? Who among the islanders would be capable of such a thing? At once he thought of the Carib Indian men. They were a rough, fierce breed, and whenever they came down to the village, which was fortunately rare, Kip had to wield a billyclub to break up the trouble. The Caribs were hot-blooded people who - island rumor said - had practiced cannibalism on their enemies less than a hundred years before. Was it possible Turk had run into one, or a group of them, who had come down from their settlement to see the submarine? It was all speculation, of course, but maybe worth a drive over to Caribville to ask some questions. No, he decided. It was rats. The rats had crept out and torn into the corpse\u0027s flesh, and that accounted for the teeth marks. Kip saw David Moore\u0027s truck parked over by the hardware supply in the Square. There was a stack of timber in the truck bed, and as Kip approached, Moore came out through the doorway, carrying another load of wood in his arms. He laid the timber down, wiped sweat off his face, and started to go back inside when he saw the constable and raised a hand in greeting. \"Business so good you\u0027re building an addition?\" Kip asked him. \"Not hardly. I\u0027m setting this aside in case we have another blow during the season. The old roof might not take much more this year.\" Kip nodded. There were three elderly men on a porch in front of the hardware store, two smoking pipes and the third just sitting with a straw hat pulled low over his face. They had been talking quietly until the constable had walked over; now they listened, eyes moving from Kip to Moore. Kip greeted them politely and then said to Moore, \"Anything I can help you with?\" \"That should do it, except for paying my bill. If you really want to help you can talk Yarling into extending my credit.\" Kip tried to smile but found it difficult because he couldn\u0027t shake the image of Turk\u0027s dead face; the eyes of the old men were on him and he felt uneasy. \"Sorry. No favoritism.\" \"That\u0027s what I was afraid of.\" Moore dug for his wallet and then turned to go back into the hardware supply. \"Constable,\" said one of the three on the porch, a lanky man with snowy hair and teeth clamped around the bit of a pipe. \"What happen\u0027 to that boy las\u0027 night?\" He leaned forward in his chair, and Moore stopped where he was. \"Never you mind about that,\" Kip told him. \"Is it true what they say?\" one of the others asked. \"About his neck bein\u0027 broke and all the blood gone out his veins?\" \"Whoever told you that has got one hell of an imagination. I\u0027d have to go far to think up a better one.\" Kip kept his voice light and easy, but he was fooling no one; the old men\u0027s eyes were sharp and direct. Moore was watching him, his mouth half-open in astonishment. \"Dan Miles saw the body,\" the man in the straw hat said. \"He say somethin\u0027 got hold o\u0027 that throat an\u0027...\" \"Dan Miles drinks too much, too,\" Kip said, more sharply than he\u0027d intended. \"If listening to lies was a crime I\u0027d throw all of you in jail.\" \"They say somethin\u0027 come out the jungle,\" the man continued. \"Mebbe be somethin\u0027 nobody got the right to see. I seen a jumbie back in there when I was a boy. Him a mean thin\u0027, a tall white thin\u0027 moved so fast you could hardly see. Moved with the wind, and the wind around him go wheeooooo... wheeooooo, like that. I\u0027d seen that face and I ain\u0027t never forgot. Ugly thin\u0027, with bright red eyes and teeth hangin\u0027 out the mouth. I run and I run and I run \u0027cause I wasn\u0027t s\u0027posed to be out there at night, you know? But I seen that face and I ain\u0027t never forgot.\" Kip leaned a hand against a porch slat, keeping his movements casual. \"No such things as jumbies.\" \"I seen the ghost of the Ritter woman long time back,\" the first man who\u0027d spoken added, his eyes wider and brighter. \"Damn me if I didn\u0027t see her over on the fishin\u0027 wharf where her man\u0027s boat used to lie. She wave her arms at me, and I seen the stars shinin\u0027 through her, and she say \u0027Follow me. Follow me.\u0027 And then when I step back, she walk right on off the wharf into the sea and she gone.\" He looked at the other two men, and they nodded appreciatively. \"Kip,\" Moore said, \"what happened last night?\" \"You\u0027d best go pay your bill,\" the constable told him. \"Yarling\u0027s been known to get mean.\" \"Young buck name o\u0027 Turk got hisself killed,\" the one in the straw hat told Moore, sharing the secret. \"It happen\u0027 over in the yard where that dam\u0027 boat be. Thass a bad thin\u0027, constable. Unlucky as all hell. That dead boat draw the jumbies out from the jungle, and they all flock around in there when everybody sleepin\u0027 and they have a hell of a party, all them dead thin\u0027s together. And they laugh and scream and roll them eyes up and they look for the livin\u0027 man \u0027cause they jealous, and they hate the livin\u0027 man and want his soul. And thass what happen\u0027 to that young Turk.\" The other old men had settled back in their chairs, saying nothing, pipe smoke swirling about their heads. \"What happened last night?\" Moore asked again. Kip said, \"Come over to my office when you\u0027re finished here. We\u0027ve got things to talk about.\" He glanced again at the men on the porch and then turned away, crossing the Square toward his office. Kip went inside, drew the blinds, and brought the dead man\u0027s belongings out of his back pocket, laying them together on the blotter on his desk. He sat down, rolling himself a cigarette, and then snapped on his desk lamp. Picking up each item in turn, he examined them under the light; when he came to the rotten cloth he felt a dull throbbing start somewhere inside him, at the pit of his stomach. He traced a finger along the ridges of yellow fungus. This is important, he told himself, but I don\u0027t know why. This is important and I can\u0027t yet understand it. And deep within him, in the hidden recesses, he felt the brick wall tremble, as if something were pushing against it from the dark side. There was a knock on the door. \"It\u0027s open, David,\" Kip said. Moore came in looking puzzled by the secrecy and intrigued by what the old men had been saying. He stepped toward Kip\u0027s desk, seeing the items there on the blotter. \"What\u0027s going on?\" he asked quietly, noting the strained, tired look in his friend\u0027s eyes. \"The submarine was torched open early this morning,\" Kip said. \"A welder for Langstree did it, a crazy fool by the name of Turk.\" \"Did he say why?\" Kip gazed at Moore through a blue haze of cigarette smoke and shook his head. \"No. Someone beat him to death over at the boatyard. I know what he was looking for, though, because just yesterday afternoon he was rambling on about gold bars and a wrecked German ship. I tell you, David, someone did a hell of a job on him, and when they were finished the rats took the rest. It\u0027s possible he got into the hulk, found something, and whoever killed him took it away from him.\" He waved at the items on the blotter. \"This was all we found in his pockets, and this scrap of filthy cloth was gripped in his hand. Could be he ripped at something before he went down.\" Moore was speechless. A murder on Coquina was unbelievable; there had never been a murder while he\u0027d been operating the Indigo Inn. Hell, he\u0027d come to this island because he\u0027d believed it was set apart from all the bitter cruelties of men. Now he realized his fantasy was just that - a ridiculous dream. \"How\u0027d he get into the boat?\" he asked after another moment. \"Torched through a hatch on the forward deck, just in front of the main gun.\" Kip put the items into a plastic bag; he sealed it and put the bag away in a lower drawer. \"He was a drifter; maybe he had enemies, and one of them caught up with him. I don\u0027t know.\" He pulled on the cigarette, then crushed it out in his ashtray. \"Anyway, dead men tell no tales, as they say.\" He pushed his chair back and went over to the storage cabinet, unlocking and opening it. From its recesses Kip withdrew a flashlight and a bull\u0027s-eye lantern; he tossed the flashlight to Moore. \"I\u0027m going to have a look inside the U-boat. Want to come along?\" \"Yes,\" Moore said, taking a deep breath. \"I\u0027d like to see what\u0027s in there.\" \"All right, then. We\u0027ll be taking a chance if there\u0027re live explosives in it, but if a cutting torch didn\u0027t blow anything to hell I figure it\u0027s pretty safe.\" He glanced over toward the gun cabinet, but he quickly dismissed the idea. What was there to arm himself against? The rats? He was certain the shelter was filled with them, but they certainly weren\u0027t man-killers. For God\u0027s sake, he told himself, settle down. He clicked the lantern on and off a couple of times to check the battery and then motioned toward Moore. \"Let\u0027s see what the old relic\u0027s carrying,\" he said, and stepped toward the doorway. \"God only knows,\" Moore said. Yes, Kip told himself, as they stepped out into the harsh white glare of the sun\u0027s eye and Kip climbed into the driver\u0027s seat of the jeep. God and perhaps one other.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-boat/page-9.html","bookId":2475,"book":{"id":2475,"title":"The Night Boat","description":"Storyline: A German submarine is sunk during World War Two. How do you turn this gimmick into a horror novel? Which direction do you go? What\u0027s the creep factor?

The raising of the Nazi submarine is central to McCammon\u0027s story which delivers surprising twists and bloody confrontations. The U-boat was sunk off a Caribbean island, but under circumstances that leave it largely intact until a diver accidentally dislodges an unexploded depth charge which lets the sand-covered sub bob to the surface. This could result in a nice sale to museum. But soon, it\u0027s decided the sub would be better off back in the Big Drink. The problem is, see, the crew is not dead, thanks to a voodoo curse.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-night-boat.jpg","author":"Robert McCammon","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-boat.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:30 PM"}}
