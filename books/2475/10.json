{"id":83059,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"MOORE COULD FEEL the tension radiating from Kip as they passed through the boatyard gates\u0027 broken slats and drove across the yard. Kip was chewing nervously on a match he\u0027d taken from his breast pocket. When they came around a lumber pile Moore saw the other man\u0027s eyes narrow a fraction. There was the shelter and the delapidated wharfs just ahead. As Kip pulled the jeep to a halt alongside the shelter Moore himself began to feel uneasy; he stared at the weathered wall, knowing that behind it was the thing that had lured him down to the depths. It had broken free by his hand. Violence had followed it, marring forever the naive, pure pattern of life on Coquina. Moore thought that the thing\u0027s purpose - giving death - had somehow, horribly, been revitalized. And he had brought it here. Kip climbed out, waving a hand to a few of the men working some distance away on a storm-beaten trawler at the wharf\u0027s end. Turk\u0027s frozen, horrified face burned at the back of his brain. He could see every detail, and for the first time in a very long while he realized that a strange and vague fear crawled inside him. What was it? he asked himself. There\u0027s nothing to fear. It\u0027s irrational, stupid, childish. But something bothered him, something terrible, something he did not want to think about. When he realized Moore was standing beside him, he clicked on his lantern and pushed against the door. It swung open hesitantly, on rusted, whining hinges. A foul darkness lay beyond the doorway, as if they stood on the rim of day and were about to cast themselves on the mercy of the night beyond. The Night Boat, Boniface had called it, Kip thought suddenly. A creature of the night, a thing that used the darkness as a defense. They stepped through into the shelter, Moore following the constable, their lights leading the way. A wall of overpowering stench hit them. \"Jesus,\" Kip said. \"This bastard\u0027s rotting from the inside out.\" He motioned with the light into the sheen of water beneath the gangplank. \"That\u0027s where I found the man. You\u0027ll see the dried blood up around the hatch opening.\" Moore scanned the length of the U-boat. It lay entirely in the darkness except for the stream of murky light that flowed down from the roof holes. The water around the hull was oily and thick, a deep emerald green in which a few bloated fish had met their death. Their carcasses, white bellies up, bumped against the iron, and each slow movement scattered flies that were exploring the decaying flesh. A chill ran up Moore\u0027s back; he could imagine the terrible rumble of the boat\u0027s diesels. God, he thought, what a machine that must have been, gliding through the deep canyons like some kind of sea predator. \"Just a minute,\" Kip said quietly, moving his light past Moore. He focused the beam on a pile of timbers that lay on the forward deck near the hatch. A coil of cable sat against the conning tower, on the port-side deck. He didn\u0027t recall seeing either the cable or the timbers earlier that morning, but then, he couldn\u0027t remember anything very clearly except the dead man\u0027s face breaking water. He moved his light over the cable, then back to the wood. The timbers looked as though they\u0027d been stacked there, haphazardly. Kip probed with the light back in the far shadows, where the carpentry section had been. The timber had been over there the last time he\u0027d seen it. Or had it been? He couldn\u0027t remember. As his light brushed the mound of crates and rags red eyes glittered and they heard the sound of high, panicked squealing. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Moore asked him. Kip shook his head. \"Nothing.\" He stepped into the darkness, away from the warm sunlight, and Moore followed him across the gangplank onto the U-boat\u0027s deck. Moore stepped into something, and drawing back with his flashlight he saw a little heap under the looming bulk of the tower. There were small shattered bones, grisly whiskered heads, curled black tails. A mound of offal, of mangled things that had been fat wharf rats. Glassy gelatinous eyes caught the light and Moore quickly looked away, stepping over them. A cat must somehow have gotten in and out of the shelter. Clots of blood marked the area where the young man had been killed at the yawning circular hole. Kip played his light across them; the splatters looked like brown paint flung wildly from a brush. Beneath them the plankings creaked softly, and the rustling of the rats filled the shelter with echoes. And then the two men aimed their lights down into the hole. A ladder descended into the boat, but there seemed no room to move around in there. Moore bent lower and shined his light in at varying angles. Pipes, bare bulkheads, thick bundles of cables, all illuminated briefly and then reclaimed by the dark. Beneath the opening he could see rusted floor platings and a sheen of water perhaps three inches deep. He saw his reflection there, a shadow without form or face. Kip, his teeth clenched around the match, his breath coming in short gasps, lowered himself carefully through the opening, his feet groping below for the rungs. He stepped onto the floor plates, splashing water, and waited for Moore to join him. They stood in a narrow, cramped chamber filled with pipes, flywheels, and complex machinery. Kip swung his light around and motioned. There were four sealed torpedo tubes at the bow, with hatches the size of upended kettle drums. Two torpedoes seemed to rise up from the floor plates on iron tracks; thick clumps of dried black grease, veined with a greenish fungus, clotted the tracks, but the torpedoes themselves seemed almost clean. Moore ran a hand along one of them. \"Careful,\" Kip cautioned, the sound of his voice an eerie noise that rang from one bulkhead to the next. He moved his light again, illuminating the thin, fungus-coated mattresses which had been hung on chains so they could be folded back when not in use. A narrow path led between the bunks into the black guts of the U-boat. Beneath the bottom bunks were more torpedoes, secured in place with metal clamps. Kip shined his light on the bulkheads; there were photographs, badly faded and hardly recognizable, still in place among the mattresses. A young dark-haired woman stood in the midst of an amusement park, smiling; a middle-aged man and woman embraced on a bench with a fountain in the background; there was a postcardlike photo of a huge house surrounded by woods; a pretty blond woman stood on skis, against a backdrop of snow-covered mountains, and waved to a lost love. The lights revealed crates stowed in every possible nook and cranny. A bucket had overturned, spilling out something that resembled thick, whitish globs. Everything was covered with the sickly hues of decay; a shoe, caught in the miniature swells made by the men\u0027s movements, bumped against one of the stored torpedoes. Moore lowered his flashlight and saw what was left of a shirt, coiled like an octopus in a shadowy corner. Moore thought: And what happened to whoever wore that? Kip sloshed through the water, bent down and picked at the shirt. It fell into pieces in his hand, covering his fingers with a yellowish residue. He held a scrap of it before the light as if mesmerized by it, and then abruptly let it drop back into the water. The shirt fragments floated out of sight beneath a bunk. Kip wiped his hand on a trouser leg. A passageway stretched ahead of them. The air seemed putrid and thick here; Kip found it difficult to draw a full breath. There had probably been no air at all in here until that hatch was torched through, and not enough had circulated yet. Over the graveyard stench there was another odor: cloying, sickly sweet, harsh on the lungs. Some kind of noxious gas? Something that had been collecting inside here for forty-odd years? Kip waited until Moore\u0027s light caught up with his and then he crouched forward, ducking under pipes, and started into the corridor. The darkness seemed to gnaw away at the lights, and up ahead small shadows scurried for safety. The men couldn\u0027t walk side-by-side because the corridor wasn\u0027t wide enough. It was like crawling down the throat of a huge beast into the sodden entanglement of tissues and organs and bone. \"Jesus,\" Moore said softly, hearing his voice jump back at him, \"it\u0027s hard to breathe in here. It\u0027s a claustrophobic\u0027s nightmare.\" There was a large central pipe above them that wound its way through the boat like a rusted spine. Kip shined his light through one of the openings off to the side, toward a cramped storage space filled with crates, two more bare mattresses, and a table bolted to the floor plates. A row of white shirts hung from the ceiling, and more lay in water. He moved on, his shoes stirring swirls of rust and filth from the plates. The crewmen had gone about their duties here, all part of the efficient mechanism, like cogs in a terrible weapon. But how they managed to keep their sanity in this place day after day, week after week was beyond comprehension. The smell of humanity, of sweat, of cigarette smoke and urine mingled with the stenches of diesel oil and fuel must have been all but overpowering. Even now Moore felt trapped, as if the bulkheads and ceiling were gradually closing in on him, and he was walking downhill instead of straight ahead. What had started as an irritation had become a raw burning at the back of his throat, and when he drew in a guarded half-breath his lungs were seared. He heard Kip cough violently once, then again. Moore leaned inside the next opening, probing with the flashlight as Kip moved on ahead. On a metal table there was a radio console; a set of headphones dangled from wires, and a chair had been overturned. The shadows were deep and thick, clinging to the corners like solid cobwebs; they resisted the thin spear of light. Rising off the rotted debris in the water was that terrible crypt smell, dry and sweet. Moore drew back, inhaling sharply. He was about to rejoin Kip when he thought he heard something move. He froze, listening. There was only the sound of Kip moving ahead, sloshing water. The echoes were merging, doubling and tripling, vibrating full force off the bulkheads. Moore flashed his light into that radio room again. A pulpy mass bumped against the back of the chair, and it took him another moment to realize it was more torn rat carcasses, entrails floating behind. Rats down here? What had they done, gotten down into the boat after the hatch had been opened, lured by the smells of fetid food? But they were all mangled, ripped to pieces like the ones piled on the deck. He shuddered. How had that occurred? What in God\u0027s name had done that? Moore backed away from the cabin, feeling the ooze of the water at his feet; he shined the light back in the direction they\u0027d come. The sound he\u0027d heard had been the noise of something moving back down the passageway; he knew he hadn\u0027t imagined it. He kept his light steady for a few more seconds, and then he began to move toward his friend. Kip was examining the filth that floated around him: articles of tattered clothing - shirts, underwear, shoes - empty crates. There was part of a magazine, showing a picture of a girl coyly hiking a skirt up over a thigh. There was a date on it: November 1941. Racy stuff for that time, Kip thought. He was about to move on when a feeling of dizziness swept over him; he thrust a hand out against iron to keep himself from failing face-forward. Black spots swirled before his eyes and his lungs seemed filled with fire. Moore caught his shoulder. \"Are you all right?\" \"Just a minute,\" Kip said thickly, trying to catch his breath. \"There\u0027s bad air in here, David.\" He shook his head, waiting for the spots to clear. \"Okay. I\u0027m better now.\" \"Can you go on?\" Kip nodded, looking ahead. Beyond the narrow beams of light the darkness was clinging and ominous, like something hideous and alive. On either side, fungus and rust had scrawled strange multicolored patterns. The boat was a fester of decay. Moore felt filthy and contaminated; his throat was burning but he made an effort to suppress the urge to cough. Oddly, he feared making more noise than was necessary. The lack of oxygen and the fumes were beginning to take their toll. Kip was sweating profusely, the droplets running down his arms and beading up on his face. He wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, wondering what it was that frightened him so much about being inside here. It was only a machine... a machine of war, yes... but now only a dilapidated relic of days past. It was not the closeness of the place, or the darkness, or the sense of being buried alive. No. It was something else, a sixth sense he had and had possessed all his life, that was now trying to whisper to him, to reach into his soul and shake it. Kip\u0027s light moved past more openings on each side and came to rest on the outline of a sealed iron hatch farther down the passage. His legs began moving, sluggishly, and carried him to that hatch as if he were drawn to it. It was not closed after all, but cracked open an inch or so. An empty crate lay in his path and he pushed it aside. Before him was the grisly, crushed body of a large rat. Flesh still clung to the head and front half of the thing, but its hind quarters and stomach had been ripped away, leaving bare bone, as if something had been gnawing greedily at the carcass. Get out, he heard a whispering voice say; his skin crawled, writhing on his spine and arms. Get out while you can. Moore stepped to one side of the passage and drew back the remnants of a green curtain; it fell away, across his arm. There was a bunk, a small writing table with a mold-smeared blotter, a few metal lockers. There was a paperweight, amid a clutter of old books and papers on the table, and Moore held it up to the light. It was a heavy glass cube, and a scorpion was frozen at its center. The gold letters etched across it, some of them chipped away by time, spelled out: WIL E M KO RIN, SEPTEMB R 1941. And directly beneath, a portion of a swastika. \"Kip,\" he said quietly. \"Look at this.\" Kip turned from the hatch and came over, shining the light around the small cubicle. He examined the paperweight for a moment and then handed it back to the other man. \"I\u0027d say this must have been the commander\u0027s quarters,\" he said, his voice sounding hollow. \"You\u0027d best keep that. It\u0027s probably all you\u0027ll get to salvage off this goddamned crate.\" Moore slid it beneath his shirt. It was like the touch of ice against his flesh. Kip focused his attention on the hatch again. He slid his fingers into the crack and pulled at it; steel grated across steel, but the hatch came open more easily than he expected. Wiping the sweat from his eyebrows, he aimed the light inside. \"David...\" Kip said, hoarsely, not moving from where he was. He didn\u0027t think Moore had heard, so he called again, more loudly this time. \"What is it?\" Moore stood next to him and peered through, following his beam as it crept across the flooring. They were staring into the control room, the U-boat\u0027s heart. At the ceiling hung a mass of pipes, flywheels, and tubing. There were banks of controls, rows of gauges and dials. The glass caught Kip\u0027s light and glinted back. In the center of the room stood a chart table, surrounded by machinery and more gauges, their needles frozen in place. Equipment took up almost every inch. It was suspended from the ceiling in clusters, jammed into the corners: multiple rows of toggle switches, levers, flywheels, blank-faced dials. And something else. The corpses. Some of them were still at their stations, obedient to a long-dead commander, but now they wore the rags of uniforms; they were the ghost crew of a dead boat. And they had been mummified. One whose face was half-covered by a white veil of fungus had crossed his brown, shriveled arms on a table before him; a grinning, eyeless mask stared into their lights from the aft shadows; bone showed in a misshapen skull. Here were empty brown eye sockets, here one with the nose rotted away and the facial features collapsed around a cavernous hole. On the flooring, washed by less than an inch of water, a corpse stared directly at them, its mouth a straining O, broken teeth showing. More littered the rear of the control room, lying singly or in groups, some with facial features still distinct, others coated with yellow and gray fungus, which had covered them like a thick and creeping leprosy. The lack of oxygen had helped to preserve the bodies, had mummified them and left their flesh brown and crusty-looking. Skin was stretched tight over bones and tendons, and the dark eye sockets were deep, fathomless pits in front of solidified brain matter. In one corner a corpse held up both stiffened arms before its face, as if trying to hide from the lights. Kip released his breath from between clenched teeth. Moore could feel the tension holding his own body upright. Kip\u0027s stomach was churning from the reek of decay. He coughed, the pain throbbing in his tissues. What was it? Gas, vapors oozing from the guts of the U-boat, from the aft section where the diesel engines lay? It was an airless crypt, an iron coffin that had taken these men to their deaths. There was an opening at the far end of the death-chamber; the men aimed their lights into it but they could see nothing except a murky curtain of black. \"Must be other bodies back through here,\" Kip heard himself say, realizing they were the first words to be spoken in this terrible place for nearly half a century. \"Could be they were trapped in the aft section when this bastard headed down, and none of them could get out.\" Moore shivered involuntarily, moving his light from corner to corner. The drawn, hideous faces stared back, as if watching them. The darkness seemed to be closing around him. The cone of light was a weapon of protection he held before him. The beam glinted across a bronze plaque mounted on a bulkhead: KIEL - 1941. As he stared at it the lettering faded out of focus, and every breath he took seemed to draw the stench of decay deeper within him. He wiped his face, his skin cold and clammy. He could barely move his hand from his face, as if suddenly paralyzed. \"Let\u0027s get the hell out of here,\" Kip said, but the words were distant, muffled sounds. Kip coughed violently into his hand, and had to support himself again in the frame of the hatch. And then something in the aft section, beyond the range of their lights, clattered. The sharp sound of iron against iron riveted the men, raising the hair on their necks, causing their hearts to pound with the fear of the unknown. \"Jesus,\" Moore whispered. \"Jesus, what was...\" \"Back away,\" Kip said, slurring his words. \"Back away from...\" And then the hammering, the frenzied clattering of hellish noise, exploded through the aft opening and pounded at the two men before they could get away, the echoes building, sweeping wildly past them, filling the boat with more echoes, and more, a thousand others a hundred thousand others and no escape from it no way to get out get out get out get out... \"GET OUT!\" Kip shouted, his voice lost. He couldn\u0027t see; the black motes had obscured his vision, and he could no longer make out his light. Moore reached for him, slowly, too slowly, grasping the man\u0027s elbow and trying to pull him away from the hatch opening. The entire boat seemed to vibrate, and Moore heard something like the shrieks of the damned roaring in the passageway just above his head. He twisted around, staring into the control room, gritting his teeth in terror. Things stirred within, uncoiling themselves like reptiles rising from the water. A wave of cold, pure hatred hit the men like an icy blast. Moore could see the inhuman forms reaching out with black-taloned fingers, ruined faces gaping, black eyeholes now red and hungry. Moore pulled Kip back, shouting out but not knowing if he actually had because he couldn\u0027t hear himself. He threw his full weight against the hatch, forcing it closed, and as he did he saw the greedy mouths open and the teeth glitter. Kip had turned and was staggering back down the passage, flailing at the unseen with his light. Moore started after him, tripping over a crate and falling to his knees in the water, losing his flashlight. He struggled up, dripping, trying to hold back the panic about to burst out of him. He fought on, locked in the nightmare, his feet thickened in the cement hold of the water. God what was it God what was it MY GOD WHAT WAS IT! He opened his mouth to cry out but all that emerged was a dry, dusty rattle, like the voice of something long buried. GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT... Kip, almost blind with terror, tripped, slamming his head against a pipe. He struck out with his arm, cracking the bull\u0027s-eye lantern against metal. It flickered to a dim yellow. And in the shadows that lay beyond him, between the two men and the way out, something was rising up, a skeletal thing with a half-consumed rat clutched in one clawlike hand. Kip tried to warn Moore, but he was struck dumb and frozen with fear. The thing\u0027s other hand came up quickly, and an object flew at Kip\u0027s face from the blackness, turning end over end, whistling as it passed his head. The hammer slammed into a bulkhead and bounced off even as Kip steeled himself and threw his lantern at the walking corpse. There was a sharp crash of shattering glass and then the darkness claimed all. Moore reached Kip and they stayed together, moving as rapidly as they could toward the bow section, still dazed and staggering. The light was growing stronger, the noises of hatred and madness falling behind. The open deck hatch was ahead, and the ladder. Moore grasped it and hurtled up into the rush of clean, pure air. He fell across the deck, the strength drained from him, and crawled toward the railing like a madman. Behind him Kip, his face a tight, drawn mask, rocketed up and slid the heavy hatch lid back over the hole to seal it. He threw himself across it, breathing raggedly, shivering and unable to stop. He thought he must be losing his mind. \"No,\" he protested in a raw, pained voice. \"NO!\" Moore reached the port railing and leaned over, vomiting into the water. \"What was that?\" he said, wiping his face. Then he demanded in a choked whisper, \"WHAT WAS THAT?\" Kip listened. No sounds, no movement. He couldn\u0027t stop shaking; his body was out of control. \"They\u0027re dead...\" he spat out finally. \"They\u0027re DEAD!\" And then the echo, coming up around them, engulfing them with a word that seemed strange and terrible. And untrue.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-boat/page-10.html","bookId":2475,"book":{"id":2475,"title":"The Night Boat","description":"Storyline: A German submarine is sunk during World War Two.
