{"id":83076,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Robert McCammon Tells How He\n Wrote The Night Boat\n The Night Boat was the second novel I wrote, but the third one published. If you\u0027d like to know why that was, write me a letter and I\u0027ll be glad to tell you a tale of dark and twisted passages.\n The Night Boat actually had its beginnings in a drawing of a dinosaur that scared the jelly out of me as a kid. It showed an aquatic beast with a mouthful of gleaming teeth emerging from dark water to snap at a pterodactyl\u0027s leg, the full moon shining down and gleaming off the white-capped waves. Long after everyone else in the house had gone to sleep, I lay in bed and heard the sound of waves on prehistoric shores, and the thrashing of a huge and hideous body emerging from the depths. The hero in The Night Boat, David Moore, remembers the same drawing.\n I also am fascinated by machines. Particularly ships and submarines. I can imagine nothing more grim than to be two hundred feet underwater in a leaking, moldering submarine. They didn\u0027t call them Iron Coffins for nothing, and it took iron-willed men to survive in them. Most of the German submarine crews didn\u0027t.\n The Night Boat is a mixture of dream and nightmare. A dream in that the location, the colors, the language are idyllic; nightmarish because the Night Boat invades the dream and destroys it. I took scuba-diving lessons in researching The Night Boat, but I wasn\u0027t able to afford a trip to the Caribbean. It amazes me still that a review I got for the book went to lengths to say how accurate the reviewer thought I\u0027d gotten the cadences of island language. I listened to many hours of calypso music and spoken Caribbean dialect records.\n Events and impressions in an author\u0027s everyday life are always mirrored in the work he or she is doing at the time. While I was writing The Night Boat, I lived in a cramped little roachhole of an apartment on Birmingham\u0027s Southside. Honestly, I could hear the roaches running wild in the ceiling over my bed as I tried to sleep. And my upstairs neighbors played their stereo at an ungodly volume all hours of the night, so round about two or three in the morning you could hear the other neighbors banging on their walls to get the music shut down. That weird, rhythmic hammering in the early hours remained with me and found its way into The Night Boat. When the crew hammers at the rotting hulk of the submarine, it\u0027s actually irate neighbors at two o\u0027clock in the morning trying to get Led Zeppelin silenced. The roaches in the ceiling I saved for another book.\n Now, eight or nine years after The Night Boat was first published, I think often of Coquina Island. It is a beautiful place, surrounded by emerald water, with fresh trade winds and golden sand, green palms swaying in the breeze, the scent of cinnamon and coconut in the air. It was created by a young man whose apartment looked out over a junk car lot, the smell of burned onions wafting from somebody\u0027s kitchen, and burglar bars on the windows. Ah, the luxury of the imagination...\n The Night Boat is about the merging of dream and nightmare, confinement and escape, and what I think of as the whirlpool of Fate. David Moore thought he\u0027d escaped that whirlpool, but it was waiting for him, there below the surface of emerald waters, where the monsters doze but never sleep.\n Robert McCammon\n June 1988 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-boat/page-27.html","bookId":2475,"book":{"id":2475,"title":"The Night Boat","description":"Storyline: \n A German submarine is sunk during World War Two. How do you turn this gimmick into a horror novel? Which direction do you go? What\u0027s the creep factor? Robert McCammon, who took the premise of vampires in Los Angeles to its natural conclusion by having half the city turned into vampires and unleashed an Allied werewolf loose on a secret Nazi base, can be counted on to accomplish the task. The raising of the Nazi submarine is central to McCammon\u0027s story which delivers surprising twists and bloody confrontations. The U-boat was sunk off a Caribbean island, but under circumstances that leave it largely intact until a diver accidentally dislodges an unexploded depth charge which lets the sand-covered sub bob to the surface. This could result in a nice sale to museum. But soon, it\u0027s decided the sub would be better off back in the Big Drink. The problem is, see, the crew is not dead, thanks to a voodoo curse.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-night-boat.jpg","author":"Robert McCammon","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-boat.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:30 PM"}}
