{"id":83068,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"KIP RAISED THE HAMMER, brought it sharply down on a nail; another blow and the nailhead was flush with the plank. He reached for a third piece of wood from a pile lying next to the shelter wall and carefully hammered it into place across the closed door. Kip pulled at the timber reinforcement, decided another was needed, and hammered until the door was sealed tight. He stepped back a few paces, wiping the moisture from his forehead.\\n\\n He was soaked with sweat from his efforts and exhausted from carrying the planks across the boatyard. He stood where he was for a moment, staring at the blocked doorway. He needed a chain, a thick chain to pull across the door. And a padlock, something heavy and tough. There must be a length of chain here somewhere, he thought, or else I could get one off a boat moored in the harbor. But the shelter must be sealed. It must be sealed so nothing... so none of them... can get out. Another timber, he thought. Nail another timber in place there at the bottom of the door.\\n\\n \"Hey! What in God\u0027s name are you doin\u0027 there!\"\\n\\n Kip tensed, turned toward the voice. A heavyset black in denims and a bright-blue shirt was walking quickly and purposefully across the yard. The man was almost bald except for tufts of white hair on both sides of his head, and his eyes were wary, untrusting. He clenched a pipe between his teeth, and trailed gray whorls of smoke behind him. Kip stood where he was, the hammer still in his hand, and watched Kevin Langstree approach.\\n\\n The boatyard owner stopped abruptly, his eyes moving from the hammer to the timbers and back again. \"What do you think you\u0027re doin\u0027?\" he asked, not taking the pipe from his mouth.\\n\\n Kip moved past him, laying the hammer down on the jeep\u0027s rear floorboard, beside the loaded rifle he\u0027d brought along as a measure of safety. Langstree snorted in anger, stepped forward, and wrenched at the timbers.\\n\\n \"STOP THAT!\" Kip yelled angrily.\\n\\n Langstree whirled on him, teeth bared. \"You lost your mind? Goddamn it, what goin\u0027 on here, mon?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve sealed the shelter,\" Kip said evenly, \"so no one can get in.\"\\n\\n \"And I know what you got in there, too! Oh, yeah, Cochran told me all about it this mornin\u0027! I know you got that bastard boat in there! Now you listen to me! I own this yard... ain\u0027t nobody else own it but Kevin Langstree! What damn right you got to use my yard while I\u0027m away?\"\\n\\n \"I had to get the boat out of the harbor...\"\\n\\n \"I DON\u0027T WANT TO HEAR THAT FUCKIN\u0027 STUFF!\" Langstree yanked the pipe out of his mouth; he was trembling with rage, and Kip fully expected the man to strike him. \"You got no right, no right at all! Any other boat maybe okay... but NOT THAT ONE!\" He motioned with a hand toward the shelter. \"YOU KNOW WHAT THAT THING DONE TO ME? Do you? Blew my yard to bits forty years back, set it afire, and killed a score of my best men! Those men died bad - crushed by metal, burned to crisps, torn apart - and me standin\u0027 there in the middle of it, watchin\u0027 the hell come down on us! No, mon, I can\u0027t forget that! AND NOW THE GODDAMN THING BACK AGAIN! I don\u0027t know where from, or how, but by God I want it out of my yard!\" He turned again toward the doorway and began to pull at the timbers. There was a crack as one of the nails came loose.\\n\\n Kip grasped Langstree\u0027s shoulder; he said in a grim, forceful voice, \"I told you not to do that.\"\\n\\n There was heat burning behind Kip\u0027s eyes. The boatyard owner started to tell Kip to get away from him, but he thought better of it and took his hands from the timbers. \"This is still my yard, by God...\" he began.\\n\\n \"Your yard, yes,\" Kip said. \"My island.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t have you tellin\u0027 me what I can and can\u0027t do, mon, no matter if you the law here or not! I\u0027m away a week and the whole place gone to hell... this goddamn boat in here, my supply shed broke open and God knows what all stolen, everybody scared and not wantin\u0027 to even come to their doors...\"\\n\\n \"What was stolen from your supply shed?\" Kip asked him, a note of urgency in his voice.\\n\\n Langstree paused, searching the other man\u0027s eyes. \"Take a walk over there and you see, by God! The whole thing broke into, crates of oil, rope, timbers, barrels of fuckin\u0027 diesel fuel gone. I don\u0027t know what else - marine batteries, heavy-duty cable...\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it was requisitioned while you were gone?\"\\n\\n \"Hell, no! Ain\u0027t no way that much stuff be used in a week\u0027s time. We just got paintin\u0027 and patchin\u0027 jobs in the yard now... That\u0027s heavy stuff been stolen, right out from under your damn eyes!\"\\n\\n Kip caught the man\u0027s collar. \"Now you listen to me, Langstree,\" he said very quietly. \"You do as I say and leave the shelter alone. We\u0027re towing the U-boat out in the morning and sinking it, but for now just leave it alone! DO YOU HEAR WHAT I\u0027M SAYING?\"\\n\\n The other man nodded, frightened by Kip\u0027s intensity. He pulled free of the constable\u0027s grasp and stepped back a few paces. \"You crazy, mon, you crazy as all hell!\"\\n\\n But Kip had already turned away. He climbed into his jeep and started the engine. Leaving Langstree standing there alone, he wheeled past the shelter and raced back for the village, anxious to get home and make sure his wife and daughter were safe. Kip felt infected by a strange madness, a fear that threatened to rise up and crush him. He had caught a glimpse of the truth today, and he realized how powerless he was to prevent what would happen. Oil, Langstree had said. Barrels of diesel fuel, ropes, cable. And batteries. God, no. He had seen the truth in Cale\u0027s mad stare, in the half-consumed corpse of Johnny Majors, in the remains of the Nazi U-boat sailor lying on a bare plank floor. And now, worst of all, in the theft of marine supplies from the unguarded shed.\\n\\n In all the world there was one man who might be able to help.\\n\\n Boniface.\\n\\n Driving along the jungle road to the airstrip with the woman on the seat beside him, Moore could smell a storm in the air - a damp smell, full of heat, and the breezes had died completely. The entire sky was a gray, featureless canopy, the sun hidden, the clouds hanging motionless over Coquina. Jana had awakened more angry at Kip than she had been the day before, and he could still see her anger working in her face. She had hardly spoken to him this morning, just insisting she had to check her plane before sending her message to Kingston. Now, as Moore drove into the clearing, he saw the airplane ahead; it was still as they\u0027d left it. But as he pulled up beside it he realized he was wrong.\\n\\n \"JESUS!\" she cried out, leaping from the cab even before Moore had braked. She ran alongside the plane, and Moore followed.\\n\\n \"Goddamn it!\" Jana raged, tears of anger springing up quickly and streaking her cheeks. She ran a hand along the jagged dents in the plane\u0027s fuselage. The canopy glass had been broken out; in the front were the smashed remains of the instrument panel; wires hung loose, and the seats were ripped. She shook her head in disbelief and rushed past Moore to the open engine cowling. Moore saw the confusion of torn wires, cables and plugs missing. Someone had completely wrecked the plane. Jana slammed the cowling shut and stepped back, trembling. \"Vandalism!\" she said. \"Pure goddamned vandalism and in the meantime Mr. Kip is sitting his ass in the village! He thinks he\u0027s such a hotshot, telling people what they can and can\u0027t do, and meanwhile he can\u0027t even maintain law and order!\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand it,\" Moore said. \"There\u0027s no reason anyone would...\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll take days to fix this engine,\" the young woman raged, \"if I can even get parts out here! Somebody\u0027s going to pay for this mess!\"\\n\\n Moore motioned toward the farmhouse beyond the strip. \"Maybe they heard or saw something during the night. Come on.\" He reached out to take her arm and she jerked away, then stalked along after him to the truck.\\n\\n Silence hung like a storm cloud over the clapboard house. There was an empty pen, a shed, a square of tobacco plants. On the porch was a bicycle frame without tires, and to one side of the house the hulk of an old car. The trees clustered above like a painted green ceiling, and only a few yards away the jungle grew wild.\\n\\n Moore and Jana climbed a couple of cinder-block steps to the porch. There was a screen door and beyond that the front door, which was wide open.\\n\\n \"Hello!\" he called into the house. \"Anyone home?\" He waited, expecting a reply. He thought he heard an odd drone, like the buzzing of insects, but he wasn\u0027t sure.\\n\\n Jana reached past him and knocked on the door. \"Is anyone there, for God\u0027s sake?\"\\n\\n But Moore had located the insect noise; he moved to the far side of the porch and looked down. Then he stiffened and stepped back a pace.\\n\\n Jana reached him. \"What is it?\"\\n\\n A dog lay on the ground, where it had probably been trying to squeeze its way under the porch. The head was almost severed from the body, and circles of flies groped around the gaping wound. In the animal\u0027s midsection there was a second wound, exposing intestine. The hind legs had been torn away and the bones gnawed clean. \"God...\" Jana said quietly.\\n\\n Moore shuddered and returned to the door. He opened it and stepped into the front room.\\n\\n Chairs were overturned, tables shattered; glass had been broken from windows and lay glittering on the floor. \"Watch your feet,\" Moore told Jana as she came in behind him. And then his heartbeat quickened. He felt a crawling sensation at the base of his spine, and he knew they were not alone.\\n\\n Jana fought the urge to cry out, because suddenly the odor of blood had come to her, as strong as the taste of rusted metal in her mouth. She wanted to avert her eyes but couldn\u0027t, and she stared at the body huddled in the corner.\\n\\n It was the corpse of a middle-aged black man; the face registered a look of shock and horror unlike any Moore had ever before imagined. The top of the head had been peeled back, a hideous mass of ravaged tissue remaining, and the throat was ripped open just as the dog\u0027s had been. His right arm had been snapped off at the elbow and the ulna and radius both shattered as if something had tried to get at the marrow. A trail of smeared blood led from the room, along a hallway and through another open door.\\n\\n Moore moved forward cautiously, his heart hammering in his chest; Jana stood where she was for a few seconds, staring at the strange pattern the blood had made on a plastered wall, waiting for the surge of nausea to either flood over or pass. At last she took a breath of air with her teeth clenched, trying futilely to strain out the death smell.\\n\\n The second room, the kitchen, had been wrecked as well; it had no door, and only a few shattered windows. Utensils lay scattered about on the floor and there was a lot of blood but no more bodies. Looking at the scene of violence and murder, Moore felt a nameless, vaporish dread settle on him, as if something were whispering a message to him that he couldn\u0027t quite understand. He shuddered. What had happened here? His mind dismissed the question abruptly, for the sake of his own sanity.\\n\\n Jana\u0027s eyes searched his face. \"What in the name of God...?\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Moore said quickly. He grasped her arm, tightly. \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\" He stepped away from the window.\\n\\n And it was then that the shadow fell across them, a thing framed in the doorway, reeking of rot and blood, claws lunging for Moore\u0027s throat.\\n\\n Moore flung Jana backward and she screamed in utter terror; the thing grasped him, nails sinking into his neck, its weight bearing down on him. It hissed and drew back decayed lips from its yellow fangs. Moore struck at the thing wildly, trying to force it back, but it had him in its grip now, and in the nightmarish eye sockets he saw the red, volcanic fury of hatred.\\n\\n He crashed to the floor with an impact that almost knocked the breath from him; the thing, its once-human face a rotted horror streaked with fungus, struck Moore\u0027s head against the floor and then, mouth gaping, straddled his torso to rip his throat away. Moore pushed against the sunken chest, feeling bones and hardened intestine, but he was weakened by the blow to his head. The darkness spun past his face like black trails of mist. He saw the mouth opening, opening, the points of teeth descending for the jugular vein.\\n\\n Jana was on her knees immediately, crawling forward. She threw aside the kitchen utensils, desperate for the object she knew must be there, and then her hand closed around it: a large, sharp-bladed butcher knife. She saw the thing\u0027s teeth about to close on Moore\u0027s throat, and she had no time to think; she tensed herself and leaped forward, grasping at the horror\u0027s face with one hand and with the other driving the knife into its back, using all the power she could summon.\\n\\n The body shuddered beneath her; pieces of flesh came away in her hand, and the stench of rot choked her. She screamed in fear and anger, pulling the knife out and driving it in again, out, in, out, in, feeling the body begin to tense. Somewhere, she knew, this walking corpse must feel pain. Her forearm ached with the force of her blows, and as she wrenched at the face she felt something - the remnants of a nose, a cheek, or a lip - tear away.\\n\\n And with the next solid plunge of the knife the thing shrieked - a high, hoarse sound driving through its throat - and reared up, knocking the woman backward. She lost her grip on the knife and it remained planted in the thing\u0027s back, just below the left shoulder blade. Moore shook his head dazedly, crawled away, and watched as the nightmare collapsed to its knees, vainly trying to reach the knife; it shook its head from side to side, like a dying animal, its mouth opening but uttering no sound. It flopped on its belly and began to squirm and shudder as it crawled for the doorway, its breath quickening, the fetid smell filling the room. The thing lay full-length, one hand inching very slowly toward the door frame, trying to pull itself into the corridor. Then it expelled a long, terrible hiss and lay motionless, its arm still thrust out, fingers grasping at the frame, its body sprawled in a broken S-shape.\\n\\n Jana heard herself screaming; she couldn\u0027t stop, even though the noise was frightening her, as if someone else were screaming at a distance, louder, louder, louder, more uncontrollably. Is that me? she heard herself say. Is that me is that me is that me screaminggggggggggg...\\n\\n \"JANA!\" Moore said harshly, shaking her. \"JANA!\" He wrenched her around and she abruptly stopped screaming; she looked at Moore as if she didn\u0027t know who he was or where they were or what had just happened. He put a hand to his throat, feeling the marks of the nails welling up on his flesh, and looked again at the corpse. Standing up, bracing himself against a wall, he moved toward it and then pulled the knife from its grip. There was no blood on the blade, no blood around the dead thing on the floor. It was totally dry, a thing without life fluids. He put the toe of a shoe under it, grasped the remnants of a shirt, and turned it over onto the back. That red fire he\u0027d seen burning in the sockets was gone; all that remained was empty darkness. The skull grinned at him, its lips still pulled away from the teeth, a mockery of both life and death.\\n\\n Staring into those hollow sockets, Moore realized the U-boat\u0027s legacy. They were condemned to a life-in-death, a torment of souls suspended in decaying flesh. Some unholy power had kept them alive, as living corpses in an iron coffin... and he had helped free them from the crypt.\\n\\n Jana had to search to find her voice. \"What... is it...?\" she whispered, unable to stop trembling. \"My God... my God...\"\\n\\n Moore turned toward her and pulled her up from the floor. He led her out of the farmhouse, keeping his grip tight on the butcher knife because he knew there could be more of them lurking very near. They quickly crossed the porch to his truck, and he told her to get in and lock the door behind her.\\n\\n As he climbed behind the wheel, Moore heard a crashing noise coming through the foliage perhaps twenty yards behind him; he twisted around, hearing Jana cry out, and saw the shadows approaching from the deeper jungle, the dark things plowing through the tangle of brush and vines. Moore turned the key in the ignition; the engine started, and he pressed his foot to the floor. The truck roared in response, its tires throwing up clumps of wet earth as Moore raced away up the road. In the side mirror, he saw them break through the jungle fringe, and then he was across the airstrip and heading back for Coquina village, his hands holding the wheel so tightly his knuckles were white as bone.\\n\\n \"WHAT WERE THEY?\" Jana clutched at his sleeve, her eyes wild and confused; the fear had her now, and she was unable to think.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re alive,\" he said, his eyes darting left and right to pierce the green shadows on each side of the twisted road; the reality of what he was saying numbed him, and his temples were bathed in a cold sweat. \"I saw them in the U-boat, and Kip saw them. I didn\u0027t believe... I didn\u0027t want to believe...\" He touched the red marks at his throat. \"I don\u0027t know why or how, but I know they\u0027re alive...\"\\n\\n He reached the village, speeding along the deserted streets; he saw the jeep was gone from its space in front of Kip\u0027s office, but he hammered on the door repeatedly in the vain hope that Kip might be there. As he turned away from the door he looked up and saw the thick roil of clouds in the sky, dull gray, blinding white, traces of black far in the distance. He crossed the Square, finding the grocery locked and the blinds down over the windows; he reached the hardware store and knocked on the front door there, but the place was deserted. He looked down High Street from store to store; everything was locked up and quiet, the streets empty, a ghost town. A white circle of gulls swirled above Kiss Bottom, their screams coming to him on currents of wind; they swept down across the surface and then back again toward the sky. Moore watched them flying in formation out to sea, as if abandoning Coquina.\\n\\n When he returned to the truck he couldn\u0027t look in Jana\u0027s eyes because of what he would see in them, and because he was afraid of what she might see in his. He started the engine, put the truck into gear, and drove on through the Square, climbing High Street.\\n\\n And at the hotel he saw the front door was open.\\n\\n He tensed involuntarily. Though he\u0027d left the door unlocked, he remembered closing it that morning. Moore slid the butcher knife into his waistband, his nerves raw.\\n\\n \"Wait here,\" he said to Jana. \"I\u0027m going in first.\" He left her sitting in the truck and walked cautiously up onto the porch; with one hand he drew out the knife, and with the other pulled open the screen door. He stepped across the threshold, his senses as aware as those of an animal; abruptly, he froze in place, trying to see into the dim room.\\n\\n There was a man sitting in a chair; a suitcase sat on the floor beside him. He held the glass paperweight in his hands, his eyes focused on it as if he had found something that had been lost for a very long time. Moore let the screen door bang shut behind him, and the man hastily - and awkwardly - rose to his feet. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-boat/page-19.html","bookId":2475,"book":{"id":2475,"title":"The Night Boat","description":"Storyline: A German submarine is sunk during World War Two.
