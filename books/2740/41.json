But that awareness wouldn’t keep me from taking her if she showed up at my door. I’m not as noble as she thinks I am. “Goodbye, Emma.”\n “Goodbye, Reid.”\n “So?” John answers when I ring his cell.\n “Not happening. And I don’t want to talk about it.” It’s not even 5:00 p.m. and I’ve just downed a Jack and Coke. Maybe there’s a luxury rehab place with a mother-son option. But rehab would never work; I’d have to actually quit drinking while I was there.\n “That’s cool, man. No problemo. What about the Porsche? You still trading up?”\n “Definitely. Soon as possible.” Dad already cashed out one of my investments; the money is sitting in my account. All I have to do is choose a car.\n “Rest up, bro. We’re going out tonight. Time to get you back to your pointless, pleasure-driven life.” That sums it up. Back to the clubs, the parties, the hookups. New car. New project to train for this summer and film next fall.\n “Is that all it is—a pointless, pleasure-driven life?”\n He sighs. “Shit, Reid. I don’t know. If you’re lucky. It’s either that or aspire to be some Dark Lord asshole like my father, with a boring-as-shit trophy wife like Elise, who has nothing to do but work out, get plastic surgery and have sex with my dad. I’d fucking kill myself if I was her.”\n My parents: Dad works, Mom drinks. Besides that, what? I think I’m nothing like them—as though my career and celebrity will make my existence more significant, but that’s bullshit and I know it. “Guess I’m feeling introspective.”\n John makes a sound of dismissal. “Dude, forget that shit. Talk about pointless.”\n I’m not sure what it will take to forget Emma Pierce’s belief that there’s more to me.\n Maybe I don’t want to forget. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/where-you-are-between-the-lines-2/page-41.html","bookId":2740,"book":{"id":2740,"title":"Where You Are (Between the Lines #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Where You Are (Between the Lines #2) \n Graham Douglas doesn’t do romantic relationships, but he was knocked for a loop when he met Emma Pierce on the set of his last film. As they grew closer, he did everything in his power to keep from falling for a girl being pursued by superstar Reid Alexander. Now home in New York, his life is once again under control, until Emma appears and shows him how not over her he is. \n Emma Pierce is forsaking an up-and-coming Hollywood career to embark on a life she’s only dreamed of—the life of a regular girl. After spending months burying her feelings for the two night-and-day guys who vied for her heart while filming her last movie, a twist of fate puts her in a coffee shop in the middle of Manhattan with the one she still misses. \n Brooke Cameron was a fresh-faced Texas girl when she arrived in LA. Now she’s a beach sitcom star turned conceited heiress on the big screen. Having just survived three months on location with her ex—Hollywood’s reigning golden boy—she’s older and wiser and has set her sights on her close friend Graham. The only thing standing in her way is the girl he can’t forget. \n Reid Alexander can sum up his life in one word: boring. Between film projects, there’s little going on outside of interviews, photo shoots, and the premiere of the film he finished last fall. The next-to-last thing he expects is to get a second chance with Emma, the girl who rejected him. The last thing he expects is for his still-bitter-ex to be the one to offer it to him on a platter.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/where-you-are-between-the-lines-2.jpg","author":"Tammara Webber","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/where-you-are-between-the-lines-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:13 PM"}}
