{"id":8253,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"This, Maximus, is what they throw in my teeth, as though it were the work of an infamous rake: verses about garlands and serenades. You must have noticed also that in this connexion they further attack me for calling these boys Charinus and Critias, which are not their true names. On this principle they may as well accuse Caius Catullus for calling Clodia Lesbia, Ticidas for substituting the name Perilla for that of Metella, Propertius for concealing the name Hostia beneath the pseudonym of Cynthia, and Tibullus for singing of Delia in his verse, when it was Plania who ruled his heart. For my part I should rather blame Caius Lucilius, even allowing him all the license of a satiric poet, for prostituting to the public gaze the boys Gentius and Macedo, whose real names he mentions in his verse without any attempt at concealment. How much more reserved is Mantua’s poet, who, when like myself he praised the slave-boy of his friend Pollio in one of his light pastoral poems, shrinks from mentioning real nnames and calls himself Corydon and the boy Alexis. But Aemilianus, whose rusticity far surpasses that of the Virgilean shepherds and cowherds, who is, in fact, and always has been a boor and a barbarian, though he thinks himself far more austere than Serranus, Curius, or Fabricius, those heroes of the days of old, denies that such verses are worthy of a philosopher who is a follower of Plato. Will you persist in this attitude, Aemilianus, if I can show that my verses were modelled upon Plato? For the only verses of Plato now extant are love-elegies, the reason, I imagine, being that he burned all his other poems because they were inferior in charm and finish. Learn then the verses written by Plato in honour of the boy Aster, though I doubt if at your age it is possible for you to become a man of learning. Thou wert the morning star among the living ere thy fair light had fled; — now having died, thou art as Hesperus giving new light unto the dead. There is another poem by Plato dealing conjointly with the boys Alexis and Phaedrus: I lid but breathe the words ‘Alexis fair’, and all men gazed on him with wondering eyes, my soul, why point to questing beasts their prize? ’Twas thus we lost our Phaedrus; ah! Beware! Without citing any further examples I will conclude by quoting a line addressed by Plato to Dion of Syracuse: Dion, with love thou hast distraught my soul.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/638/1063.html","bookId":274,"book":{"id":274,"title":"The Defense","description":"简介： Dynamite defense attorney Joseph Antonelli has never lost a case--or felt the sting of conscience for letting the guilty go free.
