{"id":8252,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"But enough of this! I now come to certain other of my verses, which according to them are amatory; but so vilely and coarsely did they read them as to leave no impression save one of disgust. Now what has it to do with the malpractices of the black art, if I write poems in praise of the boys of my friend Scribonius Laetus? Does the mere fact of my being a poet make me a wizard? Who ever heard any orator produce such likely ground for suspicion, such apt conjectures, such close-reasoned argument? ‘Apuleius has written verses!’ If they are bad, that is something against him as a poet, but not as a philosopher. If they are good, why do you accuse him? ‘But they were frivolous verses of an erotic character.’ So that is the charge you bring against me? and it was a mere slip of the tongue when you indicted me for practising the black art? And yet many others have written such verse, although you may be ignorant of the fact. Among the Greeks, for instance, there was a certain Teian, there was a Lacedaemonian, a Cean, and countless others; there was even a woman, a Lesbian, who wrote with such grace and such passion that the sweetness of her song makes us forgive the impropriety of her words; among our own poets there were Aedituus, Porcius, and Catulus, with countless others. ‘But they were not philosophers.’ Will you then deny that Solon was a serious man and a philosopher? Yet he is the author of that most wanton verse: Longing for your thighs and your sweet mouth. What is there so lascivious in all my verses compared with that one line? I will say nothing of the writings of Diogenes the Cynic, of Zeno the founder of Stoicism, and many other similar instances. Let me recite my own verses afresh, that my opponents may realize that I am not ashamed of them: Critias my treasure is and you, light of my life, Charinus, too hold in my love-tormented heart your own inalienable part. Ah! Doubt not! With redoubled spite though fire on fire consume me quite, the flames ye kindle, boys divine, I can endure, so ye be mine. Only to each may I be dear as your own selves are, and as near; grant only this and you shall be dear as mine own two eyes to be. Now let me read you the others also which they read last as being the most intemperate in expression. I lay these garlands, Critias sweet, and this my song before thy feet; song to thyself I dedicate, wreaths to the Angel of thy fate. The song I send to hymn the praise of this, the best of all glad days, whereon the circling seasons bring the glory of thy fourteenth spring; the garlands, that thy brows may shine with splendour worthy spring’s and thine, that thou in boyhood’s golden hours mayst deck the flower of life with flowers. Wherefore for these bright blooms of spring thy springtide sweet surrendering, the tribute of my love repay and all my gifts with thine outweigh. Surpass the twined garland’s grace with arms entwined in soft embrace; the crimson of the rose eclipse with kisses from thy rosy lips. Or if thou wilt, be this my meed and breathe thy soul into the reed; \\u00a1! then shall my songs be shamed and mute before the music of thy flute.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/638/1062.html","bookId":274,"book":{"id":274,"title":"The Defense","description":"简介： Dynamite defense attorney Joseph Antonelli has never lost a case--or felt the sting of conscience for letting the guilty go free.
