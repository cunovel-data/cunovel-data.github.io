The second cause of disease lies in the vitiation of those components of the body which, though formed out of the simple elements, have coalesced in such a manner as to have a specific character of their own, such as blood, entrails, bone, marrow, and the various substances made from the blending of each of these. Thirdly, the concretion in the body of various juices, turbid vapours, and dense humours is the last provocative of sickness.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/638/1102.html","bookId":274,"book":{"id":274,"title":"The Defense","description":"简介： Dynamite defense attorney Joseph Antonelli has never lost a case--or felt the sting of conscience for letting the guilty go free.
