{"id":43529,"no":8,"title":"8 SLAY IT WITH FLOWERS","content":"IT WAS three o\u0027clock in the morning. The noise of the traffic to Yokohama had died. James Bond didn\u0027t feel tired. He was now totally absorbed in this extraordinary story of the Swiss doctor, who, as Tiger had originally said, \u0027collected death\u0027. \n Tiger wasn\u0027t telling him this bizarre case history for his entertainment. There was going to come a moment of climax. What would that climax be? \n Tiger wiped his hand over his face. He said, \u0027Did you read a story in the evening edition of the Asahi today? It concerned a suicide.\u0027 \n \u0027No.\u0027 \n \u0027This was a young student aged eighteen who had failed his examination for the university for the second time. He lived in the suburbs of Tokyo. There was construction work on a new department, a department store, going on near where he lived. He went out of his room on to the site. A pile-driver was at work, sinking the foundations. Suddenly this youth broke through the surrounding workmen and, as the pile came crashing down, laid his head on the block beneath it.\u0027 \n \u0027What a ghastly business! Why?\u0027 \n \u0027He had brought dishonour on his parents, his ancestors. This was his way of expiation. Suicide is a most, unfortunate aspect of the Japanese way of life.\u0027 Tiger paused. \u0027Or perhaps a most noble one. It depends how you look at it. That boy, and his family, will have gained great face in his neighbourhood.\u0027 \n \u0027You can\u0027t gain face from strawberry jam.\u0027 \n \u0027Think again, Bondo-san. Your posthumous VCs, for instance?\u0027 \n \u0027They\u0027re not awarded for committing suicide after failing in an examination.\u0027 \n \u0027We are not so demokorasu as you are.\u0027 There was irony in Tiger\u0027s voice. \u0027Dishonour must be expunged - according to those of us who remain what you would describe as old-fashioned. There is no apology more sincere than the offering up of your own life. It is literally all you have to give.\u0027 \n \u0027But even if this boy failed for the university, he could have gone for a lower standard of examination, for a lower grade of college. As you know, we say \"Blast!\" or perhaps a stronger word if we fail an examination in Britain. But we readjust our sights, or our parents do it for us, and have another bash. We don\u0027t kill ourselves. It wouldn\u0027t occur to us. It would be dishonourable rather than honourable. It would be cowardly - a refusal to stand up to reverses, to life. And it would give great pain to our parents, and certainly no satisfaction to our ancestors.\u0027 \n \u0027With us it is different. And despite demokorasu, the parents of this youth will be rejoicing this evening and their neighbours will be rejoicing with them. Honour is more important to us than life - more proud, more beautiful.\u0027 \n Bond shrugged. \u0027Well, I just think that if the boy had the guts to do this thing, it was the waste of a perfectly good Japanese life. In fact, of course, this suicide business in Japan is nothing more than a form of hysteria-an expression of the streak of violence that seems to run all through the history of Japan. If you hold your own life so cheaply, it follows that you will hold others\u0027 lives even more cheaply. The other day, I saw a traffic accident at one of the main crossings. I don\u0027t know the name of it. It was a multiple affair, and there were bodies all over the place. The police came, but instead of concentrating on getting the wounded to hospital, insisted that they should lie where they were so that they could draw chalk lines round them and photograph them - presumably for use when the case came to court.\u0027 \n \u0027That is common practice,\u0027 said Tiger indifferently. \u0027We are much over-populated. Abortion is legal. It is helping to solve one of our problems if a few extra people die in an automobile accident. But there is something in what you said earlier. Our word for suicide is jisatsu, literally \"self-murder\", and although it is a violent solution to a personal problem, it carries no stigma as it would in your country. In fact, one of our most famous folk-tales, known to all children, is of the forty-seven ronin, or bodyguards. Through their negligence, their lord, Asano, was assassinated. They swore to avenge him and they did so. But then they came together at a place called Ako and all committed seppuku to expiate their negligence. This is what you know as hara-kiri, which is a vulgar term meaning \"belly-cutting\". Today, at the time of the festival at the Ako shrine, special trains have to be laid on to accommodate the respectful pilgrims.\u0027 \n \u0027Well, if you bring your children up on that sort of stuff, you can\u0027t expect them not to venerate the act of suicide.\u0027 \n \u0027Just so,\u0027 said Tiger proudly, \u002725,000 Japanese commit suicide every year. Only the bureaucrats regard that as a shameful statistic. And the more spectacular the suicide, the more warmly it is approved. Not long ago, a young student achieved great renown by trying to saw his own head off. Lovers link hands and throw themselves over the very high Kegon Falls at Nikko. The Mihara volcano on the island of Oshima is another favourite locale. People run down the roasting slope of the crater and hurl themselves., their shoes on fire, into the bubbling cauldron in its centre. To combat this popular pastime, the interfering authorities have now opened, at great expense, a \"Suicide Prevention Office\" on the peak. But always the wheels of the good old-fashioned railway train provide the most convenient guillotine. They have the merit of being self-operating. All you need to do is make a four-foot jump.\u0027 \n \u0027You\u0027re a bloodthirsty old bastard, Tiger. But what\u0027s all this lecture about anyway? What\u0027s it got to do with friend Shatterhand and his pretty garden?\u0027 \n \u0027Everything, Bondo-san. Everything. You see, much against the good doctor\u0027s wishes of course, his poison garden has become the most desirable site for suicides in the whole of Japan. It has everything - a ride on our famous \"Romance\" express to Kyoto; a boat trip across our beautiful Inland Sea that is so full of Japanese history; a local train from the terminal harbour at Beppu to Fukuoka and a walk or taxi drive along a beautiful coast to the awe-inspiring ramparts of this mysterious Castle of Death. Climb these, or smuggle yourself in on a provision cart, and then a last delicious, ruminative walk, perhaps hand-in-hand with your lover, through the beautiful groves. And finally the great gamble, the game of pachinko the Japanese love so much. Which ball will have your number on it? Will your death be easy or painful? Will a Russell\u0027s Viper strike at your legs as you walk the silent, well-raked paths? Will some kindly, deadly dew fall upon you during the night as you rest under this or that gorgeous tree? Or will hunger or curiosity lead you to munch a handful of those red berries or pick one of those orange fruit? Of course, if you want to make it quick, there is always a bubbling, sulphurous fumarole at hand. In any one of those, the thousand degrees Centigrade will allow you just enough time for one scream. The place is nothing more than a departmento of death, its shelves laden with delicious packages of self-destruction, all given away for nothing. Can you not imagine that old and young flock there as if to a shrine? The police have erected a barricade across the road. Genuine visitors, botanists and so on, have to show a pass. But the suicides fight their way to the shrine across the fields and marshes, scrabble at the great walls, break their nails to gain entrance. The good doctor is of course much dismayed. He has erected stern notices of warning, with skulls and crossbones upon them. They act only as advertisements! He has even gone to the expense of flying one of those high helium balloons from the roof of his castle. The hanging streamers threaten trespassers with prosecution. But, alas for the doctor\u0027s precautions, the high balloon serves only to beckon. Here is death! it proclaims. Come and get it!\u0027 \n \u0027You\u0027re daft, Tiger. Why don\u0027t you arrest him? Burn the place down?\u0027 \n \u0027Arrest him for what? For presenting Japan with this unique collection of rare plants? Burn down a million-pound establishment belonging to a respected galjin resident? The man has done nothing wrong. If anyone is to blame, it is the Japanese people. It is true that he could exercise more careful surveillance, have his grounds more regularly patrolled. And it is certainly odd that when he has the ambulance called, the . victims are always totally dead and are usually in the form of a bag of calcined bones fished out of one of the fumaroles. From the list I have shown you, one would have expected some to be only crippled, or blinded. The Herr Doktor expresses himself as much puzzled. He suggests that, in the cases of blindness or amnesia, the victims presumably fall into one of the fumaroles by mistake. Maybe. But, as I have said, his tally so far is over five hundred and, with the stream of publicity, more and more people will be attracted to the Castle of Death. We have got to put a stop to it.\u0027 \n \u0027What steps have been taken so far?\u0027 \n \u0027Commissions of investigation have visited the doctor. They have been most courteously treated. The doctor has begged that something shall be done to protect him from these trespassers. He complains that they interfere with his work, break off precious boughs and pick valuable plants. He shows himself as entirely cooperative with any measures that can be suggested short of abandoning this project, which is so dear to his heart and so much appreciated by trie Japanese specialists in botany and so forth. He has made a further most generous offer. He is constructing a research department - to be manned by workers of his own choice, mark you -to extract the poisons from his shrubs and plants and give the essences free to an appropriate medical research centre. You will have noted that many of these poisons are valuable medicines in a diluted form.\u0027 \n \u0027But how has all this come on your plate?\u0027 Bond was now getting drowsy. It was four o\u0027clock and the horizon of jagged grey, porcelain-shingled roof-tops was lightening. He poured down the last of the sake. It had the flat taste of too much. It was time he was in bed. But Tiger was obviously obsessed with this lunatic business, and subtle, authentic glimpses of Japan were coming through the ridiculous, nightmare story with its undertones of Poe, Le Fanu, Bram Stoker, Ambrose Bierce. \n Tiger seemed unaffected by the lateness of the hour. The samurai face was perhaps etched in more sinister, more brutal lines. The hint of Tartar, tamed and civilized, lurked with less concealment, like a caged animal, in the dark pools of his eyes. But the occasional rocking motion on the buttocks and sides of the feet was the only sign that he was interested, even excited. He said, \u0027One month ago, Bondo-san, I sent one of my best men into this place to try and discover what it was all about. I was so instructed by my Minister, the Minister of the Interior. He in turn was under orders from the Prime Minister. The matter was becoming one of public debate. I chose a good man. He was instructed to get into the place, observe, and report. One week later, Bondo-san, he was recovered from the sea on a beach near this Castle of Death. He was blinded and in delirium. All the lower half of his body was terribly burned. He could only babble a haiku about dragonflies. I later discovered that, as a youth, he had indulged in the pastime of our youngsters. He had tied a female dragonfly on a thread and let it go. This acts as a lure for the male dragonfly and you can quickly catch many males in this way. They attach themselves to the female and will not let go. The haiku - that is a verse of seventeen syllables - he kept on reciting until his death, which came soon, was \"Desolation! Pink dragonflies flitting above the graves.\"\u0027 \n James Bond felt he was living inside a dream: the little room, partitioned in imitation rice-paper and cedar plywood, the open vista of a small, inscrutable garden in which water tinkled, the distant redness of an imminent dawn, the long background of sake and cigarettes, the quiet voice of the storyteller telling a fairy tale, as it might be told in a tent under the stars. And yet this was something that had happened the other day, close by - was happening now, something that Tiger had brought him here to tell. Why? Because he was lonely? Because there was no one else he could trust? Bond pulled himself out of his somnolent slouch. He said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Tiger. What did you do next?\u0027 \n Tiger Tanaka seemed to sit slightly more upright on his black-edged rectangle of golden tatami. He looked very directly at James Bond and said, \u0027What was there to do? I did nothing except apologize to my superiors. I waited for an honourable solution to present itself. I waited for you to come.\u0027 \n \u0027Me!\u0027 \n \u0027You were sent. It might have been another.\u0027 \n James Bond yawned. He couldn\u0027t help it. He could see no end to the evening. Tiger had got some Japanese bee in his Japanese bonnet. How in hell could Bond stop it buzzing? He said, \u0027Tiger. It\u0027s time for bed. Let\u0027s talk about the rest of this tomorrow. Of course I\u0027ll give you any advice I can. I can see it\u0027s a difficult problem. But those are just the ones to sleep on.\u0027 He made to rise from his chair. \n Tiger said, and it was an order, \u0027Sit down, Bondo-san. If you have any regard for your country, you leave tomorrow.\u0027 He consulted his watch. \u0027By the twelve-twenty from Tokyo main station. Your ultimate destination is Fukuoka on the southern island of Kyushu. You will not be going back to your hotel. You will not be seeing Dikko. From now on you are under my personal orders.\u0027 The voice went very quiet and velvety. \u0027Is that understood?\u0027 \n Bond sat up as if he had been stung. \u0027What in God\u0027s name are you talking about, Tiger?\u0027 \n Tiger Tanaka said, \u0027In my office the other day you made a significant statement. You said words to the effect that in exchange for MAGIC 44 you were empowered to carry out any personal services that I might require of you.\u0027 \n \u0027I didn\u0027t say that I was empowered. I meant that I would do anything for you on my personal responsibility.\u0027 \n \u0027That is quite good enough. I took you at your word and I requested an audience of the Prime Minister. He instructed me to proceed, but to regard the matter as a State secret known only to him and to me-and of course to you.\u0027 \n \u0027Come on, Tiger,\u0027 said Bond impatiently. \u0027Cut the cackle. What is it you want me to do?\u0027 \n But Tiger was not to be hurried. He said, \u0027Bondo-san, I will now be blunt with you, and you will not be offended, because we are friends. Yes? Now it is a sad fact that I, and many of us in positions of authority in Japan, have formed an unsatisfactory opinion about the British people since the war. You have not only lost a great Empire, you have seemed almost anxious to throw it away with both hands. All right,\u0027 he held up a hand, \u0027we will not go deeply into the reasons for this policy, but when you apparently sought to arrest this slide into impotence at Suez, you succeeded only in stage-managing one of the most pitiful bungles in the history of the world, if not the worst. Further, your governments have shown themselves successively incapable of ruling and have handed over effective control of the country to the trade unions, who appear to be dedicated to the principle of doing less and less work for more money. This feather-bedding, this shirking of an honest day\u0027s work, is sapping at ever-increasing speed the moral fibre of the British, a quality the world once so much admired. In its place we now see a vacuous, aimless horde of seekers-after-pleasure - gambling at the pools and bingo, whining at the weather and the declining fortunes of the country, and wallowing nostalgically in gossip about the doings of the Royal Family and of your so-called aristocracy in the pages of the most debased newspapers in the world.\u0027 \n James Bond roared with laughter. \u0027You\u0027ve got a bloody cheek, Tiger! You ought to write that out and sign it \"Octogenarian\" and send it in to The Times. You just come over and take a look at the place. It\u0027s not doing all that badly.\u0027 \n \u0027Bondo-san, you have pleaded guilty out of your own mouth. \"Not doing too badly,\" indeed! That is the crybaby excuse of a boy who gets a thoroughly bad end-of-term report. In fact you are doing very badly indeed in the opinion of your few remaining friends. And now you come to me and ask for some very important intelligence material to bolster up the pitiful ruins of a once great Power. Why should we give it to you? What good will it do us? What good will it do you, Bondo-san? It is like giving smelling salts to a punch-drunk heavy-weight just before the inevitable knockout.\u0027 \n Bond said angrily, \u0027Balls to you, Tiger! And balls again! Just because you\u0027re a pack of militant potential murderers here, longing to get rid of your American masters and play at being samurai again, snarling behind your subservient smiles, you only judge people by your own jungle standards. Let me tell you this, my fine friend. England may have been bled pretty thin by a couple of World Wars, our Welfare State politics may have made us expect too much for free, and the liberation of our Colonies may have gone too fast, but we still climb Everest and beat plenty of the world at plenty of sports and win Nobel Prizes. Our politicians may be a feather pated bunch, and I expect yours are too. All politicians are. But there\u0027s nothing wrong with the British people - although there are only fifty million of them.\u0027 \n Tiger Tanaka smiled happily. \u0027Well spoken, Bondo-san. I thought your famous English stoicism might break down if I hit hard enough. I just wanted to see. And, for your information, those are very similar to the words I addressed to my Prime Minister. And do you know what he said? He said, all right, Mr Tanaka. Put this Commander Bond to the test. If he succeeds, I will agree that there is still an elite in Britain and that this valuable material would be safe in their hands. If he fails, you will politely turn down the request.\u0027 \n Bond shrugged impatiently. He was still smarting under Tiger\u0027s onslaught, and the half-truths which he knew lay behind his words. \u0027All right, Tiger. What is this ridiculous test? Some typical bit of samurai nonsense, I suppose.\u0027 \n \u0027More or less,\u0027 agreed Tiger Tanaka, with equanimity. \u0027You are to enter this Castle of Death and slay the Dragon within.\u0027 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584/47090.html","bookId":1266,"book":{"id":1266,"title":"007之雷霆谷 You Only Live Twice","description":"简介： 一天，美国太空船遭到了不明飞行物的攻击，美方怀疑是苏联的阴谋，目的是想独霸太空。美方测出了不明飞行物的降落地点是在日本，于是英国军方派出007（肖恩康纳利SeanConnery饰）前往日本替美方调查此事。由于007的身份特殊，直接进入日本容易被敌人察觉。为了掩人耳目...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/21/09-23-13-33-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
