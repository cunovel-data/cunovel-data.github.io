{"id":43525,"no":4,"title":"4 DIKKO ON THE GINZA","content":"THE huge right fist crashed into the left palm with the noise of a .45 pistol shot. The great square face of the Australian turned almost purple and the veins stood out on the grizzled temples. With controlled violence, but almost under his breath, he intoned savagely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I bludge, \\n\\n Thou bludgest, \\n\\n He bludges, \\n\\n We bludge, \\n\\n You bludge, \\n\\n They all bludge.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He reached under the low table and then seemed to think better of it and moved his hand to the glass of sake, picked it up and poured it down his throat without a swallow. \\n\\n Bond said mildly, \u0027Take it easy, Dikko. What\u0027s bitten you? And what does this vulgar-sounding colonial expression mean?\u0027 \\n\\n Richard Lovelace Henderson, of Her Majesty\u0027s Australian Diplomatic Corps, looked belligerently round the small crowded bar in a by-street off the Ginza and said out of the corner of his large and usually cheerful mouth that was now turned down in bitterness and anger, \u0027You stupid pommy bastard, we\u0027ve been miked! That bludger Tanaka\u0027s miked us! Here, under the table! See the little wire down the leg? And see that wingy over at the bar? Chap with one arm looking bloody respectable in his blue suit and black tie? That\u0027s one of Tiger\u0027s men. I can smell \u0027em by now. They\u0027ve been tailing me off and on for ten years. Tiger dresses \u0027em all like little CIA gentlemen. You watch out for any Jap who\u0027s drinking Western and wearing that rig. All Tiger\u0027s men.\u0027 He grumbled, \u0027Damn good mind to go over and call the bastard.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond said, \u0027Well, if we\u0027re being miked, all this\u0027ll make sweet reading for Mr Tanaka tomorrow morning.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What the hell,\u0027 said Dikko Henderson resignedly. \u0027The old bastard knows what I think of him. Now he\u0027ll just have it in writing. Teach him to stop leaning on me. And my friends,\u0027 he added, with a blistering glance at Bond. \u0027It\u0027s really you he wants to size up. And I don\u0027t mind if he hears me saying so. Bludger? Well, hear me now, Tiger! This is the great Australian insult. You can use it anyways.\u0027 He raised his voice. \u0027But in general it means a worthless pervert, ponce, scoundrel, liar, traitor and rogue - with no redeeming feature. And I hope your stewed seaweed sticks in your gullet at breakfast tomorrow when you know what I think of you.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond laughed. The torrent of powerful swear-words had started its ceaseless flow the day before at the airport - Haneda, \u0027the field of wings\u0027. It had taken Bond nearly an hour to extract his single suitcase from the customs area, and he had emerged fuming into the central hall only to be jostled and pushed aside by an excited crowd of young Japanese bearing paper banners that said \u0027International Laundry Convention\u0027. Bond was exhausted from his flight. He let out one single four-letter expletive. \\n\\n Behind him a big voice repeated the same word and added some more. \u0027That\u0027s my boy! That\u0027s the right way to greet the East! You\u0027ll be needing all those words and more before you\u0027re through with the area.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond had turned. The huge man in the rumpled grey suit thrust out a hand as big as a small ham. \u0027Glad to meet you. I\u0027m Henderson. As you were the only pommy on the plane, I guess you\u0027re Bond. Here. Give me that bag. Got a car outside and the sooner we get away from this blankety blank madhouse the better.\u0027 \\n\\n Henderson looked like a middle-aged prize fighter who has retired and taken to the bottle. His thin suit bulged with muscle round the arms and shoulders and with fat round the waist. He had a craggy, sympathetic face, rather stony blue eyes, and a badly broken nose. He was sweating freely (Bond was to find that he was always sweating), and as he barged his way through the crowd, using Bond\u0027s suitcase as a battering ram, he extracted a rumpled square of terry cloth from his trouser-pocket and wiped it round his neck and face. The crowd parted unresentfully to let the giant through, and Bond followed in his wake to a smart Toyopet saloon waiting in a no-parking area. The chauffeur got out and bowed. Henderson fired a torrent of instructions at him in fluent Japanese and followed Bond into the back seat, settling himself with a grunt. \u0027Taking you to your hotel first - the Okura, latest of the \\n\\n Western ones. American tourist got murdered at the Royal Oriental the other day and we don\u0027t want to lose you all that soon. Then we\u0027ll do a bit of serious drinking. Had some dinner?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027About six of them, as far as I can remember. J AL certainly takes good care of your stomach.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why did you choose the willow-pattern route? How was the old ruptured duck?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027They told me the bird was a crane. Very dainty. But efficient. Thought I might as well practise being inscrutable before plunging into all this.\u0027 Bond waved at the cluttered shambles of the Tokyo suburbs through which they were tearing at what seemed to Bond a suicidal speed. \u0027Doesn\u0027t look the most attractive city in the world. And why are we driving on the left?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027God knows,\u0027 said Henderson moodily. \u0027The bloody Japs do everything the wrong way round. Read the old instruction books wrong, I daresay. Light switches go up instead of down. Taps turn to the left. Door handles likewise. Why, they even race their horses clockwise instead of anti-clockwise like civilized people. As for Tokyo, it\u0027s bloody awful. It\u0027s either too hot or too cold or pouring with rain. And there\u0027s an earthquake about every day. But don\u0027t worry about them. They just make you feel slightly drunk. The typhoons are worse. If one starts to blow, go into the stoutest bar you can see and get drunk. But the first ten years are the worst. It\u0027s got its point when you know your way around. Bloody expensive if you live Western, but I stick to the back alleys and do all right. Really quite exhilarating. Got to know the lingo though, and when to bow and take off your shoes and so on. You\u0027ll have to get the basic routines straight pretty quickly if you\u0027re going to make any headway with the people you\u0027ve come to see. Underneath the stiff collars and striped pants in the government departments, there\u0027s still plenty of the old samurai tucked away. I laugh at them for it, and they laugh back because they\u0027ve got to know my line of patter. But that doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t bow from the waist when I know it\u0027s expected of me and when I want something. You\u0027ll get the hang of it all right.\u0027 \\n\\n Henderson fired some Japanese at the driver who had been glancing frequently in his driving mirror. The driver laughed and replied cheerfully. \u0027Thought so,\u0027 said Henderson. \u0027We\u0027ve got ourselves a tail. Typical of old Tiger. I told him you were staying at the Okura, but he wants to make sure for himself. Don\u0027t worry. It\u0027s just part of his crafty ways. If you find one of his men breathing down your neck in bed tonight, or a girl if you\u0027re lucky, just talk to them politely and they\u0027ll bow and hiss themselves out.\u0027 \\n\\n But a solitary sleep had followed the serious drinking in the Bamboo Bar of the Okura, and the next day had been spent doing the sights and getting some cards printed that described Bond as Second Secretary in the Cultural Department of the Australian Embassy. \u0027They know that\u0027s our intelligence side,\u0027 said Henderson, \u0027and they know I\u0027m the head of it and you\u0027re my temporary assistant, so why not spell it out for them?\u0027 And that evening they had gone for more serious drinking to Henderson\u0027s favourite bar, Melody\u0027s, off the Ginza, where everybody called Henderson \u0027Dikko\u0027 or \u0027Dikko-san\u0027, and where they were ushered respectfully to the quiet corner table that appeared to be his Stammtisch. \\n\\n And now Henderson reached under the table and, with a powerful wrench, pulled out the wires and left them hanging. \u0027I\u0027ll give that black bastard Melody hell for this when I get around to it,\u0027 he said belligerently. \u0027And to think of all I\u0027ve done for the dingo bastard! Used to be a favourite pub of the English Colony and the Press Club layabouts. Had a good restaurant attached to it. That\u0027s gone now. The Eyteye cook trod on the cat and spilled the soup and he picked up the cat and threw it into the cooking stove. Of course that got around pretty quick, and all the animal-lovers and sanctimonious bastards got together and tried to have Melody\u0027s licence taken away. I managed to put in squeeze in the right quarter and saved him, but everyone quit his restaurant and he had to close it. I\u0027m the only regular who\u0027s stuck to him. And now he goes and does this to me! Oh well, he\u0027ll have had the squeeze put on him, I suppose. Anyway, that\u0027s the end of the tape so far as T.T.\u0027s concerned. I\u0027ll give him hell too. He ought to have learned by now that me and my friends don\u0027t want to assassinate the Emperor or blow up the Diet or something.\u0027 Dikko glared around him as if he proposed to do both those things. \u0027Now then, James, to business. I\u0027ve fixed up for you to meet Tiger tomorrow morning at eleven. I\u0027ll pick you up and take you there. \"The Bureau of All-Asian Folkways.\" I won\u0027t describe it to you. It\u0027d spoil it. Now, I don\u0027t really know what you\u0027re here for. Spate of top secret cables from Melbourne. To be deciphered by yours truly in person. Thanks very much! And my Ambassador, Jim Saunderson, good bloke, says he doesn\u0027t want to know anything about it. Thinks it\u0027d be even better if he didn\u0027t meet you at all. Okay with you? No offence, but he\u0027s a wise guy and likes to keep his hands clean. And I don\u0027t want to know anything about your job either. That way, you\u0027re the only one who gets the powdered bamboo in his coffee. But I gather you want to get some high-powered gen out of Tiger without the CIA knowing anything about it. Right? Well that\u0027s going to be a dicey business. Tiger\u0027s a career man with a career mind. Although, on the surface, he\u0027s a hundred per cent demokorasu, he\u0027s a deep one -very deep indeed. The American occupation and the American influence here look like a very solid basis for a total American-Japanese alliance. But once a Jap, always a Jap. It\u0027s the same with all the other great nations - Chinese, Russian, German, English. It\u0027s their bones that matter, not their lying faces. And all those races have got tremendous bones. Compared with the bones, the smiles or scowls don\u0027t mean a thing. And time means nothing for them either. Ten years is the blink of a star for the big ones. Get me? So Tiger, and his superiors, who, I suppose, are the Diet and, in the end, the Emperor, will look at your proposition principally from two angles. Is it immediately desirable, today? Or is it a long-term investment? Something that may pay off for the country in ten, twenty years. And, if I were you, I\u0027d stick to that spiel - the long-term talk. These people, people like Tiger, who\u0027s an absolutely top man in Japan, don\u0027t think in terms of days or months or years. They think in terms of centuries. Quite right, when you come to think of it.\u0027 \\n\\n Dikko Henderson made a wide gesture with his left hand. Bond decided that Dikko was getting cheerfully tight. He had found a Palomar pony to run with. They must be rare enough in Tokyo. They were both past the eighth flask of sake, but Dikko had also laid a foundation of Suntory whisky in the Okura while he\u0027d been waiting for Bond to write out an innocuous cable to Melbourne with the prefix \u0027Information-wise\u0027, which meant that it was for Mary Goodnight, to announce his arrival and give his current address. But it was all right with Bond that Dikko should be getting plastered. He would talk better and looser and, in the end, wiser that way. And Bond wanted to pick his brains. \\n\\n Bond said, \u0027But what sort of a chap is this Tanaka? Is he your enemy or your friend?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Both. More of a friend probably. At least I\u0027d guess so. I amuse him. His CIA pals don\u0027t. He loosens up with me. We\u0027ve got things in common. We share a pleasure in the delights of samsara - wine and women. He\u0027s a great cocks-man. I also have ambitions in that direction. I\u0027ve managed to keep him out of two marriages. Trouble with Tiger is he always wants to marry \u0027em. He\u0027s paying cock-tax, that\u0027s alimony in the Australian vernacular, to three already. So he\u0027s acquired an ON with regard to me. That\u0027s an obligation - almost as important in the Japanese way of life as \"face\". When you have an ON, you\u0027re not very, happy until you\u0027ve discharged it honourably, if you\u0027ll pardon the bad pun. And if a man makes you a present of a salmon, you mustn\u0027t repay him with a shrimp. It\u0027s got to be with an equally larg? salmon - larger if possible, so that then you\u0027ve jumped the man, and now he has an ON with regard to you, and you\u0027re quids in morally, socially and spiritually - and the last one\u0027s the most important. Well now. Tiger\u0027s ON towards me is a very powerful one, very difficult to discharge. He\u0027s paid little slices of it off with various intelligence dope. He\u0027s paid off another big slice by accepting your presence here and giving you an interview so soon after your arrival. If you\u0027d been an ordinary supplicant, -it might have taken you weeks. He\u0027d have given you a fat dose of shikiri-naoshi - that\u0027s making you wait, giving you the great stone face. The sumo wrestlers use it in the ring to make an opponent look and feel small in front of the audience. Got it? So you start with that in your favour. He would be predisposed to do what you want because that would remove all his ON towards me and, by his accounting, stick a whole packet of ON on my back towards him. But it\u0027s not so simple as that. All Japanese have permanent ON towards their superiors, the Emperor, their ancestors and the Japanese gods. This they can only discharge by doing \"the right thing\". Not easy, you\u0027ll say. Because how can you know what the higher echelon thinks is the right thing? Well, you get out of that by doing what the bottom of the ladder thinks right - i.e. your immediate superiors. That passes the buck, psychologically, on to the , Emperor, and he\u0027s got to make his peace with ancestors and gods. But that\u0027s all right with him, because he embodies all the echelons above him, so he can get on with dissecting fish, which is his hobby, with a clear conscience. Got it? It\u0027s not really as mysterious as it sounds. Much the same routine as operates in big corporations, like ICI or Shell, or in the Services, except with them the ladder stops at the Board of Directors or the Chiefs of Staff. It\u0027s easier that way. You don\u0027t have to involve the Almighty and your great-grandfather in a decision to cut the price of aspirin by a penny a bottle.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t sound very demokorasu to me.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Of course it isn\u0027t, you dumb bastard. For God\u0027s sake, get it into your head that the Japanese are a separate human species. They\u0027ve only been operating as a civilized people, in the debased sense we talk about it in the West, for fifty, at the most a hundred years. Scratch a Russian and you\u0027ll find a Tartar. Scratch a Japanese and you\u0027ll find a samurai - or what he thinks is a samurai. Most of this samurai stuff is a myth, like the Wild West bunk the Americans are brought up on, or your knights in shining armour at King Arthur\u0027s court. Just because people play baseball and wear bowler hats doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re quote civilized unquote. Just to show you I\u0027m getting rather tight -not drunk, mark you-I\u0027d add that the UN are going to reap the father and mother of a whirlwind by quote liberating unquote the colonial peoples. Give \u0027em a thousand years, yes. \\n\\n But give \u0027em ten, no. You\u0027re only taking away their blowpipes and giving them machine guns. Just you wait for the first one to start crying to high heaven for nuclear fission. Because they must have quote parity unquote with the lousy colonial powers. I\u0027ll give you ten years for that to happen, my friend. And when it does, I\u0027ll dig myself a deep hole in the ground and sit in it.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond laughed. \u0027That also doesn\u0027t sound very demokorasu? \\n\\n \u0027 \"I fornicate upon thy demokorasu\" as brother Hemingway would have said. I stand for government by an elite.\u0027 Dikko Henderson downed his ninth pint of sake. \u0027And voting graded by each individual\u0027s rating in that elite. And one tenth of a vote for my government if you don\u0027t agree with me!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027For God\u0027s sake, Dikko! Plow in hell did we get on to politics? Let\u0027s go and get some food. I\u0027ll agree there\u0027s a certain aboriginal common sense in what you say…\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t talk to me about the aborigines! What in hell do you think you know about the aborigines? Do you know that in my country there\u0027s a move afoot, not afoot, at full gallop, to give the aborigines the vote? You pommy poofter. You give me any more of that liberal crap and I\u0027ll have your balls for a bow-tie.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond said mildly, \u0027What\u0027s a poofter?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What you\u0027d call a pansy. No,\u0027 Dikko Henderson got to his feet and fired a string of what sounded like lucid Japanese at the man behind the bar, \u0027before I condemn you utterly, we\u0027ll go and eat eels-place where you can get a serious bottle of plonk to match. Then we\u0027ll go to \"The House of Total Delight\". After that, I will give you my honest verdict, honestly come by.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond said, \u0027You\u0027re a no-good kangaroo bum, Dikko. But I like eels. As long as they\u0027re not jellied. I\u0027ll pay for them and for the later relaxation. You pay for the rice wine and the plonk, whatever that is. Take it easy. The wingy at the bar has an appraising look.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I come to appraise Mr Richard Lovelace Henderson, not to bury him.\u0027 Dikko Henderson produced a wad of thousand yen notes and began counting them out for the waiter. \u0027Not yet, that is.\u0027 He walked, with careful majesty, up to the bar and addressed himself to the large Negro in a plum-coloured coat behind it. \u0027Melody, be ashamed of yourself!\u0027 Then he led the way, with massive dignity, out of the bar. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584/47086.html","bookId":1266,"book":{"id":1266,"title":"007之雷霆谷 You Only Live Twice","description":"简介： 一天，美国太空船遭到了不明飞行物的攻击，美方怀疑是苏联的阴谋，目的是想独霸太空。美方测出了不明飞行物的降落地点是在日本，于是英国军方派出007（肖恩康纳利SeanConnery饰）前往日本替美方调查此事。由于007的身份特殊，直接进入日本容易被敌人察觉。为了掩人耳目...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/21/09-23-13-33-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
