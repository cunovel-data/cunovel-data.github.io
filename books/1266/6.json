{"id":43527,"no":6,"title":"6 TIGER, TIGER!","content":"AND now it was a month later and Mr Tanaka had become \u0027Tiger\u0027 and Commander Bond had become \u0027Bondo-san\u0027. Tiger had explained his name for James Bond. \u0027James,\u0027 he had said. \u0027That is a difficult work in Japanese. And it does not convey sufficient respect. Bond-san is too much like the Japanese word bonsan, which means a priest, a greybeard. The hard consonants at the end of \"Bond\" are also not easy for the Japanese, and when these occur in a foreign word we add an O. So you are Bondo-san. That is acceptable?\u0027 \u0027Does Bondo mean a pig or anything like that in Japanese?\u0027 \u0027No. It has no meaning.\u0027 \u0027Forgive my asking. The Japanese seem to enjoy many private jokes at the expense of the gaijin. I referred the other day to a friend of mine called \"Monkey\" McCall whom we used to call \"Munko\". You told me that this was an unmentionable word in your language. So I thought \"Bondo\" might be equally unmentionable.\u0027 \u0027Have no fear. It is totally respectable.\u0027 The weeks had passed without any significant progress in Bond\u0027s mission except in the direction of what seemed to be a genuine friendship between Bond, Tiger and Dikko. Outside working hours the three men became wellnigh inseparable, but Bond sensed that on their excursions into the countryside and during their roistering in the evenings he was being constantly, but with great discretion, sized up. Dikko had confirmed Bond\u0027s impression. \u0027I think you\u0027re making progress, champ. Tiger would regard it as dishonourable to lead you up the garden path and then pull the rug out from under you with a flat refusal. Something\u0027s definitely cooking in the background, but what it is I haven\u0027t the faintest idea. I guess the ball\u0027s with Tiger\u0027s superiors, but with Tiger on your side. And, in the vernacular, Tiger\u0027s got what\u0027s called \"a broad face\". That means he has great powers as a fixer. And this ON he\u0027s got in respect of Britain is a huge factor in your favour. What he gave you on your first meeting was an unheard-of presento, as we call it here. But watch out! You\u0027re piling up a great heap of ON in respect of Tiger. And if it comes to striking a bargain, I hope you\u0027ve got a pretty massive presento up your sleeve so that the ON on both sides is more or less evenly balanced. None of this salmon and shrimp business! Have got? Can do?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not so sure,\u0027 said Bond doubtfully. The Macao \u0027Blue Route\u0027 material had already dwindled in his mind to the size of a minnow in comparison with the salmon that was Tiger\u0027s to give or withhold. The impact of the single slice he had handed Bond had already been formidable. The test of the zoo-megaton bomb had duly taken place and had been greeted by the public uproar anticipated by Moscow. But counter-action by the West had been swift. On the excuse of protecting Soviet personnel in England from demonstrations of public animosity, they had been confined within a radius of twenty miles of their homes, and \u0027for their protection\u0027 police were thick round the Soviet Embassy, the consulates and their various trading offices. There had, of course, been reprisals on British diplomats and journalists in Russia, but these were to have been expected. Then President Kennedy had come out with the strongest speech of his career, and had committed total reprisals from the United States in the event of a single nuclear device being exploded by the Soviet union in any country in the world outside Soviet territory. This thundering pronouncement, which had produced a growl of dismay from the American man-in-the-street, was greeted from Moscow by the feeble riposte that they would take similar action in answer to any Western nuclear device exploded on the territory of the USSR or her allies. A few days later Bond had been summoned again to Tiger\u0027s underground hideout. \u0027You will not of course repeat this,\u0027 Tiger had said with his wicked smile. \u0027But action in respect of the matter of which you are privately aware has been indefinitely postponed by the Central Authority.\u0027 \u0027Thank you for this private information,\u0027 Bond had said. \u0027But you do realize how your kindness of three weeks ago has greatly alleviated the international tension, particularly in relation to my country. My country would be immensely grateful if they knew of your personal generosity to me. Have I grounds for hoping for your further indulgence?\u0027 Bond had got used to the formalities of Oriental circumlocution, although he had not yet attained the refinements of Dikko\u0027s speech with Tiger, which included at least one four-letter word in each flowery sentence and which caused Tiger much amusement. \u0027Bondo-san, this implement which you wish to rent from us, in the most improbable event that it is made available, will command a very high price. As a fair trader, what has your country to offer in exchange for the full use of MAGIC 44?\u0027 \u0027We have a most important intelligence network in China known as the Macao \"Blue Route\". The fruits of this source would be placed entirely at your disposal.\u0027 Melancholy settled over Tiger\u0027s massive face, but deep down in the Tartar eyes there was a wicked gleam. \u0027I am very much afraid that I have bad news for you, Bondo-san. \"Blue Route\" has been penetrated by my organization almost since its inception. We already receive the entire fruits of that source. I could show you the files if you wish. We have simply renamed it \"Route Orange\", and I admit that the material is very acceptable. But we already have it. What other goods had you in mind for exchange?\u0027 Bond had to laugh. The pride of Section J - and of M., for that matter! The work, the expense, the danger of running the \u0027Blue Route\u0027. And at least fifty per cent in aid of Japan! By God, his eyes were being opened on this trip. This news would put a fine cat among the pigeons at HQ. He said blandly, \u0027We have many other commodities. Now that you have demonstrated the undoubted value of your implement, may I suggest that you name your price?\u0027 \u0027You believe that you have something on your shelves that is of comparable value? Perhaps material from a similar, though no doubt inferior, source that would be of equal importance in the defence of our country?\u0027 \u0027Undoubtedly,\u0027 said Bond staunchly. \u0027But, my dear Tiger, would it not be a good idea, once your mind is made up, for you to pay a visit to London and inspect the shelves for yourself? I am sure my Chief would be honoured to receive you.\u0027 \u0027You do not possess full powers of negotiation?\u0027 \u0027That would be impossible, my dear Tiger. Our security is such that even I have not full knowledge of all our merchandise. So far as I personally am concerned, I am only in a position to pass on to my Chief the substance of what you say or to render you any other personal services you might ask of me.\u0027 For a moment, Tiger Tanaka looked thoughtful. He seemed to be turning Bond\u0027s last words over in his mind. Then he closed the interview with the invitation to the geisha restaurant, and Bond went off with mixed feelings to report to Melbourne and London what he had gleaned. In the room where he now sat after the geisha party, and where Tiger had just cheerfully threatened him with death, tigers\u0027 heads snarled at him from the walls and gnashed at him from the floor. His ashtray was enclosed in a stuffed tiger\u0027s paw and the chair in which he was sitting was upholstered in tiger\u0027s skin. Mr Tanaka had been born in the year of the Tiger, whereas Bond, as Tiger had taken much pleasure in telling him, had been born in the year of the Rat. Bond took a deep drink of sake and said, \u0027My dear Tiger, I would hate to put you to the inconvenience of having to remove me from the face of the earth. You mean that this time the cedar may not bow before the typhoon? So be it. This time you have my very topmost word of honour.\u0027 Tiger pulled up a chair and faced Bond across the low drink table. He poured himself a liberal tot of Suntory and splashed in the soda. The sound of night traffic from the main Tokyo-Yokohama road came in from some way beyond the surrounding houses, only a few of which now showed doll\u0027s-house squares of yellow light. It was the end of September, but warm. It was ten minutes to midnight. Tiger began talking in a soft voice. \u0027In that case, my dear Bondo-san, and since I know you to be a man of honour, except, of course, in matters affecting your country, which this does not, I will tell you quite an interesting story. This is how it is.\u0027 He got out of his chair and sat down on the tatami and arranged himself in the lotus position. He was obviously more comfortable in this posture. He said, in an expository tone of voice, \u0027Ever since the beginning of the era of Meiji, who you will know was the Emperor who fathered the modernization and Westernization of Japan from the beginning of his reign nearly a hundred years ago, there have from time to time been foreigners who have come to this country and settled here. They have for the most part been cranks and scholars, and the European-born American Lafcadio Hearn, who became a Japanese citizen, is a very typical example. In general, they have been tolerated, usually with some amusement. So, perhaps, would be a Japanese who bought a castle in the Highlands of Scotland, and who learned and spoke Gaelic with his neighbours and expressed unusual and often impertinent interest in Scottish folkways. If he went about his researches politely and peaceably, he would be dubbed an amiable eccentric. And so it has been with the Westerners who have settled and spent their lives in Japan, though occasionally, in time of war, as would no doubt be the case with our mythical Japanese in Scotland, they have been regarded as spies and suffered internment and hardship. Now, since the occupation, there have been many such settlers, the great majority of whom, as you can imagine, have been American. The Oriental way of life is particularly attractive to the American who wishes to escape from a culture which, I am sure you will agree, has become, to say the least of it, more and more unattractive except to the lower grades of the human species to whom bad but plentiful food, shiny toys such as the automobile and the television, and the \"quick buck\", often dishonestly earned, or earned in exchange for minimal labour or skills, are the summum bonum, if you will allow the sentimental echo from my Oxford education.\u0027 \u0027I will,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027But is this not a picture of the life that is being officially encouraged in your own country?\u0027 Tiger Tanaka\u0027s face darkened perceptibly. \u0027For the time being,\u0027 he said with distaste, \u0027we are being subjected to what I can best describe as the \"Scuola di Coca-Cola\". Baseball, amusement arcades, hot dogs, hideously large bosoms, neon lighting - these are the part of our payment for defeat in battle. They are the tepid tea of the way of life we know under the name of demokorasu. They are a frenzied denial of the official scapegoats for our defeat - a denial of the spirit of the samurai as expressed in the kami-kaze, a denial of our ancestors, a denial of our gods. They are a despicable way of life\u0027 - Tiger almost spat the words - \u0027but fortunately they are also expendable and temporary. They have as much importance in the history of Japan as the life of a dragonfly.\u0027 He paused. \u0027But to return to my story. Our American residents are of a sympathetic type - on a low level of course. They enjoy the subservience, which I may say is only superficial, of our women. They enjoy the remaining strict patterns of our life - the symmetry, compared with the chaos that reigns in America. They enjoy our simplicity, with its underlying hint of deep meaning, as expressed for instance in the tea ceremony, flower arrangements, NO plays - none of which of course they understand. They also enjoy, because they have no ancestors and probably no family life worth speaking of, our veneration of the old and our worship of the past. For, in their impermanent world, they recognize these as permanent things just as, in their ignorant and childish way, they admire the fictions of the Wild West and other American myths that have become known to them, not through their education, of which they have none, but through television.\u0027 \u0027This is tough stuff, Tiger. I\u0027ve got a lot of American friends who don\u0027t equate with what you\u0027re saying. Presumably you\u0027re talking of the lower level GIs - second-generation Americans who are basically Irish or Germans or Czechs or Poles who probably ought to be working in the fields or coalmines of their countries of origin instead of swaggering around a conquered country under the blessed coverlet of the Stars and Stripes with too much money to spend. I daresay they occasionally marry a Japanese girl and settle down here. But surely they pull up stumps pretty quickly. Our Tommies have done the same thing in Germany. But that\u0027s quite a different thing from the Lafcadio Hearns of the world.\u0027 Tiger Tanaka bowed almost to the ground. \u0027Forgive me, Bondo-san. Of course you are right, and I have been diverted from my story down most unworthy paths. I did not ask you here to pour out my innermost repugnance at the occupation of my country. This of course is repugnance against the fact of defeat. I apologize. And of course you are correct. There are many cultured Americans who have taken up residence in this country and who are most valued citizens. You are right to correct me, for I have friends of this nature, in the arts, the sciences, in literature, and they are indeed valued members of the community. I was, let us say, letting off steam. You understand?\u0027 \u0027Of course, Tiger. My country has not been occupied for many centuries. The imposition of a new culture on an old one is something we have not suffered. I cannot imagine my reactions in the same circumstances. Much the same as yours, I expect. Please go on with your story.\u0027 Bond reached for the sake flask. It stood in a jar of warm water being heated over a slow flame from a charcoal burner. He filled his glass and drank. Tiger Tanaka rocked two or three times on his buttocks and the sides of his feet. He resumed. \u0027As I have said, there are a number of foreigners who have taken up residence in Japan and, for the most part, they are inoffensive eccentrics. But there is one such person who entered the country in January of this year who has revealed himself to be an eccentric of the most devilish nature. This man is a monster. You may laugh, Bondo-san, but this man is no less than a fiend in human form.\u0027 \u0027I have met many bad men in my time, Tiger, and generally they have been slightly mad. Is that the case in this instance?\u0027 \u0027Very much the reverse. The calculated ingenuity of this man, his understanding of the psychology of my people, show him to be a man of quite outstanding genius. In the opinion of our highest scholars and savants he is a scientific research worker and collector probably unique in the history of the world.\u0027 \u0027What does he collect?\u0027 \u0027He collects death.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584/47088.html","bookId":1266,"book":{"id":1266,"title":"007之雷霆谷 You Only Live Twice","description":"简介： 一天，美国太空船遭到了不明飞行物的攻击，美方怀疑是苏联的阴谋，目的是想独霸太空。美方测出了不明飞行物的降落地点是在日本，于是英国军方派出007（肖恩康纳利SeanConnery饰）前往日本替美方调查此事。由于007的身份特殊，直接进入日本容易被敌人察觉。为了掩人耳目...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/21/09-23-13-33-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
