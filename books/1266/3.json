{"id":43524,"no":3,"title":"3 THE IMPOSSIBLE MISSION","content":"M., HIS shoulders hunched inside the square-cut blue suit, was standing by the big window looking out across the park. Without looking round he said, \u0027Sit down.\u0027 No name, no number! \\n\\n Bond took his usual place across the desk from M.\u0027s tall-armed chair. He noticed that there was no file on the expanse of red leather in front of the chair. And the In and Out baskets were both empty. Suddenly he felt really bad about everything - about letting M. down, letting the Service down, letting himself down. This empty desk, the empty chair, were the final accusation. We have nothing for you, they seemed to say. You\u0027re no use to us any more. Sorry. It\u0027s been nice knowing you, but there it is. \\n\\n M. came over and sat heavily down in the chair and looked across at Bond. There was nothing to read in the lined sailor\u0027s face. It was as impassive as the polished blue leather of the empty chairback had been. \\n\\n M. said, \u0027You know why I\u0027ve sent for you?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I can guess, sir. You can have my resignation.\u0027 \\n\\n M. said angrily, \u0027What in hell are you talking about? It\u0027s not your fault that the Double-O Section\u0027s been idle for so long. It\u0027s the way things go. You\u0027ve had flat periods before now-months with nothing in your line.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027But I made a mess of the last two jobs. And I know my Medical\u0027s been pretty poor these last few months.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Nonsense. There\u0027s nothing the matter with you. You\u0027ve been through a bad time. You\u0027ve had good reason to be a bit under the weather. As for the last two assignments, anyone can make mistakes. But I can\u0027t have idle hands around the place, so I\u0027m taking you out of the Double-O Section.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond\u0027s heart had temporarily risen. Now it plummeted again. The old man was being kind, trying to let him down lightly. He said, \u0027Then, if it\u0027s all the same to you, sir, I\u0027d still like to put in my resignation. I\u0027ve held the Double-O number for too long. I\u0027m not interested in staff work, I\u0027m afraid, sir. And no good at it either.\u0027 \\n\\n M. did something Bond had never seen him do before. He lifted his right fist and brought it crashing down on the desk. \u0027Who the devil do you think you\u0027re talking to? Who the devil d\u0027you think\u0027s running this show? God in Heaven! I send for you to give you promotion and the most important job of your career and you talk to me about resignation I Pig-headed young fool!\u0027 \\n\\n Bond was dumbfounded. A great surge of excitement ran through him. What in hell was all this about? He said, \u0027I\u0027m terribly sorry, sir. I thought I\u0027d been letting the side down lately.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll soon tell you when you\u0027re letting the side down.\u0027 M. thumped the desk for a second time, but less hard. \u0027Now listen to me, I\u0027m giving you acting promotion to the Diplomatic Section. Four figure number and a thousand a year extra pay. You won\u0027t know much about the Section, but I can tell you there are only two other men in it. You can keep your present office and your secretary, if you like. In fact I would prefer it. I don\u0027t want your change of duty to get about. Understand?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027In any case, you\u0027ll be leaving for Japan inside a week. The Chief of Staff is handling the arrangements personally. Not even my secretary knows about it. As you can see,\u0027 M. waved his hand, \u0027there\u0027s not even a file on the case. That\u0027s how important it is.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027But why have you chosen me, sir?\u0027 Bond\u0027s heart was thumping. This was the most extraordinary change in his fortunes that had ever come about! Ten minutes before he had been on the rubbish heap, his career, his life in ruins, and now here he was being set up on a pinnacle! What the hell was it all about? \\n\\n For the simple reason that the job\u0027s impossible. No, I won\u0027t go as far as that. Let\u0027s say totally improbable of success. \\n\\n You\u0027ve shown in the past that you have an aptitude for difficult assignments. The only difference here is that there won\u0027t be any strong-arm stuff,\u0027 M. gave a frosty smile, \u0027none of the gun-play you pride yourself on so much. It\u0027ll just be a question of your wits and nothing else. But if you bring it off, which I very much doubt, you will just about double our intelligence about the Soviet union.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Can you tell me some more about it, sir?\u0027 \u0027Have to, as there\u0027s nothing written down. Lower echelon stuff, about the Japanese Secret Service and so forth, you can get from Section J. The Chief of Staff will tell Colonel Hamilton to answer your questions freely, though you will tell him nothing about the purpose of your mission. Understood?\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well now. You know a bit about cryptography?\u0027 \u0027The bare bones, sir. I\u0027ve preferred to keep clear of the subject. Better that way in case the Opposition ever got hold of me.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Quite right. Well now, the Japanese are past masters at it. They\u0027ve got the right mentality for finicky problems in letters and numbers. Since the war, under CIA guidance, they\u0027ve built incredible cracking machines - far ahead of IBM and so forth. And for the last year they\u0027ve been reading the cream of the Soviet traffic from Vladivostok and Oriental Russia - diplomatic, naval, air-force, the lot.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s terrific, sir.\u0027 \u0027Terrific for the CIA.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Aren\u0027t they passing it on to us, sir? I thought we were hand in glove with CIA all along the line.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Not in the Pacific. They regard that as their private preserve. When Allan Dulles was in charge, we used at least to get digests of any stuff that concerned us, but this new man McCone has cracked down on all that. He\u0027s a good man, all right, and we get along well personally, but he\u0027s told me candidly that he\u0027s acting under orders - National Defence Council. They\u0027re worried about our security. Can\u0027t blame them. I\u0027m equally worried about theirs. Two of their top cryptographers defected a couple of years ago and they must have blown a lot of the stuff we give the Americans. Trouble with this so-called democracy of ours is that the Press get hold of these cases and write them up too big. Pravda doesn\u0027t burst into tears when one of their men come over to us. Izvestia doesn\u0027t ask for a public inquiry. Somebody in KGB gets hell, I suppose. But at least they\u0027re allowed to get on with their job instead of having retired members of the Supreme Soviet pawing through their files and telling them how to run a secret service.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond knew that M. had tendered his resignation after the Prenderghast case. This had involved a Head of Station with homosexual tendencies who had recently, amidst world-wide publicity, been given thirty years for treason. Bond himself had had to give evidence in that particular case, and he knew that the Questions in the House, the case at the Old Bailey, and the hearings before the Farrer Tribunal on the Intelligence Services that had followed, had held up all work at Headquarters for at least a month and brought about the suicide of a totally innocent Head of Section who had taken the whole affair as a direct reflection on his own probity. To get M. back on the track, Bond said, \u0027About this stuff the Japanese are getting. Where do I come in, sir?\u0027 \\n\\n M. put both hands flat on the table. It was the old gesture when he came to the 64-dollar question, and Bond\u0027s heart lifted even further at the sight of it. \u0027There\u0027s a man in Tokyo called Tiger Tanaka. Head of their Secret Service. Can\u0027t remember what they call it. Some unpronounceable Japanese rubbish. He\u0027s quite a man. First at Oxford. Came back here and spied for them before the war. Joined the Kempeitai, their wartime Gestapo, trained as a kami-kaze and would be dead by now but for the surrender. Well, he\u0027s the chap who has control of the stuff we want, I want, the Chiefs of Staff want. You\u0027re to go out there and get it off him. How, I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s up to you. But you can see why I say you\u0027re unlikely to succeed. He\u0027s in fief - Bond was amused by the old Scottish expression -\u0027to the CIA. He probably doesn\u0027t think much of us.\u0027 M.\u0027s mouth bent down at the corners. \u0027People don\u0027t these days. They may be right or wrong. I\u0027m not a politician. He doesn\u0027t know much about the Service except what he\u0027s penetrated or heard from the CIA. And that won\u0027t be greatly to our advantage, I\u0027d say. We haven\u0027t had a Station in Japan since 1950. No traffic. It all went to the Americans. You\u0027ll be working under the Australians. They tell me their man\u0027s good. Section J says so too. Anyway, that\u0027s the way it is. If anyone can bring it off, you can. Care to have a try, James?\u0027 \\n\\n M.\u0027s face was suddenly friendly. It wasn\u0027t friendly often. James Bond felt a quick warmth of affection for this man who had ordered his destiny for so long, but whom he knew so little. His instinct told him that there were things hidden behind this assignment, motives which he didn\u0027t understand. Was this a rescue job on him? Was M. giving him his last chance? But it sounded solid enough. The reasons for it stood up. Hopeless? Impossible? Perhaps. Why hadn\u0027t M. chosen a Jap speaker? Bond had never been east of Hongkong. But then Orientalists had their own particular drawbacks - too much tied up with tea ceremonies and flower arrangements and Zen and so forth. No. It sounded a true bill. He said, \u0027Yes, sir. I\u0027d like to have a try.\u0027 \\n\\n M. gave an abrupt nod. \u0027Good.\u0027 He leant forward and pressed a button on the intercom. \u0027Chief of Staff? What number have you allotted to 007? Right. He\u0027s coming to see you straight away.\u0027 \\n\\n M. leant back. He gave one of his rare smiles. \u0027You\u0027re stuck with your old digit. All right, four sevens. Go along and get briefed.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond said, \u0027Right, sir. And, er, thank you.\u0027 He got up and walked over to the door and let himself out. He walked straight over to Miss Moneypenny and bent down and kissed her on the cheek. She turned pink and put a hand up to where he had kissed her. Bond said, \u0027Be an angel, Penny, and ring down to Mary and tell her she\u0027s got to get out of whatever she\u0027s doing tonight. I\u0027m taking her out to dinner. Scotts. Tell her we\u0027ll have our first roast grouse of the year and pink champagne. Celebration.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What of?\u0027 Miss Moneypenny\u0027s eyes were suddenly wide and excited. \\n\\n \u0027Oh I don\u0027t know. The Queen\u0027s birthday or something. Right?\u0027 James Bond crossed the room and went into the Chief - of Staff\u0027s office. \\n\\n Miss Moneypenny picked up the inter-office telephone and passed on the message in a thrilled voice. She said, \u0027I do think he\u0027s all right again, Mary. It\u0027s all there again like it used to be. Heaven knows what M.\u0027s been saying to him. He had lunch with Sir James Molony today. Don\u0027t tell James that. But it may have something to do with it. He\u0027s with the Chief of Staff now. And Bill said he wasn\u0027t to be disturbed. Sounds like some kind of a job. Bill was very mysterious.\u0027 \\n\\n Bill Tanner, late Colonel Tanner of the Sappers and Bond\u0027s best friend in the Service, looked up from his heavily laden desk. He grinned with pleasure at what he saw. He said, \u0027Take a pew, James. So you\u0027ve bought it? Thought you might. But it\u0027s a stinker all right. Think you can bring it off?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Not an earthly, I\u0027d guess,\u0027 said Bond cheerfully. \u0027This man Tanaka sounds a tough nut, and I\u0027m no great hand at diplomacy. But why did M. pick on me, Bill? I thought I was in the dog house because of messing up those last two jobs. I was all set to go into chicken farming. Now, be a good chap and tell me what\u0027s the real score.\u0027 \\n\\n Bill Tanner had been ready for that one. He said easily, \u0027Balls, James. You\u0027ve been running through a bad patch. We all hit \u0027em sometimes. M. just thought you\u0027d be the best man for the job. You know he\u0027s got an entirely misplaced opinion of your abilities. Anyway, it\u0027ll be a change from your usual rough-housing. Time you moved up out of that damned Double-O Section of yours. Don\u0027t you ever think about promotion?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Absolutely not,\u0027 said Bond with fervour. \u0027As soon as I get back from this caper, I\u0027ll ask for my old number back again. But tell me, how am I supposed to set about this business? What\u0027s this Australian cover consist of? Have I got anything to offer this wily Oriental in exchange for his jewels? How\u0027s the stuff to be transmitted back here if I do get my hands on it? Must be the hell of a lot of traffic.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027He can have the entire product of Station H. He can send one of his own staffers down to Hongkong to sit in with us if he likes. He\u0027ll probably be pretty well off on China already, but he won\u0027t have anything as high grade as our Macao link, the \"Blue Route\". Hamilton will tell you all about that. In Tokyo, the man you\u0027ll be working with is an Aussie called Henderson - Richard Lovelace Henderson. Fancy name, but Section J and all the old Jap hands say he\u0027s a good man. You\u0027ll have an Australian passport and we\u0027ll fix for you to go out as his number two. That\u0027ll give you diplomatic status and a certain amount of face, which counts for damn near everything out there according to Hamilton. If you get the stuff, Henderson will push it back to us through Melbourne. We\u0027ll give him a communications staff to handle it. Next question.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What are the CIA going to say about all this? After all, it\u0027s bare-faced poaching.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027They don\u0027t own Japan. Anyway, they\u0027re not to know. That\u0027s up to this fellow Tanaka. He\u0027ll have to fix the machinery for getting it into the Australian Embassy. That\u0027s his worry. But the whole thing\u0027s on pretty thin ice. The main problem is to make sure he doesn\u0027t go straight along to the CIA and tell \u0027em of your approach. If you get blown, we\u0027ll just have to get the Australians to hold the baby. They\u0027ve done it before when we\u0027ve been bowled out edging our way into the Pacific. We\u0027re good friends with their Service. First-rate bunch of chaps. And, anyway, the CIA\u0027s hands aren\u0027t as clean as all that. We\u0027ve got a whole file of cases where they\u0027ve crossed wires with us round the world. Often dangerously. We can throw that book at McCone if this business blows up in our faces. But part of your job is to see that it doesn\u0027t.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Seems to me I\u0027m getting all balled up in high politics. Not my line of country at all. But is this stuff really as vital as M. says?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Absolutely. If you get hold of it, your grateful country will probably buy you that chicken farm you\u0027re always talking about.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027So be it. Now, if you\u0027ll give Hamilton a buzz I\u0027ll go and start learning all about the mysterious East.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Kangei! Welcome aboard,\u0027 said the pretty kimono-ed and obi-ed stewardess of Japan Air Lines as, a week later, James Bond settled into the comfortable window seat of the four-jet, turbofan Douglas D C 8 at London Airport and listened to the torrent of soft Japanese coming from the tannoy that would be saying all those things about life jackets and the flying time to Orly. The sick-bags \u0027in case of motion disturbance\u0027 were embellished with pretty bamboo emblems and, according to the exquisitely bound travel folder, the random scribbles on the luggage rack above his head were\u0027the traditional and auspicious tortoiseshell motif. The stewardess bowed and handed him a dainty fan, a small hot towel in a wicker-basket and a sumptuous menu that included a note to the effect that an assortment of cigarettes, perfumes and pearls were available for sale. Then they were off with 50,000 pounds of thrust on the first leg of the four that would take the good aircraft Yoshino over the North Pole to Tokyo. \\n\\n Bond gazed at the picture of three oranges (no! after an hour he decided they were persimmons) in a blue bowl that faced him and, when the aircraft flattened out at 30,000 feet, ordered the first of the chain of brandies and ginger ales that was to sustain him over the Channel, a leg of the North Sea, the Kattegat, the Arctic Ocean, the Beaufort Sea, the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean and decided that, whatever happened on this impossible assignment, he would put up no resistance to his old skin being sloughed off him on the other side of the world. By the time he was admiring the huge stuffed Polar bear at Anchorage, in Alaska, the embrace of JAL\u0027s soft wings had persuaded him that he didn\u0027t even mind if the colour of the new skin was to be yellow. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584/47085.html","bookId":1266,"book":{"id":1266,"title":"007之雷霆谷 You Only Live Twice","description":"简介： 一天，美国太空船遭到了不明飞行物的攻击，美方怀疑是苏联的阴谋，目的是想独霸太空。美方测出了不明飞行物的降落地点是在日本，于是英国军方派出007（肖恩康纳利SeanConnery饰）前往日本替美方调查此事。由于007的身份特殊，直接进入日本容易被敌人察觉。为了掩人耳目...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/21/09-23-13-33-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
