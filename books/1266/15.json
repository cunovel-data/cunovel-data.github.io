{"id":43536,"no":15,"title":"15 THE SIX GUARDIANS","content":"THE next day was as golden as the first and the haul of awabi went up to sixty-eight, largely thanks to Bond\u0027s improved diving. \\n\\n The evening before, Kissy had come back from selling her shells at the market and had found Bond writhing on the floor of his room with cramps in his stomach muscles and her mother clucking helplessly over him. She had shooed her mother away, spread the soft futon on the floor beside him and had pulled off his bathing pants and rolled him on to the futon face downwards. Then she had stood upright on his back and had walked softly up and down his spine from his buttocks to his neck, and the ache had slowly gone. She told him to lie still and brought him warm milk. Then she led him into the tiny bathhouse and poured hot and then tepid water over him from an awabi tub until all the salt was out of his skin and hair. She dried him softly, rubbed warm milk into his sunburn and his chafed hands, and led him back to his room, telling him with gentle sternness to go to sleep and to call her if he awoke in the night and needed anything. She blew out his candle and left him, and he went out, to the night-song of the cricket in its cage, like a light. \\n\\n In the morning, nothing remained of his aches except the soreness of the hands, and Kissy gave him the rare treat of an egg beaten up in his rice and bean curd and he apologized for his bad manners of the night before. She said, \u0027Todoroki-san, you have the spirit of ten samurai, but you have the body of only one. I should have known that I had asked too much of that single body. It was the pleasure of the day. It made me forget everything else. So it is I who apologize, and today we will not go so far. Instead, we will keep close to the cliffs of the island and see what we can find. I will do the rowing, for it is a small distance, but you will be able to do more diving because the place that I know of, which I haven\u0027t visited for many weeks, is inshore and the water is, at the most, twenty feet deep.\u0027 \\n\\n And so it had been, and Bond had worn a shirt to protect him from the sun and his tally of shells had gone up to twenty-one, and the solitary shadow of the day had been the clear view he had had of the black fortress across the straits and the chunky yellow-and-black warning balloon that flew the column of black ideograms above it. \\n\\n During one of their rests, Bond casually asked Kissy what she knew of the castle, and he was surprised by the way her face darkened. \u0027Todoroki-san, we do not usually talk about that place. It is almost a forbidden subject on Kuro. It is as if hell had suddenly opened its mouth half a mile away across the sea from our home. And my people, the Ama, are like what I have read about your gipsies. We are very superstitious. And we believe the devil himself has come to live over there.\u0027 She didn\u0027t look at the fortress, but gestured with her head. \u0027Even the kanushi-san does not deny our fears, and our elders say that the gatjins have always been bad for Japan and that this one is the incarnation of all the evil in the West. And there is already a legend that has grown up on the island. It is that our six Jizo Guardians will send a man from across the sea to slay this \"King of Death\", as we call him.\u0027 \u0027Who are these Guardians?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Jizo is the god who protects children. He is, I think, a Buddhist god. On the other side of the island, on the foreshore, there are five statues. The sixth has been mostly washed away. They are rather frightening to see. They squat there in a line. They have rough bodies of stone and round stones for heads and they wear white shirts that are changed by the people every month. They were put there centuries ago by our ancestors. They sit on the line of low tide, and as the tide comes up it covers them completely and they keep watch under the surface of the sea and protect us, the Ama, because we are known as \"The Children of the Sea\". At the beginning of every June, when the sea is warm after the winter and the diving begins, every person on the island forms into a procession and we go to the Six Guardians and sing to them to make them happy and favourable towards us.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027And this story of the man from Kuro. Where did it come from?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Who knows? It could have come from the sea or the air and thus into the minds of the people. Where do stories like that come from? It is widely believed.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Ah, so desu ka!\u0027 said Bond, and they both laughed and got on with the work. \\n\\n On the third day, when Bond was as usual eating his breakfast on the doorstep, Kissy came to the doorway and said softly, \u0027Come inside, Todoroki-san.\u0027 Mystified, he went in and she shut the door behind him. \\n\\n She said in a low voice, \u0027I have just heard from a messenger from the kannushi-san that there were people here yesterday in a boat from the mainland. They brought presentos - cigarettes and sweets. They were asking about the visit of the police boat. They said it came with three visitors and left with only two. They wanted to know what had happened to the third visitor. They said they were guards from the castle and it was their duty to prevent trespassers. The elders accepted the presentos, but they showed shiran-kao, which is \"the face of him who knows nothing\", and referred the men to the kannushi-san who said that the third visitor was in charge of fishing licences. He had felt sick on the way to the island and had perhaps lain down in the boat on the way back. Then he dismissed the men and sent a boy to the top of the High Place to see where the boat went, and the boy reported that it went to the bay beside the castle and was put back into the boathouse that is there. The kannusbi-san thought that you should know these things.\u0027 She looked at him piteously. \u0027Todoroki-san, I have a feeling of much friendship for you. I feel that there are secret things between you and the kannushi-san, and that they concern the castle. I think you should tell me enough to put me out of my unhappiness.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond smiled. He went up to her and took her face in both his hands and kissed her on the lips. He said, \u0027You are very beautiful and kind, Kissy. Today we will not take the boat out because I must have some rest. Lead me up to the High Place from which I can take a good look at this castle and I will tell you what I can. I was going to anyway, for I shall need your help. Afterwards, I would like to visit the Six Guardians. They interest me - as an anthropologist.\u0027 \\n\\n Kissy collected their usual lunch in a small basket, put on her brown kimono and rope-soled shoes and they set off along a small footpath that zigzagged up the peak behind the crouching grey cluster of the village. The time of the camellia was almost past, but here there were occasional bushes of wild camellias in red and white, and there was a profusion of these round a small grove of dwarf maples, some of which already wore their flaming autumn colours. The grove was directly above Kissy\u0027s house. She led him in and showed him the little Shinto shrine behind a rough stone torь. She said, \u0027Behind the shrine there is a fine cave, but the people of Kuro are afraid of it as it is full of ghosts. But I explored it once and if there are ghosts there they are friendly ones,\u0027 She clapped her hands before the shrine, bent her head for a moment, and clapped them again. Then they went on up the path to the top of the thousand-foot peak. A brace of gorgeous copper pheasants with golden tails fled squawking over the brow and down to a patch of bushes on the southern cliff as they approached. Bond told Kissy to stay out of sight while he went and stood behind the tall cairn of stones on the summit and gazed circumspectly round it and across the straits. \\n\\n He could see over the high fortress wall and across the park to the towering black-and-gold donjon of the castle. It was ten o\u0027clock. There were figures in blue peasant dress with high boots and long staves moving busily about the grounds. They occasionally seemed to prod into the bushes with their staves. They wore black maskos over their mouths. It crossed Bond\u0027s mind that they might be doing the morning rounds looking for overnight prey. What did they do when they found some half-blinded creature, or a pile of clothes beside one of the fumaroles whose little clouds of steam rose here and there in the park? Take them to the Doctor? And, in the case of the living, what happened then? And when he, Bond, got up that wall tonight, where was he going to hide from the guards? Well, sufficient unto the day! At least the straits were calm and it was cloudless weather. It looked as if he would get there all right. Bond turned away and went back to Kissy and sat with her on the sparse turf. He gazed across the harbour to where the Ama fleet lay sprawled across the middle distance. \\n\\n He said, \u0027Kissy, tonight I have to swim to the castle and climb the wall and get inside.\u0027 \\n\\n She nodded. \u0027I know this. And then you are going to kill this man and perhaps his wife. You are the man who we believe was to come to Kuro from across the sea and do these things.\u0027 She continued to gaze out to sea. She said dully, \u0027But why have you been chosen? Why should it not be another, a Japanese?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027These people are gaijins. I am a gaijin. It will cause less trouble for the State if the whole matter is presented as being trouble between foreigners.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes, I see. And has the kannushi-san given his approval?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027And if… And after. Will you come back and be my boatman again?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027For a time. But then I must go back to England.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No. I believe that you will stay for a long time on Kuro.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why do you believe that?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Because I prayed for it at the shrine. And I have never asked for such a big thing before. I am sure it will be granted.\u0027 She paused. \u0027And I shall be swimming with you tonight.\u0027 She held up a hand. \u0027You will need company in the dark and I know the currents. You would not get there without me.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond took the small dry paw in his. He looked at the childish, broken nails. His voice was harsh. He said, \u0027No. This is man\u0027s work.\u0027 \\n\\n She looked at him. The brown eyes were calm and serious. She said, and she used his first name, \u0027Taro-san, your other name may mean thunder, but I am not frightened of thunder. I have made up my mind. And I shall come back every night, at midnight exactly, and wait among the rocks at the bottom of the wall. I shall wait for one hour in case you need my help in coming home. These people may harm you. Women are much stronger in the water than men. That is why it is the Ama girls who dive and not the Ama men. I know the waters round Kuro as a peasant knows the fields round his farm, and I have as little fear of them. Do not be stiff-necked in this matter. In any case, I shall hardly sleep until you come back. To feel that I am close to you for a time and that you may need me will give me some peace. Say yes, Taro-san.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh, all right, Kissy,\u0027 said Bond gruffly. \u0027I was only going to ask you to row me to a starting point down there somewhere.\u0027 He gestured to the left across the straits. \u0027But if you insist on being an extra target for the sharks…\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027The sharks never trouble us. The Six Guardians look after that. We never come to any harm. Years ago, \u0027one of the Amas caught her rope in a rock underwater, and the people have talked of the accident ever since. The sharks just think we are big fish like themselves.\u0027 She laughed happily. \u0027Now it is all settled and we can have something to eat and then I \\n\\n will take you down to see the Guardians. The tide will be low by then and they will want to inspect you.\u0027 \\n\\n They followed another little path from the summit. It went over the shoulder of the peak and down to a small protected bay to the east of the village. The tide was far out and they could wade over the flat black pebbles and rocks and round the corner of the promontory. Here, on a stretch of flat stony beach, five people squatted on a square foundation of large rocks and gazed out towards the horizon. Except that they weren\u0027t people. They were, as Kissy had described, stone pedestal bodies with large round boulders cemented to their tops. But rough white shirts were roped round them, and they looked terrifyingly human as they sat in immobile judgement and guardianship over the waters and what went on beneath them. Of the sixth, only the body remained. His head must have been destroyed by a storm. \\n\\n They walked round in front of the five and looked up at the smooth blank faces and Bond, for the first time in his life, had a sensation of deep awe. So much belief, so much authority seemed to have been invested by the builders in these primitive, faceless idols, guardians of the blithe, naked Ama girls, that Bond had a ridiculous urge to kneel and ask for their blessing as the Crusaders had once done before their God. He brushed the impulse aside, but he did bow his head and briefly ask for good fortune to accompany his enterprise. And then he stood back and watched with a pull at his heartstrings while Kissy, her beautiful face strained and pleading, clapped to attract their attention and then made a long and impassioned speech in which his name recurred. At the end, when she again clapped her hands, did the round boulder-heads briefly nod? Of course not! But, when Bond took Kissy\u0027s hand and they walked away, she said happily, \u0027It is all right, Todoroki-san. You saw them nod their heads?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Bond firmly, \u0027I did not.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They crept round the eastern shore of Kuro and pulled the boat up into a deep cleft in the black rocks. It was just after eleven o\u0027clock and the giant moon rode high and fast through wisps of mackerel cloud. They talked softly, although they were out of sight of the fortress and half a mile away from it. Kissy took off her brown kimono and folded it neatly and put it in the boat. Her body glowed in the moonlight. The black triangle between her legs beckoned, and the black string round her waist that held the piece of material was an invitation to untie it. She giggled provocatively. \u0027Stop looking at my Black Cat!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why is it called that?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Guess!\u0027 \\n\\n Bond carefully pulled on his ninja suit of black cotton. It was comfortable enough and would give warmth in the water. He left the head-shroud hanging down his back and pushed the goggles that belonged to Kissy\u0027s father up his forehead. The small floating pack he was to tow behind him rode jauntily in the waters of the creek, and he tied its string firmly to his right wrist so that he would always know it was there. \\n\\n He smiled at Kissy and nodded. \\n\\n She came up to him and threw her arms round his neck and kissed him full on the lips. \\n\\n Before he could respond, she had pulled down her goggles and had dived into the quiet, mercury sea. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584/47097.html","bookId":1266,"book":{"id":1266,"title":"007之雷霆谷 You Only Live Twice","description":"简介： 一天，美国太空船遭到了不明飞行物的攻击，美方怀疑是苏联的阴谋，目的是想独霸太空。美方测出了不明飞行物的降落地点是在日本，于是英国军方派出007（肖恩康纳利SeanConnery饰）前往日本替美方调查此事。由于007的身份特殊，直接进入日本容易被敌人察觉。为了掩人耳目...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/21/09-23-13-33-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
